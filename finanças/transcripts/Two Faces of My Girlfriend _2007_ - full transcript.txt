Presented by Showbox Mediaplex, Inc. Produced by FineWorks, Inc. How was the first night? How about honeymoon? I bet you guys were wild. You look so happy. You've become so different since the marriage. Even your tie is different. Envious? Get married, too. Oh, really? I would, if I had a girlfriend. Are you happily married? Producer: HEO Chang - Of course. - It's been only 2 weeks. Didn't you confess your love to a different girl 6 months ago? I loved her back then. - Now? - Madly in love with my wife. What's that about? What are you, an animal? A hound dog? A Don Juan? You call that love? It takes a lot of relationships to find your true love, right? - Sure. - True love? There's no such thing. You're totally mistaken. You think she married you for love? No way. She wouldn't have if you weren't a doctor. You're so ugly. You know what? He married her for her money. That's bullshit. What do you know about love? Love never lasts. It does nothing but hurt you. It always expires too soon. Cheers! Directed by LEE Seok-hoon Guchang... What? You're a virgin, aren't you? You've never kissed, have you? He should be registered as a UNESCO World Heritage. He's a rare species. A rare species! A rare species! I had my first kiss back in high school. How can I kiss when I don't have a girl? Nobody likes to date a bum. I want to kiss, too! A soft, wet tongue of a girl... I want to feel it, too. But I can't kiss a stranger, can I? A girl with an aura over her head... I want to meet such a girl! He's at it again. Disgusting. We don't know him. His first kiss with pig. I think the pig is male. - Number 17? - Yes. Watch Movie You did the blue line of subway, right? - Yes. - Thanks. Number 18, Ms. NA Anni? NA Anni? She's gone. Her legs were hurting her. I can't believe her! Mom, I'm on my way home. Two Faces of My Girlfriend Uncle, you sure you're good at Taekwondo? I learned it in the army. So why pay someone else? Your master has a car, a house... And a girlfriend. But... What about me? I have nothing. You feel sorry for me? Yes. You will tell mommy? No. Who will teach you Taekwondo? You! You're a good boy, Donggu. Donggu... You believe in ghosts? No. Right? They don't exist. A ghost took your cell phone? No way. That's nonsense. You're so funny. Call your cell phone. Somebody must have it. Hello? - Ghost #18? - Yes. This is the movie company. You can't take off like that! Return your costume and shoes! I must've been too drunk. Ghost #18 speaking. Hello? Hi, Master KIM. What? Donggu quit Taekwondo? Oh, he said that his uncle would teach him? You! Hey! Hey! Stop there! Now you con your own nephew? Cause you don't give me money! Shut up! What are you doing? It's just that... I found this wallet. And I can't find the owner with no ID in it. Put it on the bulletin board. That will work, but... I think that's my wallet. I was looking for it. - Here. - Yes. Thanks. Excuse me! Wait! Wait! Did you go through my wallet? I just wanted to see if it had an ID in it. What am I gonna do? It was in here. Where'd it go? It was in here. Where'd it go? I forgot to bring my wallet, so... I didn't think... Give me $3. I'm sorry. I'm talking about a photo. Didn't you see it? I do this when I'm upset. A sophomore? A junior? I didn't mean for this to happen. I'm sorry about the photo. You guys looked close. Take another one. I guess not. Hey there. Crying makes you hungry. Want some rice cake? How much is it? That's what you took from me. You don't have $3? Not even a dime. - You take cards? - You kidding me? A real man never makes a girl cry. Here, it's on me. Listen. If you make a girl cry again, I'll kick your butt! Got it? Yes. Enjoy it. Bye. Here. I love rice cake. It looks so good. You want some? It's good. Isn't it? It's even better when dipped in the crumbs. Anyway... You guys broke up? Yes, you got the right answer. Good job. Do this one now. You're breaking his focus. You can pay me now. Smartass... You... OUT TO THE SEA Marine Boys No applicants? What's wrong with us? Think about it. No girl would join the club named Marine Boys. The problem isn't the name, but your looks. And look what others are doing. You can't just sit around here. Get out there and bring some potentials! Come on, move it! Huh? Hey there, come here. Come on. Marine Boys... my ass. Do I get to see the ocean if I join? Of course, you will. Really? I've never been to the ocean. Seriously? Look. What's your name? Guchang. Guchang... It's a weird name. I'm Anni. - Anni? - Anni! Okay, Anni. There's this bird living in the Amazon. It cries out loudly like this when it desires love. My ex would copy its cry when he felt like kissing me. And I hear it these days even without him around. You think I'm crazy? I had a pet chick when I was little. It died after 3 days of chirping. After that, I kept hearing it. In the bathroom, in the kitchen... I heard it everywhere. You're not crazy. Oh, I hear it! I do! Come on, listen with me. - What are they doing? - Earsing. 'Earsing'? They're letting their ears kiss. You have a great appetite. Yes. Can I try this? Sure. How about that? Eat whatever you want. Can I try everything here? Go ahead. I'm not as poor as you think. Give this, this, and this. Give me $40 worth. Just $4 worth for now. I'm full now. Wanna go ride a boat? A boat? A love boat? So fun! Put your hands up! Let's ride it again. - Guchang, I'm getting sick. - What?! - I'm about to puke. - What? Don't! Keep it in! Keep it in! Swallow it! - No... No! - Swallow it! Try to hold it. Good. No! Keep it in! No! Don't! Don't! - Mob it clean, man. - Okay. Don't miss a spot. Get that, too. What the hell did she eat? Are you upset about the money? I didn't wanna ride it. You're loaded. $200 is a drop in the bucket for rich people. My mother and I freeload off my sister. She got her house from her ex husband. Why'd she get divorced? I don't know. Her husband left her cause we were sponging on them. To get money from her... This is my 7th year in college. You live such a pathetic life. Do you believe in God? I don't know. This isn't fair. He created us flawed. We should be recalled. Recalled? Yes. He might've forgotten about us. Should we remind him? I wish I knew how. It's easy. Watch me. I do exist! I... DO... EXIST! Go head. I... - Come on. - This is embarrassing. I DO EXIST! I DO EXIST! I DO EXIST! - I DO EXIST! - I DO EXIST! Thanks. I feel a lot better now. No, thanks for being with me on a day like this. A day like what? It's my birthday. I didn't even have cake. Marine Boys - Hold on. - Okay. Watch your step. Happy Birthday! We were in the climbing club back in high school. We went to this mountain in the summer. And he had great thighs. They charmed me. His thighs? He got into this school. So I came here after him. But this bitch snatched him away from me. - Drink. - That bitch... So I'm very lonely and get scared at night. Anyway, I was wondering if any of you... Who wants to be my man? Who wants to be my man? - Me! - Pick me! Who wants to be my man? Me! I knew it. Come here, sweetie. Bingo! What's going on here? Damn, I was saving it. Where are you going? It's okay. Who wants to be my man? Just tell me... You smoke? Did you pick my flower? What? My flower! I didn't see any flowers. Oh, this is bubble gum. This... Is this... grape flavor? You put drugs in my drinks. What drugs? A pig stimulant. Come on, you're not a pig. Why would I ever do that? Funny? Of course, it is. Listen, I'm not capable of doing such a thing. What I want is... Aren't they wild or what? You drugged me. No, I didn't. Okay, then you got me drunk and screwed me? I didn't screw anything! Save it! What the...! What? What's that bottle for? Get on your head. No way. I won't. On your head now. I was going to. Let me clean it first. Good. Clean it up, okay? Okay. - Do it right. - Okay. - Do it right. - Okay. - No faking. - Okay. - Got it? - Yes. Do it for 20 minutes more after I leave. Okay. If I see you again, I'll reconstruct your face. Okay. - Okay? - Yes. I heard you met a girlfriend. Is that true? She's a dog, isn't she? Are you sure she's not a he? Tell me about her. She is... Nothing much to say. Why? She's that ugly? If she doesn't look like a troll, stay with her. She's very pretty. But... When she's drunk, she goes crazy. She beat me up. Guchang, listen to me. A pretty girl with no flaws would never date you. Right? Considering your flaws, that's nothing. Start working out. I'm home. Why's she sleeping here? If you miss the smell of a man, why'd you divorce him? What's this? Oh, God! Stop pulling it! - Stop it! - A thief! He's a pervert! Sister! Stop it! It's me! Oh, my god! Who's it? - What? - Why let her into the house? You guys are close. She said that? - I don't know her well. - Really? You slept with her. Who did? I did? You didn't? Oh, we did sleep together. You bastard! Help yourself. So nicely peeled. Guchang, eat some. What happened to your face? Somebody beat you up? He was exposed to briquette gas when he was little. He got weird after that. If we'd found out sooner... That explains... Your friend told me you got hurt. Did I do anything wrong? You should stop drinking. Oh... when I'm drunk, I fall asleep. Stay asleep then. Look, those kids... He's my nephew. You don't have money? Donggu, what are you doing? Get over here. Uncle! I can't believe you boys. They're little kids. What are you? Wanna be a hero in front of your chick? Donggu? Go call the police. Damn, he's funny. Have some respect for someone older, punks! Shut up, asshole. We look a lot older than you. You've seen too many movies. Haven't you? You think she'll turn violent and knock us out? Like they do in movies? - Better think again. - Here. Shit! What a couple of nutcases! I'm sorry, but you have a pimple on your nose. I picked it. You crazy bitch! Anni, are you okay? Hey! Watch it, punks! - Oh, I'm scared. - He's damn scary. I'll kick your asses! Leave them to me. Are you okay? I got it! You're dead! Where are you going? I'll break your spine! Break my what? I have no mercy for girls. Keep it up, and this nuclear punch will land on your face. I'll make it simple for us. Just one punch for each. Fine. Who goes first? I'm heads, and you're tails. OK? OK. My leg... I'm sorry. Are you okay? Hey, wake up. Anni? Anni, wake up. Guchang... I'm cold. What? I'm cold. How could this fragile lady beat the crap out of you? Right, sir? What happened was... He hit me and I became unconscious. When he came to, they were on the ground. Guchang saved me. No, the truth is... My uncle learned Taekwondo in the army. Wow, you must be real good. Officer! It's that bitch. She beat us all up. We should pay you respect. Get up, guys. Let us salute a righteous man who fights crime. A multiple personality is like a self-defense. Let's say something really bad happened to you. And you can't cope with the shock. A new character is created in you to forget the pain. A broken-heart can be the cause? It's possible, depending how you take it. I'm sure you've had events that you wish you could forget. I don't think so. You had to get circumcised again because you got the wood... ...watching the nurse's ass minutes after the first one. You wish it had ever happened, right? One time, you got so drunk that you shit in your bed. Didn't you get mugged by some elementary school kids? There were five of them, and huge. Your life is just a mess. Let me take a picture of you. One, two, three... Ms. KIM, why don't you tell us about yourself in English? - Hello? - I must've gone crazy. I'm having a job interview, so... Please, call me crazy bitch. I can't talk right now. No, no, no! No, don't hang up. Please, call me crazy bitch. Crazy bitch! Crazy bitch! Crazy bitch! Crazy bitch! Do you know how important that job interview was to me? I don't think so. You'll never know. You know what? I'm crazy. I am! Wait... You want this? You'll feel better if you pop them. Why'd you call? It looks real. Why did you take it? Are you nuts? I must be. Take a look at this. I don't remember getting it. I feel like I'm losing myself. And I didn't steal that ring. What's wrong with me? It must be the break-up. You're just recovering from it. Don't they feed you beans in jail? Beans? Don't worry. You're not going to jail. Just return the ring. I don't have to eat beans? I hate them. You won't have to. Come on, let's go return the ring. Do we have to walk like this? It'll raise suspicion. Nice. They must live together. The laundry... Just put the ring back and leave. My heart is beating so hard. I'm so nervous. That... Did you do that? I don't know. I can't remember. I know it's hard. Yeah, cry as much as you want to and forget about him. Let him go for your sake. Honey... Be happy. - Don't joke around - Shh! - It happens all the time. - I'm sorry. If you're sorry... Find it. Okay. - Is it there? - No. - Where is it? - Look in the drawer. What? I found it! I knew it was in there. You think we can make it in the Antarctic? It's dangerous out there. Don't worry. You know I'm strong. I don't think so. You broke your arm last time when we went climbing. This? It won't hurt if you kiss it. You sure? Come on. We're late for the movie. Let's go. You have good ears. I couldn't hear anything. Guchang... Am I not attractive? You're very attractive. It's just that... Sometimes you become different. Is that why he left me? It's weird. I find myself in a strange place when I wake up. I feel so full though I ate nothing. And I feel like a cigarette. I must be crazy. Love is a crazy thing. Sacrifice? Unconditional love? I don't buy that. It's that dopamine in the brain playing tricks on you. No, love isn't like that. Love is all about hormones. His hormone production ended before yours did. And you need to find someone else to help your hormone production. Yeah, that's it. Easier said than done. How about this? Why don't you produce some hormones for me? What? I want you to love me. So I can forget about him. No? Not that I don't want to, but there are some bases to cover. Oh, bases? Let's kiss then. That's first base. Have you kissed? Have I kissed? Sure, I kiss like I shake hands. Should we kiss now? Here? There are people walking by... Don't want to? Yes! I would love to kiss you. Let's do it. But with eyes closed. Close your eyes. Eyes... I'll kiss you now. - Yes! Is that okay? - Yes! - All right, here we go. - Yes. You're digging your grave, asshole. I said if I see you again, I'll reconstruct your face. Does it hurt? It's okay. Sterilize it. This boilermaker is good. By the way, Ma'am... What should I call you? Hanni. Oh, Hanni. You're so broadminded like a man. You bastard... Do I look like a girl to you? Respect me like your big brother. Let me ask you something. - Sure. - When do you come out, Big Brother? - Huh? -So you can work on her when I'm gone? - I told you it wasn't that. - Save it, asshole. I checked into it. This male figure of yours isn't real. Frankly, it's a fake. Then why is a fake pretending to be real? You know what? I should protect Anni. Drinking, smoking, hitting me... You call that protection? Let me tell you something, Bro. This boy isn't for yourself only. You should consider another life living in your body. - You're pregnant. - Son of a bitch! You knocked her up? I warned you about hurting girls. Now you're drinking with a pregnant woman? What's wrong with you? - You piece of... - That's not it. Save it, asshole! Better take care of her! Stop laughing. How will you take care of me? I'm pregnant now. Stop laughing. You call yourself a man? Let's take it outside. - Forget it. - Stop laughing and come out! Damn! Listen to me carefully. If I lose, I'll leave Anni alone. If you lose... Don't move when I'm talking. Don't move! I've been putting up with... It hurts! And that was cheap! Nothing is cheap in a fight. What, you'll hit a girl with a brick? You said you weren't a girl. I was joking. I'm a girl. Okay, I'll put it down first. Let's make it cool. Put down the brick. Come on. Good. You're gonna hit a fragile guy with that? I'm not doing this. No way. Stay out of Anni's life. Get it straight. I didn't seek her. She sought me. What, you think she likes you? Think about it. If not, why would she ask me to kiss her? She was just devastated after the breakup. She would've dated anybody. Listen carefully. Just because you can fight, you don't scare me. I was being easy on you. Keep talking. I'm just... I've never felt this way about anybody. And I don't wanna lose this god-given chance. So please, do me a favor and leave me alone. Go back to your planet. On an empty stomach? What? Buy me some pork. Let's go. Crazy bastard... You liked kissing her? So wet and soft... It was like a living jelly. So you're going steady with her? I hate that chain-smoker chick beating me up. But it isn't too bad. You're crazy. Can you get me a part-time job? Why? It costs to date two women. It feels like being a two timer. You're nuts. Hook me up, okay? Are you into art? Art? What are you doing? Lift him. I got water in my nose! In my nose... Damn! Show me this one. Here you go. Hey, it's me. Wanna go to dinner? I can't. Why not? It's just... You're not spying on him, are you? Don't turn yourself into a stalker. - Where are you? - Sorry. I gotta go. Hello? God. - Close your eyes. - What is it? Keep them closed. Here! It's pretty. Many things can happen in the Antarctic. Blow it when you're in danger. Wherever you go, I'll be there. I won't leave your side. To the end of the world? To the end of the world. You're having blind dates without me? Let me come with you. But you have a girlfriend. - Who? - Keep the fish in your pond. How far have you and Anni gone? What are you talking about? She's not my girlfriend. And you know what? She's messed up in the head. That's why her ex dumped her. Why would I eat leftovers where there's fresh food out there? That is leftover. What am I, a beggar? Anni! I'm sorry about what I said. I didn't mean it. You're not over him yet, and I was... What do you know about love? You don't know anything. Right, I don't know love. But I know what it's like to be dumped. There are many people who suffer from broken hearts. And I live with two of them. My mom and sister... Being dumped isn't a good thing. Without getting over him, you can't be happy. You're so pretty and lovely. You deserve someone better. Will anybody love me? Of course. When I first saw you... What's that on your face? Huh? On your face... My hair is turning gray so I dyed it. I don't think... Anni, are you hungry? - Yes. - Feel like some pork? Yes, let's go. Something must've happened. They said they were there. When we got there, their cell phones were off. Your face must've scared them away! Look who's talking, Chicken Head! There must've been a mix-up. You guys are so cute. - Isn't it good? - Good. Who wants it? Good, isn't it? - Hey, look at me. - Tell me I'm pretty. - I'm wearing skirt for you. - Look at me. I was always young to you. - It's little bit awkward to say love. - But my heart - realized. - Call me, call me, call, call, give a call - If you want me, I'll give you. - You've been waiting for a long time, I'm yours. - I'm yours forever. On your head. Get up. On your head. Assholes... I told you I wasn't messing around. Get up, boys. Guchang. Is there more meat? That's all. Get some more then! You don't remember, but you ate quite a bit. I didn't. Anni did. These boys have no clue. Let's just go, okay? Stop eating, or you'll get fat. Fine. Stupid asses, you think you are in the Marine Corps? Take off those goggles. Take them off now. You look better with them on. Make me sick. Thanks. Don't cause any more trouble. Go home. You're leaving? Hey! Stay with me. Doing what? Do you like Anni? You do, don't you? What am I, a dog? I come and go as you signal me to? There's this song called... 'Love is like raindrops outside the window.' Question! Why is love like raindrops outside the window? Because they evaporate! Not only do they evaporate... ...they leave stains behind. That's love. Still up for it? I am, because I like her. Call Anni. Your voice will bring her out. Now? Anni? Anni? Not yet! Anni? Anni? I fell asleep again? I always do when I'm drunk. It's raining. He liked it raining a lot. We'd come here on a rainy day... ...and watched it raining outside. Though we didn't talk much... I felt so comfortable. When it rains, I like drinking... You know what he did? He wrote our names on the bottom of those dolls. You don't wanna hear it, do you? No, it's okay. I'm a little understanding. That's not true. You're very understanding. Very much... - Guchang. - Yes? Mind if I go to the bathroom? Sure. Guchang. Yuri? Where are you going? He's leaving for the Antarctic. Stop it. If he wants to go, let him go. No, I have to stop him. He shouldn't go there. - Let's go. - Let me go. I'm sorry. 19th Antarctic Expedition Let's go! Go. Don't go! Please, don't go! Don't go... Don't go... Oh God... Don't go... Miss, who are you talking to? There's nobody here. Are you okay? All the flights have been canceled due to the bad weather. Go home, okay? This? It won't hurt if you kiss it. Blow it when you're in danger in the Antarctic. Miss? Miss? Can you hear me, Miss? This is Section B. Send a paramedic right now. Miss? Miss? Yuri... Why'd you go to the airport? I don't know. I really don't know. You have nothing to eat here. The fridge is empty. Make sure you eat well. Here. Do you know you sometimes come to see me? Showing up without notice... You ask me for money and to treat you to dinner. Smiling brightly... Anyway, she's so funny. Sometimes I get confused which one is my real sister. I hope you become happy again. Sunghee... Yes? I feel as if he were still alive. Slow down. And eat some side dishes. What's wrong? You do nothing but drink lately. It isn't like you. What's like me? What is it? Get some more, will you? Man, I have stuff to deliver. Guchang, look. Isn't that Anni? Late LEE Shihoo The Antarctic? Why was Anni there? The body will come to Korea after 4 days. 3 years ago, he disappeared while he was doing research. He was researching life at the ends of the earth with his partner, But he was wrecked in a blizzard. He wasn't wearing a jacket when the body was found. It's assumed that he died while rescuing a fellow researcher. Yuri... Yuri... Yuri! Hang in there, Yuri. Honey, I'm cold. I can't go any further. You wanted to come here. And I'll go wherever you go. So don't let me lose you. Hang in there... Yuri! Honey, go on. Leave me here. How'd you feel when you watched the news? I was shocked. Do you still think you're to blame for his death? Will you go see his body when it gets here? I'm not sure. You have to. Sterilizing the wound isn't enough when it requires an operation. It's not my will. When she comes out, I disappear. Your will is the most important thing. Anni must've liked you a lot. She often told me about you. How is Anni? It's confusing. Let's call her Yuri, shall we? The girl that I know is Anni. Anni isn't real. Only a substitution character. Don't tell me about a substitution character. Her name is Anni. I know you're confused. I felt the same at first. Do me a favor, Guchang. His body will arrive in 3 days. Doctor says seeing the body will help my sister's psychotherapy. But she won't be able to do so if she turns into Anni. If Anni comes to you, please take her to the airport. What about... Anni? When she's treated, Anni will disappear. Getting rid of Anni is treating her? Why should I help you do that? Yuri was a bright, nice girl. But after that accident, she tried to kill herself 3 times. I love Anni, but... Anni can't exist without Yuri. She should be treated. Please... What happened to your face? I don't know how to drive, and I found myself driving. I thought I was dying. You know what? I feel as if I never existed. My heart evaporating into nothing... You never felt that? They... They treated me like a ghost... Giving me weird looks... But you never did. That's why I like you the best. You're up? I was very surprised last night. Let me look at your face. What the fuck... What's this place? Your room? Why do you come out... Why'd you bring Anni here? No, Anni came here on her own. That bitch... Get me some water. God... Water! With ice in it. What are you staring at? You have a problem? Hey. Hey. Wait. What are you doing? It's payback time. Let me go. Don't make me upset. Disgusting! Getting upset now? Call me names. Fucking asshole! No, No... Guchang, I'm Anni! I'm Anni! You're better than this. God damn it! What the fuck! I'll kill you! Guchang, I'm Anni. Please, help... Please, help... Mother... How could you?! You're an animal! Let's go, Donggu. Come here, come here. Shut up. Stop it. Bye, Mother. You should've stayed for breakfast. I'm okay, Mother. - Come by anytime. - I will. Bye. Buy her something good. Bye. - Bye. - See you. Never seen a girl eat? One who eats 3 portions? Never. Damn... Stop being a pain. Okay? Aren't you scared of disappearing? You're talking like you know something. I met your sister. She told me everything. She says Anni and I are fake and should be erased. How can we? What are we, ghosts? A ghost can't give me a black eye. So... You know I have to go to the airport tomorrow. Yes. Yeah, shit happens. I'm sorry. I've been harsh on you. You bet. So I can't let you go like this. What? Guchang? Here. Come. Sharp left! - Sharp right! To the right! Guchang... Where are we? - It's the ocean! - The ocean! It's the ocean! The ocean! - Sons of bitches! - Run! Hanni is back! Isn't it funny? You grab the sand, put it through your fingers. It's like the time that you can't hold back. What's wrong? You're being philosophical. Your lips look yummy. I won't eat them. Anni is lucky to have you. Stop it. I'll leave. Call Anni. Come on... Go ahead. Call her. Anni? Anni? Did I fall asleep again? Briefly. What if I never wake up? Don't jinx it. The day's breaking soon. Guchang and Anni. What's the relationship between us? You're a cigarette, and I'm an ashtray. Why am I a cigarette? Because I house the trouble that you cause. So if I burn all the way, you'll throw me away? How can an ashtray throw a cigarette? You're right. Thanks for taking me out here. I couldn't be happier. Anything you want, tell me. I'll do it. Really? You promised. I was hoping to see a lighthouse when I came to see the ocean. You can do that for me. Be a lighthouse! - A lighthouse? - Yes. I'm good at making lighthouses. Hold on. I'll make you one. Really? Don't take too long. This is for you! What do you think? It's like a real lighthouse, huh? Yes, it is! Can you go further down? Okay, wait. What about now? Does it look real? Yes, it does! Can you go further down? Okay, hold on. Does it look real now? Yes, it really is. Can you go further down? Okay! Do you like it now, Anni? Do you like it? Anni! Anni! Anni? Anni! Come on, it's not funny. One you told me... It's crazy to sacrifice and dedicate yourself for someone. But you did that for me. Thank you, and I'm sorry. I've received all your love and given you nothing back. Don't be sad. Please smile, thinking about me. Thanks for letting me leave with beautiful memories. Goodbye. What's your name? Anni. How old? Relax and close your eyes. Listen to yourself breathing. When I count to 5, you'll be standing on a snowy field. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Now you see a door. Walk slowly toward it. Where are you Now? In front of the door. Open the door and enter. When you do, you'll be 1 year older. Now you're 21 years old. You approach the door. Open it and enter. How old are you now? I'm 30. You must be tired. Yes. How old are you? 69 Do you see the door? Yes. Open it and enter. How old are you now? Now, it's the last door. Don't enter. When you enter, You'll become weak. Don't enter. Anni is losing her strength. She's too weak to stand. It's getting dark... And nothing is seen. Anni is dying slowly. There... I see a bright light. A light? The ocean. So beautiful. And... A lighthouse is lighting me warmly. It's a very nice lighthouse. That's good. With the most beautiful memory of your life... Your life is coming to an end. Close your eyes again slowly. Now, nothing is seen. Bye, Anni. - Mr. YOON and Ms. LEE? - Yes. - Mr. KIM and Ms. KIM? - Yes. You got it. You go the job! - Sunghee? - Huh? Let's take a break. Okay. There's a cell phone under you bed. Huh? Turn it on. Who is he? I don't know. Why don't you call and find out? Let's go home. Guchang, it's Saturday. Don't you have a date? In a little bit. - Bye. - Bye. Excuse me? Yes? You're a stalker, aren't you? I am not. Don't lie to me. I know you've been watching me. I think you misunderstood. Misunderstood what? What have you been doing here? I've been waiting for my girlfriend. You have a girlfriend? Yes. Come on, be honest. I do have one. She's very nice, pretty, and smiles a lot. She loves rice cake and eats 3 portions of pork. She can fight and protect me from muggers. Isn't she too perfect? Sure, except one thing. What's that? She can't recognize me. Hey! Hey! Why are you running? Why follow me? To give you this! Where'd you get this? Ghost #18 took this phone. Are you kidding me, Guchang? It's true. How'd you know my name? My sister told me. Ah... - Show me respect! - Gosh! I'm older than you. Stop yelling at me! How old are you? Older than you! Can't you remember? You'd beat me up for nothing. You broke my front tooth and hit me with a brick. You must've deserved it. What are you, a thug? What do you want? Pay you for the pain? Sure, it's at least a grand! What the... How'd I hook up with you? You followed me around, okay? You don't know me! How could I not? You like pork, don't you? I like it, so what? And you like rice cake. Yeah, I like it. What, you'll buy me some? I can't buy any, but I have some in my bag. Wanna share it? What the... Why would I? I'll eat it all. Some respect, please! That's how I eat it, too. You taught me that. I taught you stuff like that? You still hear a strange sound? Birds singing? I told you that? If you're so curious, why don't you check it out?
