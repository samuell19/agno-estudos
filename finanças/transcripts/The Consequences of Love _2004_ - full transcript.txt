The worst thing for a man who spends a lot of time alone... ...is lack of imagination. Life, which is already boring and repetitive... ...becomes deadly dull when imagination is missing. Look at this individual with the bow tie. Many would enjoy speculating... ...about his profession and his relationship with these women. I, on the other hand, see only a frivolous man. I am not a frivolous man. The only frivolous thing I possess is my name... ...Titta Di Girolamo. Nothing, sir. - Mr Di Girolamo. - Sir. Good morning. Goodbye. Bye, Sofia. Fancy a game? I'm not up to playing a game... ...I can only solve crosswords. Shame! I get so bored on these business trips. I'm just back from a convention... ...by the seaside in Mexico. Now, instead, I'm here in the cold. Let me introduce myself. Letizia. Di Girolamo. Here on business? Mh. What a life! What's your line? I work for a brokerage company. Really? Which one? Moulinex. You're kidding. As far as I know, they make blenders. Come on! You're not telling the truth. The truth, my friend, is boring. I was wicked and immoral and I ruined your life. You were always honest. That's enough for me. You know what frightens me most? Dying of old age. I don't want to. I want an extraordinary death. You've got to take this now, Carlo. Finished already? I've lost my appetite. What's happening outside? Nothing. You've lost. How much do I owe? Ten Francs. Thank you. When I used to walk in a casino, the world would stand still. They'd whisper: "He's here." "We'll take everything he has." And they did. - It wasn't exactly like that. - Yes, it was. Why else would we live in a hotel room that we once owned? Is "Grabber" a Neapolitan game? I wouldn't know, I'm from Salerno. It's the only card game I know. It's a stupid game. Grabber is a children's game. I learned it as a boy, perhaps that's why I like it. We should never break the ties with our childhood. - Right, sir? - Never! Yes. Well, I mean... Never, we shouldn't. - It takes courage. - To do what? To die an extraordinary death. There is a sect whose members are made up of men and women... ...of all social classes, ages, races and religions. The sect of insomniacs. I'm a member too... and have been for ten years. People who aren't members often say to those who are: ..."If you can't sleep you can read, watch TV..." "...study or do something else." These words are very irritating to members of the insomniac sect. The reason is simple. Insomniacs have one obsession: ...to sleep. The ivory and gold statue from the 18th century. The round Venetian chest in solid walnut. The six Louis XV chairs in waxed wood. The set of sacred scarabs from France. I don't remember that. It was white gold. With emeralds, diamonds and little pearls. - What a shame! - We'll buy everything back one day. Stop it, Carlo! I can't give up hope. You've got to stop cheating at Grabber. I'm getting very good, there's nothing to worry about. Yes, yes... - Goodnight, Carlo. - Goodnight, Isabella. Good morning. - Good morning. - How are you today? - Fine. Did you sleep well? On time as usual. - We're in Switzerland, aren't we? - Mh mh. Is there a problem? One of the hotel guests said to me: ..."That guest of yours, Di Girolamo..." "...it's not true that he's a finance broker." I said: "What do you mean?". He told me: "It's something you should look into." So then I gave him a reply... ...that would have made any hotel manager proud. Want to hear it? I'm listening. I said: ..."Dear sir, Mr Di Girolamo has paid for his room..." "...punctually each month for the last eight years." "He doesn't just pay for the room and full board." "The price of the room includes another service:" "...discretion." That's how I answered. - It was an excellent reply. - It was, wasn't it! Nevertheless... I'm still rather curious. Well... What is your actual profession? You're too intelligent to not realise... ...that every man has an unmentionable secret. Let's do this. You tell me your darkest, most unmentionable secret... ...and I'll tell you mine. You'd make a wonderful poker player. Your face never changes. You're trying to gain time. I stole a pair of skis. Years ago, in the mountains. Outside a shelter. Later on, I was going back up... ...and I caught sight of a chap going down on the ski lift. He was furious. He had boots and snow shoes, but no skis. His face was very unpleasant. I didn't feel guilty at all. Now it's your turn. I was 20. I was in the kitchen with my year-old step brother. I was supposed to check if his food was too hot. I tried it... it was lukewarm. I discovered something else. It was delicious. A great tomato sauce. I greedily ate the lot while he cried in desperation. But I think he survived going hungry that day. - I've really enjoyed myself. - So have I. A famous financier said that when someone knows a secret... ...it isn't a secret anymore. This is my unmentionable secret. And it's not the only one. Respectable society tends to oversimplify drugs... ...dividing the world into addicts and non-addicts. It doesn't take into account the many intermediate stages. Like mine. I've taken heroin once a week for 24 years. Only on Wednesday mornings at ten o'clock sharp. I have never, ever, deviated from this rule. I can't call myself an addict. I can't say I'm alien to drug problems. Once a year I have my blood cleaned thoroughly. It's a costly procedure. How long has Nitto Lo Riccio been on the run? 25, 26 years. I've never met the man who procures my heroin. I've spoken to him on the phone only once. His name is Ludovico. I think it's an unsuitable name for a pusher. Did you reserve this table? Excuse us, but we liked this corner so much. Would you like us to move? I wouldn't know. I've got an idea. This table's big enough for the three of us. - What do you think? - Yes, but I must sit in the corner. Maria, listen to this. Whatever he wants can happen! A fine mess! That's the advantage of using only one's memories to excite oneself. You can own memories... ...you can buy even more beautiful ones. But life is more complicated, human life especially so. A frightening, desperate adventure. Compared to this vice of formal perfectionism... ...cocaine is nothing but a stationmaster's pastime. - Nice! But let us return to Sophie. We became poetic as we admired her being, beautiful and reckless. The rhythm of her life flowed from different springs than ours. Ours can only creep along, envious. This force of happiness, both exacting and sweet... ...that animated her from head to toe, disturbed us. It unsettled us in an enchanting way, but it unsettled us nonetheless. That's the word. If you've got nothing to say, why are we on the phone? I've got a lot to do. - How are the kids? - Fine. - Want to put them on? - I'll see who's here. Dad? - How are you? - Fine. - What are you doing? - Practically nothing. - Good. - What do you mean? I'm doing that too. I'll put Mum on. Thanks for cheering me up. - Titta? - Liliana's become rather witty. - She's sarcastic when she's bored. - Oh, yes? And when she isn't bored? She's unbearable. I've really got to go. - Giulia... - What? Nothing. Bye. - Did you take your lithium? - Not yet. What shall we do for our golden anniversary? Sell the painting of the baroness... ...and take that trip to Cambodia that we've been talking about. We could visit Della Rocca. Never! It's the only thing I've got left of my mother's. - Your materialism revolts me. - Take your lithium. You're just a horrible petit bourgeois. One day you won't find that picture anymore. I'll sell it and go gambling in Monte Carlo. Try it and you'll end up sleeping under a bridge. - I'll divorce you. - I don't want to die here. I want to do something spectacular. Anything. My life was spectacular. The show's over. Get used to it. We're old, we'll die here. If you die first, I'll follow you with a broken heart. And vice versa. Now, please, take your lithium. Mr Di Girolamo. - Mr Di Girolamo! - Yes? May I ask you a question? I'm curious. Go ahead. Why do you want the money to be counted by hand... ...and not by the machine? We must never lose faith in our fellow men. The day that happens will be a bad day. - FUTURE PLANS: NOT TO UNDERESTIMATE... - ...THE CONSEQUENCES OF LOVE - Hi! - It's your brother, sir. - Put him on. No, he's here in person. Big brother! - Looking good! - I can't stand my face being touched. - Sorry. - What am I supposed to say? - Anything. - Make something up, if you want. - I've not got much imagination. Fuck, it's no joke talking to you. I'm always alone. I'm not used to talking. So take advantage of me. When did you say you're leaving? - Already pissed off? - I was making conversation. I'm going to the Maldives tomorrow. They need a surf instructor at a resort for 3 weeks. - How's Dad? - He's dead, but doesn't know it yet. - He'll live for forever. - You never call him. Why should I? To hear him tell me I'm a criminal? - You've been unlucky, that's all. - Bad luck doesn't exist. It's an invention of losers. And the poor. Anyway he's not doing too well. He'd like to go back to Salerno, he says Rome's not for him. - But mum doesn't want to move. - I always liked your mother. Thanks. You're beautiful, you know? I'm going to the Maldives. Why don't you come too? I don't look good in swimsuits. Good answer. When they do that, it usually means they're up for it. Have you got a girlfriend? I get it. You haven't. Remember Dino Giuffr?, our neighbour? Of course I do. - You were friends as kids, weren't you? - He's my best friend. - You still see him? - No, and I've not spoken to him in 20 years. - It's a bit tough to describe him as your best friend then. - But he is. I get it, your imaginary friend. You tell him all the things you don't tell me, in your head. Dino Giuffr? is my best friend, full stop. If we were friends once, we're friends for life. What bullshit! Anyway... ...I met his sister last week. - Mh. - Know what she told me? - Mh. He doesn't live in Salerno anymore. He works for the electric company. He repairs power lines in the mountains up north. When there's a power cut... ...he climbs up and fixes it. At night too, when it's cold and windy. - So? - Isn't that a lousy job? - It's just a job like any other. - No, it's not. His life is really shitty. Want to compare it to being a surf instructor? - In the Caribbean? - You were always a superficial man. You're not even a man. You're just a boy. - Goodbye, everyone. - Goodbye. - Bye, dear. Goodbye. I've worked here for two years... ...and I greet you every day. You never answer. Have you, by any chance, realised I exist? Hello? Titta, is that you? You should be more polite to that girl. She's a nice girl. She's got her problems too. Like me, like you, like everyone. You think you're the only one with problems? - Well, are you pleased I came? - Very. Liar! You were always a big liar. Perhaps sitting at this bar... ...is the most dangerous thing I've done in my life. Are you Di Girolamo? Have I done something wrong? Maybe I made a mistake... ...and didn't realise it? Well? Have you come for me? I'd like to know. Don't flatter yourself, Di Girolamo. We've travelled 1,500 km and we're tired. What do you mean? You've already asked four questions... ...and in our business one's already too much. This isn't a quiz show and I'm not your contestant. So... be a good boy and calm down. It's him. Martusciello. The television doesn't work. What the fuck do you do without TV? Ask who it is first. Who is it? Me. - How did it go? - Well. Complications? I got hungry at one point. Expecting someone? Now you don't have to ask who it is. Don't worry, it's my bag. Niccol, have you figured out where all our work ends up? In there. Let's go. Is one of your boyfriends picking you up today? What boyfriends? The ones that wait outside when you finish work. They're not boyfriends, they're driving instructors. I take lessons after work. - I'm getting my license. - Ah. That's why you sit in the driver's seat. I wouldn't have expected you to notice all these things. Shy people notice everything but they don't get noticed. They notice everything or just me? The lift to the garage. - Last one! - Last one! We've got a problem. The accounts don't balance. There's 100,000 dollars missing. Could we do a recount using the machine? What do you think? Put all the money back into the bag immediately. Don't say that. It's surely our mistake. There's obviously a lack of trust between you and I. Put the money in the bag. Arrange for my account to be closed immediately. Let's not rush into things, we'll sort this out. Sir? We could do this: ...we'll recount the money. If we reach the same conclusion... ...the bank will compensate the missing 100,000 dollars. What do you think? I'd be less offended if you killed my mother. You're suggesting... ...I accept a charity donation from your bank? Losing at Grabber to a cheating amateur doesn't mean... ...one isn't capable of carrying out a major bluff. To achieve good results, the bluff must be followed through. To an utmost degree. There's no compromise. You can't bluff half-way and then tell the truth. You've got to be ready to run the risk... ...of looking ridiculous. I'm just waiting for you to put the money back in the bag. Sir, we didn't notice there were... ...4 more bundles of 25,000 in the bag. We must never lose faith in our fellow men. It was a bad day for you today. Have the money taken to the vault. How do they look? I get it, you prefer the ones I tried before. - Here you are. - Thanks. What does that mean? It means I've stopped losing. By the way, I've got something to show you. I've got something to show you too. It's lovely. How much does a toy like this cost? - 100,000 dollars. - You made a smart move. It'll make you a bit younger. - It's not mine, it's yours. - You're kidding? I've already got a car. I can't accept a gift like this. That's what people always say. You don't get it. To accept this would alter our relationship entirely. I want to alter our relationship entirely. You want to buy me? You can't give a car like this to someone you don't know. - I do know you. - Do you? What do you know about me? Let's hear it. What do you want from me? Stop giving me this mute performance. It doesn't always work. You've got to say something. - Talk! - What must I say? What can I say in these situations? I'm a business consultant. I'll never accept this car. Why? Why? I wanted to see where you live. - Do you like my room? - It's a room. It's my room. Could you switch on the light? Why did you come? I felt guilty. You felt needed... ...that's why you came. But I don't need anybody. In order to accept a gift, I have to know who it's from. My name's Titta. Di Girolamo. For 24 years... ...every Wednesday morning at 10... ...I habitually use heroin. I've never made an exception, except for tonight. I was a business consultant ten years ago. A business consultant... I was someone on the stock exchange. I negotiated the purchase of an oil tanker. It's not easy to negotiate an oil tanker purchase. I invested billions. I invested for the Mafia too. I invested 250 billion for them, and lost 220 in two hours. They realised I hadn't stolen it. They pardoned me. They shut me up here... ...in this hotel. Once a week... ...I take a bag containing several million dollars to a bank. But I'm not affiliated with the Mafia. I've got a gun, but I've never used it. I suffer from insomnia. I separated from my wife ten years ago. I've got three kids and I call them often... ...but they don't want to talk to me. I'll be 50 tomorrow. It's my birthday. And I don't feel tired. Tomorrow we'll go out of town to celebrate your birthday. To the mountains. I'll pick you up in my car at three. Now get some sleep, you're tired. If you look me in the face, I'll shoot you. Well done. Now you've got to tell me a couple of things. Where are the car keys... ...and what's the code for the alarm? The keys are in the top drawer of the desk. The code is 2250. Good. When we've gone, call Pippo D'Ant... ...and try and convince him it wasn't you. - Pippo, it's Di Girolamo. - What can I do for you? - They took the bag. - What the fuck are you saying? - The two Sicilians who were here a few days ago. - Are you crazy? They're my cousins. They came in and saw another bag arrive. - Don't talk crap. You've got to come here. - What for? To convince Nitto that it wasn't you. Me? What've I got to do with it? Explain that to Nitto. Ni... Nitto Lo Riccio? Well done, you turd. Name names. If you want to save your neck, come and explain to Nitto. I've got an appointment, I'll come in two days time. You haven't got a hope in hell... ...if you don't come right away. - I'll come in two days. But today isn't the first of the month. I've never been loved by anyone. It's Di Girolamo. I'm leaving today at 6:30 p.m. - We'll get you at the airport. - Fine. How will I recognize you? I haven't seen you in 15 years. I haven't changed. This is for you. It should add up to what you lost in the last few months. I had to sell something of my mother's. I want to say something else. There was no need to humiliate my husband that way. He's an old man. You could have just stopped playing. You're an evil person. Goodbye. - Did someone come for me? - No, sir. Messages? None. Pippo... It's Di Girolamo. I didn't recognize you. - Where are we going? - We're already here. What the fuck are you laughing at, Di Girolamo? - Nothing. Just thinking. - What about? That I can't break free of hotels, isn't it ridiculous? Ridiculous? It's ridiculous... ...that you lost a bag containing 9 million dollars. That's ridiculous. He's here. Tell me in a concise statement what happened. Well... Two people came into the room. They held me at gunpoint and took the bag. But first they asked for the keys to my car... ...and the code for the alarm. I gave them both to them. Then one of them said: ..."Now call Pippo D'Ant and try to convince him it wasn't you..." "...if you can." I was scared, then I thought about it. I called Pippo. I explained the facts. He told me to come here immediately and explain. He also said it wouldn't be easy to convince you it wasn't me. I got even more scared. Then I thought about it. I thought I had to get the bag back right away. And that's what I did. And now I have it. So why did you come all the way here? You could've just gone to the bank, deposited the money... ...and telephoned us to say everything was okay. It was just a hitch. There's another hitch. That's why I came. What hitch? I don't want to give you the bag. As you've already understood, Di Girolamo's account... ...must be transferred to someone else. Do we need Di Girolamo for that? Give me a telephone and I'll talk to the Swiss. Fine. Fine. Let's get back to us. Why don't you want to give us the bag? You stole my life from me... ...so I'm stealing your bag. I see. But if there's no bag, there's no life. I know. You'll tell us where you left the bag. No. I don't think so. You know why? Because you're a good man. And because we're more intelligent than you. That's true, I was never very... ...intelligent. What restaurant did you book for tonight? - At Restelli's. - Good! Their food's good. You need passion,... ...lots of patience, .. ...raspberry syrup... ...And a touch of recklessness. You need a pound of.. ...your own ability,... ...Latin sensuality and a little distance. That's how you make it, lipstick and chocolate... ...and not to eat them would be a shame. That's how you do it, over low heat,... ...Stirring, with lots of feeling. Bloody hell! I'll be there in two days. - You know, Nitto's fond of you. - What? Nitto's fond of you. When he found out about the missing 100,000 dollars... ...he pretended it was nothing. And he even believed you when you told that story... ...about the two that took the bag. And how do you pay him back? - You're hostile with him. - He believed me? Sure. If he hadn't believed you... ...Pippo would still be here with us now. For a while, Pippo was looking for his... ...independence. Now he's independent. But Nitto can't pretend nothing's happened... ...over 9 million dollars. You understand that? Tell us where that fucking bag is... ...and you can start a new life. The whole Committee has troubled themselves for you. This honour should make you talk. But instead you... Anyway... This is how it works. The crane lowers you down. When you start to talk, it stops. Otherwise it doesn't stop. Only one thing's certain. I know it. Every now and then, at the top of an electric pylon... ...in the midst of a snowy landscape, against a cold, biting wind... ...Dino Giuffr? stops. Sadness descends upon him... ...and he starts to think. And thinks that I, Titta Di Girolamo... ...am his best friend.
