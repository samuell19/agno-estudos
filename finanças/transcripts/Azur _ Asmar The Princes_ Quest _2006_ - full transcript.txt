Azur... Asmar... Nurse. Nuss. Nurse, say more sweet words. But a handsome prince will come, bearing the three magic keys. He will deliver the Djinn Fairy and he will find love. What are djinns? They're little people who look after the world around us. Sometimes they are kind, sometimes they are wicked. It's best for the Djinn Fairy to see to them. Are there djinns here too? Yes, but they're known as elves. Perhaps some kind ones will come to soothe your sleep tonight. Sleep well, my children. Good night, nurse. The little child... will grow one day. He will cross the oceans. He will deliver the Djinn Fairy. And both of them will live happily. How is my son? Growing big and growing up. He has the eyes of an angel. Be sure he lacks nothing. Yes, master. Across the sea, in the land of the Djinn Fairy, the sun shines all the time. The scent of roses and jasmine fills the air. The houses are white and blue, as in a dream. His slice is bigger! No, I have less! He's eaten it all! Stop or I won't tell you about the Djinn Fairy. No! What do you say? Thank you, nurse. But the Djinn Fairy is held captive far away in a black mountain. Inside it, there's a Hall of Light decorated with precious stones. And, within a crystal cage, the Djinn Fairy is held prisoner, more beautiful than any diamond! One day, a loving prince will come. He will find the three magic keys. He will defeat the Scarlet Lion with its blue claws. He will defeat the bird Simourh with its rainbow wings. He will find the secret passageway in the Black Cliff. Azur has grown. He shouldn't be with you now. From now on, he will sleep in his room upstairs. You're not handsome. I am, I'm the handsome one. Your clothes are, but you aren't. But I have blue eyes. They're ugly. I look like an angel. You? An angel! My country's better. You don't know! You've never been. But my mum said so. She never said that! She did! She didn't! - She did! - She didn't! The rain's stopped! Your country is this one. You were born here. It's not my country! It is! Stop that! Which one's Azur? Enough! From now on, you'll learn dancing, fencing, riding and Latin. Don't let me down. I'm sorry? God willing. One, two, three, four... More nobility in your bearing. Nobility, I said, not a stiff neck. Bring some grace to what you do. I asked for grace, not for mush. We'll stop there for today. A bow... Take your time. You can go. You looked like a duck. You don't even have a dad! You don't have a mum! Yes, but your mum is mine too now. No! My mum isn't yours! She is, she's mine too! You rat! Good for nothing! Stop that! Azur, go to your room. You'll go to bed without supper. Thanks, that's enough. I'll only get the runs after. Straighten up. Try to be worthy of your mount. Trot now, please. The horse disobeyed! You won't improve by accusing others. If the horse is bad, it's never the horse's fault but the rider's. Repeat. If the horse is bad, it's never the horse's fault but the rider's. When I grow up, I'll travel across the sea to deliver the Djinn Fairy and marry her. No, I'll marry her! You have no right! Yes, I do! Anyway, I'm the stronger of us two! That's not true! I'll show you! Scum! Stop that! In the dung now! This has to end. Azur, I have a surprise for you. This is your new tutor. Good day, sir. Follow me, please. You stay here! Get in. You're off to study in the city. You'll live at your tutor's. Your trunk is on board. Goodbye, my son. Study hard. And avoid bad company. I need to wash. You'll have time. Let me say goodbye to my nurse. You have nothing to say to that woman! I don't want to leave! Let go of me! You have no right! I no longer need you. Leave. What? Do you understand? You're no longer needed. You're dismissed. Where will I go with my son? None of my business. Where's Azur? None of your business. He left in a carriage. Without saying goodbye? He had better to do. Get out! I have to pack... No, everything here is mine. You'll leave with the clothes you're in, no more. Be gone, before I get angry! Azur, you're a man now. What will you do? I want to go to the land across the sea and deliver the Djinn Fairy. You're joking? No. That Saracen's venom is in your veins. I shouldn't have hired her. Nor hounded her away! Your disrespect should be punished. Stop punishing me. Help me. Haven't I done that? Whatever the obstacles, I shall travel to the land across the sea. I'm going to the land of my dreams to find love! I've lost everything. I don't know where I am. What a depressing place. My nurse's language! I'm there! The poor men... lt's my nurse's language... but I don't understand it. lt's been too long. And my nurse spoke more slowly. But l must go over. Be brave! What did l say? No more blunders this time. l won't say anything. Why? Tell me! I know, blue eyes. So what? Cursed? The evil eye? My blue eyes mean bad luck? What's that stench? l'm as hungry as this dog. Do dogs see that l have blue eyes too? This country smells bad. The people are crippled. They're malicious. They're ugly, the houses are ugly and the countryside's ugly. l believed in the Djinn Fairy. My nurse lied. I should have drowned. People are coming! Don't let them see me. They've seen me! They're going to hit me. They're not going to hurt me. Yes, but my eyes are closed. They don't know they're blue. They'll never know. This world is ugly. l'll never open my eyes again. From now on, I'm blind. The city? To beg? You're not from around here. - Neither are you. - True. We must stick together against the locals. I have trouble walking but you're brisk. I can see well, you see nothing. I speak this country's language well, you speak it badly. If you carry me on your shoulders, I'll guide you and speak for you. Heaven must have sent you! I could no longer bear being alone in this foul land. Climb on. Forward march! I'm Crapoux. And you? Azur. Odd name. What do you look like? Like you. Tall, with fair hair... What colour are your eyes? Dark. I wouldn't be here if they were blue! The locals are convinced that blue-eyed people are cursed and bring bad luck! Incredible. I swear! The locals are superstitious to the core! Turn back! Hurry! What's wrong? A black cat to the left. It's bad luck. Isn't that superstition? It's been proved! We believe it at home. Not in my home. You're heading for a palm. What's a palm? It's a local tree. It's as ugly as all the rest. They don't have pines here! What's that sound? A gazelle. Its legs are too long. They don't have rabbits! What's that? An irrigation canal. They have to bring water in pipes. They don't have rain! What are you doing in this lost land anyway? I was shipwrecked and washed up here. You know the language a little. How come? My nurse came from here. I was very close to her as a child. Is she dead? Yes. My father threw her out, with her son. They vanished. Then we heard that wolves had devoured them. Why were they in our country? Why are you here? You won't believe me... Twenty years ago, I came here to deliver and marry a Djinn Fairy. What? The stupid things young men do. I believed every word. She doesn't exist? She does. But I thought the natives would let me try. My foot! They kept foiling me. Without them, I'd have found the secret passages and the Djinn Fairy. We're near the Chapel of the Hot Key. A magic key? Guide me. I want to see... to touch it. You fool, there's nothing to see or touch. You're there. It's odd... It's not, it's tiling. They don't have whitewash! Watch your step! The ground's full of holes. Why? These chapels are empty so those looking for the Djinn Fairy dig up the floor hoping to find a hiding place. But a hot key makes no sense. The Hot Key exists and I know where it is. What? Are you out of your mind? It's warm. How did you find it? I just had to touch the wall. Among the cold tiles, one was hot. Hand it over! We'll get a good price. I don't want to sell it. I'm happy to have it. We've reached the city. What's that? Some old gobbledygook. They don't have tunes! Come on, move! Dirhams! They don't have pistoles! Look out, a donkey! Turn. The guards keep us away. From what? Princess Chamsous-Sabah's palace. What's she like? They say she's intelligent. But no one's ever seen her. Why? Princesses are shut up indoors here. She's probably as ugly as sin, like the other girls here. What a smell! It stinks! We're in the dyer's souk. It's full of hanks of wool. Blue, yellow, red... They don't have grey! What's that? The muezzin, calling them to prayer. They don't have bells! Move! Get out of the way! You nearly got us hit by some scrawny nag. They don't have draught horses! Some kind of musicians banging bits of metal. They don't have bagpipes! You don't need to shout. I'm not shouting! They don't understand anyway! Have some. What is it? Couscous. A dish with wheat and lamb. They don't have stew! We have a lot now. We'll share it evenly. Here. Thank you. I smell something. Of course you do. It's the spice market. They use them in everything! They don't have mustard! You have all the white peppers and all the black peppers. I'm guiding him! We're by a stall selling ginger and nutmeg. It's further on. There's also cinnamon, cumin, dried rose buds, fennel... Coriander, saffron, aniseed, bay leaves, sesame seeds, cloves, cardamom... This is it. Another chapel. The Chapel of the Scented Key, they call it. Don't bother. No one has ever smelled anything here. There are no tiles and the ground's been dug up too. Could you get down a while? I'm worn out. Are you crazy? Come back down! You're blind! Wait to be guided! When I'm not guided, I find things. You've got us into trouble without finding anything. That smells good. We'll sell this one! We can get a good price! You don't need it! Who can say... Surely you don't think you can win the Djinn Fairy? I'm starting to wonder. Don't get offended, but, remember, you're blind. Don't get offended, but, remember, I've found two magic keys. Pure luck. You're a bit of a fool. I'm not the fool you think I am. You are! After all, I should know. You mean the fact you don't limp and you kept four coins? You can see? No, but I can hear. You initially ran up to me, at a steady pace too. As for the coins, I count them as they fall into the bowl. Why didn't you say? I can't. My nurse taught me to be polite. You don't call people liars and thieves. Even if it's true? And I called you a fool... Here. Thank you. There's one missing. I know that voice! What voice? They all yell! This way... Wait for me and stop causing trouble! Here. This is it! I know that voice. I doubt it. You know no one here. It's my nurse's voice! You're mad! Widow Jenane is the richest merchant here. That's my nurse! Knock and ask. I'm not mad. They don't like foreigners. The servants keep people out. Your nurse is dead. If she escaped, she'll forget you or reject you as you all rejected her. That's possible. But I must try. I must speak to this woman. Go. Ask her. Explain. If it works, you'll have money. A lot of money. All right. Just for you then. Happy now? Nurse! You'll get us beaten! It's Azur! Remember! Let me in! Why are you making all this fuss outside my home? Nurse... I'm Azur. I don't know how you know about him, but such deception will lead you nowhere. You're not that boy who is no longer part of my life. Please leave. Nurse, I'm Azur. Azur is on the other side of the sea. Nurse, I've crossed that sea. Azur didn't have your voice. Nurse, a boy's voice changes. Azur... wasn't blind. Azur! My son! It worked. Azur dear, you've grown so handsome. You are beautiful too. Before, I was blind and, before that, I saw only ugliness. And here you are, as beautiful as a queen! I'm feasting my eyes. Your beautiful blue eyes. Nurse, doesn't it bother you to have me in your home with my pale eyes? You mean the superstition about blue eyes? Listen, my son. I know two lands, two languages and two religions, meaning I know twice as much as others. While others stop because of blue eyes or black cats, I keep moving and I win! Never mention that silliness about blue eyes to me again! You pathetic fool! If blue eyes bother you, leave and don't come back! And tell the others that. Go! Did she understand? With the tone I used, the language doesn't matter. Nurse... Could you give me food? It's been so long... My son is hungry and I don't think to feed him! My son from across the sea has returned! Come and see my garden. You're here, all of a sudden. As tall and handsome as a prince! I can barely believe it. How did you come all this way, Azur? You've no idea what happened to us. Life can be so surprising. We have so much to talk about. Where can we start? My head's spinning. My Azur's here. What a joy! Eat, my child. Thank you. Nurse... Yes, my child. What about Asmar? Asmar! He has grown tall and handsome like you. You're in time to see him. Tomorrow, he is leaving to deliver the Djinn Fairy. Such madness doesn't delight me. But she's all he thinks about. But you can keep me company now. I want to go too! What? How stupid I am! Of course you want to go. You always wanted the same things. That's him. My joy is complete. He's not a vagabond. This is Azur, your brother! His beautiful land isn't a foul land and his blue eyes have never harmed us. Azur is now our guest and his presence honours us. He greeted you. Asmar has never shamed me before. He hasn't forgiven the harm we were done across the sea. I understand. But not everyone hurt us. You certainly didn't! You want to seek the Djinn Fairy too? Yes. I always gave you identical slices of cake. I'll finance your expedition just as I'm financing Asmar's. But you won't know where to go. You lack the information that Asmar has gathered. No, not now! I promised him a reward if he got me in here. He'll have it. Could you let him in? He accompanied me and helped me. I know him. He lied to you, robbed you and insulted the land that shelters him so your life will fail like his! He helped me anyway. He too wanted to deliver and marry the Djinn Fairy. Him and the Djinn Fairy! But since you ask, he may come in. I wonder what he's like. Are you Crapoux? Yes. - This isn't how I saw you. - You can see? And you have blue eyes? If you don't like blue eyes, you can leave now! I don't mind them. Thank you, Madame Jenane. Can you keep a secret? Yes. How long have you been hiding like this? Twenty years. The servants have accepted my blue eyes. Take off your glasses. I can't. You're a rich kid now, safe within a palace. But I'm a tramp who depends on the man in the street. The news would reach the whole city in no time. I can shelter you. I don't want that. Even if I do it down, I like my city. People scorn me and mistreat me but I reassure and amuse them. They give me what I need to live with them. But if you pay me well, I can help Azur. Tell me how. I can teach him about the Djinn Fairy and guide him to her. Who says the Djinn Fairy interests me that much? I'm not the fool you think I am. Who's to say you won't use that to try to win her for yourself? I'm no longer rising up to meet the Djinn Fairy. Azur is. He is the pure flame. But I can still help him with what I've learned on my quest. My life won't be a failure if Azur wins. Nurse, let Crapoux be my squire. You trust him? Yes. Your eyes closed? You're the same size. You know that suits you? We have no time for this. He needs a hood to hide his eyes. Stand up. Three people can tell Azur everything. First, Crapoux. That's done. But not over yet. Then the wise man Yadoa. Excellent choice. I often seek his advice too. I know him well, so that's easy. And, finally, Princess Chamsous-Sabah. How can we get to her? She has the secrets. No problem. I'll send her a message. You frequent the princess? Yes. Lower your head. We talk about foreign trade. Everything interests her. Princess Chamsous-Sabah is both intelligent and pretty. May God preserve her, she is the future of this land. You're as blind as before with your eyes lowered. I see interesting things. Their shoes are odd. They're ridiculous. Babouches. They don't have clogs! Crapoux, stop it. I really did have a bad foot but the wise man Yadoa cured me. He's a great doctor as well. The country's lucky to have him. Welcome, Azur, son of Jenane. You speak my language! Yes, we're from the same land. Why did you leave? My great-great-grandfather was born far away and people called me a foreigner and tormented me, so I sought refuge here. But aren't you a foreigner here too? Yes, but I'm not tormented. I continue my research and I teach Greek and Hebrew to Princess Chamsous-Sabah. God preserve her, she's the future of this country. You must cross the Mountain of Ancient Cities. But where? I know! Wonderful! You must beware of other contenders who will try to kill you, of bandits, of slave-hunters, and of the Scarlet Lion and the bird Simourh who have devoured many a contender. Yes, my nurse mentioned them. You must carry meat with you, hoping that it will suffice. You must find the Black Cliff, whose entrances cannot be seen. There are cracks within it. If you manage to find one, you will enter an underground world full of pitfalls but one that contains the Duplicate Doors, the last ones before the Fairy. One leads to the Cave of Shadows, meaning you lose. The other leads to the Hall of Light, meaning you save and win the Fairy. Which is the right door? No one knows. They say everyone chooses the Door of Shadows anyway. Yes, I've heard that too. Perhaps Princess Chamsous-Sabah... Time to go to the palace. Will she understand me? Yes, ever since her birth, the princess has had the best tutors from around the world and she speaks several languages. Good day, sir. What beautiful eyes you have! Good day, Your Highness. My eyes' colour doesn't bother you? Because they're blue? I'm too big for such childishness. Does it bother you that I'm not old? No! The men of my family are dead. They were all poisoned or killed in battle, either by enemies or by each other. That's sad. Yes, it's sad. But one mustn't be or it never ends. We must live now and be useful. Since I'm a girl, no one thinks of killing me. That's handy. My mother teaches me what she knows and has the rest taught to me. Perhaps your enemies will realize... It will be too late. I'll be stronger and I'll have them killed. Now then, we need to deliver the Djinn Fairy for we need her here. This bottle contains the Fog of Invisibility. Thank you, Highness. Can I help you? I'm strong enough, thank you. This is Feline Tongue, a sweet that lets you talk to lions. Thank you, Highness. This is an iridescent feather from the Simourh to prevent him from devouring you. You're wondering where we are? Yes... This is the wise man Yadoa's observatory. But we're underground. We can't see the stars. Use that handle there. Those trinkets may be useful but beware. The fog lifts, the sweet melts and the feather flies off. Your courage at all times is what matters most. It's between you and Asmar. You've seen Asmar too? Of course. I gave him the same knick-knacks as you. I have none left. But I sense that one of you will deliver the Djinn Fairy. I don't know which one. The loser will help me. I'll help you even if I win. Asmar said the same thing. The drought will soon end, young men will stop killing and princesses will no longer be locked up in palaces. Close the roof. Wise man Yadoa says we mustn't leave them in the sun. They say whatever happens, we choose the Door of Shadows. People do say that. I don't know what it means. When you reach the Duplicate Doors, use your brain and your heart. Yes, they're your clothes. How old are you? My work brings you fine clothes. You can lend some to your poor brother. You'll leave to find the Fairy together. You'll be going into the mountains. Four are stronger against robbers. You'll part when the time comes. Where are you going? To explore the city. You should sleep! You're leaving at dawn! I have to see the city before leaving. Take someone with you. You're hiding something. Nurse, don't be afraid, I'm up to no harm. I'm not afraid you'll do any harm, I'm afraid you'll be harmed. I'm outside! I'm in the street! I know everything from my library, but I know nothing real. What's on the ground? There's nothing, just earth. Real earth everywhere? That's amazing! The palace has tiles everywhere. Do you think I can touch it? Of course! Is that a cat? Yes, it is. The palace has none? Of course not. They'd bite me and scratch me. What an idea! Stroke it. A tree! Is it real? Of course. The palace's plants are in pots. Can we go closer? Of course. Are there djinns in the tree? No, those are fireflies. I was wise to open my eyes. My city is sleeping. Look, the palace stands out. I prefer it from the outside. That's the mosque next to it, with the church and the synagogue. There, in the booksellers' souk, the madrassa where people study. Someone's still working. Then the maristane where the sick are cared for. You can see the fondouk where travellers stay. This the home of bad Ouard, a merchant. He hates Jenane because she's a woman and more powerful. Quick, we must run! Not the palace! You can't climb back in now! Jenane's house! If the door's locked, we've had it! Princess Chamsous-Sabah! I was so scared! What is this madness? We wanted to see the city. We overheard the bad Ouard and his men getting ready to follow Asmar and his foreign brother to the Djinn Fairy... To kill us and take our place. Let's do things in order. First, the princess returns to the palace. Not with those men outside. I can sleep here! Out of the question! You must return to the palace at all costs and no one must know that you left it or you will be punished and we shall all be executed. Asmar, you can't understand. You've never been blind, nor a princess. I hope no one will ever know what we have done with the princess. While you sneak out, I'll confuse them with a fake princess. Good idea. Thank you. Asmar is back. Ouard and his men know you know. They'll hide better and be more numerous but won't give in. We know. We'll lead them in the wrong direction. Don't forget this. All right. Here, these are pastries. They can do you good. You have your sheepskin coats? What's that? Carrier pigeons. To tell me how it's going. But, nurse, we're seeking the Djinn Fairy! We can't write letters! I'm simply asking you to free one bird each day, so I'll know you're alive. I wonder if... He wanted to be alone. Too bad! One less contender. No! No, it's just a scratch. I bet he knows a short cut. Let's follow from afar. No, I'm not Ouard. Never mind. My path's the best anyway. They're in trouble. A bloodstain! I have no idea! Their blood's the same colour! This piece of meat is too heavy. You already said that. The meat will be vital if we find the Scarlet Lion or the Simourh. Don't tempt fate! The Scarlet Lion! Run! No, we're getting close! Yes, close to the lion. Let's leave. We're nearing our goal. Not at all. And if the Scarlet Lion gobbles us up, you'll never deliver the Fairy. I have this meat, "Feline Tongue" and the Simourh's feather. I can manage. You've guided me and saved my life. Thank you, Crapoux. I'll carry on. No, forget it. No one has ever done it. There are other Fairies. Come along. I've grown used to you. Don't go dying now. Crapoux, we know of the obstacles and they increase my determination. It's natural that we should part now. You're right. Goodbye. Good luck! Slay the Lion with your sword while he eats the meat. Azur! Above you! Asmar? You speak my language? Of course. It's mine too. I learnt it with you! Don't talk, they'll hurt you. No, they can't harm me, if they want to sell me! It didn't take you long to become slaves. They want you as a slave but they kill anyone with blue eyes! Bravo! The sun behind you... is a secret door! Press on... Press on what? The chin! You're mad. It could be a trap. I know. Let's hope they don't find out how to get in. No risk of that. All they can do is hammer with their swords... until they break. Don't bother. It's no use. That's how it goes, Azur. We couldn't both win. Yes, it's not just a scratch. You're hurting me needlessly. Go now. You're nearly there. Others are coming. I want you to be the one to win. What are you doing? There's no doctor here. It's too late for one. The third door. The only one the bats use. What's wrong? The bridge is out. Can you jump it? Not with you. Without me. Put me down, Azur. We have no choice. Don't give in. I'm not giving in. The heat! It's unbearable! We'll have to turn back. The Door of Fire. We're getting close, Asmar. I have what we need. The Hot Key. What a stench! It's unbearable! The Door of Gasses. Quick, the Scented Key! What a din! It hurts my ears! The Door of Iron... I don't have the key! I don't have the keys to turn back, nor the key to keep going. I have it. In my left boot. The Cutting Key. The Duplicate Doors! We're there! Soon the Hall of Light! Or the Cave of Shadows... We must choose. The right one. Why? They say left is bad. That makes no sense. It's like blue eyes. I'd be surprised if one could win the Fairy with such silliness. The left door then? I don't know. I think... that I am dying. Hang on, Asmar. We'll enter the Hall of Light, with a thousand torches reflected in its tiles as in a mirror! Asmar, the Djinn Fairy will be there, more beautiful than any diamond! The Cave of Shadows! All is lost! You have won. The Djinn Fairy. You're the victorious prince who has delivered me. Welcome to your realm, handsome prince. Welcome to your realm. Farewell, my brother. No! My brother won! He sacrificed himself for me! He's here. He found the last key and the last passageway! And he's dying! Save him! Hurry! I'm alive. It's so beautiful... What luck! It was the right door. It didn't matter. Both doors lead to this hall. I gave the Light Djinns orders. I left the other princes in the dark. They didn't interest me. Yet you were here, Djinn Fairy, within reach, so beautiful... I'm not presentable. I'm the more handsome. Careful! He's wounded! I'm the more handsome. I am! You're both magnificent. Which one delivered me? He did! You must decide. It was you. No, you! Here we are, like when we were boys. Only one person could stop us. Our mother! But she's far away. My sons! Good day, madam. We have brought you to judge which of the two princes, your sons, delivered us. Madam Fairy, I must confess... I'm a simple merchant and my sons aren't princes. I know their behaviour. They are princes as we understand it. What happened? Azur has kept saving my life. I'd be dead without Asmar's sacrifice! You're both so wonderful! How could I choose between you? Madam Fairy, I can't say which is the more deserving. But I know a quick-witted person who will not share my scruples. We'll fetch that person. It's Princess Chamsous-Sabah. One, two... Bow. Set off again. With the proper foot, please! For pity's sake... Help! The princess has been taken! It's so beautiful here. You're so handsome. Jenane! I'm so happy! Madam Fairy! I'm delighted to see you delivered. We're going to do good work together. Who will you marry? I don't know. We're counting on you to tell us. I'll explain. Up in the mountains, Asmar... ...and I wouldn't be here if Azur hadn't saved me. What do you advise, Your Highness? It's simple. If I were you, I'd marry them both. That wouldn't do. I don't know then. But someone knows more than I do. Welcome, wise man Yadoa. We need your wisdom. This is what happened. Azur and Asmar were each coming here... Now you know everything. Alas, Madame Fairy, that is far from true. And in spite of my all my wisdom, I cannot determine which young man is the more deserving. But the six of us must find the answer. We're too similar to each other. I know a seventh person who thinks differently. You're alive! The whole family's here! Good day, madam. Good day, Mr Asmar. My respects, master. Hi, little girl. Crapoux, this is Princess Chamsous-Sabah! Sorry. My respects, Your Highness! Hello, Crapoux. The Djinn Fairy... Fairy... I have dreamt of you so much. Thank you, sir. But... fate has decided otherwise. So... Who is the lucky winner? We're counting on you to say. Easy! Which one arrived first? They arrived together. But that's not how you should have done it! But it's what they did. Forget that. It's a classic dilemma. Since no one can choose between the two, the answer is a third fellow. They're both very pretty but they're poor conversationalists. Your humble servant, however... Thank you! We must choose one of the princes who overcame the ordeals or the curse will return. We must settle this. My cousin, the Elf Fairy, gives sound advice. Welcome, dear cousin. Yes, I have been delivered at last. Tell us which prince has won. I listened to your message while crossing the sea and, like all of you, I cannot reply. But there's no hurry. Let's take the time to enjoy each other's company and get better acquainted. I am sure that our gathering will conclude happily. The answer is becoming obvious. It seems to be deliberate. Let's all dance! It's easy, just follow me. Invite your partner. A pavane for our friends, please. One, two, three, four... The proper foot! Don't look at your feet. Hold your heads up. Not too stiff. With elevation. But facility. Turn. Sir, let there be no misunderstanding between us. I find you gifted with every quality and worthy of inspiring love. But your brother Asmar... fascinates me. Bow. Turn. My brother, I inform you that the Elf Fairy prefers you. My brother, I inform you that the Djinn Fairy prefers you. I can't say I'm sorry. Neither can I. It's even better this way. Yes, it's the answer for the future. I myself am free and ready to enter such a union with a forceful woman.
