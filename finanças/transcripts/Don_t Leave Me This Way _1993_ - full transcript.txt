-[water surges] -[haunting music] [door clunks] In a way, the journey really began five years ago when I joined woman's group in Camden. If you told me then that I was going to embark on an adventure like this on my own, and even more amazing write a book about it, I'd have said you were absolutely mad. [chuckling] People keep asking me if I've emerged wiser or stronger, if it's been a life-changing experience? Well, I can't answer for my bike, but for me, I'm afraid not a jot wiser. [Bridget] Oh, I knew it would be like this. Wind her up and she'll never stop. -Shh! -Stronger maybe. I now know for sure that ending up with egg on your face -doesn't matter, it's having -Well, well! -A go that counts. -Well, well, what? -Sandra. -And lastly, -to Loretta Lawson -[mutters] headband Sandra? -Steering me through the -Exactly. -Of publishing. -[applause] [tense music] [people chatter] Here please, ladies. Right here. [camera clicks] [camera clicks] -Hey, hey, hey. -Don't you know playing with the grown-ups can get little boys into trouble? Eh? I mean, haven't they taught you that yet? Tony! How long have you been here? Have you been following me? -Of course I have. -[people chatter] That's what you wanted isn't it? -Look here, I- -Look here! -You little... -[taps and slaps] For God's sake, Tony! He's my son! [nervous laughs] -[orchestral music] -[rapid footsteps] [birds cheeping] Oh, British summers. -Hello, Arthur! -Hello Dr. Bennet. How did the old girls' reunion go? Oh, a riot in every sense, and not so much of the old girl. Oh, these are no good, Arthur. You used to do a much better line in messages. Yeah. Sorry about that, Dr. Bennet. -[receding footsteps] -Why can't she stay away during the long vac Like everyone else? -[sighs] -I've no idea, Mr. Koogan. [tense music] -[footsteps on stairs] -[siren wails] [man shouts in street] [dial clicks] Sandra looks well on it. I'm only sorry I missed the floor show. Didn't seem to faze her much. -[chuckles] -D'you want a drink? Yeah, I'll get it. What about you? Yeah. -Yeah? -Yeah, thanks. Isn't her husband's supposed to be loaded? Some sort of importer or something? Yes, he is, but they're not together anymore. [hums musically] Ta. Oh, these are great! -Yeah. -They're great! Cheers. Oh, thanks. Loretta? -[can spurts] -Ahh! The thing is, we should talk. Well that's what we do. We talk. What about? Not about divorce. We haven't talked about that. No, we haven't. Well, maybe we should. A divorce? Whoof! Okay. I agree. Well, why now after all these years? Well... You met someone else. Yeah. -[taxi idles outside] -Hey. You don't mind? No, no. I'm thrilled for you. Do I know her? No, she's a student. [clears throat] A student? Well, not a student student. A mature student? No, actually, she's quite young. [intercom buzzes] -Yes? -[taxi drives off] It's Sandra. Hi. [birds cheeping] Come on, Dad, she doesn't even -know what it means! -Tony, Tony, stop, I'm not interested. What it comes down to is you lost her, you find her. I couldn't give a toss about the sodding money, but you get that book back and you get it back now. Shit! We've pumping from the mains for hours. You can imagine how I felt. Poor you. Hmm. The thing is... Well, you can see, I don't even have a spare bed. It's only for a day or two, till it dries out. Ahh, the book launch. Sandra, there must be someone else? Or a hotel? I don't need a hotel, I need a friend. [gentle music] [lock buzzes] Hi! [jams door] -[tense music] -Hi! -Just wanna talk. -Get out! Just wanna talk, okay? [water splashes] Oh, you are such a soft touch! -I know, I know! -When is she going? Well, I'm beginning to think never. [sighs] Hasn't she changed, though? Remember what she used to be like? Oh, Miss Home Counties, 1985? I think there's something wrong though. -Why? -No. She won't tell me anything, but, she's brittle and edgy. Every time the phone rings, she jumps a mile. Now, it just seems to me that it's just as much of an act as the old Sandra. For all this larking around, she's not happy. -[door clunks] -All yours. Oh. Sorry if I been a long time. -No, no, no, no. -You do look peaky, Bridget. -Do I? -You should have a couple of sessions on the sunbed. Why didn't you have a go with some of my blusher? It's all in there. Oh, righto. -Ow. -So, when are they coming? -Eight. -Well, you don't have to worry about me, you won't even know I'm here. I'll pop myself up in your room, Lo, all right? Yes, fine. Oh, d'you want to nip up and change first? I have changed, Sandra. Oh God. Sorry. [receding footsteps] [indistinct] a stone-cold bath water. [taxi pulls up] [engine clatters] -[taxi roars away] -[bike hums up] [engine putters] [smooth music plays] [door clunks] Excuse me. -Listen, I- -I will never let you -do this to me again. -How did I know? Why couldn't you have just gone out -with Michael by yourself? -Well I thought you -quite liked- -No, no, no, never, ever. Sorry. No ice. Michael's given you quite a build up, Loretta. Ph.D, English studies, lecturer at London University. It's a bit daunting for the likes of me. Oh, gosh. I thought you were bringing David? They wanted him in Luxembourg a day early. It was very last minute. Sorry. Wish I could live like this. So spontaneous, isn't it? I'm very tidy. Very clean. In fact, I don't like myself for it really, it's a bit of an affliction, in a way. Probably need some therapy. Do admire people like you. [distant footsteps] Sorry! No, I'm not here. You can't see me. I forgot my mag. Oh, what a nice surprise. Michael, Eric, Sandra. -Hi! -An old friend. Hi. -Oh, Loretta, no, honestly. -No, no. [Sandra] You're both academics too. I can tell. No, no, no, no. Corporate finance. Corporate finance? How fascinating. It's a great shame that Sandra -didn't feel like joining us. -It's a tragedy. But she seemed to want to curl up with a book. You think she really meant it? -[gate squeaks] -Oh, yes, yes. That was definitely her, "curling up with a book," outfit she had on. [taxi engine clatters] [tense music] -[taxi motors away] -[footsteps] [waves surge] [running footsteps] -[brakes squeal] -[laughing] Hang on, I'll come in. Oh, God! [laughing] -No. -Hang on, I'll come in. [laughing] Oh I thank you, thank you for a lovely evening. Well, did I know he'd turn into the lech of the month? Hey, turn to the night, bat girl. -[gate squeals] -[laughing] Don't want to disturb Sandra, do we? Oh, I live to disturb Sandra. -[manic laughing] -Shut up! [taxi purrs away] [door latch clangs] [glasses clink] [ominous music] [wind moans] -[waves surge] -[ominous music] [siren wails] [indistinct radio chatter] [muted chatter] Hi, yeah. It's me. Are you all right? Sorry. Yes, I'm fine. I'm just late. What is it? I've just come across a report about a road accident in Suffolk involving someone called Sandra Neil and I wondered if it could be the same one? Well, she didn't stay here last night. Yeah well, don't let's jump to conclusions. Let me read it to you. "In the early hours of this morning a body was recovered from the wreckage of a car that had been driven off a cliff on the Suffolk coast. The body's been identified as Mrs. Sandra Neil, -a 39-year old mother of two. -[tense music] Her husband Mr. Tom Neil and his children Elizabeth, nine, and Felix, 18, were notified in the early hours of this morning but were unavailable for comment." -[gulls crying] -[waves surging] -[church choir sings] -I understand your car will be taking the parents [indistinct]. -I can't believe we're late. -Well, it's hardly our fault, -and the roads were- -Of course it's our fault! We should have left earlier! Hell. Well we can't go in now. Let's not be standing here when they all come out, let's go straight to the house. [door clunks] That's her son, isn't it? Yep. [footsteps] Poor thing. They're horrid things funerals, aren't they? Yeah. Have we missed much of the service? I'm afraid so, yes. Do you know if it's far to the Neil's house? You're almost there. I'll show you. -This way. -Oh, thank you. [birds calling] [door clunks] [case unzips] I was in charge of the investigation into Sandra Neil's death. It was an accident wasn't it? Oh yes. Yes. I'm not here as a policeman. In fact, it's my day off. I just came to pay my respects. Nice family. Sandra was staying with me the night she crashed. Ah, the friend in London. Loretta Lawson, how d'you do? Bridget Bennet. -I'm Oscar Ghilardi. -[tense music] Ladies first. Oh, shit! [motorbike purrs away] There we are, Shore House. Thank you very much You wouldn't care for a quick drink afterwards, I suppose? Yeah. Good. Shall we say 6:00, the pub by the harbour? Fine. Small gate and then follow the cliff path. Okay, thank you. [Oscar] Bye. I just wish I hadn't got so irritated with her, that's all. And we shouldn't have left her on her own. Why did she drive down here in the middle of the night, though? Unless the kids were here, I suppose? No, they were going to a party. She was on the phone to Elizabeth just before you arrived. Sounded like the real Sandra, it was really nice. Wow. This is just a holiday home? She said she hated it here. [indistinct chatter] So where's your brother? He's in his room. He won't come out until everyone's gone. Then he'll be grumpy, I bet. Felix and I always talk about everything, until now. Well, I expect it's just his way of being sad? And Dad doesn't want to talk either. He keeps on crying and pretending it's okay. It's all right to be sad. Isn't it? It is, Lizzie, it is really. Thank you. Beautiful place. You manage to spend much time here? Almost every holiday. Though this summer I took the children to France. We didn't wanna be here without Sandra. We bought our half of it about 12 years ago. It's only an hour from Colchester. Splendid turnout, Tom. First rate service. -George Saunders. -Hello. Where's the skipper? He's upstairs. Oh, well I'll just nip up and have a word. Oh, leave him alone, George. Nonsense! Oh, Brian. Is Bridget a teacher too? Mm-hmm, in Cambridge in a place called St. Marks. -She teaches English. -The same as you? Hmm, similar sort of thing. Princess. Look, why don't I give you my number in London? And I'll give you Bridget's in Cambridge 'cause we're gonna be working there next week. And if you feel like a chat, you can just call. I thought you were on holiday? We are. [tailgate clunks] [birds calling] So have you an idea of what this argument was about? At the launch? No. -This man? -Tony. Yes. He show up at the flat at all? Well, I was out for a lot of the time, but I- -Thanks. -Thank you, my dear. No, no, I rather got the impression she was there very much on her own. Cheers. Thank you. Although, when I was clearing up after that last night, well there was an extra glass. There were glasses everywhere. No, no. Don't you remember Eric trotting around clearing everything up? Oh God, the affliction. Yes. There was Sandra's glass with her lipstick on it and another glass next to it. So, I guess somebody must've visited her? Well, brilliant. You've got that for fingerprints? No, no, I washed it up. Oh dear. Sorry. Didn't they have any smokey bacon? Did you notice that there was a broken window at the house? At the back? Mm-hmm. Odd. Someone had broken in and then cleared away all the glass. A burglar? Nothing was missing. Okay. Right. The burglar breaks in through the window and tidies away the broken glass. He's just about to load up with silver when Sandra arrives back and disturbs him. She freaks, goes screaming out of the house, gets into the car, drives like a maniac. The burglar loses his nerve and scarpers. Yes. That's a truly wonderful reconstruction. Just what I would expect from someone with a training in textual analysis. A tidy burglar! [laughs] -Loretta! -Lizzie! Hello. Ah, ladies, Inspector. Thought we'd blow the cobwebs away. Are you coming aboard? We have to be heading back, I'm sorry. Felix won't come with us either. Another time. It must be us Lizzie. -Have a nice trip. -Thanks. -Bye. -Bye. That was the man that found the body. George Saunders. He's a neighbour isn't he? -We met him at the house. -Yes, he lives next door. He drives up from London most weekends for the sailing. Seems to get on well with Lizzie. He's been awfully good to Felix, too. Who's been in a spot of bother lately. What sort of bother? Shoplifting, joyriding, that sort of thing. Family breakdown, I suppose? Are you married Dr. Bennet? No, I'm not. How wise. You've no idea the concentration of crime that surrounds marriage these days. [ominous music] She misjudged the bend here. By the look of it, fuddled with alcohol. She seems to have left your place in London in a hurry. No handbag, no coat. It was a cold night. Misty, touch of ground frost. The theory is she was gonna call in at Shore House and then head back along the coast road, where there was a party, an end of season sort of thing, mostly for the kids but parents looked in. Felix and Lizzie were there, sleeping over. And her husband? Oh, he dropped them off and then headed back home to Colchester. The police called him at three in the morning and told him the news. This is where she went through. They've fixed the fence already. Down there! Oh, God! At least she must have died instantly? Oscar, this is the only piece of dangerous high ground on what must be the flattest shoreline -in the county. -She had to know this road like the back of her hand. -The case is closed? -It would take a a deal more than a few loose ends to have it opened again. [phone rings] Hello? Hello? [dog barking] Hello! [slams handset] [door clunks] [coughs] -[tuts] -[sighs] [dramatic tones] [phone rings] [Tom] This is Colchester 3102. Leave your message after the tone. [beep] Hello Tom. This is Loretta Lawson. [clears throat] I'm afraid. I found another piece of Sandra's luggage. I'm so sorry. Maybe you could phone me and we'll work out what to do about it? As from this afternoon, I'll be in Cambridge on... [tense music] Tom, I'll phone you back. [handset clunks back] [footsteps] [door clunks] [Answerphone] Hello Tom. This is Loretta Lawson. [indistinct chatter] -[phones ring] -[zip pulled] [zip pulled] Listen, Loretta, this is nothing to do with you. Legally it belongs to the husband. Where it came from or -what it's doing here -Sorry. Has nothing to do with you. It was in my airing cupboard. Yes. She was your guest. -Well, Bridget says- -Yes, I'm sure that Bridget knows exactly what should be done. In fact, I'm surprised that you bothered to ask my advice when you could consult the Oracle! Shh! Why are you being so grouchy? And I haven't come to ask your advice. Well I have, but I've also come to give you these. What? Ah. The divorce papers. Oh, God, Loretta I'm sorry. It's been a lousy week. Evidently. Were there any problems? Did you manage to work it out? Yes, I could work it out. Here and there even managed some joined up writing. [rustling paper] -I'm sorry. -Sorry. Now there is one tiny little thing too, tiny. That is if we're still in business, you and I? Yeah. Sure. Well, Sandra said that she'd stopped being a secretary and she'd started up this business, a health club. -What's it called? -The Carlisle club. And you want it checked out? Please. Okay. Right. Well, I'm going straight up to Bridget's now, so, you can get me there if anything really interesting comes up. -Bye! -Well, what are you gonna do with that now? Well, I'm gonna take it up to Cambridge. Tom might want to pick it up from there. But you can't go wondering about with a bear stuffed to the gills with 10,000 quid! Shh! It's all right. I'm not going to lurk in any dark corners. Or go off with any strange men. [door clunks] [engine starts] [car drives off] [vacuum cleaner whirs] I'm just going to Sarah's, Mrs. Hicks. Don't be late back. [classical music] She was running away wasn't she? Used my place for somewhere to hide. Didn't they think of looking there? After all, I thought George hadn't seem them for years? DR. Bennet, Dr. Lawson, skiving again? Of course! Why don't you come with us Arthur? You'll let him off Mr. Koogan, won't you? Oh, go on. [gentle music] John says we should mind our own business. He's in a foul mood. Oh, that's the schoolgirl wearing him out. No, no, that's all going swimmingly. And even though she's young, she's very young, she's also a tremendously mature, wonderful witty, and dazzlingly talented redhead. -And we hate her? -Yes, we really hate her! [rapid footsteps] [bell tolls] [orchestral music segues to tense music] Yeah, hi, it's a Cambridge number. [Operator] What name is it, please? Bennet. Dr. Bridget Bennet. -Bennet? -Yeah, thanks. [Operator] The number you require is Cambridge, 0223. [gentle music] All this ought to be in the cubby holes by now. And don't slouch. Slouch? I don't slouch. Yes madam, what can I do for you? Want some lunch? What's going on? Where do you think you're going? I'm escorting this young lady on a tour of the colleges. Well what about the desk? Dave's taking over. Not without my permission, he's not. You gave that over a week ago, Mr. Koogan, when you put me on late's, again. It's my afternoon off. Oh, look, why do I always look as if I've been hit in the small of the back by the 8:45 from Paddington? Aw! Felix looks happy there, doesn't he? [indistinct chatter] Dr. Bennet. Lizzie! Did dad really say it was all right for me to stay? He's fine. He's going to pick you up from my place in London tomorrow night. Good. We've all got another day together. What are those? We were looking at these before you came. They were taken at the book launch. Any of mummy? Thank you Ma'am. Thank you, thank you. Felix is there in the background. Felix, at a book thing? She's wearing her Paris suit. Where's Felix? There. -That's Paul Elvin. -[tense music] Do you know Paul? He used to go to school with Felix. He was cricket captain. Oh, I'm hopeless with names. No, no, I don't know him. People sort of turn up at those things, you see. [tense music] You! What are you doing here? Really, this is crazy. Let's get out of here and we can talk. You bastard! You shit! -You bloody wrecker! -Wrecker? Who are you calling a wrecker? I'll kill you! -[bat clunks] -[screams] [Bridget] Oh, marvellous control, Arthur. Shouldn't you be singing something in Italian? [Arthur] úSorry. I haven't got the hat for it, ma'am. [Lizzie] Felix always used to make me laugh, and now something bad has happened. He's angry all the time. That since mummy died? No. Since before. Since they sent the tie. The tie? Felix's school tie. It came in a packet to mummy from a hotel. They said her son had left it behind. Felix has never been to any hotel. There was awful trouble, and now he keeps getting into trouble, and... And what, Lizzie? He didn't tell the truth about when mummy died. In what way? About where he was. We were asked to a party. We were staying the night, but as soon as dad dropped us off Felix left. He was gone ages. You won't tell dad any of this will you? [ducks quacking] Thanks for the loan of Arthur, Mr Koogan, jolly kind. Oh, I took a call from your brother, Dr. Bennet. -My brother? -Yes. What did he say? Not a lot. Wanted to know where you were. And did you tell him? Well, had I been informed of your whereabouts Dr. Bennet, I would've been happy to oblige, but as it was, I was unable to help. And did he leave a message? No. Truth to tell, he was what I can only describe as curt! Just a sec, just see if Oscar's rung back. What's the matter? Oh, it's just a mix up. Bridget doesn't have a brother. Everything's a mix up. [phone rings] -[door slams] -Message for you, sir. -Thank you. -A lady. Dr. Bennet? Rung a couple of times now. Thank you, Steven. [clatter of feet] Where the hell have you been, Ghilardi? And what the hell is all this? It looks like rather than lengthy printout, sir. Or maybe it's one of those Andrex adverts, with the puppy. It's a 20 bloody three page printout, Ghilardi! From pathology, on the Neil case. Which correct me if I'm wrong is now dead and buried! Well that's as maybe sir, but the thing- Right! Since that is, "As maybe," I would deem it a great personal favour, Ghilardi, if you could get your frigging finger out and get on with their job in hand! [door slams] -You, with me! -Oh dear. [approaching footsteps] She's just coming down, she fell asleep. Tom, Bridget and I'd be delighted to help whenever we can. Well that's kind, but I usually have things pretty well worked out. I'm sure you do. I'm just being selfish. She's a pleasure to have around. She's a great little girl. I know. Would you like another drink? No, thank you. Tom, this is the bag that I found. Lizzie must've been thrilled. Well, I haven't given it to her. It's full of money. A great deal of money. -[phone rings] -Excuse me. [tense music] Hello? Hello? -[approaching footsteps] -Hello? Hi, Dad. -Hi, Lizzie. -Who is this? [slams handset] [phone rings] Yeah, hello? Bridget, it's Oscar. Oscar Ghilardi. Oscar. Oh, hello. Er, yes, er, hello, how are you? Fine. Look, I was wondering if we could meet? Well, thing is I'm pretty tied up for some time. Certainly most evenings totally down the pan with work and stuff, you know? New term. I'm not suggesting we go on a cruise, Bridget. You left a message. Something about a bear? Yes, I know, the money. Yes. Look, things have been a bit hectic up here, but I have to be in London for a few days. Perhaps we could meet then? Oh, and I can bring the pathology report. [door handles click] -[door clunks] -[tense music] [door slams] [dog barks] -[screams] -[bottle smashes] I'm so sorry. I'm terribly sorry. -I'll get you another one. -Leave it please. It's a pint of milk, I'll do it later, please. I didn't mean to startle you. I just wanted to talk. About Sandra? Yeah, my name's Paul Elvin. Yes, I know. What about Sandra? It's a bit awkward here. Well, it's here or nowhere. The night she died, I was in your flat. [tense music] I can't, I can't get out of my head how she was when I left her, she was terrified. What of? I don't know. She wouldn't say. I reckon it might've been the health club. I thought that was a great success? No, she wanted out. She put money into it, but it wasn't working. I'm not sure why. Anyway, she wanted it back. They weren't having it. So she just helped herself? Well, she'd never have taken it if I hadn't won a scholarship. What? I got this cricket scholarship to Australia. Was Sandra gonna go with you? Yeah. [car hums up] -[radio chatter] -Lizzie? Lizzie, come on. We're home. Yeah, I can understand that. Need to start again. Get away. I don't know why she chose me. Maybe, well maybe because I wasn't much of a challenge? But it could have been anyone. I always knew that. I'm sure that's not true. Oh yeah. She just needed someone around to make her feel good. She didn't seem to think too much of herself, which was crazy. She was amazing, wasn't she? That night. How long did you stay here? Oh, not late. It had just hit her. This was it. We really were leaving the next day. She got into a panic about Felix and Lizzie and said she wanted to be on her own. So I, I left. I waited for her for hours at Heathrow the next morning. In the end, I phoned the house in Colchester. I couldn't face any more flack from Felix, but I didn't know what else to do. As it turned out, I got the housekeeper. She, she told me. How'd you mean, "More flack from Felix?" Since he found out about us. God knows how. Well he'd taken to phoning me at home and going apeshit. He called that night around midnight, screaming about how he was gonna kill both of us. He even had a go at me at a sports club yesterday. [gasps] Police came for him but he did a runner. What are you saying? That Felix had something to do with his mother's death? Maybe? No, I'm just saying anything. But why was she so scared? Oh, I don't know. It doesn't make sense, does it? You know that bloke that turned up at the launch, Tony? Was he something to do with the club? I dunno. I think he's just someone who kept pestering her. He soon ran out of steam. -[tense music] -Well, who's the other bloke? Gave her much more grief. Even turned up at her flat. That's why she moved out in the end. She said there was a flood. It was a Friday night, wasn't it? The night of the crash? Yes. Why? I don't know why I didn't think of it before. Maybe there is something I can do. Thanks for the coffee. Well, where are you going? I'll call you tomorrow. -[dramatic music] -[motorbike starts] [purrs away] [car hums past] [traffic hums past] [bottles clink] Felix. Oh my God, your father phoned. Everyone's looking for you. What are you doing here? Come on, old chap, can't be as bad as all that. What lunatic parked that car like that? I did. I borrowed it. -[traffic rushes past] -[door slams] No, they never say anything, but there is definitely someone there. I can hear the click when they hang up. It's happened three times now. Have you told the phone company? No, not yet. -Well, you should. -[phone rings] There's the stuff there from your club, which is of course why you're really here? Thanks. Anything? I haven't read it to be honest. There's not much there, by the look of it, they don't go in for much in the way of publicity. What's that? It's a clock. [Loretta] It's a clock and two potatoes. [John] Well done. Well, is it like one of those experiments you did at school? It's a gift. -[chuckles] -Who from? From Natalie's mother. Oh, from Natalie's mother. It's rather ingenious actually. The potato powers the clock. Right. Right. [dramatic music] [fire crackles] [car engine revs] [handbrake clicks on] Felix. Where were you? The police came. What happened? [door clunks] Hello, Lizzie. Uncle George. Where's your father? He's out the back burning rubbish. Fine. Come on. Felix? [tense music] Tom. He's got something to tell you. Thanks for bringing him back, George. [traffic roars past] [horn beeps] [Bridget] How did you get an address? [Loretta] In amongst all the stuff that John gave me -about the club. -Hmm. Why are we doing this? [Loretta] I'm not quite sure. [car door closes] [Bridget] They must have taken her name away. -Well there's one here. -No, hang on. Sorry, excuse me. I wonder if you could help us? We were told that a Mrs. Sandra Neil lived here. Who sent you? No one. She was a friend. You best come in. [Loretta] Well we just want to find out anything we can. [Janet] Well, she hasn't lived here for five weeks. [Bridget] Five weeks? I was in a bit of a jam and she was moving out anyway so she said I could have it until I got myself sorted. Well, no one come near the place so I just stayed on for a bit. Were you her friend? Not really. We worked together at the same law firm, Ricards and Bergson, till she had to leave. Had to? Well it's no secret. She got the sack because she had an affair with a client. Well is that a sacking matter? With this client it was. Why did you say, "Who sent you?" It started a couple of days before she died. This man kept phoning. I told him I didn't know where she was and he, he showed up here. He said, he said he was gonna get her anyway and I'll be next. Next thing she's dead. What did he look like? Was he around 30, fair hair, a bit flash? Then last night I was laying in bed, watching telly, and this other man showed up in the doorway. he started screaming and yelling at me to get out there and then! Dear God, what did you do? Well I went to phone the police, but he broke down. Started wailing like a kid, took the rest of her things and left. What did he look like? Tallish, middle-aged, just looked ordinary. [car horn beeps] [distant children playing] Felix. [tense music] Um. did she mention the club? -The health club? -Yeah. Yeah, she was always going on about it. It was going to change her life. [door opens] So where was she for those five weeks? The club? Who do you think the, the other man is? -The middle-aged man? -Well, it's gotta be Tom, hasn't it? Well. Oh, he's here. I think he's a bit odd. Why? Just 'cause he's on time? Of course not. He's definitely odd though. Hi, Oscar. Bridget. Hello? Loretta. Lovely. Sorry, are we? Ah, yes. Excuse me. Is it all right to move there? No, sorry, that's for a large party. Good. Thank you. [tense music] Yes, sit down if you will, and roll up your sleeve. That should deal with any anxiety. Didn't know you were keen on sport, Oscar? Sport? Oh, that? Yes, I found that in the gents loo along with "Catering Now." What, winning ways with a wok? -[chuckles] -Yes. But I can run to a brisk round of Scrabble, if pressed. It happened later than I thought, the time of death? Yes. I'm afraid that she did not die instantly. -It took some time. -[piano music plays] Oh, God. Look, I've had some feedback on that information that your friend got. Oh, on the Carlisle Club? Yes, exactly. Ha, to the glorious computer. I don't suppose you two use it much in your line of business? All the time actually. -Oh. -Well? Well, the club is owned by Steven and Tony Fleming, a son and father. The son has a bit of form, but seems to have got off unscathed so far thanks to his lawyers. I'll bet they're Ricard's and Bergson's? It must be the same, Tony? Ah, may I? Thank you. Fraud had a good look at the club over the last few months, but didn't seem to come up with much. Now, can we eat? Well, I'm gonna have one of these. I'll bring the rest of your things tomorrow and I'll call you tonight. -Take care, Felix. -[engine ticks over] [car drives away] [door clunks shut] What's happening? He's going to be looked after, Lizzie. He'll be back to the old Felix in no time at all. Why don't you come and stay with me for a few days? No, I don't think so. Thank you. [receding footsteps] -Hi, sorry I'm late. -Ah! The usual last minute chaos. I'm off to Moscow in the morning. John Tracy, Oscar Ghilardi. Hi Oscar, nice to meet you. John's my ex or my almost ex husband. And he leads this very sophisticated life. Today Leytonstone, tomorrow Leningrad. I mean, we feel so humble that you managed to fit us in. What are you having? Another one of these I think. Can we have another one of these please? -And do you do cigarettes? -Yes. A packet of Benson's please. And a vodka tonic. And Oscar, what would you like? No, no, I'm fine thanks. Oh, and a glass of hemlock for the lady in the corner. [tense music] [footsteps] [phone rings] [laughing] It's a shame I've got to go, I was just beginning to enjoy myself. Where are you going? I'm going to dinner with Natalie's parents. Ah! In Chigwell. -Oh dear. -[snorts] -[laughing] -I know. Actually they don't even seem to like me very much. What are you saying, that's extraordinary. I can't understand that. That is me. Lovely, thank you. Sod it! Excuse me. Could we have another one of those, please? Well, I'd better telephone. -Yes. -It's on the bar. -Oh, thanks. -Wonderful. [Oscar] Mmm, lovely. I think yours seems to be a little bigger than mine. [Bridget] I think this has been wokked. [Oscar] Yes, but it's very "Catering Now," isn't it? [chuckles] [tense music] May I see? Looks like "An early morning swimmer found the body of 20-year old Paul Elvin floating in Highgate Ponds early this morning. Police are not at this stage treating the matter as a drowning. A white Toyota Celica has been seen in the vicinity of the Elvin home on two or three occasions recently." [Lizzie] Can you find out where he is and get to me? Because, I don't know if he's all right. Bye. -[call disconnects] -[machine beeps] Oh, we have to stop this, we're getting in far too deep. That's two people who've walked out of this flat- I know, I know. Want tea? Yeah. [tense music] You started smoking again? No. Are they still here? I'm not going in there! [door bangs open] [clunk] [tense music] No. Well, that's how they go in. Right. Come on. We're going to a hotel. We can't stay here, they might come back. [clattering downstairs] No, let's see what's missing first. Everything's been moved. It's all here. Including 50 pounds in cash. Everything's here too. Hang on. The photos are missing! How weird. Who'd want to take the photos of the book launch? Any normal psychopath. Now we just grab our things and walk out of here. We'll go to a hotel, but we could go to my mother's. What am I saying? We'll go to a hotel! We seem so wet! So we are wet! [phone rings] [tense music] Don't answer it, let it ring. This is ridiculous. Hello? It's Lizzie. Must be taking Felix to a hospital, poor kid. What I find really baffling is why Tom can't realise how frightening all this is for Lizzie. Not having anyone to talk to. Well, maybe he just doesn't know how to talk to her. Well it's hell for that child. And she's being so brave. Puts us all to shame. [tense music] So you keep saying, and now I'm the one sleeping nearest the door. Well, they did come in through the window. Of course, the really bright thing to do were to phone Oscar. He did give us his number where he's staying. Well we can't ring him now. You're right. It's just about now he turns into a werewolf. -[banging] -[yell] [gasps] [door clatters open] [door slams] Hello, I've, um, -had, ooh, -[phone clatters] had a spot of bother with Natalie and I'm locked out. -Homeless. -And legless. Yes. Ooh. Ooh. -Oof. -Ahh! I knew you'd understand. Ah. Ah! Oh well, I feel much safer now! -[birds calling] -[waves roaring] [gulls crying] [gentle music] [birds tweeting] Felix? Hello. My name's Loretta. I'm a friend of Lizzie's. Is Lizzie here? No, she isn't. She asked me to visit you for her, though. Can I sit down? I spoke to your father. He's coming tomorrow. Lizzie asked me to bring you these. She said they have favourites. You're a friend of Lizzie's? Yes, I am. It was worse for her. I couldn't tell her anything. She kept looking at me. I kept trying to phone her, but, we never knew where she was, never. [tense music] Lizzie would sit by the phone for hours. Dad kept trying to make it right, but, 'Cause of me they met. He was the captain of the school cricket team. Paul? Yes, I know. All of it was my fault. It was because of Elvin she crashed. It was because of him she got so angry! How'd you know she was angry? Were you with her when she got angry? No, I was at the party. You were seen leaving the party. I was there all the time. Ask Lizzie! No don't. Leave her alone. Felix. Do you really think it was an accident? Yes. Why? It was all finished anyway. What do you want? Why are you here? I'm a friend of Lizzie's. And I was a friend of your mother's. She didn't have any proper friends. [slams down the bars] [door clunks] -[engine starts] -[dramatic music] [car pulls away] [car door slams] Lizzie? It's Felix. No, no, listen, listen! You've got to do something for me. -[water runs] -[phone rings] Hello? Bridget? Oscar. Oh! What the hell are you still doing there? I told you to go! -Why, you checking up on us? -You bet I am. I thought you said you'd leave for Cambridge first thing this morning? Well, Loretta already has, and I'm going up after lunchtime seminar. Surely this is no longer an arena for a couple of amateur sleuths? All right. All right. You made that perfectly clear last night. Look, we'll both be in Cambridge by this evening. Check again if you like. I've got a dinner engagement. Oh. Anything about Paul? No, not yet. I'll let you know. And promise me, no more meddling? Absolutely. No more meddling. -Good, bye. -Okay, bye. [tense music] [taxi engine clatters] Yep, yeah. Look, I'm gonna leave my bags, okay? I'll be about five minutes. -Okay. -All right, thank you. [door clunks] [footsteps] [soft jazz music] Carlisle Club. No, I'm afraid she isn't in today. She's available Friday. Okay? And that is 10:45. Okay, bye. Welcome to the Carlisle Club. May I help you? Yes. I heard a while ago you might be looking for some experienced staff? A domestic, yes? Sorry? Well, domestic or professional? Professional. Definitely. Sport, massage or individual room service? Room service. So who do I see about an interview? Well, you see me first of all, Miss, er...? Excuse me. -Good morning. -Morning, Mr. Rankin. -Nice to see you, Gloria? -Thank you. Thank you very much. All right? Thanks. Bye. Well actually it was a friend who suggested I might to fit in rather well here. Sandra Neil. Did you know Sandra? Mrs. Neil was only with us very briefly. We have a new manager now. Oh, Tony. Well, any chance of a word with Tony? Tony Fleming. Well, why don't you ask him yourself? [tense music] Oh, well maybe not precisely now this minute. Why don't I drop a line? Yeah, I'll just... [door opens] -[footsteps] -Well, well now, Dr. Bennet, I presume? [distant machine whirring] Well actually, on reflection, I think the job may be too demanding. I was looking for something a bit more casual. Oh, we do casual Dr. Bennet. [drawer opens] We do very casual, indeed. All the same, I'm not really sure it's sort of job that I'm particularly looking for it with my height. We don't want them. You can keep them. Not talking holiday snaps here, are we? Oh, aren't we? All right, if you're having a good time we can keep us up as long as you like Dr. Bennet. Or may I call you Bridget? No, you may not. And if this is about the money. Huh, I kissed that goodbye the day I went soft on that silly whore. Then why did he break into my friend's flat? It can't have been for the photos. I let him go after the money to take his mind off her. Gotta keep him off the streets, haven't you? And did it keep him off the streets the night Paul Elvin died? He was at home with me and his mum. [scoffs] Oh dear. Look, I can see why you might be anxious. It is your son's car the police are looking for. And he had at least one very public fight with a dead boy. And that was over a woman who also died in violent circumstances. Which is why we're very pleased to see you, Dr. Bennet. We've got a bit of a proposition for you. Look, I really don't have time for this. -[door closes] -Just give me a minute. Now, I know what you're thinking, but really you couldn't be further from the truth. I had nothing to do with Sandra's death and I did not kill Paul Elvin. I've been following him. Yes. In fact, I was on his tail when he left the teachers. He went straight from there to a house in Hampstead, Ashcroft Way. He was in there for hours. I couldn't hang around. So? The bloke that let him in the door, I'd seen him before. When? At the Suffolk place. Oh. So it was you that the broken there too? Yeah. Trying to get our stuff back, yes. But I wasn't the only person there that night! Now, all I know is I was upstairs looking around. All of a sudden somebody comes in downstairs. Doesn't turn any lights on, nothing. Within a minute he's on his way out. I can see him leaving from the window. He walks to the middle of the drive. Stops, picks up a shoe, a woman's shoe. He goes to the edge of the cliff and chucks it in the sea. And this was the same man that was in the house in Hampstead? Well, it was the middle of the night, but yeah, I reckon it was him. All right. So what do you want from me? We want the book back. The book? [tense music] [running footsteps] -[door clunks] -King's Cross, please. [engine starts] [taxi putters away] [car crunches on gravel] [John] What's all that noise? Where are you? I'm at King's Cross. Now do me a favour, I can't get hold of anyone else. You put it so well. Is there such a thing as a street directory? You know, a list of the names of people who live in a street? Why? [gravel crunches] 35 pounds. 10%, three pounds 50. 38 pounds 50? [door clunks] [car revs away] [haunting tones] [switch clicks on and off] Good God, man, you'd think we were off for a night out in an abattoir! If only. [doors clunk] [engine starts] -[car revs away] -Inspector! Oh. -[footsteps] -[bells toll] Oh, Dr. Lawson! I've been trying to track down Dr. Bennet. Any ideas? Well, she should be here. There's been a phone call from Mr. Neil. -Lizzie's gone missing -[tense music] and he was hoping she might've turned up here again. But some cash and some keys to his place in Suffolk have gone too. When did he call? Not more than about half an hour ago. The thing is, he's had his phone, his electric cut off. Where was he phoning from? London. Well in that case, I can get that long before he does. Thank you, Arthur. Could you tell Dr. Bennet when you see her? -Yeah, certainly. -Thank you. [car hums past] [printer chatters softly] [beeps] [huffs] Mr. Koogan? Ah, Dr. Bennet. Ah, has anything come in for me? What sort of thing would that be, Dr. Bennet? A message or a fax. A fax. -Ooh! -This machine is not for general use. Dr. Bennet. -A memo has been a circulated. -Yes, all right, all right. Oh, and Arthur asked me to tell you that Dr. Lawson had to go to Suffolk, something to do with a small girl being on her own. [dramatic tones] -[car drives up] -[tense music] [pulls zipper] [door closes] Lizzie! What are you doing here in the dark? The door was open. I'm not doing anything. I just wanted to come down for a bit. I tried to phone daddy, but the phone doesn't work and the lights don't come on. So I see. You'd best come next door with me. I think I'll just wait here. Thank you. Lizzie. Who are you waiting for? [car pulls up] [door clunks] Lizzie? Lizzie, it's Loretta. -[laughing] -[applause] [Man] No, no. It's our retiree you should be applauding, not me. All I say is that- [door creaks] Oh, hello. There's no electricity. Would you like to come next door with me? I just want to stay here. I know where there are candles and things. Well, Tom should be here shortly. Fair enough. But remember I'm just through the wall if there's anything you want. Or if you change your mind. -[door closes] -Why are you here, Lizzie? Felix. Felix is in bad trouble. He killed mummy. -[tense music] -[footsteps] [Woman] Turn right at the tops of the stairs love and then it's first on your left. -On the? -Left. Left, thank you. [indistinct chatter] Philip, hello. Oscar! Bridget! What are you doing here? I must go. Yes, good night. Good night Philip, nice seeing you. -Good night, Oscar. -Night, Reg. Look. Look at this. Yes. -Well? -Well, Loretta is on her own down at Shore House with Lizzie. And it's the weekend. So? He's always there at the weekends. Bridget, what are you talking about? [owl hoots] -[tense music] -We'll have to use your car. But I don't have one. -You don't have a car? -Well not here. Bloody good do, eh, Oscar? Fine bunch of men when see 'em like that together. Eating, drinking. Renaissance princes. This way sir. Reg, Reg! Grand speech, Reg. Family values. Spot on. Well done, Reg. Thanks very much. Family values. Can't beat them. My wife's a saint, you know. A saint. Is there a Mrs. Oscar, Oscar? Yes sir, my mother. Shore House, Ted, fast as you can. [Chief Supt. Allan] Wonderful things mothers. I've got a mother. [Oscar] Have you really, sir? [car stops quickly] [tense music] [revs away] I knew Felix was sort of angry at mummy, but I never thought he'd really hurt her. Then he told those lies. He didn't have glasses. He phoned me and asked me to come and throw them into the sea. She had to put these on when she drove. Always. Maybe she forgot. Lizzie, your mummy was on her own when she crashed. But why are they all smashed up? Why did Felix hide them? I don't know. I don't know the answer to any of these questions. I can only guess. And that's nearly always a very silly thing to do. The really brave thing is to wait until we know the truth. Hmm? [car rushes past] What's going on? What's all that bloody water doing there? Thought we'd take the coast road, sir. Lovely moon. You what? Who the hell are you? -[car drives up] -Is that daddy? Yes, it's daddy. [feet crunch on gravel] Hey. How are you? What on earth made you come here? I tried to phone. Hi, Loretta. [clock ticks] [tense music] Her glasses. I forgot her glasses. Lizzie. I want you to stay here for a moment and I have to go and talk the your daddy, okay? Everything's gonna be all right. Sandra called me that night. She said she had something important to discuss with me. I thought I kidded myself that it was about her coming back to live with us. You see, I didn't know that Felix had overheard the conversation and he followed me back here after I dropped them off at the party. He told me after that he watched us arguing till he couldn't take it any more. And he ran back to the party. And what did she want? Lizzie. She wanted Lizzie! She decided to go to Australia the next day. And she wanted to take Lizzie with her. She wouldn't listen. I just wanted her to listen, so I... I grabbed her. [dramatic tones] And the next thing I knew she was on the floor and she didn't move. [door squeaks] Felix must have found the glasses later and hidden them to protect me. [Loretta] So after she'd fallen, what happened then? Well I phoned George. He came over and he took her pulse, and he persuaded me that we had to make it look like an accident. [door bangs] Yes, yes I did. Sandra was dead. There was nothing to be gained by telling the truth. [scoffs] That wouldn't have brought her back. It was time to, to think of the children, of Lizzie and, and Felix. Those children needed a father. So you both decided to fake her accident? Well, I went to phone the police and when I came back, Tom had left and he'd taken Sandra's body with him. -George. -And I think he was absolutely right to do that. -That's not what happened! -Because sometimes you have to put the children first. But she wasn't dead. What? That's nonsense! No, no. I read the pathologist's report. The time of death was stated at sometime after the crash. She was still alive when she went over that cliff. You said she was dead. Now Tom. You took her pulse. You said, "She's gone." -Tom. -[boot lid slams] We dragged her to the car. We put her in the car, and we pushed her over the cliff edge. She was still alive! [car smashes on rocks] What does it matter anyway? I mean, now's not the time to lose your head. Over that whore. Don't call her a whore. Well what would you like me to call her? She was a whore! And you made it easy for her, didn't you? I mean, what did you think we were doing all those summer months when you were busy and we were left here alone, hmm? What'd you think? It was your fault. [scoffs] And it wasn't difficult to wear her down, I can tell you that. You killed Paul Elvin. [dramatic music] Yes. She wouldn't stop whoring, with that boy, that kid. A schoolboy cricketer. I set her up in a flat. I paid for everything. I found them together in my bed. [rushing footsteps] And she was going to take Lizzie away. [waves surge] Lizzie! Lizzie! I have to talk to you! Please Lizzie! The... Oh. Oh. [rushing footsteps] Where is she? Lizzie? [door slams] -[engine starts] -Lizzie! [wheels spin on gravel] Lizzie! [car hums along] [objects clatter] Lizzie! [tyres screech] Lizzie! Are you all right? [car hums along] -[indistinct chatter] -Are you all right? [tyres crunch on gravel] [engine revs] -Get out of the road! -Get out! [fence splinters] -[car roars off] -[dramatic music] Right, Ted, let's go. [cars roar along] [tyres squeal] Hope he knows more than I do. [tyres screech] [engine revs] -[tyres squeal] -[engine roars] Go! [fence smashes] [haunting music] Lizzie's our secret, George. Promise me that? [wood splinters] [engine roars] [loud crashing] -[indistinct chatter] -[crunching footsteps] Yeah, I'll have that, it's okay. [Bridget] Loretta. The book. [Loretta] What book? -[waves surge] -[gulls crying] Well, fraud are having fun with it now. They had a tip off that the Carlisle was a brisk little number in money laundering, but they had to back off, not enough of the right sort of proof. They needed names. And now they've got them in excelsis. [Bridget] So, what'll happen to Tom? [Oscar] He'll probably get bail, but in the end, who knows? They'll take into account the children, his state of mind at the time, but it really could go either way. You know, if it hadn't been for Felix and Lizzie he'd have got away with it. Yep. All of them. Hm. [birds calling] When you asked me to dinner, Bridget, I thought, "Oh, Cambridge, high table, English crystal, fine wines, erudite conversation." Did you? Pass the chutney, Lo. Not chicken korma in Camden. Can I have another beer? Yes. There you go. Natalie used to be a wonderful cook. I'm sure she still is a wonderful cook somewhere. [can opens] Did I tell you about me and the Carlisle Club? Yeah. When you asked me to send the fax. That was only a bit of it. I am telling you it was like finding yourself in a very bad B-movie. [laughing] They kidnapped me. I was kidnapped, and then they threatened me. -Threatened you? -Yes. What with? Well, with general menace. [laughing] -To the cook. -Yeah. -Cheers. -To Felix's first weekend home. [gentle music] And Lizzie. Hiya. And, to the status quo.
