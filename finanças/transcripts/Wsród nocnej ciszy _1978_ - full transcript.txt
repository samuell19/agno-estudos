— Give it to me! We'll start from the second verse — It's getting dark, father It's not safe to go home alone — You're stupid! It's not dark at 4pm — Some of us live far away. Until they get home... — He's right! There was a kid murdered recently... — But don't be late on next rehearsal! Since today you'll be getting mark on religion lessons! — They usually find it with these murdered kids — Did you bring it to the rehearsal? — Everybody has one now They bring to school every newspaper which says anything about the killings — Gross! Take it away! I hope that you don't condone it, Herman! — No, father I loathe everything that involves suffering or Police — Teachers' council had a sitting doday your cerificate will be excellent! Did you think about your future yet? — No, father. I still have so many years of learning ahead — I told you to take it easy, mother! — I'll not let you come home alone! Those kids were murdered in the middle of the town! — Excuse me, Wiktor You could also be hunting the killer You seem to know so much about him... Just imagine how cool would it be! — Man, Waciak couldn't hold it I know about my certificate — Is it what you thought? — Sure — Congratulations, Wiktor! — But... you have better chance than the police They have too much routine, and you are so smart! — What way are you heading? — As usual... — We go other way today. See you — Fast, slow, fast, slow... — Hey, what's that? — It's a tango It's a new dance, very fashionable! — How do you know it? — Goska has a record Her father brought it from Warsaw — Wait, a shoelace... — That guy is following you — What guy? — I told you in the morning, he followed you to school — What is it? — Come with me! Is he coming here? — Sure. Who is it? — It is Raster He makes specimens for Biology Institute He works with dead bodies, he potters in their guts! — Are you afraid of him? — It's not this! — Wrap it up, please! — This must be something for you! "Little performer — didactic game for youth" — See? You will change your looks so that no scary preparator will recognize you Like this! — You look splendid! — I'll sharpen this sword I'll cut everybody who gets near you For I am Ricky Costello! — Indeed! Ricky Costello! — Did you come here to have fun? or you want to buy something? — We only want to help our parents to choose gifts — Look, there's so much in the news about this toy — Drop this disgusting thing! How can they sell it after all this! — I am late, excuse me everything goes wrong today Tell him you were sleeping or he'll be angry again The young sir fell asleep while reading He's washing hands right now — Excuse me, I didn't hear the clock — I didn't tell you to sit down You must know at what time the dinner is eaten in this house — But... Let me explain — The man who is lying doesn't deserve to be heard — But his soup gets cold... — Take this soup to the kitchen You will be punished — Drop this! Drop this immediately! Begone! Begone to your room! Throw it in the furnace! — Slowly, slowly, faster, faster — Now, with right leg — I don't like this tango of yours — All Europe dances like this! — It will never catch on A woman hugging a man in the dance? — Somebody's ringing? — Doorbell is ringing! — It's good you dropped in We're practising tango right now — Can you give me the key? — What happened? — Just give it to me, please — But, come in. My parents like you so much Wait here — Bernard, who was it? — It was Wiktor Herman — Why didn't you bring him in? — He didn't want to. I think he quarreled with his father — His father is a monster, he likes to hang people — What are you talking about? — Everybody says that! — He went to the gallows, too He shot Lewandowski with it Remember this 7mm? — "Socha case" — Yes, I still have a scar after that — Death sentence, too — This one only doesn't have his story for 3 months I stare at this Maybe this juxtaposition is key to the secret of the killings — I lied to you I didn't come here by chance Pass the case to Chocianowicz I am asking you as a friend — The worst detective in our department? — Don't be stubborn You know well that this type of murderer can go unpunished for years You don't know his motive which could lead you to him You must wait for his mistake Wait for another murdered kid And one more The press will not spare you Public opinion will need a scapegoat I don't want you to be one — Who wants the investigation to drag? — You don't see the severity of the situation Workers can also shoot at police here like they did 3 weeks ago in Krakow This murderer is our big chance It should be main topic of all newspapers Even if artificially maintained — Hey, young man! Where are you going? — Don't you recognize me? We keep that boat over there — What happened? Is it your father again? — I'm not coming home Any excuse is good to torment me — He is a bit rough but he loves you in his own way — He hates me, he doesn't like you either He hates everybody I make friends with He's just sick when sees me smiling I'm not coming back home I'll go to Gdansk to enlist on a ship worst helpmate has better life than me — What about our boat then? We put so much work in it Wiktor, I was looking forward to the holidays Just think about it, Wiktor 3 months together Nobody else, just two of us — He will never let me go on this voyage — He must agree, we'll make up something We still have 6 months till holidays We'll figure out something to change his mind — You don't know him If he decides something, nothing changes his mind — Do you know how could we gain his grace? You must find the killer You know all details of the investigation You have access to your father's notes Nobody else has all this — They know nothing anyway It is a very dull case — They have too much routine You have to look in some dives Burglars and bank robbers go to nice restaurants and the murderer can only spend time in some dive I know some places The point is just to go and watch I'll help you in this, you can count on me — Everything looks so simple when we are together I even believe I can trace the killer — What are you doing outside so late? — The pump has frozen, I had to go to another one — Can't your father bring the water? — My father isn't here — Wait, I'll help you — No, thanks — Wait, I'll help you Wait, don't run! — Mother! Mother! — What did you do to the girl? — I didn't do nothing, she just fell — You like harassing children? Who are you? — Go away! You're crazy! — Catch him! Police! Catch him! Catch him! Help! — People are expecting peaceful christmas — We're doing everything we can — This is not the answer! — I'll not tell you anything else — Apparently, a proof is charging some important personage — I know nothing about this proof — What is hindering the investigation? — We do everything according to the book — These are only excuses and generalizations Public opinion expects an overwhelming response — Who let these journalists in? — Superintendent's order! — I'll not pass the case to anybody Nothing will force me to do so — I give you my word that the murderer will be hunted with all our powers And that he'll be brought to gallows I will personally arrest him! — Regardless of who he is? — Regardless of his descent and position! — Long live Winter break! — Away with school! — Man, we are so in [---] It just struck 2 o'clock! — I know! I have my watch, man! — Come with me! — So this is this seclusion of yours? — Do you like it? — The place is rather gloomy — Doesn't it feel familiar? — No. How should I know it? — From the newspaper photos The first murdered kid was found here Where we just stood In summertime it's beautiful here You hear the siren first Only after the tugboat comes from beneath the bridge Sit down Just think... It arrives in Gdansk in two days — Somebody is standing there — I come here always when my father nags me I hoped once that the killer finds me here — Come on! It's just six months! Wiktor, think! In six months somebody else will watch us sailing into the main river from behind that bridge — Close your eyes! — And open my mouth? — No, eyes are enough Look, now! — Wiktor! You're smashing! The real sailor's knife! — Look, it has a skewer for knots two blades, a screwdriver — Wonderful! Now you close your eyes — Ok — Your hand... the other way So you don't need to rely on the siren — But... I can't accept this It's sure very expensive — It's done. And let's not talk about it. — Bernard, you have no clue how much I like you — We'll be the best crew that ever took it to the seas Isn't it right? — Look, a wonderful two-mast boat comes your way — Yes, a brigantine — Good afternoon the intendent asked me to tell you that you have lunch without him I'm here just for the moment, thank you to pick up something from the office. Hello, Wiktor! How is school? — It's a Winter break now — I need to take something to be photographed your father gave me keys but I don't like to pick through the locker — I am not allowed even to get near — Sure — It's enough that I enter this room for my father to make a scene — I didn't expect it to be this small Just like a toy, isn't it? — I never saw a real revolver this close — A revolver you can see in the drawer, it has a drum This is a pistol, caliber 0.6 — Can you kill with such a small gun? — Of course! With exactly such a gun that killer is killing children — And... It's enough to pull trigger? — Do it — It's so easy to kill a man — It's very easy — And he shows them that toy... — Yes — He approaches from this side and shows them the toy like this he kills at very short distance It gives him pleasure... a contact with a helpless, trustful victim then he walks by and draws the gun behind the back and puts it to the head — Will you pull the trigger? — Don't pretend, I know you aren't sleeping Waniek was taking something from the locker Where are the keys? He left them in the lock — I don't know. I am not allowed into your room — You're lying! For some time you poke through the papers in my desk despite you're forbidden to! Where are the keys? Would you get up when I'm talking to you? — Bernard is going away for Christmas his train leaves in forty minutes let me say a farewell to him — I told you that at 10 you have to be at home I can't remember to be changing my mind — But he's my best friend! I can't remember to be changing my mind — But he's my best friend! — I forbid! — I beg you, let me go! Just this time! — How dare you insist when I told you NO! We will talk tomorrow! — I don't want to talk! You won't get it anyway! — I'll show him! — Sit down! — What's up, gentlemen! — This squit is eavesdropping! — It's Jarenko, he's deaf! — Let him not stare at me this way! — Put your nose in the mug! Or I turn you out! They don't like it when you stare at them! You got it? — We try to contact you for three days! We agreed you report to me every day! I was clear about it in last debriefing! You made out your task I think — He says that nothing interesting... The harbor... small traffic... In pubs... nothing interesting... — I will decide what is interesting — Stepek — What's that? — The name... It came up during talk He doesn't know the first name... ... a seaman ... he works on a ship — Write exactly what they were saying — "He smashed her nose" ...? "but he paid well and said to come again"... Is that all? — It's dark in the pub, he can hardly see people's lips — It's not much for three days Tomorrow at 3 o'clock — What are you laughing at? — Mr Intendent has a competition Your son is serious about tracking the murderer He was in the pub yesterday, with a friend — Fool! My son going to the pub! — May I get in? — Please! Stop here! Check if that Stepek has a record If not, check in seafare offices — He's young, so has good health! No matter how cold it is, he comes here every day Let's drink one! — You have a guest — What do you want? Strangers aren't allowed here — It's not that you stop everybody! — His father let him come, so it's not up to me — His father? Did you talk to him? I talked or not, it's out of your business Do I have to unleash the dog? What is it? You're leaving? — I will leave my easels with you. I collect them later Your father is over there... he followed you If you don't want to see him, come with me I'll walk you through the shore — What are you looking for, sir? — I am waiting for that boy — That boy? He left long time ago — I am standing here all the time, I'd see him — Maybe they took another route They went where they wanted — What does it mean "they"? — His father. They went through the frozen canal — Stepek, Stepek... what's his first name? — Unfortunately, I don't know — We'll check everybody with that name — Maybe I'll do it myself — The name can be misspelled It was conveyed by a deaf man — The name can be misspelled It was conveyed by a deaf man — Both upper shelves and half of the third are for S Here you have the directory — Give me 4312 — No answer, there's nobody at home — You didn't wait enough, try again! — That Stepek doesn't have a record I only found a Genowefa Stopka's file — Hello? — Still nothing? — Still no answer, I'm sorry — The deaf man could have read it wrong — Thank you What is it? ... brawls ... ... fencing ... ... prostitution ... — I doubt if there's anything for us ... prostitution ... — I doubt if there's anything for us — I'd like to ask you about something Just that it's private matters and you can refuse — Go on, Mr Intendent — You will take a car And check if my son is at home I just can't get through We'll catch up at Bednarska Str. 7 — I wanted to tell you yesterday I even came to your door but I didn't dare I know who lets those journalists in — I know Thank you — Gentlemen! It's Herman! I recognize his car! Follow him, he wants to sneak out! — Somebody was knocking? — I don't think so... — Leave the bottle and wait in the staircase! I told you not to tinker with the gramophone! What? You'll get nothing, I paid rent in the morning — I am not a bailiff I am here just to talk to you — Gienio... throw this guy away! — Oops, Mr Intendent... — Gienio, take your duds and get lost! — It's a cop — You still operate in attics, Gienio? — I don't know what are you talking about, Mr Intendent — So, what do you want? — I need your husband Where is he? — I have nothing to do with that scum You can look for him if you wish — But Mrs Stopka... you are getting into trouble Serious trouble... At least 2 years for fencing... For prostitution you'll get blacklisted... This kind of tenant is not welcome even if they pay rent You'll get evicted, and it's wintertime... — God damn you! Let the plague come on you, you fuckers! I told you I have nothing to do with him I mean it! What do you want to frame me in? — You got into it by yourself On September 14... — You fucker... He reported it... — He didn't need to report Neighbors can see everything — I had to show hime I could do anything if he's not leaving the kid alone Give me a cigarette I swear to God I didn't want to kill him When he... ... returned from the military He was sort of broken Not good for work, neither for bed He used to keep quiet for a whole day He got up from his pallet only to beat me up Son of a bitch He knew I had to endure — Maybe he suspected the child to not be his own — Maybe he suspected! the real cop you are! He was enough to see that much and he was ready! Don't come here! Stay in the staircase! Wait... What if he didn't report that? Why are you asking me all this? — Mrs Stopka, you are able to manage every man But did you really need to spill the boiling water on him? — Did I have to wait till he kills my child? He only waited that I leave to rough up the little guy! — It's your business now to prove he's still alive and we need to see him to believe You knew his friends You knew places he was going to I wrote the phone number and address here You have time until tomorrow — Wiktor is not at home I also went to Pirets' place but their son left for the mountain resort It's a Winter break now — They deal with marital issues! Instead of looking for the criminal! It's fearful to let children out to play! My mite... My sweet angel — Wiktor didn't come for the rehearsal today — Excuse me — Christmas Eve is in two days, Mr Intendent And you promised calm Christmas to the people Why are you so upset? Everybody must earn the living This time you will not send anybody to the gallows You became victim yourself It's a good title for a piece... Murderer's third victim! You should resign, you have lost! Please, hit me, Mr Intendent! I'll get extra money for the Christmas! Hit me! Go on! — Where have you been all afternoon? — I have choir rehearsal on Wednesdays — I asked where have you been, not where you should have been — I cannot tell you this — It means that you did something you're forbidden — Other fathers don't forbid so many things — I care not for others! Your father is guarding law and order! People look at you in a different way than they look at your pals Say something! I want to talk to you Didn't it come to your mind that I could be worried about you? — That's why you started to spy on me? — Excuse me for this — You wanted to talk to me — Sit down — I got it from Bernard we exchanged gifts for Christmas — You should not accept such expensive gifts you will not be able to repay him with anything of this kind They will demand me to resign at any moment The press will nose about any lapse I'll be attacked by the newspapers They will try to destroy everything I was struggling to build all those years Please try not to cause any more trouble Don't go to any pubs Don't investigate by yourself I am happy for mutual understanding That's why you return the watch to Bernard — But father, he is my best friend — Nobody's giving such a costly gift with no reason — This is friend's gift, you cannot demand it from me! Please, I'll do anything but this! — You will... even before Christmas There are matters in life that need to be ultimately solved! They need courage, I believe though that you're brave enough Needless to say, you will not see each other — It's impossible! — You break all contact with him! starting from now — I'll not do it! You cannot demand this from me! — Give me a break! [singing about a child being murdered in the park] — What bloodstains? Gentlemen! What are you talking about? It's paint! I swear to God, it's paint! I was painting cages for my rabbits! — You're lying! — 3 months ago you didn't have any rabbits — What did you do on October 9 in Zarzecze? — Strike me dead if I'm lying, I have never been there! — You've been seen there! — I checked all shipping companies on this river Nobody hired him in last 3 months It's impossible that he sailed anywhere in the area I only found a record in St. Lazarus hospital "He seeked help on Sept. 14 with burns on left side of his face" He left after being bandaged — We have the guy reported by the deaf — Take him to my office, and check the record — I made much better with military headquarters "District Recruiting Office" Excuse me Look at the "penalties" section — 14 days of close arrest for mistreating cart horses Stopek was a mechanic He served in car workshops — If he hid somewhere in a barge to wait through the Winter... We'll not see him before the ice breaks — What is it, Mr Intendent? I am finished with the tobacco! — What tobacco? — The smuggling of tobacco from Gdansk I did it only once! "Checked — no record" — We are interested in this man you must know him — It's Stepek — Stopek. Juliusz Stopek — Juliusz? They called him a "Kitten" anyways — Because he's so nice? — No, it's after that toy — When did you last time see that Kitten? — About 3 months ago. He was a stoker in Rusalka — Where is he now? — They say a woman poured boiling water on his face So he is not into showing himself — Nobody has seen him ever since? He had to make a living, work somewhere Somebody must have looked after him You said he was bringing women? beating them up, and then paying them So they wouldn't report? — I said that? — Four days ago in "Retman's" pub — How do you know that? — We ask questions, and you talk about Stopek So what was he like? — A mischievous and cowardly bastard It's enough to yell at him that he shits himself — Did he mention his wife, his child? — He had a child? He never talked about it — You must have seen something or heard about his attitude to children — Do you think so? That Kitten... those children? That's impossible... — Why impossible? — He's a coward! — Cowards can murder, too — He respected children! — What do you mean? — He like them, he even gave them toys He torn a photo of another mechanic's son that he put over his bed that the kid wouldn't watch naked ladies — What did that kid on the photo look like? — Like... I don't remember! — If I lock you up for couple of days your memory gets clearer! — A blonde, curly hair 6 or 7 years old — One more question That nickname... "a kitten" or something It's after a toy — Exactly! It's after this toy! He bought a lot of this from a mariner in Gdansk He thought we was going to make a business but nobody was buying — Move it! move it! — Are you maybe sailing to Gdansk? — No, we're on a way to Wloclawek for grain ... take it on a second platform! [Speaking in German] — Fuck off! — You're Polish! — I told you to leave! — I'll go now, but I wanted to talk to you — Fuck off! What is it? Make it quick! — You're sailing back to Gdansk? I'd like you to haul my boat I have some money, I can pay You only talk to the skipper — You better get out now for when your father learns about it... He'll skin you alive — I don't have a father, I have nobody — You're dressed too well for an orphan Your old man must have made it hard for you that you intend to escape how much do you have? — 3.5 Million Polish Marks maybe it's not much, but the boat isn't big neither it's moored in the wreckage area I can show you there — I expected from you better understanding of the situation It was supposed to be the "war in the news" not the war against the press — Mr Governor, these seized articles were just brutally attacking the police created resentment was making the investigation impossible! — We were talking about this a week ago I thought you understood about what resentment I was talking about I didn't mean resentment against police or against some officers I am sure you will revise your decision regarding the seizure — I understand, Mr Governor — And, regarding the press You promised to the community that you catch that murderer before Christmas Christmas Eve is tomorrow! — I never did any promise like that it was invented by the grubs from "Kurier" — I am not interested by your opinion about journalists Public opinion, however, is based on the press And the press demands radical advances! This case is not a local news anymore The whole country is disgusted with the murderer's impunity! — We put all our energy into this investigation And no external pressures will make it faster! — You must have got me wrong There is no pressures to speak of, Mr Intendent You are respected as an exceptional police officer and criminologist I am myself a supporter of your writings regarding maintaining the death sentence It would be a big harm for all of us if you became a prey for the public opinion You perfectly know what it's capable of — If you expect me to resign my answer is: no We maybe differ in understanding of "public opinion" but I promised to the community that I catch the murderer And I will do it even if I had to sacrifice all my life or conclude the investigation on my own And no power exists that could release me from this promise — We have certain trace, Mr Governor Juliusz Stopek Many traces lead to him as a murderer He is hiding somewhere for last 3 months We issue warrants even today! — Many traces... Congratulations, gentlemen! The public opinion will be very happy to see the photograph of the murderer in the uniform Thank you, gentlemen Connect me quickly with Warsaw with Military Police Headquarters — I only need the photograph — No! It's our only chance — Yours. I cannot cover you anymore I know the message I will find in my office — Give me just 3 days... 2! then I renounce the investigation — I must leave, unexpectedly. I'll be back after Christmas I wish you all the best! Merry Christmas — Here are these gentlemen — Good evening — I'm intendent Herman from investigative department, and detective Stefan Waniek We're on the case of the murdered children You must have heard about it, doctor — I'm shocked with this murders Are you following any trace already? — Exactly. We'd like to ask you for help, doctor On September 14th You were giving first aid to certain Juliusz Stopek — It was the day when they brought that German stoker from 'Annelore' You remember, doctor, stabbed with a knife It's here, the surgical register — Yes, I remember now... Burns of left part of the face He didn't come for changing the bandages — Does this kind of burn leave permanent scar? — It depends on treatment In any case, after 3 months the scar is still visible — Exactly... Finding the murderer depends on you very much, doctor This is Mr Grabski, he's a painter Is it possible, with your help that he marks on this photograph the scars or disfiguration of this part of the face which has been burned... It's the only possibility of issuing warrant right now — Only approximately... Only if Mr Painter familiarizes himself with professional literature And looks at some similar wounds... — We need it today, hours matter in this case — Has that burned fireman been discharged yet? — His family will take him tomorrow morning — Please, follow me — It's not allowed to smoke in here — Excuse me — This are gifts for the poor We have many unemployed patients — You are going to spend the Christmas Eve at your son's — Our son is in the cruise We didn't see each other for 2 years — I am sorry about this, you told me already Would you have anything against that you and your wife spend the Christmas Eve together with us We'd be very happy to host you at my house — I am sure that my wife, same as me will like the idea very much — Thank you very much I just recalled something important Excuse me now, I'll be at home — I'd prefer something else — What age is your son, Madam? — 14 years old — We'll find something in no time! — Here are examples, look at this Winettou... Here... Chaplin... — Sir, do you have Ricky Costello? — Ricky Costello? Of course! Here he is! Ricky Costello! Wait, we'll have a try Yes... Here goes moustache Show yourself to daddy now to your mummy — This is really ingenious! — Sure it is! — Good that you came earlier today, sir You have the food prepared for all 2 days You just have to warm it up and eat! — Dear Katarzyna, I just wanted to ask you to stay I invited guests for tomorrow — There will be Christmas Eve? — What's so strange about it? — There wasn't Christmas Eve for so many years... My son-in-law will wait for me on the station — Katarzyna, please! — Wiktor? Why don't you go to buy a Christmas tree? — A Christmas tree? — Yes, a Christmas tree! I don't know how much it costs This should be enough. And get some baubles, too — Good evening, Mr Intendent at home? — He's is here — I've got it! He's done a good job! — Not bad! — The shirt is overdone, I don't like it! — It's okay, he covered the uniform this way Make copies and send them to all newspapers It will be published tomorrow What is it? Are you okay? — Julius! Where are you? — What happened? — Do you know this man? Come here, downstairs — You fucking brat! I told you to stay away! — You have to flee!

They'll issue a warrant tomorrow You'll be all over the newspapers! You are suspected of killing those children! You are being traced for a week now — What are you talking about? — My father is police commissioner! He is leading investigation — Does your father know that your here? — I didn't tell him — Do you think I murdered those children? — No! I don't know, sir — You are afraid, aren't you Why did you come? — You promised to take me to Gdansk If they arrest you, I won't be able to leave — You really want to leave, don't you Your father is a policeman even at home — Where to? — I left my bag upstairs, I have a hat and a coat for you I will hide you in a good place It's only 2 days, you sail off after Christmas — Sit there and move not! [singing about a child being murdered in the park] — Repeat the address, please — Like I said, Sadowa 13 — Give me your name, please — It isn't worth checking out, it must be a joke — I told you, we'd check every report And no shoot-outs, I need him alive Intendent Herman speaking — We're here, in Zarzecze, there's nobody with this name in here — Too bad, come back to the HQ — It was true, he even had a scar on left side of his face except that he was 62, and on a wheelchair — Intendent Herman speaking... — It will only begin tomorrow... It's Christmas Eve today, people have no... — You will never catch him! Never! You have to resign! You're compromised! Compromised! You have to give up! — Don't put it back! It's Herman! Check the connection with my desk! — Just a moment Are you there? — Sure I am! — You're connected to the post office no. 2 with the public phone — Connect me to there! Quickly! — It's public phone service — You just connected a line to the number 4800 Who was on the phone? — A boy, with a student's hat I knew it was a joke He ran away, even didn't hang the phone Yes, I remember... He was dressed in a fur coat Are you there? Hello? Are you there? — Thank you — You are bold... What do you want? — Is it you here? Next to my mother... May I have a shot of vodka? — I have only one glass — It's okay We often drink rum from one glass, with my friend The old mariner's habit — Here — You shouldn't have come to me today with this Christmas Eve is not a good moment for this kind of things — I need to know everything about my mother before I escape — You don't like your father — He can't bear it that I have my own affairs, or friends who I appreciate He is a bad man He killed my mother! — Your mother committed suicide! — He's driven her to do it! — Your father is a good man! And you are the only one from whom he can expect love! And he needs it a lot, particularily now — No! I will not stay at home He will never agree for me to go on a journey I will not give it up He never wanted to understand me — You wanted to be considered a grown-up Drink up! To the last drop And now listen... You go back home And forget everything that happened between you two And put the photograph back in place She caused too much pain to your father She was egoistic She was looking around for people who would assist her in making it to the world You read my letters so I don't need to remind you that I disappointed her It was rather me who is to blame for her death I disappointed your father, too — We'll never reconcile He will not change his mind He never does Something extraoridinary would need to happen Something that would break him Third murder maybe — Dare not even to think about it! He is your father! — I'm not afraid anymore This key is my advantage — You're drunk! Wait! It's Christmas Eve today It's a gift for you I painted it for you — My solitude! You knew I was going to come — Sooner or later you must have come — He must have run out of money I didn't know how much these things cost — Maybe a bit of cottonwool will do it will make up for snow — You're right! Look! Here is some frippery from last year! — Mr. Teofil, everything is so well prepared that I could become a hostess tonight — But... That would be abuse of your courtesy — My pleasure! You can't disappoint your children They are waiting for you! — Thank you so much... I wish you all the best! Good bye! — Thank you — A bullet hole Shot from a small distance They'd be happy to see this one in the laboratory Almost intact... — He must have got the drawer open When I lost the keys The drawer was unlocked all day long — Boys like guns, you know — I'll skin him alive... — What counts is that he didn't get hurt — Where have you been? I told you the guests were coming! You were drinking! We will talk later! But remember... I have almost run out of indulgency You were at the rehearsal in the church — Good evening — The missing one! At last — Excuse me for being so late, but the rehearsal lasted so long... — I wish you all the best, Wiktor lots of success at school — Thank you, all the best for you — Have your dreams fulfilled, Wiktor — Thank you, all the best for you — This is a gift for you — Best wishes — The same to you — Dear Mr. Stefan... Best wishes — All the best! Everything will be fine, I wish you that — Thank you very much — This is a gift for you — Hand painted! — Very nice! — Thank you, Wiktor. It's really nice! — Soup will get cold And it's so tasty! — Katarzyna is a perfect cook! — You're right, she's a good housekeeper — Do you know who painted that picture? — Grabski, maybe? He's a skilled painter — Boleslaw Raster, former police doctor He's a very skilled man We understand each other very well He also loves sea, ships etc. — Too bad he's a drunkard vodka destroyed him — Aren't you curious of your gift, Wiktor? I remember when I looked in all nooks and corners for presents prepared for us for Christmas Of course, my sister couldn't keep it secret So it always ended up with sound thrashing — Really, I am so thankful It's so nice that you keep us company tonight — Wow, it's a great thing We looked at it in the shop, with my friend — Collect the plates! — I will bring the fish! — Wiktor will do it! You're the guest, sit down! — Thank you! — Look, what nice toys kids have these days! We only had lead soldiers and rocking-horses Look! It's cool isn't it? Remember who wore a beard like this? — Intendent Braniek! — Oh yes, dear sirs! — Please, don't touch it! — Excuse me — It is true what they write in newspaper? That if even one more child dies then they take the case away from you? — You shouldn't talk this nonsense they write there Especially at the Christmas Eve The supper isn't over, sit down! — Did you know? There's no ice on the river this Winter That tugboat from Gdansk was a real suprise! — How do you know it was from Gdansk? — Can't you see how he's treating me? It had a flag, and a sign "Danzig" — Ships from Gdansk don't have permanent agent here — "Annelore" has an engine with the power of 350 SH and top speed of 11 knots! — "Annelore"? — Exactly! Such a giant and they named it after a lady! — The stoker who was admitted to the hospital on the day when Stopek also arrived there was from "Annelore"... — Stopek worked as a stoker once — I will call for two men! — Wait... Mrs Helena, please excuse us It wasn't very happy Christmas Eve Excuse me for everything — I'll walk you home I have to be in the church in an hour, it's on the ay [Singing a carol in German] — Good evening Who is a skipper in here? — It's me — Police! Do you know this man? — It's Julius, my stoker — We want to talk to him — He isn't here He's got family in town — When did he go to town? — Yesterday — A boy came to pick him up — Where is his stuff? — Do you have a search warrant? — He is suspected murderer There is no time for paperwork — Gustav, you sleep there with the Pole show Mr Intendent the place This is his locker There's nothing in there This is his chest — I need to ascertain... What's this? A tool for sweeping the furnace Stopek used it on the ship My kids started to cry, and my wife said she would throw me away... If it weren't for you... I wouldn't come here for sure! — Thank you — Yes... I am sure now The fingerprints which you just brought and the ones we took from the toys belong to the same person — So... Stopek is a murderer! Thank you very much Go back home to your kids. Merry Christmas! — And same for you — At Stopkowa's place we found only Gienio No signs that Stopek returned home We did the search and interviewed neighbors — The skipper said that a boy picked him up — It wasn't Stopkowa's son. He has measles He wouldn't be leaving bed! — Stopek is in town! Let's observe all roads, railway station We'll search all houses... He can't escape! — There is only five of us! and a handful of plain policemen Everybody is at the Christmas Eve We have to wait till the morning — Wait... wait... wait... — What's that? — Midnight call It is Christmas already [Singing a carol] — Thank you very much — It is wrong if you don't give a dime — May Lord lead you — Thank you! — Hey, it's my turn! That's what we arranged! Why did you take it? — You got more! — I got more for I was reciting! And I sang better! — Stop bitching or I kick your ass! Who bought stuff to make the stable? — What's this? — I told you to not take him with us! With whom is he dragging there? — It's the guy who was standing at the gate, Ricky Costello — Do you know him? — I saw him there — We can sing something else this time — "Shepherds Came to Bethlehem" — What are the words? — Nobody can hear it, come on — Somebody was shooting — Just into the air! — People do it during Easter! — Jarek! Jarek! — These weren't usual rubbers... These were high snow-boots, worn over shoes Quite unworn, the sole mark is quite clear — We can only rehearse one of them... Mr Intendent... We can only rehearse one of these lads In his house The younger boy who discovered the body, is in shock The doctor didn't allow any contact with him — Photograph whole body first, and then the face — I'd prefer no questioning of him he's so frightened — You'll be present Sit down! — Where have you been when it happened? — We were in Rybacka street... leave me! — And you heard the shots over there? — Wladek had heard them, I was singing then The shot was very quiet... — What did you do then? — Mr Intendent... — We started to call Jarek We even ran to Chrzanowski's house I didn't feel like looking for him I was angry at him... So I waited Wladek went alone and... found him near the canal — Mr Intendent... I don't want him to be in shock like Wladek! — Excuse me please How did that man look? Did you see him? — Yes I did — How was he dressed? — He had that large green coat — Yes I did — How was he dressed? — He had that large green coat like anglers on the canal and snow-boots on his feet, worn over shoes — And the head? — A green hood! — Did you see his face? His eyes, his nose? — I didn't see him close Ricky Costello! Wladek said: Ricky Costello! — Whos is that Ricky Costello? — A crazy monk! He fought Spaniards in Mexico! — Forgive me, but I had to come — I see... Waniek will lead the investigation he knows the matters very well — Do you have any new clues? — Again... shot in the back of the head Same caliber gun, same small box ... with a kitten — Doesn't anything bother you? Until now... Stopek chose blonde boys as victims And now... — It must be a coincidence Are you going to town? Will you give me a ride? — Sure — I didn't get anything new from him That friend of his knows much more I'll try to get to him anyways — You will lead the investigation by yourself from now on The intendent has different assignment now You report everything in person — Mr Intendent ... You will be the one to arrest the murderer I promise it to you — Mr Skipper! — Stopek didn't come. I'll send him to hell! He's delaying ship's departure! — Who's seen him last time in here? How did that boy look who came for Stopek? — A nice blond guy About 16 years old dressed in sheepskin coat — Did he carry anything? — He had a bag with stuff He left it on board Was it this boy? Yes, I can recognize him. Although he's without glasses here — Too bad, I drank it all But... I wouldn't treat you anyways — It's cold in here — It's not supposed to be warm in here! — May I sit down? — Sure — I've seen you follow Wiktor — He likes to hang out on the river alone It's not safe there now — Did he come to see you? — I didn't want it — They come to you, despite you want it not From me they run, though I need them so much — You earn honors, medals, respect in scientific papers — Don't go... You were my only friend Only friend I have eved had Tell me, please — Only your resignation would change you It comes after one more murder — Did she hate me as well? Intendent Herman's Dismissal Why Intendent Herman Had to Go? Intendent T. Herman Dismissed — Sit down Is this a compass? — A marine compass — Do you know how to use it? — I do — Wiktor, I know what you feel towards me I can understand you in some sense I admit that I realized too late what happened I didn't understand some things, or I understood in a wrong way Wiktor, I would like to set it right You may still be friends with Bernard I have nothing against you inviting him here — He is in the mountains now but will be back after tomorrow — Good, you can continue your preparations for the journey — Did you know about it? — You forgot you father is a policeman I knew about it all the time even about you working on that boat — "The Champion", we'll fix it in Spring You have no idea how skilled I became I can use toold like professional boatbuilder — This if for looking at marine maps? — You need no tools for looking at the maps Sit here Look — Just a bit unsharp... — You didn't regulate it Look now — What's this? — Malacca — Malacca? — French Indochina And this... Sulawesi — Sulawesi ... — No, stay here. It's for me Please, sit down You must have your own remarks and decisions Please, tell me — For the first time I am here ... I would like to ... I don't know how ... It's really hard ... For the sake of our long collaboration ... And ... I'd really appreciate if you ... If you ... let me use the word "friendship"... — It's proper word, Mr Stefan I value so much your loyalty and your intellect You're an excellent detective And a noble man — I went once again to the tugboat ... I wanted to know how did he look ... ... that guy who came for Stopek It could not be his son — I know who it was I was there hours ago — That Ricky Costello, who fought in Mexico ... I thought that boy just babbled in fear He's a character in stories for children You maybe know ... — I have a son, Mr Stefan I was throwing that stuff of his to trash myself — I acquired of number of these stories They have illustrations I have them here in this folder Ricky Costello is in there It seemed so unlikely to me ... that I asked that painter who helped us with Stopek's photograph We made it to the hospital So Grabski painted portrait of the murd....... He painted a portrait of the killer according to the testimony of that ... boy who has seen him close These are the only copies I told the painter that the experiment failed and I destroyed rest of the sketches Can this be a mistake? Mr Intendent ... Maybe it is a coincidence? for God's sake! Mr Teofil! Tell me it isn't true I will anything for you Just give orders — Under whatever pretext, get rid of police posts between river's curve and wrecks' cemetery — Under whatever pretext, get rid of police posts between river's curve and wrecks' cemetery We will arrest Stopek there — Wiktor, I want to ask you about something Can you find my rubbers I used for angling? I will need them tomorrow I'll go to sleep, I got a headache Wiktor, wake up — What is it? — You were interested in the murderer of these children You even wanted to catch him yourself — It was a childishness — Wouldn't you like to be witness of his arrest? To take part in a real police action? — It would be really cool — You understand that young guys are normally not taken to such actions I wouldn't like the press to write any unpleasant stuff Do you know where the old wrecks' cemetery is? — Behind the timber port? — Exactly. We'll go there separately Be careful not to be seen I will follow you closely — Wasn't it supposed to be here? — No I have an impression I was here before ... — You really don't recognize? You know it from the painting I gave you — Oh yes, the Christmas gift You know it from the painting I gave you — Oh yes, the Christmas gift The same gloomy house in the backdrop — Please, forget about it — Excuse me, I have already forgotten — Will you signal beginning of the action? — Yes. They will flush him from the port so he will run through here — But he will turn away when he sees us! — When he sees a man and a boy he will not get suspicious — There is no policeman to be seen — They are well hidden — I used to come here to cry because of you — Wiktor, I've forgotten so should you — Excuse me, I've forgotten, too — Cheer up Look over there Try to think it's your way to the sea — It's the "Five Whistles Curve". Do you know why? There is a shallow before the bridge The ship arriving from upstream Signals five times with the siren It means "Don't overtake" And then when she reaches this tip She has to give two long signals It's a signal for opening the sluice Dear Mr Intendent I know I lack courage to tell you about it so I am writing You remember that bullet we found in the book You said that Wiktor fired from your pistol cal. 6 I had that bullet examined It is identical to the one we found in the head of the child murdered yesterday And came from the same gun Please destroy this letter so it doesn't fall into wrong hands — Let them close the road from the river's curve — Should I go with you? — I am sure you know what to do Thank you for everything — Give me your gun, Mr Stopek — What gun? What are you talking about? — You have no chance There are your fingerprints on all those toys you left with your victims We found bullets and that rag in which you kept your gun on "Annelore" — You're spoofing fine ... some rags ... You must have found the gun, too, Mr Herman — The gun will be found It must be found so you're brought to trial for your murders Every murder must be punished Every murder Regardless of who committed it That's what people like me stand for — You shouldn't care for arresting me, Mr Herman Your son hid me here brought me food, clothes You will not be clean anymore when they write about it in the newspapers "Intendent's son hid the murderer" — Did you wear my coat all the time? — All or not all, it's finished — Did he take the coat and snow-boots from you during Christmas Eve? — He took them, but gave back after couple of hours a nice son you have brought up He persuaded me to go out and shoot some boy He said you'd be dismissed from the police force — I will help you I will tell you the escape route Under one condition That you shoot me — You must be crazy It must be a dodge! What do you want to frame me into? — I am giving you a chance For pulling the trigger I'll tell you where won't be police posts — Where is Herman? — He's around! We had to wait for him here — That Stopek killed his son He must have done this last night That damn toy was found with him and traces of the same snow-boots We must get him alive even if we all fall here Follow me! — Which way? — At the river's curve Mr Stopek! You must shoot me or I won't let you run — Don't move or I'll shoot — Stop! — Don't shoot! — Don't shoot! — Don't shoot! — What have you done! I said don't shoot! It was an order! — Excuse me — Excuse me that I have failed you — Malacca ... Sulawesi ...
