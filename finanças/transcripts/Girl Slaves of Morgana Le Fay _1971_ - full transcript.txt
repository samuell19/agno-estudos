Sacrilege. To abuse our hospitality To think unholy thoughts To steal the talismans To break your vows You have heard the charges... You have spoken What is your defence? Nothing. Punish me. beat me. Take away my perfumes. Break my mirrors. The sentence you already agreed to will now be enforced Stand up. We spurn you. You are no longer one of us Begone. Let me go. You don't exist... You are just lifeless ghosts. Your kingdom is not real It's not real. Do you hear me? It's not real! My first job... ...after art school... ...I want to draw comic strips With femmes fatales... handsome young heroes I can imagine. You dried up old philosopher It's hard being twenty Philosophy can be all or nothing - What are you drawing? - You... Running... I'm starting my comic book You're running through the forest, shouting Why? I don't know yet Look at this place... Like the Middle Ages. The place and the people Like nothing's ever changed Mulled wine, please Me too. And could you fill our flask with coffee? They're horrible, staring at us like that - What's wrong? Looking for a husband? - Don't joke. It's scary Drink and go. Turn back. Don't go through the village And hurry Why do you think he said that? Superstition? Who cares. Here's to holidays. And who knows - to love...? He's gone Right, we're off There's no one about I hope this is the right road So do I Taking the back road wasn't so smart Turn on the radio Dead. It was working fine a while ago Just a weak signal round here Perhaps. It's odd - What's the matter? - Haven't you noticed? Didn't you check the map? We've already been along this road I don't understand I'm sure this is the right way What now? Go to the next cross-roads Almost out of petrol I hope we find a garage soon Here again? I don't understand Dead...Nothing there. This really is the end Try again! It's dead It's cold Don't start crying But I'm really cold And it's so dark and quiet - I'm here, aren't I? We have to spend the night here?... I'll get our belongings. You try to light a fire Don't bother. It'll choke us Now we're in the wilds, you eat like a savage? We're women of the woods. I hope it'll be sunny tomorrow I hope so too What's wrong? Nothing What? Nothing You're looking for your friend? Come... ...my little slaves are sharing more secrets? Always complaining Haven't I told you often enough what I like? Now that's nice to watch To watch... The source of a thousand fleeting pleasures Yet how deep and intense Go and join them. Sit down. Make yourself at home Thank you. But... No buts. You've only just arrived I'm looking for my friend She's lost in the forest I know she'll be worried about me - She's like my big sister... - Now you're with me she needn't worry No harm will come to you here You're safe from the world But I must find her Best to wait here She'll soon find you All forest roads lead to the castle Really? Perhaps I should go back to that inn ...so gloomy You're friend isn't here This place... I don't know, but... ...since we left that inn and entered the forest it's like a dream... ...one of those dreams that seem to last all night Oh, you'll think I'm mad Why so? So many strange things have happened Things it's hard to explain As though everything was suddenly different... ...as if we had entered some fourth dimension The dwarf...the men in the inn. My friend vanishing...the boat All so strange Where am I really? With me But where? Isn't that enough? And the boat?...Is it some trick? Perhaps And the three women? You know them well? Who are they? I said: Sylviane, Sarah, Yall You don't want to tell me? Perhaps not yet And the dwarf, you know him too I know you do. You're tired Francoise. You need rest Come...don't be afraid You are not happy? Yet here am I, always at your service Who is it, each season, seeks out your...guests? It's Gurth...It's me Gurth...poor Gurth... Your torment will soon be over Morgane will be yours... ...and Gurth, you will be master. What is it? It's strange here And I'm worried about my friend You'll soon feel better I should go If I help you, will you act like a good little girl? You know something? I didn't say that That's good You see...Let yourself relax You live alone here? No...with my people "With my people" ...like the olden days? Yes. And I have some friends They live here with you? They have to live with me Friendship is a serious matter Just a moment, I'll be right back It's for me? Don't you like it? Very much. But it's an evening dress Go on, try it It's not really suitable for walking I have to go through the woods, back to that inn Why do you have to? I was sure you knew him They're ready? Yes, mistress May the food please your eyes May it suit your taste May it profit you They are faithful and useful Chosen for their beauty and loyalty Don't you agree only beauty and loyalty should rule the heart? Intelligence is always relative, whereas beauty, friendship - Like you and Anna... What's wrong? You said her name as if you knew it You told me about her I never mentioned her name I must have guessed it You know something. You must tell me. Always Anna. I'm sorry... But you have these girls here You told me they were friends I said they were useful... Friendship's nothing to do with usefulness Gurth, pour the wine And love? I like this word. It's warm. It's soft Why do you smile? The way we're talking, reminds me of student days And beauty. Life should belong only to beauty That's why you should live forever That's a bit much No. Because you are beautiful Now that I know you, I would be sad if one day you should die You have a cure for death? Perhaps... What do you think? She speaks wisely Her eyes are clear Her body is young And you, Gurth? I asked you a question. Look at her She is beautiful, mistress Is that all? Intelligent too Is she the one?... Liar Night already? When we sat down it was mid-day Here times passes according to our wishes I wished for night You wished for night? Perhaps I have magic powers I don't understand I should be showering you with questions Everything is so strange Are you afraid? No, no. I follow logic That's the worst sickness Here you can be cured of it You're already on the road to recovery I will explain to you the boat... ...the sudden night... ...the forest where you were lost All the many things that trouble you Come. The perfumes of the Orient may supply what logic denies you Is it a hookah? - Yes. Have you ever tried one? - Never Draw gently and hold the smoke What a strange feeling A mixture of tobacco and essence of roses If Anna could see me now Tomorrow one of my servants will take you to your car Leave us alone now Alone with her? Ought we to? Go now. To your rooms Not going to the party? One day you'll be sorry I think he's in love. - Sad lover who knows no jealousy - Off with you. How soft your voice is The air is silky... Anna sleeps with me in the barn... I am two...me and another She is looking at her She takes her hand Francoise is in a trance Morgane loves her lips She is leaning over her Will she forget about us? Take her away Send the servants to get me ready. Hurry. Gurth finds good guests You must be pleased with him, mistress Hurry up. Give us time, mistress. We're almost finished Aren't you happy? We seem happier than you We'll soon start the ceremony All is ready? All is ready, master Gurth You know very well you are forbidden to watch Give me the casket. Help me. I can't take any more. They're trying to drive me mad. What do you want of me? Have you thought about my proposal? Do you accept? Do have another suggestion? - So, is it really that difficult? - The price is too high But I give much in return Immortality and beauty are not enough? How many women would already have agreed? Quick. Speak to her Do you want to eat.... sleep with these crones? To suffer their jealousy, their hatred of your youth... The way they torment all newcomers? Do you want to live with these damned souls? You are afraid? Do you accept? I don't know... Please... Hurry up. Accept...and you will receive eternal happiness Death is for the old and ugly Here you will forget the word exists From tomorrow an eternal today Whosoever enters here can never leave But don't be afraid. No harm will befall you Don't fear for your soul We are not devils... That is something invented by man to scare man Here you are in another world... ...a world of enchantment Of magic... For we do exist... Morgane, our mistress, gives you a choice If you refuse you grow old with the other fools who doubted You will end up as dust Accept and become one of us An initiate among initiates You will be a spirit I'm thirsty Listen... When I have finished you will give your consent Today I give up my soul... ...so you may continue our magic work down the centuries I receive in exchange beauty and eternal life I solemnly promise never to leave your kingdom... ...never again to seek the cold light of reality... ...never again to speak to humans I agree to all you say, I beg, I implore Wait! Don't answer in haste Remember... ...if you lie you will be banished... Thrown to the old women I agree Now let her drink Today...today is the love feast If you are here, do not resist its call You are here because you were born to be Give me your soul and I will give you light You come to me, as to the mountain, because you were summoned Give me your earthly thirst, I will give you inner peace Give me your strength, I will help you conquer all For your forgetfulness, I give you a key to the greatest secrets of all Give me your book of hours, I will open up the gate of spells You want something, my pretty one? Now you are one of us... - Mistress, Francoise has gone. - Francoise is here? Come... keep her here Charming little fool, you thought I'd let you go? Go on, tell me more... She is looking for the boat In vain... They will soon come for me... The water is deep... She is still searching... Now she is at the water's edge The boat is bewitched I have to swim across The water is like ice. Farewell, Morgane. Once across I shall be free Exhaust yourself, little siren My lungs are bursting My muscles are giving up... Swimming is hard All is quiet... No-one saw me escape Now she's in the forest... Leave me now With all this running, you must be thirsty... Don't you want to rest a while? You can't do this. I hate you. Little bird, if you try to flee the cage... ...you'll hurt your wings Each tree, each coppice, each log is a bar that guards my domain How pale you look You've been running all day long... ...for nothing Did you think I would let you go? If you want I will teach you my magic I will build for you a palace of ice Show you how to make a rose bloom from a dead log How to get wherever you want at any time If you like, I will teach you the language of the birds... ...of the wind... ...of the sea If you want, I can teach you so many things... It will soon be night They are walking slowly She is almost out of strength Morgane is talking to her softly What's she saying? She is making promises How her hand strokes the new girl's shoulder Our mistress is taking too much care For once her promises may not be lies What if Morgane replaces one of us? Over my dead body She'll never take my place. We could speak to Gurth... Yes, that's an idea. I feel we are stronger now than ever We can be rid of both Gurth and Francoise Perhaps it is still too soon It is time to visit the mistress Wait in your rooms! Tonight she sees no-one Why this sudden change? Come. Which of us do you want tonight, mistress? I want to be alone Are you expecting someone? Who did you have in mind? No-one... Francoise, perhaps How dare you. Are you jealous? We are What unspeakable audacity. Get out I'll speak to him You seem sad Leave me alone That's not like you Is it Morgane? We too are sad We deserve better than this You have charge of Francoise... Why not let her escape? But the talismans...? Everything's changed since she came Francoise is scared of Morgane But...we can help And the talismans...? We could look the other way... Just this once Don't you think? Don't scream. - What do you want? - Do you trust me? I don't know Could you? How? I don't know you... I'm a prisoner here Morgane is not evil No, but she's cruel... and you love her So what? She makes fun of you. Humiliates you You're nothing to her She is the Mistress now, it's true But one day I will be Master Then no-one can steal her love from me... ...not even you I'm not interested I just want to get away That's why I'm here You'll help me?... That's my plan Listen... Yael, Sylviane and Sarah guard three talismans With them you can break the spell But how? Tomorrow Morgane holds a great feast Sylviane will wear the necklace Yael has the tunic in her room Gurth has been to see her She's still afraid of Morgane... It must be done now, before it's too late I'll deal with Francoise You can help me And the topaz globe? I'll bring it with me. I bid you welcome, mistress... The mistress will be here soon Why do you look at me like that? Can't I admire your eyes? How long have you been with Morgane? I don't know... I've forgotten For ever, perhaps I think you're beautiful Morgane won't like that. You are perfect You please me greatly That makes me happy Come... What is that? Go and see See what befalls those who displease me Don't worry. You will never upset me I bid you welcome, mistress Will you read it to me soon? It's not finished yet It never will be. It's not fair, she always wins Not this time. Why...? It's good to see you again I was so worried. Now we're together, everything's fine Yes, we'll be all right here Yael has promised me I can draw... We're new here Right now the others seem a bit distant But they're nice You can't want to stay here. A promise is a promise I've promised nothing. Did you not swear the oath? You must have... What did you promise? My soul - the same as you did You've been staring at her a long time I used to know her...once - She really loved you? - And you destroyed her. It was her punishment She broke her vows You are cruel. I'll stay...I'm fine, really... I have never been so happy before It's wonderful... ...to want for nothing I do as I please Everything is fine I'm happy Please, listen to me - Gurth will help us escape We must go, Anna You can have all the books you want You can write It's pretty here, don't you think? But what do you like here, the luxury? The luxury? Look...it's what I've always wanted We are in the kingdom of the fairies A place only children can find Where everything is possible Please stay You'll say nothing? Nothing? To Morgane... About what? You see? There's no problem Anna is one of us You can see her as much as you want She is still your friend Let the feast begin. - This celebration is in part for you - For me? And for Anna, she has given me much Indeed she has Tomorrow you'll see my kingdom Tomorrow? If you want... You seem very sad Why should that concern you? If I must stay here... ...can we not be friends? Morgane is very jealous We're doing nothing wrong No, of course not Do you think that... Listen... Kiss me again, and again, and then Give me one of your most delicious One of your most amorous I'll give you back four, hotter than embers Do you complain? I'll ease your pain By giving you ten more of the sweetest kind Mingling our oh so joyous kisses We exult in each other's pleasure Thence forward, an alternate life shall ensue Each in himself and in his love will live Allow me, my love, these few moments of folly I always suffer when living chastely And could never be yours completely Without these few forays outside me Who's she? Louise... She has lived here a long time - Do you like this room? - Would you like to change anything? - No, it's perfect May I? Please don't touch... What is it? A special talisman You are everything to me mistress Say that again with more feeling You are everything to me mistress Now he is getting personal Because you're in my heart I'm like a dog and you are my master Dog, indeed! So, down, Gurth! Be my dog Perhaps one day I might bite ...mistress Try and stay amusing, if I tire of you... One day... Come on, say it No, not yet. It's a surprise Sarah, fetch Francoise You never hear me when I speak That's all I hear. - Well, one day... - Quiet. You begin to bore me - One day, Gurth...me... - Enough. Well?...Come on I will surprise you by becoming your master The necklace. It's been stolen. Francoise has taken the tunic. How could I have known? Forgive me. We've been deceived We'll sort this out later Francoise, I know you are here You see us, but the tunic renders you invisible The necklace gives you power over the boat... But without my topaz globe you can never leave the forest Now you are my prisoner. Come back and I will forgive you Or else... You were to be a princess... and you still could be Come back How else can I ask you? Don't you know who I am? If you refuse...you'll regret it. Which of you is to blame? Well, Gurth? It's him, I know it It's him, I saw it It's him, I sense it I set you free. You know what you must do You have not the right. There's the law. I am the law You thought you were master? You shall be Master of beggars. Master of tramps See how kind I am? For you I have a special sentence For having given invisibility, you shall lose your eyes For telling the secret of the boat, you will lose your tongue For having shown the way, you will lose your legs She is listening. See how she thanks you... she does not come to save you Take him away! Francoise! You can hear me can't you? When I catch you I shall drink your tears. Now go. At last. I have to get back. She knows I've gone Not so loud, she'll hear - I must help you - Listen! She is playing with us She has not kept her promise Even if you give up now... she will kill me When things cease to amuse her it's always the same I cannot live without her. And you cannot live here I will give you this ring. It's my ring of life Thanks to it I've lived a long time. A very long time Without it, I will die But dying now will be a blessing I can't. But I want to die. Not for you, for Morgane. Thus will I escape the cruelty of those three I can't do it I don't have time to persuade you... With this ring you must touch the log... ...near where you leave the boat My horse will come for you He will lead you to the portals of the human world He will take you across the border of the real and the imagined Call Morgane! I will plead for you. It's too late. Take the ring. Quick... Take it. No, Gurth. I'll wait here for them. They won't harm you Quick, something's happened We must warn Morgane Keep the tunic on Your desire to return was enough for me to find you...
