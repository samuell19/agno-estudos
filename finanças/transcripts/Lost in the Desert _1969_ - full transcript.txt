Last night I found a thousand birds' eggs. Me and you, too, will find. - Not Bad. It's not too much you like it? I'll find us something better. - Take it, take it! Now it is necessary to kill. I think it's better if you kill him. Come on, you do it. Let the leaves. He's too skinny. - And What You Can Eat - Anything that he usually does not eat. Sorry, sir, but I'll tell you - it the only way to survive in this region. Perhaps there is even snakes. - But the serpent will bite him! - We need to take a long stick, And if he finds a snake, you kill it with a stick and eat. - There are a lot of things that could be use, but he does not know until he sees. - Damn! Ouch! They bite! It's delicious! - Eat it, Lolly. - You have to eat, it is delicious, Eat immediately, even people eat it. Come on, Lolly, eat! Tonight we scrambled eggs!

Goes aimlessly, so can be circled and circled ... - Yes, but why in the south? - Well, first, if it will turn on west, then gets into the red desert. Then he will certainly die. In the white desert he can find food and water. But not in the red dunes. There's nothing. - And there are no people ... - I quote - "I love you very much and I'll find you." I know I've read about this sad fact, but all this has been going on for so long. Do you want to get up on this? - No, I support him. - Why are you doing this? To make it available to the public or to save the life of his son? - I do not think he wants to go public because of the leaflets. - He gave us exclusive rights to his story. So tell him that at first he enters the news, and then you ... - But ... - And I'm not going to write in the newspaper "Love Story", only to PR your pianist. And tell him. - Jack, sell all my possessions. No, the newspaper took back his promise, sell all that I have and .... tell as amended, to start typing. let's scattered leaflets from the air. "I love you and I'll find you." - You stay here. Lolly, get back! - Do you think that he is still alive, Smitty? Sir, we have to believe.
