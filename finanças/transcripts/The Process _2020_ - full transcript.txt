They wanted me to put them onto my engineer in Boston? - Yeah, something like that. - Dog, I work hard making these connects and I'm not going to let them come fuck it up. - I remember sitting down when you used to record in that raggedy old studio downtown. - You remember that? - Oh man. Yeah, y'all cute. On the real though, Sin, it's hard for these limp rappers to see you out here chasing that bag. You got to move in silence. You can't trust nothing but the process. - Def. Def. But yo, what you getting into for the night? I wasn't trying to ruin anything for you. - It's all good homie. My girl coming through later. You didn't think I was just going to slide off without having something to come home to? - Damn. And then I thought you was looking out for me. Sacrificing a night. Not getting some. - Take us to my house. - All right. (car's engine roars to life) (car whooshes by) - Hey. You up? You wanna grab some breakfast? - Oh, shit. I can't believe I did this. I don't know what I was thinking. How did I think this was a good idea? I mean, I'm sorry, but can you just get out? I don't know what I was thinking. - This is fucking crazy. You know you're the one that came up to me last night, right. - Just get out, Sin. - Nah, keep the sweater 'cause when my first album drop you're going to want to sell it on eBay. - That's the problem with you. Always thinking you're the only one with a damn dream. Everybody dreams. Some of us just aren't delusional. You're stuck in the city just like the rest of us. (scoffs) (slow instrumental music playing) - What's going on? - [Male Voice] How you doing? - I forgot my charger. - [Male Voice] All right. - Give me one second. - [Male Voice] Hurry up.

I have a little stash. (laughing) - The situation calls for it. (upbeat hip hop music playing) - So my pop's lost his job, Winston got his whip taken and Sin got robbed. Fucking hell of a day. - Bro I really might go fucking steal a bike. (B and Sin laugh) - Fuck a bike. Your ass too pussy to steal a car? - The hell is your ass talking about? - I'm saying like you'd be winded on a bike. (Winston laughs) - The hell. Shut up. Pass me that. - Hey, yo.

Damn, what the fuck happened to you nigger? Yo, you good my G? - Nah, yo. These niggers fucking jumped me. - What? - These two dudes that I sold some shit at the party and then... - Bro, how much did they take from you? Bro, that wasn't something I could just front you. I hooked you up. I put my trust in you. (loud clattering) Fuck. (loud clattering) (upbeat instrumental music) All right. I guess I can't get mad at you for getting jumped. That'd be some real sucker shit if I did that. - Yo, I know I fucked up but I'ma get you back. You have my word. - Nah. Don't do nothing stupid. You've all ready done enough. Especially trusting these slimy ass dudes in this city. I'm going to take care of that. I got you. They really did a number on your face though, huh? - Man I ain't even gonna lie. They def did. But there was two or three of them though and you know I got hints. - Man, you be luck to ever leave a party with a girl now. I don't even think Haydee would take your ass home any more. - Fuck her. I'm done with her. Saying I got fucking pipe dreams when she was the one that came up to me that night. - Yo, you gotta be careful catching feelings out here. Everybody's out for their own. No matter what. It's like, you can be with a chick but the moment you stop stimulating her even just for a second it's all over. All right. Yo, people like to talk about love, you know, I mean unconditional love but that real love that's something that's hard to find. - Hey, told her she can keep my sweater and sell it on eBay so when I become famous. (Reggie laughs) - You're a real cocky motherfucker, you know that. - I was just trying to help her out when she dead broke in a few years. And plus I'm gonna open up for Naz soon. - [Reggie] Nigger word? - Word. There's this showcase out in Providence. See who the best rapper is and I know am gonna win that shit. - Yo, if you do that, that'd be huge. All right, listen man, don't worry about this sucker shit out here. Focus on getting yourself ready for that showcase and I'll take care of it. I got you. So how are you getting out to Providence? - Well, this dude Winston was supposed to drive us up there but his shit just got repoed. - No, don't worry about that. I'm gonna take you out there. - Word? - Yeah. I got folks out in Providence. It's no problem. - Good lucks my G. - You already know. - Appreciate that.

(Hem chuckles) - Where you been hiding? - I'm not hiding. I go to school here. Do you go here now? - I did last semester. I took this semester off. Focusing on my music full time. - You're still rapping? - Yeah. - That's awesome. I remember back in middle school you always said you were gonna be Mr. Big. (Sindel and Hem laugh) - Middle school don't take me back. - I know. Right? So we should get together sometime and catch up. - That'd be dope. Let me get your number. (soft bass music) - Yo Sin, what's Gucci? My girlfriend waiting for me after class. How nice. - Brian, shut your tall Dave Lee looking ass up. - Backpack Brian what's up? (soft instrumental music) Text me. - Yeah. (Brian chuckles) Come on man. (slow instrumental music) - What's up bro? Excuse me, I didn't expect you here. - Yeah, thought I'd come by real quick. - Oh Yeah, it works actually. I got a couple hours. What you trying to bang out? - Word. I got two ready to record. Some of my best shit. - Dope. Dope. You email me beats already? - Yeah, the thing is I ain't got money right now. - Okay, so how's that work exactly? - I can pay you back. You know I'm good for it. Can we work some sort of like credit here? - No disrespect homie but I can't spot you studio time. I mean, it doesn't work that way. Know what I'm saying? I got bills I gotta pay. - Come on man. I've been loyal to you. I need to record these two songs that showcase. - I get it but you know, business is business bro. So, I mean if... Call me. Keep in touch. This is crazy. It never ends. (train tracks rattling) (wind howling) (car roars by) - I'm starving mum. - Well, if I knew you're gonna be up this early I would have made you breakfast. - Damn yo, I haven't seen you up this early since I'm gonna get buff phase. (man chuckles) - I'll be right back, honey. (teapot whistling) (hip hop music playing) Hey, sorry about breakfast. I didn't think you'd be up that early. And I'm not even gonna ask you about your eye. - Mum. - What's up with you? - Nothing. Just been writing a lot. - Yeah? How's it coming? - Good. I just need some place to record. - I'm sure there's a place close by. How's Haydee doing? - Rather not talk about that. - Fair enough. I was just wondering, because I never see her around anymore and you fill me in like never. How's Winston and Brian? - They're good. I Just feel I'm walking around in circles with them sometimes. - Being serious. You got some good friends. I wasn't that lucky growing up. You know, you may feel like you're walking around in circles. That's because you're the center. The center has to keep moving. And your friends, they got your back and you know it. - Yeah, but sometimes I wonder if anybody believes in me not because they know me but because they truly believe in my talent. - As long as you believe then what else matters? And plus, you're my first born you don't ever have to question my belief. (siren wailing) Oh, yeah. Ask your brother about Mr. Davis. The hall monitor. I read something in the paper that he has a little studio downtown. Maybe you could record there. (upbeat hip hop music) (soft electronic pop music ) (car engine humming) - What's up superstar? (feet pattering) - What? - You ain't gonna get the door for me? (Hem chuckles) (Sindel laughs) - You know, if I just got that door for you that would have made this a date right? - Wait, so this isn't a date? All right. - Where are you going? (Sindel chuckles) - Chill. You look so sad. - Shut up and put your seatbelt on. (upbeat pop music) (waves crashing) - [Sindel] Damn, I can't believe you've been hiding up in New Hampshire all this time. - [Hem] I wasn't hiding. - What was it like growing up in the woods? - Not everywhere in New Hampshire is the woods. - Says you. - No, I lived in Manchester which is a city (Hem chuckles) But we did live on the outskirts of the city so, - See. - Okay yeah, I guess it was.. - Yeah. I told you. - I told you. - Okay, yeah, it was the woods. It was the woods. (Hem chuckles) - Why New Hampshire? - My dad, he had a business up there. He worked as a mechanic. So I helped take the calls and keep the books. - That's what's up. I can definitely see you do that. You was always smart in school. And to tell you the truth I used to cheat off you. What? - That's messed up. - It's the truth. (Hem laughs) (Sindel chuckles) So how come you came back to Lin? - My dad, he got sick so. - Whoa. How's he doing? - Well, he passed away so. - Damn. (waves crashing) (wind blowing) So what was it like living outside of Lin? - It was really cool. Me and my dad had some really good times. - Yeah? How long did you live up there for? - Just less than a year and that's when he got sick. - You've been back ever since? - No. My dad left me some money. He wanted me to go to college so I ended up towards Field State. - Oh, for real? - It was a lot of fun but it didn't last. The money only lasted about a semester and a half. - So college, that's your dream? It's a step towards it, yeah. I wanna be a teacher. (both chuckle) - That's good. Everybody remembers their teachers. - That's for sure. That's for sure. I mean, I definitely had some awful ones but there were some really great ones that stuck. (both laugh) - That sucks. - So what about you, Mr. big dreamer? - Me? Just trying to make it out the city I guess. - Why do you wanna leave so bad? - I Just Feel like there's nothing here for me, you know. - I disagree. I think there's a lot here for you. - Oh yeah? - Oh, yeah, I do. - Like what? - First of all, me, I'm here. (Hem laughs) But seriously, your family, your friends, your people. Lin is where your people are from. - Yeah, but I'm a rapper. They're not gonna help me. This city doesn't support the talent. - Do you remember when Antonio made it all the way to the National Championship game? Do you? - Every single person and their grandmother was watching. That's support right there. - Yeah, but you don't think they wanted him to fail? Too bitter to see someone from their own hood make it out. - I don't know, Sindel but I do know that he had the city watching him. Listen, you gotta learn to embrace where you come from. Because it's one of the only things in this life that you can't choose. (soft instrumental music) (man breathing heavily) (soft instrumental music) - Fuck. (metal clunking) (feet pattering) (siren wailing) (dramatic music playing) - Fuck. Shit. Fuck. I can't believe this shit man. - Bro, shit is fucked up. - You can't let that shit just sit on you though. That nigger has some enemies. - Yeah, but he was really looking out for me. I need a smoke or I'm gonna fucking lose it. - Man I ain't got any bud on me. I'll let y'all smoke my emergency stash. - Nigger hit someone up. - And who's paying? - You. You're the only one with bread. - Yeah, cause I got a fucking job. That don't mean I'm supplying y'all weed. Plus my car just got repoed. - Bro, stop being a bitch. You acting like I never smoked you up before. - Who's being a bitch? - Both of y'all sounding like bitches right now and I ain't trying to hear it. So for the sake of the night Winston buy some damn fucking weed. - Man I ain't even trying to smoke. - Fuck outta here. You just trying to act tough. - Who? - You? - Man fuck outta here. - My nigger watch your tone with me. Today's not the day. Yeah, you ain't got nothing to say right? - Bro, stop trying to act like we gotta cater to you or some shit. Like you big time. - Bro, the only reason you feel some type of way is because you're not on my level. (Winston chuckles) - What level is that? - You wouldn't fucking know you electrician. - Yeah you right, I am a fucking electrician and I still spend just as much time in the studio with as you. You a full-time rapper. That's a fucking joke. How you can't afford weed. Let alone studio time. - That's how you fucking feel, huh? - Yeah. That's how I fucking feel. - Motherfucker. - Get the fuck off me. - Yo, what are you doing? - Man get the fuck out of my house. - You mean your basement. - Fuck you. - Chill chill. - Man, get outta here man. (thunder clapping) (soft instrumental music) (rain pouring) - This Reggie shit got me all fucked up. - I feel you man he didn't deserve to go out like that. - Fuck that. He wouldn't want me sitting here bitching he would want me in the studio grinding it out. (Mexican music) Yo, he was a crazy ass dude. I know he'd snap on me If he ever saw me sulking like this. - He was a wild boy. Unpredictable as a motherfucker. - I thought for sure he was gonna kill me when I told him about me getting robbed. And Pete, tell me how this dude came at my ass right? Saying I'm not gonna be able to pull any bitches with this shit. (Winston chuckles) Motherfucker. - Yo, remember when we was in middle school and we seen him smoking at the courts in the middle of the damn day. - Yo, this dude was smoking before smoking was even cool. (Sindel chuckles) And his kick game made me want to get every there was. - You know how like niggers know how to lace their shoes to make them look even better. - What? - Like bro, he knew how to lace his kicks to make them look even more fresh. I don't know how to explain it but I know your ass knows what I'm talking about. - Yo, I got this crazy idea for a hook I want Dennis to sing it. - For real. He def can sing, that would be lit. - Hell yeah. Me been thinking about having Winston spit on it. - Finally. It's been mad long since y'all jumped on a song together. You boys gonna kiss and makeup before that? - He'll be fine after I send him this beat. (bell ringing) - Mary better have that hog you owe me. Mr Gonzales you have the ripped jeans again. (indistinct chattering) (feet pattering) Alec great game yesterday. Suzanne, let's put a sweater on. That shirt would not be allowed in most clubs in Boston. (soft bass music ) - Mr. Davis (bus engine roaring) - Sindel. The ghost from high school's past. Here to try hard in every subject or are you here to tell me I was right and you needed to believe yourself a bit more. All right. (Mr. Davis chuckles) That was a bit preachy. - It's all good. - And what do I owe the honor to this visit? - Well, I heard you got a studio now and I can really use the recording time. - I do. I do. How come you never come by before? You were always rapping during your tech years. Listen, come by today after school let's say Four thirty sharp - Word? All right. Thank you so much, Mr. Davis. Appreciate it. (soft instrumental music) - Sin, my man, Brian isn't here. - Oh, all right I'll come back later. No you can come in and wait. He'll be back in a couple of minutes. - It's all good. I'll be back in a few. - That's stupid come in. (clock ticking) I ever tell you about that time I scored 37 points on Texas. Man, those boys couldn't stop me. Dunks, threes, pull ups you name it I scored it. But sometimes I think there's a Lin curse. - I do too. - You do? You think the Lin curse got a hold of you too? - I'm not gonna let it. (man chuckles) - And how are you gonna go about that? - Stay focused. - I like that but it's more than just the focus level. Man, I had all the talent in the world but guys went to jail way more than me. But game time came and I was the one with all the highlights. But that shit caught up to me playing pro ball. Everything is just different. You know, different food, can't speak the language. It takes a pro to handle that and still be able to perform. Now I know you rap but do you handle your rap like a pro? - I think so. I mean I try.Yeah. - See now you are thinking. Back when I was growing up everybody wanted out of Lin. You know, kids were playing ball, kids were rapping doing whatever it took or so they thought. Because all this is competition. At the end of the day that's what it is, competition. (door creaks open) - What's up? - Ain't shit man. Old head kicking some knowledge. - Only if people listen to the ones with experience. - What's good? - In the studio later. - Well I have mad homework. (feet pattering) - How I look fellas? - Good. - Good. - Where's he going? - Probably another job interview. - He's a good dude. All right I'm gonna head out. I'm gonna let you to it. - All right. - Hit me up later. - Yeah. (upbeat hiphop music) - Mr Davis. How's it going man? - Its about that day. - Hey you remember Dennis and Winston, right? - Of course I do - How you doing man? I didn't know I was getting the whole crew Run-D.M.C style. (man laughing) How you fellas doing tonight? - Just trying to stay afloat. - You're young ride the waves. (laughter) - It's a bar right there man. - Mr Davis man. (Winston chuckles) - You guys need me to rap? (Sindel and Winston chuckle) - Maybe. - You funny Mr. Davis. - [Derrick] Oh man. - Do you mind if all three of us get on the song? - Of course. The more Lin talent on the song the better, am I right? - [Male Voice] Hell yeah. - I emailed you the instrumental. - All right, I'll pull it up. - Cool - [Male Voice] Okay. - This is a nice space. - Thanks, Sindel. I believe the community needs more spaces like this - Of course. - [Dennis] This is nice. - All right, Dennis. I'm gonna have you go first. - [Winston] Let's get it. - Cool.

He was like five or six years ahead of me in school. - Yeah, great kid. Extremely talented saxophonist. It's a shame. He was much too young with a bunch of potential. - He played the sax? Told me he was musically challenged. - Even to his grave he tried to hide that he played the sax. I'm good friends with his mother. Actually, she was just here before you. - She makes music? - Yes. Does a lot with the church. - Damn. Well, he was gonna drive us up there to the showcase. It's a big opportunity. - Listen, I would love to drive you guys but unfortunately I have prior engagements. - It's okay. Well I appreciate the studio time Mr.Davis. Means a lot to me. How much do I owe you? - Not a thing, Sindel. You all have great talents and I just want to see Lin kids flourish. - I appreciate it. For real. (soft instrumental music) - Yo, Mr. Davis, thank you man. (phone ringing) - Yo. - Yo, Just begged my pops to let me cop the whip for tomorrow. - Word?

(soft hiphop music) - Man, fuck that shit. There will be way more opportunities like that. - I don't even know anymore. - What? You just gonna give up like that? Don't give up fuck that. Road blocks are road blocks not dead ends. - City curse or bad karma it gotta be something. I can't catch a fucking break B. - At least you're struggling through something you love. You still love rapping right? Listen man, you know I ain't no great role model but I fuck with you and Winston cause y'all my boys. Y'all got passion and drive. I try to have some of that shit rub off on me. - I feel you and shit. But this city I just feel like it keeps letting me down man. - It ain't the city bro. The city is the first big test. Once you conquer Lin the rest of the world's gonna be easy. - Hell yeah. - I love my pops but he gave up his whole hoop dream when he had me. He taught me the most important lesson without saying a word - Oh yeah, what's that? - You can fall flat on your face doing some shit that you hate right? So you might as well take a chance following your dreams. (upbeat hip hop music playing) (car engine roaring) I'll let you get the front seat. - You good bro? - Yeah am straight. - Another day another dollar. - Exactly.
