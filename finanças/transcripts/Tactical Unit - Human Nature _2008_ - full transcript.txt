On the right. Left, left, left, right, left. Left, left. Left the right turn. Dressing, right dress. Up move. Eyes front. Salute. God of Guan, who treated you like this? Bro Tong. Bro Hung. You escaped from the car. He blesses your whole family. How can you treat him like that? You have no conscience at all. What? Have you got enough frightening? Ask you a warm up question. Mathematic question. You've borrowed 500 grand at 80% interest, how much interest should you pay in a week? 5 grand. Wrong, it should be 28 grand. Sure. All banks and financial companies in Hong Kong count in this way. This is compound interest. How to say it in English? Why didn't you study hard? It is compound interest. We count the interest everyday. Do you understand? I see. How about that money? No. No? I give you another chance. Police question. If government finds that a serving policeman... has owed money of a financial company... what will happen? Don't make a mistake. You'll get punished. Remove from office. Remove from office? Don't you think I would ask you, if it is that simple? All people know the answer. He would receive no welfare and pension. Do you know that? Do you afraid? You should be punished. I want to do an experiment. Examine the hardness between... your head and this bottle. I skip this question. I take this then. I do it myself. Still thinking? Hurry up. I've to go now. Head is really much harder. We are now loyal pals. Though we born in different days, we are ready to die in the same day. Do bless us, God of Guan. Go. I have been a policeman for so long, but I never went patrolling without seeing God of Guan. This is an order from Commissioner. I heard that something bad had happened... in Kowloon East. You mean the case in Kwun Tong MTR station, two buddies were chopped by a manic? That's right. One of them had been cut off three fingers. And can't fix up now. Oh, no. I should have believe in other religions. We'd better pay attention today. After God of Guan was removed, Kowloon East grabbed a car theft group. And prevented a gold store robbery. Is it bad luck or good luck? Can you give me an explanation? We should do our work with or without God of Guan. Let's concentrate on our job. Yes, sir. Goods? Money? Bro, how about the money? Grab that all. Boss, how about the goods? Throw them away. You bastards dare to block my way. I will get you into trouble. How can he drive like that? How dare he make fun with we police. It is interesting. Keep honking. I will become more happier and happier. Fine. I will play with you. You tortoises are in real trouble now. Anybody hurt? No... Let me help you. Can't open it. PTU sergeant 26316, we have a traffic accident... in Pi Fat Road. Anybody hurt? No. But we can't open the door, call someone to help. Bro. Sergeant 26316, contacted Maintenance Department already. Arrive in 10 minutes. Bro Tong, where're you now? I am coming. Don't be lengthy. You think this No 5 of 1983 Macau Racing Competition... is only a name? Bro Tong, your head... What happened? 6 people were killed by guns. CID is now searching for evidences. What is on the floor? Heroin. Sam, found a Chinese identity card. Tong. Tong. Found a Chinese identity card. It seems a drug dealing activity. Somebody gains in the middle of dealing. Send this to CSI. Yes, sir. Tong... You haven't wore gloves. Yes, thank you. PTU, please handle all the money and evidences, to us crime unit. I will take over the situation here. Dismiss. Yes, sir. Log into this internet first. PTU the tortoise. No way. After it was uploaded in the internet for an hour, about ten thousands people visited there. Now all over Hong Kong, even the whole world, know that we PTU got into trouble. Our image had long grown in citizens' heart. But now all has gone. Sir, I am the sergeant of a column, I should take the responsibility. I should take the same responsibility as Sam. I am not asking for responsibly. Do you understand? I know this is an incident. Commander and Commissioner know about this too. I only hope that you can learn from mistakes. And never happen something like this again. You can still go patrolling. But maybe you will get into some trouble. Please do pay attention. Remember don't damage our image. Give me a well-written report. Yes, sir. Tong. What? Bro is waiting for you there. I said I will repay him when I have money. Don't make trouble with me. I have to go home. Bro said, if you don't go to see him, he will chat with your wife. Where is he now? That's great. You should add some beard on it. Add some beard will be fine. You too. Can you see there? Add some beard. You should add a little bit color, or it will not look like him. Go, Tong. Add this little bit. Your drawing is great. The main character has come... Let's give a hand to Uncle Fatty. What happen? In order to raise your fame. Don't make fun on me. Come on... come on... Let's give a hand to Uncle Fatty again. Did you paint a likeness of him? Yes! What about me? You painted a likeness too. But you're not. Chin up. He do has beard. Right? Do you know why we're drawing Uncle Fatty? No! Do you want to know? Yes! How about a question and answer section. Civic question, is it right to own others? No! How about owe without repaying? Wrong! You got it right. Is it right if Uncle Fatty borrow money from others? No. No. Hung, stop now. I have to take action since you didn't repay. Do you know what? Uncle Fatty is a policeman. A policeman without repay, is good or bad? Bad policeman. And this bad police lives in this estate with you. As a good citizen, do we have the responsibility to tell people not to do the same as him? Yes! That's right. Do remember his face. And don't act like him. Understand? Yes! Sir, what's his name? Good question. But according to the privacy law in Hong Kong, we should not announce his name. Or else we are against the rule. Just remember his face, and don't learn from him. We say goodbye to this bad policemen. Bye, bad policeman. Honey. Tong, I have made you some soup. I have a case. I will not come back tonight. Do you have enough clothes? It will turn cold tonight. Honey, did you see anything downstairs today? I saw you appear on the stage. Honey, I rent a room in the Summer Palace in Kowloon City. I will not return in these few days. I have transferred $3000 into your account. Honey, no need. I used all money to buy airfares. This is all I have left. I will take Dee to live with my mom in America. Don't go away, honey. Where are you going, honey? I will call you before departure. Don't leave me, honey... You will in charge of Jordan Road and Bowring Street. Recently, there are thefts and robberies. Do patrolling in the nearby buildings, balconies and back stairs. Wong Sir, orders from Superior. No patrolling now. Meet with the crime unit immediately. And give a statement. Sir, what happened? Some of the illicit money is lost in the case yesterday. Our team is being suspected? Not only you but all people had reached the scene, do have to be investigated. We are out of luck. Because we didn't worship God of Guan. Sir, we followed all procedures yesterday. And handled all money and evidences to crime unit. I trust you. But this is an order which all of you have to follow. Don't be worry, if you are innocent. Embezzlement is a serious crime. Superiors do value about the case. Be sure that you all cooperate with crime unit. Understand. Yes Sir. When did you leave the scene yesterday? 1630. Then we passed the case to crime unit. How much money did you find in the scene? I don't know. We didn't touch them. Besides PTU, is there any people has touched the money? You crime unit. CSI took something to make a test too. In your team, is there anyone looking for money or borrowing from others? I am not sure about others privacy. When did you find the money is lost? This morning. You found that? It's Wo. Any clues? You have no questions to ask me? I know you for sure, since we have known for ages. I am not teaching you. But you should follow all procedure. Or else, you shall take the responsibility. You are so great to your colleagues... since we were in the police school. We have known each other for 20 years. You haven't bought Feng to dine with me for so long. We are busy. How is Feng and Dee? Fine. You are depressed these days. Seem like very upset. Aren't you have lost some money? A little bit. Just ask if you need help. I can solve it myself. Don't hide anything. Have you touched any shit? Why did you disappear? Finance question, how much did Heng Seng index increase yesterday? About 100 points. It should be 300. I don't have money to buy. Since you didn't repay. That's why I've lost 100 grand. Bro, 50 grand only. Bring me another 50 grand tomorrow. I have given you 50 grand already. You fool. This is called "Punish interest". Financial companies and banks in Hong Kong do the same. You don't satisfy with it? What if complain to her. Madam, good afternoon sir. Good Afternoon sir. Tong, what happened? Nothing. Just asking for some clues. Do you need help? No. Madam, I do need help. Civic question, in order to promote relationship between citizens and police, what should we citizens do? We should buy a drink for the policemen. My treat! Yes, bro. Milk tea? Coffee? You don't need help? No. We are good friends. No problem of course. Buddhist question. What is "Nothing can bring away but sin"? Just like the case as Madam and I. She arrested me for three times. I escaped that all. That's why she keeps stalking on me. Got it? Hung, I will keep stalking on you... if you are keep messing around. Thanks for your advice. I will keep messing around, if you keep working as a police. May, wait for me. Make sure he will repay us. Bro, I got it. Sam... What do you think about the incident? Maybe this was because of negligence, maybe there was something happened in the middle of transportation. And there is the possibility of being theft by our colleagues. Who would arouse your suspicious then? All those who had been to the scene. How about Tong? He is just the same with us. When I was patrolling today, I found that he gave money to Hung. Are you suspicious of him? Hung is a loan shark, and Tong is fond of gambling. It is nothing strange if he borrowed from Hung. But it doesn't mean that he would stole. This is two different things. When a man is heading to a one-way, and he suddenly finds so much money in front of him, how can he make up his mind? You saw how he looked at the money. This means nothing. This is all your speculation, but not proof. I know. You do believe him? I just hope it wasn't him. I will never suspicious our men so easily. I got it. If it is him finally, what will you do? I am a policeman. If I find my close ones did violate the law, I will take up my responsibility, and arrest the criminal. Who is it? It's me. I place a bet. You dare to call me. We are looking for you. The match is coming. Do you take it? Damn. Of course I will. Race 2 No. 13, 14 in quinella, $2000 each. No. 13 win, $3000 each. Anymore? That's all. I will get 200 grand for it. Let's see. Hey... yes... roger. Summer palace villa. God of Guan, bless me. No. 13 gets the first place, No.14 gets the second. Bless me get both of them. God of Guan, bless me. That bastard has been betting for so many years, but never won once. Afraid for what? What the hell is it? It is so smelly. Nothing. Are you making fun with me? He is here just now... Don't make a noise... Take a chair for boss. Go... go ahead. Go... go ahead. Go... go ahead. That's right! You wouldn't find your money is lost. No, there is no difference between a thief then? I can't effort myself a meal. Just borrow me. I will return to you. Don't tell people I live there afterwards. I will know what to do later. Be assured... What's wrong? These Chiu Chow people has come for six days. Going in and out. I afraid that they will skip my rent. I pay for them. You pay? My own kind. It is fine. $200 a day. Total $1000. But they may not return to you. It's fine. We are all brothers and sons. We shouldn't bother about anything. No need. We have money. Don't make trouble for us anymore. I have to go to work... Give you back. My own kind. No need now. See you, my own kind. Hello? Fine, I come by now. Shek, how much money did you earn in Guangzhou? About $800. How about now? I can't earn that much money for my whole life. Thank you bro. Do you satisfy? Yes. It is no good to be too greedy. I am a simple guy. Just want to buy a few cars. We pals should be honest to each other. If you find any questions about money or anything, please do tell me. Or else, the consequence will be serious. I got it. Have you got anything to tell? No. Take a rest for two days. We will take action soon. I got it. Sam... Why do you ask me to come? Why don't you ask why I was beating you? You are my friend. You do have your reason. Tell me, what is the reason? You know what you've done. Remember what was the first sentence you told me.. In the police school? You said that you love being a police. I ask you once again. Do you love being a police? Yes. Chin up and be a good policeman. Ask Big Man to handle this. Yes, Bro. Lee Sir, what a coincidence. Good afternoon. Can I help? Fatty, coffee. Can I help you? I will take care of civil servants. No income certificate and mortgage. Just hand in a photocopy of your appointment certificate. And I will prove it in 30 minutes. How much does he owe you? Who are you talking about? How much does Lam Tong owe you? Sir, I can't tell according to the privacy law. How much does he borrow you? You want to help him. This is not a small amount. Tell me. Good pals. Altogether 500 grand. How to repay it? Cash, checks, or auto-pay? How much did he borrow you in the first place? How can I remember? Let me count for it. We offer legal interest. About 5% at compound interest rate. This is a mathematic question. He is asking me mathematic question. You handle this. Sorry, I'm quite busy these days. My colleagues can help. Bro, about 450 grand. 450 grand. I will handle that money. I will give you 20% more. You are good pals with him. But I am the creditor. I disagree with your approach. According to the basic law, you should repay if you lend money. You police should sure about this rule. If he doesn't have money, he can talk with me, but he can't run away. As a creditor, I can take legal action to claw back loan. Or else he can petition for bankruptcy. But as a policeman, if the police force finds that he is badly in debt, he may never be promoted and get into blacklist. And finally being removed from office. No welfare and pension. Have you talked with him? If you are good pals, talk with him then. Don't bother me. You leave now? Let's talk a little longer, okay? Good-bye Sir. Good-bye Sir. Bro Tong... Bad luck has gone. We found that this morning. How to get it back? A reckless guy dropped the money aside the cupboard. Luckily, the cleaner found that out when she was sweeping the floor. Though God of Guan has been removed, he do takes care of us still. We are of good luck this time. But superior said investigation is to be continued. What for? They afraid that someone has brought the money back. Troublesome. As long as we didn't lose the money. The responsibility is not on us. Let's follow the order. Roger. Tong. Hung, why are you here? I am just doing population census. How many colleagues do you have here? We plan to have a promotion... designated for you policemen. We will prove it at once. Furthermore, we have prize and P-2. Do you know what is P-2? You don't know that? Hung, what do you want? Don't play tricks on me. I am not playing tricks. I just want to improve your knowledge. P-2 is preferential interest rate. It's used as loan interest, got it? These two bastards seem looking for money. Hung... What do you want? What can I want? I have no money. I know, that's why I'm looking for business here. Is there anything wrong? Sir... Don't disturb me. I need money to see a doc. You dare to ask someone to scare me. I didn't. Am I blind? It's your friend Sam. He came to my company yesterday. And asked how much money you have borrowed. He said he would responsible for the money. You friend is a PTU. He is a frightening big guy. Scare me to death. I just met with the psychologist. He said I am suffered from panic disorder. And have to take medicine for a long time. Do you know which medicine is the most expensive in Hong Kong? It's the mental medicine I got to take. It costs over $40 each. How can I see the doc if I don't have money? If I don't take the medicine, my condition will go out of order. And I don't know what will I do. This is all by yourself. Can you help me? How can I help? You want me to ask them if they want to lend money? Do you feel difficult? I will break out if you feel that. And I will get into the police station whenever I break out. I will do what you ask. It's what you said. Now together with the interest... repay me 20% more. It's that simple. 20%? That is another 100 grand. You give this answer real fast this time. This is not much. Now it's you policeman threatened me. If I bring the case on court, I will get a 400 grand in Hong Kong, and a few hundred billion overseas. That's the deal. If Sam comes to me himself, I do congratulate you. He treats you as his friend, and give you a hand. If it's you who ask him to come, you are getting into trouble. Don't try this anymore. It's not only you police can look for me, We citizens can look for Commissioner too. Let's go. Our storage has installed a closed-circuit television. Sam, I need a reasonable explanation. Sir, why do I need to explain? According to this tape, you are suspicious of stealing illicit money. I just take my money in my own locker. Is there any problem? Why did you put so much money in the locker? Our office hour is strange. I was late to put it in the bank. You had a few grand on hand suddenly? Sir, this is the money which my friend had repaid me. I was late to put it in bank. So I put it in the locker. Sam, I hope that you didn't hide anything. No. Okay, I trust you. And this tape can prove nothing. I will not give it to the superiors. Thank you Sir. But be well prepare that... superiors will continue the investigation. I got it. Sam... Thank you... He asked Bro Sam to come by, I wonder what happened? It seems to be related to the lost money. But the money has already been found now. Superiors said the case is still continuing. Bro Sam stopped us to worship God of Guan. That's why he is getting into trouble now. We are of different teams. It seems that we are more innocent. That's right. You mean you are embroiled by us? You think it is done by Bro Sam. I didn't say this. But you do think in this way. What are you talking about? Enough now. Let's go. Yes, Sir. Sam, have a talk. What did Wong Sir say? Nothing. Does he think you are related with the case? The money would not come back by itself. I know you wouldn't tell. But I have to ask. Did you help Tong to do it? How could you do that? You should help your colleagues, but now you're perverting the course of justice. I know what I am doing. Sam, you are a police. You said if you know who did this, you will arrest him. You lied. May, this is not as serious as you think. I just want to help. But you should pay the price. I know what I am doing. Sam, I hope you will be fine. Stop... Stop. Stop... Madam good Afternoon Sir. Good Afternoon Sir. See what had happened. Are you okay? Answer what he asked. Wake up. I'm fine. Fine. Did he beat you? No, nobody beat me. I saw you were beating hard. Beat what? We are doing martial arts. That's right. We're doing martial arts. Madam, don't you believe us? We do it in front of Madam then. Are you ready? Ready. I am going to call 1,2,3 now. It's good for your health. 1, 2, 3... The spirit is much better than the red sun. Call Sam to come by. Yes, Madam. Once again. The spirit is much better than the red sun. Hello. We'll come by. Thief... Don't run. The spirit is much better than the red sun. May, Bro Sam hasn't come yet. Should we call the console? Enough. Madam, Basic Law allows us... to have passion towards martial art. It's fine. Hey, I am sweating all over. Goodbye Madam. Goodbye Madam. May, I'm sorry. You are really on time. Arrive when they've gone. A robber happened there. Got back to pick up? Just picked up some cigarettes. What a coincidence. A fresh big eye fish. Goose, pig intestine, and beer. Come by immediately. This should be my treat. We are not used to others kindness. We are of same kind. You love car racing? I love it. Me too. You too? I got No 5... in 1983 Macau car racing competition. You are boasting. I have joined the world's most famous competition too. Who won that year? A German driver called Stak. He drove the car ahead... ...a few cars. We just couldn't get close to him. And the Hong Kong driver Michael Lui got the second runner up. And I got the fifth place. Are you racing still? I'm old now. And this costs a lot. As long as I have tried in my teenage. You can't drive with this face even you have money. How dare you said this. I broke my head one day. I just hold the wheel in one hand, and dressed my head with another hand. Really? Are you that powerful? Let's have a match sometime. Of course. How to call? Tong. They call me Fat Tong. Bro Tong. Which occupation are you in? I was a security, but I am unemployed now. So you live in a villa. Right... You are not Hong Kong people. We are visitors from China. We will leave in a few days. Tong, you eat without repaying. Bro, aren't we taking the car? Bro, what happened? You hid it under the seat. I didn't. You're playing a fool now. Bro... This is none of my business. I didn't know there was money hid under the seat. Bro, I am innocent... Bro, please believe me. Shut up! Bro... I told you that you have to satisfy with what you have got. Didn't you hear me? Bro, I was wrong. I was greedy. I promise that I will never do this again. Bro... You need someone to drive for you, right? I will never do this again. I will never do this. Forgive me. If you admitted it that day, and returned all the money, I may forgive you. But it is too late now. No. You can't kill me. We worshiped God of Guan together before. You shouldn't kill your pals. You are such a faithless jerk. How can you in face of God of Guan? Bastard! Stand still. Stop running. Stop running. On board! Taxi! They have took a taxi, you'd better drive faster. Hold tight. They have lost us. I'm sorry. It's fine. You owed a lot from others? Just skip these things. You do drive well. I joined Macau car racing, and got No. 5. Don't you think I was boasting? How about your friend who love car racing? He has something to do and left already. Are we going back to villa? Yes. No problem, 3 minutes. Bro, someone calls you. I am not going back now. Please drive us to Man Wui Street. No problem. What a luck. Awesome. What are you doing? I am waiting for my friends. Do you have friends? Mathematic question, there are 7 million people in Hong Kong, what is the probability for me to meet you in this street? Got that? No... It should be 1. Next question, who should get beat? Me? It's what you said. Tell me, what did you owe? Tell me all your dirty things. You owe money and? And not repaying. That's right. And then? And then what? Hide everywhere. You worth a beat. Police. So what? Threaten me? No. Threaten me with a police? I will just beat you in front of him. Bro, a gun battle happened. A policeman is seriously injured. I come by immediately. Bro Tong... Bro Tong... What happened? There is a covert money dealer on third floor. There should be some dealing yesterday. And someone got all the profits in the middle. The robbers were rushing to the car, and met a PTU. They opened fire. The police was shot and hasn't out of danger now. Why did you beat him? Do I need a reason? Console, there are shots in Man Wui Street. Please provide support here. What did I do yesterday? You said you were drunk yesterday. Right. What else did you find? Nothing, besides shell cases. I look for clues. Call me if anything happens. Roger. He hasn't woke up still. Yes, I wonder his situation now. May, how is Kit? He got 3 shots. Lost a lot of blood. And is still in danger. Does he need blood transfusion? What if we call all the Kowloon West colleagues, and check with their blood type. The hospital will tell us when needed. How about his wife? She looked ill. She had sat there for a while. And now take a rest at home. Commissioner has come before. And said Kit is very valiant. Remember, we are now facing a group of bandits. We may meet them afterwards. Do be careful. I go to look for that bastards now. It's useless to be anxious. We need to match up with the track down procedure. We have to guard our position. Now, you know what kind of people we are. You are robbers. Why did you bring me to rob? I was embroiled in it now. You passed out that day. But we didn't leave you. I owed money. I was beaten to pass out. Did you owe a lot of money? This is none of your business. You are robbers... Fat man, it's enough. Don't be impetuous. Let's have a talk. I will move out. It's no advantage to get close to you. You've known so much. Don't you believe I will kill you? Let me go. I can help you. I can give you a million. I need a driver now. And I think you are suitable. Afterwards, you will give that one million dollars. You asked me to rob with you? I afraid that I will die with my money. Or else, I will be chased by the police in my whole life. I'd rather keep owing from others. You just in charge of driving, I promise your safe. How can you take care of me in that situation? We are followers of God of Guan. We treat our pals as ourselves. I said I can take care of you, then I can do it. In fact we are not normal thieves. We steal those filthy lucre only. And kill those who deserve to die. We have done two cases since we came from Mainland. First one is a drug dealing activity. After we got the money, we threw all the drug. I don't want them to poison our country and teenagers. Though we met some policemen outside the warehouse, we only shot to frighten them, and didn't kill them. Because we were public securities in China too. How about the last one? There was a covert money dealer. We robbed it, in order to prevent them from disturbing our economy. How about the policeman? Why did you shoot him? He is innocent. I shot him. We have to take care of our own life in that situation. Two days later, We will rob the national treasures smugglers. We may give you one day consideration. If you don't agree that, it is fine. We won't kill you. Please be fine. God of Guan, please do bless him. Do bless him, God of Guan. Bless him. I will burn you a few more joss stick later... Do bless him, God of Guan. Bless him... God of Guan. I will burn you a few more joss stick later... Tong. Sam? Are you familiar with Kit? No, I was having a statement with him. How about other colleagues? They got something to do. Kit hasn't woke up yet. How can you give him a statement? I had made a mistake. I'd better go now. Tong. Why are you so nervous... about the injury of a normal PTU? I didn't. I saw you faced the door, and kept muttering. What happened? But we are police too. Don't you know how many policemen are sent to hospital every year? Have you ever visited them? Tong, what happened? Nothing. I'd better go now. Tong... You really need that Fatty to drive for you? There are only two days left. I don't have time to find another one. Bro, you know how to drive yourself. Why don't you do it? What we need is a driver. He needs not only to know how to drive a car, but helps us to escape when we are in danger, so as to keep as safe. What if he doesn't agree? I will kill him and give up that thing. It is such a waste as we have prepared it for so long. Nothing can help. Not either one position or stage can get wrong. Nothing can succeed if we get one people less. I have observed that Fatty for a long period. He is easily affected by others. And the money he owes is not a small amount. I believe he will do it. How can a man reject a million dollars? We will divide that one million ourselves. Afterwards, he has to die still. Pay attention to the man in the file. Anybody can recognize him? He is Hung in Jordan. He is a loan shark. Right. He is Hung, Chan Yiu Hung. He was found, in the gun battle scene some days before. The crime unit is looking for him. He used to mess around in Jordan. Sam, May, you are in charge of Jordan today. See if you can find him during patrol. Yes Sir. He is the key person. He may help us to catch those bandits. I hope that you can find him out. Any Question. No, Sir. Get ready in 10 mins. Yes, Sir. Calling second column. Roger. We are on position now. We are now in Kimberly Street having vertical building patrol. We are nearby too. Keep contact. Roger. Roger. May, where are you now? Suen Yi Street. Hung is in your opposite road at 3:00 direction. Big Man. Madam, physics question, which one is faster? Car or human? How many bandits did you see? Three. You mean the three people who shot you? How many shots did they shoot? Many. Was there any car waiting for them? Yes. There was a car standing by. I saw Hung who is used to mess in Jordan... arguing with the people in the car. The closed-circuit television, also found Hung. We are now looking for him everywhere. You mean there should be four people, and one of them in charge of driving. It should be like this. I remember the one who argued with Hung is a little bit fat. Fat. What else features did he get? I saw his back only. Do you know the man? No. You said you heard they were arguing. Did you know what they were arguing at? It's too far away... I can't hear it. I only know that they were arguing. And even got into a fight. Lun, find out all fatty who related to Hung. I got it. How do you feel? You mean the fat guy who appeared in the scene? I think it may be Tong. Why do you suspect policemen every time? It is my speculation only. You know Tong and Hung used to mess around these days. There are at least a few dozens of people... who know Hung and is a little hit fat. I will call Tong and talk with him. Miss call. I hope it isn't him, but we have to find him out. . Hung- . Tong- You are great, I have to hide myself for you. Hung, it's none of my business. Your pals are real great. You have good fortune now. What do you want? Nothing. I just want to talk.
