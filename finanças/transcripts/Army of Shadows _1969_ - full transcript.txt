The war will be over for the French when they can see this great movie. I heard about Félix that same day. I still had a lot to do in London, but with his arrest, I couldn't stay a minute longer. I decided to return that night. You've never jumped before? No, never. Be careful when your feet hit the ground. Don't try to avoid falling. Bend your knees and roll. Understand? More or less. In my absence and after Félix's arrest, Mathilde had moved down to Lyon. She proved herself a first-rate organizer. I made her my assistant. The chief had told me she was a remarkable woman, but she still astonished me. She knows both how to command and how to carry out orders. She is strong-willed, methodical and patient. She spent days studying the layout of the Lyon military medical school, now Gestapo HQ. She learned Félix was in the cell reserved for those to be tortured. She wanted to breach the walls with explosives. She had to give up that plan for another one requiring various disguises. She found a new hideout for my command post. She couldn't have found a safer spot. My new host was Baron de Ferté Talloir. Ex-cavalry officer, needless to say. Before the war, I was a sworn enemy of the Republic. I organized my sharecroppers, kennelmen and huntsmen into a squadron armed with hunting rifles and pistols. I was ready to lead a cavalry charge against the local prefecture in the event of a Royalist uprising. His squadron, perfectly trained and organized, still exists and guarantees my security. The baron invited me to use his grounds as a drop point and landing strip. His wishes came true beyond all expectations. What a strange carousel! As one plane descended, another one just like it circled low over the field. The steady drone of its motor covered the landing and takeoff of the first plane, which then covered for the other. That night, in two operations, four men arrived from London and four others returned. Le Bison, Le Masque, Jean-François and Mathilde handled security for the operation. And your husband? Does he know about your activities? Certainly not. Neither does my daughter. That's her. She's 17. Don't carry it on you. You're right. I’ll get rid of it. Before we get back to what I don't dare call "routine" matters, we have to take care of Félix. He has no cyanide tablets on him. I’m not worried about him talking... but he probably can't escape torture. The Gestapo won't let you commit suicide. We have to spare him the suffering that could go on for days, even weeks. I’ve given it some thought. There are no two ways about it. - You found a way? We have to get into Gestapo HQ and bring Félix out. Mathilde, I want to save Félix, but I can't commit a combat group to such a desperate mission. Who's talking about a combat group? With Le Masque, Jean-François, and Le Bison, I should manage. And how? What's your plan? Le Bison, can you get us three German uniforms? - Sure thing, madame Mathilde. - Go to it. Our first obstacle is to contact Félix and let him know. I haven't figured it out yet, but I will. Félix has to be ready and waiting for us. I’ve been trying to reach him myself. You'd think a German architect built that medical school. You can't get in. - True, it won't be easy. It’s hot. Mr. Gerbier... I have neither Le Masque's courage... nor Le Bison's strength... nor Mathilde's daring. I won't take part in this mission. But I’m sure that Mathilde and my comrades will succeed. Don't try to find me. "Mr. Dupont, 6 rue du Boeuf. Saint Jean knows lots of things about the Resistance. " How did you manage? Oh... We'll only use two uniforms, Guillaume. I know, Madame Mathilde. NO ADMITTANCE You're not doing this without me. We're certainly not doing it with you. Remember what you said. "You have no right to sacrifice anyone. " Least of all when it's you. But that goes just as much for you. Now, about Félix - - May I? Two men - that looks normal. But three would be too many. When Jean-François was here, you wanted three uniforms. But at the last moment I’d only have used Le Masque and Le Bison. Jean-François... I trusted him. Me too, but that's not what I mean. I just never thought he'd leave us like that. Who is this man? The man denounced in the letter. You can go in. Naturally, Dupont is the only name you have. Naturally. What organization are you with? I don't understand. You know the risk you're taking? Being shot under a false name. Your fate would remain a mystery. I decided to leave that haven. Maybe I felt it coming. Three days later, the baron and his men were arrested and shot without trial. What is it? We're to transfer a certain Félix Lepercq to Paris to the headquarters of Obersturmführer Bömelburg. Yes, a terrorist. Hurry up. It’s urgent. - Get out. Wait here. An ambulance from the Paris Gestapo is here for a terrorist, Félix Lepercq. Notify the doctor on duty. Let him issue the transfer permit. Can you hear me? Mathilde, Le Bison and Le Masque are here. I’ll help you. Are you in a lot of pain? It’s no use. He’ll be in great pain... right up to the end. It’s impossible. I can't let you transport a dying man. I’m sorry. Very well. I’ll file a report. Félix, I have some cyanide capsules. Do you want one? We could have saved Félix. No one could. Not even you. Besides, you're wanted by the police. You'd better lay low for a while. Take the next plane out. You're not serious. And the maquis groups springing up all over? They have to be organized, trained and given supplies. No one can replace me for now. And if you're caught? Then we'd have to replace you. Police! So Germaine serves good food? Meat at every meal without tickets? Identity check for everyone! Get a move on! I’ll save it for later. He says to smoke quickly. They're coming for us. He could get in trouble. To each his own troubles. This is it. TRANSFINITE AND CONTINUUM Love has meaning for me only as it applies to the chief. He means more to me than anything. More than anything but less than life. If Luc Jardie died, I’d still want to live, but I’m going to die, and I’m not afraid. It’s impossible not to be afraid of dying. But I’m too stubborn, too much of an animal to believe it. If I don't believe it to the very last moment, the last split second, I’ll never die. What a revelation! The chief would love it. I’ve got to look into this more deeply - You will turn your backs to the machine guns and face the far wall. You will run as fast as you can. We will not open fire at once. We will give you a chance. Whoever reaches the far wall Will be shot later With the next group of condemned men. We can always try. There's nothing to lose. He knows what my legs want. He's ready for the show. His confidence shackles me more than my irons. Go! I won't run. I won't! It had to be timed perfectly. Thank Mathilde for that. We were well informed. And what if I hadn't run? Something wrong? Thinking about the others? No, about the officer who was so sure I’d run too, like a scared rabbit. Step on it! Isn’t safety great? You have enough for a month. The water's okay, but I’ll bring some wine. No, don't come back for a month. I’d better run. The car mustn't be seen here. Then run along. See to your arm and thigh. Don't let them get infected. - All right, Guillaume. You'll find a razor on the table. For three weeks I’ve been holed up alone like a frightened animal. I wrote a long report for London. I kid myself that I’m still of some use. I haven't seen Mathilde or anyone else. ESSAY ON THE PROBLEM OF THE FOUNDATIONS OF MATHEMATICS NOTES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ABSTRACT SET THEORY ON LOGIC AND THE THEORY OF SCIENCE AXIOMATIC METHOD AND FORMALISM My only link to the outside world are the five books Luc Jardie wrote before the war. They keep me company. At night, I’m haunted by Jean-François' disappearance. Le Bison? Or Le Masque? Is that you? It’s you? We have to talk. - When did you get back? - Four days ago. After Mathilde's arrest. We have to talk about her. We have to, Philippe. Mathilde was arrested on the 27th. She wasn't hurt. She found a way to let us know. The Gestapo discovered her real identity and her family's address. She was carrying her daughter's photo on her. You can guess the rest. The photo? Mathilde's only slipup. The Germans sensed it was that remarkable woman's weak point. The photo... How could she have kept it? I warned her. It’s extraordinary, Philippe. She begged them to give her back the photo. What? Mathilde sent us an SOS. They've given her a choice: Either she names all the agents she knows in our network or her daughter is sent to a Polish whorehouse for soldiers from the Eastern Front. Those are the givens of the problem. We must find a solution. She can escape. No, she can neither escape nor kill herself. The Gestapo is confident. The daughter will answer for everything. She can play for time. How much time? That doesn't solve the problem. Here’s Le Bison. Don't tell him I’m here. Go into the back room. I got you a new pair of glasses. The same as before. Ah, thank you. Any news from Mathilde? Well? - I don't know anything. What? I don't know anything. It’s all in the letter. Mathilde was released yesterday morning. Gerbonel and Arno were arrested last night. Is that right? If that's what it says. Le Masque... you knew about this? I’m not in charge of reports. Mathilde is to be eliminated at once, by any means. You can't be serious! I won't lay a finger on Madame Mathilde. I worked with her. She saved my skin. I watched her at Gestapo HQ. She's a great woman! If it was a man, whenever you say. As many as you want. But not Madame Mathilde! Over my dead body. Never! No arguments, Guillaume. She has to die and she will. You can't do that. We have other killers. If need be, I’ll do it. You wouldn't dare! You have no right! In the shooting range, you could've run like mad, but she saved your life with those smoke grenades. You mustn't do it. Let her sell us all out if she wants. She protected me. She protected you. Now it's her daughter. We can't judge her. That'll do! The matter is settled. If you're coward enough to do it, I’ll get you first. Stop! Get off me! You were still a kid when I was in the Foreign Legion! Think I’ll stand by and let you do this? Are you crazy? Back off before I kill you both! What we need here is a man who knows nothing about weapons. Sit down, my friend. Have a cigarette. It'll do you good. Right, Gerbier? You heard it all? You're right. Mathilde is a marvellous woman, more than you know. But we're going to kill her. - You can't. We can, and here's why. We're going to kill her because she's begging us to. She told you that? No, but it's obvious. Think for a moment. If she just wanted to save her daughter, she'd only have to supply some names. You know her memory. Instead, she tells them our agents keep moving around, that she needs to re-establish contacts. So she gets herself released. Isn’t that clear enough? Now put yourself in her place, forced to hand over your friends, and unable to commit suicide. I’d want to be killed. You think you're any braver or better than Mathilde? - I’m sorry. - Find a German car. Le Masque will drive. I’ll be in back with you. Are you crazy? I’m sure she'll want to see me. Don't! It’s no place for you. It’s an order. That wasn't necessary, chief. You sure of what you claim about Mathilde? How should I know? My theory might be correct. Or she wanted to see her daughter again, making it harder for her to die. That's what I want to find out. I have to be with you for the hardest part. You in a car full of killers! Nothing's sacred anymore. SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 1943 Go! Claude Ullmann, alias Le Masque, had just enough time to swallow his cyanide capsule on November 8, 1943. Guillaume Vermersch, alias Le Bison, was decapitated by ax in a German prison on December 16, 1943. Luc Jardie died under torture on January 22, 1944, after revealing one name: his own. And on February 13, 1944, Philippe Gerbier decided this time he wouldn't run.
