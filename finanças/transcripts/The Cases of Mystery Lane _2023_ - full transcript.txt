No. No, no, no. - Hey Tim. - Birdie. - Paula. - How'd the Lancaster call go? It actually got pushed 'til tomorrow. You let me know if you need any help with that. We're all rooting for you. I think I got it covered but I'll let you know. You got everything there, Paula? Always do. Just a heads up, the Lancaster call got pushed 'til tomorrow. Oh. They're stalling. Which means you've got them right where you want them. I know. I can taste it. Birdie, bird. I'm outta here. Gotta get that step count up. Oh, you're so good. You ready for tomorrow? Me? I was born ready. I'll tell you what, tomorrow I will get the coffee. Yeah? Deal. - The ushe? - The ushe. You know me. Of course I do. Hey babe! Okay. Deal me in, boys. Good evening. I'm Trisha Murata and tonight authorities believe a 30-year-mystery has finally come to an end. Just hours ago at this construction site behind me, workers discovered the body of famed Boston crime boss Orleans “Lean” McGuiness. McGuiness had been on the top of the FBI's most wanted list for over two decades. Well dumping him at a construction site has mob written all over it. Seems kinda cliché. Don't you think? This is real life. Not an article in The New Yorker. Oh. So you can read? Careful there, glasses. Most of us swim in these waters on a regular basis. You haven't even gotten your feet wet. Alright. Are we gonna finish class or argue about the news? Don't worry about him. The ability to use various equipment and technologies and a thorough knowledge of the law are some of the key skills a private investigator needs. Now, who can tell me what sub rosa means? Yes. Um, it's Latin for... It's Latin for... For under the rose. It's a... It's a term that investigators use when they wanna do something in secret. Alright. This week's assignment, it's gonna be a little more fun. Surveillance. Yeah. I need all of you to surveil someone from your life. A few rules. Don't get caught. Don't follow your wife. Don't follow your boss. And definitely don't follow your ex-wife. I take it you haven't told her yet. I'm working on it. So that's a no. Yeah, well... with Birdie, it's all about finding the right time. What are you afraid of? Inflation. Carcinogens. Murder hornets. Teenagers on skateboards. Pretty much everything. But the thing that I'm afraid of the most... is that look of disappointment on my wife's face. You could be an incredible private investigator. - Yeah? - Yeah. And I'd hate to see all that potential go to the wayside because you were afraid of disappointing your wife. I know. You have to tell her. I will. Soon. Soon is upon us. Huh? Soon. See ya. Oh. Oh, so that's how it's gonna be. I don't think you got it Lizard King 784. You're bluffing. Hey. Hey babe. How was class? Oh, you know, fascinating. We're learning all about bankruptcy. Oh. So you're on chapter 11 then. Uh, no. Actually, we're on chapter 4 but... I see what you did there. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Yes! Eat it. Eat what now? Oh. I, um... got you some new granola. - Nice! - Yeah. The one I like with the pistachios? Yeah. Uh huh. Did you get up to anything fun tonight? Oh, you know. Just, um... a couple of briefs and, uh, getting my Sudoku on. Uh huh. Yeah. Just a wild and crazy night. Actually, um... you know there's something I kinda wanted to talk to you about. Oh. Okay. What is it? I... Uh... read that, um... the article that you sent me. And you know what? I think you're right. I think I should be taking a daily probiotic. You read the article I sent you? Thank you. I know it's not everyone's favorite topic. Well... But if we're gonna grow old together we cannot ignore our gut health. I mean, the balance of good and bad bacteria are crucial. It's crucial. Crucial. Yeah. This initial offer is unacceptable, is just unacceptable. - Morning. - Morning. - Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oh. I made you a little breakfast. Your favorite. Um, I was hoping we could have a chat. This is so amazing but I actually have the Lancaster call this morning. Can I take a rain check? A rain check. Uh... sure. Great. Uh, well. But how about... a latte? I love this little heart. It's a little heart. Oh, you know what? Kyle... Kyle was grabbing coffees on his way in. But I feel so bad that you went through all this trouble. I mean, I... I'm gonna take a little sip. I'm gonna take a little sip. That's okay. - I'm totally fine with that. - Wait, I have to take this. Kyle! I was just talking about you. You ready to crush it? I'll see you tonight. Hey... You literally finished my sentence, that is exactly what I was thinking. We are so on the same page. Just make something up 'cause I don't wanna talk to him now. Yo! Yo, the bird looking sharp. You ready for this? Breaking necks and cashing checks. Thank you very much. Mmm! Cinnamon. Living on the edge. Game time. The case of famed Boston crime boss Orleans McGuiness continues to unfold. Police are now reporting that this is an active homicide investigation. And that's the news for this hour. Coming up, a rare B-side from the late Danny “Teardrops” Page. Paid in full. Okay, Gambot 200. It is time for you to go to your forever home. You know, I think you're gonna like Cincinnati. Terrible chili but the people are great. Godspeed old friend. Oh Kyle, your coffee's so great. Is that cardamom in there? Does everything you touch smell like unicorns? Our position from the beginning was to have this resolved in a reasonable fashion. We understand that. We believe 3.5 is more than reasonable. You know three million was our ceiling. No. Up, up. Now you have a new ceiling. Our client does not think anything over three million is in their best interest. That's fine. We can always see what a jury thinks. Fine. We'll make 3.5 work. Great. We'll send over the paperwork this afternoon. Dream team strikes again. Huh, huh? Yes! Where'd we land? 3.5. And on the first round. Yes. But didn't they start at three? Paula, can you get the champagne from my fridge? This calls for a celebration. Thank you so much, Tim. These paralegals. They file two forms, they think they're Erin Brockovich. Ms. Case? Ms. Perez would like to see you in her office in five minutes. Well, I guess, good news travels fast. As it should. She's gonna love this. This is how you make partner. I'm grabbing the expensive stuff. Uh huh. - Well done. - Thank you, Tim. That's how you do it. Thank you Leslie. Teamwork, right? Teamwork makes the dream work. We did it. Shut the door. What was that? This is not how you make partner. We got them half a million dollars over their ceiling. $3.5 million is a disgrace. 3.5 is fair. We are not in the business of fair. We are in the business of extracting everything we can until there is nothing left. Kyle and I thought that this... Listen... I like Kyle. He's a good worker bee. But making partner isn't in his future. It is in yours so long as you pull it together and start acting like a killer. But Mom... I am not your mom when we're at work. I am your boss. And I need you to step up. Understood? Understood. Krshnit? Oh... crushing it. 11:27 AM. Target said vehicle identified. Brotastic. Hey babe. Hey. How did the, uh... how did the call go? Fine. Was your mom pleased? My boss wasn't exactly thrilled, no. What's new? Um... hey, uh... so, uh... I'm thinking about, you know, going with some of the guys to happy hour tonight. Um... Hey. I'm out. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Those are gross. Uh, no. I'm good. Okay. Well, don't wait up. You know how hard CPAs like to party. Mmhmm. Okay. Bye. Dry cleaning. 5:10 PM. I'm Kyle. I like to do five K's just for fun. Goodnight, Tim. Oh, Birdie. Good night. I didn't think anybody was still here. You're taking off soon? Tonight feels like one of those nights I'm never gonna leave. Ugh, I hear you. - Okay. Good night. - Good night. Hey. Today was still a win. I know Eleonore can be tough but you did right by your client today. That's the best we can do. I don't know. Sometimes I just question it all. We all do. You just gotta live to fight another day. Thanks Tim, that means a lot. Get outta here. Good night. This is Tim speaking. A new suit. Fancy boy. My name's Kyle. I don't need to wear a seat belt. I'm Kyle. I work 18 hours a day. Three... Five... ugh. What the? Come on. Ugh! Ilm Kyle, I run out of buildings at full speed. Guess I'm going in. Hello? Hello? Barf. What's that all about? Divorce? Hello? Somebody here? Tim? Oh no! Oh no!! Freeze! Let me see your hands. It's not what you think. How do you know what I think? Yeah. Eww. Ah. Your blood pressure's a little high. You been under any stress lately? Slightly more than usual, yeah. Mr. Case... let me get this straight. You followed a Mr. Henicker, Kyle, back to the office because you were "doing homework" for your "private investigation class" 'cause he bought your wife "coffee". Did I miss anything? I don't appreciate your liberal use of air quotes but aside from that, it's correct, yeah. Alden? Oh. Are you okay? Yeah. Is that Tim? Yeah. Wait, what are you doing here? Err... I... Say something. A few hours ago Tim was giving me some really kind advice and then I got in my car and I drove home thinking that my husband was out networking with other aspiring accountants because that's what he told me he was doing. Yeah. And now Tim is dead and my husband has been lying to me for four months. Four months about where he spends his nights. I... I don't... I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. I... I was... I was trying to tell you this morning and then you... you rushed out. To work, Alden! I had to get to work. That's not fair. You're right. You're right. I thought we agreed. I thought we agreed that accounting was stable and consistent which is what we need for you after your whole crypto currency debacle. You promised that you would play it safe. Okay. All of the blogs said that crypto mining was a solid investment. But we are still paying it off, Alden. You promised! You promised! I know. That you would find something reliable. I know. And... and I tried accounting. I just couldn't do it. And then across the hall they had this Intro to Private Investigation. So I went over and, I don't know, something clicked. Accounting is just not my thing. It's just not your thing? Alden, this isn't a college job fair. Okay. I really don't wanna be the wife that nags you all the time. I don't. I love you but I just... you keep making promises and then you break them. Okay. Uh... Going good. There we go. Oh. Okay. No. No, no, no. No. No, no, no. No. No. Off. Off. Off. Oh boy. Okay. Come on, come on. Off. Off. Okay. Okay. - Hey. Hey. - I got it, I got it, I got it. No, no, no. I know, I know. I know, I got it. You're gonna burn yourself. You're gonna burn yourself. I had it. Sorry. I know how well you knew Tim. I'm not sure I know anyone well these days. Any, uh... any more updates? Apparently suicide. Hmm. So tragic. It really is. It's just... well, I mean, it doesn't explain why Kyle ran away before the cops came. You know? Innocent people don't run. How are you doing? Still processing. I know this is tough but we need to think about the big picture here. We need to assure our clients, our future clients and our employees that everything is under control. Yeah, that makes sense. But we're not expected to do anything today, right? Well, people will be looking for us to guide them through this. Tim wasn't just a partner, he was a real leader, and now someone's gotta fill that void. I need it to be you. Okay. I can do that. Good. Now... as your mother asking... how are you and Alden? I don't know, Mom. I mean, the jealousy with Kyle was one thing. But this lying about taking a PI class has just taken things to a whole other level. It's... I don't even know who my own husband is anymore. I thought you'd be relieved. Usually when a husband lies about where he is it's because he's with another woman or man. For better or worse, your husband lied about night school. So what, he's just gonna become a private investigator now? Let me ask you this, has he seemed happier lately? I don't know. Have you asked? A couple of us were thinking about going out for drinks tonight in honor of Tim. Would it be okay if I sent out a companywide email? Of course. Thanks Paula. Anything more from the police? Suicide, open and shut. Why? I mean, did Tim seem depressed to you? Nuh uh. Was he having money problems? Oh no. Tim was very wealthy. His position here was more for status than for a paycheck. It just doesn't make any sense. Well I've learned that people often only show us what they want us to see. I know this is tough. Chin up. Everyone's watching. Our win seems like a million years ago, doesn't it? Yeah. This is really hitting home, huh? Yeah. I mean, it's just... it's such a shock. You know, I came in today thinking it was just another work day and then... Paula, she told me what happened and I just... I can't believe it. Paula told you? Yeah, this morning. Why? No, you're right. That is unbelievable. Well... hang in there. I'm gonna miss you too but you've got a new family now. Hey. Are you sure you saw Kyle running out of the building last night? Positive. It's in my log book. You have a log book? Yes, I have a log book. At 7:43 PM Kyle left the Ironman Gym on Roosevelt Ave. In a different suit than he entered with. At 7:56 PM he arrived at the office parking lot. He walked into the building at 7:58 and minutes later he ran to the car and drove away. I just talked to Kyle and something isn't making sense. He said that he found out about Tim this morning. That's impossible. He was running away from the building like he'd committed a crime last night. There is something off about Tim's death. I feel it and I know you do too. Slow down there, Columbo. Let's not jump to conclusions. Or maybe... or maybe I need to follow him again tonight. Except he's going to this company drinks tonight we're having for Tim. Great! I'll come to that. And then... and then maybe before, you know, you and I could, uh, get pizza. No! No pizza. I'm still mad at you. Of course. We can do Chinese. Deal. Done. Hey. Uh... I need a small quick favor. I've never done this for a student before and I'm only doing so now because I believe in your potential. Understood? Understood. It's no suicide note. None found. By the way, this wasn't free. You owe me 7.50. I mean, like... like a bribe? No. Copies. - Here's the receipt. - Right. Who takes a $7 bribe? Suicide awareness for charity in honor of Tim. That is just so thoughtful. How are you holding up? I'm hanging in there. Tim looked out for everyone. But who was looking out for him? Thank you. I told you I should've brought my cowboy hat. Alden. Birdie's hus... husband. Yeah. We met at the, uh, holiday gala last year. I'm sorry about Tim. Oh, you... you two were close. Oh. You were very close. I loved him. Oh. It must be hard. Keeping all that a secret. We were going on a cruise next month. You know, he told his wife about me. His wife knew that you guys were in a relationship? Yeah, that's what Tim said. Hey, can I ask you something? What's the deal with your license plate? KRSHNIT? Yeah. Um... Tim encouraged me to get that actually. Uh... it just, it reminds me every day to go after what I want, you know? I can get on board with that. I am so glad that you two are getting along. But I think it's time to hit the trail. Alright. Catch you at the next rodeo? Partner. Yeah. One day at a time, buddy. Kyle and Tim together? I know. I did not see that one coming. And Penelope knew about it? If Tim was gonna leave his wife for Kyle, he would take all of his money with him. I call that motive. Or... the plot of a Murder She Wrote episode. Where's your evidence? Oh, I'll find some. Mmhmm. Okay. How about this? We go to Tim's funeral, we strike up a friendly conversation with the widow, and then when she's distracted... Alden, go to sleep. I'm tired. Babe! You know I do my best brainstorming in bed. Okay. How about this? Tomorrow we drop off some of Tim's things from his office and size up the wife. The widow. She sounds way more guilty when you say it like that. Fine. The widow. Marrying you was the best thing I've ever done. I thought Tim was loaded. Well this isn't his place, this is Paula's. Can you believe Eleonore had Paula clean out Tim's office? Good morning. - Hi. - Come on in. - Thanks so much. - Yeah. I've just got Tim's stuff over here so give me a second and make yourselves at home. Okay. Wow. I didn't know she was so into horses. Oh, you noticed that too? You know, it's kind of charming when it's in a bar but when it's in your house it's a cry for help. Says the guy who has no less than 20 robots in his garage. Help. Here we go. Oh. Thanks so much, Paula. Thank you. Is this, um, is that you? Yeah. That... that's me and my sister, Caroline. Now she's my angel in heaven shining down on me. I'm so sorry. So sorry. Well... thank you so much for keeping these safe, Paula. Anything for Tim. And if there's something else that you need, please just ask me. We will. Take care. Thanks again, Paula. Bye. Okay. Now we're talking. Hello Governor. That's a house. On behalf of the firm, I wanted to offer our services in case you wanted any help at all with Tim's estate. Oh, Timmy had many things. An estate was not one of them. So all this... Oh dear, all of this is in my name. From my father's side of the family. Not even... life insurance? He had a meager $100,000 policy that didn't pay out to suicides. Did you see any signs at all that Tim might've been depressed? Hardly. He was excited about going on that cruise next month with that boy from the office. So you did know about that? That Tim was gay? Yes, I knew. We didn't keep secrets from each other. It might've been unconventional but in marriage you're either growing together or you're growing apart. But you didn't come here for marriage advice. So why don't you ask me what you're really thinking? Do you really think Tim could've killed himself? I'm convinced he didn't. And what... what makes you so sure? Tim struggled for years with who he was. He finally was comfortable in his own skin. Was he having trouble with anybody or...? There's one thing that comes to mind. There was an incident at the apartments he was representing for the new owners. The Cecil Bay Apartments? That sounds right. He said it was sadly something to do with redevelopment or some such and that when they handed out the eviction notices he was threatened by one of the tenants there. He didn't go into much detail but something gave him quite a fright. Hmm. I take it by this line of questioning you're investigating this. - Yes. - No. Well, not in any official capacity. Well, not... not in any official capacity. If you have any other comments or anything else occurs to you, please feel free to contact us. And again, if the firm... if the firm can help you in any way, please don't hesitate to ask us. Sure. I think your husband is doing quite enough. Yes, he has. Marcia will see you out. Thank you so much for your hospitality. One more thing... Alden, we have to go. Let's be honest. You see everything that goes on around here. You notice anything strange about Tim's behavior lately? Bill Coulter from the yacht club. I know they were involved in some sort of lawsuit with each other but last week Bill and Tim had an argument in the driveway. What happened? Did he get violent? Physical? Bill didn't get out of the car. But there was a lot of yelling. What was the lawsuit about? I don't know. But they were both very angry. That's my business card. Feel free to contact me, day or night, preferably day. Good day. Business cards, really? I printed up a few. I'm trying out a couple different fonts. Ugh. I gotta get back to work, I'll drop you off at home. Okay? I thought we were going to the yacht club. Well as much as I do love their Cobb salad, I just can't. I don't have time. Since when have you been to the yacht club? Lots of times. They're our clients. Well let's go then. I can't. Eleonore's breathing down my neck. Actually... that's perfect. Then you can get the files on that case that Penelope was talking about. The Cecil... - The Cecil Bay Apartments. - The Cecil Bay Apartments, yeah. The Cecil Bay Apartments have new owners and they wanna turn them into high-end condos. Tim was dealing with the current tenants, trying to get them out nicely. Well, that sounds like a recipe for bad blood. We definitely need to get those files. No. No, no, no. No one's going over any files. That's privileged information. Ah. Got it. Playing by the book. No, I'm not playing anything any way. No, I gotcha. Alden, there's no... nothing to follow. Okay? No. You know what, I have to get to work, okay? And I would love to do this all day but I actually have a job that I have to get to the office for. It's fine. I can go by myself. Mister... Coulter. You can take the salad but leave the drink. Actually... I was hoping you and I could have a friendly little chat. Depends. Are you working for my ex-wife? No. Then sure. Interesting book. Knots For Sailors. It's driving me crazy. I wanna talk to you about... Tim Grant. I thought you said this was gonna be a friendly chat. Oh. So I see you've heard the news? I heard he checked out early. That's one theory. But you have another. Rumor has it you and he had a pretty heated argument. Oh yeah, I wanted to murder him. Did you? Son, if I killed every person that sued me, I'd be a serial killer. What was the lawsuit about? Yacht stuff. Rich old guy drama. I'm honored that you think I'm capable of murdering Tim but I just don't see that happening. Oh yeah? Why is that? Hip replacement a month ago, lost a fight with a sidewalk. I don't think I'd stand much of a chance with Tim. Oh! That's why you waited in the car. You're a very bright young man. Thanks for lunch. What? Five missed calls this morning, Birdie. I'm sorry. That's five times I needed you and you weren't there. Alden and I took a few of Tim's things out to his wife. Oh. That's very sweet of you but that is not your job. You're right. You're right. But I'm here now. Okay? My head's in the game. There are a dozen people clawing their way to the top here and right now you aren't one of them. The door's open, Birdie, but I can only hold it open for you so long. I'm doing the best that I can. Well, it pains me to say this, but it needs to be better. Hey girl. Figured you could use a midday pick me up. Oh, wow. I can't remember the last time someone brought me a coffee. Oh, it's nothing. Uh... hey. While I have you, a quick favor to ask you. Have you seen the files on the Cecil Bay Apartments? Oh, are you taking over that case from Tim? I'm just trying to fill in some of the gaps that Tim left behind. That's great. Uh... Yeah. Here you go. That should be everything you need. Great. Thank you so much. Oh... and hey, one more thing. When Tim gave notice to the tenants, did he mention seeing anything strange or...? Strange? Oh, you mean like that old lady with the gun in her nightgown? I would classify that as strange. I'm sure it was. No. But she did really spook him. Huh. Thanks. Natbot 8,000. Can you solve Tim's murder? Don't look at me like that. That's what you're here for. - Hey. - Hey. How's the office? Definitely not as fun as what we were doing before. Any luck at the yacht club? Nope. Swing and a miss. Hmm. Well, I thought these might help. The Cecil Bay Apartment files? Mmhmm. What changed your mind? You know, I just thought playing it by the book... overrated. Okay. Let's get all the tenants up on the board, shake the tree, see what comes out. There are 15 tenants in the Cecil Bay building. So Tim, acting on behalf of the new owners, was in the process of evicting the tenants so they could turn the building into luxury condos. Right. On that fact alone, everybody had a motive to want Tim gone. And our working theory is that same person went to Tim's office three days later, killed him, making it look like a suicide. Exactly. We've been able to definitively rule out 12 out of 15 tenants for various reasons. Either lack of means or opportunity or both. Which leaves us three potential suspects. Right. Number one. Francis Taylor. Apartment 201. Now this guy was convicted of manslaughter in 1982, he served 12 years, he's been living in the building ever since. He's been employed as a counsellor for newly released inmates, helping them get adjusted to their new lives. It's possible he did it. I don't see it. I don't either. And then we have the old lady with a gun in her nightgown. Eugenia Carmopolis, apartment 112. She does have a concealed carry permit so she has the means. Only problem is she's legally blind. Which leaves us... Frederick Gasko. Apartment 101. Now Mr. Gasko is the only tenant in the building who pays his rent in cash and the only picture on file is from a driver's license from 1989. Which I think we both agree is totally fake. For sure. I can't believe they spelled Massachusetts wrong. I mean, how do you get away with that? No, I think that's actually the real crime here. But the question is... why does Mr. Gasko need a fake ID? Perhaps it's because Frederick Gasko and Lean McGuiness are the same person. It does look like him. Because it is him. One of America's most dangerous mobsters, on the run, 30 years, hiding in plain sight. Lean McGuiness killed Tim because he was about to blow his cover and kick him out of his hiding spot. Mic drop. That's the game. Happy birthday! Hold up. I'm bumping on one thing. What? Lean McGuiness' body was discovered before Tim died. How does a dead man kill Tim? Okay, that's actually a really good point. I'm not sure but there has to be a connection. Come on! There's no way it's a coincidence that Tim very likely discovered Lean and then both Tim and Lean were found dead within the same week. It does seem unlikely. Come on. Just acknowledge we're onto something here. Alden Case, you are becoming quite the investigator. You're up early. Did you get any sleep? Actually, I woke up in the middle of the night with an idea. I know... what we need to do. - Veggie omelets? - Mmhmm. - Kiwis. - Yes. - Strawberries and pancakes? - Correct. What are you buttering me up for? Hear me out. I think we need to visit the Cecil Bay Apartments and see if Frederick Gasko is there. Whoa! That's a big step, don't you think? You saw the pictures. Frederick Gasko is Lean McGuiness. It's the same person. Yes, they do look alike. Okay. But I think the safest thing to do would be to call the FBI and tell them what we think. Argh! They are still investigating what happened to Lean McGuiness. We don't wanna get in the middle of that. Okay. Before we do that, how about this? We go to the apartments, we knock on the door, if Frederick Gasko answers, that's it I quit, game over. And if he doesn't answer? If Gasko's not there, we call the FBI, we tell them what we know. And you will stand down? I will hand the information over to the fancy people with their badges. Promise. Let me think about it. I have this meeting at 10:00 AM that I am not looking forward to. Oh yeah, I bet. I bet you do. Meetings are tough. You just think about it. Okay? Mmhmm. Just think about it. That's... that's excellent. You got a lot of knots back here, what's going on? I know. Oh God. Yes, I know. 100 percent, Mr. Keller. I mean, we're very excited, you know. We can't wait for the next steps. Thanks Ben, chat soon. Wait, was that the Keller call? I thought it was at 10:00. It got moved to 9:00. I thought you knew that. Kyle, great work. Start putting together your proposal. I'm on it. Doesn't feel good, does it? You did this on purpose. Kyle isn't half the lawyer you are. But he's hungry. Hey. Let's do this. Pick me up at 6:00 This is it. I can't decide if I want Gasko to be home or not. Okay. So we are just knocking on the door, Alden. And if he doesn't answer... I will stand down. Okay, let's do this. One sec. Fake mustache. Why would you need a fake mustache? So no one knows who we are. No one knows who we are anyway! Exactly. Alden. Hmm? Wait, wait, wait. What's with the hat? Come on, rookie. Oy vey. I can't believe we're doing this. In and out, okay? We're just knocking on the door. Just follow my lead. This is what I've been training for. Okay. 102, Ms. Berman. She's a kindergarten teacher. Hello? Yeah. This is, uh, Mario's pizza. What accent is that? We got a couple of pies here, they're for 103, that we can't deliver. Well that's not my problem. Okay. New plan. Yeah. We wait until someone comes out. Or we just use the keys. Where did you get those? They were in the file. Come on. Rookie. Oh. Charming little spot. Was it you? I'm sorry? Huh? Was it you who took my wheelchair? 'Cause I left it right here and the next thing I know it's gone. We... no, no, no. We haven't seen it. Are you alright? Do you need us to take you... I'll be fine. Well that checks out. I think she likes you. It's the mustache. Oh... are you jealous? Maybe. Yikes. Okay. This is it. 101. This is it, this is it. Uh... I'm having second thoughts. I'm just gonna knock. It literally says don't knock. It also says leave packages. I don't plan to do that either. Uh... Mr. Gasko? Mr. Gasko? Mr. Gasko? Alden! - Mr. Gasko? - Alden, let's go. Birdie, you need to get in here. Uh. This guy needs a housekeeper. We should really get outta here. Yeah, we should. Oh, my gosh. What is it? Look at all this mustard! This guy must be a real sandwich nut. Alden, let's go! Come on. Will you relax? It's not like we're... What? Birdie. Check this out. Alden! Right. Yeah. Now might be a good time to call the FBI. Let's call them from the car. I knew we shouldn't have come here. This was a mistake. Ella, call FBI. FBI! Put your hands up. Calling Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI. What's the emergency? I could get disbarred for this, Alden. I told you we should've gotten out of there. Birdie, we are this close to blowing this whole thing wide open. What planet are you living on? In the real world, if the FBI has you handcuffed in the back of a car, that means you have to make some serious life changes. Okay. Here's what I think we do. No. You know what? I can't partake in your detective fantasy anymore. Okay? I'm done. I'm done. Yeah, I'm on it. Unbelievable. Here he comes. Alright. Come on now. You're lucky my mom is who she is. Yeah. Thank you. Your story checks out. Of course it does. But listen up. Amateur hour is over. You understand? You're free to go. I am not an amateur. I've almost got my certificate... Uh... thank you so much Special Agent Digbee. So sorry for the trouble. Okay. Well what about the Tim Lean connection? 'Cause I'm starting to think that there is a real mob element at play here. In fact my new theory... Mr. Case, some free advice. Stay in your lane. Perhaps Reddit would be a more appropriate arena for you. Plus... I got an unmarked blue sedan that's been trailing me around, which means we are definitely close to something. - Wait. You're being trailed? - Yes. - By a blue sedan? - Yes. - You're sure? - Yes! - Well this changes everything. - It does? Absolutely... Not. Oh. Counselor. Alright, I'm going to talk to them. No, no, Alden. You promised. You promised that you would let the people with the badges solve this. I am not quitting. Oh, there it is. That look of disappointment. Please. Please. It is time to walk away. From what, Birdie? From the case or... or from our marriage? Maybe... maybe we should just quit and get divorced. Huh Birdie? You saw the papers. I drew those up after the cryptocurrency thing. I was angry. Okay? You weren't supposed to see. How did you get those anyway? They looked pretty official to me. I might've lied about accounting but you kept a divorce secret from me. I don't know whether to be hurt or impressed. Well, if you saw them why didn't you say anything? Because maybe... maybe saying it out loud made it true. So... so what is it? Are we... are we... are we done? It's like Penelope said, we're either growing together or we're growing apart. And for a while now... we've been growing apart. When we got married, is this what you pictured our life being like? No. Not exactly. I thought we'd, you know, have a boat and... and a kid or two. But as long as I'm with you, none of that matters. What did you think it was gonna be like? Not this. I'm not quitting on us. What are you doing? I'm walking home. Here's the keys. It's the other way, Alden. Thank you. Good evening. I'm Trisha Murata reporting live from the Cecil Bay Apartments on Third Street. More pieces of the puzzle are emerging as investigators confirm the location where notorious mob boss... Bird! Bird. Hey, hey. So what happened last night? Is it true? Did you get busted by the FBI? No. Well... not exactly. How did you hear? - Paula. - Paula. Yeah. Yeah The Cecil Bay developers called first thing this morning. How bad is it? Oh. No, no, no. They're ecstatic. They are? It's now the hottest property in town. Nothing gets rich yuppies putting down deposits more than a condo building that was once a mob hideout. That's great. Well, great. I'm glad to hear you say that. So no hard feelings? What do you mean? Well, I assume Eleonore told you. I'm the lead on Cecil Bay. Oh! Yeah, no... she told me. I am so happy for you. - Dream team, yeah? - Mmhmm. Yeah. Okay. Kyle was having an affair with Tim. Which Tim's wife was oddly cool about it. Simultaneously, Tim was trying to evict Lean McGuiness from his hiding spot of 30 years. Which might've caused Lean to call his old mob connections to get rid of Tim. We also know Lean had a neighbor, one Mrs. Eugenia T. Carmopolis, who was in possession of a gun. Now... could this have been a neighbor dispute? Did Lean like to watch his TV too loud? We just don't know. So apparently the Cecil Bay Apartments completely sold out. Everyone wants to live where Lean McGuiness was hiding out. Hmm. Babe. That's a big deal. We connected the dots to Lean McGuiness' hiding spot. A week after the FBI did. Well, they got resources. No, no, no. Let me go first. Let me go first. What was it? What? Wait, Alden. Be careful, be careful. It's just a brick. Perfect. A baseball glove? I don't know. Will you just... be careful. Okay? Don't cut yourself. What's it say? Let sleeping dogs lie. Okay. So... because you are "hot on the trail" with something involving "Lean McGuiness", you think that the brick that went through your window was somehow "mob related". That's correct, officer air quotes. It's officer Newton. It's not officer air quotes. Sorry, officer "Newton". You know what? Officer... are we in danger? You know what? It's probably just some kids playing a prank. I'll write a report, let you know if anything comes up. Thank you. Should I be concerned about that? Oh, that's just an "art project". Don't do things that I do. Have a nice night. Not you. Well, why throw a brick through the window? Why not just leave a note in the mailbox or tape it to the front door. It's to send a message, Alden. Leaving a letter in the mailbox, not exactly threatening. Mmhmm. Well it'd be the decent thing to do. You know what I think the decent thing to do is? I think the decent thing to do is just to take a step back and let things cool down a bit. I can't do that. Alden... whoever threw that brick knows where we live. What if next time they don't stay outside? Waiter. Watchmaker's apprentice. Cheesemonger. Notary. T-shirt screen printer. Museum docent. Barista. Crypto currency miner. What are you getting at? These are all the careers that I have started and quit. And some of them were too easy, some of them were too hard, some of them were just terrible ideas. Yeah, but all those things make you you. I don't wanna be known as the guy who quits things anymore. This case, I have to solve it. And that brick... that means we're making somebody very nervous. Yeah. And I'm a little scared. Me too. And I don't know exactly how this whole thing's gonna play out. Kinda like me and you. But I'm not quitting. Because I know in my heart they're both worth fighting for. Wow. It was Kyle all along. Ado Construction is the company that was developing the site where Lean McGuiness was found. It's on Kyle's shirt in this picture because the owner of the company is Kyle's uncle! How much coffee have you had? Birdie, this is the connection that we've been looking for. I think Kyle killed Lean McGuiness and then Tim. What? No. I... I really don't see Kyle being capable of one murder, let alone two. Do you have any proof? Not yet. I'm working late. I have to get my steps in. I think it's called running. No. It's called getting your steps in when the office has a competition of who can get the most steps in. And Kyle is killing it. See what I did there? That was pretty good. Look... do your thing but just please be careful. Okay. I'm Kyle, I get all my steps in. Kyle gets all his steps in. Hey Paula. Hey Alden. Birdie's in her office if you're looking for her. Uh, actually, I'm looking for you. Oh. You know how when Tim died you said to let you know if there was anything you could do to help? Well, I need your help. Um... you know how everybody's been tracking their steps for that infernal wellness challenge? I have almost hit my goal this week. Good for you! Do you have, uh, login info for the company tracking profile? I do. And you could pull all the GPS data for the last... two weeks? I've got some work to do now but I could do it later. Should I just give it to Birdie? Oh. No, no, no. Birdie's slammed. She's probably gonna be here all night. Um... I could come back in a couple of hours. You know what? I have errands to do in your neighborhood. Why don't I just pop it by tonight? That sounds perfect. - Great. - I'll see you then. - Okay. - Okay. Okay. I need coffee. Coffee. Yes, coffee. Mom? Kyle! You scared me. I see you're part of the night crew. I'm ordering Thai. You want in? Sure. Is anyone else still here? No. Just you and me. Hey Paula, come on in. Hi. Of course. Something funny? Ah... no. I mean, yes. But no. I just realized something. Anyway, thanks for coming. Did you bring the step data? I sure did. Why do you want it? I think I might've figured out a way to prove there was foul play in Tim's death. Oh! Good. Uh... here. Would you like something to drink? Got any bourbon? Coming right up. I'm sorry to do this to you, Bird. They forgot your chicken satay. Oh. That is totally fine. I will survive. You sure? Yup. Yup. Okay, if you say so. Phew. How many steps you get in today? Uh... 5,000, and that's with a morning run. How about you? Uh... let's see. 22,477. How is that possible? I'll show you. Okay? Check this out. Okay. So you can manually enter your steps on their back end. Wait. Are you serious? Yeah. Yeah. I read their terms of service, it's actually kind of scary. They store the GPS history of every user. Like, you wanna see where everyone is right now? That's a complete invasion of privacy. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. But I guess since you're already logged in... we can sneak a peek. Right? Yeah. The trick is, the step counter tracks data using GPS. Which means I should be able to prove unequivocally that Tim was actually murdered. Wow. Alden! You are quite the sleuth. Well... Have you told anyone else about this? No. No, you're the first. Mmm. That's good. I really wish you had let sleeping dogs lie. Hey, that's what the brick said. Paula? Paula? This is very impressive. I just wish someone had spent this much time trying to find justice for my sister, Caroline. Justice? Why, what happened? What happened? You are a funny little monkey, aren't you, Alden? Look, Paula. Whatever happened to your sister Caroline, I would've helped, I swear. No you wouldn't have! You would've been too scared of Lean McGuiness and his thugs. You would've kept your mouth shut just like everyone else. Everyone knew who killed her but they didn't do anything about it. She deserves justice. Huh? You've been on my tail this whole time. I have? Oh... I have. Because Kyle didn't kill Lean McGuiness. You did. And the GPS would've proven that. So, look at this. Okay? So that's you and me. Okay. Uh... that's your mom. And... Paula is... At my house. That's weird. Yeah. Wait. You said they store people's GPS history, right? Mmhmm. So can you see where everyone was the night Tim died? Yeah. Yeah, I can. Wow. I... I can't believe I never thought of this before. Let's see here. That's me finding Tim. Wait a second. Paula was there too. And she's leaving through the back door. Does that mean... Paula killed Tim? Yeah. I think it does. Alden. Oh my gosh! Alden! That's my mom, don't answer. She is a talker. Oh. Let's let that go to voicemail. This is Alden. I can't come to the phone right now. Leave a message. Alden! Alden! It was Paula all along. Call me. Now... What to do with you? Look, what do you say you cut me loose, we mosey on down to the Side Saddle, we go halfsies on a basket of jalapeño poppers and we just put this whole thing behind us. Huh? I'm afraid it's not that easy. It is! That monster killed my sweet sister 33 years ago. She was just walking home one day, took a shortcut down an alley and saw something she shouldn't have. And she was gone. They found her body two weeks later. Two weeks later! I'm really sorry about your sister but you don't have to hurt me. I didn't do anything. But you did! You got in the way! I did everyone a favor by killing Lean. And now... I have to do something with you. No you don't. No you don't! Does Birdie have any bleach? Bleach? What's this? No, no, no. Really? Now you're fixing the street? This is not happening, this is not happening. Okay. Just... Hey! Hang in there, baby. Birdie's coming. Now that I think about it, we don't have any bleach. We only use Earth friendly non-toxic cleaning products in this house. We're on sort of a... a new green... Never mind. I found drain cleaner, floor polish and some laundry pods. Uh... you know me, Mr. Curious. Why did you have to kill Tim too? I went to the office to scare Tim but he was gonna turn me in. So Tim had to be put out to pasture because he figured things out and wouldn't let it just be. You all assumed that Tim went to the apartments by himself. Ha! I'm always with Tim. But nobody ever sees Paula. I was with Tim, like I always was, when he went door to door at the Cecil Bay Apartments. And when we went to apartment 101 and Mr. Frederick Gasko came to the door, I knew instantly who he was. This old block of wood doesn't forget a face. So I went back. To Mr. Gasko with my trusty zapper and I gave him a send-off that he deserved. I would've said shock of his life, but... no time for humor. What are you gonna do with that? What are you doing? No, no, no. No, no. No. No. Take a sip. You'll go right to sleep. Nuh uh. Oh, that smells terrible. You know, we could do this the easy way or the hard way. Look at me. Look around you. I'm a 38-year-old private investigator in training. I don't do anything the easy way. Have it your way. What does that mean? Paula, what does that mean?! Uh... So... so... so, you drove to Rhode Island with Lean's body in your car and you dumped it at the construction site to make it look like a mob hit. But why was Kyle wearing the T-shirt? Kyle's uncle owns Ado Construction. Yeah. You'd be hard-pressed to find a construction site in Rhode Island that wasn't done by them. It was a happy accident. Oh... Uh huh. And, uh... how did Tim figure it out? Tim knew my sister was killed by Lean McGuiness and when they found his body he put two and two together. We were the only people who knew Lean's hiding place. Help me out here. Any ideas? What? Man, you're good. Tim was gonna go to the FBI about me, and they would've found me, so he had to be silenced. No. Yes! Help me! Help! Help! No one is coming to save you, Alden. No, no, no, no, no. Help! No, no, no. Paula. Paula. P... P... P... What about Birdie? Think about... think about Birdie. Sweet little... sweet little Birdie. I know, poor Birdie. Right? Don't worry, I am gonna be there to help her through this. That's not really what I had in mind. And now... it's time for heaven to get another angel. Nuh uh. - Open up. - Mm. - Mm. - Open up! Open! - Open up. - Mm. - Open up! - Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm... - Open up, Alden! - Mm. Alden? In here! Freeze! Who are you? That's Rick. Drop the... turkey baster. Get her! Get her! Get her! Get her! Natbot! Get her, Rick! Got you. Get her! Let me go! Come on, get up. - Get her, Rick. - Get off of me! Show her who's boss. Get her! There you go. You got her. We did it! I knew it was you in the blue sedan the whole time. Alden! Are you okay? Birdie! Natbot. - Alden? - Birdie! Alden? Alden? Hi honey. Tonight, a bizarre ending to the mystery surrounding the fate of Lean McGuiness. We're hearing that Paula Saint Gervais, who's sister, Caroline Saint Gervais, was killed by Lean McGuiness in 1987... Well, I told them all about the GPS. That should seal things up. Thanks, man. Hey, I'm really glad it was me you chose to follow. Well, yeah. You did good, glasses. Looks like you finally got your feet wet. Thanks Detective. - Don't. - Yeah, it's... Yeah. Yeah. Did you just make a new friend? I don't know if I'd go that far. Before they take her away, there's something that's been bothering me. Wait. What do you mean? Officer! Wait, one sec. I need to Columbo her. Hey Paula, how did you get Lean's body into the car that night? I didn't have a plan for that. When I got to the apartment building there was a wheelchair sitting there. Of course! Mrs. Carmopolis' wheelchair. Yes! Well, I think we're done here. Take 'er away, boys. I've always wanted to do that. You were made for this. I'm so happy to see you. I know. Authorities aren't releasing any more details at this time. But my sources tell me the case was solved by a local husband and wife private investigation team. So... how does it feel? Ah, it's a little sore. No. How does it feel to solve the case? Oh... I... I can't believe we solved it. - We did it! - I know. Mmm. That hits the spot. - It's pretty good. - Mmhmm. So tell me... When we got married, is this what you imagined your life would be like? Oh, not at all. This? Way better. Hmm. 'Cause I get to do it with you. What's this? It was our divorce papers. - No more secrets. - No more secrets. I love you, baby bird. I love you, big bird. Babe. Come on. We can't be late for my mom. Well, the door's not gonna lock itself. I know, but you know how punctual she is. Okay? I just... I know. I mean, safety first. Are you the Case's? Who... who's asking? I'm Johnny D'Rossi. My family owns the wine and cheese store on Fifth. Mmhmm. Oh. You guys have great pickles. Thank you. This is for you. It's a ham. Oh. Bone in. I spent a lot of years with Lean McGuiness. Too many. But his murder had a lot of people worked up and what you did prevented more bloodshed. You ever need a favor, you come by the store. Your husband, he did a great service. Actually, uh... we're partners. Hmm? Oh... Well then, you're lucky you two have found each other. Yeah. We are. So... was that really Johnny "Palm Trees" D'Rossi? Yup. Of the D'Rossi crime family? Mmhmm. And the giver of fine hams. Oh, this ham's really heavy. Hi. Birdie. Alden. Mrs. Grant reached out and wanted to speak to you both. What are you holding? Mobster ham! Oh, Mrs. Grant. It's nice to see you again. I wanted to formally express my gratitude to you both. Tim has considered this firm to be part of his extended family and I am so grateful for your diligent work to find the truth. Well, it's the least we could do for Tim. Because Tim's death has been reclassified as a homicide, his life insurance policy is no longer void. And I think that Timmy would want you... to have this. A million dollars? It's a $100,000. $100,000?! This is... I... I don't even... Thank you. Maybe that will help you get your investigation business off the ground. That is so generous. Thank you very much. And I'll be in charge of the accounting. Absolutely. Detective. Good work you two. You know, Penelope was right. You keep this going, I might have a few clients to send your way myself. Eleonore? Is that actual approval I'm hearing? Something like that. Hmm. So I'll see you tonight? Tonight. Mmm. Can't wait. Birdie. One second. Penelope was very impressed with what you and Alden did. You two seem... better. We are. Hey, Mom. I mean... Eleonore. I'm sorry that I was so distracted around here. No. I'm the one that should be apologizing. I can admit that I pushed you too hard, and what I don't wanna do is push you away. I think this is where we hug. Not in the office, dear. Missing persons investigations. Who... I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh, hi. Come on in. Thanks. Mrs. Case, glad you could make it. Hi. - Okay... - Thank you. Missing persons investigations. Who knows where to start with something like this? I mean, everyone is saying that Rick is the hero, but when you think about it, he was just sitting in his car the whole time. Well, I mean, he did kinda... you know... save your life. Well... Are you expecting somebody? No. Hello? Mr. And Mrs. Case. I got your name from Penelope Grant. I need your help. - Of course. Come on in. - Thanks. So... how can we help? I don't even know where to start.
