THEY WANT TO COME WITH US. NO. I BETTER TALK TO THEM. YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME WHEN YOU NEARLY FILLED ME FULL OF BUCKSHOT? YOU WERE RIDING HOME IN A WAGON FULL OF TURNIPS AND I HELD YOU UP FOR THE WELLS FARGO PAYMENT. YOU WERE ALWAYS MAD WHEN I GOT THE DROP ON YOU. I SAW YOU HALF A MILE BACK THAT DAY. YOU BEEN SAYING THAT SINCE YOU WERE 8 YEARS OLD BUT I CAUGHT YOU EVERY TIME. YOUR FATHER LOVED YOU VERY MUCH. YOU SHOULD NEVER FORGET THAT. I REMEMBER THE SUMMER WHEN MY FATHER WAS SCOUTING AGAINST THE NAVAJOS AND YOU ALL PUT ME UP? YOUR FATHER WOULD KISS YOU EVERY NIGHT. I REMEMBER IT WHEN HE TRIED TO KISS YOU GOODNIGHT. YOU WERE WHAT? MAYBE 9, 10? YOU WENT CRAZY. I GUESS YOU'LL BE MOVING ON NOW. I'M NOT LEAVING. I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL-- NO ONE'S MAKING ME MOVE. MY FATHER BUILT THIS PLACE. I'LL HIRE SOMEONE TO WORK IT IF I HAVE TO, BUT I'M NOT LEAVING. MARY AND INEZ ARE DEAD, AREN'T THEY? NO, I THINK THEY'RE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET 'EM BACK.

HERE WE GO. THE BOOK OF MORMON TEACHES THAT WAY BACK IN BIBLE TIMES, A LOST TRIBE OF ISRAEL SETTLED HERE. AFTER A WHILE, THEY SPLIT INTO TWO BUNCHES. THE NEPHITES, WHO WERE BELOVED OF GOD AND THE LAMANITES, WHO WERE EVIL. THEY HAD THIS WAR, AND THE LAMANITES KILLED OFF THE NEPHITES. GOD WAS SO ANGRY HE TURNED THEIR SKINS RED AND MADE THEM DARK SAVAGES. THAT'S WHY YOU'VE GOT YOUR INDIANS TODAY! HE IS A LAMANITE! YOU SEE THIS? IT'S AN OLD-TIME LAMANITE SKULL. NAVAJO. NO.

SCARED ME TO DEATH. STILL CAN'T FIGURE WHY HE WANTS TO LIVE IN PHILADELPHIA. DO YOU EVER NOTICE THE WAY HE LOOKS AT ME SOMETIMES? HIS MOTHER USED TO LOOK AT ME THAT WAY WHEN WE LIVED BACK EAST. SHE WASN'T ASHAMED OF ME, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE EDUCATION OF HER FRIENDS. I THINK SOMETIMES SHE FELT BAD FOR ME IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. I THINK THAT'S WHY SHE HAD ME BRING HER OUT HERE. THAT'S WHY I SENT TOM BACK EAST TO COLLEGE SO NO ONE WOULD EVER LOOK AT HIM THAT WAY. ( Noble ) THERE THEY ARE. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? THEY'D SEE US COMING. WE'LL TAKE 'EM TOMORROW AT LEE'S FERRY. WISH WE HAD A FIRE. NOT TONIGHT. THEY'RE TOO CLOSE. LOOK AT THAT SKY. YOU CAN SEE EVERY STAR GOD CREATED. ( Noble ) YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF 'EM.

YOU WERE BORN THERE. WHEN YOU WERE 2 YEARS OLD, I DECIDED TO LEAVE THE ARMY. LOADED YOU AND YOUR MOTHER IN A WAGON, WE SET OUT FOR FLAGSTAFF. WE'D STOP FOR THE NIGHT RIGHT DOWN IN THAT BASIN. YOUR MOTHER HAD JUST HANDED YOU DOWN TO ME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE THE HORSES JUMP. THE WAGON ROLLED, AND SHE FELL UNDER THE WHEEL. HER RIBS WERE ALL STOVED IN. WE WERE MILES AWAY FROM ANY HELP. I TRIED TO MOVE HER, BUT EVERY TIME SHE'D SCREAM. SHE STARTED SPITTING BLOOD. THE HURT COME IN WAVES AND YOU'D START CRYING. SHE'D SWALLOW THE PAIN AND HOLD YOU IN HER ARMS TILL YOU QUIETED DOWN. MUST HAVE BEEN ALMOST MORNING AND SHE STARTED TO GO. I TOLD HER, "YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT. "YOUR SON LOVES YOU TOO MUCH TO LET YOU DIE." SHE SMILED AT THAT. THEN, SHE WAS GONE. SHE'S BURIED RIGHT OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. ( Jack ) WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'? MARY, GO! WHAT HAPPENED, JACK? TAKE THE PRINCESS AWAY. SURE, JACK. SHE CUT ME. UNLOAD THE PACKHORSE.
