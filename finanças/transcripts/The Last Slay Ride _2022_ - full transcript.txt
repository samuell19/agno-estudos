You told me you would pay me back when you sold your film. That's what you said, remember? Yeah. You sold the fuckin' thing, so fuckin' pay me. 10,000 by next week, or I'll shoot your fuckin' dog. Wait, I don't have a dog. - Cats. - No. - Hamster. - No. - Goldfish. - No. - Your grandma, then. - No, no. Yeah. I'll shoot your fuckin' grandma. Wait, it was 5,000. Plus the interest, you little shit. "Fuck you. Pay me." Do you know that line? That movie? Good stuff. You got problems, I don't care. Fuck you. Pay me! 10,000? Ten fucking thousand, by next week. Okay, got it. And if you, if you try to ditch me. Pop, pop! No more grandma cookies. You get me? Yes, I got you. I got it. You're a good kid. Tell grandma I said hello. - What? - Nothing, nothing. Well, ho-ho-ho, motherfucker. You're not gonna wish me a merry Christmas? Merry Christmas? Good. Now get out my face and go get my money. Hey. Anything? Shit, what happened to you? Marco. He gave us a card. Ugh, it's gettin' worse, huh? Yeah, yeah. Anyway, did you call? Uh, I called. Sent an email, sent a notarized fuckin' letter. He's ghosting us. Not cool, man. Well, osh, call again. Ivan, I've called a thousand fucking times. Lust get the same voicemail over and over again. "This is Max rampage! Rampage media. Largest distributor of horror films in the entire fucking world." Blah-blah-blah-blah-blegh. I think we're screwed, man. Hey, we owe everyone money. Casting crew was on deferments. Even Lauren's mad at me. That's fucked. I'm sorry, bro. We, uh, where were we? - Money. - Right, money. Yeah, uh. Good news. If we don't start paying off our loans, they're gonna kick us out of the dorm this month. Merry Christmas. Josh, what are we gonna do now, bro? I don't know. But I gotta go to work. You won't have to deliver pizzas forever, bro. You know, I've made more money delivering pizzas than I ever did as a filmmaker? You're a great writer, osh. Youust need a break. Yeah, don't we all. My gosh. Ugh. So? Hold on. Well? Hold on. And? Looks like we're making a movie. Oh! Yeah! Where are we gonna get the money? School. I know a guy. - Yeah? - Yeah. What's his name? Marco something-or-another. He wants to fund our movie? He'll loan us the money, yeah. Gmm! I guess we're makin' a movie, man! Yeah! Oh, shit! Fuck! Hey, Ivan. What's up? Oh, we'reust makin' a movie. Oh, cool. Could we like audition? Yeah, of course. - Dude. - Huh? Oh, yeah. Uh, mmm-hmm. - Thanks! - See ya later. Yeah. Yeah, you too. Josh, let's go. This way. Let's go. Oh, hi! Yeah, you can come on in. You guys are makin' a movie? I mean, you are, right? I saw the signs everywhere. - Yeah. - Yeah, that's us. Can I help? Are you an actress? No. What about crew? No. Maybe. I don't know. Okay, you got any experience? I like horror movies. And I'll work for free. - You're in. - Awesome. Wait, you said you like horror movies. Yeah. I'must, I'm serious. I'm asking because we don't have any horror fans on our crew. I mean, Ivan here is a, uh, rom-com fan. He likes to cry himself to sleep at night. It's true. I'm a very lonely man. I still cry when I masturbate. - I, uh. - Um. Ignore him, please. He's, he's an idiot. I'must asking, you know? Fan to fan. Okay, well. Lately I've been really into Italian retro horror. You know, like Freda, bavo, bulriva. Fulci, argento, of course. But I have to go back to, hmm. Let's say "no one gets out alive," the 73rd version. I saw it the first year with my dad at a horror revival when I was like six, I think? Yeah, we used to go all the time. Okay, yeah. I mean, I can dig it. It's a little obscure, but uh, yeah. It was pivotal to the American stalk and slash type of movies and kind of had that bird with the crystal plumage vibe, ust a tighter story. So, yeah. Yeah, I can agree with that. Cool, yeah. What's your name? Oh, essica. Well, I'mosh. I'm the writer/director. And this is Ivan, the uh, the crying masturbator, I guess. Hey. Oh, no. I'm good. Uh. For the record, I'm ambidextrous. I, eh. Anyway, aren't you a little young to be a film school student? Aren't you a little old? Ow. Josh dropped out of real college to go to film school. Yeah, and I got the student debt to prove it. - Mmm, that sucks. - Yeah, it does. So now what? Mmm, you wanna help with auditions? - Yeah, scoot over. - Cool. No-ho-ho! Ned, if you stay, he's gonna turn you into meat. All right, kids. Are you guys ready for the best hike of your lives? We got... This is gonna be the best hike of your life. We're gonna find all sorts of warm, cuddly animals, like bears and snakes, and maybe we'll even find a honey badger. Sorry, camp wannabe warriors. Looks like old bungalow bill has eaten all the hiking snacks. Uh, line? No. Not you! Don't give up! He'll, he'll kill you if you stay. He'll turn you into meat! Oh, ned! No, no, no, no, no! Be my food! Jarvis, this stew tastes funny, and not like a clown with a meat cleaver at midnight kind of funny. More like when you're drunk aunt tries to French you at your college graduation. No, no! No, no, no! We got snakes and bears, and uh, honey badgers. Um, maybe we'll look at some trees. Uh. I know! Let me do that one more time. Jarvis, this stew tastes funny. Not like a clown at midnight with a meat cleaver funny, but more like when your drunk aunt tries to French kiss you at your college graduation. It'sust not right, arvis. It's not right. Oh, no! No, no, no. My god, will! Where are the kids? Where are the kids! Alrighty, kids. This will be the best hike of your life. Do you hear? I'm telling you I know! Oh, ned! Is that right? All right, kids. We're gonna have the best times of our lives, and, and there's gonna be hiking, and, and we're gonna find all kinds of cuddly, uh. We're going to find all the kinds of cuddly and, try to find all kinds of, yeah, what? No. No. No. Ah, I know. Do you hear what a, wait. Um, okay, do you wanna keep rollin' or? No! You have to go for help. I'll stay here and fight him off. No, you can't. He'll kill you. It doesn't matter if I die, as long as you live, my love. Now go! Scene. So you do a lot of theater, do ya? Correct. That was really good. What? It was good. Okay. Thanks for comin' in today. Evan. You know, like even, but with an a. Right. With an a. Got it. Thanks. And I'm Ivan, with an I. So like Evan with an I. Evan, Ivan, dude! We're like brothers! Sure. So did I get the part? I think... uh, yeah, uh, um. We'll be in touch. Rude. What the heck was that for? Geez. Oh, well, you can't do that with everyone who walks through the door. He's not everyone. He's special, I'm telling you. Yeah, with the a part. What the hell is that part? - Yeah, yeah. - A? Ivan? Even with an? I don't know if wanna be stuck with that guy. Cool. Wow. I gotta follow that? Oh, hey! Hi, hi! Uh, you made it. Yes, I did. Uh, hi. My name's Lauren Moore, and today I'm gonna audition for the role of, uh, Alice black, the lead in the movie "slash camp," which great title, by the way. Did you come up with it? Yup. Yeah, that was me. It's hot. It's not. It's... You know what? Cool. Let's see you audition. Oh. Um. Can I ask you a question? Of course, ned. What is it? Well, don't be scared. You can ask me anything. Do you like me? Yes or no? Oh. Oh, ned! I can't answer this. But why? Because. I don't have a pencil. Cut. Do you need me to do it again? Is there? Anything, anything you want. No, no, that was, that was great. We're making a fucking movie. This is gonna be so fucking awesome. Hey, uh, can we get some more steam on these entrails here? All right, people. Let's get some smoke on these guts! Be my food! Cut! Hey, man. How's the movie comin'? Oh, all right. Good talk, good talk. All right, will. Where are the kids? Where are? Hi, Ivan. How's it goin'? You get the movie done yet? Come on. Hey, yo, Ivan. Is the movie ready yet? What the fuck, bro? Come on! We've been waitin' all damn day. Hurry up! Oh, wait. Hey. How's it goin'? Ivan. "Queen 3" is far superior to "blood bank 2." "Blood bank 2" is crap. They didn't even bring back electra count, the main vampire. She owned that film. Heck, she is that franchise. Ugh, and Carmen Carlisle freaking slayed in that role. Le-gend. Okay, all right. Look, I like the electra count character just as much as anyone else, totally. You gotta understand that they were trying to do something new with the franchise. They were trying to move the franchise in a different direction. Introduce some players and create a whole new cinematic universe. Yeah, all right. I can see that. But they still needed to keep electra in it. Even if it was a small part, they could've used her to connect the horror universe. And they corrected that in part three, which is why it's superior. Fine. All right, part three's slightly better. I know it is. Lauren. Jessica. Lauren. Josh. Uh, essica. - Osh. - Ess- - Can you guys not? What's up, bro? It's done. Whoa, are you serious? - No fucking way. - Oh my gosh! Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. You gotta be quiet. I want quiet in here. No talking and everybody can enjoy the video, ayit? Oh, no. And if you take a look around, kids, you might be lucky enough to find some poison Ivy. Or, oh, I know! Everybody's favorite itchy bad guy: Poison oak! Bungalow bill, are you eating all the hiking snacks? Sorry. Sorry, camp wannabe warriors. Looks like bungalow bill has eaten all of our hiking snacks. Kids? My god, bill! Where are the kids? No! Don't be scared. You can ask me anything. Do you like me? Check yes or no. Oh, ned! What? What is it? What's wrong? I can't answer this. What? Why not? Because I don't have a pencil. No! Run, bill! Be my foods! Oh! Bill! Ned, he'll kill you! It doesn't matter if I die, as long as you live, my love. Now go! Okay. Really? Oh! Oh! And the winner for the best actor is Bob! - Bob! - Yeah! - Oh, way to go, Bob! - Woo! Best actor ever! Aw, this is crazy. And our nominees are "corpse love". "Dangerous mice." "Slash camp." And "Gore whore 3: Gore whore on wheels." And the winner is "slash camp"! Oh! Bob! Bob! Where are you going? You're going to the after party, right? Uh, yeah. Bob's got a limo! Well, I can have a limo. Really, you do? No. Bye. Oh, is that the one where they kill animals for young, and the director was arrested because they really thought he killed people? No, you're thinking of "cannibal apocalypse." Not the same film at all. "Hannibal dancer" has a bit of a comedy flair to it and stars Mary thore. You know, follows a young cannibal dancer, moves to Italy to pursue dance, but she ends up being chased. Cool. I know you. Dammit, Holland. So we're being chased, and I say, "I doesn't matter if I die, as long as you live, my love. Now go." That's it. My movie's completely original, right? It's an '803 throwback slasher, but with a twist. Yeah, you actually don't do so good at parties, but it makes all the difference when we win, yeah. Check that out. I know, right? It's about a group of teens who go into the woods, but there's this giant, hulking killer in a mask. J“ rock star” j“ style your heart out“ j' blast off“ j“ get lost' style your heart out that sounds phenomenal. Please, tell me more. Yeah, okay. Anyways, you'd be great in it. I mean, there's no pay, but hey, the exposure would be great. I mean, uh. Do you, do you shoot nude? Max rampage. Rampage media. The largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Oh, yeah.

He has hundreds and hundreds of films on his website. What do you wanna bet he hasn't paid any of 'em. Yeah, it's fucked up, dude. Exactly. We can't let him get away with this.

Wait, I don't have a dog. - Cats. - No. - Hamster. - No. - Goldfish. - No. - Your grandma then. - No, no. Nothin'. No, bullshit. What, man? Okay, he's gonna shoot my grandma. Yeah.

If I don't pay him back by next week, pow! Pow! Pow! He's gonna shoot my grandma. No, I, I, I heard you, but what? I like my grandma, dude. Yeah. She doesn't deserve any of this shit. She makes cookies, remember? The little macaroons. Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I remember. They tasted like bingo halls smells. That doesn't mean she deserves to get shot, bro. Yeah, yeah, I know. I'm not saying that. I love your grandma. Most people's grandmas are great. I'must saying what kind of sick mind operates like that? Josh, that's why we gotta do something, all right? We'llust go down to his house, demand that he pays us, that's it. And if he doesn't, then we'll, we'll, we'll steal his fucking TV. Yeah, yeah. All right. Let's say we do that. Not, not the stealing the TV part, but the asking for our money part. Do you have a plan? Josh, osh, osh. All I've got are plans. Ugh. Hey. Hey. What's up? Wanna help us Rob a mansion? Not exactly how I was gonna start that conversation, but. Um, okay. How were you gonna start it then? Like this. All right. Sorry. So you're gonna Rob a mansion? - No. - Yes.

Everybody says so, but here I am back in the game store working for minimum wage, dealing with nerds whoust wanna stare at my tits all day. Yeah, I deserve to get paid. Oh, andosh, fuck you for not calling me! In my defense, I was really embarrassed. Oh? Louder. Look, I screwed up, okay? We trusted that distributor and he hasn't paid us a single fucking dime. You haven't gotten paid like at all? Nothing. Everyone thinks you'reust ducking them and keeping the money for yourselves. That's great, 'cause we're not. There's no money, I swear. It's true. We got hosed. Okay, okay, well, let's say that's true. What are you even gonna do about it then? Rob that fucker. We're not robbing anybody. We'reust going to go to his house. We're gonna demand that he gives us our money, politely. That's it. And you're telling me because? Come on, you know. You're my, my girlfriend. Or you were. I don't know. I'm sorry. We fucked up. We kind of fell in love with the dream. You know, I thought that we were gonna be like famous and living in Hollywood and now I'm sleeping alone on a futon, delivering pizzas, and it sucks. And I'm sorry, okay? And if I don't start paying back my student loans- - for what it's worth, I'm sorry, too. Look, you were great in the movie. Fantastic. But we're out of options. We got a plan.

You owe us money, our money. $20,000. Oh, I see. - Good. - No. What did you say to me? I said quite clearly, no. You don't get to come here making demands. That's not how this works. What are you doing? Looking for your dog. Odd. Gonna fuckin' shoot him. Odder still. We don't have a dog. You have to help us. He has a gun. I know. Must be very frightening, I'm sure. He seems quite unhinged. Perhaps you should put him in a movie. He's quite the character. Perhaps you should come in, please. What is his name? Marco something-or-another. - Marco. - Polo. You did not. We don't have a dog. Any pets? No, I'm afraid not. Have you got a grandma? Well, yes, grandma's here, but. I'm gonna fuckin' shoot her. You can't shoot her, I'm sorry. We're quite fond of her. Please, do come in. We'reust sitting down to dinner. Really, do come in. Let's get to the bottom of this, shall we? Come, let's settle this. Ho-ho-ho! Dude, don't do the thing. Max rampage. Rampage media. The largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Yes, you did. Yeah, yeah, we've met before. At the hotel. The video screen film festival? You gave us distribution. For yourfilm. Yeah. Excellent! We are the largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Right. I'm sorry, but, um, what the fuck is going on here? That's a very good question. You come to our home on Christmas Eve, nonetheless, just as we're preparing our evening meal, with hobo Santa. So you tell me, child. What exactly is going on here? Go on. We're all listening. Well, I didn't bring. I mean... What is going on, Victoria? Nothing, grandma. Everything's fine. Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho! It's grandma time! Goodbye, gran! Ah! Oh my god! Ah! Ah! Oh my god! Oh, geez! Oh! Ah! Ah! Ah! Oh, god. Oh, fuck! She bit him! What is this? He shot you, grandma. That little cocksucker shot me? Yes, he shot you. What do you suggest we do about it? Let's tie 'em up and rip their intestines out through their assholes and hang them like garlands around the house, and bathe in their blood, and dance naked to the sounds of their screams! Just like in the old days. That seems completely reasonable. Arvid, love, would you be so kind as to call the children? Yes, my queen. Dog whistle in the key of bauhaus. You said you didn't have a dog. We don't. What? Doesn't call dogs. It calls the gods, dear. Out from their shallow lairs and underground clubs, out of their basements and away from their video games, they come, marching to a gothic dance beat. Pleaseust shut up! You don't like goth music? Nobody really likes gothic music. Well, you're an offensive little toad, aren't you? First you barge in here uninvited, then you shoot grandma, and now you have the nerve to criticize my taste in music? Lust can't with you. Nina? Oof. Yum, yum, yum! What the fuck? Yum, yum, yum! Yum, yum! Are you kidding me right now? You're vampires? Like actual freaking vampires? Really? This is so cool! On my gosh! I have like a hundred questions! Um, first one. How do you guys... run! Goths. We've gotta get to the car. Back door! Let them run, get their blood pumping. But don't let them escape. Max. Max rampage. Rampage media. The largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Max dear, I want you to go with arvid. Chase them, scare them. I like my dinner served hot and messy. Adrenaline is the spice of life, after all. Do you understand? We are the largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Yes, I know. So go distribute some horror. Can you do that for me? - I can. - Okay. We're surrounded. Oh, shit! There's so many of 'em. We'll never make it! Josh? I never loved you. Lust wanted to be in your movie. And honestly, it wasn't even that good. The movie or the sex? Both. Oh, ouch. Arvid? I'd like you to lead the hunt. Chase them, torment them. You can take Max with you or lose him. I don't really care anymore. Just keep an eye on the time. I will rip the meat from their bones. Lovely. Torson, I'd like you to make sure they don't get past the children, okay? Nina, you're with me. Let's have some fun. And grandma? Oh, right, yeah. Grandma? What? What's going on? We're hunting now, grandma. Hunting who? The interlopers. Where are they? They're in the house. Do you want to hunt them? Yes! Now? You wanna do this now? Like right now? Like right now you wanna do this? Nope, that's it. Bye. Wait. You have to go get help. I'll fight 'em off. They'll kill you, Evan. This is not some stupid movie. Doesn't matter if I die, as long as you live, my love. Now go! Whatever. Huh? Are you serious right now? That was some of the worst acting I've ever seen! Hers or mine? - Yours. - Both. Okay, do you need a hand? I'm old, you scraggly, little cock monkey! I'm not. I'm not, what's that word? - Incompetent? - Irate. - Irregular. - Irascible. Incapable! That's the word. I'm not incapable. I'm gonna rip their assholes through their mouths. That sounds truly unpleasant. I like it. Can I borrow it? Borrow this! I think that is physically impossible. Grandma's very creative. Well, she has been at this for more than 5,000 years. If anyone can make it happen, she can. Okay, well, we can discuss the possibility of ripping someone's asshole through their mouth later. Off you go, grandma. Have fun. Fine. Fuck you, then. Wait for me! Evan! You can'tust leave me here! Oh! No! osh! osh! Stop. Close the door! Lock it! Where are the vampires? Why haven't they attacked yet? They're gone. Where? Keep watch. This isn't happening. I mean, this isn't happening. Oh, it's happening. And it's freaking awesome! What is wrong with you? Dude, so many things. You don't even know. Oh! Fuck! I should've stopped her, man! I should've fucking stopped her because I really loved her. I, mmm! - You good? - Yeah. We have to get out of here. We need a plan. Well, I had a plan, but Marco- - shut up! Bob. With us? Listen, we can't go outside because of the goths. We can't stay inside because of the vampires. So we have to fight. Can we? "Night of the blood freaks," 1984. Oh, yeah. "Blood freaks," '84. When family pets begin to go missing, a group of plucky teenagers suspect that their neighbors might be a vampire, and they set out to destroy him before he works his way up to human prey. It's got the vhs box cover art with the light up green eyes. Such a great film, man. I don't know if I'd call it great. You know, no "blood haunt," but. Oh, yeah. "Blood haunt." Three vampires in a carnival house with, uh, Marilyn carp? It was Marilyn blanks. You're thinking of "funhouse from hell." But that doesn't matter. What happens in "blood freaks"? Uh, they fight. And? They, uh, they win. - Say it again. - They win. That's right. They win. We have to do this. Okay. Now, who knows about vampires better than you? Besides obviously me. Uh, nobody. I've seen every vampire film, foreign and domestic. Exactly. You've been preparing for this moment your entire life! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, fuck Lauren, man! She's dead. Gross. But okay, fuck Lauren. Well, I mean, I didn't literally mean fuck Lauren. But I did. I did fuck Lauren. I know what you mean, osh. - Right. - Right. Uh, guys? Grandma's coming! Yum! Yum! Yum, yum, yum, yum! We need a plan now! Uh, uh! Oh, quick! Run upstairs! I'must, I'moking. I'm not that stupid. But we should probably split up. Yeah. Yummy, yummy, yum, yum. Oh, essica! Remember that you're a girl, so don't like trip or fall down or do something stupid like that, okay? - Got it. - Yeah. There. I'll go find the others and deal with grandma. You know what to do. Ho-ho-ho! Grandma? Grandma? Grandma? Gramps? Max rampage! Rampage media! The largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Max seems to be degenerating. Yes, well, he's never been the brightest screw in the drawer, but he does seem to be slipping a bit. Yes. It happens sometimes. Eternity breaks them. He didn't even make a decent Santa this year. Or the year before that. Or the year before that. Or the year before that. You're right. This has been going on too long. Perhaps it's time to replace him. Perhaps. I could have legal draw up a new company. Bankrupt rampage media. Find fresh blood. That's a good idea. Men are so unreliable. Truer words have never been spoken, my queen. Okay. Max goes. Arvid and torson, too. They bore me. A clean house is a pretty house. And, um, grandma? She's family. Understood. Bring me one of the girls, though. I have an idea. As you command, my queen. Hey. What are you doing? She's chasing me. All right. Don't you think you should get up? Duh, I knew that. Just tripped and started crawling. Mmmhmm. Sorry, got caught up in a cliche there for a minute. No, that's fine. It happens to the best of us. I can smell ya, ya little shit. No, you can't! Oh, fuck! I can! I can! Fuck! Fuck you, cocksucker! Wait the fuck up! Help me. Queen, you've got a little something on your face there. Mmm. Better? No. More here. What about now? Perfection, my queen. You're so good to me, sweet Nina. And you to me. Arvid, find the rest and hurry. I hunger and the night grows short. I understand. Come along, grandma. No, no, I want, I want, I want the blood. I want, I, I, I want the blood, I want the blood. Come. We'll find you some man meat. Man meat? Man meat? Oh, I love man meat! Arvid, it's nearly dawn. The goths will retreat. We have to end this now. I understand. What shall we do with the leftovers? They never keep. Prop him out. He could be useful. Oh, shit! Uh, hide somewhere. Oh, god. So did see you Ivan? Did he get away or? I don't know. I heard a scream. Oh, shit! Shit! I think it's worse. I think they got Bob. Oh, not Bob. Not Bob. First Lauren and Evan, Marco something-or-other, now Ivan's missing and Bob? We've gotta somehow vomit ourselves out of this situation. "Blood queen 4." Oh. "Blood queen 4." 1987. The blood queen returns to Los Angeles to hunt those who hunt her, taking the city on a wild ride that will soon not forget. Yeah, it's got that scene with the vampire dogs and that actress. Uh, what's her name? Quinley rod. Right, quinley rod. She was also in "hell basket." She did that thing with her boobs and the lipstick. Yeah, classic. Oh, instant classic. Scared the shit out of me when I was a kid. - Kind of turned me on. - Totally dope. What? Nothing. Okay. "Blood queen 4." I mean, how does that help us now? Bathtub full of holy water? Bathtub full of holy water. Right, okay. Don't we need a priest? - I'm ordained. - What? - Yeah, did it online. - Took like 10 minutes. Church of the midnight munchies. I'm a minister. That's, uh, that's really, uh- - handy? - Convenient. I know. Turn the water on. Let's get this ritual started. Ho-ho-ho! Max rampage! Rampage media! The largest distributor of independent horror on the planet! Jesus Christ, hurry up! Come on! Is that it? - I think so. - What? What do you mean you think so? It's my first time. It's fine. It's not fine! We based our entire plan around this and you don't even know if it's gonna work! Oh, shit! Quick, hide! Max rampage! You're a really shitty distribution company! - One down. - Five to go. Ugh. Plan? What? "Vampire holocaust." Oh, Italian! Directed by Mario pesulli, starring ilene cordacelli. Well, that's brilliant. That's, that's brilliant. Thank you. Ugh. Do ya, do ya think? Only one way to find out. Stinks! I think it... Got it. - All you. - Oh. Oh, fuck! "Vampire holocaust?" "Vampire holocaust." You got it, you got it. How does it look? Oh, ust great. Oh, come on. Suck it up. Geez. Get the other one. I'm bored. We have to find the interlopers. I'm hungry! You'll eat soon, grandma. I'm hungry now! What? Perhaps you should go to bed now. It's getting early. Fuck that. I wanna kill someone. You promised me man meat. So I did. Stay here. What? Man meat. I want man meat. I want man meat now. Man meat. Yum, yum. Have you found him? I, I've not. I don't understand. Did the queen- - turn me into a vampire? Of course, you fool. I am one of you now. I can smell your blood. You dare to question, oh shit. Hold on, these fucking things. They suck. Okay, I am a vampire! Aw! I think I got some in my mouth. It's gross. Yeah, well, you aren't the one with the rotten vampire teeth in your mouth. Oh! Christ, what? Stabby, stabby. "Vampire holocaust." It worked! I can't believe it. I'm very happy for you. Wait. Do you hear that? What? I don't hear anything. Exactly. The music. It stopped. But why? Dude, who cares! Let's go! - It's almost dawn. - I'm aware. If we can't catch them, then we've lost. What shall we do? We retreat. We live to fight another day. We are immortal. We have all the time in the world. This isn't the end, my love. It's only the beginning. My friend on the last slay ride Whoa. Lauren. Can you hear it, osh? The beat? The driving tempo? Fills your veins. It moves you. Come, lover. Sing this corrosion to me. Join me in this dance of death. Sway your body against mine. Live forever. Oh! "Vampire holocaust," bitch! Ah! My kidneys! God, you pushed me on the stairs. Lauren! Where'd she go? Who cares? Let'sust go. Yeah! Way to go, Bob! Best background actor ever! Come on! Let's get out of here, man! We're gonna get... But, I. Oh, Bob! Isn't fair. "The dead within," 1968. "The dead within," 1968. A brave explorer on safari through the darkest corners of Africa sacrifices himself to save his friends from the evil that threatened them all. The first black vampire. With Bella namoha and Jack labaron and Bob targon as the hero. Yeah, Bob. Bob targon, man. Bob targon's like my favorite actor. Do you know he got death threats for years after he made that movie? I read all about it in his autobiography. And that movie is actually a lot more important to the cinematic history of horror than one might think. It really opened the door for blaxplotation vampire films, you know? Like, uh, "vampula" and "ebony Vixen." Oh, I love "ebony Vixen." Right, "die, vampula, die." And the "African gods." Right, yeah. 1981. Although that's a little bit more of a voodoo-xplotation film than a vampire flick. That's true, I guess. But it still has vampires in it. Well, sure, but I mean, if we're gonna go by that criteria, then all of a sudden we have to start counting Dr. Night as a vampire. Of course he's a vampire! I'll miss you, Bob. You're the best, Bob. You're the best. You know, I was even gonna give you a couple of lines in the next film! You really, really earned it. Bye, Bob. Thanks for everything. You're the best. You were always there for us. You're very professional. You taught me so much. You're a good friend. You deserve more lines. You, uh, you had an impeccable fashion sense. You had a great smile. You were mostly clean shaven. You, uh, were a good driver? Oh, you were tall. Yeah, yeah. He was kind of tall. Uh-huh. You, uh. You. Shit. Well. He gave us the, ah, fuck it. I got nothin'. - Yeah, me neither. - Yeah. - Let's go. - Okay. I should've worn aacket. Yeah, what's the forecast? It's December. Ugh. Hey! Hey! Great, you made it. Well, duh. Clearly. Sorry for what I said about your acting. It wasn't that bad. It was golden. Shut up. So what now? "Midnight in the garden of blood." The reboot? The original, 1987? Oh, yeah. With Aaron Murray, frank delito, and Eve durden, right? Eve Parker. Eve durden was the "catness of black: Blood muncher," 1988? You sure about that? I'm sure. All right. "Midnight in the garden of blood." The survivors of a brutal vampiric attack decide to band together to snuff out the evil that escaped their vengeance. That's the one. "Midnight in the garden of blood." Pssshh! All right, put your seatbelt on. Where? Where? Where? Where is everybody? I can't be found sunset all around and the waves shine oh, fuck! Oh! Sunshine the place I go to feel truly free never caught or held down no storms around and the waves shine and your all mine in the wind I breathe sunshine I met with an old friend the other day she said she hadn't seen me in 13 long years I looked down on the tarmac and I said I haven't seen you in that long either we exchanged smiles and heartbreak and stories by the parked vans with bumper stickers and without word she said my husband left me and I'm raising these kids on a minimum three part-timeob and shit well, I hope you're doing all right with your life and I'm doing okay with mine, I guess well, the last time I saw you, we were thriving well, we were doingust fine well, I hope you're doingust fine I hope you're doingust fine I hope you're doing all right doingust fine, too I guess I'm doing all right myself, I guess sometimes I haven't seen my uncle in a shit ton of years and we know his heart stopped and he died and my grandmother, the one on my dad's side I have to remind her who I am every time I see her but I hope that when his kids have Christmas dinner each year they remember the way that I look and I said the things like that fire has a good log on it it's burning bright like grandma's eyes and I told my mom I like the way that she cooks I hope she likes the way that I cook, too and we have Christmas dinner each year and we'reust doing all right
