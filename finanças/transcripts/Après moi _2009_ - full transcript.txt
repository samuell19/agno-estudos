Like this, that's it. "After me" Put your arm a little higher. Less tense. That's it. It has to be flexible. OK, go ahead. Yes, perfect. Can I? Watch. Watch closely. -Sorry. -Sorry, Madam. OK, go ahead. How are you? That's good. -Hello. Higher. Put your arms a little higher. OK, stop the music please. We'll show you one step. Watch me. Take a step on the side and move. Like this. Always upright. And you pass. You got it? OK. The music... Always start with a frame. Take your time. Very slowly. I can't believe how different you are! You're beautiful! -Why, I was ugly in the past? -No, that's not what I meant. It's true that I was pretty but too big. Fatso... That's what you used to call me. -Yeah, I don't know, maybe. Now, you both stop this. Don't worry, I'm just kidding. You haven't change, though, you're still as beautiful. Well, your sister, her, is on time. -Dear... -What? We said: "11 at the airport." You could arrange your hair. You look like you did 3 hours of cleaning. -She hasn't changed either. -Unfortunately, no, I don't know how Dad can stand her. In Canada, I used to watch European news. I was like: "If they talk about a murder with an axe," "I'm sure Dad cracked..." Are you staying with us? No, I have many things to do. Please Jeanne, don't abandon me. I just arrived and you leave me in the cage? I'm in the cage every day, so if I can get out for once... We'll lunch at noon sharp. Don't be late. It's too early, Hugo has a show, he won't be done. Well, he'll have to leave early. Your Dad and I like to eat early. I really don't care, if you want my opinion... I've got to go. I have an urgent meeting. Come at noon sharp on Sunday. I'll make roastbeef, it can't stand late people! Why do you always startle me like that? I could have drilled your heart. -It would have been too bad. What is this? Er... Remember, we saw it at the store. I bought it today, it fits perfectly. But it was unaffordable. And I bought a hood, it's more convenient. OK... And you want to open a restaurant with all this food? Well, now that we have a stove, we should cook. Well, if it's that way... Pick a hand. The right one. OK, the left one. -Good choice. Here. So? -Well... Well, it's blue. Yes, it's blue. A little ugly. If you want, we can swap it for that one... which is not that bad. -Hugo, you're crazy. -Absolutely. -This one might cost a fortune. Who cares? Look. That's the way you put it. Can you look at me? What's the matter? You don't like it? You said that marriage is petty-bourgeois. Yes, but as I own the house that goes with it, let's just go to the end of the concept. Life is short, we won't live for ever. Thank you honey. This ring is beautiful. -Do you like it? -Yes. I wonder if I prefer that one actually. Which one? That one? Good, I have to give the other back. No way! We don't have to get married right away, no? Really? OK... I saw Sacha at the airport today. Canada was good for her, she lost ten kilos. Well, if she stays at your mother's, she'll gain that back in one week. That's why she was over there. You'll see her on Sunday, we'll go to my parents. Oh no, please... Not at noon. What about the blood test for the migraine? -Nothing, it must be hormonal. -Great. So, no more excuses. Yes, very good Gabriel. Now Jeanne, come close to the table. I'll stay seated. You keep dancing. We have eye contact. I stand up. I go to the centre. Keep dancing. Nico, you can stop. As I'm passing, you freeze. This is your signal too. We'll review the positions later. Very good. Don't move. Now... I'll stay in the centre with Jeanne. You guys stay in your positions. All of you. Good. Once we're here, we do our movement. We go back to the centre. Now, I'm going to turn around Jeanne. Look closely. When I'm close to you, it's your signal. It's your turn. It's your signal too. What's wrong? -Nothing. Sorry. I'll be back. Keep dancing. Go ahead. Keep dancing. Are you OK? -Yes, I'm fine. -Are you sure? -Yes, I'm sure. You want me to call a doctor? No, I'm fine, Hugo. Don't worry. I'm alright. You aren't pregnant, by chance? Unfortunately, no. Are you going to dance with me? Are you sure you don't want to talk in my office? No, your office depresses me. The bad news is enough, I don't need the fluorescent light and stuffy chair. At least here, I look less dead. Don't joke with this. And that's not what I said. I thought about it and the answer is no. Why do you refuse all treatment? Tell me it's going to heal me. That it's worth losing my hair, looking like an ugly dog, tell me I'm going to live. -I can't do that. I told you, your tumour is too far advanced. The treatment won't stop it. It would only prolong the d-date, if that... The side effects are difficult. -Then, no. What would you do if you were me? So? What would you do? I can't give you an exact date. It could be 3 months, 6 months... That's why you must hang on. I am fighting, I've never fought so hard in my life. That is life. That's being dead already. Have you told those close to you, your family? You know how it goes. If you tell people you have a brain tumour, leaving you with no chance of survival, your family can't handle that, they'll never look at you the same. But you can't hide it forever. And you can't live that alone. -I'll live the pain alone. I only want to share the good 'til the last day. The hardest part is not knowing that you're going to die. We're all going to die one day. No, the hardest part is to think about the people you're going to leave behind you, that we have to leave, give up our place. Someone else will take it. It's all the "after" idea that is so horrible. So I'm like an animal. I leave marks. I spent it all, I bought a stove, I made enough jam for centuries. I think only of leaving something behind, because after, I'll only be a memory. I can't force you to take treatment. -I'm not asking you to. Here's some morphine. You're going to need it. I don't want to abandon you, Hugo. Although I know one day someone will take my place, I don't want to imagine you loving another as much as me. I hope she'll love you like you deserve. Unless I find her myself. Hello. Hello Jenny. How are you? Since when you turn on the PC before the coffee machine? I'm looking for a candidate. -For who? -For me. For you... What do you mean? I decided to hire someone to help with the work at the house. It must be done in a month. A woman for the construction? Yes, why? Women work in this field also. You're having a feminist moment... It's not my business, but if I had a man, I wouldn't do that. It would be like being parachuted into a porno. You've been weird lately. If I had Hugo at home, I'd go put a brown bag over all the "hotties" of the neighbourhood. But that's just me. Exactly, I'll hire a woman anyway. -To each her own fantasy. OK, but you should hire a fat, ugly, cleft lip woman, with hairy armpits. -Hello. -Hello. Have a seat. I'm listening. -You have something for me? -Yes, administrative assistant. That's just the icing on the cake: there is another solution to get your smile back, a nose job and a chin lift with fat injections. Don't worry, with all that in your bottom, we can make you a nice smile. Jeanne? Are you listening to me? -Yes. There is another solution to bring back your smile. OK, let's go. Hold on. OK, I'm good, go ahead. OK? It's going to be fine. Hello. Give me a kiss or shake my hand... still thinking about it? Sacha? I said noon, it's 12:30. Hello Hugo. -Hello. These are for you. -Thank you. Hello, Mum. Hello, pretty lady. And Hugo. Finally, another XY chromosome in the house. That'll balance us out. OK, we can do it. -Dad. -Oh, thank you. Wonderful. -And one for each of you. -Thank you Sacha. Thank you. At the airport, I wanted something Canadian, but it was either this or maple syrup beaver pat√©. -It's beautiful. -At least, it's consistent. If Jeanne had been on time, and if your father could understand that cooking and criticizing ruin the dish... I warn you, it's burned so it's carcinogen. OK, thank you, just one. I'd like to avoid chemotherapy after lunch. You want some? -No, thank you. -What are you taking? -Just vitamins, they're easier to swallow. Your mother was always scared of doctors. I hope to get her at least the check-up they advised her to do. He's right, Mum. He always over dramatizes. I'll do these tests, when I'll get the time. -Actually, she's like our house at the lake: she's getting older, has a bad temper, but is so charming. -Is that how you see me? That house is a ruin. Who wants that shack? -Me. -Me. Excuse me... You want some? Let yourself be guided. Follow my steps. There you go, like that. That's it. Bravo! You're good. I thought you found that unfashionable. Yes, when I was 16. But I took lessons in Montreal with an Argentinian friend. Thank you. -I'm sorry. -Why? I know I'm unbearable, but I see your father getting older. I'm getting older too, like the house. You guys are getting older too. -Aging is beautiful. You'll see when you're my age. I'll never be your age... I mean, I'll never be as beautiful as you at your age. You're beautiful, Mum. And stop bothering Dad. He's the only man who can stand you more than 5 minutes. What is this? Why do you always rummage in my stuff? I had severe migraines, so I had some tests and they gave me that. Is it serious? It's nothing, Mum, trust me. They gave me that to help me sleep. OK, if you say so, I believe you. Here, the key to the lake house. Thank you, Mum. Jeanne... don't leave us without news that long. I promise. And if you want to go to the lake house... -I gave her the key. -Bye, Mum. No, Dad, no. No... -Bye, Hugo. -Bye. -Bye, Hugo. -Thank you. -Drive safe. -I will. This is it, stop here. Is this where you sleep? It's a little seedy, no? When I was a child, it was my dream to stay there. It reminded me the American series we used to watch. You know with Asian hookers and cops in wheelchair. It's like an old dream coming true. Any other romantic dreams? Except being in your shoes, kissed by Hugo, with the tongue, of course, no... OK, I've got to go or I won't get any hot water. -If you want to sleep at home... -Thank you, I'll be fine. Good night. I made friends with a cockroach named Sam... And I finally found the channel with porn movies... Ciao! -Sacha... -Yeah. Go in. I'll go find a place. Let's find it together. But you look exhausted. Go to bed, I'm coming. -I'd like this to never stop. I want to look for a parking spot with you endlessly. You're right, it's a dream. It's so romantic. I'll miss you. I don't like when you leave. The tango workshop is only five days. And it's not my first one. I'll be back next week. What's the matter, Jeanne? What's wrong? Nothing. This hormonal problem is eating my brain, that's all. No, that's not all. We always said we'd stay truthful. And I feel that you're hiding something. -I'm just tired. OK, let's go find a parking spot. Come on. You know these headaches... We thought it was because of my periods... Then we thought it was because of the air conditioning, so we closed everything at the office. It was like a sauna. I think Jenny even lost 640 grams... I actually went to a Doctor at the hospital. It's not because of the air conditioning or a hormonal problem, like I told you. It's... I can't do this. -Are you OK? -Yes. So, I need a shirt... You have something to tell me? Don't forget your toothbrush. Hugo... I'll miss you too. I promise, as soon as I'm back, we'll leave. We'll go get married in Argentina. We'll have the biggest tango room of Buenos Aires. Then, I'll stop dancing. And you'll stop the pill. What do you say? Yeah? The taxi's here. -Yeah. It's here. -Hugo... I love you too, love. See you soon. I'm going to die, Hugo. I'll be back soon. Hello, I'd like to see Sacha Kessler please. Excuse me, I'd like to see Sacha Kessler. She can't come now, she's working. -What? -She's working here. She'll be done at 4:00. Can you give this to her? Do you have an envelope? And a pen, sorry... Could you give this to her too? Thank you, goodbye. This... is fun. But this... is not cool. I can't accept your money like that. Would you accept a cup of tea? I've got green tea, bergamot, lemon. Or herbal tea, verbena, mint verbena, chamomile... Whiskey? Whiskey... With or without ice? Without. It's huge! You don't get lost? I want to finish the work. I'm so sick of this construction. That's why I'm looking for help. With work too, I'll never finish. You still pay in advance? It's not a salary. I'm not twisting anyone's arm. I just stopped by to bring you the ducks. And then you said "Oh, she needs money?" I didn't like the idea of you sleeping there and working too. In Montreal, I did all kinds of jobs to eat. That's great, then you can come work here. Paint? We haven't seen each other for so long, we can finally catch up. You're talking like we're all going to die tomorrow. In ten minutes, a comet could crash in the garden. It'd be so sad to never get to know each other. That being said, I'd rather screw a few screws than change dirty sheets. It's been a week, I can't take it anymore. There's a room upstairs. For now, it's a junk room, but if we cleaned it up, it would be really nice. I don't know. Here some towels. I'll put them here. That's all you have? -Yeah. Well, if you need anything, help yourself. -OK. -See you in a bit. You want to have kids? Not right away, but I think it's good not to wait too long. It's delicious, you're a natural. Are you kidding? It's so simple. Scrambled eggs are the most sophisticated thing I can make, it's hardly edible. You see, lots of things don't change. I can teach you. Cooking is not really my thing. So, do you want to have kids or not? -I could ask you the same thing. And you? -You know, my life is busy. Work, tango... We think we have all the time in the world and one day... Stop it, you're still young. You're talking like you can't have kids. No, I can have kids. Hugo wants them. That's great. Go ahead. What are you waiting for? It's beautiful. You must look like a diva in this. It'd look great on you. I don't perform in tango shows, it's too serious. Try it. No, it's too flashy. It's too... I don't know... too "woman". But you're a woman. And now, you have the body to go with it. Look. No, forget about it. Put it. -Why? -I don't know... I don't want to. You and your crazy ideas, I'd forgotten... First cooking lesson: the market. Are you sure? I'm not in the mood. Stop arguing. Let's go. You don't need to put my picture everywhere. I'm not moving in here. I'm just working. Come on, let's go. It's good. Hugo loves Italian food. But he hates Asian food, he's allergic to glutamate and cashews. Why are you telling me that? It's good to know. Hello. What do we need? Peppers... Oh, wine. Hugo loves Bordeaux. Saint-Julien and Pouillac. And? And... nothing. It's good to know. I wash everything at 40 degrees except Hugo's shirts, at 30 degrees. You do your laundry however you want, Jeanne. What are these? Five minutes, and it's perfect. Put in the zucchinis. There you go, you did it! All I need now is a guy who loves ratatouille, ratatouille and ratatouille. -Hugo loves it. -Yes, but he's taken. OK, I need to go to the cleaners before closing. Are you going to be OK? -Yeah, don't worry. I'm happy you feel at home. Why did you stop? Because I suck. I look ridiculous. -No, you're doing great. Stop it, I look like an anvil next to you. We all have to start somewhere. The first time I saw Hugo, he was in this dance studio, teaching tango to all these women. He was gorgeous. I wanted to be in his arms instead of them. Yeah, I tried it, not so bad... You see? See what? Let's go eat, I'm hungry. What kind of game are you playing? I'm not. You invite me here, and force me to do everything like you. You talk about Hugo all day, what's your plan? I have no plan, there's nothing. I haven't seen you in 2 years, I just want to be closer, get to know each other, that's all. What's wrong with that? OK, but stop making decisions for me. I do what I want. I am who I am. I'll never be like you, you understand? That I know. If you were like me, you would have done as expected. You always said no. You're lucky. I always wanted to be in your place. And me, in yours. Maybe we'll find the right one together. OK, let's go eat. I'm sorry, I thought it was Jeanne. I'm sorry. Here, this is for you, excuse me. -I already forgot. -Oh yeah? Paul Auster, Cunningham, Huston, Singer... I love them all. The last time I saw you before you went to Canada, I remember you were reading the pink library. And you smoked so much weed, your eyes were red like an albino rabbit. So you want some? Yeah. Jeanne didn't tell you I was staying here? Not really, no. You know, I understand if you don't want me to stay too long... and smoke all your weed. No, it's cool. It's nice having you here. Why did you go to Canada? One day, like that? Let's just say... to be polite, I was suffocating. My mum and Jeanne were suffocating, and me too. So I ate like pig. If I'd stayed, I could have entered in the Guinness Book title for neurotic obese. Seeing the results, you did the right thing. That's what I tell myself. I made 300 kilos of ratatouille. Jeanne said you love that. What is she doing? She should be home now. She ran away. She briefed me like she was leaving me head of the house. Yes, she's been acting quite weird lately. With all the provision she stocked, we won't die of hunger. Does she think we're going to war? I know, I saw it. Here. -Uh... Cheers. Wait, they taught me this in Canada. Put your arms like this and try to drink properly. -That's Canadian? -It's just funny. -I was stuck at work. I missed you, my love. What the hell are you doing, old lady? What are you doing? Did you kiss her? Just on the neck. I thought it was you. I'm here now. I'll always be here. -We won't be three forever? -No, we won't be three forever. Jeanne! Sorry, one person at a time. Only one person... So? The doctor just arrived. I must fill out her papers. Please, don't tell him anything. How can I explain what happened to you? I don't know, make up something not worrisome. -You're going to have to tell him. -Not now. Please. Fine then, I'll go get your discharge papers. I've been discharged, it was just low blood pressure. I'm not stupid. I heard everything. Jenny... I must say, if there's the slightest chance it will help, you should do the chemo If it worth anything... It won't work Jenny. I'm shot, you understand? I want to stand, I want to keep my hair. I want to look alive. -What about Hugo? I want Hugo to look at me like he always did, to love me how I was and am, not how I'll be if... I don't want anything to change. Jeanne, everything's changed. But I understand. That's not what I would do, but I understand. There's one thing I don't understand, Sacha. Why is she at your house? What the fuck are you doing? Hugo is going to find another woman. I don't want to disappear. With Sacha, I'm less dead. Jeanne... What are you thinking? Live in the moment, take advantage of life, with Hugo. Eat, drink, travel, have fun... I don't know... Have sex, dance... I won't be able to do that soon. What are you talking about? The doctor said all my symptoms are just going to get worse. That's where you're hiding. I've been looking everywhere. I talked to the doctor. She told me everything. Where would you have caught an ear infection? It's nothing! Let me kiss your ear. It's nothing. Come on. I'm not going to be able to dance, you'll have to replace me. They didn't give you any medicine? No they didn't. There's no medicine for this. Either way, it will be months before my balance is back. It's not possible. There's got to be something to help. That's ridiculous. All that for an ear infection. We can cure things now. -But not that. I want to dance with you, Jeanne. OK? I want to dance with you in this show. I could be there without being there. A piece of me but not me. What did they give her in the ER? What I mean is that... It could be someone who resembles me. No Jeanne, that's out of the question. OK? No, no way. Why? You danced the other day. We didn't, he showed me 3 steps. I'm not that good. You know Sacha, we've been practicing for months for this show. Take a dancer from the courses, there's tons. It's not that easy to replace you. How much do you want? Stop it. What are you doing? You're totally crazy old lady! Put your money away. Sacha, it would mean so much to me. I'll help you practice, you'll see, it will be easy. Say "yes". No. No way. Very good. Look at me. Jeanne, are you alright? "Breathe in the market", done. "Put my fingers in the dirt"... "Reread Joyce Faulkner." You'll never have the time. "Listen to Beethoven." "Make love with Hugo." Look at me. Don't stop looking at me. Keep looking at me. I'll bring you there. And... "Refuse" "9 missed calls from Jenny" That's good. That's it. Then... This is your signal. Sorry, let's go back to it. Keep dancing. And we were... There. I'm such an idiot. Throw out these flowers, it's sad. I ruined everything. What was I thinking? I was a coward, I was scared. But you did it for love too. I went too far. I'm tired Jenny, I'm so tired. Go back to Hugo and get your sister out of the house. -Do you want one? -Yeah. -Are you tired? -I'm exhausted. That's normal. We should go. Jeanne, you're beautiful. Really. We're not going to stay here tonight? That wouldn't be wise. What do you mean "wise"? I don't know. I've never known. Is this wise? It's not wise! Wise? Not wise? Not wise. Jeanne? She's not here. They're Jeanne's. Is Jeanne with you? What's going on? I'll tell you guys what's happening. Subtitles: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
