Moro Naba In the Niger loop, in a country without much relief, live 1.7 million Mossis. Cultivators, breeders sometimes, they live in villages scattered in this enormous savannah. On the roads that lead to the villages, to the markets, we come across caravans pushing donkeys or riding bicycles. The Mossi country was founded in the 11th century by a chief from the south, the Naba Oubri. And since the 11th century, no conqueror, Peul or Muslim, has made a dent in the integrity of the Mossi territory. The leader of the Mossis is the Sun King, the Moro Naba, whose palace stands in Ouagadougou, the current capital of Upper Volta. But one day, in November 1957, the Moro Naba Sagha, Emperor of the Mossis since 1942, died at 1:30 P.M. No one had the right to inform Ouagadougou that the emperor was dead. "The country is ruined", is all they could say. And the palace is empty. Empty, the throne from Ghana. Empty, the mat where the Sun King was sitting Empty the courtyard of the pages. Empty the bed on the terrace. Empty the saddle of the royal horse. In the shadow of the royal cheese maker, the circular tomb of Moro Naba Sagha had welcomed the remains of the Sun King, whose saddle will never again rest on the sunny stage, next to the zango, the hut of the palavers. But it is said that the body of the dead chief must first go around the whole Mossi country. A Sun King has died. And for 12 days will be held the great Mossi funerals. Each morning, at sunrise, the dignitaries, following an established protocol, gather in front of the West gate of the Moro Naba palace. The drums resonate so as to greet the exit of the dead emperor's eldest daughter. The eldest daughter who, during her 12 days of the funerals, will be the chief of the Mossi country. She wears the dead emperor's clothes, cap and cane. In front of her, the ministers, the Laralle, the Ouidi and the Kamsango make the Napoussoum, The ritual salute to the emperor. After the ministers, the family also comes to greet the eldest daughter. As soon as the Napoussoum ends, the eldest daughter returns to the women's quarters. The drums stop playing. The dignitaries and the family will receive condolences that will be brought to Ouagadougou. Today, the leaders of Ivory Coast are presented by the Prime Minister of Upper Volta, Ouezzin Koulibaly. The men of the family listen to his condolences. In the first row sits the eldest son. He will be one of the pretenders. The Ouidi are now opening the telegrams coming from all over the world. And it is decided communally, outside, because when there is no more emperor, there is no more room of governance. The acknowledgments are decided. But already, at the West gate, the sacrifices have begun. It's the dead emperor's nephew who fetches the pieces of wood that symbolize the arms of the deceased. He lays them on the ground so they receive the blood from the sacrifice. The earth is scrapped so the dust quenches the blood. It is the leader of the youth that leads the ceremony. The nephew holds a wooden gun upside down, symbol of the power of the deceased emperor. And then the sacrifices begin. The chief of a village brings a Moro Naba chicken. And the chicken must fall on its back to show that the dead emperor has accepted his last offering. After the sacrifices of the roosters, chickens, rams, bulls, those who could not bring an animal bring money that will be shared among the priests. Hunters come from many small villages of the bush. They brought old rifles from past wars. And everyday their shootings greet the departure of their leader. For 12 days, from all the Mossi country will arrive riding bicycle or on foot, the bearers of offerings. Rams, chickens, dollos, millet beer... The musicians will also come, to pay a last tribute to their emperor. In front of the West gate, some men are clearing the land, because it is there that great ceremonies will be held. On the penultimate day, at noon, the widows and the sisters of the dead emperor are preparing millet pancakes. Their number, symbolically must be the same as the age of the Moro Naba Sagha. The pancakes are placed on a tablecloth, next to the sunny stage. This is where, on the eleventh day, the Master of the Earth, who is also the Master of the Funerals, called Tengsoba of Pasani, sacrifices the roosters and the bulls. On the 12th day, Sunday morning, the dignitaries greet one last time the eldest daughter of the Moro Naba Sagha. Archers, hunters, horsemen of the Mossi country are now all gathered in Ouagadougou. The Baloum, head of protocol, drinks the traditional millet beer. However, in the Cathedral of Ouagadougou the missionaries are holding a mass so the deceased Emperor can rest in peace. The Moro Naba is neither Muslim nor Christian. He never wanted to convert. Although many Mossis are Catholic. After the mass, while the children are playing everyone rushes to the king's palace. For today, beside the new grave, the palace is open to all the Mossi people. Everyone can go there, play ritual funeral tunes. As a sign of mourning, the wives of the deceased are shaved. Their falling hair symbolizes the definitive rupture of the bonds of their marriage. All day long, water drums, ordinary drums, and iron castanets will resound. These funeral celebrations are also celebrations of joy. At noon, the people from Koubri mystically linked to the deceased emperor, make a sacrifice in front of the hole in the wall through which the body of the emperor came out to go all round his states. A rooster has been slaughtered. And three times, around the king's palace, the mask of the people from Koubri, the emblem of the masters of the Earth, and an effigy of Kaïcedra which represents both the dead emperor and the newborn, and the new emperor to be elected, circle in the opposite direction of the sunlight. After the 3rd lap, in front of the sunny stage, they stop. In this little statuette, dancing in the hands of the master of the Earth from Koubri, near the big mask, is probably sealed the soul of the deceased emperor. This soul is about to leave for a sanctuary in the bush that no one can locate. The dance of the people from Koubri is over. But before leaving, they have placed on the sunny stage a basket full of the gizzards from the sacrificed chickens. And it is the celebration of the end of the funeral. All horsemen from Ouagadougou, on this afternoon, are heading to the palace. They put on their war outfits. Outfits covered with magical charms that used to protect their ancestors, making them invulnerable to arrows and guns. In the palace's courtyard, in a straw shelter, lies the dead Moro Naba. Or rather his substitute. All the dignitaries are there, fully dressed. The youth leader went to the women's area to get the eldest daughter. The eldest daughter is still wearing her father's outfit, but also a war belt, and a yashmak around her face. And then comes out the dead emperor. His eldest son who is now wearing the great war costume of the Mossi emperors. He holds in his hand two linked spears and mounts the warhorse. The drums are playing war tunes. For a few moments, a few last moments, he is the Emperor of the Mossis leading his army. Cavaliers, archers, gunman, squires, common men and women, everyone gets behind the Emperor to defend him. And three times, they go around the plot. The dead emperor's nephew holds his horse's leash. And the eldest daughter holds the horse's tail. This is the Mossi army on a warpath. One lap behind, follow the people from Yatenga. The chiefdom of Yatenga and the chiefdom of Ouagadougou are rivals. But danger can bring them together. Every turn, the army grows bigger. The Mossi people want to show their emperor that they are ready to defend him. At the end of the third lap, the ride stops. A woman says: “Where is our emperor?" The emperor paused. Then, led by his dignitaries, greeted by the griots, he leaves for the bush. This symbolic death is the true death of the Emperor of the Mossis. And a woman shouts: "Our emperor is dead! He will not come back to lead us." Then, the best riders in the Mossi country are now galloping three times around the palace. They accompany, one last time, their deceased leader. Now truth can be told in the Mossi country. The emperor is dead. Until now, people would only say: "the country is ruined." Respecting the great ritual, this last ride must take place at dusk. Because the soul of the Sun King must leave at the very moment the sun sets on the horizon. The great funerals are over. All night long, the warbas, Mossi dancers wearing nets, will dance to the sound of the drums, the trumpets and iron castanets. However, the very same night, in Samambili, west of the palace, the dignitaries gathered. Guarded by their soldiers, their the horsemen, their gunmen and their archers, they will elect the new Moro Naba. They are waiting for the dawn, because the new Sun King must also come out the very moment when the sun rises. Here he is. The eldest son of the Moro Naba Sagha has been chosen. He is dressed in a cotton suit that was spun, woven and sewn in a single night by 22 young virgin girls. He carries bags under his arms bags, the Tipbos. Sacred emblems of the kingdom. He rides on a horse without a saddle. And if he drops the Tipbos, he won't become the chief. He is threaten,#threatened? but it's only a sham. The new Moro Naba is the true new leader of the Mossis. A dignitary shouts: "Here is our killer, here is our savior." The enthroned leader gets off his horse. The Mabila savant sits down on a root of the sacred fig tree, the Kankanga. The Baloum, Minister of the Protocol, takes place at his side. This ceremony is the submission of the dignitaries. The first, the Ouidi, comes on horseback and says: "The people of Ouaga are happy because they have a chief." "But they are like elephant shit..." "They are always full of thorns." Then Larlé says: "The people of Ouaga, whom you can feed," "will be loyal to you if you listen to our advice." The Gunga Naba, leading his troops, says: "You have just been enthroned, yet you look like a pile of garbage." "You will receive good things and bad things." The youth Kanaba says, we have nothing to say. "We have nothing to say." The accepted chief goes to savant Maliba's hut. The royal griots prepare their drums to reveal the Abiouré, the war name of the new Moro Naba. The leader of the griots says the first name. Good stones have their own place, if you try to move it, it becomes heavy. The first word of this sentence, kuguri, will be the name of the new emperor. "He who refuses to visit a good old man," "only harms himself." "Among all the fruit trees," "only the quince tree has as name." Then, joy breaks out. A bull was slaughtered and its tail was cut off before it died to greet the new Moro Naba. The Ouidi, the Baloum and the dignitaries discuss and joke. The youth leader makes mock attacks. A jester, to remind the chief that he is just a normal man, parody of the Napoussoum, the ritual greetings. This traditional ritual will be interrupted for a few moments. The Governing Council has requested the new Moro Naba to be presented to them. The Moro Naba Kougri, wearing the outfit that he should only have the right to wear at the end of the afternoon, returns to Ouagadougou accompanied by his ministers, his dignitaries, his griots, his soldiers and all his people. The administrative protocol is completed, The ritual will be resumed. In Samambili, at two in the afternoon, a horseman came to say that the road to Worodoro was clear. The Baloum comes out of his hut in Samambili carrying the Tipbos, the royal emblems, under his arms. The custom dictates that he walks from Samambili to Worodoro. But the Baloum decided to rent a van to make this journey of almost seven kilometers. In the van, in an aluminum suitcase, are placed Moro Naba's clothes. Because he has put on again his ritual costume made of cotton thread. Preceded by the Tipbos, mounted on a horse, with a saddle this time, the Moro Naba goes north. In fact, throughout that day, the new Sun King must be placed at the opposite direction to the sunlight. The center of the world is his palace in Ouagadougou. Thus, north of Ouagadougou, the Moro Naba will spend the hottest hours of the day. Children from the schools, hearing the procession passing, come and join him. The Worodoro Naba, the true master of the land of Ouagadougou, welcomes the procession. The Tipbos, still held by the Baloum go in first, followed by the emperor alone, for this is the place of the secret initiation. At the gate is the coronation stone. On the armchair covering the stone, the Moro Naba Kougri, who now has the right to wear royal clothes, sits down to receive the salute of his dignitaries and a calabash of ritual Zomkom, water mixed with millet porridge. He gives a sip of it to each of his dignitaries and has millet beer distributed to the people. But there is not enough for everybody. At four in the afternoon, everybody leaves. They leave, following the same ritual, to go to Paspanga. The procession passes by the north of the city in silence. Because the Moro Naba Kougri who has already received the submission of his dignitaries, who has revealed his war name, who was secretly initiated by the ruler of the earth, who sat on the stone of coronation, who wears the clothes of the chieftaincy, the Moro Naba Kougri will only really be the Sun King after having reached Paspanga, whose name means "the place where one acquires strength". He, who appears at the last ray of sunlight, as requires the custom, the Moro Naba Kougri is now the new Emperor of the Mossis. Thus, after a fifteen-day night, the Mossi country has regained its sun. The Mossi people have regained a leader. Subtitles: tadanobu@KG Proofeading: flipflink
