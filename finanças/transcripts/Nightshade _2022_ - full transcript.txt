Unlock the door. Come on, baby. Unlock the door. Let me open the door. Okay? Daddy's protecting you. Mommy is not a nice person. Honey, honey, open the door! Sorry. No offense, I just, I didn't love the whole hypnosis thing last time and I'm not sure I can do this again. I-I-I know it can be intimidating, but it's actually the most affective way to access those issues that are rooted deep inside the subconscious mind. You know, why don't we just catch up a little bit. I mean, it's been a while since our last session. Maybe we can try that a little later. How is Lucy? I think she's doing pretty good. She does a lot of yoga, and she spends an absurd amount of time in the garage painting, but. Well, the loss of a pregnancy is difficult for a woman at any point, but in the second trimester, it's really difficult. Just remember to keep treating her gently. I will. Well, I'm happy to hear that. So just the work related stress then? Being a homicide detective must be tough. Are you still experiencing insomnia? Well, no, not really. I mean, I guess I sleep now. I've been having these intense dreams. I wake up feeling exhausted, like I hadn't slept at all. Well, sometimes the subconscious mind uses dreamscape as a way to filter out issues, and that can be exhausting in and of itself, even though you're technically just laying in your bed. Right. I try to separate work from home, you know, but lately I can't escape it. I go to bed thinking about all the details of these murder cases and they follow me to my dreams. Okay. Well, we can of course discuss the more disturbing aspects of your job and that will help, but I really think we should continue with the hypnotherapy. Sleep depravation can be very dangerous for someone in your line of work, so, really, hypnotherapy is your best bet. All right. If it helps me get regular sleep, then, let's just do it. Okay. Lets get some of those disturbing images out of your head. Do I have your permission to start? Yup. All right. Focus on my voice and picture the numbers in your head as I say them. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15. Ben, what's your favorite color? Ben, if you could pick a favorite color, what would that be? Blue. Blue. And does the color blue make you feel happy? Yeah. Ben, why don't you tell me the details of the murder you're tracking. He was shot in the back. All his fingerprints were torched. Yoga again? Weren't you doing that last night too? You can never have too much yoga. It cleanses the soul. Come do some yoga with me before you go. Come on, it'd be fun. Ugh, I'm starving, I need to eat. Slept like shit again last night. More dreams? Yeah. Well, how'd your doctor's appointment go yesterday? Not sure. I don't really remember. Yup. Send me the address right now. I'm en route, I'll meet you there. Is everything alright? There's been another murder. Don't forget your tea. Oh. Thank you. Bye. Why can't people ever fucking die in the afternoon? That way we can discover them in the early evening, and I can actually have a decent morning with my wife. Good morning to you too. You look like a piece of shit. Drink your coffee and put a smile on your face for me. It's tea, asshole. I told you, I hate coffee. So what do we got? Ah, older male, Caucasian, floating in the pool with multiple gunshot wounds and a bag around his head. So why would someone shoot him, suffocate him, and then drown him? Sounds redundant. Right? Homeowner seemed pretty freaked out too. Says she's never seen him before. Of course she's never seen him. His head's in a bag. It's the same killer. His prints are torched off. Holy shit. All right. Listen up. Nobody touch anything. Let's get the forensics team back here ASAP. And somebody get me an ETA on the medical examiner. I don't know. I feel like I'm losing my mind. How so? Well, I woke up standing on my front lawn the other night. You woke up outside standing? Yep. I have no idea how I got there. My sprinklers came on and I woke up standing there soaking wet. My neighbor thinks I'm nuts, I'm sure. So you've progressed into sleepwalking? Yeah. I wouldn't call it progress, though, I'd call it fucking crazy. Have you ever lost time like that before? Not that I know of. And how does your wife handle your sleepwalking? Lucy sleeps like a rock so I don't think she's even noticed, and I haven't told her about it. Why's that? I don't know. I don't want to freak her out. Ben, you guys are a team and she's your partner. Don't you think that she would want to know if you're struggling? Yeah, I guess. It's just that she's still so fragile. I feel like we're just coming out of that dark place we were in. Why would I want to worry or upset her? Do you love your wife? What? Of course I love my wife. Listen, I-I just, besides the sleepwalking, I don't know, I'm starting to worry about myself a little bit. Okay. I want you to try not to worry so much. If you want to do a little research, there's a great shop downtown called the Cult Of Gemini. They have a large selection of books about the mind. It might help you to maybe learn about your dreams and see how your mind processes stress. So should we get started? Do I have your permission? Fine. Okay. Focus on my voice and picture the numbers as I say them. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15. Ben. Don't stay up all night spying on the neighbors. - Morning. - Morning. Can I help you find anything? Uh, I'm not sure. I've driven by this place for so many years, I figured I'd just stop by and check it out. Great. Well, take a look around. My name is Dawn. Thanks, Dawn. That's a good one if you're looking to read palms. Sorry about that. I didn't mean to startle you. You interested in telling the future? Aren't we all? Is there a real reason you came in to check us out today? I uh, I've been having these pretty intense dreams and I thought I'd look into it. It's probably nothing, but. Dreams are never nothing. I find more often than not that dreams are the soul's way of telling us things. Dreams are the keepers of the secrets that we keep from ourselves. Take this, on the house. Thanks. What is it? Black tourmaline. It wards off dark energy. Thank you. Have a nice day. Babe? Is something wrong? Everything's fine. Well, it's 3:00 AM. What are you doing in here? Just thinking about what if things last year hadn't happen. We'd be a real family right now if I hadn't lost the baby. Hey. Hey. We are a real family, Lucy. You and me. You doing okay? We haven't talked about this in a while. Yeah, I'm okay. I just think about it sometimes, and I've realized I have so much I need to do before I should be someone's mom, you know? It'll happen when the time is right. And when it does, you're gonna be an awesome mom. You sure you're okay? I'm not the one sleepwalking. Right. Well, try and get some sleep. At least one of us should. I just got back from a meeting with the chief of detectives. He said the two murder cases you guys are on have matching MOs. Is that true? Yeah. I was gonna tell you when we got out of here- Save it. If this guy leaves another victim in the same way, I'm gonna have the chief and the feds breathing down my neck. Sir, we're going over the evidence, but without being able to ID the victims, we're stalling out. We're running around blind until we get some DNA results back. This guy leaves nothing behind. Not a hair, not a shell casing, nothing. Well, what about a dental match? The medical examiner is on it but so far nothing. All right. Well, you need to get creative and figure it out. If you need anything at all, just let me know. But make it happen. Get me something. Well, see, I was... I swear, he hates me. Definitely. What's with this prick? No clue, but I don't trust dudes that don't blink. He's always got his eyes on me. Of course he does. He likes you. A lot. These wasps are at the peak of their prowess. Their queen is relentless. Her workers strong, her fighters are many. There's more killers. Defending the nest at any cost, the queen must protect her children from the unpredictable elements of nature. She shelters them from the brutal outside world. Soon, after battle, hunger settles in. She must feed her young. Their lives and the future of the nest depend on it. What's wrong? Nothing. I thought you hated those disco lights. Uh, I gotta go into work for a little bit. Right now? Yeah. You know, it's late but, I don't sleep anyway, right? Is everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, everything is fine. We gotta file a official report about what we found here, so I you need to think long and hard about how the hell you found this scene and do it fast. I told you, I had a hunch so I followed it. I'm telling you the truth, Becket. A hunch about what? About the victim? About the killer? The location? Come on, man, you gotta give me something here. Okay? Because this shit, this shit looks real bad. You got the whole team spooked. Hell, you got me spooked. Look, I had a feeling that something was here and there was. What was I supposed to do? Not call it in because you'd be freaked out? You know what good partners do? They trust each other enough to tell the whole story. There's been another murder. I saw it in my dreams this time. I saw it. They don't believe me, though. I don't think they trust me anymore. Who doesn't trust you? I just shouldn't tell anyone. Who doesn't trust you, Ben? They'll all think I'm crazy. Who will think you're crazy? My partner. My wife. They'll all think I'm insane. You think your wife will think your insane? Yeah. You don't trust her to be on your side? Wow. Uh, hi. Welcome back. How are you feeling? Um, tired. Is everything okay? Completely fine. Ben, have you ever heard of the incubus phenomenon? No. Well, an incubus is a demonic creature from mythology, and it's been recorded that it sits on the chest of a human at night, causing them horrible dreams, nightmares even. In modern day psychiatry, it's become the name of a disorder which basically describes waking dreams. So I'm awake while I'm dreaming? In a sense, yes. If I'm awake, then why can't I stop it? Well, because for that level of deep sleep, your body basically relaxes into a state of paralysis. And even though your conscious mind is awake, your body is still sleeping. It's a very common issue amongst people with extreme stress. But I'm not paralyzed. I'm, I'm sleepwalking. Right. Well, I think the sleepwalking actually is another issue altogether. And once we get a handle on the dreams, I really feel that the sleepwalking might stop. Listen, I wanna tell you something, but I'm not sure if I should. Ben, you can tell me anything. I'm here to help. I think I'm having visions, or premonitions or, or whatever and uh, I know this sounds crazy. Actually, it's not crazy at all. It's a lot more common than you think, it's just not talked about all that often. So um, you're having visions? Yeah. Just the other night, I saw something, so I got up and I drove there in the middle of the night. And sure enough, there it was. Ben, what can you tell me about this third murder? How did you know about the third murder? Well, you just told me while you were under. B-Ben, look, you don't, you don't need to be concerned. Everything you tell me is confidential. Okay, you know what? Actually, we're out of time. I would like to see you again tomorrow, but for an extended session. Okay? Yeah. Is someone at the door? What's going on? What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? You're outside walking around, grabbing the newspaper at 2:00 AM. What the fuck are you doing? What? Why are you at my house right now? What the hell is going on? Is everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. Um, anyways- -It was my fault, babe. I, I had my phone off and he'd been texting me all night. Yeah, honestly, I was just stopping by and making sure everything was, was okay. Okay. Well, do you wanna come inside? No, no, no. I should go. Yeah, I should I go. I already feel like an ass. I'm sorry. No. No, no, no, don't be. It-it means a lot, honestly. Thanks. All right, I'm going back to bed. Good night, guys. Good night, Lucy. You always shower in your socks? Hi. Do you remember me? I was here a few days ago. Yes, I remember you. What can I do for you? Listen, I noticed that you locked the door after I left the other day. You were scared of me or something. Why? It was closing time. But it wasn't. You had three more hours according to the sign in the window. Look, I've been seeing some weird shit lately. Please just help me. See those candles? Yeah. Watch. Now you try. All I can say is that everything in this shop is cleansed and blessed, meaning that it all carries positive energy. You seem to be charged with an incredible amount of negative energy. Here. Shuffle and cut with your right hand. Tarot cards? Do you want my help or not? Draw three, face up, and lay them in front of you. Are those bad? See this? The tower card indicates a catastrophic change in your personal life. A deeply personal betrayal. What, is my wife cheating on me or? Generally the cards tend to lean more towards the spiritual side. Less literal. The devil card indicates a destructive force, a lack of humanity, carnal desire for the destruction of others. And this one? Reversed judgment. Means a loss of freedom or control. Okay. What does it all mean? There's a darkness surrounding you. Something is brewing inside. You've been betrayed in some way that's left you open to the dark. The cards never lie. How do I fix it? Please, just tell me what to do. You find the source of the betrayal. What's causing the darkness, the dreams. Only then can figure out how to banish it. What in the actual fuck, man! I almost shot you. I almost shot you. Look, I don't know! I don't know. I don't know what I'm doing here, I swear! The fuck you mean you don't know? It's one o'clock in the morning and you're snooping around my goddamn backyard. Look, I don't know. I swear I don't know. I've been seeing weird shit, I've been having crazy dreams, and, and sleepwalking! Something is up. Something is wrong with me. Sleepwalking? Listen. Just listen. I woke up standing on my front lawn the other night, Becket, and I woke up in the shower when you came to my door last night. Ugh. I'm all fucked up man. I've been seeing a shrink about it and I'm trying to work things out. Look. Nobody is gonna believe this. Nobody is gonna believe this bullshit, Ben. Becket, I'm telling you, I keep seeing these things in my dreams. Right? I keep seeing them and they're real. You know what? Okay. Okay. It's all happening. Then I'm gonna need you to take a lie detecter test. All right? Or something because this is some bullshit. Look, I don't know what to tell you. I'll take the lie detecter test, but please, don't tell anyone I woke up in your pool. All right? Please. You're gonna owe me coffee for a week, Becket. Yeah, I know. Maybe a whole month. Supposed to be off the record. I'll take care of you. Thanks for coming over so late. You know we don't even do these things anymore. Whatever. They work. Okay. I need you to stay real still. We're gonna run through a series of questions. No movement while we conduct this, okay? What's your name? Benjamin Hays. How old are you? 37. What color is this pen? Red. And we are at Detective Becket's house right now? Yes. Okay. Great. Let's begin. Did you know what you were doing when you got here tonight? No. Have you ever shown up at Detective Becket's house unannounced? No. Did you come here tonight with the express purpose of hurting Detective Becket? Of course not. You trust Detective Becket? Absolutely. With my life. Are you on any medication? No. How did you find the location of victim number three? I saw it in my dream. Do you think you're psychic? Yes. I do. Are you in any way connected to the three murders that have taken place this last week? Yes. I'm a detective on both murder cases. Okay. I got another question. What were you doing at the occult store downtown? I'm learning to read palms. Oh come on, I'm kidding. I'm making my rounds. I was there asking questions, digging around. It's practically across the street from the crime scene. Okay. One final question. Do you feel like you've deceived or tricked Detective Becket or myself during this polygraph? No. Okay, he's, he's telling the truth. Okay. Ah. I just got back the DNA results, along with the full medical records of all three of our victims. Guess what? Tell me. All of them have something very interesting in common. Not only are they very shitty ex-cons who were recently paroled, but the medical records show that they all saw the same counselor. Check it out. Dr. Amelia Collins. That's my shrink! Are you serious? Holy shit. I-I knew something was up with her. How much have you told her? Shit! I mean, she's been hypnotizing me, Becket! Who knows what I've been telling her? You can't remember? Well, I'm not exactly conscious or in control when she's doing it. Shit, I mean, she knew about the third murder before I knew I had even told her. Oh come on. Really? She's in your head man. That's not good. I'm telling you right now, something is up with this lady. She's got you sleepwalking and thinking you're psychic. Right, who knows what kind of shit she's filling your head with while your hypnotized. There's only one way to find out. Wire me up for my therapy session with her today. Okay. Focus on my voice and picture the numbers in your head as I say them. 15, 14, 13, 12, 11. Ben, what's your favorite animal? Cows. Do you ever dream about cows? Yeah. Are you sleeping better lately? No. Are you still having nightmares? Yes. Are you still having premonitions? Yeah. What are the latest details of the murder cases you're working on? We got the DNA results back from the lab and ID'd the victims. They were all bad people. Bad people? Yes. And do you think that these bad people deserve to die? Yeah. Who do you think is killing these bad people? You are. Oh shit. Oh shit. I-I'm sorry, uh could you elaborate on that? All the victims were your patients. Um. Is there anything else you'd like to share with me? I'm wearing a wire. Shut the fuck up. Is everything okay? Mm-hmm. Is there anything you'd like tell me, Detective? Tell her, tell her everything, Ben. Tell her you're fucking social security number. Tell her every goddamn thing. Uh, no, I don't think so. I feel pretty good. Ugh. What do we think. What? I-I'm sorry, uh could you elaborate on that? All the victims were your patients. Um. Is there anything else you'd like to share with me? I'm wearing a wire. Suffice it to say, undercover is not your thing, Hays. Amen. Sir, in my defense, I was under deep hypnosis. I don't care if you were under hypnosis, a spell, or a Taiwanese hooker. You never admit to the suspect that you're wearing a wire! Or that the suspect is a suspect. Everything you've got so far is circumstantial at best. But you heard the recording, sir. She was clearly pumping him for information about the case. And sir, all three victims were her patients. I'm not saying it's not her. What I'm saying is don't have shit to show me yet. She covered her ass. Look, there are a couple of Facebook posts of her making creme brulee. You know what she uses for that? A tiny little blow torch. Just perfect for burning off fingerprints! Let me explain something to you. Number one, she's a therapist. It's literally her job to pump people for information. Number two, it could absolutely be a coincidence. She's sanctioned by the state to exclusively work with parolees and police officers. And number three, there are thousands of people out there who make creme brulee, and they probably all have little blow torches. You've got nothing. Hays! Are you fuckin' sleepin'? Look, go home and get some rest. And the two of you, don't come back in here until you've got some real evidence to show me. Some DNA, some fingerprints, some videotape, something. Yes, sir. See? He hates me. All right. Um, let's circle back and start from square one, go through the details again and hopefully something will add up. I've sent you all the new information on our murder victims. Let's just go through the files. What is it, Miss Cleo? You having another vision? Get fucked. Okay. Tell me what I'm gonna eat for dinner tonight. A big bowl of dicks. Ah, see, I knew you were a fraud. She didn't sound surprised at all when I told her point blank that she was the killer. And why would she ask me if I thought that bad people deserved to die? Let's dig into her. See if we can figure this shit out. Can I help you? Sorry for just dropping in on you like this. I owe you a huge apology and I just, I wanted to come and break the ice and talk to you about everything one on one. I'm sorry, sir. I have no idea what you're talking about. Do we know each other? Are you being serious right now? Who gave you this address? Are you okay? Sir. Are you okay? Lucy! You're home early? You know her, don't you? What? Who? My fucking shrink, Lucy! You know her. Don't lie to me! She drinks your special tea, Lucy. You know, the special tea that you make by hand? The special tea that you pour down my throat every morning? What are you saying? You two know each other. You know my shrink. I feel like I'm going insane. This is what happens to people when they don't sleep. They lose their fucking minds, Ben! Look at you! Anybody can buy one of those empty tea bags, and fill it up with whatever they want. Ben, this is just a coincidence. You need to sleep. This is all in your head. She didn't even recognize me. I'm going insane. What? She didn't recognize you? She acted like she'd never seen me before. Please, I'm telling you, something's, something's wrong. You need sleep, babe. Get a full night's rest and tomorrow we're going to a real doctor. Please, let's get you some help. You're scaring me, Ben. How is Lucy? Do you love your wife? Well, the loss of a pregnancy is difficult for a woman at any point, but in the second trimester, it's really difficult. It's not only she started to feel the baby in the womb inside of her, she's also been inundated with hormones. Just remember to keep treating her gently. Okay? Just focus on my voice. Picture the numbers in your head as I say them. 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15. Ben, what's your favorite color? This is what happens to people when they don't sleep. They lose their fucking minds, Ben! Look at you! Anybody can buy one of those empty tea bags, and fill it up with whatever they want. Ben, this is just a coincidence. You need to sleep. This is all in your head. Oh fuck! Oh fuck. Oh my God. Oh fuck. Fuck. What the fuck. Just relax for a bit, you've had a long week. What the fuck. Gets worse if you fight it, honey. Just relax. What the fuck. I didn't want to lie to you, Ben, but you weren't ready to know yet. It's a lot to take in, babe. I'll make sense out of all of this, I promise. I finally figured it out, Ben. What? How to be a hero. I've been watching you struggle through paperwork and bullshit bureaucracy for years. You bust your ass to bring in the bad guy and half the time they walk and get away on a technicality. What the hell are you doing? Babe, don't you see? This is how we can make a difference, bring the bad guys down for good together. We make an amazing team. You're fucking crazy. But let's be honest, there's just too many criminals out there. You're never gonna make a difference chasing bad guys around all day, silly. What are you talking about? There's a lot of sick people that need to die, babe. Listen, Ben, I want you to be my partner in this. What? When I lost the baby, you took care of me so well. I lost myself there for a while between the grief and the hormones, ugh, but you, you helped me find my way back to who I am and who I'm supposed to be. You're crazy. What are you talking about? Our job as parents starts now. It's up to us to make this world a safer place for our future children. If we trust each other completely, you know, we could make an unbeatable team. You make me better, you make me stronger. Listen, I've put together a pretty extensive to-do list for us. I went through and red flagged countless files from Dr. Collins's therapy freak-show. I knew it. You've known her all along. I stopped by her house and introduced myself, yes. Yes? And what can you murder? Ben, you can tell me anything. Do you love your wife? What? And really, Ben? Cows? Since when have you liked cows? Listen, I've got a list of freaks that need to go. I've narrowed it down to a select few, well, 100. What? They're all pedophiles and rapists, Ben! They're really bad people. Except for your cop buddy in the trunk. What? He's been getting too close to us. He's been watching us. You're just as sick as they are, Lucy! You're the one who needs the fucking shrink! You don't know this, Ben, but my father murdered my mother. I was six when he buried her in my backyard. I was six. Just a baby. Apparently my dad wasn't supportive of a woman owning her own power, so he brutally murdered her. I thought when they put him in prison it was for good. He was supposed to die in there. But no, they let him out. My mother's life was worth 30 years. 30 years, how sad is that? So you killed him? Oh, no, no, honey. You did. What the fuck have you done? A lot. A whole lot, Ben. What do you think I've been doing in here painting? This was my mother's box. She was into some pretty powerful stuff. It took me a long time to fully comprehend what's in this box. Most little girls play with dolls. My mother, she taught me how to play with power. Real power, Ben. I'd forgotten all about it until last year when we lost the baby. And it all started coming back to me. And what the fuck is in that tea? Just something to help you and Dr. Collins keep an open mind. I want you to know that I love you very much. And I just think that we could make the best team and I hope that we can seriously find a way to make this work. I know you don't believe in all this silly stuff, but let me show you how powerful it really is. What is it doing? Lucy! The fuck did you do? Now, don't get twitchy, baby. You won't even feel it, trust me. I normally do this when you're sleeping. I'm not so fragile now, am I? Just sit tight. I have to go into your work today. It's gonna be nice to see where you spend all your time. Oh wow, never seen you here so early. Please tell me you got some sleep? Excuse me? Did you even sleep at all? Oh, uh, not really. Is that a cup of coffee in your hands? And dear God, are you drinking it black like a man? I'm proud of you. Yeah, I just forgot my tea. Oh, well, Lucy's gonna have your ass for that. I'll have you know that my wife is a very understanding person. Yeah, whatever. Well shit, since you're here, let's hit the range. So did anything hit you last night when you were going over the evidence? 'Cause I got absolutely nothing. Yeah. I did have some thoughts and I made a bunch of notes, but of course I left them at home. Wait, you made notes? Jesus Christ. Lack of sleep is really changing you, man. All right. Go for it. Are you serious right now? You shouldn't even be operating a gun this tired! Holy shit, nice work. When did you start shooting left-handed? You don't ever practice shooting left-handed? No. I don't even think I could hit the target. Shit. All right. Look, I'm about to take a piss. I'll be back. Damn it! Come on! You've gotta be kidding me. Yo. You ditched me, asshole. Oh, I know. I just had a thought but I think I'm gonna have to go back to the house and get my notes after all. I might just head back, do some work from home. Hey! Catch, asshole. Thanks. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What the fuck is going on, Ben? Lucy, Lucy! Hey! What did you do to her? What have you done, Ben? I've done a lot, Becket. I've done a whole lot. What are you talking about? Come on, they were all bad people! Don't you think bad people deserve to die? How did you pass the lie detector test? Answer me. We can get you help. Okay? Let me help you. Let me help you. Lucy loves you, and I fucking love you, man. You're my brother, but I need you to put that fucking gun down. I need you to relax. Okay? Relax. Cuffs, okay? I need you to put these on so we can go get this shit figured out right now. Sorry. We're better than this. Lucy tried to help me, but there's nothing she could do. Crazy is crazy and I'm way past the help part by now. No. No, Ben. I'm just gonna make it all go away now. And hey, I'll finally get some sleep. I'm so sorry, baby, change of plans. Ben, listen to me. Listen! No! No! No! Fuck! Ben. No! I'm sorry. Now, it's okay. Come on, come on, come on. No. I got you. Come on. No, no, no. Lucy, come on. I got you. I got you. Come on. He-he lost his mind. He kept saying crazy things- - I know. - like he was killing people and he was never gonna stop. I'm so, I'm so sorry. And then I tried helping him, I tried. He started seeing the shrink and it only got worse. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
