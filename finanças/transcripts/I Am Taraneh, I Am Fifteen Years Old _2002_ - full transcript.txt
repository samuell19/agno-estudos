No, I don’t know now to wrap the diaper. I don’t do it correctly by It makes a mess everywhere. It’s very easy, give me the diaper. Oh, cutely, what is her name? Shh, she’s asleep. What’s her name? I haven’t found any names yet. What do you mean? We have a lot of names, Assal, Nazanin, Shirin, Ava, Golnaz… what do you suggest Maryam? Arezou, name her Arezou. Do you give her your breast milk? Of course. Then you have to have cow bone soup At least once a week. Cow bone? Yes, it is very good for the baby. Why didn’t you bring your child? I don’t have a child anymore. She gave her to the orphanage. I couldn’t take care of her anymore. Taraneh, can we spend the night here? I won’t steal anything. If I did, don’t let us in there anymore. Why are you coming here again? No, maybe sometimes. When we have nowhere to go. We can leave if you want. Her stomach hurts. You haven’t slept? I can’t sleep, do you have any stomach syrup for the baby? But it’s not morning yet for you to leave. I want to go, I can’t bare it, Her breath, her warmth, her cries, All remind me of her, I don’t want to regret what I have done. What was her name? I chose Arezou, But I don’t know what her name is now? Give her to me; give me the child. Why did you give her to the orphanage? It was useless, I shouldn’t have kept her in the first place. No body accepted me with a child Even my mother. Go, all the hardship that I went through Was enough for me. Nobody even gave me a house I don’t know how you marriage to get one. Especially in this neighborhood, They have 3 mosques have. Why did you keep her in the first place? I didn’t want to But I had no money for abortion. When she was born I couldn’t let her go. I love her but what was the use? What about her future? I didn’t even dare to get in ID for her. Why? What would her father’s name be? It would be evidence against me and It would have been worse for the child. Do you know how upset she would have Got when she had grown older? This way she might have a chance to become fortunate. She would be educated and have and ID. What do you want to do about her ID? I don’t know. Do you want to keep her? She’s my child, I love her. Then you will get an ID as well. I have to. Oh please, Till now the baby wouldn’t let us sleep and Now that she’s silent you won’t let me sleep. I have a date tomorrow morning. Either forget about the ID or If you want to get it, Get it in her father’s name. This way it would be obvious that You had a husband. Taraneh dear. Aren’t you coming up Mr. Mohseny? No, it’s okay here. But it is not right. I thought that something has happened that You don’t come to get the minibus rent. Then the boy’s mother came, What was her name? Mrs. Keshmiri. She told me what’s going on. I didn’t want to bother you Because you had hidden it from everyone. Have they accepted the child? I mean Mrs. Keshmiri. No, I mean I don’t know. Have they come to see you at all? No. They won’t accept her. The day she came to agency She spoke in a way as if… …she wanted to help you as charity. I don’t need their help. What did your father say? I haven’t told him yet. Taraneh, does she really belong to Mrs. Keshmiri is son? Of course Mr. Mohseni. Did the Minibus break down again? No, it is okay. It still works But money has to be spent on it. Taraneh, who are these girls that Come and spent the night here? They are my friend, They came here only twice. What do they do? I told them that they are your classmates But I heard that they are not students. To whom? The landlord, he wants his house back, But the contract date is not over, yet, Wasn’t he a friend of yours? His neighbors have asked him. I asked him a lot but he didn’t accept. Well, a girl your age, All alone with a child, It would have been good if one of Your relatives would come and stay with you. He has given some time. Go and see to your child. But I am not leaving here Mr. Mohseni. Do you want the neighbors to start bothering you? Isn’t he your relative? Give his address to me and I would talk to him personally. What do you want to tell him? What do you want to prove? With what evidence? Does the child’s ID have her father’s name in it? Do you have a husband in your own ID? You want to tell him that An intimacy was pronounced between you? He didn’t believe me let alone you. If it weren’t for the 40-year friendship that I have with your dad I wouldn’t have believed you as well. This is for our child, now go see What right? Didn’t I tell you that Such girls have not rights at all? I haven’t come to get something Which is not mine. I want to register her father’s name in her ID. This the problem. Whoever is mentioned in her ID as her father has to answer her tomorrow. When she grows older, he would be come. Responsible for the inheritance. She doesn’t want any inheritance. But she has to have a father’s name, Isn’t this her right? Of course, but why don’t you understand How could I be sure that she in my son’s child? Then whose is it? This is exactly what I am asking tell me so it a he or a she? Dear judge, An intimacy had been pronounced between Amir Hussein khadem and I. Khatam… Excuse me khatam on the condition to get permanently and Officially engaged after we finish our schools What was the notary’s name? I don’t know. What do you mean? Did you get an intimacy letter? No, I mean you, but he kept it, I didn’t need it anymore. This is necessary, it is considered evidence. To be on the safe side we even have to bring the man… …who pronounced the intimacy to court. Can you bring him to the court? The more witnesses you have The more rights you would be given. Hello. Hello. Sir, the day that the divorce was done Did you ask if she had any claims or not? And did she answer yes or not? Yes. And I paid the dowry as well. I didn’t know that.. Did she have any claims When she was getting her dowry? No, sir I even emphasized and asked her If she has any claims or not. Now how could I believe what she says? Listen sir, this child is 2 months old now. Her birth date doesn’t match The date of the intimacy letter. He was a witness. Well the baby was born soon. Do you have a medical report that Shows the baby was born soon? Yes. I can’t accept this sir. I feel sorry for her as well. Her father is in jail, Her mother has passed away, She doesn’t have anywhere to go, I understand her situation. She needs help but… What can I say? Ask her where she works. In marriage ceremonies, photo shops Restaurants, Is it appropriate for a girl this age to work. Is such place? Believe me sir, These were cases that even old women didn’t stay healthy in such places. You know what I am talking about You have seen the conditions of these girls in the streets. Girls who would do anything to save themselves when they get into trouble. We have examples of then in our own organization every day. Your complaint has been written incorrectly. This lady, Mrs. Kashmiri has nothing to do With this case . You have to sign a complaint Against Amir Hussein Khatam. At the time being you and This child have no right Unless you could introduce Amir Hussein khatam to the court and… …prove that he is the father, Or you could submit the result of His blood test. Which has been approved by The Iranian Embassy in Germany to the court. I want Amir’s address do you have it? No, I don’t and even if I had it I wouldn’t have given it to you Leave him alone. For God’s sake. I will see his uncle tomorrow and I would get the address for you. Thank you. The intimacy pronouncement of a woman Whom has become intimate is correct If she doesn’t know that She has no expense rights. A woman who has become engaged To a man temporarily… …would not inherit anything from the man and The man would not inherit anything from her. But the intimacy is permanent Between the father and child and… I don’t understand these. Yes dear, Hush hush Don’t cry, dear. They won’t accept you well The hell with them. You are my dearest, you are only mine. I only have you in this world, Hush hush. Well it happened any ways, I knew that I am making a mistake In the first place. Leave them alone Taraneh. Why? You are not after their inheritance one you? No. Then leave it, stick to your child, Think about your child’s future. Don’t depend on them. Depend on God. You are young, You still have time. Start all over again Get married. Forget about the past. Let everyone see you and your child with a father from now on. If you want to go on with this argument You’ll ruin your future. Do something to make your father happy as well. Do you have any news from him? No, has anything happened? No, don’t worry, he is okay. Someone wants to propose marriage to you And if you agree Everything would be okay. Who is he? He came here and spoke to me He is a good man. He is a hard worker, He has enough money. He has his own house and life, He works and has a bright future. He knows everything about you and He has accepted it. He even said that if you agree He would like to get… … the child’s ID in his own name. Have you spoken with the landlord? Yes, I did. If your neighbors don’t complain, He wouldn’t ask you to leave. Hello. Hello. My mother wanted to talk to you. She is so pretty. Who was that Mr. Mohseni? Who? The one you found for me. A worker in Keshmiri’s shop!! You fooled me. You fooled me. You are on their side as well. You all want to get rid of me. I was so stupid to believe you. I thought to myself that Mr. Mohseni wants my well-being. I was so stupid to forget about The complaint I made. I swear to God I want your well-being… What well-being? You wanted me to marry with A worker of Keshmiri’s shop… To leave them alone? But now I won’t have them alone, I will disgrace her. This isn’t the story sir. My son left by his own will. After he divorce I did everything To keep him here but it was no use. After this lady told me that she is pregnant I called him and I spoke to him But he didn’t accept. Why isn’t he willing to send His blood test results then? Why don’t they tell him to send it? If they are right, if the baby is not his, He could send the test results to prove it Why are they accusing me? I don’t know if you have a daughter or not But nothing is more terrible for a girl… Than being accused. Would you ask this man why he came and Proposed marriage to me? Please sit. Rise. Yes sir, Mrs. Keshmiri asked me to go. Did you get anything from her? No. sir. Did she promise anything? No, nothing. I just wanted to do a good deal. I just wanted her well-being. Sit down sir, Now what do you want my girl? I don’t know much about the law like Mrs. Keshmiri. I don’t know much about religion. I bought some books to learn something. For today but it was no use I didn’t understand anything. Well how should I say it, You know sir, nobody would believe that I am a mother as well… …like all other mothers I have gone through hardship They have done something to me that I haven’t been able to go and… …see my father for a long time. I am embarrassed to go and see him. But what have I done to feel embarrassed? End of the court session, We would have a 30 minutes break and… …then the court would announce the find sentence. If has been proven to the court that Taraneh Parnian has been the wife of… … Amir Hussein khatam, As for you Mrs. Keshmiri As a substitute parent, You right would be protected To be able to sign… …a complaint in opposition to this sentence After offering an approved blood test result… … to be court. Name? Naghmeh. Surname? Parnian Mothers name? Taraneh Parnian. Father’s name? She doesn’t have one But according to this certificate Amir Hussein Khatam Is the father of your child. Yes, and I really tried hard to get this paper But she doesn’t have a father’s name. There I would leave this space empty. Good bye. Why did you do this Taraneh? Naghmeh does not have a father And your kindness is not enough for her. If one day Amir wants, he could come and get an ID for her. Taraneh. Yes dad? Tell me about her. What do you want to hear? I have already told you everything. Her ID is under my name, Nagmeh Parnian. Great. Will you forgive me dad? What is hat supposed to mean? You are my child, only my child, You are my daughter. A daughter who has her own house and life. When I get out of here Where else could I go to but your house? Bring the child near. Smile Naghmeh, smile for grandpa, I don’t know why she isn’t smiling She will, she will. Why are you laughing dad? When you are 20 years old Your child would be 5 little mom. She’s laughing, dad she’s laughing.
