My name is Archibald. Archibald Suchot. I'm an engineer, and I spent 10 years in Africa building all sorts of useful things. And it is far away, in the very heart of Africa, that this story begins. No, this isn't Africa, it's Connecticut, where I was living before I mysteriously disappeared. But that's another story, which my grandson will be able to tell better than me. He's a charming little boy who goes by the name... Where's he got to now? What's happening to me? You are joining our brothers, the Minimoys. - I'll do my best. - Good luck, Arthur. Welcome to the land of the Minimoys. My darlings, it's time for you to show who you really love. One last kiss but that's all. Stop it, that's enough! Romeo, let her go! On my signal, let Romeo go. On your command! No, not that! - I think we've been spotted. - About time! Come on! Jean, stop it! You know she's allergic to bees. I promised that every Sunday I would bring you a chocolate tart. Enjoy! That was so good! Tired now. Come on, kids, I promised your parents you'd be in bed by 10. Beddy-byes, everyone, let's go! You too, the film's finished. Come on, bedtime. To bed with you! Have you had a nice birthday? Yes. Thanks, Mummy. Good. - Mummy. - Yes? I know what I want to be when I grow up. Already? That's good. What, a cosmonaut? Better than that. A Minimoy. You're too big, they're all this size. I'll go down the shrinking telescope. Okay, it's a deal. But first you have to go to sleep. Goodnight, children. Sweet dreams. 10 YEARS LATER... Stop! Shit! That way. Doug, there's never enough ice. I've factored 15 cubes per person, ready in 7 minutes. - Are you sure? - Yes. I'll get the cakes out of the fridge. - Hi, girls! - That joke's getting old. You sound like a total oaf. I am! I sell white goods, watch football and drink beer. The beer's fine! Hi, my loves! You look gorgeous. - I'm so happy to see you. - Us too. You're very peace and love. What's going on? It's because I think it'll be the trend this summer. - It suits you, anyway. - Thanks. - Where's the hero? - Late, as always. We've brought cakes. Seriously, you've brought cakes too? The fridge is full of cakes! - Everyone brings the same things. - What a moaner! - Well, it's my home. - Only a third. Knowing your alcohol problem, we thought there'd be nothing to eat. I've made crÃªpes! - How sweet! - You're the nicest, we all know that. What happened to you? I'll get you some water. Not the ice! - All right? - Yeah, and you? Come on, then, tell us. I forgot my ticket, so I jumped over the turnstile. The cops grabbed me. And the way I'm dressed, they wanted to haul me in. Here. A beating for sure! On his birthday too. It's great that everyone's here. - Not everyone. - Who's missing? - Yeah, who? - The princess. Oh, yes. That must be her. Shall I go? Excellent! You like it? It's great. But you've really changed. - Really? That much? - Yeah, yeah... You saw me at Maxime's birthday. Six months ago. - What, have my breasts grown? - No, it's not that. I think it's the make-up, the costume... Yeah, okay, your breasts too! You look great. Oh, sorry! Let's make your big entrance. All right? Friends, it's Princess Selenia! So well done! Give us a twirl! Is that your real hair? It's lovely. You look fantastic! We're hungry! We're hungry! What sort of cheese is this? You didn't have any Parmesan. It's Emmental. I've taken too much cheese. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, dear Alex Arthur! Thanks. Are we eating this cake or what? No! The presents first. Presents or cake? Presents, presents! Start with this one. This one first. - Can I tear it? - Yeah. Next! You don't have one. Yeah, it suits him! Check this out, guys. What is it? What? Your shelves are so dusty. Yeah, that's true. Thanks, mate. - Well... - There's one more. Leaving the best till last. - What is it? - It's a Mul-Mul. - Thanks. - You didn't have one? I've got one, but it's gone a bit bald. I needed a Romeo for my Juliet. That's killed off our presents! Look. I'll put him next to his Juliet. Your bedroom is no different. Like at your mum's house. Yes, I've kept the same bed. My feet stick out the bottom. I'd forgotten what a huge collection you have. It's been ten years. It's pretty much complete by now. You're 18 today. You think it's weird to have all this stuff at my age? No, but you're no longer a child. And neither am I. Alex... You took your time to catch on! Yeah, well... better late than never. Come on, move yourselves. We've got three films to watch. An Arthur night! You're squashing me! Doug, have you done all your sound checks? Yes, everything's fine. Go on, then, start it! ...in the very heart of Africa, that this story begins. No, this isn't Africa, it's Connecticut, where I was living before I mysteriously disappeared. But that's another story, which my grandson... Have you seen it before? First time! ...who goes by the name... Arthur! Thank you. Thanks. So? What's tomorrow's surprise? If we tell you, it won't be a surprise. - Do I dress warmly or not? - Shall we tell him? Do we tell him or not? Go on, tell him. Well, we've found Arthur's house. - What? - The house where it was shot. No, it was a set. It was taken down... It's still there, intact. It'll be a mess after 15 years... But it's there, don't spoil it. - Right. - Are you sure? Momo was there two days ago. No, but Momo's always been full of shit. Momo's full of shit? - Here. - Is this bullshit? Hey, guys! Me and Pilou have found Arthur's house! Are they stoned or what? There's something wrong with those guys. I dunno. - Where is it? - Don't worry. We'll take care of everything. We leave at 8 a.m. On that subject, if I could just interject this. I'd prefer 7:40 or even 7:30. There's 50% less traffic. Who doesn't give a toss? Sorry. It's so nice, all this green. I'm really happy! We'll soon be there. Ten K to go. That's nothing. I'm really getting impatient! There should be a calvary on the left. You're such a pain! We prefer the satnav's voice. No, I'm not keen on 4G, or even 5G now, in the car. She sounds like my mum. When I mentioned a calvary, do you all know what that is? Yeah. A calvary is... ls...? Some pains au chocolat, yeah? Doug! What? What, Jean? Get some pains aux raisins and croissants, please. - Anything else? - Yeah, an orange juice, please. Thanks. We'll soon be there. Makes a change from Paris. - I like this little village. - Yeah, it's sweet. - That was quick. - Thanks. These are yours. Great! - For you. - Thanks. Haven't we been by here? We've been going round for an hour. There's no one to ask. Let's ask over there. What are they doing? They're slowing down. - Why have we stopped? - To ask someone. Momo's directions are hopeless. Look at those horns. They're antlers. Pretty grim. Is there anyone here? It looks abandoned. Is anyone there? Yeah, there's smoke. Someone must be there. Let's try somewhere else. No, the law says you have to help people in danger. We're not exactly in danger. What are you up to? We're looking for a house where they made a film. The house of Arthur and the Minimoys. Do you know it? Arthur? There's no house here. It all burnt down, it's all gone, nothing left. It's dangerous here. What exactly is dangerous? Apart from him, you mean? Accidents happen here. Accidents. Stray bullets. Hunting accidents. Scram! Shit, guys! - Scram! - In the cars! Get outta here now! He was mental! That was like The Shining. Scram! Get outta here! Get in the cars! He was a lunatic. A lunatic! Yeah, that shotgun freaked me out. - Shall we call the cops? - He'll have a nephew in the force. - It's really weird. - They're all interbred out here. I'm sure I saw some feet. Feet? Yes. There was a washing line, African necklaces, boar heads and... feet. - Like human feet? - Yes, human feet, hanging there! Walking tall, eh? It's not funny! I'm pretty sure of what I saw. Do you have a photo? I was going to zoom, but the dogs came out and I fell. You mean the lions? - Are you mugging me off? - No. I tell you I saw feet and you mug me off! Shit! - I think I've found it. - No. I swear! It's exactly the same shape as Arthur's. Show me. Yeah, with the garage and the pond, it could be. - I think that's it. - Yes, we'll soon be there! We're leaving France... suspense... for Connecticut! We head deeper into the dense forest. Yes, it's in this sort of forest that the Bogo live. Yeah. - Turn right here. - Yeah, but it's unpaved. That's normal, it's nature. Yeah, I know that. It doesn't scare me. Here we go. No, we can't get past that. Damn! Perfect! Perfect! - This wasn't on the maps. - What a surprise! Is it much further? About 800 metres. We can walk, it'll do us good. Everyone carries their own stuff. Excuse me. This is easier. - Is your bag heavy? - It'll be lighter going back. - Good thinking. - Keep moving, Max. Thanks for your concern! - Are you serious, Dom? - Look at my load! Go on, you're fine. - Renata, ready? - No, no, no. What sort of a throw is that? Wait. All your markers! - We could be seriously lost. - No. I thought it was filmed in Kentucky, but the house was here all the time. It's Doug's fault if we get lost. - Douglas. - Yeah? I'm hungry. I've got stuff, but not right now. - The ice-box isn't too heavy? - Careful! No, it's easy with Jean. Watch out! Everything's easier with Jean. You only left a marker ten metres ago. - Just to be sure. - We'll be sure all right! Do you trust their compass? Yeah, you're right. - I've lost my thingy! - There! All right? Sunshine. It could be Africa, eh? No idea, I'm from just outside Paris. It's like the fields around Arthur's house. It should be over there. Let's go. Maxime, here. You okay? - The cicadas are louder. - Crickets. - What? - The cicadas are louder. If you like it, we like it. Barbed wire. There! What's he doing? Doug! Sorry. The ice-box. Did it all by myself! Oh, shit! Look at the cherry trees! Why is there blossom? It's not the season. Wait. - The blossom is plastic. - Come off it! - No, he's right. - We don't care, this is great! It's like entering the film, it's mental! Here we go. There's the garage, Dom! Come and see, the garage! - Come on! - A photo. It's all exactly the same, it's all here! This is crazy! - Quick, quick! - All of you, stand there. On your 18th you become a Minimoy! Five seconds! On three? One, two... Arthur! Look, it's perfect! Magnificent! Happy birthday, Alex! Look here. What's that? A hive. What do you think? Don't tell Mathilde, she'll run a mile. Us too! Here we go! Dom, come here. What's in there? That's Maltazard's cupboard. The curse! With the cake. - Is that in the second? - Here too, look. Look, like the Bogo. - You're not afraid? - No. - Shall I open it? - Yeah. What? I don't like that! Let's go upstairs. Honestly! - After you. - Thanks. What's this? - What's that? - I dunno. - There's a hatch. - What? Does our specialist remember that? - I don't remember a cellar in the film. - Nor me. It must be part of the set. Why would they build it and then not film it? Doesn't make sense. Maybe they built the set around an existing house. Clever girl! - Married within the year? - Very funny! - After you. - Thanks. There are even the train tracks. This is mental! There's even the telescope. - The one from the film? - Yeah. You think some tourist left it? Jean. There's a mug with hot coffee here. Must be Momo's or his mate's. Look, they can't be far away. Look, there's even the paint Arthur used for his initiation. Amazing! Careful! Guys! Accessories from the film. - I've already got that one. - Of course. Bogo stuff. - I don't believe it! - What? A Mul-Mul cage, how cool! With two in it. - Classy! - An axe, watch out! Put that down, it's dangerous. It's not even in the film. I can put this in the living room, with a light on it. It'll be cool. I'll take it back to Paris. It's a dummy. It still scared me! Yeah, it's pretty freaky. - Shall we keep going? - No, we came here for fresh air. It's making me claustrophobic. - Are you serious? - Come on, let's go. - Spoilsports! - See you later. - It is gloomy, though. - Yeah. Shall we keep going? I'm not so sure. Don't worry. You hear that? It sounds like running water. Can you see something? No, that's just it. The key's in the keyhole. That means it's locked from the inside. Can we go, please? I'll give it a try, anyway. Alex, please! Let's go. Yeah, sorry. You should've said you were scared. Well, a bit. You bloody idiot! I'm just having a laugh. Upstairs there's the paint Arthur used for his initiation. Yeah, but you've messed it up. Here they come. Hey, guys. You should have seen how scared they were. Well, did they jump or what? Yeah, he scared us. Out of their skins. Upstairs we found hot coffee and some gear. Jean thinks it's Momo. Momo? Yeah, it's possible. But we've made all this noise and they haven't showed themselves? We haven't been that noisy. I dunno. We could go around the house calling him. Maybe. - What? - That means "yes, boss". Momo! Pilou! Pilou! Where are you? I don't think they're here. We've been looking for 15 minutes. You've seen nothing either? We're not going to camp here. Shall we look around? Well? Well, here? Need a hand, girls? No, no, hands off! It's not time yet. Doug, I'm starving. There's stuff in that bag, but you're not having any of this yet. You should have been in the army. It's a question of discipline. In a hostile environment that's important. Hostile? We're not in the jungle. What was that? A hippopotamus. Thank you, Ice-Man Douglas! I'm too hot. - To Alex! - Who has the best mates on earth. - Cheers! - Happy birthday! To you! Thanks, guys. I got some great photos. I can make a birthday album. Wasn't there an exhibition? No. Well, little things, but nothing really big. - Is it ready yet? - Five minutes. - That painting was good. - See! But you have to stick to special shapes... "Specific" shapes. No, it's "specialâ. - Really? - Absolutely. Jean had his own artistic ideas. - I didn't say he couldn't. - His own ideas. No, it was really good. What is it? You scared me! - I was pissing here and it lit up. - It's a phone. - Do you recognise it? - No. Is it theirs? Let's ask them. Weird! Guys. Anyone lost a phone? - No. - No, I've got mine. It's knackered anyway. With an ugly death's head case. That's Momo's. Then he has me to thank. It was lost for good in the high grass. Try to unlock it. It needs a code. Try zeroes. So that's your code, Renata! It's not working. It's knackered. Is it really Momo's? Momo's never taken good care of his stuff. A good thing we found it. - I found it, pissing on it! - Pissing on it? Yeah, it was on the ground. Disaster! A strange find. Ladies and gentlemen, let's eat! - All right? - Yeah. - Well, guys? - We're tired. - Time to break it up? - Bedtime? - Sleep tight. - You too, Jean. Don't dream about me too much. Goodnight, guys. Goodnight. - Douglas, leave room for me. - See if you can get in. Would you rather be on the left or the right? I'll start on the left and we'll change at half-time. What, you really want to...? That was a joke. Come here. What's wrong? You're all tense. - I'm not tense. - You are, a bit. It's not the first time we've slept together. We started ten years ago. It's just that... I know you off by heart. And at the same time I feel I'm just getting to know you. - Do you understand? - Yes. But... that's good. We're like an old couple starting again. Yeah, that's true. Are you scared? I'm not scared. Well... yes, I'm scared of ruining something. I'm strong. In any case, even if it doesn't work out, we'll still be friends. And... if it does work out? That's... for me to judge. - A nice spot for me here! - No, but... It's an inflatable mattress, so don't sit right on the edge... If you'd have had a bigger tent... "If you had..." Hey, the old couple, stop bickering! Momo? Momo? Pilou? Are you okay? - Yeah, it's... - What? I had nightmares all night. Nice! No, nothing to do with you. It was a mixture of Arthur... Momo and Pilou. It was horrible. But you weren't in it. Nice of you to have spared me. This is the first time reality's better than my dreams. Did you sleep well? - It's not catching. - Hang on. I've only just started. - Where's the ice-box? - By the tap. If it was, I wouldn't have asked. - I'm coming. - Shit! Guys, come on! - It's not us. - Help me! - What? - It's not us. Get up and help me look, please. Doug. What? - I was hungry. - What the hell? Who did this? What, there's nothing to eat? - No, nothing. - Shit! What was it, a bear? There are no bears around here. - Right, Alex? - What? - No bears? - No, no bears. - Maybe coypus or raccoons. - Or foxes. Foxes with big feet. Look at the prints. They're probably ours. Last night I saw torches in the forest... At what time? Maybe about three or... Was the ice-box like that? - I didn't look. - You should have! - If you'd have taken... - "If you'd..." If you'd taken it into the tent... Oh, yeah! And if a bear came... There are no bears! "If"! The conditional! Learn some grammar! - All right, Doug. - Calm down a bit. Anyway, it's your job. - What? - To go and do some shopping. - On my own? - Yeah. On my own? I'm asking everyone else. - Yes, Douglas. - While we tidy up. - What do I get? - Croissants and pains au chocolat. You'll get nothing! - Some butter and jam... - Nutella. Sandwiches for later. And juice. - You're welcome! - Thanks. What about this? - Where are you going? - To get washed. Is there a river? Yeah, look at the dip. Then it rises again. There must be water. - Yeah, grey matter! - Move! Call us if you find something cool. - Will do! - See you later! Sam. Where's my breakfast in bed? It's on its way. Come back! Come on! Wait for me! This is lovely! But there's no water. There will be. Keep going down. This way. Come on. To the left. Wait for me. Are you scared? I can't wait to get wet. Did you sleep well? Yeah, not much. I wanted to say thanks. - What for? - Your patience. I feel stupid, I didn't notice. You were in your own world. Your childhood world where everyone is two millimetres tall. I understand, it's a wonderful world, where you feel safe. It's not easy to find a good reason to leave it. It's beautiful here. I prefer this. This is great. Hang on! How can there be fish here? Okay, I've stopped! Peace, peace! Peace? Yeah? Okay, peace, you win! - You got me in the eye. - Hang on, I'll dry it. It's only water. Hey, guys! Come here! Alex, come here, quick! It's mental! Is that Arthur's gnome, which marks where the passage is? - It's the real one! - And the hole, like in the film? I don't know, let's check. That's amazing! That's crazy. It's deep too. Is it just a film set? I think so, yes. Hang on, let's see. That's deep! I'll fetch my gear. You'll see! I can hear running water. But a long way away. Yeah, it's really deep. Stop it! I got some in my mouth! I hate you! Stop! That's weird. Did you cut yourself? You're cut. No, I don't think so. Why? - You had blood on your shoulder. - Where? It's all gone now. No, there too! What have you done? I don't know. Shit, Maxime! Shit! What the hell's going on? - Is he dead? - I don't know. - Is he dead? - I don't know, I said! It's Momo! You're right, it's Momo. We'll get you down, Momo. - What do we do? - Untie the rope on the tree. - Momo, I'll get you down! - Hurry! Don't worry, I've got it. Maxime! Maxime, wait! I'll get a lever. I can't. Shit! Help me! - Shit, it hurts! - We'll get it open. - Be careful! - Grab the stick. - Pull. - On three. One, two... - Help me! - We did it. Help me! This shirt. It's over now. Sorry. Let's go. When you said you had your gear, you meant it. Yes, I told you. I don't talk rubbish. We'll start with this. Oh, right! Okay, I get it. I have this for you. - Is this the fluorescent thing? - Yeah. Drop it in. - Got it? - I just drop it in? Yeah, go ahead. - It's gone to China! - It's crazy! It's a Swiss cheese down there? The sea was here millions of years ago. Shall we do it? Defo! I'm with you. Alex, you can't get in that hole. No, not me. But maybe Jean's camera. Hang on. I'm sorry. Maxime, hang on! I'm so sorry, I swear. Shit! - Get the others. - What? It's not that heavy! It's not that heavy but it cost me a month's salary. - Can I help? - No, I've got it. There! It's going down quickly. - Scary. - That's nothing yet. The lower it goes... the scarier it gets. I didn't think it'd be so deep. Can you see anything? It's still going down. Already 20 metres, that's insane! What's that? Jean! Alex! Undo it! Go on! Shit! That's it. Careful! Hold on, Max. Take deep breaths. What's going on? I don't know, I don't understand. People down there were trying to kill us! No, calm down! Calm down, okay? There aren't people living underground. There's a logical reason, something... mechanical. I don't want to stay, it's too freaky. I agree. That guy said it was dangerous. Alex, we're not staying. - Okay, when the boys get back. - She's right. Sorry, but she's right. Shit! That's it, Max, just hang on! If you stay here, so do. Jean. Shit! Jean! His leg? - Max... - Get the kit! It'll be okay. What happened? He trod in a bear trap. I don't want to scare the others, but we found Momo, hanging upside-down. - Then he fell. - What? Take deep breaths. - They've got it. - Find the scissors. Give them here. I can't! There are psychos in this forest! We have to get out of here! We'll get Max to hospital. Let's go. Come on. We'll get branches and blankets, and make a stretcher. - We'll get him to the car. - Breathe. - I don't have the keys. - In mine! - Someone has to stay here. - Yeah. Hold on in there, Max! Jean, let's go! Dom, take my place. Breathe. Max, this is going to sting. It'll be okay. Here, take this. That was enough for a horse. - Let's go. - Yes, let's go! Everybody ready? On three. Two, three! Be brave. Okay, girls. We stay calm and stick close to the house, okay? That way. Hurry up, guys! Hang on. Where have the markers gone? Renata left loads! Wait! It's okay. We go towards those pines. - Are you sure? - Yes, trust me! Okay! - Are you okay? - Yeah, and you? Girls! Remember the scene with the mum and Darkos? Yeah, the swing? Come here. Be careful, it might not be safe. No, it's fine. Come on. Come on, then. Three will be too heavy. No. She's only 30 kilos soaking wet! Come on! - Don't worry, Max. - Shit! - What's going on? - I'm glad I didn't park there! Come on. Be careful! Gently does it. It's okay, Maxime, we're there. Put him down gently. Shit! Has Doug come back or didn't he even go? It's cold, he didn't even go. You think we passed him? Or he got lost without the markers. Douglas! Hang on. No signal. Doug won't go far without GPS. Hospital first, Douglas after! Doug has the keys! Shit! Jean, do you know how to hot-wire it, like they do in films? I'm black so I know how to steal cars? - You twat! - Guys! - What matters is that Doug is lost. - And Maxime? Maxime? We'll make him comfortable. Out of the way! Come on. We'll put him in the back. - Give us a hand. - Wait. There, Max. - Take my place! - Got him. - There. - Sorry, Max. Get in the car. Sit up. Look, you stay with him. Hoot the horn three times every minute. - And if there's trouble? - Five times, okay? In you get. Let's go. Come on! Doug! Doug! Douglas! You've got to listen to this. Here. She's a young girl, but what a voice. It's insane! She's twelve, with a voice like Amy Winehouse. Amazing! Totally. Renata! Help! Doug! Douglas! - A killer, eh? - Yeah, cool. Another? - Go on. - The same girl. Douglas! Shit, you scared me! Can't you answer when we're calling? Alex, he's here. And he told us tree-hugging was ridiculous. Doug! Do you think we're stupid? Alex. - What's going on? - I don't know. We can't stay here. - Are you listening to me? - I don't know. We can't stay here! Alex. That's Dom. Let's go. Let's go for the girls. Come on. How long have they been gone? They won't be long now. Here... Get out of there! Get out of there! Sam! Get away! - Sam! Renata! - Alex, what? - Sam! - Sam, can you hear me? Sam, answer, please! Alex, please tell me she's not dead! Sam! Wait... I think I see her. Sam? It's okay. I can see her. - Give me the rope. - Here. Sam, try to grab the rope. You can do it. - Wait... - Tie it around your waist. Help us, Sam, tie it around your waist. Wait... Around your waist. Come on! - Done it. - Done it? Okay. - Slowly! - Let me! Pull! Pull, guys! Come on! - Sam, we've got you! - Faster! Sam? Wait! Wait... Water. Listen to the water. - The river is in the cellar! - Let's go! I'll wait for you here. In case the others come back. Shit! Come on, let's go. Jean? It's okay. Come on. - Are you going in? - Yes. Hold this. Stay here. - Any problem, call right away. - Yeah. Jean! Talk to me, Jean! Jean! He's gone into a... tube. A tube? What sort of tube? What are you on about? A tube... I can't explain more than that. It's a tube! Alex? It's okay, don't worry. It's okay. It's Pilou! What? What about Pilou? He's dead. Jean! Jean, can you see him? I can hear him, yes. Sam? It's okay, I've got Sam! She's here! Thank you, God. Are you okay? I'm here. Come on, let's go, up you get. Jean! Jean, what's going on? He's found Sam. Come on, let's go. Alex, there's weird shit down here! Hurry up! Come on. It's okay, I've got Sam. Come on. Alex, hurry up! It'll be okay. Be careful. Up you go. Thank you. I'm here. Nature feeds you. You will feed nature. What's that? Sam. You have to untie me. What's going on? Want to go back to the Minimoys' world? Now is the time. The moon is full. No, it isn't full. Never mind. We're going to take care of you. Bogo! Don't move! Don't move! Okay, I'm not moving. My gun's in my bag. I'm going to get it. Renata, you create a diversion. Sam... you go for help, okay? - No, I won't leave you. - He's right, we need help. Please get help. - I won't leave you. - Go! Hold him tight. Don't worry, everything will be fine. Ready, pull! Let me go! Pull! Pull! Pull! - We go on three. - Yes. One... Let me go! Two... Three! Let me go! Leave him alone! Alex! Let him go! Please! Let him go! Run! Get back! Help! No, no, no! I told you not to come here. This land is sacred! Okay? We won't come again. - Never come again. - We won't. Never again! Never! Okay. It's over. Over. Okay! We have an infirmary where you can rest. We'll question you later. Our mates in the forest? We've found their bodies. They'll be sent home. We found another friend in the barn, covered in bee stings. Who was it who attacked us? A gang of youngsters from the city. They have role-playing games. Three years ago it was Batman versus Superman, jumping off buildings, thinking they could fly. This year it was the film Arthur and the Minimoys. They found this house and went mad. Doing drugs, meeting at the weekend, and fighting to the death. It proves that a film can do real harm. We're ready to go. Thanks. We can go now. Do you need a hand or can you walk? - We can walk. - Okay. Please. Yes, sorry. Subtitles: Howard Bonsor. Subtitling: HIVENTY
