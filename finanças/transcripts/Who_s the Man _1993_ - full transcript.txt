Where you going?! Now, look, Lionel. I hired you to acquire certain properties in Harlem. I must say I'm very chagrined... that your friend Nick... who owns a very important part of that Godforsaken block... has refused to sell to me. I can't make any moves until I acquire his property. I've done everything I possibly-- No, you haven't! You must take care of this. We had a deal. And if you renege on it... I'll give your markers back as a gift... to the guys that you owe that money to. Now, that would be very unfortunate. Joey, what happened here? Building burnt down this afternoon... and of course the fire department was late... just like they was last week up the block. Ain't nobody looking out for us out here, man. Damn! Nick, where we gonna live? Where we gonna go, man? What's the landlord doing about this? That Demetrius ain't nothin'. That motherfucker don't give a Goddamn... about what happens to none of us around here. He owns this building? He owns most of the neighborhood. These people gonna stay in the church tonight. I'll--I'll let you in. Come on. Bring your children with me. We're going with Nick, man. Come on, let's go with Nick. Fuck Demetrius. Let's get out of here, man. Later for this fire department. Look at Jed Clampett. The man shoots at a possum... and strikes oil. How come that shit don't happen to us? This ain't Hollywood, man. This is Homeywood. I want to be Jed Clampett. What for? He's got a phat house in Beverly Hills! With his granny. He's got more money than Bill Cosby. You ever see Jed Clampett with a woman? He's got a swimming pool. You can't swim. Elly May is fly. You right. Elly May is fly. But they're related, and if you Jed Clampett... you got that fool Jethro living with you. Man, l'd kick his monkey ass out. But you can't do none of that... 'cause you here with me, Dré. And you ain't never gonna get rich... and you ain't moving to Beverly Hills. Is anything ever gonna happen to us? Someday, my brother. That's it? Life ain't no TV show, Dré. Look at that fool Jethro, man! I hate that motherfucker! Throw his ass out, Jed! Get him out! We are not going to the police academy... are we? Ain't no way that's gonna happen, man. No way, no how. You are police officers now! Being a police officer is about one thing! Who knows what that is?! Harassing black people. It's about order! We are the people who have to maintain order! Order in our own lives, and order on the job! That means you can't go into a fried chicken joint... and eat the Goddamn party plate anymore! Is that clear?! - Why not? - What?! He said why not? And if my man likes fried chicken, he can-- I don't like your attitude, boy! Boy is a white racist word. Shut the fuck up, pig! I know how you got in here... and I'm gonna be watching you! Did you see him wrinkle my shirt, man? Yeah, he fucked up your shirt. Did you see him wrinkle my shirt, man? What's wrong with old Mr. Clean? Black Kojak trying to be better than Baretta. Freeze! Oh! Every once in a while, there are civilian losses. Try to avoid it. Next! Ready... What the hell?! Get out of here! Next! Ready... Ooh! Get--get out of here! You are gonna last about 2 minutes on the street! Next! No, no, no, y'all! You're gonna blow your johnsons off. Do it police style! That's uptown style. Gimme some. Get back in line! Ow! Captain... they screwed up every drill, every exercise... and they have no respect for police regulations. You know, when I was in Vietnam with Nick... he was just like you 2. He had no time for regulations... but he was a helluva lot smarter than you 2 clowns... and he could get away with it. You were in 'Nam with Nick? You don't think you got in here... by the merit system, do you? Now get your act together and do what Griles says. Now get the hell out of here. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Take it easy on them, Sergeant. They're all right. Yes, sir. Amen! Amen! Amen! I know God heard us today! - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. One of our community leaders... has asked to speak to you today. Is it all right? Yes! Is it all right? Let's have an amen for our brother... Deacon Nick Crawford. Amen! Thank you very much. Thank you, brother. We in the Harlem community... are faced with the threat of creeping gentrification. Oh, that's a fancy word. It means that people move to your block... and make it nice. They make it so nice... you can't afford to live there... unless you a judge, or something like that. Now, we have got to let the people behind this... know what time it is. We have got to gain control of our neighborhood. We need to support our own businesses. We need to own our own homes. We need to take Harlem back! Now, I'm gonna lead a demonstration... to stop these condos... and I want to see all y'all there! Give us back our neighborhood! Don't go on, the strip is good... Give us back our neighborhood! Don't go on, the strip is good... To protest the gentrification of Harlem... by outside developers. Our own Ralph McDaniels was on-site... to interview the organizer of the march Nick Crawford. Do you really think you'll be able... to stop Demetrius? The man has got to be stopped. He's turning people from their homes. The people in Harlem have got to stop... the colonization of their neighborhood. We have to give ownership back to these people. You can't keep 'em down on the plantation. They got to rise up. He says he's building condos. I don't see no building going on. Oh, no, Dré! Look, man! Nick's on TV! The big problem in Harlem is Demetrius. Crawford is a local merchant... who has owned a barber shop... You call us, boss? I need to talk to you about a problem I'm having. I'm telling you, Redd Foxx is alive. Man, you crazy! Redd Foxx ain't alive! No, he's not dead. He faked his own death... so the I.R.S. wouldn't come looking for him. Oh, God. Him and Sammy Davis... are hiding out together out in Las Vegas. Redd Foxx dead! Yo, man. I want my initials on the side of my head. Oh, no. See, where you been, son? That was last year. Why don't you let me style you, baby? Make you look like Peabo. - Oh, shit! - What the hell? What up? Wait. Wait. Hold up, guys. Now--now this is fucked up! Oh, lookee here. Lookee here. My boys are cops. Well, all right. Wait. Hold up, man. You mean to tell me... they gave y'all guns? Say, who in the fuck... believe you 2 niggers cops, man? Look at you--looking like before and after. I swear to God. I wish you would try to arrest me. You'd be wearing 3 shoes. 2 on your feet, and one in your ass. Back off, man. I know y'all brothers ain't doing no real work. I bet y'all writin' parking tickets. Y'all need to represent... comin' here with that bullshit, man! Hold it! We're here to fight the forces of evil... to make the streets safe... for you people to walk on. So don't fuck with us. Y'all are police! It's wonderful! Come on. Come on. Come on, man! What? I love a man in uniform. You're looking mighty fly... in that uniform, Officer Dré. Looking mighty fly yourself, Officer Lover. Man, this is a trip, Dré. I never thought we could be cops. You know we're going to have to do... a lot of explaining in the street. Yo! Isn't that Jawaan's jeep? Yeah, that's his jeep, man. I'm going to pull him over... so I can get my $10 he owes me. I don't understand, man. What's going on, man? I'm just here chillin' like. You see us with our people... me and my mens-like. What's going on? Why's we being prohibited? Jawaan. Oh, shit! Ed Lover. You the man? That's right, Jawaan. I'm the man. Who's the man? Ed Lover's the man? Damn! Yo, Jawaan! Doctor Dré?! You the man, too? Oh, that shit is fucked up, kid! Fucked up! OK, OK. Listen up. Listen up. Quiet! Put the magazines away, now! You guys are not selling enough... of these raffle tickets, OK? Somebody's gonna win this trip to the Poconos. Get on the stick with this, all right? OK. Number one: - Barnes. - Here. I want you to go up to 153rd Street. Keep the gang members away from the old ladies... all right? Got it. - Day! - Here. I want you to go up to St. Peter's. Get the crackheads out of the bake sale, all right? And get that hair out of your face. Thank you. All right. Uh... Uh... Louver? Lever? Lover, Sergeant. Lover. And, uh... Dree? Dru? Dra? That's Dré, Sergeant. Dré... Doctor...Dré. Yes, sir. Everybody else dismissed. Dree, Larva, up here, now. Lover. Yes, sir? Have a doughnut. Thank you, Sarge. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Doc. Doctor...Dré. Let me ask you something. You got a stethoscope? No. Do you, uh-- do you work in a hospital? - No. - Do you have any patients? No, no, no. Did your mother give that name by birth? No. You just decided to become a doctor? Yeah. OK. Uh... Can I borrow your billy club, please? Thank you. Ahem. Ahem! Mother-- Thank you. You know, my, uh, brother... went to school for 8 years and took out $350,000... in federally financed student loans... that he's paying back at an interest rate of 18%. So he should be done paying that about... I don't know--when he's about 75 years old... just so he can call himself Dr. Cooper! Excuse me, Sarge... mind if I have a doughnut? No... you may not have a doughnut, OK? You will never have a doughnut again, ever. You will never have another doughnut, OK? Lover can have as many doughnuts as he wants. He can have a dozen doughnuts. He can have 2 dozen doughnuts. He can strap a fag bag full of doughnuts... around his waist when he goes to work. He can have a giant doughnut on the top of the squad car, OK? But you will never have another doughnut. You can't even say the word ''doughnut.'' Do you understand? The word ''doughnut''... is no longer in your vocabulary, OK? If you meet a guy named Don... you call him by his last name from now on. That's the way it works. No bagels. No life savers. Nothing round with a hole in it! Nothing! Now...here's the situation. You guys are the good guys... and you chase and arrest the bad guys. What a surprise, huh? It's a good system. It works. And here's your assignment: all of Harlem, OK? From Lennox Ave. to the river. And I want all crime and all drugs... stamped out by 6:00 tonight, OK? You got that, Doc? Dismissed... Larva. Larva? What kind of doughnuts they got over there, man? Oh, a whole lot. A wide assortment. Jelly? Jelly, eclair, crullers. Think I can get some? The long ones with the cream. Those, too. Jesus. This is a piece of junk. I can't believe they give us... this big hunk of scrapola, man. At least we got a car. What you complaining about? I think the sergeant dissed you, man. I don't know. I think the sergeant kind of likes me. No, I'm telling you. He dissed you. Come on. Let's go see Bubba. Yo, man. Remember that old TV show ''Mod Squad?'' That was some dope shit, man. Oh, hell, yeah. Clarence Williams III was Mack Daddy! You know, that big Afro-wearin' brother-- you know he was goin' with Peggy Lipton, right? The white girl? The same white girl that got married to Quincy Jones. She's into that black culture shit... or some shit like that. You know what I'm saying? Get up against the wall! Oh, man! Man, why the cops always hassling us?

Pull the stake and bring it in the corner. Excuse me. The far corner. Excuse me. What are you guys doing? Just taking soil samples. Soil samples? What for? Standard procedure, Officer. We check the soil before we start construction. So it's OK if we borrow one of your soil samples? Uh, I don't think that's possible. Why not? There's enough dirt around here for everybody. This is private property. Well, how about if we just borrow... some of your private property? I don't think Mr. Demetrius... would like that very much. You tell Mr. Demetrius to kiss my ass. Come on. We got to go talk to Nick. Come on. Let's go. Private property. Soil sample.

I talked with Nick's lawyer this morning. You guys have been named in the will. He left you the barber shop. - The barber shop? - Damn. And I know some people that'll pay you... a lot of money for that property. See, I don't care about money right now, man. I just want to find out who killed Nick. Maybe it was the same people... that's been setting these fires. You have any other ideas, Lionel? He had a nasty exchange... with that crack dealer Chauncey. Thanks, Lionel. - Thanks Lionel. - See you later. Come on, Dré. Damn! Chauncey! - Bubba. - Yo, B. How's the ride? It freaks. Let's get him. Whoever burned this barber shop down... knew exactly what they were doing. It's going to cost a fortune... to put this place back on its feet, man. Yeah. Money we ain't got right now, partner. Money we ain't never gonna have. Shit. Hey, yo, Dré, check this out, man. What you got there, man? This look familiar to you? Nick never owned a gun like this. This ain't Nick's gun. Let's bring it to Fuji. Fuji! Can you do a test on this thing? Test on what? - Test on gun. - Gun kill Nick? - Do a test. - On the gun. - When you want? - Today is good. - Today? - On the gun. On the gun? No need. Gun German. Cannot be traced. An untraceable German gun? - Later, Fuj. - Later, Fuj. - Hai. - Hai. Hai. Eh, Doctor Dré, Ed Lover... what a pain in the ass. Say, brother... say, brother... you need to get off that stuff, man. That's stunting your growth. Damn, Dré, if you're the man... I've definitely been on the crack pipe too--whoa!

I know something about it. I know homeboy got smoked... but I ain't got shit to do with it. I ain't got no beef with him, man. Yo, man! What's up, huh? Mmm-mmm. Oh, shit! Who's going to pay for my fucking booze, pig? Mind yours! Where'd you get the piece from, Chauncey?! My name is Nighttrain, fool! Yo, man! Where'd you get the gun from, man!

What you lookin' at? Anybody want to go for a swim? Y'all folks have a nice day. Let's go, Dré. Later, Chauncey. Nighttrain. Nighttrain, man! Nighttrain! You... don't even try. It don't look like Lorenzo lives there. I think Chauncey played us like a B-side, man. I told you he was frontin'. You didn't say nothing, Dré. Ed, look, man, you don't listen to nobody, man. All you do is lie about all the women that you ain't got. Please, man, OK? Central, this is car 2899. l need an address on a Chauncey Jackson... A.K.A.: Nighttrain. Over. Yeah, I think this is Chauncey's house. Gotta be, man. It's gotta be. Knock on the door. Open the door, Chauncey. It's Ed and Dré. Knock again. Chauncey, we going to count to 3... then I'm going to kick in the door... then we're going to kick in your ass. One... Ready? Yaaahhhhh! Damn, Dré. Somebody talked to that motherfucker already. Could have cut himself shaving. Shit. He's dead as a motherfucker, man. What were you 2 guys doing here? We thought he knew something about the Nick Crawford murder. So you were functioning as detectives? No, not really. Look, we each got our own... responsibilities on the force, fellas. Who's your sergeant? Sergeant Cooper. Look, guys, you let the real detectives... handle this, all right? Y'all guys just get out of here. Beat it! Big Laurel and Hardy look-alikes... wannabe detectives. Now what are we going to do? Get the results of the dirt... we took to the lab. You gave him the dirt, right? You were supposed to give him the dirt. No, no, no, man. You were supposed to give him the dirt. Trust me. Damn it, Dré! I never had the dirt, OK? Those guys look like Run D.M.C. Oh, that's good. Come on, baby. There. That's it. That's it. Fuji! Fuji, my man. Gun untraceable. Yeah, Fuji, we know. We want you to check out that soil sample... and let us know what's in it. Drugs in soil? - You tell us. - Tell you what? - Something in soil. - What in soil? You tell us. Need police geologist. Who's the geologist? I call Bernstein. - Go call Bernstein. - Hai. - Hai. - Hai. Good morning, men. Good morning, Captain. Sergeant Cooper tells me... that you two have been playing detective. Yes, sir. We're investigating-- Excuse me. You're patrolmen. And l want you to understand... in no uncertain terms... that you are not to investigate... Nick Crawford's murder or anyone else's. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Yeah. Somebody new is being put on the case today. I think he's a friend of yours. Come in, Detective. - Griles?! - Detective? Got promoted. Now Griles is going to head the case... and I don't want you 2 near it. Capisce? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Ok, good. Dismissed. Yo, Griles. Griles. Yo, Griles. Lorenzo Martin, man, this guy, man... he's selling this type of gun, man. Hey, look! I don't want your help... and I don't need your help. Now you 2 dickheads... are lucky you're even on the force! Now you stay away from me... and away from this case! Hey, look! This is no ''Police Academy'' bullshit... you can just clown your way through! Now you stay away from me... and away from this case! You got it?! Fuckin' dickheads! Why it be all that, man? Dickheads. We're doing the best we can. Isaac Hayes lookalike. All right, people, quiet down. Quiet down. Pipe down. They got George back. They got pitching. They got the whole-- Hertzog! What the fuck? Why is it every time I start a meeting... everybody else shuts up... you keep talking? Shut the fuck up. Yes, sir. Thank you. OK... the first order of business... Barnes and Day, 37 collars this week. Not bad. Well, look who came to join the party. Doctor Dree and his partner Mr. Lurver. What'd you guys get? You got 2 collars this week. Pretty sure they're the ones on your shirts. I'm sorry. My mistake. My mistake. Uh... I forgot the dead guy you apprehended... on your day off. Tell you what. Everybody dismissed... except for...guess who. Doctor Dré. Let's go. Sergeant Cooper? What is it, Lover? May I have a doughnut? You can have as many doughnuts as you want. Thanks, Sarge. Hi. Don't even think about it. I'm glad you dropped by. Little change in precinct policy. As of today, I will be known as President Cooper. I'm not going to get paid or anything. I'm not going to debate or go on the ''Larry King Live'' show. No--I'm just going to be President Cooper. As a matter of fact... Monday, Wednesday, Friday, I'll be President Cooper... and Tuesday and Thursday, I think I'll be... King Cooper! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! And you know why? Because I... feel like it! I just want to be a king, and now l've decided... I'm going to call myself king-- so I'm a king! I'm a king. King Cooper. That's me. King Cooper... we want to be assigned to... the Nick Crawford murder case. That's right. We got a-- We felt like-- But-- I got a better idea. Tony Como. - Tony ''Clams''? - Mm-hmm. - The wise guy? - That's right. He's supposed to be testifying... as a government witness in a case over in Brooklyn... but his gall bladder acted up, so now... there's apparently a hit out on him. We got a 24-hour surveillance thing going on... and you guys are going to go over... and relieve the 2 officers on duty... and take over for the next 24 hours, OK? But King Cooper, we just feel that-- See you later, King Cooper. By the way, uh, Lover. Yeah? How's that doughnut? Mmm. It's good. And there's a whole big box... of chocolate doughnuts sitting over on that table. Hey, Clams, where are the ashtrays around here? What do you think this is, a hotel? This is a hospital. I'm sick over here. Relax. Your gall bladder's... going to explode, for Christ's sake. Do me a favor. Get rid of that cigarette. There. You happy? Hey! That's my water, for Christ's sakes! What did you want me to do? Stick it up in your ass? You know, you're driving me fucking crazy. You're supposed to be over here taking care of me. Hey, I'm not your fucking nursemaid. Hi, Tony. We're your replacements. I'm Officer Dré. This is Officer Lover. We're here to protect you. What's this? Abbott and Costello? You mean Amos and Andy, don't you? Who sent these moulies in here? How the fuck do l know? I don't work here. We'll be right outside. Vito, do me a favor, huh? Get rid of these guys. Yo, Dré, man, what's a moulie? You're supposed to be taking care of me. I think it's an uncomplimentary... description of a brother. Who the fuck are you? Damn, man. This day is not going well at all. I'm out. I'll call. Where'd that third ace come from? I palmed it. Bad, man. That's bad. Hello? Dré, what's up? Bellevue? All right. Fellas, Frankie's outta here. I gotta go bail out my homies. Yo, why you always hang with those pigs, man? Steve, I told you, when I was the only white kid... growing up on 114th street... them 2 are the only ones that ever had my back. What the fuck are you talking about, man? You grew up on 120th street. That's not the point, Billy, really. It's about friendship-- men with other men, playing cards. Man, we got things to do. We can't stand around all day guarding this racist piece of shit. One more word from the pasta king here... I'm deflating all his tires. I can't stand it. Nuh-huh-huh. Fuckin' day, man. Fellas, sorry I'm late. It was that 2 train. The power went out. In the dark, somebody starting touching my balls! The lights come on, I look at this guy in a silk shirt-- Frankie, Frankie. We got Tony Como in the room. Tony Clams? I love that guy! Good, 'cause you're guarding him. Tell him you're a cop. We gotta go out for a while. It's about Nick. Cool? Cool, yeah. Can I borrow your hat to look legit? Thanks, Frankie. Gotta be realistic, fellas. Hi, how are ya? Detective O'Hearn. From the 2-3. Tony. Tony, how are ya? Who are you? Detective O'Hearn from the 2-3. Oh, good. A white cop. Hello, officers. Hi. Is Mr. Demetrius available? I'm sorry. He's in a conference. Well, tell him the police are here. This one is gonna be real popular. They'll be in the next issue of ''Vogue.'' Teesha? Ed, Dré, what are y'all doing here? You know each other? Yeah. From the same neighborhood. Well, what can l do to help you gentlemen? You seem pretty interested in Harlem, Mr. Demetrius. Well, it's a great neighborhood... and I believe it's coming back. Did you know a Nick Crawford? He was that unfortunate barber... who was killed by the drug dealers. I understand he was a model citizen. So this is a map of Harlem, huh? All these buildings on this block... are coded red. Except for one the barbershop is in. Why is that? Here, let me show you. All the red ones are the ones that I own. I'm developing those properties... into condominiums. Well, what's that drillin'... you doing uptown? My engineers are collecting geological samples. It's what one does when one builds. How come you ain't done no building in Harlem? All that drillin', no building. Don't make sense to me! Because it takes time to get the necessary information. One spends a lot of money to put up a building. If the preliminary steps aren't handled carefully... you can imagine the results. Would you care for some coffee or tea? You buying up all the property... around the barber shop. Nick is leading demonstrations... to try to stop you. Somebody tries to buy the property... but he won't sell. Bang! He's dead. Dré, you smell something? I smell bullshit. I knew it! I knew it smelled like bullshit in here! If you're implying... that I had anything to do with that murder... I can assure you... I do not do business like that. Now, if there's anything else l can do... to help you gentlemen... No. Thanks for your time. You know, I cannot believe you 2 just did that-- Save the drama for your mama. I ain't tryin' to hear. What's up with you and Demetrius? We are business partners. My uncle introduced us. Lionel? Yes, Lionel. He's backing my design company. And by the way, we're having our first fashion show... in a couple of days. I would appreciate it if y'all did not show up. Cool. But I'm telling you, he's dirty. What do you think he's doing? I don't know, but whatever it is, it ain't cool. I'm a pretty good judge of character... and if I thought the man was dirty, I wouldn't be doin' business with him. Frank. It's Ed. Everything cool? No. He's gettin' to be a royal pain in the balls... for one thing. Yo, Frankie, man. Yo, gimme 4 on 615. Sure. Can you get me some of those catheters? All right. Thanks. It's impossible. I can't! Hey, Detective. I can for a couple of hours. I didn't--no, I can. Yes. OK. 2 hours. Good-bye. You know what? Maybe Teesha was right, man. Why would Demetrius have Nick killed? I know she's fine, Dré... but don't let your johnson run your life, all right? Who else got a motive? What the-- Do you guys know what happened today at 4:36? Do you have any idea what happened today at 4:36? No, you don't. Let me tell ya. Tony Clams got shot. He got fuckin' shot! Only by the Grace of God is he still alive! You guys were supposed to watch him! You fucked me! You might as well kiss me, 'cause you're fucking me! Where were you guys? Where the-- Is that jelly... that I smell? Bavarian cream? Bagels? Gimme the club. You guys are on foot patrol... for the rest of your lives! Do you understand that? Foot patrol. Capital ''f,'' small ''o'', small ''o''... little tiny ''t.'' Did you ever see a little tiny ''t''? It's like a little curlicue-- little-- Tell me... that...you're...not... touching my fucking badge! He lost it. The sergeant lost it. Let's get outta here. Yeah. I went to that Michael Bolton concert last night. Oh! He's such an accomplished performer. I was really impressed. 014 to 183 Amsterdam right away. That's us. Let's hit it. Let's go. Whoa! Whoa! What is that? Stop it! I can't! Go, go, go, go! Yo, man, I don't understand. You guys fucked up! You oughta be cops... like Leon Spinks shoulda won a beauty contest... and that nigger ugly! Now, Leon's a good brother. Now, Biz Markie-- that's a ugly motherfucker! Bullshit. Yo, yo, I--I need a refill. Who's comin' back with me to the store? Oh, man! Why the fuck you keep drinkin' that shit, man? Your insides'll be fucked up like your ugly-ass face. I just-- Forty, you're so messed up all the time... you don't remember nothin' no way! That's fucked up-- Shut the fuck up, man. Sound like you have a dick in your mouth, man. You don't make no Goddamn sense. Hey, fair ladies. Hey. What up, light skin? Hey, I'm sorry about Tony Clams. Where the fuck were you? Yolanda showed up. What do you mean, Yolanda showed up? We oughta kick your ass, Frankie. You almost got us busted off the force! Hey, I did you guys a favor... and they tried to arrest me! It's unbelievable. I was in the smoking lounge 5 minutes. Some wise guy comes in and-- boo-yah--pops Tony Clams... and it's my fault? I don't wanna hear that shit, Frankie. You supposed to be my friend, man. And you supposed to be guardin' that racist piece of shit... and you doin' the wild thing with Yolanda. Lorenzo! Get that motherfucker! Come on! Hurry up, man! He knows who killed Nick! Come on! There he goes! Y'all go that way! Get that motherfucker! Don't move. You fucked up, Ed Lover... Tryin' to be the man. Fuck you, Lorenzo. Say good-bye, Mr. Man. So, Lorenzo, you're in the gun business? Naw, man, I'm retired, man. Where'd you get the gun? I don't remember. Think I should let Frankie refresh your fucking memory? Yo, what about my rights? You got the rights to get your ass thrown in the East River... if you don't start answerin' my questions! All right. All right. I don't know the guy. All I know is he's bringing them in from Germany. Can I go now? You ain't goin' nowhere! Does anybody have any cab fare? Yo, man, did you have to take a cab, man? Man, I got there, didn't I? After Frankie saved my ass, man. Me and you are supposed to be-- Look at Flavor, man! Yo, Dré, get me outta here, man. I can't do nothin' for you, man! Hey, Griles, what's up with the case, man? We're makin' progress. When you gonna go talk to Demetrius, man? What's he gotta do with it? He know what's goin' on. Oh, yeah? Tell me, Sherlock. What be goin' on? We don't know exactly-- Yeah, yeah. Great. I'll go arrest him. Beat it! Hey, Griles... I want you to keep your eye on those 2. Yes, sir. Oh, yes... uh, maybe once more... how's...it look? I have no idea what you're doing. Perfect! Fuji! Ed, Dré... this is Bernstein. - Hi, Bernstein. - Hey. Where'd you guys get this sample? Uptown. Guys were drilling. Have any idea what they might be lookin' for? - This is peat. - Who's Pete?! Peat's a substance. Found in bogs. - Found in swamps. - What else? We have leaves. Like from a tree? Yes. From trees. - That it? - No, not it. The layer above the peat, the leaves... is made up of sand. Sand from the beach? Precisely. Peat, leaves, sand? There's a geological profile the drillers look for... when they're trying to find oil. Oil. Like what Jed Clampett got? You trying to tell me there's oil in Harlem? Possibly. Demetrius is lookin' for oil! It's very unlikely. I mean, they never found oil around here before. That's why he smoked Nick. - Hai! - Hai! Hello. - Ed. - What's up, Dré? Man, what makes a beautiful girl like that... wanna go out with a short, slimy sauerkraut-suckin'... short and slimy motherfucker like that? I'm-a go ask. Hold it. Aren't we supposed to lay back a little bit? I'm gonna throw him off his game, man. Looks like we got company, y'all. Oh, man! It's Griles! Yo, Fab, you got any ideas, man? Plenty, baby. I got you covered like a rug on this one. Watch this. Come back, Daddy. Baby, I'll be back. Ooh, Daddy, you're home! You lookin' good tonight, girl. Mm. How you been? Everything's cool. Looky here, baby... you see that kid in that car back over there? Yeah, I see him. I want you to go over there... and I want you to rock his world. - You hear me? - Yes, Daddy. I want you to make him scream. Anything for you, Daddy. Yeah. Handle it, girl. You look pretty hungry back there, baby. Why don't you call me... when you're ready for dessert, big boy? Rrr! That's what I'm talkin' about! What's he got that I don't got? I'm-a go ask. Hold that. You got soda all on my jacket. I got half a burger and soda on my jacket. Why am I gonna do that? I'm suspending you 2 from the force... effective immediately. But, Captain, we got a suspect and a motive... in the Nick Crawford murder case. We think there might be... oil in the hood, Captain. Oil? That's why Demetrius is buying up all the property. You see, Nick Crawford was sitting... on the last piece of property on the block. And that's why Demetrius had him killed. So, wait a minute. What you're telling me... is that one of the most successful... real estate developers in this city... is digging for oil in Harlem? - Yeah! - Yeah! Listen to me. There is oil in Saudi Arabia... not Harlem. There is oil in Venezuela. There is no oil on 125th Street! Am I clear? But, Captain, if you-- You're lucky that Mr. Demetrius... is not pressing charges. Now, clean out your lockers and get out of here! Hey, Mel, I need some more tape. Sue, we gotta get those-- Is Teesha around? Uh, yeah, she's in the back. Thanks a lot. Hey, Mel, that tape! Ok. You got it? - Yeah. - All right, good. Yeah, these shoes are much... much better. Does it have to be so tight? Yes, it does. Child, for the money you getting paid... we can strangle you. OK. We'll loosen it after the show, Kelly. Don't worry about it. Hey, yo, Teesha. Can we speak to you for a minute, please? Come on, y'all, I can't talk to y'all right now. I've got work to do here. My first show in New York is tonight. It's kind of important. All right. Dana, come here. Something's wrong in here. Could you-- I don't know what it is. Just fix it, please. Outfit is really fly. It's a new fabric. Imported, thank you. Now look, y'all, we all from the same neighborhood... and I really want to help y'all out. Don't get me wrong. But this is my shit happening here tonight, OK? And I'm not gonna let y'all mess this up for me. Check this out. We're not here to mess nothing up. We're here to find... a little bit more about Mr. Demetrius. Well, what do you want to know about him? He's my financial backer... and he imports this new fiber for me. From Germany? How'd you know that? Where's the warehouse? In Brooklyn. Why? Don't worry about it. We got it. Whatever. I got work to do. I'll see y'all later. Save that drama though. Word up. Ed Lover. What's up, Sherise? There she is, baby. Baby, y'all look so good. What the hell you doing... telling people I'm sleeping with you? - Sherise-- - Un-uh! Un-uh! Yo, I'm telling you, Ed Lover... don't fuck with me! Ow! Sherise? Sherise! I didn't-- 3 times this week. Third one. She smacked me right in my fucking band-aid, too. Come on. I swear to God, man. How you gonna smack a man with a band-aid on? Man, I hope we ain't down here... wasting our time, man. Man, I feel we're getting real close now. We're gonna find something down here... and nail him on it. I hope so, man. Yo, man, yo, Teesha likes me. What?! What Teesha want... with somebody like you, man? She likes me. Why does every girl in the world... gotta like you, man? They don't have to. They just do, man. So you're bugging. No, no, you bugging. You bugging. Yo, I'm not bugging, man. You're bugging. Man, it's dark in here. That because it's nighttime, man. Stop wasting time. Come on. Yo, what's the number we're looking for? 3 and 4. Ok. There's 3, there's 4. It's over here. Bingo. God, please. Let's get to work. There ain't nothing in these crates... except this damn fabric. Keep looking, man. You'll find something. There's gotta be something in here. Damn. Thing's tight. Crazy. I can't believe this. How do you get this open? Damn, the thing's locked up tight, too. Wait a minute. Look what we got here. Mm. Smart enough to put Teesha's name... all over the crates, too. We're gonna nail his ass. We got him, kid. Got him. Drop it! Call the boss. Aw, come on, fellas. You know the bad guys are gonna lose. That's word up. Just like in ''The Magnificent Seven.'' Yep. I like that movie. Or Bill Cosby and Sidney Poitier... in ''Uptown Saturday Night.'' I like that. Shut up! Demetrius. Yeah, boss. Yeah, we got 'em. No. That won't be a problem. Can I place a call-- Shut up! Say good night, boys. Don't do it! You guys all right? Yeah. What took you so damn long? Proper police procedure. Griles. What are you guys doing here? Demetrius is smuggling guns. This warehouse is full of them. You got a search warrant? Griles, we ain't cops no more. Who gives a damn about a search warrant? Can we please go pick up Mr. Demetrius? These shoes are killing me. Go ahead, Kelly. Just keep complaining. You'll be modeling post office uniforms... I'm telling you. Get up there! All you do is complain. What's happening, baby? Didn't I see you... on the cover of ''Essence Magazine?'' Oh, shit. I know you ain't trying to dis me... with that bright-ass orange carpet on your head. Fuck you! Shit! Hey, yeah. Hey! What's happening, baby? Didn't I see you... on the cover of ''Essence Magazine?'' What have you been telling people... about my business affairs, Lionel? I don't know what you're talking about. Don't bother prevaricating. Those 2 moronic police officer friends of yours... have gotten in my way for the last time. They've finally been taken care of. And you can be taken care of, too. Don't threaten me, Demetrius. I don't have to threaten you, Lionel. Sashay, sashay, sashay! Yo, Lamar. Oh, Doctor Dré, Ed Lover, how y'all doing? Lamar, where's Demetrius at? Oh, he's over there in a fabulous suit. 6 buttons, buttery leather shoes-- All right, thanks, Lamar. All right, y'all. Bye. Demetrius, where you going? I'm sorry. Something came up. I have to go. Oh, you can't leave now! The show is great, but I have to go. Come on, Demetrius, don't go! Freeze! You're under arrest. Your chief is gonna be awfully upset... when he hears how I've been treated. First, he's gonna hear about those guns... you running through Teesha's warehouse. And then we're gonna pin Nick's murder... - to your ass. - That's absurd. If there's any guns in Ms. Braxton's warehouse... I know nothing about it. And as far as Nick Crawford goes... I never murdered anyone. If you didn't, then who did? You ever read the bible? The book of ''Daniel'' says, ''Every man's sword shall be against his brother.'' Man, what the hell are you talking about? Hello, yes. This is Lionel Douglas. I want to book a flight for Jamaica. Yes, tonight, yes, yes. You already have my credit card number there. Yes. Come on, come on, come on. Lionel Douglas. Right, that's it, yes. OK, that's tonight, right? OK. I'll be there. Thank you. Why'd you go to work for Demetrius, Lionel? What are you doing in my house?! We had a talk with him tonight. I smoothed over... some uptown feathers for the man. There's nothing wrong with that. What's in Jamaica, man? Vacation. Kind of a spur of the moment thing, huh? Yes, Ed. What else were you doing for Demetrius? I told you. Nothing else? What's your point, Ed? This is my point. We found a warehouse full of guns... out in Brooklyn, and maybe you know about that. And maybe you know who killed Nick. I don't know anything about warehouse guns... or who put that bullet in Nick. Bullet? Everybody thinks Nick was killed in an explosion. The police didn't say nothing about no bullet. How'd you know he got shot, Lionel? Where you there? Why'd you kill Nick, man? I tried to save Nick. I said, ''Nicky... sell the property.'' But he wouldn't listen. What was I supposed to do? That shit don't make no difference, man. Nick loved you. You killed your best friend... you sorry motherfucker! Just shut up! Just shut up! Demetrius was setting me up. He was gonna ruin me... and I couldn't let that happen. I'm on my way now... to take care of Mr. Demetrius. But now, I have to... take care of you first, Ed. I am sorry, Ed. Not as sorry as I am. You all right, man? Yeah, I'm straight, man. Son of a-- Well, boys... Demetrius and Lionel are behind bars. I still don't know why anyone would want to kill Nick. There's a lot of sick people in this world. The important thing is that you guys were right. How'd you like to rejoin the department? No, I don't think so. Not even if I made you... the youngest detectives on the force? - Nope. - No, I don't think so. We're not cut out for police work, man. Nah, too violent. Well, what are you guys gonna do? I mean, it's not like you found oil. You guys need jobs. We'll think of something. You know us. Yo, check this out. I'm going to the store... to get us some more 40 ouncers... so we can all celebrate. Forty... Go grab a beam, man. Hey, George, help Mickey with that beam, man. All right. Yo, Dré. Check this out, man. I miss Nick, man. So do I, man. Oh. Oh, y'all just got men working in here. Where's all the women at? What's up, Teesha? How y'all doin'? Sorry how everything turned out. Yeah, well, you know, life goes on. Hey, we could always use another barber. No, got a job. Thank you. Dré, where the hell you get that cannon from, man? I hate rats, man. Yo, what's that black stuff? I worked for 3 hours for this shit. I'm telling you, this new Spike Lee joint... they're ''Crooklyn,'' man. Ed told me this is the new Arsenio. - Arsenio who? - Arsenio Hall. Nah, Dré told me this is Arsenio Hall cut. It's the ''New Jack City, Part 7.'' See, I know Wesley. He wouldn't go out like that. This original Shabba Ranks? I got your Shabba Ranks, Buster. See you later. Yo, Dré, I thought once we struck oil, man... we wouldn't have to work here no more. I know, man. I thought... things were gonna get better... being rich and wealthy now-- We'd be laying on beaches... with girls with little bikinis. Know what I'm saying? Third time in 2 days... you cut my hair, man. I can't help it. We ain't got no customers. They got all the damn customers. Look at 'em. Yeah, Dré and his Fat Albert ass. Man, like he stink! - Mmm! - Mmm! And the world's coming to an end. - Mm-hmm! - Mm-hmm! Hey, guys, can I get a cut? Whoo Come on Whoo Come on Who's the man with the master plan? Who's the man? Who's the man? Who's the man with the master plan? Hey, how you guys been? Just great, Sarge. Can you hold your head to the side, Sarge? That looks great, Sarge. You know, if you had a pony tail... everything would be just right. Oh, is that right? Ow, ow! What are you doing? Nothing. Don't worry about it, Sarge. I got this. We professionals. Remember? I'll take that. Ouch! Ow. Move your head to the left, Sarge. What's that thing for? Don't worry about that. These won't hurt at all. Professionals. We're professionals. Put your head down, please. Down. This is what we did before we were police offices. Couldn't you use the mirrors? Ow, ow. Oh, we will be using mirrors before it's done. How's things down at the precinct, Sarge? Good. Ok. Down there. Could you hold your head down to the side, please, sir? You know, you really are bashful... I'm not paying for this. Could you just kind of turn your head this way! Ow! I used to kick it with the thugs Pushin' drugs in the park Makin' every mark That was out after dark Stick 'em for their loot Cut 'em up, then l'd dash And when I had to shoot I'd nutted up for the cash Ran down the block with my .45 Glock Capped off a round, everybody hit the ground The next thing I heard was a siren Couldn't turn around, money grip kept firin' Runnin' for the ride, I can't go inside I'd rather that I died, I got too much pride I guess it's just something that you can't understand My gun's in my hand, tell me who's the man?
