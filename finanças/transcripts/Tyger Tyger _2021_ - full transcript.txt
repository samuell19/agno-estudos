All right, uh, just take your clothes off. What? Just fucking take your clothes off. Why? Dude, take off your fucking clothes. What's your name? Luke.

[TENSE MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, this is from little kids' book. LUKE: It's from when I left home. Used to be my lucky shirt. When did it stop being lucky? When you stole it.

Okay, so let's get these meds to the doctor in Free City. This is the address where you're gonna drop off the medication, all right? Joe will make the introduction. Cole's worried if, um... If we give it all away, then there won't be anything left for him or us. Cole's what got you in this room. Now, Joe's the man who knows the doctor. He used to live in Free City, where they don't have medication. Is he sick, too? [CHUCKLES] It's not your concern. You meet Joe... you deliver the meds... and you haul your ass to Mexico. And don't worry about Cole. I'll bring him out to you. DR. ROSA: Send the next person in. Here, take a condom. It's free. MAN: I'll take the mask... [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Brown Sugar Bakery.

They're trying to make money off of you. And you know how I know? You know how I fucking know? I'm a junkie. That's how I fucking know. It's exactly how I fucking know. So, please. Please just... I'll find a pay phone. I'll walk home. I'll call... I won't call the cops because I... I split the same way that you did at that place. Just let me go, because if you don't give me that shit, leave me with that, I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be throwing up. Okay, fine. Bobby, start the car. - LUKE: Just... - What is she doing? Fuck! Fuck. You don't know what I did to get that shit... The fucking cake.

He just needs some fresh air. - Yeah? - Yeah. JOE: Yeah. Fresh air. Contagious? I mean, he might have some kind of flu or something. Wait, wait, wait. You gotta put this on him. I mean, I'm, uh... [SIGHS] Trying to get dinner ready, so, you know, I want to stay healthy for us all. You know. Health first, right? [LAUGHING] BLAKE: [CHUCKLING] Okay. [REFRIGERATOR OPENS] You want a drink?

You don't go bad fashion so that I can get a fucking girl over here, anyway. So I'm just fucking happy to share it with you guys, right? Well, Rosa said you were gonna take us - down to the Free City, introduce us to the doctor. - Oh. It's waiting game out here, you know. You have to wait a while. I don't know what you mean. She said, um, that they knew we were coming, and they needed it, what we're bringing. - [DOOR OPENS] - JOE: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, man. Hey, I don't want you around this... This food, man.

BLAKE: We have enough from the doctor. - [WOMAN CONTINUES ON RADIO] - [PILLS CLATTERING] I mean, why don't you guys just stay here for the night? We'll go meet the doctor in the morning.

No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look. You know, there's another thing I like about crab. When they catch these sons of bitches, they throw them all in one bucket, keep them alive and fresh. And those crabs must know they're gonna get eaten, because when one of them tries to get out, the other ones... They pinch at it. They pinch at it. They pinch at it. They pull it back in. Right? They think, "If we ain't getting out, you ain't getting out. "If you ain't getting out... "We swimming in one big bucket." Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa! - BLAKE: Are you okay? - I need medication. That's it. We all do. See? We're all need the medication right now. Go count it, boy. [JOE LAUGHING] BLAKE: What the fuck's going on? My name is... I think he's gonna call the cops. BLAKE: What? There was a radio in there. He knows that you guys took me. - BLAKE: Let's, um... - Fucking go. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Crabby son of a bitch. The hell you think you're doing, huh, leaving with that sick kid? Leave him right here with the medication pills. Leave him here with that medication. [TIRES SCREECHING] [CHILD GIGGLES] [SCREAMING] DR. ROSA: But, Jack, you let her leave. You let the fucking meds go. This is what happens when you chase the problem and not the cure. Look what you've done now. JOE: I don't need mutes and drug addicts stealing meds. How about I take down this little illegal robbery pharmaceutical operation you got going on here [YELLING] and I get me some fucking reward money? [ECHOING] DR. ROSA: But, Blake, you can't go there by yourself. It's dangerous. He used to practice medicine in the Free City. He helped so many people. I'll call Joe for you and find out. Yeah, but he fucking tried to rob us or set us up. Just tell me where you are. Don't tell her where we are. - I'll send Cole to get you, okay? He's almost done. - No. Just, um... No, just tell him I'm coming back, okay? Blake. LUKE: Who? The guy who was at the pharmacy with me. So, the guy you robbed the pharmacy with, who fucking threw me in the back room that you then robbed to give the drugs to the doctor. That's not what was supposed to happen. We were supposed to give them away. But he then wanted to fucking keep them all for himself. To sell them? No. Um... He... He's pretty sick, actually. Thinks it's my fault. Is it your fault? No. So where is he now? He's at the clinic, waiting for me. Don't trust too many people. Excuse me, ma'am. Um, we're trying to find a doctor. We have an appointment. This ain't a hospital. [CLEARS THROAT] [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] You need to talk to Emerald about Jack. She's been waiting for you. Okay, where is she? She's in the Free City. You're in the $35 a night city, you know. If he's gonna be bumping into stuff, he can't be in here. He just can't be in here if he's gonna be stumbling around. I saw him right when he came in. What month is it? It's... June. Uh, wait, July. It's July. Could you call her? - [CHUCKLES] - [RADIO CHATTER CONTINUES] Any other local? This is local. You just have to listen to it. - Really, really listen. - [APPLAUDING ON RADIO] MAN: [ON RADIO] With a two shot lead, Grady hits a driver way to the right on 15.

All right. Luke, why don't you take this out to Bobby? Snitches get stitches, the thieves feed the trees. At least that's what happened to my friend last week. LUKE: Yeah, well, you know, we stole this from her friend. He was a desert fisherman. I think she needs some new friends. Why don't you go, um... Yeah, maybe some people who... Okay, do you wanna go outside? WOMAN: Um, our hotel is full right now, so you need to go and stay with Emerald, stay in the camp. You've got a nice wet map. You know what to do. Start at East Jesus. East Jesus. Well, you keep coming on back, now. And bring a friend, if you have any lady.

[GIGGLES] Do you guys know this Joe guy? That was who was supposed to take us here. - Joe? - I know a Jack. I only know a guy named Jack. I don't know a Joe. He lived in a phone booth out here for 10 years and talked to everyone that called it, - mostly wrong numbers, but... - It doesn't work anymore. That's the only people he talked to. - Someone burned it. - And, uh, these were his dreadlocks. I'm trying to grow mine out in honor of him. Where's the mute girl going? - We have to swim in order to survive. - [FOOTSTEPS] In order to survive. We need to swim. You don't know how to swim? Well, I'm sorry, but... [CHUCKLES] you're lost.

We have the real thing. That's what he needs. - Have the real thing. - [LUKE SIGHS] Look, we have the meds, but we're only gonna trade it for methadone, okay? Uh, or, I got cash, so how much do... EMERALD: Cash doesn't do anything out here. Okay, if you guys don't know this doctor, do you at least know someone that can take us? To someone that knows, like... Yo, I'm the doctor, God damn it. We're gonna get down to trade in what I want. Are you ready? Trade for what I want? LUKE: Do you not want cash? [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING] EMERALD: We're all waiting out here. We're all waiting. EMERALD: Hi... I am so sorry. MAN: Hi. It's just that place, you know? It's like it's so weird in there, right? And I guess, you know, just strangers in this place, just sometimes you never know, right? You just have to be careful and make sure that... - Thanks. - [CHUCKLES] I'm good. You sure you should be doing that right now? LUKE: I don't care. I'm sorry about what I said about the meds. They... They may work. I don't know. I'm fucked up. Are you sure you don't wanna know the results? Yeah. LUKE: We both risked our lives. Just different drugs, but same high. No, I risked my life to help others. There's a big difference. Happy when you get your fix like me. No, I mean, you willingly take yours. Mine was given to me. It's different. Well, I think, um... [CLEARS THROAT] that both people were risking their lives, do it to numb out... You know. It's like we all get pricked by something. Sometimes it's dangerous. That's all going to kill us in the end. I would just rather take a hot shot of heroin and have sex with someone who may have a disease, and make me die slower. Sounds like a waste of life. It's kinda selfish. Kinda selfish to think that you can fix everyone. It's narcissistic, actually. I don't think I can fix everyone. I just like... I can't sit in a room with people that are in pain and not do anything. I mean, I have to help. [CHUCKLES] - What? - It's still kind of selfish. - How? - It's still kind of selfish, because you're uncomfortable sitting in a room when there's someone in pain, but it's your uncomfort, you know. It's like... It's about your uncomfort. What are you... So you can't even be comfortable just sitting here by a fire. I mean, nothing's wrong, you know? You're like... You're hot, you're cold. You want that, well... Wow. No. [BOTH LAUGH] - EMERALD: You gotta eat. - [LUKE CLEARS THROAT] Do you know where you're staying tonight? Would you like to stay in my dead bus? - [ALL LAUGHING] - What is that? All right. Okay, it's a... It's a mattress. It's roofed, there's light. And then Bobby can stay with me if she wants. It sounds really good. - EMERALD: Yeah? - Yeah. He probably needs to lie down. Good. Everyone, you just grab a torch because it is very, very dark. [COYOTE HOWLING] Um, also, quick warning. My little friend Cody is gonna... be so excited if he sees you, because he always celebrates his birthday every single day of the year. But he never shows up. CODY: Hey, you left my fliers to my birthday. EMERALD: Oh, Cody. BLAKE: Cool. - When's this? - Tonight. BLAKE: Tonight? All right. EMERALD: We're coming. I promise you. I'll just need to give them some new clothes. BLAKE: You wanna go? LUKE: I'm not gonna go. I don't feel good. Hey, Emerald, is there a place he could lay down? Yes. Yes, yes, yes. CODY: Luke. Are you sure you don't wanna come to my party? - LUKE: I'm sure, man. - You suck. - [EMERALD CHUCKLES] - LUKE: This little shit. EMERALD: Okay, just put your torches down. [SIGHS] All right. Welcome. Uh, almost everything you need will be in this bus. I will get some more stuff for him. And then we can get ready for... - CODY: My party! - ...Cody's birthday party. Okay, I'll see you in a bit. CODY: Bobby, Emerald wants to show you where you're sleeping. BLAKE: Hey, are you okay? LUKE: Mmm. BLAKE: All right. I hope he feels better. BLAKE: It doesn't look so scary to me. LUKE: He's got a sword on it. - EMERALD: It's the ace of spades. - [ALL LAUGHING] - Oh, wow. Holy shit. - LUKE: Wow. That sounds good. And it means focus and clarity. So clear your mind, man, and focus. MAN: I guess we're both fucked. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY] You feel better now? Yeah. LUKE: I don't know it exists in me, but... - I think it's like gasoline. - [COUGHING] It's highly... [CHUCKLES] Highly volatile, but it mellows out when I shoot up. BLAKE: It sounds very scary. LUKE: It's not scary to people who have it in their veins. It's only scary to those who don't. [GUITAR PLAYING] Everything exists in you. [GUITAR CONTINUES PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] BLAKE: You know, there's a kid I know that... He OD'd and died of, like, uh... Over the summer. Um, this kid, Russell, and I feel like if he could have found a place like this, he would have been okay. But he was, like, really trapped. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: It's just really opened my eyes to the reality, and like, how fucked up reality can be. - Did you meet Bobby? - No. - MAN: What's up, buddy? - Hi. You okay? Yeah, I'm... I'm okay. You don't look like it. [CHUCKLES] What's up? - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [GUITAR CONTINUES PLAYING] This car rolls up and it was just like, out the window, like, all four windows rolled down. And like, AKs, like shotguns come out the window and they just light this kid up, like, 24 years old, man. Like, I almost got hit by the car, the car that was there in the drive by. And I looked in... I looked at them for a bit of a glance, and I looked at their faces, and none of them... It was like they were just riding down the road. They shot this kid to death. Rolled away, and were just driving like nothing happened. WOMAN: Hey. - Hey. - You're the girl from the hotel. Yeah. You're the sick kid, and his girlfriend. You find that room or what? Yeah. Yeah, we did. She's taken care of us. That's great, right? You know, um, if you need a place to stay, you just let me know, okay? Okay? Great. MAN: See you later. Want some? Oh, yeah. Thanks. MAN: Bye. I get a weird vibe... - [GUITAR PLAYING] - [INDISTINCT SINGING] It's all kind of a vibe. [DOG BARKING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [PLAYFULLY] You're so funny. Are you teething? Do you need help? MAN: Thanks, guys, I really appreciate it. LUKE: No problem. BLAKE: What's your name? - My name is Ryan. - Hi, Ryan. I'm Blake. LUKE: What do you normally sell on this? RYAN: Oh, we have chickens and ducks, and we sell their eggs. BLAKE: And then they don't use money here, right? So you trade? - We trade for things, yeah. - That's cool. - Didn't expect to work out today, huh? - [CHUCKLES] I don't expect to work out any day, really. Hello, sir. He's got the hair. RYAN: Welcome. BLAKE AND LUKE: Thank you. - BOTH: Wow. - Welcome right inside. BLAKE: Thank you for letting us... Thanks for helping me. - Did you build all this? - Yeah. Bit by bit. Uh, all the pieces that... Hat. Okay. Cowboy. You met a cowboy? Needles and shit... Yeah. He's a junkie? The cowboy j... The cowboy junkie! Okay. Yeah, I... I know who he... Yeah. I m... I saw him at the skate park. RYAN: Uh, all this water waters the gardens. Uh, we have peppers growing, and tomatoes, loofah sponge. LUKE: How did you learn how to do this? BLAKE: Yeah. RYAN: Slowly but surely. I like him. Can you bring him over later? You can bring him over? So I'll be around. Go that way. These are the little ones. They're all rescues. - BLAKE: Oh. cool. - We brought all the chickens in from other places around. People that couldn't keep their chickens any longer or didn't realize how hard it is to keep chickens in the desert. - Mmm-hmm. - Um, so... - Do you guys have eggs? - Yeah, we do. BLAKE: Oh, wow. LUKE: Oh, you really do. Emerald. - Hey! - There she is. Where's Blake and Luke? Well, they're somewhere. They left her at the skate park. RYAN: Found one, I see, that's stamped. BLAKE: Yeah, what's... How's that... LUKE: Yeah. RYAN: They don't come out that way. What I often do is I put in a store-bought egg if they haven't been laying, 'cause it'll entice the other chickens to lay an egg. They're gonna come over later. But Luke is gonna come see me... - after he sees you, okay? - EMERALD: All right. So just... don't let him forget, okay? - EMERALD: I won't. - All right. You have fun in there. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hey, this is my house. Buy anything from the cart? Eggs and art. LUKE: Have an egg on the house. Enjoy your eggs. BLAKE: I don't think there's anyone on the bus. - LUKE: Is there ever anyone on the bus? - [CHUCKLES] Hi. - Hey, guys. - BLAKE: Hey. We have some wares for trade, if you want to trade anything. And we have fresh eggs also. I don't have anything on me, but I'm... I'm desperate for some eggs. - Okay. Well, uh... - Yeah, I like this. That's really pretty. Well, that's like four eggs. - Five. - Five eggs? That's, like, five eggs. We'll trade you for something. - Okay. For real? - Yeah. - Okay. - Do you want that, if we trade? BLAKE: Yeah. - Yeah. It's really pretty. - So it's six eggs, - like I said before. - You did not. [LAUGHS] - You said four eggs. - No, I said six eggs. - I never lie. - That's all we have. How's this? What if we give you... What if we give you four eggs and one egg for free? WOMAN: Well, man, this is... This is all I got. Can you hold all... All of those? - I got pockets. I got... Look. - Okay. - LUKE: Okay. - These are my egg pockets. Because you will... Because you want this for real. BLAKE: Okay, thank you. Thank you. Can we have the necklace now? Oh, the necklace. Oh. [BLAKE AND LUKE LAUGH] I almost forgot. You were gonna give us for four. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Well, thanks, guys. - BLAKE: Yeah. - You're welcome. - Bye. Thank you for getting this for me. - I didn't do much. - [LAUGHING] - You should probably thank the chickens. - I know. BLAKE: Hey. EMERALD: Hey. You guys just left Bobby. BLAKE: I'm sorry, Bobby. All right, well, welcome to my house. Uh, and I got some good news. We got hot water. - BLAKE: Well, really, for tea? - No, for a shower. Um, but we... Like, only six minutes 'cause we need the rest for the tea. Um, and then Bobby wants to show Luke to some friends. LUKE: I'm good. Okay, sit down. This is the craziest shower I've ever... I feel like an ape.

[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING] [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] (MELODIOUS SONG PLAYING) [SONG ENDS] BLAKE: The tiger is from Nepal. Then you know it burns. Is that lucky? [SOBBING] Fuck. Fuck. [EXHALES] Who gave you this shirt? LUKE: My mom read me this poem to put me to sleep. I would picture that burning tiger with the one on the shirt you stole. That's not why it's lucky, though. She thought it was the tiger and the shirt that put me to sleep. I knew it wasn't. The shirt's lucky because it's the only thing I was wearing when she found me on the bathroom floor, unconscious, not breathing. And when I woke up from the coma, all I thought about was my dope and my shirt. I asked the doctor, but he just kept screaming about how my life amounted to 10 feet, 10 feet from the bathroom floor to the bedroom. And how lucky I was that I didn't make that walk. How lucky I was that she found me. How lucky I was that I didn't fall asleep that night. But I was just thinking how lucky I was that they didn't cut the shirt.

How many bags you got? I can take them for you. I got a sick daughter who's with a boyfriend and this girl who lost her voice. You seen them? I see a lot of people check in here. A lot of them can't talk. Do you know where you are? You need a map? Yeah. Yeah. You know, I lived here once. How long have you been stuck here? Oh, I'm not stuck here. I like it here. Not the motel, but this city. What's you name, Jack? Name's Joe. You need a ride to your camp? What, do you want to give me a ride to my camp or what? - I do indeed. I do indeed. - You do indeed.

Just save me a seat, brother, or a train to anywhere. Look at these fucking idiots. Look, you did your mission. Let me do mine. I see. It sounds like you're trying to make money. I'm just trying to get these drugs to people who deserve to live. Not... people at the end of the road. Listen, you... You've been away a long time, you know. You've got a lot of people who wanna see you and shit. - It's been a long time, and I have changed. - [GUITAR CONTINUES STRUMMING] How's that? [LAUGHING] I'm joking, man. - [LAUGHS] - Let's go get the fucking meds, man. We're all just waiting... for some... For a rich white kid to die. It's crazy, but it's true. Our time will come. I guarantee it. Oh, boy. [TAPPING, SCRAPING] - BLAKE: If you had people here... - [BLAKE AND EMERALD LAUGH] Sometimes... Somebody tries to steal them 'cause they don't have shoes, and I'm like, "You can't take my... My walls." Um, did you see my homecoming pics? They're, like, all from homecoming. Yeah. - You know, um, Tammie? - Mmm-hmm. She has, like, a family album with photos of the same people in different times and places. I wish I had that instead, but... No, these are cool. I've never seen homecoming photos without, like, all the makeup and the dresses. Makeup? Yeah, like, um, lipstick or... blush. - You don't know... - [LAUGHS] No. What? What? It's like... Like a face paint or something. But why makeup our faces when they're already maked up? You're right. I don't under... [CHUCKLES] People do it to, like, look different or... Hey. Um... EMERALD: Ooh. Well... I wanna try it. We can do it tonight. What's tonight? Homecoming night! - LUKE: Yeah? - Yeah! - I love homecoming. - EMERALD: You do? Okay, sweet. You cannot wear that shirt, though. BLAKE: Well, he burned his other one. - His lucky shirt. - Wh... Why would you burn it? It was unlucky. Okay, but why'd you burn it when you could have just given it away? BLAKE: Hmm. What do you have over there? Maybe you have something for him? Um, yes. Okay. Uh, feel free to, like, put on anything, touch anything. Whatever you want is... It's yours. Um, do you think I should wear that? LUKE: Doesn't look like there's many male options in here. BLAKE: We're gonna find something. EMERALD: I don't think I've ever worn it. LUKE: Doesn't matter, I guess. EMERALD: There's no difference. You can wear... - I like that shirt... - [EMERALD HUMMING] I always find so much inspiration, like, for my dresses when I look at these pictures. - LUKE: It kinda makes me sick, Emerald. - [BLAKE LAUGHS] Did you make them, or did... - Yes. - LUKE: Oh. I'm sorry. - It's all right. - Is this a homecoming shirt? EMERALD: That's the homecoming shirt. Leave a little bit of the chest hair out. - I saw you with Blake. - Oh. EMERALD: Mmm-hmm. EMERALD: And this, people do to look different? BOBBY: Mmm-hmm. [EMERALD AND BOBBY CHUCKLING] BLAKE: Emerald, when does the dance start? EMERALD: It starts when we get there. [BLAKE CHUCKLES] EMERALD: And then see the stars and point to the shooting stars and the constellations. And then see the sunrise over the beach. It's burning red hot. JINXY: Welcome. Welcome. Choose a card. EMERALD: We should probably get going soon, though... [WHISPERING] so we get the whole night. Oh, my. Where are you going? BLAKE: Um, I'm not sure right now. - Can you tell me? - Interesting. JINXY: I can't. The cards don't even know. You pulled a card of confusion. - The Lord of Swiftness. - [DOG YELPS] You're on the move. [DOGS BARKING, GROWLING] Hey! LUKE: Hey! Hey! [BOBBY CHUCKLES] What is it? Oops. [CHUCKLES] I feel like a doctor. Or a painter. It's so nice to have people in the house. BLAKE: Mmm. EMERALD: [WHISPERING] I love picking seashells. - I feel like I could fall asleep. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] BLAKE: Is there someone there that will take a picture of us? EMERALD: I hope so. I need one for my collection. And this time it... It will be me coming with real people - and not just the dogs. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] BLAKE: Luke? Luke. Wake up. JINXY: With the sun, there's fire behind you, and sometimes you tend to get burned by your own fire and strength. - [GIRLS GIGGLING] - You can't let that happen. - [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] - JINXY: Pull another one. Go ahead. Wow. This is such an interesting reading. You got The High Priestess. So, The High Priestess is a very interesting card. Uh, divine femininity. There's a lot of power in the direction you're going. Even though you may be lost, you'll find your path, or it will find you. You guys seem like you're gonna need some guidance on your trip... wherever that may be. BLAKE: I don't know, sometimes I make up stories about someone I've never even met before, like, um... I don't know, it's not real. Just something special about them. It's like a fantasy. - A fantasy? - BLAKE: Yeah. Blink once for "no" and twice for "yes." A fantasy love? Yeah. I wanna try that. - Do you like eating human food? - [DOGS BARKING] Are you in love? With the fantasy one or the real one? - [WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] - LUKE: Can you howl?

Did you burn those meds? Did you burn 'em in the car? Would l really burn them? - You think I would burn them? - I didn't believe that you'd burn them. Um, that's Jack. We have... We have to go. We have to go now. Just tell me. Come on. Oh, my God. BLAKE: Pack up our stuff. [ALL PANTING] Hey, let's take off the makeup. [CHUCKLES] I don't really think I liked it. Okay, um... Thank you. [BREATHES HEAVILY] What are you doing? We're just getting ready for bed, I think. What are you talking about? We have to go. No... No. We have to wait. What are we waiting for, Emerald? I have to go find Luke. - What the hell just happened... - Luke is sick, okay? But not like us. The bad kind of sick. The forgotten kind of sick. - Wake up, sick. - [MAN LAUGHING] Where are the fucking pills? We know you didn't burn them. You didn't burn them meds. You're a fucking thief! LUKE: They're in the car, man. JOE: See, you know, you burned that fucking car. My mother, she was sick, too, so she... She went into the bathroom, right there, where you just were, um, and... And shot herself with a .38. EMERALD: [CHUCKLES] Yeah. She didn't die right away. Then, I think I was there for... For two hours before my dad found us. But it was me alive and her dead. He... He thinks that I did it. Yeah, he says I'm the reason for, you know, putting poison in her. That I've been killing her for nine months. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] But my dad also told me that... That God... He makes us all in these big, big batches, right? But he lets one or two stars just slip by, you know. And they're... They're just too magical for this world. They're too bright, even. And they're so sensitive that they just burn up quickly. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] JOE: Stop. Stop. Do it. JOE: Yeah, that's right. - Do it. - No, man, I'm not gonna shoot. Shoot me. Do it! Do it! [BREATHING HEAVILY] - [GUN CLICKS EMPTY] - [JOE LAUGHING] EMERALD: I used to think that... That it must have been God who put me in her stomach to poison her. But then, I think my dad chose to poison himself by... By putting a needle in his arm. But I also know that I'm... I'm not poison. You know, maybe... Maybe I am just like her. That I am so sensitive that it makes all the other people that surround me, uncomfortable, because my bright magic comes at times when it is truly needed, you know. But it's that same magic that burns itself up. And so, we need to take care of those people. And when it's their time to burn, we have to let them burn. I'm gonna go, um... find Luke, okay? Luke has already left you. - You don't know that. - [BOBBY SOBS] Bobby knows. BLAKE: What do you... What do you mean? EMERALD: We both know. [BOBBY SOBBING SOFTLY] EMERALD: [SOFTLY] Hey. - [BOBBY SOBBING] - BLAKE: Bobby, what are you doing? What are you guys doing? What the fuck are you doing? [SOBBING] What the fuck are you doing? BLAKE: Luke. Luke. Who's Luke? The kid from the pharmacy? Like, you just fucking left me in there in that clinic. [SCOFFS] You put me in there.
