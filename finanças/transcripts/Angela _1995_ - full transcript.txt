I mean, they never did anything even slightly wrong. But then Lucifer, he was the prettiest angel and the smartest. See, he wanted to take God's place. But soon, God heard what Lucifer was thinking and he tried to kill Lucifer, and the good angels and the bad angels had a war in Heaven. Then God won. And he threw all the bad angels off of Heaven, down through the clouds, down to this Earth. And now, they live in the world, and they try to take people to their place, which is Hell. That's why you have to be clean inside. They spill badness in you and they take you. Lucifer is the worst angel, a king. And he looks all day, all night, looking for fresh souls. He's extremely bad. -Where does he live now? -[Angela] Different places. Right now, he's staying in the basement. -Our basement? -He wants to take one of us away. -Who? -Depends. -Depends on what? -On who has more sin. See, every sin weighs just so much.

And there was a woman, clothed by the sun with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of 12 stars. And she was pregnant. And she screamed in pain because the child was coming. And behold, a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns stood before the woman who was to give birth because the dragon wanted to eat the child. Now a war rose in Heaven, and the angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back but were defeated. The ancient serpent, who was called the Devil or Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, he was thrown down to Earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
