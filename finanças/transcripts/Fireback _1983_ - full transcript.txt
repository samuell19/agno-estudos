Good morning gentlemen. I see that you're all here. You're about to see something different. This is the 'One Man Army Gun'. Codenamed 'Omega'. And I'm here to personally introduce, demonstrate- and supervise the operation of this new weapon. Especially designed for this type of warfare- here in Vietnam. With this weapon you have the firepower of one platoon in your hand. This is a multi-caliber gun... with a built-in radio... automatic rifle... and this is a .30 caliber machine gun. The barrel of each caliber has its own built-in firing pin- which locks on to the specially made trigger. This is the grenade launcher. Bazooka. And this is a mini-missile. And another feature is... an infra-red telescopic sight. It can magnify an object five times- at a distance of 5,000 yards. And the most important thing... It's very easy to handle. Any questions? Load. Get up. Subtitles by Obscuritron Hi, how is Diane? - I don't know. - Oh? I have tried everything, but nothing seems to work. I don't know what to do, it's terrible. She doesn't seem to want to know me anymore. I offered her flowers but she wouldn't accept them. I know that during all this time- she was very lonely. I gave her gifts- but she also refused them. I tried to be nice to her- but the more I tried- the more she rejected me. Now I'd like you to look for somebody- who can make sure that she comes back to me. You've gotta help me out. You must try. No problem. Go now. We have received an intelligence report- that some of our men are still alive- and being help prisoners at a Vietcong camp. There is a possibility that Jack Kaplan is among those prisoners. I want you to lead the rescue team- as soon as the camp is pinpointed. Yes sir. Spread out. We'll meet at the rendezvous point at exactly 1500. Move! Move! Fast! Well. You surprised me with your fast recovery. Seems your really want to get out of this place. I just think being in hospital makes me feel worse. If that's the case- I'll prepare your papers before your condition changes. - Come on doc, I was kidding. - Alright. Hey nurse. Take this to my office along with the other records for this patient, okay? - Yes - Thank you. You're really in good shape now. I think you can go home tomorrow. You can get your discharge papers from the nurses station. Thanks. I really want to get home to my wife. Yeah, I understand. I'll be leaving you now. See you. Hello Jack. Something wrong? I've called my wife several times but the phone's always busy. Don't worry about that, it's the phones here. By the way, we prepared a party for you. A kind of heroes welcome. I want you to come around and meet the boys. That's real nice of you. But I just want to see my wife. I really do miss her very much. Hope you understand. Oh yeah, I understand. By the way, I got some money for you. Here, for the time being. - Right? - Thanks very much. Tell the guys good bye for me. Sure, and give my regards to your wife. By the way... Here's my car. Diane? Diane? Diane? Mike. Jack? Jesus Christ! I thought you were dead. You've seen my wife? No, I haven't. She hasn't been around for quite some time. Anything wrong? It's really good to see you back. Hey, you don't look too good. Is there something wrong? My wife's missing. No one knows where she is. And I don't know where to start looking for her. I think you might be able to find out something- from the man with the golden hand. He was sitting in the back just now. Thanks brother. See you. Hey man! Are you alright? Yeah... Glad to see you back alive, Jack. I thought you was dead, man. Like Angelsville, know what I mean? I need some information on a freak with a golden hand. Don't mind him, man. Jackie ain't nothing. He's worthless punk, you know? He may not mean much to you but he is important to me- and I want him. Well, the cat's name is Dennis- and he... well. Wow. Well man. He hangs out on 10th street. A place called Molly's. Thank's a lot, brother. Stay cool. Halt! Where's my wife? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. It's up to you. It's your head. Okay, hold it. I'll tell you. You can ask Eve, the girl at the club. She hired me. Hey, where do you think you're going? You can't just come pushing in here. I wanna see Eve. Where is she? Oh, I see. She's in the dressing room. You can go in there, but you better make it fast. Yeah? I'm a friend of Dennis's. Dennis? What do you want? I don't know you. Hey! What the hell do you think you're doing? Get out of here! I'm trying to find my wife Diane. I'm told you can help me. Listen buster, I'm not interested in your marital problems. Now get out of here. Listen lady. If you don't tell me what I want to know- then you'll have real trouble. It's Bart. Bart McNeil. Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing? Goddamned people. Hello? Duffy... This is Eve. Jack was just here. Dennis sent him. He nearly choked me to death. Where is he now? He's on his way... to Bart. Okay honey. Don't worry, I'll fix him. I hope you do. He's crazy. - Hello? - Shadow? There's something I want you to do for me. Hey man. What's happening, man? I didn't mean it. He gave me... a hundred bucks, man! I needed it, man. I'll double it for you. Take it. Go on. Take it back. Listen man. Hey, listen. I--I'm sorry, hey. Hey man. Take it easy, man. - You son of a bitch! - No! Hey wait-- Just keep coming out of there, slowly. What do you want from me? Just move it slowly. Listen... I'm tired. I want to hear some answers from you, and quickly. Where is my wife? Operator? Hello operator. I want you to connect me to the police station. Get me the police. Digger is dead. I know who did it. It was that soldier who's picture I saw in the newspaper. Alright, fine. I'd like to handle Diggers case myself. What's so special about him? Look, chief. That man was my informer. He helped us a lot- in putting a lot of lowlifes behind bars. We busted several cases- because of him. I wanna get this killer. Then you get this man. But remember... He is a Vietnam war veteran. A weapons specialist. He can make an ordinary soft drink straw into a weapon. So let me remind you... You be careful in dealing with him or else you are dead, my friend. Sir. Find anything? According to a neighbor our man appeared to go crazy- when he found out his wife was missing. You better check the bureau of missing persons and find out. For all we know he could well have found her sleeping with another man- and killed them both. That's why he went out of his mind- and maybe Digger was just another victim. Thank you sir. Go ahead. Duffy, Jack is still alive. I heard from the radio that he is now wanted by the police- for the murder of Bart and Digger. Do you want me to call the police? No. I wanna see that bastard dead. Where is he now? He's at 1225th Maple Street. It's just outside of town. Okay, just sit tight and don't let him out of your sight. I'll call somebody to take care of him. Sure thing. Who is it? I'm a repair man. I was told there is a leak in the toilet. Come back another time. But I have to do it now. Sorry to disturb you sir. - The bathroom's over there. - Thank you sir. Well, I can't see anything wrong with your toilet. There must have been some kind of a mistake. So I'll be going now. Hey kid, your bag. Yeah. Now tell me kid, who put you up to this? He promised me-- - He promised me a lot of money. - Who's "he"? Harry... Harry Johnson. Where do I find him? Alright Harry. - Who wanted you to kill me? - Stop it. - Anything wrong? - No, no. No sir. Your room is 206, Mr. Smith. Good evening ma'am. Can I help you? Has my husband checked in yet? Who is your husband? He's about this tall. He's wearing a black shirt... a white jacket, and he has a mustache. Well, a man just checked in wearing the clothes you've described. He's in room 206. - 206? - Yeah. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello? - Cat Burglar? - Sorry, you got the wrong number. - Listen. I got a job for you. What? Shit. Alright. You just drop that gun. Who sent you here? Talk! Who sent you here? Shit. I'm very worried. So far none of your men has been able to kill him. What if he finds out that I'm involved with his wife's kidnapping? He just might wanna kill me and that's worrying me. You're not that scared. You're damn right I am. Just take it easy. Leopard's already on his way. Hope that takes care of him. Thank you. What are you doing? I'm just trying to help you. Take it easy. Come on. There, now let's get you to the car. Have a drink. Thanks. Why are you helping me? Because you're wounded. I can't take you to a hospital- and the police are out looking for you. Aren't you afraid? You don't kill women, do you? Not yet. Have you found out anything yet about your wife? Nothing. I don't even know why she was kidnapped. I wish I could help you- but I've already told you everything that I know about your wife. I gotta go. Hold it. You're weak. You can't go. You better come upstairs with me and rest for a while. Don't worry, nobody knows you're here except me. Diane... Diane... What the hell are you doing? Alright now, the party is over. Where is my wife? She... No... No! Bitch. My god. Hey. Where do you think you're going? You've gone too far this time. You can find her- at the old fort. Your man is Duffy. Diane... Diane... Diane! We just received information that Jack Kaplan's wife is not missing. In fact, she was kidnapped. All these people that we have found dead- were very probably involved in the kidnapping. If the people involved in the kidnapping is still around- that means Jack's still here. Yeah. The big question is who are these people? We just received a report. Our men found Jack's wife. She is dead. I'm afraid that now- more dead bodies will turn up. I want you to alert our men. Also, I want you to put up roadblocks at every possible escape route. Yes sir. Look. We got company. You stay here. Hey, what the hell are you doing? Come on, what are you doing here? Help! Stop! Stop! - That murderer Jack Kaplan is down there. - Get in. We just missed Jack Kaplan. He's in a green sedan, heading north. - We have to get him to a hospital quickly. - Okay. - Yes - Can I talk to the chief? Speaking. I'm putting up a cash reward of $50,000 for Jack Kaplan. Dead or alive. Whoever you are... Look, we don't need your money. It's our duty to arrest the suspect and bring him to justice. Shit. Jack didn't pass through any of our roadblocks- but I've just received an intelligence report- saying that he's hiding in the ruins out on the east road. Now listen. I want all of you to get out there- immediately. And I will get some civilian volunteers in to help you in this search for him. That's it, get moving. Sir. This way. Right, Kaplan. This is the police. We know you're in there. We got you surrounded. I'll give you five minutes to come out- or we'll come right in there and get you out ourselves. - Alright, let's go in and take him. - Right. Quick, spread out. Hey, let's go this way. Hey, he's hurt. He's heading into the jungle. - Charlie? - Yeah? He's heading for the jungle, we're going in after him. We'll need your backup. Let's go. Let's go. Hey, he's over there. Get down! Let's go, men. Let's go. Spread out! No, not me. I didn't mean it, please. Spare me. Come on. There he is. Come on, move it. Hey, Charlie. Over there. - Go check it out. - Right. Damn. Charlie. Yeah? How's the situation there? It's not good. I've lost some of my men- and I really don't have enough people to handle this situation. This guy is too good for us. We need a special unit. Let's quit now. We'll get some more reinforcements. I know that. Jack is wounded. He can't go far- and he must be somewhere in the jungle. I remember, there's a cave out there. But I forget the location. I know that you are familiar with the area. That's the only place he can hide. I'll double your price. Half up-front and half on delivery. Get right on it, and use one of my horses. - Hold it. - Stop. What are you doing here? I'm here to collect from Duffy for this. Close the door. You wait there, don't move. What is it? That guy is really Jack. You give me a gun. Alert all the guards around the house. That fucking bastard. He won't get away from this place in one piece. Get going. Alright Jack, it's all over. It's the end of the road for you. Just why did you kill my wife? Why? Why? It's because of you, you bastard. I loved her. I gave her everything but she didn't want me. It was always 'Jack did this' and 'Jack did that'. Even when we thought you were dead. She was always comparing me to you. So when I knew you were coming back- I killed her. If I couldn't have her, at least I knew- that by killing her I would be making damn sure- you couldn't have her either. Shit. Get him. Don't let him escape. Damn.
