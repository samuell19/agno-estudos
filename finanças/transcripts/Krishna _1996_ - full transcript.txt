My anklets tinkled My veil slipped from my head The way he looked into my eyes My eyes lowered demurely The incident of our first meeting was strange My heart was fluttering For a moment l thought My heartbeat had stopped My anklets tinkled... l met his eyes in the middle of the street l lost my heart with that one look l kept turning back and looking at him l myself was bewildered My anklets tinkled... lt is three years now. Wonder where you have disappeared. Come back, Sunil. Wherever you are, come back. Warden, fill this lad's plate first. He has to give me a massage after he finishes his meal. Okay, sir. Go lad, eat to your fill. And then come quickly to my room. Go, kid. Jailer, you only have made the rules. The one who is standing first in queue will get the food first. And l am the first in queue today. How dare you argue with me! Do you have the guts to meet my eyes? Hereafter, if anyone dares to raise his voice against me ... ... he will meet a similar fate. Did you all hear me? Jailer, l forgot to say something. You will tire beating me ... ... but l will not tire getting beaten. Until my feet have the strength to help me stand ... ... l will continue to bounce back. No power in the world can stop me from filling my plate. Prisoner number 212, you are being released. You have been called in the jailer's office. Move your hands faster. You move your hands like a girl. Sir, l only have two hands. How can l do work of 10-12 men single-handedly? Come on, work! These guys take leave when business is at peak. Who will handle the porters when they come from the port? My father? Answer me! - l will handle them, sir. - Who are you? - Can l get a job? - Of course! Take this broom and sweep the hotel clean. What about salary? You'll get food to fill your stomach ... ... and money to fill your pocket. Greetings, Rajabhai. l understand. You want breakfast. You'll get it. Hey boy, serve this table. Are you blind? Look it's not my fault. His hand hit the tray and... Give sir, l'll clean it. Don't touch it. Do you know how much this coat cost? You will work hard all your life ... ... yet you won't be able to pay even the stitching charges. The bastard! l didn't know you needed two men to help you abuse. Or what would you do? Ask your men to leave me. Then watch for yourself. Leave him. - Hello, inspector. - Hello. Come in and have tea. You seem to be hot headed. You haven't seen my temper yet. Just touch me, and l'll burn you to cinders. This is my address. lf you think you are brave, come here at sharp 4 O'clock. l'll cool your hot head. Keep looking at your watch. Fearing me, your watch may stop ticking. Hey! have you come here to work or throw your weight around? Go away. lf you stay here for even 10 minutes ... ... my hotel will be smashed. l will be ruined. - Please leave. - Pay me my dues. Here's your money. You said you will fill my pockets. lnspector! What is it? Your wallet. Keep this. l don't take money l don't deserve. And don't give up money l have earned. - Pack well. - Yes, sir. - You? - Look at your watch, sir. l have come before time. You made a mistake in entering the lion's den. You will die a rat's death. Only a dare devil can dare to enter a lion's den, not a rat. Beware! This is between us two, no one will interfere. l forgot to tell you something. You will tire beating me. But l will not tire getting beaten. l don't tire until my enemy tires. Like you have got tired. Now....it's my turn. Let's shake hands. l really am pleased to meet you. What work do you do? l lost my job because of you today morning. l am looking for a job now. What work can you do? The work that nobody else can. Come with me. Take this car to Francis' garage in Byculla. Keys? ln our business, a lock is not opened using keys ... ... but by using brains. Try. Like you forgot to tell me something ... ... likewise, even l forgot to tell you something. The car you are travelling in ... ... is a stolen one. Don't be shocked, Krishna. Because you'll suffer many shocks ahead. lt will be a bit of a trouble, ... ... but turn and look under the back seat. This man passed on information about us to the police. So we passed him out of this world. But regretfully, the police has come to know of this murder. Look into the rear view mirror of your car. A police jeep is following you. Usman, that smart ass must be getting beaten ... ... by the police right now. He must be pleading with the police ... ... and telling them he doesn't know anything about the corpse. That he didn't commit the murder. He was trying to mess with Rajabhai. He must be ruing over his fate. Over why he made this mistake. Why he messed with Rajabhai. l know l have got the job. And also this flat. This flat is now yours. Groom yourself. When l present myself tomorrow, you won't be able to recognise me. Sir, this man... What is he? He is a diamond who will make my fate shine. He will take me to heights l always dreamed of. Rest assured, the minister is fine. How did this happen? Sir, the minister's car was moving on VP Road ... ..when a motorcycle came speeding out of a building compound. lt came and stood near the minister's car. Only one man was on the bike. Then what happened? Before the commandos could do anything ... ... that man started firing. Both the commandos died on the spot. Thankfully, the bullet hit the minister's shoulder. - Was that man caught? - No, he disappeared somewhere. We have put up checks at every exit point. The killer cannot escape Keep a watch on the domestic and international airports too. And look, arrest anyone you suspect. lt is true that whenever man treads the path of truth ... ... he has to face such hardships. This has not happened the first time, it has happened before. Nails were hammered into Jesus Christ when he was alive. But what happened ultimately? Who won? Truth! This is my answer to all those who have accused ... ... that it is not me, but the underworld who runs this state. l ask all of you. lf the underworld was hand in glove with me ... ... why would it try to eliminate me? Why did it have to shoot me? Those Dons, those goons, are not my friends, but my enemies. They are the enemies of people. Even those Dons must be hearing my challenge on TV. l want to tell them... We are full of patriotism Let us see how strong the enemy is He's a good orator. - Hey Fokat. (free loader) - Wait a minute. My name is Popat, why do you call me Fokat? Because you are worthless. Come on! Come Raghav. Hello. Here's your reward. You hit right on target. l don't understand. When l could have shot the minister in the chest ... ... why did you ask me to shoot him in the shoulder? lf you had shot him in the chest, he would have died. Become a martyr. Of what use would he be to us then? With being shot in the shoulder, he now lives in fear. He will gradually bow before us. He will be a minister for the world ... ... but we will rule! Constable, check the dicky. Check that car too. What's in your car? Where is that car going? Stop it. - Oh, it's you. - What is the matter? Looks like this time you got the wallet, but didn't return it. Why did you stop me? Was l speeding? Not the car, but your speed is pretty fast. You were zero in the morning. By evening, you are a hero? From a waiter to a car owner, you traversed the distance quite fast. Those who have a strong will power ... ... can even bring down the sky. Those who look at the sky @ walk, l have often seen them falling. 'The brave fall in a battlefield' 'Those who walk on their knees, their fall doesn't matter' Nice couplet. Switch on your tail lights, or someone will bang you from behind. - Fill up the tank. - Okay, sir. Move. Sunil, stop! lt's three years since l have been waiting for you. And today when l met you, you are turning away and leaving? - You are telling me? - Yes, l am telling you. - Look miss... - Sunil, why are you... l am your Rashmi, Sunil. Who is she talking to? Sunil, you? Look at him. l don't know why he is refusing to recognise me. Hero, stop acting. You have made her suffer enough. Please stop it now. What nonsense is this? You are piling on. lt was you who had piled on us. Forgot the Rajasthan fair ... ... where you had sung a song with Rashmi? Song? Look, l am sure there is some misunderstanding. My name is not Sunil, l am Krishna. lf you are not my Sunil, show me the hand on which you had ... ... got my name tattooed. Not the left, the right hand. You really are not my Sunil. Because my Sunil would chop off his hand ... ... would eliminate his body ... ... but would never let my name be erased from his hand. Pardon me. - How much for these anklets? - They cost Rs 300. - But you cannot buy them. - Why? Because someone has already bought them. - What is in this? - See for yourself. Okay. These are those same anklets. 'These are ordinary anklets' 'Just tell me, l'll even bring down the moon at your feet' 'Your lover, Pilot' Who gave you these? He's not there? Tell me, where is he? Rashmi, this Pilot has become crazy about you. Take. Why are you looking here and there. Wear them. He'll hear the tinkle and get drawn to you. Her anklets tinkled Even her veil slipped from her head When l met her eyes Her eyes lowered demurely l met her eyes in the middle of the street l lost my heart with that one look l kept turning back and looking at her l myself was bewildered Her anklets tinkled... The incident of our first meeting was strange My heart was fluttering For a moment l thought My heartbeat had stopped Her anklets tinkled... Two minutes, sir. Please. She must be on her way. - You are very late. - l was talking to God. Our talks extended. What did you ask from God? - Your happiness. - And for yourself? ln your happiness lies mine. For you. When l return as a trained pilot, fix it on my jacket. Coming, sir. Rashmi, l am going. Krishna, the man we are going to meet ... ... is a king in drug dealings. People know him as Bhau. But his real name is Bhujangrao. Here's your quota. Pay for it and leave! l don't want 1 kg today, l want 10 kgs. l have even brought the money. The demand is increasing. And then, everyone wants his business to grow. Even l want to be a rich man. You started with 50 gms, and want to jump to 10 kgs now? But it is not your fault. This city is to be blamed. This city is a city in name only. lt is actually a jungle. One animal kills another to survive here. lt is the norm here. lf you want to grow, cut the other to size. Who are you planning to cut to size? Me? - Me? - No. lt is not necessary that you have to cut another to size to grow. There is no other way. lf there is, tell me about it. - This is a line. - Yes, so? l will not even touch it @ still become bigger than this. Like this. Aren't l bigger? You are a smart guy. He's got zing. You can become eminent. You can. But not with him. His name only coincidentally happens to be Raja (king). His name should have been Bikhari (beggar). Got angry, huh? So what will you do? Tell me. Will you beat me? Will you? The beat me. Beat! With the other hand too. Beat me. You want to become eminent, don't you? You want to, don't you? You can. You can become eminent. All this can be yours. All of it. But you'll have to play a game for it. - Game? - Yes, game. l will extend my palms like this. And you will hit them like this. Come on, it's your turn first. lf you manage to hit ... ... all the packets will be yours. Why are you looking over there? Look here. Come on, it's your turn first. l'll extend my palm, you hit. Come on, hit. He missed it. You couldn't. Now you'll have to pay penalty. No! Stand there! Don't move. Don't move. This is a game between us. Now it is my turn. l will hit. Extend your palm. Come on! Now l will hit. l didn't even start and you moved your hand? Now you will get 20kgs. Come on, extend your palm. l won again. lt's my turn again. Raja, your state is worst than a beggar. You cannot even extend your palm to beg. lf you want to be big, learn to make your hand big. Then come to me to beg. Wants 10 kgs indeed! Get lost! Hey....go. What are you thinking? Without myself losing anything, l want everything! l want that rascal Bhujangrao's chair. You will get it. But before that it is necessary to settle scores ... ... for every wound that he has inflicted on you. l promise you l will take revenge. Rajabhai, call for you. Sir, l have a white horse. Want it? Who is this? You only ride the horse, why bother about anything else? - How much do you have? - 10 packets. - When can l get it? - Next Monday. Good day. Krishna, do you know whose call that was? l do. First you got your hands broken. Now you are going to get your legs broken. What do you mean? When you have a fifth ace instead of four in a pack of cards ... ... realise that something is fishy. lt is better that you forget the telephone conversation. You are new in this game. And l have been playing it even before l was born. This was not a call, it was a message. The beggar's days are over now. Raja! You are really going to be king now! Krishna, you had seen these hands being broken. Now watch how l break Bhujangrao's spine. - White horse. - The stable is okay. Come....sit down. Where is the stuff? First give me money. l first take the material then pay for it. l take money first. l take money, and also not give the material. Where is the money? He's one up on you. Tell me, or l will blow off your brains. Sir....not you, that man with long hair. Sir, you brought my bag and l brought yours. All my important papers are in this bag, sir. The income tax authorities have attached my properties. Thank you, sir. l'll take your leave. Thank you, sir. l am leaving. Open the bag. - Tell me. - Bhai, the job is done. We didn't give him anything, and even brought his money. Well done, Pandu. Look, l don't want that money. Enjoy that money. Thank you, Bhai. God bless you. Good day. - But what about your life? - Who is it? l have come to take your life and my money. ls it? Then try it. Don't test me. lf you will listen, l have a suggestion. Tell me. Pacing the floor is not going to help. Accept that there is a man one up on you. You wanted to loot Raja's money and ruin him. He looted your money and ruined you. This has not been done by Raja, but Krishna. Then why don't you join hands with Krishna? You will not be able to win against him. This Krishna is not God, he is an ordinary man. lf l come across him again, l'll powder him to dust! Who is this? God! See Fokat, he his himself walking to his grave. You are making a mistake again. He is not walking to his grave, he is ringing your death knell. Shut-up! Bhujangrao, in this world of cheating ... ... there are certain honest rules. But you broke those rules and tried to loot Rajabhai's money. But we turned out to be one up on you. Along with your money, we even looted your material. Which l have come to return to you. Bhujangrao, all this can be yours. But you will have to play a game for it. - Game? - Yes. The same game you have been playing everyday since childhood. lf you win, all these packets will be yours. Come on, it is your turn first. Come on, hit. Hit! Missed? Now you will have to pay penalty. Like this. Hey, don't move! This game is between us. Remove your hand. Come on, get up! Come. lt is my turn now. Extend your palm. Now l will hit. l did not even hit, and you moved your hand? Hey Bhujang, your state is worst than that of a beggar. You cannot even extend your palm and beg. You only had said, to become big, learn to make your hands big. Look. Can you see? See how big my hands have become. Look....look. These big hands are putting alms in your palm. You are no ordinary girl. You are Marilyn Monroe. You have balmed my wounds, friend. You have cooled my raging heart. We have found the girl we were looking for. When she will dance in the hotel, she'll set everyone's heart afire. The world will go crazy. Your find is really interesting. But today, you will not make the city go crazy,but only my friend. Because the credit for whatever l am today, goes to him. Make tonight, an alluring night. What is your name? Mischief What do you do? Mischief What is your message? Mischief Your greeting? Mischief What's in your eyes? Mischief What's on your lips Mischief What's in your tresses Mischief What's in your gait Mischief, mischief, mischief... There is mischief in me always l am full of mischief The heart pounds on seeing you That is why the world is crazy about you The college guys say, hello, hi, mischief! The bus and taxi drivers say, mischief, stop! My heart wants mischief l don't have time, my love Meet my eyes l don't get trapped so easily l don't come cheap There is mischief in me always ... 1 , 2, 3, my heart went toing! What a look, what a smile, my heart went boing! Give me your heart's diary Write my name and address on it l am a simple, innocent man l accept you are fair and l am dark l have been saving my heart for you No, l cannot wait l am a decent girl l am so beautiful, see my mischief What do l do, everyone loves me! l am full of mischief... What's in your beauty? Mischief What's in your complexion? Mischief What's in your style? Mischief What's in your loyalty? Mischief What's in your attitude? Mischief What's in your voice? Mischief What's in your sight? Mischief What is waiting for you? Mischief, mischief, mischief .... There is mischief in me always... You are full of mischief Hey mister, will you leave, or do l call the hotel owner? Owner? l can even become a slave for you, darling. Just let me taste those intoxicating lips once. Leave me! Where are you running? How far can you run? - l will not let you go today. - Go away! Go away! Let me go, or l will scream! l will kiss you! Leave me. You hit me? l have just hit you now. Next time you even look at this girl... ... l'll kill you! Why did you beat him? How are you related to me? Even if he looked at me, why did you feel offended? This body is mine, these lips are mine. Their softness is also mine. l can let anyone kiss me. Who are you to interfere in my personal life? lf you were my Sunil ... ... you would have that right. But you mean nothing to me. Get out of here. Sunil, why don't you say that you are my Sunil? Sir, someone has left this packet for you. Keep it. You like shooting a man dead, don't you? Take this money, and pump as many bullets you have in your gun ... ... into Krishna. Assume your job is done. Rashmi, your life is in danger. Open the door! First tell me whether you are my Sunil or not. Finish the girl too. First tell me whether you are my Sunil or not. Say that you are my Sunil. Rashmi, listen to me! Try and understand. They will kill you. Kill them! Ensure they don't escape. Rashmi, stop the car. Open the door. - Tell me, aren't you my Sunil? - l am not your Sunil. Rashmi, don't be stupid. Rashmi, stop! l am your Sunil. Did you hear that? l am your Sunil, Rashmi. Rashmi, neither was l a betrayer ... ... nor my love. lf anyone was a betrayer, it was my time. l still remember that day when l was going for my last test flight. But our track is 195, sir. Just follow my orders. This route goes to the border, sir. On the pretext of a final test, ... ... my instructor asked me to land at the wrong place. Suddenly, some cars came towards our plane. l realized that this entire mission involved smuggling. When l protested, they made me unconscious. When l regained consciousness, l saw my instructor ... ... saving himself from commando bullets ... ... and coming towards the plane. l used all my might to make his evil mission fail. Suddenly, my instructor was shot dead. When l turned around, l saw the murderer escaping in a white car. Before l could gather myself, the police surrounded me. They thought even l was a smuggler. l tried my best to prove l was innocent. But because of lack of evidence, l was sentenced for seven years. ln jail, l was told that a law protector has come to meet me. My name is DCP Khanna. You will have to come with me. Don't worry, l won't push you to death's door. Who is afraid of death? l have begun to fear life. Then come with me, you will love life. Before time, as usual. Minister? The DCP has shown me your file, Sunil. And l have even read what was not written in it. You are a pawn in the game of time... ... who himself did not make any move ... ... yet was defeated. My instinct says you are innocent. But my believing you to be innocent ... ... doesn't make you innocent in the eyes of law. So you will have to come out of jail ... ... and erase this stigma on you. You are wondering why l am doing you this favour? A politician never does anyone a favour. So even l am not doing you any favour. But l want to use you as my weapon to target the fish eye. Fish eye? There are many fish in the sea of crime. But there is one fish who l know very well. Which has eaten many small fish and become big. lf we manage to trap that fish ... ... l can clean up the sea of crime l don't understand, sir. This lndian city of Bombay ... ... which people considered a heaven of peace and brotherhood... ... on 12th March 1993, was turned to hell. The city was devastated. Friends became enemies. Those who could die for each other ... ... became thirsty for each other's blood. Humans lost their humanity and behaved like animals. Sowing the seeds of hatred among brothers is none other ... ... than our neighbouring country ... ... who, to spread unrest in our country ... ... sent RDx, AK56, AK47, arms, ammunitions, weapons, here. They succeeded only because some of our country's traitors ... ... were hand in glove with them. His name tops the list of traitors. Raja, alias Fakirchand. He has been into drug dealing since childhood. The man who supplies him drugs is Bhujangrao. The whole underworld knows him as Bhai. Even Bhai has a boss, Kubra. Sir, he is the same man who... l know. Kubra was doing the drug deal, but you got trapped. This rascal was born in lndia ... ... but sold his soul to our enemy country. This traitor has been putting our country's security at stake ... ... and strengthening the enemy's hands. You have to reach this man. He's the fish eye! To reach your goal, you will have to take help of this ladder. First Raja, then Bhujangrao, and then, Kubra. To reach these criminals, you will have to become a criminal. You will have to buy drugs, you will have to sell drugs. You may also have to commit murders. You will have to do everything that even a professional doesn't. But what about my mother and sister? We have put together a story for them. You are going to London for training in flying. Your salary will be sent to your mother every month. From today, your mother is our responsibility. But remember one thing, until our mission is over ... ... you neither have a mother, nor a sister. You will even have to erase your lover's name from your hand. lf you succeed in this mission ... ... this country, this land, will forever be obligated to you. For having saved the country from being ruined. l promise you sir, even if l come across my mother ... ... in this mission, l will ignore her and proceed. lf my sister holds me back, l will break ties with her. That leaves my love. A man who can forget his mother and sister ... ... his lover is inconsequential in comparison. The way Lord Krishna had come down on earth to kill the evil Kans... ... likewise, to eliminate these criminals ... ... you will have to become Krishna. You will have to pick a gun. That is why this operation has been named Operation Krishna. So from today, the man named Sunil is dead. And Krishna has been born. Let the enemies of humanity and traitors of the country know ... ... that Krishna has declared war. l had only one way to prove myself innocent. That l become Krishna from Sunil. Which l did. My lover's name was erased from my hand. An innocent man was made a demon and sent into the crime world. Now this is my world, Rashmi. Until l finish all these dealers of poison who deal in death ... ... l cannot get out of here. Rashmi, my life has been ruined. Why do you want to ruin your life? Return back to your world. Go back. Sunil, you erased my name from your hand. But how do l erase your name which is imprinted on my heart? Now we will live together, and die together. The night came, the moon rose The moon rose, the stars shone The stars shone, we fell in love How can anyone conceal love Eyes meet and the feet falter Love has had such an effect on me l am unaware of myself The state of the heart is strange You have started giving dreams to my eyes Don't look at me with a smile l will steal you into my heart Your touch has made my breath fragrant My eyes close with coyness Your style casts a magic spell Eyes meet and the feet falter... l'll not be able to spend my life alone Give me the favour of your love My heart soars to the skies These moments of love are so beautiful Lamps of new desires are being lit Without any string, we are being drawn towards each other l am being drawn to you You smile in the window of my heart Eyes meet and the feet falter... Why did you stop the car here? Who is this girl? l had told you beforehand... Don't worry, sir. You can trust Rashmi ... ... as much as you trust me. How is my mother, sir? Look, l had told you that you cannot meet anyone ... ... until Operation Krishna is over. But today, not as a police officer ... ... but in the capacity of a fellow human being ... ... l am asking you to go and meet your mother. What is the matter, sir? ls mother all right? A mother who has only one son, @ if even he is away from her... ... how can she be all right? l'll go and meet mother today itself. Who is it? Sunil, is it you? What is it? Dreamt of your son again? No, Sunil had come just now. Madam, earlier, you dreamt while sleeping. Now you have started dreaming even when awake. No one has come here. Go back to sleep. l heard his footsteps. Go back to sleep. God! Today's kids don't care for their parents. 'Dear mother, you did good all your life ...' '... and l am enjoying the fruits' 'You didn't understand? l have got an angel of a husband' 'He cares so much for me ...' '... that many a times, l start crying with happiness' 'Mother, l have good news' 'You are going to be a grandma' 'Tell brother that my husband wants him to name our baby' 'Take care of yourself, and take your medicines on time' 'Give my love to Sakhubai, and tell her not to leave you alone' 'Your loving daughter, Sudha.' The groom will come He will bring the wedding procession to your door He will take you away in a palanquin Your brother will be left singing and smiling The groom will come.... We will dance We will sing What a day that will be When you will be a bride These streets, these squares, will remind us of you Without you, they will all torment me But for your happiness, l will forget my sorrow l will light up the whole house myself My heart, my soul, my life ln your happiness lies mine What a day that will be When you will be a bride My heart will cry, yet l will sing and dance The groom will bring the wedding procession to your door Your brother will be left singing and smiling The groom will come... She is my life's dream, my love The fate of my love in your hands now The one's whose beautiful face l adore l am now handing over that darling sister to you You are a symbol of loyalty, of love Your duty is to serve, you are a woman That day has come You are now a bride This brother of yours will even put his life at stake for you The groom will bring the wedding procession to your door Your brother will be left singing and smiling - Mom. - My son. When did you come? A while ago. Come, sit close to me. Mom. Where do you leave me in this old age and go away, son? What can l do? My work is such. But mom, the next time l come ... ... l will never leave you and go. You mean you are going to go away again? l will have to go. My work is not over yet. Go son, but return soon. lt shouldn't happen that my eyes keep waiting ... ... and my breath deserts me. No mom, don't talk like that. l will return soon. Very soon. - l will go with you. - Why? - Your life is in danger. - Look, l don't need security. l don't have any enemies. l know dear, but the minister has many enemies, so ... Uncle, you too? - What happened to my daughter? - Look what DCP uncle is saying. His men will follow me like a tail? DCP, you are putting tabs on my daughter's freedom too now. l am helpless, sir. As per intelligence reports, ... ... the terrorists who had made an attempt on your life ... ... are not sitting quiet. They are waiting for an opportunity ... ... to get you out of the way. To weaken your resolve, they can even harm your family. The DCP is right. Serving the public, even if l lose my life ... ... l won't regret it. But if anything happens to you, ... ... l will never be able to forgive myself. So do what the DCP is saying. lt is in everyone's interest. Hey! Come down quickly. What is the matter, Raja? You seem to be in a hurry. - l have great news. - What news? Get into the car. What l was looking for has itself walked up to me. l don't understand. - Who is Kubra? - The Don of the underworld. The boss of Bhujangrao. l wanted to meet him since a very long time. But that rascal Bhujangrao ... ... never let me reach him. Today, he has himself called me. Do you understand the meaning of meeting Kubra? Meeting Kubra means reaching close to your destination. Not you Raja, l am reaching close to my destination. Bhujangrao, even if you don't let me, l will say this. Seeing Raja here, l feel your position is in trouble. Shut-up! Or l'll make you dumb! Think something fast. That Kubra is going to disgrace you. He was Kubra's right hand man. Even he was killed?!! Come. l have nothing. - You stay here. - Thank you. l didn't want to enter the death trap anyway. Hello, Kubra. You fixed our meeting after a very long time. How was your trip to Switzerland? Come, Raja. l feel very happy to see the rising sun. Come, take your chair. But Kubra, usually l used to sit... You used to sit. But now, Raja will occupy that chair. Until now, Raja used to take the drug supply from you. Now, you will take the drugs from Raja. Several. Who suffers a loss with you two fighting? Me, only me. Whenever Raja tried to progress ... ... you always tried to put him down. But he turned out to be a brave man. He put you down and proved himself one up on you. Well done, Raja, well done. Our business needs courageous men like you. Only you deserve to be in this chair. Kubra, it's my friend Krishna who deserves to be in this chair ... ... not me. lf he had not supported me, l wouldn't have reached here. Really? Where is he? Raja just told me that you are in a big way responsible ... ... for his success. l am pleased to meet you. You were a delicate bud, reared with love You have demureness in your eyes, and a smile on your lips ln your parents house, you were away from all sorrow You were everyone's darling You were treated like a princess You had no sorrow, you swung with happiness You used to sing and laugh You were so full of life What l was What l was, and what l have become l have become a punishment for myself What do l tell you what tortures l suffered lf anyone writes about it, even the pen will drip tears All those cruel men are present in this party Who ruined my innocent life They laugh at my tears They torture me to make me dance l hope there is never a married woman like me l hope there is no bride as unfortunate as me l became... l became a bride and lost all my dignity l have become a punishment for myself... Gafoor, call the municipality. Ask them to come and pick up the garbage. 'lf my sister holds me back, l will break ties with her' l had thought you are very happy, sister What fire was this that burnt you to cinders You hid your tears from us You made me believe you were happy, so that l don't cry You were a symbol of loyalty, of love Your duty was to serve, you were a woman What a day that was When you became a bride Don't touch this sacred ash. You people mauled her body every night.Let her sleep in peace now. You people love to see nude bodies. Go and bid in the flesh market. You will get another Sudha to warm your bed. The one who you think bought Sudha, is her brother. He cannot be her brother. lf he was her brother,he wouldn't have sold her to that cruel man. She lived her tormenting life ... ...but always wrote to her brother @ mother that she was very happy. And that her husband is an angel. - You mean, Karan.... - Yes Karan. Who sold not only Sudha, but many other innocent girls like her. Even l am one among those unfortunate ones. Sunil, forgive me. Please forgive me. Please forgive me, l made a grave mistake. No! Never! lf l forgive you ... ... my sister, Sudha will never forgive me, you rascal! l will beg at Sudha's feet and ask for forgiveness. She is very nice. She will forgive me. Please, Sunil! She can never forgive you now. l have just cremated her. With these hands. With these very hands! You gave her such a filthy life, that she committed suicide. The scream of her death is still ringing my in ears. And until l hear a more terrifying scream from you ... ... l will not be able to live in peace. No! Sunil, please forgive me. l am scared of heights. Please forgive me. l am scared of heights. You want to kill Karan? Take. Pump all six bullets into him. But how will that help? Will you get back your sister? Will she come alive? Nothing of the sort will happen. lnstead, you will reach back where l had released you from. Behind bars. Karan is a small pawn in this dirty game. You have to reach the mastermind behind this game. So keep your emotions in control. And move only towards your goal. Sir, l have bad news. Your daughter has been kidnapped. Her bodyguard was killed. The terrorists say that if Karan is not released within an hour... ... they will kill your daughter. Let them kill my daughter. Let them feed her to vultures. But that scoundrel Karan will not be released at any cost! You want me to release that animal who tortured his sister? l could not save his sister, but l'll not spare that bastard. Even if they kill my entire family. The government has requested the public ... ... to use electricity sparingly. We have just received news ... ... that minister Amar Prabhakar's daughter has been kidnapped. And her bodyguard was killed. The kidnappers have demanded the release of their colleague .. ... who is in police custody. His name is Karan. As per a report, the police had arrested him last night. He is a member of a gang who used to marry innocent girls ... ... and then push them into the flesh trade. And now, the sports news. See how she is craving for her son. Just let her son see his mother once. Say something. l think the call is for you. lf it rings again, you take it. l'm not taking it. Sir!...Sir! She's ... Take one more. Bhujang here. Give the phone to Raja. Bhujangrao for you. - Yes? - Can l get some supplies? - How much do you want? - 10 kgs. - When do you want it? - As soon as you can give. All right, come to the railway yard at sharp.....10 O'clock. All right. Just come! Be ready. lt's time for the prey to come. The moment Raja opens his bag, pump bullets into him. Why Raja, hasn't your partner, Krishna come with you today? Talk business. Have you brought the money? Khote, shoot. Khote, why aren't you shooting? Khote, shoot! Shoot you bastard! l had warned you, Raja. Bhujangrao cheated us again today. You tried to backstab me again! l will not spare you! - Raja, forgive me. - Forgive you? Forgive you? You used to play games with these hands. Come on, play! Play! - Look, l killed this bastard. - Raja, come! Let's leave before then police arrives. Come to your senses! Let's go! Hurry! Rashmi, hurry! Move! Come. May the soul rest in peace. See the rush outside. Probably a cop's mother has died. lt's her death procession. 'Even if l come across my mother in this mission of death ...' '... l will ignore her and proceed' You did good. You did right in killing Bhujangrao. One has to kill. When one wants to move ahead in this business ... ... one has to remove the hurdles in his way of progress. You two have gained by killing Bhujangrao. But who will pay for the loss l have suffered? You will pay. You will pay. Both of you will reimburse my loss. What loss? - 70 million. - What 70 million? Bhujangrao had taken 70 million from me. A loan. Before l could recover my money, you two killed him. Who will make that payment to me now? You will pay. Both of you will make that payment to me. That too, within 24 hours. Until then, this sexy girl will remain in my custody. This too. Go...go quickly. Time doesn't wait for anybody. l have suffered enough, sir. Even Krishna must not lost as much in Mahabharat,... ... as l have, masquerading as Krishna. Now l am wondering if jail was better than this life ... ... which you have given me. lf l was in jail, l wouldn't do ... ... all that you have forced me to do. Have you seen these hands? They never killed even an ant. You forced them to kill men. l sold drugs. God knows how many lives you forced me to ruin. l used to think that God wrote everyone's destinies. But you wrote my destiny. That too, not in ink, but in blood. Right before my eyes, men molested my sister. lf l wanted, l could have ripped off their hands! But l was helpless. Because of you. Because of your Operation Krishna. My sister committed suicide right before my eyes. And l could not even try to save her. l had promised mom l will come back. Will return back to her. Forget returning back to her, l could not even be her pallbearer. l could not even hug her the last time and cry. My last hope of survival was Rashmi. Even her life is at stake. Kubra has valued her life at 70 million. Where will l bring 70 million from? - Who will give me 70 million? - l will! lf you think Kubra will return your love to you ... ... against this money ... ... then you don't know Kubra. He is like a chameleon who can change colours any time. So be careful. Come, Krishna. l knew you would come to get your lover released. But didn't know you'd manage to bring 70 million for her so soon. You have never loved, Kubra. For Rashmi, forget 70 million, ... ... even if you had asked for 700 million ... ... l'd throw it at your face! l have kept my promise. Now you keep yours. What is the hurry, Krishna? l have fulfilled my promise. But you have to answer some of my questions. What questions? 19th August....yes, 19th August. On 19th August 1993, a pilot named Sunil ... He was sentenced for seven years. He had been sent to Tihar jail. What do you know about that Sunil? Who Sunil? After a few days, before his sentence was over ... ... someone got that Sunil released from jail. And that same Sunil was used to reach me. That day, Sunil died, and Krishna was born. You must be knowing that Krishna. l don't know any such Krishna. l'll tell you. The minister Prabhakar made you Krishna from Sunil. He gave you 70 million ... ... so that you could reach where no one could until now. Don't beat him. Now l will tell you. You were made Krishna so that you could get this key. Behind which that minister's destiny is locked. Say that you are the Sunil who was made Krishna. Admit it! No! Leave! Admit you are that Sunil who was made Krishna. Admit it! You know everything about me, Kubra. But didn't come to know ... ... that Krishna doesn't tire getting beaten ... ... until his enemy tires beating him. Like you have got tired. Now it is my turn. l just heard firing. lt is true that my name is not Krishna. l am Sunil. lt is true that the minister got me released from jail. He only made me Krishna from Sunil. l became Krishna from Sunil ... ... so that l could reach you and prove myself innocent. You bastard! l'd have chopped your hands that very day ... ... when you touched my sister. But l was helpless that day. l am not helpless today, Kubra. l am not helpless! l am not helpless, Kubra! Look inspector, l'll explain everything... No! What have you done, Raja! l am calling from Liberty towers, gate 3. Hurry! Have you gone mad, Krishna? What have you done? - Forget him. Let's go! Hurry! - You'll be fine, inspector. - Let's go, Krishna! - No! What is wrong with you? Why are you trying to save an inspector's life? Krishna, we have millions of rupees. And you are clinging to a corpse? Leave him! He is not a corpse. And l have to save him. Leave this corpse. Raja, move! l will save him. An inspector has come between our friendship today? Have you forgotten that the police is our enemy? They only deserve to die at our hands. And you want to save his life? Now save him! Krishna, if you want to spend your life with this corpse ... ... then fine! l am leaving. Raja, l am not a police officer. But l am an officer of law ... ... who doesn't wear a uniform ... ... but puts the wreath of death on a criminal. You were made Krishna from Sunil so that you could get hold this key. Behind which is locked the minister's destiny. That bastard's! Let go! Stay there! Where are you running? - Let me go! Don't! Spare me! Help! What makes you laugh like that, Daddy? Have you gone mad? l'm not mad, my dear. l'm laughing at those mad men... who are called Hindustanis. They were eulogising me as if l were their God. How are they to know that l'm a venomous snake in a human garb? My child, you need not hide anymore. Because, those fools believe that my foes really kidnapped you. Using force doesn't help win over the lndians. Only tears can win them over. But, what when the people find out that my kidnapping was just a farce? That day will never come, my dear. That day is here, Prabhakar. You take us lndians for fools, don't you? Lost your tongue now, eh? Holler about! Go on! - Behave yourself, Deputy! l'm the Chief Minister. l will be taking the oath tomorrow. Not you, the people will take an oath to shoot traitors like you in public! Deputy, why must you invite your death? Join me. l'll make your life. Think about yourself, Prabhakar. Right now, your life is at the mercy of my gun! Hey, don't shoot! Stupid Hindustani! Long live Amar Prabhakar! Long live Amar Prabhakar! And now, l invite Mr Prabhakar to come up and swear in as the Chief Minister. l, Amar Prabhakar, take an oath that... for my country... and for the constitution of my country... with the utmost resolve... shall discharge the duties of the Chief Minister. Bastard! Where will you run? l won't spare you! l'll kill you! Bastard! Traitor! You will run, eh? Lay off! Bloody hypocrite! Traitor! Stop bastard! Fraud! To save the righteous... to destroy evil... for the establishment of truth... l shall incarnate Myself in every age
