BASED ON THE NOVEL BY ROGER BORNICHE It's always like this on Fridays. We must have ten minute breaks between each group. Otherwise, people get mixed up and go to the wrong funeral. Get in while we're waiting, if you want. - No thanks. - As you wish. We must still wait. You can go, if you like. I won't say no! Thanks, I've another two processions after this. I cannot speak of Albert Malaggione without mentioning his hometown first. Located in Corsica, - at Santa Dulia de Porto- - Vecchio, it's a beautiful village by the sea where Albert and his brother grew up, poor but happy. Albert, whoever who murdered you spinelessly will not go unpunished. The place you're going is en route. Don't worry, it's no trouble to drive you. I don't mind taking the bus. You'll have to wait a long time: the bus drivers are on strike. Even the 152? Yeah, like the rest. Are you coming? Hurry up, it's raining. They've been on strike two days. Do you not read the papers? No, I'm currently reading Marguerite Yourcenar. Mishima, A Vision of the Void. Do you not like it? Well, movies are more my thing really. Images give you a better picture. My aunt would go to the movies occasionally too. Was that your aunt? - And you? - It was someone... um, I never saw him or knew him. Do you go to the funerals of people who mean nothing to you? I was there to represent my boss. What do you do? I'm in finance, in business... May I invite you out for lunch? - Why? - It would be a pleasure to do so. - What was your aunt called? - Eugénie. I only knew her in Paris. When I say that I knew her, I hadn't known her for that long. She died eight days after I arrived. One night she suffocated, then she fell in a coma. She was said to be rich... She mainly left debts behind, and some furniture I'll try to sell. Well, this isn't very cheerful! And before? Before all this? Everything was ugly beforehand. I was an au pair with very proper people. I was the perfect creature who could speak to the son formally, without laughing. An 11-year-old idiot who would spy through my bedroom keyhole. In the afternoons, we'd look after the plants with Madame, we'd crush slates so that the pink hydrangeas would turn blue. And in the evenings, I'd be the fourth player at bridge whenever they invited someone famous over for dinner... I played this game for four years... in Bourges. From the gentleman over there. It's my treat. - No, let me... - Sir! Wait! Would you like a dessert? Why did you do that? I don't know. I don't like certain looks. - I'm going. - Why? Thanks for the meal. Don't see me out. What's your telephone number? No, I don't have a phone. And your surname? I don't even know it. Why do you need it? Have you not collected enough? - Goodbye. - My name is Dominique Léonelli. Hi! Hi! I'm coming! Hi! Do you have the Bérault case file? - No, Barnett has it. - I've just been in Barnett's office! Do you have the Bérault case file? Thanks. - Oh, I say, Bertrand! - Yeah! I've got a minor offense here, can you deal with it? It's kind of you, but not every day, thanks! Shit! The boss is asking for you. On my way. Give the court admin this. - Sorry. - Yeah... So? Was Albert's funeral good? Yeah. Do you know how poor Albert was killed? - Do you know how poor Albert was killed? - Yeah. - I read it in the papers. - Ah yes. The papers. It's stupid, isn't it? You missed the murderer by three minutes. - Well, yes! - Well, yes. - Did you see Albert often? - Yes. Every Tuesday evening. Did you know he was Malaggione's brother? - Yes. - Yeah, you're not very talkative are you? Did Albert ever mention Malaggione? No. - Albert didn't talk much. - I know another person like that... Yes, no, yes, no... What am I going to put here, what'll I write! Come on Graziella, try! Just a bit! - Have you seen Malaggione recently? - No. Not since he escaped. In your shoes I'd start to worry! - Oh, why? - If you're in on Albert's death, Malaggione will shoot you. I have nothing to do with Albert's death. Good. That's reassuring! What's up? We're waiting! I'm coming! - What shall I do? - You keep an eye out! Catch him! Don't move! Next time, tie his feet up! You wanted to see me, sir? For a while now! What have you got for me? Nothing. She knows and saw nothing. She heard nothing and feels no guilt. Malaggione wasn't at his brother's funeral. I hadn't expected that! Bertrand! I don't give a damn about your thoughts! I run a squad that a murderer's been mocking for two years. Half mad, half intelligent. I no longer know! This time, I know we have a chance to see him crawl out of his hole... And I won't miss the chance, understood? Handsome Dominique was there! - Who's that girl? - No-one knows her. Very much a florist type. Léonelli must have hit on her while receiving his crown. No, usually Dominique likes the cover-girl type. Yes, cover-girl or florist, No idea where this is going. I don't know either, but we have to try anyway. We need to save the squad's honor. Thanks, gentlemen! Can you have these enlarged? Thanks. - Does it give you any information? - Yes. See the way Léonelli is looking there? It's the look of someone moved by a young girl. - So? - So, it's great, isn't it? - Yes? - I'm not disturbing you, am I? - Who's speaking? - - - It's Sylvia, the girl from the cemetery. Don't hang up... Yes. There's a novel by Jack London beside me. I thought it would be enough company, but, unfortunately, it's not enough... So I called you. - I'm coming. - - - No, I don't want you to. So come here, Sylvia, come right away! Now I'm ashamed. Am I disturbing you? It's so late! - Come up! - No, I'll leave. I left the house, it did me good. I'm calm now. Come here. Do you pretend that the bed is the sea? If you wish, I can say the bed is the sea. It's true, your skin is salty... I just wanted to sleep beside someone. Not to be alone. VITAL JOB, UNEXPECTED BUSINESS. STAY PUT. - The arrival from Clermont- - Ferrand... How's it going? Good, good... - Did you take all the necessary measures? - Yeah. Toussaint is bringing Graziella. - And the funeral? No incidents? - No. No. Your brother was buried as you wished. Good. So Aulnat will be on the 15th. If you're up for it, we'll go one night so you can see the place. Aulnat airport is quiet on Sundays. It will go well. - There. - Good. - Do you like my glasses? - Pretty. How are you, Graziella? You don't look happy to see me? I'm a client like any other, aren't I? Drive towards the woods, I'll direct you. You see Doumé, right away I knew it was Graziella. - Why? - Because she's a woman. Women give themselves to you. And then they end up giving others away. She can't have killed him! No, it's worse. She turned him in, to L'Oranais. Well, let's pay that swine a visit then. It'll come to that, don't worry. Get out... Go on... - You've got a lovely neck. - What? I said, you've got a lovely neck. - What do you want? - Look ahead. - You're hurting me. - Dying doesn't hurt. Surely we can come to an agreement, Ange. An agreement? I don't think so. But I can hear you out. That's why I came, in fact. If you know what I mean. Yes. I'm listening. L'Oranais killed your brother. - I only found out after... - Of course. Look ahead. - It's true. Otherwise, I... - Otherwise? - You'd have stopped him? - Yes. What would you have done to stop him? - I don't know, I... - You don't know, do you? - I would have... - Yeah. You see, this isn't death. It's a punishment, and that's why it hurts. Death, you'll see. - No. - Goodbye, Graziella. You were out a long time. Too long. - Love me quickly... Now. - And afterwards? We'll love each other again. The ID department called. Malaggione's weapon was used to kill Graziella. It was probably revenge for his brother's death. It's just one more death to his name, where does it take us? To L'Oranais. Graziella's lover. On the run for a month. He won't lead us to Malaggione. That's what I'm saying: we're going nowhere! There's always Léonelli. You've been on his case for months and still nothing! But there's the cemetery girl. I'm not ready. It's not cheerful in here, is it! It's OK, I'll take you out like this! - I'm not dressed! - It doesn't matter. Put this on! - Hello? - Come down quickly! - I'm coming! - I'm telling you, get down here. I'm on my way! I won't forget your quiet street! Oh, how kind, I was starting to get hungry. Those cop jerks have told me to move on 15 times at least. What do you say? That I'm a jerk of a cop too. - And the girl? - You were right, she's crashing at Léonelli's. This morning she came out twice: once to go to the pharmacy, the second time to get a ticket at Pleyel, for a South Pole conference. - Did she buy one or two tickets? - One ticket, I said. Penguins are characterized by forelimbs that are covered in small, scaly feathers, and which become paddles, thus rendering it impossible for them to fly, unlike other penguins from the northern regions, with whom they are often confused. Their legs are quite unusual, being located very far back, which means they walk with their body held upright. You'd think we were amongst penguins now, eh... Did you want something? - No, I give up. - Don't. No, you mustn't! Champagne? Two glasses of champagne. Sorry... please! Sorry, madam! Here you go! Do you like it? Yes. I hate penguins, personally! Penguins, icebergs... I can't stand any of it! I'm seeing a shrink. They recommended I come here, to try and get over my shyness. I'm not doing too badly, am I? - You're lying! - Yes! But that's normal. We police are all liars. - Sorry? - I said the police are liars because I'm a policeman, a cop. So you look for pickpockets? Oh dear! Do you think there are some here? Probably! There are always some in a crowd! Look at what happens in the subway or railroad stations. Do you often go there? When I was little, yes. I lived by one... - Sorry. - I dreamt of taking a night train, a luxury one like the Orient Express. When I was a kid, I'd lock myself in the loft. Then I dreamt I was Al Capone, surrounded by Eliott Ness and The Untouchables. You're making it up! You're a fake cop! A fake cop, me? That would surprise me! Trust me, it even has the French flag! Okay, you're a real one! But that doesn't prove you're a good person. I'm not a good person, not at all! Let me tell you, not many people are good people. Let's just say I'm bored by the South Pole, there's a spare seat beside me and you've got a nice profile! You see the mark on my forehead? In India it means: too late. I already belong to a man. Don't move. So, L'Oranais, you're meditating! Did you like my brother? - Did you know he was ill? - What are you talking about, Ange? The truth! Graziella said. You loved him, as far as ending his suffering! There's been a misunderstanding! I have no time to talk, get on your knees! Hey, what's wrong with you today? What do you want me to say? Nothing. What do you prefer, Our Father or Hail Mary? - I swear, Ange. - Hail Mary is shorter... I'm listening! I tell you, it's a misunderstanding. Hail Mary, full of Grace, The Lord is with thee... Do you know it or not? Hail Mary, full of Grace, - the Lord is with thee... - Hands together! Try to pray with fervor... Hail Mary, full of Grace, The Lord is with thee, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Hail Mary, full of Grace, The Lord is with thee, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus... What's this nonsense? - I didn't do it! - Holy Mary, pray for us sinners now, Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death... So be it! Peace and health! You're saying you don't know how to use it? I never said that, I just said I didn't like it, which isn't the same! By the way, what's the chick from the cemetery like in bed? First, she's not a chick. Second, her eyes and ears interest me more than her ass. They can see and listen for me. Can you see runway 27? The Fokker lands on it, having come from the right there! As it's Sunday, there is no traffic so it takes the ramp at the runway end. There he sees the armored truck. Since he gets instructions from the tower, he stops. And we attack and steal the cash. - How many bags is a billion? - Six... In old crumpled papers that the bank is retrieving to burn! The dream! Are things serious with the girl at your place? Why do you ask? No reason. Just remember that the only secret a woman can keep is one she doesn't know. - What do you mean? - You know very well! I don't understand. I don't want a woman in the network, is that clear? I don't want to take any risks and Sylvia's a risk! What's going on, Ange, as soon as we talk about broads, you get angry! Are you a fag or what? No one has ever spoken to me in that way, Doumé! Say it again! Say it again! I asked you if you're a fag? Listen, a women can love when in pain, but never when scared! And I scare them! I don't know why! Something in my eyes, maybe? Do you see something in my eyes? Do I scare you? I don't like streamlined models, they're too car-like! What are you doing here? In a town of three million inhabitants, I'm lucky to meet you for a second time in under eight days? - Answer? - None. None, unless someone was cheating. I cheated: I followed you. - You're mad! - Let's try one! You really are mad! Yes, yes, but that's part of my charm! A stunning postcard! What's the most important bit of a postcard? The image or the message on the back? Do you know what's written on this one? Kisses from Paris, where I met a guy who is clingy and a bit nuts! Well, thanks, it's always nice to hear... That's not the message! The real text talks about traffic, robberies and murders! - Who is Léonelli, do you think? - My lover! Why? Yes, I get it. The mark. But doesn't soap exist? - You don't get it! - No, I don't! I don't see why a woman like you loves a man like him. I don't. Do you know what Dominique does? - He's in finance. - Ah yes, of course. Finance! Well that's a nice job and it pays well! That way he can give you gifts! Is this from him? - Yes, he's in business! - Do you know with who? With Malaggione! Do you know who Malaggione is? He's a killer! - You're completely mad! - No, I'm a cop, that's all. You might say he is less stupid than me, he earns money without trying. - But he works. - Yes, yes. He works in finance, and from time to time in fur. I don't get anything you're saying. - Anyway, I don't believe you. - No? Come with me then... - Hello! Judicial police. - Ladies, gentlemen... I'd like to know if this coat is from here? It's a pretty design. - May I? - Yes, yes. The pelts are splendid. The label has been ripped off, but I can confirm it's from here. Ah! Could it be from the batch that was stolen in spring? Can you check please? I need to check the inventory. Mr. Beaulieu is at a trade fair. Thanks, I'll call him. Goodbye, madam. What can I get you? A scotch, no water, no ice, no nothing... - And for madam? - The same! What does this all mean? In the spring, a van filled with furs was stolen. It was found by Porte des Lilas. The investigation came to nothing, the insurance paid up. So I'm wearing a stolen fur coat? Do you know what that's called? Receiving stolen goods... And do you know what the sentence is? Five years. Five years for Dominique and five for you. - Could you arrest us? - Yes. But I can also offer you a deal. Give me Malaggione for Léonelli. You give me information. I use that information. And I turn a blind eye to Léonelli's activities. Informer. It's that, isn't it? Is that all you can suggest? Thanks. Would you like to be an informer? - Sorry? - Yeah, I'm hiring! Sylvia! - You're crying! - It's because I'm smoking! You don't usually smoke! When I smoke, I cry! What's wrong? Nothing. Come on. What's wrong? Do you know what I did this afternoon? I tried a motorbike! - What? - Well, it's my birthday soon. I'd like you to buy me a motorbike, like you did the fur coat. Unfortunately, it's too expensive for me! I imagine it's a trifle for you. You know where to look for money when you need it. At the bank, like everyone else. Except it's not a checkbook that you get out... It's a revolver. How long were you planning on lying to me for? Until your photo is on the front page of the papers? I have no idea where you got this, but I can tell you this: it's absurd. It's not absurd. It's serious. Do you want some? No. I know who you are. I'm not asking you to justify why you lied to me. I'm not asking you explain why you did this. How you got to this stage. I don't care. It's in the past now... Now, it's either Malaggione or me. I'm not even giving you an hour to decide: you need to decide now! Listen, Sylvia... I don't know how you found this out, but it won't happen again with Malaggione. I've not seen him for five years... I see him in the papers, like everyone else! And I work like everyone else. I do clean business... This is five year-old stuff. Was the coat five years ago? - I bought the coat for you! - Where? I don't know where... Give me a break with the coat... Where are you going? I could have lived with a crook, but definitely not with a liar! Leave, then! Go on, leave! Leave! Hurry up! Sylvia! Shit! You want the truth? Here it is! Yes, I know him and I do deals! I enjoy taking risks, to make money. Please excuse my lack of reading. I know nothing about your novels, Bourges, hydrangeas. Corsican in Paris 17 years is either cop or gangster. I stole my first car, and went to prison. A crook who was less dumb than the others helped me. He was Malaggione. You don't need to know more! It's better for all of us. Do you believe me? Yes, I believe you! And now, who ratted me out? A neighborhood detective. He came about your Porsche. What did you say? Nothing. I didn't know anything. It doesn't matter. Next week I have business to do. After that, I stop everything and we go away together? Okay? Yes, I'm okay with that. - How would you like to pay? - Cash. That'll be 29,280. Here is Mr. Léonelli's ticket for Amsterdam. And your two tickets under the names of Mr. and Mrs. de Neyrac for Caracas. Thanks. In first class. I'm sure you'll be satisfied. Have a good trip. - Thanks. - Thanks. Goodbye! Ladies and gents, which airline? K.L.M. Why did you book under Mr. and Mrs. de Neyrac? Who knows. Hello, you've come at the right time! I have information for you. Dominique has left for Amster­dam for three days. - I didn't ask you for anything! - That's why I am telling you! Shall I take you back? No, don't worry. I'm not on duty. Is that nice smile for me? No, for Dominique. He's good-looking, isn't he? Beauty is relative, you know! People who aren't beautiful always say that! What's the difference between a cop and a crook? I don't see any. I can take it as a compliment then? I wouldn't be so sure! You can never be sure of anything. When I was 20, I wanted to be a singer so that all women would admire me. Except I had no voice, so... Your Dominique is mad, three days in Amsterdam is a long way... it's a long time. - You're very good at your job! - Yes, I know. That's what annoys me! Two girlfriend-mistresses, two lovers... very few sweethearts... the job doesn't lend itself well to them... We're badly paid, and our schedules are not consistent. We're not sure to reach retirement age. And when asked the question, "why be a cop", the inspector burst out: "I ask the questions here!" - Why are you a cop? - Why not? - Where do you want to eat? - At my place. All alone. Or else I don't know! Is there no cafeteria at the PD? Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it. No, I thought we could have dinner one-to-one. You think too much! Take my seat, go on! I'm a bad driver, I tell you! Good timing, I want to die! - Do you like oysters? - Yes. Drive, then. You're very quiet. Not because I'm not thinking. Maybe it's because I feel at ease? I don't know. I don't get you: are you interested in me or my info on Dominique? Who knows? Yeah, 967 HG 63. That's fine. I say, they're on time today. No one moves. You, don't move. - Is that the mail plane? - Yes. Tell them to park at the end of the runway. It's over for the first who does anything stupid. Bravo, Lima. Park at the end of the runway. Received, 27. Park at the end of the runway. At the end of the runway, he cuts his engine. If he cuts his engine, he won't make it to this end. Shut up! Do as I say. It's the first time they've made us park in the daisies. Come on, it's our turn now. - All good with the security guards? - Yes, all good. They usually do the transfer on the 26. I'll ask the tower. No, stay. I'll go. What's going on? Two clowns have come to welcome us. Call the police to move them. I can't, Captain. We're not alone... Francis, it's an attack. A guy is up there with a gun. You rush to the plane. I'll stay here. I'll deal with him. And be careful. Go on. To the tower. Stop or I'll shoot. Come on, I'll cover you. What's up? What's wrong? It was meant to be easy. It's the last time, Ange. You helped me, and I you. We're even. Now, I'm giving up. Are you angry with me? No, I'm not angry with you. That's my strength... I'm never angry, as long as people are loyal. If you want to go, go. You'll get your cash, as agreed. These photos bother me. It's you! No, it's not me. I was sad that day. It was the funeral. - I'm not made for being sad! - No one is! - If I stay, it'll start again! - Why? Do I make you sad? - No. - So stay, then! Goodbye! Ten million francs stolen at Aulnat! That's a billion centimes! The bills were to be reduced to pulp, so it's impossible to trace them. And also two dead bodies, including Pacelli's! Pacelli! Does that ring a bell, Bertrand? A friend of Michelesi's. Together in 69, in the Rambouillet case. How many were at Aulnat? Four, but with masks, so hard to identify them... Four... Pacelli, Michelesi, Malaggione and Léonelli... Not so fast. These are just theories! Malaggione and Michelesi have vanished. But it's easy to check on Léonelli. - What's wrong? - Get dressed! No need to, for sleeping! You'll have plenty of time to sleep, believe me! You're being very cop-like this morning! - Does Clermont- - Ferrand mean anything to you? No? Shame, as there was a hold-up there last night. And two deaths! Don't worry, Domini­que was not a victim. But he can now be classed on the murderers' side. Can you get guns that can shoot from Amsterdam to Clermont Ferrand? You know full well he wasn't in Amsterdam. He pulled the fake departure trick. He passed the airport police for an alibi, but he didn't board the plane. Were you in the plane? You really took the piss last night, eh? - What are you doing? - I'm visiting. That's what it is when you have no warrant. - May I? - You are vile! I'm doing my job. You're not a cop doing a search. You're just a disappointed, jealous guy. We'll be able to talk about this... come on! INTERIOR MINISTRY Right. To sum up. One, receiving stolen goods. Two: possessing fake ID papers for a fake passport. Three: harboring a criminal, Dominique... I am happy to admit you were taken advantage of. I can try to do all I can to get you out of here. But you need to help me, so tell me about Malaggione. I know nothing. I have nothing to tell you. I don't give a damn about you! I want to go home. Right, Vidal! Put her in the slammer! Once you've found your tongue, you'll let me know! - Hello! - Hello! See you! - What are you doing? - Getting some fresh air... - Come on, let me get you a coffee. - No. Some country ham? - A dry white wine? - No. - Are you having regrets? - Regrets about what? I'm innocent, you know it. I didn't do anything. - Above all, you didn't say anything. - But I know nothing. I'm convinced of the opposite. You're obsessed by Malaggione, but I've never met him... Only Dominique sees him. - I'm not in the loop about anything. - Of course. Anyway, you'll have plenty of time to think. Lawfully, I can keep you here 24 hours. As it's no small matter, the prosecutor is going to give me another 24 hours. So, that's two days we get to spend together. It's great, isn't it? However, I'll no longer be here to help you after that. Then you'll be detained, and the judge will accuse you of receiving stolen goods... And then prison, where you won't receive many visits, you know. Probably me, from time to time, so you won't be too lonely. But, it'll be too late... Nothing to say? Please... You're the only one who can help Dominique. So talk to me. The smallest detail has importance. He made a phone call. - To Toussaint. - Toussaint Michelesi? I don't know. - He told him to go see Héléna. - Which Héléna? I don't know. He spoke about Cherbourg. No, not Cherbourg: Le Havre. Yes, that was it, Le Havre. Nothing of Malaggione? I only remember one thing. One evening, we dined out at the Au Vieux Victor Hugo bistro, we were looking for a place to park and Domi­nique said: there's Malaggione's parking lot, on Octave Feuillet street... but you need a magnetic keycard... What do I do now? You go home. Well played! Know who this Héléna is? A former whore that Michelesi brought up from Toulon. She lives in Le Havre, she's on file... - Diallo, call Le Havre, Buret... - Yes, boss. If Michelesi is there, Buret will arrest him. Buret's a good cop. There's also Léonelli, who's still not gone home. His apartment is under surveillance. Let's take care of Malaggione and his magnetic keycard... Hello? Hey Buret! I've got a good catch for you... They're downstairs, on the street... - Don't do this, Toussaint! - Leave it! Do I count for nothing? No-one knew I was here?! Don't piss me off! It's going to cost me as it is. Did you grass me up? You shouldn't have shared my address! Even to Dominique who always called! I'd warned you! Give it to me! They won't go easy on you. Do you want to die? Open up. Police. Hand yourself in, Michelesi. I'm coming! Easy does it! Hey, I'm at home here. Shut it! You're not allowed to just take people like this. I've done nothing. There are laws... Shit! I've done nothing, for God's sake! There are laws! Shit, leave me be. - There are laws here. - Leave him alone. Shit! Leave me alone. Michelesi was arrested at Le Havre. Malaggione is still nowhere to be found, but there is that parking lot with the magnetic keycard at 18 Octave Feuillet street. This is what I suggest: We set up an emergency system, on Octave Feuillet street. We think big. I position a van in front of the parking lot. With Bertrand and Vidal. I'll be in a taxi in the middle of the set-up. SOS BREAK-DOWN You can't park here! This is an embassy, you've got to go. - It's just for five minutes. - No, not possible. Forget it. Five minutes! Okay, five minutes tops, or else I'll call the cops. Agreed. Alpha here. Is everyone in position? Tell me your positions. - Alpha two here. Everything is in place. - Perfect. Warning, Malaggione just arrived. He's bought newspapers at the kiosk. He's going to cross avenue Henri Martin. - I'll follow him! - Don't lose him, Guillot! I'm afraid he might notice me. I'll stop tailing him! He's alone, he's carrying on, he's going to turn right on Henri Fournier street. Warning, he's all yours now! If he goes past, don't miss him! No, it's as good as done. Tonight, you'll be on the main channel on TV. He's not going in the garage, he's crossing! Bertrand, did you see him? Stop or I shoot. Ah! - Get out. - He's mad! Are you okay? - Go grab the car. - Yes. If I'd had my gun, I'd have gotten that bastard Malaggione! I hope Diallo pulls through, otherwise, I'm quitting. When you're a cop, Bertrand, you accept your responsibilities and you leave your emotions out of it! We tried calling you three times, Chief! Michelesi escaped... from Le Havre! Oh shit! What a day! Hello? Sylvia? Sylvia, it's Bertrand! Listen Sylvia, we're in the shit! Michelesi has escaped. We didn't catch Malaggione! So, from now things are going to get very dangerous. You need to stay away from Dominique. Don't leave your home, don't reply to the phone anymore. I don't give a damn about Dominique, Sylvia! Ah, I was scared! It went wrong, the cops are outside my house. We'll find a hideout until Malaggione pays me. And then we get out. Still okay with you? Yes, that's fine. Only Dominique knew that I was hiding at Héléna's. - No, there was Pacelli. - Yes. Pacelli is dead. - I knew too. - Stop your bullshit. Know why the cops were at your place on Octave Feuillet? You're right. Someone's been talking. Know what we should do? I know what I'm going to do. - What's he up to? - I don't know. What's that? - What? - Did you not hear? The door over there? Do you trust the guy? He's the only one who can find us a place to hide. - Give it back once you're done. - Okay. - See you, Nando, thanks. - See you and be careful! I don't see how Michelesi got nabbed. No-one knew his hideout... I must get hold of Malaggione. You don't need Malaggione. I do, to get my share. Otherwise, we have nothing. We don't have to go so far. There's Spain, Italy. There's sunshine and it's cheap. Escaping is very, very expensive. I can work. I can look after kids. I'm used to it. Never mind, I'm going to try Costa. I must tell you something. Wait! Ah shit, it's engaged. What's up? Something that's not easy to say. Go on! I informed on Michelesi. What are you saying? - You didn't know where he was hiding. - I did. One day you called Le Havre. A certain Héléna. You spoke with Michelesi. For Malaggione, you mentioned the Octave Feuillet parking lot, that's all the police needed. How? How could you do that? I met an inspector. He said he'd leave you alone if I helped get Malaggione. Why did you do that? For you, only for you. Why did you do that? Why did you do that? Why did you do that? - Why? - Because I love you. Go away. Here. Go on, get out! Go. Get out! - Costa? - - - Is that you, Doumé? It's me, yes... Tomorrow, at 11 o'clock, your parcel will be at counter 15. - Will he be there? - - - I don't know. Okay... - - - Bye. - Bye! Sorry. I'll get the money at 11 o'clock tomorrow. Then, we'll leave. - You're meeting Malaggione? - There's no other way. I don't want you to go. Know what the loveliest picture in my life is? No. A sad little girl. In a cemetery. UNDERGROUND PUBLIC PARKING LOT Will you wait? I won't be long. - Are you armed? - Yeah. - Give it to me! - Why? If you're going to need it I don't want you to go. - What can I get you? - A hot chocolate, please! I'm happy to see you, Doumé. - It's true I'm pleased to see you. - Got the dough? - Yes, of course. In the car. - Let's go then. Why are you in a hurry? It might not be safe to stay here. Don't worry. I took precautions. But I did last time, and the cops were still there. Strange, no? Get in, we need to talk. Your cash. What were you saying? Don't you have anything to say? Thanks. You must know someone grassed. Really? Who? Do you not know who? It's sure not Toussaint, it's not me or you, as you're a man of honor. Maybe the cops found your hideout by chance, they've been on you ages. Yes... but I can assure you, someone betrayed us, someone different, someone who isn't like us, like Sylvia, for example. I think she went to see the cops. Léonelli for Malaggione. I can say it wasn't her. Since I know you love her, I respect that. I won't ask for punishment. I'll do it. I promise: she won't suffer. Wait! What proof do you have it was her? There aren't just four of us. You've got a janitor, right? I'm telling you it's not her. Why don't we ask her. If it wasn't her, then there's no issue. - It doesn't cost us anything? - As you wish. Drive. Fine, Ange, forget it. It was me... I betrayed you. Both of you. I got caught up in a fur matter. The cops gave me no choice. Sorry, I couldn't do anything else. I don't believe you. If it were true, the cops would be here. Look, the cops didn't get you so don't be a pain. - I'll take the cash and go. - No, don't leave. Oh really? Seriously? Follow him. Dominique? Why are you following me? I told you, you're a fag, Malaggione! Call the police. - Hey, Costa. - Hey, how's it going? Not bad... What's the dish of the day? Lamb chops and beans. I'll be upstairs. Costa, my half pint. - Yeah. - - - It's Sylvia... Dominique... They killed Dominique. - Where are you? - - - At the hotel on Deux Gares street. Don't move, I'm coming. So? He hasn't left. - He's alone. - Yes. - Where did it happen? - In the parking lot at the station. - They were waiting for him. - Don't move. I'll be back. I'd like to know. Would you have let Dominique and I leave? Yeah. Don't leave the girl. A half pint please. - And a coffee. - A coffee. You'll excuse me. - Everything okay, ladies and gents? - Good, thanks. Laurent! Are you out of your mind? Let go. Is the bike yours? Malaggione! Bertrand! The girl from the cemetery told me to give you this. Has she been gone long? No, she just left. She went that way. Sylvia! Sylvia! Subtitle translation by: Ginger Clark
