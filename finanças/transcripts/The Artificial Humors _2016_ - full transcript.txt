The Artificial Humors Hut. Yawalapiti village. Hello, friends. My name is Andy Coughman. The woman with me is Claude Laroque, my inventor, my friend. Claude has always dreamed of making me a smart machine. And this young girl is Jo, she teaches me emotions. Very good. You're happy now. Very pleased. Good. Now disgust. Disgust. Good. Tell me a joke. Coughman, you're a turd from a witch doctor's ass. Claude tried to program me, so that I can decipher all emotions. I didn't get it, but I'll laugh for the sake of politeness. Wittgenstein said, that the big questions can only be solved with humor.. This is illogical, He didn't have enough fortitude in solving such issues. Actually, humor can be a liberator, as well as a prison. An old legend says that irony is a bird, who has learned to love her cage. Even if she sings about her contempt for this cage, she likes to live in such an environment. " ANIMISM " The Secret of Artificial Intelligence Claude adapted to the rhythm of life of the people of Xingu. And I pretended to be clownish. But that's the beauty of humor. Negative turns into positive. Futility turns into intimacy. Sometimes, with the force of a storm. One day, at dawn Claude went on a boat trip. I took advantage of her absence, to do the unthinkable. Ahem...ahem. Excuse me? Tunuly, I'd like to talk to you about your daughter. I'm in love. Jo makes me feel like a real person. Butterflies are fluttering in my stomach. Tunuly, I would like to ask you, with all due respect, for your daughter's hand. She has the most beautiful soul, that I know. While I was opening my soul to Tunuly, someone else heard my confession. Jo's father seemed pleased with my sincerity. But I was wrong. The next day, Claude was summoned to the hut of a powerful chief. Peremptorily he told her that our stay in the village was over. I knew very well, that my innocent request caused our exile. But Claude didn't suspect anything. Jo. I know you're sad. Take me in your arms, please. Let's get out of here, Claude. I’m sick of it. Let's hurry. Sick of it. Let's go. My God, I don't believe it! You're crazy! - No, Claude, there are jaguars! - Leave me alone. And snakes too! Don't stay here, Claude! Don't stop now. Jo's father tried to stop the plane taking his daughter away. But fortunately, it was too late. How hot it is here! Don't you think? Very hot. Yes. Jo? Jo explained her reason to Claude. She was outraged at her father's attitude, expelling us. Claude offered Jo a short stay in São Paulo, for a while, to make peace with her father. Come in, Jo. Come in. Make yourself at home. If you need a bathroom, it's there. And I was the happiest person in the world. Lovely! I’ll take a photo. Turn around, Jo. "Cheese." Claude, this movie is full of cliches, isn't it? It's full of cliches, I think. Are they ghosts? They’re Japanese. She looks a bit like me, doesn't she? Yeah. Well, you're hotter. Hotter. Hotter. The following week Claude returned to the school where she taught artificial intelligence and explained my emotional education. If Coughman starts with " What are these red buttons..." he will know what follows and finish "on my butt". To make a joke, we have to invert the grammatical rules, defy statistics, create improbable contrasts. In the absence of our baby-sitter, my desire for this little angel became irresistable. - Did the Monster tear it apart like that? - Yes. Why? So that we can eat it in parts, and not swallow it whole. But why? He's so cute. So cute. But not as much as you. A fish is an animal. An octopus is an animal. A dog is an animal. A cow is also an animal. He's really funny. When we eat animals, they die. Why? - So we can eat. - Why are they dying? I don't like them dying. I like it when they're standing. One day Claude gave a course on comedy about Facebook posts. Her friend Hans, an organizer of stand-up comedy, came to look in on the class. He made an offer, that transformed my life forever. What if Coughman performs in a stand-up? Coughman? In stand-up? I think he's too simple for that. My dear, I'm tired of Debussy. Don't you want to play some ragtime, or take a cake-walk? Or, even better, smoke, drink while lying on pillows? Why are you looking at me like that? This moment was the most sensual of my whole life, but this should not continue. Hi, Claude. I need to take Coughman to school. Let's go! Come on! I don't want to! Coughman, don't be a child. Let's go! I'll be quick, my dear. Claude took me with her, with the idea of reprogramming me. But I didn't want to be a stand-up robot. I don't want to be reprogrammed! Coughman! I want my memory! Let me be who I am! Claude, leave me alone! But she had to. Claude took my memory. Claude... I don't want to be reprogrammed. I feel very... tired, Claude. And my sweet Jo was left alone in São Paulo. " Intrinsic Comedy " Programming an algorithm capable of creating jokes, turned out to be a difficult task. While Claude day after day searched for the key to humor, Jo managed to master Chopin's nocturnes. System reboot. Reprogramming as stand-up comedian completed. You're beautiful. Hi, Claude. Shall we have coffee? Is that you Jo? Hello. Sorry I'm late. - Charlatan! - Lunatic! I'm too nervous, friends. Coughman? Do we know each other? Sorry, sweetheart, something strange happened to my head. I don't remember anything or anyone. Please keep in mind. Coughman has a new identity. It's true! Coughman is now a feminist comedian. Hans, are we a ‘go’? Help me, I've stage fright. Please. Please! Hi everybody. Thank you for coming to this experimental humor show. Welcome Andy Coughman, the robot humorist. Good evening, everyone! Thank you for coming. Thank you for being here. Today is a special day for me. I bought my first iPhone. I went to the Apple store. It was worth it. I spent three hours there. Or eight. But it was worth it. Now I just need pants pockets. Where should I put my phone? I finally decided on my sexuality. I'm bi... narian. I downloaded the Tinder app, got registered. Did everything I needed to do. I love it! Everyone tells me I'm a sex machine. Thank you very much! Sorry if these jokes are stupid. I relied on an Anglo-Saxon algorithm. Shortly after my stage debut, Jo disappeared without warning. Hi, Rafaela. This is Jo. I'm in Canaran. Could you… I'm near a big market. Can I stay with you? I'm at a loss. Okay, I got it. I'm looking for number 26. It's the house next door. Thank you. May I come in, Rafaela? Rafaela! - I'm Jo. - Rafaela, glad to see you. - Come in. - Thanks. The room is here. You have to pay in advance. - In advance? - Yeah. I'll see how much I have. In São Paulo my career was taking off. I walk into my suite with a porter and he asks me: " Do you have a condom? " My stupid jokes the people of São Paulo liked them. A condom? I don't even have pants! I was even invited onto the coolest talk show " The Gossip. " Good evening, everyone! - Good to see you. - Glad to be here. I’m a big fan, I love what you do. Thanks. Andy, when you're joking, are you really making political statements? No. No. I'm a robot. You know, I can't even vote. I'm joking about robots. I love it. That's cool. So what's next for you? At the moment I'm preparing my tour in Europe. I'm launching my new show in London. It's a huge honor, I have stage fright, but it will pass. Brilliant. Stay there, Andy. Give a hand! Our next guest is Luis Antonio. Give a round of applause! Hi, Louis, how are you? Come on, sit down. Luis Antonio, I adore you. I've seen your video 300 times which has collected 5 million views. Incredible! For those who don't know, Louis is a famous vegetarian who talks to animals. Will you tell us how you talk to animals? - No. - You don't talk to animals anymore? But can you show us what you did before? An octopus is an animal. Chickens are animals. Cows are animals. " An octopus is an animal." " A chicken is an animal." The boy's voice... My memories are back! The love of my life. Is everything okay with her? Claude was looking for me everywhere. She thought I was being stupid. But realistically, I just went for it. " I miss you. " " I miss you. " " I'm right here. " -Jo. -Coughman! I can't live without you. I love you very much. My heart is overflowing with love for you. Let's get married?
