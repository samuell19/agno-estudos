BRIEF CROSSING Bloody hell Damn Your ID is torn. And it's not valid - How old is it? - It was issued in 1990 It's just not strong enough You have to use a plastic cover - Is it OK? - Yes, it's OK Captain Shutland and his crew... ... welcome you on board the Pride of Le Havre to Portsmouth We'll be leaving the harbour in a few minutes Children should not run on the ship... ... or use the lifts unless accompanied by an adult We wish you a pleasant crossing Excuse me, do you need a... I feel stressed I speak French I only bought a packet with my mates, to show off I didn't think I'd get hooked At home, everyone smokes My mum smokes with me in the evening. She likes it - She likes it? - Yes, she does She's been smoking since she was 14 She's never managed to quit All my mates smoke too Kids with uncool parents smoke in secret They say their parents are stupid - Your mum’s cool? - Yes, very cool My dad always moans she's too soft on me - What does he do? - He's an auditor He's not cool, but he's OK He's nice But not as nice as my mum. She adores me Still, she went mad when I fucked up my GCSEs She wasn't happy - Fucked up? - Failed I didn't study. Usually I wake up in the last term and work like mad This time I didn't wake up so I did nothing That's not clever You should have seen my teachers. All idiots They can't all be idiots Yes, teaching is a stupid job anyway - Are you a teacher? - No, a photographer Imagine going back to school to repeat the same crap to pupils who don't care There are more exciting jobs It doesn't even pay well All our teachers suck... - So we don't want to learn - You still have to attend classes That's what mum says, but I still didn't study So now I have remedial classes It stinks, but it serves me right - How old are you? - I'm 18 You’re 18? No coffee? It stops me sleeping Nothing stops me sleeping. Not even ten cups. My problem is waking up Life is so boring Endless and boring But, at the same time, it goes so quickly. Years pass like weeks You don't have time for anything The question is how can you be making a living since you’re not doing anything I don't do anything Any idea what you want to do? Don't you wonder how adults finance their cars, flats and country homes? They cost a fortune You can't understand where all that money comes from. It's not from a job It's not from the courses you can choose. There is no choice Except teaching Or being a doctor, a vet, a solicitor... That's scary when you’re young, right? You’ve no idea what you want to do But everyone's determined to help you choose a career By being pushed one way and the other, you end up nowhere But you mustn’t worry. It comes naturally... ...with age Just be confident and don't worry about the future They make a fuss about the future as if it needed mapping out But it comes naturally. It's given to you You just need the gift... ...to know when opportunity knocks Adults clip Your wings and sometimes you can't catch up with Your future You’re born whole, but other people mutilate you with their fears... ...about security, full employment and sensible things Isn't modern life horrible? No, you just have to think very seriously about what you want to do A well-paid job in a not too crowded industry. It's pointless... ...doing sociology or law just to get cast off What matters these days is looks. It is All women above 30 worry It depends Even men fear being thrown on the scrap heap Plastic surgery is the way to go All oldies want to have their faces done even if they say they disapprove I don't know. When I need to, maybe... Everyone wants a facelift sometime And then I'll be the perfect, dedicate surgeon Thomas Seigner I'll take 10 years off you, but I'll take all Your savings I'm joking, but you can make a lot. The prices aren't fixed by the NHS £4,000 per operation If I do two or three a week, it's OK. I can live on that But studying until 30 isn't for me That's because you’re so young. 30 isn't old. You get there very quickly Another coffee? - You’re right. Why not try the bars? - You want to drink? We're on a ship for the night, so it would be a shame to go to bed early... ...and not do anything romantic - Would you do something men hate? - What do men hate? Everything, but most of all shopping Ladies and gentlemen you have ten minutes left... ... to purchase spirits wine and cigarettes at excellent prices - I thought I'd lost it - Now's not the time Guaranteed to turn you into an alcoholic Help me. All these wines are French I've no idea. I only drink coke They force us to buy wine... ...since you’re allowed two bottles instead of one for whisky Moulton Cadet. That's very good And for me, Champagne. Bubbly and tasteless. Perfect It's twice the price in England You don't care, do you? How about some mint chocolates? It's a speciality Marmalade. You can't get it in France Don't bother to justify Yourself You must think I'm a jerk No, 16 is nearly 18 No, it's not. You must think I'm grotesque It's pointless me talking I'm going to ruin Your evening Look, there are only teenagers. It's no coincidence You’re wrong. Look behind me That's even worse Did I say the wrong thing? Unforgivable I don't find them young. They're just conforming They're pretending to be posh. Even the girlfriend is just for show But they don't give a shit They just act posh. It's all part of the look Did you hear their conversation? It's pathetic I'll get myself a brandy You shouldn’t have Leave it - Or I'll be cross - I'll get the next one After this, I'll start feeling a lot better You think I'm crazy because I drink? When you’re young, you want to be old. When you’re old, you want to forget - You’re not old - I am. That's why I drink You don't drink a lot Two neat brandies is quite a bit You’d be on the floor I'd have to carry you to bed But I can hold my drink I can drink a lot more without it showing - It's the privilege of the old - You’re not that old "Not that old," he says meaning not that young Because disappointment is inevitable Not always Yes, always We don't know what's better The magic moment lasts only while men want to seduce us... ...and you frolic in green meadows It's miraculous But then you end up in the cowshed like a cow chewing old dry hay It's over The couple is in place. You’ve had it That's a tough view It's our fault as well We women know men are as bad as each other. We shouldn’t get caught We're too romantic. We can't help believing in love We won't admit that once they've screwed us, men lose interest Aren't I right? Aren't men like that? Aren't you all like that? You’re right. It's Your strength Being in a couple is appalling But you’d rather keep what you have than be alone It's better for a woman to be married than alone I don't know I'm single. I made a mistake I couldn’t find fault with my husband. He wasn't even unfaithful That was even worse. He'd totally lost interest in me I was part of the furniture, like a chair you sit on Is it normal to treat a person like a thing? Is it bearable? Should I have stayed? I should have stayed, but it was like a concrete screed. I was suffocating Imagine the eyes of the one you love lighting up... ...only when they see someone other than you And when they look at you, their eyes become terrifyingly opaque... ...hard and ugly, so they can ignore you We're balls and chains to them Men don't want to live with us as couples It's unfair But they're attached to us when they've made us like that They never expect us to leave I really got the bastard It'll take him a while to get over it. I was the one who left It's not in my nature to leave, though But I dumped my husband yesterday I should have done it sooner Imagine wasting eight years... ...with a man who can't look at you after three months Why do we do it? We don't even have children He always took precautions A man who loves a woman doesn't take precautions You see what it means? Isn't it sordid? Why should you care? You’re young. Things might work out better for you Things have to change. They'd better - Will you have another drink? - No, thanks I will. It's my first night as a single woman No, I'll go On the sea, we're above the law You’re right Shall we drink to Your studies? - To Your love life - Nothing to boast about - He didn't deserve you, that's all - Who? Your husband. He must have been an arsehole It's not that simple Maybe they're simple and we're complicated Bloody hell, not a stupid show That's not enough. To prove you don't exist and take up too much room... ...the guy makes you disappear He sticks the swords in Your body. That's a parable. A real one Nothing is more real than parables He bows... ...and we clap. He's as proud as a peacock The bastard! Men really are cleverer than us It doesn't bother him that she's suffocating in the box... ...and does all the dirty work The man stays whole. He's magnificent Life only mutilates women because they're more generous Contrary to belief, they age better Women never become bald, paunchy or full of themselves at 40, do they? You’re protected by Your youth. You’re still safe Watch out It might not last But Your hair is nice and thick It's beautiful It's an asset But be careful. You can lose it at 25 No hair left. Only a smooth pink bottom It changes everything Still, you have a round skull, so it would be more bearable Yes, but it would freak me out You can lose Your hair and still be a great person But you must escape the male condition Men's contortions and arrogance. You must exist. Men don't exist... ...because they can't reproduce. That's their problem So... They invent ways to bring women down... ...and to make themselves feel powerful Bureaucracy is a man's job It produces nothing No wealth Just pathetic feeble power Like a premature ejaculation A fat belly and a chubby little smile You think all men are like that? All those we meet, yes All those I've met anyway They're all the same Only strangers are remotely interesting You’ve chosen very badly the men you’ve... What? Nothing Let's dance Not my style Don't abandon me now I fall in love That's obvious since they're men Are there really no good men? Maybe very young ones who are still romantic like girls Lips like ripe fruit I'll really have to get used to it. It's not my thing Usually, I prefer tough virile beasts That's what I claim anyway But I always go with the opposite Boys who could be my sons aren't my thing Why not? I know it's silly I should let myself go It wouldn’t even count I'd never fall in love with someone who can't hurt me It would be exquisite, but I'm masochistic You don't like kind men? I prefer those who make me suffer I suppose I like a good fight I don't understand. I love tenderness Cuddling is lovely Cuddling is awful. It's pointless That's not what excites you It's better to be alone than with the wrong person Don't you ever think it's lovely to be with someone? Sometimes, but I'm wrong You’re a hard woman. I thought you were sweet When I saw you, I found you sweet. I wanted to take you in my arms So men can be wrong too You’re hard. You make fun of me because I love you One day I'll be older And you’ll be really old, sorry and alone I'm sorry It's OK When the water's dark, I'm drawn to it and I fall in When I was little I always fell in ponds watching goldfish Be careful. I won't rescue you - You won't rescue me? - I don't want to die for nothing How dare you? It's true. The water is 15°C and it's dark We wouldn’t last 10 minutes I can be chivalrous, but not stupid It's OK. I'm not asking for a survival lesson I'm asking you to be romantic I want to sleep with you Very romantic. You think you just say that to a woman and it works? Sorry if I'm being crude With you, I don't know how to be Women like crudeness... ...contrary to belief Women don't want subtlety What are you looking at? Nothing. I'm waiting You need to learn it's up to men to make the first move It's not for women to help them It's exciting to disconcert them and see how they return to the attack Let's go Do you have a room? This is the dreaded moment when you have to get down to business Let's go to my cabin We won't be disturbed But there's always a risk we'll be interrupted... ...and we won't want to start again Maybe we should stop here, with good memories - It's great. There's a porthole - Yes, I have a porthole It's silly. Even luxury cabins don't have double beds - Maybe this isn't a good idea - Don't say that I'm awful. I just can't make things easy I'm feeling shy It's incredible at my age I can't bring myself to cheat on my husband But it's over Have you ever been in love? But I've never been all the way I can't go all the way. Something stops me When did you split up? Three months ago, but we were together for eight years - I'm sure that doesn't stop him - Really? - Three months... - You think he's cheated on me already It's likely The bastard You really are all bastards There's no love. Only words to get what you want And we women are so stupid we take it at face value You’re all bastards who take us for pieces of flesh I dreamt of seeing Your breasts I love breasts Easy Don't be fast like all the others Easy. The best way to make love to a girl is with a slow rhythm Gently quivering inside I like Your soft skin You’re soft all over You’re just like a child. I can't believe how young you are - You look like you’re 16 - Really? It's amazing how young you look But I have crow's feet That doesn't matter. You look young anyway Maybe because I'm very young in my head - Stay - I'm too hot Do you have lots of girlfriends? Things are very different these days They can't be that different They are. We don't have steady girlfriends No big dramas No dramas? No dramas How do you love each other then? You wouldn’t understand. It's much more casual these days If Your girlfriend's not there, you can go out with another... And then you can go out with Your girlfriend again Go out? Go out again? Interesting vocabulary Can you turn it off? It's unbearable If I turn it off, you’ll go back to sleep I want to say hello to you again With you lot, it's all or nothing You either wake up triumphantly or you go back to sleep instantly It's bestial I hate it when you say: "You lot." I like it when you’re sweet I'm not sweet I know I'm far too sweet. You only like nasty men - That's not true - Yes, it is Hurry up. You’re such a slowcoach You men are so slow Stop saying: "You men." It makes me feel I'm not me Hurry up. Don't be like the others I'm not the others True. You’re much more charming - Let's have our photo taken - No way Closer together Smile, please We look good Will you write something nice? It's on me Captain Shutland informs you... ... that we will be coming alongside Portsmouth harbour in 40 minutes At 5.30 English time and 6.30 French time You’re hungry? We're arriving We've got time Can't you wait for us to part? Passengers with vehicles... Don't take any notice You’d better go and get Your case. You must have one somewhere Hurry up. Stop dithering You’re not making things easy for me Swear you will
