Production: WAKAMATSU Koji Screenplay: DEGUCHI Izuru - Let me go! - If you shout, I'll kill you! Cut it out, I don't want to! Let me go, you're hurting me! I don't want to! - Quiet down. - Let me go! Cut it out! No, no! Let me go, you're hurting me. Let me go! No, no! Let me go! Raping someone means making love rapidly. You mean, making it on the run? Of course, you must do it very rapidly. Understood, quickly! Be a good girl. Enough! Leave, everyone! - Look. - Cut it out! You're hurting my arms! I said you were hurting me! Let me go! Stop it! Let go of me! You're hurting me! No! If it's not violent, it's not a rape. You're hurting me! - I'm ready. - I'll do it. Hurry up. No, no, let me go. Calm down. Ah! Let me go! - Toru, what're you doing?! - You're hurting me! - Stop it! - Damn! You're hurting me! Don't tear my skirt. Don't worry. I'll kill anyone who's not doing it for real. I mean it. Don't move. It doesn't look like a real rape. We must be quick in a rape, but with all of us it looks like an orgy. - Rape and orgy are the same thing. - You're wrong. In a rape, one fucks a girl and the two of them become one. In an orgy, as they all do it, they are all involved. It doesn't work this way... Stupid! - Do it for real. - It's absurd, I won't. I'll be next. We'll make an orgy. Here I come! The orgy has replaced the rape... The pants... There are many ways one can make quick sex. Maybe gang rape and orgy are the same thing, as he says. - You always have fun this way? - Well, yes. Really. Anyway, both in a rape and in an orgy, you fuck someone, so you must do it for real. We need a woman for a rape. Let's go look for one. Quickly. Of course. Let's wrap it in here for now. "SENSUAL GAME" (Seiy√ªgi) It's useless. Will we ever find one?

Yodare? Yodare! Leave me alone. Yodare! Mother, father I'm very tired. I can't even move. Forgive me if I'll die first. I'm tired of running... I'm not that stupid. What time is it? Seven o'clock. What the heck... Don't be sad. Leave me alone. Do it a little further! Get up! How long would you like to sleep? It's morning, guys. - Read something! - Thanks a lot! All right, let's see... Move yourself. "My body and my heart are gelid... I'm cold." "Come, So cold! - It's freezing! - Aren't you cold? "You know, I've wanted you badly after that guy's death?" - What time is it? - "Come into my arms. " - Where's the alarm clock? - "Like you are, naked. " "Come and enter into my naked heart. " What time is it? "This world, I don't know if it's day or night. " Read in silence, moron! Someone tell me what time is it. Someone tell me. What time is it? Here you are, you Half past eight! I'll be late if I don't hurry up. Will you strap it? Hurry up. What a temper! Great. "Honey, I was waiting for this moment. " "I... " "The woman forgot about everything and came a couple of times in the man's arms. " "Came a couple of times in the man's arms. " It says she came a couple of times. You, see about that! "They both showed the joy of life through love's ecstasy in the endless night. " "However, at the break of dawn, the man didn't understand that the woman was, in reality, a streetwalker. " "One of those messy heads, hurriedly putting her lipstick back on. " Did you say streetwalker? "Their love was circumscribed to that night. " Don't you be making no hints! It says so in the comic... Stupid! I have to go out; you all go home. Leave, now! Hurry up! Get dressed and leave! Move it! Hurry! "Oh, Fuyukichi!" "The manic morning is here. " Give me the cigarette. Give it to me. - I want it. - Stay calm, or I'll slap you. It's that one that I wanted. Where're we going? The University? At the University? It's been a while since I haven't gone there. - But why don't you just drop out? - My father grumbles. Yesterday was a total failure, that's for sure. It was impossible doing it for real with those girls. - Why's that - Because they're like whores, having sex is as natural for them as saying hi. What should we do? I can't understand her only by looking into her eyes. You never can understand anything. Let's go to the University. Let's drive around. Let's go to the cinema! Classes can't have restarted already. Or they have... What news about the protests? Still going on. - Since when? - I don't know. - What the hell are those ones doing? - That woman, that woman. If we to do it, it must be with a frightened woman. - Faking is useless; must be the real thing - Right. As long as we look and try, we won't get to doing it for real. True, true! We were shaking the first time. I felt like laughing. You, Obake, you were the worst. Why's that? You wet your pants. With the woman from the bar. Oh, that one... Something similar happened to you also. You came right away. I'm sick of you, you impotent! Shut up, moron! You should have more self-control, like I do. What about me? You, Gaira, are the opposite. I can't get excited if it's not for real. - What're you saying? - You look like you'd do it any time. - It's because of the emotion. - Even yesterday you were horny enough. Stop pulling my leg. Any way, we have to do it. We have to have something to do. Practice, practice. We have to practice. But there are so many girls! Let's look for a real one. Now, the universities in strike have everywhere become free zones. "AN INDEFINITE STRIKE IS UNDER WAY" Now, the universities in strike have everywhere become free zones. "AN INDEFINITE STRIKE IS UNDER WAY" They'll surely be having free sex inside. "AN INDEFINITE STRIKE IS UNDER WAY" Moron, that's all bullshit. The papers write absurd things. Moron, that's all bullshit. The papers write absurd things. - What's that supposed to mean? - We are serious. But, if it actually was a free zone, would that be a bad thing? If it was... Hey, do you know her? I think I've seen her. She's an activist from the liberal arts college. She's attractive. - You wouldn't... - Yes, let's try and ask her. What's happening inside. - But, it's risky here. - There're people around, it's dangerous. If we do it the usual way, it'll be easy. You can be so easy about it because you're from another university. Moron, what's that got to do with it? On the contrary, it'll be fun. It's risky. - Are we, or aren't we going to do it? - All right, let's do it. "19TH NOVEMBER ALL OUT STUDENT INSURRECTION MEETING" "INSURRECTION" Hey, listen! C'mon, hurry up! What're you doing? - Don't you worry about it. - Rednecks! Shall we go to the same place? - No, let's do it at the University. - At the University?! Quickly! Hey, here we are behind the barricades. What silence... We can't go through. Even here's blocked. There's a graveyard silence. Can they have arrested them? They've clashed recently. You're from the athletic club, aren't you? You'll regret such a vile act. - Fascists! - What're you saying?! Servants of the Right! Dogs! Sorry to disappoint you, but we've got nothing to do with them. Don't hide! Who ordered you to do this? Shut up! We are only students who want to gang rape you. - Nobody ordered us to. - That's absurd! Apolitical morons! You're playing tough. I'll do it for real with her. What're you doing inside the barricade? - That's not your business! - Well, what's the matter? - You're just hanging around every day. - Of course. You were getting busy there? You'll do it with all of us! If you'll do it with us also, we'll go fight. Let me go! No, help! - Shall we do it? - Of course. Help! Listen carefully. I think you are doing a great job. But I don't believe in all of this. Understand? - No! - Don't fret. Cut it out! Mother... She starts with being fresh and, then, she cries for mammy. You've resigned yourself... You've got ready to being fucked. A container ready to receive a man. All women moan while they're being fucked. We're doing this for real. There's nothing more serious than fucking with a woman. Moron! Move! Three persons blending into one. It isn't bad getting fucked, is it? Do men want to fuck and women to get fucked? With me, there'll be four of us. Four people blending into one. - Nobody has seen anything like this. - True. - What shall we do? - Let's leave her here and beat it. That conceited broad will soon be out of here. We could even forget about her. She wouldn't want to be seen. She must be in shock. Look. Shall we drive you to school? Are you getting in or not? Let's leave her alone and get out of here. All right, let's go. All right, bye. Enough with that face! What about getting down? Aren't you busy? You are getting off here, aren't you? Cut it out, let's go. She's odd. Am I to pull you off by force? She must have gone nuts. Of course, of course, you wouldn't want to go back here. Going back home, then? Bye. Hey, where're you going? - We'll leave her here, right? - Let's beat it. At first, everything went all right, but, then, it got pretty complicated. - I'll go check her out. - There's no need to. You fancy her? Sorry, but I have to go. - I've also had enough of this. - You leave. I'll go check her out. What a loss of time... You don't have to! It might turn out ugly! I know! If it does, I'm off. Hey, listen, can you walk? You have a strange face. What?! I see everything clearer. I'm feeling better. Go now. Yes, I'll go. All right. I'll report you to the police. - Yeah?! And what'll you tell them? - That you have raped me. Great. That's what I wanted to hear. I give myself up. My name is Umezawa Taeko. My name is Ken. - Are you a student? - Well, not doing anything right now. - Thanks to you, everything is clearer now - What is? Myself. What are you doing? It'll be a success! It blows out in two seconds. I did it! - What are you doing?! - I did it! Diamine, it was a success! - He's my older brother. - What was that noise? He wants to build bombs to throw them into the rapid transit. - Those ones? - Yes. Is he a terrorist? Yes. It's useless telling him it's dangerous experimenting here. "This is the invention... .. of a new model of... ...of dynamite, full stop. " Revolution! Terrorism! It will be a hit! I must hurry. I'll take out both the rapid transit and the army. We'll win, we'll win. I must hurry. It'll be a hit. I'll make tons of it. Long live blanquism! Long live blanquism! Long live blanquism! What did you mean when you said you then saw everything clear? I was referring to myself. After the rape, I saw everything clearer. Saw what? It's stupid, but I'm talking about myself. Oh? You mean, about being a woman? Well, you've said it also. Women, when fucked, become a container. Of course, isn't that true? The one fucking and the one fucked become one thing and only one. Do you really think that? Of course! All right, I just wanted to hear that. Because that's the way to do it. I've made up my mind. I'll become your container. Do yo like me? Well... yes. You too. It's the first time it happens to me. - What? - No, nothing. I'm pregnant. Aren't you feeling anything? I asked if you were feeling anything. - Where's the guitar? - I've lent it to Piko. - He might not return it to you. - It doesn't matter. I really don't know. I've never been raped. Liar! There's a rumor you were raped in that toilet. You're wrong! That's not how it was. I felt like doing it then. I had fun. - But, that's not always the case. - Well, of course. And then, what do you feel? How could I explain to you? Then, in the piece for "Underground", about women always expecting to be fucked, that actress' confession saying she wants to be fucked, is bullshit? That was only a media stunt. So, you want to be fucked. Moron! It's not about fucking or getting fucked. It depends on the moment. All right. This doesn't turn me on. - What should we do, then? - We should try a little. Let's go. Are you going to do it? What're you doing? - Get in! - Cut it out! No, what're you doing? - You said we should try a little. - We're doing it for real. - You're hurting me and everyone can see us - Let them. Stop it, you're hurting me! No, no! Pay attention at what you're feeling. These are in the way. They're expensive knickers! Don't tear them! - Stop fooling around! - It's for real. Right now the Red Army is uniting the people. Among the missions of the revolution... .. arming the people... .. it's not only for shedding blood. With the violence... .. subverting the ruling classes! In the battles, winning decisive victories! We must maintain this line of action. Because we must clarify the direction of the coming third attack. Express your intentions. The anti-riot police that talks about public scandals... "CRAZY STUDENT RIOT" "FIRES, RAIN OF STONES" Damn, I wasn't ready in time. Taeko! Taeko! Taeko, get up. Quickly, Taeko! What is it? Look at this. I had almost done it. Who are you? He's a friend of mine. Shame on you, Taeko is my sister! Sneaking in like this! I didn't sneak in. Get out of here! - All right. - What got into you? Look at this. Just a little longer, and my dynamite would have been useful. There'll be other opportunities. We'll create them for you. Really? - I'm sorry for intruding. - Hey, wait. I'll be back soon. - Are you running away? - No, your brother told me to leave. No, he only did that because he's tired. I've really felt great, I'll be back soon. I... I'd like to talk to you. What about? I'd like you te experiment something with me. Experiment? Experiment what? It's something I have to do. She really is strange. These two are crazy. Oh, hello, how are you? I'm sorry if I always make you worry. Thank you for having come to see me today. Allow me to carry this. Please, this way. Please, come in. Father... Thank you for lunch. Mother... Thank you for having made tea. I, in this cramped and dirty room, I'm shedding tears of joy. Look at that broken kettle. There's not even one fascinating girl in Tokyo. Oh, I'm so unlucky. I yet don't know what love is. So, since I've been living alone, I embrace this picture, I lick it. I masturbate. I masturbate. You understand, right? You have understood, haven't you? All the same, this solitary endeavor is sad. Very sad. Infinitely sad. Vane, vane, vane. When everyone is still sleeping I put my running shirt on, all wet from the day before's sweat, and I run in the morning mist. So cool! Fantastic! Others find me cool, but I am sad. Sad, sad, sad. Oh, why am I running? To meet someone? Well, I run. I run smiling. To run, to run. Morons have died because of exhaustion. But I am not like them. Don't count me in, I'm different. Totally different. I'm different. How should I put it?... The human being... How should I say... It's sad, sad, sad. Oh, I don't know. I wouldn't know. It's so sad, sad, sad... One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two... C'mon, raise your knees. That's the way, well done, mother. Move your arms! Yes, like this. Good. Move your arms. The hips, great. That's the way, well done Life is long, or is short. Who wants it short, let him proceed. Father, mother, forgive this youngster's rudeness who pretends to teach you something. Please. Forgive me. All right. We'll go on with it. One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two... Come on, move your arms. Father, mother... Even if I'd tell someone, they wouldn't understand. Have you seen Gaira and Obake? If they come, tell them to wait for me here. They won't be coming for some time. - Why? - They can't come. Are those two playing rape again? Come closer. No, cut it out! Let me go! Be a good girl. No, let me go. I don't want to. It's a transvestite! How mean! - Stop! - Wait, bastards! - You feel like joking? - Morons! Clowns! Let's go! Yes, who is it? Oh, it was you... Yes, excuse me. Are they in here? Come in and see. Then here you were. I was looking for you. - It's from yesterday's protest? - No. Not exactly. - It's because of a girl. - You shut up. That's the truth. After we split, we wanted to try another rape. But that fool called her friends and we got clobbered. That whore. Really?! We wanted to show her what one feels when raped, - and here's what we got. - Good work! - Don't laugh. - And you, did it work out with the girl? Oh, yes, that's why I was looking for you. I was with her until a little while ago. - Did you comfort her? - No need, she's a cool broad. She asked me if we'd all go to her place tomorrow. C'mon! She can't be wanting us to redo everything all over! Yes, that's exactly what she wants. - That's a trap. - You're wrong. She's fun to be with. As a matter of fact, we have to go there because... "PROTESTS IN SHINJUKU. SEDITION CRIME COMMITTED" "574 PERSONS ARRESTED" She wants to organize a plot. She'll call a couple of striking students and test them. Test them? She slept with all of them. Like I suspected. But what are we supposed to do? If you look, you'll understand. Tell us why are we here. We should be at the activists' reunion. Yes. We have no time to lose. I'm aware of that. Tell us why you called us and no pretentious shit. - Of course. - He's right. I agree. I'm pregnant. I intend to keep it. That's why I want to pull out from the fight. Patience. - Congratulations. - Isn't there another reason? - You aren't really pregnant! - It isn't a lie. There's rumor you were raped by the boys from the athletic club. Has it got anything to do with this? Not at all. Now comes the funny part. Let's go. I like you all. That's why I had sex with all of you. I'm pregnant in three months only... .. and there's still time to take measures. But I want to give birth to it, and I'll be needing money. To raise it. I want one of you to be its father. - and provide for it. - That's absurd! True! Only one can be the father. He should take it on himself. - Do you know who is the father? - Yes, I do. Ask him then! I'm off. Wait! I know who it was, but now I want to decide who'll be the child's father. That's absurd! It's already been decided who is the child's father. No, it's best I decide that. Enough! Look everyone. That's me. Inside me, there's the baby. So, who wants me, will take me right here, right now. - He will be the child's father. - You're even doing striptease. You're obscene! You're crazy! We're leaving. You're men, aren't you? How about doing it again? Please. Who wants to come over? You were really expecting to beat it? - Do you want to force us? - Yes, with this. Maybe, you don't like using violence? Then, we'll use violence. All right. What should we do? She's expecting you legs wide open. Fuck her. You? You? You? Or you? I don't feel like it now. You aren't revolutionaries in this? I'll show you. This is no mis-en-scene. If you can't be violent ina situation like this one here, - how'll you be able to make a revolution? - It's not like this. How are you, then, using violence? Certainly not in this situation. You don't know how to answer! You want to make sex only with words? Why don't you do it? - Are you doing it for real? - Yes. I'm happy. He's begun doing it for real. - Yodare! - I want to do it. "GO FOR THE MILITARY COAT" Who are those ones? I've already seen them somewhere else. Heil, Hitler. - Who are they? - Who knows. - They are Japanese. - Japanese? When I come to Shinjuku, I always see strange people. I've already seen them somewhere else. Heil Hitler. Maybe in "Heibon panchi". Heil Hitler. Such stupid impersonations. Let's go! Sex is fantastic! It's nothing new! I am sex in person! - Then, who was the child's father? - My brother, really. What?! You did it even with your brother?! But the doctor told me I wasn't pregnant. Everything's illogical. Where're we going? I want to do it with everybody! With whom? At least with Michiko. Fantastic! - THE END -
