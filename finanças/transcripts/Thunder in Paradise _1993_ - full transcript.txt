Mark. Monitor transmission's clear. Circle detection, clear. [Snorts] Sinuses clear. I told you to warn me before you sneeze. Roger that. Incoming. Ah-choo! I'm sorry. ♪ Thunder ♪ ♪ thunder in paradise ♪ ♪ thunder ♪ [Both speaking Spanish] [Laughter] [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Coming up on 2 miles to Cuban waters. Mark. Let's see what you're made of. Computer: Auto pilot engaged. This should be a night rescue. You're worrying again. The stealth will work. It will work this time. I guarantee it. Their radar will not see US coming. The only thing I'm worried about is whether you're gonna see anything coming with that eye of yours. I can see better with one eye than you can see with two. Oh, that why you saw kawalski's fist coming at you, when he sucker punched you. I'll take care of kawalski when we get back. Don't worry. An eye for an eye. Computer: Stealth engaged. Yes! We are undetectable, my friend. And 3, 2, 1. Entering Cuban waters. Mark. [Beeping] Ha ha ha. Nobody sees US. No radio transmissions about US. Nothing. Nada, niente, ningún, zip. Working, as guaranteed. What are you doing? Guaranteeing your guarantee. [Speaking Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] [Clears throat and sniffs] Computer: Stealth malfunction. Status, radar vulnerable. What? This sort of thing happens with prototypes, you know. I told you. I told you. Stealth is not an easy thing to maintain, my friend. Aw, damn! Ok, I screwed up. All right, I'm sorry. We'll abort the mission. No, we won't. Spence, there are a lot of angry, die-hard communists out there with large automatic weapons. And now they know we're coming. I promised palma we'd get his wife and son out. The entire Cuban army is about to go on full alert. It doesn't matter. If they're caught, Castro can use them to force palma back from the states and execute him. We pick up Mariel and Alfredo as planned. Spence... I should know better than to argue with you. All right, let me get you some satellite help. [Indistinct shouting] [Shouting in Spanish] [Bell dings] Come on. Come on, sweetheart. Come on. Computer: Satellite lock completed. Aw, there we go. [Computer beeps] Ha ha ha. Computer hackers, they're nothing. Like gnats on an elephant's butt. Satellite hacking, that is the true test of skill, my friend. Not just getting in, but getting in control. Yeah! [Computer beeping] How do you eat that stuff at a time like this? Complex carbs. Kick in like rocket fuel. [Computer beeping] Yes! There it is. Puerto manati, our destination resort. You see those soldiers? Thunder will lock in to anyone who fires a weapon at you. Thunder will lock in to anyone who even points a weapon at you. Like in those toothpaste commercials, you know? Where the fluoride zeroes in on the plaque and the tartar. It's an analogy. Just let me know if the plaque and tartar are hiding on my blind side. You got it, bro. [Beeping] [Shouts in Spanish] [Indistinct chatter] Spence. Spence, buddy, mucho activity out there. You sure you want to go through with this? Just cover me, bru. Don't blow your nose. Ready for launch? Ready. On my Mark. And 3, 2, 1, launch. [Gunshots] [Man shouting in Spanish] Ahh! [Gunshots] Hurricane! No! [Yelling in Spanish] [Speaking Spanish] Bru, take over on remote. I'm going in. You got it, brother. [Beeping] Thunder: Radar locked. [Beeping] Spence, make it snappy, man. We got a whole flock of Soviet-made werewolf gunships headed our way. E.t.a., 8 minutes. [Man speaking Spanish] [Grunting] Aah! Hey! Bru, draw their fire. What the hell do you think I'm doing? [Man yells in Spanish] [Woman speaking Spanish] Thunder: Proximity warning. Spence, they're on the street to your left, approximately 20 yards. There's an overpass 10 o'clock. [Men speaking Spanish] [High-pitched beeping] [Men speaking Spanish] [Gunshots continues] Mariel, stay close to me. Is my husband safe? You're husband's ok. And you'll be together soon. Let's go. Come on. Thunder: Targeting. You shooting at me? Well, chew on this. Uh! [Screams] [Screeching] Ba-boom! Ha ha! [High-pitched beeping] [Women scream] [Gunshots] Spence! Spence, buddy! Lots of plaque and tartar on your blind side. Got it. All: Whoa! Bru, send trigger. Come on. You got it, Roy. Trigger heading back to you. Come on. Come on. [Man speaking Spanish] Hurricane: Stay low. Hold on. Get them out of there. I'll cover you. I'll pick you up outside of the bay. Thunder: Target locked. [Beeps] Aah! [Indistinct yelling] [Speaking Spanish] Ahh! Mariel and Alfredo strapped in tight? Done deal. Autopilot off. Thunder: Verified. How do we look? See those gunships? Like a sitting duck. But wait till they see what comes out of this Mallard's tail feathers. They won't pursue US past Cuban waters. Let's breathe fire. Sounds good to me. [Beep] Full thrust commitment on my Mark. 3, 2, 1, Mark. Thunder: Hydro-thruster malfunction. Malfunction. Aw, come on. [Beeping] Aw, come on, baby. Forget I called you a prototype. You are the real deal. Their missiles are armed. They're going duck hunting, man. [Indistinct chanting] Yeah! [Engine accelerates] Ha ha ha. Just like our old Navy seal days, huh, partner? You bruise 'em, I lose 'em. Hey! Announcer: Continental airlines flight 597, from tampa to Houston, now boarding at gate 12.

I could use a cold beer. And some hot gossip. I need a back page for tomorrow's edition. I'll get you the cold beer, Max. Hey, Kelly, Kelly, come on. Around here, you know who's doing what to who. Give me a taste. Point me in a direction. Ok, Max, for a fellow new yorker. Ok. Ha ha ha. You see that guy over there, the one with the two gidgets? [No audio] Edward Whitaker. His step-brother's family built the hotel. When he died last year, he left it to his daughter Megan. So Megan's his niece? There you go, but Edward was executer of the will. Now he's going around saying there's some kind of clause that gonna allow him to take over the hotel. If what I hear about Megan's true, he's in for one hell of a fight. What do you think i'm telling you about it, Max? When you write about this, you got to take Megan's side. Or I'll poison your beer. Hey, Kelly, I'm impartial. So what do you prefer, arsenic or strychnine? Ha ha ha. Used to ride horses, you know, along these beaches. I don't think they allow it now. Uh, cheers to you both. Thank you, Heather. Thank you, Aaliyah. Mmm. I've know I couldn't trust you, since I was 6 and caught you with your hand in my Halloween bag. I was merely making sure there were no razor blades in it. Squid. Hag. Snake. Witch. Rat. Lovely ladies, excuse me for a moment. I have some family business that needs attending to. But we'll continue this... Later. You're disgusting. You're upset. What's this about you taking over my hotel? I was merely honoring the terms of your father's will. You swore to me you'd never enforce that clause. Ye--yes, I know. But the more I pondered it, the more I realized that your dear father put it there for your own good. And I promised him I'd look after you. Ha ha ha. I am not going to let you sell off this hotel to some corporate chain who'll squash it's history into a brochure. It's going to stay in the family. And that's what I promised my father. Then you should've honored the terms of his will. They were very explicit. I still have 2 days. Ha ha ha. Megan, it's too late. The clause is very carefully worded. There's no possible way that you could get married in the next 48 hours. Let's not argue. After all, we're family. That's a birth defect I'll have to live with. [Cheering and clapping] Ahh. Want to see your dad? Hop on up. Señora palma, watch your step. Way to go, partner. All right, man. Ha ha. Whoo! [Laughter] Hey, hurricane. Not a scratch on you. Ahh, the mission went perfect. Hey, bru. Hiya, sweetheart. This one must've been a piece of cake. Walk in the park. A day at the office. A stroll on the beach. Uh... A um... Buzz. Buzz. Both: You lose. So how's your eye? Ahh, it's a lot better. Can I see it? Naw, you don't want to. Yes, I do. Ew! Does it hurt? Can you see? No, it's ok. Give me 5. Keep the change. Ha! You know, after they turned down my idea for thunder, I decided to leave the Navy and build her myself. Is that when you talked bru into designing the systems? Yeah. Our Navy seal team threw US a going away party, got me totally drunk, and shoved me in a tank with a shark that hadn't been fed for 3 weeks. Ew! What happened? Well, the shark opened its mouth real wide and went for my side. Ew! But I slipped behind it. Then I grabbed its dorsal. It whacked me with its tail. And we flip flopped all over the tank. Wow! Then I got my hand inside its Gill, the other on its dorsal, and I yanked as hard as I could. What happened then? Well, you know that sound that velcro makes when you rip it apart? [Imitates ripping sounds] Ecch! Blood and shark guts everywhere. And something else... What else? What? A human hand! [Yelps] Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ever since then, I've been filleting my own sharks. You never know what you'll find inside the belly of a beast. Ha ha ha. Let's see what's inside our little friend. [Squishing] Yuck! Whoa! Ha ha ha. Must've been a small car, huh? Ahh! Uh! Whoa! The more junk they eat, the better they taste. [Grunts] [Squishing] What's that? [Water running] Oh! Wow! Looks like a necklace or something. Here, a present from me and the shark. Thanks, hurricane. I got to get cleaned up. I'll let my buddies fillet this thing. Come on, let's fly to the scuttlebutts. Fly? What do you mean? Fly. [Laughter] Wow, that's cool. Whoa! Ha ha my uncle's serious, Kelly. He plotted this entire thing. Waited till the last minute. I should've known he'd try and steal my hotel away from me. He's not gonna get it. Hey, what's the matter? Max, I need your camera. [No audio] Hurricane: Whoa! [Laughter] Uh-oh. I thought mom would be inside working. Don't worry, Jess. You're with me. She knows you're in good hands. R.j. Spencer, you are the most reckless, irresponsible juvenile delinquent of a man I have ever met in my entire life. You lead a sheltered life, what can I say? Jessica, please, go and wait for me inside. Where did you get that necklace? From Spence. It's brass. It was inside of a shark. Don't worry, it was dead. You gave my daughter something you found inside a dead fish? Mom, he washed it off first. I'm sorry if you think parasailing is too dangerous for Jess. Next time, I'll ask your permission. See you later, squirt. Ahh! I was hoping you'd be here. How's it going, Nicole? Hmm. Never had a better day, hurricane. Why don't we go lay this down by the dunes and I'll show you how exciting a parachute ride can be. Ha ha. Lead the way. Ah, my lovely mercruisers, you performed exceptionally today! But as for the rest of you, I'm disappointed! You have been a very bad boat. You think you can show me a little glimpse of your abilities and then cover 'em up? Well, let me tell you something, my friend. There is a reason that I graduated first in my class at m.I.T., there is a reason that I was the sole designer for the r-15 systems for the Navy, so if you think you can humiliate me in front of my best friend like you did today, you are sorely mistaken, do you understand? Huh? Huh? Hello? I can't hear you! I hope we don't have to have this discussion again. And now, Time to bond. Gotcha. [Whistling] Hey, Spence! Missed a good workout, brother. Wow. Beautiful day. Hey, buddy. They made their decision. Huh? They made their decision. Who made what decision? The Navy. They gave the contract to a company with a similar prototype. What? No, no, no way, there's nothing similar to thunder. Let me see this. You know what this is? This is the government. This is the government keeping those big, dinosaur, bilge-builders in business. It's all political economics, it has nothing to do with the best design! This really pisses me off. I tried fighting the system, I lost. You what? I lost. You what? How can you just say "I lost" so calmly? You sunk everything you own into that boat! You're in hock over your eyes! Which is very high. You got bank loans lined up like dominoes, one to pay off the other to pay off the other, without the chance of a contract, brother, they're gonna foreclose on you. They already have. The bank's repossessing thunder next Friday. Oh, boy. There's gotta be something we can do. You know, I can't remember a time when I wasn't fighting. For something, against something, I think I'm finally punched out, bru. Punched out? Punched out, bro. I'm sorry to hear that. Aw, bru! Aw, god, you hurt me, bru! Aw! Ohh! Bru! Argh! You all right? Yeah. [Both laughing] You dog. Hey, bru, I'm sorry. Oh, all punched out, huh? I think not. I think we're just holding ourselves back. Don't do it, bru. Oh, you bet I'm gonna do it. Don't get me fired up, I'm all tired. Get you all fired up, you all tired, man? You listen to me, brother, we put too much blood, sweat, and tears into that boat to just lie down. If that was your son, would you let somebody take him from you without a fight? Huh? You're doing it. You're damn right I am. Oh, hey, I didn't even have time to tell you. Guess who's over at the scuttlebutt? Name Kowalski ring a bell? Now do you want me to go there all by myself and tell that cheapshot artist that you're all punched out? Kowalski? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. You bet I'm sure. You sure? He's bragging how he turned hurricane Spencer into a little puff of wind! He's saying how you're a summer breeze! He's saying how you're a little mild spring Zephyr! This is a nightmare. What are we going to do? Well, this was from my fourth husband. He was my very favorite. Lola, a ring on my finger is not going to fool uncle Edward. By itself, no. Megan, dear, how much are you willing to do to keep this hotel? What? Well... Maybe there's someone out there who's just right for you. Marry someone by Saturday? But who? R.j. "Hurricane" Spencer. I am desperate, but I am not that desperate. When a man gets a woman as hot and bothered as Spence gets you, he's not just pushing the old buttons. He's turning you on. Besides, Jess is gonna have to like this guy too. Yeah, Kelly is right. And Jessie's crazy about Spence. There you go. Are you both insane? Besides, the one thing that r.J. "Hurricane" Spencer like more than that monstrous thunderboat of his is his precious freedom. Wrong! I happen to know that r.J. Would give up his freedom long before he'd ever give up that boat. Oh, I love that wicked smile. You know something. Brubaker will tell me anything I need to know to get me to go out with him. Let's just say Spence is on the hook. All we gotta do is reel him in. No! No, no, no, no, no! Meg! No! Hyaaah! You lost, so gimme that money! [Crazed laughing] I'm the champ! I'm the best! What are you looking at? Do you think that's funny? I'm the champ! I'm the best! What's wrong with you? Well! What is this? Cyclops! Come on, get a piece of me, baby! You want the money, chump? Hah! A cyclops! You want me to poke your eye out? What do you want? You want a piece of me, chump? An eye, for an eye! In your face, baby. No way. No way, I can't do this. Oh, remember the hotel? All right, you go. Spencer. There is something I would like to discuss with you. Shoot. In private, if you don't mind. I'm dressed, I'm ready, I will be there in 5 minutes. Thank you. Look, what's this all about, 'cause I'm running a little late. Seems you're running late on a lot of things. How far behind on your bank loan are you? If I'm going to put up the money, I need to know how much it's going to cost me. Why would you put up the money for my loan? How much? $93,000. All right. I might be willing to put up that amount. If? If, you... If I...? Marry me. Say that again? You have to marry me. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You're willing to pay me to marry you? If you don't get the money, you lose your boat. If I don't get married, I lose my hotel. I thought you were the hopeless romantic who'd never marry for anything but true love. And that is exactly what I'm doing. Don't look so smug. I love my hotel. And I'm even willing to marry you in order to save it. Beggers can't be choosers, huh? Desperate people do desperate things, huh? How does marrying me save your hotel? It fulfills a condition of my father's will. I have to be married within 36 hours. It would be a mutually beneficial business arrangement, that is all. So, do we have a deal, or not? I'll let you know. When? Hey, gin and tonic, please. I mean, first the stealth malfunction, then I couldn't maintain full thrust commitment, it's-- well, commitment's a tough one. You know, I feel like this whole thing is my fault. How so? Did I ever tell you that Spence saved my life? Took a bullet in his chest that was coming at me. That bullet would have killed me. Now, I don't know, I feel like I'm killing his dream. Well, everyone has a dream that'll never come true. Do you? Tell me your dream. No way! Aw, come on. Tell me your dream. No, it's-- stupid. Besides, it'll never come true anyways, so-- tell me your dream, and I'll tell you my dream. Come on. Talk to bru. Ok. Ever since I was a kid, I wanted to go to Italy, to Florence, and apprentice myself out to an artist, and sculpt nudes out of carrara marble. Like Michelangelo's David. There is nothing in the world as sensual as running your hands over the contours of the marble. Closing your eyes and feeling the smooth, cool texture, it's rough-hewn strength. I told you it was stupid. No! No, no, not at all. It was, it was, um, listen, if you ever need a model, I could-- well, what's yours? My what? Your dream! My dream? Oh, you, oh, my dream! Um, oh, it's, um, it's similar to your-- I mean, it's not about marble or anything, it's, it's about, um, a real-- woman. Actually, it's about you, Kelly. I dream about the two of US, connecting. In a, uh... Conjugal kind of way. Well, there you go. Like I said. Some dreams will never come true. Bad day. Ok, you got a deal. Let's go somewhere where we can work out the details. Not just yet. Here. Take the ring! Propose to me. What? Ask me to marry you. Now? In front of everybody? You can get on your knees if you like. Don't push it. My uncle has eyes everywhere, the more people that witness this, the better. So do it properly. Marry me. Louder. Marry me. Louder, with feeling! You want feeling? You want louder, with feeling? Marry me! I can't keep my feelings a secret any longer. I want everyone to know how much I love you, how much I need you, how I can't live without you. Put me down. I was stupid not to say yes when you begged me to marry you a month ago. I hope it's not too late! No! No it's not! Darling! And I love you too. I can't believe it! I can't believe it, Spence is gonna be my dad. This is what I've always wanted! Hey Spence, I can't believe this! [Applause and cheering] Woman: All right. Ha ha ha. Man: Get your stuff stowed away. [Grunting] Easy. Easy. Man: Got room for 2 more? Second man: Yeah, 6-foot pallets... Ok, merremoto, do your stuff. [Muttering] [Indistinct chatter] Man, I'd like to keep one of these suckers for whaling. Spot a humpback off the starboard, poof! Ha ha ha. Launch this thing into his back. [Imitates bomb blasting] Kablooey. Ha ha ha. Man: Hey, Dave. I got 6 more for you. [Bell dings] Go ahead and move that hatch over. [Bell dings] I think this looks pretty good if I do say so myself. Why don't you take a look and tell me what you think. We're on the last crate. Should be ready to weigh anchor before dark. Hoo-ah! Oh, Mr. Kilmer. I would have never recognized you. Heh heh heh. Yeah, she did it again. Look, these clients are going to have to wait a couple days for their weapons. We got a little business here we have to take care of. Things are still pretty hot in town. I mean, after that little thing we pulled off today. Well, last place they're gonna look for US is at the paradise beach hotel. Won't take long, just make sure you keep all the men on the ship. Yes, sir. So tell me, baby, why is this little girl so fascinating? Ohh, it's not her, it's this. Her necklace? Many years ago when I didn't have any money, I worked on a trawler for an ex-convict. We headed to one of these islands out here, which only he and the captain knew. They got drunk one night, and they showed US a necklace-- 4 strands of square brass beads. He graphically described cutting somebody's throat for it, said it was the key to a fortune worth millions. Before we got to the islands, we went down in a storm. The convict drowned, so'd the captain and everyone else, except me. And here it is, right here. Found in the belly of a shark. [Chuckles] But how is it worth millions? Well, baby, first we have to get it. Mm-hmm. And then we will find out. Hurricane: Hi. I love you. I love you. I love you. Mm-mmm. [Sighs] I love you, darling. [Hums] Darling, I love you. And I love you. Ahh! I can't do this! Oh, come on, Spence. We didn't even get to the kiss. Brother, brother, brother, relax. If you can't convince me, how you gonna convince 200 people down there? Should I be wearing sunglasses, a patch? I think my eye's getting better. What do you think? Let me see. Yeah. Yeah. Looks pretty good. Now, listen. Did you take care of business? Soon as we tie the knot, huh, Megan pays off the loan. My main man. Yeah. Heh heh. How about community property? Community what? Property. Spence, community property. After the two of you are married, everything you own becomes half hers, including thunder! How'd you handle it? God. I didn't even think about it. Well, you better think about it 'cause here comes the hot kiss at the end of the wet fist? What the heck does that mean? [Doorbell rings] Ah, saved by the bell. Community property. Hold that thought. [Door closes] Nicole. Nicole. N-N-Nicole. Nic--guess who? I heard the unattainable's about to become attained. I had to come and see with my own eyes because, ugh, I just could not believe it. You're not alone. How's it going, Nicole? Well, I'm depressed! What can Megan Whitaker give you that I can't? It's complicated. [Sighs] Well, the least I can do is kiss the groom. Mmm. Mmm. [Door opens, closes] Ha ha ha. Megan. Megan! You know it's very bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. It's even worse luck for the bride, Megan, Megan, to see the groom before... The...wedding. [Sighs] Perfect. Yeah. Ah, now, honey, don't go getting jealous. I was just giving him a little something to remember me by. If you're not out of here in 5 seconds, I'll give you something to remember me by. [Chuckles] That's... Your honeymoon starts getting boring... You know where to find me. She's a charming girl. I know what part of your body's done the thinking until today. Community property. But starting here and now, you better use your brain. We need a prenuptial agreement eliminating community property. If my uncle is here, and if he proves this is a marriage of anything other than true love and devotion, quote, unquote, we both lose everything. I keep what's mine, you keep what's yours. So you better make this convincing. He's working on it. We have a lot riding on this, the both of US. Don't blow it. She didn't hear a word I said. You know... [Sighs] You're one hell of a negotiator. Matches your eye. [Scoffs] [Indistinct chatter] Welcome to the paradise beach hotel. Wait for me on the north side of the hotel. All right. [Tropical music playing] [Scoffs] [Sighs] Please, uh, join hands. Marriage is a blessed event, a bonding of 2 souls in celebration of their deep... About community property. I don't want any. You're not getting it. ...of beauty and strength. It's only 50%. I want controlling interest of thunder. Drop dead. 51% or I'll walk and you'll have nothing. And neither will you. A ribbon of love... Without leverage, I'd have nothing anyway. Do you, Megan Irene Whitaker... I'll say no. You're bluffing. Try me. ...to love and to Cherish till death do you part? I do. Uh, do you, Randolph... On one condition. I want 51%. Of the hotel? When hell freezes. Of the starboard. ...Cherish till death do you part? Never. Then I'll say no. You wouldn't dare. Leverage works both ways. Ohh. I do. Uh, good. And if anyone knows of any reason why these 2 people should not be married, let him speak now, or forever hold his peace. This marriage is a deception and a fraud! Woman: What? It's based on commercial enterprise, not love. And I shall reveal it as such. Finish the ceremony. And, um, uh-- oh, the ring! Uh, do you have the ring? Psst. Here. Now, uh, repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed. With this ring, I thee wed. I know pronounce you, uh, husband and wife. [Wedding march plays] [Applause] [Blows nose] All you got to do is bring her to me on the beach. All right? Hello, little girl. You look lovely and what a beautiful necklace. May I look at it? Yeah. It came from inside of a shark. Ohh. Really? You know, I bet you would like to know where it was before it was in that shark, hmm? Do you know? No, no, no. I don't, but my husband does. He's a jewelry expert, so why don't we go show it to him and find out. Hmm? Ok. [Indistinct chatter] Who's your little friend, honey? What--what can you tell this little girl about her necklace? Well, we're gonna have to get a closer look. Let me see. Well, that's-- let me see. Brass beads, about 10 years old. Afraid it's not worth very much, but I'll give you $20 for it, all right? That means it's worth a lot more. [Laughs] She's pretty smart. You're very smart. Ok. $100 for it. No thanks. My dad gave it to me, so I'd never sell it. Bye-bye. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Now, that's special to you, is it? Yes. And you don't want to lose it? No. It's a little bit loose. How about if I tighten it for you? Will you turn around for me? Yeah. Thank you. My necklace! Jess, what's wrong? They stole my necklace! Stay here. Aah! Hurricane: Give me that necklace! Unh! Lola: Aah! Uhh! Go down there and take care of this guy. Uhh. Aah! Why'd you steal my daughter's necklace? Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Uhh! Break his face. Uhh! I need the beads. Hurry up. Uhh. [Grunts] [Screaming] Come on, we gotta get out of here. Gotta get the beads! [Groaning] We gotta go. [Screaming] [Screaming] Let him go! Mom, bru, help! Jessica! Hey. [Grunting] [Groaning] Over here. [Grunts] [Screaming] Get the beads! Let's go, boss. Hey, there they are. Come on! Terremoto, move it! [Groaning] Man: Get those guys! Dad, are you ok? You all right? I think so. Take it easy, brother. Any breaks? I don't know, man. But I feel like I just fell off a beanstalk. [Tires squeal] Who was that? What was that? They took my necklace. It's scattered everywhere. Bru, get a metal detector. Yeah, yeah. Ok. Got one. Way to go. All right, so the necklace is a puzzle of some sort? But that still doesn't explain why those awful people wanted it so badly. When we solve the puzzle, maybe we'll find out. Got another one. Way to go. Unh. Darling, it's late. We really should go. Jessica! What? Oh, sorry. I thought you were talking to Spence. Heh heh. Well, it's your guys' wedding night. Got one! So did I. Wow. Maybe it's a happy face, the eyes and mouth. No, I've seen this before. It's a map. [Coughing] Oh, those are islands off sarasota. My father used to take me fishing there. [Snaps] You're right. I know. Here they are. [Horn honks] That's bru and Kelly. Let's see what they found out. The necklace was probably made by a convict named Andrew "the gimp" gilmore while he was a prisoner at San Quentin. That's what the s.Q. Stands for. Prisons stamp every bullet so they can trace which guard fired 'em. Heh heh heh. She's a pistol, isn't she? Check it out. "T" 3, tower 3. "Y" 4, yard 4. There you go. So who was gilmore? He was convicted for masterminding a $3 million robbery 20 years ago, but the important thing is, he was also the prime suspect in over a dozen unsolved robberies. Biggies. Museums, diamond brokers. Did they ever find the loot? The loot? The haul. The Booty. The plunder. The goods. Spoils. The swag. The stash. Did they ever recover any of it? No. And here's the topper, the gimpster was murdered in the prison's craft shop after making a necklace out of bullet casings for his wife. That necklace was never found. So maybe gimpy stashed his loot on one of these islands. Bingo. But there's no "x" marks the spot. Yes, there is. There's a map on this side, too. For god's sake, Spence. Will you give me a little room here. Oh. Hey, check it out. There is an "x." Hurricane: Get thunder ready. We leave first thing in the morning. Hurricane: No. Megan: Yes. Forget it. I'm coming. You're saying. I am coming. I said no. I said yes. I said no. Absolutely, I am coming. Ah. I am coming because bottom line is I now own 51% of this boat. All right already. You can come, but no bickering, no bellyaching, and no back talk. I give the orders and you follow them. Understood? Aye, aye, sir. And when you're through stowing this away, I got some more stuff for you. Why does he have to be so churlish? Churlish? [Laughs] [Imitating Megan] Oh, Spencer, why do you have to be so churlish? [Bang] [Sighs] [Engine revs] Get in. Let's go. Come on. Aah! It's not fair. It was my necklace. I should have gotten to go the island, too. Hon, life ain't about what's fair. It's about who wields the power and 9 year olds don't. Well, that's not fair, either. Well, if they were going on their honeymoon, you wouldn't have gone. Kelly, bru wouldn't have, either. Don't bet on that. Well, maybe doing something exciting together will make them really fall in love. Well, what do you mean, Jess? They're already married. Why does everybody think I don't know what's going on? I know they got married because of grandpa's will and uncle Edward. Well, so how do you feel about that? I feel like Hayley mills in the parent trap, except there's only one of me. But that should be enough. Pssh. More than enough. Come here, you. Hey! Slow down! Come on. Ooh! Put me down! Put me down! Thank you so much. This is a beautiful drawing, Jessica. Thanks for solving the puzzle for me. Set course. Latitude, 52 degrees south. Ha ha ha! Longitude, 78 degrees north. [Clears throat] There it is! Heh heh! Where is it? Right there. There's the island and the boat. All right, get the men, get the weapons, we're going ashore. Let's do it. Oh, yeah. I'll show you some thunder. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Let's do this! Hold it down. I got it. Pull it all the way up. Man: Look alive, men. Ha ha ha. Yeah! Watch your back. Move in. Bru: You know, I kinda feel like we're on a family outing. It's around here. It is over there. No, I'm telling you, it's around here. The "x" was clearly marked on the map in the middle of a pond or lake, and we passed a lake way back on the other side of the island. [Whistling] Enough of the love spats, please. I'll tell you what, Megan. Join me on the rock over there for high tea. Thank you very much. You're welcome. She's your wife. [Sighs] Oh, god. Now what's he doing? Looks to me like he's climbing a tree. Get up. No. Get up! Get your own rock. Whoo! "X" marks the spot. Oh, I found it. Oh! [Grunts] That's it. Spence, we got an opening, buddy. Megan: Push! Push! I can't. [Grunting] Come on! Come on! Push! Wow. Megan, the lake. Hurricane: Here come the backpacks. Ok. Whoa. Cool. Send 'em down. Ahh. Uhh. Ahh. [Sighs] And the misses? Ok, I got you, hon. I got you. I got you. Right here. I got you. Come on down. Come on. [Whimpering] I got you. I got you. [Grunting] [Coughing] I got you. There you go. Clear the rope. Whew. Wow. Whoa. Heh. [Megan coughing] Oh! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Oh, god. Oh, yuck. Oh, god! Ouch! Ow. Uhh. Yuck. Aah! [Weeps] You're not afraid of snakes, are you? I just don't like disgusting things crawling up my leg, that's all. I'll keep that in mind. [Imitating Megan] Oh, Spencer. A moment of your time, please. [Normal voice] Check it out, my friend. [Hurricane laughs] [Laughs] Bingo. [Laughs] [Laughs] Oh, man. [Grunting] Yes. Oh, man. Oh, man. Ooh, that's heavy. Oh, boy! Oh. Night before Christmas. Pretty smart of the old gimpster. Heat sealing 2 rafts together to make a giant waterproof baggie. Oh ho ho. Oh ho ho. Ha ha. That vault. Oh. Oh, man. Ho ho. Oh, man. [Grunts] Oh, man. What is it? Whoa, Spence. Before we begin, I just want to say I'm very excited. Ha ha ha! [Gasps] [Gasps] Oh, my god. Ho ho ho. Oh, my god. Pearls. Ohh. Money! Ha ha ha. Who said crime doesn't pay? [Gunshots] Drop your weapons. He said drop your weapons. Now! Can't anybody listen to me? I said drop your weapons or your bride's gonna be your ex! That's right. Drop your weapon, bru. Drop the gun! Good. Now... Put all your weapons in the dirt, stand up slowly. Man: Ha ha ha. Yeah. We got 'em. We got 'em. Good. You're supposed to be this great commando. Do something! Think you could take her with you when you leave? I don't wanna separate the newlyweds. I'm violent but i'm not cruel. Am I cruel? No. Besides, I've got her daughter and her maid of honor at our ship. What? How the hell do you think we found you? [Laughter] You son of a-- if you hurt either of them, I swear I'll find you and I'll rip your heart out through your throat! Ouch. [Laughs] Now! You, woman! Move here! Move! Your body now! You two. In the bag. The jewels, the money, the diamonds, the keys to your boat, put 'em in the bag, tie it to the rope, send it up! Uh, you don't wanna steal our boat. Is that right? Shoot the woman. Ok. All right. Now put your guns in the bag slowly. [Gunshots] I said slowly. Let's go. Come on. Come on! That's right. Nice and easy. There you go. Huh? Watch those fingers on the triggers. [Laughing] Come on up here to papa. Come on. Get the rock and seal the hole. Now. Everybody. It's like this, big man. Your wedding vows? "Till death do US part." [Laughing] Hold your breath! Great. Great, great, great, just great. Well, guess what, folks. We ain't getting out the way we got in. Where is--there's got to be another way! We've got to get out of here! Don't worry, we'll get Jess back, trust me. Well, I don't think our friends are going to be needing their boat anymore. You want me to take it for a test drive? Why don't we all take it for a test drive? Spence. Salt water. Oh, man, what a great boat. Yeah, for water skiing. Thunder: Your weight and activity do not match those of authorized personnel. Enter identification code now. Man, this is a hell of a boat. Thunder: Identity not verified. You have 20 seconds to leave this craft or enter proper identification code now. 20 seconds, or what's it gonna do, kick US off? [Laughing] Thunder: 10 seconds. Argh! 5 seconds. [Yelling in pain] 4, 3... Come on! 2. Final warning. One. You got an attitude problem! We're going back to the ship, we're gonna put a line on it, and we're gonna tow it out of here. Let's go! What are you doing? He's oxygenating his blood. This pool leads to the ocean and when Spence finds his way out all we have to do is follow this. How long can he stay under there? Don't worry about it. He's part whale. Bru! [Gasping] There's a way out. Megan, you just have to relax. Remember everything I told you. When we get in the water, start your deep breathing. When I give the signal, take a deep breath and we'll all go under. Well, it'll hold enough air to get US through the cave. If there's no leaks. Let's do it. Calm down, Megan, do it for Jess. Hey, Megan. Piece of cake. Three deep breaths, we go under together. Ready? One. Two. Three! Haul up the anchor! [Choking and gasping] Are you ok? Yeah, I'm ok. Spence. I can't get any support unless I turn on the engines. We'll have to make do. Well, can't you just radio the coast guard? No, no, they'd see 'em coming miles away. Be too dangerous for Jess and Kelly. I'll bring her back to you. Be careful. Bru: Do me a favor, will you? Bring Kelly back, too, 'cause I'd like a shot at my own honeymoon. Or a reasonable facsimile. Get thunder ready to breathe fire. Already on it, brother. What are you doing? A little psychological warfare. Gotta hand it to you. Earned my respect. I'm...stunned you're here! Jess: Daddy! You got what you want. Let US go and we'll call it even. Doesn't work for me. Tie him up, it's time to feed the sharks! Jess: No! Kelly: No! Jess: Dad! Aw yeah, Navy seal. How about Navy anchor? Jess: No! Kelly: Please, stop! Man: Shut up. He's ready, Mr. Kilmer. Go ahead and kill me, but let them go! Shut up! [Protesting] Now, once and for all, good-bye. Jess: No! Get him out of here now. You can't be serious. No! Stop! What's that? Bru! Damn, damn, damn! Well, what was-- it's Spence! Bubble, bubble, bubble. Let's let 'em all be together. What? It's nothing personal, it's business. Come on, let's go. Now. What? No! [Screaming] Bon voyage! No! No! [Gurgling and grunting] Ohh! Jessie! Aah! [Splash] Aah! [Splash] Jessica! No! Ohh! [Coughing] Ohh...baby, baby. Are you all right? Ohh! I was so scared! It'll be all right. I got her, buddy. What are you doing? I'm givin' you mouth-to-mouth. I don't need mouth-to-mouth. Oh... Thanks, bru. Spencer, i--i don't know what to say. You'll think of something later. Bru, strap 'em in. Remind me to save your life more often. [Computer sounds] Let's get that line secure. Weigh anchor. Aye, sir. We're to set course to Panama. Heh heh heh--yes, sir. Hurricane: Hold on tight. Ok? Jessica: Are you gonna give thunder full-thrust commitment? Let's hope so. No problema, brother. Visual onscreen. [Engine revving] Hurricane: Get ready, we're bustin' loose! W-W-What!? Who's in the boat? Dooh! I don't believe this. Break out a stinger missile and blow 'em off the planet. Ha ha ha! Now! Come on, come on, go, go! Come on! Grab it. I got it, I got it. Let's go! They're gettin' away! Now! I got it, I got it! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! Fire! Come on, baby! Thunder: Missile launch. Impact... 15 seconds. Commencing full-thrust commitment. Thunder: 14... Do it. 13... Thunder: Hydro-thruster malfunction. Damn! 9... 8... Not again, not--argh! Thunder: Engaged. 3...2.9... 2.8... 2.6... 2.5... That stinger's gainin' on US, Spence. I want it to. 2.1... What goes around comes around. 1.9... 1.8... 1.7... Wh--what's it doin'? Thunder: One second... What's it comin' back here for? Oh, man, oh, man! All right, all right, get out of here! Ooh! [Screaming] Thunder: .2... Impact imminent. [Laughing and yelling] Whoo-hoo! Radio the coast guard. Tell 'em they can fish some barracuda out of the water now. Spence, what about the treasure, man? There's always another day in paradise. [Laughing] Whoo-hoo! Darling, what's taking so long? Wow, you look incredible. You were incredible today... Darling. How would you like some champagne? Maybe later. Great... [Moaning] Darling... You bungled it. They discovered your device. They know... My devices have never been discovered. Ohh, ohh, ohh! Ohh, ohh... I said "fake it," not "make it. Move your hand. You know, it's kind of a shame that your security sweep turned up old uncle Edward's handiwork. You never know what real passions might have flared. Lola, would you leave Ms. Larue and I alone for a moment so I can show her some of my handiwork. You never know what passions might flare. Lola, stay where you are. Spoil-sport. Ha ha ha... Well, even though they out-smarted uncle Edward this time, he's not gonna back off. Neither am I. Ohh--ho ho ho. How about a little gratitude for saving your life? If you hadn't given Jessica that necklace in the first place, we wouldn't have been in danger. Darling, I love you, and I'm so glad we're finally married! [Moaning and grunting] That's no act!
