Laetitia! What now? We played all the games. Me and Liv are getting along great. We've bonded. Jeane's a crybaby. I know how to talk to them. - I'm fed up. - Come here! See the onion? We get along great. You're ok... Stop screaming. Look at the sausage! Give me a kiss, Laetitia. You're ignoring me. I can't take it anymore! Get dressed somewhere else. Don't just shove a bottle at her. I've got it under control. Get dressed. We'll look out the window. See the sky? It's not very nice out today. Ok, silence... I'm leaving, girls. You need to be nice. Laetitia, watch us make a big silence. We're going to make a big silence. Let's go back over there. Mom's going to work. You're communicating your stress to them. Fuck off! Never kiss up to kids. They should kiss up to us. Enough now. Calm down, Jeane! I'm afraid she'll hurt herself. Calm down please. This isn't working. You're a good girl. Bit of a suck-up, but nice. Cigarette? Shit, we're out. I'm going to get ready. Jeane make an effort! I can't do this. Please stay calm when I leave, girls. Don't break down like last time. Gimme a kiss. A little peck. Another. That's better! Much better. Another. Another. I love your kids, they're great! I think... we make a great family. Can I help you? Yeah, I'd like some flowers. Roses or something. Roses? For love? White ones are for friendship. Orange roses... are for warmth. Love and warmth. Right, orange roses are for... warm love. Past or future? Future. I'll take the orange roses. Three euros each. - I'll take... - How many? - I've got ten euros. - That makes three. Kinda pathetic, no? Not much volume. - How much is that? - Ten euros. Can I see it? Plants are nice. - They last. - They last longer. Can I see? - Do you like it? - Sure. Is that Marc? Marc, come here. Let me show you real quick. These are the girls. Jeane and Liv. Come here. Are you listening? Pay attention. The bottles have their names on them. So you use the right formula. My phone number, if there's a problem. Look! And emergency numbers. - Got it? - Yeah. Hold her like this. That's not how you do it. Virgil! You need to hold her better. It's going to be fine. You're stressing her out. Take good care of her. Don't worry. She gets scared, she's sensitive. Let me finish, you're bugging me. Ok? I'm trusting you with her, be careful. Hold her right, watch her. She needs help. She's tired, understand? Go on, you'll be late. I'll show you. Don't cry. Hi, there. I'm Marc. I'll be watching you today. You and your sister. You'll be fine with Marc. You'll be fine. Marc is nice. Laetitia? You piss me off! Do you happen to have paper dragons? Or paper tigers? What's that there? A dragon mask. Can I see it? Thank you. - How much? - Fifteen euros. What do you do for real? I'm in cooking school in Caen. Studying to be a pastry chef. - Really? - Yeah. What do you make? Lotsa stuff. Flan, chocolate cake... - That's not great. - With the jacket? Let's see. Try something else. Pastry is a childhood dream... - Gorgeous! - It's ok? Cookie! Makes me wanna... Wait, wait! Here, baby. Let me zip you up. What a handful! Hello? Can you hear me? I'm downstairs. Can you come down? Are you crazy? What are you doing here? I came as planned. I bought gifts. I even bought you flowers. We could see each other first. I'm happy to be here. This is ridiculous, I'm downstairs. What you're doing is twisted. You ok, Laetitia? Very, very twisted. Laetitia, I... Let me zip you up. You ok? - Forget it, I'll change. - Hang on. Vatsana, sorry to bother you. I'm fine! You? Yeah. Come in. I'm so sorry about this. I need another favor. Vincent's downstairs. I have to go to work. The kids are alone with the babysitter. He's kind of a novice. I'd feel better if he had your number, in case Vincent comes up. Which I don't want. - No problem. - Really? - No problem at all. - Cool. How've you been? - Fine. - Are you sure? Gotta run. Sorry to impose! - Drop by when you have time. - Promise. Hey Arthur, Vincent again. What's up with your voicemail? I'm in trouble here. I came to see my kids. Laetitia's stopping me again. Is there anything we can do? I really need your help. I'm at a loss here, Arthur... Dammit! This is a message from Vincent. I'm in deep shit here. I just left Laetitia's. She's fucking with me again. I don't know what to do. I need your help. I'm in the street here. It's Vincent again. Sorry, it keeps cutting me off. Marc, you need to know... There's a little problem. Vincent, the girls' father, can't come up. He wants to, but he can't unless I'm here. - Understand? - Yes. This is important. He's dangerous, violent. He can't come up. I warned my neighbor Vatsana. Call him if you need to. I'll give you his number. He's right below. My cell phone... Shit! Shit, I'm so late! My ride's downstairs. I'm writing Vatsana's number on this pink post-it. - Ok? - Yeah, yeah. Don't go out, don't let anyone in. You've got it, right? Yeah, yeah. See you tonight? - What? - See you tonight? You're like glue. Wait one sec, I'll come down with you. - My ride's here. - One sec! Gimme a kiss. Wench! Marc, I gotta go. Help yourself. There's ham, vegetables, cheese, bread... You can make sandwiches for the kids. Ok. Bye, Marc! Bye, kids! Bye. We're on our way, Carole. I know, I know. Yeah, be right there. AGE OF PANIC Can you get this off me? Hurry up! Mr. Jack Lang, are you confident? Confident, serene, combative. Thank you. Solferino is turning into a veritable hive of activity... - I have to work. - Just a picture. Great, thanks! There are already hundreds of people behind me. Nearly a thousand. Shouting, "Fran?ois for President!" "We will win!" Socialist campaigners are giving their all to the last moments of this battle. In a few short hours, the results will be in. Stop crying, it's pointless. Mommy! Stop crying, it's stupid. There! All fresh and clean now. Here we go. Cute monkey. Nice monkey. Damn this thing! Easy now. Careful. Keep rocking. You're ok. Hello? Dang! Calm down. Come here. Hello? Calm down. I'm calling Mommy. Hello? It's Marc. I'm calling to tell you... Everything's fine. I just wanted to let you know... Someone keeps calling. They've been calling for a while. When I pick up, they hang up. I can't do much from here. Unplug the landline and stay inside. Stay inside, ok? My earpiece! Emilie, it's Marc. Marc. Your babysitting gig is weird. I'm not feeling it. The kids' dad, Vincent, is outside. Staking out the building. He keeps calling and hanging up. Be quiet, Jeane. Calm down. Calm down, Jeane. Everything's going to be fine. I'll put on a movie. Everything'll be fine. What brings you here? What brings me here? My friend Remi. These are my first elections. I didn't vote. I'm not French. I'm Swedish. In Paris for three years. What do you expect to change? A lot of things. Renegotiation of the Sarkozy-Merkel treaty. Right. And you? More social rights. Less discrimination. A bill for gay marriage. Fiscal justice. What's your friend want? What do you want? A new deal. Will Fran?ois Hollande win? I hope so. For his values. The values he represents. Feeling confident? I'm quite worried. - Are you an activist? - What? You're the scum! Yeah, right! You're the one we should deport! I never got violent with you, sir. Get lost with your rightwing bullshit. You're as arrogant as your asshole Sarkozy. We don't get around in borrowed yachts! But sir, we earned our money! What's going on? That guy's totally wasted. What's up? Shit! What happened? Be right there. Shit! Gotta go to UMP headquarters. Noemie got attacked Whose food tray is this? Come get it. Yeah! Everything ok? All is well, they've calmed down. We got the teepee out. Great. Gotta go, Marc. I'll call you later. Great. Bye. Nicolas! Nicolas! Be nice to your sister. Don't hit her. Come on. What's wrong? Why can't I play? Careful. Yes? It's Vincent. Yes? I came to see the kids. Will you let me in, please? Just a second. Just a minute. Open the door! I'm not supposed to let anyone in. I'm not anyone. I'm Liv and Jeane's father. Jee-Jee? Can you hear me? Tell the man to open the door. I've got a letter from the judge. I bought presents. - Alright ok. - Sorry. Sorry... Recognize me? Hi there! How she's grown! Yeah, well... Can I have a kiss? Jeane, give me a kiss! Look, I bought you some presents. Come give me a kiss. Come on. Come here. Look at all the presents. Look... Look. See this? It's for you! Give me a kiss. How does this work? Look. Look! Look, look! Look what I got you. Jeane, look. Look. Open it up. See that? Look at this. See it? Hey, Vincent. How's it going? Fine. You? What're you doing here? I came to see my kids. Can I get some coffee? How about I get you some coffee in a cafe? - Ok, Vincent? - See all this? No, I want to stay a while. Please, Vincent. I'll put this here. I bought presents. - This is for Laetitia. - Vincent, please... I'm talking to you. You let the kids run around barefoot? That's how I found them. - What? - That's how I found them. They shouldn't be barefoot. Careful. Thanks. Vincent, listen to me... You wanna give him a toy? She's giving you a toy. You have no right to be here. Give him the toy. Give him a kiss. - Listen to me. - Is he scaring you? You have no right to be here. - If you two need to talk... - Let's talk like adults. Go have a talk. You can come back after. - You don't get it. - You're scaring her. I'm not scaring her. I'm not leaving. I'm staying here. Vincent... You don't get it. Come with me. You don't get it. I'm not leaving. - Sorry - Don't make me... insist in front of the girls. Be reasonable. Let's go outside. Put her down. Let's talk. - No. Don't do this. - You shouldn't be here. Don't touch me when I'm holding my little girl. Don't do it, ok? - Calm down. - I'm totally calm. Don't do it. Don't touch me when I've got her. I'm not. We're just talking. - Chill out, I'm trying to help you. - I'm chill. Don't do it. - Marc, put their shoe on. - Ok. They need them. - Put this over there. - Listen to me. Take the baby, Marc. Don't bribe them with treats. They're not animals. What're you doing, Marc? Take the baby. Vincent, listen. What's with you guys? I'm sorry about this. You know you can't be here. Let's go outside, Vincent. Take the baby, Marc. Vincent, listen. - Hang on. - Vincent, listen. I've got a letter from the judge. Doesn't matter. Leave. You leave! I have a letter. Please, Vincent. - Seriously, Vincent. - Sorry but... Vincent, come on. - You're making me anxious. - Come on. Read the fucking letter! - It's none of my business. - Not in front of my kids! - Right, calm down. - Hands off! - Let's go. - Who d'you think you are? You need to leave. Calm down. Fuck this shit! Nicolas! Nicolas! Fuck the Left! Socialist scum! To arms, citizens! Form your battalions! March on No impure blood... Does Sarkozy still have a chance? I think it's very simple. Kids play with Legos. They build skyscrapers. They play storekeeper. They sell things. Kids never play civil servants. They never play political commissar. They never... They never play teacher. Kids are proof that human nature is fundamentally right wing. I agree with Sarkozy's ideas. He's done so many cool things to move us forward. And the Left is so lame. Mr. Hollande thinks he'll lay down the law at the G8 summit and make Obama and the others change their minds. But he's wrong They'll eat him alive. The European Union will eat him alive too. Mario Monti Mariano Rajoy and David Cameron don't agree with him. He'd be eaten alive. He thinks we live in a bubble, but we don't. We live in a global world. We have to move with the times. Hi, Laetitia? It's Marc. I just wanted you to know Vincent came by. What? I told you this morning! No, no, I... I didn't let him in. I called Vatsana like you said. I explained it to you! Where is he? It was Vatsana... I called Vatsana. He told me to let Vincent in. Vincent came up and so did Vatsana. Vatsana kicked Vincent out. They argued and Vincent left. Where's Vatsana now? Is he with you? No, he left. He had to go somewhere. Are you three alone now? Yes. This is bad. Bring the kids here. Come right now. He'll be back, I know him. Take line 6 to Montparnasse, then line 12... to Solferino, ok? Do you hear me? - Is this a bad time? - Hey, Vincent. - Am I bothering you? - No. Didn't you check your cell phone? - I unplug it on weekends. - Right. Work's been crazy, I'm wiped. I told you, I work at a law firm, but I'm not a lawyer. Yeah, but you know the penal code. You can give me advice on what to do. When I got there I called Laetitia. I wanted to do things right. I wanted us to talk first. Like you said I should. I called Laetitia. I said let's get a coffee, then see the girls together. She was totally hostile. She called me twisted, asshole... There you go. - That's it? - Yep, that's it. I did go back an hour or two later. I had some presents, I wanted to give them to the girls Some guy, the babysitter or something... let me in. He was harmless. Was Laetitia there? No. Apparently she'd gone to work. Even though my visitation had been arranged. - What's that? - A letter from the judge. Give me that first, for chrissakes! Sorry. You're wasting my time. Still feeding him tranquilizers? No, and she's a girl. It says I'm allowed to see them today. "The father is granted 1st weekend visitation rights beginning in May, provided their mother is present." - You should see Liv! - Let me read. You should see Liv. You'd fall in love with her. "Saturday and Sunday, May 5th and 6th." That was yesterday. Your appointment was yesterday. Saturday and Sunday, May 5th and 6th. I couldn't make it yesterday. It's very specific. You can't mess around... I had to be somewhere. ...with the judge's decision. I had to be somewhere yesterday. I called Laetitia and told her I couldn't come until today. - Did she say that was ok? - I left a message. So there you go. - What? - You fucked up, simple as that. lit says the father's visitation rights begin on May 5th at noon. This is a specific legal point. If you don't show, message or no, you're in the wrong. She probably called the judge. Or she will, and she has a right to. I'm just explaining it to you. I understand. Thanks, Arthur. - So, what? - It's complicated. The neighbor came? - He threw you out? - In front of my slaughters! That's not cool. Arthur, can you imagine? He threw me out in front of my girls. How am I supposed to act? What can I do? All I can do is suck it up. If I get upset, they call me insane. You did right. You gotta help me, Arthur. We have to fight back. We can't let... I have to prove that no, I am not insane. She's up to something. It's twisted. Emilie, it's Marc I'm taking the kids to Rue Solferino to find Laetitia. I need you to meet me there. It's kind of complicated. Avoid Rue Solferino, too crowded. Instead we'll meet... on Rue Villersexel. Villersexel with a V. The corner of Rue Villersexel... We live in Paris, fortunately. Everybody's going to Solferino. I don't care. I'm not going. - Why? - I hate socialists, I hate people. You can't hate people. Today is historic! Arthur, it's historic. Get over yourself. How much are lawyer's fees? I'll pay you, I need a lawyer. How much? You need a lawyer to advise you. To advise me, and support me. You can't buy someone to do your bidding. No, to speak for me. You do realize I have more experience than you in this area? Obviously! I'm more objective about it. - Why are you debating me? - I'm not. It's a beautiful day. You're white as a pill. You'll get some sun, see pretty girls. People will be in a happy, loving mood. Bring your dog. Maybe she'll meet a nice male. - What's the hurry? - My kids! Think we can fix it there? No way! You'll make things worse. - Listen... - Imagine the hellish crowds! What if you couldn't see your dog? Leave her out of this. She's old, she's tired! You'd feel lonely too. Stop it! I'm on your side, I get it! You'd feel empty too. - Leave her alone! - I will not. How would you like it if I did that to you? You're a jerk. - See how pissed off you are? - You bet. So you know how I feel? Stop. You're jerking my chain. - So you get it? - Stop. - What if I move her? - Cut it out! Cut it out, she's not a pillow! You'll know how I feel when... Cut it out, I empathize! I get what you're saying. You're pissing me off. You're freaking me out. Stop it. See how crazy it makes you? You're the one making me crazy! Sorry... It's hard to manage with two kids. You're here, Emilie? He can't manage, all alone with two kids out here. Sorry, I called Emilie. It wasn't planned. I'm not sure it was a good idea to bring the kids here. Don't worry. Take them to Rue Solferino. There's a bar called Le Solferino. If there's no room, wait outside. Fran?ois for President! We will win! In 30 seconds I'll be talking. - You'll see when I start talking. - Ok! - I can't hear you. - Nothing? Turn it up. Louder. I'm blowing out an eardrum. All I hear is static... The atmosphere here is incredible. We could do a traffic report! Crowds are spilling over onto Boulevard Saint Germain. The crowd is ecstatic. When we're on the big screen, everyone cheers! Flags are Waving, as you can see. The crowd is very young. Careful, a lot of people are walking by. Don't move. Careful. It's very crowded. We are France. I am not running for just any office. I'm running for President of the Republic! Shit! I need to send a text, honey. Stay right here. Nice! Good ambiant music. I don't know... - Then why'd you call Vatsana? - Laetitia said to. Are you retarded? You just blindly follow orders? If I say, "Get naked and run through the crowd," you do it? - No. - Then why'd you call him? Don't you have your own will? Your own mind? What're you doing here? - Didn't you move south? - Yeah. I went for 2 months. Been there a year now. Weren't you going on vacation in Quebec? No plans for that yet. Stop saying you don't know! You're a broken record! This is serious, dammit! Stop calling me stupid. It's stupid to bring babies into a fucking crowd! - She told me to. It's not my fault! - It's dangerous! They're your kids, not mine. They're your kids! Don't blame me! When you need cash, stop babysitting kids! Find another job! Stay away from babies! This is a big fucking crowd! - This is serious, dammit! - It's not my fault. Could you watch her for a sec? Be right back. Sorry, it's just... Stay right here, it's very crowded. Be right back. The crowd around me is growing impatient. Everyone is anxious to know. The suspense is mounting. All eyes are on the big screen behind me. The socialists boo when they see Nicolas Sarkozy, and cheer for themselves. Fran?ois for President! - Let me hold her. - It's too crowded. - She shouldn't be here. - He's taking her. Hollande, get to work! This is crazy. - Jeane's over there. - Careful with my daughter! Go over there. Calm down! It's hard, I know. It's tough on you. But calm down. Calm down. You'll be alright. Are you alright? I'm in a spiral. I feel really anxious. It's ok, I'll take Jeane now. You ok, Jeane? Look who's here. - Sure you can manage? - Yeah. - You'll be ok? - Yeah, thanks. How you doing, Jeane? Let's sit down. How you doing? I can't breathe. - Go home and rest. - I'm in a panic spiral. Go somewhere and chill. I gotta go. Carole, I've got a big problem, I need a minute. How long till the next live feed? Ok. No, sorry, night. 29, 28, 27... Our new President's face is about to appear on screen... 13, 12, 11, 10, 9... 8, 7, 6... 3, 2, 1... Laetitia, can we talk for a sec? Please? - Just for a sec. - I can't. Give me just one second. Have a heart. If there's a problem, talk to me. Don't call the neighbor. Something wrong here? I'm working. She's my wife. Hands off, she's my wife. For real, yeah. Where are the girls? This is scary. Look at this crowd! It's terrifying! They're safe, don't worry. I can't talk now. She brought my kids here. They're in the crowd somewhere. I'm freaking out about my kids. I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out. Why'd you bring my kids here? You can't be doing that! I'm freaking out! I'm having an anxiety attack! They're safe, I said! Is this live TV? Yes, we're going live. Let's do it. I'm ready. All around me, the crowd is delirious with joy. From Rue Solferino to Boulevard Saint Germain. Uncertain of victory to the end, everyone is now in a very, very happy mood. As you can see. Fran?ois is President! Fran?ois is President! No more Sarkozy! No more Sarkozy! This is the thrill of a lifetime! We're over the moon! Bravo, Fran?ois Hollande! Bravo and double bravo! I'll be asking you how you feel about the victory, what changes you expect, etcetera. It was a tough campaign. Excuse me... Vincent! Let her go. You're hurting her. Everything ok here? Fuck off! Stay out of it! Police! Are you and the baby ok? I didn't do anything! Handcuff him. Don't move. That guy's psycho. He's an animal, he jumped me. We'll talk to the couple, then file a complaint at the station. Think you're a vigilante? Avoid eye contact. I'm talking to you. Look at me Is your ex-husband violent? Has he ever hit you or the children? Once he hit my brother in front of the girls. He spent time in a psych ward for that. Do you wish to file a complaint? No, I just want him to leave us alone today. You can't sit here. You have to move. This table is reserved. I need it in 5 minutes. Are you from I-TV? - There's an I-TV table. - I'm with my kids. Give us 5 minutes. - You have to move in 5 minutes. - We will. - I have a table for journalists. - We'll move. You'll finish your drinks in 5 minutes? Give me your order. - I'll have a Perrier. - Coke for me. I had a big salad. And a steak. There's a good butcher nearby. They drink Coke now? Coke's not for kids. I need the table. Like I told you. Right now. I need the table. Like I told you. Move to the I-TV table. You bitch! - Sorry... - Pay and get out. I'll wipe up, I'm sorry. Pay at the counter and get out. - Got a rag or something? - Pay up. A punch or a kick... - Your brow bone seems fine. - I have to bleed? No, but can you think straight? Are you sure what happened? I don't think so. Listen, sir. I don't usually get attacked. - Exactly. - It's hard to think straight. So you're not sure? - Course not. - You can't remember exactly? He hit you, but maybe it wasn't on purpose? I don't understand what Marc, the babysitter, was Going at work with your ex. - That's what I'm saying. - It's crazy. - Totally crazy. - Yeah. And I'm a fool. - What? - I'm a fool. No you're not. It's the truth. The babysitter goes to work with her? She pays him to do that? It's dumb, I know. - And you're playing me for a fool. - No... Think about it, sir. We don't hire babysitters to go to work with us. Do you see a babysitter and my kids sitting next to me? No, that'd be weird. It's party time. One big party. - I know, it's weird. - Yes it is. It's crazy. I was totally tripping out myself. Were they having a barbecue or what? I have no idea! You have no idea? Then cut the crap about the babysitter. Tell me what you were doing with your ex and the kids, and why you punched Mr. Guilhem Amesland! I've got a letter. It says I'm allowed to see my kids today. This morning... Look, it's written. I know how to read, sir. I'm just pointing it out. Visitation rights May 5 and 6, with the mother present. She wasn't there. She wasn't there, but she was chasing after you? No this morning... - Forget about this morning. - But it's important. Let's recap the situation - I can explain. - I'm the one explaining here. You were arrested on Rue Solferino for punching someone. With a baby in your arms, a woman screaming for help, and a man trying to help. Only normal. You'd do the same if someone stole your kids. I didn't steal my kids. - I was supposed to see them. - In her presence! - In her presence! - She wasn't there. Right! She's there, she's gone... She's running after you, like magic! Is she David Copperfield? - I didn't kidnap my kids. - That's enough, sir! You're missing the point. Come in. He's not pressing charges. Ok, thanks. Let's wrap this up. - I've got a lot on my plate. - So do I. Then don't punch people! Let's wrap this up so you can get lost. Sit down, sir! I'm not through with you yet! I've had it up to my ass with humiliation today. Ms. Royal, how does victory feel? Change... Is now Change... Is now The Socialist Party is celebrating... We'll go, but you have to control yourself over there. It's super important. After what happened today, we can't fuck up. Are you prepared to trust me on this? - Do you trust me? - Yeah. Shit! I felt you steal it! I felt it. You stole my phone. Chill, chill! You're drunk. How could they, tonight? Tonight of all nights! My cell phone was stolen tonight! What right do you have to shove me? What right? Get lost! Don't tell me what to do, pal! Don't tell me what to do! They're arresting people at random? He didn't do anything! Let him go! Come down! Stay up there! - Come down! - Stay up there! The party ends on a bitter note, as clashes break out between certain individuals and the police, who attempt to maintain order firmly, but without incident. Hey, Laetitia! - Hey how's it going? - Great, you? - I'm dead. - Yeah? This is Chloe. Chloe, Laetitia. Drink, drink, baby! No drink for me. Fuck off! Do you speak French? Please leave my girlfriend alone, young man. - Ok, no problem. - Thank you. I find the human race pretty violent right now... Your imagination should serve as a vehicle to steer you away from violent spaces. Flush out the wounds. - Like a toilet? - No, like a cleanser of violent space. People complain that daily life is humdrum. But what is life, if not daily? What is it? Post-daily? Pre-daily? What you're saying is pretty fuzzy. It's not clear. Maybe not... But I think what you're saying shows lack of imagination. You're crushed by society's expectations. You have no imagination when it comes to life. We need imagination all the time. - Success doesn't matter. - You make no sense. I'm really tired. Seriously! I'm exhausted. - I don't mean to be mean. - I'm tired. I'm tired too. Stay with us. - Come on, Laetitia! - Goodnight. It's cool, I'm just very tired. Hi there. Were you asleep? No, I was watching something. It got pretty wild. Sorry about that. In any case, you were a big help. No problem, it's all good. Did the girls get to sleep? Yeah. Liv was wiped she crashed right away. Jeane took a little longer. Ok. Well, thanks. You were a great help. I hope to see you again, in better conditions. Yeah, for sure. Do you live nearby? Not really. I'm over by Nationale. Right, that's... a bit of a walk. Yeah. Thanks a lot. No problem. And... I'll see you out. I was just wondering, about the money... Shit, sorry! Is six euros an hour alright Sure. What time did you arrive? Around 1 pm I think. Ok. Here. What's this thing? A present Vincent brought for the kids. He brought you flowers too. Here. Let's see... Forty... Here. Seven more. That's all I've got. I owe you the rest. I'll call you tomorrow. No problem. - Thank you very much. - No worries. - Bye. - Goodnight. Thanks. You too. Who is it? Vincent. - Hi. - Hello. I'm Arthur, a friend of his. I came to ensure he sees the children in your presence. As agreed upon for today. You want to see the kids now? Don't talk to me. Talk to Arthur, my lawyer. And your asshole neighbor can talk to the dog! She's a girl. She doesn't bite. You want to see the kids now? - Don't talk to me, Laetitia! - I'm not. - Calm down. - Sorry. I'm here to ensure you respect the agreement. It was not respected yesterday or today. - It's 2 in the morning! - It's still the weekend. We must try to respect the agreement. I just want to see my kids, even asleep. I'm not wakin them up now. The judge's decision has not been respected. I'm representing Vincent here. You two have a communication problem. I'm here to mediate. Vincent, please. Before the judge, you both agreed to this decision. It wasn't respected. The letter specified the dates. Yesterday and today. Yesterday, Vincent couldn't make it. Today, it didn't happen because you weren't home. - Right. - You're at fault today. That's why we're here. I'm at fault today, and I'll tell you why. Yesterday, Vincent did not honor our appointment. Why? Because he's irresponsible. He didn't even call me. Why didn't you honor today? - So I'm not at fault. - Hang on. Don't get upset. Arthur's a lawyer. He knows the law. Stay calm, listen to him. - It's ludicrous if we can't... - Can we come in? Lie down. Can I come in? I just think it's important to try and reconnect with the spirit of that day you saw the judge. Find a way for the kids to see their dad. I know you agreed on that. - Yes. - Despite your past... Rimmel! He made a mistake by not showing up yesterday. You are also at fault. It was still the weekend, it still is now. Weren't you off work? Right, but I was called in! I was going to tell him, but he didn't come. We waited all day for him. Let me talk to him. He didn't come yesterday, so I couldn't. Today's the problem, not yesterday! Today you got the cops involved! - You harassed me all day. - C'mon! - You harassed me at work. - Cut the crap. - You won't get away with it. - Sue me! You're not stealing my kids! Right, wonderful! You hear me? I won't let you kidnap my kids. We're trying to establish rules... - I won't let you. - You're an idiot. You're an idiot. - I won't let you steal my kids. - Stop it. - You hear me? - How stupid can you be? Vincent... This won't work. I'll have to leave. If you insist on screaming at each other, fine. But you'll never resolve anything. - You won't lose them... - Unbelievable. You're saying I'm stealing your kids? You're saying I'm kidnapping your kids? Is that what you're saying? - Is it? - Yes. Then you're a stupid bitch. This won't work... I'm their father! So it's not kidnapping! I'm allowed to see my kids! Kidnappers come from outside the family! But I'm scare! You're scared? Me too! Because you're sick! - Hands off! - You're scared for your kids? That's enough. I've had it up to my ass! Shut up. You harass me at work. You're never here! You think your kids are toys. - Stop it. - Your kids are toys to you. - Stop it. - "Stop it!" Stop it now, ok? I have a right to see my kids! - You'll pay for that... - Stop it! You have no right to hit him. No hitting. This is getting ugly. You're a stupid bitch! I'm their father! They're my daughters! Ok? You don't bring infants into huge crowds! - On a side street - Bullshit! Shut up! You've got no excuse! No excuse! Shut the fuck up, both of you! - Sorry, Arthur. - Stop shouting. Listen to me. This is nuts! Don't give me that look. How dare you accuse him? Today, and for months. You're playing one hell of an ambiguous game. Why'd you get custody? He's violent? I'm not so sure! The law favors women. You're taking advantage. Listen to this - Right here. - Shut up. "Request to suppress father's visitation rights denied." Know what that means? He has the right to see them. He has visitation rights. - I know that. - Quiet. It's a basic, ancestral right. Get it through your head. You can't stop him from seeing his kids. You can't stop him. Sorry Arthur, but see how crazy she is? She's always pushing me to fuck up. She took my babies into a huge crowd. - Stop acting out. - I'm scared for my kids. Go over there, Laetitia. Let me talk to Arthur. - Don't order me around. - I'm not. Will you two grow up? Let me talk to you for a second. Your daughter is 2 years old! Honestly! You think she wants this thing? - This is embarrassing. - Why am I here There's no point. You're so nasty. Your mug is nasty. - My mug is nasty? - Totally nasty. Let me tell you... Know why my mug is nasty? 'Cause you harassed me all day long! You put the kids in a crowd Do you realize? - It wasn't planned. - They're babies! What if they died? Was that planned? Don't talk to me about plans! - Don't take babies into crow - I was afraid of you! You're sick! I brought present Stop doing your sick shit! Aren't you concerned that I'm more afraid of than having my kids in a crowd? - I'm so concerned. - You make me insane! Be afraid, be very afraid! - I am! - Be afraid of yourself! - See what's going on? - Yes, I'm here to help find a solution. A peaceful solution, not like this. - I know, sorry. - You're doing this! This silence is favorable to good communication. - You do know he's been committed? - Will you listen to him? Will you listen to him? - He's violent. - Think you can do that? Is there no way? No way at all? - My brother was hospitalized. - Shut your face! - Vincent, please. - You pretend to be nice. We were starting to get somewhere. Stop it, for fuck's sake! - No, not that. - Don't you hit me. Don't you hit me. No violence. Where were you yesterday? Yesterday? I couldn't make it, ok? Couldn't you call? Couldn't you send a message7 Is that too hard? I came with Arthur now! Couldn't you call me? You're sick! You're the crazy one! I'm crazy? - You harassed me at work! - Calm down. Yeah, 'cause there's no talking to you! Ok? Stop, dammit! This is ridiculous! - What? - This is insane. - Wanna tear each other apart? - Yeah. This is insane. As soon as it gets calm, you're at each other's throats. Sorry, Arthur. Go on, get it all out. No, hang on... I don't need some loser artist telling me what to do. Always in your little bubble! Drawing your little cartoons! I do something useful for the country. People watch me. They decide what to think, who to vote for. I help them understand. So don't criticize me. Don't look down on me. How sad, people deciding who to vote for based on your drivel. Come here... Da-da... Don't eat that. Come here. In music like this, there's always a happy part that totally sucks. - This part. - The music? I like it. But this part sucks. It's not meant to be just sad. Or just happy. It alternates. It's complex, totalizing art. Seriously. Think about it. Totalizing art? It strives for totality. In my opinion. The girls are getting spoiled. Look around. Toys everywhere. Who buys them? Do you buy all this stuff? You ok? Excuse me. Are you really a lawyer? - Almost. - You sure don't look like a lawyer! I'll have my degree soon. What do you ink you look like, Laetitia? Who is it? Who's Virgil? This is Virgil. Vincent, the girls' father... And Arthur, his lawyer. His friend. Evening, gentlemen. Evening. I've been out on the streets. Are we in the way, Laetitia? No, it's ok. I'm the one in the way. Here. - Beer, Arthur? - Thanks. Vincent, I'm so pleased to meet you. I really like your children, Liv and Jeane. - I know it's dumb. - Yeah, they're cute. They're cute. If one day you die in a plane crash... you'll leave behind two beautiful children. It must be nice to know you have two children in your life. I know it's dumb but I wanted to say it. I'm glad to know you. What the...? Laugh if you like, I understand Sometimes we forget the simple things. Are you in love with my kids or what? - Yes, I'm in love with the - Watch it. I haven't yet accepted the idea of a guy touching them. I don't touch them much. I'm not talking about a dad. I mean a boyfriend. Yeah, I know. It's a hen. I bought it for Jeane. Gotta be super careful. It lays eggs. Exactly the same size as... see? A tomato. Sure. So be careful. This is the first time I've seen you two together. It's beautiful. You loved each other. I know it's dumb. What business is it of yours? Seriously, I... I love Laetitia. Thinking of you two together makes me happy. You're a good guy. I actually feel intimidated, coming after you. It's always strange when two men who've shared the same woman meet. I'll walk the dog. Go ahead and laugh. Nice to meet you too, bro. - She needs a tree to pee. - Ok. - You don't mind? - No. You're very kind. Where are you going? The dog needs some air. You'll be nicer. You say that because you think I'm harmless? You think I wouldn't hurt a fly? No. You want Laetitia to be with a nice guy? I don't know. Concentrate, you seem distracted. You feel like... Laetitia needs a nice, harmless guy to look after her? If you drink the whole thing... Excuse me, you know it's. That's the biggest shot of vodka I ever drank. I need more beer. You'll puke if you keep that up. Wanna smoke? I've got pot. Wanna smoke? Smoke if you want to. No thanks. You know how it is with a girl. Virgil, excuse me. It's weird, the way you're talking to me. All these secrets. It's weird, I don't know what I'm supposed to say. I don't know if you live here. I'd rather Laetitia tell you about it. She won't tell me. That being said, I have no problem with it. I wasn't with her when you were together. It was much later. He fell asleep. Hey, no problem. No, but I wanted to tell you. We met later. Many months later. I have no problem with it, once again. No problem at all. That's not it. You should hear how Laetitia speaks of you. It's like she still loves you. I want you to know that. I feel no jealousy. None at all. If ever I change the diapers or anything, it's not like I'll be you. That's another matter. Stay out of that. That's the one thing... The one thing... you can't touch. The father thing. That... Liv and Jeane... I'm their father. I will always be their father. To the day I die. The day they die. I'm not taking your place. I know. That's why I'm saying, I like you. And that's why I'm saying, I don't want that to happen. I don't want to fall into some kind of mini-cynicism. With me here and all. I'm sorry... I'm here and it's weird. I'm sorry... I'm here and it's weird. See that wall? I'm the one who painted it gray. Your presence is everywhere, Vincent. No problem. I can't relax. I'm always thinking, "That belongs to him, he put that there..." Listen, Virgil. You can have it all. I could care less. All I want... is my daughters. I know that. I know. That's all I want. That's it. I know. Come on. All good, Laetitia? Yeah. Nice walk? I'm pretty tired. I'd like you to leave. Yeah, ok. Listen, it was a pleasure, Virgil. A pleasure. I'm off. Bye. Bye, Laetitia. Bye, Arthur. - Lose something? - I'll call tomorrow about the kids. Take care. Virgil... Bye, Vincent. Feels good. I waited all day. What? I waited all day to hold you like this. Feel your little breasts on me. Your smell turns me on. You make the sap drip from the plant. I'm the slave who harvests the sap and sprays the diabolical ointment all over my body. You're silly. You're more animal than human. You're one of those rare animals... with no pack. Most animals move in packs but you're all alone. When I see you, a fire rises up in me. Really. It's like you lit all my heaters. - You don't say? - It's only May and I'm burning up here. Hang on. Hang on! That's better! Give me a cigarette. Give me drag. Give me a blowback. That's so good! I'm so excited. I've never been this turned on. I don't even know how to act! I don't know what to do! Go for it! How does this thing work? Shit, fuck, shit! How's it work? It's easy... What's this leg? Not like that... Why do they use so many zippers now? This is impossible! Your feet smell so good! I wanna jack off to the smell! You spent the whole day sweating but you smell... like the Orient! She's pretty, but no picnic. She'll build a wall between you. - She's had it. - They're sick of us. We're too obnoxious. Totally. It's true. You really don't look like a lawyer. You know, Laetitia... She was right. You really don't look like an attorney. Miss? Does this guy look like a barrister? A barista? Do I look that young? I'm wondering if he could pass for a barrister. Could he pass for a barrister? A banister? Like on a staircase? No, the profession! The profession of barrister. Barrister is a job? Of course it is! You know, they defend people. They try to defend people. Like a lawyer? Right, a lawyer! Does he look like a lawyer? I don't know. You look nothing like a lawyer. I told you. You're a blank slate. Who would ever hire you? Aside from me! Asshole! Seriously... Seriously. Today I learned how hard you are to defend.
