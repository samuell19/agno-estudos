How much? Just for picking him up and making glue and soap out of him? What else do they make at the carcass disposal except glue and soap? What? Well, I know it! Yes. So shall I just ditch the vitamin pills that cost me 40 euros? Of course I opened the package. I gave him a pill right after we came to see you! In fact, his condition got worse. From your vitamin pills, doctor. Don't play me for a fool now! Your pills probably killed him! There you are. Anything else? - How much is it? - 7.90. - Eight euros? - Yep. Hello. 9.50, please. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. Sir? Do you need assistance? Two floor tilers. I need good and fast workers. - Two floor tilers. - Me! Me! Get out! Out! Excuse me, master. Excuse me. You need worker? No, thanks. Please, master. I am a good worker. I said: no, thanks. How much do you charge? You, per hour? - How much? - Eight euros, master. Seven. Six euros, master. - Three. - Three? Three is very little. I need to eat. You can post be that needy if you can afford a mobile phone. Five. Five euros, master. Three. Take it or leave it. All right, master. Three euros. Hold on. We are here. It's full of roots here. From this tree that was felled. I should have removed the stump ages ago. -Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes. Yes what? Yes, master. Hold on! What are you doing with the shovel? Remove the pick first! What do you think this handle is for? You have to take this out. Then put it here. Yeah, it's stuck. It got stuck in a root. It's 20 to eleven now. Let's say eleven. - Did you hear me? - Yes, master. So no haggling over the wage later on. Move it. Don't take root! Fix the pick and start digging. The other way round. The other... Give it to me now. Give it to me. Let me do it. Give it to me. You've never held a pick in your hands your entire life, have you? There. That's deep enough. Make sure the hole is closer to the stump. Yes, master. Don't leave the pick in there. Yes, master. With this mess, it's no surprise you get nowhere. Clear away everything you don't need. Hold the rest in your hands. Yes, master. - Quit calling me bloody "master"! I'm not your master. This is a free country. If you don't like it, you can leave. But I won't pay you for this little bit of digging. Don't look at me like that. When you start a job, you finish it. Only then do you get paid. You're holding the pick handle all wrong. You're making it more difficult for yourself. You'll hit a leg in your hole! Move your hand higher up. - Like this? - Yes, like this. - What? - Nothing. What's so funny? It's just because you said: "hit a leg in my hole." - What? - You said... If I, for example, hold the pick like this, I'll "hit a leg in my hole". I meant "you'll hit a hole in your leg", of course. - Where are you from anyway? - Afghanistan. I see. - Give that to me. - It was just a friend. I'm not paying you three euros an hour to chat. Give it to me. - I'll switch it off. - Give it to me, I said! - What? - Four euros. Are you crazy? If you want my mobile, then I want, for example, four euros per hour. I don't want it, I want you to give it to me until you finish your work. - You want to borrow it. - I don't want to... Give me your mobile right away or get lost. Go on, then. Go on, then. Beat it! Just get lost! What the... Are you crazy? Stop! Stop it now! I said... Enough! Stop it right now, I said! This is my hole. I dug it out. - And I can fill it in again. - Stop it, I said! All right then. Four euros. The mobile. Don't make a sound! And wait. So you're here after all. - Where else would I be? - Well, it's locked. I was wondering... - Whether I was dead? - Come on, Mr Senft. I'll take that. Thanks. Where's Argus? - He didn't come to say hi today. - Bye. See you tomorrow. It's not funny! What's the matter with you, Adib? Are you stalking me? Or did you call me accidently? You cannot hear me, can you? Adib, Habibi? Listen to me! I will tell you something. I love you! - Hungry? - Yes, please. Come and wash your hands. Sit down. Eat it while it's still warm. They cook well. Or don't you feel like pork? - I do, it's just that... - Are you a Moslem? - Yes, I am a Muslim. - Oh, of course. It's "Muslim". Well, I must apologise. - I also have beef. - You don't have to. I can also... - No problem. You just had to say. - Please. Really... - Can I just have... - I've got everything here. What's up? I thought you were hungry. Go on, eat. Can I have a fork, please? Thank you, master. Where did you learn such good German? Or have you been here so long already? No, I came to Austria only six weeks ago. I learned German in Camp Marmal. Where is that? In Afghanistan? Yes, master. It's a large camp near Mazar-i Sharif. - Camp? - Yes, master. What kind of camp? It's a military base. NATO. German and Norwegian. - And that's where you were? - Yes, master. Why? As a prisoner? No, master. First as a cleaner, then I worked in the kitchen. Then as an orderly assigned to petty officers and then as an interpreter for the orderly room folks. "Orderly room folks." I was in a camp once, too. What was your position? Finish your lunch. I was just... Help me down. What did I tell you about the tools? Now lift that. But slowly. Oh my! Like this. Just as I thought. Roots everywhere. - I couldn't get that far. - I can see that myself. Let it down. Hatchet. That's an axe. It's in the shed. Over there. Go on. Fetch it. And bring a small log, too. Get a move on! You... When I say "heave-ho", then you lift it. - As far as you can. Got it? - Yes, master. But be careful. I don't want the handle to break again. Heave-ho! Stop! Stop! Hold it like this. Don't let it go. Bloody, fucking, son of a bitch! Come off, you... Heave-ho! A Nordmann fir. A living Christmas tree. My wife wanted it. Bring the stump round the front. I'll get your money. You can go. No filling in? What? The hole. No. It's not dark enough. I'll do that alone. Is it for the dog? Yes. Was he old? Very old. Older than me. In dog years. Where did you hide it? I swear I'll shoot! Tell me! Where is my money? - I have no money. - Don't talk bullshit. Empty your pockets! Go on! Trouser pockets, too! Trouser pockets! The other one! What's this? What's this, huh? - These are my pills! - But I didn't take your money. Take off your clothes! I told you to take off your clothes! You... I swear I'll shoot you dead! Where did you hide it? Where? Where did you hide it? Take off your jumper. Take off your shirt. And your vest. Everything. Move it! Go on. Take everything off. Here. Oh my... Under the plates. It's all here. It was from eleven to five. Makes six, minus... Minus the lunch break, makes five. Five times three is 15. - Times four. - What? Five times four makes, for example, 20 euros. Of course. Sure. Times four. Makes 20. Right. Here. But don't spend it all on booze! - What? - My mobile. Yes, right. This is Samira. Please leave a mesage. Hey! Wake up! What's wrong with you? Master, I... I need, for example, just a place where I can sleep. For tonight. - You have a fever. - It's nothing, master. Just a hole in my foot. Come. Come. Come. Hold on. Now, come here. Put this under your arm. Where did this happen? On the road. And how long has it been like this? Two, three months. Give it to me. Let me see. - You have to go to hospital. - No. No, master. Not to hospital. I have no documents, master. Please, help me. Please. - Mr Senft. - Good evening, Dr Oppolzer. I'm so sorry about Argus, Mr Senft. But I won't let you insult me like you did this morning again. I'll take back the vitamin pills, okay? It's not about Argus. Okay? It's about him. What are you doing, Mr Senft? Showing you his wound. And what am I supposed to do now? He has to go to hospital. He can't go to hospital. - That's why we're here. - Mr Senft, I'm a veterinarian. He just needs proper wound care and something for the inflammation. I'd break the law just by examining him. So give me what we need. I can do it. I was a paramedic. Then you'll know what an anaphylactic shock is, won't you? I'm not helping you to give him the wrong shot at the wrong time. Take him to hospital or his leg will be the least of his problems. This is all I've got. 70. - 74. - You must be joking, Mr Senft. Where's the 20 euros? - Where is it? - You can't be serious, Mr Senft! Is that how you treat money? Here. Take it. - You didn't get me, Mr Senft. - You didn't get me, Doctor! He is staying here. -Give me the bloody medication! - Mr Senft, let me go. Let me... Mr Senft, you'll hurt yourself. Don't you pass out on me now! Mr Senft... Mr Senft, stay with me. Hello? Come. Come with me. Sit down. Easy now. Sit down for a minute. Come. All right. Take your time. Here. - Here we are. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Nice and easy. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - There we go. Very good. Okay? - Thanks. - Better now? I'm... I'm fine. Alright, Mr Senft. Let's call an ambulance now. Okay? Emergency call centre. - Dr Oppolzer, Mareschgasse 49A... Hello? Hello? Are you still there? Hello? Drink a little more. There you are. What are you doing here? Hey. This is the wrong street. Thanks for taking care of him. - I didn't know what to do with him. - Look. I've got everything we need. What's up? - Do you need any help? - No, thanks. Come now. Please. Don't say a word. Good evening. Your vehicle registration papers, please. You do realise why we stopped you? No. Why? You're driving without lights. Your lights are not switched on. Oh yeah. Thank you, officer. Oh my! What's wrong with the gentleman? - He feels a bit sick. - Your ID, please. - He had one too many drinks. - I didn't ask you. - Your ID, please. - HQ to car 37. Over. - 37 here. Over. - Do you speak German? A 107 in Mareschgasse 49A. Ground floor. Turn off the engine and step out of the vehicle. - The ambulance is already there. Over. - Both of you. I said: turn off the engine and get out! You heard it: we have to go. A dead woman at a vet surgery. Let's go. Well, then... Drive safely. This helps stop the inflammation. Well, I think so anyway. And this is for the pain. Morphine is not bad, is it? What's that? Nobadi. It stands for "nobody". I got that, you smart arse. That was my name in Camp Marmal. - In that NATO camp? - Yes. - That was your nickname? - Yes, master. All Afghans in the camp got nicknames. They told us it was for security reasons. But I think, in reality, they didn't want to know what our real names were. For example, if one of us was killed by the Taliban in an act of revenge, and his family came to the camp and said, "We're looking for our son, Hamid, who worked here for you, who died here for you. He's got a wife and five children." Then they would say, "Hamid? We don't know anybody by that name. We do know someone called Anton, and someone called Bert, and someone called Romeo, and someone called Mickey Mouse. But we don't know a Hamid." Get one of these tattoos next time. At least it's useful while you're alive. O. My blood type. Why are you doing this? - What? - Everything. I mean, for example, why did you come back to the bus stop? Why? When someone needs help, then you help them. Is it because you were a paramedic? - Who told you that? - You. You told the doctor. What did you do to her? What's this? An interrogation? Anyway, she was a vet. Try to get some sleep. ... had picked the right numbers for the lottery and ticked the "Joker" box. The winners are from Lower Austria and Carinthia and they each win more than 160,000 euros. I hope you've played the lottery today as well and have ticked the "Joker" box. The bleak mountain ridges bear witness to illegal logging. To cover up the traces, the area has also been set on fire. The narrow-leaved fireweed is now conquering the bleak land again. Excuse me, master. I think I'm not so well. Do you know what an amputation is? You want to cut off my leg? Otherwise, you won't survive the night. So it's a question of either-or. Or maybe even both. Have you ever done this before? I watched others do it. Often? A couple of times. And how many, for example, survived? All of them survived the amputation. Come. Dizzy. - It's the morphine. Better? Yes. Take off your trousers. Right leg. Left leg. Come on. To the table. TEXTBOOK FOR PARAMEDIC SERGEANTS AND TEAMS Wait. Watch out for the lamp. Sit up and pull up your shirt. Now you can lie down again. What now? We wait until it kicks in. "Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy. Many were the men whose cities he saw and whose mind he learned, and many the woes he suffered in his heart upon the sea, seeking to win his own life and the return of his comrades." How strange. I don't remember the face, but I can recite the beginning of the Odyssey. In the infirmary, in the camp where I used to work, there was a patient, who had been a professor of Latin and Greek. At a secondary school. In Hermannstadt or Klausenburg, I don't remember. It doesn't matter anyway. He knew the whole Odyssey by heart. In Ancient Greek and in German. Do you know what the Odyssey is? It's the story of King Odysseus. He was famous for being very clever. They called him the cunning king. He invented the Trojan horse and conquered the city of Troy. But when the war was over and everybody wanted to go back home to their families, the gods decided to have some fun and send him around the world for ten years. From one adventure to the next. He faced a witch and the Sirens, who lured the ships with their singing, only to let them hit the rocks and sink And he faced the Cyclopes. These were giants who only had a single eye in the centre of their forehead. The meanest of them, Polyphemus, captured Odysseus and his men in his cave, and each day, he would eat one of them alive. But Odysseus also managed to outwit him. And do you know what's best about this story? Guess what his nickname was. Whose nickname? Who have I been talking about all this time? Odysseus, of course. You have to listen when I tell you a story. It's your story. Odysseus' nickname was "Outis". And do you know what it means in Ancient Greek? Nobody. His nickname was "Nobody". You get it? That was his code name. What happened to him? After 20 years of wandering, he finally got back home. But the only one who recognised him was his dog. I don't mean Odysseus. I mean the professor who told you this story. What happened to him? What do you want to know? Whether I'm an anti-Semite? Whether I killed Jews? Would that be good or bad? For you as a Moslem, it's probably good. Oh, pardon me. I meant to say "Muslim", of course. - Do you feel this? - No. - And this? - No, master. That professor... What was his name? They didn't have names. Do you want to know my name, master? I know it. It's written on your arm. My real name, master. Just a second. So? What's your real name? Adib. - Adib Ghubar. - I see. - And what's your name, master? - Psst. - Your name is Psst? - Be quiet now. Tell me something, Adib Ghubar. - What do you want to hear? - Whatever. Anything. I just don't want to measure your pulse and blood pressure all the time. You can talk in Afghan if you like. I just want to hear that you're still here. - In Afghan? - Yes. - My language is Dari. - In Dari then, for all I care. - My name is Adib Ghubar. - I understand that one. I am from the northern part of Afghanistan. I was born in Jowzjan. It's about 100 kilometres from Mazar-i Sharif. - How interesting ! - I had two brothers and three sisters. When my father was my age he fought against the Russians. There you go. Four years ago he was killed by the Taliban. Our neighbour had told the Taliban that my father was an American spy. My mother fell ill. She took me out of school, so that I could support the family. So I started working in a shop. At the market. And when... the Germans came and opened the camp, I registered myself there. And when the war against terror was over, a lot of the Western soldiers went back to their countries. So no one needed me there anymore. Two friends told me that we could... Carry on! - That we should go to England. - Don't stop talking. And speak up! - Or to Germany. Or Sweden. - I can't hear you so well! They said I could find work and earn money there, without getting myself killed. And if you are frugal, you can even send some money to your family back home. And... And so we decided to leave Afghanistan and crossed the Iranian border, through Iran to Turkey. My sister was kidnapped by the Taliban, and my older brother was killed in a suicide attack. Go on. I can hardly wait to hear the rest. And my little brother burned to death in the kitchen because no one was there to rescue him. No one rescued him. And because of all this, my mother became mentally ill. Because she had lost everything that mattered to her. And so... whatever I earn here I can keep for myself. So I will be a rich and happy man soon. And if I stay alive, then I'll live happily ever after. Hello? Hello? Hey, you! You! Hey! One, two, three, four, five...
