- It's definitely him? - Yeah, man. Where's the gun? Where's my 300 quid? Glove box. - It's empty. - Bullets are in there. - There's only three. - How many do you need? How far? Not far. I bet you've confused a few people, ain't ya, coming back after 10 years? Where've you been? Hell. Tell me about it. That's it. Oh, fuck's sake. Are you fuckin' serious? Shit. - What? - Drive, don't worry! Mate, you've gotta go. The best night. When I grow up, I am definitely gonna work at the fair, 180%. Things to do, my friend. Ollie? Ollie, it's 3:00. Are you coming to bed? Oh! Oh, Ollie! Fuck! Fuckin' hell! - Ollie! Ollie... - Hello, Cheryl. Long time, no see. Where's Gemma? What are you doin' here, Bull? - Where is she? - What? I haven't seen her! I haven't seen any of them! Oh, god! Oh, god! Ollie! Tell me what happened to Aiden. I don't know! It's been years! Norm, he knows. Your family, they know. No one talks to me. I swear! Please, Bull, come on. Bull, get off! Aiden! I'm sorry. Ow! Fuck! You're not right, Bull. You're evil. There's something wrong with you. You have no idea. Bull! - Hello. - Gary, it's Jim. - Alright, mate. You okay? - No, not really, mate. It's Ollie and Cheryl, mate, they're dead. - What? - They've been killed. - How? - Butchered. Have you called Norm? No, I ain't gonna tell him, you'll have to. - Can you go around? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I can go around, yeah. Want me to drive down after? No, what are you gonna do? Look, just do me a favor, just tell Norm, alright? She was never mixed up in anything, never involved. You don't know what happened yet. Could be a robbery. Could be anything. Ta. She should never have moved away. If she was still here, we could have protected her. Protect her from what? You just said she was never mixed up in anything. She made her own choices. It was their problem. Oi, you watch what you're saying, Gary. It's my blood that was spilled. You don't have to be doing something wrong to need protectin'. In here! Is this mine? Okay, Gary. Tell me. Cheryl's dead, Norm. - You sure about this? - Yeah. And Ollie. Don't give a shit about him. Why? She's not above death. You want me to go down, see what happened? No, I want you to leave us alone. What are you gonna do about this, eh? My sister is dead! Cheryl is dead! She's fucking dead! What are you gonna do? What do we do now? What are you gonna do about it? - Adam. - Yeah? - You're Marco's boy? - Yeah. Go home and tell your dad Bull's here. Alright. Why would he be at the Youth Centre? It's been 10 years. I don't know. I'll have to have a look. You need to stay out of it, Marco. And it can't be Bull, "He's gone," you said, unless you're lyin'. I wasn't lying. I don't know what the fuck's going on. - It was him, definitely. - He doesn't know. He doesn't know what he looks like. - What are you doing? - I'm calling Norm. - To say what? - To tell him. Mate, can you turn it down? I'm on the phone. - Where are you going? - Out. - You are not. - Why? 'Cause I said so. Go upstairs, Adam! Norm? Listen, Adam says he's seen Bull. Mate, if this... What? Fuck. Yeah, mate, I'm goin' now. - What? - It's Ollie and Cheryl, - dead. - Dead? - What, murdered? - I don't know. Yes! What for? Where you going with that? Listen, just lock the doors. Bull? Fuck, I don't understand, Bull. How can you even be here? I don't get it. Neither do I, Marco. Neither do I. If you don't tell me what happened to Aiden, I'm gonna make you eat that little knife you're holding. I'm sorry, Bull. I was just doing what I was told, mate. What's goin' on? Can you come home? Marco? Marco? - Diane. - Who is it? Careful, Diane. I know you recognize my voice. - Bull? - I told you it was him. Shh! Fuckin' shut up! Where's Marco? I need you to pass on a message for me. Bull? Norm, Gary, the others. Bull, where's Marco? Bull, where's Marco? Diane, tell them I'm coming. I'm coming for all of 'em. Mum! Mum! Just stay in and lock the door, okay? And stay in your room! Oh, no! No! Oh, fuck! Oh, no! Please! Fuck! Shit! Come here right now, you fuckin' brat. No! Please, Dad, no! - You're getting a soakin'! - No! Believe me, you're givin' me - an excuse now. - Hey, Dad, no. Dad, no, no! There's water on your back of your neck. - Dad! - First time in six months. - Dad, Dad! - Bull! Oh, Bull, stop that. - Come here. - Shall we get mummy? - No, no, no, pack it in. - Dad, no! Alright, Bull! Bull! I said pack it in! Aiden, go sit with your nanny and Cheryl, yeah? - And no more water. - Aww. You're a twat, Bull, I'm soaking wet. I'm covered in it. A bit of water, what's wrong with you? What's the matter with you? Ah, just watching you piss about. Well, I'm not on show am I? You've been muckin' about with anyone? - What? Like a woman? - Have you? No. What, Gemma tell you that? She's a fucking liar. She's my daughter before your wife. Watch your fuckin' mouth, Son. You think I've got the time and energy to do anything but look after her? No, I'm not muckin' about with anyone. I'm watchin' you, Bull. Yeah, he just said that. Yeah, well, just behave yourself. I don't want her upset. She look upset to you? Oh yeah, about time. You in a rush? You ever get stuff from there? No, it's muck. - Not a pizza? - No. Yeah, mate, any garlic bread? Oh, shut up, man. It's no good, is it? You can always leave this shit for someone else to look after. Hey, remember who you're talking to. Alright, man. I've been working all day. Come on. Norm will be there waiting for you. Why aren't you coming? I'm vegetarian, mate. All I'm asking you to do is sign the contract and then it's all sorted, yeah? I can't sign it. No. I'll lose everything if I'm found out. Alan, you'll not be found out, Son. You continue to work with the farms you've already got in the books. You just accept the animals I send you, you send the meat to where I tell you. It's a no-brainer. It's not gonna fuck up anything you're already involved in, and you're not gonna be found out. Sign it, Alan. Make it legal. Anything else, you know I do things for you, Norm. But you know, they'd close me down. - You right-handed? - No. Now sign that. Left hand. Good boy. Okay, Alan, from here on in if a cop is found within a mile of this place, or your home, or wherever you are, we'll burn this place down with your staff inside it. Then we'll move on to your home and we'll burn it down with Maureen and the kids in there. - Do you understand? - Yeah, yeah. Good, man. But you are fuckin' stupid. You were always gonna sign it. Why'd you push it this far? Right. Take it easy. How comes Gary ain't here? He getting special treatment then? You have any heating? It's freezing! I told you to turn it on, I'm normally in bed. You are a wiz at gabbing. - You should have a license. - Shh! - Mm. - I'll leave with some gear. I said I would, didn't I? But don't let your dad find out. If he does, he'll kill me. No, he won't do that. You're with me now. - Hey, you go easy on that. - Mm-hmm. Go on, get that. Alright, off. What the fuck? Bull, what are you doin'? Have you been here the whole time? No, not the whole time, no. What the fuck? Are you just gonna sit there, yeah? You do that with Aiden upstairs? Yeah, he's still asleep. Yeah? He's asleep. Don't fuckin' walk away from me! Oi, Bull, where are you going? - Shut up. - Where are you going? Gonna wake him. Twat! Bull, come on, out of here. You'll fuckin' wake him, just get out of here. No, a bowl of cereal, not two bowls. Do you know how much sugar's in there? When did you tell me one bowl? Mum, come and take me to school! No, wait there, mate, don't come in here. - Why? - Mum's asleep. Am I takin' the bus today? Dad? Dad? Brush your teeth, I'll drive you. - You havin' that? - Nah, go ahead. Good, lad. Has anyone been up to the field? Why do that? To check. He's in the ground, no need to check. Yeah, too fuckin' right. No one goes up to the fuckin' field. Understood? What does Gemma know? I spoke to Gemma, she doesn't know anything. How is she? She still bad? Oi, DC Dickhead. Sorry about Cheryl. So am I. - Tea or something? - I've got time. Marco? He put a knife through his mouth. He's a fuckin' madman. - Bull? - No, it ain't Bull, it's someone else. Bull's gone. Have you found out if he's got a long-lost brother, a distant family or something? He's got no brother. His mum still lives local, so she's around. Okay, okay, we can go and pay her a visit. I don't want you doing anything... Don't fuckin' tell me, Mike, please don't tell me. Someone knows. Someone knows something. My people are dyin', so we will go and visit her. I just want you to be careful. People still ask about Aiden... Hey, Pedro, here's 40 quid on the table. Thanks, pal. And you will talk to anyone who was connected to Bull now. And you better do something. Don't let me do it myself. Marge! Margie, open the door! - The back door's open. - Yep. - Go around the back. - Yeah, you've locked it. No one mentions Bull. - Oh. - Hello, Marge. No, don't get up, honey. How are you, pet? What are you doing here? Well, we had something to do on the coast, so we just thought we'd pop in and say hello. Oh, Gary, you're not in prison? No, just good behavior. Should we put the kettle on, pet? You'll have to do it, love. There's too many of you. Colin, thanks, pal. So are you still putting your bets on? Mm, yeah. I never win anything. Yeah, me neither, darling, - never win anything. - No. You can do your bets on a computer now. I haven't got a computer. She's 83. What the hell is she gonna do with a computer? Aw, you've got some memories up here, Marge. God, Gemma looks young. She was happy. Aye, she was. So how do you get out to put your bets on? Oh, taxi Mel takes me in. No, I've just had one. I'm alright. Aye, go on. Never hear from Gemma, Norm. I'm still Aiden's gran. Whatever's gone on? Ah, you know. Things change, Margie. Look after the family as a whole, Norman. You could have done that. You loved that boy. - She won anything? - Nothin'. I can't find anything. I don't know if it's even the right date. What date did you do these, Marge? I did them yesterday, I told you. That's why I'm checking today. We haven't got nothin' in. Stop it, Norm. It's uncomfortable. I don't like being stared at. You heard about Cheryl? She's dead. Murdered. Oh, I'm sorry. Did you not hear anything about it? Oh, she's in London, isn't she? Why should I've heard anything? Marco, you know him? Only through Bull. Well, I didn't know him. He's dead too. Murdered. You been talking about Aiden to anyone? No, who would I talk to? Wait for me to come out, boys. No one around here knows anything about anything. You sure about this, Norm? Get out. Why are they leaving, Norm? You're scaring me. What are you doing? Do you know where Gemma lives? - No, no, I don't think so. - No? You never tried to find out where she is. No. Why? I don't know where she is. I haven't got a phone number. Margie, the people who are dying are all connected to Bull. And that means they're all connected to you. Come on, Norm. Let's go. Let me have my glasses, Norm. Curse the fuckin' day Gemma met your boy. Your family were put on this earth to destroy mine, and I'm not gonna allow it. Someone you know or who knows you is trying to get to me and my blood. And I'm gonna have to cut you bad until you tell me who. Mum. Mum? I'm not dead, Bull. Listen up, you, I'm not dead. I can't see you properly. I'm not dead, Bull. He hurt me. You want me to help you? What about you? What about Aiden? Close your eyes, Mum. You want another one? She'll be openin' up, 15 minutes. No one's stopping her. Oh, what, so you're gonna clear up after yourself, are you? What are we gonna do, Bull? What do you suggest? She doesn't want to be with you anymore. You've known about that for a while, have you? No. Honestly, I haven't. She can do what she wants, Norm, grown up. She wants to be with Gary. Look, Bull, I know she can be a stubborn little mare, but she wants you out the house. Fine. I can get you somewhere to stay, no problem. Look, Clive, what the fuck are you doin' here? - He's with me. - Can't he speak? Can't you speak? Don't blame me, Bull, I didn't know. Hey. Cut it out you two, grow up. Clive, get your arse somewhere else before you piss yourself. Look, Son, I just want everything to be very, very pleasant. And I'm Aiden's granddad. Whatever you're thinkin' about Gary... I don't care about Gary. That's good. If anythin' happened to him, I'd be really upset. I don't care about Gary. - Good, in that case... - I want the boy. That's not gonna happen, Bull. You know, she's on the gear, don't you? You can see him whenever. Nope, I want him. She can do what she wants. She can have the money, the house, she can let Gary fuck her. - Let everyone have a go... - Careful. Is there something you wanna add, Sharon? She can have it all. But she ain't havin' Aiden. You can tell her that from me. - Done your bottom? - Yeah. Yeah, with soap, not just your hands? No one likes a pooey bum. - No girl's comin' with a... - Oh! It went into my eyes! - Well, rinse it. - Oh. Rinse it off. Look at the shower. - Dad, can you get me, ow! - Here, come here, you. Come here, wuss. Look at that earhole. How much wax there is in there? You can get a candle outta that. - Is that hot? - No, it's fine. Do the front. Dad, you're getting it in my eyes! Alright. Finish your chapter before we put the telly on, yeah? - What? I've done it! - Yeah, bollocks. Yeah? Do you wanna go to the fair? Aiden's dressed for bed, I can't. Bring him. There'll be other nights, boys. I can't do it. Norm wants to see you. Is he asking or telling? Alright, I'll see you in a bit. He said we should take you. No chance. If he wants me to come, I'll come, but I'm driving meself. Tell him I'll be an hour. We going to bed? - Yeah? - Yeah, I got a drop. Yeah. No, oh! - Hey, you got at least one! - I think so. Nothing. See, you made a noise and nothing's come out. Oh yeah? I'm coming for you. I'm coming for you. - Oh, you got me. - Five points. You kidding me. You gotta do the punch bag. - Oh, come on. - I told you, it's fixed, pal. Oh, come on, it isn't. I can do it. Come on. It'll give you the same number however hard you hit it. Alright, excuse me, boys. Little Mike Tyson wants to have go. Alright, I'm paying for two goes. Ah, see? You punch like a baby. See, I told you, broken. You're well hard, Dad. You're so mean, you make grown men cry. I think you loosened it for me. Bull! - Hey. - How are you, mate? Yeah. Not been on the dodgems? No, we'll get to the dodgems. - What's going on? - Nothing. Just wanna talk some business with you. - Alright, my boy? - Hey, granddad. Guys, why don't you take the kid for a ride? What do you fancy, Aiden? - The dodgems. - Yeah. No, I'll take you on the dodgems. Take him on something else. Come on. Don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to him. Let's go for a little ride on the wheel, hey? Thanks, Richie. Okay, we're just gonna sit here for a wee while and look at the view. You know, she can fuck everything up, Norm. It's not about Gary. I know, but she is my lassie. - Hi, Mum. - Hello. You fucking cunt, Norm. I did ask you, Bull. In you go. You fucking cunt! Don't tempt me. I don't care who sees, I'll split you wide open. Now take it down. Take it down! Take it down. Take it down! Take it down! You cunts are dead. - He'll be alright. - Fuckin' dead. Yeah, they just do what they're told. I've known Marco his whole life. Yeah, but you ain't payin' him. - Where's the boy? - With his mum. You should have just left there. Do you reckon she thinks anything of you, you thick twat? In the boot, Bull. She's probably fucked every man you know. You wash your fuckin' mouth out, Son, and never mention her name again. Get him in the boot! Tie his hands! Sorry, Bull. I would like a dog as well. That would be fun. Hello, Clive. You knew I was coming. Why so shocked? - Who are you? - I'm the big bad wolf. You must be the little piggies, which makes you daddy pig. Cat got your tongue? No. Get in the car. - The kids are with me. - We can all go together. Would you like to come with me and daddy pig to the funfair? He told me he was gonna buy eight bags of candy floss for your dinner. Sugar! I can't, Bull. If you don't come, I will huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house down. Mummy pig won't like that, will she? What are you gonna do? We're gonna go on the rides, Clive. Jump in. It'll be alright. What are you crying for? Their mum's gonna be worryin' about them. Why? They're with their dad, innit they? We're all going to the funfair. How are you two little piggies getting on? Bull? Bull, you won't do anything to me kids? Please, Bull, please? I haven't decided yet. Where is she? - Gemma? - No, Alanis Morissette! Gemma! I've not seen her in about like... Not since she left Gary. - What about Aiden? - I don't know. Norm doesn't say anything about him or Gemma to us. - Well, not to me, anyway. - To Gary? Look, you'll have to ask Gary. I'm asking you. She was in a pretty bad way when she left, far gone with the heroin. Phone Gary. Get him to the funfair. Like how? I don't care how you do it, daddy pig, just fucking do it. That was fun, wasn't it? He's here. - Where? - Waltzers. Does he know I'm here? No. I swear. God's me witness. I swear, Bull. Well, then you can have your candy floss back, daddy pig. Goodnight, kids. - Sick fuck. - Gary, Gary, Gary. It's true. I'll cut you from bullock to arse. Where's Clive? Safe and sound now you're here. Come on, let's ride. How? - How? - Not how, why. Hey, mate, how much is it? 8 quid for both. Here, this is for you and your boys. Spin it like you're tryin' to kill us. - Are you serious? - Yeah, fast, don't stop. You understand? You're the fucking boss, mate. You're gonna love this! Where is she? Who? Don't fuck about, Gary. It's gone past that. I haven't seen her, Bull. - I haven't seen her. - You know where she is? She left me not long after you... After I what? I've been inside and I haven't seen her. Do you know where she is? Keep spinning, boys! Faster! Faster! Where Gary? Where is she? Norm won't tell anyone. - Jesus, Bull! - Keep spinning! Norm's often going to Chardfon. She must be there! I'm not cheatin'! I'm sorry, Bull. Really, I'm sorry. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! What the fuck? What are you doing? Wait! What the fuck? Can you get off him, you little prick! - Tell her to get out! - Get off him! Get out, Sally! Take her out! Stop fighting. You're gonna hurt yourself. Who the fuck are you? I don't fuckin' know you. - What have you got? - What? What have you got? What are you selling? Well, I've just got pills and coke. You can have it, you can take it. I don't want it. - Who's got heroin?? - Well, I don't. I haven't got any, I haven't got any! - I swear, I swear! - Who? Who? Someone in this shitty town, who? Okay, alright, alright. I know a couple of people. You broke my fuckin' fingers, man. Fuck's sake. - What am I sayin'? - Tell him I wanna see him. He's not gonna come here if he doesn't know you. He will if I'm buying. Dave, yeah, I've got somebody who wants to meet. Yeah, but he doesn't want what I got, he wants what you got. Alright, can we come over? Has he got money? You got money? Yeah, of course, he's got fucking money! Why else am I calling you? Yes, okay, right. Yeah, okay, okay. Comin' over, right. Would you need me to go? Yeah, Dave, it's me. Can we come up? Yeah, go through, sit down. Yeah, shut the door, locks itself. Do I know you? No, you don't. What happened to your hand? - Nothing, trapped it. - Bollocks. You've been dickin' people, haven't you? Selling your shitty gear. - You keep fit. Cardio? - No. You can be fat as a fuckin' ass. As long as you've got cardio, it don't matter. Eh, I hate runnin', that's why I do football. Here you are, have them. Shin pads, socks, I've got loads. Top tip, always play with kids. The kids don't run, but I do. That's why I show 'em up. That's why I drink this shit. That's why I get 10 fucking goals a game, mate. Let's see your money then. I'll swap you, a swig of that drink. Fuck! Stay where you are. Stay! Oh, God! What the fuck? Who are you? What have I done? You've done enough, Dave. Come on, let's fix it. Bite down on that. What? What are you doing? You don't want to bleed to death. Bite down on it. You been in this flat before? Yeah. You know where he keeps his money and stuff? Yeah. Go and get it. He won't need it. Oi, wake up now. You get it? What is it? Money and gear? Money, pills, and a few rings and that. Leave the money, take everything else. If you see him again, tell him I done it. Hey. Hey. Dammit. What did I do to you? Gemma Harris. What? What about her? Where is she? At home, probably. - You know where that is? - Yeah. Of course I do. What number? I only know the house. Tell me which one. The last one, in the corner. You wanna stay in here? I'll just lay here. I think I'm bleeding on the seat. Stand up. I'm fuckin' struggling. - Gary, get out. - Why do I have to go? 'Cause it's your fuckin' fault we're here in the first place. Get out. Bull, you want some of this? - How long am I staying? - I've honestly no idea. Depends how long she takes to get here, but you've certainly pissed her off. No change there then. You guys want some of this? So, where did it all go wrong, Son? When I married your daughter. Probably. Anything happens to him... Nothing's gonna happen to him. He's my grandson. Why don't you drink your whiskey, Bull? It'll help. Is that her? I can't see, there's headlights. Now, go and to take a look, will you? You cunt, Bull! Slimy little arsehole! I should never have married you! Gemma, get off! What are you doing? Get off! Get off! - Get in the bedroom! - Why? 'Cause I said so and you're fuckin' drunk! - Oh, bollock! - Marco, get her in there! And you think she's gonna look after Aiden, do you? I'll look after him better than you! She gets what she wants, Bull, you know that. Call your dad get him down here. Tell him I'm outside. What? Why? Tell him I'm asleep in the back of the car parked directly outside your house. What do you want from him? Dial the number, tell him you're scared. I am scared. Please, I am scared, Bull. I will cut your throat if you fuck it up. Dad? Dad, Bull's outside. He's outside in the car. No, no, no, he's asleep. How long? - How long will he be? - 25 minutes. What are you gonna do, Bull? Wait, no, no, no, no... I gotta ask you this, Bull. What are you gonna do if ever you got out of this? Honestly? Yeah, you're an honest guy. If I get out of this, I'll fucking kill every one of you. Yeah, I thought so. Gemma, sure? Yeah. Go get the petrol. Look at this drink, Bull! Yeah. Come on, drink it up, you won't feel a thing. Yeah. There. Everybody out! Wrap the gun in your coat. What? And shoot through the window? Unless the door's open. Done. Okay, take the body somewhere else, dump it in the sea or something. Yeah. Gem? Gemma? Gemma? Guess who, Norman? Looks like you're shot her. If you'd had done that years ago, none of this would have happened. How, Bull? How the hell... It's a long story. How long you got? Bite down on your hand, I'll sum it. I'm gonna do it, so bite that. I know it hurts, you bastard. It serves you fuckin' right. You got hell to look forward to you, yeah? You can work that out without. You prick! Come on. I wanna see it burn. - Oh shit! - Mum? - Aiden! - What's going on? What the hell is he doing here? Where else am I gonna leave him? - Mum, what's goin' on? - Marco, get him back in the car now! - Get in the car, Aiden. - It's burning up. Get back in the car, Aiden. - Aiden! - Mum, what is going on? Are you out of your fucking mind? - Mum! - Get back in the car. Aiden! Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Get in the car, Aiden.

You can hear him screaming. - Where is he? Where is he? - No! Look at me! Where is he? Look in my eyes! Look at 'em! Where is he? Where is he? No, Bull, no. - No! - Where is he? - No, no, no, no, no, no! - Where is he? He's down at the broken bridge, the broken bridge in town. Dad! Get off him, please. Get off him, Bull, please. You were supposed to look after him. What the fuck did you do to him, Gemma? - Why, Gemma? - He deserved better! He said he didn't want helping. How could you do that to our boy? I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You got him on the gear! Please, get off him, please! Oh, no! Get off him! You've killed him! Please! Please! No, please. Please, no. Look at me. Hey, look at me! Come here. Come here. Aiden, come on, Son. Come on. Come on. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Come on. - Where am I? - You're with me, Son. Now, we wait. How long? How long's a piece of string? A meter? Are you happy, Dad? Yeah. Sittin' here, fishing with you, it's a lovely day, the birds are singing. I love you. Hello? Hello? Hello? He's alive. No. How dare you enter here. How dare you enter here! This is a house of God! Please. What do you want? Salvation. Impossible. No. Never! Never! For him. My son. Give him a chance. Help him spend this getting clean. Please, please, please, please, please. Thank you. You're not right, Bull. You're evil. There's something's wrong with you. You have no idea. Aiden! - Where'd you go? - Hell. Aiden! Phone Gary, get him to the funfair. I don't care how you do it, daddy pig, just fucking do it. Look at my eyes! Look at 'em! Look at me! How, Bull? - How the hell... - It's a long story. How long you got?
