[crickets and birds chirping] [birds chirping] [bullet whooshes] [heavy shelling & helicopter whirring] [upbeat score kicks in] [gasps for breath] [silently wails in pain] What the hell? What are you doing, Varun? Instead of treating him first... you've been treating a terrorist. I was just trying to give him a treatment. He has been severely injured and got a Flail Chest. He can't be saved! In his case, only the hand is injured. Simple amputation can save his life. Do you know who is he? Retd. Col. Sandeep Gowda's son! So, what? Why are you getting emotional about it? Think practically. Despite making an effort, he'll die... rather we can save him and gather information in future. Just think practically. Proceed! [helicopter whirrs and fades] [Voice Mail] Varun, I've taken this decision, after thinking through it. We're not a good match. Let's call off this wedding. Bye! [IVR Message] SIX MONTHS AGO "Her beautiful face, distracted me to bits" "When her shadow grazed, I turned into a living statute" "Oh, her beautiful face, distracted me to bits" "When her shadow grazed, I turned into a living statute" Do you always wear your top button? Isn't that the purpose of it? Oh! -Did you get a gift? -I know it's a gift! What gift? A book on"How to be perfect in life." You look extremely disciplined. What time do you usually wake up in the morning? 04:30 AM Is it 'cause you deliver milk in the morning? No, I wake up to study. Study! -You're really beautiful. -Thank you. "No girl I met has until now..." "killed me with her beauty and resurrected me" "No girl I met has until now..." "killed me with her beauty and resurrected me" "Little time I get to walk with you, is a blessing itself" "I look for you all night relentlessly" "despite having found you I lose myself just as wind ceases the lamp" Can I take a picture? Sure, go ahead. But, please, delete it right after. PRESENT DAY [street vendors calling out] Hey, don't forget to take your lunch box. Please don't run your mouth out there, we'll do the talking. I'll try my best not to. -I can't help it, if they go overboard. -Bye, mom! She'll definitely going to reject you. Stay strong! Keep moving. [bluesy music plays] Don't know how to put it across... It's kind of hard for us to say this. Calling off the wedding... is not an easy task, but... it's a relief that they found out they're not compatible with each other. If this was the case post marriage, then... it would've been tough. Don't generalize it. Can you please specify why they are not compatible? I can't get into specific details-- Sister-in-law, let me explain it explain it clearly. Let them get a clarity too. Auntie, I have a few expectations from my to-be-husband. Can you please specify? As in, he should be positive, emotional and caring. I expected someone who gives importance to emotions. But, auntie, your son and emotions are poles apart. You're too young to be contemplating ones' character. It's based on little things I noticed. The other day, I texted him saying, I'm very tired and my legs are hurting from shopping since morning. Do you know what was his reply to that text? What was your reply? OMEGA-350. One tablet in the morning and one for the night. You heard it. But I expected a different reply from him. "Oh, no, you're legs are hurting is it?" "If I were there, I would've made you a hot cup of tea." 'I would've massaged your legs." I want a husband who cares, auntie. A doctor who prescribes medicine... I don't want! Having a doctor in the family is a good thing, dear. I can find a doctor by fixing an appointment, uncle. I don't really have to get married to one. Just 'cause in future, if I encounter a problem with the water supply... I can't marry a plumber. -Correct. -Uncle, you can stay silent like usual. I'll talk to auntie about it. Mini! I think you've mistaken about him. You don't preach me about it. Dad, doesn't like sister-in-law at all. He asked you not to marry her... if you do, you'll remain a slave to her. I'm not trying to pit you two against each other. Just saying! But you still went ahead and got married to her. You did as per your will. Similarly, calling off this wedding is my wish. But I like you very much, sister-in-law. I liked you the first time I met you. When your father was admitted at the hospital... I sent him the report and asked for his opinion. Do you know what he replied? Ask him yourself. What was your reply? I told her, he'll die in next 12 hours. Just as he mentioned, he died in next 12 hours. He told you the right thing, dear. He died exactly as he mentioned. Him passing was not an issue at all. It's not right to mention something so negative. "Nothing to worry, be happy... everything will be fine." He should be positive about it. How can you state a negative report as positive? You have to. You have to be positive about it. Positivity is everything. You have to whisper to the dead... saying,"you're fine and nothing to worry" even the dead might come alive. I've told you a million times, that pretty girls are dumb. See for yourself. Two doctors getting married will make a perfect match. Listen, I don't like to beat around the bush. Let me be frank with you. I don't like you! Same to you. I'm happy that you called off the wedding. Come on, let's go. -What about him? Let him come later, when he feels like it. Let us go. My son! They have left. Over? I'm running late. My, dad! [clears throat] Son... a cup of tea? [glass clinks] Do you believe in God? I do, sir. That God has saved you from this disastrous wedding. If you allow her in your life, she'll ruin it. You saw how she pitted me against my daughter-in-law. [clears throat] We'll be eventually in trouble. For our daughter's well-being, we found a humble boy as a match. But she insulted and humiliated you in front of everyone. Obviously, your parents will be pissed. There's nothing wrong with you. You're well-educated, good looking, and a good man. You'll definitely find a perfect match. But she deserves a good beating. A person who can keep her under control and break her arrogance. Uncle, I'm arrogant too. [bluesy music plays] [glass clatters] [phone rings] [ringing stops] -Tell me, Preethi. -Did Chinnu come home? Hey, why are you asking me? Didn't you go there to pick up her? They said, the school ended in the afternoon. -But I can't find, Chinnu. -What? -I'm really scared! -I don't get it. Are you kidding? -Hey, did you ask the security guard? -Ma'am, I checked with everyone. -What happened? -You stay right there, I'm coming. -I'm coming over to the school. -Okay, ma'am. -What happened? -Chinnu's school ended half-day, today. It seems she can't find her. Get me my wallet. -Get over here. -She must be at her friends' place. -You get over here. -Call Priya's mother. -Please book a cab. -I'll get my phone. [tense music plays] -Check if she booked a cab. -She's booking. I'm calling, Priya. Hello, Priya, this is Priyanka's mother speaking. -Did she come to your house. -In 3 minutes cab will be here. -Did you check with the driver? -Can you share Samyuktha's number? Thank you, dear. -Dad, you stay at home. -Okay, I'll stay back. -This way? -Yes, it's coming this way. -What happened? -Chinnu's school ended half-day. Neither she's at school nor she came home. I'm worried. -Did you inquire at the school? -We're headed out there. We've booked a cab. Cab? Can I drop you guys in my car? -You call your uncle. I'll call Sukanya. -Mom, what did Preethi, say? -Is she at the school-- -Please wear your seat belt. Is this Sukanya's mother? This is Priyanka's mother speaking. Did she come to your house? -Please wear your seat belt. -Oh, is it. -Pass on the phone to Sukanya. -Uncle, this is Navneet speaking. -Sukanya, when did Priyanka leave? -Chinnu's school ended half-day... wanted to check if she came over? Is that so? -Ask her to call me, if she gets there. -Okay, uncle. Thank you, dear. -She's not at uncle's house. -She never went to Sukanya's house. Making a scene about the situation... or yelling at people accusing them is not going to be useful. We gave half-day off, 'cause our school correspondent passed away. File a complaint at the police station and start looking for your daughter. We'll support you in this matter in every way we could. Let's hope for the best. [police radio chatter] Sir, I've filed an FIR. We've already started to look for your daughter. Don't get too scared. If you get into depression, it'll become tough to find your daughter. You have to be strong and face the situation. [phone rings] Tell me. Okay. Muthu, tomorrow at 05:00 PM remember to pick up my daughter from the coaching class. [phone receiver clicks] In case, if someone has kidnapped her... they'll call you either to threaten or demand ransom. By chance if they call, in order to track and monitor it... we'll have one of our men stationed at your house. -Where is Bhagat? -He's on his way. [bike revs and honks] [ominous score plays] [Bhagat] They summon me as they please. And they expect me to appear at once. -Sir... Sir... -As if I'm sitting ducks. -What is it? -Do you remember me? Your name is Daniel D'Souza. You work as an Engine Driver at Metro Railways. Your daughter's name is, Angelina D'Souza. Last month on the 8th at 8 PM, your daughter went missing on her way to the school. Age: 12. Height: 5'2". Weight: 41 kgs. Brown color eyes. Enough details? Or should I mention the names of your ancestors too? Bloody, are you checking my memory power? -I didn't mean to-- -I know what you're getting at. Will we find your daughter or not? -Yes, sir. -Shall I lie or tell you the truth? Please tell me the truth, sir. If I tell you the truth, you'll get emotional. So. I'll lie to you. We'll definitely find your daughter. [sniffles and cries] Sir... what happened? It's been a month and half, since my daughter went missing. No idea, where she is and what happened to her. What are they saying? They said will let me know if they find her. When will they find her? I've been asking the same question daily. But they don't seem to answer it. Please ask them to say something. At least ask them say that my daughter died. Did anyone unknown visited your house lately? [revolving door opens and closes] Good morning, sir! Why are you screaming? -Did you eat? [squeals reply] [clears throat] You do one thing. Their daughter has gone missing. You go along with them... and tap the phone if they receive a threatening call. Monitor it closely. Oh, no, this has become a routine now. You promised to recommend me to the department. But you've been assigning me the same job. How long do you expect me to record the call? When will I get to join the department and break the record? You're talking too much. You don't have to do it. -I'll send someone else. -Oh, no, I'll go! Come on, leave. There's nothing more important than taking care of your daughter. That's enough. Hey, stay put inside the house. Don't go out. Shall I stay put even if I had to go to restroom? [sniffles and cries] All perfect. Final checking. I'm hungry. I'll return once I'm done with my meal. Sir, you're being irresponsible. [radio static] In the meantime, if we get a call? In the meantime, I got hungry! You just had your coffee. Oh, you're keeping an account, is it? This is your first case. To me this is 17th case. If an eight-year-old goes missing... she'll never come back. Maximum, it's a case of human trafficking. Sir, what is human trafficking? Kidnapping people to sell them elsewhere. Don't annoy me by saying someone might call asking for ransom. You have a triple bedroom. Each pick one and cry inside the room No one understood a thing I said. Only, he seemed to have understood it. He accepted the truth and is getting ready another child. But why is he going inside the room alone and locking it up? Oh, no, you instigated him to commit suicide. Hey, shut up, damn it! Please someone hurry up and save him. What happened? Please hear me out. Hey, go and break down the door. I can't break down the door, I'll get hurt instead. Step aside. Save him before I return from my meal. Hope nothing bad happens. [bang opens the door] [fan creaking] [bursts into tears] If you're courageous enough to commit suicide. Why don't you use the same courage to find your daughter? Let police do their job. Let's look for her ourselves too. Listen, police will never look for her. They'll never help ordinary people like us. If it was a politician or higher official's children went missing... they'll even bring down the military to look for them. The second option you mentioned is the right thing to do. Only you have to look for your daughter. Listen to him and look for her until you can. If you can't, then please die. Then, I'll see who comes to save you. Until then no one's supposed to remove that saree. Stop staring. Your niece is missing and you're staring at me. Will you like it, if I do the same to you? Irresponsible lady! As far as I know, you think from others perspective. But in this case, you're not thinking from your daughter's perspective. What would she think? I have a father... she'll be hoping that you'll manage to somehow save her. If you die, then you're Giring your daughter's hope too. [song begins] "O' heart... O' my dear heart..." "It's bound to thaw and shatter. Come closer!" "O' dear heart..." "it's bound to thaw!" "O' heart... O' my dear heart..." "It's bound to thaw and shatter. Come closer!" "O' dear heart..." "it's bound to thaw!" "Nightmares have been keeping up, thinking about you." "This pain has shattered me into pieces" "I suffered in your memory" "I thrummed in your separation" "O' dear... This is an unbearable pain" "I suffered in your memory" "I thrummed in your separation" "O' dear... This pain is unbearable" To-date in four years, 400 girls have went missing. It's a very big deal, even if 10 had returned. I'm being honest, 'cause you're my friend. You won't find your daughter. I've asked my men to look for your daughter. I can't seem to find her. Looks like this game is out of my league. You keep looking for her. That's the right thing to do. "Don't leave me and go far away" "My eyes can't bear the burden of tears" "I'll be the shadow that lives with you" "A shadow doesn't know how to speak" "I'm going to live a life in solitude" "Gut wrenching pain with loads of memories" "why am I withering?" "Nightmares have been keeping up, thinking about you." "This pain has shattered me into pieces" "I suffered in your memory" "I thrummed in your separation" "O' dear... This pain is unbearable" "I suffered in your memory" "I thrummed in your separation" "O' dear... This pain--" [song ends abruptly] Navneet, I feel your pain, brother. I've informed all the officials about it. They'll find your daughter for sure. But MLA is expecting some money. So, as a compensation, pay him six lakhs. Subramani, he's my friend. Make sure everything goes well. "O' heart... O' my dear heart..." "It's bound to thaw and shatter. Come closer!" "O' dear heart..." "it's bound to thaw!" "O' heart... O' my dear heart..." That was not Chinnu. "O' dear heart..." "it's bound to thaw!" [crickets chirping] [birds chirping] Colonel, I had mentioned to you about a missing girl, right? This is her father and mo-- This is my last weeks' medical check-up report. Give me your opinion. [bass music plays] Creatinine and neuric acid levels are high. You should definitely reduce the intake of alcohol. What if I don't? You'll die soon. Okay. Now, tell me. The girl which went missing... this is her father, mother and Padmini. Hello, sir. -Fiance? -Ex-Fiance, Colonel. Fine, I'll speak to the commissioner and ask him to put extra pressure. If he adds pressure, they'll add two more police. That's it. There's no guarantee that we'll find the girl. So, you already have a plan in place. What are you going to do? Kidnapping! [tap opens water running] He wants to do kidnapping. That too commissioner's daughter. Instead of finding a way to find, Chinnu... he's planning to get everyone in trouble. He's going to kidnap commissioner's daughter, 'cause our child went missing. Damn you, man, pegs himself to be a genius. You know how bizarre it sounds... like someone's been prescribed to change undies for knee pain. Absolutely ridiculous! I wonder how someone can suggest such an idea. He has not sense at all! I meant us. That's why, you came as a blessing from, God. I'm getting late for the meeting. I'll take a leave. If we find Chinnu during the process of looking for her... I have no intention to use this to my advantage in getting married to you. I thought of mentioning it to you. -So, said it. -Okay. [mellow score plays] We all are aware, what we're about to do. We may think about a million things before a surgery. But, once the blade touches the body... without second thoughts about the success or the failure we should keep doing our job like a robot. In situations like this our worst enemy is, emotions! We should separate ourselves from emotions. Okay? [ice cream truck bells in the background] How can we do something without emotions? A feel, love, care, all that matters. In Chinnu's rescue mission... I'm the commander and you people are soldiers. So, you'll only listen and follow orders from me. Discipline is important in military. And I don't like you talking to me like this. -Get up and get out. -What? Are you going to leave? Or shall I? Dear! [tense music intensifies] I hope you guys are okay with it. We've decided to bet our lives on it. It doesn't matter if we get hanged to death or die in an accident. It's all the same. He kicked me out too. [tense music ends] If you do as I say, I'll pay you 1000 rupees. If you come and beg along with me, I'll pay you 3000 rupees. Oh, God. I'll pay you 5000 rupees. Do you really think, I'll sweat to make 5000 rupees? How much do you want? Can you pay me 10,000 rupees? You never mentioned who you are. If I mention it, the rate is 10,000 rupees. If I don't mention it, then I'll pay you 20,000. I don't care about your identity. Do you know to play cricket? Do you know to bowl? [ball whooshes and thuds on helmet] [tapping cricket ball] Hey, little boy. How are you? If I strike, I'll score boundary Baasha! -Kid, please move aside. -Did you watch, CSK match? -Camera 1 view is clear. -It was an awesome match. -Camera 2 and 3, be ready. -Thala Dhoni, rocked the match. Dhoni is in place. But no one has recognized him yet. Be alert! Dhoni? Don't mention it to anyone. Okay! Let's go. Hey, Dhoni is here! [overlapping chatter] [ominous music plays] Navneet, don't panic. Keep calm and do it casually. Take out the handkerchief from your pocket... and hold it close to girl's mouth and nose for 10 seconds. Be cool and don't be scared. [cheerful children chatter] [score intensifies] Dhoni, Dhoni, please give me an autograph. Dhoni. Autograph, Dhoni! Dhoni, Dhoni, autograph! [ominous music continues] [children clamoring] Old man, return my bat. Old man, return my bat. Stop right there! Old man, return my bat. Oh, no, old man! [car door slides open] Come on, start the vehicle. We didn't come here to take this bat. -Wear your mask. -Sorry. Give me that. Please return my bat. Where's my bat? [train horn blaring] [squeals funnily] [door bell rings] [door opens] Where were you guys all this while? -We went for cinema. -Cinema? Yesterday you were about to suicide. And today you went for cinema. Tomorrow, are you planning to go on a picnic with family. Idiot! What's inside that sack? We bought popcorn. Popcorn? It looks like a bag full of crap. Why would you need such a big sack for popcorn? Untie the sack. Are you going to untie the sack? Or shall I call the police? Damn it, how did he find out? -Hey, stop staring at me like a cartoon. -Who tied the sack? -It was me. -Do as I say. If you dare to scare a police man, you'll be destroyed. You get the sack inside the house. I'll speak to him. What are you going to say? Why the hell are you pushing me? Seems like you'll beat me up. How dare you lay your hands on a cop? Get inside. Come on, hurry up. We kidnapped, Asst. Commissioner’s daughter. Why the hell did you kidnap her? Didn't you say that, police won't bother looking for ordinary people. But if it's one of their own, they'll hunt down the kidnapper. Correct. If AC's daughter is missing, they'll only look for her. How does that help in finding your Chinnu? But we can find out the process how they hunt down the kidnapper. How? You hold a police walkie-talkie. Oh, so that's your plan. What if the police gets to you first... you people will get caught. Then, what will you do? Don't worry, I swear I won't rat you out. I swear, you should mention my name. Everyone should know that I was the mastermind behind this kidnapping. Only then they'll be careful with, Bhagat. By the time the case comes to an end... I should either chase the criminal as a police or chase the police as a criminal. Hey, I'm speaking to you. But you don't seem to pay heed to me. We'll make them run, sir. [cheerful music plays] [Radio] Sir, we caught them. -We're checking the vehicles now. -We've arrested everyone in this area. -Right here at J7 police station. -Accused name is, Ramanujam? -That's right, sir. -Okay, sir. We're on the lookout. Hey, check that vehicle. Sir, we nabbed four accused until now. [low sniffles and cry] You're, Dhoni, is it? You won't reply is it? [screams in pain] How dare you indulge in kidnapping? I'll skin you alive. You were decently begging all this while. You should've continued it. Why did you indulge in kidnapping? -Hey, get something to eat for him. -Okay, sir. Do you want to eat? Dhoni, do you like to eat? What are you saying? [men cheering] Hey, hit it right. I bet 500 rupees on you. Don't you worry, I'm right here. Come on, do it! You managed to strike again. Now it's my turn. Philip, don't be scared. Don't let this getaway. I'll lose 500 rupees. Come on, strike it hard! Don't spare him. He's totally hopeless! Bloody buffalo, don't you understand what I'm saying? You look like an owl hanging on the noose. Hey, you don't give a thought, before placing a bet? Similarly, don't you think before kidnapping a girl? Do you have a warrant? -[slaps hard] Start the jeep. Come on, step out of the vehicle. Get lost! Annoying faces. -Buddy! -Tell me, brother. Business is dull these days. -Karma is boomerang! -Vijay? It's not Vijay. It's Karma! Earlier when we used to kidnap, someone else used to take the heat. But, now, someone has kidnapped, but we're facing the heat. The police has kidnapped me more than I've kidnapped people. -What is the case? -AC's daughter has been kidnapped. They kidnapped AC's daughter! As if there's scarcity for girls in the town. Who's the fool that kidnapped AC's daughter? [door creaks open loudly] Oh, no! [slaps hard] [yelps in pain] Moron, stepped on my leg, damn it. Sir, we arrested all the kidnappers in the city. I'm sure one among them is the kidnapper. The person who messed with the police family... his hands should be hacked. [crickets chirping loudly] Eat. Please, eat, dear. [radio static] [door creaks open and closes] That girl has been crying continuously. I feel sorry for her. You feel sorry for her? Then drop that girl at her house. I'll leave. I didn't mean that. Just saying, that I felt sorry. I've been working day/night 'cause your child went missing. Don't you feel sorry for me? She hasn't eaten anything since morning. She'll eventually eat, when she's hungry. -Do you feel sorry too? -No. I'm having fun though. We're not on a vacation to have fun. Go! So, you yell at everything I say. I'm leaving. Enough with the smiles. Wear your masks, damn it. [men scream in chronic pain] Sir, we're not the kidnappers. Oh, god, sir, it's hurting like hell. One minute. They found the girl. -[screaming ends] Isn't that obvious! I was saying the same since the beginning. A professional kidnapper will never do such a thing. You never listened to me. [suspenseful music plays] Hey, stop right there! Preethi, pretend that you've fainted. Hey, step outside the vehicle. Until I say so, no one should step outside the vehicle. Stop staring at me. Set outside. Sir, Preethi has fainted. We have to take her to the hospital. Can't you hear me, damn it? Enough with the nonsense. Step outside. Step outside, damn it. -[sickle clangs] Come on, hurry up. I think they have an emergency. We'll find another vehicle. Everyone please step outside. Hey, specs! Get down, damn it. Hey, white woman, you too. Hey, I'm going to kill you. Hey, Giri, come on, hurry up! Why are you begging to them? She has fainted. We have to take her to the hospital. She fainted, is it? Hey, drag her outside the vehicle. Hey, you don't get it. Do you? Hey, stop touching her and just pick her up. -Hold her properly. -Sir, she has fainted. Enough with this nonsense. Pull her out of the vehicle. You're carrying truck inside a share-auto. -Hey, pull her out. -Sir, I don't want any trouble. Bloody, how dare you lay your hands on me? [loud sickle clang] Hey, enough with sassing him. Put him inside the auto. You guys are pissing me off. I asked you to gag him. But you've given your finger to bite. You're being unprofessional. If you continue to be, then you'll be a hapless rogue. Hey, Giri, what the hell is this? - [loud thump] Bloody! -Damn it. You never noticed and held him at knife-point. What if he had shot you with it? Sir, I think you're in a hurry. Please leave. Hey, put madam back in the auto. Brother, no need for it. I can walk myself. Sir, all part of the plan, is it? You're scheming a huge plan! [groans in pain] He's screaming a lot. We'll take the corner seat. Can you please drop us on your way? -You don't want him to scream, right? -Yes. - [hard punch] - Step aside. [shudders in pain] [body thuds] Hey, you just put him down so easy. I have to present him in an hour. One hour is difficult. But in two hours he'll wake up himself. But if he doesn't, then call me at 9445471051. I'll tell you what to do. -Hey, Giri, did you note it down? -You didn't? Bloody, note it down! Hey! What? -Do you know to read? -I do. Do you have medicine for hair-loss? Say, yes if you do, if not say no. Why are you making faces, damn it? I'm making faces, is it? [engine starts and drives away] -They grilled us royally. -Hope you're well. Shall I show my rear? Kamalakannan. Kamesh. Pratap! You three come over here and wait. [groans in pain] -Why did you call us? -Tell me, brother. AC wish to apologize to you guys. He doesn't have to apologize. Tell him that I forgave him. Hey! If AC is apologizing, you gotta take it. If you don't take it. Then, they'll bring you back for more beating. Do you really wanna risk it? Come inside. [rickshaw zooms past] Do you have a license for that gun? License? If you don't hold a license, isn't it illegal? Do you think it's legal to kidnap commissioner's daughter? Until we find Chinnu, everything we do is illegal. How much did you score in 10th grade? Understood. I shouldn't ask any questions. Am I right? [comical score begins] Why are they still here? Sir, if you apologize, we'll leave from here. Sir, look how arrogant they are. Their demand is that you have to apologize to them along with your family. They won't leave the station, until you do so. Especially, this guy is very stubborn asking for you. You want me to apologize? Did you see how he pushed that cupboard on to me? Sir, please hop on, I'll take you to the hospital. Hey, we never asked for you help. -You three look dead-beat. -Pratap. Kamalakannan. Kamesh. Why the hell is he calling us out again? Come over here, IG wish to apologize to you guys. [gasps in shock] Hey, get inside the vehicle. Brother, please move aside. Take the vehicle soon. [door squeals open] [comical score intensifies] [surgical cart rolls away] [blaring horns] Sir, please have some tender coconut. [comical score ends] Who are you? I'm Navaneet. Navaneet? Are you the Prime Minister? I'm the girl's father. Please drink. [whimpers in pain] This girl's name is, Priyanka. at 12 noon, when she was leaving from the school this girl was kidnapped by someone. Oh, no, who the hell was it? When we tracked down the cell phones of the kidnappers in the city... your cell phone signals were close to the tower near the school. So, one among you three has kidnapped this girl. [gapes in shock] If you confess to the crime... I'll put back the kidney, that I removed from your bodies. I don't get it. [jar clangs] I'll return your kidneys, and stitch it back into your bodies. Did you just say, you took our kidneys? What did he remove? -He removed our kidneys. -That's it, right. He didn't take our mobile or wallets, right? Bloody, buffalo, don't you know what a kidney is? We have two kidneys. He took one... can't we adjust with the other we have? Hey, we're chronic drunkards... even four kidney won't be enough. What will you do with just one kidney? Hey, stop kidding with us. Bloody! [groans in pain] Don't get panicked. Your stitches will start to come off. I think one has already snapped. Two more snaps and you'll die! - [gasps in shock] I don't understand a thing. Since three days, I'm getting whacked for something I didn't do. And you've removed our kidneys and blackmailing us. Don't be scared. It's very simple. Who among you kidnapped the girl... if you agree to it yourself, I'll put back the kidney as it was. You'll stitch it back again, is it? Sir! I kidnap children from the poor... and sell it to the riches who can't have children. Sir, because of me, many kids have become millionaires. Sir, I'm doing this as a service. Peg yourself to be Dr. A.P.J Abdul Kalam, is it? Bloody moron! Don't think they'll commemorate you with a statue. Listen, I have no idea about these two. But I didn't kidnap her. Then prove it wasn't you. How? What were you doing at that time on that day? I was on my way home to meet my wife. Give me your wife's number. -I'm your husband, Pratap. -I know, you pig. Tell me. Where did I come and meet you on Wednesday afternoon? Obviously you met me where I was at. I know, but mention the place. Hey, don't you know it yourself? How did you get there? It's better to live without one kidney than living with you. -Where were you? -I was drinking with a friend. Give me your friend's number. 90031 You guys still have time. If one among you agree to the crime... I'll return your kidneys and let you go. If not, I'll take another kidney too. Understood? Sir! I kidnapped her. Please forgive me. Sir, sir, please give our daughter back. Please give us back our daughter, brother. Sir, at least tell us where is she now? -Please, brother. -Please, sir. Sorry, I don't have your daughter with me. I handed over her to someone else. -To whom? -I have no idea. If there's a demand they'll call me. Then they'll give me a place for the drop. Then, they'll pay up and take the girl from me. Then, tell them, you'll return the money and ask them to return the girl. They won't return her. We can't even talk to them. Come on, stop begging to him. Shoot him down, if he doesn't return the girl. Immediately, they'll return the girl. Hey, if you threaten them, they'll ask you to shoot and hang up. Loser! Doctor, call them and say you have another girl for sale... and ask them to collect it. They'll come for it. [thrilling score begins] -Hello! -Brother, I have a girl for sale. She's around 10-11 years old. Do you wish to buy? Didn't you just sell one girl, day before yesterday? And you got another one already? At this rate you won't spare even one girl in this city. You're a great kidnapper! You're not just, Kannan. But,"Kidnapper-Kannan." Fine, I'll tell you tomorrow where to come. Okay. See, I have 15 years of experience in this industry. Now, return my kidney. I'll be on my way. No, brother. You're more experienced in this matter. So, until we find Chinnu. You better be with us. -And your kidney will be with him. -With him? Hey, stop kidding around. You promised to return the kidney, if I give you an idea. You'll take my idea and my kidney too. As if you're a great genius for us to celebrate you. Hey! If you keep rambling. Then I'll flush your kidney down the toilet. Have you gone mad? You're highly capable. Fine, you mentioned about another girl... -do you have one? -No! -She's right here. - [caws in shock] It's unfair that you made me disguise as a girl. Obviously, you can't pull off Kamal Hassan's look. Sir! Don't bother, sir. Have you practiced well to use the injection? Why don't you repeat it again? [comical score plays] Take a closer look. One: The needle should pierce well. Two: The medicine should enter the neck. One. Two... One. Two... That's so easy. Give it to me. Not a big deal. [imitates and hisses injection sound] What about driver? Driver! Oh, no, I'm sure this mental won't do it right. -I know. -What did you say? You just got pigtails, if we add flowers-- -Sit down. -You took it away. [car reversing sound] [car door opens and closes] [boot clicks opens] Hey, what an awful face! [hisses injection sound] Hey, what the hell are you spraying on my face? [comical score begins] [yells and groans in pain] You kept dodging when I tried to inject you. How dare you mock me? Hey, you didn't do it right and blaming it on him. Don't knock him too hard. He might forget everything. Hey, doctor, that girl-- Doctor, ask him where is the girl right now? The girl is not with me at the moment. I transferred her to someone else. Who is it? [boot click opens] Hey, that's an awful face. We can never do business with this face. [swats face] I'm not worth the business, is it? Do you expect me to abduct Trisha to run your business? Bhagat! He's been pissing me off! Call up the person, who has the girl now. Sir, we can't reach them over the phone. Then? They'll call us when required. They'll inquire about the availability. If we have the girls. They'll specify a place and a time. On that specified time, we should take the girls and make the drop. What else do you know about them? Sir, they're very dangerous. They don't feel any remorse at all. [ominous score begins] [whistle blows bus halts] [whistle blows bus revs away] [auto revs away] [trolley thuds] [ominous score intensifies] [container doors clang] [sniffles] What is it? Brother... Chinnu too does the same. She likes to lick horlicks out of her hand. When I look at you do the same... I got reminded of Chinnu. [sniffles and cries] I'm sure you won't remove Chinnu's kidney. Don't try to sass me. Get lost. And tend to the coffee. [phone rings] -Do you have a girl? -Yes, I do. Friday, night, 11:00 PM -At the Mahatma Gandhi bus stand. -Okay, sir. [thrilling score begins] [blaring horns] [hissing cooking hot slab] [trolleys bump] Sir, what are you doing? I'm taking my suitcase. Dear, what are you doing out there? Come over here. Sir, take your hands off. Madam, please get over to your suitcase. Sir, this is our suitcase. Let it go. Sir, when we bumped into each other. The suitcase got exchanged. Hey, don't piss me off, damn it! Speak with respect. Don't be rude! Dad, you please open the suitcase. Then we'll know whose it is. Sir, please don't meddle into things. I'm not meddling into things. -Let's call the police and settle it. -That's correct. Listen, they claim it's their suitcase. Let them take it. Please go ahead, sir. It's funny that I have to seek your permission to take my suitcase. Please leave, madam Come, dear, let's go. Please, leave madam. [thrilling score intensifies] [fast revving vehicles] [thrilling score ends] I have to wait for the practice. Hello. [thrilling score begins again] [metro zooms past] Varun, in 10 seconds we'll enter the tunnel. Everyone, please be ready. [loud rail tracks] [electronic score begins] [metro lights turn off rhythmically] Hey! Hey! Hey! That is not my problem. [electronic score ends] [screeching noise] [imitates dinosaur growl] [loud ringing noise] Watch and learn. I have 15 years of training. Now inject him. Come on, lie down over here. [yells and struggles] [lights come on] Who switched on the lights, before we finished injecting him? Oh, god! [Daniel] Varun. Varun, can you hear me? We'll hit the next tunnel in another 60 seconds. The next tunnel is 60 seconds away. How do we handle the next 60 seconds? Fight! Do you want to find, Chinnu, or not? Oh, no! Oh, my God! [baseball bat clangs head] I'm going to hook him and pin him down to the floor. Hit him with it. -Sorry, dear. -Hey, baldie, stand still. [growls angrily] Sorry. Oh, no! That was a strong punch. [yelps in pain] Hey, baldie! -Hey, Pratap! -What is it? -I saved you, Pratap. -Are you serious, Bhagat? Oh, no, your ear is bleeding. [metro lights goes off rhythmically] Damn it, people. Did you see what's happening? Why do we even have to endure this? You could've rather had another baby. To save your daughter, you're Giring my mother's son. Who will answer to my mother? Give me your address, I'll inform her. You won't be able to speak, when your mouth is broken. Bhagat! Doctor, here I'm. Tell me who should I beat up? Oh. no! It's pitch dark! How did they manage to hack down people in this dark? Doctor! Please return my glasses. Doctor, please ask them to switch on the lights. [yells and exhales in pain] Pratap. Pratap. Bhagat, keep quiet. -Pratap. -Keep quiet, Bhagat. -Pratap, doctor had called me. -Good. I went thinking it's an emergency. He took away my glasses. Bhagat! During the process of explaining, you took away my glasses. It's really dark. Please, return it. - [axe swinging sound] - Who's that? Excuse me. I know everyone is seated out here. I can't see at the moment. But I'm sure you can see me. You can hold my hand and help me sit. Instead, you guys are dead silent holding your breath. This isn't fair at all. Please, show me some mercy! Hel-- Baldie! Sorry, sir. I have nothing to do with that kid. It's just a rod! Just 'cause I'm helpless, you're taking advantage of me. Ameerpet! [light crackles on] They switched on the lights. Is it, interval now? [ominous score intensifies] You have our child. Give her up and I'll let you live. If you don't, then I'll slit your throat. Do you think we'll spill the beans, 'cause you're threatening to kill? Alvin, if he kills me, then you too slit your throat and die. [In Telugu] Don't give up the girl, at any cost. Just 'cause you asked him to die, do you think he'll do it? [In Telugu] Such a great bond you both hold, is it? Danny, doors open. [metro door hisses open] -I won't let go of you. -Let go! Melvin! Melvin! [screams aggressively] [ominous score ends] [yells and groans in pain] Hey! You're screaming on top of your voice for just two stitches. He ripped my flesh, removed kidney and bottled it up. Am I not calm? Stay calm, damn it! Screaming like a buffalo. Sister, please get me some water. Oh, God. Your eye is black and blue. You refused to get married to him, right? Now, no one will be willing to marry you. That includes me. [jar thuds on table] [hisses in pain] Doctor, even if we end up finding, Chinnu... you've turned us into something that no one will be able to recognize us. Educated people are always dangerous. You'll be fine in another 3-4 days. Until then, how do I present myself? As if anyone pays attention to you. [comical score begins] Doctor, it'll be great, if you could pass me some water. Since one hour I've been asking everyone. Get lost! Idiot. Doctor. "Idiot-Doctor." [stove hisses utensils clang] I thought you'll remove his kidney and extract information on Chinnu... but you're feeding him food. His brother is more important to him than his kidney. He'll confess soon enough. You better tend to the injured. - [phone rings] - [utensils clang] [phone rings again] [door creaks open] [ringing stops] [phone rings once again] [Melvin] Alvin! Alvin! Where are you? Please say something. [In Telugu] Tell me Alvin, where are you? Without you, I'm feeling very scared. Let's give up that girl. Let's return their daughter to them. Alvin, please say something. Pass me that phone. I will give up, Chinnu. [suspenseful music begins] [door thuds open] Tell me who's your daughter among these girls. -Hurry up, tell me who is it? -Hey, I saw, Chinnu. -Chinnu! -Ask him to go back. Come on, hurry up. I don't have time. Tell him that, Chinnu is behind him. Come on! -Chinnu is right out there. -Hurry up. Tell me fast! I don't have time. Hurry up! -Chinnu! -Please tell him. -I want you to give up all the girls. -What? All the girls? I got permission only for one girl. I can only take out one girl from here. Don't waste time. Make up your mind. -Please, sir, that's my daughter. -Come on, don't waste my time. -Tell me fast. -Chinnu! Give up all the girls. Release them all. What's wrong with you? We want only, Chinnu to be released. -Just ask for, Chinnu. -I can't do that. You've gone mad! Sir, he's ready to release one girl. Please ask him to release, Chinnu. In another 10 minutes, this container will be dispatched to Goa. Hurry up! Sir, please, sir. -Please, sir. -Come on, hurry up! Bhagat! Hey! [scalpel slits yells in pain] Stop it! -Stop! -Give up all the girls. Even if you kill me. He can't give up all the girls. That container is not under our control. -Sir! -Son, why are you being difficult? Didn't we work so hard to find our daughter? Now that she's right in front of our eyes, and you're not doing anything. You don't consider other girls as human beings? Can you give up all the 7 girls... [scalpel slits yells in pain] ...or not? I can't! What should I do, so that, I can free all the girls? If you wish to free them all. then you'll have to go to, Goa. -Hey! -Sir! Why do we have to listen to you all the time? To us only, Chinnu, matters! We really don't care what happens to the other girls. I don't need your permission to release that guy. Hey! [gasps heavily] You shouldn't be screaming like this for no reason. I'll hack you into pieces and put you inside a bottle. Mini, tell me what shall we do now? Why don't we just get, Chinnu, released. Oh, so the talks of love and affection limits to your family. Being selfish! You don't care a squat when it happens with the others. You're all talk, but no compassion. Aren't you ashamed? I care only about two things. We'll end up happy by saving all the 7 girls. Or we all die in the process of saving all the girls. That makes you an affectionate psycho! Brother, you've done a lot for this family. Please do us one last favor. I can't bear to see my daughter in this state. I beg of you, please help us. Please, bring our daughter back. Please save our daughter, brother. Sir, that's my daughter. Please, sir. It's Chinnu, sir. Please help us. Okay. I'll give you people another option, that might make you all happy. [drags stool tumbler clangs] [Intense score begins] I won't be at peace, if I abandon the other 6 girls. So, one of you pick up that gun and shoot me. And you can take back your daughter from them. God bless you! [score intensifies] Son, what's wrong with you? Don't waste time. Hurry up. I'm sure this gun has no bullets. That's why you're being so cool about it. Instead of going to prison for Giring you... I'd rather go to Goa. [uprising score plays] This is the plan. And this is how it's going to be done. Your plan maybe extensive. But the manpower is less. And this one, specifically is short as always. What do we do for others? Fold your legs, the doctor might perform a surgery on you. We'll find someone along the way. As if people are lining up to save your child. No one will agree to it. Agreed, they won't. We should offer something they won't refuse. But we need a scapegoat. [phone rings] He is not your father. And you're not her husband. And this madam is not her sister-in-law. To sum up, you people are not of the same family. You're pretending to be a family and kidnapping kids. Why is everyone hurt in some way or the other? Last week during a kidnapping we met with an accident. Who was driving? [yelps in shock] Don't you have any sense? There were so many women in the car... you should've been more careful. Look over there. A beautiful face has been scarred. [romantic score plays] You should whack him out of the house. We tried a lot, but he doesn't leave. You people are injured... you guys settle down over there. Tell me. What can I do for you? According to the information he received, a man has kidnapped and stashed a lot of girls in Goa. If we plan well and steal them away... he can't complaint to the police, also we won't face much of an issue. The total worth of those girls is 50 crores. According to your plan, we'll be at higher risk. I told you, right. They're small-time goons who play with sickles. If you speak to them about deals worth millions, they're bound to get scared. "A dog can only bark. Only a lion can kill." We can't use them to kidnap children. We can use their faces to scare off children. Time waste! [knife thuds pierces table] Hey, don't forget you're in my hood! -So? -Sir, please. It's okay. I usually don't give my word... and if by chance I do, then I'll fulfill it with my life. I'll fulfill it even if I'm dead. If you're dead, you can't fulfill it. -We can only light candles for you. -Correct! Hey, you've been giving your word like it's a piece of cake. It's not a child's play to get beaten up. Giri... I'll rip you apart. How do we split the share? 33% 33% 34% Let's do it this way. 40% 30% 30% [sniggers] It sounds like someone stealing a story and calling it their own. I bring the project to you guys. And you call the shots, is it? -I'm leaving. It won't work out. -Sir, please don't get angry. -I'll talk to him. -Carry on. Sir, I really don't care about the share. Your rapport matters the most to me. I want to use that to do bigger projects in future. So, 20% for me... 40% -40% -Wrong! Listen to this. 41% 21% 38% Hey, no one has ever split the share so bizarre. This is the first time I'm hearing about it. -[yells in frustration] -Senseless moron! -Sir, Pratap, sir, please! -Shut up, dude. I asked to split the share. But he's rambling landline numbers. -Such bizarre numbers. -Sir, excuse me. [fading footsteps] Why are you overdoing it? If you don't listen to him. I'll take out another kidney of yours. Listen, if I agree to all his terms... then he'll find out the ruse. Only if we twist him a bit, he'll come to our terms. -That's why I did it. -Why are you guys quarreling? We know that there's no actual money involved. It doesn't matter, even if we give him 100% share. -He'll be on-board in no time. -The entire 100% to him? "To give me 100% why are you guys betting your lives for this kidnapping?" Just for the sake of charity. Oh, god, he's incorrigible. Look, I'm ready to do anything you ask of me. Make sure he's not part of it. [whines with disappointment] I spoke to, sir. Your deal is fine with us. -Ask that girl to say the same. -Why? As the time goes by, rules with Mahali will keep changing. Wrong! I meant that girl. Thought as much. He looks like an auntie-hero! You say, my dear. Why are you seeking permission from him, as if he's your legal husband? -What's your name? -Sumathi. For Sumathi, I'm okay with this deal. What time are we leaving to Goa? GOA [upbeat reggae music plays] [phone rings] -Hello. - [Varun] I've emailed you a photo. The person in that picture will be at the resort too. Make sure he doesn't spot you guys. Careful. Okay. He has emailed a photo. He asked us to make sure we don't get spotted by that person. Excuse me. Hope, I didn't disturb you people. [tense score plays] Tamil? Are you coming to this resort for the first time? Thanks for choosing our resort. Goa is a very beautiful place. There are many things to see and explore out here. If you wish to explore something... you can contact the reception anytime. As you're at my resort for the first time... I would like to inform you, that your breakfast will be complimentary for the rest of your stay. So, please enjoy your stay with us. Thank you. [tense score intensifies] -Hello. -[Varun] Tell me. Actually, he spotted us. Great, please for god sake hang up the phone. One minute! But, like you mentioned, he doesn't seem to be a bad person. He looks like a decent man. Also, he's very sweet in nature. I hope we're doing the right thing. You too look like a genius. But are you? Follow the plan. Tonight at 10 PM. -[garbled car radio] -[car honks] Giri, imagine how it would be if we kidnap Sumathi instead of Mini. You'll be happy and I'll be pissed off. Look, stick to doctor's plan. When they look at the CCTV footage, it should look like real kidnapping. Wait and watch, I'm going to hold her by neck and kidnap her. -[ringtone plays] -That girl is calling us. Hello, it's the big car on the right side. I looking at you, keep true. It's the big car. You're heading the wrong way. Turn to this side. Come towards the car. I'm almost there, but you haven't opened the door. -Hey! -Come on, Mahali, nab her! [Mahali] Hey, Giri, my pants are stuck. [Mozart - Turkish March plays] [mechanical whirring] Oh, no, my daughter is missing. Did anyone see her? -Mr.Foreigner... -Check at the reception. -did you see her? -You people are irresponsible. My daughter went missing from your resort. I'm going to file a complaint with the police. I want to file a complaint right away. Sir, I can understand, sir. Please, give us some time. How can you ask me for time? It's my daughter who went missing. It's imperative that we complaint to the police. Are you going to help me or not? [sniffles and cries] Sir, I'm really sorry about this. It's not an ordinary thing for a girl to go missing. I can totally understand your pain. But please understand my situation. If you file a police complaint, the name of my resort will be in papers. And it will ruin my entire reputation. And it will ruin my entire business. Sir, trust me and give me 8 hours. I have many friends in the government and the police department. I'll handle this unofficially and find your daughter. Please, consider me as your son. And grant me some time. Sir, it's on the CCTV. [ominous score plays] [phone rings] Yeah, Terry. Gabbar, you have 6 hours. Find them. Okay! Giri, kidnapping the girl was not the big task. Now, they'll take us away and beat us to pulp. The more we bear it. We can earn their trust. Doctor, mentioned it. Doctor mentioned they'll be here before noon. It's 15 past noon, and no one is here yet. [door creaks open] [witty score begins] [thudding slaps] Where's the girl? Tell me! -Shall I confess, Mahali? -Don't confess, Giri. I've given my word. For Sumathi! You're too old to be romancing, damn it. Terry, if we beat them more, it'll be fatal. They're bloody scoundrels. Not able to break them. Boss, they're going to start afresh. -Get out! -Sir, please spare us. -Please! Sir! -Oh, no! [whimper and yells in pain] Mahali! Oh, God! Oh, no! Mahali! Mahali, let's confess it. -Don't. Please bear it all. -Mahali, let's confess. -I don't deserve this. -I've given my word. I don't deserve it. Oh, God. That's nasty. Word! Word! My nose! -Oh, no! -Boss, here use this. Damn it, he gave him a box to beat us. Oh, God, no! [door opens and closes] [profusely whimpers] [yelps and limps] [door creaks opens] -[pot cracks down loud] -[loudly yelps and runs] Bloody, scoundrel. -Let go of me. -Get inside, damn it. -Oh, no! -You wanna try this? I appreciate that you're not confessing it for my sake. I love you! Damn it, I forgot why we're getting beaten up. Why don't you give me some clue? Hey, give me that knife. He's getting a knife. -He's bringing a knife, damn it. -Knife! I'll confess. I'll confess. I'll confess. [road traffic] Ice creams. Welcome, sir. Hello. -Yes, sir. -I need to talk to you. I don't understand. You know Tamil, right. Shall we talk? I can get you anything that's on the menu. Vanilla, strawberry, butterscotch, vanilla truffle, chocolate truffle, strawberry mousse. Tell me what you want? [blaring horns road traffic] [fusion music plays] Shut down the shop stating maintenance and get rid of the customers. Come inside. What do you want? Where's the girl you kidnapped last night from my resort? That girl has been transferred elsewhere. Ask me for something else. I can't leave without the girl. Like I mentioned, I can't bring back the girl. Please leave. [gun swishes] Hey! Sir. Sorry, sir. It was a mistake. Please forgive him. -[loud thud shot fired] -Oh, God, no! Oh, God, no! Hey! [wails in hushed tone] Oh, God, no! -Oh, God, no! -How dare you rat me out? [continues to wail in pain] I'm okay with what happened. But one thing I don't get it. If you were truly a resort-owner... you would've filed a complaint with the police. Instead, you seek me out and you're here to discuss terms with me. What I don't get is, how come a resort-owner is go gutsy? Either you're police or a criminal. If you are police... [loud creak and door latches] I'm not police. That I can promise you. But I want to tell you something. It really doesn't matter if you are a big gangster... you can't step out of Goa, if you shoot me dead. All you need is just any girl. But I want the girl you've kidnapped. I'll give you a girl. You return that girl to me. Problem solved. How come a resort owner is into kidnapping? You own a ice cream parlor. And I own a resort. That's the only difference. Do you still think I'm a fool to believe your stories? You don't have to believe what I'm saying. But, you'll believe your eyes, right? [uprising score plays] Keep 200m radius and follow them. -How long have you been doing this? -12 years! I'm 10 years senior to you. Oh! Keep the target in sight. Okay, sir. Don't get too close to the target. [uprising score intensifies] Target on sight. [speed boat gushes through the sea] Boys you know the drill. On my command! [access panel pings] [iron door clangs open] Number 3! Number 2! The target is at, 37°06' 43'' W [iron door clangs open] [window pane opens] [emotional score plays] You can pick any girl you want. They're very young girls. Until they hit puberty, we keep them here. Only, after that I export them. Virgin-export. That's the current demand. I thought you said you're 10 years senior to me. But your actions state something else. What makes you say that? You've hardly known me for 2 days. But you've already shown me your vital hideout. What if I turn out be the police? Then, what would you do? If you're truly police, what would you do? I would've come with the force. Once I got settled inside, I would've informed them. They would've barged in and took control over this place. How long would it take to control? 20-30 minutes. Gabbar! -[radio hisses] -Nazeer! [heavy iron lid scrapes open] [loud thud] [metal object scraping] [metal object falls with loud thud] [yells out help] In just 2 minutes, I would've disposed everyone into the ocean. Just like how they found Titanic... it would take years for them to recover them. Smart. [message chimes] Okay, listen all units. DC has a fail-safe. -What? -Abort plan! [sniper clicks] I feel ashamed to have done this to one of our own. I'll return that girl. You don't have to do anything in return. After looking at your grandeur set-up, I have an offer for you. What is it? In another 10 days I have to ship 70 girls from India to Brazil. I have 30 girls with me. Can you give me 40 girls? I'm ready to pay any price for that. I know it's tough. Only, if you can pull it off, say okay. [tense score intensifies] I don't know what else is out there. So, let's not risk it. You guys can leave. Thanks for coming. We can plan and execute it meticulously. Hear me out! Colonel, more than courage we need intelligence out here. It's fine, if you or I die in the process. But young lives are involved. -So, let's not risk it. -Talk like a military man. Risk is a given. I don't want a plan that saves only 8 out of 10 lives. I want a plan that can save all 10 lives. I'll do what suits me the best. I don't need your advice. You don't have the experience that I have in this. You will regret this. Goodbye! It's better think about it ten times... before you take a giant leap. You've just known him for 2 days. And already he has huge demands. What if he's a fraud? The girls we kidnapped are not going to go for a waste. Only after we receive the full settlement... we'll deliver the girls, If he turns out to be a fraud, we'll burn him alive out here. But if he's genuine, that'll open up a new market for us. Our business will have a wider reach. Okay. Let me meet him once. An ice-cream vendor indulging in large scale human trafficking... I'm finding it hard to believe. A person who is running a huge human-trafficking network... also owns a ice cream shop. Is this believable, uncle? 100% Only after you settle the payment, we'll board the girls on to the containers. If this works for you... offer, okay! Deal, okay! But, before we finalize the deal... you'll have to speak to our boss. Okay, we'll talk to him. But before you speak to him, bear two things in your mind. One: You can answer only if you're questioned by him. Two: you have to call him, Don Pablo El-Fino! Don Pablo El-Fino Repeat it. -We'll repeat it to him. -No! No! He doesn't like it, if you mispronounce his name. So, you'll have to repeat it. Don Pablo El-Fino Don Pablo El-Fino, hola! [speaking in Spanish] Don Pablo El-Fino, hola! What happened? Why did he shut it down? One minute. Dad, why didn't you repeat what I taught you? Son, he's a useless supporting actor. You chose a wrong person to act. Hang up the phone. Wear your veshti! -You get your payment and leave. -Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. The deal is off. Let's end it here. Why is the deal off? My boss is not able to trust you. He believes that you can't pull off a project of this magnitude. In how many days did you need the girls? In 10 days. I'll get them to you in 5 days. Terry... call all of our men, tomorrow. Speak to them in Varun's presence. Sixth day from today... the girls would've been shipped. Then, I'll speak to your boss. You've been conning them profusely. What if he finds out? Definitely, he'll find out. And when he does, he'll kill all of us. Then why are you doing this? But it'll take time for him to find out. By then, we would've finished our mission and escaped. The plan-B is now in motion. You guys start your game! [waves crashing] They're going to ask me crazy stuff like you know... like, say-- [yelps in pain] -It's hurting, damn it. -You wanted to act, right? So, endure it. -Enough! Take the money. -Thank you. [blows over hand] Bloody, you broke my hand. I'll practice well and return tomorrow to defeat you. You'll wake up in the morning. But I doubt your hand will. I'm going to break it. I'll break all 10 fingers. I'm going to break his hands too. I won't spare him. -You can't defeat him in this life. -Why? You gotta be fast like a tiger! But you're... [squeals mockingly] ...tortoise. Go and apply some coconut oil on your hands. Don't worry. You'll be fine. Small bugger! Hey, it's easy to speak, damn it. But in action, you can't do squat. -Do you know who is he? -Who? You don't know his strength. Try challenging him. -I don't have money, bro. -I'll lend you. [Bhagat] There are 5 rules to follow. Listen carefully. Rule #1: Once the game begins, the first person to tear up will lose. Rule #2: Freedom of speech. To distract the opponent, you can do trash talk. Rule #3: Without completing the challenge, if you pick up your gun or knife out of anger... you won't be considered as a man and will be pronounced as a women and we'll pin flowers to your head. Your name will be changed to, Gomathi. And you'll have to wear yellow color, Pommy's night dress. Yours Truly, Slap-Hand Association. Both of you, come inside. First, do you wish to touch my hand? Come on, take a look. Hey, he's mocking you and you're giving him a chance. You should never lose your focus. Okay, okay. I'll take care. Don't just blurt out words. Prove it in action. [loud thudding clap] [loud thudding slap] Are you a doctor? He's a doctor and I'm the police. You don't need to know. Bloody, you have soft hands. He broke your hands in just one blow. -[yells out in pain] -Okay! Okay! If you look at the procedure, you may get scared. Bhagat, pick up that towel and hold it in front of his face. He couldn't stand a chance. But came down preaching me about fighting. Bloody, broke his hand with just one blow. Useless moron! [whimpers in pain] [comical score plays] We'll run a check-up after two weeks. Until then, please be careful. I have another request. It's better to bury the hatchet. Don't pull in more people into this mess. Understood? Don't bring more people to fight him. [footsteps approaching] Have a seat, please. Everybody, meet Mr.Varun. Our new associate. We'll be venturing into a new market, with his support. Now the reason you have been called here today... is to inform that each one of you have to deliver 5 girls in 5 days. I know that it's not an easy task. But we have no choice. As promises have been made. Thank you all for coming. Terry... need to talk! Varun, please join us. [suspenseful music plays] Terry, the appointment has been fixed at 4 pm in the evening. Okay. Thanks. I have known, Melvin, for 7 years. Where's Alvin? He's not well. Actually, they're twins! Powerful. Smart. And more importantly, loyal. Oh! [score intensifies] What is it, tell me? I've been facing some issues. I won't be able to deliver the 5 girls, you had asked for. I need some time. Cookies. [knife swishes chair drags and thuds] What are you doing? You were not in touch with Alvin for two weeks. Neither there has been any activity from your side. So, someone is holding Alvin as hostage... and has sent you to kill me. Who is that? If I reveal it, they'll kill, Alvin. I can't reveal their identity. Tell me what I have to do now? Give up all the girls you've kidnapped. And drop them off from where you abducted them. Don't be scared. Tell me who is it? There's no way you can save us. They're very close to you. Who is that big-shot? That's the problem. They're not big-shot. They're ordinary people. Before you could find them... they would've destroyed you. Excuse me. [knife swishes] [knife slits] You killed him! He gave me a clue, already. That's enough. This the last batch of girls delivered by Melvin. Family and friends of these girls... I want to know where and what are they doing at the moment? You have 3 days time. Hey, are you going to hover the sambhar over to me? Got hurt, Gabbar. You chill! -What happened? -I left my hand into the door. So, does that mean your eyes were stuck up the butt. Maybe. Get lost! Hey, pour me some sambhar. Why are you walking like you're on a ramp? Remove your hands. -What happened to you? -I bit my hands while having food. I bit my hand so I used the other to eat... and ended up biting that hand too. Shall I feed you? Then, you can bite my hands too. Bloody, get lost! What are you guys up to? Everyone is hurt in the same manner. Are you taking money from me and working for someone else? -[clicks gun] -Tell me! Tell me, damn it! Brother, it's a game. Game? -Slap-Hand! -Slap-Hand? What is that? [loud thudding slap] Aren't you ashamed to have broken your hands over this game? If this happens again, I'll fire everyone. Get lost! Listen, Gabbar. I'm leaving this job, right away. Bye guys! What are you going to do after quitting the job? I'm going to seek revenge. And I'm going to break his hand. I can't take this anymore. The things he said about mom, I will never forget until I die. Who the hell is it? He has messed up everyone. Brother, he's a nobody. Let it go. Let it go? Hey, he swore at my mother. What did my mom do? Can you stay calm, if he had swore at your mom? I'm going to break open his head. Have you gone mad? Mad? I don't think you get it properly. In the end, he mentioned one thing... he's asking for men to face him. To me! Where will I go for men? Do I look like a women to him? Do you have any men? Where the hell can I find him? Sir, this is a silly game. This game doesn't suit you. I heard that no one can defeat you. I want to defeat you. That's a silly wish. If you can't, then you might harm me later. I'm scared! I have to play this game. What sir? - I have to break your hand. Sir, please don't do it. Sir, please don't do it. Sir, sir, please, sir. Hear me out, don't do it. You've entered the ring! Sir, only one leg is inside the ring. If you wish to play, hop in with both the legs, damn it! Bloody, hulk, step inside. I'll be respectful only outside the ring. Once you step in, I won't respect you. Do you have grudge against him? You got him webbed now. -Who's going first? -Come on, Gabbar. -Yes! -You're too bulked up. -But no play. -Come on, Gabbar. Concentrate. -Come on, bring it on! -Ready? [intimidating noises] [everyone yells in excitement] Keep at it. You're doomed, man! -Look at his physique. -Don't give up. That's the way. Your hand will turn inwards. [imitates cuckoo noise] Pratap, your hands and legs are shivering. [yells aggressively] -Awesome! -Oh, no! -He's striking like a lightning. -Come on, Gabbar! You broke everyone’s' hand in the city. Life is a boomerang! Come on, break his hand! That's a lot of spit. Gabbar, he's playing dirty. He might even end up peeing on you. Make sure you're ready to face anything. Sir, let not do it. I'm really scared. -I don't want to do it. -What? I don't get it. Hey, he's just too great a fighter. I told you right that he'll distract you. -I'm going to rip you apart. -Faster! -I'm going to break your hands. -Come on, brother! Hey, focus on his hands, damn it Bloody poker face. I'm going to thrash you. Gabbar, quick. Take you hands away. Keep at it! No matter how much you hit me, I can bear the pain. You'll bear the pain, is it? Wait and watch, not just your eyes will tear up... but they'll gouch out of your skull. [thunderous slap] He's crying. Hey, I'm not crying. Oh, really? Your tears have rolled down to your pants. Gabbar, you cried. It's over. Don't fool around. -Hey, I'm not crying. -Gabbar, don't lie. Why are you being so stubborn? Useless bull! Don't you understand, damn it? Gabbar, uncle bit the dust. Gabbar, sir, didn't you read the rules? Flowers are pinned to his head. Gomathi, sister, why are you staring at me? Rightfully, you should be staring at your men. But if I mention one thing, you might get angry. But that's a fact. These flowers look beautiful on you. Can I take a selfie with you? [hammer mildly thuds] Gomathi, does it hurt? Gomathi, I'm speaking to you. Does it hurt? She'll tell you if it really hurts. Stop tapping on the hand and begin the procedure. Gomathi, sister, please let us know, if it hurts. -[ominous score plays] -[gasps in shock] Pratap! [yelps in shock] Please, open this. -Put it inside. -Me? I won't be good, if Gomathi looks at it. Put it inside. [ominous score intensifies] Now, you can continue to apologize. I don't see a need for it now. Maybe I'll get some jasmine, you can insert them into his nose. Hey, can't you close the door, when you're on the toilet. -I thought of something. -What is it? What if all them belong to the same family. And one of their own went missing and they set out to look for her... and hired us 'cause they were short of people. Hey, why would you think something like that? Obviously, from the looks of it, I don't feel we're here to kidnap. It looks like we're here to save someone. There's no logic to what you're saying. If so, then whose daughter is it? Obviously, it's Sumathi's daughter. Hey, Sumathi, doesn't look like a married woman. She looks like a student doing her 2nd year in college. Right! She's in 2nd year. And you're in 1st year and I'm in kindergarten. Mahali, our lives are at stake. Giri, my love is at stake. -Hey, get lost. -If she comes to know, she'll be hurt. [comical music plays] Sorry, please don't take it to your heart. He's a fool. He was wrong, but you caught it right. That's why you are the boss! Hats off! Such a meticulous plan... but he deduced it sitting on a commode. Actually, he's the boss! And it's better for us, if we lock him inside the toilet. [door squeals close] Terry, that girl's family is staying at our resort. [golf ball rolling into the hole] You guys are hogging like mad. No one seem to care, if he has eaten or not. Are you worried about him? Isn't he working hard for our sake? When he can do so much, he surely knows how to eat too. You better eat. Park the romance for now. And focus on finding your niece. [indistinct chatter] Everyone, sit down. [suspenseful music plays] [suspenseful music intensifies] [Nenjame vocals] I'm sure they're not capable of pulling it off. There's someone above them calling the shots. What if it's him? I feel he's the root cause for all our problems. Then, invite him for the lunch too. [slurping soup] Sit. [spoon falls and clatters] -[slap thuds] -[yelps in pain] [continues slurping] If someone slaps a girl, people tend to look at it. Instead, if you continue to eat soup, won't he suspect us? If you could reach at my dining table, with fools like him... you must be a dangerous criminal. What if I'm truly a dangerous gangster? Unaware, you might kill me. The my men might come and kill you all. What would you do, then? Do you think I'll believe you? You did believe me all this while. Mahali... as he knows everything, he won't believe me it seems. I don't get it. I conned him just like I conned you. You couldn't find out. But he found out. Did you con us? -Hey, Giri. -Last night I warned you. But now you look shocked! At least follow now and see if you can make sense of it. What about Sumathi? Sumathi, Gomathi were part of the plan. Pass me the pepper. It's your last supper. Have and die. [gasps and falls] [shots fired] Not bad, I can see fear in your eyes. Don't worry, I won't kill her. She is business. But, I'll kill each one of you. Not like you expect it to be. But, like how I wish it to be -[birds calling] -[ferry engine whirrs] [mellow comical score plays] How long will it take? I'm asking, 'cause I'm feeling nauseous. Do you at least have lemons? [sniffles and cries] I'm the reason, you people are in this mess. Let me apologize to everyone. Please! Hold on, dear. You don't have to apologize to me. Do you know why? It's 'cause you're your mother's daughter. [grunts] Okay, uncle. Do you what that makes you? That makes you Sumathi's brother. I even got beaten up in the process. I even got bitten twice. I should be apologizing to you. I failed in this mission to save you. -As a police-- -At least don't lie to the kid. As a friends of police, I feel ashamed to have failed you. -Uncle. -Shut up, don't call me, uncle. Can't you wait for your folks once the school is over? You left the school. And someone kidnapped you. And to save you, he kidnapped me. Now, someone has kidnapped all of us. Such an annoying kid. To hell with your sorry. Get lost! It's been 6 months since I went home. I know you too have the same opinion about me. Do you even know why I left early from school? In my family, except for me, no one else will support you. If I'm gone too, then you'll be left in despair. Do you know why I came looking for you? I know. You did it for Mini. No, I did it for you. You swear? I like you a lot, Chinnu. Thanks. [loud waves crashing] [firewood clattering] [whimpers and cries] Oh, you're going to burn us alive. Great, I'll burn and take solace in the flames... and dance my heart away. Look, what your love has done to us. Hey, why are you being stingy with the logs? Get more to burn us. I think I'll die of heat before you guys burn me down. Picked the wrong day to wear tight undies. Put some wood out here. Dude, help me out. Make sure the knot is tight. If not, I might fall into the sea. Hey, stop right there. I think he wants a re-match. I'm going to rip him apart. All these years, I never asked you for anything. But now, I have a request. -[bell tolling] -[wails in pain] [sniffles] Brother, can you do me one last favor? Even in this dire situation? Please you move to the other side and let Varun come to this side. [frustrated grunt] Brother, can't you grant me this one last favor? Sister, they have crucified me. And you expect me to move around. Don't you have any conscience? Shut up and stay put. Then ask Varun to come to this side and you get to the other side. Do you think he's comfortable and cozy out there? Can't you see that he's been tied up too? We're about to die and you're in a romantic mood. I'm on my death bed. Please don't irritate me. Did you say you're at Begumpet? -[yells out in frustration] -Help me lord! Fine, look at him. Your hair is blocking my view. I don't have time to cut my hair. Mad woman, make the best out of the situation. Varun! Varun, unintentionally I've troubled you a lot. Please, forgive me! [whimpers and cries] -Chinnu, don't be scared. -Mom! Stay strong as always. My blessings will always be with you. Chinnu... when we're on fire, please close your eyes. Close your ears too. When I'm on fire, I'll scream like hell. [crying intensifies] Hey, bring me the petrol. -Ready! -Go and get my father. [switchblade clicks] [plaster tears] [switchblade clangs] ERROR [ominous score plays] [door slides open] [shot fired] Head-shot! What the shit? To complete this operation, you performed that operation. Oh! [ominous score intensifies] Sir. Your father is inside that bag. Think about it. Alvin, I'm sure you must be aware... that he must've manipulated me to kill Melvin. Sir, I might say a million things to survive. That doesn't mean you can kill his brother. Or do you think he'll spare you for Giring his brother? Alvin, let's discuss this among ourselves. -But, first let's kill them all. -How is that possible? If he has put your dad inside a bag and is pointing a gun at him... this is all part of my meticulous plan. So, I believe he must be a bit loyal to me. In case, out of anger if I ask him to shoot... he might shoot him. It was you who had mentioned... that he's very loyal. Set them free. [shackles drop] [cheerful score plays] You guys settle your score. We're leaving. Alvin, I know that you're outraged. So, I'll make you a better deal. Spare my father, and kill me instead. If I kill you... then how will you realize the pain of losing a loved one? So, this has to happen. As in? [trolley bag thuds and rolls] [shots fired] Mom, I think we left one girl, behind. Fine, the kids are hungry, please ask them to hurry up. It's just one girl. We managed to save the others. If you go back to save that one girl... you won't come back alive. Take it that I'm being selfish. I want to get married to you. [romantic score plays] I want to live with you. Sir. Sir, can we hold this girl as hostage to bring him back? I'm in this state, 'cause I hired fools like you. After such a debacle... do you really think, he'll come back for her? Fool! -[shot fired] -[uprising score plays] I left one girl behind. I'm here to take her with me. [grim score plays] How dare you came back for her? You took away all the girls from me. You killed my father too. And now, you're here to take away that one last girl too. I don't get it. What gave you the courage? Who the hell are you? Police? Intelligence Bureau? R.A.W? Who are you? Doctor! You came here prepared to die. If I shoot you right now, you'll die in peace. So, before you die... witness the girl getting hacked into pieces. Nazeer! [wails and cries] [breathes heavily] You returned to save her, right? Nazeer, kill her! [Soul of Doctor] [chokes and yelps] [unholsters guns] [thuds and fall] -[re-loads guns] -Hold! He has to witness the girl getting hacked, before he dies. Michael, come on, hack her down. [shots fired] Until I'm alive... it's impossible to kill that girl. If you wish to kill that girl... you'll have to kill me first. Kevin. -[shot fired] -[yelps and falls] Shoot me... ...and take her! Terry, I'm very sorry for saying this. You're tripping on ego. It's not safe for us. First let's kill him then we'll kill the girl. My point exactly. [machine gun fires] [loud explosion] [metal door clangs bricks clatter] -[light flickers] -[multiple footsteps approaching] [uprising score plays] [bazooka fires] [loud explosion] This was never part of the plan. I'm also surprised like you. It is the result of my good deeds. That has saved me today. Anyway... Goodbye! Thanks. Doctors are not the only saviors. Even the doctors need saviors! Guys, let's finish this! [Soul of Doctor] THREE MONTHS LATER Hyderabad [traditional wedding music plays] [phone rings] -Hello. -Bhagat, at least now return the kidneys. Fool, that's why education is important... instead, you were loafing around. And now, making my life difficult. It's impossible to take out kidneys, just like that. I don't understand. He just slit your abdomen and stitched it up. That's it! Your kidney is safe and sound. Scan and check for yourself. Bloody, don't call me again. Son, the police is here. [clears throat] Didn't you people file a missing complaint? Don't you follow-up after filing a complaint? I'm speaking to you people. So, we gotta work hard, nab the accused and present to you. We found the kidnapper. -How did he find him? -Hey, bring him out. [clears throat] Bloody! Oh, they've just caught him now. I think it'll take another 5 years to find, Terry. By that time, even Chinnu would've got married. Ignore him. Auspicious time is about to end, you first get married. Go on your honeymoon, create tik-tok videos and send it to me. I'll enjoy watching them. Tik-tok has been banned, Bhagat. What? When did they ban, tik-tok? Who gave them permission to ban it? I never got an email. Forget tik-tok, we'll shoot a duet live!
