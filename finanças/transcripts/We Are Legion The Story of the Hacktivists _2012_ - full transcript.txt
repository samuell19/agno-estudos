It was 6:00 in the morning. I got a knock on my door... a really loud knock... and I thought it was my dad, who had locked himself out or something. So I opened it, and it's the. I.e.d. Flashlights and the really obnoxious bullet-proof vest and the dragging me out into the cold when I'm in my pajamas. That was not fun. They seemed pretty shocked by the sarcastic, belligerent, angry teenager that they dragged out of bed that day. I don't know if it's just that I was 19 or that I was a girl, but they didn't expect... This. 10,000 angry kids... whoever they are, they scared the shit out of some people those days. They scared the shit out of the powers that be, and that's why this is being investigated. That's why I'm under indictment. That's it, because between the days of December 6th and December 10th, 10,000 angry people proved to the government that their regulations, their ideas, their view of PayPal, their view of wikileaks, their view of the Afghan war, and Egypt and Tunisia and Libya... It didn't... Matter. Their opinion no longer mattered because someone was out on the Internet kicking ass. The computer hacker group anonymous is claiming tonight that it took down the website of the federal appeals court in San Francisco this afternoon. They took down senate. Gov servers, they've taken down hbgary, Sony's claiming they did $150 million worth of damage. So many confidential files that tonight, because of these hackers, can be in the hands of anyone. Visa, mastercard, the PayPal situation. The criminals who hacked into Sarah Palin's private e-mail. The church of scientology says anonymous is a cyber-terrorist group of religious bigots. Anonymous and this other group called lulzsec... they seem to be wanting to prove a point. Anonymous kind of was like the big, strong, buff kid who had low self-esteem, and then all of a sudden, punched somebody in the face and was like, "holy shit, I'm really" strong!" And anonymous calls itself "the" "final boss of the Internet," and sometimes if proves to be really fucking true. If you are going to violate the freedoms of the Internet, you certainly better watch the fuck out. They are kind of the rude boys of activism. There's a real rough edge to them, which I think also is one reason why they garner so much love and hate from people, too. They represent a certain sort of chaotic freedom. Individual, young, nameless, faceless folks are having geopolitical impact. I mean, it's both exhilarating to realize that and terrifying to realize that. It kind of depends on how that power is wielded. We are legion. We do not forget. Expect us. We stand for freedom. We stand for freedom of speech, the power of the people, the ability for them to protest against their government, to right wrongs. No censorship, especially online but also in real life. We have members throughout society, in all stratas of it worldwide. Yeah, we have no leadership. It's one voice... it's not individual voices. That's why we don't show our faces, that's why we don't give our names. We're speaking as one. It's a collective. Good timing. I got called a terrorist sympathizer. We've been called kids, we've been called cyber-bullies, we've been called hooligans, and, you know, sometimes those words aren't entirely unfair, but this is a serious political movement. No one in the general public really seems to get it. What they don't seem to get is that the ability for anonymous to be everything and anything is it's power. Anonymous is a series of relationships... hundreds and hundreds of people who are very active in it, and who have varying skill sets, and who have varying issues they want to advance and who are collaborating in different ways each day. They're a little bit like a prism or a kaleidoscope... They're got many different facets and many different sides. Of course, when you spend enough time with them, you start to get a sort of feel or texture that's not just random, right? Yet it's very multifaceted, very rich, which does span from the quite lighthearted to the very, very serious. Bob Dylan had a line in his song, to sing, "to live outside" the law, you must be honest." They might do something which isn't technically correct, maybe it's not legally correct, but they're doing it for purposes that, in their minds at least, are ethical. People who know what they're doing, who share an ethos, who have a commitment to exposing and humiliating "the man," who have a very low tolerance of lies and what they perceive as evil on the part of overweening power structures. They share information, they share tools and techniques, and they are currently having a very good time. They hacker culture, as we know it, really sprang from one place. It was m.I.T., and it was specifically the people in the model-railroad club, the tech-model-railroad club. Hacking originated as humorous pranks when the guys at m.i.t. Put a Volkswagen up on top of the dome of the building, and people woke up and saw the car up there in the morning. Or they measured a bridge by the body lengths of somebody, I would say his name was Brian, and discovered the bridge over the Charles river was 822 Brians. These are funny things. That's where hacking originated, and it migrated into engineering and computer communities. It's witty. It's pranks. Basically, Microsoft and apple both got their entire start off computer crime. Bill Gates stole pretty much all of ms-dos. Steve Jobs... he was creating boxes to defraud the phone company. I always saw hacking as implicitly political. Hackers, whether they're conscious about it or not, whether they're explicit about it or not, make a statement about how we should treat information. And some years after my book came out, one of the people I wrote about, Richard stallman, got very publicly and explicitly political about software. And he believed that software should be free... free as in freedom, not free as in beer, as he put it there. Behind it, whether misguided or not, there's a political impulse. I'm Chris wysopal, former member of the lopht. We don't necessarily say "hacking group" because it makes it sound like we're hacking, so we used to call it "a hacker's think tank." "Hacktivism" was a term coined by a group called "the cult of the dead cow." The lopht had an interesting relationship with the cult of the dead cow. Actually, there were some members that were in both organizations. And we kind of kept, like, the serious security research that they were doing, they would do under the lopht name, and if they were doing some sort of just goofy stunt-like things, they would do it under the cult of the dead cow name, because the cult of the dead cow was really kind of sort of like a propaganda type of organization. They had a guy who was the minister of propaganda. They're kind of merry pranksters, like everything they did was completely over the top. One of the guys there coined the term "hacktivism" because he saw one of the things his group was doing, which he called "hacktivism," was writing software that people in other countries could use to communicate securely, even if their government was spying on them. So the principle was really freedom of expression. It was everyone should have access to the Internet, everyone should be able to communicate and get their message out on the Internet, even more important, in countries where there was repressive regimes that if you said something against the regime, they would come and take you away and you weren't saying it anymore. "Hacktivism" has often meant to designate a form of political activity in which technology assistance is used for human-rights activism. That's kind of the narrow sense of the word. It usually stays within the purview of the law... usually, because by providing technological assistance, you may be breaking a local law, however. And yet, other forms of digital interventions, protest, dissent, disobedience are clearly pushing the boundaries of the law, are seeking to actively break the law in protest, or are just merely transgressive, as well. Just like in traditional activism, it spans the full gamut from sit-ins or pickets to actually spiking trees and pouring sand in the engines of construction vehicles. I mean, there's real sabotage. The same thing does all fall under the "hacktivism" label. There is a spectrum. A good place to start are with what has often been called virtual sit-ins, which use the tactic of a denial of service attack. Denial of service has been around for a long, long time. The equivalent of if you, for some reason, wanted to disrupt a bus service, right? You can hire a thousand extras to all go and line up at the bus station and get on the bus. And so then anyone who was really trying to get on the bus couldn't do it. It's as simple as that... when you stop trying to visit, website goes back up, no permanent damage. And this tactic has been used by a number of different groups. Probably the most famous is the electronic disturbance theater. Another really interesting case happened in Germany where a group of activists got together who wanted to protest the fact that the airline lufthansa... They were using their planes to deport immigrants. And they would take down the site. And, in fact, eventually, the German courts ruled that this could be a legitimate form of protest. This sometimes has strong anarchist flavor to it, as well. It's resistance to authority and those who would impose group-think and group-behavior on the people, which was rightly perceived to be a consequence of the digital revolution as it was used by people in power... to do hacking on behalf of righteousness and to redress the grievances of the world. Lance-lowered Don quixote on his horse, nag though she was, flying at the windmills of modern life. Anonymous grew out of what's know as 4chan. And essentially, this is just a website where people can upload images and you don't actually give your name, it's just sort of anonymous. When you look at 4chan, you're often surprised because it looks like a site from like 1995 or something. The idea is very simple... you post a comment and you post a picture, and you can post under your name or anonymously. And it's separated into boards about particular topics, so there's a topic on anime, there's a topic on weaponry. There's like a 4chan board for origami and you just upload interesting pictures of origami. And then, there was a group called the "/b/ board," which essentially was for, like, anything goes. The first time anybody goes on /b/, it's kind of an instant revulsion, 'cause there's never a time that you go on there where you don't see something horrible. That instantly puts off a lot of people. The idea is post something that can never be unseen. Half of the posts on /b/ are there specifically to make people not want to come back to /b/. Have you ever read "lord of the flies"? 4chan and especially /b/ is "lord of the flies," except some of them aren't 16 anymore. They're just allowed to act 16. It's the most vile, disgusting, and funny thing on the Internet. 4chan was founded by Chris "moot" poole when he was very young, maybe 15, in the early 2000s. He started 4chan because he was a big fan of Japanese animation. Chris "moot" poole's the sweetest kid you've ever met in your life. He's small, and he's, like... He's got these sort of like tiny features, and he runs the most disgusting website in the world. What I think is really intriguing about a community like 4chan is just that it's this open place. As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered, and sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking. We're moving towards persistent identity. We're moving towards, you know, a lack of privacy, really. The /b/ board... that's the exact opposite of Facebook. Facebook, you're supposed to be who you are and there's sort of one model, which is that you're friends with people, right? In 4chan, you're a totally anonymous nobody. And anonymous speech is... a lot of it's ugly, but not all of it is. It's actually sort of a place where people can be honest. One of the important things about 4chan is to have a thread that really explodes and lasts for a long time. 'Cause if it doesn't, then it disappears... it's a site that's not archived. So it creates conditions for anything that grabs attention, at some level, and so humor and grotesqueness, as a result, are quite good for that. I'd rather just be referred to as anonymous, I guess, in the interviews 'cause I have some docs out on me. You'll see something posted one day, and then a week later it's got 50,000 derivatives of it. A lot of the great Internet memes that we all know and love, you know, lolcats, right, you know, little cats doing funny things and then they have "I can" "has cheezburger," right? All that stuff seems to start in this petri dish that is 4chan, /b/ board. ♪ Say it publicly, and you're insane ♪ ♪ Chocolate rain ♪ Name any meme from the last about six years, and I'll bet you, either in it's first posting ever was on 4chan, or at least one of it's earliest revisions that became what it was was on 4chan. I can see the food situation is so we'll be on our way. ♪ Never gonna give you up ♪ ♪ Never gonna let you down ♪ It's basically the best breeding ground for Internet culture, as far as I'm concerned. ♪ With your neighborhood insurance rates ♪ ♪ Chocolate rain ♪ 4chan is also very known for acts of trolling. For them, it's funny, that people think the Internet is serious business. And if people think the Internet is serious business, it's a troll's job to make their life terrible. The idea of anonymous came initially as a joke. I mean, somebody suggested that, "what if the whole site, what if" 4chan, what if /b/ was just one person, and what if that's just one guy called anonymous sitting somewhere and you're just reading all these posts by one "guy?" And it kind of looked like that, from the outsider's perspective. I mean, there's no way to tell the difference. It might as well be one guy. Fox news did a very famous segment about it. They call themselves "anonymous." They are hackers on steroids, treating the web like a real-life video game... sacking websites, invading MySpace accounts, disrupting innocent people's lives, and if you fight back, watch out. Threats from a gang of computer hackers calling themselves "anonymous." I've had seven different passwords, and they've got them all so far. Anonymous hacked his site and plastered it with gay-sex pictures. His girlfriend left him. She thought that I was cheating on her with guys. As long as I can think back, anonymous has done some pretty off-color things in the name of getting cheap laughs, you know? But, I mean, that's part of the culture. They get what they call "lulz." "Lulz" is a corruption of "lol," which stands for laugh out loud. Anonymous gets big "lulz" from pulling random pranks. For example, messing with online children's games like "habbo hotel." "Habbo hotel" was this online community where you had an avatar and you walked around and talked to other people. It was kind of like an early version of "world of warcraft" or "second life" or any of those virtual worlds. What the people on /b/ did was invade "habbo hotel," created thousands of avatars. They all had this one uniform of a black guy with a big afro wearing a black suit. And so there would be thousands of these people... black guys, black suit, huge afro... walking around this world, and they would do things like form a swastika out of themselves. And I think that was a real landmark because it was when they were able to see that they can use their numbers to do something really interesting and really disruptive. Those kids loved that pool. They loved the shit out of their pool. The goal was actually to offend everyone, simply because the idea that we could offend you by drawing a little shape on the screen was stupid to the people involved in it. They were like, "really?" You're gonna get that mad over us doing... just drawing this on the screen? Wow, well, you need to refocus a little on life, 'cause this should not be upsetting you that "much." Barrett brown, I'm the director of project pm and a former operative with anonymous. We were targeting furries, which meant we entered a subculture of people, of course, who a lot of people on 4chan find irritating by virtue of they're being irritating. A furry is someone, generally a male in his 20s, who identifies with animals and often times has sexual attraction to other people dressed as animals. We had furry infiltrators, people trying, you know... we had secret groups. Mine was called the "illuminati/I/illuminati," and our goal was to wreak as much havoc as possible, because it was stupid. There was a point when I otherwise seemed a respectable writer, in 2007, and my first book had come out like that, but I spent my evenings on "second life," that big virtual world riding around in a virtual spaceship with the words "faggory daggory do" written on it, wearing afros, and dropping virtual bombs on little villages and concerts, and waving giant penises around. And that was the most fun time I ever had in my life. All these different organizations online, whether it's 4chan or just any website, there's typically a community aspect to it. This is where people have their social relationships. This is where their friends are. This is where they have a creative outlet. And so all those aspects are going in to groups like anonymous where people feel like they're part of a bigger thing and they're able to express themselves within that group. There were certain words, certain phrases, certain ways people respond to things, certain images that are posted that created a pattern, and that pattern was, I guess, the origin of what is now anonymous. It's like free masons with a sense of humor, in so much that they have this common symbology and one of their chief joys, which is kind of wrapped up in power and secrecy, was the fact that they could recognize each other by referencing these symbols, referencing these phrases... "over 9,000." It's over 9,000! "I lost my iPod," "mudkipz," anything involving mudkipz. So you have this weird sort of international culture developing with people across the world, wherever they may be. In late '06, and into early '07, there's a bit of a sea change where instead of just posting a bunch of content, or randomly saying, "we're going to" go over to some website and post a bunch of dirty comments "against someone," it becomes a little more organized. Welcome to "the hal Turner show"! They went after a guy named hal Turner. I am being discriminated against because I'm white. Hal Turner was a Neo-Nazi who was big online and had a podcast. I think that the 14th amendment was not ratified properly, and I think, therefore, it is still okay to have negroes as slaves in America. I'm like, "yeah, screw that" racist son of a bitch! "Let's do this," you know? So I joined in, and I made some of the phone calls and I played around on the chat thing on his website and posted in the threads, and whatnot. Who are you? Where you calling from? Hola! This is Pedro! From San Diego! Spic, don't call my radio show anymore, you filthy spic animal! The college that I go to has begun an integration program where they try and purposely lower standards to bring more blacks and "diversify" the campus. And by the end of the next five years, they intend to bring over 9,000. He was just a horribly racist radio personality who seemed to handle it well when you called in. Like, he could handle being berated by anonymous. And that made it very interesting. It made it a bit of a challenge. It wasn't some guy who just either crumbled or stopped answering the phone. It was a guy who would yell back. I don't see really where you're going with this. Where I'm going is I believe Barack Obama is genetically incapable of exercising the power necessary to govern the most complicated nation on earth. That's where I'm going with this. And I think part of the reason he's incapable of doing it is because of racial-genetic inferiority. Is that clear enough for you? No, you changed the subject again. Wait a second, you asked me... Hal Turner wasn't the first actual person that anonymous had caused trouble for, but the circumstances ended up being significant. They ddos'd his website, stuff like that, costing him thousands of dollars in bandwidth fees. And then they ended up getting some real hackers to help them out, like this wasn't sort of pranks. They actually were able to get into hal Turner's private servers and his mail servers and find some interesting e-mails that he was serving as an FBI informant, which if you're a right-wing Neo-Nazi is not a good thing be. And obviously, him being an FBI informant, and also his reaction... his sort of douche-baggy reaction... to the raids damaged his credibility within the white nationalists scene, which is a shame. Hal Turner's gone. He's been prosecuted by the feds for threatening judges. It wasn't supposed to be different, but it ended up being different. People who observe anonymous see this group called anonymous is going after this white nationalist and say, "oh, hey", look, anonymous must be some "kind of activist organization." So, by virtue of those people joining anonymous, anonymous becomes more of an activist organization. What follows is a period of confusion and anger in which the original anonymous people... the sort who want to keep anonymous as this nihilist little ridiculous group... are upset that now the most terrible thing on the Internet is now becoming a force for good all of a sudden. Anonymous has never been about getting media attention or getting all of this attention towards it. I mean, it's a community, a pretty sometimes insular community that just kind of kept to itself, made jokes and made content. But that was, of course, changed completely. It's thrown completely on its head when chanology started. Anonymous began to become less just of a culture, you know, of people who wanted to perform pranks and more of the. Internet's first army. I'm Mike vitale, and my handle's "sethdood." Now, this is January 2008. Anonymous is strong now. You know, we're not a little dinky fucking group anymore. Like, this is, like, millions of people worldwide, and we're watching. And then scientology stepped in with a big target on its chest. A video came out of Tom Cruise. It was supposed to be, like, an internal scientology video talking about secrets of scientology. Being a scientologist, when you drive past an accident, it's not like anyone else. As you drive past, you know you have to do something about it because you know you're the only one that can really help. Talks about "you're the only" one who can stop, you know, bad "things from happening." And so, this is kind of wildly mocked online. It circulated like wildfire. There's nothing parting a wave for me. It's just "whoo!" These people found it humorous and goofy. And the church of scientology went into their legal mode, and they threatened websites with lawsuits if they didn't pull down the video. Instantly, the scientologists post a dmca... digital millennium copyright act. And this is a way that if you own content, you can go to video sites, upload sites and have your content pulled when someone uploads it illegally. Scientology's always at odds with the Internet, always trying to legally bully people out of fucking them over on the Internet. They always did that. And then here they are trying again, but you know what? Anonymous saw that, and they said, "oh, you guys just fucked" around badly. Like, you're trying to censor our Internet. You know, like, are you trying to take a joke away from anonymous? "Like, you don't do that." What these people did, in this case... gregg housh and these other people... was, they decided, you know, "we can" probably harness anonymous in this case and target "scientology." A few anons, a few people on 4chan posted "hey, we should" grab that video and post it on a "few other sites." And I was one of the people in that thread talking about it. We got the original source of the video by reaching out to the person behind the accounts and everything. We start posting it. The surprising thing was how fast they were dmcaing them on every site. It looked to us like they must have direct contact with the lawyers and the team who actually pulls videos at all of these sites. Like, it was... it was minutes and these things were falling down. We're like, "holy crap." That's messed up." What followed was... this is a term called the Barbra Streisand effect... and this video, as they're attempting to suppress it, went everywhere. Like, everywhere you look on the Internet, you were gonna stumble upon this video. Actually, gawker, the site that I work for, was, I think, the first one to put it on the website, and we got in a huge legal battle with scientology, who wanted us to take it down. A guy joins the channel, and he says, "you should all look at" gawker." So, we go over to gawker, and the strangest thing has happened. This big media company had the video up on their front page and basically had a comment underneath of it that stated very clearly that they were sick of this abuse that was going on. That made us think, "what have" we got ourself mixed up in "here?" Scientology is an interesting target, because in some ways, it's the perfect inversion of what geeks and hackers value. At so many different levels... Science fiction, intellectual property, discourses of freedom, science and technology. It's very proprietary. It's closed. And so, in some ways, if you had something like a cultural inversion machine and you stuck geeks and hackers in there, you'd get something that looks a lot like scientology. So it's quite offensive, and there's a real pleasure in attacking your perfect Nemesis. What really kind of dared us and set us off about scientology is specifically the treatment of their critics. Anybody who says anything bad about scientology is automatically some sort of criminal, some sort of crazy person, a drug addict. It's just that kind of mentality, that kind of... like, if anybody says anything bad about you, we're gonna fuck you over in the worst possible way. It's just... it resonated, like, this feeling of disgust within us. That was a big problem. That was the big problem, the censorship aspect of it, the audacity of this cult, this creepy cult, to go into our territory and tell us that we can't post this? No. Fuck them. No. It's not gonna happen. And people who knew what anonymous was to begin with were like, "oh, my god." Anonymous is gonna go to war with scientology? This should be really "interesting." Especially 'cause it's two weird-ass groups. I mean, you know, I've been an anon for a long fucking time. I know anonymous is really strange. Like, they're weird, and the stuff we like is weird, and it's really not mainstream at all. Now you have scientology... also really weird. A lot of crazy shit goes down. Anybody on the outside who's seen this is going, "let's watch" these two retards fight. Like, both their pants are gonna fall down. They're gonna trip, and it's gonna hurt everybody, and it's "gonna be hysterical." And what happened was all these people who were geared up, the infrastructure was built to war with other anons, said, "you" know what... fuck it. Everybody's gonna get together and pound the fuck out of "scientology." And then that's when 4chan kind of reared into action, really reared into action. And they started to troll the church of scientology. And this took the form of pranking the dianetics hotline, ordering pizzas. Every fax number we get, and we're sharing them all. You know, every number we get, we'd send black pieces of paper on a loop until it wastes all their ink. I go to call them on the phone, and it's busy, busy, busy. You know, and that's their main fucking dianetics hotline, their dianetics 800-number. You can't get through because anons have completely fucking clogged it and just probably saying stupid shit. The whole idea was just you call them just to keep them on the phone. "What's an elrond? How do I dianetics my face?" They were not expecting that, and they couldn't handle it. I'm Brian mettenbrink. I always liked anything technical, mechanical, anything sciencey, really. Computers do what you tell them to. They don't all of a sudden start doing weird stuff. And if they do, it's probably your fault, and I always like that, you know. They're perfect, really, in a way. I'd just gone to 4chan just on pure happenstance, and I saw a post about the scientology thing, and I started looking up stuff. And I'm like, "oh, this is" actually for a decent cause. I think I'll, you know, do "this." Anonymous members have developed a distributed denial-of-service attack tool called low-orbit ion Cannon, which is a name taken from a computer game. Low-orbit ion Cannon is what's called an endgame weapon in "red alert." All you had to do was literally follow instructions step by step. I downloaded a program that's free and legal for anyone to download and use. And I followed the instructions, and I typed in pushed "go." And what it does is it tells It tells them to send their website to my computer about, I think, it was 800,000 times in a weekend. And I'm pretty sure I probably took it down myself a couple of times. This tool is low-orbit ion Cannon, sometimes referred to as "loic." I am actually not breaking any laws by using this tool against my own computer, 127.0.0.1, which is a non-routable address. But, of course, if I were to have attacked one of those other bigger sites out there, I would have severely been breaking the law and would have been doing it in a way that was quite easy to track. What you do is, you put in the site. You see that the I.P. Is correct. You make sure that all these settings are good, and you hit the button. And off it goes. It felt like you were making a difference, you know, just you yourself and you didn't even have to leave your home, you know? You just sat at your computer and followed instructions and stood up for what you believe in, so to speak. You made your say in the world, and hopefully it turns out better for it. And like I said, we need to make a video. We have to make a video. Hello, leaders of scientology. We are anonymous. When the video came out on January 21st, that was one of the first times that anonymous as a culture started referring to itself as "anonymous," as a movement and declared that it was going to take down and destroy the church of scientology. That video probably changed everything. Knowledge is free. We are anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget. Expect us. It basically looked like if a computer was going to tell you that he was gonna beat the shit out of you, this is what it would look like. That one video, it really galvanized that moment, that moment of innovation that that's exactly... like, with that video, Internet activism, as it's known today, was born. What the video was saying was, "it's over." You're not going to be able to follow people back to their house anymore with impunity. You're not going to be able to just issue a cease-and-desist letter to any reporter who wants to write some shit about you that you don't like, you know. That's done with. Every time you do that, anonymous is gonna hit you "harder." So, we made a video named "call to arms." It said "we're going to the" streets. Every major city of the world "has a scientology building." Be very wary of the 10th of February. Anonymous invites you to join us in an act of solidarity. Anonymous invites you to take up the banner of free speech, of human rights, of family and freedom. Join us in protest outside of scientology centers worldwide. And you just see this consensus forming that it's going to happen. So we made the third video, the "code of conduct." "Don't bring weapons." Dress accordingly. Cover your faces 'cause they will try and find out who you "are and screw with your life." Rule number 17... cover your face. This will prevent your identification from videos taken by hostiles. Scientology has a history of harassing, stalking, and just doing horrible things to its critics. So people needed a way to hide their identities. A lot of people had very legitimate fears. They don't want to be followed home. They don't want to be stalked. They don't want to put their families and themselves in danger. Everyone was going, "well", we're gonna wear a mask. What's the only fucking mask that we already know or have a "joke about?" And it's the guy Fawkes mask. You see the movie "v for vendetta." You know, the ending scene where everyone's wearing the guy Fawkes mask, that is very reminiscent of what anonymous thinks anonymous is. We wanted to represent anonymity in some way when it moved into real life. I think that the guy Fawkes mask was one of the most natural things to happen. It is the idea that none of us are as cruel as all of us. You have this massive crowd of people who are anonymous that is going to fight against a bigger thing and win. Even after watching the videos, like, "yeah, this is" great, but who's actually gonna do it? Who's gonna step up? Are people actually gonna get "out of their house?" Like... and I guess we were really affected by the stereotype of that whole community, being Internet nerds. They're too afraid to leave their moms' basements. I figured maybe 15 nerds from every city somewhere might show up and wear their masks at a building for awhile and leave. No one thought that they were gonna come out. This is me on the way there. I haven't slept. I'm very fucking tired. And I remember going to the park that day, and it's really fucking early in the morning, which I thought was a bad idea. And I'm smoking a cigarette, and I'm looking around like, "where" the fuck is everybody? "Like, there's nobody here." So, here I am sitting in Bryant park. Waiting for the other anons to show up. I remember thinking like, "oh", fuck. Like, am I gonna be the only one in the park? Am I gonna walk to scientology with fucking six or seven people, which totally defeats the entire purpose of this because now they could single me "out?" You know, then I get up, and I start walking around, and I see there's a lot of green balloons over there for some reason. On the other side of the park, there was like fucking 200 people. There was guy Fawkes masks everywhere, and I'm like, "holy" shit, this is huge!" There's a fucking lot of us. That's pretty good. I had no idea how many anons there were until we started moving. Ha ha. And it just fucking got bigger. I remember walking through. Times Square, and everybody in. Times Square was an anon. Like, you know, this is, like, a fucking 1,000-person per, like, fucking minute foot-traffic area, and everywhere I'm looking, I'm seeing fucking anon symbols. It was fucking wild. It was really wild. [ Crowd chanting [ "don't drink the kool-aid" ] Whoo! Hell, yeah! So we start getting numbers in, and Sydney. We're thinking that it's going to be 50 people. And before 10:00 A.M., before even time, there's already 50 people there, and there are still streams of people walking down the streets. A couple hours into it, you know, 'cause I didn't go to bed until 1:00 in the morning, you know, you're looking at Sydney as, "wow, there's 250 people in" Sydney. The cops are estimating higher than that for their reports. What just happened? Adelaide, Perth, and Melbourne happened. And, you know, over 200 at each of them. We nearly broke 1,000 leaving Australia. Now, the next protest was. Tel Aviv, which had actually gotten its first scientology building right before this. There were Palestinians and Israelis at this protest both holding their flags. And at one point, they actually switched flags and held up each other's flags and whatnot. It was awesome to see. I call our guy in London, briternon, and I say, "hey", what's going on there?" And he's like, "did you just get" out of bed?" I said, "yeah, I haven't even" turned on the computer. "I just figured I'd call you." And he said, "we got 600 people" and the cops are really, really "mad at me." All the major cities were having hundreds of people come out. It was massive. Clearwater had like 300 people. I don't think anyone beat out. I.A. I think I.A. had over 1,000 people. The thing that happened was something completely different. Hundreds and hundreds of people from every city just swarmed the streets. It was kind of overwhelming, a little even scary, but scary in a good way. Soon, you know, we're at around the 10,000 Mark, you know, and we were joking the whole time "over 9,000," you know, one of those memes. It was too surreal. It was not believable. And you go by what name? We are anonymous. It was very empowering, especially after people saw the thousands of people showing up. This was it. We owned the world at that point. You've got lolcats and you've got rickrolling. You've got all these other things that anonymous has been involved in. Then, you know, take us a month later and, you know, 10,000 people were just in the streets and in every major country in the world in every major city in the world and what the hell just happened? What changed, you know? Who flipped the switch? The world looked very different to me at that point. We all met each other. The idea of an anon is you're fucking alone until you get to 4chan, you know, and then these people think like you, you know. Then all of a sudden, you're not alone. You are with fucking 500 others, you know. They all know the same jokes as you. They all have... clearly have similar interests as you. Here's your culture. You meet your own people finally. [ Crowd chanting [ "don't drink the kool-aid" ] Immediately, you felt like you were at home. If you were an anon, you were at home. We all, like, spent years in the same place, looking at the same pictures, laughing at the same jokes, and we pretty much were already friends even though we've never, every met. It was very happy. It's perhaps a little surprising. It's not just preteens or teenagers. There's a far more even mix of males and females than you would imagine otherwise. Everyone always figured anonymous was a very male, you know, thing, but it wasn't like that at all... at all. There's some fucking hot girls come through. Like, there's some really... Like, you'd be surprised. And, you know, there were a lot of... a lot of, you know, these so-called guys who weren't socially good. They were very awkward. They still lived at home at 23... half of them are virgins. And I'll tell you the amount of those people who got laid from these protests happening is in the thousands... that would not have, for years probably. And that's why those protests were so important. It was a chance to finally meet other people that were previously anonymous and unknown, and hence it was the moment of the end of their anonymity. Scientology... they kind of fought back, so to speak. They posted stuff online. While claiming they are peaceful, in less than three weeks, anonymous members made or encouraged 8,139 harassing or threatening phone calls, 3.6 million malicious e-mails, 141 million hits against church websites, 10 acts of vandalism, 22 bomb threats, and 8 death threats against members and officials of the church of scientology. They wanted to find me. They did. They hired p.I.S. They started taking pictures of us, threatening to sue us. People were getting followed. People were getting followed home. It'd be a regular thing for someone to say, "oh, I had to..." I had to lose someone on the subway. I saw someone from the scientology center, and they "were following me." They would follow us to our houses, try to intimidate us, send us cease-and-desist letters. These old tactics that they used to fight the activism they faced before the Internet were completely ineffective against chanology. You know, most of the people who received them actually framed them and put them on their wall. I've seen multiple of them framed and put on the wall. Mine's sitting in my closet somewhere in a box. I did the whole low-orbit ion Cannon stuff, and then I pretty much just went about my life after that for probably, let's see, I think it's six months. And then the FBI showed up here at my parents' house, where I wasn't, looking for me. Two men got out of the car, and took their jackets off, and laid their guns on the front seat, and came up to ask us if Brian was home, and explained that they were the FBI and they were looking for Brian. And I've never been so scared. And then my parents directed them to where I was living, and they showed up and said, "I'd" like to have a friendly "conversation with you." And I had the worst friendly conversation of my life. We sat down at my dining-room table, and they just started asking me questions. And I'm trying to figure out what they're here for 'cause I have no idea. And they eventually started asking me questions about anonymous. I was scared to death. I mean, my son is... Is looking at five years in jail and a $100,000 fine. You know, I had no idea that it was any sort of... this big of a crime to do what I did. I thought it was the kind of "slap on a wrist," $200-fine type crime. So, I actually told them that I did it at that point. Then it went from there. Yeah. As he explained it to me at the time, it was like pushing the refresh button over and over and over and over 800,000 times. And it seems like such a little thing. I did the second-most damage is what scientology said I did. I sent the second-most out of everybody so I got the maximum for my category, which was one year in prison and one year supervised release. I think... you know, the way I feel is, for what I did... was one of the most, like, lopsided punishments I've ever, like, read about or heard of. Yeah, I think it's ridiculous, especially the year supervised release where I can't touch a computer for a year. I'm not sure what that's supposed to solve, except make my, like, life difficult. So, that computer behind me, back there, I could go back to prison if I went over and touched it, because I can't knowingly associate with members of anonymous. They just made a big deal about scientology as a religion and that this is America and you can believe in whatever you want to believe. I'm pretty sure they actually compared me to, like, the kkk and the Nazis and stuff in the courtroom. Yeah, it's... it's a completely different issue. I'm very proud of what he did. He stood up for what he believed in, but that was never, ever mentioned. I never would even dream of hurting anybody, you know. It's just... Not me. Prior to anonymous, critics of the church still had to be very, very careful because of the aggressive lawsuits that were launched against academics, journalists, and other critics. I would say that era is over. And anonymous more than any other sort of intervention is probably responsible for that change. This actually caused a decent rift in anonymous. There was one big group... Significant group of people, who would say, "this chanology" stuff, it's cancer, it's awful, it's bad, it's... it's just bringing attention to us that we "don't want." The trolling isn't happening. We aren't getting our jollies. Like, now this is all really serious and moral and somber. And, like, "well, that's not" what I signed up for... that "kind of thing." And then there are the people who were on the other side, who were going, "well, I only signed" up for the serious and somber. You guys, go away. "This is... this is," you know. And, you know, there became this very fierce clash of ideologies, and it was alien to us. And they decided... in their own words, which I was privy to, 'cause it was told to me... "stop ruining our bad name." So, to make anonymous look bad, they go off and they post animated gifs... animated images... to epilepsy forums, that are black and white, just strobing really quickly, so any of the epilepsy people on these support forums see it and they fall off their chairs, you know, in seizure. You start hearing this term, "moralfag." If you're not out there making epileptics have seizures, then you're doing it wrong... So, you're a moralfag. Which is what I am... a moralfag, those who want to use anonymous as, you know, a tool for good in some sense rather than just doing what we used to do, which was to screw with video games. One anon said it well once. "There is no leader." Their ops have... Momentary "leaders, de facto leaders." Almost through meritocracy. There's more respected or more persistent participants. Some people participate in a single operation and are never heard from again. It might even be a housewife who just, you know, agrees with that political statement or that protest. If you had asked me all throughout 2008 and most of 2009, "is the politics of" anonymous always gonna be sutured and hinged to the church "of scientology?" I would have said yes. And it became unsutured, unhinged, when a different political wing was born in 2010. It's our task to find secret abusive plans and expose them where they can be opposed before they're implemented. The interesting thing about someone like assange is that he actually also sprang from, you know, a hacker culture. It's a mentality of spreading information. Julian was mendax. He was the greatest hacker that ever walked the face of the earth when I was a kid. I mean, they rumored he could move satellites around in space by hacking into NASA. I mean, you know, maybe it never happened but, I mean, you know, it was a myth that kept young kids like me wanting to, like, you know, plug a computer into a modem and see if I can move some satellites around. Wikileaks is an extension of the hackers ethos... truth wants to be free, and we want to liberate it. Wikileaks released a huge trove of diplomatic cables. There was a lot of controversy from every quarter of society. The wikileaks website released nearly 400,000 secret. U.S. files on the Iraq war late today. It was the largest leak of classified U.S. files in history. The diplomatic cables show the U.S. is spying on its allies. Lots of things which were understood in private and may have been not even talked about explicitly... suddenly they're out there in the cold light of day, and it's gonna make some governments and some individuals very uncomfortable. There was one particular moment that really sparked the fire, and this was when PayPal, mastercard, and Amazon pulled services for wikileaks. So, all of a sudden, there's no way to actually, like, process donations to wikileaks. And then people went and found, like, Neo-Nazi groups. Visa and mastercard were perfectly fine with you being able to, like, you know, PayPal, being able to, like, make donations to them. But wikileaks... no. Anonymous very quickly moved into an attack mode. Cyber protests, sit-ins... However you want to look at it... ddos is a tool that is a big giant... it's like driving a finish nail in with a sledgehammer. The numbers of participants were massive... massive. And they manage over the course of a couple of days to disable the websites of mastercard and PayPal. It was like watching the hack magician finally get a trick right, because you're not expecting it and then it's magnificent. It was beautiful. 'Cause what you had is people finding you stood up for something. How long has it been since we had a huge, really relevant protest. I'm not talking tea party, "I want to bring my guns in "public." I'm talking... I'm talking 10,000 angry people said, "this is not" right, and I want to do "something about it." Soon after, wikileaks was blocked in Tunisia. And anonymous got wind of that. They then intervened... at first, solely for the purposes of, like, stopping the kind of censorship that was happening. And they did some ddosing. And this was a time period where they were getting involved with what I would call "non-internety" social movements and building lines of solidarity. My name's Pete fein. You can call me an internaut or a hacktivist. Telecomix is an ad hoc cluster of volunteer net activists who have have spent much of last year trying to keep the Internet running in the middle east. During that time, we saw the Tunisian government not only censoring and filtering the Internet but also doing some kind of technical trickery to steal people's Facebook passwords and delete their posts and see who was posting what and, you know, fake posts... stuff like that. Some Tunisian hackers came to us. They were members of anonymous, and I didn't even know we had members of anonymous in Tunisia, so it was a shock to me. And they had some... they had the keys to some parts of the kingdom, so to speak, when it came to the dictator in Tunisia. We went in on behalf of those Tunisian anons, and we helped them get that and extract it, and then it went to wikileaks. The Tunisians overthrew Ben Ali, who was kind of a repressive dictator. A revolution that was facilitated by... by the Internet, by Facebook, and by Twitter. Not caused by it. I mean, 50 years of dictatorship has caused the arab spring, but the Internet has certainly been helping. The same group of hackers that target anti-wikileaks sites have now turned their attention to Egypt. In kind of the lead-up to the Egyptian revolution, we would tweet on people's behalf. We'd get people from Egypt who were unable to access Twitter on their own, on our r.C. Network, and we would take reports from them and tweet them out using... Using our account to kind of help them get the word out about what they were experiencing. Some of this shit is personal, and one of the things about the movement as a whole when Egypt rolled around is that Egypt broke us emotionally. Watching in real-time with live feeds that we helped set up, Egyptians getting massacred with machine guns. It was different, and I have never in cyber-activism wept before. It's never bothered me like that. It's never been able to touch me the way Egypt touched me. It was fucked up that we were watching people killed for no reason other than leaving their homes, that these people had every right to freedom, that they had every right to choose their government. And then January 27th, January 28th rolls around and the Egyptian government starts shutting down the Internet. I mean, just... for the whole country, for the whole country. There's this fantastic traffic graph that you can see the traffic coming out Egypt, and it looks like... you know, like this. Just totally stops. And we were just shocked. We were just like, "what the" fuck... like, what the fuck?" To think that a country would completely cut itself off as much as it was able to from the outside world was pretty unthinkable. You know, we know... we know bad things go on in the dark places. I put myself in their place, and I found myself in a desert of nothingness because he just wiped out everything that my world incorporated. That just showed me and everybody else that this same thing can happen at anytime, anywhere, in any government. Anonymous and the people on the Internet stood up and said, "go fuck yourself." You want to shut down their Internet... fine. The people on the Internet will show them how to turn it back on. In Egypt, the care package we put together included some kind of rcom information, the ham radio and dial modem details. In total, we helped coordinate and run about 500 dial-up modem lines. We also googled treatments for tear gas and other kind of basic medical treatment and found folks who could translate that into arabic... sort of put this together in a nice one-page pdf and fax, and off it goes. I think the most effective thing was shutting down government websites. We're taking your dictator's web pages down. President hosni mubarak has decided to step down from the office of president of the Republic. We had Egyptians come thank us as we're doing this stuff, and I said... I'm like, "look", you guys just get our back if "stuff goes down here." The FBI is now investigating anonymous... a loose collection of rogue, tech-savvy hackers credited with bringing down the websites of mastercard and visa last December. So, over 40 raids back then, they seize computers, cellphones, and those kinds of technical apparatus, sometimes including, in the case of the 19-year-old girl living with her family, they took her parents' stuff, too. There's always been a sort of cat-and-mouse dynamic, not just in relation to the feds but also to these sort of groups that have appointed themselves as guardians of the Republic. Suddenly on February 5th, a financial times article comes out that we all see. It's quoting this guy named Aaron barr, who's the c.E.O. Of hbgary federal, which is an intelligence contractor, and Aaron barr is telling this financial times journalist Joseph menn that he's been secretly monitoring the anonops server, where all this is going on, and has done so for several weeks, and using his own custom brand of information-operations techniques has managed to identify the alleged leadership of anonymous, including 25 "lieutenants" of some sort. We have to see this document. Everyone wants to know. We don't need to destroy him. We don't need to destroy his company. We just need to see the document, and we'll decided what comes next after looking at the document. So, they get it. It was unbelievably easy to get into that network. And my name was on there... As a screen name. And gregg housh was listed there by his screen name. The fact of the matter is what he told financial times was... Everything he told them was demonstratively untrue and very much hilariously so. He had to be shut up. It had to be proven to the world that this guy was a retard and that his information was in no way valid. And to put that in hacker terms, anonymous is a hornet's nest and barr said, "I'm gonna" stick my penis in that thing." In a mere 24 hours, he was owned, pwned completely by a small group of participants who basically went on a hacking rampage. Faster than you can say, "get" these hornets off my penis," anonymous took down barr's website, stole his e-mail, deleted the company's backup data, trashed his Twitter account, and remotely wiped his iPad. And he had just reached the "ham 'em high" level on "angry birds." The hbgary hack brought about 70,000 e-mails. Probably the most important ones had to do with a proposal that hbgary had already formulated. It was packaged up as a nice powerpoint presentation. Kind of act as privatized agent provocateurs where they were gonna discredit wikileaks. Hbgary was proposing submitting fake documents to wikileaks and then, when discovered as fake, the error could be called out and it would discredit wikileaks. So, there's a lot of, like, specifics I can't talk about, so let me try to answer that, though, in a general sense. Well, first of all, I'm... it's probably no surprise to anybody I'm not a big fan of wikileaks. I think that the broad purpose of trying to get as much information... proprietary or classified information for the government... expose that, is an extremely destructive and dangerous purpose. The proposals involved conducting information war on wikileaks and its supporters, creating dissension within wikileaks, ddos attacks. You also wanted to launch cyber attacks on wikileaks infrastructure to get information on document submitters. One thing, I guess, I want to make sure is clear is... None of those activities had actually occurred. You know, there's... in business, there's... You know, when you start proposing or thinking about an idea, there's a brainstorming phase. And somebody says, "well, what" if, you know... what could we do? "What's theoretically possible?" Well, still, this was an idea. This was proposed. This was something that you thought about. Right. They also wanted to go on a campaign kind of targeting Glenn greenwald, who's a reporter for salon, who's an outspoken kind of critic of the government and supporter of wikileaks. It seems like you're trying to attack a journalist here. Yeah, and I, you know... I don't want to talk too much more about Glenn greenwald, but other than, you know, what I previously said is, you know... There was never an intent to attack... journalists. Not on my part. You know... I guess I should say... I should generalize that and to say that, you know, I would never just outwardly attack a journalist other than if I felt that there was a journalist, in my mind, that was acting unethically. That's a fair game for having a public discussion about it. They were walking a very fine ethical line at points, and, in many cases, the mass opinion is, "no, they stepped well past it." I will not support broad theft of... of information released to the public 'cause that's nothing but destructive. If somebody has information that's been stolen from them, and whether or not wikileaks encouraged the theft of that or whether or not it was just put in their lap... still, they're... they're threatening to release the information that was the private property of another organization. So, your choices are to just allow that to happen or to try to stop it. How offensive is too offensive? You know, we've certainly seen a lot of strategy coming out of governments across the world now, saying, you know... Publicly admitting that they need to become... they need to develop better offensive strategies in cyber security, because defense as a whole isn't enough. It never is enough. In the court of public opinion that took hbgary quickly from being a perceived victim to being a perceived villain themselves. It was becoming harder and harder to distinguish the good guys from the bad guys. Hbgary changed anonymous... As tremendously as optunisia did. And within essentially a month of each other, these two events were totally formative for the collective. Optunisia was where it got its moral compass and its sense that it could affect the world. Hbgary is where it got its swagger. George hotz made it possible for PlayStation to run homebrewed software, which also lets you run pirated software. Yo! It's g.O. Hot. And for those that don't know, I'm getting sued by Sony. So, Sony went after him, claiming it was a dmca violation. They just kind of mass-lawyer nastygrammed him and shut him down and did sue him. He settled. And the response to that was immediate and brutal. Sony has confirmed that hackers broke into its PlayStation network, exposing the personal information of up to 77 million users worldwide. Over the next six to eight months, they were hacked over 20 times. There's no evidence that anonymous was anywhere near the majority of the hacks. One of the reasons why it captured so much of the media imagination when anonymous did it, as opposed to when other people did it, is because they were loud and bombastic, and they had a great image you could throw on the top of your article, and they made statements that, when you're constructing a story, you just can't resist. And then, kind of seemingly out of the blue, there was something by the name lulzsec that sailed into the seas. Lulzsec... it's a sort of a group, mostly from anonymous, who... large part of the same people who hacked hbgary. And they decided to form this little group and carry on operations outside the purview of anonymous for awhile. Lulzsec tried to say it wasn't anonymous for awhile. They tried to divide itself off. I don't think anyone bought it for a minute. There was no way that lulzsec was not anonymous, but the majority of time, the majority of anons were not doing anything particularly illegal. When they are, a huge number of them try to do that in a very specific political context. For those people, what lulzsec was doing... they were funny but they were attacking random targets. They were breaking the quasi-rules by attacking media. There was a lot of in-fighting about it because their way, you know, wasn't really our way. We will not attack the media. Pbs's "frontline" runs a documentary mainly focused on Bradley Manning, the alleged leaker to wikileaks, and a lot of Bradley Manning supporters didn't like it. They hacked the website, putting a story that 2pac and biggie had kind of escaped the world of celebrity, fame, and attention and retired quietly and discreetly in New Zealand. Lulzsec, when they attacked pbs, you know, that gave me the creeps, you know. As a journalist, I'm not too thrilled with the idea of someone judging that, "we don't" like you to write that. We don't like your reporting, so we're gonna shut down your "website." I'm uncomfortable with that. It could be me, and I could be writing something about a group that they didn't like. And I'm happy to sit and talk with them about it, but, you know, don't shut my website down. Hacktivism started to become... sort of... I would say almost more nasty, using, you know, sort of more no-holds-barred kind of attacks... sort of more vicious attacks. Lulzsec adds this dimension of bombastic lawbreaking to anonymous. For the people who are focused on things like the freedomops, who want anonymous to be a way of standing up to the powers that be, this is diluting and possibly counterproductive to their project in anonymous. You can try to make a case for civil disobedience and for, you might call it, crowd-sourced investigations using sometimes illegal means. It's hard to keep making that case, it's hard to maintain that case when you have these people from the movement... Fucking with people, you know, just fucking with people. They sort of saw themselves as going out there and breaking into, like, anything, everything... government, corporations, police departments... largely for the same reason that anonymous would. They went after Arizona for immigration policy. 50-day run causing mayhem, havoc... and then ended it. The computer hacking group lulzsecurity has announced it's disbanding, saying it had achieved its mission to disrupt government and corporate organizations for fun. I call this whole thing the rise of the chaotic actor. And chaotic could be chaotic good, neutral, or evil. And if you go back to the old "dungeons & dragons" charts... And some people see it on ops initially and will stick with anonymous as chaotic good. They saw operation payback or they saw attacking scientology, and they say, "that's good." It's like Robin hood, right?" Chaotic good... outside the system but doing something good. Other people saw anon as chaotic evil like the joker. They just want to see the world burn and are doing potentially irreparable damage. And the truth is, yes, it's the entire column of chaotic. I'm actually a little less concerned about some of the things lulzsec has done and more concerned about the next generation of lulzsec, the next turn of the crank of "who takes" it further or is more "aggressive?" Whoever fights monsters, you know, should see to it that they don't themselves become one. Sabu was probably the most famous anon who managed to kind of remain famous for awhile. Somebody who gets famous in anon generally gets punished very harshly by anonymous. But sabu managed to avoid that a few ways. I mean, he was a controversial figure... incredibly controversial figure... inside of anonymous. He was bombastic. He was thuggish. But he was also very good at mentoring and encouraging people and giving them permission to try things. And that was, I think, one of the most pivotal things about sabu's role. And it also speaks to the absolutely soul-crushing level of betrayal... When it was revealed that sabu was working for the FBI. There are still people who cannot let go of the idea that he was somehow on their side, that somehow he had to have been working against the FBI to help them... no matter how much is revealed. But he had betrayed the collective. It devastated everyone that he had touched. Hugh Davies. I'm an independent barrister. Amongst the cases I'm working on at the moment are the lulzsec base prosecution. I can't comment on sabu, but with cyber criminals, whatever their motivation, it may not be personal profit, but it is a very strong, sometimes destructive motive simply for those with whom they disagree. In criminal terms, it's vandalism. One has to be extremely careful that one person's exercise of freedom of speech is not at the expense of some other quite legitimate organization's equal right to have a lawful website operating, available to the public in a Democratic society. And simply taking out lawful websites 'cause you disagree with them is an erosion of freedom of speech rather than extending it. Really, as powerful as they seem to be, lulzsec and anonymous are really small potatoes compared to the bigger operations that are going on that we don't hear about, maybe operations funded by governments. The criminal hackers... this is not some lone idiot, you know, hunkered down like beavis or butt-head, cackling at midnight over his computer. There are a few of those but it's organized. There are ad hoc contract workers. It comes out of Russia, comes out of Romania, comes out of Iran... comes out of wherever. But they work on behalf of the usual criminal enterprises the computer-security industry has just been growing and growing and growing over the last, you know, 10, 15 years. There's $10 billion companies in the computer-security industry. I don't know what the total market cap is, but it's certainly in the billions of dollars. Black hat, when I first started coming, like 15 years ago, there was, like, 500 people. And there's 8,500 people today. So, every year, more and more people come to learn about what are the attacks. Companies come to, you know, sell new products. And the government is coming, saying, "we want to recruit" you to come be our new cyber "warriors." The kind of thing that drives people to something like anonymous is that sense that their government is going to watch them every moment of the day and, in America, our government is kind of watching us all the time. Like, we now know that with the warrantless wiretapping. You know, we live under constant cctvs. We have that sense that not only are we being tracked, but it's about to get a lot worse. The NSA has embraced domestic spying. They're building a giant spy center in Utah. And the only thing... the only thing... that even gives them pause is encryption. Anonymous gives people a way to exist outside of this system. There's a certain online culture that believes in certain values like freedom of expression. They're against corruption. They're against governments controlling their citizens. And when they see those values harmed in some way by some organization, the hacktivists strike back. 16 people were arrested today. Dozens of FBI agents targeted alleged members of a loose-knit hacking group. Armed with search warrants, agents hit six homes in. New York, along with locations across the country. The people arrested yesterday were suspected of attacking. PayPal's website after the company shut off payments to wikileaks. Defenders of the hackers say they're merely engaged in civil protest, but FBI officials worry the disruptive cyber attacks could move in a more dangerous direction. So, the FBI shows up. It's 6:00 in the morning, and it was really obnoxious. And I remember being frustrated and angry because there was nothing that I had done that would have justified an FBI search warrant. They came and... Guns blazing and all this other good stuff... Busted down the door. I immediately just dropped down on the floor, 180. I wasn't trying to fight nobody. The theory of the case is they were, you know... they flooded... "a number of people" flooded access to PayPal, thereby creating economic distress to a protected "corporation." End of story. This isn't... this is not a case involving identity theft, involving outing e-mails, involving violating privilege, involving theft of services, involving, you know, shutting down business. It is a pure case of Internet or cyber sit-ins. I think when barrack Obama gets on television and says, "flood" the switchboard, shut down the Republicans, send the "message"... that's legal. And even if you accept what the theory of this prosecution is, it's no different. This is an electronic sit-in at its finest. So, what I'm facing is a felony... 15 years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine. If you're a pedophile, the average is 11 years. That's ridiculous. I mean, you can go molest children and get less of a sentence than you would for breaking into someone's phone. If you... even if you accept what the government is saying is true, what is important is that people are participating in the process. It is very much the process. It is sitting in at a counter in Selma, Alabama, 500 freedom riders refusing to allow people to go sit in at a segregated lunch counter. They write books about that stuff. It is demonstrating at a street corner saying no to a war. It's just a different... it's just a different vehicle. It's the same result. You know, I would never compare myself to people like Gandhi or. Dr. Martin Luther King, but they were one person, and they were willing to go out and change the world. And their messages live on every day through everybody. And to not take the chance of having something like that to do is foolish. I only wish we had 50 million Mercedes haefer. I'd feel a lot more comfortable as a guy getting towards the tail end of his career if there were more Mercedes. There's always gonna be legal consequence when you decide to break the law. That comes with the territory. And it would be naive not to expect that. The question is whether the punishment will be proportional to the crime. And I suspect it might not be. People will be watching very closely to see how these cases proceed on what grounds and whether there's any room during the trials to think especially of the denial-of-service attacks as a legitimate form of protest. So much of our lives are now configured at least in part on the Internet, so we better start thinking about how we claim parts of the Internet as spaces that we can also protest. This is the point in history at which you decide whether or not protesting is possible online. You can stand up, and you can say freedom of speech extends to online. We have the right to not be monitored by our government because of our opinions. It's up to you. You're in the position of huck Finn. Do you remember huck Finn at the end of the book? He's told he's got to take that slave and give it back. Two things will happen if he doesn't. One... legally, he'll go to jail, as Jim is property. Two... he'll be damned eternally and burn in hellfire 'cause he's in an Evangelical environment in Missouri. And huck smokes his corncob pipe all night, thinks about it. And next morning, he says, "well, damn it, I'll go to hell, then." In other words, he discovered that in order to be an expert at ethics, you had to transcend the legal and sanctioned religious appropriate truths of the day in order to access the meta truth of both legality and righteousness. Well, hackers see themselves as huck putting down that corncob pipe and saying, "all right", I'll go to jail. All right, I'll go to hell. But I'm gonna do the right "thing." I suppose the question you really want to ask is, would I do it again? And honestly, after thinking about it, I felt that I did what was right. I had a belief... I still do... That what I did was the right thing. And hopefully someone got some good out of it. You know, I'd love to think that maybe I stopped someone from joining a cult, you know. Probably wouldn't tell on myself next time, but, you know, I don't think I would have changed a single thing other than the whole "talking to the FBI" thing. Just that little detail. Yeah, just the little detail that kind of changed everything. Yeah. I'm angry. Occasionally, I have small breakdown moments of terror. But I haven't stopped believing what I believe. I haven't stopped wanting to fight. I haven't stopped caring. Show me what democracy looks like! All: This is what democracy looks like! Show me what democracy looks like! We got sold out! I don't think this whole issue is a technical hacking thing. This is more about human philosophy and psychology, what's motivating us, why is there so much unrest or disenfranchisement or anger that would lead people to want to take matters into their own hands and join them. Whether you think it's bad or not is irrelevant. It's not going away. I have stood upon the mountaintop known as anonymous and looked down on a world enflamed with revolution. What can you say? Your spine tingles when you're at the cusp of history. When you're surfing, you know, the waves of history, your spine tingles. Descent has a face now. It has an aesthetic. There's this package it can pick up and put on anywhere in the world for any cause it wants. And sometimes that's gonna be terrible, and sometimes it's going to be wonderful. One thing I can kind of promise is that it's gonna be interesting. It's rare in history that new things happen, but I think this is one of them. If you have power in real life and you have money in real life, you know, it doesn't fucking matter on the Internet. What matters on the Internet is your actual ideas, you know, how smart you are, the quality of you. And when certain organizations that, you know... they want to extend their real-life power onto the Internet, it's not gonna fucking take because of anonymous. I don't care if you're a democrat or a republican or an independent or if you like Ron Paul or if you worship pigeons or scientology or if you're catholic or atheist or methodist. I don't care about that. Your opinion matters. I don't care if I disagree with it. I don't care if I hate your guts. Your opinion matters. Is there going to be any further action? I mean, does anonymous intend to prove that they can, in fact, manipulate the westboro baptist church network of websites? What can we expect going forward, anonymous? Actually, I'm working on that right now. He's working on that right now! Oh, yay. So, hold on. I am getting a thumbs up from my producer that there has been a message posted that appears to be from anonymous on downloads. Anonymous, are you taking responsibility for this? Yep. We just did it right now this very second. That is so special. That's so special.
