what brings you here at this hour, Captain? I started thinking and couldn't sleep. If anything should happen to the transport, the Pacific will become the ocean of death. with the one ton of plutonium on that ship, you could make more than one hundred Nagasaki-type A-bombs. No need to take the trouble of making bombs. Inhaling only one millionth of a gram is sufficient to cause cancer. Japan's only a little further. Let's hope nothing... This is Patrol Boat Nojima. Emergency! The Kairyu-Maru has run aground! Run aground? It's more than 3,000 meters deep here! But we have... We have run aground on something. Here! Any radiation leak? we're investigating. what the heII... Stop the engines! Those available, check the leaks and bulkheads. But unless ordered otherwise, you are prohibited from entering the cargo area! Bring the light here! Hope it's not somebody's submarine. It's an atoll. It's gigantic! You're moving? Didn't you stop the engines? well... The atoll seems to have moved away on its own. Captain! It's right beneath us now. Such an atoII is impossible. GAMERA THE GUARDIAN OF THE UNIVERSE The Kairyu-Maru has run aground east of the Philippines Deep. Longitude, East 1 30 degrees 5 minutes, latitude North 4 degrees 30 minutes. The vessel suffered only minor leakage, and there's no threat of foundering. A special rescue squad is being dispatched immediately by air via... Do you believe in a civilization sunk under the sea? You mean like Atlantis or the Continent of Mu? Right, with science more advanced than ours. Maybe it's related to the drifting atoll in the Pacific. What do you mean, an atoll? It seems to be approaching Japan. I understand the general picture. We should be thankfuI that there was no radiation Ieakage. But what if the plutonium had polluted the ocean? My responsibility is immense. The joint investigation by Yashima Marine Insurance... Please let me be a part of it. Marine Agency personnel intervening in the private sector? I'm aware of the ruIes. But being left out of the initial investigation is frustrating. That's why I want to find out what that really was. Nagamine! TeIephone! Coming! Hello? was it Professor Hirata? Did he hang up? He seemed to be in a hurry. Did he say anything? No, but there was a lot of commotion in the background. I hope he's not going to ask me to go to the island. Hurry up! Hurry, start the engine! A bird! A bird! - Excuse me. - Yes? Mr. Kusanagi's house is near here, isn't it? Does Mr. Kusanagi drink? He drinks pure rice sake, bourbon, and rum. He's not fond of Scotch. This is Mr. Kusanagi's daughter. I'm Asagi. Sorry to be a bother. welcome home. Mr. Yonemori has offered to cook for us. Isn't it great? Is it ready to eat? Wait a minute, before you... I got bored with my vacation, and so I took the liberty of helping with the housework. If a non-paying job is okay, l've got one for you. In the Pacific? - Yes, starting tomorrow. - Great! - Will it be long? - I really don't know. We're going to look for that drifting atoll. Aren't you worried, with a girl staying home alone? I trust you. You're a big girl. I don't think that's the point. From around Christmas IsIand to the GiIbert lsIes, off the coast of the Caroline lslands, to the east of the Philippines Deep... If you Iine up the witnesses and encounters in chronological order, it looks like this. I'm sure the atoll must be drifting on the Black Current from the north of the Equator Stream. From the point it was Iast encountered, and the speed of the Black Current, you can calculate the approximate location. It should be in this area. what do the Nagasaki Police want with me? We went to Professor Hirata's research lab at Kyushu University, and they mentioned you. Is it about Himegami Island? We've had reports of a rare big, young bird seen there. Yes, that's why Professor Hirata and his team went there, but we can't contact them. Did anything happen there? well, now, we don't really know. A sailor disappeared. The last message he radioed in was "bird". Bird? Hey, is anybody here? Hey! If you're here, answer me. Hey, is anybody here? What the heck happened here? How many people were on this island? Six families... seventeen peopIe. And they aII disappeared because of some bird? It's hard to beIieve, but... It's impossible. The only life form which could do such a thing is man. What about a new species? what is it? Looks like pellets. You mean a turd? A lump of undigested objects. But they're so big. It's Professor Hirata's. Sonar response. Please confirm starboard. Sonar response. Confirm starboard. Dr. Nagamine, let's come back tomorrow. It'll be dark soon. Maybe it's nocturnal. All the more reason to leave now. we're not fully equipped. What if it attacked us in the dark? I'd like at least a gIimpse. If that's the suspect, it's beyond our jurisdiction. we have to foIIow it. What the hell are you thinking? It's left to find food. And if we move, that food will be us! If that crosses the sea, the casualties will be immense. A bird? Is it reaIIy a bird? It's not just a bird! Its wing span is 1 5 meters. And it attacks people! I don't believe it. lf it's that big, the JASDF Kasuga base radar must have detected it, and be on alert. The JASDF? Oh, the Self-Defense Forces. we're not going to make it! Anyway, please alert all the necessary parties. Can you catch up? wouldn't that be dangerous? The ones in danger are the islanders. Here we go. Please! Draw its attention to us, away from the island. Hey, it's not that simple! You're not the pilot, are you? Hey! It's the Self-Defense Forces. Look! At that island. I knew there would be more than one. A village on Himegami lsland of the Goto Archipelago is beIieved to have been attacked by birds. The birds seem to be hiding on Himegami Island at present. The Self-Defenses Force are now monitoring the birds' activity. As for their behavior, ornithologist Dr. Nagamine, discoverer of the bird, comments as foIIows: was the investigation team eaten by the birds? Did the birds attack Himegami Island? They're not birds. They have fangs, and no feathers. There is no such bird. Step back! 60 meters long and 45 meters wide. How can such a gigantic thing be drifting like a weed? The radiation count? Extremely low. It won't be hazardous to us. Be careful. Did you find one, too? what are they? They're all over this atoll. As if deliberateIy Iaid out to be found. Hey, look at this! what is it? Let's dig it out. I'm begging you. I only agreed to go to the island. The same for me! Anyway, I'm going home. We really need you to come with us! I haven't even changed! We'll find clothes for you to change into! Professor Hirata's death is a shock to me. Please understand! I'm sorry that we disregarded your feelings. we're just trying to save lives. I'm sorry! Who do you want me to see? Commissioner Saito of the Environmental Agency. Let's dispense with the formalities. The Cabinet has decided on capturing those life forms. Not only is it academically important, but it may also be meaningful for the protection of rare species. we want you to devise a plan to capture them. You mean me? You're very young, but you're the only specialist who has actually seen them. Their sphere of action is wide, and they're highly lethal. They've already kiIIed people. By the decision of the Cabinet, we will undertake this operation. It's too dangerous. what? We don't know anything about their behavior patterns yet. Capturing them on assumptions is too much of a risk. Dr. Nagamine, the Cabinet has made its decision. Yes, there. Maybe this whole atoll is like an ancient burial mound. We've chartered a helicopter to haul it up. It's heading this way. Roger. what is it? It's at body temperature. I hear something. Like a ringing in the ear. What happened? When they take off, pop them with the anesthetic gun. That should do it. If they fall into the sea, they'II be drowned. This anesthetic paralyzes the muscles. Not enough won't work. Too much will stop their respiration and kill them. That sure is tricky. If only there was a place to trap them. Such a place... Of course not, right? There is! This is it. This is it! Harry Hawk, this is Hercules 1 . we are above Himegami lsland. we'll be on standby. HercuIes 1 , this is Harry Hawk. Roger. Since those life forms flew accurately to Onoko Island, like migrating birds, they may fly by reading the Earth's magnetism. Eventually, Fukuoka is where they'll fly to for more food. If we cannot guide them, the casualties will be great. They tend to shun light, so it will probably work. Probably? That's not good enough. Excuse me, sir. You are the ones demanding the capture under these most improbable circumstances. I will, however, do my best. Thank you, ma'am. Harry Hawk, this is Hercules 1 . They have taken off. Can all three of them be guided? That's why I asked for three helicopters. Move two of the units to make a formation. Yes, sir. There's a civilian chopper in the restricted zone. The press choppers aren't supposed to enter that zone. A gigantic life form? Yes, and it's heading straight here. How big is it? More than 60 meters. Our hands are full with 1 5-meter flying life forms! Formation completed. They are flying smoothly to the Dome. This is Hercules 1 . Estimated time of arrival is 20:20. I'll go down to the field. She's really something, a fine lady indeed. Report from the patrol plane. Unidentified object advancing 1 2 kilometers offshore. An object? Not a boat? Speed, approximately 50 knots. It's heading straight towards the Dome. That's it! Take your posts. Three CCs of Succinylcholine per injection. Is the amount correct? Paralysis will begin in a few seconds. - Lights on. - Lights on. Take aim. Guidance complete. Please close it. Roger. Switch power. Close the ceiling! Yes, sir! Try to get all three at once. The ceiling still isn't... Fire! One is getting away. Stand down. will you attack? Military action is strictly limited to defense purposes. Even then, we are not allowed to attack unless the enemy opens fire. Call the Secretary of Defense! Yes, sir! we interrupt this program for a speciaI buIIetin. At Fukuoka Port a short while ago, a monster... a monster has appeared. The Self-Defense Forces have been dispatched to the site. we repeat. A monster has appeared at Fukuoka Port. The Self-Defense Forces have been dispatched. The monster seems to be heading towards Fukuoka Dome. At the Dome, the operation to capture the birds found at Himegami Island is now underway. The monster's relationship with the birds hasn't been verified. The operation at the Dome may be greatly affected by the appearance of this monster. With the monster landing at Hakata Bay, inhabitants living in the West, Central, Sawara, and Hakata wards are ordered to evacuate. Retreat! All units retreat! Orders to evacuate have been issued. Please evacuate at once. But... Closer. Get closer. It's dangerous. Please stand back. Is that the thing you were telling... what's going on at the Dome? why won't it leave the Dome? Because of the birds. How did they... Capturing the birds has failed, owing to the appearance of the monster. I am now on the field where the operation took place. It's a disaster area. The cages have been destroyed. How can they be cut so cleanly? I was about to ask the same question. The monster is assumed to be hiding in the Seto Inland Sea. Warnings have been issued to all vessels in the area. A bill allowing the Self-Defense Forces to attack the monster has been submitted to the House of Representatives, and will be debated with utmost priority. when the biII is ratified, the first military action in Japan will take place. will it come to Tokyo? It'll be cool. No way, it's scary! Don't you think this red snapper is too expensive? Because of the monster, I hear no fish come in from the Seto Inland Sea. what luck for my husband's birthday to come at such a time. Ryuji, we're leaving. Ryuji, I said we're leaving. Ryuji, knock it off already. Having guests? Yes. Can't you listen? I'm listening. The engravings resemble those of the ancient Pyrenees. Please continue. This professor says the engravings may belong to the same family as rune characters, originating around Etruria. Did rune characters really exist? You know of them? They're in fantasy novels. So have they been deciphered? It wasn't too difficuIt because there were characters to compare with. "The Iast hope, Gamera. we bestow it in the cradle of time." "May it awaken with the shadow of evil, Gyaos." what is it? I don't know. A prophecy, perhaps? By the way, that metal... This? I aImost forgot. A souvenir for you, Asagi. wow, thanks! Hey, that belongs to the company. Just one, okay? I found this one. There are dozens more of them. Is it okay? There's no equivalent among the metals known to us. Is it an unknown substance? The comma-shaped bead may be related to the ancient civilizations of Japan. If the Orichalcum mentioned in Plato's writings existed, this could be it. - Ori... - Orichalcum... The metal used in Atlantis. Hang on. What's Atlantis? The continent which is said to have sunk into the Atlantic 1 2,000 years ago. But this was found in the Pacific. The legend of a sunken continent could have spread around the world in various versions. One of them could be Atlantis. You mean the monster was created by man? We can't be sure, but how do you explain a life form which flies, spinning like a flying saucer? what's its energy source? Plutonium, that's what. 1 2,000 years ago. . . The cradle of time. . . Gamera... It's warm. If the giant turtle is Gamera, the birds must be Gyaos. Nagamine? She's gone. Gone? where did she go? To Himegami Island. They found something again. Were they attacked by something? No sign of any parent bringing food. They must have devoured each other! Gamera and Gyaos. A world of fantasy, absolutely beyond me. But they need names. But the sea monster... Gamera is a bigger menace to us. It'll bring on greater disaster. Even if the monster came to destroy the birds, why is it hiding in the Seto InIand Sea? How do you explain that? It just awoke from a long sleep. It could be charging its energy. It could be related to the abnormally low level of electricity in that area. well, peopIe tend to connect everything with the monster. What happened to the birds? Carbon isotopes of eggshells and bodies of the young birds found on Himegami Island show they were formed 1 0,000 years ago. More experiments are underway. But they possess unnatural characteristics as life forms. All of them are females. How do they reproduce? Or. . . Do you mean they don't reproduce? The two that escaped are the only ones left. They may be more of a rarity than the Japanese ibis! The ibis doesn't eat people. Target spotted. - Target spotted! - Rapidly surfacing. Hey, I heard they found the monster. No kidding? It was on the TV in the audio visual room. At the Kii Peninsula. will they attack it? Of course they will. All those people got killed. I want to join the SDF and fight the monster! Let's go see it! Asagi? I have to go. Bye. Wait, Asagi. Where are you going? Yes. Yes. Roger. Out. Message from the Air Defense Forces. The squadron on patrol has lost the target. where did it fly to? It's no use. Can't you get a hold of Dr. Nagamine? The whole team is out of reach. Why didn't they inform us about the birds? She's the bird speciaIist. we're the atoll investigation team. At present, the only factor bridging us is that metal plate. She should have had time to call. She chose the birds over you. If Gyaos really is here, I hope she's safe. Hear that? It's close. The monster? The bird, the bird! Going back is suicide. My boy's back there! My boy's back there! HeIp me, please. ls it only the boy? The investigation team from Tokyo is... Masao! Another one. Masao! Thank you! Thank you. If you hadn't come... No. l wasn't the one who saved you. Mr. Kusanagi, Gamera is on our side. The monster reappeared in the Harima Sea, and is now heading towards the Tokai districts. For safety purposes, the train will stop at Mishima Station. The train will stop at Mishima Station. To ensure safety, the Tomei and Chuo Speedways will be closed. The Tokaido bullet trains will make emergency stops at the nearest stations. The government has announced that the sea monster will be referred to as Gamera, and the bird-type life form as Gyaos from now on. Gamera, which made a surprise attack at the Fukuoka Dome on June 1 0th, and hid in the Seto Inland Sea, has reappeared in the Harima Sea, and is flying toward the Tokai districts. The first missile attack in Japan is now approaching. The target, decreed as endangering the peace by both Houses, is the giant monster Gamera. A short while ago, the SDF's type 81 guided surface-to-air missiles were launched, and made impact with Gamera, flying over Suruga Bay. After receiving direct missile hits, Gamera seems to have fallen near the foot of Mt. Fuji. Both the Air and Ground Self-Defense Forces pursued Gamera and have surrounded it. A generaI attack will soon be made. By this attack with overpowering firearms, the Self-Defense Forces hope to completely immobilize Gamera. Due to this attack, all roads in the Mt. Fuji area will be closed. Passenger aircraft flying over the area will also be restricted. Is Mt. Fuji far from here? Far or not, right now, the monster's... Please go as far as you can. No way. Go to a movie theater if you're a monster freak. I have to go, no matter what. Please! All normal, sir. Commence first attack! All companies, open fire. I've always wanted to do that. Gyaos approaching from above. Hold fire. All companies, hold your fire. Run. Run! Run. Gamera is getting away. Commence second attack! All companies, open fire. Hey, are you all right? Hey, what's the matter? Hey! Asagi. where's Gamera? It escaped to the sea. That's good. Gyaos seems to have landed in the woods of Mt. Fuji. I hope it won't be too late. Too late? we must hurry. But right now, Gamera and l have to rest. The decision to capture Gyaos is still valid. It's impossible. It's stronger and twice as big as the time at the Dome. It's growing at an amazing rate. Wasn't Gyaos beneficial in fighting off Gamera? You should fight off Gyaos, not Gamera. The prophecy on the metal plate? A more realistic scenario would be highly appreciated. Then for Gyaos, take the same precautions as you do for Gamera. Gyaos attacks people. we're fully aware of that. We are taking precautions by installing flood lights in densely populated areas. I'm sorry for the victims and their families, but suppose a Tyrannosaurus appeared. Even though it would attack people, no doubt everyone would want it captured. Yes? It's for you. It wasn't easy getting hold of you. Sorry. You guys were fast. For my senior, how could l refuse? And the specimen was special. Everybody worked hard. So what do you think, Michiya? It made us think about our work. What does it mean to rearrange genes? These are Gyaos' chromosomes. Only one pair? Impossible. Chromosome pairs. . . Humans have what? 23 pairs. Chickens have 39 pairs. Green frogs have 1 2 pairs. To have only one pair is unusual. Genetic information is developed through evolution. There will always be waste. These chromosomes include tons of functions of other life forms, but no waste. They are a perfect pair. Is such a life form possible? Gyaos is not the result of evolution, but a perfected form from its origin. Are you saying somebody made it? It's beyond conventional technology. There were Y-type chromosomes, as well as the X-type. Isn't the Y factor for maIes? The autopsy results said both Gyaos were females. If a female transforms into a male, one Gyaos can reproduce by itself. If it begins to reproduce, it'll be disastrous. They'll feed on humans and increase at an amazing rate. The shadow of evil, Gyaos. A passage from the plate. It's dangerous to attack Gamera and protect Gyaos. I know, but what can I do? - what about Asagi? - Asagi? You can't be serious. with that metaI, she might be able to communicate with Gamera. If communicate sounds funny, because she came in possession of that metal, she's been given the role of a priestess. when we touch the comma-shaped bead, nothing happens. The incident at Mt. Fuji may have been a coincidence. There's nothing physically wrong with her, but she's still asleep. This civilization must have been destroyed by Gyaos. The people were destroyed by their own creation? When Gyaos went beyond their control, maybe they hurriedly created Gamera. The last hope, Gamera. But it was too late. So they left Gamera for future civilizations. Then what made Gyaos rise from its sleep now? why in Japan? Gyaos' genetic information is taken from various life forms. when the ancient civilization disappeared, there was no food. So it laid eggs and waited patiently for the eggs to hatch in the right environment. Does that mean that the environment in Japan now is suitable for Gyaos? Carbondioxide, rising levels of nitric acid compounds, increases in ultraviolet radiation... with such drastic changes in our environment, anything is possible. The ultra-ancient civilization left us a terrible heritage. We too are trying to leave a terrible heritage. Such as plutonium. I believe the half-life is... For plutonium 239, it's 24,000 years. It'll remain on Earth for hundreds of thousands of years. we're the ones creating such things. Perhaps we're destroying our own civilization. wait a minute. They were destroyed, but we're still alive. Corrupt it may be, but I don't want it destroyed. we won't let that happen. The life form has been confirmed as Gyaos. At present, it is flying from Shinjuku to Ginza. It is estimated to have grown to a wingspan of 1 00 meters. Use the floodlights to prevent it from landing. The Cabinet canceled its decision to capture and voted to attack Gyaos. So we will... Since Gyaos is nocturnal, we should attack during the day. A surprise attack of sorts. will it be effective? I can't say for sure. You must not underestimate the adaptive power of that abnormal life form. It's beyond any conventional organism. Evacuation of areas A and B completed. Roger. Continue monitoring. Type 81 surface to air missiles, installation complete. Even if it escapes to the sky, the type 81 can pursue it. I see shield plates on its eyes. Shield plates? Fire. Fire! Impact in 5...4...3... Target turning south towards Shimbashi. Second flight of guided missiles in pursuit. Shoot it down in Shiba Park. It's noticed the missiIes. The Tokyo Tower... The sun is no longer on our side. Gamera has really become our last hope. Gamera... Where could it be now? You're disgusting! with peopIe Ieaving Tokyo to escape Gyaos, all means of transportation are as crowded as the holiday season. The Tokaido bullet trains leaving Tokyo Station are reported to have 1 80% boarding rates. Special trains have been prepared by JR to respond to the evacuation. The Tomei Speedway is backed up for 1 00 kilometers. Traffic is also jammed on the Tohoku Speedway for 1 00 kilometers. Haneda International Airport is currently closed. The sounds of airplanes landing and taking off may affect Gyaos. We have not been informed as to when the airport may resume its operations. With the closing of the Kabutocho Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen. People have turned to selling at other stock exchanges, which are in a panic. Despite the intervention of the Bank of Japan, the yen is rapidly falling. From sunset to dawn, refrain from going out. wide streets are especially vulnerable to attacks by Gyaos. Following Gyaos' movement, traffic in and around Minato Ward is restricted. Inhabitants of Tokyo must refrain from going out. Just one Gyaos has turned Tokyo into such a sight. I hear it'll take a week to evacuate everybody from Tokyo. Even if Tokyo is emptied, Gyaos will just move on to another densely populated city. We now bring you news on Gyaos. The government has decided on a full-scale attack on Gyaos at 7:00 a.m. This operation is designed to destroy Gyaos with the simultaneous use of heavy artillery. Minato ward is predicted to become a battleground. Inhabitants of this ward must evacuate. All main roads will be closed. All JR and private trains will be stopped. Inhabitants in a ten kilometer radius of Tokyo Tower must evacuate. If you are still remaining, follow our announcements for prompt evacuation. I guess your dad doesn't know you as well as he should. Asagi. Asagi! Asagi. Some day, I'll show you around a monster-free Tokyo. Thanks. Mr. Kusanagi... Are you okay now? Maybe you were right. She says Gamera is coming. He's here. Gamera and Gyaos are moving towards Akihabara. Gamera and Gyaos are moving towards Akihabara! Gamera and Gyaos are coming back towards Roppongi. Asagi! It's extremely dangerous. Close enough to see them! Please try! Gamera is again ascending. Gyaos is in pursuit. Gamera and Gyaos both ascending rapidly. we can't track them. Asagi, that's enough. Stop! Stop it already! why must you do this? Because of the bead? Because Gamera is fighting for all of us. That's why! There! Dad. . . It won! Thanks, Dad. Gamera is leaving. It's going back to the sea. Are you all right? But I can't read Gamera's mind anymore. After the ultra-ancient civilization was destroyed, if Gyaos planned to return... Yes, Gyaos eggs could be anywhere on Earth. what did you say? lt's just a possibility, but it's worth it to be prepared. we may not be able to count on Gamera next time. He will come. Gamera will come again. THE END
