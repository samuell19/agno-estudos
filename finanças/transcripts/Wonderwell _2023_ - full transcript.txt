- I have a secret. Don't think what I'm doing is easy. My sister, 15, trying so hard to look perfect. She can't see she's already beautiful. My mom, she used to smile all the time. Where did that go? And my dad on his computer. He always says it's work, but so many times, it's really not. I'm casting a spell to bake us back together again, happy and sweet. - You ready to go? - Almost. - Now we cannot be late, okay? - Okay. My family can't even see me. - We have to leave, like, right now. - But my cookies aren't done yet. - She just wants to ruin it for me. - Come on, Violet, hurry up. - Oh, yeah, my secret. Sometimes I think I'm a witch. As for that spell, I said it wasn't easy. And now, I've ruined everything. - Watch what you wish for. - It's not making sense. - Should I pull over? - No, no, no, keep going. - Said one lemming to another. - Huh. - Quit it. - Violet. - Oh, go, go right at this traffic circle. - Wait, wh-which right? There are, like, five choices. Hello? Any clues? - I give up. - Typical. - What is that supposed to mean? - A'right, give me the phone, I'll do it. - Can you? Why did she have to come? - Found it. Thank God for me. Uh, miss, uh, miss... I guess that's her, right? - Yeah. - Everything is ready for you. - Oh, Adam! - Yana, how are you? - Good. - Good to see you. - Savannah. - Hi. - Hi. - And this is Chloe, Savannah's mom. - Hi. So nice to finally meet you. You must be a model too. - I was, of course, but now Yana is all about business. And Yana's business today is to find a face for her line. So let's go, people! Let's move! - Stop. - Not much to get excited about. - I don't know. This one's pretty special. - Oh my God, Violet. Outside. Now. - Ciao. - Ciao. - I don't know what that means. - The auction place where they sell the cows. - There's no cows here. - No? - That's mean. - Feel the light, feel the beautiful light. - Que bello. I, I'm Daniele. - Violet. - You not one of them? - No, are you? - Eww, no. - So why are you here? - Boss lady, she's my matrigna. - Daniele, what are you doing? Where is my package? Get inside now. - Stepmother. I, I, I have to go. - See you, darling. - What? - Why Savannah? - Trust me, she'll bring me the key to Paradiso. - She's not the face of your collection. I know what look I need, and I know... - Brava, Savannah. Congratulations. - Uh. - This is Franco. - Oh, hi, I'm, uh, I'm Adam. This is my wife, Chloe. - Thank you, it's all so unexpected. - Savannah has to look like she's just... - It's about time. - And who is this little angel? - Oh, the naughty daughter, Violet. - Violet. - She could be a model like her sister. - Look at this contract, would you? - Sure. Oh, uh, it's, uh, it's in Italian. - Oh, well, that shouldn't be a problem for you, right? - Uh, no. Thank you. Come on, you see what Savannah was wearing today? I mean, a little slutty. - That's what kids wear now. - For the last time, no! - How come it's fine for her but not for me? - Your sister thinks this is a big opportunity. I disagree, but she's old enough to start making decisions like that. You on the other hand aren't quite there yet. - It's not fair. - When you're 15, if you still want creeps like Franco to use your body to sell sleazy clothes, then- - I am not letting Franco use my body. - That's what photographers do. - Hey! - I know, I know what photographers do. That's why I'm taking time off work tomorrow to make sure he doesn't. - Oh, right. - What? - Yeah, that's why you're going. - It is. - I'm not blind. - Listen, honey, we, we don't ever wanna stop you living the life you wanna live, but everything has a season. - What's the big deal? What are you so scared of? - There's things out there. - Out where? - Dangerous things in, in, in the world. Your, your mother and I just want you to, to, to stay safe. - You mean like creepy men saying, "Get in my car, little girl. I'll give you some candy"? - Yes, yes, but not just stuff like that. - Then what? - Look, it, it's, it's like a plug, a really big one. - Giant plug? - Yes, with a chain on it. - What if I open it? - No, no, no, don't do that. Well, the, the whole world will get sucked down or bad things could come up. - Like what? What bad things? - Just don't open it, yet, okay? Come here. Love you, mm. Now, get outta here. - You could destroy us, you understand? Now look at me. Feel your power! A little more to your left, that's it. Now, okay, okay. You are a spider. - Eww. - No, no, you, you're not really a spider, but you're like a spider. And you eat your boyfriends for lunch. Okay, listen, it's a metaphor, darling. Do you know what a metaphor is? That's it, that's great. That's great, perfect. Hold that! Okay, show me how you devour your prey. Show me, I wanna see it. I wanna see it in your face. That's good. - You know what I mean? - One foot forward. Now lean towards me. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, you want a gelato? - No, thanks. This is boring. - Oh, if I have to be here, you have to be here. - Can I go for a walk? - Why don't you just stay here? - But I wanna see the town. - Don't go outside the walls, okay? Promise. Promise, Violet. - Fine, okay. I promise. - That's good, you are, uh, that's incredible. - Okay, alright. - Yes. - That's it, alright. - Ciao. - Ciao, what are you doing? - I'm running away. - To where? - Out there. - There? There is only forest. - Sounds good to me. - No, it is not good. A witch sleeps there, a real one. - Yeah, right. - My farm was there. I know. - I'd rather take my chances. - Daniele! You're holding all of us up. - Be careful. - Kill me, kill me with your eyes. That's it. Now, give him more anger. More anger, I wanna see more anger. That's it. No, that's too much anger. Too much anger. Yeah, that's it. - Where's Violet? - She went for a walk. - Look at me. - You let her go on her own? - Your daughter's all by herself in this scary old village with no big strong man to protect her. - Yeah, well, you never know what's out there. - Not so sweet. - She'll be fine. - Put, put, put one leg over this. - Daniele! Daniele! Daniele. - What do you want? - Get off the scooter. - No, my father give it. - Look. - For me. - Calm down, I have an idea, okay? - I said no. - Yana. - Daniele, do what he says. - Okay. - Get off the scooter! Savannah. - Mother. You gave me this gift. The flowers that love me. Is love the key? Speak to me. Why me? Will you teach me? I will listen to you. I promise. - Oh, that's good. Now, move the hair out of your eye. Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it. A little more. Okay, head back more. Put your, put your left hand on the back of the seat there. Nice, nice. - I won't stay here long. - Well, do you want me to get off? - What do you want? - Ah, nice. You read my mind. - Hey, Savannah! Hold, Savannah! - Savannah! - Daniele! - Hello. - Hi, are you the witch? - The witch or a witch? - A boy told me a witch lives here. - Oh, my name's Hazel, what's yours? - Violet. - Well, Violet, if you believe everything that boys tell you, you're gonna have a very rough life. Oh, meet Delilah. Wanna see my garden? - Okay. Wow. - Ahh, ahh, ah, no, no. Naked Ladies, very dangerous. - Dangerous? - Poison. - And that one? - Oh, Angel's Trumpet, extremely deadly. - Is everything here poisonous? - Not everything. - I know these. They won't hurt me. - Really? Well, it depends on how you treat them. - Wow, nice. - You can have one if you can reach it. Oh, come on, she's too young. Well, look who's up. - What happened? - That apple was too high. - No, the ladder was too short. - Oh. You hungry? - I guess. Are these poisonous too? - You're interested in flowers? - Flowers are interested in me. - Oh, so you know what flowers are for then? - They aren't for anything. They're just flowers. - They're actually sexual organs. - Eww. - There's nothing eww about it. It's just true. Well, except for those. What you think are their flowers are actually their stomachs. - Plants don't have stomachs. - They're carnivorous. They like their meat fresh and alive. So all alone in the forest. Now, what's that about? - Well, everybody else was so busy with my sister. - And you wish they'd be busy with you? - No one even sees me. It's like I'm not even there. - Mm, so you want them to see you like they see your sister? - Not, not exactly. But why not? Seems like fun. - Oh, power is always fun. It's just not always safe. - You sound like my dad. He said, "It was like a giant plug." - It? - You know, sex. He can't talk about it without getting embarrassed. - You wanna see it for yourself? - Um, how far are we gonna go? - Well, it's just through there. - What is? - Well, go and see. Go on, you'll be fine. - No way. Open it, open it. - Who said that? A friend, a friend. - How do I know you're my friend? - I'm only trying to help. Peek underneath. You'll laugh when you see. - When I see what? - What you've been looking for. Go on, pull! Harder! - Whoa. - Hello. - Who are you? - I'm not you, I'm me. - If you're not me, then who are you? - If I asked you the same question, I'd get the same answer too. - So where are you? - Here, you're looking right up at me. - But I'm looking down. - No, I'm looking down. Can you find a rock? - What for? - Can you? - Like this? - Yeah, perfect. Now throw it up to me. - But you're down. - I told you, I'm up, you're down. Now, come on, there's not much time. - Time for what? Do you wanna find out what it's like or not? - Find out what what's like? - Just throw the stupid rock. Awesome. - I don't feel any different. - You will, here, catch. Better now? - What happened? - We switched. - What? Okay. That was pretty cool, but let's switch back, please. - Not now, tomorrow morning at sunrise. But if you're late, you'll be stuck up there. And I'll be stuck down here forever. - What? Wait. - Sunrise, promise? - Okay, okay, fine, I promise. - Don't forget to put the plug back to make it all work, goodbye. - Wait. No! Stop! Please don't! Stop! No! No! I changed my mind! - Welcome. Welcome. - Please don't eat me. - Eat you? You mean as if you were a cookie? - I'm not a cookie. - You smell like one. Shall I try just a little bite? Play time's over. Quick, off you go before I change my mind. Good luck. - Well, what took you so long? - There's a huge creature thing who wants to, who wants to eat me. - No, no, no. It just ate a bunch of naughty boys last week. It can't possibly have an appetite yet. - You tricked me. - Did I? - Where am I? - On the other side. - Of what? Looks the same. - Does it? - No, yes. But. Oh my God. Do I still have parents on this side? - Of course, and a sister, don't forget. And everyone else. But you seem to have lost your flower. - Well, yeah, that water's really cold. - Well, let's find you something warm to wear. I thought you were gonna hurry. - I am. - Oh, look at you. You look gorgeous. You are gonna make a beautiful young woman. Well, you already are. Ooh, try one of these. They are delicious. - Mm, oh my God. - Right, you know those people that you were so keen to hang out with, they would never let you near food like this. - That's messed up. - You know what's really messed up? You not knowing how incredibly pretty you are. So I want you to try some of this drink. - No, thank you. - Come on, nothing terrible's gonna happen. - I'm too young. - Not on this side, you're not. On this side, you know better. - So if I do something on this side, does that change things on the other side too? - No more than any action you take today could change the events of yesterday. Unless, you've got to make it to the plug before sunrise tomorrow morning because if you don't, you're gonna be stuck on this side with all the choices you've made forever. So, drink up. - I wanna go back now. Not 'til tomorrow morning. - I mean, to the town. - Oh. Well, well, off you go then. But you gotta be careful, you know, those woods are very dangerous. You, you can always just stay here with me, right? Look, if you don't like the fizz, try some of this lemonade my grandmother made. The secret is in the cinnamon... Oh, well, choose the right path. - Boo, you still smell like a cookie, and I'm feeling rather peckish. - Fancy meeting you here. - We need to talk. - Neutral ground? Go on, you'll be fine. Follow the red ribbon. - You know the rules. - And you know how I feel about rules. - Paradiso is yours, Inferno is mine. - Usually, but my girl isn't usual, is she? - She's not yours. - Really? Are you sure? - Her sister's as good as mine. Her parents too. She can't hold out against all of them, poor girl. It's only a matter of time. - And this key. - Yes, our mother's key. It must now pass to me. - It's not a trinket, Sister. It's what makes the flowers bloom. You burned yours. There's nothing left in you to bloom. And yes, the key must pass, but to a child of flowers, whom you've brought to me. Would you even recognize our mother if you saw her? I wonder. - You, you, you would never pass it on to that little brat. - I'd sooner give it to her than let you get your grubby little mitts all over it. - She wouldn't know what to do with it. - And you would? - Oh, name your price. - You could never pay it. It has to be given freely, remember? - Fine, give it to her. Go ahead, see what happens. - It will be fun. - Pardon. Hey. - Ciao, bella. - Huh. - Savannah! Is it you? - Of course it's me. - Ah, I've been looking for you everywhere. - Wherever I go, whatever I do, you just have to tag along. - Do not! Do you have any idea where we are? - Ahh, duh, the hotel's just around the corner. Oh, and Mom's worried about you. - No. No, I mean, this place. This other side, this! - What are you talking about? And where'd you get that dress? - An old lady gave it to me. - Yeah, right. Did she give you that padded bra too? - Ah, I just saw something awful! - So awful it made you grow boobs? Hey, what'd you see? - Dad, with his arm around Yana. - That's all? - That's all? What if he's in love with her? - Don't be stupid, Violet. - I'm not stupid. It's just everything in this world is so wrong. This isn't our real life. - Did that old lady get you drunk? - No! But there's a way back. I jumped through it. - That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. - Just listen to me. We can go back. The both of us together. - Why? I'm having fun here. - You don't understand anything. - But can you just quit being so crazy? And don't you dare tell Mom. - Girls. - Hey, Mom. - Hey, Mom. - You rode away in the middle of your job, without permission, on a motorcycle. - It was a scooter. - And you! I almost had the police out looking for you. I should just ground you both for life. - Mom, nothing even happened. - That is not the point! Where'd you get that outfit? - Some old lady gave it to her. - What? Are you wearing a- - Leave me alone. - Oh, forget it. Let's just start getting ready for dinner. We shouldn't be late. - Wow. My girls look beautiful tonight. Violet, that is a great dress. What happened? You, you look kinda, oh. - Violet, sweetie, where's your flower? - Uh. - You know, we got some great stuff today. You both should take a look. - Oh, these are beautiful. - Wow. Thank you. - Whoa. What? When were these taken? - These were awful. - Dad. - Those were taken today, you were there. - I, I certainly wasn't. - Yeah, you were, I could see you. You were reading your book. - I must've been on the phone. - Oh, no, no, no, no. You were telling me a riveting story, something about, uh, your job. - Hmm, but Savannah is beautiful. Yes? - Hello? The correct answer is yes. - Where's Daniele? - Ugh, probably hiding from us. Knowing that boy. - He hates working for you. - Violet, mind your own business. Why would anyone hide from you? - This one, Violeta. She has something so rare. So unique. Of course, it all comes from you. - Mom, I don't feel very well, can I go back? - Great idea, get some rest for the party. - I don't wanna come to your party. - But I can still go, right? - These, uh, these girls broke a lot of rules today. So they need to go to bed and think about that, hmm. Alright, go ahead, honey. - Mom. - Well, I mean, everybody's gonna be there. Magazine editors, model scouts, designers from London, Paris, Milan, New York. Of course, Savannah will be guest of honor. - That's, that's very kind, but umm... Well, we've decided that- - Oh, come on, Dad, please! - No. No, it's too much. - This is so unfair. - Savannah, end of discussion. - What are you doing? You can't go to the party, Dad said so. - Shut up. Dad is not gonna know unless you tell. - Why do you even wanna go? - Because I'm the guest of honor, Violet. - They're just saying that. - Next time you see me, I'm gonna be on the cover of Vogue. - Who cares? Everybody there will be horrible. - Maybe you're right. Franco's kind of a creep. He looks at me like ugh. I mean while Dad is drooling all over Yana, and he can't see she's just playing him. - Says the girl that's being played by Yana. - The only nice one's Daniele. - He's too young for you. - It was so cool, holding him tight on the back of his bike. I could smell him. - Eww. - Yeah, it wasn't exactly like a nice smell, but it was good. - Did you guys kiss? - What? We were in the middle of town. There are people, like, everywhere. - So you didn't kiss? - Not yet. - Savannah. - Ciao. - Ciao. - I can't believe this. How could you let this happen? Those pictures of Savannah. You basically signed your own daughter up to make pornography. - No, no, I signed my daughter up to be a model. Where were you? You were supposed to keep an eye on that creep Franco, but somehow that never happened. - What does that mean? - You know exactly what that means. - Is your sister with you? - No. - Oh. - Are you here to take me to the party? - Don't go. They're bad people. - It's fine, I'll find it on my own. Oh, and don't bother waiting for Violet. She's already asleep. - Oh. Oh, so it's my fault. I guess Yana's my fault too. - All right, can we please just go back to our room? - Why would I wanna go back to the room? You don't wanna be with me! You wanna be with Yana! - Alright, listen to me. - Don't touch me! - All right, you need to sleep it off! This conversation is over! - Yeah, this marriage is over! - Fine by me! Violet. - Yana, Yana thinks that she decides everything. But , Franco has the eye. Franco chooses who Yana sees. And Franco chooses how she sees her. Okay, with... Without Franco, Yana sees nothing. And don't forget, be nice to Franco. - Savannah! - What are you doing here? - Coming with you. - No, you're not. - Please come back. - Leave me alone. - Are you meeting Daniele? - That's all you really care about, isn't it? - Are you? - God, just quit following me. - I'll follow if I want to. He thinks you're a stupid cow. - Who? Who thinks I'm a stupid cow? - Daniele, he told me. - Daniele never said that. - Did too, yesterday. - Did not! Did not! - First thing when he saw you at the audition. - You know, just because you suddenly grew a pair of junior boobs does not mean you know anything. Daniele likes me, and we're gonna kiss. - Fine! Go ahead! He's a jerk who only wants to make out with you so he can brag about it! - Ugh! - Ciao. - Ciao. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - Did you go to the woods? - You were right about the witch, hmm. - What happened? - Nothing. - Are you sure? - You're looking for her, right? - Who, Savannah? No. - So, what are you doing here? - I'm waiting, and I'll wait some more. - What for? - To be grown up. What do you wait for? - Sunrise. - You're lucky, tomorrow you go home. Never have to see Franco or Yana again. - I'd like to see you again. - I would like to see you too. For you. For when you go away. - Wow! She's a lying little hypocrite. But she was right about you. - That's not what I meant. - Five minutes ago, she told me that you were nothing but a little jerk trying to make out with girls so you could brag about it. Your exact words. - I hate you. - I hate you too. - Violet! Violet. - Chloe! Ah, I thought it was you. It's nice to see you. What's wrong? - Mom? - Oh, oh no, Violet! Wait! Wait, stop! Violet! - Don't mess with Franco! If you do it again, I will kill you. - No! Bastardo! - Jerry, ah. - Ciao. Franco knew you would never stay away. And we're gonna find you something fantastic to wear. - Oh, but- - You'll love it. - Uh. - You're early. - Go on! Do it! - Do what? - Bite my head off, I don't care. - Why? Because your parents turned out to be merely human? - They could be humans without being so selfish. - Oh, so you're giving up? - No, I'm going back, where everything else isn't so crap. - Huh? I thought you were braver than that. - Brave? Nobody on this side is brave. Everybody here is weak, and mean, and selfish. And I don't wanna see them anymore, any of them. - What if they were all the same on both sides? What if it was you who wasn't seeing them before? - No, that's not how it is. I'm going back, and I'm going now. - It's too soon. - Hey, where's my bike, huh? - I washed it in the river. - No. No! - Yes, sucker. - Now, now, boys. Let's play nice. Guest of honor's here. - Savannah, what have they done to you? - Look how beautiful we made you. - No, she was beautiful before. Now, she's just like all the others. - Violet! Violet, please. Where are you? - Uh. - Savannah, we want you to join us. Become a member of our family. Do you accept? - Yes. - You know what to do. Now let's show ourselves to the world. - Go on. - Ladies and gentlemen, I want to welcome all of you extraordinary people. You are the first to experience the Paradiso collection. And now, I give you the incomparable Yana. - I love beauty. Beautiful bodies, beautiful clothes, and beautiful lives. So may I present to you my beautiful birds of paradise and my new collection? - Violeta. Violeta! Violeta! Violeta. - Daniele, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. Are you okay? What happened? - I'm fine. - Come on, I take you to the hotel. - No, wait, there's this door in the forest. I gotta get to it before sun comes up. - Maybe you hit your head on a rock. - No, I didn't. Just trust me. Just, please. Just trust me. Just trust me. - Okay. - Wait, wait, what happened? Have you seen Savannah? - Yes, I did. She's one of them now. - No, mm, she isn't. We have to save her. - Don't you worry. We're family. - Yeah. - Where is Savannah? Where is Savannah? - They took her to a room. - Where? - Time to decide, Savannah. Are you ready? Ready to take your career to the next level? - She's ready. I can tell. - Savannah? Savannah? - Violeta. - What are you doing with my sister? - Waiting for you, darling. You took your time, but I'm happy that you're finally here. - Yes, but this, this dress, I mean, Mamma mia. We'll get her something much better, I promise. Not you. - Savannah? Are you okay? - What are you doing? It's too late. She's one of us. - Come on, we're gonna have so much fun, I promise. What do you say, Violeta? - But hey, you're always welcome to join. - Savannah, I'm taking you home now. It's okay. It's okay. - They're both coming with me. - No, they're not. Now clear out! - I love you. - Oh God. - Love you. - Okay, let's get out of here. - What? Savannah? - What are you? What? What the hell did you do? - I'm clear. - Franco, forget the camera. - I'll kill you! Look what he did! - Stop! - Now you're dead! - Franco! Oh God. Come on. - Savannah! - Hey! - Savannah. - Daniele! Daniele, Daniele. - Violet, where are you guys? - Daniele. - Please, this is crazy. Why is she so special? - She has my key. - Your what? - Let's go, move! - Whoa! What is that? - Don't just stand there! Stab it! Kill it! - Are, are you kidding? - No, do it. Now. - Shoo! Go away! - Ooh, I'm so scared. I'm shaking. - Look, final warning. - Careful, I'll kill you with my eyes. - You know what? I'm done. This is your problem. Not mine! - Franco. Franco, get back here now! I hate you. - I know. You fear the me in you. Which is why you can never have the key. Paradiso is mine to give, remember? - To that little brat? I'll just destroy her. And then you'll fade to dust. And my Inferno will live forever. - Live forever? You're already dead. And you just can't see it! - No! You're the one that's dead! - Would you even recognize me? I wonder. - No, no. - You've got to make it to the plug before sunrise tomorrow morning. - No, no, no, no. Oh, great. - I've got you now. - What do you want? - You, darling. It's always been you. - Never. - Fine. New offer. I let you go if you give me that. - What? This? Fine, take it if you leave me, Savannah, and Daniele alone forever. - Deal. I promise. You silly, silly little girl. You've just given me the key, which means... Why? You. - Want to try again? - It's not a toy, you stupid, stupid little girl. No, it's mine! What? What are you... Mother! You're supposed to, stop! Ah, no! - Hazel! Hello? Hazel! Hazel. - I knew you'd do well. - Hazel. Thank you. I didn't make it. I'm stuck on the side forever. - Well, that's one way of looking at it. You reached it after all. Life can be just as magical with this garden. Only it's a lot more fun. - Violeta! Violeta! - Daniele! Ciao. - Ciao. So you decide to stay? - Mm-hmm. Where's Savannah? - Let's go. - Savannah? Savannah! - Violet!
