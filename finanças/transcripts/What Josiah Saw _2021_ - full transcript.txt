But uh, I was up early on account of my leg and uh, went ahead on downstairs and out the window, just as the sun broke on the horizon, I see, I see this little man. And by little, I mean no bigger than a half a foot or so. And he's wearing this green suit and he's got these funny shoes that curled up at the tips. And then this little man, he just up and start dancing. He's dancing in place. A jig, a jig is what you'd call it. He's just jigging away, faster and faster and then he just up and stops. Then what happened? Well, he squats down all low. He drops his drawers. His face squench up. And then it happened. Pa, what happened? He shat out a rainbow out his little ass. He shat it out all bright and beautiful, pulled up his drawers and run off. Ain't that something? You know, listen Pa, you know that ain't happen. Leprechauns don't exist. Yeah well, you think God exists and you're ignorant enough to believe that. I suppose ignorant was a poor choosing of my words. It's a bad judgment, that's all. You come with me tomorrow. Would you like that? You can drive. Ah. We've resurfaced most of the main roads, even put in that new filling station. I'm sure you've seen that. Biggest one I ever saw. Biggest one he ever saw. Well, you being an assemblyman here in town and all, we're gonna be perfectly candid here. Now, your town is all but dead. Now the only thing keeping it together is our company's interests. See, it all goes hand in hand with our plans to harvest oil from the shale. Let's just cut to the chase here, Mr. Gentry. Any help we can get in acquiring those outlying properties, Well, we'd see that as a real asset. We're prepared to offer generous commissions. Well. This is Willow Road, that's the Graham property. That'll be a tough sell. Most have a price. We have drafted some offer letters for all the parties involved. I'm sure you will find that the offers for compensation are much more than market value. That place has a bad history. Is that right? Mm-hm. Anybody left around here can tell you about it. Something awful come about. - Cat's left that bag, Mr. - Gentry. Well, sometime back, we're talking decades now, the wife, her name was Miriam, people around here called her Mim. Real big in the church. Always made sure her twins and the youngest boy, Tommy, were present and dressed proper. Real saint of a woman. God tested being married to a man like Josiah Graham. This particular Sunday, Mim was nowhere to be found. Wasn't like her. Tommy, he was especially close to his mother, he kept looking at the church door, trying to catch some sight of her. Never seen a boy so lost. He run out mid sermon. Figured he'd gone to fetch her. Found her hanging from that old oak tree, swinging dead from the neck. Left to right. People say that, that property, I mean town folk. They swear it's haunted. The ghost walks that farm at night. Some say it's her. Oh it's just town folk talk, really. That's some story. Seeing as how you guys need a friendly face to help in acquiring that Graham property, figure any commissions gonna have to be very generous. You got money, boy? I got that $10 that Mary sent. 10 whole dollars? Well I can't figure if that makes you or Mary rich, then. It's for my birthday. For your birthday. Eli, he didn't, he didn't send nothing. If Eli had anything to send, he'd probably whore it or gamble it away. First step that boy took was a mud pile of trouble. Get that outta your head, boy. Tanner's my friend. You ain't got no friends. Don't you see him no more. You know what that woman say? Mrs. Tate. She say I should keep that retard of mine locked up in the basement. She say she gonna sick that dog of theirs loose on you, you ever try to see that boy again. She think you the village idiot. Good for nothing simp. That's what she think, all right. She can see anything she want. Witch of a woman. Hmm. Pst. Tanner. Tanner, Tanner. Come on, we gotta go. You wanna get the magazine? Come here, boy! Hey! I got the leprechaun jiggy going!

She say that we gotta right our ways, and she gonna send somebody to guide us. But they gonna come to me, and me only. And she say, if we right our ways, and we right a great wrong, that we could save her. We can save your mother, boy. She say she love you. She say she loves you the best. Lord, we are grateful for a whole mess of things. We're especially grateful for the chance to right our wrongs. We, please get this strength to Eli and Mary and we'll pray for them, too. Lord forgive us, amen. Amen. Mama. Mom, is that you? Pa, did you, did you see her? I did. She weren't alone. Whatever she was with, it spoke without saying a word. Oh yeah?

Temptation's the work of the devil, but resolve, that's God's hand. This bringing you back. Bringing you back to when Eli, he took you out there in the shed and, he showed you what's what. That was long time ago, Pa. Yeah, well that's 'cause you show resolve. Yeah, ain't nothing wrong with looking at whores, no sir. You look at whores all you want. As long as you got resolve.

God damn. Nine year old girl went missing last week. Little ways outside of Austin. Well this ain't a little ways outside Austin. It's close enough. You're on my list. You know anything about a nine year old girl gone missing? The only thing I know is you're gonna make me late for work. Life ain't hard enough for you? Words out that you're gambling again and you're in deep. Drinking, whoring. How many violations you think I need to put you back inside? The answer is none. I get one crooked hair up my ass and you are done. You know, I got some Prep H inside the trailer, you can help yourself. You're funny. Don't worry about being late for work. I had a talk with your boss, man. He was all sorts of unaware about you being a nonce. That's what I called it. He didn't know what it was. So I explained to him, that's what they call child fuckers in prison. That girl was 16, she's boozing up in a bar. She told me otherwise. You wouldn't know it by looking at her. All that, that was five years ago. I did my time for that. Come on, you know that. Only thing I know is a crossed line is awfully hard to step back over. You best go toss it. Oh yes, sir, I'll do that. You move an inch off your throne, I'll shoot you dead. Nonce. Hey. Here to see Boone. Logan ain't seeing you, Eli. I don't need Logan, I want to talk to Boone. Well, you know this. You want to see Boone, you gotta go through Logan. Let me check. Hey Logan, Eli's here to see Boone. Tell him to fuck himself, Billy? He says go fuck yourself, Eli. Hey, I got, I got money. He says, he's got money. Yeah, he always says he's got money. Tell him to fuck himself, Billy. He seems resound, Eli. Know what man, I'm fucking, fuck you. I'm not doing this shit. Hey, you fucking dope. Shit. Put it away. You boys done blowing each other? Eli wants to see you. No shit. Come on then, hey, come on. God damn it, man. Can't make a bloody Mary to save your life. You're the only one that drinks them. Have a seat, Eli. I apologize Sheriff, where were we? Oh, he's no bother. Eli, I'm gonna give the Sheriff here an envelope full of money. There's a little bit extra in there, Sheriff, on account of your anniversary. Sheriff's been married 40 years. God bless. Sheriff, always a pleasure. Eli, is it? You owe me money, of the substantial variety. Four hundred and eighty dollars? You're in for a mess more than that. Forgot, you know, I got something else. That ain't even been cut yet. That's worth two grand, at least. You just toss smack on my desk? Did you just toss smack on my desk? Do I have to ask the fucking question again? All right. I'm gonna have you killed, Eli. Dead and buried. And there won't be a soul in the world who'll give a shit. I'll work it off. I'll work off the debt. I'll tend bar. I'll even clean the shitters, you know, I'll do... You want me to put you on the payroll? Well you might as well start by hitting me in the dick with a hammer. 'Cause that'd be about as appealing to me. I'll get it. I'll get you the money. Forgetting immediate unpleasantries committed, you getting me my money is the general nature of the conversation we're about to have. You ever hear of Romani. Gypsies. From Germany, Romania, wherever, over there. Most come after the second World War. Jews got the bum wrap, sure, but Hitler's boys, they killed communists and radicals. Gimps, retards and queers. Generally anyone they disagreed with, or couldn't trust. Gypsies being part of that congregation. You know why Nazis pulled Jew teeth? 'Cause Jew teeth had gold fillings, and them Nazis took their share. Little here, a little there. Bunch of gold adds up over the years. Them Gypsies comes through these parts each year, with a carnival. They pitch their tents and then move on. And this part of the story is the part you best pay attention to, 'cause it's a fact, Jack. A week back, a man sat downstairs, got himself drunk at my bar. Kept going on about them Gypsies. Said he was one of those Romani. Told that tale about Jew gold, and how this clan, these carnies, were sitting on 10 bars of it. Said for the right price, he might know where they stash it. They pitch their carnival tents on a lot I got down by the rail yard, just outside Odessa. You're goin' with Logan and Billy to see if that gold story's true. You gotta be shittin' me. I got all sorts of friends collecting all sorts of envelopes. Clear your markers. Have that record of yours wiped clean. New start for you. Or I kill you right here and now. Gypsies, huh? Go figure. Three of you, going over to Odessa, coming back with Jew gold. You fuck it up, those two gonna take another initiative. They say if a dog howls for no reason, there's trouble coming. Gypsy lore. Lightening without rain, these are omens. That's just heat lightening. Yeah? Well, I find it best to be educated, so let's see. They navigate by moonlight. If it's obscured, they stay put. They never get married if a shoe falls out of a tree, and crows are bad luck. They put a curse on everything. How would a shoe fall from a tree? Well, it must have happened at some point if they're deciding something like marriage on it. Whoop-de fucking do, are we gonna do this shit or what? What are we waiting for? All right, tenderfoot. Now remember, we go in, we have a few drinks, then Logan and I will close out the tab. Now this is their last night, so they're gonna be partying. As soon as they're good and sauced up, Logan and I will go after the gold, you keep them distracted. You know where it's at? Well that's none of your business, Eli. You ain't gotta do shit but sit, drink, and entertain the pretty girls. That's all we need from you. Can you do that? I thought it was the beer. - Howdy. - Hey. We're looking for Marco. Boone's guys. That's right. Come on in. Welcome, gentlemen. Eh, a little fiesta before we leave town tomorrow. Yeah, this is great. You guys want beer? - Beer? - Please. Towne, beer for everyone, please, come on. So you're Marco. I am, yes. So you're having a little party? Oh yeah. Take a seat. Is that your sister? No no no no. Dude, watch out. Here we go, come on, Towne. There we go. - Everybody get a beer. - Thank you. Follow me in the back, gentlemen. Whoa Eli! - You're cute. - Eli, I'll be back. Got my eye on you. Can I help you with something? What are you doing here? Doing some business. Just doing some business. That's it. Yeah. Good. That's good. What's your fucking problem, huh? Roy Roy, Marco wants to see you. Now! Sorry about that, he's kind of a bad drunk. Here, please. I already got one. Thank you. I'm Gina. Hey. Where'd you learn to dance like that? It's very traditional in my culture. Taught very young. I never seen it before. Maybe you'll have to try. I could teach. I don't think I could ever learn to do that, hand, you know, whatever that was, the leg shaking stuff. I'd love to see you do this. So what are you doing here? Just finishing up some business. With uh, whatever, boss man is in there. Did you get a chance to take part in the festivities? No. Shame, we leave tomorrow. Maybe I'll catch you on the next one. All right. Ever seen a medium before? What? Fortune teller. Oh no, no. I, I don't have much fortune. I don't think. Well this one's special. I'm not a talker, you know? That's, that's what it is. It's good to know, I like that. What are we doing here? What's your name, handsome? What are we doing here? I don't know yet. But I don't know one shouldn't pass up a reading if she's willing. And that this is our last night. And I don't know anything about you. James. Mr. James. I'll be right back. What am I doing here? Have a seat. Are you serious? Give her your hand. Says you're easy on the eyes. You're impatient. You've come through quick hardship. You keep secrets. A burden. My hands are scarred from work. Skin's leather from the sun and everybody keeps secrets. Should've pulled out that crystal ball. At least it would've looked the part. She says you're going to die. Everybody dies. Some sooner than others. You not save her. Drink. Straight down. This is a real show, stranger. You are why she burns. Why who burns? Mother. What the fuck she just say? She said your mother. That tea. You run from something unspeakable. It's not finished with you. You came to settle the debt? Can't move. You've come for our gold. ♪ My Mom she died in a fire she set ♪ ♪ The law man was stated while daddy wept ♪ Raven tea packs a punch, don't it? What the fuck happening, man? What'd you put in that shit? Your boss sold you out, broth a. Dead and buried. Those were his words. Can you watch her? I'm gonna go help them start closing up. Ah. This is worth a lot more than money. Goes way back with us. But you, you didn't do it for gold. It was different for you. Oh, don't pretend to know me. You're a low rent homicidal Gypsy cult.

There's something beautiful and loving, and it is there for a reason. It is, it's there so I can give it to somebody else. I need to give it. If I don't then, then only the hollow exists. I um, I want a child because I need to give love. What the fuck? No, no no no no no no. Ross? Yeah? - See you. - Okay. Yeah, good to see you. You get my calls? He just showed up. I mean, we gotta talk about this but I gotta go. All right, I'll catch you later, all right, Eli? All right, take care. Yeah. You have no right showing up like this. Well now, he didn't seem to feel the same way. I told you I didn't want to talk about it. Good, all you gotta do is listen. Eli. Hear me out, and I won't bother you about it no more. You look rode hard and put away wet. Yet you get prettier every day. God, Mary, it don't matter where I lay my head. I left a heap of trouble back in Texas. Skipped my parole. It's a matter of time before it catches up to me. This letter. I know what it says. Okay, well then, then you know what they're offering.
