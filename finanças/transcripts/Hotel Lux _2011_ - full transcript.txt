This is the night sky from the 1939th This makes for most no difference. But for astrologers he's like tomorrow's newspaper, which can be read today. If there were this newspaper, I would like to subscribe to, because never did my stars betray me. When I thought of stars so far, I thought of Hollywood, of good cognac and hotels. Yes it may not always be the same five-star hotels. There are nice hotels around the world, 3 or 4 stars, sometimes only 2 But this place here has only one star. This would have a need to make even skeptical. Welcome to the Mecca of communism, welcome to Moscow. Here they live, Communists from all over the world. High officials, many German, who had to leave their homes because they were communists. Here the foundation is poured for the big communist world building. My name is Hans Zeisig. I am not a communist, I'm a comedian. But why I hang here is anything but funny. My story begins in January 1933 in Berlin. With the most decent, most humorous, most wonderful person, I ever allowed to call me friend. But his political stance made me a little worried. Communism is the only way out of the mess. - Your beard is crooked. - Can you give a laugh. - Do not we have enough? - Laughs you can never have enough. We were the stars in vaudeville Valetti. And while there Communists and Nazis fought, our program hit like a bomb. (Music) Who starts? I! I begin. I always catch on! Remember: He started it. Sunny day, blissful days, beating heart and the motor is a blow, laughing goal, laughing start and beautiful trip. Rome and Madrid, we conquer you so life goes for two in a tumble! Across the sea, on the land, we realized that: A friend, a good friend, that's the most beautiful thing there is in the world. A friend is always a friend, and if the whole world collapses. So be not grieved even if your sweetheart no longer loves you. A friend, a good friend, this is the greatest treasure there is. And dance! Do you see the redhead? - I see only black. - You always only see black. One must be blind not to see them. I do not dance to your tune! A friend, a good friend, - that's the best ... - You think this is funny? - Take care of your own stuff, Kessel. - Take out this number. Freedom of expression, Kessel. That's why Hitler doesn't hang around here. - you have put it on the wall. - I'll hang him. - They laugh, Meyer, they love it! - Still, Zeisig, yet. Good boy! Good boy! Mental perversion! Comparing the leader with this Bolshevik criminal! They heard a speech by Dr. Goebbels. Our future propaganda minister with a dog! Hold your breath. Heil Hitler! (Laughter) The monkey is unfortunately good. Tell me, Valetti, it is a stage name? but you are called Goldberg, right? It stinks here anyway. Kessel was an actor. He tried to compensate for his lack of talent with a Nazi Party membership. The number of the crafty Jew was a matter of taste. But Valetti had to include such numbers. So that the Nazis didn't take apart his place. I can't stand this swine anymore. Oi, violence! Your purse or your life. - He came before us. - He would not come. I'm going to Valetti and puttinf my foot down. First the monkey, then the Jew, then us. No, you throw out him and the Nazi. Or postpone for 5 numbers. It sounds complicated, but it is not. - I'll show you ... - I thought you want more salary. As it should be in this farce. And you want to change my carefully planned and harmonous programme! - We are just actors. - Then you'd be at the theatre. - Is that the new harmony? - The devil, Meyer, that is you! - Oh ... Yes ... - Yes. The imitation is always better than the real thing. - All right. But since you mentioned it, how about a small raise ... - Get out! - Nicely did you hit the table. - But a very good conversation. - What's that? - What does it look like? Anecdote? - I'm in the KP. - Beinf a Jew is not enough for you?. Dying alone is not enough for me. And if the catch me, - I'll take a few of the pigs with me. - Then they will catch you. And then the pigs will take you with them. And so my friend Meyer becomes a street fighter. His passion for the theater is fading. He arrived just too late. And I, I was pissed. - Shit mastics! Does not stick. - I will use wood glue. I play it today in sunglasses. Perhaps puts on a new trend among dictators. - So I think it is shit. - Be glad I'm there at all. - Play Hitler yourself, you wanted to. - Nothing is easier than this Small moustache, spray like am elephant, rolling "R", done. - But Stalin 's difficult character! - Hans. This is my last appearance today, I go underground. - Where? - Underground, I have no choice. But Hollywood! Meyer, remember? The two of us, first Berlin, then the whole world. Read it, what is written here. JBW silver Steen, talent scout. - Leave it. - Hollywood. H-o-l-l-y-wood! - Why are not you already there? - Because he has not called. In Wedding there was a shooting today. The red pigs got whipped good. - And you, take that thing off! Nope! - Crap! - It can't be smeared. - On the stage! Well, Quasimodo? Foretaste of what is to come. Hey, hey! Stop! - Have you lost your mind! Holy shit. - Now you'll get one! (Music) Yes! Hail Hitler! - It is just for artists. - We are artists. Stop! Freeze! An autograph for me? - For sure. - Not him. You! Oh. Yeah, right. As you have given it to the crafty Jew, great. New number? - Yes. - Please sign FÃ¼hrer. The comrades who will roll around. Thank you! Pen! - Hail Hitler! - Hail Hitler! I'd also like one. To my best friend. See you soon. Do you have the papers? Just go straight out to the street and scream loudly! Good. See What the moustache does. (Music) May I? Well, of course. - I saw you on stage. You were funny. - I saw you in the stalls. You laughed and you were very nice. I'll be quick. I do not understand. I thought you want to offer company to a lonely artist tonight? You thought I am a fan, as the Americans say? You poor guy. - Ah, our Dutch comrade. - Where are you, comrade? - Comrade? - Frida von Orten. - Comrade. - You also? - I will get the papers. - Oh ... - Can you trust him? - Can you? - Under torture, I betray everything. - Does he mean that? For the party masses are suspicious. Masses interest him only at the box office. I'm in a party. I am the founder and only member. The Egoistenpartei. I know. But you are but certainly not the only member. Well then good luck. I will wait in the car for you. If you do not know where ... I have an excellent record collection. - You can not make it, huh? - She is great. - Yes. - You know where to find me. - You should also disappear. - In a year of nightmare is over. - Brown shit is not easy to clean. - I'll wait for you here. - don't wait too long. - Take care. - Take care Meyer. Siggi? You're the best Hitler, has it ever been. (Music) Soon after, the Reichstag burned. For the Nazis, it was the Communists. You created a list of all the important figures of the Communist Party. And chased them. Three years later, the fate drove Frida right into my arms. She came at an inconvenient time, because I was just showing a colleague my record collection. However, I've never had a woman as quickly in my bed as her. (Beat) Are you alone? Who are you? - Frida. - Who is the woman? Lisa. I'm his sister. - Lisa! Where have you been so long? - I have to go into hiding for a night. I should have known. My mother always warned me against such men. - Where is Meyer? - I dont know. I'm very tired. I need to sleep here. What makes you think they aren't looking here? - You are a harmless clown. - Oh, harmless. - In these times, a nice compliment. - You are not on the list. - That reassures me somehow. - You're a pacifist. - That's a great luxury in these times. - Yes, I love the luxury. And you, I see, too. An heirloom. I've given up a lot. If you want to change the world, one has to make sacrifices. And you? - Why are you still here? - I'm waiting for Meyer. Someone has to be there so when he returns. The Germans are setting up camps because the prisons are not enough, - and sing songs? - Someone has to sing, yes. - You are a coward. - Yes. And I am eager to say so. If I had a family crest, it would be the trembling hare. (Jazz music) I would not play. Negro music. If you have neighbors who might call the Gestapo. (Musik: You Are My Sunshine) If we had met each other only under different circumstances. Under other circumstances, we would not know each other. I would never have intercourse with someone like you. - Where can I lie down? - Take the bedroom. ("You Are My Sunshine") I lay on the hard carpet. Or I push myself along the two uncomfortable chairs. Maybe I lay me in the cold tub or on piano. Come here! Your bed is big enough. Proletarian families live in spaces that are sometimes less than this bed. Can I trust you? Not under torture. (Beat) (Exciting music) I forgot something. Pig! (Music) The men disappeared, as did the humour. It was the year '38, and the roles were redistributed. Valetti fled and left his beautiful vaudeville. - I will take over your role? - Yes, and I can say, quite honestly, can't imagine a better actor for the role of the cunning Jews as the ever-popular operetta star Hans Zeisig. Damn! Man, man, you ... You old workhorse, you. Here, the role. And b reak a leg. Hail Hitler. By the way, do you remember Mr Meyer? We've caught him. He now makes the comrades in the camp Oranienburg laugh, if he does not know ... Well, are not so choosy. Just do it. He only wants you to refuse. - Come on, do it. Oh, it will not hurt anyone. - Yes, me. It will hurt me. The cunning Jew to the stage. Quickly! You can do it. I'm not a hero, but as Frida had said? A harmless clown? (murmur) Laugh if you please! We have resources to make everyone laugh! If a child with grass, I ask the child: "Why grass and no flowers, my child?" The child says: "My mother always says that the leader should as soon as possible bite the dust." Well, then I will pack the luggage. - A joke, a laugh. - You are fired! Next in the program. The ladies get on the stage! (Music) 'Good evening. Would you have probably an autograph for me? - Should I sign with Stalin or Hitler? - How about Bolshevik Jewish pig? Jew and Pig's fine, but Bolshevik ... Dear Mr. Silver Steen, unfortunately I could not wait for your call. I had the cabaret from private exit and artistic reasons. If you hold this letter in your hands, I'm on my way to you. Your Hans Zeisig, comedian. The masters! as we look forward! - Do you have the papers? - Yes, but you have to be flexible. The pass was for someone else, and who might be at any moment there. It does not say Hollywood. Is the Arabic? - No, Russian. - Why Russian? - What does that mean? - Lohmann. - As? - Lohmann, your new name. American passports are run out. The Soviet Union's anti-fascist youwill be safe. Go to this hotel and then to the American Embassy. - Hotel Lux? Is that in Baedeker? - No, in Moscow. Since all descend. - Mr. Hansen? - Yes. - I told you I will sign! - The goods have to be already there. Crap. - You have to go. - Yes, yes, but Mr. Lohmann has a beard. And what am doing for a I living? I do not fit the photos to people, but vice versa. Get out at last. (Exciting music) 'Good evening. Hey, you. After! Hey! Freeze! (Exciting music) Back to the theater. There are even more like him. Crap. - Hey, he is running away. - Do not move or I'll shoot! Crap! (Shot) With a false beard, false names and false papers I actually managed to cross two borders to Moscow. Now I just needed a hot bath, a hot meal and a soft bed. So I was arrived at the Hotel Lux, to me, the weary exile Hans Zeisig, or, if you like, Lohmann, should provide accommodation for one night. (Music) Good evening. Would you bring my luggage up to my room, please? Thank you. (He clears his throat.) Sir, please... Can I have the best room with the best view of the city? Okay I got it. I have understood, I'm not deaf. Here you have your propusk. Yes. Of course, I see. I'd also think of it first may come. Here. So, I did not want to ... I'd like to speak to the hotel manager. Ah, you are the hotel manager. Good. I have a complaint. Stalin. All right, I withdraw my complaint. Cheers! (He sings a tune.) Yes. Yes / Yes. Uh ... no. Yes and no. Who that? That's you, and that is Stalin. Stalin. Friend. Very good friend. - Understand? Understand? - Yes. There. My friend. (Music) Toothache ... tooth. - tooth? - Aching! aching. - What? - Aching. I'll be your interpreter with the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs, Comrade Yezhov, translate. (Music) Towaritsch Lohmann? Comrade Lohmann? - No. (Russian) No one comes to us under their own name. And with beards there are two ways If you have one, you have to shave it, you do not have, you have to let it grow. Or, if the time is too short, stick it on. We make it here with wood glue, which sometimes last a lifetime. You can believe me. I am a pro. Well, what did I say? Good. My real name is Hans Zeisig, I'm a popular actor. I am and was a great admirer of Stalin. I had nothing to hide, so I told him everything. The part with Frida I left out. I did not want to embarrass them. My report seemed to impress Mr. Yezhov - Ja... that's life. - That's life. Ãh... c'est la vie. (Russian) Forget everything from now you have a new identity. - Kurt Walter? - Yes. (Russian) And tell me one more thing: What will be tomorrow? What do you mean? Reply! Tomorrow will be sunny, at night it snowed, and I'm out of here. The sun? The sun has not shone here for months. (Russian) (Frida) We'll see. (Russian) Welcome to the Hotel Lux, Mr ... Walter. - Frida. - Hush! What is the meaning of that? What are you doing here? - Are not you excited? - You idiot. - Excitement looks different, Frida. - My name is Clara! The last time we met, you were still Lisa. Here. - Have you forgotten me. - No. Only the memory left in a useless time. Why can I not be with you? The Nazis persecuted me, - now I'm here. - You've got the false passport. What can you do - I explained you translated. What? How did you get the passport, that the NKVD smuggled into Germany, with the help from a gay artist named Mama to deliver it to a certain Hansen? Are you naive! - I have translated about it. - Why not? - Because you would then no longer be alive. - Hands up! - Do not move or we'll shoot! - There you are! Into the room! Leave Comrade Clara and her guest alone. But Comrade Mueller said we should observe and report anything. MÃ¼ller, you pig! So now I've caught you! So you always secretly sneak in and take the food. This is the annex of the Comintern, there are no secrets. A room with a window onto the courtyard. Quiet and shady. - Are all the rooms as mundane? - Only on the official corridor, comrade. - Kurt Walter, Frida. - Clara. - Clara. But who is this Hansen? This is the residents of this room, Comrade Walter. So Comrade Walter, who was previously the comrade Lohmann? - You do not know it yourself, right? - I agree. Do you have too much water? (Water noise) - Why are you here? - I ask myself the same thing. - What is your goal? - You know my goal. You! You are my goal. As we did in Berlin, the two of us, the last time, almost together, so ... Since then I have not slept with any other woman. Few times maybe. Because they have been begging like that. Frida, I ... - Clara! - Clara, Frida, Lisa, it does not matter. I just always thought of the light radiant with you. And that leaves this world more serene, beautiful and clear for me, Clara. Yes, it was not always easy for me. What a chatterbox, you. Babblers, we have enough. I hate squeaky beds. Did you think you will come in here and move to the USA? - Yes, little detour. To take you. - You did not know that I'm here. - I've felt Frida. - Clara. Come on, before it's too late. I am a different person. - No. Good, but you can change me. You could change me. - you can not change. - That you are the one - who wants to change the world. - The world can be changed. Not you. (Music) Come on, huh? Hollywood. Have you heard of Meyer? Mh mh-. Good night. (Beat) (Russian) Open up! Open! (A woman screams.) (Exciting music) If you're not disappeared at 3, I will hit you. 1... 2... Well, we can get along. Note: Never go to a country where you can not read the street names. And then I also had another problem. Excuse my curiosity. But Comrade Fischer used to live here, a good friend. He ordered a closet from me. Is none at all to see. He probably built this panel instead of it. A little bit hollow, but very good. What I call a case, huh? How long shall we stay? Wilhelm, Chairman of the Communist Party and secretary of the ECCI. So you're the new comrade? We wanted to say hello. Walter. - Lotte, Walter's right hand. I am a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party and representatives of the Central Committee of the ECCI. - Then I now know everything. - And what are you doing here? Kurt Funk. - No, no, Kurt Walter. - Comintern? - What? - What is the mission? Comrades, we here do not violate the rules of conspiracy. Johannes R. Becher. Poet. For 6 months, he is writing his ode, but no one has heard something. - In December, is in fact his birthday. - No, his. Ah, Jesus's? - Stalin's. - There are still exactly 11 days. - 12, comrade. - I told you. 12th - I've heard even 11 days. - I agree. - Fact is fact, my dear. - Do you want to accuse me of something? (Music) You can not babble! A monstrous suspicion. I know when is Stalin's birthday! I said 12, but the comrades say I would have said 11 That can cost me my life! (Conversation in Italian) (Music) Ah yes. Propusk. I have, I have. From Germany I got out, but not out of this shit Hotel. - Well, where do you want to go? - to stretch the legs a bit. With the suitcase? - Ja. - On the. - Where are they all going? - To the Comintern, to work. - They's so in a hurry. - The battle for the seats on the bus. Only the German comrades remain. Party meeting. shot on the run! Really? That's the ball from Karli, huh? I can give to your mother! What are you doing there? Karli, come out! Plays some proper games! Hide and seek, for example Oh yes, Karlie's turn. A. What! Nope. So, this is sloppy, comrades. but you can not nail Josef Stalin in the corner! Here in the centre! So here ... Schick. (Marlene) 1, 2, 3, 4, Coming, everything must be hidden. 1, 2, 3, 4, Coming, everything must be hidden. - I will tell on you. - What? Why? - You're a Trotskyite. - I'm not! Comrade Walter? Crap. I do not know what 's Trotskyist. - stop stalking me. - he left. Then what are you if you are not a Trotskyist? I'm Mickey Mouse. Papa says Mickey Mouse is an asshole. - (Marlene) Bertchen! - The will find me. - Why? - Because this is a shit hiding place. - We have found you! - Who is that? - Mickey Mouse. - But Mickey Mouse is an asshole. Oh, Mickey Mouse is not asshole. Mickey is American. He has such big ears, much larger than the intelligence has. He is homesick here in Moscow. I give the floor to the Secretary, Comrade Clara, who has a good reason for being late. I will read the agenda. Those who vote "yes", raise their hand. 1: Discussion of the measures to combat Trotskyite pests. We've done it outside the agenda. 2: preparing the celebrations for the birthday of our great leader, Comrade Stalin. Over the roof you come into the other wing. The iron door on the right in the courtyard leads to the kitchen. - Then to the restaurant and on the street. - Here, take that, you pig! - He has ruined everything. - Who? What? Trotsky! The October Revolution, the joy of my parents' marriage ... - Ah, so he is like that. - You know nothing, Mickey Mouse! The 18th Congress of the Bolsheviks and the international working class. 13: Revealing Trotskyist Gestapo agents. - Thanks for Keeping tight. - Are you really Mickey Mouse? And your love is sad when you are not with her. If there is nobody for you, you're lonely. Said Lenin. So, kids, where's the American Embassy? The people change, the objectives change. Or was it vice versa? And now? Onrush to the east. World war plans of the fascists. Registration for the course "History of the Communist Party of the USSR". 29 ... 33 ... Greetings for the comrades in the tractor factory Red Flag. Alcohol ban in the cooperative apartment Kjesnewski-Moss. Clothing collection for needy comrades. 69: Voting on the design of the New Year's celebration. Would anyone like to add something? Not? Good. Continue. Comrade, what do you have against the agenda? - Nothing. - What? Nothing. My right shoulder hurts. I lift my arm to relieve them. - Do you represent the comrade. - We do not deviate from the agenda. We know that's comrade Kurt Walter. But what really interests us here in the hall: What brings him to us? Love. Only here I realized how important it is to be with the people you love. Above everything. For the first time in my life I spoke openly about my feelings. The response was overwhelming. People, hear the signals. In the last fight. The International unites the human race. - You have both put us under threat! - How so? - Why have you raised your arm? - For the order. And what is all this talk about love? You idiot! Do you understand? I will have to watch you! Day and night, like a child. And you act like a child! You can not be gone. things you imagined, are not right We are very vigilant. Do you think you can just leave and yell for the American Embassy? You go out, you need a propusk. - For Moscow, you need a Stadtpropusk. - And for the loo you need a shitpropusk! We are working on the most important problem in living memory! - Clear. - And who is not with you, is your enemy. - You're in a music-hall of the hotel! - Clear! I am here on my free will! - bring everything up! - Are you coming to a party meeting! - Because of you! - And talking about something about ... - Love? Yes! Idiot. (Beat) Stay like that. (Music) You have to help me, Georgi. Are you sure he is not a spy? He ended up on the run from the Gestapo here by accident. Random? Here? In Lux? - No one accidentally comes into Lux -. I can trust him. And now? Where is he now? They picked him up. I do not know where they took him. You have to find out who he is mistaken for. If Yezhov undertands that he has the wrong guy, Zeisig is dead. (Exciting music) (Zirpen) (Exciting music) (Stalin speaks Russian.) We can talk now. (Russian) How do you like the Soviet Union, Mr. Hansen? Well, Mr. Stalin. But you do not know yet, you were only in this terrible hotel. Thirsty? Yes. What I don't like in Germans is that you can not drink. - What do you think? Am I drunk? - No. Dissimilar. I'm drunk as 1,000 Cossacks on Shrove Tuesday. Do you have it? What do I have? Do you have it? Sure I did, but not here. When shall I get it for you? (He translates.) Do not lie to me! - Do you have it in there? - There. - There? - Yes there. I got it in there. I think. Yes, of course I've got it in there. Are you afraid? If I was not afraid, I'd be stupid, Mr. Stalin, huh? I like your answer. You smoke cigarettes? American? Only prop. Your predictions should be quite precise. I want you to predict my future. Now I knew who they mistook me for. And why the name Hansen seemed all the time so well known to me. I was mistaken for the body astrologers of Adolf Hitler. (Music) The knowledge of the stars. You have it. And now you give it to me. Good. The hits me a little bit unprepared, but good. Uranus! Moon! The Uranus moon constellation reach Saturn and migrates into the seventh house, where the ascendant travels in the fifth house, where Aquarius, Virgo and Sagittarius are waiting for us. My name is Hansen and I want to talk immediately to the hotel manager. Pass. - Hansen? - Hansen, yes! Hansen! (Exciting music) You know Hitler? Who does not know him? Hitler has friends? Not many. But I'm one of them. - Baron Munchausen! - No that is the truth. One moment. Second. To my best friend. Why are we not friends, Hitler and I? he used the exact same words: "Why can I not be friends with Stalin?" (He translates.) - It would be possible? - This one does not consult the stars. Astrologers are still something like doctors or priests. - Can I trust you? - Yes. I ask for confidentiality. Do you have confidentiality? - Yes! - Then this conversation is between you and me. - No! My friend. (Music) Friend! Good friend. - Very good. - Yes. - And. - And. (He sings.) A friend, a good friend, that's the most beautiful thing there is in the world. And if the whole world collapses. I just wanted to see who's singing such beautiful German songs. Vassily Ulrich, chairman of the Supreme Military Court. and a friend, a good friend of Comrade Stalin. From now on, your service personnel. Yes. Good night. Good night. Good friend. Good night. - 'Good evening. - 'Good evening. - Good. Who are you? - Who are you? Who are you? You are in my room. This room has been reserved for me from the top. - I know you from somewhere. - I know you too. - (Both) Hansen. - I beg your pardon? Hansen! Who is? Hm? Who? I'm Hansen. The man is an impostor. I'll show you my passport. - I'm inclined to believe you. Just ... - Everyone makes mistakes. You, me, him. Comrade Stalin will still understand that. You don't need to overreact. Mr. Hansen is where he was going, and I can travel where I want to go. We do not make mistakes. I am so sorry. Zeisig is dead. - Come on, Mr. Zeisig. - I do not know Zeisig. - Come! - I'm Hansen! - I'm telling you all the time ... Ah! - Without blood, idiot. I was an astrologer. Not just any astrologer, but Stalin's astrologer. I had to be the one for which they held me. And I understood what it means to play for your life. (Music) It was not all ended up in the attic! Secret chambers in these times are very valuable. Not only for banned books. - The is such an important squad? - No one knows its function. - It is a secret probably, like everything here. - He does not look like the squad. Thanks to Stalin's orders, I got the best seat in the restaurant. And at events I had a seat in the first row. My reputation in the hotel grew from day to day. Only just one I could not impress. - What is this disguise? - I told you: - Where I am is vaudeville. - You've understood nothing. - Sir. - Sir. - friends. - friends. - sight. - sight. seeings. seeings. - Friends! - friends. (Stalin speaks Russian.) Again a private conversation? The celebrations on Stalin's birthday lasted unusually long. But at some point, every birthday was over. Lenin's death anniversary came and went. Then came the international fight and holiday of the working class. And whether I liked it or not, I was now one of them. And Frida? She went out of my way, wherever it was possible. it did not sound bitter, you might say: As in any hotel guests came and went. But those who went only traveled at night. For them there was no why and no whither. Mama? You are doing exactly what I said. Karl, take care of the kids. She is a Trotskyist. Hansen is Hitler's astrologer. When did you know that? It is our unique chance to eliminate Yezhov. When Stalin understands that the wrong man is with him, then this dwarf is dead. Do you know why I'm here? Because of you! You used to be my hero. If communism has such people, I thought when you have ridiculed Goering in front of the Supreme Court and around the world, When they have that kind of people, they will win. What happened to you? Do you know what they will call this time? The time of the great purge. (Music) Hi, comrade. My name is... No, no, I am Meyer. Member of the Communist Party of Germany. I've got a very long journey behind me. Here. Propusk. One jet Propusk? (Music) Shall We Dance? - I even decorated everything. - Ah yes. So do you imagine an erotic atmosphere for young communists, huh? - Yes. - I have to go. - How do ...? - The party needs pilots. Farewell. Moment. There are variations of "good-bye". "Farewell like" See you soon "or" See you in two weeks. " - Which do you mean? - The "Let it go well with you" version. - What can I do to get your chains off! - What chains? The "We proletarians have nothing to lose but our chains" chains. You are not a proletarian. - You neither. but I am a communist. (Music) I have to leave in 5 minutes. Or 10 Where? We are building a railway line. - railway line? - From Baikal to the Amur. - Amur? - Amur. Which is over 3,800 km long. (He whistles.) And it is very, very far away. Hm. It does not knock. - So what is that? - Siggi! - What are you doing here? - I was tired! Frida, what are you doing here? - We're trying to save the world. - (Frida) You survived! - What are you doing here? - I'm being happy. - He is a state guest. - I can speak Russian! - And you are lying on my wife. - Yes! What? - We are married. - Party marriage ... - Yes, party marriage. - What's this? I think I need to sit down first. They married on party command. During the day they were a middle-class couple, at night they distributed leaflets. I know she does not really love me. - moment. Who I like and love, I still decide myself. It is time comrade, we have to leave. When I come back, I want to see you alive. Both. And Frida went as she thought, to serve Communism. But where they wanted to go, they never arrived. Meyer told me about his escape. He still believed in communism. But that should change soon. That's what I already said 100 times. Outdoor use. Clean shit houses. (Exciting music) Did they tell you that you should tell us that story? - What? Who again? You make a very good liar. - Well, here ... Gestapo. - What? - Gestapo. - So again: - A guard has swallowed a wasp. - tracheotomy! - Can someone tracheotomy? - What? - tracheotomy! - What? - I am a doctor. - Shut up. A wasp, was it? Do something, anything! Do something! Crap! Freeze! Crap! Freeze! We believe you, yes, but there is always the suspicion you've just come to spy here. And because of your contacts with Trotskyist, SR and terrorist spy Wollenberg. You've got into trouble and thought: In the USSR, the fascists or Trotskyists can not touch me. In Paris you hid at Wollenberg's and in Prague at Kish's? Yes. Yes, but! Participation in the Trotskyist-terrorist organization by Wollenberg and Hoelz. Or at the Trotskyite-bucharistisch- terrorist organization Anitkomintern of the fallen enemies Pyatnitsky, Knorin and Kun. In conjunction with the trotzkischtisch- sinowjewischen- terrorist center were and in parallel to the parallel buchinarischtischen center. You'll have to tell him: Comrade Stalin, unfortunately, that was a mistake. The biggest secret in the world has fucked up and sent you a capitalist comedian. You and we all are the laughingstock of the fascist world. (Exciting music) When I visited Stalin for the last time, he was strikingly nervous. Apparently I had more influence on this man as I liked. There have been secret talks between Stalin and Hitler. Stalin had made Germany a secret list. As a confidence-building measure he was the man to send back to the Reich A death-list. And Meyer also was on the list. (Exciting music) (Dramatic music) - Hands up! Ping! - Ow! (Russian) Where is he, damn it? This is a shit hiding. Hello. (Exciting music) (Russian calls) Stop! You ... you stop. Help me. They arrest the Germans and send them home to the Reich. I've seen the lists. The green book. I am in there too. Waiting in the attic for me. You're dead. You too. - I was always a loyal servant of the party! - Meyer. - Mayer! - Yes! - What are you yelling about like that? - You have no chance! - Hide yourself in my room. - Get out! (Russian) - MÃ¼ller! - Kurt. We are friends forever, right? I love you. You can trust me. Come on, hurry up. (Russian) (Exciting music) I am a party member! Here! - Here's the pig! Here! - MÃ¼ller! Stay here! Leave me alone, you Trotzkist pig! Do not shoot! You're welcome! Everything OK! (Exciting music) (Music) (They laugh.) You do not have to worry yet. You are a very important person. A close confidant of Stalin. Already forgotten? (Exciting music) Come along. Ah! Well, somehow I don't know anymore myself. This here is certainly a confusing situation for you. But you can tell where your accomplice Meyer is hiding. Ah, he's not here? Then he's off and away. That reassures me somehow. You can well imagine that we are not unprepared. Do not worry, we will not hurt you. In brief: Where is Meyer? Such a beautiful woman. Hans, you will say nothing now. They will kill me anyway. First me, then you ... Right? May I just say something? Few suggestions to you. Does not take long. Yes, I'm an actor. I just wanted to take a night of your hospitality to complete, to sleep and then on to Hollywood. Film is my passion. Instead, I'm stuck here. One of the most beautiful languages ââin the world! With 6 cases. and the longest and unpronounceable words like ... And I learned what true friendship. And what is love. If you have found a way out of this maze, I would like to come back to your beautiful country to look at him as well. Good night my friend! - We'll meet again. - Yes. - Promise it! - I promise. Nowhere else you could feel the effects of fear, Mistrust and betrayal in the ranks of the Communists as the Lux. The hallways were empty, the doors sealed and the most honest comrades on a long journey, returned by the very few. Those who were allowed to remain, earmarked for higher tasks. - Wat are you doing here? - Nothing, just nothing. In the early hours of August 23 1939, everything was ready. There was a knock on my door. - I hear something. - Immediately open! - Now they have come for me. - But not you. Nope. Not for me. Go see. Do you know what time it is? Of course you can trust me! I came before Ribbentropp to visit my friend. Discreet. And so it was that a small communist stood before his great leader. Or was it vice versa? Yes. That's right. My name is Hans Zeisig. I'm a comedian. I don't not kill people, I make them laugh. A famous colleague said: "To tears you laugh, you do not cry." Frida was right. I am a pacifist and cowardly. But once one has the opportunity no one else has in this situation ... I despise all forms of violence, I even could not violate a rat. But in this case it was necessary to throw the principles overboard. And now? This is a celebration! You do not believe what I just saw. - Stalin's here. And Hitler. - I do not think so. (Music) (Dramatic music) (Music: "A friend, a good friend") (Music) No. We can not get through. - If we die, only one thing ... - Yes, I love you. And from the beginning. You idiot. Towaritsch Sta ... For people and country! And now God help us. Yes, Mr. von Ribbentrop. (Choir singing the German national anthem) You've just missed. Sorry? (Russian) - The Chancellor was there in front of you. - That can not be. He sends his apologies, he had to stay in Berlin. (Russian) - But who is sitting on the plane then? - I wonder about that too. Dear Mr. Silversteen. Maybe you remember us. You kindly offered us work in vaudeville Valetti. We were delayed for a few years, but now we are on the way to you. Please reserve us a single and a double. There are three of us. If possible, in a hotel with more than one star. We are open to everything, even for small roles. But we can also imagine that Hitler and Stalin performers are in high demand in the coming years. My friend Meyer and I are the ideal candidates. Frida and I will get married, have children, grow old together, live in a nursing home in Florida, and you'll be fine. Believe me, Mr. Silversteen. It's set in the stars. And with stars I know my way. (Music) Oh, yes: On that day, August 23, 1939 Foreign Minister v. Ribbentrop met Stalin. From this encounter a photo exists. And if you look closely, you can see it: Stalin's moustache was askew.
