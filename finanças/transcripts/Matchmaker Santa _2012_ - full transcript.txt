BUT THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND IS VERY ROMANTIC. ALL RIGHT, MELANIE. SPELL IT OUT FOR ME. OH, IT'S A LONG STORY. I'VE GOT TIME. WELL, JUSTIN SENT DEAN TO PICK ME UP AT THE AIRPORT, AND THE CAR BROKE DOWN, SO WE GOT STRANDED IN THIS LITTLE TOWN WHICH TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY CHARMING PLACE. AND WE MET THIS MAN NAMED CHRIS WHO PLAYS SANTA. SHE SKIPPED RIGHT OVER THE ROMANTIC PART. OKAY, WELL, DO YOU REMEMBER HOW YOU WERE ASKING ME ABOUT FINDING THE RIGHT GUY, YOU KNOW, FINDING MY PRINCE CHARMING? UH-HUH. WELL, I FOUND HIM. DEAN? YES. [laughs] YOU STOLE MY DREAM GUY. HOW WILL I EVER FORGIVE YOU? I JUST FEEL-- I JUST FEEL SO RELAXED WHEN I'M WITH HIM. YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE HE'S TAUGHT ME TO JUST ENJOY THE SIMPLE THINGS AGAIN.
