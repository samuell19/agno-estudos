This programme contains some strong language from the start. OK, so... I'm really bad with family tree stuff, by the way! So... I'll start with... me. I'd describe myself as objective, logical, obsessed with specific topics. Like, I don't have much emotion. I've grown up being told that I'm weird, that I'm not normal enough for people. So I've felt like I've not really had anyone around, growing up. I know Oli has constantly wanted deep friendships, but has never been able to achieve them. Sterling... Sarah, Spencer... Sibling number 15. Oh, Melissa. Sibling number 12. Oh, Lindsay. Number 20. I think I'm sibling number 22. 13. 14. Number seven. Number eight. I'm so confused by this. Number one. Three. Two. 26. I have 26 siblings. That's two baseball teams! We're all kind of new to this. We're the first generation that this situation has ever applied to. Is that...? Any I'm missing? I feel like there's... No... No. The plan is to fly from state to state in America, meeting some of these siblings, where they live, then have one big reunion at the end in California. I think his intention, going into this journey, is definitely to feel loved. He feels that these siblings, there's this shorthand, they're just going to go, "Bam! I get you." What do you want to get out of this? Jesus Christ, like, just fucking one, at least, strong, good, healthy relationship. This whole thing started because I was curious about my biological family. So I signed up to US websites that helps children of sperm donors find each other. About six months ago, I got this email from someone called Jordan, erm, with the subject line, "Nice to meet you." Erm, "Hi, Oliver. "I know this must be a bit overwhelming for you, "but I've lots to tell you. "We're all so excited to know you, "and when I say we, I mean not only your donor, Daley, "who I'm in contact with, "but - deep breaths - "your 24 other half-siblings. "Hopefully we can talk soon. "Smiley face." I knew that my donor existed, but it was some mystical thing that was in the back of my head. I didn't know how many siblings I had. I knew nothing. And it's, like, oh, fuck, OK. This giant dynamic that I was totally unaware of. My first... When all this happened, my first thought was, this is a joke. This is a wind-up. In a gay relationship, you try to have the child as connected as you possibly can with your partner. The only way that we saw it working was to take one egg from one, fertilise it externally and put into the other one. I was the carrier. Oli is the first child of egg transfer to be born in the UK. When choosing a donor, what was top criteria? Anonymous. Yep. Glaringly obvious. What? Identity release. No. You don't want a third party knocking on the door. We had a choice and we wanted to protect that family unit. My donor. He was just a number. But he decided to take himself off the anonymous thing and make himself a known donor. Some of the siblings, they started to find each other through DNA testing and also sibling registries. Pretty much almost all of them, for years, had been meeting up, going to reunions. And it's like our lifelong dream coming true. I cannot stop smiling! Something New by Axwell and Ingross # Cos we belong to something # We belong to something # We belong to something new. # Oh, my gosh, I just think it would have been amazing to be there. Everybody say hi to the group Insta! Hello! We may be going to get impulse tattoos at some point today. Cheers! When I met them and when I spent time with them, I just got such a warm, fuzzy feeling that I've never experienced before. It sort of felt like I actually have these people that will have my back, but it sort of turned out quite differently. Why? WhatsApp. In the beginning, it was great. It went quite well, actually. I think, emotionally, his Asperger's is very clear in the way that he doesn't feel in the same way that perhaps you or I would feel. I like things like carnivorous plants... What's in there? Oh, those are my Madagascan hissing cockroaches. He's hard-wired differently. I've got some glass catfish. It's really cool. And why is that cool? Because it's unlike other, most other fish. What's your favourite animal? Oh, tardigrades. I know Oli has wanted social connections, but it doesn't come naturally for him. That comes down to his inability to understand another person's situation. In his world, it's very black and white. You have an argument, you have a debate. The emotional side doesn't come into it. Over the next few months, there were a few arguments. When backed into a corner, Oli will find that really hard to navigate, either backwards or forwards, and his natural instinct is to plough on through. Everyone should be able to have rational conversations. The problem is a lot of them take debate very personally. Oh, there was, like, the pro-life, pro-choice debate. Oh, yeah, we spoke about the wealth gap, systematic racism, sperm donors, authoritarianism, superficial gay culture... What do you want from them? To be honest, I just want them to accept me for who I am, erm, and to not feel that I'm being careless, just through being me. Erm, that's it, really, to be honest. The fact is the majority feeling towards me in the group is negative. I want to see if that can change. It's my family, so obviously it's important to me. OK, I'm just going, cos it's so hot, like, what will I really need? You're not going to be THAT hot. Yeah, I will. This was a whammy that I didn't see coming. Is that it? Yep. It's difficult to protect him from... from... Especially this scenario, because it's not just friends, it's siblings. There is this connection. If Oli didn't have Asperger's and I hadn't seen him struggle throughout all of his schooling years, I would hope that this would open up more doors, more friendships. With the way that it's gone so far, I don't really know what Oli will... how it will be, because there's so many unknown variables. Yeah, I'm dreading it. You have to take a step back, and just nod and go, "Isn't that lovely?", whereas, you know, your heart's kind of like, "Argh!" Go in cautiously, don't wear your heart on your sleeve and work out where you want to invest your time, and know that I'll be stalking you. I'm starting to realise we're actually going to the US. Man On Fire by Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros # I'm a man on fire # Walking through your street # With one guitar # And two dancing feet # Only one desire # That's left in me # I want the whole damn world # To come dance with me # Oh... # Come dance with me # Over murder and pain # Come set you free # Over heartache and shame... # Shoo! Shoo, shoo! I thought it was going to be warm. How's it going? Have you got warm enough clothes? No, I thought it would be, like, a tropical paradise, but it's freezing where I am. We're just at the Airbnb and we're planning to see Lindsay later tonight. All right, darling. Well, keep me posted. OK. I'll speak to you soon. I'm Lindsay. I am sibling number 20. So I would say Lindsay is one of the more sort of volatile siblings. She can be, like, the most empathetic and warm and fuzzy, but she can also be slightly scary. I just want to have the opportunity to have a one-on-one sort of relationship with her. All I know is I feel quite nervous. You just want these things to work out. Oh, my God! Hey! Hey. Oh, how are you? Good. How are you? Oh, I'm good, I'm good. I like this. Thank you. This is only, like, the second time you've been around any of us. It's weird, I don't usually think we, like, look a ton alike, but for some reason, I'm, like, looking at you and I'm seeing my face, and it's really weird. Ha-ha! Oh! I don't know if you're, like, having that experience, but, like, it's still that, like, you expect the craziness of it to get, like, less... It doesn't... like, the magnitude of the crazy to decrease over time, but it doesn't. Do some noises, like, really irritate you? Yeah. I hate chewing. Me too! Oh, my God. It's called misophonia. A couple of us have it, actually. It, like... It makes me want to die. Do you eat, like, lemons as well? Yeah, I'm one of the ones that eat lemons. I always eat the lemons. I peel them and I eat them like oranges. It's really interesting that all of us sort of individually came to the conclusion that, like, OK, we're going to try and make this a family, and it seems to kind of have worked, right? It's not going to be, like, 100% harmonious, but the fact that, like, so many people are in contact, and chat... Yeah, for sure. ..at all, is, like, just... Oh, oh, my God, that's... Oh, very nice. Thank you so much. The way I sort of describe it is just, like, you know, we're as dysfunctional as any other family, right? Yeah. Like, every family has its... its stuff, but I think it gives it character. Two years ago, Mom and I were talking, and I was, like, I just want to understand. I feel like there's this thing, and I don't know what it is, I can't identify what it is, but, like, I know it's there. She told me, "We had trouble conceiving you. "We had to do fertility treatments while your dad couldn't have kids, "so we chose to use a sperm donor." I actually went through, like, a couple of weeks where I, like, couldn't really look in mirrors. That transitioned into... And it's still a thing now, where, like, I just, like, can't stop staring at my face, cos it's, like, I finally understand where it comes from. Nobody in my family has curly hair like this. Nobody has green eyes that, like, all of us have. We've been siblings since the day we were born. I just didn't know them. Hi! I had all of these people that I, like, had to get to know, and I wanted to do it as fast as possible. Oh, my God, we're the same height! This is so weird! I know! Hi! Hi! We have the same eye colour. What the fuck? Do it. Go meet Kristen. It was so overwhelming and so emotional. Oh, my God! It's almost like primal recognition of something in each other, that, like, just transcends anything. Oh, my God! It's understandable that there might be more clashes, because the amount of us, and the newer siblings, like me, probably still have a lot more to learn. Yeah, there's definitely... there's definitely a learning curve. Yeah, I think so. I sort of think about it like it's a mirror. You can see the best parts and the worst parts of yourself reflected in other people in the group... Yeah, that's true. and, you know, like, you can either choose to, like, grow from that, or you can not, but, I reckon it's, like, the best growth opportunity that anybody could ever possibly ask for. I wasn't sure I'd be that excited, but then when I was actually sitting there, like, waiting, and then I, like, saw her, I all of a sudden got, like, er, like, an adrenaline spike. All I know is I feel like a fuzzy, warm feeling, erm... I think it went well. I like Lindsay. Do you think she likes you? I don't know. I think... I'm not sure, to be honest. I think Oliver can be incredibly sweet. Like, I like Oliver... most of the time. My thing with Oliver is I feel like I'm always so anxious about what he's going to say. It almost feels like walking on eggshells. I think he feels the same way about walking on eggshells. Probably. The problem is, these relationships, they're the most important thing, and they're delicate, and you have to be so careful. This is a very complex situation. It's complex people. It's a very fragile group dynamic and it is upset very easily. It's delicate. It's a delicate thing that we all choose to invest time and energy into. These are relationships that we have, like, nurtured to grow. So many of us are so socially aware. Obviously, Oliver having Asperger's, being, like, in that realm, that changes things. You need to get in the car, Ols. I know. All in good time. We haven't got good time! It's, like, 4:45, the flight's at six, and we've got to drop off the car. All in good time. Patience. Patience is a virtue, Will. Hi, I'm Brooklynn, and I'm sibling number 13. What do you see? It was always, like, something different about me that meant that I couldn't normally socialise with people. You're going to meet your uncle, Oliver. Why don't you get along with most people? To be honest, I don't know. I feel like perhaps I miss certain sort of, like, in the moment social cues, maybe. Oh, my God! Look! Can you say hi? Hello! Say hi, Uncle Oli! Oh, my God! How do you feel? Yeah, I don't know what... It's so adorable, babe. So cute! How are you, anyway? I'm good. I don't really know, like, what to say. That's OK! It's very cute! I grew up with a mom, a dad and then twin brother and sister, Spencer and Jordan. How's it going? Hey. Hello! Oh, my God! Nice to meet you! You are taller than I expected. Oh, yeah, they've never met. I don't know what I expected. I'm Jordan and I'm sibling number 14. I like this. Is that a scarf? Yeah, it is. Oh, it's really nice to see you again. You too. I am Spencer and I'm sibling number 15. I can cook really good, like, venison or steak, but that's not really relevant to a vegan. Excellent observation! Oli catches a ton of shit for things that he does, which are, erm, often times largely his fault. At the moment, the mood in regards to you is relatively negative, because of the... because of the text interaction. Reading messages from you, it is easy to be, like, "Oh, he's just being an asshole". On some level, in a group like this, you have to have some kind of filter if you don't want to be constantly... Yeah... arguing. And being considerate obviously goes a long way for your relationships. Yeah. People are actually concerned about you, to an extent. Some people, whenever they're talking about something that's maybe contentious, they try to make it very clear that they're trying to be sensitive to how other people feel about it... Mm. and I think people get upset with you because you're... you can just be more deadpan about it. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? For me, what has been repeated in the group a lot is impact over intentions, which doesn't make any sense, because the impact should also include someone's intentions, and actually understanding who they are and what they mean. He's atypical, socially, but it doesn't make it so that he's absolved of responsibility for, like, when he says stuff that upsets people, right? Like, the Asperger's adds context, but it doesn't excuse things to the degree that I think he might want them to. If he's acting like a dick, people will be like, "Yeah, I mean, I get that that's who you are, "but also, like, I'm just not interested." It sucks, because I'd really like to sort of just have, like, that opportunity just to sort of get to know people on, like, a more one-on-one basis. I'm not, like, the easiest person to have a relationship with for some people, and, like, I understand that, but, you know, it is still upsetting for me, sometimes, sort of having, sort of, like, the same issues, like, over and over. Erm... Yeah. I hope you know that, the three of us, we will always listen to how you're feeling and try to help and... Yeah... we know that we're not perfect, like, we can all get frustrated, too. But I do hope that you feel that you at least have some kind of support system, if you ever do need to talk about something. Mm, just, like, having three people, like, face-to-face, it's a lot less scary and unpredictable and, like, everyone's on the same page more, sort of, if that makes sense? Well, maybe not on the same page, but at least in the same boat. You know what I mean? Me and Brooklynn and Jordan, we've been so close for our whole lives. My dad had some substance abuse problems when we were really little and then lasted throughout most of my childhood from there on. I remember so many times, growing up, when I just was so hurt and appalled by the things that he would do that I would say, like, "You might be my father, but you're not my dad." And I meant that, and it must have hit him so much harder than I could have possibly imagined. Three years ago, sitting at home on the couch, watching TV, and my phone started ringing, and it was my dad, which was weird, because he does not call often. He called me and I thought we would just have a conversation, and he's like... "There's something that I've been wanting to tell you for a long time "and I just can't keep it a secret any more." He was crying and he said, "I'm not your real dad." I don't know, it's so crazy, like... it really felt like a movie moment. You've come to believe one thing your whole life. It was sort of this flood of realisation. Every conflict we had had before, this was something that was probably, like, this fact was running in the background for him. I immediately called my mom. She was just like, "I can't believe he told you". She had been, like, actively trying to keep this a secret forever. I think it's actually quite possible that a massive amount of our childhood trauma was rooted in the fact that they kept this a secret from us. I think it's a fear that a lot of parents have that maybe their kids will see them as less them, once they know that their genetics aren't the same. My parents, they were told the best thing for the child was to never tell them and pretend that everything was "normal". They say that the doctors told them not to. They were worried that I would feel different. The most important people in your early life have been lying to you about the very nature of your existence for your entire life. My eyes are unlike anyone's in my family. Last year, for Christmas, I bought myself a genetic test. I was hoping to find more about, you know, am I German, am I Irish? I had no clue that my dad wasn't my biological father. My cousin knew, my aunts and uncles knew, my grandma knew, my parents knew, my stepmother knew, my mum's fiancee knew. I was the only one who didn't know about my biology. My life has changed drastically. I went from being an only child to talking to one of my siblings now every single day. They've really been, like, the light and the silver lining to the negative that was this big secret of my whole life. Come over here, quickly. There's a, er, like, a hummingbird. Look how cute that is. How are you feeling after yesterday? I feel like it went a lot better than I thought it would. In person, like, I think it went really well, to be honest. Just, like, hanging out and doing nothing, like, those small things, I think, really matter a lot more than I thought they would. Of all of the siblings, Spencer's probably one of my top priorities in terms of who I want to have a relationship with. I mean, he's just very, very intelligent, very, very intellectually stimulating. I want to open a gateway to perhaps him thinking about wanting to have a closer relationship with me. These are my best friends. I've known them for so long. I told them about you a little bit. I was, like... I told them that you're British, but they're excited to meet you. You're actually the first of any of my half-siblings they've met before. Really?! Yeah, these are, like, my best friends, so... I'm honoured! Yeah. Hi! Hello. Hey. Nice to meet you. I'm Tyler. I'm Oli. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Cam. I'm one of his half-relatives. Yeah. Wonderful. Oh, my gosh! Hi. Buckskin Stallion Blues by Townes Van Zandt # I heard her sing in tongues of silver # I heard her cry on a summer storm # I loved her, but she did not know it... # Have you tried any, like, food places that you've really liked? Mm... I mean, no, not yet. We've been, like... OK. at really trashy, like, sort of drive-through places, like... OK. That's the American experience right there. # If three and four were seven only # Where would that leave one and two? # If love can be and still be lonely # Where does that leave me and you? # Time there was and time there will be # Where does that leave me and you? # Do you have your own bowling ball? Yeah. Yeah, he's had that since sixth grade. Interesting. You know, it's good, but then if I don't bowl for a long time and then I go bowl and I have, like, all this gear, and then I do absolute shit... I feel like, "Oh..." Posing? Yeah, like, "Oh, wow, nice!" On the one hand, Oli is so socially confident, but the funny thing about it is he never really has had, you know, a friend. # If I had a flyin' schooner # I'd sail into the light of day # If I had your love forever # Sail into the light of day. # He never makes very strong relationships with people. His relationships are transient. But now he's getting older, he wants to make his mark with friendships and have people who care about him. I find it really interesting how, like, temperature affects the sex of, like, baby turtles and tortoises and other reptiles. It does? Yeah, so, like, I can't remember which way it is, but depending on the temperature... Oli's looking for this Eureka connection, and I think having this perceived genetic links, he thinks that there's this shorthand and he feels that they're just going to go, "Bam! I get you." And this gets you a good view... It does actually. of the whole courtyard. Well, I enjoy having a one-on-one relationship with you, erm... I think you do piss people off, and I... I do piss people off! but like you're saying, I do... I do try to, like, stay objective about it. I get why people get upset with you. Sometimes I've been upset with you, but I think your personality meshes with mine. Like, the type of conversationalist I am, I could just go round and round about a subject for hours, and, like, not lose stamina about it. We do have, like, good debates and, like, conversations. Yeah, and, like, in that way, like, that's a personality trait that we share, that I'm glad we share. Yeah. How would you describe your sort of relationship with me, and, like, is it a sort of brotherly thing, is it like a more cousin-like... Yeah... relationship, or...? I am closer to you than I am to my cousins, and whenever I'm describing you to people, I describe you as my brother... Aw! because... because you ARE my brother, right? But, like, growing up with full siblings, I probably am... Like, I've already felt the connection of being full siblings or being siblings with someone before, so it's not as novel to me... Yeah. whereas for you, you're, like, meeting someone that's a sibling, and you're, like... Yeah, no, I do feel like I feel, like, closer to you than you feel to me. I think if you probably take some aspect of any relationship between two people and then you compare the feelings between two people, it's very unlikely that they're going to be exactly the same. So, if you ask me, do I think that we feel exactly as... I feel as close to you as you feel to me, er, like, probably not, right, because that's almost never the case. That's not me saying that... Yeah, I know. you like me and I'm done with you. Yeah, I know. I know. I think there's actually still a lot of room for us to get to know each other more. It's still something to grow into, right? Yeah. And we'll know each other for a long time, and you think about how much longer... I mean, we're still so young. There's a lot of time to grow into it, still. Mm. We've only known each other for... I mean, how long HAVE we known each other? Less than a year. I always have wanted, like, an older brother type figure, someone who can tell me off if I'm being inappropriate, or help me feel better about myself if I'm feeling a bit down, and to show that person that I care about them. But why an older BROTHER? Why not, like, an older sister... I don't know why. I never thought that I would care about the gender of anyone that... of any of the siblings, and I still feel close to a lot of the female siblings, but there's something about having an older brother specifically that makes me feel a certain way. I waited until I was about 45, which is a little late, and I went to the doctor to find out if I was in good physical shape, and she said I could have a child but my eggs were not viable, so I would need donors. On January 21st 1995... I had a boy, and I named him Sterling Alexander Knight, and he's grown up to be a wonderful young man. I used to be very close with Sterling. My name's Sterling, and I was the 16th sibling to be found. The first sibling I ever met in person. Hello. What's happening? We didn't really get, you know, a video. There's no-one else here, so... Yeah. Sterling came to England. Oh, God, it was amazing. And Oli was SO thrilled. I mean, that was the first time, probably, I'd seen him really express proper emotions. And Sterling was AMAZING with Oli. It was really strange for me to see, after, you know, my 20-year-old son for the first time having this massive connection with someone, and I think then, when Sterling flew out, I think that's when Oli just lost it. He cried and cried and cried and cried, and he had never... I don't know, felt something in that way before. Oh... I mean, what are the emotions that you're feeling? Like, why do YOU get emotional when you think of that? Because he's my son, and I've always wanted, like any mother, you want your child to, you know, have connections that are positive and rewarding and full of depth, where you really feel something for somebody, you know, and that's amazing. So, yeah. Oh, my God. We do have similar eyes, don't we? Which direction is it facing? You. Oh, OK. I would not have the camera this close to my double chin. All right, well... The fact that I had this big brother figure, you know, I felt so close to him, and it all sort of just went to shit, really. And what caused that turn? Erm, because I told him I was checking my eligibility to be a sperm donor. I think the big reason for this was because he has always struggled and been an outsider all of his life. Him being chosen by somebody as a sperm donor, for them to have their family, would be the ultimate acceptance for him. When I told some of the siblings, the way that they reacted was just... absolutely unreal. I was told that the idea of me donating is offensive because I have Asperger's. Why were you particularly upset with Sterling? Cos Sterling, you know, at the beginning, flew down to London to come and see me. What was it that turned it with Oli? Was it the sperm donation thing? I'm actually not sure if I want to get into that. He thinks I've lied about having Asperger's to the bank. Because I didn't tell them at the very beginning, he thought that that was an issue. The first test they do, they don't actually require you to fill out a form beforehand. They do the freeze test first, after that they then proceed to go through your medical history and so on. Of course, I would disclose all of my medical information. He phrased it as if I've put myself in this position and it's my fault. But what do you want from him? I want him to be my big brother again, and I want him to look out for me again. And I want to... And I want to show him that I care about him. You have reached the voicemail... Nope. I'm just wondering if everything was OK, you know? Oh, yeah, don't worry. I think that he needs a night of rest and he has to get through that migraine. Yeah. I don't know what he can actually do about it, because they last quite a while. Yeah. Ooh, that's him! Hello? Do you want, like, soup and painkillers, or... Let's do it properly. Let's just do it tomorrow when you're feeling a bit more bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. You have reached the voice mailbox of... He's now over an hour late. I'm going to call him on Skype. Has he said anything back? No. I've been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. He's on another call, apparently, and he's not messaged me to let me know he'll be late or anything like that. I miss my relationship with him that I had, and the time we spent in the UK was probably one of the most meaningful weeks of my entire life. I really enjoyed the relationship that he wanted to have with me... and he's just fucked me over. You OK? No. So, what's happening? I don't know. I don't even want to talk about it, to be honest. I'm just really pissed... I randomly bought three bags of, like, sandwiches and shit and was just dropping them off at random people, which is... felt like a big "fuck you" to Sterling. I don't know why! Um... Don't know. I'm done. I just don't... To be honest, I just want to get out and just go somewhere else. Hope they like it. What if I've gotten them, like, a flavour that they... like, a sandwich they really hate? Summer Sun by Cari Cari # Summer sun # Wash away the troubles # Summer sun # Like diamonds in the water # Let the rain # The lightning and the thunder # Ease my pain # And wash it all away # Summer sun... # April 1998. Um, my ex... That's what we wanted the sperm donor to look like. Must be handsome in a cute way and not with a big jaw. Oh, my God, who were we? Um... "Small nose, fine features, well-proportioned, similar to Brad Pitt, Rob Lowe... "No migraines or acne." Choosing the sperm became a minefield. You know, pages and pages of stuff to us. # Summer sun... # Eye colour, height, no photos. So my parents just went through and they found the people that sounded like my dad on paper and just, I think... put a finger down and said, "That one." # ..with your sunshine... # I still have the catalogue. Like, my mom kept it and she gave it to me. It, like, has pencil numbers on their top five choices, and I was like, "Hm, I wonder what I'd have been like if I'd been from donor number four." The vials are stored in these big tanks here and then we ship them in these little tanks. How old are these tanks? These tanks? This tank over here... is probably about 25 years old, maybe older. Oh, wow. Could have been the tank that I was in... Well... One of these older ones. ..half of me. Possibly! Not you... but a potential to be you. Here are the frozen vials. They're labelled with the number of the donor and the date that they were collected. What's the date on that? November 13, 2008. How long can you store it for? Pretty much indefinitely. We have a limit on the number of families per donor. We try to limit all of our donors to ten families. Was that the limit in Daley's case? My donor? Back then, we weren't as computerised as we are now... Right, yeah... so we do have a handful of donors who went over. We also have had some donors who are donors elsewhere. I think some donors weren't straightforward and didn't tell us that information and I think there were periods of our history where we didn't ask. Yeah, cos he went to a couple of sperm banks. Yeah. Since the record-keeping in the US, particularly in the '90s, for cryobanks was so-o-o-o atrocious... we don't have a definitive number of how many of us there are, especially because we're across two banks and, like, one bank had better record-keeping than the other. Because there are so many women and maybe five guys, six guys... Uh-huh. or something, we suspect we have at least, you know, another ten or something. Honestly, we might never know, just because there are, you know, families with mothers and fathers that never intend on telling their children. It breaks my heart, like, every day. And I think about it constantly that there are, like... siblings out there that I'm never going to know. Like, there are people out there walking around that are my brothers and sisters that I am never going to be allowed to know. And for, like, ethical reasons, we should be allowed to know who our siblings are. A couple people in our group went to high school together. Nobody wants to accidentally date their brother! We never did! I, like, typically don't date people who are, like, under 26 and then... Why? Cos then they could be a sibling. We would not have a sibling that's older than 26, just based on when Daley donated. So, Daley would have come in here? This is one of the collection rooms. So this is where Daley would have come. That is... remarkable. Yeah. Pardon the pun! Oh, my God! We have magazines, we also have Wi-Fi, so most of the donors bring their own "supplies". Right. Has that been there since the '90s? No. Oh, that's not bad-looking. How does it make you feel that your life kind of started with Daley in a small room? I mean, you didn't have to put it like that! You know, you don't have to put it that way! Golly, gosh, this is the one we chose! # When no-one else can understand me... # I had most of Daley's profile memorised as a kid cos my mom still had a hard copy and that was the only thing I had of his. # You give me hope and consolation... # But at that age I wasn't thinking of him as a singular, tangible person. He was just kind of this... like, abstract figure, this father... A general gut feeling of loss or getting sad on Father's Day cos everyone else had a dad and I didn't. # That's the wonder # The wonder of you... # Your donor had originally participated as an anonymous donor and he changed his mind. And so, when we have a donor who says he wants to change his mind, then we reach out to the families and we let them know. Spencer and I both had a lot going on at the time and we were just like, "Well, we'll get to it later." I was working at a restaurant and I started to notice... I would be serving a table and there would be a man in his mid-40s and I would kind of like stare at him a little extra. And I didn't even realise I was doing it for a while, and then I was like, "OK, maybe I really do want to know who this is." I don't want to have to wonder forever if every random guy that passes me on the street might actually be my dad. # Your love for me is everything... # So we met up with him for the first time with my mom, cos I was like, "I cannot do this by myself. "I need you by my side." She said, "Yeah, of course." # You love me as... # Taking that next step, actually seeing him face-to-face, it felt like my whole life had been leading up to this. OK. # The wonder of you. # My name's Daley and I am part of a very special family situation. There was a clinic down the street. Some attractive young woman was, like, strolling by and she knew what the clinic was and saw me walking in and just gave me a wink and said, "I hear they give out free cookies." Like... I had this choice - either be an anonymous donor or an identity-released donor. Being at that age, I said anonymous. What made you change your mind? McKenzie looked me up, went through the bank. They said, "Oh, this person's anonymous, but we'll reach out "and ask him anyway." There was really no question. How could I deny her that information? I called the two banks and had them change me from anonymous to identity release. When this whole thing started, I was aware that there were four. Four seemed like a big number, but manageable. And then it was six. Then it was eight, then it was ten. And then it would get bigger. What does that feel like? You meet them as adults, and you're their dad? How did those first meetings go? I was shaking, thinking about meeting him. I just got off, like, a 13-hour shift, I was, like, all sweaty. On the one hand, I didn't want to be too familiar. Daley is not a parental figure to me and he's not really a paternal figure to me. "Who is this guy? Why is he being so presumptuous? "This is not my dad - he didn't raise me." I honestly think that if he never came forward or we never found him, I don't think I would have thought twice about it. I also didn't want to be too distant and have them feel like, "Why doesn't he want to know me?" or, "Why doesn't he want "to be connected to me? Is he ashamed he of me?" or something. I was just kind of in awe for, like, the first hour and... but just, like... the pure joy. He was wearing sunglasses, actually, when I met him. And then when he took off his sunglasses, it really hit me and I was like, "Those are my eyes!" I mean, I guess, technically, my eyes are his eyes. Is it possible to have a relationship with 26 kids? Of course it is. # We belong to something new. # You know, a lot of people have this experience when they have kids, when they have children, right? You have a newborn baby and you look at this baby and you're so overwhelmed with love, it's just this bottomless pit of all of your positive emotions and you can't imagine sharing it with anyone else. And then you have another and you realise, you know, your heart just cracks up and it gets bigger. What about Oli? Uh, Oli, I've really enjoyed meeting Oli. Oli, I think, has, I would say, among all of those that have wanted to come into the group and kind of get acclimated and... get into the... group dynamic, I think he's struggled probably the most. So, how are you feeling about seeing Daley again? I mean, it's complicated. The first time I met him, we just didn't connect. Jesus Christ. Why does he have to live up a hill? He says, "Oli, you don't understand still, you need to learn the tools "of life to get along with people." Essentially, what he means by that is, "You don't have the right to be yourself." And that's quite hurtful. I've tried to give some advice here and there about how to navigate. I'm not sure he's 100% receptive to advice. Oliver and I have had some spirited conversations. I see my relationship with him as having room for lots of growth. What would you say, specifically, you connect with me on? We have... You know, I think there's a lot of family traits. That... you know, verbal acuity. There's a lot of no dummies in the... in the group, right? Yeah. Anything unique to you and me? I don't know, Oliver. I feel like our ability to get to know one another's been, you know, it's been in fits and starts. Yeah. As we've, let's be honest... I've had... we've had our struggles in the way some of the group interactions have gone and... Mm-hm. How do I figure in your life these days? I do feel, like, a closeness to you. And I do want a healthy relationship, but... sometimes it feels like I'm not sort of... Like I'm sort of insufficient. No, you've told me that before. I know. It's not true. It's not about that. Mm-hm. And, I mean, I have tried to help you, side-message you in the middle of these conversations where things seem like they're going off the rails and I recognise that you may not fully understand why people are reacting the way they are. Like, I mean, I'm... I'm trying, you know? So, for me, that comes across as I'm insufficient. Growing up, I had that constant message that I wasn't behaving the way that people needed me to, and that sort of just drilled the message in my head that I'm just not... I'm not normal and I'm not good enough. It's contextual. It's, like, a skill and judgment. And these are people who I know better than you do, cos I've known them for a long time. And you came into the group with a whole bunch of women, a lot of them are... have been in this space for a long time and... Mm-hm... are comfortable talking about certain things. And you came in and started using the word "bitch". To describe a celebrity as a bitch. To just use the word, right? Right. And... Because I'm a guy? ..it created... No, for anyone. The girls use it several times... And it created... This is exactly what I'm talking about - you're turning it into identity politics and a political and a, like, rational... And you want to talk about it in those terms. That's not what it is. It's just about respect. No, but the girls use it. It's not about that. This is rehashing one of the very first fights that caused a lot of alienation. And I'm telling you again, it was about respect. So, I can't use a certain word because people have a trauma response when a man uses it? For me, it's very much more about intentions. It's about how... It's about knowing people and it's about knowing their intentions... Years ago, before he was diagnosed with Asperger's, I thought, "Well, maybe I'm not strict enough, maybe I was...", you know. So I spent a year shouting at him, you know... So you think you have more entitlement to disrespect people that you know? It's not disrespect. For people who really know me, I just want to be myself. You're asking the entire world to accommodate just you. Oh, no, I'm not. So, what... is it? You can never really get through to Oli because he'll be thinking exactly what he thinks and he won't be able to... see someone else's point of view. You can't parent an Asperger's child, you're there to just buffer them throughout life. Any parent, if a third party came into the picture, a strange man, who you made a decision about 20 years ago, then pops up and has an influence over your child's life, that's a difficult pill to swallow, isn't it? Cos Daley's Oli's dad. He's not. To me, a dad is someone who has been there, kicked a ball, played a part. A donor is something that is a donation. It's not a role. I don't know. It makes me wonder if there's a way that we... could have a better relationship. If it was more just the two of us, not in the context of this other family group, because I'm defensive for everyone. It'd be nice to have a scenario where it would be just us, sort of, in our mutual habitats. You know? In the most unpleasant of exchanges, I've said the same thing, right? Like, I'm not going to write you off. I mean, he's not my dad because he didn't raise me. I think there's potential for another type of relationship, like a more uncle-type relationship... but he can't open his mind to the fact that, perhaps, I'm quite a different person to most people. I think he sort of wants me to... mould myself and to be someone I'm not. It's actually very sad for me because it means that it's almost impossible for me to actually have a close relationship with him. Ladies and gentlemen, if we could have your attention one more time, we'd like to announce... our home of LA. This is a city where dreams become reality, so no matter what your story is or where your dreams may take you, there's a place in Los Angeles just for you. Well, the meet-up, for me... You know, it's my family, so obviously it's... it's important to me, but... I don't want to get my expectations up. Occasionally, when people, sort of, get to the real me, they really like it, but more often than not they don't like it. And, like, I get... end up being rejected. So... it is quite sort of scary. Um... I always think, going into a relationship, "Am I going to do or say something?" Or "Are they going to get to know me better "and then back off and reject me?" I don't know. There's just been such a consistent pattern of a lot of people rejecting me. What if they're just hanging out and they just don't want me there? Like, what if they don't want me? Oh! Hello! Hey! Oh, my gosh, you look amazing! Hey, what's up? You guys look fantastic. Riding in style. Oh, my God! Oliver! Melissa, hey! This is like the perfect setting for a murder mystery. I need this fire going ASAP. Whoa, Jesus! Fucking hell! Why did you turn it off?! # Holiday, oh, a holiday And the best one of the year... # Oh, my gosh! I didn't even think they were coming! Oh, my gosh! Yeah! Hello! Hello, again. Yes! Yes! You're getting owned by your little brother. Humiliating, Spencer. Oh! Hello! The siblings that I'm related to, that I have these really close relationships to, I chose to have really close relationships to. I didn't... It wasn't forced upon me because we're blood-related. Who looks...? Who do...? Like, the three of us... I think you guys look so much alike. Yeah? One of the things that irritates me, someone will be like, "Oh, I like spicy food." And then someone else will be like, "Oh, my God, "I like spicy food, too. We're so related! But I'm like, "No, you just both fucking like spicy food." Like... Kelly, I haven't talked about boy things. Lay it on me. That's my favourite conversation. I mean, it's amazing that we've all been brought together by biology, but at the same time... you know, I am going to bond more and hang out more with people that I actually have things in common with. Asking the important questions! It's kind of like two and a half maybe. I'm going to pop inside for water or something. OK! Cool! Wait, so you saw Emily and Hannah? Yeah. Today? Kind of. Are they coming? Yeah, they're coming. Doing all right? Anxious, uh... Yeah. I've always managed Oli's life in a way where I know what he can cope with and when he can't. Where's the loo here? It's like... A doctor did say to me years and years ago that Oli will... that the Asperger's will definitely show up in emotional states. Anxious. And I need something to take the edge off. Oh, it's been nine hours. Hey! How are you? Good, how are you? I'm going to, like, dish out the rest of these hugs. Hey! Fuck's sake. I love it so much. Oh, my God! Knock, knock! Hi! Hey. Hello! I didn't know that Jordan and Sterling hadn't met until, like, five minutes ago. Like, it just hasn't happened! It's like you actually exist now! I know! Oh, my gosh! Look at you, you're a real human being! From a social setting... it all comes down to his inability to process what's going on around him. And in a heightened emotional situation where there's 26 other people, all with their backstories, all with their feeling, for Oliver, it's like putting him into a minefield. There is no way that Oliver can navigate a situation like that. Just never going to happen. What is happening, Oli? Oli, what's happening? I can make one wrong move, say one wrong thing and then I'm fucked and then everyone's pissed off with me, so I don't... But is that true? Yes, unfortunately. I wish it wasn't. Should we just try it? No. It's not something I can just get into. I'm not in the headspace. I just... I'm too anxious. I just need to... So fucking stressed, honestly. I get you. Honestly, I think you're probably overthinking it to a degree. A lot of the time, like in the group chat where you feel like you need to watch what you're saying, it's when the content of conversations is, like, particularly heavy or, like, political or something about ethics or something like that, right? But, you know, as of right now, since everything is, like, particularly light-hearted, I don't think there's anything you could say. I didn't realise I'd be this anxious. I hope I'm not leaning on you too much and just being annoying and... No... sort of emotionally draining. No, no. I mean, I don't want you going through this whole thing feeling like you're drowning and you have no-one to talk to about it. You know? I want to talk to you about it. I don't want you to feel like you can't talk to me cos you're annoying me or anything, because that's not the case. So, yeah, just focus on the positivity with all the cool people here who you... You know. OK. People have different views about whether or not you owe someone, like, your time, based only on the fact that they're related to you. But I feel like there is a ton of potential for really deep friendships by virtue of the fact that we are family. Oli, he started getting really close with Sterling. Sterling went and visited him in London. I suggest to Oli all the time that he should try and mend their relationship. I think he would benefit from it a lot. I was waiting outside of your house. Then I stay in the hotel the next day, and I'm waiting for you for hours. You're online. You're having conversations with people, ignoring me, ignoring my messages, my calls, and not turning up for three hours. I... That was so hurtful. I had such a close relationship to you, and then it really fucking affected me, Sterling. I see that you're hurt, and I understand that. You fucking hurt me. Oliver, let me talk. No, you don't care, though! You think that you're the victim... I do care. I'm trying to talk to you about this, and you're not letting me. I have a right to be angry with you after all your shit, Sterling. You have the right to be angry, but I also have the right to explain why I think I distanced myself from you. You did something that hurt a lot of people in this group, talking about the donation thing. Tested my own fertility... And that... because I'm thinking about potentially, later down the line, becoming a donor. But you know that you can't. Why? Because you have Asperger's. Why can't you just fucking accept me for me?! Because you don't seem to... What's wrong with me, Sterling? Like, I didn't fucking get it! Because you don't seem to care. But you've pissed me off sometimes and I'm happy that you have the freedom to be you. I don't want to edit you or change you. Do you know how many times you've hurt me and I've just eaten it because I've tried to let you just be you? I don't want you to be hurt. I know that you feel you've had to budge your entire life. You've had to shift and move farther and farther away from who you feel you are. But you and your identity is not your behaviour. You don't seem to accept responsibility for your actions. You don't believe what other people say, as you think that others' reactions aren't reasonable. A lot of them aren't. They are, though, because that's what they feel. I genuinely just don't show affection in the way that you want me to, Sterling. I... It's just not natural to me. I... I don't know what you want from me. At this point, I don't... I don't know either. I... I know... I know you look up to me as a big brother type. What I imagine, and I can't speak for you, but what I imagine it looks like is that you were given this wonderful opportunity of all these people that, in a way, like, you can't change blood. In a way that these people should just love me or should accept me automatically, and it's been really challenging. I just want us to be as open with each other as possible. I think we should move forward. But because of the way you spoke to me about the fertility thing, I still think I'm going to be hurt for a while. I get that. And you know that I... I'm sorry. I honestly can't. I don't know why that one thing is such a point of contention. I really don't. His Master's Voice by Monsters of Folk # Mohammed rolling dice with Christ at twilight # And they hear their master's voice # They run to do their chores # At Master's calling... # You know what, I've been in this for a few years and it took me probably at least a full year to be able to move past a little bit of the pain I think that I felt when it wasn't maybe what I expected going into it initially. Even though we are related, this is a random sample of strangers. The connection comes from the fact that we are in a very unique situation. The bond that we might feel with the other people in this group doesn't have to be because we're family. Genetics is sort of just the door to relationships with people, and you don't necessarily have to go through it, right? That is a very good way of putting it. Yeah? I have come to such a peaceful spot with the place that I have in this group, even though it is distance, not even necessarily age... I think that might be the right sort of path for me as well, to be honest. There's so much to be gained. My best friends are in that room. Yeah. You know? I don't know who you have interacted with a lot or a little, but maybe the people you've hardly talked to at all are going to end up being the most important relationships you've had. It evolves with time and there are going to be always more people coming in this group. We're never even going to know if we've found everyone, so the minute you think that you maybe have got it, it might change again. Coming in new and having just found out... Sorry, I'm so nervous. Am I ever going to be 100% ready? In a way, like, so much is about to change. Like, a lifetime of connections is starting now. Hi! New people, hi! Yes! Wait, do you know who I am? Um, I know it. It's Sterling. It's nice to meet you, finally, officially. Who is this? I literally don't know who this person is. Is she related to me? Hey! Alysse? Yeah. I'm so happy to meet you! And you have the eyes as well. Mm-mm! Hi! Hi! It's great to meet you. Sorry, this is a lot. All of them and me, too. Yeah. I mean, welcome to the circus. It's funny, I was asked the other day, "Well, you must just mix them up all the time because there's so many. Like, confuse who lives where and..." I was like, "No, actually, not at all." This kind of information sticks on a totally different level. It's not in the same league as friends or acquaintances. They are family ties. I've been following her on Facebook. Pretty intently. This is something that doesn't go away. We're genetically related. Oh, yeah, baby smell! They're family to me. That's how I engage with them. That's how I treat them. That's how I feel about them. Are you going to try and go up further? Yeah, just one more. So silly. I don't know how Hannah is higher than Spencer. Why? Because I'm a girl! You got up there so fast! We're going to need to talk about feminism! Aw, there's a family tree metaphor in there somewhere. You just have to sit, like, at the bottom. That's right. That'd be really funny. Can we make that happen? I will. I'll come stand underneath it to get a quick picture. Sterling, can you help wrangle him for a second, so he doesn't...? Hey, Oliver! Oliver. Will you take a picture? Yeah. Can you please not kill yourselves? Are you getting Daley in it, too? No, I think the idea is to come down here. I'm going to do him as well. No, but to get all of us in the shot, cos it's a family tree metaphor. Oh, right, OK, I got it! Say 26 of us have two kids. That's 50 kids, plus 20 sets, like a 75-person family reunion. Do you think I'll break this if I try to walk down on it? The family tree will become so extensive, like our kids' kids' kids in the future, like, if they want to get into genealogy, it's going to be a mess. It's going to be a mess for them. Like... As people start having kids and stuff and getting married, like, when people continue to be there through, like, these huge life events, I think that it's just going to make us closer. I don't know how I'm going to handle bridesmaids, because I can't include everyone. But where do I cut it off? Once we all have kids, if we want to do this, like, we're going to have to, like, rent out a whole summer camp and, like, everyone will be in cabins, we're going to have, like, activities scheduled. Unpopular opinion. I'm not getting all these kids birthday presents. I'm sorry. There's too many of you. No, I'm not even going to remember their names. I don't even remember all my half-siblings' names! Every once in a while I, like, stop and, like, sit back and think how, like, truly... amazing everything is. Like, how the last ten years... Like, what would my life be like if I hadn't found siblings? I just... They're always going to be there. Like, I have no sense of rush. And no-one's going to judge anyone for how fast or slow they feel like going. Well, OK, so you're orangey, and then Carolyn's going to be over there. Maybe, like... Well, Oli's 20. I'm 22. You know, in ten years we'll be in our early thirties. There's still so much time. I care about Oli, and I want for him to be happy, and I want what's best for him. And I'm going to stick around, right? OK. Everyone, here we go. Let's do it! Tree, two, one. Smile! One, two, three, Sperm Man! Right up into your face! I'm not in the photo. Yeah, we're not in this photo at all. Yeah. I mean, it's over now. I'm so grateful for the fact that I even have one relationship with a sibling. The idea that I could have, like, four or five is just insane, and I'm going to pursue one-on-one relationships, but I can't be involved in the group dynamic again. It's too stressful for me. Are you going to change, Ols? What would I change into? What would I do? What will I change into? What is there for me to change into? Tell me. The answer is that I can't expect people to see me a certain way. I can't expect everyone to see me for me. I can't expect everyone to not require that I behave like a different person. I can't expect that from people. I think just through me being me, there are people that won't like me... and I think that's OK.
