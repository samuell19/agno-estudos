In the year 1763 king Mangra ascended to the throne of Burma. His first goal was to conquer the small surrounding town states. But the city Ayudhya in Siam relieved these town states - - and encouraged them to to fight back. Therefore king Mangra decided to attack Ayudhya, the heart of Siam. In 1765 the king dispacthed a great army - - to attack Ayudhya by two different routes. Commander Mang-Maha-Noratha lead 100.000 men in from the the West. Another 100.000 came down from the North lead by commander Nemeao, - - but these didn't reach the destination as scheduled. They were forced back near a little village. Waves af burmese soldiers attacked the inhabitants of the village. Despite the superior strength of the army the farmers forced it back again and again. Rumours about the legendary courage of siamese country people - - spread fast across the whole nation. This is their story. The year 1765 Are you sure, Po Tan? Will the burmese come this way? What are you afraid of? We defeat them every single time. We will defeats them this time as well. Wait for me here. You follow with me. Kill them, all as one! Follow me. The Commander has been wounded! Retreat! Retreat! Retreat! Here is some food. Po Tan... A burmese battalion has put up a camp in the woods. Hurry up and eat. The commander is wounded. Do we call it off? Commander, sir! THE VILLAGE BANG RAJAN Chorb! Ming! Call for the abbot in a hurry! My god... I need help just to stand up straight. Don't say that. Bang Rajan is not strong enough, when it's leader is wounded. The village need to find a strong man, that can replace me. I know the right man. He harbours a bitter hatred towards the burmese. He doesn't fear death. He come from the village Khao Nang Buad. Who's there? Show your face! You are not burmese. Don't you know, it's lethal to be out here? We come from Bang Rajan. We are looking for Ai Jan Nuad Kiew. What do you want with me? We want to make you our leader. Look here. There are wagon tracks. And so what? Look, how deep they are. It is burmese chariots. They carry canons to Ayudhya by the river of Prasop. Your village keeps growing. I fear, that one day the burmese point the canons at you. THE BATTLE BY THE RIVER OF PRASOP Ai Jan's mustache is the same size the horns of this buffalo. And he is almost as smart as a buffolo. His reputation is totally exaggerated. But people here in the village blindly trusts, what is new. When they see a shit in the field, they think, it is gold. - Of all my heart I'm happy to see you. - We are pleased to be here. These strips of clothing were blessed by the abbot. They bring luck. - I would like to talk to the abbot. - Me too. We meet at Po Tan's house. Come with me. What can I do - - make them show a little respect? You are pissed(drunk)! - How goes it, Ai Jan? - I'm ready, Holy man. I never thought, you would leave Khao Nang Buad. I asked you to follow us into the jungle, but you refused. Live in the jungle? What about the children of the village? Was I supposed to just leave them? Is the temple here as good as the one in Khao Nang Buad? My job is to preach and teach. That is enough for me. How are you, Holy man? I'm fine. And you, little disciple? It is wartime, but i am neither wounded nor sick. - Who has made you a monk? - The Abbot has given me holy orders. You have been gone for so long. We didn't knew what happened to you. The Abbot said, I could help you by doing good deeds. You are blessed. Your Mother would have been proud of you. May she rest in piece. Po Tan, this is Ai Jan. Po Tan, you didn't had to come. I would have visited you later. Ai Jan, I need to tell you something, - - and the whole village has to hear it. The Abbot told me, that you are a remarkable warrior. The village needs skilled men, - - especially now, because i'm wounded. Unfortunately we have to face, - - that the village is without a strong leader. A leader and commander. Ai Jan, Will you be the leader of Bang Rajan? We are just normal warriors. But if you think, that I'm worthy, I will not refuse. You decide, how the guards must placed. Here is the town wall weakest. The watercourse is a wall in itself. Not one single time has the burmese succeeded getting through here. It is difficult to send an army through. That man is a great warrior, even though he is drunk. He always return from the battlefield dressed in burmese armour. Carry him back. How do you feel about Ai Jan started living in the jungle? Isn't he worried about his wife and children? Or have they already been killed? Why are you so so interested in Ai Jan? In here it's only you and me. And you are far more interesting than the others. Bua! My Bua! I have seen traces of the burmese canons. I have spoken to Po Tan about that. We should have canons as well. I have written a request for weapons. It has to be delievered in Ayudhya. AYUDHYA Wait here. They are coming! How much longer do we need to wait? - Grab some food. - Thanks. Most people leave their villages and take refuge here. But I insisted in fighting back the burmese. What are you made of, You folks from Bang Rajan? We are not from Bang Rajan. We origin from Ban Sri Bua Thong. We cultivated the land and went hunting. We lived a quiet peaceful life. If you concentrate, you will not get hurt. No blood can be spilled at an ordination ceremony. Hurry and clean it up. What's with you? You have acted weird lately. What keeps E Taeng Aon? I will let go of you, when your grandma has heard about this. Let him go, E Taeng Aon. You rip his ear off. That's what I call a big pig. It was Ai In, who shot it, right? No, it was Ai Muang. Actually it's not that big. There is hardly food for one person. You are not so big a hunter, eh, Ai Muang? Just say it. It wasn't you, who killed the pig, was it? Well, don't you have anything to say? Or have you forgotten to clean teeth? You can say whatever you like. But some day it will be my sword, which protects you. It is Som! Hey, Som. Are you on leave? No, I deserted. I came to participate in the ordination of my son. But don't tell my mother. She will get so nervous. Juk! Juk, Your father has returned! No, don't do it! Watch out, Ai Muang! The people in Bang Rajan invited the survivors - - to join them and live in their village. We united in our hatred towards the burmese. We became more and more every day. We knew, we couldn't run away. Together we would fight back the burmese. It was here I became acquainted with a drunk - - by the name Ai Tong Maen. Even the monks raised weapons. Soon the town's temple was empty. We better take a look in the temple. You can't kill him! I beg you you to spare his life for my sake. But he is burmese. Aren't they humans as well? They feel the same pain as we do. I can't ignore your command. Where are you from? From Bang Rajan. We want to offer you the post as our spiritual leader And so the monk Dhammachote started living in Bang Rajan. In him the warriors found will, motivation and inspiration - - to win every battle. Do you wear the blessed clothing, every time you fight? What can I do to get such a talisman? You have been extremely kind, and we have nothing to offer in contrast. We are happy to give you our clothing You really want to give them to us? Is there found a decision? May you live a long life. Next time you sacrifice, spare a little for yourself. How is your son doing? He is dead. That's why I brought food as offer. So he wouldn't starve in the next life. Po Tan, can you sharpen my sword? Of cause. just a moment. Who's the owner of this axe? It's enormous. It belongs to Ai Tong Maen. I can't barely lift it. Ai Tong Maen, the drunk. WHat kind of person is he? I have asked myself that a lot of times. I still no nothing. I only know, that he arrived lying on a wagon pissed. And he has not been sober since. Ai Tong Maen, here are your axes. You are a skilled warrior. Why don't you teach the others your technic? I'm not a teacher. And besides we all have to die anyway. You talk as ugly, as you smell. What did you say? If you drink yourself to death, - - what good are you, when the burmese attack? Ai Jan! They have returned from Ayudhya. Ayudhya didn't give us any canons. They don't want to help us. They fear, that if Bang Rajan falls, - - the burmese will just have more canons. You did your best. It looks like, we are alone... ... more than before. I suggest, that we build outposts in the trees - - and have them guarded all time. It will be like expanding the wall. That makes us a little ahead. It's a stupid idea. Why should we wait? It is better to attack them - - than to sit around and wait for them. I agree! I have no idea, what you talk about. If we do this... ... we improve safety in the village. Hopefully you understand that. Let me take the next watch. Ai In, you get killed! I will not stay her! Let go of me! Let go! It's me, Ai In. I am still alive. Take it easy. But soon you will die. My family can't die here! We are leaving! The Burmese are on their way! Hurry up, E Taeng Aon! This is the abbot's medicine. Rub it over the wound. Don't worry, Mali. For several days he has talked about going to Ayudhya. If he does it, I have to go with him. I can't let him down. Open the gate! Is it you, Ai Jan? Come inside and get a little to eat and drink. Did I wake you up? Some nights I can't sleep. In nights I have also been standing guard, - - like you do now. Ai Jan... The day, you talked about asking for canons from Ayudhya... ... I felt, that you were a strong and powerful leader. I even dreamt about firing the canons myself against those damn burmese. If we just had those canons. Everything would be easier. I think, I have to be more strict towards the others. What do you think? I have pointed you out as leader. You must do, what you find wisest. Stop! Here are some blankets for the journey. Safe travel, Mali og Ai Plang. Your son will have grown big before next time we meet. - Thanks. You are good friends to have. - Good luck. E Taeng Aon... You scarred me. Why do you follow me? - Promise not to say anything. - I promise. You must teach how to fight. You said I was useless with a sword. Have you changed your mind? Will you teach me or not? First you have to ask polite. "Please?" Please? Please? Ih, It makes my flesh crawl. I don't want to learn anyway. Your wrists are to thin. Your hands are soft as a baby. You are to weak to handle a sword. Stop being so patronizing. I was kidding. I just wanted to say, I think, you are beautiful. Way to beautiful to run around killing people. I will protect you from the burmese. I won't let them do you any harm. I will protect you with my life. Can I go now. I meant, what I said. - Where're you going? - Home. It is also my house. Big jerk! Why do you come here in this hour of the night? We would like to have a relic, that can protect us in battle. I don't have such a thing. Relics exist only in your imagination. Can we have the clothing, you are sitting on? Ai Tong Maen. You are pissed all day long. Take this. It's from the abbot. It will bring us good luck. It protects you from the enemy and your own recklessness. Tie it around your arm, like Ai Jan does. Then no weapon can harm you. You idiot! What did you do that for? You were right. You didn't got injured, You just got a bump. You idiot. You should rather steal armour from the burmese. I have seen thousind of men wearing that strip and they were dead. Can you see those bananapalms? We pretend they are the burmese. What the hell are you doing? You destroy the bananapalms. I want to be able to take care of myself whatever might happen. I want to survive. Do you really know how to fight? Of cause. I've watched the men training. You think, that's enough to be good? Get back to the kitchen. I am hungry. What do you say, my friend? There is plenty of food for everybody. - But it won't last forever. - We need to fill the storehouses. I overheard a conversation between the people from Ban Krab. They said, that when they had to escape, their rice was almost ready to harvest. By now it should be ready to harvest. You watch the reaping. We ride out and stand guard. E Sa, you are tired. You need to rest. What's wrong, E Sa? Are you pregnant? Have you told your husband? Not yet. I don't want to end up like Mali. I couldn't bear that. - Where is my wife? - She suffered a slight indisposition. Ai In doesn't need to worry about me. Ai Muang said, you felt unwell. Or are you lazy? You just wanted to chat with E Taeng Aon? You wife doesn't feel well, and then you talk to her like that. Rest for a while. I will harvest for you. - Then I can harvest for you. - Ai Muang! Ai Tong Maen? What are you doing? Jeg kind of got lost, but I managed to find my way. - How did you get here? - We have followed you. Ai Jan, where have you been? I have seen the burmese. They have captured prisoners. Where? How many? Around 30 soldiers. They have taken 20 prisoners. They are on their way through the nearby field. What do we do? We are not done harvesting. We wait, 'till they reach the hill. I give the sign. Kill all of them. If we don't do that, we will not be able to finish reaping. Ai In, take position at the hill. You go that way. The rest of you come with me. What the hell are you doing? Get going! Wait for the sign. - I can't go any further... - Get up! Come on! Fire! Look what you have done Ai Tong Maen! Ee is dead! Grab Ai Tong Maen and lock him up. Are you angry with Ai Jan because he locked up Ai Tong Maen? I see it from both sides. To me there is only one enemy and that's the burmese. THE BURMESE CAMP BY WISETCHAICHAN COMMANDER MANG-CHANGAI E Taeng Aon? Why are you awake at this hour? I need to tell you something, Ai In. I didn't want to wake you up. Go back to sleep. I am awake anyway. Let me get you some water. You don't need to do that. I can do it myself. But I always do it for you. From now on you never have to do that sort of things. You don't need to get water. You don't have to harvest rice. I will take over all your duties. Then the others will say, that I don't take good care of my husband E Taeng Aon has told me everything. It has made everything clear to me. I am unbelievable happy. If it's a boy, I will have him ordained. Why didn't you tell me? You are not surposed to keep secrets from your husband. It was just a joke. Don't get upset. E Sa... Why are you crying? Is there anything else you haven't told? I saw Mali and her little child. Her husband worried so much, that he got injured in battle. It must not happen to you. You may not die from me... Go back to sleep. We can learn something from Mali. What happend to them won't happen to us. Never. Now I understand, what it was Ai Tong Maen meant. We can't wait for the burmese. we have to retaliate. Last time I stood guard, - - I saw some burmesiske deserters sail down the stream. It just came to me, we ought to attack them from the riverside. If everybody agrees, Let's do it. But who will be on guard then? - You stand guard, Sing. - Why me? We can't all go. Somebody has to stay back home. You stay as well, Ai Muang. Stay and protect the village. No I want to go. It's not doable. Ai Jan will discover if too many of us are missing. Let us get going. Tonight we give a burmese commander a columbian necktie! - Where are you going? - We are fugitives heading for Bang Rajan. - Is this the right way? - Just continue straight ahead. Wait! Wait! What's in the back of you wagons? Don't let him escape! Kill them! Get back! Noone must escape! Ai Jan, let me out! Ai In? Ai In? Ai Jan, let me out! Hurry inside. Let me out! Close the gate! E Taeng Aon! It was you who stood guard. How could the burmese get inside? Why do you blame Ai In? You can see he is wounded. Enough, Ai Muang. It's my fault. I left my post. Myself and some men went to their camp to kill their commander. My actions are unforgivable. Punish me as it suits you. Decapitate him! He deserves to die! I can't allow that. Ai In did what he felt was right. Han put his own life in danger in order to kill their commander! How many of you are brave enough to do that? Ai In, You know you acted wrong. Don't let it happen again. Look what we have been exposed to! And you let him off with a warning? Then decapitate him yourself. My son is dead becasue of you! E Sa! E Sa! E Sa! It was wrong of me to leave you. It was wrong of me to leave my post. It was wrong of me to lead my friends to their death. I swear - - I will make it up for all my actions. The Burmese have conquered everything with exceptance of Ayudhya. Will Ayudhya help? If not, we have to surrender to the burmese. It's better to be slave than to be dead. I have never seen you up here before. There is something I want to say. All the inhabitants are running. Women, children... everybody. They take what's possible and run. Ai Tong Maen, why did you decide to come here? It was not a choice. I was drunk and fell asleep on a wagon. When I woke up I was here. Sometimes I wish I were like you. Without a responsebility. I ought to move back to the jungle. Then I wouldn't have the responsebility for other peoples lives. Ai Jan... What I wanted to say was that you have done everything you could. Those of us who are left know it's a matter of life and death. We don't know when we are going to die. We only know what is happening rigth now. In the past I thought the only one to look after me was my father. But then I saw you put your life in danger to save me. Now I know that you care about me too. When I came to Bang Rajan I often went down here. So I sat here... ... and thought about starting family. Maybe begin to farm. E Taeng Aon, would you like to live together with me? Can you protect your family with that tiny bow, Ai In? It's for our son. How old must he be before he can play with it? One day I will learn him how to use it, so he can protect you. Po Tan, you ought to go to Ayudhya, while you still can. I am going nowhere. Look at my wounds. I would die before I came anywhere. Do you think I could be any use if I stay? A lot of the inhabitants have already packed their things and left. We are almost no warriors left. What is your plan Ai Jan? Ayudhya wouldn't help, so I came instead. Jeg bring drawings with me so you can build your own canons. We don't have metal enough. Unload the armour! Fire! THE BURMESE CAMP BY THE PRASOP-RIVER COMMANDER NEMEAO GENERALE OF THE BURMESE ARMY Bang Rajan has once again fought us back. If we don't crush them before more people joins them - - They will keep attack us from behind. Then we'll have to fight on two frontiers. Prepare for battle. We are going to Wisetchaichan. THE BURMESE CAMP BY WISETCHAICHAN Our troops at the north frontier wait for us at Ayudhya. But if we can't defeat that lousy village. What's the problem Mang-Changai? COLONEL SUKI What are you afraid of? Continue! Let me speak to that officer. Suki, you are in charge of the slaves right? You are a brave man. Are you not afraid of loosing your head? In my opinion - - a golden Buddha is more worth than a couple of felt-down bars. But if the commander doesn't like my golden gift... ... then I must have my head cut off. But who else is cable of giving you such a gift? Do you think you can achieve what Mang-Changai isn't cable of doing? Mang-Changai says he can't defeat Bang Rajan, - - because their monk is so powerful. - What would you do in his place? - Kill the monk. - Only women and children. - Yes, Sir. It was the burmese... They took all women and children. Wait for me here. Daeng, you get Ai Jan. I shall slaugther all of them! In this life and the next! I slaugther them! Help me cut them down. We bury them proprely in the village. - Who are these two? - My wife and child. I came too late! Each time I have been attacking the burmese, - - I hoped to find my wife and child. What kind of human can be that cruel - - and then proudly display his deeds? This is for you. You knew, how to do it?? I once had a family. I know, how to honour the dead. Ai Jan og Ai Tong Maen... Your families have now found peace. It is us, who still are in this world, which has to suffer. But we don't have to suffer for all eternity. You have to teach the farmers to be strong and determined. Stop! Burmese soldiers! We are here to defeat the enemy and capture their capital, - - not to torture and murder country people, like we were common thieves. You coward! With that softness you just let these outcasts grow stronger. The canons are broken. Ai In, if there really is a life after this one... ... I want to be reborn as your woman. No matter if our child is a boy or a girl, - - I pray to, we also have a child in our next lives. Fire! Kill 'em! E Taeng Aon! Ai nn... If there is a life after this one, - - I want to be reborn as your woman. No matter if our child is a boy or a girl, - - I pray to, we also have a child in our next lives. Does he use magic or what? Let's see, if it works. If swords doesn't hurt him, we have to hammer him down. Aim! Fire! They were so few. But as you see, - they were willing to give their lives to defend their honour and home. They were indeed brave. If all in this country are as brave as those from Bang Rajan, - - Ayudhya will be difficult to conquer. During the burmese army's conquest against Ayudhya - - all the siamese soldiers fleet and evacuated the city. The very same army had been hold back for five month - - by a single small village. Eight times during 1765-66 the inhabitants of Bang Rajan resisted - - the burmese army's attack. When Bang Rajan finnaly gave in, The burmese forces surrounded Ayudhya. Within a year the city was destroyed and the siamese forces beaten. Siam remained fragmented, until the future king Taksin the Great, - - united the Siamese people in one kingdom. The Siamese people had regained their freedom, - - and they have kept it since. Puhhh...hard work done
