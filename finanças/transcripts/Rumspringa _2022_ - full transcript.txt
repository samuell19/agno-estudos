NETFLIX PRESENTS [harmonica plays melodically] Yes, yes! [laughs excitedly] [insects chirping] [harmonica continues melodically] [children playing in distance] [man] Rachel? Samuel. [sniffles] No need to worry, Maem. Your son shall return a better Amish man. Write us, my boy. Okay? Write to us. Eli. [harmonica continues] [sighs] [children laughing] [grunts, gasps] -[man 1] Good day. -[man 2] Good day to you. [man 3] Hello. [harmonica playing melodically] [horse snorts] When Rumspringa's finished and you come home, get baptized, and marry… then you'll grow a beard. It's time now. [warm pastoral music playing] [rooster crows] [Jacob] Dearest Daadi, dearest Maem. Had I only heeded your advice and voyaged across the ocean by boat. Travel by airplane is the most horrible invention you could possibly imagine. Praise the Lord that I've finally arrived. My Rumspringa in the old country can commence at long last. When you read this, I shall be on my way to see our uncle. Rest assured that I'll take good care of our family Bible. This I promise you. Your loving son, Jacob. [woman] Taxi! They don't give a shit if they get a Basquiat or a paint-by-numbers. Just look for something with a cow on it, okay? Or, like, a slaughterhouse. Oh, he's a gentleman. Careful, my bag. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Thank you, sir. Well, we'll meet up soon, though, okay? Yep, see you. Bye. Thanks for your help. I speak German. Well, then, have fun in Berlin. [warm music playing] My sack! -[driver] Have a good flight. -I'm not flying. I'm… I'm just here picking someone up. Stop, stop! My sack! -Carriage, can you follow that machine? -What's that? Follow that car, please. If you would. [engine turns over] [upbeat music playing] [driver] This is wild! Haven't done this before. [laughing] [horn honking] [driver] So, who are we following? -My sack. -Huh? -My luggage. -[driver] Oh, your bag. Your wallet isn't in your bag, is it? Got money, right? I am Amish. My people believe that money itself has no value. -[tires screech] -[Jacob grunts] [horns honking] [church bell tolling] [inquisitive music playing] [footsteps approaching] [Jacob] Good day. List? [people whooping, laughing] Hey, um, do you have more glitter? [bouncer grunts] Mother of God! -He's gorgeous. -[woman gasps] Just perfect. Vintage. Retro. Old-school! Let's take a picture. No, no, no, no! No photos. You mustn't take pictures of me. I'm Amish. -Uh, okay. -What's with him? Amish. The Lord has forbidden our picture-taking. It's vanity. -What did he say? -I don't know. -[man 1] Didn't understand. -[woman shouts] God. -Ahh! -Not my god. -[all laughing] -[woman] Mine either! Ah, hey! Glitter, glitter, glitter! [bouncer] All right, let me see what I got. [all continue whooping and laughing in distance] [heavenly choral music playing] -[man] Yo, man. -What's good? Right. These. [vendor] That everything? These too. [cash register beeping] Good day. All is well? What? How are you? Good, thank you. -[vendor] 13.60. -I'm also Amish. Huh? Wassup? I'm on Rumspringa. You too, right? Uh, no. On a beer run. -See ya, bye. -[vendor] Cheers. [children laughing] I've lost my sack with my money and old family Bible. I simply must find it. Help me, if you would. My uncle was meant to find me at the airship field. [grunts] At the airship field, huh? Airport? He might still be there. Hey, what the hell are you even saying? [phone alarm chimes] IN 10 MINUTES Guys, plans have changed. Catch you later. [lighthearted music playing] Okay, what's your deal? You stalking me, or what? -Yes. -Yes? Well, I'd like you to stop it, dude. Now get outta here. Man, what the hell is wrong with you? Please, sir, if you would. -I must find my Mennonite friends. -Whoa. -I must find my friends-- -Hey! [phone alarm beeping] IN 5 -[thud] -[Jacob cries out] [woman] Hey! This is a bike path, you prick! [Jacob] Ah, fuck. [Jacob] Ay-ay-ay. -[Jacob moans] -[teacher] Keep on walking forward. Don't stare at him. [upbeat music playing] All right. HOW DO YOU TREAT CUTS? Hey, guys! Today, I'll show you how to use household items to treat and bandage a cut. It's best if you cool it and cover it with a Band-Aid or bandage. If it keeps bleeding, please go see a doctor. Don't forget to like and subscribe. -Here. You gotta keep it cold. -[roommate] Mm-hmm. [clears throat] -It's my pizza, but if it helps… -[Jacob] Ow! Uh… Dude, I think he needs a Band-Aid too. [roommate shudders] Hi, Bo. [slurping through straw] Hey, Freja. Alf? The door was open. Hey. ♪ Could I ever create something ♪ -♪ That could stir you up… ♪ -[kissing] I love getting your messages. Um, I didn't send that. No, I mean in general. Your… your messages are always really nice. Did someone text you a honeypot or something? What? No. No one. And so you just… you were just stopping by, or… [Freja] Mm-hmm. [Alf] I got this Amish guy here. -Some yuppie biker mom banged him up. -[Freja] Amish? [Alf] Yeah. [Freja] Those guys live sustainably. How great! -Awesome. Super cool. -Wow. Of course the honeypot was from me. Hmm? [cell phone ringing] [Freja] I gotta go. Bye. Where to? Um, stress at work stuff. And looks like you've got stuff going on. [slurping through straw] What? -[Jacob groans] -Help him. Oh, him? No, man. He's about to head out. -Sometimes you're such a Nazi. -[Alf] Nazi? You never take responsibility, not even for a refugee. Wait, but… He-- He's not… He's not like a refugee. -He just came here-- -You're so weighed down, Alf. By ego. [chuckles awkwardly] You're the one trying to bail on me just 'cause your work's getting a bit stressful, and I'm the one with the ego, huh? Hi! [Freja chuckles] I'm Freja. I am an enormous fan of your eco-culture. Jacob Hostetler of the Hostetler family from Amish country. [Freja] That's so cool. If the whole world lived the way the Amish do, then it wouldn't be falling apart in the next 50 years. Jacob, what is a good person like yourself doing here in Berlin? I'm here on Rumspringa. [Freja] Mm-hmm. It's the one time when we may do the things that are forbidden to us. [Freja] So cool. To be sure the Amish life is what we prefer. Like a sabbatical. [gasps] All the things I'd do. Something with my hands. I'd garden, pull up weeds, ceramics… -No, no, other things. -Something with orphan children. No, we-- we can discover how the other world is. We're permitted to… to experiment, to drink, and… -to party. -[Freja] Nice. You really found the right teacher. Jacob, I think that Alf could learn something from you and you from him. -That is great. -[Freja chuckles] Alf, we Amish love to help a fellow man. Gotta go. I'm working on something bigger than me. I want to do good. But look who I'm talking to. -Bye. -[Jacob moans] -Bye, Bo. -[Bo shudders] [Freja slurping through straw] Sorry, I'd really like to help you out, but today's just a little inconvenient. [Jacob winces] -[Jacob] Ow! Ah. -Right. Uh, hold on. I've got a bit… Do you take PayPal? -Uh, Bo, do you… -Crypto. Just Crypto. It's okay. Many thanks for all your help, Alf. Many thanks, Mr. Bo, for the cloth.

Where's your beard? Mm, just wanted to change it up. [sniffles, clears throat] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [ringing continues, muffled] [ringing continues] Okay, you're here two weeks max, yeah? Less is better. And you pay rent too. Pay rent too? That means giving us money so you can sleep here. -Well, I, for one, am against it. -Bo! Who's on the lease here? There are a few house rules, okay? Rent's paid by the week, and you're gone during the day 'cause… 'cause we both need our space to think. Other than that, no pets, don't play shitty music, and never answer the landline, okay? And when you see I have a girl over, don't talk to her about your Amish bullshit. Alf, no need to worry. I can abide by these rules. I have my own rules. I rise and go to bed with the sun, I give thanks to God whenever I eat, and I strive to do good every day. No drugs, no alcohol… -[beer bottle opens] -…no cars, no dancing, no violence, no music, no instruments, apart from harmonica, but only in the field-- Listen up, here we say, "Sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes the bear eats you." Mm. [Bo] Mm. Mm. [Alf] Okay, whatever. We have a deal? [breathes excitedly] All right. Deal, deal! Many thanks, many thanks. -Many thanks. -Oh yeah. [Jacob chuckles, pats Bo] Many thanks to you. [camera shutter clicks] [upbeat music playing] Are you skilled in woodwork? Yeah, so? [Jacob] Ah. How many logs have you chopped per minute? [Alf] Fifteen. -[camera shutter clicks] -[bed inflates] [heavenly choral music plays distantly] [Bo yelling] -Fuck off! Die, you alien! -[heavy metal playing on video game] [Bo continues yelling] [mimics machine gun firing] Ha ha! Take that, bitch! [yelling] [Bo shouting indistinctly] [shouting and music stop abruptly] [birds chirping] [gentle guitar music playing] [harmonica joins guitar] [door opens] [Alf groans] HELLO, MY SON. THE RENT FOR OCTOBER KISSES, YOUR DAD [toilet flushes] [chuckles] Technology! [chuckles] Huh? Oh… Huh. [Jacob spits, crying out] [Jacob spits, gargles] [blender whizzing] [blender clicks off] Is this my breakfast? Has your wife gone to the market? Wife? Oh, wife? You mean Freja? She's not my wife. Ah, she's your sister. We have sex, Jacob. I mean… mostly sex. Well, if she ever texts me again. [clears throat, scoffs] I don't care if she texts or not. I don't always text her. It's a free country. Drink. [sniffs] Oh! [chuckles excitedly] This libation is exceptional! Quite good. Quite good. Okay, so… -Any idea who took your sack? -No. That gentlewoman was really good-looking. [gasps] She did hand me a card with a pattern on it. I can't determine what it means. Alf… I think this is top secret. Yeah, dude, that's a QR code. [Alf sighs] [phone beeps] -[phone clatters] -[Alf sniffs] [Alf exhales] Yeah, okay, I'll help you out. [chuckles excitedly] Many thanks. [upbeat music playing] Cool, right? Does it have six cylinders? -[Alf] Mm-hmm. -[Jacob] Yeah? Ooh! [laughs excitedly] I love cars! Can I sit down in it? Oh! [gasps] [upbeat music continues] [engine turns over] [thrilling music playing] [siren wailing] [Jacob] That was quite loud. Oh! [laughs] BUTCHER'S [Jacob laughing happily] My daadi bequeathed me a buggy on my 18th birthday. [Alf] Mm. My buggy's a family heirloom. ACTs. ACT? What is this? -A college test. -Ah. You did learn how to read and write, at least? -Arithmetic. -Arithmetic. That's enough for me. And then so then your--- your daadi just gave you a buggy? Like as a gift? Just 'cause? It was meant to take my girl home after Bible study. [Alf] Mm. -Although I still haven't found a girl. -[Alf] Mm. My daadi and I are both very saddened by that. [chuckles thoughtfully] My "daadi" is only saddened that my career's a total failure. Yep. A career? Is that what you're commanded to do with your life? I don't know. What do you have to do? Be a good person. [Alf chuckles softly] Hey! -Isn't this, uh, Satan's Roast? -[woman] Mm-hmm. Ah! Have you any saumage? Saumage? Saumage. It's like this. First you take the belly of a sow, you put potatoes inside, and… [Alf clears throat] Um… We met a girl… a woman. Well, we almost met her, and she left this card behind. -That's our loyalty card. -[Alf] Mm-hmm. -Only our premium members get that. -Oh, premium. -Mm. -[woman] Hmm. [inhales] Well… -Address? -This here is a safe space. Here, we respect man and beast. Mm, too bad. Ah. God, dude, she just needs to scan the card at the register, and then you'd have her name, address, all the deets about your woman. [Jacob] Mm. -[Alf] Hey! -Hey, hey, hey, ease up there! I could work for you, you know. Can you cook? -But cooking is for womenfolk. -[laughs sarcastically] -Um, premium member you said, right? -[woman] Yeah. What do you have to do to get up that high in the food chain around here? Four deliveries a month. I've heard that no one in Berlin can deliver food as fast as this guy here. Does he have a car? [upbeat music playing] [Jacob exclaims] You're too good, Mr. Bo. But when roller hockey starts again, I want them back, yeah? For sure. You built all of that? My final project. You like it? -Whoo! -[skates rattling] [kissing sound] It's really nice. -What is it? -Uh, it's a library. Okay, be honest here. What aspect would you say is the most annoying when you walk into a library? That there are so many books to choose from that you can't tell which ones are worth reading, right? Yeah, but my library is app-driven. Smart architecture. You get reviews in real time right as you walk by the books. Whoo! Okay, think about it. You're walking inside, right? You're inside, and the shelves are completely full. I would already know which book I wanted to read. Oh yeah? Which one? The Old Testament. Okay, well, duh. Try to think of another one. [Jacob] Well… The New Testament. Come on. The Bible, man? Nothing else? -Just the Lord's word is worth reading. -[Bo] Attacking! -[skates rolling] -Ah, there! Right. -You're all set. -Many thanks. Well, then, I think your people might not be the target group for this. [upbeat music playing] [Jacob] Dear Daadi, dear Maem, I must remain in Berlin for a bit longer. Something bad has befallen me. It pains me to say that I've lost our family Bible. But do not worry, the Lord has sent me help. -An English. His name is Alf. -[phone beeps] He seems a bit lonely to me, and I'm not certain how he spends his days in his shared lodgings… -[phone ringing] -…but he is good at heart. Until I'm able to find the gentlewoman who took our family Bible… [man on intercom] Hello? Who is it? Hello? Your food is here. [Jacob] Believe it or not, I'm permitted to live amongst them as long as I strive to live the life of a good Amish son every day. Your son, Jacob. [door opens] [Jacob snoring] [urinating] -Good evening. [yells] -[Freja screams] The Amish, Jesus! -Heart attack over here. -[toilet flushing] -[door closes] -[Jacob sighs] [phone beeps] [Jacob] Alf! -Alf. -Yeah? I can no longer sleep on the sofa. I'm in need of a bed, really. -[otter squeaking] -[Jacob exhales] -This is a good tree for a bed. -[Alf] Yeah? The Amish build everything by hand. -Okay, we doing this or what? -Mm-hmm. How many logs can you chop a minute again? Uh, I think 24. -Yeah? -[Alf] Mm-hmm. Good. -Me? -Yeah. For sure. [Alf clears throat] [Alf grunts] Confounded English! That swing could've crippled you! Then show me how it's done. Ay-ay-ay. [Alf] Hmm. [Jacob exhales] -I'll show you how it's done. -Can't wait to see. [Jacob sighs] [chopping] [harmonica music playing] You must move over, yeah? -[Alf] Good? -Mm-hmm. Yes. [Alf] Here? [ax thuds] -Yeah, up top. -[ax thuds] -[ax thuds] -And now… [Jacob and Alf grunting] [gentle music playing] Oh! -What? Why "oh"? -[Jacob] Run!

For life as an Amish in the Amish country? For all time with a wife? And free from the temptations of the world? Yes, Daadi. You've hidden your car magazine. [elevator whirring] [elevator bell dings] Whoa, oh! Ah, Ina Kantas? [woman] Thank you. Stop! Who is that gentlewoman? Stop, stop! -Hey, hey! -That woman! Is that Ina Kantas? She took my family Bible. [sighs] Finally. I was about to throw this crap away. Ciao. [bright guitar music playing] [harmonica joins in] NAME AND DATE OF BIRTH [horse neighs] [Jacob's father] Look. In our old family Bible, we're all together. There, in the fatherland… Germany. That's where your roots are. Nothing is wrong with you. Perhaps they'll know where you come from. Go visit there and fill the empty page here! [Alf] What the fuck? -Every single name in your entire family? -[Jacob] Mm-hmm. [Alf] Dude, back to 1754? And this here is the last Hostetler. This one page is still empty. When I find out who it is we descend from in the fatherland, I'll know why I'm Amish then, and I can be baptized. That's so insane! [gentle song playing] How is the best way to travel to my Mennonites? -Yep. -[keyboard clacking on phone] Yeah. I think there's an ICE train. I-C-E. I-I could drive you. I mean, 'cause taking trains is probably forbidden for you, right? We're allowed to use everything, as long as we're not the driver. But you've already been a great help. Many thanks. I'll make my way there alone. ♪ Stay ♪ ♪ Stay ♪ [birds chirping] [gasps] I've never slept in so late in all my life. [Bo] Mm. Uh, it's eight o'clock, man. It's not late. -[Alf] Try to stay still. -[Jacob] What are you doing? Before you take off to see your Mennonites, I've put together a little farewell present for you here, all right? Okay, now go and have a look. [clears throat] [Jacob gasps] Oh! It's the beard of a married man. -Um… -[Jacob sighs happily] My friend, Jorge, is throwing a little goodbye party, and I'm the co-host. [Jacob] Ah… Yeah, so… would you maybe want to come with? Want to come? Oh, uh… Hey, dude, come on. You can have at least one night of Rumspringa, man. Oh, I better not. Okay, you know what? I-- I'll go alone. Do what you want with your beard. Walk around the block, or, uh, do whatever a married man would do. I don't care. Bye. [Jacob clears throat] I'll come, then. Just for one night. Bo, hey, man! -Amish kid's gonna party! -[Bo] Yeah, whoo! Party time! Hey, don't do that. That's not cool. -Okay. -[Alf] Um… Do this, though. This. then… snap, snap, snap. Poof. [clicks tongue] Come. -[Bo] Whoo! -[tires screeching] [Bo laughs] Yeah! -Whoo! -[upbeat music playing] [tires screech] [partygoers laughing, cheering] -Hey! -[Bo] Whoo! -[girl screams] -[Alf] What's up, big girl? You good? All right! Awesome party! BYE JORGE & JACOB Oh, if we lose track of each other, we'll just meet here by the tub, okay? Bam-bam-bam-bam-bam-bam. Check-bam! -[partygoers laughing, cheering] -[party music playing] So where did you get your shirt? It's totally awesome. My maem stitched it for me. [Freja] Hey, Alf! There you are! [laughing] Ah, Alfie! From Melmac? And who are you, man? This is Urs. He's an investor. -[Bo] Mm. -[Alf] You're what? For my start-up. Huh? Do good things, Alf. Jacob knows just what I mean, right? Uh… A reusable, sustainable Q-tip. An everyday object reinvented. Highly Instagrammable. Woman-owned. Yeah, the first round of funding, five million euros! Um, why didn't you mention it to me? Just look at my feed. I sent you a few text messages, and… I wanted to ask you, like… Well, I don't want to get conventional or anything, you know, but… could you imagine the two of us dating, exclusively? Exclusive? Monogamy. Uh… [chuckles awkwardly] Uh… Here, this is for you. Do Amish people use Q-tips? -Um… -The beard looks good. So? -[partygoers chatting indistinctly] -[party music playing] [woman laughing] What is this? It's for dipping. [laughing] -Many thanks. -Bon appétit. [Jacob] Melon tastes a bit different here. [mystical music playing] [electricity crackling] [Jacob moaning] [distorted laughter] [chill music playing] It's wonderful. -What is? -[laughing] What you built for your college. Smart architecture. Yeah, but if I botch the exam, then that's it. My father's gonna ask me what he did wrong. Why does your father send you money? [hookah gurgling] [blows] I saw the bank statements on the table. That's right. Amish can read. [chuckling] I went to school for eight years. My daadi says you've learned enough by then. -[hookah gurgling] -Is that true, Alf? Is it better? [chuckles softly] Why doesn't anyone ask me what I want to be? Why? No real books, just the Bible. [both laughing] [Alf] You know what? -I think it's time. -For what? Time for Jacob's very first… beer. No. Whoa! [laughing] Praise be to God! This is unbelievably good! -Oh! -[Alf coughing] [both laughing] [dance music playing] -And you know what we're going to do now? -Hmm? We get up, go out there, and dance with them. -No. -Mm-hmm. -No. -Yeah. -No. -We're doing that. Hell yeah, we are. -Alf, please, no. -Come. You're coming now. Come. [Jacob] Alf, Alf, I'm not allowed! Leave it. [dance music continues] Hey, come on. You, dance. -Look, we're all dancing. -I'm not allowed to. You're on Rumspringa today! Now's the time. Come on, let yourself go. Just dance!

[chill music playing on stereo] [Ina] New haircut? I just wanted to change it up. -I see. I'll get you some dry clothes. -[Jacob] Mm-hmm. Many thanks. [Ina clears throat] Do you like vegan? [Jacob] Mm-hmm. All of the sins I've committed here. Yeah, well, to be honest, there's actually very few sinful things on here. -[Jacob] Mm. -Roller skating? We are not allowed. Although others are. It's complicated. I'm Amish. On Rumspringa. When you try out forbidden things. I know. I did some googling. But you still have the guilty feeling. -[door closes] -[phone keyboard clacking] [inhales] Hey. Hi. [chuckles softly] Do you like this? -Mm, I don't know. -Fine if not. It's just personal taste. Maybe I should go live with you. I can give a feminism TED Talk there. We'd manage things somehow, right? No? In any case, this would be my gift to everyone. -[Alf moaning] -And the housesitting in Sicily? Imagine. -[Alf] Mm-hmm. -I said I'd go with you. [Alf and Freja panting] Then I'm not imagining it anymore. 'Cause we are going together. [Freja laughing breathlessly] [Ina] When I was a kid, I used to go to art galleries after school just because it was free. My first love. [chuckles] And you? Is it a sin for the Amish to fall in love? Well, we only fall in love once in our lives. We remain bonded forever. I'm doing a cleanse right now. Hmm. What do you have to clean? [Ina chuckling] I'm… well, I've been abstaining from sex for a little while, which means I'm living the same kind of sexless life as you. But I do know what I'm missing. [gentle music playing] [both moaning and laughing] [breathing heavily] -Do you want to spend the night here? -[Freja] Huh? As far as relationships go, I really just can't find time to go on dates, and I really have no patience for all that. And I have no patience for kids. I mean, when I have kids, what does that mean for me and for my relationship? It's all so complicated. Here, everything is complicated.

[Freja laughs] [kisses] Good night. -Good night. -[Alf kisses] Are you married yet? Mm. I haven't found my woman yet. Once I did think I'd finally found my wife. I rode with her after Bible study. We rode together in my buggy. [Ina] And? Her name is Ruth. We've known each other since we were but five years old. [chuckles] [Ina] Ruth. Tell me about her. She's hard-working, and she's strong. [Ina laughing] What? Okay, that really is important. -[Jacob] Mm-hmm. -[Ina] Mm. Um, yeah, but… is there something romantic? She has red hair. [laughing] Something romantic! What do you think when you look into her eyes? Brown. And when I… when I close my eyes, in my mind, I can see her face. When I look into her eyes, I forget to breathe. [laughing] How nice for her. [Jacob sighs] But then she met my brother, David. Oh well. Mm, what? It's just… I feel unwell. I must go home. [water running] [Jacob breathing heavily] Jacob. [water turns off] Can't fall asleep either. Freja, she lit a scented candle. -It stinks.

Alf, are you in love with Freja? [Alf] Mm. I'm scared that one day I'm gonna meet a fortune-teller, and she'll tell me… "You've already met the love of your life, and, well, it was Freja." Yeah, but you've expressed your love, haven't you? God, that'd be so incredibly cringe. You must be truthful to each other, not just play around. You must be committed. Here, it's not like that. Here, it's a little more a dance. A game, sort of. Just child's play. You two must come to know each other as you both really are. What do you fancy about your Freja? Plenty. Well, apart from the obvious stuff, you know? Like how she's always thinking of others, and the environment. Yeah, like with the start-up. The sustainable Q-tips. That's an awesome thing! [Jacob] Mm. You ought not let anyone tell you their path is better just because you haven't found yours yet, Alf. Could say the same about you. [Alf sniffles] [sniffles] What about you? [Jacob] Hmm? [Jacob] What? Man, you've fallen in love. -What? No! -[Alf] Of course. -No! No! -Yes, I can smell it. I smell it. I'm not talking about someone-- some girl from Pennsylvania who you met in the sandbox and who's actually your half-sister. It's no good, Alf. I need an Amish maiden. A good wife. [exhales] Hey, man. Hold up. You have a beer in your hand, you drove a '67 Mercedes Pagode just now, and you're talking about a good wife? Man, wake up. You're still on Rumspringa! You should enjoy your life now, try some things out, man! Party it up! Turn up! [Jacob chuckling] Why don't you stay a little longer? I'm just starting to have fun with you. -[Alf sniffles] -[beer bottle scrapes cement] And I, um… I wanted to apologize to you. I think I kind of used you a little at first to try to get with Freja. So, sorry. All is forgiven.

[Ina and Freja laughing] -[Freja] I got it! -[Ina sighs] Jacob, why am I here? This is how the Amish get to know our maiden friends. I see. Do you want to play with me?

[Freja giggles] [atmospheric music playing] What is it? I've never seen a woman play volleyball so poorly. But I-I don't care, though. [Ina] Is that a compliment? -Yes. -[Ina chuckles] For gym, I had doctor's notes. I kind of had six years of period pain. Where is that? Here. [Jacob] Hmm. Sorry, I forgot that you're Amish and that we're from two completely different universes. What do you mean by that? I feel like I have to protect you from my corruption. I don't want to seduce you or anything. The man must look after his woman. No, that's not true. You really mustn't talk about "seduction" and "period pain." [yelling] Menstruation! Vulva! I'm Amish.

Urs jumped ship, and I had to dismiss the team. [Alf chuckles] -What? -[Freja] Mm-hmm. -You're kidding. -[Freja] Mm. -Mm-mm. -Hang on. Wait, but the-- What about the five-million-euro investment, hmm? It's all gone. That's it. Urs was more interested in investing in me and him. What a fuckhead. [Freja] Mm-hmm. Yeah, but, how come you didn't say anything? I didn't want you to feel sorry for me. Hmm? [Alf clears throat] So it's just trash now? I'm onto the next thing. And I'm gonna be housesitting with you in Sicily soon, hmm? [Alf inhales] [inhales again] Alf? You know, the… the Amish guy had said to be true to myself and to others, and… I want to be true to you, Freja. [giggles] Aw. You… You… Well, you're like a new girl every day. With new likes, with new convictions. The thing that was so badass yesterday is done. And your sustainable Q-tips here, now they're just trash. Just makes me think of us. [melancholy music playing softly] I mean, imagine if… things are difficult between us, would you just throw me away? You're right, maybe… Yeah, maybe I'm just ego. But, I… I don't think I'm the only one. But this is about you right now. Yeah, or it's… it's about you. But never us. [Freja sighs] Bye, Alf. We won't see each other anymore? [Freja] Mm-mm. Bye, Freja. [bittersweet music playing] [breathing shakily] [grunts softly] [footsteps departing] [crying softly] [kissing] [gentle music playing softly] Everything okay? What's going on? Um, there are other men coming too? What? Did Alf show you some porn? No. Mr. Bo. [Ina laughing] Forget everything you saw in that porn, okay? Almost everything.

[Jacob] Alf. I've sinned horribly. Never! How was it? [sighs] Truly great. You're such a killer dawg! I shan't do that. Okay, quietly. [toilet flushing] So did he screw her? Yeah, man. -Aw, man. Even the Amish. -[Alf] Even the Amish guy, dude! But you gotta be careful. You're not used to all these emotions at once. No. [exhales loudly] [Alf sniffles] Something happened? Oh yeah. I ended things with Freja earlier. Or I-I don't know. She ended it with me. Or we-we both did. No idea, but now it's definitely over. And how do you feel? Relieved. [door opens] [Bo] Um, that was your stepmom on the phone, and I answered it by mistake. Mr. Bo! What about the apartment rules? You see? Listen to the Amish. What did you say to her? -[clears throat] That you're not here. -[Alf] Nice. And what did she say? That your father just died. Funny. What did she say? That your father just died. [delicate music playing] [Alf sniffles] [sniffles] I didn't like him very much anyway. Why-- Why should I be crying? Would be-- be absurd. [sniffles] [sniffles] It's all right, Alf.

My newfound friend Alf has a grieving heart, and it is my duty to help him out in any way I can. He feels unsure about himself, and he confided in me that he's never been able to determine what the right or the wrong path is in life, where his place is in the world, where he ought to go, or what he ought to do.

You're trying to seek out what is real, in order to find what's beneath it all. That's not cheesy. Come with me. It's wonderful. Hey! Don't touch that! This is mine. What's it doing here?

[sniffles] You are a really shitty friend. -Alf. -No, don't "Alf." -Bo was there, you understand? -I was there. I'm so utterly sorry. Ina sold my picture for a large amount of money, and so we partied and got drunk, and I have a-- I have a-- a headache. -Headache? -[Jacob] Yes. Man, what the hell is wrong with you, Amish guy? You-- You said that Rumspringa is party time. Yeah, one big-ass party, man! And the best time for a party is the day of my father's funeral! Exactly. Exactly what I meant. Alf, I have a great sum of money I want to give you. Jacob, are you a fucking idiot? Why would I take your money from you, man? Because your daadi isn't alive anymore, so who's going to take care of you? [Alf scoffs] Definitely not you. At least I'm doing things! You spend your time with me purely so you don't have to go to your exam so you don't have to get your life started. [Jacob sighs] Out. Get the fuck out. [dramatic music playing] [footsteps departing rapidly] [singer vocalizing] [bell tolling] [indistinct conversations] Whoa, look at that ride there. -[car door closes] -I'll be back. I'm Jacob Hostetler from Amish country. Ah. Peter Hochstedtler from the fatherland. Hostetler, Hochstedtler. Think we might be related, hmm? [Jacob chuckles] You really took your time though. Shall we? [Alf] Fuck you, dude. What a fuckin' asshole. I was so ashamed of myself about the funeral. I just drove right off. And this is the original leather. How did he keep it in such good condition? It is the most precious thing he has. Hmm. And what's the most precious thing that you have? I don't know. Ah, well, when I was your age, I certainly didn't know any of that stuff either. Lots of-- Lots of people are as old as me, and they don't know either. It can happen to anyone. When I wasn't sure if I was going to stay with God or if I would remain forever on, mm-- Rum-- Rumspringa, I consulted many, many people trying to find out which path is for me. Do you know who had the answer to that? Who? No one. I had to figure it out all by myself. And then, and then came my Hannah. Hannah was the answer to everything. [chuckles softly] She, she-- She was the-- She is the most precious thing I have. She and our eight spoiled children. [chuckles] How and where I wanted to live didn't matter, as long as it was with her. You're the only person who can determine what's right for you. Whether that way is Amish, English, or Mennonite. Not as a Mennonite. And how come? Well, what's so wrong about the way we choose to live around here? Can you let your beards grow out? Yes, in Germany we're allowed to do that. I don't really understand it, but we… but we… Mm. There's a lot about the Amish Ordnung that I don't understand. [scoffs] Yeah, me neither. I mean, take the zippers, for example. They make life so much simpler, mm? Yeah, I've seen that. [Peter] Mm-hmm. Have you already found what you're looking for? [Jacob] I want to find my roots. [car door closes] [pastoral music playing gently] FAMILY CHRONICLE MY CHILDREN There. Jakob Hochstedtler, your forefather from the fatherland. [Peter chuckles] FAMILY CHRONICLE H-Hey, so did your daadi tell you to go find the empty page in the fatherland? [Peter laughing] The old parental trick. [continues laughing] Jacob, your daadi of course meant well by you. You're-- You're in the process of searching. He wanted you to have your own set of experiences. [Peter chuckles, sighs] You know… [sighs] …you're not gonna find all of life's answers in here. What you want to do with your life is something only you can determine, even as an Amish person. [thoughtful music playing] [Jacob sighs] Is there wood you can lend me? [car engines roaring] [upbeat music playing] -Yeah, that would be dope. Hey! -Yeah. Good day. -[Jacob] Alf! -[footsteps approaching] Alf! We just rented your mattress to someone else. -Where's Alf? -He went to the airport. But the exam! He didn't go to it. Because of your fuck-up with the funeral. Even I was there. Me. [engine roaring] [engine spluttering] -[Jacob groans] -[engine dies] -[hitting dash] -Come on!

No, I think he's here for me. Oh… Oh, I'm sorry. Or a man, of course. [chuckles awkwardly] [sets cup down] Alf, Alf, wait there! Alf, wait! -Well, what's all this, then? -I built a new model for you. For your exam. Smart architecture, designed by English, made by Amish. I'm not doing the exam. I'm housesitting in Sicily now, alone. Well, what is it? You wanted me to show commitment. Here you go. Alf, you have to finish your college degree. I was only in school for eight years, and look how incapable I am. Hmm. I think you get along fine. I was in a library. I wanted to read all the books, but I didn't know which to read first. I needed your app. [ticket agent] Ticket, please. Really. [announcer on PA] Dear passengers, the Alitalia flight… [man] Let's go. …to Palermo has begun to board. Please make your way to the gate. Dear passengers… You're my target group? For sure.

Perhaps don't tell this to the bishop, but here is my decision. I'm staying in Berlin and continuing my Rumspringa a while longer. I'm telling you, I'm positively trippin'. I believe that's supposed to mean that I'm all right and I feel good because I've discovered that the best invention in life is actually life itself. There's quite a lot of Rumspringa to be done in Berlin. Tell that to the bishop, or perhaps not, but I feel I'm doing well. I'm finally figuring out who I am and what I'm capable of doing. It would be a shame to have access to all this and let it pass me by. I'm not sure when I'll come home to Pennsylvania because the people I've met here could use the help and guidance -of an Amish person… -[father chuckling] …and that makes me feel good.
