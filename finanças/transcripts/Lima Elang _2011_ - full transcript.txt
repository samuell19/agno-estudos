Okay. Ready? Wait. - Ready? - I'm ready. Where's Baron? I don't know. Maybe he's upstairs? Now your record will be nothing but chalk dust. Go! Armature winding. Oh, Baron. You're really good at making my heart race when you do stuff like that. I broke your record. What did I tell you? Today is my day. You mean your last day? REGISTRATION OPENS APRIL 1ST I'll be back on school break. We will definitely join this competition. Baron! Baron, come on. Wait. BARON TIMELESS RECORD. For you. My most reliable one. Let's go. Our catering company has plenty of orders today. Your mom's looking for you. Help your siblings get ready for school. It's time to go to school. You're gonna be late. - Where is it? - I don't know. - Anton! - Where did you put it? NUSA DHARMA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Rusdi. Is the bell broken again? I've reported it, but no response. Of course it's broken again. The school will start in a minute. Let Miss Jujuk do the roll call. "Senny, Endang, Dimas, Hilmy, Dafa, Karsimin. Where is he?" You're Baron, right? I'm Supri, the vice principal. Come on. Let's go and see the principal. In the last year, Scouts has got a lot of attention. You mean like how even the House Members go abroad for comparative study? That's not it. Scouts numbers in Indonesia are the highest in the world. But last week, only Husni came for Scouts practice. Rusdi. Right. Rusdi. But the others are still active too. If they were active, it would be 20-to-40 kids attending practice, not just four kids. Mr. Amir. Just ask the students to come for Scouts practice. That's not how Scouts works. Wanting to be a Scout has to come from the soul of the kids. The point is, don't let it become embarrassing for us. Select the team to join the Scouts camp for the branch in East Kalimantan. - What its name? Bentang... - Bintang Utama. Yes. Bintang Utama. Schedule it before handing out the report cards. Or just cancel it. Excuse me. This is the new student from... The new student from Jakarta? Come on. I'll take you to class. - Hurry! - Get to class. Get to class. - Let's go upstairs. - Hurry! Hurry. Sit down. Anybody want to try? Morning, students. Morning. He's your new friend from Jakarta. Oh? From Jakarta? Maybe he has to repeat a grade, and that's why he moved here. So he can be promoted to the next grade. Introduce yourself. My name is Baron Aruna. Continue with the class. Baron, find a seat. Maybe our new friend would like to try our experiment? Baron? No. I think he's still airsick. Just sit then. Okay, students. We'll talk about... Baron? Baron, aren't you hungry? I have salted egg. Yes, later. We have to do whatever it takes to join the camp. If we can join the camp here, the next step is the national jamboree. - How cool is that? - That's cool. I'll do the thinking about the way to do it. You just be ready to help me. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT KEEP GOING, NEVER GIVE UP Attention! I have good news for you. The regional level of the Scouts camp will be held in our town. That's a big event for Scouts all throughout East Kalimantan. You can all participate. It's easy. Anton. Give me back the form at the school gate after school, okay? I'm sorry for the small paper size. Consider it saving our trees. Rusdi. Will Matahari Elementary School join it too? They will, for sure. Their Girl Scouts is great. You want to see Sandra, right? Drink more milk first. You're skinny like a stick. And maybe only Sandra's shadow would care to look at him. I'll throw this banana at you! Shut up! You're the new student from Jakarta, aren't you? My name is Rusdi Badrudin, Scout. You can join this program. You will get more new friends. They'll all be Scouts. Cool. It's still loose. Needs to be tightened up. Do you know what it is? No, but it looks so cool. Rusdi. It's like a girl's room here. Report. These are the members of our Bintang Utama team. This is Anton. His fire attraction is getting better. It will be useful in the skill test. But it's safe, right? It's safe. Rio and Chandra are ready for the physical test. And this is Aldi. He's really interested in joining us. How many members do we need? Actually ten, but six will do, so we just need one more. With this situation, it will be difficult for us. Relax. I have a new candidate. You won't be disappointed in him. Rusdi. We need to use the wooden stick. The bell is broken again. - What's broken? - You. I mean the school bell, it's broken again. Yes, broken. Why me? You can make a small dynamo, so I'm sure you can do it. It's working. It's working again. Thank you. It's working. Baron? Wait. Aren't you supposed to wear this uniform today? Change now. Today, I will announce those who have been selected to be members of the Bintang Utama Camp during school break. For the boy's team. Rusdi Badrudin. Anton Suryadi. Rio Sudjono. Chandra Sudjono. Aldi Simbolon. And the last one is Baron Aruna. Baron Aruna. I don't know anything about Scouts. - Anyone can be a scout. - That's right. I have assigned Rusdi to arrange a special program for you and the other members. Because everything has to be settled before the report card is handed out. BOY SCOUTS I told him that we need you. I don't need Scouts. I will not join the camp. I will spend my holidays in Jakarta, not here, and meet my RC gang. Back again with me, Zoraya, on Link News Update. Here are the details. Illegal logging and rare wildlife theft are repeatedly occurring in the Kalimantan forest... ...small group, but with the intense activity... Don't worry about him. I'm sure he'll stop sulking in a week. I know. But I think he needs to spend his school break in Jakarta. Wi, our child is a big boy. You shouldn't coddle him like a girl. What if he can't survive on his own? How can he adjust to his surroundings? It's not about being a boy or a girl. Children sometimes need space for themselves. Don't you agree? - Who is that? - I don't know. I'll go and check. One second, please. - Good morning, sir. - Morning. My name is Rusdi Badrudin, Scout. - You must be Mr. Mahendra, Baron's father. - That's right. I'm here to give you this letter and invite Baron to practice starting tomorrow. "Scout Camp for Elementary School"? Provincial level, East Kalimantan. Baron? A scout? He was appointed by Mr. Amir, our scout leader. Wi. - Yes. - Come in. - Wi, you have to see this. - What's that? It's a very good idea. This is Rusdi. Have a seat. - Wi, take a look at this. - What is this? The scout camp in East Kalimantan. It's much better than going to Jakarta. Yeah. True. If he joins it, he will learn important lessons from it. Yes. Have you had breakfast? Yes, ma'am. My grandma made some porridge. But the bread there looks so good. - Just eat some. - It's okay. You want some milk? Orange juice? - It's all right, I'm fine. - Are you sure? I think it's a good event. Speak of the devil. Baron, come here. Look at this. I think I'd better go now. - What's the rush? - I should. - Baron just got here, but you're leaving? - Yeah. All right, then. I'll walk you to the door. Look at this. Why didn't you tell me you'd joined the Scouts? Read this. It looks like a fun program. Yes. Bintang Utama camp. Now that's my boy. What do you think? - It's cool. - Don't you think? I'm not going to the camp. - I will go to Jakarta. - Why? You'll go there to play with that toy car, right? Hey, this RC car is not just a toy. You and Mom are selfish! Why are you talking like that? Baron, what are you doing? Hi, Dul. Are you guys all there? Baron, there was an exhibition of RC cars from Japan. It was really cool. An exhibition? From Japan? Are you serious? Of course. Why would I lie? Baron, they will have an exhibition in Balikpapan too. Buy me something there. I didn't get anything here. No problem. Just email me your address... Dul, I can't go to Jakarta this time. What? What do you mean? What about our contest? My parents told me to join the camp event for Scouts here. Are you serious? Scouts? You've gotta be kidding. Forget it. I don't want to talk about it. You'll waste your credit. - Don't forget to email me. - All right. REGISTRATION OPENS APRIL 1ST BANGKIRAI CAMPING GROUND, BALIKPAPAN Hello. I got your email. Are you sure the exhibition will be located around Bangkirai hill? Yes. Why? Nothing. Can you do it? Rusdi, wait! I think we will have a problem due to the lack of members. Sorry, I'm late. Okay. Let's start again. This is it, the grades are great. He's not here yet? Baron, I'm happy to see you're excited. Take care. Don't do anything funny. Why are you looking at him so suspiciously? I'm not. Do you want salted egg for breakfast? One, two, three. Louder. WELCOME TO BANGKIRAI CAMPING GROUND BINTANG UTAMA CAMP PARTICIPANTS Here we are. Bintang Utama Camp. March. Motion, march. Motion, march. Ready! We're wearing our uniforms neatly. Ropes and whistles are also ready. My neckerchief is red and white. Belt! Our shoes are tidy. Both socks are black. Flag. Up. - Go, go! - Come on! Go, go! What are you doing? Making a barrier. To prevent snakes and other animals from getting in. Why didn't you tell me there would be snakes? Don't worry. Hello, everyone. You must be tired. I'm here to tell you that we'll have tons of interesting events at this camp. We'll have plenty of games, competitions, and creativity contests. And the main event is the game of Markas Bintang. It's to determine the best team at this camp. And we will name The Scout of Bintang Utama. The best scout. The winner is eligible to participate in the national jamboree. Now, let me take all your cell phones. Come on. You'll get it back later. I said all cell phones. The one inside your sock. Enjoy your rest. We have to become the best team. I thought those boys were flaming like Baron's car. Turns out it was smallpox. GROUP, NUSA DHARMA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL We are... Nusa Dharma! Now, I will explain the division of groups. We are one big squad. This squad consists of groups. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, take three steps to the right. Go! One step to the right. Go! Groups 1, 2, and 3, two steps to the right. Go! - Two steps to the right. Go! - At ease! Hey, guys! Anton! Baron! - Where are the others? - I don't know. Have you had your meal? I'm calling you here for a discussion. We need to find a way to be named the best team. What task did you get earlier? I was told to hold a discussion. Dress right. - Dress! - Dress! Dress. WOMEN'S TOILET, MEN'S TOILET Get in line. I know. Little kids like him have to go first. I have a list of group names right here. The representative of each group, please come forward. GROUP RANK EAGLE And now it's time for you to choose your group leader in a democratic way. I'll read it now. "Rusdi." "Rusdi." "Rusdi." "Baron." Thank you. I accept this mandate. Now, as group leader, I will choose my deputy. And I choose Baron. You can't do that. This is the Scouts way. The runner-up is the deputy. You should've picked me. Rusdi, what do we do now? - Are you ready? - Yes! The competition is about to start! Come on! - It's okay. We believe in you. - That's right. You can do it all by yourself. Come on, Sindai, go, go! The quality of the participants this time is terrible. Someone asked if we have a hot bath when they just got here. Spoiled. The Scouts nowadays are terrible. All they can do is play games. We have to teach them a lesson. I don't think we do. Everyone on my team is nice, I think. Rusdi, should we ask Sindai to join our group? As long as you have me, we can do it on our own. - Go! - Win! GROUP RANK Baron? What are you doing here? Aren't you supposed to be in your tent and resting? I notice you like to be alone. Why? I wasn't supposed to be here in the first place. You said you're a scout. But you keep cleaning your hand. I have sensitive skin. I get a reaction when it's dirty. Then why did you join the Scouts? They teach me not to easily give up in Scouts. If we win the Bintang Utama Scout title, what's the prize? We won't get a prize, but this. This. Cool, huh? They will recognize me as a great scout. This is my reason for joining the camp. PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT KEEP GOING, NEVER GIVE UP We have to become a great team too, and win the Markas Bintang competition. Win it with this kind of group? What is Markas Bintang? It's the ultimate competition. Only the two best groups from each squad can participate in that competition. Every participant has to find and conquer the headquarters that the scout leaders hide. Top secret. Looks like they're hiding it very well. Do they hide the headquarters far from here? Outside the campsite? We have to search for it outside this campsite? Every member has to do their best to win. We can win the competition by waving this flag in Markas Bintang. It means we have won the Markas Bintang Utama competition. Now, we start with the number puzzle. You have to find out the meaning behind these numbers. - Is that clear? - Yes! You have one hour starting from... now! It's easy. It would be easier if we could use a calculator. But unfortunately, they took my cell phone. Get some rocks. Plenty of them. You took a Kumon course, right? My grandpa taught me this. Math is not your enemy. He said math is all around us. Pito said there's a hidden message in these quantifications, right? It means one quantification is one letter. R. A. Time is almost up. Submit your results. Come on. M. Time is up! For the time being, the leading group is... Group... Eagle! Finally, we won! We're leading! I was suspicious. There are no words like "dense" and "parasite" there. Yes. Finally, we won! Thank you. A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H... O, P. Then it must be "P." Let's sing our victory song. Your group is an appendix group. I can remove it with surgery anytime. I'll remove your face with surgery! Only people who are afraid to lose act like this. Complaining and criticizing. You shouldn't have stopped me. I'd have taught him a lesson. Guys, this is Sindai. You remember her, don't you? You don't mind if she joins us and relaxes here? Why are you taking her here? We talked about strategy earlier. Her strategy is very good. Her group always won. Here's the answer. - Is she in there already? - I think so. Let me check. Do you like Sandra? Do you know her? She's my classmate. Why? Can you introduce me to her? She's kind and has beautiful hair. Do you know? Inside that forest, there's a Batutut. It will be furious if someone disrupts the forest. That's just a myth. A myth to keep the children from going into the forest at night. Besides, there's no such thing as a forest guardian like that. You know a lot about the forest? It's my first time here. If we win this contest, we can catch wildlife thieves too. Maybe we can catch that Batutut for Sindai. Get in here, Anton. Try it. Sorry. I was holding my breath when you measured me for the hole. Rusdi. Got it? Take a good look around you. Don't let any trash be left on the ground. Take a closer look around you. Don't let any trash be left on the ground. BANGKIRAI CAMPING GROUND, BALIKPAPAN Tiger! Eagle! What else are we making now? Tell him, Anton. We will make group brooches from candles. We'll use an old technique. The other groups won't know about it. We will win the "creating a souvenir" competition. Why are you so interested in Scouts? I'm sure it's a common enough reason. His father was a Scout. His brother was a Scout too. A family Scout. Scouts are my family is more like how it is. That's the truth. I live with my grandma. My mom works in Hong Kong. My grandma is old. The house is quiet now. Where's your old man? Old man? Where's your father? He hasn't come back for three years. I asked him to teach me to climb a high tree. I couldn't do it after a long time spent practicing, and he got mad. The next day, he left the house. He hasn't come back ever since. Maybe he was disappointed in me. But lucky for me, I have Scouts. Scouts is always there for me as long as I try to be the best. How is it, Anton? - Anton. Your face. - Your face is black like a soldier's. Done. Ready. One, two... Got it. It's done. You can observe your friends or anyone for around 30 minutes. Hello, Grandma. I forgot to buy credit for my cell phone. I was just saying hello to Grandma when my credit ran out. Do you have any brothers or sisters? Your mom has a catering business at home? No wonder you're free to do your hobby. But me? When I try new fire tricks... My mom has many staff and my younger siblings are fussy. Is it that bad? Come to my house one day. Try to babysit my four younger siblings. Four? And they're all boys. You're still lucky. Imagine having older siblings, all girls. They're all bossy. Does it have to be tight? Try this to roll it. If my grandma's old cassette gets tangled, I roll it with this stuff. You try. What are you doing here? You said you knew Sandra. - Let's go. - Okay. Sandra. Somebody wants to meet you. I'm busy now. I think you two make a better couple. Come on. Everybody, quiet now. I will explain the rules for the Markas Bintang Utama contest tomorrow. First, you're not allowed to cheat. Number two... Rusdi, can you help me? Please get me the batteries on the big table inside. Okay. Let's go, Baron. I know how to win this contest. There's a loophole in the rules of Markas Bintang Utama that we can use. Each group has to find eight points' worth of clues, one in-between post, and one big headquarters. But if we go straight to the in-between post, we'll reach the headquarters faster. How do we know it's the in-between post? Okay, start! Bring this inside. - Good day, Arif. - Got it. Got it. Give us a hand! We're going to the next post. I learned about this campsite quietly. I think I know where the in-between post is. But I'm still not sure about it. We have to set a strategy. Are you sure? I feel like that's cheating. Wouldn't it be better if we go to post number one first? And then from there... We talked about it, didn't we? Trust me. It's strategy, not cheating. Aldi, please help. Anton. What are we doing now? Just follow me. Rusdi! Are you all right? Let's go back to the starting point. Who's there? Why are you alone? I'm sick and tired of those spoiled kids. I want to go home. How did you leave your group? I told them I needed to go to the bathroom and then I left. What should we do? The rule is boys and girls must be in separate groups. But we can't leave her here alone either. She said she wanted to go home. Let her go then. No, we can't do that. She's a girl. I will be embarrassed if I leave her alone here. That's right. We have to have some sympathy. We will take care of her. Where are we going? We're going straight. Let's go. Looks like it's her that's taking care of us. All right. Let's go again. I saw a Batutut. Here you go again. You could be cursed. I saw its shadow just now. It ran away among the trees. Only a Batutut can do that. If you want to believe it, go ahead. Which way should we go now? If I'm not mistaken it's north. That's the direction you're looking for? Have we gone north? Yes, but my guidance was the sun. It's getting harder to see the sun now in the middle of the forest. All right then. Let's walk faster. Be careful. It's slippery. Let's go. It's a swift current. There. The in-between post. Let's go. Gosh. I have to go pee first. - You want to escape, huh? - You can't accuse him like that. No. He purposely took us here so he could escape. Am I right? Come on, just admit it. You've found the in-between post. Just go ahead. I have to go to the RC exhibition. I'm sorry, Rusdi. I'm an RC racer. I'm not a Scout. Baron. Sandra starts to bore me. I better go home. After exposing my secret, now you want to go with me? But you don't know this city, do you? I know the way around here so you can get to the exhibition faster. Okay. But we go our separate ways after that. I'll go with you. I want to go home too. The girls are not being fair. No! This is not right! I had to do all the tasks by myself. The others just had fun and played. That's the wayward behavior of individual Scouts! Baron, you remember how happy your dad and mom were when you joined this camp? That's the problem. They're happy. I'm not. But you were happy when we won the contest. My journal book says we have to be the best! Not everything has to be in your journal. - It has to! - No! My parents not asking for my opinion about moving here, is that written there? Sindai having to do all the tasks by herself, is that written there? About your father. Whatever! Who wants to join me? My book. Let's continue the contest. Maybe he's right. Maybe that book is useless anyway. Why did you give him the map? Rusdi needs it more than we do. We'll just follow this road. What now? Batutut again? If we go to the heart of the forest, then we can see it. For now, I don't think it will show up. I think it's the in-between post for another camp. The Scout Leader looks different. Hey. Where are you from? How can you find this area? Where do you come from? Come here. - Hey! - Let's get them. They know our base. You said it would be easy. You said we'd just had to find north. Is that a north tree? Rusdi was right. We shouldn't have cheated in the first place. Sindai, give me the book. - This is it. - What is that? Moss lives in a humid place with no direct sunlight. I don't see moss here. That means the sun is over there. And that's east. If that way is east... north is over there. Batutut. - Don't run! - Run, fast! - Rusdi. - Don't run. Come on. Come on! - Let's go. - Where do you think you're going? You guys are noisy. - Arif. - Arif. You watch them here. I want to negotiate with them. I'm warning you. If you can't guard little boys, you'll pay for it. I'll be back in half an hour. Yes. Over there! You have to admit, Baron, that book was useful. MEMBERS OF EAGLE GROUP. ONCE AN EAGLE, ALWAYS AN EAGLE. ANTON: A BRAVE SCOUT, BUT LACKS COURAGE. ALDI: A BRAVE SCOUT, BUT LACKS PATIENCE. BARON: A SMART SCOUT, BUT SELFISH AND DOESN'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS YET. Enough now. Let's go. Come on. Come on. You're right, Aldi. Rusdi was right all along. We have to win the Markas Bintang contest and give him the Bintang Utama Scout title. What's wrong with you? Remember your RC exhibition! I can do RC anytime. But once an eagle, always an eagle. I will go and find Rusdi and Anton. Ouch. Something is wrong. Who are they, Rusdi? They're probably the timber or wildlife thieves. There. Look. Baron, we have to get help. We will make a trap. Sindai, get me the big branch. Aldi, let me borrow your watch. What do you want with it? Just give it to me, hurry! Give me a hand. Is that your tummy growling? Yes, Rusdi. What's that? What? That light over there. Morse code. Baron. Come on, Anton. Let's roll on the floor. - Roll? - Yes. Hold this for me. Funnel. Itchy! You're acting like an orangutan. You want me to hang you on the tree? I have a rash. Let me go! It will get worse! It's contagious too! Yol! - Hey. - Come here! - What's going on here? - This kid is sick. If we don't separate them, the other one will get sick too. You separate them then. Separate them. Watch out. Keep your distance. Let's call Arif. No. It's just a small problem. Just wait a minute. Did you hear that? - They're out. - Hurry. You should've been more patient. Yol! Yol! Don't try anything funny. Yol! - Ouch. - Yol! - Where are you? - I'm here. Ouch! Have mercy on me! Aldi. Their leader will be here shortly. He has a gun too. - What are you doing now? - I will cross the river. I will get help. Don't worry. I'm very good at swimming. Be careful, Aldi. Let's go. Keep going. Sindai is missing. She said she had to pee but hasn't come back since. Anyone seen one of our members? One of the members was so clumsy and she hasn't returned. Sindai. Look out! Yol! Who are you? Who are you? Batutut. Adit. You go and search that way. Stop! Isn't that Aldi? Sindai. Hey. Eagle. You have to be punished for breaking the rules. Escaping from the contest area... But you're great Scouts! The winner of the best group. Group... Tiger! The members of Tiger will receive the Bintang Utama Scout award. They are... Sorry for this. Don't worry. Sindai. Come on. What's wrong with you? Nothing. I just noticed that you have nice hair. You want it, don't you? It's written in your book. You want to be named the best Scout and be eligible to join the national jamboree. We still have next year. But, the best or not, I'm still a Scout, right? Friends like all of you? I can't find that in my journal. Right, Baron? But following your journal once in a while is fine too. Eagle! Get him! We need to help someone. Eagle, standby! SEE YOU ON THE NEXT ADVENTURE
