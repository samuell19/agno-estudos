Have another drink before you go! No mate, I'm late already. How's Betsy doing? Oh, you know, any moment now. Ta-da, merry Christmas, be good! Merry Christmas, Rick. Merry Christmas, Ned. Hello, mum. Hello, love, you're late. Yeah, one or two on the way home. Here we are, Christmas dinner... ...and a bonus: a hundred fags. - Lovely! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, in your condition, watching all that brutality. Baby'll be born with two heads! Oh, little... Turn it up, Ricky! Oh Jim, when are we gonna get a place of our own? As soon as we can, love. Matt'll be here soon, I'd better get the supper on. Wotcha, Nobby! Happy Christmas, Matt. Thanks mate, same for you. Come home and have a drink, Nobby. I'm late. And me get the blame for it? No, thanks. What's all this about you being in trouble with the union? Ah, that's nothing. Wouldn't you stop behaving like the bleedin' bosses? I've paid me dues, that's all. Anyhow, if I get kicked out of the docks, I can always come and join you doing the cues. You could do worse. Great big chap like you? Strong man act. Always goes down big. Go down big with Lil, it would. Blimey, she'd kill me. Well, give her my best, and the kids too. Thanks, mate. There you go. Hey, Ricky! Ricky! This is meant to be Christmas, not a bleedin' funeral. You just don't appreciate good music. Well, there's more music in this! It's Christmas, come on! Come on, Ricky! It didn't like it... It's kicking. That's it, my boy, give her a boot! Put the old leather in! Oh, he is an all! Kick your uncle, would ya? I'll have to put you in your place, sonny Jim! Oh! That's enough, Ricky. You alright, Beth? Course she's alright! Yeah, I'm fine. There you are, see? Yeah, we do them tough in Bethnal Green! Bethnal Green! Well, they've seen you alright, mate. What's wrong with Bethnal Green? Will you never stop saying that? I can't wait to get out of it! Nothing wrong with it. Me and Jim just want a house of our own, that's all. Yeah, well I want a life of me own. There's other places in the world, you know? I know you don't think so, Mum. I know you think there's just Hackney Road and the Kingdom of Heaven, but there are other places. There's Greek islands and blue seas and hot sun. There's burning deserts where you could die of thirst in half an hour. Oh that's lovely, that is. I'd love that. Yeah, well I want to see them. I wanna be independent, get around, see the world. Look, Bethnal Green's alright. Yeah, if you burnt the whole place down. That's an idea, Ricky! Let's have a bonfire! The burning of Bethnal Green! Right, where do we start? On these bleedin' things. I've always hated the sight of them anyway! Ricky, no! Ricky! Hurrah! The burning of Bethnal Green! That's Christmas and... What's going on here, then? Ricky! Run around quick?and phone for the ambulance! - Is she starting? - Yeah, it's starting! Somebody do something! Ricky, the ambulance! ...Jesus Christ her little child. - He don't do much, do he? - I know? Cor, Blimey! What do you expect him to do, turn summersaults? When you've brought up to kids like I have, my girl, you'll know... Oh, I know, Mum. But it is a bit of a let down, innit? Well, let down or not I want ten of them. Ten! No less. You'll have to go it alone, Beth. I'm not getting married just to produce grandchildren for this old bag. Oh, thanks very much. That's enough of that now, Ricky. In fact, I'm not getting married at all, mate. I want to get around a bit, see the world. Well. Let us now when you're going. We could do with that extra room now. Yeah, we can't go on cramming onto mamma's back room forever, Jim. We've got to get a place of our own, now. I know. Now don't you worry about it, we'll find something. Here we are. All this lot's got to get away before you've finished, I don't want nothing left down here tonight, alright? Sorry, Mr. Bunting. Think I'll have a cup of char now Bunting's up the spout. Oh, give us a hand, will you? Got me lines of demarcation, ain't I? That ain't what I heard from Sally Seymour! You're not supposed to come in here! Oh, really! You men, you're all the same. You're only after one thing. Sally, that's not true. I like you, honest I do. Tell you what. Why don't you come dance with me Saturday night? Ricky, I'd love to! I can't come Saturday, though. What about Friday? What's wrong with Saturday? Got someone else, have you? No, Ricky, claro que no. You're messing me about, aren't you? No I'm not Ricky, I just never knew you felt like... Alright, I don't. If that's the way you want it. Oh, Ricky... You make up your mind, that's all. Ricky! And you can cool off in here for a bit. Ricky! Ricky, let me out! Ricky! What are you doing down here? Oh, Mr. Bunting! Came over all queer, sir. Sally's going to get me some aspirins. Well, you should get a first aid if you're feeling unwell. If I catch you down here again out of break hours, you'll be reported. Yes, sir. Sorry, Mr. Bunting. Well, that's tall! He's gonna report me if he finds me down here again. No, he won't report you. I don't know. He looked real nasty to me. Yeah. Sounded a bit sour, didn't he? Poor Eric. Poor Eric? So he's in on the old slap and tickle stakes too, is he? What sort of joint are you running down here, anyway? Oh, hello Matt. Hello, Nobby. How's your Betsy, then? Well, well, Ricky Flint. Now, what a coincidence. Hello Charlie. Pug. Evening, Mr. Flint. - Got a minute? - Yeah, sure. - Still playing the cues, then, Nobby? - Yeah. - How's business, then? - Seen it worse. Alright, alright. I'm working on it. Anyway, what's all the rush? When Jack makes up his mind to do a job he likes to get on with it. Can you fix the alarm? Yeah. Leave that to me. I've got the whole circuit planned. Hope you're not going to let us down, Ricky boy. Come on, let's get back. No, don't take umbrage, old chap. Besides, I ain't finished yet. Alright, what then? Well, Jack reckons it's time we got the transport in. I thought he was going to nick a lorry on the night. A ringer? You're a very funny fellow, Ricky boy. No, Jack don't want a lorry that's crooked. Alright, who then? Well, now. Who do we know's got a lorry? You know, someone who could use a bit of readying. Like somebody who's old woman was in the pudding club. He'd never do it. There's 200 in it for somebody. Alright, I'll think about it. That's right boy, you have a good old think. - I said I'll think about it! - Alright, alright. Who's your bird? Looks a bit slaggy to me. She's alright. Not flash enough for Pug, I'd have thought. She's not for Pug. You weren't talking about no dogs. We were discussing the price of tarts, love. Oh, Blimey! A humourist. Yes, he's a very funny fellow, I keep telling him. What's good for the next, Pug? There's old Jack! Knocking back the old champagne and caviar there. Old capitalist! Hey, Jack! Do me a favour, will ya? Drop dead, will ya? As a favour! What's got into him? You know old Matt, he's crazy. You shut your mouth. Come on, Dad. What's got into you? He couldn't hear. Why do you want to go shouting at him like that for? Listen, he ought to be put down. I hate to see you having anything to do with him. I don't hardly know him. Ah well, let's forget Mr. Jack bloody Ellerman. Some people! Jack must be off his nut, having anything to do with the Flints. I've got to get a bet on. Pug? What's all this about trouble at the docks, then? I don't know. A man can hardly call his soul his own. The union's as bad as the bleedin' bosses. In the old days, a job was a job. And nobody told you when to work or how to work. Yeah, most weeks you was out of work. Well, so that was life. But at least it was your own life and you were in charge of it. I'm getting out, son. What are you gonna do? Oh, I'm looking around. What does Mum say? Oh! Here... Number four! Number four! Come on, six! Come on, six! I won, see? I won. You were second to last! - Well, where were you? - Last. What did you say your name was? Catherine? Miss Donovan to you. I'll call you Cat. Alley Cat. You go to hell. Miss Alley Cat Donovan. Mind it, I'll scratch you, mate! How did they get like that? Sewing, that's what I do. What, and you're hands get like that? Sure. We sell leather. Leather coats and that. - Where's Charlie? - Who knows... - I thought you was with him. - I'm not with nobody. Fancy free, eh? Too true, I am. Fancy free. Right, I'll take you home then. Well? That'll teach you. I'm not that easy! It's hard to make a go at the transport business. If I got an A licence I'd be laughing. I could carry anybody's goods anywhere. Can't you get one? Takes money. The Transport Commission put up lawyers to stop you. Takes cash to fight them. I've been saving for it to try it, you know? Here, don't tell Betsy, though! She'll want to put it all towards getting a place of our own. Don't worry. I might be able to help you with something. Go on. Yeah. There's a job you could do. - Yeah? - Only would take you one night. That'll be of great help, that will. Well, I don't know. 200 quid. Alright. What's it all about? It's the factory. Now we"re gonna do it. Charlie Batey, Puggy Hicks and me. Jack Ellerman's the boss. We want you and your lorry to transport. A lot of fags, it's big money. Yeah, but how are you gonna... How are you gonna do it? Ain't there a watchman? No. But the place is lousy with burglar alarms. It's my job to fix them. It's why I've been working there the past three months. And I get 200 quid? It'll help you get that licence, won't it? I don't know Ricky, I don't know? I mean, once you get started with that sort of thing, there's no end to it, is there? It's just the one job, Jim. One job, that's all. Then we break off! Finish. It's just one night's work. That's all I'm in it for. Just enough money to get me independence. OK, Ricky, OK. I can't say no to an offer like that, can I? That's it, mate. Drink up. I expect the balloon's gone up at home. Dad's telling Mum about leaving the docks. Well, Ricky's been telling me about it, Matt. Hard to know. I reckon you're right. Yeah? thanks Jim. I'm with you, Dad. We both want the same thing, I reckon. Do we, Ricky? I wonder. - Well? - Get stuck in, eh? Poor old Lil. Well don't stand there, it'll get cold. No you don't, Matt. You don't sit there no more. How do you mean? - It's the end of the table. - Well, this is where I sit! It's the end of the table. Ricky sits there now. He's paying for the food, so he sits there. Look, this is my place. Not anymore it ain't. You sit where I tell you. Where you tell me? He pays for the food. Since when have you told me what to do? Since when, eh? - Mum, I can't... - You keep out of this. Now, listen, Lil. You keep your mouth shut, I'm telling you. You don't tell me nothing no more, my friend. You chuck up your job? You just fling away your job? What rights have you got anymore? Now, listen. I don't know what's going one here. I don't know. Now. There'll have to be some changes, mate. We can't go on spending like we have been doing. Oh, don't worry, love. I'll soon get a job again. No problem. What's that for? You're not as young as you was, love. Oh, Matt... Don't worry, though. I'll soon get a job again. I'm not old. Got me strength. Don't worry. I'm not worrying, love. I'm just saying we have to cut down for a bit. Just for the time being. Here, the telly can go, for a start. No, we can keep that on. The telly can go. Just sits there jabbin' to itself in the corner. We'll be alright, Lil. Of course we will. I love you. Oi! Where's Cathy Donovan live? What do you want her for? 197! What are you gonna do to her, mister? Can we come watch? You could be with her! This where Cathy Donovan lives? You have me there, sir. I haven't seen her for the best part of a week. Ah, the poor girl. Why, what's happened? Well, the last I saw her, she was falling down a manhole. Old Montague Street it was. Must've been carried down the river by now. Go on down to Southend Pier, she's bound to pass there sometime. Ricky, darling! Simply too? too wonderful to see you! Well you don't look so hot yourself. Yeah. Want to come to the pictures tonight? I don't care, I don't mind. There's a good one at the Odeon. There's a good one on at the Essoldo. I wanna go to the Odeon. Well, hard luck. I wanna go to the Essoldo. Here, tell you what. You give me the money, then I can go to the Odeon. We can meet after if you like. I should, coco! - We going to the Essoldo? - No. No! Meet you at the Essoldo. Half past six. I'll be at the Odeon. Don't come in none of your kid brother's cast-offs neither. You old rag bag! Terrible woman to have for a daughter. Seats upstairs. Four and six, please. Here! What's the matter with you? Ain't your lip working after what I've done to it? I bet you're scared of me. Yeah. What's it gonna be this time? ...I'm gonna get out the back I'm gonna get out the back... I'm saving for a cruise I'm giving up me booze. I'm gonna get out and sing and shout 'Cause I just wanna be free. I'm gonna get out the back See the world. You don't see life with having a wife And kids all round the place. You'll be a mental case You'll have to join the race. Cause everyone's waiting for council flats To list this off of my loan. That's quite a little flown When old age is creeping on. I'm gonna get out the back I'm gonna get out the back. I'm saving for a cruise I'm giving up me booze. I'm gonna get out and sing and shout 'Cause I just wanna be free. I'm gonna get out the back See the world. - Jolly good! Well done, Ricky! - Thanks, Mum. Thought you said you could sing. You're a funny one, you are! Yeah. I die laughing. Drinks, too. Like a fish. Oh I think I'll just gather the... Want a penny? Less sorts from you, mate. Here, I'll come with you. That beer didn't half go through you. Charming. Hello Jack, what are you doing here? Just passing. Hey Jack! Do me a favour will you? Drop dead, will you? As a favour. Here, was that my girl that was with you? She ain't your girl. Charlie, go and ask Mr. Flint, Sr. to come have a drink with us. I don't know that it's very wise to get involved with an intelligent girlfriend at this stage of the game. I'm not getting involved. Good boy. - Jack. - Yeah? He don't like you. Tell me something new. You wanna drink with him, he says, you go and drink with him. He's an absolute geezer, your old man. Hi, Matt. Nice to see you again. Let's go and have a drink. Look, I've got a drink, I've got a seat, and I'm happy. Sit down, Nobby. This isn't the king of bleedin' Zanzibar. I think I'll go in. An old friend, Matt? No friend of mine. I want to help you. Help? What help do I need from you, mate? I hear you're out of work. I'm going into business on me own. At your age? Talk sense. Come work with me, Matt. Listen, don't you talk to me like that. What's going on? Nobby! What's going on? He'll show you something. - What are you talking about? - You'll see... Alright, then Come outside and I'll show you. Nobby! What's Matt up to? He'll show that Jack Ellerman he don't need no job. You just wait and see. Lil. Stop Matt making a fool of himself. If Matt wants to make a fool of himself, that's his lookout. What's he up to, then? I don't know. Hello, Charlie. Ricky... A right case, your old man. Let's have a look. My life! Oh, what's the silly old slob up to now, then? So you've got nothing then, Matt? Who's your tailor? Come on then, Matt! You've got nothing to lose but your chains. Come on, Lil. Let's go and have a drink. No thanks, Jack. I won't. Well, Lil. What do you think of it? He acts fine! It'll go great out West. What do you mean, out West? Matt's joining me, we're doing the cues. Busking! You can take real money. It's a great act. It's begging. Oh, no it ain't. I've been at it for twenty years and owned every penny. I'm sorry, Nobby, I didn't mean you. It's alright for you. But Matt's different. He's a docker. Not now. Not no more, I'm not. Come on, Lil. I need a wet after this. Look, we've paid good money to see worse acts than mine. Oh, it's a great act! It needs a bit of polishing. I'm tired. Good. So am I. Here, come with me to this place I know. We can sit down and be comfortable there. What do you mean? Well, just sit down, you know. There's this place, round the corner. Come round the corner with you? Whatever for? What's the matter with you? You balmy or something? What do you want me to do, Ricky? What do you want to do to me, Ricky? What do you want to do to me? You want to make love to me? Oh, you are a noisy cow. What's this? Milady's boudoir? Here, I'm not having no rats around watching. Cats. That's alright, then. Loads of cats round here. Means there's no-one else around, anyway. I'm late! What's all this, then? What's all this? Eviction notices! The whole bloody street. That's what's all this. See what it says. Slum clearance. Calling my house a slum... It's done us alright! Oh I don't know, they'll find us something. These new flats are alright. Flats... Here, Ma. They're pre-fabs! They're instant houses. Instant slums, more like. They might give us a place of our own, Jim. Oh, what a home. They've got no right to chuck us out at a minute's notice. Two months, love. What's two months when we've lived in a place for thirty years? It's not good enough. There ought to be something we can do about it. Yeah, petition. What? Get up a petition. That's it! That's it! We'll get up a petition from everyone in the street. Everyone in Clare Street. Here, Matt! Matt! I want you! - Ta. - See you. - Alright, Al? - Hello, Ricky. Give you a bob for it. - Half a crown. - Tenner, then. Make it a bob, then. Little bastard! Here, how much is he? Canary? Twenty five bob. Do us a favour! How much is that one? Two pound. Bit fat, ain't he? He ain't fat, he's plump. He's been well looked after. He's breast-fed, that one. Give you a quid for him. Pound for him? I wouldn't insult him. Two pound. He's not worth two pound! But I tell you what. You toss in this mouldy old canary here, I'll give you two pound ten the two. Make it three quid. I wouldn't take them off your hands, ...but it so happens that I do it for my kid brother, who's deaf, dumb and blind. Fifty bob the two. Alright, go on. Alright, that makes it ten bob for the canary. Oi! Oi! Come back here, will ya? Wouldn't try that game if I was you. Oh, ain't he lovely, though? Give us a kiss for him. I prefer pigeons myself. What are you doing tonight? They're bigger, you know? I don't know yet. They makes better eatin' when you gets tired of 'em. Here, he looks a bit malty to me, that one. Well, so would you if you were shut up in a cage all day. Why don't you let him out, then? You don't get that trouble with pigeons. Would you mind if I did, Ricky? No, he's yours. You do what you like with him. Come on. He doesn't seem to want to come out. Course he does. Lift him up. Mind your hands. Go on, let him go, then. He's frightened. Nah, give him a push. He'll be killed! No, he won't. He's free now? He'll be alright. He's free. What a way to earn a living. Must be strong. Now then! Course it's a fake. Course it isn't! Well, of course it is! Shut up. Oh, maybe knows who they are! You heard what I said? There's no need to be rude. Alright Jim, you know your bit. Get your lorry there. When we've loaded up you get it back to my place. Help unload and lose yourself.. Right. Now it's up to little Ricky here. Get out of here. I'm just gonna get his feed. - Evening, Mr. Ellerman. - Hello, Betsy. Is that your kid, Jim? Blimey! He's ugly, ain't he? You watch what you're saying about my nephew. Uncle Ricky, then? It's got four legs and a snout, I suppose it's human, eh? Oh, thanks! You bloody well shut up! Now, now then. It's only Charlie's sense of humour. Don't take no notice of him, Betsy. It's just his idea of a joke. Well, it's not mine. What do you want to know people like them for? Well, Jack brought him. What's he here for? What do they want here, anyway? For some furniture. Wardrobes and stuff, shipping. Yeah, well a funny time of night to come about it, that's all I can say. That's business, innit? Oh, Jim... When are we gonna get a place of our own? It won't be long, Betsy. Come on. You pop up to bed. I gotta get back in there, they're waiting. I won't be long, love. Wouldn't be the same, would it? Coming home to a block of flats. You sent in the petition? Couldn't do anything, could they Matt? Not now, knowing how we feel. That's what you think, love. It's nothing to do with us, we just live here. Remember when we first came here? Yeah. A house, nothing to put in in it. Except the old iron bed. What's wrong with that? That's what we wanted, wasn't it? Oh, Matt... We've come on a bit since then, what with the kids and that. Yeah, and the old man on the street, eh? I didn't mean it, love. You always was a mad devil, I ought to be used to you by now. Here, what's all this, then? Jack Ellerman's car. Just ring me, Ricky. When we're all set, just ring me. Right you are, Jack. What's all this, then? Hello, Dad. Did you ask this lot in? Well, they're mates of mine. I'm very fond of your son, Matt. Look, I told you before. Keep away from my boy. I don't want him to have anything to do with you. - You're not telling me what I... - I am telling you! Now, now. Come on, Matt. What's got into your old man, Lil? You think you can do what you like, don't you? Don't you, Jack? You think you can just come and go as you please, it don't matter. I'm the great Jack bloody Ellerman! Well, this is someone who's not taking it. Look, I just came around to see your son. I live here, don't I? Jack's a friend of mine! I've known you too long, Jack Ellerman. Just keep away from my family. I try to help you, Matt. Who needs your help? Who needs your help, eh? You do. I do? That's a laugh! When I want any help from you I'll let you know. Don't you worry. You've got to think of Lil. So that's it, is it? I'll take care of her, don't you worry. Alright, Matt. Let's leave it, eh? No, no you don't. No, no you don't! Let go! Trying to drag her into this? Matt. Dad! What did you do to him? What did you do to him? Nothing, Lil. I didn't touch him. Come on, got to get him to the hospital. Get him in the car. They're taking their time, ain't they? It's half an hour since Mum went in. They know their business. - Your dad's a strong man. - You're damn right, he is. I told you not to come round to our place, didn't I? - We used to be friends. - Yeah, looks like it. What's been going on between you two, anyway? Me and your dad used to be friends. Now he hates me. - That's what's going on. - Oh, come off it. - Alright. He was jealous. - Jealous? You must be joking. I was in the money. Dad don't want that sort of money. Maybe he thinks your mum did. Mum? He knew I was after Lil before they were married. Well, they got married. - I accepted it. - Bloody well had to, didn't you? Perhaps. Anyway, I'd have liked to have helped him. - I want to help you, Ricky. - Will you do something for me, Jack? Just stay away from me after this. I don't want nothing more to do with you, see? - Mr Flint? - Yeah, that's right. I'm afraid I have bad news for you, Mr Flint. Your father's dead. He had a cerebral hemorrhage. A stroke. If he'd have lived he'd have probably been paralyzed and bedridden. That would have been hard for an active, strong man. Yeah, that's right. He was a strong man. I'll see you. Jack, I lost money on that one. Oh, I'm sorry about that, Sammy. I was wrong there. I lost money on it, too. Eh? Bad luck. I had a century on it with the book. What do you wanna come and lose money up here for then? Keep the odds long. Right, then! I've been taking your phoney tips, too! Ricky... I've delayed things a bit because of Matt. But now we've got to get moving. It suits me. They usually test the alarms beginning of the week. I'll get on to you when they've done it. Good boy. Well, Ricky, you'll soon be in the money. This'll be your sort of place. You belong here. I wont belong anywhere, mate. When I've got my bit I'm getting out on me own somewhere. I don't want no belonging to places... ...or people. What about your girlfriend? The skinny bird. Never you mind about her. I don't mind. Charlie might. What do you mean, Charlie? Ain't nothing to her. They're around together. They're here tonight. What? Saw them down below. By the rails somewhere. Sit down, Ricky. What's she to you, anyway? Yeah, that's right. She don't mean nothing. Catherine Donovan here? Want your smalls done, love? Just leave 'em off, anything to oblige! Come and give us a hand? - No, I wanna talk to you. - What about? Well, can't you come outside for a bit? What, and lose me sink? What do you wanna talk about? Yeah, what do you wanna talk to her about, mister? - Look. What are you doing tonight? - Oh, I'm going out tonight, Ricky. - What about tomorrow? - Where you going tonight? Out. - What, with Charlie Batey? - Maybe. You going out with him again? So? You don't tell me what do, Ricky. I do what I like. You wanna watch it, Cat. You might finish up in that water. Just you try, that's all. Just you try! Right. - You going out with Charlie Batey? - Mind your own bloody business! Here you are, love. Come on, let's go. I've finished me washing. What's the matter? I don't know. I feel so... ...lonely after. Well, you wanna get married? - Do you mind? - Oh, I don't know. It's what most girls think about. Getting married? ...and having kids. What, and end up like me mum? All yours if it comes to that. Draggled old housewives. I should've thought that was just the job for you. Find some steady, dependable bloke. Like that Charlie Batey, then! You go to hell! I'd rather marry Charlie than you. Alright! Let's forget it! Hey, Cat. Cat, come back! - I didn't mean it. - Well, I did. No-one ever takes any notice. Testing? - As you know. Although the alarms go off all over no-one ever takes any notice. Cor! Why don't they shut that row? Hello, yes? Ellerman here. Hello, Jack. They just tested the alarm. Good. The sooner we can get it done the better, then. When can you do your bit, Ricky? I can fit the dud fuse in the alarm circuit dinner time. Good boy. Right. We'll do it tonight. - Everything's laid on. - Tonight? - Well, yeah. I suppose so. - What do you mean, you suppose? OK, OK. Tonight it is. I'll tell Jim. Right. See you Ricky. So long, Jack. Sally! Hello, Ricky. Come for a drink dinner time, eh? - Me birthday. - Oh, many happy returns. Ta. Drink over the road, then, eh? Alright, then. See you there. Sally? Sally! Sal? There you are. I thought I'd missed you. Well, you have. Hope you might join in me in a glass of beverage? No, thank you. I'm just gonna make myself a cup of tea. Very nice, too. I'll join you. Got me sandwiches. Here! You're not supposed to come in here. Oh, Eric. You men are all the same! You're only after one thing. Eric... Ricky! What are you doing here? I was coming out to see you. Wanna talk to you. It's on. We're doing it tonight. What's up? I can't do it. Look, I've thought about it and thought about it, and I've had a hell of a time over it... ...but I can't do it. You can't back out! Not now. It's all fixed for the night. - You got to go through with it! - I can't! God knows how I'm gonna get me licence or a house. But I'd be much worse off the other way. And you will too, you know? Everything's ready. I've done my bit on the fuse and now you say no. Don't come get all moral with me! Look, I'll drive your bleeding lorry myself! No. The lorry stays out of it. I'm sorry I took so long to decide, but... ...well, there it is. Do you want a lift? No, thanks. I don't like being let down, Ricky. It wouldn't do for anybody to get away with it. Won't make no difference, Jack. I'll be there with the lorry. I'll drive it myself. Alright. Too late to change things now. You be there with the lorry. Jim's backed out. We'll see about that. Don't now, Charlie. Don't want anybody we can't rely on. - Ricky will be there with the lorry. - We'll be one short. - I'll come myself. - Well well! I'll phone them to put up the old red carpet, then. What's up? - What's going on with you? - Nothing. What do you keep looking at the time for? Look, if I'm boring you, mate...! No, it's not like that. Hang around. I want you. Oh, you do, do you? What's the matter with you tonight? Nothing. Something's up, isn't it? I know something's on, from Charlie. If you have anything more to do with that bastard I'll kick your teeth in. Oh, charming. Such nice things you say to me. You're the one who ought to stay away from Charlie, if you ask me. Well, I'm not asking you, am I? - Why don't you mind your own business? - Well, your always minding mine. Who do you think you are, anyway? My boyfriend or something? That'll be the day. Yeah, that'll be the day alright. Cat. Cat! Keep watching. Now let's see if you've done your job properly. Gloves. Hadn't forgotten. This place is cleared everyday. All the stuff's on the third floor, ready to go on a lift. Right. Pug! No, leave Pug there on watch. You never know with Ricky. And you do with Pug? Don't want a murder on our hands. Pug. Anybody comes down the alley, use it. Bastard Ricky. It's a copper! You chicken little bastard! Come on, let's get out of here. Over the top. Come on. OK, now. Get lost. I'll get that bleedin' Ricky if it's the last thing I do! Jim, what is it? The lorry! It's on fire. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky, the tank will blow up! Ricky, stand back! Suits you. Don't make me laugh, for God's sake. How are you, Ricky? Never felt better. Hurts a bit, now it's healing. Your mum says you'll be out soon. She'll be in a new flat by then! Yeah, I know. Cat... Look, I wanted to see you. Sit down. I don't know what... my face gonna look like when they're done with it. It didn't look too good before. Will it... Will it matter to you, Cat? Well, I can't say what I'll feel til I see it, can I? I don't want it to make any difference. Your face don't matter that much. That's the way I feel now? But I might feel different when I see it. I hope I don't, but you can't help the way you feel, can you? - What you been doing? - Nothing much. You been going out with Charlie while I've been here? I've been out with him. Cat! You're not still going out with him, are you? After all this? I don't want to sit around doing nothing, do I? Yeah, but not Charlie Batey? Why not Charlie Batey? I'm free, aren't I? We're not engaged, are we? I'm sorry, Ricky. I couldn't lie to you. Just get well soon, love. - Hello, Ricky. - Hello Jim, boy. Sorry I'm late. Here, I brought you some fruit and magazines. Oh, ta mate. Your mum sent her love. She couldn't come because of the move. Tomorrow, is it? Yeah. I borrowed a lorry for it. Poor old Lil. You should've heard her weeping and wailing. Jim, what about the insurance? Are they paying up? They will do, yeah. Enough for a new lorry? Well, it would be, but... I'm turning in the transport lark. I'll get a steady job. Insurance will pay the deposit on the house. It's what Betsy's always wanted. Jim, I'll be out of here soon. Then we'll have a go at Batey and his mob. They're not getting away with it. No, Ricky. It's best left alone. I felt like blue murder at first, I tell you. I went round looking for them but they was lying low, I reckon. And then Betsy was at me. She says that if it got out that it wasn't an accident then it might upset the insurance. I suppose she's right. Just you get out of here, son. Don't seem the same without you. - Bye, there you go. - Ta, Jim. Doesn't it look dirty now all the things have gone? It's hard to believe we've lived here all these years. It's my home... Oh, Mum. The flat's so nice and bright. Come on, then. Let's get the old kip down. I'll get the blankets. Thanks, Mum. Come on, Mum. You'll be more comfy there. - Cab's full of stuff. - Alright. Alright. I'll just lock up. Don't bother! There's nothing left to lock up. Ricky! Come on in, now. Betsy's come to see you. - Ricky, love. - Give us your bag. It's nice here, mum. It's not the same as having your own front door. I know, it's terrific. Look, you can see St. Paul's! It's all very well for them that like's it, I suppose. Oh, blimey! I've got something on the stove. Poor old Mum. She's never satisfied. How's the landed gentry, then? Now you've got a house of your own. It's nice, really. We've got a bit of garden, our own telly. Jim's job's alright at the factory, too. Oh, but? - Oh, come off it! Don't say you're not satisfied, after all that trouble I went through! You're awful, Ricky. No, the house is nice, really. Trees all down the street and that. Just a bit lonely, that's all. What about the pub, then? The nearest pub's a mile away! Went there a couple of times. Jim wanted to meet people, he said. But it was all so new and shiny. Guvnor wasn't very friendly. And there was hardly anybody else in it. So far away from anywhere... Just some kids on motorbikes. What do you do in the evenings, then? Sit and look at telly. It's funny how you think you know the people you watch on it. I even write to them sometimes. You're really going mad. Writing to the telly? They'll put you in the loony bin! Oh, shut up! Now then, you two. Rabbin' already? Have a nice cup of tea. No thanks, Mum. I'll be back later. I've got something to do. Tada. Bye, Bet. Well, if it ain't uncle Ricky then. I didn't know he was out. Out? Been inside. Carved a blonde or something, I think. What's the matter with his face? Gets me... I like it. You go for anything nasty, don't you? I'm looking for Charlie. I'll reckon he'll be looking for you, too, mate. - I should start running if I was you. - Yeah? Where is he? - Might find him in the Pushing Arms. - That'll do. - I'll come with you. - Me too! Are you potty? Alright, alright. Why do you come here? I hate this place. I like it. Oh, why did I come out with you? Ricky! Hello, Ricky boy. I told you not to come here, didn't I? Break it up. Break it up, now. Break it up. Alright. Bring up Flint. Hello, Mum. Flint. Your mother's offered to stand bail for you. If you fail to appear at Old Street Magistrate's Court at 10am tomorrow ...she'll lose her money. You understand? Yes. Sign for your things. You'll find all your personal possessions there. Except for the flick knife, which is the subject of the charge. I'm sorry, Mum. You were all I had left, Ricky. Now you've gone. Just a layabout and a thief, too. What have I got left? I used to have your dad, but he's gone now. Betsy and Jim have gone. The house has been broken down. What have I got left? You've still got me. What do you wanna talk about being free for? I never wanted it. I was always glad to have responsability. Well, that's life, ain't it? Anything of value ties you down and stands to reason. I never wanted to be free, but you all did. And in the end, I'm the only one that's free. I've got no responsabilities now. I've got no ties. I've got nothing. I'm free. Look at me... Free. Flint. You evidently started this fight. And the police found you with a knife in your hand. Wasn't mine, sir. Yes, I know. You've told us that. And witnesses have stated the knife was Batey's. Nonetheless, the use of this weapon makes this a very serious matter. What was this fight about? Well, it was about a girl, sir. - Miss Donovan? - Yes, sir. I see. And why were you fighting about her? We was just fighting, that's all. Flint, answer my question. Why were you fighting? Well, it's like this, sir. She's my girl... ...and we've been going out a long time. I've been away, I've been stuck in hospital. And while I've been away, Batey's been seeing her and taking her out and that. Well, I got a bit choked off with it and wanted to sort him out, see? Yes, but Batey says that Miss Donovan is his girl and that your attack was unprovoked. What do you say to that? Well, that's not true, sir. I see. Well, if what you say is true it puts the matter in a different light. Can you prove any legitimate relationship between yourself and Miss Donovan? We was gonna get married, sir. We was engaged and we was gonna get married. That's a lie, sir. This isn't something you've just made up on the spur of the moment, is it? No, sir. It is. He just made that up, sir! Quiet, Batey. Is Miss Donovan here? She's outside, sir. I thought she might be needed as a witness. Call Catherine Donovan. Miss Donovan, are you acquainted with the accused, Flint? Yeah. And is there any relation between you and him? Yeah. Would you describe yourself as 'his girl'? Remember, you are on oath. Yeah, I'm his girl. Is there anything more than that? Are you... engaged to be married? Yeah. We're engaged to be married. Thank you, Miss Donovan. You may stand down. Thank you. Well, Flint. I have a report on you here. You have no previous convictions. Your school record is good. And I have also a good report of you from your employers, Coolstream Cigarettes. I believe the evidence that the knife was Batey's. On the other hand, it is quite clear that you started the fight. The fact that you are engaged to Miss Donovan does seem, however, to indicate an extenuating circumstance. I'm going to be very lenient with you, therefore. And I hope you will take good advantage of it. Get married... ...and settle down. I bind you over to keep the peace for a year and you will pay three pounds cost. Thank you, sir. As for you, Batey... It was great of you to say that, Cat. Fine it makes me look! An engaged girl going out with another man while her fianc? is in hospital... I suppose we'll have to get married now. Don't wanna be had up for perjury. Marvelous, innit? Seeing as how we hate each other. I don't hate you, Cat. I love you. - I wanna marry you. - Oh, don't talk wet. Charming! You really want to marry me? You really love me? Just said so, didn't I? How many more times? Is this a proposal? Yep. Well, OK. I don't mind. Right. - Where are we going? - Where'd you think? Where are you taking me? What do you want to do to me? You want to make love to me? I'm gonna find myself a place to go... I'm gonna find myself a girl to love... We'll go out walking hand in hand without a care... ...I've got a feeling dreams come true someday, somewhere. I'm just a boy, ...who's looking for... ...a place to go... ...where I'll be free... Perhaps someday... ...I'll find a girl... ...who's looking for a place to go like me.
