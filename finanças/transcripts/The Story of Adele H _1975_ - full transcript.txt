"THE STORY OF ADELE H." "The story of Adele H. is true. It is about events that really happened... and people that really existed. " The year is 1863. For 2 years now, the United States... had been torn apart by a civil war. Will Great Britain recognize... the independence of the Southern Confederacy... and join in war against the Yankees? Since 1862, British troops have been stationed... in the Canadian town of Halifax... the capital of Nova Scotia... formerly the French Acadia. Halifax, is gripped by a kindoffever. The town's people are busy worrying... smuggling goods, and hunting Yankeespies. While at theport, the British authorities... maintain a close check on European passengers... disembarking from the Great Eastern... the huge steamship also known as the "Floating City. " - Good evening. Where are you from? - Liverpool. - Have you any papers? - No, I don't. - They let you embark in Liverpool? - Yes. - They let you embark in Liverpool? - They let me. If you had your papers in Liverpool, why haven't you got them now? They were taken away from me when I got to New York. Then we can't let you in. They may be in New York, but this is Halifax. We cannot let you in Halifax unless you've got papers. I don't know the rules. - I'm within my rights to search you. - Please don't. If you explain to me what they're for, maybe I won't have to. It will be up to my superior officer to decide whether they let you in or not. I need them, sir! - Right, miss, Hotel Hampstead. - Yes. Very good. - Give them to me. - No. Is there anymore? Whoa, boy, whoa. Hampstead. Is this the hotel? This is it, miss. No, I don't want to stay there. Apart from the Halifax, there's only the Atlantic... which is much too expensive. There isn't another hotel fit for a young lady to stay in. - You should go to a boarding house. - Oh, yes, please! "Room And Board" Good evening, Mrs. Saunders. I have a new lodger foryou, a nice young lady. Thankyou, Mr. O'Brien. - You can go in, miss. - Thank you. - Let me take your case, miss. - Thank you. - My name is Miss Lewly. - Come in, Miss Lewly. My name is O'Brien. I'm always about if you want me. - Thankyou very much. - Good night. "A. Lenoir - Notary Public" Good day, sir. My husband is a doctor, Dr. Lenormand in Paris. I've just arrived from France. That's the reason I was sent to you. I am very glad they did. You know, I like France very much. It will be a great pleasure for me to help you. What exactly is troubling you? I have a niece in France. I'm very fond of her. She's a rather romantic girl. During a visit to England... she fell in love with a British officer... Lieutenant Pinson of the 16th Hussars. There was even talk of marriage between them. Our family was not absolutely opposed to it... but because ofthe troubles in America... Lieutenant Pinson had suddenly to embark with his regiment... for Halifax. And since then, we've had no news of him at all... and my family wants me to find out what's happened to him. I find it very upsetting... because Lieutenant Pinson is of no interest to me. Lieutenant Pinson is of no interest to me. All I want is my niece's happiness. Well, I think you know everything now. So you want me to look for this lieutenant. Lieutenant Pinson. But in a discreet way. Yes, everyone has been saying so... even the other offiicers, that we have... a far better selection here than the military library... which is quite surprising, since we have far more difficulties... with the customs than you do. But anyway, I hope to have those 2 books... in 1 week or 2 at the most. Good, good. Thanks. Good-bye. Good-bye, Lieutenant. "Book Shop" Good day, Madam. Can I help you? - Yes, I'd like some paper. - Some note paper? No. I need a ream. I've a lot of writing to do. I thought I recognized the officer who just left. Wasn't it Lieutenant Pinson? That's right, yes. He's a good customer of mine. I had no idea he was in Halifax. Oh, he's not been here for long... but he's already got himself quite a reputation. Well, that's what they say in town. Really? That's what they say in town. And what else do they say? Oh, well, as far as I'm concerned... he's just another client. But apparently he's been running up a few debts. Anyway, he always pays cash here. Pardon me, Madam- Miss. Miss. May he be a relation of yours? Yes. He's my sister's brother-in-law. But I seldom see him. I'm not on good terms with my sister. I understand, yes. I'll take this one. Miss, I also have a lending library by subscription. Oh, really? But I could always lend you some books... - even if you don't subscribe. - Thank you. Good-bye. Good-bye, Miss. Good evening, Mrs. Saunders. Miss Lewly, would you share my supper? My husband's helping out tonight... as a waiter at the Officers' Club banquet. Will the English officers be there? Yes. After all, the banquet's in their honor. They're celebrating the arrival of the 16th Hussars. In that case, my cousin should be there. Your cousin? You have a cousin in Halifax? Yes. Lieutenant Pinson. I call him cousin, but we're not really related. We grew up together. He's the son of our village clergyman. To tell you the truth, he's been in love with me... since we were children. I never encouraged him. We lost touch years ago. But this could be an occasion to see him again. Perhaps I could give you a letter for him, Mr. Saunders... a letter to give him. Yes, of course. I'll go and write it now. Please wait a few minutes. Albert, my love... our separation has destroyed me. Since you've left, I've thought of you every day. I know you must be suffering as I am. I've received none of your letters... and I'm sure that mine never reached you. But today I'm here, Albert. I'm on the same side of the ocean as you are. Everything will begin anew. I know that soon your arms will be around me. I'm in the same city as you, Albert. I'm waiting for you. I love you. Your Adele. Oh, Miss, he must be a famous artist... the one who made these pictures. It was my brother. Do congratulate him. I don't know anybody who can get a likeness like that. Honestly, you'd say you were alive. Oh, what a lovely picture. Is that you? No. No, it's my older sister. Does she live in Europe? She died a long time ago. I'm sorry. Leopoldine drowned a few months... after our mother sketched this portrait. She was 19. She had just married. They were out taking a boat ride. Her husband died with her. Our father was away when it happened. He learned the news by chance from a newspaper. He nearly went mad with grief. And you... you must have been very unhappy. Leopoldine was adored by the whole family. How lovely she looks. Her husband did all he could to save her. And when he realized that she was lost... he chose to drown with her. These are her jewels. I always keep them with me. Oh, no. No. I could never wear them. I understand you, Miss Adele. You know, I always wanted brothers and sisters. No, you don't understand me. You don't know how lucky you were to be an only child. This wind. - I thought it would never end. - You must be tired. Yes, quite right. - I saw your cousin this morning. - You saw him? - Yes. - How did he look? Well, he was dressed up to the nines. Yes, I never have seen anybody looking so elegant. What was he talking about? Did you hear what he was saying? He told funny stories. Really funny ones. He had them all laughing. Even the footmen were in stitches. The letter. Did you give the letter to Miss Lewly's cousin? Yes, of course I did. What are you waiting for? Give Miss Adele her reply. There was no reply. The lieutenant read the letter but didn't want to answer it. Oh. It doesn't matter. I didn't really expect a reply. - What was there on the menu? - It was General Doyle's chef- you know the one- who thought up the menu. There was turtle soup, curried chicken... salmon... venison steaks... filet de sole in truffle sauce... artichokes with pear peppers... and Scotch grouse in whiskey. Raspberry ice- That letter, you know- the lieutenant didn't even open it. No. He looked at the envelope, shrugged his shoulders... stuffed it into his pocket without reading it. For a man in love, that's a funny way to behave. Whoa. Whoa, there. - This is the bank, Miss Lewly. - Thank you, Mr. O'Brien. Yes, I'm expecting a draft from Europe. Yes, madam. The last desk over there. Thank you. Can I help you, miss? Yes, I am expecting some letters and a draft from Europe. - Your name, please? - Miss Lewly. - Here we are. - Thank you. This letter says I am to receive a money order. I'm sorry, but money orders take longer to come through than ordinary mail. I think you'll have to come back in about two weeks. Two weeks. Thank you. My dear parents... if I left without a word... it was to avoid another one of those discussions... which even the simplest things seem to provoke in our family. Were he to leave his post... Lieutenant Pinson would jeopardize his future. It is therefore impossible for me to come home now. You know that I love him. He loves me, too, and we wish to marry. But I will do nothing until I receive from each of you... a reply and your formal consent. I send you my fondest love. Adele. My father owes me 2 months' money, May and June. I know that part of this is being sent to me... through the British Bank of North America... but I will certainly need the full amount. Life in Halifax is very expensive. The small things in life... must be treated as if they were important. I know that moral battles are fought alone. Thousands of miles away from my family... I'm learning to look at life differently. Now I can learn everything all by myself. But where love is concerned, I have only him. When I see him, I'll say to him... "If one of us doesn't love enough... to want marriage above all... then it isn't love. " So many times he has reproached me... for the violence of my emotions... that when life brings us together again... I'm determined to do nothing that will startle him. I'll be able to win him over through gentleness. Gentleness. Good afternoon, Miss Lewly. Your money order has arrived. Oh, thank you. - Here we are. - Thank you very much. - Yes, madam. This way to the cashier. - Right. Thank you. - Thank you. - Good day. We're going home now, Mr. O'Brien. I'd like to speak to the young lady who lives here. Miss Lewly, yes. - What name shall I say? - Tell her it's her friend from Guernsey. From Guernsey, yes. Come in, sir, please. Miss Lewly! - There's someone here to see you. - Someone to see me? Who is it? I think it's him, the lieutenant. I'll be right down. Miss Lewly's coming right away. Please go down and make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Will you excuse me if I go on with my work? Please do. - You're Lieutenant Pinson, I believe. - Yes. It's a long time, isn't it, since you saw Miss Lewly? Yes, it is. One could hardly say that your cousin's a very cheerful young lady. But the house is much more lively since she came. Yes, we love having her with us. You can see at one that she's refined, well educated... and she's so pretty. She's got such beautiful eyes. Yes, sir, she's going to be so pleased to see you. I'm sorry. I'll have to go. I'm on duty. - Please wait. She won't be a moment. - I'm sorry, I don't have time. Albert. At last I've found you. Adele, you mustn't stay here. There's nothing for you in this country. I'll go anywhere you want, my love. I'm ready to obey you in every way. You know that I belong to you... that you can do with me whatever you want. I love you so much. Adele, I'm sure you've run away. You're here without your family's permission, aren't you? That's not true. They know I'm in Halifax. I wrote and told my father. And what did the great man say? Because I'm sure you left without telling him. Am I mistaken? I told him I was going to Malta... and I didn't write him until I got to New York. To Malta! Adele, you just told me you're ready to obey my every wish. Very well. I'm asking you to return to Guernsey. Your family must be worried about you. Think of your father, his reputation. And you should not follow me. Albert. There's a way to solve everything. When I marry, I'll have a fortune of 40,000 francs. I'll receive an income of 2,000 francs a year. My family will have no right to tell me how to spend it. And besides, I know that my father and mother... have now given their consent to our marriage. I don't believe it. Show me this consent. I'll show it to you. You don't have it, I'm sure. Your father has always despised me. He'll never give his consent. Anyway, I didn't come to propose marriage... but to ask you to leave Halifax. Look at this. What's this mean? I don't understand. It's a marriage proposal to me from Canizarro. Who is he? He's a friend of my father's, a great Italian poet! Well, then you'd better marry him. But it's not him I love! Don't you love me anymore? Albert. Do you love me now? I did love you, Adele. Tell me I can hope. Tell me you'll love me again. You won't answer. Then I ask only one thing. Even if you don't love me, let me love you. Please, let me love you. Take care. If you cast me off, I'll go to your superiors. I'll show them your letters! I'll do anything to harm you. I'll tell them how you've behaved. I'll get you thrown out of the army! No. No, don't leave. Here. What's this? To pay your gambling debts. I'd need 10 times as much to pay my debts. Keep it for the time being, I beg you. I accept, but not as a gift. As a loan. Whatever you want, my love. You will come back, won't you? We'll see each other again, won't we? If you prefer, I can meet you in town. Whatever you want, wherever you want. You are so handsome! My love... I'm so happy we've found one another again. The worst thing in the world was your absence. Let's never let a misunderstanding... come between us again. Oh, I knew you couldn't forget me. When a woman like me gives herself to a man... she is his wife. I'm no longer crying now. In one's life, one cannot change father, mother, or children... no more than one can change wife or husband. I'm your wife... forever. We'll stay together until we die. Listen. The poor child. Are you there, Leopoldine? Leopoldine, I know you're there. If you're there, you must help me. I've no more jealousy and no more pride. I've gone beyond pride... but since I can't have the smile of love... I condemn myself to its grimace. At present, I want to think of my sisters... who sufferin bordellos... and of mysisters who sufferin marriage. They must be given liberty and dignity... and thought for their brows and love in their hearts. I have the religion of love. I don't give my body without my soul... nor my soul without my body. I'm still young... and yet it sometimes seems to me... that I've reached the autumn of my life. Ah, Miss Lewly. But you're not wearing a coat... and in such weather. I'll get you something hot, a nice grog. No, thank you. I have no time. I've just come for some paper. How many reams? Uh, I need two. Two reams, please. This morning I was thinking I might see you today. Since you didn't come last week, I said to myself... well, usually the young lady comes on Wednesday... although it's true that in weather like this... people prefer to stay home. But still, in case you might come... I put them aside anyway. Thank you, Mr. Whistler. Ah. You remember my name. As for me, it's not difficult to remember you. People who write as much as you are rare in Halifax. I hope I wasn't being imprudent in preparing this for you. Oh, I'm sorry. I don't have enough for both of them. Just give me one. Oh, no. Take them both. You can pay another time. No. I don't want to. Yes, yes. It's my pleasure. Thank you. Good-bye, Mr. Whistler. Good-bye, Miss Lewly. Oh, what's happened? She's fainted. Let me give you a hand. Coachman! I'll go to Madam Saunders'. She may need a doctor. - Mr. Whistler, do come in. - Good afternoon, Mrs. Saunders. How is Miss Lewly's health? Well, she's better, but she's still in her room. Oh, yes. This is the paper she usually takes. She must've run out by now. - Thank you. - Don't go. I'll tell her you're here. - She'll be so pleased to see you. - Ah, yes. That's fine. Miss Adele thanks you very much for the paper... but she's too tired to see anyone. - But she'd like- - No, it doesn't matter. - I was only passing and I thought- - Thank you. - Of course. - Sorry to have troubled you. - Good-bye, Mrs. Saunders. - Good-bye, Mr. Whistler. Thank you. My dear parents... it is a trembling engaged girl who writes you. Mr. Pinson is resolved to marry me... but only on the condition... that he receive both your consents to the marriage. I am practically without money, for one can't live in Halifax,... on less than 400 francs a month... and I could never stand owing money... to the people where I'm staying. My health is excellent. My dear parents, I send my love to you all. Don't forget to send me news about my music album. You've given it to the editor, haven't you? The doctor's arrived. It's Dr. Murdock. Send him in. Oh, wait, Mrs. Saunders. Could your husband mail this letter? I'd like it to go out today. Of course. Doctor, you can come in. Dr. Murdock, Miss Lewly. Good day, Miss Lewly. Good day, Doctor. Give me your hand, please. How is she, Doctor? It's a little more serious than a simple chill. A touch of pleurisy. But only if she'll let herself be looked after- Oh, she'll be well-looked after, Doctor, I promise you. Yes, but our patient seems rather headstrong. Her recovery may be long- uh, two, three weeks, perhaps longer. Ah, if only spring would come. - Could you post this letter for me? - Of course. I'd ask Mr. Saunders to post it, but he won't be in until late. Who in this house can be writing letters to Victor Hugo? Miss Lewly. Miss Lewly? What do you know of this young lady? Well, she hasn't told me very much about herself... but I know she's French. She did say her sister was drowned at the age of 19. Drowned at 19. That's Leopoldine. Do you realize that your lodger... is the second daughter of Victor Hugo? But this Victor Hugo- Victor Hugo is the greatest living poet... like- I don't know- Homer, Dante, Shakespeare. He's also a political figure who was persecuted for his ideas. At the risk of his life... he opposed the coup de tat which overthrew the French Republic. His two sons were imprisoned, and he had to seek refuge in Brussels. Now he lives in Guernsey, an island between the coast of France and Britain. She did tell me about that island. I assure you, madam, this man is a genius. Incredible. I am very proud to have examined this young woman. Do you realize, Mrs. Saunders... that your lodger is the daughter of the most famous man in the world? - Should we tell her we know who she is? - Oh, no, Doctor. If Miss Adele's hiding under an assumed name... she's got a very good reason for doing so. No, she's an honest person... incapable of doing anything wrong. If she wants to conceal her identity, we must respect her wishes. You're quite right. We must keep this to ourselves. Just a moment. I want to make a note of the address. You never know. "Monsieur Victor Hugo... Hauteville House... Guernsey... Channel Islands. " Remember to think of me. I tremble with love. You cannot desert me. I am not myself without you. At this moment, I don't loveyou. Our secret is hard for me to keep. Don't be surprised if you see me in the street someday... speaking out my love for you. Atwell! - Yes, sir. - Where was this coat cleaned? - At the usual place, sir. - Did anybody touch it? - Not that I know of, sir. - All right. Thank you. "British Bank Of North America" - Here's your mail, miss. - Thank you. What are you doing? - What's your name? - David. Oh, David. That's a lovely name. - What's your name? - Mine? Mine is Leopoldine. "Your mother is very ill. Don't forget, when you write her... that she can only make out large handwriting. I'm sending you 700 francs through the Bank of Halifax... plus both of our consents to your marriage. " I, VictorHugo, former peer of France... authorize my daughter Adele to marry. "But hear me, Adele... I'm telling you formally... either marry right away or return immediately. " I lied to you. My real name is Adele. I don't understand you, Adele. What are you doing here? You're wearing disguises to spy on me now? On the contrary. I dressed like this so as not to embarrass you. Well, thanks, Adele. Thank you. Albert, I absolutely had to see you. I've received the consent from my parents. Look. So your father changed his mind. I wouldn't have believed it. So you see, we can be married now. I've already told you, Adele, it's out of the question. How you've changed, Albert. You can't have forgotten the letters you wrote to me. I haven't forgotten them. In some of them, you mentioned marriage. I could show them to those women... to all your mistresses. Albert, you haven't forgotten? All right, it's true. I did consider marrying you. I'm no longer thinking of it. What's the harm in that? But, Albert, it wasn't I who pursued you. It was you who sought me! It was you who wanted me! It was you who took advantage of my father's soirees... to touch my arm. It was you who caressed me in the hallways. I gave myself to you. You have to keep me. Do you hear me? You have to keep me. You can't be serious. I knew women before you. I've known women since you, and I'll know still more. But when we're married, you can have the same freedom. You can see all the women you want. You see... I saw you with that woman and her dogs. She looks charming. Have you told her about me? There are times I wonder what goes on in your head. I want so much for us to be as we were in London... in that room where I came to you in secret. Foryou, I've trampled on everything... I've abandoned everything. I spurned my parents' affection. I betrayed the man who wanted to marry me... the only man who loved me. Listen, Adele, I won't tolerate black mail between us. But I love you. Is that so hard to understand? I love you. If you really loved me, and not in this selfish way... you wouldn't try forcing me to marry you. If you love someone, you allow him to be free. Adele, if you really love me... you'll leave Halifax and go back to Guernsey. Tell me you love me. Adele. Please. I'm ready to go away. I'm prepared to never see you again... but I only ask you for just one thing... before we part forever... to say if you could still love me. Kiss me. My dear parents... I have just married Lieutenant Pinson. The ceremony took place Saturday in a church in Halifax. I need money for my trousseau. I must have 300 francs immediately... in addition to my allowance. If you'd taken care of my music as I've asked you 100 times... that would bring me in some money... and I wouldn't have to behave like a beggar. From now on, you will write my address as follows... Madam Pinson, 33 North Street... Halifax, Nova Scotia. I request that you write "Madam" on all letters... clearly on the address. I hope this good news reaches you soon in Guernsey. What are you all doing here? We're waiting to see Mr. Victor Hugo. Mr. Victor Hugo isn't well and won't be along today. Really? Oh. "The Guernsey Press Co. Ltd. " I'd like to see the editor of the paper, please. Here's a letter from Mr. Victor Hugo... to put an announcement in the paper, please. Ah, so Victor Hugo's daughter married an Englishman? Yes. Lieutenant Pinson. Pinson, the colonel's waiting foryou. Ah, Pinson. Listen to this. "Married in Paris on September 17... Mr. Albert Pinson, of the 16th English Hussars... who fought with distinction in the Crimean War... to Mademoiselle Adele Hugo... daughter of Victor Hugo... officer of the Legion of Honor... one time peer of France... and former people's representative under the republic. Member of the Academies Francais... and knight in the order of Charles llI of Spain. Domicile in St. Peter Port, Guernsey. " Well, Pinson, so, become the pick of us, have you? While you're here, drilling in Halifax... your double is off in Paris... marrying Victor Hugo's daughter. And where did you fight in the Crimean War? In Baden-Baden or in Monte Carlo? Colonel, I assure you, this is some kind of a joke. It's true, I often visited the Hugo family in exile. Miss Hugo is a highly strung young lady. I did hear that she left her father's house... but I've no idea where she is now. And I give you my word of honor as an officer... that I had nothing what so ever to do with this announcement. Come to the point. Are you married or aren't you? No, Colonel, I am not married. I'm prepared to believe you. But if your behavior were beyond reproach... you would not be exposed to mishaps of this kind. You will do me the pleasure of clearing up this misunderstanding without delay. One more escapade, and I shall have you brought before a court-martial. Very well. You are dismissed. - Good afternoon, miss. - Good afternoon, sir. - I have a letter for you. - Oh. - There you are. - Thank you very much. Adele, we are extremely disappointed. You deceived us. You're not married, and there's no hope you ever will be. Mr. Pinson has written us. He informs us he'll never marry you. Your mother wanted to go to Halifax, to bring you home. It was very difficult to dissuade her. Such a journey could prove fatal to her. Her health is getting worse everyday. I'm sending you 600 francs to pay your fare back. If you decide to come back... your brother will meet you in Liverpool. I love you. You have your father's heart felt love. Adele, think of your mother. Think of us. Come home. My dear parents, you're right. I wasn't able to marry Lieutenant Pinson... since he failed to keep his promises. He wrote me many letters asking me to marry him... and I had a chest made to lock them in. I don't agree with your idea... of having the lieutenant sued for breach of promise. If you really want to write him... let him know... let him know how happy you would be... to accept him into the family. And tell him that he wouldn't find a more loving wife. I love my mother and father. I love my brothers. I love you all. But no human power can make me leave Halifax... as long as the lieutenant is here. Miss. I have a package foryou. It's a gift. I'd put it aside for some time... but I hesitated to give it to you. There. It's for me? Yes. Open it. I'll wrap it up again. I thought- Someone said- Someone's been telling stories, and you listened. I will not be spied upon. There must be another bookshop in this town. - Lieutenant Pinson? - Yes? This for me? Albert, my love... Do you like the young woman who brought you this note? If you do, keep her with you until morning. You are so handsome, Albert. You deserve to have all the women on Earth. Please accept my gift. It's all right. You can relax. You can lie down again. Go to sleep again. It's all right, Miss Tillie. Everything is all right now. It's fine. It's all right. Okay- It's all a lie. It's just a big fake. All a big fake. - And now, ladies and gentlemen- - No good. Just a big fake. - Get off the stage! - Who are you? Come over here. - If you're so clever, please do. - Yes, I'll come and show you now. Nah, it's a big act. - Yes, come over. I'm waiting. - It's easy. Anybody can do that. That's easy. Cushy. It's simple. - Sir, you are the clever one, are you? - Yes. How are you? Nice to see you here. Stay here for a moment, will you? Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs... I will now take my partner, Miss Tillie Wong... out of her state of hypnosis. When I count three, she will be awake. Now, one... two, three! - It's finished now. - Simple! Anybody can do that. A round of applause, ladies and gentlemen, for Miss Tillie. Thank you. - What is your name? - Ralph Williams, mounted police. - Would you mind repeating this? - Ralph Williams, mounted police! I see. Well, since you are so well mounted, would you mind sitting down? Make your self at home. Relax. I will have to put you to sleep, of course, first... since you are willing to experiment with me. And may I take your hat off? Now, you just relax, Mr. Williams. Just forget about other things. Listen to me carefully. Concentrate and follow every one of my orders. You're very tired. Very tired, Mr. Williams, very tired. Your hands, your arms... are very heavy. Your legs are heavy like lead. Within a few moments you're going to fall into deep sleep. Now, at "one," your eyes are falling down heavily. At "two," your eyes are closed. At "three," you are fast asleep, Mr. Williams. Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs... It's a beautiful day. Mr. Williams is rowing on a beautiful lake. It's very hot, and he's rowing. Hard, Mr. Williams! Hard! More! You've got a long way to go. Hasn't he? Very hot today, Mr. Williams. It's very hot. You can unbutton your coat, Mr. Williams. Now, you're rowing very hard. Harder! And harder and harder. Now you can even undo your trousers, Mr. Williams. Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs... if I wanted to, I could force this man to leave the police... and finish his life in a monastery. But we are not going to go that far. That's enough. Enough, Mr. Williams. Madams, mademoiselles, monsieurs... when I count "two"... Mr. Williams is going to get up, wake and go away. Now, then- one, two. Stop, Mr. Williams! Your clothes! Your clothes. Yes, Mr. Williams, here you are. There you are. Thank you very much. Thank you. Sir, may I come in? Please do. I was in the theater. I just saw the show. It was remarkable. I was very impressed. But I'm not here just to tell you that. I would like to propose a business offer. Oh? Business? You have a theater? No. That's not what I meant. I'm listening. Well? You're not saying anything. I am very intrigued by your power. You are very kind. I am only doing my work. I am just an instrument of a force... coming from elsewhere. Does this power have any limits? Oh, yes. Space, for example. I cannot act on subjects outside of my presence. But tell me. Are you a journalist? No. I'd like to employ your talents for a personal matter. - To cure someone sick? - No. I've done it before, you know. No. It's not for that. Could you change someone's feelings? What do you mean? I mean... for example, change love to hate... or vice versa? No, I'm sorry. I- No, I can't. I can only work on the bodies, not the souls. All I can do with hypnosis... is to force certain people to act against their will... and I do mean certain people only. Occasionally, there are subjects who do not respond. Listen, sir, could you compel a man to marry a woman? - Against his will? - Yes. Oh, yes. Why not? Provided one can lure him to a certain prearranged place. And then one would need... all that's necessary for the ceremony- a minister, of course... and then two witnesses. Well, on careful consideration... it's not easy... but it's not impossible. It's only a matter of money. I have money. Tillie. Come on out. Hurry. Come on. Come on. Hurry. - So you have money? - My father has. - Where is your father? - In Europe. He's a rich and famous man. In Europe? Then I can write him, and he'll send me the money? No. I don't want his name mixed up in this. Listen, my dear, it will never work out. It's much too serious a matter for me to rush blindly into. Besides, why should I trust you? Who is your father? Either you are completely unrelated to the man you claim to be your father... and you'll never succeed in getting enough money- for I should need a great deal- or else you are really his daughter... in which case, I cannot afford the risk. So you're saying you refuse? I refuse. I won't do it... unless- Listen. I'll need 5,000 francs... in advance. I'll have the money in a week. Fine. Well, can we- Excuse me, guv. Where'd you want this uniform? Over there? Madam- Look what you've done, you stupid idiot. Get out of here! - You ignorant- - Ow! Ow! Get out! Go on, get out! I denounce the lying of legal status... the swindle of identity. Born of father unknown... Born of father unknown. I was born... of father unknown... of a father completely unknown. But I don't know my father... if I was born of unknown father. Ayoung married couple is buried in the same coffin. Not even death can separate them. The dress of the young dead woman... is displayed in her parents' home. But it's mine, too. It's my home. The dress of the young bride... is displayed like a relic for all visitors. And what about me? What am I to do? Oh, my eyes are aching. My eyes. I can't look at them any longer. I can't stand to see that trunk of clothes any longer. My sister's clothes will have to be thrown away! They'll have to be burnt... or given away! I can't stand the sight of those dresses! Oh, my eyes can't stand them! Oh, my eyes! Miss Adele! Let me in! What's the matter? How can he do this? He can't do this! Johnstone. Agnes Johnstone. O'Brien, do you know Mount Emiliamena? - Yes, Miss Lewly. - Take me to it. I want to go there. But I'll have to turn 'round. It's the other side of town. Whoa. Wait. Wait for me. - Yes, mademoiselle? - I should like to see Judge Johnstone. - I must see the judge. - You cannot come in here, miss. - Yes, I can! - You must have an appointment! Who is it, George? It's all right, Miss Agnes. There's a young lady who wishes to see the judge, but she has no appointment. Don't make such a fuss. I'll go to my father. I'm sure he'll see her. I must see him. Absolutely. My father will see you now. Thank you for agreeing to see me when you don't know who I am. You're French, it would seem. Yes. I'm the daughter of Victor Hugo. The author. I do not share his political ideas... but I admire his courage. Sir, I'll come right to the point. I've just read of your daughter's engagement... and I have to tell you that Lieutenant Pinson... is absolutely unworthy of becoming part of your family. I don't know, Miss, if you appreciate... the seriousness of what you're saying. I am perfectly aware of it. I have known Lieutenant Pinson for some years. He was cunning enough to insinuate himself... into the good graces of my family. He courted me, discreetly but persistently... and I must admit that I responded to him. I had little experience of the world... for two years of exile had kept me from it. This young man knew how to charm a naive young girl... and I was indeed naive. I was so naive that I broke off my engagement... with Mr. Auguste Vacquerie, a friend of my father. I had only one thought: that of marrying Lieutenant Pinson. But your parents? My parents were strongly opposed to this marriage. My mother, who suspected I was meeting Lieutenant Pinson... in secret, found out about him. He never was the son of a clergyman. He was imprisoned for his debts. As he couldn't pay them... he was given the choice between prison and the army. He chose the army. But because of my determination... my parents gave their consent, and our marriage took place. Lieutenant Pinson even signed the contract. Have you any proof? Of course. Here. Here are some clippings from the Guernsey newspaper... announcing our engagement and marriage. If this lieutenant is as bad as you say he is... how can you still be his wife? Do you think people can always control their feelings? One can be in love with a man... and still despise everything about him. And besides... I'm expecting his child. You're ridiculous. Left wail! - Evening, George. - Miss Agnes is not at home, sir. - But she's expecting me. - Miss Agnes is not at home. - Then I'll have a word with the judge. - The judge is not at home, sir. But his carriage is in the drive. I'm very sorry, sir. There's no one at home. I intend to have that woman deported. To hell with the scandal. Come now, Lieutenant. Calm down. There is a way. - Have I ever given you bad advice? - All right, I'm listening. If I've got it right, all this woman has to do is leave Halifax... - and your troubles are over. - But how do I get her to go? I've tried everything- threats, prayers, promises. I've even begged her. Nothing works. She follows you like a dog. She won't leave Halifax until the day you do. That's a lot of help. Thank you very much... since there's no question of me leaving. Well, sir, I've heard differently. There's a rumor going around... that the regiment might be sent away very soon. We're going to miss you... but I'm happy you've made the right decision. And your parents will be so happy... to see you again after all this time. I hope that... May I speak of Lieutenant Pinson? I hope you've put him right out of your mind. He's not worthy ofyou. Who does he think he is... refusing to marry you? You're mistaken, Mrs. Saunders. I'm the one who didn't want to get married. I think marriage is degrading for a woman... especially for a woman like me. My work requires solitude. And think about my name, Mrs. Saunders. Think about my father. I could never give up the name of Miss Hugo. Yes. Yes. I understand. This incredible thing... that a young girl... whose only bread today... depends on herfather's good charity... still suffering from hatred after 4 years... this thing I willdo. This incredible thing, that a young girl... should step over the ocean, pass from the old world to the new... and join her lover- this thing I will accomplish. Miss Adele, I have a present foryou. It's a cape. It's too pretty for me. It'll look so much lovelier on you. You'll keep it in memory of us. Thank you, Mrs. Saunders. Thank you so much. Au revoir, Miss Adele. Write to me when you get home. Where to, miss? I don't know. I don't know anymore. Why don't you stay with Mrs. Saunders a few more days? I can't. I don't want to see her again. Shall we go to the hotel? I have no money left. Well, I do know a place where you wouldn't have to pay. Don't touch that. It's my book. Please- Please, do you have my mail? - I don't know who you are. - But I always get my mail here. I'll go and find out. No. I am sorry, miss, but these people are new here. They don't know who you are. I'll just see if there's a letter foryou. - Yes. - Thank you. Adele, here are 700 francs for your return passage. If you persist on staying in Halifax,... I will regard this money as an advance on your pension. You complain of my slowness in getting your music published. For the present, it would be better... for you to avoid attracting attention to yourself. Your mother is so ill that we keep your letters from her... in order not to aggravate her condition. She has left Guernsey and settled in Brussels... so I am staying alone in Hauteville House. Adele, my dear one... my arms are opened to you. I am old. My greatest joy... would be to have all of you by my side. "Morning Herald" "Brussels. We have learned of the death of Mrs. Victor Hugo... "wife of the famous French poet. " "We here by announce that the 16th Hussars... stationed in Halifax... will be moving on February 15, 1864... to the Barbados Islands. " Move aside. Leave the French lady alone. Excuse me, Mrs. Pinson. I have to have a word with the captain. Of course. There's something you ought to know. I was in the Negro Quarter this morning... and at the market place I saw a European woman who was causing quite a scene. I got nearer, and it was her- Miss Hugo. - What? - Yes, and I've got worse news than that. She's going by the name of "Mrs. Pinson. " We have to find her. What happened in Halifax mustn't happen here. What did he want? Oh, it's nothing, really. It's nothing. I'll read the letter for you. I've changed it a little. You can tell me if it's all right. "Sir, I am only a simple woman from the Barbados Islands. I don't know how to read, but I know the name of Victor Hugo. Ten years ago, I was still a slave... and I know that you are the friend and defender... of the oppressed on Earth. I had noticed in the streets of Bridgetown... a woman dressed like no one else... who seemed to be poor and marked by destiny. Children made fun of her in the streets... and this distressed me. One day, I felt obliged to protect her. I brought her to my house and took care of her. I have learned that she is your daughter... that she was abandoned by an officer... whom she followed to Halifax and then here, to Barbados. Sorrow has broken her, body and soul. If her body is now healed, her soul is perhaps lost. Adele needs to return home to the warmth of her family. I could, if you agree, Mr. Victor Hugo... bring your daughter back to Europe. Mr. Werder, of Martinique... will advance me the money for the journey. " And so Adele returned to France, accompaniedby Madam Baa. Major changes had taken place in Europe. The fall of Napoleon III... had permitted the return of Victor Hugo... who went home to France after 18 years of exile. Reunited with his daughter Adele... he had to place her in a private clinic in Saint-Mande... where she lived for 40 years. There, she enjoyed gardening, played the piano... and continued to write her journal... in her own secret language. Adele outlived all her family. Her father died on May 22, 1885. His last words were, "I see a black light. " The day of Victor Hugo's funeral... was a day of mourning for all of France. Victor Hugo's body lay in state all night... under the Arch of Triumph. And the next day, two million Parisians... followed his coffin from the Place de I'Etoile... to the Pantheon. The death of his daughter Adele on April 25, 1915... passed almost unnoticed... in the turmoil of the First World War. Fifty years earlier, as she was about to leave Guernsey... Adele had written in her journal... "This incredible thing, that a young girl... should step over the ocean... leave the old world for the new world... to join her lover- this thing will I accomplish. " "This was the story of Adele H. "
