Just look at him and you'll see. But his lover is stolen from him. He's a thief, serves him right. No! I said I don't know! She told you she's marrying Keitaro? Then why deliver her dowry? But it's my trade. You're such an honest fool, just like your dad! What? From long ago, I love this dumb side of yours. You're dumped, right? I've never given up on you. I didn't know this.

No... She said she's going to work in a linen factory in Aichi. Linen? Labour volunteer? Good girl. Work hard. I'm in a hurry. Bye. He was headmaster of the primary school. He lost his mind after his 5 sons all died in the war. Come. Bomber! Watch out! That's a crow. A crow? Pee? Go sit there. Ava Nita. 19. Moyo Sugita told you to go with her? If you go, you'll have a nice room, same food as the family. 8 hours work. Free time after that. You'll learn Western sewing. You may go to night school. Work for 3 years, you'll save your own dowry. She said that? It's the same trick as the past. It's a dream! You fell into such trap? Moyo gets 3,000 to 5,000 yen for each of you. We've taken her many times, but she keeps doing this. She makes 50,000 for 10 persons. Your family is poor and so on... Chief is back. Hello. - Hello. - Welcome back. - Welcome back. - Hello. I was at the town office, they're preparing the homecoming of Trade Minister Maruo. Trade Minister? When? 21st of this month. Glorious homecoming. He's the second son of the liquor store. He made it big! Cute baby. Yoshii, another one? Not mine. Found in the toilet of the morning train for Tokyo. Oh my... Go to the town office... no... childcare service? She? A sold girl. - Again? - Yes. Let me. Cute baby. His name? Shigeru. Shigeru? Shigeru. My name is Shigeru too. Same name as Yabuda? Be a cop when you grew up? You don't like cops? Better not. You'll just be the police jeep driver. Or... you want to be the Prime Minister? Don't like that too? You don't like the Prime Minister. Then don't be that. High! High! Don't cry. A cute baby! Whose kid is it? Let me hold him. High! High! He peed? Naughty DOV- We have just praised you. What to do? Pee or poo? Pee! There's a diaper? Smart sister. Now let's change it. Such a cute baby! And cute sister. Who's the mom? Bad mom. Feel better? Hanakawa. Come. Please take her home. Her mother told her to go, she said. Her mom is sick. Don't get fooled again. Understand? Yes. Thanks. Thank you. Alright. Let's go. The economy is bad. Bad times. Bye. Such a long way. Sorry. We're almost there. So beautiful! Nice weather. It feels so good! The leaves will soon be all red. They will by the end of the month. Lots of wax trees in my home town. And red leaves too. The sight is unbeatable. Now I'm getting thirsty. There is some fresh water over there. Nice! You? What is it? I can't go home right now. Why? I have to pay the money back if I don't go. The debts, doctor's fees. The money is all spent. How much is that? - 3,000. - 3,000? 3,000... It's not that much... Not just that. Once I get there, I'll get 15,000 right away. I can pay off our debts. My family doesn't have enough for this autumn and winter. I'm asked to marry someone. Marry? If I accept, then our debts will be paid. But I... don't want to? I'd rather work very hard at the factory, than to be married into that family. Don't. Don't marry a bad man. Don't! But that won't work. Let's go and talk with your mom. Three of us. Sorry for the trouble. I understand what you said. I won't make her work far from home. - Really? - Really. I've been in bed so long. I feel so weak. My girl has worked so hard. When I get well, we'll work together, and things will be fine. Don't say such things. Work? You're still... What? I'll be OK. Don't worry. So you're marrying her off? No. I won't force her if she says no. What a relief! She's so understanding. Looks like we worried too much. Your sister won't be leaving. Be good to each other. Look after your mom. Time to leave. Madam, take care. Thank you. Sorry for the trouble. Bye. Take care. - Goodbye. - Thank you very much. Bye. Good job. When did you come? Your mom too. She knows what to say. Just then, I saw you coming with this young fellow. I thought I'd be caught, I ran here and told your Mom, she said OK and even apologized. When I saw the cop, I got so scared, thinking I'd be caught! Wait a bit. She'd leave in 4 or 5 days. Sure! Next time she'll take the bus to the next train station. That rookie cop. He's feeling good? How could such fool understand us poor farmers? Yes. He looks so handsome. Like a movie star! TOWN OFFICE Sorry to keep you waiting. We're so busy preparing for the minister's visit. - Tough work. - Yes. We have a Childcare Service here. But we have no facilities to take care of babies. Not even a desk. I'm working here, but have outside duties. Why don't you go to the orphanage? I'll give them a call. ORPHANAGE They're abandoned, not orphans. Our policy is strict, that is to serve only... orphans who are duly registered. We won't take children other than those. I see. HEALTH CENTRE HEALTH CENTRE I'm so sorry but we... are set up to serve the health needs... and to provide infant inspections for our town people. We are constrained by the town budget. SOCIAL SECURITY OFFICE Excuse me. Excuse me. Hello. Excuse me! May I? Can I talk to them? What is it? Come. Don't cry. Shigeru is smiling. Don't cry. Hungry? Bread man!

So cute. We can take him in for the night, Mom? Sure, if it's for Yoshii. Thank you so much. Abandoning these cute kids. There must be some reason behind it. Still, their Mom is so cruel. Eat the candy. OK then. Put it in. Thanks. We can let her stay too. Just the baby. That's enough. Thank you. Thanks again. Let's go. I'll leave the bundle here. Sure. Such a cute kid. Thanks.

Show me your bag. Come to the station. Hi. Hey. Anybody have time? Yabuda. Let's play! Get your gear. I'm the partner of His Highness. Sometimes play for real and hit him hard. - That OK? - Sure. If you spoil him, he'd get more egoistic. Let the old man win. Or he'll vent his anger at us. Yabuda! What are you waiting for? Get ready! Go easy on him. - Where did you take this? - Umakura Village. Horsehead Buddha. - Where in Umakura? - Kiseki Tribe. They have such thing there? They have the best Horsehead Buddha. This? What god? Read this. Read what? Samurai on horse. Hachimantaro, or Yoshiie. Come. What? - Shoplifting. - Oh. - Big sale everywhere. - Yes. When has your husband gone missing? The 3rd of this month. It's been 2 weeks. You have 2 more kids? Yes. You're looking for him, then you stole these? Yes. Hello. Thanks. It's your shop? Yes. These the stolen goods? Yes. That's all, I think. Just these... no need to arrest her. Don't do it next time. Bye. We found 29 pieces from you. Any more? - That's all. - Your finger. One more. A Taiko drum of the shrine of Bosawa Village. Where is it? I sold it to the youth club of my tribe. For our cultural events. - Is that it? - Yes. Bye. Take them back. - Bye then. - Bye. Thanks. Fool! - Hello. - Hello. Hurry. Take care.

Why? Sorry. - It's that Moyo again! - Sorry. Like a demon! Where will you join her? Bus stop? The train station? The next station this time? Say something! You won't? Why go with that trafficker? Even if you won't talk, I could arrest her. Don't make me so worried about you. Just tell me your meeting place. You won't tell me? OK. Bye. What she does may be illegal, but she's helping us. Even if I can get a job properly, they won't lend me money right away. I won't believe... the job would be so good as she said. Even if it's tough, I'll have money. That's enough. But... can't you see you'll suffer? I won't think of the future. Now is what counts. If you go, your health will be wrecked. I'll figure it out then. Reckless! Farmers live like this! Others won't understand. Cops too. You don't understand! Leave me alone! Fool! I got the prepayment money. I came to give you that. I know it's not much. But you can use it. I can't take this! You can! - Take it! - No! You're so stubborn! I can't take it! Wait! I can't! SERVANTS OF THE SOCIETY I'm the chief. What's the matter? We're from the Irrigation Union. Irrigation. What's the matter? We have a favour to ask. And that is? Taxmen from Sendai came all of a sudden. They're here to look into the irrigation expenditure. We took them on a trip around this area. We came to ask for... your permission... to let us ride on the same truck. You didn't see the billboard at the entrance? We did. That's... "Traffic..." "Traffic Safety Week." Week? Yes. "Traffic Safety..." Month. "Traffic Safety Month." That's my reply. Get it? We understand... but... we farmers can't afford a limousine. A tour bus costs money too. - That's why... - No! Except for floods and fires, it's forbidden to ride on trucks on non-emergencies. Now is the "Traffic Safety Week". No... "Traffic Safety Month"! If I may tell you, chief. That irrigation investigation... will determine... the agricultural tax rate of this prefecture. It is a matter... of life and death to us farmers. That's why we take time off our busy work, to show the taxmen around this area. Please make an exception this time. No matter what, the answer is no. Chief... Weasel No! Only on floods, fires or emergencies! Yabuda! Yabuda! Stan the jeep. I'm preparing the security for the Trade Minister's visit. TRADE MINISTER MARUO BANQUET VENUE Hello! Thanks for coming. Trade Minister Maruo Banquet Venue. Thanks. Thanks. Oh. - Thanks for coming! - Thanks! Thanks! - How about the places? - Minister, here. - Police station chief, here. - No, there. - There? - Prefectural chief. - Police station chief? - Here. No! He should sit here! - Town Office chief? - Here. Stan again. If you put him there, he'll be angry. Come in. Please sit down. Thanks. Thanks so much. When do you have this baby? Were you pregnant? Stop kidding. No kidding, but the police asked us to take him in for a while. First it was just 1 day. Then 1 more, 1 more... It's now 5 days. Oh I see! The abandoned kids case of Yoshii? When such a laid-back person like Yoshii asked you, you just can't say no. But it's been too long. She's grown so fond of him. She wishes if he is our own. He likes me so much. He'd stop crying when I hold him. He's so lovely! It's not easy to take care of babies. The elder one would be easier. Elder one? You didn't know? What a relaxed chief. I set it! The sister! Oh you! Where is she? You really didn't know! She's playing! Mom. How does it feel to abandon your kids? She'll stay before we found her mom. We have 5 or 6 already. One more is the same. Yes. Poor girl. Shigeru. WELCOME! TRADE MINISTER MARUO Thanks. Nice weather. - Thanks. - Thanks. There aren't as many people as we thought. They're not too keen. That's no good. The whole town should come and welcome the minister. When a movie crew came, 12 windows here were broken. How about some fireworks? Banzai! Banzai! Today is? For the Trade Minister. That's all? That's all. Really? It's a crime to hide things. Really. You know that place Ichinomiya? Yes. From long ago. Long ago? I worked there. You worked there, so now... you're sucking the blood of these girls? No! Out of the blue, my ex-boss came visit me. She asked me to find her some girls. She'll give 1 dress to each girl. 1 dress? 21 girls? Yes. 5,000 yen each? No! 2,500 yen. You said 3,000! Her name? That boss? Toku Kasamatsu. Kasamatsu... She's not using the girls for her factory, but sells them to other factories? Perhaps. That's a crime. You too. - Hello. - Hello. Thanks. That minister is really no big deal. Come. Sir, could you excuse me? Why? I'm not done yet. I have to go to the Labour Inspector. Labour Regulations Inspector? Yes. With the long name. They want me at the same time. Of course I can't. Sol came here first. I see. Go there later. But they'll scold me! I'll go now. I'll give them a call. We're working your case first, not them! Hello. This is the police station. Labour Regulations Inspector? Hello. I was going to call you. Really? Actually... it's about the trafficking case of Moyo Sugita. You haven't really started on that. We're going to prosecute her, please give her back. We've completed our investigation. We're about to prosecute her. Sol refuse your demand. What? No! She broke the labour regulations, so it's our case. It's our responsibility to prosecute her. Please give her back. Of course not! I don't know your side, but we have the responsibility to prosecute her! I don't get you! That's wrong! Your thinking is wrong. I really don't get it. You can't see this... but the Labour Inspector from Aichi is right in front of me. He'll come to you. From Aichi? Sure. We'll be waiting. - Well... - He'll come here, just wait. Akanuma. That trafficking case? Here. The Labour Services called. They want you. Labour Services? A moment. He's Matsuki. Hello. The Moyo Sugita case? We're about to prosecute her. But we've been following up on her. It's none of your business. None of our business? We have the overriding authority to prosecute cases in the prefecture. You can't take it from us! That's funny. This case is an infringement of Labour Law, and the labour regulations. What's the police got to do with it? Stay off this. Of course not! We investigated her first! This type of things... has long been the specialty of ours. That's about the Labour Law... Even if it's the Labour Law... - It's our... - Give me! I'm the chief. But... Even if it's the Labour Law, it's the police's duty to prosecute her! You don't know? Listen! I don't care for other things, but this is prosecution. When I said "Listen!" You listen! I said this is prosecution! No! It's so clear that... the Labour Services take care of the Labour Law! That's why the Labour Services should prosecute... No! it has nothing to do with the Labour Services! Gel it? Thanks. May I? This man. He's here. From Aichi. - He's here? - Show him in. Aichi Labour Inspector... - Benibayshi? - Wrong pronunciation. Kurebayashi. Everyone wants to handle this! I'm the chief. Let me be frank. This is a case of our region. - Your region? - Yes. Both the victims... and the criminals are in our region. The main culprit is our resident. I don't want you to meddle in this. Main culprit? The factory owner Toku Kasamatsu. He sold the girls. No... she. Although Moyo Sugita makes 3,000 yen for each girl, Toku makes 5,000 yen for each girl. Huge profit. So she's the main culprit. Despite that, we should make the prosecution. No. Let's forget Toku, but don't you want to know the core of the case? Moyo Sugita is just a supporting role. That's no way... to handle this case. They'll take all day! Just like that. No! We should prosecute! Stupid. We do it. We do it! It's none of your business. Go back! - Go back? - Yes! Then alright. Don't regret for stepping over. Country police. Damn! If we're careless they'll take away the case. No! Then I go on. That's your lunch? May I have some water? There, drink it. Chief is inside. Chief. We're going to show the minister around. We want to borrow your jeep and fire engine. The jeep, yes. But the fire engine... is just for fires. See, there are only 2 or 3 fires each year. - Yes! - We shouldn't waste this engine... that's paid by our budget. This is the right occasion. Showing the minister around is our emergency right now. But it's now the "Traffic Safety..." But chief... There's no time. Let's say we have his permission. Hey you! Thanks! Yabuta! Yabuta! The jeep! Look at this! So little water. This year it'll be very tough for us. Very difficult! ON HIRE Give way! What? Some big brass? Give way! Maybe the minister? Looks like it. The second son of the liquor store? He made it big! He's now back? Give way! Give way now! Yabuta. I've waited so long! Who's blocking the minister! The mountain is before us. Come over here! Good boy! I'm busy today. Sorry I can't play with you. Good boy! Quiet please! She's resting! Buy something for me. 1 tofu, 5 fried tofu. Money, dear. You like babies, Yukiko. You like him more than my own children. Really? Good girl. We'll eat soon. They're here! Hello. Thanks so much. Hello. So lucky this fire engine didn't break down. Thanks to the minister! A fire? Oh my. Come help. Go in. Welcome. Long time no see, Keitaro. Momoyo, are your tits real? Of course they're real! Yes, madam? When she's at the bathhouse, all women envy her. Nipples... Hey! You just got married! - She's Hanae, right? - Don't say this to me. I will! I hate you! You stole her from Iwata! I'm a singer! Please listen to this. I want to do business, but I have no money I want to farm, but! have no land I want to steal, but I have no license - Damn it! - Saké! It's nothing much, I wish to compliment the pride of our region, His Excellency Mr. Maruo, the Trade Minister. For such a useless man like me, you threw such a big banquet. I'm very grateful. So noisy! What is that? The fire engine breaks down. What! Oh. Really? Defense Forces? You're joining, Kinji? Just Iwata. Kinji failed the exam. Their uniform looks smart! Iwata will look great in it. Defense Forces? Me too! You, a rich kid? An only son too. Iwata and Kinji are 2nd or 3rd son of poor farmers. I'm the 4th son! They won't take me. 1,2,3, 4, 5, 6? - Let's eat. - Yukiko isn't here. Where did she go? She was outside just then. Kane, Ippei, look for her. - Outside? - Yes. But you drank a lot of it! I drank with my money! - Shut up! - What? - Please! - Shut up! - Shut up! - Making fun of me? - So what? Looking down on us? What? You know who I am? I'm an official! Don't smile! What? - Ouch! - You OK? - Oh! What happened? A dark banquet! So bad! I'm really sorry. Funny! A black out at this time! Stop it! It's too dark. Stop it! What happened? The whole town, it seems. Lights over there? - It's on next to us. - Really! - On? - Yes. - Why? Call the power company now! - What happened? - The fire engine crashed into it. What are you waiting for? - Get some candles! - Yes. I'm so sorry. Saké! Who kicked me? - Please calm down... - Bastard! - You're drunk... - I'm not drunk! Shut up! What have I done to you? Stop it! Who do you think you are? Hello. Your phone please. Sure. Police please. Police! Police. A drunk man? And a blackout? Coming. - What is it? - Blackout in Yanagimachi. Crying alone in the dark. Poor boy. Don't cry. Baby, why are you crying like that? It's on! Spend the night with me! No! Noisier! Oh? You? Madam! Madam! That girl. That... You... What is it? Where's Yoshii? Yoshii? You came alone. Why? Why? Shigeru. You came for him? Shigeru! Don't cry. Shigeru! Yes? Really. Come in. Now. Go to him. Mom! Shigeru. Shigeru! You sister is here! You miss him, right? Sure. Stop crying . Stop. Stay here from now on. It's a 6-year-old girl. You look that way. Yes. Where is she? - Hello. - Yes! It's Yoshii. - A small... - Yukiko? - She's here. - Here? - Yes. What a good sister! She came to see him. - I see. - Come in. That's good. - Yukiko! - Oh, Yoshii. It's really your first time? - Yes. - Not lying? You ran away from your wife and kids for 20 days? - I'm off. - Bye. Hurry. You stupid cop! He's the drunk man? How dare you! Country cops! You know "cracy" from "democracy"? Crazy! That's OK. Let him lie there. What? Take your time. We country cops have a place to hold you. Bye. Wait! Wait... The Moyo Sugita case... She's all yours. You won't be unhappy? Of course not! Please take it. It's time. Bye. Thank you. Yoshii. Mother of the abandoned kids. She wants them back. Where were you after dumping them? I went to... Tokyo. Now you want to see them? Yes. Selfish! They're well. Living happily. Stupid mom! Dumping them cute kids! Sorry. She said she was looking for her missing husband. You should have come to us! Kuramotsu. Didn't pay for meals. Come this way. Eatery near the station. Last time was shoplifting. Now meals. Oh you! Sit down. What did you eat? - Say it. I won't be angry. - Curry rice. Curry rice? Yummy? Yes. And? That's it? Lemonade. Lemonade. And her? She only drank tea. You were expats? Yes. You found your husband? No. Our village people... said they saw him yesterday. This morning... I came. Your husband's name? Yes. Jushiro Takaya. Come here. Come. Hurry. Know that man inside? It's my husband! My husband! Dad! Dad! Why are you here? What did you do? For 20 days... you don't want us anymore? Like that. What did he do? He left home to work. The work didn't go well. Then he stole luggage. Not serious, both of them. Let's not prosecute them. Let them start again. I'll ask the chief. Take them out. What is it? What is it? They... want to take in the kids from now on? Yes, they'd like to raise them like their own. Yukiko, Shigeru too? Both of them. At first I took in Yukiko, but... the granny likes the baby, the madam likes Yukiko. Let them fight for it. Let's go. Yes. Look. That big house. They're now inside. Now let's get the kids. Make them happy. Let's go. What is it? I... don't think I have the strength... to take them back and raise them. Why say that now? I'm not like that woman, I don't have someone... to go with! Oh my... In fact, I came back... to take them to die with me! Die? Fool! What? Let's go back. Then we'll talk this over. Hey boy! Yummy? Ready. This isn't much... but please take it. Stan a new life. Now you know your kids are well. They can stay there and you'll work in Tokyo. Yes. But you want to see them, right? The baby, yes. But... once you see Yukiko, it's hard to leave her.
