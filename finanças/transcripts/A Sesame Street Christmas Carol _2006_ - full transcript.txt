'Tis the Christmas season once again on a street called Sesame, a street where, year after year, sunny days have given way to crisp sights and sounds of winter. And friendly neighbors have met to exchange warm holiday greetings, warm enough to make small red monsters giggle and old friends unite. This year is no different, for with the season comes the magical, snow-covered silence of a very special night. Tonight is Christmas Eve. Everyone is snug in their beds with visions of sugarplums dancing in their... Would you keep it down out there!? Of course, not everybody gets into the holiday spirit. Oscar is still a Grouch, to begin with. Hey, Mac, how's a Grouch supposed to get any sleep around here? You just keep blabbering on and on. Excuse me, Oscar, but may I be the first to wish you a very merry... Hey, don't say it. There's only one merry thing about Christmas. And what might that be? It only comes once a year, and this year, I plan to sleep through the whole thing, fruitcake and all. So if you don't mind, just read this. "Do not disturb until after Christmas!" Oscar." That's right. So just take your Christmas greetings and scram. Nighty-night. Ha. And so Oscar the Grouch settles in for a long winter's nap, and an eventful nap it shall be. "A Sesame Street Christmas Carol." Let's see. Oh my... I don't know exactly where this is. Well, this looks okay. Try this way. Well, this is Sesame Street. It's charming, but uh... Where does Oscar the Grouch live? I've been past the tree, and I've been past Hooper's. I'll try this way. Okay. Oh, no, that's not it. Let me try over here. Oh, oh, maybe over here. Um, uh, um... Where is this Oscar the Grouch guy? Oh, oh! Hey, there's a sign. I better read it. It says, um, "Do not disturb until after Christmas! Oscar." Oscar! He must live here! I better get this over with. Good evening, Mr. Grouch, sir. Scaredy Pants Delivery Service. Huh. I better try something different, then. Good evening, Mr. Grouch, sir! Scaredy Pants Delivery Service! Heh. Well, I guess nobody's home. - Hey! - Aah! Can't you read? Yes, Mr. Grouch, sir. And may I compliment you on your very fine handwriting skills. Aw, great, thanks for nothing. No wonder they call him a Grouch. Who are you and what do you want? Don't you know it's the middle of the night? Yes, sir, and I'm Joe Marley, sir, Scaredy Pants Ghost-o-Gram Delivery Service. I'm here to deliver you the first of three Ghost-o-Grams this evening, and this is number one. Hey, well, I didn't order anything. Let me see that. Thank you for being so very understanding, sir. This is a vintage 1843 baked beans can. Hey, I love junk mail. Oh, it's not just any baked beans can, sir. It comes with a card. Mm. Give me that. Just read the directions on the card word for word, and you will be visited by the first of three ghostly spirits. - You gotta be kidding me. - Oh, no, sir. Opening Ghost-o-Grams is very simple. Read the card, and the ghost will appear. The ghost will deliver a meaningful message. The message will make you a better person... or, uh, Grouch. It's as simple as one, two, three! That wasn't simple. That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Hey, I don't make the stuff up, sir. I just deliver the Ghost-o-Grams. Good evening, sir! Man, I thought he'd never leave. Well, let's see here. "Place can on solid surface." Okay. There we go. Okay. "Now, read as follows: "I love rubbish, anything tarnished or grubbish, "it's a real blast, watching Christmases past, things that happened a long time ago-ish." Ago-ish? Um, you've left out the last line, mate. It's against Ghost-o-Gram policy for me to exit me can until I've heard the entire message. Whoa, it's working. Oh, let me see, let me see. Uh, says, uh, "Ghost in a can, obey my command, bah, humbug!" Step back, mate. My contents are under pressure. Ah! Alley-oop! Jumping junkyards, that scaredy guy was right. Rhubarb, the Grouch of Christmas Past, at your service, lad. Rhubarb? The Rhubarb the Grouch, from London, 1843? Why, you're Grouch royalty! Oh, you're too unkind. Well, it's terrible to meet you. Oh, no, the displeasure is all mine, I assure you. Well, says here on me schedule that I must show you two old, heartwarming home movies from Christmases long ago here on Sesame Street. A little trip down memory lane, so to speak, right? Wait a minute. You're a Grouch! Why would you wanna show me Christmases past? The Scaredy Pants guy said you were gonna teach me how to appreciate all the good stuff Christmas is about and show me how to be a better Grouch. He said it was as simple... As one, two, three. Scary, isn't it? Oh, righto. But don't worry your Grouchy head. This is only me temp job. Normally, I'm haunting Her Majesty's wastepaper bin. - Yeah. - No kidding? And about these movies, from one Grouch to another, there's nothing written here what says we have to enjoy the experience now, is there? Yeah, you're right. So we watch old Christmas home movies and complain about it! Precisely, governor. That's a terrible idea, and I love it. Welcome to the Grouch Plex double feature. Our first blast from the past, "Gift of the Magi," starring Ernie and Bert. A buddy movie. My favorite. "Tis a movie about giving from the heart, thinking about others, and what makes them happy." This film is rated G. Yeah, G for "Get it over with." Let the show begin. Hey, look. The film's all brown and scratchy. Oh, that's because it's from the past. It's really, really old. Old and sappy. Golly, Christmas Eve, and I still don't have an idea for Ernie's present. It's gotta be something really special. What? What... what is? Oh, Ernie's Rubber Duckie. Hey, wait! That gives me a neato idea! I'll get Ernie a soap dish to put his Rubber Duckie in. What a nifty idea! Oh, I'm home, Bert! Oh, Bert? Hey, what's this? Why, it's a paper clip. I bet this is from Bert's paper clip collection. Of course. This is Bert's 1957 ACME. Why, he'd feel just awful if he lost this. Hey, now I know what I'll get Bert for Christmas. I'll get him a cigar box to keep his paper clip collection in. That's what I'll get him. Then they'll never get lost again. Oh, hi there, Mr. Hooper. Oh, hello, Ernie. What brings you here? Well, I'm just doing a little bit of last-minute Christmas shopping, and uh, there! That is a fine-looking empty cigar box up there. Oh, ho! Really? Well, thank you. Uh, well, Mr. Hooper, I don't have any money, but uh... suppose I gave you Rubber Duckie here for that cigar box. Would you trade? Ernie... Your Rubber Duckie? Are you sure? Well, uh... I just gotta have that cigar box, Mr. Hooper. Well, uh... If that's very important to you, here you are. Oh, well, thank you, Mr. Hooper, and well, here's... Here's Rubber Duckie. Goodbye, Mr. Hooper, and goodbye, Rubber Duckie. Goodbye, Ernie. Uh, Mr. Hooper. Oh, hello, Bert. Hi, Ernie, I was just... Yeah, me too. I just, you know... - Mr. Hooper? - Yes? - Yeah, uh, Mr. Hooper! - Yes? I am prepared to offer you the deal of a lifetime. - Ready? - Yes, I am. Ta-da! Huh? Huh? This is the finest paper clip collection in the Western world. Isn't that a beauty? Now, look, look, look, look. See there is my Jumbo Jim right in the middle. Isn't that a beauty? And over there, right by your hand there, that is a chrome-plated one I got at a paper clip manufacturers convention. It's very impressive. Oh, it's wonderful. And they're all so... So individual. Uh, yeah, well, I am prepared to trade you this terrific paper clip collection for just one small soap dish. Color, pink. Yeah. Huh? What do you say, Mr. Hooper? Do we have a deal? - Well... - Huh? I must say, you talked me into it. Oh, terrific. Thank you. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Thank you, Mr. Hooper. Mr. Hooper, do you think that maybe I could come and visit my paper cl... Never mind. Well, time for bed, Ernie. Yep, it is beddy-bye time, Bert. Yeah, sure is. Bert, I can't stand it any longer! Let's open these presents tonight. - Yeah, yeah! - Oh, good. There you are, Bert. That one is for you. Ernie, thanks. This one right here's for you. - Oh, great, Bert. - Yeah. Okay, but you open yours up first, would you? - Can I? - Please. - Oh, thanks a lot. - Mm-hmm. Oh, Ernie, what a great, superb packing job. Mm-hmm. You just cut the ribbon corners so neatly. Now if I can just slide my finger underneath the paper and get the tape... No, how 'bout a scissor? Well, maybe if I just... Oh, Bert, just open it up, would you? Oh, yeah, okay. There. Oh, Ernie! A cigar box! - Yeah. - Aw, hunky dory! I got it especially for your paper clip collection, Bert. What? I got the cigar box so you could keep your paper clips in it. Oh. Uh, yeah, well... Come on, Bert. Put your paper clips in there so I can see how they look. I just can't wait to see. Uh, gee, Ernie... Um... Hey, wait. How 'bout your present? You didn't open your present yet. - Oh, okay, Bert. - Come on, open it up. - All righty. - Come on, yeah. Let's see. Oh, boy, oh, boy. I can't wait. Yeah. Let's see. Yeah. Trying to get in here. Yeah. I wrapped it good, huh? You certainly did, Bert. Oh... Why, it's a... Oh. That's a soap dish, huh? That's right, yep. A soap dish. Oh, it's beautiful, Bert. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it for Rubber Duckie. - What? - Yeah, yeah, so he won't keep falling into the tub and sinking, you know? Hey, let's see how he looks in it. Go get Rubber Duckie. Yeah. Come in. - Oh! - Merry Christmas, Ernie! Ah! Merry Christmas, Mr. Hooper! Hey, I just came by to drop off some Christmas presents. - Oh, wow. - Oh, wow. This is for you, Bert. Oh, thank you, Mr. Hooper. And this is for you, Ernie. Oh, gee, thanks a lot, Mr. Hooper. Oh, wow. How nice. Hey, what did you get, Bert? Well, I don't know. I'll open it up. Open up yours first. Let's see, should I untie the ribbon or get a scissor and then take it from the outside... - Bert! - Yes, yes. - Just open it up. - Okay, yes, yes, yes, yes. Aw, my paper clips. Oh, Mr. Hooper, thank you. Yes, you're welcome. - Oh, wow. - But Bert, how did Mr. Hooper get your paper clip collection? Never mind, Ernie. Just open your present. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, yeah. Let's what you have. Let's see, let's see. Let's see here. What is it? What is it, huh? Oh, it's not... It's Rubber Duckie! Oh, hi, Rubber Duckie. - Ernie? - Hmm? How did Mr. Hooper get Rubber Duckie? It's sort of a long story, Bert, but thanks a lot, Mr. Hooper. You're welcome. - Hey, Ernie? - Yeah? Ernie, we didn't get Mr. Hooper anything. Oh, you're right, Bert. You're wrong, boys. I got the best Christmas present ever. - What do you mean? - Yeah, what do you mean? Well, I got to see that everyone got exactly what they wanted for Christmas. Well, Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Mr. Hooper. Oh. Merry Christmas, Ernie. Merry Christmas to you too, Bert. Oh, that was so moving! Makes me cry like a baby in an onion factory! Hey, you gotta be kidding. Got you there, didn't I, mate? Aw, yeah. Good one. I give it two Grouchy thumbs down. All that friendship and giving from the heart stuff was way too sappy. Indeed it was. Next up, another musical featuring an overgrown canary walking around singing about how much he misses his furry, elephant-like friend, Snuff-a-loofy... Sniff-a-luffle... - Snogly, um... - Snuffy?

Oh, of course I do. Well, surprise me then, please! Oscar, dear, you'll be thrilled to learn about lots of different holiday traditions. Each one is enjoyed in its own special way. They are celebrations you share with your friends and family, like Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. Hanukkah and What-za? Hanukkah and Kwanzaa. Both are wonderful celebrations of culture, community, and tradition enjoyed with... Wait a minute. Let me guess. The three F's, friends, family, and food. Oh, Oscar, I do believe you're catching on. Well, just wave that thing so I can get some sleep, huh? Grouchy boy. ♪ Ah ♪ My family celebrates Hanukkah, and I like to set up the menorah.

And every night, we talk about one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa. They're ideas for how to live a good life. Tonight's principle is Umoja. It means unity, coming together, getting along. Like when Tyler lets me play with his drum? Right. My favorite part of Kwanzaa is the Karamu. It's a feast on the sixth night. Kuumba, where my whole family and friends gets together and celebrates. I love it, I love it. Delicious. We eat lots of food, tell stories, and then, in my family, we like to dance. We always have fun when we're together for Kwanzaa, and at the end of the night, we get a small present. My own drum? Wow! Mm. Did you notice the wonderful blending of traditional red, green, and black in the Kwanzaa centerpiece? Well, how could I miss it, Miss Happy Tree? Ugh! I've never been one to speak ill of another, but really, may I be frank with you? Well, please do. That would be excruciating. Ah, in all of my ghostly travels, I have never met anyone as fussy, rude, and out of sorts as you. Well, Carol, may I be frank with you? Of course. Well, that's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. Somehow, that doesn't surprise me.

Today, families enjoy holiday dinner at the table, but in the future, holidays will be enjoyed in zero gravity. No need for messy food when you can enjoy a delicious, chewable space food capsule instead. Mmm! In the future, Christmas trees will come already decorated. But we already have one of those.

I like the holidays just the way they are. Achoo! Season's greetings. We hope you enjoyed this short and informative presentation, "What Holidays Will Be in the Future." I will now play the soothing sounds of the season for your listening enjoyment. Time to change the channel. Get lost, Tin Man! I cannot do that, Oscar the Grouch. Get lost does not compute. Does not compute. Happy holidays, deck the halls, ho, ho, ho! Let's build a snowman. Isn't this fun? Sorry, we're out of your roaming area. Ring-a-ding-ding, Christmas bells are ringing! Oh, it's not working. He won't stop! This lousy music's driving me nuts! - Season's greetings. - No! This can't be happening! Mr. Oscar! Mr. Oscar! Are you okay, sir? No, I can't get away from this Christmas music. Wait, it's you. What? You're Joe. Joe the Scaredy Pants guy, huh? No, I'm little Joey Dickens, you know? From Brooklyn. Yeah, well, where's the robot? - Where is he? - Robot? You got a robot for Christmas? Wow! No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. There was a robot here, see? A freaky lady dressed up like a Christmas tree, and a Grouch of Christmas Past. Actually, he was kinda cool. Hey, Mr. Oscar, maybe you had a bad dream. Oh, yeah... Well, I did have liver and onion smoothie before I went to bed. Well, that could do it. Well, anyway, Oscar, it's Christmas Day, and I just wanted to bring you this sticky ball of used wrapping paper. Oh, hey. This is for me? Mm-hmm. - Hey. - And do you know what? I bet you're gonna get even more by the end of the day. Eh, really? Yeah, yeah. Hey, you got a point there, kid. Plus the sun is out, so all this rotten snow turned mushy and gray. Yeah. Yeah, and best of all, tomorrow is the day after Christmas, and this'll all be over. Yeah, I guess that's one way to look at it. Yeah, and so hold on, kid. Huh? Well, I was gonna give this to Slimey, but he already has one, so it's for you. Huh. Ooh! Gee, Oscar, this is, uh, the smelliest thing anybody's ever given me. Yeah. Well, Joe, I have only one thing to say. What's that, Oscar? Have a Grouchy Christmas and bah, humbug. I'm sure glad Oscar feels better. Ooh! That is one stinky present. And so, Christmas returns to Sesame Street, where even a Grouch can find reasons to celebrate, even though he'd never admit it. I heard that.
