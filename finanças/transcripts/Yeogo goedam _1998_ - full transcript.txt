WHISPERING CORRIDORS This is Hur Eun-young. I can't answer the phone, so leave your message. Second year, third year... second year, third year... second year, third year-- Mrs. Park, you're still here. I had to check something... I'll be leaving soon. I suppose the new term is keeping you busy. - Need any help? - I'm fine. Library Hello? - Eun-young? - Mrs. Park? Jin-ju is here. Jin-ju? - I don't know. - What are you talking about? She's definitely dead... but she's here. She's been here all along. Mrs. Park-- Eun-young? Hello? - What are you doing here? - Uh? Waiting for you. What? What did you say? - I was waiting. - For me? Why? Why were you waiting for me? We're the class monitors this week. Yoon Jae-yi, trying to make me feel guilty, huh? I'm not late though. I'm running fifteen minutes early. Of course, you're not late. I'm the one who came too early. We never promised to meet here. Why didn't you wait in the classroom? It's cold out here. I hate to go to an empty classroom. That's creepy. Sorry. Don't just stand there moping. You'll jinx my chance of spending... this senior year in style. What? Want to become a school gate ghost? Come on. What's this? I'm not sure, but I think she's possessed. Possessed? You know, by the study demon. One with a low IQ though. Were you good friends? Look at her. Does she look like a friend of mine? Oh, I forgot to bring a rag. Hey! What? Give me that, fool. You don't need to take it back with you. Hurry up. Ji-oh! It's your duty as her students. If any of you spread rumours... and damage her reputation, you will never be forgiven. Understood? Don't distract the other students with gossip. Understood? It's for your own good, okay? Fortunately, we're swearing this oath of honour... before all hell breaks loose. If you break your promise, you'll pay for the consequences. - Got it? - Yes, sir. Got it? Yes, sir! You'll take the blame for any rumours coming from Room 3. Understood? Yes, sir. Why did she kill herself? It's not clear. The police don't have enough clues. She may have had her reasons for killing herself... but why do it at school? I'm sorry for being late. The principal will appoint a new teacher for Room 3 by the end of the day. Also, he will give special instructions about how to handle this matter. Make sure this is kept confidential, especially outside the school. And make sure the students keep quiet too. Hey! Are you sure? Did I ever lie to you? Yeah. I swear this is all true. She committed suicide? You can't call it suicide just because she hung herself. Something is fishy. Nobody liked Old Fox, you know? Jin-ju is here. Are you sure you want to give this to me? Isn't it a family heirloom? Thanks, Jin-ju. - Is your dad still drinking a lot? - I don't know. Don't be so cold. Did you hear? Jung-sook was the first one here. Yeah, and she wasn't even a monitor this week. She was here even before the monitors. Remember? She had an argument with Old Fox last week. Yeah! That's right! Why are you two whispering? You making out? Go work in a factory if you can't cut it. Or stay at home! You hear? Such degenerates! Jang Jin-ju Look at your uniform! Hands out. You're such a bad influence. What's this smell? Incense? It figures. The nerve! Just like her shaman mother. Miss Hur? Miss Hur? A penny for your thoughts. You weren't answering. Oh, were you calling me? You're the only teacher with that name. Sorry, I still feel like a student here. Really? So, she used to be your senior year homeroom teacher? Her death must have shocked you. She said she had something to check. I assumed it was important. What was she checking? I'm not sure... but she was looking at her class agenda book. She's definitely dead... but she's here. She's been here all along. It's not that I don't want to do it with you... I just won't do it anymore. We're not children! Do it on your own. Nobody else can call the spirits. Just this one time. Please? Oh, mighty spirit, come to us. Please draw us a circle if you're here with us. Draw us a circle if my friend is a virgin... or draw an "X" if she's not. Having fun? You guys, come here. What the fuck is he doing in here? Hasn't senior year put some sense into you? You did it again, didn't you? Huh? If you're so psychic, make a living out of it. Why bother with school? I asked her for my grades. Lim Ji-oh, are you a shaman, or a witch doctor? Then get better grades for yourself. You're lowering the class average. Go back. Who was that? Who's the smart-arse who just laughed? I see. Everyone on your desks, now! I'll teach you all a lesson! Arms up! Can't you greet your new homeroom teacher with respect? Homeroom teacher? Due to personal matters, Mrs. Park is unable to continue her duties. I'll be taking over from her, you hear? This means two things. One... You will have a better chance of getting into college. Two... You won't have any personal life for a year. It's the new term of your senior year... so you're a little excited. I advise you to get rid of such cheap sentimentalism. Those are luxuries a senior should do without. Got it? My motto is: "Keep your own place." This will be the class motto from now on. Got it? You're each other's rival... but speaking frankly, you're each other's enemy. The worst enemy in war is yourself. When you can defeat your inner enemy... then you can be a true winner. I've re-scheduled the practice exams for tomorrow. Be prepared. Get used to it and stop whining! Do the best you can. It's for evaluation purposes. So, don't get stressed out, alright? If you don't have what it takes, well... I got nothing to say then. Class dismissed. Start cleaning up. Ah, bitch, wish we had exams every day. - What? - Then school ends early. Crazy bitch, exams never kept you from leaving early anyway. You're always the first to dive out of the classroom. - It's better to relax after exams. - Bullshit. - Ow... - Is it stuck? Shit, it's blocked. Strange, we got pierced on the same day. Mine is fine, though. Ouch. Stop whining, bitch. See? It's going in. Stop it! It hurts. Alright! I'm trying to take it out, you slut. Want a bloody slit up your nose? Hey! What are you staring at? You bitch! Didn't you hear me? What's all the fuss? Hey, you psychic, mind your own business! Hur Eun-young I'll ask them to replace the missing yearbooks. So, you're an alumni, right? How did you know? You were pretty famous as the student with looks and brains. My grades were nothing special... and the yearbook shows prettier girls. Why did you choose to be a teacher? I guess it's not so bad after all. Can we drop the formalities when we're alone? If you insist. The teachers often compare us to each other... but they say I'm prettier and smarter. You're certainly pretty, but do you also get good grades? Yes, I'm applying for Seoul National University. To do what? Does it matter? It's the best university in the nation. There must be something that interests you. Nothing special. Besides, I hate studying. Once I get accepted, I'm done with books. A degree from that school is like a gold card for everything. Even though you'll be done with books, it wouldn't hurt to read Joyce. How come you're still here? Aren't you going home? I didn't get a chance... to thank you earlier. You like to do girly things, don't you? Thanks anyway. Have a seat. Practicing for art school? Nope. I'm supposed to have no talent. How would you know? It's what my mum says... She thinks I don't have any talent and it's a waste of time. Well, actually, she's right. This is just for fun. I'd like to see it. No way. It's embarrassing. I know. You can't show your pictures to everybody. You're like a little girl. Okay, you make me feel sorry. I'll show you. You see... I told you so. Why paint something so scary? Well... school can be... a horrifying experience for... both students and teachers. Like witnessing a tragic death. Know what I mean? I guess that's why... I can't forget the image of Old Fox hanging there. It's like an inspiration. Terrific. What is? - You are. You speak like an artist. - You're kidding. I can't even paint. Of course you can. You need to improve your skills... but you know how to control light. Bad paintings drain the life out of their subjects... because they lack this quality. But this painting shows an understanding of light. You have a good eye. That's the most important element to be a good artist. You must have studied painting. Oh... a long time ago. When? In junior high? No, longer than that. I gave it up though. No talent, like someone I know. Jae-ji, will you teach me how to paint? You can join me when you get bored of teaching. No? I... Is it a yes or no? Alright. I can't teach you much, but if you insist. Promise that you'll do as I say. Okay? Now you sound like Mr. Oh. We're mortal enemies. Don't tell me you're his niece? Isn't this great, Jin-ju? Miss Hur. What are you doing at my desk? Is this your desk? Yes. What brings you to our classroom? This used to be my homeroom. It brings back memories. It's still pretty much the same. I didn't do that. I know. I did it when I was a student. Was this your desk? No. It was my friend's... Jin-ju. Excuse me. Jin-ju, this will be your desk forever. Here. Her address is in my diary. I want to meet her family. I'll explain later. It's really important that you find it. I'll drop by later. Bye, Mum. Looking for an old flame? No, a girlfriend from high school. Lost touch after graduation? Kind of. Call that friendship? Not keeping in touch with each other? I guess it happens when you're busy. She died in high school. Oh, the student who committed suicide? Was she your friend? Yes, of course, you were in Mrs. Park's class. But why are you looking for her family? Just being curious. Go to the school storage room. Her ghost haunts the place. You'll get to meet her in person. A couple of girls claim that they've seen the ghost there. So she died in the art room? It used to be the art room. Shit! She must have jinxed the place. We've had builders getting sick or hurt. That's why that building is abandoned. Of all the places to die, why choose the school? Lim Ji-oh, you crazy piece of shit! The vice principal nearly had a heart attack... when he found this in the art room. How would you explain this? Answer me! Are you trying to mess with me? - No, sir. - Don't bullshit me! You degenerate! You must be a psycho, a maniac. Is that what your parents teach you at home? Do they let you create such monstrosities! Get out of my sight. You disgust me! Go! Get the fuck out of here! Get out! I dare you. You psycho. You want to die? Die! Die! You filthy... I told your mum not to worry. She's sensitive about your first exam as a senior. If you've finished, I would like to be excused. Why? What's the hurry? I should get back to my books. Don't be a stranger to your own teacher. A woman should be like candy floss. Teacher's lounge So-young. Do you know where I can find that painting of your classmate's? It must have been thrown out. Mad Dog tore it to pieces. Mad Dog? I apologize. That's what we call Mr. Oh. Shouldn't it be "pervert"? - Who's painting is it? - Lim Ji-oh's. I see. It's for the best. No more painting for me. - You want to give up painting? - There's nowhere to paint. There is one place. The teachers will never know. Never mind. What? - Let's go. - Where? I was just joking. You can't go there. Why not? It's a mess, cobwebs and rats. We'll just take a look. Are you mad? The place is haunted. Then stay here. I'll check for ghosts, okay? Who taught you to smoke? No-one. Ever see me learn from anyone? How brave of you! No-one ever sets foot in this haunted place. I prefer ghosts. Besides, didn't you know? I'm a ghost, myself. So, this is the haunted place for avoiding teachers, right? Then lend me some space. I need a place to paint. I've been banned from the art room. Don't you want to kill him? Yeah, why don't you do the honours? You have to pay the rent. I found it first, so it's mine. Then, I'll keep it a secret. Pay the rent? Aren't you supposed to be a rich bitch? I'm sorry. I'm Miss Hur. I came to ask you something and the door was open. I apologize. It's okay. Have a seat. Miss Hur... You haven't been put in detention. Wow, someone did quite a number on this. Why bring it here? I was curious, but the teacher's lounge is... It is uncomfortable there, isn't it? Yes. I guess I still feel like a student. Is that so? I've been here a long time... and I still feel uncomfortable. Do you usually sketch students' faces? I like their expressions. Didn't you have something to ask? Uh... About this painting... Oh, hello. What were you saying? I was in the art club when I was in high school. You were? So you used to paint? No, I sculpted faces in plaster. Sculpted? Yes. I used to sculpt my friend's face as a hobby. Must have been a great gift. I hope they were. - Excuse me. - Ji-oh, just a moment. Here. Take it. Don't give up painting. Class motto: Keep your own place Park So-young. School rank, first place. Go ahead and give her a big round of applause. Kim Jung-sook. Your class rank is second place, yet your school rank is 25th. What the hell are you doing? What's the use of studying long hours if you're not paying attention. If you don't have the brains, ask So-young for some tips. Class head. Hand these out after I'm done. Dismissed! - Attention! - Don't bother, you shits. How can the class with the school's best student have the worst score? Don't greet me until you improve the class average, you hear! Do you have Mrs. Park's class agenda book? No, but perhaps Mr. Kim would know. Night patrolling with female teachers will be fun. That will end the lonely nights. What do you think? Not bad, huh? What's wrong? It's full of dust. Look. You have a vain side to you, don't you? Aren't you scared of this place? All those ghosts... Not at all. In fact, I quite like it here. It's like home. Really? Why? Don't you? Yes. I like everything you like. Strange. Damn it! What's going on here? What the fuck-- Ow! Who's there? Who are you? Order! I'll be filling in for Mr. Oh today, so please behave. - He didn't come in today? - Is anything wrong? How should I know? - Kim Nu-ri. - Here. - Choi An-na. - Here. He must have fallen asleep in the sauna. Nothing can wake you in there. The ghost must have got him! Kim Jung-sook, Kim Jung-sook! Is that her seat? - Yes, sir. - Is she absent? She hasn't come in yet. What's up? She's never late. It was Mad Dog's turn. The ghost got him. I'm positive. Where did you get that idea from? Do I still look like your friend? Hey... - Stop it. - Look, isn't that Jung-sook? I'm sure he was killed last night. What makes you think so? I can feel it. Just like the day Old Fox died. I feel as if I killed Mad Dog myself. You think I was possessed... and murdered Mad Dog? Whoever did it... aren't you glad that he's gone? Look, I'm not joking. I'm serious. What if I'm really possessed? What shall I do? Ji-oh, don't be so serious. Don't worry. He's a die-hard. He must be playing traunt. Do as I say, Eun-young. You'll thank me one day. You won't regret it. You need to choose the right friends. She's no good for you. - Looking for this? - Yes. What for? It's only going to depress you. Class agenda book, Mrs. Park Lim Ji-oh Evaluation notes Lacks the ability and will to apply for college. Oh, it's you, So-young. Is anything wrong? No, nothing. Did you say there were spare yearbooks? No, they suddenly disappeared. So stupid. So typical of the school system. Have you found the painting? Huh? Ji-oh's. You wanted to see it. Oh, yes, I did. Do you know Ji-oh well? Not much. She just sits next to me. Why? She's nothing special, apart from her ability to call the spirits. Call the spirits? Probably her way of getting attention. If you're so curious, she's in the storage room, painting. What's that noise? What are you doing? Get over here. Now! I said now, you bitch! What brings you here? So, now you're following me. Forget it. I have nothing against you. Never avoided you either. Let's just say we're different. Meet me after evening studies. Why? Can't we talk now? Is your sister coming to pick you up? Sister? Sorry, was that your stepmother? She looks so young. Kim Jung-sook... Mind your own business, will you? Is your real mum still in the loony bin? Bloody bitch! To think I took pity on you. You think you could beat me? Guess again. You don't have what it takes. We're different. Got it? Loser. Your mother'll save you. After all, she's a shaman. I never spread those rumours about your mum. It was Mrs. Park who told me. I was scared of being ostracised for taking your side. I never thought that anything bad would happen to you, I swear. If I continued to meet you, she threatened to expel you... for my sake. I was afraid. I'm so sorry, Jin-ju. To my best friend, Eun-young, from Jin-ju Does it look like you, Jin-ju? Don't ever lose it. I told you, I'm Ji-oh. Then why do you have those bells? Where did you get them from? A friend gave them to me. Jin-ju is dead. This is where she died nine years ago. I saw it. She couldn't have given those bells to you. What are you talking about? These are from Jae-yi, Yoon Jae-yi! What's wrong? What happened? To my best friend, Jin-ju, from Eun-young, 1989 We used to be close. So close that we shared our secrets. But then... teachers started comparing us... and we drifted apart. She became distant. I never reached out to her. But... But, I never thought... it would come to this. It's all my fault. To my best friend, Jin-ju, from Eun-young, 1989 Kang Hyun-soo Park Ji-sung You should never have returned. Eun-young has returned as a teacher. Once again Mrs. Park has become the homeroom teacher. Ji-oh hasn't deserted me. You're not Jae-yi... nor Jin-ju, neither. You're not Eun-young. I've always been... and still am, Eun-young. No, you can never be the Eun-young I used to know. You'll become just like Old Fox. You're wrong. I'm still Jin-ju's friend, Eun-young. It's no use now. I don't want to hurt you... but I have no choice now. Jae-yi! You could never kill me. Without you, I can continue being a student. Stop it. What good would it do? You're a ghost! At first, I just wanted to have a yearbook. But then I wanted more. I needed a friend... who really understood and cared about me. But not this way! You can't keep coming back to school! You're not human. I only had to... be in this classroom, like these desks. Nothing more. For the past nine years... no-one suspected my identity. No-one knew I was here. I just had to fill the empty seats... and be there during head counts. I understand... but you have to stop now. You don't understand... now that you're a teacher. What happened to you will never happen again. I don't think so. It always has and always will. Nothing will change. Trust me, Jin-ju. I'll do my best. I will. Trust me. It'll take a lot more than just you to make a change. Stop it, Jae-yi. Stop! I don't care if you're a ghost or not. But you've gone too far this time. Ji-oh, it's okay. Everything will go back to normal. We can never... go back to normal. Don't worry, Ji-oh. You have to stop. I can't let you continue harming the teachers... for my sake. I've waited so long for you. I can't give up now. Stop! It's no use, Ji-oh. Lay a finger on her and I'm gone. Stop the horrors. I can understand you now... but the bloodshed has to end. So many things I wanted to do. I always longed for a friend... who would reach out to me. Finally, I've met that friend. I love you with all my heart, too... really... but not this way. Leave the rest to us. Rest in peace, Jae-yi. I never meant to hurt anyone. I just wanted a friend... and to leave with good memories. That's all. You're right, I can't stay like this... because I'm not a human anymore. I'm sorry. We will... never forget you.
