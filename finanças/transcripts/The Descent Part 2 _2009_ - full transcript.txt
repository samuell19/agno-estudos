With the community still shaken from last year's Slater's Quarry tragedy, here in Boreham, it's fresh heartache. As the search for the missing women moves into the end of its second day, hope is fading for Senator Kaplan's niece, Juno, and her five friends. Just behind me I can see one of the cave rescue teams emerging from the caverns. - Good luck, guys. - Thanks. Chimney's pretty tight. You all be careful in there. - Will do. - Sir, any signs of the missing women? Do you think you'll find them alive? How does this compare to Slater's Quarry? That's enough now. Move back. Do you think you responded quickly enough this time? - Greg, leave it! - Greg! We're back on in 4 hours. - Get some sleep. - You too, boss. - Hey, you want to share a sleeping bag? - What's that cologne you're wearing? Yeah, 6 hours of sweat and dirt and all other kinds of shit. I think I'll pass. Lynch? What's up? What? Where? Look, get a tracker dog out there. See if you can find where she came out. Yeah, all right, and... Let's keep the lid on this. All right, I'm on my way to the hospital. - Right, Doc, how is she? - She's resting. - We had to sedate her. - I've got five girls missing and you put the one person who knows where they are to sleep? She was hysterical. Besides, she has no memory of the last two days. Whatever happened to her, she's blanked it. - Injuries? - It's only some minor cuts and bruises. But her clothes were completely stained in blood. - So it's not her blood? - No. But she's been in a fight, all right, because judging by her fingernails, she scratched some big chunks out of somebody. Test her clothes, get the blood type. Get the blood type of the other five girls. All right, let's see what you can do. Hello, Sarah. I'm Jenna Rios from Hyde County Sheriff's Department. This is Sheriff Vaines. - How you feeling? - Where am I? You're safe. You're at Hyde County hospital. We've been searching for you and your friends. Two days ago you all set off on a caving expedition and you never came back. We've been following your Boreham Cavern flight plan but we found nothing. Can you tell us what happened to you? I don't know. I can't remember anything. Sarah... your friends are still missing. And we need you to help us find them. - Beth. - Beth. What happened to Beth? What can you remember? What about Juno? Jessie. - Where's Jessie? - Your daughter? Sarah, Sarah, I need you to listen to me carefully. Your daughter isn't here, Sarah. She died. - A year ago, in Scotland. - No. I know how hard this must be for you, - but you have to try... - No, no. No! No. Come on. This looks like the end of the trail. - What's that? - That there's Chapel Mine. Cuffs, come here, come here. Go find them, boy. One of these days I'm gonna come up here and help myself to some of this shit. What you found, boy? What you found? Cuffs? Holy shit! - Sheriff. - Dan. Keep it under your hat, but we found one of the girls. Dog picked up her scent near the old Chapel Mine. - That's the other side of the county. - I know. Jeez. Don't tell me we've been looking in the wrong place. Listen, I don't want to shift the whole goddamn circus. I just want a couple of volunteers to pick up where the dog left off. All right, give us an hour. Cath, Greg, rise and shine. Blood on Sarah Carter's clothes, A-positive. Juno Kaplan is A-positive. So? I'm A-positive. Half the state is A-positive. - Can she walk? - Sure. Wait, wait, you're not seriously gonna take her out... Rios, get her dressed and get her in the car. My granddaddy used to work down there. One time, him and two of his buddies broke into a whole new cave system. Really big. Company bosses figured there should be some rich pickings to be had, so they sent my granddaddy back down to have a good look-see. He never come back. Folks reckoned they must've broke clean through into hell. The devil was mighty pissed. So you're telling me that there's an uncharted cave system down there? Cool. There's a map of the mines here. If the caves are uncharted, we won't even know where to begin. Bring the girl. Come on, Dan, she's the only one been down there. All we gotta do is get a nod from her, left or right. Narrows the search. There's a mountain full of caves and fuck-all time. Could piggyback on the elevator cables. You planning to go down there, why not go down there in style? - What, this old shit still works? - Sonny, let me tell you, this old shit-bucket will be working long time after that MP3 of yours. - Whatever. - All right, Ed, get it going. I'm sorry, but Mommy's got to help people tonight. Chica, when Grandma tells you to go to bed, you go to bed, okay? Honey, I love you. Okay, baby, I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Rios, get yourself kitted and get her kitted. We're going down. Okay, Sarah, I know this is difficult, but if you do this, it could help jog your memory. Your friends could still be alive. You have to help us find them. Hey, Sarah, this might fit you. You want to lose that heavy metal. Gun blast down there'd be like dynamite. - Come on, I'll put them in the car. - My gun stays with me. This is a missing persons case. What the hell do you think you're gonna find down there? Mummy. Right, let's get moving. Come on. - You all ready to ride? - Yeah, let's do it. Jesus. Hang on, just wait up a second. Here, drink this. She's okay. Let me worry about her. Come on, Dan, let's get to the goddamn cave. Listen. Down here, I call the shots. Is that understood? Loud and clear. Let's go. Should be a ladder down there. How long have I been teaching you? Your light is your life. Hey. All right. Okay, we've gotta go down another level. Greg. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Is it okay? You know what's good? Modern mines have metal props. - Miners prefer these old wooden ones. - Why's that? The metal ones don't give you any warning when they're about to go. After you. Okay, we should hit the cave system somewhere up here. - Greg, go scout ahead. - You got it. And Cath, you're next. Deputy. I think I've found it. What the hell is that? It's a pit pony. Always a good sign. Check it out. This is awesome. Greg, T.l. Hey, hey. Don't... Don't touch anything. This place is thousands of years old. - Well, you're hot. - Get away. Sarah, do you recognize anything? What? It's okay. it's okay, she just got spooked. Calcium deposits. - Let's keep moving. - It's okay, come on. Come on. Come on. - Come on, Sheriff, you can do it. - I ain't that old yet. Which way? You recognize this? Cath, have a listen. - Anything? - I don't know. I think I hear something. Jesus! - Oh, my God! - Shit! Fuck! Sarah. Look at me. - She's moving. - No. There's no body heat. it's not possible. Deputy. - Okay. - Sarah. She's been butchered. Six girls came down to this cave. One came out. Covered in her friends' blood. Now, you tell me what the hell happened down here. Wait a second. You think she had something to do with this? - This is fucked up! - Dan, get your team out of my face. - Man, you brought her down... - Get off my back! Greg! Save it. I thought she was a victim here. What are you saying now, she's a suspect? I think she knows something. I still got missing girls down here, so let's keep our goddamn focus. I should never have let you bring her down here. - I should never have let you! - Dan, I think she came through here. All right, Greg, take point. Take point! - This is fucking bullshit. - Deputy, look after her. It's okay. Come on, you're gonna be... Sarah, what is it? I think there's something down here. We were attacked. By what? There's nothing down here that could have done this to a person. Sarah, what can you remember? Sarah? We shouldn't stay here. You've got to try and think rationally. You're scared. Your mind's playing tricks on you. I'm through. It's about a 50-foot crawl with some tight spots, and then it opens out. All right, copy that. Sheriff, get your team together. Greg, we're coming through. Look out for them at the other end. Okay, Rios, you go first. I want you in front of her. She's not getting out of my sight from now on. Come on, you're almost there. Come on. Hey! Come on. You need to breathe with me now. You need to breathe, okay? Come on, keep it moving up there. Get a move on, you're slowing down. Why have you stopped? Get a move on! How are you feeling? All right? Hey, hey, hey. Sarah... Sarah... Rios! Sarah! - Sarah! - For Christ's sake, Rios. Which way did she go? Which way? - Shit! - It's okay. it's okay. That lady's a fucking psycho, Dan. Jesus. - You okay? - I'm fine. - Look at me. How's it feel? - You want to kiss it better? - He's fine. - Where's Vaines? - He took off after Sarah. - Fuck! He doesn't even have a radio. Five minutes in these honeycombs, they'll both be lost. Okay, listen to me, listen to me. We've gotta catch up on them before they get too far ahead. This time, we stick together. You understand? Okay, let's go. Yeah, come on. Okay. Okay, there's falling rock here, which, as you know, means the roof's unstable, so we have to tread carefully. Rios? You stick with me, okay? Let's go. - Cath, can you hear me? - Take it easy, that's gotta last. Cath, come in. Cath, speak to me. - Dan, are you there? - I'm here, I'm here. I'm here. Are you hurt? I'm stuck in a boulder choke. And I need something to support the rocks. All right, all right. Don't you panic, don't you panic. Listen to me. I'm gonna get you. Okay? We'll work at this end, all right? You listen to me. You sit tight, we'll get to you. Okay. Jesus. Come here, come on. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Jesus! Dan. Come on. Come on! - Fuck! Fucking trigger-happy Americans. - Dan. Fucking only answer they've got to anything is a fucking gun! Dan, don't let her hear you this way. There's a fucking ton of rubble between us. She couldn't hear a fucking rock concert. Dan. Okay. Okay. Okay, Cath. Yes? - We can't get through to you. - Well, can't you drill it or det it? You know we can't. It's too risky. You're gonna have to work yourself free. I can't, Dan, it'll crush me. I need you here. Okay, I'm gonna find another way around to you. - Okay. - I'll get to you. I'm scared, Dan. That's good, yeah? Fear keeps you alert, it keeps you alive, it's... I promise you, I won't stop till I get to you. I know. - Maybe I should stay with her. - You know we can't help her here. You hang in there, teammate. - No worries. - Okay, Cath. Are you dry? - Yeah. - So you'll keep warm. You keep drinking. You stick with the drill, okay? Okay. We're gonna have to move off now. So you'll probably lose the signal. You stay positive. - Okay. - Okay. We're walking away. You stay on channel one. Okay. I'll be on channel one. You got your chance now. Shit! Fuck! What the fuck? - Are these animal bones? - Jesus. Dan! Dan! Here we are, morning after the night before. - Here we go. Look at this face. - Yeah. Wake up, ladies. I feel like a pig. - Now there's some water. - It's not nice. - We all ready for this big, exciting day? - Yeah. That's Juno. I'll believe that when I see it, all right? How you doing? - Yeah, I feel good. - Good. - Recording for... - For National Geographic. For National Geographic. - Once again... - Recording our trip... - To Boreham boredom Cavern. - How do you think Sarah's doing? Do you think she's ready for this? I mean, she just seemed a little bit... You cut the camera? - Sarah? - Put it away for, like, two minutes! - Where is that? - I don't know. - Holly! Could you take a break? - I just want to take a few more shots. This cave's a lot cooler than I thought. - This wasn't in the book. - Good. Maybe that last jelly custard wasn't a really good idea. - How much further, do you think? - Thank you very much. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Okay, guys? Do you hear that? Is that it? Dead animals, hundreds of them. - That's here. - This is not good, guys. - Can we get out of here? Which way? - That's this place. - Come on. I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? There's no breeze! It could be any one of these tunnels! Take your pick! Fuck it! - Hello! - Please! Is there anybody there? Hello? What the fuck is that? Greg! Greg! Greg! Greg, where are you? Dan! Rios, you there? Dan, I'm here! Where are you? Dan! Where are you? Dan! Rios! Rios! Rios! Where are you? Let me know where you are! I can't hear you! Sarah. You let him die. What the fuck was that thing? Don't worry. It's just your mind playing tricks on you. Dan? Greg? Dan, is that you? Can you hear me, Dan? Sarah. I... I'm sorry I didn't believe you. They're blind. They track sound. You're louder. - Greg! Greg! - Cath! Where's everyone else? We got split up. - What the fuck are these things? - I don't know. I don't know. - I want my fucking torch. - Shit. Sorry. Here. Is this okay? Okay? Okay. All right. Run. Run! Run! Jesus! Dan! Jesus Christ, Dan. Fuck. Fuck! Are you there? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? ls there anybody out there? Come in! Anybody? Up! Up! Up! - Dan's dead. - Turn it off. Turn it off! Come in. Anybody? Are you there? Can you hear me? Come on, can you pick this up? Can you hear me? Dan? Dan, come in. Dan, it's Cath. Come in. - Dan's dead. - Dan. Come in, Dan. - Vaines had his radio, Cath. - We don't know that. We... He wasn't clear. - Dan? Dan, come in. Dan? - Give me that. Give me. Give me that. I left him there. Those... Those fucking things attacked us and I left him there. No. No, he promised he'd come back. He promised he'd come back. I heard him scream, Cath. I heard him scream. He's gone, Cath, okay? No. No. I ain't gonna run out on you. You even try, and I'll kill you myself. We gotta move. Stay quiet. Come on. Jesus. - Fuck. - Fuck. Fuck! - You'll have to jump. - It's too far. Use her to get across. Go. - Fuck! - We have no choice. Fuck! Fuck! Go! All right, push forward! Greg! Greg! Greg! Got washed out by the water last time. I... I can't go down there. The water's flowing. There's a way through. No, no. Wait. Wait, please. Wait. Please. Wait! Sarah. Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! God. No, no, no. Sarah! - Come. Come. - All right. - It stops here? - It's a dead-end. There's no way through? - No. - Fuck! Fucking water. Hi, baby girl. Hiya. it's Mommy. I... I just wanted to let you know... That I love you. I want you to be good. And kind. And caring. I want you to be a good person. You're so special, baby. Te quiero, Te extraño, baby. My daughter's dead. I know. Everything you just said, you tell it to her face. We're not dead yet. Come on. We'll keep moving. Juno! Juno, I'm here to help you. Get you out. You hear me? I'm here with Sarah. Sarah! God. What the fuck is this? I don't know. Now I wish I was back in the water. What are these things? Death. Your friends, they're all dead? Yeah. How the fuck did you find this hellhole? Juno brought us here. She wanted us all to discover it. She said she wanted to name it after me. - Why? - Guilt. What happened between the two of you? My husband. She had an affair with my husband. What happened to her? It was just Juno and me left. Those things were coming for us, so I hurt her so I could get away. She left my friend Beth dying. Alone. When I found Beth, I had to put her out of her misery. Save your torch. No, Juno, wait! Wait! We came to get you out! Juno. Sarah brought us back down here. She brought us back. Juno. Sarah is your friend. - So you're the rescue party? - We're what's left. - Come on. We gotta get out of here. - Okay, listen to me. Listen. Those things hunt above ground. I think I know which way they go. They must have a route to the surface. So, let's go. Wait a minute, so what? We go to where they feed? Are you fucking kidding me? Do you want to live? Silence is your best weapon. - Follow me. - We're following the water. I ain't going in no goddamn water. Juno knows the way out. So how come you're still here? Because my light died, I had no equipment, and my climbing partner put a pick through my leg and ran out on me... There isn't time for this, God damn it! We want to get out of here alive, we follow Juno. No fucking way. God damn it! I brought you into this hellhole, I'm taking you out. - Wait! - What? it's no good. - Chief! - Shut up, Rios. Let's move. Come on. It's... We'll have to go single file. Spread your weight. Keep it steady. Easy, easy. We really should do this one at a time. You ran out on her, but you ain't running out on me, so let's get going. Shit! - Help me! - Give me the bag. Juno, help me, please! Juno! My arm! Pull me up! Grab my pick. Okay. Okay. - Cut. - What? Cut what? Cut it, or they'll both die! Just fucking cut it! - Do it now! - Wait! Wait! Hurry! Hurry! Fuck. Okay. We gotta move. We gotta go. Rios. Sarah. Let's go. Come on. Come on! - I can't... - No. I'm so sorry. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. It's okay. Sarah. Sarah, we can't stay here. Sarah. We have to get out of here now. Sarah. Please. Come on.
