♪♪ ♪♪ [continues] you are so sexy. No, you are. How about me and you go to your room? Now? But I'm having too much fun. Come on. I'll make it worth your while. I'll make it worth your while if you wait. [giggles] whoa. [giggling] okay, you've had too much. Okay, up we go. You're good. I'm so sleepy. I know, I know. Just try to get some sleep. Stay. I gotta go. Besides, you wouldn't be much fun like this anyways. You can't drive. I've been drinking water. I'll be fine. Recite the alphabet backwards. I don't think I could do that completely sober. Z, y, x... W, v, u, t... S, r, p, o... [engine starts] [siren blaring] [siren chirps] eric: No, no, no! Really? Hi, officer. Mm-hmm. Have you been drinking tonight, son? You wanna hang with me and brett tonight at the bar and grill? Heard they got those video poker machines, and they never check ids. Nah, bro, I got so much work to do. Tony: You know, you used to be a lot more fun before your dui. Eric: Yeah, tell me about it. Sorry, eric. I need to pick up my little brother. I'll catch you later. Coach: Hey, eric! Hey, eric! Hey! Yeah, sorry, coach. - You all right? - Yeah. Good. I want to talk to you about something. What's up? Well, I don't want you to think that your play's gone unnoticed. And your leadership too. Help be an example to these younger players. Thanks, coach I don't wanna put any pressure on you, but you should know that I've gotten some inquiries. Inquiries? College scouts. Assistant coaches over at state and briarcliff. They check the box scores, and they've heard good things. Thanks, coach. Keep it up. I will. But, eric... Grades, man, come on. I know, coach. It's just math. It's so hard. Not saying you need to be a rocket scientist, all right? But you need to pass. If I'm forced to throw you off the team, you're not only letting down me and your teammates, but you could be blowing a golden opportunity for yourself. This isn't division one football. No college is gonna touch a soccer player with academic issues. Just take care of business. Yes, sir. Don't wanna have this conversation again. - Yeah. - Okay? Go hit those books. Jess: How was practice? Fine. In fact, coach said some college scouts have been asking about me. For real? Yeah, but don't get too excited. It's not like I'm gonna be a professional soccer player. Still, scholarship money. Yeah, I guess. I'm so proud of you. Let's get you home. - Sure you don't wanna come in? - Your mom's probably home. - So? - Your mom hates me. She doesn't hate you at all. She's just protective. She blames me for what happened. Okay, well, then I will see you tomorrow. I love you. Bye. Bye. Mom? In the kitchen. Hey, son. How was your day? Not bad. How was yours? Fine. Only thing is, I'm probably gonna be on the road a lot the next few months. We're opening facilities in salton springs and brunswick. - Overnights? - Some. But mostly long day trips, so get used to making your own dinner. That's okay. I think I can order pizza just as easily as you can. Okay, wise guy. Jess bring you home? Of course. Hmm. Something you want to say, mom? What could I possibly want to say? Things wouldn't be going so well for me if it wasn't for jess. If it wasn't for jess, you wouldn't be in this mess in the first place. Come on, mom. That's not true, and you know it. You really want to have this conversation right now? What conversation? The one where you blame jess for everything, even things that were my fault. It was her fault, it was her party, so she is responsible for what went on. Oh, come on, mom. There are over a hundred parties at over hundred different houses over the year. This one was no different. This one was different! And you should know that better than anyone. What if you had hurt someone? What if you had gotten killed? - None of that even happened. - But it could have! And that's my point, son. And what about me? Did you ever stop to think about me? As a minor, you are my responsibility. You hurt, or god forbid, kill someone, then I get sued. We could lose everything. What if your father was here? What would he have to say? He'd probably tell you to leave me the hell alone! [class bell ringing] okay, guys. I know we have a lot to do today. But first, I want to hand back your quizzes because if some of your scores are any indication of your comprehension of that last chapter, we really need to review some things. Can I help you? Hi. Sorry. I transferred here at the beginning of the week, but they told me I should be in your class. Fantastic. We're happy to have you. Why don't you come in and have a seat. Uh, miss? Your name? Oh, um, emily. Emily miller. Emily miller, welcome. Class, emily miller. And this is intro to calculus. Paula, here you go. Eric. As I was saying, these test scores were really low. We may need to go over this chapter again. Anyone needs additional help, please come see me during my office hours. Principal: I assume you know why I want to speak to you. I know, okay? I'm doing the best I can. Then do better. Look, eric, I spoke to coach lerner. In this situation, not either one of us has any discretion. It's black or white. You fail, you're off the team. It's out of your hands. I'll pass, principal callahan. I have to. Look, eric, I know that things are not easy. Now, if this is about your father pass-- everything single problem is because my father's dead. I just meant if things are tough at home, if that's what's going on, well, then we have resources available. Hello. Oh, hey! Emily, right? I'm eric. I know. You're lucky you just got here today. That quiz we got back was killer. Actually, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. It seems like you could use some help, and I can help you. Help me? Tutor you. Calculus is my thing. Well, I couldn't really pay you. Oh, no, I couldn't accept money. You introduce me around to your friends. Transferring mid-year, it's kinda hard to meet people, especially for me. Well, I can do that. So when do we start? Um, why not right now? Oh, well, I have soccer practice right now and then dinner. But I could go to the library tonight. It's a date. One other thing: I sort of don't have a ride there. Don't worry. I'll pick you up. See you tonight? Oh, hey! Don't you need my address? Jess: Are you heading out? I'm heading to the library. - Want me to meet you there? - No, I... Actually, you wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. I'm getting tutored. Calc is kicking my ass. Coach even said something about it to me. I actually think that's a great idea. Yeah, well, my tutor is some new girl who in the class. She offered. Ooh, should I be jealous? - No, you-- - [horn honking] oh, jess, I gotta go. Talk to you later? Yeah, sounds good. Hi. Hi. Wow! Okay, you look nice. I didn't know what to wear. The library's pretty informal. Thanks again for taking me. I appreciate it. No car, huh? Well, I had one. In the shop? It's a long story. Okay, well, the library's ten minutes away. I... At the last party jess threw, I had a bit too much to drink. I thought I was fine to drive. Turns out I wasn't. I was driving home. I guess I was swerving a lot. Just driving pretty dangerously. Luckily, a cop pulled me over before I hurt someone. But I did lose my license. In a end, I think it was a blessing in disguise. How so? I mean, I was partying way too much anyways. My grades were down. I was playing like crap. It was a wake-up call. So I got my license suspended and a year of probation. I try to stay out of trouble till then, my record's clean. Your parents must have been furious. Yeah, my mom was. My dad passed away a few years ago. And yeah, she was royally pissed. She's still holding it over my head in a way. I don't have any parents. Emily, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. My dad was killed in a car accident, but I was too young to remember him. So for a while, it was just my mom and me. And then she left me for... She left me. So now I live with my grandmother. But I've never met anyone who knows what that's like. But you know. You know. So if the input of the function represents time, then what does the derivative represent? Change? Right, but in relation to what? - Time. - Exactly! Let me tell you, I could listen to mr. Lloyd go over this for hours and still not get it right. I'm sure you would. It's just that he's forced to use the common core, which actually makes it harder to understand. Or I just think you're a really good tutor. Okay, well, let's concentrate. Emily, I don't know how to even thank you for this. Well, let's see how you do on your next test first. Better. That, I can promise. I have a confession to make. Oh? I asked to be transferred into lloyd's class. Okay. Why? Because of you. Me? I saw you at soccer practice. On my first day. I think you saw me. I did. And then I saw you talking to your coach about your grades. You didn't see me, but I was nearby, and I saw you. Um, emily, there's something you should know. I have a girlfriend. I know. - You do? - Yeah. Yeah, of course. I've seen you guys together. Plus, a soccer star who looks like you do, I assumed you couldn't be single. Then... Thank you again. I'll see you tomorrow? [door closes] ♪♪ [ominous] [class bell ringing] oh! My savior. Jess, this is emily, who I told you about. Emily, this is jess. The girlfriend. Thank you so much for helping him. God knows I couldn't have. Math isn't really my thing. Well, school isn't really my thing. He knew it all. He just needed a little moral support. I don't know if you know, but seniors are allowed to leave campus for lunch. We're heading to nino's. It's a pizza shop. Yeah, yeah, I know that place. I transferred from st. Peter's, and we used to go there all the time. Well, if you want to join us... Oh, no, no, I couldn't. You guys have fun. I would just be the third wheel. It's fine, really. There'll be other students there. I could introduce you. It's tough meeting people in the middle of the year. I've done okay so far. Jess, we should probably just go grab a quick bite ourselves. Okay, whatever. What's that? Oh, it's my epipen for bees. Haven't needed to use it yet, but you never know. Apparently when I was like three or something, I got stung and blew up like a blimp. Well, you can never be too careful. Tony: Yeah! Here's to kicking south river's butt this weekend! Whoo! And here's to getting some booty after! Uh-huh! What's up, dude? Nothing. Jess. Where the hell is she? On her way, apparently. Dude, you have to try this. Come on, man. You know I can't do that. Come on. You're not driving or anything. What are they gonna do, take away your bicycle? Ha ha. Dude, seriously. You've gotta quit punishing yourself. It was no big deal. You served your time. You're allowed to have some fun. Especially before the old ball and chain gets here. Hmm. I second that. Come on. Celebrate. Uh... It'll be our little secret. Okay, gimme that. All right! Wait. What is this? Oh, just my own little special concoction. A little grain alcohol, little bit of this, little bit of that, a little more grain alcohol. You like? Yeah, I do. Stay put, hombre. Let me go and make you one more. And you come with me. Screening your calls? Jess, when did you get here? I've been calling and texting you. Oh, uh, it's a little loud, jess. Milk, I assume? Relax, will you? It's one drink. Look, it's not like I'm an alcoholic or something. We're at a party. I can't drive anyway. What could happen? What could happen? Where have I heard that before, right? I don't know where you could've heard it before because if I remember, you were too drunk to hear anything. I remember telling you to stay. Yeah, for my own well-being, I'm sure. If it makes you feel better making me feel worse, then go ahead. It's one night, jess. One night. Look, we're at a party, for crying out loud. Then enjoy yourself, eric, but I'm not gonna stand here and watch you throw everything away. Hey, jess, wanna taste something that'll make you forget my name? The hell's up her butt? Don't worry about it, dude. [distant laughter and chatter] I didn't think tony would let you out of his sight. I didn't want to be with tony. I wanted to be here with you. Listening to my problems? Why not? I'm a good listener. That, you are. It's just that... At first, I'm this huge disappointment, you know? Then I finally get my life back together, and everybody starts telling me that they're depending on me. It's like, "what the hell? Can't I just be?" ah, screw it. I'm just drunk. Maybe. But losing a parent or both parents, it doesn't automatically mean that you have to live your life for them. And a lot of people don't understand that. No, they don't. People suck. Yeah, they do. Emily, I-I can't do this. But you know you want to. I mean, you're smart and nice and... Really pretty. I... I'm just so drunk. That's why you kissed me? Because you're drunk? No, no, of course not. That's not what I mean. Emily, I gotta go. Hey! Was it something I said? What? I'm just messing with ya. It's emily, right? - What do you want? - Hey, chill out. I sit across the room from you in calculus, and I just wanted to say hey. Great. You've said it. I gotta go. Hey, what's the hurry? There's an empty bedroom upstairs. So how about you and I go work on some calculus, huh? Tyler was it? You ever lay a hand on me again, you are a dead bitch. [knocking] hi. Eric: I'm sorry. Okay, I'm stupid. I... I was just having fun for one time. Jess: Eric... Jess: Come on. [doorbell rings] you ready? Yeah. Hold on a sec. [beeping] okay. Let's go. It's just that, well, what happened at the party... Just that that can't happen again, emily. Yeah, you made that pretty clear on Saturday. Look, if there was no jess, then... But there is. - And she and I share this-- - look, I get it. Okay, it's not really a big deal. We both probably had a little too much to drink at the party, so let's just forget it even happened, okay? Yeah. But this? Are you still okay with this? Totally. I mean, I love hanging out with you, and if I'm being completely honest, I couldn't find a better tutor. I've gone up a whole letter grade since we started. Well, then let's get back to business. [buzzing] [line ringing] hey, it's me, jess. You know what to do. [beep] hey, you're late. And you're never late. Love you. Anyway... [line ringing] hey, it's me, jess. You know what to do. - [beep] - hey, it's me again. Don't know what the hell happened, if you forgot or... I mean, I hope everything's okay, but I couldn't wait any longer. I don't know why you're not answering your phone, but if you're just running late, I'm walking down elm and over to willow. Bye [ringing] hey, where are you? Eric, is that you? It's jess's mom. Oh, mrs. Brand, I'm sorry. Is everything okay? [distant siren blaring] come in. Don't worry. I won't sting you. Oh, my god, jess. Are you okay? I'm fine. I used the epipen before I got here, and now they're just pumping me full of benadryl. What happened? Your mom said you were stung. Over a dozen times, mainly on my arms. The bees just-- wasps, honey. The wasps... Apparently got in the car during the night. The doctor who saw me says it happens all the time. They stung you in your car? Yup. Thank god you were still home. Thank god. Sweetheart, I'm going to go join your father in the cafeteria for a cup of coffee. Something tells me that you two want to be alone. [kiss] mmm. You taste sweet. Like honey from the bees. Wasps. You heard my mom. They don't make honey. They just sting like 'em. Well, they picked you because you're so sweet. Oh, you're such a goofball. [chuckles] knock, knock. Emily, what are you doing here? I heard what happened, and I just had to come by. How are you? I'm fine, actually. All things considered, it could've been a lot worse. Emily, how did you hear about what happened? I heard some of the girls talking about it, but I didn't get any details, so I just got really worried, and I had to come by. I texted bree and cami what happened, just so they wouldn't worry. Can I get you anything? Is there anything I can do? No, um... I'm really okay, but, emily, it's... It's really thoughtful of you to come. Of course. It's the least I can do. I don't know too many people still, so any friend of eric's is a friend of mine. Listen, you should probably be getting some rest, so I should probably head out. No, no. It's really okay. I'll walk you out. Feel better. I'm just gonna go walk her out real quick. I'll be right back. Hey, what the hell are you doing? I told you-- you're hurting me. I told you. I heard what happened, so I had to come. But why did you come? I don't really understand what you're asking me. I mean, jess is not your friend. She's my girlfriend. I thought I made that clear. Eric, this isn't about you. Don't be so self-centered. Not everything is about you. That poor girl was just stung by a bunch of wasps, and all you can think about is us? I'm leaving. Sorry I'm so late. Everything okay? Yeah. Thanks. Okay. Now, as we discussed, cavalieri's principle is used when calculating the volume of... Come on, guys. A sphere. - Hey, man. - Yo. I never got to ask. How's jess? She's okay. They probably even released her by now. Yeah. I heard those bees got to her pretty bad. That's messed up. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, well, tell her I said hey. I will. Mom, I'm home. We're in here, honey! Eric, it seems as if you've been keeping a little secret from me. A "b'" [laughs] honey, I always believed in you, but I'll admit, I never expected you to raise your grade so quickly. He just needed some extra practice. And the right tutor. I was telling emily that I would have loved to met her sooner, but, you know, I've been so busy. We have to get to the library anyway. No, no, no, no! That's just a waste of time. I've got a business dinner, so you kids can have the house to yourselves. I'll be out of your way in a jiffy. She's amazing. We just had the best talk. You're so lucky, eric. Emily, what are you doing here? What do you mean? We have a tutoring session today. No, we don't. And besides, after everything that happened today, don't-- emily, why were you at the hospital today? We've been through this, eric. I don't understand what you're so angry about. You don't understand? Emily, this morning I find out my girlfriend has a life-threatening reaction, so I show up to the hospital to see if she's okay, and suddenly you show up out of nowhere-- okay, kids! Don't study too hard. You know what they say. - All work and... - No play? Exactly. Eric, I just had that key made for you, so if you lose it again, you're sleeping on the porch. I lost it once, mom. - Once a month. - It's on the keychain. I swear, he'd lose his head if it wasn't attached. But I love you anyway. And you? I won't be late, son. So... What were you and my mom talking about? Oh, I don't know. You, mainly. Hmm. About the right kind of girl for you. I can only imagine. Hey, I'm sensing a little hostility from you, eric. Oh, are you? Gee, emily, I wonder why. I don't know, eric. Could it be because I've been sacrificing my time and energy to tutor you, raising your grade so not only can you stay on the soccer team, but also remain eligible for a possible scholarship? Or could it be because you came onto me at a party in a drunken stupor and then threw me away when you realized it was a mistake, and I was still nice enough to continue to help you? Or is it because I actually had the heart to visit your own girlfriend in the hospital after a life-threatening wasp sting? How'd you know it was wasps? You said wasps. How'd you know that? Well, it was, wasn't it? Even this morning when you showed up, you said you heard she got stung by wasps. That's pretty specific, don't you think? Usually, people would just assume it was bees. And at school, I asked around. Yeah, the girls knew that she was stung, but they thought it was bees. That's what jess told them because at the time, that's what jess thought. I... I just assumed. Hmm. Look, I don't really know where this is going, eric, but if I were you, I would think long and hard about what you say to me. What's that supposed to mean? Exactly what I said. Now, if you don't mind, I don't really wanna help you today. Maybe not just today. What? Maybe this should be it for us, tutoring. Look, I appreciate everything you've done for me, really, but... I think this is for the best. Coach: All balls moving all the time! Let's go! Make it strong! Look alive! Let's go! Hustle, hustle, hustle! - [blows whistle] - hustle up! Over here! Here you go. Nice! [alarm beeping] [beeping stops] [door chimes ring] [jess clears throat] oh, jess. Sorry. I didn't see you come in. No kidding. Can I get you a slice or a coke or something? No, I'm good. So why'd you want to meet here? I'm not paranoid, eric, and you know I'm not the jealous girlfriend type, but... Recently I feel like you've been different, like distant ever since I got out of the hospital. Did I do something, and I don't realize it? No, of course you didn't. But I'm not imagining it, am I? Let's go for a ride. Okay. Jess: Okay, spill it. [sighs] the wasps and the bees, I don't think that was an accident. I think it was emily. Emily? Why? I think she has a crush on me. Of course she has a crush on you. What? You're sweet, you're charming, you're the star of the soccer team. You're not terrible to look at. [chuckles] she just moved here, she doesn't have many friends, and she's been spending a ton of time tutoring you. I'm not surprised. I am, however, surprised that you're just now figuring this out. But lots of people have crushes. That doesn't explain why you think she tried to kill me. Look, last weekend at the party, after we had that huge argument, and you left, I was angry at you. Angry at myself. I had been drinking a lot. She was there. - Eric... - Jess, I'm so sorry. Did you sleep with her? No! Of course not. How far? Come on, jess. Don't do this. How far? It was just a kiss. Just a two-second kiss, and I ended it, and I told her it can never happen again. Look, if you can't forgive me, I understand. Of course I can forgive you. Really? But that doesn't mean that I'm not pissed off, mainly on how you handled everything. I know. I know I screwed up. Still, you think she tried to kill me because the two of you shared a two-quick-second kiss? I mean, that seems a little farfetched. I know, but then she showed up to the hospital almost like she was trying a little too hard. And then yesterday, I come home to find her at my house, talking to my mom. Let me guess. Your mom loves her. I mean, she did help me raise up my grades. Yeah, and she's not me. Look the point is, she knew you were stung by wasps. So? Wasps, not bees. How would she know that? So what do we do? I-I don't know. Mom, what's wrong? Nothing, honey. I'm fine. You don't look fine. Come on, what happened? Today. The date. You remember what it is? Oh. I'm sorry, mom. I just... I just forgot. No. It's healthy. You can't go on thinking about him all the time. You got to live your life. How many years would it have been? Today would have been our 20th wedding anniversary. How about we look at some old photo albums, maybe pop one of those dvds from the old parties? Thank you, son. I think I just need to be alone. - Love you, mom. - I love you too. - Eric? - Yeah? Remember the other day when I said, "what would your father think?" don't worry about that, mom. We were just angry. I know exactly what he would have thought. He would be just as proud of you as I am. Night, mom. Good night, son. Emily! What the hell? What? You were so comfortable. What are you doing here? I missed you. And I know you didn't mean what you said to me last time. How did you get in here? Don't you like what you see? Come on, eric, you don't have to act like this. We're supposed to be together. Come on. Let's go! - You're hurting my arm. - Shh! - You'll wake up my mom. - So? Eric, no one will be happier for us than she will. Come on, you know that. You know she doesn't like jess. She told me so. And she also told me that she would love for you to find someone smart and kind and caring. Come on, let's tell her. Come on, eric! It's our destiny. Mom: Eric, is that you? Uh, yeah. It's nothing, mom. Give me the key. Emily, give me the key, or I swear to god, I will call the cops. Now get dressed. And I want my clothes back, emily. - Come on. - Eric, eric. Shh! Eric... - Eric, please. - Goodbye. Eric, I need to speak with you for a few minutes. I'm going to be late to english. I'm afraid this is a bit more important. Somebody wanna tell me what's going on? Do you know a student named emily miller? She recently transferred to clearbrook. Yeah, of course. She's been tutoring me in calculus. Ms. Miller has accused you of sexually harassing her. She filed a report with her guidance counselor this morning. Nobody's saying that you did this, eric, nobody. But in today's climate, we have to take each and every one of these sexual accusations seriously. Did you harass ms. Miller at all? Even if it's something that you think was just innocent? No, of course not! What did she say I did? Because of confidentiality, I'm not able to get into the specifics of the accusation. Did you have any contact, any sexual contact with her whatsoever? No. We... She's just been tutoring me. Well, ms. Miller doesn't want to press any formal charges against you, and she claims that her grandmother, who's her legal guardian, she doesn't want that either, but you're gonna have to keep away from her. Just leave her alone. No more tutoring. In fact, if I were you, I would have no contact with her at all. That's fine. I don't want anything to do with her. Good, because you need to think about your reputation here. About the team, about your future. If something like this gets out-- can I go now, please? Actually, ms. Callahan, you mind if I have a word alone with eric? Sure. It's just me and you now, bud. I can help you, but I need you to tell me the absolute truth. Coach, I am. I told you everything. I didn't touch her. Emily came to me first. She showed me her arm, showed me the bruises. Bruises? Wha-- no, no, that's from when she snuck-- when she was in my room-- coach, can I see the report, please? [sighs] [class bell ringing] stays between us? Yeah. I'll stay away from her, coach, but who's gonna make sure she does the same to me? I I don't understand why you didn't explain everything. Yeah, 'cause I'm sure they would believed me. - I would've backed you. - Just the two of us? Our word against hers. Can you imagine? The jock who's on probation with a suspended license is all of a sudden getting harassed by little miss perfect. The wasps. We didn't make that up. We still don't even know if that was her, jess. Well, we know one thing for sure. What's that? That by breaking into your house and then going to the principal, clearly she's messed up, and this probably isn't the first time she's done this. Coach? - You spoke to eric, I assume? - I did. We took your complaint very seriously, miss miller. I didn't want him expelled or anything. I just wanted to know that he knew he couldn't treat me like that. Because, you know, he really is a very special guy. Regardless, I hope you understand how serious these accusations are, and I have a duty and a responsibility to act on them accordingly. What do you mean, "act accordingly?" exactly what I said. Look, this day and age, we all have to err on the side of caution. This is a legal matter now, miss miller, not just an administrative one. All I said was that he got a little aggressive. I didn't say he was a mass murderer or anything. I understand that, but unfortunately, sometimes good and decent people, they can do bad things, make big mistakes. And by laying his hands on you, that's exactly what eric did here unless... Unless what? Unless you're changing your story. No, I'm not changing my story. All right. Eric won't be bothering you anymore. I assume I can say the same thing about you? I can't believe I didn't do this sooner. You didn't have a reason to. Yup, that's her, all right. She looks so normal. Exactly. Look at that picture right there. Yeah, so? That guy. He's in a lot of these photos. He's wearing a st. Peter's varsity jacket. Here. There we go: Rob o'shea. I bet he knows something about her that we don't. Probably. [phone chiming] oh, I gotta get back to school. I got practice. Okay, let's go. - I'll call when I'm finished. - Will you need a ride later? No. I'll just get one of the guys to take me. What are you about to do? What do you mean? Come on, jess. I know you way too well. I can tell when the wheels are spinning. Just go. Have a good practice, and I'll talk to you later. Okay. [engine starts] rob? Rob o'shea? - Do I know you? - No. No, you don't. My name is jessica brand. Jess. I go to clearbrook. You think we could talk for a few minutes alone? I'm kinda just getting out of practice. It's about emily miller. Emily miller? That's a name I was hoping I'd never hear again. You're not close with her? Not close? [chuckles] that's an understatement. But the pictures of you two together are all over her social media account. Rob: I wish they weren't. Jess: Did you two date or something? Rob: Uh, I mean, emily used to go to st. Peter's. We were friends. She liked to hang out around the soccer team. I liked her. She was nice. Smart. A lot smarter than me, that's for sure. She would always help me with whatever I needed school-wise. - And then... - What happened? Why don't you first tell me what this is all about? It's about my boyfriend. [chuckles] you have a boyfriend. I think she's become infatuated with him. Well, if that's the case, he needs to be very careful. So should you. Is she dangerous? After a while, I started to feel like she wanted something more than I did, so I told her we should cool things down for a bit. She didn't like that, so she started to call me all the time. And I mean all the time, showing up at places where I was, showing up to my house. My parents eventually called the cops. What'd they do? They spoke with her, to her grandmother. That's who she lived with. She doesn't have parents? No, her dad's dead. She grew up with her mom, but she took off with a professional soccer player. The police, when they talked to her, did that help? I mean, she stopped bothering me personally. But for the next couple months, I kept getting calls and then hang-ups from an unknown number. And I'd see someone walking by my place a lot at night. Did you tell the cops? Of course, but they couldn't prove it was her, even if it was obvious. And after the next couple months, I never heard from her again. She never came back to st. Peter's. Well, thanks, rob. You have no idea how much I appreciate this. Just be careful. And can I call you sometime? You know, just in case I think of something else. How about you give me your number, okay? And if I have any more questions, I'll give you a call. Here. I'll put it in my contacts. Thanks, rob. I'll text you if I think of anything else. Hey, see ya. Yo, it's eric. You know what to do. - [beep] - hey, it's me. You're probably still at practice, but call me as soon as you can. You're never gonna guess who I spoke to. [clears throat] what's up, mom? You wanna explain these to me? Uh, they look like pills. Don't be a wise guy. I'm not. What do you want me to say? The truth. You think they're mine? They were on your desk. If they were mine, you think I'd really be that stupid to leave them laying on my desk? What I want to know is what these are and how long have you been using them. I told you. They're not mine! Then whose are they, eric? You wouldn't believe me if I told you, try me. They're emily's. You know that girl you met the other day? She planted them there. Oh, wow. Really, eric? You don't believe me. You think I'm making this up! It was emily who called me about the drugs. She's really worried about you, son. She's afraid that something bad is about to happen. What'd she tell you? That you've been under a lot of stress lately and that you've been using these drugs to deal with it. You and jess. She says that when she confronted you about it, that you said you didn't want her to tutor you anymore. That's why she called me. She manipulating you, mom. She's crazy! Crazy and dangerous. I don't want you seeing jess anymore. I should have said something a long time ago. I don't think you had to. We both know exactly how you felt. And did she tell you what she tried to do to jess, how she tried to kill her? So now you're telling me emily tried to kill jess. If you don't believe your own son, then at least stay out of my way. Eric! Jess: Where have you been? I've been waiting for you to call. Oh, just being called delusional, a drug addict, and a compulsive liar by my mom. What? Don't worry about it. I'll tell you later. I want to hear about what you found out. I have to go to dinner with my parents tonight. Can you meet later? Probably not, but I will. Nino's at 10? Yeah. Love you. Love you too. Hello, rob. Emily. - Expecting someone else? - What are you doing here? Thought that maybe you and I could have a little talk. You followed her, didn't you? - Who? - You know damn well who. Jess? No, rob, I didn't. But unfortunately she won't be coming. She never-- you sent those texts. Why? Because I saw you talking to her, and I need to know what you told her. Why the hell would I tell you that? Because, rob, you know exactly what I'm capable of. Leave me alone, emily. You're nuts. Hey. Why all the hostility? I didn't tell her anything. She just asked some questions about you. I told her we used to date for a little. That's it. Did you tell her how much you enjoyed it? Sorry I'm late. Dinner took forever. I didn't want them giving me a hard time about going out after. Don't worry. I needed to get out of the house anyways. So your mother. Don't worry about that either. I'll tell you later. I wanted to hear what you found out. So I went to st. Peter's, and I spoke to rob o'shea. I knew you were up to something. I had to. I had to find out more information about her. - And? - And she's done this before. With him, maybe others even. It's the same thing, eric, the same thing that she did to you. He was a star athlete. She helped him with school, tutored him. They hooked up, started dating. As soon as he said it was over, she got violent. - Violent? - That's what rob said. Oh, jeez. We have to do something. We have to do something now. It's one thing for her to lie and make up false accusations. Even try to frame me and ruin everything I've worked for. But for her to get violent, it's only a matter of time before she hurts one of us. Or worse. But what can we do? I mean, everything she's done that we know she's done, it's our word against hers. And unfortunately to the people who matter, her word is a lot more reliable. What about this rob guy? He believes us, right? Of course. She did the same thing to him, but what does it matter? It matters because everyone that she's close to knows what she's really like. I'm not sure what you mean. We have to hit her where she's vulnerable. Close to home. - Eric. - Hey, what's up? You didn't hear? Hear what? - About the murder. - What murder? It's all over the local news. Rob o'shea was murdered last night in donaldson park around the same time you and I were together. Do they have any suspect-- I mean, do they know it was her? No suspects. That's what they're saying. They're treating it like a robbery because his wallet was found near his body. We have to go to the cops now and tell them what we know because this is too much. Wait, wait, if we go to them with no proof, what do you think's gonna happen? Even if they do question her, unless she admits it, they'll have to let her go. And then she'll come after us. Tomorrow before school. Like we talked about. That's when we do it. Jess: So as soon as she leaves, we go in, right? Eric: Yeah. Jess: And you're sure this is her address. Eric: Positive. It was on the report. I made sure I wrote it down as soon as I left callahan's office. But what if the grandmother isn't there' where's she going to be at this early in the morning? What if she refuses to talk to us? What if she tells us to get the hell off her property and to leave her alone? Then we're no worse off than we are now. [door opens] look. Let's go. [jiggles doorknob] you expect it to be open? So what are we gonna do, leave? Come on. Look, the grandmother's got to be old. Maybe she just didn't hear us knocking. Maybe. And if you don't answer your door, that just gives someone the right to come in. Coach? Miss miller. Ever heard of knocking? Have you seen eric today? Why? Something wrong? I'm just wondering if you've seen him. I haven't, but if I had to guess, I'd say that he's in class, exactly where you should be. No, he isn't. I checked already. Look, miss miller, even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. But why? Why? Have you completely forgotten our previous conversation? I instructed you to stay away from him. Eric and I are destined to be together. No, you're not. In fact, like we agreed, don't go anywhere near him. Hello? Miss, uh... Mrs. Miller? Shh! What' we don't want to surprise her. Mrs. Miller, the door was open. It's really important, mrs. Miller. We really need to talk to you about emily. Something isn't right. It just doesn't feel like anyone is here. Let's take a quick look around, and then we'll get out of here. Just a look. This is from a nursing home. Looks like a bill. You don't think emily has been living here alone? Only one way to find out. I don't think anyone has been here for a very long time. I don't either. Come on, let's go. This must be her room. Eric: There's gotta be something on this. [wood creaks] oh, my god, eric. Look at this. We gotta get the cops over here now. I don't think so, eric. When both of you weren't at school, I got a little suspicious, and I thought, "where could they both be together?" emily, please. You need help. Help? You want to tutor me, eric? [laughs] we're not gonna hurt you, emily. We just want to leave. No. You're not gonna hurt me. Emily, this is about you and me, not about jess. Please. Let her go, and we can talk about this. This is about me and you. Talk about it? So you can leave me too, just like my mother did? Take off with some young, hot athlete, without even any thought about what would happen to her only daughter? - I never left you. - Shut up! Just shut up! Put the knife down, emily, before you go too far. Too far? I don't think so, jess. I don't think so. I think any reasonable person would think this was self-defense. Don't you, jess? - You breaking into my house-- - you can still get help. I said shut up! If it wasn't for you, he would be all mine right now. All mine! If it wasn't for you, you bitch! You can't get rid of me, eric. I'll always be there. Just when you think you're safe, I'll be watching... At the soccer field, in the classroom, in your house, and the second you put your guard down, the second you think you're safe. I'll be there. Jess: Just leave us alone, emily. There is no "us," jess. Not anymore. I'm back, and I'm taking what is mine. If you stand in the way, I will make you pay. I'll make you pay in ways you can't even imagine. The next time you see my face, it will be the last thing you ever see. [siren blaring] [police radio chatter] teacher: Okay, class, we have a lot to get through today, but first I want to welcome a new student. Jordyn, welcome to timber ridge. Jordyn? Oh, hi. Thank you.
