Satsuki, how have you been? We don't know what changes you have been through. What? It's time. Miko I'm sorry. Where is she?! Chinatsu Stop! Mayu Momomi Amy Killer Pussy Noriko Corsette Angel Satsuki Is everyone well?! Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the battlefield of girls! Tonight they will fight with their lives! Enjoy! Be honest and don't move. This boss lady is up. We are GIRL'S BLOOD! Chinatsu. Aka X Pinku (Red X Pink) Introductions. The table turner, Killer Pussy. The girl in darkness, the Emo fighter, Corsette. Fight! Right! Right! That's how you do it. Emergency! ?Emergency! Amy is up! It's my turn. Be good and wait for me to come back. The valued nurse. The red Angel. Sorry, it's my turn. Fight! Satsuki, I am one of your fans. Do you feel pleasure as I step on you? Oh, yeah! Do it harder! Harder! Hey, there. Let me help you. No. Satsuki! No. Tell me what you like about me. Tell me ten things. Ten things.... Don't. It's embarrassing! Have a taste of this. I won! Everyone's idol, Momomi is on stage. Hello, everyone! One who can't live without S&M, Miko the S&M Queen. Your pretentious smile irritates me. Oh, I don't have a pretentious smile. I am everyone's Peach Beauty. Yesterday, weren't you mud fighting? Bitch. You sure talk a lot of crap. I'm going to kill you. You two ready? Fight! One side's ugly. Damn it. Hurry up! Hurry up! Everyone watch this. Get up. It hurts. All that remains is...Satsuki! And the opponent, The Incarnated Witch, Noriko! Yes, like that! Just like that! I'd like to... I would like to participate. What? "One month later" Welcome. Hey. You're Mayu, right? Yes. I thought you had disappeared from this world. I didn't mean to offend you. I didn't mention your... No need. I'll do it. Sorry. Is someone here? I want to check out. Yes. Pardon me. In the back... In the back... The backdoor is no fun. It's not stimulating enough. You're quite an arrogant slave. Um... Looking for something? No. This...please accept it. Tennoji, you're quite popular with the girls. Don't know how many love letters I've seen. Hey, the word "yearning" is written here. A mailing address too. No. What is so bad? It's such a small thing. No. Refusing something good. 50 yen. How about 100 yen? Hey! What are you doing? Oh, you old pervert. So? I'm a bachelor. Satsuki, good morning. Good morning. Amazing! That's so cool. Next time take Mayu for a ride. No. That was cold. I hate those with no respect for seniority. You obviously hate all things fellow sisters say. Huh, what did you say? Hey, hey, this chick with a washboard chest ain't bad. Stop it, Miko. Calling someone a washboard is too much. We can't be sure. She may be only fourteen. How can you say that? Even fourteen year olds are bigger. Indeed. Stop it, Miko. That little chest is coming out. How old are you girls? Come on! Okay. Come on, washboard. I'm not a washboard! We are GIRL'S BLOOD. This is a women?s' fighting centre built for underground entertainment. The membership entry fee is 10,000 yen. Our members come from different backgrounds. GIRL'S BLOOD has all kind of members. From National Karate contestants to University Judo players. Although only few are adept. Most of them are amateurs. Seven, eight... Okay. It's been only a month, and you have progressed. Thanks a lot. Do it one more time. Two more times. Harder! Okay, you worked hard. Thank you for teaching me. I'll go first. Wait a moment, we're almost done. How about Cheongsam clothing? Your have nice dark hair. We'll call you the Shanghai Lily. Your mantra will be "There will be a way". Hey, fourteen year old. Are you ready? Hurry. Finish her. Roger that. You were serious. Oops, I didn't mean to. Look, do you want to become like that too? Hey, you do you want to eat this? Yes, feed me. Yes, feed me. Do you want some? No? How about a snack? No? Scram. Are you okay? Does it hurt? I'm fine. Get up. Never think it's over. Save me! Well, I guess... Good luck! I need to fight two rounds? I'm tired. Come on. Sorry, Miko. A new girl suddenly joined. Okay, I will do it. But the pay... I know. I know. I will give you extra. Who's the opponent? In this side, the super sadistic beauty queen, Miko! That's the best you got? Louder! In this side, the opponent is from China. Shanghai Lily! Fight! Teacher, her movements... Shit's just got real. What's the background of this Lily girl? I feel like I've seen her before. I think I seen her somewhere... The women's mixed martial arts arena. That explains it. Damn! Are you okay? That girl was no amateur. Of course, I know that! Miko, you need to go to the hospital. I don't want to go. I need a drink. I'll kill her. Just you wait. Step aside. You're still here. You're Satsuki, aren't you? Yes. They said Satsuki was coming here and told me to change faster. If you knew, why didn't you change? You don't like to change with others. You can't? The girls still don't know why you don't change with them. Who are you? I've been waiting for you. Wait. I can't take it off. It's been a while since I fought. I have trouble lifting my elbow. I can't unzip. I can't reach. Why can't you just-- Zipper. My name is Chinatsu. Chinatsu, as in "summer". Okay. The atmosphere doesn't feel good. Miko, I can understand why Satsuki took off. Something funny is going on. I'm sorry, but... The competition has changes. The final match...will be Satsuki versus Lily. Satsuki, kick her ass! Fight! What are you doing? Hit her face! Hit her face! Satsuki, quickly loosen your grip. Awesome fight. Let's die together. Let's die together. As if. See you later. You did your best. You really did. Look at your messed up face. First time, seeing you so impulsive. Now, that's how a girl fights. Leave me alone. Take care of yourself. Don't come near me! Don't look! Don't be startled. I-- You're scaring me. If you don't like it, then I won't look. Get out. Get out! No. Don't stop, Satsuki! I'm cumming. Oh, Chinatsu, don't stop. What are you doing?! Satsuki, how have you been? We don't know what changes you have been through. Mom and dad are tired. Thinking about you and when you will come home. Satsuki, what are you thinking? Still no response. Marriage? Someone proposed to you? I always say no. A customer came to my workplace and proposed. Will you marry me? Will you...please marry me?! Next customer please. Isn't he a stalker? "Mayu, are you okay? "Can you lend me a hand?" It's nothing. I'm used to it. Nothing? You'd never know. Why? It's not your business. Everyone sees Mayu as a child, worrying over me. Is that so? Then do whatever you want. Why are you angry? I'm not angry. The matches piss me off from time to time. It's dangerous to be that way. I guess it's gonna be okay. Why? Because Miko would protect me. I fought the entire night. I'm so tired. I gotta go back and get some rest. Satsuki, is that you? Finished changing yet? The bra is on. Her underwear isn't on yet. You're not doing something in there, are you? How could we? Hurry in. We're dressed. See? Okay, okay. We'll go first. You women sure are slow. Aren't you a woman also? Shut up. Here we go again. Well, you're so impatient, Satsuki. Why are you so agitated? I need to take something off. Don't let me see your chest. Say "Empress Miko, forgive me" three times,? then I'll let it go. Idiot. I say Mayu. Take yours off too. Yes. You take the bottom off. Wait! We just got dressed. Hold your hand. Enough! I'll go change somewhere else. What are you doing this time? Who is that? My husband. Husband? Yes, I left home. I moved around, changed jobs. Yet he still found me. Please, help me. Only you can help me. Come on. How did you end up in this mess with him? I grew up in a big karate household. My husband is also a karate master. I couldn't stand the domestic violence so I ran. Then he found me and now this. This side! Miko. Old-school. Are all these guys black belts? Yeah, that's right. Stand aside, lady. This doesn't concern you. He didn't just say that. Remember, he's killed three people before. You still want trouble? Get them. Damn it. You sure can fight. I participated in the university karate entrance exam during high school. And ended up in the national competition semi finals. I practice every day. You bitch. Chinatsu. Who do you think you are? Out of the way, out of the way... What are you doing?! Bitch! Careful, the whip is sharp. This bitch. People! Help us! Quick! Call the police! I'll remember you. Let's go. Step aside. What are you looking at, bastard? I have to ask. Why does your husband hate women fighting? His wife is immersed crazily in it. He couldn't bear unofficial matches. He said if I continued, he'll kill me. If he had seen your matches, he'd be entangled by your finesse. My husband has a twisted desire. He wants matches with a tightrope walking intensity. I felt I was struggling in the abyss. Soon, I was dying for a release. You guys are fine. Why? Don't look at me. I am an honour student. And I also served as vice president of the student body. I can see that. Miko looks that way. Sure, she does. Parents and teachers expectations are fulfilled regardless. Might as well say I over-fulfilled the requirements. My parents scared me... and then... after high school my parents divorced... a stepfather moved in. "Didn't you say I was a clever kid?" I certainly understood his needs. My stepfather was filthy and a sexually unsatisfied middle-aged man. Unfortunately, my mother saw us together... so I was thrown out. Here, it's the same. I understand our spectators' desires. I feel comfortable here. Your turn. Come here. I've never told this to anyone. Initially, I was afraid to be here. But, I've quickly adjusted. From high school I?ve been babied by everyone. It had been that way til my brother was born. It was my mother's psychological disorder. It could have been fine, but my father neglected it. In fact, I hoped that he would help me. A pat on the head, maybe. In reality, I have issues too. Only during matches, I can forget them. So I stayed here. Come on. What are you doing? Stop behaving like children. Bunch of idiots. You, take it off too. This is crazy. Satsuki, come on. Idiots. I'm not doing it. Don't be afraid. Come on, already. Miko, give it to me. What are you doing? You're a man, aren't you? The first time I saw you, I knew immediately. From when I knew left from right I felt I was a boy. But I felt it was wrong. I didn't know what to do then I stumbled here. Satsuki, why don't we go for a ride? Take me around. In high school, my mother found my porn collection. The kind boys are into. That's unfortunate. She was angry and asked me what was wrong. While my father did help me explain... I couldn't take it and I ran away from home. If I had told the truth maybe my life would've been different. It is not everyone's life. My sudden departure got to my parents, my teachers and friends. They didn't understand the reason I ran away. That for me was painful. Male or female, Satsuki is Satsuki. Don't say that. I hate when people say nice things. Say, I also feel embarrassed. Hey. Ah, wait a moment. Come on. Let me clean this up. Satsuki. You're not gentle, right? Come here, sit. First time? It's also my first time, with someone like you. You don't find it gross? Continue to speak like that and I'll shut you up. Am I the only one that will be naked? You're so beautiful. That's a bit much. I'm scared. Yet touching yourself is fine. Quite headstrong of you. But I want to feel Chinatsu. Of course you can. It'll be great, I promise. Satsuki, you won't be disappointed. Who are you? Damn, these female clothes aren't cheap. Hey You alright? Hey, hey, are you okay? What happened? President, this... Where are you going? Bathroom. No. Don't say these lame couple lines. Then kiss me. Those two went and disappeared again. Mayu, your mud fighting skills are still poor. I'm already out of breath, Miko. Me too. I want to shower already. Great! Kiss me again. What state are you in? It's interesting, let me watch carefully. Want to change to a Intestinal pinch? How does your ass feel? Miko, go on. You see, you see?! No, it's embarrassing. Please stop! She really looks fourteen. Want a shower? I'm scared... Save me... Don't freeze up. I'm scared... Save me... I'm scared... save me... Mayu, don't freeze up on me. Can you stand? Sorry. I secretly came to watch you every night. Because I really wanted to see you. Miko, I... I am going to marry him. Really? That's great. Let's do it then. Let's get out of here. You okay? Mayu... Satsuki is... You are the type that frequently sinks then disappears. Idiot. Thank you, Chinatsu. If I hadn't met you, I would've been alone. What's going on? Last night, something inexplicable happened. Once the two of you were lazy, we were in trouble. Did Miko call you? Last night, Miko was shocked because Mayu left with a boy. After the match, she fell silent. Did you know anything about this? We came in today and ran into a dangerous uncle. He is now speaking with the manager. It seems to be about you. Why did you come here? Chinatsu, how can you wear that jacket? Something wrong? You again? Of course I'm here to pick up my wife, asshole. You girls playing lesbians now? Playing kissy-kissy-kissy, right? Shut up, damn it. Old acquaintance? Ah, it really surprised me. I didn't think Samejima, a former student of Ando would hide in this despicable place as an errand boy. What's going on? Lily is the daughter of legendary master Tai of Ando. Ando Yasumasa? The toughest practitioners, Ando Faction? At first I knew something wasn't right. 20 years ago, the Ando Faction had an violent outbreak for their rights. This guy took advantage of the Ando Faction's debt. He took the only daughter of Ando for himself. Then took over the Ando Faction. People's hearts sure are ugly. Kicked out jealous disciples. Quite ugly indeed. Chinatsu, come home with me. Wait. It's her to decide. Do you want to lose the other leg too? What did you say? Stop. Enough. Disband. Today is the dissolution of Girl's Blood. Operating in violation of customary law. Illegal construction. Illegal occupation. Tax evasion. And there is a issue with countermeasures for earthquakes. These are all our problems. Since you have collected so much evidence, there is nothing more I can say. What I did has nothing to do with Girl's Blood. Reporting and supervision are obligations of good citizens. You and your despicable ways! You bastard. Are you OK? Chinatsu. It hurts. She can't escape my grasp. Out of the way! Hold it! Hold it! Out of the way! Chinatsu! No! No! Don't move. Take off your clothes. No! No! It hurts. Shut up. Hey, open your mouth. Hey. Yes? Go have some fun. Stop. Don't push me. This is not the boss' intention. Making me clean? Do you know the consequences? I know, Empress. Why do you want that, pig? I'm hard to handle, right? Not hard to handle, Empress. Really dishonest, huh? Will Empress listen to the request of this dirty servant? Tell me, pig. Go to hell. You go to hell. Now, I'm going to take your petty life. First, pay for my services, bitch! Hey, hold onto her. Right now, I just want to beat the shit out of you. Where is Chinatsu? Where?! Rape is not part of the services. Empress. Let's go, Chinatsu. You can't stay with scum like him. Who are you? Get away from her, you bastard! I don't understand what you're saying, Sister. Let's go, Chinatsu. This person is scaring me. Scary? You're breaking into private property. Get out. Throw her out. Don't go and we'll call the police. Come on, come on. Chinatsu, Chinatsu. Hold on. Take this shit with you. Let's go. You lied to me, Chinatsu. Thanks. I went to the old Ando Faction place Samejima was from. The people there said they were disbanded. Can't mess with those guys. Satsuki, are you okay? You, Miko? Whatever. Mayu, Chinatsu... and everyone else are gone. Occasionally, guests come to see me play S & M. I'm used to the beatings. Constant beatings may condition you into a masochist puppet. Again! Hey. It hurts. It's your fault for not listening to my words. Apologize. I can't hear you! Beg for mercy. Please spare me. Beg for mercy! Please spare me. Want a beating? No. It's all my fault. Chinatsu, you are such a bad girl. Yes It's your fault. Hurts? You made a fool out of me. You want to fight me? You want to endure a beating? Understand? Yes, thank you. No, no. I'm bad, I'm bad! Say that you like it. Quick! Shout it. Miko. I slept with Chinatsu. Really? Your heart is even more upset now. Aren't you surprised? Frankly, about your male gender or whatever, you and Chinatsu sleeping together. Both of those things. They surprised me. Really? I was pretending not knowing about your relationship blossoming. We don't really see the forest for the trees. I saw past the forest. But have yet to see myself. Miko, do you love Mayu? I just said I don't know. But I've always felt I couldn't abandon her. Before I didn't like matching up against you. I always felt you were very calculating. Always paying attention to the eyes of the spectators. Thinking about what to do to please them. In order to win that desperately, to me, is quite sad. In this case, you shouldn't blame me. Martial arts is used to understand one?s self. Miko, what fighting style do want to bring out? Because you aim to meet the expectations of others, you lose yourself. Sorry for being frank. Things lately got to my head and I've said too much. It's nothing. Don't you have a fighter that you admire? Miriko. Nickname "Fast-legs." I like his standing techniques. I don't want my skills to deteriorate. I'd like to be like that. To be a master like him, able to employ flexible techniques to take down opponents win by a landslide. See, you have something you want to do. It's fortunate to have one's own fighting technique. Same to you. We can't just let them take the dojo. There must be a way to protect GIRL'S BLOOD. You want me to let you off? As an ex-model student of this dojo, aren't you ashamed? Excuse, my frankness. But, this dojo... doesn't rely on GIRL'S BLOOD. But, there are a lot of girls that do. Come on, when someone begs... they should kneel. I beg you. Wrong. Wrong! Excuse me. Hey, what are you doing, Samejima? President. Forget it. I'm looking to discuss a little something with you. Does Andos want an open match with GIRL'S BLOOD? Winner are kings and losers are beggars. If you win, we obediently disband. And the entire venue goes to you. On the contrary, if we win, GIRL'S BLOOD will continue. What do you think? You daydreaming all of a sudden? Why do you think we would have a fair contest with you?! No? That's strange. We are the Andos. Why would we have a match with you idiots and ruin our reputation?! Hey, take care of them. Hey, don't think it's over, asshole. Had quite a happy time with high school students, didn't you? This is trashy stuff. Imagine the media with this. Who's playing whom now? We got heaps more by the bundle. What the hell are you looking at?! Quite impressive. A model of sportsmanship. A youth karate club adviser. You and the Chairman of the Board of Education are quite close. If the photos gets out, even money won't settle things. What do you suggest? What do you suggest?! I know. Where are you sitting?! Alright. It seems we have a deal. Osu! Let's go. Wait! If you have blackmail over me, then an open match is pointless. Why bother fighting? Because it's interesting. Hey, how did you persuade the president? Kink. Empress Miko. Don't worry about it. Do you intend to return with us? You can say I'm awake now. I was silly, knowing why I was with someone like you... Well, it's not worth mentioning. Though it was a lie, I'm genuinely happy that you once told me that you were willing to die with me. I'll see you in the ring. Does it taste good? Mayu say it tastes good. Mayu say it feels comfortable. Yes. The "yes" this time is so cute. Don't you want to ask me the reason why I want to leave? I want you to know. I want you to completely understand me. It's too hard. I can't handle it. Mayu, what are you doing? I thought our encounter was a miracle. But, my life must go on. Goodbye. Wait, Mayu! Mayu! Faster! Good. Very good. Yes. That's how you kick! I left without saying anything. Sorry. Mayu. You love me, don't you? Miko. I say. Why don't you greet us? Ladies and gentlemen! You, the audience, are very fortunate this evening. Tonight is a matter of life and death for GIRL'S BLOOD. A special match. GIRL'S BLOOD VS ANDOS! If we lose tonight, GIRL'S BLOOD will disband. But if we win... Then we would become an official match holding arena! Let's enjoy! Mayu. Do your best. Good. Don't lose your concentration! Mayu! Mayu! Stop it! Mayu. It hurts! Let's keep fighting. Mayu. Do you want to continue? Mayu. Miko. Mayu tried her best. Kept up till the end. I saw it. Mayu fought beautifully. Miko! Hey Empress. You know you're gonna lose. Why bother fighting? I will not lose to you. I just see your bitch face as unsightly. You don't know good from bad. Go home and be a good little girl. Miko, what fighting style do want to bring out? Because you aim to meet the expectations of others, you lose yourself. Miko! Come on, Miko! Miko, Miko, Miko, Miko!... Yes! Louder, louder! Louder! This is what I want to do! I won! Begin! Yes! Chinatsu's a cruel one! Awful, just awful! Satsuki's going to die. Chinatsu, be my woman. Who do you think you are? Be my woman! It's really bad. Your inability to live without others is self-destructive. We need to fight out of our own cages. I've always wanted to experience this. Me too. Chinatsu, I want to see it together with you. Stand up, Chinatsu. Chinatsu, stand up! Stand up. I didn't call you! Get back down! Yes! Amazing! Chinatsu, I love you. Kiss me. GIRL'S BLOOD wins! GIRL'S BLOOD! GIRL'S BLOOD! GIRL'S BLOOD! GIRL'S BLOOD! GIRL'S BLOOD! GIRL'S BLOOD! Um. I want to go inside too. Hey, Satsuki, where are we going? I won't tell you. It doesn't matter. I'd be with you to face whatever is ahead. I knew it. I'm back. It's good to see you again.
