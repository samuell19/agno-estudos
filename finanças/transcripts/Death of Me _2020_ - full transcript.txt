...been keeping a very close eye on the typhoon over the last few days. It always was forecast to be a very powerful, violent typhoon, and that's turned out to be exactly the case, and you can see it clearly here on the satellite. See of course the eye very well defined, and around the eye, well, we've got some very ferocious wind that's been causing incredible damage. Gusts have been up to around about 320 kilometers an hour, and it may landfall pretty much at its peak, and those gusts of winds, well, throwing the large objects around, causing, uh, structural damage, widespread destruction. And it's not finished yet. The typhoon right now is quite far away, with winds in the eye wall that could exceed over 200 kilometers per hour. The typhoon is due to make landfall in 12 hours. That's 7 p.m. local time. You need to evacuate if you're in the path of the typhoon immediately. Neil. Neil. Neil, are you okay? Neil. Honey. Neil. Oh, my God. Look at this room. Oh, my God. Neil, we're late! Neil, seriously, get up! ...large and violent typhoon makes its way across the South China Sea. ...make landfall in Vietnam on Sunday. That really is the one to watch over the next few days. Thank you, Michael. The typhoon right now is quite far away. However, if you live in this zone over here, you should be careful. Oh, that doesn't look good. ...could potentially make a direct hit. The typhoon is due to make landfall in 12 hours... Is that blood? What happened last night? If you're in the path of the typhoon, you need to evacuate, get yourself somewhere safe. Do you think we'll still make the boat? Yeah, we'll make it. Did you buy me this? I have no idea. Doesn't really look like either of our tastes. You know, I can't even remember how we got back to the room last night. Can you? No. The important thing is we did, so good for us. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, wait. This isn't right. He has to turn towards the water to get to the ferry. Sir. Uh... pai taing qua... to ferry. What did he say? Something about a festival. Do you know of any festival? San Khabuga, but it's not for another two weeks. Oh, well, then he's padding the fare by going the long way. Hey, yeah, yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Rae... rae ka pe sei saam rap. Okay? Yeah? We pay you extra for direct. Could you slow down, please? I-I can't... Hey, buddy, lis... Mi mae cha sakaal. Okay, no... no festival. Okay? No festival. Yes, ferry. No festival. - Ferry. - Wait. What is he doing? You, get out! No, no, no. Sir, sir, we're sorry. We have to get to the ferry, okay? If you want more money, we'll pay you. No, no, no, no, no. Lakaa thos chanmi nuei. Yeah? You get out! Get out! My passport and my wallet are in here. - You sure? - Your passport, too. And where is my fucking phone?! - What... - Hey, madame, no I.D., no board. No, no, no. Come on. Sorry. Next, please! Okay, let's just retrace our steps. When was the last time you had your passport? Well, I paid for dinner, remember, and then I put it away. I never touched it again. Oh, no. Did I leave it in the room? It's okay. Don't worry about it. - I'm so stupid. - We'll figure it out. It's okay. W-We'll figure something out. I'm sorry, but we are already late getting under way. If you find your I.D., there is another boat at 7:00. Well, what about the storm? That's land. No, I saw it on TV. There's a hurricane or a typhoon coming. No, no, no. In 200 year, we never had a typhoon or hurricane. 200 year. Yeah. I know. I read the brochure. Enjoy one more day, okay? Thanks. Sweet. Wait. Where's the luggage? Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Our luggage! Wait! Wait a minute! Hey! Can you stop them?! Um, c-can you call the boat back, please? They have our luggage. They took our luggage. No phone on the boat. Are you kidding me? Don't worry. It will be waiting for you on the other side. Passports are gone. So's your phone. Why don't we take a walk on the beach? Relaxed dress code. Optional, even. It would have to be, because they took most of our luggage. Neil, we have to find our passports. We have to take the 7 p.m. ferry. We can cancel the credit cards. Once we get back to the mainland, we can go to the embassy. I mean, they must handle this sort of thing all the time, right? Okay. Hey, honey, relax. Hey. What's all this? I started thinking. I must have taken some photos last night. All right. Okay. Let's see if we can figure out what happened. This could get ugly. Oh, great. Here's dinner at Hang-sen's. Looking sober. Drinks at Ping-Pong's. Dancing at this place, looking very sexy. See, I remember all of this. Whoa. I was way drunk. You're deleting all of this. Shit, there's a video, 2 1/2 hours long. All right, this is Neil Oliver taking you off the beaten path. We are in a bar, uh, off the coast of Thailand. Drinks. Did you get a good look, Neil? Oh, come on. - Over here! - What are you doing? - We got an 18-hour flight. - ...is intense. - Are you sure? - Oh, absolutely. Shh! The hot waitress is trying to offer us a drink. - Oh! - It's Madee. Hi, Madee! But it's still an 18-hour flight. Then stay. Why leave paradise? Yeah. I mean, why leave paradise? Uh, can you tell me what exactly that is that you're putting in there? Oh. Oh. Oh, good. This is like an out-of-body experience. I don't remember any of this. And one for you, too. - No. I'm okay. I'm okay. - Come on, baby. - Come on, baby. - No, no. Okay. Well... This is SangSom, right? No, seiysla. Call it island magic. Oh, it's so smooth. Thank you. Oh, what's this? - Aww. - Ah. So sweet. A gift. For your brave deeds, may you endure. It will bring you good health. Brave... Brave deeds? Brave enough to do what, exactly? Leave it on you always. For good luck. - Wow, that's... - Guess we figured out where you got the necklace. - I've never seen... - You've never... Excuse me. You stumped the expert. My husband is a travel reporter. He's doing a-a piece on the island. - It's why we're here. - I-I'll do a piece on you. Sweetheart, you all right? No. No. Are you joking? You need help? Sweetheart? Hey! Hey, what did you give us? Hey! Yeah, come on. I got you. Whoa. Neil? Where are we? I have no idea. Neil. What the fuck? What are you doing? Neil... what the fuck?! What the fuck? ...the fuck. Christine, would you wait? Christine, wait! Christine, please open the door. Open the door! Christine, listen to me. We're okay. We were drugged. That's all. Christine, I would never hurt you. Now, will you open this? Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, my God. Open up the door. Christine. Christine, baby, open the door. Christine, I need to know you're all right. Christine! Christine! Christine, unlock the door. Christine! Neil! Christine! Baby! Neil. Hey! Oh, Jesus, you're ice-cold. Honey... I want to go home. Take me home. It's all right. It's all right. Let's get you out of here. Come on. Let's get you out of here. What the hell is this?! Look at the door, Mommy! Nathida, you stay there, okay. We booked this place on Airbnb. You're the Olivers. You were supposed to be checked out by now. - Are you okay? - Yeah, she's fine. She's just... She's feeling a little sick and locked herself in the... the bathroom. - We missed our boat. - Okay. I'd like to hear her say that. I'm okay. It's from Samantha. I called a cab. He's 15 minutes away. Samantha, the room is a mess. It's "Mom," sweetie. She likes to show off. Where did you get this? What did Mommy say about touching other people's things? Only to do it when they're not looking. Oh, you're so smart. Off you go. She needs to see a doctor Yeah, I can... I can take care of her. I think it's best we get out of your hair and go find a hotel. Oh, you are not gonna find a hotel. It's our busy season. We have room. It's fine. Listen, I know the doctor on the island. I can get you in today if you want. Hey. Uh, any English? A little. You are no Thai? No, I'm American. You American. Ahhhh. Ahhhh. Ahh. - Good. - Okay. Doc, listen. We were dosed with something, given a strange drink. She was very sick this morning. She was... She was vomiting dirt. Dirt. I think Nam Mun Prai. Nam Mun Prai. What's... What Nam Mun... Nam Mun Prai. Okay. N-A-M... M-U-N... P-R-A-I. Okay. It's, uh... It's a hard-core Buddhist drink, It's very poisonous, and it's a powerful hallucinogen. You, hallucination. Paranoia, vomiting... basically everything except death. Nope, death as well if you drink too much. You think this was a hallucination? Show him the video. Hollywood. No. No, he... - thinks it's a film. - No. This is a real video, okay? It's real. It's not Hollywood. Real video. Yeah, real video. These bruises are real. I choked her, okay? I can't remember it. I can't remember the last 12 hours. Take. I'm not going to drink this. Everything will be okay. - I'm not drinking this. - No. Bad medicine on our island. Very good food. Turn it off. Turn it off! I-I don't even understand what I'm seeing. Yeah? Well, it looks a lot like you to me. You know that's not me, right? I was throwing up dirt, Neil. Well, you were covered in it. You must have swallowed some of it... And what about these bruises on my neck? They're from you. From me? What's on this video is impossible. We watched you snap my neck! Do you understand how insane that sounds? You're standing here right in front of me, and you're fine. Look, what's on this video, there must be a less crazy explanation for what we're seeing. Right? Neil? Neil?! Neil?! Oh, my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Cafe is like a two-minute walk from here Wait. Wh-Where did you go? Where were you just now? What are you talking about? I just... Christine, are you okay? Come here. - Don't. - What? Look... I understand you're scared, okay? I-I'm scared, too, but don't be scared of me. I would never intentionally hurt you. If you want some space, I can go and try and find the passports. Are you seriously suggesting that we split up right now? - No, I'm just saying... - You know what? Just go take your pictures, Neil, 'cause that's what you wanna do. I'm just trying to do the right thing. I... Only I don't know what that is. I just wanna go home. Seven p.m. tonight, we're getting on that ferry, and we're getting the hell out of here. I'm sorry. I... I don't have any other words. I don't know what happened last night, but whatever it was... I'm sorry. Is this the mystery festival? Yeah, I guess. You're welcome to get closer. Miss, I feel dumb for asking, but what festival is this? Miss? Bon appétit! Did you see the way she looked at this? Yeah. So creepy. I'm done. Go. It's why you came here. It's fine. You're the best. This is Neil Oliver. It's, uh, May 10, a day of no significance on the Thai or Buddhist calendars, but as you can see, the... the islanders are celebrating. Something... Hey! Hey! Hey! God! Hey! What are you doing? God. - Where is my wife? - The bathroom. Christine, honey, we need to leave. Chris... Christine! Christine! Christine! Christine! Christine! Hey. Have you seen her? Hey. Have you seen her? Mr. Oliver! We found your wife! Christine! Christine? Christine, sweetheart. Say something. - Her arm! - I got you. Got you. Yeah, I can see her fuckin' arm. Ah, it's okay. What the fuck happened to her, huh? Sorry. Sorry. Hurts. Aw, what happened? Huh? Come on, sweetie. I-I must have looked around the entire town looking for you. Where'd you go, huh? God. Did you put this back on me? What? No. I left it on the table at the cafe. Why won't you tell me what happened? You won't believe me. What are you talking about? After today, try me. Let's go get this bandaged properly, okay? When I got my vision back, I looked up at them, and they were completely faceless. Their eyes were sewn shut. Their mouths were sewn shut. I sound totally crazy. No. No, look... I believe you. Check this out. It looks just like you. - Kind of. - Yeah. - Wait. She gave me the necklace. - Christine... Hey! Hey! Excuse me. There was a woman who just left here. Can you tell us something about her? Chakrii... My son. Needs a doctor, don't you think? No, just rest. What do you know about this necklace? Anything? Hey, hey, easy. Easy. Okay. Thank you. What the fuck was that? It's an honor on our island, special gift for celebrated guest. A celebrated guest? I'm a tourist, all right? Do you know Madee? The woman who just left here, she gave this to me. You want to thank her? Yes. I want to thank her for the 12 hours that have gone missing since she gave me this necklace. Our passports have been stolen. I was gone again for another hour. My husband looked for me everywhere. He couldn't find me. He didn't know where I was! I've been seeing shit that I don't even know is real! It's all right. Look, we just want to know one thing, okay? Tell us how to find Madee. Madee's bar. I don't recommend you go. It's not for westerners. Yeah, well, it's too late, 'cause I think we've already been. Ms. Christina, Mr. Neil. What surprise. You ran from us. Run from you? We all look alike, right? Come. Come. Neil, that looks like my dress. I try to find you. You went home fast, and you forgot it. Oh, yeah, it must have been really tough to find two foreigners in a town this big, huh? Everybody are foreigners here. I came from somewhere else... as did many. Wait. Wh-Where's the other... Where's... Where's my wife's passport? Only you. What? Listen. After we left here last night, I choked my wife and then buried her in a ditch. Kinky. That's what happen when you ride the manu miti. The what? Dream bird. They say it... it opens up your mind, free your soul. But I wouldn't touch it. Too many side effects. Like hallucination, scramble the brain. So you wouldn't take it, but you serve it? My friend, you're the one who asked for the drink yourself, and I rewarded you... for your bravery. Take your bravery back. No. It's not yours to give. What the hell does that even mean? I am so sick of this cryptic bullshit. What happened last night? And where is my passport? I think we should get out of here. I'll see you around. Hey, one of Samantha's neighbors is a fisherman. He's gonna take us to the mainland now. What? Really? No! You can't go. Isn't the ferry at 7:00? We found another boat that will take us off the island. They have to go back to their own home, sweetie. Why don't you help Neil with the bags, okay? O-Okay. Uh... lead the way. He'll make a great father. Thank you for everything. Oh... And the juice made me feel so much better. Oh, yeah? Island magic, right, just like your necklace. What is that? Is that a real thing? Or is that just superstition? I mean, I used to think so. But I used to be really sick. I went to a specialist in America, Canada, China. Finally someone said I should come to this island. I had no idea what to expect. I mean, I thought I was gonna meet a witch doctor or something, not that I care. I mean, at that point, everything was on the table. But, uh, I got here. I don't know. It was the best thing for me. I haven't been sick since. So whether you call that clean air, climate, or magic, I'll take it. Well, listen. I-I'm not a believer. You clearly are, so... why don't you just take this? I can't, no. It's, uh... It's not meant for me. You should probably just keep it for good luck. Right. Well, look, if you're ever in Boston... Ah, I did 26 years in Minnesota, so if you're lucky enough to find paradise, why try to leave, right? Hey. I was just thinking. No one knows where we are. What are you talking about? Well, we were supposed to be on a flight to the States this afternoon. Let me borrow your phone. Honey? Your phone. Who are you gonna call? My Dad. My sister. The FBI. I don't know. Who did the guy in The Wicker Man call? No one. They burned him to death. Oh, yeah. He didn't have a cell phone, though. I'm gonna try and get reception. I love you. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. This is Neil Oliver taking you off the beaten path. For my travel companion and I, there's no hope of us ever leaving this island. - What the fuck? - Christine, we're about to die horrible deaths. Neil? Neil! Neil! Where's my husband? No, where's my husband? My husband! There was a boat! Where did he go?! Neil! No, he... Where is he? I-I saw him. He... He cut... He cut himself open, and then he... he fell off the end of the dock See this blood? This is... This is his blood. H-He's on the dock. Uh... - Fish. Fish. - No. No! No! How did nobody see this? The tide is out then. There couldn't have been a boat. There was a boat. Oh, God. Hey! You! You saw the boat and the water! You saw me, right, and my husband on the dock? Uh... Christine... ...Neil. He... He said one. He said it was just you, not Neil. He said only one. Wh-What is he trying to do? What is he trying to do? What is... - Just calm down, please. - Oh, God. Witnesses heard you screaming. Wait. Where's his phone? His... His phone? - You camera? - No, his phone. On him. No, I had it. I had it. Somebody took it. Uh, he said, "Did you and Neil fight?" No! No! My husband and I were fine! Oh, my God, what are you doing? What is he doing?! What is this? No, why don't you come on? Come on. Hey, you should drink something. Neil! Neil. Neil! Neil. Christine! Christine, it's Neil... on the phone! Huh? Huh? Neil? Neil? Honey? Neil, speak up, honey. I can't hear you. Hello? Hello? I lost the signal. - What did he say? - I just... The reception was bad. He just said, "Neil," and... Did he say he was okay? I just ran to give you the phone. Oh, this is bullshit. Somebody's messing with us. Do you want to call the police? I know who's doing this. I know where he is. A typhoon warning is in effect... Typhoon Maicala, a major typhoon is poised to make landfall in five hours. Expect pounding rain, flash flooding... What are you and Nathida going to do? ...240 kilometers per hour. A storm hasn't hit the island in 200 years. ...could sweep away anything not nailed down. Just to put this in context for you... ...winds of 130 kilometers an hour. It is shaping up to be the storm of the year, if not the decade, and it's already been classified as a super typhoon. This is the part where I tell you not to go in. This is part where I don't listen. Neil! Neil! Honey? Where is my husband? Mommy. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Easy. Easy. Hey. How did I get here? You don't remember? Whoa! How did I get back here? Uh, as soon as you left the car, you passed out. You collapsed right in front of us. No, that's not possible. You don't remember? I need a minute, please. Yeah, sure. Neil? Christine? What's happening? I don't... Where is it? What? This? I've heard of those things healing the sick, healing worse. You need to see a doctor. If Neil were here... He's not. It was in your head, what you saw. Neil didn't kill himself at the end of my dock. Then what happened? He, uh... He showed me the video. Why would he do that? I... He was freaking out when I found you in the bathroom. He said he didn't know how or why, and he was scared he would do it again. And you're just telling me this now?! If I saw a video of me putting hands on my daughter, I'd wanna get as far away from her as possible. Look, I know you don't trust me. You don't even know me. But whatever is going on with you, you need to see a doctor. I'll do it when I get back to the mainland. You need a doctor from here. Christine. Hmm. You are pregnant. That's not possible. Our island is good for fertility. Pregnant women are sacred here. Neil will be so happy. Congratulations. That's not happening. There's no way. Do you want to see? Oh, my God. That's amazing. Is that the heartbeat? Yeah. Doctor, this hallucination? Nam Mun Prai? No. No Nam Mun Prai. They said it wasn't possible. What was that? He wants you to relax. He's worried about you. Oh, no. Don't you dare. Don't you dare! Wait! Christine, wait! It's ok... What is this? What's happening? Storm. You need to leave. I haven't found Neil yet. My... My husband. No husband. Ride? Boat? I... No, I don't want a ride or... or a boat. I need to find my husband, and then I'll get a ride. Can I borrow your... your phone? Your cell phone? No service. Of course. Hello? Hello? Kanda? I'm pregnant. Stop. You already know that. There was a time when everybody didn't have a phone in their pocket. You were never meant to see what happened. You would have remained unaware. I am brutally aware that my husband forced himself on me and then strangled me. Forced? No, encouraged... to create a new life. Being pregnant, there is no stronger spirit in our faith. No, no, stop. I was dead, okay? I saw the video. How am I standing here? Not quite dead. Not quite living. That necklace keeps the scales from tipping in the wrong direction. Right now, you exist on the spiritual plane, where the spirits can prepare you for the final ritual. I know this sounds... Fucking insane? Yeah. For hundreds of years, they have been burying pregnant women under the post of the town square. They believe that these sacrifices get them what they want, to keep the island safe. and tonight, they sacrifice you to stop the storm. Oh, fuck that. I can't even believe this conversation we're having right now. Are you kidding me? The man that I've loved since I was 19, he conspired to kill me by order of these crazy people. It wasn't him. Nam Mun Prai... corpse oil. It can control your mind. They gave it to Neil, and he buried you in our soil. My son, he doesn't have much time left, days, maybe weeks. I don't believe in their rituals. I don't believe an unwilling sacrifice can stop the storm, but I do believe in that. It has the power to heal. I can help you if you help my son. Just give me the necklace... No, not until you help me find my husband and get us off this fucking island. Then you can have whatever you want. Ahh! No, no, no. You need a doctor. My... My son. Sorry. Okay. Kanda? Oh, no. Oh, no. Run! Oh, God. Oh, God. Run. Hello? Is anybody... I need help. Shit. Excuse me. Can you help me? Can you help me? Can you help? Excuse me. I need... Excuse me! I need a phone. Can you help me? No, no, no. Christine, oh, my God. I've been looking everywhere for you. She's dead. Who? - Kanda. - God. Come on. Let's get you out of here. Are you taking me to the ferry? Yeah. Come on. Why are you dressed like them? What, this? This is for the festival. Come on. I just parked over here. Let's go. Right now, the typhoon is only 1 1/2 hours away, so if you are still within the path of the typhoon, then you need to evacuate or get yourself to somewhere safe immediately. If your power goes out, remain calm. Mom, this isn't the way to the ferry. It's a shortcut. This is against the rules. Nathida. Sorry. She plays these games. Sweetie, Mama needs to concentrate, okay? She wants to go to the ferry. You have to take her. Stop the car. I'm taking you to the ferry. Stop lying. Mommy... she knows. I'm not a bad person. What happened to my husband? You saw Kanda's son. That's what happens when you only believe when it's convenient. This, this is the real deal. The real deal? Ritual sacrifice? Kanda used to believe, and her son was fine. You're bat-shit fucking crazy. You know that? - I love my daughter! - Your daughter? Back there was the first time you ever saw an ultrasound. She's not very good at this. Shut up, Nathida! Where's your Mom? Stop lying. Where is your Mom? Down below. She loved this island. It was a sacrifice she was happy to make. It's an honor. You killed her mother? I didn't do anything. She volunteered. She loved this island and her little girl. I said I was sick when I came here. Stage-three pancreatic cancer. But here, there's no such thing as cancer, heart attacks, stroke, not for those who believe. That life growing inside of you when it wasn't possible everywhere else... Yeah. A gift this island gave you. This is some bastardized fanatical backwash that you soulless motherfuckers came up with to... to feel like you have some kind of control, that you have a say in any of this! Where the fuck is my husband?! Your husband is dead, Christine. He killed himself right in front of your eyes. That is this island, and its people believe in something far greater than you or your fucking... Ms. Christine. What are we doing here? Will you just let me go? For generation, it was a great honor, Ms. Christine, to be marked as celebrated. And tonight we celebrate you. We thank you for your gift... for our island. And at all times, people volunteer for this honor. You should be proud. Volunteer? I didn't volunteer for this. Fuck you! The drink, you asked for. The necklace, you accept. No. We had some shots, and you put some stupid trinket around my neck. You did that. You had free will, Ms. Christine. You could have left, but you chose to stay, find your husband. There were boats, Ms. Christine. I believe he offered you one. Because free will is so essential. Of course, something, free will is an illusion. You saw Neil died, but you chose not to leave. No. Did you just not run right to us right here at our old city pillar? Don't fucking touch me. I'm not pregnant, you motherfucker! Pregnant, you very much are. She is one part from your husband and one part from this island. No, what did you put inside me? Island magic. I never had free will. If I have free will, untie me. You don't have to believe it... but we do. We will honor our gods. What are we doing here? It's a girl. You're going to be a great Dad. She's gonna do amazing things. Both of you are gonna do amazing things. But I need you to wake up. I wanna stay here. Wake up! Stop! It has to be her choice! Stay back! Stay the fuck back. You, where's your boat? You! If you go, I'll die. They'll all die. It's not real, Nathida. It's just a storm. - It is real! - No! Come with me. Save us, Christine. Reports are coming in from Thailand that super typhoon Maicala has bypassed the majority of the islands, with the exception of the tiny island of Little Ko Kut. Ko Kut hasn't seen a storm of this magnitude in over 200 years, so long, in fact, that they advertise this to tourists. All right, copy that.
