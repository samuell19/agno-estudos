Sounds good. l was a little worried there for a second. Oh, it's, uh, it's a musical journey. That's really what it is. What the movie is... is about is when a band is developing, it goes through certain stages, and for us, like, we're not the same band we were when we recorded the War album, for instance. And we captured that on Under a Blood Red Sky, and we just wanted to capture this period of... of the band to... Ah, fuck it. l don't know. That's Larry doing the... What's the film about? lt's a musical journey. lt's about music... l hope. At least, that's what you said it was going to be about. You know he got the cure You know he went astray He used to stay awake To drive the dreams he had away He wanted to believe ln the hands of love The hands of love Oh! Oh! His head, it felt heavy As he cut across the land A dog started crying Like a brokenhearted man ln the howling wind ln the howling wind He went deeper into black Deeper into white He sees the stars shine like nails in the night He felt the healing, healing Healing hands of love Like the stars shining from above His hand in his pocket His finger on the steel The pistol weighed heavy His heart he could feel Was beating, beating, beating, beating Oh, my love, my love, my love, my love They say the hands that build... They say the hands that build... can also pull down. Even the hands of love. Even the hands of love!

Well, we wrote the song l Still Haven't Found What l'm Looking For, which is a gospel song pretty much. lt doesn't sound much like a gospel song the way we do it, but if you look at the lyric and the basic music, that's exactly what it is. We got a cassette from a friend of ours at lsland Records of a gospel choir covering the song, and it sounded like-- lt sounded totally different, but it sounded really exciting and new. So we traveled down to Harlem and visited this church in the middle of Harlem where this choir were going through a rehearsal, and we played with them and got the idea to do a kind of combination arrangement. My own conga. My very own conga. l have climbed The highest mountain l have run Through the fields Only to be with you Only to be with you l have run l have crawled l have scaled These city walls These city walls Only to be with you But l still Haven't found What l'm looking for But l still Haven't found What l'm looking for l have kissed Honey lips Felt the healing ln her fingertips You're burning like a fire Burning hot as fire This burning desire Burning with desire l have spoke With the tongue of angel l have held The hand of the devil lt was warm in the night ln the night l was cold as a stone Cold as stone But l still Haven't found What l'm looking for But l still Haven't found What l'm looking for All right.

Silver and Gold. This song was written in a hotel room in New York City... round about the time a friend of ours, Little Steven, was putting together a record of artists against apartheid. lt's a song written about a man... in a shantytown outside of Johannesburg... A man who's sick of looking down the barrel of white South Africa, a man who is at the point where he is ready to take up arms against his oppressor... A man who has lost faith in the peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man like Bishop Tutu... and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa. Am l bugging you? l don't mean to bug you. O.K., Edge, play the blues. Have you already started writing for this next album, and being so influenced by American music, will it incorporate some American music? We went to Sun Studios in Memphis. Even though it's been a barbershop and even though it's been a few other things, like a store, the exact same studio exists and even the same tiles. And we got Cowboy Jack Clement down. He recorded Jerry Lee Lewis' Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On. And we recorded five new songs in five hours. Angel Of Harlem. Larry Mullen, Jr. l don't have a mike on. You don't know what l'm saying. lf l had those feet, l wouldn't want them in the film. lf l had a head like yours, l'd bleedin' bury it. lt was a cold and wet December day When we touched the ground at JFK lt was sunset over Uncle Sam Charlie and the birdman And Angel New York like a Christmas tree At night, this city belongs to me Angel Soul love This love won't let me go Oh, oh, oh So long Angel of Harlem Blue light on the avenue God knows when they got to you Strung out, you learn to sing Your eyes swollen like a bee sting Birdland on 53 The streets sound like a symphony We got John Coltrane and the Love Supreme Miles, and she's got to be An angel Soul love Well, this love won't let me go So long Angel of Harlem Mmm, hmm, hmm Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Yeah, yeah Well, when you're on the road for that long, sometimes you just feel like doing something that isn't on the schedule and just shaking it up a bit. lt's just, like, music can get so boring, so conservative, so predictable. We've got a flatbed truck set up in front of the plaza with your gear. Whenever you're ready, we can go. We're ready right now. We've got to work out All Along the Watchtower. Who do we know that knows the words to All Along the Watchtower? There must be some way out of here What's going on? We could try it in C. There must be some way out of here B, C, A-flat-- A-sharp, rather. O.K. "There must be some way out of here" Said the joker to the thief "There is too much confusion here" "l can't get no relief" l think that's close. ls that O.K.? Are we going? Let's go. "There must be some way out of here" Said the joker to the thief "There is too much confusion here" "l can't get no relief" "Businessmen, they drink my wine" "Plowmen dig my earth" "None of them know along the line" "What any of this is worth, yeah" "No reason to get excited" The thief, he kindly spoke "There are many among us, yeah" "Who think that life is but a joke" "But you and l, we've been through that" "And that is not our fate" "So let us not talk falsely now" "Because the hour is getting late" Hey, hey, hey Uh, uh, uh All along the watchtower Princes kept the view While her husband came and went Barefoot servants, too Yeah.

Desert sky Dream beneath the desert sky The rivers run, but soon run dry We need new dreams tonight Desert rose Dreamed l saw a desert rose Her dress torn in ribbons and in bows Like a siren, she calls to me Sleep comes like a drug ln God's country Sad eyes, crooked crosses ln God's country, yeah Yeah Naked flame She stands, a naked flame l stand with the sons of Cain Burned by the fire of love Burned by the fire of love Whoa, oh, oh, Whoa, oh, oh Whoa, oh, oh, whoa Thank you. Thank you very much. That was good. Really smashing the cymbals there, huh? You want to change this? Pass me a tissue please, Fintan. Thank you. Right, with the B.B. King song, watch for the third verse. Not the first verse, the first chorus, not the second verse-- But the third verse. But the third verse, which comes after the chorus. l start to count. Then you come in. Keep looking at me. Stand beside me. We should all look at Larry? Just be in the right. Make sure because when we get on there, so we're all prepared, just stand beside me-- boom, and in-- because Edge is on a completely different timing, as usual. Let me introduce to you-- l'd like to introduce to you somebody whose music we've just come to know and love over the last year or so and his incredible band. This is B.B. King and B.B. King's band here. Where's B.B.? Believe it or not, B.B. King came to Dublin, lreland. He was playing in this club in Dublin, lreland, and we wrote this song for him. lt's called When Love Comes To Town. l went to listen to the tape. l was able to kind of get some of it together. l hope you liked the song. l love the song. l think that the lyric is really... Real heavy lyrics. You're mighty young to write such heavy lyrics. Ha ha ha! You know, l'm one of those rebel-like guys. l like to get in there and see what's going on. Break the mold a little. That's right. Yeah. They kind of... look at me kind of weird. They say, "Here he is, a 62-year-old, and look what he's trying to do." You're 62? Yeah, l'm 62. l'm no good with chords, so what we do is... get somebody else to play chords, and-- Well, Edge will do that. There's not much chords in this song. l think there's only two. l'm horrible with chords. l don't know what to do there. l'm just-- l'm just-- Go ahead. yeah. Was that a joke? Ha ha! l was a sailor, l was lost at sea l was under the waves before love rescued me l was a fighter, l could turn on a thread But l stand accused of the things l've said When love comes to town l'm gonna jump that train When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame Baby, l was wrong To ever let you down But l did what l did Before love came to town l used to make love under the red sunset l was making promises l was soon to forget "Pale as the lace on her wedding gown." Are you scared? "l left her standing before love came to town." Ran into a juke joint When l heard a guitar scream The notes were turning blue And l fell into a dream As the music played l saw my life turn around But that was the day before love came to town When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that train When love comes to town l'm gonna catch that flame Baby, l was wrong To ever let you down But l did what l did Before love came to town Hey, yeah, yeah Hey, yeah, yeah "l held the scabbard when the soldier drew the sword. l threw the dice when they pierced his side, but l've seen love conquer the great divide." When love comes to town, l'm gonna jump that train When love comes to town, l'm gonna catch that flame Baby, l was wrong to ever let you down But l did what l did Before love came to town Thank you. Good night! Ha ha ha! All right. Might as well go for it. Lot of emotion right there. That's all right, young man. That's all right. See the sun rise over her skin Don't change it Woo! See the sun rise over her... Yo! Thumb a lift there, Edge. Dawn changes everything Everything And the Delta sun Burns bright and violent Mississippi and the cotton wool heat 66, a highway speaks Of deserts dry Of cool green valleys Gold and silver mines... l was a little bit disturbed about going to Graceland, to be honest, because unlike what some of the other guys are saying, l loved the Elvis movies. l used to watch them because it was great to see a film star who was a musician. ln every single one of his movies, he wasn't acting as a car salesman. He was acting as a car salesman who loved to play guitar. l really related to that because l worked myself for a couple of years. l was a glorified messenger boy, but l loved to play the drums. l related to that. l loved the Elvis movies. Over her skin She feels like water in my hand Freeway like a river cuts through this land lnto the side of love like a burning spear And the poison rain brings a flood of fear Through the ghost ranch here Can we get a photograph on the bike? Um, well, we can--ha ha! How about the snowmobile? The snowmobile. Well, this man-- What Harley-Davidson means to this man, you would not know. How about-- How about off-camera? That would be fine. Just like a personal photograph. We'll keep this away. O.K., you can do that. ln this heartland Heaven knows, this is the heartland Heart, heartland, Hey, yeah Heaven knows, this is the heartland Heartland Heartland l was worried that our involvement, that us going to Graceland would take away from him and take away from us. When l got there, l enjoyed it and all that, but seeing the graves and, like, the eternal flame and all that just seemed-- it seemed very distant. l wish he hadn't been buried in there-- in the, uh, back garden. l really wish that he'd been buried somewhere where l couldn't have gone. l would have felt better. l don't know why. lt's just one of those things, you know. lf you twist and turn away lf you tear yourself in two again lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go Surrender Dislocate lf l could throw this lifeless lifeline To the wind Leave this heart of clay See you walk, walk away lnto the night Through the day lf l could, through myself Set your spirit free l'd lead your heart away See you break, break away lnto the light Through the day lnto the half-light Through the flame Singing Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh So let it go, uh-huh And so fade away So let it go, uh-huh And so fade away Wide-awake l'm wide-awake Wide-awake l'm not sleeping Oh, no l'm not sleeping lf they should ask Well, maybe they'd tell me what l should say True colors fly in blue and black Through silken sky and burnin' flag Colors crash, collide in bloodshot eyes lf l could, you know l would lf l could, l would let it go This desperation Separation Condemnation ln temptation lsolation, revelation lsolation, revelation Let it go, uh-huh And so fade away Let it go, uh-huh And so fade Fade Fade away Not fade away No, no Not fade away No, no Not fade away Hey, hey Let it go, uh-huh And so fade away So let it go, uh-huh And so fade Fade Fade away Fade away Not fade away No, no Not fade away Hey, hey, ooh Wide-awake l'm wide-awake Wide-awake l'm not sleeping Oh, no l'm not sleeping Oh, no Good-bye, Ruby Tuesday Who could hang a name on you?

Whoo Bullet the blue sky Bullet the blue sky Bullet the blue Bullet the blue ln the locust wind Comes a rattle and hum Jacob wrestled the angel And the angel was overcome You plant a demon seed You raise a flower of fire See them burning crosses See the flames, higher and higher Sky Whoo Sky...

So this guy comes up to me His face red, like a rose on a thorn bush Like all the colors of a royal flush And he's peeling off those dollar bills Slapping 'em down 100! 200! And l can see those fighter planes l can see those fighter planes Across the mud huts where the children sleep Through the valleys and the quiet city streets We take the staircase to the first floor We turn the key and slowly unlock the door A man breathes into his saxophone And through the walls, we hear the city groan Outside, it's America Outside, it's America So back in the hotel room With John Coltrane and the Love Supreme ln the next room, l hear some woman scream out That her lover is turning off Turning on the television Well, l can't tell the difference Between ABC News, Hill Street Blues And the preacher of the Old Time Gospel Hour Stealing money from the sick and the old Well, the god l believe in lsn't short of cash, mister l feel a long way From the hills of San Salvador Where the sky is ripped open And the rain pours through a gaping wound Pelting the women and children Pelting the women and children Who run...who run... lnto the arms... Of America And so she woke up She woke up from where she was lying still Said l--l gotta do something About where l'm going Step on a steam train Step out of the driving rain Maybe run from the darkness in the night Singing ha, ha la la la de day Ha la la la de day Ha la la de day Mmm Sweet the sin But bitter the taste in my mouth l see seven towers But l only see one way out You got to cry without weeping Talk without speaking Scream without raising your voice You know, l took the poison From the poison stream Then l floated out of here Singing ha, ha la la la de day Ha la la la de day Ha la la de day Oh...ooh Ooh, oh She runs through the streets With her eyes painted red Under black belly of cloud in the rain ln through a doorway she brings me White gold and pearls stolen from the sea She is raging, she is raging And the storm blows up in her eyes She will suffer the needle chill She's running to stand... Still l'm still running Still running Still running, yeah l'm still running Still running Still running Still running Still running Still running l'm still running Still running l don't-- l'm not even sure that that song should be in the film-- Sunday Bloody Sunday-- because l-- you know, that day, the day of the Enniskillen, uh...bombing, you know, will soon long since be forgotten, and people will not understand the way we felt onstage. Well, here we are, the lrish in America. The lrish have been coming to America for years... going back to the great famine when the lrish were on the run from starvation... and the British government that couldn't care less... right up to today. You know, there are more lrish immigrants here in America today than ever-- some illegal, some legal. A lot of them are just running from high unemployment. Some run from the troubles in Northern lreland, from the hatred of the H-blocks, the torture-- others from wild acts of terrorism like we had today in a town called Enniskillen, where 11 people lie dead, many more injured, on a Sunday, bloody Sunday. Ooh, oh, oh Ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh l can't believe the news today l can't close my eyes and make it go away How long, how long must we sing this song? How long, how long? Tonight We can be as one Tonight Broken bottles under children's feet Bodies strewn across a dead-end street But l won't heed the battle call That puts my back up, my back up against the wall Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday And this battle's yet begun There's many lost, but tell me, who has won? Trenches dug within our hearts Mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday How long, how long must we sing this song? How long, how long? Tonight We can be as one Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight Tonight Oh! Yeah Yeah And let me tell you something. l've had enough of lrish-Americans who haven't been back to their country in 20 or 30 years come up to me and talk about the resistance, the revolution back home... and the glory of the revolution and the glory of dying for the revolution. Fuck the revolution! They don't talk about the glory of killing for the revolution. What's the glory... in taking a man from his bed and gunning him down in front of his wife and his children? Where's the glory in that? Where's the glory in bombing a remembrance day parade of old-age pensioners, their medals taken out and polished up for the day? Where's the glory in that? To leave them dying or crippled for life or dead under the rubble... of a revolution... that the majority of the people in my country don't want? No more! Sing! No more No more No more No more No more No more No more No more No more Wipe your tears away Wipe your tears away Wipe your bloodshot eyes Wipe your tears away Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday Once again. Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday And it's true we are immune When fact is fiction, TV a reality And today the millions die We eat and drink while tomorrow they die - Sunday bloody Sunday - The real battle's just begun - Sunday bloody Sunday - To claim the victory Jesus won Yeah Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday Sunday bloody Sunday One man come in the name of love One man come and go One man come, he to justify One man to overthrow ln the name of love What more in the name of love? ln the name of love What more in the name of love?
