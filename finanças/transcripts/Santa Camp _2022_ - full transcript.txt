[laughter] Dick, you've been doing this probably longer than any of us. I mean, you must have some stories about... Oh, sure. [hoarsely] This little boy was waiting... [clears throat] In line. And he was just jumping, and he held his hands, and he was smiling like crazy, you know? And, like, he just could not wait to get to see Santa. And so, finally, it's his turn. And I says, "And so how are you?" And he says, "I pooped!" [laughter] So I've got one. A lot of times they'll say, "All right, if you're the real Santa, what's my name?" Oh, I got that one. And usually what I say is, "Listen, I only know "the names of the children on the nice list. I don't know your name." [laughter] So I got a call to book a Santa. And she said, "Is he white?" And I was like, "Well, yeah, I mean all the Santas I have are white." So I'm thinking about trying to bring on people who can... So you can offer Santas who aren't kind of the cookie cutter, white, 65 years old, fat. Now, some clients will disagree because they have a very specific thing they want in their Santa. The way I explained it one time when I got challenged on it was, well, I started with the history of Santa, okay? Santa originated in the European continent, and the predominant population was white. So Santa would be white. - Actually... - That's wrong. Jesus Christ and St. Nicholas would have been brown, not white. I'm talking about trying to explain to a four-year-old child why she can't have a Black Santa. It doesn't matter. It just doesn't matter whether they're gay, they're white, they're Jewish, they're Black. Being the oldest member of this group, for my generation, at first, this was a little difficult to accept. But God created no junk. You know? So it doesn't matter. [light music] [engine turning over] ♪ ♪ Oh, about ten years ago, we created the New England Santa Society. And it's open for Santas of all types, Mrs. Clauses, elves, and other holiday performers. We have a lot of really experienced Santas. I mean, we have Santas who have been doing it 30, 40, 50 years. So we created a school, which is now called Santa Camp. It's starting to become more visible and we're starting to do much more promotion of it. So this is one of the most popular top reasons to come to Santa Camp. We have some photos. We have some videos. We do have our kazoo band. [kazoos playing] One of the things I think really sets our Santa school apart is that we have been trying to reach out to more and more types of Santas and Santas from different backgrounds, just people who are different. But I think sometimes the issue we run into is that people just have a very specific idea of what Santa should look like. And I think a lot of times, it's their childhood Santa, the one they remember as kids. ♪ ♪ Does Santa need to have a look? Well, he's certainly got to look something like Santa Claus. It must be a red suit, black belt, beard. And it's much better if they can pull it, okay? You can get, like, a heat iron, and you just kind of curl it and roll it under. The belly can be padded. Mine is real. I can't hide that. I think people definitely have an expectation of how Santa should look. A few years ago, I understand that they did hire a Black Santa at the Mall of America. And apparently it didn't go so well, and there was a lot of pushback about it, and not everybody was thrilled with the idea. A Black Santa Claus at the Mall of America, the country's largest mall, is causing a torrent of hateful, racist comments. With some people online even calling for a boycott. There was some talk on the Internet, not from other Santas. Unfortunately, in America, we're not quite at the stage where everybody can be accepted as Santa Claus. I just don't know why it's necessary. I don't understand why people feel they need a Black Santa Claus. Changing the race is cultural appropriation. For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white. How do you just revise it, you know, in the middle of the legacy of the story and change Santa from white to Black? I mean, you can't.

Have you always seen Santa as being white? Yes. I wish there was, like, a variety of Santas that are willing to come in different colors to let people know that they could come in any different shape and form, you know?

He claims that he was the target of a racist note... Attacking him for not having a white Santa. I have never had any problems out of anybody. All of a sudden, we got a problem with Black Santa. But this man he ain't coming down. [dramatic music] We moved to North Little Rock specifically for our daughter. We wanted to offer her a great education from the very beginning. I'm drawing Santa. No, I'm gonna do a little bit of brown. He's kind of chocolaty. But, you know, we're Black people in a predominantly white neighborhood. - That is the Karen right there. - Yes. - She making blocks. - Yeah, she is. - And she's calling. - Calling who? - The police, I guess. - Psycho.

You learn techniques. And you learn the business 'cause the business of Santa Claus is very big. I could easily walk away with $2,000 a night. There's a particular Santa that comes from Rhode Island. He's known as Santa to the Stars. I mean, he has a house in Italy. I mean, he has a house in California, and he drives brand-new cars. I think there's approximately 5,000 to 6,000 professional Santas. And you know the whole reason of having professional Santas is to improve, like a guild.

He was very supportive of the move now to try to expand the diversity of the Santa community and trying to brainstorm, like, how do we reach out, how do we find those people? Well, you can't put an ad in the paper, say, "Any dwarfs out there that want to be Santa Claus, "particularly if you're Jewish and of a different color." There's no way for us to ask for that that I'm aware of without offending. There is that conservatism sometimes in the Santa community that's very closed.

When somebody sees a Black Santa, they're like, "Mm, oh, jeez, that's not what we were raised with."

So he really wasn't white. He was olive, would you say? Santa's an icon. Coke was a big promoter of what Santa looked like, to the point where you have customers who come along and say, "I want Santa." And they know exactly what they want. They want the Coke Santa. Over all the years I've done this, I have never been asked by a child, "How come you're white? How come Santa isn't Black like me?" So kids don't see color. Do you find that the challenge of being a Santa, when most of us look like this, is tough, or do you think it's gonna become more and more accepted? I don't think it'll be as tough as most would think because there is a request, a need out there. For us, the closest Santa would have been New Orleans or Houston. - Yeah. - Five to nine hours away. - So I'm gonna be my own. - [chuckles] Are you looking to be Santa elsewhere? - Yes. - In other words... - Okay. - Yes. It's... that's yeah. So... yeah. I don't necessarily think that other Santas were asked those kind of questions. There are definitely a few Santas that are uncomfortable with a Santa of color or, in general, with me being here. But it's not a new experience to me because I've gone through it all my life. It's not a ball, teddy bear. [dog whimpering] Santa, of course, is the limelight, but Mrs. Claus has been coming up into that limelight quite a bit in the last, I don't know, eight to ten years. I needed an outlet for the seriousness of nursing. And now we're here. So you just never know. I think that the Mrs. Santas tend to be overlooked a lot. Sometimes you feel like, "Ah, nobody cares." Santa and Mrs. Claus don't always get along. No, because they're two different people, sometimes with two different opinions about things. Most of the time they better, though. [indistinct chatter] Any of you who are Mrs. Clauses it is a chore trying to make sure they're all dressed and they look good and they're presentable and they have their white gloves and they're all clean. That's interesting. After all these years, I wondered how my stuff all got put together. [laughter] Just a comment on that. It's good for the kids to see that they're married, that they're married like their parents are married, that it's not that much different, except that he's Santa Claus and that's Mrs. Claus. [exhales deeply] Santa is often considered the lead performer, and Mrs. Claus is the support character. How do each of you balance your performances to share that spotlight? I have heard Santas ask for the pricing schedule, and it'd be $100 for me and Mrs. Claus. And they said, "Well, you know, that's a little steep. How about if Mrs. Claus doesn't come?"
