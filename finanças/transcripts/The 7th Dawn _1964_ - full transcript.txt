Attention all gerilla forces! Attention all gerilla forces! The war is over. The war is over. All Japanese forces had unconditionally surrendered. The enemy you've been fighting, had been conquered. All courts other than Official British Military Court... are declared to be without authority. Attention all gerilla forces! Attention all gerilla forces! The war is over. The war is over. All Japanese forces had unconditionally surrendered. All Japanese forces had unconditionally surrendered. The enemy you've been fighting, had been conquered. All courts other than Official British Military Court... are declared to be without authority. Attention all gerilla forces! Attention all gerilla forces! The war is over. Sounds like it's all over. My hearing is not so good. Mine is. With his luck, I'd like to back him in a crap game. It's over! - Dhana. - It's over! You think they won the war on their own. Now, they helped a bit. I'm afraid they may not always be so cooperative. Look at those limeys. They always love a parade. That must be Ferris. Can't be anyone else. Ferris, sir? You know him? Major Ferris. American engineer with the 8th Australia. After we lost Singapore he was in one of the stay-behind parties. You're Ferris? Major Ferris? I'm Ferris. My name is Trumpey. This is Captain Williams. You have to excuse the way I look, my valet is on vacation. I think you're excellently dressed for the occasion. Admiral Mountbatten is delegated me to take the Japanese swords today. Little late, aren't you? Late? Yeah, about five years. That's the longest tea break in history. I see you may be back in time to take the bows. You sound a bit critical, Major Ferris. I am. There're people on this field with more right to take the Japanese swords. Colonel Ng for instance. He'd been taking the sharp ends of them while you... limeys had been sitting on your backsides in Whitehall. Well, some of us spent a bit of our time on our feet in Burma, Major. However as unworthy as it may seem, permit me to congratulate you on the job you did in the jungle. Well, you have to give them the name for manners, Ferris. That's their secret weapon. Now that's all over, what are your plans? First, I'm going to take a bath which will last for two weeks. Then when I return to the Human Family, I'll get myself a job teaching school. Major Ferris, do you think we can stand all that? I'm adaptable. Parade! Attention! If you please, Colonel Osaki, you'll surrender your sword to Colonel Ng. Over there. Hey! Oh, Ng! Sorry, chum, we almost missed you. You can congratulate me. What's happened? I'm a landlord. I've just bought a stretch of land across the bay, about 2000 acres, just oozing with rubber. 'Course I bought it on the never-never. But that's only the beginning. Before I'm through, I'm going to own half of Malaya. Only half? - Why not all of it? - The other half is for you! Keep it all. Oh, come on, you talk like a shell shut case. Now, it won't cost you a cent. Thank you, Ferris. I have other plans. - Then shelve them. - No, Ferris. Listen, we've been such a good team. Don't leave us now. Yeah, you can't do that. Anyway, I owe you a lot. You owe me nothing. Well, only my life. You saved that often on. You did the same for me. We're even. Your other plans are that important, huh? Very important. Anyway I can help? Sometime, maybe. First, I have to go to finish my education in Moscow. We've been friends, Ferris. But loyalty shifts. One day our friendship may not be possible. There's something you don't seem to understand, Ng. The one thing that makes sense to me out this whole, stupid world is... loyalty to a guy who gives you a hand. If this Moscow bit is so important to you, okay. Never make any difference the way I feel about you. In that case, we can always remain friends. From the bottom of my heart I wish you all the luck in the world, Ng. I have a question to ask you, Dhana. Why don't you come with me? If you did, I would like the honour of making you my wife. You know the way I feel about you, Ng. But I have other plans. Thank you for asking me. It's time to go. - I will never forget either of you. - Write us occasionally, chum. Will you accept a token from me? This amulet is my only heritage from my father. It is very powerful. It was kept the bullets away from me. Let's hope it's equally good for attracting dollars. Thanks, I'll always keep it with me. And that includes all the way from South ridge, right? Yes, Mr. Ferris. Nine feet wide light asphalt. Make it twice that wide. It'll be a lot of traffic on that road. Hello, Tarlton. Building your new road, I see. And the build a big hydroelectric plant, they tell me. That's the plan. Anything I can do for you? Oh, you own practically everything around here. How would you like to own my place too? Name your own price. Might be interested. You sure you know what you're doing? The war ended eight years ago for the rest of the world but not for me. I can't take it any longer. I'm getting out. Ah, don't be foolish. This trouble can't last forever. Either the british win and the terrorists will pull out. Or the terrorists win and the british will pull out. In any case, people will still buy rubber. No, I've had it. I'm packing up. Last night they have destroyed my best field. If it's a loan you need... No, I don't want charity. I never want to see this country again. Apparently the only chaps like you can survive here. It didn't sound very complimentary. I've only meant that this is a country for bachelors now. I'm a family man. Any day now the terrorists will drop a grenade on me... and my kids will be orphans. You know how many planters had been ambushed in the last year? I don't mind admitting that terror campaign succeeded with me. I'm terrified, alright. I give you 250 thousand dollars for it. Alright, it's a deal. I'll drop the papers tomorrow. You can drop around my place till wednesday. Oh, thanks, Ferris. I'm sure. It's a story. I'm getting out with 250 thousand dollars. Apparently we have visitors, Lim. Yes. The chief police officer and several gentleman are waiting in the sitting room. - Evening, gentleman. - Hello, Ferris. Have your drinks? Yes, thank you. Hello, Tom. Nice to see you, Ferris. Interesting place you got here, Ferris. That's a mighty looking brute. You love killing, haven't you? Some people refer to as shooting. One and the same thing, isn't it? All ends up with something dead. Never could see it myself. There was a bit of shooting down the road today. Another ambush. Tarlton. Tarlton? I just saw him in this morning. Then you must've been the last to see him alive. What about his wife? She'd been told. Brings the casualty total to past six month to 205. This terror campaign doesn't make any sort of sense, Ferris. The terrorists say they want independence. Britains's out for the same thing. Evidently the terrorists have some doubt about that. Well, somehow we just got to convince them. We're always sending out a new man with the instructions that hurry things up. What we need is someone who could make the terrorists understand... that Britain's sincere. We'd like you to have a try. Why me? Oh, come on now, Ferris. Don't take that line with us. Everyone knows how cosy you are with your yellow friend. I don't choose my friends according to their colour. I even have a few white friends. That's a stupid remark, Ferris. That's my hobby, Cavendish. Stupidity. Especially when I'm talking to a uniform. Gentlemen, please. Take a look at that. Do you know him? Yes, I know Ng. Well, he's now back in Malaya and command the entire terrorist campaign, actually directing it himself. He's oredring the ambushes, the shootings, the lot. I don't think we're telling Ferris anything he doesn't know already. Are you and Ng old friends? Obviously he has confidence in you. I have no belly for politics, Tom. I wouldn't know where to look for him. Doesn't it strike you as strange, Ferris, that every rubber planter of a miles around, that had some form of terrorist activity aim against him. But your estates, your tin mines, your houses have all been safe and sound. Anything else? Now, if you've doubt about pulling it off alone, why not take your girl, Dhana along to see Ng. After all as president of the Teachers Union... she's counting contact with many of Ng's admirers. I think your suggestion stinks, Cavendish. Come off it, Ferris. We know all about your friend Ng and Dhana. Dhana Mercier, born in Saigon, father: french sergeant, mother: eurasian. Family raised Ng from the age of nine. Well? I'm wondering where'd put your head on the wall. We'd like you to think it over, Ferris, and let us know your decision. Frankly, we need you. That's the long and the short of it. Right, gentlemen. Well, that's about it. Thanks for the drink. - Goodbye, Ferris. - Goodbye, Ferris. You heard them? Thanks for the character preference. You seem really upset. They have photographs of Ng. A russian's honoured them by publishing. I haven't heard from him lately. Have you? No, not a word. But it's just like Ng. I think I'll drop in on him. He'd only be in one of three places in the jungle. Take some doing to find him. Will you stand it without me for a couple of weeks? I'm an old soldier, used to hardships. Slow down. You got a long and hard trip in front of you. We didn't use to feel in that way in the jungle. We never used words in the jungle. Hold your fire, I'm Ferris! I want to see Colonel Ng. Do you understand? Well, you silly basket, don't you recognize me? Ferris! Ferris! - How are you, chum? - Fine, thank you. But... How did you find me? You clod, who do you think discover this valley in the first place? But how did you know I'll be here? Well, you never could find anything for yourself in this jungle anyhow. So I knew darn well you use this hideout. Ferris, you have told no one about this place? You know better than that. No. Of course you haven't. How's Dhana? Fine. Keeping busy with her school. She sends her love. You found no substitute? No substitute. Come on. Come on. These are my officers. Let's have a drink for old times. Ferris, it's good to see looking so fit. You look pretty good yourself, considering your age. Comrades again! Ferris, my friend. I'm delighted what I hear of you. You have done well. Your two thousand acres had become twenty. You have a quite money and influence, as you promised. You seem to be pretty well informed. You have prospered beyond my expectations. How could I miss. It even keeps the bullets away like you said. Yes. Yes, it's powerful. I hope it keeps them away when you find out why I've come here. I think it's time to put a muzzle on a dragon. The British accept the fact that Malaya will get its independence. All they insist on is that... the change will be orderly and democratic. Ferris. You always make me laugh. Come. Laugh with me. It's a very good joke. You, an emissary of the British. I'm not an emissary for anyone. I'm battling for myself. I'm gonna big stake in this country... and you and your bloody war are raising hell with property values. And you want me take off the war to help the bidders. I think the British are on the level this time. Of course they're on the level. They know we will win. They want to save all they can by compromise. Well, if you get what you want, how can you lose? You're always japping about independence. That is an American thing. It's sale stock. Independence. Do you really think these people can govern themselves? They can't even feed themselves. Chum, you're beginning to bore me. Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, if you don't want the truce, I'll pass the word along, but don't give me any of this Mongolian double-talk. Very well, Ferris, pass the word along. And what will you do? Return to your plantation? Grow more other? Count your money? Is there anything wrong with that? There're more important things. Helping us. For instance. You must take sides. I want to save your life. I'm offering to do it again. This is not just a local war in Malaya. It is sweeping all Asia. It will sweep Africa, South-America, the world. Still you're part of that world too what it'll swept away. You mean this won't protect me anymore. Even magic cannot protect you against stupidity. Well, I'll be off. That is if you have no objections. I have offended you. It is only because I want to protect you from yourself. You have everything, my friend. And yet you have nothing. You do not know yourself. To be truly happy, you must believe in something. Ng. Look at me! We've never lied to each other. Are you happy? Goodbye, my friend. So long, chum. Wait! Wait, Ferris! - You must have an escort. - I know my way. My man doesn't share my fondness for you. Hey, come out of there. Come out of there. I can't. Come on! Come out of there! Come on! I can't. Can you with this? Thanks. Hurry up, it's dangerous here. You don't have to be frightened. I'm really a very good swimmer. I can go 1000 miles, quite easily. I can do three minutes underwater. You're sure? I'm in excellent condition. You look like you're in good shape. Thank you, Mr. Ferris. You know me. Yes, I'm Candace Trumpey. My father is the new British commissioner. We're having a party tomorrow. Will you come? Your father should've told you not to come here. Oh, but he did. Apart from the fact that you're on my land, the territory all the way from that rock down to the bay is known as "murder mile". In the last year 33 people have been killed on that stretch. So that's why you were so alarmed when you saw me swimming, not because I haven't any clothes on. Ladies without clothes on don't alarm me, Miss Trumpey. Will you come tomorrow? Let's push her top up. You must be nuts driving around with an open car like this. I hate carrying umbrellas. Makes me look like a tourist. So it's Miss Trumpey, yeah? Oh, yes, one of the last British maids. Sort of museum piece. I'm finally convinced. Of what, Mr. Ferris? That you're the worst kind of nuisance on top. A virgin's sewing at the bar. Okay, you had your fun. Now on your way. Wait a minute. Fasten that bra a little. We don't want that to come loose in case... somebody blows your head off on the way home. Will you come tomorrow? Yes, Miss Trumpey. Thank you, Mr. Ferris. You're welcome, Miss Trumpey. Well, Ferris, we appreciate your effort. Sorry, I failed. You did your best. Idiot! If Ng don't want to listen to you, he won't listen to anybody. What the hell is going on here? Well, it's all part Dhana's demonstration, I suppose. Demonstration? - You sound surprised. - I am. Dhana and I don't talk shop. Well, I think you ought to know. Teachers from some of the union are demonstrating... against the emergency regulations. She calls it a peaceful appeal to the new representative of the British Government. I don't think it will stay peaceful for very long. Bye, Ferris. Look, we have to get there before this mob. We go a long way around Painville and Star. We'll never get through the short way. - You alright? - Yes, I'm alright. Stay with the car. These people are representative of all the unions in Malaya. And we come here with a respect, sir. Not to embarrass the new representative of the British Government. But to impress one. Now, you know as well as I do. This demonstration is a violation of the emergency regulations. We are here to protect against these very regulations, sir. You can make your protest through the proper channels. Now, all of you! Take your bicycles and get out of here! Immediately! Is this the only language which you can answer us? Just a moment. Forgive my interrupting, Tom. I'm the new British commissioner. Yes, we know. We know a lot about you, sir. And it gives us hope. That's why we here. Asking for fair treatment. Your very gracious... and diplomatic as well. But I'm afraid I must agree with the chief police officer. You're being here is a violation of the emergency regulations. The newest of the regulations. The bicycle ban. Make it is illegal to ride a bicycle after 07:30 in the evening. These people have only one method of getting to and from their jobs. And it is intolerable to take away their only means of transportation. We intend to stop this grenade throwing business, particularly from bicycles. And when these murderers raid your villages... and demand supplies and money. Tell us who they are! Then you can have your bicycles again. We'll gladly submit the bicycle ban... if the gentlemen who just spoke... will agree not to drive his Bentley after 07:30. Young lady, I've heard your request and I consider it a fair one. I shall therefore remove the bicycle ban. Beginning today... there will be no anti-bicycle restrictions. I wish to thank you, Mr. Trumpey. I'm sorry we had to troubled you with the demonstration. Not at all. We're eager to show to the people of Malaya... that we are the old friends and new allies. We have a common cause with them. To put a stop to these terrorist acts which are endangering us all equally. And to bring about... in orderly fashion... the independence of the Federation of Malaya. Hey, teacher! Ferris! What are you doing here? Cheering you on. You really gave it to Cavendish, good girl. Thank you. I had a lovely long speech ready for Mr. Trumpey... but he surrended without it. His daughter is attractive, don't you think? Anyway, he's something new in government. An honest man. I'd rather have an honest girl. You didn't mention this last night. I didn't think it was important. See you later? I'm going to attend this British function they're giving for Trumpey, I'll take you along. Better not. I'm might embarrass him. That's one of those things I think I better go to. See you tomorrow. Ferris. Be careful with the soft music and the low-cut gown. You know me. I'm merely maintaining diplomatic relations. That's what I mean. Good evening. Has he come? I haven't seen him. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening, Mr. Ferris. I didn't recognize you, right out. It's been a long time, Major. We met during the war under memorable circumstances. I must congratulate you on the way you behave today. First touch of sanity I've seen in a long time. Thank you, Major. Are you going to ask me to dance, Mr. Ferris? Certainly. I warn you, I'm a terrible dancer. I don't believe it. Sorry. You're right, you're a terrible dancer. You're dealing with an honest man. I'm so glad you came tonight. You are? Nobody thought you would. My father wanted to talk to you for ages. You know I think you could be a great help to him. In what way? Oh, your background, your knowledge of the jungle... and your friendship with this man, Ng. So that's why you've been swimming on my beach. Never underestimate the power of a clever and attractive girl. How did you know I'd be there? I was beginning to think you never would. I've been swimming there for days. What's Ng like? Sincere fellow. Hard to beat. You admire him? I admire anyone who does his job well. Are you on his side? Nothing like keeping friendly with both sides. Sorry. Is your school mistress here tonight? No, she's busy with her homework. And the Chinese dancer from the Proper Paradise? How do you manage, Ferris? I hate to disillusion you. I visit the Proper Paradise because I own it. Next question. Thank you, Mr. Ferris. - Are you alright, darling? - Oh, daddy! We got one of them. Well, it's about to get for being weak. I knew the lifting of that bicycle ban was a mistake. The bicycle ban has nothing to do with it, Cavendish. The grenade was thrown by a chauffeur. A chauffeur of a Bentley at that. I know what you think about the British, Ferris. But we've been doing this job for quite a few centuries now. And you haven't learned a thing. Mr. Ferris is on the veranda. Thank you. Do you mind a visitor? You're a fool to come here but I won't running off. Thank you. I couldn't sleep. All those people died. Did it really happened? It happened. It's lovely here. Sky. Sea. Trees. So patient. You know my father likes you. "He's the man with a dream and he needs to make that dream come true." He knows that the days of the British Empire are over. But he says really important things. Our ideas, institutions, laws, language... will go on and on. He believes that with all his heart and soul. If you believe in something enough... it could make come true. You must know that, Ferris. What's your dream? That. More rubber, more land. Palm oil too. I'm going into that the big way. You're terribly rich, aren't you? Once you have the first few dollars, it multiple like rabbits. I was born here, you know? My mother died when I was a child. I was brought up by an amah. Ah Ming. During the war I went to school in England. She spent three years in a Japanese prison camp. But when I came back she was waiting to work on me. If it is only been a few days. When father got this job, it was like the answer to a prayer. I never want to go away again. I know. I took a trip around the world a few years ago. Couldn't wait to come back. Let's swim for a while. Without politics and complications. Good idea. I'll get you a suit. I don't wear one. Remember? There is a robe hanging behind the closet door. Through there. Can I give you something to drink? Beer. Make that one milk. And some sandwiches leave me on the table. "You're a bright, soft, still folded surround." That's what they say their virgins, isn't it? So beautiful. Ferris, I don't want to swim. I know. Seems you see through me. As if I were one of those glass anatomy figures. You don't look like glass to me. What do I look like, Ferris? Flesh. Flesh is all the same, isn't it? No, it comes from different varieties. Everything from rose petal to sandpaper. And there is that number one, special type of flesh. The unknown. I'm not in love with you, Ferris. I'm relieved to hear it. I think there's something psychologically wrong with me. I've never been in love. Psychology will keep you out of the bedrooms every time. I suggest we don't talk about it. Okay. No psychology. Don't think I'm frightened. I'm not. You're infatuated with the night and the fireflies. By day the fireflies are gone. I'm too old and too scarred, Candace. As pleasant as it would be. I'm not going to help you burn yourself. I don't understand you, Ferris. Stay folded surround. Hello. Glad to see you, Dhana. You're just in time. Poor boy. You haven't always been so unlucky. Miss Candace Trumpey, this is Miss Dhana Mercier. My mistress. You've heard about her. How do you do? How do you do? My father told me about you. You don't look like a school teacher. It is after hours. I suppose you're not used to meeting mistresses, Miss Trumpey. No, I can't say that I am. Tell me, have you been a mistress for very long? Quite a while. Ferris has a phobia about marriage. If you want to change your clothes, Candace, you can use my room. Don't hurry, please. You're fooling no one with your pitter-patter, Dhana. You're sore as the devil. So why don't you let Miss Trumpey change her clothes and go home... so you can start hollering at me? I'm very sorry you're upset, Miss Mercier. Not in the least. Ferris has been unfaithful more successfully in number of times. Not so many. I like you're being forgetful. You sure didn't count. I've once read a statement in a book. To wit: "A man maybe a god for one woman but between two he must always be a clown." So let's break up this gathering. Well, I go get dressed. May I help you, Miss Trumpey? Thank you, no. I prefer to retreat alone. What are you going to do with a girl like that? Full of tender dreams about love and the moonlight. She's got a life to live. A nice, sweet, romantic life. And you're going to kick it over. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. No more oratory, please. I had a trying evening. The defence rests. Why are you all dressed up? A few friends decide to give a party after Trumpey lifted the bicycle ban. We heard about the bombing. It upset me. I came here because I wanted to forget it. You will. I'll have to do a little more forgetting than I thought. We'll manage. Good night. I'll better see you safely home. Thank you. Ferris. It's twenty minutes to her residence and back. See you in fifteen. Good morning, Miss Candace. Your breakfast is coming. You were very late in getting home last night. You were not in bed at two o'clock. I looked. You did? You saw that man, Ferris. Don't worry, Ah Ming. Nothing happened. Why don't you like him? What have you got against him? I think... I think he's marvelous. But he has a woman, Miss Candace. I know. I was introduced to her last night. Dhana. I don't think he's in love with her though. I think it's just a sort of animal relationship. That's the only kind animals can have. But it's not for you, Miss Candace. - Hello, Candy, feeling better? - Yes, I'm fine now. Thanks. And you? You alright? Well, I got a rather grim job today. We've got to carry out a reprisal. Reprisal? What for? We're going to burn down the village of the man who threw a grenade last night. What? We had a lot of trouble from this particular village. They were supplying the terrorists with arms and food. We've decide to make an example of it. But isn't it some other way? We've tried every other way. I'm sure it's a mistake. Ferris would think so. Oh, you would, would he? Look, darling. I know you find that man attractive. But don't overmatch yourself. You are not ready for man like Ferris. Bye-bye. Bye. I heard your father. A stupid thing's been done. It will make Ng very angry! What do you think of Ng? Ah Ming. You're afraid. Why? Do you think he'll hurt you? Or one of your family? Tell me! All villagers must now declare their houses. All villagers must now declare their houses. Military trucks will transport you and your belongings to the new village... which is approximately 15 minutes from here. Please ensure that all your things with you... as there will be no possibility of returning. All villagers must now declare their houses. Military trucks will transport you and your belongings to the new village... which is approximately 15 minutes from here. Please ensure that all your things with you... as there will be no possibility of returning. We've searched the whole place, sir. But there's no sign of an explosive. Well, I know there's somewhere. Alright, carry on. - Dhana, please help us! - I'll try. It's a wrong move, Trumpey. I don't think so. In the long run it will be their advantages. By destroying the homes of innocent people? Why don't you wake up, Ferris? These people aren't all innocent. While they don't stop harbouring terrorists we'll hit them harder. Perhaps they don't realize that they've been harbouring terrorists. You talk as if you're on their side, not us. This is just what they've been praying for! That we lose our heads and start destroying villages. Ng can't win them over their side. He'll be happy to see you do it for him. It is true. The people are not your enemies. I know, I teach in the school here. They're waiting for their freedom as your friends. I beg you, let them remain your friends! We're doing what we think is necessary. We've got to get these people out of here to some place... where the terrorists can't make use of them. The British have promised to turn this country over to its rightful owners. You're gonna lose it before you can give it away. Unless they destroy it themselves before we can give it back to them. We're all ready, sir. All houses have been splurged with petrol. What about the trucks? Keep them here. I know there's explosive somewhere. I want to them see why we're burning their village. - Carry on. Keep the fire is going. - Right, sir. I knew the explosive was there. Oh, Ng! Ng! - Would you like a drink, Dhana? - No. It will stop you crying. Go on, drink, please. Please. I hate them! I understand. I watched you at the burning of the village. When you hate, you don't cry. That swine colonel! If I had a gun I would have killed him. We have many guns. And many fighters. Can you use another one? You hear what you ask? Yes. All through me. I want to see their homes burning. You will see it. There's no halfway in this war. Either you trust your comrade... or you kill him. We've always trusted each other. Yes. We always have. My headquarters are at the old base. How can I reach you? One of my aides will be in constant touch with you. I wish you to know something else. I have not changed about you, Dhana. I haven't changed about Ferris. What the hell are you doing here? Why Ferris? You might at least have told me where you were. I've been looking for you for three days. I didn't want to see you. What have you been doing? I've seen Ng. I'm going to join him. I'm going away because I have to. There is nothing for me here anymore. Sit down on your packing. There are lots of things I haven't said in eight years. I'd like to start saying them now. I want you, Dhana. And Ferris always gets what he wants. The devil with anything else. I'll have nothing if you pull out on me. Just a few dancing girls and your new English friend. Your evenings will be taken care of. Your arithmetic's all wrong. They only have lapse of improve edges. I only have one girl. You. No. Not me. Not anymore. I'm gonna take a trip next week. I want you to come along. We had our trips, Ferris. This time it will be different. It will be legal. With a license embroidered down the pillow. I know I'm not much of a catch. You are not the marrying kind, Ferris. I've always accepted that fact. But I have no regrets. Alright. I promise, no more girls. And no more politics for you. You understand? No more politics. Ferris, I love you. Please, take me away. Please. Sorry, ma'am. What's the matter? Constable! Search her basket. I want a gin and tonic, please. Well, hello! Pleasure before business. This can wait. Gin and tonic for the young lady. How nice to be welcomed for a change. My cafe is open to all customers. Very romantic. Nice setting for what goes on. Which reminds me... What are you doing here? Not to seducing you. Actually I happen to raise funds for the new school. I did tell it for you about it. But you didn't return my call. Good idea. I'll double what you raise. Thanks. Why did you really come? I wanted to see you. Do you think that's very forward? Not at all. You see me. You have a drink. What else? A dance? You must be a glutton for punishment. I am. Sorry. You hold me closer, it won't hurt so much. - Is that better? - Lovely. - What's your first name, Ferris? - I haven't one. My parents were Quakers. They didn't believe in thrills and ornaments. They thought that one name was good enough. Bloody liar. Anyway I like it. Excuse me. What's up, Tom? I've got some bad news for you, Ferris. Dhana has been arrested. Arrested. Why? For terrorist activities. Terrorist activities? That's ridiculous. - What's it all about? - That's all I know. Colonel Cavendish seek out the facts and Mr. Trumpey. Dhana was arrested about an hour ago on the Beijing Road. She was riding a bicycle with a large durian fruit strapped to the carrier. The durian had been hearted out, inside it was two armed grenades. You know as well as I do Dhana's no grenade thrower. She's not that stupid. Nevertheless she was carrying the grenades. She has been arrested by the military police on the information they've received. All that means is that Dhana was framed. You'll have a chance to prove that at the trial. Stop being so legalistic and be reasonable! Dhana frequently brings back fruits and vegetables from that village up there. Anyone could have planted those grenades. Even Cavendish. I'm sorry, she has to be trialled like anyone else... who breaks the emergency regulations. Trumpey, I warn you. You go ahead with this and you'll have the whole peninsula against you. People love Dhana. The law must take its course. Good night. What will happen to her? She'll get a fair trial. And if she's guilty? That depends. She'll hang? The emergency regulations make it a capital offence... for persons to carry unlicensed firearms and that includes grenades. The girl hasn't a chance, Ferris. A silence is as good as a confession in any court. It'll be a fair trial. It is only one verdict possible: Hanging. Couldn't be fair. When can I see her? In a moment. - Tought we might have a talk first. - What about? Saving the girl's life. I'm listening. The girl won't hang in return for information. We want your friend, Ng. Dead or alive. You're not on his side, Ferris. Look, Ferris. I know how you feel about Ng. But you can't carry loyalty this far. What kind of loyalty is it that let your girl hang... and ruin your own life? I won't do it. There're some things a man can't do. I have no politics, no morals. There's nothing inside of me but me! That me can break all the laws... but it can't betray a friend. Damn you for asking! Now, think it over, Ferris. It's maybe the girl's last chance. I thought you might like talk it over with her. We'll leave you alone for a while. How are you, dear? Much better now you here. Against regulations. Oh, to hell with regulations. Now listen. Please don't worry. I'm flying out the best available counsel from London. I'm afraid it'll never get me off. The evidence is against me. But I'm innocent, believe me. I have no idea where those grenades came from. I think you were framed by Cavendish or the others. They ask me to inform on Ng in exchange for your life. They have asked me too. But I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it either. I would have hated you if you had. Just as much I would hate myself. How would we feel in the nights ahead? Two people are looking aware one another in the dark. Cannot be worth your life. Ferris, we are what we are. We can't shame ourselves for price. You know what it's like to look at you now? Like a thousand years of living. Dhana if I should lose you... You haven't lost me yet. Let's face it together until after the trial. And in addition to this evidence offered... the prisoner's refusal to answer any questions... put by the officers of this court... is sufficient proof of her guilt... of the crime preffered against her... during the time of military emergency. Before the verdict is pronounced. This court offers to the prisoner a final chance... to win the clemency of the court... by giving it certain military information she holds secret. Does the prisoner wish to make a statement? I have no statement to make. Except to repeat what I have said many times during the course of this trial. I am absolutely innocent of the charge made against me. This court finds the prisoner, Dhana Mercier... guilty of conspiring with enemy terrorists... in the murder of innocent Malayan and British people. The penalty for such action is death. The court will rise. The sentence of this court upon you is... that you'll be taken from this place to a lawful prison... and then to a place of execution... and that you'll there suffer death by hanging. - Tell him to come and see me tomorrow. - Yes, sir. What will happen now? She'll appeal to a higher court. Has she a chance? Not much. Then you have to help her! You're the only one who can see the sentence is commuted. - If you speak the word... - I can't. Not unless she talks. She can help us. Father. I don't believe she's guilty. Do you? Yes, I do. Look, darling, there are several million Malayans who want to govern themselves... in a decent orderly way and make better lifes for themselves. I'm trying to help them. There's something poisonous out there in the jungle trying to stop me. Something's trying to create chaos. I'm going to stop this thing! If people like Dhana killed in the process... I'm sorry I can't help it. What about Ng? He must be human. There must be some way to appealing to him. Candace, I must ask you not to interfere in this. I just can't believe that hanging Dhana will help you. Thank you for seeing me. It's nice of you. Why was it important to see me this morning? There can't be much to say. Dhana, you can still save yourself. Answer the questions and you're free. I have already been trialled, Miss Trumpey. I shall not change my defence now. It could be so easy for you. You're going to die, Dhana. For a murderer who doesn't give an attempt for you. My father has promised Malaya's freedom. What more can Ng want? He wants more than promises. I'm not agree with Ng's methods. But I do know that freedom is never won easily. I don't understand you, Dhana. You don't believe in Ng yet you prepare to die for him. Don't think for a moment. But I hadn't taken this decision lightly. The real trial for me has been the struggle within myself. Tell me. If somebody you love committed a crime, could you betray him? During the three years we spent in the jungle... Ng and Ferris became my... my family. A bond was formed between us. Which time and circumstances cannot break. I belong to them equally. In different ways. And Ferris? What's going to happen to Ferris? You love him, don't you? Yes. I do. Then you must help him. You must help him to forget me. He will need you, Candace. Only I know how much. Would you do this for me? She fights for the people always. Who will fight for us now when she dies? What about Ng? What about him? You can trust me. He is a god. You're Ng. I've seen your photograph in the newspapers. So... You are the daughter of the British resident. I've seen you several times with this. Who knew your coming, apart from Ah Ming? No one. She told me to meet you here. What did you do with your car? I left it down there. Where it's could to be seen? Yes, I'm afraid I did. That was stupid of me. Why did you come here? Tell me. To save Dhana. If I become a hostage they will be forced to let her go. - Are you armed? - No. We will see. Stand still! When I say something, you ought to obey! Come on. Thanks for coming, Tom. Sorry I've been so long. I just got your message. What's all this about? How long is Dhana got? Seven days at most. Why? I'm going after Ng. But I think I'll need more time. Are you sure it is the right what you do, Ferris? Why don't you tell us where he is? We'll get him. You'd never get within five miles of him. He'd know the moment you made a move. Believe me, Tom. This is the best way and I think I'm the only one who get through. But you got to get me more time. How long do you want? Ten days at least. Alright. I see Trumpey right away. You'll get it. You have my word. And Ferris, you're doing the right thing. I've got no alternative. No, I don't think you have. Good luck! No one follows me! Alright. Driver, get out! Tell to move out of the way. They knew you were coming. No. Then they have found your car. And they're searching for you. Come on! Your refusal to save your own life by what you consider a betrayal of a friend... was an understandable matter to me. To anyone who has been a soldier. However the situation has changed. You're not only condemning yourself to death, you're killing a young woman, a perfectly innocent, young woman. What I've heard... Candace have admired you very much Only you can save her now. You can save her or you can kill her. I pray she's saved. But I cannot tell you anything. Except that I'm innocent of any crime. Make it possible for me to release you. It is within your power to release me now... and save your daughter. Do you really think I'll give in to Ng's threat? Excuse me, sir. One of our patrols has stumbled across a large base in the jungle. They feel it could be Ng's headquarters. A strong force is on his way to take it now. What happens if Candace is there? Maybe it could be her only chance. Are you ill? Oh, no. I feel just great, thanks. Will Ferris coming after you? Why should he? Is he not in love with you? No. Or he not make love to you? No. That is not like Ferris. No, I don't suppose it is. Could I ask why you were at the durian tree? I told you. You will tell us the truth. I wanted to save Dhana. I thought if I became a hostage I can force them to set her free. You and Dhana... are on the opposite sides. When you help Dhana... you hurt the cause you believe in. We believe that human beings are more important than causes. I will have the truth from you! Torturing me won't do you any good. You understand? What you intend to do with me? If Dhana had hang... you will be given to my soldiers. When they are down with you. You will be killed. Then small details had been conveyed to your father. This is your doing. Come on! How? You have drifted them here. No. How did they find this place? Perhaps Ferris told them. No. He would not. Perhaps he knows now what a sneak you are. Lost, aren't you? You don't know where you are. Go on. Hit me. Ferris! Stop! Don't come any closer! I've been watching you go around in circles for hours. I could have shot you anytime. I'm taking her to my other base. Four hour more. Still the old jungle boob, are you Ng? - You're sure no one followed you? - No one. Let's get something straight. - I'm gonna take her back with me. - No, Ferris. You think I'm going to let you hang her? It was a clever scheme. Trumpey will lose face both ways. I will let her go if Trumpey releases Dhana. Trumpey won't. He's the worst kind of Englishman. Absolutely honourable. He'll do his duty. So that's why I'm taking her back home with me. I beg, stop! Sorry, chum. If you come any closer I'll have to kill you. Get the gun and keep him covered. Stand up, Ng! Hands back! I'm taking you back, Ng. I have to save Dhana. You ready to travel, Candace? I'm fine now. Alright Ng, you walk behind me. Candace you stay five feet behind him and keep your gun on him. We are way off track. So we head through there. You packing up? We'll never make it, Ferris. The execution is on thursday. We got a few extra days. The CPO's arranging it for us. But the CPO has been killed. - When? - I don't know. Ng's men were talking about it in the hut. It means we only got three days. You'll never get there in time. You haven't come a hundred yard in the last hour. Give up, Ferris. Leeches! Take them off me! Take them off me! - If the two of us cutting we have a chance. - Ferris, no! What do you say, Ng? Do you really think I'd help you? My way is the only way. Ferris. Shoot me now. Get it over. Your friend, the British will hang me anyway. I want your help. I'll take them off you if you'll help. Only as far as the coast. Alright. Alright. Ferris, don't trust him. Take them off. No, Ferris. Swear on it. Swear on your father's spirit you won't double-cross me. Until we see the coast... there will be peace between us. I swear it. Get the parang, cut him loose. What are you going to do, Ng, when we get to the coast? I will try to capture you, Miss Trumpey. And take you back with me. Kill me? If Dhana is hanged, yes. He means it, Candace. We'll make better time now. Only two more days to go. Ferris! Look! This is a Shenoi trail. Leads to the coast. - How do you feel? - Now, marvelous. Have a drink, you deserve it. A toast to our friendship. He's not lost anymore. He knows where we are. I can see it in his eyes. He won't try anything until we see the coast. He promised. How can you believe him? The way I have to. If I didn't I couldn't beleive in anything. That's rough, even for me. He's twisted and perverted. A murderer. He's not the man you knew. I'm not the man he knew. You know where we are, don't you? If we were not near to our goal, you would never stop for rest. She needed it. But you're right. We're gonna make it. Ferris. We're still friends, right? Come with me. And find a new goal. Not on your life. Tell me. Could you really have hang that? I would have regretted it. But one must go in one direction nor the other. There is no middle road. Still full of broken glass. Ferris. Why didn't you shoot? I couldn't, Ferris. I couldn't. I've got to get him. We only got till dawn tomorrow. Stay here! I had to do it. I had to do. He would have killed you, oh god! I had to shoot him! You double-crossed me. No, Ferris. I swore. Till I saw the coast. At dawn I climbed a tree. A tall one. I saw the coast. I didn't break my promise. Ferris. If he yells, they'll find us. My men? Gone. Thanks. No, Ferris. Sorry you wouldn't join me. We would have won together. Now one of us has lost. Don't talk. Take it easy. Ferris. I must tell you something. I had the grenades put in the durian. I was ordered to. You framed Dhana? Why? You loved her. Everybody loved her. That is why. When they hang Dhana they destroy themselves. In our cause we're all expendable. Dhana. I... You dirty scum! Do you realise what you've done? Do you realise? Thank you. Hello, Dhana. Hello, Mr. Trumpey. I thought in this late hour you might feel differently. You don't have much time left. Will you really let this happen... when you can save yourself here and now by saying just a few words? I'm sorry. Let me ask you a question. You have considerable experience of life. I don't think you have many illusions left. Is it worth? You waste your life for what you believed in. Now are you willing to give up something even more precious. Your daughter's life. Is it worth to you? I'm sorry you're risking Candace's life for your convictions. Goodbye, Dhana. Goodbye. Mr. Trumpey. Any news of Ferris? Nothing. You're a good soldier, Candace. Am I? You've grown a lot in the last week. There's a bridge a mile ahead. Make all the difference whether we get back in time. I'm ready, Ferris. Don't worry. We will back before dawn. Oh, god! Oh, god! We got to go on. There's another way. We got to go on. Lord! Make me an instrument of your peace. Where there is hatred... let me show love. Where there is intrigue, pardon. Where there is discord, union. Where there is doubt, faith. Where there is despair, hope. Where there is sadness, joy. For it is in giving what we recieve. It is in pardoning that we are pardoned. And it is in dying that we are born into eternal life. Come, Dhana. They've found us, Candace. Mr. Ferris is outside. The doctor say you stay in bed one day more. Show him in. Ferris. I'm glad to see you. You look fine. So do you. It's been a long time. Why do you come to see me now? Going to take a trip. May never come back. You're the man who took a trip around the world and couldn't wait to get back. She's here, Candace. She'll always be here. Everything I see or touch. Everytime I walk into a room. Everytime a girl in bright shirt rides past on bicycle. I think how beautiful she was and what they did to her. They didn't do it. Not really, Ferris. Ng did it. You know that. I'm not blaming anyone but myself. I destroyed her because I was too busy and too selfish... to give her a secure place in my life. If I hadn't failed her... maybe she wouldn't have gone out looking for causes to die for. Ferris. Let me come with you. I know you love her but I can help you. I'm alive. If you weren't so damn worthwhile I'll take you on for a fling. That's all it would be. Not bad one for you. I'm in love with every hour she lived. I love you, Ferris. I just want to be with you. I'm not a little girl anymore. I'm grownup now. In some ways I'm older than you are. It doesn't have to be marriage or complications. Just me like Dhana. And you. Candace. Go on find me when I was twenty one. You'll want it like mad. Ferris. Did you see my girl? She seems okay. She'll be as right as rain in a few days. - I hope we see you again soon. - Thanks. Ferris, you once warn me about what would happen if any harm came to Dhana. What it's happening. I can feel the hate and bitterness when I walk down the street. But you know the truth, Ferris. And the time will come when they'll all know it. Then they will know Ng for what he was. And the thing he worshipped for what it is. Meanwhile... I'll continue to blunder through in the same old way. Goodbye. Trumpey. Yes? Best of luck to you! Well, thanks. Thanks, Ferris.
