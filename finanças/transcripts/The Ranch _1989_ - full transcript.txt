[theme music] ANNOUNCER (ON RADIO): Flashy new tune from a guy called Gary Vilgar departing from up north of the 49th parallel. The guys refer to down here as a frost back. But it's nice to get something from up there rather than another cold front, isn't it? Definitely no problem with that today. It's going to be another scorcher in Apple, or as they say in Canada, it's going to be hot, eh? As we say down here it's going to damn hot, man. Get out of my face. It is 7:29 with the Reverend Good Morning. You'd better shake it up. You're going to be late, and try to come up with a man excuse than the alarm didn't go off. Try this one. It worked for me. I'm sorry, Mr. Scridlow, but the neighbors kept me up all night polishing their dog. And you know how noisy that can be, especially with on of those new electric dog polishers with the feets and the tweets and neat power raker bar. Trust me, that will get you off the hook. Did you read the headlines this morning? Mouthwash madness? Somebody is on the hook in this big pooh. You gotta check your bottle out, but stay away from this stuff, especially if you have a big interview. Unless they were planning on hiring Mickey Mouse anyway. FIFI: Good morning. Good morning, Fifi. Jackson, what is it? Well? What? Speak to me. (FEMALE VOICE) We've got a problem. What's wrong with your voice? (FEMALE VOICE) A mix up at the lab. Macho Mouthwash has developed some strange side effects. Mouthwash? Oh, my god. We got to stop the shipments. The went out yesterday. (FEMALE VOICE) Didn't you get Kevin's memo? Memo? (FEMALE VOICE) We shipped 200,000 cases. Rosie? Shafferton. Has old man McDanell heard the news? Ah! Ah! (FEMALE VOICE) He's heard. Never mind. Yo, Bare. Train late from the city, or what? Ah, Louis. Leslie wasn't there to pick me up. Have you seen her? Yeah. As a matter of fact, I did. Listen, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but she split, man. What do you mean? Where did she go? Hey, pal, I don't know. But she must have given the address to the guys in the van. Van? What van? The movers. They just left a little while ago. What movers? What are you talking about? That's not all. She took the Porsche too, hon. My car? She took my car? What the hell is going on here? Hey, listen, don't let it get to you, bud. So the chick has got your car. You'll get another one. I mean, it's not like she took your McDonald's stock or anything. And the furniture, well, she's done you a favor. A favor? She moved out my furniture. You call that do me a favor? Well, you had to move it anyway. Here. Feast your eyes on this. It's your notice to vacate. Vacate? Hey, it was an offer I couldn't refuse. The company wanted every house on the block. They paid top dollar for it. So you gotta get out. I had no choice. All my tenants got to vacate. And I knew you'd cooperate so I signed for you, buddy. You signed my name? Ah, Tony. Listen, I gotta run. I promised I'd take the lady shopping. Oh, this came for you. It's from some lawyer up town. It seems like some relative croaked and well, left you something. Talk about your lucky day. Well, gotta run. Ciao, babe. Mr. Shafferton? Yes. Mr. Hutchinson. Yes. Everything seems to be in order. I'm going to just need some signatures before we proceed. Sit down, please. No one has told me exactly what it is my uncle left me. Oh, of course. It's real estate. He's left you his ranch property in Alberta. Alberta? Canada. Oh, land. Yes. Land. Yes. Real estate. Yes. All right. Mr. Shafferton, please, this is a business office. I have always been intrigued by real estate and its fringe benefits. Real estate. It is so solid. But just how big is this place anyway? Just under 1,000 acres. 1,000 acres? Yes! Yes! Yesterday unemployment. Today development city! Whew! [dog barking] Hello. Are you here for me? You Shafferton? Yeah. Yeah, you can call me Barry. I'm Cody. Welcome to Alberta. Are we going to get this crate moving, or are we going to sit here till we rust up? Well, I've got some luggage. I can see that. Toss it in. Me and Brandy about ready for supper. [honks horn] City boys. [rooster crowing] Who does he think he is any ways, the Shah of Iran? Imagine walking in here and asking for all types of fancy foods for supper. Demanding to know just who I was. Well, I didn't expect him to be so young. What do you think he'll do? I know what he won't do. He won't be sashaying around my kitchen. I don't care who he thinks he is. I never thought it would happen. Old man Shafferton giving the ranch away. Nothing in life is what you expect. Nothing. Look at that. 7:30 and I'm still at the dishes. He's already turning the place all up and skedaddled around here. But things are going to change. OK, New York, you've got two minutes to move that skinny body of yours out of that bed, or I'm going to move it for you. What the hell are you doing? Get out of my room. Look, Big Apple, nobody sleeps when I work. Right now I plan to make this bed, so get the hell up and out of here. Shit! There. That ought to keep you going, girl. Horses look real good, Jess. The boys should be impressed. Impressed? Not by these horses, I'll bet. Maybe if they were a polo pony. Now daughter, give the boy a chance. Hell, it's his ranch now. Well, I doubt if he'll keep it long. Country life just isn't for him, you know? And I think he's probably the type that will sell out just about as fast as he can. Sell out? But there's no buyers, at least not now. There's always a buyer at the right price. Cody! Don! Anybody! Yeah, we're in here. Hey, fellas, this place stinks. Let's get somebody in here to clean it up. Where is everybody? where is the rest of the staff? Right here. What do you mean? Only to of you? Well, there's three. Jesse is out back, and there's four if you count Ruby. But for a ranch this size, it's ridiculous. Now, just hold it there, boy. You put those animals away! Now, take it easy, chief. Those calves are pretty tame for the most part. Clean this place up. I'm going to take a shower. [laughter] Oh, Ruby is it? Can I have my coffee in here, please? Hm. Excuse me? Look, I am willing to forget about our little incident this morning, but I would like my coffee in here now, please. You want coffee? Then go make it yourself. Don't you mess up my kitchen. What? Me? You're the cook. It's your job. A job is where you work and somebody pays you. Nobody is paying me and hasn't for a long time. I live here. If the house needs cleaning, I clean it. And if you want coffee and it ain't meal time, then you go make it yourself. Look, I thought-- You thought that you were still in New York where there was all kinds of people who will take your brand of bullshit. Well, you're not. Obviously. But if you're not employees, then why are you here? You may own this ranch, but you don't own us. We've kept this place going as best we could. Them bills will tell you that. I hope you inherited a pile of money when you inherited this ranch 'cause you're going to need it. Cody. Yeah. I need to go into town, to the bank. OK. Sounds like a hell of an idea. You know, I've got to get a few things for the horses anyway. Let's go. BARRY: What's the bank manager like? CODY: Let's put it this way, I'd rather waltz with a bear. BARRY: Do you think there's a chance for a loan? CODY: I wouldn't bet money on it. I gave up on bank managers a long time ago. BARRY: Where's Don going? CODY: He spends every Tuesday talking about the old days over at the barbershop. Here you go. I'm going to the Elkana. Tip a few. I'll see you in there. You boys have fun. I'll pick you up at closing time. Wish me luck. You go get 'em, boy. [MUSIC - JESSE BURNS, "THE WRONG MR. RIGHT"] I met let wrong Mr. Right hold me just a little too tight. Make me feel a little too right. Hey, Sweetheart. This ain't your kind of bar. We don't like city boys around here. Hi, fellas. Don't worry about it. I think it's going to take them a while to get used to you. Did you find out what you wanted to know? JENNY: Hi, honey. What will you have? A double vodka spritzer, please. Say what? CODY: He'll have a beer, Jenny. OK. So did you? Well, yes and no. I found out what I asked for, but it was not what I wanted to know. I kind of think maybe you were expecting the Ponderosa Ranch. No. Well, yeah. I guess so. Oh, yes. Money. Thanks. Keep bringing them, Jenny. JENNY: OK. I think we're going to be here for a while. [laughing] OK, boys, last call. Oh, come on, Jenny. You know, you are a really beautiful person. No, I Really mean that. All right. Keep them coming, Jenn. We're doing just fine. Oh, I can see that. Will you marry me? Sure, honey. Sure. But first, I have to finish this shift. Cody, she is a really beautiful person. I really mean that. [MUSIC - ELDORADO, "WANNA BE A COUNTRY SINGER"] I want to be a country singer. I want to ride on reso bus. I want to act kind of silly, try to sing a nip. Won't you find me so fast and make a fuss. I'll be all rich when I'm up on the stage. I want to be a country singer. I'll hit number one. Have my day in the sun. I want to be a country singer 'cause country singers have fun. I want to be a country singer. I want to do all the things I please. Hey. Hey. Hey, Cody. Cody! Hey, Cody! Hey. Hey, stop it. Hey, wait. Wait a minute. Stop it. Stop it. [sighing] Couldn't you manage to work someplace else? Ruby wouldn't let me sleep in. What is your problem? No problem. No problem at all. You know something? All of you people have a severe attitude problem. How about a little gratitude considering you all live here for free on my property. Live free? Why you ignorant, smug little bastard. I guess you never out of work a day in your life. You're saying I live free? Well, it is my property. Before that it was my uncle's. And my guess is you were all just a bunch of disgruntled ex-employees hoping to be rehired. Your uncle won this ranch. He tricked my dad into putting up the ranch in a poker game. Mr. Shafferton, he took the deed and the liquid assets and forgot about it. My dad, he hasn't taken a drink since that night. I had no idea. We've been keeping this place going all these years, paying for the taxes and the upkeep when we could. Why didn't you just invoice his accountants then? Invoice his accountants? You don't have a clue, do you? We tried. They told us to sell everything and vacate the property. We had to get a court order to get them to allow us to stay. Without money, how could we run it right? Oh, Jessie. Jessie, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Well, there's a lot you don't know. Wait. So how do you keep it going now? Dad's pension for the most part. Whatever I can make waitressing. You know, you think you'd have the decency to will this place back to Dad. Jessie, I'm sorry you lost the place, but it's all I have now too. If I can't make it work, then I've got nothing. Well, let me buy the place back from you. Look, I don't make much, but I got a little in the bank, and I could pay in installments. No. No, I'm not selling. Bastard. You're no better than your uncle. Don't let her concern you, son. The ranch is rightfully yours, and we're just actively letting her stay on. Yeah, but Jessica. Jessie? She loves the place all right, but she'll do just fine any place. [MUSIC - MICHAEL PAUL DEMENJES, "I'VE GOT A FEELING IT'S GOING TO RAIN"] I made it home so late last night. Something that I've done before. I could see that the lights were on, and you were waiting at the door. I've got a feeling that I've done it this time. That precious pilot is starting to climb. What, are you all right? I will be. We're almost there. Damn well better be worth it. I'm in serious pain here. [MUSIC - MICHAEL PAUL DEMENJES, "I'VE GOT A FEELING IT'S GOING TO RAIN"] I don't know what possessed me to do all the things I've done to you. The sun was shining just yesterday, and now its dawn is on its way. Those icy chills running up and down my spine. The clouds are forming, and it's raining in my mind. I've got a feeling clouds moving in your heart. I've got a feeling it's going to rain. There you go, Barry. Hangover Heaven. God. This is one-- I feel fantastic. Well, you know it's a sure fire remedy. I'm here and the mud that hit you from the inside. Some hot mud for the outside. I can't move. I feel damn good. Say, what's in this stuff? You know, I don't know. There's something in his mud is about the only thing that's helped me since my accident. Accident? It's nothing serious. What you do in New York? I was an executive. That's just a glorified salesman. Someday I'll tell you all about it. You know, this place is absolute nirvana. I never knew it, but you cowboys got it made. I suppose there's nothing like this back in a big city. Like slap butt on the faces of spoiled oil rich women, but nothing like this. So you're not going to give up on our flea-bitten excuse for a ranch? No way. Uncle Bob probably thought is was a big joke when he willed it to me, but at least this flea-bitten excuses is mine. Hell, ours. [laughing] [gun shots] That came from the house. Let's go. Now, Ruby, just calm down. We go through this every year. And every year I tell you the same thing. It's not my ranch, and them aren't my taxes. I just live here. Now get. But Ruby, you know I got to serve the notice. It's my job, and you make it tougher every year. Besides, sooner or later, somebody is going to take care of it. [dog barking] What's going on? Who are you? My name is Norbert Tase from the county courthouse. I was just delivering the tax report to Ruby like I do every year. Well, I'm the new owner here. Give it to me. New owner? Well, congratulations, sir. Are you a Canadian citizen? Yes, from New York State. My name is Barry Shafferton. US of A, aye? Well, this then is for you, sir. We expect payment. No more delays. Sorry about that. I'll take care of everything. $10,000. Plus $1,200 in back interest. Why did you tell them you own the damn place? I've been putting them guys off for the past 10 years, and they could have waited another 10 for all I care. The taxes have to be paid. You can't just keep putting them off. We could lose the ranch. Well, it didn't seem to matter so long as I kept them away and there was no one they could serve their damn papers to. Facts are facts. Now they want their cash. Good god, $11,200. Well, I can't let this happen. I am not going to lose anything anymore. Well, if I could make 80 grand a year selling colored water, I could sure pull something out of this place. Maybe you could talk to them again. Maybe we should have stayed in the mud. What I say? I'm not sure, but I think you may have caught on to something. What? What? Well, he said maybe we should have stayed in the mud. And maybe that's our answer. I really don't understand. Today, Cody took me out to the mud baths. RUBY: Yeah. So? He takes everyone out there after he's been on a bender. Well, don't you get it? Those mud baths could be worth a fortune I think you'd better head back to the big city. I think the clean air is getting to you. No. Here me out. My old girlfriend, Buffy, used to spend thousands of dollars going to health spas and fat farms and natural clinics. Well, every time he needed a rest, she disappeared in one of those places, dumped a pile of money, and come back feeling great. Yeah, but those places all need tons of equipment. No. Not all of them. Well, the newest ones are like going to boot camp. They put you up in dorms. They make you exercise and breathe fresh air. Well, we got everything we need right here, almost. How about feeding all those city folks? That's just the thing. They practically starving them to death. And we've got the mud. Exactly. It's a natural. It might work, son, but you're going to need some money. Well, I sort of thought you all might help me out. Well, I'll pay you back after everything is paid off. With a bonus. All right. And a fat salary to boot. No. What do you mean no? This is our ranch. If you want the money, I suggest we form a partnership. OK. Sure. You can all work with a percentage. M-m. 50/50. Ownership of the ranch and the spa. Well, partners on the ranch? Oh, you gotta be kidding. This was Don's ranch and would be Jessie's I'd rather see the government get it than the likes of some city dude. Looks like you've got a Mexican standoff, man. [laughing] Ah, what the hell. I'll do my part. Just keep those city folks out of my kitchen. Hot dog. God. I'm sorry. [laughing] - Wait. Wait. Truce. Truce. Truce. Looking real good, eh? Well, I think Jessie is doing a real fine job. Well, we should do pretty well with customers out of these, I think. These are nice-looking boots. [whistling] Well, what do you think? I don't think much. Do I look like a cowboy? You sure do look like a cowboy. Yee dawgy! OK, here are the rest of the brochures. Now, this is very important. How long for these to get to New York City? Oh, for you, Mr. Shaferton, about four days. Shafferton. Right. Definitely. Hello, "Spa Review," can you please connect me to your publisher? Yes, Ms. Greenberg. My name? Sissy Van Ellington. Oh, Andrea, Darlene. I am surprised. I just spent two fabulous weeks in Canada at the most wonderful rustic spa. And I find that no one, just no one has heard of it from you. Andrea dear, you must know about it. You always know about the best places. Are you sure you haven't been keeping this place your own special secret? I mean, I went through all your back issues and there was nothing, but nothing, dear. Thank heavens Liz told me over lunch. But I thought you were on top of everything. Oh, Wild Rose Ranch. I have it right here. Brag Creek, Alberta. In Canada, dear. It's so-- so basic, so wonderfully fresh. You owe it to your readers, dearest. Wonderful. Love your column on hot oils. Must run. Kisses. Well, what she say? She said she hasn't missed coverage on a good spa yet. And I can count on seeing it in a future issue. Jessie, you are fantastic. You're a natural. Put it there, partner. What was that for? People been shoveling bull crap at us all these years. Dishing some of it back is a pleasure. Yeah? Well, cross your fingers and hope that Ms. Greenberg does that article on us, Ruby. Because it could make us all rich. And famous? You're doing fine, girl. You're just doing fine. They are beautiful. Where did they come from? Matt Samuelsen. I owned a sum of his stock. I think pretty girl here might need a little more work. Anyway, Jessica, could you bring that doctor bills? Sorry. I forgot. You forgot? What? You know, you're not too big for me to take you over my knee. But you're going to have to catch me first. Jessie, is that you? No, it's Hulk Hogan. Of course, it's me. Whoa. What's wrong with you? Gee. I think you've been in the sun too long. Ruby? Ruby. Whoa, Jessie. Looking good. Think so? I'm breathless. Do I look like an activities coordinator? Kelly did a complete makeover on me. Said she wanted to do it for years. You are perfect. You don't think something more sporty would be better. No. No, not at all. In fact, you look great. Well, it's still me under the makeup. I know. I know. In fact, I'm still kicking myself for not noticing your potential before. Maybe I should have done this a while ago. BARRY: Five bookings. Five. Obviously, I've failed somewhere in my marketing strategy. But where? - It's a start. Oh, god, why doesn't she call? [grunting] Cancellation, right? No, a booking. Another one of them hoity-toity, New York types. New York. Yeah. Name of Greenblatt, Greenwald, something like that. Greenberg? Wait. Andrea Greenberg? Yeah. How did you know? Well, why didn't you say so? Just take it easy, boy. Real pushy woman, you know? Kept demanded some got a special treatment. Hell, I told her she was going to get exactly what everybody else got. Are you crazy? She's the publisher of "Spa Review," the bible of the health and fitness set. Of course, she gets special treatment. If we disappoint her, we're finished. Ah, this is the woman who single handedly destroyed the tourist trade in Saint-Moritz because they allowed her to get a sunburn. Oh, calm down. She's going to love it here. DON: Especially with all the improvements we've done. I don't believe it. She's going to expect Club Med. All we've got is Maw and Paw Yokum and dogpatch. This is going to be a disaster. KATHY: Oh, I love it. It's so minimalist. Well, hello there, cowboy. You're from the Wild Rose, I hope. That's right, ma'am. Great. I was worried the spa didn't offer my favorite form of exercise. Ah, ladies, if you'd get in the car, I'd be happy to get your luggage. Miller, is this your idea of a short cut? Sorry Ms. Greenberg, but this is the only access road to the spa. How long on this road? About 16 miles. [speaking french] [honking horn] Ladies. Ladies, welcome to the Wild Rose Ranch. My name is Barry Shafferton. I'm the spa's general manager. So ah, where's the bar? Oh, sorry, ladies. No bar. No central air conditioning. No television. No bar? Ladies, you're here to revitalize yourselves, to re evaluate your physical and emotional potential. My emotional potential was revitalized when I got my divorce. My name is Jessie McCafferty, and I'll be your activities coordinator for this session. Consider this to be like boot camp. Yeah, cowboy boot camp. This will be an event in your lives, one week guaranteed to change them for the better. If you all come inside with me, I'll introduce you to the rest of the staff. Oh. Miller, take it easy. Everybody, this is Ruby. She's our dietitian in charge of the menus, balancing starches, fats, and proteins. Ruby, these are our first guests. Hello. This is-- Renee. Lisa. Estelle. Alice. I'm Kathy. Welcome, ladies. Oh, an antique Cuisine Art. Out. Out. Out you go. Ruby. Now, rule number 1, ladies. See this black line? It's there for a very good reason. Nobody, but nobody steps into this kitchen but me. It's off limits, you here? Well, actually, that's a good rule. Because some people like to snack, and we can't have that. Now, ladies if you'll just come with me into the living room, we'll get comfy in here. She doesn't have a shotgun, does she? Oh, no. No. No. Her bark is worse than her bite, really. Ah, Ms. Greenberg. Barry Shafferton? Yes. Yes. Well, excuse me for staring. I was expecting someone much older. Oh, come now, Mr. Shafferton, you don't honestly think that my mother would waste her time in a place like this, do you? This better be good. This better be damn good. Oh, it is. I admit the road situation is a problem. A problem? Listen, just show me to my room, a shower, and the damn phone. I'll go through these formalities later. [screaming] I'm sorry. Here, let me help you up. That's it. We're finished. She hates it already. What she doing, packing? Packing? She hasn't unpacked yet. Well, maybe she'll feel better after a hot shower. Oh, god. The hot water is hooked up, isn't it? Not yet. Should it be? Should it be? ANDREA: Ah! I hate cold showers! Now, are you sure this person has a phone? Definitely. Wait! Wait, Andrea! Andrea, wait. Just give us an extra chance, please? Just a few more days. I have a responsibility to my readers. This place ought to be condemned. Don! Don, you trader! How could you do this to me? How could you do it to us? Andrea. Andrea, wait, please. Andrea! Ah. Ah! You know what, Alice, this place is fabulous. I couldn't agree more. Oh, by the way, Estelle, did you know that Andrea from "Spa Review Magazine" is here? She's going to be taking lots and lots of pictures. You're kidding? I read that magazine all the time. We'd better make our tooshes look good. Speaking of cute tooshes, don't you think that Barry is a hunk-a-roo? Oh, I agree. You better watch out, Estelle. You're going to have some competition in me. Tell you what, Alice. I'll have Barry Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. You can have him Tuesdays and Thursdays, only longer hours. All is fair in love and war, Estelle. It's a deal. Hold that pose. Get it? Got it. Good. ANDREA: This is absolutely incredible. I never imagined it could be this beautiful. Yeah, when I was a young boy, I dreamt of moving to the city-- Calgary, Toronto, hell, even New York. You're lucky you never left. You're very lucky. - Over there, boy. That's it. Hell, I used to look at this country as one large snow-covered forest. It started at the American border and went right on up to the North Pole. I guess I got that idea from all those old Sergeant Renfrew and Rose-Marie movies. Real fairy tales, them things. We saw them too. You know, your manager ought to be arrested. This is no spa. But well, it does have a certain allure to it. We like it. Well, I'm here now, so I might as well try to make the best of it. [rooster crowing] ANDREA: Dear mother, this is really some project you've assigned me to. I can't tell you how appreciative I am of the opportunity. Rustic spa it isn't. Rip off, it is. Bad enough, the walks take us over manure-ridden trails, but the worst part is that sleazy little cretin of a manager has attached himself to me like glue. No wonder. That brochure we got was fabricated from the farthest reaches of any of mind he may have had. His activities coordinator must have had a budget of less than $10 to work with. Teeter totters, Air Force calisthenics on the lawn. Why, I've been here three days, and I haven't even been offered a facial or a manicure. And that creep is always just one step behind me. I don't even want to talk about the evening fresh air chicken chases. [screaming] Oh. [light laughter] Come in. The water is fine. This is just great. Oh. This is gross. Wonderful. Hey, cowboy. What are you doing out here? Shouldn't you be watching this like a lifeguard? Well, I think you can all look after yourselves. Besides, it seems a few of you might have forgotten to bring your bathing suits. Like me? Miss, maybe you should go back with the others. I'd rather play with you. Wait. Cody! Jessie! Wait, damn it! Jess! This is heaven. You can forget all about your divorce, Estelle. Divorce? Arnold? I've forgotten all about him. (TOGETHER) Have you ever been married before, Lisa? No. Honey, you haven't missed nothing. Believe me. - Absolutely. So tell me about your man, Renee. Which one? This is better than any man I ever had. I'll say. All I need is a drink in this hand, and I'll be fine. Hey, Alice, did you know your kneecaps are rising? Estelle, these are not my knee caps. These are my boobs. Well, honey, my incidentals are no bigger than two lentils. Oh, my god. It's old faithful rising again. Here comes the bubbles. Ah-oh. Who had beans for lunch? Do you know what I mean about this mud being better than a man? Speaking of men, this mud is going to keep my naturally youth for live. You know something? I wonder if this is the fountain of youth. That's a good point. Alice, you know that freckle on your face? Yeah. This would make it look better. Oh, you. Don't you dare! Oh, you sister. Up your nose with a rubber hose. [laughter] Hey, Alice, you want a tan? Here's a tan. Oh, Estelle. You know something, Estelle, you'd look good on the "Titanic." Honey, I am the "Titanic." Here I go. This like the La Brea Tar Pits. Oh, do you know what? The saber-tooth tigers never died with a smile on their faces. Get me. I'm like a beached whale you trying to get me out of here. How about we get out now and have one of Ruby's 1,000 calorie meals. Yeah, I'm famished. OK, ever woman for herself. [laughing] Jessie growed up, and I never even noticed. I'm starved. Dr. [inaudible] should put this in his book. Oh, my goodness. Those beans. And there's steak. At last, we're having something like this. Wow. So hungry. CODY: Hi, Jessie. Well, Romeo, missed you at supper. I wasn't hungry. Ruby outdid herself tonight. Guess she is going to stop making that stuff Barry wants her to serve. Jessie, about this afternoon. Oh, sorry about that. I mean, walking in on you and all. Well, nothing happened. She's a wild girl who didn't mean a thing. You don't have to explain things to me. You're a big boy. She's an attractive woman, and I'm not your mother. Jessie. Valentino threw a shoe. Fix it. Oh, and tell Kathy not to make it a late night tonight. Trail ride is tomorrow. Jessie. Jessie. Well, afternoon, ladies. Seeing you're going to be using these horses, I figure y'all should learn to ride them. Now, you take Valentino here, why like most horses, he's a gentle animal. You learn to treat him right, he's going to treat you right. Does Valentino have a lot of girlfriends? She means do you use him for stud purposes. Valentino? No. We had high hopes, but well, he never had the right stuff. Why is that? Well, I guess a good stud is hard to find. Tell me about it. [giggling] I thought I'd lost you. Well, not to worry. I've been keeping a close eye on you. Has it ever occurred to you that I might be trying to get rid of you? You won't find any of these growing in New York. Don't pick. Look, Andrea, let's lay our cards on the table. Just exactly what problems do you have with the ranch? You mean besides the fact that you've misrepresented yourself by advertising professional staff? Your quote unquote, "dietitian" serves an average of 3,000 calories a meal to each guest. Yeah. And since you're the huckster that convinced these people to turn their ranch into a side show, in a nutshell, you're slime. OK. Besides that? Ruby. You're going to have to wait for lunch. I'm not running a deli here. Sure look mighty pretty, Miss Ruby. You don't look so bad yourself. Well, thank you. I brought your favorite bon bons. Now what are you doing so dressed up? Well, I was kind of wondering if you could see your way clear into accompanying me on a little walk. A walk? Of course, then we do have the house to ourselves all afternoon. Why you dirty old bag of flea-bitten, prairie dog. You get out of here. OK. On a scale of 1 to 10, what do you say? Do you really want me to answer that? Yes. Actually, in spite of the fact that your place is more like a dude ranch than an accredited health spa, they all seem to like it, and they're having the time of their lives. Ah, come on, Andrea, what do you say, thumbs up, thumbs down? I haven't decided yet. [screaming] Oh, I'm sorry. Here. Ups. Andrea! [screaming] I'm sorry. Yes, operator collect from Andrea Greenberg. Hi, Carol. Connect me with Audrey. Hi, Audrey, I got a great teaser for the dailies. OK. Health forum will feature an expose on bogus health retreats, most notably the Wild Rose Ranch near Calgary, Alberta. "The women are promised professional, physical, and emotional therapy under the shadow of the Rocky Mountains. The state-of-the-art facilities consist of a once-abandoned ranch with a fresh coat of paint, a dietitian who never attended grade school and thinks nitrates is what them New York perverts pay sleazy hotel clerks for hourly ron dayz vous." Their healing methods, I have to admit, are very relaxing. There's a few other things too. The strange thing is that every one of their paying customers loves it. (ALL) To the Wild Rose Ranch. There's not a complaint from any of them. Forget what I just said, OK? Dump all of it out. Run the file stuff. I want to do a little more research. Hey, Jessie, come on over here, darling. Hi, guys. Looking good tonight, Jess. Buy you a beer? Sure. Jenny, one more over here. Can I talk to you for a moment? Sure. I didn't know you were going with Cody. Of course, I should have guessed. Who says I am? The old man at the ranch. Dad? What? Cool it, cutie. I just wanted you to know that I didn't know and that nothing happened that day or since. He's a nice guy. JESSIE: Yeah, I know. Then what are you doing sitting here? Two beers, pal. Got it. [MUSIC - GARY FJELLGAARD, "PRIDE OF THE PRAIRIE"] She's the pride of the prairie, roll in the river. She's the mist on the mountain, the salt of the land. She's a cold January who woke up to light. She's the pride of the prairie, a true love of mine. She's the gold of our sun runs, the green of the cream. She's the red of a sunset. She's chained, but she's free. She's a glow on the fire and strawberry wine. She's the pride of the prairie, a true love of mine. She is all that I am dreaming. She's heaven above. She's a pride of the prairie, the woman I love. And I'll keep on loving till the end of my time. The pride of the prairie, a true love of mine. She's the pride of the prairie, a true love of mine. BARRY: Cody. Cody? Hey, Cody, you're on. SINGER: Come on, Cody. You haven't been up here for a while. [cheers] All right. OK, you asked for it. Well, this is one of my own songs, and it's a real special song to me. And I wrote it for a girl named Jessie. (ALL) Ah! [MUSIC - GARY FJELLGAARD, "DANCE WITH THIS OLD COWBOY"] He was leather and dust. He was bent and burst and just a worn-out, broken-down cowboy. He was rodeo, but that was years ago. Now the rodeo is over. And she was young and soft, and every hat came off in respect for hope and beauty. She was a dance hall prize in every young man's eyes and in the heart of that old cowboy. I wanna hold you close to me, he said. I wanna feel my arms around you. And if you don't mind my asking you, would you dance with those old cowboy? That cowboy fell in love, head over heals in love with that vision of a prairie. Would you dance with me? He so bravely asked her? His last dance just a memory. And though she's small of the smile, liked to melt his heart, she said you almost had me worried. I've been waiting all night. I thought you'd never ask me. I'm so glad you found the courage. I wanna hold you close to me, he said. I wanna feel my arms around you. And if you don't mind my asking you, would you dance with this old cowboy? I wanna hold you close to me, he said. I wanna feel my arms around you. And if you don't mind my asking you, would you dance with this old cowboy. Would you dance with this old cowboy? [cheering] All right. Yes. Thank you. That was beautiful. [cheering] Come on, Barry. Let's go back to the table. I need another drink. Oh, great. That's it. I'm finished. It's all over. I fail to see the humor in the situation. We got a gold mine here. If we lose the ranch, some other operator will just move in and start over. OK, granted, for a health spa, it's a little unorthodox. Kathy? Kathy? [MUSIC - ELDORADO, "NORTH OF 49"] Well, I never been to Nashville, Tennessee. But everyone is telling me if country music is what you want, it's where you want to be. You can hear it. You don't have to go that far. You can feel it. You don't need to be a star to play and listen to that northern country music. Yeah, dancing to northern country music. Well, it ain't only Texas cowboy's two step all night long. You don't need no Dixie drawl just to say what you feel in a song. Don't get me wrong, I think that what they're doing, they're fairly fine. We got magic of our own just north of the 49. That's for you, Cody, the Hop to You Drop Bronco Contest. You used to win that ever year, before you-- what you do? Well, I hurt my back, Clarence. But you know, I don't need that stuff anymore because I'm a business tycoon now. Come on, cowboy. I'm taking you home. And if plan on spending any more time with me, they'll be no more drinking. Sounds good. Prize money this year is $2,000. You can do it. $2,000? Come on, hotshot. You get thrown by one horse, and I'll be nursing a cripple for the rest of my life. You'd make a beautiful nurse. Get in. You can do it, Cody! You can win it! Hey, Donny, have you met my fiance here? I just said yes to a honeymoon. Sorry, Jenny. This fella is a no shape for a honeymoon. Estelle. I'm Alice. I'm Estelle. Is it true that twins have a special bond? (TOGETHER) I suppose. I wouldn't really know. Then why did the two of you come here together? Well, I just got a divorce. And I was feeling her pain. Yeah. You might say-- (TOGETHER) --we're having an identical crisis. [laughing] Gin. (TOGETHER) Again? Good evening, ladies. Bit of a late night tonight? Who the hell are you? Corporal Gordon, ma'am. RCMP. What's that? Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Oh. We're cops, ladies. We're going to have to ask to be allowed into the bunk house. Regulations. - The bunkhouse? - Sorry. This spa has not applied for a liquor license. We've had some complaints. Oh, I'm bringing in a few. Well, I can show you the bunkhouse. I've been trying to get a man in my room all week. Thanks. [laughter] Shut up! It's a raid. The cops are right behind me. Quick, give me the booze and grass. We've got to get it out of here. I just love men in uniforms. Here, honey. Yeah. RCMP, ladies. We'd like to speak to you. So is it true that you always get your man? I guess so. Yeah. I usually do too. - Ah! - Look, officer. She's fainting. She needs artificial insemination. She means mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. (TOGETHER) Quick. Lay her down. Come on, honey. You'll be fine. That's right. Rub her hands. Rub her feet. Close the window. She'll catch her death. Here, honey. Are you feeling better? Yes. much. Much. Thank you. Thank you, officer. Oh, no. What's the matter, boy? Feel a little sick? Oh, my god. Ms. Greenberg. Oh. DON: Barry. Barry? What! DON: We got a problem. Some damn fool figured the horses needed a party last night too. They're dead drunk. And I found these in the horse trough. And Ms. Greenberg's gone riding. On a drunken horse? Yep. On the ridge? That's the way she was heading. Come on. Whoa. What is wrong? What is wrong with you? Come on. Come on. Andrea! Come on. Come on. What is wrong with you? Whoa. Aw! Andrea? Andrea, where are you? [horse belches] Andrea! Andrea. Oh, thank god, you're all right. Look, don't say it. Don't say anything. You don't need to. Look, I am so ashamed of myself. I must have been insane to think I could start up a health spa. Barry, I think-- I'm giving their money back, most of it. We spent some of it. I've been thinking what we can-- We were desperate. Look, go ahead. What the hell. Write it up. God knows how many con games-- For God's sake shut up. I love this place. They love this place. Those women have been to every boring health spa imaginable. There's more to life than losing weight. This place supplies a happy medium. You mean, you liked your stay? Me? I was painted, mudded, and manured. What do you think? I'm sorry. I'm not important. Your paying customers are. Those five ladies down there are planning on coming back here every year. I've decided to showcase your ranch as spa of the season. Get out of town. You're a hell of a salesman, Shafferton. All right. Yes! I'm sorry. Come on. Let's get out of here. [MUSIC - GARY FJELLGAARD, ANDREW STEVENS, LARRY HERRICKS & THE CREW, "WILD ROSE CAMPFIRE SONG"] Ain't seen enough until I look at you now. How you gonna work if you don't know how. How you gonna tell an orange from a cow? Hey, look at you now. [inaudible],, take a look at your clothes. [inaudible] the old Wild Rose. [inaudible] with water and a hose. Hey, look at you now. Yee-haw. (ALL SINGING) Could you move it on down to the Wild Rose Ranch? Hey, look at you now. [yodelling] [cheering] - Bye, ladies. - Bye, sweetie. Thanks so much. Bye, Jessie. Bye, sweetie. We'll be up next summer. Bye-bye. Can I ride up front with you? We'll be back. Remember the Wild Rose. All right. - Ready to go? - Yeah. Sure. Come on. Keep up the riding lessons. Bye. Tell all your friends about us. Come on, Brandy. Come on. They sure look kind of sad to leave us, didn't they? Who wouldn't be? All the wild flowers and mountains? And the fresh, clean air. [coughing] Hi. Is Ruby around? She's inside. Ah, that's good. Crazy lady, that one. I just came out to-- Not to worry. We have the money. I know all about it. That's the problem. I'm sorry. God knows I tried to stop it, but they've reclassified the property. They what? You've made it into a commercial enterprise, and it looks like you're going to need an additional $1,800. You never told us this when we applied for the permit. Ah, you're right. I was remiss in that regard. You were remiss? Anyway, I've been instructed to inform you that the extra payment is also due tomorrow at 3:00. We can't. We don't have enough. Then you're going to lose this property. The government will take possession. You-- you wanted us to lose this property all along. I don't believe it. Why? Do you want to know why this makes me happy, huh? Do you? I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'm getting a little tired of you American types coming up here and buying up everything in sight, then ignoring the property taxes. This is a question of national sovereignty. Canada won't be pushed around. Canada won't be pushed around. Boy, that's catchy. Maybe the boss will suggest it for a national campaign. Yeah. Canada won't be pushed around. I love it. Isn't this about the time the Duke comes in and saves the day? Who? Never mind. How much did we get? All they offered was $1,500 for the Cadillac and the pick up, and I just didn't have the heart to sell. Well, it's not enough anyway. All the money is due at 3 o'clock at the courthouse. RUBY: Damn government folks. Always sticking it to the little people. Well, I tell you, I'm not budging. And if I ever find out who hid my shotgun, I ain't gonna make it easy on him. Take me now, Lord. JESSIE: We worked so hard. We're a success, and we just don't care. Cody? Where did he go? He just went outside. Let him deal with it in his own way, Jess. He's always been a loner. Deal with it? Oh, my god, the rodeo. The rodeo is today. He's trying for the grand prize money. Prize money? $2,000 for winning. We gotta stop him. Wait. Why do we have to stop him? It's a wild horse contest. If he gets thrown, he may never walk again. I'll buy him a wheelchair. What the hell are you doing? About the only thing I can do to help. Cody, you can't do it. You'll be thrown again. Jesse, I've got a chance to save the ranch, and it's our only hope. It's not worth it. If I don't try, I could never live with myself. Cody, you can't. Don't be a fool. You'll get yourself killed. Go get Don and Ruby quick. We've gotta stop Cody! Cody, I can't let you go through with this. Damn it, Jess, I'm OK, and I'm not going to get thrown. You haven't been in a contest for over six years. I've just got to do it. I can't let Cody do it, Ruby. I got to ride in his place. I was hoping you'd say that. Yeah, I'd win too, you know. I was the king in my day, the king. You still are. You still are. All right then it's settled. I'm riding, and I'm winning. Go get 'em, tiger. All right. I need a proper saddle, you know? Sturdy. Something that will take a lot of stress. Here tell, I keep them in that trailer right here. Ruby, let me outta here. You ain't riding nothing, old man. I'm seeing to that. Ruby? Let me out of here, damn it. Damn you, woman. Don't mind him, folks. He's just my husband, drunk again. Ruby, damned you, woman. Let me out. I'm riding. I am going to get you. Oh, yeah. Sure. Sure. All right. I'm a rider. You're not doing it, Cody. As much as it pains me to say it, I'm not letting you compete. I haven't got time for this. You're not getting past me. Get out. Ha yah! My girlfriend, Buffy, taught me this stuff. Cody. Cody. Cody. Is he all right? I didn't mean to hurt him. Thank you, Barry. You saved the day. And lost the ranch. Say Jessie, just how tough is this bucking bronco stuff anyway? This is crazy. I'm going to get myself killed. No, you won't. Ah, stop your whining. Now, grab that saddle, and come on with me. Look, New York, you can't be a wimp all your life. The Wild Rose Ranch is at stake here. Wait a minute. You don't really expect me to win this thing, do you? Yes, damn it, I do, and so should you. There's too much at stake not to. ANNOUNCER: Dude number 7. Cody Brewster, a cowboy. Launch over the bucket horse. Chestnut bucket horse. Very good. You can make you some money if you use them. You've got to stay in the front end. You've got to sprawl the horse-- Come on. ANNOUNCER: And with your free arm, clear yourself of the horse. You've got to make second rides. You can do it, Barry. Do it for us. Do it for the Wild Rose Ranch. ANNOUNCER: Look at that cowboy ride. Stay with him, Cody. Cody is not only going to make the record, he's out to break the horse. Whoa-hew. ANNOUNCER: And doggie. There goes one fine rider, Cody Brewster. Hey, Cody, come on down and collect your prize money, buddy. You earned it. Thank you. Come on. Jessie, Cody, I got it. Well, get the truck started. Come on. Time is running out. It's faster to ride across the field. Get going. Stanley. Doris. Stella. It's close enough. Let's say we close up, and I'll buy everybody all a beer you can drink at the Alcana. Gee, Norbert, thanks. Great. Don't you think we should wait until 3:00? Stella, nah. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You don't have the money. I know you don't have the money. I got it! I got it! [clock strikes 3:00] Nope. You're too late. We're closed. But I've got all the cash I need right here. You're finished. You defaulted. Chalk one up for Canada. You lost it. He hasn't lost a thing, you creep. Andrea? Howdy, cowboy. One tax bill signed, sealed, and paid in full. What's going on? You paid it? That's right. Even this hick town knows a good traveler's check when it sees one. Now, move over. Stanley! Stanley! Stella! Oh. Look, I'll pay you back. I promise. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it? What do you mean don't worry about it? I'd rather have the investment. You might never get any in return. We'll work something out. Besides, I've always been intrigued by real estate and it's fringe benefits. [theme music] DIRECTOR: Help her out now. Get out. Are we cut? DIRECTOR: Yes. Help her out. Out this way. [laughing] Well, let me buy the place back. I don't make much, but I got a little in the bank, and I can pay in installments. Hey, New York, you've got two minutes to move that skinny butt out of your-- Maybe she'll feel better after a hot shower. Oh, god. You did fix the hot water, didn't you? Nope. Should I have I? Should I have I? Oh, my god, the rodeo. The rodeo is today! (ALL) Oh, my god. The rodeo! The rodeo is today!
