(upbeat hip hop music) - Last summer, last summer was low, man. I mean, I can't think of no other way to describe it, except it was just straight up crazy, man. My mind still has trouble comprehending what all went down in like a three month period. - Last summer? Last summer was an emotional rollercoaster. My feelings felt like they were on a Pogo stick. Up, down, up, down, up, down - It all started back in June on the day my boy Scooter was about to begin serving his life sentence. It was his wedding day. I don't know what it is, man but something about weddings seemed to strike a chord in my girl, Yasmine. - I love weddings anyway, but Tymkia was getting married. I mean, that's my girl, we are like this. - Dearly beloved. We are gathered here today before God to join these young blacks together in holy matrimony. If there is anyone who feels these two should not be joined together may they speak now or forever hold their peace. I says, may they speak now. Ms. Johnson was a good woman. She never did nothing to nobody, but don't y'all feel sorry for her Saints because she's with the lord now. Would anybody like to come up and say a few words on her behalf? - This fool's ruining my wedding. - No, no, no baby. - Reverend, Ms. Johnson funeral was last week. - Say what? - This is a wedding, man. - I know what this is boy. We shall proceed. Tammy Kia. - That's Tymkia. - Whatever, do you take this brother to be your lawfully wedded husband? For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health for as long as you both shall live? - I do. (sobbing loudly) - Scoop hair Jones. - That's Scooter. - Whatever, do you take this sister to be your lawfully wedded wife for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health for long as you both shall stay black? - He does. - It's got to come out of his mouth. - I do. (sobbing loudly) - By the almighty power vested up in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may tongue your bride.

I wish it was us. - It is us, shorty. - I'm talking about the reception, the ceremony, the whole wedding thing. Kwame, we've been dating for two years now. Don't you think it's time we start making some wedding plans of our own? (coughing loudly) - My throat feels a little drizzy. I'm gonna go get a little something something to drink. Want something, champagne, wine, floatie? - No, I'm straight. - All right. Hey girl. - Hey. - We've been friends for a long time, I need to call in a huge favor. - What's that? - This whole bouquet toss thing?

It was sort of fake the way it just fell right in your hands. - I'm gonna put it in the house before one of them hood rats tries to take it away from me. A couple of them were looking at me kind of sideways after the bouquet happened to land in my hands. - All right shorty, will you get me a piece of that wedding cake while you're in there? - Okay baby. - Yo, check this out Kwame. Two former members of the Boogaloo posse. - Just 'cause I'm married, don't take my status away from me. Hey, I'm a member for life dog, a member for life. - Your is honorary. - Honorary my, look I'm still gonna be hanging with the homies. I even pushed back my honeymoon so I can play in that basketball game with y'all tomorrow. - I hear you talking, but you like Lance. See, before today we ain't even seen or heard from him in months. Talk to this boy Lance, tell him, talk to him. (mumbling incoherently) - Baby, accept it man. Your ripping and running days, like the million man march and Shaft, are black history baby. - Kwame you're talking all that trash, but you need to do what it takes to make Yasmine happy. 'Cause you ain't pulling them like you used to, bro. - I'm with my girl right now because I choose to be man. But anytime I wanted to get back in the game, I could. And would wreck shop like I used to, pulling the finest biddies on the East coast, West coast and the dirty south. My game is nationwide baby. - What game? - I think Scoot is right, Kwame. You know you've been with Yasmine for a minute, player. See these hoochies today, well all they're worried about is bills bills bills. Frankly your, is broke broke broke. - Allow me to tell y'all about the elephant and the mouse. One day they was just chilling, walking through the jungle and the elephant fell in the ditch. So the mouse said don't even trip man I'm gonna get you out. So he runs off and he comes back with a brand spanking new BMW, tells him to wrap his trunk around the bumper, revs up the engine, takes off and pulls him to safety. The elephant's grateful man. Two weeks later, they walking through the same jungle and the mouse falls in the ditch. So the elephant leans over the ditch and lets his hang in the ditch, tells him to grab on. The mouse does and he pulls them out to safety. - So the moral of the story is what? - Point being, when you have a big, you don't need no BMW. (all laughing) - I'm feeling that, I'm feeling that. (upbeat music) - There's your cake. - My man you gonna eat the rest of that? (laughing loudly) - I can pull them like I used to. - You're still the man you know. - Those look tasty, can I get a grape? I'll interpret that as a no. Look Yas, I know me acting really silly and stupid tonight embarrassed you. It shouldn't have happened. - What was that tack head anyway, are you fooling around with her? - No, last time I messed with girls was back when MC hammer had money and you know that was a long time ago. - Are you sexually attracted to her? Be honest with me, it's okay if you are, it's human nature. It only becomes a problem when you act on it. Tell the truth. - Well her booty is ghetto fabulous, you know what I mean? Not that I be looking, but from what I can remember, baby could clap her louder than most could clap their hands. Wait wait wait, baby I'm playing I'm playing. I'm just messing with you girl. She is too hoochie-fied to pique my interest sexually or intellectually. You're the only one for me girl, I love you. Nobody could ever take your place. So quit tripping. - I love you too Kwame with all my heart but you got to learn to be more sensitive and think about my feelings sometimes before you do some of the stuff you do. - Okay I'll concentrate on getting in touch with my feminine side. - I didn't say all that. That sounded too much like you going to be wearing my panties next week. - Come here, kiss me. - Wasn't Tymkia's wedding fat? - It was cool, if you like to see a brother walk down the aisle to the gas chamber. - Tymkia looked so beautiful. And she was so happy. I want my wedding to be just like that, but maybe in a church though. Kwame, when are we going to get married? - 2010. - Stop playing boy, I'm for reals. When are you going to pop the question? - Well, I can pop it tonight, but we still ain't getting married 'til 2010. That's the soonest I see myself getting out the game. - Getting out of what game? - You know, retire. Hang up the jersey, put the sneakers away. Metaphors baby, now come on back to bed so I can enjoy the ride. - No Kwame. - Okay, then you can enjoy the ride. I don't mind being on the bottoms. - I think it's time we discussed this. - Look, can we talk about this nonsense later? - That's all this is to you, is nonsense? - At this moment, hell yeah. Now come on back to bed. - I think you need to raise up and get to stepping 'cause I'm going to be sleeping by myself. - Oh hell no, you gonna get a brother all hot and horny then tell him you're going to be sleeping by yourself? What you trying to do, give blue balls? - Handle it. - Yas, don't front, you know you all hot and horny too. Let's just get a quickie, bang, bang, smack, smack, bang, go to sleep and talk about it in the morning. - I'm going to be okay. - A vibrator? What the hell is that for? - You don't know? And what part of step don't you comprehend? (snoring softly) - Kwame, wake up fool. You were supposed to be coming to pick me up so we can be at the courts by nine o'clock. - What time is it? - 9:30. - Why you didn't call and wake me up? - Look fool. - I'm gonna go hop in the shower man. - Man damn that, we ain't got time. Look, we gotta go right now, we gotta be out. - Man this couch whooped my, playboy. - Stop whining like a punk. You know what? You better be glad that she didn't make your sleep on the porch like a dog, you know what I'm saying? Hey, what'd you do anyway? - Man Yasmine starts squawking about this marriage thing. When we're gonna get married? Right before we's about to do the naked tango. - What? Yo, females be tripping you know what I'm saying? After they've been to a wedding, especially when it's one of their girls getting married. She might be nagging yo for months, maybe years. - Damn that. I allowed her to have a moment last night. She bring that again, it can get ugly up in this camp. I don't want to hear about it no more. We get married in 2010, 2015. And that's that. - Player player. - I'm the King of this castle. - Preach on brother. - There's only shack bully wearing the pants in this hiz-house. I'm running things in this crib. And you can quote me on that. - Is that right? - Hey baby I thought that you had, had already left for church. Did the alarm not go off? I'm just, I've been meaning to get that thing fixed. I got to get it, I'm gonna fix it, but you want some breakfast or something? I can make you something, some cream of wheat, grits, spamwich. - I heard your conversation, Kwame. - What conversation? - Don't punk out now, shack bully. - Yeah so check it-- - No Kwame, you check it. You have played me for the last time. All this talk about we getting married when you say we get married is dead and stinking. Newsflash king of the castle. We get married in 30 days or else. - Or else what? - Or else you can kiss the fattest part of my black 'cause love won't live here anymore. - Damn Kwame, you think she mad? - Scoot. Where the hell is your homeboys man? - Man, they'll be here just hold on, all right? - Hey, we ain't got all day. Either they're coming or they're not, so what's up? - Damn Mookie, I said they'd be here chill. - What's up Scoot, baby? Sorry about discarding you dog. - In case you forgot, I'm boarding a plane to Jamaica today for my honeymoon. I gotta be at the airport in a couple of hours. Now where the hell have y'all been? - Let's just call it domestic discourse dog. But chill, don't even trip. This ain't gonna take long. - It's late. - I know Mookie, but your mama was in the mood to barf up balls this morning so I had to let her get her gobble on before I left the rack. (all laughing) Shall I shoot for outs? - Yeah Kwame shoot for outs 'cause we bought to beat you like you stole something. - Mook, I done told you. The only person that beats me is your mama. And I wish the crusty would stop because my, is sore. - You know, since you so confident and arrogant, what do you say we raise the stakes? - What you want to do? - A G. - Oh man, I thought you was talking about some real money. What do you say we up the ante to 2G, you game? - Oh, hell yeah. It'd be like taking candy from a baby. - Not when that baby's a bad thug. - Show the money. - Mookie, you know we good for it. - No, no, no. We'll play for what you got on you right now. - All right then, hold up. Scoot. - What? - I need you to flash a couple of grand of your honeymoon money. - Kwame is you crazy? A couple of grand is my honeymoon money. - Come on, stop being a punk man. We ain't gonna lose this game. Look, when was the last time we lost on the blacktop anyway? - It's just for show, man. And if by some stretch of the imagination we lose, I'll go straight to the bank and get your money back. And if we win, when we win, Iggy and I get $600, you'll get eight. Come on man. - All right it sounds cool but I don't have time to go to the bank in case we lose, man. I'm already cutting it close as it is 'cause y'all was late. - Look man I'll wire you the duckets. It'll be there before you land. - I don't know man, Tymkia will kick my if I lose this money. - Tymkia Tymkia Tymkia man, what you got, one testicle? - I got two balls. - Well how big is your balls, this big? - All right, damn. (laughing) - Kwame, you really got 2G's if we lose this game right? - Nope. - That's jacked up, I'm proud of you man, I'm proud. - Yo, 15 by ones. Winner take out, gotta win by two. - I know the rules, punk. - Shoot for outs. - I'm like the spa baby, I'll be giving you facials all day. (upbeat hip hop music) (speaking over each other) (whooping quietly) (laughing) - We're done with these punks, so who's next, who's next? - I thought we weren't gonna lose, man. - What's this? - That's my itinerary so you know which hotel to wire the money to. - Scoot, baby, man. I sort of exaggerated about having all the money, but man I'll wire you what I got. - Well, how much you got? - Oh, I got about 15. - Oh what, $1,500? - No, $15. - Damn you promised me we wasn't gonna lose, man. - Yo man who knew we was gonna lose man? We never lost before. - Damn, damn man, what am I going to tell Tymkia, man? - Look dog, I got about four or five labels looking to sign my artist Chantal man. I'm feeling like I'm going to have a deal by the end of this week. - Well, that doesn't exactly help me today Kwame, now does it? - Yo man, yo can I borrow some money? - I can't help you Scooter. My rent's due this week man. - Iggy, you're with your mama. - You know that she be charging me $200 a month. If I don't pay, or even if I'm a day late, then I'm gonna be homeless. - Damn. - Scoot, you don't want the $15? - Well at least tell Tymkia that we say hi, all right? - [Tymika] You lost our honeymoon money on a stupid basketball game with your crusty homies? Oh hell no. - Baby please, come on. Baby please, no no. Come on now, damn baby.

(laughing) - What the hell? - What is it Kwame? I got a lot of work to do. - What's up with the packed boxes at the house? Is our lease up, are we moving? - Well, since it's been 23 days and you haven't reached a decision, I don't want to influence it either way so I'm going to go away for a little while and give you some space. - Okay okay all right Yasmine. This little ultimatum thing has gone on long enough. What do you want? - What do I want? - Excuse me, Yasmine. The meeting's in 20 minutes. - What is this about? A new dinette set, a sexy piece of lingerie, a shopping spree at the swap meet, what? - Dinette set? Lingerie? Shopping spree at the swap meet, you don't get it do you? You're right. This ultimatum thing has gone too far. Kwame, I don't want to be someone's girlfriend forever. I want to be a bride. Have a family, I deserve that. I just don't see that happening with us. - So what you saying? - [Coworker] Pardon me, the meeting's been moved to the conference room. - Thank you. Kwame, we seem to be headed in opposite directions. I think maybe it's best if we cut our losses and do our own thing. - So what, just like that it's over? Cool. You know, if that's what you want but don't come crawling back to me begging for no second chance 'cause I don't go there, the train don't back up. - I understand. I have a meeting to prepare for, I'll see you later. - Peace you know? Shoot, not like you'd be out gang banging or nothing like that. I just mean peace like you know, be cool. 'Cause I'm gonna be cool. - I truly believed he still loved me and God knows I was still cuckoo for Kwame. I mean he was all that and a bucket of spicy hot wings. Cute, charming, sexy. - With Yasmine gone, I can work on my music at the house to all hours of the night. The homies could kick it 'til the sun came up. That was cool for the first few nights. But after that, I can't front. I missed the hell out of that girl. Her touch, her smell, her smile. One night, I must've stayed up to the crack of dawn, not chilling with the homies, not making music, but just reminiscing. Looking at pictures, reading old letters and listening to old songs that had special meaning to it. - When I initially made the ultimatum, it was in anger. But the more I thought about it, the stronger I felt about it. I mean he had gotten complacent in our relationship, took me for granted, putting all his time and money into his music, contributed little or nothing to the household. I was practically taking care of him. Excuse my French but it was time for Kwame to either or get off the pot 'cause he had been constipated for much too long. - [Kwame] That's when I decided to seek advice from the fellows. - Marriage? Marriage is cool, man. It's the best decision I've ever made in life. Yo I think you ought to do it. It's time, it's time. - Oh hell no. Look, if you give in to this, she will be pimping you with ultimatums for the rest of your life. Take out the trash or I ain't going to give you none of this. - Marriage is a nightmare. Well, it starts off good but ask any married sucker after a few months what it's like he'll tell you it feels like living with the grim reaper and being held hostage up in hell. Nags me all the time, done ballooned up 14 sizes since the last time we've been together. Sweats a brother 24/7 Kwame. Hell I'd have more freedom up in the pen. - [Wife] You been out there way too long. Get your butt in the house. (mumbling incoherently) - I got to go but remember this, walking down that altar is like walking down the plank. If you ain't got a gun to your head, don't do it. Okay Kwame? Never get married. Coming, my queen. - My momma's collard greens with a ham hock in the middle for flavor. Ain't nothing like it boy, I tell you. - Kwame, I can't cook with you moving around in the kitchen. Go over there and sit down. - All right all right, but if you need anybody to sample something, say the greens or the corn bread, I'm your man. Oh mama, I seen uncle Coop today. What's been up? I heard you had a little brush with the law last week. - Yeah, I spent a few nights in jail. Got arrested for being a black man on a sunny day. And it was sunny so what you could do? So where's miss missy at? What's her name, Jasmine. - Yasmine. - Spasmin, Yasmine, whatever where's she at? - We're not together no more, Coop. - You're not together no more? Let me guess. Some pigeon head gal stumbled, fell on your, Rasman found out about it, no? Oh well she wants you to get married and you ain't ready. - Yeah, how you know? - Oh man your uncle Coop been in the love game a long time. It's written all over your face like stank on a bathroom wall. - So what you think I should do. - Well what you should do is do what you want to do, do how you feel, see? Now I know for me, I tried that six times and don't work for me. You understand what I'm saying? Worse than a damn job. Can't take a time off, can't call in sick. And the worst thing is, it don't go over well with the other. Stay single. Some hot sauce on it, it's good. - So what's going on with you and Yasmine? - She gone mama, she gone. - It's all right baby, tell mama why, what happened? - She said some junk about being tired of being a bridesmaid. So marry me or else. - Well see that's not junk to her, just like your music is not junk to you, you got to respect her feelings. I love you boy, but I'm not mad at the girl for looking out for her future. - I am, I mean, I was her future. - The older you get the harder it is to find that special somebody. I haven't found anybody since your father and I fell out 20 years ago. Well let's just say she waits three, five years for you. And then you don't marry her. I'm not saying for you to be pressured into doing anything you don't want to do, but this is a defining moment in your life. And it may end up being defined in two parts. Before the ultimatum and after the ultimatum. So you be sure that you can live with the consequences of your decision. - Damn pimping. I can't believe you got me waiting outside of a booty club to go on a blind date with a stripper. Don't it bother you dude that Cassandra is a hairdresser by day and a stripper by night? - No. - Kind of feel guilty dog, like I shouldn't be doing this. - What? She quit yo man. Look, we just out here trying to have a good time trying to take your mind off of that. It's just a date player. - Yeah yeah yeah yeah you right. What'd you say she looked like again? - I don't really know. - I thought you said she was fine. - I said that's what I heard. I also heard that, you know, the brothers, well they really just be like dating her one time because of the problem that she used to have. But it's cool. - What you talking about, man what problem? - Here she comes. - All right, let's go. Let's go. - Girl you are wearing my carpet out with all that pacing back and forth, look at you. - Please, them six crumb snatchers you got running around here wore this carpet out years ago. - I miss Kwame and I feel guilty as hell like I shouldn't be doing this. - Look, what you need to do is go out and have yourself some fun for real. And maybe you and little Junebug might develop a booty job for each other. - Little Junebug? - Yeah. - How little is he? (doorbell ringing) - What's up cous? - Which one of you high class hoochies is Yasmine? - So what do you like to do? (farting quietly) You like to dance? I like to dance. I like to go out to the club. (farting louder) And then afterwards, I want to get something to eat? So I think I'm getting hungry now. Maybe some breakfast food or something. Maybe like some pancakes, some eggs. (farting loudly) - I wanna get an advertisement secretary job so I can get my shop on like that girl. You've got a week's wardrobe in them bags and look. I got a damn sock. - Where's the other one? - I couldn't afford it. - Girl please, I shop when I'm depressed. You better lucky you have a BMW. - What? - Black man working. You're not waiting to exhale like some of us, okay? Is that Lance? - They are so trifling. Anyway, don't keep me in suspense, tell me. How was your date with tattoo? - He spent half the night talking and the other half trying to get in my panties. Yo yo baby, back that up so little Junebug can whack. - He got any money girl? - Hell no, I had to put in $2 so I could supersize my kid's meal. - What, why you get a kid's meal? - Because when we were at the drive through window, he made it clear that if I ordered anything over $5, I will have to give him some booty. I was hungry, but not that hungry. - I know that girl. - Hold up Yasmine, hold up I just want to rap to you. Two minutes. - You got one minute. - Well, I guess I better get right to the point since you cut my time all short. I want you back Yasmine. Baby what we had was special. I want us to recapture that and rekindle that magic. If you would just give me another chance. - Why? So you can cheat on me again with another white girl? - Baby that was a long time ago. I've matured since then. I'm a one woman, man. - I don't know Mookie. My mama always told me if barks like a dog, it's a dog. - You leaving me, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. It forced me to grow up and be a man about myself. - I'm glad something positive came out of my broken heart. - I want the same thing Yasmine. To settle down and raise a family. Now I've got the dollars. I've got the clothes. I've got the car and I've got the house. The only thing that's missing is you, Yasmine. - I don't think so Mookie. - It's Kwame huh? You are going to waste your whole life waiting for Kwame because he is not going to marry you. His mentality is, why pay for the cow when I can get the milk for free. I don't know why you want to marry that brother anyway, the brother is a scrub. If you didn't pay his bills, he'd be at home living with his mom. That's appealing to you? - One minute is up. - Well you know the number boo, when you want the company of a real man. - Yas, does Mookie still have that Porsche? What's that? He drives a Porsche and he's romantic? Mookie kind of got it going on. You might want to reconsider giving that brother another chance. - This isn't from Mookie. - Look who it is madam. - Hi, it's good to see you. - It's good to see you too, you look beautiful. - Thank you, you look very handsome yourself. - It's just a little something I picked up back at the dumpster. - So what is it you brought me here to talk about that requires me to dress to impress? - Well, I just thought we'd have a little dinner. Discuss important issues. Inflation, why gangsters don't dance, they boogy, us. - I would like that. - That's not all. Mac and chizzies. - You made me mac and cheese boy? You know that's my favorite. I know you're trying to break a sister off with more than that, that ain't even gonna take the edge off. - My bad my bad my bad, dang. (moaning) - Damn baby, slow down. Ain't nobody going to take it from you, I promise. - What's that? - What? - That. Oh how cute. - Yas, you are the most beautifulest and intelligent woman I know. You mean the world to me and I don't ever want to lose you. I will never ever meet another woman like you. You are the woman of my dreams. Yasmine Denise Brooks, I want you to be my wife.

But I got some Isley Brothers in the truck if you want to buy that. - I think I can handle it. - I'm gonna hook you up but I got to warn you. These beats are off the funk richter scale.

He said somehow, the tape that I produced came across his desk and he wants me in his office tomorrow. - That's great baby, congratulations. - This calls for a celebration. Let's go in the room and play wrestlers so I can put the smack down. - And we can get to that after this diva soaks you from head to toe. - Baby whoa whoa that was an accident. I didn't mean to get you all wet, besides you look good. All right maybe you don't look exactly good, and your hair is nappy and your face is all smeared up to be damned. But that ain't no reason for no spray down. Yasmine, this black on black crime has got to stop. Put the gun down. Damn. (Kwame screaming playfully) - Tell Mr. B Love that the soundtrack will be completed in the next few weeks and will not hold up the release of the film. - Mr. Jackson, I'm sorry. I didn't realize in the parking lot-- - Save your breath kid. That's the script to B Love's new movie. He's a hot new filmmaker. Produce and write a song for page 47, scene 21. Use the female artist featured in your demo. You have two weeks to submit it to me. If I like it, we talk contracts. If not, no luck. Any questions? - No sir. - Good, now get the hell out of here. (all cooing softly) - Kwame gonna like that. (laughing loudly) - I'm laid all out and you laughing? I'm taking my black home, I'm tired. - Kwame, you play basketball for hours. We've been here all of 10 minutes and you're tired? That must've been a hell of a bachelor party you had last night. I'm sure you had four or five naked skanks running around. - No baby, it was civilized. Just a bunch of fellas chilling, playing dominoes. What are you asking some like that for anyway? What, you got a guilty conscience? What y'all have some male Chippendales dancers at the party? - Please, it was just the girls sitting around playing bid wiz. Hey isn't that Lance? Damn, she be pimping him. - [Cooper] Worse than a damn job, can't take a time off. Can't call in sick. - [Iggy] She will be pimping you with ultimatums for the rest of your life. - Look at you, about to be a husband. And you still need your-- - Mama. - Please, I used to wipe your butt, quit tripping. - [Reverend] Places everyone, showtime's in 10 minutes. - Congratulations, son. - I want you to remember one thing. When that reverend tells you, you may kiss the bride, I want you to do it like a man. I want you to grab that, that-- - Yasmine? - That Scrasmine. - Yasmine. - Whatever. I want you to grab that Scrasmine, I want you to slobber up and down, I want you to stick your tongue so far down her throat you touch her tonsils. She can feel that way down here. Way down here, you understand? See that way, you get control of the marriage right from the get go. From the beginning, right down here to the end, you got control here here here. Stay strong little one. Give me some love. (yelling) - Honey you look more beautiful as a bride than I did 27 years ago. - She also 200 pound lighter than you were then too. That's a fact. - Okay okay, I hate to cut this sentimental moment short, but it's time to get started. - Love you. - You look so beautiful. - May god strike you dead before you say I do. - Thanks for your support. - Don't mention it. - All right, you ready to do this dog? - I don't know dog. - What do you mean you don't know man? Half of Yasmine's family flown in from Chinatown and you talking about, you don't know? Come on. - My bad, my bad man. I'm just, the butterflies got me tripping, man. Let's do this. - Let's do it. Yeah, come on baby let's do it. Come on man. (knocking) - Who is it? - [Kwame] It's Kwame. - Kwame, what are you doing here? Now you know you're not supposed to see the bride before the wedding. - I need to speak to Yasmine. - [Tymika] Kwame. - [Yasmine] It's okay girl, we'll talk through the door. - All right but if y'all have bad luck, don't say I didn't try to prevent that. - Can't believe we're finally getting married, aren't you excited? - Yeah? - Well what is it Kwame that it couldn't wait until after the wedding? - I just wanted to say that I love you, Yasmine Denise Brooks, one more time. - I love you too. (guests chatting quietly) - Let's do this baby. Come on man, it's showtime. "Yas, I can't do it, please forgive me, Kwame." Damn. - You see what had happened was, the timing wasn't right. I mean, I ain't no astrologer or nothing, but the stars wasn't aligned properly on that day. You dig? ♪ Is there a key to my heart ♪ ♪ Everyday ♪ ♪ We see people that we might wanna envy ♪ ♪ Many dreams drown in an empty sea ♪ - Okay, okay I deserved that. I know what I did was wrong and I'm sorry. Say something. - What do you want Kwame? - Excuse me? - Why are you here? - Because I love you, I miss you. - Save it all right? - Look Yas, I want us to be together. But marriage is a giant step right now, a step that I'm just not ready to take. So how come we can't go back to kicking it like we used to with you being my woman and me being your man? - I can't believe you could even come up in here and say something like that after what you did. - I know what went down was wrong, I messed up. - Messed up? No, what you did was, up. You hurt me Kwame. - I'm sorry Yas-- - What was supposed to be happiest day of my life turned out to be the most humiliating and embarrassing. And your trifling didn't even have the balls to tell me to my face like a man. - Baby I blew it, okay? I messed up big time. My actions were those of a punk coward. - I don't want to hear this. Your whole program is tired. - I'm sorry Yasmine. - Yes you are, you're one sorry. - I bet he trifling too. - It's going to take some time and a lot of hard work, but we can overcome this baby, I know we can. - Let me break it down for you. There is no we. It's over, kaput, done, finished, finito, comprende? I have outgrown you and this whole situation. - So what I mean, what you're, you're not trying to talk about this? - No. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm in the middle of moving. - Look, Yasmine-- - Bye. (TV blaring) - Oh, snap. Confirmation to the Kwame site, brother is back in town. - I didn't hear a knock at the door nor me saying come in. - It's probably cause you didn't say it fool. Damn home boy, looks like you've been burglarized or something up in here. - What you doing? - My hands is clean. Yo you missed it. Yasmine left the church on y'all's wedding day, she flipped out. Scooping up your gear so quick. Make your head spin worse than the exorcist. - Is those my boots? - Oh look at the time. I got to get out of here now and finish delivering yesterday's mail. You know what I'm saying, all right peace. Mookie and them challenged us to another basketball game tomorrow. 11 o'clock for two grand. You trying to be down or what? - Man where are we going to get that kind of money? - Look, we ain't never lost two games in a row. The fools can't beat us again. You just had an off day. - Man I know that but I'm saying, Mookie like you to show the skrilla up front. - Player player player, I got it covered, baby, covered. - Is that somebody's money out the mail? - Look, we be telling these fools all the time, do not send cash in the mail. It got a tendency to get lost. So you're trying to be down or what? - I'll be there. - [Iggy] Can you really try to be there? - Damn man I said I'll be there. - All right but you better not be late either. - Fellas fellas, it's 11:45 man. Might as well forfeit and come out of pocket. Come on, come on. Don't make this any harder than it needs to be, let's do this. Come on Iggy. That's what I'm talking about. - [TV Host] On the next Terry Ringer Show, transvestites and midgets who live alone. - Hey mama, how you doing? - Oh I'm fine, question is how are you? - Oh, I'm cool. I mean, I've had better days but you know. - I spoke to Iggy, he said you stood him and Scooter up today. - I forgot. - Kwame I raised a stronger man than this. You can't run from fear. You have to face it head on. You can't sit around here wallowing in self pity. - Me and my TV is having a good day. Don't rock our world, Mama, we is comfortable. - Well, you need to come out of your comfort zone. 'Cause right now you're acting like a punk. You act like you lost your best friend. - I did mama. Yasmine quit me, I missed the deadline to submit my tape to Sky High Records. Everything is jacked up right now. - So the chips are down right now. But you let your obstacles be a detour, not a derailment. If you want to be a producer, then you get up and you produce. If you want Yasmine back, go win the woman back or get over it because nothing's going to happen as long as you sit on your and watch that Terry Ringer show. Kwame, it is time for you to grow up and be a man. - Mr. Jackson. - Don't be running up on me like that boy, unless you trying to get cold cut. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you or nothing. - This is the executive floor, how the hell did you get up here? - I slipped your secretary my last fifty. - Give me security please. - Mr. Jackson, please, please just give me 30 seconds of your time. - What do you want boy? I'm about to have an important meeting. - I know I missed the deadline to submit my songs for the movie, but if I can get it to you within the next couple of weeks, is there any way that you would even consider it? - I'm submitting the package of songs tomorrow to the executive producer of the soundtrack, Mr. B Love himself who's going to choose the songs he likes for the film. - Mr. Jackson, please, I've had some really rocky times. Me and the missus to be fell out. - Get it on my desk by tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. If I like it, I'll submit it with the package just because I like your work. But if it arrives at nine oh one, it's too late. Now, get out. - Thanks Mr. Jackson. - Can I come in? - Oh yeah yeah yeah, come on in Chantal. Yo, I appreciate you coming over here on such short notice. - Oh, no problem you know I'd drive the world for you, but I mean you okay? I heard about your disappearance. - Yeah I was just on a DL for a minute building those mind muscles, but I'm cool thanks for asking. - No problem. - Yeah, so yeah, let's just jump right into this and let's just do it. ♪ Why can't it be a little easier ♪ ♪ Some days I laugh ♪ ♪ Some days I cry ♪ ♪ The tears won't dry ♪ (clapping loudly) - Yeah, yeah, that was tight. Girl, you got sick with it, that's what I'm talking about. - Only 'cause I had a dope producer to bring it out of me. What was that for? - Thank you. ♪ Ever since we were kids the love we had was real ♪ ♪ Everything that we did we let each other know the deal ♪ ♪ Even when we would walk to school ♪ ♪ We had each other's back ♪ ♪ We were inseparable ♪ ♪ The strength that we would lack ♪ ♪ On that day when they called ♪ ♪ And let me know the drill ♪ ♪ I began to cry tears for you ♪ ♪ And even though we time we shared ♪ ♪ Was the time that I will miss ♪ - Whoa whoa whoa hold up, hold up. - What's the matter, that didn't feel good? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It felt real good, it felt incredible. But I mean, I just can't do this you know? Nothing to do with you 'cause you got it going on three or four times over with the law loud. It's just me. - It's you or Yasmine? - I love that woman. That's what my heart is and that's where I belong. - I can respect that Kwame, but I mean if you ever change your mind, I mean. Friends? - For sure. - All right. - Yo, I'll let you know what the haps is when I hear from Sky High. Damn. (snoring) (phone ringing) Who this? Yeah yeah yeah that's cool. Thanks Mr. Jackson, okay, all right I'll see you then. Yes. - So then I just got real ugly with that trick. You know what I'm saying? I told her, look, if we are in the night, then you going to have to regurgitate all I just bought you and I mean everything. I'm talking about the fries, the hamburger, the shake, all of that. She said, I can't do that what are you talking about? I say, the hell you can't. Then I slipped three or four x-lax up in her b pod. - No. - She gonna be, 'til Tuesday kid. - Yo fellas man, hold up, hold up. I want to apologize for missing that game the other day dog, I feel responsible that y'all lost that money. So I set up another game with Mookie and them tomorrow for 10 G. - Now where are we supposed to get that kind of money from? - Hey, hey, hey, I can go through the mail like I usually do, you know what I'm saying? See what I come up with. - Sky High Records optioned one of my songs for five grand. And I put up all my music equipment to represent the rest. - Kwame, you can't do that, man. Your equipment is worth way more than that. - I know, man but that's all that Mook would give me for it. - Cool man, cool we'll be there. - No, no, no, no, no I can't let you do that Kwame. We know that music is the most important thing to you. Next to Yasmine, that's the most important thing in the world to you. - Yeah man but it's on me that y'all lost y'all money dog. It's time I stood up and started taking responsibility for my own man. You got a wife and a house Scoot. I still never really made it up to you for y'all's honeymoon. You need your money. - Yo and I need my money, you know what I'm saying? All of them hoochies and hood rats. - Yo, what time? - Nine o'clock. - It's on. - Yeah. - Hey yo Scoot though, man. I need a place to crash for a few days, man. A brother done been evicted. - No problem bro I got you, but I gotta warn you man. Yasmine staying at the house while she's waiting on her new place to get ready. - How are you doing ladies? How you doing Yasmine? - Fine, thank you. - I guess you heard I'm gonna be sleeping on the couch for a few days since you took Scooter's last vacant guest room. I was going to see if you wanted to kick it tonight. Maybe rent some movies or something but it looks like you getting ready to go somewhere. - I got plans. - That's cool. I got these for you. Hey Yasmine, you little chocolate wonder. I'll set it on the bed. - Congratulations. I heard about Sky High Records optioning one of your songs. I'm happy for you. - Thanks shorty. Yasmine. - Girl I feel terrible, like I shouldn't be doing this. - Think about how terrible you felt being stood up at the altar. Kwame. - And I told Scooter, you got here first. Kwame needs to go stay with his mom. - She's in a hotel. Her house is being painted. - Whatever. - I'm so nervous. - Look, it's not like you don't know the man. Just be yourself and order the most expensive thing on the menu. - What kind of perfume should I wear? - Well, I read in Sister Girl magazine, that the best perfume for a woman to wear is her own natural juices. - Juices? How many long Island iced teas had you had that day? - None girl. - See right here, here it is in black and white. Though men often joke about the smell of the vaginal area and its juices, it actually turns men on and reminds them of a romantic interlude. If a woman wants to dab her own natural juices on her neck and behind her ears, it is sure to drive a man crazy. I'm gonna try it. - You and this magazine is trifling. (doorbell ringing) - I guess I'll get the door. - What's up Kwame? - The game ain't 'til tomorrow, bro. And even then, you don't need to be trying to break a brother off with roses. 'Cause I don't get down like that. - I didn't come here to see you, man. I came here to pick up my date. - You with my boy's wife Tymkia? Man I will whoop your. - [Yasmine] He's here to pick me up. - Hey snuggles, you look beautiful. - You look very handsome yourself. - Thank you. - Snuggles. - Is that a tailor made Italian cut suit? - Why yes it is. - Now remember, order the most expensive thing on the menu and bring me back a plate of whatever you get. Although I kinda got a taste for chicken. - I'm not bringing you no plate girl, that is so ghetto. - Come on Yas, you know black folks do it all the time. - I kind of got a taste for some big pig feet. - Yas we gotta get going, baby. Our reservations at the Chanderelle are in 30 minutes. - Yas, can I holler at you quick minute over here? - No Kwame, we're late for our reservation. - It'll only take a second. - Bye bye. - Hey don't forget my plate girl. - Tymkia, what the hell was that all about? - I'm just trying to get my eat on, I'm hungry. - I'm talking about Yasmine and Mookie. - Well, to be honest, Kwame, if I was her I would do the same thing. I lost a gang of respect for you when you stood my girl up at the altar. When I heard you was back in town, I wanted to cut you. Scooter wouldn't let me. He saved your life, black. - I know I screwed up all right? - You can't blame her for getting on with her life. You made it perfectly clear that you didn't want to be with her. So now she's going to find somebody who does. Oh, if you could please tell old girl to leave my plate on the table. Kwam, you like my new perfume? - Girl you smell like a dead fish. - See, that's why you all by yourself tonight. (soft upbeat music) - Bye Mookie, I had a good time. I'll see you later boo. Kwame, what are you still doing up? - Watching TV. - Okay, good night. - Where have you been? - Excuse me? - You need to wipe that joker smile off your face. 'Cause ain't nobody making jokes. Where have you been? - Nonya, as in none of your business. - Ain't nobody playing with you Yasmine. - And I'm not playing with you either Kwame Getman. - You come walking in here at dawn with the sun hitting you in the crack of your talking about none of my business, ain't cool. - On the real Kwame, you need to get some business and stay out of mine. - Was he playing with my kitty cat? - What? - Did I stutter? - First of all, it's not your kitty cat, it's mine. Second, let's not go there son 'cause you might get your feelings hurt. Now I'm going to bed 'cause you getting on my nerves. - I'm not done talking to you, don't walk away from me girl. - Hey I just came to wish you good luck. - Thanks Chantal. - Girl you gonna hook me up with some of that punani, right? Well how about, can I just smell it? - Yo, let's do this. Come on. (players shouting) - That's what I'm talking about. - Now that was a killer crossover dog but you don't know nothing about that. You know, my game is as smooth as butter, boy. Six nothing. - Mookie. - That's what I told Yasmine last night. And not only did she do it, she loved it. She tossed my salad too, boy. (talking over each other) - You take JD, I got Mookie. No no no Kwame, come on. Yo man. You gotta get this Yasmine your mind man, just for a minute. Yo, she still loves you man but she's so hurt by what you did that she's trying to hurt you back. You need the weather the storm brother. Weather the storm and she'll be back, you feel me? All right, let's get our hoops on. Let's do this. (shouting over each other) (cheering) (cheering loudly) - You really mean what you said about Yasmine coming back to me, man? I mean, did Tymkia tell you that? - Tymkia didn't tell me that, that's just what my gut says, man. Look, the sooner that you put this Mookie thing outta your mind, the sooner man that y'all get back together. But as long as she thinks she's got your guard, as long as she thinks that is as long as she's going to run the table on you man. Good game, good game. (whooping loudly) - You the man. - I gotta go handle something real quick. (cheering) Can I holler at you for a minute? - What's up? - I just want to apologize for the way I've been acting lately. You know, what you do is your business. You know, if Mookie makes you happy, then I'm happy. We're just going to kick back in the cut and let you do your own thing. - Excuse me, come again? - I did not stutter or stammer girl. I'm happy to see you moving on with your life. And I'm realizing that it's time for me to do the same. - I see. - Homies? - Yeah. - So we about to go get something to eat, you wanna roll? - Thank you but no, Mookie and I are going to brunch. You played great out there. I'm just sorry it was at the expense of my man. - Oh, he's your man now? - Sort of. - Well that's cool, that's cool. You know, like I said, your happiness is what's important. - I better go. - Yeah yeah yeah. You don't want to keep the Mookster waiting or nothing like that.

I knew that I should never been talking to no barber. You know what I'm saying? Yo player, you're taking this stuff with Yasmine and Mookie pretty cool. - Man I just know our break up's a temporary situation. - Kwame, I need to talk to you. - Girl, can't you see I'm trying to get my grub on? - Party people hold up, I got an announcement. What started off as a barbecue has now turned into an engagement party. My mans right here, Mookie Jenkins will wed the lovely Yasmine Brooks next week. And everybody's invited. So DJ, play a song for the mister and missus to be. (guests clapping) - Congratulations. - Kwame wait. - We gotta dance baby, this song's for us. - Can I come in? - Sure. - Where are you going? - I got me a little spot in old town. - You don't have to go. - I was leaving anyway even before the big announcement. Just hadn't had a chance to tell you. - You were? - Yeah you know after the basketball game and Sky High Records breaking me off, I'm cool on dough so I'm gonna skedaddle. - Can I have a hug? ♪ How can I be sure the way I feel ♪ ♪ If you say that you don't know how I feel ♪ - Thanks Yasmine for teaching me about life, living, myself, and how to love somebody. Be good to yourself shorty. - I'm gonna miss you Kwame. (wedding bells ringing) - Oh you look beautiful Yasmine. - Thanks girl. - I remember when I was in your position just a few short months ago and, now it's finally your turn. - Who knew how much drama it would take to get here? - Oh, it was the best day of my life and I hope it's all that and a bucket of pigs feet for you too, boo. - Tymkia, you have always looked out for me and no matter what, you have always had my best interest in mind. I love you for that. - Oh, I love you too girl. - Kwame, I'm surprised to see you here, man. - You know, Yasmine and I've been friends for a long time. So I had to come and represent. - I'm sorry man, that this is going down. How you holding up, you cool? - All right. - Well keep your head up. - I'm glad you could make it Kwame. And look, I just wanted to thank you brother for keeping the cobwebs out of Yasmin's coochie while she and I were on hiatus all right? (laughing) - Mommy, daddy. - Hey baby. - Now we know we only have 10 minutes. So I'll make this brief. Sweetie, destiny has been good to you. I do believe Mookie is the one for you. Y'all going to have a beautiful life together and just remember anything you need, anything you want, you just know that your mom and daddy have your love and support. - Yeah baby girl. - Thanks mommy and daddy. - You know that lowdown trifling ex boyfriend had the nerve to show up here today. - Kwame's here? - Yes he's here and I don't know who in the hell invited him. - I did mommy, we're still friends. - Oh honey, you're more of a woman than I am. 'Cause every time I saw his black, I throw rocks at him. Standing my baby girl up at the altar? The girl I gave life to? What the hell is wrong with him anyway? - Your mother's not the only one upset with his presence. I don't know if I can restrain myself. 'Cause I might just snap and give him the old fashioned beat down. - Please, your little butt ain't big as a minute. You couldn't even kick your own. - I can whoop your, that much I do know. - Mom, Dad, please. - Now see there, you upset Yasmine on her wedding day. Look baby, I apologize for him. Now I'll see you outside as Mrs. Jenkins. - Yas, your face lit up like a Christmas tree when you heard Kwame's name. Are you sure you're doing the right thing? - Yes, this is something I have to do. - No, the only thing you have to do is stay black and die. - A woman only gets so many proposals. One has to seize the moment. This could be the last ship leaving the harbor. - This may be the last boat, but it may be the wrong boat. Ask our ancestors about that. - What's up dog? Cassandra and me, we decided to get back together. Try to work things out, you know what I'm saying? I finally realized you know that she the only one for me. You all right? (wedding march playing) - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to baptize this brother and sister in the name of the... We are gathered here today to join these two in holy matrimony. If there is anyone who feels these two should not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. Mookie Jenkins, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife to have and to hold from this day forward for as long as you both shall live? - I do. - Yasmine Brooks, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband to have and to hold from this day forward, for as long as you both shall live? - Yasmine, would you be my wife? - Would you marry me Yasmine? - What the hell are you doing? - Shorty, I love you, I am miserable without you. I can't even think half the time. You are the most beautiful woman on the planet. Yas, say that you will be my wife today, right here, right now. I want you, I want you and I need you in my life for richer or broker in sickness and in health 'til death do us part, Yas please. - Yes Kwame, yes. - Yasmine, baby. I got the cash, I got the car, I got the house. What could this fool possibly have that I ain't got? - My heart. - Please man. - Yasmine, I love you. - I'm sorry, Mookie but I don't love you. I love Kwame. - Look is anybody getting married? 'Cause I got to be at a funeral for a damned dog in 20 minutes. - Yeah yeah yeah right here homey. - Dearly beloved, we are now gathered here today to unite Kwame Getman and Yasmine Brooks in holy matrimony.

Kwame, you may kiss the bride. (guests applauding) - [Yasmine] Love you boo. - [Kwame] I love you too Yas.
