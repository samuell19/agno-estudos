- Damn it's freezing. - Yeah, it's a bit cold. - Do I look okay? - Yeah. - So my hair is fine then? - Ben, it's fine. - Well, it's important you know. - Your hair? - I know it's, not my hair, your hair, too, man. Your clothes, everything, we gotta make a good impression. Hold on, let me have a look at you. It's my own fault. I should have done this before we left home. - Done what? - Examine you. - You don't normally examine me. - Jacket off. - Ah, come on. - You're wearing the same shirt as me. - What, it looks good. - On me, and now you're wearing it too, man. Why? - I don't think it mad we dress similar. - So what is it gonna look like when we get to see this woman tonight? Don't you think it's gonna look a bit stupid? - I think we should be thinking about other things. - In fact, you didn't even do this when we go out for auditions. - Do what, get dressed? - Like me. - You dress well. - I still think it's a bit silly, you know. We're gonna be late. (doorbell ringing) - Hello? - Hello. - Who is it? - Hi, we're friends of Larry's. - Oh, come in boys. - You okay, you sure? - Hello boys. I'm just going to ask this once and then we are going to play. What are your names? - Ben. - Adam. - Do I have a shy one here? - Yeah. - And one that speaks when he isn't spoken to. You two are my sons. I catch you doing some of mommy's powders and she is very angry. But we have some time before daddy comes home and you are going to have to make it up to her. - So, do you have some sort of a safety word? - Whatever for? The only reason we may have to stop is if daddy comes home. I'll be back in a minute. Help yourselves boys. - Ah, what are you doing? You are very naughty boys. I think you're going to have to be punished, both of you. Don't you want to make mommy happy? - Daddy's, daddy's coming home. - Isn't mommy good enough for you? - Adam! Adam! Adam, come here, man. What the hell? - Hi. - Name, age and height, please. - It's Benjamin Spanner, 27 years old, 177 centimeters or 5'9 and a half actually. - This guy reminds me of the previous one. - We need to find somebody else. - If it helps, a man like me keep my whites whitest. - Maybe we should get him to try a different delivery. - This time could you put more emphasis on the A in man? - Even helps a man like me keep my whites whitest. - How about a little pause between whites and whitest? - Ben. Hi. Sorry, I'm late. I didn't see him outside and I thought I missed auditions, so I just, hi Ben. - Hi. - Yeah. So I thought come and see if you were still here. I'll just wait? - Don't bother. - Sorry, I'll start again shall I? - No, that's okay. We've got enough. So how many we got left? - Okay, thanks. - 12 I think. - Mate, I'm so sorry. - You should be. Fuck, I nearly had them. What happened to you last night anyway? That cost us a lot of money, you know. - It was only a washing up advert. - First, it's a washing up advert. Then get recognized with national auditions and add with a celebrity, mix in some hard work and fuck, you're famous. - Sorry. - I can't even get fucking started. - Drinks, I'll pay. - I'm seeing Gary, you're ringing. - It's Larry about last night I think. - I won't be just to say hello. - I don't think you're listening to me, Ben. - I'm sorry, but their breasts, they're better than yours and I'm more worried about my lack of career than anything else. And you should be, too. - We're doing fine. We can go out and buy stuff and do our own stuff on our own time. - Hey, happy Friday gentlemen, how you doing, all right? What can I get you lovely man whores this evening, then? - Thanks for that Gary. You sure you want to tell you mum, too? I might be able to get up some business on the road. - Ooh, is it his time of the month? - Bad audition. - And I'm a male prostitute. - Dream then. I'll get them. Same again. Cheers. So is there anything you want me to say to cheer you up? - No. - Come on, man, if you're gonna be like this all night, I'm going home. - Just don't know what else to do, man. I go for auditions and get fuck off. Nobody wants to read my script. - But you want to be an actor, right? This is what you've got to suffer through. Apart from being a rent boy, of course, that's all you. - Pay is decent and it gives me free time to do my shit. - It could give you lots of free time to work if you get arrested or raped. Puts you in a cracking mood for a Friday night, cheers. So what's new with you? - Not much. I started painting. - Interesting. - Do you think it's worth me doing this? - I think the acting, it's just an advert, man. You're good. This is right. We'll both make it. - Hey, do you even want to be an actor, huh? Listen let's go home, I want to see Gina. - Gina's at home? - Yeah. I gave her a key. - Since when do you even like her that much? - I always have. - Bullshit, why'd you give her a key? - She's my girlfriend. - Yeah, along with. - Ah. - Why'd you give her a key? - Why not? - Ben. - Don't be a morning bitch. (moaning) - Getting shit faced every time you have a bad audition isn't gonna solve anything. It's just gonna keep you in that shit job packing books and DVDs. - I just want a hug. - You're pathetic really, aren't you? (horn blowing) - You never spend any time with me. - Well, I went out because I needed a drink, okay? - You have to get a proper job. - I'm fucking trying here. Yesterday, yes, I know, we were wrong, I give you that, but something will come up soon, something big. I can feel it, but if you don't trust me Gina, I don't know. - Why are you still living with this loser and can't commit to move in with me. - You leave Adam out of this. - I'm not sure if I can live with you if you're gonna be this ridiculous. - Well, you know I want to do this. You know about it. - Seriously? - Yeah. - What would you even do if I moved out? I don't even think you'd care, would you? - Of course I care about us. If you cared about us. - You can't go on like this. You have to find some direction, you have to get him out. I can't handle this. - I told you to leave him out of the situation. - It's just the constantly having somewhere there. We cannot have our own relationship, nothing. - Why not? We have our own room, what the fuck? - Because he's just there all the time. - Just leave him out of this. - Well, come on, it's not just him is it? It's you, you've got to get a new job. You've got to sort yourself out. - You know what I want to do. You know that. - Packing DVDs, oh, that's a great career, isn't it? - Fuck you! - Sorry, excuse me. You go ahead and swallow that first, I'm Jody Birney, nice to meet you. I don't know if you've heard of me. - Uh, no, sorry. - That's okay, I thought I'd ask. I write for that paper. - All right. - Um, can I ask you a few questions? I'm trying to write this thing. - What? - Sorry, this thing on how actors struggle, how close they come to making it. What do the not successful yet ones do? - Um. - Come on, it'll be fun and I'll buy you a muffin. - Yeah, okay, yeah. - Okay, so what you need to be doing is walking forward and you need to walk and then we'll get into the position, okay? Yep, so ready, what you need to be doing, two, three. - Where were you? I text you ages ago. - So, is your girlfriend still living with us? - No. She said she doesn't want to put up with me in this mood. - Well, I got some news to put you in a better mood. - Really? Well, let me guess. A producer came out of the sky and offered me and you the lead role in my script? Oh, by they way, he said he wanted to pay for it. - No. - Well, it's not that good then, is it? - I met a journalist who works for the Actor's Mag. - Cross over, walk and pose. - She wants to write a story on us and she knows people, producers, directors. She can help us. She can help us get real acting work. Will you listen to me. It's worth a try and I hope you're better not sharing. - Give me five minutes. Benjamin, Adam, I'm so glad you could find time in your busy schedule to come and see you're employer. - Ola Larry. - Hi. Listen, we were at a call. - Benjamin, I'm sure you were, I'm sure you were. But I just want to know what happened because you have damaged my relationship with a very important client. - It's my fault, I was tired. - I don't care. One of you is gonna do a freebie for me tonight and preferably one with a working cock. It's a man. He's got simple tastes. He likes to watch, but believe me when I say that if you fuck this one up, I will make sure that neither of your dicks work again. Now you two have a wonderful day. I'll text you the details later. Show time. - Hi. Come in. I want you to lie on the bed. - Okay. - So don't speak please. - Well, look I prefer if we first. - Please, don't speak. I want you to take off all of your clothes and give them to me. I want you to touch yourself the way you want someone else to touch you. Please leave. - So what time is she coming here? - About now? - She a fit? - That's really professional. - Just asking. - There she is. - Hello. - Hey. Jody, this is Benjamin, the other actor. - Ben. - Oh, well, hello, Ben. I have been interviewing pretentious directors all day. Would you like a drink. No, don't worry, tonight's on the company's card. - G and Ts, please. She is fit. - Two double gin and tonics, vodka, orange juice please. Thanks. Here we go. - That's perfect, thank you. - A vodka and orange makes the day so much better. You're a struggling actor, too, then Ben. - Actor, writer actually. - Oh, one not pay enough for you? - Well, art is suffering. - Yeah, so true. - Well, you're in the industry, you know what it's like. - Yeah, well being in the industry, there's the occasional bit of art by accident. - So, you're telling me that with all these films and plays at around, you don't see any art in there? - Not as much as there should be. Why, is that what you want to do, art? - I could show you some art. I meant my script. - Let the interrogation begin. - So acting is how I express myself. You got the pen and he can't very well. I act. - That has to be one of the cheesiest things I've ever heard. - Oh, you two make such a cute couple. - That's just him. - Two double G&Ts and an orange juice please. - Listen, I need you to go home now, all right? - Oh, fuck you, you prick. - It's always funny when you talk. - Yeah, 'cause you want to try and fuck her. - Well, no, no, not try and yes. - What? We were supposed to make contacts. - And we have and this way we can have fun, too, huh? - Really professional. - Please, hmm? - Okay. - Ah, thank you, I love you. There she is. - There you go. - I'm gonna go home. I'm drunk. - Fair enough. - That's probably a good idea. You look like you're about to fall over. - Chow, chow. Mmm. So, what a shame, huh? Just the two of us. - Oh. You've got a nice flat for a pair of struggling actors. - Do you want to see more of it? - Doing pretty well for yourself? - Just got that with some luck. Do you want to see my script? - Stop it. Stop it. - Hey, Jody, it's Ben here. Hope you're okay. I'm just calling you 'cause I think last night we had a little bit too much to drink and there were things I might have said about Adam and myself, you know, what we get out to and I'd like to clarify for you a few things if it's possible and yeah, just give me a call back, all right? By the way, I had a great time last night. Okay, bye. - Is Susan going to be much longer? - I'm sorry, Mr. Miller, I don't know. You can always leave a message or call back. - I'll stay holding. - Hi, guys. Ah, writing. I'll stay quiet, I promise. - Hello. - Hey, Ben. I got your message. Sorry I've taken so long to get back to you. - That's quite all right, glad you called. - Hello, Adam, sorry to have kept you. - Hi, Susan, I'm just calling to see if there are any gigs coming up, any auditions for me or Ben. - You've nothing to worry about Adam, you're two of my favorite clients and I promise I am getting you out there. - Yeah, it's just that we haven't been getting much recently. - Well, you know what it's like. These agencies make their judgment on a single photo and there's a lot of guys out there more recognizable than you at the moment. - I know, but. - Are there gonna be any more interviews like the other night? - Well, the story isn't over yet. - Still interested in having a look at my script then? - Play your cards right, Ben. But since you mention it, there's a new theater production company having it's launch at the Valmont Club tomorrow. You and Adam should come. Could be some people there you could pimp yourselves to. - Isn't there anything else you can do for us Susan. - Once again, Adam, I'm your agent, you are my client, I will do what I can. Sorry, Adam, I have to go. I've got Richie Summers on the other line. - So, you'll meet me there then? - You and Adam. - But mostly me. - See you tomorrow night Ben. - Looking forward to it. - Who was that? - Someone who's interested in my work. - Who? - Well, you know, I've been sending my stuff out so finally it got someone calling me back. Gin and tonic please. How much? - It's free. - Oh, hi, Ben. - Hey. - I'll catch up with you later. - Nice suit. - Why don't you fuck off? - Behave. - Well, he was being rude. - Oh, you learn to ignore it after a while. - Is everyone here like that? - Most of them, but a lot of them don't even know why they're here. - What? - They're friends of friends. Anyone will go to anything for a free drink. Anyway, where's Adam? - Ben, where are you? Call me, okay. - Well, you know how quiet he is. Raging party's not what he's into. - Even if he can meet people to help his career? - Well, that's what I'm here for. - Yes, I want you to meet Peter Thorne. - Peter Thorne? - Yeah, he works for Nathan Dowling, the guy that owns Pedestal Productions. That's what all this is for. Be friendly and charming and he might just want to look at your script. Peter. - Ah. - This is Ben. - Hi, Ben. - Thank you. Jody here tells me you're responsible for this little party. - Yes, I am. Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to put on a really unique party in Soho. So, we thought we'd go for the basics of free alcohol and food in a pretentious location. So, how do you know Jody? - Well, I'm an actor and a writer. - Ah, you're squeezing her for a good review. I understand. I try that on with her every time Nathan and I put on a new play. - You and Nathan. - You know I do all the work. - Oh, darling, you said that. - It's the truth. So, what have I seen you in Ben? - Well, I've been recently auditioning for some adverts. - Oh, I'm sorry, truly dreadful work for an actor unless you're on six figures. - Yeah, well, I'm mostly working on my own script. - The whole I can't get work, so I'll make my own approach, hmm? It can work given the right positioning. - Positioning? - Someone who can invest heavily in it. And what have you been up to lately my dear? Still rubbishing the futures of Mycom patriots? - Actually, I'm looking to get onto a larger stage. - And another member of the well educated descends into tabloid journalism. - Not quite, but it does pay better. - Hmm. - Toilet? - It's just over there. Where did you get him from Jody? - Ben, I don't know what the fuck is going on, but this is taking a piss, I'm going home. - Man, it's getting busy here. - Yeah, one cubicle for a few hundred people. Feel sorry for all the girls. - Mate, you know what all this is for? - Yeah, some production company. - Cool. - Fuck this, I ain't waiting. - I just thought these things were classy. Just saw a guy pissing in the sink. - Be glad that's all you've seen. I've seen a lot worse. - If you'll excuse me, myself and Mr. Downing must address the masses and thank them for drinking us dry. And Mr. Aspiring Actor Writer, what's your number in case I wish to inquire about your script? - Uh, Jody, uh. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Thank you. - That's okay, you're helping with my article if you hadn't noticed. - So, how about we go home and thank each other, then. - Oh, got to stay here and work. I need to meet the right people saying the wrong things. - What about after? - Afraid not. - So, what was the other night about? - The other night was the other night. I'm sorry. I'm not trying to find someone like me, Ben. Stay here, have a few drinks, you might meet a few more people and I'll give you a call in a couple of days about the article. - Hi, Larry. - Good evening Benjamin. You sound like you're at a splendid little party. - No, not really. What's up? - Good news, the client from the other night, he liked you Benjamin and since you cost the money for two jobs. - Larry. - Benjamin. - Oh, fuck. Jesus, man, you should have warned me. - I want more. - I know you. - You don't me. You don't know me. Fuck off. You don't know me. Get out, get out. - Ah, you're Richie fucking Summers. - Ah, finally here Benjamin. It's the first time I've had to wait for you and not Adam. - Sorry I'm late. Why didn't you wake me up? - Where were you last night? - Okay, I'm assuming as you two called this meeting, you are after an update on what I'm doing for your careers. - Well, it's been quite a while actually. - Oh, straight to the point, all right? The feature we talked about, the one with the speaking role for you Ben, gone. The production ground to a halt. It's on indefinite hold until they find some more cash. And I'm sorry, Adam, there's been nothing much for you, but it's as we discussed on the phone. These agencies look at the photo first and then call you in for an audition. I suggest you get some new head shots. - Susan, we need to talk now. - I'll call you boys. - Have you seen this? - Well, that was shit. - Don't worry about it. - Don't worry about it? Ben, our agent doesn't even care to see us and what was wrong with you in there anyway? Starstruck Richie fucking Summers? - Listen, no, I don't care about Richie fucking Summers, man. In fact, I met someone who does care. A producer. - Where were you last night? - At a launch party that Jody invited me to. - Why wasn't I invited? - 'Cause I wanted to spend some time with her. - So, where does the producer come from then? - She wanted me to meet him, I mean, does it matter? He wants to read my script, man. - Yeah, well, good for you. - Adam, it's good for both of us. Listen, Gina's gonna be in the house now, so try to smile please. You're cooking? - Well, he had a meeting with his agent again and he's been writing again, so, I thought we should mess about. I'm doing some washing for you too, so, um, give you some time to do some more writing. Are these yours? - Yeah. - Then what the fuck is this note? Who wants more of what? Who's this? Is it her? - Gina, I don't know where the fuck that came from. - Maybe it was someone from the party last night. - Party? - You asshole. - I can't answer right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you. - Hi, Ben, it's Peter Thorne. We met last night at the launch. I was wondering if you'd be interested in meeting me for dinner to discuss your script. - Hi, you've come to reach Richie Summers, for any professional work, please contact Susan Blackturner, thanks. - Good evening Ben. Sorry about the short notice, but I always like to capitalize on new ventures. - No problem. Thank you for inviting me to your amazing pad. - I like to do business in the comfort of my home. Take a seat. Dinner will be ready shortly. Now. How about some dessert? - I think I could fit some more in actually. It tasted great, by the way. - It's what a main meal should be like. Delicious, but should not make its devourer overstuffed. There are plenty of things a person can do after dinner instead of waddling around like an overfed pig. - So, am I gonna get a chance to show you my script? - Have patience, it's not going anywhere. - I just don't get the opportunity for someone like you to see my work very often. - And you just wanted to make sure that I hadn't forgotten. I totally understand. Very well, let's get started. - So, what about dessert? - We can have it over here. - Um. I thought we were gonna go over my script. - We are. There's no need to become agitated. We'll look at your script. After you do a little something for me. - Are you interested at all in reading my script? - Of course. I'll be more interested when you come and sit down beside me again. Not even a little kiss? - Hey, how was last night. - He's looking at it. - Really? - Ah, good afternoon mate. Hard enough to hear from you in daylight hours. Just trying to force a bit of joviality. - Well, you're usually doing the salesman bit. I do need to get in mate, you shoot beautifully. - You're in a good mood again I see. - I don't' know, mate, I'm just running out of ideas. I'm nowhere as an actor, nobody wants to have a look at my script and I'm pulling Adam along with it. - Adam's a big boy, he can take care of himself. - He can't. - What are you, his dad? If you want to keep trying to be an actor, then keep trying. Just don't expect it to be fun. Or you can get a job like me and look hard enough till you find one that doesn't make you want to kill yourself. - It's not that easy. - Yes, it is. We both know what you want to do. Come on. - Hey. - Hi, Adam. Come and sit down. I was just talking to Ben about a job you guys were going to help me with. Since you boys have been so wonderful at answering your phones to me, I thought the best way to deal with this would be in person. - He wants us to be drag queens. - Both of us. - Yes, both of you. - I'm not doing it Larry. - Oh, Benjamin, I'm afraid you are. You see I've helped you boys out a lot and recently all you've done is help me lose clients. Besides, you're actors. You should appreciate the work. - Even the weird guy. He seemed fine to me and we're not those kind of actors. - Benjamin, you are doing this. Otherwise, you won't be getting anymore fucking work from me. - It's what you wanted. - See? It's what you wanted. You're doing this. And if you don't show up, I'll show you what else an angry drag queen can do with her stilettos besides walk away. - Come on. It can't be that bad. It's acting and we'll be doing it together. - Adam, it's not real acting at least no one would ever have to see me sell myself. - Isn't that what acting is? - All right people, let's get moving. - Here they are. Thanks for coming. Come on in and I'll introduce you to the rest of the cast. Everybody, this is Ben and Adam, our new Belle and Lavelle. - Hey, nice to meet you, man, Jose. - Hi, Becky. - Okay, boys, why don't you come and have a look at the changing rooms. You can have a look at your glamorous outfits and change into something more appropriate. Jerry, do you mind coming with. You can tell our boys all about our little show. - Thank you. - Jose, afterwards I want to see you in my office. - So you want us to get changed into those? - Not yet Benjamin. Look, just put on something light. We'll run a few basic routines so you boys can get used to the show and then we'll really work them. We've only got a couple of weeks to replace those cunts that left. - I'll wait outside. - Show a little enthusiasm. - Why? You have to lose a candle to be in the West End stage, you know. - We are in the West End. - You know what I mean. - The script's fun. Reminds me of us. - Well, no, it's not us, Adam. And you can't call that a script. - And what would you call it then? Because if you've managed to write something more successful, I'd love to hear it. Or maybe you can use your years of rent boy and advert audition failures to steer me to the heights of your career. Any other complaints? - He is a writer. - Well, writer, any ideas? - Maybe. ♫ Looked at my watch and it's a quarter past ten ♫ My phone ain't ringing, no texts, no pins ♫ So I'm here thinking you have ♫ Somewhere better to be ♫ 'Cause you ain't here with me ♫ You must be busy because you ain't even called ♫ I've left you several messages ♫ I'm waiting at the bar ♫ One shot of tequila ain't enough ♫ To wash my troubles away ♫ I don't know I might say ♫ All the excuses ♫ Can't buy me diamonds and pearls ♫ But I don't care ♫ I thought you were my man ♫ And I was your girl ♫ So don't test my patience ♫ Don't keep me waiting all night ♫ You always let me down ♫ The way you treating me ain't right ♫ Don't tell me what I wanna hear ♫ You're always messing with my mind ♫ Don't test my patience ♫ Don't keep me waiting all night ♫ Hey, who do you think you are ♫ You ain't some kind of rock star ♫ 'Cause I gave you everything ♫ Yeah, and in return you gave me nothing, nothing ♫ I tell you who I am, yeah ♫ I'm the best thing you've ever had ♫ 'Cause I cooked and cleaned for you ♫ While you watched TV ♫ You won't never find another girl like me, yeah ♫ All the excuses, yeah ♫ Can't buy me diamonds and pearls ♫ But I don't care ♫ I thought you were my man ♫ And I was your girl ♫ Don't test my patience ♫ Don't leave me waiting all - Fuck. ♫ You always let me down ♫ They way you're treating me ain't right. ♫ Don't tell me what I wanna hear ♫ You're always messing with my mind ♫ Don't test my patience ♫ Don't keep me waiting all night ♫ Don't feel my trouble ♫ I hope you see ♫ 'Cause what you could've had here with me ♫ Don't feel my trouble ♫ I hope you see ♫ Just what you could've had here with me, with me ♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♫ Don't test my patience ♫ Don't keep me waiting all night ♫ All night, all night ♫ You always let me down ♫ The way you're treating me ain't right ♫ You know it just ain't right ♫ Don't tell me what I wanna hear ♫ You're always messing with my mind ♫ So please, please, please ♫ Don't test my patience ♫ Don't keep me waiting all night (suspenseful music) - Hey, writer, your changes better not fuck up the show.

We have returned with a new and improved show and a new and improved Belle and Lavelle. - I am but a lonely boy with no other life to lead I long for some glamor and some pizazz to have both women and men look at me and wonder how did he get so wonderful? - I am sorry, but, I overhead what you were saying. I am currently on the path searching for those things that you spoke of. Come with me. Together we will be stronger. - But what if I don't want to? What if it's just confusion? - Wouldn't you rather be confused and fabulous?

He's been getting really fed up with things recently. - With being an actor? - With everything. - What about you? - I don't know, I'm trying to help, but. - Do you still want to be an actor? - I don't know. Don't know if I was ever good at it. - Anything you'd rather do? Ben told me what else you two do. - Oh. Anything else he tell you? - Nothing I really wanted to know. I'm not gonna use your childhood in the article, I don't need it. - Thanks. - Well, it's none of his business or anyone else's. - Do you like him? - That's a direct question. No, do you? - Hey, honey. You ready for this evening? Sounds like we've got a huge crowd out there tonight. Love word of mouth, love it. - I want to speak to you about something. - About what my sweet? - I was wondering if I could skip tonight. - What? Hang on, has this got anything to do with the romance going on? Don't worry about that my boy. That won't last. - Well, no. - Oh, fuck. - What? - Larry, I need to talk to you. - I already know. - No, Larry, I mean this. - Oh, no. - Guys, have you seen the people out there. We got photographers and everything. What, I know, I look good, don't I? - I'd like to apologize to my wife and my children. I no longer wish to keep my actions a secret. When I saw the picture of the boy I've been seeing, I took it as a sign to confess all to my family. - Hello, Peter. Are you watching the news? - Me and my family, my time that we richly deserve. Thank you. - So I'm a gay rent boy, drag queen struggling actor, whose ex-girlfriend took his erectile dysfunction as a sign that something was wrong. - So, does that mean we're not doing the show tonight, then? - No. We're doing the show. Well just imagine the publicity. This is your fault. If you don't perform, I'll kill you. ♫ Call my name ♫ The Glamour Dolls are here - We want more, we want more, we want more, we want more, we want more, we want more, we want more, we want more, we want more, we want more. - Man, I'm so ready for a fucking party. - I'm a go home. - No, why? - I'm just not feeling up for it tonight. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Can't we just go home and finally celebrate making it? - Well, no, just us isn't much of a celebration. - Ben, come on. ♫ I'm a glamour doll - What the fuck are you doing here? - That was brilliant. Men in sparkly dresses don't usually do it for me, but come here. Seriously mate, that was great. You entertained me. - And how long you're gonna rip the piss out of me now? - Oh, I haven't decided yet. - Well, you can fuck off in the same place you came from. - Yeah, I think I will. I'll let you ladies get dressed. Thanks for inviting me. - Hey, sorry. I just wondered if Adam was coming out tonight. - No, I'm just not feeling up for it. - Come on. - Are you okay? - Your mate didn't seem too happy. - Oh, he'll be fine. - Think he's jealous? - I don't think so. - Because my man's playing. - Right now to have the chance to get back my life and to get me and my family some time that we richly deserve, thank you. - Hello? Gina? - I came to give you back your keys. - Look, I'm sorry. But what you did was. - Oh, you selfish fucking prick. - Stop. What the hell? - I fucking supported you, looked after you, helped you and you're a fucking hooker. You could have caught anything. - Well, apparently I couldn't get it up with you, so I had to. - Maybe your boyfriend next door will put up with your shit. - Who needs a drink? How are you baby? - Long story. - Here he goes. - Guys, now we all know that the last few days have been a trial, but we've come through it unscathed and if anything more muscular, firm and rounder than before. This is the best cast that have ever put on the Glamour Doll wigs and I'm glad that it's you that has achieved success for us all. The tabloid sex scandal helped a little bit, but thank you all. Drink party and carry on. - Good boy Adam. Come on Adam, take it away. - Hey. - Hey, slut dog. Guys, get a room. - Didn't know your face looked that bad. The makeup covers that up well. How'd it happen? - Well. The night it all came out, I had so many photographers around me and me and Becky were just going through and I just turned around to see how many there were and it's like what in my face, man. And I didn't even realize and as soon as I began and what? - I thought Gina beat you up for being a selfish prick? - What? - Yeah, no, no, she called you a selfish prick, then there was lots of shouting and banging. You were screaming a lot, man. I mean, it was pretty bad. You were screaming like a little girl, you know it's true. - That's not what happened. - Hey, lover's quarrel. - It is what happened. And Gina's right, you know. You are a fucking selfish prick. - Yeah, he is. - Fuck you. - This party's dying. - What is wrong with you lately? I mean with everything? A little bit of fame, we get money, we both have girls who like us. People like our acting. What else do you want? - You see, selfish. - How is that selfish? We got what we wanted. - It's always what you wanted. It's what you want and fuck me. You even told Jody about me just so you could fuck her. - Told her what? We eat together, we work together, we share a fucking dressing room together. - You fucking asshole. How else would she know that we were rent boys, huh? - What are you doing? - Why with them and not with me? - Hey, man, Becky wants to play. - I'll be there in a second. - So you'd rather have that, that? - Yes, yes, because she's. Go and fuck Maddie, she wants you. - What you say baby girl. - Are you sure you want to do this? - What was that? What the fuck was that. - Ah, it feels good. - Oh, yes. - Do you like it? Are you happy now? - Oh, yes. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Keep it down. - He likes to make noise. - Is this what you want? - No. - Are you happy now? Do you like it. - Yes, baby. - No. - Are you thinking of my white tongue? - Yes. - No. - Are you thinking about my cock. - Oh, God, yes. - Fuck. - You know you want more. - Yes. - Oh, yes, oh. Oh, God. Yes. - It's okay. I'm done anyway. Oh, yeah. - Fuck. - Oy, get off my bed you pair of degenerates. - Besides, this is all new to everybody. I'm the same Richie Summers as before. - Well, let's see what the mirrors have to say. Right after the break we'll be back and we'll talk about this last person in your life, a young actor named Benjamin Spanner. - We were really drunk last night. - Richie Summers here today with us here in studio, we'll be right back. I haven't slept yet either. Too much coke last night. Listen, Ben, I'm sorry about last night, about all of it. - It's okay. You couldn't help it. - Yeah. - Hello? - Hi, Ben, it's Peter Thorne. - What do you want? - I read your script Ben. So did Nathan. - Nathan? - The owner of Pedestal Productions. Your recent brash of fame forced us to at least take a look. - Yeah, well, and what would I have to do for it? - Nothing. We'll leave that incident as the proverbial water under the bridge. Just come and see us. - So this would be a genuine meeting? - Yes, at the office and everything. - Where? When? - Ben. - Hi. - Introductions. This is Sara Lott, co-producer with Pedestal Productions. - Hi. - Apologies, Nathan can't be here today. He's busy working abroad, but we do have him on conference line. Are you there Nathan. - Yes, Peter, I'm still here. Hello, Ben. Glad you could make it. - Can I get you a coffee, espresso? - Sure. - Susie, can I get an espresso, double espresso macchiato, a skinny chai tea latte and a soy hazelnut cappuccino for Nathan. Not too hot. - Now, Ben, tell me what do you know about Pedestal Productions? - Um. - Well, what you should know is we predominantly produce very hip, very savvy cutting edge new plays. Like have you seen our co-production in the West End Lela Says? - No, I haven't. - Oh, great. Wonderful new playwright. You must see it Ben. He could be the next Dopard, we'll get you some tickets. But we're also looking at producing something with a bit more of a popular appeal about it. - Which is where you come in. - You and your play. - I saw your Glamour Dolls play, Ben, and noticed some similarities in the script. I take it you wrote that, too. - Yes, I did. - Understand Ben, I'm just checking in on you. I mean your current brush with celebrity might afford you some marketability, but it doesn't necessarily mean you're any good. - I totally understand that. - We believe the current hype surrounding you will help gain your place and attention from an audience that may not usually make it to the theater, tabloid readers. - We're tabs. - Girls with magazines, shit like that Ben. - We want you to sign your script over to us. You'll get a third at the box office and you'll get a co-writing credit along with Nathan and Peter. They're going to have to tweak it a little. - Throw in some of that drag queen stuff and something about outing a famous actor. - We could even get Richie Summers to play the part himself. - Oh, Peter, that would be a fucking sensation, wouldn't it? Let's just throw this shit to the wall and see if the fucker sticks. - I've told Nathan and Sara about your acting ambitions. To seal the deal as it were, we're also willing to offer you a minor role. - Well, that sounds amazing, but I also have a friend. - A friend? - Yeah, you see, this script is about myself and Adam and I always hoped both of us could be in it together. - Ben. This is a professional environment. It's not a business where we go around offering jobs to our friends. Seriously, Ben, we're already making you a generous offer. A co-writing credit, a role and not to mention all the publicity that a production like this is bound to generate. - Ben, you've got some trash publicity for a scandalous story. We're just suggesting that you make use of that attention whilst you still can. - It's a good deal Ben. You should take it. - Hey. - Hey. We need to talk. - Yeah. Yesterday didn't go so well. - Not about yesterday. Um, my play is gonna be made and I'm gonna be in it. - Cool, man. I'm sorry. - Small part, but I'm in it. They want me to sign off by the end of the week so they can start Monday. - Monday? - Yeah. So no more drags after the weekend. - Yeah. You won't like being in heels. - Listen, I tried to get you a part, but they didn't go for it. - It's all right. You were the actor anyway. Whatever. - So visit us mate. Well, you know the usual stuff. So I'm just gonna pop in your details as your user name. Password, whatever, THYT, you can change that later anyway. Uh, teas and coffees just down there, help yourself. I'm just down the corridor but if you need help just pick up the phone and dial 375 and that should be me, cool? See you later. - See you. - Cheer up. - We're gonna go clubbing. - Clubbing. - Welcome to the club. - Well, I was feeling a bit nervous, this is the first thing for me. - No, don't feel nervous. - Wait till you get the swing of things, you know. I mean that. - Guys Larry asked me to be here and I. - Thank you. - Well, you've been working for it. - I'm gonna try it on. - Grow up. - Whatever. - Adam. Adam. Adam. - Come on, cheer up. You're part of Pedestal Productions now. - I know. - You should be very happy. I'm just gonna whip you off completely. But it's okay darling. - I know you've always fancied him. - He's so cute. - You are such a cat. - Just 'cause you want him. - What difference does that make? - Come on, cheer up. - Come on, that's it. Big smile for daddy. - This is the big time. - Hey, there's a little thing known as excess, you know. - Shut up Jose. You know I need it to stay awake. - Larry, he's doing it again. - You're the sensible one here. What should I do? - Dump him. Plenty of actors have drug habits, but they don't all fuck up their lines on a regular basis, come in late and generally don't give a fuck. - You're a harsh girl. - So are you. Even you know that sacking him is like shooting a puppy. Do you want me to do it? Do you want me to pull the trigger? Splatter blood and fare all over the dressing room. - Don't worry, honey. I'll take care of it. I'll put my pimp face on. - Hey, Adam. Sorry about the play. - What do I care about the fucking play? - Can I walk you home? - Why? - I promise not to touch you or anything. I get that you still miss Ben. - Why? - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mentioned that. - Not everything is about him. - Okay. - Just go home Maddie. - Adam. Adam. Adam. Maddie. Maddie. Maddie. - What's up? - Well, I don't know if you're aware of this, but the numbers for the show haven't been what we call stellar. There have been a few more empty seats than we would have liked. - Still when it's full run, though. - It was almost six weeks, Ben. And the longevity of your name didn't do as much as we anticipated. - People still like the show. Isn't that important? - The reviews were average, but you've no need to get defensive about this. - So is this really what you wanted to talk to me about? - Well, actually, we were wondering if you could provide us with a synopsis and treatment for another project. - Not a script? - It would be easier for us to just go through a brief outline at this stage. - Okay. So, what's the pay like? - Pay? I'm not buying or signing anything from you Ben. We're simply interested in seeing your next idea. - What about a part in it? - I guess that would be the proverbial bridge we cross when we come to it. - Right. - Oh, don't be so downhearted. Be grateful we're willing to look at your work over the over hundred we get in. And don't forget the rep party tonight. - I think I'll give it a miss. - Hey, this is Adam, leave me a message. - Hey, Adam, it's me, Ben. Listen man, I want to talk to you. Just calling to catch up. It'd be nice to see you, all right? Give me a call back. Bye. - What the fuck, St. Peter, is this why you invited me? - I need some young hairless meat. Head down towards Long Acre. - No, Peter, I'm taking you home. - Oh, you owe me for all those drunken orgy celebrity stories I gave you, it's the least you can do. - I'm not having you and some rent boy fuck in my car. - Then drop me off. - Adam. - Oh, I'll take that. - Peter, get out of my car. - Fine. I'll search for my own. - Adam. Adam, wait, I know it's you. Adam. You're not. - I need the money. - I'm sorry. - For what? - Sorry for fucking up your life with a certain article. - I already knew I was a rent boy. - I'm sorry for not calling for months. - You can apologize for that. - I just thought you and Ben were pissed at me. - It was Ben more than me. I just kind of missed you. - Why? - We talked. - Look, do you want a lift home? What happened with Ben? You know I had to ask. - Not much. Did his play, move out. I missed a call from him earlier. - Did you call him back? - No. I don't give a fuck about him. Oh, God. Come on, come on, come on. - Adam. Adam. There's a little thing known as excess, you know? Adam. Adam. - Why are you still living with this loser? - Adam. I need you to go. Adam. - I get that you still miss Ben. - I love you. Ben, Ben, Ben. You two are my sons. Please ask mommy. She is my girlfriend. She is my girlfriend. I love you. Because I want to spend some time with her. I need you to go home please. - Larry? - Hey. Benjamin. How are you? How's the play? Come here and tell your ex-pimp all about it. - Hi, Larry. - How are you bitch? - I'm doing okay. Just finished my last round. - How did it go? - They asked me for another one. - Well, congratulations. Looks like you're doing well for yourself since leaving little old us. - I had to. For my career. - No one is judging. - How's everyone? - Well, big star still care? - Fuck's sake, Larry. - Wow, your ass is as tightly wound as your boyfriend's. - Funny. - What is with the attitude boy? If anything, I should be hating you. - Just busy and tired. How's Adam anyway? - Don't know I'm afraid Benjamin. We sacked him a few weeks ago. - Adam? You sacked Adam? - We had to. He was ruining the show. He built up quite an attitude. - Didn't you think he needed some help? - Yes, Benjamin, but we are not therapists here at Glamour Dolls. We're a business. And wasn't that your job? - What was I supposed to do? - Go see your friend. Go now. Just go now. Surprise him. It'll be fun. - Bye Larry. - Tell your boyfriend I said hi. I'll text you the address. - Hello? Adam. - Hello, who? - It's Ben, who else? - Ben. - Listen man, I'm sorry. I've been busy with Pedestal doing that shit, you know. Are you there? Are you okay? - I'm fucking so in love. - Listen, I saw Larry and he told me everything about what happened. Adam, are you there? - Yeah, I've been busy. Shit. - Dude, you're not making any sense. Adam. - Fuck. - Adam. - Yeah. - Adam. Adam. Listen. Adam. Adam, it's me Ben. Adam. Adam, are you okay? Adam, what the fuck is going on? Hey, Adam. Adam, open the door. Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam. Adam. Look at me. Look at me. Adam. Adam. Adam! No, no, no, no, no. Adam! Adam! No, no. No, no, no, no, no. Adam! Adam! No, no, no. - So have you read it? - Why would I want to? I know what happened. - Yeah, but do you know what really happened? - This is some crap, you know. And yet I need a book to make me feel worse. - Make you feel worse? - We both know why he killed himself. - Yeah, but it's not what it says in here. - What? Did I drive him to it? - No, actually you self-absorbed prick. It was an accident. - Bullshit. - It was your flatmate. You should know better than me what he was doing. Read the book. Meet your sales target this week and I'll let you borrow it. - Fuck you Gary.
