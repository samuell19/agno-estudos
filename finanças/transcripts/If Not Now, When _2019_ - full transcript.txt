I still don't understand why we have to wear these shirts, Tyra, and you don't. Suzanne, you've seen my boobs. They'll be a distraction and this is Dee's moment. I still think askin' would have been much easier. - Easy is boring. - And we agreed to stick by her with this. So come on, Suzanne. Get over it. Fine, but, Patty, I still think you should still ask Jason. Jason's gonna say "no", so why even bother? You don't know that. Okay, time check? It's now or never. I'll grab the CD player. I can't do this, you guys are crazy. I can't do... No, no, no. Hey, Henry. Will you go to prom with me? Um... What do you say? No. Your loss. Henry, you're a dick. And as a matter of fact, I heard yours was small, too. Teeny. I still can't believe we did that and he said no. I'm so sorry. That's exactly why I am going with Paul Walker. And I'm going with Vin Diesel. I don't care that he said no. I gave it a shot and I'm going with y'all anyways. Wait, I really need to, um, use the restroom. I don't I'll make it at home. I'll be back. Okay, hurry up. Does anyone wanna catch a movie? I can't. Back to back dance classes and an audition. Maybe tomorrow? You come home with me. You can help me with me with physics and crash with us. - Deal? - Okay, deal. Even though that's Tyra's subject. They are all Tyra's subjects. Speaking of, what is taking her so long? Tyra. T. T, are you in here? Patty. Patty, my water broke. It's too early. - Oh, shit. - I'm supposed to have another month. Okay, okay, calm down. - We'll figure this out. - It hurts. - Okay. - What the heck? What do you mean your water broke? You're pregnant? And you knew? Did you? Run to my locker and get my gym bag. - Dee-Dee, now! - I'm not goin' anywhere. We need to go get help. No, no. No, please. I can't do this right now. We have to figure something out. You're havin' a baby, so let's figure this out like right now. There is no figurin' this out. We have to go to the hospital. Wait, like you're really pregnant? Having a baby? But why didn't you tell us? We could have had a baby shower and... You just shut up and help us! How could you be so stupid? I mean we graduate in two months. Two! And, and you got a scholarship to Caltech. What were you thinking? Look, Ms. Holier than thou, this is our friend and she needs our help. We stick together always. We have a pact, remember? I don't care what you say, Patty. I'm going to get Principal Hargrove. Suzanne, please. I can't go to the hospital. Suzanne! Fuck you, Suzanne! - Patty. Patty, Patty. - I know, I know. You thought you had more time. It's okay. - Hey. - Uh. Sorry, I have to go, I'm late. Yeah, I know it, it was due a week ago, I just need an extension. Yeah, I get paid on the 15th, so I can pay it in full then. Yeah. Okay. Um, yes, I, I was not late last month, so... Great, I appreciate that, thank you. Oh, hey! Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Hi. - I'm good. - Good. Hey. Ready? Uh, she should be here in just a second. She doesn't want us to go in without her. - Patty. - Yeah. I'm here, I'm here. Let's go. Okay, Max, I'm ready to go. You guys didn't have to come back, I'm being discharged. Honey. What is it, Max? I called the girls to come back here. I... We... You need help. You have a problem. I don't know how to help you by myself anymore. I do not need help. I don't have a problem. You fell asleep in the garage last week. Oh, my God. That was once. And besides, I have a prescription for these pills. You hurt your back last year. You should not still be takin' those pills, Tyra. Okay, well, Patrice, you don't know my pain. Love, when one of my dancers on tour hurt her ankle, she wasn't... Deidre, please stop with the dance stories. Just... You guys, I am fine. I'm fine. You OD'd. People that OD are not fine, Tyra. Okay, and I don't need you to fix this, Patrice. But that seems to my job when it comes to you. I took a pill. I took one pill and I forgot that I took it and it... I accidentally took another. It's not a big deal. That is so bullshit. It is bullshit and you know it. No, you know what's bullshit is you guys tryin' to come in here and ambush me. - That's not what this is. - No. Fuck off, Patrice. You can take your damn cape off. Max, please, get my doctor. I'm leaving. You know what? This was your idea, wasn't it? It was mine. Yours? Yep, Suzanne came down from her ivory tower to make sure we took care of this the right way. Castle Bend has an opening, they will take you tonight. You need to go. - Baby. - Stop. - Please. - No, stop. Stop! Okay, yeah. I... I see what this is. What is this, your atonement for your disappearing act all these years? Yeah. I don't need this shit. I'm going home. With or without you, Max. Excuse me. Let her go. Mom, you forgot we had practice. Again. Mom. Mom! Mom! Mom! Um, hello, 911? My mom is on the ground and she's not breathing. Mom. Mom, please be okay, Mom! Mom! Jill. Jillian! Still think you don't need help? No, I got her, I got her. She's really not gonna come in? I think she just needs a few more minutes. She doesn't wanna stay with me either. I got her. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna get out of here. Thank you. Bye, T. Hey, she's still in the car. Everything okay? Yeah. You guys, this is... This is a good idea. What are you even doin' here? - Patrice Anne, don't start. - No, I wanna know. Why are you here? Are you here because this is the right thing to do and Suzanne always does the right thing? I'm here because she's my friend. Friend, okay. We've seen you, what? Three times in the last six years? I tried, you made it impossible. You didn't try hard enough. My car is leaving in five minutes. - She'll come around. - Hm. But she's right, I do miss you. I miss you, too. - We should get lunch or something you know, catch up. - Yeah. I'm serious. Okay, well, give Trevor my love. I will. Checking out, fit. Sleep. So why didn't you tell me about your, uh, your field trip? J.J., why did you tell me just now? Phew. I asked you a question, J.J. Jackson Alexander Ellis, Jr., shrugging, not an answer. They reminded us last week. Uh, and you're just telling me this now? Where's the note? Yeah, ma. I forgot and I lost the note. Hm, okay, you forgot. Forgot what? I need to take $50 to camp for the end of the summer trip. It's due today. And I was just telling your son that he won't be able to go, because I don't have the money and he shouldn't have waited so long. Uh, uh-uh, fix your face. I'll give it to him. No, you won't. That's not the point, Jackson. Go grab your stuff, so I can drop you off on my way home and no Fortnite, man, none of that. I gotta be to work at noon, okay? All right, hurry up. Thank you, sir. Excuse me. If you need some money, yo, just let me know. I got you. We're fine. I wanna help, Dee. Jackson, I got it. I'm managing. Thanks for um, staying with him last night. But you don't have to thank me for taking care of my son. I could be taking care of you, too. In more ways than one. - Did you... - Yeah. You are relentless and stupid. Come on, babe. You know you miss me. Admit it. Admit you miss me. - You know what I don't miss? - Hm? Your listening skills, the shoes. The shoes. You know, there's no shoes in my house. Uh, my bad. That's on me, I'm sorry. I got my stuff for Dad's, too. And yes, my bed is made. Thank you. Come here. - I love you. - I love you, too. All right, look, uh, we'll see you at the center on Friday and I love you. I love you, too. - All right, man. - Bye. - What you smilin' about? Let's go. - Have fun! Thank you. You could have made me go home with Max, but you didn't. Sweet pea, Max is trying, too. Do you wanna tell me why you are so angry with him? Nope. Do you wanna talk about anything? Nope. Okay. Yes. Yeah, I do. Hm. Where were you? Jill, I didn't know. I mean why didn't you tell me it got so bad? You know what? - Forget it. - Jill! It's fine! I'm fine, okay? That appearance gig fell through. Said they decided to go with an active player. I'm sorry. Same shit. Every fucking day. I thought we agreed you would sleep in the guest bedroom. I messed up. I apologize. It ain't gonna happen again. Now, come on, I ain't gonna sleep in a guest room in my own fucking house, Suzanne. What do you think about Katherine, after your mother, for the baby's name? How about we name her Leslie? Or maybe Sara? Or Janice? Or, or Starr? - What about Starr, hm? - Don't start, Suzanne. How do you like that? I mean they all sound like really, really nice names. Maybe our daughter will chase after married football players, too, hm? Fuck you, Suzanne. And you know what? Maybe, just maybe, that football player will turn out to be a lazy drunk, too. Well, maybe you made me that way! Did you call that guy about the real estate job yet? No, my knees hurt. Your knees have been hurting for a year. That's what happens when you play ball for 20 years. It is just always a damn excuse with you. Well, we ain't hurtin' for money. And who made sure of that? Ugh. That's a beautiful Friday morning to drive. Okay, so I'm going on tour in the fall and I need a choreographer. I don't wanna hear it, you are already approved if you want it. Look, you are the best choreographer I've ever seen, ever, and you actually know how to construct a show. So what do you say? Jo. Come on. First-class flights, five-star hotels, a budget I should be ashamed of, but I'm not. And Barcelona. Barcelona? My last city. Dee, it will be like old times. Hey, thanks for coverin' for me. - Anything crazy? - Nope. Oh, Michael actually showed up on time. Oh, that's two weeks in a row. I know. He would never admit it, but he likes it here. Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's up, everybody? Stand on up. Let's get on up. Good afternoon, Miss Dee. Afternoon, Cecelia. Okay, who can show me part of the dance we've worked on so far? Michael, you can show us after we warm-up. - Yo, my hand wasn't even up. - I know. All right, everybody, on the floor, start to warm up, okay? - Hi. - Hi. You made it. Hey, yeah. Auntie Patty said that I had to come, so I'm here. Right, come on, love bug, join us. Wait, you mean I have to participate? Oh, yeah. What did you think you were gonna do? Just stand around? No, that's not fun, we're dancing. Oh, no, I, I don't dance, Auntie. Look, neither did I when I first started. Just do your best, no judgment zone. - Uh... - It's gonna be fun. Hey, Cecelia, would you mind showing her around? - Sure thing, Miss Dee. - Thank you. Follow me. You'll be good, you'll be good. Hey, uh, Matt Grayson has a sick deep ball. Thank you. Now, you're gonna go down the hall to the room on the right. Group, we have a new member today. Please welcome Tyra. - Hey, Tyra. - Hi, Tyra. All right, gang, let's begin. So who took a moment to write down... What it felt like the first time the first time they got high? Anybody, anybody? Anybody? Ah, Elaine, go first, my darling. I mean I didn't write it down, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Go ahead, yeah. Um... I remember feeling like... the world was closing in on me, and I was living in a black hole that was swallowing me whole. I mean, I couldn't take it anymore. The baby wouldn't stop crying, the bill collectors wouldn't stop calling. A buddy of mine used to get high. And I lit the pipe... and for a brief second it felt like everything around me went silent and I could finally see a sliver of light at the end of the tunnel. And then my high came down, and boy, was it a bitch. Wow. Thank you, Elaine. I appreciate that. Anybody else? You guys are awfully quiet today. Come on now, what's up? Come on, come on, come on. Tyra. Tyra? Tyra. Therapy is a part of the process. But I don't need to be in this process, that's what everybody doesn't get. But you're here. You know what? I am not a junkie. Occasionally, I take a pill, but you know what? I have a prescription for those. That does not make me like them. And let me tell you something else, because you don't know me. I graduated top of my class, I went to Caltech on a full scholarship. I did all of that. I did that with a kid. Okay? So I'm not going to sit here and listen to people, who actually are really addicts, share their issues. It's not for me. Hey, I want to check myself out. You can't. I so fucking can. I came here voluntarily. But you signed a form that said your husband is the only one that can sign you out. Sometimes I think I should have been able - to prevent all this. - Why? Because you see addicts everyday on the peds floor? No, the truth is if someone doesn't believe that they need help, then all the people in the world won't be able to help them. You gotta stop blaming yourself for things that are completely out of your control. Thank you for listening. And, I'm sure this not how you wanted to spend your break. It's the only way I want to spend my breaks. Come on, are we going to do this again? I know we had fun. We did, but... "But"? No, no "buts." All right. Don't dash a brother's spirits. All right, you pick the date, you pick the time, and I will be there. Patients be damned. So you are willing to just let folks die to have dinner with me again? Code blue all night just for you. You're a horrible doctor. Yes, I am. Okay. We can go out again. You check your schedule, I'll check mine, and... - Okay. - Dr. Jordans. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there. You promised. What are you guys having for lunch? Take a break. Lunch time. Hi. - Hey. - I'll be back in an hour. Thank you. You're welcome. Sent you a few messages yesterday. You never got back to me. I know. I got them. You know, avoiding my calls, isn't going to make me go away, Suzanne. How's your friend? She decided to go to rehab. So we'll see if it works out. I miss you. I miss you. Carl. Carl, I... I love you. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I can't. Stop. This is bullshit, Suzanne. I can't do this today. I wanna be with you, but not like this. Him or me, but not both. I made a commitment, Carl. Yes. You did. You made a commitment under completely different circumstances. You don't deserve to be happy? There is a whole other person that I have to think about now. I do not want to be a single mother. Who said you had to be? It's not the same, Carl. My whole life, I have done everything right. I went to college, I met a guy, I fell in love, I said, "I do." Why would you suddenly expect me to do it wrong? What has doing it right gotten you? And just so you know, you sticking around and having his baby, it's not going to make you love him. And... Yeah, I'm... I'm gonna willfully step back. - What? - Yeah. I want more. Can you honestly give me that? Yeah, that's what I thought. I'm out. Carl. - You have a pen? - Yeah. All right. Good bye, Michael. Hey, I said, "Good bye, Michael." All right, yeah. Peace, Ms. Dee. Hey, Michael, remember, you... "Are not my circumstances," yeah. - Yes, yes. - Yeah, I know. Hey, have you ever seen this high school shit? - Grayson? - Yeah. Yeah, like all of it. All right. That's dope. Yeah. All right. Um, I'll catch you. Bye. You did well today. - Uh, cool. - Great. I was going to have you make you help me sweep, - but it's all right. - I can grab it. You know what? Why don't you take my summer workshop? Just three days a week. Not a bad way to spend some time, right? - Sure. Okay. - Cool. Um, Michael? Yeah, what about Michael? - Jillian! - Nothing. Hey, what's up, favorite dude? - Never mind. - I missed you. You haven't been over in a while. I got the illest new game today! - Really? - Yeah! Okay, so why don't we ask Auntie Patty if you can come over tonight? I'll beat you in Madden, but like not too bad. Huh, you never win. - Oh? - I got this. - Okay, in your dreams. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Ma'am, I was looking for Jillian. She used to be about this big, she used to slobber on herself all the time. I think you... - Okay. - Come here. - Hi, Uncle Jack. - What's going on? Good to see you. I'm almost done here. Help me out. I could take you out to dinner, you know, if you don't have plans. - Jackson. - It's one dinner. Yeah, Ma, it's one dinner. Wow. You actually ate Indian food. Uh, yes. It was definitely different. Well, not as good as what I had in Mumbai, but... I'll have to take your word for it. So you want to come in for some tea? Unless you have other plans or whatever. I can stay. Good. Take off your shoes. Oh, got other plans. Oh, my God. Please. Oh, please. Oh, that apartment was the worst. One room and a makeshift bathroom. That's... How did that even happen? And walls so thin you could hear when our neighbors took a shit. - It was like... - Oh, I can still it hear it now. Oh, God forbid they were having sex. No, and you know what? No, we had them beat in that department. We had them beat. But you know the thing I miss the most about that dump? We were together. I mean, I would sit there on that futon just watching you dance, and I'd just be like, "Yo, this is life." Then J.J. came and everything was complete. We had a family. Yeah, but that was all you wanted. And another baby. You told me, "Your dreams are killing us," and you walked out the door. I did. I did. Babe, I came all the way out here just to show you how much I know that I fucked up. I just want another chance. I want this to work. You usually used to go that way. Is that... Okay, I mean... - I mean, it doesn't matter. - It has been six years. Let me just... Oh, fuck it, come. Just go, just go. I've done majors that nobody did. Look at that! What you doing? - Get out! - Yo, yo, hold up. Get the fuck out of my house, you dirty fucking bastard! In my bed! - In my fucking bed! - Calm... No! What the fuck! Have you lost your goddamn mind? - Get out! - Fine! But this is my goddamn house. What you going to do when I leave, huh? Your perfect little world will be shattered. Not like you got any friends anyway. Tyra, your husband is here to see you. No. So, is this gonna be another 50 minutes of me watching you? I'm here. You are. There are some questions in here. Take a look at them. Fill them out if you feel like it. See you tomorrow. You look nice. Thank you, sweet pea. Max called. He said you won't answer his calls. I don't want to talk to him. And I don't want to go to that stupid family day either. Jill, it's been a few weeks, I think your mom would really like to see you. I guess. Okay. Tell me about the center. - Making any friends? - One. I guess, yeah. - It's cool. - Yeah. I guess that would be Michael. Okay, Auntie Dee-Dee talks too much. - She really does. - Yeah. She can't keep a secret. Oh. Damn. Uh, he's right on time. - That... - He is. - Is that good or... That's good? - I think so. - I think so. - Okay. Oh God. Okay. Well, let me go get that before he thinks that you stood him up. - Okay. - Okay. - Jill? - Mm-hm? I love you. More than anything. Are you serious? No, no, no. No way. He is not the best. If there were one minute left in the fourth quarter and no timeouts, I want Grayson all day. Okay, he is like so cool under pressure. Look, how are you gonna argue with five Super Bowl rings? Simple. A good coach and luck. - Luck? - Uh-huh. That's all you are going to give the man? Yeah. Week three, last season. I rest my case. Wow. You look great. Thank you. Shall we go? This is nice. What? You, me, here, again. You not running. I don't run, I jog briskly. Briskly, right? You got jokes. So tell me. What is it that you want? What do you mean? You know, out of life. Your dreams? Your desires? Oh. Did I say something wrong? No. Um... Just... I haven't thought about it in years. Me and my girlfriends used to sit around for hours and plot out our lives. I mean down to the color of our bridesmaid dresses. Seems like a lifetime ago. So much has changed. For the good or bad? Depends on who you ask. Suzanne came the closest. She married the NFL star and got the life she always dreamed of. And you? I stopped dreaming a long time ago. Packed them up with my ex-husband. That's the way you wanna live? Works for me. Okay. I had a wonderful night tonight. - So did I. - Hm? Mm-hm. I know you're not going to make me beg to take you out again, right? No, we can work on that. Okay. I'm going to get going now. I'm on call tomorrow, so... Okay. Please let me know that you made it. You let me know you made it home, okay? - I will. - Okay. - Good night. - Good night. Yeah. Why you always wearing some football shit? Yo, maybe because she likes it, Cecelia. Yo, why you gotta be such a bitch? Listen here, felon, - don't be calling me no bitch. - You know, I ain't no felon, Cecelia. Hey, just... You better listen to the girl. You don't want another strike. Why did you do that? Thank you for meeting me here. - Oh, no. - I just couldn't get away. It's no problem. It's actually... It's really cool what you do here. Thank you. I mean. it's not what I planned on doing, but, you know? - Pregnancy looks good on you. - No. Is Trevor excited? Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know? I guess. Sit. All right. Spill. Go on, talk to me. Uh, we're friends, right? Yes. I'm miserable. Dee, I am... I am just completely and utterly miserable. I mean... My marriage is just... It's a joke. And, I think I'm in love with this other man, but I can't have him because of this... f'd up situation, so... Oh, I wasn't expecting that. Trevor has just cheated on me more times than I can count and I have stayed with him because that is what women are supposed to do, right? And I keep... I keep telling myself, "It'll get better" and... - It never does. - No. No. And then this baby... this baby was just a drunken weekend of us attempting to try again, again. And I... I... I couldn't get rid of it. I mean... A baby wasn't high on my list, but it's a baby and... I'm supposed to want to be a mom, right? You're supposed to want what you want. There's no rules. God, I don't even know what that means anymore. To want what I want. I don't... I'm sorry, I have been talking too much. No. No. No. Come back. You need us. We need you. And I know you and Patty have your... your friction, those little digs or whatever, but you're really two sides of the same coin. Everything is right or wrong, black and white. Life is a whole lot of gray. - Will you eat something for me, please? - Yes. Thanks. - Yeah. - Here. So this is, uh... where I've been staying. - Well, you look better, T. - Hm. Thank you. Thank you. The food here is terrible. But they are treating you right, right? Yes, Patty. No need to beat anyone up. Um, Jillian's been taking my dance classes, she's really good. She really has a natural talent. Is that right? Jillian. Sorry. Yeah. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Jillian. Don't go gettin' disrespectful just 'cause I'm not home. As soon I get home, things are gonna go back to the way that they were and this little blip will be over before you know it. Blip? No. No, see, this is exactly why I didn't wanna come here. Okay, Mom, this wasn't just a blip. I had to give you mouth to mouth! You pop pill after pill, after pill, after pill and I see you! - Don't talk... Just stop it! - Oh, no. Goddammit, Tyra. What is your problem? - I'm sorry. - She didn't deserve that. - She doesn't deserve any of this. - Oh, I didn't mean to. She wants to be mad, dammit. You've earned the right to be mad, okay? - Don't take it out on her. - I didn't mean to. - I'm sorry, Jillian... - Don't touch me. I wanna go home. Now. Jillian, you are right. I'm sorry I promised to love and protect the both of you. I'm sorry. It's not your fault, Max. I'm not your kid. I'm hers. - Jillian, I didn't mean to. - I'll be at the car. Jillian! - I didn't mean to. - Excuse me. Max? Max. Work the program, T. You gotta work it for her. Let's go. - Bye. - I didn't mean to. It was an accident. Okay. We are here, so let's talk. Now. I don't have anything to say. Yes, you do and so do you. So come on, let's get it all out in the open. Go. You bailed on us. - You pushed me away. - No, you bailed! When Deidre needed you, when Tyra needed you. - Hell, when I needed you... - All right, fine, I bailed! I bailed. And I used your attitude as the excuse, but the truth is I was embarrassed. My life was shit. My life is shit. Everyone always thinks that being married to an athlete is this glamorous thing, like it's... like it's private jets and... and fast cars, but no one ever shows you what it's like being cut from three teams. No one ever shows you what it's like when your husband's career ends at 32. No one ever shows you what it's like paying off women and praying that the paternity test comes back negative. No one ever shows you that. And I could not face that. I couldn't face you. Shit. We can really go fuck up Trevor if you want to. God, you really need to check your aggression levels. Look, it's not all on you. I could have reached out, too. And I could have reached out when James left. At least, asked you why. So are we good? - We're good. - We're good. Huh? Okay, good, hug. Yeah. Yeah. - Yes. - I'm so hungry. Why is it you're always hungry? I am always hungry. Come on in. - Can I? - Sure. - Beautiful children. - Thank you. Lisa was, um, ten in that picture and Eric was eight. - I can't do this. - Do what? Any of it. I mean... I mean I've only answered one question in the notebook. My baby came to visit me, and... I was so frustrated that she had to see me like this that I lashed out at her. She has more strength and smarts in her 15-year-old body than I ever had. Where do you think she gets it from? Certainly not me. Hm. Is that the woman that you have come to know as Tyra? I didn't think so. And that's not the woman Jillian has come to know as her mother. But before either of you can know who that woman is again, you have to be able to look in that mirror and answer "yes" to that question. That means working from the inside out. You have to do more than show up, Tyra. I'm gonna give you a minute, okay? Mm-hm. Okay. What the fuck! Oh, hell no. Shit. What the... You gotta be... What's going on around here? Oh hell, no! This my shit! This my shit! Suzanne! Suzanne! Oh, fuck that shit. She got my shit out here on the fuckin' couch! We brought you some cider. And I have wine for us. Hey, babe, slow down. So what do you think about me moving back in? - Babe? - I heard you. Well, Jackson, you can't just, you know, throw our family in a microwave and voila, everything is magically done. But aren't you enjoying this? - Us? - Well, I am. I am. Six years. So you don't need me anymore? No, Jackson, it's... it's... it's not about, you know, needing you or not. I... I found a routine. I... I... I don't know if I learned to survive without you. No, you have. Look, you grew up. You're in school, you're learning new things. That's surviving. But I mean why... why can't we survive together again? As a family? Uh... Oh. The first week after you told me you wanna divorce me, I was... wanting you to say those exact words. No, no, no, let me finish. I was hurt. You know, it's like in one fell swoop... Pfft, my whole family was just gone. And I kept thinking, "He's gonna come back. "He's going to realize that he made a mistake." But you didn't. And I was left to pick up the pieces. Johanna offered me a job. Yeah, she, uh, needs a choreographer for her new tour. I took it. I need this. So, us? Jackson, I need this. Oh, okay. Okay. What... what do you need me to do? - Um, you could be there for me this time. - Okay. You know, look after J.J. I can. I can do that. I... I can absolutely do that. Thanks. Ew, that's gross. Can we go to Fatburger? How do you know about Fatburger? - Do you eat Fatburger? - What? Um, Dad and I go all the time. Dad... You and Dad go all the time? - Wait, is that a problem? - Yeah, wait. - Jackson? You and Dad... You and Dad... - What? I really felt... - Go all the time? - Yeah, you know what? - Salads for you, man. - No, no, no. Let's go to Fatburger. - I'm gonna see... we gonna get you a Fatburger. - Daddy's gonna pay. - Daddy's gonna pay for Fatburger. - You're gonna get a fat salad - is what you're gonna get. - Come on. Come on. It's on Daddy. Let's go. - Come on. - Really? Hi, yeah. Yeah, so we're looking for... - Excuse me. - Hey, hey, hey. Mm-hm. What are you doing? I am, uh, cooking you breakfast. Oh, I'll wash my hands. No, I said, "I'm cookin'." So what am I supposed to do while you cook breakfast? Uh, chill. Relax a little. Okay, well, can I at least make coffee? - Sure. - Thank you. So what are you makin' me? I am makin' my world-famous French toast, some hash browns, and, uh, some sliced tomato. Okay, sounds good. And fattening. It's all right to have a little every once in a while. You know, I never really get to do this. You know, one day I wanna make this like a... a family tradition, you know? Junior in the kitchen with me, his little sister off with his mom, doin' whatever they choose. We'll call it "Men-folks Saturday." Two kids? Yeah, yeah. Oh, and a dog named "Ralph". Ralph. The all-American tradition. For sure. I know you got some dreams tucked away in there. Nope. All right, I'm gonna get them out of you one day. Uh, hi. Bye. Sure thing, yeah, let's see. - Uh, would you please sit down? - Yes. we have kids to get stuff out of the house for us. No, but they are having so much fun. - So? - Oh, yeah. Okay. So, um, how does it feel to live in this big-ass house all by yourself now? Oh, it's different. I mean... I just... You know what? Never mind. This is supposed to be a celebration, we are supposed to be having fun, right? - Yes. - We are celebrating you. Yes, yes, yes! To Dee-Dee's dream job. - Well, you know, we're not sure... - Oh, no, no, no, no. He said that he has you and he's gonna support you, so let's just trust that he has turned over a new leaf. Hm. Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, whoa. Did you just shrug? - Mm-hm, we saw that, yep. - "Ms. Shrugging is not an answer" just shrugged. - Uh, you see everything. - Yeah. - I knew. - Yes, I... - I think she did. I think she did. - Yeah, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. - To my new job. - Yes. Dad? Dad, can you come play Marco Polo with us? You too, Mr. Walter. Yeah, come on, Mr. Walter, don't be a punk. I mean, Mr. Walter, let's go. - Hey, that... that sounds like a challenge. - Let's go! Marco! What you got? What you got? All right, who's Marco? Probably me if Mr. Walter would stop cheating. - I'm not cheating, man. Come on. - Yes, you are! Oh! - I hit the fireball! - Let's get it. - Oh, see, oh, look. Here we go. - Oh, oh. So Patty, later on tonight, you and Walter can sleep in the guestroom on the right side of the stairs, and then you and Jackson can be on the left, and then the kids can stay down here. - Did you just... - What? Did you just list all four other rooms like it's no big deal? Oh, no, no, no, they are just things. Believe me, they do not make a home. Guys... There's... - We're here... - Oh my God. Together. You know, let's bask in this. Oh, like, that peace pipe you smoke must be some, like, next level shit. Shut up. You ruined my moment. Okay, okay, okay, okay! I was a beacon of hope in my family's eyes. The first one that was gonna go to college. So when they got that call that I had given birth... my mom refused to come to the hospital. She turned her back on me. I spent two months in a home until I graduated and continued to make a plan for a life for me and my daughter. I haven't spoken to my parents in 15 years. It was all a struggle, college and graduate school, but I was doing it. And uh, my friends pitched in. Patrice is pretty much like her other mother. And with their help, I graduated on time and got a scholarship to graduate school. I was sailing, but inside... I was dying. It was just so much pressure. So much I felt like owed my kid, but when I met Max, I felt like everything was coming together. You know, he... he loved Jillian. And... we became a family. I had a family. But there was still that pressure. One day, I was in a rush. I was, um, picking up Jillian from a friend's house and I got into a car accident. They prescribed me Oxy... and... that first pill... Wow, yeah. It was like, all the pressure was gone. Yeah, and um, I hadn't known what that felt like in 15 years. To have no pressure. And so I took another one, and another one... and here I am. I'm an addict. And I don't wanna be one. Thank you. Come, come. Good girl. Good girl. That was really nice. I understand why Jillian wanted to stay. And those kids. I didn't realize how much I missed my nieces and nephews. Everything okay? Yeah, of course. Uh... you're sure? I mean, you've been real quiet. I'm sure. You have a five-year plan. Hell, it might even be three? Yeah, I, I guess so. And that plan includes a house with kids that look like you and more nieces and nephews to add to the Jordans' tribe. Uh, wait, where you going with this? Are you... are you pregnant? Uh, are you? No, I'm not and... I never will be. Wow, uh... - I... - Look, you want 46 years and date nights and Junior helping you in the kitchen while his sister hangs out with mom, and... Marco Polo, and video games, and I can't give you any of that. Okay, okay, look, I don't... I don't know what you want me to say here. All right? I just... Look... you don't have to say anything. I like you. I really, really like you. But... I know what comes next. So I am gonna save us both some trouble and allow you to bow out now. Good bye, Walter. Patrice! Look, let me in, all right, please. Look, we can talk about this, all right? I'll make this right. Oh, thank you. Thank you again, though, for coming. I think you'll enjoy the article. Uh, honestly, thank you for having me. I'm really lookin' forward to seeing how it turns out. - Of course. - It's nice meeting you. Nice meeting you. Hi. - Hey. - How have you been? Uh, good. Good, no complaints. Good. Good, that's really good. And you? The baby? Same. Same, no complaints. We had an appointment earlier on today and... everything's good, so... You know, I was, I was um, thinking that maybe we could grab dinner or something? I miss you and I think we need to talk. I miss you, too, Suzanne. We could go to that Italian restaurant that you like or I could... I could cook. Yeah, but I... I won't have dinner with you. I told you I'm out and I meant it. - But I... I've... - Good luck with everything. Guess it's just us. - Cool. - Cool. Hey. You actually brought it? You know, you could have just mailed it. I wanted to see you. Hey, I can't stay. But I should have told you this a while ago, you are wrong. About? You are my kid. Maybe not by blood, but you are just as much my daughter as you are Tyra's. And hey, I get it. You got a lot of feelings you're tryin' to figure out, but I need you... to know this, okay? I love you. I love you. When you're ready to come home, you come home. I'm not goin' anywhere. Okay? Okay. - Hey, let's show this off. - Yeah. Well, it's really dope. Thank you. - See you later. - Okay. Bye. I don't know how she's so healthy. I mean no prenatal care whatsoever. Yeah, but um, other than the chicken pox, like nothing so... Oh God, and that was a nightmare. But other than that nothing serious. Oh, except for potty training. Potty training. She would not get on the toilet unless Patrice and I sang this one song. Yeah... I guess I did manage. Um, I think you're ready for another notebook. Yeah, I think I am. Yeah, I think so, too, my dear. For you. I will see you in group. I will see you in group. Thank you. No, honey, thank you. I'm so sorry. It'll be okay and our little girl will be okay, too. So you guys ready to order some food? Your aunties will be here any minute, but we can go ahead and get started. - Michael, your grandmother knows where you are? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Uh... Yes, Ms. Patrice. She... she knows. Uh, yeah, I guess we can order. I'll come get the menus. - Okay. - We'll be right back. I got this in the mail yesterday. Did you write her back? Choice is yours. Max says there is like this family day and that he'll take me if I wanna go. Do you? Maybe. It's up to you. But know no matter what... I always got you. Because you love me more than anything? Mm-hm. And don't you ever forget it. Here, take these to Michael. Okay, we won't be in you guy's way. You're never in the way. We're here! Just gonna take my shoes off. Of course, you are. In the kitchen. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi, Aunt Patty. Bye, Aunt Patty. - Oh. - Uh. - There you go. Hi. So, this is actually a mini-ambush. What do you mean? You'll see. Follow me. Uh-huh! Wha... What... What is this? - All, Patty. - No, stop it, you helped. That nursery still was empty and we have a new niece coming. - And before you say anything, we have a crib and bassinet... - Yeah. ...being delivered next week. How... When did you do... I love babies. And buying stuff. She likes buying stuff. Oh, yeah, sure. I mean I was gonna... I was gonna do all this myself, but... Now, you don't have to. Is it wrong that I haven't fully accepted that I am gonna be... a mom? I always thought that when I become a parent, I would have a husband to go along with it. And I always thought that if I was gonna be a parent, I would be pushing it out of my own body. But... things don't always go the way we want or the way we thought. Oh, Patty, I'm... It's okay. It's okay, it's okay, I promise. It's okay, it's fine. - Want some wine. You got wine? - Yeah. - Let's have wine. - Let's have wine. Cider for you, missy. Cider for you, missy. Come on, let's kick those kids out of that living room. Wait, you didn't run to the elevator and tell him about Trevor, you just let him walk away? Oh God, you messed up now. The shrugging. What? Yes, no, I just left it at that, Deidre. I mean what was I supposed to do? Run down the stairs in my condition and just... pull a Say Anything... moment? Maybe. I just don't want you to give up. Oh, wait, wait, she wants you to do like she did when she caught herself in love with... - What was his name? - Henry. Henry James. You know what? You know what? Shut it, okay? I put myself out there. I tried, and I put myself out there, I was open to love. No, you put out before prom and got played. - Yes. - Oh, yeah. She's kinda right, you were kind of a fast ass. - Yes. - Screw you both. Screw you both. I liked sex. And I still like sex. But the point is, I tried. And you should try, too. Okay, so what... what was I supposed to do, Deidre? Should have I said, um... ♪ Oh no, I can't let you Get the best of me ♪ Even though deep inside ♪ Something's dyin' to see ♪ How you put... ♪ Okay, okay, okay! God, you two are assholes. Give me some more wine. Give me. Thank you. And you, you... you know, you messed up. What? I told him, he was silent, so I just did what was inevitable. You know, you always do that, right? - What? - Decided the way something was gonna be acted before it actually happened. No. Uh-huh. - No. She's right, she's right. You are right. You need to allow yourself to open up to the idea of, of something good happening. Oh. Thank you, Iyanla. I hate you both. I really do. And you're welcome. Oh, thank you, guys, for this. Seriously, I needed it. You guys... when Tyra comes home, this will be our new normal. - Cheers. - Yay! - To us. Back together. - Yep. - Mm-hm. Yep. - Again. - Again. - Okay, I got it, I got it. Got that checked for you. Where you goin'? I'm tired. I gotta to go. - We... - Tell J.J. I'll pick him up tomorrow. Okay, but you don't have to leave. But is this how it's gonna be from now on? For now. Look, I don't know, Dee. I'll call you tomorrow. Ms. Dee, Ms. Erica... Come quick. They're fighting. - Who? What? - Jillian and Cecelia, they're fighting. Are you kidding me? Go, go, go! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Get off her! What the hell is going on? Jillian! Cecelia! Oh, so no one's gonna talk? Okay, Erica's gonna deal with you all. We're goin' to a hospital and get this looked at. Call their parents Get in here, now! What are you thinkin'? You know where I am if you need me. Hi, may I speak to Tyra Harving? It's a family emergency. Who is it? Lorna. Yes? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You don't look fine. Well, I said that I'm fine, so... Come on, man, back off. Okay, I'll back off, I back off. I just heard you were upset, so I thought you might wanna talk. Well, there's nothing to talk about, because I said that I'm fine. So I just... I wanna... I'm gonna... - Okay. - Lay down a little bit longer. Okay, all right. - My door's always open, okay? - Okay, thank you. All right. Me! And he... and he served me. At work? He served me! Oh. This idiot served me at work. I'm about to be a divorced single mother with an infant, no husband, and he served me at work! Okay, whoa, whoa! Wow! Stop it. Come over here, come over here. Be careful. Whoa. Sit. Okay. Calm down. I just... Just for me... I just wanna... You knew that the divorce was coming, so are you more angry that he served you first or at work? What? You've been ranting for 13 minutes straight and she can't figure out if you are more upset that he served you at work or that he served you first. I personally think we should just keep destroying' Trevor's shit or whoop his ass. Of course, you do, Patty. Look, you kicked him out, you changed the locks, you won't answer his calls. It's like, what do you expect? I wanted to serve him, when I was ready! I wanted to choose. I wanted to be the one to decide. Okay. But you did choose. You chose when you kicked him out of the house and you've been choosing ever since. You made the choice. Mm-hm. I really got my life back? - You sure did. - Yep. And adios motherfucker to Trevor. And now, you focus on Carl. Duh. But you know what? I think it's time that I focus on me. Feel better? Surprisingly, yes. Good. Yeah, I'm not gonna be the only one cleaning up this mess. I took the other two last night, that's the last one. You wanna talk about it? Have a seat. My baby got beat up. She got beat up really bad and I just kept thinking if I had been out there that would have never happened. She's not a fighter. Somebody had to have provoked her. Did you know I was an addict? 18 years sober. Every day is a test. You see, I still remember um, when they took my kids away and put 'em in a foster home. And you see, I also remember when I got that call... Someone abused my baby. Mm. Oh. How did you resist? I didn't. Oh, and I got plastered. You see, I don't remember um, falling through a glass window at a diner. I was pretty cut up. Really bad and they didn't even think if I was gonna make it. But after I got out of the hospital, I realized the only way I was gonna protect Lisa and Eric was to get better. And it's been an uphill battle ever since. It's a continual fight. It is one that you have to wanna win. I just don't wanna keep letting her down. How about you stop letting yourself down first? I think I need to stay. Then stay. Stay. Yeah. Patrice, wait. How you doing'? I'm good, Walter. You? I'm good. I'm gonna just say this. I know you had some hard knocks in your life, I... I don't think that should keep you from dreaming' and believing in other people. You gotta tear that brick wall l down a little bit. Not everybody is gonna be strong enough to jump over it. Don't go. You started to share all of these things that you wanted. You saw your life so clear. When we found out that I couldn't have kids, James played it so cool. He said it was no big deal until it was. And eventually, he just resented me until he killed us... I'm not him, Patrice. I know. Just... I got so scared with you. What if I can't complete this ideal that you have in your head? All of that can change. One day, you are gonna have to take a leap and trust that somebody is willing' to catch you. Now, I really like you and if at some point further down the line... We can make this work. There are so many ways that we can make a family. I'm not just locked into one. And look at you and Jillian. Do you love her any less 'cause she's not your... your kid? No. I... I even looked into adoption, but... You say this now, okay? But what if you change your mind? What if my cracked up uterus gets in the way of your life plan? My life... my life plan? Patrice, we have no idea what's going' to happen in the future, all right? All we can do is control is right now. We live for now and we continue to live for now. Okay. Okay. I wanna leap. And I want you to catch me. I'm gonna catch you and your cracked up uterus. So you never coming back to class? You came all the way over here just to ask if I was coming to dance? I mean, who else I'm talk to? Those things that they said about me and my mom... My dad, you know, split and my mom got locked up, people made mad jokes and I fought. But Ms. Dee said I ain't my circumstances and neither are you, Jillian. You know, my mom is... Getting' help. That's good for her. Shit, it's more than some peeps. You're not like the boys I go to school with. And you're not like the girls I go to school with. Like Cecelia. Uh, you're dope and don't even know it, which makes you a lot doper. Okay, now you're just pushing it. I'm serious. Oh, I hope she don't kill me. Will she be mad? - I can't make any promises. - You can't make any promises? - No. - If she tries to kill me, it's on you, I'mma haunt you. - Okay. You're gonna haunt me? - I'm gonna haunt you from the afterlife. Okay, cool. Here she comes. Hey, Ms. Patrice. I didn't go in, I promise. I believe you. Would you like to stay for dinner, Michael? I would. I just have to call my grandma and make sure it's okay. Good. You guys can come in now. What's up? I'm going back to class tomorrow. I like Michael, too. Look, I did not say anything about Michael. You didn't have to. I was 15 before, too. Is it my fault she has to stay? No. Your mother is finally taking responsibility and making a choice for her. So what do you think about Walter? I dig him. Why? Do you like him again? Maybe. Yeah, you do. Hm, yeah, you better get some rest if I'm dropping you off to Michael tomorrow. - Uh, okay, you know what? - What? It's not Michael, it's dance. - Mm-hm. - Mm-hm. - And facing my fears. - Oh! Okay, I'm not letting others define me. Oh. Okay, yeah. Yeah, you don't need socks with that, you're good. Dad! Hey, son. Hey, let me talk to your mom for a minute, all right? All right. Hey, don't put too much milk in, okay? Yes, ma'am. You want me to quit? - Again? - Yeah. No. Uh, I don't know. I've put family before my dream, over me before and I still ended up divorced. I want both. I deserve both. I... I think I'm jealous, babe. I've... I've never had a dream before. I mean, not really. Not outside of you, and J.J. and our family. Nothing like... Boab trees, just nothing like this... You know. Listen, it's not too late to start. - It is really scary, you know? - Oh my God, it's like... - Really scary, I can't... Oh, I ain't even gonna lie. - I swear. Hi. - Hi - Come on. Hi. - Hi, honey. - Hi. Do you mind if we have a... a moment by ourselves just before we sit down to eat? Yeah, I'll wait here. Okay. Come. Come with me. What does this remind you of? When we used to go to that one park near your school. I don't remember the name, but you used to push me forever. Remember when I used to try to get you off, you'd always throw a temper tantrum? I think one time I even threatened to leave your little butt. One time, you did. No, I was... I was hiding behind a tree. That was mean. Sit down. Is staying gonna help you stop the pills? I think so. What can I do? Be you. And maybe forgive me one day. I'm working on the forgiveness part. That's all I can ask. I remember how you used to be. Before the accident. It didn't seem bad, but... Was I too much? No. No, no, no, no, no, no. You're not too much. I could live a thousand years and I could never... I could never make it up to you, because you and I, we were a team and as the captain, I let you down. But you, you my sweet girl, you... are the best thing I've ever done and none of this is your fault. You got that? - Got it. - Good Anything else you wanna ask me? No. You wanna go find Max? Uh... yeah, but um, first we have a surprise for you. You have a surprise for me? It's a good surprise. Hi. Hi. And then what happened? Well, your mom played lookout. - Oh yes. - Oh? - Yes, yes. - Oh my gosh. - Yes, wait, she was always lookout. - Yeah. Yes, I was the lookout, that was my job. And I do feel like I was very good at it. I don't believe that. That's my point. - And this one here. - Okay. This one here got the maddest... I think any of us had ever seen her. I did, I did. And instead of picking up one egg, I picked up three and threw them at the same time, - which was a big deal for me. - It was. But what she didn't see was Principal Hargrove coming out. Oh, no. And then she hit him with his toupee goes flying. His toupee? Nobody in the whole school knew we did this. Until that moment. And then we all got grounded. - Terrible. - Mom, you were a terrible lookout. - Well, at that time, I was. - That time. - But usually... - No, like most of the time! You were never good! No, I wasn't! Babe, I never knew this side of you. That's because you let them and they'll tell all your business. We have tons of stories, we have so many. - Oh my gosh, yes. - So many. Spill. What's wrong? Okay, either I just peed myself or my water just broke. - Yeah. - Oh, let's go. - Mm-hm, it's time. - What? It's time!
