One, one, Riana is her name. Two, two, she's so strange and lame. Three, three, stay away, me and you. When she comes, quickly tell her shoo! Her mother loves to beautify corpse. Her father loves to make coffins. I bet their daughter is friends with ghosts. Don't forget to bring tasty food again tomorrow, alright? Poor child,... ...your life will be full of suffering. Disasters will... ...envelop your life, child. Look at this. Look through this mirror. One by one, those closest to you will be doomed. Let me go! Let me go! Cursed child! You just wait and see. Your life will never be happy! Oh, Riana? Your niece Riana is now... ...in primary school, she's independent. So, Irma is now able to help with the work here. With regards to the business,..... Well, there's one or two each day. In a month, there's always something. It's not a lot but it's enough. This is how it is now. If it wasn't me,... ...who else would want to continue our father's business? Daddy. -So, Johan, your offer about... ...moving to your house, perhaps now is not the time. But Johan, thank you for your offer... ...of inviting all of us to move there. Okay, I'll send your regards... ....to Riana and Irma too, alright? Riana, come in. How was school? My friends are nice. As usual, we shared the food we packed and... ...went home together while singing. Mum? Mum? -Yes? Once you've done beautifying this old lady,... ...then it'll be my turn, alright? Riana, do you remember what I told you? Mum? Mum! Mum! -Don't disturb me when... ...I'm working. Remember? Mum! Mum! Mum! -Riana, enough! Let me work. Go to your room this instant. Yes, mum. Sorry. Riana, by the way,... ...please put out the candles that are in the coffin room. No one has come yet, isn't it? Dad and mum certainly... ...were always around me... ...in this house but... ...their hearts and minds were not. While they kept appearing,... ...with their ugly appearance. Do they want to be friends? I do not like them. They are scary. There's a fire! Riana! Irma! Fire! Riana! -There's a fire! Riana! Where's Riana? -Irma! Riana! Riana! Riana! -Riana! Januar, my little brother! Hey, Johan. Welcome, Irma and Riana. Like you said the other day..... -Yes, Johan. Finally the right time has come for you guys... ...to come to my house. Your face? -The fire..... The fire made..... -Oh, made me look... ...far more handsome than my younger brother's face. Isn't that right, Irma? -Yes. Come, come on, have a seat. Please have a seat. Please. What's with all this luggage? Where are you going, Johan? The usual stuff, Januar. A sudden business trip. I have to go to Europe. There are many antique collectors there. Hey, Riana. Are you scared or not... ...of all these antique items that I have? I have many more in the storeroom back there. Wow! Awesome! She's really brave, Januar. You guys can stay in this house... ...for as long as you guys want. Even if it's forever. -Thank you, Johan. Thank you. -By the way,... ...your rooms are upstairs. Januar and Irma, you get the room on the East side... ...and Riana's room is right across it, alright? My storeroom is back there. There are antique items in it... ...from around the world. Some of it have spirits in them. I was just kidding, Riana. You guys are so serious. So, for those 10 years,... ...I've been in this junk business. Even though I don't believe in mystical things... ...but a few years ago,... ...a psychic came and gave me a piece of cloth... ...with a symbol on it and some crystal stones. He said the symbol is a seal of protection... ...from supernatural beings. So, I placed it next to the door to the back storeroom. It'd be better that you guys leave the symbol alone, alright? Riana! Close it! Riana! Don't play with that particular box. The myth is that this box contains all the evil forces... ...that can cause bad luck. I'm serious this time, Riana. Sorry, Uncle. -Yes, yes, yes. It's alright, Sweetie. It's alright. Sit down here. Well, obviously closed boxes and rooms... ..always makes people curious, isn't it? I have to go to the airport now. You guys have a good rest, alright? We'll have a long chat again after I get back from Europe. Alright, Irma, Riana? -Thank you, Johan. Have a safe trip. Januar,... ...you're my only family. I'm so happy we can live together here... ...and... ...we can get together again like we used to. Okay, Johan. -Alright? Thank you. -Have a safe trip, Johan. Shortly after Uncle Johan's departure,... ...our family received bad news . Uncle Johan passed away... ...in a plane crash . In his will and testament,... ...Uncle Johan left all his wealth to dad... ...including this house... ...and everything in it. Riana, dad and I are going now, alright? You stay at home. I've prepared some food for you... ...which is on the dining table. Riana. Riana. Wow. It's a doll. Did you call me? Hello, Riana. My name is Annie. -Annie. Annie? I'm Riana. Riana, Annie,... ...Riana, Annie, Riana,..... Riani! I'll name you Riani. From now on, you belong to me,... ...you'll forever be my friend. Annie. Come on, Riani. Eat your soup while it's hot. What? You don't like the soup mum cooked? Hey, Riana. Where did you get that drab doll? Riani is not drab. She's pretty. She's my best friend. Riana! No. I wasn't the one who did it. Since when did you learn to lie? Riani, you just want to stay in the room, is it? Riani? Are you doing that? Me? I can't do what you do. You want me to give it a try? Since then,... ...when Riani is near me,... ...I have the ability... ...to move objects around me. Riana? Yes? Who are you looking for? Is this Riana's house? I'm Klara, Riana's school counsellor. Riana also has trouble sleeping. She often wakes up in the middle of the night. It happens so often. -Riana,... ...your school counsellor is here. Come on, open the door. What is the doll's name, madam? Riani. She calls it Riani. Hello, Riana. How are you? Riana? You must know why I'm here, right? You've missed school for two weeks and... ...your friends think you're sick. Are you sick, Riana? Or perhaps you've problems with the other students? Very well, you choose to be quiet. But that doesn't mean we can't communicate, right? Not all communication must be verbal. Did you know that... ...ants communicate with touch and pheromone? Even sign language is a form of communication. With this,... ...you can write down whatever you're thinking. You need some space? Okay. Go away! Finished? You want me to go, Riana? I came here to help you and... ...do you really want me to go? Not you? Then who wants me to go? Your doll? Her name is Riani, right? Riani,... ...why do you want me to go? I came here to help Riana. We will try another way. I'll ask a question and you don't have to answer. Let the natural response in your body give the answer. Ready? Riana,... ...have you ever felt scared in your life? A trauma from the past or perhaps the behaviour... ...of those around you don't please you? Trouble sleeping? Alright then. We've communicated well today and... ...I'll give you a present. This thing. Behind this thing,... ...there is someone who is loyal, trustworthy... ...and who'll accept you as you are. It's you yourself. When you are doubtful and anxious,..... Cursed child! Wait and see! -Trust the person reflected... ...back at you. -You'll never be happy in life! Alright then, Riana. I seek my leave, alright? From a medical perspective,... ...Riana probably has Tourette's Syndrome... ...which is involuntary muscle movements... ...of the face, hand and neck. Whereas from a psychological perspective,... ...Riana needs further treatment. Perhaps because of the fire that we experienced. And lastly, Riana has a tendency towards... ...Indigo. -Indigo? Yes, a sensory excess to feel things that... ...normal people don't feel. So, what should we do? I once volunteered at a rehab clinic... ...for teenagers who had similar symptoms as Riana. We received all kinds of grievances... ...in terms of medical, psychological and even spiritual. It's not far from here, only two hours away and... ...this clinic is sponsored by a foundation. So, the costs are affordable. So, preferably when should Riana start her treatment, miss? The sooner the better, madam. This is my telephone number and behind the card,... ...is the address of the clinic I mentioned. Thank you. Riana,... ...mum and I had a talk with Mrs. Klara earlier today... ...and based on her recommendation,... ...we've made a decision. I'm signing you up at a rehab clinic... ...to join their program for six months. And because you're not allowed to bring personal belongings,... ...you must leave your doll behind. Perhaps I can donate it for children patients at a hospital. Riana? Hey, Riana! You've to be out of Riana's life. Oh, God! Irma? Irma! Riana! Riana, come here quick! Irma? Irma, what happened to you? Irma? Riana! Riana! Come here quick, Riana! Irma? Klara speaking. Miss, it's me, Januar, Riana's father. Oh, Mr. Januar. What can I do for you? Riana's mother and I were in an accident. An accident? Are you and your wife alright? Yes, I'm doing fine. Riana's mother is also... ...currently receiving treatment... ...from the medical personnel here. But it's Riana. -Riana? What about Riana, Mr. Januar? -Well, Riana is at home... ...and she is alone. So, that's what happened. I've another video as proof. Here. See for yourself. Here it is, miss. Telekinesis. Cursed dolls . Hello, Nurse Asri. It's me, Klara. I need your help. Wow! So, this is Riana's house? It's really big, isn't it? Anggi, you're really not scared if we stayed here? Besides, we don't have anyone else anymore. We've no father or mother. Anggi, we came here to help Riana so that... ...Riana can communicate again, just like you guys and... ...helping others is the same as helping ourselves. So, Riana is like how we were a year ago, is it? Quiet, moody, aggressive. And a scaredy cat. -Hush! That's just you, Anggi. Every individual is unique and Riana has a different problem. But I'm sure, Riana could be cured just like you guys. Riana? Riana? -Perhaps Riana went out. You guys wait here, alright? So, you'll go back to Bandung next week... ...after our therapy is done? I'll come along. Okay? Riana! It seems like Riana isn't at..... Oh, Riana? You..... We came here to keep you company, Riana. Go away! -Wait, wait. Wait. Your father asked me to come here. Your father called from the hospital. He wanted me to check on you. What are you thinking about, Lusi? No, I'm not thinking of anything. Lusi is thinking that when she gets married,... ...she wants a house as big as this, Anggi. Isn't that right, Lusi? -Really, Lusi? No, no. No, I wasn't. Riana, thank you for letting us in. This is Anggi,... ...Hendro and Lusi. We came here to..... Perhaps Riana needs time to accept us. So, what should we do now, miss? I will look for a spot for our activities and... ...you guys can just rest for the time being, alright? What are we going to do in a place like this? It doesn't even have a TV. It would be better to go... ...to the cinema or otherwise, to Fantasy World. Luis, you want to have... ...a date with Hendro, don't you? Hendro, your bracelet. My parents gave me this bracelet when I was little. This bracelet will light up brightly if I have a chance. So, if I lose hope, this bracelet will light up. I see. That means I stand a chance then. Oh, the bracelet has gone dim again, hasn't it? Humans are individual creatures as well as social creatures. Although humans are the most intelligent beings... ...here on Earth but we can't live alone. We need other humans. Yes? -So, ghosts can depend... ...on other ghosts too? Possibly. -With humans as well? Riana? Are you deaf? Or you don't have any manners? When Miss Klara asks, you should answer. Just because this is your house,... ...doesn't mean you can treat us like this! Lusi, leave Riana alone. -What is it, Hendro? Why are you defending her? You can see how she behaves... ...towards us, towards Miss Klara. Luis, that's the reason why Miss Klara brought us here,... ...to help Riana communicate well. We used to have difficulty interacting too, isn't it? Because our minds were filled with voices,... ...visions and feelings..... -Yes, yes, yes. Whatever it is, I don't want to know, alright? You don't have anymore excuses not to answer. If once again you don't answer,... ...if again you don't..... -Sorry, kids. What's the matter? Everything is okay, right? Lusi? Teacher, I'm going to the toilet first,... ...alright? -Yes, alright. Luis, wait for me. I need to use the toilet. Don't take too long. Oh, my God! No! Get away! Lusi? Lusi? Lusi? Lusi? Lusi? Hello, sweet girl. I thought just now..... Such is the life of the Indigo children. They must be good at managing their feelings and thoughts... ...in order to be accepted by society. Without proper guidance and a proper outlet,... ...children like you are prone to depression,... ...a prolonged sense of despair that will have a bad affect... ...on the body and soul especially in the current era. A technology and communication era that is becoming more advanced. True. Can you imagine that on social media,... ...people call me crazy, hallucinating,... ...in need of an exorcism. Who wants to be an Indigo child? It's totally lame. Lusi? Lusi, awesome. You're pretending that you're being possessed... ...like you're being possessed for real. Lusi? Hello, sweet girl. What's your name? Come on, come with me. Lusi? Don't be afraid, sweet girl. We'll dance and sing together,... ...all day long. Come on. Ouch! Lusi, that hurts! -Let her go. That hurts! Let go of that doll. Let go! I feel dizzy. Hello, Mr. Januar. We've been here since noon... ...and we're doing some activities... ...to train Riana's social skills. I hope Riana isn't giving you any trouble there, Miss Klara. No, sir. We're fine. -Miss Klara,... ...there's another thing I need to tell you. Please stay away from the area around the back storeroom... ...because there's a lot of dangerous antique items there... ...and regarding the Riani Doll..... Hello? Sir? What about the Riani Doll? Yes..... -Hello, Mr. Januar? Hello? Miss Klara? -Mr. Januar? Hello, Miss? Hello? Riana? Riana, what happened in that room just now? I want you to tell me about Riani. I've heard many crazy things about the Riani Doll and... ...I don't want anymore people to get hurt, Riana. Go away. Do not disturb me. Whose names are these? There are many evil creatures... ...roaming around this house... ...but not Riani. Riana, we're doing all this for your own good. Riana, focus on this pendulum... ...and I want you to relax. When I snap my fingers,... ...you will comply with all of my requests... ...and nod your head when you understand. Alright,... ...it's just the two of us now. I'm Klara, Riana's teacher. You're Riani, right? Riani,... ...if you really are residing in this doll,... ...please give me a sign. Blink,... ...move your hand,... ...laugh, talk or anything at all. Riani,... ...I just want you to know... ...that Riana needs to interact with her friends... ...and Riana has new friends now. Lusi, Hendro and Anggi. You don't like Riana having new friends? Riana! Riani? Riana! -Riani? Riana! -Riani? Hi, sweet girl. We will dance and play together... ...all day long. Who are you... ...and what do you want? Give me back Riani! Riani? Whether you like it or not,... ...you have to let Riana have other friends. Riana is a human child... ...who needs to socialize with other friends. Not with a doll that..... You did this, didn't you? They were right. You're a haunted doll. You're alive, Riani. Stop it! Don't. Don't touch this doll. She can harm you, Riana. She can harm me. Riani is not evil. Riani is good. She just wants to play. Didn't you see what she just did? She wanted to hurt me, Riana! You can't be anywhere near this doll. This doll has been possessed by an evil spirit. Come with me. -Where to, Riana? Riana? Riana! Lusi, Hendro! Riana? Sit down. Sit down, sit down. Teacher, I'm scared of what Riana is going to do. Be calm, Anggi. We'll find out soon, alright? Sit down. -No! I don't want to play... ...games like this. -Sit down. Teacher, what is she going to do? Riana will show us that... ...the spirit who is disturbing us, is not Riani. Malevolent spirit,... ...show your identity. Riana, what are you doing? He won't talk,... ...have to use letters from blood. Riana, enough. Enough! What photo is that, Anggi? -I took this photo from... ...the corridor at the back of the house. B, A, V, A, G, O, G, H. - We'll take a break. Riana, you're not alone. We have all experienced the same thing as you. Okay, among you is there anyone who wants... ...to share their experience with Riana? I've been able to see ghosts since I was little. No one believed what I said. My friends said I'd gone mad. Even my own family said that I was a daydreamer. But everything changed since I met Miss Klara. Now I'm able to see my ability as an advantage... ...rather than a deficiency. But even till now, if I meet ghosts,... ...I still feel scared. In the beginning, I didn't know that I had this ability. In fact, I myself denied it. I began to be afraid to deal with other people,... ...afraid to meet other people... ...because I was able to feel what other people felt... ...and I was able to hear what was on other people's mind. Yes, but why does it seem as if... ...you're not sensitive to what I'm feeling? Riana, can you give me your hand? Laila? Laila! Help! Laila! Help! Hendro? Sorry. Anggi? Riana? I have the ability to..... To..... Riana, may I borrow your doll for a moment? May I? I told you I was busy! Look! Look at what you've done! You messed up my work! Father,... ...please forgive me. I didn't mean to disturb you. I was just..... -Just what? Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Hello, sweet girl. Poor girl,... ...what happened to you? Father. I'm looking for my father. Look at you,... ...such a pretty face,... ...such beautiful skin. How could your father abandon a girl as beautiful as you? You look so miserable. Don't be sad, little one. I will take you to a magical place. Enough! Okay, I think our session today is over. We'll continue it tomorrow, alright? Good night, Anggi. -Good night, Lusi. Lusi? -Yes? Just now, did you see Hendro's expression... ...when he was touching Miss Klara's hand? Yes, I saw. What about it? Hendro must have seen and felt Miss Klara's sadness... ...because she failed to stop Laila from killing herself. Hush! Anggi, we shouldn't be talking about that. I bet Miss Klara is still sad till now, isn't she? Enough of that. That's grown-up stuff. Little kids should stay out of it. So, are you a grown-up, Lusi? -There you go. You just won't listen. Enough, now go to sleep. Riana is an interesting case example. She doesn't want to communicate with other people. She just wants to talk with her doll. A doll known to be cursed . Dragon Statue. Private collection. Ming Dynasty. A mirror that can see the invisible. The Annie Doll. Isn't this Riani? A doll that belonged to a girl named Annie... ...who was abandoned by... ...her own father and fell victim... ...to a serial killer who killed girls... ...named Bava Gogh. Annie's spirit who longs... ...for love and affection, inhabits this doll now . Bava Gogh was the one who killed Annie? This cursed photograph is a post-mortem photo of... ...a children serial killer named Bava Gogh. After Bava Gogh was caught red-handed killing,... ...Bava Gogh was sentenced to death. But before being sentenced to death,... ...Bava Gogh had a final request that... ...his body be immortalized through a photograph. Initially this photograph... ...only showed Bava Gogh by himself . Who is it? I want... ...your head! Calm down. There's nothing, Lusi. Perhaps you were dreaming. A ghost... ...without a head. -Alright, now go back... ...to sleep, alright? Hello, sweet girl. Who are you? They call me... ...Bava... ...Gogh. That's a funny name. Come on,... ...they are waiting for you. Who are they? The other children. There are other children besides me in this house? They are waiting for you, Anggi. They are in the back storeroom. Anggi? Why aren't you asleep yet? Just now there was..... Alright, go to sleep, Anggi. Yes, Hendro. I almost got that sweet child. You have thwarted my plans. I have been waiting for this opportunity... ...for a long time. -Who are you? You are the killer Anggi told us about. Why did you do it? I just wanted to protect them... ...from this cruel world. There cannot be... ...anyone who can hurt them. I will send them... ...to the eternal playground. There's a rabbit! It's so cute! Miss Klara! -Anggi? Miss Klara! Teacher! Miss, there's another thing I need to tell you. Please stay away from the area around the back storeroom... ...because there's a lot of dangerous antique items there. Anggi,... ...what are you doing here? What did I tell you? Come stand up. Come on. A rabbit came in here just now, Teacher. There was also the man who had asked me to play last night. He then went into this photo. Went into this photo? Bava Gogh, the children killer. But it seems like I've seen him. Who is he? This is a post-mortem photo... ...of the children killer... ...and what you see here is a corpse which was photographed... ...as if he was still alive. What lunatic wants a photograph like this? In the olden, post-mortem photography... ...was very trendy in America and Europe. It is said that the figures of children in the photograph... ...are always increasing. -The objects in this room,... ...I'm very sure that each of it has a spirit in it. Miss Klara,... ...look at this mirror. This mirror is black in colour. The Obsidian Mirror. It is said,... ...that this mirror is able to show invisible beings. Able to see ghosts? Hendro, take this mirror and then ask the children to go out. Okay. Miss? What happen? What's the matter? What have you been doing in the storeroom all this while? Yes. -We've been waiting. But you're alright, isn't it? You're alright, isn't it? Yes, I'm alright. Here's the mirror. So, if we have that mirror,... ...we'll have the same ability like Lusi? Able to see ghosts? Not really because sometimes there are some ghosts I can't see. This mirror is able to show any beings. Even those that don't want you to see them. Riana,... ...do not move. Riani. That mirror. Why did you guys take it out? You guys went there. You guys went into the storeroom. You guys disturbed something evil... ...and dangerous. Children, come on let's go. But why, Teacher? -Come on let's go. Too late. He will never let us go. Riana! -Riana? Riana! -Teacher, help Riana. Riana? Riana? -Whoever you are,... ...please let Riana go. Riana has done nothing wrong. She has separated me from Annie. Riana! Let Riana go! Let her go! She has done nothing wrong! Anggi! Anggi! -Let Riana go! Anggi? -Riana has done nothing wrong! Let Riana go! She has done nothing wrong! It is time to play! Hendro! Hendro! Hendro? Hendro! -Lusi! Hendro? Hendro? Riana, take this. Go, Riana! Go! Go! Go quickly! Lusi! Lusi! Let Lusi go! -Lusi! Let's go! Come on, let's go! -My camera! Teacher! My camera! Riana! Go! Go! -Riana, come on! Are you guys alright? Is anyone injured? Bava Gogh is after the Riani Doll... ...because he doesn't want to part with Annie's spirit... ...which is in that doll. Hendro? What's the matter? -Teacher,... ...we are out of gas. Oh, come on! We'll wait here. Assistance. Let's go there, Riana. Don't. -Why, Riana? But that's our only hope. Come on. Come on. Something is wrong... ...with this place. Mister, can you help us? Sorry. We're closed. All our employees have gone home. But our car broke down and we need..... Madam, just come back tomorrow. -But we need petrol. I can't help you. Anggi, come on. Riana! Anggi! Teacher, you can't help me. Laila? Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Laila? Laila? Please stop, Laila. Please. You can't help me. You can't help me. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. Teacher, you can't help me. Laila,... ...please listen to me. You're not crazy... ...and I believe that you can see the future. Please stop, alright? And this is my future, Teacher. I can't escape it! Laila? Laila! Anggi? Riana. You are a bad daughter. -A bad daughter. You are a bad daughter. -You are a bad daughter. You are a bad daughter. You set your house on fire. You are the cause of Uncle Johan's death, Riana. You have caused chaos in this family. You made your mother fall down the stairs. You caused her to be hospitalised, Riana. You caused them to have an accident, Riana. A bad daughter! -You are a bad daughter,... ...a bad daughter. -You are a bad daughter! A bad daughter! You are a bad daughter. -Bad daughter. Perhaps they have to turn into dolls,... ...so you could love them. Isn't that so, Riana? You only love dolls, right? Dolls, right? Dolls, right? Dolls, dolls, dolls. Dolls, dolls, dolls, dolls, dolls. Dolls, dolls, dolls, dolls, dolls. Riana. Riana. Riana. -Riana, I'm here, my child. I'm here. -Riana, when were you born? Riana! Riana! -Riana. You're very good. -Riana! Yes, good. Very good. -Hi! Hi, Riana! Riana! -Riana. Hi, Riana. -Riana. Riana! -Hi! Riana. -Riana. Riana! Help me, Riana! -Riana, help! Help! Riana, help! Riana! Riana, help me! Riana! Riana! Riana? -Help! Help me, Riana! Riana! -Riana! Help! Riana! Riana! Help me, Riana! Riana! Help me, Riana! Help! Hand over Riani! Hand over Riani! Hand her over. -Hand over Riani. Hand over Riani. -Hand her over. Hand over Riani. Hand her over, hand her over. -Hand over Riani. Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. -Hand her over. Hand her over. -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. -Hand her over. Hand over Riani, hand over Riani! -Hand over Riani! Hand over Riani, hand over Riani,..... Teacher? Open your eyes, wake up. Teacher? Why are you sleeping here? Where is Riana? Where is Riana? Come on, let's go find her. Come on. Riana? Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. -Hand her over. Hand her over, hand her over,..... -Riani, don't give up! Hand her over, hand her over. -Riana! Don't listen to them, Riana. -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. -Don't ever blame yourself... ...for everything that happened in your life. Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. -Those in the mirrors,... ...they all love you. -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. They will never harm you. -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. We'll always support you, Riana. -Hand her over. Love yourself! -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. This is not my fault nor is it Riani's fault. Hand her over, hand her over. -This is not my fault... ...nor is it Riani's fault. -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. Go! Go away all of you! -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. And don't take Riani from me! -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. Hand over Riani, hand over Riani, -Hand over Riani, hand over Riani. Destroy all the mirrors, Riana! Riana! Riana! Bava Gogh! You will not hurt anymore children! Do not hurt my children! Do not hurt my children! Do not hurt them! Do not hurt them! Do not hurt them! Hendro. Riana, Riana, let's get out of here. Come on. Anggi, you go on ahead. Riana. Riana! Riana, let's get out of here! Riana! Riani! Riana, come on! Let's go. -Riani! Riana! -Riani! Riana, come on! -Riani! Riani! -Come on! Riani!
