Born I was but how when or where I cannot say So I leave it up to you to believe it, if you will. You will perceive that I am not a common flea, and if you wonder how it came to pass that in my walk in life, or perhaps I should have said "my jump," I possess the learning and power to describe the facts I'm about to relate. I can only remind you that there are intelligences that existence of which are not yet been detected by the scientific world. I have head it remarked that I make make my living by blood-sucking. My reply is that the flea is not the lowest in the universal fraternity of bloodsuckers. At least I give a warning to the body in which i feed. That is seldom done by others in my profession. As to my story, she was a beauty, just 14 Alothough so young, Her soft bosom was already blooming into those proportions which delight the opposite sex Her face was charming in its frankness Her breath, as sweet as the perfumes of Arabia And I have always said, her skin soft as velvet She was evidently well aware the good looks and carried her head is proudly and coquettishly as a queen. Although a flea cannot blush, we can observe, and I have taken it upon by myself to commit to pen and ink all those amatory passages in my experience which I think may interest the seeker after truth. Closely watching everything I noted the swelling thighs which spread upwards to where only fleas can dare to tread. My curiosity has been aroused, and my desire to know more of the interesting young being with whom chance has so promiscuously brought me in pleasing contact. Prompted me to remain quietly ensconced in a snug though somewhat moist hiding place. So believe me if you will I was engaged upon professional business connected with the plump fight leg of a young lady some 14 years of age. The taste of whose blood I well remember and the flavor of whose... [slurping sounds] Ah, Belle, so succulent, but I am digressing She was with her aunt. Intimacy was out of the question there. I do not make it my policy to read the correspondence of others, but my curiosity had been aroused. So at an appropriate moment I took the liberty to read: "I will be waiting for you at the old spot after church" You don't know how I love you Belle Yes I do Charlie, you are always telling me. I shall get tired of hearing it soon When are you going to show me all those funny things you told me about? Now, Now! dear Belle. While we have the chance to be alone. You know Belle, we are no longer children Well, there are things which are not known to children which are necessary for lovers not only to know but also to practice as well -Dear me! Yes, secret things which make lovers happy and make them enjoy loving and being loved Lord, how sentimental you've grown Charlie. I remember the time when you said it was all humbug Oh, so I thought it was Till I loved you -Nonsense But go on. Tell me about the things you promised me. O but I can't tell you without showing you as well Well go on then, show me. Aah, Charlie! Ahh, Charlie, what is it you are doing? Touching me! The next moment, Belle grasped the new and delicious object Those of you who been placed in a similar position will readily understand her look of surprise Belle saw a man's member for the first time in her life And although it was not by any means of formidable one You're an imputent boy! What is it you've done? What lengths have your mad and savage passion carried you? As for you, you miserable girl! Forgetful of the precepts of the holy mother church you've allowed this wicked and presumptuous boy to pluck your forbidden fruit! What will become of you now? Daughter of lust, given up on the sin, the Satan. Have mercy on me! Spare me Father Confessions are to no avail Humiliations do but add to your offense My mind... misgives to me as to my duty in this said affair. But if I were to follow my present inclinations I should go directly to your natural guardians and aquaint them with my infamous discovery. I will do anything! -Yes we will do anything! Enough! I must have time. I must invoke the assistance of the Blessed Virgin for who knew no sin, but who without the mortal delights of mortal copulation give birth to the babe of babes in the manger of Bethlehem Amen At 2'oclock tomorrow I shall expect you. I will then unfold to you the divine will concerning your transgressions And as for you rash youth I shall likewise expect you the following day When I will then unfold to you the divine will concerning your transgressions, until then your secret is safe with me. Peace be with you My thirst for knowledge kept me in her vicinity. I wish to learn the sequel of this adventure, and I took care not to annoy her with any ill timed attack on my part. I will not attempt to tell the miserable period spent by my young protégé between the shocking discovery made by the Holy Father Ambrose and the hour assigned for the interview in the sacristy, which was to decide the fate of the the unfortunate Belle. You've done right my daughter to come to me so punctually. I have thought much and prayed much on your account For sometime there apeared to be no way in which I could absolve my conscience in this affair other than to go directly to your uncle and lay before him my dreadful secret. But I'm wounded to think of the results of such a disclosure. I have invoked the assistance of the Blessed Virgin, She has shown to me away which while it serves the precepts of our holy mother church will also prevent your offense from being known to your uncle. Not the first necessity which this course imposes is implicit obedience. The things with the servants of the church are forbidden to openly to avow but which they have sufficient need to satisfy There are a select few chosen to assuage the earthly desires of our religious community To you Belle I confer this holy office Thus not only will your sins be forgiven, But you will swim in a sea of sensual pleasure. Without incurrening the penalties of your intense emotions. Oh who would have believed I could have been chosen for such pleasure Sweet innocent, it will be for me to instruct you It's time to lift the veil from the real character this man, I do so with respect, but the truth must be told. Father Ambrose was the living personification of lust And he had planned the meeting of the two lovers while he watched in hiding close by Oh! A beautiful thing, and an immense one too! Stay a moment If you continue to rub it so, I will spend To spend? What is that Father? To spend, to spend is to complete the act of loving by a rich quantity of thick white fluid will escape from that thing which you are now hold your hands. Will this give you relief father? Undoubtablly my darling. What is the fluid called? It has various names according to those that employ them, but between you and I we shall just call it spunk Spunk? Spunk is the word I wish you to know it by. You shall presently have a plentiful amount. How must I receive it Father? Instead of discharging my spunk into your tight little belly What the extreme tightness of that little slit of yours would cause it to flow over abundantly We will commence with the friction of your obedient fingers. When you feel the approaches spasms, you would have take as much as possible of the head of this affair between your lips or I will then to scourge my raging spunk tll the last drop is expended But you told me Father that the tightness of this little slit with make you spend Oh what I will not give to fell that fierce thing in my belly, to taste that spunk up in me Enough Belle, I must have you Remove everything that could interfere with our movements... Finally she was his, and his alone It was evident how much the beauty of the young Belle inflamed the sensual nature of the priest. Despite his calling, Father Ambrose was in reality devoted to the pursuit of lecherous desires. His animal instincts and his vigourous constitution made him resemble in body as in mind the saytar of old. And then Belle's clerical admirer buried himself within her until the very hairs met. My arms are around you, my weapon's all ready I'm way up inside you Ohh, give me the delicious thing up as far as you can Come on Father Father Ambrose! This is against all rules and privileges You know all such games shall be in common. Yes I saw you walk through the keyhole But you need now worry my dear, we won't hurt you. Wont we? - All the same Tell you what I've got Only perhaps the delicious moss rose was too sweet for you my friend Stay a moment If you must haver her at least let her undress without tearing her clothes the pieces Belle, It seems we all must share you So we hear the coming instrument by united pleasure Oh Father! Oh it's so deep Father! Oh, its swelling in you, its swelling. Oh let me see your spunk We shall see it soon enough -Deeper, deeper -so deep so hot Oh its so hot Oh Father, of fuck that Oh Father! The moment I wanted you in confession I've seen you and the sex and wanted you and now I have you Belle, Belle deep with in you. Ah, yes my child, yes, yes... Oh, I spend! Fleas are a bad measurers of size and space and I forbear to give any exact dimensions of the weapon on which Belle now cast her eyes. Suffice to say it was gigantic Will I ever get that great thing into my poor little person? Don't worry my child. I will be careful. I will be gentle. However, youth is elastic, or so they say. Father.... Oh, my daughter!, Oh I come! Let us fuck some more. Holy Moses! Amen If this beautiful child is to satisfy all three of us we must proceed in an order For myself I do not care if I've come first or second but As Ambrose spends like an ass I propse to pass first. Certainly Clement must be content with the second or third place. I went third last time I do not see why I must always go last I claim second place. Good. Let it be so. You have rose and will follow third. I master Kamit it has a second visit His enormous men will not only split her into two, it spoil all my pleasure Ha! I will atack by the breach Who follows me is of no consequence There's a new experience I must now instruct you in my daughter But first you will find it more productive of pain than pleasure. I know my duty Father I'm one of the chosen ones Oh! You're going in the wrong space! I draw a veil over the scenes of lust which followed. As I had a certain feeling of friendship as well as sympathy for the young girl. Three days after these events, Belle made her appearance in her uncle's drawing-room and thus I found means to overhear the conversation In short Ambrose went to her uncle and related how he had discovered Bell and her young lover in Cupid's alliance He well knew the character the man with whom he was dealing Monsieur Verbouc's eyes had long been cast upon his niece. They would share the prize between them. There must be no silly resistance men This good Father has sanctified the operation And therefore I must possess and enjoy your body as your imprudent young companion has already done. [Screaming indistinctly] You Cannot! You cannot! You Cannot! You must be quite Belle! You must indeed submit I will enyjoy you by force if you do not allow me to do so otherwise. Easy. Easy. Fight, oh, come on! There!, Oh your pretty legs! I feel you, you exquisite calves. Soft lucious thighs May hold still little fool -Are you going mad! Yes, Belle, I am mad Mad with passion for you Mad with fuck to posess you, to enjoy you .. myself upon your body Oh don't hurt me! Never have I longed so ardently to contribute to the discomfort of another bloodsucker I hopped to her rescue I will spare you the dialogue that follows It related only to female dogs with whom I share a close affinity That night, I accompanied the unfortunate to her boudoir for a well-deserved rest Our nerves not received a dreadful shock I found a deliciously warm and secure retreat amid the soft and tender moss of Belle when at midnight, I recognize the person of Monsieur Verbouc Then follow a struggle in which both played a distinct part The ravisher, fired by the difficulties of his conquest and Belle... I sensed a change in her which she neither cared nor sought to analyze No, No, Stop! -Don't stop -Belle, young childlike and So lately innocent had suddenly become a woman of violent passions. Now she lusted for hump without limit or bounds of decency Belle had a female friend, the daughter of a wealthy gentleman A flea cannot well be supposed to describe human beauty even in those on whom they feed. All I know is the Julia Delmont was a luscious treat to me. Her father was a man of means Her mother was a weak simpleton who busied herself very little about her daughter, or indeed, her husband Monsieur Delmont was comparatively young, he was robust, he was fond of life, And his tastes were decidedly lustful Under these circumstances it was no wonder this has eye should have fallen on the budding and beautiful figure of his daughter's young friend Belle, wiser and more experienced than most 14 year old girls saw that he was only awaiting an opportunity to push matters to extremities I have already related the character of Father Ambrose So you will not be surprised to learn that he had determined that the young Julia would also be his to accomplish this end he conceived the plot which I... as a humble insect I've never known to be equal. Accordingly Belle set to work to corrupt her young friend. How she succeeded we show duly see. Pardon me. If I ravage Julia without preparation, I'll burst her parts. I cannot take her first I need the excitement of previous a copulation An idea occurs to me. Which gives me a violent erection just to think... Put into pracice it would be the acme of lust, concequently of pleasure Let me hear. Well, Monsieur Delmont is amitus of our child here who is now sucking my weapon. Now Belle, give me your attention. Belle! Belle, for the moment stop sucking my tool -This is my plan - Let me hear You will allow Delmont to declare himself and suggest that for a certain sum to be agreed upon, Your uncle will surrender his virgin niece I hardly know about that You will be sold to Delmont You'll be allowed to take his fill of your charms in secrecy He will behold the body, utterly nude of a beautiful young girl and he shall enjoy her. Now she shall not see him, nor he her At least not the face, which shall remain concealed I don't see the object. We'll be no nearer our goal. Don't you understand? Monsieur Delmont shall violate his own daughter in place of Belle. When he's fallen into our trap and informed of his incest, and return for his daughter reward him with the real enjoyment Oh sweet Belle Belle's aunt, Madame Verbouc, whom you met at the opening of my history, occupied a chamber by herself. Only 32 summers had passed over that Pious and devout head And in spite of her piety, she sometimes desired the more solid comforts of her husband Pierre's cock Now it's so happened that on this particular evening, Father Clement had posted himself near the house to watch a certain window which he thought was that of the fair Belle How vain are human calculations. While the forelorn Clement was approaching one chamber The object of his desires was enjoying two lovers in another. Belle? Pierre! Oh Pierre! Pierre? Oh? Pierre! It was several days before poor Madame Verbouc was well enough to leave her bed The shock to the delicate pussy have been dreadful It was not long before Belle found herself within the mansion of Monsieur Delmont And as lady luck would have it, or shall we say, as Belle expressly designed it They were alone Oh how rude you are! What a naughty thing I cannot let you do that. Nobody must be allowed to touch that. Not until they... Not until they what, Belle? Oh I must not tell you I ought to have said nothing about But by doing such a good thing you would forget Forget what? Oh, something my uncle oft told me. What is it Tell me I dare not. besides ... I do not understand what he means I will explain it if you tell me what he said Do you promise not to tell? Certainly! Well, uncle said, you must never let anyone put their hands there And whoever does so must pay well for it. Does he really say that? Yes indeed. There are plenty of rich gentlemen who would pay well for what you want to do to me And he says he's not stupid enough to loose it to chance. Really? What is man of business your uncle must be. Oh yes, he is very fond of money. I scaresly know what he means when he says he will sell my maidenhead. It is possible. What a man he must be. What's a wonderful eye ... .. for business you must have An interruption occurred in the arrival of his own daughter Julia, and reluctantly he had to release his companion. Belle made a rapid excuse and went home, leaving the events To take its check Something in your eyes The route taken by the fair young lady lay through a large meadow, Where a cow and a bull were engaged in ahh, nothing frivolous. But I am decided to let your imagination supply the details if that natural intimacy Well I jumped ahead to two more pertinant beasts of the field. Ah, imagination Men's body is faulty, his mind untrustworthy, but his imagination has made him remarkable. Oh my goodness, you wicked man! Oh gum! What were you doing with that long red thing? Did you see what those ponies were doing in the meadow? Yes I did, what were they doing it for? Well, the boy wanted the girl and the girl wanted the boy So they came together and fucked! Let me put my hands up your clothes Not now I'm in a hurry Say when you will come again Someday perhaps, but not now! I must be getting home Where do you live Not far from here but if you try to follow me it will be the worse for you. Why don't we fuck like the cows? Tell me, have you ever fucked? No. But I should like to Don't you believe me? Well then yes I have Father and I fucked the girls together You and your father? Yes When we get the chance You should see his fuck, all of God Oh You don't seem a clever boy Oh, but I know how to fuck now Though I only had it once You should see me Who did you do it with? A little girl of 14 Father and I both fucked her and split her up -fourteen? -yes I caught her, father caught me So that he wanted his go and he made me hold her You should see him fuck. Oh come what a frick mover Thats father, aint he a horny one? Ah, how do you? I would like to fuck you The boy would like to fuck you too So stay and be fucked! Oh! let me go. All right! All right, all right! I want you to see father's cock You ought to see his cod too See? Oh gum! Oh goodness, what is that you pouring into me? That's the spunk that's what that is. Didn't I tell you he's a good in the fuck? Goodness me your not going to put that into me are you? I am though. Father rubs me I mean to fuck you Oh, its dreadfully long. Its all way up my belly Ain't she a beauty boy? Oh give it to her boy! Father, don't talk I can't fuck What a tight little cunt she's got, ain't she boy! I can't spend Its so wrong of us. I jerk it so much that he misses it Oh gum! That was fun wasn't it Didn't I tell you we were good in the fuck? Yes, indeed But you must let me go now Alright Everything has a moral, if only you can find it At length the day arrived the eventful morning broke, when the beautiful Julia Delmont was to lose that coveted treasure which is so eagerly sought on the one hand, and often so thoughtlessly thrown away I found the other. I know you have something to tell me Belle what is it? Can't you guess? Is it anything about father Ambrose? Oh I feel so awkward when I see him now and yet he told me there was no harm in what he did. But what did he do? Oh, he told me such things and then he put his arm around my waist and kissed me to the almost took my breath away. He said and did a thousand things until I thought I was going out of my senses Tell me some of them Well how can I tell you? He put his fingers down my dress, making me feel as I had never felt before I thought I was going to faint -Did you like it? -Of course I did. Come Julia, that was not all. He did not stop there Of course he didn't But I can't tell you what he did. Don't be sad child Why not tell me everything Well it seems so shocking, but if I must. After he made me feel as if I were dying of a delicious shivering sensation, he suddenly took my my hand And placed it upon something that felt like child's arm I saw a great red thing with a funny round purple top, like a plum. This thing grew out from between his legs and it was covered below with a great mass of curly hair. He kept my hand upon it making me rub it over and over, over and over It was so large and stiff and hot I felt so frightened when I saw how his eyes glared And his breathing grew hard and quick. He reassured me and called me his dear child, and made me fondle the stiff thing in my bosom. He asked me to open my lips, and rub the top between them A mosture came at once upon my tongue and in an instant a thick gush of warm fluid ran into my mouth. I was still playing with it when the noise of a door opening oblidged the good Father to put away what I had a hold of. He said it is not for the common people to know what you know or do what I permit you to do His manner was so kind and obliging And he made me think that I was quite different from all the other girls But tell me Bell what is this mysterious news you have. I'm dying to know Know then, that Father Ambrose has arranged for you to be initiated at once He has provided for it here today Oh I shall be so ashamed so dreadfully shy Oh no my dear. All of that has been thought of. Only Father Ambrose could have arranged everything so perfectly You make me blush Belle. But how? It will be in a nice little chamber we have You will be laid upon a bed And your head will be concealed by a curtain, so that only your naked body will be exposed For shame, naked too? Oh, Julia My dear tender Julia Evidently The plot was about to thicken, because later on that day Monsieur Verbouc and his dear friend and neighbor, Monsieur Delmont agreed on a settlement. One had sold his niece, the other believe he had purchased that precious jewel, a maidenhead The bargain was to be executed forthwith. Monsieur Delmont was to take possession of that's delicious virginity had so longed to destroy Only a door stood between Him and the victim of his lust Who that victim really was he had not the remotest idea. He thought only of Belle Ye gods what what a sight the body of a young girl naked as the day she was born. it would take several minutes to go over in detail and discover all all the separate merits of each delicious limb All indeed was there except the head. That member was conspicuous by its absence. And then, oh then, the central spot of man's desire When Nature loves to revel when she springs and whither she returns unfurled. The source. Ladies and gentlemen I am only a flea Yet, fleas have feelings, and what mine were when I saw that excited member close to the pouty lips of Julia's moist slit I will not attempt to describe The sexual instincts of the male flea rose within me and I closed my eyes I longed, yes I longed to be in Monsieur Delmont's place. What? What is all this? Oh heavens I made such a dreadful mistake! Tell me for pity sake, what mistake? -Who then is this? -Oh come! Oh what I have done? Speak you Who is that? It was not my fault! How could I know it was you they brought here for me. Not knowing I substituted Julia Hush, she knows nothing of it. It was all a mistake. A dreadful mistake and nothing more If you are to support it, it was all my fault and not yours I never thought for a moment that it was going to be you. Was very unkind of them not to have told me. What if they should find out? What if they should find out? Oh my goodness! What is this? Oh my monsiur, be gentle with me. Oh my goodness how you touch me Oh heavens! What are you doing? Hush! Do not incriminate yourself Better suffer than ... there is such a thing as incest. O man of lust Here is the state in which we found your daughter What if she should be found with child? We must prevent that at all cost. Nothing less that a second emission from another man can make such a thing positively safe She shall have it. That is certain After you Mine at last To avoid a repetition of the violent emotions which overwhelmed the actors in this monstrous scene I jump ahead to the calmer moments when our attention was directed to Monsieur Delmont You see Delmont, there is pleasure in the line of duty If Father Ambrose and I had had not... There is no knowing what problem might have followed. -Nothing like.. -doing the right thing Eh Delmont? I don't know I feel ill I mean... kind of a dream I don't I don't I don't doubt your friendship, your secrecy. Look I am still excited I... I don't know I don't know what I want My friends, what am I to do? Thanks for the girl Monsieur Delmont and his lolling love lance were apparently overcome with wine or women or possibly both And they subsided into a corner and appeared to be dozing A thousand pleasantries now took place Father Ambrose who's sensual character thoroughly predominated owned one other weakness, and that's was preaching On this occasion he delivered the sermon which I found impossible to follow So I went to sleep in Belle's armpit until he finished. Stop a moment Shall I change with you my friend? The dear's lovely On no, I cannot stop I can only go on as I am This dear child is perfect Eh, Delmont? When in trope the bottoms a madien? A velvet derrière Come my friend. Now it's your turn. Here's a treat for you Try some of this What is the matter with you? He's dead and so he was. Monsieur Delmont has paid his debt to nature as the phrase goes. Sudden death is so common. I suppose it was due to organic deterioriation of some sort. As for me I went about as usual, except that for a change I fancy Julia's legs They had a more pungent flavor than Belle's and I accordingly bled them. And what would be more natural than the Julia should pass much of her time with her dear friend, Belle. Oh I thought I would die when father when Father Ambrose pushed that great big thing of his up into my little belly. And then when he finished... Hush Holy massive prince What does he want? Don't be alarmed. He won't eat us. Or maybe he will We shall soon see what he wants. What is it possible? A double treat? Delightful The shame Father Clement coming in here without permission Shall I go then You can stay now that you're here The orgies of that lascivious night, are past my powers of description The dawn alone put an end to the monstrous scene of debauchery. But while such things were passing in the house A very different sort was approaching the Chamber of Monsieur Verbouc. When three days afterwards, Ambrose return from an absence to find his friend and fellow conspirator at the point of death His widow, never very intellectual began to develop symptoms of insanity And she perpetually called for the priest When an aged Father was summoned, the good lady denied he could be a priest and demanded the one with the big tool. You aren't the priest I asked for I wanted the priest that I asked for. You aren't he! Bring him to me You are not the one I wanted Bring me the one that I wanted! Where is he? Give him to me The language and behavior having scandalized all She was later incarcerated in an asylum and there continued to rave for the big prick. Belle left without protectors, readily leant an ear among other orifices, to the solicitations of dear Father Ambrose and was persuaded to take the veil. Julia I was determined to share her friend's fate, and so on the same day both girls were received into the arms of the holy mother church Both took the vows of chastity. How their vows of chastity were kept, it is not for me a humble flea to expand upon. I only know that after the the ceremony was over both girls were privately conveyed to a monastery where 14 priest eagerly awaited them with tilted cassocks Shocked by such a sight, and appalled beyond measure by visions of the orgy which would surely follow, I fled I never stopped until I put some miles between myself and the actors of this hateful drama And if it is out of my power as a flea to point tomorrow, it is not beyond my ability to choose greener pastures I emigrated as many are doing who although they are not fleas are nevertheless as I reminded you in the beginning of my tale, BLOODSUCKERS!
