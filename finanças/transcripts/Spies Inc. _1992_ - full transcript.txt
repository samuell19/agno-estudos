[ foreign language ] Come on. Go for it, Mac. Orushkin, come on. Let's have it. It's all in here, 43 cables. [ speaking in foreign language ] Let's go! Let's go! [ gunshots ] Hustle, damn it! Hustle! Come on! Come on! VIC: Who is the fireball? LORIMER: McKinley. Our top man in Moressa. And this was his opposite number. Vladimir Orushkin of the KGB. VIC: So this Orushkin crosses over the wild side, huh, just like that? Could be our biggest defection since Yurchenko came over. Yeah? So what did he give us? 43 cables, all from Moscow Central to the Soviet ambassador, Moressa. And? Vic, there's enough going on down there to start world war III, twice. In Moressa? McKinley wants to get this all the way to the top - and fast. - McKinley? That bozo couldn't start a forest fire with a flamethrower. Vic, just take a look at some of this. Oh, come on, Lorimer. Moressa is a farm for freaks and burned-out spooks, theirs, ours, everybody's. God, even you know that. Let me show you something big. We're talking about a reconnaissance satellite which spies with its little eye the People's Republic of Moressa. 19 islands and a couple of atolls. Main island over here. One large town. Rice, rubber, tea, coconuts. Okay, so far? Now, we track over to one of these remote little fellows over here. Tell me what you see. Some kind of a settlement, here. Leper colony, 20 lepers, 2 Dutch nuns and a Sony Walkman, that's it. Only according to Mr. Orushkin's cables, the pics we're getting are phony. Phony? What the hell are you talking about, phony? All they got to do is isolate the satellite's frequencies, difficult but not impossible, and they're in business. They can beam back whatever they want us to see. So what do you want from me? Somebody on a plane within the hour. Somebody who speaks Russian, somebody good, going in deep cover, no embassy contact, and I want him to turn our Mr. KGB Orushkin inside out. You're asking me for a 3T man? That's what they're there for. - What cartons? - What are you saying, Alice? Strawberry again, Mr.-- Mac, important traffic from headquarters. What does it say? Oh, tangerine, of course. How silly of me. They are sending somebody out. Sun Slip will deliver to you right away, Mr. Brenjou. To debrief Mr. Orushkin. Debrief Orushkin? What the hell for? - Thank you. Bye. - We've covered everything! 43 in-depth cables we sent them, 43! - Count them. - Mac! What the hell do they want? We got an Olympic-sized pool of sewage blowing up in our faces! - MAN: Alice? - What'll they say to this? The 6th, the 44th airborne? No, no, no. Some prissy little four-eyed Ivy League fancy Dan who wants to debrief the Russian KGB Orushkin! Alice? Rob, honey. Yeah, I need you to hold this for me. - Where? - Right there. Alice, come on! We got to get our ass in gear. - Shh. - Don't shush me. Any minute now, 3T is gonna be launched in our direction. - He's already on his way. - Licked the sucker. I told you, Mac, everything is gonna be all right. - Yeah? - Yes. I got back to headquarters right away. 3T is under instructions to go straight to his hotel and wait for contact. [ indistinct chattering ] Do you know the Nippon hotel? Absolutely, know damn good, sir. [orn honking ] Nippon hotel, sir. Keep the change. Oh, thanks a lot. Hey, anybody home? [ song playing in foreign language ] Whittaker. Hey! You follow. You're a lucky man. First guest, big fever. He got pukey. Room vacant now. Wonderful view. Aah! [ indistinct chatter ] Whittaker, get in. Come on, get in. Rob Hartman. You're the bang and boom guy. These boys are really up and running, huh? You okay? - Which boys? - KGB, of course. KGB? Yeah, in comes the 3T man, out goes Rob to meet him and what do you know? He's got his death squad in there to hit him. - Shit. - KGB, no way. It's got to be. That's too damn amateur. This is Moressa, buddy. Yeah, even for Moressa. So where you keeping him? Orushkin? Where have you got him? Oh, shit! [ tires screeching ] [ honking ] Did you see that? - Where's the safe house? - The what? Orushkin? Where have you got him? Oh, yeah, Orushkin. He's out of town. Where? Up the coast, a place called Patra. You got an address? No, that's strictly Mac's department. You know how many people he's got down there? Miners. Oh, yeah, yeah, we got about half a dozen. Cream of the crud. These are the best locals we got. Okay, take me to the station. That's right where we're headed. Wrong station, I want the railroad, not the agency. And if I did my homework right, it should be over that way. What the heck you want to go there for? To catch a train. Patra. I'm on assignment, remember. The agency wants this Russian debriefed, and they want it yesterday. Yeah, but, I mean you got any idea about the trains in this place, huh? There's a hotel on Patra Harbor, the Oriental. I'll be there under the name of Harper. Have McKinley get in touch with me through one of his miners. You're not listening to me. I'm talking about the jungle express. For Christ's sake, just hire yourself a car. Better yet, why don't you just come over and take one of ours? You know better than that. Cut through there. - There! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. [ honking ] Damn, take it easy. Slow down. Now look at what you've gone and done. - What I've done? - Now just sit still. Only one way to handle this. You, get out of there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come here. Do you realize what you just did? - Please, it was an accident. - Accident, my ass. You deliberately threw this piece of junk under my wheel. Now you take it and you get out of here before I sue you for everything you've got. Come on, party is over. Get out of here. Don't worry. Stuff like that happens here all the time. Turn it off. - What are you talking about? - I said turn it off. Now listen. I'm Harper, Oriental Hotel, Patra. You got that? - This goes to headquarters. - What the heck is this? My first on-site report. So long. - Hey, where you going? - Train station, on foot. What the hell is bugging you? Hartman, I can't afford the advertising. Sir, wait a minute, my friend will take you to the hospital. - Hospital? - Just a check-up. Not to worry, sir. All in one piece. Can't be too sure. Come on, please. Uh-uh, Whittaker, no, I ain't taking-- The hell you are. Hey, what did I tell you? - You get out of here. - You'll do it, Hartman. You'll take good care of him or the company will hear about it. Oh, yeah? Don't forget, it's your company, too, buddy. It's not the damn Boy Scouts, you understand? You're on assignment, remember? Deep cover, man! You're very kind, sir. [ car honking ] Where the hell have you been? How the hell did you find me? - I find anybody. Sources. - Sit down. Do you realize I was about to make a speech and that the president was there? [ocking ] Do you realize I was about to make a speech-- We got a problem, Cleague. A major problem. May I suggest we discuss it in more congenial surrounding? Your inner sanctum, Mac? Why don't you invite us there before we all go down with cholera or something worse. Balls on this guy. A top-secret United States government facility. Oh, for heaven's sake. Off-limits to commies and fruitcakes. Fruitcakes? Please! Her Majesty's fruity secret service. - You got the wrong country. - Was and it always will be. It's about time some of yours came out of the closet. Huh? People, people, please do something. Time flies. Shut up and sit down. Sit. What will it be, Cleague? I don't suppose you have a banana daiquiri with an umbrella, do you? No, I don't suppose we do. Give me something hermetically sealed. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll have some gin with a dash of tonic. An unopened bottle if you don't mind. Will you cut the crap and listen? I'm all ears. What's the problem? Triple threat. - I beg your pardon. - The 3T. Oh, so that's what it stands for. Triple threat. Love it. Well, that was taken care of. That was all taken care of. It was a matter of timing. The kid, he checks in. And Rob, he makes the call, and what happens? I don't know. Mac, I'd give anything to see one of your reports. - No way. - Nothing hush-hush. Just a sample of your prose. What Edwin's trying to tell you-- - Don't call me that. - It's on your dossier. Not to put too fine a point on it, comrade Rob fouled up. - What? No way. - Fouled up? And our friend, Mr. 3T-- [ all arguing at once ] Five days, that's all we have. Five days to shake the world, and you let the wildcard go? You show me one Brit or a commie who'll do any better. I'm telling you. this kid is red hot. And very much alive. Yeah? Well, not long he ain't. See, old Rob, he did some quick thinking. Next thing you know, our boy is out of town before his feet even touch the ground. Out of town? He's gone to interview the KGB defector. - Where? - Patra. - We don't have anybody there. - It's your territory, Arthur. Who've you got up there? Hey, hey, what about the princess? She's strictly off limits. [ thunder rumbling ] See, I've-- I've got a singing leper, I've got the porter of the Oriental hotel. Beautiful. You guys get your asses down there tonight. You give this to the porter, he delivers it by hand to Mr. Harper, AKA, Whittaker. Tonight? - Well, what is this? - Directions to the safe house. [mitates explosion ] And Mr. 3T is history. Yes, well, let's hope this time he is history. I's and T's dotted and crossed. Oh, dotted and crossed, old boy. Well, if that's all settled, Miss Kibblewhite, Orushkin. Edwin. [ whistles ] Hey, Orushkin, hold for a second. Sit down. We got work to do. Work? Mr. 3T's first in-depth report to headquarters. We have to dummy up something real good, or else our collective tit is in the wringer. You're the KGB defector. Talk to us. [inging ] [ knocking on the door ] Yeah? Breakfast, sir. For you, sir. From Starburst. You know where he is? Oh, no, sir. [ indistinct ] Where's the transport? Queen of the Orient, sir. Down there, at the end of the jetty. [ speaking in foreign language ] [aughter ] And Whittaker thinks it's lasers? Yes, sir. It's all in his report. - You go with this? - I do now, sir. Your 3T boys never get it wrong. Sir, Whittaker picked the Russian empire three times, and the pieces always fitted back together. This guy Orushkin is on the level. What about the think tank? They all go with Whittaker, sir. They're convinced we're talking worst-case scenario. Ground base free electron lasers. Electronic railguns, particle beam decoy discriminators, you name it. If it's Star Wars, the Russians have got it. And that's just the beginning, sir. - It gets worse? - Much worse. If the Russians have got the technology to give us a phony redoubt on Moressa, then where the hell else? I can't go to the President with this. - Sir, we've got an-- - The implications. - We have, sir. Whittaker says that-- - But are you sure? - Yes, sir. Then get me something hard. Who's running this outfit? What the hell does it look like? Get back to Whittaker. Tell him I want pictures and a name. - Pictures? - Of the laser station. He's a trained pilot, isn't he? Then pouch him in Ultralight, two, three. If a bunch of Palestinians can get in under the radar in those damn things, so can Whittaker. Get me a beer. We got a problem. They're sending someone up. Worse. They want proof, pictures of the meeting. Pictures of the laser station. How are we gonna get there? By sending the kid a couple of airplanes. This is ridiculous. There's nothing to photograph. No shit, Sherlock, and they want a Russian, too. Orushkin, you got anybody on your side even down at the island, somewhere? Somebody that we can palm off for setting up the operation? Maybe. No, no maybe. You got to have somebody. There was someone before my time. I'm afraid he was lost. - Huh? - It happens sometimes. Central planning. What was his name? I think it was Filatov. He got a first name? Ivan. Ivan Filatov. Will his name show up on our computers? [ speaks Russian ] But the photographs, they'll be more difficult. No kidding. Chu Chu. [ speaks Russian Our brother in the Cuban services. - That's our man. - Chu Chu Rodriguez? I'm not working with that tamale. The Da Vinci of miniatures, Mac. Cuba and Castro-- it's a matter of principle. Beggars can't be choosers. Nope, absolutely no. How do you approve this guy? Chu Chu, Chu Chu, we're talking big bucks here. [ speaking in foreign language ] Hundreds and hundreds of millions dollars, not pesos. Look, let me explain it to you. Chu Chu, Chu Chu, listen to me, listen to me. You got the upside and you got the downside, we're gonna go up on the downside. Don't you understand? Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Please, please. Comrade Chu Chu, capitalists have many ways of speculation. There are ordinary shares and preference shares and bonds and guilds, and there are futures, where they gamble on what is going to happen. In the future. [ speaking Russian ] Now, the great beauty about the future is you can lay your bets either way. You can gamble on the stock market rising or falling. We are going for a fall. And for a fall, we need a crisis. [ train whistle ] A world crisis, actually. Black Monday times ten. And before we can say Perestroika, we hit the jackpot. - And when it's all done, we-- - Spit! All we have to do is raise 1% of the value of the contract. It's called buying an auction. [ speaks Spanish ] We've done it, dear boy. Vladimir, Mac and myself have pooled our operating funds to raise the deposits. Quite simple, actually. Sacrifice and cooperation, the spirit of the great patriotic war. America, England, Mother Russia. Let's cut the bullshit. We're gonna cut you in for-- - 5%. - 5%? 5 million on every 100 million. No. God Almighty. You want a world crisis? Take your pick. You don't need me. This guy's got shit for brains. Please. Comrade Chu Chu, it is the scale of the crisis and the timing, particularly the timing. You see how we've slightly jumped the gun. We thought that we'd sent enough disinformation to headquarters to start a fire, but they've been rather slow to respond. Comrade, we've already bought the contract. The auction falls due in 4 days. Four days and the clock is ticking. Four days, it's all we've got. So we either have a world crisis and a very large profit for everybody-- Or we're at the creek without a paddle! Come on, what do you say? 5%. [ speaks Spanish ] No! No! No! No, it's... - They're gonna find out. - Sure, they're gonna find out! A week and a month, you cashed in. What the hell do you care if they found out? I care plenty. I care prison, I care worse. In the last 20 years, you ever hear of a spook sitting in the slammer?! Comrade, you must not worry about prison. Maybe a week or so and always a little trip to the border, well, not theirs, for one of ours and everybody's happy. That's the beauty of our profession. We pull all the stings, governments are terrified of us. They're scared out of their skulls. With the amount of money we're talking about, justice melts. You could start a third world war. Five percent, billions, no questions, no taxes, no shit, and you're bothering about World War III! [ speaking foreign language ] [ honking ] Move it! Open up! No, sir. Open up, goddammit! It is a lockout, sir. Alice. Alice? Alice? What's with the lights? Oh, shit. What are you doing sneaking up on me like that? I could have-- you know, my balance. - What's going on? - Shut down. They cut off all the electricity and the water. And I've had to fire the entire staff. Oh, shitheads. They didn't know what electricity was - until we told them. - What do you expect? You haven't paid a utility bill in over a year. All I needed was a few dollars from the operational fund, but oh, no. Come on, Alice, not that again. Sun Slip was the only front company in the whole sector that was turning in a profit. A prosperous expanding business. Will you shut up about Sun Slip and bring that candle over here? Ask that stripper. I know what your trouble is, Alice. You've got no sense of proportion. You're in the big time now. So think big. What the fuck? - I told you, it's all down. - All of it? Everything, except the phone. Well, I got to drive up to the headquarters, flash traffic, I got to get through. So we'll use the embassy. Oh. Aren't you the smartest little bimbo to come down the pike? What the hell would I do without you? You get your sweet ass in there and we're gonna cook up something good. All right. Code, Cosmic. - Okay? - Sure. All right. Reference, Redcoat, source, Starburst. To, UPS/RP. From, 3T-GWMR. Text... Okay. Ground base laser. Mac, what are you trying to tell them? Well, we got our ground base laser station... [ndistinct chatter ] ...out there one of those freaking islands. Okay. What about this? Soviet laser installation, Moressa. Controlled by... um, should we make him colonel? You bet, at least a colonel. Controlled by Colonel Ivan Filatov, deep cover KGB, stop, Whittaker, stop. Okay, scribble it and get your ass to the embassy. What the hell is an Ivan Filatov? [ speaking in foreign language ] Lasers? Filatov. Ivan Filatov. Ivan Filatov! This way, sir. The gentleman sends his compliments, sir. Thank you very much. I'm Jim. Guptin. Oh, meet Hala. - Hi. - How do you do? - That's Marietta. - Hi. - Tabitho, Jodri. - Hi. - Isabelle. - Isabelle. [ foreign language ] Please, sit down. Please. Jodri, get over here. Make room, everybody. That's right, there we are. That was quite a scene this morning at the harbor. You were there? At my window. I imagine you spend a lot of time watching through your window. Well, not really. But when there's a riot going on below, it does kind of draw you there. Hardly a riot. Well, whatever it was, you sure sorted it out. How did you manage that? We Moressans take our women very seriously. Yeah, but Isabelle's a... White? I was born here, Mr. Whittaker. Tell me, what brings you to our little country here? Business? No, just a tourist. Ah, a tourist. Are you enjoying yourself? Terrific. Really? Absolute dynamite. Have you seen anything of the real Moressa? Tourists see only what they want to see. Then perhaps you should learn about it from us. Anytime you'd like to show it to me. Where can I find you? At the water garden. Surely Isabelle's club gets a passing mention in your guidebook. [ speaking in foreign language ] - How about tonight? - I can't make it. - Oh? - Yeah, I've got a date. Tonight? - Someone special? - Not particularly. Just ships passing in the nights. Be careful. I's and T's, old boy. [ indistinct mumble ] [ telephone ringing ] Yeah? ROB: Terminated. 3T is history? Dotted and crossed, old boy. [ speaking in foreign language ] [ folk music playing ] Jim, what are you doing here? You promised me the real Moressa, remember? Let me get you something to drink. No. After this dance. Who are you? A native. The hell you are. Where did you get it all? Dynamite, ships in the night? That wasn't me. I'm sorry for the way that my friends behaved-- What about Whittaker? That was you, wasn't it? Where did that come from? It's your name. Where did you get it? At the hotel register. Nice try, but I booked in under the name of Harper. You got someplace we can talk, privately? Tell me about the things that turn you on, Isabelle. Flirting with dead men. What else? Hi, Jim, over here. Some wine? How delightful. That's not what happened. And all the time you knew damn well well what I was walking into last night. Who you working for? - Who, Isabelle? - Moressa. Oh, come off it. Moressa Intelligence adds up to one retired captain on the wrong side of 70, an assistant librarian with the DTs, both of whom we own. - I didn't say intelligence. - Then who? The country. The people. Don't give me that stuff. - You didn't hear what I said. - Yeah, I heard. Both words. And to you they're hollow? Most times. When they're not, they're dangerous. Except when it's your country and your people. This is my country. I don't care who you are and what you believe. That's your business, but when you and your Moressan buddies try to blow me out of existence, twice, that starts to become my business. It had nothing to do with us. But you knew, all of you. You knew. How? Leave this island for your own sake. They're trying to kill you! - Who's they, Isabelle? - All your lot. And along with them, the KGB, MI6, and goodness knows who else. For one stupid moment I thought I was getting the truth. You are. Do you know who this is? Over there, on the right. It's Cleague, isn't it? Resident Brit. The night you arrived, he came down here with Hartman. That's when he told me about you. You're telling me that Cleague just drops by, discusses classified information... [ clanking ] [ speaking in foreign language ] Come on in, we're just talking about your old pal Cleague. He's one of your kind, not ours. Well, you all look pretty chummy there. That, Mr. Whittaker, was my son's wedding. Twelve weeks later, Cleague had him killed. Your son? How? Car bomb. They put out some story about fundamentalists. How do you know Cleague was involved? Little by little, things came to light, that our old friend Cleague was in fact a British spy, that my son had been working for him, and somewhere somehow he overstepped the mark and... Well, I don't have to tell you how things are worked in your world, do I, Mr. Whittaker? So now you're on the best of terms with the man who killed your husband? The very best. In fact, I work for him. Hold it. You work for Cleague? - I use him. - How? He gets reams of disinformation, we get a window into your world. Dangerous games, lady. And what you learn from Cleague, you pass on to... Any Moressan who needs to know. I need to know, Isabelle. Why are they trying to kill me? That's our boy, sir. Ivan Filatov. When was this taken? June, 1937. I imagine he's changed. According to this, he was posted to Moressa in 1938. Yeah? That's it, sir. That's the whole file. You mean, he's been out there for 50 years? Yes, sir. He hasn't changed post since the Second World War. In fact, he missed the Second World War. This guy is running a ground-based laser station? Yes, sir. He must be one hell of a sleeper. [ car honking ] Where are you going with that stuff? What the hell is going on around here? Hey, you little termite, put that back! Mac! It's all right. It's just old stock. Alice! What the... Has everybody gone crazy? Put back! Alice! Alice? Alice, what the hell is going on? Garage sale. Realizing our assets, Mac. You froze 'em, we're unfreezing them and upping the ante. - Excuse me? - No more rubbers, buddy. We're all out of rubbers. Robby, what's going around? We got to get over to Chu Chu's. Just a minute, Mac. Hey, I told you, get lost! Mac, I want you to meet Mr. Filatov. He wants to defect. For Christ's sake. No defections after 1:00 p.m. Come back tomorrow morning. Come on, Rob, let's... - Did you say Filatov? - Uh-huh. [ whistles ] Hold it a second. Ivan Filatov? It's true. It's me. - And you want to defect? - Defector. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You want to be traitor? You--you want to have that tag for the rest of your life, huh? You're a disgrace to the goddamn communist party! The workers of the world want to throw up their chains and you don't give a hoot and a holler. It's terrible. I can't read this shit, goddamn alphabet. Why can't they even learn to write normal? I've been recalled, recalled to Moscow. Oh, holy camoly, no. They can't do that! No? No! [ indistinct ] Sir! Where do you want these, sir? How the hell do I know? What is it anyway? Emergency drop, sir! Assembled reconnaissance ultra-light, sir! Oh, shove it. Filatov. Filatov, you go there, you make yourself comfortable. Camarilla, she take care of you till we come back. After you, Mr. Filatov. You keep that sucker locked in the basement, you understand? - Uhh. - Go for it! All right, everybody, the show is over! Get your butts out of here! Come on, Rob, let's shake it. Slow down. What are we looking for? Camouflage. Pull over on that side and wait for me. Hey, pal, I'll give you 500 rupees for this thing for the day. You can take this as a deposit. - What's going on? - We are hiring his van. Give me the keys. The man wants collateral. - Jim? - All for the cause, Isabelle. The country and the people. How much time we got? Will you stop that? It's getting obscene. Pick-up in 2 hours, 47 minutes. Orushkin! Orushkin! Come on, let's go! Ta-da! I got to admit, did a good job. All right, let's have a camera. If they don't buy this, they don't buy anything. See if we can get it through the lens. Fire away. All right. How do you plan to get in there? Unnoticed. [ both singing in foreign language ] You got it. Triple threat. Back from the dead. And you're Miss Kibblewhite. I don't believe I've had the pleasure. Filatov. Ivan Filatov. A traitor to the working class. Jim! Thank you. Isabelle. Keep them covered and don't hesitate to use it. Just shut your eyes and think of Moressa. Keys, Miss Kibblewhite? Fantastic. Oh, it's beautiful. So where is the jamming gear for the KH11? Oh, my God, the number one ingredient and it's missing. - Chu Chu! - [oreign language ] You're damn right, there's a problema. Where's the jammer? This equipment is difficult to, to... - Imagine. - Imagine, yes. It's undercover, invisible from the air. - No? - No! If I don't get the photographs on tonight's flight, the agency won't get them in time and worse still, we won't make tomorrow's news! No imagination. Let's solve the problem. Now what are you doing, Rob? [ cross talk ] [ speaking in foreign language ] There you go. What are we waiting for? Let's shoot it. Charlie delta. Charlie delta. I got bogey, that boy. [tammering ] Out of ammo, man. Come on, gentlemen, please. One for me and one for TV. Rob, come on, let's go. Okay, so where are we going? We're gonna interview a defector. I don't believe it. - What is it? - Articles of Incorporation, these guys have got a business going here. The purpose of which shall be commercial transactions and, in particular, to invest in stock market futures. And listen to these shareholders--McKinley, Hartman, Cleague, our Miss Kibblewhite here, Vladimir Orushkin. There's some guy named Chu Chu Rodriguez with an address in Havana. Aren't you in on this? The director? Ta-ta. Defector, me defector. No, he had nothing to do with this. No. Jeez, this is no penny-ante stuff. AT&T, Mitsubishi, Boeing, General Motors. Hundreds of millions-- it's all on the downside. I don't-- I don't understand. Well, it means that they're gambling everything they've got and 99 times more on a falling market. Did I say falling market? I got to hand it to you, Miss Kibblewhite. What are they? Draft cables, all to headquarters and all supposedly from me. Soviet laser installation, Moressa, controlled by Colonel... What did you say your name was? Ivan Filatov. Ivan Filatov. Isabelle, meet the mastermind behind the Soviet version of Star Wars. You mean it's a scam. - There is no crisis. - What? Miss Kibblewhite, I love you. Well, I love you too, honey. What do you think you're doing? Leaving. The hell you are! You can't just leave. Yes, I can. I know what I need to know. - Moressa is not in danger. - Attaboy, princess. Isabelle, do you realize what these lunatics are up to? They're concocting a major international crisis. They've paralyzed everything here. They've ruined the agency cover, they've compromised God knows how many agents and operations. It's gonna be years before we get things back to normal. Normal? What's normal? Bribes, car bombs, surveillance, infiltration? - That's what you call normal? - Right. If they were normal, doing the job they were sent here to do, things will be even worse. She's making good sense. Are you out of your mind? [ distant voices ] - Quick. - No. - Don't think for her. - You know too much. - You listen to yourself. - They'll kill you! You're coming too, pal, we need proof. Please. Ivan! Uh-uh-uh. Stay right there. Mac! Mac! Mac! Triple threat, they've got Ivan! Now the first we've got to do is get him and the file to the embassy as soon as it opens. You know any place we can go to ground for 5 hours. - Well, maybe we could try-- - I have a better idea. The last place in the world they'd think to look for me. First guest, very sick, he got pukey. Then come America, boom. Here you go. Yeah, that's the problem with Americans. They all look the same. That loony Russian is gone, the file is gone. The kid's alive and kicking. Cleague got the film on the flight. Yes, 3T is a loose cannon. Cleague is right, Rob. You messed up, you better do something. - Like what? - How the hell do I know? Sling those airplanes together, we might need them. No, not you. Hey, you tell me, wise guy. Oh, dammit, Cleague, we're finished. - You know what I mean. - Mac. Here's what you do. You set up tag teams at the airport, then head straight back to town, you tell Vlad and his boys to cover the post office and the telephone exchange, inside and out. Yeah. Bulgarians, Czechs, get them all in. We need the Cubans as well. You have Chu Chu and his goons. Excuse me, his companeros. Check out the hotels. Mac and I'll take care of the embassy and the cops. I think they're looking for us. This might take a while, but I'm gonna call headquarters. You get behind the wheel and wait. Call to the United States. Yes, sir. International booth. Pick up immediately as it rings. Where are we going? Where do we go? We're defecting. [ indistinct ] We've been looking everywhere for you. Come. Get in. [ tires screeching ] [creaming ] Isabelle! Come out, Filatov, let's go. Nyet! No. I not go anywhere. I defector. I here defect. Please. Hey! Through here. We better keep moving. Yeah, but where? You sure that guy's at the airport? Should we make to Patra in a boat for India? Yeah, but don't you see it's getting to Patra. I mean they'll have the transition covered and all the roads out of town. - You've forgotten something. - What? Tomorrow is the Patra, the harvest festival. They'll never spot us in that crowd. We'll get right out of town, and the next day you can take the boat to India. You mean we can take the boat? They've seen us together. Don't you understand, you're in this, whether you like it or not. Isabelle, if they catch you, they'll kill you. Why should I? You've got the file, and when you're gone, it's over. Isabelle... I belong here. I think we should get off the streets. In the absence of electricity, one must do the best they can, mustn't they? It's years since I've had the chance to do this. You know, the Italians were masters at improvisation. They could do the most wonderful things in the most difficult circumstances. Castor oil, water. Mac, I wonder if you'd mind resting his head on the table, please. Thank you. The trick is not to go bashing about. Just gently tap, tap, tap. [ loud scream ] Ivan! Alice, get the hell out of here. What? Ivan? What are you doing to him? I'm afraid we haven't got much choice. - He's as stubborn as a mule. - Ivan, tell them. Whatever it is they want to know, tell them. But they have not asked me a question yet. Psychopaths. Ivan, old chap, I wonder if you mind telling us where your friends are. Friends? I defector, I have no friends. Except Kibby. He is stubborn as a mule! - And twice as stupid! - Mac! I mean, the young couple with whom you have been consorting very much lately. Consort? Oh, you mean... Come on, tell us. Why you not ask me this before? They're no friends, they are cops. Come on, get to the bottom line. Where are they? In a hotel... Nipponia, I think. All right! Come on, let's go! Alice, you keep your eye on this screwball. Don't let him out of your sight! Ooh! I think we're losing the element of surprise. They're gone. How frightfully clever of you. [ speaking in foreign language ] 2,000 rupees. She wants it in advance. 2,000? She charges by the hour. Sorry, I couldn't have explained seven separate rooms. Sure. Sure they would have suspected something right away. Well, it's all here. More than enough to nail them. We'll be safe up here until the festival. The procession passes right along the street. Meanwhile, in a statement issued earlier this afternoon by the White House, the President described all negotiations with the Soviets on nuclear arms reductions, the so-called INF and SALT agreements as dead and buried. He went on to accuse the Soviets of entering negotiations in a spirit of cynicism unparalleled in the history of international diplomacy. Bob? The INF agreement rested on one basic assumption, that each side had the satellite capability to monitor the other's territory. Now that basic assumption was completely invalidated by the dramatic revelation that the Soviets now have the technology to intercept US satellite transmissions and substitute false information of their own invention. And this is the evidence they successfully concealed from a US military satellite. On a remote island in the Indian Ocean, Star Wars, Soviet style. Wall Street reacted dramatically to the news of the Moressan Star Wars crisis. There was panic on the exchange where the Dow Jones industrial average plunged a record 932 points. [ speaking Russian ] [ telephone ringing ] Hello. All right, let's take it up. They called off the Geneva peace talks. And the Pope is praying for world peace. I think we should cash in now and take our profits while the going is good. Profits, my ass. We're moving in for the kill. If Whittaker gets off the island with the file, - we're sunk. - He won't get off. Orushkin's got his boys all over the map. Listen to this. The World Bank wants the UN to intervene. And the company said old Macky would never make it big. Up yours, assholes. Mac, Agent Orange is on the phone. They found him. Over there! Come on! Ooh! Jesus Christ. Somebody... start playing the flute. Stop horsing around, shoot that goddamn thing. Is this yours? Yes, sir. Come on. Now be careful with that. Chu Chu, give me a hand. Hey. - We lost him, goddammit. - Don't worry, Mac. Vlad just called. He said he's on his way. What's that gotta do with the current price of eggs? 3T and the princess were seen by our Bulgarian comrades on the road to Patra. Oh, shit, they're heading for the boat. That's right. So we put together a couple of packages. Alice? Where the fuck is Alice? - Alice? - She's gone, Mac. Gone? Where? I don't know. Ask him. Alice, she go to embassy. She said, tell, you no worry. She come back soon. Dammit, she flipped the lid. I need him. We got to get them. - Got to get who? - 3T and that bimbo! That's what I'm saying. That's why we put together the packages.

Um, I wonder if maybe you could walk over to the back and then put your weight on the other end, then you... [ screaming ] [ speaking in foreign language ] What is this place? It's my second home. I spent a lot of time here after my husband... [ speaking in foreign language ] We'll be safe here until the boat comes. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. [ sheep bleating ] I don't fucking believe it. Don't even say anything, Mac. Don't spoil the moment. You could stay here. The people here taught me something I almost lost sight of. If you want to change the world, you have to take it one person at a time. And that means starting with yourself. 1,900, 2,000. Good, leave the rest to me. Very gently with those. [peaking in foreign language ] - It's your show now, buddy. - All taken care of. [ speaking in foreign language ] Okay, come on. [ indistinct chatter ] I could buy a castle with that much. What are you gonna do, Chu Chu? A brand new German engine. Good, good. [ speaking in foreign language ] To the money. [ speaking in foreign language ] Rob! Orushkin! You guys up there? It's difficult to understand how one man can shoot down a plane from inside the moving jetty. I told you, son of a gun is Dead-eye Dick. He's got a horseshoe up his ass. Right, Cleague? Oh, yes, he's absolutely amazing. Hey, Mac. 3T. You better be sure this time, Rob. Goddamn right, I'm sure. Eight pounds. MAC: Of plastic. ROB: As fragile as Uncle Sam makes it. MAC: As soon as Mr. 3T steps on to the passenger boat, ship blows. Mac! What happened to you? I fell down. And what the hell is he doing here? Never mind that. Is Whittaker all fine? Yes, he's okay for about 2 minutes. And then he's yesterday's bubblegum. Careful. Slowly. One person. One person at a time, please. Slowly... [ speaking in foreign language ] One person at a time, please. Slowly, one person at a time, please. Slowly. One person at a time. One person at a time, please. One person at a time, please. Mac. Mac. Wait. Watch it, Alice, this is ready to blow. Mac, listen to me, please. You got about 20 seconds. As soon as it was clear to me that Whittaker-- Eighteen. That he could run circles around you guys. - Sixteen. - Through a telex. - London, Tokyo, New York. - Twelve. I took the profits we made in the first two days. I sold the contract and I reinvested the money the other way. What way? Rising market, upside, recovery. - What? - What are you talking about? As soon as Whittaker exposes the crisis, we double our money again. If he doesn't, we're broke. She means we've got to let him get away. Every cent in the world is riding on that boy.
