There. That's where the ship will land. In the area of Nukem Crater. As usual the flight pattern will be remote controlled from the command centre on Earth... ...under the A.L.O system. What exactly is the aim of this moon flight Mr. Morland? Explorations around the Nukem Crater and the Nubium Sea. A most difficult and dangerous task and one of extreme importance. How did you choose the crew for this flight Mr. Morland? They were selected on the basis of experience and compatability. Projection. Major Perry Rhodan, the command pilot of the Stardust Program. A former NASA astronaut who's logged more flying hours in space than any other pilot. Apart from this Rhodan has already made two flights to the moon and commanded the recent and highly successful Mars recognizance team. Next we have Captain Bull, who's second in command of the operation. He's a specialist in astral propellants. Here we have Captain Flipper. He's an authority of many years standing in the radio and laser telecommunications field. And Dr. Minoli who'll be team medic. Ladies and gentlemen I hope I've managed to convey the essential points of the Stardust flight to you. What essential points, Mr. Moreland? Sorry sir, but I've told you all I know. Just a second. Yes, Moreland. You know I'm certain he's holding back on the reason behind this Stardust thing. Yeah, he's like the goose with the golden egg, huh Thank you, Mr. Michaels. Well control tells me the countdown's begun. The lift off is in 38 minutes. All 3 stages are fueled, computer readings are constant at D411. How do you read Rhodan? All systems are go. Then I'll say good luck. Zero First stage complete. I understand your feelings. Second stage motor is operating normally. Accelleration 12:1 constant Velocity 26 thousand Course Steady on 1-9-4-4 Congratulations, we seemed to have had a perfect liftoff again, Michaels. Thank you, sir. Let's hope the rest of the flight is as smooth. For the moment, my main worry is to keep the real reason for this flight truly secret. I must admit our space program has always fascinated me. but this Stardust flight I find particularly interesting. I have something here you might enjoy listening to, sir. A tape recording of a closed meeting of Intercosmos. Why is that so interesting? Because it explains the real reason behind Stardust. Let's hear it. About 6 months ago we took samples of rock from the Nukem crater using a robot drill. We know that professor, just give us the facts. To put it briefly, these samples indicate under the surface of the crater. There exist small deposits of an almost pure metal which has an atomic density... much greater than either cobale or lithium. If our supposition is correct... then this metal is incredibly valuable. In fact, beyond value. But you must have had some idea of this, Mr. Arkin? I admit I had heard a rumor. We must keep our ears open for the reports on it. And then Mr. Arkin? If they find it, then we'll take it. But what about transportation, the moon's a long way. Hmm, that's just a matter of organization. Furgeson The Coast Guard, sir. They searched the San Lorenzo & found the drugs. They were paid for don't worry. But the Capt. & the crew. They'll try to make a deal. You're afraid the men are going to talk. Yes sir, they know enough to break us wide open You'd better inform Sector 9, an explosion in the engine room. Right sir. None of the hands are to reach port. It is done sir. Good girl. Nicely manicured. What does the computer say, Flipper? Our orbital entry is in 48 seconds. Retros are on, angle of incidence is exact. Good. Alright,restore your respiration pill and put your helmets on. Stardust calling command center. Command center to Stardust. Reading you loud & clear. Stardust ready for landing phase. Roger stardust we're beginning the retro countdown. Now Completion of the first retro phase. How'd it feel? No worse than a fist in the stomach. The remote system has you riding an eliptical pole to pole orbit. Exact, we're over the top pole. We'll begin the 2nd retro phase on your third orbit. That will be in 9 minutes 47 seconds. What the devil is going on? The computer must have gone crazy. Both of the automatic line boosters are gone! Alright stay calm. We'll land with manual control. Mike, try putting on the gyroscopic stabilizer. Hey baby, fair deal, I didn't go 'n buy that return ticket for nothing. Another blank. I've tried all the transmitters. Can we get a bearing on their position? No. Not 'til we hear from them. They have a radio in the exploration vehicle, haven't they? Yes, if there's anyone left alive to work the thing. Did you find the trouble? Sounds pretty crazy, but there's not a darned thing wrong with it. That's right, all the electrical equipment should function perfectly well. but for some reason it doesn't. I've got a feeling that burst of interference was a little too coincidental. You saying there's a chance it was deliberate? Well its only a hunch, but we must try and find out. I've done some calculating and I think I've discovered where it came from. Not far from here? Yeah and its on the side facing the Earth. We'll try contacting control from there We'll keep in touch with you every 2 hours. Let's go, Mike. Perry, there's old Mother Earth, I wish I was in her lap right now. OK, let's try the radio. Put up the parabolic antenna. It's ready. Stardust to control center, Stardust to control center. Do you read me? over Look Perry. You alright? Yeah, I'm OK What was it? I don't know but the radio is gone. Perry, I'm beginning to feel unwanted. You know that? But it seems impossible there could be anyone here. Want some more good news? The motor? Wiped out, lets get out of here. Let's go. Look over there. Tell me I'm dreaming. Well now at least we know who's here with us. But who would build a thing that size? We haven't even got a motor... that would make that monstrosity fly. But that craft wasn't built on Earth, Mike. It's pretty eerie isn't it? I'd prefer a 12-headed, 6 eyed, 8 foot monster to this blasted silence. Well I'm quite sure we're being watched, so it isn't likely to... What's the matter, you lost your mind? Huh, no I just... Follow me. Quite an elevator, eh Perry. And up we go to paradise or possibly hell. You can take off your helmets. The atmosphere in here is quite safe to breathe. Well...its certainly better than inside this goldfish bowl. Why don't you take yours off or do you need different air? Our friend's only a robot. Exactly. Please come in. There's no need to be afraid. (addresses robots in Arkonite language) Well now I suppose you two will unscrew your heads & go hide in the closet. I can understand your resentment. But we always use robots when we first come in contact with other races. Since we can not presume what thei reaction will be. Yours was an aggresive attitude typical of primitive races. Primitive, us? But you're the one that committed the act of aggression, remember? We simply took over the control of your space vehicle. You were not in any danger. We only took a few defensive measures, Major Rhodan. How do you know my name? We intercepted your radio messages. It is necessary to be cautious when you find yourself as we do in a strange solar system. Especially if its inhabited. Where do you come from? From Arkon. Its a planet 34 million light years away. 34 million? My name is Khrest and this is Thora, the commander of our space ship. You speak our language perfectly. A breakdown has kept us here for 5 or 6 of your months During which we have been able to analyze and learn many of your languages. It wasn't hard to learn the babble of savages. I see, with all your science though you were still unable to repair your space ship. Unfortunately a crash damaged the section containing the robot repairmen. Khrest can't do anything about it just now. Because he's very ill. He gets weaker every day. Don't you have a doctor on board with you? We've neverhad a need for that word. Our race managed centuries ago... to conquer all known diseases. Illness is unknown on Arkon. Listen, we rough & ready cavemen have a Dr. with us. Perhaps he can help Khrest. Apparently our species are similar. Only apparently Among our inferior race the male usually treats the female with respect... but as for you Please. Thora didn't mean to offend you. I appreciate your offer very much indeed. Then let us out of here & we'll come back in a few hours with the doctor. We can get him here within seconds. Nothing? Nothing. I've tried all all four. Its as if the pair of them was swallowed up in a Hey listen. What is it? Hey, the ship's moving. Any news? Nothin' Mr. Arkin. So the mission failed? Its a pity about the advance you paid your man. That means nothing, my dear Cedric. you are forgetting a most important factor. And that is? Rhodan. Our friend is famous for getting himself out of the worst difficulties. Hmm...here. Thank you sir. Just keep your ears open. Yes sir. Do you know this illness. Yep It's a blood disease. The medical name for it Is leukemia. It's serious, isn't it? Extremely. Are you certain? I don't believe our organisms are the same. They are though, medically speaking they're identical. Just that genetically you're more ancient. And therefore...weaker. More... Degenerate. It isn't an attractive expression, but that's just about it. I won't tolerate such libelous insults. You & your riduculous res.. Stop provoking him. Yes doctor you've hit on the most serious problem of my race. Our civilization has lasted more than 10,000 years. Genetically we are... used up. Doc Is there anything we can do for Khrest? Possibly. An English Dr. called Haggard has developed a leukemia serum. Can we get a hold of it? There's only one supply. Haggard is still experimenting with it. So we'd have to go to him. Where? He runs a hospital in Mombassa, East Africa Khrest, how would you like to visit our planet? I would very much like to visit your planet We must let him rest, he's weak. Very weak. (background to Khrest: its just that medically, gentically you are more ancient) Could I have a word with you? Come with me. I have a question. Why did you enter our solar system? Khrest is one of the last great scientists left on Arkon. We're working together to save our race from extinction. You've tackled a tough job. How do you expect to stop the natural process of evolution? By uniting with a younger race. You wouldn't by chance care to start right away? No, Major Rhodan your race is not at all suitable. Intellectually you are too inferior. By our rating you have only reached the fourth stage of development. And you? The ninth. Well tell me at the ninth level of development. what happens when a man and a woman are together in a bedroom? I don't understand. I'm only putting on my flight suit. Oh. are you saying that a naked girl is of interest to a man? More or less. I'm content in the fourth stage. But we can talk about that later. The most important thing right now is to get Khrest to earth as quickly as possible. The sooner we find Dr. Haggard and his serum, the better. I'll think about it. There's no time for that. Khrest's disease is serious. If you release my space ship we can leave right away. I'm certainly not prepared to travel in your tin can. If nothing else it works unlike your highly developed vehicle. We have a standby, I'm afraid it only does the speed of light. but that's better than your wash tub. Why don't you stop putting on airs and look at me when I talk to you? How dare you?! That's a very primitive act. Well I'm only at stage 4. I could slip to stage 3 very easily. I know you're computerized, but I'm willing to play, lets see how brave you are. I win. Three aces. Uh oh. that's not fair. You used x-rays to pick out my cards. Mike, I hate to break up your game, but we're leaving for Earth as soon as possible. Then why don't I try to get in touch with control and warn them that we're on our way? We don't warn anybody. We use the emergency from this ship and land in a desserted part of Africa incognito. Why? Why? Because the Arkonites are centuries ahead of us in technology. You know what that means? Certainly, whoever gets hold of that knowledge could dominate the entire earth. Exactly, that's why its our duty to protect them & their space ship. Let's go. So we make the most sensational discovery of all time & we can't tell anybody. Its crazy. Say commander, do you mind if we're inquisitive? Go ahead you wouldn't understand the principles involved anyway. That's right. For example. We would never understand that this is a gravitational neutralizer... and that controls a magnetic anti-meteorite field. And this one is for um.. Comparative fall. Your eyes are very quick, just like your hands. Thank you. Now I think you better put your superior intelligence to work... and figure out a way to block out the radar net around the Earth. In about one second we're going to be starring on their screens. Do you really think so? Hey, have a look at this! What's happening? I don't know. I've never seen anything like this before. Are you sure its not Stardust? Absolutely sir. All the radar controllers from Greenland to the Antarctic report the same disturbance. What the devil's going on? Come on, Come on! Let's get nearer. Those robots are great tailors, but they haven't got a clue how to put buttons on. How do you feel? Much better, thank you. The air here is very invigorating. Where are we? In the dessert about 400 miles from Mombassa. Only it's not desserted, Perry. Over there. Damn, its a military vehicle, that means trouble. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. What are you gonna do? They won't bother us Stay where you are Major Rhodan. And don't interfere. I make the decisions here, you better understand that. Crazy idiot! Braking like that? I didn't, sir. Driver! Back it up. Get ready to fight. Come on, turn this thing around. Fire! What's the new trick? The ship is surrounded with a highly active field of energy. Completely impenetrable. They only have a machine gun now, but they could come back with something heavier. Nothing on this Earth of yours could possibly break this field of energy. Not even the heaviest of guns. I think I'll have to teach them a lesson. And don't tell me to be patient... with those childen, Major. Because patience is not a virtue for me. Activated energy? Its a gravitational neutralizer. Any material at which it is beamed, loses its... weight. The vehicle is pushed backwards by the recoil of the machinegun fire. Thora, stop playing with human lives and bring them down. You dare to order me around, Major? Thora! (speaks Arkonite) It isn't necessary to jeapordize human lives. Thora's disturbed. Why because we've been discovered? Perhaps... but I don't think it was that. Its busier than Central Park over the weekend. Yeah we might just as well land near Mombassa. The important thing now is to keep it secret. We need Dr. Haggard. Well let's push on. Isn't it better to move at night? Yeah, Flipper's right at least we'll have the advantage of surprise. Come on. We haven't got all day. Get in. Hurry up, lets get the Hell out of here. Well, what is it? News about Rhodan? Yeah, you might say. And its more than that. Right here in this message. Is a way to bring the world within our grasp. Phillip! Yes, sir. Advise the African sectors to collect at the rendezvous in Mombassa. Phone through to the Mombassa office, I'd like to speak to Wayne. And in 10 minutes I'll want the Cesna. Yes, Mr. Arkin. Business in East Africa is looking up. It means the next 48 hours, will without any doubt be the crucial point of my career. I have yet to hear a more infantile piece of balderdash. You'll be discharged as a lunatic, Do you hear? But General Captain the African Federation Army is... run on discipline, not on jokes. Yes sir, but this isn't a joke sir. You're damned right it isn't Captain Excuse me sir. A report has just been received at air control. an object has been seen in the Serengeti. They say its about 50 miles east of the rift valley Alert Company C, Leuitenant. I'm going to take a look at this object. We're going to pull them out of there and put them under arrest. Its no use, General. You won't get near it, sir. I tried to tell you before, the bullets we fired... Don't say it again. you're talking sheer nonsense. There is nothing either terrestrial or extraterrestrial... That can stand a blast from one of my 188mm shells! During the night we'll land here on the coast 5 miles from Mombasa. you can leave Mike & I and return here with the ship. And how do we meet up again after we've got Doctor Haggard? On the moon you picked up the Stardust and brought it alongside your ship. Can you do that with us? The device I used to lift Stardust is too large for this vehicle. We only have one on the mothership. Hmm, too bad. Haggard will need his instruments for the operation. Well, we'll have to get a car. And you can pick us up here in the Morain swamps. Here's the first hitch. Which is? We'll never be able to buy a car, we need money to do that. That's right and we don't have any. Silly isn't it? Here we are highly paid astronauts without a penny in our pocket. You can sell this. Its a very rare element called Fenya. Fenya? What's that in English? Common mercury. You mean you couldn't exchange this for one of those cars you've been talking about? The most you would get would be a couple of small medical thermometers. Thora? What substance is this? That's nothing. We use that for bolts, washers and riveting parts together. You call it, eh... carbon. Oh boy! On Earth we have another name for crystalized carbon. Diamond What is it? I'll be darned. Do you happen to have any spare washers & bolts lying around? Those are rejects. If they amuse you you can have them. Perry, Thora, there's a helicopter coming. Now Thora... I shall be nice to them. So don't worry. Do you think you're taking me on a tour of the country? Drive straight up the valley, Major! But the invisible wall sir. Good Lord! Don't say you believe in that rubbish. No, sir. Controls don't respond, sir, and the motor's cut out. Well I order you to restart the motor. Its amazing, sir. We should have crashed. There'll be a perfectly logical explanation for that. But as for this motor breakdown... a board of inquiry will decide on your irresponsibility. I'm General Ruhn. The Commander in Chief of the African Federation Forces. I want to talk to the commanding officer of this...object. You are. A woman is in command, here? I've never heard of anything in the world so ridiculously absurd. You are referring to this world, but I General come from another. Now thats something we will see about. The fact remains that you and your machine... are trespassing on territory that comes under the jurisdiction of my command. I landed, Gen. Ruhn on the third planet in this very small constellation... which according to our map is numbered 1-1-6-2-0 I couldn't care less about that. You are here illegally. You and your war machine This is beginning to get interesting. We're at war is that it General? Well I wouldn't say that. You'd better understand that I'm placing you under arrest. You'll have to come back to headquarters. You are inside an activated wall of energy. There is literally no way through it. So I advise you to be careful. That could be interpreted as a declaration of hostilities. Interpret it as you wish. Then I take it you refuse to cooperate. I refuse, yes. You agree to leave me alone and you can go General. I won't tolerate this. If you force the issue, I'll bring in artillery. That's not very friendly. You'd better give up, my troops are here already prepared for action. Did you put them in the mountains as well, General? No, there are no troops there. Well then, you go back and watch those mountains. I see trouble brewing. I think you should have talked to him instead. Maybe, but we don't want them to know we're on board. Hey, what kind of stunt are you going to pull now? Just a little demonstration to show the General what I can do. Huh, so they retreat. They seem to be crystalizing. They are. Its just a molecular alteration. So simple isn't it? Gentlemen, I think the time has come for us to call an emergency meeting of the general staff. Nice to see you again sir. How are things progressing, Lonnie. We carried out your instructions Mr. Arkin. I've got the teams ready and standing by for further orders. Good, we'll just wait now for our friends to act. So far they haven't done anything. They're still sitting out there in the Serengeti surrounded by Gen. Ruhn's troops. Ruhn's obviously under the illusion that he's going to capture the ship. As soon as we get our hands on it we'll begin the extermination of his entire force. If only he knew. The spaceship, it took off a few minutes ago and disappeared. Magnificient. They'll be flying right into our trap. Lets go telephone the police. Thanks, you're the perfect valet. Take this. What is it? A security device. This first control encloses you in a bubble of energy. It will protect only your person. The 2nd is a gravitational neutralizer which you've seen in operation. And the third button... if you press that you will be able to contact me. On this television screen. No play things for me? And this, is an automatic diredtion finder. If you're really in a fix, press this button. It will localize your position and I'll come and get you. I must be out of my mind to trust you with these things. Why do you give them to me then? Well its just that I wouldn't want you not to return safely. For Khrest's sake of course. Oh, yeah. Why else, Perry? Well for the present sir the situation is under control. But Gen. Ruhn, just a few minutes ago that spaceship took off for an unknown destination I know sir, but it returned almost immediately. So the can come and go as they please? For the moment, yes sir, but I'm studying their defense. There has to be a weak point somewhere. and the minute I discover it, I'll Its for you sir. Thank you Mitchell. Yes, hello. Very well, thank you. Now we know what happened when our friends made that short trip in their spaceship. It came down near Mombasa, two men were landed from it and then it took off again. This is the chance we wanted... with all roads in the area blocked we can check out every... suspicious move that's made. Leave it to me. Our friends won't last long. Whats the matter with you? You don't smoke so you wouldn't understand, but I haven't touched a cigarette for 3 days. Its painful. Hey, fella. Maybe you'd like to make a real big deal. Alright. Just one cigarette...for a diamond. I'm sorry sir, but your ancestors cheated mine you know. Trading with little bits of colored glass & there's no reason you're any different. If you want to buy something then lets see the color of your money. My friend is only joking. Do a thing like that again and we'll never get Haggard. Sir, may I have a word with you? I see you're strangers. May I be of any assistance? No thanks. Would you like to have som fun? I have some I have some very young girls. Very young. Hashish, whatever you want. Whenever you want. How about an automobile? But of course! I will take you to Sarryman, He will help you. Follow me, follow me. Please sir, just wait one moment. Perry, this would suit us fine. Good morning sir, my friend tells me you are interested in buying an automobile. How much for the Land Rover? You have impecable taste sir. With one glance you have chosen the best vehicle I have. Its barely drove, practically new look at the tires and the bodywork, the motor its a Its a precision instrument. Look, we're in a hurry, How much? Really, I don't know whether it sell it or to keep it for myself. Its such a perfect machine Well I wouldn't want to break your heart by taking it away, come on Mike. One moment. As a favor to a friend, all right. I'll sell it to you. How much? One and a half thousands. Is the price to you. Dollars? Oh no streling. We'll find another. Twelve hundred. Eight A thousand. Now we can talk This will ruin me. You can make it up if you'll exchange it for some diamonds. First I would have to see... It requires expert examination. This way please. Inform the others. Now, Please make yourselves comfortable. Yes, yes As you can see its worth more than a thousand Pounds. Yes, its not bad, but this is not the same diamond you showed me before. That one was bigger. I'm very hurt that you would try to take me in gentlemen. well let me see the others You heard him, the diamonds. Where are they, Mac? OK, OK Is 2 against 3 fair? Darn right! Come on. He was mine. Oh, I'm sorry. Right here. Pretty good. Stage 4 sure has a lot of advantages, but a combination Look out! His retros failed on him. Gentlemen, I apologize. I trust you are not going to hurt me. I ask you for your mercy. Tell me if there is anything I can do for you. We just want you to buy that diamond for an honest price. Of course sir, certainly. I offer you, let me see... The Land Rover and 500 Pounds. Excuse me. Yes, of course. One more thing. Where can I find Doctor Haggard's institute? This road, just 2 miles North of the town. Just a minute. Money is my religion. Excuse me, I was told Dr. Haggard was here. Can I help, I'm his assistant,Dr. Sheridan? Sorry, but I have to speak to the Doctor personally. He's in his labarotory, you'll find it over there. Thank you. Oh, doctor. What disease would put me into the hospital under your care? Galloping Malaria Doctor Haggard? Yes. I hate to interrupt you while you're working. Well this is a rather delicate & important experiment, I'm preparing my afternoon tea, however... What can I do for you gentlemen? I'm Major Rhodan, this is Capt. Bull Rhodan? That name somehow is very familiar. And so is the face. Major Rhodan! The Stardust! Are you related in any way to the famous astronaut? I am the astronaut. Come on now, I've just heard the news on the radio. The Stardust and her crew of four have disappeared somewhere... on the other side of the moon. Officially thats the story, but in reality we're here. You must agree that its not very easy to believe in a reality thats so... fantastic. I think you better prepare yourself for a more fantastic story. This is Cobra calling Section 8 do you read me? This is Section 8 Cobra, reading you loud and clear. over I didn't know we had a position here. What's you unit Captain? This is a special unit. The word fantastic is inadequate for your story, Major Rhodan. A more applicable adjective is incredible. It is, but I can prove to you that its true What is it Major? We're at Dr. Haggard's could you show him the patient? Of course. Thanks, Thora. Is everything OK? Perfect.I hope you have managed to convince Doctor Haggard to come. Yes. He's convinced. I'll go. Good, we'll leave right away and meet you at the space ship. Have you got everything you'll want? Yes, everything I need is here. Tell us what we have to take. No, my assistants will see to everything. send Dr. Sheridan and Nurse Silva into my laboratory please. Do we have to take them? Dr. Minoli can help you. No, I'm sorry Major. Its essential that I use assitants who know my technique in this operation. Some technique! Prepare a dose of antileukemia serum. And pack all the equipment necessary for the operation. Major Rhodan & Capt. Bull will help you load it in the car as soon as you are ready. Very well. I'm all yours, Doctor. They destroyed my office, the place is wrecked, then they drove off in my best vehicle You don't have any way of knowing which way these strangers were heading? No, I wish I did. But you know... wait a minute...they asked me the way to the institute of Dr. Haggard's Calling unit 16 Head out towards Dr. Haggard's institute calling unit 16 Thank you You drive. I was only trying to figure out if they were twins. Let's get moving. Stop! Stop! After them. Follow them. Step on the gas Mike, they're right behind you. This hack's doing nearly 80. come on. They're still gaining, try and use the gimmick, Perry. It's not here, I must have dropped it. The perfect ending. Give me some bandages & a lighter. Hey, what are you gonna do now? I'm going to try & slow them up. Here take this when you're in the savanah contact Thora All right, slow down. Are you out of your head? Slow down, put on the brakes. Come on. They could blow us to bits in a second. I'll call for help. How long will it take us to get there? It's roughly 400 miles, about 10 seconds. Fantastic! I'm glad to see you've come round, Major Rhodan. Who are you? A friend. What do you want, friend? What does this gadget do? Exactly where you dropped it. Where did you find it? I've had you under close surveillance since you landed. Now then. What is this device? Its a transistor radio. I like to catch the latest news broadcasts. And I can't stand to be without music. Cedric, that's no way to treat a friend So you don't want to help us, Major? Not really. Why don't you turn it on? Perhaps we'll get some music. Or perhaps it will blow up. Or perhaps you're afraid. No, this isn't so important now. Because I'm about to takeover your space ship. I don't think you'll make it. I know your Achilles heel. So you're wrong there, Major Rhodan. I'm well informed. By whom? Don't worry you'll know in good time. I think you're only half informed. Why? That space ship you want to take over is only a satellite of a much larger mother ship on the moon. There's a garrison there waiting for their commander to come back from Earth. Now if something should happen to her or the space ship... they have orders to take off for the Earth and destroy it. This is a bluff, Rhodan. If that's what you want to think. I'll show you. You'll see with your own eyes the capture of your invulnerable space ship. We're almost too late. Those police, darn it. If it wasn't for Perry, we'd never have gotten here. Did you have to leave him behind though? There was simply no other way. Will you be operating? No, not yet. first we must give him a transfusion. I need a breath of fresh air. Its suffocating in here. I'll be outside. Where's the anesthetic? I must have left it in the car. I'll get it Do you need a hand? I don't, but Nurse Silva might. She might at that! How's everything going? Not bad. The others should be arriving soon And Minoli doesn't suspect? As long as its only a transfusion, I think we'll be alright. The boss said that you'd give me all the details. What do I do? Get rid of that wall of energy. Then you've got to switch the interference signal on because that'll let the men know the wall's down. And the others, when do you reckon they'll get here Ann? That all depends Joan & I will be waiting for your signal. What? When everything is ready you say, "when does the operation start" alright? OK, you'd better go back now or they'll wonder what's happened to you. And that's it. I see. So you see my plan is perfect. Flipper, I can't believe it. He's a great astronaut, but loses at poker. He's had his uses. I paid all his debts and How much further Mr. Arkin? We're nearly there. Goodbye Rhodan. The signal! OK, Let's go. Step on it! I think I feel better. His pulse is steady, Doctor. That's a result of the transfusion. When does the operation start? We'll begin now. Ready. Don't move! Flipper, you? Hold it! And now our beautiful Arkonite is going to show us how to work her space ship. That I'll never do. Listen. Khrest will die if you refuse,Thora. You see my dear I'm not in actual fact, Doctor Haggard. The real Haggard is in our safe keeping. Alright. You cooperate now and we'll take Khrest to the Doctor. This time its for real. Alright Well, we're waiting. That, is what controls the flight computer. And this is the button... that activates the alarm system. I'll kill you you hellcat! Let go, let go. Let go of me. Let me go! What's going on? Two vehicles headed torards the ship sir. The must've lifted the energy wall. Signal to attack. Hey buddy, what all the commotion? They've activated that wall of energy again Cease fire. Cease Fire! Cease Fire! Ridiculous. We're as helpless as children. Mike! Mike! Come on, snap out of it. Well, the return of the hero. You alright, doc? Sure. What happened? Don't tell me it failed our plan was perfect. There's no time to explain now, we must get away fast. I brought the girl with me. That was good thinking, Flipper. We can still do it using her as a hostage. Come and get the girl! We'll hide out on the island. They've taken Thora with them. Amazing, a man like Haggard. I don't think it was really Haggard. Nor do I. I was very worried. How is he? That transfusion we gave him saved his life Khrest they've kidnapped Thora. Help me into the control room. You're not to move. Thora has a localizer. if she can use it, we'll find her. May I present Dr. Haggard, the real one that is. My dear, I'm afraid you've been tricked. That wasn't difficult, I can assure you. I'm sorry to be curious... but I've permitted myself an inspection of your very stylish belt. and was wondering... what the button controls. I'm sure you'd be happy... to explain. I imagine that its... one of your secret weapons. Is that right? Flipper says... you have never used it in his presence. Now, what about that button? Mr. Arkin, it would be much easier to just take the chance & give it a push. No! You idiot. What's wrong? Nothing happened. The signal, Thora's signal. She's succeeded. Now the automatic reactor will find her. Can you assist me Major? Lets get this thing off the ground. You're being very stubborn. If you think I would pass information to a gorilla, My Arkin then you're wrong. I take that to mean you consider yourself superior. I admit that what you're inferring is probably true. But you are a beautiful woman... and I'm sure you would hate to lose your looks prematurely. No man could justify such brutality. Remember though a gorilla has a perfect right to be brutal. You're the first people in the universe to whom we have entrusted our battle dress. We appreciate that trust. According to the indicator, She's there. Very good. Are you ready, Mike? Let us out. We'll use the emergency exit. Leave her alone. Hold it! Wait, wait! What shall we do with this rat, Perry? Nothing he's the real Haggard! I apologize Doctor. We'd better find Arkin. Don't worry. Mr. Arkin is about to learn that nobody should make an enemy out of me. You coming with us Doc? That's the end of a lot of evil men. Really? Is that so? Move over. Go on. That's better. How did he get here? With my belt, and the magnetic teletransporter. You've made a terrible mistake in opposing Arkin. and you'll pay for it. With your lives. Stay where you are. My patience is exhausted. The robot. While he's wearing the belt, it won't lay a finger on him. It's amusing isn't it? Now your weapons and superiority are against a piece of... Earthly antiquity. And they're useless! But there's one weapon that you can't fight Don't! No, not here. Its simple, little old courage. Don't move! Or I'll kill you! You could shoot one of us, but one of the others would get you. Stay where you are. All of you. Why not make a partnership with me. We'd be masters of the universe. Thora, open the door. No, its too late. It's a compression exit. and automatically opens to the outside. To the total void of space. You're looking well. Yes, I really feel much better. Lucky for me those crooks brought the right serum along. Hey Earthlings! I've been stoking the boiler. All we need is a crew & we're in business. Please, come back soon. Why sure we'll be back as soon as we've collected the materials to repair your ship. You know when I compare your scientific marvels to the Stardust. She reminds me of an old bicycle. But you're right not to divulge your secrets. Thora's correct when she says we're too young. And we're too old. You know I'd like to see an old dream of mine come true. A union of our two races. When you go back to Arkon, Pick out a couple of girls just like Thora. and I'll volunteer for the experiment. Where's the chief? Perry Oh boy, I hope you meant it! The experiment has begun.
