- Don't eat too fast. You'll get sick. Princess. Breakfast. Oh, what an angel, princess. It's Sunday. - Hello. Help. Someone, please. - I wouldn't be so perky right now if I were you. Chop, chop. It was an accident. No, I was paying attention. Not my fault. Not this time. I wonder how long he was working on that. They were so, so happy. He should have said something. You think he just wanted exercise because of all that sitting around? Don't laugh at me, please. It's not funny. I don't like punishing him. For goodness sakes. - You good, bro? - We're totally fucked about the mini Z's, Nate. - Nobody forgot the amps, Kyle. You just don't like the new 310s. - The real issue is driving for 11 hours for a three hour set at a pancake festival. - Look, I'm trying to do something. The Bonnie 10 international pancake festival is a hot bed for music producers. Everybody fucking knows that. - Nobody knows that. - Tell your girlfriend to shut the fuck up. - I'm not his girlfriend. - Children, please. I don't want to listen to this for another 180 miles okay. I'm gonna like fucking puke. Just be quiet. - You know, you can feel calm in the midst of like anything. The war, whatever. All you have to do is find that place. I'm serious. Like find that place in yourself. Take three deep breaths like from your diaphragm in and out. - He seriously has no idea how much he bores the shit out of people. - Yeah. He's always been like that. Easier to think than do. Isn't that right, pup? - Just trying to help. - Fucks he even talking about? What is this? Wendy, I thought you were navigating. - You got a turn coming in like 20 miles or something. - Where? - It's like 20 miles up. - This isn't even working. How do you know? - 'Cause I'm checking it on mine. Just put it back and pay attention. - Niche. Cunt. - It's ideas for a song so. There's a moment, you know, when you pick to do the right thing or the wrong thing. There's consequences to all our actions. Right things. Wrong things. - I like that. - Oh, Christ sake. You guys are killing me with that sad shit. - You assholes keep forgetting whose band this is. Nate, did you manage to record any of that? - Yeah, most of it. - Most of it. - Why do you have to be suck a dick? - You got something you want to say, princess? - Nothing you'd understand. - Dude. - Kyle. - What are you doing? Are you fucking kidding me right now? - Stop. - Are you serious right now? - You're gonna protect your girlfriend? - She's not my fucking girl. What the fuck are you doing? Get away from her. - What? What are you gonna do about it, Pup? - Stop fucking calling me that. - Yeah. What are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna fucking do about it? - I'm not. Are you kidding me? - Yeah. - Are we really doing this? - What? - Are we really doing this? - We're doing this. - What are they doing? - Probably venting testosterone in preparation for the next pee break most likely. Did Nate really find you at a bus stop? You were running away, weren't you? It's fine. You don't have to answer. I guess we're all running away from something. Do you usually come up with lyrics off the top of your head like that all the time or? - No, they just kind of pop into my head and. - Well, I'm tired. You know I'm tired of waking up to the stench of flat fucking broke, but I can tell you're different. Things are gonna be a little different with you. When they were in high school, some snot nosed kid moved into town, right. His name was Archibald Carmichael Butt. I mean seriously, what kind of sorry ass name is that right? Anyway, this kid like latches onto Nate and Nate has a thing for losers, which I don't mean any offense to you at all. But he ends up taking this kid down to the beach to ride like boogie boards to surf and some shit like that. The kid gets swept up in the surf. He's screaming, right. So Kyle comes running out. - Nate, what are you doing? Come on. - But Nate just stands there and like watches this kid fucking drown. Kyle ended up busting his leg. - Ah. Ah. - Stupid kid ended up drowning anyway. - Nate. - Yeah, but that was like a long time ago. I mean, surely Kyle can't blame Nate for- - Can't? - Something that. - Can't is a strong word. You know. Fact is they don't make football scholarships for gimps. - Stop calling me that. Stop. Fuck away from me, bro. Do you feel better now? - I would if you fought back, - I thought you- - You thought what? That I was gonna hit her? - Yeah. - Come on, Nate. I didn't mean anything by it. - Are you fucking serious? Fucking disgusting. - You know, you should really make your move on her unless you want me to warm it up for you. - Just this one. - What? - Leave her alone, man, come on. - Come on, dude. I'm not gonna break the bro code. Not with a chick like that. Let's get the hell out of here. - I'm not Patrick. I'm not Patrick. I'm not Patrick. - You don't see that every day. - Maybe he needs help. - Probably just some redneck snorted too much weed killer. - It's the middle of nowhere out here, bro. Maybe we should help him. - Come on, let's go. Come on, get in the van. Come on, dude, get in the van. - What was that about? - I have no idea. We should probably get the fuck out of here. - Please quickly. - There's gotta be somewhere to eat too, right? - We've already stopped like 15 times. - My blood sugar's low. All right? - All right. - You know how much you upset me when you disrespect me, Patrick. - Mrs. Hellstrom, please- - Did you think I wouldn't find out about your little Hawaii trip? Think I can't read an Amex receipt? - I keep telling you. I'm not your husband. My name is Tucker Wilds. I have two little girls. My wife knows where I am. She'll call the police. - I'm your wife, Patrick. That was a neat little trick. No one's ever done that before. Don't worry, I still love you. I'll always love you. That's how we differ, Patrick. I keep my promises. - Where are we? - Angel Falls. - This is fucking it? One strip. - It's definitely a yeehaw town. - What the hell, man? - Just fucking around with it. Relax. - Don't touch my shit. God. - Jesus, I need a break. Yo, that guy was seriously fucked up. - Oh, come on, man. - Something fucked up about that guy. - Let's just keep going. Why are we gonna stop again? - Yeah, because I'm fucking hungry, dude. - There may be something small up the road up there. - Perfect. How 'bout some pie? - Oh, fuck me. How 'bout we don't stop? - How 'bout I'm starving. - It's amazing how you find pie in the middle of nowhere. - Bum fuck pie. It'll do. - Dude, come on. - Kyle, this isn't open. - It's not open. - The lights are on. - They're probably cleaning up, man. - All right, well let's get them before they close. - Fucking really wanna be that guy? They'll spit split our food. - Dude, I'll make sure they don't spit in our food. I'll spit in your food. - Whatever, dude. - Just get out of the car, all right. - Just fucking take your insulin. - Whoa, watch your step there, tiger. - Yeah, watch out for that. - Let's just go. It's closed. - Well, you can stay in the car, princess. - Relax, man, all right. - It's open. Shouldn't have left the door open if you didn't want any customers. Hello? - Kyle, I don't know about this, man. - Just sit down, Nate. The door was open. - Yeah, dude, a tip. Just because the door is open somewhere, doesn't mean you should walk the freak in. - Just relax, okay. It's fine. - It's not fine. There's no one here and this place makes Lily nervous so. - Yeah, well air makes Lily nervous. Isn't that right, sweetheart? What's going on inside that little brain of yours, huh? You're just not gonna say anything? - Come on, are you serious? What the hell was that? - Whoa. I'm just messing. - God. - Hey, kitchen's closed. - Your door was open and the lights were on and we've been driving all night. Surprise for our grandmother's birthday. Lonely 98 year old. Can we just get a bite to eat? - Handsome couples. Look like models. - Or just a couple of cups of coffee would be fine. - To go. - Should be telling people where you're going in case something happens. People disappear and they won't know where to find you. World full of crazies. - Wouldn't be much of a surprise then, would it? How 'bout some menus? - All right. - Grandmother? - What? - Really? - It worked. - You really want to eat here, bro? - Bro, I'm fucking starving. - I know. - Shut up, she's coming. - Thank you. Does everything have cherries on it? - We got that burger. - Grill's closed. - All right, look, look. If the grill's closed, then we should just leave. - How 'bout a piece of my warm cheery pie? Right from the oven. My cherry pie won state fair four times and I seem to have an inventory of surplus. So. It's free. - I would like some of your cherry pie. - Well, why don't I make you some coffee with that. - Still got it. - You are a pervert. - What? Old gals know what they want. - Ladies room? - Sounds good. - Yeah. - I wish you wouldn't talk like that in front of her. - Fuck that. What do you see in her? - She's cool. - Cool. - She's genuine. - She's insane. - There's no TP. Thank you. Hey, can I ask you something? - Yeah, sure. - Kyle doesn't seem to be you're... Like you're- - Not my type. - Yeah. - Well, I mean, I can say that he's good with his hands. Got stamina. And something to prove so. He's like exactly my type. - You know, he's not the bully he pretends to be. He really loves Nate. - I thought you hated Kyle. - What gave you that idea? - Really? Whatever. Can I ask you something then? - Sure. - What do you feel about Nate? - Eh. Oh, come on. Don't give me that. You notice every time he gives you those puppy eyes, which is like all the time. - I barely know him. - Whatever. - Hey, thanks for letting me into the group. It was really awesome of you. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Freak. - Cobwebs have a nice touch. - 'Til death do us part. - A study in love. - World renowned photographer. - Okay. We'll accept that. - In love. These are awful. - Don't hold back. - What do they know? Philistines. - Wow. All right, if you're talented, you should have your work in a gallery. I mean in a real gallery, not like this. Or you know, maybe your own tattoo parlor. - She thinks she's good at these. She's really not. It's sad. - What is it about you? - What? - Sorry. I just, sorry. - Nate, I'm not who you think I am. Okay? - Okay. And? - It's really- - Well, I think that would depend on who I think you are. Right? - Yeah. - I think you're a good person with a kind heart who's had a rough time. Just needs to find someone who. Someone who you can trust, you know. Someone who will love you. - What? - Nothing. It's. They won a surfing competition wearing street clothes? - Yeah, they don't really look happy about winning either. - So granny's batshit crazy. - Read my lips. Free pie. - And that little stray of Nate's is whacked, too. I'm not sure what he sees in her. At least we know he's not gay. - Shut up. All right. - Here we go. Pie to die for. - Ready to go? - Pie to die for. - Yo Nate, we're out of here. - Quick, I got a signal. Escape selfie. Oh, come on. We're sisters now, babe. Let's go. Ready, okay. One, two. Three. Oh my God. It's adorable. Stop. - Hey. - Sorry. - Leave that alone. Get out. Get out. Get out. Get the hell out of here. - I can't. I can't. - For God's sake, gotta hurry up, man. - No, no. Oh my God. - Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. - Get in the car, dude. What the fuck was that, Nate? - What did you guys do? - Your boyfriend set off a nuclear bitch bomb is what happened. - He's not my boyfriend. - Those people in the photo, they fell. It looked like they were fucking moving. - They were what? Nothing. Jesus. - Well, I would like your cherry pie. - Yeah, that's probably what set her off, dude. - Let's just get out here. - Yeah, let's get the fuck out of here. - She's coming. She's coming. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - What have you done now? Another accident? - I liked them. They always did what they were told. - Ellinore, they only do what they wanna do. You can't trust them. You're going to have to take care of them. Like the kittens. - They were nice. I liked you. I liked all of you. But I'm sorry I can't take care of you anymore. - Aw, you know what you have to do. You know what you have to do. - But I liked them. - Ellinore, you know what you have to do. - Ellinore, you know what you have to do. - Oh my God, water. - For God's sake, what do you want from us? - She's gonna drown us. - No, no, no. - Oh Jesus Christ. - The calendar. Nathaniel. - Nathaniel. It's all Nathaniel's fault. A piece of pie on the road. - The gallery is no longer balanced. You can't leave it like that. Mind your temper. You make mistakes when you lose your temper. You get sloppy. You get messy. - I love you, Dad. - Shut her up. - Shut up. - It's coming up here soon. - You said that like 10 miles ago. - There's no satellite. What do you want me to do? - I don't know. How 'bout that pie at least? Fucking frozen pie. - Jesus. - Dude, just take it down a notch. - You wanna fucking drive? - Do you have to say fuck every other word? Can you please slow down? - Yeah, where's the next bus stop? - Quit being such a dick, bro. - Jesus. Kyle. Oh, come on, guys. - Do something. Hit me, Nate. Come on, hit me. What the fuck's wrong with you? Hit me. There he is. There he is. - Should we take out a ruler and make it official, gentlemen? - Get in the front. I'm driving. - Oh now you wanna drive? - He hit you in the face. - It's about time, right? - No problem. These will work just fine. - Yay, cell service. - Woo. Let's do this. - All right, you're gonna wanna take a left after. - Am I dead? Did we crash and die? - Where the hell are we? - We're not dead. Fuck me, we're trapped. - Trapped? - No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. - Okay, I know this is a dream, but God this feels so real. Crazy lady from the pie shop. Why is she in my dream? - Hey. Hey, get us out of here. - Hey. - Maybe she doesn't see us. - She sees us. - She doesn't care. - Where's she taking us to? - What the fuck does it matter? We gotta get outta here. Remember us? You gave us some pie. Where are we going? - My head. - Are you okay? - Jesus. Look where we are. I mean really, Nate? What the fuck? This is all your fault. - Free pie, asshole. - Hey, you're the one who broke the picture. - Okay, let's just figure out a way to get out of here while I'm still asleep because if I wake up and this shit is real, I can't do this. - That's a long way down. - Hey, what's wrong with her? - She's not good with confined spaces. Just leave her alone, okay. - What's that? Like agoraphobia? - Yeah, I'm allergic to plants, moron. - Well it's probably a phobia. - Claustrophobia. - You got something you want to say, orphan weirdo? - Hey. - Get the fuck away from me. - Bro, the ceiling. - You're right. - Can you get up there? - Do it, Kyle. - All right, get me up. Get me up. - What's it feel like? Anything? - It's like freaking cement. - Fuck. - Bro, you have to say fuck every other word. Jesus, we get the picture. - Get the picture. That's funny. - All right. Anybody have a phone? - Fuck, mine's on the dashboard. - Oh my gosh. I have mine. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Anything? - Yeah. Fuck, no service. - It's okay. It's okay. Mine's in the car. - Mine's plugged in the charger in the van. - You got anything useful in there? Fuck, come on. - Please, just. Sorry. - Nate. No pen knife? Really a spoon? - This is my lucky spoon, Kyle. - Yeah, well let me. - What are you gonna do with that? - I don't know. Come on. - Give me that. - Fuck. - Come on. - Hey, hey. Nate, get up, get up, get up. There's other people, come here. - You're not going to hear us, but you look like nice folks. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. You guys get up. Get up, there's other people. Hi. Hi. - Sorry your lives just went to shit. - They're saying something. What are they saying? - I don't know. You know sign language? - What is that? - And you said sign language class was going to be a waste of money. - Fuck you doing on my phone? - What are you doing, Kyle? - Yeah, tell 'em we're in distress. That's really gonna help. - What? You think they know fucking sign language? - What, you think they know fucking morse code? - All right, all right. Let's just try something else, okay. Let's put our bodies into letters like they do when they're stranded, okay. Help me make an H. - Okay. - H. - Get off me. Sorry. - Sorry. - I. Hi. Hi. Hi, guys. - I don't fucking know. - That's an H, yeah. H.and. Yeah I. - Okay, just let's figure out something else. - Let's ask about escaping. - Yeah, yeah. - Or at least let's find out how long they've been stuck in there. - We don't want to know that. - I think we need to know. Come on. - All right. - H. - Okay, what is this? - How? - They don't want to know. - They have to know. Come on. - 20. 20 what? Days, weeks? - No. Years. - Shit. - Anybody have to pee? Thirsty? Hungry? Blood sugar level? - I'm not hungry. Why am I not hungry? - What does that mean? - It means they're all young like us. - Yeah, but what the fuck does that mean? - It means that if they haven't aged and they've been in there for 20 years, they're stuck in time, bro. - Wait, wait. So the same thing's gonna happen to us? - Same thing did happen to us. Look where we are. - We're a part of a collection, you guys. - What are we animals in a cage? She collects people? - She's an artist. She fancies herself an artist. - How do you know that, Lily? - Because I know, Wendy. - Great. - God, she's not gonna let us out of here, is she? - No. No, she's not. - She's coming. She's coming. - Come on, we better stand up and get in position like they are. Grab a surfboard. - That was for your own good, Patrick. Are you gonna behave now? - I got it. - Please. - I got it. - Lily. Oh Lily, you really shouldn't have done that. - Whoa. - Sorry. Little temper problem. Everybody okay? - Get her now or she'll never learn. - Wendy, Wendy. Wendy. Wendy, look at me. Look at me. - It's gonna be okay. - It's gonna be okay, Wendy, I promise. I promise, Wendy. - You gotta take deep breaths, okay. It's just gonna make it worse if you don't. - It's okay. It's okay. - Kyle. Kyle. Doesn't that look like the guy? Where's Lily? Where's Lily? - I don't know. - Lily. - No. - What do you think? Closet? - Well her father used to lock her in a chest in the barn. She's always been bad. - Coffin then. Apparently, you've always been bad. Knock, knock. - No, please. Please let me out. Please send me back to them. I'm sorry. Please. - I liked you. - Please don't. - I really liked you. We were the same. Both artists. - She mocked you. - She did. It's a shame. Just a shame. - You fucking bitch. Let me out. - By the way, your new friends. Your so called new family, they don't even like you. They pity you. Everyone's always pitied you, except for that sad sack Natey Nate. He has a little crush on you. - Shut up. - How do I know? Little birdie told me. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Please. - You think you're so good at love. You're not really. This is it. - Is that gonna happen to us all? Like I mean is she gonna disappear us all? - Lily antagonized her. I mean, you can't antagonize deranged people. - No shit. Thanks, Dr. Phil. - Why are you defending her? - I'm not. Not defending her. I just. - You are. - Look, guys. We gotta keep our cool, okay, or else we'll never get out of here. The only way is if we stay calm and figure out what the hell we're up against 'cause I have no idea. - Yeah, but Lily still can be all right. - Lily. What about us? Our big fucking break. - Fucking cherry pie. - Wait. Wait, wait. Lily and I took a selfie. - You did? You had a signal. - Yeah, it was right outside that door. It was just for a minute and then I posted it to Instagram. - Okay, cool. Great. What's the name of this place? - I don't know. - It's the world famous. - Fucking cherry pie. I don't know. - Ah. Oh, fuck. That fucking bitch. I'm gonna kill you. - Don't think like her, okay. Don't ever think like her. That's what evil wants. That's what it always wants. It wants a way in. That's how it separates you from your soul. Don't let it. Lily. Yes, we're gonna get out. Somehow, I promise. - Dispatch, this is rescue. Over. - Go rescue. This is dispatch. Over. - Dispatch, this is rescue. So we just finished our training and I think we got an abandoned vehicle. Break. - We're one. Go to three over. - Roger that. I'll go to three. Dispatch, this is rescue on three. Over. - Okay rescue, this is dispatch. Send your traffic over. - Dispatch, I got an abandoned vehicle on northbound Old Grove Road near our training site. Break. - Okay, what's the description? Over. - It's a blue villa. Cali plates. Six until Yankee two two niner. Over. - Okay, I'll get Phil up there to take a better look at it. He's away from his radio at the moment, so I'll call him. Over. - Roger that. Rescue out. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way. - No, we got about 45 minutes. Phil patrols the gentleman's club in Padinsky on Mondays. Hey. I don't know what I'd do with it. Just thanks, Barn, all right. - Yo, Sidney. - Can you tap the tank under the chassis? See if there's any gas in there. - Yeah sure. - Thanks for coming. - Again. No skid marks. No sign of struggle. Heart attack? - And they walked away? - Stolen? - It's abandoned. It's got gas in it. You chase up these kids on social media. I'll text you a copy of the registration. Find out who they were. Are. Who they are. - One of your disappearance? Chris had just ran away, Sid. She was always running away. These here kids got drunk, ran off the road, and went for a wander. - Musicians. They wouldn't willingly leave their gear with the door open. And their gear is missing. Glove box is open. Rifled through. Keys were left in the ignition. Four half drunk sodas. No, four kids got disappeared right out of the middle of this goddamn road. Same as before. Same as Chris. - Or maybe these kids went back to pick up their gear. Three of them are screwing in the back. Driver got distracted. Crashed. Walked away to get help. - Humor me, will ya? Last time. - Last time was the last time. - She always came back. - That she did. - Oh, our music was supposed to set us free. Supposed to be our big break. Our big pancake break. We should've known. - It's been what like a week? - Yeah. - How long you think it'll take for someone to find out where we are? - It's been six days, bro. - Six? - Six days? - That's it. - No, it's been a week. - No way 'cause Sunday was the day we got here. That was fucking cherry pie day. Monday. I don't even think we even see her. Tuesday you realized we can't play cops and robbers in a space like four feet wide. - We still can. - Wednesday. Wednesday you guys had the argument about whether it was cunnilingus or cuntalingus. - Cunnilingus. - Cuntalingus. It's cuntalingus. - It's not. And yesterday you had the brilliant epiphany about how yellow mustard is somehow holding back hotdogs. - It's blue. It's blue. Mark my words. That's a goldmine. A goldmine. - And speaking of goldmines, guys, like I was totally planning on buying a new porch with my pancakes. - I was thinking about getting me a three bedroom ranch. - What? - Yeah. - You can put cows and everything. - With cattle and pigs and roosters and sheep. Ba. And pigs. - You said pigs already. - I did, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah, like what about llamas? I heard there was really good money in llamas. - They spit. - That's camels. - Llamas. - Camels. - Llamas. - Isn't that camels? - How the hell you guys can sit here arguing about llamas and camels when Lily's gone and we're trapped in this freaking photograph. - Jesus, Nate. You take yourself so serious. And I thought Kyle was the devoid of fucking humor. - Hey. Hey. Hey. - Oh late today, Ray. - Now, now, Ellie. Don't be coy. You know why I'm here. Only thing that's gonna work this time is if the restrooms all have soap and paper and there ain't no trash under them tables. - Looky here, Ray. You know I'm the only one here. How's a single gal supposed to manage without a strong man around? - My hands are tied, Ellie. - I got a fresh cherry pie right out of the oven, Raymond. Ooh. Besides, I got myself a new hire. He'll take care of all those details for me. - You really found someone to work here? - Would I lie to you, Raymond? My luck is changing. I can feel it. You'd be surprised at all the lucky things that just keep happening around here for me all magic like. - Lucky, huh? Oh heck, I guess I can lose these papers for one more week. - Thank you. You know, I've been lucky since I was a little girl. Coffee, black, no sugar. - Right. Mm mm mm mm mm. Mm. No man in his right mind would leave a woman like you. What a God given talent for pie. - Patrick never really liked my pie. - But not that it's any of my business, but he'll be back when he comes to his senses. Tail between his legs. What's up? - Another goddamned abandoned vehicle. I thought we were done with all that crap. Captain's all hot. Like I got time to go pulling over every out of state plate. Hey, could you make that to go, hun? - Sure. - There's something mighty sinful in that woman's cherry pie. - My thoughts can get a ticket racing around those curves. - Jail time. Hey Ellie, you seen any strange kids in the last few days? - Stranger than the men around here? - Two girls, pair of boys. 20s. This would be about a week ago. - Can't say I have. - A van turned up empty just North of town. Had one of your pie boxes in the back. - Folks they come, they go. My memory's not like it used to be. It's been tough on me running this place all alone since Patrick left. - This help? - Come on, Ellie. I warned you about that animal in this eating establishment. You trying to get me fired? What's up with that damn cat? - She's possessed. - Well, time to get back to work. - This is a different picture? - By golly, Ray. Wouldn't believe the effort I put into keeping these exhibits fresh and not a single soul has ever noticed. - Yeah, just like those big time art museums. - Yes. I try to keep things interesting around here. - Well, some of us appreciate your talent, Ellie. - Oh. - Hey. Gotta be shitting me. - He was right there. - No one's ever gonna notice us. - Fuck. - What do you want? We're closed. - Yeah, but I mean the signs says- - Help wanted, yeah. - Excuse me, ma'am I just wanted to- - Look, do you want the job or not? Can't you see I'm busy with customers? I'll get you a broom. You sweep, don't you? Don't come begging here if you don't sweep. What are you looking at? - Just reading the sign here, ma'am. World renowned photographer. This would be your work? I don't often see this kind of talent. Not in these here parts. - Oh, well I'm a natural talent. - Well, talent like this, well that would be quite rare, ma'am. - Thank you. Well. - Wouldn't presume the same, ma'am. - Can't you see that that's a marriage? The way a marriage is supposed to be. Forever. - Well, no fine women ever had no interest in me, ma'am, so I couldn't rightly say about marriage, but I'm mighty grateful for the job though. - Well, come back later. Mopping. Won't have you scaring off my customers. You know how to mop, don't you? - Sure do and thank you kindly. - Yeah, sure. - Sid, your door's unlocked. - Credit cards from one of the girls purses was used to buy cigarettes and diapers at the Walmart in Jamesburg. Local meth head said the van was empty when they got there. How'd you do? - I followed the Instagram lead. Pie shop, Angel Falls. Met the old bag who runs the place. Elle's Country Kitchen. - She's seen the kids? They must've stopped in there. - Well, funny that I was gonna ask her. Maybe they stopped in. You know, maybe they got hungry. - Yeah, maybe they got hungry. - But before I could say bodiddly, she hires me to clean the place. - What? - This gal is Looney Tunes. I mean, she is coo coo for cocoa puffs certifiable. - You think she knows something? - Oh yeah, she knows something. We had a long talk. - About the kids? - No, about sweeping. I didn't get a good look. She's watching me like a hawk, but there's a photo hanging there on the wall of a bunch of surfers looking like your van kids. Going back to mop. - What? - She hired me to mop. - You want me to come with you? Mopping's kind of technical. - Don't want to tip her off. She's hiding something, okay. What about the missing musical instruments? - I got a couple of calls into some pawn shops. Expecting a call any minute. Something will turn up. - Always does. - Always does. Hey, Barn. - Yeah. - It's a little dusty. - Now you know where you can stick that finger. - Trash needs emptying, too. - Yeah, sure. - No one's ever gonna notice us when we can't move when anyone's here, except for that stupid mad cow. I mean, God, like what's the point of this? What is this place? Who the hell is she? - What is she? Oh shit. - What's that? What do you got? - We can't move, right? But this stuff can. So I don't know. Why don't we? Why don't we move stuff around and try to get a message to the outside? - Yeah okay, Nate. Then what happens if Ellinore sees it? - What if she does? - You saw what she did to Lily. - What if she let them go? - God, you really are stupid sometimes. - I'm not stupid but I- - All right, all right. Look, we're not staying here for 20 years, okay. We gotta try something. - Okay, say we do get out, Nate. Then what? Are we gonna get back to normal size? - Bro. Recognize him? - Is that the weed killer dude? - Yeah. - He got out somehow. So can we. Dude, come on, we gotta try something. - All right. - Hold it. - Take it all the way, take it all the way. - Okay, okay. Got it? - Yeah. What do you wanna spell? - What can we spell? Help. That's an H. - There's an E. L right here. You see a P? - We got it. Okay, okay, okay. - Here, here, here. Does it work? - Yes. Where's L? Where's L? Guys hurry up, come on. Is anybody watching? Is she going by? - Hey. No, because I'm already here. What? Her husband? When was this? Well, maybe he ran off with somebody else. Somebody normal. Sid, look, I'm just gonna mop on over to the photo on the wall. Take a picture of it and mop on out. I mean, what's the worst thing that could happen? Okay, I will call you after my chores are done, Mom. - Ah. - Pick up, Barn, come on. - He's laughing at you. He's always laughed at you. - Look at me when I'm talking to you. Why on earth do you need a digital camera? - Patrick? Patrick. - Are you deaf? I'm asking you. Why do you need a digital camera? Since when have you ever had any talent? - Of course I have talent. My pie. My cherry pie won state fair four times. Everyone loves my pie. - Oh you mean Nana's cherry pie? You stupid cow. You stupid cow. When are you gonna have time? Huh? You can't even keep this place clean. - Look, I just. I need something. An outlet. All I do is I cook. I clean. I serve customers. - Yeah, what? What customers? What is it you exactly do here all day, hm? I mean, you sure as hell not keeping yourself up. That's for sure. I mean, a goddamn monkey can do a better job at keeping this place up. Well. - Don't pick up after that slob. You're not his dog. You do all the work around here. He sits around all day, jerking off and drinking beer. - Maybe. Maybe you can help sometimes. - Help? Who do you think makes the money to pay for this little disaster here? I mean, do you think I like driving around selling tractors to these redneck retards? Jesus Christ, Ellinore. What the hell are you looking at? Hello. Great. Going psycho again. - I know about your little whores. - What has gotten into you, huh? - Stop it. Let go of me. - Don't let him manhandle you. - Get away from me. Why are you doing this to me? - Hey, hey. You made me hit you. You know how I get when you disrespect me. You know. It's the bird. It all started with the goddamn bird right? Huh? - Stop. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Ah. - Maybe I should put the miserable thing out of its misery. - Stop it. Stop it. Stop. Ow. - All these redneck losers think you're so special. You're so pretty. You're so nice. You're so sexy. You're not better than me. You make me sick. You're disgusting. Bye, bye, birdie. You stupid cow. You're disgusting. You make me sick. You make me sick. You make me sick. You make me sick. Sick. Sick. - He was ugly before. He's beautiful now. You have a rare gift. Master the pain, Ellinore. The art of punishment is transformational. If you capture your creations, you can keep them forever. It's easy. I'll teach you. - I guess you're not really Patrick. He seems to be dead. - You've come a long way, Ellinore. You don't need to keep them anymore. Any of them. - Let me out. Let me out. Let me out here. - I'm sick and tired of this. Do something. Either do something or kill me. Kill me now. - Please, please, I won't tell anyone. I just wanna go home. Please come on. - You know what you have to do. - Come on, Dad. Would you just chill? I'm going to Kelly's to get a book. I'm coming right back. I promise. What's the worst that can happen? - Fuck. - Jesus Christ. - Fuck. - Dude, can you calm down? - Don't tell me to calm down, Nate. This is all your fucking fault, you coward. - Yeah, well why don't I blame my whole fucking life on my brother like you, you fucking loser? - Fuck you. - Yeah, I was scared, okay. I was fucking 15 years old, you piece of shit, but if I could, I'd do it again. Then you'd have your fucking NFL career. Your 10 block that's wise and all your other stupid fucking shit. You all right, bro? - I never fucking liked football anyway. - Hey. Hey guys, you moved us. You guys moved us. Your little tangle moved us, look. - Hey, she's right. What do we do? Let's do something. - Let's jump on three. - Yeah, all right. Everybody jump on three. - You ready? - One, two. - Ready? - One, two. Ah. - One more time. - One more time. - One, two. - No. - Who was that? - He's probably looking for that dead guy. - Too late. - Oh. - No. - Somebody help me. Somebody help me, please. - Ah. - Look at the mess you made, Ellinore. I'm so utterly disappointed in you. - Shut up. No. No. No. - She's fucking losing it. - Cat. - Oh, don't get too excited. I got something special planned for you. - The cat. The cat. Get his attention somehow. Yes. - Oh. God. - You guys, okay? - Yeah, are you, Kyle? You okay? - Wendy, you all right? - There's glass on me. - Hey, careful. - Oh shit. - It worked. Guys, come on. - Okay. - Let's go, let's go. - Lift me up. - Yeah, I got you. - Wait, wait, wait. Stop. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. Look. - What? - There's something up there. - Who cares, dude? Let's get the fuck out of here. - What if it's her? - It doesn't matter. - Get up there. Nate, come on, help. Got it? - Yeah. - Ah. Ah. God. No, no, no. - Nate. Nate. - Kyle. - I should've told you. - Fuck. God fucking dammit. I love you too, bro. Lily. - You could've just captured him with your camera. Then you wouldn't have to lift him into the freezer. You made so many mistakes. You've been sloppy. - Stop it. - You've been messy. - Messy. - Forgetting anyone? - Nathaniel. It's gonna be okay. - You need to finish your work, Ellinore. - Don't. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. - No. - Ah. - Sick bitch. - I knew there was something fishy about him. Don't worry. You won't bleed out in there. Nothing ever happens in there. You're an artist. You should watch. Your punishment. It's transformational. - No, don't. Please, please, don't. I don't wanna die. No. - Okay. Come on. - Your mother. She knew about your stepfather. She did. Don't cry. Natey Nate loves you, but it's a good thing for him you never had a chance to break his heart. You would have. You know, you would have. But don't worry. I'll mix your pieces. Yours and his. Love and art. What a composition. - Nathaniel's here. He's come for the girl. - I have your little friend here. She's terribly afraid. Poor girl, she will suffer. She told me to tell you that she loves you and that she's really frightened like a little kitten. - Coward. Coward. Coward. - Yeah, I'm scared, okay. But if I could, I'd do it again. - Nate. Help. - Psst. Ellie. It's Patrick. Ah. Why are you doing this to me? - Don't stop. Don't stop. Kill him. Kill him. - Stop. - No. No. - The frame. Get the frame. Get the frame. Get the girl. The girl. - Lily, Lily. You're gonna be. You're gonna be back on the road where we were, okay. Just get off. Don't look around. Don't. Get off the road quick. Okay? Okay. - Wendy. Nate. Kyle. Please stop. Stop. - You alone? Would you like a ride? - You know what you gotta do. - She killed them all. Master the pain, Nathaniel. It will obey. - Is that the deal? You offer revenge for what? My soul. You're not getting my soul and I'm not afraid of you. - Sweet little Archie. Don't you understand? That was for you. Do you think she just happened to be at that bus stop? I gave her to you. You owe me. You owe me. - Come on. Come on. - Stop. - No. No. No, you can't have my soul. I won't be like you. I am you. Ah. No. There are no perfect humans. But there's good enough. Ah. - Nate. Nate. What happened? Where is she? Where is she, Nate? - She murdered the only person who ever truly loved you. You would've had a family. That's all gone now. She took that from you. Master the pain, Lily. The art of punishment. It's transformational. - I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Let me out. Let me out. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No, no. No, no. You're not better than me. - Hi, yeah. There's been a break in. At Elle's Country Kitchen. - I was worried about you, hun. - I need to see it alone. - Well, try not to touch anything. - Imagine the possibilities. You're a natural.
