Come on! If we get 'em down there we won't have to bury 'em. That's a good idea. There's a cave up there. Sharon's spotted them, she's circling, come on, girls. Can you make it? Yeah. Okay, let's spread out. If you find him, kill him! Save that bitch for me. We're safe now. I think we lost them. Your shoulder looks bad. I don't get you. Why are you risking your neck for me? I don't know. I'll never understand these girls for as long as I live. And the way things are going, it may not be much longer. These broads, this gang, it's gonna kill people. You just don't fit. There, I think that'll hold it. At least it'll stop the bleeding. You're very pretty girl. Tell me, how did you get involved in this mess? Tell me, how did you get involved in this mess? How did you get involved in this mess? How did you get involved in this mess? How did you get involved in this mess? It started in Las Vegas. Instead of marrying me, my boyfriend gambled away our savings and then disappeared. I couldn't go back home and admit that my elopement was a failure. So, I had to take a job as a cocktail waitress in a Las Vegas nightclub. After a few weeks, I met the greatest thing that ever happened to me, Scotty Mason. ♪ Clothes only, cows and horseshoe ♪ ♪ Almost never wins anything ♪ ♪ Clothes only, cows and horseshoe ♪ ♪ But losing was as close as I came ♪ - And that little old lady in the front row, I thought for sure she was going to fall out of her chair. Yeah, but did you see that wild looking redhead giving me that old evil eye? Oh, Scott! Come on, you're just no good, you're rotten, all the way through. And I can't figure out how come I love you so very, very much. Hm, yeah. Do you know, sweetheart? You're not gonna really go for that redhead, too? I'm gonna get you! Hey! My only other friend was Libby. She was the star dancer at the club. Libby never had any trouble, at least she didn't show it. She watched over me like a mother hen. How's everything going? - Everything's fine, things couldn't be better. Since he came, I don't need anything else. For a while, I was in seventh heaven, and then the bottom fell out. Hey, baby, I need a cigarette. What's wrong, Scotty? Don't you want me anymore? Sure I do! Then come back to bed. I've got a job to hold down, can't you understand? I gotta sing at the club tonight. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, Scott. I don't wanna say anything that'll change. I'm sorry, I didn't mean it, I didn't mean it. I just don't want you to leave me, that's all. Just please promise me you'll never leave me. Just don't ever leave me, that's all, just don't. The next day, Libby saw him leave the redhead's apartment. I just had to find out where I stood. Scott, can I talk to you for just a minute? - Sandy, I'm busy. - Here he is, Scotty Mason. Well, I know, but please, I've gotta talk to you. All right. I've gotta go on now, I'll meet you at your place when I get off, we'll talk then. _ okay- ♪ Let me be free, let me be free ♪ ♪ Down on the corner of lonely street ♪ ♪ Between heartache and misery ♪ ♪ That's where you'll find me ♪ ♪ Waiting for the girl that he sees ♪ ♪ My best buddy took you off my hands ♪ Okay, what do you want? Hurry up, make it quick, I haven't got all night. Why, Scott? What went wrong between us? What did I do wrong? Nothing happened, you know, it wasn't you, it wasn't me. It's just one of those things, can I make you understand that? - Oh, Scott, please let's give it another chance. I know we could make it work, it'll be better, it'll be different. Please, I'll make it up to you. I just can't live without you. Look, Sandy, let's face facts, you know, it was fun while it lasted, wasn't it? You enjoyed yourself, I enjoyed myself, but you know the game's over now. It's finished, done, that's all, no more. Can I make you understand that? So why don't you just kinda jump up on your horse and ride out of this town? And ride back to that farm that you came from? And forget about me, you understand? Good night. Oh, my God. Hey! How many did you take? Hey! Come on, come on. Get up, how many did you take? I don't know. I don't think I took enough. I told you, men aren't worth it. Oh, Libby, what am I gonna do? I can't go back to work, I can't go home. I'm lost, there's no place for me to go. Are you up? Look, I belong to a group of girls and well they've all been through the same thing you have, and if they accept you, you can go out there and you can do whatever you want to be happy. - Just before sunrise, Libby and a girl called Pug picked me up for the trip to the ranch. Hi, Pug, meet Sandy. Hi, Pug. Hello, Sandy. Sandy, we'll have to blindfold you now. Go ahead, Pug. Okay, love. We can't let you know where the ranch is, just in case you're not accepted. - Being blindfolded on the long trip gave me a weird feeling, but I was determined to do anything to be accepted by Libby's friends. Don't be nervous, Sandy, it's initiation day. There'll be other new girls there. We're getting close, we're late damn it, I hope Grace won't be mad. - Just remember we're completely independent of men here. I know. You swear to obey the orders? - Well, that depends on what the orders are. Any order I give you, got that? Well, we haven't got all day. " Okay. Louder, we all want to hear you. " Yes. Thank you. What will you do if a man tries to follow you to this ranch? I know, no men are allowed here. I asked, what would you do? I'll kick him in the ass, I mean, I wouldn't allow it. Here come Libby and Pug with their new morsel. Hope she's choice. Let's see the morsel's beautiful eyes. Or did Libby bring us a sleeping beauty? - We don't give a damn about society's rules, we have our own laws here, you understand? How you can do anything you want, anything you want on this ranch, but don't disobey one of my orders. I'll do anything you say, Grace, no matter what it is. - All right, we'll test your desires to join. It takes guts to be free, Sandy. Let's find out how much you've got. Okay, Jacky, you're first, or do coffins bother you? You're gonna bury us in there? That's the general idea. Do we have to? You're not afraid of a little thing like that now, are you? But how can we breathe? Breathe? Oh, we'll take care of you. Well, how long are you gonna leave us in there? Till I decide to let you out. I'm sorry, Dennise, I just can't. Take this thing away. Your turn, Sue, get in. Okay, lay a little side in there. Let me out, please! Let me out, let me out. Let me out please! No, oh God, let me out! Open it up. Please! Let me out. Get outta here. I'm sorry, I lost my nerve. - I expected more of you, you punk. All right, Libby, let's see if your cutie can take it. Okay, let's dig her up. Sadie, Dennise, drop the other girls off. Don't forget the blindfolds. After lunch, Mary Wilson, another new girl, and I had to prove our horsemanship. It was an important part of the initiation. While we were waiting, Sadie put on a show. Show 'em who's boss. Should have taken a bath, Sadie. Treat him like a man. Move, Sadie. Yeah, listen to Sadie. Go Sadie, go. Yeah, woo! All she's proving is she can whip that horse. You'll get a chance to show us what you can do. Easy boy, easy, easy, easy boy. Come on now, that's all right. That's all right, easy, easy. Crazy broad. - Why didn't you tell me Sharon was coming in? I wasn't sure, come on up girls. One of you saddle your horses, be ready to show your stuff when we get back. Come on, let's get going. Hi, you're the two new girls, ain't you? Yeah, that's right. And what's your name? Well, my name's Sandy, and that's Mary. You know, I sure done you a good turn. What do you mean by that? I broke these two ponies myself. ~ Oh! You know, I used to be the head stuntman in the United States, that's what they said. Well, we're supposed to show off on those horses. Oh, don't you worry about that, you be nice to them, they'll be nice to you. Sharon, baby. - Hi, Sharon, how are you? - Hi. Hey, how was Europe? - Oh, pretty groovy I have to say, for myself. - Hey, I hear you got hung up with a race car jockey. - I'll have you know it was a Grand Prix winner, sweetie. Give you a good ride? Baby, I showed him gears he's never even seen before. Hey, Grace, now that Sharon's here does that mean we get to go to Mexico? You bet your ass we're going to Mexico. - Yahoo! So you're not too tired? Are you kidding? It's been a long time, Sharon. Yeah, it's been too long. I wonder who the girl on the plane is. Oh, that's Sharon Miller. She is the Queen B around this hive. Loaded with dough, she's got enough money to last two lifetimes, but she's a junkie. She won't live long enough to spend half of it. - You girls take your horses out at the corral, I'll meet ya in a minute. - Ha ha. Oh, Ms. Grace, these horses haven't been great in two weeks. Can't you get those girls to do- I told you to do that, Monti. Well, I. Take care of my horse. So you missed me, huh? No, I didn't miss you baby, I missed your magic. No one does it like me, huh? No one does it like you. Would you shut up and do it? All the same but you, Sharon. You have it? Yeah, I got it. Hang on. That night we headed for Mexico. For me, it was the first time to cross a border illegally. Libby told me there's a small town just across the border that the girls use as their playground. We were about to cross the river into Mexico when... What the hell is this? I don't know, he must have moved in since the last time we crossed the border. Well, isn't there any other way to cross the river? Nah, too far away. - Christ, he's got a fence right across the trail. - Let's see if we can persuade him to move. Come out of there, spick. - Look, we don't like greasers around here, so I suggest you pack up and get outta here, got that? Come on, girls! Flamin' wetback, who does he think he is? Nobody gets in our way, understand? Let's get going, I'm thirsty. Blow, greaser. And next time we'll chop off more than your water. Yeah, yeah! Ha, ha. Get off. - Yahoo! - Yahoo! Don't anybody drink the water. Don't crowd me, Sadie! I think we hit it right. Here we go! Hey, Chico for you tonight. I'm selecting, though. It's my birthday! Bill, I see you made it, like wow, it's been so long. Bill, let's go outside. Welcome to Mexico, senorita. You could see me more often. But you don't know how to get to the ranch. So, I drew you a diagram. Now, see right here's my room. Mhm. Hey, don't let anybody see you, understand? Hey, wanna go for a ride? Come on! Oh, baby, it's been so long. Come on, Libby, darling. Not now, baby, later. Please dance for Ceasar now. Ole! Go, Libby! Ole, Ole! Ah, hey! Ole! Oh, mamacita, I would like to smother myself in you. Why not? A little match like yours could never light my fire. “ Ole! Do you have a place where we can go? Sure, just down the street. - Do you always have to have hot pants, Sharon? - Just leave me alone, I'll do what I wanna do when I wanna do it. Ole, ole! Ole, ole, oh, okay! Yahoo! I care about the little girl. Where is the stuff? Chico, where is the stuff? You are sitting on it. Give it to him, yeah! - It is pure, I have tested it myself. You may get your money then. How about it, Grace? Business, Chico. My contact's leaving on Sunday. Make sure I get the rest of the stuff on time. Let's go, damn it. That wetback's still here? Look at him feeding his pigs. Why don't you pack it up, wetback? - Senorita, I build this place. You really must be stupid. I sure don't envy him. I thought we told you to get outta here. Okay, senorita. Some people never listen, do they? Maybe we should teach him a lesson. Shall we, Grace? Yeah. - Oh, come on. - Come on, do it. Let him go. Come on! And that's the last warning you'll get, wetback. But why me, senorita? Come on! How's if one of those girls came in here and saw that trunk open? - Oh, Ms. Grace, nobody come up here, but you. - You leave that trunk closed till I get in here. Ms. Grace, when are you gonna start treating me like a man? - The only thing I ever promised you, Monti, was money. You know that ain't true. You know it ain't true. Ms. Grace, I'm crazy for you. I, that's why I work so hard for you. Monti, you're making more money that you've ever made before in your life. It isn't that. If you'd only just be nice to me again. Look, Mon“, I'm “red. Maybe some other time, huh? But when, when? Maybe Saturday night. - Saturday, Wednesday, Thursday. Friday, yeah, and Saturday. Oh, oh, oh. What in hell are we doing here? Taking a leak. I keep thinking about that Dennise. Sure like to catch her in a short mini skirt at a low drinking fountain. That won't be necessary, she digs you. Yeah? When are you gonna see her again? Oh, Saturday, probably. If I can wait that long. I don't run out of walls to climb, huh? She will keep. Yeah, but Will I? Hey, you know, she gave me a map that shows how to go to the ranch where she's staying. I was thinking maybe, uh... Oh, the only problem is that guys aren't allowed in there, though. Hey, let's sneak in. Yeah, tomorrow we go into town, Dick up my unemployment. Yeah. And you drive me to the ranch, drop me off and pick me up later. Let's go back into the city and have a nice cool beer. Now, you're talking. Where you been? To come over. Long time no see, where you been? I got busted. I've been in the slummer for about nine months. Well, what are you doing here? I thought, I'd stop by for a couple of days. I'm on my way to New York, I scored a job. Oh, no, come on in. The gang's gonna love to see you. - Sure, great! So what's been going on? I love Westerns. Were you really a stuntman, Monti? You know what we used to do? We used to leave the studio at three o'clock in the morning, go out in the rocks, 40 miles out. Climb onto your old horse, and they'd say, fall off. Where do you fall off? They'd say, right by that rock. No, they weren't gonna shovel it up like they do now. Fall by the rock, and if you didn't fall by the rock, you fell off the rock. Oh, Gosh! I don't want you taking up too much of Monti's time, he's too valuable to me around here. Oh, thank you, Ms. Grace, but I didn't exactly like the way- - That wasn't said for your benefit, Monti, it was said for hers. Fix these. What's the matter with her? Oh, Ms. Grace is all right. You just don't understand her. She's a wonderful girl, she is, she's got problems, that's all. Why, once you get to know Ms. Grace, you can't help but love her. And I mean that, I mean every word of it. I'll get you as close to the ranch as I can, but I think you're crazy. If they catch you, it won't be worth it. Be careful, man. Sadie, are you spending the night in there? I'd like to take a shower, damn it. - You're in a lather already, love. Why don't you go outside and wait for a cloud burst? Very funny! Just hurry up. Time's up, get the hell outta there. Coming, Grace, I'm coming. Come on. Hey, I'm outta breath already, that's no fun. That's nice. Come here. Anytime I take a shower, we're outta hot water. You know, Grace, I've been thinking, there's one rule here I don't really care for. No men? Mhm. - But we agreed from the very beginning. It's a shame. This ranch would be perfect for it. Look, Sadie, I'm not turning this place into a brothel, not even for you. I know, but what do you think this is, Grace? Grace's finishing school for Waywood girls? Anyway, it's a tough rule to keep. But so far we've kept it. Have we? Everybody knows there's no men allowed on this ranch. And if somebody doesn't? What are you trying to do, Sadie? Tell me something? Maybe I already have. What can you lay in our barn besides eggs? Oh, yeah? Mhm. Well, we'll see about that. Oh, you are so good. Don't ever shave it, you understand? Dennise, over there. You, get out. Come on, there's an extra stud in the stable. Yeah, strictly bare men. - You know I don't allow any men on this ranch. All right, Grace, I'm sorry. We're gonna have to teach you a lesson, boy, so you don't come back to this ranch again. What are we gonna do to him? Watch him. Get him, girls. Get him, get him. - Dennise got herself a special mount. Get him! Oh, I hate men. Okay, okay, all right. Look, I'm gonna get outta here, huh, and I won't come back. That's what you think, buster. You're not getting off that easily. Grace, let's put the sign on him. All right, get him ready. Grace, do you have to? What is it, Dennise, him or the club? Sharon, I wanna talk to you alone. Sure. We'll be going across tonight to pick up the rest of the stuff. - Good, 'cause I'm leaving tomorrow, you know. Yeah, I'm gonna talk to Monti. So get rid of him, Grace. We don't need him anymore. He knows too much. - Well then do something about it. Oh, I had to cover you. Look, anyway, he knows you fly outta here pick up the stuff and deliver it to me. - Look, Grace, I'm telling you in a nice way. When I first started this business, it was because I needed the smack and you needed the money. Now, if there's gonna be any hassle at all, I'll just go someplace else and get it, that's all. This place has been safe for you. - Well, you better make sure it's that way. Look, I'll get rid of him. That night we went back across the border to Mexico. We didn't see the Mexican squatter and had no trouble crossing the river. - What's the matter with you girls tonight? No fun! - We're all a little tired tonight, that's all. I know what the trouble is. It's too much of that good, gringo life. Oh, yeah! - I love to kiss the back of your neck. So warm, you set me on fire. All right, everybody, who's man enough to have me all night, huh? Come on, line up, come on, suckers. Baby, Pablo. I want you all to show me, come on after. Come on, let's have a Yahoo. Get on! ' Ole! Come on, you guys. Stick it to him, Sadie. Ah, senorita, you are going my way? They were playing a game, which everyone in the village seemed to know, a game of catch the brass ring. Only the prize wasn't a brass ring, it was a girl. You are so nice, senorita. Same quality? On my mother. You have the money? - Oh, Chico, go back to your. Come on, Chiquito, she's no good, she's weak. You wanted the two of us, eh, Chico? - Woo, there she goes. - All right, girls, the party's over. Come on, line up, let's get back to the ranch. On our way back, we discovered that the Mexican squatter had fenced the trail. The look on Grace's face frightened me. Barb wire, that Mexican's not leaving. Come on, girls, let's show him what barb Wire's really for. Come one, babe. We warned you, greaser. Come outta there or we'll smoke you out. Girls, get him out. Yeah, get him out. - Yahoo. - Senorita. Ha, let's get him. Run, little man, run. Get him, Pug! Wrap him in his own wire. Come on, Pug, give me a smooth ride to the tree. Let's have a bonfire. Burn, baby, burn. - Ah, ha, make it. - Come on. Okay, give it to him. Yeah! Harder! Give it to him! Harder, give it to him! You heard my rules! We'll get you, you heard my words. - Libby, are you going back to Vegas tomorrow? - If I don't wanna get fired, I am, are you? I don't know yet. I'm not sure what I'm going to do. How did Grace get Sharon to bankroll this club? Grace and Sharon have been friends for a long time. Grace's father used to have a lot of money, then someone cheated him and. - Maybe that explains the type of woman she is. Just don't get in her way, and you won't have any trouble. What the hell are you doing? Oh, Ms. Grace. Well, you know, it's Saturday night, you promised. Well, I changed my mind. Oh, you can't do that, you can't change your mind. I said, I changed my mind, Monti. Look, that's the last time you'll ever point this thing at me, the last time. Monti, you're, hurting me, Monti. I know I'm hurting you. I'm mean too, for all the times you've hurt me, understand? All right, all right, you win. Now shut up. Everything from here on, is business with you and me. Every dollar you make, I want half of it. All right, all right. No, you're just making up another lie. No, no, I mean it, Monti. This time I mean it. Ms. Grace, do you really mean it? Oh, I, I hurt you. Open the box. Open the trunk. I Will. Get out the stuff. Okay, stuntman, this will be your last big one, your specialty, a real drag. A bunch of girls running around acting like wild animals? Doesn't figure. Listen, it's not gonna make things any better if you sit around here and brood over it. They'll get theirs. Believe me you always get paid one way or another. I know you wanna go get even, I would, too, but all you're gonna do is get yourself in trouble. Look, if you don't say something pretty soon, I'm gonna pack up and go back to that damn construction job, and leave you down here in the desert to lick your wounds. This coffee is awful. Look, I'm gonna go down to the river and get some cold water. See if you can get yourself sobered up. It was early in the morning. I rode off alone. I needed to be by myself. The callousness of the gang frightened me. Easy boy, 93$)'- Where in the hell is Monti? I'm tired of lugging his crap around. - I don't know, he got drunk again last night. Better do it yourself. I made up my mind to get out. Some people never learn. - Hey, you took the words right out of my mouth. Get lost! Look, first I wanna talk to you for just a minute, all right? - We got rules, no one's allowed on this ranch. Yeah, I understand about rules. I mean, I got a certain, a code of my own, you know? Like, I can't remember the words. Oh, hey, I brought you some flowers. I just remembered. I just remembered, it was something about do to others as they do to you. Yeah, it's all coming back to me now. Hey, thanks for the cross, you know? Get out, you son of a bitch, I'll kill you. You just killed you. Help! Help! You didn't have to kill him. He tried to rape me. Somebody's coming. Out of the barn! You killed him. Girls! Too bad, your friend here tried to kill me. Tie him to the post. You must be mad, you'll never get away with this. Tighter, he can take it. Did he get a good chunk? All right, Grace, what are we gonna do? Look, I think we oughta call the police. - Wait a minute, give me a chance to think. Look, I go along with most things, but this guy's dead. That's his fault. Don't worry about him, he's the guy we gotta worry about. - Well, we could arrange an awful accident. Why don't we put them in their truck and roll them over the cliff? You guys are crazy. I'm going for the police. No, you don't. Mary, get me another bra, so hurry. - Can't any of you girls see she's crazy? Or are you all nuts? Okay, girls, get the horses ready. I decided to play it cool until I could find a chance to get away. That's when I saw you tied up in the barn. All right, come on, over the top. Okay, come on, jump. How the hell do we get out of here? Back up. Hey! Sandy's taking off with the guy. - C'mon up, all of you, it's them or us. After them, we've got to stop them. Let's go. Mary, side up and open the gate. Let's go, damn it. Dennise and Sharon, get to the plane, and cut 'em off. The rest of you, follow me. Don't forget the gun, Dennise. Go for their tires. That's the how and why of it. I see, I feel better now. Let's get outta here. The girls must have gone back to the ranch by now. We'll start going back to the car. Girls, go up there. Sadie, Dennise, come with me. You can rest for a while. There's no sign of them yet. Every girl I have ever known has had just one thing in mind, what she could get. And here you are, carrying me around, looking after me. Maybe we better get moving. I checked the ravine, no sign of him. They must be headed for the falls. Yeah, they'll need water. Pug, check that creek. We'll head for that right. I saw something in the ravine leading to the falls. Let's go, we'll find them. Up here, we spread out. All of you, check the area where they left the car. Dennise, you come with me. We'll catch them at the exit of the falls. I'll kill them both. - Look, Grace, I think this is going too far, for my taste anyway. I dug the club and all of that, but I'm not riding into a triple murder for anybody. - Is it because of your friend in the barn? You can think and do whatever you want, Grace, but I'm splitting. Yeah, you do that, sweetheart. I am. So long, Grace. Why, you stupid little bitch! - Oh, Ms. Grace, you shouldn't have done that.
