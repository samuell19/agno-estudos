I'm so thirsty! After sleeping for 50 years I'm parched. I'm coming back to life... No one in Sainte-Lucie had any idea what was behind Mr Walker's boarded up window. My brother Olivier was the first to find out. Now we're setting out on a dangerous adventure. All because of Olivier and so on... So you put the others up to it? No. I wasn't there when they found that room. What were you doing in Mr Walker's house? Robbing him while he was away? Not even that? Just for kicks, was it? All we need is one good reason. You're a good kid, Olivier. We know you meant no harm. Tell us the whole truth, no tall stories. I've told you the truth ten times already. - How long will you keep me? One last time, okay? No tall stories. Just the truth. Fine. I'll tell you the truth one more time. Since you insist... You're inviting a friend over for a weekend of games. Time allowed, two hours. Length of essay... 150 words. Let's say this is your paper, all right? Top right-hand-side corner, write the place and the... Claude Petit and Beno?t Painchaud! Give that to me. Ah, this explains your rapid progress in maths. Where did you get this? I found it in the playground. We'll see about it on Monday 8 a.m. in the principal's office. Lucky for you he's away today. There are two words I want you to use three times. Olivier... Five pages on the importance of paying attention in class. That's for fooling around behind my back. Start now. Set your watches. He hasn't gone. His coat's in there. Hi, Beno?t. Thanks for your poem. It was really cool. - Well, see you. So you write poems? Just go and look for him, will you? Laurent Saint-Pierre! Exactly what are you doing here? I'm writing a novel. Close the door. You've got a nerve! Out of my locker. And take this off. Maniac! Stupid school. Can't a guy work in peace? Idiot. Hi, Beno?t. Can I have my notebook? I don't have it. Mrs Blanchette confiscated it. You swore you'd be careful. If I get into trouble... I didn't tell on you. I said I found it in the playground. I was looking for you to warn you. Fine. I'll say I lost it. What about Saturday? Still taking me to a film? Oh, yes. No problem. Okay. I meant to tell you, your poem was great. My, aren't we a ladies' man! Did you find anything? We forgot the toilets. Let's go. Stay near to locker, No?l. - You do that side. Out you come, Olivier Saint-Pierre. We know you're in there. Come out, Olivier, or we'll break the door down. Why do you always disturb me? It's not fair. Stop an artist from working and mankind suffers. Did you know that? Never mind. We'll settle this later. Just a sec. Why are they all avoiding me? Who can they all forget about me? Anyway... I don't even have real friends. And I'd better watch myself. I'm seeing things in class. That's not normal. Stupid, boring life. Did you think we'd forgotten you? Quiet, Jack Tar. - Seen him? - And you? You're in trouble too, sailor! He can't be far away. Jack Tar! Leave me alone. I don't know you. Anyway... What exactly are you? I am Philippe Ambroise Dubuc de Beauch?ne. Famous nephew to the illustrious Chevalier de Beauch?ne de Cuba. A brother of the Coast, like him. My war names are Double Edge and Tooth of the Night. Keep back. Now, now, sailor. What frightens you so? You would look no worse had you seen... a ghost. But then, if truth be told, I am a ghost. Leave me alone. I'm no fool. I know ghosts don't exist. What a doubting disposition. - Is indisputable proof needed? So be it. Look at this, sailor. Tell me if a mere mortal can do this. Awful, isn't it? Ghosts have ingenious tricks for terrifying the living. It's their favourite pastime. I'm quite the beginner. This is my only trick. Still, it's rather tedious. In real life, I did worse. I terrorised the Seven Seas. All I humbly seek is your friendship, my boy. What do you want from me? I'm under a spell. I must return to the living for three days twice a century. I then enlist the help of the first person I meet who shares my birthday. Now sailor, something tells me that today is your birthday. Who told you? I know because I have to. Take my head. Here he is, quick. - Where? Where? No one's here. He must be under there. It leads to Walker's yard. Ouch. You're squashing my fingers, stupid. The scoundrel took my tricorn. All the same... - We foiled the enemy, sailor. They wouldn't harm me if they caught me. Where are we? - Is this Mr Walker's house? Back in my day, this house was an inn. And I died here, in this very room. If you died here, how exactly did you die? Through treachery and love. I was here to settle some business for my uncle. As it was winter, I was fated to meet ladies all sad that their husbands had gone logging. Courtesy required that I entertain them with my stories. Eventually, I arrived here. This remote little inn was perfect for my secret mission. I was welcomed by a most ravishing beauty. Never had I met a lady so graceful, so charming, and with such a sweet temperament... My friend, I instantly fell in love with this dream lady who, for her part, seemed to share my feelings. The vixen! Was I to know she'd kill me that night, probably to rob me? I suppose so... I must have been poisoned. When I awoke I was a ghost. That night would have proven fatal anyway for three men had come to the inn to slay me, sent by my uncle's arch enemy Captain Monbars. His life ends tonight. Consider it done. The poison saved me from their swords. Instead of killing me, they too were poisoned by me sweet lady. You're in love with the person who poisoned you! Indeed I am. Madly. I died dreaming of her. I have been dreaming of her continuously for 250 years. What an impression she made! - What is your name, sailor? Also, the Daydreamer. I'm often absent-minded. Well Olivier, I need you to break the spell that made me a ghost. Will you help me, my friend? Yes, but what do I have to do? Very little. You have to bring me a golden cylinder from the Dominican Fathers. Inside, there's a parchment addressed to my uncle. When I deliver it to him, the spell will be broken. I shall cease to be a ghost. Okay. I'll help you. I have to go. My parents will be worried. Come with me. You'll be my guest. That's not a good idea, sailor. I might frighten your friends. Come on! Hello. Anybody home? Anybody home? I'm back. Dad? Mum? Are you home? Laurent! Surely you're home! Cut it out. You'll wake the dead. Are you all alone? Are Mum and Dad out? Yeah. Carole Bonin is minding us. - You're home late. Why are you staring? What's up? Nothing. Just checking you put your things away for once. I've brought a friend for dinner. Where is he? That's weird. He was here a minute ago, right behind me. Aren't you a bit old for imaginary friends? He's not imaginary. He was just here. Fine. I'll be in the dining room. And put your boots away. Sailor! I saw people. It's a trap. We should leave while we can. - A trap? Here? - Kids or grown-ups? Don't worry. I'll go see to it. I'll handle it. I'll wait here till they show up. If they touch you, I'll fly to the rescue. Good idea. Bye. Happy birthday, Olivier. You really tricked me. You always play tricks. Tonight's our turn. - Blow out the candles. Looks like we picked a bad day to sort him out. It would look bad. Check out that cake! There's bound to be some left over. You'll cope, won't you? Hurry, I don't want to be late. Cantin can be so cranky. We won't be late. We're just taking a client out. Don't worry, Mrs Saint-Pierre. We'll be fine. - Hurry up. - Call us if you need to. Far out! The decor is a bit wild. Olivier's mum did it. She's a sculptor. Looks a bit old for modern art. Ooh, it's soft. The Saint-Pierres have weird tastes. Why are these walls so thin, one can't even hide in them? Coming. Hi. So it's your birthday? Yeah... We've come to say happy birthday. Thanks. That's nice. - This isn't much. - Can we take our boots off? Hi, Beno?t. I didn't know you were invited. Come on in. Philippe? Mr de Beauch?ne? Are you there? You've put some icing on the wall. The Cold Shivers album! - How did you get hold of it? Let's play it and dance. Try not to break anything. And no mess. Roll up the rug. Didn't you say you'd give me that tape? Well, I know. I was just waiting for their next album. That'd be a nicer present. Are you mad at me? I've never seen your eyes so big and fiery before. It's kind of nice. Do you mind me saying that? Where did you get that hat? What are you waiting for? Hey! Beno?t's kissing H?l?ne. Come and see, quick! - Get lost, kid. - Beat it, brat. Look, he's covered in lipstick. Are you jealous? Want some too? Let me go. That's disgusting. Why are you hiding, sir? I have to. Three scoundrels are after me. I feel they're nearby. May I hide with you? Don't tell anyone about me. Beauch?ne's in that house. I can't see him, but I feel him. El Diablo! We're cold... All right, but be quick. And be discreet. Thank you. How can you walk through walls? That's a very long story, Jack Tar. And a sad one at that. You see, I'm a ghost. - Do you understand? - Doesn't it scare you? I'm not afraid of people who are different. I'm not racist. Hey guys, check out those two jerks. More bloody migrants coming to steal our jobs. See that? - Yours or mine? A bunch of cowards. Sad times! - Wait for me. - Why can't I go with you? I'll tell Mum. Why is H?l?ne going? Because she's a girl? Dumbo! I'm taking her because it's my business. - Will you mention the ghost? You know what I mean. As if you met ghosts every day. Don't you dare mention it to anyone, okay? I'm called a Daydreamer already. I don't want to be Crackpot too. I don't get it. Are you ashamed you met a real ghost? Be proud of it. If you must follow me, at least shut up. Wait here. - Hi, H?l?ne. Would you like to go to the Seminary museum with me? What? A museum? Sounds boring. Over here, sailor. Keep quiet. Hurry. He went this way. His footprints lead that way. Wait! Useless fools! Can't you see he went this way? Follow me. Tricked you, old rogues. Here's a lesson for you. I ran backwards to the window, ran three times in a circle, ran back to the road and carefully retraced my steps to the window. Simple. If those yokels follow my tracks they'll go in two directions, both of which are wrong since I'm here, cosy and warm. - Does that make sense to you? Are you off to the museum with Olivier? No, it might be better if I stayed hidden here till those three thugs vanish over the horizon. I won't tell anyone you're in here. Laurent! You're still here! Go home right now. - I'll wait outside, H?l?ne. - Are you going with him? He won't say it, but he has to steal a thing from the museum. You see, on his birthday Olivier met a ghost. No dead person can touch that thing. It's cursed. So the ghost asked Olivier to get it for him. You're really cracked, Laurent. Beyond repair. - Are you ready, H?l?ne? Forever hunted, ever the fugitive. Am I doomed to suffer thus for all eternity? 200 years of bone-chilling cold unsuited to human pleasure. And yet the ardour of love still burns within me... Will I see you again, my beautiful poisoner? And where, if not in the realm of the dead? Still, it would be much better than eternity without you. Damn it all to hell. Why slay me the very night love was to claim us? Ours is a sad fate, my lovely. I came to a sad end. Oh well, to your health, my love! But how is it possible that in some 91,232 days spent in slumber I never once dreamed of any other woman? I knew enough women to fill 20 lads' dreams. What devilry has befallen me? Enough, stupid fools. You know the thing's cursed. I taught history for 43 years... 28 of them in missions. It's most edifying for poor nations to know their history, even if it consists of deeds that aren't exactly edifying! I'm almost as old as this museum. Maybe not quite. But just as neglected, without a doubt. After a fire destroyed the north wing of the Seminary we put everything in the old chapel. Here we are. The bequest of Robert Chevalier de Beauch?ne. Read the inscription. His end drawing near, Beauch?ne felt remorse for his crimes. He sought a pardon from the Church and the Law. A document from the Bishop and the Governor attests that it was granted. However the messenger sent to collect it never arrived. In Cuba, legend has it that since his death Robert de Beauch?ne's soul wanders... outside the gates of hell in the hope that one day he may receive his pardon. Chevalier de Beauch?ne was rather superstitious. He wanted his pardon kept in a specially made gold case. Look. It's covered with sacred symbols. They seem more pagan than Catholic. Where's all the rest from? In those days, the Church would clear ill-gotten fortunes in exchange for gifts. What you see here was difficult to trade. Gold and silver coins would have, it seems, helped build the Seminary, although we have no proof. What about all that stuff over there? It's from all over the world. Thailand, Burma, China... Egypt, even. Everything is genuine... Why couldn't Beauch?ne fetch his pardon himself? It was far too dangerous. Anyone could have denounced him, had him hanged, and then... shared his treasure with the judge, witnesses and lawyers! Beauch?ne needed his pardon first. - What of his messenger? He was Beauch?ne's nephew. A young braggart. A libertine, an awful womaniser according to our information. When he didn't return, his irate uncle asked a voodoo priestess to cast a spell on him. He's been condemned to roam the earth, dead or alive. until his mission is finally completed. - Sorry. H?l?ne, we must go. Already? Do you have enough material for you project? Fine... Come back whenever you like. Goodbye. We must stop that boy! If Philippe gets the pardon, Monbars will kill us. Friends, what have we to fear? How can the boy reach Philippe de Beauch?ne now that we've taken care of him? No, let him carry the pardon since we can't quite grasp it. Just be patient, and for now grab all this. It will pacify Monbars and make him overlook our delay. Burglary at the Seminary. Why deny yourself anything? The plot thickens, youngster. I only took the pardon. That's all I touched. I even decided to return it and Philippe vanished and I was stuck with it. I was afraid this ghost story would end badly. Too right. It won't end well for you. Tell me it was a prank for the school carnival. I'll believe any sensible story. I only took the pardon. The pirates took the rest. Pirates, Ghosts. He must think we're idiots. - I'm sick of your lies! Then be quiet and listen. That night, my parents freaked over the missing rum and brandy which was locked in the kitchen cupboard. They thought we did it. We were sent to our bedroom. Laurent... Look, these three aren't statues. The flash turned their eyes red because they're real eyes. They want the pardon too. Philippe never told me. You're scared. You know, it's not normal to see ghosts. I'd better stop before I grow up. I could be locked up like a loony. I'm right, you're scared. Little pest. Leave me alone, scribbler. You may be older, but I bet that before you sleep you check for monsters under your bed, scaredy-cat. It's easy to rhyme with H?l?ne. many words end in ?ne. With Julie, it's harder. Julie, yours truly... then what? - Julie, yours truly, hot chilli! Rhymes are no big deal. Once the girls find out what you're up to, you're dead. Beno?t's been odd lately. - He's cheating on me. - Julie Laviolette What should I do? Simple. We girls must show we're smarter. How? Just scratch his eyes out. Honestly! You're late again, guys. We'll never be ready. Not in months. Get moving. What is this abomination? Let's go, quick! Olivier's been kidnapped... They took him! Stop, guys. Cut the music. They've taken Olivier. They came into our bedroom. Three guys with sick faces, old guns and lots of knives. They took him to the secret spot, the one behind Walker's. That's them, with red eyes. - It won't open. Keep trying, it's moving. - That's my ghetto blaster! If I never see Olivier again, I'll tell all in a novel. Where's all this stuff from? We've found the pirates' lair. But no one's here. Not even Olivier. I'm next to H?l?ne. The pirates could be right here, hiding in all this junk. There sure is a lot of stuff. And it hasn't been cleaned for ages. Look! I've found a door. The wood's warm. - Can you hear that? Relax, will you? A tropical beach at Walker's? Give us a break. I give up. This is unbelievable. It simply makes no sense. Liars always end up contradicting themselves. Those who tell the truth often get mixed up. How does the kid do it? Excuse me, I asked you not to smoke. This is a public building. It's not allowed. Can I go on? This is where the story gets interesting. Now we knew what was behind Walker's old window. A door through time and space. To allow Philippe back to his uncle's days once he had the pardon. We must be dreaming, This isn't normal. It may seem like a dream but we're in it for real. Hurry! Look at these. - Fur coats? Wait for me. I have to pee. Be quick. We must hurry. - Really, guys! You scoundrel, trying to drown me so abominably! Come and see! Help me, you little scamp. Come back, you snot-nosed kid. There's a head! Why, you're friends of Olivier the Daydreamer! Who's that character? He's the ghost Olivier met. - Help me dig him out. Thank you! My gratitude for your help is equal only to my shame at meeting you in such a humiliating position. There were three pirates. I could have easily routed them had they not taken me off-guard, deviously struck me down and meanly dumped me. Too late, his brain's cooked. Was it those three? Precisely. El Diablo, El Cachiporra and El Moribundo. Cut-throats in the pay of Monbars the Exterminator, My uncle Beauch?ne's sworn enemy. - They took Olivier. Blast! If Monbars steals the pardon, my uncle will be livid. Egad, the wine's gone off. How tragic! You may never see your brother again. We'll find him and set him free. You'll be risking a lot for him. - Are you willing? I suppose so. Then get me out. And let's hope we're not too late. Look what I found. Cachiporra's scarf. We're on the right track. Hurry! What if they're waiting to ambush us? Come this way. It seems we're out of luck. We've reached a dead-end. They can't have climbed that! Only birds can get up there. Those clues were too easy. They put us on the wrong track. What a disaster. Look! I've found a cave. A cave? Get the bundle, guys. We need our torches. I don't like this. - There's a rowing boat. Yes. There's an underground river. Be careful, it's really slippery. Shall we get on the boat? The devil only knows where it will lead us. There's only one way to find out. Let's go. - Are those bats dangerous? Here we go. Careful now. It's so cold down here. Hey, look! There's the way out. It's beautiful. It's different. It's so beautiful. At last! - Mr Philippe... Can we eat these? You'd get heartburn. It's a kurrajong pod. It contains a powder that gets through the skin and caused unbearable itching. Ideal for prisoners who won't pay a ransom. They become more generous, if less healthy... Natural itchy powder! Great! Let's take some. Look, a rope. The one they tied Olivier with. We're on the right track. We'll catch up with them. - Is it far? I'm hungry. Has anyone got something to eat? All right, so I go lost. We'll do better tomorrow. Meanwhile, let's eat. This is good. It will go down well. Wild pigs love it. Roots are good. Were you ever short of food at sea? Yes. Many times on my uncle's ship we had nothing left but the soles of our shoes, our gloves or knife handles. And when that was gone we turned to mast grease, cockroaches and rat droppings. Spiders could have spun webs between our teeth Had we not managed to catch a shark. - What are rat droppings like? What a life! Indeed, a sailor's life was a very cruel one. But for buccaneers, life was much better. We were our own masters. We shared the same food. The crew elected a captain who could be dismissed if deemed unjust or cowardly. Besides, each buccaneer had to sign the charter. What's a charter? A contract setting out everybody's share of the booty as well as compensation for various battle injuries. - Like a work policy. - A work policy. What you said, but for today. - What I said, for today... What was that? That, what is it? Nothing to fear, sir. It's just a wawaron. - A wawa what? That? A frog? By Jove! It sounded just like a lion. Do I know about lions! I killed enough in Mexico. There are no lions in Mexico. There are no lions there now. Mr Philippe, May I go on? - Go ahead Jack Tar. A buccaneer, rather. A famous one at that... "Pretty girl, how I love your bright jewel eyes, "your carnival-queen smile..." He's so sweet. "Lovely princess, I would do anything for you "if only you would kiss me, Julie..." "Julie." You little creep! - What was that for? Don't say you didn't ask for it, Painchaud. What happened? Mr Philippe? Will we find my brother? Will we get lost in the forest and never get home? - Wow, check this! - Look, some smoke. - We'll ask the people. Show them the painting. - What did they say? It seems they were just here, with Olivier. Let's go after them. Look down there! - Quiet, they'll hear you. What rotten luck. I'm afraid we're too late. We might be able to... - They may not all be like him. I'm sure it's their weak spot. I've got an idea. Let's make a pea-shooter. We'll take the rowing boat... - Is it time? Pull the canvas over your heads. - Get down. At last I can stuff myself! I know... El Diablo's manners are rather off-putting. He's a boor. He's a peasant. So he didn't explain at all why he brought you here? No sir, he didn't. Do you know what's inside the case you're wearing around your neck? Yes. Chevalier de Beauch?ne's pardon. Indeed, my friend Beauch?ne's pardon. Open the case and give me the pardon. I'll hand it to my friend in person. He'll be so pleased. No! Only give me the pardon. I don't want the case. Keep it as a souvenir, for your trouble. I only want the pardon. As soon as I have it, Cachiporra will take you home. Open it yourself. It's Monbars. - Let's go back while we can. Happy birthday, my boy. The good captain wanted this day to be a special one just for you. Meet my daughter Evelyne. You're early with the cake, daughter. Am I? Sorry, Father, I thought I heard you call. I didn't call, as you well know. Why don't you blow out the candles, Olivier? Go on. Make a wish and blow. There are too many. Go ahead, try. Sea air strengthens the lungs. Well done, Olivier. Your wish will come true. Happy birthday. Don't believe a word he says. He's tricking you. Enough, Evelyne. Go back to your seat. That's her! My beloved, my lovely poisoner. It's no time to swoon over a girl. You're in no position to give advice. All right. I'm off. As your wish will be granted, tell me what it was. To see you mum again? For Philippe to get this and stop being a ghost. What? Philippe, a ghost? That's right. He asked me for help. You saw Philippe? Where is he? Enough! Don't ever mention that braggart again. He's caused enough harm to his uncle, my friend. Open that and give me the pardon. No way. In that case... no cake for you. Take him out. The night air will change his mind. Don't jump overboard. The bay is full of sharks. They'd be overjoyed. We'll talk again tomorrow. The boy irritates me. He's put me in a foul mood. If I don't calm down, I'll do something wild. Something wild... Yes, to put me back in a good mood. Don't move. Everybody stay put. Let's play spin the bottle. Do you believe in hell, El Moribundo? Well, I do. And if I get my hands on Beauch?ne's pardon, I'll make sure I don't see you there. You're a hard man to kill, El Moribundo. Maybe even the devil won't have you. Zounds! It's too quiet. I don't like it. This fog... with a full moon... It's a bad omen. Maybe for you, but the dice have smiled on me. I've won all your gold! You shouldn't laugh. In this kind of fog spirits come to haunt the seas. Know what happens if a spirit finds you asleep? It gets inside you head... through your nostrils and eats your brain. Shut up and play. Why would spirits bother with your nostrils? You sleep with your mouth open. Don't make me suffer any more. How can I see Philippe? I don't know. He didn't come for the case. Let go! Trying to kill me again, my sweet? Don't you love me as much as I love you? Philippe! I'm glad to see you! So you've come to get me? - Yes! Now those pirates need a good lesson. - What? We can't let them come back for us at home. We have a foolproof plan. Believe me, they won't be following us. The poison wasn't for you, my beloved. It was for El Diablo. To stop him killing you in your sleep. I seem to recall taking a pitcher of wine at his door. Poor soul... That was the poison! Still, it didn't taste too bad... Hey, Mr Philippe! We're launching the attack. All right, Beno?t is ready. That kurrajong had better work or we'll look like fools. Sound the alarm. Shit! What shall we do? There's an army of them. Listen, everyone. Quiet! Where's the enemy? Show yourselves! We should have left while we could. This is madness indeed. We're doomed. Relax, it's not over yet. Isn't it? It's not over yet. Listen. Quiet, everyone! They're spirits. Can you see them? I see nothing. Must be ghosts! The devil take me. What's going on, El Diablo? Who would dare attack us? Spirits. Listen, Captain. Evil spirits all over the ship... Spirits of those we've killed have come for revenge. Balderdash! Cowards! What are you, men or children, to be scared by mere noises? Milksops. Pusillanimous poltroons. What is that hideous racket? Philippe, at last! Father, what will you do? Vent my rage, daughter. I might even topple a few heads. Mind that yours isn't in my way. Captain! I must accept it, you have the upper hand. Spare us and the pardon is yours. By God! I can now retire in peace. But before, I can't resist seeing your heads roll off. Monbars... Monbars... No. Leave me alone. Go away. The pardon is mine. You can't harm me. No! Here you are at last, Monbars. Come along now. Come with us... You belong with us, Captain Monbars... What exactly happened? My uncle always warned me never to open the golden case as its contents were his alone. And should an evil man try, there's be no pardon for him. Now I see what he meant. Let's go. El Diablo, should we let them get away? Why worry about the children? Monbars has taken off, leaving me the ship and the treasure. In fact, I should thank them. Anyway, assemble the crew. Let's sail out of here. Aye, Aye... Captain! All right, Philippe... this is yours. Thank you. Farewell. Friend, if you're serious about writing would you recount the Beauch?nes' many adventures so that our illustrious name lives on forever? - It would be an honour, sir. Now remember that out of respect for your talent I accept it if your eagerness leads you to exaggerate and embellish my adventures. That's the price one pays to ensure an artist's freedom. Therefore... Don't try to rein in your imagination. Be the artist as much as necessary. - All right. My friend, this will cover your expenses. We're back! It was over. We were home at last. The door through time and space behind Walker's window was closing forever. Because of it, no clock here had gone forward in 250 years. So much time to catch up with! It broke them all. Alas, I am too late. What ill fortune after so much effort. You certainly took your time, you laggard. That's some story. Yeah... Some story indeed. It even explains why our clocks suddenly went haywire. It's beautiful... But it's impossible. You have a great imagination, my boy. I'm patient as a mummy. Sooner or later, you'll spit it out. Inspector, the younger brother's back. He says he's here to bail everyone out. Great, more trouble. Did he break his piggy bank? Let him show you himself. Laurent?
