OK, focus. Tummy out, good. Breathe with... No, you're... Not with the throat. Straight. NOBODY KNOWS I'M HERE Memo? Memo? Someday Memo, you'll get caught sneaking into those houses. You didn't leave a mess at least, right? Imagine the homeowner's reaction. He comes in... ...and runs into a guy like you. I'm... ...a gazelle. Well little gazelle, take that motivation and use it to pay a visit to town. It would do you a lot of good. I don't think they've seen a gazelle like you over there. A storm is coming. Wait here. OK, come in. -3-3. -4-3. Good morning. How are you? That's what a rocket is, a small thing with a big tank. So we haven't yet developed something that allows us to leave, to rise up. And after that... They say that now they're inventing these big sails, solar sails. They suddenly... Have you seen those bugs that suddenly fan out their necks? I think they were inspired by them. That's Sergio, isn't? -How are you, Memo? -Fine. Fine? Look what I brought you. Hold that box, that's it. -What's that? -Here you go. What do you think? -What's that thing? -Good batch, huh? But these are like the last sheep of the planet. After this, sheep went extinct. -They're awfully small. -Small? No, these are quite big beasts. OK, let's keep moving. -Did you watch the game? -I did. 82-77 sir. -Who? Valdivia? -Are you kidding me? Llanquihue! Clear as water. Why do you order this nonsense, Memo? What's the point of reading that rubbish? The guy's fine. He's making money, living his life. Living his life the way he wants to... ...writing that rubbish. You need to focus and let it go, forget about it. Check out how late this old man is coming. Sergio's coming. Alright, don't make a big deal, she already saw you. Mr. Braulio, can you come and help me so I don't run aground? There you go, thank you. -How are you doing? -Fine. No that's OK. I'm Marta, Sergio's niece. -What happened to Sergio? -He got sick. He should have let us know. Yeah well, he had no way of telling you earlier and I just came to bring you these things only. Hi. Weren't you living here alone? Kind of... A hermit, as they named you in Llanquihue. -Is that what they're calling me? -It is. No it's fine, don't worry. -Who is he? -That's Memo. I haven't seen him in Llanquihue before. If you had, you'd remember. Are you staying here? I have to get going. Besides, it seems like there's going to be a storm. Can you tell by the wind? No, just the App. What? Do you have a crush on that skinny girl? No? I think you do... "I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the seven lampstands one like The Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girded about the chest with a golden band, his head and hair were white, like wool, as white as snow" Crystal clear, it's portraying an astronaut. The look of an astronaut from the first moon landing missions. I'm inviting you to something simple, a basketball game. You have too much on your mind Memo, that's the thing. Life goes by like this... Goddammit. Actually... -...I don't even know why I'm asking you. -Then what? I was asking you for a little politeness, to hear your opinion for a change, so you'll talk a bit. To see if maybe one day you'll say, "thank you, uncle". "Thanks for inviting me, I think we'll have a good time" "We'll have fun" Yeah, you just laugh, just keep laughing. You should listen to me, think about it. Instead of sneaking into other people's houses. Memo! -Careful! Watch his head! -Watch your head, it's going to get hit. Careful with the finger. What happened, Mr. Braulio? -Careful! -Hold him tight. Where's the guy with the truck?! Mr Hernan! We need the truck! Why do you put it that way? Tell him he has a marvellous voice Amazing! -But a voice isn't everything. -My son is not stupid. It's cruel! This is a product. The product is the look. Look, the money it's not in the music, it's in the little girls having their first sexual fantasies... ...about your son. Then why have we been recording here for weeks? Because I like his voice. Do you understand me? Yes, but the voice comes with the body, man. Do you want me to... ...you want me to make him lose weight? Is that it? No one here is asking Memo to lose weight. Then what? I don't understand. Then, this is just a proposal. It's quite common, nothing weird about it. What? I don't understand. You... ...give me your son's voice and I'll do the rest. Just his voice? Just his voice, brother. Relax, I'll take care of finding it a body. Friends, tonight, here on this show, "A Star is Born" A new singer, a marvellous voice. Angelo Casas! Memo? Memo! Hey! I brought your uncle's things! Hello! Memo! Memo, open up! I already saw you! Don't you want to know how your uncle is? Alright, it's fine. Hey... Well if you don't want to open the door, at least say something. Alright fine, I'm leaving then. No. Open it then. They sewed his fingers on. -When is he coming back? -I don't know. Soon... ...I think. That color... ...looks nice on you. Well. I have to go now, but tomorrow I can come help if you want. -That's not necessary. -I know but it's no big deal. -I can bring you some food, too. -I have some. I'll come help you anyway, it's not a big deal at all. Either way... ...whatever you need, give me a call. Here's my phone number, you can send me a message too. Hey... You look good. Bye. YOUR NEW FASHION -Hello. -Hello. Thanks. Thanks. Come in. Thank you. Excuse me. Gross. Hey, don't you get tired of the smell of blood? I've seen them since I was little in my uncle's workshop, but... ...it still grosses me out. Do you not talk because you don't want to, or because you have a problem? -What kind of problem? -I don't know... Autism? I don't talk because I don't want to. You're not from here, right? From Chile, I mean. -Why? -For your accent. I lived in Miami. When you were little? Do you need me to help you with anything? I almost forgot. I brought you this. Memo! I brought bread. Can I come in? I'm going to a music festival in Llanquihue. Some really good musicians are going to play a friend who works at the radio, Samuel... ...can get us free tickets. Would you like to go? Angelo Casas... Hey. You've never though about dedicating yourself to that? To sing. I mean... singing! Yes. But it didn't work out. Are you sure you don't want to go to Llanquihue with me? Completely sure? Let's go to Llanquihue. Look... the bands aren't that great, but it doesn't matter, that's not the most important thing. We can just have a good time, we can... ...drink a beer, we can take a walk, we can... I don't know about chat, but we can take a stroll. I can show you the clothes I have at home. You have no reason to stay here alone. Or at least, not to stay here alone forever. -Now what do I do? -Nothing, you turn it off. There, into the square. -How about to watch it? -To watch it? Play. -Play. -Yes. -To play it? -Hold on. Let's see. Uh, there... That's it, do you see? Wait. No, people make up stories. I'm sorry. I know they're talking nonsense, people don't know about the radio. Yeah but you have to relax. At the end, what's the most important thing? Besides, I love how you look with your headphones. You like that? Yeah, today I put my heart into it. The program was good, don't you think? -I took your picture. -Really? Show me. Let's get a good look at it... Look... We're not even dating yet and you're taking photos of me. Ugh, you don't have to be dating to take photos of someone. Yeah but, so many? -I found such a lovely outfit yesterday. -Yeah? C'mon Samuel, don't be so nosy. Give me it. C'mon! That's not why I gave it to you! Isn't that song... Isn't that Angelo's song? Angelo who? That little kid... The little blond-haired, blue-eyed singer. Now you'll see, wait. -Give me it. No, stop, Samuel! It's mine! -Wait, wait. -You won't believe it, look. -Give me that, I'm serious. I want to get closer to the illusion Of being able to love you and give you pure love I want to be the song in your heart Hey, hey! Memo! What the fuck did you do? Help! Get an ambulance! What is that Samuel? Where did you find that? Your little friend is a psychopath. Do you realize Martita? We're going to be famous thanks to him. Oh my god, I can't believe it. "Hi, Uncle" Hi, Memo. "How did it go, Uncle?" Fine, Memo. Does it hurt? More or less. Less every day. Everything OK? Yes. Good, I'm glad. Excuse me. -How are you, Mr. Braulio? -Where did you come from? It's just... You kept your nephew quite a secret, huh? With that mess the other day we weren't introduced at all. How are you? My name is Samuel Legaro, I'm a journalist... -Self-taught, from around here. -Alright, enough. I feel like you're not understanding me, Mr. Braulio... I'm not here to mess around. Really. I want to help your nephew. As a community, we should help you, you should go to the radio. Tell your story, tell your truth. It's quite liberating. Because... you could even make it onto TV. I... You know, if you decide you want to go on the radio... ...let Martita know. Is there something I'm missing here, Memo? Are you fucking kidding me? Get out of here. Leave! Get out! You have nothing to do here! What happened, Memo? -What was all that about? -How should I know! This is a shit house. Don't you ever clean up the house? What happened to your arm? An accident. Not important. Hello. Why did you come here? Are you serious? Are you two living in the Stone Age here? Don't you have YouTube? The internet? Alright, Memo just asked you a question. Did something happen? Are you playing dumb? "Did something happen?" Yes, something happened. It can't be. It can't be. -I think it came out pretty good. -Don't bullshit me. People forget everything in this country. No, no. It's not the 80s, man! The internet is forever. You hear me? Forever! A million views! Do you hear? A million views and counting! I can't get pulled into this shit. -Oh, no? Why? -Because I can't, man! Don't you get it, man? It's going to fuck me up! The damage is done, Jacinto. Man! I have public responsibilities, for fuck's sake! I'm a public figure! Not like I was before! Look at me. I'm no fool, Memo. I know... ...that I've been a really shitty dad. I know I left you on your own here. I abandoned you. Besides... I want to ask you something, son. Understand me. Understand where I'm coming from. Now I'll have to show my stupid face again... -...to defend you. -Alright, then leave! I would love to, I'd go right now... But I'm here with you. By your side. You should be more grateful. Yeah man, more grateful. You want me to show you what people think of your little video? I'm sorry, I... I didn't know it would cause such a mess. Come in. We're still 4 to 3. 3-3 -Almost 5 to 3. -No. -Almost. -At least I'm winning. C'mon Memo, make an effort. The world turns... I spoke with Angelo. He wants to talk to you. -What, now? -No. We're going to solve everything son, everything. Just as great as you solved it last time? Can I ask you a favor, man? Shut up, OK? This isn't reality... The world is outside. This is a fantasy, Memo. Go to the tv show, Memo. It'll give you peace. Leave this place! Let's see. What's with the faces? It's good news, for fuck's sake. Look Memo, I already told the people at the program yes. There's no turning back! -I'm not going. -What do you mean you're not? Hold on a minute. What are you going to do, stay here and live with this old grump? Is that it? Hey, bastard! I lost everything because of you! Everything! Don't you remember? The fucking lawyers, the doctors! I lost everything! I lost your mother! Memo... Relax man, easy... It's been quite difficult to reach... ...my ex wife. You have an incredible talent. You have a marvellous voice, Memo. I'm sure you would beat all those people... ...who go on TV singing contests. That's why you have to go on that program. You're a big man. A giant soul, Memo. A good man. A true man. Never forget that. I'll pick you up early tomorrow, OK? Make sure you're ready. Any questions, concerns, anything? I'll call to the front desk so they can notify you to your room Anything to ask? No? Alright. Try and rest now that you'll be... ...calm, alone, in this place that's so nice. Show your face, coward! Come outside, bastard! Where you live is nice. Well, the south in general is... ...so gorgeous, it has so much vegetation. Summer must be terrible, huh? It must get overrun with people. Wow. You look very good. Shall we? Now that restaurant I told you about, the market is amazing. -Did you meet the owner? -Yes. We'll talk later... Memo. Well, the idea was for you to see each other beforehand to chat a bit... relax. Now guys, this is also for things to be pleasant between you, right? Honey, why don't we leave them alone for a bit. Go touch up... ...NicolÃ¡s meanwhile, OK? Guys, this program was made for you two to... ...express what you want to say. If there are emotions, so be it, if you want to hug, hug. OK? Then, there are also musicians prepared, -if you want to sing. -No, thanks but I won't be singing. I appreciate it from the soul. I already told your boss no. Yes, I understand. The point is that... People will want to see a moment like that. Thank you very much, but really, it has to do with my... It's nothing personal, you can play a clip if you want, but no singing. OK. Well... The idea is for you to feel comfortable, really. The program invitiation is fundamentally for you both to be comfortable. I'll give you time to chat, without pressure. I'll be on set. We still have 5 minutes. Memo? Sit down, rest assured. How are you, Memo? You look good. You're fine. And you still sing very well too. I don't know if your father told you how we're going to do this... My life was destroyed, Memo. But it's not your fault. So, more than forgiving you I'm going to ask for your forgiveness, up there, OK? I don't know if you know what I'm doing with my life. You're still not talking. Some things never change, huh? Well, my work is to motivate people. I set an example for life. And this is a very big opportunity for my work, to take it further. And there's no conflict. We do what we have to do up there, it does you good, it does me good. End of story. You mean... ...we're going to talk about how your life was destroyed, but not about how mine was destroyed? My life was destroyed! Is that clear? My life was destroyed! The only thing I'm asking is for you to be the victim up there. I can't move, you can move. Not much... ...but you can move. I can't. We both get paid. Everyone's happy, period. -Alright? -Everything alright? -Quite alright. -Ah! Fantastic! Shall we? We're about to go on. Of course. No, I'll come get you after, Memo. First we'll start with Angelo, remember... And then you're next. Everyone ready on set? On air in five, four, three... Good evening. Welcome to our show Face to Face. Our first guest, Angelo Casas. An applause for him. He's a man of many travels and a lot of wisdom. Tell us yourself, Angelo. How are things? -Thank you, Nico. A pleasure to be back. -Likewise, my friend. A big kiss and peace to everyone who's watching. Good Nico, presenting the book, traveling around the world. -This planet, our home, the Pachamama. -That's it, how's the book tour? Very well. It's had the best reception by people around the world. People are really in need of a spiritual movement, so I, with my energy, what I do is provide hope. And the world is receiving it in the best way. Ladies and gentleman, a man who is an example of resilience. -Dear Angelo? -Yes. Well... I'd like for us to watch a quick video that's going around social media. How about we watch it and then we debate it a bit? -Go ahead. -Let's go. The case of former child singer, Angelo Casas, takes a new turn. After his attacker, Memo Garrido, appeared in a video singing one of the former singer's songs. The story seemed over, but after 25 years... ...we open a new chapter in the novel. That only gets darker and more sinister. Memo? Shall we? It's your turn. Come, this way. -I want to thank you again... -Everything is gonna be fine. That in a show of humility you've agreed to appear today on our program, alongside... ...the person who left you... ...wheelchair bound. -Wait a second. -Alongside your attacker. Ladies and gentlemen, Memo Garrido. Memo... ...wouldn't you like to ask Angelo for forgiveness? NicolÃ¡s, I appreciate the gesture but Memo really doesn't have to apologize to me I've already forgiven him in my soul, in my heart. The one who has to apologize, and I'm going to do it publicly, it's me. Memo... ...I apologize in front of so many people. I'm sorry, I was a child. I didn't know what I was doing. I made fun... ...of you. And may this serve as an example for everyone who's watching. Bullying is a two-way street. Assailant and assaultee, are both victims. -We both... -It was my voice. Memo. We're talking about reconciliation, asking forgiveness, about closing, about opening up and birthing a new life. -I apologized and I'll say it again. -Tell them the truth! You didn't sing. It was my voice. Memo? Powerful accusations. Live TV, you know how it is. After a brief commercial break, we'll be back on Face to Face. Please, calm down, Memo! Are we off right? What happened? -What's going on? -What do you mean? We're off the air now. Make up and wardrobe! Get out, you were awful. Tell me one thing. Do you sing? Answer to me! Do you sing?
