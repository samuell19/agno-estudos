This film is based on a true story. It was on October 8, 1895, during the dispute between Japan, Russia and Qing Dynasty over taking control of Joseon, when Japan assassinated Empress Myeongseong. When the pro-Japanese Cabinet later seized power and issued the Short Hair Act Order, the citizens of Joseon erupted with anger. 5 months after Empress Myeongseong's assassination March 9th, 1896 Chihapo Anak-gun, Hwanghae Province Die! Son of a bitch! You bastard! I, Kim Chang-soo, from Teotgol, Baek-un-bang, Haeju, Hwanghae Province, have killed this man. Kim Chang-soo MAN OF WILL 5 months later August 13th, 1896 Look! Isn't he Kim Chang-soo? It is him. Looks like he came from Haeju just now. I think so, too. Seems like he's been through a lot. Out of the way. It's good that he killed him. Get to work! What are you looking at? Get to work! You bastards! Get back to work! Keep working! Walk while facing ahead. Where the heck are you looking at? - You! - Stupid! Work! You bastards! Get to work! Keep working! Hurry. Get to work! Keep going! Now, pants off and bend over. It's okay. Everyone does it. We're checking to see if you're sick or hiding anything. Just relax. Pull your pants down! - Do it! - Pants off, now! Ow, my back! What the hell? I'm... different from these men. Why you... How? Think you're different? I'm not a criminal! I haven't been convicted yet. Are you out of your mind? Bastard! Let go! Stop fooling around! Get up! Get up now! What... the hell is going on here? Come on. You men are... humans, aren't you? Forgive me, sir! You're bleeding! - So do your job right! - Yes, sir. It's because you treat them like humans that our prison and country are in such a messed up state. The warden is speaking! Quiet, fool! Think that'll do? Are you okay? But I was speaking. You hear me? I was speaking! Go on. Get rid of him. - Come in! - Hurry! - Get up! - Take him away quickly. Kim Chang-soo murdered a Japanese man. No food for 3 days. Yes, sir! You're all dead! Jerk! Welcome. This is Warden Kang Hyeong-sik. No need to worry. I'll keep a close watch on him. Of course. He's not just some heinous felon. He killed a foreigner. A Japanese at that! He's just an ignorant fool. Here at Incheon, he'll be tried under international law. He'll receive due punishment for murder. Of course, he should. If there is justice in Joseon, that is. Well... Let's drink. Snap to it! Get up! Walk, fool! Stand up! Welcome to hell. Sit down, jerks! Damn it! Why throw a corpse in here? He must be the fool who made us starve for 3 days! Deok-pal? Come help him up. Why help this bloody chap? Who cares if he dies or not? - Cheon-dong? - Yes, I'll help. Damn it. What if we end up having to bury him? Shut up! Or I'll rip your mouth off! One, two, three, four, five. - One! - Two! Three! Four! Are you okay? Until the trial... he says he won't eat. He's being stubborn, sir. Let him be. - Pardon? - Just make sure he's alive. Oh... How's the face? It's fine, sir. Not you. That fool, Kim Chang-soo. Don't touch his face. Out of our way! Give me that. Damn it! Go chuck it out before I shove it down your throat. The newbie cleans the dung. That's the rule. Leave him. He's not well. No one is well in this hell! Look, bastard. Think you can just keep sitting there pretty? I don't care what you did before coming here! - You son of a bitch! - Shut up! Kim Chang-soo! Come out. Go to trial. September 10th, 1896 Incheon Court All rise! Be seated. The final trial of... the murder which took place... on March 9th, 1896 at Chihapo, Hwanghae Province... will now go into session. The defendant killed Kato Hideki, a Japanese man. He was arrested on May 11th and investigated at Hwanghae Prison. As it is a serious case of murdering a foreigner, at the request of the Japanese Consulate... he was transferred here to Incheon on August 13th. State your name, birthdate, and address. Kim Chang-soo. I was born on August 29th, 1876. I'm from Teotgol, Baek-un-bang, Haeju, Hwanghae Province. Do you admit to the crime of murdering Kato Hideki? I killed him. However... I didn't commit a crime. Silence! Damn jerk. How is killing someone not a crime? I got revenge for our empress that night! Do you have proof that he killed Her Majesty? The Japanese I killed... He was in disguise and carrying a sword. When I asked if he killed the empress... he tried to kill me when I was unarmed! If he wasn't the assassin, why would he attack me? Here are Kato's identification papers. The Consulate confirms... Kato was a merchant from Tsushima Island. A merchant can't be that skilled in swordsmanship! With recent assaults on Japanese people in Joseon, our merchants are traveling in disguise. He killed an innocent Japanese who was grasped by fear. If he is not punished justly... in the honor of Great Imperial Japan, I will not... stand for it. You savages stabbed our empress dozens of times! Then! You burned her body and threw it down a well! You're not humans! All I did... was kill a beast that night! How dare you! This is a court of Joseon! Suppose what you said is true. Who gave you the right to kill him? Then... should I have just turned a blind eye? If you had turned him in to us, Joseon's laws would've seen to him! Your foolish actions... rather caused problems for Joseon! Look at yourselves! The real culprits are in front of your eyes, yet you can't speak out a word and are brazen enough to wear mourning clothes. Our empress has died, but there is no killer! This... is Joseon's reality! You've committed a serious crime of murder. You have thrown this country into chaos by killing a foreigner. Therefore, you must be strictly punished! I only did what a man of Joseon should do. The court sentences Kim Chang-soo... Joseon's maximum punishment, the death penalty. Those Japs are the ones who should be put to death! They so easily killed our empress! Those savages will kill countless Joseon people! Don't you get it? You despicable Japs! When I die, I'll become a ghost... to kill your king and all your people! You'll pay for this! Mark my words! Even in death... I'll get revenge! You hear me? The Independent When will he be executed? It won't be long, but as executions are uncommon, His Majesty must sign for it first. Where's the point in that when the country's falling apart anyway? Contrary to your looks, you're picky with food. Back in the day, I only used to eat white rice and meat. Did you make a lot of money by selling girls? How many times did I tell you, you geezer? I took pity in the poor girl so I took her back to her hometown. Really? - Yeah, right. - I'm serious! Eat quickly and get going. Out of the way, you fool. Eat up. Think you're too good for this? What? Think we're all bums because we eat this shit, huh? Let go! Get back, you bastards! Damn it! That guy's been trouble since day one! I'll teach him a lesson! He could punch you to death. What the hell? He got the death penalty. You didn't know that? You should know that much. You're in the same room. He killed Her Majesty's killer with his bare hands. He killed them all. Jeez. About 40 of 'em. - Put it behind your neck. - Jeez, I know that. It's all about flexing and breathing properly. On three. One, two, three! Ow! My back! Stupid fool! Hold it. One, two, three! Let's go. Mr. Strong, huh? You just spoke for the first time. Lighten up. It's not so bad here. There's food and a place to sleep. How old are you? Sixteen. Why are you here? Well, I didn't eat for several days and couldn't take it anymore. I tried to make a run after eating a bowl of soup, but got caught. I got scared and pushed the owner. But he fell and cracked his head. Your parents? Mom died early and I don't know about Dad. You jerk! People die here for missing a meal. What you say can kill people. So stop acting up and stay low. Useless bastards. What? Think our lives are pathetic? Watch it or I'll kill you first. I don't want to live. Let's die together, jerk! Let go! Why? Wanna live? You wanna live? Then try to break free! How's that? You don't even know what dying means! Back to work! Bastard! Go back to work! Stop staring and get going! Move it! The hell? Son of a bitch! Got a death wish? Good thing you came! This jerk hit him first! Let go! A man on death-row can't die here. Get up, idiot! Don't get comfortable! Is it cozy? Get up! Excellent! You've improved a lot, warden. I'm too addicted to this. Everything looks like balls to me. It's like that at first. Gradually, you improve. Japan is planning something important for Joseon. And what is that? Well... We're negotiating with the Yankees about building a railway in Joseon. If all goes well, Japan will own the rights to build and manage it. So you wanted to see me because... It's hard to round up workers for the construction. I see. They're mine! Get him down first. Take down his pants. His pants are mine. Get him down. No one paid him any attention. But they go crazy after he's dead? Lad. Rest in peace. Thanks! Good thinking! What good is living here for long? Give me those. No way, pal! You wanna die? No! They're mine now! How dare you! Stop it! Respect the dead! Well... hello, Mr. Ko. Getting mixed feelings because you're on death-row? You're right. It's because I'll be dead soon too! Damn son of a bitch. Clean up quickly. He ruined the morning! Cheon-dong? Leave him. Let him dream. If he wakes up, he's back in hell. Still awake this late? How can you read after what you've just done? Know how many people die because they can't read? So you threw away the corpse? How much do you get paid? You're no different from that corpse. You're just waiting to die in this damn gutter! Do you know when people are most miserable? It's when they feel living is no better than dying. There are piles of people who died like that in this country. At least I can be of use before I die. What a pretty flower. What did this wild flower do so wrong to bloom in prison? People here are no different from this flower. Flowers bloom freely. But they're here because they committed crimes. What about you? What about him? Most of them didn't receive trials. They're stuck, not knowing if they'll live or die. As for that lad, I heard he was framed. Flowers blooming in or outside prison... are all the same. How can you eat? - Bitch! - Son of a bitch! This piece of shit. I'll help you stand trial! Let him go. Go away, boys. Eat up. I was a collector. For noble landlords. One day, I went to collect overdue debt. But the damn landlord was on the farmer's girl. I may have lived like a dog, but I can't stand things like that. So I went in to pull him off of her. But... That damn old geezer... He ended up killing her. She was just 14. But her damn father... said that I killed her in return for canceling his debts. That's how I ended up in here. Aren't you going to clear your name? I have no money or schooling. Who would listen to a fool like me? I'm not saying I'm an angel. But still... I didn't kill anyone. Like you did. I'm different. Everyone here says he's different. That they've all been wronged. It's exactly why they're stuck in this hell. I'll get you out. Why don't you get yourself out? For me... It's already over. I would've run away, if I were you. Might as well die while trying to escape. Why would I escape? If I ran, it'd be the same as admitting that I did something wrong! I'm not doing that! Whatever, fool! Rot in prison then. What are you writing? You're writing shit about me, aren't you? Want to learn? Don't think I can? Keep writing! It was March, right? Yes, March. Refreshing, huh? You're scrubbing his skin off! The last time you washed was last year during the rainy season! - By the way... - Yeah? Isn't it weird? - What is? - What is? Look. The fistfight has brought them close together. What if they get hitched? Those damn two criminals in love? The hell? Mi-eum. What's this? A petition, sir. A petition? Send it to the court, please. This is ludicrous. How did you write this? You can't write! Yes, I can. See? I wrote this myself! Who wrote this? Chang-soo. Who? Kim Chang-soo in Room 9. This will save me. Chang-soo worked hard to write that. So please send it for me. At this rate, the Japanese will take over all of Joseon. How can they argue over our land? My mom was really sick two years ago. So I borrowed money from a Japanese with my land as collateral. But that damn son of a bitch! He sold my land, then ran off to Japan. Damn bastard! Those damn Japs are all the same! Hey! Watch your mouth. That land had been passed down for generations. Too bad. That land will be worth its weight in gold soon. You see, I have my sources. Let me take care of it. If I do get it back for you... you owe me. What are you talking about? I know a guy who is amazing at writing petitions. Who's the fool? I mean, who is that person? You'll see. Wow! Where'd you get this precious fruit? Today's your 60th birthday. Right! Think of it as a present. Cheon-dong's all grown up. - Remember my birthday too. - Yes, sir! Thank you very much! He's the only one who remembered my big day! Is it really your 60th birthday? You're not lying? You inconsiderate fool! Think I have nothing better to do than lie about my birthday? Why raise your voice at breakfast? Forget it! - Have it. - No way! - Come on. - Forget it! - Pretty please? - Why you! What are you all happy about? Huh? I'll do it. I don't believe this. In all my 20 years as a guard, I never thought I'd do this. Is he really good? Come on. He's good. Don't trust me? I trust you. But how can I trust this fool? But on one condition. - Why you... - What? It looks so good! - Cheon-dong! - Yes? Escort him to his birthday feast. Me? Oh my! It's for my 60th birthday! Mr. Ko! Come on! I can't believe this! I'm so happy! Come here! Oh my! Look at all this yummy chicken! Thank you! Wait! Your 60th birthday calls for a big celebration. You should invite people to eat and celebrate. Right, folks? Of course! He's right! You have a good point. Usually, the sons prepare their parent's 60th birthday feast. Can I call you "son" today? Sure. Great! Everyone, clap for my son! Listen up. Since it's my birthday, those I call out will be invited to eat with me. Me! Me! Cho Deok-pal! I knew it! Everyone else but him! Come on over! I knew he was special the moment I saw him. His entrance itself was like no other! His face was covered in blood and all. - You're really something. - I'm flattered. Excuse me. Can you help me too? I'm able to leave thanks to you. Take care. - Best of luck to you too. - Thank you. Take care! - You must be so happy! - I am. I wrote down everything. Thank you. I'm so tired. Line up! Persimmons. You're a bright lad. Get back! What are you staring at? Why you little... Thanks, man. Why are there two lines! Too many people here are unjustly imprisoned. Ignorance is not bliss. How did you end up in here? What good is bringing up my past? I'm paying for all those who died unjustly because of me. What do you mean? Actually, I knew you long before. Me? Word spread among us about a young leader of Haeju's militia. How could I not know you? Then you too? We had high hopes for you. But you were defeated too. I guess we were fated to meet here. I'm ashamed. We are more ashamed. Because we didn't prepare well, so many people were killed. How can we ever be forgiven? It's our fault. We let the world end up like this. Soon, that snowfield will be turned into a railway. I guess Joseon will be modernized soon. Have you looked for the workers I mentioned before? For sure, I'll find them. It's all for Joseon's good. Stupid! Look here. These are the best shoes I have. I didn't know who you were then. I'm sorry I kicked you before. How can we help you? I decide the order. There are dozens on the waiting list. Hurry! Let's go! Let's talk again later. Thank you very much, sir! Guess. Why am I here? Don't you get it? One of you will die today. Who will it be? You? You? You! Are you scared? Look at you! You! No, you! Bring him out. Mr. Ko! - Mr. Ko! - No! No... It's okay. Mr. Ko... I'm okay. Will you remember me? How could I forget? Thanks. As long as someone remembers me, death is not the end of me. I hope... you'll forever live in the hearts of people too. Okay... 157 413, 325, 296, 543 Farewell, sir... Hey! Get over it. Those on death-row die after all. Watch that damn tongue! Death-row? Stupid! How could you! Well there was no offense! 413! 413, Kim Chang-soo! Yes, sir! Let's go. Chief? I brought him. Mr. Kim! Welcome! You can go. Yes, sir. Sir. I wanted to thank you. I got my land back thanks to you. I'm sorry I doubted you. Have a seat. I'm glad, sir. Would you like to smoke? This is hard to get. Hero cigarettes! Well... About this land deed... It's too old, that you can hardly read the letters. With the Japanese and all... I'm worried something could go wrong. So I'm thinking of having it re-written and registered. Can you do that for me? I'll give you a bigger feast this time. But a meal is just a meal. Then what? Study? Here? That's just crazy! How could... Look, Chang-soo. After a few petitions, aren't you going a bit too far? Please hear me out. We all ate well on his birthday. Food doesn't last. But learning to read and write lasts a lifetime. If anything goes wrong, they'll only hold me responsible. So if anyone wants to learn... You'll take responsibility? How? You could be dead tomo... Here in prison... all you need to do is eat, sleep, and work. That's all you need. What good will learning a few letters do for us? Come on. It's damn cold. Let's go! Damn stupid jerks! Move! Watch carefully. I-eung. A circle. Lower. A bit lower. Good. Ma Sang-gu! This is my name. If anyone of you can write your name, come up here. Come up! No one? Chang-soo's offering to make you into a more decent human being. He didn't ask you for food or money! Rather than being stupid all your life, why don't you just go and die now! That's enough. Excuse me? What! If I study, I can stop being a thief, right? I won't have to be imprisoned again? Then I'd like to learn it. Please teach me a few words. Silly fool! Why just a few? I'll teach them all! Mr. Ko died a few days ago. That's right. I don't know when it'll be my time. Even if I'm gone... You can avoid being victimized if you can read and write. Let's all study together. I hope you'll join me. Family This word is "family." We are a family. It refers to people who eat and live together. Let's eat and study together. And depend on each other. - F-a-m! - F-a-m! - i-l-y! - i-l-y! Family! I depend on you. - Kim Nam-sik. - Kim Nam-sik. Lee Jae-yun. Lee Jae-yun. Today, read and write your names and memorize them before you go to bed. Start with learning the words you want. And in no time, you'll master the alphabet soon. I have four circles in my name! Look! Yang Won-jong! Choi Un-sik It doesn't have the stick-like alphabet. Choi Yun-seok Hello, Mom. It's your son, Ma Sang-gu. Please forgive me for being a terrible son... It's freezing! - Hello. - Hi. There are so many letters! I know! They're all from Incheon Prison. A prison? Indeed! He got smarter! I thought his life was over, but he got smarter in prison! Stop! Let the kids eat! Look at him! He's lost weight! At Incheon Prison, if you can't even write your own name, they all make fun of you. A man on death-row named Kim Chang-soo... He's really, really smart! I'd like to thank you again. Thanks to you, warden, we've been able to start the railway construction. Not at all. It's a way for the freeloading prisoners to turn a new leaf. I'm the one who's thankful. Please take it. Very nice. We've been waiting. How dare he? How will the construction ever be done? Explain that! Go on. Read it. Read it. Read. I did it! They're innocent. I forced them to it! Bastard! Read. Incheon Prison's prisoner, Kim Chang-soo, taught the prisoners how to read and write. Incheon Prison is no longer just a prison. It has become a school for the prisoners. Enough. Kim Chang-soo. Yes. I ask you. Where is this? Incheon Prison, sir. Right. It's a prison! Prison! Prison! It's a damn prison! Sir! It's late. We'll handle this. You're the same as them! Die, bastard! Die! Don't hit him! What wrong did he do? What did he do so wrong? What's wrong with learning to read? Enough. A school? Damn bastard! Everyone! You'll construct a railway that connects Incheon to Hanseong. As Joseon's first railway, it will remain as a great achievement in our history, so do your very best. For this honorable work of modernizing Joseon, you will all take part in it. Anyone who does not follow orders... will be strictly punished. As you requested, sir. Drink up, sir. But not too much. It must be hard. We all have it hard. Nothing's easy. Life is a prison. You can't change anything. Blame the country. Just stay low like the others till you die. Then it's easy. Only those who can will make a difference. I'm not doing it because I can... but because I must. Work faster! 157, what are you doing? Move! Faster! What's wrong? He's hurt badly! Hey! A man is hurt! Hold still. It hurts! You should be getting used to it by now. Bare the pain. Look at all those stars. We'll become stars when we die, right? Take one. Let's eat. You should eat. Your face is half the size it was. You eat it. What happened to your handsome face? What handsome face? Cheon-dong! Cheon-dong! Have another one! Thank you! Jailbreakers! Sit down! Sit! That's Jong-su! Stop! Stop you bastards! Sit down! Freeze! Run. I have to live! I must live! Damn it. Please don't kill me. My mother is very sick. You want to live? Me too. Please... Fools! Do it right! Sir! It could break! What did you say, bastard? You wanna die? Cheon-dong! - Cheon-dong! - Chang-soo! Don't go near. Get the rope! Now! Cheon-dong! - Get the rope! - Cheon-dong. Cheon-dong! Tie it! Tie up quick! - Hold tight! - Be careful. Be careful! - Go down slowly. - Be careful! Hurry! Hold it tightly. Hold tight! Almost there! Wait! Chang-soo! Go over there! Oh my god... Hold him! Chief! Sir! Hold his leg! Stay alert! - Cheon-dong! - Are you okay? - This way! - Cheon-dong! Hurry! It'll collapse again. We gotta go! - Let's go. - Hurry. Wake up! Come out of there! Clear! - Get out of there. - Get out! Get out of there! Help me! Over here! Help! Shit. Take the kid and go! Hurry! I'll be right out! Just go! No! Chang-soo! No! Let the damn guard die! No! Wait! I'm not doing this because I like you! I learned from Chang-soo... that a bastard like you is no different than us. We're okay! Let go! - Chang-soo! - Chang-soo! Sang-gu... No! Sang-gu! No! No! What's all this? Many people died, sir. What? Take them out. They can't go! What? Move back, Cheon-dong. What are you doing! Look. Are you crazy? You could all die. Just go back for now. No, we won't! The corpses are not leaving this place. They can't go! - They can't go! - They can't go! They can't go! You crazy bastards! Bring all the guards! Get 'em out of here! Move! They can't go! You bastards! They can't go! They can't go! They can't go! They can't go! Hold tight! They can't go! Ma Sang-gu They can't go! 8 men died! They didn't deserve to die. They worked as they were told to. Give us permission to hold a funeral for them. And give us good food to eat! We'll talk and even sing while at work! And make it three shifts instead of two! I warned you to just stay low like the others. Please write my conditions down and sign it. If you do so, the railway will be completed by the deadline. Sign it? Damn ungrateful bastards! What? You think I'm doing this for my own good? This country needs it! When Incheon is connected to Hanseong by train, Joseon will prosper! What do you know? We'll lose the land where the tracks will lie to the Japanese. Countless people will die due to harsh labor! Their exploitations will get far worse! Go on. There are those who have the Japanese people's backs and making money off the work we've done by putting our lives on the line. You have no right to take that money! Exactly! Damn smart, aren't you? But what can you do with the money? What good is it to you dumb bastards! I'll expose it all! But if I die before I'm able to do so, someone else will write a complaint. If that person dies, then someone else will do it for him! Son of a bitch! That's why you taught them to read and write? I taught them to fight against what's wrong. There's one more condition. Give us the time and place to study openly! Keep talking. Kim Chang-soo. Kim Chang-soo.

Although he did kill a man, it was to get revenge on the Empress' assassin. We will gladly give up our lives, if only you'll save Kim Chang-soo. Sincerely, the prisoners of Incheon Prison. Your Majesty! Why would you stop an execution based on the words of those good-for-nothing prisoners? It will strain our relationship with Japan. How can you fret over Japan when a civilian's life is at stake? What decisions can we make without considering Japan? That's diplomacy! For whom is this diplomacy you speak of? There is no diplomacy when we can't even protect the lives of our people! Not all civilians should be treated equally. He put the country at risk by acting rash. It's preposterous to keep him alive! He said he killed Her Majesty's assassin! There's no solid evidence that the person he killed was an assassin! Enough! I've heard enough. What you sign is the law, Your Majesty. If you overturn it so easily, they'll think lightly of Joseon. Think lightly of Joseon? Has Japan ever thought highly of Joseon? I've never been treated so. Now, they want the life of one of my dear people. I'll sign the execution again once I have more proof. No, Your Majesty! Chief secretariat! I'll send a telegram to Incheon Prison. You must hurry. You must've been scared. You must've been lonely. As you waited to die in the cold prison... I'm ashamed I couldn't do anything for you. Thank you for getting revenge for my dear empress. It pains me that this is the only thing that I can do for you. Kim Chang-soo. I shall never forget you. Kim Chang-soo... died today, sir. What's left of my life is not mine. I'll leave this place, sir. From now on... I'll devote my life to fighting and stopping unjust deaths in Joseon. I didn't hear that. Ignorant fools! They think he's some hero who'll save this country? A country doesn't collapse for no reason. It's been rotten to the core since long ago. Brainless Joseon bastards! How dare they... Shut the hell up! Damn it. I have something to say. I can't believe you're back alive. This feels like a dream. I miss Mr. Ko and Ma Sang-gu all the more today. They would've been so happy. It's great. But he's still stuck here till no telling when. They could still execute him. I'm leaving here tonight. We could die while trying. If we fail, we'll die. You must decide carefully. I just want to see the outside world once before I die. I want to make lots of money and feed hungry kids for free. Then we can open a black bean noodles shop! Hurry up. Hurry. Won-sik! Come and sit here. What's with all the booze? Drink up. Cheers! Hurry. Hurry up! Faster! Got it! Let's go. Come on. It's okay. Just look down. Did you hear that? Yes. That stinks. You go. Is something there? No... No, sir. Must've been a rat. Scared? Find them now! Search the backyard! Move! Move! I'm sorry, sir! Damn it! Bank of Joseon Account Book You stupid bastards! You idiots! What were you all doing! Get going! Go catch them now! Get out jerks! Stupid bastards! What is it? It's nothing, sir. I'll find the jailbreakers... I'm in charge from now on! And! Yes. It's a lot of money. We'll use it for greater things, not for the prisoners! You should be ashamed! Take him away! Sir. Let go. Let go. - Don't touch me! - Stop! Why? Why should I be ashamed? Everything's ruined in this country. At least I don't talk big and hide behind a weak emperor! You're just a greedy beast in this human world! Take him away! Try all you want! Joseon will soon disappear and nobody will remember it! Everything will be erased and gone! Kim Chang-soo vanished without a trace... On March 19th, 1898, Kim Chang-soo escaped Incheon Prison. 12 years later, Japan annexed Joseon by force. Kim Chang-soo devoted his life to fighting for independence. Countless young men joined him in the independence movement. Kim Chang-soo, who was a death-row convict, was none other than Kim Gu, also known as Baekbeom, who was the Premier of the Provisional Government of Korea.
