From now on, I'm your girlfriend. You and I are a match now. Right, Although it's not an exact match because our faces look different, We're a match. However, only for a hundred days. Dae Woong. Since we're a match... There's something I really wanted to do. Will you let me do it? We're a match anyway What's there not to do? What is it you want to do? Why did you bring a towel? You also put something on your face. Please accept this. Stop. I think I know what you're doing... This won't do I really wanted to do this. - Let me continue. - No. I became your boyfriend because of the bead. Are you trying to make me your husband? Gumiho, you have no decency. Heck, your lack of it is overwhelming. I was planning to do this. How disappointing. Woong! Then let's mate! What ? I think I heard you wrong. Let's do what? Mating. You like it that much? Rather than mating with Gu Mi Ho, I'd rather throw up the bead. You think it will come out that way? Now, you definitely won't be able to take it out for 100 days. For the time being, you're mine Okay good. Let's do it. Is this... what you want? No I was just playing around. Don't play around thoughtlessly. I'm sorry. For a normal woman, this is normal. Okay good. Let's do it. Is this...what you want? Mi Ho ah, don't do this. I was just playing around. What do you mean? I said I was playing around. I'm sorry. Let go. Let...go. Did I do something stupid? No. Let's just think about the bead inside my stomach. If I just hold it in for a hundred days, then it'll end. A person playing around with a Gumiho. I got excited for no reason. In 100 days, I'll become a person. From now, it's a hundred days. After a hundred days, one end will be empty. And the other end will be completely... full. Instead of dating, we've started a contract. I need the bead. And you want to stay here. Even though we're together out of need, the line the human beings and Gumiho cannot pass... Let's both keep that in mind. Alright. Whatever you don't like, I won't do it. Then... Looking at me like you want to eat me. Don't look at me like that. Does it look like I want to eat you? That's weird. I don't think like that these days. These days? Ah, I'm really tired. You can't just sleep like this. Why? I'm tired. I need to make a few thing clear. I have to know. You... wanted to eat me before haven't you? Why are you asking me something like that? Even once. "Woow, Dae Woong must be really delicious." You've never done that? You're Gumiho. Because of your instincts, You can make mistakes. I don't want to tell you. I'll understand, so tell me. Have you thought like that before or not? Just... One time. Just one time? Actually twice. Twice?! Why~? You said you'd understand. Who would understand something like this? Rather, It would have been better if I didn't hear that. Let's put some distance between us. Woong. Right now, I don't have the courage to look at your face. I shouldn't have told him! Twice? How would I know whether it's not three times or four times? At a place with good udon soup, would you like to have a bowl of udon soup? Together... I should have eaten udon soup. I'm a type of guy that smells like salonpas and has a rough personality. It stings. My eyes and heart. They really really sting. You scared me. What's wrong with you? Are you crying? It won't come off. This isn't coming off. What did you use to draw them? This. You used a permanent marker on your face? I just thought it was a red paint. Let's see. Put your face up. What kind of Gumiho is so stupid? Let's try searching it up How to erase a permanent marker. Yah, there's a lot of results There must be a lot of stupid people Then, so i did something like a human? oh, water-based salonpas... water-based salonpas? whoa, feels nice and cool! Stay still. Oh, its coming off Really ? Yea. sigh, drawing things like these... I wanted to put red makeup on and experience a marriage ceremony. Long time ago... I wanted to get married and live a human life. but there were rumors that a gumiho would eat human liver No one came near me. And so, I couldn't get married and was trapped in the painting so you were a victim of malicious gossip. What's that? making up stuff that will insult and degrade a person. Man, people were just as bad back then... I've never eaten a person before last time I stopped a tiger from eating someone by telling it not to The tiger didn't eat the person, because you told it too? Yea! I told it that if it didn't listen to me, I would eat it so you usually threaten things by telling them you're going to eat them Since it's been over 500 years... ....since the rumor has started I can see that rumors can't be stopped easily... Prejudice don't change easily. When I become a famous actor my friend, director Kim Byung-soo, and I will... get rid of this false "prejudice" about gumihos by making a movie Really? That's right. since your bead is helping me with my acting career it's the least I can do Oh, that's right Present. Hold on You're going to be really surprised Mi Ho. What do you love most in the entire world? meat That's right No matter how you look at it... this present was only made for you Even if you really like it, don't let your tails come out, okay? Ok Especially for the Gumiho I present this mega super king size chicken leg! Chicken leg! Wow, its really big! Here, Mi Ho, accept it! Mi Ho, are you ok? Mi Ho. Why...do you not like it? Are you disappointed because its not real meat? No Because I really like it instead of my tails, but I think my tears are coming out Next time, I will look for cow meat doll. let's try finding it Hey, don't bite it! The cotton will fall out Even so...I need to at least appreciate it by taking a bite If the chicken had this big of a leg it'd be this big! It'd be THIS BIG! If I had such chicken all my worries would disappear the fact that Dae-woong is injured does the director know? Not yet. didn't you say that you were going to persuade Dae-woong to give up? I did... but I haven't heard from him since. I wonder if he took it too hard. of course! That unni is always selfish and a smart aleck so she can be really inconsiderate. Isn't she being too harsh now that things are hard for Dae-woong? Dae-woong probably can't tell the director that he will give up. before he goes gungho and hurts himself I will tell the director. Director! you! who the heck are you! How could you do this? It was perfect Look into my eyes. There's no fear in your eyes. Fear I know not of such a thing aerial triple 360's then, landing on one footweren't you afraid? Not at all. usually, one footed landings end with a broken ankle. I do not fear injury. action while fearing injury I'm not.... That kind of man oooh, you've appeared at last. your action moves has a uh.... I was touched I shall move you even more. Moved Moved Ah, moved Are you okay? are you performing despite alot of pain? Look at my eyes closely Do these look like eyes that are in pain? I told you that it was okay Everything got solved. Ring ... if you would just look at it it looks like a couple ring worn so that all can see. Cha Dae Woong. how can he hook up again without rest? Who is it? Maybe it's Hae-In noona Unni Give me your hand for a second Huh? This doesn't look like a couple ring ... Couple Ring? Unni, this It's not you and Dae Woong's couple ring? No Then... Whose couple ring is Dae Woong carrying around? That What are you talking about? Cha Dae Woong must've gotten himself a new girlfriend Girlfriend? Dae-woong has always been popular with girls plus he's now signed up with a movie Movie? I thought he couldn't do it Dae Woong's body looks fine All of a sudden, he's filming the movie Didn't you know? So it really isn't unni Couple ring? With who?! I'm Dae Woong's girlfriend. He must have really needed the bead. This ring . . . You give it to the person you like Cha Dae Woong doesn't like you and you're not human I'll become a human soon And he could start liking me in the future You seem to have the expectation that Dae-woong will come to like you. How do you know for sure? Dae Woong said that I was special I can run fast and jump high. He said that I was great There's a car that goes fast and a plane that flies very high... Even though those abilities may be special, they're useless. I . . . Can hear and see very good from far away. Those abilities.. I bet you that you can't do better than this. He even complimented that I eat a lot! That means that you spend a lot of money He might like girls who make a lot of money but girls who spend a lot of money, he might not accept that I'm really pretty That .... I acknowledge that But just trusting beauty, and throwing your body at someone, there are consequences to that kind of action. I'm giving you strong advice.. In the future, don't try to mate with Cha Dae Woong Then what do i have to do? Don't just blatantly ask for everything you want like you're doing right now But instead, try learning about what humans want the things Dae Woong wants? You like these, right? Eat while you think Am I a dog? I'm sorry for misunderstanding. Dont eat it in public! maiden (girl)... maiden (girl)... That sounds too creepy maiden maiden (girl)? dorky Dae Woong! Yeah... Since you gave me this as a present I also want to give you what you want What would you be happy with? I wish you'd be quiet. I said I want to do something for you! Tell me what you want Woooooooooooooooong! Be quiet! You won't even listen to me to be quiet What do you mean you'll do anything for me? I'll give you everything you want Really? Then... If I told you to quit your meat addiction, will you? To a Gumiho I don't intend to ask something difficult don't worry about it and be quiet please. I'll be quiet so... Even though it's later, make sure you tell me. I'll do it right away I'll think about it Someone's coming! What's the matter? The director told us to come here and rearrange. Director! While I am filming this movie, that room up there, please let me stay there. We usually use that place for storage. is there a problem? It's because i want to focus on the movie. If i stay here, I can focus and practice as much as I need to i'll think about it. I'll be a great caretaker. i'll do some late-night guard duty. I'll always clean i'll even wipe down the equipment. oh, there's dust on the sign already! I will clean that that nicely for you. I cleaned that yesterday. If you stay here, then your aunt will probably come by. I'll tell my aunt not to come by. Oh no, no. I'm not the type of guy to tell someone not to come around. You can stay here. Thank you! Oh, right! While you were here, did you see a girl in a white dress with long hair? She jumps high and runs fast. Did you happen to come across her? If you happen to see her, get her phone number! Miho-ah? Could you possibly... Did the Director... see you when you broke the wall? I'm not sure. Last time he saw me and tried to chase me. Really? Miho, just in case... Make sure the Director doesn't see you. If you see him, You should just run away Real action, my dream. What's your name? I don't even know your name. Director, There's a place with udon soup for lunch. Shall we go? Udon soup.. For a while, don't bring up eating udon. Then what do you want to eat? Black food. Jjajangmyeon (black bean noodles) Yah this is really great. That... only chosen people can get it. it's a limited edition that isn't sold publicly. If it's a limited edition, is that a good thing? Of course! Yah, with this, you look like a total fashionista! Is that also good? It means that you look cool. oh i was calling so that we can go to the public bath together Ahjumma! My bag is cool isn't? Wow, your bag is cool too. Ahjumma's also a fashionista! Thanks! I'll come to eat chicken for dinner. Okay. When did you become friends with that ahjumma? What do you mean, "friend?" You greeted each other, and talked about fashion. And complimented each other. That's a friend. Oh, its like that Then the chicken lady is my friend. You're making friends on your own, you're pretty cool. Who is this? You're Cha Dae Woong, right? This is Park Dong Joo. Who are you? Could you put Mi Ho on the phone, please? Mi Ho? Is it Dr. Dong Joo? He said he wants to talk to you! Oh, Dr. Dong Joo! It's me. I was curious on how everything's going. Are you doing well? Yeah. Hold on! Hey! Just take the call here! I took Dr. Dong Joo's advice, and didn't say anything about mating Did you also find out what Cha Dae Woong wants? He's going to tell me later If there's something Dae Woong wants, I will listen to him. They look quite close I'll visit you later! Who was that? Park Dong Joo. Dr. Dong Joo is also my friend Friend? Dr. Dong-joo. Coming to visit? It seems she thinks I'm her friend. Because she doesn't really know what I've told her to do. That can happen. To the point where you go hang out with them... you had someone you got close with? Yeah. He's really good to me and nice. Because he doesn't know your Gumiho, that's why he's good to you and nice. Hiding your identity and going to hang out... Isn't that wrong? What does he do for a living? How did you meet him? Woong. Don't ask about Dr. Dong-joo. It's not that I'm curious.. It's because I'm worried about that person. Don't even worry. I'm not going to do anything bad to Dr.Dong-joo Will not do anything bad? You threaten to eat me, and drive me crazy about buying meat... And you're going to act nice to a new friend? Later, since I'm uncomfortable that something may happen to that person Tell him not to call my phone. Ok. I'll tell him not to call you. I'll just visit him. It was a young guy... After seeing her face, he must've been attracted. foolish Wow, she's so pretty! surrounded by foolishness. Since the bus is here, let's go. You always told me to stay far away from you.. Why did you come next to me? I wasn't going to pay any attention to it, but i have a duty to protect the foolish so there's no way not to step in. my childhood dream was batman but i never thought i'd protect the world this way How annoying. Excuse me, What?! What? Are you Cha Daewoong senior right? I'm your junior from the same high school. Do you remember me? Junior... Yeah I kind of recognize your face. Really? Your name? Mi-nyu, Go Mi-nyu That's right, Mi-nyu! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I even gave you a letter at your graduation. Really? You got more handsome. Mi-nyu, You got prettier too. I'm getting off at the next stop. Senior, you changed your number right? Yea, I change my number. My number is- I'm sorry for interrupting while you were with your girlfriend. Mi-nyu, take care. Mi-nyu, take care. This ring is really good. Just by showing it, people leave us alone. Yeah, they just all leave. Woong-ah You... Are you mad you didn't get to talk to her anymore? It was a close junior that I haven't seen in a while... I couldn't even greet her properly and let her leave because of you. If I just left it, I was worried you'd want to follow her and mate. What do you take me for? Hey! I am not this kind of man. Even if I was that popular, I'd only like one person and I've never drifted. That one person... Is it that one girl from last time? Yeah. It's Hye In noona. If you liked her, why didn't she become you girlfriend earlier? I was going to and even got a ring prepared, but I didn't. Possibly... Is that ring .. This? You were going to give it to her and since she didn't want it You gave it to me?! noona didn't say she didn't like me. Even if we ask her right now, she'll say that she likes me. You shouldn't do that! I know. That's why I didn't do it. I didn't give her the ring and... You're wearing it instead. What is this? This was meant for her? Hey! You wearing the ring that I was going to give to noona... Me giving it to you makes me sadder. If you don't like it, you can give it back. Okay, I'll take it off too. it's been giving me anxiety. If I take it off, it's better for me.. Nevermind! Just leave it on. Go. Why? Are we going somewhere only people can go again? now you're getting a hang of it. Wait here. While singing~ Calling your name while dreaming~ Only as your woman~ Beautifully, I'll only see you~ While singing~ Calling your name while dreaming~ Only as your woman~ Beautifully, I'll only see you~ Should I... Let you go in there too? I can go in too? Well, even though you make me a little nervous, I'll do my best to keep you in line But, you have to sit quietly and look around. You can't cause an accident. Okay. I'll only look around. Let's go in. Wait! Dust off the dirt here. Let's go. Here.. You just have to listen to what the professor says. You just have to listen? That's right. And once in a while, if the professor asks for someone to speak You can't make eye contact. Alright. Because there are many acting scenes, I should adjust my class schedule. Yeah. So cool. Since it's odd for you to just be here, open this and look at it. What is this? This is writing too? This is English, English. Ooover there, a different country's writing. Can you read this too? Read it. Mi Ho, you seem really nervous. I'm so nervous, it's like all the hair on my tails are standing up. Okay to help your nervousness, I'll go get the bubbly water, so Wait here. Since you're not a student, don't stand out. Okay. It feels like I'm human. If I fall asleep during class, it's going to be embarassing, better drink coffee. Dae Woong! You want to buy coffee? Yea. Then, can you get me a juice? Ah, coins... What kind of juice? Oh, there's some fruit juice. Fruit is good for your skin and health- Drink this.. Could I get two? I'm going to eat sandwiches with a friend. Two? Did you come for class? Yeah. Where's your class? That way. Here, Noonim. Thank you. Also, I'm sorry, Dae Woong. Last time while trying to prevent you out of worry, I think I was a little harsh. But you know how I feel, right? Yea. Noona, it turned out good for me. You don't have to worry about it. Have a good class. I'm going. Noona, I'll call you. Oh, jeez! It went way to far. Come quickly. I'm gong to give this to someone, wait just a minute. Oh! Noona? This is really interesting. What was that for? You're surprised right? You're surprised. I knew you'd be surprised. Since I surprised you, I guess I'm worthy of surprising. You were playing around again? Why did you come to the class? Ah! This sandwich . . . For you to eat. Ah, a sandwich? Thank you, Noona. Isn't it time to start the lecture? I have nothing to do. Should I sit in with you? I don't have lecture. It was a mistake. I told Byung Soo to register and here was a misunderstanding. You don't have lecture? Then let's eat together. Of course! I'll go get my bag, so count to a hundred and don't move. Okay. Ah! Look at this. Oh. There's been a problem with administration so I need to go to their office. Ah, is that so? Let's go! Ah, Mi Ho! You said you wanted to listen to class. You stay here and I'll go by myself. Don't go anywhere else and stay here. Okay? Since this if for the class, look at this. If you're bored, write down what the professor says. I'll be back. Noona! A chinese restaurant opened near the school, let's go there. Huh? Let's just eat these sandwiches here. I'll buy you something tasty as an apology. Let's go to my car. Nothing should go wrong... To categorize this we need to take the following approach... Student, what? Yes? The student who raised her hand. What is it? It's a fly! Curious for no reason. Like Dae Woong said, you can't make eye contact with them. I guess I'll have to wait outside. Um, I'll have jjajangmyun (noodles in black sauce). No. I said I'd buy something tasty. Give us two A course please. Yes, Ma'am. A course? Wow, this is really long. Let's eat slowly. Sure. Slowly. When is Dae Woong coming back? Ah, I'm hungry. I guess I'm going to have to go home alone. Daddy, thank you! Real action.. Oh? Wow! So fast. Doesn't seem like she's running that hard. She went up there. She's fast. Why am I like this? My body is weird. You will die slowly. Here is your dessert. Finished. Let's go Why are you eating in such a hurry? You might have an indigestion. I must've been really hungry. The food just slid into my stomach. Let's go noona. I must have gotten indigestion. Aish! What's this? I thought she would've waited, but seems like she just left. I ran really fast and even got indigestion but she didn't even wait. You really did come to visit. My body feels weird. All of a sudden my heart started beating really hard and my throat closed up. Then suddenly my body froze and... ..it was hard They call that pain. Even though you've never gotten sick it must feel weird. Humans get hurt and sick very easily. So then am I... becoming a little human? You can put it that way. From now on you will feel other types of strange things happening to you, and as time goes on it will get worst. Can you bear it? If it means becoming a human I have to. I thought you said that you don't eat meat. I prepared it because you said that you'll come over. Eat well because you're sick. Since that what people are like. If she finds out that it's a day to eat meat on a chicken day, She'll be surprised. Today, I've prepared the highest grade of Korean beef for you to eat Let's turn it on, so we can cook it. It's really cool. She's late... This here is where I live and call home. Wow... That's the Doctor that was on the phone? He seems normal... Come and visit me again... I'll prepare a lot of meat for you. Meat? The meat that you prepared today was really good. Is it really expensive? It is expensive. I see... then I guess Dae Woong wouldn't buy it for me. That girl! What the! You feel fine now. Next time you feel sick, seek me out again. OK Oh it's Dae Woong. There's something I'm curious about... Why do you call me Dong Joo Doctor? You are the Doctor that explained to me how to become human. Therefore you are Dong Joo (Elder) Doctor. Do you fully... ...trust me? Did you lie to me? No. Nothing I've told you is a lie. Although I haven't told you the whole truth... Mm... Then I'll seek you again, so just wait for me. Bye. Dae Woong. Wait for you... You're telling me to wait for you? Oh it's cow. It's Korean beef. No... it's a mountain cattle. Why does a person who's already eaten expensive beef ask for such cheap beef? You heard what Dong Joo Doctor and I were talking about right? Don't you think it isn't right to do such things? Getting really expensive beef and getting outstanding advise, while keeping your identity a secrete. You're a gumiho, are you a flowersnake (seductive creature)? First you call me a dog. and now you call me a snake. Hey, I'm a gumiho. That's right, you're a gumiho. Someone who could break walls must've pretending to be sick. He was so worried about you that he felt your forehead. I'm a helpless girl... I really want to eat beef... really expensive beef. Is it like that? Where's your ring? Oh! The ring! Whoa! It's right here. Aigoo. Found it! Mi Ho you're truly amazing. Not even three grown men can lift this. You're really a special friend. Why was the ring there? Oh... It rolled under the vending machine. I couldn't get it with my own strength. Look here Mi Ho. I found the ring and got this much money. With this much money we could get at least three sodas. So, why was it under here? Why was it under here? As I was taking it off, it dropped. How? I met noona. I didn't want her to see the ring. So while I was taking it off... I dropped it. So today you left me... ...to see that noona right? Yes! I met her. We also ate a meal together. However nothing else happened, and the bead is just fine. Then... isn't everything alright? Then just like you did with the ring... ...when you met with your noona... will you hide me too? Yes, if I could then I would. Is that what you really want? If so... Oh right, you said that you'd do anything that I asked for right? Then if the thing I ask you to do is.. to hide all this from noona, will you listen? I don't want to. I knew that was going to happen. If you weren't going to do anything for me, why did you even offer? Not that! You can tell me something else! There's nothing I ask of you. What in the world would a human ask a gumiho for? There's absolutely nothing... ...that I expect from you Then you... only wanted the bead from me? Why ask if you know already? Why would she keep running away from me? Look at my eyes closely. Do I look like a weird person to you? Truthfully, if someone like you were to come after me... I would run away. Stop chasing that girl... and just make Kim Ye Jin as the main role. This... Are you ok? I'm okay. It stings... it really stings. Yea, I'm almost there. The winebar on the 15th floor? Okay, wait. Thank you (in chinese). Why do you continuously avoid me? Don't be like this. Please let's go of me. Let go. I said let go! Let go! Let go! Director Ban Doo Hong. Are you on my back right now? Let go of me! Director Ban! My dad's phone is off. You're sure the main role hasn't been decided yet right? I'll ask my dad tomorrow. But, the girl that my dad's chasing around, She must be a student at our school. What? It couldn't. My dad told me he saw her at the school. She was at our school? Unni. Did you ask Dae Woong what happened about the couple ring? When I met him he wasn't wearing a ring. Is that so? Byung Soo must have seen wrong? On the way home, I should stop by the Action School to see Cha Dae Woong. Didn't Dae Woong return to his house? He's staying there again. Unni . . . You didn't know that? Why my heart beating like this? Do I have indigestion? Mi Ho, where - ? Hey! Hey hey, what are you doing with your tails come out.. What's wrong Gumiho showing her tails? From now on, I'm going to show my tails and live confidently. You're drunk. You drank the whole box. Eh?! Soju, too? Cha Dae Woong, Cha Dae Woong, you're too much. You're ignoring me too much because I'm not a human. Miho, get to you're senses and hide your tails. Since it's bright, people can see from far away. Turn the lights off on your tails. What you wanted was that? That's right! All right! Then I have to listen to you. Good job. It's dangerous to show your tails. Don't do it again, okay? More! More! Is there anything else you want from me? But, You have to do everything I want. Oh! This sticking out might hurt someone. Put this in. I got it. Hey! Very good. Next! N-next? Then . . . That's too loud over there. Make it be quiet. Our Mi Ho's vocal is really good! Seriously? More! More! More! More? What else? Oh! Catch this flying mosquito. That's what I do everyday already. Do everyday? I caught mosquitos everyday so they wouldn't eat you. So thats why, I never got bitten by mosquito here. I can't catch easily because I drank. This little mosquito, because she's drunk it must be seeing her as incapable. Oh! I got one! Got one by myself! Here's one. Hey. You did that on purpose to surprise me right? Let me see. Show it to me. Show me! Let me see. Gumiho, since your drunk, you're not that big of a deal. Let me see. Let me see. Oh? It's that girl. What? She's coming here. Who's coming? Oh! Mi Ho! Dae Woong! I'll do what you really want me to do. Whatever you want, I'll do it all. Because I like you. Dae Woong? I'm hiding. Mi Ho? Mi Ho?! Mi Ho?! Mi Ho! Mi Ho!
