Honey. Let's get married! I forgot to send Nicky the script for tomorrow's show. He must be very angry. Give me a sec. It was the twelfth… oh no the thirteenth time in this month. I almost had to see the ring that Phillip has been forcing me to wear. Why I wanted to avoid Phillip's proposal? It's simple. To me, 33 is just a number. Even if I was 35. Why have to tie yourself up? Why have to put another pillow on your bed while all you need is just a "magic stick" for one night stand? What’s more? My career has been brilliant. A super hot and top rating TV show with dozens of sponsorship contracts. A husband and a child could ruin everything I have. It's been a relaxing weekend and we're back! I'm Ms. Q! Glad to see you guys again here in Showbiz Secret! Life is beautiful . Why have to worry? Love works just fine. Why have to bury it with marriage? Introducing my sisterhood. These girls are always beside me, whenever I have a boyfriend, as well as when I'm single. Actually they're the reason why I still don't want to get married. At least, for now. Good morning sis! Good morning sis! Chào buổi sáng Nicky. Beautiful cover! Your interview is so witty and snobby, sounds just like Ms. Q. The host of Showbiz Secret. But I haven’t received the script for today's show. So don't expect it to be on-air this afternoon. Ôi không Nicky! I'll send it right away! Stay away from me! Stop acting familiar with me! So over retouching. My eyes do not look that evil. Throw it away! Yes sis. Sis, here’s the final of final script. Who will host today's breaking news? It's Nam Hee. - Tell him to see me. - Yes sis. Hey sis. These are two latest looks from Lam Gia Khang. Which one do you like? Hmm!! Cái này. Okay sis. Remind me about the fitting babe. Noted sis! Sis, our guest refuse to answer any question about the proposal. - If not for those foolishness, will he have chance to be interviewed by Ms. Q? - Does he think I will waste my time chatting with him for nothing? Can I help you sis? Oh! Nam Hee! Let me take care of your sequence this afternoon! What about… Let's stick with that. All set. 3, 2, 1! Lên sóng! Such a dull month it has been when entertainment news is covered with sports news. But don't forget that Showbiz Secret will always brings you hot, exclusive and promising news. And now, let's get back to Ms. Q with our updated breaking news. Please welcome Ms. Q. Thank you, Nam Hee. Ms. Q has always been an expert in bringing surprising and reliable news. So let's see what do I bring you for today. First, we've got some news about actress Mai Yaya. Such a familiar name with Showbiz Secret! Let's see what news this mean girl has got for us this week. Wow... I see a wedding invitation... According to the reliable news source that we've just got. Actress Mai Yaya has sent invitation to all of her friends. - Cam 2 keeps the medium shot, please. …to inform about her monumental wedding ceremony. And her fiancé is a young, rich man. A well-known guy in real estate sector. And he is... Quyen, Quyen, Quyen Keep going! Hey, what's wrong? Why doesn't she read it? Sis, keep going! What a surprise... This talented yet mean actress’ fiancé... Is a popular heartthrob to every woman at the moment… Mr. Phillip Hoang, CEO of King Group real estate corporation and also the major sponsor of Showbiz Secret. I'd like to congratulate to them. And now, let's have a closer look at their fancy invitation which has just been sent to all of their celebrity friends. Such a ridiculous bitch! She must have spent a lot of money to appear on every single magazine covers. Just to tell everyone that at the end there’s one man who dares to put his stick to her silicone valley. Are you crazy? How can you be so relaxed after being cheated on so many times? Are you frigid, Quyen? What? If she is frigid, then what would I be? A virgin? So what? If I were her, I would mix paint with shrimp paste and splash it to that bitch's house. I wouldn't just sit here. What a f*cking bitch! To be honest, it was my fault. I didn't want to marry Phillip. So he had to date another woman. Besides that, you all may know I don't have time to think about having sex or babies. It's so bullshit! Amen! Do you want to be a nun for your whole life? You're back, finally! Xin lỗi. Let me go through please! I have to go straight here to see you right after landing. Ohh, I miss my beautiful sisters so much! I've got a special gift for Ms. Q. One... Two... Three! Bingo! Oh my gosh! This one's yours. This one suits Quyen. And all of these are mine. Is this choker? Stop it! Everyone's watching us. Ignore them! These stuffs are very common in Australia! Put it away. I said put it away! She has no one to play with. Hand it to me. I'll keep it! They broke up. Huh? They broke up. Really? When was it? Look at this. Ôi trời... That bastard... He even stopped sponsoring my show! Cái gì?? Trời đất! It means… the show will be cancelled? It’s true that the show must stop when love ends. Shut up! Don't waste your time for that jerk. It's pretty annoying. - Stand up! Stand up! - Huh? I haven't finished my tea yet. Stop drinking! We must teach him a lesson. Pay for your tea first! Hey! Phillip! You play Quyen, which means you play all of us! Hey, what did you just say? He has never played me. Ever. Step back! Let me finish him. Phillip! I will slice you into small pieces. Cut!! Let me do it! He’s coming. Hurry up! Hey, who's that? I have a surprise for your pleasure. - C’mon sis! - Let’s go! Let me check him first. Turn around, turn around… Wow that's him! How it is? Is he the one you chose? Those websites aren't that reliable. The photos are always different from reality. Right! Let me check. If he's not the right one, I won't let him in. Hmm Why are you so smart? How do you two know this so well? You must have booked male escort before, huh? - No, I have not. - Not in the mood. What are you staring at? Anyway, you know nothing about this. Step back, let me check him. Look! Wow! Absolutely delicious! He's the one. Go open the door. Let’s get laid girls! Hi! I'm Jack. Hi Jack! Thank you, mesdames. I haven't turned 18 yet! Xin lỗi. So...Thank you misses. Yes, let me introduce. The girl who just gave you the wine, is Kiki. Same as my dog's name. She's just turned 17. Simply gorgeous! And this is… Maria... Ozawa 18. And I'm Ton Nu Dai Trang, a year younger than her. You may see us a little too mature. But actually we're still very young. Isn't it, girls? So I'm older than all of you here. Now we have a reason to… cheer! Drink it, drink it! Oh my gosh! Are you ok? - This stupido! - I’m ok. Are you ok? Oh, there she is! Who is she? Make her happy! I got it! May I do it now? No, no, no! It's not what you think. Please do it chastely! We are all veggies. We don't eat meat. So what do you want me to do? My friend, Quyen has got some troubles. We just want you to join us and have some fun. Chỉ có thế thôi! Well that's easy! Have you got extra tee to change? Such a good question. No one bring suitcase all the time like you! Yes. How can you go clubbing with this dirty tee? - Find another one! - Let me go buy one. No need! Let me handle this. I wanna ovulate for him! Just can't wait any longer! I’m ready. Let's go! Hi, sis. Let's go! Let’s party! Hurry up! Let's go hard tonight! What are we waiting for? Hurry up! I took you to your room. Just to keep you warm. Stop right there! - Take off your clothes! - What? Take it off! Why do you wear Phillip's clothes? Hey! Don't let me say it again, okay? - Take it off! - Okay! I said take it off! Okay. Give me a sec! Don't go. Please stay, Phillip! Thanks for a wonderful night… I know that you have put a lot of effort into this. But Quyen, We can afford for only 4 episodes more. 4 episodes? Which means there’re only 4 months left? I can run a big campaign with that amount of money. You’d better prepare for a new TV show from now on. Who would watch this crap? Creating content must base on a strategy rather than writing whatever you want. What are the 3 rules that I taught you guys before? It must be fresh, unique and shocking. This kind of content is all over the internet! No need to watch on TV! Who would spend money sponsoring for this crap? Get back to work! Yes sis. Don't be so harsh, Quyen. We will suffered if they all quit. What should I do now? Showbiz Secret is 5 years now. We’re all running out of ideas. It’s time to make a completely change in order to have new approach. But there’re only 4 episodes left... Keep calm my dear! We still have 4 more. It means there’re only 4 months left, Nicky. We still have 4 months! So you want me to hire some sexy girls to dance striptease in order to get high rating, right? Loser! You sounds exactly like those losers out there! That's not my Ms. Q. Quyen, be strong! Be strong! Stop it! So you go to work early just to encourage me like this? Not really. Actually I will bring you a new breeze that will blow up your tedious life. Just what you required. Fresh blood, fresh brain, and so on. We'll have a new staff. Outstanding background. Graduated communication bachelor in America. Forget it! The budget is running low. How can we afford for an overseas staff? We must try! Even when our chance is just 1%! We must take risk. We must change. We must have a breakthrough! Okay... Whatever... I no longer have the right to decide though. I might even quit before the new staff finishes the probation. This is Lucy’s decision. I also don't have the right to decide. Alright then. When will she be here? Already arrived! Just a sec. By the way, not “she”. It's a guy. A straight guy. For sure. So rare huh? I can scent his American pie smell! My boy! Where are you? Come in! Please get acquainted with our new staff. Quyen! Tadaa! Hi sis! What an American scent! Get acquainted! - Have you read that report yet? - Which report? Wassup? Stop chitchatting! Get back to work! Yes. Nicky! Nicky! Cái gì? I have something to tell you. I just changed my mind. I no longer need a new staff. Have you just said you need new blood new brain? Alright, alright. I do want a new brain, but... I just want someone who is experienced or who has a lot of relationships in showbiz so we will get more tidings! But this guy just came back from America, how can he know anything about showbiz? How can he be the editor? Am I right? Okay, okay... Let's be honest. Lucy wants him to be the intern editor. It's not important whether he is accepted or not. What important is our big boss’ decision. We have no right to decide, okay? I get it, but... Lucy's calling. It must be about Jack. Chị yêu! Yes. Jack’s already met Rose. Titanic is ready to depart. But may I pick another ship? I'm afraid of drowning, I can't swim! - Nicky! - Hi sis! What's your name? I'm Khoi Nguyen - How old are you? - 25. Enough of greetings! Get back to work! Meet me in my office! I have jobs for you. Yes sis! Hey, take this! What is your purpose? I want to experience... No, no, no! I'm asking about your real purpose. What do you mean? Stop acting! Who are you actually? Why do you want to mess with me? Mess with you? Why do I have to mess with you? Stop being foolish. You are trying to approach me in many ways! Whatever. No matter who you work for or for any purposes I will know it in no time. Stop acting and quit the job! Why do I have to quit even on my first day? So you think I would hire a gigolo to work for me? Sis, it's urgent! Your resumé is outstanding! Do your best! Yes. - Sis, can you help me pick this? - Hmm... Bye sis. Which one, sis? Which one, sis? This one! Sorry? - You may go. I'll have a look again. - Yes, sis. These are documents of all the shows and projects of our company. - Please have a look! - Okay, thank you. I'll see it immediately. Just ask me anything. I will explain to you. Inform me if there's any changes. She thinks she's only 16 while she's actually 35. SHUT UP! Jack... Meet me in my office. Jack! Cái quái gì vậy? Really? I get those goosebumps every time I see him. Help me find a way to make him quit! I just can’t focus on my job anymore. Why so serious? Just assign him a task that is impossible to do. If he can't accomplish it, then fire him. Ms. Q always have a reason. - It makes sense. - That's right! Such a rascal. Dare he want to mess with me! I'll mix all kind of beans in a box… No, must be a container and make him classify one by one. Then I'll fire him. Sounds good? Perfect! You're too beautiful to do whatever you want! Am I right? Wassup? What's wrong? Look! Hey! That's him! What a good guy! He carries bags for his mom, right? No! She’s my boss Lucy! Why doesn’t he look like his mom? Or he may look like his dad. Stop being so dumb! She is his mistress! Wow! He likes to play with cougar at his mom’s age. So strong! Let's get out of here! Quick! What now? Say hi to them? Why do you make me crawl? Run, run, run! Have you read the latest article about Mai Yaya? - Not interested. - Let me read it for you. As a legal representative of King Group I announce that King Group is no longer sponsoring Showbiz Secret! Which means the show will stop broadcasting in the coming time. This stupid bitch... Does she even know how to speak to the press? Do you need a lawyer? - What now, sis? - What now? How should I answer them? How can I answer him, sis? - What now, sis? - There's no sponsor. I don't know. The show has to stop! No more sponsorships! Oh my dear! This is disaster! Check this out. All TVC bookings in Showbiz Secret’s timeslot have been cancelled! This is so brutal! We are so done. No bookings, no sponsorships. Titanic is truly wrecked, Rose! How come… Sis… Lucy wants to see you. In this situation... we can’t afford to produce 4 more episodes as I promised. What do you mean? I can’t produce a show which is no longer benificial. It is the matter of business now. You know how much it costs for 60 minutes broadcast in prime time, don’t you? I… I don't know what to say, but... I understand your effort. So I have tried to convince the board of directors to give you the last chance. You have 2 episodes left. It's up to you! If you can keep Showbiz Secret alive and get sponsored again then we will continue doing this. Otherwise… I have to replace it with another show. - 2 episodes more? - Yes. Okay! I... …thank you. Before, if someone told me that life is full of surprises, I would have just laughed at them. I have never imagined that one day all doors will close in front of my eyes like this. My relationship, career and fame. I almost lost everything in a blink of an eye. But c'est la vie. Always full of challenges. And now, I have no choice to face it. Production meeting in 1 minute! Hurry up! Showbiz Secret is my life, my passion and my career. They can not be destroyed easily like that. Just wait and see. It's me to turn the tables I have to save myself, save Showbiz Secret on my own rather than waiting for anyone or any miracles. Alright, topic’s confirmed. But we're still missing a guest for “Talk to Ms. Q" session. Any suggestions? How about we invite the couple Tran Giang and Nam Phuong again? - What? - What? They're probably the hottest couple right now, aren't they? Are you out of your mind? Try yourself! That couple is arrogant as hell. Even sis Quyen got rejected by them. I guess we have to forget self-esteem and invite them again. It is our last chance, isn't it? Alright, keep brainstorming. Remember to email me before 12am. Yes sis. Keep up the good work. I see you… still here so I… What's wrong with that? Xin lỗi… Bye. Actually, I’m wondering if I could help you with anything? What can you... Just assign him a task that is impossible to do. If he can't accomplish it, then fire him. So you and me… We will make a bet, ok? I have a task for you. If you accomplish it, you can continue working here. But if you fail, just send me your resignation letter. Wanna play? Okay. Let's do it! I want you to invite the married couple, Tran Giang and Nam Phuong to our show. Okay. Deal. Sounds like an easy job to you. Your deadline is 12am tomorrow. If you can’t do it, just tell me before quitting. Don't worry, sis. You know that I am very professional. Grande americano của Ms. Q. Cám ơn! Grande latte đá của Tommy, cám ơn! What? Oh my God! Are you playing him? It couldn't be more brutal! It's no different from telling him to quit! That's not true. He was really confident about it. He just simply accepted it. I did not force him by any means. Do you think that Showbiz Secret will be saved if he succeeds? Forget it! It's not that easy! This couple has never accepted to be directly interviewed! They are smart as hell. They checked every article carefully 3 to 4 times before signing to publish. Every questions must be sent to their manager first. If succeeding, this interview will be the first and only. It's gonna be huge! - Huh? - Ah… You're right! In your dream! Can't believe it! Hail Jack! What's going on? - Hail Jack! Hail Jack! - Hail Jack! - Hey! - What the hell is that? Are you crazy? Stop shouting! Jack has successfully booked Tran Giang and Nam Phuong to our show! - What? - It’s true! - Really? - Yes! Someone pinch me, please! Ahhh… That hurts! Wanna kill me? So this is not a dream! Titanic will not be wrecked! We're all rescued! Bye, sis. Stop that childish game! This is not kindergarten. Get out! I dropped my pencil. It's actually a pen... What is this? Why did you put it on my desk? I just went out for pizza. There’s buy one get one free promotion. So I brought one for you. Do you know that women won’t eat anything after 8pm? I know. But... Anyway, I appreciate your discount pizza. And now… Go home and send me the questions for that couple. Deadline is 12am tonight, got it? Yes, I got it. This pizza… I’ll throw it away for you. I forgot my keys. Welcome back to “Talk to Ms. Q”! Today's episode is going to be the most special and also the most memorable! Our guest for today is currently the hottest couple in showbiz. But most importantly, they have never been together in any interview before. Please stay tuned! Cause right now, live from the studio of Showbiz Secret. Please welcome, Tran Giang and Nam Phuong! How's the rating? It's at an average level. Don't forget to count advertising slots during the show. Yes sir. You've refused to join Showbiz Secret time after time. Is it because you’re afraid that I would exposed some hidden secrets between you two? Actually we refused not only Showbiz Secret but all the interviews. Oh, kinda weird huh?? You've already got married, but why do you rarely go to events together? We both want to be known as who we are. About personal matters, we'd love to keep it for ourselves. Really? You keep it so hard that no one knew when you two had dated but suddenly got married. Please sign in this form, sir. - Where? - Right here, sir. I have to go… Honey. I have a fitting session with Do Manh Cuong. Excellent! What's wrong with you? Such a bitch of showbiz. - Dat, turn on Tran Giang’s wireless for me. - Yes sis. Why did she ask such irrelevant questions? She totally did not follow the script. My secret was close to be revealled. C'mon. A friend in need is a friend indeed! Friend? If you had not help me with this, I would have been fired. Fired? I thought you were the boss here. Why being fired? Anyway, remember our date tonight. We’ll drink til drop, okay? Ah… I can’t. I have to take her to an event. We have to go together sometimes otherwise people will constantly gossip! What? Don't you guys live together? She doesn't want to. Our marriage contract doesn't have that term. Contract? But I think sooner or later we will have to move in together. If someone know the truth, we’ll dead. Alright then. Just hit me up when you're free. My birthday is on the 21st next month I will throw a private party at my villa. You and your chick will be invited. There's only one month left How can I find one in such a short time? Just find one! One more thing. This is private party Keep your mouth shut. And most importantly, do not let Ms. Q know about this by any chance. I don't want to be on the headline. Okay, okay. Sure. I'll try to find a girlfriend to join your party, okay? Okay! We’re dead! It was the first time we interviewed Tran Giang but the rating’s not that good. There must be problem with the audience. I think it's you who have problem! Your questions were so boring! Where is my incisive, snobby Ms. Q? Why did you take it so easy on them? Why didn't just do it like you did with Mai Yaya? You should have made them dazed! Why didn't you mention about the rumor that they're having a marriage contract? Why? I was desperately waiting for you to raise that issue. But you were just playing around with them by some irrelevant questions. Why? Where is my bitchy Quyen? Coz I don’t have any evidence! You know me, Nicky. People may insult me many times by calling me “the bitch of showbiz” but no one has had the guts to sue me. It is because what I say are always based on proofs, not on the crappy internet! Okay! Just do what you want. Just show everyone what you've got. But... You must find that proof. It is the last episode, Quyen. Dead or alive, it's your choice. Gosh... It is destiny! Titanic is going to be wrecked sooner or later. Nicky, you... But please don't take me with you, okay? - I don't want to die! - I can't swim! Nicky! Nicky! We must find that proof. It is the last episode, Quyen. Dead or alive, it's your choice. Don't you guys live together? She doesn't want to. Our marriage contract doesn't have that term.

I'm a Leo but don’t know why I enjoy eating seafood than meat. What's wrong with your face? Are you allergic to seafood? Do you itch somewhere?? I'll buy you some medicine! Fortunately you ate only a small crawfish. If it was a lobster, you would have been taken to the ICU of the hospital. Shut your mouth! Why do you keep saying bad words? It was fortunate that you took the medicine on time. Damn it. I have never imagined one day Ms. Q would go after a guy like this. That’s right! Too many things happen to you at once. It’s like... Your glorious time has ended! Stupido! Stop saying crappy things! Hey, it seems that he already got into you. - Let's move to the last step! - That's right! There's only one week left! Let's do it! That’s right! Step 3: The plane takes off! To the sky!!! Why does he have to work as a male escort with that face and body? So wasteful! - Because he's passionate about it! - What? Passionate? Passionate to be a boy toy? But it’s weird. He can choose anyone he likes, why the old Lucy? She must be older than his mom I bet. - Just imagine she will scream like hell. - Oh yeah! Oh yeah ...Oh yeah! Turn down you volume. Focus on our job. Here you are! Thank you. Ah… I almost forgot this special ingredient! There we go. - Hey... - You know what... What? This little rosemary contains rosmarinic acid and flavonoid which protect you from becoming oxidized. Really good for women. It helps slow down aging. I don't feel like using it at the moment. - Give it to me. Take it all out. - Hey, hey! There's more. The scent of rosemary oil is also good for people who is stressed or crabby. Smell it! You mean I usually being crabby? Smell it! It's really effective! I told you that I’m not crabby. There's no reason to smell this thing! Try it! It's not gonna kill you! I said I am not crabby! Why did it fall down here? I… Just for you, okay? I'll smell it as you told me to, okay? It doesn't mean I'm crabby. It smells sooo good! So relaxing! The scene is so relaxing! - Hey, Quyen. - Huh?

I believe that the next episode won't be the last one. Try your best! How do you know that? I mean... We still have chance! That's what I mean. Let's go gals! Look at that muscle meat! 1, 2, 3! It smells soo good! Yum! Do not ever touch what belongs to others, girls! You all know the consequences, right? We just wasted a sleeping pill on her. How can we get him to sleep now? Should we order a take away medicine? Are you crazy? It is sleeping pill, not fried chicken, okay? Dai Trang had to steal it from the hospital! No one would sell it to you! See? - See? - What? It's your fault. Why didn't you just steal a dozen instead of just a pill? You see what, he's swimming when he's supposed to sleep. While the one who supposed to be awake is sleeping like a pig! I'm not sleeping. I'm thinking. Hey… Who said I have only one pill? There’s a half left! Does it work with half a pill? Not sure. Maybe half awake, half asleep. That must be fun! Put it in! Quickly! He's coming! Hey… Are you thirsty? Drink this ! Thank you. Drink up! - Mission accomplished. We are pleased to retreat. - Let’s go! Do whatever you like but make sure he will think that you guys have boom boom the whole night, okay? After getting out of the bed tomorrow morning you must have a new position, okay? Alright, alright! Please leave. Why rush, my sister? Have fun with his little baby! You forgot to leave a $2 bill. Why do you keep silent? Unlike last night… I... I... - I... - I what?

Save it for dinner boy. I’m gonna have a meeting with Nicky. OMG! Do I have to wait for more than 8 hours? Are you out of your mind? How could you approve this crappy content? It is the last episode, Quyen! Oh my God! Okay, okay Nicky. Calm down! I have a secret to tell you. Stop seducing me. It's no use! Come here! Sit down and listen to me. I am about to have the marriage contract of Tran Giang and Nam Phuong! Isn't it enough to save us? You are out of your mind! Stay away from me! Haven’t I ever done anything I said? Just wait for me until next week. I will have that marriage contract in my hand! Everyone in showbiz will turn crazy! Showbiz Secret will exclusively announce that! Not only our show will be saved but also our company will be beneficial. Lucy will definitely worship us like Gods! Bravo! Bravo! I hope it's true. Nicky! It will be for sure! Trust me.

That's right. - Alright, get up here! - Okay, okay! Hurry up! Hey, hold this for me or else I will fall! Hey blondie! Why don't you just climb up here? - I'm afraid of height. - So stay down there watching the car! - Nope. I’m afraid of ghost! - Ghost’s afraid of you to be true! Hey someone’s coming! So this is why you're late, huh? Hi, Ms. Q. Hi! It's my pleasure to be invited here tonight. Who invited you? I invited Jack's girlfriend only. - Go talking to your guests. - Được rồi. Would you like anything to drink? Wine, please. Okay, one sec. I hope you come here today… as Jack's girlfriend. Not as the host of Showbiz Secret. Hey, bro! - Khoẻ không? - I'll talk to you later. - Sinh nhật vui nha! - Cám ơn mày! Where are you? Okay. - We're here! - Here… - Hurry up! - Okay, okay. Be careful, girls! Quick! We're here!

You’re always thinking about yourself! Why don’t you care about how pathetic we are right now? Why don’t you ask if we are dead or alive? or how we can get home? You say we don’t know how to use our brain, don’t you? I guess not, Quyen. If we had known how to use our brain, we wouldn't have taken risk and climbed down from 2nd floor to bring this home for you. You guys, let’s go! Maria! I… I’m sorry. You know me. I did not mean that. Just because I was so worried... We have put so much effort just to trick that guy and get this contract. How could I keep calm when seeing the contract being burnt? C'mon! I'm so sorry. Alright, just sit down. Sit down. Don’t make it serious! Mission is completed. We got the contract already. Don't worry. That's right! I think Jack is no longer exploitable.

We must focus and try our best! We must focus and try our best for the show Then we have to say thanks to Jack. Our almighty Jack! - Do you know about Jack and... - Jack and Lucy? - Jack and Lucy...? - You know about that, too? See! I have told Lucy before! Let Jack work here will make people gossip. Hey, I tell you this But do not tell anyone. The truth is, Jack is Lucy's stepchild with her ex-husband in America. - Jack is Lucy's son? - Yes. Shhh! Poor him. If he hadn't begged and convinced Lucy, she wouldn't have spent money for us to do the last 2 episodes. You know, our budget was tight! He helped us in silence. He even told me not to tell everyone about that. How lovely he is! Jack, I love you! Where is he? Why hasn't he been to work? Is he in the restroom? What's wrong? Hey, I'm not finished! Quyen! Quyen! Do not tell anyone about that! Quyen! Hey, Ms. Q? Let me! Dare! You're dead, man! What should we ask him to do? How about ... Working a male escort? You have to sign up as a male escort right now. You have to take every bookings, regardless of their gender. It will only be accepted when you finish the task. You okay with that? OK! Cheers! That's the story. It was just our game. Jack is actually not a male escort as you thought. You share his home but you don't even know where he is? Maybe, he's gone back to America. I also haven't been able to call him. Why don't you water the plant? He wouldn't let me touch it. He said this is the love tree that only him would take care of it. You know what? The scent of rosemary oil is really good for people who is stressed or crabby. Smell it! It's really effective! I told you that I’m not crabby. There's no reason to smell this thing! Try it! It's not gonna kill you! I said I am not crabby! It's all set up. Hey! Where's Ms. Q? Go back to work. Go inside. Oh dear! I swear to you... Today the rating is going to reach the peak! It's going to make the history! I can't wait to the showbiz breaking news section. I'm so shaking right now! Do your best, dear! Be strong! I will. Thank you. - But Nicky… - Huh? If... If what? Nothing. Alright then! Do your best, okay? Time to go! Let’s make it big! Booom! The show has started! Turn on the TV. - Come over here sis! Quick, quick, quick. Showbiz breaking news is a popular section which has built the brandname for Ms. Q and Showbiz Secret After 5 years, I surely believe that... there have been so many celebrities out there who are afraid of being exposed in my show. And the audience is always crave for knowing who will be Ms. Q’s next victim. Just wait and see… Boss, I think she doesn't follow the script. Throw this away! Everything’s in her mind. Just wait! - It's gonna be exploded! Booom! - Today... ... all celebs who have been exposed and the audience will get their revenge. Because our guest for today is no one but… a person who has been making many celebs terrified… a person who has a nickname... “The bitch who invades celebs' private life" That person is me. Ms. Q of Showbiz Secret. What did she just say? For all of you, Showbiz Secret has just been a TV show... - Where’s that part? - It is not in the script, boss. that you watch every last Sunday of the month. - Ôi trời ơi! - You criticize, you laugh then you forget But for every celebrities, - Quyen! - Showbiz Secret has always been a trap… - Are you killing me? - Spying on their lives anytime and anywhere. Having an affair? Fake marriage to get brand ambassador contract? Playing dirty tricks with colleagues? Taking drugs? Doing nothing but taking sexy photos? Or dating plastic surgeons just to have surgeries for free? Sooner or later all of them will be exposed in our show. Because of that, I've been threatened to be killed so many times. But I’m just doing my job. Showbiz Secret is not just a job, ...it is my life. I'm passionated about it. I love revealing dark sides of this fancy, sparkling world. I'm addicted to hunting and exposing your idol's mysteries. I'm excited to take off their fake mask by my own hands. Because of that, you have known who I am. From an amateur editor... now I got thoudsands of like for every photo on my Facebook. Everyone asks to have a photo with an autograph of me. But will there be a price for all of it? Will that sparkling life... truly make me feel happy? I know it might be too late for an answer... cause now I’m paying for that… and I'm slowly losing myself. Cut to the ads! The ads now! I'm dead! - The rating is increasing. I came to this job just innocently like any others. - What? Are you joking? - What now? who think showbiz is a holy place for art. Cut to the ads or keep rolling? I have an inspired job Just wait! I can meet many celebrities Give me! and making news about them. Who doesn't want to be a part of that fancy, sparkling world? But then... just because of rating, sponsorships... and it’s because of audience who enjoy listening to shocking news... exposing other people and finding other's weaknesses in order to criticize or to laugh at. I have turned Showbiz Secret into an hour full of shocking moments... criticism... and invading celebrities’ lives. - How’s the rating? - It's 4.3 and keep increasing. Time goes by… - Increasing? My show’s getting lost What the hell is going on? And now... When it comes to this job... I don't really expect to have a good show. Not for rating... and not to satisfy my audience. It is because of my selfishness! I desire to revenge. I want to prove my position I want to be the most powerful one that everyone’s afraid of. And Showbiz Secret... has became a tool for me to gain respect and worship from every celebs. There's someone... who couldn't even know who they are and what they want. They're unfortunate people. And I... I've been living the worst days of my life and I didn't even notice it. I met a guy. He came to me... pulled me up from that swamp. But because of my desire... my selfishness that made me accidentally push him away without knowing that... he's the one who helped me. For the first time... I finally realized who I was for the first time. Being with him made me realize that I have made so many mistakes. And now... I don't want to make mistake anymore. You... If you're in front of the TV... if you're watching the show and listening to me. I'm not begging you to come back... or to forgive me. I just want to tell you that... After everything we've been through together... After 30 days full of lies and tricks… My feeling for you... was real. It was real and I've been struggled with it... I have lied to you many times but right now... I just want to speak for my heart once! Jack... I love you! Dễ thương quá! I love you too, Jack! Shut up! This crazy bitch just made me cry... I'm sorry, sis. Sorry for what? When rating and advertisement slots for the previous episode... have just made a new record! Have a look! It's 11.0 What’s more, I’ve just received two phone calls from my partners. They asked me to be Showbiz Secret’s exclusive sponsors! It's such a lucky day for you, for me and also for Showbiz Secret! You just had an excellent performance! Just like Ms. Q! Congratulation! Showbiz Secret is continued from now on. Thank you. And I also want to apologize. Cause I will… no longer hosting Showbiz Secret. There’ no more Ms. Q from now on and that previous show... is my last one. Good bye. - Hey! You can't park here! - Wait! Let me go through please! Don’t you see it’s red light? Quyen! Quyen! Quyen! Stop the car! Are you insane? You exposed yourself just to save the show? Quyen? So everything you said… is real? In your mind the whole time... No... In everyone's mind... that everything I do... is fake and deceptive. I’m used to it. I'm totally fine. You can think whatever you want. Why didn't you just show the proof that you have tried so hard to get? I've been hurting so many people with Showbiz Secret! If I continue... I will lose everything… Including you. Jack... I'm sorry. I'm sorry! How come those young guys can resist from beautiful and experienced women like us? No matter how strong we are, we must act innocently and fragile so that they will offer their shoulders to us. We must make them think that they're the one But in fact, they're just one of those! Cheers!!! It's important to master the game. It has to be smooth, flexible Don't rush but accurate! We must make them think that they're controlling the game. But in fact, they're being controlled by us! Stay relaxed... One step at a time... You must know when to be fast, when to slow down, when to strike and when to stop. We must bring the prey to the top, then immerse them in the bottom of society! - "Society" what? - Wrong line. And CUT!
