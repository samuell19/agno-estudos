The Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich has died... - Good Lord! - ... this morning. State mourning. Get black flags quick! And lower the Reich flag to half-staff. Yes, commissar. We must not give in now, my dear. We must be rigid and remorseless! For our Reich and for our Fuhrer. 8th Form, 1942 Towards higher principles Grammar School in Kostelec Your graduation exams couldn't have come at a worse time, lads. They're hanging black flags! Look, he pegged out. Black rags! He took the lives of so many people. Towards higher principles... What does it mean? I don't know. Why that's... That's a provocation. - What a scandal! A dirty provocation! - What's the matter? - Are you the shopkeeper? - I am, sir. What's that? What does it mean? It's just student frolic. What? The Reich holds state mourning. Away with it! Get rid of that filth now! - Do you understand? Translate it! - Attention, attention! The German Reich has declared state mourning. - You must get rid of that filth! - At once! State mourning is declared on the whole territory of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The market in Adolf Hitler's Square in Kostelec is closed forthwith. I repeat: The market in Adolf Hitler's Square in Kostelec is closed forthwith. Attention! Attention! Special announcement! Pursuant to the order of the Reich authorities, state mourning is declared in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The market in Adolf Hitler's Square in Kostelec is dissolved forthwith. What an unfortunate idea! This should not have happened. Particularly not now, when Heydrich died. They took it as a provocation. To put such a thing in my shop window was rather inconsiderate of you, sir. They could shut down my shop because of this. Towards higher principles... Nothing passes them unnoticed. It is quite nice. Put it away, please. And destroy it! Farewell. They could ban our graduation exams. Why should they be interested in our graduation exams? They executed 6 people on Thursday, - 12 on Friday and 24 on Saturday! - That's why! The entrance ticket to the new Europe created by German soldiers... The entrance ticket to the new Europe occupied by German soldiers... Geschaffene means created! Europe created by German soldiers... Represents for every Czech... ...his positive attitude to the Reich. His positive... His positive attitude to the Reich. Stop prompting or I'll enter you in the class-book, Rysanek! I was not prompting, I was only repeating the text. Stop the clownery at once! Times are too grave. Havelka to the blackboard! Continue with the translation! For a new soldier, the entrance ticket to German Europe... Quiet! Unsatisfactory. I will not let you take your graduation exams. Go and ask him to give you another chance. You can't let bloody German ruin your graduation. I will not let Havelka take his graduation exams, colleague. But Havelka is a good student. Slightly exam shy perhaps. Could you give him one last chance, my dear colleague? You can afford that humanism of yours in Latin lessons but I will not let myself be hunted by the German authorities! Hello, Alois. Why on earth did you come here? No one saw me. Besides, I can come here as your customer, can't I? Sit down. - What's new? - I spoke to our boss. You'll get a bonus. A 1,000 crowns for every case. - You can earn a lot of money. - Can I? That's fine. - Good day. - What do you want? Could you give me 20 crowns, Daddy, I need them at school. Just a moment, please. These shoes pinch, Mr. Zajicek. I'll come at another time. Farewell, madam. - Give it to me! - It's for duty stamps. - Shut up and get out! Sorry, I didn't know it was private business. Mind your own business and make sure the exams don't floor you! They're beating at my heals only because of you! Get out! All in all, no harm was done. Some idiot shouted himself hoarse. What about it? - Magnificent. - I beg your pardon? Seneca. I used to get a satisfactory mark in Latin. Although oppressed and harassed by the power of the enemy, it still would be disgraceful to retreat. Safeguard the place bestowed upon you by Nature. What place is it, you ask? The place of man. That's quite topical, my dear colleague. Even after two millennia. The times of Nero were quite idyllic compared to what is happening today. You haven't chosen this as the topic for the exam essay, have you? Of course not. But I did select a few fine passages. In the Annals by Tacitus, there is an interesting trial with Cremutius Cordus, who is dying of starvation. Magnificent ideas are brought forward in the end. None the less, I was truly tempted by Seneca for his moral principle. There's a telegram for you, sir. - For me? - Yes, sir. Has something happened? It's from my daughter-in-law in Prague. They arrested my son. How dreadful! It's just gone three o'clock. You can catch the express to Prague. But I have a Czech lesson in the 8th form. Go, my dear colleague. I will fill in for you. Towards higher principles... After the war is over. - Isn't it a pity? - Nothing doing. - State mourning is state mourning. - They should have let us know. We could have made it as an obituary. Jana. Alois. What shall we do with Mr. Principle? Give it to me. We'll give it to him at our graduation party. - If there is any. - What do you mean? - Why shouldn't we have a party? - Maybe they'll order us to mourn. The Three Musketeers. Here, Vlasta. Look, what a coincidence! - The Reich Protector. - Show me. The SS Obergruppenführer has acceded to office. He didn't last long. Give it to me. Don't fool around with it! Here's something to remind you of school. The Czech lesson is over! Vandas left to Prague! Where are you going, students? Home, sir. The Czech lesson is over, Professor Vandas went to Prague. I shall fill in for my colleague. Let us indulge in a Latin lesson, shall we? Find Seneca's Letter 6 to Lucilius. Excuse me, sir, but we thought that as long as we are writing our essays tomorrow... That is why we shall refresh ourselves with Seneca. - Please, sir. - Rysanek may begin. We thought it would be more refreshing to spend the afternoon by the pond, sir. Vis tu cogitare istum, quem servum tuum vocas. Translate, Rysanek. If you wish to think, then think. Else kindly consider that the one, whom you call your slave... Sit down, Rysanek. Your mind is obviously resting by the pond. This lesson was to be an extraordinary one. However, a higher moral principle does not allow me to force you into anything. Go to the pond then and study for your essay tomorrow. Come here, Havelka! Professor Richter will re-examine you tomorrow after the essays are finished. Leave exam fever behind and go over it again by the pond. Thank you, sir. Wait. And what about me, sir? You have grossly neglected your studies and have four unsatisfactory marks. Unfortunately, you shall not be allowed to take the graduation exams. Blimey! I failed in four subjects. - How dare you! - Get out! One cannot educate a person by force. Not even Zajicek. What's all this? You're running like a herd of buffalos! Professor Malek let us go home, sir. - Good day. - What is it? Forgive me, sir, but we're writing our Latin essay tomorrow. Do you know the topic by chance? Well! Come here, Skalova. - Read the annals of Tacitus. - Yes, sir. About some Cremon... - Cremutius? - Yes, Cremutius Cordus. Cordus, that's him. He was on a hunger strike, wasn't he? I am sorry, Mr. Zajicek. You are in arrears with your taxes for 3 years. You didn't respond to the collection letters we had sent. - You don't mean to fine me, do you? The law applies to you as to anyone else. Distrain the property, executor. Shop shelves, two pieces. I beg your pardon, sir. American cash register. I will get even with you elsewhere! - You're home from school already? - Mr. Principle let us go earlier. Because of our essays tomorrow. - Let me help you, Mummy. - You'll get all wet. I hope I will find a job soon. And when I do, I never want to see this dirt again. You must carry on with your studies after the war. I want you to become someone. Karel Moucka will study medicine. He has an auntie in Prague, he said I could share a room with him. And if I earn some money by giving private lessons... There's no need. I will send you money. I'll take some more laundry. No. You'd work yourself to death, Mummy. I can scratch along on my own. You'll see I'll become someone even without a doctor's degree. - Good day. - Oh my, Miss Skalova. But I told your mother, the laundry will be ready tomorrow. Vlasta is just wringing your blouse. I didn't come for the laundry. I came to see Vlasta. - What do you want? - I know the topic of the Latin essay. Vondracek told me. When Mr. Principle writes it on the blackboard tomorrow will do for me. Maybe for you! But I thought you could help me with it. I can't find it. I'm busy right now. In that case, bye. Goodbye. Help her, Vlasta. I do their laundry. Jana, wait! Let's go. Egressus dein senatu vitam abstinentia finivit. That could be it, don't you think? He then left the Senate and ended his life by starvation. Cremutius Cordus? Because he stood up for the Caesar's killers, you see? Translate. Quo magis socordiam eorum inridere libet. Inridere... - Does it mean "to smile"? - It means "to laugh at someone". I see, to laugh at someone. Libet... - Do you wish to laugh at someone? - Nonsense. Socordiam inridere. Inridere socordiam... Is it something of the heart? Cordiality? Stu... Stupi... Stupidity. Don't look and try to think. - Socordiam... - The more laughable is the stupidity... eorum... - Of those... Tacitus meant the temporary rulers, you see? Qui praesenti potentia... Of those... Who think that power can actually efface the memory of future generations. - That's unbelievable. - What? This. Go on and translate. Nam contra punitis ingeniis gliscit auctoritas, neque... On the contrary, the persecution of the ingenuous fosters their respect. Foreign rulers or those who acted as cruelly, have merely procured infamy for themselves and glory for their victims. - It's as if it was written for essays. - Mr. Principle has chosen well. Let's continue. Ceterum postulandis reis... Besides postulandis reis... I would have failed in 4th form if it weren't for you. Let's leave it, I'll bring it tomorrow morning. Just a few days more and graduation will be over. - You know that I'm sorry? - Why? Who knows what will become of us. The Exchange won't go after you, your father will see to that. You'll be playing tennis and dressing up. And then... And then you'll marry some rich man. Are you serious? It's just idle talk. Let's go. Wait, Vlasta. There's something you hate about me, isn't there? It seems to me sometimes, like today at school, that you like me a little. Just like now. It's Stejskalova with the guys. Come on! With Latin one must spread one's wings! Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris Italiam, fato profugus, Laviniaque venit litora multum... - With Latin one must spread one's wings! Stop fooling around! - Bye! - Bye! Wait till Mr. Principle sees this tomorrow. - Lucky they didn't see us. - You'd be sorry if they did. Wouldn't you? No. I'm afraid they'll send you to the Reich. Would you miss me? What will you do? I'll survive somehow. Maybe I'll end up at some farm. But not far away. Based on the judgment of the Court Martial in Prague of June 4, 1942, the following were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad: Cervenka Antonin, born on February 9, 1896 in Tabor, - Syrovatka Josef... - I'm scared, Vlasta. Don't be. Cerensky Frantisek, born on February 6, 1884 in Pardubice, Klima Jan, born on March 28, 1905 in Prague, Ruml Jaroslav, born on July 10, 1881 in Pardubice, Kudrna Rudolf, born on April 17, 1896 in Hradec Kralove, Matous Zdenek, born on February 16, 1891 in Prague, Matousova Marie, born on February 8, 1894 in Prague, Beranek Josef, born on May 22, 1908 in Rakovnik, Vesely Ivan, born on April 26, 1905 in Zlin, Bednarik Cenek, born on April 20, 1904 in Roznov, Prochazka Josef, born on May 10, 1912 in Prague, Prochazkova Eliska, born on August 12, 1913 in Prague, Valenta Jan, born on November 6, 1895 in Kladno, - Klein Jakob, a Jew, born on... - It's dreadful what's happening now. They're slaughtering whole families with children. How can you read at a time like this, sir? I'm not reading, Mrs. Mrazkova. It is Seneca. He was the tutor of Emperor Nero, you know? And when Nero had unleashed the reign of terror, he drove this ingenuous philosopher to suicide. In times of lawlessness, everyone, even a slave, has power over your life and death. Remember all those who had perished through homespun springes, or through apparent violence or guile. ...and invite others to support the offenders. I'd like to know the act which allows them to slaughter people like cattle. You shouldn't brood on it every evening. You are ruining yourself. Where's Jana? Why isn't she home already? She was studying and then she went out for a walk with Vlasta Stejskalova. - They're worried about the exams. - Doctor! There are soldiers in our street! They're entering the houses! Quick! Make fire in the stove! Burn it! Burn it. This too! Burn everything. They're gone. They left us out. - Don't say a word to anyone, Bozena. - I won't, madam. Where's Jana? That's the limit! Halt! Your passport! - Name? - Vlastimil Rysanek. - Born? - On February 15, 1923 in Kostelec. - Name? - Jana Skalova. - Occupation? - A student. Go! Jana! Where were you? We were translating Tacitus with Vlasta. Remember for next time, Mr. Rysanek, that I do not wish such rendezvous. - Daddy, we didn't know that... - Go home! You'll begin tomorrow. Arrest a few workers, farmers and someone from the educated class. - Yes, Obersturmführer. And what about those school leavers and their class tableau? Should we arrest the shopkeeper, three students, a teacher, and the headmaster? Nonsense! They're not political. The whole action shall be executed here in Kostelec. - As well as the liquidation. - Yes, sir. I already have the firing squad. I'll order coffins. Be sure not to cause any agitation. Have them made in a nearby village. Yes, sir. Quiet. Turn it off. - Open the door! - Tune it to Prague! Are you the joiner and owner of this workshop? - Yes. - Yes, that's my father. - What can we do for you? - I have an urgent order. Based on the directive of the Supreme Regional Council. It's of high importance! An urgent order based on the directive of the Supreme Regional Council. But I have no material. - What does he say? - My father has no material. Geheime Staatspolizei. Die deutschen Armeen bringen der Bevölkerung, kein Elend und kein Unglück, sondern Ordnung und Sicherheit. The German armies do not bring poverty and misfortune to people, but order and security. They teach you stupid things. When I was in the 8th form, we read Goethe and Heine. - Keep your thoughts to yourself! If they want it, he must learn it. Now I forgot everything because of you! - I don't care if I fail, I hate it! - Do you think I enjoy German? Father means well, Frantisek. Wherever you go today, you need to speak German. At the post office, at the revenue office, at the railway. - Even policemen take exams. - It won't be any good after the war. Stop worrying about what will be after the war and make sure you graduate! We can't sustain you forever. - Doesn't he look funny? - Give it to me, they're laughing at you. - They can go hang. - Go, else you'll be late. I'll ask Mr. Skala to take you to his office after you graduate. Where did you get such a silly idea? What would I do in a law firm? - Only until the war is over. - The Exchange wouldn't leave me there. And you have to wash their laundry. I don't want favors from anyone. And tell them to give you at least a hundred crowns. - Do you know where Vlasta is? - I don't. Sit down. Hand out the essay sheets, Skalova. Excuse me, sir, I had to... Rysanek. Lingua latina eminenter, disciplina non sufficienter. Sit in the second row. Dear students, we are commencing with this year's graduation essays under somewhat extraordinary circumstances. I do not have to remind you... There's no need to worry, sir. My 8th form will not disappoint you. The topics set by the Regional School Council. - There, my dear colleague. - Yes. There. Cremutius Cordus. - That's a disaster. - I wish you luck, students. Students, I hope the higher principle of morality shall not allow you to behave in such an infamous manner as to copy from your neighbors. That's a different paragraph. I'll send it to you. National Politics How did it go in Prague, Vaclav? They arrested my son and no one knows why. My daughter-in-law broke down and she is in hospital now. It's dreadful what's happening now. - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Who is the headmaster of this school? You? Yes, I am the headmaster. What can I do for you? We want to talk to you alone. You're not writing a concept, Rysanek? Just a moment, please. Remain seated. Havelka. Moucka. And Rysanek. Come with me. Now. But we are writing the graduation essay, sir. I know... Come with me, please. Leave everything here and come with me. Moucka, Havelka, and the third one - Rysanek. - Very well. We are writing our graduation essay in Latin, gentlemen. What do you want? Without their essays they shall not be allowed to take the graduation exams. Shut up, man! Or do you want to come with us? - Let's go! - Move it! Hurry up! - Get inside! - Inside! Your fellow students were arrested. It is an absurd misunderstanding. My 8th form students. I objected. Without success. Yet, this matter must be cleared up. Why no moral principle allows... Despite all evil, students, we must continue in our work. I have invited you as the senior members of the staff to jointly consult upon what we are to do in this misery. - Who knows what they were up to! - Nonsense. It must be because of their class tableau. We are all responsible for this and we shall bear the consequences. - They didn't ask about the tableau. - They must have blurted out something. They often let their tongue loose in class. - Not in my lessons, colleague. - In Czech Lessons, they do. In poetry, every single word reminds them of something. Such things do not belong in textbooks! It is not so long ago, Mr. Richter, when I used to write poems to commemorate the Independence Day! - I insist on your not saying such invectives! - Gentlemen, please! I thought we would consult upon the matter. But it is difficult to do anything until we know the cause. Go back to your classes now. And keep it back from the students. Just a moment, please. Mr. Vondracek, kindly supervise the 8th form now. Jana! Give it to me, Skalova. We must search their bags. Come and sit in the third row, Horak. And Skalova to the second! I'll teach you a lesson! - Did you find anything? - Nothing. Stop gaping and write, Stejskalova! Nothing. Give it to me. - Excuse me, sir. - Are you finished? Yes. It's 10.30. - You may go. - Goodbye, sir. Horak! Come here! - You didn't finish your essay. - I have to go. Do you have a hand in it too? - Tell me what happened? - I have no idea, sir. - You needn't be afraid of me. - I'm not. Do you have enough money? Say nothing. It's not me I'm worried about, but I have three children. I'm really not involved in anything, sir. I'll just let their parents know so that they are prepared when they come to search their homes. - And what if they catch you? No, I forbid you to do this. You have no right to do that, sir. Excuse me, do you know where Mrs. Rysankova is? She went out. Can I give her a message? No, thank you, I'll come back. Skalova! Finish the essay for him. I believe the matter is settled, Mr. Havelka. I've terminated my trading license, and I'm acceding to an office. The Protectorate laws shall not apply to me from now on. Look, Mr. Zajicek, you still are a citizen of the Protectorate. You will either pay the fine, or your shop shall be sold by auction. Come in. Could I speak to you for a moment, Mr. Havelka? I'm busy right now. It's very important, sir. Go on, Mr. Havelka, I can wait. Is there something the matter, Mr. Havelka? With the family? Well, I will not trouble you now. Wait, Mr. Zajicek. My son has been arrested by the Gestapo this morning. By the Gestapo? That's quite awkward nowadays. You have certain contacts. Could you find out why they arrested him? It won't be easy. Maybe if... Unofficially of course. And as to your matter, I shall put it in order myself. You can rely on me. They didn't even want it skived. What a shoddy job! It won't be for the Wehrmacht. It seems they need to hide the property confiscated from the Jews. I'll take shorter nails to make sure it falls apart quick. Good day. Is Mr. Moucka in? What are you doing here? Is anything wrong? Go home, please. As the Headmaster, you have the right to inquire at the Gestapo. Their graduation is at stake. Without the essays, it would be abhorrent to the regulations. We have been teaching together for twenty years, Mr. Malek. I respect you as a teacher and I am fond of you as man. Yet what you propose is childish! - Even the worst legal order in the world allows... - Do you read the papers? Do you know what's going on? No legal order exists any more! They too must have minimal moral principles in the least. When Brutus had laid his hands on Caesar, that too was an assassination. Albeit, Antonius was no moralist. Have all finished their essays? They copied it from each other. But that is deception. How am I to mark such essays? You can report me to the Regional School Council. That is very bitter. Particularly from you. My students still know nothing. The whole 8th form is standing in front of the staff room, soon the whole school will know. - Send them home. What's all this? Leave at once and take the shortest way home. Do you have any news, sir? Don't ask, Skalova. - Hullo? - Gestapo. - Are you the headmaster? - Yes, this is the headmaster speaking. Notify the parents of the arrested students in an appropriate manner. - You shall receive an official report in a few days. - Yes, sir. The whole teaching staff is liable for this matter. We are to notify the parents in an appropriate manner. "In a few days" he said, we shall receive a report. The whole teaching staff is liable. Hello, Doctor Skala! Are you going to Kostelec? - Good day, Obersturmführer. - Come, I'll give you a lift. You are most kind, sir, but I will not trouble you. You do not wish to go with a Gestapo officer? - Not at all. - Are you afraid of us then? Climb aboard. Where did you learn to speak Czech so well, sir? I studied in Vienna for many years. And I always had a liking for the Czechs. In that case, we're lucky to have you in Kostelec. I'd like to know what you Czechs think of us. But be frank! Well... He doesn't understand a word. Kostelec is a quiet and loyal town. Except for that awkward affair with the class tableau yesterday. It was just unfortunate coincidence. You must understand. Our people are most sensitive these days. Your students needn't be afraid though. We shall be mainly after persons of consequence. - Do you understand? - I do. - What's the matter? - Everything is in order. - Just a suspicious student. - Does he have a passport? Yes, sir! We caught him in the woods, off the road and with this bike. - Let him go. - Yes, sir! Alright. Be off! - Don't look for a cigarette, be my guest. - Thank you. Why did you hide? It's not bad at all to hide when things are getting hot. You should abide by it. Stop here! This is where you get off, Doctor Skala. - I do not wish to compromise you. - Thank you. You are most kind, sir. And in case you yourself need anything, come to me. Excuse me, does Mrs. Rysankova live here? - It's the last door on the gallery. - I see, thank you. - Good day. - Good day. I am your son's form master. Professor Malek. What happened? - Did Vlasta do something foolish? - No, on the contrary. Your son is an excellent student. Shall we go inside, Mrs. Rysankova. Of course, do come in, sir. Such a visit and the flat is in a terrible mess. Do sit down, sir. I brought this... Good Lord! What happened? - Was he run over by a car? - No, Mrs. Rysankova. Your son has been arrested by the Gestapo this morning. By the Gestapo? Why? No one knows why. They arrested three boys. Moucka and Havelka. Don't you have the slightest idea why? No... I have no idea. They were friends. They surely didn't do anything wrong. But a single word is enough today for them to shoot people. Do not be in despair, Mrs. Rysankova. Nothing is lost yet. You thought I was doing him wrong yesterday, while he is in something. It's must be because of our tableau, Daddy. Nonsense, it's not the tableau. I'm quite certain about that. How come? I am a lawyer, aren't I? I want to hear facts, my dear. Did they interrogate anyone else? Teachers, classmates or other students? No, they came and took them away. They told nothing to anyone. What was between you and Rysanek? Don't tell me that you were only translating Tacitus! - Any leaflets? - No. Tell me the truth, Jana! There's still time for me to do a lot. - Nothing. I swear, Daddy. - Stop nagging her, dear. She wouldn't lie to her parents. - Who is it? - It's Vlasta Stejskalova with Jan Horak. What do they want? Did Vlasta tell you something? Not even when you were alone? Didn't he confide in you? Was he and Karel in some group? I don't know. We were honestly just translating Tacitus. Don't cry. They'll let him go. Mr. Principle is coming with Vlasta's mother. Wait here. - I'm not in for anyone! - It's Jana's form master. - I can't expose myself. - Jana is downstairs. - She's bringing them here. - Damned girl. Wait! Tell him to come in and she can wait in the anteroom. Professor Malek is here, Daddy. - Good day, sir. - Welcome, Professor Malek. - Come in, Mrs. Rysankova. - Good day, sir. - Come, Jana. - Wait, Mummy. I would not bother you, sir, but this seems to be the worst day in my and Mrs. Rysankova's life. Oh yes, my daughter told me what happened. Unfortunately, I do not know the details. My son surely didn't do anything wrong, sir. As a lawyer, I am ready to provide advice. Leave us alone, Jana, will you? Do sit down, sir. Let us be concrete now. - Vlasta! - Wait. You were saying that you were not informed of the reasons for the arrest. - Can your father do anything? - He doesn't know what's it about. - But he'll surely do what he can. - You must ask him. If I summarize everything, the bags were left behind, no teachers or students were interrogated. There were no house searches. I wouldn't see it so tragically. What would you advise us to do, sir? I would definitely wait and not make a bigger affair of it. Nevertheless, I would like to ask you to inquire at the Gestapo today. At the Gestapo? Me? As a barrister, I have no access to the Gestapo, Professor Malek. I can go to the court, even the High Court... But they're shooting so many people every day. - All for naught. - These are absolutely different crimes. Were they were hiding weapons? Or enemies of the Reich? They weren't. You see? Their case is not subject to martial law. I think it's mere pettifoggery. Like the tableau. The Germans are rather edgy nowadays. This won't even get to the court room. However, if it does, I shall defend them vigorously. I can promise that, Professor Malek. But what if they do something to them without a trial? Doesn't your father know somebody at the Gestapo by chance? Of course not! Who could he know there? He must go to the court as a barrister. But my father never had anything to do with the Gestapo. Jana... I've seen your father today. I saw him in the Mercedes of the Gestapo chief. How can you say such a thing! I honestly did. I was on my way from Mr. Moucka and the patrol stopped me on the road. The Gestapo car appeared then. I was three steps away. Your father was hiding from me. Who knows what you saw. Next time, don't bring anyone here unless I allow you to do so. What would you do if they arrested me today? What a silly idea! You said you could still do a lot. Then why don't you want to do anything for the boys? Do you realize what's happening nowadays? How could you comfort Mrs. Rysankova by telling her you would defend her son? Mind your own business! In whose car were you riding from Pardubice today? Is this supposed to be an interrogation or what? Jan Horak saw you at the road check. In that case, don't tell anyone. He asked me to join him. What else could I do? If you know him, Daddy, couldn't you call on him? - Are you insane? He's the Gestapo chief! Should I get myself into trouble because of some silly fools? Daddy. Don't cry, dear. I'll think it over and we'll do something about it tomorrow. Tomorrow may be too late. Go to him now, please. - Is it twelve people today. - Yes, twelve. The execution will take place tonight at 6.30, here in the barrack yard. - Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. Daddy! What are you doing here? Go to him, Daddy. Please. Try to understand, dear, that I will not help them and only ruin us. - Our whole family. - Daddy. I won't get mixed up in this. They'll be after us now. Persons of consequence. - Let's go home. - Let go of me! Coward! - How many more are there? - Three more. Three... Send in those three! Oh, students! Your names? Vlastimil Rysanek. - Date of birth? - February 15, 1923. In German! You are all students, you all must speak German! February 15, 1923 in Kostelec. Next. Karel Moucka, born on April 4, 1923 in Milcin. Next. Havelka Franz, born on June 26, 1900... - When? - 1923 in Kostelec. Material. Is it familiar? Well? No. I'm innocent. I did it, they have nothing to do with it. - Speak in German! - I did it myself. - My friends are innocent. - It does not matter. You are the enemy of the people. The other two knew about it and were to report it. You failed to do so, whereby you have approved the assassination. You are sentenced to death. The execution will take place tonight at 6.30! Dismissed! - Move it! - What does "Hinrichtung" mean? Come in. Oh, it's Skalova. Do come in. Did your father find out something? What happened? My father deceived you, sir. I begged him to go to him, to do something. But he didn't go. Where? Where was he to go? He knows the Gestapo chief. He told me himself. But he didn't go to him and he lied to me. Don't cry. Don't cry, Skalova. Sometimes, fear may break even the greatest of men. What if I try myself? Here it is, sir. It's definitely this house. Could I speak to Mr. Worlitzek? You can speak Czech with me. Are you Mr. Worlitzek? You do not know me? I see, you're not local, are you? I have been living in this town for twenty years. I am Professor Malek, a classical philologist at the local grammar school. Oh, a classical philologist. Menin aeide, thea, Peleiadeo Achileos oulomenen, he muri' Achaiois alge' etheke. Iliad. Is it correct? You also... You also are a classical philologist? I am the chief of the local Secret State Police. Geheime Staatspolizei. Gestapo. Have you never heard of it? Do come in, please. Come, Trudi, this is the only man in town, who doesn't know me. A classical philologist. Sit down and have a cup of coffee, professor. This way. Would you like a cup of coffee or cocoa? - With cream? - Thank you. Come and have coffee with us, Gunther! You truly did not know me, professor? I did not. Do you have some troubles in your family? No, I live on my own. But my students. - From the 8th form. - Tell me what happened. This morning, when my 8th form students were writing their essays the Gestapo arrested three... - Daddy, Daddy! - Look a goldfish! - Yes, it is a goldfish. But you know you mustn't torture animals, don't you? Put it back in water. Go! What were you saying, professor? That the Gestapo arrested three students in my 8th form this morning. And what did they do? We do not know. No one informed us. We certainly will know. And you want me to let them go? They surely did not commit any crime. I kindly ask you to be indulgent towards the boys. Indulgent? It is a rather uncommon word in this war. Yet you, my dear professor, still live in the Trojan War, don't you? I plead for the boys. In my school days, I was a boy scout in Vienna. And they taught us to do a good turn every day. And I shall do one good turn today. For you. Get on, man, hurry up! Quick! Have three students been arrested today? Yes, sir. Give me their file. - Here it is, sir. - Thank you. Put the file under the rest. I'll go through it in the morning. We shall not give it to Wolf for the time being. But he already closed their case. - The students have been taken away already. - Were they? I need one more signature, sir. What? Why should we pay 3,000 crowns! For what? A bonus for the informer who turned in the students. Nonsense. Not for such silly thing! Everybody out! Quick! The three students will go last! Next! Move it! Into the garage! Quick! Quick! Move it, man! He's coming. Wait here, Skalova. The matter is settled, professor. Thank you. He said the matter was settled. It is good we have come here, Skalova. Please be so kind and call on Mrs. Rysankova today. And tell her everything so that her night is more peaceful. I will, sir. My parents will only find out from the radio. Guys... guys... guys. I didn't do anything. Tell them. They don't care! Franta, Karel, forgive me. I know... it is all my fault. Vlasta, you always were a fine guy. I always liked you. Even now. Guys... tell them, please. Hurry up! - Move it! Move it! - Do something, guys! Don't cry, Franta! We won't make those swines happy! Havelka Franz, a student. Rysanek Vlastimil, a student. Moucka Karel, a student. Based on the judgment of the Court Martial you are sentenced to death! You shall die by firing squad. My dad made these coffins. Firing squad, attention! Aim! Fire! He said the matter was settled. It was an appalling moment. As long as you have succeeded, sir. Vlastimil Rysanek... I have been teaching for thirty-five years yet this is the best student I ever had. Look at how he translated Tacitus. Without a single mistake as usual. And how he understood the author. It is a pity he didn't finish his essay. Will you have dinner, sir? Based on the judgment of the Court Martial of June 5, 1942, the following were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad: David Jaroslav, born on September 25, 1893 in Dvur Kralove, Sramek Jan, born on April 5, 1902 in Kostelec, Havelka Frantisek, a student, born on April 4, 1923 in Kostelec, Rysanek Vlastimil, a student, born on February 15, 1923 in Kostelec, - Moucka Karel, a student... - Did you hear it, sir? ...born on June 26, 1923 in Milcin... And I trusted him. Murderers. Murderers! How dreadful! Poor Mrs. Rysankova. Is Mrs. Rysankova home? - What is it, Miss Skalova? - Mrs. Rysankova, Professor Malek was at the Gestapo. Everything is alright. - There's no need to worry. - Really? - And when will they let them go? - I don't know. - Maybe today. - What are you telling her? We've just heard... What happened? What happened? - Tell me. - They shot... They shot Vlasta. - Oh my God! - Mrs. Rysankova. Go after her. - Mrs. Rysankova! - Based on the judgment of the Court Martial of June 5, 1942, the following were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad: Mrs. Rysankova! Mrs. Rysankova! - Where are you going? - Let go of me! Rysanek Vlastimil, a student. The judgment has been executed today. Those who breach this prohibition and appear in the street will be shot. Those hiding the assassins or persons involved in the assassination will be shot along with their family. Those who fail to lodge information will be shot. Open the gate! Open the gate! Give me back my child! - Get back! - Let go of me! Give me back my child. Give me back my child! Get back! Get back! - Murderers! - Get back! Murderers! It is all because of that rebel talk of yours! They'll shoot us all like in Tabor! Colleagues, I deem as necessary to immediately send a declaration of loyalty to the State Secretary, K. H. Frank, and to Minister Moravec. I would like to ask you, my dear colleague as the senior member of the staff, to be the first to sign. With a genuine feeling of respect and devotion to the Reich and the Fuhrer, the teaching staff of the Grammar School in Kostelec hereby condemns with utter exasperation the disgraceful act of the three students of our institution. I am an old man. And I shall not live the rest of my life in shame. - I will read it myself. - There is no need. In that case, it is necessary to address the 8th form students with a speech, condemning the perverted act of their fellow students, which will be recorded in the class book. But who should do that? The form master of course. Professor Malek... I rely on you and trust you shall do so in a tactful and prudent manner. And please, kindly leave your higher principles out. I know what I must do. Students, the teaching staff of our grammar school has resolved and has entrusted me... ...with rectifying the dreadful event of yesterday. Your fellow students were shot yesterday for approving the assassination. In terms of a higher moral principle, the murder of a tyrant is not deemed a crime. And I protest as any honest man must protest. I protest against the murder of your friends. May their innocent and pure blood fall upon the heads of their murderers!
