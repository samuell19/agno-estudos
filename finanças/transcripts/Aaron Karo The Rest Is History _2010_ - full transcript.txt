[hard rock riff] [Pachelbel's Canon In D Major] [hard rock music] - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AARON KARO! [cheers and applause] - JUST THE LADIES! JUST THE LADIES! JUST THE LADIES! [cheers and applause] JUST THE SINGLE LADIES! JUST THE SINGLE LADIES! [cheers and applause] JUST THE MARRIED LADIES! YOU'RE THE MARRIED LADIES! [cheers and applause] NONE OF YOU TALK TO ME AFTER THE SHOW. OKAY. KEEPING TRACK. SO I'M SO PUMPED TO BE HERE IN BOSTON! [cheers and applause] HOME OF MY ROWDIEST FANS IN THE COUNTRY. [cheers] AND I WANT TO JUST START BY SAYING ONE THING... HOW 'BOUT THOSE YANKEES? [cheers, applause, and catcalls] TOO SOON? I'M JUST MESSING WITH YOU, BOSTON. COME ON. UH, IT'S BEEN A CRAZY YEAR. I TURNED 30. FUCK ME. FUCKING 30, MAN. SOME DAYS I'M, LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M 30. LIFE'S PRETTY GOOD. I'M PRETTY HAPPY." AND OTHER DAYS I'M, LIKE, "OH, GOD, I'M 30. "I'VE DONE NOTHING WITH MY LIFE. I STILL USE MY COLLEGE ID TO GET A DOLLAR OFF FROM SUBWAY." PLUS, ALL MY FUCKING FRIENDS ARE GETTING MARRIED NOW. SERIOUSLY, MY TYPICAL WEEK IS FRIDAY: REHEARSAL DINNER, SATURDAY: WEDDING, SUNDAY: HANGOVER, MONDAY: SHAME, TUESDAY: UN-TAG PHOTOS. [laughter] REPEAT AS NECESSARY. AND CAN I JUST SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT BRIDESMAIDS SHOULD EVER BE ALLOWED TO MAKE SPEECHES? THEY'RE NEVER GOOD. I HATE WHEN THEY TELL "THE STORY" OF HOW THE BRIDE AND GROOM MET. IT'S ALWAYS, LIKE, "I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE "TO CELEBRATE RACHEL AND SCOTT. "RACHEL AND SCOTT MET IN THE PARK. THEIR FIRST DATE WAS BOWLING AND THE REST IS HISTORY." BULLSHIT. THERE'S NO WAY THAT'S HOW THEY ACTUALLY MET. "THE REST IS HISTORY." COME ON! I MAY HAVE HAD 12 BEERS AND TRIED TO KISS THE BRIDE'S MOM, BUT I'M NOT AN IDIOT. [laughter] BUT WHENEVER I START TO FEEL DOWN ABOUT BEING 30 OR ABOUT ALL MY FRIENDS GETTING MARRIED, THE ONE THING THAT KEEPS ME GOING IS LOGGING ONTO FACEBOOK AND REALIZING THAT EVERYONE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL WITH WHO WAS COOLER THAN ME, MORE POPULAR THAN ME, OR BETTER LOOKING THAN ME ARE NOW NONE OF THOSE THINGS. [laughter] HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THE MOST POPULAR KIDS FROM YOUR HIGH SCHOOL RECENTLY? THEY LOOK FUCKING HORRIBLE. AND IT'S AWESOME. [cheers and applause] AH. NOW, WHENEVER SOMEONE SAYS TO ME "I DON'T HAVE TO DRINK TO HAVE A GOOD TIME," MY RESPONSE IS ALWAYS "WELL, I DO." [laughter] [scattered cheers] I MEAN, YOU GUYS EVER GO OUT WITH SOME OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD-- PEOPLE WHO YOU'VE SHARED SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS OF YOUR LIFE WITH, BUT THEY'RE DRINKING AND YOU AREN'T? IT'S NOT FUN AT ALL. AND I TRY TO PRETEND LIKE I'M HAVING A GREAT TIME. BUT SECRETLY, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET HOME, PUT SWEAT PANTS ON, AND JUST WATCH THE SHIT OUT OF MY DVR. MY WASTED BUDDIES ALWAYS ROLL UP TO ME, PUT THEIR ARM AROUND ME, AND THEY YELL "KARO! THIS IS GREATEST NIGHT EVER!" AND I TRY MY BEST TO FIT IN. BUT ALL I WANT TO DO IS WATCH AN EPISODE OF "LOST," BEAT OFF, AND GO TO SLEEP. [laughter] I ALSO BELIEVE THAT BEING WITH YOUR BUDDIES WHEN THEY'RE FUCKED UP AND YOU AREN'T IS ACTUALLY QUITE EYE-OPENING. I LOOK AROUND AT MY BOYS, LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE. "THESE GUYS ARE ALL DOUCHE BAGS. GOOD THING I'M NOT LIKE THAT WHEN I'M DRUNK." OF COURSE, EVERYONE'S GOT THAT ONE FRIEND WHO EVERY NIGHT GETS FUCKED UP, GETS IN A GUY'S FACE FOR NO REASON, AND IS SO OUT OF LINE THAT WHEN A FIGHT BREAKS OUT, I TAKE THE OTHER DUDE'S SIDE. AND WHEN THINGS CALM DOWN, I END UP BEING CHOSEN AS THE EMISSARY WHO HAS TO GO OVER TO THE OTHER GROUP OF GUYS AND APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF MY STUPID FUCKING FRIEND. AND I'M, LIKE, "LISTEN, MAN, I'M REALLY SORRY. MY BUDDY'S WASTED. HE'S BEING AN ASSHOLE." AND THE GUY'S, LIKE, "IT'S ALL GOOD, BRO. NO WORRIES." AND I ALWAYS HAVE THE SAME THOUGHT: THESE GUYS ARE COOLER THAN MY FRIENDS! [laughter] AT LEAST THESE GUYS ARE WITH CHICKS. MY BUDDIES ARE OVER THERE PLAYING "BUCK HUNTER" AND JERKING EACH OTHER OFF. I ALSO THINK THAT FLYING IN TO VISIT YOUR BUDDIES IN ANOTHER CITY, BUT FLYING IN ON THURSDAY INSTEAD OF FRIDAY, YOU KNOW, SO YOU GET THE LONG WEEKEND IN, NEVER A GOOD IDEA. BECAUSE EVERY TIME I SPEND 72 HOURS DRINKING WITH FRIENDS I HAVEN'T SEEN IN A WHILE, SOME SHIT GOES DOWN. THE FIRST NIGHT YOU GET IN, "WHAT'S UP, DUDE? LONG TIME, NO SEE. LET'S GET FUCKED UP." IT'S AWESOME. THE SECOND NIGHT, IT'S FRIDAY. IT'S THE WEEKEND. "LET'S GET FUCKED UP." IT'S AWESOME. THE THIRD NIGHT, I LOSE MY CELL PHONE. MY FRIEND PUNCHES A SEVEN-FOOT BOUNCER IN THE BALLS. CHICKS ARE CRYING. PEOPLE GET ARRESTED. A SMALL FIRE BREAKS OUT. SOMEONE GOES INTO LABOR. [laughter] AND I END UP VOMITING HALF IN MY FRIEND'S TOILET AND HALF ON THE SIDE OF HIS BATHTUB. IT'S ALWAYS IN THAT LITTLE SPACE YOU CAN'T EVEN GET TO TO CLEAN UP, RIGHT? WHY DO THEY EVEN MAKE THE SPACE BETWEEN THE BATHTUB AND THE TOILET LIKE THAT? WHAT KIND OF CLEANING DEVICE CAN GET VOMIT OUT OF A SPACE LIKE THAT? I USUALLY JUST, LIKE, MOVE THE GARBAGE CAN IN FRONT OF IT, LIKE, "GOTTA CATCH A FLIGHT. PEACE." STILL BEING AT THE BAR WHEN IT CLOSES, BADGE OF HONOR. BUT NOTHING WILL MAKE YOU QUESTION YOUR LIFE CHOICES MORE THAN GETTING TO THE BAR BEFORE IT EVEN OPENS. I'M, LIKE, "LET ME IN! IT'S 9:55! A.M.!" SOMETIMES I GET SO DRUNK THAT WHEN I BRING THE SHIRT THAT I WORE TO THE BAR TO THE DRY CLEANER AND THEY ASK ME WHAT THE STAIN IS, I CAN'T EVEN IDENTIFY IT. I'M, LIKE, "OH, IT'S EITHER VODKA CRANBERRY, OR BLOOD." MY BUDDY CLAUDIO ONCE GOT SO DRUNK THAT HE SLEPT WITH A GIRL AND THE NEXT DAY SHE WAS GONE AND HE COULDN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED. AND HE FINDS THIS ONE FLIP-FLOP THAT SHE MUST'VE SOMEHOW LEFT UNDERNEATH HIS BED. AND WE'RE STARING AT IT. I'M, LIKE, "DUDE, WHO LEAVES BEHIND ONE SHOE? I THINK YOU MIGHT'VE FUCKED CINDERELLA." [laughter] YOU EVER KNOW SO FAR AHEAD OF TIME HOW DRUNK YOU'RE GONNA GET... [cheers and applause] THAT YOU CALL IN SICK FOR WORK THE NEXT DAY... BEFORE YOU EVEN GO OUT? YOU EVER GET TO A PARTY, LIKE, TWO HOURS LATE, EVERYONE'S ALREADY WASTED, SO YOU TOTALLY PANIC, OVERCOMPENSATE, START LAPPING PEOPLE, AND END UP GETTING TWICE AS FUCKED UP AS ANYONE ELSE? EVER AGREE TO TAKE A SHOT AND THEN IMMEDIATELY REGRET NOT ASKING WHAT'S IN IT FIRST? [laughter and applause] MY BUDDY'S, LIKE, "YO, KARO, YOU WANT TO TAKE A, UH, A FLAMING BAY OF PIGS INVASION?" "FUCK, YEAH, DUDE. WHATEVER. LINE 'EM UP." NEXT THING YOU KNOW THE BARTENDER PUTS GOGGLES ON. HE'S BURNING SUGAR ON A SPOON. HE'S GOT SIX DIFFERENT-SIZED GLASSES LIKE A RUSSIAN NESTING DOLL. SOMEONE BANGS A GONG. A CROWD GATHERS. THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER FROM THE LOCAL PAPER THERE. I'M, LIKE, "WHAT THE FUCK DID I GET MYSELF INTO?" WHERE DID THAT GONG COME FROM? THE WORST THOUGH IS WHEN I'M AT THE BAR AND I TAKE THAT ONE EXTRA, TOTALLY UNNECESSARY SHOT. BECAUSE I END UP HAVING TO GIVE MYSELF A PEP TALK. MY INNER MONOLOGUE IS LIKE THIS... "THAT WAS A BAD IDEA. [laughter] "STARTING TO SALIVATE. [laughter] "DON'T PUKE. [laughter] "CHOKE IT BACK, KARO! CHOKE IT BACK! "OH, TRY NOT TO CRY. "FUCK. WHERE'S THE BATHROOM? "NO, KARO, IF YOU PUKE, "YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO START DRINKING ALL OVER AGAIN. "YOU HAVE SUCH A GREAT BASE GOING. [labored breathing] [cries] "OKAY. OKAY. OKAY. THINK IT PASSED. OKAY. ONE MORE SHOT." [laughter] I ALWAYS FEEL AWKWARD WHEN I'M HITTING ON A GIRL, BUT SHE'S DRINKING WINE. BECAUSE MOST WOMEN HOLD THE GLASS PROPERLY BY THE STEM. MEANWHILE, I'M CLUTCHING A BEER IN THE PALM OF MY HAND LIKE I'M THE ANCHOR LEG IN THE GREEK WEEK INTER-FRATERNITY BOAT RACE FINALS. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO BE SUAVE WHEN YOU'RE, LIKE, "YES, THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE CRISIS "IS QUITE TROUBLING. IS THAT CHARDONNAY?" GOOSH! THE HOTTER THE GIRL, THE HAPPIER I AM TO FIND OUT SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND BECAUSE NOW I HAVE AN EXCUSE TO TELL MY BUDDIES AT THE BAR WHY I GOT SHOT DOWN. I'M, LIKE, "I TRIED MY BEST, BUT GOSH DARN IT, "SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND. "HIS NAME IS TODD. "AND I'M NOT GONNA LIE, GUYS. I THINK HE'S THE ONE." [laughter] SOMETIMES I'LL BE AT THE BAR AND I'LL BE WATCHING ONE OF MY BOYS HIT ON A CHICK. BUT HE'S SO SLOPPY DRUNK THAT I ACTUALLY FEEL BAD FOR THE GIRL. NO ONE LIKES TO GIVE THEIR OWN FRIEND THE HOOK. BUT SOMETIMES, THEY HAVE TO BE, LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, DANNY, TIME TO PACK IT IN, BRO. "YOUR NIGHT'S OVER. "NO. LET GO OF THE NICE GIRL'S HAND. "NO, LET GO OF HER DRESS. "NO, DANNY, SHE DOESN'T WANT YOUR NUMBER, DUDE. "WHAT--BECAUSE SHE JUST SAID "'I DON'T WANT YOUR CRAZY FRIEND'S NUMBER. "GET HIM AWAY FROM ME.' "NO. DANNY, DON'T-- DON'T GIVE HER YOUR CELL PHONE. "YOU'RE NOT HELPING. "SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO BUY HER A DRINK, MAN. "NO. THAT'S NOT EVEN A CREDIT CARD. "THAT'S YOUR CVS CARD. [laughter] "THAT'S A--NO, THAT'S A COUPON FOR A FREE CAR WASH. "NO. NO. NO. NO. "BUT YOU CAN GET A DOLLAR OFF SUBWAY WITH THAT ONE. "LISTEN, DANNY, WILL YOU JUST LEAVE "THIS POOR GIRL ALONE? "DANNY, LOOK AT HER FUCKING HAND. "LOOK AT HER FINGER. YOU SEE THAT? "IT'S A WEDDING RING. YOU'VE GOT NO SHOT. "WHAT? NO, I--YES. FIN--THAT'S A FAIR-- "I AGREE--LISTEN, I AGREE THAT MARRIED PEOPLE "SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN BARS. [laughter] [cheers and applause] BUT, DANNY, NO, WE CAN'T KILL HER." SO MY, UH, SINGLE FEMALE FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS ASKING ME TO SET THEM UP. BUT IT'S SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS. LIKE, MY FRIEND JEN RECENTLY ASKED ME TO SET HER UP WITH ONE OF MY BUDDIES WHO SHE THOUGHT WAS CUTE. AND I WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, I'LL SHOOT HIM AN EMAIL. I'LL TALK YOU UP. AND I'LL HAVE HIM FRIEND YOU." AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OH, I DON'T HAVE FACEBOOK." AND I WAS LIKE, "OOH, I'M NOT SETTING YOU UP THEN." SHE'S, LIKE, "WHY NOT?" I'M, LIKE, "HOW'S HE SUPPOSED TO STALK YOU FIRST "IF YOU DON'T HAVE FACEBOOK? "HE NEEDS TO SEE SEVERAL PICTURES OF YOU "FROM MULTIPLE ANGLES "AND AT LEAST ONE PHOTO ALBUM FROM HALLOWEEN TO SEE HOW SLUTTY YOU DRESSED." [cheers and applause] SHE'S, LIKE, "WELL, I HAVE MYSPACE." "THAT'S NOT GONNA CUT IT UNLESS IT WAS 2006 OR YOU'RE FILIPINO." AM I RIGHT? THEN I WAS TALKING TO MY FRIEND DEB AND I WAS TELLING HER ABOUT ONE OF MY BUDDIES I THOUGHT SHE'D LIKE. YOU KNOW, I EXPECT HER TO ASK "WHAT DOES HE DO?" SHE GOES "DOES HE HAVE BLUE-GREEN EYES?" I WAS LIKE, "I'VE KNOWN THIS GUY FOR OVER 25 YEARS, "I DON'T FUCKING KNOW WHAT COLOR EYES HE HAS! I JUST FOUND OUT HIS REAL FIRST NAME LAST WEEK." DEB ALSO READS HER HOROSCOPE EVERY DAY. SHE'S, LIKE, "HE'S A LEO. I'M A SAGITTARIUS. IT'S PERFECT." NO GUY HAS EVER GOTTEN A RANDOM BLOWJOB AND THEN BEEN, LIKE, "OH, I GUESS OUR MOONS WERE ALIGNED. THOSE CAPRICORNS SUCK A MIGHTY FINE DICK." THE GIRLS HERE WHO READ THEIR HOROSCOPES ARE THINKING "MM-HMM, THAT'S TRUE. CAPRICORNS DO DO THAT." [laughter] SEE, I THINK THAT HOROSCOPES ARE LIKE SPAM. THEY'RE BOTH WRITTEN IN A WAY TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT APPLIES TO YOU. LIKE, YOU EVER READ YOUR HOROSCOPE AND YOU'RE, LIKE... "YEAH. I DO LIKE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS"? [laughter] "THANKS, FORTUNE COOKIE." I GET SPAM WITH THE SUBJECT "FUCK GIRLS IN YOUR AREA." PFFT. I GO TO DELETE IT. BUT THEN I SEE IT ALSO SAYS "DO YOU SOMETIMES JERK OFF WITH YOUR LEFT HAND JUST TO SWITCH THINGS UP A BIT?" "YEAH. "I DO DO THAT. [laughter] IT'S REAL-- IT'S A REAL WEB SITE. SEE, I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND THE POINT OF BEING SET UP. TO ME, A FIRST DATE IS SOMETHING I GO ON AFTER I'VE ALREADY HOOKED UP WITH A GIRL. EITHER 'CAUSE I FEEL BAD OR 'CAUSE I WANT TO GET LAID, BUT SHE ONLY BLEW ME THE FIRST TIME. SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CHOICE ON EHARMONY. [laughter] PLUS WHEN YOU GO OUT WITH A GIRL FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT'S NOT WHAT SHE REALLY LOOKS LIKE. FOR GUYS, WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. YOU KNOW, ALL I'VE GOT TONIGHT IS SOME GEL IN MY HAIR, SOME CHAPSTICK ON MY LIPS, AND SOME BABY POWDER ON MY BALLS, BUT THAT'S IT. [laughter] BUT GIRLS ARE GETTING A MANI AND A PEDI, AND THEIR HAIR DONE, AND MAKEUP, THEY'RE TAPING THEIR TITS TOGETHER. IT'S FUCKING HUMAN PHOTOSHOP. NOTHING FREAKS ME OUT MORE THAN WHEN A GIRL TAKES HER HEELS OFF MID-DATE TO SHOW ME HOW TALL SHE REALLY IS. SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE, "OH, THESE ARE JUST REALLY HIGH BOOTS." [laughter] [applause] "OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE A LITTLE PERSON." [laughter] "WHAT WERE YOU WEARING, STILTS?" SO I REFUSE TO GET SET UP. PLUS, I FOUND THAT FRIENDS WHO KNOW YOU BEST, ARE THE WORST AT SETTING YOU UP. PERFECT STRANGERS ARE SO MUCH BETTER AT IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T OVERTHINK THINGS. MY FRIENDS ARE, LIKE, "OH, I DON'T KNOW IF KARO WILL BE INTO THAT GIRL. HE LIKES BRUNETTES." YEAH, I PREFER BRUNETTES, BUT I'LL BANG A BLONDE. LET'S NOT GET PICKY. MY GUY FRIENDS ALSO DON'T GET VERY CREATIVE WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT GIRLS TO SET ME UP WITH. MY BUDDY SCOTT RECENTLY CALLED ME. HE'S, LIKE, "KARO, MAN, "YOU WANT ME TO INTRODUCE ME TO THIS CHICK, MICHELLE? SHE'S REAL CUTE." I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, SURE, HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?" "FUCKED HER." [laughter] THAT'S NOT REALLY THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX. LITERALLY. [laughter] [cheers and applause] AND THE THING IS THAT DIDN'T EVEN REALLY DETER ME. I WAS LIKE... "HOW LONG AGO DID YOU FUCK HER? "WAS IT RAW DOG? [audience moans] NO? MAKE THE CALL." MY, UH... [chuckles] MY OTHER BUDDY JEFF RECENTLY STARTED HOOKING UP WITH THIS NEW GIRL. AND FIRST OF ALL, HER NAME IS "BRENDA BROWN." I DON'T KNOW, I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S THE STUPIDEST NAME EVER. [laughter] BUT I GO TO HIM, I'M LIKE, "DOES SHE HAVE ANY FRIENDS?" AND HE'S, LIKE, "YEAH, ACTUALLY, I MET THIS GUY SHE WENT TO COLLEGE WITH." I WAS LIKE, "WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. "I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT HER ACTUAL FRIENDS. I MEAN, DOES SHE KNOW SLUTS?" LISTEN, JEFF, I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT BRENDA'S GIVING YOU BLOWJOBS ON THE REGULAR, BUT WHAT CAN BROWN DO FOR ME? [laughter] [applause] AND I HATE WHEN GIRLS TRY TO SET ME UP. BECAUSE HOW LONG A GIRL STRESSES THE WORD "SO" WHEN DESCRIBING HOW CUTE HER FRIEND IS IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO HOW CUTE HER FRIEND ACTUALLY IS. IF A GIRL'S, LIKE, "YOU HAVE TO MEET MY FRIEND JESSICA. SHE'S SOOOOOO CUTE," THAT CHICK IS BUSTED! [laughter] PRETTY SURE I JUST BLEW MY SHOULDER OUT. [laughter] WHEN I WAS 20, GET WASTED, FALL DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS, POP UP LIKE A CARTOON CHARACTER. NOW I'M, LIKE, "OY, I PUT TOO MUCH CHUTZPAH ON THAT LAST JOKE." OH, FUCK. BUT I REALLY HATE THE FACT THAT HOW LONG YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO HOW FAR IN ADVANCE YOU MAKE PLANS. YOU EVER TRY TO MAKE PLANS WITH ONE OF YOUR MARRIED FRIENDS? I'M, LIKE, "YO, DUDE, DO YOU WANT TO COME OVER, WATCH THE GAME?" "OOH, I CAN'T. BUT HOW ABOUT SIX WEEKS FROM TUESDAY?" MY PARENTS HAVE A CALENDAR IN THEIR KITCHEN THAT'S BOOKED THROUGH 2012. LIKE, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING? TRAINING FOR THE OLYMPICS? [laughter] AND THE THING IS, COUPLES NEVER EVEN MAKE INTERESTING PLANS. IF I MAKE PLANS SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE, IT'S 'CAUSE I'M GOING TO BARBADOS. MY MARRIED FRIENDS MAKE PLANS SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO BRUNCH. SINGLE PEOPLE AND PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS SHOULD ALSO NEVER GO AWAY ON VACATION TOGETHER. [cheers and applause] OUR INCENTIVES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. IF YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP AND YOU GO TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY, YOU WANT TO EXPLORE, IMMERSE YOURSELF IN THE CULTURE, EAT INTERESTING FOOD, WALK ALONG THE WATER. WHEN I GO TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY, I WANT TO SPEND SEVEN MINUTES AT EACH OF THE FIVE MOST FAMOUS LANDMARKS, TAKE THREE PICTURES, AND THEN GO FIND STRANGE PUSSY. [cheers and applause] OUR ITINERARIES WILL NEVER CROSS. WHEN PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS GO ON VACATION, THEY ALWAYS CHECK TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A GYM IN HOTEL. WHEN I GO AWAY, THE ONLY THING I EAT IS BACON. [laughter] I WILL ONLY MOVE AS FAR AS MY INFLATABLE RAFT WITH BUILT-IN CUP HOLDERS WILL FLOAT. "DO I WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO EAT? "WELL, THAT DEPENDS. "CAN IT BE DELIVERED DIRECTLY INTO MY MOUTH WHILE I REMAIN IN THE DEAD MAN'S POSITION?" I LOVE WHEN I GO AWAY AND THE WAITER'S, LIKE, "WELL, THAT COMES WITH A CHOICE OF SALAD FOR FRIES." [laughter] I'M NOT WEARING SHOES. I'M NOT WEARING A SHIRT. I'M DRINKING A BEER. IT'S 10:15 AM. FRY ME. WHEN PEOPLE ON RELATIONSHIPS GO ON VACATION, THEY ALWAYS BRING A LITTLE WORK WITH THEM. WHY ARE YOU SUCH A FUCKING BUZZKILL? EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET ANY WORK DONE WHEN YOU GO AWAY. YOU BRING THAT REPORT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO READ. BUT YOU NEVER DO ANYTHING WITH IT EXCEPT TRANSFER IT TO A SERIES OF SMALLER BAGS. IT GOES FROM YOUR SUITCASE TO YOUR BEACH BAG TO YOUR BACKPACK AND THEN DIRECTLY BACK INTO YOUR BRIEFCASE TO TAKE TO WORK ON MONDAY. EXCEPT NOW IT SMELLS LIKE SUNTAN LOTION AND SORROW. [laughter] WHEN PEOPLE IN RELATIONSHIPS GO ON VACATION, THEY ALWAYS TAKE THAT ONE PICTURE TAKEN FROM THEIR POINT OF VIEW, SITTING IN A BEACH CHAIR, LOOKING DOWN PAST THEIR FEET AT THE OCEAN. NEWSFLASH: NO ONE WANTS TO SEE A PICTURE OF YOUR FUCKING FEET! WHEN I GO AWAY, I WILL ONLY SHOW YOU PICTURES OF SOME CHICK'S TITS, SOME DUDE PUKING, OR A DONKEY. [laughter] [cheers and applause] HOPEFULLY ALL IN ONE SHOT. [laughter] I HAVE BEEN ALL AROUND THE WORLD WITH MY SINGLE FRIENDS. THE CHICKS IN BUENOS AIRES ARE GORGEOUS, BUT DEVIOUS. I'D BE, LIKE, ESTA SOLTERA? "ARE YOU SINGLE?" AND SHE'D BE, LIKE, SI, SI, SOLTERA. "YES, YES, I'M SINGLE." AND LATER, I TRY TO TAKE HER HOME. VAMANOS. "LET'S GO." [laughter] THAT'S JUST HOW YOU SAY "LET'S GO." [laughter] AND SHE WAS LIKE, NO, WHICH MEANS "NO." [laughter] AND I WAS LIKE, POR QUE? "WHY?" AND SHE'S LIKE, TENGO UN NOVIO. "I HAVE A BOYFRIEND." I'M, LIKE, "WHAT THE FUCK! "WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED TO SOLTERA? I THOUGHT YOU WERE SOLTERA." IT TURNS OUT THAT IN ARGENTINA, "SINGLE" MEANS "UNMARRIED." SO YOU CAN BE SINGLE BUT STILL HAVE A BOYFRIEND, WHICH SUCKS FOR ME. I GO TO MY BUDDIES, "I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE "I JUST BOUGHT A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE "FOR A CHICK WITH A FUCKING BOYFRIEND. "I'M SO FUCKING PISSED. THAT COST ME...$6." [laughter] THE CHICKS IN SYDNEY ARE INCREDIBLE. - WHOO! - BUT THE--THANKS, MAN. [laughter] CHICK FROM SYDNEY UP THERE IN THE BALCONY. THE CHICKS IN SYDNEY ARE INCREDIBLE. BUT THE PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA ARE WAY TOO NICE. YOU CAN'T GO TO THE BATHROOM IN A BAR IN SYDNEY 'CAUSE EVERY GUY'S LIKE, "YOU FIRST, MATE. NO, YOU FIRST, MATE. NO, YOU FIRST, MATE." "SOMEONE FUCKING GO OR I'M GONNA PISS MYSELF!" [laughter] SO I'LL BE TALKING TO THE HOTTEST, NICEST CHICK EVER. AND I'LL BE, LIKE, "SO, DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?" AND SHE'S, LIKE, "OH, ACTUALLY, I DO. LET ME INTRODUCE YOU." "NO, NO. I DON'T GIVE A FUCK. AAH." AND THE WORST PART WAS THAT I DID LOVE HIM. [laughter] SO NICE. AND SO TAN. 90% OF THE CHICKS IN TOKYO ARE THIN, HAVE PERFECT SKIN, DRESS WELL, AND ARE HOT. AND I LEARNED A LITTLE JAPANESE. SO IF I SAW A CUTE CHICK IN A BAR, I ROLL UP TO HER AND SAY [clears throat] [speaks Japanese] WHICH TRANSLATES ROUGHLY TO... 'SUP? [laughter] SERIOUSLY. [laughter] THE PROBLEM IS NOT ONLY ARE JAPANESE WOMEN NOT INTO ONE-NIGHT STANDS, THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S JUST NOT A PART OF THEIR CULTURE. BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS. SO IF I DID MEET A GIRL WHO SPOKE A LITTLE ENGLISH, I'D BE, LIKE, "WHY DON'T WE GO BACK TO MY HOTEL?" AND SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, I HAVE MY OWN PLACE." "ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE CAN GO TO YOUR PLACE." SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, WHY WOULD YOU COME WITH ME?" "WELL..." [laughter] "BE..." "'CAUSE, YOU KNOW..." BUT SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANTED. AND HOW DO YOU SAY "ONE-NIGHT STAND" IN CHARADES? I WAS LIKE, UM... [laughter] [cheers and applause] SHE GOT IT. [laughter] BACK IN NEW YORK, UH, ONE OF MY BUDDIES HAS BEEN HOOKING UP WITH HIS COWORKER. BUT THEIR COMPANY ACTUALLY HAS A VERY STRICT POLICY ABOUT DOCUMENTING INTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS. THIS IS A TRUE STORY. MY BUDDY ROLLS INTO HIS BOSS' OFFICE. AND IS LIKE, "HEY, YOU KNOW KATE FROM SALES? I'M BANGING HER." AND HIS BOSS WAS LIKE, "NICE." [laughter] 'CAUSE GUYS WILL ALWAYS AVOID DEFINING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN BOYFRIEND DUTIES WE ARE JUST NOT DOWN WITH. KILLING SPIDERS, UM, NO. I'M FUCKING TERRIFIED OF SPIDERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'LL BE IN THE NEXT ROOM SCREAMING LIKE A GIRL. [laughter] IN FACT, WHEN THERE ARE NO WOMEN AROUND, MY PREFERRED METHOD FOR KILLING SPIDERS IS THROWING THINGS AT THEM FROM A SAFE DISTANCE. DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO KILL A SPIDER FROM TEN FEET AWAY WITH A TISSUE BOX? THE WORST IS CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU GOT IT. NOTHING IS MORE TERRIFYING THAN VERIFYING PROOF OF LIFE ON A SPIDER. YOU TIPTOE UP TO IT LIKE IT'S GONNA HEAR YOU. "FUCKING COCKSUCKER. "SPIDER BASTARD. "HOLY SHIT, IT MOVED! HOLY FUCK! "WHAT THE--HOLY SHIT. OH, MY GOD. "I THINK IT'S A PIECE OF LINT. IT MIGHT BE A PIECE OF LINT. "JUST IN CASE, I'M JUST NEVER GOING TO GO INTO THAT PART "OF THE APARTMENT AGAIN. SEAL IT OFF." WHAT ELSE DO GIRLFRIENDS ASK ME? "COULD YOU PICK UP SOME TAMPONS?" "UGH, CAN'T YOU JUST ORDER THEM ONLINE?" [laughter] I HAD THIS ONE GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS OBSESSED WITH SELLING THINGS ON CRAIGSLIST. THE THING WAS, SHE'D GO TO WORK AND THEN MAKE ME WAIT AT HER PLACE FOR THE GUY WHO BOUGHT THE STUFF TO COME OVER AND PICK IT UP. SHE'D BE LIKE, "I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE WITH SOME RANDOM STRANGER." I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE WITH SOME RANDOM STRANGER! WHY IS MY LIFE WORTH ANY LESS THAN YOURS? BELIEVE ME, THAT DUDE TRIES TO KILL ME, I'M JUST GIVE HIM YOUR CD RACK. FUCK THAT. [laughter] THIS OTHER GIRL I DATED, IF I DIDN'T PROACTIVELY END THE CONVERSATION, SHE WOULD NEVER GET OFF THE PHONE WITH ME. IT WAS UP TO HER, SHE'D JUST TAKE ME ALONG WITH HER ALL DAY LIKE SOME SORT OF AUDIO-ONLY REALITY SHOW. [laughter] AND YELLING AT A GIRL JUST NEVER GETS ANYTHING ACCOMPLISHED. IT'S SO MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO FIGHT VIA TEXT MESSAGE. YOU'RE FORCED TO COOL DOWN A LITTLE BIT. YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR WORDS CAREFULLY SO THAT YOUR ARGUMENT DOESN'T GET CUT OFF. AND I CAN'T HELP BUT LAUGH WHEN A GIRL WRITES ME "KARO, GO DUCK YOURSELF." [laughter] YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU. IT'S OKAY. [laughter] NOW WE GOT IT. BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, LIKE I SAID, I AM 30 NOW SO I'VE REALIZED I DO NEED TO START TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS, WHICH INCLUDES PRACTICING SAFE SEX. - WHOO. - UH, YEAH. UM... [laughter] THIS ONE GIRL I'VE BEEN HOOKING UP WITH HAS BEEN OUT OF TOWN A LOT, SO WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN EXPERIMENTING WITH PHONE SEX. BUT IT'S KIND OF GOTTEN ME CONFUSED 'CAUSE SHE CALLS ME UP, LIKE, [whispers] "KARO... I WANT YOU TO FUCK ME RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW." AND I'M LIKE, "OKAY--UH-- "[whispers] OKAY. "UH, I'M KISSING YOUR NECK. "I'M STROKING THE INSIDE OF YOUR THIGH. "AND NOW I'M RUNNING ACROSS THE STREET TO BUY CONDOMS AT THE GAS STATION." [laughter] I NEVER KNOW HOW REALISTIC I'M SUPPOSED TO GET. [laughter] PHONE SEX ON A CELL PHONE IS THE WORST. I'M, LIKE, [whispers] "OH, YEAH. "DOES THAT FEEL GOOD? "HELLO? "[normal voice] HELLO? FUCK." CALL HER BACK. "HEY, WHAT JUST HAPPENED? "NO, I HAVE, LIKE, FOUR BARS. "NO, IT'S DEFINITELY NOT MY PHONE. "NO. WHAT WAS THE LAST THING YOU HEARD ME SAY? "'I LOVE YOUR ASS'? "THAT WAS, LIKE, FIVE MINUTES AGO. "SO BASICALLY I'VE BEEN TALKING DIRTY TO MYSELF AND MASTURBATING." [laughter] AND WHEN THINGS GET, LIKE, REALLY INTENSE ON THE PHONE-- YOU GUYS ALL RIGHT? JESUS. HOW MUCH PHONE SEX DO YOU GUYS HAVE? [laughter] BUT, UH, SOMETIMES WHEN THINGS GET REALLY INTENSE ON THE PHONE, I FIND MYSELF HAVING TROUBLE-- DO THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE HAVE TO PISS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SHOW? THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF THING. I MEAN, SERIOUSLY. LIKE, LET'S PICK THE PEOPLE WITH THE SMALLEST BLADDER, AND THEN SIT THEM DEAD CENTER IN FRONT OF ALL FIVE CAMERAS AND MY EYELINE. IT WORKS. BOO. [cheers and applause] [sighs] IT'S ALWAYS THE COUPLES. DON'T THEY JUST FUCK UP YOUR WHOLE LIFE SOMETIMES? [cheers and applause] THEY'RE IN THE WAY. IN THE STREET. IN LINE. YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THEM TALK ON THE TRAIN AND WHINE-- THEY'RE ALWAYS CRYING. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO ORDER. THEY'RE SLOW. THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ON AN AIRPLANE BEFORE. SHE'S WEARING UGGS ALL THE TIME. [laughter] SHE DOESN'T TELL HIM THAT A POPPED COLLAR IS DOUCHE BAGGY. [laughter] HA HA HA. OH, ALL RIGHT. SO THEN WHAT WAS I TALKING ABOUT? OH, THE PHONE SEX. THOSE HORNDOGS OVER THERE. RIGHT. SOMETIMES WHEN THINGS GET REALLY INTENSE ON THE PHONE, I FIND MYSELF KIND OF UNABLE TO KEEP THINGS STRAIGHT IN MY HEAD. LIKE, I'LL BE, LIKE, "[whispers] OH, YEAH. "YEAH, YOU LIKE THAT? YEAH? FEEL GOOD? YEAH? "YEAH, I WANT YOUR COCK IN MY PUSSY. "[normal voice] WAIT, WAIT. [laughter] "FUCK. SHIT. "DAMN IT. FUCK." NOW, GUYS, GUYS, I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU SLEEP WITH A WOMAN, SHE HAS AN ORGASM, ALL RIGHT? [cheers and applause] [man boos] [laughter] BECAUSE FUCKING CHICKS IS A REFERRAL BUSINESS. [laughter] YOU MAKE A GIRL COME. SHE TELLS TEN FRIENDS. THAT'S EXCELLENT WORD OF MOUTH. [laughter] NOW, LADIES, IF YOU'RE THE TYPE OF GIRL WHO HAS A VERY SUBTLE ORGASM, WHO DOESN'T REALLY YELL AND SCREAM, IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY-- NAY, YOUR SOLEMN DUTY-- TO TELL THE GUY HE JUST MADE YOU COME. OTHERWISE, HOW THE HELL ARE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW? WHAT, AM I THE FUCKING PUSSY WHISPERER? [laughter] AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT, I'M SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT HOW YOU WANT TO HAVE A SIMULTANEOUS ORGASM. CAN I PLEASE JUST HAVE MY OWN ORGASM? YOU GET A WHOLE BUNCH. I ONLY GET ONE AT THE END. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO ENJOY MINE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT GETTING YOU OFF AT THE EXACT SAME TIME. YOU SEE, GUYS GIVE GIRLS ORGASMS. IT'S A MANUAL PROCEDURE. MEDIUM THRUST. CHECK. PLAY WITH HER CLIT. CHECK. TEASE HER ASSHOLE. CHECK. AND WE HAVE LIFT-OFF. BUT GIRLS DON'T GIVE GUYS ORGASMS. THE MALE ORGASM IS LIKE FLYING ON AUTOPILOT. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, I'M GOING TO GET WHERE I'M GOING EVENTUALLY. [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] THANK YOU. I'VE FAKED AN ORGASM. SURE. GUYS CAN DO IT. IF I'M, LIKE, REALLY WASTED, I JUST WANT TO CUT MY LOSSES... [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] ALL I DO IS THROW IN A GRUNT... UGH... AND ROLL CLEAR. WORKS LIKE A CHARM. I RECENTLY HOOKED UP WITH THIS GIRL WHO'S 22. UH... [cheers] BUT SINCE I'M 30, I HAVE BEEN HAVING SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT HER AGE. I DON'T KNOW. LIKE, I FEEL LIKE SHE MAY BE TOO OLD FOR ME. [laughter] I GO TO THIS GIRL. I'M, LIKE, "OH, YOU GOT TO MEET MY BEST FRIEND CLAUDIO. "I'VE KNOWN HIM SINCE BEFORE YOU WERE BORN. "OH, MY GOD. I'M NOT EVEN EXAGGERATING. I'M SO TURNED ON RIGHT NOW." I WAS LIKE, "WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, FACEBOOK WAS A BOOK." [laughter] THE WEIRD THING THOUGH IS THAT THE PAST FEW GIRLS I'VE FUCKED HAVE ALL BEEN PRETTY SIMILAR, THEY'RE JUST GETTING PROGRESSIVELY YOUNGER. LIKE, FIRST, I HOOKED UP WITH A SMART, CUTE BRUNETTE WHO WAS MY AGE. THEN I HOOKED UP WITH A SMART, CUTE BRUNETTE WHO'S FOUR YEARS YOUNGER. NOW I'M HOOKING UP WITH A SMART, CUTE BRUNETTE WHO'S EIGHT YEARS YOUNGER. IT'S LIKE BANGING BENJAMIN BUTTON. [laughter] NO WHAT MATTER HER AGE THOUGH, WHEN I GO HOME WITH A GIRL, THERE IS ONE SITUATION WHICH IS AN ABSOLUTE, WORST-CASE SCENARIO AND THAT IS IF SHE HAS A PET. NOT BECAUSE I'M ALLERGIC. BECAUSE I FUCKING HATE ALL ANIMALS. [cheers] I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A DOG OR A CAT OR A BIRD OR A GERBIL, GET IT OUT OF MY FUCKING FACE! IT'S NOT NORMAL FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ANIMALS RUNNING AROUND THEIR HOUSE! IT SMELLS AND IT'S GROSS! AND I DON'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT YOU NAMED THEM AFTER! AND I'M SORRY I CALLED IT A HE WHEN IT'S A SHE OR A SHE WHEN IT'S A HE! AND, NO, A CAT ISN'T THE CLEANEST ANIMAL THERE IS! IT SHITS IN A FUCKING BOX IN THE KITCHEN! GET IT AWAY FROM ME! [cheers and applause] I HATE ANIMALS! I CAN BARELY STAND HUMANS. HALF THE CROWD HATES ME NOW, BUT THE OTHER HALF THINKS I'M A HERO. [cheers and applause] THE TRUTH IS THOUGH A LOT OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE MARRIED ACTUALLY MET THEIR HUSBANDS OR WIVES IN WHAT BEGAN AS A ONE-NIGHT STAND AND THEN JUST BLOSSOMED INTO A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP. THEREFORE IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THAT'S HOW I'LL MEET MY FUTURE WIFE AS WELL. [laughter] SO I FIGURE THE NEXT TIME I TRY TO TAKE A GIRL HOME FROM THE BAR AND SHE OBJECTS ASKING "WHAT KIND OF GIRL DO YOU THINK I AM?" I CAN RESPOND "WELL, I GUESS NOT MARRIAGE MATERIAL." [laughter] THE BEST WAY TO SUM UP BEING SINGLE AND 30 IS THIS: GIRLS ARE DESPERATE FOR GUYS TO GET DOWN ON ONE KNEE, BUT GUYS ARE STILL DESPERATE FOR GIRLS TO GET DOWN ON BOTH KNEES. [cheers and applause] I HAVE SOME BUDDIES WHO'VE BEEN DATING THEIR GIRLFRIENDS, LIKE, FOREVER. BUT THEY REFUSE TO GET ENGAGED BECAUSE THEY'RE CONVINCED THEY CAN STILL DO BETTER. MY BUDDY'S, LIKE, "LISTEN, LINDSEY'S GREAT. I JUST WISH I MET HER FIVE YEARS FROM NOW." I'M, LIKE, "DUDE, IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, "YOU PEAKED IN HIGH SCHOOL. "YOU'RE LUCKY LINDSEY WILL STILL HAVE YOU. "YOU'RE DISGUSTING. "IN FACT, IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE QUESTIONING "WHY YOU'RE EVEN DATING A GIRL WHO WOULD FUCK SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU." [laughter] NOW, MY ENGAGED FRIENDS KNOW THAT IF THEY INVITE ME TO THEIR WEDDING, I CONSIDER IT A SERIOUS HONOR. I WILL PURCHASE A PLANE TICKET. I WILL GET MY TUX DRY-CLEANED. I WILL SHOW UP ON TIME AND PROCEED TO GET FUCKING WASTED! [cheers and applause] BECAUSE I'M CELEBRATING THE FACT THAT I'M NOT GETTING FUCKING MARRIED. [cheers and applause] FIRST OF ALL, I WISH THE LITTLE PROGRAM THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU ARRIVED AT THE CEREMONY INCLUDED NOT ONLY THE BRIDESMAIDS' NAMES BUT ALSO THEIR RELATIONSHIP STATUS, WEAKNESSES, AND SEXUAL PROCLIVITIES. [cheers and applause] IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE "MELINDA KNOWS THE BRIDE FROM CAMP. "IS 31. RECENTLY SINGLE. "AND IF SHE HAS MORE THAN FOUR GLASSES OF CHAMPAGNE, WILL TOUCH YOUR DICK BY THE MAIN COURSE." [laughter] "HELLO, MELINDA." AND, LISTEN, ENGAGED PEOPLE, DO ME A FAVOR, IF YOU'RE GONNA SIT ME AT THE SINGLES TABLE, MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T ANY FUCKING COUPLES SITTING THERE! THIS IS MY TABLE! LAST WEDDING I WENT TO, I WAS SITTING WITH FOUR COUPLES AND THE GROOM'S PERSONAL TRAINER. [laughter] IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT THAT I REALIZED I WAS THE SECOND-TO-LAST PERSON INVITED TO THAT WEDDING. [laughter] THE FINAL CUTS WERE ME AND THEN THE PERSONAL TRAINER. PLUS THE GROOM WAS FAT AS SHIT. WHY ARE YOU INVITING YOUR TRAINER IF HE SUCKS? [laughter] NOW, WEDDINGS ARE, OF COURSE, AN APPROXIMATELY FIVE-HOUR OPEN BAR. IT'S A FUCKING BLOODBATH. NOW, PERSONALLY, I AM PROUD OF THE FACT THAT I HAVE NEVER ONCE BEEN SOBER ENOUGH TO WITNESS THE CUTTING, SERVING, OR CONSUMING OF THE WEDDING CAKE. [applause] EVERY SINGLE WEDDING I'VE EVER BEEN TO, I'M, LIKE... "WHERE THE FUCK DID YOU GET THAT CAKE? [laughter] [groans] "YEAH, YOU LIKE THAT, PERSONAL TRAINER? YOU LIKE THOSE CARBS? AGH AGH AGH." SOMETIMES I'LL GO TO ONE OF MY BOYS' WEDDINGS AND THEN AFTERWARDS GET A THANK YOU NOTE THAT'S OBVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY THE WIFE WHO I'M NOT REALLY FRIENDS WITH. AND IT'S ALWAYS WRITTEN IN THAT REALLY NEAT, GIRLY HANDWRITING THAT BARELY CONCEALS THE FACT THAT SHE FUCKING HATES ME. [laughter] IT'S, LIKE, "DEAR KARO, "THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF OUR WEDDING AND NOT VOMITING UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY." [laughter] "YOU'RE WELCOME." [laughter] "WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SHOT GLASSES YOU GOT US AS WELL AS THREE OF THE FOUR NAPKIN RINGS WE REGISTERED FOR." [laughter] FUCK IT. "ALSO, THANK YOU FOR ORGANIZING THE BACHELOR PARTY FOR JOHN. "BY THE WAY, HE ADMITTED TO ME THAT YOU PAID FOR A STRIPPER TO BLOW HIM." [scattered applause and laughter] "WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?" [laughter] "ALSO, WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE, "PLEASE PICK UP YOUR TUX PANTS, "WHICH FOR SOME REASON THE CATERER FOUND "IN THE WOMEN'S BATHROOM. [laughter] PS, MELINDA SAYS HI." [laughter] NOW, I'M ACTUALLY NOT THAT BIG INTO STRIP CLUBS. BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE A BACHELOR PARTY TRADITION SO I'LL GO. I'LL LOOK AT TITTIES. BUT I WON'T LIKE IT. I'LL TOUCH THE TITTIES. IT'S LIKE A PETTING ZOO. AND I LOVE HOW SOME WOMEN THINK THEIR FIANCE ISN'T GOING TO A STRIP CLUB FOR HIS BACHELOR PARTY. THIS ONE GIRL TOLD ME "OH, HE'S NOT INTO THAT KIND OF THING. HE'S GOING CAMPING INSTEAD." [laughter] HONEY, WHEN YOUR FIANCE TELLS YOU HE'S GOING AWAY WITH HIS TEN BEST FRIENDS FOR THREE DAYS WITHOUT CELL OR INTERNET SERVICE, HE'S GOING TO A WHORE HOUSE. [laughter] AND I FEEL LIKE MY FRIENDS' WIVES ARE ALWAYS NERVOUS THAT THEIR HUSBANDS ARE GOING TO A BACHELOR PARTY AND I'M GONNA BE THERE. LADIES, I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU, AT EVERY BACHELOR PARTY, THERE ARE TWO FACTIONS THE SINGLE GUYS AND THE MARRIED GUYS. YOU KNOW WHICH ONES ARE CRAZIER? THE MARRIED GUYS. A MARRIED GUY AT A BACHELOR PARTY IS LIKE A RABID TASMANIAN DEVIL ON METHAMPHETAMINES LACED WITH CIALIS. "OH, MY GOD. FUCKING TITS AND LAP DANCES. "I'M SO FUCKED UP. IT'S 7:00 IN THE MORNING. KARO, CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?" I'M, LIKE, "DUDE, THIS IS WHAT MY LIFE IS NORMALLY LIKE." [laughter] IN FACT, AT MOST BACHELOR PARTIES I'VE BEEN TO, IT'S ALWAYS THE MARRIED GUY WHO, LIKE, RESEARCHES THE STRIP CLUB AHEAD OF TIME. AND THEN SHOWS UP IN ADIDAS WARM-UP PANTS. NO UNDERWEAR. [ohs and laughter] I SEE SOME OF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR. IT'S A GREAT MOVE. IT'S PRACTICALLY PENETRATION. SOME OF THE DUDES ARE LIKE, "I KNOW THAT GUY." [laughter] SOME OF THE DUDES ARE LIKE, "I AM THAT GUY." [laughter] AND THE REST OF YOU ARE LIKE, "THAT'S THE SINGLE GREATEST IDEA I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE." [laughter] [scattered cheers and applause] BUT, UH, I AM FRIENDS WITH THIS ONE COUPLE. THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR A YEAR, BUT THEY STILL USE CONDOMS BECAUSE SHE'S ALLERGIC TO BIRTH CONTROL. THE PILL JUST DOESN'T AGREE WITH HER. FIRST OF ALL, WORST ALLERGY EVER. THAT'S LIKE BEING ALLERGIC TO FUN. [laughter] AND MY FRIEND'S ALWAYS LIKE "OH, MY HUSBAND'S SUCH A TROOPER." I'M, LIKE, "I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. HE FUCKING HATES YOU." [laughter] BUT I THINK THE FACT THAT THEY STILL USE CONDOMS DEMONSTRATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH SOME PEOPLE WILL GO TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T HAVE KIDS AND RUIN THEIR LIVES. [laughter] NOW, THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME IN MY FAMILY TO HAVE KIDS BECAUSE I'M THE LAST MALE KARO. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN CARRY ON THE KARO NAME. WHEN SHE WAS STILL ALIVE, MY GRANDMA ALWAYS USED TO SAY TO ME "AARON, YOU GOT TO HAVE FOUR BOYS. "YOU GOT TO PROMISE YOU'LL HAVE FOUR SONS TO MAKE SURE THEY CARRY ON THE NAME." AND I'D BE, LIKE, "GRANDMA, I'M SIX. [laughter] I DON'T EVEN LIKE GIRLS." AND NOW MY MOM IS SO DESPERATE FOR GRANDCHILDREN, SHE ACTUALLY TOLD MY DAD SHE'D BE FINE WITH IT IF I HAD A KID OUT OF WEDLOCK. THANKS FOR THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, MOM. THE ONLY UPSIDE IS THAT IF I MEET A CHICK AT A BAR AND SHE'S DOWN TO FUCK, BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONDOMS, I CAN BE, LIKE, "DON'T WORRY, MY MOM SAID IT'S OKAY." [laughter] I MEAN, JESUS, MOM. YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK. I LIVE IN L.A. WHO'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR BASTARD GRANDCHILD? NOT I. I WON'T EVEN BUY MICROWAVABLE SOUP UNLESS IT'S THE KIND YOU CAN EAT DIRECTLY OUT OF. WHAT? USE A CAN OPENER? THEN POUR IT INTO A BOWL? TOO MUCH WORK. I'LL STARVE. THE KID WON'T MAKE IT TO TWO. [laughter] WHEN I TURNED 30 THIS YEAR, MY DAD GAVE ME A PICTURE OF HIM WHEN HE WAS 30. AND HE WAS SITTING IN HIS BACKYARD HOLDING BABY ME IN HIS LAP. HE OWNED A HOUSE AND RAISED A NEWBORN. I RENT A ONE-BEDROOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL. [laughter] IF A SPIDER EVER CRAWLS INTO THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL, GAME OVER, I JUST MOVE OUT. [laughter] AND LISTENING TO PREGNANT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THEIR UNBORN CHILDREN IS JUST TORTURE. I MEAN, HOW LONG UNTIL SOMEONE JUST CREATES A FACEBOOK PAGE FOR THEIR FETUS? [laughter] SONOGRAM FOR A PROFILE PICTURE. - YES. FAVORITE MOVIE: "LOOK WHO'S TALKING." [laughter] BIRTHDAY: HOPEFULLY SOON. ACTIVITIES AND INTERESTS: MITOSIS. [laughter] STATUS: JUST CHECKING OUT MY NEW COCK. [laughter] "L-L-O-L." I'M JUST NOWHERE NEAR READY FOR ANY OF THIS, YOU KNOW? A FEW OF MY FRIENDS ARE PREGNANT NOW. AND IT'S JUST WEIRD FOR ME TO THINK ABOUT HOW OLD THEIR KIDS ARE GOING TO BE BY THE TIME I ACTUALLY HAVE KIDS. LIKE, I REALLY LOOK AT EACH OF MY FRIEND'S NEWBORNS AS A POTENTIAL BABY-SITTER. OR A DATE. [laughter and ohs] [scattered applause] HA HA. ONE OF MY HIGH SCHOOL BUDDIES JUST MARRIED A WOMAN WHO ALREADY HAS A KID. I COULD NEVER DO THAT. IF THIS RELATIONSHIP IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMMATURE WHINER WHO VOMITS WITHOUT WARNING, IT'S GONNA BE ME. I'M SORRY, SINGLE MOMS, BUT YOUR KID IS A DEAL BREAKER. I WON'T EVEN DATE A GIRL WHO LIVES MORE THAN FIVE BLOCKS AWAY FROM ME. I WON'T DATE A RED SOX FAN. I WON'T DATE A SMOKER. [crowd commotion and boos] SORRY. I WON'T DATE A SOX FAN. I WON'T DATE A SMOKER. I WON'T DATE A GIRL WHO DOESN'T DRINK. I WON'T DATE A GIRL WITH A HOTMAIL ACCOUNT. [laughter] I WON'T EVEN DATE A GIRL WITH A ROOMMATE, LET ALONE ONE THAT WEARS DIAPERS AND DOESN'T SHUT THE FUCK UP. [laughter] AND I HATE HOW NEW PARENTS ALWAYS USE THEIR KID AS AN EXCUSE. "WELL, I'D LOVE TO MAKE IT, BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT THE TWO-YEAR-OLD AT HOME. HA HA HA HA." GO FUCK YOURSELF. [laughter and applause] MY OLD BOSS, WHEN I USED TO WORK ON WALL STREET, HAD THIS CUTE LITTLE DAUGHTER. AND HE'D ALWAYS TELL ME HOW SHE'D GET INTO THIS JAR OF CANDY THAT SHE AND HIS WIFE KEPT IN THE KITCHEN. SO FINALLY THEY MOVED THE JAR TO THE TOP OF THE FRIDGE SO THE GIRL COULDN'T GET TO IT. THEN HE TELLS ME THAT WHEN HE AND HIS WIFE WEREN'T WATCHING, THIS LITTLE GIRL GOES INTO THE BATHROOM, PEELS UP THE BATH MAT FROM THE TUB, CARRIES IT INTO THE KITCHEN, PULLS OUT ALL THE DRAWERS AND ONE OF THE CABINETS, USES THEM AS MAKESHIFT STAIRS TO CLIMB ONTO THE COUNTER. USES THE BATH MAT AS TRACTION TO CLIMB ONTO A SMALL SHELF. FROM THE SHELF JUMPS THE TOP OF THE FRIDGE. GOT TO THE CANDY JAR. I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S NOT A THREE-YEAR-OLD. THAT'S A VELOCIRAPTOR." [laughter] I, UH--I HAVE HAD A PREGNANCY SCARE IN MY LIFE. UH, HAPPENED A FEW YEARS AGO BACK WHEN I WAS STILL LIVING IN NEW YORK. AND MY GIRLFRIEND AT THE TIME CAME OVER TO MY PLACE AND SHE WAS LIKE, "I'M LATE." AND I WAS LIKE, "ACTUALLY, YOU'RE KIND OF EARLY. I WAS GONNA JERK OFF BEFORE YOU GO THERE." AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, NO, NO. I'M LATE." "OH. OH." AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT TO MYSELF "OH, MY GOD. "I'VE ONLY BEEN DATING THIS GIRL FOR, LIKE, FOUR MONTHS. "I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE FEELS ABOUT ABORTION. [scattered applause] [scattered cheers] SO SHE MAKES ME GO TO CVS AT, LIKE, 11:00 AT NIGHT TO GET THE PREGNANCY TEST. [laughter] NOW THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF WALKS WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH CVS LOOKING FOR A PREGNANCY TEST. THERE'S... [singing] GONNA HAVE A KID WITH MY LOVE WHO I LOVE AND WE'RE READY [laughter] [cheers] AND THERE WAS MY WALK. [humming Star Wars' The Imperial March] $24.99? WHAT THE FUCK? [laughter] [continues humming The Imperial March] OOH, GENERIC BRAND. [laughter] AND I GO TO CHECK OUT AND THE CASHIER MUST NOT HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON MY FACE 'CAUSE SHE WAS LIKE, "GOOD LUCK. [laughter] "DO YOU HAVE A CVS CARD?" "NO. JUST--JUST--JUST THIS." "WOULD YOU LIKE TO APPLY FOR A CVS CARD?" "OH, GOD, PLEASE, WHY? UGH." SO I APPLY FOR THE CVS CARD. [laughter] I BRING THE TEST HOME. MY GIRLFRIEND PEES ON THE STICK. AND CAN I JUST SAY: IS THIS THE BEST TECHNOLOGY WE CAN COME UP WITH? PEEING ON A STICK? I CAN'T ACCURATELY PISS ON ANYTHING AND I HAVE MANUAL CONTROL. [laughter] THEN THEY MAKE YOU WAIT THE LONGEST THREE MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE AND THE RESULTS COULD NOT BE MORE UNCLEAR. TRYING TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS OF A PREGNANCY TEST IS LIKE BEING IN A DIVE BAR AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE'S THE GUY'S BATHROOM BY LOOKING AT THE PICTURES ON THE DOORS. ONE'S LIKE A CAT IN A TOP HAT. THE OTHER'S A TURTLE IN A TUXEDO. WHICH ONE'S WHICH? A PREGNANCY TEST SHOULD ONLY HAVE TWO RESULTS: "YOU'RE FUCKED" AND "KEEP ON FUCKING." - YEAH! WHOO! - WHOO! [applause] - SO THANKFULLY, SHE WASN'T PREGNANT AND SHE ENDED UP GETTING HER PERIOD THE NEXT DAY. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MAN. WHEW! I NEVER WANT TO GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN." AND SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, EVEN THOUGH I'M ON THE PILL, "MAYBE FOR A LITTLE WHILE, JUST TO BE SAFE, WE SHOULD USE CONDOMS TOO." AND I WAS LIKE, "MMMMMM... "NAAAAH. FUCK IT. "I'LL RISK IT. "IT'S NOT WORTH IT. BESIDES, NOW I HAVE A CVS CARD." [laughter] [applause] NOW, AS A COMEDIAN, OBVIOUSLY, I TRAVEL A LOT. I'M ON A PLANE LIKE EVERY DAY. AND THE ONE THING... THAT I FUCKING HATE MORE THAN ANYTHING IS WHEN FAMILIES ASK ME TO SWITCH SEATS TO ACCOMMODATE THEM. "WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY? "YOU'D LIKE TO SWITCH SEATS WITH ME "'CAUSE YOU'RE SEPARATED FROM YOUR KID? "WELL, LET ME SEE HOW I CAN MAKE THIS CLEAR. "I DON'T GIVE A SHIT! "LISTEN, BUDDY, I TOOK THE TIME TO CHECK IN ONLINE, "CHOOSE EXACTLY THE SEAT I WANTED, "AND PRINT MY BOARDING PASS AT HOME. "NOW YOU EXPECT ME TO SACRIFICE MY OWN COMFORT "JUST BECAUSE YOU FORGOT TO PULL OUT? "NOT A CHANCE! [cheers and applause] "NOT A CHANCE! "I DON'T GIVE A FUCK IF YOU, AND YOUR WIFE, "AND YOUR NEWBORN BABY "ARE SITTING NOWHERE NEAR EACH OTHER. "YOU SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THAT AHEAD OF TIME, MOTHER FUCKER. "FUCK YOU. I WILL NOT GIVE UP MY SEAT. I AM LIKE THE ROSA PARKS OF THIS PLANE." [cheers and applause] NOW, BOSTON, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE TONIGHT. BUT BEFORE I LET YOU GO, I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HOMEWORK. - KARO! - WHOO! - YEAH! - YOU SEE, THE THINGS IS, DESPITE ALL MY WARNINGS AND ADVICE, A FEW OF MY FRIENDS RECENTLY GOT ENGAGED. BUT I'VE COME UP WITH A PLAN TO MAKE THEIR WEDDINGS MORE FUN. SO MY RULE, WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL HELP SPREAD ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IS THAT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE A SPEECH UNLESS YOU TELL THE TRUE STORY OF HOW THE BRIDE AND GROOM ACTUALLY MET. [cheers and applause] BECAUSE LET'S BE HONEST, THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD REALLY BE LIKE... "I'M SO EXCITED TO BE HERE "TO CELEBRATE WITH RACHEL AND SCOTT. "RACHEL AND SCOTT MET IN A BAR. "RACHEL SPILLED A DRINK ON SCOTT BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FUCKED UP "FROM PARTYING WITH HER FRIENDS WHO WERE VISITING "FOR THE LONG WEEKEND. "SCOTT TOOK RACHEL HOME. "BUT HE ALMOST BAILED WHEN HE FOUND OUT "SHE HAS A CAT. "NOT ONLY IS HE ALLERGIC TO CATS, BUT HE HATES CATS "BECAUSE CATS ARE THE FUCKING WORST. [laughter] [cheers and applause] "AND THE STORY ALMOST ENDED THERE. "BUT THANKFULLY, SCOTT STAYED BECAUSE HE TOO WAS WASTED. "THE RESULT OF AN ILL-ADVISED SHOT "THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY THE BANG OF A GONG. "SO RACHEL AND SCOTT HOOKED UP. "RACHEL WENT DOWN ON SCOTT, "WHICH WAS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN THAT SHE'S A CAPRICORN. [laughter] [cheers and applause] AND THE REST IS HISTORY." BOSTON! THANK YOU VERY MUCH! THANK YOU! THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FUCK ME. [cheers and applause] LET'S GET WASTED! THANK YOU, GUYS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU, GUYS. [hard rock music]
