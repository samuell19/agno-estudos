Members desirous of taking their seats will be pleased to come to the table I?m desirous of taking the oath on the Old Testament. Order! Baron Lionel de Rotschild, you may withdraw. Mr Disraeli! Baron Rotschild has been freely and fairly elected by the City of London as a member of this parliament. To deny him his seat as a Jew is to publish to the world that we are still influenced by the darkest superstitions of the darkest ages that ever existed in this country. We take our oath from the true faith of Christianity I cannot sit in his house with any misconceptions of my opinion on this subject. what ever maybe the results on the seat that I hold. This is a Christian assembly Yes! And it is as a Christian that I will not take upon myself the awful responsibility of excluding from the legislature those in whose religion my Lord and savior was born! You made hats! Yes I was an apprentice milliner to eke out but it didn?t last long. I was the belle of Clifton. All the young gentleman in the West Country used to pay court to me. I married my first husband when I was 17. You make it sound as though you?d had half a dozen, my dear. I think it sounds very romantic. So did I at the time, but I didn?t know the meaning of the word till I met Dizzy. More tea, mrs Gladstone? No. Thank you, it was lovely. Mr Glastone? No, thank you, no. I believe we were all married in the same year! I believe so. Though it seem so recent. But I was looking through one of my scrapbooks today and I realize it?s nearly 20 years ago! You keep a scrapbook? Of course. What do you put in them? Anything from the newspapers and magazines that mentions Dizzy. Marianne is my most faithful archivist. Here?s a report of the speech from "The times"... oh...comments from the "Quarterly review" Oh, no! Oh, well, why not? What is it? It?s a cartoon from "Punch" "The balancing brothers of Westminster" It's clever. Yes, the artist was kinder to you that he was to me. I do not find such drawings amusing. You know what I think it means? That whatever Dizzy proposes, you propose the opposite and vice versa just out of habit. But it could mean that your talents are so evenly balanced that together you could achieve something outstanding! Well that is another matter. I think we might leave the ladies alone for a few moments if they don?t mind. Not at all. if you wish We shall be in the study. Oh aren't we fortunate to have such remarkable husbands? I always said how clever Mr Disraeli is You know what Dizzy admires most about Mr Gladstone? It?s his moral courage, course Dizzy has none at all. But that can?t be true.. Oh, yes, it is When he takes a shower he can never pull the string for the cold water I always have to do it for him. You must come and visit us at Hughenden someday That would be delightful! and you must come to Howden. I hear it?s very beautiful. Oh, I think so. And more beautiful every year. We must clear another acre in the park. It's fitted? Yes, of trees. His relaxation is tree filling. Opening up new areas How different to Dizzy. His passion is well.. planting trees and watching them growing into forests. One should treat a cigar like a mistress. Put it away before one gets sick of it. Well, that is the position as we see it. Frankly, we need you! It probably would not be so great a step you have supported us pretty steadily for the last three years, yes... There is a small but active section of your party in.. Our party A section who regard me as representing dangerous ideas. You wish for reform is so do I, and always have done Now, in truth Mr Gladstone, it's the relation between us that form the great difficulty. Between us? I have never in my life taken a decision which has been influenced by it. I?m glad to hear it. But I can assure you that if you join Lord Derby's cabinet you will find warm personal friends and admirers. Now, you may consider me as neither, but I assure you you would be wrong. I must consider the conditions that would make cooperation possible. What I said just now was not near empty words! I have asked James Graham to accept the post as leader of the House of Commons in my place, to allow both of us to serve under him. Now, if he will not accept we should let our fellow members decide which of us is to lead In either case, I can assure you that I would consider you as sharing equally in any position I might vote. I need time to reflect. Situation is critical! For you to stand aside at a time like this is is a great responsibility. Don?t you think it?s a time you might gain to be magnanimous? There's a party beyond us that disposes of what we are doing To define the limits of choice in public life it would be very narrow. Sent.. handbag He may wrap himself in a cloak of morality but he is really driven by only two things: personal ambition and envy of you. Well, what would he do now? Wait on the sideline seeing which way to jump! That?s enough of him! I must get back to Downing Street. And you must get ready! Now remember, no commitments to anything and don?t try to be witty. I was decidedly not. They still distrust you. Who? This time you must try and win their approval. Whose approval? It?s been decided that... It?s been decided that Dizzy should be the one to report cabinet business. I have to go to Windsor for an audience with the queen and the Prince That?s wonderful! It?s what we?ve prayed for! It?ll give you a chance to win them over! Remains to be seen. Of course you will. I forbid you to be nervous! Easier said my dear. Facing Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is like looking down on muzzle of a double barreled shotgun. So, you call it a rebellion and not a mutiny? In a mutiny is merely a rising of soldiers against their officers, but this is much more. This is a national revolt amongst all classes of the Indian people. Yes, that is true. Then I assume you are not in favor of reprisals. There must be punishment for those guilty of atrocities but for those who fought against what they see as persecution there must be justice tempered with mercy. Yes. Her Majesty and I have discussed this matter fully and have reached the same conclusions. You spoke of a change of policy. What do you propose? We propose, Madam, to take the rule and power of India from the East India company and transfer it to the Crown to appoint a viceroy and to issue a proclamation to the native Princes and population that the queen of England guarantees their laws customs and religion That could do much! More than Olafsson armies, Sir! I look forward to seeing your detailed proposals! But what is the feeling of the House toward your government now? It's no kind, Sir but for now the opposition is content to let us pull their chestnuts out of the fire. And after so many years in temporary quarters it is a pleasure to be in the new House of Commons which is so admirably suited to our purposes. I assume it no was chairman of the weak construction committee. Of course! That explains if I may be permitted, ma'm, a brilliant use of space and the perfect blend of comfort with harmonious proportions. We must not detain you any longer, Mr Disraeli Your most faithful servant ma'm. What an extraordinary man! He?s really quite handsome, don't you think? ..although so very Jewish.. I cannot understand why I had such an unfavorable opinion of him Our views are so surprisingly similar! Feeling about it You cannot expect us to support you in this bill, Mr Disraeli! But I do, Robert! Giving the right to vote to the lower paid can only benefit the liberals. I should have thought that the cure and justices would have been the aim of every responsible government Reform is a dangerous experiment. Dangerous for the country and the government. Robert! No, father I must speak! It's only that many others are thinking! Political thought must develop even in the Conservative party. I tell you frankly, sir, I cannot support you. I must apologize for my son It's no need, Lord Salisbury. Robert Cecil is right in a way. Voting reforming is liberal policy, it will not please our own supporters This is why we need all the strength we can muster, and I should expect you to speak, Edward. As you know I have been in poor health for sometime, I doubt if I could stand the strain of a violent debate. Everyone must be there even if they have to be carry in on a spectrum I should give you a public funeral if you die Radicals should back us. Precisely Disraeli is selling us out! Well, I am with him! The right to vote must be extended. I agree... with his way of beating the continuous majority of the liberals in parliament I don?t know I can?t vote against my own party but... Have you heard, Mr Gladstone? what do you say? this attempt to carry favor with the lower elements is the acting of an adventurer desperate to cling to power at any price. You should appeal to the honor of your leader It?s no use. Lord Derby is only interested in his race horses. He leaves everything to Disraeli. That?s what it?s come to. We are governed by a Jew and a jockey! So the eyes have it! Resign! All the liberals have to do is promise to radicals more sweeping reforms if they voted against it! Once again Derby will have to resign? /Disraeli? Those in favor say "aye" Aye! Now, my dearest. The doctors expressly said that you were to stay in bed. Oh, I didn?t either fretting. Besides Lord Stanley?s coming to dinner and I?ve gotta cut your hair before he arrive. Please spare me that. Something wrong? I?ve just been reading this article by Robert Cecil in the "Quarterly review" But the son of one of your oldest friends should write such a thing? "Mr Disraeli's policies in the House of Commons have long discredited and misguided - "the conservative party and his tactics associate his only doing". What young politicians do to fill the career? Attack their elders. yes they must makes me angry is the fact that it appeared in the "Quarterly review" the leading conservative journal But it's clear proof that your own party still doesn?t trust you! I doubt of it How? I?ve written an open letter to all the leading members of my party saying that since they all obviously agree with this attack on me that I should resign soon as possible Would they accept? Of course not the mere threat was enough. they begged me to reconsider which of course I shall. It?s all a game to you, isn?t it? A great game!No. No, not entirely. No, not entirely. After 23 years of service 23 years of struggle, what have you? Nothing but bills and debts and demand for payments. Something will turn up, it always does. They will be met How? By borrowing more and more money? When will it end? Mary Anne, do not distress yourself. You know that whatever happened you need ever worry. I am not thinking about myself, don?t you understand? I shouldn?t have to wait to be here on money dies with me What will you do when I?m gone? I cannot imagine such an empty world. I would rather live with you in a hovel than with the Duchess in a tower of gold Should I tell you the news it will make the wife of every member of parliament envious of you? Envious of me? No, mad with envy What is it, Dizzy dearest? What news? We have been invited to spend the weekend at Windsor Castle with the queen and the Prince consort. why isn?t this last That?s what makes it so special for you, please. I didn?t ever feel terrified Is it true? Dizzy..I?ll stay and do all the wrong things You know I don?t know how to behave... Just be yourself, Marianne They're bound to adore you. So like Lord John, you have no intention of retiring. Politicians rarely retires, sir. Sometimes they hang on until they have to be carried. Frankly, you know I?m surprised you didn?t accept your appointment as first viceroy of India. No doubt the government thought of it as an ideal way of removing me from the scene.. But I shall agree I was tempted Sumptuous palaces, jewel potented, all the riches of the east Mrs Disraeli and I arriving for the "durbar" in a gilded elephant like a scene of one of my novels. No, no it would have meant saying goodbye forever to the House of Commons. It appears my daughter has monopolized you all evening, Mrs Disraeli. His Highness has been most kind Ma'm And what have you been discussing Alice? Education, mamma. I can scarcely believe that Mrs Disraeli left school when he was 15. She was never at university But surely, I heard she?d received a degree at Oxford! Yes but an honorary one and an ADCL I think Do you mean DCL Mrs Disraeli, doctor of civil law. yesm yesm something of the sort. committed for young ladies I should have liked to have gone to universe Nothing I'd like more. That's a very modern idea my dear Still perhaps you... well you don?t know the benefit of having an affectionate husband. How very true! And were you present at the degree ceremony Mrs Disraeli? Yes, I wouldn't have missed it. Dizzy was very apprehensive, you see. He thinks that all students are radicals but they cheer him louder than anyone. Is that so? And do you attend many functions with your husband, Mrs Disraeli? Sadly no, he?s so busy But then you do understand that, ma?am? Too well. We must take you to the exhibition at the British Museum. Yes, it is very fine So many beautiful things. There?s a statue of Apollo which has especially impressed me, absolute perfection form Yes but you should see my Dizzy in the bath! Alice you should not be listening! May we know how you are laughing my dear I couldn?t possibly tell you. You look more relaxed than I?ve seen you for weeks. Well perhaps that is because I have at last met a statesman with unbiased opinions. It is difficult to remain prejudiced in the company of an enlightened Prince. Well we have both in our time being accused of being alien. Hopefully we have now both proved that we have our country?s interest at heart. Mr. Disraeli! We just had word, Prince Albert has fever It's typhoid! They can?t save him! In your position as leader of the opposition I beg that you will not bring about any crisis. I feel that in my present condition I could not survive it. I promise to take no strong action unless it becomes an absolute necessity in the interests of the country I knew I could depend on you Mr Disraeli as on no other. I must thank you once again for your generous praise of my adored beloved husband In these conversations from the late years of the Prince I gained a great deal both in knowledge and feeling which will always influence my life Everyone seem to realize his unequalled worth How immense the loss has been both to myself and to the country Now I feel so alone! Your most faithful servant, Ma'm It?s the one thing that?s always made me envious I?ve always wanted to have a house with a ball room. I?m sure you would fill it every night. Oh, we would and if we run out of guests I get Dizzy to dance with me to dawn, all by ourselves That sounds very exhausting.. Not a bit of it! I'm sure it would be the lady Rotschild myself And I can give you both 100 years, lady Chesterfield! Still I?m all energy When I was a child, my mother used to call me with little Wizzie How fortunate I wasn't christened that, otherwise I?ve been mrs Wizzy Dizzy! Gladstone has officially joined the liberals? On my information is he was promised to be made the Chancellor of the exchequer And Rotchild's information are more reliable than a government dispatched. He is the last person I would have expected to desert his principles and his friends I?m surprised it didn?t happen sooner. Why? The liberal leaders are.. so one day soon he can expect to take their place, whereas with us. He would always be second to you. I'm sorry gentlemen but however much I may agree with you, I don?t think this is a subject we should be discuss here. Don?t pardon that and I had forgotten. You must allow me to observe the fact that you are a radical seems at times thickly incongruous. If you'll excuse me I must greet my hostess. This will make things more difficult for you. No it?s bad enough having you on the opposite side of the House. But thanks to you, you showed the way, I followed it. You won through your own determination. Yes, but 10, 11 years without them letting me take my seat We, Jews have much to thank you for. You haven?t met my special guest. The Prussian. Coming man What is it before long he may be chief minister in Berlin quite charming, his technique is the disarm by... Sir Benjamin Disraeli may I introduce count Otto von Bismarck. I have heard a big deal about you, Mr Disraeli Thank you I noticed your name is mentioned on the continent with more respect than it is here. Will you be stay long? Only a few days, I?m afraid. I find it difficult to talk to your British Foreign Office. They seem to have no real interest in making contacts, exchanging views. They don?t always have any. With you I think I could talk to It is a pity you're not in power. A great pity. I did hear that you may soon be recalled to Berlin. You are remarkably well informed, Mr Disraeli. Yes, it is possible. And once you have assumed responsibility for Prussian affairs, what will your aims be? Frankly? Preferably. I shall reorganize the army with or without the help of Parliament. As soon as it is in a condition to command respect, I shall subdue the minor States and give national unity to Germany. Under Prussian leadership? Naturally. Of course, to do that I must seize the first opportunity to declare war on Austria and to show France that we cannot be intimidated. Then Germany would be able to take her true place in Europe. That is what I came here to tell your Queen's government. Most impressive. Have you set a time limit on it? It shall be completed within the next ten years. Excuse me, I have enjoyed our talk, but I have promised to dance with the Baroness.. Thank you. I?ve had the two minutes allotted to those of little importance You wonder the Foreign office wouldn?t listen to him? But they should. Look out for that man, he means what he says! That young man is here. What young man? Well you know, the one that we met at the duke Cleveland?s...Corry... Montagu Corry. Yes, yes. Yes, that?s him. He?s in there. Have him in. No, no, no. No, you rest your leg, I?ll get him. He.. he seems very serious young man. Oh yes, I think he?s trying to impress me. What does he want? He?s hoping I?ll find him some position, I expect. Not here, surely. He'd make me feel uncomfortable. That?s what I thought until one wet afternoon at Rabi opened the door of the drawing room and found this remarkably grave young man entertaining the young ladies with the knees up dance and the comic song Maybe there?s something in after all! In there. I hope I have not come in an inopportune moment, Sir By no means, Mr Corry. Do you want me to do something for you? What? I am most anxious to get a start in political life, Sir. I adventured to hope that you might know someone to whom my services might be acceptable. What have you been doing? for the past three years I have been in practice as a barrister. I thought you had all the gravity of a country judge but you also do a very funny dance. That's regrettable...I.. Well, the ladies insisted. I realized at once of course that I had forfeited any hope of your good opinion On the contrary I had thought you devilishly... At that moment I said to myself "I think he must be my impresario" Sir? I have to make it more plain. I?m looking for a new private secretary and from all I?ve heard you will do admirably. I?m overcome, Sir. Now you better sit down. I take it you accept? Why, yes! Good! Good, I need someone I can trust because I?m about to go to war. Since Lord Palmerston?s death Mr Gladstone has assumed leadership of the liberals A very forceful man. Quite so! Like all converts has become a fanatic and a dangerous one. I think he?s had his own way for far too long. Now what can Dizzy do? We must trust him. With this new bill, Gladstone gives us no opportunity to fight. Good evening, gentlemen. Thank you, John. Do I interrupt? No, no, not at all! Something wrong? We seem to face a lifetime in opposition. On the countrary. Gladstone had just played into our hands. In what way? He introduced his bill like an Old Testament prophet announcing model through/ but Robert blinded himself by his own righteousness. He sees the vote not as a right but as a privilege to be earned. Now this infuriates the radicals while most of his own party would prefer merely to talk of reform as they have done for the past 50 years. That?s true. So... we have to stimulate both sides and keep proposing amendments. We shall see. If this amendment is carried the government is falling, it?s our duty to resign! Do it now! Resign! I cannot tell you how delighted I am to have you once again as my chancellor, Mr Disraeli. These past years with Mr Gladstone have been very trying. He does not keep me fully informed as you do. He speaks to me as if he was addressing a public meeting, instead of conversation. He lectures me on Homer or the Hittites or the Athanasian creed Allow me to say I have far too much respect for your Majesty ever to let you, especially on the Athanasian creed. But these are difficult times with these reform riots which have swept the country It?s a question that can no longer remain unsettled. Various administrations have tried and all have failed. You must do something about it, Mr Disraeli and immediately. I assure your majesty my government intends to. After all these months of preparation I?m so excited for you! Now you must not be nervous. Even is I am I should not shout. But what is the matter with Robert Cecil and the others? the rest of the party is Tonight we'll settle everything. Thank you for coming with me, my dearest. Now wish me luck. That's my love whatever happens. Open the door! Drive on! Never let it be said that the Commons of England passed a bill such as this! An invitation to mob rule and the corruption of the electorate we must reject, utterly reject this gigantic! cynically conceived for the purposes of the art! Mr Disraeli! The right honourable gentleman has spoken with much eloquence with much passion and much violence.. yet the the damage can be repaired. We?ve done it! We?ve dished away. Now tell me why is Gladstone like a telescope? Why is he? Because Disraeli draws him out sees through him and shuts him up! Never saw anything like this. You are the hero of the hour and well deserved! Very welcome. This is a night that should go on forever You know I must get at home. Mary Ann will be asleep This is historic occasion! You'll disappoint all your friends and supporters. Tonight of all nights I shall be expected home. Monty sent word. Oh, I knew you will. I'm so proud. Well many of the opposition voted with it many abstained and I..think that we... Dearest, not now.. What did you do to your hand, Mary Anne? It?s nothing, it?s just a little.. You talked and talked to us...It's splendid.. Feast and champagne for a christening? My darling..here, more the mistress and me.?my wife. I?m glad Mary Ann has recovered. it isn?t indescribable relief, she has not had an attack like that for quite some time. The queen tell me she was most anxious. Her Majesty sympathy was a great comfort, but then she is very attached to Mary Anne. As to you. I?d say she appreciate you more than any other minister I can remember How did you do it? When everyone responds to flattery with royalty, one simply has to lay it down with the But this does not alter the fact that I do admire her profoundly Just as well. In view of what I meant to say. A year ago, when I mentioned I may have to resign because of my health you begged me to carry on. I no longer have any imortality. My doctors have told me that if I stay in office I have no hope of recovery. Lord Derby.. A year ago I hesitated because I was afraid that the party would still not accept you as Prime Minister. It will never be so. It's you the party and the country need You are fairly and most honorably on your way to the highest rung of the political ladder I am flattered and grateful, but I must ask you to consider taking time. No, I already have. I?ve sent my resignation to the queen at Osborne and recommended that she appoint you in my place. I accepted you as Young England?s leader many years ago. as I was the first day. Let me be the first now. Thank you, John. Whoever thought all those years ago.. that one day you'll be prime minister. I'm climbing to the top of... And I had looked forward to a long and increasingly happy association. The general election could not be delayed any longer, Ma'm Mr Gladstone used the excuse to go barnstorming round the country on some kind of evangelical crusade! and convincing the new electors that their right to vote was given to them not by you, but by himself! Yes, he did turn the election into a pilgrimage of passion. but the liberal majority has been doubled. There is no possibility of my continuing. Then I must accept your resignation, although with much regret. I suppose I shall have to send for Mr Gladstone He is undoubtedly the leader of his party now, Ma'm. the people?s William I must confess ma?am that going to the strain of the last few years I shall not be so reluctant as I might have been to lay down with burden you would not think of retiring I need a during for a period of rest man I?m relieved to hear it And I myself have been concerned about your health, Mr Disraeli Now the strain as you say of conducting daily business in the House of Commons The simplest answer would be for you to lead your party from the Lords and for that purpose and in recognition of your services I would like to offer you a peerage. I am deeply sensible of the favor which your majesty is prepared to bestow. However I feel for the sake of my party I must decline. If that is your wish... There is however someone to whom I might humbly request your majesty to grant an honor. Dizzy..forgive me.. I was waiting for your carriage, I must have dropped off. Well did the queen accept your resignation. With regret, I?m happy to say. Tell me everything. No many things, but most important.. she offered me an Earl. Dizzy! But I told her that if I had been able to accept, I would have chosen the name Beaconsfield from our neighboring town If you'd be able to accept? Many people think it is my fault we lost this election Now Gladstone is returned with an increased majority and I must be there in the Commons to do battle with him. Yes, yes of course. But I?m so disappointed for you, my darling. I?m not disappointed at all. You see the queen has been graciously pleased to transfer the honor to my most trusted and constant companion whose courage has always been my spur and whose love my inspiration It is the greatest privilege I?ve ever been given to tell you that you are now my dearest in your own right, the viscountess Beaconsfield. You must know why Mr Disraeli prefers to work down here in the country, sir Stafford? Of course, I realize that Lady Beaconsfield is unwell. Yet, as leader of the party his place is at Westminster. We hardly ever see him at Westminster Mr Rose. He tells us he?s working on something, but he will not say what it is. I hope it?s not another book "Lothair" was a sensation on both sides of the Atlantic Undoubtedly. Who would ever heard of an ex Prime Minister writing a romantic novel? Dizzy, your terrace is exquisite, but why so many peacocks? They are essential, lady Chesterfield! Whoever heard of a terrace without peacocks? A kind of personal symbol, Elisabeth. Surely not, Baron Baron Rothschild and lady Chesterfield you might Dizzy when he was not always so solemn. The very first time I saw him lady Manners, he was wearing a green velvet jacket, plum colored trousers with gold braid a scarlet waistcoat smothered in gold chains and emerald rings over white gloves. I really cannot imagine it! Young women who only know my Dizzy now think he?s ugly. I don?t think he?s ugly No, you sure I think we might change the subject, my dear He was so striking, all the young women found him irresistible. That?s very true. I never cease to thank Providence Now, the gratitude should be entirely on my side Mary Anne. It?s nothing... it?s it?s just a little twinge I get when I don?t stick to my.. I?ll go Monty... Monty will take me. We can?t both leave our guests. I?m sure that everybody understands Dizzy why did you not warn us? Lady Beaconsfield is clearly much more ill than any of us suspected. What is it? Mary Anne is suffering from cancer of the stomach. I?ve known for five years. Only Monty and I know. Get out the doctors to do something. It's incurable She does not know that I know so to stop worrying me she.. pretends her illnesses is slight and temporary I've not need to ask you not to say... I get Mary Anne to sat lie down It is a full attempt to introduce the siesta to Buckinghamshire. They?ve been badgering you, Philip Moral is delicacy, I would say. You should feel better than to try to work secrets overlawyered, specially mine I assure you I have.. No need, Northcote. I guess your complaints exactly. I have not been writing another book. Philip and I?ve been discussing a plan for the total reorganization of the party. The setting up of a central office to define policy and consult with and advise local constituencies. In short, the creation of a party machine. It cannot be run from here. Which is why I am leaving for London tomorrow. we can't let Gladstone to have it all his own way He?s gaining in strength every day. No one dares stand against him. I thought I might try. Horrible scenes of violence have been occurring in Ireland and the government never moved Landlords were shot down respectable farmers beaten to death policeman stabbed, households blown up! and still the government never moved. Yet, when a government candidate lost an election in Ireland though troops were put in motion. sent from Liverpool to Dublin and I seem to remember, I think it was last year one of her majesty?s ministers saying: "Anyone can govern Ireland with troops and artillery" so it seems, even the right honourable gentleman there. Oh, Dizzy..I?m nearly done. I'm making notes for my speech. Yes, well do so, just pretend I?m not here. Can I? Snip, snip, snip, I feel like I?m falling into the hands of some female Sweeney Todd. Do sit still! I will not have you going to lunch looking like out... I'm not going to Manchester.. why not? not seems to be. The great rally of all the conservative associations and then there?s your speech at the Free Trade Hall Only one of three monster rallies in the north I should expected it at each to make a speech lasting several hours Well think of the effect it will make your own thinking nowadays with my colleagues stay on my feet talking if I drink Brandy and water nonstop. so I should lose the churchgoers and temperance vote straight away Why don?t you put white brandy in the water? The audience will know anyting about it! Lady Beaconsfield...you are as fair an Angel as devious as a.. I beg your pardon.. It's all right I?ve done May I get rid of that for you? Dizzy, don't you?ve worked all Monty too hard! Her fingers are so swollen, she could scarcely hold the scissors. I thought lady Beaconsfield seemed a little better! But she will not give in! She insists on traveling to Manchester with me. Could you not advise against it, Sir because of the falling weather? She will not listen! I'm afraid the journey might prove too much for her For her own sake, sir, could you not refuse to let her go with you? How can I? Every time she hears me speak she?s afraid it will be the last Come on, Monty. Not satisfied with the rape and anarchy of Ireland, they have begun to attack every institution every interest, every class and calling in the country. So all along this so called government of Mr Gladstone has behaved like a body of men under the influence of some drug I watch them in this time progressed It was not difficult to perceive that extravagance was being substituted for energy by this government. Some sought refuge in melancholy and their eminent chief alternated between their menace and their.. As I set up opposed the treasury bench the ministers reminded me of one of those marine landscapes that are not unusual on the coast of South America I?ll be older range of exhausted volcanoes. not a flame flickers on a single pallid Crescent Yet, the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes and ever and anon dark rumblings of the sea. For me? Their affection is as much for you as it is for him They have seen his devotion to you. And I have seen a perfect marriage. Dizzy married me for my money. Well we had to do it again I think he'd marry me for love.
