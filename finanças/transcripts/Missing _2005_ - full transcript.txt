Missing Some things are seeked upon... ...when two footsteps merge into one movement. Two footsteps who should be guided by one purpose... ...even when principles stand in the center of them. I've passed it quite far enough. It has been going on for quite a while. That marriage... ...is one of life's happy episodes. I'm aware of it and I have come to accept it... ...along with all the consequences. Until... ...I found the darkest part... ...which slowly starting to clear itself. A part that I find it difficult to explain myself. Breakfast, Steve. Hello? Maya? Icha? I need to see you now. What's with you? Icha? Fine, I'll be there, okay? Icha? My God, it's been seven days... ...since her death... ...and she is still around me. The kitchen. The living room. Even the bedroom. Wherever I am... ...she still follows me. This was a birthday present from him. Can you help me? Maya, I need to talk to him for just one minute. Who's Maya? Li? Li? It's me, Icha. Li. What? What? I'm a slut? Why am I a slut? You're the slut. You think that all of this time I don't know about it? I've been quiet about it. But I know what you have been doing! You cheated on me with your secretary. How stereotypical. But the funny thing is.... ...that she was never in love with you. This is the only thing she loved. Simply your money. But, foolishly... ...I put up with you. I came to the hospital every day. I took care of you. I fed you. I wiped your sweat. I bathed you. I cleaned your shit! That was disgusting! I felt like vomiting when I cleaned your shit! Do you really think that she would do that to you? She didn't even have the guts to come to the hospital. She even had to be dragged to the hospital to be tested. She gave you the disease. Susan, the bitch. She'd dead now. Just like you. What was that? What? You met her in there? Where? In hell? I hope you're okay with her in there. I really wanted to kill you. All this time, I've been wanting to kill you. But God is just. He gave you a deadly disease. I'm satisfied. I had my revenge. And now... ...I can move on with my life. Stay away! Never come for me again. Thank you, Icha. I'm sorry. It always ends like that, always incomplete. For me it's complete. Have I helped you enough? Very much, Maya. Thank you. But remember, Maya... ...your gift may give you a fatal consequence one day. Miss, what time is it? Hey, Maya, what is it? It's nothing. I'm sorry. When I had finished teaching... ...I had a meeting with the asistant president. Let's chat in there. My concept of speech is closer to scientific studies. I used to think that people with a "third eye" gift like you... ...are a lie. You may keep planning. But please find profiles other than myself. The selling-point of my book is the explanation... ...the acquisition of the public's attention, that spirit mediums... ...the bridge between the dead and the living... ...and that is very helpful for various purposes. I'm sorry, Mr Rizal. Do you know about the death of a female student in this campus? Her name was Meisya. Did she really killed herself? Please, come again some time. Take your friends along. -Okay, thank you. -Okay. That person's asking for something. So? Are you going to help me in this place? I need to notify Steven first. Come on, Maya. Don't refuse a good opportunity. I'm bored. Then go on and have kids. Steven doesn't want kids. Why? He's not ready. No wonder your lives are boring. But how about you? I... ...don't know. -Maya... -This needs time, okay? Well, that's okay... ...but don't let yourself getting too dependant on times, Maya. So, what do you want to eat? It's on me. No, thanks. I'll pass. Your photo is brilliant. Is this one still on for next month's publishing as planned? According to yesterday's meeting, it is. As we need to preserve Indonesian's lost culture. It's not lost, it's simply forgotten a bit. Lost is a ghost for the soul. And if you forget... ...you are gradually making it lost. I've lost you, haven't I? Go to work. Welcome to life. The magazine where I work has a great mission. I enjoy being in their team. Idealistic... ...but not utopic. This is the only magazine... ...which gives an unsaturated reality of our culture. I'm starting to feel sick of this situation. I'm tired. I have to go to Bogor tomorrow. I'd like to work. Dian is asking me to help in her cafe. I think this will be good for us. And to kill my boredom. -Hey! -Sorry, Sir. Can you do your job? Enough! Go away! What's wrong, Maya? No. It's nothing. Seriously? What did you see just now? They're like dust flecks. But they're gone now? They'll never really go away. Are you alright? They would appear before me whenever they feel like it. It's disrupting my life. I can't feel any peace. Sometimes I'm puzzled by you. Some people say that this is a gift. Others would say that this is a message from another world. A safekeep from the ether. You said this is destiny. But I say this is a curse. You're talking nonsense. It's as if you're not living in the real world. Let's go home together. Wait here, let me change my clothes. You need to have a discussion with Steven once in a while, Maya. Our relationship aren't affected by it. As long as Steven's quietness is not because he's suppressing his feelings. Steven also thinks that my "other" side... ...is nothing extraordinary. Maya... ...I have something... ...that could help you summon somebody's spirit. Are you sure? What's wrong with that? Is it odd that I suddenly have an interest towards these things? You're there, and I'll be here. It's opened. Do you have a guest? You don't have to wait if you'd like to eat now. Will this take longer? Why don't I feel anything? If only I was present at the last moment of your death. I really regret... ...being at her side at that moment. I was too selfish as a sister. Who would have thought? That moment was the last time we'll ever be together. I'd like to make sure... ...whether she's still angry with me or not. Are you ready? Apparently she's still angry. This takes time. I shouldn't have done this, Maya. You asked for this, didn't you? Well, I did. Are you regretting this? I'm scared. That's that, then. Thank you. Will you still be long? Just a little longer. I'll sleep now, okay? Nothing's here. Hello? Mr Rizal. Really? I don't know. I'll try. Okay. You're welcome. Mr Galang is my friend from the police force. Yesterday, he received a report of a missing child. I was then reminded of you, Maya. So, we'd like to ask for your assistance... ...in finding the missing child. The girl has been missing for two days. I borrowed this headband from her family. Is she still alive? I haven't received any visions for the time being. But, if I may suggest... ...please don't put too much expectations on myself. If you don't mind, you may keep the headband. I don't think that's necessary. I mean, perhaps this headband may help you find her. This afternoon, Rizal and a cop came to talk to me. A cop? About what? There's a missing child and they asked me to help them find her. You see? Your sixth sense finally could be useful. You think I enjoy this? What is it, Honey? It's nothing. Whose headband is this? Is it yours? No, it's that missing girl's. Are you okay? That child is around here. Just try to open the trunk. -What? -Open it! Hurry! They lock is broken. Just try to open it. This is the missing girl. Are you sure? Yes! I saw the photo, Steve! How did she get here? Maya, why are you looking at me like that? Don't get any ideas! -Let's just call the police first. -What would you say? Obviously to tell them that the girl is in my trunk! What if the police suspects you? Do you know the girl? -Do you know her? -I know nothing about that child! So what should we do? Let's call the ambulance instead. What would you say? She's dying, Maya. Bring her upstairs! I thought I heard a child's voice. -Where? -From here. Maybe you're mistaken. Maybe. Aren't you going to the cafe? Later. Let's go out. I'm sorry, I can't. Steven is here. Isn't he supposed to be working? Hold on. What is it? -Okay, just calm down. -How can I? This house can be the talk of the neighbourhood, Steve. We'll get into trouble. What is really on your mind? What is on my mind? I'm tired of living a difficult life. I just want to be happy. Keeping the child would complicate things instead. Nobody should know about the well-being of the girl. Sometimes, I wonder... ...am I supposed to always live like this? I just want to see... ...a little bit of light... ...to change our lives for the better, Steve. Fine. Let's deliver the girl to her house tomorrow night. -Sir. -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon. -I apologize... ...for coming without previously notifying you. It's okay. Please, come in. Thank you. About the condition of the girl... ...I still cannot provide a clear information on that... ...because I haven't been able to see any "signs". I also have children, Miss. I share the anxiety the parents are feeling. Do you know... ...that hundreds of children are recorded missing in a year. Their fates are yet to be known. I cannot provide any information yet, but I will try. Very well. I shall excuse myself, then. -Who was it? -Mr Galang. The policeman who asked my aid in finding the missing child. What did you say to him? I cannot tell him anything. I just can't wait anymore. I hope this can be resolved quickly. So do I, Maya. She's dead. It's all over now. Are you okay? That girl has returned to our house. She would appear... ...anywhere. She's there. She's there. Everywhere. Just like flecks of dust. Just like a broken wing of a sparrow... ...cold in the middle of a snowfall. Just like a broken compass. To the destination. To the place it must return. Just like a longing... ...which is unfulfilled even when its breath has ran out. Just calm down, Maya. Everything will be fine. This thing shouldn't have happened, Maya. I can't bear to see you suffer... ...because of something bad such as this. I'm only trying to make you happy. Even with all of my limitations... ...I'd like to see you happy. Just hang tight. Everything will be alright. I need to drop by the house. I need to get my camera. I need to take photographs for a documentation. Can't it wait? No, today's the deadline. Just relax, nothing will happen. Maya. Maya! Maya! Maya! -Hello? -I have no other choice, Steve. Maya, where are you? I can't keep going on like this. Maya, where are you? In the police station. What the hell are you doing there? We could never have peace, Steve. Wherever we go... ...and hide, still... ...we would return to the same point. I need to know the truth. I can't take it anymore, Steve. Maya! Maya! We can begin now. That day... ...I received a sign... ...regarding the location of that child... Apparently... Apparently, that child... ...was in Steve's trunk. We panicked. Afraid. What went through our minds at that moment... ...was to hide her... ...and return her to her house. But everything got out of control. So, what happened next? Sir! Miss Maya! Let my wife go! She's innocent! He's evil! -Steve! Calm down! -Shut up! Murderer! He's evil! -Miss Maya! -You evil man! Let go! -Miss! -Maya! -Maya! -Miss Maya! Maya! Maya, don't! Let go! Miss Maya! Maya. Miss! -Arrest him! -Yes, sir! Operating Room You're okay, aren't you, Maya? For the time being, Steve is considered as a person of interest by the police. But you don't need to worry. Just rest, Maya. Dian. Please find out the location of that child's burial. Otherwise, that child's spirit would never find peace. Dian. There's something I'd like to tell you. I'll go then, Maya. Life is unfair. All the happiness that I had expected from a marriage... ...constantly eludes me. Why do I have to experience a problem like this? I lost everything. I'm shouldering the consquences. There's one thing I'd like to ask you. Why do you believe so strongly that the spiritual world exists? If refuse to believe in the spiritual world... ...then who created us?
