Alcatraz, "the cliff". The world's most infamous prison. Alcatraz was the perfect prison for that time. The worst ones like Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly and Whitey Bulger- - put everyone imprisoned here. The island is less than two kilometers -but it was almost impossible to escape. Those who tried encountered icy water, streams- -thick fog and life-threatening predators. To investigate this, the plug on the seabed has now been removed- and drained the San Francisco Bay Area. The secrets of the seabed are revealed with incredible computer graphics. Can the landscape explain Alcatraz's reputation as escape safe? In 1962, three men broke out of Alcatraz. If the bay is drained, can you find out what happened to them? They went in on the north side of a raft and have not been seen. Did they reach the mainland and the freedom? Or did the violent currents seal their fate? And can the landscape explain why Alcatraz is the safest place- - When will the next earthquake hit California? What secrets are revealed when we drain Alcatraz? THE TRUTH ABOUT ALCATRAZ The island of Alcatraz lies alone in the middle of the San Francisco Bay Area A large body of water on the west coast of the United States. In the dramatic landscape lies Alcatraz and the remains- -after the prison just under two kilometers from the city center. For 29 years, some of history's most dangerous prisoners sat here. Alcatraz was the terminus. It was designed that way. That was where they could isolate the troublemakers. and the gangster kings, the most problematic. The worst prisoners were sent to Alcatraz. Officially, no one managed to escape from the "cliff". But exactly why did no one manage to escape from Alcatraz? To get an answer, we use high-resolution sonar- -to explore the hidden depths of San Francisco Bay. For the first time, high-tech computer graphics are used- -to produce incredible images of the bottom. This is how you've never seen Alcatraz before. Today, the island is a museum run by the park administration. Over a million visitors come each year. A man has seen it turn into one of America's most popular attractions. Ranger John Cantwell has worked on the island for over 25 years. He knows its history. At Alcatraz, we say history warehouse. The first layer is when the army was on Alcatraz. They arrived in 1853 and built a fort to protect the harbor. The Federal Prison Bureau took over in 1934 and operated it for 29 years. -as a high-security prison. American justice reserved Alcatraz for the very worst. The prison was fortified so that they could stay there. I'm in "Broadway" which is the main corridor of the cell house. A high security prison is very safe. There was a guard of three prisoners. They were monitored around the clock. They counted each prisoner twelve times a day. Those who tried to escape were severely punished. But fleeing was always a temptation. Freedom was just a short swim away. The worst thing about sitting here- -was the view of what was going on on the other side. Everything is clearly visible and the prisoners could see it. It is probably fair to say that everyone who sat here -thought about how they would escape. Freedom seemed so close that for some it was irresistible. The official escape attempts are 14- and five of them have still not been found. To get off the island, prisoners must first escape- -out of the prison itself. One of the most famous escape attempts is when Roe and Cole tried in 1937. They went out the windows and jumped into the bay. They sent out boats to search but they were never found. The official explanation is that they were washed out to sea. Strong currents were just one of the many dangers. It was popularly said that dangerous sharks swam in the bay. In 1959, a college student had been killed by a great white shark in these waters -and 2015, the legend of Alcatraz sharks was confirmed in pictures- -when tourists witnessed a great white shark attacking a seal off the island. But fear of sharks did not stop the escape attempts. And it got easier as Alcatraz began to fall apart. The complex aged. The concrete began to crack and fall apart. Steel rusts. It is almost impossible to be completely escape safe. Last year before the prison was closed- -took two incredible escape attempts. In December 1962, two men went down to the water. John Paul Scott and Darl Parker escaped through the basement of the prison. They sawed their way through a reinforced window. Out the window and up for some pipes. Then they ran over the roof of the cell house and - came down the west wall of Alcatraz. Then down the road and jumped into the water. They found Darl Parker standing on the cliff -which was called Little Alcatraz 50 meters out there. He waved to the guard and shouted, "Come and get me!" But they found John Paul Scott away at the Golden Gate Bridge. John Paul Scott is the only one officially- -has managed to swim across the bay- -but he was so exhausted that he was quickly returned to Alcatraz. It was an escape attempt until 1962- -which is the most famous of all. Three prisoners, Frank Morris and the Clarence brothers- -and John Anglin planned his escape for months. They managed to get off the island on a homemade raft. But they have never been found. The case is still open. They were believed to have drowned. It's one of Alcatraz's great mysteries. Can Morris and the Anglin brothers be the only ones who made it? Alcatraz was closed in the spring of 1963. Officially, no one managed to escape from there. But the strength of the prison can not be explained- -just with how thick the walls were. Or how vigilant the guards were. The waters around the cliff were also a deadly barrier during an escape. Now science can explain how and why the bay was so dangerous. Imagine being able to pull the plug on the bottom of the bay- and drain the water around Alcatraz. For the first time, we combine sonar with HD- -and high-tech computer images to reveal- seabed and stunning scenery. Finally, we have a clear picture of Alcatraz. A cliff rising from San Francisco Bay. It is isolated but clearly visible from land. You can touch it -but it's two kilometers out. When the bay is drained, Alcatraz is revealed as a cliff- -which rises from the seabed. It is surrounded by mountain peaks. All these ancient mountains were created by earthquakes. Tom Parsons is a geophysicist at the U.S. Survey. He has been studying the field for decades. We're at the Golden Gate and we're standing on the mountain which was formed a hundred million years ago. The San Andreas and Hayward faults -makes sure there is movement between- -the two plates here. San Francisco is right on the edge of the North American plate. When the Pacific plate is scraped against it- -it's getting anxious along all the fault lines here. Partly at Hayward and especially at San Andreas. The region is unstable with major earthquakes. In 1906 and 1868 there were devastating earthquakes in San Francisco. The nightmare-like effects of the 1906- earthquake -who measured 7.9 on the Richter scale is a reminder of how geology- - threatens the existence of the beautiful city. 100 million years ago, the landscape was very different. There was a third record between the two big ones called Farallon. It was located between the Pacific Ocean and North America. It was printed under North America throughout that time. When Farallon moved, the Gulf of San Francisco was created- and Alcatraz when ground under the North American plate. The process is called subduction. When Farallon disappeared, fragments from the earth's crust were forced- -upward, creating a valley and mountains. Alcatraz was part of the coastline that was lifted by the subduction. Back then, the bay was a long wooded valley with many high mountains. One of these mountains was Alcatraz. 10,000 years ago, the last ice age ended. The whole area was submerged in billions of liters of water. It created what we call the San Francisco Bay Area. Alcatraz became an island. This photo from 1853 shows the top of the submerged mountain- -like a contourless rock in the middle of the bay. Alcatraz may look peaceful and isolated. But it is surrounded by mighty forces of nature. By draining the bay, we can explain the island's deadly reputation- -and what may have happened during the escape in 1962. We're pulling the plug in San Francisco Bay and emptying it- -to discover why it was so dangerous to escape from Alcatraz. In three decades, there have been 14 daring escape attempts. The story behind one of them is legendary The most famous escape attempt is probably the one that took place in 1962. Frank Lee Morris, and brothers Charles and John Anglin - made a bold attempt to achieve freedom. The escape attempt was very ingenious. They stole lots of different things- -like dozens of raincoats, glue, and engines to make drills from. They even made a periscope, and a flashlight. Homemade tools were used to get through the walls. Here sat one of the brothers and they were skilled enough- -to create a portal at the back. They built a drill of a vacuum cleaner motor -and put a diamond on top and made small holes in the concrete- -to dissolve it around the ventilation. Doll heads were made of hard material -with glued human hair and painted faces. So at night they seemed to be sleeping in their cells. In the cell house, the light goes out at 21:30. That was when they broke out. When the heads are in place, they rise to the roof. -and has between 21:30 and 6:30 to get to the mainland. With over 50 glued together raincoats- - they make a makeshift raft and life jackets. It is their lifeline to freedom. They carry everything over the roof and drag it down to the water. Right here they went into the water. Morris and the Anglin brothers came down here. They dragged down their raft and filled it with air here. Then they jumped in and disappeared into the night. They searched the water for the three men -but neither the raft nor they were found. The official FBI documents state that the men and the navy- -believably pulled out to sea. The bodies were never found. But was that really what happened? Did they disappear at sea? Or could they have gone to the mainland? To understand the fate of refugees on the navy- -students study the geology of the bay itself. Can the seabed provide an answer? First, Patrick Barnard from Surveying- -examine the underwater landscape in the bay opening. An analysis of the seabed can explain the strong currents- -which surrounds Alcatraz and makes escape attempts so dangerous. Today we map from Golden Gate and west. Interesting to see what is on the seabed there. For the first time, multi-beam plumbing is used to see- -how the seabed itself may have affected the fate of the prisoners. The fantastic with multi-beam plumbing -is that they capture the bottom in HD so we get sound every meter- -and can see in incredible detail what the seabed looks like. Advanced technology sends thousands of sound waves to the seabed. The waves are reflected against the contours and give an unmatched overview. The investigation begins under San Francisco's most famous landmark. We are right below the Golden gate at the narrowest part of the strait. The purple shows the deepest parts of the canal. It's about 92 meters deep here. After several passages through the canal, a strange landscape can be seen. We see a bottom without direct features. The entire middle part of the sweep is ground down bedrock. When the water is emptied under the Golden Gate, a huge gorge is revealed. Much deeper than the rest of the bay. Deep enough to house a thirty-story house. But what happens to the seabed when you move west towards the sea? We are now a little more than a mile west of the Golden Gate -but the bottom is still empty and mostly bedrock. As the boat moves further away from the Golden Gate, the water becomes shallower. The sonar shows a dramatic change in the seabed. That is changing, we see much more sediment at the bottom here. When the water is drained, an incredible sight is revealed. We're starting to see some very large sand waves here- -which arose in the depths of the Golden Gate Strait. These formations on the seabed are enormous. The largest sand waves are 200 meters long - and 6 meters high. The highest is 10 meters. They're just a few feet from the harbor entrance. It looks almost like walking through the Sahara. The sand waves are formed when the tide rushes through the strait. Water that rushes forward carries with it sand which it then releases. The sand waves are there because it is a large estuary- -and all tides, about two trillion liters of water- - rushes through every time. Strong tidal forces force the water through the narrow channel. The solid bedrock at the gorge does not erode. The strait acts as a fire hose when the water rushes through. The flow is 160 times greater than the volume of water- -which flows over Niagara Falls. All sand and gravel is dragged along and forced through the opening- -and when the opening gets bigger and bigger- -it falls to the bottom. The drained landscape shows how the geology of the seabed- -shapes powerful tidal currents in the San Francisco Bay Area. The deep ravine acts as a funnel. To the west beyond the bridge, the seabed rises- -from about 90 meters deep to only 40 meters. We see how the rushing current dumps thousands of tons of sand -and creates huge sand waves that are up to ten meters high. But what has the underwater landscape at Golden Gate- -to do with fleeing Alcatraz? These tides were tamed by the prisoners as they fled. Could Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers have been caught in the currents? The report from the FBI investigation 1962- -shows that the tide in June 1962- -between 21 in the evening and 3 in the morning, strong tides were on their way out. The highlight came at exactly 23:46. So when were the prisoners in the water on their homemade raft? From the time the light went out, which was 9:30 p.m. - they left the cells as soon as they could. Say one to one and a half hours -to get everything through the valve on the roof- -about the roof, down the side, down into the water. I think they started paddling -as soon as they were in the water. I'm guessing at 11pm. The three prisoners should have been in the water when it was tidal. It was low tide then, the water was on its way out. What chance did they have if their raft of raincoats fell apart- -so they got to swim in the strong currents? If you tried to escape via the north side of the island when it is ebb- -as in 1962, the currents were extremely strong- -and went straight into the sea. It is difficult to swim out, within an hour and a half - could you be out on the coast. So Morris and the Anglin brothers had to fight against- -the deadliest currents in the bay. And the currents show no mercy. They have destroyed ships far larger than rafts. San Francisco Bay is a shipyard. When the bay is drained, a deep ominous gorge is revealed- -under the Golden Gate and huge sand waves- -which rises from the seabed. Huge amounts of water rush through the bay opening. Four miles east of the Golden Gate- -locates Alcatraz. This is a good example of the tide here. The tide holds about five knots. You can swim from Alcatraz to the mainland. But only during the short periods when the tide turns- and the currents slow down. I swam here when it was calm- and would never try to take me to San Francisco. Wild currents were just one of the prisoners' challenges- -when they tried to escape. There were other deadly dangers. Bill Baker is one of the few Alcatraz prisoners still alive. He was sent to Alcatraz for a three-year sentence in 1957- -after trying to escape from other prisons. But fleeing Alcatraz was something completely different. I thought about it but I did not think- -how to win over the water. The water is icy cold. The water is the wall that kept us here and it killed many -who tried to escape so it becomes- -very ugly after watching it for a while. The icy water that scared Bill Baker- -created by cold currents from the deep sea. They replace the hot surface water that is constantly whipped- -of the strong winds of San Francisco Bay. The average temperature is between icy 10 to 15 degrees. Under these conditions, anyone gets chilled quickly. When the cold water meets the hot air- -creates a new killer who silently invades the bay - fog. Thick fog can be a prisoner's friend and hide an escape. In 1937, two men escaped from the workshop when it was foggy. They calculated the time so they had -45 minutes lead on the guards- -before anyone noticed that they were gone. For Ralph Roe and Ted Cole, the fog offered protection as they left the island. But it was also a threat. If someone tries to escape into the misty bay- -then it will be almost an impossible situation. Very dangerous, confusing. That's probably the worst case scenario to try to escape. Jan Null knows all about fog. He's been a meteorologist in San Francisco for many years. But why is fog so common right here? The mechanism that creates our classic fog is -circulating sea breeze. When the air flows over the very cold water along the coast- -becomes the condensation that turns into fog that goes inland. There's only one way for fog to get into San Francisco. The only place with water it can get through is the Golden Gate. So there it will be mostly fog. It goes from the Golden Gate towards the Alcatraz -and then on to Berkeley. When Roe and Cole escaped, they quickly disappeared into the thicket. It was December and cold. An eyewitness saw them. He saw them in the water swept out. 99.9 percent chance that they did not make it. The thick fog made a rescue operation impossible. Roe and Cole were never seen again. The FBI thought they had died in the icy water. San Francisco fog combined with fast currents -is a recipe for disaster. By draining the water, we can see the result of this. There are large spooky figures scattered on the seabed. Dozens of shipwrecks. San Francisco Bay is a cemetery for missing ships. There's one just east of the Golden Gate- -long down the gorge with a tragic story. The shipwreck is called City of Chester. But how did this end up? August 1888 City of Chester is moving towards the Golden Gate Strait. In August it is thick fog here. It was foggy, and she was going out through the Golden Gate -while a large ocean steamer enters. It was much bigger. And much faster. Now, 130 years later, the historian Steve Haller- and archaeologist Peter Gavette in search of the missing ship. The City of Chester sank rapidly and it was about -60 meters deep. We're just above her now. The multi-beam plumbing gives a tickling glimpse of the sunken ship. -You can see the structure. -This is the bow. That the City of Chester has not been covered by sediment is great. With this data, we can see the wreck as it looked. With the data from the scan- - we can drain the wreck of the City of Chester. Can you determine how the disaster happened? One can see exactly where the decisive blow was -and you can see how this section is skewed- -compared to the rest of the ship, so the keel was broken off. The drained ship is the crime scene. The evidence is clear. We can see where it hit exactly aft on the port side- files about the shoulder and was divided almost into two parts. In the thick fog is the City of Chester and an ocean liner -in collision course. They did not see each other until it was too late. Strong currents drive them towards each other. City of Chester turns and Oceanic hits her in the side. The much heavier vessel punches holes in the hull. The smaller ship is mortally wounded. City of Chester drops in just six minutes- and 16 people die. She's just one of many wrecks on the bottom of San Francisco Bay. The result of the extreme forces that make the bay so dangerous. The same forces that those who tried to escape from Alcatraz encountered. The most famous are Frank Morris and the Anglin brothers -which fled on June 11, 1962. What chances did they have under these conditions? If you keep in mind that two large ocean -can be tossed around and one of them almost halves the other- -what chances do three guys have in a homemade rubber raft? But can the strong currents in the bay- -Instead of having helped the escapees? Could they have been taken to land and to freedom? In 1962, three prisoners embarked on a legendary escape -from Alcatraz in a homemade raft. Since then, there have been many rumors about their fate. Some claim to have seen them on land. But that contradicts the official FBI report- -that means they were on their way to Angel Island. It is located three kilometers north of Alcatraz. They did something no one else could do, they left the island -with a lead and was never seen again. The official report on the three men -says the raft took in water in the San Francisco Bay- and that they were cooled and taken out to the Pacific Ocean. But it has never been proven. When the news spread around the world, many became very imprisoned. It seemed to be the first successful escape from prison. For several weeks, the FBI searched the bay. -with the goal of finding them, dead or alive. It's the largest hunt in San Francisco's history. Even though they never found any traces of the bodies- - FBI found traces of the escape. They found two of the life jackets. They found two paddles in plywood -which floated in different places in the bay. Another life jacket was found outside the Golden Gate -on a beach just north. There was clear evidence of the escape. Evidence was available throughout the bay -but there were no traces of the men. How did it happen? Could the three escapees have done it? Is there a possibility that the currents helped them- -and brought them to the beach? Patrick Barnard and his colleague Josh Logan- -examines this fascinating theory. They use high-tech buoys with gps to follow the currents. The circumstances are very similar -as they were on the run in 1962. It's ebb now. The water moves at one and a half meters per second. The GPS measures the position every five seconds. We get it on our laptop and can follow it in real time. Then we get to know the direction and speed of the water. Okay, now we're tracking. I put in the buoy. The buoy is laid north of Alcatraz -on the refugees' road to Angel Island. At first, the buoy's trajectory seems to confirm the theory -that the men were pulled out to sea. It operates at about 6 kilometers per hour now. In a quarter of an hour we have driven halfway between Alcatraz and Golden gate. It seems to lie in the middle of the Golden Gate Strait. Despite a strong headwind, the currents pull the buoy out to sea. But then the unexpected happens... It did six kilometers per hour until the current took it. Then it slowed down to one kilometer per hour. The buoy stops just before the Golden Gate Bridge. It's unexpected. It seems to have slowed down -because it ended up in a vortex. It's quite interesting. It went southwest in a straight line. -until it slowed down in the vortex and changed direction. A vortex is created by water moving in circles- -almost like a slow whirlpool. Can a drainage of the San Francisco Bay- -discover what creates such a huge vortex? Just east of the bridge is something strange on the seabed. Away at the Golden Gate, it is shallow in some places due to -a large rock slab there. It forces the water upwards and creates this vortex. The deep undercurrents go straight into the bedrock- -forcing the rushing water to the surface. It creates the huge vortex that makes the buoy stop. A drainage of the bay reveals how powerful currents- -on the surface, which has killed humans, is created in the depths. Other strange phenomena at the bottom explain the deadly outcome- -from a previous escape attempt. Burglar Aaron Burgett fled- - against freedom in September 1958. His friend Bill Baker was a prisoner at the same time. He was a young man and he was strong. He was as strong as a donkey. Burgett overpowered a guard and jumped into the water- -on the west side of Alcatraz. They did not know where he had gone and locked us all up. There were boats circulating around the island both night and day. -with headlights and for every day- -which passed we became more optimistic. Despite the prisoners' hopes -founded Burgett two weeks later. One day his body was flushed up and then it was over. I was sad because I really wanted him to do it. Strangely enough, Burgett's body was found -just meters from Alcatraz. So why was he not taken out to sea by the strong currents? This may be due to the shallow water around Alcatraz. They have never been examined before. Now Professor Rikk Kvitek from Monterys University uses- -a unique surveillance vehicle to survey the terrain. It is designed to get where other vehicles cannot. It moves in shallow water and is equipped -with the same kind of sonar as others, but can be handled by one person. After one day of scanning -along the western cliffs- - Kvitek can explain what happened to Aaron Burgett's body. The drained lake bottom around Alcatraz shows dozens of -large rocks and caves. When Burgett drowned, his body probably sank to the bottom- -and got stuck among the rocks. When it broke down, gases were created that caused it to float. The 1962 refugees did not try to swim towards freedom. They made a raft. But if they disappeared into the sea or went to safety- is a big mystery. Patrick Barnard and Josh Logan hope to confirm- -how the seabed in the bay affects the currents above. They want to determine what course the refugees took in 1962. The first buoy stopped in a large vortex. They lay two other buoys in different places- - along the road to Angel Island. We put it a little further north than we put the other. The two buoys begin to move toward the Golden Gate. The second ends up in the same vortex as the first- -but the third continues straight towards the bridge. This one is on its way out and will not end up -in the same vortex as the others. Just a moment later, it has crossed the bridge. The third buoy has gone straight into the main canal- -and increased in speed. The drained seabed shows why the buoy is moving southwest. When it flows slightly north- -it takes over the rock and misses the vortex. Then the currents carry it through the gorge and under the Golden Gate. Soon the buoy is out at sea. It was out for about an hour and covered 6.8 kilometers. -with a maximum speed of ten kilometers per hour. It is about as expected. I was surprised by the others. They got stuck but this one just went -as the model predicted at ten kilometers per hour- -which is far faster than anyone can swim. Getting caught in the vortex would probably not have saved the escapees. They had to fight against strong currents to survive. Anyone trying to paddle in land -had probably ended up sideways. The test with the buoys sheds new light on the 1962 FBI report The two buoys in the vortex moved in different directions -and unbelievably, one moved back against Alcatraz. It may explain why remnants of the fleet- -found near the island after the escape. The third buoy shows that if the prisoners drowned- -as the FBI thought, the bodies would have been taken out to sea. One thing that the test really shows- - is that San Francisco Bay is unpredictable. The currents are so complex that you can a few meters in one direction and end up- -in completely different places. Ten kilometers out to sea or back on Alcatraz. But if the three prisoners reached the open sea- -there was another deadly threat in the form of large numbers of great white sharks. The area is called the Red Triangle. In June 1962, it was the same kind of season as now. With a lot of nutrition in the water. Lots of fish, so there should have been many more great white sharks -in the area than the rest of the year. If they made it all the way here, dead or alive- -so they may have fallen victim to great white sharks. The three prisoners were never found. But research shows that they are unlikely to succeed. The infamous prison was closed in 1963 without any remarks. Officially, no one managed to escape from Alcatraz, despite many attempts. It was the surroundings that made it safe to escape. The bay was the perfect prison wall. It can be said that the bay has created the reputation of Alcatraz. The "perfect prison" was the result of unusual geology. Deep ravines, huge dunes, hard cliffs- in the Golden Gate Strait, strong currents and large predators- -waiting in the water outside the bay. Natural phenomena that made the rock "impossible" to escape from. But there is another powerful force of nature in the bay- -which surpasses ocean currents. A drained Pacific Ocean reveals the first clue. Deep underwater off San Francisco- - lies the infamous San Andreas Fault. The moving tectonic plates have created major earthquakes. The deadliest occurred in 1906. More than 3,000 people died. But can an even worse earthquake occur here? The so-called "big one"? We have predicted an earthquake- -which can start in the far south of San Andreas- -and walk all the way north along the bay- -and involves the whole area. It would be 8.2 to 8.4 on the Richter scale. The devastation would be much greater- -until the earthquake of 1989. If such an earthquake affected the San Francisco -would there be many casualties, many buildings collapse- and motorways and infrastructure are shut down. The destruction would affect the city -the whole bay and the whole of California. The earthquake would cause parts of the city to collapse into the sea. Large parts of the city center would be destroyed. Golden Gate might not work. But when the smoke dissipates, a place would remain. Alcatraz would be safe to -it's a solid rock. It would not collapse like soft earth. It has existed for 100 million years and would withstand an earthquake. If the geologists are right and when the San Andreas cracks, Alcatraz is the safest place, ironically. The island that so many men wanted to escape from - offers a sanctuary. By draining Alcatraz and revealing the seabed's secrets- -shows a different picture of the island. The explanation behind the secrets- -involves more than just prison. The Geography of the San Francisco Bay Area -water, cliffs, wind and fog form a net- -which makes Alcatraz impossible to escape- -if "the big one" does not occur. By draining the waters around Alcatraz- -the secrets of the cliff have been revealed.
