Oh there's no room. - I got it. - [Barry] It's a little tight there. - Sorry. - [Barry] Slide on in here Brit. - [Junior] Slide right on in. - Why do I feel like I'm in between a rock and a hard place? - Well, I don't know about the rock but I can definitely tell you about the-- - Dad, haven't you ever heard about sexual harassment in the workplace? - Heard about it? I invented it. - [Brit] Oh God. (Brit gagging) - Can you tell me where we are? - No I'm sorry, no Ingles. - Hey, here she is. - Hi, excuse me, can y'all tell me is this Miami or Chicago? - [Junior] This is Miami. We're from the agency. - Hi. - Hi, how you doing? Do you have a name? - Babs. - [Barry] Babs? Why don't we make that Boobs? - Cool it Dad. - No, Babs. - Lemme get that for you. - Babs is fine, Babs will do. - Why don't you and your friends hop on in. - Hi, y'all. - [Girls] Hi. - [Junior] Give it a rest. - [Girl] Hi. - Okay, settle in. We're off to see the wizard. (birds chirping) - Well here we are, at the mansion. - Home sweet home. - [Barry] Home sweet home. (upbeat rock music) - Juan. - Hey, senor Barry. You going to take care of me, eh? If not, I'm going to tell the big one. - Girls this is the B And B Models corporate yacht. Pretty hot. This is the pool heated in the winter and cooled in the summer. Girls these are the tennis courts. Feel free to use them anytime. Nice shot, Dad. Girls this is the hot tub. Try to avoid going in there during feeding time. Trust me on that. Hey, Dad living large huh? Girls, this is it. - Wow. - [Barry] This is your new home. - I love it. - [Barry] It's huge isn't it. (girls chattering) (luggage falling) (models laughing) Get up you idiot. Girls this is my living room and it's your bedroom. - So where do we sleep? - Pick a couch, any couch will do. I want you to consider me your long lost uncle. I want you all to know that you can count on me, that there will always be an open bedroom door to my room. - And now the house rules are really basically simple. First, try to respect each others food, makeup, clothes, and privacy but secondly, and most importantly of all, no guys ever, never, ever, ever under any circumstances without exception, instant firing will follow. Don't even think about it. - What about bedroom checks? I think we should have bedroom checks. Absolutely, don't you think bedroom checks would be good? Yeah, we need that. - Dad, I know the girls are sexy but this is supposed to be a business. - Fine look, I'm the businessman here right? In this business we have an expression. It's called mixing business with pleasure. (intense upbeat music) (models chattering) (models laughing) - Hey, that's my bed. - Honey, I deserve the biggest and the best and the biggest is always the best in men and in beds. Get your stuff. (loud hammering) All right, you watch out bitch because I am going to be more famous than you. - And how are you gonna do that? - By sleeping with the right man of course. - (gasps) Sleeping with the right ... (scoffs) I'm gonna reach the top of the world by sleeping only with the man I intend to marry. (kissing loudly) - Intend to marry? Girl are you crazy? What if he has other plans? You know like loving you and then leaving you? - No, not my man. Believe me I can spot them. - Do you love him? I love him very, very much. - Then I think you ought to marry him and have babies right away. - [Model] What? - Did I say something wrong? - What do you do with all of this? - I use them. You see I'm going to be an actress. Modeling is only a step towards a silver screen for me. - What does modeling have to do with acting? - Directors sleep with models and until you go out with a director and sleep with him you'll never be an actress. So what are you doing here? - Some guy stopped me on the street in Surigao and offered me a ticket here. He never asked if I'd modeled before. - Oh, so have you? - No. - No? - No. - So, you've never modeled before? - No. - That's all right, we'll teach you. (models laughing) - Girls. Zinga bring the shaving cream. Babs bring your brassieres and bring stuffing, lots and lots of stiffing. It's all right we'll teach you. - Well first when go get a job it's called see go, go-see, and you have to dress up like a model. - You mean in high heels and a tight dress right? - No, no, no, no, no, forget that stuff. Trendy, funky clothes. Hop hip, hop rap, these clothes. - Yeah, yeah, and when you see someone you know, like a makeup artist or photographer, even if you don't remember their names they breathe all over you and they got really stinky breath you've got to go up to them you go, "Oh, it's so good to see you, oh!" (kissing loudly) Wow. - Oh God, and don't forget to tell them they look fabulous. - Oh yeah, you look great. - Even if you don't remember their names. - But what do I do if I get a job. - Ah, that's the easy part. Just act like a model. - And when you get a fashion show, it's called runway, okay. Now line up, line up. And this is what you do. Ready, boobs out, butt in, put your head up and cop a big attitude like Iman. Ready, and strut, strut, strut, strut and turn, okay, strut, strut, strut, strut and turn. Okay, now you try go ahead. Go strut, strut, strut, strut and turn. - [Model] Yes. - [Model] And strut, come on, strut, keep going. Strut, strut, and oh, good. - Was that good? - [Model] Oh it was great, beautiful, beautiful. (models clapping) (cat call whistling) - Hey, hey, now how's that for new talent? Check it out. - Whoo wee baby I feel a love thing coming on. - They're walking right past us and didn't even say hello, huh. - Hey, hey, I love you and you and you. Oh my God I think I'm gonna faint. - [Model] Miami Beach looks so small on here. - Oh, but that's because it's a map. It's much bigger in real life. - Hey, guys look there's Barry, come on. - [Model] Oh. - This is disgusting. - [Models] Ew. - How are ya? Good to see ya. Welcome to. - [Model] B And B Models. - Yes, that's right. Barry and Barry. (Barry exhaling) Buns and boobs. Whoo, I love this business. (upbeat music) (models chattering) - [Junior] Oh hey girls. - [Models] Hi. - Okay everybody line up. Zinga, eyebrows. I want those eyebrows plucked into a thin line. Otherwise, you're looking really good. And you, Brit, you have great skin tone but don't hide it under all that blush, you know just a little bet. Legs, Legs, don't show so much leg on go-sees. Make them ask to see those. No, make them beg to see those. Whoa, is that real? - But of course it is. - That watch is worth at least $5,000. - [Fab] So? - You know, if they think you're rich you won't work. - [Barry] Yeah, I'll take that. - Dad, Dad, I got it. Just take it off later. - Yeah, later. - Good, very good. No, sorry. (spitting) Ladies, you are on the hottest fashion scene on the planet. Right in the epicenter. I mean Claudia, Paulina, Naomi, they're all here. - So, how much money do we get? - Yeah, okay, let's talk about that. See this is how it works. First, we query up by the day. Unlimited mileage and unlimited cleavage, mm-hmm. Now, there is 20% that we take out for deductible. There's 18% for wear and tear, then of course, there's 45% to maintain this lavish palace, then of course, there's state and local taxes, there is tax, tag and title. Price is subject to change. Void where prohibited by law. Excuse me, any questions? Good, I didn't think so. Barry Junior. - Thank you Barry Senior. The bad news is girls, you're all gonna need new portfolios if you wanna work in this time. The good news is, I'm gonna show all your new pictures. - Yes but, there will be a small charge. - How small? - $500 per girl. - You've got to be shitting me. - Babs, high fashion models do not use the term shitting me. - I don't even have (speaking foreign language). - Don't worry girls, don't worry, we'll work with you, okay? Listen, you just pay us what you can for now, and we'll take the rest out of your residuals. - Along with the rent for the mansion. - [Models] Rent? - But don't worry, $500 an hour, you girls will be making that much money in no time at all. - [Model] All right. - Okay now everybody, let's go shoot your new pictures. (upbeat music) Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's looking good. Okay get it off the shoulder a little bit. There you go, oh this is good. (camera shutter clicking) Oh this is great, you can't screw this up. Give me the Twin Towers, come on give me some real estate. Don't worry, this will strengthen your thing. Oh yeah, oh yeah, come into me baby, lean into me. Looking good, oh yeah. Oh this is good, this is ...

Come up on the hair. - Ultimately you have to handle this. - [Loopi] Come up with the hair, I like it like this, pouf, pouf. - It looks like electric shock therapy. - [Loopi] We'll try dreadlocks later. - Go on. - I don't know, maybe, maybe not. No, it's big hair, that's what it is. Lackluster really. Knock that off. - Loopi. - You look like funny name man, the bald headed TV, Luke Perry. You know I think maybe perhaps, maybe we do the tuck, tuck. - Loopi, you are the one who said no tuck, tuck. - [Loopi] Okey-dokey, no tuck tuck. - Get in here, what-- - I got it, I got it. - Let me see that. - I can't believe it. - Hmm. - This is good. - We're in business. - [Junior] Here are your new go-see lists girls. I made copies for each one of you. - And here are your new portfolios. - [Junior] And you'll notice that I'm using an avant garde, nuevo art deco style, which Helmut Newton and I are at the cutting edge of this new look. I think you'll really like 'em. - Yes, and as the cop on the TV says girls, go out there and get 'em, before they get you. - [Model] Helmut, don't you think this is a little too much? - [Helmut] No, no, no touch, no touchy here. (workers chattering) I'm shooting from the ground up and the sunlight is coming into the shadow, hello. - [Loopi] Who is this person? - Yeah, I'm wondering about this myself. - Is this for models, ya. - No, it's a dog show stupid. (everyone laughing) - [Helmut] And she has a sense of humor on top of it all. The sunlight is ... (girl screaming) Oh, oh my god, oh. - I hope your dogs can swim then. Now, where's the Queen Mother? - Hey boss, how you like my new look? I think we might be able to work with this, the wet look. - Good yeah, no out, no in, no out.

(groaning) Whoa. - See that was great. - [Junior] Yeah you are great. You know the problem is that your pair doesn't have any bounce. - What do you mean, I bounce. - Yeah, but not like the new ones do. You know, we gotta get you a new pair. - You Americans always want to replace everything, even breasts. - Hey, I wasn't talking about your tits. - Tits? - You know hooters. - Hooters? - Melons, gazongas, jugs, no cones, knobs, your breast, how 'bout breasts? I wasn't talking about your breast. - Would you like to? - Well, you know I gotta go to work. I'll see you later though. - Okay, later we'll talk about my breast. - [Man] You'll see, dogs really love that food. (dog growling) - Onie, be a good doggie, eat the dog food. Be a good dog. (screams) Bad doggie. - [Bass] Hey, you can't do that. - Ugh. (engine revving) - Is this a fisheye lens? It looks to me like a fisheye lens, Loopi. (upbeat cheery music) If I wanted a fisheye lens, I would ask for one, no? - No. - Yeah. - Si. - No, yeah. - I think a fisheye lens. - Now, where is the talent? Where is the talent? - Helmut. - Oh, wonderful. Take this trash off please, show us your bosom. Beautiful, yeah. - I know you. - [Brit] No you don't. You probably wish you did. - [Man] I'd remember that body anywhere. You and your friends just started working today. - That's right, how'd you know that? - It says so in the script. - Oh. - [Helmut] Yeah, I can see it, yeah good, yeah this is it. Yeah, oh yeah that's it. Ooh, ooh, I really do look good today. Ah, okay, yeah. Just one more, next girl, next girl please, yeah. - Don't worry, I'll see you again. - [Helmut] Yeah, beautiful.

That stupid little dog tried to bite me. It wasn't my fault. - [Model] Hey. - Hi. - I found this wonderful new shop. Want to see what I bought? - [Model] Sure. - You know I couldn't find any of the places. - Hi everybody, I just signed for one of the commercials. Junior taught me how to be good. - [Model] I guess that means you didn't get the job. - [Man] Hey there. - What, hi. - [Man] I told you I'd see you again. - Are you following me? - [Man] Can I see your book? Who shot these things, Ray Charles? - Yeah, they're good, no. - Junior says they look like Helmut Newton. - Helmut Newton, no, no, fig newton, yes. (everyone laughing) - Don't laugh at my book. I have never been so incredibly insulted, so rude. - [Man] Hey, wait, just wait. - No, don't make fun of our books. - We can make it up to you okay. I live with these three other guys, and they were wondering if you girls would have us over for dinner tonight? - Yeah, you girls can cook the food, serve it to us, and clean up, while we drink beer and play volleyball, how about it. - What about the other two guys. - Are they good lucking too? - Shoot, I'd say we're good looking. - Okay, what do y'all want to eat? - Maybe a little sushi and some sashimi. And maybe a little Dom Perignon to wash it down. - Yeah, and then we can have some oysters on the half shell, maybe a little bottle of Chardonnay, some smoked salmon in there, and then we get up to main course. - Yeah. - Filet mignon's great this time of year with some artichokes, asparagus, you know we can have a couple of chocolate souffles and creme brulees, before we go on to the vintage ports and cognacs of course. - Ooh all right. - Okay, all right. - Great, well we'll see you girls tonight then. - [Model] All right. - All right, bye. - Forget about it, we give them beer and hotdogs. In the meantime, we've got some important business to discuss with our agency. - We can't get work with these pictures. Mine makes me look like a dumb blonde. - Me too. - Me too. - Me too, I want my old pictures back. - [Model] And I want my money back. - I like mine, I think Junior makes me chic, like Hollywood movie, and I like that. - Look, let me call you back.

As a matter of fact, it's kind of decent. I'm just doing my job. My job obviously is to give out tickets. Now let me see your IUD. - [Man] Officer, I'd like to report a crime in progress. - What are you talking about?

What, you don't want to work with the great Helmut on movie, no. You're looking here I see. There's another commercial you would like to be in perhaps, over there? Hmm, well what are you doing? Sit back down and you are grabbing balls. Will you hit anything, ooh incoming. Ooh, mm. - Yeah. - Hey balls, hey boss I meant. - Yeah. - I think I have a hot flash. - Of course you have a hot flash, the sun is shining. - No, no, no, a hot flash, a poof. - Oh, the hot flash. - Si, si. - And yeah, do you know why you have the hot flash? - I don't know why, but I think you're gonna tell me. - Because you are Italian. - Which one of you hags took my mousse? - Shut up. - [Girl] Those are mine! - [Model] No it's not. - You ate my cheese again. - It's mine, all mine. (girls arguing) - Stop. - All right, all right, that is enough. That's enough! Hold it, stop it. Now come here, come here you guys. Listen to me, now let's pretend we're adults and talk about this, okay. You see we're all fighting over nothing at all. What's really the problem? - The problem is, I haven't gotten paid for any of the work I did. - Me neither, and I have no money. - Yeah, well I just got a bill for rent from Barry, can you believe that guy? - Okay, then we all agree, enough is enough. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I think we should just quit the agency until they pay us. - Yeah, and pay us now. - Yeah. - [All] Yeah! (girls cheering) - Yeah, we will wrap up yoga commercial on Friday. We can't return that equipment until Monday. Ultimately, you're gonna have to have security. - Oh yes, yes. - And if you can get equipment, it will be Fuji stocks, or design bags for the models. (speaking foreign language) - Oh, where's my pen. - The set of TV, the rest of these things, yeah. Go to sleep, yeah, (speaking foreign language). That's good yeah. - Junior, what the hells all the commotion here? - Huh, we're making a movie. - Who's we, I see me and you knot head. What are you French now, oui, oui, you got a mouse in your pocket? - Oh Dad, Dad, you and me. I'm directing and you're producing from an original script by yours truly. If I could just find one we could shoot in two days. - So do you have one? - Oh here's one. A British Werewolf From Miami, what do you think? - A werewolf from Miami. - [Junior] Yeah. - Sounds like a story about Madonna. - Nah, she's totally for the part. But you know she does have hair in all the right places. - So what else you got there? - This is a good one. This one we can shoot in a weekend. It's about your life Dad, it's called Mr. Miami. - Uh-huh, I like the way that sounds. Let me take a look at that. - Nah, it's garbage. - What do mean it's garbage. - It's garbage, it's just garbage. Anyways, here it is, this is perfection. That is good. - Perfection huh? Ah, from Miami to Eternity, sounds like a classic. - Also known as Oscar's List. - [Barry] Hmm. - This is a film within a film, within a film. You see what I did was I ripped off the climax scenes of 40 Academy Award winning films and I wove them into this top script, spectacular cinematic images. - Hmm, climax scenes huh? Now that sounds interesting. (girls chattering) - We quit. - I hate you. - [Model] Swine. - Junior, how could you do this to me? - I'm tried of this rubbish, up your bum. - And we're gonna sue you for all you're worth. - Fine, see you in small claims court. (laughs) - Wait, wait, you girls haven't even heard about the feature film I've been asked to direct. - Yeah, the kid's got his big break. And he wants to make you girls stars. - Did you say stars? - I did. - You're lying. - Uh-huh. - Junior I'm so happy for you. - I'll tell you what, you girls show up at 8:00 a.m. Saturday morning and you'll see if we're lying to you. In the meantime I have a copy of the script for each one of you. - Yeah, so why don't you girls just take a script, any script, and memorize a part, any part. - And where's the money for this? - Oh is that what this is about, cash girls? - Well here you go, see. Hey, not so fast. You girls are what we moguls call, pay or play. That's right, you pay, we play. - Fab, here you go. You get to play that memorable role from Octagon, I mean Octopussy. And you, Cleopatra. - But I thought Cleopatra was Egyptian. - Well Cleopatra was Egyptian, but Elizabeth Taylor was British. And Zinga, you get to roll on the beach, sex on the beach. I hope it takes you from here to eternity. And Babs, you've used a gun before right? - Yeah. - Good, 'cause you're gonna get Bonnie and Clyde. - All right. - And Legs, fabulous Legs, only you could play that long-legged French Lieutenant, I mean his woman. (men sighing) That was really a close call. You know we really do have to pay them this time. - Oh yeah, well how do you expect us to pay them. You know we have to pay a film crew. You know what I'm talking about, those big guys with tattoos who set things up, break things down, snap people's necks, and breaks their knees. - I know, I know, I know. Screw the writers, screw the director, and-- - Yeah, but most importantly, screw the talent. (upbeat music) (man snoring) - You boys the weekend shift? - That's right, 10-4, over and out good buddy. - They say this stuff's worth over a million bucks. Stay away! - I think you had a little too much coffee there Bill! Hit the road, we got this baby covered. - Go home and feed the dogs Bill, we got it all, yee-haw.

All right. - [Junior] Well I'll be darn. - Whoo hoo, we hit the mother load Barry Junior. - If this stuff is worth a million bucks, you know we can get into some deep shit. - Big shit, trouble, heaps, mounds of it. - And action! Okay Legs, you're awfully close to the rocks. You're looking for your lover. You climb over these rocks, sand, grass, anything looking for him. The French Lieutenant is never coming back. You've got to make him wanna come back. Show him your tits. Okay let me see those tears. He didn't break daybreak. - Yeah, and he ate all your croissants too. - Dad, I am the director, nobody talks to the talent but the director. - You're right you are the director. - Thank you. - But nobody talks to the talent but the director and the director's dad. Now, act you bitch! - Oh this is great, this is great, keep rolling the film, she's committing suicide. (girls screaming) - Oh my God, oh my God, she's drowning, she's drowning! - Perfect, we won't have to pay her residuals. (upbeat music) (music drowning out speakers) - And action.

You're dying, and you're dead. Dad, Dad, what do you think? That was great. That was good. - It was good, but next time show us more tits. (relaxing music) - This is fantastic. You're in Venice, it's hot, you're dying. This is great. - Wrong, I'm in Miami Beach, I'm hot, and you're dying.

Don Sells, the Brothers Cohen, Spike Lee, you'll see, I'll be back. - Well folks, I guess that's what they call in this business a wrap. Yeah, hello. Wife Swapper, boy, have I got some girls for you. - No work. - At least you have a boyfriend. Junior won't even look at me. - Who would hire us now anyway, we're practically criminals. - Oh come on girls, maybe after this one, we'll all get work as an actresses. - Yeah and in the meantime where are our boyfriends? - Well the last time I saw Rod, he was chasing Legs. - [All] Yes. - He has the hots for Legs. - I have an idea where we can all have some fun and teach those guys a lesson they'll never forget. - What is it? - What? - First we get a video camera. - [All] Yeah. - And then ...

I mean, that's what friends are for. You know this could definitely use some adjusting. - [Model] Oh. - And this definitely has to come off. - [Model] Mm-hmm. - So does this. Slow down, your candid camera. Hey I was only trying to help her out. - I'll show you about being helpful. - Well I just don't know where Fab is, I mean she said she'll meet us here. I haven't see her. - Well that's all right, I'm kind of enjoying being alone with you. - [Model] Sting, you wouldn't cheat on Fab, would you? - Oh no, I'd never do that. But I feel like being alone with you. - [Model] Oh you naughty boy. Keep your hand just like that so Fab can focus the camera. - Ah ha, so that's how much a true Boston boy does it. - Oh shit. - Ooh Babs, those moves and my great body, we're gonna make one great couple. - You dance so well. - That's not all I can do. - Oh yeah, show me big guy. - Ooh, now feast your eyes on this. - Feast your eyes on this. - Well at least they're all consistent. - Ooh Eddie, it's so hot in here. - Here baby, let me cool you off. - Ooh, that's cold. - [Eddie] Well I can always lick it off for you. - Uh, uh, uh, uh, before you do that cowboy, I think you better smile for the camera.

There's some powder on it. - It's hard working money my friend. - Yes, I'm sure it is hard working money, it's gonna work very hard in my pocket. - Thank you bandero. - [Barry] Yeah and I'm back again. - I promise, I would never ever be, what ever the name in English is again. - The word is suckered. - Oh screwed. - You know, we really have had some wild times here, haven't we? - Guys, I think I'm gonna cry. - Come on, let's get on with our lives. - Yeah, I've got a plane to London to catch. - Maybe Junior needs a roommate. - Girls, I'm really glad I saw you. Boy, this is exciting. I got a shoot for you girls today. - Forget it Barry. - Hey listen, I've got 500 bucks right here, take a look, cash up front now and another 500 when you're done, at the end of the shoot. - What shoot? - I can't believe it. We're shooting a bridal gown catalog, right here in Barry's mansion. Now, as a matter of fact, here you go. We've got bridal gowns for everybody. Here you go Zinga. Oh, and there's a bonus. You girls can keep these when you're done too. And this is exciting too, they're made out of 100% acrylic. Which means they'll last longer than any marriage you will ever be in. - [Model] That's good. - Uh-huh, I knew you'd like that. So, there you go. Oh, and also, by the way, I need you to sign these releases. Here, pass 'em off, just go ahead. We can do this quickly, Barry has places to go. - Why does mine say marriage contract? And who is Shogun Manifooey? - Oh no the marriage contract, that's a misprint from another shoot. That is the name of the guy you'll be modeling with. Okay, so let's go. Come, come, come, down the stairs. Come on Zinga. Babs, Babs, everyone move along. (Barry shooing the girls) Change, good. - Have you seen Junior? - Legs, I've got a little Uncly Barry advice for you. I think you should forget about JR. You should be thinking about places like Abu Dhabi and Kuwait, he's a loser. You're much too much woman for him, and too tall. So go. - I'll never forget him. - Yeah you will, trust me. Yeah hello, Eurotrash Productions, I got a big fashion gig for that crowd photographer there. Yeah Helmut. And make sure they send along that cabin boy assistant of his. What's his name Snoopy, Droopy? No, no, no, Loopi. Yeah, make sure Loopi's there, bye. (laughing) (upbeat music) (birds chirping) (horn honking) (water splashing) (motor whirring) - Great, so my dad the rat is abandoned sinking ship. Man, I don't need this. You know, you're what's important to me and I didn't even know it. You're the only thing. Well at least the girls are working today. Shoot. (upbeat music) (camera shutter clicking) - First of all, let me tell all the ladies present today, God loves you, yes he does. - Ooh I love the hair. It sits right on top of the head with the curls coming down. - What magazine is this for anyway? - [Man] For the same magazine. - [Man] Deliver his look. - [Girl] Time. - If you know what I mean. - What do they care about fashion? - Enough pictures, enough pictures. - Oh enough from you, you Latin worm. - Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today to bury the dearly deceased. Wait a minute, you're getting married, am I right? Just a minute, let me find my place here. No, why, no. Oh, oh, there it is. Wind and more wind. - Hey Legs stop, it's a real wedding. - [Elvis] Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today. Bonsieur John. Business class, where is my chauffeur? - I swear I had nothing to do with it. - You had nothing to do with what? - I swear, I swear. - What do you doing? (men yelling) You know what, your mother was a dud. Nothing but a lousy little poodle, that's it. - Come on, let's get this over with. - And unless some son-of-a-bitch come forward and tells why. (yelling in foreign language) They should not be bound and gagged in holy matrimony. (yelling in foreign language) - Stop, it's a real wedding! - Then I hereby pronounce all of you, husband and ... (man yelling in foreign language) I take it you are the girl's father then? - Who are you? - [Helmut] What is this, I don't like surprises? My picture, it looks good. - Get away, imbeciles. - Barry sold you girls to these men. - What?, sold us? - Give me back my stick. - I have a contract with this woman man, is that a problem with that cockroach? - No, wait, wait, wait. I can refund all your money. - You better, or else. - [Helmut] All right, all right you pushed me. - Thank you very much - You pushed me too far, I'm calling my agent. - And I'm gonna call my bookie. - [Barry] Yes, love this boat. Love your new life Bar. You're big, huge. Bahamas, here we come. Broads, gambling, champagne. Man, living the good life, you deserve it. You're rich Barry, rich. Rich I tell you, it's mine, it's all mine. Mobs of money. - [Junior] Wait, let's just talk about this for a minute. - Hey you cockroach, you owe me $20,000 man. - [Junior] I'm sure we can negotiate something. - But what about our $500, Barry promised it. - This is bullshit. I'm calling the cops this time. - Stop being so mean to him, all of you. - Thank you, you're amazing. - [Barry] My money, my money, all my money. Fish are eating it, I'm gonna catch it and kill you and then eat you. My money, oh it's ... (phone ringing) - Yes, yes. Really, wait a minute, let me get this straight. You were at Paramount, but you left Paramount to go to Warner Brothers, but Universal's made you a housekeeping deal? Sure babe, we can cut a deal. We're making a deal. You want to deposit the money into my account? Oh I love you babe, you're the best. (everyone chattering) I, Junior, will refund all of your money gentlemen, 'cause I have just caught a six figure, plus royalty output deal. With a seven figure advance, yes. - The studio screwed Junior and denied the sequel. We all went home, still broke, but a little wiser. I stayed in touch with all the girls from that season. We all send these little videos to each other so we can keep up. Here's my collection. Hi girls, I'm a cowgirl now. (upbeat music) - [Model] Hey girls, I'm a princess now. - Hey everybody. - Hey everybody, it's me Legs. I was just practicing for my next film. It's sort of mine and Junior's number. - [Helmut] Do you know why you can't keep a generous mustache on? - [Loopi] I don't know why boss. Is it supposed to be this way with all this pressure? - Because you are Italian. - Si. - Rod actually became a veterinarian and does plastic surgery on poodles, we're rich. - Hey, we went to the Bahamas for Easter and guess who we caught on our video. (upbeat music) Check this out. - So you folks must be new here in town in the Bahamas. Yeah, what do want, a gambling jacket? Nah, I don't think so, probably honeymoon. I think you should get something for this little cutie over here. How 'bout this, beautiful, take a look at this preowned coconut. Is this a sight to behold, is this gorgeous? This is fabulous, this is for this woman. It's big, it's beautiful, all right a little beat up. I let that happen, what you got five years. It's a pretty good looking piece of coconut for five years. You, I got something for you beautiful. You guys are just married, take a look at this coconut. Only one year old. I'll give you something in a second you leech. Here you go, beautiful. What's your story, is this your friend? You couldn't get him a date? You should work on a date for him. Piece of coral for you. This is what you got your eye on, don't you young man? Yeah, how do you like that little baby? This is the best price point you'll find anywhere. Take a loot at that. All right you like the weight on that, don't you? Let me see what else you got here. You got your eye on anything else special? It all looks good to you? I think you want the big one, you want this big one. That fresh one doesn't look too good. You guys want to have matching coconuts don't you? Yeah, I think you want matching coconuts. (Multicom Jingle)
