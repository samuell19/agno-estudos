This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Kendra. Try one and be honest. Not fair. You know my sweet tooth can't say no to a00 a.m. cookie. I need to know if they're good enough to make for Jason's parents on Christmas Eve. Anything to help a friend impress her future in-laws. You hate it. No, no, no, Sarah. It's good. Just... maybe less peppermint? I think I ruined my tastebuds last night. I ate a dozen already. Don't tell your dentist boyfriend that. Oh, periodontist, and it was just one date. No sparks? Oh, no sparks, no butterflies, no skipped heartbeats. Plus, we'll never see eye to eye on my one true love... sugar. Are you ready for this meeting? I'm sure you'll get praise for your "30 Biggest Regift Fails" list. Did you see how many people already read it? Not enough for Linda to trust me. She'll come around eventually. She promoted me because she said she liked my vision for things, but the more time that goes by the further away this site gets from actual journalism. Why don't you just quit and go freelance? Pay is good and I know what to expect. Why risk that? Plus, if you left, you'd miss me too much. Well, yeah. That's mainly it. First off, just want to say, Kendra, great regift piece. So far, it's the highest-clicked list of the season! Peter, still getting great traction on your article from last month on the development heiress Sandra Evans. How a messy break-up leads to a thriving business. Gossip and advice... The best of both worlds. Would love to get a follow-up with her ex, see why he walked away from having it all? Apparently, he has fallen off the map. Keep looking. And as far as this month, our marketing team reports that the Friday before Christmas is the highest online traffic day of the season, so we need to get all our Christmas content up by then. That's the 22nd, people! So, let me hear some clickable Christmas ideas! Christmas cookie recipes to impress your in-laws? Personal, love it! Celebrity influencer slash rapper, Zigzag, is attempting to set the world record for largest national toy drive. How would you make a listicle of that? Oh, it would be more of a human-interest piece, an introspective on Zigzag's community relations and the labor required to organize a toy drive of that scale. I know you're itching to expand what we publish here at Quizzer, but I just don't think our audience wants to read about the ins and outs of organizing a toy drive. Now, if Zigzag was doing it to impress his ex, Carmella, that would work. Right, well, then how about... "what kind of elf would you be in the North Pole?" Perfect! Do that one. And don't worry, when the right story comes along, it'll be a go. All right, everyone, get to it! Another lunch hour, another antique market. Are you sure your mom's ring isn't with your dad's things? I think it may have been misplaced with the stuff for the estate sale. Oh, here. What can I do for you ladies today? I wanted to take a look at your watches. And she will browse your rings. Oh, the rings are right up front here, and the watches are just that way right there. Okay. Would you like to see one? Actually, um, have you seen any rings that look like this one? Oh... It was my mom's engagement ring. Oh... She died when I was 17, and she gave it to my dad to keep for me, but after he passed last year, it was lost. I do have one with a similar cut. It's the same band, too. Oh... My mom's didn't have an inscription. "Forever My Christmas Love, 1948." I wonder who this belonged to. I feel the same way. I wonder what the story is behind it. What's this? That is the jeweler's insignia. A lot of hand-made jewelry from that time has it. It's sort of like an artist's signature. So this is traceable? The jeweler is. Okay, I'm between these two. Earth to Kendra? Oh, yeah, um, that one for sure. I think I'm going to get it. I'm sorry, what? You're going to buy yourself an engagement ring? Yes. But not for me, for the story. What story? Who did it belong to? What was so special about Christmas in 1948? How did it end up parting ways with its owner? Okay, so for fun? No, this is it... The human-interest piece that is perfect to take Quizzer to the next level. What if there's no story behind it? If someone found my mom's ring, I'd want them to track me down. Great. It's pretty, but I don't think so. It would be more of an investigative piece, following me as I return the ring to its owner and uncover the love story behind it. I just don't think there's enough to go off of. Ever since I found out my mom's ring was gone, I've felt like... part of me was missing. What if someone out there feels the same way about this ring? I think that's something our readers would be interested in. And the Christmas inscription makes it on theme for our December posts. Sorry. It's a nice idea, but it feels more like wishful thinking. Maybe if I did some digging? I hope one day you find your mom's ring, I really do, but going on a wild goose chase and hoping there's a clickable tale attached just isn't enough for me. I'm sorry, Kendra. Peter, can you come in here for a minute, please? Thank you. Hello? Hey, where are you? I haven't seen you all day. I'm taking a personal day. To do what? I tracked down where the ring was made using the jeweler's insignia. Pine Grove, Massachusetts. I think it's the cutest town I've ever seen. Wait, I thought Linda killed the story. She did. Um... But I am going to have to prove her wrong. What about your elf assignment? Finished it. I did a similar one last year called "what kind of reindeer would you be?" Just sorta modified it. Oh, right. I was inexplicably a Dasher. So what's the plan here? I'm going get the story on the ring, write a great piece, show it to Linda, change her mind, hopefully forever shifting the landscape of our site. That is a lot to process. Well, look, I haven't taken a day off in three years. I have plenty of personal days saved up. Manage your hopes. If it turns out it's just some ring, promise me you'll let this go? Yeah. Of course. Okay. I gotta run. Bye! Oh, um... Uh, excuse me. Hi. Do you know where the Pine Grove jewelry store is? Uh... Well, Pine Grove doesn't have a jewelry store, but the... the Jones General Store down the street... They sell earrings. Isn't this 415 Main Street? Yeah, that's right. 415. It's the bakery. Well, I see that it's the bakery, but it's supposed to be the jewelry store. Oh, is that what it's supposed to be? Yes. Well, I'm sorry our Main Street's not the way it's supposed to be. Uh... You know, I think that there's a complaint box around here somewhere. Don't worry about it. I'm gonna let you get back to, um... measuring the sidewalk, but you have been a great help. You know, actually, I'm finished measuring the sidewalk, so good luck to you finding your jewelry store. - Okay. - Okay. Well, hello! Can I help you with anything? Hi! Yes. I'm trying to find the right address, but only the bakery pops up. Well, what are you looking for? Pine Grove Jewelers? Ah, well, you've got the right address, but you're about 40 years too late. My grandfather used to be a jeweler. This was his shop. But I didn't get that gene, hence the bakery. Care for a sample? Things I can't say no to... Sugar and Christmas. How about a box? 50% off for new customers. Oh, no thank you. I actually tracked down this address because I was researching... where this ring was made. Huh. Grandpa did nice work. and I wanted to find out who the ring was made for. I love their quizzes. Did you know that, personality-wise, I most resemble the reindeer Prancer? I could see that. So the ring? Unfortunately, I did not take my wife's advice and digitize Grandpa's records. Oh. But I do have his old ledger here. I could check that? That would be great. 1948. Okay. All right... 1948... Oh, here we go. Diamond engagement ring. Ordered by... William Jones. Do you know him? Yeah, he and his wife, Pearl, used to own the general store. Unfortunately, they're both deceased. Oh. Is that the store down the road? Yeah, but it's after00, so they're probably closed. Oh. You know, Pearl's house is just a couple of blocks from here, and her grandson, Michael, lives there now. Maybe... Maybe he might know something about the ring. Great. Thank you so much. Oh, yeah, sure. And, you know, if you're staying long, my wife, Cathy, owns the bed and breakfast in town, so. Wonderful. Paul. Yeah. Paul. Delicious. Hello? Excuse me. Excuse me! Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you. I tried the front door, but then I heard the noise, and... Well, I hate to disappoint, but, you know, this isn't a jewelry store either. I'm looking for you. Well, look, I don't mean to be rude, but whatever you're selling, I probably don't need. Oh, I'm not a solicitor. Actually, um, I wanted to ask you... about this ring. I think it belonged to your grandmother. My grandma never wore a ring like that. Are you sure? Well, she raised me, so, yeah, pretty sure. - Oh. - What is this for? I was thinking I could... Wow, you guys are getting creative, aren't you? A ring? That's how you thought you'd get an interview? Look, like I've told all of the reporters before you, I don't want to talk about it. I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding. I'd appreciate it if you'd leave. He just shooed you away? It was really strange. He said he didn't recognize the ring and he thought I was there to interview him about something else. What's his name? Michael Jones. I know that name. Why is that familiar? Probably because it's as common as John Smith. Is this him? Yes, that's him! Wow, you're good. That's Sandra Evans' ex! You know that article Peter did on that development heiress? Vaguely. I mean, I only skimmed it. Michael was her business partner and her fianc√©. Michael Jones and Sandra Evans were the founders of Upward Design, an architecture firm that specialized in small-space living. Oh, right. Although this was Evans' first venture outside of her family's development empire and Jones was an unknown architect, Forbes magazine soon deemed them the next company to watch. Eight months ago, Jones abruptly left the company and all his shares after the two ended their engagement. Huh. Seems like tons of sources have statements from Sandra, but nothing from Michael. This interaction is making so much more sense now. What are you going to do? I just need more time to show him that I only want to know about his grandma's ring, that's it. Good luck. He seems like a very private person. Can I get you anything else? Actually, yeah. Can I get the address to your wife's inn? No problem. Glad to hear you'll be staying in town. Good evening. Hi. I was hoping you had room here for tonight? Your husband pointed me here. We sure do! Hi, I'm Cathy. I'm Kendra. Nice to meet you. Are you in town for the Main Street Christmas Festival? Tree lighting is tomorrow! No, actually, I'm here researching the origins of an engagement ring. Turns out Paul's grandfather made it. I found it at an antique sale in Boston and I was hoping to write an article on its backstory for the website I work for. Beautiful. Paul was able to find out that it was made for Pearl Jones. I loved Pearl, such a sweetheart. You knew her? I took over as chairwoman of the Christmas Festival from her. Would you mind if I asked you some questions about her? Not at all. Here, let me show you to your room so you can get settled in, and I'll make us some cocoa. That sounds lovely. Thank you. My dad actually proposed with his grandmother's ring in front of the Eiffel tower. Family heirloom. Knowing it's lost feels like... I've lost my parents all over again. That's why it's become a habit, really, to check any antique store I come across. But this time, I found someone else's ring, and I couldn't help but think, just maybe someone out there might be missing it. I wish it looked more familiar. How well did you know Pearl? I didn't really know Pearl well until I started helping out with the Christmas Festival. You mentioned that before and I saw the banner downtown. What is that? Every year for the past 80 years, the town hosts events along the main street. It leads up to a big Christmas Eve dance. Tomorrow kicks it off with the tree lighting in the town square. That sounds so fun. Growing up, my parents went all out every year. I miss those days. Then you have to come. Oh. Speaking of the Christmas Eve dance, I just thought of something that might be of interest to you. The Christmas Eve Decorating Committee from a few years ago. Pearl's last one with us. She looks really happy. She loved the dance so much. Apparently, that's where her and her husband first met. Really? Do you know what year? You should ask her grandson. He be able to tell you more about it. I tried. Michael made it very clear he did not want to talk to me. Try her other grandson, Scott. He took over running the family's general store. He'll be my first stop in the morning. There we go. Whoa! I didn't know anyone was... It's you again. Yes, it's me. Sorry, I didn't see you there. What are you doing here? I thought I'd made myself clear. Well, actually, I am not here for you. Okay, good, because I'm on my way out and I wouldn't want to talk to you anyway. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Good morning! Hi. Hi. I was just making a cup of coffee. Would you like one? Oh, yes, please. Thank you. Can I help you find anything? Um, in a way. I'm from out of town. My name's Kendra. Well, it's good to meet you, Kendra. Welcome to Pine Grove. I'm Scott. This is my wife, Trish. - Hi. - Hi. Look, my brother's business, is just that, his business. We have nothing to say about it. Oh, no, no. I'm not here about Michael. Actually, I found this ring in Boston, and I think it belonged to your grandmother, and I was wondering if you had some more information on it. What makes you think this was my grandmother's? I tracked the jeweler's insignia to Pine Grove. It was made for William, your grandfather. Hmm. I don't recognize it. So you never saw her wear it? Not even on special occasions? No. I don't think so. Are you sure it was Pearl's? No. That's what I'm trying to confirm. The description in the jeweler's ledger was the same, but, so far, no one seems to remember Pearl having this ring. Hmm. You asked Michael? I did. Um... right before he asked me to leave his property. Yeah. He's had a pretty rough year. There must be something we can do to look into the ring. I was hoping to maybe look through some family albums? Those are all with Michael at the moment, and I really don't think he'd be up for that. I want you both to know I didn't realize who Michael was until I got here. I'm the editor in chief at the Pine Grove Gazette. We have a whole back room of old newspapers and microfilm, and the benefit of being in a small town is that everything makes the newspaper. Maybe you'd like to come look and see if there's something helpful there? Yes, that would be great! Great. I'm going right now if you're free? I am! Thank you so much. Of course. Oh, thanks again for the coffee. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. Bye, honey. I love that Pine Grove still has a printed newspaper. Me too. It was one of the reasons I moved here after college. So you're not from here? No. Became editor about 10 years ago, I met Scott, and now it's home. - Did you know Pearl? - I did. I was lucky enough to know her for a few years, actually. She gave the best hugs. Do you know if there was ever a break-in or a robbery at Pearl's residence? Not that I know of. You really are just here just to investigate the ring. Ever since I found it, I've had this overwhelming need to uncover the story behind it. I've been like that my whole life. Always curious to figure things out. My dad used to call me "Nellie" as a nickname. As in Nellie Bly? "Energy rightly applied and directed will accomplish anything." Wow. She's the reason I went into journalism. Me too! Let me show you something. This is our microfilm reader. Now, the Gazette's been in print since 1902 and everything is organized by year. The ring inscription says 1948, so I'll start around there. This is more than I could ask for. I'll just be down the hall if you need some help. Thank you again, so much. Of course. I'm just so excited to see what you find. I'll let you know. "War veteran and railroad worker William Jones proposed to Pearl Ellen on December 24, 1948 at the Pine Grove Christmas Eve Dance, exactly one year after they met." Oh, great, the tree lighting! Oh! I mean, now it just feels like you're following me around. I promise you, I'm not. I was just doing some research. Right, on that ring that you claim belonged to my grandmother. Um... not a claim anymore. I've never seen this picture before. They made a cute couple. And see? The ring. Where did you say you found the ring again? Antique sale in Boston. How'd it wind up in Boston? That's what I want to know. They seem like they were very much in love. You know, after he died, she'd go on and on about how great a man he was. I mean, maybe it was stolen? Maybe. I sometimes wonder if that's what happened to my mom's. I was searching for her ring when I found this one. Kendra! You left your laptop. Oh, you're a life saver. Thank you so much. - Michael, hey. - Hey. Did Kendra show you what she found? Uh, yeah, she did. So, how's the set-up coming? It's getting there. The newspaper sponsors the Main Street Festival, so I wrangled this builder extraordinaire to set up the booths. Oh! I am happy to put my skills to use. The best architects are the ones who know how to build with their own two hands. Do you have a firm here in Pine Grove? Uh, no. No, I don't. Well, it's something to consider. You know what, I haven't really decided what my future business plans are, but in the time being, I should probably get back to these booths. From everything I've read and heard, the Pine Grove Christmas Festival seems like the place to be. So you'll come? Um, sugary treats, Christmas-tree lightings, a chance to ask around about Pearl? Oh, I'll be there. Great! Actually, if you need a hand with anything, I'd love to help out. It's just been me the past couple of years, so it's been a while since I've had a proper Christmas. We would love that! I'll go get the sign-up sheet. - Okay. - Okay. I've gotten up to talk to you twice now before remembering you're not here today. I miss you, too. Find anything out? I found out where they got engaged, when they got engaged. I know that no one remembers Pearl having the ring, but... she is pictured right here wearing it. And Michael Jones? Any luck with him? I think he's slowly coming around. Michael Jones? Development heiress Sandra Evans' ex, Michael Jones? Hi, Linda. Well, I hope you're enjoying your personal days because we need you back here pronto for a list of the most popular names given to babies born in December. Right. I'll be back tomorrow. I was just doing one last thing before I... Where are you? Is that a painting of a fish? Um, actually, I'm in Pine Grove. Doing what? I traced that ring, and it turns out it was made right here. You are one stubborn writer, you know that? Spending your days off researching a story I said no to. So, have you solved the great ring mystery? Not yet, but getting traction. And how does Michael Jones play into all of this? Funny coincidence, the ring belonged to his grandmother. Have you interviewed him? Not officially, no. You know what? I should have trusted your instincts with this ring from the start. Really? Yeah, I think there's a story there. So... I can keep looking into things here? Get as much information as you can. Stay a few days. Quizzer will pick up the tab. I appreciate that. Just find out everything about the family. And the ring. Of course. Broken engagements, lost rings, perhaps a parallel holiday-heartbreak storyline? Well, I'm not sure if that's the exact angle, but I'll find out the whole story. But whatever you find, make it fit, and remember, I need it by midnight Thursday. At least now Linda's on board. Well, she seemed to perk up when I mentioned the ring's connection to Michael. If that's what it takes to get her to back you, then just maybe mention him in a sentence or two? Or... I'll just have to show Linda more what I had in mind. See ya. Hmm. Merry Christmas. Oh, everything looks so good. Please, take one on us. Which one? Mini trifle cup. Hands-down. Coming right up. Michael, the booth looks amazing this year. Good. I'm glad I could help. Actually, while you still have your toolbox on you, do you mind hanging the extra garland around the stage platform? It just looks a little bland. Say no more. Paul, do you want to give me a hand? Sorry, I have to get more snowman eclairs. I can help you. Uh, yeah, okay. Sure. One for the road? Oh. Oh! So, when you were measuring the sidewalks, it was to help you set up for all this? Yeah. Well, it looks great. I can't tell if you're mocking me. No, I'm serious. It's beautiful. My grandma served on the town's Christmas committee, every single year... The group that puts together the Main Street Festival. You should have seen the store back in those days. I mean, people would come in from all over. She always volunteered me and Scott, so... helping out, it just... It's... just a way for me to feel connected to her. How come there's really not that much decoration at the store now? That's Scott's jurisdiction. I mean, we both inherited the store, it's just... after I moved to New York, it became his thing. I don't know. I haven't really been home for a few Christmases, so I wouldn't feel right telling him what to do with the place. And it seems like Pearl's Christmas shoes would be hard to fill. If this town had crowned a Christmas queen, it would have been grandma. What was her favorite part? Oh, hands-down, the Christmas Eve Dance. Where she met your grandfather. That's right. Yeah. Pass me the... - Thank you. - You're welcome. You seem more at ease when you're working. Well, you know, manual labor was always my forte. I just never really got around to doing much of it in New York. It's rare that you see architects actually doing the building. Normally, we're expected to pose in hard hats on magazine covers. I have a hard time seeing you modeling. I'm gonna take that as a compliment. So... So. What were Pearl and William like together? You don't give up, do you? No. I was about 10 when my grandfather died, so I don't really have too many memories of the two of them together, but from all the stories I've heard and the pictures I've seen, they seem like two people who were very much in love. But it's hard growing up with that as a measuring stick. I mean, my parents were... the perfect example of soulmates. - They made it look easy? - Yes. They set some pretty high standards that, um... I still seem to be chasing. If only we knew their secrets. I'd say the garland looks pretty good. I'm gonna focus on the speakers and the microphones, see if I can get them ready before the countdown starts. Okay. And, um, that roasted-chestnut booth has been calling my name all night. All right. Well, listen, thank you for your help. Thanks for actually letting me ask you a question without telling me to get lost. - All right. - See ya. Bye. Mic hooked up for the countdown? Just about. You and Kendra seem to be getting along. Thank you so much. Yeah. She... she gave me a hand. She seems nice. She is. It's... What? Part of me can't help but think it's one big ruse to get the scoop on my break-up with Sandra. She did find Pearl's ring, and she drove all the way here to look into it. I don't know, that seems genuine to me. Look, I know you don't like to talk about what happened in New York, but I hope you know we're here for you if you want to. All you need to know is that I fell for the wrong person... and I'm not eager to do that again. We want you to know that we think it's possible to trust again. Maybe try showing her some of grandma's things? Let her prove she's here for the right reasons. Merry Christmas. So, ever since we've parted ways, you've just been going around, asking strangers about my grandparents? Pretty much. Mrs. Katz was just telling me that Pearl was the three-time winner of the Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest. Actually, she won four times. Impressive. She was an impressive woman. That's what I'm gathering. Hello, everyone! They're starting. Come on. Welcome to the Pine Grove Gazette's annual Christmas-Tree-lighting ceremony. Now, a very special thanks goes to the Christmas Festival Committee and everyone here who helped set this up. And now for the very best part, I want to hear you all count along loudly with me. Ready? 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3, 2... 1! This place is so special. Look, if you want to come by tomorrow, I could show you some of my grandparents' things. I mean, it might be useful, you know. For the story. That would be wonderful. Thank you. - Sure. - Okay. Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Great. I hope I'm not too early. No, you're good. I... was just trying to finish updating the back porch before another snow storm. What's under that blanket? That is actually my grandfather's old car. It stopped running before I was born, but my grandmother kept it. I've been tinkering with it here and there, trying to get it going again. Wow! A '51 Chevy Deluxe? Yeah. You know your cars. It's that whole mid-century Christmas era. I've always been obsessed with anything related to it. I think it started because all my best Christmas memories were inspired by that time period. Listening to Nat King Cole while decorating our tree with those old-school "Shiny Brite" bulb ornaments. I love Nat King Cole. And my dad inherited my grandfather's collection of these comic books called the Christmas Almanacs. I loved flipping through them, not for the stories, but for the ads inside depicting the picture-perfect Christmas. I get it. It's like... It's like a feeling of nostalgia for a time we've never been to. Exactly. Yeah. Maybe that's why I was so drawn to Pearl's ring. In that case, shall we go inside? Because there is a bunch of stuff in the attic that I think you are going to be very interested in. Okay. Thank you. It's mostly the same as when my grandmother lived here. You know, minus the Christmas decorations, obviously that's all me. I just... I haven't had the heart to take anything down yet, plus... you know, I don't know how long I'm staying. Did you grow up here? Yeah. Our parents died in an accident when we were very little, so we came to live here. After Grandpa died, it was just Pearl and the two of us, so. That's a lot to take on. She didn't think twice about it. I love the old-school Greek-revival architecture. Talk about being transported back in time. Well, actually, it's called Colonial. Because it was built in the 1890s. I guess growing up in a house like this really fueled your passion for design. That's funny, you know, I never thought of it that way, but, yeah, you're right. Plus, Grandpa was super handy. In fact, he built that whole Christmas village up on the fireplace. Oh, the detail is amazing. It's like he shrunk a whole town. Wow. Look at the school. Wow, I don't think I've ever seen an attic so beautifully lit. Pearl made sure there was a touch of Christmas all year round. You know, Scott and I haven't really had a chance to go through all these. We've been so busy trying to get the store ready to sell. Feel free to take a look around. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh... What's this? That is our old dress-up chest. Oh... It seems so much smaller. - I'll show you. - Okay. - May I? - Yeah. Grandma used to make all our costumes. Wow. Okay. This is from our school Christmas play. You played a reindeer? Comet to be exact. I would have pegged you more as a Blitzen. Okay, that's really weird because I actually took a quiz online one time that said I was more of a Blitzen. What? I wrote that quiz. Really? Mm-hmm. Because that feels very different to me from investigating the origins of a ring. Well, lists and quizzes are Quizzer's bread and butter. My hope with doing this article is to expand its horizons, focus on more substantive pieces. - I like that. - It's risky, though. If this fails, I'll be back to writing "which tree topper are you" full time. How did you end up at Quizzer to begin with? Well, it turns out journalism jobs are hard to come by. Quizzer was one of the only places hiring when I got out of school. Have you thought about leaving? I've gotten comfortable there. The pay is great, and, oddly enough, I'm good at writing quizzes about elves and reindeers. Even after I graduated from Cornell's architecture program, I ended up spending six years working as an assistant at a design firm. They kept promising this promotion. It never came. So, one day, I just woke up, and that was it, I'd had enough. I walked away. Wow. I started my own company. That sounds freeing. What I'm trying to say is that, I mean, you could do that. Right? You could start your own online magazine, you could focus on the stories that you want to write. Talk about taking a risk. Pursuing anything you love usually comes with... comes with risks. Um... How cute is this? That is an elf that I made. In art class. Well, I'm so glad you went into designing buildings and not ceramic elves. Okay, you know what, how about you and I, we grab a couple boxes, and we go through them downstairs? I'll make some hot chocolate. Are you sure this is so I don't find any more elf statues? No. I just think that maybe a sugar boost is in order. Can't say no to that. Grandma's debutante gloves. Oh... and her invitation to the debutante ball. - So elegant. - Right? What's this? My grandfather's pay stubs from the railway. So she was a debutante and he worked at the railroad? Yeah. Huh. Though they were from two different worlds, they still found each other. You make it sound very romantic. It is very romantic. Can I see them? - Strange. - What is it? Well, these pay stubs are in chronological order, but then there's this huge gap in the dates. Maybe some of them are missing. What is this? Blueprints. Of the general store. Wow. Unbelievable. What's this? "My dream for us. W." Well, that's interesting. I didn't know that he designed the general store. I always just assumed that it was something they bought together after they got married. Is there anything else with it? - Maybe in that box? - Um... A deed for the property, dated the same year they got engaged. - 1948. - Uh-huh. The store didn't open until 1951. A structure the size of the general store... That shouldn't have taken them three years to build. Did Pearl ever mention anything about her parents not liking William? No. I mean, not that she ever told me. Why? I'm just wondering if her parents weren't happy with her dating William. Being a debutante, she was supposed to date men of a certain class, you know? And William's job at the railroad would have been considered working-class. Where are you going with this? Oh, I just think it's an interesting facet to the story. So you're thinking William only wanted to be with my grandmother because of her family's money? Oh, no, not at all, I didn't say that. To me, it looks like my grandpa was trying to make something of himself. Right? He wasn't a gold digger. I agree completely. All I'm saying is that it's possible her parents didn't like him based on his status in life, that's all. Yeah, I'm sorry, I just... I don't know why I overreacted. No. It's okay. You don't need to explain yourself. You know what I think? I think our marshmallows need replenishing. - Good morning. - Morning. Do you need a hand? Oh! Putting up more lights? Oh, these aren't for here. They're for the bakery. For Magnify Main Street night. Magnify Main Street? As part of the Main Street Christmas Festival, all the businesses along Main Street go all out with Christmas decor. You think the street's decorated now? You should come back Monday night. People get pretty into it. Hmm. Merry Christmas! You're in jolly spirits. I was helping Paul get ready for Magnify Main Street, and he was telling me how all the stores on the street get decked out to the nines. Yeah, people get into it. Michael mentioned that you two used to help decorate the store with Pearl. We did. Yeah, unfortunately, I haven't had a chance this year. Trish is busy at the paper and it's a tough job for one person. Hmm. Also, as of yesterday, we just got our first offer on the place, so... Must be hard to sell something that's been in the family for so long. Yeah. It just hasn't been doing as well since we lost Grandma. I thought I had what it took to run this place, but... Hey. Come on, it's not your fault. Everybody's just buying everything online these days. I would have loved to have seen this place all decked out back in its heyday. Grandma was always trying to outdo herself year after year. Do you remember the time that she rented that kid train to give rides around the store? Yeah, or the time she set up an ice rink right out front? Well, if it's a matter of needing an extra pair of hands, I can help you. We'll spruce up the store Pearl-style! We? Oh, I'd love to be part of the Pine Grove magic and experience it all first-hand. I'm sure there are some great decorations around here. Yeah. Sounds good to me. I don't know. I mean, Grandma set the bar pretty high. It seems daunting. So then in every decision, we just have to ask ourselves what would Pearl do? There you go. Come on. It's in your DNA. You know, you are the most effectual person I have ever met. Is that a yes? Yes! Yes... All right. You know, for someone who just got an offer on the store, Scott didn't seem that happy. I think Scott blames himself for the store not doing well. He'd rather sell the place than feel like he failed Grandma. He shouldn't feel like that. Times change, and a store like this is difficult to sustain itself this day in age. I know. And I wasn't much help either. I left town first chance I had. I left Scott to figure it all out on his own. Everyone has their own path. What is that? Wow. We are going to rock Monday night! Oh, come on! My grandfather and I built this when I was 7 years old. I had drawn a picture of Santa's sleigh, and he said, "Hey, do you want to make it come to life?" - It's beautiful. - Right? Figure it could use a coat of paint. We could put it out front. Think it will look really nice. What do you say? Want to give me a hand? Of course. All right. Oh. - Michael. - Yeah? What's this? Initials. Your grandparents. I've never seen this before. Huh. 1949? I've got to get this. You know, the last thing I want to do is criticize your painting ability, but you're dripping a lot. Okay, so the initials in the cement said 1949. Uh-huh. That means they started laying the foundation the year after they bought the land for the store. I guess, yeah. I wonder what that means in terms of our timeline? Just that they waited a year before they started construction for some reason or another. Hey, listen, I don't mean to be a downer here, but is there a chance that you're just reading a tad far into everything? I'm just gathering all the information. It's just I don't want you to be disappointed if there's no big mystery here. You don't feel it? Feel what? That there's more to all this. I can feel it. Two people this in love, they wouldn't just misplace an item so special. There's a reason for all of it. I think love can look very different from the outside. There's no real way to know what happened. I just... I don't want to infer too much. The way people inferred about you and your ex? You know, my ex came from a property-development dynasty. So everybody just assumed I was with her to get ahead. But the simple truth is that I fell in love with the girl that I met in my design class. I had these ideas for these small-space living hubs in the city, and she had all of this business experience. So we joined forces, and her parents invested, and we created Upward Design. We built something that was... really special. So what happened? Well, despite accepting my proposal, I guess she didn't really feel the same way I did. She met somebody new. Oh... She said she had to follow her heart, but wanted to remain business partners because, you know, we had such a great thing going, but I just... I couldn't, I couldn't bring myself to do that, so... I walked away. That sounds awful. I'm so sorry. Yeah. Listen... Taking this deep dive into my grandparents' love, I think part of me is just scared that you're gonna uncover something that's gonna make me doubt the strength of their relationship. Whatever I uncover or learn, it doesn't change the fact that they clearly loved each other. And you. Paul. Hi, Kendra. I found something you might find very interesting. I'll be right there. Paul has some information on the ring. Do you want to come with me? You think there's a reason for all this? Let's go see if you're right. Let's. I was looking through my grandfather's old records, hoping to find something to help you with your search, when I found this note written by William to my grandfather, Carl. Wow. "Carl, I was thinking more about the engagement ring we discussed. This is what I was envisioning." "Pearl's parents are talking about sending her to live with her aunt in St. Louis after the New Year. Do you think the ring could be ready by Christmas Eve? It seems building my store will have to wait a little longer. Can't lose my girl! W." See! Pearl's parents didn't approve of her dating William. They were going to send her away, so he had to propose sooner than he thought. And the money he was going to spend building the store... He spent on the ring. That's why he had to wait to break ground. He put his dreams on hold so he wouldn't lose your grandma. He was a smart guy. Oh, I am loving these retro ornaments. They're absolutely stunning. Speaking of retro, I can't believe Grandma kept this. Of course she did. They're beauti... Wait, what is that? This is an ornament that I made in... first grade. Right, but what was it supposed to look like? You can't tell? Mm-mm. It's a... - It's a snowflake? - Oh. - It's abstract. - Like the elf. It's so sweet that she kept it. Clearly, Grandma was sentimental. So then why wouldn't she keep her engagement ring? The one William spent his life savings on? Popsicle ornament for your thoughts? Okay... After William bought the land for the store, he spent the rest of his money on the ring, that's why he had to go back to work on the railroad. Sure. But the initials in the cement say 1949, so how did he get enough money to start building the store only a year later? Based on those pay stubs, he wasn't making that much. You really are way too talented to just be writing lists and quizzes. It's always nice when someone has faith in you. Not too shabby. I think Pearl would be proud. I wish my parents were here for this. My mom would have loved Pine Grove. You know, even though you were looking for your mom's ring, I'm really happy that you found my Grandma's. Me too. Oh, it's my boss. Probably wanting an update. Yeah. Linda. Hi. Just checking in. I haven't seen any drafts from you yet. I'm still piecing it all together. It turns out William bought the ring for Pearl so he wouldn't lose her, even though it meant putting his dreams on hold. Okay, and Michael? Have you had a chance to interview him? Oh... I've been focusing more on the grandparents and the ring first. I trust you'll cover everything. Will you send me what you have so far? Well, it's pretty rough, you know, lots of shorthand notes, and... Kendra I need the final article in three days. I need to see your progress. Now, don't let me down. Okay. I will send you what I have. Thank you. Gotta go, talk soon. A human-interest piece is supposed to be an emotional, relatable story, not spilling the gossip on someone's break-up. I know that, and you know that. You just need to show Linda that through your writing. I really feel like if she would just let me finish the path I'm on, it could be a really meaningful article. Do you think you'll have everything you need by Thursday? Honestly, I don't know. What happened to the ring is still a mystery. If anyone can figure it out, it's you. Thanks. Michael's been a huge help, too. I don't know what I'd do without him. He seems like a great guy. You know, I wasn't sure at first, but he's since surprised me. He even suggested that I should start my own online magazine. Did he now? Oh, no, no, no, it's not like that. The sparkle in your eye when you talk about him is blinding. Is the connection bad? Because you're a little blurry. I should go. I'm not letting you get away with it that easily. You totally have a crush. I should get back to writing, okay? Okay, bye! Hey! Paul had some extra lights and I thought we could put them on the sleigh for tonight. Is everything okay? Yeah. The guy who put in the offer on the store just came by. I was all excited to show him these original blueprints, but... he said they're just gonna tear down the store... put in a Coffee Max. That's a big change. I mean, don't get me wrong, the place is in need of a change, but... you know, I think there's better ways to maximize the space. You see this wall? Mm-hmm... He could knock this down, just open this whole space outward. And see this on the blueprints? Originally, my grandpa wanted to put in a loft, with books and chairs, some place for people to sit and read. Apparently, he didn't have the room for it, but one thing I did at Upward Design was make the most out of small areas. We could move these beams, make the ceiling higher put in that loft-slash-library-cafe. If we rewire through here, we could actually make it a computer lounge. And look at this! See this? This over here... This used to be a soda-fountain counter. They tore it down for more shelving, but Scott doesn't need the retail space. We could rebuild using these plans. Make it a WiFi hotspot. Sounds like you're having second thoughts. My grandfather wanted this to be more than just a store. He wanted it to be a place where people came together. Have you talked to Scott about this? I don't know if he'd be interested. You're his brother. I'm sure he'd want to hear what you have to say. You got it working! Thought I'd transport us to a different time. Oh! Wait! Oh, hold on. It's perfect. The past meets the present. Pearl and William would be so proud. I think they'd love what we did to the store. I hope so. They both had such a great sense of style. Do you just carry that around with you everywhere now? It's part of my job. Your job. That's right. You know, I keep forgetting this is a work assignment for you. I mean, yeah, it's work, but... I care about this story. After all, I'm putting my job on the line for it. Hi. Hot chocolate? - Yes, please. - Thank you. Thank you so much. The store looks better than ever. I'm so glad we did this. I'm so glad Kendra made us do it. - Cheers. - Cheers. Oh, Trish, that reminds me, I wanted to ask you something. Is there a way to get a list of banks and lenders that have been in Pine Grove over the years? Specifically ones around 1949? I can ask at the newspaper. I'm sure those records exist. Why? William broke ground on the property the same year he went back to work for the railroad because he spent all his money on the ring, so where did the money come from to start building the store? So you think he took out a loan? But the only people who could have afforded that would have been Pearl's parents, and they weren't on board with the marriage, so I figured he'd had to have looked elsewhere. Right. Well, I'll ask first thing tomorrow. That would be great. Okay, now I am going to get us some of Paul's Christmas cookies before they sell out. My treat. You'd better make it quick. What? Nothing. I just haven't seen you smile this much in a very long time. - It's Christmas. - Right. Wasn't it a few weeks ago you were saying you couldn't wait to get through the holidays? You know what... I am learning to appreciate everything they have to offer. Well, I think you should learn to appreciate asking Kendra to the Christmas Eve dance. I think that's a terrible idea. Why not? You like her. Yeah. Liking her isn't the issue. He admits it! Then what is the issue? Okay, look, not everybody can be as lucky as you two, okay? Or Grandma and Grandpa. Actually... yes, they we can. How will you know unless you try? Thank you for the ride. Thank you for the fun night. It's sure going to be a change of pace going back to Boston after being in a town like Pine Grove. Well, you know, maybe if the article is a hit, you could find more human-interest stories here. I think we have the highest number of maple trees outside of Vermont. Oh, yeah, my boss is gonna love the click potentials with that headline. You never know, she's letting you write about a ring, right? Um, actually... It's funny you should mention that because there's something I wanted to... Look. What? It's a shooting star. Oh... I missed it. We should make a wish. Okay. I should go. Yeah. Because, technically, I'm still on the clock. Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. So there was only one bank in town at the time, but they didn't have a loan record in William's name. Oh... But I did find an old directory that listed a company on the edge of town called Barney's Loans and Bonds. Anything there? Well, they closed in the '60s, and because they were a private-lending company, there's no public records. Hmm. I wonder if their private records even still exist? Well, they were bought out by Star Credit Union, so there's a possibility they might have some information. Thank you so much for all of this. I'm happy to help. I feel like we're getting closer. Me too. Boys. What is this? Well, Michael and I started looking through the storage to find you some more of those retro Christmas ornaments you like, and we actually found some really great photos of the store over the years. Yeah, you know, besides the soda fountain, this place really hasn't changed that much since it opened. The prices sure have changed. Well, everything could use a good makeover once in a while. - Trying to do that with Quizzer. - Yeah, I know. It's just Grandma made it work for so many years as it is, I honestly don't even know where to start when it comes to updating. Michael had some great ideas for repurposing the space. You should tell Scott. - Oh, yeah? - Uh, yeah. Just, you know, some ideas inspired by Grandpa's original blueprints. But, listen, you know the store better than anybody else, so if you think it makes sense to sell, then that's what we're going to do. Maybe your ideas make sense. I'd love to see them. Look at this. You guys hosted cookie exchanges? Not that I knew of. Is there a date on this? No. I didn't realize the store ever hosted events. You know what, it must have been part of Grandpa's original vision for the store as a community hotspot. We should do this! One last cookie exchange. I love that! A way to say goodbye to the store in the perfect William and Pearl Christmas fashion. And there are no festival activities planned for tomorrow. It's kismet. Okay, I'll post it on the newspaper's site... And the social-media accounts will really get the word out there fast. Okay, I guess we're doing this. Did Pearl have a favorite cookie recipe that you knew of? Oh, yeah. What? Peppermint whoopie pies! Michael, do you still have the recipe? Yeah, I think it's in the kitchen somewhere. I'll find it. I love whoopie pies. I can give you a hand? Because peppermint can be tricky. Yeah, okay. I guess we're doing this. Now, fair warning, even though I've eaten my fair share, I've never actually made whoopie pies from scratch. Well, full confession, neither have I, but, I mean, you know, I know my grandma's recipe has gotta be around here somewhere. I mean, you know, how hard can it be? Okay, recipes... Ah-hah! It's gotta be in here. Here we go. This is it... "Pearl's Peppermint Whoopie Pie." Looks like it's on its last leg. What's this? "My dear Pearl, we may have had our differences, but this needs to stay in the family. Enjoy making these for your new husband. Blessings, your mother." So I guess my great-grandmother gave that to her. Even though she didn't want William to marry Pearl, it looks like this recipe was her way of giving her blessing. I guess things worked out in the end, huh? Yeah. So what do you say, shall we honor Pearl's legacy? Let's get to it. Two cups of flour... Two eggs... I can crack an egg. I can make eggs, I can make eggs. Here we go... Here we go! Yay! That looks so good! This is so great. This is so good. Yes, okay. Are you okay? Oh, yeah, it's just a work thing. Mm! So do we have to cook those, or can we just eat the batter? How much longer? Just a few minutes. I can smell them from here. Mm! So good. Smells like my childhood. How has no one bottled the smell of baked goods? Ooh! I like that. You know what, I think that's going to be my next venture. "What's that cologne you're wearing, sir?" "Baked Goods by Michael Jones." Is that your boss again? No. It's an email Trish got from Star Credit Union. Because she was family, she was allowed to request the records. Uh-huh? - Huh! - What is it? In 1949, William took out a loan. Yeah, a five-year term loan. What does that mean? It just means he was able to get as much as he did because he promised to pay it back in five years. And it looks like he put the land up as collateral. Okay, so the question is, did he pay back the loan in five years, or... Did they have to find the money some other way? Like selling the ring? Whoopie pies are ready. Thank you. Enjoy. I'm so glad we did this. Seeing people in the store again is just... it's great. This is what it's supposed to be like. Michael and Scott look like they're enjoying themselves, too. You know, I think they're having second thoughts. About selling? I just know the real-estate agent sent over some papers to sign, and they've been sitting on our kitchen counter untouched for days. Oh. Well, they do seem at home here. And with each other. When Michael moved away and started dating Sandra, he and Scott drifted apart. It's so nice to see them coming together again. He's a good guy. Michael? Yeah, he's great. - What? - I didn't say anything. Did you guys see what the Kleins brought over. Look at this. - Oh! - Wow. Read the back. "Cookie exchange 1954." Looks just like ours. I don't know if it was the first one, but it was probably close to it. Look. Pearl's not wearing the ring anymore. What about the fact that they came from different backgrounds but overcame that? Or the fact that they met at a Christmas Eve Dance, and then got engaged exactly one year later at the same dance right before Pearl was going to be sent away? That's all great, but I know that Michael and Sandra's break-up is the hook for our readers, and you have enough of his story to focus more on that. I know you think our readers want to hear about bad break-ups, but I think that they'll also want to read a story about family and love and a ring that brought people together. You are a great writer. I know you can figure out how to include both. You get your human-interest piece, I get my clicks. Kendra, I let you follow this story, and I want to publish it. Can't you just be happy about that? Now, work on making Michael the focal point. How his failed engagement is in juxtaposition with his grandparents' love. That's the interesting part. Good luck. Thanks for coming here with me. Why do you think a jewelry dealer in Willow Brook is going to know something? Okay, every picture of Pearl had her wearing the ring until 1954. Now, that was around the same time the loan was due. I asked Paul, did he think that Pearl or William ever sold the ring back to Carl. He said his grandfather never bought jewelry back, but he referred people to a dealer here. It shouldn't be much further. I don't think Scott should sell the store. Seeing the place all decorated again, and seeing what it's like when people gather there, talking about all these amazing things we could do to the place... I kind of feel like... I don't know, I feel like maybe we gave up too soon. Well, I hope me doing this article hasn't thrown a wrench in anything. Are you kidding? You writing this article was a good thing. I mean, I've never felt this close to my grandparents or to Scott. Um, speaking of this article, there's something I need to talk to you about. Okay. Okay... Um... I promise this article is not going to be about you, but I might have to use your name. You've been such a big part of my experience here, and it might be weird if I used a pseudonym for you. But I won't if you're not okay with it. No, it's okay. I get it. I mean, they're my grandparents. It makes sense. Just... you know, maybe don't mention that I'm "that" Michael Jones. Right. I'm just getting to that point where I feel like I've put all that all behind me. Of course. Thank you. I think this might be it. Oh. Should we go take a look? - Yeah. - Okay. Merry Christmas. Can I help you find anything? Hi. Um... This may sound a little bizarre, but I'm wondering if this engagement ring I found may have come through here around 1954. We definitely don't have records going back that far, but my great uncle has worked here forever. Maybe he could help? Is he here? No, he's retired, but he loves when I call him from the store. If you guys have a second? Yeah, sure. That would be great. Cady my dear, you need help pricing an item? No, actually, there's this couple who's got a question about a ring we may have bought a long time ago? Hi. I'm trying to trace the history of this ring, and I wanted to know if it was sold to you in the early 1950s? I know it's a long shot, but this one has a very unique inscription. "Forever My Christmas Love, 1948." You found it! I've been keeping my eyes peeled for that ring for years! A woman came in... Gosh, must have been 65 years ago. Said she had sold it to us to keep her husband's business afloat. Broke my heart when I told her it was already gone. She must have come back for it after the store started doing well. At different times in their lives, they both sacrificed what was most important to them for their love. They knew that being together, following their dreams, meant more than a ring. Oh, looking good, bro. I don't think we should sell. You don't? I've been thinking a lot about your ideas, and you're right, with some changes, this store could be viable again. I mean, Grandma and Grandpa put so much of themselves into this place. They left it behind for us. Selling would kind of feel like losing them all over again. I agree. I think this place could really be something unique. Listen, I'd love to show you some of the modifications I made to the blueprints. - Yeah. Let's do it. - Yeah? We just have to get to the newspaper Christmas party. Right. We'll talk later? I'm looking forward to it, bro. - Me too. - All right. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. - For what? - For everything. None of this would have happened without you. You really reconnected us to our legacy. What are you doing? Well, with my article being due tonight, I want to be able to say I returned the ring to the family in the end. Hey, um... Would you like come to the Christmas Eve dance with me? I mean, with the article finished, I figure... it wouldn't be a conflict of interest anymore. I would love to go with you. - Great. - Great. Now, um... - I'd better go finish writing. - Uh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Bye. Goodbye. Hey. Just calling to see how it's going. It's going. I mean, I have the perfect ending. Are you doing the article you want or the one Linda wants? I'm doing the article on The Christmas Ring, and what true love really takes. - I admire you. - Thanks. I'm hoping the words speak for themselves. Can't wait to read it. Talk soon. Come in. Thought you could use some nourishment. You're too kind. I'm so glad you found out what happened to the ring. And I'm sure Michael and Scott are glad, too. I'm glad I could return it. Maybe someday, somebody will find your mom's ring and they'll return it to you. Maybe, but I realized I wanted the ring back so bad because I wanted my mom back. But the truth is, I don't need a piece of jewelry to have my mom with me. As long as I hold her in my heart and my memories, she's always with me. Maybe the search for it was all I needed. After all, it led me here and it led me to... The story. Well, I'll let you get back to it. I'm so sorry, Kendra. Linda ruined it. Your version was so much better. Call me. No, no, no, no, no. This isn't my article. Oh, no! This is all wrong! Michael. You lied to me. No. Michael, my boss did this. She took my words and she twisted them. You made me believe that you were writing this story about true love... about how love takes sacrifice and risk... and instead, you used me. You have to believe me. This isn't what I wanted. This isn't what I wrote. You should leave. Michael. I need you to leave. Kendra! You completely changed it. I colored it up a bit, but that's my job. I'm your editor. Your article is good, but the heartbreak of a man licking his wounds after losing it all to an ex who falls in love with someone else is way more juicy. I told him it wasn't about him. Well, it was his grandma's ring, he was part of the story the whole time. I'm sure he knew that. No, he didn't. I know you want to write these articles on the human experience and meaningful moments, but I want to sell ad space, and that's where Quizzer is at the moment. Now, I gave you a chance, it just didn't work. You're right. Well, good, I'm glad we're on the same page. You're right that this isn't working. I've been so scared to leave this place and lose out on a good-paying job, but I love to write about what actually matters... and sometimes... real love takes sacrifice. What are you getting at? I quit. Pick up. Please, please, pick up. Kendra, hi. Trish, I'm so glad you answered. I have been thinking about you non-stop. You're not mad at me? Look, call it journalistic intuition, but I don't think you had anything to do with that article. I wish Michael understood that. I know, I tried, I did. He's... he's just too upset right now. None of this would have happened if I hadn't interrupted his life. Perhaps, but you brought Michael and Scott together, and you reconnected them to William and Pearl. I want to make this right, but I need your help. How can I help? Would the Pine Grove Gazette run the real story of The Christmas Ring? The one I wrote? We would be honored. Okay, I need to make some changes, but I will send it to you tonight. Great. I'll make it front page tomorrow, just in time for the dance. Thank you. With a ring that had been passed down in his family for four generations. I know this because when I was little, I used to sit on my mother's lap and turn the ring around and around while she told me that they were blessed with the legacy of love. After my mom passed away, my dad held onto the ring, promising it would be mine one day. Last year, he joined my mom, and I was left with a hole in my heart. A few weeks after his funeral, I realized I hadn't seen the ring in any of my father's things. It was gone, and it felt like I lost them both all over again. So I made sure to check every antique shop I passed, but time and time again, my search turned up short. That was until two weeks ago, when I found someone else's engagement ring at an antique market in Boston. The ring was stunning, and the inscription inside moved me. I had to know the story behind this ring. And so I began my quest, and it led me to Pine Grove, Massachusetts, a town so full of Christmas magic, I felt like a kid again. William Jones worked on the railroad in Pine Grove and was saving up to open up his dream store, but in 1947, at the Main Street Festival's Christmas Eve dance, his plans changed when he met a beautiful debutante named Pearl. Although they were from different worlds, the two quickly fell in love. He decided to put his dream on hold and order a very special custom engagement ring for Pearl. Not one to wait, William soon took out a loan and began building the store, but as most businesses do, it struggled in the first couple of years and William and Pearl were in danger of losing it all. So Pearl did the only thing she could do to help keep her love's dream alive... She sold the ring. The Jones General Store is still in the family, owned by William and Pearl's grandsons, Scott and Michael. Even they didn't know the story behind the ring, but, together, we discovered that it was so much more than a circle of gold, it was a symbol of family, of sacrifice, and, above all... a symbol of true love. While uncovering the story behind the ring, I started to fall in love with Michael. I realized it was time to take a risk, time to quit my job and follow my own path. So here I am now, sharing the true story of the Christmas Ring, a story I didn't realize I had become a part of. That is why I'll be at the Pine Grove Christmas Eve dance, where Pearl and William first met, and I'll be there waiting for Michael, in the hopes that he feels the same way and can see that even though I went to Pine Grove looking for answers about a stranger's ring, what I found was the missing piece to my own heart. Hi. It was a lovely article. Thank you. I hope everyone feels that way. Have faith. I'll try. Any sign of him? I tried calling. There's still time. Whatever happens, I want to thank you both so much, for everything. No, Kendra, thank you. I'm going to go get us some cider? Okay. I'll have another look around. You look beautiful. Michael, I'm so sorry. I should have... No, no. I'm sorry. I should have believed you. Would you like to dance? So is it true you walked away from Quizzer? I did. I decided to take you up on your suggestion of starting my own online magazine, strictly human-interest pieces, like "The Christmas Ring." I think that's a great idea. Have you decided where will your offices be? Right now? Out of my apartment in Boston. That is a funny coincidence. I'm actually moving to Boston soon. You are? You know, redesigning the store completely inspired me. I'm starting a new firm. One that focuses on taking buildings of the past and updating them for the future. It's gonna be a brand-new start. And what better place for both of our goals than Boston? What about Pine Grove? It's not too far. It's where I'll spend my weekends... and you can join me if you want to. After all, you're a part of the story now. Which is why, I think Pearl... would want you to hold on to this. May I? Yes.
