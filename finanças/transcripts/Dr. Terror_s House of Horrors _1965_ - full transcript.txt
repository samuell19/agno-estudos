Pardon me. I think there is room for one more in here, is there not? Yes, right here. Oh, thank you. I'm so sorry to disturb you. - Oh, that's all right. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, I'm so sorry. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hey, that's a funny looking deck, man. How do you play poker with these? They're tarot cards. You are familiar with the tarot? I wouldn't say that. But I've seen the cards before. Doctor Schreck. Doctor of Metaphysics? The science which investigates the first principles of nature and thought. And nonsense. Schreck is a German word, isn't it? Means fright, fear, something like that. A more exact translation would be terror. An unfortunate misnomer for I am the mildest of men. However, I sometimes foretell things that are frightening. With these? They are the key, yes. The key? The key to what? Ancient wisdom. The tarot deck is a picture book of life, an answer to the deepest questions of philosophy and history, and sometimes a means of prediction. Fortune telling'? Of a kind. What kind? There is within each of us a twin destiny: the natural and the supernatural. The cards are attracted to the supernatural part of that destiny as one pole of a magnet attracts an opposite pole. Supernatural part? The strange, the weird, the unknown, the terrifying, the mysterious. At one time or another during our lives we may, any one of us, encounter it. This deck can forewarn us. I call it my House of Horrors. How does it work? The person, whose fortune is to be told, touches the cards three times. Then they are shuffled and dealt. The first four cards predict his destiny. The fifth gives him the knowledge to change it. If change is possible. Really, do we have to suffer all this nonsense? There's no harm in it. Astrologers, spiritualists, table-rappers, the entire lunatic fringe. They have been exposed for the charlatans they are, over and over again. I don't know. I don't know. A gypsy once told me I was going to get an unexpected gift. That very day I walked under a pigeon The tarot deck is a serious matter. The cards predict the truth. The supernatural truth. Always! Anybody, who believes that, will believe anything. Perhaps you would like to learn your future? Just tap the cards. I must warn you, gentlemen. This is undoubtedly a well rehearsed prelude to some shabby confidence trick. You can fool all these others as much as you please, Doctor, but kindly leave me out of it. How about me? Come on. I'm game. You are not afraid? Well, if it's going to happen to me anyway, what's there to be afraid of? Very well. Tap the cards three times. I do not manipulate them. They use my hands to manipulate themselves and to present your destiny. The Chariot. The High Priestess. The Moon. The Enchantress. Fine. Yes. Yes, you do that. I will. Goodbye. Oh, how they talk! You busy? Yes, I'm working on the Morrison project. Well, there's no rush for that. This letter came this morning from that Biddulph woman you sold your house to. She wants to make some major structural alterations and seems to think you're the only architect to deal with it. Doesn't say what the alterations are. Does it matter? A lonely widow, rich, beautiful Well, I'd be glad to spend a few days on that island with her myself. Thank you, sir. Hey. Hey, if it's not Mr. Jamie Caleb! How good to see you. I didn't expect you back, sir. Well, Mrs. Biddulph wrote and asked me to give her advice about altering the house. Is anyone at home, d'you know? My grand-daughter, Valda Ah, Valda, is the mistress in'? Upstairs, Grandfather. Come in. You were about this high the last time I saw you. Oh, Mr. Dawson, how wonderful. I had no idea you would be here so soon. I was free and naturally I was interested in the house. I'm very grateful to you, by the way, for calling in my firm for the job. Oh Valda, will you prepare the guest room for Mr. Dawson, please? Come in here. It doesn't seem to have changed very much. What exactly do you want done? Oh, what I want principally is to have that wall knocked down to make one large room. You know like a ballroom. There shouldn't be any problems, should it? No. No, I don't think so. But it's an old house. I'd want to examine it very carefully before I make up my mind. Well, I thought you'd know it better than anyone else. Yes, I should. My family lived here for centuries before I had to sell it. But still I think I'd better look at the foundations and the walls and everything very carefully before we decide to make any radical changes. Well, I have to go down to the village for an hour or so. If there's anything you want, just ask Caleb or Valda. May I ask you a personal question? If it's not too personal. Why does a beautiful woman like yourself want to bury herself in the Hebrides? My husband was a very wonderful man. It took me a long time to get over his death. In fact, after the funeral I had a sort of breakdown. The doctors decided that I needed complete rest and quiet. So I came here. But now you've decided you want to rejoin the human race, aye? Why do you say that? Well, you're having this room made into a ballroom. That's not for entertaining. You see my husband was an archeologist. He had a large collection of very valuable specimens from all over the world. I intend to turn this into a sort of museum to his memory. It's a beautiful house, and you're welcome to visit us any time. Thank you. What was that? I didn't hear anything. Valda! Valda! Yes, sir. Oh, I'm sorry to bother you, but d'you know where the key to the cellar is? No, sir, I don't. Well, would you be good enough to ask your grandfather if he knows? Yes, sir. The lock's been oiled recently. That's strange. I did't do it. Here is the torch for you. Caleb. Aye. Come down here, will you? Caleb, do you know what this is? Must be the coffin of Cosmo Waldemar. The werewolf! Over two hundred years ago Cosmo Waldemar claimed that this house was really his and that my ancestors had stolen it from him. And he vowed that one day he'd return. He swore that his place would be taken by whoever owned the house and that he himself would once again assume human shape. His grave was never found. But it was here in the walls of this cellar for all this time. Not all this time. This plaster is new. I'm going to find out what's in that coffin. Come on. Give me a hand. We'll need something stronger than this. Come on. Oh, Mrs. Biddulph. Did you see anything come out of the house? No. What's the matter? Nothing. Here let me give you a hand with those. Oh, thank you. The only thing I don't like about living on this island is the fact that the shops won't deliver Oh, put them down there, will you? Oh, I see you've found the key. No, no. Caleb had a spare one. Will you have to work down there? Eh, yes, yes, I think so. Well, how long do you suppose the work will take? Just a short time, Mrs. Biddulph. Has anyone been down in that cellar since you moved in? Well, I suppose the workmen were down there. I haven't. Why? It doesn't matter. Go up to your room and lock your door. Go on. Caleb, what does the legend say? That Cosmo would return and take his revenge on the owner of the house. Do you know that Valda left me a note tonight, saying she had to see me? She knew something about Do you have a gun? Aye. Get it. What are you going to do? Something came out of that coffin tonight. Something evil and strange. I don't know why it killed Valda. But I know who it's going to kill. My great grandfather had this made of the silver sword that killed Cosmo. It's hung in the house ever since to protect it. I'm going to melt it down and make bullets, silver bullets. And when that coffin opens tomorrow night, I'll be waiting. Come in. I don't understand it. The legend says the only way to kill a werewolf is with a bullet made from a silver crucifix. I had six. You mean these? You see, what the legend really says is that Cosmo Waldemar will resume human shape again when he is replaced in his coffin. Not by the owner of the house, but by a descendant of the man, who killed him. Now any dutiful wife would do anything to bring her husband back to life. Even after two hundred years. Are you trying to tell me that's going to happen to me? Where are you going now? Bradley. And then? To the Island of Unga in the Hebrides. Turn the fifth card. Well, what was it? Nothing. Come on, show me that card. Tell me. Don't be so gullible. Can't you see it's all part of the act? What act, Mr. Marsh? Is your name Marsh? Don't be mislead by his knowing that. There's no magic about it. I can assure you. Yeah, but how did he know? Maybe it's on his baggage. There's no mystery about it, gentlemen. Most informed people have heard of Franklyn Marsh, art critic. Confidence tricksters make a point of beign familiar with people in the news. Well, I've never heard of you. Dr. Schreck, I'd like to try those cards if you don't mind. If you think so. And now your prediction. You are going on holiday soon? Alone? - With your wife and your daugther. Daughter... How did you know? Perfectly simple. He saw the doll up on the rack. And a dog. That's right. You'll see them all when we get to Bradley. They're meeting me at the station. And when you return from holiday and when you return. I've got Katie, Mummy. Bill? - Yeah. Bill, come and look at this. It wasn't there before. It must have grown while we were away. Well, you'd better get rid of it, or it'll kill all the hydrangeas. Not even home yet and back to work already. Au! What is it? What is it? Bill? It seemed to cry out in pain when I hit it. And I couldn't cut into it with a hoe. Give me the shears. I could almost swear that vine pushed those shears out of my hands. Have you ever seen anything like this before, Gerry? No, it's new to me. You say this vine seemed actually to resist cutting? Well, I'm pretty good at handling garden tools. I don't think those shears slipped. Can you put me up for a few days'? Hm. Sure. Easier to find out what this is all about on the spot. Better than staring through some wretched microscope here at the Ministry. Too true. Come on, raise up Rusty, come on. Come on, Rusty. Oh Rusty, come on. Rusty, go on, fetch it. Fetch it! I'm sorry, Mr. Drake. - That's all right. Here you are. Come on, Rusty Come on, Rusty. Come on. Come on. Raise up Rusty. Carol! Yes, mummy? Time for tea. I'll get Rusty's in a minute. All right. Rusty, go after it, go after it! A dog strangled by a vine. I can hardly believe it. A plant that protects itself. It's impossible. Hm. That's what I thought at first, but have a look at this. Now these are the main groups of plants of whose existence we already now know. First: plants without roots, stems or leaves, bacteria, and lichens. Fungi After that: mosses. A sligtly higher form with neither roots nor vascular tissue. Third: ferns which have roots and vascular tissue but no flowers. And fourth: a flowering plant. They have roots, stems, leaves, vascular tissue and flowers to help spread their seeds. Finally the Just one second. They're what we call the insectivorous plants. The borderline between the plant and animal kingdoms. Plants which are not dependent entirely on soil and sunlight for their food, but which sometimes eat live insects. Well Each stage, each adaption, each mutation is one step higher in the battle of the plant kingdom for survival. Now what if What if a plant were to take the next step? What if there were a mutation that could developed intelligence? The ability to protect itself? Perhaps even to know who its enemies were and destroy them? A plant like that could take over the world. But it's not possible, it's fantastic! I wonder Lunch will be ready in a few moments. Oh yes. Well, I'm awfully busy at the moment. Do you mind if I skip lunch today? Oh, you've got the eat something. I'll get you some coffee and sandwiches. Oh, thank you. A brain. I was right. Darling, it's a lovely day. Why don't you go out and play? It isn't any fun without Rusty. Did you call the police? We didn't know what to do. We thought it'd be better to call you first. He was alone in the room? - Yes, all the time. I'm going to the lab to get my men down. Carol Carol, come away. How are we going to get out? There must be some way of destroying this. There must be. I know it. Get some newspapers. There's one thing, which every intelligent thing is afraid of: the fire! If a species ever develops that isn't, it could be the end of the world. Open the door. Should be alright now. And that's going to happen to me? Maybe to all of us. But you need not despair. The fifth card may show you how to avoid What is it? It does not matter. What was it? I was hoping it ...it might not be Oh for heaven's sake! What is all this nonsense? No nonsense, I assure you. Now is there anyone else who would wish to try? Okay I'll have a I'll have a try. The first time I've ever done this without chips. Just tap the cards three times. And now your future. You are a musician? Yes. A lot of people don't seem to think so. Ah, that's more like it. That's my mother in law. Do not jest at the image of a God. A God? The powerful and malign God of Voodoo. Hi, Wally. What's the good word? You're going to love me. Oh yeh. Purely, as a mother. I've got a great booking for you. Oh yeah, what have you got us this time? Siberia? No. Days of sunshine and romance. Nights under an azure sky. Another holiday camp, right? The West Indies, Island of Paiti, town of Dupont, Club called "The Flamingo". Good? Yeah, great. When do we go? - Two weeks. Hey, you little sweetheart.

It could be a hit, make a fortune. If you wrote it, we could go 50-50. It belongs to the God Dambala. Known only to his own people for centuries. Oh, well, if it's that old, then it's out of copyright. You get creases in my shirt. The God Dambala is a jealous God. If you steal from him, he will be revenged.

Which way to Piccadilly Circus, mac? Yeh... Yeh... Oh, these British are all nuts. That'll teach me not to steal tunes. Well, how do I get out of it? Ours was the same? What does it mean? I'll tell you what it means. Absolutely nothing. What makes you so sure? Foretelling the future with a pack of cards Complete rubbish. Then why are you afraid to try them? Afraid? To participate in your ridiculous parlour game? Very well. Very well. Shuffle your cards. Foretell my destiny. Remarkable, really remarkable. I don't think there's very much more that can be said about that particular atrocity. Dear, dear, dear Yes, atrocity is right. Ah. What have we here? Yes, indeed a work of notable incompetence, even for Mr. Eric Landor. You don't like my work, Mr. Marsh? Ah, the great man himself. One wonders why you come to my exhibitions so regularly if my work displeases you. Duty, my dear sir, duty. My paper pays me to attend these exhibitions, so attend them I must whether the artist in question is a genius or a charlatan. And you consider yourself competent to judge? I don't think my reputation as a critic has ever been called in doubt. In that case, I wonder why you never give me advice on how to improve my work. My dear sir, the only advice that I could possibly offer you, would be: give up. A harsh thing to say to a man who's been painting all his life with some measure of success. Success! If we are discussing money, pray let's not delay any longer. I was under the impression we were discussing art. Take this masterpiece, for example. Just what is it supposed to say? It is merely a series of splodges of print applied without any creativity whatsoever. What is it supposed to mean? Nothing specific. The viewer is supposed to react to it. To create his own meaning out of his own experience. Everyone will see something quite different. In other words: it means absolutely nothing. To those who can't see. But I can see, Mr. Landor. I can see very well, when there is something worth seeing. I live by my vision, Mr. Landor. Mr. Marsh... We have a canvas in from a young artist we're thinking of exhibiting shortly. I wonder if you'd mind telling us what you think of his work. Well, it's highly irregular. Oh please, please. Oh very well, just this once. Thank you. Ah now, this is quite a different matter, quite a different matter indeed. Clearly the work of a creative artist of considerable promise. Notice the wide sweep of colour, the balance, the brushwork, together with a certain denial of the accepted standards, the mock critical humour of the entire composition. You could learn a great deal about painting from this artist, Mr. Lander. Then I should very much like to meet him. Would that be possible? He's here now as a matter of fact. - Indeed? My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, we have as our guest of honour tonight the eminent author and art critic Mr. Franklyn Marsh. My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am extremely honoured to have been asked to address this fine organisation, which has done so much to foster an interest in the arts. The world of art today The world of art today The day of the action painter is over. Soon art will regain its sanity and return to the fundemental representational principals of You were saying, Mr. Marsh I must crave your indulgence. I have a pressing appointment. He's so fascinating on this subject. Have they found out who the patient is yet, nurse? Yes, Eric Landor, the artist. Artist? Not anymore! The European Space Reasearch Organisation plans to ask the United States for permission to set up a satellite contacting station in Alaska. In London the well-known artist Eric Landor was the victim of a hit and run driver. Mr. Landor was taken to St. Michael's Hospital. He has not yet regained consciousness. Frank? Oh, what's the matter? Why so jumpy? Words don't seem to be coming very easy this day. What you need is a drink. What? No, no thank you very much. I want to get home. Oh come on, just a quick one. No, thank you very much, George, I really must get on with this. Oh alright. Who is it? Who is it? Well, wherever you've been for the past few days, it's certainly improved your temper. Don't tell me he actually liked a painting for once. Well, I had a slight problem, but everything's alright now. That calls for a celebration. What are you going to have? No, no, no, the drinks are on me. Hey miss, please. The same again, will you please? I heard you calling a round, Frank. You know that's too good to miss. Yes. Please, have anything you want, anything at all. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Is he hurt bad? - He'll live. Yeah, but he'll be blind for the rest of his life. Poor guy. Still there's lots of things a blind man can do. A very pretty story. Thank you. It is not all the story. Then it's the same for all of us. What do you mean? Every time the cards have been asked how we could avoid the future, the answer is the same: death. That's a bad word, man. Well, let's see what the cards have to say about me. You are sure you wish to know? Deal the cards. The Empress. The Hermit. The Star. The Lovers. Oh, why this? It's an old American custom. Et ceci est une vielle coutume Francaise. Old French custom. Custom... - Coutume. Co... Cot... - Coutume... ... tume Non, coutume. Ü... - Ü... Coutume... Welcome to Pemberton, the prettiest little town in New England. I hope it likes me. Honey, it could not help but like you. You know, I was worried about coming with you to Amercia. You're going to get on just fine. Are you hungry? I'll go and see if there's something in the kitchen. Eat. You go and get acquainted with the house, okay? Au! Bob? I cut myself. The can opener. I'll wash it. No, no. Let me do it. Okay. You can have the car. Dr. Blake is going to come and pick me up anyway. Who is Dr. Blake? Dr. Blake? Dr. Blake is the only other doctor in town, and we work at the clinic together and he is gonna That'll be him now. Come on, honey. I know he wants to meet you. Hi. - Hi. Good morning. Good morning. Doctor, this is my wife Nicolle. Dr. Blake. Glad to know you. I hope you like our fair city. I'm sure I will. If there is anything I can ever do for you, don't hesitate to tell me. Thank you. All set? It was nice meeting you. Bye, honey. Drive carefully, eh? - I will. Bye. Well, as you say, it is a strange case. Sounds like anemia. No, no. It's not the quality of the boy's blood that's wrong. It's the quantity. I mean it's that there doesn't seem to be enough of it. The boy's in here. Do you want to see him? All right. Johnny, this is Dr. Blake. Hello. - Hello, Johnny. Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor. Dr. Blake just wants to have a look at you. Okay? Has Johnny been eating his food? Yes. Getting enough sleep, fresh air? Well, he always sleeps with his window open. Well, let's have a look. When did he get these? Just a few days ago. The day he complained he was feeling weak. All right. Thanks. Eh, will you wait in the other room? Come on, Johnny. Would you come this way, please? Yes, thank you. Well, what do you think? I don't know. I really don't know what to make of it. What do you think? I don't know. If these were medieval times, I'd I'd almost say he was the victim of a vampire. A vampire? Yes, that's what Dr. Blake said. Can you imagine in this day and age? He took some blood samples from the boy though and we should know by tomorrow morning what it really is. How will you know? Well, he'll work some tests on it in the laboratory tonight. He has a laboratory in the clinic? No, no. He has got a workshop on top of the old Finch building. He works there at night sometimes. He's a real lonely guy. You want some more steak, honey? No, no. Why did't it attack you then? I figured that out later. My arms made the sign of a cross as I raised them to shield myself. But how could it know that I suspected? Dr. Blake, your patient is ready. Did he sleep with his window open last night? That's not wrong, is it? He must have fresh air. No, no. It's not wrong. Leave it open. Only tonight I want to be there in case anything happens. Sweetheart? I got up to close the window. I cut my hand. Nicolle is my wife. Do you know what a vampire is? A spirit which takes up residence in a human body, conferring upon it the power to turn into a bat at night so that it can glut itself on the blood of innocent victims. And if the victim dies, he becomes a vampire and after death rises from the grave and walks the earth in search of blood. That would have happened to Johnny if he had died of Nicolle's bite. It may happen to her next victim. Tonight she will go in search of someone. Watch her. The only way to kill a vampire is to drive a wooden stake through its heart. Watch her! And when she returns Nicolle I love you. A vampire? It's true. I never heard anything so crazy in all my life. Look, Dr. Blake will confirm it when he gehts here. Confirm what? That my wife was a vampire. But that's nonsense. There are no such things as vampires. But you told me. You gave me the stake. She attacked you. I don't know what you are talking about. Nobody attacked me. Well, tell them please. Tell them! Cuff him! Tell them! Ok, let's go. Doctor, please. Can we give you a lift, Doctor? No, no thanks. I'll walk. Okay. This town isn't big enough for two doctors or two vampires. Nicolle Do you know someone by that name? I met her on the continent. I was thinking Turn the next card, please. Ave, aye, aye... There are five of us here and none of us has a future. What about him? - Yes, what about you? All of us. We're all together in this carriage and none of us has a future. It's this train - It's going to crash. What are you doing? - Pull the communication cord. Don't, you fool. For that way you might cause an accident. Sit down. We can't just sit here and wait. Why have you done this? What do you want? Who are you? Have you not guessed? We're slowing down. Is it Bradley? Can you see a sign? I don't know. Well, where else could it be? We've reached the end of our journey. No accidents. So much for Dr. Terror. Dr. Schreck.
