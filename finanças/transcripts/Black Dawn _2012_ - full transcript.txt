Are you hurt? What happened inside? What about the nuclear bomb? I don't speak Korean. The Korean Border: 5 months earlier Comrade Watch out! Hurry! Excellent! Good work! So this is Uranium? Let's cross the border. We'll sell it and split the money. South Korean scum. Gaiji Keisatsu (National Security Police) MOD investigators. No-Entry Zone Tohoku, Japan What's the agenda for the Nuclear Terrorism Conference in Seoul The Nuclear arms threat facing our world is more urgent than ever. Kumi Muramatsu, Chief Cabinet Secretary Given our nation's history, Japan must be resolute in grappling with this issue. Would you please comment on on the recent earthquake? Laser Research Laboratory Mutsu University When we finally received authorization We found information was already missing. A hard drive with classified data had been removed. Who would do that at a time like this? It's exactly times like this that provide an opportunity for interested parties. That's how this business works. Now Japan's cutting edge technology is out there, free for the taking. What was on that hard drive? Military security data. Uranium is missing? Since Bin Laden died, the CIA is nervous that terrorists will try to steal uranium. Shotaro Ariga, Cabinet Intelligence Agent Kurata Toshiki Head, NPA Security What is it? It hasen't been released yet, But today we learned that classified data was stolen from a university lab in the No-Entry zone. It concerned nuclear research. What miserable timing. Seoul South Korea I've lost him. National Intelligence Service, South Korea International Nuclear Terrorism Summit Preliminary Report 47 Heads of State will attend the Nuclear Terrorism Summit. We agree to share intel with the Japanese government to ensure security. I'd like to ask about the recent report by the CIA, I'm sure you know about it. It concerns the uranium theft. Jongsik Park NIS 1st Unit Deputy Rumors such as this are typical before summits. Rumors? I realize this might be a delicate matter but... Leave our nation's matters to us. We have 60 years experience with a war, that still hasn't ended. My apologies. I had hoped this exchange might be meaningful and not a mere formality. Subject has escaped. Refugee Support Center Sumimoto Kenji Field Agent, Cabinet Security How's business? No complaints. More refugees are defecting South everyday and business has dried up. Where is he? Isn't that just like a Japanese. Forget it. I'd like to keep living. So, how many girls have you sold to Japanese sex clubs recently? Do you want to keep your moneymaker? Matsuzawa Hina National Police HQ, Foreign Div. Excuse me. You wanted to see me? You have a special assignment. I want you to investigate Sumimoto. Excuse me, sir...? Don't tell me you forgot He's responsible for dragging you into this work. That bastard Secret Service agent. His recklessness got him kicked off the force--he's a menace. Please reconsider this assignment-- These orders come from the Prime Minister. Sumimoto returns today from Seoul. What is he investigating in Seoul? An global intelligence organization. I want you in it. Jo Masayoshi, second generation Korean-Japanese He was Japan's top nuclear Engineer. 26 years ago. Then he returned to North Korea to become the driving force in their nuclear development program. Please don't worry. I'm not an assassin. I'm with the Japanese police. I can only imagine how horrible your life has been these past 26 years. Not allowed to see your wife or daughter in Japan, And you've had to live in fear ever since you fled to North Korea. I humbly apologize that we did not come sooner to help you. I'm sorry. Please believe me. I've come to help. Come back with me to Japan. You must want to see your daughter. Did he agree? Yes, for his daughter. We have a Japanese passport ready. Watch out for the NIS. When I get back, I want a team I can trust. You can have your former group. They already have their orders. Thank you, sir. International Arrivals Haneda Airport, Tokyo Oh, sorry. You're being tailed by Korean NIS. Use your Korean passport at Customs. Would you please come with me? From there, you'll be in our jurisdiction. We're with MOD Counter-Intelligence This way, please. We're arriving now. You're safe now. Drive. Safe House Open your mouth. That's fine. Good. These men will guard you around the clock. You are our number one priority. Once you're rested, we'll begin treatment at the hospital. My cell number is on your phone. Call me any time night or day. He shows clear signs of radiation poisoning. He must have been exposed without protection. I'm waiting for the final results but he has late stage cancer and could die at any time. Quiet, please. Keep him alive as long as you can. Where is the doctor's daughter? We started an nationwide search. And the CIA? They sent these photos of a North Korean installation. Military vehicles enter the compound daily. We believe they took the uranium. What was in the stolen files? An advanced Pulse Laser system able to simultaneously detonate multiple nuclear implosion devices with 0.1 nanosecond accuracy. This device is the key. In the hands of a terrorist nation it could produce more powerful weapons of mass destruction than Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined. Foreign agents have used the confusion following the 3/11 earthquake as cover. Take no data at face value, Investigate any lead, no matter how remote. Check and recheck everyone. Yes, sir. If this uranium is less than 95% pure, this deal's off. Of course. Insa-dong District Seoul Look, Kotomi. Aren't they cute? I know you want one. I need some smokes. Alright, we'll wait here. Look, a festival. Is this the switch? Handle it carefully. And the uranium sample? It's been delivered. Time's running out. We want the device now. Right. Uh... Will I be paid for this...? Nevermind. Has she grown on you? I swear on my homeland, no. Never a Japanese woman. Welcome back, President. Everything oK? We got you a present. Thank you, ma'am. Watch him. -Yes, sir. Stay alert, they're dangerous. His name is Okuda Masahide, President of Okuda Trading. This is his wife, Kaori. He employs 3 South Koreans, One Chinese and one Thai. They have fairly profitable trade with several South Korean businesses. Customs says their shipping labels are vaguely marked and there are commercial invoice discrepancies. What's lmmigration say? His real name is Kim Jungsoo. He married Kaori 2 years ago and started this business. This May he became a Japanese citizen. He made several trips to South Korea with his family. They suspect he smuggles things in his carry-on luggage. Does she know? No. If he told her he'd risk exposure. I checked Kim's ICPO record. He's been sighted with enemy agents in Malaysia and Macau. Based on our intel, we believe Kim is a North Korean spy posing as a South Korean. How do you feel? Your attacker deliberately let you live. Consider it a warning. Sumimoto. This is a dare. They're challenging every one of our SP agents. Sorry to keep you. The laser detonator. It matches the stolen plan. Right. You look better, Doctor. The treatments must be working. You'll see your daughter soon. Don't lie. I was told that my wife and daughter were dead. In a car accident? The North Koreans always say that. But you must have suspected otherwise. That's why you came back to Japan. Look at this. Your family register. Your wife is confirmed dead. But read your daughter's portion after the words, "Missing" it says, "declared legally dead." Your daughter's death is unconfirmed. In cases like this, we believe she's alive. It's a standard procedure to create a new identity. a new identity? She was harassed for being your daughter. The year after you left for North Korea, this article came out. It said you stole Japanese nuclear technology for North Korea. It was hell for your family here in Japan. They moved constantly, always the target of harassment. People called them traitors. Your wife had your daughter declared legally dead. Can you understand that it was the only way they could live? Then later, Your wife committed suicide. I'm sorry. I'm not accusing you. The police are doing everything to find your daughter. We have some leads. We'll find her in no time. That was taken on the day you left Japan wasn't it? You'll see her again. You have my word. Hitomi, move so the boy can slide down. Oh, thank you! Yuta, what do you say? Thank you. Sorry. Please sit down. Is it his birthday or something? No, it's not. I just went a little crazy shopping. Oh, that's nice! I really shouldn't spoil him but I can't help it. We don't see each other much. Sorry. I didn't mean to pry. It's alright. Okuda Kaori. Born in 1985 She was abandoned outside an orphanage at age 1. Her parent's whereabouts are unknown. She began working in bars at 17. At 20, she married a man she'd met at the bar. One year later she had daughter Kotomi but her husband fled deep in debt. As the cosigner on his loans, she was liable for the debts. With no family support she worked in bars but her debts grew. After putting Kotomi in a children's home she married Kim 2 years ago. She got Kotomi back, but at 5, she still doesn't talk. A school counselor said it's due to trauma. I see. He lives in a children's home... Today I can see him But I don't know when I'll see him next. When I got divorced, I thought I could raise him alone. Now he's paying for my bad judgment. -Good night. -See you tomorrow. I'm back. We move on her tomorrow. Wait she's not ready yet - to be recruited... - It's good enough. I want Okuda Kaori. Come in. Thank you. Hello, ma'am. I'm Tamura, her boss. I didn't mention my job. I'm a police officer. Thank you. By marrying you, your husband got citizenship. He's using you so he can operate under the radar. It was all lies... ...the children's home... He's probably not even your child. - Unbelievable. - Wait. I have to pick Kotomi up. Let me help you, Kaori. I don't want your help. You know everthing, don't you? - I know nothing - Oh, right! A single mother deep in debt. Then one day some handsome Korean just shows up and proposes. You think that happens everyday? - You're just jealous! - So why does he pay you every month? - It's my salary! - Oh that's right, Payment for a sham marriage! - I don't need this shit. - You sold your citizenship, just to pay off your damn debts! Matsuzawa! Matsuzawa Step outside a moment. - No. - Now. Sorry about that. Won't you sit down? Not everyone understands the stress of debts. And part of you wanted to believe that you'd end up being a family. Since you were abandoned you've always wanted a family. After all, even a sham marriage could turn into a real family. At least that's what you hoped. But your husband doesn't feel the same way. You know that he'll abandon you both. Once a sham marriage, always a sham. We want to know what your husband acquired today. Will you look for us? a photo from your cell phone is fine. I can't! I trust my husband. But aren't you at all curious? about where he goes and what he does. We're willing to pay You could pay off your debts. our money's much cleaner than your husband's. You want to handle her? No, thanks. I really can't stand her. Matsuzawa. What emotion drives a person the most? anger. our job is to manipulate that anger to control the person. She's yours. So what was Kim hiding? We're confirming that with Dr. Jo. Report immediately when you know. Excuse me but, is there any progress with locating Dr. Jo's daughter? Jo's daughter? Yes. I doubt we'll ever find her now. His wife and daughter were under surveillance. Then the daughter vanished, we searched for her. We even brought the wife in. But she refused to cooperate. She ended up killing herself without telling us a thing. For the last 26 years, There's been no trace of her. She must be dead. That's what Sumimoto thinks too. Sorry to disturb you. We found your daughter. At first she seemed confused when I told her about you. But now she wants to meet you. These is her contact information. But I have a few questions first. You know what this is? I know you do. They are laser detonators. And together with weapons-grade uranium you'll have an a-bomb. You also know that uranium was smuggled out of North Korea. At almost exactly the same time that you defected to South Korea. I think the two are connected somehow. You know where the uranium is. Doctor, We're losing valuable time. We must stop the terrorists from acquiring that uranium. I know you're not afraid of death. So why won't you tell us? What are you trying to protect? You should be protecting Japan where your daughter is living. I've seen that look before. On the faces of SP agents when they lie to you. Tell me, what you are trying to protect? National interests? Do you have any idea what those precious interests are that you so desperately protect? Answer me! Doctor What's wrong? Doctor Is he alright? Give him the truth drug. But that might... He'll die anyway. You're telling me a nuclear weapon is being built in Japan? Do you understand the implications of this? Calm down, Ms. Secretary. The detonators are under our surveillance. What does America say about this? or South Korea? or China? Intelligence agencies do not usually meddle in each other's affairs. Reprehensible! You're just covering your asses in case you mess up! Japan cannot have nuclear weapons at any time. And especially after the 3/11 earthquake. As for those detonators... Seize them. Chief We're getting a search warrant for Okuda Trading. Do we want backup? Chief? Call it off. - Sir? - But... We want them to lead us to the uranium. We'll use Kaori. President? Still working? Do you know who did it? I'll handle this. Leave it to me. Thank you for coming. You did well the other day. Thanks to you, we have valuable evidence. Here's your next assignment. This must be attached to the bag. It's a transmitter. - Chief, wait. this is dangerous... - Stay out of this! - But... - There's no place on my team for a narc! Get out! It's a simple task, don't be nervous. I'm leaving. There's no going back now. You have to do this. - I can't. - Yes, you can. I'll double the money. You're terrible. Terrible? Us? What's funny? Stop playing the good mother. I know what you really are. You said Kotomi doesn't talk because your husband's leaving traumatized her. But she wasn't even 2 when that happened. Is that really the cause? What do you mean? You forgot to tell the counselor everything. Why is Kotomi always smiling? Why does she never talk back to you? Why does she hang on to your skirt even in the toilet. Why? Why do you think she never lets go of her scruffy toy? Shall I help you remember? Under the pressure of childrearing and debts, you left Kotomi in the car on a hot summer day. When you came back 6 hours later she was unconscious and nearly dead from dehydration. It wasn't because her Dad left, it was you! She's scared that you'll leave her if she misbehaves. Shut up or...I'll kill you. That's right. This is what you really are. Go on, hate me! You can pretend to be someone else but it can't erase your past. Use that anger for a better future. Be what you are. That's all you have to do. What is it? You're Ang Minchul, a Korean Japanese. You're under arrest for stealing an umbrella 3 days ago. That's where you should've stabbed me if you wanted me dead. Do it right or not at all. Hurts doesn't it? You clueless fuck. You're in over your head. Can't you see that? Get out. Thank you. You sure he's sedated? Yeah. Make sure the transmitter can't be seen. Follow my instructions. It's gone. The locker's empty. Abort! Get out of there Kaori! It must be here somewhere. Go back, now! I couldn't find Kotomi's name tag... I think she was playing here and lost it... What's wrong? What you're looking for isn't here anymore. You'll never find it. Ang Minchul took it somewhere safe. So much is on my mind everyday that sedatives no longer affect me. Speak Japanese! It was you... I trusted you. You lied to me! Why? Why did you do it? Hands up! Let her go! Kim Jungsoo! You don't want to kill her. You won't kill Kaori. You don't want to do it. We have Ang in custody. Let it go. We can protect you both. Minchul...? Why...? Drop the gun! You almost fucked everything up! Call the South Korean embassy. What's going on? He's an operative. He's NIS. An undercover South Korean agent. Where are the detonators? Up there. Safe in a diplomatic pouch. Tell me something. Was the uranium ever in Japan? Do us a favor. Keep out of this or you'll just mess things up again. Cuff me! I'm truly sorry for how things turned out. When the employees come in to work please tell them this. The President had a stroke and is in ICU. You want me to lie to them? Yes. His orders? Fuck him! How will you pay your debts? If you walk away now, Kotomi will go right back to the facility. You know he'll do it. My apologies. The NIS probably knows that the uranium is in South Korea. They'll use the detonators to get to the uranium. Secretary, South Korea has humiliated us on a global scale. We need to pressure their government. That's not necessary. I think things turned out very well. We are obviously unequipped to handle a nuclear arms crisis. I realized that when I saw your actions. We're lucky that this didn't happen in Japan. - But, Secretary... - Yes? Our technology was used on that detonator. If Japan were implicated in nuclear arms development, It would mean disaster to our international reputation. Can't you cut a deal for the release of their NIS agent? You think you can do whatever you please? When did you come here? Before the uranium incident? Is the NIS behind this? You ask too many questions. Did you have to kill Kim? If I hadn't, your informer would be dead. Kim never would've killed Kaori. You knew that. You were his friend, weren't you? You think that matters? Someone abducted the doctor. Either the North or the NIS. Gimpo International Airport, Seoul The detonators? They're here. Well done. Agent Yu Teha. Kim arranged a rendezvous. I'll deliver the detonators and locate the uranium. Our national security is in your hands. Everything depends on you, Ang Minchul. Follow me. Sir, it's Choi Gilsun. The ex-military official who defected to the South with his men. Stay on him. Deploy the SWAT team. Check the contents. I know who you are. That last one was NIS too, right? And you'll die just like him... ...for the nation. We've learned of an explosion in Seoul. Thankfully, it wasn't nuclear. A SWAT team may have been taken out. The South Koreans haven't confirmed it but, They've obviously failed. Dr. Jo? I know it's you. It's me. Where are you now? Crossing the border. Thank you. It was a beautiful dream. What are you doing? Doctor! Where are you going? Seoul. Someone's manipulating Dr. Jo. Sumimoto! It's over, you failed. We're off this case now for political concerns. Sumimoto! Don't forget our responsibility is to protect the national interest. But, sir... I'm an SP agent. Am I just supposed to forget? If you keep pushing this You'll be out of the goverment and the police. The detonators are ready. You assemble the bomb and we'll sell it to the terrorists. This way. Dr. Jo. - I'll get it. - Wait. We are unable to answer now. Leave a message after the tone... Sumimoto, pick up. I know you're there. I thought you were dead. Go to Kim's room. Check inside the walls. What? Just do it. Kim hid a box there. That I was to give to Kaori, if anything happened. It's what you've been looking for. And... there's a secret e-mail account. His people use to communicate. What do you want? What? NIS doesn't give intel for free. Damn it. This isn't about the NIS. It's about protecting my country. Found it. - Have this examined now. - Right. Your husband's will. It was addressed to you and Kotomi. Our life together in Japan changed me. I'm leaving some money for you both. I'm a traitor now and my life is in danger, But I have no regrets. The time I spent with you two, was the happiest in my life. I wish we could've been a real family. What did he mean about being "a traitor"? Any ideas? Anything? This is a work of art. Wonderful. You've done well. Where's the switch? Here. What? Something wrong? This isn't what I asked for. Kim Jungsoo...! Bring Kim to me! It's like a cell phone. you activate it with a serial code it transmits a radio wave. Too complicated, I'm completely lost. Just think of it as a remote. This is why your husband was a traitor. When he realized what he was doing, he got scared and kept the remote. So why tell me? Because they'll come looking for him if they think he's alive. Sir, we intercepted an e-mail. "This is your chance to redeem yourself. Bring it to the usual place tomorrow." Where's the usual place? - But, sir... - Shut up! Sir! You think I'd do this? Are you completely insane? If it weren't for you none of this would've happened! Not to me, my daughter, or my husband! We would all still be together. Now you listen to me. I'm not taking any more orders. No one's going to "run" me. You were the one who told me to be my "real" self. Come here, honey. You see, I didn't have a daddy either. So I really wanted you to have a nice dad. But... It was all Mommy. Mommy blames everyone except herself. But I'm sorry, honey. Mommy was wrong. But Kotomi, Mommy promises that she'll never go away! No matter what Mommy will be there for you. We'll be together always We'll always have each other, Kotomi. Things will be alright. Isn't this Dr. Jo's file? What's this letter? Jo wrote it to his wife from North Korea. I am thankful to my glorious homeland. The ideal environment has enabled me to immerse myself in my work. My laboratory facilities are excellent. Equal to any that I had in Japan. Developing our nuclear power program will not only enrich our nation, but also make the world a better place. This was what I vowed the day I left Japan when we stood under that flowering cherry tree. How is Yoko? She must be as lovely as you by now. One day I will come back for you just as I promised. Then you'll understand that what I did was right. Yours, Masayoshi It would appear that you misread Dr. Jo's motives. He went back to North Korea for his family's sake. You thought he'd do anything to see his daughter again. even though he knew it was impossible. People call you "that heartless SP bastard." But you're just pathetic. You're weak and soft. You're the one who was manipulated! Why do you think we couldn't find his daughter? But you thought she was dead. I've never thought that for a moment. The truth is hard to predict. DNA results. Jap bitch! Fuckin' Jap! You wanna die? Where is it? Where's the switch? Give it to me now! Kotomi! I'll kill you! Bring it to Seoul and the girl lives. - Kotomi! - Jap bitch! Kotomi! Kaori, we're doing everything we can to find your daughter. We made the vehicle and will find who did this. It's just a matter of time. Give me the switch. I need to take it to Seoul. You don't need to. We'll save Kotomi! Fuck you! You want me to go, don't you? This switch, activates a nuclear bomb. - Yeah, so? - If they get it, Seoul is finished! - And? - And you'll go with it! I don't care! I'm taking back my daughter! You abandoned her before. But now you want her? That's why... I'll never make that mistake again! Effective today, you're no longer with the SP. Thank you for everything. Our job is to protect our nation's borders. Once you cross over, you're on your own. The border is the one thing I never could cross. This is the best I can do for you. I'm obliged. Your people are behind this. No, this is an NIS scenario. Why don't we work together? You have an ace up your sleeve? Kaori, there's something I need to tell you. Please read these before you go. What is this? Give me back my daughter! Where's Kim? Give me the switch. Now! The switch! If this is a decoy, shoot her. Sit her there. Sit! Is this it? Dr. Jo. Freeze! Who are you? We disabled the transmitter! It's over. Kill them both! Search the area! Dr. Jo. Leave the bomb and surrender. Doctor, it's over. Over...? Nothing's over. I'm not like those others. My purpose... ...is to change the world. He's going to blow himself up! Bomb squad! Everyone else evacuate!! It's useless. It will detonate in a few minutes. When it finishes charging, it will go off automatically. Evacuate. Everyone evacuate. Take Kaori and get out! Disable it. What's the cancel code? Give me the code! He's mad... He's insane. I'm perfectly sane. It's you who are insane. Doctor! I thought you hated your country. - That's right. - Then, why? I think you can guess why. A terrorist act in South Korea will naturally lead to war. Global retaliation against my country will be swift. The country will be utterly obliterated. There are other ways. Why this? Why? Indeed. Do you think you can reason with them? You have no idea what it's really like there. How could you possibly understand? Many of my assistants died. Some would come to the lab wearing nothing but a shirt. They touched uranium completely unprotected. I constantly gave them gloves and boots to wear. But they would just sell them to buy food. Choi and his men were no different. Blinded by money, they wanted to sell the bomb to terrorists. This is reality. Do you see it? Do you!? This bomb is holds the souls of my dead assistants. The final hope of those who led lives of suffering. This is your daughter. I can easily tell, if she's mine or not. Kim took her as hostage, so you wouldn't betray them. The daughter that your wife gave her very life for. Wasn't your dream to build nuclear power plants? That's right. So that every house in the nation could have electric heat. You promised mother and me under that cherry tree that you'd build a nation where we could be together. You promised. Mother waited her whole life believing that you'd come back. But you never did. In the end you didn't change a thing. They put me in an orphanage and mother finally killed herself. After that, nothing ever worked out for me. I wanted to hate you but you weren't even around for me to hate! And so I just kept it all inside. Just to prove that I didn't need you to be happy. It's all that kept me going. But children can't ever really hate their parents, even though they deserve it! I'm sorry. It's not too late. Let's go home. Doctor. Survival was your priority. But now it's time to be the man you were under that cherry tree again. All of this, It isn't the kind of hope you want. Thank you. But I'm still the same man that I was then. All I ever wanted was to make a better world. Run... Run! Are you hurt? What happened inside? What about the nuclear bomb? I should never have trusted you. You're too gullible. We trust because we understand each other. That's the only thing that will save the world. It may sound lame but that's all we've got. Show me that you're right. Make me trust you until the end. Cancel? Cancelled. This way. Little girl, are you alright? Welcome back. Your daughter is waiting for you. Everthing's alright now. It's alright. Ma..ma? When politican's say things like this they are usually mocked for being idealistic. But here is some idealism for you. At the upcoming Summit Japan willingly risks mockery by declaring to the world that we have a dream of a world free of atomic energy. We're determined to make it a reality. Any mention of Korean-Japanese engineers and Japanese technology must be kept a secret. We'll do our best. That's not good enough. This is an NIS operation. The North built a compact A-bomb. So we plan to steal it Using ex-military to transport the uranium... We sincerely hope you would never use a nuclear hoax as a pretext for starting a nuclear arms program... Absolutely not. Would you? Of course not. It's from the security budget. Thank you, sir. So tell me, What happened to that SP bastard? A higher-up asked the CIA to intercede to bring him back to Japan. You could put him back on the Force. He might still be useful. No. I can't stand his face. Tell me. Were those DNA test results real? DNA paternity testing - Negative Damn, Japs!
