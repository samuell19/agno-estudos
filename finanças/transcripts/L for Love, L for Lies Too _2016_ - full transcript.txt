Is it you then? Good morning, Fanny Morning Who's in charge of presenting today? Come on, do I need to invite someone to do so? It's me Hello everyone, I am Tracy Didn't you guys say you would wait for me? Good morning Boss Morning I would like to know why you didn't wait for me, Fanny Aren't you in a hurry? Of course I am, I have many meetings afterwards I'm not like you, you can wake up late for work So? Do you need breakfast? Yes, please Let's have breakfast together, I'll pay for it Let's not disturb Fanny's meeting Boss, it's alright to have breakfast alone But you had to ask them for breakfast together Are we having a meeting or a party now? Times are difficult, so please behave yourself What do you mean, Fanny? - I... - Did you forget? You prayed to Phra Phrom for a son last year You promised to stop using foul language Now that your son is born, are you going back to the old way? How dare you, Fanny I'm not going to fuss about it this time, you happy now? So-and-so, start the presentation Hello everyone, this is Tracy I... "Fanny, let's break up!" Hello everyone, this is Tracy Shut up "I don't love you! I don't love you! I don't love you!" Why are we still ordering takeaway? Let's eat out. Come on Let's go - Are you really going? - Of course -But I brought my lunch box -Chop chop "Three hours later" Why did he break up with me? - What are you doing? - Why did he leave me? I'll change, alright? -I don't know anything -Why can't he tell me? -I don't know him -What did I do wrong? Just go away Why did he break up with me? I can help you call the police, HELP One minute... give me another minute and I'll die I will cling onto him even if I turned into a ghost Then why are you clinging onto me now I won't let him off even if I were a ghost, never ever Please let me off... Not even in death would I let him off I won't let him off even if I were a ghost I won't let him off Help... there is so much blood Are you sure you don't need to go to the hospital for a check-up? No, thanks Alright then Bo, are you alright? - Going home to rest? - No need... What did Fanny say to you just now? She was fine, why did she commit suicide? She... didn't say anything Didn't you guys know? Fanny must have killed herself because of relationship problems What do you know, hurry up and tell us I heard Fanny was shopping in IFC She saw her boyfriend holding hands with a girl in Lane Crawford Fanny was furious, she slapped the girl It was posted in the group before It's my fault If I hadn't gone inside earlier We can visit her grave together next year But it's such a deep wound Even if she survived, there would not be much point That "Killer Whale" was normally unbeatable. How would one have guessed she would commit suicide due to relationship problems The University of Michigan recently published a research report the article mentioned that before Valentine's Day and Christmas Many couples would argue over travels, marriage and other issues Arguments lead to break-ups I think this reasoning is a bit farfetched Kid you're just too young Everything in this world is just an illusion What you see may not be the truth While truth may not be seen easily You're right Just say I'm ignorant I'm ordering dessert, you want some? I haven't finished - Yes? - Have you not heard before Lovelorn can be contagious I've never heard of that The more people around you breaking up or the more people mentioning break-ups Then it will gradually affect people around you You will also break-up in the end You idiot, I wouldn't I don't believe it You don't want dessert, I'll have it Bo, I haven't finished Have you heard of the Murphy's theory? - Mur... what? - Murphy's theory Anything that could go wrong will always go wrong in the end That is to say, bad things, Even if its chance of occurrence is 0.1 percent It will happen in the end How is it related to break-ups then In this world, bad things are ubiquitous Bo, you look pallid and your hair is a mess Are you sick? I am fine You're so late, we are done Sorry When I was about to close, a client walked in for an extraction He looked like he was in pain, so I extrated his tooth for him You make it sound like ER To put it bluntly you're just in it for the money How are you going to spend with all the money you earn I want to earn more money so that I could go see the aurora with my future wife Don't assume I would be free You got me wrong, I didn't say I'm going with you What did you say? Vincent, that's enough Who are you going with if not me? Just kidding Don't be so angry alright? I've bought the flight and cruise tickets, even the hotel rooms are already booked If you stand me up I'll tie you up and grab you with me I'll send you the information in a few days' time Still in a meeting, can't pick you up, you go home first! Sorry! Is my brother coming or not? He can't make it, it's fine, I can leave on my own He is in name and in reality a truant Breaking appointments all the time, as if he's afraid of being made to pay for the meal He's busy, I can pay. It's just the same Sister, you are so good to me I want to give you a hug now It's too far, let's hug next time Why don't I pay this time, you've always paid for the bill No need It's just a small amount, it's fine That's right When you and my brother get married I swear to God My red pocket will be far more generous than all the meals she had treated me Take your time to save up money Still far from now Would your words make Bo unhappy? I was just kidding How would I know she would take it so seriously Your brother seemed to have dragged it on too long with Bo Yes. It puts me in such a dilemma As her friend, I think she should break up with my brother But if she breaks up with him I'm worried I would lose her as a friend This question is just like dividing 1 by 3 Always endless Hello? Brother? What? I will be back right now What's happening? Dad's threatening Mum with divorce What should we do Let's go home first, then we figure out what to do Brother, it's good to have you back We couldn't persuade them - Dad, what's happening? - Nothing Tonight is the happiest night since I was born What on earth are you happy for? Be honest, are you having an affair with another woman? You're going to pack and run away with her? I emphasize once more I do not have any affair with any woman I'm going to the Yellow Mountain to take scenery photographs with my classmates Do you think I'm so naive? You think I don't know? You guys are going north for prostitutes Photo taking? I've never seen you pick up a camera don't be like this Can't I have such interest now? Can't I pick it up now? Is it wrong to learn new things? Look at you Playing mahjong and gossiping with those bitches all day long, that's the right way to go? Dad, stop arguing How about this, why don't we go home first Let's wait for Dad to come back, then we will figure it out There's no need I'll stay at my friends' place tonight Aren't you admitting that you have a mistress? I'm asking you, who's that bitch? Where are you going to sleep with that bitch? Where are you going - with that bitch? - Calm down, Mum! Where are you sleeping with that bitch? Of course I have a mistress, you know her too The security guard Mr. Wong who works at the opposite building Happy now? I'm leaving -Dad -Dad You are hopeless, for God's sake You like men? Such a pervert! Stand right there, I dare you to leave If you walk away now, then do not come back anymore Listen, you guys I've decided to divorce your mother -Dad -Dad Please let me finish my words this time Maybe you don't understand why I am doing this I make it clear now I have wanted to divorce your mother for 10 years But you three were still too young But now it's different You three are grown-ups, earning a living I've discharged my responsibilities as a father Mum At this age, I don't want to make myself suffer I've been depressed for many years I have to treat myself better I need to find myself again Kuen, I've prepared enough money for you Enough for you to continue playing mahjong After all, we were a couple I want this to end well, we are no enemies. We could be friends You wish How can we be friends You are so ungrateful Were it not for my father, you would still be a delivery boy You think you could marry a princeling like me? You think you could be a boss now? You have no conscience You aren't going to die well, Karma will get you -You will suffer from a stroke -Mum I also have something to announce I'm telling you, it is I who wants a divorce with you now Let's see whom the three kids will follow? You say Mum You know I'm used to living alone My place is small, I can't welcome you -Hey -Isn't it right You never liked my husband You don't wanna live with him, right? -Mum -Is there any justice? Mum All the sacrifice I made to bear and raise you Now I am in need, yet none of you extend a hand Mum, stand up first okay? Dad -I don't wanna live -Don't be like this This is catastrophic! Lovelorn is indeed contagious! Vincent's parents are getting a divorce! It's all because of you! How does that have anything to do with me? You think too much! Better safe than sorry, you be careful! You might be next!

I can save money, and can... And can have a free maid too, right? Of course not, you know I'm their boss They work for me, if I don't treat them better why would they work their hardest for me? It's just like how you love me dearly, and I would in return love you with all my heart Sun You invited us to watch football Why didn't you buy us some snacks too? There's no food at our place? How about this, I'll go and buy some pork bone congee for you Thanks sis You see how much they respect you?

There're only three questions every time we have dinner When will you get married? Don't you ever plan for marriage? Why are you dating if not for marriage? Oh my God, interrogating me like a criminal So now what? Are we going or not? I did want to go, but I really can't make it this time Something big will happen this year You know it too, I was never invited to the company Autumn festival barbecue before It's different this year, boss specifically requested me to go Isn't this a good opportunity for advancement? How would you choose between your mum and my boss Of course I would choose the boss Why? Because he's the one who pays my salary She wants me to have dinner with her alone again If she doesn't bother you, she bothers me What are you scared of? She's your mum, it's not like she would bite you Remember to send her my regards She's so stingy Where are you going, didn't you say you are tired? I feel too hot after taking a hot bath I'm going to play TV games for a bit, you take your time Bo, boss posted promotion notice Quick, come and see We all have faith in you You need to treat us dinner if you get promoted I will wait for you outside Congratulations Told you the promotion would go to you -Thank you -Congratulations Let's shake hands, you're awesome - You're amazing! - It's nothing Treat us dinner I heard that someone saw Sammy having dinner with boss at Soho two days ago and wore the same outfit for work the next day You say it, just dinner? I don't believe it You're smarter than her, nicer than her How come she got promoted? Mum What's the time? Sorry, I finished work late just now Sun? Where's he? He has other commitments He asked me to send his apologies Is he really that busy? Or he doesn't want to see me? Where's Lily? Should we order something first? Put down the menu, I haven't finished Why did your boss decide to promote Sammy but not you? How did you know? I have their Facebook You are the only one who didn't dare to add me as a friend Everyone in the company added me So I know everything that happens in the company But I really don't understand You are more qualified, more experienced Why did you lose to her? I lost because I'm not a liar, and I'm not a brown noser I don't flirt or flaunt What kind of attitude is this? You lost but you blame others for it Shouldn't you be reflecting on yourself, why you aren't as good as others? I lose to others in all aspects Whatever I do is wrong Happy now? I admit it This is your strength You pull a long face once someone makes a critical comment on you This character is in my blood, I can't change it You say that one more time You are already in your 30s Your work is worse than others You have a pathetic boyfriend A lifetime is a long time What plans do you actually have? As you said, I'm already in my 30s I can handle my own business I won't beg for your help even if anything happens I won't ever make you feel ashamed, you happy now? I wish everything you said would hold true You don't listen to me now Don't ever expect my help if you are in trouble If I really got into trouble, you would be the first one to disappear Had I ever? When I was in primary three, I stayed in hospital for a week because of gastroenteritis You didn't visit me even once I needed to work at that time Otherwise how would I have money to raise you? I didn't even have time to sleep Or were you afraid of people finding out that you have a daughter? Did I not raise and nurture you? Who paid your tuition throughout these years? I didn't let you call me mum? You only revealed that you have two daughters after you retired I just called you Elaine before 15 Sorry, I have already tried to come as soon as possible Mum, sister Why didn't you order any food? Why are you so late? It is because of the director Filming in every detail and every angle Work has no end Fortunately, I told him I have a dinner date today with my mother for Mid-Autumn So he allowed me a 2-hour break Thank you, Elaine So you have to go back to work afterwards? Then let's order some food quickly, what do you want to eat? I'm good with anything, you make the call sis Why are you in a trance? Why are you not ordering? Your sister still needs to go back to work Right, I almost forget Look Mum, you sure I can wear your necklace in the concert? It's your first concert How could you not have an heirloom with you I love you, mum Let's try it on Sure, please help me put it on Bo, why are you here by yourself? Are you talking to me? You can't recognize me? I'm Maggie, Sun's colleague I remember now, Maggie Why are you here by yourself? Today is Mid-autumn festival, Sun didn't come with you? Your boss is treating you all barbeque, didn't you go? My boss went overseas for a meeting yesterday I dated someone, I have to go Where're you? Why are you not picking up the phone? Are you still having barbecue? Call me back when you're free She looks so old-fashioned Indeed. Just look at her -Come on, let's head over there -Okay That's not bad. Good game! Where are you now?

How about this, I'll ask my friend to bring me some money now... it won't be long You're so lucky Someone paid the bill for you who paid for me? We often have customers who get drunk and forget to pay My boss found a solution from the internet He would ask good-willed customers to pay for an extra drink for whatever reason, as a treat or as an insurance for himself All in all, it conveniences us at others' expense a pack of cigarette please, keep the change He is the good guy What? She lost her purse and doesn't have money to pay the bill I told her you paid for it Thank you Not a big deal I usually forget to pay when I get drunk So usually I pay extra drinks, just in case But this is the first time I'm buying a drink for a girl Do you want another one?

Sorry, me too There's been some issues between me and my girlfriend I couldn't find her, it is her birthday today She is getting married soon, don't you want her to be well? Don't be so upset Because her mum despised me for being poor If I were rich, I could be with her If she comes back to you because you're rich She isn't a fine woman either Her mum controls everything She doesn't mind my meager background, she never looked down on me Louis, boss asked whether you're done chatting yet He's waiting for you It's late, I have to go Thanks for your drink tonight, I will buy you a drink next time If you want to thank me Actually you don't need to wait for next time I have something that I need your help tonight Can you see the fat guy inside the room?

Do I look like I want your broken watch? You talk too much, I'll kill you first then I like her watch If you like it I'll buy you another tomorrow Why do I need to wait till tomorrow if I can have it now? Because I said I'm killing her now Why don't we take the watch first and then kill her? -I'll do it now -Take the watch first -Do it -Take the watch first -Do it first -Watch -I need to do it now -I said take the watch first -Do it -Watch Bro, your gun... What gun? Imma kill you now -Wait -Why wait? I need to kill her -Nine -Who's calling for me -Busted -What? Your gun What? Damn it, I told you not to use a water pistol It's fine to use a water pistol, but why did you actually fill it up with water? Otherwise, the pistol would not have much weight and I would not be able to get in character My acting teacher taught me to use props to help me get into character How many times have I told you? If you want to learn acting, you must go to APA like I did Don't learn from ways which are neither here or there My teacher graduated from APA too Your senior He's also an award winner, last name is Wong He is good Your teacher hasn't done much acting these days? It's you fat boy again, we failed again Why didn't you just let me be the one to hold the pistol? Why did you insist on holding the pistol? How dare you complain? Told you not to eat anything today, you still had a bowl of noodles before you went out Why did you say you're hungry just now? I couldn't feel you were hungry at all, you made me unable to get into it It's not important whether I was hungry or not You touched your nose, that's the key Why did you scratch your nose? It's too obvious Why are you complaining? You were only acting as a prostitute today I never said I was set to be a prostitute Why did you say I'm a prostitute? How are you not a prostitute when you are dressed like this? Does it make me a prostitute just because I'm dressed like this? Stop arguing alright? Let's go eat something, my treat Okay, where? You guys decide, wait for me outside Let's go for hotpot No, Chiuchow food Whatever Wing and Keung, let's go together Would you put on more clothes? Do not think your acting is better just because you wear less clothes, it's all very proper, we aren't filming porn Can you explain to me what actually is going on? Next time you feel down, don't come to an unscrupulous shop like this You won't be so lucky every time Wouldn't you be afraid if I reported to the police? Did you lose anything? I saw you were having fun just now Is this your first time you encountered a swindler This is for you, keep it as a memento That's enough, it's late already You're such a bro But it'd be no use when you face strangers Good Morning Good morning, sweetie Hey, where's Mary? She just broke up, had an argument with her boyfriend She committed suicide by taking a hundred sleeping pills She's now in the hospital getting her stomach pumped What about me? I have to drink Mary's coffee before going to work There are no problems that can't be solved -Bing -Yes? One latte macchiato, quick What? Okay Wow - What? - It's disgusting And this isn't macchiato, this is flat white Flat white guarantees me bad luck Is it that serious? Don't be scared, I will personally brew another cup for you No need... I'm in a hurry, ask Mary to come back quickly Otherwise I won't visit your cafe again Chun, you have to tell me honestly My friend told me, he saw you were hanging with another guy in the cinema Who is he? You are still denying it? My friend sent me some pictures Do you need me to send you? Arguing again? What? You would break up with me if I don't trust you? You want to break up? Break if you wish, but don't regret it No way, another break up? Miss, where did you say you wanna go? Kowloon Bay I'm such a good guy, are you really breaking up with me? You will regret this You will definitely regret this Driver, where're you going? Causeway Bay right? I said Kowloon Bay What? I asked whether you wanted to take the cross-harbour tunnel, you told me to take the eastern harbour crossing I did not say that! Are you saying I wronged you? Driver, have you lost your lover or lost your mind? You breached the regulations, I will report you I'm now reporting you Where's my phone? Bitch, you say crap about me Go find someone else to send you cross harbour Am I that unlucky? I haven't saved the documents yet Don't you think I've been extremely unlucky today Not really, look what I got you! But have you got the dates wrong? Why is the date this year's? It's right, it's this year We are getting married next year. If we go honeymoon this year it doesn't make sense, right? Laura, let's get married this year okay? No, this year is a "blind year", misfortune will land on people like me who are born in the year of the sheep Mak Ling Ling said I would get into big trouble if I get married this year But Mak Ling Ling said my home is prone to attacks from the spirits of the evil vixen We to do something festive to flush out the bad aura My mum told me if we got married, dad would come back Is your Mak Ling Ling, and my Mak Ling Ling, the same Mak Ling Ling? The one who is chubby, loves to dress in pink, short-haired, and wears glasses? Wait So you are saying, you are marrying me because your mum wants you to? So you don't really want to marry me? You misunderstood, I really want to marry you It has nothing to do with my mum If you want to marry me, and I want to marry you too Then let's get married next year, why must it be this year? There's no difference between getting married this year or next And if we get married this year we could make my mum happy It's a win-win situation, isn't it better? Vincent, let me make myself clear I hate people disrupting my plans Everything you did tonight, was to make your mum happy You never thought for me Laura I told you it's not like this Why don't you let me explain If you wish so much for your parents to get back together Then find someone else to marry you But this person will not be me Men are like this You put foie gras right before them, and they don't cherish They just like to fool around Dump him Actually I ain't sure yet We've been together for so long, letting go is much easier said than done Men aren't like fixed deposits You don't get interest simply by putting money in the account I will visit again in a few days You can't in a few days' time Why? Are you closing down? No, I will go Chengdu to see pandas and watch Big Bang in Korea Lastly I will go to New Zealand for two weeks before coming back You know how to live a good life, Auntie Yin I have no children, husband or lover I earn and spend my own money Women's youth is just like money If you save and don't spend, it will only depreciate So sometimes we need to splurge, we need to treat ourselves better Surprise? Baby, what's going on? You don't like the flowers? Why are you giving me flowers? Are you guilty of anything? In fact, there's one thing I have lied to you for a long time I didn't go barbeque with boss on that night of mid-autumn I knew that a long time ago You knew it? How? The reason how I knew it isn't important anymore You have to tell me honestly I'm already mentally well prepared I can tell you the truth But you have to promise me you won't get upset It's my bad, I should have discussed with you before seeing her Discuss? How can you discuss this kind of things? You're my girlfriend, other than you who else should I discuss it with? You're so funny What room of discussion is there for this kind of things? You are shameless Shameless? How shameless is it to go to a job interview? Job interview? Just a job interview That night, a boss from Mainland flew to Hong Kong just to see me But he wants me to go to Shanghai for 3 months, then work on-the-move between different cities But trust me, I'll behave I won't be out drinking like how I used to be I'll save up some money, we'll get married and have babies Your mum won't be able to complain no more Why? Why are you crying? Start missing me now? Are you missing me already? I won't leave, alright? Stop crying Why? It's not like I'm not coming back! Everything is alright I thought you don't want me anymore - How come? Why would I? - I was afraid... Silly girl. Don't worry I promise you, I would not play around in mainland I promise you, I won't fool around while I'm in Mainland You like salmon I know that's your favourite Who introduce you to this restaurant? Who introduced you to this restaurant? Man, he's a foodie What? Let's go watch a movie Okay, which one? Hey there, food is here Thanks My meeting tonight is going to run till late, don't wait up - Okay? - Okay -You take the umbrella -No You take it, it will rain heavier after meeting -Heavy rain -No, you take it I take it then Okay... I will be back home soon -You be careful, love you -Be quick -Call me -Bye Why are you following me? Jolly well done, you managed to get a new boyfriend in a flash He is my boyfriend We have been together for 7 years - Reconciled? - one of your business You haven't answered me yet, why are you stalking me You don't own this street I sent my wife back just now This street is so quiet, I'm worried about your safety Wife? Didn't you see while you were in the restaurant just now? You two didn't exchange a word throughout the whole dinner I thought you two didn't know each other We've been married for so many years, it's quite normal to have nothing much to say The street is so quiet it's really dangerous Your boyfriend is happy to leave you behind, he treats you too badly And you said you aren't stalking me? I said I'm worried This area is dangerous Okay, I'll accompany you What's up? A swindler trying to do good deeds hoping to cancel out some bad karma? Truth be told I knew your boyfriend is not a good guy the first moment I laid my eyes on him Mr. Swindler, what makes you the one to judge? Actually, I do have a name Call me Louis We are in the public, it's not a very proud thing to be openly called a swindler, is it Let's talk about your boyfriend, is he being weird these days? For example, cheating on you? Enough, how many times have I told you not to bad-mouth my boyfriend Also, I won't believe what a swindler says Okay, let's play a game I can prove to you that I know what you are thinking Pointless If I didn't get it wrong You still have with you the chips from that night Left pocket Great This round doesn't count, the game officially begins now -Let's start -On the right Once more On the left -Once again -On the right How could this be? No matter in which hand you put the chips, I can guess it Why? When you want to fool someone You will feel guilty, and this guilt is what gives you away These clues will always be subtly revealed by your tell You thought you could fool me Yet you always peep on the hand with the chips Every time you do the same thing So if you want to fool people, the most important point is to cut out all your tells - Understand? - Again Left -You got it wrong -Great You corrected those flaws really quickly You would make a great swindler I'm a law-abiding person, why would I follow your footsteps to be a swindler You have a gift from God, don't waste it Join our league of swindlers You crazy? I'm serious You look silly, but it means people will lower their guards I observed you were very calm at the gambling game last time After tonight, I'm sure you have good potential Let's do it, if you don't mind I can be your master, I will teach you everything I don't have any money for you to con, don't think of taking advantage of me One more word and I'll call the police Do you have to take it so seriously and call the police? How about this, I have a job next week, I'll count you in. One go will hear you tens of thousands As an apprentice, this rate is top notch Taxi We have a deal. Next Friday, 9 pm Meet me at the shop we met last time, see you there and then Go home and take an early rest, see you next Friday Goodbye Please, it's not like he's not gonna marry you Just a year earlier, what's the problem? Why doesn't anyone understand? I hate people disrupting my plan Are you breaking up with Vincent because of this? He proposed on my most unfortunate day I think God is sending me a message What message? That I shouldn't be with Vincent I think you should go see a doctor Are you nuts? I thought you're my best friend who would understand me Now even you are saying I'm nuts You should reflect upon yourself, the whole thing started because of you Because of me? Ever since you told me about Fanny committing suicide People around me started to become lovelorn one by one All the bad things happened suddenly I guess these are just coincidences, -don't think too much -You're wrong There aren't that many coincidences in this world Otherwise why would Vincent and I get into such a state from where we were? You and my brother will break up too sooner or later Stop talking bollocks, don't scare me alright? Have you been in touch with Fanny at all? She even quit her job She seems to be resting at home now I bet you, be a good person Go and find her Why do I have to find her? It is for the doer to undo what he has done This whole thing happened because of her Once we found her, the truth will be clear My gut feeling is, this whole thing isn't that simple Why did the taste changed? I'm so unlucky Fanny, your home is very comfy These are my drawings I held an exhibition 10 years ago Are you thinking Such a devil like me, how can I be so artistic? Fanny, you are smart and capable, there's nothing you can't do Why were you so pessimistic that day? That day when my boyfriend broke up with me, he said exactly the same thing as you He said I'm tough, that there's nothing I couldn't do Even if he broke up with me, I wouldn't be too heart broken He felt I was too strong He said he wanted to find a sweeter and gentler girlfriend Let's talk about you, Bo The company decided to promote Sammy, did that upset you? What can I be upset about? Sammy is beautiful and knows how to get on the good side of people It's normal to promote her, it would be strange if they promoted me Have you ever wanted to compete with her? How could I compete? Do I need to date my boss for movies? Even if I were willing to, boss might not be I was referring to work performance, everyone knows you are capable You need to find a way to prove your value Fanny, I'm not as smart as you Honestly I don't know what my value is I've been working in this company for 10 years I don't get promotions, I don't know where my future lies You still have your boyfriend We have been together for 7 years Just like my job, I can't see a future either He treats me quite well But there are some questions that I can never ask him For example... When will you be done playing TV games? Can you chat with me? When are we going on a vacation together? When are we buying a flat? When are we getting married? He would throw a tantrum whenever he hears these questions I don't ask these questions, and life goes on peacefully Sometimes I think When in a relationship If there are so many questions that cannot be asked Does it mean that, this relationship is problematic? You know the answer, why are you still staying with him? Even if I seek for another, he might not be good either And it takes time to understand each other and develop a relationship It's very tiring Since I escaped death last time, I realised one thing Do you know what is it? If a person doesn't fear even death then everything else would become negligible Women at my age should treat ourselves better There's still such a long way to go in life We have to find an exit, not an excuse You're kind, good things will come to you Unlike me, I committed bad deeds, and this is my karma now You were just more serious at work Your attitude was a bit arrogant, and you shout at people unsparingly But it's nothing evil Karma should not get you No, Bo I really did commit evil deeds I let Maria down so badly... - Who's Maria? - She was my maid 3 months ago, Maria's boyfriend Mario met a Thai maid next door And he was caught in bed by Maria She was so angry that she hurt Mario with a knife She then asked me to lend her money so she could abscond to Philippines I said yes at once And I told her I'm going to the bank to withdraw some money that she should wait for me at home I would then send her to the airport You are a very loyal friend then But actually, I called the police once I left home, I told the police to arrest her Fat bitch, you will never be well, you and everyone around you will be lovelorn and heartbroken A week after Maria was caught, my boyfriend broke up with me Bo, don't you think this is karma? What about Maria? I could no longer find her Actually I want to apologize to her And I really want to know, what she meant when she shouted at me that day Anyway I'm glad you came to visit me today, at least you see me as a friend You're welcome Fanny, may I come visit you in two days' time? Come and chat with you I'm going to Paris tomorrow night Planning to finish my PHD there You will be disappointed if you come in two days That's why I believe, everything in this world is predestined Was the restaurant just now good? Superb -Let's go watch a movie -Sure But I'm not having an early night tonight Off yet? Where're you now? I'm in office having a meeting, talk to you later "Three days later" Sometimes I feel, acting is not that simple, you need to be culturally refined Apprentice Stop it, who's your apprentice? It's just a phrase Welcome for joining us Let's talk about money first, I want more More? What more? Are we the swindlers or are you? More? -I want 500 thousand -What? Wait The first time isn't always valuable, do you know that? How do we settle the two shots I took for you in Kuwait last time? I only took you 300 thousand This is impossible... Just her? 500 thousand? No, don't touch me Same tactic, again? They agreed So we are now partners, let me introduce Although you guys met last time But we still need to do an introduction as a formality Fat nine, Jac Say hello, why so rude? Who's she? You haven't introduced? I'm Bo, nice to meet you Can't you see how polite she is? Nice to meet you Let's not waste time Tell me quickly what I have to do So motivated Clients are arriving soon, get the preparation going Don't block my way Our heartfelt appreciation to Mr. Chan for his invitation to us to orchestrate a self-kidnap case The handsome Mr. Chan, I need not introduce him right? Everyone should recognise him from the tabloids, welcome Nice to meet you Mr. Chan, I recognise you You specialise in stealing other people's wives and going after young models You also have three testicles How do you feel with three testicles? Three testicles... Mr. Chan, please don't mind Back to the topic, as per your instructions Your blood-stained handkerchief is already in the hands of your wife If I didn't estimate wrongly Your wife should be waiting for the kidnappers, that is us, to call now Wait I haven't seen this girl before, who is she? Little girl. You look nervous, are you feeling well? - What little girl? - He is a man He used to be the Thai general's right-hand man Take off the glasses Hello Hello Transgenders are human too, let's not dig deep Time to make the call This phone is clean, it won't be hooked Hello, who are you? Mrs. Chan? You didn't call the police, did you? No, I didn't call the police If you dared to call the police, wait to pick up your husband's corpse No, please don't kill my husband It'll be fine if you follow our instructions We will give you 24 hours to get ready We are asking for a 30 million ransom One thousand dollar notes with no consecutive serial numbers We will let you know the location later Remember, if you call the police Your husband will be dead And he will suffer to death I need to talk to my husband Dear, save me... Darling, are you ok? Did they hurt you? Argh, don't hit me Stop, stop... Dear, please bring the money quickly and save me But how could we find 30 million dollars of cash? If your mother knows, she will definitely call the police Don't shoot, don't... Darling Mrs. Chan, if you call the police Your husband will become a honeycomb Please don't Dear, you can't let stepmum know I'm not her son, she had wanted me to die for long But how could we find 30 million dollars of cash? Our company received 30 million dollars of cash yesterday, it's in the safe This is embezzlement Dear, you have to save me I beg you Mrs. Chan, all we want is 30 million If you call the police, your husband will die Will she go get the money? She definitely will My wife loves me dearly She would willingly give up her life for mine Your wife must be blind You fat bastard, done talking yet? I dare you I would pay to have you killed By then you would have to ask us for help Mr. Chan, are we sticking to our plan? No change David Mrs. Chan? Are you okay? I'm fine What actually is the plan between you and Mr. Chan? Can you tell me? Mr. Chan's plan is to have his wife killed once the money is received Is he insane? His wife is embezzling to save him, why does he still have to take her life? Murder isn't part of my job Now that you know about us Do you think you can just walk away? You are now one of us, you can't back out Mr. Chan said he will top up the price If he's willing to top up even more, I'm willing to kill you guys even Stop talking Hand out the guns You're insane, I'm not doing it I won't kill Hold it We're giving you 500 thousand dollars and you don't do anything My bros won't let you off, right? Don't be scared, it's just for show I will handle everything, Don't worry Darling You alright? Have you brought the money? -It's here -Let's go Let's go, darling There's no one now, let's take the money and go Running away without putting down the money? Where's the money? I brought the money, it's all here Monk Sha, count it That's too much, it takes time to count Okay, count later Can we leave now? We've got the money, you wanna stay for supper? Shut up, Wukong Pigsy, send them out - Me? - Who else? Let's go Mrs. Chan? David? I know everything now This is a big deal, why didn't you discuss with me first? You're on my stepmother's side Why would you help me? Discuss? What do we need to discuss? This is the company's money, this is illegal and you'll be imprisoned for it I don't care, saving my husband is my priority David, please let us go No way, you've always wanted me to die You've been working for my stepmother What's the agenda? It's only for money You want money, because you're poor You're a slumdog, born a slumdog - Darling! - You can't escape, I've already called the police Bastard Darling, what are you doing? Someone is killed Bitch, what did you say? Calm down, leave from the back door We will handle the rest You are all rubbish I hired you all to kill people for me In the end I had to do it myself, money will be deducted Mr. Chan! Give me the gun Someone is killed You lied to me... we're doomed Calm down, everything's fine You lied to me I won't trust you anymore Calm down How can I calm down? Sir, ID please Okay Are you Mr. Chan? -What a coincidence -Yes Do you mind if we check your bags - What? - It's no big deal, just formality A lot of people like to film others surreptitiously these days If we just check your ID but not your bags We'll get complaints But there's nothing special in my bags All the more not to worry This is interesting, what's this? Isn't it the "zodiac" dog head statue in Jacky Chan's movie? It's a national treasure Are you smuggling national treasure? Smuggle what? It's definitely fake, it's a prop But how do you explain these two bags? Mr. Chan, are you selling drugs? Cheers We did a great job today I don't want to look Don't scream -Have a good look -I don't want to Have a good look It's done - Are you ok? - I'm alright Well done You were driving me crazy I nearly killed you Yes, seeing the blood ooze out was awesome - Really? - Acting wasn't the key The key was pressing the button at exactly the right timing I haven't finished yet, again Look, very accurate How cool is that? Once again Fantastic Good sound effects, no big deal It would all be a failure if not for my flawless machinery Louise, we owe it to you Were it not for you, I wouldn't have found a way to leave my husband Amy, you're welcome We've been mates since high school, of course I'll help you You should have left this bastard way earlier He is not only horny, he is also violent I finally had my revenge on him, I feel exuberant David, have we dealt with everything else? I have done as per your instructions I have deleted the CCTV footage capturing Amy removing money from the safe I've also put his blood-stained handkerchief into the safe, he will never be exculpated The money has been sorted -These are yours -Thanks Louis David, treat Amy well I wish you two will live happily ever after -I will -Let's have another drink Cheers What? Are you still scared How's my performance today? Definitely perfect But I didn't do anything Whether a scene is good or not does not only depend on the main protagonist Other actors are also very important Because you look innocent Mr. Chan decided to take your gun at the eleventh hour Because you look most harmless It gave him the illusion that his goal could be easily achieved And this led him to make the decision to kill I don't mind telling you Among us, you were the only one who could do it You are really just trying to say that I look dumb enough after all this, aren't you? If every swindler looked as handsome as Louis Koo we would be jobless 500 thousand is yours Why do you need so much money? Why do we have so much food tonight? To celebrate my resignation Why the sudden resignation? I went to see the doctor today You saw the doctor? Why? Are you not feeling well? I'm pregnant Pregnant? When will we get married? You know that I recently had a change of jobs... I will take care of the finances All you need to do is say yes Elaine, please take a seat Just let me know if you need me -Mum -Okay, thank you Have some tea, what do you want to eat? Oh how good a mood you are in today to ask me out for tea today? You want to ask me for something? Be crisp, just say it I want to borrow money How much? 500 thousand So much money? Why do you need it? Wedding With who? Of course it's Sun, who else? And I was thinking I would be pleasantly surprised Has Sun got no balls? Want a wedding but can't pay the bill? He wants to borrow money but doesn't even bother to appear? He had to put his girlfriend out there to do it? This has nothing to do with Sun Getting married is my decision too Are you an idiot? Did Sun use a tame head on you? Or are you being deluded by demons? I just don't understand why you can't manage to leave this guy I'm already used to being scolded by you If you are willing to lend me money You can punish me however you wish I won't lend you Mum, I've never begged you for anything since young Just help me once Just once okay? Did I not make myself clear enough just now? I won't lend you money to marry this bastard I'm pregnant Do you think you can threaten me with this? I said it, and I won't Fine, from now on I'll never beg you for anything The wedding will go ahead no matter what If you are free, come, if not, forget it Just think to yourself you never had me as a daughter What did you say? Never had you as a daughter? How are you a daughter when you behave like this What I tell you to do, you fail What I tell you not to, you do I'm your mother, how could you talk to me like this? I'm gonna hit you to death, imma hit you... I never had you as a daughter Let's confirm. Next Friday, 9 pm See you there, at the shop as last time I have committed so much for this 500 thousand dollars You thought I'm just saying? Don't you remember I told you, I knew he's a bad guy the first time I laid my eyes on him? I'm serious If you see me as a friend, I don't want to hear this anymore You saw how Mr. Chan treated his wife just now When a man doesn't love you anymore, he could do anything against you Not my boyfriend You sure? Sweetie, what's wrong? Without Mary's "Lucky Macchiato", I'm suffering misfortune every day How could this be? It's just all in your head I don't want to talk to you Laura Didn't I ask you not to find me anymore? But I miss you so much I'm in a hurry, I need to go to work Laura. Please don't leave, listen to me first I really need to work, next time Look who's with me? -Hello -Master Mak Ling Ling? Mak Ling Ling did a divination for us We can get married, we'll even enjoy a long life together Doctor Kwan gave me the Four Pillars of your birthday Originally, this year is a year of conflict hence not suitable for marriage But this year, your date of birth aligns with the sky and the earth As they say, one good strikes three bad, no good comes mishap Therefore this year is most suitable to conceive, if good can come in a pair that would bring the best luck of all Did you hear what the Master said? We can get married this year Why don't you understand? The crux of the problem isn't about getting married or not When we fought last time, I felt God was sending me a message That we should take a break and think clearly whether we should be together Always on and on about presentiment What if your presentiment is wrong? Even if it were wrong, I would still choose to believe it If you're so rational even in a relationship Life would be so difficult, what's the point? Maybe this is the difference between you and me Laura, fine, you win Win what? You are angry at me for that incident right? Which incident? Last Christmas, you went abroad I went to Lan Kwai Fong, and bumped into your girl friend Niki We drank, and slept together for one night Didn't you say you really hate her? You said she is a bitch, why did you two... Laura I know you are angry at me you want to revenge and punish me Laura, don't be so upset Sorry I'll never do it again Excuse me I'm crying tears of joy Laura, are you ok? Don't scare me Bingo, awesome Are you ok? Vincent, thank you so much You single-handedly screwed up our relationship I really didn't know about it, but you said it out of guilt Thank you Vincent You proved that we can't be together Thank you for setting me free Good boy It will be a new start from today Don't find me if you don't have to, bye Master, didn't you say we can get back together? You cheated on her first, you can't blame anyone I have to work now, call me if you need me Think carefully, which team? Back so early? Is this early? I have been out for a whole day I went to the designer to check out some invitation cards I have taken some pictures, I will show you later Take a rest in the room first if you are tired I'm still gonna chat with Teddy for a while, let's go out for dinner in a bit ok? Ok, why are you two acting furtive? Something happened? Nothing much, go take a rest Sun, if you don't settle the amount Your deposit will be forfeited to the supplier That batch of stock is highly sought-after in the market Wouldn't that be burning your fingers? Of course I know that, but I really don't have the cash Wait, what about that Mainland woman? She's quite rich, borrow from her I told you, don't mention that woman anymore Bo doesn't know about it What are you gonna do then? We could have made a fortune I know, but maybe the fortune wasn't meant for you anyway If I had the money I would reserve it for my wedding As for weddings, it doesn't have to be fancy Why don't you discuss it with Bo, use the money for business instead Don't even think about this Bo's lifelong dream is to get married This is her wish, I can't disappoint her But you need to think it through, the deposit was borrowed from loan sharks You will get into trouble if you can't settle it I know, I will think of a way No matter what, I won't take a penny from Bo Why don't you go to sleep? Thinking about your past again? I started this work at the age of 17, then I launched my first album half a year later I won all the newcomer awards at the age of 18 I also won the gold record All my fans were screaming and chasing me everywhere, I felt awesome at that time The fans even held a birthday party for me that year Do you know how many cakes I ate? 37 pieces. A total of 37 I didn't reject. Why? I love them all After that I went to the hospital and stayed for 3 days I swore afterwards I will not eat birthday cake anymore From then on, I couldn't be popular anymore, I was forced to change my career Now I'm 38 years old I have nothing I work every day, facing at those colleagues who work like the deads This is ridiculous You don't have to think too much You will feel better tomorrow when you wake up It's not that easy You forgot you still have a good wife like me? I will transfer 500 thousand to your bank account tomorrow - What? - Why? Is that not enough? I just have that much left I saved all these money for our wedding I will borrow money from the finance company for our wedding The interest rate from finance companies are too high When you have the money after selling the stocks, will you help me on my debts? How did you know? Don't tell me you are going to abandon me when you are rich Of course not I'll do everything for you Do you know, you are the best to me in this world I love you, baby I love you so much Why is your home getting smaller? It's just the same, you haven't come for a long time you didn't invite me You won't come even if I invited you What did you say? Nothing What's your plan for the wedding? It's good, it will be on the day after The day after? You didn't even tell me? I'm now telling you My wedding day is on the day after, do come if you are free Come and have a seat if you have time Are you going to talk to me like this forever? Likewise You are just like me I was exactly the same when I was young I treated your grandmother with the same attitude But your grandmother was way much fearful than me She would smash my face before I finished my sentence If I argue, she would hit me more Why didn't I hear you say any of these before These things are not easy to say out Your grandmother has 10 kids, yet she loves the boys more When I was 14 years old, she planned to sell me to the grocery store boss as his second wife That guy was fat and bold, it scared me out I was so scared and so I ran away from home Then I started selling chewing gums at a dance hall in Wan Chai The manager of the Band thought my voice was good He suggested me to start learn singing Then I sang for more than 30 years I had a bit of fame afterwards, but your grandmother thought being a singer had no future Then she got sick But none of her sons came to visit her I'm the only one who made soup for her everyday But that didn't change anything The day when she was going to die I rushed to see her for the last time at the hospital after work I still remember, when she nearly stopped breathing I have never called her for that many times in my whole life Mum... mum... Mum... mum... Mum... mum... No matter how many times I shouted her name, she wouldn't hear a word anymore You blamed me for not taking good care of you when you were young That's true and I feel sorry to you But I had given the best to both of you and your sister I am not shame about myself, do you understand? I don't understand why I feel more frustrating when I see you Maybe you look the same as me You kept all the problems to yourself You are so stubborn and in the end you suffer When Mum says you're wrong It is because I don't want to see you becoming me, do you understand? Sorry, mum You shouldn't say sorry to me You should feel sorry for yourself Got it? you are still young You still have many years to live, you have to live your life great Mum, sorry Mum, you don't have to worry about me I'm mature enough, I can take care of myself Mum is old now, I couldn't take care of you for much longer You look Do you like it? Mum gives it to you Why are you crying? Mum, this is your treasure why are you giving it to me? Of course, Elaine's daughter is getting married How can you not present yourself with a better piece of jewelry in front of people Don't cry... It is so pretty Silly girl Thanks mum Don't cry... I want to ask you something What? You aren't pregnant actually, right? How do you know? I'm also a woman We are so stupid, we always think about ways to keep the men we love The question is, does this man worth to sacrifice for? No matter what, mum is always here for you Just remember, no matter how sad you are You still have your family to back you up, got it? Sun, you look really handsome today I can't blame you guys less, can't I? Are you trying to say that I wasn't handsome before? "Swindler" Be quick, open the door Open the door, be quick Stop playing Keep quiet, I'm thinking I live here, I have keys Can I open the door myself? Open the door Sun, you're so smart today I'm smart everyday Yes Open the door Bo, are you ready? Quickly go get change, the flight won't wait for us I'm almost done, just let me send one more message "Liar" "Bastard" I was played by you for the past 7 years, it's my turn now to fool you once, you would not get mad right? Let me tell you a secret, I am not pregnant actually A person like you will never have kids? The most important thing is, don't even think about the 500 thousand You solve it with the finance company by yourself Mission accomplished When a man doesn't love you anymore, he will do anything to hurt you My boyfriend won't do this to me You sure? Okay, I show you something Did you know she is together with Sun? Do you want to know more? This girl is my partner, she is trying to fool your boyfriend There's a gentleman recently He always thinks he is very handsome -but he is actually a fool -Any pictures? Look, am I right? He's really stupid I'm persuading him to buy me a Korean brand hair reborn shampoo Those are outdated for a very long time It's selling 28 dollars per bottle in Sum Shui Po How do you know? He is the only one who believes That's why I said he's stupid Honestly when I saw your boyfriend, I knew I know he isn't a good guy, Your boyfriend has asked the finance company for the deposit He is the victim Let's bet, if your boyfriend knows you have 500 thousand He will try his best to get your 500 thousand in a week's time He will not If I win, you have to call me Master What if you lose? I will give you extra 500 thousand Deal Okay, I will think of a solution Whatever, I won't use a penny from Bo Good one No matter what, he is your brother It doesn't sound good for you to help me like this How can you be soft to a person like him? It's good to give him a punish for once Didn't know you have such loyalty to friends Of course But you aren't so bad for paying the trip includes meals for me How can I treat you badly? Since we are not getting married, yet with all these money it's better to spend them on travelling Can't imagine we are both singles together This is so serious, why didn't your brother call me? According to his temper, he will surely ask me to find you Where's my phone? Must have left it at home, I'm always so careless I will go back to get it now, wait for me Be quick and be careful What's the matter again? Look opposite to you Why are you keep following me? In another words, I think we are destined to be together I'm not a swindler like you guys, I can't see things like you do You're also a swindler. Apprentice I'm just an amateur Let's talk about this, it's time for redemption -Call me master -Here? Of course, it feels good to shout loudly on the streets You are crazy, there are so many people on the street This is so embarrassing -Say it -No Come on, say it No, it's too crazy - Go! - I won't go until you say it Go...
