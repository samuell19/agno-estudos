Guys, did you see what Ronaldo did to PSG? Heard he scored 2 goals. We didn't even get to see Neymar. I bet... Real Madrid wins the Champions League this year. No way! Messi and Barca will wipe the floor with them after they beat Chelsea. How will we watch it while we're here? Don't worry. We'll be back home just in time for it. Ali, who do you think will take the cup? "The possession of anything begins in the mind." What does that mean? It means Bruce Lee was wise. And, that I don't care about who wins a football game. Falasi... Ease up a little. I spent a lot of time making this stuff. Don't be sensitive about it. It's a jerry can. Easy to replace. If you're not the one replacing it. If you want to use the equipment, treat it right. I told her we had wounded, three days worth of reports... and a vehicle to clean out. You know what she said? "You could have called.” Is marriage always like this? You're a soldier. You should be good at reporting to your superior by now. Too bad you're on Quick Response Force duty tomorrow. You're gonna miss out… - On what? - Leg day. Maybe I could switch with Al-Falasi? Might be my last chance to drive on patrol with you guys. What do you say, Falasi? You sure? I don't know if you're ready for all of Ali's endless rules. What are you doing? Falasi, respect yourself and the training. Forget my rules. You could be the best of us if you really tried. Better than me. Who said I want to be anything like you? I'm trying to help you. - I never asked for your help. - What's your problem? Guys! Calm down... Attention! Morning, Sir! - Morning. - Everything okay there? Training, Sir. Building teamwork! - I'm sick of this. - Drop it. I'll talk to him. Bilal, you always talk to him. He never listens. Forget about it. It's just one more week before we go home. My daughter wants a magical horse for her birthday. But this one is pretty ordinary. I'll have to decorate it. Don't you think? I warned him. Take advice from your brother. Not everything has to be done your way. You have to give and take with others. Let's go. Ali! All done. Thank you. Falasi, forgive me brother. Easy to replace. They switched? I heard you already distributed 3,000 boxes this week. What can I do? I get hungry on patrol. You're a bottomless pit. What brings you here? Switching things up, Falasi? Last week. Why not? How do you smoke that poison? My lungs or yours? You deserve that. I guess we're playing football today. Let's roll. Ready for the ride? When do you leave for your promotion exam, Sir? - Next week. - Are you ready? I'm ready to see my family. Sir, with you gone... I'd hate to work for someone else as stubborn as you. Would you consider recommending me to take over your command? Are you okay not being out there on the front? My family will love it. Will you? I already wrote the recommendation. When you're ready. I'm not wrong about Falasi. He's like your older brother, you can't speak to him like that. I know, I do consider him like a brother. But you want me to see his mistakes and stay quiet? What I'm worried about is that his actions affect everyone else. If he's not at his best, our team's not at its best. Ali... Enough. We're on patrol. Hey! What's so important? Al... She's been sick. - Why didn't you say anything? - We don't know what's wrong yet. Hey. Something up ahead. Yemeni forces. Do we know these guys? I think I've seen them before. - Peace be upon you brother. - And unto you peace. May God give you health. - How are you? - All good. - What's wrong? - Car broke down, needs some fixing. How's the horse coming? It's just fine. But, I want to give her something special. You think we can trust these guys? Can't tell. Stay with them. Get them back on the road and then catch up. What are we doing? Yemeni Forces reported activity in the foothills ahead. Gave us a location. - Are we checking it out? - It's right by the shepherd's place. Just off our patrol route. Let's see what they have to say. - Oh no... - What? Looks like we found the activity. Ali! I fixed it. Show me. Peace be upon you. Welcome. I wish we had more, but the Enemy has been blocking the aid. But don't worry, we're working on getting more. What about my goats? Some were taken. Are you sure they were taken? They're probably wandering around... They'll come back. I'm sure they were taken because I heard gunshots. - Gunshots? - Yes! - Last night. - From where? Goodbye! Ali! This is the location the Yemenis told us about. The canyon should lead us to a clearance. 0-1 to 0-2, what's your status? Over. Got the Yemeni truck back on the road. We're on the move. Copy. We're entering the canyon now, heading for the location. Copy that. Just a few minutes behind you. Over and out. The football was a nice touch. Might as well let the kids play, before all they know are guns. Any news from home? No signal. Don't worry, Ali. She'll be fine. How would you know that? I'm her husband and I don't know. What would happen to my kids if she dies? Or if that shepherd gets killed, what happens to his kids? They get kidnapped, trained to kill or become human shields. And we're here to prevent that from happening. That's what we should be focusing on. Sir! Eleven o'clock! Ali, aim the gun at him. We need to move! 0-1 to 0-2, we have enemy contact! I repeat, we have contact! Do you copy? Copy. We're inbound. We're stuck. 0-1 to 0-2. We're unable to move. Taking heavy enemy fire. Small arms and RPG. We need back up. Copy? Copy that. Coming as fast as possible. 7 o'clock! - Light it up. - Where's Salem? Enemy 10 o'clock! Machine gun is dead. 0-2, are you in range? Go back! We took an RPG. Our front... s... royed. - Why aren't we moving? - I'm trying! We're out! Get out of here quick. Come in. Sir. They need you. What's the situation, Sir? Patrol is engaged with the enemy. Details are still coming in. We have open comms with Patrol 2. Both vehicles are under heavy fire. Patrol 1 is inoperable and trapped in a canyon. - Comms with the lead vehicle? - No, Sir. And, Patrol 2 is damaged and can not reach them. I gave Sgt. Salem the order to hold until you can reach his vehicle. Prepare the Quick Response Force with the men you need. On it, Sir. Let's go Sa'eed. - Listen up! - Yes, Sir. Gear up for QRF. - Yes, Sir. Who are we picking up? - Patrol. - Bilal? - We leave in five. Ready now, Sir! I don't want to see the inside of that thing for at least 24 hours. - Sayari, Balooshi! - Yes, Sir! - Get ready. We have a mission. - Sir? Patrol got hit. May be wounded. Report to Captain Sa'eed. Yes, Sir. Do you need to call your wife for permission? Get moving. Come on. Let's roll. You guys okay? - Did we hit something? - I don't know. The controls aren't working. Can you get us out of here? I've tried every gear, every switch. Got nothing. 0-1 to 0-2, do you read? Come on! Salem, we're in some serious trouble here. Is someone coming to get us? They're everywhere. They probably got our message and turned back. If they did, they'll call in Quick Response. What the hell is this alarm? It warns us there's a problem. No, really? How long would a Quick Response Force take to get here? At least an hour. An hour. Then we just need to stay alive for an hour. What do you have left? Four cartridges. Thirty bullets each. You? Same. What? No way we'll have service out here. - Nothing. - I might have... Nothing. 0-9 to 0-2. QRF is ten minutes out. Copy that. What is your situation? We were shot by an RPG. Vehicle still operational but not for long. We are under heavy fire. We're giving as much cover fire as we've got, but I don't know how long we can hold that position. - Any visual on Patrol 1? - No, Sir. Reassign a UAV to their location. I need to see what we're dealing with here. Sending coordinates now. Control to 0-9, UAV being re-routed to your location. We've got enemy moving everywhere. Pull Back. We need the canyon clear for the QRF to reach Patrol 1. Copy that, Sir. There's movement. RPG advance. They're going to shoot an RPG at us again. Record this. Record the vehicle. Keep it going. Are you guys alright? I don't know how long the vehicle is going to hold. Aim at the door. - Bilal... - Hindasi! - What happened? - Are you okay? Hindasi? Ali, give me a hand. Come on. Put pressure on it. We have to stop the bleeding. Put your hand there. We're getting close to the location. This is a good place to stop. Stop here. Get moving. Faster! Faster! Hurry! Their back up will arrive soon. What's going on? Get them out of that vehicle and get the wounded to medical. They're out of the vehicles. Hurry up. Faster. Fire! Get your men to safety! Move back! Move back! It's coming from the mountain. Their range is limited. Keep moving or they can pinpoint you. It's not the first volley you have to worry about... It's the second. Where's the UAV? I need eyes on enemy mortar positions. What's your location? I had to reroute it to avoid dust winds. UAV inbound. Twenty K out. Under three minutes away, Sir. Copy that. Stop. Out of range. You have to save our men by any means necessary. We cannot allow any hostage to be taken by the enemy. You have full authority to extract them. It's a matter of national security. Copy that, Sir. To all stations. This is the situation. We have one vehicle trapped in that canyon under heavy fire. Our men are surrounded. The Enemy is in control and know the terrain well. There may be hundreds of them hiding in there. This was no ordinary attack. They planned it. This is an ambush. They are prepared for us and are willing to do whatever it takes. We must respect our Enemy's capability. We must not underestimate them. Our strength is not our various weapons. Our strength is each other. We are the only hope for these men. We will bring our brothers home. Guys... I've got service. Come on! - Hello? - Shamsi! Bilal! Did they rescue you? No. Is anyone coming for us? QRF is on its way. Make sure they come quickly. We're okay but Hindasi is hurt. I will. Give me the phone. Mum? No, I'm fine... I'm fine. Bring us forward. Let's see what they have. UAV in position, Sir. Take care of yourselves. Guys, you should call your families. I'll call when we get back to base. - Ali. - When we get back to base. They're not shooting at us anymore. Turn it around. Strange, why didn't they use mortars until we got here? The trapped patrol vehicle is bait. Bait? For what? Us. To draw us in to them. What do we do? Bite the hook. 400 meters in. Contact left! Mark it. Mortar rounds 500 meters in. Coordinates North 1320, 999. East 43, 100 Copy. Hold. Those other rounds were 80's... That's a 120. The vehicle won't withstand their blasts. Pull back slowly. Coordinates of second mortar position... Mazroui, you're getting popular down there. See. Always a second one. A third position on the cliff. 9 o'clock. Sir, back to 80s. We've got them. Pull back. We're back to first mortar position. Sir... We're out of range again. What's the sit rep from the UAV? Located three mortar positions. Locking their coordinates. 0-9 to Command, get me air support to neutralize the mortar positions. Get him air support. Relay the mortar coordinates. Copy Sir, scrambling an Apache now from Al Anad. I have an idea. Let's do it. How do we get out of here? The horse. I'll paint it pink. She'll love it. You come with me. RPG reload. Get them out. Bilal! Are you okay? I'm okay. Come out Emiratis. If you surrender now we won't kill you. Go around the other side. This is your last chance. We will not surrender! Ali, are you okay? Lucky! Guys... You, record this. You come here. Make sure you get this. I'll make an example out of them. Get out Emiratis! What did he do? You should have the feed now, Sir. Sir. I think they're trying to get them out of the vehicle. 0-9 to Command. How far out is my chopper? Twenty two minutes. Sir, this might be over in ten. We need air support there before they step out of the vehicle. Sir, we don't have time to take the mortars out first. You heard? I know the Soldiers that were ambushed. I spent a few months with them at an F.O.B. near Mocha. I know the names of their kids. Permission to go in first, Sir. Prepare your men. Give me your phone. - Hello? - My love, it's me. Ali? I didn't recognize the number. Are you back from patrol? - What did the doctor say? - She ran some tests and... I'm pregnant. I'm so happy. Are the kids with you? No. They're with your mom. We can call you tonight. I can't wait. Ali? I'm so happy you're okay. I have to go. Kiss the kids for me. I love you. She's okay. Bilal... Promise me. If things go wrong out there, take care of my children. - Ali... - Promise me! You have my word. But, you've got to promise me the same. 1-1 to 1-2, stay on my six. Copy that. More vehicles are coming. You, wait there! Take them when they come out! You come with me. They're pulling back. We have to get out. We'll suffocate if we stay in here. This might be our last chance. Ready? Ali, wait! I have to tell you something... The horse is special because you made it. It doesn't need much decorating. Don't worry about it, brother. I appreciate it. Now! Ali! Go Bilal! Go! I'll be okay! Go help Hindasi! Help Hindasi! Help Hindasi! 1-1 to 1-2, get ready. Over. We're not safe here. We have to get moving. There's cover over there. If we reach it we might have a chance. Are you kidding? I can't run! Neither can I. Then you'll crawl. I'll draw their fire. Move when they focus on me. - Ali! - You can barely move! I'll get there and give you cover. Keep going, I'll keep them off you. We have one down. We've got to get to them. Now. 1-1 to 1-2 We have confirmation of wounded soldiers. Over. Bilal! Did Ali make it? Ali... Ali's okay. Ali's okay. He's taking cover. We won't make it where he is. There's too much fire. Comms not working... Too much interference here! 1-2... They've come for us. We're going to get out of this. 1-1 to 1-2 Pull around us, do you copy? Signal them to move up. We're moving up. Get ready! Pull back! Pull back! 0-9 to 1-2, do you copy?! Copy! Is everyone okay? My left hand is numb. I have to tie this down before you have four fingers. 0-9 to 1-1. What's your stat? The medics were hit by a landmine. My vehicle is damaged, Sir. It got stuck backing up. What about the medics? Not moving either. Sayari. Sayari, are you okay? We have to get them out of there. Look at me. We have to get them to safety. Your head. Are you okay? Do you know where you are? In a flipped over vehicle with you. How many fingers am I holding up? Get your hand out of my face. You reek of tobacco. You're fine. Enemy advancing! Get that gun firing again. The gun is out of ammo. Thirty seconds. Reloaded. Keep the enemy back. We're going to die out here, aren't we? No. Stay still. Just stay still. Don't move. Don't let anyone see us. You hear me? Don't worry. Hang in there. We're going to be fine. - Patch me through. - Yes, Sir. You are now connected to Hunter 1-8, Sir. 0-9 to Hunter 1-8. Destroy the mortar positions. Copy that, Sir. Incoming! Incoming! Mortar position one neutralized. Mortar position two neutralized. I'm sending another rescue team now before the enemy has a chance to regroup. The enemy's focused on the Apache. We should try and extract the wounded. Let's move! Let me help! Anti-air fire from the valley. Look! - He's hit! - Captain Sa'eed. The turret! We can get out through there. Zayoodi, aim for the sniper! Screw them! It doesn't seem we're getting out of here. More gound to air fire. This one was close. Be very careful, the last thing we need is having you shot down. Yes, Sir. Are you okay? Yes. Get me up. Going again for the third mortar. Taking heavy fire, Sir. Hunter 1-8, forget mortar position three. Fall back. I repeat... fall back. I know you're not afraid, but we can't have the Apache go down. Give me cover! Give me your hand. Take cover! I couldn't get them. Sir, your shoulder - It's fine. 1-1 to 0-9 They're hiding under those rocks. The chopper thinned them out but they have numbers. I tried to reach the wounded but - Just hold tight. Rescue team is on the way. Sir, look at this. QRF 2, Enemy is placing mines on your route. Do not advance. Do you copy? QRF 2. Do you copy? QRF 2 pull back. QRF 2. Do you copy? Do you copy? QRF 2. Do you copy? There's something going on over there. We're getting out of here. Put a bomber squadron on alert. Yes, Sir. Rescue Team two? Report. What's your status? Rescue Team to 0-9, we're okay. Under heavy fire... Mazroui, you have to get us out of here. They're everywhere! There's nothing we can do. Mohamed... They're going to kill us. You can't call him by his first name! Send in another vehicle! A land cruiser. Anything. Please answer us. Stay strong, we fear nothing. I promise I'm going to get you all home. 0-9 to Command. I hear you. Over. Requesting reconnaissance of the entire field, Sir. Copy. Reframe on the Ambush site. They're going to send more. We wait for them. Keep filming! There's cover all the way in now... If we can get another troop carrier into the canyon... we can use the damaged vehicles as cover... it'll make a solid wall. Just one vehicle squeezed between these two... To all stations. Get yourselves ready and wait for my signal. 0-9, what's your plan here? I'm going in with everything I have left, Sir. Mazroui, you're taking a great risk. Sir. I won't send more men in there if I'm not willing to go in myself. Your command vehicle will be spotted right away. You'll be a clear target. I understand Sir, but I have to get them out NOW. Give me your medwakh. You don't smoke. Didn't you say it's poisonous? Stay positive. At least the air conditioning is still working. 0-9 to Rescue Team two. Clear your vehicles and take cover. Can you see anything? I think they're finally coming to us. Move! Move! Yes! Come on Mazroui! See, I told you! Pull us over. 0-9 to 2-3, load those soldiers and get them to safety. Here they come! Here they come! Secure your positions. Help me get this open. Al-Zayoodi... I see them. Keep them busy. - Give them a hand. - Open that door! Go! Run inside! Move! Move! Take cover behind this vehicle! I'm out, Sir... Falasi We have to get you out. You've lost a lot of blood. Staying with you, Sir. That's my team. I'm not leaving without my brothers. Push harder Balooshi. Get down! Crawl under the vehicle! Make room! Move! Move! And be careful! 3-3 to 0-9, men evacuated. 3-1, move forward. Destroy that machine gun and get them all out. 0-9 to all, report in sequence. From 3-3. Engine functional. But our gun is down. Request permission to fall back. Copy. Take them back. 3-1 copy? Any wounded? Negative sir, but vehicle inoperable. Copy 3-1. Hang tight and we'll get to you. 1-1, copy? Same situation. 3-4, copy? Here, Sir. Fully functioning. Keep the enemy's heads down. We made it. But our men are still out there. Ali's not moving... I don't think we're getting out. I have a plan... Listen, you guys wait for the signal. Bring back the wounded. I'm gonna go take care of that sniper. What's the signal? You'll know. Smoke. Now! Yes, Sir! Keep them back. Keep them back. That's the signal. Go! 0-9, I've ordered an air strike. F-16s will be on site in seven minutes. Once you get our boys clear, call it in. Copy that, Sir. Turn around and head back. Keep firing, cover our men! Get moving! Keep going! Go, go! Go, go! Move! Move! Be ready to retrieve our men. Ali! Bilal! Hindasi! Over here! Bilal, we're getting you out of here. You're going to be okay. Ali... We have to get Ali. We will. I promise. But first we have to get you out of here. We have the survivors. Forgive me, brother. Turn around! Unlike you, I don't shoot people in the back. Drop everything we have on those mountains. Copy that, Sir. Should we open fire, Sir? No. Leave it to the Falcons. Sir... We wouldn't have made it out of here if it weren't for you. No, the Children of Zayed did it. Let's say the prayer. In the name of Allah almighty... Praise be to the lord of the universe. The most gracious, the most merciful. Master of the Day of Resurrection. You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek guidance. Guide us to the straight path. The path of those on whom you have bestowed your grace. Not those who have gone astray. Amen. Come quickly!
