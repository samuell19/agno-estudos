Gabriella, when did you become one of these depressed, gothic types? [laughs] Um, I'm not goth, Aunt Belinda, and I'm not depressed. At least I wasn't, until now. So, what do you think of our new house? We got a great deal, thanks to your Uncle Bill. I call first dibs on the bedrooms! [Mother sighs] [Belinda] Well, they seem to be doing all right. They're resilient, like their father. When are the movers getting here? Ohh. A few hours. Great. Marsh, sweetie, um, you're not... Belinda! Of course not. I just feel like celebrating, you know? Being so close to my little sister again. Okay. I'm sorry. I-I just... Anyway, here. It's fine. I'm fine. Good. [sighs] [sighs] I don't think I'm gonna like it here. This school isn't cheap. I mean, the only reason your father was willing to pay for it was because it has-- Has the best science engineering program South Carolina has to offer. I know. You do want to get into a good premed program don't you? Well, I guess. But look. Do you see anyone out there who looks like me at all? The daughter I knew used to celebrate being unique. That's because we used to live in a place where being unique was celebrated. I'm willing to bet that somewhere in this sea of students, you're gonna find some really cool kids. And if I don't? Then you can quit school and join me in the fun employment line. I think I'll take my chances in there. See ya. [English accent] Your file says you used to attend another performing arts school. Up near Los Angeles. But I used to study dance. Oh, dance? You don't strike me as the type. How long has it been? Not that long. Oh, too bad you quit, really, because we have an outstanding dance program here at Kensington. Well, then, it probably is for the best, really, 'cause not everyone's built for it, you know? The competition here is unbeatable, really. So, this is your locker. Your combination should be on your schedule. Don't lose it. First period starts in less than five minutes, so don't be late. [mock English accent] You don't strike me as the type. [scoffs] Talking to herself on the first day of a new school? Weird girl. Not to mention a unique, flavorful sense of fashion. If I didn't know any better, I'd say weird new girl's just begging to be teased. Begging. I didn't realize anyone was watching me. There's always someone watching. Lucky for you, it was just us. It just so happens we like weirdoes. Jude Katz. And I'm Danna. What's your name? I'm Gabby. Well, Gabby, where you "fonna" be at in P-1? She means your first period. Oh. That's what I said.

Oh, you know, hang, see movies, go to concerts. It always seemed like there was something to do. What about you guys? Uh-uh. Are you kidding me? We do nothing. Jude! I'd sell my skin to live in the city of Lashelle Angeles. [Danna] That's not true. We do stuff here. Hey, Judy. Unless you call our "P.A. geeking" stuff. I do, actually. Hey, I used to be a huge P.A. geek. There's nothing wrong with that. What do you two do anyway? Well, Jude here belongs to the music program, and she is wicked good. Think Missy Higgins meets Adele. Those two are amazing. I'd love to hear you play sometime. Oh, well, thanks, but I'm no Danna over here. She's the next Miss So You Think You Can Dance. Wait. Danni, you dance?

Strawberry scoop of poop on the right-- Mallory Madison. And that beastly blonde vanilla bean front and center who almost knocked you down-- one Miss Valerie Harper. Wait. Valerie Harper as in Principal Harper? As in little princess to the wicked "wee-atch" who rules this land. And you certainly wouldn't be the first person Val's ever barreled over to get her way. Yeah, she almost knocked me over on her way into the studio. Is she a dancer too? She and Fallon both are. I've been swimming in a sea of hardwood with those two sharks since I was seven. What about the redhead? Mallory's in the theater program. She's an aspiring thespian. Or, how she'll eventually be known-- girl who serves pancakes at the local diner. [laughter] Mm-hmm. Yeah. She does somethin' real strange for some change. God! Or Grandpa's money. Same thing. [laughs] Wait. So you dance. That's what brought you here, obviously. Maybe we'll have some classes together. Oh, no, I don't really dance anymore. So, then, what made you come here? Oh, I came here for the sciences program. My mom is dead set on me going to UCLA premed next fall. I actually didn't know you had such a great dance department until Harper mentioned it earlier. Seriously? 'Cause we have, like, one of the top dance programs in the state. So maybe it was fate and not science that brought you here, Miss Colussi. Check it out. It's our annual 1 Chance 2 Dance spring competition. Winning duo receives a $5,000 scholarship and gets seen by a panel of top academy recruiters. You interested? No. I'll come see you, though. Oh, come on, Gabby. Please! If not for the scholarship or the recruiters, then just for fun. I just-- I can't, Danna. Dance was something my dad and I shared, and now it's just-- just not the same. So you only danced because your dad wanted you to? No, I mean, I love to dance, more than anything. So what's the problem? I just can't. It's not realistic. I mean, even if I wanted to, my mom would never let me. Okay. So first you dance because your dad wanted you to, and now you're gonna become a doctor because your mom wants you to? Gabby, hello! You're almost 18. It's time for you to decide. What does Gabby want? So his name is Shawn. Ooh! Who's that, your new boyfriend? Max, I'm gonna kill you. - Ughh! - Ha! What are you gonna do now? Just go back to Shawn stalking. It'll take you at least a lifetime before you even get close to talking to him. Mom! I think we need to call the exterminator.

Well, thank you very much. We will make our decisions, and we'll let you know. Thank you. Mostly what you'll be doing is just making sure the patients are comfortable. Since many on this wing are on heavy pain relievers anyway, they won't wanna chitchat. Still, you'll find there are a few you can barely keep quiet. And if by some miracle, you can get her to eat, I'll be sure Dr. Tannenbaum writes you a really good reference letter come springtime. [game beeping] Whatcha playin'? Oh, just some silly game my son downloaded for me. He's always buying new games and downloading a bunch of music to this thing. Have you played the one where you can make the spider jump around? I love that one. I like that one too. But you know what my son and I really like to play is Robot Unicorn Attack. I love Robot Unicorn. I'm Gabby. It's nice to meet you. I'm Ginger. You look a lot younger than the other nurses. I'm not a nurse. I'm barely 18. I'm just volunteering here a couple afternoons during the week. And they've already left you with the impervious task of trying to get me to eat? You must be brave. Yes. No. No, that food makes me nauseous. Maybe if they'd serve up some chicken quesadillas, I'd be willing to negotiate. Well, what if I told you I'd struck a deal, and the only way I'm gonna get into a good school is if you ate some of that for me? You drive a hard bargain, young lady, but I like your chutzpah.

[chattering] I'll see you guys later. You ready? Yeah. Let's go. [faint chatter] [Girls squealing] I'm so excited! [high-pitched voice] Oh, my God! I'm so happy! Mm-mm. Ugly is not cute on you. This is awesome! I'm so excited. It's gonna be-- Oh... You're Gabby, right? Um, y-yeah. Mmm, mm, mm. I'm Shawn. I know. I mean, I heard at tryouts the other day. You were really good. Thanks. So were you. Really? Thanks. Yeah. In fact, the girl I used to partner with-- she graduated last year, actually, and off to Miami City Ballet she flew. So I was wondering if maybe you'd wanna partner with me on this? Yes! I mean, uh, sure. Why not? Okay. Great. Um, I kind of already choreographed this stellar jazz piece. I think you'd be perfect for it. I hope that's all right. Absolutely. It sounds amazing. Sweet. I look forward to it. You'll just need to talk to a counselor. Have them rearrange your schedule so we can work out our routine with Alex and Cynthia in eighth period. Oh, um, eighth period? But that's my anatomy class. Anatomy? Do you wanna study the body or move the body? [both chuckle] You're right. I'll see what I can do. I hope so. It is a requirement. I'll see ya. Bye. So, you must be Gabby, the new girl. I'm Val. This is Mal and Fal. [together] Hi. Hi. So we hear you're from Los Angeles. Wow. News travels fast around here. Like lightning. Ooh! I love those boots. Thanks. Odd choice of footwear for a dancer, though. Don't dancers usually like to show off their stems? I don't know about her, but I do. So these boots must be, like, a Los Angeles thing. No way. My granddaddy lives in the hills, and I go out there for auditions all the time, and L.A. is totally high fashion. But then again, you aren't really from L.A., are you, Gabriella? Well, I mean, I guess not. Technically, I'm from Encino, but-- Well, wait. So you're just going around school telling everyone these lies? No, not at all. Gabby, sweetie, honey, look, you don't have to lie to fit in around here. We accept everyone exactly as they are, tacky boots and all. But I never-- I didn't-- Hey, don't get all worked up. It's okay. You're amongst friends. I mean, I personally thought you were amazing at tryouts yesterday. Yeah. You're a true natural. But as a friend and a fellow dancer, one bit of advice: You better be careful walking around in those big boots. You never know when you might trip and fall. Anyways, we better get to class. [singsong voice] My mom just hates a tardy teenager. [mouths word] [bell ringing] [sighs] Hi. I was wondering if I could see a counselor. Well, they're all with students right now. But if you wanna take a seat, somebody will be with you shortly. All right. Thank you. Let me guess. Busted for trying to run someone over? You know, that stupid car of yours isn't gonna save you from the wrath of Karma. And what are you, the Karma police? I'm surprised someone like you even knows who Radiohead is, let alone how to make reference to them in some childish pun. Well, maybe I'll call the fictitious fashion police, and we can make a convicted felon out of you as well. Brad, you can have your cell phone back. I see. Oh, Gabriella. How can we help you, dear? Are you settling in all right? Yes. Thanks. I just wanted to see a counselor about a subject change. What are we changing? Oh, I wanted to get into Mr. Owens' eighth period jazz class. I'm sorry, dear, but his classes are all booked up for the semester. But I made it as a finalist for the competition. Isn't it required? Oh, you did? Well, in that case, I suppose it is. Mr. McBride. [sighs] If you didn't do so well on the pop quiz, I suggest you study twice as hard for the exam. This is especially suggested for you, Mr. McBride. You know, perhaps if you spent as much time reading as you do texting... Very good, Gabriella. What, no more mockery for the Colonel? [chuckles] [door closes] Hey! Over here. Gabby, this is Ken. Ken, this is my new friend Gabby. I remember you from tryouts. You have amazing technique. Thanks. Blessed with square feet and even toes, I suppose. Ken's won state, like, a gazillion times, and we've even partnered together a few times since he moved here last year. And what an honor it's been lifting a lightweight like Danna. So, uh, are you two pairing up for the challenge? Actually, no. It appears Gabby already has a partner. Oh! Mmm. Well, if you're stealing our knight in shining armor, I'm taking your Indian princess away from you. What do you say, Danna? One more do-up for old time's sake? Totes! There's no one I would rather choreograph for. [quiet chatter] Well, hello, everyone. How are you doing? Great. Good. First of all, I'd like to congratulate each and every one of you. Competition was fierce this year. So, fortunately, you guys made my job a heck of a lot easier. No need to worry about that. What you do need to worry about is the next eight weeks and how they're gonna pan out for each of you. There's gonna be a lot of work, a lot of sweat and a lot of hours coming up with those routines, which must be approved by Miss Rhodes and myself by the end of January. So I wanna make absolutely sure that you're ready for this. Well, are you? [students] Yeah. Come on. I know you can do better than that. Are you ready to dance? [whooping] You did awesome. Hey, Gabby. Here's my number. Text me this weekend, and we'll figure out a time for me to show you my piece. Cool? Yeah. Great. Ohh! [squeals] [chattering] Bye. Bye. Bye. Oh! Uh... [chuckles] [sighs] Can I help you? Can I uncover my eyes now? Unless I can convince you to walk off the edge of a bridge first. What's the rush? Late for Pole Dancing 101? No. Just OD'd on A-hole and in dire need of detox. Okay. Wait. Wait. [chuckling] Come on. I was just joking. What do you want, McBride? Okay, look, I know I'm not really in a place to ask any favors-- No, you're not. So you'd be a flipping fool to even waste your breath. Okay. Gabby, please, just listen, all right? I'm being serious. I need help... in literature, or I'm gonna fail. What, so now you need my help, and suddenly I'm Gabby and not the Colonel anymore? Whatever. [sighs] [sighs] Ugh! Okay. Fine. I'll help you. But under one condition: You have to keep the texting to a bare minimum while we're studying, understood? Yes. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. Okay. Next week, meet me in the library after school. Tuesday, though, okay? Mondays I have rehearsal. Sweet. And, hey, if you ever need anything, I got your back, I swear.

Um, not exactly. [chuckles] I'm still waiting to see if it's more than a one-sided schoolgirl crush. So time will tell. If you wanna know how he really feels, I would take him some of these quesadillas. If that doesn't make him fall for you, I don't know what will. [both laugh] Why did Salinger title his book The Catcher in the Rye? No idea. [phone vibrating] Oh.

[scoffs] That's not jealousy, it's irritation. Will you please just try to answer the question? Fine. [sighs] Holden talks about catching the kids playing in the rye before they fall off a cliff. So, maybe he's talking about his little sister? He's protective of her like I am of mine. Okay, good. So, then, what makes Phoebe different than other characters like Sally or Mr. Antolini? Well, Phoebe's a kid, and since it seems he doesn't really trust any of the other characters, maybe he's afraid of her growing up, because he doesn't want her to become like all the rest of them. See? There. Now you have an explanation as to why Holden would want to be a catcher in the rye. Let's look at another one. It's Friday. [mockingly] Don't you have to get to dance rehearsal with Shawn? He can't tonight. And why do you say it like that? Like what? So condescendingly, like dance is some sort of snobbery. I'll have you know it is a distinguished art form that has been around almost as long as humans have, and it is... What? Why are you making that face at me? No reason. I like dance just fine. So, then, what, are you jealous of the time I'm spending with Shawn? [scoffs] Oh, yeah. That's it. Please. So let's look at another one. Oh, I see someone left their Facebook page open. What do you think, Jude? Should Gabs here friend request Mr. Shawn Furst? Do it, and I'll cut the cords from your iPod earbuds. Chill, Testy Tina. I'm waiting for him to request me. And besides, I'm not that into him. [laughing] Lies. In the words of our fave Neapoly poop, "You're amongst friends. There's no need to lie to us." Why is she such a tyrant? Oh, gosh. She's always been like that. She and Mal used to sit on the monkey bars and yell, "Judy with the big booty!" 'Cause they knew she couldn't climb up there and kick their butts. Seriously? Mm. Monster. She actually toned down a bit when she was dating Brad. But that ship sailed. Oh, yeah. How's tutoring him going? You're tutoring Brad? Yeah. Uh, why? He needed help in lit, so-- Uh-uh. But you hate him. You said going to first period with him every day was like waking up with your brother's pet toad. It is. Uh, but wait. Did you say that Brad and Valerie dated? Yeah. Brad and Val used to dance for years. They were like one of those unstoppable dance pairs you see in the movies. What? No way. Brad doesn't dance. He was just making fun of me for dancing. Um, but he did. Why do you think a guy like Brad would be at a school like Kensington anyway? He said he was in the science and engineering program like me. Uh, he is, but he also used to dance, like you. And that boy is darn good too. I'm gonna give him so much crap. But how long ago did they date? Well, Brad broke up with Val Thanksgiving of our junior year, and everyone had to duck low and run for cover until Hurricane Val passed and school let out for Christmas. But what's with all this concern anyway? Losing interest in Shawn already? No way. Shawn is leagues above Brad. I don't want Hurricane Val to find out I'm tutoring him and try to wipe me out before the big competition. No, no, no. No need to fear Hurricane Val, for there is a greater adversary. I give you Danna "the Freak" Tsunami. ♪♪ [hip-hop] ♪♪ [humming] [chattering] [snapping fingers] Come on. ♪ Let's grab some booty ♪ All right.

And just as smart as an iPhone. Or an iTouch. Oh, wait. How rude of me. I almost forgot to ask. How's your jazz number going with Gabby? Hmm? Wouldn't you like to know. I wasn't trying to be nosy. I was just concerned. Concerned? What for? I was just hoping you weren't having the same problems with Gabby that her last partner had. And that would be what? Her sudden inability to perform because she gets too emotional. Total daddy abandonment issues. Please. You girls are so full of it. I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I found her old school records in my mom's briefcase, and the last time our lovely little transplant was up to compete for state, she got this [exhales forcefully] colossal case of onstage jitters. Major meltdownage. But think about it. Has she ever mentioned why she quite dance back home to begin with? Exactly. Now, look, Fallon's out, and my mom offered to clear it with Alex for you and I to team up. So, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. You're such an amazing performer, I'd hate to see something as stupid as a poor choice in partner become the reason your entire career went... [small explosion] [slurred] I was talking to your Aunt Belinda earlier tonight, and she was telling me that you haven't been making most of your shifts at the hospital. And then she was telling me what you're really up to. Mom, I can explain. But, Gabby, why didn't you just tell me you were tutoring someone? Oh. I'm-- I'm sorry. I-I just didn't-- It's fine. It's fine. I just kept wondering why you were coming home so late, and... Just give me a hug. Oh. I'm sorry. Sorry. It's okay. Mm. [knocks] Gabby, you're early. Yeah. Can I talk to you for a minute? Sure. Is everything all right? Yeah. Um... It's just I haven't told my mom I'm doing the competition. Your parents don't approve? Well, my dad does. Did. Um, he was always the one encouraging me to dance. He would take me back and forth to rehearsal when I was a kid. Does he know you're back in it? No. My parents divorced last year. And then right after that, he started dating a younger woman. That's when I quit dance. I think I probably did it to get back at him. Well, what does your mom think? I think she's worried that if I don't become a doctor, I'll end up dependent on some man, living alone off alimony like she did. For most people, dance is a lofty goal, but you're good, Gabby. I really believe you and Shawn can go all the way to state. You do? Yeah, I do. So you think I should tell her? I was gonna wait until after the competition to see if we advanced, but-- Wait. If you advance? Honey, that's your problem. Your mom's not holding you back, you are. Do you really want this, Gabby? For the first time in my life, I can honestly say yes. Good. Then tell your mother that you've entered the competition and that you're going to win. I guarantee the minute you start believing in yourself, others will too. Natalie, what can I do for you? I just wanted to pop in and inform you you and Cynthia might have to do a bit of tweaking the roster for our upcoming dance competition. Wait a minute. What are you talking about? Shawn and Valerie came to see me today to ask if it'd be okay for them to swap and become partners. I hope you told them it's out of the question. I mean-- Alex, I'm sorry. I already told them they could. Can you kids excuse us a minute? What do you think you're doing? Oh, Valerie's a fast learner, and she's more than obliged to learn Shawn's approved routine. What about Gabby and Fallon? Fallon supported her decision without question. And as far as Miss Colussi's concerned, I guess you'll just have to inform her she needs to find a new partner and routine. In three weeks? We made more than enough accommodations for Miss Colussi. Now, if Gabriella truly understands what a privilege it is she gets to compete at a school like ours in the first place, she'll understand the necessity that lies herein.

[sighs] Hey, guys, Mom's gonna be okay. Can we see her now? Honey, I am so sorry. Mom, shh. Everything is fine. We're just glad you're okay. Hey, I'm the mom. I'm the one who's supposed to be telling you that. And how are we feeling this morning, Ms. Colussi? Like an awful mom.

And the same to you. And well, well, what do we have here? Your very own Valentine's Day dance telegram, or hip-hop for beginners, Mr. McBride? Gabby, what are you doing here? Wait. You two know each other? This is the girl I was telling you was tutoring me in lit. We sit next to each other in class. This is the girl? Wait. Ginger's your mother? Yep. Meet Little Miss Hot Pants. You know, the one I'm always texting. So wait. That would make you... So, Gabby, my son is who you're always complaining is driving you nuts in class every day? [awkward laugh] I should have known. And so you're the son who loves Robot Unicorn Attack. [laughing] [sighs] And this is my daughter Maggie. Hi, Maggie. I like your moves. I'm a dancer myself. I just started taking classes like my brother used to. But he says I'm still an amateur. Don't listen to what he says. Brothers aren't always right. And I happen to think you're a born natural. Thanks. You're welcome. Um, can I talk to you outside a minute? [sighs] [chuckles] Okay. So I didn't tell you I used to dance. What's the big deal? So you remember way back when you were failing and you needed my help, and you promised you'd have my back if I ever needed anything? Well, now is that time. Okay. What do I need to do? I want you to be my dance partner. Wait. What happened to Shawn? Shawn dropped me yesterday, and the only way I'm gonna get to compete is if you help me. Gabby, I can't. I haven't danced in, like-- Almost as long as I had. But, see, that's the great thing about dance. It never really goes away, does it? Yes, it does. For me, it did. Because you associate it with something bad from your past just like I did. But, look, you can't give up everything you love just because you and Val broke up. Wait. How did you... Whatever. Look, it doesn't matter, all right? I just-- I just can't help you, Gabby. I'd end up sabotaging your entire routine. So you'd rather Val and Shawn win this entire thing? Yeah. Your ex is the reason I can't compete. She stole Shawn from me. [Alex] Principal Harper-- she walked in and dropped in on my meeting with Gabby-- [knocking] Gabby. I don't know what to say-- Say you'll let Brad McBride replace Shawn Furst as my new partner. I thought you were done with dance. Uh, well, I was, and then the more I thought about it, I realized that this might be the last chance I ever get, right? So, why the heck not? [Alex] I mean, if you're sure about it. What about school requirements? I mean, he's not even in the class. [Alex] If Harper can break the rules a bit, so can we. All right, then, you guys. Go for it. [Alex] Wait. There's only one more thing. We're barely a month away from competition. So do you guys have a routine prepared?

You're still here? You didn't get enough of me at rehearsal? Where's your car? My mom needed it for a date tonight, so she just dropped me off this morning. It's her first date since she's been sober, so far be it from me to stop her. Why didn't you just tell me? I'd offer you a lift. Oh, it's such a nice night and all, I just thought I'd walk. It's kind of a long walk. All right. Come on, Colonel. Get in. Okay. This collection is insane. A lot of those are my dad's. He was into music too. Your mom mentioned that once. You know, she still talks about him, like-- As if he were still alive. I know. Actually, I was gonna say, like she was still crazy in love with him. [chuckles] Yeah. They were good together. You're definitely not the son I expected her to have. Why? How did she describe me? Handsome, funny, kind. She said you used to dance and loved music. So you think I'm ugly, mean, and boring? Uh... [chuckles] No-- No, I just meant... Honestly, I just thought she had a hot son who was still in the closet. So now I'm gay. Uh, no, I... Ugh! I mean, here I am, picturing every girl's dream guy and thinking there's no way he could possibly be straight. So now I'm your dream guy. That was before I knew it was you. [laughs] You know, you really shouldn't judge a book by its cover any more than, say, one dancer should judge another because she's got on combat boots. Okay. So you're not as much of a slimy toad as I thought you were. [chuckling] There. You happy now? [chuckling continues] Um, anyway, thanks for the ride. Will I see you at school tomorrow? Yeah. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three and four, five and six, seven, eight. One, two, three and four... [sighs] What now? Don't you feel even a little bad about Gabby and Fallon? You know, I'll feel a whole lot worse if we don't win this thing. Let's go again from the top. Valerie, I'm exhausted. We need to sleep at some point, too, you know? We can sleep once we've taken state. [sighs] I don't even understand why we're doing a second routine. The one I choreographed is fine. Well, Mother says, "Any great dancer always has a second routine on hand." I'm sure your mom would also agree that any great dancer needs their sleep so they don't screw up on stage. [scoffs] Great dancers don't screw up. If they do, they deserve to lose. Now let's go again from the top. Five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three and four, five and six, seven, eight. Hey. Hey. So, uh, how was your mom's date? She used one word to describe it-- lackluster. But she said the food was good there, so... Cool. I was just-- wanted to see if you maybe wanted to get together and rehears tomorrow. I was thinking we could watch some of my old Dance TV tapes. You know, get some inspiration. You watched Dance TV? I used to love that show growing up. Me too. Best performance? Would have to be Patrick and Sarah-- [together] "Showstoppers, Season 6." Me too. Get out! I can't believe that. I still dream about that performance. I mean, I was thinking we could watch them after we rehearse. Okay. Yeah. That sounds like fun. And then maybe we can go out and grab some food or whatever. You know, we can try that place where your mom says has really good food. Okay. Cool. Tomorrow. Rehearsal and food. I'm down. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Sweet. Uh, I guess I'll see you in class, then. Yeah. So Gabby is invited to my insanely exclusive annual spring soiree. Yay! [laughs] And why would you invite Gabby? Well, uh, this year, it's not just any old soiree. As Val and Fal's BFF and social cordy of the Neapolys, I planned this party at my parents' pad first and foremost for all you tried-and-true finalists forging forth in this year's spring competition. So it'd be a real shame if Gabs missed out. Well, tell Mallory thanks, but Gabs can't. I have plans. Tsk. Oh! Well, that's too bad. You know, just hang on to it anyway, just in case. [chuckles] She's not coming. I'm pretty sure I heard her making plans with Brad. Ugh! No. She has to come. If not, we'll have no way of convincing her Brad gave us all her drunk mother's leftover booze. Don't have a melty just yet. Mallory Medicine has a plan. [sighs] I mean... you're not really thinking about going, are you? [Gabby] Of course not. Besides, I already have plans to rehearse and go to dinner with Brad, so... What? Like a date? Ooohhh! No, you guys. Not like a date. Stop it. [laughing] Oh, my gosh. Hey, Gabby. You-- You got a minute? Um, sure. Um, what's up? Not much. Um, how are you settling in? Good. Better than before, anyway. Sweet. So, um... Yeah, I didn't know exactly what you're up to this weekend, but I was wondering if you already had a date to Mal's? Um, I'm flattered, but I kind of can't go to the party tomorrow, so... Oh. You, uh, got other plans? Yeah. Sort of. Sorry. Hey, no worries. It's... Can't knock the guy for trying, right? Uh, all right. I guess I'll just, uh, see you around. Bye. Okay. Excuse me. Do you know where I can find this book? [Girl] Okay. So you really think Dylan's gonna ask you to Mal's party? 'Cause I'm pretty sure he's gonna ask that new girl, Gabby what's-her-face. [Girl #2] Seriously? But he's been flirting with me for weeks. [scoffs] News flash, Jenna. Dylan Palermo flirts with everybody. But apparently Gabby's little unattainable "I'm so innocent" act has made her top tier. But I thought she was into McBride. What? No way. She's totally just using him to try and compete in the competition with Val and Shawn. She's into Dylan. In fact, I overheard they totally hooked up. They did? Mm-hmm. When? Start of the semester. When the poor thing was still vulnerable enough to be preyed on. But how do you know it's true? Because that pudgy pal of hers, Jude what's-her-butt-- Let's just say the girl has a hard time keeping her loosey lips shut. Probably because they're always loaded with a big, fat lollipop. Oh, your first paid acting gig, girls. And based on Brad's face, looks like you put in Oscar-worthy performances. Whoever said our theater program here didn't compare to its dance? Now all you have to do is talk to Dylan, and the rest, including Gabby's shot at regionals, is history. Go. So this restaurant my mom went to-- Yeah, um, about that. I-- I forgot. I told Maggs I'd take her to see a movie. I can't go tomorrow. Oh, okay. Then, um-- Well, that sounds like fun. You mind if I join? That probably wouldn't be such a good idea. We should just, uh, stick to weekday rehearsals like you said, you know? Oh. O-Okay. Sure. ♪♪ [rock] I just don't get it. I mean, what could I have possibly done to piss him off so badly? He saw me talking to Dylan, but I said no. Why does it matter if he's mad at you or not? You guys are dance partners. You don't need to be best friends. Unless you want something more. Ohhh! No. No. I just don't want there to be any tension for the competition. It could mess up our performance, you know? Gabby, you're a terrible liar. Terrible. I'm not lying. Okay. Sure. Maybe Brad is acting all weird because he likes you too. No. No way. Wait. You think? Unless there's somewhere else he'd rather be. What do you mean? I may have, could have possibly, may not have heard Jenna and Candace in the theater talking about Brad going to Mal's party to see Val. [Gabby] What? N-No way. He wouldn't. I mean, would he? There's only one way to find out. Yes. Let's go. ♪♪ [techno blaring] ♪♪ [continues] Oh, there's Ken. I'm gonna go say hi. Danna, we came here to look for Brad. And I will look for him... over there. Hey, how are you? [no audible dialogue] You see Booty Brown Brad anywhere? No, but I see Mallory dancing. Girl, you call that dancing? [scoffs] 'Cause I got another name for it. Crap, I think Valerie just saw me. Girl, don't fret that frosted flake. I got your back. We're just gonna find Brad, you're gonna tell him what's up, gonna get the-- Hello, hot Jesus with a cowboy hat! Wanna-- Ooh. Hey, boo! Jude! So, my fellow Italiano made it after all. Either that, or she was planning on coming the whole time and just dissed me. Oh, no, not at all. My plans fell through last minute, so here I am. Oh, sad to hear. That's a lie. I'm thrilled that you're here. I don't care what the circumstance. I'm sorry. Here. Have some crushed berry punch. Oh, thanks. Yeah. And, uh, shall we dance? Sure. Oh, my God, this punch is so yummy. It's all sugar and booze. There's booze in this? I shouldn't be drinking it. ♪♪ [continues] That looks tasty. You got one for me? Perhaps. Whatcha gonna do for it? Ow! Oh! Well, tickle my tiara. [shouts] Gabby, you came! [laughs] Yeah. This is great. But why are you having a 4th of July luau on April the 4th? So it's kind of like Jesus and Christmas, since no one actually knows when the birth of our nation actually was. Uh, pretty sure it was the 4th of July. Were you there? Okay, then. [laughing] [mutters] Yeah. Gabby! I'm so happy you could make it. Here we are. Val, you want one? Oh, no. Give mine to Gabby. I gotta watch my sugar intake. I'm already too sweet as it is. Um, have either one of you seen Brad tonight? Um, no. I don't think I have. But, hey, if you see him before I do, let him know I'm looking for him. I still have to thank him for buying all the booze for this soiree. B-Booze? What booze? The booze you're slugging back as we speak, dear. Wait. Brad didn't tell you? I thought you guys were so tight these days. He brought this whole trash bag of it over the other night. It was a bunch of rum and vodka-- Will you excuse me for a moment? Oh-ho-ho! Oh, honey, are you all right? It's okay, Gabby. I got you. Um, yeah. Just a little light-headed. Oh, sweetie, you don't look so hot. Um, Dylan, why don't you take her inside for a second and let her lie down? Okay. It's okay. Come on. [both chuckle] Excuse me. Fal? You okay? Yeah. I'm okay. It's just Valerie ditched me for the competition for Shawn, so now I'm out. I at least wanted to compete. I know what you mean. Do you remember back in fifth grade when Val pushed me over during an arabesque at our recital? I guess vaguely, but not really. It was the same day that Miss Foster told me I had the best arabesque she had ever seen. So, clearly, Val lashes out when she feels threatened. And I imagine dancing alongside a dancer as awesome as you is no exception to the rule. For Val, winning is everything, even if it means her friend doesn't get to compete. I'd hardly call her a friend now. Why are you being so nice to me? I haven't exactly been the nicest to you over the years. Well, I also remember who helped me up after Val walked away. Who? Me? I don't remember. Well, I do. So how about you let me help you wipe up that runny mascara, [singsong voice] and we'll go party. [chuckles] Okay. [grunts] Hey. Oh-- [chuckles] [sighs] Better? Mm.

Must've been the same brats who convinced Jude that you were ditching me tonight to come to this party. Why did you come here? Dylan? What? No. I don't even know Dylan. And why would that have bugged you so much anyway? Look, Dylan and Valerie hooked up when me and my mom and sister left town to see a cancer specialist two Thanksgivings ago. Or so I heard. No wonder you tried to run him over in the parking lot that day. We wanna give people the benefit of a doubt, and they end up being exactly who we thought they were. Do they? Okay, fine.

I mean, she'll still be able to dance, don't you think? Dance? Mom, I can explain. Gabby, have you been drinking? It's not what it looks like. No? 'Cause it looks to me that you snuck out past curfew to go drink with this boy you've been tutoring. And you've been lying to me about dancing and God knows what else? Mrs. Colussi, it is not Gabby's fault. It was-- I think you need to leave right now, young man. [groaning] Well, all of your X-rays came back fine. Looks like it's just a light sprain. Sounds like those boots saved you from a nasty injury. Can I still dance? Not if you're grounded for life. Should you be allowed to do so, yes. But I would give it till the end of the week. Let the swelling and the bruising go down first. Thank you. Honey, I think we need to talk. Why did you lie to me about dancing? I don't know. I thought you wouldn't let me do it. Gabby, I never said you couldn't do something. I just thought I would do it one more time for fun, to get it out of my system, but then-- You realized how much you wanted it, and that scared you. Yeah, I guess so. I feel like I'm the one that put all of that doubt in your head to begin with. And I should have never let you give it up in the first place. But I knew you were angry with your father, and, uh, I kind of used you to get back at him. And when you came home the other night and I could smell the alcohol on you... it was like I was looking at me. And I have been projecting all of my insecurities onto you, and I am so sorry for that. If dance is what you love, then that is absolutely what you need to be doing. Medical school-- it'll be there if you ever change your mind, right? Thanks, Mom. But why the sudden change of heart? Well, for starters, you never told me that some little jerk spiked your punch when you were at that party the other night. Wait. How did you... [chuckles] I'll leave you two kids alone to talk for a couple minutes, okay? So, how's the ankle? Um, it's good, I guess. That's good. You think you can dance on it? Um, I hope so. And thanks for talking to her. I don't think she ever would've believed me if I'd explained it. No worries. Why did you do it? I wanted to see you. I realize that you never really explained to me why you went to Mal's party searching for me to begin with. Oh, uh... I guess the idea of us being mad at each other just really bothered me for some reason. Yeah. Me too. But no big deal, right? I mean, I was only mad at you because those girls lied, and you were only mad at me 'cause you thought I was dumb enough to fall for a guy like Dylan, right? It was more so the thought of you and him... or you and anyone, for that matter. And why is that? It is getting hot all up in here. [laughs] Max! Max! ♪♪ [classical] [Joe] Gabby? Dad? Is that you?
