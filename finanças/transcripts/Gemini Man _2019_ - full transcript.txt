He ran away Henry He is you What? There's a DNA lab here, I gave them samples From the baseball cap he wears He looks a lot like you, so I thought he was your son or something They did 3 tests Your DNA and him All three are identical again Not similar, identical Like from the same person He is your clone I guess I made a mistake, I gave the same person sample, but I didn't He is you How is that possible? It's complicated, but it's possible All you need is a surrogate mother, and a DNA sample Clone someone You think they're clones of doctors or scientists Not me They can clone Nelson Mandela Nelson Mandela cannot kill people on a moving train from a distance of 2 kilometers Where is your brother Before this begins, I must admit, I have admired your work for many years Wait, so are you know who i am?

My government lied to me, and tried to kill me, if that was what you meant In Russia, we call that Tuesday America, they hurt your feelings So Why did Durmal try to return to Russia Why I was sent to kill him. Yes, straight to business You are a busy person We are both friends with Jack He's a good guy And he died like you But the reason you're here And I have not killed you Not yet ... because we have the same enemy Clay Verris He lured Dorman to the west, funding his lab And now he has got the fruit from his hard work Dolly the Sheep was cloned in 96, but in 95. I'm the sheep Consider it a compliment And you're the only one With your DNA, Verris raised the child as her own child Train him to be the most perfect killer So why is he trying to leave? For years we tried to lure him back, without success Last year they fell He was scared, contacted me. Then it happened That still doesn't explain why I was sent to kill him We have an indication Dormar gets a breakthrough Modifying human DNA For mass production But the warriors created by Dormal are stronger Smarter, that ... That was before a matter What thing? Mr. Brogan You are the best of what you do, but still you get tired You have feelings of fear, doubt, pain, You have conscience This makes you human, not optimal for warriors Less than perfect More unprofitable Clay Verry plays with God's DNA He must be stopped If it's dangerous, I'll send a missile Blow up the lab That's what we do Except you Is the missile I wish you good luck Oh, one more thing You ran away from home two days ago We make it work I'm at the end of my chair Wait what? What do you know about that? I'm a big fan, what can I say? - What? - Just sending you You know you're 51 years old.

Now, I have your agent with me against his will Danny Zakarweski, he wants to come back - No, like me, he's a patriot Unlike me, he still wants to spend decades Doing work for you bastards His safety cannot be bargained The person you sent is after me in Cartagena Don't think about sending someone else Family reunion, very sweet Go on, you will be the first person I kill for free How fast can you take him to Budapest 5 minutes Nice He was in the palace courtyard at midnight Enjoy your Lattemu Adios bastard. - How did he know we were here? This should work, right Yes How do you know I know the flavor Wait, you want to say you're interested in me? I? Now? No But a younger, less mature version is possible But I have come for you in Georgia I didn't think about that, that was instinct He was born with that too Besides that, he wants me On page Sorry mom Before we get further, I want you to undress What? I have to make sure you don't use bugs Okay, first of all Ma'am I was raised to respect my elders Open your shirt please Turn around, please You have to be thorough? Caution that keeps me alive Call her Brogan In 12 minutes, I will put 2 bullets behind his head You were ordered to deliver him safely My command is to kill you Do you understand the Court Chambers of Catacombs Negative, we do it in an open place, where I can see you Now you have 11 minutes Wear clothes, we walk That is a smart move Where are you from? This is formality You think of using me as Outside of Atlanta You have a lot of similarities I doubt that You will be surprised You know, I started following him too, just like you did then I know him He has a big heart, like you What do you know about my heart I know you have one I know that telling you something about the job you were given is not true Work is work How much did you pay to become a guardian Left Open the chain Basement You must know this city I watch Natgeo a lot He said it was forbidden to enter How many people are buried here? Stand there You have no light, how do you see your way out Grenades are no joke, I mean, I understand the idea Darkness neutralizes its great power, and closed space is stable for you, right? I mean, you can't throw a grenade without killing me too But what if he tries gas? You know, some kind of sedative Far in front of me, the gas mask, it's very smart. / Over there Plastic straps, definitely for me Can I ask something? Can you stop long enough for me to answer How do you know that? Somebody tell you why they want that person dead? 8 agents in one night That's what they say to you. That's what he did No, not really, I'm there And I know the agents were killed They were sent to kill him, and me by Gemini And no problem, he was shot in Virginia, and they died in Savanah Henry can shoot long distances, but he can't shoot that far Come on, just think, does that make sense to you? Do you understand what I mean? That does not .. Hmmm Get up, leave Stay there Thank you Do you want to light it? Jeez Thanks for the tips on the grenade You talk to him all the time You serve someone or you don't And for the record I do not want to kill you But I certainly will if I have to What Clay Verris said about me Let me tell you about him Because I know Mr. Verris very well How did he start you? Hunting for birds, rabbits? Around 12 years of shooting deer I guessed 19 The first 20 years he ordered you to shoot humans Any of these are correct? Yes He told you to lean on your fear Because you are a knight Which is given great talent to defend the weak But he could not stop his voice The secret part of you that is always different from the others The part that feels like a weird person You know nothing Son, I know you are outside in front of back You're allergic to bees, you hate it Solantro, you always sneeze 4 times Everyone hates Solantro You are thorough Overall, disciplined, persistent You like puzzles You're a chess player, right? That's great, I bet, but you also suffer from insomnia It never lets you sleep And even when yes, it attacks you with nightmares I'm talking about 3 o'clock that morning A nightmare that someone saved me for And then there's doubt, that's the worst You hate them, and you hate yourself for having them, it makes you feel weak True warriors have no doubts, right? The only time You have truly felt happy Is you close to your stomach and will squeeze the trigger And at that moment The world makes sense How do you think I know it all I don't care how you know anything Look at me! Stupid! Look at us! 25 years ago, your father took my blood, and he cloned me He got you from me! Our DNA is identical He told you the truth He chose me because there was never anyone like me And he knows that one day I will get old, and then you come in He lied to you all this time He tells you are orphans And of all people in the world why did he send you? Because I'm the best You are definitely not the best You are stubborn It must be your birthday or something I have to die, and you have to do it As long as I'm alive somehow Clay's experiment is incomplete You pull the trigger for a maniac. - Shut your mouth about him You're just trying to shake me. - I'm trying to save you! Are you? 23 years? Still a virgin, right?

Always believe You would be happier not knowing Happy You know what I'm happy about, dad? When I close my stomach I almost squeezed the trigger That's the only time I'm happy This is not even a mistake It's not like you make someone pregnant and have to be male And raise me, no, you make decision To get scientists Make people from other people. That's not it. That's the truth And you send me to kill him, out of all the shooters in the world, why you Send me He is your darkness. You have to get through this yourself Maybe you are my darkness The lie you told me And my parents throw me in the fire department Don't believe that You know how that makes me feel?
