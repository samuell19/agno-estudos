The man of the hour's here...! Grab a seat over there. - Fill up his glass...! - The guest of honour has arrived! Please raise your glasses, everyone. Let us drink to Iida Makoto The winner of the 2015 Tokyo Photo Grand Prix! Can I say that again? The winner! Cheers! - Guys, cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! I wish I'm half as good as he is. What's lacking? Salt? What? Not enough salt. - Thirsty? - Yeah. Have you decided what to submit? Not yet. - How about you, Shingo? - Nope. - Here. - Thanks. Natsumi. I might move back home. What do you think? I mean... maybe I'm not cut out for this. Photography requires talent. And my family has been brewing sake for 200 years. I can't let the business close down in my generation. Brewing sake isn't so bad. Are you really fine with that? Hey. Hey. Natsumi? "Natsumi's Firefly" Where are they? Hello? - Welcome. - Hello. Do you have bread? Over there. Wow... I'll have this. - That will be 350 yen. - All right. That's some camera you got. Is it good? Well... there are better cameras that would give you more beautiful pictures. Then why are you using this camera? How should I put it? This camera gives depth to photos. That's what I like. Sounds like this is more than just a hobby. I study photography. - I see. You're a student. - Yes, I am. And somehow you ended up in this remote part of the world. Good morning, Jizo! Good morning. - Good morning! - Good morning. - Can you give me a while? - Sure. Your first customer in weeks. What a rare sight! You talk too much. Jiro, today's the last day of school! Oh, it's summer vacation. Yes, but we'll still go to the pool! Don't forget that! Okay! - Bye! - See you! Be careful! Good morning! Hi! Is Jizo your real name? (Jizo: Guardian diety of children) No, I don't know why they call me that. Because you're the local kids' protector? Nothing of the sort. Is that yours? Yes. People don't expect me to have a ride like that. Not many women do. I love my motorcycle. What's your name? Kawai Natsumi. I was born in the height of a beautiful summer, and hence my name. I see. What's wrong? Nothing. It's a cool motorcycle. Thanks. I've seen guys on bike like that, riding through here. Is that right? Thanks. Wait. Why don't you come in and rest? No, I'm fine. Thanks. Have some watermelon. Okay, I'll just have a little. Eat up. We have more than we can finish. Thank you. I won't stand on ceremony then. Are you going to teach photography next time? That'd be nice. That sounds all right. I'm tucking in! It's delicious! Are there fireflies around here? - Fireflies? - Yes. I'm not sure. We haven't seen any recently. Why do you ask? Are you here to photograph fireflies? Yes. I camped on the other side of the river and looked all night... but I couldn't find any. - All night? - Yes. I took breaks in the tent though. That's dangerous. The river could overflow. You can stay here if you want. Good idea. We have an empty room in the back. - I appreciate it but I'm OK. - Are you sure? Camping is fun and it's the best way to see fireflies. I'll be careful. This is really good! I won't stay here but may I have another slice? Help yourself. "Take General Store" All right. I caught a dragonfly! I caught a dragonfly! Stop parroting me! There she is! There she is! What a cool tent! - It's so cool. - What are you doing here? Sorry to impose. - Sorry to impose. - Please come in. We were looking all over for you. Mr Jizo said he knows where you can find the fireflies. What? There's a stream behind Take General Store. - Really? - Yes. Come on. - Come on! - OK. My son had an accident at a construction site. Fireflies! Come out! Come out! Kids, you're spooking the fireflies. When I was a kid, they were everywhere. Sorry, we dragged you out here for nothing. When I was a kid, my dad brought me here to see fireflies. Is that why you're here? Sort of. Dad, where are they? Look! Wow! There are so many of them! Over there! Look, over there. There are more there. So your father is... I missed him so I came here... hoping to photograph the fireflies. Well, I got some great scenery shots, so it's not a wasted trip. It's a firefly! A firefly! - Where is it? - Look, there's a firefly over there! You're right, it's really a firefly! It's so pretty! So many fireflies! Yeah, five fireflies. A hundred of them! There used to be thousands of them. Really? If only these were real fireflies. - Here. - Thank you. Here, all set. We'll try upstream tomorrow. It's OK. I got a nice photo of the firefly we saw. No, that won't do. Thank you for the food. Looks delicious. This is so good! - Eat your fill! - I will. There's something... I want to ask of you. May I bunk here for a while? Is the food that good? The food is great and also... I want to take more photos of you. Us? No! I'd make a terrible model! - You'll be fine. - No way! No, I can't! You too, Keizo. Oh, no. I'd feel self-conscious. One more thing. I'd really like to take a bath. You know what? Our bath is heated by wood fire. It makes the water softer. Wow! I never knew that. Not tonight though, it's been out of use. I'll clean the tub tomorrow. - Thank you! - Oh, that's right. Come with me. This way. I'll make your bed here. Thank you. Please let me do that. One, two! Here we go. Good morning! Hello? Good morning. Yes. Really? Yes. Okay. Here I am. You sound like a girl. This is where you came with your dad? Still hung up on your dad? Not really, but I'm looking for answers, just like you are. I have a feeling I'll find something here. It's much cleaner now. Let's make it spotless! Do you think Mr Jizo will be happy? He'll say, "Wow, it's spotlessly clean!" This is my classmate, Shingo. Nice to meet you, sir. I have one favour to ask. Can he stay here too? In your room? No, in a separate room. I'll pay you. There's an extra room... I appreciate it. Thank you! Thanks. Is Keizo the answer you're looking for? Well, one of the answers maybe. Wow! It's spotlessly clean. It's so clean you could have your sports day here. Mr Jizo, look! I kept the dandelion! You're such good kids. This is Jizo's dandelion. - Do you like dandelions, Jizo? - What? Sort of. I'm hungry! OK, let's go home. Bye. Let's go. - See you tomorrow. - Bye! Bye, kids! - Take care! - See you. - Bye! - Can we play tomorrow? Sure, we can. Shingo said he would play with us. Bye, guys! - I got good photos. - Good. We're back. I've seen you around. He's Mr Ungetsu. He's a sculptor. He lives in a hut by the river. A sculptor? He makes Buddhist statues. How much are the two of you paying to stay here? Don't tell me you're staying for free! These kids are not like that! Don't be so hard on them. We invited them to stay with us. We've already discussed the terms. We pay in the form of cleaning the house, tending the shop... and of course, we pay for our meals. By the way, what you're drinking now is expensive sake he brought for them! Heart of Gold... it's good. Natsumi, wait... I'm sorry if he offended you. He's not a bad person. It's okay. The bath has revived me. He moved here about five years ago. My son and he bonded as they're both divorced. I hope you can forgive him. Jizo was married? Yes, he was. But it was a long time ago. How's the temperature of the water? Couldn't be better. Rock, paper, scissors! Rock, paper, scissors! The bus is coming. That's right. - See you later! - Bye! - See you, kids! - See you! Be careful! Good one. Take a photo with Keizo. - No, I'm old and wrinkled. - Go on. Come on. Photos don't steal your soul. Ready? One more. I got one! Ready? Here we go! What did you catch? - You can do it! - Come on... What have we got here? Awesome! Will this do? - Yes, dear. - All right. - Do I add the prawns in too? - Go ahead. Here you go. - Looks great! - Natsumi made that. Did she? Let me try it. - Well? - It's delicious. Yay! Let's tuck in. This is really good. Shingo, so you will be brewing sake? Maybe. I can't quite make up my mind yet. At your age, it's natural to feel conflicted. My mum's right. Getting some good photos? Yeah. Good. - So? - What? You have something to tell me, don't you? Yes. Natsumi. Come to Nigata with me. What? My hometown's in the countryside. You can focus on your photography, like you do now. To be honest, I'm getting tired of photography. It's like we're only taking photos... to prove something. You wouldn't have to worry about getting a job. My parents really like you so they'd be happy if you came. Are you proposing to me? Well... I didn't mean that. Or maybe I am! I'll do it over properly another time. Natsumi? Natsumi! Where's Jizo? He felt tired so he's lying down. Here. 1026 yen, please. Here. Keep the change. But... Jizo and his old mother only have each other. Help them as much as you can. Thank you. Dad, this feels great! Yes, it sure does! Stop it. You might fall. Dad, Mum told me you used to be a racer. Why did you quit? Let's see... Maybe I got scared? Really? That's lame! You think so? You think your dad's lame? - Look at that! - Light more sparklers... - Is it out? - Yes. Behold, the ladies are here. Both of you look lovely! Thanks. Wow! Can I join in? - Sure! - OK, light some more. Light more fireworks for her. - May I? - Here. Try this one. Nearer to the top, kids. Give it some time. Thank you. - It's beautiful! - What do you think? Beautiful. - Light it. - Okay. He's good with kids. Mr Ungetsu's divorced. No way! He said it's hard to come up with the child support every month. But I envy him. Everyone, the bath is ready! I'll go first! Hitomi, we'll take our baths together. Okay! Were you talking about me? What kind of a father were you? Hey! So you were talking about me. I can't figure my dad out. Why not talk to him? He's gone. I see. He worked day and night without resting. And then he fell sick. I wonder if he was happy. Right. I know what you mean because... I choose work over family too. He was happy. There's nothing more fufilling than working to provide for your family. Right, Ungetsu? I couldn't even afford to raise my son. You regret getting a divorce? I don't regret that but... I wanted to thank my son. I wanted to thank him for choosing us as his parents. But I never had the chance. That's what I regret. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You really like dandelions, don't you? I love how dandelions... send their seeds... drifting in the wind after they flowered. I think it's wonderful. Let's try looking for fireflies again. Yes, we'll go a little farther up. Sure. - Keizo...! - Yes? I can't seem to find the duster! Do you know where it is? I saw it somewhere. Did it slip behind the TV? I wouldn't put it there! Shingo? I think... Oh my god! He collapsed! - Call an ambulance! - OK! Granny Yasu, we need your address and phone number. Hello? - We need an ambulance. - Your address and phone number. Yes. - Jizo! - That's right. - Are you alright? Jizo! - Yes. Jizo! It was a ruptured aneurysm. I'm sorry! You don't have to apologise. He's not allowed to go before me. He has already given me so much misery. It's none of my business but... did you get in contact with Jizo's ex-wife? That won't be necessary. She's the mother of your grandson. It's all too late now. It may be too late for you but... what about your son? You should stay out of our business. I know I'm just an outsider. But Jizo can't talk for himself now. Only you can, Granny Yasu. You can go home. No! You don't have to stay here. What do you mean? I'm saying this for them. Those two have been together for over fifty years. She doesn't need anyone's sympathy. - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! - Good morning! Can you give these to Jizo? I didn't know you could write on leaves. This is a leaf from the Mother of Thousands plant. For an adult, you sure are clueless. See, you can draw on it. Jizo showed me how when I was in kindergarten. This is cool. - The bus is here! - Here you go. - Bye! - See you, guys. See you! - Bye! - See you! - Good morning! - Good morning! Have a nice day! "Jizo, I love you." Keizo, everyone's waiting for you to come home. Granny Yasu, I have another favour to ask. Please contact Jizo's ex-wife and his son. Why is everyone badgering me about this? You're making me out to be the bad guy here. It's just that he talked about his ex-wife and son. That's all in the past now. No, it's not. I'm certain he wants to see them again. He's my boy. No one knows him like I do. Leave us alone! I guess we have no business worrying about them. Let's go home. So you're giving up? What? You're going to do as you're told? You give up way too easily, Shingo. That's why you can never be a professional photographer! Sorry. I think my dad... give up racing for me. I robbed my dad of his dream. That's why... the last thing I want... is for you to give up your dream for me. You're still here? What kind of statues do you make? Amitabha Tathagata, King Acala... and sometimes, Avalokitesara. I carve them from a single piece of wood. Do you know what I mean? No. When a sculpture is made by assembling several pieces of wood... it's easier to fix a mistake. You just need to redo one piece. Also, it's cheaper. But I do it differently. I carve a Buddha out of one block of wood. One tiny mistake and it's all ruined. I think I know what you mean. I shoot on film. Which means I can't check the photos until I've developed them. And if the film is exposed to light, my photos will be ruined in an instant. Maybe that's why I like it. As if you know anything! Pardon me. But that's how it is. Though I might never get to prove anything. What? I'm not sure if I'm even doing the right thing. What do I want to photograph? It's not about proving yourself. What matters is how determined you are. If you're not determined... you won't be able to prove a thing. Hello? Natsumi! Can you come? Jizo! Thank God...! I'm sorry I got you worried. Don't say that. I'm glad you woke up. You just rest well now, okay? Thank you. You too, Shingo. I've done nothing, sir. Mum. Everyone I want is here. So don't worry about me. I heard you. I heard your voice, Mum. Keizo. Tell me, dear. Do you want to see Kimihide? He has a new father now. I'm glad you didn't call him. Okay, son. Do you know who I wanted to see? Everyone here and... and... those two kids. Granny Yasu! I could've fetched you back if you had called me. It's okay, dear. - You'd better rest. - Thank you. The doctor says... his condition is still critical. Keizo named his son... after the two Kanji characters from the word "dandelion." "Dandelion" Dandelions never stay down... no matter how much they are stepped upon. It's a plant loved by everyone. A lot of thought went to his son's name. I see. Granny Yasu. Maybe we should contact his ex-wife and son after all. But he said... Oh, that boy! He's a terrible liar. May I trouble you to come along with me? I hate to say this, but I'm not brave enough to meet them alone. Miyako, I'm sorry to ask this of you out of the blue. Especially when the divorce was my son's idea... I've put it all behind me. You said that even if he was injured... you'd stay with him. That made me so pleased. But my son... He insisted that you wouldn't be happy with him. He was stubborn. Well, he takes after me. Please accept my apologies. Please don't say that. It's all in the past now. How is he? The doctor said we should be prepared for the worst. I'll see him. You will? Thank you! But Kimihide won't be able to go. Sorry. It's not that he's holding anything against Keizo. He doesn't wish to hurt his stepfather's feelings. You've raised a good boy. "Chiba General Medical Centre" Where shall I put this? Put it here. Thank you. Thank you for everything you've done. You've gone above and beyond for us. Thank you. I'm Kimihide. He's grown so big! Father. Thank you. Kimihide, thank you! Thank you for being my son. Thank you so much! You're right. It's good that we didn't give up. Yes. Sorry. I took my insecurities out on you. I'll stop running from reality. I'll take over my family business. Okay. Let's break up. I really love your photos, so don't give up on photography. Have you proven something with these? Well... I don't know. How about you? Have you ever worked hard only to end up with nothing to show for it? You're way too young to be worrying about that. All you have to do is prove yourself. I have to say this though. Look at Jizo in this photo. You caught something special. You look like a different man! Look! Thank you, Natsumi. Look at this, it's wonderful! It really is. Thank you. Now I can go with no regrets. Don't be morbid! You'll make your mother cry. Mum, listen. I finally got my third blessing. I've heard that before. That's written on the back of my photo. I think my dad wrote that. Right. Right. I'm sorry. I should have told you earlier. Some time after I got divorced... a motorcycle racer turned up at our place. Was it... my dad? Remember that first photo you took of me, Natsumi? When you looked me straight in the eye... it crossed my mind that you could be his daughter. Then I noticed that you had the same motorcycle. Your dad... He was depressed because his friend has died in a race. He was wondering if he should continue racing. So I told him this. Each of us gets three blessings in life. My husband used to say that. That's why he named him Keizo, meaning three blessings. The first blessing is being born in this world. The second is to be loved by your parents. And the third is... becoming a parent... and loving your child. Natsumi. Your dad... he loved you. He was the happiest man on earth. There's no reason for you to compare yourself with anyone. "Fukui Keizo" Dad... Thank you. - Hi Shingo! - It's been a while! Sorry, I'm late. I brought Jizo's favourite sake. It's good. It takes great effort to maintain the taste of sake from year to year. After working with my dad... I realised the value in preserving what we have. I just... want you and Jizo to know that. Get to the point! What do you want? I want you to make a sculpture of Jizo based on this photo. Granny Yasu told me... the kids are sad that Jizo's gone. You came to a professional to commission a work... with such a paltry sum? Sorry, but that's all I can afford. I'll pay the rest monthly. Little by little. By selling your photos? I don't know. Are you kidding me? I've decided not to take commercial photos. I want to take photos that will make people smiles and touch their hearts. That's what I want. Jizo and everyone here made me realised that. I'd call that naïve. I realise that too. But I'm not giving up. Fine, on one condition. As you know, I work with wood. Even if I use the best cypress... it'll eventually rot being out in the rain. All right? You'll need a shrine to protect it from the elements. A shrine? You'll build one. How? Figure it out yourself! Use this money for the shrine. Thank you! I'm not doing it for you. "Three years later" We're here. "Take General Store" We're back. I bet he's saying, "Nice to see you again!" Hey! There's Granny Yasu too! That's great of Ungetsu. Jizo was a blessed man. He sure was. Take my photo, will you? What, me? Make it good. I hate taking photos for a professional. Come on. We studied photography together! Ready? One more. "Thank you for watching over us" Is it here? Yes. - Hey. - Yes? After our baby's born... let's thank her for choosing us to be her parents. We'll tell her every day. Sure. It's Mummy and Daddy. ♪～ Where are they? ～♪
