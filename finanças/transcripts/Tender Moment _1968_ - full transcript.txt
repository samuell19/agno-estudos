For your next essay you will have to ponder over a moral topic. Write. "All men seek happiness," "even those who are about to hang themselves". Pascal. You don't seem to be inspired, gentlemen. - At first glance, it seems pretty muddled. Why that? - If I'm about to hang myself, it means I have no hope left. And certainly not for happiness. - Hanging yourself means you're unhappy. But quiet and peaceful once it's done. Note that quietness and happiness are not exactly the same thing. Besides, Pascal is like Descartes. You have to take it for what it's worth. And for you, Fermaux, what is happiness? Well, happiness is.. It's... It's not easy to explain... - Good-bye, gentlemen. See you tomorrow. Good-bye! - Bye! What will I say when I'm there? - Anything you want. I have arranged everything. No problem. And nobody will know? - No one but me. You have no idea how important it is for me. - Calm down. It's very simple. See you at three? - Yes, at three o'clock. Bye. The Private Lesson At this hour, there are always traffic jams. Well, sorry but I'm in a hurry. I'm leaving you. Hello, mom. - Hello Hi. - Hands off! Show some respect, my little plum. I just overtook a Lamborghini with my rotten Honda. Really? So what? You know who was at the wheel? Enrico Fontana. The last winner of the 24 hours of Le Mans? - In person. You should have invited him to dinner. - I wanted to but he couldn't keep up with me. "Terribile visu". Meaning I looked magnificent. Olivier? - Yes. You'll be dining alone. We're invited for diner at the President of the Bar's. Christine, I've left the telephone number in the notebook if someone wants to reach us.- Ok, madam. Cook a steak for Olivier. And keep that for tonight, it will be perfect. - As you wish. Dad, my Honda ran out of gas. I'm out of gas too. - Again? Yes. You owe me 400 francs for my first place in philosophy anyway. You already got them? - No, I didn't. You see: philosophy, first place. Thank you. - Are you ready? - Yes. See you tonight. - See you tonight. Serve me a glass of Coke. Jean-Pierre has finally made up his mind. He'll come at three in the afternoon. Really? I'm a little embarrassed all the same. Why? I thought you liked him very much. - I really said that? I don't even remember what he looks like. In any case, he's a good boy Don't traumatize him. Hey! I never traumatized anyone! You finally came. - Yep. - So, are you in shape? Come on. Upstairs. To the left. It's here. Hello! What a surprise! Hi. - Come in! I can't stay, I'm leaving you... - Where are you going? I have lots of things to do. See you at six at the Lampion's. I can go with you if you want. - Wouldn't you rather have a drink with me? Of course he would. Thank you. Sit down. He's handsome, huh? - Yep. I have the feeling there's three of us. Close your eyes and relax. I open with 5.000. - I pass. I follow with 20.000 - 30.000. Someone found some money in daddy's pocket. - You cave in? 25.000. - Mat. What did you have? - To know, you have to pay. - Four aces. Well, I owe you 100.000 - Me, 140. It's not my day. 200. - Here. Hi, guys! - Hi. What took you so long? - You should know. Since three o'clock... - It seems that I'm gifted. Pierre, one scotch. Look at the Lamborghini there. It's Fontana. Let's see him. What is he doing in a one-way street? - I don't know. Dumb cunt can't drive! Hey baby, it's a one-way street! You'll never make it like this. What should I do? - Keep your feet on the pedal. Try it. - I can't. Carry on. No, not like this. - It's a one-way street! Hold my moped. I'll do it, move along. Bravo! You're very kind. Without you, I was lost. This is my husband's car. I know, I met him this morning. - Really? I just took him to Orly. He's flying to Indianapolis? - Yes. He was rather worried knowing that I'll drive his car home. I think he was not completely wrong. That's it. You want me to take you home? Where do you live? - L'Ile Saint-Louis. I didn't know that your husband lived in Paris. - It's just a small apartment. We're seldom here. Jean-Pierre, take my Honda home. I'll take the path along the banks, it will take longer but we'll avoid the traffic jams. How long have you been driving? - Not very long. You're doing great. - I have a cousin, a racer, he taught me. Watch the road all the same. It must be wonderful to be married to a racing driver. You often go with him to the races? - At the beginning I accompanied him everywhere. Now, it's not so interesting. You know, after the competition, the drivers like to hang out together. You won't go to Indianapolis? - No. What's the matter? - Brace yourself, the police! You mean...you don't have your driving license? You know how fast you were driving? - No, I don't. It's your car? - No. Papers, please. Thank you. Mr. Enrico Fontana 12 Via Cabour, Milan. It's not him. Mr. Fontana is abroad these days. Mrs or Miss? - Miss. Miss Frederique Dampierre, 12 Via Cabour, Milan. Okay. Sorry, I'm not familiar with the rules of the road. I arrived recently in Paris. Well, you have a diplomatic passport but all the same, be careful. Thank you, officer. I have colleagues who won't be as kind next time. Miss. Handbrake. Are you angry with me? You know, I'm not married with Enrico but I consider him my husband. Don't look so glum. At your age, everybody does stupid things. Goodbye. - Goodbye. So you didn't drive her home? - Stop being dumb. Where is my Honda? Are you crazy? That would have taken up at least 3 hours to bring it back. Well, let's go find it then. Can you lend me your portable TV? - Why? You don't have TV at home? It's for Fontana's wife. So that she can watch Indianapolis. She doesn't have a TV? - Apparently. - It's annoying, I wanted to watch the race too. Don't you forget who lent you Christine? - Okay, okay. Good afternoon, madam. Miss Dampierre, please. In front of you. On the fifth floor. - Thank you. Good afternoon. - What a surprise! You told me you didn't have TV, so I brought you mine. The race starts at 8:30 pm on the first channel. It's so nice that you remembered. - Not at all. And I didn't want you to keep a bad impression of me. Come on in. To the right. Where shall I put it? Over there on the secretaire. But first remove your coat. Here, it's working fine. Here is the second channel and there's the first. All right. Would you like something to drink? Scotch? No, thank you. I completely stopped drinking. You used to drink a lot? - I had a period. I tried everything. Then I thought it was completely stupid. Orange juice then. - Yes. And after your degree in Philosophy? - I don't know yet what I'll do. I want to live a little before I decide. Do you think it's stupid? Not at all. On the contrary. Anyway, I would like a dynamic profession. Journalist for instance. But only if I'm among the top ten. And you? What do you do? Well, I used to be a journalist precisely. - Really? Yes. That's how I met Fontana 5 years ago. I went to interview him at the 12 hours of Sebring. It can't be! They sent you to Florida? No, I've always lived in the United States. My father is consul there. For what newspaper do you work? - I'm not working anymore. You know, when a woman's in love, only love matters. I agree. I have a good relationship with my parents. Especially since I've figured out their problem. Classic problem: growing old. Growing old must be depressing. Probably much more for a woman than for a man. Say, you're going to give me a complex with my 25 years! No, 25 is not old yet. And you wear them well. Where shall I return your TV? - Don't worry. I'll come back tomorrow. - Good. Goodbye. - Goodbye and thank you again. Fontana is third. - He has straightened out beautifully. I want to see Mireille Mathieu on Channel 2. - Are you crazy? There's a rugby game after that. Then I'll listen to her on Paris Inter. You know where's the caretaker please? - No, I don't know. Caretaker, please! Good afternoon, madam. - I'm coming! Madame Dampierre is here? - She's in her bathroom. I came to pick up my TV. - Yes, go on. Hello? Hello? I'd like you to be here... Yes, yes... I'm on my bed. I'm just out of the bath. My skin is so soft... Shut up, my love... I want to make love. Really? Me too. Enrico, shut up... Enough, I'm blushing... Oh no, I want it so much, I swear... No, carry on...I want to... I'm thinking about the phone operator, if she's listening to us... Goodbye, madam. - Monsieur. Like it? It cost me 10 francs at the supermarket. If you're interested, there is nothing underneath. - Not now. There's no one in the apartment. - Don't keep on! Come on. You will work better after love. So said Socrates. You're sure? - You said so. Look what I found. Keats. It's very sentimental. It's too easy. She'll think I'm a loser. Here, I found something from the 13th century. In Old English. It's perfect. Hello? Ha, it's you! I'm sorry I didn't see you when you came for your TV. I didn't want to bother you. - Not at all. If I dared... I want to ask you a favor. I have a hard time with an English paper. Could you help me with the translation? Of course. With great pleasure. I'm not busy now. It could be fun. Let's say at 5 in the afternoon? It's perfect. - Alright. - See you later. Thank you! It worked. - Bravo. Good afternoon. - Oh, it's you. Yes, you told me 5. I'm too early? - I said today? Yes. If you want, I'll come back tomorrow. No, tomorrow I'll probably be gone. Come in. Will you be gone long? - I don't know yet. Give me your paper. - Yes, here it is. How far have you translated? Up to there. - But it's very long! This is a very old English. Hello? Yes. Hello? M. Fontana. What? He already left? He didn't leave a message for Miss Dampierre? But this is impossible! No, I'll call again. Thank you. Don't keep on, please. I don't know why I agreed. I'm doing you a disservice. It will be better for you to work alone. Now, leave me alone! Go away... Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. You're passing by? - No, I came especially to see you. Your translation was difficult. It took me an hour. - No kidding! You did it? I owed you one. I was horrible with you the other day. It must be said that you called at a very bad time. Really? - Yes, I quarreled with Enrico on the phone. And he hung up on me. The usual love drama. Could you introduce me? Pleased to meet you. Another waffle? - Well... - Haven't you had enough already?- Let him eat. Waiter, please! - No, no, it's for me. You came with the Lamborghini? - No, by foot. I'll take you home with my Honda, if you want. - Double dare you! - You're on! Goodbye, Jean-Pierre. - Goodbye, madam. Goodbye. Thank you, Olivier. - Goodbye. You'll be in Paris for the holidays? - I wanted to go skiing but it's booked everywhere. Try Avoriaz, it's a new resort. Maybe they have some rooms left. You think so? - You could try. And you, where will you be at Easter? - I don't know yet. Happy holidays then. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon, madam. - I need a sweater. I need a white one. A little like this one. You can try anything you want. Look mom, it's too big. Hello. - Oh, hello! How are you? - I'm fine. And you? Try this one. - Madam. Miss Dampierre. My mother. Miss Dampierre helps me with my English. - Really? Starting tomorrow I won't be able to help you. I'm off to the mountains for a few days. So you're going to a winter resort finally? The agency called back, they found me a room in Avoriaz. - Really? What a coincidence! We'll be there during the Easter holidays. We have a flat there. Olivier loves the place. It's our third year there. Olivier! Hello! - Hello. I'm looking for a friend He's at the head of the train. Olivier, call me on the phone. I'll be at the hotel "Dromont". Olivier, move a little. You're inside my range. - Alright. Is there a single person? - Yes, here. Good afternoon, Olivier. - Good afternoon. How are you? - I'm fine. How lucky we are with this beautiful weather! - Sure. Are you having a good holiday? - Yes, and you? I don't know anyone here. I'm happy to see you. - Me too. What about the man who was with you at the station? - Who? I don't know him, I met him on the train. He suggested that we share a taxi. That's all. Really? Ready? - Ladies first. Only after you. You're a good skier. - Yes, but I'm not as fast as you. I'll go slower now. Look! There! He's so cute! Your straps are undone. Goodbye. - Goodbye. We could go dancing tonight? - Not tonight, I'm tired. I'll stay in my room. See you tomorrow then. - Okay. See you tomorrow. Goodbye. Goodbye. Don't be afraid. It's me, Olivier. What are you doing here? - I wanted to wish you a pleasant night. - Very funny. Come in, it's freezing. Since you're here...You'll accompany me. I wanted to have a drink. It's going to be difficult. - Why? Well... - Take it off. I have nothing underneath. You're all wet. Wait, I'll get you something. Here, put on this bathrobe. Oh, no, Olivier! - So what? I'm warming up. You don't want to warm up with me? - No way! Come. I won't touch you. I promise. You're afraid? - No, I'm not afraid. Then come. So, you're warmer? - Not really. I don't want you to spend the night with me. Five minutes more. Your mother has invited me for diner tomorrow. Did she tell you? I'd rather go out only with you. It would not be very convenient. No, Olivier... You're unbearable... Hello? - Miss Dampierre? It's me. - M. Fontana from New York. Go away, quick! Hello, Enrico? Yes, it's me. Get out of here! Hi Enrico, it's me. I couldn't reach you. Yes, yes. Through the door. I hear you very badly. Don't hang up. I called you several times at your hotel. They didn't tell you? You could have returned my calls at least! - I've been very busy, you know. Don't exaggerate, you could have left a message. - I tell you I've been very busy. Alright. When do you come back? - In two weeks, I think. What? No! I've had enough! I don't want to live like this anymore! - I'm sure you enjoy your holidays. I don't care about skiing. I want to be with you. Stop bitching! You know what it's like to work on a prototype. It's okay, don't scream. I know that it's for your job. But put yourself in my place. Being alone for 15 days... Do you miss me a little at least? You look pathetic. Your Italian deceives you. I'm sure he's with another girl. You want the truth? You're just a doormat! Damn! Olivier, you should ask Miss Dampier to dance. She's bored. No. - What's wrong with you? You asked me to invite her but you don't talk with her all evening. It's not polite. Come on, Olivier. My son doesn't dare to invite you even though he's dying to. Isn't it, Olivier? Mom, Miss Dampierre feels bad. I'll accompany her to her room. Alright. Excuse me, is Miss Dampierre gone? Yes, this morning, she took the 8 o'clock train. Going to college already? It's only 7:45. - I prefer to be there early. You didn't have breakfast? - No thanks, I'm not hungry. It's not reasonable, Olivier. I'm not asking you to speak about Montaigne but Descartes. Just tell me why Descartes called his theory "the comprehensive doubt"? Because it's the "Discourse on the Method". - No. Poncin. - Because it's a method. Good. - A method, a mean, but not an end. Excellent. For Descartes, doubt is not a complacent attitude, it's a method to get to the truth. Have you prepared the third versification as I asked you? Almost all of it. - Why almost? Because it is long and difficult. - No, it's neither long nor difficult. Do you have an opinion on this? - Yes. I think I agree with Fontenelle. - Me too. But can you quote him? - I think so. According to him, Descartes has made a precision instrument out of the human condition. - Excellent. Do you remember something else from Fontenelle? - No, only that sentence. But I find it great. - I agree with you, my boy. Good afternoon, madam. Can you give this to Miss Dampierre, please? Yes, of course. - Thank you. Miss Dampierre? - Yes. I was asked to give you this. - Thank you. Tell me that you missed me too. I was mad. I had decided to not see you again. You're still in love with him? You cheated on him before? Yes. Once, two years ago. He had became so unbearable. But it was a real disaster. And when I was back I was certain that I'd rather stay with him than.... Then you came. And that's it. It's five am, I'm in a hotel with you, and I've never felt so happy in my life. I love you! I'll sing that tune to my dad to teach him my bad grades! - Fall in love and you will feel on top. By the way, I'm having diner and working with you tonight. What if your mother calls? - Tell her that I went to the toilet. Christine. - Who is it? Let me in, it's Mr. Fremaux. Where is Olivier? - Well...he's at Jean-Pierre's. Jean-Pierre! You're doing your homework at this hour? - There's no rest for the brave. Weren't you supposed to work with Jean-Pierre? - We couldn't finish. Don't lie to me, you weren't with Jean-Pierre. - No, I wasn't. And where have you been? - You really want to know? Yes, absolutely. - I was with the woman I love and who loves me. Repeat. - I was with the woman I love and who loves me! You really think that you have enough time to study and fall in love at your age? Perfectly. I have never learned better. And anyway I'm not going to discuss it with you! I just came back to sleep here and make you happy. But now that you know, there's nothing holding me here! Leave him, not now. Who is it? - It's me. What happened? - My parents called to say they'll stay at friends in the country. So I came back. - Oh, my love, come. What is it? - Nothing. Stay in bed. I'll be right back. Hello? Enrico, what a pleasant surprise. Me, mad a you? Why? New York is a beautiful city and I understand that you want to stay there. Why am I laughing? It would be too long to explain...- It's him? Me? Not at all, I'm in love. With a young and charming boy. He hung up. You're sure you won't regret it? - Oh, no! I think I'm living again now that he knows. First of all, I have to leave. I'll rent my own apartment. Where you can come whenever you want. Then I'll go back to work. Are you happy? - Incredibly happy. Ah, It's you. Your father last night was furious. What happened? - He called at home. And then? - Well, I went to see Christine... What a fool you are! - They didn't yell at you too much? I ran away from home. - You're going to live with her? Are you crazy? I won't make a living from her. - Let's hurry! I'm not going. I have a meeting at 11. You'll say that I'm sick. Charles's awake, madam? - Yeah, you can go up. Who's there? - It's me, Olivier. Yes, come in. So? - I found something for you. Nothing special but you can make up to 400 bucks per night. - What is it? Record dealer at Montparnasse. - Excellent! Here's the address. It's exhausting, you know. You couldn't keep going. I won't be the first student who works at night. Don't worry. Thanks. You don't know how happy I am. Thank you! Frederique, it's me. Who's there? - It's me. Come in. I had a shock this morning when your parents told me that you were gone. They seemed very upset. You're packing? - Yes. Your dad thinks I'm completely immoral. You can sleep with me if you want. You know, two years ago I wanted to die. Just before arriving in Paris. I was madly in love with a guy. I saw him again last summer. To think that I turned on the gas for "that". Don't worry. Time heals everything. I don't agree. We'll see next year at the university. You're wrong. It concerns us as much as the other students. You know about the meeting tonight at Louis Le Grand? - Yes, we'll all be there. I gotta tell you something. Your friend wrote me and asked me to give you this. Tear it up. - What's wrong with you? I'm back home. From now on I only care about getting my high school diploma. All high schools will be in turmoil. - You should become a Jesuit. I want to talk to you. I have nothing to say to you. - Hey, come on. All right. Come into my car. Did you see Frederique again? - No. I won't see her anymore if it can make you happy. I thought your affair was serious. - I didn't care about her a single second. Don't try to bluff me. Where is she? What do you mean? - She's gone for two days. Don't pretend you don't know! She's gone? Yes. Why? I thought you were an item. You really think having sex together fixes everything? In the end, it's better that way. I am 40 years old and I want peace. I'm tired of playing the strong man. Frederique never understood that. Otherwise I would have dropped out the competition, married her and had children. But she wants to live passionately 24 hours a day. With you it will work. You are cute and pure. You believe in love. I understand why she fell in love with you. She said that to you? - She even yelled it at me, if that's what you want to hear. Now go away, I don't want to see you anymore! To get from point A to point B the arrow must first travel through the half of the segment A-B. But before that, it must travel through the half of this half and the half of this half... and so on ad infinitum. Thus, it'll never reach point B. This irritating argument was described by Zenon. Who can tell me what he wanted to prove with this law? Monsieur? - Yes. - Can I get out please? Yes, of course. - Who wants to answer? Poncin maybe? Hello, madam. Is Miss Dampierre living here? - Yes, she's in her room. Shall I call her? No, don't. Thanks. You did right to go back to your parents. They were probably very worried. A little, yes. You're back in school? You doing alright? - Yes. I'm okay. I cannot stay long, you know. - Why? We have a meeting at Louis Le Grand. - You have to go? Yes, absolutely. But if you want, I can come back later. Of course I want it. Don't be mad at me, try to understand. After what happened, it's normal if we're both a bit tense. Rushing on the bed and having sex... It cannot always fix things. Yes, I know. You didn't call Fontana? Why should I call him? Maybe he's suffering. You think so? Anyway, it's a good thing for him that he's not competing these days. You feel guilty about him? You shouldn't. I thought a lot about it. In the end, it's a good thing that it's over between me and Enrico. We will be much happier without each other. You would have married him, if he had proposed? Probably. But since he never asked. Why do you talk about him so much? You know what we're going to do tonight? We'll go and have dinner like lovers do. And we'll try not to be back too late. Okay? How long will this meeting take you? - An hour or two. Don't stay there overnight. Come back quickly... What's the matter? You're hiding something from me? You don't love me anymore? - Of course, I do. I think I never loved you so much. You can get in the booth, sir. Hello, M. Fontana? - Yes. It's Olivier Fermaux. I called you about Frederique. You've seen her? - Yes. I think she wants to see you but she doesn't dare to call you. She told you so? - No. But you should call her. - Give me her number. Do you have it? - Yes. Odeon, 98... Odeon 98 - 74. What did she tell you exactly? translation: aloysius70
