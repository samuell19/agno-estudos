It's been 30 years since the CPC ruled Mainland China in 1949. What have they done during this period? Everyone is most concerned about the 900 million peopleвЂ™s lifeвЂ¦ вЂ¦under the Communist system Hence we make this film particularly set in Mainland China Through this film, we take an objective attitude to reflect the reality These is no fiction or exaggeration After watching this filmвЂ¦ вЂ¦think if you could bear with this kind ofвЂ¦ вЂ¦life, system, and the Communism If you could not, please fight against this kind of regimen Comrade! Comrade... Why didn't you wait for me? Soon I stop, it stalls. I saw a rat Kill the rats, kill the America imperialism! Be Frank Who let it go on purpose? The rat is America imperialism. Are you afraid of this? No. Who's afraid? It ran over my feet. I failed to stamp it. Are you afraid of this? Otherwise, why not stamp it? When we were in northern Shan Shi I would even stamp snakes! That was being a great socialist fighter. Right It was you who didn't stamp it. Why did you speak up? Why did you admit? The rat ran under your feet Monstrous beast spoiler, stand forward! Beat the rat... Beat America Imperialism. No rats allowed In the socialist paradise Our hard-earned food Is our very lives If you eat it People will be hungry You're hateful As America Imperialism What? Calling you Me? Lo Ling Welcome...

Welcome... Carrying out the proletarian revolutionary mission He went to England Today He is well recognized over the world As a great scientist Welcome... To watch a scientist learning from the People That is your sacred work Thanks to the Party for this opportunity The Party does not know How deep your affection was I brought you back for the welcoming Only after going to see you personally I hope you can seize the chance Don't let the Party down! I understand This proves that your vows of loves In the past were worthless Maybe he wants to focus on work Not on love Maybe he has another girl Or... even a foreign evil love him. But that has nothing to do with you. Your job Is to watch him closely I never expected to see you so soon. They found out we used to be friends And sent me to be with you. With such careful arrangements I will have to work hard You've just returned You will be moved by many things. How is your father? He's OK. I want to see him. Is he still mad with me? He will be delighted. Really? Dad. I knew you come back two days ago Public Security arranged our meeting today Why are you living in such a place? I moved several times What's wrong with it? You're crying? No. I'm happy you're back. Move with me. Move? For Shen Yi-fu to see, he's back. How considerate. I used to be against you seeing him. Will he want to come? What are you doing? Give back my ancestral tablet. Give it to me What are you doing? Go away, open your eyes and look You want to rise in rebellion? Be reasonable Reason with Chairman Mao We're Chairman Mao's red Guards. Chairman Mao is our commander. A forward step for the Cultural Revolution. We'll sweep away the "four olds". Down with degenerates! Down with doctors! Change the name to "The East is Red" Did you hear me? Go! Where'd you come from? What is it? What's that you've got? This is imperialist stuff.

My elder brother The Vice President of the Science Academy They are from our school The group I lead The Tsinghua Revolutionary and Guards I'll talk to you later Her name is Kang Hsiao-Hsia My lover Out with the old! In with the new! Revolution is guiltless... Out with the old! In with the new! Revolution is guiltless... They won't come to our house, will they? Our house is not an attraction for they to visit Made up neatly everyday For foreigners to take photos The people are pitiful It's better than labor camp You won't go wrong following Communist Party Speak and Act as the Party wants If I'd know the rules I would not have fallen From a professor to a library janitor. I think the Communist party Is playing monkey games Unfortunately, I am the monkey This is not the time for angry talk Learn what you should say Lying for the Party is the smart thing to do. I dot it for your sake Things are different now When your father found My father is a Communist He wouldn't let me enter your house Now he's more progressive than I do. It's the re-education he received If I invite you to visit my parents At ShanShi at the past He will have kicked me in the past But now you're important to the Party For the construction of science.

That's the committee secretary's business I only do research If you volunteer the rooms Red Guards of Chingkanshan will take my side They will fight for me against other Red Guards. I don't care who you fight with. Just leave me out of it. You've got us into it already. You were in Kuomintang. We're part of the Black Five Classes I'm in the red guards to gain favor To help the family. I know what Chairman Mao wants to do. All we have to do is to act properly And we'll be in the Five Black classes Instead of Five Red classes I don't want to be stigmatized always. Eating this allocated food everyday Mother didn't eat it herself She left it for the rest of us That's why died of malnutrition Cheng-hsien! I won't stand it! I'll go fight Dad! Give it a try!

We are a research institution It shows how students Love socialism, and New China I know it's hard, but you can make difference... What are you talking about? Maybe... Education business The Guards from Chingkanshen... Want to live in the Science Academy Over 7 million red Guards are here. Can we handle all of them? Don't stop... These scientists have contribute a lot In Science, Education, and Economic Aspects They're leaders in the battle for science. I hope you can... I want my brother, Vice President Shen. The study session can't be disturbed. Ask him to come! What's wrong? What's wrong? He said he's Mr. Shen's brother. May I help you? Yes, if you're the Party Secretary When we left Chingkangshan They told us If we had any trouble, just look for you. What's your problem? We've been here 2 weeks We still have no place to sleep. I'm Party Secretary for the Academy We want rooms for the Academy Chou Ta-tung told me about you. He talked for us He's Chou Cheng Hsien's father. The whole family is in the Black Five. We can build the Science Academy, too Why do we have to go through Chou? You want to work with Black Five? Fellows from ChingKangshan! We're trying to help you But you can't tell Why do you hang up with them? Right... Crawl back to where you came from Follow me! Crawl back to where you came from Armed department, please. Mr. Wang? This is Lin Hsian-Tung. We have an emergency at the Academy Send 20 men over, hurry. Get back! Find the traitors! Who are you talking to? You... You are traitors Skin the Five Black alive! Let them through, and we check their blood! Stop! You want a rebellion? Without instructions from the management Nobody will get any. If you don't like it Go to Chiang Ching. Sorry to bother you. This morning There was a call They want me to convene the Academy's people About the Red Guards borrowing of rooms We're to have an examination While the capitalist roaders are working Against the Party and Chairman Mao... Today Little red soldiers from the country side Have stood up to show their royalty How can we Offend the kids from Chingkangshan? Let me explain. Is there a recorder? Here As soon as the trouble happened I knew They'd go to the Chief The Chief was firmly explained We should not support them Let's ask at the outset Who refused the Red Guards' requests? Whose influence occupies the Academy So that we're called regressive? Looking down on the red Guards Is looking down to Chiang Ching and Mao Chou Ta-tung refused them His son led a group of people To fight with the Red Guard Things would go wrong, if I were not there No... It's not me That's the truth Because you and your son Because you and your son Plotted to sabotage the Academy Chou Ta-tung's problems Are not your business You know little about The communists You should looks after your father He worked for Liu Shao Chi. Will he be involved? Mom You are awake. For dad Who can help? You've heard about it, too? I will visit Chairman Mao. How can you see him? Even Liu Shao-chi won't survive this time. Who else can we go to? Don't make a fuss We can't just wait for the axe to fall. Dad wore straw sandals with Chairman Mao. They had good connections It does not mean anything Lots of people wore straw sandals with Mao What shall we do? That's why I can't sleep No matter what Let your father decide. He will know what to do. What worries me is... Does he know what to do? As soon as we see them We'll tell them Liu Shao-chi is arrested That'll discourage them They know Liu has fallen They'll never admit They're his people They said they support Mao That's opposing the red flag with the red flag Outsiders don't know who's fighting who As long as we know This is war, not the Cultural Revolution There's no reason, just fight. Why are you holing gun? Chiang-fu To fight with Black Five people No... Chiang-fu Grab his gun Don't stop me, or I will shoot you Let go, I will put the trigger Mrs. Shen... Chiang-fu Chiang-fu Go... We will kill the Black Fives You call us Black Five? We don't like your looks We dislike yours even more Go... Where's the machine gun we borrowed? Its coming Here's Chiang-fu! Go... Go... Get them Hurry Stay where you are Make way Chian-fu's there. Let's save him Chiang-fu, hurry Out of the way, Crimson Guards Here, hurry You think the Chief and Mao Will know what happen today? So many people dead in vain When they are dying Will they ask why? Black Fives deserves to die Chou Cheng-hsien spared our lives He's coward You mean he dare not kill us? I wondered Would I spare his life? If I had the gun? He dare not kill us If you had the gun Will you let him go? Are you feeling grateful to him? Shall I carry you? There's an ambulance Chiang-fu left Where'd he go? Was he hurt? He was luckier than all of the others You're ignorant Getting into such an open battle You die, I live, and that's revolution You can't bargain Was Chiang-fu hurt? Hurt? I could have killed him. All this mad killing Is that what you want? That's what class revolution is. Since marrying to the Shen family I've seen you more than I've seen your brother He's devoted to revolution You are like a mother to me You take care of me all the time But you never listen. You never get married If I get married and have children They will threaten me with the family. If your brother knew about this He will shot Chiang-fu Did you find your younger brother? I heard a lot of students passed away For the power struggle of politicians It is nonsense Where's Chang? I sent him away He did not want to leave We cried together pitifully He said he has nowhere to go He wanted to see your father for the last time It's right to leave A neighborhood cadre might use him To accuse you of having and orderly And making personal use of productivity That will be a big crime In that case, your dad will be sent away He wanted to stay with your father And die in our home, if he had to. Hello, may I speak to Marshall? This is Shen Tao. How are you, sister? He went to Tangku? I just returned from Tachai. The Chairman said We are Liu's team He will stand against us So I want to talk to Marshall urgently How can I contact him? You don't know where he is? Right Father Where have you been? I've been to the hospital Chiang-fu shot mother Repeat after me! Louder My thinking has stayed in the past I've advocated the supremacy of science I despised Chairman Mao and the Party Hurry Chill Who's backing you up? That you dared to stand against us? Speak up Let him take a ride Are you going to tell us? Let me die Don't force me Say it What do you plan to do? Go up Act vicious but don't really beat him Only you can help him Out of my way If you try disrupt our struggle We will struggle you, too He is my father I can clear up his accounts Who do you think you are? Comrades Chou Ta-Tung is my father Let me purge him Let him model of justice by purging His own father Don't let him go easy He can't help his father go through this My name is Chou Chen-shen I organized the Crimson Guards At Tsinghua University I've put a wall between him and me Let me tell you How awful he is Good! He is not a scientist He's an agent from Kuomintang! He is innocent! Spoiler Struggle him to pieces He's dissatisfied to party and people The Academy is a place to hide Kick him out Make him parade in the street It's a conspiracy I'm the Party secretary's secretary This struggle session is a frame-up Chou never refused to led the rooms It's him! Lin Hsian Tung! Take her away It's him! Lin Hsian Tung! Seas are not as deep as Chairman's love As Chairman's love Chairman Mau, oh!

What if I have no sons and daughters? I won't let you be the Party's son. I looked over for you I thought of looking here You came for me? With so many things happen How are you? Mao says Hardship matures a man I feel bad for you That does not do any good The question is how to survive How to survive? Who knows your father and brother will sacrifice? There will be a price. Shen Chiang-fu is missing. Don't you see? Liu's man will never get through this He worth nothing Don't you see? You can't be Red Five If you count on Liu Only to be smart, and raise the red flag Can you make the table turns Follow me I will cook you something Look at you Are you still angry with me? Now you understand Why I did not kill you last time Such a great sacrifice... Such a long time Why talk about Personal feelings? Where are we going? My place Now, I have to keep going Wait and see I will drag Shen's father out I will shout, Shen Tao! You bastard of Liu Shao-chi! You know what that'll do for me? Watch and see I will catch him This is revolution! What you are you doing? Still thinking? Should you go to bed? Why don't you say something? She Tao, open the door Don't be silly Tell me Did you hear me? Open the door You put me to bed So you kill yourself? If you die like this I will hate you Don't forget, I just recovered I have no strength to break in If you go to Tanku to ask for help I can go with you Please open the door Shen Tao If you leave me I will kill myself here If you've been watching Shen Yi-fu You should have written down many things Did you read the report? It proves that You are fooling around This is a task You can't blame on me I want to know Where did you hear My father criticizing the Party? At your house On 6th of November After dinner He complained to Shen Yi-fu What about Tachai record? Shen Tao wanted me to be Yi-fu's home companion If you were I How'd you feel? You wanted everybody to congratulate you It shows The ugliness of capitalism Should not I write it down? Stop arguing The superiors wanted to check it out They're afraid Yi-fu might be disappointed to the Party Because of his father Honestly We need him We must find ways to keep him Go ahead Tell them my plan in the meeting Now you understand the situation Yi-fu had a bad change In his mind Unless you comfort him It'll be hard to ears his aversion to the Party You told me not to be serious to the relationship It's different now Check the records I will give you a chance to redeem yourself Find Chou Shu-li Warn her to cooperate with us. If you continue, she'll ruin herself. Chu Ming said you won't cooperate If you waste more time and offend him He will take vicious steps Did he ask you to threaten me? Do as the superiors want Get yourself out of here Confess that I kill my dad and little brother? Lower your voice It's already gotten to this state Can you do it? If some killed your father Will you tell everyone? You are the murderer? Forcing confessions will bring you grief. I hope you to live That's the way to protect you When your whole family is dead What's the use of protecting yourself? Is it helpful to stay here? Just confess what they want you to do They will let you go You may as well leave I will rather die I will wait for them to kill me Tell them Forgive me I can't see you This is a goodbye letter The Red Guards are chased to the countryside The seems to be sent to work But the fact is They want to prevent trouble If they don't go quietly The army will liquidate them I won't go to the country side I always see Mao as my mentor Today he said We are useless I refuse to give up I will clean the insult with my blood If they want me to work in the country I can't do it No matter who wins? I have one thing to ask Not to worry me Chiang-fu What are you doing here? It is morning Why didn't you wake me? You were sleeping sweetly Come on, stop When Mom and Dad come back We'll tell them we want to marry Their approval means nothing We need the Party's permission The superiors wanted me to get close to you But did not ask me to marry you They don't want science or family Neither do we? Let's go abroad and get married They won't let you go and won't let me go Listen Love is a burden Let's just stay where we are. What if you get pregnant? I will raise him Even if you were not with us. I will tell the baby You are his father What do you mean if I were not there Is the Public Security Bureau after me? Or is it because of dad's case? None to that Why then? You make love with me because I need it? Are you insulting yourself? Or insulting me? What are you talking about? Fine Let's not mention about marriage from now on I want to let you know I never expected you to be a one-night stand Tell your superiors I don't like casual sex I don't like their arrangement Let them struggle me Lo Ling I will not watch you now I would rather stay in the labor camp I don't want to see you anymore You... learn nothing You don't know how to stay alive If we don't take any action We will disappear, and wiped out I don't believe the superiors make such order It's simple The Liberation army does not like Red Guards They are jealous Mao said Only we are his true disciple's soldiers Don't you understand? What Shen Chiang-fu if saying is If we don't find some way To protect the fate of Red Guards Mao won't protect us If someone is lost or killed There must be a reason I will never believe Mao will give such order Mao Chiang Chairman Mao, I miss you Mau Chiang, sister Chiang-fu You lose This one doesn't count Give it to me Give you what? Money Take this... Be serious That's the way I am, so what? Don't forget who you're talking to is the hero of Korea war That's history I was a hero 15 years ago I am still a hero now People thought you were a hero Because you were afraid of the bombs You shot your own leg And were carried off the battlefield Did you think I didn't know? You insult our hero I will kill you You are in the army But you can't kill people as you wish I've kill more Red Guards than you do. I am a struggle expert I even have records of Shen Tao I can put him to death if I want to Who do you think you are? I am resting here I play poker with you to kill time After the storm pass I will not play cards with you For these years People accused the Party of using and ruining people We never made a single complaint No matter Chairman Mao or Liu We always follow the Party Why do they want to say? I am people from Liu? If they accuse me. Why not Hsu Hsiang-chien? What is getting off? He knew I went to Tangku to see him And he hid from me for 5 days Won't be afraid that I might report him? Your father and I Thought of going with explosive And die together when we see him I would have done that, if we had bombs It's too late I was stupid Why wasn't I clear minded? You want to be heard?
