TOEI COMPANY, LTD. Presents BE BOP HIGH SCHOOL PART 2 Hey lad, go to the left and stop. This is a one way street. Can't you see this badge? Don't take Joto High lightly. I'm sorry. Did that wake you up? Will you go on your hands and knees, lad? Wait a sec. Hey, get serious! Don't take me lightly! Damn you! I'll get you next time! In your dreams, lad! Hi-ro-shi! Isn't it the guy with a scar here? He suddenly whacked me from behind. They outnumbered me. Still, how pathetic! Oh, shut up! I told you, they attacked from behind. Stop making excuses! Damn you! I can get you first! There. Just watch from here. OK, good luck, Hiroshi. Hey! Hey... Hey... Hey... How pathetic! Lewd! If you want to touch our bodies, just say so! What stupid faces! We didn't do anything... We just bumped into you. Now, now! Bitches! What a way to talk to your seniors! Keep that up, and I'll touch your breasts! I'll touch their belly buttons. I'll lick their feet! Oh, get serious! Miss, what's the matter? If they're picking on you, we can help you. This is our school's problem. Please stay out of it. Are you all with Aitoku? Just get lost, will you? Well, fine! Big Brother! Thanks. So you know each other? Are you here to get beaten with your buddies? Hey, hey, hey! Who do you think you are talking to? They are the notorious Kato Hiroshi and Nakama Toru of Aitoku! How lucky! You've just made my day. Was it Kato or Nakama who got beaten by me? Don't move! You'll get hurt. You'll really get hurt. The one who beat you up is Kato. The next time, you'll be beaten by Nakama. Remember that. I'm sorry. Hiroshi! Who will get beaten by me the next time? Get real! You can never beat my big brothers... Hey, Big Brother! You can sure eat. Ever heard of dieting? Hiroshi! Toru! Jump on quickly! Big Brother! Wait for me! What? There's a fight! Let's go! I need to eat another three orders, or it won't be free. You guys got money? Welcome back. Junko! Did you come all this way to get me? I didn't make a special trip... I was in the area. Didn't you let those two know? I was going to surprise them. Kyoko! - What are you doing here? - Did you come back? Yes, I transferred... I'll be in Class 2-F at Aitoku from tomorrow. Really? Junko, why didn't you tell us? Do you have time for this anyway? Big Brother! We've got some business to tend to... Wait 15 minutes... If you don't, you'll get a letter of bad news. Toru! Hiroshi! Are you two fighting again? Don't fight! You haven't changed at all, have you? Yes. Giving us trouble! It's payback time! My, you're coming out strong! Just tum around! You're going to get it! Stop fighting! Slop! Two against two! Joto isn't just a gathering of hoodlums! Did you lose? No, we got interference. Where are those two? In that truck with the strange design. Is that it? They're inside! Stop! Slop! It's about time... ...you die! Toru! Big Brother! Big Brother! Damn! It won't open! Hiroshi, get them to help! Hey! Damn, they're out cold. Why'd you use so much strength on them? Shut up! You should talk! Help! Help! Come down, too! We're ready for you! Are their heads made of muscles, too? They're awesome. Help! Please help us! Toru! Hiroshi! Kyoko! I thought you were too busy fighting, and you forgot about me... - Don't be stupid. - How could we forget? Here. Welcome back, Kyoko. I'm back. What happened? Who beat you up? Teru! Bara-senso (wars of the roses)... After the hundred year war with France... there was a battle in the defeated England between the white and red roses... But we are not talking about a flower shop here. CUTE! Kato! Nakama! Are you listening up? Yes! Fighting over the rulership... They were called the red rose and white rose armies. What are you thinking of? You should wipe your dirty drool. What! Idiot! Stop it, both of you! Please die! Hiroshi! Toru! Go and cool your heads at the rooftop! Understand? Hey, it's class time! Go back to class! What? You should talk. What! Not everyone is scared of you guys! We'll make you cough up blood. Stay away from the face... aim for the body. Wow, how scary. Mischievous. Just get them! Just get them? The way they respond is again scary. Damn! I'll kill you! Go ahead and kill me. Do you want to be laughed at again? Let's withdraw for now. Let's go! They withdrew. I don't understand gals these days. Nakama! Kato! You guys, again? What is it now? You can only talk big now. Who do you think she is? She's the 13th female boss, Mammoth Tae. Mammoth Tae? Cool! Is she lacking femininity? So what! I have to hand it to your parents. No femininity at all. I won't forgive you! Boss, how shall we make them pay? - Boss? - Seriously? You really want to get it, don't you? You really want to get it, don't you? Step aside... I'll take over from here. Stop acting tough! Remove your mask and sunglasses! Are you afraid to show your ugly face? What! Prove us wrong by showing us your face! Sure! I'll show you! Well? Do I look ugly? You're cute! What? Why are you acting bad when you're cute? I know someone who'd fall for you at first sight. Shall we introduce you to him? What kind of guy is he? If you're lying just to get out of trouble now, I'll make one of you my boyfriend. I'll be waiting at the new shop by the station at 8. If you don't bring the guy with you... Boss! Ouch... He's coming, isn't he? Don't worry. Someone's having a miai (arranged meeting)? Only the guy doesn't know. The poor fellow. He's here. Big Brother. If it's him, you're dead. It's the guy in the back. Senior, what's up? A strange girl is giving me trouble. Will you give it to her? That awkward looking gal there? Are you the one? Yes. Tae, isn't he handsome? Have a nice miai with her! What? Are you being stupid again? Tae-chan! Kin-chan! Kintaro, I wish you happiness! Hey! Kin-chan... They're cruel. Welcome. Joto is just a gathering of hoodlums. They're all show. They can't even fight decently. They hang out in groups and have no guts. Exactly. In short, they are worthless half-asses. Joto is just a gathering of hoodlums? You've got the nerve! That was just... Shall we make it so that you can't talk big again? Stop it! Please! Please don't! Senior! Did those Aitoku guys pee in their pants? Teru, you're dangerous. Will you show more guts? Stop getting beaten by Nakama and Kato. We plan to get them someday. I don't understand those two. Don't know if they're joking around or crazy. Nakama': nickname in middle school was... Mad Dog Disease. You know him? He makes you want to kill him. I'll catch him off guard one day. Hello. We're intruding. If you've got a gripe, come out with it! Stop wasting your time on the small fries. How pathetic! Teru, you won't tum into anything big. Nobody thinks anything of you. Toshimitsu is different. He's like a monster. He's still human! Stop doing petty things. Be a big man! Aren't you my son? Show some guts! I'll show you! I'll do something big! Don't mess with me! He's reckless. He's crazy. I don't ever want to mess with him. I can't believe there are any gutsy guys at Joto. Damn you! Hiroshi! So your life was saved. You should be grateful to me. That's Yamada Toshimitsu of Joto High. What about it? He's got guts. So do we. He's of a different dimension from you. If I were you, I would never fight Yamada. If you do, you'd only feel miserable. Just heed my warning. Yes. Good. You're lucky to have a good police officer like me. If he doesn't win, he'll flunk P.E. We'll make him win for sure, don't worry. - How troublesome - Look who he's up against. Why, it's Tae-chan. What's with her? I'm counting on you. What are you laughing at, bitch! Stop it! But... Are you the boss of Tachibana? Kato and Nakama of Aitoku are here. What! Come forward! Shimoyama, kill that pig and feed it to them! Kin, beat that idiot and feed it to the octopus! We'll kill you! Quiet down! What do you take judo for, anyway! What! What's your problem? Nothing. Please start. Kill him! If you lose, you'll get it! This is judo! Die! I'll kill you! One point for him! Give him the victory! Damn you! Damn it! Die! A love letter from Kikunaga? Show it to us already. It doesn't concern you. Just go home already. Is it a love premonition? Is that why you want to be alone? What are you doing? Hiroshi! Give it back! To think it was love at first sight for you, too. I couldn't believe it when I got the letter. I thought I would never fall in love... I'm losing confidence. I think I can become submissive, thanks to you. Can I call you Kiku-rin? Stop it. Why not? Okay? Kiku-rin. What is it? Call me Jun-rin. No. It's embarrassing. Please. Just one time. Please? How can I say no? Just once then. Jun-rin... You lady killer! Jun-rin? Hah! Idiot! Don't get mad. Forgive us, Kiku-rin. I'll kill all of you! Kiku-rin, aren't they your friends? Are they monkeys? What happened to you? It's the Joto guys! Slop! Hand it over! I'm Teru! If you've got a gripe, come to Joto! What's with you guys!? They're scared of the Joto guys. Those guys really got it from them. Hiroshi and Toru, will you be okay? Stupid. They're nothing to be scared of. But... most of their student body are delinquents. They're all show. That's why you're no good. Damn you. Hey, can get a light? What? A light. Who are you? Acting big. Middle schoolers should go home and sleep. You're despicable. Who do you think I am? Play your games elsewhere. Damn you! What's wrong, Shoko? He treated me like a fool. We'll take care of him. Hey! We're with Joto. Hand over your pants! You think you can scare me by saying that? Which middle school are you from? Don't act tough, you little brats! What! You want to get hurt? If you take out dangerous toys like this... this can happen to you. I'm son-y! Don't ever show your face again! I'm going to become his girlfriend! What did you get beaten up tor anyway? How cruel. Hey": Yes? Toru, you have a visitor! Hi there! Who is she? I'm Shoko, Toru's girl. Don't be stupid! Don't be shy. But that's what I love about you. Being the unpopular guy that you are, you finally settled for a middle schooler! She's cute. Introduce somebody to me, too. Shut up! I wouldn't go for a kid like her! Toru, I'm glad you found a cute girlfriend. Hiroshi, didn't you want one, too? I hope it works out for you, too. Kyoko! I was kidding! Unlike Toru, I am devoted to you, alone! Wait up! Hey, stop joking around! Shut up. You went after a middle school girl. Just leave Kyoto to me and find happiness with the kid. That's right, Toru! Ignore that cocky girl! Shut up. Do you have something against me? Get lost! Is that anything to say to an innocent girl? I'll hang myself! Go right ahead! Like I really care! Toru, that's going too far, isn't it? I'm going to kill myself! See? She wouldn't die. Kids these days die easily. Don't take me lightly, I'm the demon princess. She's scary. Toru is running away everyday, isn't he? He was never popular with girls, so he doesn't know what to do, and is at a complete loss... How pathetic... she's only a kid. Why, it's Kato! Who are you, again? Don't play dumb! We were classmates in middle school. Your peers are sure taking you lightly, Hiroshi. Kato, you haven't forgotten me, have you? Are you Tsubota? Sarukichi? Shut up! Thanks to that funny nickname, do you know how much you've embarrassed me? I'm glad I ran into you. Let's settle the score. You're talking big now. You must've gone up the ranks, I see. I was reborn at Joto. I'm not like before. Oh? Joto, huh? You're all show, all right. Don't take us lightly! Die! Let go of me! After we chased him down, he peed in his pants. We'll have to throw away his pants. We've got zero today. What are you laughing at? You sure have energy. Hello, Toshimitsu. Teru, you seem fired up these days. Of course. I'm a man of action. Joto isn't just a gathering of hoodlums. I won't let anyone say that again. How mighty. You're getting a name now. Stop going after the small ones, and catch a big one. That's my every intent. Work hard at it. You guys, too. Did you hear? He treats us like small fries. We're the ones who are working hard. He does nothing and just watches from the side. I guess a big fish is different, huh? We found Nakama of Aitoku. Teru! It's been a long time, Nakama. Yeah. Did you like the movie? Did you come here just to ask that? It's payback time. We'll see about that. Acting cool, as usual. Well, boss? What! Hey! Stay still! Take off his pants! How pathetic. Will you look sharp? You'll get it later for doing this to me! You're hurt in the head and are tied up... What can you do? Don't act tough! I'll lose for today. Do what you want. But I can't wait to see you the next time. Just remember, I'll get every one of you! You're tough as ever! Look at his legs. He has scars on them. That's where I stabbed him in middle school. But he took away my knife after that. And he pinned me to the floor. I've got more guts now. Shall we go for another round? Please give me a break! Huh? What did you say? I'm hard of hearing. I can't hear you. Say it loudly and politely, so that I can hear you! Okay! Please give me a break! If you walk around with a big attitude again, I'm going to kill you! He's no mad dog. He's no match against you. How gutless... Nakama, what time is it now? I'm sorry. How, pathetic. After you said Joto guys are gutless. That's not funny at all. Are you getting revenge? I'll go with you. What? Are you gutless now? How pathetic. This is too much. How awful! Go home. I'll keep you company. You're a nice guy. What's wrong? You're not yourself. Want to eat something? I won at pachinko. I'll treat you. Why, if it isn't Nakama! You look cute like that. I'm wearing your pants. It smells like urine. It smells, doesn't it? It sure smells! Well it is the pants of that gutless guy! That's enough! What's with you? If you take Big Brother lightly... You won't get away with it! Stupid! Let it go! Nakama, you can't control your own guys? Shall I discipline him in your place? All right, I'll talk to him. Isn't that enough? Go. Toru! All right. We're with women today. Just keep behaving like that. I'll return your pants someday. Shave your head bald and beg for it. I'll kill them someday. Don't just mouth off. I didn't think you were like that. Damn you! I know I have no right to say this, but... But... but...! I didn't want to see you like that. Nobuo! Even the dog is taking me lightly. Are you Kato? We met before. So what about it? Is the boss here personally? What a big crowd for me! I'm honored! You won't be able to talk! I'm settling the score. Don't worry, it's just me. Stop acting cool! Not bad. Too bad Takemitsu wasn't your opponent. Cut out the nonsense. It's not over yet. Another blow... and your vitals will be damaged. It's not over yet. I'll make it so that you'll never want to fight again. Please give me a break! Take his pants! Take it off! This ends the hunt! Toshimitsu! Stop while you're ahead. What a pair. They've both turned gutless. Toru isn't like that. He'll surely kill those Joto guys someday. So will Hiroshi. I wonder about that. Once you fall, you'll keep falling continuously. Don't say that, Junko! Why do you say that? - Is it wrong? - Yes, it's wrong! Toru isn't going downhill. Stop harping about Toru! Go home and lick your candy, Kiddo. Candy? Toru and Hiroshi aren't yakuza. They're students. What's wrong with being ordinary students? They're ordinary? You were trying to tum them into ordinary boys. Were you thinking of something that stupid? Don't interfere. Go home and have your kiddy lunch. Kiddy lunch? Hey! What is it? Go home! All right. Are you happy they turned ordinary? Well, if anything, they are below ordinary. They're just depressed now, that's all. So what if they lost in a fight? It's silly to fight, anyway. It's stupid to dwell over winning and losing. What was that for? To smart people, it may seem silly. But the stupid ones have to live their best. Everyone is desperate! Just because you are a bit smart, don't let it get to your head, Missy. If that's how you think, stay away from them. You'll just ruin them. I don't get what you are saying. Poor thing... Not you, but them! I got wet... because I forgot my umbrella. I'm going to take shelter here till it stops. Want to play? I'm good. What's wrong? You're both acting strange. How silly, it's just a fight that you lost. Quiet! We're in no mood to talk. Leave us alone! What? Don't look at me like that. I hate it! You're acting like hooligans! Yeah, we're hooligans! Give us a break. Did you only realize that now? Toru! Hiroshi! Wait! I'm sorry... I said, I'm son?! Can't you hear me? Toru! Hiroshi! Please don't go away. I'm sorry... Mr. Arata! Hello. You look gutless. Boss! Kaneko! Nobuo! Gin! Jun! Let's go! Not today... got the runs. Gutless! Kin! Shinpei! Jun! Let's go on a pants hunt! Yeah, Boss! What's going on? We're going on a pants hunt from now! Wait up! We're taking your pants! Take it off, idiot! Don't take us lightly! You won't got away with doing this to Joto! Shut up! Who do you think he is? He's Aitoku's boss, Mr. Kaozaki Futoshi! There are a lot of guys who are stronger and more dangerous than you. If you let that get you down every single time, you'll never get out of the slump. Do you remember what was said to Matsukata? The one who targets... is stronger than the targeted. Wait up! Stop right there! Teru, you're awfully spirited! Don't act tough with me! You talk like your dad! Stop acting up, by doing stupid things in a group! Don't worry, it'll end pretty soon. You're truly despicable! He called to say he'll be gone for a while. He's always like that. Just when I'm about to give up... He comes back out of the blue. That's the kind of troublesome guy he is. Did he say where he was going? He just told us to go home ahead of him... I see. Is there a girl you like? Yes... Shall I read your palm for you? Take out your hands. Shall we sing a song? Will you dance? Or it's too sad, isn't it? Come on! Are you Izumi Kyoko? Yes? I'm Fujimoto, a friend of Nakama and Kato. They are Harada and Ishikawa. Hello. You're Toru's friends? You've got a call... from a girl named Izumi. What? Kyoko? Toru? I searched all over for you. I'm with your friend, Fujimoto Teruo, now. What? They want to apologize to you so don't fight, and resolve it amicably. Are you listening? The place? A drive-in called Poseidon by the beach. We'll be waiting with Izumi. We'll exchange your pants with what Kaozaki took... Give my regards to Kato as well. Why are there so many guys for an amicable talk? I don't know. Ask him. A boss should act bold like a boss should be. I'm the one who started the pants hunt. It's only proper that I'm the one who ends it. What are you talking about? I don't get it. You said you wanted to apologize. You said you'd talk things out. What do you plan to do to Toru and Hiroshi? They're here! Nakama! Kato! The gutless pair are here together! Toru! Hiroshi! Missy, your job is over. Watch quietly from the other side. You tricked me! Hey! Tsubota, treat this strong-willed girl to curry. Don't do anything, Kyoko. You don't honestly think we're going to talk it over! Put them down gently! They're the pants for our school uniform. Here are your lousy pants. Nakama, Kato, go and pick them up. Will you hurry it up, idiots! Hop it! Stop being mean! Just stay there quietly! Good. Now, sit down. What cute gutless dogs. Will you be for mercy? Your juniors gave us a lot of trouble. But it's no use picking on the puppy dogs. So we'll have the two of you take responsibility. How do you plan to take responsibility? Damn you! He wants to prove himself, so just let him! Toshimitsu, you promised not to interfere. They're taking you lightly. Are you using us as your tools for a fight? We can't take that! How about that! Shut up! Kyoko! Go in the bathroom and lock the door! Don't come out until we come for you! How dare you! You plan to die here? We'll show you our stuff! All of you, go to hell together! Damn! Teru, let's see what you can do! Hello? Is this the police? What happened? Nakama and Kato...! Take that! I dare you to go inside! Damn kid! He's got guts! Or he's just stupid. Take that! Don't run away! In your dreams! Screw you! Let me go! Come! I'll kill you! Come at me! Nakama! Come out! You're not getting away! What a fool! I'm crazy to begin with... You'd better kill me now, for who knows what I'll do. Die! I can still go on... Teru! Teru! Teru, where are you? Nakama! From here, it's an adults' fight. I'll kill you and serve time. Think you can scare me with that? Teru! You saved me earlier... Thanks. Nakama! Come at me! What's wrong, Teru? Are you scared, alone? Come! Damn you! It's a perfect grave for you! Die! I won! I won! Come at me! I'm ready! Big Brother! Toru! Hiroshi! Kyoko! I'm sorry about this... So how does it tum out like this? They're unbelievable! What I find unbelievable is, why do they like an ordinary girl that just holds them back? She's ordinary, but... not a bad girl. She seriously worries about those hopeless guys... they aren't many like her around. Somewhere in her heart, she must be a hooligan. I don't understand older women. Ouch! Will someone read the next part? Izumi? Izumi Kyoko! No... don't fight! Toru! Hiroshi! They're not fighting... They are tardy. If you keep going late, you'll have to repeat... You should talk. Hey! Someone said, "hey." What do we do? I don't want to fight for a while. Shall we ignore him? Kato! Nakama! What! You guys look terrible. Hello. Didn't Toshimitsu get to you? You end up like that, for not heeding my advice. Listen. Take this as a lesson and behave! We did it! English Subtitle By NIPPON GOLDEN NETWORK THE END
