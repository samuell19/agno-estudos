Mouse: Yeah!Mouse: Yeah! Yeah! What a party animal. Do we have any snacks? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. It's over there on the mousetrap. Pass the cheese. Oh, boy. What a party. Whoopee! What a party. [Up-tempo Latin music plays] What a party. You guys are real party animals. Sure. I'm the happiest mouse in the world. I'm the happiest mouse in mousedale. This is the best part. Hoo! Whoopee! [Laughs] [Man snoring] So, they're having a little party, and they didn't invite me! Hmph! Why, those disgusterous little squeakers. Mouse: Oh, no! It's naughty noodles! Noodles the cat is sucking up our party with his kicksydumper gizzardgulper. All: A kicksydumper gizzardgulper?! Please, Mr. Noodles, don't ruin my party. Mr. Noodles: Tell it to the marines, kid! [Fanfare plays] Ah, what's this?! Aah! Hidey-hidey-ho! It's off to help my friends I go! [Cheering] Stop your squeaking, you delumptuous little bellybopper. Ha ha ha! Stop! Whoopee! My hero! Hoo-hoo! Man: We came here when I was a kid. That's why it looks so old. Well, here we are. Yeah, I hope someone else is. Yoo-hoo! Boy: Hey, "amazing Amos" is on. It looks just the same. Hello! Anyone here?! [Bell dings] Ah, signs of life. You disgusterous rodent. Uh, h-hello. Oh, yeah? Try this on for size! Hidey-hidey-ho! Ooh, just at the good part. Rats! Welcome to the mountain view inn. Thanks. We'd like a room for the night. Oh, no trouble at all. Just let me get right through my door here. Now, here's the register. If you will, please, just sign...Right there. [Bugle plays "taps"]What's that noise? Oh, that's the bugler over at happy acres camp playing "taps." [Sighs] Sounds like someone died. Happy acres--good name for a pet cemetery. Garf. Sweetheart, what's our license plate number? Well, are you off to summer camp? Yeah. Ooh, you're gonna have a lot of fun there. That's what they tell me. Garf, not this again. Case of the reluctant camper. Mm-hmm. I've seen it before. Room 12. Louise did get that place cleaned, didn't she? You know, you've managed to keep all the old charm here. Oh, well, we try very hard. Can I take something? Oh, thanks, thanks. Thank you. Come on, now. I'll show you to your room. I seem to remember you from when I was here before. Have a nice day, folks. Garf, don't worry. It's not gonna be so bad. Night. Well, young fella, what'll it be for breakfast-- apple pie or chocolate cake? Got any peanut butter cookies? Peanut butter! Mm-mmm! [Mouse imitates engine revving] [Gasps] Ohh! My motorcycle! Whee! Yay! Get off! You'll hurt yourself. But I want to ride it! No! It's not a toy. You won't share because you're selfish. I'm not selfish. I'm going to tell uncle Lester! Yeah! We're telling! Ah, go ahead. Go tell uncle Lester. See if I care. [Imitating engine turning over] [Imitating tires screeching] Very reckless. Very. [Imitating tires screeching] Reckless mouse. Stop! I want to have a talk with you! Ohh! Ohh! Gotcha! Uncle Lester! Don't "uncle Lester" me, Ralph! Everybody's complaining about you and tha-a-a-t motorcycle! He's selfish! Yeah! He never gives US rides on his motorcycle! Ralph, give them rides. [Cheering] But you-- now! Or else! Whoopee! No, no, I want to ride first! [Weakly imitates engine revving] All: Faster, faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! I thought I gave you a ride. Oh, no, not me. But this time make it faster! What?! You've had more than one ride, haven't you? You want faster? You'll get faster. [Imitating engine turning over] [Crash] [Crying] Are you all right? Ralph, you're grounded. But--but I did what you said. You did what I said, but I didn't say to do what you did. Park that motorcycle and don't let me catch you riding it again! But-- now! But...if I can't ride my motorcycle here, I'll--I'll--I'll ride it somewhere else! I'm leaving! Come back here, young mouse. I told you not to ride it again! You're being disobedient, Ralph! I stayed here with my parents. It was almost 26 years ago. Were you on your way to happy acres camp, too? Oh, yes. I had a great time. This place hasn't changed a bit. Be sure you brush your teeth every day at camp. Sure, mom. Did you hear that strange noise in the hall last night? I was so tired, I went right to sleep. It sounded like-- it sounded like a tiny lawn mower. [Imitating engine revving] Lawn mower in the hallway? Eh! You and your imagination. No, it was real! I was wide awake! Ok, it's about time to get to camp. Aw, dad, do I really have to go to this dumb old camp just because you went there a zillion years ago? Garf, I don't want to hear any more "aw, dad"s or "do I really?"S. I think you're gonna like this camp. I hope so. All right, Garfield, forward march. Bye. Bye. Thanks a lot. I put your bag in the car. I'm gonna get a bite, Matt. [Clock chiming] Oh! No one understands me! They'll be sorry. They're going to miss me when I'm gone. Another word for "road"... Rhymes with "blue Jay." I'm running away. Huh?! What?! I'm running away on my motorcycle. How come--not enough peanut butter? Ohh! I'm just tired of being bossed around. Well, be careful. It's a wild world out there on your own with no one to help you. I don't need any help. I can handle anything. Oh. Well, then, the best of luck to you. Um...uh... I was wondering if you'd open the door for me. Well, now... If I opened the door for you, I would be helping you, and you said you didn't need any help. But--but how do I get my motorcycle out? Mnh-mnh. Ok. All right. I'm on my own. Hmpf! [Grunting] Ohh! Ugh! Ha ha! [Imitating engine revving] Hey, Ralph, you forgot to close the door!

Woman: Oh, you got something! [Ralph snoring] Well, well. What have we here? [Laughs] Now, watch carefully. This is the way to handle a measly mouse. Merton, pay attention. Now, watch this. [Meows]Aah! [Groans] [Meows] The mousie is now trying to imitate a dead mouse, but I can feel his little heart beating. Merton, what did I just say? You said, uh... You were gonna imitate a dead mouse. Go ahead. I want to see that, daddy. Never, never let a mouse make a fool of you. I will now demonstrate the "scoop, toss, and gobble" technique. Observe. I'm watching, daddy. [Growls] He-e-e-e-lp! He-e-e-e-lp! Got him! Oh, yay, garf! What kind of butterfly did you get? It's a mouse. A moth? No, a mouse. A mouse?Yeah, I rescued him from that cat over there. Well...[chuckles] That is happy acres' first flying mouse. Let's, uh--let's go turn him loose somewhere where catso can't reach him. Well, I'd like to keep him. Oh, garf, he really should go free. Please? He'll be my friend. Well, ok. Let's go find a spot for him in the nature corner. I bet that's a real special mouse. Hey, garf caught something! It's a mouse! Don't anybody touch him! Don't touch him! No touching! I feel him quivering. Oh, he's not quivering. Yes, he is. Woman: We built this last year for an injured squirrel, but I think he'll be real happy in it. Girl: He's so cute. Oh, honey, don't do that with the paint. Let's feed him. I'd be glad to feed him whenever I feed chum. Thanks, but if I feed him, then you feed him, then she feeds him, then everyone in camp feeds him, he'll explode! So, fine! We were just trying to help. Who would want to feed your dumb mouse anyway? He's not dumb. He's not as smart as a hamster. If that's how garf wants it, let him do it. [Bell rings]Oh, ok, everybody. That's apaches to the riding stables, cherokees to the archery range... And you to the shower. Bye, mouse. [Grunting] Let me out of here! I want out! What's all this confounded racket? Can't a hamster get any peace around here? Take it easy, pal! Pipe down! Wowie! [Laughs] What kind of mouse are you? Me? A mouse?! I'm a golden hamster-- cricetus cricetus, to be precise. Ha! What's to eat around here? Pellets--green pellets. Pellets? What are pellets? [Chuckles] You'll find out. My name's Ralph. What's yours? Ralph, nice to meet you. They call me "chum."

[Pellets clattering] What's the matter? Don't you like pellets? I'll bring you something else next time. Hey, how about some peanut butter? Mmm! [Bugle plays "reveille" off-key] Ok? Karen, you've been scratching all day. My whole arm itches. Uh-oh. Looks like poison oak. You better go and let the nurse put something on it. Come on. Stop scratching. Oh, it itches. Ohh. [Bell rings]Oh, ok, everybody-- swimtime! All: Yay! Hey, mousie. I have some sunflower seeds for you... And...a peanut butter sandwich. Wow! Garf, why are you still in here? I'm just feeding my mouse. You're not supposed to be in here without a counselor. So, uh...Next time, feed your mouse during nature hour. My mouse doesn't like schedules, and neither do I. You know, garf, you really need to loosen up. I think you'd have a whole lot more fun if you just joined the group in activities. [Scoffs] My mouse and I have our own group, thank you. Fine. But right now it's swimtime, and I bet that mouse is not interested in a swim, hmm? Come on. I want you to go out and join the other kids. Oh, come on. Try. Just go out and try to have some fun! [Sarcastically] Some fun. Whoa. Hi, aunt Jill. Are you going for a swim, too? [Laughing] Hey, hey! Yah! Ooh. Aah. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Hey, merton, look. A mouse. A measly mouse. He's playing dead.

That's my motorcycle! Look what he's doing! Oh, he'll ruin it! Ohh! Ohh! I'll never get back home. Relax. Enjoy yourself. You've got it good here. This cage is awful! Ohh! Ugh! Oh, I had it better at the hotel. Oh. Daddy, daddy, look! I caught a measly mouse. Merton. It's playing dead, but I can feel its heart beating, just like you taught me. That little mouse made a big fool of you! This is a fake mouse. But, daddy-- never mind. I'll fix the real mouse... Tonight. [Purrs] [Thunder crashes] Ralph. Wake up. I hear catso. [Yawns] Nah, chum. It's just thunder. [Sniffs] Ralph, I smell cat fur. [Sniffs] Nah. Come on, chum. Go to sleep. R-r-r-Ralph, I see catso! There's nothing there. [Gasps] [Whimpering] What's wrong, mouse? Cat got your tongue? [Meows] There he is! [Meows] [Ralph chattering, catso meowing] Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Ooh, ooh. Where's the mousie? Aah! There's the mousie! Aah! Ohh! Aah! Eeh! Ahh! Now I'm mad. [Meows] Is he here? No. Is he there? No. He must be here. Where is he? Hoo-hoo!there he is. [Meows] Aah! [Meows] [Meows] Aah! Aah! End of the road, mousemeat. What happened? Catso, get out. Get out! [Meows] My mouse. Oh, no. Mousky, where are you? Yoo-hoo! I'm over here. Over where? Who said that? Ralph. Ralph who? Ralph the mouse. Hi, garf. I'm ok. Is this some sort of trick? [Laughs] No trick. But you're a mouse. Mice can't talk. We're talking, aren't we? Mice aren't dummies. Sorry. You've got something of mine in your pocket. What? In your pocket-- my motorcycle. It's yours? Yep. How did you get a motorcycle? A boy gave it to me. Hoo-hoo! Watch. I'll ride it. [Imitating engine revving] Go, Ralph! Garfield jerrniga, what are you doing in here? I was just worried about Ralph. Ralph?! Ralph the mouse. Garfield, how did this mess happen? Catso was trying to get Ralph. Oh, I've never seen-- oh, my Christmas sequins. Ohh. Ohh. Ralph, you shouldn't be talking to humans. Ah, go chew some pellets. Where's the cage? Oh, it got smashed. It's back there. I think catso knocked it over. Huh. Well, we'll, uh-- we'll clean this place up tomorrow morning. Bedtime, Mr. Garfield. Ok. Oh, and the glue is all over the place. Ralph? Ralph, where are you? I've been looking for that. Come on, garf. Ralph, Ralph, where'd you go? Hey.there you are. Don't forget my motorcycle. Ok. Garf? Ralph's motorcycle. Aha. Well, maybe we can get Ralph to help US clean this place up in the morning. Come on. Chop, chop. Hope it doesn't stink too much in there. No, not as bad as the cage. [Yawns] Good night. Good night, Ralph. [Ralph snoring] I'll take Pete. And I'll have stephie, I guess. Girl: Rhona. Boy: Eddie. Girl: Oh, Jonathan, you can have garf. We have a full team. You have to have garf. No, our team is full, too. Garf, you keep score. Let's see who goes up to bat first. Hey, we can start our own game. Right. Uh, thanks, but I have my own game to go to. Come on, Jonathan. Go, Karen. [Squeals]We win! Whoo! Come on. [Ralph and garf laugh] Wow! It's easy. You try it. Ok. Aah, aah, ahh! Aah! Sorry, Ralph. Maybe we can try something else? You guys, my watch is gone. Are you sure you left it here? Right here on this table. That was a present from my grandma. A few beans but, uh, no watch. Someone must have taken it. Who would take it? Someone who comes in here when no one else is here--garf... Jerrniga! Jerrniga! But no one saw garf take it. Let's go tell aunt Jill.

My watch. I don't have your watch. I told you he doesn't have it. He is always in the craft shop alone. You think I'd steal a watch? Yes, I do. You'd take anything.

You should go tell Karen. Oh, right. What do I say-- "oh, a mouse told me the kitten stole your watch"? She'll think I'm crazy. Then let's get the watch and give it back. But I can't just give it back to her. She'll think I swiped it for sure. What can we do? Uh...uh... What if you put it in the girls' cabin while she's gone?
