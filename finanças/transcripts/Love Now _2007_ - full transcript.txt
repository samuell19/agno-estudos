Perfect! 100% Let's call it a day! See you tomorrow. Yeah. We'll decide on the Dubai case at the meeting tomorrow. See you at 9. Where are you? Hi, where are you? I'm on my way. Where are you? Hey, I'm awfully tired. I've arrived early. Just to check on the place. I totally have to be there, hon. Yeah, love you. See you soon. Just a habit, you know. Changing Partners Thank you, for coming. Thank you, for coming. Yeah, go straight up. Shit. Uh... What's wrong with this? Can you pretend you didn't see me fooling around? I'll confess. l promise. Hey, Min-jae. When did you arrive? Hey. - Congratulations. - Thanks, pal. Nice suit. You two guys haven't met? This here's Park Young-jun. He's the blue chip in the business right now. - VP of Mano Development, conceptualizing... - That'll do. Let's not go into details. - Nice meeting you. - He's a detailed guy, you know. Min-jae here. I'm the blue chip of his life. - You call that a joke? - Can I sit over there? Yeah, the sofa's all yours. Hold on. Oh, and this lady here has supervised all the lighting in here. She's Young-jun's wife. I'm So-yeo. l'm Min-jae. Hey, Mi-sun. Hi, guys. - Hey, Mi-sun. - Yeah? You look breathless today. It's not the first time, you know. Isn't the lighting perfect in here? Doesn't So-yeo look prettier today? She's always the same. Wow- congratulation. My god! This place looks great! Hi, guys. Hello, long time no see. Where are these guys anyway? Over here. Why are you saying hi to people you don't know? Congratulation! Congratulation! You've finally become a bar owner! 10 years of buying drinks for you is over. Payback time! Of course! Two visits a week guaranteed. Okay? Yeah, but no credits. I'm so happy for you. This is really great! - Hi hon. - You're late. Oh dear. Everyone, sit, sit. That was a noisy entrance. I couldn't help but notice this fella. He's my husband. Oh, hello. This place is gorgeous. - Looks great, huh? - Yeah. Sir! - Hey there. - Come on in. Hello, sir. You didn't have trouble with the traffic? - Yeah, it was fine. - You didn't bring you wife? Why bother. Hey, Young-jun. Have you two acquainted? i told you about her. She's Seo Yu-na, and she'll provide you the VIP service. The best we have in our department. Thank you. I thought you had a leg problem. You must be feeling the weight on your shoulders with such an important role. I've heard a lot about you. I'm Seo Yu-na. No need to feel pressured. With so much work, you won't have time for shopping. Your wife's pretty busy too. i can't wear what others choose for me. You know that. That's precisely why you need her. Who would think you're the owner of Mano Development? People have to get suited to their standards. I've put you on the VIP list. You'll be in good hands. I'll do my best. Hey, Min-jae. You should be able to help So-yeo. I'm sorry? I heard about your business trip to Hong Kong. It's high season, and there won't be any rooms left. - You have one of your chain hotels there, right? - Yeah. It's okay. She won't need that. Hey, where's the love? It's all about helping out, you know. Go on, you should help her. This'll pay you back. Oh. You owe her a favor? No, what l meant was... What's this about? Hey, that tastes great. You two sure work like a couple. Don't bother. Hey, we're not regular guests. -Trying to sneak out without paying, huh? - That's called teamwork. Hush, everyone. So-yeo, does this guy get any sleep at all? He's always like this at gatherings. I knew it. So what should we do about this? - What are you doing? - There he goes again. Don't! - It didn't go in. - It didn't? The fruits look nice. Didn't that couple look great together? I envy them. Envy them? It must be her job. She has her husband well-dressed. Yeah, it's her job... ...to bother other people with what they wear. Where's my passport... Now that you're back, it's my turn to go. When will we... Time for a foot massage! lt's time for my lovely wife to get a foot massage. Don't do that with people around you. Do what? You can be a little more stuck-up, you know. Like Park Young-jun? Exactly. Did that look good to you? That was more rude than anything. I got a cast on my neck! I pity her wife. You pity her? Didn't she look a little gloomy? You sure had your eyes on her. So you want to help her? You don't have to get all snappy. You wouldn't call that help. I mean... what is there to pity her? You've heard about her husband, right? Number 2 at Mano Development. Number 2! When have you been number two in your life, huh? How come your feet becomes more beautiful with age? And her side of the family owns the nation's largest light bulb company. So she's got a rich husband, and comes from a rich family plus she's a lighting designer with her own shop at such an early age. So what part do you pity about her, huh? Right, right! So I'm wrong about that part. Damn, l'm tired. I think l'm getting old. Are you just a nice guy, or is it just being naive? Aren't you envious at all? There you go, getting all snappy again. Why should I be envious? Hey, that's precisely why we're in this miserable state, you know? Oh, come on. What's wrong with us? I quit. Hey. We won't see each other when I go on the business trip. Let go. Oh, come on Yu-na. Hey, Yu-na. You're getting less allowance from now on. End of the conversation! Hey, how can you do this to me? You know how tight my budget is. You're not the only one. I wear sample wardrobe, remember? We're not doing that badly. Right? Oh, let go. You're tickling me! Okay, okay. Deal! But you've got to fancy me. Oh, be real. What is there to fancy you about? Damn it. I'm good looking. And I'm good at bed! Let's see you get to work, tiger! Bonsoir- So-yeo! Beautiful So-yeo. This is shop access card and the address and the password here. Thank you very much. Are you sure you want to check the light tonight again? Of course, it's my job. I want to make sure everything works fine. Magnifique! Have Kim come up here. She's been waiting for a long time. It's not her first time here, either. Hello. Oh. Come on in, then. Tell Kim to come up 10 minutes later. I would say you enjoy wearing a mix-and-match style. You wear a tie, but with a leather blouson instead of a jacket. Or a suit with a shirt but with no tie. An unbalanced look suits well with your personality. But does not give you the image of a CEO. I don't wish to advertise myself as a CEO. I'm not talking about a style that's too edgy, as if you've just come down from the catwalk. Suits today come in a lot of different patterns, from active to traditional. A man named Alexander Eckhart once said, 'There are two types of men in this world, Those that just wear a suit, and those that wear them the right way.' You should start wearing suits the right way, with that classic... Let's go with this, this, and this. 30 inch waist, 100 for the chest, 38 and 'large', American size. Is Kim waiting right now? Yes, sir. Tell him to come up here. We wouldn't lose face in front of director Kang if I buy two Italian suits. I'm not here to just sell a couple of suits. Consider myself your fashion consultant. So, I need to buy more suits? No, that's not what I mean. There's a briefcase that I'd like to recommend. All right then. Send along the briefcase. Something not too boring, though. Okay. Thank you for your time. Let me know if you need anything else. When do you want your suit? Whenever you feel convenient. l'm not in a hurry. Right. You can find your way out, right? Too much work on my shoulders, you know. That young son of a bitch! You're from a good breed, huh? Please consider our proposal. It will be great for you, great for me. OK, sure... Tomorrow will be another long day. I'm ok! I'm a tough guy. Excuse me just a moment... Oh yeah, no problem... Why do l need a reason to have a drink? You can't fool me, girl. You're in a bad mood tonight. I am not. Give me another shot! Wow. This guy must really be someone to make you feel this mad. He's not worth a crap. There you go again. Who is this fella? Your pal. My pal? Which pal? Young-jun? Let's not talk about this. Oh, we meet again! Hey, you... What brings you here Young-jun? Never heard you were coming. One of my appointments were cancelled, so I thought I'd drop by for a drink. That's great! We were getting a little bored, the two of us. Take a seat! Let's drink! Uh, come sit over here... I'll be at the bar. Talk to you later. No, no, no. Drink with us, come on! I'm interrupting your conversation. No, really! We were bored. Hey, join us. Don't be so shy. You've all been acquainted, let's drink. We were getting so bored. Sit. Have a drink. Come on, sit over here. That was close... Chul-ju, let's drink some wine. Alright. This is a dish made from a fish called Garupa. This fella here looks just like my boss. And this is the Mantis shrimp, very sweet flesh. We're even with this treat, you know. Could I ask you another favor? Sure! What can I do for you? I have to check on the lights but I don't know my way around here. Can I have a look at that? - I have no idea where this is. - I think... it's over that side. You would look good on a very formal suit, you know. Why don't you try a classic London Savile Row-style tailored suit? You would look awesome in that. While dress shirt matched with a silk tie, and a navy color two-button suit or... A three-button suit would be a safer choice, if you're looking to succeed in business! Perfect. One hundred percent! Does everyone in your business talk like that? Huh? You seem to mix in English all the time. It sounds pretty retarded when you use English like that on a sentence. Don't you think? Well... Most trend-setting nations do speak English. So it is hard to find the right expression in Korean. So if I want to buy something from you, I'll have to make a 'reservation' with a 'phone call', right? Do you have meals every now and then with your 'clients'? Oh, in your business... You would call it 'lunch'. You would do 'business' and share 'love'. You're right. But the next stage is the same for every business. Next stage? Yeah, the stage after 'love'. 'Sex'! People in your business do that, right? To think of it, you guys at the construction business would be involved in an intercourse than have sex, right? Hey, what's this about sex? There's an air of lewdness here that I haven't sensed before. I'll leave you guys to talk. No, you would actually 'copulate'. But we folks using English in between have 'sex' or 'fuck'! Leaving already? Should be the next block ahead. What did you say to piss her off like that? Nothing much. You toyed with her in the afternoon too? Toy her? She's no toy, you know. Yu-na looks confident but she is having a hard time. Give her a break! She supports both Min-jae and her family, and her sister got swindled in marriage. Be nice to her. She's not a stranger. Don't want to hear about it. Oh... You want someone to drive you home? Or do you want to take a cab? Give her a break, man. Look at her! Shit, it's cold. Yu-na. SEO Yu-na! What do you think you're doing? Let go! Or you drunk or are you mad? It's something expensive! And it's not mine. A little rain won't harm anything. I'll buy it off you. Have you been such an ass all along? Let's finish the conversation. Finish what? Do you want to get beat by a girl? I buy a suit off you and you want to beat that client, huh? All right! Huh? Hey! Pretty, isn't it? It's still a prison to the birds. But doesn't that look sincere? Trying to keep a bird that one loves, and at least trying to keep the bird in a pretty cage. So... let's put it this way. I'd like to be beat with the prettiest lash if I'm being tortured. Or be stuck with a golden spear. If I'm to die. Let's find the shoe store first. We can come back here tomorrow. Not tomorrow. I'm leaving on a morning flight. Too bad. Are you always this quick in giving up? But there's no other solution! What if I come up with one? You don't believe in me? What are doing? Min-jae! it's okay. No one's going to look anyway. Don't be a fool. I'm going for it. What do you think you're doing? Ha, fooled you. It's over here. Enough with fooling around. I'll get you a cage. You can't fool me twice. This time it's for real. Go ahead. All right, you said it. Here goes. Can't stop it now. What have you done? Sorry, sorry sir... I?m calling the police! I'm sorry. That wasn't on purpose. So-yeo, run! No, no, this way! What's wrong? Take one step at a time. We didn't even break the window, what's with him? My sentiments exactly. - Here. - Right... How's your ankle? Did you sprain it? Yeah... it's okay. You sure? Yeah. See? He's still following us! What? Don't leave me behind! So-yeo. No one's following us. So-yeo, it's a lie! What are we here for? You said you wanted to beat me up. Let's see who beats up who. Feel free to come up here. We, at Fight Club, will take full responsibility. Come up and relieve your stress, and you'll be eligible for lots of prizes. As the ring announcer, I will give you one last chance... For the first time ever, a beautiful lady is approaching the ring. Man, you guys are lucky tonight! Welcome! This way, ma'am. Standing at 5'7'', with a bodacious bodyline. The Jean D'arc of mixed martial arts... And it looks like she's pointing at someone... This guy's a loser if he doesn't stand to the challenge. I?d love to get beat by this beauty here. Come on! Loser! Well, what do you know. Here's our man stepping in! I'm not letting you off because you're a girl. Beat me and talk trash. All right. Fight! Fight me, you chicken! Did you just hit me? Hey, it's a full moon. So-yeo, have you ever experienced this? You know... What did l think of that night, to do such a crazy thing? During those nights, there always seems to be a full moon. That's mean of them. Why make an excuse on a full moon? So-yeo, have you ever had a date with a man other than your husband, at a place you've come for the first time? No. You see, that would be an unusual event. You look up the sky, and... there you have it. Is that for real? - So-yeo. - Yeah? You look better with your hair down. Wow. Sorry. I've got to check on the lights, because the shop opens tomorrow. I know this singer. You do? The guy who sang the song... His friend's brother's roommate was close with... My mother's secret boyfriend. Hold on. His friend's brother's... Whoa, that's a real destiny. Do you know that when a woman has a secret... she's bound to tell that to one certain person? You shouldn't tell our secret. Our secret? What secret? We almost broke someone's window. That's a little lame for a secret. Huh? One shot! Come on, spit it out. What is your problem? There's something you've got figured all wrong. Figured all wrong? So I was hoping to teach you what's right. Ha. Teach me? A while ago you've mentioned... That it's sex after dating for everyone. You're wrong. We have sex first. Then we decide whether we'll date or not. Sex is just sex. There's no need to date. Treating something, buying flowers... You do that to take a girl into bed. You've got that right. Are you hitting on me? If I am... Will you fall for it? What would l do with a kid like you? It says it all in your face. "I feel desperate". Good night. Have a safe trip back to Seoul. Where would you people have sex without us in the construction business? We make that possible because we provide the space Don't you think? So you'll build hotels naked without us? Let's see you do it. With your thing bouncing up and down. Don't bother me after you've had a taste of me. We do it full time, with 45 minute halves. Soccer? Ha. We do a marathon. We start when the marathon starts, all the way till the last guy crosses the finish line. No breaks in between. Did you know that? Bad killer instincts and shooting touch... If that's how bad you are, don't even try playing the match. Fair play! If you're into having all the fun for yourself, you won't leave this place alive. Understand? Fair play? That's a good term. Don't get all dirty after we go through the game. What? Don't pester me with stupid demands. I knew it. Filthy blue collars. That's the mentality that you guys have. Did the other girls want something else after they hop into bed with you? It must've been real bad, wanting something else in return. It was a joke. Don't get all bitchy about that. Let go! You disgust me. You feel your stamina wilt with age, your skin goes dull, and when there's nothing left to charm the guys, that's when you're done with. So the great Oh Mi-sun will get married before she's done with? No, it's just a thought! It passed through my mind, you know. Will Chul-ju marry you? Who said l was marrying him? What? You mean there's someone else? Drink. Huh? l envy you, Mi-sun. It's for you. Seo Yu-na speaking. Hello? It's Young-jun here. Another staff has been assigned to you. And who's call was that? I don't see the need of continuing our conversation. Who is it? No need to know. I haven't seen you talk that mean before. No way it's a client of yours. Something's fishy here... Seo Yu-na here. Thank you for calling. I'll call back in 10 minutes. Promise! Seo Yu-na here. Thank you for calling. Perfect timing. I just arrived. What's with your voice? What about it? Aren't you glad to hear my voice? I feel tired, that's all. Look over the 11 o'clock direction. - Did you have a hard time? - Huh? Yeah, couldn't sleep well. I think I've caught a cold. What about you? How did you fare without me? I missed you. More than any other instance. Don't switch it off. How am I? I'm sorry? To women. How do I fare as a man? You're sick. What? An asshole too. That's a little rude. Hey... Am I really that sick? Do I look better with my hair tied up or down? Turn off the lights. This isn't the first time, you know. I swear this will be the last time. 30 grand. Then your sister will get the divorce. I?m busy. Don't call me with stuff like this. Hey, hey! It's a call for you. Park Young-jun? - This is for Ms. Kim. Hold onto it. - Okay. Hello? Does the buyer usually have to look for the seller? I thought I had told you that there's someone else for you. I need something for an event. I'll let the new personnel... No need. I want you to choose my wardrobe. I'll have to hang up, I'm busy. - Hyun-kyung, this one too. - Yes. You never know what she'll look for. Right. Why record the voice if you're not calling back? Making people wait... Keep your promise next time. That's all. Yes. Mr. Park, you must be having lunch? Alone in your executive office? Having sushi with a pile of paperwork by your side? Take some time to look back at yourself, Mr. Park. You'll realize how lonely and pathetic you are. That'll be all. There's a package for you. Sir... The sample for the gallery arrived from the head office. Aren't you going to take a look? Sir. Why let out a sigh in front of food? - Because l'm hungry. - But you're not eating. I?m eating. Look. Satisfied? Hey, check out that girl over there. She's eating all alone, and without any soju. She must've been dumped by a guy. - I've been wanting to call you... - Are you always this quick in giving up? - See you tomorrow. - Okay. How about a truce at this stage? You really are some client. It's all my fault. I beg for your forgiveness. Getting drunk is a bad excuse. We were both very sober. So you really meant to treat me like a whore? You looked like a pro, working up a guy and leaving like that. Is this the attitude of someone who has come for truce? You're the one playing down on me right now. I'm not interested. I've never been treated like this before. Move! Seo Yu-na! Are you out of your mind? How can you speed in a parking lot, lady? I'm sorry. Let's get this over with. Doesn't seem like a big accident to me. Who're you, anyway? I'm her guardian. Guardian, bull shit. She's no kid, you know. Is he your husband? No. Who is he then? - He's a stalker. - What? Stalker? He's been spying on me for a few days. What nonsense are you talking? He was waiting for me in front of the office, so l was trying to shake off him. Seo Yu-na! This is getting a little too out of hand. Are you serious? You look pretty normal to me. Just give him a warning. I'll give him a good talk as well. He does seem to listen to others... so don't be too hard on him. - Thank you, officer. - Take care on your way back home. What is he doing in there? He must've done something wrong. He should gladly pay for it, then. Why didn't you tell us in the first place? Would you like some tea before you leave? Seo Yu-na! Take care. Stop right there! What do you think you're doing? Are you satisfied now? You're damn right, I'm satisfied. So you got one back on me. We're even now. Okay? Don't make a fool out of other people, okay? Why? It's fun. Not to me. All right, I admit that I made a fool out of you. But I don't do that to people I don't care about! This is the first time I've done this... Ever since I did it to my neighbor when I was 10. I swear. What is it that you want? I told you. A truce. Is that all? - Let's go for a truce first... - Then what? Haven't thought about it. Hey, when people want to reconcile, they try to flatter or wait until the anger passes. You can't flatter a girl, can you? So let's just wait until the anger passes. Let's have some coffee. I'm trying to flatter you, that's all. Hey, Seo Yu-na! You've got some change? Jung Min-jae! Hey. What are you doing here? I had to meet someone here. I was on my way home. I'm going home too. Yeah, I'm done. - Let's go then. - Right... What brought you here? I had an appointment with someone. I was on my way back. Min-jae, does your heart still throb when you see me? Huh? Does your heart still pound when you look at me? That was a little unexpected. Why? Come on, answer me. Do you still feel that way? Hold on. Let me see... 4 years of dating, and 3 years of marriage... ...and we have a diagnosis. If the heart is still beating like that, it should be a heart disease. Jung Min-jae, you insolent bastard. Yu-na. Don't call me. You've hurt my feelings. Make me go crazy about you again. Do you really feel that way about me now? Hey, long time no see. I've been looking for you all day. And you weren't answering my calls either. Let's see... in 3 minutes, It'll be exactly 24 hours. I'm not in the mood for a joke now. I understand how you would've felt last night. But... I can't guarantee that something like that will not happen again. There will be tougher times ahead. Why are you telling me this? I thought I had to tell you. About your situation. The circumstances and all. And what difference will that make? Someone has to pull the plug. What am I going to do? I can't think of anything but you, Min-jae. Perfect. One hundred percent! You leave me and don't give a call? Leave you? I went my way and you went yours. I got out of the way because you might feel uncomfortable. Uncomfortable? Why? I thought we had a truce. I thought I had told you that I needed some time. I'm not good at waiting. I'll flatter you instead. Well then, don't antagonize me. What brings you here? I'm here to see CHO Yu-na. I'm CHOl Dong-sup. She's not in. Please step outside! Who's that? You don't need to know. Tell your manager her sister's husband is here to see her! What's going on? What is this all about? - Wait. Don't do this. - Hey, Seo Yu-na! This isn't funny at all. - Please. - Let's do business the safe way. Shit, do you want your sister to get in trouble? Hey, you know what your sister did to me? I've been set up. Set up real bad, you hear? Let's call it a deal at 30 grand. I'm a victim too, you know. Take him outside! Go change your suit. I'll take it to your car. Who's that? Young-jun's step-mother. Hello. Hi, there. Working so late? What brings you here? I was passing by and saw the lights on. Is he a new employee? I'm from the construction company. Is that right? So-yeo, I'll talk to you later then. Right. How's everything going? Fine. I'll be on my way then. Leaving already? Don't stay here till late at night. Your husband won't like it. I'll see you at your father-in-law's birthday. Take care. It'll be okay. Right. Nothing happened, really. Let's go to Hong Kong. Hong Kong? It was great at Hong Kong, the two of us. There's no one to recognize us... Alright. I'm going to Hong Kong right now! Answer the phone, damn it! So you're here to rake in some cash? You can't have it for free, though. Call me. Hey, Yu-na. That's some pimp you have there. What have you done? No need to know. Who do you think you are anyway? Pretend you didn't see that. Do you think I'm stupid? Yeah. Do I look pathetic to you? Yeah. Pretty much. I know you're crying because you're flattered. That'll be the last favor. What do you mean? It only has just started. 'Until we satisfy'. There's nothing I can do to return the favor. Have I asked for anything? You know... what I mean. I can't leave my husband like this. What about me? You can't live without me? No. See what l mean? Your husband will feel the same way. You girls misjudge men. Min-jae's not like you! I really wanted to flirt with you, Seo Yu-na... Can I speak to Jung Min-jae? I wish to thank him for the arrangements. Really? Tell him to drop by the members' lounge when he returns. Or I'll go there to meet him. All right. Thank you. I'm telling you this because I like So-yeo. You've got to end this sort of relationship. Hmm. Right. Did you make it out of the ladies' room safely? Of course. What's that tone then? Hmm? You sound weary. Must be a weak throat. You shouldn't be calling... With your husband around. I've got something to do, I won't be able to see you tonight. Overtime work. Let's talk Iater. I thought you wouldn't pick up. Should l hang up then? That temper of yours... Is everything aII right? Yeah. You alone? Why should I be alone? My husband's always by my side. Like your wife is by your side, Young-jun. Thanks for reminding me. I'll hang up since I've heard your voice. Wait. Don't eat by yourself! Don't bother if you're not going to eat with me. Hang up. There's a guest calling to order. - Hey. - Hey! You made it. Hello! Good to see you all. So... Is everyone here? We have an announcement to make. We're getting married! Who? You and me? Right, I decided to let you get married to me. You should be proud! Don't you think that's a little too one-sided? You're got the bar and apartment mortgaged. You need someone to rescue your life. Hey, you shouldn't believe entirely what my father tells you. Mi-sun, why get married at the prime of life? You've still got it all. There's nothing to lose. I would say the same thing to Chul-ju. There are younger girls all over the place. Not all men think like you do, my dear. Women these days aren't like you either. That's why I don't bring her to gatherings. Who made her come, anyway? Stop toying with your cell phone. What have you been doing? What is it with you these days? You're not like you used to be. There are times, Yu-na. Times? What times? Forget it. Something's strange today. Should I have kept the announcement for later? It's not like we're breaking up, you know. Damn, what is it with you people? Yu-na. Am I doing the right thing? I don't know... One thing I'm sure of is that it becomes quite boring as you live along. Hey there's no couple more into each other than you guys. I just had to make him mine when I first met him. I could feel the passion when I saw his face. And you don't feel that now? If you feel that now, you're ill. Nothing excites me anymore. Stop that. I can see that your relationship has reached its peak. Pretty much. What's up with you guys? How are you guys? Nothing has changed between us after we got married. Really? I envy you guys. I've never felt passionate about him. I'm beginning to like this gathering! Mr. Park. What have you done to make her say that? Is not being passionate a bad thing? There's no need to get all cold if you're not passionate. Jung Min-jae. What is wrong with you? Are you drunk? I'm not saying that it's bad, but it's not a good thing either. What is this guy saying? Min-jae! Can I ask you something? No, we'll talk later. This is weird. Is there something wrong with the drinks? I'll go check. Do we have bootlegs here? Why does my stomach hurt? Let's go home. It looks original to me... Why are you doing this to me? The ladies' room is on the opposite side. I've never feared losing what l have since I started seeing you. But it looks like you're the one getting scared. That's easy for you to say. Is that because you're rich? I haven't got much, and I've paid a lot to earn what I have now. That's why I'm scared of losing them I'm like that, you know. I know you're doing that on purpose I'll wait at 'Beginning'. Don't. What are you doing? Wait... The toilets blocked! We get that often these days. Use the one on the second floor. Mi-sun, am I drunk? You will be if you drink at that rate. Where's Min-jae? How would I know? I asked Yu-na. You going? I'm leaving too. Yu-na. Sit here for a little while. Mi-sun, talk to her! Stay, Yu-na. What's with you? Sit down, girl! Hey, let's have another drink. Shit, I knew she wouldn't listen to me. Hey, forget it, I'm not getting involved in this anymore! Seo Yu-na! Your husband... If he says he'll be able to live without you... Can we make it happen? Answer me. No. I can't live without him. Chul-ju! Hey. I want to ask for a favor. Min-jae must be seeing someone else. Talk him to end the relationship. I owe you one. They're close friends of yours. I'm leaving. Young-jun, hey! Oh man... Yu-na. What are you doing here? Is that true? What is? About Min-jae seeing someone else. Is that true? Hey, Yu-na... You should know better. He can't live without you. What do I do, Chul-ju? What am I going to do? Yu-na, are you asleep? I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. What for? About being all petty... not giving you enough pocket money... I'm sorry. Yu-na. We both know that we've come this far because of you. Min-jae, let's have a baby. You wanted that, right? Yu-na, I've got something to tell you. I must be drunk. Let's talk later. Will you... ...hit me, Yu-na? Aren't you coming to bed? I've got a question to ask you. Am I... ...really that cold-hearted? Yeah. You didn't know? That's what makes you attractive. That's what I fell for too. Can I ask something too? Was... I... ...a woman to you? You're my wife. But when you said we were never passionate, I realized that you were a woman. When did you say you were leaving for Hong Kong? Next weekend. Should I go with you? You're just saying that, right? Yeah. Oh, beautiful night. - That was some wedding ceremony! - Thank you. - You look wonderful, dear! - Thank you so much. You guys still haven't left? You really want to drink, huh? Here, have a drink. Come on. Right. l'd be glad to! So, you've settled everything? Yeah. It's not easy doing a son's duty. What's not easy? You've got a beautiful wife! Now that l see it, I wish l could get married again. You guys won't die for each other, right? Of course not. No, not at all. You won't feel like a victim, then. So you won't have to hate each other. felt like a victim whenever he flirted. That's why I hate him. I couldn't show that to my kids, so now l've got a lump on my chest. Why didn't you tell me about this? I couldn't bear watching you enjoy. Man, this is why l didn't want to bring her along. Sir, don't live like that, damn it. What? You really like the young ones, don't you? What's wrong with you? Chul-ju! Let's exchange partners if you're so much into young girls. What did you say? Hey. Everyone's changing partners, So why not us? Why you son of a... Alright. Let's do it! Are you drunk? What's wrong with that? You're doing it, so why can't I do the same? Hey, Chul-ju's drunk. Take him to the hotel. Let's go! Hey, cut the crap. I'll help you guys out, too. I can't stand you guys sulk any longer. So I'll settle everything for you! You know how? I've got the solution right here. Stop it. Are you crazy? Yeah, I'm crazy. You see, l had to pretend to be naive all along, that must've made me go mad. I'm crazy. So what? - Hey, Kang Chul-ju! - Sir, sir! We should swap too. You like younger girls, right? No, to think of it... Let's all swap here. Okay? Come here, you little piece of shit! - Settle down. - Flirt, flirt! I'm not marrying a madman like that. Well thought, Mi-sun! Look at these guys over here... They meet. They get bored. So they look for someone else. Min-jae here likes So-yeo... And Young-jun here, worries about Yu-na. Bastard. l'm getting rid of this ring right now! Mi-sun. Mi-sun! Don't do this! - Let go! - He's drunk, Mi-sun. l said, let go! Oh no! Chul-jung's father passed away. Yeah, I should go. Want me to pick you up? May Damiano KANG rest in eternal peace. Lord, hear our prayer. May the Lord's words pass upon generations to come, these are the words of the gospel. How's your sister doing? Is she preparing for the wedding? I don't know why she's getting married again. She should be happy now. That's funny. Who says marriage guarantees happiness? Was I happy before? I don't even remember. You can be mad about me, Yu-na. But don't erase all the good memories. Do you still eat by yourself? Yeah. I'm a loner. I'm curious. Why did you marry me? I went to the construction site and saw a girl on a suit wearing a helmet. You usually don't wear helmets because it ruins your suit. But this girl had a helmet on. I wanted to find out more about her. So you came to see me before the actual meeting? Yeah. So... We didn't start out that bad either. My car's over there. Take care. Bye. Bye. See you guys later. Bye. Bye. You lost your way on purpose in Hong Kong, right? What? You were teasing me, weren't you? Who talked to me about the full moon? You're the one that called it a lame secret. I'm going to Hong Kong next month. Lucky you. Garupa and Mantis shrimp, remember all that? I'll think about it. Who said l was taking you?
