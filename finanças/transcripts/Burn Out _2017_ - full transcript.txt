Subtitles by explosiveskull Tony Rodrigues takes the lead. What a damn shame. With the right bike, you'd have won. Mike Paterson. I'm starting a new stable with Ducati. We signed Chris Walker. We need a second rider. If you're interested, come for the trials. TEAM PATERSON MIKE PATERSON CIRCUIT LFG Sorry, I couldn't get away. I told you I had an interview. - Want a lift? - What do we do with him? Three on your bike? We've done it before. Forget it, I'll manage. Put this on, honey. I'll call you tonight. Up you get. Your feet. Are you sulking, too? Pity, I had a surprise for you. - What is it? - I won't tell you now, sulky face. C'mon, Dad! Is Mom still with that guy Samir? He doesn't come over much anymore. Do you still scowl at him? - Yeah. - Show me what you do. Good. Great. Thanks, girls. Hi, honey. You're OK? Yes. - Hey. - You're OK? How was your interview? I don't know. We'll see. - I'll just take a shower. - OK. - Pick him up on Friday at 6? - Yeah. Okay. Gentlemen, welcome. Our goal is to win the Superbike Championship, then the GP. So, we need the best of you 4. We'll work you hard. Caroline will do the paperwork, then you can warm up on the track. Hey, you can't park there. - How's it going? - Good, and you? So, you're turning pro? Who told you? We haven't forgotten you. The way you used to burn up the tarmac. - So, are you in? - Not yet. They'll keep one of us. I can deal with 'em. I'm joking! - How's your Mom? - Fine. - She's happier there. - Tell me when you go. - OK. - Portuguese chicks love me! - Tell her I said hi. - Sure. Bye. What happened? Leyla... - Hey... - Get off! Talk to me, dammit! - What're you doing? - Calling the cops. Hang up. - So, what happened? - I've been hiding drugs here. What? You heard me. You're shitting me. It was only temporary. Just a few months. Till I got a job. Why didn't you tell me? I'd have helped you. You're broke, Tony. You spend your money on your bike. Do you realize what you've done? Did you consider Sofiane? Since when have you cared? You just care about yourself. Why did they hit you? The drugs were stolen. I'm sure it was Samir. Only he knew. How much was there? 50,000. Shit. I have a week to pay or they'll be back. We'll work it out. You can stay at my place. You can't stay here. Hey. Here are some towels and pillows. Thanks. If you need anything... OK. Yo! - Want weed? - I wanna see Moussa. - No Moussa here. - I know him. You don't get it. Fuck off. You fuck off. Max! Drop it. - Looking for your bike? - Yeah. It's not safe here. Max, go get his bike. - You OK? - Can we talk? Guys are squeezing you out. Yeah. So? You do nothing? I can't stop the gypsies. Leyla's in trouble. What kind of trouble? She owes them money. I wanna meet them. Moussa, please... It must be Jordan. He works for Miguel. Miguel's a big shot. Only works with his own. You can't get near them. - Jordan got a tattoo on his neck? - Yeah. OK. - I need to talk to him. - Forget it. And forget the cops. I know how it works here. What are you talking about? You grew up in a nice house. - Not in the hood, biker boy. - I'll handle it. - Will you? - Yeah. - Leyla has to pay them back. - She can't. - So, I need to see them. - Are you deaf? So, where can I find them? BAR THE THIRST BETS Hello. I'm looking for Jordan. No Jordan here. I'll have a coffee. What d'ya want? It's about Leyla. Got my money? No, that's just it. It's not her fault. Her ex stole your gear. Oh, OK. I don't give a shit. She shouldn't let bums fuck her. She can't pay. She owes me. Period. Scram. That's a fine bike. - It must go fast. - Yeah. Your back tire is bald. Do you race your friends? Yeah, sometimes. So, you wanna help your girl? She's my son's mom, not my girl. - She's your son's mom? - Yeah. You OK with her stashing gear? Not a great role model, is she? Look, I'll soon be a pro racer. I can pay in instalments. Over 10 years, every month? Think I'm a bank? Give me time to find a solution. Start by selling your bike. Your girl could work for us. Jordan said she's pretty. Think it over. Need a hand? No, it's OK. Are we in the way? No. I'm glad you're here. Are you sure? Yeah. Why? I don't know. You usually tire of us fast. Mom... Come see what I've done. OK, honey. - Hello. - Still wanna help her? Yeah. Sit your ass down. Come on. - What? - I said, come on. Leave your helmet. Follow me.

Gimme the bag. - The key. - It's there. - Hello. - Was it a close call? Yeah, very close. I can't carry on like this. - Why? - The bike's speed restricted. I need full power. 100 HP is no good. I need a second bike, too. It's the only way not to get caught. We'll see. Put Jordan back on. Here. What? He doesn't know a thing. I'll find someone. No need for two bikes. Why not a bus, too?! I told you I don't trust him. OK, I'll do that. Here. Miguel doesn't want this here. See you at the hideout. Tony? - I woke you? - I couldn't sleep. Where were you? Standing in for a colleague. Sorry, I should've told you. What is it? I went to see Moussa. Your problem's settled. He knows people. We worked it out. What do you mean, we worked it out? You don't owe them anything.

Moussa, please... Go back to your corner boys. Hey, Farid. Yo, man. - Your delivery boy? - Yes. Miguel, it's great to work with you. Arabs aren't usually your thing. - Ready? - Yeah. It's simple. Go along here to the bridge, through the tunnel, then turn left. Keep going to a red lamppost. Dump the bag there. - By the lamppost? - Yeah. Repeat it. The bridge, the tunnel, turn left, red lamppost. There's 50 grand in there, so no fuck-ups. We won't stay here forever. If you're not back in ten minutes, we'll go, you're on your own.

Hello? He's back there! Come back, guys! Come back or you're dead! You fuckin' bastard! Drop the bag! There he is! Get in! Go, go! We're safe now. I'll kill your fuckin' Farid! He set up the deal. Tarek tried to screw us. We were delivering it to him. He took advantage of all this mess. Farid is legit. And are you legit? - What? - Why defend him? Are you on the take? What? I'm on the take? - I'll call him and ask. - No! I don't wanna see him. But you find me Tarek. Tell Farid he owes me for the bike. It'll teach him not to treat me like that.
