Shaowu, let's go to grandma's in Kinmen. Did you say landmine? What's that? Snake! It's a snake. Block it! - Wait, there! Over there! - Let me catch it. My dad lied. He said the snakes were all eaten by soldiers. Yeah? Let's use it to scare Shaowu. - Bastard! - We'll put it in her drawer tomorrow. Idiot! What are you doing? Are you scared? Loser.

Shaowu, what are you looking at? Let's go. Okay. Boss, it's time. - Dreamer, let's go. - Go. Let's go, go, go. Stop fooling around. What were you thinking? Why did you bring so many guys? It's a memorial. I told them to come to make it look good. It was only a few guys. It's my ex-wife's memorial. I'm just helping. Does it need to look good? We wanted to make it look good. I thought more is better. Didn't you see my ex-mom-in-law? She looked mad. She gave you a dirty look. She doesn't like wiseguys. Wiseguys are human, too. You helped out and paid for it. Where could she find an ex like you? Exactly. Stop the nonsense. Go feed them. Is it enough? For noodles? It's not enough. Okay! One more! Grandma. Don't cry. Shaowu! Jade! Yeliu! It's beautiful. I've never been there. I don't remember being there. Shaowu, your mom died. And you didn't cry? I'm not very sad. I never knew my parents well, anyway. I'm sorry, Shaowu. It's okay. I'm my grandma's kid. Eat. I'm not hungry. Why? Grandma, why do you hate Keigo? Grandma, is Keigo a bad guy? We shouldn't get close to a man like him. I told your mom not to marry him but she wouldn't listen to me. Love is blind. Love? They ended up divorcing. Who divorced whom? Your mom divorced him. It's not Keigo's fault then. It was her fault to marry him! F*ck you. Your dad didn't teach you? When someone has a gun, back off. No one told you? Your dad didn't teach you? When someone has a gun, back off. It was her fault to marry him! What are you doing? Go to bed! Okay. I was looking for it. You are so naughty. Go to bed! Uncle Tsai! Uncle Tsai! Please take my place. Here. Have a seat. Shaowu, what brought you here? Uncle, do you know Keigo? Keigo? Don't be rude. You should call him Dad. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter? That's rude. He's never been my dad, anyway. You... want to go see him? Your grandma won't let you go. I know. Your grandma is so stubborn. Your dad's not a bad guy. Why won't he visit me, then? Okay. Have a seat. Your mom didn't want your dad to get closer to you,­ that's why she brought you to Kinmen. But my mom died. No, you... You don't understand what I mean. Okay. Enough. I understand. Oh no! What's wrong? I have to go to an after-school class. I forgot. After-school class? Yes. My mom says I have to. Do you want to leave with me? No. You go first. You sure? Jade! Jade! You okay? Bun! You're dead! Oh really? You loser! Jerk! Bitch! No Dad, no Mom! No one loves you! Shaowu... Jade, what's wrong? Hey, Buckteeth, what're you eating? So lame. Dumped cowshit on him? That's funny. Cover a snotty kid with cowshit. Stinky! Bun's mom wants Shaowu expelled from school. What? Seriously? That's right. His father is a city councilman. Shaowu's so stubborn. And you're old. Get someone to talk to the school for you. That's right. If you go and something goes wrong, we won't be able to flirt­ and have fun anymore. Cut it out! Okay. Let me look into it. Call me. Keigo! Nan! Keigo Boss! Tigu Boss called. He's coming back. Yeah? It's been a long time. He's been working on a big deal in Thailand. Always trying to get rich. Invested in the shrimp biz and got burned. You're different. You're disciplined, not greedy. And he likes you for that. Dreamer, Goldie, go help with Coco's shop. She has to leave. Okay. Come over and have some tea. Yankees are two runs behind. I'm screwed. F*cked! What are you showing me? Stop making big bets. You'll lose big! ♫ I ask God, I ask God... Sis! Where's Goldie? He'll be right here. Sir, thanks for coming. Captain, come back. Coco is here. Turn it off. I will sing later. Coco, my darling Miss Malaysia,­ you're finally here. Captain, I'm sorry. Got to go. Lots to do. Let me toast everyone. Here! No, no. It's not right. Go? You just came. Captain, Coco will be right back. Sakura will drink with you! Scum bag... Sleaze! Hi. Sit over there. Liquor or beer? Beer. What song? I Ask God. Got to go. Take good care of them. Okay. Let me sing for you! Same song again? Needle must be stuck! It's the same song. Change it. Turn it off! Stop it! Stop it! What the f*ck! It's all yours? No one gets to sing? - Who are you? - Who are you? F*cker, you don't know who I am? I am the head of the Gangster Squad. Got a problem? F*ck you! Go f*ck yourself! Chang, you f*cking asshole! You really p*ssed me off! Sakura, thanks for the hard work. Go home. I will go then. Dreamer is so hot-headed. Keigo, later. Business is bad enough. And he messed up big time... You beat up a cop when you were young, too. I wasn't a moron like him. Mom. Okay. I'll go and handle it. Take a sip. Good. It's great. Dreamer. Keigo. Grandpa's awake. Is he better? Yeah. He's got a good appetite. Grandpa, I need to talk to Dreamer. How're things going with Chang? Check this out. He's suing me for 2 million. 2 million. I should have killed him. You fry your brain with drugs? No. He went too far. Too far? You put him in the hospital. He's complaining that you haven't visited him. Do I need to? Need to? What about the 2 million? Go with Goldie. Okay. You won't go with me? I'm going to Kinmen. Shaowu is in trouble. What trouble? She p*ssed off a crazy woman. Who could be crazier than me? Let me go help. Just mind your own business. Don't forget to bring a gift. Okay. JINCHENG HIGH SCHOOL - Where is it? - Here. - Hi, Boss. - Sure? There's the sign. What? Boss, did you take care of the problem? We are at the hospital. We have a question... Do we have to go in? How about we ask the nurse to bring him flowers? Aren't you going to include a card? Will it kill you to apologize to him? Okay. Don't go. Don't ever call me Boss again. I got it. You want a gangster to represent you. Councilman, is that allowed? I come as Shaowu's parent today. But Mrs. Zhang calls me a gangster. That bothers me. How can we have a civilized discussion? Sorry! What is this sh*t? You want to start all over again? What's your problem? - Get out! - F*ck! Shaowu must apologize. Hello, Bun. Look at me. I am Shaowu's dad. You see? You triggered Jade's asthma. Won't you first apologize to her? You said Shaowu has no parents. Shouldn't you apologize to me first­ and then Shaowu? Well? Let's go! - What are you doing? - No need to say more. Vice principal, we will see! Sorry. Wait... Captain... I am... Really? I'm in Kinmen now. We'll discuss it when I get back to Taipei. Hey! What's wrong with you? A fight in the hospital! You brought some lame flowers as a gift? Are you crazy or just cheap? You p*ss me off! Wait till I get back! Mister, no smoking at school. Oh... sorry. And the teacher wants to see you. Bun's mother told the vice principal that­ she's going to start a protest campaign. We suggest that Shaowu­ find a school in Taipei to attend. Miss, I want to talk to the vice principal. The vice principal... already left. Now I see who is really in charge. Mr. Chen, it's not like that. It's also good for Shaowu. Keigo. Shaowu must be very happy now. What? She wants to go to Taipei. She's my only grandchild. Please take good care of her. You are awful. I was so sad. Sorry. My grandma was there. I had to hide it. I was hiding my sadness. You're so corny. Okay, then! Let me tell your grandma! Hey, I'm sorry. Don't be mad! Okay. You have to send me­ yummy treats from Taipei every week. Forget it. You can eat sh*t! I'm not Bun. Shaowu, did you see that? They bring good luck! Horseshoe crab, be my good luck charm! Grandma, I caught it. Please cook it! Put it over there. What now? Grandma, can you show me how to cook? Strange. I wanted to teach you before but you weren't interested. Not true. It's good you're interested now. No one will teach you in Taipei. Come on. Like this. Hold it. The bride can't wait till her wedding day­ to learn how to cook. You're only interested 'cause­ you're going to live with your dad. What grade are you in now? - Ninth grade. - Ninth grade? You're in Junior High then. Yes. Time flies. Do you have a crew? Just two guys. Two guys. But I saw a lot in the memorial. Oh. They just came to help. Do you have a Tong? Tong? Oh, it's a company. Company? You must be the general manager. Something like that. This way! Your room is upstairs. Come up and see. Keigo, you use the computer? No. I bought it for you. Thanks. Get some rest. Then we'll go out for dinner. This way. My friend reserved a table. Coco. Shaowu. Miss Coco. Hi, Miss Coco. Hi. Just call me Coco. Are you tired? No. Is there anything you want to see in Taipei? I haven't thought about it. You could ask Keigo to show you around. Did you wait for a long time? Not long. Would you like anything else? It's good with vinegar. Thank you. Shaowu, here's some vinegar for the dumplings. It's okay. I got it. You use so much? I love vinegar. This is for Keigo. From me. Thanks. Can you see me? - Hello! - Hi! Hi! Long time no see! Yeah.

I didn't know you had such a pretty daughter. Where have you been hiding her? Oh... She just moved in with me. You are blessed. You know them very well? I eat here often. You protect them, right? Chairman Lin... It was my pleasure. Having tea? Okay. I will be right over. You're going to school in a couple of days? Shall I drive you there? No. I'll go by myself. I bought you a cell phone. Call me if you want. - Here, Boss Keigo. - Cool. Enjoy. Thank you. No one told you? Your dad didn't teach you? When someone has a gun, back off. Got it? I woke you up. No. Go to bed. I'll help you go upstairs. No, thanks. Go to bed. Shaowu, study hard. Don't become a loser like me. Good night, Keigo. Come help. You're getting me wet. Keigo, what's that tattoo on your back? I want to see it. No. I want to see it. Party pooper. Spoil sport. You take the hose. Okay. Stop it. CHEN SHINWU Class, we have a new classmate,­ Chen Shinwu. Please welcome her.

It's your turn next time then. Okay! How's school? Okay. Just okay? That means not great. Is there something wrong? No. Hey Keigo, why are you called Keigo? Keigo is a kind of little fish. When I was young, I was a hot head. One time I challenged a boss. He said, "Eels always eat Keigo." Remember that. Soon after, this boss was killed by another boss. It's weird. The other boss's nickname was Fisherman. Eel... Boss! Nan! Nan, thank you. You managed the temple well. My pleasure. Goldie, you look prosperous. You've got golden hair. No, I'm not so prosperous. Hey, boss, Sawatdi Khrap! (Thai)­ Boss Gu, get some rest. We'll pick you up later for dinner. Doesn't Shaowu live with you now? Yes. Bring her to the dinner. It's not good to take a kid to...

Here I come. What's your name? Lulu. Cute. Hey, it's your song. What's your name? My name is Lulu. You're Lulu, and she's Lulu. Crazy. My name is Lulu, too. Uncle, to your health! Just drink the juice. Shaowu's toasting me. That makes me want to drink. Boss, I'm jealous. Jealous. Tell me who is cuter than Shaowu then! Miss Coco is the cutest. She's the prettiest. Dreamer, don't put Keigo on the spot. I'll drink to that. Shaowu, they're all guys. Do you feel awkward? No. It's fun. I'm old and I don't like noise. You know what I like doing the most now? Going to drinking houses. So you know about drinking houses. Let me tell you, I don't love drinking houses. I love fishing. I love fishing, too. Where do you go fishing? I used to go to Fong River with Keigo. If I didn't go, I wouldn't feel right. Hey, let's drink. Shaowu, don't be jealous. I won't steal Keigo from you. You're always in his heart. One day you will know. Where are you going? You were quite rude last time. Damn, answer my question! What's that attitude? Ninth grade, hah? F*ck you, hands off. What's your name? Shaowu the Bad. What, the Bad? Shaowu the Bad. Did she say the Bad? F*ck your dad! You'll be sorry if you do. Why will I be sorry? Who's your dad, huh? Let's take a look. Give it back. Go away! A cell phone.

Here! You're a disgrace! Who started it? I did. Did Shaowu tell you who she is? She said she is... Shaowu the Bad. Did she mention me or Boss Tigu? No, she didn't. So I... Boss Keigo, if Shaowu mentioned­ Boss Tigu or you,­ and Min still wants to fight,­ I'll give her a good beating. Okay. It's all good. Okay. We're all friends. Min knows it's her fault. Thank you, Boss Tigu. Min, go ahead and thank­ Boss Tigu and Boss Keigo. Boss Tigu, Boss Keigo, thank you! Guo, it's okay. Excuse me, we're leaving then. Come back and drink tea with us. Okay. Thank you. Keigo, come over and have some tea. Shaowu the Bad... Being a parent is just like being in a gang. Do you know how? Sometimes it brings joy,­ sometimes it brings trouble. Are you trying to be profound? My point is it's expensive to maintain a gang nowadays. Business is tough. Video Games, gambling, and prostitution­ don't make money anymore. Yes. Our life is tough. We've gotta change the way we're doing things. Boss, what are you thinking? Drugs... Never mind. You're still the same­ after all these years. Have some tea. Boss, I have a girl to raise,­ and my friend wants to open a restaurant with me. That sounds great. Shaowu, we were looking all over for you. Why should I need to tell you if I'm right here? Hi, I'm Sam. I'm Min's cousin. She has a short fuse. Don't be mad at her. Hey, who has a short fuse? Flirt with her if you want,­ but don't insult me. Sorry, I must be going. Shaowu, sorry about last time. I didn't know Boss Keigo is your dad. It's okay! How's your head? Oh, it's okay. But you really hit hard. I am so sorry. Where are you going? Going out with friends. Be home early. Okay. You're wearing makeup? Yes. Don't go to weird places. Okay! What's that supposed to mean? On the left! The blue one. It's new. Stop him. This is killer! Stop playing! That's obscene! Stop him. What're you doing? Shaowu, how about this one? No. It's too dark. Another one. This one, it's grey. It looks good. No, no. This one is better. It has more color. Why does it also look lame? Shaowu. Hello, Miss. Hello, Mr. Chen. Hello, Miss. Have a seat, please. Thank you. You don't smoke, do you? No. Mr. Chen, this is a routine visit for school. Sure, Miss. Have some tea. Thank you. What do you do? - I... I'm... - in finance. What kind of finance? - It's... - Loan repayment. Miss, if Shaowu behaves badly at school, you should punish her. We don't believe in punishing students anymore. Shaowu is good. She's quiet in class. As for her performance, it could be better. She's smart. Okay. I will make her work harder. Miss, I want to thank you with a little gift. I can't take this. It's okay. It's nothing. Please take it. Shaowu, the long weekend is almost here. Do you have any plans? I want to take a trip with Keigo... with my family. Anywhere specific? Yeliu. That's good. I look forward to your travel diary. Shaowu writes very well. She tells good stories. She wrote a story about a killer. It's very dramatic. What, a killer? I just made it up... Did you really give her a diamond watch? Is that a problem? She must have been surprised. I don't think so. Did you buy it? I bought it from a friend's pawn shop. It was a bargain. I'm going back to Kuala Lumpur next week. He's finally agreed to the divorce. He didn't give you a hard time, did he? He's been giving me a hard time for years. He finally stopped. Boss Gu! Keigo, have some tea! Thanks. Please forgive Dreamer for screwing up. Boss, if you ask, it is done. Thank you, thank you. Keigo, tell Dreamer to behave. Be more respectful. He won't screw up again. Captain, really sorry about Dreamer. Here. Have a cigarette. Let's close this case. It's all good now. Keigo, we are family now. Will you do your best­ for Boss Tigu's new business? Chang, I never seen such a dirty cop like you. I must go. F*ck, what is it? What am I going to do about Dreamer then? Why do you want me to wear a hat? Your shaved head makes you look mean. It's called Yamamoto Style. Stand here. Look here... look here. Smile. Lower down. Right. Look up a bit. Here, here. Look here. Shaowu, happy birthday! Happy birthday! Shaowu is 15 years old now.­ Thank you! It's your first birthday with us. To your health and happiness. Always young and pretty. Thank you. - Let's sing Happy Birthday. - Okay. Ready? Sing! Who is it? A birthday bear! Thank you! - You okay? - Yes. Keigo, sorry. - How did you find out? - You are so sneaky. You should have told us it's Shaowu's birthday. Facebook notified us. "Death" book? That's too serious for a birthday. - No, it's Facebook. - Shaowu got an FB account? - Yes. I added her. - Did she add you? Yes. She didn't add you? Okay. Let's sing. Quit the chit chat. Yes. Let's sing! Ready? Sing! ♫ - Happy birthday to you…­ - No one told me it's Shaowu the Bad's birthday. Boss Gu. Such a small cake…­that is why you didn't invite us. Boss Gu, have a seat. Shaowu, it's good someone told me about this. Here you go. Happy birthday. Thank you! Keigo, what's wrong with you? You look upset. We can't do business together,­ but we are still brothers, no? You're right. Happy birthday to you... Ready, ready! Okay. 1, 2, 3! 1, 2, 3! Whoever loses, it's their treat. And you lost! I didn't lose. You lost. Don't push me. You lost but you won't admit it. Was it yummy? Yeah. Rain... Could you do me a favor? What favor? Keep this for me. I can't smoke at home. If my dad sees this, it'll be game over! Why did that guy bring you home? It's nothing. You have a boyfriend now? Come over here. Come over here. You are in high school. It's too soon to have boyfriend. Right? I don't have a boyfriend! Give me your bag! Come on! What's this? Your friend takes drugs? Kneel! Why? Get down! Do it! The old-time bosses thought drugs are the lowest. I agree with them. I'd rather be poor than deal drugs. Why? Because of this. Stay away from that guy,­ and Min! Min didn't do anything wrong. Min is a bad influence! Your friends are all criminals! Don't you talk back! What's wrong with you? You want to be like me? A nobody. Yes. I want to be like you! I have a tattoo, too. A tattoo? You have one. Why can't I? You can't because I say so! Why can't I be like you? Keigo cares about you. That's why he's so mad. If you were Dreamer, Keigo would beat you. I've been with Keigo since I was your age. He gave me lessons every day. When I was younger, he would beat me. He used a bat... Boss! Shaowu's still upset. Go talk to her. Dreamer, take out the empty bottles. Empty bottles? Did I scare you today? I didn't do it on purpose. I was worried. Scared. I thought you weren't scared of anything. After you came, I started to get nervous. Do you regret letting me come? I worry about you. You don't need to. You want to be like me. How can I not be worried? Keigo, you mean more to me than anyone. Who else can I learn from? It's not about learning. You're my flesh and blood. It's in you. Keigo, you look good in your hat. Really? Shaowu, why didn't you talk to me today? What's this? Work hard and soon we'll be rich. Boss. Boss Gu... I found this in Shaowu's bag. What? In Shaowu's bag? I'll look into it. No need. We're done. Keigo! Keigo! You want to quit because of this? Boss! Dreamer, Goldie, if you want to deal drugs,­ we'll be strangers. - Keigo. - ­Boss! That's it. So...The Yeliu trip was our first family vacation? Yeah. Why did you ditch us in the hotel? Where did you go? Don't ask. Please don't do it again. Okay. Yeliu... I haven't been back­ since we went there. Keigo, look! Don't put your head outside of the window. It's dangerous. Keigo, Keigo. Let's take a selfie! 1, 2, 3! Do you have so many friends? No. One for Grandma, one for Jade. Who're you writing to now? I'm writing to myself for the first time. The current me to the future me. I hope the future me is as happy­ as the current me. Do you want to write one to yourself? No. My handwriting is bad. It's okay. I won't laugh at you. You're already laughing. Let me write for you. Who would you write to? Coco? Don't be rude. It's Miss Coco. Keigo, if Miss Coco gets her divorce, will you marry her? You ask so many questions! It's important to me. I probably won't. Why? I have you. Keigo is right. This is a bad idea. It's too late for regrets. Let's call it our last deal. Okay? Okay! This way. You hit us. What the f*ck! Move forward. I can't back up! Get out! Stop the engine. What a coincidence. - Get out! - Get out! F*ck! What's this? Out! Out! What do they want? Crap! - What the f*ck! - Over here! Search time! Come on! Motherf*cker! Don't move. Out! What's that? Motherf*cker! What the f*ck are you doing? Easy. F*ck you! Look in the trunk. It's heavy! It's a big one. Bingo! What's this? Laundry detergent. Tough, hah? I said I'd get you! And I did! Like a cat catching mice. It's too easy! What're you looking at? Where are their car keys? These are your car keys? Nice cell phone? You're doing great! Motherf*cker! Release them. Can't wait to see the sh*t hit the fan. Let's go. F*ck! How could we be so stupid. F*ck stupid. We better look. How? Jump off the bridge? We're dead. Sh*t, they set us up. F*ck! No answer. Boss, Goldie's a big gambler. Seems like he lost a lot. Could he have taken the drugs and run? Boss, it's worth 70 million. What do we do? Did you give me my name? Yes. Why am I named Shinwu (Heart Dance)? Because your mom loved dancing. She must have danced well. No, she was a terrible dancer. Even I dance better. She said­ she would give birth to a great dancer and that our daughter would dance for me. Don't stare at me. I can't dance. What a waste of your name. Didn't you say you dance better than Mom? Dance for me then. I was just better than her and I haven't danced for a long time. Dance, please! - Do you really want to see? - It's too easy! Okay. Introducing Keigo. I'll do one that was... very popular when we were young. The Robot. Okay. Let me warm up first. Robot goes backward. Cheers, Chairman Wu! Thanks for coming! We've overstayed our welcome. Excuse me. - Sakura, take care of them. - Okay. What happened? We're in trouble! What trouble? What trouble? Don't do something stupid. Chang. Do you need money? Sis... if there's a chance, we'll come back to see you. Let me call Keigo. Sakura, we're closing early today. Robot answers a call. How could you do that in the middle of a dance? Police! Turn off the music! Don't move! We heard there are drugs in this bar. - Hello! - Don't try anything funny. Search! Captain, you heard wrong. It's impossible. Coco, this is routine. Sit down and rest. It's okay. Ah, look who is here? Why do you love me so much? It's fate. We always run into each other. I found them. It's true then. Who's the owner? No way! Whose is this? Whose do you think? Keigo's. It's mine. What a dirty trick! Don't do this. You're in deep shit. Shaowu, let's go back to Taipei. You treated me to a beer last time. I'll treat you back today. That'll be fair, don't you think? Goldie, will you take care of my grandpa? And you take care of my grandmama. You're laughing? Keigo, why are we heading back? Dreamer! Dreamer! F*ck you! F*ck! F*ck! F*ck you! D*ckhead! Okay. Okay. Still going fishing? Yes. I can't go back now. Please don't go. It's not like I want to. If I don't return, go back to Kinmen. No. I'll go with you. No! You stay home. Do you know what's on my tattoo? What? The Wind Lion God holds a fish,­ a Keigo fish.
