Hello? Hi, Mahitab. It's all fine. I took some iceberg lettuce. Breadsticks without sesame. Wholewheat bread. Lunch meat with green olives and pistachio. There's no need for the plain one. Last week half of it rotted. I got a 5 kg pack of Basmati. And I got chicken mortadella. The one made of breast. It's all right. Listen, I'm almost done here. I'm at the cashier. If you need anything else, tell me. Ok. Bye bye. THE ORIGINALS He scares the stars of Arab pop. Even the great Amr Diab. Women who listen, stiffen. Any man, would sicken. He's the king of melody, I mean seriously. Samir Aliwa! Samir. Samir. Samiiir! What? Why don't you answer when I call? What's wrong? Unbelievable. My friends shared pics from Hosam's party. She lost weight! She went to the best dietician. Dalia tagged me in the summer's pics. I look slimmer. Yes, I can see. You really are thinner. Well done! Look at that! I see. Cook us dinner. Order some pizza. You got it. Pizza? Ok. Chicken. Hello. Good evening. Mr Samir Aliwa speaking? Yes, it's me. October 193, Trees compound, flat 2. Yes, Sir. Would you like to try our mushroom pizza? No, I'll have the usual order. So 4 large pizzas, 3 super chicken, Yes. - A veggie pizza, a big salad, 4 Pepsi. - Exactly. - Anything else? - My veggie pizza... - Without carrots. - Yes, without carrots. Thanks. You never do anything useful. You're always on your iPad. It's a phone. It's pointless. Did you order the pizza? Forty-five minutes. Hello? Good evening, Mr Samir. Hello? Hang on. - Hi, dude, how are you? - Fine. I've got a surprise for you. I was filing some papers in the villa of a lawyer. I found the archive of "Al Ahram" nwspaper from 1900 to 1919. Really? How much? 5000 pounds. How come? I bought the 30s archive for less. Newspapers of the 1919 Revolution are rare and sought after. Ok, Gamal. We'll talk later. Bye bye. Five thousand pounds for old newspapers? At least if you read them, I could say: he gets cultivated. It's the 1919 Revolution papers. The history of Egypt. This history will bring us mice, the kids will sell it when you're dead. Spare us. Watch out, the next instalment for the chalet is in two days. I planned everything. I'll get a bonus for an audit closure. Pizza is here! - Good evening. - Good evening. Thanks. - How much? - 287 pounds. One minute. Thanks. Keep the change. Hello? - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. I'm Randa from Zone Phone. Hi, Madam. We're updating our customer database. Are you Samir Aliwa? All right, Madam. ID 2030119700142 Exactly, Madam. Born in Heliopolis district, 15 Nozha Street, 3rd floor, apt 9. Landline 0233052228 Current address: 6th October, 139, Trees compound, apartment 2. Yes, Madam. Go ahead, please.

Great. Thanks a lot, Madam. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Did you see the newcomer? - I noticed her. It's her first day at work. She's from Maady area, 36 years old. She has a Mercedes and a fit body. Single. She looks single. Guess what? I heard she’ll join your department. Just for once: make me proud. The HR office asked about you. It's your lucky day. A promotion and a pretty colleague. - Sorry if I'm late. - Not at all. - How are you? - Fine thanks. - Have you had a drink? - Yes, a Nescafé. Good. Did you meet our new employee? No, I didn't notice anyone. An experienced credit manager. She's done some great work, all the banks speak about it. I grabbed her before she was snapped up by another bank. It seems that women in such positions are very tough. Maybe it's their hormones, Or their inner femininity... The social pressure, harassment... They want to establish themselves. You know what? Presidents in some countries have female body guards. Yes, I feel that women have taken control. Mr. Samir. There's a small problem. God forbid. Unfortunately the bank decided to dispense with your services. My services? Have I done anything wrong? Not at all. Your last performance evaluation wasn't good. Evaluation? My performance was outstanding, according to last year’s figures. By the way, that’s not what I think. It's the new manager's decision. He saw that the salary balance is very bad. So he decided to change our policy. They want new blood on lower salaries. I won't lie to you, but I'm afraid of what's coming next. New blood? Sir, I served this bank for fifteen years. We owe you two salaries, following your notice of dismissal. You will receive them together by staying happily at home. Plus, you'll have a bonus for each year you worked here. We will state that Mr Samir Aliwa resigned from his job. No, I'm sorry, Sir. I refuse to be treated this way. In this case, we will do it the official way. We will dismiss you. And you will sue the bank. The case won't be examined for a year or more. At the end, you'll get the same compensation that I'm offering now. Minus your lawsuit expenses. And Mahitab? Who is Mahitab? Will the new credit management employee take my place? Unfortunately, yes. Samir. As soon as you fill in and sign application 6, you will get your end of service check. The bank offers you also a simple gift, for your long years of service. Trust me, it's not the end. It may be a start. Simsim! What's wrong, my son? Unbelievable. If your dad was alive, he would never have let this happen. You must sue them. Sue them? If dad was still at the bank, they'd have dismissed him too. In 15 years I've never seen anyone winning a case against the bank. All banks wish to have the son of Mahmoud Aliwa. A Jesuit school alumnus, a ping-pong champion. Why do you worry? Ping-pong? I have a family to look after. Tell me, does your wife know? She doesn't have to know that you've been fired. Please mom. I mean your unjust dismissal. If she knows, it will be a problem. She just needs to see you leaving and coming back every day as usual, And bringing her money for her huge expenses. When you got us married, didn't you know she was a shopping addict? How could I know? I met her mom in Mecca, after your dad died. They seemed austere, like all Muslim pilgrims there. We all dress like each other. I just wanted to settle you down. How could I know she's such a spendthrift. But it's also your fault. You should have taken control. Anyway, you have your dad's bonds, and the land at the Oases. That's in the desert. I don't even know where. Simsim. I don't want you to despair. Where's your ping-pong champion spirit? I'm fine, mom. I'm fine. Why did you cut the okra? I told you just to trim the stems. You haven't cored the zucchini? - Show me the rice. - Hello. Hi Mahitab. You overdid it. Where is the vermicelli? AL AHRAM NEWSPAPER ARCHIVE 1900 - 1919 -Hi, Tarek. - Hi, Samir. - How's everything? - Fine, thanks. I wanted to tell you some news. - What happened? - I decided to quit the bank. - Why? - I'm fed up. I need something new. If you stumble on a job offer, please tell me. Of course, I will. Thanks a lot, Tarek. Keep me in mind. Good bye, dear. Hany, how are you, my friend? No, who told you I was fired? That's not true! It's just rumors. Why should I be fired? No way. Do you think there might be a position at your bank? Of course, I will send you my CV. Of course, I will send you my CV. Bye, daddy. Bye, honey. - Bye, dad. - Bye, dear. Sabry, how are you? I thought about the job you offered me years ago. So... Is it gone? Seriously? Well, if you come across anything else, tell me. Thanks Sabry. Good bye, my friend. UNLOCK WITH YOUR FINGERPRINT Good evening. Did anyone leave a box at my door? No one. Shall we make a report? No, there's no need at all. Hi, good evening, mom. Did I wake you? Mom, have you kept the old videos of me as a child? No. Sometimes I long for my old memories. Just that. Sorry, mom. Sweet dreams. - Hello. - Zone Phone speaking. Your name, please? Samir Aliwa. Let me check your data. How can I help you? I wanted to ask if you sent me a phone as a present? No. Presents are delivered in store upon ID approval. Anything else? Thanks. Thanks. What's wrong, Mahitab? What are you doing? I finished and I was spending some time alone. What's the problem? Where's your salary? Your wallet is empty. I need the money tomorrow. Tomorrow. They will audit the balance and pay us. I'll see the doctor today to schedule my surgery. You still want that liposuction? Why don't you exercise? Exercise? Spend two years at the gym? If you go everyday, it'll take less. Enough, Samir. I told you it's not liposuction, it's stomach stapling. Did you get an iPhone? Yes, an iPhone. I want it. For what? The bank gave it to us and set up our emails on it. I see. If they do it again, count one for me. Sure. Who is it? Hello. Hello. Who are you? Where did you get the videos on the phone? I can't tell you on the phone. We have to meet. Why should we? As bankers say this could be your dream opportunity. I could report you to the police. As you like. You have my phone. - By the way I... - Slow down. A rushed answer could cost you a lot. Think about it, then send the word "BAHIYA" to number "0". - BAHIYA? - Yes, a female name, like "Saniya". Send it and I'll call. One last thing: keep this secret between us. Don't tell even your mom. BAHIYA A lovely morning to you! Good morning. Sit down. Have a seat. Please. Is it you? The phone owner. May I know who you are? Your older brother Roshdy Abaza. The dead actor. Now you are kidding. There's no kidding here. Just similarity of names. What are those videos? Your beautiful memories, Samir. They're fake. I've seen this a lot in soap operas. When truth is hard to believe, we say it's fake. Between you and me, isn't what you saw in the videos true? Isn't that what happened? Even if it was true, where did you get them? From those who love you and care for memories that get lost. Because we don't record them. What people? Are you an investigation officer? No, no. State security? No, no. Intelligence? Then who are you? I am someone who appreciates your skills and your history. Unfortunately you devalue yourself. Have you a 5 pound note? What? A 5 pound note. Here. Thanks. - Thanks, dear. - Thank you. Let's take a walk. Come. You see, Samir. Let's say it's time to help you free the giant inside you. What giant? Who are you? We are the originals, Samir. - The originals? - Yes. Those who truly love this country. Not those who pretend to love it. Now I get it. No, sorry. I won't be a spy. I will never sell my country. Wait. What the hell are you saying? The spying issue is old-fashioned. Listen, Sir. If you don't tell me now who you are, I'll go. - We're the spirit of the Nation, Samir. - Excuse me? The spirit of the country. Its original guardians. Will you let me explain? You know, Samir, It has been scientifically proved that if mankind suddenly disappeared, Nuclear reactors would explode, dams would fall, diseases spread. Then nature will take over. In 43 years, Earth will be back to its original state. As if mankind had never existed. Are you an insurance agent? No, Samir. I'm an agent of the pure land. When systems malfunction, and the country collapses, we appear. We cannot be seen, but we appear. Our job is to keep the scale balanced and bring reality back to its flow. I don't get it. I'll explain. - You surely know about Cain and Abel. - Of course. Great. Who did Cain, the evil brother, kill? Abel, the good brother, like you. - Thank you. - I mean it. In this story, Samir, there's someone missing. A person who doesn't want to be mentioned. Who is he? It's the guy who got Abel's revenge on Cain. We are the sons of that guy. We were faithful to that cause. May I ask you something? Go ahead. How does this relate to me? Why have I been spied on since my childhood? Who hasn't, Samir? - Seriously? - Of course. God Himself, glory to him, imposed on every human being two angels to watch us and never leave our shoulders. God from Heaven watches his servants. Praise to Him. We are just humans imitating Him. Are we? We spy on ourselves before someone else does. We don't want to wash our dirty linen in public. What linen exactly? You haven't had breakfast. Let's get a bite. One veggie pizza. Not too spicy. With a lot of mushrooms, but no carrots, and a Diet Pepsi. Anything else? - Bring me the usual. - Sure, Mr Roshdy. How do you know I don't like carrots? Samir! Samir! May I know what exactly you want from me? I came to offer you your dream opportunity. I came to take you from the queue of people who eat, drink and sleep. Who keep old newspapers of no use. To the army of men who God has chosen to be the eyes of the country. I don't think you can refuse to protect your country? From what? From its lost children, Samir. Those who kill their motherland. Those who want to migrate and leave the country in distress. Those who don't know the National Anthem. But I am a banker. What can I do? Why do you underestimate yourself? Samir, you are an Egyptian. Egyptians are the smartest people ever to exist. Haven't you noticed, Samir, most of our Economics graduates, they work in restaurants, and excel at it? Engineers work in politics. Not every mind can do what we do. Your life mission, is not the bank that exploits you, nor the acres your father left. Tomorrow Samir, when after a long life, you die, you must have left your trace. You mustn't be someone who lived and died. No. With us, Samir, you will be effective. Influential. Why me? Because you have the spirit we're looking for. The original spirit of the Nation that always stands by your side. Always. You're one of us, Samir. I have a question. How can I be sure you're not an impostor? Samir, I told you we have lived with you for years. We are your life companions. We know your fingerprint, your blood type, your shoe size. Samir, we don't want anything but your own good. Got it? With us, you'll get a substantial salary. As much as your old one, and more. With us there is no retirement. Our mission is lifelong. - May I ask something? - Go ahead. Are there videos of my intimate moments? What? I haven't done that very often. Shame on you. I respect your private stuff. It's a household secret. I kept them apart. - Apart? - Anyway... Think thoroughly about this. If you agree, send me the word... - BAHIYA. - No. "BAHIYA'S EYES", to number "0". Yes. Your five pounds. See you, Simsim. Bye. Bye Laila. Thank you. How are you, Laila? How is it at the Faculty? Peace. It's fine. No boyfriend? I'm joking. Listen, Laila. Would you like daddy to be a hero? What? A superhero? Like Spiderman or Batman? No, not like Batman. I mean a real hero. An army officer. A sports champion. - A secret agent. - Seriously? Ok, if we live in America, like every superhero, I'm in. No, I mean an Egyptian hero. No superhero could live in Egypt. Why do you say so? Of course he could live here. What are you saying? Come on, daddy. Well... As a credit management director at the bank, am I a hero for you? A management director? Of course not. - Really? - Never mind. If I were a hero, but secretly, without you knowing, would that do? Daddy, did you watch Batman yesterday or something similar? No, honey. I didn't watch TV yesterday. Whatever. Can we talk seriously now? Seriously? Of course, go ahead. My visa card is not working. I tried to use it and it didn't work. I want to buy many things online. Ok. We will go to the bank. Thank you, daddy. YOUR BALANCE IS ZERO Hello? Good morning, Magdy. How are you doing? I'm fine, thanks. How about you? Thank God. Magdy, why is my balance unavailable on the ATM? What? They withdrew the instalment? They could've taken it from the insurance! What rules are you talking about? My balance now is zero. That's a disaster! Ok, Magdy. I will sort it out. Good bye. Today, only one of the competitors will win with us. Today only one will help our country to be Number One. Today there will only be one hero. Let's welcome our first competitor. Samir Aliwa. Samir, why don't you order a pizza? Ok. Haven't you finished the dishes? Do them quickly and leave. BAHIYA'S EYES God bless you, Sir. God give you prosperity. Mr Roshdy. - Hi, dear chap. - Please. My friend, our country at dawn is amazing. I agree to your offer. Congrats to our new hero. Simsim, you're on Facebook, right? - I am. - Great. Your account will be closed and we'll open another for you. Starting tomorrow, you will receive your new job. With "Zone Phone" network for mobile communication services. Mobile? But I don't know anything about communication. As if you've ever known anything about banks. Congratulations, Samir. Communication engineer? These certificates are fake. Shut up. They are authentic. Look carefully. The authenticity of these papers doesn't make me a communication expert. Look Samir. An original Egyptian, if tossed away by the sea, he comes back in a boat bearing his name. Only if he is original. Like you. You are one of the originals. - Hi, Mr Roshdy. - Hi, man. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Fine. - And the kids? Fine, thanks. Come in, Samir. - Please, close the door. - Sure. Come in. You're most welcome. Welcome. Come in. Come in. Are you ready? What's this, Sir? This is tamarind. You'll love it. This is our contract. This is an advance for your job. Hello? Good morning, Sir. Good. Everything is going awesomely. I beg your pardon. The one who fails or retreats now, he will counted out. At your orders. I'll do all I can. That's obvious. We're in a critical situation. As you wish, Sir. Be reassured. Our eyes never sleep. Take care, Sir. Good bye. We are in a difficult moment, Samir. There's no time for hesitation. The train of the Nation doesn't stay. If anyone calls, we will say... The train of the Nation... Yes, Hima. Good morning, dear chap. This is what the song will say. If anyone calls, we'll say: no way! The train of the Nation doesn't stay. Is it nice? Really? Can I have it tonight? Fine. I want it cheerful and joyful. With a lot of violins. Ok, my friend. Good bye. What do you think? I really like it. I like the lyrics a lot. Ok. Go ahead. Time is precious. Congrats, Samir. Am I hired? Come tomorrow to the company at 8 o'clock. Beard shaved. - Shall I wake you up? - No, I'm used to it. Excellent! - Bye, kids. - Bye, dad. - Good evening. - Welcome. Samir Aliwa. I have a meeting with HR. Wait a minute. - Mr Samir Aliwa? - Yes. Come with me. Mr Samir Aliwa. Come, please. Good evening. How are you? Have a seat. My goodness! You have great experience in networking. I mean it. You studied PMP. And CISSP. And MCSD. And MCDBA. Who in Egypt has them all? Thank God. Yeah, thank God. What was your job in Germany? In mobile telephones, the German way. You studied "spooter" in Germany. It was the first thing we studied. There's nothing called "spooter". You're an impostor. Abdel Wadud. Come here now. No, Sir, I thought you said "scooter" and I was just... Yes, Sir. See what he'd like to drink. What would you like, Sir? Milk tea. Sure. Got you! I really got you! I scared you stiff! - You look awesome when you're scared. - Yeah. - You were great. - Thanks. Thanks. Oh my God! Don't worry. The spirit of the Nation. But milk tea... Don't you know that milk tea destroys brain cells? So I won't have milk tea. Please tell Abdel Wadud to cancel it. - Congratulations, employee. - Thanks a lot, Sir. - After you. - Thanks. Mr Samir. From here. After you. Sorry, it's my wife's number. I'm sorry. Please. Close the door behind you. This place... ... Not one of the company directors knows about it. When am I supposed to learn the whole job? It's very simple. Unlock the screen with your handprint and access anyone's phone. Anyone. You can listen to all phone calls, live and recorded ones. You can access any microphone even if the phone is off. And the camera of the phone, the computer, any camera. You can follow anyone on GPS. You can open any account on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. - Did you see Snapchat? - I did. Did you see the kitties? Snapchat is so cool. I'll give you some important instructions, then I'll go to work. - Focus, Mr Samir. - Sure. First. It's forbidden to talk to anyone about our work. Second, the information kept here is at the service of the Nation. It must not be used for personal purposes. Third. As we see screens, screens see us. Let's be careful. Fourth, daily working hours are 8. Eating in the room is forbidden. Your predecessor once ate in here. He spilled tahini on the keyboard. The motherboard crashed. It was German, not local. - Oh no! - Be careful. When you leave, unplug everything. If the electricity is cut off… Don't say it. I lost a fridge like that. You see. When am I supposed to start? From now. Today, get acquainted with the place and wait for a phone call. Ok. - Take care. - Thanks. Hello Samir. Searching for: Bassem Morsi Aly. Sir, the Minister said we need 20 billions... Of course not! If they saw us, it will be a scandal! You're laughing? I'm not joking. I hate bad manners... This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. There's no God but God. Oh my God! Isn't this marvellous? What are they saying? It's a Sufi chant for protection from the devil. Satan? Can you believe that Satan is the first silent cell of life? Oh my God! Could anyone have imagined, that a creature dwelling among angels, a true flying angel, could have turned radically against the Highest? If God wasn't watching, what would he have done? Humans are miserable, my friend. Otherwise what's the use of our guardian angel? God knew that Satan would disobey. Of course. Obviously. When he caused Adam to eat the forbidden fruit, God knew it. God's mill grinds slowly, But surely. Praise to Him. Oh God. Here, Mr Roshdy. - God bless you. - Thank you. Do you like your office? - Is it nice? - It's awesome. But I don't know what exactly I must do in this office. -Soraya Galal. - Who is she? Soraya Galal, 33 years old, daughter of a diplomat. An Oxford graduate. PhD in Civilization Trend Analysis - What? - Civilization Trend Analysis. Useless Western stuff. Anyway... From today, Soraya Galal is your mission. Treat her like your sister. No need to say more. Listen to her carefully, and report everything. Like what? - Food delivery calls? - No, the delivery service is ours. - Is it? - Of course. You want to know a man's nature? Study his eating habits. You will know how many persons live with him. But that's a job for other staff, our job is much simpler. We listen carefully, and report everything. Important comments, weird details, what is between the lines. Everything. How many people are tracked like Soraya Galal? Everyone is being tracked. 90 million? No, we just care about 54 million. We've got only 50 million covered, alas. 50 million, alas? Have you hired a whole Nation to watch us? Sorry. I will explain, Samir. Look. We are almost 90 million. The active class is aged from 15 to 60, the rest are kids and old people. The active class equals 60% of the total census. That means 54 million persons. Alright? If every watcher follows 4 persons and their circle of relationships. How many watchers do we need? You need 13.5 million watchers. Tell me, what company could hire such a large number of watchers? That's why we say we help each other. Like brothers, we help each other by watching each other. I apologize, I don't quite understand. Anyway, from now on, Soraya's phone is your phone. I want you to record everything with attention. I want you to know her surroundings. Her friends, her lovers, her emotions, her dreams. You will be her guardian angel. What does she look like? Beautiful. Blue blooded. God forbid. Are you going to make me sin? Most importantly, we always ensure that the watcher never meets the watched. It's better for you, and for her. Ok? Let's join them. Excuse me, I don't like dancing. It's not dancing. Come purify your soul. Good Heavens! Searching for: "Soraya Galal". TV hidden camera. Soraya is unavailable now. Wake up. How can you be so lazy? I can't believe you're still sleeping. I went to sleep at dawn. I hope it's something serious. I miss you. That's serious. I miss you too. Where are you? I'm home, having breakfast. Why don't you come? I said I went to sleep at dawn. What will you do today? The man from Luxor, Abdel Sattar, called me and asked for a huge sum. You asked him something huge. If he gets caught, you'll be next. And I won't be able to help you. I will confess your name before torture starts. It's the drug that all Egyptians will buy. You've gone nuts. Don't mock me. It took me a lot to get this idea. Sleep well, so you'll get it quicker. It's an amazing discovery. The Romans will sue you. Let them. I've always felt there was something fishy. Our people have had too much hash and fava beans. You're right. Now stop lazing around. I love you. I love you too. - You also do good coffee. - Yes, Sir. SORAYA'S BOYFRIEND IS CHEATING ON HER Soraya Galal's laptop. Personal photos. Voice recordings. 15 March. I saw a program about chimpanzees. It brought me back to Kenya. I miss the smell of the rain. Swimming naked in the ocean. Crying when forced into a swimsuit. I never believed I was a girl. 19 March. Kenya rises in me every day. I remember Sako's kiss, and my disappointment the day after. Why didn't he tell me it was our last day in Kenya? No chance to say good bye. He would be my age now. 1 April. I remembered the "Jambo Wana" song. All that nanny Alona taught me. I listened to the song. I looked for Sako on Facebook. I know I'll kiss him if I saw him again. 29 May... 1 June... 14 February... I was created from strength. I'm the first. I'm the last. I'm the saint I'm the prostitute. I'm chastity and I'm lust. I'm the wife. And the virgin. 8 June. The flamenco class. I remembered my trip to Spain. When I danced it for the first time. I moved as if I was learning how to walk. Until I got my red dress. I was spellbound. I'm the mother. And the daughter. I'm the sterile. And the fertile. I'm the spouse. And the spinster. I'm silence. And the idea. 15 February. Daddy brought me a valentine. A scooter and a helmet. I wonder if a time machine made me meet this man in the 70s. I would have clung to him. Such a romantic man is a waste in my mother's hands. I'm the word, the scream and the wit. I'm madness. Madness... Today Argentine is playing Germany. I hope they lose. So that jerk will be dismayed. Argentine reminds me of him, and his football passion. I don't know myself. He wasn't the most handsome guy in Argentine, maybe the best loafer. I'm knowledge. And ignorance. 19 April. New York airport. 3 pm. Daddy is dead. I can't understand that word. As if it was another language. His soft voice telling me the story of Isis and Osiris when I was a kid. I'm life. And death. I'm order. And chaos. Today someone hit my car. I felt he hit me. I've been crying for hours. The tears I kept for my father. I started to forgive him. Even if he never came into my dreams. 23 March. Today I met Ramy. A commercial photographer. A funny guy. His eyes remind me of Daniel. I need to break the wall within me. Daddy and me in Spain. He was dancing with me. We were dressed like cinema actors, In an old film. It was a wonderful dream. The forests of Kenya. I don't know what reminded me of them. I run naked as I liked to do there. I can still fell the leaves of trees brushing my skin. I wish I was a Shakespearean heroine. I wish I was... the fairy queen, Who fell in love with the poor peasant. In "A Midsummer Night's Dream". A horrible nightmare. I saw Ramy kissing a girl. I shouted and he slapped me. The pain woke me. I dreamt of giving birth in the forest. I delivered a beautiful gazelle. Like Bambi. Then I saw the seven dwarfs watching me from behind the trees. One of them had a mobile... I'm shyness. And clearness. I'm strength. I'm fear. I'm war. I'm lust. I'm peace. And chastity. I'm trespass. I'm paradise. Mommy please, I won't marry unless I feel ready. And you're not, right? A marriage without love and passion is a deadly tedious routine. Its children are misfits who curse us. Life is full of things beyond marriage. What about Ramy? An established photographer, and married man. A divorced man, mom. He's building himself. No, he's busy with a commercial. Why should I hurry? There's no hurry at all. Stay alone, until I die. You're saying such bad things. You provoke me, you're acting silly. Hello! Hi Madam. I hope you're fine. We found what you're looking for. Is it it, Abdel Sattar? Of course, Madam. We know better than archaeologists. But we need some more dough. I paid a lot. It's what it's worth. Let me see the stuff first, then I'll pay. Ok, Doctor. Wait for my phone call. Bye. Bye. Where are you? Still on set, honey. Won't we dine together? Give me a couple of hours. You're kidding. I know. Even if I come, I'm not in the right mood. The client is demanding, and the model is a bore. Ok. Don't be upset. Book us a place for the gig in the weekend. I'll see. Please, don't be upset. Listen, go to sleep, we'll meet tomorrow. Can we? I love you. What's wrong, Samir? What are you doing? Kissing you. Wait a moment. - Dance for me. - What? I'm kidding. What's up? Get dressed and come, now. I'm hardly undressed. Where to? Qursayah Island, in half an hour. But I... No buts, half an hour. What's wrong? The bank safe was robbed. Get on. Welcome. What urgent issue made you get me out at this time? Simsim. Our work is a priority at any time. It's written in the contract. Let's go. What's that sound? The siren. The siren? Each time I come close to the water I hear her calling. Roshdy. Roshdy. I went crazy, Simsim. I went nuts. I was told by the islanders, she's a siren. A fairy living in the water. When she sees you, she calls your name. She keeps calling and you approach, closer and closer, and then... What? No one has survived to tell what happens. Oh God! No, I didn't shut up. Nor did I believe this masquerade. I went after her until I found her place. I got a cheap recorder from a shop. I left it recording all night long. What did I find? She is an old woman from the island. A fortune teller and a spell breaker. By night she calls the name of one of the islanders. Until he goes crazy and hires her to rid him of the siren. The day after, I broke into her place. I slapped her in the face and she confessed. Then she stopped calling my name. Really? So who is calling my name now? It's her. But you caught her! It's an old woman who makes a living. God bless you. Sometimes she informs me about the islanders. Come in, Samir. You're very welcome. Sit down and tell me, how is Soraya Galal? She's been calling a certain Abdel Sattar, from Upper Egypt. He's bringing her some ancient stuff from a tomb. She's waiting for his call when he's got the stuff ready - Great. - Her lover knows about this. What else? She says every Egyptian will buy this type of drug. And... her lover cheats on her. One moment. - Her lover cheats on her. - Yes. That's crucial. - Is it? - Of course. There's no one more dangerous than a person suffering for love. Passion is the first step toward madness. The brokenhearted is like a time bomb. Ready to explode. - Explode? - Yes. One who is shocked in love can't speak. Soraya Galal will soon be shocked by her lover. Suddenly she will want to vent her anger. In this case, she may go in for politics. She may join protests, throw petrol bombs. While she's unaware that she's a victim of love. All this for love? An unloved lover is an unbalanced person. She will search for her balance by any means. You've loved once, right? Tell me, don't be ashamed. I'm your older brother. Feel free. I went through something similar long ago. Like what? It was a short love affair. Are you embarrassed? Why should I be? Or are you hiding it? No, what could I hide? Heba? How did you know? Samir. Sorry. She's a good person. A well-bred girl. She fulfilled her dream of becoming an interior designer. Imagine, Samir. How could you know how she is now, if we stayed unaware? She still thinks of you. Really? She always talks about you with her best friend. She tells her about the day you took flowers to her at home. You Casanova! It's your mother's fault. She separated you. She'll pay for it. I don't really wish that... This is the thing I regret most in my life, Sir. Your mom? No, me, because I obeyed her, when she declared Heba unsuitable because she isn't a neighbour. Did Heba...? She didn't marry. I'll let you meet her when we're finished with Soraya. When is it supposed to end? Will you arrest her and the smuggler? Arrest who? That's not up to us. See, Samir. Everyone has a dark side. Sooner or later, it will be revealed. I hope it's just antique smuggling. - Keep recording. - Sure. You do a glorious job, your name shines in the Nation's history. Thank you, Sir. - Take this. - What? Tell your wife we're sorry. Don't be shy, man. We all need a little help for that thing. Three days of wild sex. Abdel Sattar, the great man of the South. He changed our meeting place three times. He pissed me off. I'm frightened, but determined. Where are you? I've been waiting long. I met Abdel Sattar. You're crazy. You met him alone? Everything’s fine. It’s is in my bag. I'll tell you everything at my lecture tonight. I'm not sure that I can come. I need you tonight, a Cambridge expert is coming. You will be amazing, I'll come next time. I need to talk to you a bit. Is there a problem? No, just to chat a bit. Next weekend we'll be together until you're fed up with me. Why are you silent? Don't worry. You will do well. If we look back, we can see we’re a lucky generation. In the last decades we cured the worst diseases. We invented cars. Planes. We discovered nuclear energy. We built satellites. We walked on the moon. We invented computers, mobiles, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Distance disappeared. We came closer to each other. Much too close. In a few years we'll have everything. And I mean "everything", through the internet. Isn't such a world, ideal? Isn't it? But it went wrong. It all started with the 2008 economic crisis. Countries were bankrupted. We fell into depression. Anxiety became the second most common disease. Revolutions, wars, Poverty, starvation. Refugees. People became afraid of the world they created. It had to stop. A voice called for a return to nature. Let's see why temperatures rose. Let's stop eradicating trees, and hunting whales. Let's go back to the tree of our creation. We're all sons of Adam. We need to meditate. Away from mobiles... It's a serious issue. How are you? You've been listening from the start. She's great. We must go. We have a meeting. We should be dressed with images of seas and trees. We shall go back to nature. To an ancient civilization that was exporting something different. A wonderful story, with an odd end. We'll see in my next lecture. I didn't mean to meet Soraya. I wanted to approach her and get a clearer vision of her dangerous ideas. - I see. - I managed to get more details. It's smuggling antiques and drugs. She talks about a drug for everyone's use. I'm surprised, in my first case I've tracked a smuggler's network. - Antique smuggling isn't dangerous. - Really? Look. Sadly, foreign museums keep our antiques better than us. The real problem is here, Samir. Most of those who rebelled, were the marginalised. See Hitler. He was an art teacher, before founding Nazism. Yes. That nice bearded guy whose face is on every young man's car. - Who’s he? - I don't know. - Che Guevara. - Yes. He was a doctor. It means everyone is a suspect. Until proved otherwise. Do you like her? Who? Soraya? Not at all. Apart from the antique smuggling that is not dangerous... She's a nice girl, she likes dancing... A cute girl, but I don't like her. I see. Best of luck to you there! - Isn't it awesome? - It is. - Hi, how are you? - Hi, Mr Roshdy. - These people are very nice. - Yes. Listen, I attend this Feast with them every year. - You come to this Feast every year? - Yes. Are you a Christian Muslim? What? Religion is for God, the Nation is for all. That's true. You don't like swings, not those who push them. - I'm a grown up. - Have you ever been on it? Hi! You got out of jail? How are you? Welcome back. May you behave properly. Come Samir. A repentant thief. He's a good guy now. This way. Welcome. Come in, please. Welcome to Samir. - Take it easy. - What's going on? - What is it? - Easy man. - Roshdy. - It's all fine. - What are you doing? - Don't worry. They're all nice, really. How are you? Easy. They're all amazing, but I prefer this one. It's beautiful. - A tattoo? - Take it as vaccination. What the hell? Who told you I need it? Why Samir? Why did you see Soraya without permission? I meant to tell you. Wrong answer. What if the angel on your shoulder, forgot to note a detail. Do you think... Of course he'll be pardoned. Just once. Why this tattoo? To remind you of our deal. Our mission is to observe. Just that. We get orders, we execute them. A clear white line, that we shall not cross. What is he drawing? If I'm one of yours, why am I tracked? Your colleagues too love the country. They all know that love is dangerous. Most people were lost for love. The person you love most could be a traitor. See... Knowledge hurts. But it relieves us. From what exactly? I don't want to know anything. Not even about your family? Would't you like to get information that could help you with their future? Look. Abel thought he knew Cain. The Pharaoh thought he knew Moses. Joseph thought he knew his brothers. If you wish to know more, start with your family. You will be amazed. Mahitab and the kids? I won't tell you. Let's go see the five-legged cow. Come on. Oh BAHIYA tell me who killed Yassin. Tell me who killed Yassin. BAHIYA. The story of BAHIYA. You're lucky. BAHIYA was a heroine. And the wife of a hero: Yassin. In 1905, Yassin stood against an oppressive feudal lord, Who seized his land, killed his father, and lusted for BAHIYA. Yassin and BAHIYA refused to surrender. They left and escaped to a cave. Yassin kept his thirst for revenge. He killed all the guards of the lord, and burned his castle. The only one who supported him was BAHIYA. BAHIYA who refused the lord, for her honour. She lit the fuse that triggered the rebellion of her fellow villagers, Against the oppression of the feudal lord. One day, they encircled the cave. They killed Yassin and took BAHIYA. From that day, people ask in their chants: Oh BAHIYA, tell me who killed Yassin. Who, Samir? Who would sacrifice like this, today? - Good evening - Hi, dad. BAHIYA What are you doing? What's wrong? A tattoo? - BAHIYA? - Yes. Who's this BAHIYA? BAHIYA... "Shun gazes BAHIYA, eyes may be evil". Excuse me? This isn't permanent, right? My colleagues at the bank engaged a very respectful tattoo artist. I gave it a try. At the bank? Were you at the bank today? Of course. Why didn't you tell me they fired you, and we have zero credit? I was going to tell you. I wasn't fired, though. We ran out of credit because of this useless chalet! When did you mean to tell me? When we have no money for school? When I have my stomach stapling? Why did you hide it from me? What disaster did you cause, to be fired? I told you I wasn't fired! I'm an honest employee. I can see it. Do you think you can hide anything? Samir, I want an explanation. Did you really quit your job? Daddy, just say it. Yes, they fired me. Are you satisfied? Yes, I quit my job and our credit is zero. I'll find another job. And I had a tattoo. And this doesn't mean you'll do tattoo too. Why Samir? Samir. - Don't close... - Shut up! Open! BAHIYA! You cheated me with the housemaid? Listening to: Omar Samir Aliwa. Hello! Let's meet at Khaled's at 8 o'clock. Bring with you the chemistry paper and the last grammar lesson. That jerk's giving me such a hard time. He bought one for himself, not for me. I found out he was fired. He even got a tattoo. Can you imagine, Bassem, how I feel now? How come that I, who used to party and travel, now live such a dull life? I will explode, and no one understands me. I wish I could drink, dance. I wish I could leave the house and go. Don't get me wrong, but I wish I was drunk, meeting someone new. I miss you Ramy. Fine. Me too. With or without clothes? I'm alone. I'll take the picture somewhere else, my dad is here. Good evening. Laila. Laila. Laila! - Yes, daddy. - Show me your phone. - What? - I told you to show me your phone. - What's wrong, Daddy? - I told you give me your phone! Are you hiding something? Some pictures? - Unlock it! - I won't! - Unlock it! - Samir, what's wrong? Watch your behaviour, dad! My behaviour? Of course. It's not because of you. It's because of the son of a bitch that didn't buy you a phone, right? Are you shouting at us, to cover up your misdeeds? I shout because our girl has grown up and hides things from her dad. Ask her what she hides in her phone. - Since when do we track Laila? - From now! And you, cool down. It's not good for your hormones. Or you will have to go to Dr. Bassem. To wash our dirty linen there. Very good. It's enough for us to bear your mess. Will you also vent your madness on us? I'll take the kids. We'll leave the house. We'll go to the beach house until you come to your senses. Come on, kids. So... Last time we said how oddly Ancient Egyptian Civilization ended. In a way which didn’t reflect its power and history. Civilization is not just monuments. It's literature. Art. Thought. Lifestyle. Our ancestors discovered that imagination is the key. In simple words, it's like the song: Sky is the limit. They cleared it out and looked at the Universe without sunglasses. With unlimited imagination. So they left us a civilization that we still praise till today. And they left us a key. Maybe we'll get it. You will find this key everywhere. On crowns, on their hands. On columns, inside tombs. This key is a blue flower. The lotus flower. This lotus was in a real tomb at the time of the 18th dynasty. It was inside a coffin. I analysed it personally to prove its effect. I may be arrested after this lecture. Ancient Egyptians used to sniff or drink it to free their imagination. To journey. Through their old unseen memories. Through the experiences of their ancestors, back to Adam. Can you imagine? A man who keeps the whole internet archive in his head. What would he be like? Egyptians started where their ancestors stopped. Lotus affects eerie parts of our brain. Science took ages to grasp why it existed. It's a gland. Big as a rice grain. With a very familiar shape. It looks just like the eye of Horus. It can't possibly be a coincidence. It operates with blue lotus and sunbeams to trigger imagination. You know we gave the world the Pyramids, Some astronomy, that makes no difference. You don't know we did much more than this. We gave the world conscience. A document guaranteeing ancient Egyptians justice, freedom, dignity. A law saving them from chaos. A law called: Maat. A beautiful woman with a feather on her head. She puts it on the scale of judgment, to make dead souls talk: I haven't stolen. I haven't wronged anyone. I haven't attacked. I haven't terrorized. I haven't committed adultery. I haven't mocked God. I haven't harmed animals. I haven't polluted the Nile. I haven't lied. I haven't stolen. I haven't raped. 42 questions to ensure each dead Egyptian deserved to be called human. Until the Romans came. As any invader, they had to destroy this glorious Nation, to control it. They started with the lotus. They eradicated it. They burned it. They must have forbidden its cultivation. Gradually, Egyptians lost their imagination. Their civilization ended. Karnak's columns collapsed. We forgot they used to say: Everything fears time, but time fears the Pyramids. Now, any questions. Is blue lotus considered a drug? No. I call it a tool that helped Egyptians lose their chains. It created a fertile imagination, that shaped their civilization. YOUR BOYFRIEND IS CHEATING ON YOU. HE IS WITH HER NOW. I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU. YOUR MOTHER IS NAGGING YOU TO WED. BE CAREFUL. YOU ARE BEING WATCHED. Since when you left sport, Simsim, You're stressed and messed up. Trust me, your mood won't improve unless you’re a champion again. Your father was the same, each time he left ping pong his life messed up. What are you saying, mom? Laila is dating a faculty mate. Mahitab calls secretly a hormone doctor. What will ping pong do? It's your fault. You don't know how to control them. The son of Mahmoud Aliwa, a ping pong champion! Please mom. Can you stop talking about ping pong? And you know what? I never liked it. Simsim. Don't say so. You were crying in the toilet, Whenever I forbade you to attend training. How did you know that I was crying alone in the toilet? Mom knows it all, Simsim. I've always been watching you. Mom made you an honest manager and a sport champion. A proverb says: he who wasn't raised by his mother, has no power. Come on. Come on, love. I will prepare your dinner. - Hi, Samir. - Hello? Samir, we know you. - Who is it? - The quality control team. We know that Roshdy upset you. He's an impostor, right? I knew it from the start. Don't worry, he won't do it again. For BAHIYA that's tattooed on you. We track you as well as him. Excuse me? We're separate institutions but we help each other by tracking each other. We're all the spirit of the Nation, Samir. Is Roshdy tracked? Everyone is being tracked. There's no hierarchy. We told you we control quality. Your comfort is our mission. Be assured. We are always there for you. Closer than you think. ROSHDY ABAZA BAHIYA YASSIN THE BANDIT WAS KILLED IN A CAVE BY THE POLICE Yassin an innocent kid turned into a bandit. He was known all over Egypt. One day he met BAHIYA. A beautiful girl. He loved her and so did she Who could have refused him? BAHIYA left her home to escape with him. She rejoiced for his hits against the poor and rich. Until the police was sent to arrest Yassin. Yassin was killed. BAHIYA lied and said Yassin had kidnapped her. When questioned, she confessed she was her lover. So BAHIYA was a whore. Everyone is being tracked. We are your life companions. We know every detail about you. We are the originals. The spirit of the Nation. The one who loves you might be a traitor. Abel thought he knew Cain. The Pharaoh thought he knew Moses. BAHIYA was a heroine married to a hero. We are the originals. I missed you Laila. How are you, honey? If you want to change and study cinema it's ok, it's your choice. How is Omar doing at school? Say hi to him, until we meet. How's mom? Of course, I bought it. With a pink case, as you wished. You're welcome. See you. Ok, mom. Ok. - Thank you. - Bye bye. Paradise lies under mothers' feet. - Yes. - But sometimes they exaggerate. You know, my departed mother until last year, treated me like a child. Even after I got married, I had children and I divorced. Samir Aliwa. Soraya Galal. Nice to meet you. What's your job? I own a small tourist village at the Oases. It totally relies on natural resources. Ecolodge. There are no phones, no internet, no TV, nothing. - You called it "The Blue Lotus". - Of course. I studied it. No way. This is my basic study. - Really? - Pharaohs... I'm a lover of Pharaohs. The Goddess Isis is like a mother to me. - Where do you live? - At my Ecolodge. I went to Germany to make an agreement with a group. Germans are particularly keen on this issue. Please, come to visit us. I would really like to. I'd also like you to come. - Can I have your phone number? - Yes. 0100... ...333333. - Can you miscall me so I save yours? - Of course. I can. I will call you from a landline, because there is no network there. - Where do you live? - At the Ecolodge. At some point factory-raised chickens catch a disease. It happens once. It makes them reckon the moment to escape from the farm. From that farm that, actually, has no fence.
