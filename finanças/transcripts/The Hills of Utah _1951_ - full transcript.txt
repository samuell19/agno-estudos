(Horse galloping) Gene: Long hours in the saddle, then here was the town. I found it shabby and run-down, the streets almost deserted. They always said this town was well-named: Coffin gap. And there was a killing a day to prove it. Killings that came from a bitter feud between copper mines out on territory road and the big cattle outfits along cabinet basin. The feud was still far from settled, slowly destroying the town I had last seen years before. They had saloons with oil paintings; the doorknobs of solid gold. They had famous opera stars and pianos which had to be hauled in over mountain roads. But if they’d only had a doctor, my father wouldn’t have died. This once was a proud hotel where I raced up in the ranch buckboard, my father beside me, badly wounded. I’d found him out on the range, a bullet through his lungs. I asked for a doctor, and I still remember the answer: Boy: Doctor. Man: That’s one animal we ain’t got. There never was a doctor in this town. Gene: I was never able to find out who killed him. But now, as I rode back into town, I was aware of the eyes watching me. Suspicious eyes, resentful of any stranger. The eyes of paid gunmen who ruled the town. What’re you snoopin’ at? We just wondered who was moving in. You oughta know. You run the post office. Well, I ain’t no information bureau. Now, go on. Do your snoopin’ someplace else. Nosy people nosing into everybody’s business. What’s the idea? He’s clumsy. He tripped over himself. Unh! I see a lot of clumsy people around here. Are you asking for trouble? Ohh. Did he hurt you? Why, you... Now--now, i’m not supposed to fight. It’s against post office regulations. I’ll beat your-- now, uh-uh-uh. Now you can’t hit me. It’s a federal offense. Now, the other fella hurt me. See? I’m bleedin’. Now, you ain’t supposed to hit a wounded man. Now, watch out now. Ohh! Ah, you see? Ow! Oh, did I hurt your finger? Let me get my mailbag. Oh, i’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do that. A fella could get hurt with these things. Now, on your way. You fellas better beat it, before somebody gets hurt. Hey, we make a pretty fair team. Just like salt and pepper. You remember me, boy? [Horse whinnies] I been keeping them at b.B.’s livery stable just like you told me when you sold the ranch. They’re just as spry as the last day your dad drove ’em. Ow! Does that arm hurt? Oh, it ain’t nothing. I’ll put a little goose grease on it. I think I got something better than that. Hey, that’s right. You been away studying to be a doctor, ain’t you? You can be my first patient, dusty. I don’t think we’ll have to operate. I’ll say one thing, gene. You sure picked the right town. Any first-rate doctor could make a good livin’ around here just patchin’ up bullet holes. I thought that feud would be over by now. Not the way them miners and ranchers keep pot-shottin’ at each another. Why, it’s gettin’ so it ain’t even safe to deliver the mail. Let’s doctor up that arm. Oh, speaking of doctors, did you see what I got you to help decorate your office? Is that part of your Indian collection? It sure is. This belonged to sitting bull’s own personal medicine man. Here, i’ll show you. Cures ’em every time. I can understand that. Anybody would be afraid to stay sick with that starin’ them in the face. What--what do you say’s the name of that stuff you’re puttin’ on me? Iodine. I never heard of it. Ow! It burns! Ow! [Whooping] Indian war dance? Yeah. The iodine tribe. Heap much squawk, not much hurt. Oh, hi, Karen. Gene, you heard of Karen McQueen. Her father owns the copper mine. Are you the new doctor? That’s right. I’m gene autry. What was it you wanted? My little brother’s sick out on the Ridge. Would you come? Sure. Be right with you. You mean little Duncan? Oh, that’s too bad. He’s been sick in bed for 2 days, and now he’s had convulsions. All right. We’ll go out and see what’s wrong with him. Don’t you have a gun? A gun? If you mean on account of them riders at the coronet ranch, I don’t blame you. If the ranchers ain’t shootin’ at the miners around here, the miners is a-shootin’ at the ranchers. And you better have a gun, ’cause you liable to be caught between ’em. Satisfied? We’ll take my carriage. I’ll see you get back. Yeah. Go on, gene. I’ll take care of champ before I go out on my route. I guess champ could use a little rest. I was riding him all day. I suppose it would have been too dangerous for your father to send one of the miners in after me. You know it would. I’ll drive. I know the road. Keep an eye on that office. I really didn’t think you’d care to go back with me. You mean because of that old trouble with your father? He has a lot of enemies. All the ranchers insist that the wash from our copper mines are poisoning their cattle. You have to admit a lot of cattle have died from copper sulfate poisoning. Of course, nobody’s told you how many times my dad has tried to work things out with the ranchers. We asked them to choose just one water course. Just one. So we could channel off the waste waters from the mine. But you know the answer. They always had an argument. And that includes Mr. Bowie French and his coronet ranch. He couldn’t afford to lose a few acres of his precious grazing land. But, then, of course, I shouldn’t say that, because bowie French is a friend of yours. He rode a couple of years for my father. He taught you how to use that gun. Bowie’s of the old school. He always said a gun was more important than a branding iron. Not such an old school. Hello, Evan. So, they’ve got you working for the coronet? Didn’t think you’d remember me, gene. I see you have a new saddle-mate. Ingo Hubbard. Tells me you gave him a little trouble back in town. What do you men want? Oh, nothing important. Bowie French would like to talk to you, gene, before you go up on the Ridge. I know what he wants. You can tell him this fight’s between you and the miners. I’m not takin’ sides. He wouldn’t like you going up there, gene. It’s my job to take care of the sick. Whichever side they’re on. Now, if you’ll move that tree... Get out of here! [Horse neighs] Unh! Uhh. Watch his gun, ingo, watch his gun. [Gunshot] That’s right. Keep yours where it is. Next time, you’ll deal with bowie. Give him my message: That feud’s none of my business, but it will be, if he tries to block any more roads. Good thing I told you to bring that gun. That’s one habit i’m going to get into. I think you better do the driving. They make you nervous? I--i didn’t say I was. [Whistles] Giddy-up! Hello, washoe. Hi, gene. How’s the rheumatism? [Coughs] Not good. I can’t even go to the mine. They got me doing the cooking. I wouldn’t try to go in, Karen. Your father’s got himself barricaded. Says he’ll shoot anybody that comes near the house. He’ll let me in. [Gunshot] Dad, it’s me! Jayda McQueen: I can see who it is. I’ll shoot anybody that tries to bring that doctor in here. The worst part is he’s so capable of it. That’s what I was tellin’ you. My brother’s dying, and i’m going in there. Isn’t there some other way to get in the house? Well, we could go through the main shaft of the old test tunnel that comes out in back of the house. You could try it, I suppose. I know the mine. I’ll go with you. You keep Jayda at the window, and if you let him know what we’re up to, you won’t have a job past tomorrow. Count on that. This way. [Gunshot] Stay back there, washoe. I hit what I aim at. Crazy fool. I pulled him out of a mine shaft 20 years ago. Drop that rifle, Jayda. I should’ve shot the both of you out there. I’m surprised you didn’t. Karen, I won’t have you gettin’ that doctor in here when I told you not to. The boy don’t need one. Your daughter says he’s having convulsions. You could at least let me examine the boy. I don’t trust doctors. You ain’t touchin’ him. Oh, yes, he is. He’s in that bedroom. Now, you come with US, where we can keep an eye on you. My own daughter. I am your daughter, and i’m capable of just about anything you are. Go on, washoe. Find out what’s going on. You in here, too, washoe? A man’s house is supposed to be his castle. [Coughing] Uhh. Uhh. There ain’t nothing wrong with him. Any kid gets a bellyache once in a while. It’s more than that. He’s delirious. Has an intestinal obstruction. Ah, don’t give me none of them big words. In other words, it’s like a drain stopped up in a mine shaft. Is this what you been feedin’ him? Fried meat and potatoes? 3 times a day. Been eatin’ it all my life and ain’t never been sick. Ain’t that right, washoe? Healthiest food there is. But this boy don’t work it off with a pick and shovel. His stomach swelled up, and it’s gonna get worse. So far advanced, he’ll have to have an operation. Oh, no, you don’t. Nobody’s gonna go butcherin’ my kid. Say, what did you come back here for? Who you tryin’ to square accounts with? I came back here as a doctor. You may think I came back for something else. Yeah. I got my own ideas about that. My father died. I can’t do anything about that now. But i’m not gonna stand here and argue while this boy dies. Karen, we’ll have to have some hot water and clean linen and a sponge for some chloroform. Chloroform? Gene: Here was a hurry-up job. My first operation without some hospital surgeon standing at my elbow. A hundred things might go wrong, and this was the one time I didn’t dare make a mistake. Not when i’d once been a rancher, and these miners believed I was here to even up old scores. I had doubts. Plenty of ’em. Yet, all I could do was hope. But one thing I knew: There was no stoppin’ now, despite the growing fear that the operation might be a failure. [Whistle blows] Whoa. Hiya, fellas. Hiya, Mr. McQueen. I guess I got what you been waitin’ for. The latest issue of t he miners digest. It always was your favorite. Washoe, heh, heh, heh. You’ve got another letter from that widow. Now, don’t think I been reading your mail. I can tell by the perfume. [Sniffs] Romeo’s delight. [Laughing] Well, what’s eatin’ this happy crowd? Did the mine blow up or something? Hey, where’s gene? He didn’t give Duncan the wrong kind of pills, did he? He’s operating. Ought to be finished by now. Operating? You mean juggling dynamite with a blow torch. Dad, he’s all right. He’s going to be fine. Well, now, that’s wonderful. Better let him sleep. He needs the rest. If you say so. No more meat and potatoes, washoe. I’ve given Karen instructions. Nothing but milk and soup until further orders. No solid foods, you understand that? Yes, sir, doc. We’ll take care of him. Hey, you can ride back to town with me, gene. I only got to deliver 3 more letters, and some mail order catalogs. That’s all right with me. [Coughs] I’ll drop out tomorrow and see how he’s getting along. Ha. He’ll be all right. See you later, gene. Drop in the office, i’ll give you something for that cough. Thank you. Didn’t I tell you that boy’s got an iron constitution, just like mine? How about you driving, gene? Might be a kick handling the old team again. If I don’t slide off the seat. Well, it slopes some, but it’s steady. Whip ’em up quick, gene, in case that kid don’t snap out of it. Maybe they should’ve sent for sitting bull’s medicine man. Well, at least he’d have better sense than to carve up a customer in the enemy camp. Hanging up the shingle, huh? How does it look? First-rate. And you sure earned it, too. That Duncan boy’s getting along fine. Seems to be. I was out there again this morning. Hey, I got a present for you. Had it made up special. See, it’s got room for all your medicine equipment, so you’ll have it with you all the time. Well, that’s mighty nice of you, dusty. This will come in handy. Aw, shucks, it ain’t nothing. I’ve been using your father’s buggy team, ain’t I? Just think of all the feed bills i’ve saved. I’m going to make the rounds this morning, i’ll just try it out. Hey, you ain’t going out to mud flats, are you? Mrs. Jeffries is a pretty sick woman. Why not? Well, the mayor was out at mud flats this morning, and he give all of them families 24 hours to clear out. And I just asked the mayor for a hospital, the one thing this town really needs. Heh. Won’t do no good to ask the mayor about that. Bowie French runs this town. Him and the cattle owners. It’s about time I paid bowie a visit. You know, I was just hoping you’d say that. Hello, Evan... How’s the stomach? Not bad enough to need any of your medicine. Is bowie in? Yeah. Yeah, he’s in, but not in the mood for company. Don’t tell me he’s sick. Heh. Everybody in this world ain’t sick, just because you’re a doctor. Go on in if you want. I’m not stopping you. You know, ingo, someday I might make you wipe that up. [Laughter] Bowie! Bowie! Anybody home? Nola. Wedding ring, huh? Not you and bowie? You seem surprised. I’m more surprised at the coronet. For an outfit with so many cattle, I expected more in the way of the home ranch. Bowie won’t spend a dollar he doesn’t have to. You know how he is. Always that fear of poverty. Guess he can’t forget the old days. I understand he don’t want company, but i’d like to talk to him. I wouldn’t, gene. But it’s very important. [Knocks] Bowie. Go away. Well, gene is here. He wants to see you. Tell him to get out of here. Not going to throw that in me, are you? [Thud] Get that half-breed out of here before I... Shoot her out. What’s the trouble, bowie? I’m in the deepest, blackest bog you ever pulled a calf out of. Somebody cross you? Yeah... You did. Why did you do it, gene? Why did you go up to Jayda mcqueen’s place? I’d go anywhere anybody needed me, whether it’s you, McQueen, or anyone else. But you know what jayda’s done to the range. Poisoned our cattle. Half a dozen ranchers have been forced to give up and close their books. You haven’t done so bad. I knew you when you only had one horse to ride. Now you’ve got so many, you have trouble picking out the one you want. Dr. Autry, arm chair philosopher. Gene, I never thought i’d have to tell you this, but you know how much I thought of your father. That worked both ways. Well, after you left, I tried to get a line on who’d killed him. Not much to go on. A few high-line rustlers then, but nobody believed they’d done it. I didn’t need much else, except that talk. What talk? You don’t really know, do you? No. I don’t know. Well, I guess it all started after you left. Do you ever think that maybe... Jayda could’ve killed your father? The feud hadn’t even started then. Gene, you’re a cattleman, born to it, and you still don’t even know which side to be loyal to. You could help US. That kid’s going to need attention, and you’re the only doctor within 100 miles of here. I’ve been a-waiting for a long time for something like this. Something that would bring old Jayda down off that Ridge. I told you this was your fight, not mine. My fight. I never thought i’d hear that coming from you. Here I thought we could be eating our beans off the same plate again. You’re not giving it very much of a chance. No. And from here on, I don’t intend to. Stubborn fool. He thinks i’m supposed to do anything he tells me. He ruled the valley long time, gene. Yeah. And look what he’s done for it. Men killed, families driven out of mud flats. You know, I was going to ask him about a hospital. I didn’t even get around to it. Bowie has a way of twisting people. Never mind, Nola. I’ll find some way around it. Gene: ♪ here comes Peter cottontail ♪ ♪ hoppin’ down... ♪ Mayor Donovan, he’s done it. He gave his room to that sick Mrs. Jeffries. Well, why didn’t you stop him? Stop him? I’m no gunman.

That’ll cure coughs, colds, warts, and falling hair. All the aches of the human body from the cradle to the grave. Must be powerful stuff. Well, Geronimo used it until he was 79 years old. It’s probably what killed him. The Indians have some fine remedies, but I think we’ll stick along with the regular injections. [Knocking on door] Oh, I forgot to tell you. They sent for the marshal. Marshal: Open up, it’s the law! This woman’s getting out of here. The rent’s paid. What law are we breaking? Endangering the public health. I ought to jail you for this. Don’t make me use force. Mind if I give her an injection first? Well, no, but hurry it along. What are you looking at? Looks like a spot. You feeling all right, marshal? Yeah. Sure I am. Why? Just wondered. You remember that epidemic a couple years ago? People was dropping over like flies. They could’ve used a doctor. This isn’t serious, though, with the right treatment. You know, it does feel like I might be getting a little rash. How’s your heart? Oh, all right, I guess, why? Let’s have a listen here. Say, does it always pound like that? Huh? It sounds like a freight train. It does? Say, maybe you ought to give me one of them injections, just to make sure. Might be a good idea. Fill this up, dusty. Here you are, doctor. You know, I didn’t want to say it, but I have been feeling kind of snaky lately. Well, just wait until you get this. Gene, Duncan has died. Jayda is down off the Ridge, gunning for you. Well, there won’t be any shooting if I can stop it. He might be here any minute. Any minute? I just remembered I got a lot of work to do at the post office. Heh. Sure piles up on you, don’t it? Can’t understand it. The boy was all right. I was just out there yesterday morning. Can’t understand what happened. Jayda needn’t find you. Not if you don’t want him to. But i’ve got to see Jayda. I have to find out what went wrong. If there’s time to ask questions. And there won’t be. Gene, the stage driver just seen him out on territory road. That was about 4 miles out. Thanks. [Horses galloping] Whoa. Ranchers spotted him traveling the back trail. I’d rather handle it my own way, marshal. But jayda’s like a madman, in such a rage, you couldn’t even talk. Come on! Man: Hey, gene! This boy’s looking for you. Hitched a ride in on a freight wagon. What’s the trouble, son? Sounded like another case like Mrs. Jeffries’. My mom’s sick out at the ranch. I’m afraid she’s going to die. Well, don’t worry about it. We’ll get right out there. Dusty, take him out there on your buckboard. But, gene, you’re not leaving. Not now. This has got to come first. Go ahead, i’ll be right with you. Come on. Karen, what are you doing-- I wanted to see it. I wanted to be here when he killed you. But what went wrong? What happened to Duncan? He’s dead. Isn’t that enough? I can’t understand how it could’ve happened. Couldn’t have been an infection. Wouldn’t have set in that fast. I don’t know what it was, but Jayda was right. You came back here for revenge and you got it. You know that isn’t true. Do I? Dusty: You ready, gene? I’ll open the gate for you. Dusty: Hey, where you going? I thought somebody wanted a doctor. Somebody’s going to need one. Hey, whoa! Salt, pepper, hold it! Whoa! It’s Jayda! [Horses whinny] Ohh, here they go! Help! Whoa! Stop it! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Gene, I can’t hold ’em! Whoa, there! Help! Gene! Gene, hurry up! Help, help! Gene! Anybody! [Crash] I tried, gene. I tried to hold ’em. I know you did. [Gunshot] That Jayda must be out of his mind. [Gunshot] [Gunshot] Jayda! Jayda! Jayda. Listen to me! I didn’t kill Duncan. Now, you killer. Now, we’ll see. [Clicks] [Gunshot] Throw it in the water, Jayda. Saw you was kinda pinched in down here. Thought you might appreciate a little help. Just like rustlin’ days, huh? If you’re gonna kill me, get it over with. Nobody’s gonna kill you, Jayda. He tried to kill you. Let him go, he’ll try it again. Put that gun away. I’m gonna fix his leg. You ain’t touching me. You won’t get very far with it bleeding that way. I don’t want your help. What are you thinking of? He tries to kill you and you want to doctor him. If I hadn’t’ve been here as a witness, you’d have finished him off. You didn’t think i’d miss, did you? Gene, gene! Gene, gene, they got me. I’m done for. [Whimpers] I saw it, it’s only a flesh wound. It’s--it is? You mean, i’m ok? And I thought it was letters edged in black. Heh. That’s just like a pardon from the grave. Gene, I gotta know. If Jayda asked you, you’d go back up there again. Up on the Ridge, I mean. Yeah, I guess I would, bowie. I was a fool for trying to help you. From now on out, you and I are riding opposite sides of the street. And by all that’s holy, don’t let me catch you on my side. Woo-ee. If he told me that, my next mail route would be in alasky. With a dog sled. [Hammering] Gene: During the next few days, pat got himself a bright idea. He knew I wanted a hospital for the town. So, he decided to do something about it. He had those tin cans in the strangest places, everywhere you turned around. [Coins rattle] In fact, he probably came up with the first parking meters anywhere in the country. The response was fairly good, but coffin gap was still a long way from having its own hospital. Then, one day he asked me to meet him at the closed-up gambling hall Matt Tracy used to run. I wondered just what he had in mind. What’s this surprise you’re telling me about? Come on, i’ll show you. Pat: You said this old gambling joint would make a good hospital. If we could raise the money. That "if" is the tough part of it. There you are. 2 year lease, signed and paid for. You haven’t been robbing the mails, have you? What do you care? You want a hospital, don’t you? Takes money to run it. We have to have beds, medical supplies... We’ve got all of that, too. The works. Look, you haven’t been collecting that kind of money out of those tin cans. We got ourselves a backer. That’s the surprise. Watch. You’ll need nurses, too. I’m sure I could learn. Nola, don’t think i’m not grateful. But I don’t think you know what you’re doing. But it’s my own money. My father owned cattle the same as your father did. You know bowie would never approve of you giving money for a hospital. He doesn’t have to know about it. [Laughs] In this town, he knows what the marshal has for breakfast. But you said yourself, the building isn’t for you. It’s for the people who are sick. Gene, about them medical supplies. We gotta send back east to Chicago for ’em, and if you’ll make out a list, we can get the order off on the next stage. Thought of everything, didn’t you? Yeah, just wait’ll you see one of the decorations I got for the surgery room. From custer’s last stand. And it’ll come in handy in case you run out of chloryform. You’re due for congratulations, bowie. Yeah? What is it? For giving them that hospital over in town. Ha ha ha. Who says I did? The word’s got around. Everybody knows who the money came from. Nola? How would you dare do this to me? Gene used to be your friend. You sneaking little savage. You want them to laugh at the name of bowie French, is that it? Is that what you want? I wanted the hospital for the people who need one. I grubbed for my money, rode through blizzards, tore my hands with rope burns. Crawled through mud to save a 2-dollar calf. And you do this. You do this to me. There’s a stage coming in today, loaded with their medical supplies. Get what men there are in the bunk house. If we don’t stop that stage, they’ll be laughing the coronet off the range. Bowie! You can’t-- if you’ve got any reason for wanting to stay alive, be gone and out of here by the time I get back. Gene: ♪ how I yearn to just return to Utah ♪ ♪ back to the mountains that I love ♪ ♪ where the piñon and the pine ♪ ♪ tell me everything is fine ♪ ♪ and the Utah moon is shining up above ♪ ♪ oh, my heart keeps hankerin’ for Utah ♪ ♪ to be ridin’ down that Utah trail again ♪ ♪ where the brave ute shot his bow ♪ ♪ not so very long ago ♪ ♪ and I know that Utah is my journey’s end ♪ ♪ oh, my heart keeps hankerin’ for Utah ♪ ♪ to be ridin’ down that Utah trail again ♪ ♪ where the brave ute shot his bow ♪ ♪ not so very long ago ♪ ♪ and I know that Utah is my journey’s end ♪ Wonder what’s wrong with her. Come on. Gene! They’ve gone after the stagecoach, bowie and his gunmen. Oh, there go our medical supplies. They cut across to the stage road 20 minutes ago. Come on, dusty. Now, just a minute, doc. Remember, I am the marshal. Gene: I’m sorry, but i’m in a hurry. Now, ain’t that too bad. I knew there’d be trouble over this hospital. Now, wait a minute, marshal, you’re getting all excited. Did you ever think of your blood pressure? Well, yeah, sometimes. Why? I’ve seen him keel over, sometimes right in the saddle. You better wait inside for me. Yeah, I guess so. Too much excitement right now wouldn’t be very good. Hey, wait a minute, you. What’s bowie up to? This is a legal, swore-in posse, and we’re going along. There’s nobody stopping you, if you can ride fast enough. You got a passenger, Sam. Rio’s going with you. What’s the matter? Trouble with bowie? He just fired me, that’s all. Well, I wouldn’t be surprised any, a man with his temper. We got quite a load here, but we’ll get your saddle in someplace. Put it on top there. You can ride up front with me. [Horse whinnies] I’m sorry, Sam. We’ll stop ’em for you. Come on, rio. Now, we’ll lose the cargo. Without a witness. [Both laugh] Yah! [Bowie laughs] [Glass breaks] [Glass breaks] [Glass breaks] Why don’t we try the ranch? That’s where we’ll find bowie. Now, take it easy, marshal. Remember your blood pressure. Just like you said, marshal. Bowie’s probably home at his ranch, asleep in his hammock. [Glass breaks] [Gunshots] Evan! [Gunshot] Whoa. [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Gunshot] Shall I wing him now, marshal, or you gonna take him in to jail? Ah. Stay where you are down there. Couple of you men, go down and pick him up. I’ll just stay here and keep a bead on him. [Gunshot] [Gunshot] [Gunshots] Wait till he comes by. [Gunshot] Well, i’ll be dogged! [Chuckles] Gene: Two hours later bowie’s gunmen began gathering outside the new hospital where Evan fox lay critically wounded. Bowie’s trigger-happy cowpunchers from the coronet and the other ranches: The scizzor’s brand, the cocked hat, the lazy b. They were all here waiting to see whether their friend Evan lived or died. There was nothing I could do for him. Or even try to do. Washoe’s rifleshot had done too good a job. Gene. Well, he lasted longer than I thought he would. Hmm. [Whistle tweets] Excuse me. One side, neighbors! U.s. Mail comin’ through! Watch it! Look out! That’s all for Evan. He’s cashed in. Get bowie. Indian sneeze powder. If we drop it from the roof it will really get rid of that mob outside. Then we will have them all in here shooting. Gene. Look out here. Bowie owns a lot of land. A lot of cattle. He bought them through the land company. Mayor Donovan doesn’t own it. Bowie does. And a lot of their deals wouldn’t stand investigation. What are they trying to hide? I’d have sold the ranch, anyway. Wouldn’t you have wondered if you knew bowie was buying up everything? Bowie, who kept the feud going when nobody else wanted to fight? So it was bowie who killed my father. Or had him killed. It was that fear of poverty driving him. Forcing him on. We’ll teach those miners to kill our men! It’s a showdown. They’re heading for the mine. I’ll have to warn Jayda. Dusty: His daughter Karen, you mean. Heh heh. Still water runs deep, don’t it, Nola? I’m sure it does. Gene: Bowie and his gunmen are headed this way! [Horn blowing] Bowie and his men are coming here to finish it. Well, jayda’s sick. He’s in bed. Jayda: I ain’t that sick! Let ’em come. I’ll take on the whole pack of ’em. Dad, give me that rifle! Get one of your own. [Horn blowing] [Gunshots] Here’s one, special delivery! [Gunshots] [Gunshots] [Shoots gun] The mine.

[Gunshot] Aah! [Gunshot] Washoe! It don’t matter now. Now I can tell you. I was afraid Jayda would kill me. Gene: What are you trying to say? It was 2 days after you operated. Duncan was a-cryin’ and pesterin’ for food. I-I couldn’t stand to hear him crying, so weak and feeble, like that. But you had orders. [Coughs] I-I murdered him, didn’t I? Now i’m paying for it. Gene: Maybe not. Ha ha. Any miner knows when the vein is pinched out. [Gunshots] Gene. Come out of there or i’m coming in after you. Come ahead! [Gunshots] Washoe. Come back here! [Gunshot] [Gun fires] Get back! [Shoots gun] All right, Nola. Let’s have the chloroform. [Laughs] Where’s that doctor? I don’t know what we’re going to do with this patient of yours. He just won’t take those pills you gave him. Don’t need any pills. Never had a sick day in my life. Did you ever hear of a miner who wouldn’t take iron? Iron? Well, I guess they couldn’t be too bad, hmm? [Whistle blowing] Sounds like dusty. [Whistle blowing] [Whistle blowing] Gene, I got a patient for you. You remember them injuns who just moved in down at mud flats? Well, you gotta fix this ’un up, real quick. He’s their medicine man. [Horse whinnies] [Whinnies] Well, what’s so funny? Didn’t you ever have a tummy ache? Well, can’t a medicine man get sick if he-- [whinnies] Medicine man sick. [Laughs] You’re getting smarter all the time.
