Well, you sound like a great crowd. Um... we got a couple empty seats out there? Or are some of you dressed up like chairs? You know, I was gonna wear a costume, since it is so close to Halloween, but then I thought, you know what, people already have a hard enough time recognizing me, so... Hey, we got a great show for you tonight. Stay where you are. We'll be right back. Top story tonight is a tragic one. Moments ago, late-night talk-show host Jack West was found dead in the living room of his Hollywood Hills home, the victim of an apparent murder. ♪ she came, she came to meet a man ♪ ♪ she found an angel ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ That's right. Who's not Jack West, huh, you little bitch? Who hit the home run? Yeah, you did. That's right. Okay. It's about 12:08 A.M. I have the subject in sight. She's blond, very attractive. Um... she appears to be having... Sexual intercourse with a man who looks a hell of a lot like Doug Wade, the third baseman from the L.A. Dogs. Subject is very limber. Very, very limber. $300 million, huh? Two outs, bottom of the ninth. He's working it. He's got a full count. Everyone's on their feet. And here comes the pitch. It's a long fly ball... no, it's a home run! Oh, my god! Sexual intercourse. Boy, that brings back memories. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. You're 17 years old? That's correct, and I'm gonna be 18 in two months. Chavo, can you believe he's 17 years old? You know, Jack, I-I would not card him. Yeah. Yeah, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but you're an old man. Looks like the nursing home needs to tighten up its security. Two years ago, I was living in a trailer. I had no job. I was seriously in debt, and I weighed 98 pounds. But look at you now! That's right, look at me now. Now, I live in a 10,000-square-foot mansion in Beverly Hills. I have a 1959 Aston Martin, and I make more money per week than most people make in their entire lives. That is remarkable, J.P.! It is remarkable, Dana! But you know, we all possess a skill to magically transform our lives into our wildest financial dreams. All you have to do is put it to work! Hi, I'm Preston. In two short weeks, I went from being in the poorhouse to having more money than I knew what to do with. How is this possible, you ask? All you have to do is follow J.P. Zahn's simple step-by-step instructions. It's that easy! Order now and receive this limited-time offer of just $39.99 for the complete set of J.P. Zahn's "remarkable power." Remember, you're in charge. You're in control. Ma'am, step away from the body. Come on. Let's go. Get out of here. Okay, folks, just when you thought you've seen it all, these guys have been touring all over the country. Incredible band. They're really making a lot of waves, just signed with universal records. Nice hand for mini rockers! Thanks, fellas. Thanks for being on the show. How you doing? I'm doing great. Thank you very much. So, now, how does it feel to be the shortest rockers in the country? It's amazing, Jack. Who says you got to be tall to rock 'n' roll? You guys are doing quite well, too, right? Very well, Jack. Our bodies might be small, but our bank accounts sure aren't. Did I read somewhere that one of you is dating Paris Hilton? We all have, Jack. She just hasn't figured it out yet. Well, I want to see that video. They're pulling the plug. Again? Yeah. It's for real this time. Ratings have dropped far too low. What makes you think my audience cares about ratings, skip? Well, Jack, unfortunately, the network does, and so do our sponsors. I'd suggest we get some better guests, but we can't seem to book anybody since you started this freak-show thing. So you're saying that my audience would rather see another intellectually challenged movie star than a 70-year-old kid or some miniature rockers... is that what I'm hearing? Don't forget the 100th-generation prostitute. The direct descendant of Mary Magdalene. Hello, can anyone say "brilliant"? You could bring on Jesus Christ himself, Jack, and people would still rather watch Brad Pitt. What about the hot seat, then? Jack, that's just what we're talking about here. You can't be dropping your guests through a trap door just because you don't like what they're saying. Well, I can if they deserve it, and besides, I've told you this before, it would be the audience's call... they would all have little buttons. Jack. Haven't you ever seen "the gong show"? Jack, people want to see stars, okay? Not the all-grown-up child actor of some "bonanza" rip-off. The name of the show was "sizzler." "Sizzler," right. Look, I'm sorry, pal. But unless some miracle happens, we are closing up shop after Friday's show. In this series, I will teach you how to discover the hidden powers of your mind. Let's start with what I call the simple steps to success. Step one... power over people. Do you have an important job interview? Then listen to me very closely. When you walk into that room, you are in charge. You are in control. Hey, listen, Mr. Vega, I want to thank you for having me in, and I want to say that I firmly... have a seat, Ross. Take a load off. Okay. Thanks. Yeah, like I was saying, I firmly... take ahold of this. That knife can cut right through bone. I have had that knife eight years... I have never had to sharpen it. How much do you think the average housewife spends on knives in a year? Over $2,000! Now, do you think the average housewife and her husband would appreciate spending a fraction of that and never having to buy another set of knives as long as they live? You bet your life they would! You see what I'm saying? We're not just salesmen. We are domestic enhancement specialists. We're not just selling knives. We are enhancing people's lives. Yeah. So... Where do you see yourself in a year? I'm not a salesman. I'm a domestic enhancement specialist. And I'm not selling knives. I'm... I'm enhancing your life. Son of a bitch! Fucking... damn it. Piece of shit. Fucking... Son of a bitch! Mom, I told you I was gonna be in meetings all day. Your sister wants to know if you're coming for the baby shower. Mom, baby showers are for chicks. I'll see her at Christmas. Her and Dan just bought a house. Well, good for them. That's what happens when you finish college and get a job. Ross? Hello? Hi, I'm Preston. In two short weeks, I went from being in the poorhouse to having more money than I knew what to do with. Ross! Well, uh... Well, things are about to change, mom. ♪ goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ ♪ he very wise in the herbal lore, has got young cure now ♪ Why are you following me, man? Preston, right? Yeah, do I know you? I saw you in the "remarkable power" infomercial. Jesus. They still showing that shit? I watch it every night. You need to get out more, bro. Yeah. I just moved here a couple months ago. Nobody even knows I'm here. My parents think I'm at some junior college back east. They're about to cut me off. You know, their whole attitude is just really getting on my nerves. What happened to your neck? What's your name, man? Ross. Ross... a little piece of friendly advice, Ross. If you want people to take you seriously in this town, you got to ditch the suit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, right, thanks. Did you say that nobody knows you're here? It's better that way, believe me. Do you want to know the real secret to "remarkable power"? Totally. I'll teach you about "remarkable power." Come on up. Is this where you live? Legal wants the standard five-second delay, but otherwise, we're a go for a live broadcast Friday. Excellent. Anything else? Your wife's on line one. City and listing, please. Hey. How did the show go today? The methuselah kid... a big hit. Well, that's great. Listen, I was wondering what time you were gonna be home tonight. Probably late. Bill wants to go over some ideas for Friday's show. Oh, okay. Well, I think I'm just gonna order in then and catch up on some reading. Tell bill I said hi. I will. And call me when you're on your way, okay? I love you. I'm on my way. Who's not Jack West, huh, you little bitch? Who hit the home run? You did! Subject is very limber. Very, very limber. Two outs, bottom of the ninth. He's got a full count. Everyone's on their feet. And here comes the pitch. It's a long fly ball... no, it's a home run! It's Jack. You got what you need? Yep, I'll get a check out to you in the morning. All right, well, I'm on another job for a few days, but if you need anything else, just give me a holler, okay? Right. All right. Subject and unknown male companion are conversing outside... Drinking what appears to be beer. Subject's movements are consistent with his injury claim. The pain seems to be centered in the neck and back regions. Okay, subject and unknown male companion are entering beach house. So, just make yourself comfortable. I'm gonna take a leak. Cool, thanks. Hmm. Okay, Preston. You can do this. Nobody's gonna miss this loser. It's perfect. It's perfect. You don't have a choice. It's him or it's you. You mind keeping those closed? Oh, uh, sorry, dude. Hey, you mind if I roll a doobie? Be my guest. Excellent, cool. Man, I still can't get over this setup. This only took you two weeks to do? Like, what's the big secret, man? I mean, you bought the tapes, and then what? I already told you. I just followed the simple step-by-step instructions, and voilà, look at my life now. You see, see... that's what I'm talking about, man. Everybody's so obsessed with this whole "getting the job" thing, like that's what life's all about. I mean, yeah, everyone needs money, except for monks or whatever, but, I mean, there's ways of dealing with that dilemma without wasting away in a cubicle. I mean, look at you, dude. This is a living example of what I'm talking about, you know what I'm saying? I knew that there was something different about "remarkable power." I mean, from the moment that I saw J.P. Zahn, I was just like, "that's where I'm coming from. Why grow the wheat when you can just chow down on the bread?" Am I right? I mean, so, is it like, two weeks after you bought the tapes, or after you finished the... God damn it, son of a bitch! Whoa. Hey, just shut the fuck up, man, just shut up. I mean, don't you fucking get it? What? There is no "remarkable power," man. It's bullshit. What? What are you talking about, it's bullshit? Don't tell me that you actually bought those tapes. Yeah, I bought the tapes. So what? I'm an actor, you moron. They paid me to say all that shit. It's a fucking scam. Wait. Could we hold on a second? What the fuck are you talking about, man? You can't actually believe that ordering a bunch of tapes is gonna change your life. I mean, you can't be that fucking stupid. Am I right? Hey, man, don't call me stupid. Okay, sorry. How about a complete sucker? Is that a little bit more on target there? Whoa, I would chill out with that. I mean, look at you, dude. Just go look in the mirror and look at yourself. You're a loser. Do yourself a favor, okay? I mean, just keep your mullet. It's cool. Go back to whatever redneck town you come from and stick pigs or do whatever you do. But you're not gonna make it here. You don't have a chance. So just go. I mean, just get out of my house. Seriously, just get the fuck out of my house. Do you hear what I'm saying to you, you stupid fuck?! I said don't call me that! Dude? Hey, dude? Oh, my god. Dude, are you okay? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Dude, okay, all right, you're gonna be fine, man. Oh, shit! Jesus! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Turn it off! Okay. Okay, fuck. Fuck. Call 911. 911, 911, 911. 911 emergency. Hello? This is 911. May I help you? Hello, this is 911. Is anybody there? Hello? Hey, it's Mike. I'm not in right now. I'm out catching some monster waves. Leave a message. This is 911 emergency. We just received a call from this number. Is anybody there? Hello? Is everything all right there, sir? Yeah, sorry. I was just... I dialed the wrong number. I was going for 411. Are you sure everything's all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Sorry about that. Have a good evening, sir. You, too. Gotcha. Shit! All right, think. Get it together. Think about it. "A," nobody saw shit. "B," screw this guy, he's a fucking actor. Here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna wait till the coast is clear, and then I'm gonna walk out that door, and I'm gonna forget that this whole thing happened. Don't you move! All right, all right, bad idea. New plan. Shit! Son of a bitch! Hey, baby. You are late. Enjoy it while it lasts, kids. Okay, no sign of subject for the last two hours. We are ending surveillance for the evening. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, who's that? It's a young woman. Approximately 20, 25 years of age. She's getting a ladder. Probably a crazy ex-girlfriend. She's in good physical condition, from behind. Note to self, start working out again. She's very attractive. Kind of like a young Audrey Hepburn. Bingo. Uh-oh, little surprise. Watch out, honey. Easy. Don't panic. There you go. Ooh. Nice move. That was close, baby. That was close. What is her story? ♪ girl of 16, whole life ahead of her ♪ ♪ slashed her wrists ♪ bored with life ♪ didn't succeed, thank the lord ♪ ♪ for small mercies all these televangelists with their big hair and circus makeup are making a mockery of religion. We're losing our sense of morality, Jack. How many kids have parents who are divorced, in jail, addicted to drugs or alcohol, or engaged in extramarital affairs? That's right, Jacko. God knows about your wife banging up a storm with the home-run king. It might be too late for us. But I pray it's not too late for the children. We got to break the chain. Yes, indeed. That cheap whore's getting drilled like a west Texas oil well. Making a damn fool out of you is what she's doing, brother. You gonna let her get away with that? Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Howdy. Jack, no! What is he doing? Oh, right, right. Now, what about the music industry? Step two... power over circumstance. Are you in a tough predicament? No need to worry. I will teach you how to take complete control of any situation, no matter how difficult. Congratulations, you are one step closer to success. Remember, we all possess the skills to magically transform our lives into our greatest financial dreams. We just need to put them to work. I told you not to call me stupid. You should have listened to me, dude. And you know what else? You're wrong about "remarkable power." ♪ she came, she came to meet a man ♪ ♪ she found an angel ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ ♪ goo goo, goo goo barabajagal was his name, now ♪ Gloria, it's me. I'm gonna need you to run some plates for me. The name of the new album is "Jesus, please kill me." Yes. That's a rather uplifting title. Well, you know, it depends on how you look at it, Jack. Let me ask you something, son. Do you believe in hell? Sure. We're living in it. L.A. is the capital. How's it looking? They're ready to roll. You sure you want to go through with this? No turning back now. What about Wade? I'll take care of him, too. You just make sure she's there. Oh, she'll be there. I'll be in touch. Get out while you can, friend, and the only way is through salvation. Exactly... death. No sign of subject in the last 24 hours. Which reminds me, Gloria, tomorrow, I need you to run a... Boo! Jesus Christ! Are you trying to get shot? Oh, relax. You're obviously a P.I. Are those some bad guys you're spying on? I can't divulge that kind of information. Oh, yes, you can. I'm kind of like a spy myself. Yeah, I noticed. Is that how you always work? Snooping around on people? No, that was a first, actually. The police usually get there before I do. As long as they don't kick me out, typically I usually get what I need. What you need? I have no idea what you're talking about. What exactly do you call what you're doing right now? Professional investigator. Right. A licensed professional investigator. Whatever. So, you gonna tell me what they did? All right. Subject filed an accident report. It's my job as a professional private investigator to find out if he did in fact have that injury and if it's a $10,000 injury or a $100,000 injury. Think he pretty much maxed out that policy, don't you? What do you mean? What do you mean? He's dead. He's dead? What kind of investigator are you? You saw a dead guy in that beach house? Yeah, that's my job. Can you prove this? Jesus Christ. What is this world coming to? You make money from this? Beats waiting tables. Here's your guy. What was his name? His name was Preston Hurst. He was an actor. He was on that late-night infomercial they play all the time for "remarkable power." Yeah, god, I knew he looked familiar. Who do you think the other guy was? Ross Griffin. He's got a place over in Korea town. Hmm. Ross Griffin, where are you? Ross j. Griffin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. That's the one. Screen name Brewerboy? Please. You want to have some fun? Sorry I'm late. No worries. How was work? Oh, busy. This whole week's been crazy. I hear that. God, haven't been here in a while, huh? Four years, actually. Has it been that long? Mm-hmm. They're canceling the show. What? For real? 15 years. Jack, I am so sorry. We had a great run. Can't expect much more than that. Yeah. I mean, no matter how special something is, at one point, the big guy upstairs is gonna pull the plug. I mean, one minute, you're enjoying the best years of your life, and then, just like that, it's over, kaput. It's part of your past. But, you know, we can't expect something to last forever, can we? I mean, you really got to be a pretty big moron to think something very special is gonna last. Some wine? Why not? ♪ got to deal with the devil ♪ Oh! You little bitch! ♪ done a deal with the devil ♪ ♪ from a heart made of steel ♪ rolling down the m-way ♪ took it to the smoke Oh, shit. I wish I could see the look on his face. Priceless, I'm sure. So now what? Now we just sit back and let him sweat a bit. You are one sick little dog. Shit! Who the fuck are you?! Oh, well. It was fun while it lasted. I wonder what he's doing. Having a nervous breakdown. I mean, that was your intention, right? Hey. I got an idea. Why don't we go over there? We can follow him in the surveillance mobile, collect some evidence. That's... that's not gonna happen. See, it's illegal for me to tail someone that's not my immediate subject. You're so boring. I'm boring? Come on. Indulge me. Please? I have been ind... I'm not boring, by the way. Everything's cool. That was just your mind messing with you. We'll just watch some TV. That's all we're gonna do. Everything is cool. A man was found dead earlier today at 4:30... you see how easy that was? Hi, I'm Preston. Shit! It is now time for you to learn the single most important lesson of my course. It's the key to overcoming any crisis, no matter how extreme. Shit. Shit, no, please. Please, please, please! Shit! Come on! Ross. Ross. Hey, pal. Did you miss me? I'm in charge. I'm in control. Come on, what are you doing? You're gonna lose him. I know how to tail someone. Unlike you, I'm a professional. Whatever. I'm a licensed private eye. What's he doing? He's getting out. This is getting kind of weird. Well, it's about to get weirder, because he's walking towards the police station. Any of these would go pretty well with that wig. That's the Rollie Fingers. Very popular. Yeah, all I need is a curve ball and a wad of chewing tobacco, right? Rollie Fingers? He's a baseball player. Michael Jackson... ooh-ooh! Let me guess, biker bar? We call it the C.H.P. This actually kind of looks like one of the village people. Was it the cop? Was it... remember the village people? Y-m-c-a! It was a band. Going to a Halloween party, I take it? Not exactly. Ross Griffin. I'm detective Mack. This is detective shaver. Pay no attention to the costumes. It's a little undercover operation. We understand you've confessed to a murder. Is that correct? That's right. And you claim this murder was accidental? Yes. The murder happened yesterday, and yet you waited until tonight to report it. Why wait so long? I guess I panicked. You panicked? Yeah, I panicked. I mean, I'm not a professional hit man. I find it hard to believe that you could have such a heated argument with someone you just met. What were you arguing about? "Remarkable power." "Remarkable power"? Wait, wait, wait. The self-help thing on TV? It's not... let me get this straight. You had an argument with someone you just met about a self-help program, and then you killed him. It was an accident. He was telling me what a sucker I was. I hate to break this to you, pal, but you've got to be a sucker if you think that buying a bunch of tapes is gonna change your life. And now someone is dead. I hope you learned your lesson. There's no easy way to become successful, Ross. It takes hard work. All right, already! Jesus, I shouldn't have bought the tapes. Are you gonna arrest me for being an idiot, too? Officially, you haven't been arrested for anything. There's no evidence that a crime has been committed. Aside from your word, of course. What, you don't believe me? You sure you got the right house? This is it. This is exactly where he was. I swear to god. Yeah, sure he was, Ross. Hey, listen, next time you decide to pay us a visit, let the drugs wear off first, huh? Well, either there's somebody out there sicker than you, or he wasn't as dead as you thought he was. You saw the pictures. Yeah, I saw pictures of what looked like a dead guy, but for all I know, he got up and walked out afterwards. What are you doing? My job. Shit! If you are calling regarding a vehicle which has been impounded, please call back during normal business hours. Shit! Preston, it's candy. Where are you? Call me, okay? Hey, pres, it's Mike.

It's your old buddy. Look, shut up with that shit. This is Elvira, isn't it? Congratulations. You're smarter than I thought. So it was you. I guess I should thank you. Why did you do it? Do what? You know what I'm talking about. Where did you take him? Come again? Preston! Where did you dump him? You know what, I think Ross still probably moved the body. You said you saw him leave the beach house. I did, and I filmed him. And then I followed him, but... What? But I left my camera running, filming the beach house. Don't tell me you didn't watch it. Okay, I won't tell you. I can't believe it. You're the worst detective ever. He looks much better breathing. He's kind of cute. Uh, well, that was the last day I saw him. Here's the next day. Wait, stop. What's that? Looks like someone's doing a little spring cleaning. Don't they mention somebody named Vlado on Preston's machine? Yeah, Vlado was gonna help Preston with his problem, whatever that was. Well, I'd say unless it included some seriously hard-to-remove carpet stains... I think we found our body snatchers.

'Cause your egotistical little brain is so bloated, you actually think you know more about the business than someone that's been in it for over 40 years? Or maybe because ever since you got here... what's it been, like two years now? You've done nothing but try to kill my show, a show that was pulling in some of the biggest shares in network history when you were waking up in your own vomit at some frat party? Or could it simply be that you walk around with your nose up so many people's asses, you have no idea how bad your own shit stinks? Other than that, I think you're a swell guy, skip. Candy? Oh, gosh. Thanks again, candy. Thank Ross. He's the one who paid bail. Thanks, man. I'll get you back. No problem. So, are you gonna tell us what happened? I mean, just look at you. Oh, man, this is one fucked-up situation. Where do I even start? How about from the beginning? Shit. All right. Can y'all do me one more favor? I need to get some chicken and waffles in me real bad. If you know what I mean. You talk, I'll drive. Yo. What up? Damn, son. When you gonna ditch the E.R. Look? When I can fucking move. What we have here? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's all I got, man. That's cool. It's cool. I don't need no artificial high tonight. Why's that? Oh, I don't know. Could it be because a brother finally caught a break in this Lily-white industry? No shit? They're remaking "roots," man? That's great. That's funny. I'm just kidding, man. You got that schlitz malt liquor commercial, though? Keep going. You're looking at the lead talent on a national, bitch, right here. National? Get out of here. Enough cash to last me a year, and a closet full of boxer briefs. That's really great, man. I'm... I am proud of you. Thanks, man. So what's this favor you have for me? It's in that box down there. It's a good thing you got that lock on there. I know if I was ripping you off, I'd be like, "whoa, that shit's got a lock. Better not go in there." Take this shit to Suarez. Oh, man, I don't got time to be riding all the way over there. Look, it's not like you're Denzel yet, all right? So if you could find it in your heart to do me a favor, that would be great. It's just one deal, man. It's obviously a big one. I owe Moses 10 grand. I got to pay him by Thursday. Otherwise, I'm in deep shit. I'll give you 100 bucks. 100 bones? All right, I'll give you 200 bucks. Plus your ride. Jesus, man. Fine. Just come right back here, all right? Don't stop at the fucking mini mart, pick up bitches, or whatever you do. Bitch, please. How about that? Get out of the fucking car! You want to die, boy?! Come on! Come on, get out of the car! Oh, god! Fuck you! Get off me! Get off me! Yeah, boy, bust him up! Bust him up! Get! Get! What the hell is that? Just keep your fucking mouth shut, all right? I told you. What did we tell you about showing up unannounced? This ain't no am pm. And who the fuck is that? Look, I'm sorry, I've just... I've got a situation, and I need to talk to Moses. This better be good. What a look of concentration on that face. Guy better be swinging. 2-1 pitch on the way. Wade swings, and there's a long fly ball deep to left field. Williams is at the track. That ball is gone! Yes! Yeah, baby, yeah! Hand it over, son. Yo, big bro. We got a visitor. Look, I'm sorry, Moses, but we got a big problem here. Reggie was carjacked. Hmm. And your point is? The blow was in the car. I'm still waiting for the part that concerns us. Did you hear it, tiny? Nope. Huh? Me neither. Yeah. So... I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna be able to get your money on time. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh. Let's think about that, hmm? No. See, I disagree, porn star. Yenta here has got some big-ass balls interrupting our evening with this bullshit, huh? There's only one way to make sure it doesn't happen again. Number three. Hey, hey, hey, come on. No, no, no, Moses! No, no, no! Don't you move an inch, boy. Moses, Jesus Christ, let go of my fucking legs! Do you know who Moses was from the Bible? Yeah, he was the ten commandments dude. Ten commandments dude. That is correct. Or as us chosen ones prefer to call him, the giver of the law. See, now, Moses brought down that law from mount Sinai for a reason. Tell him why, Damon. Helps keep shit in order. And order is a good thing. Tell him why it's a good thing, tiny. Helps shit run efficiently. And efficiency, it's a very good thing. Wouldn't you agree with that, porn star? Yeah. So... When did you say you were gonna have my money? So, Ivan says you are good workers, yes? Uh, yes. We'll do anything. We just need to get our hands on... $10,000, yes, yes, I understand. When do you need this money? Thursday. Yes, well, that can be done, but you must work fast. I would say best is man, between 40 and 50, over 6 feet tall, white skin. Yes, we don't need black right now. I don't understand. Ivan did not tell you? No. You are to find a body, eh? A corpse. Did you say corpse? Yes, dead body. But it must be fresh. No more than two, three days. If it is rotten, he is no good for us. You can do this, no? Yeah. Um, so, where do we take the body? No, no, no, no. You give me address, we pick up body. We will leave you key for safe deposit box. Inside box will be your money. Right, right, right. Yes. We will be Thursday, noon. You leave key over door. Yes, thank you. Goodbye. Yes. Yes. Two years ago, I was living in a trailer. I had no job. I was seriously in debt, and I weighed 98 pounds. But look at you now! That's right, look at me now. Now I live in a 10,000-square-foot mansion in Beverly... Damn. You just check those trays. I'll check these. Yo, check it out. Nick Nolte finally died. Whoa. Barbecue. Did somebody young die? Yo, I think we got a winner. I'm so sorry, Mrs. Belinski. This won't take long. Shit! Just go, go, go, go! All I'm saying is, a lot of the best actors got their starts in commercials. It's the perfect stepping stone to features. To... to features? Yeah. It's a fucking butt-hugger commercial, man. You call that acting? Oh, I'm sorry. Maybe I should just give up and start doing some cheap-ass skin flicks. I knew you were gonna say that. Reggie, I hope all your Hollywood dreams come true. Thank you. Let's just fucking get this over with, please. Looks dead. This mariachi got no legs. Why don't you just try to get another agent then? And let some other Hollywood jerk-off send me off on worthless auditions? I don't think so, man. See, that's your problem right there. See, you can't handle the rejection. That's a part of the process, brother. Every actor's got to... Will you just worry about yourself, okay? Don't worry about me. I'm fine. Just dig. Just trying to help. Yo. We in business. Yo, Preston! Where the fuck you go?! Evening. You mind telling me what you're doing down there? Damn, this shit's good. Thank you. So, that was the last time you saw Preston. Yep, I figured he'd gone back to the beach house, but I guess not. Nigga must have skipped town or something. So how you know Preston? Ross? Hello? Sorry. I don't really know Preston. I know Matt. Who the hell is Matt? I mean Mike, Mike. Excuse me a second. Where did you meet this joker at? At the beach house. Did you say that nobody knows you're here? I know what you're thinking. You should be dead right now. Preston chickened out and blew his opportunity for success. Don't make the same mistake. Ditch these clowns. Oh, come on, don't tell me you're into this broad. Maybe. What's the big deal? Well, how long do you think this charade is gonna last, huh? It's only a matter of time before she finds out that you whacked her boyfriend. It was an accident. Was it? Really? Hey, wise up. She's using you, just like she used Preston. Remember, Ross, you are in charge. You are in control. Man, why you use a fork with the chicken, man? Use your hand. Hey, ain't that tiny disco bagel over there? Hell, no. Motherfucker. Five minutes, Jack. Thanks, Tim. Oh, hey, do me a favor, will you? Give this to skip right after the show. You got it. Go get 'em, handsome. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, here is your host, Jack West! Um, how did you get into this line of... Work? Are you looking for something more profound? So, you just like to look at dead people? Doesn't everybody? Um, no. I don't think so. Uh-oh. We have movement. And we are back! Okay, folks, we... by the way, chavo, you are looking quite dapper tonight. Is that a new suit? Well, Jack, you'd have to ask my wife. And speaking of wives, I think I see your better half in the audience, Jack. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. And of course, I had to talk her into coming here tonight. Cynthia, why don't you stand up so all the folks out in TV land can see how lucky I am? Oops. It looks like somebody's sleeping on the couch tonight, Jack. Sorry, honey. Enjoy the show, kids. [ Humming [ "take me out to the ball game" ] All right, now, bro. Let's see the show. Foul ball. Bringing on the heat tonight. Maybe you should choke up. Maybe you should go to hell. Shit! Strike two! Oh, damn! Did you see that shit?! I see your ass getting fanned. Let me show you how it's done, son. I know it hurt. I know it hurts. Strike one, meshuggeneh. What the fuck? Whoo! That shit was high. Bullshit! That was a strike! Yo, dairy queen! Was that shit high or what? Looked a little high, man. That look high to you? That would be a ball in my book. Bullshit! Chest to knees! That is the strike zone! Now, that's a strike. Here we go. Who's this guy? I have no idea. What the hell is going on here? What the hell did you do? Nothing. It's the same as before. Well, obviously not, hebro. This shit ain't closing. Step aside. Let me try this shit. Must be the lock. There's nothing wrong with the lock, Schwartz. It's the fucking Dolly. Candy? There's something I got to tell you. I should have told you a long time ago, but I couldn't. It's hard to tell someone, I mean, especially someone... Ross, I think I know what you're saying. I seriously doubt that. Then what are you saying? I'm afraid that I... I sort of killed Preston. What? Okay, our next guest is the one you've all been waiting for. I know I have been. After his recent performances in the world series, he needs no introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, a warm round of applause for hometown hero Doug Wade! Doug! How are you? Good. Wow, what an ovation. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. What can I say? You know, Jack, it's been a while since big blue's won the big dance. Yes, it has been. Yep. Now, I understand your wife is here with you tonight? She is. Ah. Along with my daughter, Tiffany, and my son, Tommy. Where are you, Lauren? Oh, there she is. Hi, baby. Yeah, wow. Good season for you, huh? Yeah. Now I understand that you're a free agent, and I hear you're looking at a payday of maybe $300 million? Whew! Well, you know, that's what my agent thinks. I hope you got a pre-nup. Excuse me? I'm kidding. I'm kidding. No, but seriously, when you're out there on the road, you got to have a lot of women looking to get up close with a big ballplayer like Doug Wade. Does that ever present a problem? No, no, no. Not for me, Jack. I... I love my wife. Ah, that's nice to hear, Doug. I want to go in there. Uh... You led the league in home runs. I did. I saw you drill one all the way home. That felt pretty good, huh? Felt great, actually, Jack. Yeah, you know, you have to understand, there's a lot of pressure... Now, what would you say was the climax of the year for you? Well, Jack, I'd have to say that the climax was that last home run I hit. I bet it was. I bet it was. Yeah. Folks, let's take a look at one of the most memorable moments in baseball history. Okay, there you are, you're holding the wood. Mm-hmm. You're about to enter the box. Oh, yeah. What's going through your mind, Doug Wade? Well, I'm thinking, Jack, it's time to drill this baby home. I bet you are. Tony, let's roll the tape. And so the season comes down to this. Two on, two out, bottom of the ninth, game six of the world series. And what a matchup! Temple is arguably the best reliever in the game. His postseason E.R.A. a remarkable 0.88. From the stretch, the pitch. Low and away, ball one. If the dogs could have anyone at the plate right now, it would be Wade. He posted league-leading numbers in home runs and RBIs. Everyone's on their feet. 1-0 pitch on the way. Wade swings and misses. 1-1. Doug is already a star in a city that boasts so many. The question is, can he rise to the occasion? Who are you? I said, who are you?! Aah! You little bitch! The delivery. Low, 2-1. There has got to be tremendous pressure on Wade right now. The series is literally on his shoulders. What a look of concentration on that face. 2-1 pitch on the way. Wade swings, and there's a long fly ball. That ball is gone! Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, Doug! Man, he got all of that one! Oh, my god! You son of a bitch. Bite me. Get this whore off me. Get the whore off me. Go, go, go, go! What happened? There was somebody there, but I think I have something... we got to get to my house first. Where is he? He disappeared. What do you mean, he disappeared? Hey, skip, Jack wanted me to give you this. Grand slam, Jack. Out of the park. Good luck. Thanks. I'm gonna miss you. I'll miss you, too. Take care. Don't ever forget the most important rule in showbiz. What's that? It ain't over till the fat lady sings. Who's your master?! You are! Who's your master?! You are. Bark. Bark! Bark, you pathetic little dog... you bark! You bark when I say bark! Porn star should win a golden globe for this shit. You bark when I say bark! Disco, unless you're done feeding me that dead body mafia bullshit, I suggest you knock off the whining. Nothing! Bark, I said! Bark, I said! So, you say this place here belongs to your buddy Mike. I told you, Moses. Mike is Preston's cousin. Let's let John boy here talk. Look, I don't know the guy that well. Preston just told me that he was out of town and I could stay for the weekend. Oh, he did, huh? The fuck?! Who are you? Who the fuck are you? Hey, chill out, Spicoli. We're all friends of Preston's. Well, where is he? Well, your buddy Ross here said he stopped by a couple days ago, and porn star wasn't around. Who? You mean you don't know this cat? Come on, damn it, answer. It's me. Where the hell are you? I'm almost home. Call me. Oh, my god. Top story tonight is a tragic one. Moments ago, late-night talk-show host Jack West was found dead in the living room of his Hollywood Hills home, the victim of an apparent murder. Paramedics, responding to an anonymous 911 call, found west lying on the floor with three gunshot wounds to the chest. Time of death is unknown, but is believed to be shortly after the controversial live taping of his talk show earlier this evening. Now on to more breaking news. Freeze! Put your hands up! What the fuck? Okay, okay, okay. Listen, chill. I'm Doug Wade, all right? Shocking twist to an already tragic story as police now have a suspect in custody for the murder of talk-show host Jack West. The suspect is none other than L.A. Dogs star Doug Wade. Mr. Wade! Wade was arrested in front of his Beverly Hills mansion, where police discovered a 9mm revolver under the driver's seat of his vehicle. Aah, shit! Aah! I knew this cracker didn't know Mike! Called you Matt at one point. Then he shells out for my chicken and waffles... even paid cash for my bail! Bitch-ass didn't even ask for his money back! Oh, you got some cash on you, huh? Look, I don't know what you guys are talking about. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh. I'd say you got about three seconds to explain. Uh, he's dead. What? What? Preston, he's dead. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I mean, it was an accident. You bitch-ass motherfucker, I will kick your pale ass! Chill out, disco! Continue. I met him on the boardwalk. We talked. He invited me up here. But he started getting on my case about buying into "remarkable power." That self-help program? Yes. Everybody knows that shit's a scam. I'm aware of that, thank you. May I continue? By all means. I didn't know what to do after that, so I just kind of left him there. And then I got a call from this chick, Elvira, who was saying that she knew what I did. Even e-mailed me pictures of him. Oh. So, you know, I went and got the cops and brought them back here. Oh, yeah. But Preston was gone. And everything was all cleaned up. So then I realized that Preston was actually gonna kill me, because he needed the dead body. Of course. And, well, that's all I know. That's about the stupidest story I've ever heard in my life. Well, time's up, cheddar head. Number one. Nobody move! What the fuck?! Put the guns down, nice and easy. Do what he says, now. Who the fuck are you?! Remember us? No! Not you, him. Oh. We did a little check on your story. Turns out your pal Preston's landlady called in a disturbance. The place was trashed, and there was a dirty shovel over in the corner. Oh, and there was this. Guess who, porn star? That's right, it's Moses. You got till tomorrow night to produce, or the brothers are gonna unleash a little fire and brimstone on your gentile ass. You hear me? Oh, now, see, that was bullshit, okay? Cheez whiz here killed Preston. You can ask him yourself. You got a big fancy pad up in the hills, don't you? A couple pricey cars, a lot of nice toys? Tell me, how exactly does a kosher chicken-and-waffle restaurant owner afford all that expensive stuff? You guys... first off... like I said, put the guns down. Okay, you got it. No! I'm standing in front of the west residence, where Jack West's wife, Cynthia, has just been arrested. It appears Mrs. West may be charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Holy shit. You're never gonna believe this. The body of talk-show host Jack West, found dead earlier this evening, has mysteriously disappeared from the L.A. county morgue, where it was awaiting an official autopsy. I'm reporting live from the L.A. county morgue, where the body of talk-show host Jack West was just reported missing.
