I'm your host, Paris Hilton, and I'm so excited to present "Trap Stars," the hottest new show on television. What's up, Trap Stars? Welcome to the Trap House. There's only one rule at the Trap House, Trap Stars must isolate and can't leave the mansion. Sounds simple enough, right? I mean, there's worse places to be quarantining, you know? I'm used to going out and partying and doing all that fun shit, and I just really hate being stuck in the house. I'm just having fun, I'm here to do my-- Fuck you. Bitch. Hey, I'm Lauren. Mind if I take this off? Yeah, you're good. Come on inside. You know, I don't usually do this dating app thing and go over to random guys' houses. You're not nervous, are you? Nervous? Nervous, yes. ♪ La-la, la-la. ♪ ♪ La-la, la-la. ♪ ♪ La-la, la-la-- ♪ It's nice to meet you, Tom. And it's nice to meet you too, Lauren. Mm-hmm. Wait. But I don't like to wait. Mm-hmm. But get comfortable. Yes, ma'am. I'll be back. Okay, I'll, I'll do just that. Hello. Hello? Yo, who is this? Hello! Hello? Is somebody here? Yo, Lauren, you all right in there? Yeah, I'll be out in a minute! Hello? Lauren, lock the fucking door! Come out, you pussy! God, dude! Tom? Tom, stop fucking around. What the fuck? Yo, dude! What's up, dude? You have to drive, I'm too hung over. Are you fucking serious? Yeah, man. Oh my God. I'm so fucking nauseous. And I'm sorry for making you isolate. My roommates are mad paranoid about COVID. It's only a week, though. No, I get it, I mean, I just came from New York. It's like fucking Chernobyl over there. Hey, let's just get this out of the way. I feel really responsible for your break-up. No, babe, please don't. No, honestly, I mean, if I had known your boyfriend would just break up with you and throw you out for webcamming, I mean, I would have never told you about it. No, babe, honestly, it's not your fault. He's literally trash. Look, I was broke and you gave me a solution, so I'm over it. You know what? That's the right mindset, babe. Plus it was kind of fun, fulfilling fantasies. You remember my roommate Desi, you know, the one from freshman year? Uh-huh. Okay, I heard that she's on 18 & Over. She's webcamming? Yeah, man. She was on that shit fingering herself, making out with her roommate, taking naked showers, doing tons of crazy shit. Anyways, that bitch is making $40K a month doing that shit. $40K? Dude, I can't just go on there and do crazy shit like that, do you know what I mean? Like, I usually just fucking lay around in lingerie and try and look sexy. Just get a little naked, show a little bit of ass. I mean, you have nice tits. It's a no-brainer. You know what? You're right, I'm just going to spend the next week webcamming and making some money so I don't have to keep couch surfing. Aw, he's so cute. That's the neighbors' kids. You're definitely not in New York anymore. My grandfather was really into hunting, in case you can't tell. It's definitely a vibe. All right, here's some numbers you're going to need. Sheriff Rodgers, she's really nice. She's actually really cool, I hope you get to meet her. But I hope you never have to meet her, you know what I mean? Okay, you're a fucking idiot, continue. Okay, all right, second, Kim and Max Daniels. They live next door, they're really cool, young couple, whatever. You saw their kids earlier. And like I said, they're your only neighbors for like 17 miles, there's nobody here. Call me if you need anything. I will. See you in a week. Bye, dude. Meanwhile, on the other side of the mansion-- But yeah, he just did not want to fucking commit to me. Like, I'm like, yo, I love you, do you love me back? The fight over the video games was crazy. We're all just partying, having fun. Spence walks in trying to, like, get her attention. It's, it's between us. Come take a shot, come do a shot! It's just-- This, like, pissy fucking mood. Really? What! What the fuck is wrong with you? You turned off my PlayStation, didn't you? Hitting me in front of everyone? Are you serious? That was so beyond! Just go, just go! I'm out of here! The fuck! Oh my God. Did you really turn his PlayStation off, though? Is that the point? No, I'm just saying, I'm just saying! Is that literally the point? Why don't you go fucking join him? Just join him. What a fucking moron. - Oh my gosh, what is wrong with these men! Are you kidding me? Shit! Fuck me. - So, I love Lindsey. - Right now... - I would say Shannon. I-- - Hey, what's your name? Take your top off. - You're so beautiful. - Oh my God, you are worth every fucking dollar. - I, I love you in that wig. - I want to get to know you, like, in a real way. - How did you get that body? - You're so special. - Babe, I want to see your tits so fucking bad, please. Hello? So, you survived your first night? Ugh, barely. I literally feel like I'm losing my mind. And you just got there, relax. So, what are you up to? Oh, you know, just been webcamming. I just got another one. Ugh, God, it's that tape guy. Do you remember I was telling you about him? Yeah, that weirdo who puts tape before his camera? Freak. God, I don't know if I can deal with him right now. Isn't he your biggest client? Suck it up. He kind of went crazy on me last time. He takes this role playing shit way too serious. Whatever, who gives a shit. It's not like you're going to ever meet him anyway. Baby, I thought I'd never see you again. Sorry about last time. I g-got a little carried away. You just felt so distant. I'm sorry, daddy. I need to be able to trust you. How can I make it up to you? Tell wifey. Oh my God. I got you a ring. I want you all to myself. Put your money where your mouth is. I love pleasuring my husband. I love it when you call me your husband, but now I need you to prove it. Make me a video, just for me. I'd love to. - Follow me, I love my followers. Make sure you follow me on social media @ben. Let's go! Don't vote me out. America, what's good? - I take this quarantine really, really seriously, so I'm just trying to set the tone and, you know, be a good example. - I want to prioritize my-- ♪ No matter what, Can never play myself. ♪ Hey, it's Stacy. Leave a message. Or don't, whatever. Are you ignoring me because you're having mind-blowing sex with your boyfriend? You lucky bitch. I'm here all alone without any Wi-Fi and I'm starting to get really fucking horny. Somebody call the handyman? ♪ Will you be my drugs, Will you be my therapy? ♪ Okay. Hey, do you want some coffee or anything? Oh, I'm all right, sweetie, thank you. Appreciate it, though. Are you, you all alone up here? Yeah, unfortunately. Must get lonely, huh? So, where are you from? Near here. Really? You don't look like you're from here. Well, I mean, I've been living in New York the last couple of years. Oh, cool. So, it looks like your cable got cut here. I'm going to have to come back in a couple of days, run some wire. I put these temporary guys in here, it should help with your Wi-Fi for now. Wait, okay, so, the line got cut. Does that mean that someone did that or... Around here? No, no, it was probably just some curious animal or something, you know? Lot of creatures around here. Anyway, we'll get you set up, you'll be fine. Okay. So, uh... you want anything else? No, just want to get that fixed. Well, I'll see you soon. I think Lucas is cute. A slick back, and he can dress! If I had to guess who has a crush on me, maybe it might be Deadass? I feel like making my move on Lindsey. He does look over at me pretty often, and every time I go to the bathroom he's kind of, like, within 20 feet. I think he likes to hear me pee. I've been working on a piece all day. Oh yeah, anything good? Yeah, um... actually, I've been making stuff about you. How, how old are you, anyway? I look older without my glasses on, but, you know, I kind of look young right now. Oh really? Yeah. You look older without your glasses on. I'll take them off. I kind of want to kiss you right now. I just made out with Deadass, and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. He was a little smaller and I wasn't used to it, but he wasn't bad. I know she's in love with me. Wait, you forgot your glasses. Vicky, Vicky, my love! Jazzy! Oh, thank you for the donation. So, how are you? How's the wife? Well, I got to tell you, be honest with you, I mean, this whole isolation trip, I mean, we've been fighting all the time, man. I mean, I don't even know what to do anymore. I mean, I feel invisible here. It's going to work out. People are going crazy in quarantine right now. And you know why she'll come around? Because look at you, you are one handsome man. Oh, come on, you didn't have to say that. But enough about me, I want to know what's going on with you. I'm fine, just want this year to be over. So, so, did you move out? Yeah, I moved home. Well, I'm really sorry. It hurts me to see you sad. You know I'm a fan, right? Or a friend. Listen, I got to start dinner because my wife doesn't cook. I'll see you later. I want you so bad. Yo. Sorry about that. Oh, Jesus fucking Christ, you scared the shit out of me. Sorry. It's, it's going to be $21.50. All right. You know what, just, here, keep the change. Thanks for coming all the way out here. Say, I kind of got to take a leak, you know what I mean? You mind if I use your bathroom? Dude, come on, can't you just piss in the woods? Can I piss in the woods? Do I look like an animal to you? You know what, fine, just hurry up. Hey, you know, I think I've heard about this place before. What? Yeah, this is definitely the place. Okay, what are you talking about? Do you mind? Mm, you don't have COVID, do you? Dude, no. Oh, yeah. Oh yeah. Rumor has it, about 20 years ago a guy marches into town, breaks into this very house and tortures this fucking family for about two weeks. He was playing mind games, tormenting them. Real sick individual, you know? Finally, once he gets his rocks off, he sits the parents down and forces them to watch as he chops up the little kids into bits and pieces. I mean, some real fucking Buffalo Bill shit. I mean, I'm surprised you haven't heard about it. Are you sure it was this house? My friend's family has had this place-- Hello, Sorriso's Pizza. Oh yeah, Mr. Burns, I'm already in the car. I'll see you soon. I got to split, but thanks for the hospitality. Hey, are you sure it was this house the family was killed in? Hmm, it might have been a few towns over. Thanks for the tip. Yeah, I'm on the way, man. I told you, 30 minutes or less, I promise. Bye-bye. This fucking guy. What the fuck is that? Whoa! What the hell, dude, what are you doing? Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. I was calling after you and you had that shit in your ears, you couldn't hear me. Jesus Christ. I'm Sheriff Rodgers and this is my nephew, Deputy Wayne. Ma'am. He's a rookie cookie. He's just in training. So, what are you doing up here in these parts? Do you know the Stewarts? Yeah, I'm staying there for the week. What are you guys doing out here? Well, we were heading over to the neighbors and saw you running like a God damn gazelle. Just wanted to make sure you're not running from something. Getting eaten alive out here. Is, are the neighbors okay? You know, we're going to check on the neighbors because their relatives were calling us saying they couldn't get a hold of them. So, just checking in. All right, well, I hope everyone's okay. You know, we should probably get you back. We'll drive you. Getting dark. You know, they recently found a young girl's body not too far from here. They found a dozen other bodies killed the same exact way all across the country. Real gruesome. They're calling him the Crowbar Killer. And all his victims were young females around your age. First he kills everyone around her, then he saves her for last. Well, actually, I think we're dealing with a classic serial killer. Would you cut that out? You're scaring the bejesus out of her! Wait, wait, wait, why is my door open? You two stay in the car. Wait, did you hear that? Whatever, she said stay in the car. Hey, where the fuck are you going? Dude, if she's in trouble, we have to help her. Come on! Do you have a gun? Fuck no, they don't give me that shit. Fuck! Come on. Sheriff? Fuck this shit, I'm getting out of here. Oh! Oh shit! Relax, it's me! That is so not funny. Oh, come on, come on, that was funny. Jesus Christ, you nearly scared my sac off! Yeah, I should have listened to your mom, you are not cut out for this. Okay, stop! Who was in my house? I checked the house, the house is secure. I think your door just blew open from a gust of wind. Oh, that's real comforting. I mean, your lock's pretty old. Let's go. Happy Halloween. Make sure you get that door fixed. Here we go! Do I just start going back and forth? You go back a little bit, you go forward a little bit. Like this? Turn to your right. Beautiful! Is that it? Now you're talking. You're really good! And now get ready, make believe you're holding my hand right here. Okay, but don't drop me, all right? Turn to your right! Yes. It's all hips, all hips, all hips. There you go. Um, hey, Lou, I had a blast, but I have to go, okay? Okay, but I'm going to keep dancing, because once Jazzy is lit, I'm good to go. All right, bye. Peace! Hey, baby. Just give me two seconds, I'm going to go get ready for you. Hurry up, your husband's in a spending mood. Oh my God. You're so beautiful. I n-n-need you to make me another video. Did you like my last video? Or was the mask too much? I n-need you to do it again, without the mask. I need to see your eyes when you tell me you love me. But you already know that. I love my future husband. Show me. Put your money where your mouth is. How much will it take to make you mine? Mm... This much? I can't wait to put this ring on yo-- Fuck! Fuck! Sheriff, it's me, Vicky. You were in my cabin earlier? There's someone outside of my house. Okay, go hide somewhere safe. I'm headed over. Okay, but how long is this going to take? About 30 minutes, go hide. Please, please, please hurry! Hey. Fuck, what the fuck! Who are you? I could ask you the same thing! I said, who the fuck are you! I'm their neighbor, okay, Max Daniels. Oh my God, you're the neighbor. Max... I am so sorry. You were in the house-- I'm sorry, the door was open, I thought they were here. I... oh my God. I was hunting yesterday, I heard music coming from the cabin. I just figured that Stacy was in town and... Actually, that's why I came. We like to smoke together. Don't judge. Well, I could definitely use a joint after that. Oh my God, oh my God, I am so sorry. I'll, I'll r-roll one up while you get changed. Okay. Really sorry about that, Max. I'll get something for that cut. Shit! Hey. All right. Let's get that cleaned up. I know, I know, I know. It's almost over, I'm sorry! There, is that better? Yeah. I'm sorry for slashing your face. It's okay. Ugh, I've just been paranoid. I mean, I met these cops earlier today and they were telling me about that girl who got killed not too far from here. You know, the Crowbar Killer? Oh yeah, is that what they're calling him now? Yeah, I guess. I hope they find him. This year can't get any crazier. I hear that. - Because they're out of control. The pool guy has drowned! - Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. I couldn't give him CPR. He goes to a lot of pools, I don't know if he has COVID or not. Is this real? Yes, and I'm, like, the biggest fan of it. Hey, I saw your kids the other day. They were really cute in their little Halloween costumes. Yeah. Unfortunately, they're gone. Gone? Yeah, my ex has them for the next two weeks. Oh, right. We split up about six months ago. I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm killing the mood. Oh, fuck. I have to handle that. Everything okay, ma'am? Yeah, yeah, everything is fine. Sorry for the false alarm. You sounded pretty scared on the phone. No, no, no, I know, umm, I'm fine. Mind if we take a look around? I've actually, I have company. You have company. I don't see any cars out here. Wait, are you fucking the neighbor? Look, you guys, I, I'm really sorry for making you come all the way up here. Well, you tell your friend to call his family. They're worried about him. Yeah, of course. Bye. Home wrecker. Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. I just panicked earlier and called the cops. But they're gone now, so. Well, it's getting late, I should probably be heading back. Got to feed the doggo. Oh. Okay. Thanks for the hang. Have a good night. I was so nervous when Paris called the meeting for the house. Hey, guys. Hi! I bet you guys are wondering what I'm doing here. - Yeah. - Yeah. Lindsey's boyfriend just got released early from prison because of COVID and he will be joining our cast. Lindsey has a boyfriend? Lindsey has a boyfriend? Why is he smashing that ass, then? Baby! Oh, I'm so happy you're out of prison! I'm a little bit worried about what might happen between Deadass and my boyfriend. Welcome to the Trap House. Why would she lie to me?

You know, I feel like such a bad influence, first with the weed, now with the booze. It's a stiff one. I can take it. Wow, this is delicious, what is this? Well, since the split, I've really got into different craft drinks. I'm no mixologist, but thanks for being my test dummy. It's called a Downhill Daring. Hey, think fast. Buddy, I thought that you played football. I did, I was the kicker. Ah, got it. Feeling tense, huh? I honestly can't believe that you watch this. Ever since you showed me, I've been hooked. I mean, these people are so insane. I know, I'm addicted. Hey. That's a good boy. Come on, get out of here, leave her alone. Go, go, go. Aw, he's so sweet. He is. Wait, who is this with your kids? That is my ex and the man who is now sleeping with her. I'm sorry, I'm being nosy. No, no, it's okay. I leave it out for when the kids come to visit.

This nightmare has been going on much, much longer. Can we not talk about my ex? I'm sorry, I'm being totally fucking annoying. It's okay. I'm a little drunk. I just want to say that I hear you. My ex and I, we recently split, as well. And on top of all of that, he kicked me out of our place, so. Wow. You want to talk about it? No, definitely not. Okay. So... what do you want to talk about then? It's just been so weird with Corona and quarantine and moving from New York, going through a break-up. I just feel like my life is falling apart. But now I'm finally starting to feel like myself again. Amen to that. I can't. It's too soon. Sorry if I made it awkward back there. I think you're really beautiful. I think you're really handsome. That was fun. Yeah. It was. Good night. Bye, good night. Ahh! Ahh! Hey, hey, whoa, hey! Don't come any closer, I'll fucking kill you! Chill! I said, step back! I think there's been a little misunderstanding. Why are you at my cabin? It's my uncle's fucking cabin, man. What fucking uncle? Look, you must be friends with my cousin Stacy, right. You can't fucking prove that, do better! Oh, come on! Do better! When we were 12, I accidentally pushed her off the porch steps, that's why she has that scar on her nose. Look, I'm a truck driver, I work for a fucking carrier service. Been on the road for the past three days, I got tired. I usually crash here if I'm working the coast. If you're a truck driver, where's your truck? It doesn't make it up these roads, it's too muddy. It's down the road. Fucking-a. You scared the shit out of me! I fucking pissed myself. Fuck it, whatever, I'm going back to the cabin. I'm sorry about earlier. No, I'm sorry. I almost took your fucking head off with that bat. It's my bad. You don't have COVID or anything like that, do you? No, I got tested before I hit the road, so. You're kind of the first person I've talked to in like a week. Cool. How did you walk all the way out here? I mean, it's kind of far from the main road. I hiked in. I know these woods like the back of my hand. Been coming here since I was a little kid. So, you just truck up and down the coast? You have, like, no family or anything? I'm a little bit of a loner. I got something for you. Sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you, I just-- See, that's me and that's Stacy when we were kids. All right? I'm not some fucking lunatic that's going to kill you while you're sleeping. Yeah. If you don't mind me, I think I'm just going to crawl back into my little imagination here. What do you got here? DMT and salvia. Stacy, like, scored it off some Silicon Valley dude. Hmm. Fuck it, let's smoke them both at the same time. Okay, so, what's the difference between DMT and salvia? You've never smoked this shit before? No. All right. So, both, you know, they're both pretty fucking awesome. But with salvia, you can experience cartoon-like visuals, uncontrollable laughter, feeling of being stretched or twisted and, my personal favorite, believing that you're in more than once place at the same time. Holy shit. Yeah. Okay, what about DMT? Okay. Now, with DMT, the hallucinations are a little more visual. So, objects can sometimes turn into animals. And... the trip is really short, but sometimes it can feel like it lasts forever, even longer. Well, fuck. Um... all right, let's flip a coin for it. Good song. Heads I do DMT, tails salvia, vice versa. Okay. Fuck, I'm doing DMT. All right. I'm scared! Why, come on, don't be scared. Come on, we'll do them at the same time, all right? So, you really don't need too much. Go on, get in there. Oh my God. All right. On the count of three. Okay. One... two... three. Hold it in.

Like, you don't understand. Yo, Lindsey. Where you going, man? I'm just going to go to bed. Why don't you sleep down here? Sleep down here? Yeah, why don't you sleep down here, there's another room for you. To America, I just want to say wear your masks, stay home, stay safe, and just do your part, okay? Woo! I cannot believe that she just did that. Jake? Oof. What the fuck? Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I just, I got an early start, so I didn't want to wake you up. But, oh yeah, sorry about the blood on the porch. There was a deer in the middle of the road this morning, so I had to pull the fella off. Anyway, I changed out the old wires, and your Wi-Fi should be good to go. So, all I need is your Hancock here. Did you just see a guy here earlier? He has long hair. No, no, it's just you and me. All right. You have a good one. Yeah. Shit. You're not Sheriff Rodgers. Oh my God, you look so pretty, look at you! Do you really think so? I mean, I can put this wig on if you want me to. No, no, no, I love you just the way you are. Hey, you never going to believe what happened after the night that we were dancing. My wife, she heard the music, she came upstairs, we danced all night! I didn't know my girl was so much into Marc Anthony. See, what did I tell you? I'm happy for you guys. All night. Oh yeah, I think we in love. Uh-oh. What happened? I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm really tired. But I'm happy for you. You deserve something real. Hi, hubby. You lying, cheating little slut. Please don't talk to me like that. I can't believe I've been saving myself for a whore! I said, don't talk to me like that! Okay, wifey! Is someone there? Hey. What are you doing? Why are you chasing me? Chasing you? Why are you running from me? Have you seen Jake? Who? Stacy's cousin. No. Are you sure you're okay? What were you digging? A grave. What? I found a deer on the side of the road. The odor of a decomposing carcass tends to attract bears. Poor thing. Mind helping? So, how was the rest of your night? I was with you last night. No, I mean after I dropped you off. After you left, Stacy's cousin came over and we just hung out. Oh. Fun. It's a sin to leave the dead without a grave. Hey, would you grab my smokes? Yeah, sure. Where are they? On the bag. Right next to you. Oh my God, are you okay? My ankle! Would you give me a hand? Please? Thanks. Here you go. I don't know about you, but I'm starving. How about I cook us dinner? Come on, you're, you're hurt. I'm used to being hurt. Is there a sweater or a blanket that I could borrow? Sorry, I'm just freezing. Yeah, go upstairs. A bunch of my ex's stuff in the room. I'll fire up the stove. Okay. Sorry. Sorry! Fuck! I think you're really beautiful. Mmm. Kim and Max Daniels. They live next door, they're really cool, young couple. Unfortunately, they're gone. Gone? Dinner's ready. So, tell me more about you, Vicky. Not to pry, but when I was at your place the other night I noticed you had a webcam site open. If you don't mind me asking, what do you do on there? It's not a big deal. It's like, umm... Sharing content. Stuff like that. Uh-huh. Hmm. 18 & Over, that's what you're on, right? Mm-hmm. I've heard that site's become such a popular hub for sex workers that it's saturated the market. I didn't even know that was possible, oversaturating the world sex market. What a world we live in! Those poor suckers. Can you believe there's whores tricking men into falling in love with them for money! What did you put in my drink? Promises, promises. All I hear is false promises. But you're all the f-f-fucking same. Every... last... one of you. Guys, I have some bad news. One of you will be going home. One of you was beyond and put us all at risk. Kim, you're going home. Really, after all that? I was at a protest! No, bitch, you were at a party. The fuck was she thinking, going to a party? She's literally the one that always has a visor on her face! It's just not fair, okay! Bye. - It's okay, it's all right, it's all right. Come on, then, it's fine. - It's so sad. - Oh my God, get away! - Get out! I don't think it's fair. Like, give me a warning. I'll take another COVID test! So, that's what happens when you don't follow the rules. Actually, it was just one rule. All you guys had to do is stay in this mansion. Believe me, life could be worse. Everyone in America is doing the same thing right now. You're all very lucky to be here, so act like it. Hi, sleeping beauty. What did you do to me? Please, please, get me out of this. Why would you do this? Are you really asking me why? Do you have any idea what I've d-done to be with you? Please, please, you don't have to do this! You said you wanted to marry me. You said you wanted a ring. I got you a ring. I want you to put your money where your mouth is... wifey. Baby, did you really do this all for me? Why don't you uncuff me first? If you want to propose to me... I want you to do it right. How can you love me if you don't trust me? Trust is important. This was my grandmother's. I told my mom all about you, and she gave it to me for you. It's beautiful. Vicky, will you m-m... marry me? Yes. Holy shit. She, she said yes. She said yes. She said yes. You're a fucking liar. You're just trying to use me. Am I? Oh my God. I've always wanted you to be my husband. Baby, close your eyes. Because I'm going to blow your fucking mind. Fuck you! Ahh! No, no, no! Hey, hey, hey! Vicky! No! Vicky, Vicky, hey, hey, hey! It's me, it's me. Jake, Jake! Come here, come here. Jake! What happened, are you okay? No, he's going to kill me! - Who's going to kill you? - No, we don't have time! Who's going to kill you? Jake, please, listen to me, he's not Max. He killed the whole family, come on! Come here, talk to me! Stop, shh! He's here. Come on, Jake. Who is that? Please, trust me, we have to go! Jake! Go, go, go, now, go, get out of here, go! Who's there? Where the fuck are you? Where the fuck are you? Come on! Let's fucking go, huh! Where the fuck are you, you fucking-- Ah, fuck! Ahh, fuck! Hiya, Jake. What the fuck! Sheriff, it's me, Vicky. The Crowbar Killer, he's here! Please, please, you have to come here now! Please help me, please! Can you hear me? Help, please! Lou. Hey, Vi-- I'm at 56 Woodland Drive in Weed, California. There's someone trying to kill me, please, please, call for help! I'm calling them now, I'm calling them now. Honey... I'm home. I know I'm not the most... traditional guy. But I... do expect to be with my future wife the night we got engaged. Can we just talk about it? What the fuck! You fucking touch her! I'll come find you! I just called the cops, you crazy son of a bitch! Ahh! I killed that ungrateful boyfriend of yours. You know he wasn't right for you. You should be thanking me, you know. What else do I have to do to prove my love to you? Tell me! That wasn't very nice. Got to tell you, honey, you have been just as disappointing as the rest of those lying bitches. Vicky! Are you fucking kidding me right now? Let's go, mother fucker. Come on. God damn it! Sorry, buddy... nobody likes a third wheel. No! I always knew you'd stab me in the back, you b-b-bitch. Fuck you! It's over. I can't watch, I can't-- - Oh my God, girl, just-- Yeah, right? I knew it was him the whole time. I knew it was him the whole time! - You did not, you did not! Listen to what he's saying! Max, Max, Max, I knew it was him the whole time. Why did, how did you know? Literally why are you throwing popcorn? It's already a mess in here. Hey, yo, who was the Crowbar Killer? Max, you fucking idiot. But I thought for sure it was Jake. Like, literally, he was too good to be true, too nice, too much. Have you ever webcammed, yes or no? Of course, of course, newsflash, look it, look it. Of course. Nobody asked you, you analytical asshole. I can't believe that we're in a movie. A freaking movie! Seriously, though? Aren't you guys seeing what I'm seeing here. They're exploiting all of us. They're exploiting us! - I think you're being overdramatic. - Uh-uh-- You're so loud! Your face is loud! Oh! That's right, you heard me. And, girl, you're laughing! You're laughing! And you better shut up. Eat your cereal. Eat your cereal and shut up, please, thank you. Thank you! You know what, fuck you guys, I'm done. Do it again! Bye! This is why nobody likes you! All right, you know what-- Fuck you! It's just a stupid movie. Let's just get a drink-- And this movie is the exact reason why I'm not joining 18 & Over. I wonder if they do a sequel if they'll bring us back. Yo! Yo! You all want to hear my new song? No!
