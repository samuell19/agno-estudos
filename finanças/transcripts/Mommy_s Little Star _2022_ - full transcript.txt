Do you think that Mom's gonna like her present? Oh, she'll love it, sweetie. Can I help you? I'm here to see my mom. It's her birthday. Oh, how nice! What's your mom's name? Lauren Carrington. This is my second day. I don't have all the patients memorized yet. Oh! Everything OK? It looks like Lauren Carrington checked herself out last night. No! It's her birthday! She knew I was coming! She wouldn't leave! Sweetie... Uh, maybe I made a mistake. I can go check. It's OK. It wouldn't be the first time that she... You understand. Dad, why doesn't Mom want to see me? She does, honey. Your mom is just having a hard time right now. Morning, Hope. Morning. No Olivia yet? She won't come out of her room again. I'll go get her. I wanna stay with you, Mom. Olivia? Open up! Come on, Olivia. You're gonna be late for day camp. You OK, honey? Yeah, I'm fine. What's wrong? I always ask Mom if I could stay over at her house, and she keeps on saying no. Oh, sweetie, we talked about this. Your mom just needs a little more time. And as soon as she's ready, you can be there as much as you want. Does Mom not want to spend time with me? Oh, of course she does. She loves you very much. I know you miss her. Oh, Hope made waffles. And, uh, the next time she knocks on the door, open up, please. Hope makes me feel stupid. She's always telling me that I need to get better at reading and writing and... everything. She's just trying to help. I'll talk to her. Hm. Senior art director, Philadelphia Society Magazine. Please send resume, references, and a cover letter. Explain any employment gaps in detail. Hey, Felicity. Lauren? Where are you? I can come pick you up. No, no. I'll get a cab. I just need someone to talk to. Take the cab straight to my house, OK? Thank you. Thank you. Hope: Right after camp, we'll get started on your summer reading project, OK? Oh, I bought some fun new school supplies I think you'll really like. Olivia, you know, you're a smart girl. If you just put in a little extra effort, I know you'll pull up those grades. OK? Sure. All right. Let's go. Hey, girl! I have to show you something. One of my friends told me about this new app called Sparxy. It's so awesome. There are all these kids that have been getting super famous on here. And companies pay them a bunch of money just to make videos. This is Chloe. She just joined last week and already went viral. She got fifty thousand likes on her last post. What did she do? Just danced in the park. She must be a really talented. Mm. Her moves are kinda basic. But this other influencer shared it, and now she's blowing up. And her mom is in here too. Sometimes they make videos together. Chloe's always saying how her mom is her number-one fan. Really? Girls, you know the rules. Put the phones away! Well, you know how it is, reuniting with family after they've seen you at your worst. And now I'm travelling all the way to Europe to spend two weeks with them. I'm so sorry. It'll just take me a couple of minutes. I just have to take this. Of course. Go ahead. OK. Hey, um... Sorry, Brad. Now's not really a good time. Can I call you back? Is everything OK over there? Yeah. I'm just with somebody from my recovery group. I won't keep you. I was just calling about Olivia. She's been asking to stay over at your place. Well, you know I want that, too. It's just I need a little more time in recovery. I... I don't want her to ever see me like that again. Ah, I understand. I'm just trying to bridge things until then. Maybe we can all have dinner together this week. Yeah, I'd love that. Um, how about Thursday? Perfect. OK, good. I'm really glad you're spending time with friends again. Yeah, it's the first time in a while. I also was looking at jobs this morning. That's great, Lauren. I'm really proud of you. Thanks. I should, uh, I should really go. OK. We'll talk soon. Thanks for listening to me. Anytime. Dealing with family in early recovery is so difficult. Especially since the last time I saw them, I wasn't sober. You've been clean for how long? Four months. Does it get easier? It gets a little bit easier. And then, uh, in my experience, you hit a bump, but they say that's normal. Do you want to talk about what's going on with you? It's just I'm... I'm scared to have my daughter Olivia, stay with me. You know, I'm terrified of relapsing. It's just I don't wanna get her hopes up just to disappoint her again. Because of what happened? When you're drunk and you leave something on the stove and almost burn the house down with your kid inside... ...that image stays with you forever. I really wanna make videos for Sparxy! Maybe we can do something together. You can come over to my house today. Hope wants me to finish my summer reading. She'll never let me! What if I come over to your place instead? She won't like that either. If I say that I'm studying with you, she might. That's genius! Hey, look! This song is trending. Maybe we can make up a dance to it. I bet we can get some good views. Hope will get mad if we're not studying. Let's go to the other end of the pool where she can't see us. So how 'bout... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Oh, I love that! OK, and how 'bout we add a shoulder pop? Yeah, that's awesome! Should I just press record? Girls, you're supposed to be reading! Olivia, that was our deal. Sydney could come over as long as you did your homework. I'm sorry, Hope. We were just taking a quick break. Do you wanna dance with us? You wanna dance with me? Yeah. It's for this really fun social media app. Lots of kids on there complain about their nannies, but we can show you how cool you are. I kinda have two left feet. Don't worry. We'll show you the moves. It's super easy! Ready? Five, six, seven, eight... And... done! It looks so good. You should caption it with "my nanny's cooler than yours". I thought you said Hope was the worst. I mean, I don't hate her. I just don't like how she's always picking on me about school. I just wish I could be with my mom like before. Didn't your mom used to work though? Yeah, but she designs magazines and ads and stuff, so she always did work from home. That's cool. I mean, if you were an influencer like those really popular girls on Sparxy, you would totally need to live with your mom. What do you mean? Well, they get paid to work with all of these awesome brands, like fashion and jewelry. But you can't just take regular photos and videos. I mean, it has to be good if you're gonna get paid. Your mom could probably help with that. OK. I'm texting you the edited video. We can both upload it to our accounts at the same time. I already got a like. I got one, too! And comments! And more likes! I'm not getting as many as you. They like me. You mean they like us. I'm not good at school, or sports, or even theater stuff. But what if I can get awesome at this? I mean, what if I can get... famous? Liv, it's just one video. Hope: Olivia! Dinner time! Excuse me, miss. Did you drop this? Oh, my god, thank you. Um, I don't know how this even fell out of my purse. Uh, are you here alone? Um, I was supposed to meet a friend, but she can't make it. Ah, we have that in common. Someone bailed on me too. Oh. You know, this place has the best wine selection in Philly. Oh, well, um, I'm sober. Oh, So I am enjoying this l ime-and-lavender-infused seltzer, which is quite good actually. Well, they do a mean Branzino. Oh, well, now that sounds amazing. I think I'm just gonna head home though. I, I don't love eating by myself. Uh, same here. Unless you want some company? Those of us that get stood up by our friends should stick together, right? C'mon. Dinner on me. Um, do you return lost wallets to people and, uh, then you offer to buy them dinner? Um, what's your name? Aiden. You? OK, Aiden. Let's, let's, let's do it. Let's have dinner. Hey, honey. It's gettin' late. Time for bed. OK, Dad. I was thinking about our conversation this morning and I know you miss your mom. I spoke to her today and the three of us are going out on Thursday night. Really? Can I sleep over at her house after? No, honey. Sorry. Not yet. You know I love you more than anything, right? Love you too, Dad. Sleep tight. Oh, my god! She's got like millions of followers! I have to show Mom. It's my daughter. She just sent me a video. Aiden: Ohh! She's adorable! - Thank you. Um, yeah, she just downloaded some new social media app and she posted this video today and she already has ten thousand likes. Wow. Hey, besties... I know you've been loving the videos I make with my mom. She's pretty awesome, right? And I think it's really cool that she's so proud of me and loves this app as I much as I do! And I think it's really cool that she's so proud of me and loves this app as much as I do. I had,um, a really nice time. Thanks for dinner. Yeah. So did I. You know, um... Do you need to get that? No. It's nothing. Are you sure? It could be important if they're calling that late. He's just a friend in Germany. He's six hours ahead and clearly doesn't realize we're in different countries. I, um, I should get home. Uh, I'd love to see you again. Uh, do you wanna exchange numbers? Sure. Yeah? Um, here. You can just punch yours in. Here ya go. Thank you. Uh... Wasn't my brother's kid one of these influencers? The Stars Rising contest? What's that? Attention, stars. If you're brand new to Sparxy, you're eligible to win Five hundred thousand. Whichever influencer gets the most views by the end of the month wins. Where's my dad? Uh, he had to leave early for a meeting. Guess what we're gonna do? What? Well, since you've been struggling to finish all of your summer reading, I thought we'd make a goal board. Olivia? Olivia, can you pay attention for a minute? So, with your reading that's left over, we're gonna break it down into mini goals and we're gonna use the goal board to track it. And then... Olivia? Please, pay attention! This is important. Please. Fine. I'll finish my reading. Well, you keep saying that but it's almost August and you haven't completed any of your projects. One of the reasons your dad hired me is so that you wouldn't struggle so much in school this year. I know that I'm not good at school. I'm ready to leave for camp. I'll be outside. Wha-Olivia, what about your breakfast? I'm not hungry. What's up, man? Are you ignoring me? Of course not. You haven't returned any of my calls. It's been a little hectic over here. I hope you've been busy getting the money we owe these guys because they are breathing down my neck. Working on it. You sold a bunch of fake wine to the wrong people. You mean "we." I brought you those buyers as a favor. Now they're after me! They showed up here last night and want their money back by the end of the month. The hell? How are we gonna get a million dollars by then? I don't know, man. But we gotta figure something out or... I don't need to explain what's gonna happen. Dammit! Can't we just borrow it from your parents? They're done bailing me out. I'm cut off! It's bad enough I'm letting you shack up at one of their houses without them knowing. Why don't you call your parents? Your niece has gotta be making serious money. Come on, man. You know I burned that bridge already. My brother threatened to take a restraining order against me if I showed up anywhere near his family. But don't worry. I think I have an idea. (sigh) Something that could buy us some time. Who the hell is that? Calm down. It's someone I know. I let you crash there so you could find the damn money, not invite guests over! Yeah. It's all part of the plan. Good morning. You look beautiful. Thank you. You didn't answer my text about the Stars Rising contest! Sorry, I'm just trying to finish editing this video before camp starts so that I don't get in trouble by Miss Rhonda, the phone police. Did you enter? Of course. So did I. But... I need to win. I mean, you're already good at so many things, like you can act, and make costumes, and design sets. I need this! Girls! Let's go! Phones away! Neither of us will get first place anyway. We can't make any videos when we're stuck here at camp. Laurel: Wow! You weren't kidding. You are an excellent cook. I'm glad you enjoy it. And this property is amazing. I'm, I'm in design, not interiors, but, uh, I can definitely appreciate a beautiful space. Well, thank you. I'm not in that field but have a love for it. I'm an investor. I'm in wine futures. I may have already known that. Oh, really? Well, a stranger invites you over to his house for breakfast, you do some checking. Ah, not a complete stranger. We had dinner last night. And I'm an open book. OK. So, have you always worked in wine? No. Before I got into that business, I was in talent management. Really? I started out by managing my niece's career, Fiona Snow. Have, have you heard of her? I think I've seen her on the cover of one of those gossip magazines. She started out as just a kid on social media. She had a video that went viral, just like your daughter's. And then came the brand deals and the sponsorships. She turned the whole thing into an acting and music career. Wow! That's, that's really impressive. Do you still manage her? No. I got her signed with a much bigger talent agent. I was getting into the wine business, and I put her in excellent hands. You know, if your daughter's getting that many views already, she has real potential. And if her popularity continues to grow, she's gonna need someone she trusts to manage her career. Oh, I don't know if it's that serious. She's just a kid making videos for fun. Oh, sorry. Oh, it's, it's my ex-husband. I should get this. Of course. I was hoping that we could have dinner together with Olivia tonight instead. I have some clients coming in on Thursday now for a dinner meeting. Um, yeah. Tonight works great. Uh, where do you want to meet? How about that pizza place that she likes? Pizza Casori? How does six o'clock sound? -Perfect. OK. See you then. Everything OK? Yeah. Um, I'm having dinner with my daughter and my ex tonight. Oh, that's so nice that you guys have such a good co-parenting relationship. Yeah. We, um, we promised each other we'd stay on good terms for Olivia's sake. Well, you can tell Olivia that you showed me her video and she's got a new fan. And you should think about what I said. If she keeps getting this kind of attention, I'm happy to lend her any advice I can. I really appreciate that. Yeah. Hey. Hey. I was up all night last night trying to find the best projects to show Davrow Enterprises. This presentation needs to be perfect. I think we should plan to stay late tonight I can't. I have dinner planned with Lauren and Olivia. Oh, that's great. I know that you said Olivia has really been missing her. Yeah. And Lauren's not quite ready to have Olivia stay with her, needs some more time in recovery. That's understandable. It's been what... about four months now? Yeah. I'm really proud of her. I'm proud of both of you for how you handled all of it. Thank you for saying that. And look, Mom! I'm up to fifty thousand views on this video. And the one I posted this morning already has twenty thousand. That's, that's great, honey. And I entered this contest called Stars Rising. I only have a few weeks to win, but I have to make a bunch of videos that people will like. This one girl, Chloe, makes videos with her mom. Can we make one together? Of course, honey, um, if that would make you happy. But I'm at camp all the time and we're not allowed to be on our phones. Maybe I can come stay with you during this week and I don't have to go to camp. Olivia, camp is really good for you. You met a friend, and you love theater. Plus, you've gotta catch up on your summer homework so you can start off the school year strong. Maybe we should put the phone away for dinner? But I wanna show Mom one more thing! Well, let's, let's eat first. You can show me after, OK? It says Sparkles 22 likes your video on Sparxy. What is Sparxy? It's the app that I was telling Mom about. What happened to, to going outside and playing tag or building a fort? Oh, my god! You're Olivia Carrington? Yeah. That's me. I love your videos on Sparxy! You're my new favorite person to follow. Can we take a selfie together? If you tag me, I'll re-share it on my profile. Oh, my god! Really? You're so cool! I can't wait for your next video! You have actual fans. That's so exciting, honey. We should celebrate by getting some extra pepperoni on the pizza. For our daughter, the star. I did it. Can I have my money now? How'd she seem? Excited? I'm paying you fifty bucks, kid. You can answer my questions. Yeah, of course. All these kids trying to get famous are obsessed with attention. Lauren: Sweetie, if this is something you're interested in pursuing, maybe we should talk about getting you a manager. A what? A friend of mine who has experience in this sort of thing said it's good to get, um, talent representation. It protects Olivia, uh, especially if she's gonna be getting opportunities from this. We should talk about this in private. Hey, you. Hey. So I've been giving some thought to what you said about getting my daughter a manager and, uh, mind if I pick your brain about it a bit? Of course not. Do you wanna get together tomorrow? That sounds great. Actually, why don't you bring along your daughter? You wanna meet my daughter? Uh, just for the purpose of a potential career. It's important the kids have a say in these types of matters. Hm. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense, actually. Um, I'll figure out a place. Sounds great. Is it too soon to say that I miss you? No. I think that that's, uh, a good thing. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night. Good night. Bradley: They need us to go to Paris? I thought they said they were coming here. They want us to tour their building, stay for a week, and look at some of their other potential investments. A whole week? Brad, this account will double our company profits and open up a ton of other opportunities. But we have to leave in the morning and I'm still at the office working on our presentation. OK. Let's get it booked. Why don't you come here to the house before the flight? We'll work on the presentation and head to the airport together. Sounds good. Misha Webb, Spritzio Soda liaison. Core and Form Pilates... every day at 8am... Hey, honey? Yeah, Dad? Can you put your phone down for a second? I need to go to Paris for a week on business. Does that mean that I could stay over at Mom's house? Honey, you know your mom needs a little more time. But I already talked to Hope and she's happy to stay with you for the week. Hope is staying here? So, we'll spend most of the morning touring the property and then we'll present our concepts to the board. Are all the graphics ready to go? Yeah. Everything's synced up to the laptop. Hey, Olivia. Come say hello to Celine. Hi, Celine. Hi! Your dad was telling me all about your social media stuff. That's exciting. Thanks. It's really fun. Just don't get too distracted and forget about all your summer homework, OK? Yes, Dad. You know, my daughter uses that app. I even have an account. You do? Mm-hm. I'll follow you. Hey, uh, your mom texted. She's gonna pick you up later on and take you out for ice cream. She is? She must have gotten my text and already wants to celebrate. Celebrate what? Well, I'm getting all these really cool comments and likes on my latest video. Wow! You are really talented, honey. You are such a good dancer! Damn! Is everything OK? My tire's flat. I could change it for you if you have a spare. Really? Aren't you heading into a class? I'll skip a day. You'd better put that away before Miss Rhonda sees. Just one more sec. Hey, you wanna hang out after camp today? Can't. I'm seeing my mom. What? My latest video is getting so many likes, but I'm only in sixth place for the contest. You really think you can win? Yeah. Why? There's so many other kids competing and making like ten videos a day. Yeah, but they're not stuck here at camp like I am. But you're-- Are you mad at me or something? No. I just don't want you to be disappointed when you lose. I'm not going to lose! So, do you work? Unfortunately. I work for this awful brand called Spritzio Soda. That's the billion-dollar company? Yeah. Well, they certainly don't spread the wealth. I've been there for five years. I've never gotten a raise. I've been passed over for a promotion twice, both times for some fresh-out-of-college frat bro. Honestly, the only good thing about the job is that it's based in Manhattan, but they let me work from home here in Philly. Damn. What do you do there? I work in influencer relations and pretend to like all these little brats on the Sparxy app. None of them have any talent. It's ridiculous how much these kids get paid for a video. I make seventy thousand dollars a year. These kids make that in five posts. Huh. Yeah, my niece is involved in all that. She's in a contest right now. It's... Uh, yeah. The Stars Rising contest. That's the one. Yeah. Another genius idea by my idiot boss. Sorry. I don't wanna be rude to your niece, but it's just a shame she's involved in the whole influencer thing. It messes kids up. Yeah. Really shady stuff, huh? Oh, you wouldn't believe the things that I know. I'm gonna write a book one day, expose the entire industry. If you need to get some stuff off your chest, I'm a good listener. Are you trying to charm my secrets outta me? Oh, you think I'm charming? Honestly? No. I mean, you're very nice. You're just not exactly my type. That's fair. But since you despise your job, I think I know a way we can help each other out. Really? Hi, sweetie. I want you to meet my friend, Aiden. He knows a lot about social media, and I think he can help you with the contest. Really? Yeah. Your mom showed me some of your social media videos and, well, you've got real talent for this. You think so? Yeah. Hope, how are you? Hope: Hi! OK! Are we ready to go? Yeah! OK. Lauren: Seatbelts! Bradley: Hello? Hi, it's Hope. Lauren just came to pick up Olivia. There was a guy with her and, I don't know. I've never seen him before. Olivia: And there's all kinds of prizes that I can win. And I'll even get to star in a commercial! Soon you're gonna be on the cover of magazines. And I'm gonna frame every one of them and hang them everywhere. Hey. Bradley: Hope called and said there was a man who came with you to pick up Olivia. Is that true? Yes. Um, he's just a friend. Who is he? You don't know him. He's the one I told you about with the experience with the social media stuff. I thought it would be a good idea for Olivia to speak with him. I really wish you would've run it by me first. Why? Do you need a file on every one of my friends? No, but I have a right to know who's around my daughter. Brad, you're overreacting. I just-I don't want someone around Olivia I haven't met. Really? So have I met everyone that's been around Olivia with you? I think you introduced her to Hope before I ever met her. OK. Point taken. Uh, still, I would feel more comfortable if we could discuss these things first. Hey. Um, so I used to manage my niece's career when she did social media stuff. Fiona Snow, uh, have you heard of her? Oh, my god, yes! -- Yes? You managed her? It was a while back now. But, um, she's getting TV and movie deals now. Tell me a little bit about this Rising Star contest. Maybe I can help. Whoever gets the most views wins. So that means they have to make a bunch of videos, but I'm stuck at camp all day during the week. You can't make videos there? No. My camp counselor, Miss Rhonda, is crazy strict and she doesn't let us use our phones. She's always the first one there and never lets us out of her sight. Good to know. You know, I have the perfect house for social media content. It's got tons of light and really cool spaces. You could use it whenever you want, Olivia. Really? Can we? Um, that's something we should discuss with your father first, OK? OK, Mom. All right. Bye, honey. Bye! I told you, I'm working on it. There's just a few more things in my way. Olivia: Dad, are you mad at Mom? No, honey. Why? Because you were arguing with her on the phone earlier. Oh, we just had a little disagreement. Nothing for you to worry about. Was it about her new friend, Aiden? Because he's really nice Aiden's his name? Did Mom say how she knows him? No. But he gave me a bunch of fun ideas for the Stars Rising contest. He even said that I can make a bunch of videos at his house. Uh, sweetie, I don't know if I feel comfortable with you spending time with a stranger, at least not until I can meet him. But you're gone all week. When I get back into town, maybe we can all have dinner together. Deal? Deal. Uh, I should, uh, get some sleep. It's three a.m. here. I love you. Love you too, Dad. Hey, Hope. Olivia! I didn't even hear you come in. Sydney was wondering if I could go over to her house today after camp. I was hoping we'd get to some of your summer homework today. Why don't you come home after camp and then you can go to Sydney's after? OK. Yeah? OK. There's your breakfast. I wonder what's going on. Hey, what's happening? Somebody attacked Miss Rhonda in the parking lot this morning. Her knee's broken. I don't know if it's safe for you girls to be here. I'm gonna go talk to one of the counselors, OK? It's really sad about Miss Rhonda. I guess you can use your phone at camp now and make videos for the contest, since that's all you seem to care about lately. I told you! My mom and dad finally think that I'm good at something! They're proud of me! I don't understand you, Liv. Why, because you think I'm not talented? I didn't say that! --Well, you're wrong! Who? I even have a manager that wants to represent me. My mom's friend that used to manage Fiona Snow, and now he's interested in me. Oh, really? What's his name? Aiden! Your parents aren't gonna love you more just because you get likes on social media. Call me when you're done being obsessed with fame. Misha: If you're Olivia's acting manager, we can have the cheque made out to your company. Easy. But you need a parental signature on the forms though. Can it be forged? What do I care? And then you'll give me half of the money in cash. Of course, partner. God, I can't wait to screw over this company. Except 500k isn't exactly a lot when you're raking in billions. Won't your family disown you or something for stealing money from your niece? I'm not even actually related. The reason that I actually need-- No, stop. Don't say another word. I don't wanna get wrapped up in whatever mess you've got going on. We just need to make sure Olivia wins and then we get our payout. I've I already taken care of one problem. And the kid? She's actually talented. And the more videos she makes, the more views she gets... and we get our money. Cheers to that. I'm done my book report. Good job. I'll take my bike over to Sydney's house now. Oh, I'll drive you. No! It's OK. She's just up Carpenter Street. And besides, we wanna ride our bikes together. Her mom can drop me off later tonight. OK. I'm a little surprised you're still going over to Sydney's house. Why? I saw the two of you earlier at camp, arguing. No, we weren't. It certainly looked like it. Oh! I know what you're talking about. Uh, we were just acting out a scene from camp. That's all. It was all just pretend. OK. Have fun then. Thanks, Hope. Olivia! Where is she going? That's the opposite direction of Carpenter Street. Olivia, pull over! Where are you going? I'm going to meet Sydney! I told you! Why are you following me like a stalker? Because I am in charge of you! And you know what? Sydney's house is the opposite direction. We decided to meet at the park! Olivia, get in the car. No! I don't believe that you're going to Sydney's house, and I think you lied to me! You were fighting with her earlier at camp. I'm not lying! I'm just gonna call your father. No! You can't call him! He'll know I lied and won't let me finish the competition! It'll ruin everything! Olivia, that's not true. Just stay right here, OK? Honey, what's wrong? Mom... I have to tell you something. Hey. Um, I have some bad news. Don't panic. Olivia's here with me. I just, uh, Hope's in the hospital. She had an accident. What happened? Hold on. I'm gonna go in the other room. I just spoke to the hospital and Hope's gonna be OK. Wh-what did Dad say? Is he mad at me? No. Honey, he's not angry. He's just worried. But you're gonna stay here with me until he comes home from Paris, OK? I can live here with, with you? Yes, for, for the week. Can we make videos tonight for social media? There's this other mom and daughter who do all these fun dances and get a bunch of views! Why don't we take a break from your phone tonight? But... but the contest, Mom, I could actually win. Don't you, don't you like watching my videos? Of course I do. I love watching you dance. But let's just not focus on that for tonight. Aiden: Why isn't this kid making any damn videos? Do you have... an eight? Go fish. Aren't you going to answer that, Mom? It's Aiden. Oh. I can call him back later. We're in the middle of a very important game here. Last card. Do you have a ten? Go fish. Oy! Why isn't she picking up? All right, sweetie. I think we should be getting to bed. It is getting pretty late. Who could that be? Hey! What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. I hope that's OK. Uh, thank you. These are beautiful. Um, now's not exactly a good time. Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't realize Olivia was here. Well, we had quite the interesting day, so she's gonna be staying with me this week. Hi, Aiden! Hey, kiddo. Um, how's the contest going? Not so good. I don't think that I'm gonna win. Oh, really? Is there anything I can help out with? Maybe. Is it OK if I stick around for a few minutes? Give her some advice? Uh, sure. I will go put these in water. So, tell me, um, what's going on with the contest? I messed up really bad today and my mom wants me to take a break from social media. But you wanna win, don't you? It's just for tonight. And yeah, I really wanna show my mom and dad that I can do it. Can you help? Yeah. That's what I'm here for. This one already hit one hundred thousand! Hey, besties! I'm almost at one million likes for all of my videos! Thank you guys so much for all your support! Love ya! Come do this dance with me! OK. I don't think I have a choice. I don't even know what we're doing. OK. Out, and in. And out, and up. Oh, no. One, two, three, four. Mom! Oh, my God! I'm in second place! Yes! It says her manager is some guy named Brian. Hello to you too. You've been so mean to me lately. I really don't want to talk to you. I just wanted to call and let you know that your new manager is a fake. What are you talking about? I went on Fiona Snow's website. It says her manager is some guy named Brian. Because Aiden doesn't represent her anymore. He used to. Yeah, OK. I still don't buy it. I don't care what you think! Who was that? Just this girl Sydney that I go to camp with. Oh, yeah? Is she a new friend? I thought she was. But now she's just jealous that I'm more popular than her on social media. Mm. That's no fun. Wanna watch a movie? Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Aiden: Stuck in second place. Hi. You've reached Lauren Carrington. Please leave a message. Hey. It's me. Um, just wanted to see if you wanted to use my house to make some videos with Olivia on Saturday. All the influencer kids rent these things for their content, but you can use mine for free. I can text you the code. OK. Call me. Wow! This place is so cool! Look at this house! It's amazing! Wait till you see inside. Oh, right. It's so big! --I know. Perfect. Go ahead. Whoa! Why couldn't we meet at your house? I've got company. Well, I've got bad news. My boss decided who he wants to win the contest, and it's not Olivia. What? It's voted on by the public. Do you think the company cares about that? No. He wants that girl Chloe to win. Why does he care? Because he's screwing her mom? Can you prove it? Yeah. I can get some proof. Olivia: Woo-hoo! Mom! Look! I'm so close to winning the contest! That's great, sweetie. And look. This company that makes super cute jewelry just DM'd me that they wanna sponsor me! Wow! Well, we should definitely talk to Aiden before responding. He knows how to handle this sort of deal. Your dad is coming home tomorrow morning. I bet you're pretty excited to see him. I am. But since I stayed with you this week, does that mean that I can come here more? Absolutely. All payments for Olivia Carrington will be made directly to Aiden Lennox Management. Huh. A video of the boss and Chloe's mom. Hope it's enough to put Olivia in first place. Money's coming, man. You need to watch your back. Those guys know where you are. What? They're in Germany. How would they know? They got impatient. Said they were coming to find you and somehow figured out you were in Philly. I'm flying out there tonight. But I'm so close to getting this money. Hold them off! Theo? Hello? Dammit! I knew it was a lie. There's your dad. Hey, sweetie. Hi. Hey. Here ya go. Thanks. I'll take your bag inside. Say goodbye to your mom. I love you, honey. And I'm crossing my fingers for that contest. I'll see you soon. What are you doing here? You didn't get my text? No, I didn't get it. You couldn't talk to me at camp on Monday? All you do is ignore me there. Anyway, I just wanted you to know that your mom's friend is a fake. What? That guy, Aiden. He never managed Fiona Snow! You're lying. Just, just please stop! Hey. I'm Olivia's mom. I know. Do you wanna tell me what you two were talking about? I think you should just ask her. She's already so mad at me. I, I don't wanna get more involved. Lennox gained experience with Pass Bridge Trust Investments before striking out on his own. Thank you for calling Brian Page Talent Management. We are open Monday through Friday. 9 am to 6pm. If you would like to leave us a message... Saturday. Of course they're not open. So how's Olivia doing? She's good. Apparently, she's in second place in that social media contest. She's upstairs right now making more videos. That's so great. You know, I've been meaning to check out her profile. Well, enjoy the rest of your stay in Paris and I will see you at the office on Monday. Yeah. Enjoy your day. Ah, so cute. Look at this house! It's amazing! Look at this house! Wait a minute.t's-- No, it can't be. What's Olivia doing at my client's house? Judge forced to resign from the Stars Rising contest after attempting to falsify voting results. The winner is set to receive five hundred thousand dollars. Judge was having an affair with the mother of contestant Chloe Reynolds. Oh, my god. The contest will continue with results being announced tomorrow, says Spritzio Soda liaison Misha Webb. Hm. Maybe this Misha has some information. The contest ends tomorrow. You know, if your daughter is getting that many views already, she has real potential. And, if her popularity continues to grow, she's gonna need someone she trusts to manage her career. If Olivia wins, she gets five hundred thousand dollars. Bradley: OK. Thanks, Celine. Honey, I just got off the phone with Celine. Let me see your phone. Why? Can you pull up your profile on that social media app? Did you take this in front of that man Aiden's house? I'm calling your mom. Dad, are you angry? Just stay here. Aiden wasn't even home when we went to his house! I don't want Olivia around a stranger I haven't met, especially in a house that he doesn't even own. What are you talking about? That house belongs to one of Celine's clients, the Montag family. They spend most of the year in Europe and they only use the house when they're in town, which isn't very often. Montag? Aiden's last name is Lennox. Well, maybe you should ask him why he's living in someone else's house. Um, I, I have to call you back. Lauren, we really need to talk. Why did you tell me that was your house? Can I stay over at Mom's again next week? Maybe a sleepover next weekend? Ah, I don't know, honey. I think you should stay here until your mom and I can figure some things out, OK? Aiden: Why would Lauren call you? Misha: She left a message on my work voicemail. Don't worry. I won't be calling her back. Good thing this damn contest is over soon. Did she ask for anything? Something about paperwork if Olivia wins. Why the hell is she asking for that? Does it matter? The money is going into your account. Just keep things cool with her until tomorrow. I gotta go. Oh, my god! Lauren: Hello? Mom, I won! I won! That's great sweetheart. Aren't you excited? Can I see you tomorrow to celebrate? Mom, are you listening? Why don't I pick you up at day camp tomorrow and, um... I, I've gotta go, OK. I, I love you. Oh... OK. Hey! What are you doing here? I haven't heard from you, and I was getting worried. Oh, uh, I, I'm fine. I've just been really busy. Is Olivia here? No. Uh, she's back at her father's. Can I come in then? Um, now's just not really a good time. How come? Well, someone, uh, from my recovery group is coming over and it's a bit of a difficult situation. I just want her to feel safe. I understand. Of course. Uh-huh. Why don't I come over to your house for lunch tomorrow? I'm out all afternoon. How 'bout we do dinner tomorrow night? Perfect. Perfect. OK. Uh... I'll see you tomorrow? Goodnight. Hey! You OK? Yeah, Dad. Just won a huge contest. I thought you'd be doing back flips. I'm happy. Your mom's gonna pick you up after camp. Maybe we could, uh, all go out for dinner and celebrate your big win? I don't really think that Mom cares. What? That's not true at all, honey. Why would you think that? Gotta go. Love you. Love you. I don't want Olivia around a stranger I haven't met, especially in a house that he doesn't even own. Good. He's not home. What the hell is she up to? Not a single photo. Of course. Oh, my god. Who the hell are you? Aiden: Lauren? Lauren, are you up there? What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. How did you get in? You gave me the code, remember? When you let me and Olivia use the house over the weekend? Oh! You didn't think to call before you came inside my house? You said you were busy today. Besides, like I said, I wanted to surprise you. Oh! Uh, you forgot something downstairs. Thanks. I mean, not so fast. Oh, I, um, I need to go. Oh, I thought you were waiting for me. I just remembered I have to pick Olivia up at day camp soon. I'm sure she can get a ride with your husband. Of course. I just need my phone to call him. Oh. Oh, you didn't think I was just gonna hand this over, did you? Uh... I'm very good at reading people, Lauren, and there's something that you're not telling me. You're not going anywhere. This is my personal favorite. But if we want to, we could also do the residential. Yeah. I like that. I really like this one. Who are you? Does it really matter? I can't believe I ever trusted you, Aiden... or whatever your name is. You believed me because you were lonely, and you had regrets, addiction. I mean, what better way to take away your pain than to get lost in a guy you don't even know? So, what? You're just some con man? Why are you doing this to me? Your daughter is the ticket to getting rid of some of my regrets. Excuse me? The cash prize she's about to win? That gets transferred right into my bank account today. That's not possible. You're lying. You did some research on me. Maybe you should have taken more time to figure out where the contest money goes. Come on, Mom. Liv, what's wrong? My mom, she's... she's not coming. I don't understand. I thought that she wanted me to win the contest and that she was proud of me but... she just left me here. I'm so sorry, Liv. My mom can give you a ride home if you want. Do you think this is because of her weird friend? What do you mean? That guy, Aiden. I mean, he obviously lied about being a talent manager. Maybe your mom isn't here because she's with him. Come on. We can call her outside. So what's your plan? You're just gonna kill me? I haven't decided yet. The good thing is, you used to be an addict, so when you go missing, not that many people will be concerned. Don't make a sound. Hey, Olivia. Congratulations, I saw that you were in first place. You won! Do you know where my mom is? She's not feeling too well, kiddo. We're out of town and she had a bit of a rough night. Can I talk to her? Uh, she's sleeping right now, and I think it'd be kinda hard to wake her up. Like I said, long night. Can you have her call me when she wakes up? Sure thing. You're sick! You know that? You have no idea. You think you're gonna get away with this? He said that they were out of town. But then why would my mom tell my dad that she was going to pick me up today? Wouldn't be the first time he lied. It's my dad. Good luck, Liv. Dad? Sorry I missed you, honey. Is everything OK? I don't think so. What's wrong? It's Mom. There's no way you're gonna get that money. You can keep me here all you want! Olivia's father's gonna stop that transfer! Uh, no he won't. Misha: Aiden, I was just about to call you. They were about to transfer the money. Well, isn't that good news? But they told me it won't be in your account until tomorrow. What? You said today! I'm sorry. I tried everything. Hack into the system! I don't care what you have to do! I don't know how to do that! Figure it the hell out! Looks like we might need to get comfortable. Come on, sweetie. Get in. I'm gonna track down your mom. Dad, I don't think that Aiden was telling the truth. Do you remember the address of his house that you went to? No. I'll call Celine. It's one of her clients. We'll get the address to the cops. 911. What's your emergency? There's an emergency at 1276 Roberts Street. I believe my ex-wife is in danger. Sending officers now, sir. Hey. I called them back and they're still not budging, Aiden. There's nothing else I can do. I'm sorry. Dammit! Sit down! It looks like we're not going anywhere until tomorrow when that money's in my account. I didn't know (what I did). I didn't think... I just... Mom! We knew there was something wrong, so we called the cops. So brave and so smart. I'm so proud of you. Both of you. Glad you're OK. So. Someone from Spritzio called me today and they wanted to talk about the Stars Rising contest. Why? It was shut down. The president of the company was fired. And didn't that other woman, Misha, go to jail? Yes. But they feel terrible for Olivia. Regardless of what happened, she still really earned that win. So, they wanna give her fifty-thousand dollars towards her college fund, and they wanna discuss a brand deal. Do you think Olivia'd be interested? I don't know. But I think we should ask her what she wants. Hey sweetie, come over here! So I just found out that the Spritzio Soda people wanna offer you sponsorship money for college. And they wanna know if you'd be interested in making some videos for them. What do you think? That's cool, Liv! All right! I have burgers! Mm. Ah! Thank you, Hope. Would you like that, honey? I mean, I don't know. Hope's been helping me with a bunch of extra credit for school and I haven't really been using social media that much anymore. Can I think about it? Of course! Why don't we eat? Oh! You sit. I'll get these going. OK. Who said no cheese? I did. You did? Yeah. That's my girl, just like me.
