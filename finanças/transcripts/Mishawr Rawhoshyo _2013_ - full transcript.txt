We see Sphinx and we see great pyramid of Khufu! We see famous pyramid of Kafre. Now, not very famous but very interesting tomb. Come. Come with me. Come. Come. Mind your step. Come please. This way. Careful. Careful. One by one. Come. Careful. Mind your step please. Come carefully. This is the tomb of queen Hetepheres or you can call it the 'Ghost Tomb'. Careful madam, careful. No sir, no picture inside the tunnel please. Come with me, I'll tell you why it is a Ghost Pyramid. This way, careful. And we will reach the main hall. Ladies and gentleman, Queen Hetepheres! Sometimes Queen is in the mummy, sometimes goes walking. Don't worry. Only rumor. Story. The Queen Hetepheres is the mother of the King Khufu. And the pyramid was discovered in the year 1925. Ibrahim, come on. Now we will see the Queen sleeping inside this for years and years. Come down, Ibrahim. See the mummy... Oh God! Run! Run! The curse is back! Run! The curse is back! Run! The curse is back! Has the professor arrived?- - Yes, sir. Waiting in your room. And the minister?- - Yes, sir. He too. Good. First, the minister. Then, the professor. Long live the revolution! Hello Professor! Welcome to Egypt! THE EGYPTIAN MYSTERY Sir... Hello sir... Come sit.- - Thank you. Please keep sitting. Sit, I'll get down soon. Come. Get down whenever. I promise I won't stop you. Keep sitting till then. I'm good. How long will you stand like that? Don't worry. Sit, these seats are for you guys. You're making a mistake. The seats are for handicapped people, like you. Huh?- - Yes. Actually you are both blind and deaf. Neither can you see that I'm comfortable standing nor can you hear that I'm saying I don't want to sit. Thus, it is you who must sit here because it's for unfortunate people like you that they've these privileges. When are your selection test results? March. Do something worthwhile instead of sitting idle till then. God knows when Raja gets a case and then you both set out. Is it all true, what's written in the books? Or exaggerated for the publisher? They censor it, so you don't get worried and keep me and even Kakababu locked up at home. Right! His mother couldn't do it all these years, nor could your father and I will lock him up at home? No, that's alright. I was saying, don't sit idle at home and waste time. Learn a foreign language, learn computers. Can I learn Salsa? What! Salsa. Latin American dance form. Great! My son will learn how to dance now? What was that... Salsa! Don't bother Dada. You better concentrate on your Hilsa. Having pickle with an empty stomach leads to acidity. Where's the car? How did you come? Still at the garage. Couldn't find a taxi. So... took a bus. Chicken?- - No. How's the fish?- - Nice. NRIs have started coming back to the country from Cairo. Egypt is up in arms for the removal of the President. Poverty, unemployment and corruption has led to demands for the removal of the President. Thousands of people protested last Tuesday with this demand. The Headquarters of the National Democratic Party was set on fire by the protesters on Friday. At least 45 people died in the conflict. Wonder why all this violence! Wonder who helps them in these activities! The minister's assembly was declared to be annulled but that hasn't doused the fire of public protests at all. Why would I want to impress girls? Can't the bike skid by itself? In any case, it wasn't my mistake. No! No! No, I can't apply all that medicine. Anyway the patient is alone once you leave. By the way, when are we leaving? Anyway, I'm home. I better sneak in silently or Mom will give me a proper scolding. And if Dad's home then I'm... anyway. I'll give you a call in some time. Me too. Then someone told me that you know Hieroglyphics. You are the man! I came all the way to Kolkata looking for you. So, that's the complete story. So hurry up and come down. He gets started anytime. I get that Mr. Mamun, but now tell me, why choose me for this? As far as I know in the year 1820 Jean Francois Champollion had deciphered it completely. Yes. And these days you'll find at least two to three Egyptologists in every country. Yes, that is correct but there are only very few people who can read it easily. Because this is the most difficult part of Egyptology. And I've tried to contact many many people. You know Harold Petri, he tried for a long time. Nothing came of it. Laura Eisenstein. She tried. Nothing. Also Maqsood Alam. But... Then Huang Lee also. Zero. Only you are left. You are our last hope Mr. Roy Choudhury. Can I offer you smoke? Sorry, I quit. Oh. Then I should not smoke also. What about Lord Pembroke? Lord Pembroke... yes. Dead. Gone. Finished. Died in a car accident. The Police says he was... killed. Mr. Mamun, tell me honestly, what do you think, after taking up this case how long will I remain alive? What? You joking? You joking! With me! I thought... for a minute I thought... what is he saying! Good joke. But... you will have to do something Mr. Roy Choudhury. I've come to you with a lot of hope. Welcome to the show on Fever FM. Coming up now is a superhit song from a 1958 film. Keep listening and keep sending in your requests. (song playing) Show me. Where are you hurt? As in? I know it's not easy to walk around normally with a limp. Have gone through a lot with this leg. From Afghanistan to Arthrodesis! Were you in a meeting or spying on me? Why? Can't my senses work in unision if I am not a detective? Who was that man, Kakababu? Not 'was'. He still is. A sweet maker. Came to teach me a recipe. Give me your leg. Come on, show me.- - It's nothing much. I fell from the bike and sprained my ankle. A little turmeric will... Oh my God! You can learn about many different remedies if you've stayed in the hills. Where sympathy works better than Homeopathy or Allopathy. It's still swollen but the pain is nearly...- It will recede. And if it doesn't Apply this. Okay. And listen, Avinash da was saying, that Marwari businessman who got killed in their locality, the Police is clueless. So.. if you could...- Told you; not my job to catch petty thieves and murderers. Mr. Ray and Mr. Banerjee have spoiled you guys. Everyone has to grow up to be a detective. So what do I tell him? Should I bunk the topic? As in skirt the issue? No. Tell him Kakababu said that lizards and dinosaurs may belong to the same family but they're not the same thing. (song playing) Matches? (song playing) Holy crap! Can you imagine this! Can't you drive properly! Please tell me, who was he?- - Told you, Thomas Alva Edison, was teaching me how to make a bulb. You are such a...- - Stop sniffing out adventure anywhere and everywhere. Or you'll turn into a bomb squad alsatian gradually. Enough of being a Tintin. Now focus on studies for some time. But there is no pressure now. Holidays are on. And I did learn swimming, Karate, as you suggested and unravelled so many mysteries worldwide with you. No more mysteries, no more thrills. Tell yourself they're both on vacation or are sitting home like me, with a VRS. Though I did find a mystery which needs to be solved. Mystery! What is it? Please tell me! Bermuda Triangle? El dorado? Atlantis? Or is it... oh, okay wait! UFO? The same lad who'd not wake up before 10 am goes for early morning walks these days. The same lad who'd play football in the mud all day these days, takes a bath in the evening, empties half a bottle of perfume and sets out chewing mints. Who's the girl?- - Huh? Who is the girl? Girl? Which girl? Where did she come from? I don't know any girl. Yes Mom. Mom is calling. Wait. Focus on something constructive if you don't have studies. What constructive? I am doing... Karate.. and...- - Listen. I'll be out of town for work. Don't pester your parents. Work! Work as in? Come on! Tell me, what work? Please tell me! At least tell me where you're going. Come on tell me! (song playing) (Funeral procession) Lord, bless the noble soul. Lord, bless the noble soul. Lord, bless the noble soul. Sad evening for Professor Jha today. Who's he?- - Warden at the Narmada Hostel. He too is from CHS. I teach Ancient History. He teaches Modern. These boys are from the Narmada Hostel. The TV has not been working for many days. There were complaints but the TV wasn't replaced. Now they're parading to Mr. Jha. The madness has remained intact, isn't it? Absolutely. But Raja da, now tell me, why put up at JNU of all places? As in you've worked at the Archeological Survey for so long. You could've stayed anywhere. That I could. But I need to reaffirm certain things from you. Reaffirm? From me? I can't fathom this double meaning language you use. Not double. Only one language. Tell me if I remember correctly. Which language? Egyptian Hieroglyphics. What! Sit... Sit. Yes. Had your tea and snacks? See, I gave you some work and you could not do it. So if I shoot you right now will I be doing anything wrong? Why are you sitting like a statue? Forgive us, won't happen again. There is no 'again' anymore. That can happen only if you live any longer. It was a close shave. It is a close shave for you, son. I didn't take up arms to kill rats like you. Give me another chance..- - Are you crazy? Gave you a simple assignment. You failed! How on earth will you do a tougher job? Get Hossem for me. He is my man. He'll do it. I learnt this magic in Peru. I was sitting at Machu Pichu, all of a sudden, an old man appears. Looked like an actual Inca. He kept explaining to me in his own language. And I could not understand a thing. And so on, when... Oh God! Will you show the magic trick! Snigdha, in this entire to and fro between countries, Rini's education does not get affected? Not really. Besides, Rini is used to it now. Now choose one of these. Come on. Take one out. Oh, you'll take that one? Sure. She's been living with us since our parents passed away and she's studied in an international school so there's a parity. There's a standardized- - Now I'm shuffling it. So, she doesn't stick out in a crowd. Here! This is your card. Heard a lot from Shantu's sister about you and Sidhharth. Hope you've had a good stay in Kolkata so far. So, the previous card, here, this one... Why is the edge folded? And why did you shuffle only from the top? So you got it? See, he found me out! Smart boy! Fact is, how will a magic from Peru work in Kolkata? Magic is quite an art if you don't get caught. What's going on downstairs? Did we miss something? Come let's see.- - Let's go. Very funny. If you get the chance to examine a magician closely after every trick then anyone can get it. No big deal. That's a valid point. Did I say it's a big deal?- - She's joking. Not now. But you may blow your own trumpet later. The way you boasted about your adventures the other day... Which day? Which day? Which day? Err... what's on menu for tonight? A goat? Look behind you bloody fool! Let's go, dinner is ready. Sorry.- - Don't worry. Mom will calm down after a few days of grumbling. I don't think so. I think she is extremely mad at you and me. Oh God! Told you I'll manage. See, first I'll convince Dad. And then I'll...- - What if they don't agree? Why won't they? This is 2010, Rini. She's a bit worried about my career. That's all. And then you're an year elder to me so... that's a bit of a you know. I hope you realise that this is not a holiday fling. Or a high school crush. Or is it? Kakababu. Yes, hello. Hello. How are you guys doing? How are your parents? Everyone's good. And you? Why does your voice sound weird? Got fever after coming here. Work is not progressing. Not bringing you along was a mistake. Tell your Dad and come to Delhi tomorrow. A ticket will be kept for you at the Kolkata airport. And a man will recieve you at the Delhi airport. Will you manage? No problem right? Got to Mount Everest and the African jungles... this is only Delhi.. as in...- Good. And listen, carry your passport. Passport! Where are we going? Tell me please! Who was that man? Film maker Subhash Ghai. He's giving me a break. Goodnight. Come, let's go. Couldn't you call from the ambulance? Hey Sukhwinder, get the stretcher man! He'd get it if I called from ambulance. Very intelligent boy. He'd worry for no reason.- - Anyone will worry Raja. The bullet brushed past your ribs. It's a bullet's wound for God's sake! I've been seeing this for years now it's easier to crack our CBI cases than to argue with you. You talk a lot. Come on. One minute.- - What now? When did this happen? A few days ago, sir. God knows when he woke up. I woke up to see him walk towards the other room. I went in and saw, Baba Peer is sitting there. Sketching the same pictures. Okay. Tell his disciples that the gathering will be off for a few days. Tell them... he isn't well.- - As you say, sir. Hafiz. Yes, sir. Inform Ibrahim in Kolkata, Mr. Roy Choudhury's nephew's coming today. There is no problem here. Follow him, protect him there. Nothing should happen to that boy. Not even a scratch until he's on the flight. That Son of the Devil planned the attack last night. He may do anything, any moment. Got it?- - Yes, sir. Go. You won't get through. Kakababu's phone is switched off. Routine check up at the nursing home. As in? Kakababu sent a car. Come, let's leave fast. But why the nursing home? What's wrong? Shall we? (song playing) You? I assigned you the job. You took it. You came here. So you are my responsibility. But this thing what happened... very unfortunate. And I am sorry. You must punish me. Please. He who's been punished with this handicap, how can he punish you? Mr. Mamun, why don't you get it, I'm not anyone's responsibility, or anyone's slave. You invited me here, thank you. While I'm on this job if my life's in danger then it's my.. - No Mr. Roy Choudhury. That is your greatness. Mr. Mamun, this could be an old enemy of mine who has no... - Yes, that is correct. But I feel bad you know. I feel responsible.- - Oh forget it, Mr. Mamun. Tell me, has your uncle sketched any new pictures? Yes. He sketched a few some days ago. I'd like to show you but... your condition is...- - Oh don't worry. I'm good. I want to see those pictures. Okay, sure. I will bring them here for you. Tomorrow. But what do you think? What is he trying to say through these pictures? Don't know. I've understood parts of it. But to get the entire story Mohammad must go to the mountain. What happened? Got scared? Not at all. Why get scared? Heard the TV and... got a bit puzzled you know. Puzzled? As in? As in I got confused. Actually, I feel I'm a part of a spy thriller. Strangers are escorting me from one place to another. So... Not sure of the 'spy' bit. But thriller definitely. After what happened to Raja...- - Why? Fever is a common thing. What's thrilling about it? Oh yes. That's what Raja told you. Right. Told me, as in? What happened to Kakababu? Why're you getting angry? Didn't inform because you'd worry. And getting worked up is a bad thing. We need to keep our cool, right? Nothing has happened to me. I am fit and fine. The bullet brushed past my ribs. So, a small injury. Let's introduce you. Stop frowning. He is anyway very embarrassed. He thinks he is responsible for this. Let me introduce you to my nephew, Mr. Mamun. Very brave lad. He accompanies me to many places as my assistant. Hello my friend. And he, Mr. Al Mamun, a very famous businessman. He was based in Delhi in India for a long time for his business. Though he was born and brought up in Egypt. What? Err... no, nothing. Hello.- - Hello. Excuse me now. I'll let you know. Soon.- - Thank you. See you.- - See you. Bright boy huh! Raja, you better explain things to Shantu. Or the boy will die of curiosity. You go ahead. Okay, so... let me do the honors. Huh? Shantu, to understand this case you must first understand the concept of Hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics is...- - Yes. An ancient Egyptian language that uses pictures to communicate. I know. Go on.- - Holy Christ! Watching The History Channel instead of studying. Continue Naren.- - Yes. So this Mr. Al Mamun...- - One second. Sorry to interrupt you. Let me guess? This Mr. Al Mamun has found something written in Hieroglyphics which he wants Kakababu to decipher, right? Raja, it's obvious he's your nephew. Leave it Naren. I'll take it from here. Mufti Mohammad is a distant uncle of Al Mamun. From Egypt. About hundred years of age. A spiritual man. Doesn't speak. Only signals. Has numerous disciples in numerous countries. Because of his deteriorating health, Al Mamun brought him to Delhi, for his treatment. After coming here, one night he woke up and started sketching those pictures. In fact even now he often sketches those pictures. Al Mamun figured the moment he saw it that it was some sort of a message in Hieroglyphics. He even thought these could be some commandments for his disciples or his will. Tell me something Raja, though this language is extinct there are so many historians. No one can read it? They can. In fact Al Mamun did go to many of them but no one could help. Actually this language can be interpreted and written in many ways, much like a riddle. So you told him the meaning? No. Though there was an offer of 20 lakhs. Huh! Why?- - Two reasons. One, the writing is incomplete, there's more. Two, these aren't his teachings or his will. A request made 80 years ago because of a certain situation. A request? To whoever understands it. Let's say, to me.- - What are you saying! Can't make head or tail out of what you're saying. Hello. Yes, tell me. What! Really? Of course, sure. We're coming right away. Yes. Okay, bye. Hey Raja, what nonsense! - Hey! - What on earth are you doing! Mr. Mamun called.- - Are you mad! Mufti Mohammad has started sketching again. We can see him sketch if we leave right now. I'll change and come. Wait, we'll go together. But Kakababu, how can you go like this? What is the problem? Anyway the hospital will spare me in two days. But if I don't reach on time, will history spare me? So late! So late! You are very late! Sorry.- - Baba Peer stopped writing. I came back you know, from the nursing home, I rushed to his room but he had stopped sketching. He is just sitting there. I don't know what to do. This way. Please come. Whatever, I want to speak to him. He is trying to tell us something through the pictures. How will you speak to him? He hasn't spoken for years. He will. He sure will. I've brought his language along with me. What! What are you saying? Don't mind please. You both stay here. We both go in. But we...- - Alright. You guys wait here. Let's go in.- - Thank you. Come. Respected Master we have a guest from India who wants to meet you and talk to you. Hello. Hafiz! Hafiz! - Call the doctor right now! - Yes. Are you okay? Hello doctor, come fast. Baba's not well. Baba, how are you feeling? Baba! Do you feel alright? Take him. The doctor's on his way.- - Come. We must let him rest.- - What's wrong? Okay, don't worry. It's okay now. So, Mr. Roy Choudhury... could you understand what Baba Peer is trying to say? Yes.- - What is it? Sadly I can't tell you. Baba Peer's wish is that before the world gets to know about this secret I investigate this matter myself. All I can tell you is, this is probably Baba Peer's last will. But he neither mentioned money nor anything for his disciples. So I am so sorry, I really can't accept your kind offer. Baba Pir gave you the responsibility? Yes. And you won't tell me what the responsibility is? You'll investigate it yourself, sitting in Kolkata? No. I'll investigate in Egypt. What! You'll go to Egypt? If this is Baba Peer's wish, then What can I say? You took the trouble of coming here, you helped me, thanks a lot. If you need any help in Egypt, then give me a call. I'm going to Egypt next month. Maybe we will meet. Goodbye. Goodbye. Come. Quite a few of these shops are new. They weren't there earlier. But Bhombol's Salon is still there. Do you get Chinese here?- - Yes, anything you want. The Lamb dry and Fu-young are very famous here. Naren, have some.- - I've tried it. Quite tasty. The sweetmeat is pretty good.- - Have some, Shantu? Everything is the same, isn't it? Sorry. I've to go back now. I have a seminar tomorrow. Okay, see you. Sure. I'll show them around the JNU campus. I think going to Egypt is a very stupid thing to do. Amazing place. The university is located right in the middle of Aravalli mountains. Within jungles, caves and ravines stands this academic complex and this hostel. Raja, I'm serious. At least we can discuss this? Sure. But you can't discuss it anywhere and everywhere. It's a very dramatic discussion. We need a proper stage. Shantu, your uncle is nuts. Stage, as in?- - A stage amidst the wilderness! The place is very romantic, isn't it?- - Yes, I was thinking... Shantu, the Egyptian Mystery is clouding our other mystery. In fact, the other one is a little complicated. What other mystery? Not mystery. Mystery woman. Gentlemen... presenting... P.S.R. P.S.R? Partha Sarathi Rocks. See those rocks?- - Huh? Over there. Delhi's highest natural point. Named after the first VC of JNU. And finally, gentlemen... this is O.A.T. And as the bard wrote, "All the world's a stage And all the men and women merely players". Okay, let's talk now? Yes. Sure. Tell me. Raja, I have had a word with the embassy. With the Interpol too. Not only as a friend, I'm warning you as a senior officer of the CBI, going to Egypt is a very bad idea. For a start, the political condition in Egypt isn't very good right now. Moreover, you and Al Mamun, both have been attacked twice already in your own country. If something happens abroad, who will be responsible? This affair has become more delicate after Mufti Mohammad's death. Two groups amongst his disciples. One led by Al Mamun. The other group's leader is Hani Alkadi. We have information, Hani Alkadi made those attacks on you. Nice. Such a sweet name. Hani Alkadi. So this Hani Alkadi is harmful you say? Not sweet like his name?- - Don't joke Raja. Hani Alkadi is a very cruel and cunning man. Studied in Europe. Very knowledgeable. Knows 17 languages. Trained in hand to hand combat and long distance shooting. Master of disguise. He is the biggest reason behind this growing underground movement in Egypt. Hani Alkadi thinks Al Mamun had hired you to decipher the meaning of Mufti Mohammad's will. Now that you've figured it out, you're double crossing and going to Egypt to get it yourself. So, before anything happens he will fetch the meaning of those pictures from you. Wow. Quite nice. Then we can play Pictionary together. Hey Raja, Indian Government can't take this risk. I spoke to them. I'm not going on government's behalf. I'm going on my own. What nonsense!- - Thanks for the visa though. Please tell him!- - What will Shantu say? First let him read out the message from Hani Alkadi. Let's see what my sweet villain has to say. Message? What message? I did not get any...- Check your brain first and then your pocket. Found it? Yes. A chit. But how did it...- Remember bumping into someone at KC? - That building there? - Yes. Sorry. See what he writes. Read it. "One who breaks the King's slumber death, as fast as the wind shall befall him." The mummy's curse engraved on the tomb of Tutankhamun. You know Shantu, those who discovered Tutankhamun's tomb many of them died a mysterious death. So Is this a warning? Well, not a mock test suggestion paper certainly. But not a warning. A challenge. Fine. Let's see who death befalls when the King's slumber breaks. Egypt... here we come!- - Yes! No, but I was saying...- - Don't look directly, try to see from the corner of your eye. That man in KC, remember the colour he was wearing? Who? Where? Alkadi's man. On the top of P.S.R. Shadowing us. Checking if we take up the challenge or not. (song playing) Oh no! This must've been Naren. He must've informed the embassy. - Did you know Sidhharth is posted here? - Yes... no, I mean... - Didn't know he'd come to receive us. - Oh, got it. Welcome! Welcome to Egypt. Met you after so long. - How are you all? - All good. We last met during the Kanishka episode. Come let's go home. Jumbo Prawns in coconut milk, Steamed Bhetki, Chutni, all that you love...- - How thoughtful of you but we've a booking. We'll go to the hotel. Though, Shantu may want to...- - No! Why? No... Fine! Have dinner with us. I'll pick you up in the evening. Which hotel?- - Harmoheb. I'll pick you up from Harmoheb. Err... in that case I don't mind falling for the trap Snigdha has set with those Jumbo prawns! So Shantu, this is the country of the pyramid of Khufu, once world's tallest building. This is the country of Sphinx, half man half lion! This is the country seeing who's Queen, Julius Caeser said, Let me help you.- - Oh don't bother, continue with your Cleopatra instead of all this. How are you? (song playing) Won't you take a bath? Believe in ghosts? Ghosts! Spirits. Err... may be I do, haven't decided yet, why do you ask? Quite a few years ago I had come to Egypt on a government assignment. In fact that was when I began studying about Hieroglyphics. Had heard an interesting story back then. Crossed my mind on our way from the airport. Hey! I am postponing the bath. What story? King Khufu, after whom the pyramid is named, his mother, Queen Hetepheres' tomb was discovered by a man named George Resner. He found many valuable things there like golden beds, jewelry, etc. The usual stuff. But what he did not find was, So... Mr. Histroy Channel Addict, what is that ornate box called in which the mummy is kept? Err... Oh God! I know it, I nearly have it... Will the knowledge help if you nearly have it? Sacrophagus! Yes! Close, sarcophagus.- - Yes. Anyway, Resner discovered that the sarcophagus of Hetepheres was empty. No mummy! Why would a thief steal a corpse instead of the jewellery? Correct. But the horror story begins here, so far it was a detective story. After 3 months some archeologists went to the same place and found that the Queen's mummy was right where it should be. Strange!- - The story is not over yet. After that a tourist guide went there with some tourists and found the sarcophagus to be empty! Naturally, they were all...- - Hubba! What?- - Huh.. No. Nothing. Just like that. Your weird language to add to Hieroglyphics! Anyway, this continued for long. And according to folklore, the mummified Queen Hetepheres goes out for walks even today. So going out at night in search of adventure, will still be out of syllabus. My story is over. Now go take a bath or no mystery woman will come close to you. 'Hubba'. Mad! This is mad! You're mad! This is insane! This Hani Alkadi is trying to pressurise the Indian Government. Just to get hold of you and you come from India all the way dancing yourself! Manto, as far as dancing is concerned I don't even have two left feet, I've only one. And as for Hani Alkadi, don't worry, I'll manage. No, I'll...- - Anyway. We've met after so long, let's chat up a bit. Okay now tell me one thing, Queen Hetepheres' belongings, as in the bed, ornaments etc. They're at the Cairo museum right? I was talking to my nephew, Shantu, I really wanted to take him to the museum and and here he is, meet my nephew cum assistant, Shantu. And he's the curator of Cairo museum, Sadat Manto. My old friend.- - Nice to meet you. Hi sir. He just told me some interesting stories about Mufti Mohammad. Did not know how to read or write. Began as a tourist guide. Then he became a revolutionary leader against King Farouk. And after that turned into a spiritual seeker towards the end. Leaving out the tourist guide bit, the rest is exactly our Rishi Arabinda. So, as I was saying Mr. Manto, Mufti Mohammad made no mention of money, as you said. He was a self-proclaimed fakir. But he had one last wish or will if you so call it. He wanted me to verify something because of which I'm here. But there has to be lot of money. Mufti Mohammad, when he was a rebel leader, he had lots of arms, ammunitions, lots of money that funded the revolution. Now if he has a will, - I guess the lunch has arrived. - Yes. So, Manto. Will you have lunch with us?- - Yes, sure, why not! Fine, why not.- - So... what I mean to say... Professor. You come. We go. Now! Shantu, how can such a learned villain have such an uneducated side-kick? What you say?- - Nothing. I say, I not professor, you come at complete wrong place. No! No wrong. Right! I see your photograph. Now you come, we go. Oh no! Told you I not go. Because I not take orders. Tell Alkadi to come direct to here, we do face to face meeting. What say Shantu? Teach him some Bengali too, should I? Get going, you son of a lame woman! (song playing) BAM! WHAM! POW! If you want to kill me be my guest. But never talk to me like that. I hate bad manners. My God! I not kill you. He want you alive. But I kill boy. I kill man if you not come. Oh God! Why drag me into this? I am... innocent.- - Okay. I go. But Hani Alkadi should come. I guest. Not he. Don't worry. Just ask Sidhharth to inform the Indian embassy. And listen, stay in the room. Don't go seeking adventure to impress your Cleopatra. How does Cleopatra come into all this? The way your face lit up at the mention of Egypt, why me, anyone would understand. Let's see if your mother is okay with this. So Mr. Vidyasagar, let's go. Uno momento? (song playing) You wait here. He go to town. He come back soon. Don't try to run. Desert all around. Your crutch no help.- - I know son. Can't manage a run of crutch in the desert. I wait with pleasure. You go happily. Good evening! So? Still not dressed? Those jumbo prawns are weeping there for you. Is Kakababu ready?- - Kidnapped. Come. He come. He want to meet you. At last. Yes, even I'm getting late. Let's go buddy. Let's go. Hello Professor! Welcome to Egypt! Dr. Alkadi I presume? True, this is Africa but I'm not Livingstone. And definitely not a doctor. Nice to know that my mother tongue is one of the 17 languages you know. But let me also tell you, I am not a professor either. I know. But so many Indians teach here at the university, that we call all dignified looking Indians, professor. And with your kind of knowledge, I don't think the name is a misfit. Thank you. Have you kidnapped me and brought me here to honour me? Why such kind words? People use kind words in obituaries and funerals too. Isn't it Mr. Roy Choudhury? Anyway. Tea? I have some nice Darjeeling tea. No thanks. Sipping tea at one's own funeral isn't very civil. Now if you'd kindly tell me why I was brought here, because this kidnapping wasn't there in the tourism package. Kidnapping? For God's sake Mr. Roy Choudhury. What are you saying! You've come here on invitation. On the contrary I heard you've broken two of my men's wrists. Do you have the tradition of inviting at gunpoint here? Interesting. And how do you propose your love? Punching in the stomach? Or do you give gift-wrapped dynamites to kids on birthdays? You're indeed a brave man. Joking in this situation too? Okay fine, I'm sorry. My men got a bit tense and overdid it. Now can we please forget that and have a quick word over a cup of Darjeeling tea? Please? The moment you get a chance, you start shopping! Very irritating! Hmm, I know. There's still time before they come. Come on!- - Oh! What 'Oh'?- - Mowgli is on the way. That's why so much of hurry.- - Sis, please just stop this Mowgli thing. Better still, call him Asterix. I swear! Come on!- - Idiot, Mowgli has this wild thing about him, Asterix is an old man. Done? Come.- - Hello. What! What are you saying? When did this happen? I can't understand anything! What! Isn't the police doing anything? But he never told us... Told him! Warned him a hundred times! Such a stubborn man! We must speak to the government and the police! And of course government official! He is an Indian citizen. Coming right now. Bring him home. What'll he do sitting there alone? We better... Make other arrangements. Who is the ambassador there now? Hasn't their government put a reward on Hani Alkadi? But they still couldn't capture him? He is roaming around openly kidnapping people? But we, as his family... Don't need to go. I'll get back home and speak to you. Bye. Bye for now. Taxi! Taxi! If they don't go let me know. I too need to get prepared, right? I'm escalating the matter right away. Just give me half an hour. Okay? I must confess Mr. Roy Choudhury. Among the people I've seen all over the world I like Indians the most. I am huge fan of your Rabindranath Tagore's. In fact I've read him in original. I know, noticed a copy of "Gitanjali" in your room. What was that... "Wish I was an Arad Bedouin With the undulating desert beneath my feet". As a matter of fact at the risk of sounding immodest, people know me better as a revolutionary but I am a twice-published poet as well. Though under a pseudonym. Wow! Man of many talents! Brilliant! A Tagore's fan carrying guns, is a novel experience for me. You're finished if Vishwabharati University finds out. There you go. Actually I drink two cups of tea in the morning. Then I prefer black coffee the rest of the day. Don't waste time on the tea. I agreed to a 'quick word'. Not to 'Darjeeling tea'. And why?- - Principle. You tried bump me off in Delhi for no fault of mine. I'm not ready to have tea with a cold-blooded murderer sititng at the same table. Hossem! Hossem! Take out your gun! And show him what you're capable of. Look behind you bloody fool! Bravo, Hossem! Hossem is my bodyguard. Cool headed. Immaculate aim. Worked at a circus earlier. Then he was a hitman for some time. Shooting you from that distance was a cakewalk for him. But we didn't want to kill you. Didn't know you back then. Just wanted to scare you. I think you're insane. Stood at gunpoint with an orange in your hand to prove this? We are at some gunpoint or the other 24 hours my friend. We bathe, sleep, fight and dream; all at gunpoint. And we're all insane in our own way, right? Or why would someone scale Mt. Everest with a crutch? Or even accept Hani Alkadi's challenge? Believe me, just wanted to scare you! I just wanted to scare you, okay? I'm sorry. Just wanted to injure you. Right? I'm sorry. Now some tea please? Insisting on tea so much, anyone would think it's poisoned. Okay. Tea, chit chat, circus. Now, Baba Peer's will? No! Not happening! You're coming with us. Sidhharth, call the reception and tell them we're checking out. Though we should sue them. He was picked up in broad daylight! But we don't have time for all this. You're not getting it. Kakababu has asked me not to leave. - What if he wants to send a message? One of us will come and check at the hotel. And I don't think Kakababu would've approved of you staying here alone all night. Exactly! I've spoken to the embassy. They're sending guards at our place. Let me suggest this, I couldn't cook at home today so, we order food and eat here, then pack Shantu's stuff and leave. Excellent idea. Okay Shantu? But you don't get it.- - Another 'but'? Listen, courage without intelligence tantamounts to stupidity. And don't you think if we stick together we'll be in a much better position to look for Kakababu? And what's your favorite? Hilsa caviar. Right? So want to try Batarakh here? Have a look. I thought Baba Peer was a fakir. Not a worldly man. Where does the question of a will arise? Before becoming Baba Peer he was a revolutionary leader. After General Nasser became the President and democracy returned to Egypt Baba Peer disbanded his group. With that the information of his group's fund and arms was lost. And I'm sure his will written in Hieroglyphics is the key to that. So give us those pictures, we'll leave you. Not with me, those are with Al Mamun. I saw them. But he didn't give them to me. Oh no! I heard you stole them and fled to Egypt. No. I don't know which gossip magazine you subscribe to but those are with Al Mamun. But neither you nor Al Mamun can decipher it. Fair enough. Then you tell me what he wrote before dying. I'm sorry. Baba Peer's strict orders were to not divulge anything before I investigate. Al Mamun offered me lakhs, didn't tell him, didn't tell my nephew Shantu, or my friend, Narendra. Then why will I tell you? Because of this Darjeeling tea? You mocking me? Me! Challenging me huh? Listen Roy Choudhury, you're from the land of Gandhi and Budhha. So let's do this non-violently. Or I'll be forced to slash your throat and put up that video on Youtube for your family. And my severed head with blab the meaning to you. Leading a revolution with this intelligence? You're crossing your limit!- - Shut up! Just shut up! You're shouting unnecessarily. Not just Gandhi or Budhha, another man hailed from our country. In fact he used to live in my neighborhood, in Bhawanipur. Subhash Chandra Bose, must've heard of him? Professor you... Listen Professor you come from the largest democracy in the world. Have any idea what 31 years of emergency rule looks like? Have you smelt it? Where the police can keep a man in the jail for months for no rhyme or reason! Torturing him! Where you don't have the right to protest, to have demonstrations. Where freedom is sold in the black market at a premium. Where, for corruption, ministers' income and unemployment increase at the same rate! No. You don't know and you never will. My country is bleeding, Professor. And as long as Jashne Mubarak is in power it'll continue to do so. We're planning a civil disobedience and an armed rebellion next year to topple the government. We've to fight his police, his army, his administration! And for that we'll need a lot of money and arms. Can you donate a bit of your democracy to us, Professor? "Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high Where knowledge is free, where the world has not been broken up fragments by narrow domestic walls". There's no indication of money or arms in Baba Pir's last sketches. It is a request to investigate a historical event. If, in that process I find any lead to money or arms, I promise you'll be the first person to know. But in return I need some help from you. To fulfill his last wishes I've to go to the bottom of a certain pyramid or or might have to go down the well of a certain tomb. For that I need a guide named Daago Abdullah who I had befriended here years ago. Along with him I need a jeep, tools and of course, my nephew. Can you arrange for all this? "Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit Where the mind is led forward by thee Into ever-widening thought and action Into that heaven of freedom, my Father let my Egypt awake". Shantu, I am doing fine. They're taking good care of me. Hani Alkadi isn't a bad guy. I quite like him. After this we'll go on an expedition from here. Here's what you have to do, listen carefully. The man carrying this letter will rent you a camel tomorrow morning. On that camel you'll reach Saqqara. There is the Step pyramid at Saqqara. The oldest of pyramids. It has steps going up, like stairs, you'll have no problem to find it. "Wait there. A man from here will come to get you. Do not inform police and be very careful on the way. P.S..." How is my to be daughter-in-law doing? Go on.- - Huh? P.S.?- - No, there is no P.S. What? It has to be there! It's a must! I'll read it out. It was a slip of tongue!- - No, let me read it. One second! The man who gave you the letter, what did he say? He asked me to reach Giza by car tomorrow morning. A camel will be ready there by ten. Fine. We reach Giza by ten. We'll leave together. Exactly.- - As in? You guys can't come. He'll be very angry. He asked me to go alone. Why will you all go? Alone? You didn't read out the entire letter. He asked not to get police. IPS not allowed. But IFS allowed. And IFS's wife and sister-in-law too. Yes of course, naturally. Don't do this! Wanted to see Hani Alkadi since childhood! Oh God! Why don't you get it? Is this a picnic? Can be dangerous! What if you get into a problem?- - Our coming along will help you. Okay! Okay! Think we'll miss the live telecast of a thriller and sit home? It's decided then. We'll go to Step pyramid on camel as normal tourists. Exactly.- - Alright? P.S.? Let's go then! How far, Sidhharth da? Never been to Step pyramid. Wait, let's ask this guy. So brother... oh sorry... Excuse me, I want to know how far is Saqqara. Very close, Master. Not too far. How close? How many miles? No miles, Master. Not too far.- - No miles? How many kilometers? Very close Master. Not too far.- - Not too far? Shantu, he is saying it's not too far. But I still doubt it. Looking all around I feel... Hey Shantu!- - Yes, tell me. Is someone following us? Where? Which side?- - Over there. See! Yes. Someone is! Huh! I think he is chasing us. Very fast. What are you saying!- - Sidhharth... what if they're the police or local dacoits! What do we do if they have guns? Guns? Who asked you to come? Warned you time and again. But you insisted! Now where's all the adventure gone? Could be police too. Hani Alkadi is on Egyptian police's most wanted list. Maybe they want to reach Hani Alkadi following us. Whoever that guy is, we've to reach Step pyramid before he catches up. Okay.- - Kakababu's emissary is waiting there. Yes, you're right.- - Tell him. Ask him to go fast!- - Yes, I'm telling him! Camel can run? Yes, Master. Salma can run, kneel down, lie down, jump. Okay. Good. Please make it run. Run! Run faster! Goons are after us brother! Make it run fast! What happened?- - Cannot go further. What! But why?- - Look. What is he saying!- - See... wherever we go...- - danger follows us. There's nothing we can do. We've to stop and get down. Or we'll die. Are you guys alright? Yes, I'm fine. Okay? Can't see that man anymore. Surely he has lost us. Let's go. We mustn't get late.- - Yes, right. Let's go. One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two. Good afternoon. Care for a guided tour? Why not!- - Okay then. Come. What do you think? The sky will clear up like this after the storm? For the sake of my country I hope so. Okay Professor, tell me something. I like the colour of the sky much more than the earth's. But why can't I see green in it ever? You know... blue, white, golden... silver, orange, yellow, red, even black. But never green! Oh my God! Listen. You'd better leave all this and concentrate on your third book of poetry. I know what you're thinking professor. What you're thinking is right. They belong to schools. But you know why they're here? To revise their text books at school. So that instead of studying the biography of Jashne Mubarak, they can study the real history of Egypt. Is that them?- - I think so. Are you sure they're the ones Kakababu sent? Wait. I can't make out from here, have to go and check. Hey wait. Don't go alone. Wait. - Is it them? - See properly. Yes, I think so. - Do you recognize them? - Yes. Yes, that's Al Mamun. Come on! Go with him and see!- - I'm going! Go with him.- - Wait. He knows him. - Thank God you're here! - Ask where Kakababu is. Kakababu was kidnapped by Hani Alkadi's men yesterday. And then we got a strange letter from him where Kakababu said he's going to send men at the Step pyramid to pick me up...- - Shantu! They weren't sent by him! Siddhart! Take this bloody insect away! Get him, right now! Run! Run! Let's go! They're hitting him! Don't let them go Shantu!- - Don't hit him! - Be quiet, Rini! - Shontu run! They're hitting him!- - I can see that. Rini! They're taking him away, do something! Bring the dog. Okay! You keep shut! Now listen, Daago Abdullah. Listen very carefully. Very precise at short distance. I really like it. I always keep it with me. From Germany. Very easy to carry. We found him hiding in Alexandria, Sir, after betraying two of our men to the police. Mercy, my lord, mercy! They offered lots of money, I couldn't resist myself my lord... Mercy, my lord, mercy! (speaking Egyptian) Mercy, my lord, mercy! Professor, could you kindly look away? Why? Believe me Professor, I really want to author my third book of poetry, You tell me, do I have a choice? If I let him go he'll weaken the movement again. Listen Alkadi, don't do this. I know justice must prevail. I know he erred... Nothing. Zilch. You know nothing! Know what the police will do to those two comrades of mine? They'll tear their nails off. Then hit them under the feet. They use iron rods to...- - Listen Alkadi... want to take a man's life, take it in a battlefield. Like a man. Killing an unarmed man won't add to the glory of your revolution. Mercy, my lord, mercy! Is this alright Professor? Please shoot me at your convenience, because if you miss, I hit. I don't like wars either, Professor. Or killing. But the situation my country is in, freedom comes at a price. And someone has to pay the price, right? But if your funds are depleted in order to pay off that... Self-defence, Professor. Is that okay with you? (all singing) (singing) I must say, Professor, you're looking like a pucca Egyptian. Don't laugh, this is disgusting! Now onwards, when you kidnap someone, don't forget to kidnap his suitcase too. Please. See that man, Professor? That old man over there. He's from our village. He taught me to play the Simsimaya in childhood. Simsimaya... sounds familiar. Is this a stringed instrument? Like a harp? Seriously Professor, is there anything you don't know? Feels strange you know, from those carefree days of my fishing village to these nights on the run in the desert. You know, had no worries back then. Played around all day, wouldn't go to the Madrasa. There was a girl. Freida. Eyes as deep as the river Nile. I'd go to meet her secretly. Secretly? Why? Coptic Christian. Our village was very regressive about such things. Where in India were you born?- - Kolkata. I was born there. Though in the Refugee Colony. My grandfather came over after the partition. I'm from a fishing village too, Bikrampur. After the partition, so... East Pakistan.- - No. East Bengal. Now Bangladesh. You guys need a lot of money, why not approach Al Mamun? He's quite a generous and helpful man. Are you insane? We'll take help from Al Mamun? That greedy, lowly, evil son of a pimp? More he earns, the more greedy he gets. So selfish, he took Baba Pir to Delhi for his treatment. Slow-poisoned him there. So Baba Pir would tell him everything before dying. We'll take his help? We? - Who never... - Master... Master... Master...- - Daago! What happened Daago? Who did this to you? Where is the boy?- - Master, I am sorry. Could not fight them. Too many they were. Waiting. They take the boy. Give the letter. Water! Some water please! Come here quickly! Come on! Get going! Where is Shantu? Alkadi, where is Shantu? What happened to Shantu? Where is Shantu? Kidnapped the boy right in front of us and we couldn't do anything! What could you've done? Fought their guns with sandals? And then you'd beat up Al Mamun with your hand-fan? Even the embassy has backed out. They say, nothing can be done until the Indian Govt. steps in. The situation is that delicate. Listen, can't we go check at Saqqara once? Just in case anyone's seen a guide... Wait, I'll get this.- - One second. Don't open! This could be dangerous. - You hit me! - Quiet! What are you doing?- - Let me see! Move, let me see. Good evening. My name is Narendra Verma. I work for the CBI. Wait, move. Let me see. I'm a close friend of your Kakababu. Please come in. Please be seated. You guys are weird! Kept shouting and screaming in the morning and you guys vanished with the camels! Hello... Shantu! Hello... listen to me, stop! Were you guys cooking?- - Err... no... Yes... no. No, not actually.- - Those won't be enough. Hani Alkadi and Al Mamun, aren't petty criminals. Anyway. Sit.- - Yes... err... Let me go over and cross check. What all has happened so far, however small or insignificant it may be, tell me. The Lowly, the Rotten, the Dirty I'll teach him a lesson! I'll tear out his liver and feed it to the falcons! No. No? Didn't you hear what he wrote? He's insulted me! Threatened me! I heard only one thing if you don't accept their condition within 12 hours, they will kill Shantu. Their condition? As in handing you over to them? Give up Baba Peer's bounty to that... to that bloody...- - Listen Alkadi, You both continue the tug of war with Baba Pir's imaginery treasure if you want to. Don't involve me or my nephew in this. Please. Write them a letter right now. If they bring Shantu at the temple near the Sphinx tomorrow, then they can be a part of the expedition like you guys. They will wait with you at the complex. I, Shantu and Daago will set out for the location. If I find any treasure or wealth there at all it will be split between you two. But if they don't bring Shantu, then I'll die but won't speak a word about the will. Sharing the booty! You're asking me to share that? Something that is for my country! Our homeland! How dare you! I'll die but...- - A lot of people can die, Alkadi. No one will gain from that. We've very little time. Don't behave like an emotional idiot. Listen Alkadi, all my life willingly or unwillingly I have given up a lot of things. In an expedition to Afghanistan, I lost my foot in an accident. And independence. So the whiny middle- class Bengali offers me the seat reserved for the Handicapped on buses. I've lived alone all my life, without marrying. Have denied my heart so I can lead my life on my own terms. But Shantu is a part of me, my most beloved part. My blood who I have mentored with much care, exactly the way I wanted. I will not and cannot give up on him. Under no circumstances. That day you pleaded for a bit of democracy and I beg of you for a bit of my life. Please. Paper. Al Mamun runs a group behind the cape of his business. A mole in that group leaked the news. Remember Alkadi, you people will wait at Giza. We've to go alone from there. But I can't understand where will Kakababu and Shantu go? No one knows that. Neither Al Mamun nor Alkadi. Because if you follow me then Al Mamun will follow you too. It will turn into a nasty situation, we'll all be at a loss then. Don't worry, I won't follow. But they'll both wait at Giza hiding within the crowd of tourists as per Kakababu's order. And we'll shadow them as per your orders and with us we will have the Egyptian police. Heard that police is coming to Giza to capture Hani Alkadi. If I get caught, police will torture in the lock-up, trial for treason and A public hanging. So couldn't we just go about without involving them? Too late. Police? Who informed the police? Heard he is your friend. CBI officer sent by Indian Govt. Always follows me! Are you sure you guys want to go? Huh? It could be dangerous.- - Let me speak! I mean, yes of course. Sis? Yes, of course! Mr. Verma I mean if Kakababu can plunge into an operation like this with his crutch if a young boy like Shantu can get involved in it then... then why can't my basket ball champ wife and her ferocious sister? Thrilling emotions, the movie's a hit! You're just too much!- - Just shut up! How can you joke in such a critical situation? (indistinct quarreling) Okay. I'm sorry Alkadi, don't go to Giza today, your life is too precious. I promise to inform you if I find anything. I know. But Al Mamun won't let that happen because he will be there. So I'll have to go. Don't worry. You go ahead. I'll come with a bit of make-up. Make-up? Last act of the play. Will need some make-up, right? Then let's get going? The game begins in two hours. Comrade! Long live the revolution! Master, sure they will come? Hey, we wait here. You not come; Indian girl, Indian man, Indian woman, all dead! Understand? Morse code would've worked better. Are you alright?- - Yes, I'm okay. My head hurts a bit.- - Happens. Come on Abdullah, let's go. I know he is here. But... Stop clicking 25 pictures per second like Japanese tourists. You only asked me to mingle with the crowd. Now you're overdoing it!- - Was necessary. They'll understand.- - No one can understand. But where's Hani Alkadi?- - Quiet! Softly! No idea. But the police has arrived. There, that small pyramid? That's our aim. We've to go below that. That, Master? But no go over there! Nothing there! Daago, let's not waste time. Keep going. Yes, Master. Sir!- - What? What happened?- - I want to see Sphinx. Sphinx, go that way.- - I'm walking, no Sphinx. Go that way.- - No! Here is pyramid but I want to see Sphinx. Okay, walk that way.- - No, I'm walking and walking. No seeing Sphinx. I want to see Sphinx. I'm very busy. I'm looking for someone right now. Where is your tour guide?- - No guide. You guide? I will get someone to help you. You stand here. Get me someone. Hey! I love Sphinx! Careful. Don't raise your head. Slowly. Yes. Do you remember that labyrinth, Daago? Came so many years back. I have forgotten. You go to there?- - Yes. But... only me and him. Not you. What! What is he saying! Master... Alkadi murder me!- - Don't worry. I've promised Baba Peer, I'll have to be the first person to know. Don't worry Daago. Wait here. We will both come back. Don't worry friend. Just wait.- - Yes. Come! Master... Don't leave me, Master... Not to worry. Wait, my friend. Wait. Master... Al Qadi will kill me, Master, if I let you go alone! Decided yet? What? Didn't you tell me at the hotel, that you haven't decided if you believe in ghosts or not. Come. Careful! I was asking... are we going to Queen Hetakoris'...- Not Hetakoris. Hetepheres. We'll have to come out crawling out of here. Remember I told you... that the Queen often goes out on walks at night even today. Only if she let's us walk back- - Decided. What?- - I believe in ghosts. Good. I got confused. Let's go that way. According to the calculations this should be a dead end. Go check once.- - Yes. Yes Kakababu, dead end. Then let's fulfill Mufti Mohammad's last wish. Now that we're here with that old man's challenge let's get to finishing it fast! Let's push it.- - Okay. Good. Knew it. Now... Phase two. Now, I will have to disclose Mufti Mohammad's last wish to you because without your help that wish cannot be fulfilled. I have been able to guess some of it. Let's hear. Queen Hetepheres' mummy is hidden somewhere here. Along with it there is a treasure and weapons which is what Al Mamun and Alkadi are after. You'll get half the point. Because jewellery, treasure, etc. Mufti Mohammad never spoke of all this. He says, Mufti Mohammad and a guide named Al bukhari discovered the tunnel under this pyramid and this chamber. But the credit went to the Europeans. So they took the mummy from here and hid it somewhere else to teach the Sahib a lesson. Later, they'd often hide it away and bring it back to the sarcophagus as a prank. From this, a myth of the ghost was born. Before dying, Mufti Mohammad wanted everyone to know that the mummy is hidden somewhere in this chamber. But before that he wanted me to check it. Because if someone's found it in all these years and shifted it then Mufti Mohammad will be proved a liar. This is someone's last wish? Was he a little bit of a nutcase? Leave that. We're standing under a pyramid with our lives at stake, fulfilling that last wish thousands of miles away from home. Let's not talk about insanity now. Now do one thing. See that wall? Step on its crevices and climb the wall. Listen, here, take this rope. Won't need it. The columns of pictures near your head, those panels... press the fourth picture of the second panel. Press it hard. Second panel. Fourth picture. Harder. A bit harder. Nothing is happening. Okay come forward. Now put your foot there. Put your foot on the wall. Now do the same thing. Press the second panel's fourth picture. Second panel. Fourth picture.- - Do it. Harder. A little harder. Press it a little harder. Go up. Go see what's in there.- - Yes. Be careful, Shantu. Take out your torch. Yes. See anything? Wait, let me check. Check properly. Check the right side. Found anything? A normal coffin, Kakababu. Oh really? Check if there's an abnormal mummy in that normal coffin. Sorry. Found it? Yes. Could you open it?- - Wait a minute. Manto! Manto! Why did I have to tell him about Hetepheres' tomb! How much did you buy him for? And why take the trouble, you were getting half the booty. You Bengali dog... your job was to lead me here. That's it. That's done. So I'm going to finish you and your little puppy dog. Right here. Right now! Kakababu I'm coming down! Don't, Mr. Mamun is angry!- - Careful! Stay there. Kakababu, careful! Move! Bengalis are not only dogs, Mr.Mamun, they can be ringmasters too. Kakababu, be careful! First lever principle, sir. Thousands of years ago probably this is how heavy rocks were lifted in your country. The Humerus bone of your forearm isn't that heavy though, that's quite evident from your lack of humour. Are you alright? Yes, cut my hand that's it. Now go. Get the mummy's clothes. Let's complete Mr. Mamun's fancy dress party! Come on now! You look quite cute! Now go get started at your job. I know it's difficult to concentrate with such distractions. Come on now, go. Anything in there?- - Yes. Wait. The mummy's in here Kakababu. But no treasure. No weapons. Knew there won't be any. Baba Peer would've told me if there was any. Nothing there... wait! A sandal. A sandal? Check if there are any Hieroglyphics on the wall or the ceiling, or on that coffin? No. Nothing like that. Okay, open the coffin and see. Yes, Kakababu! There are some pictures on the inner side of the lid. Good. Click those pictures with your mobile. Get down after that, we'll leave. Mr. Mamun, stay here for a few days. Outside, I'll put a board reading 'under renovation'. Till then stay here as the Queen's guard. You'll understand the worth of every moment here. You'll get to know how choking in hunger and thirst every moment can make a living mummy out of anyone. Now that's a death worth dying, Mr. Mamun. Of pomp and grandeur. Isn't it? How many clicks, Snighda! - Sis! What happened? You're fine?- - Yes, I'm okay. Shantu! Where's Raja?- - Coming. He's fine!- - Okay, come on now. You okay?- - Yes. Now hurry! Hey! Where's Alkadi?- - I don't know. This kid said the lame man is on his way. Get him right now! He is with the lame man. Right, sir. Come on. Quick. Run! Wow! The Pharaoh has come looking for the Queen's belongings. Poetic justice. Found anything? No Alkadi, I'm sorry to dissappoint you. The secret Mufti Mohammad had asked me to keep was Queen Hetepheres' mummy. But... we did not find money or weapons there. Nothing? No. But it's true that I...- - Run! Police! Thank you, Professor. You came this far to honour your promise to Baba Peer. Take care, Alkadi. I'm going back day after by Egypt Air. (song playing) Comrade! Long live the revolution! (song playing) Heard the man went mad? Yes, he was in a state of shock when the police found him. He thought Raja had really left him to rot there. Anyway, thanks for everything, when do we meet again? Trying to work out a transfer to Bangladesh next year. That'll be easier. Good if Rini can do her college from Kolkata or Delhi. Though she wants to stay here. Right? Yes, right.- - Will you remember? The Pharaoh Asemhet the third's tomb. Third chamber. Press the fifth picture on the right hand side wall. Don't know what you'll find but that's what the pictures on the Queen's sarcophagus indicate. I knew it, Professor, all the way. Baba Peer can't send you so far only to check a mummy. Thank you so much.- - Well, If you really want to thank me, can you promise me something? Sure, anything. Speaking from the experience of 63 years of democracy in our nation remain Hani Alkadi after democracy returns to your nation. Don't turn into another Jashne Mubarak. Where's Raja?- - Yes, where is he? There he is. He's speaking to a woman... Come on, we're getting late. What? Let's go! Shantu, let's go, what's happening? Oh. Such things happen. What is so... What's there to be so... 'Hubba' in this? Hubba?- - Hubba. Hubba! Yes, right, Hubba! Come on, we're getting late. You guys get Hubba so easily! - I'll take that. - Come on let's go. Hubba is actually an Egyptian word. Sometimes they say, Al Hubba too.
