It's a game, not a fairy tale Did not see that coming Right, business before pleasure Chen Chen Next spot is the Rose Garden, 5 kms away Su Yi Mr. Song Why are you still cooking? Mr. Su's gone already What? Well I cannot find my task card, hold on It's on the floor Take it You can choose not to go but that means you'll lose at this task A key task Why didn't you inform me earlier? Take me there No What now? This outfit sucks Take a seat I remember that every time I got upset I'd go to the swing on the campus And you'd always be there with me Is that all you can remember? Of course not I also remember that time I was sick you stayed with me in the hospital for a whole night and you skipped the exam Luckily Yue Yue got me covered That night you held my hand and said to me you wished you could bear all the pain for me I was moved But not flipped When you left me Yue Yue said I should give up But I coudn't I'm grateful that you gave me so much happy memories Why did you have to leave? You couldn't imagine how I struggled through Every minute when you were gone was a torture Can we start over? Su Yi, don't forget We are in a game I don't care Even if it's a game I want to be with you We'll stay in the game and never quit What if I say no? What can I do to make you say yes? Have you noticed one thing? Can you not change the subject? You always bring him up while talking to me Who? Song Chengyue Just promise me one thing and I'll say yes What is it? Never ever see Song chengyue again Mr. Song, don't you want to know what they are talking about? why do I have to leave Yue Yue? How can I hear anything from this far? It’s a bit far I grew up with Yue Yue All those years I can't do it I get nothing There's no sound Hold on, I'm on it. There you go Can it be something else No If you can't do this simplest thing how can you say you love me? Or is it because you fell for him while I was gone these years? That's not true All I want is you How could I have fallen for anyone else? Then prove it to me Leave Song Chengyue Why didn't you give me the earphone earlier? Why didn't you give me the earphone earlier? Maybe you couldn't get over it because I was the one leaving That's why you can't let go of me Bai Yu, that's enough Yue Yue, why are you here? Mr. Song Love is purely a bargaining chip to you, isn't it? You want me to remind you of the deal we had? What deal? Su Yi Our relationship is like a fishing net and you are the fish in the net You cannot escape If you really care about me prove it to me Yue Yue What's going on between you two? What is the deal? Su Yi If you can never find him what do you do? I'll never give up Yue Yue You'll help me right? If he actually cares for you he wouldn't have left without a word Give up I know I've always known that you have deep feelings for Bai Yu But it's unrequited love I couldn't just watch you suffering so I went to him and persuaded him Care to make a deal with me? to date you What deal? Su Yi got feelings for you Do you know? Why do you think I'd take the deal? Your mother's sick She needs money So you're saying Bai Yu didn't actually love me He disappeared to get rid of me No Why did he suddenly come back? Deal… You forced him to leave, right? I have no idea why he left you All I know is I'm upset You're upset? No you're not That's not true You're with me every day yet thinking about someone else Do you know how awful I feel? Yue Yue, but we are… What, best friends? Don't go Chen Chen, How's it going between your brother and Su Yi? He finally confessed to Su Yi Su Yi didn't say anything He just left And then my brother also left And he wouldn't let me go with him Do you think... Bai Yu Bai Yu Bai Yu? Chen Chen, did you program the plot of kidnapping Bai Yu? Kidnapping? Where did you keep him? Do I need to assign the next task to Su Yi? Of course not Who kidnapped him? It's too dark to see Check it for me Now One more thing Can you stop eating my chips? Big deal I don't like chips at all Song Chengyue If you want to prevent Su Yi from finding me you don't have to do this Don't forget It's just a game But it's too real Even If it's a game you'll remember everything that happens here Tell me, why are you in this game? What do you want? So you overheard the conversation while I was on the phone Who's my assistant? You're a smart guy From the start I thought he's no more than an NPC but the first player the game developer invited was Su Yi If the NPC's role is to guide a player the one he is following should be Su Yi Besides, each time he gave directions I always ran into something I hate to see To stop Su Yi from leaving you you'd go this far? Then why did you offer that deal? He didn't know what he really wanted He had no idea he could survive without you Is that so? Just think about it While we were in high school when you were not sure about your feelings towards Su Yi he said he liked me Then you came and offered me that deal But when things went so well between Su Yi and me you started to realize that you felt jealous That's enough I'm not done yet You hate to admit it When you came to me you started this mistake Love is not as simple as that You could've thought better Hello Hello, I'm the assistant of Mr. Song I just got the news Bai Yu got kidnapped What? Where are you? I'll send you the address, alright Are you sure you got feelings for Su Yi? Yes A guy like him, no one can possibly say no to Let alone it's me who lives with depression He's like warm sunshine in winter He cured me Sunshine It only belongs to me But he cares about me I'll prove it to you This time, I won't take any deal We won't be manipulated by you any more Shut up You're such a coward You've loved Su Yi for all these years but you don't have the guts to tell him If it's not for me pushing him he would never know the man who he trusts the most loves him secretly Bai Yu You don't love him as much as you think But he loves me Tell me Tell me What makes you quit? I'll give you as much money as you want How much do you want? Money won’t work this time Song Chengyue Stop it! Su Yi Watch out! Yue Yue Yue Yue If it weren't for him I'd be with you forever And he threatened me just now He said if I didn't leave you he'd kill me Su Yi, Song Chengyue is crazy Yue Yue Are you alright? Yue Yue Someone got stabbed Sorry I didn't want this to happen But I just want to be with you so much Yue Yue I know I know, I know now If you can survive this I'll be with you Su Yi I'm so happy Yue Yue Yue Yue Yue Yue Why is your phone off? Do you know how worried I was? Yue Yue, don't be mad I was too focused on the video game I promise I won't do it again You better not Yue Yue Su Yi, I don't want to die young from being mad at you First step is to push my brother to confess Second step is to make Su Yi realize he cares about my brother Even though there's some accident overall it went well Mission accomplished I need to go Bai Yu Thank you Oh by the way you did so much for Dong Dong and me We wouldn't be together without your help You're most welcome We really need to thank you Bye Because I believe all shall be well and every Jack shall have his Jill Let's go Now the front is next to the back Does that mean we can be together? I know you're into Xu Dong I also know that you are with Su Yi only because my brother forced you to Now, how about we make a deal too? Brother Chen I knew it's you You are damn ugly Shut up Sister But you do look like shit I'm kidding I'm kidding But I need you to answer this Did you purposely lead Su Yi and me into the game? Take a wild guess Hello Our company's developing a new game called Fanatic The world in the game is the same as the real one We'll only recruit five players around the world You are chosen to be one of the five players Are you interested in joining us? Where's Su Yi? Su Yi? He fell asleep outside You want to see him? It's fine Does it hurt? Song ChengChen, I'll kill you Come and get me Every morning I wake up to the wonderful breakfast you cook Yue Yue, you are the best You should remember that Smells great Have a taste How's it? You're the sweetest Why are you here alone? Got something on your mind? I don't understand Why did he leave Maybe it's destiny You'll always be with me right? I'm always with you Idiot Brother Time to tell you the truth Shoot Love is blindness Love is blindness That's true, blindness Otherwise we wouldn't have fooled someone smart like you “We”? Bai Yu and I Bai Yu and You? I saw Bai Yu off Then we became BFF BFF? It's more than that I helped him to get Xu Dong They've been dating for three years It's been three years What's up Chen Chen? Yu Can you do me a favor? What's it? Just shoot Su Yi and my brother are going to return from the US But you know my brother's too shy to confess his love I can't wait any more You, you've got brother complex He's my big brother That makes sense So are you in or not? Fine, I'm in What do you need me to do? Be quiet, your brother needs some rest Su Yi She's the big boss in this game So we're still in the game? But you're hurt You can feel the pain, right? The pain is real Our game is a holographic 3D simulation game Even though you may get hurt… He will survive, It's fine If Chen is the big boss of the game Bai Yu disappeared and entered the game directly… Wiseman He logged in via cellphone In this game my brother sorted out his true feelings and fought for what he wanted While in the real world, he may not have the courage Su Yi, think about it After three years do you still love Bai Yu? Or you can't let go just because you were left behind? Wake up Get up Morning Darling
