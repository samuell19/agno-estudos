Art Director Slobodan Terzic Directed by Ivan Stefanovic Auntie.. Mrs Petronijevic... I'm little surprised by your sudden visit. Radmilo... You have always been like a son to me. You know that. I know. I have always supported you in everything you had done. And you had done a lot. You are a successful lawyer, you have a nice house... You are successful in all aspects of your life. Thank you, auntie. All the things you'd done in your life, you'd done by yourself. Let's get to the point. -Yes please. - Thank you. It's true that you have everything. Everything but a wife. Yes... It's high time you got married. - Yes, it is. I must say I agree with you. I have an ideal wife for you. My daughter Dara. I nearly failed to finish my tests. I don't expect a good grade. And you? Tatjana... I'm talking to you. What's up? - I'm concerned about my marks. You are not concerned about your marks. But something else? Yes... Mrs Petronijevic... -Yes? Your daughter Dara is a very beautiful girl. -Yes, she is. You should see how good housewife she is. You know that one: "Like mother, like daughter". -Yes. But I must say that, despite all the respect for your whole family, I have chosen another girl to be my wife. Radmilo... Dear I didn't know that. Wait, wait... You won't find a girl who is better than my Dara. We have prepared you a good dowry; our pub and fifty thousand dinars. Thank you, but I don't care for dowries. And our house. When we die, of course. Stana, I have prepared for you a satin coat and two thousand dinars. Stana! You promised me! If Radmilo has already chosen a girl to marry, there's nothing we can do about it. Yes. But you were giving hope to my Dara! I apologize to both you and Dara if I was giving you a false hope, but I didn't promise anything. This is a big surprise for me. Radmilo dear,who is she? - Yes, who is she? You don't know her. She's from Belgrade. From Belgrade? God save us! Do as you please. You'll see who she is. She won't let you in her house, Stana. From Belgrade... Goodbye. -Goodbye. He has proposed to another girl. How come? -I don't know. Wait honey...Dara! What happened to her? What if they wanted to marry Dara with Mr Tomic? -I don't know. I think they did. All the girls in the town are in love with him. Anyway, he's not going to get married, so don't worry. I'm not worried. You missed to say the news to your aunt, a? -Auntie...- How could you...? I didn't want to tell you untill I was sure about that. Are you sure now? -I'm still waiting for her reply but I think... What is she like? Who is she? She's a cousin of my college friend.-Aha. You remember Dragisa? And then I met her. She was a little girl then. I came closer to her and, joking, kissed her hand as if she was a lady. She smiled at me looking me in the eyes. Auntie... I will remember that look for the rest of my life. Is she beautiful? - Like an angel. What is her name? -Ljiljana. Good morning, mum. - Good morning. Sit down, Ljiljana. We should talk about something. Your father and I had told you about Dragisa's friend, Radmilo Tomic. He sent another letter, a? Mum, I've already told you I'm not in love with him. Everybody who knows him says he is a nice young man. All right. I don't say he isn't. And he doesn't want anything. Absolutely nothing. -Nothing but me. A trifle! -Don't talk like that. Some girls will never know whether they get married because they are loved or because of their dowries. And you will never be in such a dilemma. You should be happy. There are no young men like him any more. And he is handsome. Nota single smart girl would say he has flaws. All right. It means I'm not smart. Listen, he's coming here with Dragisa tonight. -No! He's coming, it's been arranged. Wait until you meet him and then decide what to do. Nobody will force you to do anything. Just think it through well because you will never find a man like him. All others only want your dowry. Not all of them. -Trust me. You are pretty but they don't rush to propose to you. When they hear you have no dowry, they get away in a flash. What a wonderful surprise! What a good opportunity. We're all alone. As if you had known... Sit down please. - I'd rather not. Why are you looking at me like that? I'm not in a good mood. L'll cheer you up. Momcilo... I have come here to ask you something. Ok. You know you can ask me anything. I know but I feel a little uneasy. Why do feel uneasy? Did I ever say no to you? You told me that... You can see us together in future. -Yes. Well.. Will you marry me? Well, well... A girl wants to get married and is asking me to marry her. It's now in. Women ask men to marry them. I am serious. Is it an utimatum? I like you because unlike some other girls you never mention marriage. What other girls? - Women in general. All of them only think about getting married, while you... You had never been burden with that. What happened? I know. Your parents made you feel angry so you have come here, a? No. -No'? -Why are you so nervous? C'mon... l'll calm you down... Momcilol I'm asking you again. Will you marry me or not? I will.l will... Momcilo...-Yes... -Momcilol Wait, wait... How can you expect me to marry you ifl don't get to you closer. Show me how good you are. Let go of me! Let go of me! - Listen, Ljiljana... We are young, we should have fun, we still have time. Is it ok? -No? -No! I asked you what I wanted. You replied... So if... If you don't want to marry me, lwill marry another man. Really? -Yes. It's ok with me. If he's a better opportunity, go ahead and marry him. You don't care at all. You'll treat your friends because your girlfriend's getting married. You would be happy ifl got married. I wouldn't cry out of joy but I wouldn't weep either. Wait..wait... Why do you link love to a marriage? I love you anyway. Don't touch me! Goodbye Momcilo. Where did you go? To the cinema. What film did you watch? I watched... Did you have a good time? - It was sad. Let's go now. Dragisa is here. And Radmilo. Here they are. Sis! '-J'iljana.__ I guess you don't remember me. You were a schoolgirl when we met. I remember. You know Ljilja... Radmilo is going to be a Member of Parliament. Really? It doesn't mind... You should see him defending. Radmilo is my true friend. I would allow him to take care of the most precious thing I have. Listen... Maybe this evening we shouldn't... Why not? We'd better meet in a restaurant tomorrow and have lunch together. -It's not a bad... - No, let's do it now... I agree. I will marry you. I will marry you. He left yesterday and I still don't know where he is. I know. Where is he? In Belgrade. At a wedding party. -Really'? Whose wedding? His own. He finally got married. -You don't feel sorry? -No. Why should I? You are right. He's much older... And who's the lucky girl? I hope it's not Miss Dara. -No, no... It's a girl from Belgrade. She's very beautiful. My brother told me that. I have to go now. See you. This is our town. My office is up there. Our house is not far. I walk to my office every day. You'll see how nice it is. She's so good. Shut up, lka! Why? You don't think she's pretty? For God's sake, she's just got married. You're right. I'll be patient. She's gonna need me in a couple of years. It's nice, isn't it? - Yes, it is. You can plant here whatever you want. Welcome! Wellcome, Mrs Tomic. My name's Julija. -I'm Ljiljana. Nice to meet you. She's beautiful. You have been working here for a long time? Well... yes. For about two and a half years. I must say that I have never seen him being so happy. Let me show you the house. Go and see how beautiful is the interior of the house. I hope you will like it. - Of course she will like it. After all, it's her house now. - Not her house. It's her home. I don't know why people say that she's so beautiful. As if pretty girls come from Belgrade only. She's not real something. Sweetheart, you are the most beautiful for me. Liiljal I'm coming. It's ok. Take it easy. I'm waiting for you. Come here. How long have I been waiting for you! I couldn't wait for Julija to leave us alone. You know how much I love you? You know? My wife... What's the matter? Why are you looking at me like that? SorfY- Sorry for what? I just can't. It' ok. I know. You have a headache of the train. Let me kiss it away. Stay away from me! Why did I get married? I can't do this. It's ok. Everything will be all right. Just calm down. Take your hands off me! I don't love you. I guess it's normal. You don't know me very well. We don't have to do anything tonight. And tomorrow? Tomorrow neither. As much time as you need. You'll get to know me better. And I hope you will start loving me. Right? C'mon, don't look at me like that. You're tired of the trip and should rest. Come and sit. Don't be afraid. Come here. Everything's gonna be just fine. Take it easy. Why don't you leave me alone?! You are disgusting! I hate you! I can't be with you. Ijust can't. I'm in love with another man. I have loved him for two years... I loved him today in church while I was saying I loved you. And I love him now. Julija has prepared breakfast. Are you hungry? We are formal? What else can we do? She'll bring the breakfast in a minute. Did you sleep well? Yes, I did. You did? No, I didn't. Good morning. You are so beautiful, lady. Did you sleep well? Were you warm enough. -Yes. -Fine. Here's some fresh bread. Have you seen that there was a good crop of apricots this year? In the backyard. We gonna have jam, compote... whatever you wish... Plums, cherries, ribes... all kinds of fruit. When you see it, you will never want to go to any other places. Enjoy your breakfast. I feel sorry for you not being happy but it's not my fault. Is it my fault? -No, it's not, although... It might be your fault. You never asked whether I loved you. When a woman accepts the marriage, I think she must know herself that much to feel whether she can live with that man even if she doesn't love him. It's logical. You have just convinced me that women are not logical at all. I don't know you at all. For me, you are a stranger. You don't have to hate me. I don't have to be disgusting because of that. Ok. I might have said it in a rude way. I guess there's not a polite way of saying such things. I had thought this situation over. You were very clear about what you feel and I find it very cute. I mean that frankness of yours when you say how disgusting I am. In fact, I am grateful to you. You spared me from your lies and from mine as well. Although I coudn't suppose you were a kind of girl who would bring traces of her past to her marriage. I have no bad traces of my past. Last night you confessed that you loved and still love another man. I don't know how but you put him beetween the two of us. I broke up with him. - But you still love him. Is husband supposed to be a love doctor to his wife? To give her love advice? I thought you were different. I'd better pack my things today and leave. Where are you going? What are you doing? What do you think I'm doing? I don't want any longer to torture either you or me. Sit down. Please, sit down. Please. I want a divorce, too. We both agree about that. As a gentleman I'll take all the responsibility in this case. But under one condition. You will stay in this house for three months as my wife. As your wife? Don't worry, you will just pretend because of people. But why? -If you leave right away, there'll be gossips and ridicule. I'm ready for that. But, I'm not. You'll leave and I'll stay here having to put up with these people. Give me... Please, give me enough time, give me three months. I have to make up a good reason for our divorce. The one which will harm neither of us. Three months of this life? Why Radmilo? I won't ask anything from you. You can sleep here and I will sleep in my study. You can lock the door of your room if you want. Well? Do you agree? I owe you that much. I have one more question. How intimate were you with the man you love'? Since we gonna be divorced in three months time Ifind unnecessary making such questions. Let it remain my secret. Let it remain my secret. Oh, it's you Julija. I was just checking if there are some Radmilo's clothes for ironing. Give them to me, please. - But there aren't any. -Okay. I didn't know how pedantic Radmilo was. - He's a real dude. Yes. He is very pedantic. Well, you can call me if you need something. -I will. Come in! Oh, it's you Margita. -Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. I've come to return you your book. My book? -The book you lent me for my exam, don't you remember'? I can't remember. Anyway, you lent me the book and I'm giving it back to you. Thank you for your help. Would you like to sit and have a cup of coffee? No, thank you. Ijust wanted to return the book. l' m in a hurry. Bye. This is not my book. She has forgotten this. Go and take this... She's already away. Dear Radmilo Today I'm feeling so good... I'm writing to you and I still don't know whether I will send you this letter. I don't dare to think about it. Where were we? You know what I havejust heard. It's a tragedy. What do you mean Julija? That girl across the street, Tatjana, nearly hanged herself. Which girl Julija? That schoolgirl, a highschool graduate. - Why did she want to hang herself? I'll tell you why but don't say a word about it to Mr Tomic. What does he have to do with it? More than you can imagine. That girl is in love with him. You mean she wanted to... Was he in love with her? - No, she is too young for him. But she tried to commit a suicide... She wanted to marry him But for him she's just a child. If she wanted to marry him she must have had a good motive for it. From him? None. I'm not sure, you know men... They often flatter women but they don't want anything from them. Yes, but Radmilo has nothing to do with this. Tatjana! -I'm coming. Have you recovered? - Not fully. Here I am. You want an apple or a pear? -A pear. They are so delicious at this time of year. You like them, a? - Yes. You want the papers? The same situation again. You're reading the papers and I'm sitting alone. As if I was in some kind of prison. I thought you didn't like talking to me. I understand what you mean. It's ok. Can we at least try to make this situation less unpleasant? A? Imagine that we met in some resort. Would you talk to me? A young man always feels good talking to a girl. Until she disappoints him. Put down those papers, please. I am used to talking to somebody in the house. My father would always talk to me. You want me to play your dad? - Does it offend you? My father is a decent, educated man. - I do respect your father. But it seems he didn't know you well enough either. Well, maybe I don't know myself well enough. Maybe you don't know yourself well enough. Maybe. Tell me... Have you ever been a reason for someone's disappointment? I don't think I have. Nobody ever suffered because of you. Even if it happened, it wasn't tendencially provoked. Have some tea. I have to go back to work. I'll pick you up later and we can go for a walk. Okay? -Okay. Three quaters of our citizens still live from agriculture. It's three times more than in developed Germany or America. And the number of illiterates? Forty percent. If we want to change this, we have a lot of work to finish. If we take in consider that last year was without rain, our agriculture is in crisis. The price of grain in the whole kingdom has fallen almost by half. And how much time will it pass until the government finds out that the best way to help a farmer is to let him offer his products? On domestic market. And how will that happen? By increasing industrial citizens. Go fowvard and find a better place to stand. -It's ok. You can't hear. Politics should serve domestic economy. Economic moments should dominate the political ones. Bravo Radmilol Bravo! Congratulations for your speech. You were great. -Thank you.-So ardent... Yes, it was great listening to you. - Thank you again. Liiliana! Sorry I was busy talking to that lady. I didn't know you were coming. You are formal again. Okay. Well... You made a nice speech. Who told you about the meeting? - Mrs Nikolic's son. I see. I didn't tell you because I didn't think you were interested in it. I'm interested in everything that has to do with you. Even when I am angry? Even when you talk to young ladies holding their hands. You don't expect from me to stop saying hello to young ladies. Oh, no!l don't have the right to do that. Ifl am late for lunch, don't wait for me. OkaY- Look at that hat... If I finish my exams, I will go to the seaside. -Lucky you. Good afternoon, Mrs Tomic. - Good afternoon. Didn't I tell you about Radmilo? He's an ardent speaker. Yes, I am very pleased. - He understands farmers, I mean he understands their problems which is not so easy. And you... are interested in politics? Yes, very much. I'm not one of those who are satisfied by sitting at home. I like to know what's going on outside. - You are not like these local girls. And you? You are politically active? - A little. Mother, come here quickly. You must see this. Ika is walking her home. Didn't I tell you'? She will make him a cuckold. Her husband is working while she is walking with cavaliers. I bet he is declaring his love to her. What else can Ika do but declare his love to women? L'll catch them. They'll never forget me! You know the saying: be patient and you will be saved. I won't wait any longer. I won't. I'll show that tailor's son that I am better and more decent than his wife. She was having fun in Belgrade and then she came here. And Ika badmouths me around saying I'm stupid and I don't know to talk. I'll show him! Both him and that girl from Belgrade. They'll see that I'm not stupid. That I'm not stupid at all. I have laid the table and I'll leave you two alone. -Thank you. Enjoy the lunch. You have arrived. Let's have lunch, shall we? -Of course. Some soup'? -Yes. thanks. So? Are you satisfied with the meeting? Yes, I am. We have the majority of followers in town. You men are always happy. You don't stop playing even when you grow up. For me, politics is a serious matter. Of course, I didn't mean to say... You didn't tell me what you think about my peignoir. It's very beautiful. I haven't seen it before. I haven't dressed it before. Why are you wearing today? Today, it's been a month since we got married. That much has passed? I haven't noticed that. So, the honey moon is over. There are two months left. You are so handsome today. Mum has gone to the village and I am embroidering a cushion with irises for you. I have to finish it before mum comes back. Each petal has a letter of my name. Nobody will be able to read it. Except you. R,T,l MARGITA A, here you are. You want me to bring you the coffee here? -No, no... I just wanted to see this cushion because I like these irises very much... okaY- If you need anything, I'll be in the kitchen. Thank you. Good morning. -Good morning. I'm so glad to see you. Was it hard for you to wake up early? No, I don't like to sleep long. We'll stop to pick up our cousin. Ljiljana, you won't mind if she comes with us? Of course not. Why should I... -You'll see. She's a very nice girl. Radmilo knows her. She's studying law. She's Voja's cousin. Good afternoon. - Good afternoon. -This is our Margita. I'm so glad that you invited me. It's nice here. -There's a river down there. I'll show you later the spring of warm water. Vera! Come here. -I'm coming. My mother needs some help. I'll bring you judge Novakovic's case - All right. You'll be in your office tomorrow? -Yes, in the afternoon. See you.-See you. Good night. Goodbye.-Goodbye. What's the matter with you? -Nothing. You shouldn't care about that. Just leave me alone. Okay, just say what's it about. Wait, you're concerned that people might have doubts. Right? Don't worry. I'll be playing a happy wife. Just leave me alone now! '-J'iljana.__ Tell me what's wrong. You've been acting strange the whole day. You wanna know, a'? -Yes. Okay. Wait here. This is what's wrong. Margita's letters. Written to you. Where did you find them? -It doesn't matter. Okay. What are you blaming me for? -No, no... I'm not blamining you because she is writing to you or because she is in love with you. But you bring her to my company and let her sit by me. She is a lonely girl. I even recommended them to take her out so that she can meet some good man and get married. And they brought her to you! I didn't expect that they would bring her along. After all, she's their cousin, it's normal. Tell me frankly, would you be more pleased if not a single girl before you had wanted me? -No, I didn't say that. But you're giving her compliments and in that way you're giving her hope... You're raising dust for nothing. -For nothing? For nothing. She's a nice girl. She's a good girl... She's a good girl, she's better than me... What am I for you? A monster, an emptyheaded advanturist... You see nothing good in me. Don't cry, Ljilja. You will fag your beautiful eyes of so much crying. You don't care for my eyes at all. Why do you think so? You keep her cushion. When I got the cushion, I didn't know it was from her. I found about it later from her letter. If it bothers you we can throw it away. What else bothers you? Tell me. You have finally awaited that I am suffering for you. Listen... I don't want to live like this. This must be finished. Tomorrow I'm going back to my parents. You are a lawyer and I'm sure you'll find some solution. What ifl don't let you go, a? What we gonna do then? You can't keep me. I have hade enough of suffering because of you. Is that what you think? Then you can go. You couldn't wait for this! Liiliana! Open the door! -I won't. -Open the door or I will break it down. I won't! -Open! -No! You'll be sorry! -I've had enough of it. Radmilo... I've realised something. You love me inspite of everything. And... I love you too. Radmilo? You are trying to leave before I get up, a? Will you come back after I fall asleep, a? If you want, I can go to bed earlier. Ljiljana, we're not going to to discuss yesterday's matter. - What matter? Forget it. If you feel lonely, go to Vera's place. She'll be glad to see you. -Don't worry. I like to be alone. There's always something to do in the house. Mrs Tomic! Here's a man who wants to talk to you. He says it's important. He came from Belgrade. Tell him I'm not at home. Hello, Ljilja. You don't want to welcome your friend from Belgrade? I'll be back as soon as I find those acts. I must have left them at home. You go when you finish. Don't wait for me. - All right, Sir. You are early Mr Tomic. Mrs Tomic is inside. She has a visitor from Belgrade. From Belgrade? -Yes. A gentleman. You look good when you are nervous. You are so vain if you think I still love you. I am proud of myself for being strong enough to resist you. You are a little fervent animal. You're so cute. -Momcilo... I don't mind you're married. Not at all. And when are you going to come to Belgrade? I will not be jealous of your husband. You are now prettier than before. That ring on your finger gives you a taste of forbidden fruit. And for me forbidden fruit is the sweetest. Let go off me! Momcilo! Momcilol Scamp! You didn't have courage to marry her and now you want to destroy her marriage, a? Do you know who I am? -Get out of my house! A loafer! Before I kill you. -You married a galant man, Ljilja. Radmilo, don't! Don't do that, please. Let him go! I feel sorry for you because you married this villain. Please don't blame me for this. Leave me alone! You are to blame for this. You let that scamp get into my house and assault you in front of my eyes! It's disgrace! That is your big love,a? You have the right to be mad, but... -Just tell me... Did you know that he was coming? No, I didn't. -You didn't. You didn't... But you wished he would come. Who knows what could have happened if I hadn't appeared? Great fun! I apologized for spoiling your date. Why are you talking like that? You can throw me out of this house whenever you want. I'm here because you asked me to do it. Youjumped to help him and to save him when I started strangling him! I did it because of you, not because of me. -Please, don't... You don't deserve to become a murderer. He doesn't even mind that you're married now. You woud easily make up with him if you were somewhere in Belgrade. Your husband wouldn't know about it. You don't know me well enough. I couldn't recover from that love just like that. When you love even a bad person you need some time to get over it. You will never get over it. And just because of this mistake in my life you will think I'm a bad person. What are you doing here? I have a headache so I wanted to have some water. You have been upset by his visit today? Yes. You need a man, that's why you have a headache. What are you looking for? I understand that women who love their husbands try to find the infedelity proof. But what are you trying to find? I wanted to find the photo you were looking at last night. Oh, that's what you're looking for! You should know that I'm very careful. I always carry such things. Really? Yes. So you admit that you have that photo. Yes. But it's nothing, compared to your love dates. Please, don't... Why do you always reject my tenderness? Because I don't trust you anything anymore. Anything that comes from you, I assume as a lie. I think of you. We must see each oher as soon as possible. I think of you. We must see each oher as soon as possible. I can hardly bare your nearness without being able to touch you. Lj. T. Kitten! Kitten! Mrs Tomic! Good morning. I was preparing breakfast so I wanted to give the kitten some milk. Here... Take it. As far as I'm concerned, that is your kitten now. I wanna say you don't have to return it. The kitten will go wherever it wants to go. But it's hard to bare their nearness without being able to... touch them. I mean... You know what I mean. Yes, I guess I know. So you have to ask him for a date. At a definite place at definite time. And he will come. Surely. You understand? Never mind, Ika. Thank you. Well... Have a good day and... say hello to your parents. Goodbye. -Goodbye. They... I understand all this, Mr Tomic. -Then do it. All right. Yes? -Mr Tomic'? -It's me. I'm your friend who wishes you the best and feel sorry for you Pay more attention to your wife because she's cheating you with your neighbour Ika. -Who is that? Shall I copy also this? What? - You want me to copy this accusation? Copy it! I've already told you that. All right. Where are those acts? Didn't I tell you not to remove my acts from the desk? But they are on your desk. Of course that they are on the desk. They should be on my desk. Listen, Pera... Mr Petrovic is coming soon and I have to leave. Tell him to come tomorrow at eight. But tomorrow is Sunday. Then tell him to come on Monday. Are you going to the party tomorrow? Why do you ask? -I'm going with Ika. -You could't find a better company! He is not taking his exams, he's just having fun. You should take your exams. Is that clear? -I will, Sir. You are a good young man, Pera. Good. Would you like me to give you a head massage? As you wish. You are my big child. I'll take a good care of you. Will you call Mrs Tomic, please, I have something to show her. Excuse me for a moment. I'll be right back. Look at this. You might be intersted in buying some of these. -Let me see. You are leaving? -I have some work to finish. Should I buy these dresses? I don't know. Buy if you like them. Would you like me to try them on to see how they suit me'? I have to go to the bank. And your headache? I'm very busy today. You gonna stay long? I don't know. Don't wait for me. I love you and I want you so much. Come to my room. You came back, too. Yes. Where did you go? I went to the park, for a walk. And? You liked he park? You know how they call it? Park of a thousand kisses. Because of those couples who are dating here. You didn't know that. I know what you are trying to tell me. I didn't go there to have a date with Ika. I didn't. I was going for a walk and he accidentally saw me and walked to me. That's it. You are so bad at lying. Radmilo... Please... Didn't you want me to start loving you? And you see, I did. How can I convince you? -Don't. I'm going now. Get ready for tomorrow. Pack your things. When I come back from work, I'm taking you to the station. You are going home. To Belgrade. Pera... I'm going to the court. I'm not coming back. You can go when you finish your work. -All right, Sir. I could hear you coming. Your wife has received a telegram which says that her moher is ill. Did she find you at your office? -Yes... yes I'm going to lay the table for dinner. Sorry, I forgot...she has left a letter for you in case she doesn't find you. I know. And where. s the letter? -On your desk. -Put this away. Forgive me for all the suffering that I caused you. Although my suffering is now bigger than yours. As my love is bigger than yours. Goodbye. You are here, Sir. I've been looking for you. Yes? You have a visit. -I'm coming. Is it aunt Stana? -No. It's Miss Dara. She's waiting for you in the dining room. - All right. Mr Tomic... Have a seat please. -I have brought you some cookies. I made them for my family and than I thought... since your wife isn't here... Thank you. -Taste them. -l'll taste them later. -Just one please. Well? Do you like it? I'm glad you like it. I have come here to tell you something. If you need anything feel free to call me. I live here across the street. Although you know that... okaY- You know, anything you need... I see.. Okay. Thank you. For me nothing is hard to do... Thank you very much. So... don't hesitate... -Don't worry, I won't... Come in! Mr Tomic..-Tatjana! Come in please. I have something to tell you. Have a seat please. Sorry, I feel little uneasy. Pera, go and buy me some tobaco. Sure. You don't have to say it right now. Sit down first. No... no I will tell you everything right away. I... have to tell you something that bothers me. -I'm listening. A while ago I heard something that has to do with you. Me? -Yes. And Miss Dara. Miss Dara and I have nothing in common. - No, no... I know that. I actually heard her talking to a young man at her father's pub asking him to call you on the phone and tell you about your wife and Mr Ika. And that something's going on between the two of them. Tatjana, what are you talking about? She promised him the position of a hotel manager. When did you find out about it? -A while ago. But I wouldn't tell you because I didn't want to interfere. Then she asked him whether he had delivered Ika the letters and he said that he had. I couldn't suppose that there were such kind of people, but... I can't believe that somebody who lives in your neighbourhood is ready to do such mean things. Why didn't you tell me that before? I... Ijust didn't know that Ljiljana was so nice. I wanted to tell you but... Anyway, I told you now. Dara, my dear... let me see you! What is? -He is here. -Who'? -Mr Tomic. I didn't take him long to come...-Go and let him in. Don't keep him waiting. Good afternoon, Miss Dara. -Good afternoon. How are you'? I've never been better. Have a seat please. - Thank you. Miss Dara I wanted to tell you that I was thinking...-And? And figured out what you meant by saying that I can ask or expect anything from you. Really? -Yes. Thank you for such a generous offer. -It's nothing. -No, it's really much. And just now I have a request which, if it isn't too early, I would make. Just say it. Perhaps it will be far gone... -I'm sure it.. -Won't? -It won't. You know, it's a delicate matter. It might be too much asking such a thing from a girl like you. Well... I will not know unless you tell me. I'll tell you now. Miss Dara I would ask you to... Will you stop sticking your nose into my life? If it isn't too much to ask. Mr Tomic... -Good afernoon. I need to talk to Mr Ika. Mrlka Let's clear up about those letters. I didn't.. They are not from Ljiljana. Ika, darling, what happened'? Sir I'm not going to bed yet. If you are hungryjust let me know. I will not be hungry. Don't worry about Mrs Ljilja. She will come back. Yes, but when? I can bring you dinner here if you feel more comfortable. I am not hungry, Julija. I don't won't to eat. I just want to rest. Julija... -Yes? I'm sorry. I know that you just worry. And I know that you just worry. Good night. When did you come back? -Before you. But I told Julija not to tell you that I was here. -l'll show her! You don't check whether I am in the bedroom. You avoid that room. Good morning. -Good morning. L]ilja___ Can I ask you something? What? Why did you tell me that... That you had lost your virginity? I didn't tell you that. What do you mean, you didn't? I told you it was my secret. Will you tell me who is in that photo? Do you want me to show you? Promise me that you won't be jealous. Iwill be jealous. -In that case I can'! show you. Radmilo! Where did you find this? I stole it from Dragisa. Don't tell him. I'll show you now! LOVE ISN'T ALWAYS ON TIME
