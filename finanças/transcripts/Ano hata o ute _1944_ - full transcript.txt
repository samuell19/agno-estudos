Ano hata o ute (Shoot That Flag) Taking advantage of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the United States takes possession of the Philippine Islands. For the next 40 years, the mad U.S. expands this foothold into domination of East Asia. U.S. President Roosevelt, wanting domination of the entire Pacific, attempts to strangle Japan of resources. Our Empire, seeking to preserve peace, endures these unendurable insults and tribulations. However, the U.S. showed no sign of remorse for their continued acts of aggression.

Garcia...Angel Esmeralda Captain Ramon Reyes...Leopoldo Salcedo Japan, accepting the challenge of the Anglo-Saxons, rises in arms after having had to stand by for years watching rapacious America and Britain tread upon the enslaved peoples of East Asia. Japan's expeditionary forces are rushed to various places in the vast areas of Greater East Asia to drive out the Anglo-Saxons. The first blow in the Philippines is dealt when our warplanes raid Clark Field and Iba airfield on December 8. Japanese troops carry out a daring landing operation in the face of fierce resistance from the U.S. Army Forces of the Far East. At Aparri and Vigan in northern Luzon on December 10, and at Legaspi and Davao on December 12, Japanese troops land successfully. On December 22, huge Japanese contingents land on the shores of Lingayen Bay. - Filipino military officer's family - Aurora Garcia (mother)...Rosa Aguirre Antonio (Tony) Garcia...Ricardo Pasion Miguel Gomez (father)...Guillermo Callus Conseulo Gomez (mother)...Stena David Ludes Gomez (wife)...Norma Blanca Floor - U.S. Army officers - Captain Adams...Bert Leroy Captain Smith...Franco Garcia Thus, Imperial forces advance from three directions toward Manila, headquarters of the USAFFE. Realizing that nothing can stop the Imperial forces, Manila declares itself an open city. City of Manila Christmas Eve, 1941 Mother-in-law, are you going with Andres? Mother, what has happened to the U.S. and Philippine forces? Mom, what? Tony, be quiet. Okay. It's brother and Captain Gomez! Brother! Andres, Tony. Later. Okay. Well... Andres, Aren't you going to wish me a Merry Christmas? Of course I will. Andres. Ludes! It's good to have you back. Wait. Dad! Are the radio broadcasts true? Andres, what will happen to Manila? This too. Is that going to be enough? Sure. Brother, I have a request. What is it? Bring me an enemy soldier's helmet as a souvenir. A helmet? Yeah, an enemy's helmet. Okay, Tony. I'll bring you one when I get back. While I'm away... take care of mother. Okay. I'm going now. May God bless you. Tell me something. What do you mean? Is this a just war? Why do you ask? I have to know why my son fights. Mariano, be a brave soldier. That is my mother's wish for you. Don't worry about us. It's okay. Just leaflets. Andres, this guerrilla war is going to be hard. I know you are an honorable man, Andres. Have you forgotten anything, Andres? I'm ready. I have to go now. Mother. How are you doing? Andres, take care of yourself. You know I will. May God bless you. Good luck, Captain. Thank you. Ludes, let's go. Take care... Done worry. I'll be fine alone. I thought I wouldn't cry when you left, but... I can't help myself. What should I do if Japanese soldiers come to Manila? I don't know what to do. You can't be going to war. Ludes, it's my duty. It won't take long. I'll be back soon. You'll see. Take care of yourself. Even on the battlefield, I'll be praying for you and the children. Andres? It's time. Ludes, I have to go. Be safe. Auntie... Say hello to Mariano. I will. Let's go. God bless the two of you. Brother, remember the enemy's helmet. Sure thing. Now, prayer and hopes for the future are the only things left for you. The dawn will come when the night is done. The dawn will come. Tony, what's that? It's a Japanese leaflet. Tony, look out! Tony...Tony...Tony! Bataan Peninsula Mount Natib US-Philippine Regimental Headquarters Over there. Do it quickly. You, too. Do it right. It's so quiet. Satsuki's bombing was accurate. There were so many bombs. It's a miracle we're alive. I wonder if Manila is okay. Andy! What's going on? Captain Reyes. Be safe. How are you, Lieutenant? Well, sir. Second Lieutenant Ramos was killed in the bombing. Ramos? Yes. Anyone else? Domingo, too. He did his duty to the end. Well then... Andres. After this kind of bombing... there might be a night time attack by the Japanese. Not likely. Full moon, no clouds. Be careful anyway. I understand. Corporal Ikejima and one other now going on patrol. End. I came quietly. Let's go. Now. Anything unusual? No, nothing. I'm going down this alley. You go that way. Yes. We'll meet at the crossroads ahead. Stay alert. Thief! Help! Help! Over here! What is this? These two broke into the home of a Filipino couple. These boys helped us find and arrest the thieves. I saw that the Japanese soldiers were quick and brave. It's true. The thieves tried to get away. I chased them but thieves were too fast for us. They ran like the wind, but the Japanese soldiers caught them on a street corner. They surrendered at gunpoint. Weren't you scared of them? Why would I be scared? I thanked the Japanese soldier and shook his hand. That's not true. What? It's not a lie, though we didn't shake hands. I did too. You can ask. This is the Japanese soldier my friend was talking about. Tony...Tony! There's a Japanese soldier here. I was scared before, but now I'm fine. That's right. Like the Nazi lightning war strategy, the enemy is inflicted with continuous attacks. Forcing enemy in headlong retreat across the Abboabo river. Our Army prepares to attack the main enemy base near Mount Samat. Captain Washio reporting as ordered, sir. Last night, we captured 73 enemy soldiers and an officer. Private Yamada. Bring the captured officer to headquarters. Understood. Bring the captured officer to headquarters. Second Lieutenant Nanoka has brought the enemy officer here for interrogation. Washio. Yes. You may continue. Despite this, the Americans do not treat you as equals. Don't be under any illusions. America sees us both as Orientals. The sun may rise from the west but Filipinos will never be Americans. You're not. Just look at your history. For the last 40 years, your fathers have been holed up in the mountains of Bataan fighting for independence from the U.S. Philippine blood.. ...spilled in your own country by America. Listen carefully to this. You are pawns in America's war... against all Oriental people. You have forgotten... your Oriental heritage... and Oriental pride. There is no more American blood in you... than in any Japanese or other Oriental. None. You fight in America's war that they cannot win. The Orient belongs... ...to the Oriental people. Fighting the Japanese Army is... foolishness. We Japanese and you... ...are Oriental brothers. Never forget. You were born in the Philippines. Love the Philippines! The Orient belongs to the Oriental people. We have to take it back. If you can't understand this, you're an idiot. Nakamura. Yes. Explain this to him so he understands. I will explain it so he understands. Nanoka, the POWs will remain with you for the time being. Bring him as a guide. Yamada. The POW officer will be accompanying the regiment as guide. Understood. This is the plan of attack. When my commanding officer heard this child's story, he felt sorry for him. I don't know if he can be treated and cured. I thought you might be able to do something about it. Thank you for your kind words. I told the deputy commander I would try to help. Let's take a quick look. Does that hurt? How is he, doctor? Can anything be done? The lumbar vertebrae are damaged. Then is there any prospect at all? It would take major surgery to correct. But I can't guarantee anything. But if the parents want to try, I'll do my best. But if Tony is ever to walk again, he must have that operation. The boy is so severely debilitated. He needs a blood transfusion to survive. Is that so? My blood is type B. Would it be useful? Yes. The boy's blood is also type B. Then you can use mine. I wonder what happened to the guys who went looking for food. Maybe they got themselves killed. I heard a rumor the day before yesterday that they surrendered to the Japanese Army. Maybe we should too. Don't be a fool! Surrender and you'll be treated like a dog. U.S. military propaganda. Don't fall for that. Just propaganda the Americans want us to believe. We're still less than animals to the Americans. You know that. Look at that! It's from someone named Santos. It is from Santos. I thought he was dead. Eating well. It's a turkey. Yes, my wife and children are with me. If that is true, I'd surrender too. My son... My son fighting in Bataan. Can’t you hear me calling you? It's your mother. I’ll not say my name lest you be punished by your American officers. But I’m sure you’ll know me by my voice! I will tell you something important. There's something you need to know. I’m not speaking under the coercion of Nippon troops. We are now living peacefully in Manila which has regained its brightness. From the same home where you and Tony used to live. What I want to talk about most are the lies of the Americans. Contrary to American propaganda, the Nipponese officers and men are not at all cruel. I have been told by Nipponese friends that the aim of the Nippon forces in the present war is to liberate us from American shackles. Son, please know that we are happy. Your family lives in peace. Manila has regained its brightness. My dear son! Have faith in the words of your mother! Don't shed your blood in vain. Please give up your meaningless fight and come back to me! Please trust your mother. I say this for everyone and not just me. All mothers wish the same. From your dear mother. The POW officer asks to speak with Second Lieutenant Nanoka. Look! Goodbye! Goodbye, Ikejima-san. Goodbye, Ikejima-san. Goodbye. God, please help Mr. Ikejima. Please. In all things, we are warriors who act in accordance with the Bushido Code with rectitude and complete loyalty to the Emperor. Your actions on the field of battle shall force the enemy to end their futile resistance to our forces. It is America who is our enemy. They are no brother to East Asia. We are here to convey this essential truth. During this time, we have endured numerous difficult operations and endured many dangers. The decision has been made that we must now make a general attack on Bataan. Knowing that this this war was unavoidable, we know that Heaven will guide our efforts. We weep for our long-suffering Oriental brothers as we fight the true enemy, the United States. In front of us are the Invaders of East Asia. With the United States trembling with ambition for the conquest of East Asia, there can only be one course of action for us. Consequently, our attack must be remorselessly ferocious. Why stay here? Get out! Never come back! Mother was right about everything. Mariano! Still chasing the Americans, plans begin for the final attack on Corregidor. May 5th - Ramao - Prior to our landing, artillery will fire 5,000 shells at Corregidor Island, smashing everything above the ground. Hayami unit will be the first to depart. Departure time is 20:00. Main landing at 23:30. Artillery barrage in support of landing begins at 22:30. First, to isolate and destroy any enemy outposts. Second, to prevent enemy reinforcements moving to the landing destination or flanks. Finally, concentrated fire on the landing destination to start at 22:30. Then from 22:45 to 23:00 rolling barrage starting at the waterline to support the advance of our landing force and tanks. There is no fresh water on Corregidor. Therefore, the only water you will have is what you carry with you. The two canteens you carry must last you three days. Food for one week. Once ashore, expect three or four days of hard fighting. Shoot and shoot and shoot even for a week! Shoot them all! The American soldiers will be waiting for you. Never raise your voice when you get on a boat. If you are hit by a bullet, think of His Majesty the Emperor and say "Banzai!" in your heart. Got it? Yes! Good. From now on, we will all do our best to follow the plan the commander has given us. Sushi and ice cream will now be distributed. Take your places. Eat and enjoy. End. While you and I have lived together for a long time, we've never learned to speak each other's language. Now we must part company. You may not understand me now, but you must feel the mutual sympathies between us. I don't even know what I say now. But we have gone through a lot together. You understand my heart and mind. That's all. Captain Gomez, just understand one thing. Japan and the Philippines, we're not enemies with each other. Japan, Philippines...Peace Then be well. Do your best for the Philippines. Goodbye. Sir, it's time. Alright. We're going ashore. Hey, Washio. Yes. Have our artillery shell enemy troops on our right flank. Then charge forward. Yes. Cease-fire agreement? Afternoon of May 6th, 1942 - On Corregidor, enemy general Wainwright surrenders the US Army Far East Forces. Ten hours after landing, Corregidor fell. Hereby, with the total surrender of the U.S. Far East Forces, this operation is now completed. This is the result of your tremendous fighting spirit. I was extremely moved by the experience. But the battle is not over. Now, the real battle begins. This is the oath you have taken. Now I feel my true self. I will not die even if enemy bullets hit me. You also shouldn’t die. We will cease fighting only when we dictate our terms in Washington! Neither distance nor obstacles shall hamper us. Our operations in the Philippines are of great significance in that we have come to know the enemy’s true colors. Our enmity and our indignation should be directed toward Washington beyond the Pacific! The war has only started. We will now honor His Majesty the Emperor. Now!
