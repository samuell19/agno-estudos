Birds of Exile Don't tarry. Selim, Murat, Hatice, Fatma, Kemal. Alright, everyone is here. Watch out, don't lose each other. This is Istanbul, after all. -You need anything, grandpa? -No. Be on your way! Alright, let's go. God willing, we will be like kings in this city. Kings! Look at us! Together, we can do anything. We'll make this city kneel before us! -We will! Off you go. Get down! Let me go! Get your hands off! What's this? Why are you dragging him? He got on the train in Kayseri. He had no ticket. I made him leave. Somehow, he got back on the train. I told them, I dropped and lost my ticket. Then I caught him and made him leave again. This is his third time. Stop fooling around! Let's catch that ferry. You can't run away from me. Get up, you rascal! Who are you to tell me to get up and leave? Am I not a son of this nation as well? My granddad was killed by a Moscow-bullet, in the war of '93; and my father was killed by a Greek-bullet, in Sakarya. So what if I lost my ticket? Can't the ferry go on without my ticket? What's the big deal. You think you'll get a promotion just because you caught me? I forgive you, this once! I'll pay for your ticket myself. But never again! Again? Of course not! This is the last time you shall ever see me! Can I bum a cigarette, sir? There you go. Thanks. If you don't seize an opportunity, someone else will. Cigarettes cost money, the ferry costs money, it costs money to eat and sleep. What am I to do? I have no money, and I have no one. Don't you agree, sir? And your father's military pension? What pension are you talking about? I don't even know my father and mother. But you've found an easy way to make ends meet. What else can I do? I have no father, no mother, no woman, and I have no brain. I don't even know how to read and write. I need money, and this is the only way I can make a living. The people of Istanbul would call you a lowlife. Look brother, I don't care what they call me. I'll twist their arms before they realize what's happened to them. No matter how rich you are, your money is no good on the other side. Look at this city. Istanbul, the city of plenty. You harlot, watch out. This rascal will be your new king. A king! In all our hearts was the same desire: to conquer this city. After our business in Maras went belly up, we had no choice but to sell our shop, and our family home. We had to try and make it in Istanbul, the city of gold, as they called it. We were to open a repair shop and manage it with my two eldest sons: Selim and Murat. My younger son, Kemal, had just finished high school and wanted to go to university. My daughter, Fatma, was to help out her mother in house chores. We had come here once before with Selim and picked out a house we could afford. -Welcome. -Thank you, thank you. Do you know where our landlady is? She was around here, sir. Kids, go have a look. I wish we were over on that side. Welcome, welcome. I was waiting for your arrival. Rukiye's son, our neighbor, fell down from a wall while trying to climb it, and he hurt his foot. I had gone over to have a look at him. Please, come on in. It's hard to go on without a man. I wouldn't wish it on my enemy. "It's better that you die first, rather than your man" they say. This place looked so different while my dearly departed was still alive. My house may look a bit run down, but it's sturdy, I tell you. Every one of my tenants have been satisfied with it. And God bless my tenants too, they always paid their rents on time. Whatever the needs of the house may be, they never made any excuses and paid for it themselves. They were honorable people. Maybe it's because I'm a widow, my tenants always took pity on me. If some part of the house needed repairs, they would always pay for it themselves. God's my witness, they would even pay a couple months rent all at once, in advance. Just so that their poor landlady would put her mind at ease. Here are your keys. You can find out the rest for yourselves. It's not my house, but yours, after all. I hope you have a nice stay. Good deeds last forever, they say. I'll leave you to it and have another look at that kid. Goodbye. This meager dinner will have to do, for tonight. We should be thankful, some people can't even find this much. But once we get started out on the business... We'll have butter and honey every day. Coming here was the right decision. I told you... Hang on there. How do you know that the repair shop will work out? Son, why did you have to sour our mood by saying such a thing? Why do you darken our mood? Your brothers are older than you. Do you think they haven't thought this through? But, Kemal said nothing bad. Shut up! Don't interrupt while we're talking. Go, get us some clean napkins. You're too easy on this girl. She keeps meddling while we're talking. Let's see what tomorrow brings. After we take over the shop, tomorrow... We paid the deposit, right? Son, this is Istanbul. If you buy an egg here, you better check to see if it has yolk inside. It's fine, we've paid the deposit, the shop is as good as ours. It will run like clockwork. -We're all looking forward to it. -That we are. God willing, if things go our way and we strike gold, -I know what I'll do, first thing. -What's that? I know what father will do, he'll go back to Maras and show off to Yakup. My son knows how I think. A British dark blue jacket on my back, a Serkisof watch, with a chain from here to here, bright yellow shoes on my feet, I'll buy everyone a round of raki, it will be on me! Yo go, father! We will be like kings here. Kings! Let me tell you a few things: When you get out of the house, your first step should be with your right. And, never leave the house without prayer. Alright, let's head over to the shop. -Hello. -Hello. -Are you doing alright? -Yes. -That's great. What's your name? -Fatma. And I'm Mualla. -We're here, there it is. -That's it? Are you sure? What? Don't you like it? All of this just for that money? Doesn't make sense. Wait till you see the kind of deal your father managed to pull off! Pay no heed to this kid, father. -Hey, sonny! Look over here! You! -Yes, sir. -Where's your boss? -There he is. -Tell him to come over here. -Sure. Yes, sir. How can I help? What's this? Don't you know how to read? Read it. I see, you've paid some deposit. Why should I care? Hear that? He says "why should I care"! It seems you haven't gotten the news. Long story short, we've come to take over this shop. These are my sons. You understand, now? Grandpa, you're sorely mistaken. What mistake are you talking about? We came here 20 days ago. There was that guy, we told him our story, told him we were looking for a workshop, he led us all the way over here. We then went to Sirkeci with him, we had tea with him in a cafe. All the storekeepers around here saw us! We bargained with him for hours, then we paid the deposit! There is no mistake! I see now what's happened, grandpa. Those jackals must have conned you. The owner of this place is a woman. Ms. MÃ¼nire. She inherited the shop from her late husband. And, did you really think you could buy a business like this for that money? The lady doesn't need the money, either, the shop is doing just fine. It was as if our world had fallen apart. We were helpless. We had been robbed of our money, and we had no one to turn to in Istanbul. But, we gathered ourselves after a while. We put together what little we had, and opened our own little shop. We began working, day and night, all together. There was another repair shop across from us. The owner was Greek. Master Panait, he was called. We didn't understand what those guys were saying. But, the wife this guy had... What a woman she was. The kind that lies in every man's heart. She'd be bringing food to their shop every now and then. I also caught Murat checking her out. And, how could he not look at her? The bitch was called Despina. Then I caught her looking over to our side, to me. My heart almost stopped. Kemal started university. He wanted to become a doctor. He made some good friends over there, he told us. He said they helped him out with everything, and that he didn't feel like a stranger. Murat got bored of the shop after a while. He started to work as a taxi driver. He turned out to be as reckless as the rest of the Istanbul taxi drivers. You asshole! Watch out! Whoever gave you a driving license... What's this? Give me 2.5 more. Is it 7.5 lira from Edirnekapi to Sarachane? Shut up and pay 2.5 more! You're charging more than your fare. What's your plate number? Give me 2.5 more, then you can complain all you want. That's it. Now, off you go. He wasn't afraid of anything. He could snatch the food out of a lion's mouth. Taxi! Over here! Sir! Yes, you! Taxi, over here! He doesn't even look at us. Sir, over here! Taxi! Slow down, man. Leave some business for us! Go ahead, have I tied you down? Pretty lady! Sister! What, don't you like the cut of our jib? Sir! You, with the luggage! Hey, it's you, the rascal. What's happened to you? You were supposed to be Istanbul's new king? And a king I will be. But, life has its ups and downs, you know. You're all talk, rascal. Look at you, you're quite far away from kinghood. That's what you think. But to climb, you have to start at the bottom of the ladder. If we live long enough, you'll see. Alright, go and feed yourself, if you can. Some king you turned out to be, fool. Thank you, sir. Porter here! I'll carry your luggage! What have you bought, Fatma? Just groceries, for dinner. -Where are you coming from? -I'd been sewing. Here you are, sir. Look at those two, they've already started eating. Wait for the other kids. Hello mother. Hello father. Hello brother. And hello, university boy! I'm famished, bring whatever we have. Hold on a minute, let's wait for Fatma. Where is she? She went to the market to get groceries. Why send her, when this guy is just sitting here? I've told you a thousand times, girls aren't supposed to go out by themselves. But, who listens! -Why didn't you go? -I was studying. He was studying! It's 15 minutes of work! You could've gone and come back to your study! And where will all this studying lead? Will you become a sage? Who knows? Maybe I will. Earning your daily bread is all that matters. Nothing else! If you had any brains, you'd realize that! That doesn't concern you. How dare you talk back to me! Look at me, Murat! No one makes up rules in my house while I'm still in it. Whether I send my son to the university, or whether I send my daughter to the market, is up to me! Father, I don't want Fatma to go out by herself as well. You remember what happened to Naciye, our neighborâs daughter, back in Maras. She ran away to Istanbul, and vanished. I drive a taxi in this city, father. If you only knew what kinds of girls I see every day! This place is not Maras. A young girl in this city. They'd eat her alive! CITY THEATER The set was marvelous. The mise-en-scene was a bit dull. It was alright. I think the actors did the heavy lifting. -It's not too late, how about we go have some cake at the cafe. -Let's go. I'm sorry, I have to head back home. -You guys have fun. -Too bad. See you, then. -And you, Kemal? -I'll walk Ayla back home. Kemal has somehow become Ayla's favorite. What do you care! My father is having some guests tonight. Mother told me to come back early. And here I am, going to the theater. I'll get a good scolding. I'm sure your mother wouldn't do that. May God bring you together. May everything you touch turn to gold. -May God always be on your side. -Alright, enough. -I don't agree with what you did. -Because I gave alms? Of course. She's a healthy woman. She can work. Is this why she left her hometown? It's easy to beg. Leave your village, then come rob the people of Istanbul! You think the outsiders come to rob the people of this city? I don't care why they come here, Kemal. Look what they turned Istanbul into. They are everywhere. -And, why do you care about them? -I don't know... Wait, are you one of them? Of course not! My family are natives of Istanbul. The only village I know is "Kadikoy". What's up? Have a look at the carburetor. I'm in a hurry. I can't do it right now. I have to go. I always come here! Why do you leave me hanging like this! Yes sir, how can I help? -Have a look at the carburetor. -At once! -Why are you following me? -I want to talk to you. We can't talk here. What if someone sees us? Then let's meet somewhere else. Thee mou! What do you want from me? She didn't put up a fight. But, because of her husband, she insisted that we meet during work hours. We had nowhere to meet. Our only choice was the park. When she asked me what I wanted, I showed her, plain and simple. Enough! Someone will see us. Despina, my baby, my love. I want you too, but we can't be here. Where should we go? What about our house? But, what about the neighbors? Look. When we come to our street, you follow me from 100 meters behind. -Entaksei? -Alright, let's go. Slow down! You're hurting me. Come here. Greetings. Where is that boy of yours? God damn him! How would I know. -But, I needed him for... -He's not here. Cut it out! How odd... Yes sir. How can I help? -What do I owe you? -25 lira. -25 lira? -Is that too much? Of course. How can this cost 25 lira? The job I've done costs 25 lira. That's what I'm telling you. We've been ripped off again. Look here! If it's too much, take your money and shut up! -What if I talk? -I'll show you! I don't need customers like you. Don't come here again! Selim. Selim! It's getting late. You have to go. You have to go. When will we meet again? Tomorrow, at the same hour. But Despina, these are work hours. I'm always sneaking out of work. My father is going crazy. You don't want to come? -Are you bored with me? -How could I be? I'm mad about you! Fatma! Hello, Mualla. -Hello Fatma, where are you going? -Back home. Why don't you come in? But, I'm late. They won't stop nagging me about it. Come on, stop making excuses. I'm opening the door. Come on in, darling. What have you been up to? I haven't seen you in a while. Don't ask, Mualla. I can't lift my head up from all the house work. I cook for everyone, I clean the house, and then there's laundry too. It never ends! But I've heard you always go to the cinema. I wish. I can only go once in a while. And I can only go with my family. But, how can you stay locked up? You're young and pretty. Don't you ever want to go outside? Of course I want to, but... Yes? My older brothers. Especially Murat. -Nonsense... -Why? They're always at work. They can't keep an eye on you all the time. It's true, but, you know... I was about to go to the cinema. How about we go together? How can I, Mualla? They'll kill me! Coward. You're a fool. But you just have to see this film. I've seen it before. This is my third time. I have no more tears left to cry! Yes, I've heard good things about it too. But I can't go today. No way! Maybe some other day. My mother must be waiting for me. -Another day, then. You promise? -If something doesn't come up. We'll make up an excuse for you. Then, we put on our make up, and go. But I don't have any makeup. Don't worry, I've got that covered. Come on, let's try it out. Let's start with your hair. That's it. You have to start taking care of yourself. Wait a minute. This is an eyeliner. Then a little bit of lipstick. -But... -Hold still. Alright. Take off your clothes and try this on. -Are you done? -Yes. Now, take a look at yourself. Was that really me? No, it was the neighborâs daughter! What a question. You don't realize how beautiful you are. I love you so much! -Guys, I have to go. -To where? -To home, mother is waiting. -And you, Kemal? -I'm heading over to Beyoglu. Good day. -See you. -Do you have siblings, Kemal? -Me? I have none. How about you? I have an older brother, a doctor, he's in the USA. What's he doing there? -He's settled down there. -Why? What didn't he like about his homeland? I don't know. Good to see you, little sir. I hope you're enjoying yourself. Hop in, I'll take you wherever you're going. Don't be shy, girl! Get in! I happen to be the older brother of this idiot. So, where are we going? Ayla was headed to Cihangir. So the young lady is called Ayla. Nice. You idiot, why didn't you let us know about this pretty friend of yours? Forgive me for being crass, miss. I'm just overly sincere. We like to kid around with Kemal like that. What're you going to do? We weren't like this back home. -Where are you from? -Didn't Kemal tell you? We're from Maras. We're immigrants from Maras, you understand. Our father runs a repair shop with our eldest brother. Business is a bit slow, nowadays. You see, we do all the work, and Kemal here reaps the benefits. But if he becomes a doctor, at least we won't have to pay for a prescription, or our medicine. Thank you, sir. I hope we haven't been a burden for you. Of course not, miss. It was a pleasure. -Ayla, wait. -What lies will you tell me now? Ayla, let me explain. "I'm from Istanbul", "I'm the only son of a wealthy family"! What's with all the lies! I wanted to talk about that, but you don't listen. No explanation is needed. It's clear as day. Please, don't bother me from now on. I don't have to deal with your lies. Good for you, man! Nice broad you got there! You've gained my respect, a little bit. Brother. Brother! Did you hear about what this guy did? Who? He had such a hot broad with him today. -You don't say. -I swear. What a fine girl she was. Is she from the university? What's with the long face? Don't forget where you came from. This is Istanbul. We'll have our day in the sun as well, eventually. If you've found your princess, then I'll get my queen. My queen... I couldn't forget about her. I went to her workplace. She passed by me, but she didn't even look at me. If she saw me, she would've smiled, and sat next to me, I was sure. After she was done with her dance, I was still hoping she'd notice me. But instead, she went to the table of those old codgers. Damn it! She was so classy. Her laugh, the way she talked... Waiter! If money is enough to make her laugh, then I'd pay the price, and make her laugh! -Is that you, Mr. Driver. Hello. -Hello. Please, have a seat. You were a customer of mine, and now I'm a customer of yours. Is that so? The champagne arrived. We made small talk, about the weather and whatnot. She said: "Let's dance". But I don't know how! "Let's not", I replied. When the bill arrived, I almost fainted. There was nothing left in my pocket. I'd visit her often, in the nights. A light drink... Then I'd watch her from afar. What else could I do? It was as if the bitch knew that I had no money. She would ignore me. What's going on here! You can't act like this! Wait a minute. Murat. All of you want the same thing. Come. Get your prize, for your help. You cow! Who do you think I am, one of those sleazy pimps? Wear these rags for your sugar daddies, not for me! Put these on! You don't know me. Murat, wait. Please, don't leave. Forgive me, I beg you. I'm afraid to be alone. Stay with me tonight. Get up. -HÃ¼seyin is that guy's name, right? -Yes. What does he want with you? He's a real scumbag. He runs an agency, for performers. He hired me, put me on the stage. He takes a share of my earnings and still I owe him money. My debt to him never ends and he doesn't let me leave. Says I'm supposed to be performing in other places, too. Just so that he can turn a profit, for his commission, you know. I don't understand that business. It's not for me. But, don't be afraid. They can't treat you that way when I'm with you. You'll forgive me, won't you? I'll think about it. Now, get some sleep. But, where will you sleep? That couch is good enough for me. Get me that blanket. That's settled, then. Goodnight. To you, too. In all my time in Istanbul, this is the first time a woman has brought me tea. And she's a... You're saying, she's a loose woman, like me. What great misfortune. -Don't you like me? -No. I don't. But you do love me. What? Where did you get that idea? Who do you think you are? Why would I love you? You're right. I've caused you much trouble. But you still love me, I can see that. No, I don't. I hate you! Don't deny it. Your mouth utters those words but your eyes say otherwise. Tell me you love me. Go on. I love you. I'm mad about you! Stop chasing skirt! You sold us out for that heathen broad! Damn you. Please, leave me alone Selim. I want to talk. Why are you running away? We should stop seeing each other, Selim. Whatever we've done... It was a mistake. How can you say that, Despina? We love each other. You can't end this! No, Selim. I don't love you. I never did! And, all that's happened between us? I did it for my husband. While you were kissing me, making love to me, I'd be praying to God for my husband's business to thrive. -I have a son, he's 7. -Why have I never seen him? I'd send him off to school every time we meet. I didn't want you to know. How little you'd think of me, if you only knew. What we've done is a great sin. But, I did it for my family! There was no other way! Hit me! Go ahead! Thank God, we're together once more. I was beginning to think that some of you had forgotten the way back home. Listen carefully now. The shop is not doing well. We're losing business. Those heathens are clever, they got the better of us. We hardly even see Murat anymore, can't expect anything from him. Why did we come here in the first place! Maybe it's best that we return home. How about you earn some money and help us out, instead of talking? Why would we go back? Go see who it is, daughter. Whether we go back or not, we can decide later. First of all, we have to close down the shop. It can hardly pay for it's rent. -Is your father home? -Yes. I want to talk with him, but I can never catch him. Good evening. -Good evening. -Welcome. Please, have a seat. Don't stand up on my account! I wanted to say, these are hard times... Trying times... Maybe it's because of the evil in men. I can hardly get by. You know how it is. You're in the same boat. Money doesn't grow on trees. What is a poor widow like me to do? I thought I'd tell my tenants about my situation, speak to their conscience. Long story short, do you mind if I raise the rent, just a little bit? It is as you said, money doesn't grow on trees, and we're in dire straits too. If it was any different, and we were making any money... Isn't that right, Hatice? Believe me when I say, Miss, father and son, they open the shop every day and then come back without getting a single customer all day. I see, but... We can pay more if business picks up. You see how it is. This house is my only hope. Goodbye. All we needed was this old hag! As I was saying, I see only one way out for us. What's that? There's this old car. It's a piece of junk, but it doesn't matter, better for us that way. If we had some cash in hand, we could buy that car. -The rest is easy. -Father, I know about that car. It's done for. -It's junk! -I don't care! It's impossible to put it back together. They call me "Tahir the scrap master". I've been a scrap dealer for ages. You know your good old father, about the junk I've managed to piece back together. Let's hand over the shop. And with that money, let's pay the first installment for that totaled car. But I'm not sure if the money from the shop will be enough for that. How do we cover the deficit? That's the question. I don't have a single penny. Same with me. Here, husband, take these. -What are these? -Bracelets and whatnot. I'd been keeping them for our daughter's wedding, I'd bought them with my savings over the years. You're a life saver, my strong wife. You see your mother, kids? Good for you, my wife! We must have been made for each other. We set out on this road, together. We shall not give up for as long as we have the strength. And those who want to, can leave! Let's say you bought that junk, and repaired it. How much could you make with it each day? Next to nothing. -15, 20 lira. -These kids, they don't know anything! What's your guess? With me at the helm, 40 or 50 lira at the very least! Not possible. Let's say 30, then. That makes 900 lira each month. Let's set aside 200 for the installments of the car. -What's left? -700. Leave 400 for me, for the needs of the house. Alright, you can have it. What's left, then? 300. Another 200 is for the rent. 100 is left. That means a profit of 100 lira each month, just from me. Then we could sell that junk, add the money we've made, and buy a brand new car, straight from the dealer! Then, father, you wouldn't have to work no more. Or, he can play backgammon at the cafe all day long! What are you talking about? You think I'll stop working any time soon? My husband is far stronger than you younglings, even at his age. Hear that! My wife of 40 years has that to say about me! Come here. The things we've been through, the two of us... My wife knows what I was like when I was young. Tell them! Only I know that, and God almighty! Murat can then take care of the car, and we can get to work with Selim. We shall work without halt! After we're done with the payments of the car, we put aside half of our profits, and start saving for the second car. Understand? It could work... With persistence... May God be on our side. God will look out for us in these dark times, -one day they shall end. -Of course they'll end! Then, and only then, will we be the rulers of this harlot they call Istanbul! We shall be kings! Kings! I haven't forgotten about you, my daughter. We'll replace those bracelets that I'd gotten for my poor girl. -What would you like to have, daughter? -Me? A cuckoo clock! -Fatma, hurry up. We're late. -I'm almost done. Me and Mualla had become very close. Secretly, I went to the cinema with her a couple of times. After the film, we'd go to a cafe to have some cake and lemonade. My folks didn't suspect a thing. We started going out frequently. We'd wander around. And then, one day... Hello, Ms. Mualla. How are you? -Thank you, Mr. Orhan, and you? -Thank you. -Who is this nice young lady? -My neighbor, Fatma. Nice to meet you. Why don't you bring Ms. Fatma with you next time we meet. -We'll go, won't we Fatma? -I... don't know. Why did you hesitate? I rarely leave the house. We'll try to come. My father and my brothers had left early that day to buy that junk automobile. I quickly put on the dress Ms. Mualla had tailored for me. I told my mother that I was going to Ms. Mualla's, that we were going to do some knitting together, and left the house. I went to Ms. Mualla's. I was curious about where she'd take me. Welcome, ladies. It's hot inside, let me get your coats. -We almost gave up all hope. -Sorry, we couldn't come earlier. Please, come in. Guys, listen. Our dear Ms. Mualla has brought a new friend with her tonight. Fatma! A new friend among our ranks. This calls for a celebration! Long live Mualla! Long live Mualla! May we all live long, together. Come on, Mualla, let's not wait any longer. -Guys, I'm leaving Fatma with you. -Of course. -You seem so calm. -Are you bored with us? Not at all. Can I have this dance? I'm sorry, I don't know how to dance. Come on, stop pulling our leg. -Would you like some? -No, I don't drink. -Why not? -Who knows, maybe she's fasting. Are you really fasting? -But, it's not Ramadan yet. -Oh, that's right! -I pass... -Me too. -How are you, Ms. Fatma. -Thank you, sir. -Did you like the place? -Yes, very much. It's just like in the movies. -And you never came to one of these parties before? -No. -Ms. Mualla. -Yes? Where'd you find this frigid rube? In the fridge! She doesn't dance, doesn't drink, doesn't talk. What's she doing here? You're right. But perhaps we can find a way. Follow me. Mr. Orhan, why didn't you offer Fatma a drink? She doesn't drink. What? That's nonsense. Give me that glass. -Come on, Fatma, don't be a killjoy. -Please, don't... I'll pour it on you! -And now, this. -But, Ms. Mualla... Put on some folk music on the pickup. They're saying you don't know how to dance. Let's show them, together. Come on, Fatma. Come on! Come on! Start dancing! Come on, I said! Good for you, Fatma. Look at her go! I don't understand these men. It's just a folk dance, after all. She's got their attention, though. You think so? Check this out, then. BÃ¼lent, change the music! Go on, Fatma. You can do even better! -Come on, Fatma! -You're prettier! Take off your clothes! No! Come back here! Give me back my clothes! -Where's Ms. Mualla? -I don't know. She was just here. I'll have this dance, Ms. Fatma. I don't know how to dance. -It's fine, we'll manage. -Please, stop! This isn't right! -Leave her alone! -What's it to you! Back off! What kind of man does that! He must've had too much to drink. Where's Ms. Mualla, I haven't seen her in a while. I don't know. -Are you looking for Mualla, darling? -Yes, where's she? She's in that room. You're not enjoying this place. Let me take you home, I have a car. -If you don't mind. -Of course not. Even though I'm a man, I didn't enjoy that place. It's my first time here, too. I wouldn't have expected Ms. Mualla to behave like that. Ms. Mualla is Mr. BÃ¼lent's fiancee. They'll get married soon. What! That bitch... -Thank you for your trouble. -Please, it was no trouble at all. When and where can we meet again? I don't know. -Are you afraid of me? -No, that's not it, but... I'll come here in 3 days with the car and pick you up at 2 o'clock. I'll try to make it. Goodbye. What were you doing out in the streets at this hour, unacceptable! Where's that bitch! -What happened? -Where's she? She's in the bathroom. Why are you shouting? Let me go! I didn't do anything! Let her go, brother! You're killing her! Back off! Leave her alone! Do you know what she's done? What's she done? I saw her in a car with some guy! I'm her father, not you! No one can punish my children in my house, but me! Father, didn't you hear what he said? A girl can't go wandering around like this! Have you forgotten about Naciye, back home? Murat is looking out for our family's honor. I'm not dead yet, Selim! It falls on me alone to think about our family's honor! I've brought her up, not you! Instead of all this bickering, take a look at yourselves first! The shop went under because Mr. Selim couldn't stop chasing skirt! And Mr. Murat has become a vagabond, doesn't even cross our street anymore. You're all talk, but when it comes to it, you're not helping us out with anything! Listen, you slut, if I hear of something like this again I'll break your legs! It's over now. Stop crying. It hurts all over. Didn't you see how he hit me? He's your brother after all. He couldn't help it. He was trying to protect you, so that you don't go astray. Look what he's done to me! He cut my hair! What has he done to me! Don't worry, we can fix that. And a little bit here... A little bit there... Have a look, do you like it? I think it's even prettier than before. Really... Stop crying. Smile for me. Now, repeat after me: -"I'll be a good girl from now on". -I'll be a good girl from now on. -"I won't go off the right path". -I won't go off the right path. -"I won't let down my dear brothers". -I won't let down my dear brothers. Even though I'd made that promise, I couldn't help it, I'd made a promise to Orhan as well. He was waiting for me in his car. It didn't feel right to stand him up like that. We met with Orhan a couple of times after that day. No one saw us. I really liked him. He showed me that he liked me too, in his own way. We meant no harm. We were to get married, after all. -When will we get married? -Soon. What are we waiting for? It's about my family, there's an inheritance issue, we'll get married right after it's resolved. -I'm afraid, Orhan. -Why? My brothers might do something terrible to us. Murat, especially, is a real menace. If he knew about this... -That's why we have to... -I understand, Fatma. Don't worry, everything will be alright soon. What time is it? 5 minutes to 4. Let's head back, I shouldn't be late. You're right, darling. Seval. Seval. -My love. -We have to go. It's still too early. -Is this a new way of waking me up? -You could say that. Alright, I'm getting up. Come on, get up. -Would you like some breakfast? -Breakfast? People are about to eat dinner. Are you still mad at me? How could I be mad at the queen of Istanbul. -Are you happy? -Of course. My greatest desire has come true. What's that? I always wanted a lover from Istanbul. Finally, fortune smiles on me. The queen of Istanbul is mine at last. Now I know for sure, there is nothing like a woman from Istanbul. But, I'm not from Istanbul. What? Where are you from, then? I'm from Maras. Cut it out! Then I would've recognized you, I'm from Maras as well. You don't say! Why didn't you tell me this before. While we're at it, let me confess, my real name is Naciye, not Seval. Naciye, of the Erengil family? That's right. The world has screwed me over once again, it seems. What rotten luck is this? What's wrong, don't you want me anymore because I'm not from Istanbul, my "fellow countryman"? Not at all. I'm Murat, from the Bakircioglu family. -You are Ms. Hatice's son? -That's right. I remember your house was close to ours. I remember your family. How they looked for you, in vain. They feared you might be dead. If they only knew... Don't! I'd rather that they think I'm dead. I'm dead inside, anyway. I wish we never left Maras. Perhaps we could be happy there, together. I don't think so. Our houses were so close, and still we never met. My father was about to marry me to some man that I didn't know and didn't love. I was to get out of one prison, only to enter another. And if we met later on, it would've been too late. With all the kids I would've had. Hello? Seval? There is no one here by that name. Who was that? No one. Wrong number. Naciye. My love. Stop calling me that. My name is Seval. Please, don't let anyone know about this. Naciye is dead. She's not coming back. Let's forget about her. Hello? Yes? This is Seval. Who? Is that you, Fuat? Was that you that just called? It's possible. What do you care? You mind your own business, buddy! How's business, grandpa? Is that really you, rascal? It's me. Where'd you get the car? It looks cumbersome. What're you going to do, rascal. Only God is infallible. So, you went from being a mechanic, to driving this junk as a taxi. That's about it, rascal. And what about your conquest of Istanbul? Not much progress, I see. Just you wait! You'll see. I just rule over this area, for now. If you live long enough, you'll see this rascal rise as the new king of Istanbul. You can't make a king out of a parking attendant. I've risen from being a porter to being a parking attendant. I haven't fallen from being a mechanic to being a cabbie, like you! Alright then, when you become king, don't forget about us. Here's your due. But, this tip is not enough. Come now, don't let a little bit of money get in the way of our friendship. Now I believe it, you can actually become a king. Thank you! Alright, come, this way. Hello, sweetie. Tell Cemal I said hello, let him know about my situation. You didn't use to be like this, Seval. Well, I've changed now. I'll still give you a call. Maybe you'll change your mind. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Who's that? Just an old friend. What's his customer number? Don't start with that... I told you many times to stop seeing these men! Do you think I'll stop seeing all my friends just because you say so? Of course you will. Really? You think I'm your private concubine? Speak properly, or else! I've had enough of this! Seval, wait. Did I upset you? You always break my heart. It's because I love you. Come on, let's make up and forget about it. Nice one you got there, Ms. Seval! We've been there too, you know! What'd you say, you ponce? Watch your mouth, you clown! Or we'll show you! Son of a dog! Stop! Separate them! Come on, this is no way to behave. We can't find peace here, Seval. Let's get married, and leave. And go where? Doesn't matter. Back to Maras, maybe. -Not in a million years. -Why? I won't jump back into the pit I crawled out of. Somewhere else, then. And what would we do? We'll work and earn our bread. We can do that anywhere. I can't settle down for a slice of bread. I want to live comfortably, to dress nice. And, we're used to Istanbul. Once you're used to this city, you can never feel at home anywhere else. Why are we talking about all this? I love you, and I need you. What else do you want? We're getting along. I can't bear all this. It makes my blood boil! There's no other way. I won't be coming to the club anymore. I'm done with all that. I can't stand it. As you wish. I'll go see my father. I'll come pick you up at midnight after the club closes. Why won't you start! What's wrong, grandpa? Can I help? As you can see, -the car got sick again. -Stand aside. It's got cancer, gramps, cancer! -It's out of commission. -I know, son, I know. If you know, why do you keep trying? I thought, maybe if I asked nicely... If that doesn't work, try kissing it next. -So long. -Goodbye, sonny. Come on, boy. Don't let me down. Don't hang me out to dry. Ayla stopped talking to me for quiet some time. My lies had hurt her pride. I knew it, she still liked me. But she was being stubborn, and refused to forgive me. ...Between the ages of 5 and 10, the pulse is around 90 BPM... But I was sure that one day her heart would grow soft. And that's what happened. I didn't miss this opportunity, and set out to make peace with her. Have I still not served my sentence? Was my crime really that severe? But, why did you lie to me, Kemal? Was that really necessary? I didn't want your opinion of me to change, Ayla. Why would it change? You don't like the people who come here from the countryside. I was afraid that, if you knew I was one of them, it would ruin our friendship. You were wrong, Kemal. Your fears were unfounded. I couldn't think of that, because I love you. I couldn't risk losing you. I trust in you, Kemal. Please, don't breach that trust ever again. I won't, Ayla. Never. I promise. Hello, sonny, what're you doing here? Nothing, rascal. You look different, what're you doing now? It doesn't matter what job I do, I could make money just by walking around. But, I'm an auctioneer, for now. And you, what do you do? These days, I don't have a job. Come work for me, then. I need men like you. I have a dozen people like you working for me, now. You can't start idling around, this is Istanbul, they'll rob you blind the moment you blink. How much would I earn? I'll give you a 100, just for you! -Alright, then. -Let's go. Where are we going, Orhan? To our summerhouse, by the Bosphorus. That's where we'll live. I hope you like it. Come on. Was it you, sir? It's me, Bekir. -How are things? -Thank you, sir. Here you are... What a beautiful house. It'll be yours too, soon. It's chilly, isn't it? I don't know, I started shivering... I'll get some cognac, it'll warm you up. Let's drink. It'll warm us up. It tastes like poison. Try again. It'll be good for you. It works! It's like there's a fire inside me now. I told you. You're alright now. Now it feels too hot! This is like a dream. That dream will come true, Fatma. One day, our little kids will be running around in this room. Running around sounds like fun! Orhan can't catch me! You can't catch me! You can't catch me! Here I come! Orhan can't catch me! Stay back! Don't! What a gorgeous room! And all this furniture... After we're married, all this will be yours. It's so soft! Lie down. Relax. It's so comfy. Take off your shoes, get comfortable. I feel sleepy, now that I've lied down. Go ahead and sleep. I feel sleepy too. May I lie down next to you? You may, but no naughty business! What a happy couple we'll be... Will we see those days? Of course. Very soon. Orhan, darling. Let's not do something wrong. What can be wrong between husband and wife? Why are you crying sweetie? This is nothing to feel sad about. We'll get married, anyway. What if your parents don't want me? I'll handle them. If my brothers knew about this... They'd kill me! If you're worried, you can stay here. Orhan, my love. You're my everything! Let's go, if you're ready. They saw you with that man again, is it true? Of course not, brother! I don't know, but, mind yourself! Next time will be different! Hear that, Fatma? I don't want to deal with your nonsense too, in all this! I'll break your legs! Let's not make them wait, kids. My girl, my daughter... We're barely hanging on. Don't get tempted by the devil and add to our troubles. I won't, mother. I promise. I won't make that mistake again. My clever girl. FOR MOTHER Who are you looking for, miss? Isn't Mr. Orhan here? Don't you recognize me? You're that lady from the other day, that's right. Mr. Orhan isn't here. He left this letter for you. Fatma, certain familial obligations have made it impossible for us to get married. We are young, and we didn't know any better, but if we go our separate ways, we won't make such mistakes again. Don't cry, mother. She'll turn up somewhere. Maybe she'll get married. Don't be upset. Where's the letter? By the time you read this letter, I'll be far away, with the man I love. It's my right to be happy, as much as it is yours. This is how I've found happiness. Forgive me. My heart will always be with you. We'll find her, wherever she is. It's a matter of honor. No matter where she hides. I warned you and you didn't listen! If you find her, bring her to me. I'll dole out her punishment myself. Why was your front door open? Good evening. Mr. Tahir, when are you leaving the house? I've found some new tenants. -I'll show you! -May your house fall apart! We have enough on our plate! What are you doing! You mongrels, get out of my house! You haven't paid rent in months! Get out, or I'll make you! Get lost! Where's Fatma! How would I know! You got her into this mess. I didn't do anything! Go ask Orhan! Where's that prick! Talk, you whore! Employment Agency - Foreign Affairs We kept looking for Fatma, but couldn't find her. It was as if Istanbul had swallowed her up. Murat disappeared again. Selim, on the other hand, went to an employment agency and applied for work in Germany. Ayla spoke to her parents about me, they were interested. They asked me over, one day. I felt very welcome there. They were a well-to-do family. Her father, Mr. Saim, was a history buff. When he heard that I was interested in history myself, he cheered up. These engravings are from the period of Louis the 16th. I bought this set of inkwells during my last trip to Tehran. But, it's Turkish-made. And these verses are a 200 hundred year old part of our history. -Who's that in the picture? -I told you about my brother in the USA. -That's him. -He settled down there. He got married to a nice American girl. He writes to us, he's doing really well over there. Won't he come back? I don't think so, son. And what about you? Ayla told me you have siblings. What do they do? One of them is a driver. The eldest is a mechanic. But, he's planning to go to Germany. -He's handed in his application. -And your sister? We didn't appreciate her enough. She's left us. I had another sister, our youngest. Had she lived, she'd be 2 years younger than Fatma now. Why'd she die? We lived in a village near Maras, back then. She suddenly got sick one night. We looked for a doctor, to no avail. She passed away in the morning. Why'd you migrate from Maras to Istanbul? For a better way of life, I guess. You're right about that. We're a passionate race. We don't sit still in one place for long, this has been our quality since our times in Central Asia. Or perhaps it's our passion for conquest. It was that passion that drove our ancestors from Central Asia to Anatolia, and then, to Europe. To bring civilization! Father, don't start with the history lessons. It's not just about history Ayla, this is a contemporary issue. Look at today's newspaper. First page, an article about the immigrants coming to Istanbul. There, "238.000 people have migrated to Istanbul in the last 5 years". Third page, an article about workers leaving for Germany. Their dream: to buy a car over there, come back and sell it, and buy themselves an apartment flat. Fifth page. This one's about the Turkish doctors in America. Their reasons for leaving are similar to why people migrate to the cities. Not at all! It's wrong to look at it that way. I think, all those young people represent our might in those foreign lands. Ayla will head over to America after she graduates, too, like her brother. It has nothing to do with unemployment! Why don't you talk, Kemal? You hadn't told me about your plans for going to America. It didn't come up, that's why. What's happened to you? I don't understand. I love you, but I know that it's hopeless. Why? We come from different walks of life. Where do you get these ideas? Will you marry me? Don't you think we should wait until we graduate first? We'll wait. And after marriage, we can go to America. What's wrong now? What's bad about going to America? It would be great to go and see, but we have obligations here, we can't stay there. You're right. We'll do as you wish. As long as we're together, I don't care. Life in Istanbul turned out to be quite different than what we imagined. We thought everything we touched would turn to gold, with no effort. To live a better life, in comfort... Everyone should have that right. That's right. But to deserve that, you have to work, be productive. Those people living over there, who knows where they came from. Would it have been better if they never left their poor, little village? When people stop going at each other's throats, and learn to live together, the world itself will become one big city. But for now, we have to tend to our own little home. I agree. I wish someone had a solution for this. I've waited for you all night! Whose arms were you in! Answer me! I don't have to answer to you! Is that right? You won't go to the club anymore! You won't leave this house! You're being ridiculous. You can't make love on an empty stomach. Stop acting like you don't know that. I'm not your wife. Which fool would marry you? There are plenty of those fools, if I want them. Look at me. Stop the tough guy act, save it for your sister, if you can find her. What are you talking about! Tell me what you know, or else! I told you to drop the act. I've been keeping you in my house as a guest. And you act like you're my boss. Such nonsense. You're not welcome here anymore. Get out! You little... Don't do it, Murat! Please, don't! I beg you! I beg you, Murat! I take it all back! Don't do it! Our family's situation kept getting worse. The taxi was at last sold to a junkyard. Our engagement with Ayla was the only happy occasion during these sorrowful times. It was a modest ceremony, among ourselves. We gave the news to Ayla's family. Mr. Saim believed that I would make a good groom. Hello, mother. This is my fiancee, Ayla. How are you, mother? Thank you, darling. She's so cute. Husband! Look, Kemal has brought his fiancee. -Hello, sir. -Thank you, darling. She's so cute, look at her golden hair. Father, I've brought you a gift. Thank you darling, it was very kind of you. And this is for you, mother. You're so thoughtful. May God always be on your side. A prayer book... She knew that I'm a devout person. Good for you, Kemal. Good for you, son! You didn't turn out like your siblings. We got engaged among ourselves, without telling anyone. I hope you'll forgive us. Kemal insisted for it to be that way. Wasn't that better? As long as you're happy, it doesn't matter darling. Fatma, my dear daughter... I would've wanted to marry you off as well. Don't be sad, mother. Perhaps she's happily married, somewhere. Happiness is all that counts. Well said, darling. My clever girl! You see, Hatice, God took our daughter away, but gave us another one! Thank God... Selim, come in. Come meet your brother's fiancee. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -You like her? -I hope they're happy. Kemal, where's your other brother, the one that gave us a ride in his taxi. Yes, Murat. It's hard to say where he might be. Who knows where he is this time. Hello sweetie, did I keep you waiting? No, I just arrived. -May I use the phone? -Sure. Thank you for everything, mother. Please, let me get that. Ayla, let's not be late. Alright. With your permission, father... Please, of course... Please, don't get up. Selim! Murat is waiting for you on the phone. Hurry up. I'd like to say hello to Murat as well. Hello? Is that you, Murat? What? Did you say Fatma? Where? I understand. I'm on my way. What did he say? Nothing important. -What's happened to Fatma? -I said it's nothing! We have to solve this with Murat. -Something's up, Kemal. -You're right. Which door is it? You check that side, I'll go here. What do you want? We're looking for Ms. Seval. There's no one here by that name here. But, she was just here. I said there's no one here! Brother, they're here! Murat! I've got you at last! They're climbing the fire exit, Kemal! Stop! -Don't do something crazy! -Please, don't! You slut, I've got you now. There's nowhere to run, you can't hide. What're you doing, Fatma, are you crazy! Stay back! Get down from there! Stop, Murat, don't go! Don't go! You killed her! You killed her! Stop it, brother! I beg you, stop! My daughter... Did we come all this way to Istanbul just to bury you? My daughter... Why did you have to go before your mother and father? Your hair... My poor daughter... How you liked to play with your hair in front of the mirror. You'd curl it, twirl it, and braid it... And now your body lies under the cold, black earth. My daughter. That's enough. I beg you, stop crying. You're killing us, together with yourself. Don't tell me to stop. Let me cry my heart out. Let me cry myself to death. What's the point in living after this? Then, take me with you. Don't leave me here. Death, cruel death, why did you take her while we're still here? Fatma's death should be a lesson for us. We have to think things over. Coming to Istanbul from Maras, with our dreams of conquering this city, was our first mistake. We're a family of limited means, we should've held on to what we had. Instead, we've been greedy. And, instead of working together, everyone went their separate ways. We've contributed nothing to this city, and yet we've tried to exploit it's bounty. That's why we've failed. What shall we do now? I think our only option is to sell everything, and go back to Maras. And, start over. What would we do over there? We could open a new workshop and run it efficiently. But, all that would require money. Don't worry about that, father. I'll provide you the funding, as a long term debt. I've talked it over with my father. Is that right? Is your father really willing to help us out? Thank you, God bless you! Come here kids! Come! Let's talk it through, what we're going to do. -We can go back to Maras, but not to our old neighborhood. -No way! We'll set up shop in someplace else. Father will work in the office, and Selim will man the workshop itself. I'll take care of our business in the city. We'll work, and make our payments each month! And after we've paid back our debt, we can grow our business! Think of this not as a defeat, but as the start of a new life. After we graduate, we'll come to Maras as well. Young, educated people like us are needed there, more than here. We realize that. Gramps, where are you off to? Have you finally given up? We've given up, rascal. And how about you? What kind of question is that? I'm a man for all seasons! No matter if it's rain or snow, I'll find a way to line my pockets. Then your coronation must be close at hand. Listen, I've already become the proprietor of a shantytown here. Now, I'm going to Kayseri, I'll be running an agency for immigrants coming here. And when I come back, I'll start the construction of a new apartment. If you're looking for a place to stay, come find me. As I've told you before, Mr. Driver, if you're not ready to seize an opportunity, someone else will grab it! If you're not cunning, if you don't keep your eyes open, you'll starve! So long, I'll see you on the train. I hope there's no bad blood between us. You're my brother, after all. Prepare a place for us, we'll come visit during the holiday! ...The south-eastern express train has arrived in Section 1... Look at this city, the city of plenty. God willing, we will be like kings in this city. Kings! The End
