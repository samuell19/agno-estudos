Have you ever found money in old laundry? A crumpled and shrunken 100 or 500 rupee note? You'd be ecstatic if you stumbled upon it, right? When all are eating 'pongal' has your serving got the most cashews? When such things happen, it tells you God is happy. But, what if, in the same 'pongal', all the peppers you dislike came your way? It'd rain all night, raising hope that school or college will be closed. But when it stops raining at exactly 7 AM, we'd be crushed, right? When waiting in a queue, the one next to ours seems to move faster. Has this happened to you? They always happen to me! When such things happen, it means God is angry with us. If God can get angry at our petty lapses, why doesn t he lash out at those sinners? That too, when they sin in his name? Don't get it, right? Twenty thousand crore rupees. The earnings of a 'holy' charlatan of our land, from last year alone. How many such sharks live in the world? How much wealth they amass in the name of God? Why does God not get angry at them? One such fraudster here at beautiful Vellimallai, Nagercoil... ...is about to swindle 11,000 acres of land from the locals. You know how huge that is? Equals 43 kilometres. 118 villages. 600 ponds. Three huge lakes. 150,000 people depend on the land. We've covered this fraudster and his plans for the past six years. No one batted an eye. No action was taken. Never mind others. Across these 11,000 acres, there are 50 temples with 50 deities. Is not even one of them angry about this? "When not even one among fifty deities hit back, do we even need them?" That is what the people ask. For Nanjil News, this is Engels Ramasamy! Stopped rolling? O Dear God! Please forgive me, dear God! I didn't mean to speak blasphemy! I had the gall to question why you even exist! Please don't punish me for this! Here on in, all must be well! Please save everyone, dear God! Move it, everyone! Hurry! We're late! -I'm not coming, mom! I'm shy! Don't be shy! Come on! They'll be waiting for us! My feet is burning! Move fast, everyone! -My feet burns! Come on! Let's go! Thinking we'd be late... ...we rushed as fast as we could! Who is he? -Astrologer Thalamuthu from Nallur. Our family astrologer. We don't believe in astrology. Let's go then, mom. -Wait... Don't be hasty! Planets, astronomy, astrology, nameology, numerology... All these sciences... They originated in our town! I follow astrology for everything! We went to the bank today and took out all the jewels from the locker. I didn't wear them as he said it was 'jewel-o-karma'! What is that? Well... Why must we bother finding out? He tells us what to do, and we oblige. That's it... Locked up the jewelry in the safe? I put them in the loft. -Costly jewels in the loft? She put it in the locker atop the loft! They carelessly leave the jewels lying around! Also, my husband's restaurant business was thriving. Out of the blue, the astrologer said it'd be better if he went abroad. That's why you closed your restaurant? Yeesh! What a strange question to ask! Not closed. Just being renovated. -I see... Yes. Because he only visits us once a year, all these past eleven years! He's just so busy! None of your relatives came? Had I invited them all, there'd be no room left in the Suchindram temple! Around six thousand people! -Six thousand? Respond like that, and you'll jinx us! We're part of Thiruvangur's royal line... -He's a reporter with Nanjil TV, right? Yes. Have you seen him? No, I have not. Are you familiar with reporter Pandey? No, I don't... He knows him very well! The man consults my son thrice a day, like one does with a doctor! It seems he plans to start a party. Well... -Not a party... What party? -On TV. A TV party! Spilled the beans before I could! For it, he consults with my son on hiring show anchors, slating shows... ...and fixing up who gets to sing and dance. He beckons my boy to come to Chennai, to serve as the manager. I refused, as I didn't want to uproot my son and our family over there. The guy burst into tears! -It's getting late! Call the bride. Yes, please call her. Saved by the bell! The girl's in the backyard. She wants to see him alone. Please send the boy to her and let them chat privately. I'll ask for his permission. Will you go and talk to her, dear boy? Don't blush, my precious! He's so coy! Go ahead, my boy! What do your daughters do? She's with the IAS. In coaching, that is. She's a pilot! -What? Under training, I mean. And she's doing Medicine. Prepping for the NEET exam. -Got it! Wow, is he sharp! What a brilliant man! That'll do, mom! I'm sorry. Didn't notice you had earphones on. You look even more beautiful in person than in the picture. Looking at your photo, I thought you were balding. Not bad. Still intact. I had oiled up my hair for the photo, that must've flattened it a bit. Okay... what's with the name 'Engels Ramasamy'? My grandfather named me so. 'Engels', friend of Communist leader Karl Marx, combined with 'Ramasamy'... Where's your office? -I don't have one! I'm a reporter. My friend mans the camera. Our office, is wherever the news is. I work with BSNL. Did they tell you? -Yes. Is your job a permanent one? -I'm on a story now. Been covering it for the last six years. If it gets huge, I get legit and may get offers from Chennai. I've already gotten two to three offers. Can't leave my family, right? True. That too with your father in Saudi, yes? No. He abandoned us. As my mother is ashamed to admit it, she uses Saudi as a cover. Since dad took off, my grandfather hasn't left the house. So we closed down the hotel. Mom covers up and calls it 'renovation'. And I've been running the family for the past eleven years. We're under debt, too. If our match proceeds, you'll find out all this soon anyway. It shouldn't blindside you. So I'm telling you up front. Those three girls your sisters? -Yes. Deivamirtham. Devamirtham. Vendamirtham. Why 'Vendamirtham'? Even if it's nectar, we didn't want more. So we forced our mom to name her that. How many years are you two apart? What? That little girl is your sister? Is that your father's full time job? Are there only four kids, or are the more hidden away at home? Could've had another! Like the five elements! Mom! I asked how much older than her are you. Sixteen. Good thing your father took off. Else you would've ended up with four more sisters! If I were to be impressed by your honesty and agree to the match... ...we'd be happy for two days, tops. But what if I end up regretting this choice my entire life? Afraid to even think about it. Please don't take it the wrong way. You're the twelfth prospective bride I've met. Very practical. I understand. Thank You. Goodbye. (She sings along with the radio) Will you stop that? You are so full of lies! Would they agree to the match if I knew Pandey? Still playing the Saudi card! When dad isn't at the wedding, what then? He couldn't get time off at Saudi... Pathological liar! Know what that girl asked? If we have a new release at home every three years. Like old Rajni films! Tell her it won't happen anymore. Dad's not here... Act your age, mom! You went high and noble and ruined it! So she rejected you! Shut up, mom! Lies make marriages happen! Not families! Stop looking for a bride for me! It's humiliating! Everyone's laughing that I'd be married before my sisters! To hell with them! What did the astrologer say? "Before the goddess leaves the house, another goddess must come in." Do you treat her like a goddess? Stop it! Why are you making this about me? You reject every prospect and still continue looking! Stop at Ganapathi Stores! I need to buy batter! Hey! His entire life is a question mark at this point! Have you no sense? We'll see who has what when you come to dinner at eight! Alright! Make it fast! I want tomato sauce for the rice crepes. I've repeatedly told you this, mom. I'm not a pilot. I am just training to be an air-hostess. They serve snacks and drinks on planes! -Oh shut up! You should've explained it clearly like now! "Nest question is from Paalthangam of Parakkai." My question! -"I tried to go to Tirupati many times..." "...but to no avail, Sire. Please tell me a way to do so, without any hurdles." "It is really easy to go to Tirupati, Paalthangam." "Three trains at the Nagercoil Junction go to Lower Tirupati every week." "Pilgrimage buses there run 24/7. They'll take you to Upper Tirupati." "Remember to buy 'laddoos' on the way!" "Please send me some, too!" You asked for a way, and he gave you directions! Liars don't get to go to Tirupati! No Tirupati for you! -Quit laughing! Quiet! What is it? -Come in, father-in-law. It was hilarious! What happened? -Same as usual, grandpa. You bought batter? I've ground the chutney. Take it. What can I do if you stopped with one child? Hold on, everyone! So much bad luck! "That's your daughter? She's so young! And such an older son!" And I get asked how I look so young despite being a mother of four! From now, you're my brother! You're my sister! You two are now my siblings! Only these two are my kids! Or it's all bad luck! Lunatic! Look at that face! What happened, Thangam? The girl didn't shine enough as she stood next to Engels, Rani! So he rejected her! I'll kill you! Beat it, blockhead! We have everything we need to reopen the restaurant, right? We need dad back, right? Only then will grandpa reopen it. Did they ask why it was closed? Mom said dad's in Saudi and the restaurant's being renovated. Want some rice crepes, Deva? I asked you a question, Deva! Good grief! When must her fees be paid? -I'll check and let you know. You got no sense? Always fixated on TV! Even this young kid can serve herself! -Move! Arrogant wretch! Got no sense, you wastrel? What am I watching? And what are you doing? I'm watching the news which pertains to my job, you idiot! Isn't she watching TV for educational reasons? Why did you turn it off? Don't be stupid! Do you have no conscience, mom? She's insulting her over her lack of education! After making her quit studying to slave away, you insult her so? Apologize to her! Why must I apologize? What was wrong with what I said? Expect us to be quiet as you shoot your mouth off? Apologize! Why stick your nose in this? Don't fling the plate! Pick it up! Sure, scold me! But not her! I didn't do this on purpose. I thought you were slouching off. I even washed your uniform once we got back! Oh no! My uniform! Who asked you to wash it? So damn wet! How do I go to class tomorrow? I told grandpa not to wash it! It'll dry by dawn. Some house this is! Just three more months and I'll be gone! Be well, all of you! Did I have four kids so they could abandon me? Don't ever say you'll leave the house. Been enough of that already. I wouldn't have to listen to this crap if your father was here. All of you listen up! If we all make a trip to Tirupati, our problems will go away... "Mission Tirupati". Hurry up! Shall we go? -Yes. Just a minute. Hey, Rani! We're going to Tirupati! Get me some 'laddoos', Thangam! -Sure! Collect our milk packets. I... "Mission Tirupati 2." Here you go. Careful... -Come... Shall I close the door? We're going to Tirupati, Rani! Buy me some 'laddoos', Thangam! I will! Start driving, Mr. Ram. Hold on. The cops are flagging us down. What's wrong, sir? You can't go further! Mr. Chiranjeevi has started a party nearby! No permission! Turn back! Chiranjeevi's shooting a film here! Not a film shoot! A meeting with a million people! Get going! -Just a minute, sir! All is lost! -Get going! Stop that car! "Mission Tirupati 3". We're on our way, O God! So many thousand rupee notes! You're awesome, mom! Skimped and saved so much! -Don't fold them! A thousand rupees! This note is torn, mom. Is it valid? It sure will be. Rani! I'm going to... Now none of this will be valid, right? "Mission Tirupati 4". Let's just go once... We'll go when God calls for us, mom! Alright! He'll call us! We'll go then! Excuse me! Won't you do anything? Put on a show like you're blessing us, eh? Heard a word I said? How's that possible? Ears stuffed with jewelry, right? Look at that stare! Too sure I won't do anything, right? In a second, I can remove your picture and replace it with Sai Baba's! Who else do I turn to? Please help me. Good night. Should I wear a chudidhar? Rani wears it. Can I wear one, too? -Buzz off, mom! Forget chudidhars! I'll buy you jeans! Show me your forehead. What is it? Milk? O God! Mom? -What? Turn your head towards me. -Sure, dear. Lean on! Turn towards me and sleep, mom! -I'm coming! Don't turn away, mom! How about this? I'll remain like so. You each get to see half my face. What a huge demand for my face! My dears? Can I wear a chudidhar from now? Wait for two more years. Then do so. You tell me, dear. Should I wear one? I'm asleep! I'm aware! You're all jealous! If I wear a chudidhar, you're all done for! Beyond this room, there's no one for us in this world, right? 'O dear God Almighty! Everything's alrighty!' 'Would it be too bad if from you, a wish we had?' 'Besides you, there is not a soul, to take us on a stroll!' 'To my call, you are my only all!' 'Help sort us our wrong and take us along!' 'This boon is all we ask, O God!' 'Yesterday faded away as a whisper in the wind.' 'A whisper in the wind.' 'Yesterday faded away as a whisper in the wind.' 'A brand new day is born as a fragrant whiff in the wind!' 'Our days, we left to fate!'  And yet, in a corner, the heart had faith! 'Something greater than you stands before.' 'It shall walk beside and take you ashore.' Hello. -Get going! Where's the mark on your forehead? Nothing. Go. Sister! What? -Not you! The nun! Good morning, Sister. I'm her brother. -I know. How is she doing in class? All good. She is really studious! That I know. Can you come closer? Can't move forward. Tell me. Her activities as of late make me nervous, Sister. She secretly does the sign of the cross before sleeping. She utters a prayer before we have a meal. She doesn't mark her forehead. Big trouble if my mom finds out. We are orthodox Hindus! What are you saying? How can the school be responsible? -I did not mean it like that... 1,300 students study here every year. Do they all change religion? Didn't you study here, too? Did you convert? We do not choose the Lord. Only He chooses us. Sophie is a God chosen child. Sophie? Her name is Vendam! Sorry. I meant Vendamirtham. Sure know how to name kids, don't you? Sophie! She didn't respond to that name! This is my wife, sir! I know, man! Hey! She is my wife! I said I know! A wedding photoshoot works like this! Must I not coach you? What do I do? -Now do as I say! Give her a romantic look, like I did! Do it properly or I'll have to teach you! He's doing it correctly! Do it properly. Smile like me! Ask her how it's done! Wow, what a shot! That's it! Seen 'Titanic'? Hold her tight! -Let go! I'll do it! Like that! Excellent! (He sings a random song) Do it properly! I need one more take! What the hell are you doing? Come on! Go Spitsville! Excellent! Say 'Cheese!' What? -Come on! Get into your swimming attire. I'll be back! No! That's enough of this photoshoot! Come along! Are they peeved? -Yes. You intruded, didn't you? Where to? -Vellimalai! We keep shuffling between Vellimalai and the Collector's office! Is there no other story to cover? -11,000 acres of our people's land! We can't just abandon it! They're giving it to a charlatan! Locals saw those ashram members come survey the place. As usual, the Collector took no action. It's up to us to fix it! "Mookuthi Amman is with us!" When I say 'fear', proceed. -Got it. When he says 'fear', come into the shot. -Okay! 11,000 acres in Vellimalai at Nagercoil... Hold on! We're not rolling yet! 11,000 acres of land in Vellimalai at Nagercoil... To create a fisheries research plant... Can't you go this way? -You go that way! Nagercoil... Hold on! Go romance over there! What's it to you? -No can do! Want to be part of the 'Crime' TV show? Pan over to them! Shoot them! Beat it! We rolling? -Yes. Go on! At the Vellimalai region of Nagercoil... ...11,000 acres of land were provided thirteen years ago... ...by the locals, for the creation of a fisheries research plant. As this research department has been moved to Kochi... ...this land is unclaimed and lays waste. As of late, due to the rise of cult leaders... ...people fear the land would be usurped by charlatans. Fear... among the people... Fear... What's wrong with him? -Go! The word 'fear' was your cue! Do you feel fearful, sir? -Yes! I'm terrified. It's been eleven years! It's unbearable. Outsiders come and go! And your family? They're scared, right? -My family? They're very scared, indeed! We see a farmer who is in absolute fear. Like him, several thousands of people in Nagercoil are terrified. For Nanjil News, this is Engels Rama... -Your phone's going off! Engels Ramasamy. Do I not know that? This, you point out correctly! Spoke properly to me, right? Confused, aren't you? Yes! -Why make it seem like I coached you? Go! Yes! -Why are you yelling? What's wrong? -Come home right away! Why? -Just come! I'll tell you. Stop! -What happened? You said that day we'll go to Tirupati when God sends for us. He has done so! God? -Yes! Pattupadi Siddhar of Parakkai! I will not speak! Can he not talk? He's mute! -Then why have such a musical name? He went mute after he was named! Your... children... You have one kid? No! Two kids? No! Three kids? No! You have four! Am I right? I'm correct, right? Bang on! Don't nod! That's how he makes his guesses! In your family... You... and your husband... -Yes... You both were of one mind... -One mind... Hale, hearty and happy... Not! Do you get it? I told you to stop nodding, mom! (He rambles incoherently) Do you understand? -No! How can I claim to understand something I don't, mom? He spins that stick, we're done for! Do you get it now? -Yes! We get it, too! We all understand! I get it! -I totally understand! Why is he hitting me? -Each blow is a boon! Give us a solution to our problem! -What? A solution! -A solution? O solution! Don't nod! -The solution is... He's coming to you, knowing you'll spill! Don't move your lips! Your nose is shaking! Control it! Don't say it, mom! It's almost there! Say it! -Don't, mom! Stay quiet! All will be well if we go to Tirupati? Correct! He figured it out! -You moron! He was going to say it, but he let me do so! The divine foreseer! My boy... before this dries up, go to Tirupati! Excellent! -We'll go! Wonderful! Is he a real sage or did you set it up? He's a powerful sage! We'll go on Friday! Today's Wednesday. How can we get tickets this late? Book on Tatkal and take the train! Damn imbecile! Ticket costs, lodging and food altogether costs 30,000 rupees! I got no money! Do you? 'Behold Don Baasha!' 'Dig that mighty swagger!' 'Behold his mighty army!' 'He is one sharply dressed tiger!' 'His eyes burn like wildfire!' 'Of blood and sweat, he is the emperor of this kingdom!' 'For it is a fact that his name is all consuming!' When is the train? -5:30! We still have time, mom! Alright. Packed those rice cakes? How would I know? Ask her! -Yes, mom! All done! Sure! Don't learn to cook! Call her. -Who? Your sister! -Like she has a phone! Why does he always lash out? It's getting late! You're home, sweety! Go and get dressed! What brings you here... What's wrong, sis? Your daughter has come of age. What? -Your daughter has come of age! Hold me! -Mom! Hold me! We can't get a refund on these tickets, right? We hoped to make it to Tirupati at least this time. And this had to happen! Don't feel bad about it. Go spend a night at the temple of your family deity. All will be well. Nothing good happens until the family deity wishes so. That is why your Tirupati trip never works out! Who is your family deity? God Pechi Nachiamma. That is from your side. Your husband's family deity is yours now. You often go to many temples. Don't you know your husband's family deity? I went once after my wedding. Been 30 years. Alright, hold on. Father-in-law! Who is our family deity? -Mookuthi Amman of Vellimalai! Already short on money. If I bring this up, my son will chew me out! Mom? We'll go. 'A glimpse of you through my soul!' 'The form unseen by any other!' 'I had seen you as a mere stone!' 'You showed me your true self and filled my mind to the brim!' 'Where were you hiding? Why did you vanish?' 'I searched for you far and wide, only to find you within!' 'This is all I need. No more boons, I shall seek!' 'Is this bliss, O dear God?' 'I feel you in my soul!' 'I am lost in ecstasy!' 'You are my heart! You are my world!' 'You are the breadth of the universe!' 'You are the heartbeat of an ant and the heaviness of an elephant s trunk!' 'A queen with a thousand hands! Can you not lend one to help?' 'You watch with a billion eyes! Can even one, not melt at my plight?' 'I surrendered to you, my only haven!' I can't anymore. I'm drained. It has been eleven years. Why did my father abandon us? Why did my mother trust such a jerk and have so many kids? I do take good care of them. But at times, I don't know what to do. I'm scared. Wish I had an older sibling... Why do I have three younger sisters? Why didn't Deiva study? Why does no woman like me? I have so many questions. But I don't know who to ask. When the world has so many problems... ...mine might seem trivial to you, right? But I am an ordinary man. My mother, sisters and grandfather are my whole world. Their happiness is everything to me. For their well-being, someone told me to shave my head. And I did. I pierced myself all over. I walked on burning embers. "Go to these temples and do these rituals", they said. I did them all. I don't know what more to do. All of a sudden, you are every place I look! It felt like you are trying to tell me something. That old lady said the family deity is angry. I don't know what we did to upset you. But if I... ...or my family has done something wrong... ...please forgive us. Please help us. I don't know who else to turn to. You are our family deity. Please help. Mom! Hey, Deva! I'm so scared! Wake up, mom! Someone's here! A sage of some kind! Who are you? I am Amman. Mookuthi Amman! Your family deity. You tearfully prayed to me earlier today. It made me feel pity. That is why I am here. You're lying! Who are you? I don't believe this! What must I do to make you believe? Shall I make it rain? It didn't rain! No rain! Where is it? You're just joking! All fake! It's cold! So very cold! It's raining! Alright! That's enough! An old broken down temple. That's why water seeps in from the top! I already saw gale winds, thunder and lightning tonight. I don't believe this! Think of something. I'll figure it out. Oh, that game? 'Grandmaster'? I'll play! You got it! Yeesh! You thought of that song at this hour? Think you can get me to spill my answer like this? You won't! I didn't think about this song at all! This technique was used by Dr. Bohra in the film 'Robot'. So what do you want me to do? What do you want? Ask away! Will you give me a boon now? God appears before me to fulfil a wish of mine? God has come to grant me a boon? Ask me. Our broken down house should turn into a palace! With a swimming pool, fountain and a huge car! A watchman in the outhouse to safeguard it! The palace must have all high end appliances! My mother and sisters must be adorned with jewelry. We must be multi-generation millionaires! All must believe it! We must be happy! You said you didn't believe me! Thought I was part of a TV show. And you ask for so much? I've seen many films since childhood. Anytime one meets a God or spirit... ...their first wishes are stupid. A kite to land on your lap. A woman to ask you for the time. A sweet. That is why anytime I were to encounter a god or a spirit... ...I wanted to be prepared and had a list ready since I was nine! At such a young age? Oh God! So that wasn't a dream? Hello, ma'am! How are you? -Hello, Shankardas. How are you? I'm doing well, ma'am. -Lovely. Whose house is this? -Ours! Ours? And you're speaking Hindi? -He's Nepali! Nepali? Wow! -Yes! Greetings! -Thank You! Whose name is written there? -The owner's name! Owner's name? -Our name! We're the owner? Wow! Hold up! Whose car is this? -Ours. This and that one! Both cars are ours? -Yes, buddy! Can I touch it? -Why not? So smooth! -Scratch it, too! No one'll complain! Is this really our car, mom? -Yes, dear! And you are? -I'm your neighbor. Shiva from Belgium. Our neighbor? He even wears a suit at home! Awesome! Tell me! I asked for one lakh yesterday. As you had no change, you gave five lakhs. I came to pay it back! -I forgot! I gave you four extra lakhs? It's okay! Keep the change! Thank You, God! -What are you doing? What is this, mom? You're wearing a chudidhar and so much jewelry! Like a Lalitha Jewelry model! -I always wear chudidhars! Is this our house, mom? -Yes! It's just like in the film 'Padayappa'! Stairways inside the house! Look at this! What is this, mom? -A carpet. I'll lie down and roll around on it! It is meant to be spread out! Not to be rolled upon! Who is this? -That's Deiva! That's Deiva? What are you watching? "Game of Thrones!" You speak English? -Yes, of course! How do you know English? I knew it yesterday. As I do today. And will do tomorrow. With a guard and a manager! She's all educated! Look at your second sister! -What happened to her? Why are you dressed like an ATM guard? Where are you going? I'm going to fly! It's time! Nagercoil has no airport! What era are you in? Teach him something, mom! She became a pilot, mom! How many fans and lights in here? We have it all! We're multi-generation millionaires! Is that so? -Yes! Where's Grandpa? He's bathing in the pool! We have a swimming pool? -Yes! Where? -The first or second floor! Swimming pool on the second floor! Take the elevator! 'You did not see the girl I saw!' I forgot about his restaurant! What is this? A bike! A magic bike! What bike is it? What brand? A Pulsar? A 'Horlicks-Davidson'? Where's the kick-starter? The key is here! Got it! 2012! Engine Start! How do I put it in neutral? O God... Amman! How could I ever doubt your might? O dear God! I visited every temple in town! No one helped! I asked you to help a little. And you do this? We're the fourth richest family in Nagercoil! Thanks! Had I met you ten years ago, I'd have mashed up Mukesh Ambani! I got everything, dear God! Thank you so much! But I forgot one last thing! Reopening my grandfather's restaurant! Got left out! Where are you, O God? Where are you, Amman? Talk to me! You'd show up only if I prayed in sorrow? Must I do so? It's been eleven years. My father... Oh my... I can't just sound sad in these clothes and shades! What must I do to make you come? I got it! What an idea! 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'How many people would this upset?' 'For me and you...' My idea worked! The code word! I see Amman atop the horse! These horses seem straight out of the 'Mahabharatha' TV show. O Amman! Amman! Thank You, dear God! Are you content? Very much so! Now do you believe me? Indeed, I do! But I forgot one thing last night! My grandpa's restaurant is closed. If you could just re-open it... Is that all? I have two cars at home. Two of my sisters will take them away when they marry. What will my third sister do? If I get married, how would I move around? If you just gave us two more cars, great! Next? -Oh my... If I knew this offer would have no end, I'd have made a list! Can you give me some time? I'll prepare a list! Just a minute ago, you said you were content. A second later, you need so much, right? You won t even let slip the word  enough by mistake, huh? Did you show up now to get to me admit that? You want to see why I came? Where do I see? The sky? A huge screen up there? Wow! I can see it in these glasses! How many times will you stop us from going to Tirupati? We've all come and met you, right? Just give us your nod! That's why we came! I see it! What did you see? Why is your face getting all red? It's getting very windy! What did you see? No jewels... The poor mother I have always known! How dare your mother tell me she came here because she wants to go to Tirupati? If he's a God, then what am I? It burns! Please retract it! You are God! You are The God! The innocent kid didn't know what she was saying! A kid, is she? Yes, she's my mother! Poor, poor thing! Please forgive me! Retract the trident! I'm sorry, dear God! Please forgive me! I didn't mean to do this! Her anger is gone! She's not red anymore! Now listen good! My temple should become as revered as the one in Tirupati! I must become as famous as that deity! Worldwide! I must be visited by a million people every day! All of this must happen by the upcoming month of 'Aadi'. You must make it happen! Me? Why must I? There's only 48 days left for that day! You are God! You can do anything, right? You do it yourself! Call a crowd, they'll come! Ask for a festival, it'll happen! Chariots will show up! Do it yourself! We are Gods because we help others. We must not selfishly serve our own interests! Those are our rules! Rules, huh? But why must I do it? Because you are a God chosen child. Me? I'm a God chosen child? This temple is in the middle of nowhere. You expect me, all alone, to make it world famous? Yes! Like Tirupati! Yes, like Tirupati. Code word! What will you do amid all this? -I will be alongside you! Suppose I do not like this offer? If I refuse and walk away? No, I'm scared! Just come here! A divine secret? My head will explode if I reveal it? I'll do it. I accept the offer. Like I have a choice! But I have one wish. Will you fulfill it? Can we fly out of here? Spirits tend to travel by air. Can you fly me home? You don't have to hold me like this. I might slip! This way, I'll be upright and balanced! Can we fly home? Why are we riding the bus? You gleefully agreed to fly us there! For this jacket, I'll let it go. The people here are very happy. O God, where are you going? Give me your hand! God issues tickets to heaven, but now you get to do so! Two for Parakkai. Two? -Yes. One for me and one for God. Who for, the second ticket? -For God! Is that so? Two tickets bought! He's crazy! I have a doubt. Like in the movies, can no one else see you? So was I the only one who saw you nod just now? They laugh as they think I'm crazy? Want to see how I salvage this? Sit here, sir! -No thanks, my boy. It's okay! There's room! No wait! We're about to get off! Sit, then! I ensured the next seat's empty! -Stop! Stop! We get off here! Hold on! She hasn't gotten off yet! Come along! Wait! Yes, come down! This is our stop! Parakkai! Come! Such a mighty God you are! And you don't know my stop? Why isn't your hair black, but auburn like a foreign God? With all the contaminated water in rituals? There you go! I don't want the Nepali guard? -Why? You used your power to create him. But how do we pay his monthly salary? No need! Where is my palatial home? Where is my car? My BMW car? Where is my car? "Your car?" Is this a fountain? -What's wrong? Where is the water fountain? -What are you saying? Come here, mom! What's wrong, son? -My bike! Is this my bike? This isn't my bike! -Then whose is it? Crazy fellow! What happened to you? -What are you wearing? Weren't you wearing pricey jewelry and chudidhars? Me? -Yes. Where is all of it? Where are the chudidhars? Tell me, mom! Where is the jewelry? (incoherent words) Oh man! You're a millionaire's neighbor? A millionaire's neighbor! -My son's gone crazy! Where's my fridge? -Come fast, Rani! Is this the sofa set? When have we ever had a sofa? Cool down, my son! Why is the house filled with coconuts? -In your father's memory! Put that down, dear. What glasses am I wearing, mom? What? -This is sun glass, right? No, it is your usual seeing glass. And the jacket I was wearing? Right here! Not that jacket! I had cut-off jeans! -I'll stitch them tonight, son! Thinks she's 'Elizabeth Taylor'! She'll stitch it, she says! -Now what? What happened? -What is she watching? She's watching a Tamil soap opera. 'Wedding Manor'. What about 'Game of Thrones'? Take the flank anytime he charges towards you! Grandpa! Where's grandpa? The swimming pool! Grandpa... The swimming pool? You dare call me a fool? I said 'pool', grandpa. An English word. The Sony fridge... The magic bike... -He's coming! All be quiet! Dear boy... -Careful, mom... Sit down. -Mom... He watched the film 'Kanchana' last night on TV, right? It spooked him! Right, my boy? Who is there? Why is everything gone? What is gone? When you didn't believe, it came. When you believed, it vanished! Who is he talking to? Do you see anyone? I didn't believe, and I got everything. But once I did, I lost it all? What has happened to him? -He's talking to himself, mom! What if I did not believe, and did not turn up at the temple again? You'd still have it all! You're bluffing, right? Just a lie? I swear you'd still have it. What happened? All your fault! Why the hell do you need a restaurant? What did I do? Why chase me? That's the neighbor's pot! Give it! Rani will scold me! O dear God! What happened to this boy? Aren't you the only God for this family? We rely on you! Do not forsake us so! Look at the many pictures of deities! Why is yours alone front and centre and huge? Because you are my only God. Didn't I make an arduous trip to that forest temple just so I could see you? Why else would I have gone there? -Mom! Of all the Gods in the world, you are the only one who saves us! For you are our only God! You are the all-powerful God! You and you alone! I don't want any wealth! Please do not hurt my mother! Why are your eyes splitting? Please spare my mother! I only have one mother! She may be crazy, but she is my mother to the end! I'll make your temple as famous as Tirupati, like you wish! I'll get started on it right away! People of Nagercoil! You may have visited many temples! But you have seen only idols there! Have your ever seen God? I have! I only prayed for four minutes! She appeared and granted bucketloads of boons! Come to Vellimalai Mookuthi Amman temple, and make your troubles vanish! God Amman will appear and grant what you want... Do you have problems with your husband? Come to Mookuthi Amman temple right away! Do you have problems with your wife? You too can come to Mookuthi Amman temple! Trouble with the police? Come to Mookuthi Amman temple... Police having trouble? You too can come to Mookuthi Amman temple! Ten thousand rupees in all! I'll kill you! Get more! They clamor about seeking God to save them! The God who saves them is seated right here! Not one person came! We need another plan. Forget it! What are you thinking? You think they all pray out of faith? They pray out of fear! They fear more about their misdeeds going public, than committing them! Been ages since devotion was driven by faith rather than fear. Had you said there's a ghost in a house, at least ten people would come see it. You said there's God in a temple. Did a single person come? Don't rush to conclusions in just a day! Go look how every temple is crowded with devotees! More families are believers than non-believers. Alright then. You work in the media, right? Go find out why people go to temples. Why do you go to the temple? To pray to God! What else? My family thinks I'm a good girl only if I go to the temple! To joyfully ride the giant wheel! To pray to God! -Bangles are available for cheap there! To get married again! I get paid a lot more here! I go if any miracle happened! I go to check out the girls there! -I go to see God! To pray my daughter gets married! To seek God's grace! -As it's quiet there, I go to sleep! It costs to go anywhere else! Why do you go to the temple? You don't go? I try to, but I have no time! Now do you realize why people go to temples? Half of them go out of faith. The rest come for the temple offerings. Guys come to ogle at girls. Kids come for the elephants. If a miracle happens, the entire town comes to the temple. Exactly! We must bring that stunning miracle to my temple! You won't do anything or use your powers! How will the miracle happen? Why must God use her powers? Did divine power make an idol open its eyes? Or make the statue grow? Or make bitter fruit sweet? Or Lord Vinayagar drink milk? You folks made it happen, right? We must do such a thing! I don't get it! What must we do? Magic! In Vellimalai Mookuthi Amman temple at Nagercoil... ...we have witnessed the miracle of milk flowing incessantly... ...from a snake mound, since dawn! We have witnessed devotees from the Nagercoil region coming in droves! Not just them, but devotees worldwide have been floored by this miracle! Come here, sir! How did this happen? This isn't ordinary milk coming from the soil! Everyone says this is milk from the soul of Goddess Parvathi! Would drinking it cure you of all disease? Absolutely! Milk seems to be coming from a snake mound. Shall we go see? In due time. It'll be crowded now. This is a miracle! Lasts only 48 days! We must see it right now! I will enjoy the iftar meal! I will relish the communion bread! But I will never ever drink the Aadi porridge of the Hindus! He doesn't believe in God, and that's fine. But he who props up one God but puts down another? He's dangerous. Wondered if folks would come to pray here? See how plenty have turned up in ernest! But is all of this right? What did you say that day? If a stunning miracle happened, people would come here in droves. Can you believe this? -No... But a crowd turned up, right? As far as they're concerned, this is all that God is. That is devotion! Much milk is being wasted, right? I made temple offerings from the wasted milk. How is it? This is pretty good... ...but it is missing something. No other options, I'm afraid. If you want a better offering, we need people from out of town. What is that? That is milk 'pongal'. My sister made it. Give me some! -It's nothing fit for you! It's fine! Give me some! Please do not hex me if it is not to your liking. Delicious! This was made from milk too, right? Let this be the offering! This was made for us to have at home! It's alright. This is good. Deiva made this. She cooks everything really well! Have you ever told her that? No. It's not that big a deal. If it's good, won't you compliment her? If it's good, I gorge it! If it's not, I let her know first! Not just you... No man ever compliments the women at home if they do something well. You only chew them out! Tell her this is good. Sure, I'll tell her later... Go... -I've never done this before. Little shy... Go! Brinjals! They come in green and red, right? You want coffee? -No. You continue. Do we eat so much okra? That's why we're all so smart, huh? It's a joke! Tell her! The milk 'pongal' you made... -What about it? Wasn't good? Want more? Was it not sweet enough? Then why are you bugging me? No, it was delicious! Not just that, but every single thing you make is delicious! For years, you've taken great care of us. Thank you very much! What happened? I've been doing this for years. Why say this now? Go on, ask her if she wants anything! Boons, I mean! If you want anything, ask away now! Go ahead! -What's wrong with you? All's fine! You ask now! I want nothing. What's wrong? -Please ask! She'll ask! Think hard of what you want! Please think hard and ask! We're out of black peppers! Get some! -Not that! Ask for something else! Something you wish for! The battery died on Grandpa's torch! I'll beat you to death! Not this one! Ask for something else! Think long and hard! Something you wished for since childhood! Ask for that! Come on! Whatever it may be, ask! I want a day off. Can I have that? Just that... I've been slogging away for years... I'm exhausted. At least you get Sundays off. I don't get even that. You see how I rub myself every night with herbal balms before I sleep. Just for one night, I want to sleep without that strong odor. I only asked as you insisted. Don't take it the wrong way. I sent Deiva to Kanyakumari! Today is her day off! She's sending me selfies with Rani aunty from the monuments there. What's with the crowd? I thought this milk 'pongal' offering would tank, but quite the contrary! Heard about this particular temple? They spent a lot of money in America and built a temple. But no one came! Clueless, they started offering 'rasagola' sweets. Only to get some, people throng! What do you picture when I say 'Tirupati'? -Laddoo sweets. And 'Pazhani'? -The Panjamirtham sweet. Many temples become famous thanks to their offerings than faith. Can I get some of that, too? -Sure. Hold on, ma'am. Fill this up! Are you happy now? They won't even let me in! They even set up a train across India to this place! All good, right? -No! One last thing left! There's one person! Her approval is necessary in Tamil Nadu for you to be accepted! She must come! -Who is that? L.R. Easwari! 'Let us celebrate Mookuthi Amman!' 'Armed with neem leaves, let us seek out boons!' 'Let us celebrate Mookuthi Amman!' 'Armed with neem leaves, let us seek out boons!' 'Let us celebrate Mookuthi Amman!' 'Armed with neem leaves, let us seek out boons!' 'Come forth, O Tridented Queen!' 'Come forth, O Tridented Queen!' 'Grant us our desires on this blessed day!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'Mounted on a ferocious lion... Draped in a saree of red...' 'She rose up as the Bannari Amman!' 'She rose up!' 'Riding a chariot of gold... With vermillion upon her forehead...' 'She rose up as the Thandumaari Amman!' 'She rose up!' 'Speak her name and all your ills will vanish!' 'She stepped up as the Samayapuram Amman!' 'Chanting the mystic Om... Adorned in a garland of skulls...' 'She walks forth as the Maasani Amman!' 'For you, dear Mother, we light up lamps of ghee!' 'Come down to us and rid our world of evil!' 'Amman's blessings are always with us!' 'Sorrows and misfortunes, we have no more!' 'Drawn in, the demon comes forth to hunt!' 'Those misguided spirits step into her fort!' 'Will this wild deity let them run rampant?' 'Will she stand by and watch their rampage?' 'The divine discus spins above her head!' 'She makes the demons quake with fear!' 'O Amman of gold and sandal! Help us conquer our battles!' 'O Mother Amman, show us the right path!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' 'O Mookuthi Amman!' Didn't expect such a turnout! -Who are you all? Devotees! -Why are you here? The Almighty is here! -What? God is appearing before us! How do you know that? -The entire town knows. Don't you? Come and see! Jesus! Moses! Raghavendra! All of them are messengers! God sent messengers! But we didn't believe it when they were alive! But those of us here are truly fortunate! Today, we will feel God's presence! We will see God! Every nation in the world, is clamoring for us to visit them! But today, God is right here! In your very own town of Nagercoil! Aren't we blessed? With no further ado, let us welcome... His Holiness... The one and only... Bhagavathi Baba! What is India's capital city? Delhi! You are aware of that! Which is the capital city of Japan? Tokyo! Excellent! Which is the religious capital of the world? Which is the religious capital of the world? Panchavanam! Panchavanam! The City of Happiness! The City of Holiness! The City of God! Spanning 11,000 acres... At Vellimalai in Nagercoil... In the mountainous terrain of Mookuthi Amman... Devoid of discrimation based on caste, religion or ethnicity... ...the city of Panchavanam will be formed! I will create my own city! Alright... why must I create it here? On February 29, 2016... For the very first time... Mookuthi Amman appeared before me! She said many miracles will happen here, thanks to me! She declared so! In the upcoming month of 'Aadi'... ...in the presence of Chief Ministers of eight states... ...and amid key dignitaries... ...will be the groundbreaking ceremony for the city of Panchavanam! This is no longer the temple of Mookuthi Amman! This is Panchavanam! Bhagavathi Baba's Panchavanam! The religious capital of the world! Do you know why we have ashrams in 163 countries? Why do millionaires donate hundreds of crores to this collection box? Out of faith in me? If they put in a hundred crores here... ...it won't show up on any official record, and can be reclaimed... ...in any of those 163 countries! The entire amount? -Indeed! We don't get to take the money from this box! But the commission from exchanging the money that goes in, is ours! Why are they donating 11,000 acres to us? Out of faith in God? It is to divide the people in the name of the same God! Only in Tamil Nadu, we cannot seek votes using religious cause! But we must make that happen in the next five years! That's where swamis like me come into the picture! That is the mission of Panchavanam! Whatever I feared is what's happening now! I fought it for six years. No one batted an eye. 11,000 acres... Is that unclaimed land? Do you know how huge it is? 45 kilometres. 118 villages. One large river. Six hundred ponds. Anything sown there will thrive. 150,000 people depend on it. What? -How do you know all that? I am God, man! Why do you think I appeared before you? Because I prayed wholeheartedly to you... As if you are Sage Vishwamitra! Like your penance called God to you! Then why did you come? -What did you say on the news that day? "Fifty deities here! Can even one not question this?" This deity will! Toss this away! What is this? -Toss it away! Did anyone notice a bomb go off here? Did anyone bat an eye? Place the same bomb in an airport. What would happen? I'd be arrested. In five minutes, I'd be branded a terrorist all over India! My family would be destitute! Exactly! What happens is not important. Where it happens, is. 48,000 temples and 450,000 acres of land for them all over Tamil Nadu! Do you know how much of it has been usurped? You have been a newsman for six years. Does anyone know the answer? Because this was an obscure temple until now. But now, even if a pin drops here, the entire world will take notice! I'll tell you now. Vellimalai is mine! These 11,000 acres are my territory! These are my people! They may have forgotten me... ...but when they are in trouble, I will come to help. I will fight back! Let's see what he does! 'All hail Bagavathi Baba!' 'Who is Baba? Where is Baba?' 'What is Baba? When is Baba?' 'Tennis Baba! Football Baba!' 'Cricket Baba! Marbles Baba!' 'Jolly Baba! Julie Baba!' 'Jollie Baba! Holy Baba!' '2D Baba! 3D Baba!' 'Hoodi Baba! Bhagavathi Baba!' 'Welcome, devotees!' 'Step up with faith!' 'Welcome, devotees! Step up with faith!' 'Rack up sack loads of his grace!' 'There will be a collection box! There will be yoga, too!' 'Sync up without a thought!' 'Meditate in silence!' 'You will shine in the bliss!' 'He is the epitome of wisdom and science! A sage par excellence!' 'Bhagavathi Baba!' 'Corporate Baba! Comrade Baba!' 'Walmart is your shell corporation!' 'Baba! Householder Baba!' 'Even Jim Carrey is your fan!' 'Bhagavathi Baba! Uber mass Baba!' 'Middle Class Baba! 'He came to us in a Rolls Royce!' 'Baba! The Moon-ship Baba!' 'Step up and battle the sun!' What is the time now? 10 o'clock! No... Now the time is... Eight o'clock! Come again? Because I stopped the sun today! I told it to come two hours later! How is it possible? It is possible! What is time? Distance divided by speed is equal to time! Speed by velocity is equal to mass! If that is mass, I am uber mass! 'Like an elixir, is his breath!' 'He is the creator of ecstatic enlightenment!' 'One who turns pebbles to diamonds... A magic-wielding wizard!' 'King Ravana may have ten heads!' 'But you're the true king of Cupid's revelry!' 'Resisting him is futile!' 'Wash his feet and move aside!' 'He transforms those innocent souls, who seek his grace, into trillionaires!' 'A meagre offering in a palm-leaf cup? That is a thing of the past!' 'Baba s intoxicating ambrosia will make your spirits soar!' 'Happy! Everyone is happy!' 'Let's pray with folded hands to this image of God!' 'Let's sing his praises!' 'Let's dance with joy!' 'Let's drape ourselves in yellow and seek eternal bliss!' 'Baba is our Godfather!' People used to live in harmony with nature... ...with no homes, no clothes and happily in the forest. But today? In the name of culture... ...they wear clothes and sit sadly in buildings. Why is that, Baba? Do any of you know why a building is referred to as a 'building'? No, Baba! Because when the building was built... ...a 'ding' sound would echo throughout! That is how the term 'building' came to be! 'Bhagavathi Baba!' 'Corporate Baba! Comrade Baba!' 'Walmart is your shell corporation!' 'Baba! Householder Baba!' 'Even Jim Carrey is your fan!' You are here? You were here all this time? Our house is a mere twenty minutes away! Did it not occur to you to visit me? Did you not once think to come and visit me? Did I bully you so much? What are you looking around for? -Take her away. Listen to me! -Oh no... Am I that big a fiend? -Don't make a scene like this! If you wanted to be an ascetic... -Take her away. ...you must have done so before you got married! Why do so after marrying me and having four kids? Why do it after all this? -Come! Look! Do you know her? You abandoned me when I was six months pregnant with her! She knows you only from pictures! You wretched cretin! Take her away! -Don't touch me! Your father, a 75 year old man, feeds us and keeps our family going! To atone for the sin of having you as a son! Get her out of here! As I wear flowers and vermillion, I cannot claim to be a widow! That is why I keep lying you are in Dubai or America! I lie about it! Sorry... I am sorry. Please forgive me. As it has been so long, all that was pent up burst right out! Come home! You needn't do anything. You needn't earn! My son earns very well! My kids will take good care of you! Please come! Come here, kid! Your father will take good care of you! -Don't make noise here, ma'am! Shut up! -Take her away! He wants to see you! -Come! If not for me, at least come for your kids! Mom! -Come home! Praise be to Bhagavathi! Before we met Baba... ...we were also living normal lives, like all of you. Family, children, wealth, job... We bore such needless burdens! We need neither money nor family for a happy life! We learnt that Baba's blessings is all we need! Now, we are with God! Are you an idiot? Abandoning your family to join an ashram is divine service to you? And this guy who says so is your God? He is Somasundaram's son. Let go of him! He is the son of our fellow brother Somasundaram! Dear boy... If I put myself in your shoes, your anger is justified. What do you want? -I want my father! You're trying to hoodwink my people and take all the land, right? I want you to leave! Please forgive this dear boy, O God! In the past, when God appeared before you, you'd forget yourself... ...and pray to him! But when God comes before you today, you interrogate him! An era of sin! Alright... Do you claim that I am not God... ...or do you claim there is no God? God exists! But you are not it! Then who is God? You tell me! Go ahead! Answer, my boy! God is a woman. Unlike you, she is beautiful. Dear boy... For a four year old kid, a toy is God! For a thirteen year old boy, his friends are God! For a young man, every girl he sees appears as God! Am I right? Alright, alright... Very well, my boy. God is a woman. You claim she is beautiful. You alone worshipped her, right? We need to see her, too! Call her! Ask your son to call God here, Somasundaram! Call her here! I will! -Do so! Want to see? -Sure! 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' She did not come! Where is she? She is not here! So... To summon God... ...you do not need rituals or penances of any kind! Singing such a song will suffice! 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'How many people would this upset?' 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'How many people would this upset?' 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'How many people would this upset?' Come here! Why do you ignore me when I call you? You knew my father was with that charlatan, right? You knew my entire family has been looking for him, right? You didn't come when they insulted my mother or when I called you! Why did you come now? You know I wouldn't come! Sure! As the problem was mine, not yours! When has any God come to help a human in need? How many movies I've seen! God turns up, asks for your desires, and fulfils them! But my God? "Make my temple famous! Transform India! Reform Pakistan!" A god straight out of a social reformation film! Keep eating! You're saying this out of anger. -Indeed, I am! If I go home, my mother will ask where my father is! What do I tell her? I will talk to her. At my house? -Yes. He is here? Welcome him in! Why didn't you bring him? Come in, dear! Your son is here, father-in-law! Come! -Mom... He did not come... -What? He didn't come now? Is he coming in the evening or tomorrow? We have a ritual in the evening. When is he coming? -He won't. "He won't"? Just ask Baba! He'll send him over! That man himself is a fraud! No! He is a man of God! Did he not rescue your father from nowhere? How many times has he come to this land of forests? Here on in, he is our family deity! Baba is a fraud, mom! Listen carefully to what I say. Our family deity? Yes, Bhagavathi Baba! I'll beat you to death! We went to Mookuthi Amman's temple, right? -Yes. I saw Amman that day! We saw her, too! You only saw her as an idol! I saw her in person! I spoke to her! She asked me to make her temple famous. She's in our house right now! Your brother's been tormenting me like so for quite a while now! He claims to see Amman all over the place! I really did see her that day! -My foot! Now he'll claim that she's over there! Who is that woman? Who do you see there, ma'am? She's sitting there! -Can't you see her? See her where? She's sitting there! Now I get it! The entire family is trying to drive me crazy... ...and planning to not repay the loan I gave you! I'll bring my wife over! If you don't pay up, you're finished! Something's wrong with his eyes... -Trying to fool me? Who is she, son? -Mom... She is our family deity. So, you've eloped since I didn t get you married in time? Mom! -You two are poles apart! She doesn't measure up to your good looks and complexion! Quit showing off! -So what? I'm being honest! You're my king, kiddo! With that huge earring alone, I can raise enough money to get you three married! Three layers of chain around her neck! You landed quite a loaded woman! -Mom... Look at that sly smile! What a glow on her face! Thinks she's Chandramukhi, eh? She is our family deity! Would three nose-rings make her a deity? Quiet! Look at her rolling her eyes! -That is our deity! You don't believe him, right? Ask me anything. I'll grant it to you! Our home must become a palace! With a swimming pool, fountain, a huge car and a watchman to guard them! The palace must have all high end appliances! We must all be adorned with jewelry and the house be full of cash! Our neighbors must believe we are multi-generation millionaires! Excellent! We always watch movies together. Yes, we do! Someone's coming! Is it the CBI? -No, mom! Our neighbor. Shiva from Belgium! What's in the bag? -I asked you for ten lakhs. You gave fifty. I came to give it back! I gave fifty lakhs? -Ah, fifty lakhs as there are five of us! Thanks a lot! Attention, everyone! Welcome aboard my flight! Go on, you loonies! Same thing happened to me! Yes, sir? -I didn t even mind losing everything... But saying you were Nepali, that I can t bear! Get lost! Your monthly salary! 50 lakhs! -Thank you! Oh no! Mom! It'll vanish if you believe! -What a huge house! What a huge TV! Now do you believe? Please say you don't! Shut up! We believe! Oh no! Where is all of it? Our carriage has turned into a pumpkin! Where did the chudidhar go? Where did it go, my boy? Where is it? -Mom! I kept telling you to say you didn't believe! You did not listen! If you believe in it, it will all disappear! I was a real lunatic today! Now do you understand? -Yes! You gave us everything and took it all away in the snap of a finger! You did not believe, it came. -The same dialogue! You believed, it disappeared! Something wrong with incense! Chew on the coconut nicely. Here you go. What are you doing? -Preparing for a milk bath. For me? -Indeed! Aren't you God? The sari is new. Can we do this tomorrow? You are God Amman, right? Can you use your power and settle Vijay Mallya's debt? He had six thousand crore rupees in debt and fled abroad! If you settle his debt, he will reopen his airline! Many air-hostesses will get jobs! Only if I get that job, can I leave this place. Some house, this is! Can't wait to get out of here! So what's the difference between you and your father? Evidence has been unearthed that Bhagavathi Baba is responsible... ...for the forest fire at Vellimalai. Such an incident has never happened here before! Images of thousands of trees being felled, and wild animals being slaughtered... ...surface every day, traumatizing many! This atrocity was never publicized in any other news outlet... ...thanks to Bhagavathi Baba's fortune! Despite many complaints filed, no action has been taken by the authorities! "When will his reign of terror end?", ask the people of Nagercoil. Got any sense? Think you're a hotshot CBI officer? What evidence do you have? It's in that hard disk. Are you a big shot? I repeatedly told you not to cover that guy! Do I run a satellite TV channel? To take action when you tell me to? Placing us on par with our channels, he's giving us advertisement spots! The money he gave is what paid your salary last month! Quit, if you're so high and mighty! You won't be able to find a job anywhere! Do you know that? You'll land up on the street with your family! Burn this piece of crap! Idiot! Thinks he's all that! Get lost! You brought my husband so near! Can't you bring him home? Why must he come? -What question is that? Must not a father be around to head his daughters weddings? That would be respectable... No channel, including mine, will air anything against that man. I was warned that I'd be fired. I'm in the middle of something important! Why intrude and blab away? I'm really pissed. Just sit there! Why are you pissed? For our benefit, she will be here for two days. Will she always be here? Before she starts giving appointments to others... Are you crazy? Always blab on like a lunatic! Would God go door-to-door? You're a 50 year old mother of four! Have you no common sense? When will you wise up? Your husband abandoned us! What have you done for us? Trusting him, you had four children! Why? To burden me? Crazy hag! Why are you yelling at her? He is right. I'm not a good mother. In every family, the mother begets and raises children. I begot them, but did not raise them. They raised and educated themselves. And I pulled out my eldest daughter from school. I wore her down with household chores and ruined her life. She never had what the other two enjoyed. These two think she's jealous of them. Not true. It is longing. She has no friends her age and does not go out. I really failed her big time! I wanted to do what was best. But so many thoughts in my head! My body did not co-operate. I met with over ten prospective brides for him! They all liked him. But who would come to stay with a family that has nothing? He has referred to me as 'lunatic' more times than as 'mother'. But I never got angry over it, because it is the truth. You have seen mothers who raise kids. But I'm a mother who was raised by kids! What is the point of this body? That is why he says so. You're right! It doesn't bother me. I am indeed a lunatic. They had neither a responsible father nor such a mother. I loaded my son with such burden... ...and he struggles. You've always asked why I had four kids. You're a young boy. I don't know how to explain it to you. I recall an incident. He was four years old then. My eldest daughter was an infant. I don't ever recall living happily with my husband. He beat me every day. I had no relatives who could help. One day, a squabble escalated... ...and he broke a soda bottle over my head! Blood gushed out! These two kids were crying around me! Afraid he'd hurt them, I grabbed them both and ran out! Once I got to the road, I didn't know who to ask for help. I had no relatives. So I hailed an auto and took them both with me to the hospital. For ten days, I remained alone there, like an orphan! That was when I thought about it. My children must not be orphaned like me. They need family! The only way for that? To have more kids! Once I pass away, they will be there to support each other! That was what I thought! That was why I had more kids! It doesn't matter what you say to me, dear. It doesn't matter what you say. My children must be happy. That's it! What if I bring back your father and finish off that charlatan? Shall we play a game? 'Step up hard!' 'Strike fear in your enemy!' 'Take to the stars! God says so!' 'Come end this tale!' 'Chase away that cunning fox!' 'Conceal and attack! God says so!' 'As the fire blazes, fry them to ashes!' 'Rip their damn hearts out! God says so!' 'As the town watches gleefully, get his final passage ready!' 'Lead the baldie to the pyre! God says so!' 'Come forth, O royal son, to chew them up and spit them out!' 'Come, gouge out the owl eyes of that vile villain!' 'Come, O mighty son, and shatter every bone in their bodies!' 'Step up to show them who I am!' 'As the Avengers, we will together protect the world!' 'The mighty Goddess herself, a Wonder Woman at our side!' 'We will snap the thumb of Thanos in two!' 'Step up to show them who I am!' 'Come!' Come out and hunt!' 'Bring out that whip and lash away!' 'Come shatter the fortress!' 'Like Dhoni, hit the last ball to victory!' 'Without knowing who we are, why do we yearn for those who care not?' 'Why do we forget that true heart that pours pure love, no matter what?' 'Anyone may lose their kith and kin...' 'But, time will bring forth change!' 'And, flowers will bloom again tomorrow! God says so!' I got a show on Vijay TV, where I get to interrogate Baba! Tell me the truth. You made it happen, right? You worked hard for six years. That is why you got it! Because of my hard work? 'Do not rest!' 'Do not stray from your path!' 'Do not falter, dear boy!' 'Your victory is of your own making!' 'Step up hard!' 'Strike fear in your enemy!' 'Take to the stars! God says so!' 'Come end this tale!' 'Chase away that cunning fox!' 'Conceal and attack! God says so!' 'As the fire blazes, fry them to ashes!' 'Rip their damn hearts out! God says so!' 'As the town watches gleefully, get his final passage ready!' 'Lead the baldie to the pyre! God says so!'

'Step up to show them who I am!' 'As the Avengers, we will together protect the world!' 'The mighty Goddess, a Wonder Woman at our side!' 'We will snap the thumb of Thanos in two!' 'Step up to show them who I am!' 'Step up!' Greetings! Greetings and welcome to 'Baba and his Devotees'! I am your host, Engels Ramasamy! For the first time ever, Bhagavathi Baba will speak to God live... ...to seek answers for appeals, doubts and troubles of his devotees! Relay your problems via video call to the number at the bottom of the screen! With no further ado, let's welcome Bhagavathi Baba! Greetings! Aren't you Somasundaram's son? Would you like to say anything to the people, before we begin? Devotees around the world! If you tell me your troubles, I'll interact directly with God Amman... ...and give you solutions! All your sins will be washed away! To purge your sins, start video calling right away! Let's go to the first caller! Praise be to Bhagavathi! Greetings, Baba! I came to visit you in the year 2010! Since then, my business has flourished! Why did you call, Uttamchand? What is your trouble? I have no trouble, sir! Hang up! We'll go to the next caller! No, sir! I do have a small problem! All kinds of items get stolen from my store! The CCTV cameras aren't yielding any leads, Baba! Please help, Baba! Bad vibration! You are surrounded by negative energy! -Oh no! It pollutes those who work for you! To get rid of that taint... ...there is the Salagrama stone at our ashram... ...taken from Gandaki, the holy river in Nepal. Buy it and display it at your store. Not just that, but I must conduct a 'Chakra' ritual... ...for your entire staff and tie a holy thread on them, too! That thread will shine a light on those who intend to sin! Very well! I will buy it, Baba! You can buy the stone and the threads on my website! Once you do, not a single item from your house or store will be stolen! Thank you very much, Baba! What is the guarantee, Baba? -What? What is the assurance that buying these will prevent thievery of any kind? God only provides boons. There are no warranties! How can that be? A bulb worth ten rupees comes with a six month warranty! You will get three to four lakhs for these items, right? Can it be right if there is no guarantee after paying so much? I knew you'd do this when you sat across me. I'm not the only one who says it! It is in the Bhagavad Gita, too! If you're skeptical, read that scripture and educate yourself! Isn't this the Bhagavad Gita? Tell me the page number and chapter and I'll read it now! The Bhagavad Gita has no chapters! It only has hymns! My apologies! Which hymn is it? Just a minute! I know this! We all do! It's the opening theme of 'Mahabharatha'! 'Whenever evil raises its head...' Am I right? Isn't that right? As none of us read the Bible, Bhagavad Gita or Quran... ...people randomly quote something from somewhere... ...and coin their own meaning! Is there any connect between the hymn he sang and what he said? With your permission, can I give a solution to this problem? Yes! Go ahead! Uttamchand! You look handsome enough to play Alia Bhatt's father! Just look at your employees. Like actors in a tragedy! You'd spend a lot to buy the items Baba suggested, right? Divvy up that money and give it your employees! Pay them and feed them well! Buy them new clothes during festival times! Never mind all that! Just give them a stool to sit on, so they don't have to stand all day! If we treat our employees well, they will take good care of us! I guarantee you that! Until next time, signing off tonight is your friend, Engels Ramasamy! Come here, my boy. Here you go. Buy yourself a couple of nice shirts. Sit down, everyone! Conduct a Sudharshana ritual, and your son will get a job! What's the guarantee? I studied engineering! How can I get a job? Use this stone, and your house will be finished in a year! What's the guarantee? "Following Bhagavathi Baba's show on a private network..." "...the hashtag 'WhatsTheGuarantee' has trended nationally!" "Photos and videos of Bhagavathi Baba being cruel towards his disciples..." "...at his ashram, have surfaced on the internet, to the shock and anger of many!" "Comedic videos of Bhagavathi Baba..." "...show he's funnier than great comedians like Goundamani and Vadivelu..." "...and have become huge hits among netizens!" Here is today's caller on the show that makes millions laugh out loud! My father's name is Ramachandran. He suddenly took ill and we learned both his kidneys have failed. The doctor said I can donate my kidney to him! As I married a girl of another religion... ...my father won't accept my kidney! He's a disciple of yours! He'll listen to you! Please convince him, sir! Don't call me 'sir'! Address me as 'Baba'! I'm sorry, Baba! Please convince him! He's fighting for his life, Surendar! And you ask for permission? Quit wasting time and arrange for the surgery! Ramachandran! -Yes, Baba? What you are doing is absolutely right! All these years, you stayed off meat, performed rituals six times a day... ...underwent fasting and cleansed your body. Accepting a kidney from him, is like injecting poison into your body! The day you wed outside of your religion, your blood got polluted. If he dies without getting a kidney, he will still end up in heaven! If he lives after getting your kidney, it is the same as death! If you believe what he said about your son's blood being polluted... ...I have a question not just for you but to everyone like you! These swamis look for religion in blood. But why don't they look for it in money? Hard to follow, right? All swamis have ashrams worldwide! Bhagavathi Baba himself has ashrams in 163 countries! In New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Netherlands... Are all the devotees there members of your religion? Their money is pure, but their blood and kidneys are impure, right? Never mind foreigners! Our town's tale! One I've been telling for six years! Bhagavathi Baba's dream project: The Panchavanam scheme! He claims it to be a place he created across 11,000 acres... ... where people of all religions can congregate joyfully. Blood must not mix... ...but how can religions come together in his dream project? You have doubts about it, right? So do I! Shall I explain why? No, Baba! I want to explain! -No need! I brought all the paperwork! Shall I spill? This is from Tamil Nadu's Charitable Endowments Department. It says when people of other faiths come to a temple or ashram... ...said religious entity no longer falls under this board's control! So, income from these others do not go in their records! They needn't pay income tax on it! They can keep every penny! They are not accountable to anyone! The same 'religion' they make money from they use to divide us! Surendar... even if he won't own it, you are still his son. You don't need his permission to be his son. And Ramachandran... Get well soon. Physically and mentally. Baba will elaborate on his claim that the blood of those of other faiths... ...is impure, but their money is not, on our next show. He must do so! "Will Bhagavathi Baba's crimes be investigated? His ashrams be sealed?" He has ashrams all over as a front to launder money! He didn't deny it! He must be investigated! He must be investigated for the forests he destroyed and the lands he usurped! To think they trust such people! -They cause religious acrimony! They'll destroy forests to build ashrams? -No need for Panchavanam! Tell him to leave! Who owns whose land? These people need to be imprisoned! Not just him, but every charlatan in this country must be vanquished! For the shape we're in, is Panchavanam even necessary? They'll drive us crazy! Deport this man! Our reputation is far more important than our reach! Those who once bowed to me, now laugh at me! Am I a comedy piece? One blow after the other, they execute this with finesse! This TV show takes the cake! For the sake of ratings, if every stranger asks for a warranty... ...we cannot survive! Don't shout, Baba! Everybody leave! Leave quickly! Look at this! -I will not look at anything! Look at this! See what I found! Look! These five people are responsible for all the shenanigans at the ashram! They sprinkled something besides javadh! They sprinkled herbs in place of banta! One more thing! Your interviewer is from the same family! The son of the family! Look! All to rescue their father? That is irrelevant! Tomorrow is the inauguration! We have to do damage control! Get here fast! We're in big trouble! What are you saying? -They said we were caught on camera! Gather everyone and escape out the backdoor! I'll bring the car over! -We're there! You hurry! This way! -Come! For the sake of ratings, in the guise of an interview... ...a private channel methodically humiliated me! The purpose of this scam was not just to destroy my brand! There's also been an attempt on my life! Do you have proof or is it mere speculation? I have proof for everything! A family pretended to be my devotees and stayed at my ashram... ...and carried this out! It is a guy from this family that interviewed me on TV! Who wants to ruin Mookuthi Amman's dream project? What religion are they from and what nation? I need to know the brain behind this operation! I issue an open challenge to the family! Questioning and humiliating me... Ruthlessly targeting me... All of it was to put the brakes on Panchavanam, right? Now, I will stop it myself! At tomorrow's inauguration, if that man answers the three questions from me... ...I will end this! I will put an end to the project of Panchavanam! It is an open challenge! That family must not be around tomorrow! No one's about! Let's go! -Come, Grandpa! Come on! Get in! Hurry! -Get in, everyone! They're coming! -I told you to take the back door! Why take this way? -I know! I'm your mom! Drive! Let's go! What's wrong? -The car won't start! What are you saying? -I forgot to fuel the car! Busted, eh? How dare you try to hoodwink Baba himself? Quit talking! Slice 'em up! Mom! -Go on! Try stabbing me! The knife won't pierce me! Once she gets here, she'll crush you into smithereens! There's someone here! Go search! Who the hell is she? -Such disrespect! How else am I supposed to call her? Ever see someone spurt and die? -What? Ever see someone spurt blood and die? No. Why? Am I going to see it today? Not today. -Why? Because you'll be the one doing that! You will soon learn the truth of my mother's words! Aren't you the guy from TV? You asked Baba for warranty, right? A Japanese knife! Still sharp even after slicing 300 people! Want to see? Go ahead! -O God! Stab me! But what will become of you next? She'll rip your feet open and shove it up your nose! She'll split your skull and stuff it in your ears! Consume the juice from your brain for dinner, she will, God Amman! What happened, Pappu? What did you do to Pappu? I'm sorry, ma'am! Whatever it is, let us talk it out! Remove the hex on my beloved Pappu! We'll deal with her directly! Call her! You got it! I'll call her! 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'How many people would this upset?' 'Upset...' 'Our dear brother... While showering love, no one's better!' 'Our dear brother...' Why did you sing that? -The same tune! 'Murder! Bloody Murder!' 'The whole family's getting murdered!' 'The family's gotta be slaughtered!' That's also the same tune! Quit singing and pissing me off! End her and this'll all be over! Don't! She's my sister! Hey! Who the hell is this? Like someone out of a stage play! Kill her! (A religious hymn plays) The fight's over? Expect God to fight for 30 minutes? -Point taken. Shall we leave? I'll ask only three questions! If they are answered... ...I agreed to shut down the dream project of Mookuthi Amman's Panchavanam! Here I am! Who's here to answer me? How can they possibly come? They won't! Stay calm. Your magic is unparalled, O dear God! At a function where so many dignitaries participate... ...you presented these criminals in front of millions of people! This family infiltrated my ashram and tried to kill me. We all know that! Shall I say something you don't know? Shall I do so? How did milk surface from the snake mound of Mookuthi Amman's temple? Answer me! Does anyone know? Do you? Answer! Shall I answer it? Look there! Pick it up! -Yes, sir! I'm Ravi Varman. A friend of Engels. He used this motor to have milk spurt out from that mound, to engineer a sensation! I repeatedly told him not to, but he ignored me. A scam of the ratings hungry media! They do anything in order to raise their viewership... ...and even use God's name for it! The next thing he did is a criminal offence! How and when did you steal jewelry from a temple? How, dear boy? Quite the liar for a swami, you are! At this rate, you'll blame us for any crime in the country! Look there! I bought these jewelry at Engels Ramasamy's behest! I didn't know they belonged to a temple! Please forgive me! And that's it for larceny! Here's another crime! He is not of sound mind! Many have seen him talk to himself! No! I'm not crazy! I did not talk to myself! Then who did you talk to? I talked to God! I'll tell you another story! This man came to my ashram one day... ...and claimed to have seen God! I asked him to call God! He even sang a particular song... What song was it? Right! 'For me and you...' 'For me and you...' 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'How many people would this upset?' 'For me and you...' 'For me and you...' Who are you, dear? She is Amman! Check this out! Amman, it seems! In a way, what you said is true! God is indeed a beautiful woman! Alright, Amman! I'm fine with you being Mookuthi Amman! Why set up a motor to make milk flow from the snake mound of your own temple? You could've made that happen with the snap of a finger! Why use this man? Aren't you God? That's true, right? If I wanted to do something, I would've done it myself! Why use this man? In the same way, if any God wanted to help people... ...they could directly do so! Why do it through swamis like you? Why a broker in the middle? We are not brokers! We are divine guardians who protect God and religion! This world is a mere speck in a large universe! You're not even a tiny speck in this world! And you protect God? Alright, you do so. But which God will you protect? The God who created you? Or the God you all jointly created? Are you aware of how sacrilegious you sound? Do you know how God will punish you for this? Oh, I absolutely do! The God you created? 'Your' God? "This is a sin. That is a sin." "That penance for this sin. This sentence for that sin." Fear, fear, fear! For everything! Your God relies on fear to drive things, right? He'll meet the rich right away but make the poor wait in queues! He even gives special treatment to killers and thieves! Pay up just a little, and he easily forgives sins, right? Isn't that your God? That's enough. That's enough of you people protecting God! He can protect himself! Excellent speech! Who asked you to make such speeches to ruin my reputation... ...and halt my project of Panchavanam? What religion has your back? What country has your back? If someone questions you and points out any wrongdoings... ...you accuse them of being backed up by other religions... ...or funded by other countries, right? How much did you get paid to speak this? Compared to what you paid to deceive people and swindle 11,000 acres... ...to gain permission to start an ashram, I got paid much little! You keep blabbing as you wish! What do you know about him? Never mind what I know! What do you know about him? You went to him as you found it hard to manage your family, right? When he told you the right choice was to abandon your family... ...it didn't occur to you to question that, right? What do you all know about these so-called swamis? Why must a swami start a medical college? Why must a swami contest election? Why must a swami sell shampoos and condiments? Why must a swami sell anything? "You do this, I do that. I do this, you do that." Bargaining only makes them businessmen! Your fear is what funds their business! Get rid of the fear! Do not pray out of fear. Pray out of faith. The God who created you, expects nothing in return. Tell your problems directly to Gods. They will listen! They will talk to you! When Gods can talk to people like him, why won't they talk to you? Believe. 'I had seen you as a mere stone!' 'You showed me your true self and filled my mind to the brim!' 'Where were you hiding? Why did you vanish?' 'I searched for you far and wide, only to find you within!' 'This is all I need. No more boons, I shall seek!' 'Is this bliss, O dear God?' Do not search for God outside. God is within you. The God within you, is the best version of you. That will decide who you really are! "The appearance of a mysterious woman at the inauguration..." "...of Bhagavathi Baba's Panchavanam, has caused a stir within India!" "Across Tamil Nadu, his ex-devotees and the people..." "...are protesting hard against him!" "The 11,000 acres of land that was presented to Bhagavathi Baba..." "...will be returned to the people, per the orders of Chief Minister LKG!" "He ordered all charges against Baba, including forex fraud..." "...to be investigated by the CBI." Thangam! I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I realize it now. I lost my sense of self. I should not have left. Please forgive me. Oh no! Don't apologize! I must be the one to do that! I created quite a ruckus at the ashram that day! I'm ashamed to even think about it! Actually, our family doesn't need you! We're happy! My son works hard and earns well! My daughters study! Should fatherless girls not get married? So be it! Let them work for a living! Good things will happen for them! As your swami was a fake, you got out. There are several more people like him! Go visit them all! Don't have money? Give me some, son! Give me your hand! Have the time of your life! Happy Journey! This is out of anger at me. Oh no! My mind has never been more clear! Don't confuse me! Call if you need anything! Right, father-in-law? Bye! 'For me and you are a perfect match!' 'No one else can attain what the two of us share!' 'No one else can attain it!' I figured it was you! Usually I sing this song to summon you! Now you sing it to call me! Just that I left that day without a word to you. So I came to ask if you need anything. Are you asking me if I want any boons? So, God has appeared before me to fulfil my wishes? Yes! You mean God has come before me to make my wishes come true? Ask me if you need anything! I don't want anything! I want nothing! A palace? Who will maintain it? A Sony fridge? Sony doesn't make them! At least that magic bike? Dogs would chase me! Think it over well! I'll vanish now! I swear to God what I have is enough. When God appears before you, like she did before me... ...don't make a list of things you want. It will never be enough. Just a little faith and courage will suffice. We can face our own problems. Do not doubt if God will come to you. She definitely will. Because you are a God chosen child!
