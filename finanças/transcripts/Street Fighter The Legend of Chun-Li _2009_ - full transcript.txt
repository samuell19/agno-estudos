Ready to put away your anger. You are the only one who can bring your father back, and I can help you do it. But you have to do it my way. Just tell me where he is. You don't know what you're up against. Let me show you. [ Horns Honking ] [ Gen ] These are the slums. The people are suffering. The streets are being taken over by a criminal organization... called Shadaloo. I used to be a part of'em. When you fight on the side of monsters, eventually you become one yourself. That's why I changed, saw the better way. The Order of the Web. I created the Order to fight injustice- to protect the people who can't fight for themselves. What does this have to do with my father? Everything. Your father was a very well-connected businessman. His relationships could open any doors in any country anywhere. Many people wanted those connections. People like Bison, the leader of Shadaloo. My father would never help someone like that. No? Not even for the safety of his only daughter? - What do you want from me? - I'm giving you a chance to join us, to become part of the Web, to fight for something far greater than yourself. I already know how to fight. Impress me. [ Gasps, Grunts ] [ Groans ] Anger isn't gonna guide you. Trust me. I know. [ Knuckle Cracking ] [ Gasps ] Why are you mad right now? Because you're hurting me. No. You're hurting yourself. You fight with passion, but your anger distorts your judgment. Bison will see right through you. [ Gen ] Believe in your true self. Look for an innocence beyond the anger. [ Sighs ] You still got a long way to go. [ Chun-Li Narrating ] Bison, the same man who took my father, was here in Bangkok. I'd never been so close... and so far away. I had to research his organization. I had to find out about Shadaloo. [ Woman ] I must congratulate you all, gentlemen. You've shown remarkably sound judgment. Not many municipal governments would take such a bold stand... against the criminal elements of their own population.

Mr. Bison thanks you foryour continuing support. [ Woman On TV Speaking Thai ] Local authorities refused to comment on this controversial decision.

He said the state just sold the majority share of the slums to Esperanto Security Company. Everything from the harbor to the markets. Ofcourse. It's a front for Shadaloo. Bison's bringing crime into the neighborhoods to drive the land value down. And then he's buying it back up wholesale. - We gotta move on then. - Okay, we're on it. Come with me.

Like me, he was a criminal... with no future. His parents were Irish missionaries... who died in Thailand when he was very young. Soon, the boy became very ill. Where he was, no one cared about the sick. So they left him... to die. [ Crying ] But the child survived. With each passing year, he became more and more feared, and a well-known thief on the streets. He took what he wanted when he wanted it. - [ Shouting In Thai ] - But even that wasn't enough. He yearned for more. So he went to the dark caves in the Phang Nga Bay... and brought his new wife. From ancient tales, he'd heard about the dark forces... that could free a man from his conscience. He had to transfer the goodness of his soul... into his unborn daughter. [ Flesh Tearing ] [ Woman Screams ] [ Flesh Tearing ] [ Baby Crying ] [ Crying ] The transformation was complete.
