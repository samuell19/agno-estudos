Good morning everybody The reason why I have invited you all is .. It's been told that for the past 15 years, our nature has changed a lot due to global warming Due to climatic changes we are affected by earthquake, tsunami, life damage and material damage We are leading an uncertain life fearing What's going to happen next? Moreover, people's mind have also changed since the changes in nature occurred The livelihood of humanity is deteriorating If this continues, the future of humanity will get destroyed It's believed that the advancement in technology is the cause for this damage I got an idea here The technology which we think has affected the nature.. Can't it be used to conserve our nature? It's just my idea I am not sure if this is possible But I have faith in you people. I wish to contribute something to the next generation I am funding an amount of 5000Cr for this and the time period is three months Proposal details will be sent to your email id The best presentation next week shall be awarded the project Good luck friends So friends... The reason why I wanted to meet you all is... ..to discuss on the 5000 Cr ASC meeting which took place today morning.. ..the entire IT world is looking on us now to know who's going to take the project So, I have a plan If all the four of us take this project together and work Our status, values and shares remain the same Good idea! We will work together Are you all ok? Mmm..interesting I am not okay with this We haven't done any project together We are now in this status based on our individual talent and dexterity So, according to me I think this as an opportunity to prove ourselves A year before we were in the 50th position, today we are in the 4th position How? Purely on teamwork With the faith I have on my team, I will try to takeover this project Mr.Sivanesan, do you think you can takeover this project and complete it alone? Good luck to you friends Leave it Danny, Let him go We have seen so many like him We can't leave him like that He has come from 50th place to 4th place without anybody's support Chill He shouldn't win We can steep to any level for it We have to succeed in this And it's the right time to achieve our goal Do you all know my goal is wanting to be number one! So guys.. From all branches of our company... ..shortlist the best software engineers and programmers Select the best ones and ask them to head this project But Sir.. The reason why our company moved from 50th place to 4th place.. ..is the master brain of our Chennai branch engineers We can give them this opportunity Sir I am sure they will definitely do it Yes Sir He is right Oh Lord Ganesha This project should be a grand success (Mobile ringing) Sorry boss... Unwanted call Bye Boss Hey..Stop Why are you stopping me? Wait Brother Mmm.. Is this the guy? It's not him.. Send him He's going at 7am like a mason's job Brother..please stand aside Wait dude Hey..

Will we spare yesterday's bud? Ladies and Gentleman .. Please be seated Hey Sir Please Sir Sir please take your seat Sir please give some time to explain my project Please Sir Okay Go ahead Thank you Sir Thank You Sir Sir I am going to explain my project in tamil language With your permission.. I will submit my project Sir Nothing wrong Mr.Kannan I like your simple and honest approach What's happening there? Go ahead Thank you Sir Sorry Mr. Stop your presentation! You didn't come here to sell your country sign It is an international issue So you should stop your emotional stupidity Madam..I will give you a language converter You can listen in your language Kishore..Please share the language converter When I speak in tamil, you can listen in your language We will learn Hindi but you will not learn Tamil Take this Have this Gayle's sister Thank you Enjoy "A boy sharpened his pencil, trees collapsed" When we listen to this poem we can hear the applause sound But we don't listen to the weeping of trees We spend time to upload videos about Agriculture.. But we never even plant a weed We talk about green revolution in english, tamil and hindi I thank this initiative of AAC to save the trees during this time The storm which hit recently affected six districts badly But Gummidipoondi, next to Chennai didn't see a drop of rain. People are wandering like dogs for water We have to do something about this The first step to it is "Save trees" Three can breathe from oxygen released from one tree But not even a single tree has been planted by them The more we destroy trees.. Oxygen depledes Then nature will recede completely Even with the latest technology in hand We still look for a newspaper for updates The papers used for these newspapers, books, magazines.. ..worldwide contributes to the destruction of 3.5 to 7 billion trees If we stop paper manufacturing.. Cutting of trees will stop totally If we change from paper usage to digital.. We would need a server for it We would need huge acres of land, thousands of workers And crores of money An alternative to this issue is our project It's called Virtual storage It will get stored in space like radio frequency We do not need a big space, security or maintenance Too good and brilliant! A small room of 10X10 size is enough No one can access this without our knowledge We need not look elsewhere for informations This virtual storage is undestroyable If we begin to action on this We can put an end to the practise of cutting trees for paper Our motive wins We will have a satisfaction that we.. ..did something good for the earth we live in Thanks to AAC for giving this oppurtunity Thank you (crowd applaudes) Very good Guys After having seen all the four presentations I have come to a conclusion Infact I have made my decision That Mr.Kannan and the company VCL gets the contract I would like to tell them that I will sign the contract And give them a huge amount as advance Shit Hello Sir Welcome By the way She is Ms.Gayathri from Virginia Gayathri .. This is Mr.Kannan One of our company team leads Hi.. Good day... Loser Good day.. Hi... Good day.. Hey..sit down I wanted to get a water bottle Why are you jumping for it? Kannan...

The welcome dolls at the marriage halls.. ..will fit best to your family Hey...who's this corona affected monkey in your family? He's my elder sister's son He's the one pushing for my marriage Because he can marry only after I get married Why don't you register in animals matrimony for him? His name is Mayakannan (Song playing from the movie "Enga ooru pattukaran") Komatha.. Don't worry, I will milk you without causing any pain Look..he's milking the cow without touching it Don't act as if you're seeing it for the first time Workers please sit down We are continuing our acting as if we don't know It's usual Okay come on guys Will you always pretend? When will you milk for real? Don't you know that it kicked me When I touched it by mistake Shut up Now I understand, why you are still a bachelor? Are you married? Nope You are ditching your brother And roaming with his wife Don't talk to me He's so scared to touch a cow.. Then how come he'll be ready for marriage I will take care of that Have you given injection to the cow? Not yet Why? The needle broke Did you use the needle for yourself? Blackji..have you bathed the buffalo? Not yet bro There was no water Morning I saw someone bathing near the well That was me bro When a buffalo like you took a shower can't you bathe these cows You useless fellow Buffalo! Brother. What is it? Your family went to look for a bride for your uncle Why have you joined them? Hey... Those guys roam every week like a town bus I am not interested Will your father not get angry if you don't join? Don't take his name I will get angry Why is it so ? Is he behaving like a father? Looks like a pappad on the menu One day I will thrash him Why? From childhood he told me that I will be a landlord And finally made me a cow lord Be happy that he had not made you mann pigs Is manning pigs a shame to you? Those guys are the richest nowadays (Song playing from "Enga ooru pattukaran") (Mind voice) (Looks like a film heroine) Hey Who is this? She's the granddaughter of our labour Valliamma She is clever in milking cows Really She's like your sister Let her decide on it Shut up you Fraud broker What a big vessel! Hey you slipped the vessel The milk fell over This is a sign that our family failed today morning What curse is this? Where ever we go We couldn't fix a girl for you I am feeling very low dear Why do you worry about this? Your wish is to get me married My wish is to get married and be with you I want my children to grow with your love All will be fine Don't worry mom Who is the next girl?

He's a team leader in an IT firm IT is always fun Party every weekend Not only that.. As a team leader he should make good money Life at Chennai, luxurious car Will be fun with her hubby Weekends will be full of fun Tell me kid My grandpa likes you a lot Leave your grandpa.. What about the groom ? Oh aunty.. My Kannan grandpa is going to marry this aunty What is he blabbering? Old man!

This kid is calling him grandpa and me as granny My friends are laughing at me I am feeling ashamed When I get married and go outside I will be named as granny Not only that.. I wanted to lead a private life in Chennai I am not interested to be a part of a 40 member joint family What is she saying? She was happy when we brought this proposal I am wondering why is she talking like this? Oh So.. You felt ashamed for being called as grandpa He's my sister's grandson.. He has to call me that way only Who are you to reject me? I don't like you! Appearance gets changed by age. But the relationship doesn't! In this world we can see fleet of birds and herds of animals But we humans have forgotten the essence of joint families The reason is selfishness No matter who come and go in your life We look only for blood relations When we miss someone from our family Tears roll down to prove the strength of the family To live with out that strength is like.. ..to lead a nomad life in our own land Both pain and life.. ..can be felt only when we get hurt To lead a life with such pain is hell To live with my family is my boon The wealth I leave behind is my family and relations only I cannot lose them at any point My family is important to me Let's leave mom What's all this I don't need a marriage without you all Move Neutral family Live alone! When you go with four relatives itself Your marriage cannot be fixed easily When you take 40 numbers ..unimaginable You could have left everyone behind and taken one fellow We tried that way too (Song playing from the movie "vaidehi kathirundaal") (Indistinct chatter) (Cows mooing) Why are these guys running? Oh..he's here! Why are you troubling the workers and the cows? It's all because of you guys I am still a bachelor Listen to me When the girls I fell in love got married I am bidding then adieu. Do you know why? I have put on weight by waiting. Why? All men of my age are into family Why I am still single? Hear me My youth and feelings are known to these animals and plants You dumb fellows don't get it Why? Why are you asking me that? Will throw the cow dung on you What's your problem? You are my problem You run after others to get them married If you had married I would have settled Why are looking for a bride for the past three years? It's not matching What's his fault? Will break your mouth You are the main reason for it What did I do? You did nothing! If you had married, we would've got married The time has to come for it Your time is over See what I am going to do now Here onwards we will not take the entire family to see a bride Three persons will go and come back as four What do you say? I have to get married quickly for his sake What was that? Nothing Listen to him I will get you married soon You will be a father in ten months He'll resemble me My dear sister's grandson I am your grandson too Ok dear As per your wish As you planned Tomorrow we will take him We three will go to fix a girl Until then please control yourself The cows are getting scared Will stop today If it doesn't work out tomorrow Will start my show again He's getting his girl Don't miss this time Come on Let me bath today You were willing to come today, weren't you?

I have to do all these for marriage I am trying hard for this marriage Shit Mayakannan, You better know the truth Information has passed from here to here I understood you clearly I am having my doubts on you Did you share it with only your mom or anyone else? I swear on you, I haven't told anyone else I still have my doubts Shut up I am bearing with you Were we brought up like that? Your upbringing was nasty I can see an antenna roaming Why did you tell them? We cannot leave our uncles behind..that's why Why are you doing this? Listen to me I cannot leave my brother-in-law So I called them too What do you have to say to this? What can I do? You will never change Let's hope no one is waiting in the next street Move on We obeyed you and stood here Uncle, I think there's a procession going on Let's take the next lane Hey, it sounds like fathers voice, Stop guys! Who informed him? He's standing like a speed breaker! How cruel These guys are coming where ever we go In our family we are allowed to use only the rest room in private Rest with the crowd Hey Mayakanna.. You planned to go and see the bride without us How is it possible in our family? How's that possible? You occupy the entire village Okay ..why are you guys late? Grandpa...who's this? We enquired about that girl She will not be a match to our family Let's leave this proposal If you roam around with this bear You will never get married... In all your births Come on dear Yes sister As it is you are a rogue Why do you mingle with them Let them be in peace I will tear you into pieces and eat you Get lost Look at him Looking like a pencil in the sharpener! What shall we do grandson? We cannot do anything with this family There's one thing we can do? Let's start singing.. (song playing from the movie "vaidehi kathirundhal") Dogs are chasing us...

I saw your joint family here I felt very happy I was surprised to see this kind of family at these times In the name of neutral family, People are living as separate islands For the sake of survival, Running for the sake of family The truth is, we run away our families In order to feed their family and children.. Leaving them behind People go to different places to work Even missing their family time We wish to feed our children's good food But we fail to feed our parents But at your home You are all affectionate with each other You adjust for each other You gave my name to a new born calf I wanted to live in this house with all of you Is that wrong? Those who do not have parents are not orphans According to me... ..those who don't receive love are orphans After coming here I do not feel in such a way Now I have people to care about me and love me I feel very happy about it now Despite my lonely life..
