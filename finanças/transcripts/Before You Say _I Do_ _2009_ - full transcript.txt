Okay. We feeling better yet? Well... ...you sure knowhow to make a guy happy. This would be perfect if Iwasn't afraid I was going to lose an eye. Sorry My fondue wenton a. Very dangerous. I think I the last one I had was when my 8th grade girlfriend took mefor my birthday. Yeah? Mhm. I thought you said therewere no girls before me. No, what I said was there wereno great loves before you. I wish I was your8th grade girlfriend. I bet you were so adorable. But that might bebroken up by now. I don't plan on everbreaking up with you. I don't care whenwe would have met. Whenever we laid eyes oneach other we would have fallen madly in love. You're a hopeless romantic. Admit it, it's true. Right, whenever we laid eyeson each other we would have fallen madly in love. Say it like you mean it! Whenever we laid eyes oneach other we would have fallen hopelessly, completely in love. Better. All right, so why did it takeyou so long to find me, huh? Perhaps because you werebusy marrying someone else. How could you let me makesuch a stupid mistake? I didn't even know you. My point exactly. You're right. I'm sorry; I shouldhave found you earlier. You should have. Well maybe I can makeit up to you right now. Oh yeah? Janie? What just happened in there? Do you really think aftereverything I went through in my first marriage that I'dbe prepared to do it again? Yeah, I hope so. Doug was awful. It was a nightmare! I'm not asking youto marry Doug baby, I'm asking you to marry me. It's all the same. Sorry, I didn't meanit the way it sounded. It's just... it'll end withsomeone's heart being completely shattered and Ican't sign up for that again. What are you saying? It's me, it's George. I want to spend the restof my life with you. I want us to bemarried, to be a family. Well I want us justthe way we are. Please, baby please; We'vegot everything already. I don't have a wife, youdon't have a husband and we don't have marriedand forever. Did you know that foreverlasts no longer than a year and usually ends in divorce? Well not if you marrythe right person. Really, how canyou be so sure? I've never been so sureof anything in my life. I just... I don'thave that luxury. I don't wantanybody but you. Nothing's going to change. I don't want anyonebut you either, that's what I'mtrying to tell you. A romance like oursshould end in marriage. Well for an add man, that'sa great ; Marriage where romance ends. I want to be your husband; I want to spend my life making you happy. I am happy. I am. I thought Dougloved me, you know. But all he wanted was a wifewho was smart enough to take to business dinners and dumbenough not to know he was messing aroundall over town. Do you love me Janie? Completely. Do you want to be with me? All the time. Then stop thinking about usas some other relationship you once had. We're us; We'remeant to be together. We were meant to betogether a long time ago. The ring is amazing. Marry me? Hi. Happy Monday darling. Happy Monday. Hey, those are gorgeous. Oh, I know. Calla liliescan't resist them. Oh dear Jane got a ton ofmail today; It's all there.

We usually stay with myfamily at that time of the year and I'm not sure how they'regoing to feel about this. How should I handle thissituation without upsetting my parents? Signed, a little mixed up. Dear Mixed up: Divorceseems the only alternative. Your husband's inconsideraterequest shows that he puts his mother before you. This is unacceptable, sincerely, Dear Jane. I can't print those.

Please tell me in concrete, earth bound terms ...what are you doing here? I got my heart brokeand I skipped town. Really? I lost the woman I wanted tospend the rest of my life with. What happened? After her first marriage toa guy that was completely wrong for her, she wasscared to death to do it again. But I was so sure about us Iconvinced her she had to be my wife. But while I was offcelebrating our engagement she was sinking into a holel didn't know existed. Then one day she was gone. What was she like? Beautiful, smart, funny, a little nutty. No one every made mefeel the way she did. That's so sad. She broke my heart. You're too sweet tohave your heart broken. Feeling a little better now. Maybe you'll fallin love again. I think so. Mm, you're a romantic. I like that. Night George. Baby I just had themost vivid dream. Weird too. Oh... hello? Doug? Oh, no, no, I just woke up. No, I'm fine, I'm fine. I just...

Okay, well I'll just see youat the rehearsal at 4:00 then. Oh, no, shoot, I forgot topick up my wedding shoes from the office and I really need them. You can? Really? Oh no, that wouldbe so great. Okay, okay, thanksso much... all right, I'll see you then. Yeah, you too. Bye. So that's it? One I'm sorry andeverything's fine? Oh come on George, everybodyfights before their wedding. That's just whathappens you know. He said he was sorry. He said he had to worklate and ...I believe him. Why do you believe him? Because. Because we've been togethera really long time. What does that matter? You weren't so willing tobelieve everything last night. Forget about last night. I don't want to forgetabout last night Jane. Hey, something washappening last night. Okay, last night youand I drank some wine, shot the breezeand fell asleep. That's it, okay? I'm getting married tomorrow and I really have a lot of things I'vegotta take care of. You're not in love with him. George, I really gotta go. George? Pick up the phone. The Don't ThrowAway, Mary speaking. Hello? Great! Uh, George, whenthe phone rings, you're supposedto answer it. I'm sorry, wasthe phone ringing? Yeah, it was. Are you okay? Uh... I can't stopthinking about Jane. Oh... I knew it! Is it that obvious? Well you see with my psychicabilities I could tell from the beginning that youwere deeply connected. In fact, I would say that you probably loved each other very muchin a past life. Future. Future? We love each otherin a future life. Future lives? Yeah. Why don't I knowabout these? Sit down Mary, you'regoing to be the first to hear all about it. I knew that you weredestined to be together... in the past I had doubtsabout my predictions, but not any more. This is proof. I can tell the future. Well you were rightabout Doug too. Today when he's supposed tobe at the wedding rehearsal he's actually upstairs in the honeymoon suite messing around with thewedding coordinator. Oh, I was rightabout him too? Oh, but that's awful. You know Jane said shewished somebody would have taken her upstairs and shownhere who Doug really was before she got married. Why don't you? Well I don't want to break her heart. There's got tobe an easier way. Well does she know howyou feel about her? She couldn't miss it. Did you tell her? I didn't tell herright out exactly. She's do for a final fittingat Westwood Bridal now. All right, I'm going to tell herexactly how I feel about her. Yes. You know what; If thewedding's not cancelled by 4:00 this afternoon, youcould be my date to the rehearsal dinnertonight, okay. And then together we couldtake Jane up to the bridal suite and show her thatDoug started the honeymoon without her. I mean it'll sting, but it'snot going to sting as much as if she married that jerk. Love will prevail. It has to. And if it doesn't, thefuture is on your side. Whew! The future! George. May I come in? Oh, sorry. Excuse us. What are you doing here? I really wanted to see you. Mary told me you'd be here. I'm glad you came. I wanted to see you too. I'm sorry I snappedat you this morning. It wasn't fair. You look incredible. You think? Yeah, like a picture. I love my dress. Have you been practicingyour first dance? Oh no, god no. Doug thinks its torture. You could practice with me. We don't have any music. ♪ : I think of you every morning, ♪ ♪ dream of you every night. My parents used todance to that song. I used to think it was so embarrassing. ♪ Darling I'm never lonely, whenever you're in sight. ♪ ♪ Now I think its romantic. ♪ I love you; Forsentimental reasons. ♪ ♪ I hope you dobelieve me... ♪ I've given you my... Youdon't need any practice; You're a wonderful dancer. Jane, I'm in love with you. George... timingis everything. You're not married yet. Maybe if we had metearlier or under different circumstances... Marry me tomorrow. It's crazy. I don't even know you. You don't know me. I could neverdo that to Doug. Why not? Why are you so loyal to him? He's a liar and a cheat. Okay, that's enough. Please, please, youshouldn't even be here. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. I'm just absolutely certainthat you are making a very, very bad decision. Look, Doug is going to be myhusband and you are going to be that really great guy I metright before I got married. Okay, so stop makingme miserable please. You're miserable becauseyou know I'm right. You're miserable becauseyou're about to marry a guy who doesn't know you hate daisiesor how you take your coffee. You have to leave George. This isn't the marriageyou dreamed of. We are. George. I'm not going to sit by andwatch you make a mistake. You don't have to. You're not invited. Just go. Please go. I didn't realize my maid of honor was bringing a date. I'm sorry to do thisto you here, now, but there's something youneed to know about Doug and it just... it can't wait. You just don'tgive up do you? Do you even know where Doug is? He's running late. He'll be here any minute. Jane, he's upstairs in the honeymoon suite with another woman. You brought him hereto tell me that? Jane, Doug ischeating on you. I didn't want to have totell you but you need to know the truth beforeyou get married. I do know the truth. Prove us wrong then. Let's go upstairs. If you're so sure he's notupstairs with another woman then come with us. I mean what could it hurt? Fine. Fine. You want me to go up there, let's get it over with. Now remember Janeyou're not alone. We're right here with you. Doug! What are you doing here? Honey, you'reruining the surprise. Surprise? Your wedding present. Oh my god, yougot me a present? I didn't get you anything. Oh... thank you. Oh look, your friendsfrom the office. Hey. I think they were just leaving. Honey, I'm so sorry but I forgot to pick up the wedding party giftsfrom your place. Oh no, shoot. We gotta passthose out tonight. I know. Oh, maybe George herewouldn't mind running over there and gettingthem for us. Me? Yeah, you did pick them out. I'm sure Jane would reallyappreciate it if you could do that for us. Sure, whatever. It's fine. Thanks. That was so embarrassing. I don't understand whathappened unless somehow Doug knew we were coming. Maybe he's from a littlefurther into the future than you, huh George? This is so sweet of you. Let's see what we got here. What is this? An IOU? Exactly. IOU the weddingpresent of your choice. This way you can go outand get whatever you want. Now don't worry, there'll beplenty of time for you to get me a gift too. Okay. Well we should probablyget down there huh? They're probablyready for us. Why don't you go first? I should check in with theoffice before we start, okay? Okay, but don't betoo long, all right. I won't. See you down there. Yes hello, I'd liketo report a robbery. My girlfriend's keys wererecently stolen and her neighbour just called sayingsomeone suspicious was trying to getinto the house. Just a minute honey. Yes, 14083rdAve. Apartment #4. Exactly. Can you send a car over there right away please? Thank you. How many honeymoons are youplanning to have in here darling? Just as many asl can get sugar. We don't have time for this. They're alldownstairs waiting. You don't want an uncoordinatedwedding now do you? I'll take my chances. I know that George and Ilook like idiots up there, but I'm telling you, Doug is up to something. Where is George anyway? He didn't even comeback with the gifts. I know, it is kind of late. Maybe he was just tooembarrassed to come back. Well he should be. I mean how could you believesomething as ridiculous as Doug and the weddingcoordinator? Because George told me. He is very intuitive. George knows things. Well he certainly knows you. Well he was wrongtonight wasn't he? Unfortunately. So my maid of honor issorry that my fiancé is not cheating on me. You're fired. Fired! Oh, what a relief. Now I don't haveto hold my tongue. Hold your tongue? Every other word out of yourmouth is some wise crack about Doug. Yeah, but I never really gotto say what I needed to say because this whole maid of honor thing tripped me up. I mean but now Georgeis here and I'm fired. So here goes. I know what itslike to be alone. I know what its like towant someone in your life. I know what its like to justtake anyone because you just can't believe that anythingbetter is going to come along. Mary, you will findsomeone, I know you will. We are not talking about me. Don't settle for Doug, especially now that you've glimpsed a future in whichthere is the kind of love most of us will onlydream about. Doug! Jane! You two should be up herepracticing for tomorrow. Oh daddy, you knowDoug hates to dance, and besides I already practicedearlier at my fitting. You and your dress dancedtogether at the bridal shop? No, George was there and I was in my dress and the moment just sortof took over. Is he a good partner? Yes he is. He can dance? Yes, he can. And he's great to hisfriends and he's loyal and charming and kindand attentive and... Jane, George loves you. He really loves you. And wherever orwhenever he's from, there's no denying that. You and George aremade for each other. It's a fantasy Mary. George is a fantasy. Doug is reality. George is three days, Doug is five years. George is impulse andintuition and Doug is... Doug is what?
