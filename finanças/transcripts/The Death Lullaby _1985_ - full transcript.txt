The fare of the limited express train is high. Why...? "Harada animation studio" It is a problem of politics. I cannot reply anymore. The Death Lullaby Today's class is over! Stand! Wait up, "Deppa!" (Buck tooth) Where did he run away to? You are not saved! No no no. You're a buck tooth! A dwarf! How dare you try to run away from us? Alright, sanction him! Die! "We give priority to safety" This bullet train is the fastest train in the world. It's developed by Japan, which is the best in the world when it comes to technology. It is a Japanese pride! The start of its service is soon. Buy it! I want this. Careful, don't run! It's dangerous! Are you OK? Are you OK? The boy "Deppa" was born in Kiryuu-shi, Gunma on April 13, 1962. His father was a soldier, killed in action. His grandfather drank methanol during the war, and lost his eyes. Later, he died of a brain hemorrhage. The boy lived with his mother and grandmother. The boy went to a relative's house after his mother was hospitalized with a disease. During these days there was no laughing. Kiryuu-shi is a mountain city famous for baseball in the southeastern part of Gunma Prefecture. It developed as a textile and a silk market. In this town, fog is generated in the morning and the evening. The town still retains its old-fashioned scenery due to escaping air raids during the war. The day before being taken to the relative's house, Deppa was eating brown sugar while looking at the chimney of a dyeing factory. He still remembers it clearly now. The relative's house where Deppa was taken in had a child of the same age, but the boy was also lonely here. "The town of the building does not have tomorrow, and there is not the memory, too." "I lose a peaceful house and go for a trip... without the hope in a few minutes." "Who notices my corpse if I die alone?" "Do you sing? A lullaby of death." "The lullaby that never wakes up." "Hoshino Hospital" Who did this? It is me! If you have any complaints, protest with physical strength! "I'm a stupid buck tooth." What are you doing at this hour? Um, I'm going home. Didn't you skip school? No... That's wrong. OK! The police will let you pass. Passing by is my freedom! What I do is up to me. Elementary School Teacher Forced Phase of Every Day Life After School Hell Come back to the school! Is this boy really a child? Though it is daytime, he is crouching in a damp, dark place all the time... Every day Deppa played alone. Searching for a new place to play every day, He wandered alone in a strange town. No one really knew where he was in the strange town. It was the most relaxing time for Deppa. Imagining the trio looking around to bully him, Deppa felt a little better, spending hours gazing at the flow of an unfamiliar city.

"Bupposo" (Buddhist Prayer) "Jyusanbutu" (Buddhist Prayer) "Because, at that time, a visit to my mother was interfered with" It is the memorial day when this new express train operates today! A politician and a famous person celebrate this day. It's finally time to depart! Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Apologize! Who are you? You stepped into my house.
