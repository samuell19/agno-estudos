Production Mezhrabpom Film Screenplay and Direction: D. Vertov Assistant: E. Svilova Photography: Surenskii, Magidson, Monastirstkii Sound: Shtro Composer: Shaporin Orchestra: Blok THREE SONGS ABOUT LENIN In every corner of the planet Earth, in the countries of Europe and America, in hot Africa and beyond the Polar circle, they sing songs of Lenin, the friend and deliverer of every slave. No one knows the nameless authors of the songs, but the songs themselves pass from mouth to mouth, from tent to tent, from hut to hut, from mountain camp to village on the plain. Our film has been made out of three such songs from the Soviet East. One song is of woman, throwing off her veil, of electricity, brightening the mountain village, of water, flowing through the desert, of the illiterate, reading and writing, of that which is ILYICH-LENIN. One song is of the October Revolution, of that which is ILYICH-LENIN. One song is of the war for a new and happy life of that which is ILYICH LENIN The room in Gorki where Lenin died, its windows face the park. Here is the bench we know from the photograph SONG ONE "My face in a dark prison lay" My face in a dark prison lay And blind my life remained No learning mine nor light of day, a slave although unchained Till through my darkness shone a ray and Lenin's truth I gained We never looked upon his face We never heard his voice Yet closer than a father he much closer to us was No father for his children did what LENIN did for us MY state farm MY state farm MY country MY land MY land - Do you see the mark? - I do. - And the bull's eye? - Clearly. - Hold your breath. - OK. - When you feel you're ready, shoot. - OK. - The target is easy. - I see. - Get ready to shoot. - OK. Pull the trigger and discharge the cartridge. From darkness thick he made a light from deserts gardens green And out of death the life he brought through him the poor have seen. MY university MY factory MY collective farm MY collective farm MY collective farm A million sand grains make a mound, A million corn a sack, A million of the weakest straws, Break the strong camel's back! MY family MY hands STEEL hands MY party With all he had he took our part: He gave his brain, his blood, his heart SONG TWO "We Loved Him" We loved him as we loved our steppes; no, more than that! If he would but return, we would give away our tents and steppes If he would but return, we would give away our lives! Never will we forget him, Our grandchildren's grandchildren shall remember! He founded our party of steel He built it from year to year Taught it and tempered it In the stubborn and ceaseless struggle it was tempered He was tireless in work His eyes were full of irony and sparkling with wisdom Now he smiles kindly His burning speech is inspiring the masses THE FOUNDER OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL THE LEADER OF WORLD COMMUNISM THE LOVE AND PRIDE OF THE INTERNATIONAL WORKING CLASS THE BANNER OF THE DOWNTRODDEN EAST THE HEAD OF THE WORKERS' DICTATORSHIP IN RUSSIA He was simple and straight in his manner The Russians called him just "ILYICH" He lived in a hut; in a hut beyond the marshes In this place in July and August 1917 in a hut made of twigs the leader of the World October lay hidden from his pursuers and wrote his book. We have built a monument of granite - The Workers In October he led them into battle through breakdown yet they come through cold YET THEY COME through hunger YET THEY COME through fire YET THEY COME THEY ARE LED BY ILYICH LENIN STAND TOGETHER BRAVELY FORWARD AGAINST THE FOE TO US VICTORY IS ASSURED THE POWER OF THE LANDLORDS AND CAPITALISTS IS BROKEN IN RUSSIA AND WILL BE CONQUERED THROUGHOUT ALL THE WORLD LENIN Ah, now he moves not LENIN Ah, he is silent THE MASSES MOVE THE MASSES ARE SILENT YOUR HERITAGE AND YOUR WORK WE SHALL COMPLETE. HOW OFTEN HERE ON THIS RED SQUARE We saw him - the LIVING Lenin! SONG THREE "In the big stone city" In Moscow In the big stone city In a square there stands a tent And in it lies LENIN And if you should ever be in sorrow Then go you to this tent and look on LENIN And your grief will pass away from you, like water And your grief will pass away from you, like water And your sorrows float away, like leaves upon the brook The day is bright And I'm so happy Dancing in the street For my mother and father We're happy Why shouldn't we dance? The spring is in full blossom Our life has become sturdy and joyful True is our Lenin path And on every sector of the front, step by step, we are conquering for Socialism our huge country. I was working on the dam across the River Dnieper, handling cement to supply the crane in bay 34. We poured 95 baskets of the stuff into the body of the dam. When we pulled out one of the baskets and levelled the concrete, I noticed that a piece of pitched paper roofing had fallen on the freshly laid surface. I picked it up and put it back in its proper place. But suddenly I lost my balance. At first, I grabbed the stairway. But I wasn't able to hold onto it. Everybody got very frightened. Another girl started screaming and our foreman pulled me out. I was completely covered in liquid concrete and soaked to the skin. To the skin. My face was covered with concrete and my hands were stained by liquid tar. They pulled me out and took me upstairs to the drying room, where there was a small heater. I went back to my post and I worked until the end of my shift. THE DNIEPERSTROY BUILDING FACILITY I was awarded the Order of Lenin for fulfilling production quotas. NO FORTRESS IS INSURMOUNTABLE FOR THE BOLSHEVIKS This magnificent structure is our greatest memorial to the builder of Communism and the first made to bring electrification to the Soviet Union, Comrade Lenin. If LENIN could see our country now! I am 63 years old. This year I have harvested 5,500 kgs of wheat. When I brought it to the state evaluator, there was a special meeting and festivities. If all collective farm workers worked as hard as I did We're working relentlessly, notwithstanding the fact that we have no flour. I feel that our leaders are speaking real words of wisdom. These words must be written down and remembered. They must be passed on to everyone when you return home. We want to do everything the way our leaders tell us. You want to lead a life on the collective farm in the right way. You may think of how it was in the past, but the Bolsheviks reject any retreat. You must not think of past difficulties but always look to the future, how to proceed forwards. It is not easy, you have to live through it and digest it, to understand how to approach it. And only after you understand it all, may you act. If LENIN could see our country now! OUR oil OUR coal OUR metal If LENIN could see our country now! Our Magnitostroy If LENIN could see our country now! If LENIN could see our country now! If LENIN could but see our country now! STAND FIRM STAND TOGETHER ONWARDS BRAVELY AGAINST THE FOE TO US VICTORY IS ASSURED THE POWER OF THE LANDLORDS AND THE CAPITALISTS IS BROKEN IN RUSSIA AND WILL BE CONQUERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD OCTOBER CENTURIES WILL MARCH ACROSS THE FACE OF THE EARTH WITH IRON HEELS AND PEOPLE WILL FORGET THE NAMES OF THE COUNTRIES WHERE THEIR ANCESTORS USED TO LIVE BUT THEY WILL NEVER FORGET THE NAME OF LENIN THEY WILL REMEMBER HIS NAME FOREVER THE END
