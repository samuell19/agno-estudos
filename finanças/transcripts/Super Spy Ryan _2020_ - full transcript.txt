(gently chiming music) (dramatic music) (slow electronic music) (upbeat electronic music) - Whoa, oh, no, a missing gummy! Yay, now it's perfect. - Gus is gonna love it! (television chirps) - [Television] Incoming call, Combo. Incoming call, Combo, incoming call, Combo. - Mommy, Gus's birthday party in the Virtual World is starting soon. We have to go! Where's Daddy? - He was wrapping Gus's presents in the living room. He should be done by now. Let's go! (upbeat chiming music) - [Television] Incoming call, Combo. - Ryan, Gus's birthday party is starting! Come on over! - And don't forget my gummy cake! Yay! - I'll be there as soon as Daddy's done wrapping presents. - Guys, I think I need a little help. - Okay. - Not this kind of help, oh, no. That's for the presents, Emma, Kate. - Don't worry, Ryan, you go ahead. We'll meet you at the party. But first, can you show me how to get there? - Sure, Mommy, I'll show you. (dramatic orchestral music) There's a secret button back here. (button chirps) (Golden Console throbs) First you have to turn it on. (Golden Console trills) Now punch in the secret code, R-W-3-2-1. Virtual World, here I come! Bye, Mommy. - Bye, Ryan, have fun. (upbeat electronic music) - Whoa, this is so cool. Well, I better hurry 'cause I'm running late to Gus's birthday party. Oh, it's pizza, get over here. Oh, I didn't get it. (whistle tweets) Whoa, a soccer ball, that was fast. (dinosaur roars) Look, it's a dinosaur egg, and it's cracking! Transform! Whoa. Yeah! (upbeat electronic music continues) (happy electronic music) Hey, guys! - Surprise! - Ah, Alpha Lexa, this is not a surprise party. - Every party's a surprise party! (Ryan sighs) - Hey, Happy Birthday, Gus! Cool presents! - Thanks, Ryan, look at this present Peck invented. They look like normal glasses, but check this out. X-Ray Spy Goggles, - [Group] Whoa. - Oh, gosh, it's nothing. - Activate! Oh, wow. (slow electronic music) Wow, gummies! How did everyone know exactly what I wanted? I have the best friends ever! (slow electronic music) - [Robo Combo] Pack Rat, look! Ryan's in the Virtual World! The moment we've been waiting for. - [Pack Rat] Robo Combo, there it is! Zoom in, zoom in! - Now zooming in, Pack Rat. - Ryan's Golden Console. (Pack Rat laughs) He uses that to come to the Virtual World. Now it will belong to me, the Pack Rat, so I can collect anything I want from the real world! (laughs) - But Pack Rat, what's so special in the Real World? - Birthday presents! I want them all, starting with the ones in Ryan's house! Oh, she just turned on the Golden Console. (alarm beeps) - The wormhole has been activated! (Daddy wails) - Ah, watch out! Are you okay? - Now is my chance. (alarm blares) (Pack Rat laughs) Oh. (slow ominous music) - Hey, I thought the portal was open. - It was. Wait, what's going on? The portal was here. Where could it be? Oh, no, the Golden Console! It's gone! (slow ominous music) - What do we do? - The Golden Console is mine! (laughs) Oh. - My sensors are detecting a glitch. It would appear that everyone and everything is being, um, baby-fied? - Huh. Well, every plan has its glitches, and this one is tiny. A baby glitch! Get it, Robo Combo? (laughs) Laugh with me, Robo Combo! (Robo Combo laughs dutifully) (everyone cries out) - Everyone, stay calm. - What is happening? - Guys? I feel weird. - Hungry weird? Or too many gummies weird? Or- (Combo Panda cries out) (Gus squeaks) - What's going on? (overlapping chattering) - Gus just took birthday to a whole new level. What kind of panda-monium is this? - Oh, gosh, this is exactly what I was afraid of. Ryan's Golden Console is in the Virtual World, and that means it can turn us all into babies! - [Alpha Lexa] What's happening? (Ryan gasps) - Well, well, well, who do we have here? (gasps) - We have Ryan because I asked you to hack the signal! (Robo Combo growls) Oh, right. Well, well, well, indeed! (Robo Combo sighs) - The Pack Rat. - Huh? Who's that? - That evil chipmunk who tries to collect everything. - Actually, Combo, he's a hamster. - A hamster who looks like a chipmunk? Whose name is the Pack Rat? Uh, that's so confusing. - Excuse me! How dare you! It is I, Pack Rat the Hamster. Not a chipmunk or a rat! A hamster! And Pack Rat is a fine name. - Uh. - The Golden Console is mine now, like all the birthday presents will be! (laughs) - Guys, it's up to us to save those presents and stop the Virtual World from being baby-fied. We have to break into the Pack Rat's lair and get my Console back! (slow electronic music) (alarm beeps) - [Peck] Good thing Super Spy Gear has been my Super Secret Project! - [all] Whoa. - [Alpha Lexa] Oh, awesome. (overlapping chattering) (energetic music) - Watchie talkies! - Ooh, I want one! - Super Spy Team, let's gear up! - [Moe] (excited gibberish) (slow music) Hold on. Who's babysitting? - [All] Not it! - Huh? (slow suspenseful music) (babies licking) - Oh, man. - Don't worry, Gus and Moe! We'll get my Golden Console and get you back to normal in no time! (upbeat music) - [All] Super Spies, raise 'em high! (slow electronic music) (robot beeps) (Pack Rat grumbles) - Is he ready yet? Make sure he's programmed to collect presents. All presents! Presents, presents, presents! And that cake too! And don't forget the presents. What's taking so long, Robo Combo? - (sighs) The next thing you should collect should be patience. (ominous electronic music) Hey! - Thank Ryan's family for me. This Golden Console works perfectly! (slow ominous music) (Kate mumbles) - Where can it be? - [Emma] Where can it be? - It's gotta be somewhere. - I'm telling you, the Golden Console was stolen! - But that's impossible, no one knows about the Golden Console. - Well, where is it? Because I've literally looked everywhere. (dramatic music) (robot whirs) (robot beeps) (Daddy screams) - I think he took it. - Get him! (overlapping screaming) (electronic chase music) (comical chase music) (overlapping screaming) (comical chase music) (overlapping screaming) (comical chase music) - Oh, no, I can't believe this. We have to tell Ryan the Golden Console was stolen! (upbeat electronic music) (drone engines whirring) - [Alpha Lexa] Whoa, that's a lot of GuardBots. - Don't worry, I have a plan. (slow music) - Hey, I think these disguises are actually working. Oops! Uhh. - Keep it down. (sighs) If we make it, maybe we can take the elevator straight up to the- - [Watch] Pick up, it's Mommy! (group cries out) (overlapping chattering) It's Mommy! - No! (robots creaking) - [Alpha Lexa] What should we do? - Never mind. You guys go ahead. I'll handle these GuardBots. Slime Blaster, activate! (dramatic music) (elevator dings) - Everyone, get in! - [all] We're in. Hurry! Come on! (panting) Hurry up, Ryan! - [Ryan] See ya, slime bots! (group sighs) - [Watch] Pick up, it's Mommy! Pick up- - [Group] Come on, Ryan! - Silent mode! - Ryan, someone- - [Ryan] Stole the Golden Console? - Yeah, someone who wants to collect Gus's cake and birthday presents. - [Ryan] That someone is the Pack Rat. I'm going to get it back. You protect our presents! - Don't worry, Ryan, I've got it covered! (laughs) Oh, hey, give it back to me. Hey, wait! - I better go help him. Good luck! (sighs) (upbeat music) - [Alpha Lexa] Wow! - [Combo Panda] So many toys! - [Ryan] I see a door across the room, and that giant key must open it. - [Alpha Lexa] Guys? I think we're in a claw game. - And we have to be the claw. - Who will it be? Ah! Buckle up, Peck! - What? Oh, gosh! - I'll go first. Let's play! (game trills) (electronic carnival music) And grab, Peck, grab! (Peck cries out) - [Alpha Lexa] That's not the key! - Peck, don't squeeze it too hard, or-- (Peck cries out) (overlapping chattering) - Huh. (electronic carnival music) It's my turn. I'm Alpha Awesome at claw games! Peck! - Ahh! - [Ryan] Hold on, Peck! - [Alpha Lexa] Yeah! - Got it! Now please bring me back! (Peck babbles) - [Alpha Lexa] No! - [All] Peck! - Hand Grabber, activate! (dramatic electronic music) Ahh! (Peck cries out) Hold on tight, everyone! - Gotcha, Peck! (grate snaps) (group yells) - I've got you guys! (dramatic music) We did it! - [Combo Panda] Yeah! - Ah, let's use the door next time! - Let's get moving! (Pack Rat yells) - Robo Combo, go stop those super annoying spies once and for all! But first, has my henchman collected any birthday presents from Ryan's house yet? - Uh... About that, gotta go! (Pack Rat growls) (slow suspenseful music) (robot beeps) - Umm. I don't think he knows what a party horn is. - I don't blame him. Those things are confusing. (robot sniffs) (gentle chiming music) (party horn blares) (Robot crashes) (family laughs) (slow suspenseful music) - Hey, wait, come back! - Get him! - Get him. - Let's go. Hurry. Got you, robot. - Give me the presents. - You are not going anywhere. - I can help. (Mommy laughs) - [Daddy] Look, he can't move. - Perfect! - Yeah. (family cheers) - No! (slow music) (slow ambient music) (grate rattles) - [Combo Panda] Whoa! A treasure collection! And I'm sure they won't miss one. Hyah! Combo, likey. - Combo, we don't have time for treasure! We have to get the Golden Console back before- - Alpha! - Yeah! (babbles) - Don't worry, Alpha. We'll turn you and Peck back to normal! - [Robo Combo] That's what you think! Huh. - [Both] Robo Combo! - The Pack Rat and I are impressed that you made it this far. - [Ryan] Uh-oh. - Not good! (dramatic music) - But you will make it no farther! - Oh, yeah? We'll see about that! Super Spy Scuba Mode, activate! (upbeat music) - Challenge accepted. It is on! - [Ryan] Sharks! - [Combo Panda] Yikes! - Let's split up! - [Combo Panda] And trap him! (ominous music) - Ready? - Yeah, come on. - You are going to regret that! - Combo, keep Alpha and Peck safe! - On it! (upbeat guitar music) - That's it! An escape hatch! Hyper Speed, activate! (rocket thrusters) - [Robo Combo] Not so fast! - [Combo Panda] Ryan! You're gonna crash! (Ryan yells) - [Robo Combo] No! System reboot. System reboot. - Epic fakeout! - [Ryan] Quick, before he wakes up! Turn it this way. - And, uh? Uh? Whoa! (both yelling) (water erupting) - Ahh! - Whoa! - We did it! No! Combo! (laughing) - Combo! Combo! - All my friends are babies! How am I supposed to save the world without their help? (watch clicks) (slow suspenseful music) (robot creaks) (upbeat music) - Let's get him! (robot whirs) Great. Now we need some help! - [Both] Emma, Kate! - Get the robot! - Wrap him around. - [Mommy] Go, Emma, Kate! (overlapping chattering) (Kate laughs) - [Daddy] Oh, good job. (Daddy laughs) (phone chirps) - Oh, it's Ryan. Why don't you go help them? - I'm on it. - Ryan? - [Ryan] Mommy, everyone else turned into babies. I have to save the Golden Console all by myself. - Ryan, you're the strongest and bravest Super Spy Leader around! You can do this. - [Ryan] But this whole time, I had help from my friends. I can't do this without them. - You can do anything. I know you'll surprise yourself. And, who knows? Maybe your friends will surprise you too. - Uh, Mommy, I need your help. (slow whimsical music) (Mommy sighs) - Daddy does not surprise me. (Daddy groans) - Go help Daddy. (Ryan sighs) (slow orchestral music) I can do this! (upbeat music) Here we go. Hey, Pack Rat! - You made it past my collections? My Bots? Even Robo Combo? - Of course I did! I'm here to save my friends and save the world! - Really? (energetic electronic music) That's what you think. (laughs) - Get back here! (upbeat electronic music) Take this! - Ha! You can't catch me! - Magna Ray, activate! Take this, Pack Rat! Hyah! (coins clanking) - Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! (panting) (Ryan cries out) Now I've collected you and your presents! - Why do you care so much about birthday presents? - No one has ever given me a birthday present. So, I'll collect my own! - You should have said so! We would have thrown you your own birthday party! - You're too late! With the Golden Console, I have everything I need to throw my own party! (laughs) Oh! - Hmm. (Ryan gasps) (slow music) Well, you don't have everything. You're missing the most important part of all, friends. And if you don't believe me, we'll show you! - We? (upbeat music) (babies laughing) - No! Stop it! (wails) Where is, where is the light switch? Not this! Not that one! No! No! I can't see! (buttons beeping) (frustrated gibberish) (Pack Rat laughs) Found it! Finally. Wait, what? - [Ryan] Hey, Pack Rat, looking for this? - What have you done? (upbeat electronic music) - Hee-yah! - No! (alarm wails) (ominous music) - Guys! You're back! (Pack Rat cries) - Don't be such a baby, Pack Rat! - We saved the Virtual World! (group cheers) - [Combo Panda] All right, Combo-Bunga! - [all] Yeah! (upbeat music) - Come on, guys, we've got this. Teamwork! - You're not getting away, robot! - Come on, guys! We've got this! (robot whirs) (television pulses) - Look! - Ryan did it! (dramatic music) (television chimes) - The robot's gone! - Yay! (family cheers) - We did it! - We did it! Good job! (upbeat music) (upbeat electronic music) - More gummies! - Hey, it's time to party! (group cheers) - Yeah! - I love being old! This is the best birthday ever! - Open wide! - Open wide! - Yum, yeah! More cake! - And pizza! (dramatic music) (Pack Rat sneers) (upbeat electronic music) - Oh, I didn't know you were still here. Well, thank you for watching my Super Spy Adventure. And join us next time! Oh. And the Golden Console? We have to keep it a secret between you and me. Shh. Thank you for watching, bye! Remember, always stay happy and rise up. Bye! - Catch ya soon!
