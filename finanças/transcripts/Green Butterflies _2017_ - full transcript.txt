Do you want me to punish you now? Do not get involved in more trouble. Lucas stayed, please. Sit down. Какво стана?What happened? Leljo, you know I'm trying to avoid trouble. But that did not stop you now. Matteo and Daniel have a tooth. I defended myself. You did not have to fight them. Keep silent or do something else. You are the director's nephew and that engages me in trouble. You have to be an example. Did you get it? - Yes Madam This is the last time for you. Go! Hi, Grandma. Are you angry? This director hates me. I can not stand this. Do you want your mother to talk to her? When? She is always on her way. She never has time for me, Grandma, never. Oh, Mateo. Do not be unfair. Your mother has to work a lot, because ... ... how do you think he pays for all this? What do you think? I'm just tired! I'm sick of your modern way of life! I Bank to Pound? I give you everything I get! Well, Rodrigo is not enough. Not enough, because we have a high standard of living. And I'm the one I got tired of. I'm tired of being guilty of everything. Walk and earn more money! Matteo, my love? Matteo? Matteo, he opened the door. Open, please. My love... Mate ... Matte, she opened her grandmother's door. Rodrigo! Hello my love. - Hello. Dear, come with me for a moment. I want to show you what I've bought. Will they still quarrel? - Not expensive. Dad and mom have to talk about something. Come here. Do not worry. I was in school and late for the fees. Can you explain how it happened? You know the school is very expensive ... Look, Rodrigo ... - She's down here ... This is the only obligation and you can not do it. I'm tired of being responsible for everything. I want you out of my house! No problem, but I will take my son. - Oh, really? Are we ourselves? No, my love, just talk. How will you afford to take care of him? I want you to get out of my house! You could not wait even to get things together. Why are you so quick to get out? What? Daddy will not live with us more? No my love. From now on, your father will live somewhere else. Dad, I'll listen now. I promise! Please do not leave. It's not for you, my love. Come here. It's not for you. It is for other things. Things will be the same. We'll go to football, in the library ... And everything will be fine. It will not be the same, Dad. Without you, I will feel very lonely. No, my love, I always I'll be home for you. Can you see? Your grandmother will be with you. You will not be alone. But I do not want you to leave. It did not make it harder. Please. Release it, Mateo. Come here, my love. Come on. Sit down and finish your meal. Matteo, please. Hello, how are you sonny? I'm sorry I could not answer the dates. I was in class. Yes come. This will be great. I'm waiting for you here. Hi, Mateo, what are you doing? I ... read "Crime and Punishment" What is this? This is a novel from the world literature. This is not a school book, is it? No, but I love to be ahead. Look, I thought ... that it would be goth if we go to cinema or ... or on a walk, what do you think? Boys and girls, I have a surprise. See what I bought. She is very sweet. No? "When will you wear it?" Well tomorrow for the party. No wonder the breads are over. That's why you look like that. Like a whale ... ... thick and oily. You're talking stupidity. - Of course not. You have to thank me, that I care for her health. Besides, do you know what? This is not your job at all Enough. Not worth it. He provoked you, Mateo. Here's Daniel to protect him little Mateo. Do you think he is like him? Why do not you get out of here? Do you remember what the director said This is from worse - worse and no one is doing anything! No one! I really regret that, what you tell me about this boy Lucas. I suggest you stay away from him, so that nothing happens. What I want most is to beat him and leave him disabled. A great idea and I would help you, but the truth is that violence generates violence. Well yes... Dad, I'm very interested in the problem with human rights. This is our problem. The director always wants to ignore. Always. Ace that interests you, you have to start reading. You have to understand, what they are. If you promise me to go, I'll give you a pass for a conference on human rights I promise Dad, I really promise. I have one ... Oh, he's from UDO. - Yes. "The School Democratic Organization invites you to a conference student rights. " Thanks, Dad. Do you see who is there? Bring her. I'll tell you what we're gonna do. Come on, friend. - All right. Hello, Angela. I love to make it on ice. He wants you to go there. I wont go, What about this? Did you cut off, did you see? Are you kidding? No one repels me, at least this cow! Mom. Mom, wake up Matthew ... I'm tired. I came home later, letting me rest Mom, I told you, you have me today meeting at school. Dad will take us every moment. What time is it? It's seven hours. Seven? No, I can not believe it. I have a very important meeting with my boss- How could I succeed ?! Hello. And your mother? We'll be late. She will not come. It has to work. No, how is it possible? Let's go. Well, on the prom with the prom ... I want to tell you that the students must cover the fee for the party it is $ 175 per student. and an additional $ 20 for an escort. Yes, Mateo? Barbara, sorry I interrupt you No problem. - All right. Are not there any other offers? I think this is very expensive. I do not know, we can find another place, where is cheaper? This is an event that already is organized, Mateo. It does not seem fair ... ... because we have to think about the capabilities of our parents. Do not worry if it's money, I'll find them ... Dad, it's not about money ... it is about justice. We, as students, have the right of opinion. They did not even allow us to see the place. I understand, Mateo, but that's not the way for discussion, nor the way you do it. If you excuse me, I will leave, so that you can decide, how it can be better organized. Excuse me. Do not worry, let's go to talk to ... Did you see how she left us? to hang out here? She's really rough, Daddy. - No, son. It's rude. At least now we can get up. What? - Let's get out of here. Yes, well. Bye. - Until recently. Bye. Oh, this boy Mateo ... if you wanted to participate ... why not do it earlier? - This boy is a problem. I would have more students like Matteo. What did you say, Bibiana? Yes, students have the right to express themselves free yourself, to express their opinion, to be unique and should not be penalized for that. Bibiana's comment is interesting ... because you ought to know, that in this school equires the most rigorous discipline and most respectful to teachers and staff. If you do not like it, you can leave. when you decide when it suits you. I quit... because I can not continue working with this way of education. Do not worry, the year is over and then look for an institution that is ... closer to education, which you prefer. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! See who we have here. The little fat rebel, who does not want to talk to me. Enough, Lucas. Let me go. I did not do anything to you! No? - No! You ignore me, what is it then? I wanted to talk to you normally, but after you did not want .... ... we will do it the hard way. What are you doing? Stop it! No! No! No! Ready, bro. I shot him. This is to understand, that nobody ignores me. If you only think about it to someone else for that I swear, this video goes directly on the Internet.. No! Stop it! Let me go! Morning, class. Good morning. Well, before we start the day today, I want to give each one a flyer. This is an invitation for an excursion with one overnight stay. Well thank you. - Let's see it. Give your classmates. Thanks. Ines ... Ines, less than a month ago we had to pay for an excursion. Do we still have to pay? Look, Mateo, that's totally different. We go on an excursion, we actually go camping. The presence of everyone is obligatory and you have to have fun. But if Mateo does not like it, could talk to the director. And I repeat, presence is a must. Whoever decides not to come, will come to school on Saturday. Why will we come on Saturday? Do not even joke with that. Besides, there we will be without parents. Have fun with friends. I think it's a great idea. Of course. No, guys, guys. Let's not walk. They want us money for that. All this money is not fair, is it? A! Then do not come, brother. Nobody is forcing you. We're going to have a great time, are not we? Yes. - Of course. Mateo, stop wasting your time. Who would like to study on Saturday? Let's go and have a great time. Yes, it would be better if I went. Ours are still quarreling and hard to hold at home. Stop! Raise the tents here. Go to the river if you want. Here it is. - You serious? What is it, Pamela? - I'm coming! Mateo! I want to show you something. Come on! Come on! We wanted to talk to you privately. Lorena and I like you a lot. I will leave you alone, so you can talk. Wait wait. I do not know how to kiss. Are you serious? - Yes. Pamela? Where's Matteo? Matteo? Matteo will come after a while. I asked him for a favor and he will come back soon. Hey, Gabriel! Or rather, Gabi. Show us our little tits, if you have them at all. Idiot! What? Will you cry? Guys, let's do a review! Go! Well done! Someone else. You! Angela, Angela! And the winner is ... I! And now, someone else. Lorena! Well, what's up, Mateo? Did you like it? What he did with Lorena. А? I saw everything. It hurt me a lot. Many. Matteo ... I do not like women ... ...I like you. I am in love. Oh! "That's really news, Mom. Yes ... and this is not just someone. I can imagine. Who is the happy girl? He is not a woman. Are you ready. Come to have breakfast. I do not want breakfast today. Your room is always arranged and organized. Oh, these are the books your father has did you buy? "Around the World in 80 Days" by Jules Verne, "Mary" by Jorge Isaac, Albert Einstein? Oh dear ... "Open Roads" is not a children's book. This is my favorite book. Dad said I can read it. Let's have breakfast. I do not want breakfast. Relax. Is that fine? Do not be stubborn. It is for your own good. And my dad lives elsewhere for my own good? Look, I ... I think, that everything will be fine. I want Dad to be here, next to me. Well, I promise. I'll talk to your mother. Please tell her ... that I really want Dad to come back. Okay ... Let's go. It will ... cool the tea. Are not you going to say anything, Mom? I do not know what to say, Mateo. I did not expect such news. Hello. Excuse me. Hello my love. Yes, Mateo, yes. Well, yes, what I told you ... How are you a son? - We'll talk later, bye. Hello ... Hello, Dad. How is it going? Okay ... Okay, Dad. Everything is fine. Is the school okay? Do you write your homework? Yes of course. I even write one right now. It's getting better every day - Who was he talking to? С.... With someone I like, Dad. Many. Oh, really? Ah You! Really? Are you in love? Oh ... yeah. Yes, Dad, yes. It is.. This is a very special person. Gladys! Gladys! - Father... Gladys! What's wrong? Look! Daniel is in love. Really, honey? How nice. And who is she? Is he a good family? In which church do they go? I know... - We'll have lunch on Saturday we will invite the girl and we will meet her parents. Clearly. - What about this? What do you think? And Danny, you and I have to talk about ... Yes, Dad, yes ... Danny ... Well, how about this? Every human being has the right an irrevocable right to live freely, without oppression and have the opportunity fully to develop your personality. Here you can leave your information Great, here's a pen. Jimena, how are you? Matteo, what a surprise! What a pleasure. How are you? - All right. I would like to introduce you to Santiago. This is Mateo, the boy who helped me to plant a tree in the school, that I told you about. Yes I remember. Nice, Mateo. Nice to meet you. I'm Santiago. And we help Jimena get it justice in the case of her son. Okay, let's hope, because Your speech was very good. I'm glad you liked it. Thanks. Jimena, can I register? - Yes, here we go ... Write your name, ID card and a phone number. And your signature is legible, please. Why do you wear these earrings? I'm very sorry, but you broke school regulations. You have to talk to the director. . No! we made it clear Gabriel Rosas ... ... that he must adhere strictly the rules for school uniform, how to wear the uniform, as is the case with the rules. Men need to dress like men ... ... and women to dress like women. It is forbidden to wear accessories of women of men and vice versa. Gabriel Rosas will be punished but a week and if caught again we'll have to turn it off. I think it's clear to everyone. Punished to wear earrings? We must have freedom to express ourselves Yes correct. We must not be reconciled to this. But next week everything will be different How? Will you judge the director? Can you imagine? But it will soon beyou bust everything. Oh, what a mystery! As long as you decide whether to tell us, I have an invitation. What? Several friends of Gabriel playing in a gay bar. To go. - The entrance is free. Just them and us, what do you say? Yes, let's go. - Come on, it 's free. Oh, Angela, what is that face? I do not like this plan. Come on! It's free. Angela, you have to come. - Come on. Do not let them worry you. Okay, nice, I'll come. - Yes! But I have some bad news. We can not bring alcohol, because we are minors Oh, that's enough. Please guys. Coupon without alcohol is not a coupon! See how you will or else I do not come. Well nice - do not come. Hello guys and girls. How are you? Did not you recognize him? I am, Gabriel. do you know how much it costs. Hello guys and girls. How are you? See what I brought, to be glad. Who wants a little? - We can not drink here. It's just a drink, we're having fun. Who wants a little? I want. No, Angela, we are minors. Oh, please, people, once a year does not hurt. I want too. Oh, you, Mateo, will not you drink? We can bring him a baby bottle.

Come on. - I do not want, leave me alone Let's go. What's happening? - I'm very sick ... Let's go to the toilet. No no no.. No! - Observe the door! No no no! No no no! What you need is to organize a protest. It must be a strong protest. The first thing you have to do is to distribute flyers on human rights. Of course, teachers do not have to to understand, that you are the organizer. Second, draw graffiti on the walls, on the doors of the toilets, in classrooms. Really cool- . Ladies. Thanks. - Enjoy it. Very nice of you. Do you know what the problem is? I'm sick. I'm sick of yours attitude, Mateo. First flirting with Lorena: "She's a very beautiful girl," And now you're flirting with Pamela's friend. OK. - Fool! Let's go. - This guy is Santiago. Oh, this boy? - Well, Santiago is .. Santiago is the president of the UDO. It only helps me to plan the end of Barbara's injustice. Did you finished? - Oh, you fool, you're jealous! I do not want to fight with you. I do not want to lose you. Only you are me. I would not change you to anyone or for nothing. Look at me. I'm completely yours. What a fool! Are you happy? - No. You're such a fool. Let's go. Hello Aunt. Lucas, where was he? Lucas, where was he? What happened to you? Oh, no problem. It happened, That Walter was running his nose and ... I helped him and that happened. But that's nothing. Nothing has happened. Soak it in warm water. Yes Madam. See you tomorrow. If someone is to blame, this is the director? And in the case of Francisco, Jimena's son? Of course, my friend. Everything, absolutely everything is her fault. We heard stories that she did the same and with other students. With me. Santiago I have always been a victim of her insults. You are one of us. You see, brother. In UDO ... ... we tell students, how to hold on to their rights. I think this is very good. Of course, Santiago, I want to be part of the UDO, because it is time for justice. Of course. You are welcome! - All right Boys! Coming Juan Carlos! Do you think we saw you guys? Hey! Matteo, how is it? All right. What do you give away? I do not give anything away. Are you sure? What evidence do you have? Do not answer me with a question. I ask here! Are you sure? Yes I am sure. Search for it, Juan Carlos. You can not search me! Or I will judge you for disrespect of my personal space. No one is disrespectful. Stop being cynical. Look, you can not break my student rights. I told you not to be cynical and go to class. Did you hear or did not hear? Then he did. Excuse me, I have an hour. - Go on. Madam, what you tell me sounds very strange to me. Yes, I understand, Angela has been like that for days. When he comes home and locked in his room. He does not want to talk to anybody. He does not want to talk to anybody. I find this very odd. Let me talk to Angela. I will also talk and with other teachers to see if they know anything. Oh, please, I would really appreciate this. Everyone is here. Hello girls. How are you. - Hello, fine. Angela, I was looking for you. Can it be a minute? Excuse me, girls. Sit down. Angela, I'm a little worried about you. I've seen you in school lately less closed. You look depressed. Normally you're a very cheerful girl, very happy. In fact, your mother told me that at home you are very sad, you stopped talking. I want to know what's wrong. Did something happen? You know you can tell me, if anything happened. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Lucas. Excuse me for interrupting you. - Say ... Later, I now see, that you're busy with Angela. I just wanted to show you something, but ... ... no, maybe later. Bye. - All right, Lucas. Goodbye Angela, what's wrong? WE CALL FOR YOUR RIGHTS REVOLUTION See what a thick dick .... Better keep silent, if you do not want... upload the video on the Internet. ... and tell everyone that you ... ... gave me my virginity. WE CALL FOR YOUR RIGHTS WE HAVE BEEN HOMOSEXUAL THIS SCHOOL DOES NOT DEAR STUDY RIGHTS We gathered you here .... ... because there is a serious problem ... ... with what we found written in the men's toilet. It seems that from education, what we give you here ... in this school, no benefit. And I want to understand it too clearly ... And I want to understand it too clearly ... And it will have serious consequences ... ... for those who are guilty for these acts of vandalism, ... for those who are guilty for these acts of vandalism, Angela, daughter, opened the door. Angela, open the door immediately? Angela, open the door immediately? Angela, why do not you open the door? Open it! Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela! Alvaro Rios? - Here. Alvaro Rios? - Here. Angela ... Angela Kareno is not here? Did anyone see it? Boys and Girls, how are you Hello. Can we talk? - Yes We're back in a minute. Complete silence, please. Let's see. No no no.. The important thing is that it did not happen within the school it did not happen in the school. This relieves us of responsibility and nothing happened here. This relieves us of responsibility and nothing happened here. and a girl she has reached of your life. And do you think nothing happened? No, Bibiana, you're just ... - True.. Her mother comes last week. Her mother comes last week. I know that. "Of course, I spoke to Angela and she did not say anything to me, so it was hard to do something. Is it clear now? Here, on the territory of the school, nothing happened! What happened to Angela is too big. The bad thing is that no one does not take responsibility. She looked bad lately, but he did not say anything to any of us. I think it's all Lucas's fault. Yes, do you see, he harasses her constantly. Speaking of it, see who is there. Ma ... Matteo, but ... Its your fault. - What are you talking about? Because of you, Angela wanted it to commit suicide. How do I know what that whale has done? Mateo! Mateo! - Watch out, Mateo! Stop it, Lucas! Release it! Leave it, Lucas! I am very surprised to see you here. You always travel. True. I had to postpone a trip, when you called me. As you can see, the situation with Matteo is difficult. We noticed that Mateo is a boy who ... which is very lush, who protests for everything. He is not happy with anything at school. And honestly, neither my team nor me we found a way to communicate with him correctly. I do not understand what you are talking about. Matteo is an excellent student and he has high ratings, right? This is true and can not be doubted. But tell me, what does it matter, if the estimates are good, but as a person, is there much to be desired? Probably provoked him? No, Mateo? Yes mom. Lucas always harasses me. Not only me, but everyone else. Anna, I will tell you this very honestly. You need to find another school and move it. What are you talking about, Barbara? This is his last year, he is going to graduate. I understand the difficulties, but if Matteo stay here, will be on probation and will have to have daily sessions with our psychologist. It is your decision. We can not afford it to continue ... We have to raise all the students protest ... to seek their students' rights. What do you think? I do not think that's a good idea, Mateo. Our graduation is forthcoming. It is not worth creating more trouble. Matteo, Mateo ... Yes, rely on me for everything. Matteo, you know you can rely on me. But ... you have to think about it. Hear Pamela, the school is almost over Definitely, do not count me. Here's what this country is about never progresses. I do not want to talk to you anymore. I can not believe it, Mateo. I just came up with a problem and now you want a new one. What Barbara did, was it fair? She gave me a probationary period, Mom. I know ... And I do not think it's fair. But she is a director and can do, whatever he wants. Uh-oh. No! Mommy, there are laws the constitution and the human do. Having power does not mean, that he can break through that he wants. You know what? You know what? I've always been on your side. - Then help me. Will you do it? Come here. Good morning my love. I came to say good-bye because I'm going. What do you want me to bring you? I do not want you to go anywhere. Matteo ... we've talked about it many times You know the trips are part of my work. But Mom, you're traveling for the third time this month. To know. But somebody has to pay the bills in this house. Your father does not help much, does he? Helps. He may have no money, but .. he gives me of his time, which is more valuable than money. Yes, you are right. Look at me. I know time is more valuable than money. but we can not pay the bills in this house with time. Mum, with you - it's all about money everything is just money. Come here. Will not you kiss me for goodbye? Matteo? Matteo? You are pathetic! I'm sorry, but today you are very beautiful. Right? I am very beautiful today? I want to beat you to Lucas head. The only boy I like is a mate, so get away from me. It turns out Lorena likes gay boys. Do not you know Mateo and Daniel are lovers " Everyone here knows it. I do not believe it. You always try to make people to smooth out badly. You're wrong. Honey, open your eyes. Look around and judge only. We took action ... ... against Lucas Gomez. a student in this school, because my daughter Angela ... ... he confessed to me that he had forced her sexually. This boy raped her. We look forward to your institution to help us and give support- I can not believe, that Lucas has done so. This situation is very delicate. Everything's fine, dear. She would not like the headmaster. And this institution too will be affected. Ready. Boys and girls, for the next hour I want to bring me an essay on 'Crime and Punishment', by whom? Dostoevsky. - Very good. This is considered one of the masterpieces of Russian literature. I want the essays for the next hour. Walk and rest. Thanks, Miss. I do not have much time.

I'm not born to follow others .... impose on me what to do. The music that makes the radio stations the artists the industry is pushing ... movies that the market is pushing ... The political ideas that few want everyone to follow. I was born to solve myself. Why did I appear in this world? I came to make a difference. And I will do it for you, Daniel. I will become a political act. quite alone. So people like you, like Gabriel ... like Angela, like Lorena, like Pamela, like all boys and girls from our school can spread wings.

That's the way. But for me, they were trampled and broken. I still dream to change something. and it will become a reality, when you read this. иand I will not have more of this world. I will change this world ... with an act that will make everyone to pay attention. Something deep inside me tells me, I'm right. Did the fate interfere with losing any hope? I do not know. What is important is that I will fly. Do you know? Like the green butterflies, who appeared when I was a child, those I saw, and those who have me have formedit was still a child. At last I will dissolve my wings and I'll get out of my cocoon. I will dissolve my wings and become big. I will be someone, something. I will stop searching and I will be master of your fate. When you finish reading my letter .. ... I believe I will fly. This is the moment I chose to talk, on behalf of those without a vote. I'll fly to get the others out from your cocoon and see the light. Daughter, daughter ... Mom ... TO MY PARENTS No! No! No... Mom ... What is this? - No, Mom. Sir. Stop, sir! Stop it! Stop it!
