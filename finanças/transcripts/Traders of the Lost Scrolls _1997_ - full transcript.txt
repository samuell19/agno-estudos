(mellow techno music) (reel whirring) - [Narrator] 1947, a hoard of ancient documents is discovered in caves on the shores of the Dead Sea. Scrolls dating back 2,000 years that will come to be recognized as among the most important archeological finds of the 20th Century. But before their true value is realized, they pass through the hands of Bedouin, traders, scholars, and collectors. Some traveling as far as the United States. - [Announcer] Archbishop Athanasius Samuel, metropolitan of Jerusalem, opens the letter scrolls of the 2000 year old biblical texts. A 1000 years older than any previously known. - [Narrator] 50 years later, despite every attempt to bring all the scrolls to light. Rumors persisted there are more out there. Adding to the mystery and controversy that surrounded these writings for the last five decades. For those who deal in Dead Sea scrolls who deal with the secrets they hold, the story is far from over. (dramatic music) (indistinct radio chatter) - [Radio Host] Jersey city 65 (indistinct radio chatter) (relaxed jazz music) - [Narrator] Princeton, New Jersey site of one of America's prestigious Ivy league colleges. This is home to professor James Charlesworth An academic who has become a manuscript detective. He has brought to light over 4,000 ancient documents so far. James Charlesworth is also an expert on the Dead Sea scrolls. As head of Princeton's Dead Sea scroll project. He's examined many of the recovered manuscripts and thousands of individuals scroll fragments but he's convinced that there's more to this story. As the picture isn't yet revealed. - I do not believe the greatest discovery has yet been made. We haven't got all of the scrolls. We haven't translated all of them. There are literally dozens of scrolls that we haven't yet been able to piece together. What do they have to tell us? Now, remember when you're putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle and that's what we're doing, trying to reconstruct the past. When does that piece fit, which all of a sudden you have the picture. (car door closes) - [Narrator] For professor James Charlesworth, the search for scrolls is more than a job, it's a passion. - [James] I thought we would start with the question, what are the Dead Sea scrolls? - [Narrator] But he's equally committed to interpreting scrolls already discovered. - The Dead Sea scrolls are 2000 years old, not only biblical scrolls but also previously unknown documents. They're coming from the dark ages in the history of Western culture. A historical gap of over 200 years. Jesus, he lived exactly in this period of silence and his boy, how did our culture take shape? Whether were talking about our culture, Western culture. We talking about Judaism or we talking about Christianity. We're talking about the same thing. How did all this stuff get started? - [Narrator] For Charlesworth the Dead Sea scrolls may hold the key. - [James] Hey John. - [Narrator] And the answers could throw doubt on beliefs held over many centuries. - How's the alignment, can you get the sheens in line so? - The alignment is going really well all the final corrections- - [Narrator] At Princeton, Charlesworth works on scrolls weighing the evidence and publishing his conclusions. But he also inhabits another world. The Twilight world of scroll trading. For if there are more scrolls out there and Charlesworth is convinced there are. Then he wants to be the first to make a bid for them. - I have absolutely no doubt that there are hundreds of fragments out there and whole scrolls. There are individuals extremely wealthy, probably billionaires who've purchased these for one reason or another and they have fragments. There are fragments in the homes of lawyers and Bedouin and other individuals in Israel today. I do know that there are four scrolls in Amman and Damascus. - [Narrator] Charlesworth knows that many of his leads will go nowhere but it's a risk he has to take. - I am criticized for going after something that's not there but I have seen fragments of the Dead Sea scrolls turned to dust. I've seen other fragments turned to water because they're so fragile. It's important for me to get them before they disappear. They have never been seen for 2000 years but we have to find them before they decay. - [Narrator] Charlesworth is not alone in believing that the truth is still out there. In the Judean wilderness that stretches Southeast of Jerusalem, other scroll hunters are on the trail. - In order to find another cave in the limestone. We need a good earth, I mean, that's what we need. It's very hard, I mean, you can look at those cliffs and see that there's, you know, a lot of piles of stones and you know, underneath every pile of stone there is a chance to find another cave. - [Narrator] Hannen Ashel is an archeologist who continues to scar the cliffs on the Northwestern shore of the Dead Sea. Here, the first scrolls were discovered 50 years ago. - Sometime in the summer of 1947 three Bedouins were climbing up this cliff. And what they found was this cave. Those two entrances were blocked. And the only entrance which was open is this small one. And over there, the jars were standing and one of the Bedouins Muhammed (indistinct). He told us that altogether, he found eight jars. Six of them were empty, one of them was full with soil. And then the last one, he found three complete scrolls. Now he took out his three scrolls and some of the jars and went down the cliff, back to his tent. He showed it to his cousin and they started to excavate. Here they found another four scrolls. So altogether seven scrolls were found by the Bedouins here in 1947. - [Narrator] Those first scrolls passed quickly into the hands of a Bethlehem merchant, Khalil Eskander Shahin better known as Kando. Suspecting they might be of value, Kando purchase the scrolls from the Bedouin and started looking for buyers himself. The trade in Dead Sea scrolls had begun. When the Bedouin realized that scrolls meant money, they began to hunt in earnest. As desert dwellers they knew where to look and unearth many more scrolls than the archeologists who were to join the search. In that first decade, the remains of over 800 manuscripts were found in 11 caves. To stop the trade in scrolls and prevent them vanishing again from history. An international team of scholars based in Jerusalem tried to buy the thousands of fragments that came on the market. Although they hope they'd stop the traffic. They had no way of being seen. But who actually wrote the scrolls? Whose story did they tell, and why where they hidden? As the discovery and trading of scrolls accelerated. Archeologists began excavating the ruins of an ancient settlement called Qumran. Just a mile away from the cave where the first scrolls were discovered. - In this room, long tables and short one and tree quilts were found, one from metal the rest from pottery and finding tree and the tables together. Point up to the point that some of the scrolls were probably copied in this room. - [Narrator] Evidence began to suggest that the people who lived here had been the keepers of the Dead Sea scrolls. Archeologists were convinced they had hidden their scrolls in nearby caves just before their community was destroyed by Roman legions in 68, AD. For 2000 years the caves kept their secrets. Protecting a legacy from the most formative years of both Judaism and Christianity. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Back in the United States, James Charlesworth is setting out on another journey in search of missing links in the Dead Sea scrolls. (upbeat music) His final destination the Middle East. But first it's a long detour to Norway, chasing scrolls is a global pursue. - I really find it kind of mystical to be out in this part of the world. So far removed from the so-called Holy land. Looking for remanence of Jewish writings from the time of Jesus. - [Narrator] Somewhere near Oslo, Charlesworth is following up a lead that a private collector has scrolled fragments in his possession. - Martin Skoin is extremely wealthy, man. And now he dedicated his life to acquiring ancient manuscripts including the Dead Sea scrolls. There is a, the dream that he will have some significant fragments and they'll help us put together the massive jigsaw puzzle of the community that preserved and copied the Dead Sea scrolls and giving us information data that has revolutionized our understanding of how it all began and how we got where we are now. - [Narrator] James Charlesworth knows that missing pieces can lead him down two different historical trails. Writings that reflect the life of the people of Qumran and tell him about the first century or the biblical documents they collected and copied can reveal how the Bible has developed over more than 2000 years. Skoin turns out to have both, tiny pieces of three of the first scrolls found in cave one, which he bought from two of the earliest scroll scholars. - [James] Is this a fragment of Daniel? - This is of Daniel, yes, and it is actually written in the lifetime of Christ and the apostles. And when you look at it, with visible light it comes from Qumran and it's the earliest complete manuscript. It is very important to get them published. - [Narrator] Skoin reveals how one of his pieces fits into a small corner of the scroll jig saw puzzle. - I had put this type of fragments into its context here where it belongs. - [James] It certainly does look like it fits there. - [Narrator] But on the whole these fragments are too small to be a big help to Charlesworth. - It's a pity, there's not more that you could see more writing. - Well, that's what we have preserved from the first column. - [Narrator] Although, there's no major breakthrough here. Charlesworth is heartened to find a collector with a wide knowledge of ancient manuscripts has reinforced his conviction, but other scrolls will be found somewhere in the Middle East. - Skoin is convinced that there are maybe cigar boxes full of fragments in the hands of Bedouin. - [Narrator] Charlesworth needs collectors like Skoin. They can afford to buy lost scrolls which he can then study, but it's different. - [James] The prices of scrolls have skyrocketed to the point that many people are not interested in playing the game because the prices are way out of line. And I think when the prices come down, then these individuals who have scrolls probably would be able to find someone to help them. - [Narrator] On his travels, Charlesworth has found that different collectors have different motives. - [James] Now, one reason is this very lucrative. You buy a scroll or a fragment for maybe $10,000. And if you're lucky, maybe you sell it for $200,000. Another reason as you become very important, you have power. And in many circles, the most powerful person is the one who has something that you want. (upbeat music) (car brakes screeching) - [Narrator] While James Charlesworth travels towards the Middle East. Professor Larry Shiffman of New York University comes with the subject in a totally different direction. - I'd say that what I am is not so much a hunter for scrolls but a hunter for what's in the scrolls. I've devoted more or less my entire career to trying to understand what the scrolls really say about the very, very important period those years before the split between Judaism and Christianity those years before what I guess we could say are the creation of Western religion, as we know it. - [Narrator] Larry Shiffman is a member of the editorial team that continues to translate and interpret the Dead Sea scrolls. Making sense of what's already been discovered. This difficult process of putting together the jig saw puzzle of reconstructing the scrolls is taking decades to complete because of its complexity. - [Larry] Imagine that you had a New York Times, let's say and you took only 10 of its pages and then rip them up and then took 10% of what was on the floor. And now you try to get a sense, what is the New York Times? That's really the boat we're in with the Dead Sea scrolls. - [Narrator] In the years that followed their discovery. The daunting task of piecing together 50,000 fragments slowed down the publication process. By the 1970s, it had almost ground to a halt. This frustrated many scholars who weren't allowed access and even provoked conspiracy theorists. But the scrolls might hold secrets damaging to Christianity. - For a whole variety of reasons the original team, after they assembled the jigsaw puzzle was not able to get it published. Now, these reasons included illness, alcoholism, death, lack of interest, Israeli Arab politics. Finally, really what happened was that there was so much pressure to get this thing published. The assignments were given out again. And I would say that by 1991, we were really on the way to getting the material published as it should be. (typing on keyboard) - [Narrator] With the scrolls out in the open. Shiffman is now challenging a widespread assumption that they are only important because of what they say about the origins of Christianity. As a Jewish scholar, he sees the scrolls as essentially Jewish documents throwing light on Jewish history. - [Larry] You don't just enlighten a small group of weirdos who went off to the desert and stuck some ancient books in a cave for us to find them. They enlightened us about the whole nature of the Judaism of the period. That's why I'm so excited about them. - [Narrator] From their writings. It appears that the people who wrote the scrolls were a group of Jewish dissidents fed up with the establishment of their day, who left Jerusalem to set up their own set. - Now, many scholars use the term (indistinct) to describe the set, but the truth of the matter is. That we really cannot identify with certainty, which set that was or what group that was, that left us the Dead Sea scrolls. Like Qatar- - [Narrator] From his work on the scrolls Larry Shiffman has been able to enter the minds of the people behind the texts. The mysterious community who lived at Qumran 2000 years ago. - [Larry] We know they devoted much of their time praying and studying as they did for one third of every night of the year. And the results of their study of God's law. As enshrined in the Bible were basically enshrined in their texts. - [Narrator] Although Shiffman's work is mainly in the study in the classroom he's not averse as some real scroll hunting himself. - I've been contacted on several occasions and followed up leads that went nowhere. And I know others have done the same for some reason whenever you start to get close enough, that money is starting to be on the table. The elusive scrolls usually disappear off the face of the earth so I'm wondering if those scrolls really exist I'm pretty doubtful, but again, you never know. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Sustained by his belief that there are more scrolls to be found. James Charlesworth continues his journey. His next stop, Jordan's capital, Amman. (upbeat music) - [James] Now, how does one continue in this task of looking for scrolls or looking for fragments? You, first of all listen, get to know people. And pretty soon you learn, you hear things. There are of course circles in which you hear about basketball or cricket and other circles in which you hear about scrolls and they rumors that, hey if you heard that and you follow that up and low and behold every now and then you find out, I cannot believe what we have found today. (slow-paced Middle East music) - [Narrator] On this trip, Charlesworth's contacts point him south into the desert to Petra. - [James] Petra, it was a magnificent trading center where the Dead Sea scrolls were being copied. I'm eager to meet some of the Bedouin whom I've been talking to you for about 15 years. There may be some information there and perhaps even more than information that I need to check out. (footsteps receding) - [Narrator] Although many leads will turn out to be dead ends. Charlesworth is convinced that every rumor, however vague needs to be pursued. - [James] Beyond the fragments I have no doubt that there are real scrolls, full scrolls, lengthy scrolls, well over 20 feet long. That are in this area and they're moving them out and they're not in the hands of Bedouin's. But through the Bedouin's I can get fragments and get words about what this other material is. - [Narrator] Here the Bedouin is still acting as archeologists still digging, as they had done in Qumran several decades. And the record shows that it's the Bedouin who are the people most likely to know the whereabouts of any new discoveries. - [James] I am a professor at Princeton and I have been here in Petra five times, - [Man] Welcome. - The Bedouin is from Qumran. They come to Petra. - Sometimes. - Sometimes. - Sometimes. - You speak the same language. - Caravan. - Caravan. - They make caravan. - What do they bring with them? - Bring some (indistinct), some eat, some salt, from Dead Sea, you know. - Antiquities they bring some antiquities? I know that, they have told me they bring antiquities. Have you seen antiquities come over? - [Man] This, this story before my own life. Before my life, this is all the story. - [James] Ah, yeah. - [Man] Not my life. - [James] Earlier. - [Man Yeah. - [James] If you hear of anything, let me know. - [Narrator] This first meeting hasn't yielded any immediate results but that's not unusual. Getting information from Bedouin is a long process of gaining trust. And in the turbulent world of Middle Eastern politics and culture, Charlesworth has to tread cautiously. - [James] See, it's very hard to sift this out because the last thing the Palestinian Bedouin would want would be to let them get in the hands of the people they claim are their enemies. So we're in this turmoil of who do you believe? And if they really had material, why would they ever give it to me or to a Westerner? That's a different culture, they don't want their enemies to benefit so I really don't know. I was a little frustrated from Petra. We didn't get what I had hoped to from that area. (upbeat music) - [Narrator] While Charlesworth continues his search for lost scrolls. Back on the shores of the Dead Sea the hunt for documents still in caves goes on. It's a quest that has been pursued ever since the original discovery in 1947. Since then the desert has yielded, not just Dead Sea scrolls but manuscripts dating from before the Qumran period up to the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Romans in the early second century. 30 years ago the desert seemed to have given up the last of its treasures. - After 65, no more documents were found not only by scholars but by veterans as well. Now, when I started doing my research, the people told me look, there's no more chance veterans found everything. There's no more documents in the desert. There's no reason to excavate it more cave. In 1986, we enter a cave West of Jericho. And in this cave, first of all, we found guns that were hidden there probably after the six day war. And then we excavated the cave and we found six documents from the Bar Kokhba period, one document, which is earlier from the Persian period in the same cave. In 93, we found 30 documents lying outside the cave. So it happened to me twice, once in 86, another time in 93, where I'd found documented as you then did. - [Narrator] In 1996, an attempt to uncover more Qumran documents led Hannen Ashel to try to find a link between the community and cave one. The original scroll cave, a mile or so to the North. - I said, let's start from the site. Let's see if I can find the trail leading from the site to cave one and two. Now, while I was walking here I found those very nice trails leading to this area. And when I came here I was shocked to see that there's cave hill, nobody recorded them. They're not being mentioned in any of the reports. So in 1996, together with McGinn (indistinct) the creator of The Shrine of the Book we excavated here. And in those two caves, when we got to the floor, we got we found hundreds of body shirts and rooms of pottery vessels including cooking pots, storage jars and dishes and oil lamps. All of them were in those two caves. So I think that I can safely say that those two caves we use for habitation. People lived here during the first century. - [Narrator] Charlesworth pursuit of the Bedouin connection takes him from Petro to Bethlehem. Where the scrolls originally appeared for sale. To a rendezvous with a man who claims to be the legendary Mohammed (indistinct) the Wolf, who found the first cave containing scrolls. (speaking foreign language) - You were a shepherd before you found the Dead Sea scrolls, how did you life change? - [Translator] They sold the scrolls. Impressive people started to talk of the scrolls, that Bedouin had found were fetching this much and that much. We sold them for £16 but they were worth millions. So we started searching properly, it was worth it. We'd find stuff and bring it to the museum. - [James] Have you looked for other caves? - [Translator] Lots, we worked in caves and emptied them completely. There was one cave we worked for one night. A small one, not a big one, we worked for a short while. And found a piece of metal, with nothing written on it. But the Jordanian Army saw us and started firing at us. And we ran away, and that was that. - Would you take me to see that cave? - [Translator] I'll show you, why not? (slow-paced Middle East music) - [James] I'm Very excited, does he have a cave? And is there any connection between this cave and the caves of Qumran? That would be very exciting even if we don't find a writing in it. To find a connection would be to me just very, very exciting. (slow-paced Middle Eastern music) (foot steps stamping) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (dramatic music) This is good signs we've got some pottery here, some ancient pottery and you can see it goes down pretty deep here. People have lived in this cave. (footsteps stamping) Curious if this goes somewhere it looks like it's been filled up. Then I wonder what's in there beyond there. I can see back into this crevice, maybe 15 or more feet. It looks like a place where some things have been hidden at one time, maybe robbed by Bedouin or it has an interesting story to tell that's for sure. Was it a place for hiding scrolls when the Qumran (indistinct) fled from the Romans. (footsteps stamping) That's a good question. Here's another little crevice is very interesting, isn't it? That goes up a long way, it looks very much like many of the crevices in which Dead Sea scrolls had been placed. Well, there's no question, this has been inhabited. Wonder what story will ever have to tell us over the years? Are we standing now on scrolls, how far down does it go? - [Narrator] Archeologists have visited this cave but it has never been fully excavated. It's impossible to assess the layers of history at a glance. To explore it further he'll have to get a permit. And Charlesworth has every reason to be optimistic. (speaking foreign language) - Exactly what I thought, we have Roman pottery here. (speaking foreign language) So we have clear evidence of occupation in that one cave from the time of Isaiah down to the destruction of the first century. (slow-paced music) - [Narrator] Jerusalem, where much of the drama of the scrolls has been played out over the last 50 years. It's here in the Israel museum Shrine of the Book that the public can see the major scrolls unearthed by the Wolf in 1947. An opportunity that three-quarters of a million people take each year. (speaking foreign language) - [Narrator] But it's in the Rockefeller museum in Arab East Jerusalem away from the public's gaze that the majority of scroll fragments are kept. Here the delicate business of preservation and piecing together still continues half a century after it began. Here scholars can have access to both published and unpublished fragments in their search for what is in the scrolls. In Israel as a New Testament expert, Charlesworth is particularly interested in how Christianity took shape and how the unique writings of the Qumran community can enlighten him. (gate closing) - [James] What was the world like when Christianity began? We really don't know, we used to know. We used to be so clear but now we're so convinced that we were wrong, we know we were wrong. - [Narrator] Charlesworth has requested access to a controversial fragment. It contains a combination of ideas traditionally regarded as unique to Christianity but it was written a century or so before Jesus was born. (gate banging) - Hey, how you doing? - Okay, okay, fine. Here's the plate which you requested. (soft dramatic music) - This is a very exciting fragment for looking at a text the portions of a text that have remained how many little fragments we have. A Jewish document that it's at least 2000 years old. Let's say the century before Jesus. And there are some very precious ideas that have been preserved in the larger piece here referenced to a Mashiach that is Messiah "The Anointed One", God's Messiah. The reference to the resurrection of those who are dead and the believe in this is the end of time. So these three ideas, we take some of the Christian ideas like the coming of the Messiah. Now we can find that in some of these Dead Sea scrolls here is the Messiah who will come. And that becomes very exciting because we now know the coming of the Messiah is not a peculiarly Christian idea or unique to Jesus' followers. We know it as part of the fabric of a very rich culture to me the most advanced culture in terms of symbolisms and religion and spirituality that I've ever seen. And it's out of this, that we're getting little ideas that help us understand big ideas. Christianity, but there's no question none whatsoever to me and to most scholars that are now working in the field. That the origins of Christianity can be felt in these texts in Judaism. Your is a precious, now we can understand Jesus' language in terms of its own time, rather than saying I'll tell you what it means and make it up as we go along, we cannot make it up anymore. We must be dependent upon what the language, what the symbols meant, and Jesus' time. It's a very important way of exploring a dark period in history, the dead sea scrolls then are like the giant flashlight that shines into a lost corridor of history. - [Narrator] It's insights from fragments like these that drive Charlesworth to search for more scrolls and Jerusalem is a good place to do it. Here rumors of hidden scrolls abound. (slow-paced Middle East music) - Just a few days ago a man came to me from East Jerusalem, an Arab, and he said, "We've made contact with some Bedouin who and allegedly hid some scrolls South of here maybe two hours drive South of Jerusalem And they hid scrolls in the earth in an earthern vessel just before or during the six day war." So that would be before 67, so we're kind of running this down you have two possibilities. One is it is a, you know, kind of a wild goose chase. But then there are reasons to think that we better be serious and follow this up. And that's because we have seen fear in the eyes of some of the Arabs and the Arab is involved or showing that they are very scared right now. And that connects not with it being a wild goose chase but there may be something very important here. - [Narrator] The lead takes Charlesworth to the old city and the meeting with an Arab middleman. He hopes to be put in touch with the Bedouins scrolls. (indistinct chatter) - [James] Do you have any idea when they would be here then? (murmmering) - [Man 2] This business it's, you know how it works. I think they also think we (indistinct) - [James] Sure. (murmers) - [James] Exactly. - [Man 2] Because, then we have (mumbles). - [James] That's right, I know what you're talking about. You see this is what we talking about. You could find his corpse and my corpse, that we don't want. (murmmering) - [James] I know exactly, I agree with you. Getting up close to something you didn't even dream. (indistinct chatter) In this whole enterprise you're working with a real danger. There is no way I'm going to be involved in anything like smuggling a scroll out of a country or a fragment out. My principle is very simple where the scroll is or where the fragment is we should try to keep it and find ways to have it preserved. Photograph it so that scholars can learn about it and share what they know with whoever is interested. - [Narrator] In a game where the odds are so high. Smuggling isn't the only danger. - [James] As we search for scrolls, of course people bring us scrolls and sometimes the ink is so wet. You afraid to touch it, obviously we're referring to fakes. I have been looking at scrolls and many of them have turned out to be fakes. You do a study of the leather do a study of the handwriting, but still some of these people are exceedingly gifted in making fakes. So we worked together as a team of scholars and sometimes they are fakes. - [Narrator] Charlesworth's patience pays off. The meeting in the old city. gives him the chance to examine a scroll from the Bedouin, at last. - We have here, the scroll of Esther. That is lined horizontally and vertically, so that Hebrew can be hung on it and written right to left. Precisely as in the Dead Sea scrolls. What's interesting I'm holding the scroll of Esther. The book that we have not yet clearly found among the hundreds of thousands of fragments found in the 11 caves at Qumran, but we're looking for a scroll that's 2000 years old, not 50 years old. This is not an ancient scroll. And that's all the difference in the world. - [Narrator] For Charlesworth, finding Dead Sea scrolls is proving difficult. The same as to have had an actual search in Qumran in 1996. But though no new scrolls were found from his excavations, other ancient objects were. - And it's amazing that in 1996 you still find vessels. So close to Qumran that nobody had found. We start excavating then we realized that we're standing on an area of the tents were built. We found even tent pole that was used there. Most of the members of the Qumran set were living in tents and huts and artificial cave. - [Narrator] As more artifacts are found around the Qumran site. A picture not just of what the community believed but how they lived is coming into focus and more knowledge about the authors means more knowledge about their writings. Estee Ashel, Hannen's wife, is an historian and expert on ancient writing who shares her husband's passion for the scrolls. - We have a good chance to have a look at first hand sources that describes the people Sultan belief and especially this particular interesting group that were in the desert fighting against the establishment and trying to find their own way in life and belief of Judaism. - [Narrator] Her quest to discover the secrets of the people of Qumran is shared by Larry Schiffman. - This was a group which believed that the entire world is divided into two camps. The camp of light, the good guys. And darkness basically the bad guys. And you were predestined to be in one group or the other. They believe that in the end of days, they themselves and all those who would associate with them by coming to see the light basically, by realizing who was right in all this would be saved. Everybody else, Jews and non Jews would die. And the ultimate view of this group. - [Narrator] By combining disciplines, scholars have been able to reconstruct the lives of the people of Qumran. This small group of dissident Jews who abandoned the bright lights of Jerusalem and set up a community in the Hills of Qumran. That would last for over 200 years. They developed a way of life with beliefs and practices that would later be found in early Christianity. And forms of worship and prayer that would eventually influence modern Judaism. Studying for a third of the night and praying as the sun rose and set. They waited for the end of the world. A world which ended for them when the Romans invaded. On the Southern edge of the Qumran site, are three cemeteries where the remains of over 1200 members of the community still lie. - [Estee] You're standing in the middle of a huge graveyard with no name, you have no signs. You don't know what is the name of those people. And I'm spending a big part of my work, trying to figure out their name. - [Narrator] In the winter of 1996 Estee Ashels investigation was helped by the discovery of some writings on a piece of pottery known as an ostracon. - A group of volunteers were cleaning the wall here and they found at the foot of the wall around here two pieces of one ostracon and they took it out and start looking at it and it was 15 lines written in Hebrew script dating to the first century. - [Narrator] It appears to be a form for new members of the community, on it, with the names of a volunteer Holly and a leader, a liaison, real people. As for Hannen Ashel it's the graveyard itself that tells him even more about these people. - All though, the cemetery was not excavated fully. We have only sample of the graves it's is very important data about the nature of the group, because most of the people who were buried here were very young, they died in the thirties. Only one man got to the age of 65. - [Narrator] The ruins of Qumran are slowly giving up their secrets and the young Zealots Jews who had vanished from history are beginning to re-emerge. For the scholars who are bringing them back to life it's a unique experience. - [Hannen] All the people who deals with Qumran scrolls and small community of scholars they taking very seriously every letter that are written in the scrolls. We are basically showing how a group of young people had influenced Christians and Jews the took God in a serious way. And we can learn from their writing about a very interesting period that influence all of us today. - My own feeling about this group is kind of a two-sided double-edged sword. On the one hand, I have tremendous, tremendous respect. For many of their teachings, for their devotion, for the beautiful compositions that they produced, the willingness to sacrifice anything for what they understood as God's way of life. On the other hand, there are really some teachings that are hard to agree with. Like hatred of those who don't agree with you, the feeling that everyone would be destroyed in the end of days. There are aspects here, which are really hard to agree with. (Middle East music) - [Narrator] In the United States. It's the writings of the people of Qumran that are being resurrected in an extraordinary way. Cutting edge technology is being used by high-tech scroll hunters. Doctors Robert Johnston and Roger Easton of Rochester's Institute of technology. And Dr. Keith Knocks of the Xerox research laboratories have been developing a new image processing technique. They believe it will reveal writing on scrolls that has not been seen for 2000 years. Until now the technique has only been tested on photographs. They are very keen to work on actual scrolls. Something that Charlesworth now back in the States may be able to help him with. He knows that just 20 minutes west of New York city in the town of Teaneck. There are Dead Sea scrolls parts of which are unreadable. With the help of this new technology he believes it may just be possible to reveal the lost writings. The fragments arrived here back in 1948 part of a collection brought to America by Jerusalem's then Syrian Orthodox Archbishop Athanasius Samuel. His scroll fragments are now in the care of the Reverend John Mino. - This is just a beautiful liturgical scroll. - [John] This is one of the, one of the fragments that his eminence did keep and he wished to be maintained by the church here. - [James] Let me see the other fragments. - Certainly, there is a second fragment here James that you may want to take a look at. This I believe is from the, from the book of Daniel. - Definitely, you can see the word Daniel here in Hebrew (speaking foreign language) that's beautiful, this writing is so clear, but I'm very curious if we can get some readings into this area where the leather has turned to liquid, liquefaction, where the leather it collapses because of the absorption of a of liquid. And of course we can't see anything in here now with a naked eye but it will be very exciting if we can get some readings there. - [Robert] Okay, go further left, further left. - It works. - [Roger] Well this is, this is- - [Narrator] Using their state-of-the-art camera with a range of wavelengths that far exceeds the human eye. The team convert the Samuel scrolls into digital data. - [Roger] Ready to shoot. - [Narrator] Tension mounts in the room. (camera shutter snaps) There's no way of knowing what the camera will reveal. - [James] Oh my, holy cow! - Look at that. - Unbelievable! - Fantastic. There you go there James, there you go, there's some data. - Unbelievable, unbelievable, look at those, look at that coming out, oh my gosh can we improve this edition? - [Narrator] They can at Rochester, the scrolls now in digital form of being processed by the team. With the help of research assistants, Mitra Mousavi. (indistinct chatter) - The image which shows the writing in both directions, scale them appropriately. (mouse clicks) You will just see the writing in the other grade, perhaps. - Perhaps, or you might see the- - In the first part, you can see that we can separate out some characters with using infrared light. What we're going to look at next is to figure out how to take the jumble of new characters that appears and try and sort them out between what's on this surface? What's on another surface, what's behind the scroll itself? That may be that there are two pieces of a scroll stuck together and we're seeing two images our infrared image for that. - Wait a minute, let's look at this. See we have here the piece of a scroll stuck on top of another scroll. And this gets fascinating to me because this gives an indication of that violent period. When the Romans were taking the area the only way something gets squashed or stuck on this it looks like we're getting it in kind of like a footprint from a violent time. - [Narrator] The most spectacular results come from the application of the new technology to the fragment of (indistinct). Part of the Bible as used and copied by the people of Qumran but this text, Charlesworth is convinced that we are within a generation or so of the original version. Comparison with a modern copy, may raise questions about the accuracy of the Bible in use today. - [Mitra] This is what you were seeing. Turn that around for me won't you, yeah, yes. This is what the, the infrared picture looks like. - Oh my see we have, we can get this line one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. We we've, we've increased this almost double. Prior to this we were working with a document that is basically around a thousand of the common era, but this can take us back way beyond the time of Jesus to about a 100 BC that's within a decade or so, or generation itself of the man who wrote that. And that means we have gone back at least a 1000 years closer. And it's the same thing, the same document except for some minor variations in spelling. - [Narrator] For Charlesworth, this is the end of a journey that has taken him across the world and back again, in order to find treasure in his own back yard. - Even the possibility of, it's like we've discovered a new document or like discovering a new manuscript or another Dead Sea scroll has being found. Found, shall we say technologically because if we find a fragment that has one or two words on it, we're excited, but here we should be ecstatic because we have lines and lines, plus we already know. - It is clear that there's a large number of these scrolls and scroll fragments that have yet to be examined using techniques like this? We're able to get significant improvements in the readability and the legibility of the characters in the scrolls. And we see that large number of scrolls yet to be examined using this technique as something that we could keep us busy for quite a while. - [James] You gave him an idea. (laughing) - [Larry] You could say that the scrolls send us a message across the two millennia. That message for us today, I think, is to understand the extent to which the very (indistinct) nature of Judaism in that period. Gave birth on the one hand for a bit of Judaism, but on the other hand so a whole variety of transmogrification and changes and all this to Christianity as well which teaches that Christianity has its roots in Judaism. And therefore comes to tell us the importance of the kinds of relations between the two groups that we would hope to be there for the future. - [Hadden] There is good reason to continue to look and I'm sure that Cave 12 will be found. I really hope that I will take part in this adventure but if not, I'm willing that everybody else will do it. As long as we have more documents we'll have better data about the people is important. - What about it, am I going to continue to look for scrolls and fragments of scrolls? Absolutely, I'm convinced that there are a lot of fragments out there that may help us understand things that we haven't even asked about. So I shall keep looking as long as I live because I've said repeatedly I think the great discoveries are yet to be made. (upbeat music)
