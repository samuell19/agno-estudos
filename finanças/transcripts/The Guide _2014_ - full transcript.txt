National Film Board of Ukraine In times of tyranny and injustice, singers will arise - those who tell of the times when the people were strong, and proud, and free In the 1930s, the Soviet regime arrested hundreeds of the blind kobzars. They vanished, without a trace a film by Oles Sanin Kharkiv, Ukraine 1934 (In Russian) Go! Hurry up! (In Russian) Go! Hurry up! An adult couldn't fit into the box under the car, only someone as small as I. Back then, I was 13. My real name was Peter Shamrock, but the street punks called me, "The American." In those days a train with prisoners wasn't something unusual. There were thousands of trains packed with people denounced as "enemies of the state". They were taken to Siberia, to labor camps to build roads, factories, power plants, canals - to build a brighter future. But the labor camps had no need for blind musicians, while no one managed to force kobzars sing of "Falkon-Stalin." All my life I searched for the documents, and for other witnesses. Cause no one would ever believe someone like me. The Guide - Comrade Volodymyr! They're the Aoidoses of the Ukrainian nation. Two years earlier Yes, I realize that these mediums are obsolete, but we are scientists. We'll organize a conference We'll develop a methodology, we'll held a congress of kobzars. We'll explain the whole "situation" of the modern times. This way, a truly new, you understand, a new, socialist kobzarship shall emerge. Oh, is that you? What did you want? Here! What is this? Conference, conference Of socialist kobzars. Socialist! Do you understand? All right. To build our future! But, you'll be held accountable. (In Russian, sounding in background) So comrades. I need your attention! Thank you. You've saved them, you saved Ukrainian music! (In Russian, sounding in background) Attention! Do not forget that music is a weapon to control the masses! (In Russian, sounding in background) It should be international in spirit and socialist in substance! All right. (In Russian, sounding in background) Comrades, we are performing for foreigners pre-approved music only so absolutely no improvisations! CINEMA-EYE (Cheerful voice in background) There are crowds of unemployed workers in New York, London and Paris standing in a queue for a bowl of free soup! There the unemployed are standing Whereas the country of Soviets relentlessly moves forward by building the world's first country of workers and peasants. I don't like newsreels, but this one, this one was special. It was about my dad, American engineer Michael Shamrock. My father taught workers in the factory how to build an American tractor. The tractor was called "The International". Everyone here liked that word. Even my school was named after the Third International. With a bowtie? He went that way. Thank you! You're welcome. Big, big building and... (translates it into Ukrainian) - bydynok velykyi New buildings are rising in the cities. This is a tiny part of the work done by the American communist whose efforts have merged seemlessly with the efforts of factory's workers The first tractor that came - Peter, now it's your time to go on stage!... off of the conveyor in the factory is being given to the people of - You should read your poem. the Kalynivka village collective farm. Peter, please stop here, - When you are around, make three steps forward. Okay? And now, for all the participants in this celebration, the son of the American communist comrade Michael Shamrock, fifth-grader Peter Shamrock, will recite a poem about our bright future.

Due to the shameful failure to satisfy bread requisitions in certain parts of Ukraine, we declare: to fight the sabotage, elminate any attempts of obstruciton by party members and to haul away all of food reserves. For his active participation in the assembly of the first tractor, our American comrade Michael Shamrock is rewarded with a trip to Moscow, the world capital of the proletariat. And now, comrades, we are offering a musical number for your attention! Our orchestra will perform a jazz composition. Jazz, comrades, is the music of oppressed American Negro laborers. Olha, I know it's just a formality but you know, Id like to tell you... Why are you starting this conversation again? We've already agreed - just friends. You know I have somebody. Of course, you are a man, too. Volodia, you don't interest me! I love Michael! Bravo! Olha, you won't get permission to marry. Not here, not in Moscow. They'll leave and you'll forget them. My dear friend Gareth Jones I am sending you the documents you've been searching for. Perhaps their publication in your newspaper will stop the killing of innocent people and the destruction of my nation. I remain a Communist and a Ukrainian, Mykola Sytnyk.

(In Russian) Write this down: Michael Shamrock, comrade Michael Shamrock, an American engineer, a communist, who has voluntarily arrived to the counry of Soviets in the Soviet state to develop one of the most important branches of industry — mechanical engineering, was killed by agents of world Imperialism led by the degenerate and just now exposed, the sworn enemy of the Soviet state Nikalai Sytnik. (switches to Ukrainian, cites a poem by Taras Shevchenko) The cherry trees surround the cottage.. If it keeps hurting, find some doth, urinate on it, and put it on your wound. Understand? What? Urinate! Aha... Don't be sad, he might still be alive. You can't return to Kharkiv. Every dog is looking for you there now, better to go to Odessa. What was the name of the ship? Des... Desdemona. Desdemona. Don't get off this train. It goes straight to Odessa, to the sea. Look for the captain of the Desdemona there. The moon has risen, and the new era begins. (In Russian) Keep calm, uncle. (In Russian) The boy doesn't have anyone here. (In Russian) It means he will head to Odessa. (In Russian) He sailed there with his father. (In Russian) He'll look for the ship "Desdemona". (In Russian) Desde-who? (In Russian) Mona. You should read Shakespeare, Myron! Olha, you have visitors! I've read this newspaper, it's about me. Olha Levytska - new star of the Kharkiv theater! Olha, this is tomorrow's edition. Olha, did you really think that Sytnyk would cover for you your whole life? You are a grown-up girl, and should understand that one day the games are over, and then... What happened to Peter? Where is Peter? He disappeared. But I'II find him. I think he was kidnapped by the people who killed his father. Olha, I am the only one who can protect you. Olha, it's your call! Can you read in our language? Yes. Look and see what station it is. Up there aboe the entrance, it should say it. K-k-rasny K-u-ut Krasny Kut. Ok then. I have arrived. Sit quietly and don't get off. You'll get there. If you hear anyone, hide inside the box under the coach an adult won't fit, but it's just right for you, and they won't look there. Bye, little one! (In Russian) Do you have a photo? (In Russian) Yes! Here, printed from the newsreel. (In Russian) Are the precincts notified? (In Russian) Everyone's notified! (In Russian) Where would he go, right? (In Russian) The boy doesn't know the language, doesn't know the roads. (In Russian) As soon as he is apprehended and you're notified, bring him in. (In Russian) It'll be a snap. (In Russian) And stick to the plan. (In Russian) Yes! (In Russian) All right, now get to the phones and telegraph. (In Russian) If there is any news get back to me right away! (In Russian) Understood! Back then I have not yet experienced death and couldn't even think that my whole life would be changed forever. I childishly believed that my dad is alive and is in a hospital somewhere with Olha by his side. Kobzar by Taras Shevchenko. To dear Gareth Johns - Peter, can you put this in your backpack, please? It's a present from a friend of ours... in Moscow, to Mr. Gareth Johns... I think the address is in there.. - Oh...

But to walk on the rails is strictly forbidden! Three for me please. Could you please tell me when is the train to Moscow? Maybe tomorrow, at 6 AM. And if you need a place to sleep, there are benches in the station. Thanks! Hot, hot patties with peas! Hot, hot patties with peas! With peas! Hey! (In Russian) You, empty head, gimme the patty! Kazaam! (In Russian) Ball by ball, wanna trade caps? You need to share your patties with us. Give us the patties. Common, come at me! Come at me! Give it back! Give it back! It's mine Get off of me! Wait, don't hit! Kid, where are you? Get up, boy.

Olha, They can't find Peter anywhere. They could arrest us any minute. Olha, we are Volodia, there is no "we". Tthere is only seperate you and I. You never searched for Peter, and now you're just lying to me! Fine, even if we are seperate. Olha, during interrogation, Sytnyk said that he gave Michael the secret documents. They were found neither with Michael's, Nor with his body. But we can still save everything, if we find them. We could be saved. You wretch! You killed an innocent man! He didn't know anything. He only had to pass a book to some reporter in Moscow. If you have any conscience left, rescue the boy for me, rescue Peter. Oh. (In Russian) You sure know how to handle broads. (In Russian) A reporter. (In Russian) In Moscow. (In Russian) The brat was found at the Krasny Kut station. (In Russian) Keep her under surveillance. (In Russian) Yes sir! Here's the water. Are you really blind? Do it this way. Put them on the fire. My father and I also used to make a fire near the river for a picnic. The river was called the Hudson. My mom made salad, and my dad and I cooked hotdogs. Dogs? A dog? No, it's... it's a sausage on a stick - sausage. Here, eat. Thank you. The blind old soldier only looked scary and dangerous. His name was Ivan, but everyone called him Kocherha*. *Kocherha - fire iron in Ukrainian. Maybe because he looked black, like he'd been burned in a fire. Or because he could bend a fire iron with his bare hands. I told Ivan about New York City, The Hudson river, tractors, and my dad. He said he d take me to people who would help me. Your daddy is alive. It's important for you to believe and to hope. Everyone in the world lives on hope. Jesus, my dearest. Joy of my Heart. You're my only sorrow and consolation. You're my delight. The salvation of My Soul... Did you sleep wel? Let's wash our selves. Wash yourself well. Here. More. Yes, like this. Come here. Sit. Let me go! Cover your ears! Your ears, cover! Lice are, of course, a good thing, but... Some kid came up to me, yes. He was asking about tickets to Moscow or Odessa, but I looked at him, and saw he was a little one, no parents. So he walked around for awhile and disappeared. Where could he vanish, though? Probably he went to the bazaar, but as soon as the warrant came, as soon as it came, I immediately immediately reported... I didn't take an extra penny from him. I charged him the same as everyone else. I lose money on this business. Peas didn't harvest well this year. Flour is so expensive. But he was also asking if there are trains to Moscow and Odessa. Yes, he asked! He asked. My patties are good, everybody buys them, and no one complains... Reporting — there was a train to Moscow this morning. No one boarded, but two got off. Regarding the foreigner But we didn't touch him, he bought some patties and shared them with us voluntarily . Actually it was the blind man. He... The blind man? (In Russian) May I? (In Russian) Hello! Yes, Krasny Kut! (In Russian) This is Secret Police! (In Russian) It's for you. Yes. This is Lipetzky. I'm listnening, Comrade Comissioner! Hey everyone! Get out! (In Russian) So did you find the boy? (In Russian) Yes, the boy was here. (In Russian) Did you get him yet? (In Russian) I think well get him by tonight. (In Russian) Wonderful! Something else... (In Russian) A military unit was sent to your district. (In Russian) Which unit? (In Russian) They need a commander. (In Russian) Comrade commissioner, but I... (In Russian) That's an order! (In Russian) His Order. (In Russian) All right, I will meet them... (In Russian) When I have a replacement for you, (In Russian) I'll send him. (In Russian) In a meantime - you're in charge. (In Russian) Yes sir! (In Russian) Do it! The Kobzars gathered in an old Kozak fortress. They sang about freedom, faith, the heroic exploits of the Kozaks. The Fortress was a ruin, but the blind Kobzars didn't see it. They didn't want to see it! We have arrived, little one. We are home. There are no strangers here. This is the Lebiyska language, the secret language of the Kobzars, that only our brothers understand. Lebiy" is a Kobzar who plays the lyre. Remember that. Lebiy. Kydel Klevy! And, to you, may God send you health. Kydel Klevy" is a greeting for good health But, if you see a stranger, mumble as if you're dumb. Kydel Klevy! Good day to you, too, Ivan! Matviy! Is it you brother? Matviy! Hello! Andriy! Andriy. Go to the other boys, warm yourself! Look around, sniff around! Dry your clothes. And this, take this and dry it, go on. Let's go, Matviy? Do you have salt? Shall we pick berries? What's your name? Are you pretending to be dumb? But why? We are all friends here. You are not dumb. What's your name? Andriy. But you are rather strange! You speak our language, but sound like a German. I am not German. I am from America, but don't tell anyone. I am silent as a tomb. Whose guide are you? Ivan Kocherha's. Listen, is it true that he is so angry and strict? No, he only looks angry in truth he is good. And now Kuchuhura has something to tell us. When I played in Pyriatyn, the local teacher brought a man from the capital to me. He recorded my songs and asked questions about the ballads. I heard about him. His name is Yosyp. And then this Yosyp said: Do you know that they want to invite all kobzars, from all over Ukraine, to Kharkiv? They will record our songs and will issue papers to give us freedom to sing anywhere, and protect us from the police. That would be good, because there is no life under the police. can't sing religious and spiritual songs, can't go there, can't sit here... But I think, brothers, that it's a trap. They know our strength, and so want to destroy us. Come on, Ivan who will raise a hand against a blind man? (singing in Ukrainian) We are heading to Kharkiv, and you? We're going to Myrhorod. Have you been to Kharkiv? No. Have you ever been to Myrhorod? No. Not yet. Sofiyka! Farewell! Sofiyka! All set, we can go. (In Russian) Halt! (In Russian) Papers! (In Russian) Kharkiv, UGPU. To comrade Lepitzky. Urgent. (In Russian) During the investigation, the ruins of the old fortress were searched. We met harsh resistance from unknown individuals. (In Russian) Those you search for were not found. (In Russian) Vladimir Sakalovskiy. We'll stay a day or two at Bohdan's home. He'll fix the bandura. Kydel Klevyi, Lebiy! Hello to you, Bohdan! Take a seat, Ivan! You brought one more? Take away the boy! What, you can't find enough food for one more Kozak in your hovel? Ill pay! Oh Ivan, does one need to pay for people's sorrow? Where are you from? I'm from New Y.. from Kharkiv! I see. And where are you heading? To Kharkiv. I see. Shall we go? What, you don't have the soul again? Bohdan... My soul is hurting. I urged the other kobzars to raise the people in revolt. They said we should hide, and make peace. If we rebel all together, the whole nation, at the same time, in the entire Ukraine, then no army could do anything against us. Ivan, we must listen to our elders. I know, I know ... Oh, the Kozak died... But, his glory will not die or rest from now to eternity to the end of time... My friend, why are all of your songs about unhappiness, about suffering? Do you have anything more cheerful? I beg you, I implore you... Can you play something more cheerful, funny dance-like! Perhaps "Hrechanyky" Hrechanyky" Begin! Hrechanyky There's no bread, there's no salo Commies took it all away No cows, no pigs Only Stalin on the wall. Hey my Hrechanyky! Communists are the bosses Peasants are drudges and Cheka agents are fools! Father's in kolhosp, Mother's in kolhosp The children crying in the streets. When they see the GPU (Secret Police) they hide in the bushes... (In Russian) You, son of a bitch! Who's next? Perhaps I am. What's that? This is the "soul". It's place is inside, between the sounding boards. Without a soul bandura doesn't sing. It doesn't have a voice. But why are kobzars blind? It's an old story son. Tsarina Kateryna wanted to destroy Kozaks' homeland, the Zaporizhian Sich. And the big battle began. The Kozak fought a long time. They fought well, the swords did not cut them, the bullets did not kill them. And no one would ever have conquered them, If not for a traitor. But, there was a traitor. 'At night he opened he gates. and led the Tsarina's army into the fortress. They attacked the sleeping kozaks... a traitor But the Tsarina ordered them not to kill the Kozaks but instead to blind them. They were children, you understand, children! It was me who should have died, not them, but me! They were not children, Ivan but soldiers. And they knew well what they were dying for. And death doesn't choose. Whoever was destined — they went. And you need to live! But why Bohdan? In order to live! Didn't you bring a boy here today? Make a man out of this child. It is worth living, if only for this. That's what I think. Tine hooligans wanted to take away his bag, but he didn't surrender it to them. He fought for it. Maybe there is something left in this bag belonging to his father. Go and look. Ivan! There is a book, Kobzar, and an address on it and some papers were hidden behind the binding. I'll read. Do you know about them? No, read! (In Russian) Break the back of all who sabotage grain confiscations. (In Russian) Destroy all resistance and put the Kulaks and the free farmers on the list for extermination. Stalin. and Kaganovich..." Yes. It has begun. It's necessary Bohdan, to organize... No it's not. Someone is probably waiting for these documents. The little boy is no courier, so I'll take him myself. Hide the papers, and put the book back. Close your eyes. Now listen. Listen and smell. What do you hear? The wind is blowing, The trees are whispering... What else? The cow mooing in the pasture. And then what? A bucket is rattling. It smells of cold water Well, we’ll drink it later. And then what? What do you hear? People... are crying somewhere. See, good boy! (In Russian) Hello, mam. (In Russian) Connect me to 013! (In Russian) Yes, waiting. (In Russian) Hello hello. Searched the village. (In Russian) But the American was not found. (In Russian) No, I see. (In Russian) That's where the blind man once brought young orphans there. (In Russian) I see... The Market was full of people - buying selling. No one suspected that soon all their food would be taken from them. It’s important to choose a good spot in the market. Somewhere near the entrance, but not to be trampled on. Where people have already shopped, but still have some money left. And no puddles! And where nothing stinks. Nobody likes it when when it stinks near you. Understand? You can’t speak, remember. It's a bad spot to sit and play here, stinks of fish. Stop, smell it? It also stinks of cheap cologne. Let's get out of here. Yes, yes. Violating the law. Howdy, Ivan! Oh! Hello! Are you singing religious songs again? I have no idea what are you talking about, Hryts'ko Josypovych. I only sing military songs and laments. They're not prohibited, are they? No, these are not. Well! So far! What about this boy you have by your side? This one? It's Andriyko, he's dumb. My cousin's youngest, they have five, so I took one. I thought, you know, it would be easer for him. You know, I have his birth certificate Here! Well, the documents are in order, Look here, Ivan, keep everything in order! But of course! Thank you. Thank you. Good-bye. ♫ For now Truth is trampled underfoot ♫ ♫ And Falsehood is served with fine wines ♫ ♫ For now Truth is cast into dungeons, ♫ ♫ And Falsehood is invited into masters' mansions ♫ ♫ There is no truth in the world... ♫ (In Russian, sounding in background) Join the ranks of the Red Army! (In Russian) Who is with us - three steps forward! Hello, Ivan! Hello, Borys! Give me some tobacco for three karbovantsi. What are newspapers lying about today? They're already killing their own. The latest crime of the enemies of the people. Enemies of the people led by traitor Mykola Sytnyk treacherously killed American Communist Engineer Michael Shamrock. Borys, give me this newspaper, you've already read it anyways. Wrap my tobacco in it. Put it here. (In Russian) The cop at the market supposedly recognized him. (In Russian) However, it's not clear whether it's the kid we're looking for or not. (In Russian) Pretending to be mute. (In Russian) Mute? (In Russian) Of course, mute. (In Russian) The one wearing an overcoat who sings and plays bandura. (In Russian) It seems the boy is his guide, but we're not sure. (In Russian) We searched everywhere, but they vanished into thin air. Once upon a time, here in this swamp, the enemy's army caught up with the Kozaks, and a big battle began. Here? And during this battle one Kozak was separated from the rest, and enemies surrounded him. And the King arrived on the banks of this lake. He looked at the Kozak and said. I will grant you life, brave Kozak, if you put down your weapon and raise your hands. But the Kozak answered, it will happen only when you, Glorious King, come to me and kiss my ass. Are we rowing towards the weeping willows? And the enemies started to shoot at the Kozak with the muskets, pistols, and cannons. When the smoke cleared, the King ordered them to retrieve the Kozak's body. They searched and searched and searched, but never found it. There was no Kozak. He was nowhere to be found. That's right. (In Russian) Demands immediate enforcement. (In Russian) On the Orders of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party. (In Russian) Begging is hereby forbidden and all Musical Instruments must be registered with local Police and Cheka.

(In Russian) Stop! I can't take them. There are check points and Cheka is everywhere. If they see a blind man with a bandura, they will grab us all. Do you think my father survived? Your father is strong. I think he recovered already. What if he is not in Kharkiv? Then he's in Moscow, waiting there for you. The place where you are welcome always spells well. It smells like borshch, milk, flowers. And smells of mother, too. I don’t remember how my mom spelled. Still, you try and remember how it smelled there, at home. New York? Roasted chestnuts and vanilla. You can't find it here. One day I saw this really big fat sheep... Halt, halt! The road has ended. There is supposed to be a bridge here. There's no bridge, it collapsed. Collapsed? Don't be silent, keep talking, go on, what happened then? A hole, a hole! Careful! Don't worry, I'll find the trail now Due to fever and feebleness my eyes kept getting closed and so I couldn't walk any more. All i remember is that Ivan carried me to a house on a hill. And that the river overflowed and flooded all roads around. See if there is anyone in the yard? I can't see anything! You don't look, you sniff, sniff. The place where you are welcome always smells good. May the Son of God be with you and the Holy Ghost protect you . .. Who is this? He got sick a bit. Oh my God, he has a fever. The boy is a wanderer, says nothing about himself. If you let him in the house he will lie near the oven. But if you give him a crust of bread, he will tell you his name is Andriy. Where does it hurt. Talk, don't be mum? Ouch, it hurts there. Andriy you can talk in front of her. Can you tell me, when is the train to Moscow? Where did he wound his leg? Burned it. My fault, I didn't look after him well. No matter. It'll heal. The boy and I will leave soon. Listen, Ivan, would you give up your music? Stay here. I'd love to... But, I can't. Why do you need me, burned as I am? Orysia, big water will subside and we'll need to go. I'll take the boy and will come back then. Orysia! Why are you complaining about God? You know, you are my one and only. Orysia! (In Russian) Volodia! Comrade Vladimir with Baltic welcome! (In Russian) Reporters? (In Russian) No. I am here in business - we are searching for a boy a foreigner, looks 10 or 12 years old. (In Russian) Why would foreigners come here? (In Russian) Comrade Vladimir, listen, what's going on with this tractor? (In Russian) Since it was taken for repairs after filming... (In Russian) We have finished the sowing and harvested without it. (In Russian) But it's an awkward situation. (In Russian) People are are starting rumors... It ain't right. (In Russian) You'll get your tractor, i promise. (In Russian) We really need it! (In Russian) Here are comrades from the city. (In Russian) Hello, comrade! (In Russian) I'm here to collect grain. (In Russian) Here, new orders. (In Russian) We harvested twelve percent more than our quota! (In Russian) Comrade Vladimir, if we had our tractor, can't you see, we would harvest even more. (In Russian) Daugther! Bring my glasses? (In Russian) Comrade Vladimir! (In Russian) Please stay! (In Russian) Are there any kulaks in your village? (In Russian) Kulaks? In our village? (In Russian) The kulaks are long gone. (In Russian) Aha, thank you, dear.. (In Russian) Our village is celebrating. (In Russian) The marriage of my daughter. Listen! We'll dig here. Boys! Breakfast is ready! Potatoes and salo. Tarzan raised his voice in the trouble call of distress... In the higher land, that the tribe frequented, was a little lake... Behind him were two males, and then Kala ... closely straining the little dead... plaintive wailing came from a tiny cradle. Be careful, be careful! And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil... Amen! Why are you praying? If you say "Lord's Prayer" twice, the yolk will be soft, if four times - it will be hard. Ivan likes when "Lord's Prayer" told twice And you? Me? Same as Ivan. Ivan, the water has receded. There's a wedding in Kalynivka, stop by it on your way. Newlyweds asked for it.

What they had done to the blind musicians, I didn't find out myself. But i did know that fear and hunger could turn a man into a beast. Ivan said that when you see a wolf with hungry eyes give him a hunk of bread and he will become a man again. But back then, no one gave me any bread. Listen and smell. Common, who's next?

I promise, I'll come to you later, okay? When will the Kobzars be taken away?
