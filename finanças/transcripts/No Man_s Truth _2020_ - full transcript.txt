It's here. Hayk, promise me you will not let me do anything wrong. I will always be by your side. Today is the day! Sister! Sister! Sister, wake up! Sister, quickly, wake up! Wake up, sister! What's the matter? Let me sleep, will you? What do you mean "let me sleep"? Get up, we need to check your results. Get up! -What results? Your pregnancy test results, crazy. College results, what else? Come on, wake up, wake up. The results will come at two o'clock. Why are you waking me up at 8? But it is possible that the results have come sooner. Come on, man. Wake up, sister, quick, please. Coral, you live in India. Nothing here happens sooner than late. Often, it happens too late, Sometimes it even gets cancelled. But sooner? Never. Never means never! Listen! Hope dies last, OK? Get up, get up! -Man... No, get up! Get up right now! -Coral! Get up, get up! Come on, log in. Quick, quick! Quick, quick! Unless you bring me a cup of tea, I am not going to log in. Are you serious? Not slept properly all night, woke up early in the morning to wake her up, She is more interested in tea than results. As if it's my dream, not hers. What do I care if you study or not? I don't understand anything, What are you saying? Mummy, keep quiet, there is no time now. There is no time for what? On the contrary, Why am I getting so excited? She will go away, I will be left alone. Who will go away? Doesn't matter. What's there in the result? Everything's in the tea. What difference does it make, if you go to college or not? She wants tea. Will you speak louder after all? No! Explain what's going on at least! No! No one has sense of responsibility, She wants tea, doesn't want to know the results. Will you keep muttering under your nose? Will you not say anything? Will you not explain? Yes, I will not. When will this girl change to better? Here, have your tea! What? No! Impossible! What is it, where is it? Tell me, they couldn't have rejected you. Here, See it yourself. The list will be published after... two pm? What happened? Your hope died? Man, you had me do all that work for nothing! No one will wake me up until the list has been published. What a madam! I don't understand, how oil gets into this. Papa, put your legs up. What's the time? It's not two o'clock yet. Where are you going? Take the broom with you at least. I'm going to get a dustpan. Mum! Tell me the time, mum! Mum, what's the time? Will someone tell me the time? Come on, sister, come on, come on! -Coral! You are completely crazy! Come on! It said the results will come after two pm, it didn't say it will come exactly at two pm. Can you stop being so negative? The list has come, and your name is the first on the list. Don't soar so high, if you fall, it will hurt a lot. I will not fall. Really? Here is the list. Stop! Suhana Trivedi! We did it! We did it! Coral! I can't believe it. I am going to study at GSE. My dream has come true. That's it, that's it, sister. No more sleepless nights, No more books all over the room, No more big big formulas, listening to an alien language, No more of it. That's it, that's it! OK, So you are so happy because I will go away, I will empty the room. it will become yours completely, That's why you are so happy, right? Crazy! I'll miss you! A lot, a lot, a lot, a lot! But I am not going to miss you at all. At least, I will get free of you, This time forever! No, sister! What are you doing? Sister! Don't shout, crazy! I'm in class. What do you want? I want you. I want you, come back. Coral, I can't speak now. If the professors sees me talking on the phone, he will throw me out of the class. In that case I will shout even louder so that you're out of not the class, but the college, so that you come back to me. What a sister you are, you went away leaving me here alone. Is college more important than me? I will call you in break. Bye! What's wrong, daddy? Why are you so sad? They called me from Suhana's college. Now, a little while ago. What has happened? She is calling me to college. Who - she? The principal. Coral, is the bag with my saree with you? Has anything happened? The principal of sister's college has called daddy. What for? Has she done anything wrong? Daddy, what did the principal tell you? She said... She said that... I will have to go to Suhana's college. Today. Now. OK, but why? Why are you telling in bits? Explain properly, will you? I don't get anything. Dad, Why do you need to go to college? I need to take Suhana's... I need to... I need to... I need to bring her back. Bring her back? Can't she come on her own? Coral, did you understand anything? Listen, wait for a moment. What is written in these eyes? What is hidden in these stars? Only you are my God today. These evenings are intoxicated, Your talks are mixed with honey, Only you are my God today. Today in my house everywhere in every corner there is a sign of you, And in my room your things are spread everywhere. What is written in these tears? What is hidden in these stars? What else is left to lose? What kind of unease is this? What kind of devotion is this? You are like an inspiration of a poet. Just tell me what your mystery is today. Remove the hair from your face, So that I can see you once properly. And why are your hands trembling today? And this sky is my witness, that I have loved you immensely, Who and what can stop someone from loving? Because even now inside me, inside me somewhere you still live, Only after having left, we remember those who leave. What is written in these tears? What is hidden in these stars? What else is left to lose? What kind of unease is this? What kind of devotion is this? You are like an inspiration of a poet, Just tell me what your mystery is today. Suhana's phone. Yes. Do you know its passcode? Yes. Open it. Go to Videos. Just watch. What is this? This can't be true, no! The principal of the college showed me this video in her phone. Everyone in the college has this video in their phones, Coral. 2-3 minutes after it was spread, Suhana jumped off the balcony. Suhana couldn't have done anything like this. Who made this video? Who spread it? The number that it was sent from doesn't exist anymore. The sim was destroyed. I found out from the company. But whose name was the sim on? They refused to inform me. They say, they will tell that only to the police. Let's go to the police in that case. What do you think, I didn't go to the police? And? What and? They said, how does it matter whose name the sim was on? The girl, obviously, danced on her own will, In front of her boyfriend, Then probably they had an argument, And to take a revenge the boyfriend made the video viral. The girl took it close to her heart, and committed suicide. Dad, I spoke with my sister every day. Ten times a day. Or even more than that. I knew about her each step. She couldn't have done that, dad. If you knew about her each step, How come... How come she didn't tell you about this video? How will we find out what happened at that time? Papa, I need admission in that college. What? Yes. I will study in GSE from the next semester, You speak to the principal, Say whatever you want, Say that we will go to the police, that we will make a scandal in the city. Say that a professor forced her to give her better marks. That is why she did it. Dad, say anything, but I need to be admitted into that college. What are you saying? I can't do such a dirty thing. Spoil someone's reputation? No. How do you know that it's not the truth? I don't know if that is the truth. If I knew that was the case, that professor wouldn't be alive today. But because I don't know that, I cannot do such a base thing, spoil someone's good name. Not even for my sister? If later we come to know that the police were right? How will I look into that principal's face? Let the principal go to hell, let the police go to hell, let everyone else go to hell! What about our reputation? Yes, it as well. If you think that way, who knows, maybe your sister also thought that way when dancing that dance? We don't know, dad. And to find out that, I must go to that college. To find out what had happened. Otherwise we will live the rest of our lives asking ourselves what is the truth? OK. I will speak to the principal. One more thing. Don't tell your mother about this until you are admitted to the college. Or else, she won't allow another of her children go there where she lost the other one. She will be afraid. And you? Aren't you afraid? I am also afraid, Yes, I am. But I do not allow the fear to control me. Because if I let the fear take over me, for the rest of my life I will become the slave of the fear. Please, come in, Mr Trivedi. Please, take your seat. Is there anything I could do to help you overcome this difficult situation? I don't think it will be possible for me to overcome the sorrow of the death of my child, Anuji. Of course, not. That's not what I meant. Mr Trivedi, please, please, calm down. Please. Mam. Yes? It was Suhana's childhood dream to study in this college. Day and night she worked very hard to make sure that she gets the admission. And... Just after a month only... Mr Trivedi, please, control yourself. Please, calm down. Mam, Suhana's younger sister, Coral. She wants to fulfil her sister's dream. She wants to study here as a substitute for her sister. Of course, If you help us in getting her transferred into your college... Look, I completely understand your and your daughter's pain. As a parent, I share your sorrow, your pain. But, as the principal of this college, I cannot break the rules. There is a legal procedure for it. Try to understand me. Please, put yourself in my place. But Suhana put so much effort to get admitted here. Day and night she worked hard. If we don't fulfil her dreams somehow, how will her soul rest in peace? If getting admitted here was indeed so important to her, Then, Why didn't she put all her mind in her studies? Why did she waste her time in such a shameful act, for which she had to commit suicide to save her and your reputation? That's why my daughter wants to come here: to restore our reputation You showed me a video, It turns out, there is a complete version of it, in Suhana's phone. And it is shown there that a professor from your college forces her to dance like that so that he gives her a pass mark in the exam. so that she can clear the exam. Who is that professor? We will find that out. There is one more thing that you need to know. In that video at one point Suhana tells him that she will tell you everything. and the professor replies, "She very well knows about whatever is going on in the college." It's utter lie, Mr Trivedi. You will tell that to the police If we give this video to the police. Are you threatening me, Mr Trivedi? See, Mam, Times are such Nowadays, people are motivated not by compassion, but by fear. Sorry, sorry, late for the class. The Constitution of India was adopted on... Is this the Constitution class? Yes, but you are very late. Sir, she is late because of me. Actually, when I was rushing to class, I knocked her off and she fell. And I left her like that. She must have hurt herself. Take a seat, and make sure, this doesn't happen again. So, as I was saying before I was interrupted, The Constitution of India was adopted on 26th of November, 1949 by Constituent Assembly. And it came in effect on... You're sitting with your hoody still on? How does my hoody bother you? You're in class, in front of the professor. I am in class to study, and I assure you, my hoody doesn't disrupt my studies at all. It bothers me. Wow! Don't the earrings of that girl bother you? And the shirt of this guy? Only my hoody bothers you? And who knows, if I put my hoody down and you don't like my hair, will I have to have my hair cut as well? The thing is, sir, my hoody bothers you, so it's your problem and you have to deal with it yourself. So don't waste your time now, and do your work, which is that of a teacher, not a fashion advisor. How do you dare to speak to me like that? Like what? Disrespectfully. I only met you 5 minutes ago, So far you haven't given me any reason to respect you. Get out of my class. Sir, it seems like you are forgetting that this is a college, not your home for you to throw me out whenever you want. If you don't leave the classroom immediately, I'll leave. Every person makes their own choice, My choice is to sit here, and learn something. which obviously hasn't been happening since I've come. What you want to do, sir, it's your choice. Judging by how sir left, I don't think he will come back. Come on, let's go and calm him down. Let's go convince sir. Come on, let's go everyone. Are you mad? How dare you talk to the professor like that? Because of you, we all missed our lecture. Did you hear what i just said? Every person makes their own choice, and my next choice can hurt you a lot. Now you decide, if you still want to speak or to keep quiet. She is insane. I don't want to stay in this class. I admire your courage, but you're wrong. About what? About everything you said. Listen, I don't care what you think, I haven't come here to explain anything to you, or discuss anything with you. or to prove anything right or wrong. I don't care what you think or what you don't... I'm talking to you. Put your phone aside, I'm talking to you. Why? How does my phone bother you? You want to speak, speak. I am supposed to listen, I'm listening. Whether I look at you and listen or turn my back to you, or dance and listen. What do you care? Your work is to explain, so do that. Don't waste either your or my time. Logic can be applied everywhere, but humans are driven by feelings, not by logic. Coral? Hey, hero! Come on! The principal is calling you. Beautiful name, Coral. My name is Hayk. And a beautiful finger as well. Listen, I understand what you're going through at this moment. Probably you blame this institute and everyone in it for what happened to your sister. Yes, I do. It is easier to blame others Try once to take the blame on yourself, you might come to know what had happened. My sister is just a year older than me. Was. We grew up in the same room since childhood I knew everything about her. Her first date, first kiss, everything. Then how come you didn't know about that video? That's what I've come to find out here. Do you mind taking your hoody off? So what? Will you find it out by arguing with professors? Don't you think if you make friends, you will get more information? I am not here to make friends. I'll find the truth by my own means. There is this girl in the class. She came for the first time today, and she's been so arrogant to everyone. She spoke so disrespectfully to sir, that he threw the marker and left the classroom. Sir told her to leave the classroom, she said, "No, I won't go, if you wish to go, then go, it's your choice." After that, without any reason, she was being rude and arrogant to everyone. There is that girl. Sunny. Oy, hello! Wait! Come! Sir is calling you. Who? Roy Sir! Why is he calling me, your sir(sar(Hindi)-head)? He wants to speak to you. He wants? Not "he", HE (respectful). He wants to speak to you, come on! he (informal) wants to speak to me, so he will have to come to me. Go, tell him (informal). If you don't come right now, you'll regret it a lot later. Sir! What? You don't know what happened yesterday. Don't even want to know, get out of the way. Sir, I met a friend yesterday who used to study here, and as soon as I mentioned your name, she praised you a lot. Really? Yes! Which friend? Sir, you probably don't know her, but she felt so proud that she knows you, she told me that you're her Idol. So what should I do? Sir, please take a selfie with me. I'll show it to her, she'll be very jealous. Here you go. Come on, come here. Thank you, sir! Hi! Is this your bag? The guard brought it in the morning, before the lessons, So? You're going to stay with me instead of Suhana? Much better. Why? Just like that. I didn't like her. She was very arrogant. She thought she was better than others. Bu then everyone got to see her real face. What happened? A video with her came, in which she was dancing naked. Naked? Yeah, almost. This video was sent to everyone in the college, And on the very day the video came that very day she jumped. "She jumped" meaning? You don't know? She committed suicide, she jumped from the balcony on the 3rd floor of the college. What the hell are you doing? In the future, think better before speaking about someone's death. Tomorrow your family might be in the same situation. Today after classes, come directly to the auditorium. You have to pay respect to Roy sir. In this college,everyone is hungry for respect. I don't have it. Sorry. Tell Roy sir to ask the Constitution professor, how Coral pays respect. Roy sir might not like her way, you know. We are very well aware what she did, how and with who. We know it all. But I'll give an advice for your own good. Don't do any such tricks with Roy sir. Or else? What? Or else what? Before you came, another brave girl was here, in whose bed you're sleeping now. Don't you know her "The End"? She, too, just like you, always flew high in the sky, and then one day... she fell. End of the story. If you learn something from that story, it might serve you well. At least she flew. You've been crawling under people's feet your whole life. And if you happen to come under my feet, that will be your last stop. Wow, Sunny, you have to admit it, her dialogues are really good, aren't they? Although, I've heard this one before. Listen, the professor is about to come. I won't come. She's joking. Stop following me. Who was Suhana to you? Why are you asking this? Older sister? Sit down everyone. How did you get to know she was my sister? Suhana Trivedi, Coral Trivedi. Today we're going to learn about the role of That could be a coincidence. -ph table in everyday life. Yeah, it could be, but the pen proved it. Please, hand out some? Take one, pass one back. If you tell anyone, I'll break your mouth. Look, if you threaten me like this, I'll go to that bloody Roy in the first break to complain about you. So, write down on top "ph chart". And why will you not do it? Because now you will tell me, Hayk, I'd be really grateful if you keep it a secret for now. I know, you just said it in your mind. That's enough for me, no worries. Can anyone give me any examples of everyday life products that are highly acidic. -Coral? You'll have to go to Roy. Who will force me to go? You? No, you will go by yourself. I won't go. What about neutral acidity? Water. Water. Can you think of a better way than following Suhana's steps to know what happened to her? Do you know anything about it? Blood Blood. Good! I don't know exactly, but if you ask girls, they will tell you. No, actually they won't tell you. Why? Right, what are we left with? We're left with... Because when one person goes against everyone, even if they are right, everyone will go against them. And you've been doing that since you've come. Can anyone think of anything? Coral, everyone's not an enemy, and without friends, you won't win the war alone. Does anyone know... I will win. -anything about... And if anyone refuses to speak, I'll break their mouth, they'll speak easily. First, no one can speak with a broken mouth and second, they'll speak today, but the next morning together they'll break your mouth. Bloody coward. There's a huge difference between a coward and a smart person, I don't know why people can't see it. Poor justifications for poor hearts. Does anyone know anything about... They asked her to dance, but she refused. Anything else? No, nothing else. Ok. Ok. I'll give you a hint. That's something we use when we bake cakes. She refused. That's all you found out? Ok, write it down. Copy the chart down, please, all of it. Hey, you! Do you think I am blind or deaf? Do you think I cannot see you moving down there, here, all the time speaking. What is this? Get out of my class. Don't go. Come on, quick. Where are you going? I'm going out. I haven't given you permission to go out. I haven't given you the right to give me permission, Mam. Free citizen of a free country. I'll sit if I want to, I'll go if I want to. Mam, don't mind her words, The thing is... Stop this nonsense and come. Mam, on her behalf... Right, everyone just, copy down the chart. Roy, is she coming or not? It's been more than 10 minutes now. I need to go after all. Come on, Aashna, wait. She'll definitely come. Because if she doesn't show up this time, she will regret it a lot. All this is a nonsense. What do you mean? I think all this is very wrong, after what happened to Suhana. But what has Suhana's death got to do with this? I don't know. And look, it doesn't matter. What matters is that because of that bastard, those parents lost their daughter. I also have a sister, Roy, and when I imagine her in... Come on, Lena. I also feel sorry for her parents, I feel bad, man. But... What to do? if their daughter was like that, shameless. What I don't understand is, what was the big deal about that video because of which she committed suicide? Why are you all staring at me? What did I say wrong? Yes, she danced taking her clothes off. Nowadays, people upload such videos on YouTube, they get millions of views, they earn heaps of money. Look at Sunny Leone, became superstar from a pornstar. Actually, she is right. I mean, Whatever happened, happened. You can change your college, change your city, OK, max to max, change the country as well, but dude, suicide? it's a little too extreme. Well, for some, honour matters more than their life. But what is this honour? Others' opinion about you. They say by dying you save your honour, but when you're dead, how does it matter if you have honour or not? I suggest, you comfortably live as long as you can. Today people think like that, tomorrow they will think something else. The same Sunny Leone, even today, some people call her a pornstar, some call her superstar. Now, it is Sunny's choice who she wants to listen to, isn't it? Wow, my son! Nowadays you've also started giving big speeches? Thanks to your friendship, sir. Friendship? How would you know what honour is? What pride is? If that girl comes, take some lessons of self-respect from her, you might not learn to fly but at least you'll learn to walk standing upright. Don't say that, Mam, we respect Roy sir. What is bad about it? I'm leaving. Stay, please, Lena. Anyway, she won't come. And even if she does, I don't want anything from her. The respect I've earned myself, is enough for me. Lena, it is not about respect, it is about traditions. Always, in all colleges, juniors pay respect to seniors, you've also done it, we've also done it, now she also has to do it. This is the tradition, and it should go on. Now you also go on. Britishers ruled over India for 300 years, and in those 300 years, every year, millions of people of India used to say the same thing that you're saying now. Last year also they were ruling, let them do it this year as well, until one man came and said that it was wrong. What has this got to do with all this, Lena? You've come very late. You guys have 10 minutes, so hurry up. How can you speak like that to sir? Come on, stand up. Sunny! Just chill, bro. Nice model, of the phone. It's lightweight as well. Let's see how it flies. Catch it! Ashu, catch! Shit! Oops! I'm really bad with ball games. By the way, I am sorry on behalf of the boys. Poor lads get nervous when they see a beautiful girl. Anyway, nothing happened to your phone. Here! Take your phone. First say, "Sorry, Sir" and "Thank you, Mam". Then take your phone. Ashna, give her the phone! I will give, but first, let her say it. Okay. Roy! Look,the Wonderwoman has come to our college. Listen, Let her go and only say, "Sorry, Sir, sorry, Mam" then you can go, no one will do anything to you. Otherwise, look around, We're four, you're alone. I'll kill you, bloody... Ashna, Ashna, Go sit there, let me handle this. Where are you going, baby doll? You forgot to apologise. You only need to say "Sorry, Mam, sorry, Sir" Then you go your way, We go our way. Come on, don't be stupid. Say the words, and then you can peacefully go. Look, my child, One way or another, you will go from here. The question is will you go forward or upward. You are right, One way or another, I will go from here. But the question is, how many of your bones I will break before I go. You're speaking too much, come on, apologise! Relax, relax. And this is our auditorium. Roy sir, Jay sir, you're also here! I am live on Instagram showing our college. One moment, sir. Friends, these are our beloved senior students, Roy sir and Jay sir. Sir, will you say "Hi" to my friends, please? Hi, guys! Welcome to the college and... I hope you'll like the college and will consider it to study in the future years. Hello, everybody. Warm, warm welcome to our college. We are hoping that you will join the juniors here, We love our juniors over here, In fact, before our... Hey, what's his name? Before our beloved Hayk came here, we were giving very warm welcome to this junior. Coral! You're also here! I was looking for a girl to show us the girls' hostel. Good that I met you. Come on, show us, what the girls' hostel looks like. This idiot is making fool of us, sir. He knew very well that we'd be here after the classes. He was there when I told Coral to come here. He thinks he is very smart, bloody... Let it be, Roy, I'll get rid of all his smartness tonight. Were you eavesdropping from behind the door all the time? Of course, you don't think I accidentally entered at the very right moment? It only happens in films, In real life you have to take precautions. And what was that nonsense about Instagram? Nonsense? You have courage, brain goes to sleep? Instagram live, the best pocket weapon of modern times. It's even better than pepper spray. Even if one person joins live mode, the criminal will step back. I didn't need your help. You're welcome. Sanjay, please, see who is there. Sir, you? So, Hayk? You've been having a lot of fun nowadays. That too by fooling us. Isn't it wrong? What do you say Sunny? Making a fool out of seniors, is it wrong or not? It is very wrong, Sir. And for doing wrong things, one has to be punished. So, tell me, Hayk. What punishment should you get? You're going to decide that, sir. Man, nothing comes to my mind. You tell, Sunny. What shall we do? Sir, I think, he should wash your feet and drink that water. By doing this, he will understand your value. Good idea. Going up and down the stairs all day long my feet have got really tired. What an idea, Sunny! Nilesh! Go get some water. Nilesh! Thank you! Sir, I have another fantastic idea. Tell. Sir, He is very fond of Instagram, isn't he? Why don't we make a video of him and upload it on Instagram? So guys, this is our boys' hostel... Yes, dad. No, nothing yet. Once I get to know anything, I'll call you immediately. How could he? Yes. Dad, I'll call you back in some time. So, guys, this is our boys' hostel room and this is our Hayk. Today our friend Hayk decided to give a present to our senior Jay Sir. Jay Sir. Jay Sir, do you know what present Hayk is going to give you? No, I don't have a clue, but it has something to do with water, because, look, there is so much water over here. Do fast whatever you want to do, the video cannot exceed 1 minute. Sorry, Sir, I'm late. Ok. Take your seat! Thank you. Hey, Hayk, tonight come to my room as well, my feet are also aching, I'll add strawberry flavour in the water for you. Be quiet! No, man. -Silence! I had enough yesterday. Laugh! What is going on? Laugh! That idiot's joke seemed very funny to you, Isn't this funny enough? Laugh! I said go take your seat. Can anyone explain what is going on in this class? Follow me to the principal. Come. May I come in? Yes please. Come on, come in. Anu Mam, these two disturb the whole class intentionally. His stupid jokes and her violence disturbs the whole class. She is a very dangerous girl. Look, how disrespectful she is. Who should I respect? You? Why? You're about 50 years old and in front of a woman, you're complaining like a child to his mother. Keep quiet. How dare you speak to me like that? Professor, they will get the punishment that they deserve. You, please, go back to class, don't waste the lesson. Hayk, you must be very upset about what had happened yesterday. You know about it? What? You've seen the video. You know about it, and instead of that bloody Jay, we are standing here in your office. One doesn't have to do anything with the other. It does. No. Let it go, Coral. Don't touch me. Let it go, let it go, let it go. Because of this "let it go", such things happen in this college and no one gives any punishment to them. Keep your voice down. This is what you teach your students, keep your voice down, keep quiet, anyone does anything to anyone, just keep quiet. You say one more word, I will throw you out of this college. Don't forget I've done a favour to your father by admitting you in this institution. You're doing favour not to me, but to the criminals like Jay, every day, every moment, by keeping quiet. Whatever happened yesterday, was Hayk's own decision. Of course, what else could he do? Should he have come to you for help? And what would you tell him? Keep quiet? Keep your voice low? Don't cross the limit, Coral. That's right, in the world of the strong, the weak are always the culprits. Keep quiet. Shut up! She'll be very sorry for what she had spoken. I am not going to tolerate such disrespect. Mam please, Mam… Mam… Please listen to me. Go from here, I don't want to listen. Mam just 2 minutes, please, Mam. Say what you have to say. Mam, her ways are wrong, but she has a good heart. The way she speaks is wrong, but what she is saying has a little truth in it, right, Mam? Are you telling me that I have to be blamed for what happened yesterday? No, Mam, I think, we're all responsible for whatever happens in our society. It is never a single person's fault. Go explain this to your friend. I'll explain, Mam. She has already suffered a big loss and she is very angry from within with the whole world. Give me some time so that I explain to her that her anger won't help her in anything. OK. But let her know that she should not come to my office again. Yes, Mam. Go away. Bloody coward. Go, go wash the feet of seniors, drink that water, go wash their underwear and drink that water too. Go away, I said. Today I feel very, very proud of my sister. Rather than living like you, it's better that she died. Bloody worm. This is my elder brother's photo, Veer, 5 years ago. And this is my brother's photo, 2 years ago. What had happened? My brother was just like you, "Veer", brave (Hindi), just like his name. Although sometimes I thought that he was just a fool. Everyone was afraid of him in the college. Be it senior or junior, if anyone made a mistake, he would beat them up. Fighting was in his blood since childhood. He was in 3rd year, some senior student had been bothering a 1st year girl since several weeks. The girl told my brother, and my brother beat him up. Some two days later, my brother was coming from a club with his friend. That guy and some other 10 guys caught my brother. The friend ran away, but running away was against my brother's principles. So he didn't run, he stayed and fought. He fought with all his strength. but he wasn't strong enough to fight with 10 guys, Coral. That only happens in Salman Khan's movies, where one hero fights 20 villains, and still, the hero wins. And that is what inspires our youth. as if, that is the power, as if, you can win only by fighting. Our movies don't have heroes like Mahatama Gandhi. And my brother was a Salman Khan fan. Your brother did the right thing, his friend, bloody coward, he ran away. Instead of your brother, his friend should have ended up in the wheelchair. But it's not him, my brother is the one in the wheelchair, and for his whole life, Coral. And, who knows, if that friend hadn't run away, both of them would be in the wheelchair now. Would it be better? I would rather die than live like this. This was 2 years ago. At that time he used to say that he wanted to die, but today he doesn't. Today he is preparing for the Paralympics. Do you understand, Coral? They didn't just beat my brother, they spat on him and two of them peed on him. Yes, I am afraid. I'm afraid that I won't be able to fulfil my parents' incomplete dreams. Yes, I drank that water yesterday, I either had to drink that water, or get a beating from those three. I thought, despite what my brother had been through, he contnues to live, so I definitely can live despite drinking that water. It's easier for me than for my parents to see both of their children in the wheelchair. I... I wish I could... I wish I could have told this to my sister before she... Don't give so much importance to any one event in your life, that it should change all your aims and dreams. I'm not going to stay in this college for long, just three years, after that I'll leave. I'll have a degree, work, I'll have a family, and I will keep them happy, but my brother won't be able to do any of this. The girl for whom my brother fought with those guys continues living her live. The ones who beat him up also continue with their lives. Only... my brother's life has changed. Was it worth it? It was, Hayk. Because if people start thinking like you, people like Jay will get more courage, And then there will be no limits of tolerating, But is it necessary to solve every matter by fighting? We had both Bhagat Singh and Mahatama Gandhi in this country. Who won? Hi, listen, I just want to say that what Jay did to you yesterday was very wrong. He's crossed all the limits and I'll talk to him about it. Also, tell him that I am looking for him. Wherever I see him, I'll bury him right there. You didn't understand a thing. Yesterday night you were Gandhi, right? But you lost, Hayk. If you become Bhagat Singh tonight, tomorrow morning you might be hanged. and there is no victory after death. Because today I'm alive, I can win tomorrow. You're right. Victory is a prize only for the "living", but for the living to enjoy that prize, many have to die, Hayk. Hello. Hi, Coral. Listen, I'm here in front of the hostel and I just remembered that I forgot my wallet in the room. It's in the drawer next to my bed. Could I ask you to bring it down? Please? Okay. I'll be there in a minute. Thank you, thanks a lot. The auto has stopped some 10 meters away from the hostel gate, just turn left from the gate and walk straight. I'll see you there. Hi! Roy, what did she say? What will she do to me wherever she sees me? She'd bury you. Well, here I am. Come on, bury. Why have you brought me here? We have some... pending work with you. If you remember? I don't remember. Then we'll remind you. You owe an apology to Roy Sir and Jay Sir. Sunny... We don't have much time, so you know, make it quick. Come on, hurry up. Sorry, Roy Sir. Sorry, Jay Sir. Ok, good, from now on remember how you must address them. Done? Shall we go back now? Come on boys, let's go. Hey, wait, wait, wait... Roy, Sunny, we've made so much effort, we've taken so much trouble, we should get some payback, after all. What do you want to do? Come on, Dance. And the sexier you dance, the sooner you'll go home. This wasn't part of the plan, Jay. But now it is. This isn't the first time, is it? Come on! What are you waiting for? Stop the music! Not happening, baby doll. I won't dance. You won't dance? We'll make you dance. Roy! You won't do anything to me. Aren't you scared? You're alone and we're three. Even if there were 15 of you. I don't think that you three are so stupid that I should be scared of you. What do you mean? I mean, you guys should understand that if you do anything to me, One by one, I will tell your names to the police. Only if you get out alive from here. I will get out alive, Sunny. Because, for a stupid principle, no one will be ready to become a murderer. If anyone apart from us gets to know about this, you three will be hanged, won't you? And Naina? She knows you brought me here, doesn't she? Do you have complete trust even in her? Are you ready to become murderers for one dance? Take me back right away, and I will do a favour to you all. I won't go to the police. Ok? She...she is bluffing. Just like that. Nonsense. About what? If we do something to her, she can take us to the police? That if we kill her, we can be hanged? Let's go! Everyone. Anyway, we got our apology. I'm going to kill this idiot. Coral? Did you see what just happened? What happened? Didn't you see? Those guys kidnapped me. I came down to give your purse. I saw you standing next to the auto. Then all of a sudden someone covered my face, put me in the trunk and drove away. Didn't you see? No, I didn't see. I was waiting for you for quite a while. Really? But I remember seeing you waving to me. Yes, yes, I remembered, I waved to you, but you know what? I waved to you and then I said something to the driver, and when I looked back, you weren't there. I mean, it wasn't you. So I thought maybe I was waving to someone else. I don't know. I think they kidnapped me by mistake. Why? It was very strange. First, they put me in the trunk, then for long a time the car kept going and going… and then they dropped me off here, in front of the hostel. And then all of a sudden the trunk opened, as soon as I came out, the car speeded away. I couldn't even note the plate number. Strange, right? Yeah. Wow, girl, how lucky you are that nothing happened to you. So... will you go to the police? No. Why will I go to the police? Nothing happened to me. Why would I unnecessarily go to the police? But I got so scared. I mean, all the energy drained out of my body. Really, let's sleep. I'm sleepy. Good night. Light. Coral? What happened to my purse? Oh man, I did bring your purse down, but... I don't know, where it got misplaced during the kidnapping. I don't remember at all, Naina, I'm really sorry. It's ok. Doesn't matter. The good thing is that you're fine. It's ok, forget it. Good night. Good night. Shut up or else... I'll burn you up. Please, no. Please, no. You have photos of my sister with a guy in your phone, Who is he? Which… which photos? In your phone, there are photos of Suhana with a guy in the bed. Su… Suha... Suhana was your sister? Tell me about the photos, who is that guy? I don't know. You don't know? I really don't know. One day... One day, I came back from the club and as soon as I opened the door, I saw Suhana with that guy in the bed. I just took the pictures and left. I don't know. Where did you sleep that night? In Anita and Sunaina's room. Did you blackmail Suhana with those photos? Not me. "Not me" meaning? Yes, yes, yes... I did...I did... What did you want from her? Nothing, nothing much... just... just to complete my assignments and pay for my lunch. Who else have you shown these photos? We did not show it to anyone. We? Me and Suhana. And that dance video? I didn't do that. I swear, I swear. Unlock this. Do it. Take off your clothes. What? Take off your clothes. Take off your clothes, Naina, Take them off. Quickly! Remove all your clothes, Naina. Come on, stand up, remove your pant. Quickly. Don't worry, I am not base like you. I won't show to anyone. This is just to keep a secret whatever happened tonight. Did you fill in the exam form? The deadline is tomorrow. What are you saying? He said it was the day after tomorrow. No, it is tomorrow and if late, you'll have to pay a penalty fee of Rs.100 Tonight, until what time is the cyber open? Till 7 or 8. I filled the form, Rs.600 for the fees. And the penalty is…? -Listen, Come, I need to talk to you. How much is the penalty? Rs.100. We'll talk later. You burnt her hair? Not burnt. Just to scare her a little. And if she goes to the police? She won't go, I've taken precautions. Really? What will she do then? Nothing, Hayk. What will she do? Coral, a scared person never sits quietly. You don't think she'll simply forget what you have done and move on? I don't know. I'm confused. Whatever she says make sense and doesn't make sense at the same time. You know what bothers me? What? That everything happened very fast. I mean, In the very first month she came, she made a boyfriend, slept with him in her hostel and danced for him. Hayk, you know what's killing me? I'm completely confident that my sister never hid anything from me. But knowing all these facts, what if she actually had a boyfriend? What if she never told me anything about it? What if she danced on her own will? To find the answers to all these "what ifs", I think there is only one way: To find that guy in the photos. Yes, but how? Should I call all the guys on my sister's contacts list and ask them, "Are you that guy"? Obviously, they are going to deny. So, where was I? You didn't tell me what I should do, for joining theatre and my family tell me... One minute, how did that boy enter the girls' hostel? Either he jumped over the wall or he bribed someone? Yeah. You're right. Now, after Suhana's death, it's unlikely that the watchman will admit that someone had bribed him. We can't force him. We certainly can. I'll do it right away. Right now, immediately... Coral, wait! Don't do anything stupid. Why? Do you have any better option? I don't have it right now, but let me think. I'm so interested in acting, so let's do acting. but, now, I want to do fashion and... Coral, you can't simply go around scaring and hurting people. At one point you will get yourself into big trouble. Bigger trouble than my sister's death? I don't think so, Hayk. Coral, please, wait. I know what you feel, okay. But stop and look at yourself, is that who Suhana would want you to become? Is that what I wanted my sister to become? She is just a memory now, a handful of... ashes scattered somewhere in the sea. Coral, wait! Let us sit and talk. I don't want to talk Hayk, let me go. Coral, I can't let you go like this. What will you do? Beat him up? Hayk, let go off my hands. Coral, listen... I said, leave... You touch her once again and you'll have to learn to write with your feet to pass the exams, idiot. Don't do anything stupid, Coral. What a hero? Bastard. Listen, Coral, I'm really sorry for what I did yesterday. I swear, I am. I'm also very sorry for the other day in classroom. You might not believe it, but your courage opened up new dimensions for me. You're so small and fragile, still, you are so brave, Much braver than I am. Many professors, students hate you because you defy their authority, But I can assure you one thing, you know, secretly, they all respect you. I respect you. No, that is enough. Say anything, openly. No, no. Although...to do this Ok, do one thing, Say hi to your wife on my behalf. Let's go, I will tell you everything. He doesn't know anything. How is that possible? Let's sit, I will tell you. He admitted that sometimes some people bribe him to take a friend inside. He even admitted that sometimes he falls asleep on duty, But he says that it also happens that they jump over the back fence to get in. Tell me about that night, Hayk. That night he was on night shift duty and no one went in while he was there. While he was there? Isn't it possible that he is lying? No, I don't think so. If he meant to lie, why would he tell the other details? Right. So what shall we do? Hayk. Yes? Why did you meet with the watchman before me? Because I knew, If you had gone, you would quarrel with him. Sunaina. Sunaina. Have you seen Naina? She left. When will she be back? She won't, her parents called her home, so she went away. Ok. Sunaina, when did Naina last sleep in your room? She never did. Are you sure? Yes. Bloody, she ran away. She also left. The last link to that guy in the photos. In any case, I am not going to give up. But what shall we do? Coral? I know this is going to be sensitive, but do you... mind showing those photos? Maybe I will notice something that you might have missed. Don't you think their position is somehow unnatural? You are right. Since the first time I saw it, I've been thinking that something is weird. Who sleeps like that, the head under the pillow? Not necessarily, my father often sleeps like that. There are some people who sleep with their heads under the pillow or under the cover. Yes, but it is also possible that he did is specifically... for the photo, to hide his face. Yes, why not? Wait a moment. What is this dark point? Where? Here, look. On the back. Looks like a birthmark. Doesn't it? It looks like it but it's very dark and it's not natural. Come on, now you're becoming paranoiac, nothing seems natural. This can be a good tool to find that guy. But it is also possible that it was specifically made to mislead people. No. I don't think so. Hide it quickly, take it. Why are you going? We will speak later. Hi I hope, I didn't disturb. You definitely did. Sorry. No you're not sorry. What do you want? I am doing what I want. That is? Sit next to you and talk to you. To talk to someone, mutual desire is necessary, which is not the case here. What shall we do to bring that desire? Go apologise to all those people, who you have ragged, have beaten up senselessly, molested, humiliated and then come and talk to me. That's impossible. Well, you've got the answer to your question. Not because I don't want to, because everyone... everyone whom I've bothered, is not here right now. The one who should be here is not here, which is why I am here. But without that person, I am not myself. Hey Hayk, listen. Today I am in a mood to laugh. You are already standing, tell us a joke, it will become a stand-up comedy. He himself is a joke. OK, come on, do one thing, tell me your ambition in life, we'll laugh on that. Yes, yes. I just want to become a big man. Want to become big... Look, to become a big man, you need the blessings of your elders. That's right. Come on, take my blessing. Come on... Take it. Hey, wait, wait, wait... I eat food with this hand. Take this hand. What about the blessings of the Goddess? Goddess! Come on, man. Hey, it will be good for you. Kiss my hand. Oh, I'm sorry, I changed my mind, kiss my feet. Why are you doing this? Me? I am doing this? You're doing it, Hayk. Look around you, you're breaking the courage of how many by putting up with their bullying? Why don't you understand, Hayk? That you're encouraging them by tolerating them. More than them, I hate you, Hayk. Yeah, ok! Done? You've given enough lectures. Get lost from here. I think she is from Lena's class, everytime lectures, blah, blah, blah, blah... Come on, get lost. Sir, just give me a chance, I swear I'll make her lick the dust under your feet, only then her bloody arrogance will be gone. Shall I give him a chance? See this? Now see this as well. Hey... Enough, You get it? Enough Jay, enough. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, man? How far? How far will you take all this? What next? Will you make him clean your ass? Yes? Will that be enough? Will you make him suck your dick? Then will you feel powerful? then you'll make a video and spread it in the whole college? Until when? Until he kills himself to get free from you? Will you feel powerful enough then, Jay? Is that what you want? What's wrong with you, Sir? Don't call me Sir, Got it? Your brother is much older than you, do you call him Sir at home? I don't want your Sir, got it? Apologise to him. Come on, let it be. Jay, apologise to him, right here, right now, or else... I don't want it. If it's not coming from his heart, what is it worth? So what do you want, man? Why do you tolerate so much? You don't fight back, you don't run away, you don't answer back. Why? You said it yourself. How far? I let him explore the depth of the darkness of his own heart. I want to show him the limits of this darkness. Brother, believe me, there are no limits to the depths of the darkness of dirty hearts of people like us. I've been there. There is no limit, not for base people like us. Not for people like you, but for everyone. Look at Coral, she is so strong and confident, but to fight the wrong, she hurts others again and again. How dare you compare me with these idiots? How should I not compare? We're all the same, whenever power comes into our hands, we misuse it, whatever the reason. Ok, tell me one thing, you're so strong and confident, since you have come to college, how many times have you helped people? Just want to punish? Power means punish? He thinks he is very smart, I'll drag him back by his hair, then he will understand what power is. Such an idiot you are. What did I do wrong, Sir? Hi I just need to speak to someone. I couldn't think of anyone better. May I come in? Did you bribe someone or jumped over the wall? Jumped over the wall. And how did you enter the building? A friend opened the door for me. Naina left, I've heard? Not "left", ran away. She won't be able to run far from her conscience. At school, I used to love History lessons. Then why are you doing engineering? Parents? You know what seemed to me very interesting in history? All the big empires, from the Romans to the Britishers, the bigger they became, the weaker they became. As if their weakness lied in their power. Indeed. Coral? I am so weak, Coral. Do you know what I mean? It's strange, but I like this weakness. I am afraid of power. Hayk was right saying that power means punish. That is the truth. Truth. Is there such a truth, which everywhere, for everyone is truth? Every time. Or is there something that is true... for everyone? Does it exist? The truth. I don't know. Maybe searching for the truth is wrong. What do you mean? When you start thinking, you start understanding. When you start understanding, you realise... that everyone has their reasons for doing things. But when you understand everyone the difference between the right and the wrong fades away, Coral. Just think, in the search of one true God, in the search for one true God, people have been killing each other for centuries. At one place Allah is God, at another Ram is. That place is our heart, Roy. And, good if it's either Allah or Ram, but if the devil is the God of the heart, is that also right? For those who believe, even the devil is God. Why can't each person's truth be true for himself? It is. We are just not ready to accept it. But why? Maybe because... we are afraid. The truth is like... the ground under our feet. Just like the feet need the ground to walk on. Similarly, to be able to function, the mind needs a truth. The truth, which I now need so badly. I wish there were a place where no society, no man has brought their rights and wrongs. An empty space, where there are no rights or wrongs. Like there is no man's land, Similarly... No man's truth. No man's truth. You... You are not the way... I used to think about you. I am not the way I used to think about myself. And I can't become who I want to be, because of who I used to be. I think it's getting... late. Ok then, I will go. Coral, can you hug me once? I really need it. Coral. Forgive yourself, Roy. Time will heal everything. The ground under my feet, Coral, it's gone. And since then I have been falling into this darkness. I am very scared. I'm very scared, Coral. And I'm tired of being afraid. Don't be afraid, just enjoy the free fall. Yes. I'm under your window. Yes, come down, please. Have you eaten your dinner? I'll call you back. Hello, Hayk. Yes. I just saw Coral, She's running towards our hostel with a knife in her hand. Yes. Quick! Coral, wait! Don't even try to stop me, Hayk! Coral, where are you going? What has happened? What's happened? Calm down, OK? Calm down. Calm down. What has happened? It was him. It was him, Hayk, who killed my sister. Listen, calm down, calm down. It was him, Hayk. It was him. Who was it? Who... Who was it? Listen! Who was it? For a moment I thought it was you. I'm sorry. Forgive me, I thought it was you. Ok, but who was it? It was a suicide, after all. The guy in the picture with Suhana, It was Roy. He killed my sister. How did you get to know this? I saw the birthmark. It was him. Listen, calm down, calm down. I hugged him. I hugged him. -It's OK, it's OK. It's OK, it's OK. I am so angry with myself, I want to stab myself first with the knife... and then him. -Listen, listen. Nothing will happen, You won't do any such thing. If he is really guilty, We'll hand him over to the police, as it's supposed to be. Ok? OK? Ok. Come on, get up. Come on. Listen. Remember, you need to stay calm. If you really kill him, how will we get to know what had happened? Right? Coral? Calm down. It's here. Hayk. Promise me you will not let me do anything wrong. I will always be by your side. Don't be sad now, Don't make your eyes wet. In those silent nights We will come to meet you. In those silent nights, In those lovely talks, I will come back. I will come back. in those rainy evenings, the promises that we made, All the oaths and promises I'll fulfil even if I am dead. The bracelets that I promised to wear on your wrists, I will wear them on your wrists. I will do. I will do. I will do. All the incomplete talks, the promises we've made since ages, I will come and fulfil them. I will come back. When you're in my memory You're in my hopes When you'll spend the nights turning from side to side, In one such night I will come secretly, And I will kiss you... And I will kiss you... And I will kiss you... And I will kiss you. And when the rains fall, together with those rains I will rain down... I will rain down... I will rain down... I will rain down... Holding you in my arms, somewhere in your eyes I'll show you many dreams. I'll show you many dreams. I'll show you many dreams. I'll show you many dreams. I will come back.
