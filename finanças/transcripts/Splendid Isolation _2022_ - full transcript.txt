What am I doing here? What am I doing here? Hello? Is anyone there? I'm somewhere safe they say. This is in the ocean. It's warm. The sun touches my face. You're here. I can see you. Everything will be fine. Dawn, where did you go? Where the hell am I? I know this is stupid, but I don't have any better ideas. I don't know. Maybe I can get someone's attention. It's no different than talking to you in person. You left. I'm sorry, sir. I'm facing the ocean. I swear. This one touches my face. You're here. I could see you. Everything will be fine. Oh. Fuck you. Fuck you. Hello? Hello? Hello! Is anyone over there? Hello! Is anyone over there? Is anyone over there? Clearly. Is it clear? Can you tell me what I'm doing here. I would tell you but I didn't do it. You didn't do what? Did they give you a chair? No, they didn't give me. Who are they? They put us here. Do you know who they are? I don't know their names. OK but-- but you know what they look like? I-- I asked you a question, do you know what they look like? I don't know what you look like. This is going to-- Look, I'm-- listen, let's start with the name. Name? Yeah, as in-- as in your name. It's not very comfortable sitting on the floor, is it? How do you know that I'm sitting on the floor? When you responded to my question about the chair. I don't have a chair. Look, my name is Nell. Hello, fish. Welcome to the barrel. It's-- it's-- it's short for Inelle. That's a strange name I like it. Me too. Travis. OK, Travis, why don't you tell me about that room you're in over there? I guess I'll go first. It's empty. And it's cold. There's no chair. Three of the walls are concrete maybe and one of the walls is drywall I guess. And there's something painted on the wall. It's a-- A number. Yeah. Six. No, it's a nine. The wall I'm at has a big industrial door. Knock, knock. And above it there's a speaker-- Knock, knock. Please cut it out. The sound comes from the horn when the green lights come on. Yeah, and the wall across from me has an LED clock installed. They're both too high to reach. What does your clock read? Right now it's 41 minutes in change. It's counting. It's counting down now. Yeah, the only other things that I have-- Are you comfortable? Why would you ask me that? Travis, Nell. Why would you ask me if I'm comfortable? It's a polite thing to ask. I'm not very comfortable. Right. The only other thing that I have is this-- The rope. Yeah. It's enough to hang myself with. I can't do that anymore. Not now. Why? There's a latch up there on the skylight. They was calling out to me. It's broken now-- the latch. Did you even try to get out of here before you gave up and you decided-- There are a lot of moving parts to this. What does that mean, parts? The room. What is wrong with you? Let's put a pin in that. What happens if I try to climb out of here? The latch won't hold. How hard can it be? You're not understanding me, fish. Yeah, that's an understatement. The latch will not hold. No. What? Do you know how to tie the knot that's tamper proof, one that no one can break for you? You shouldn't do this. That's not the way out. Nell? Nell? I fell. Come closer. Nell, you're still here. Still here? That was right. Yeah, Travis. I think I've done something to my shoulder. Does it hurt? Yeah. You fix it. Find a hard surface, pressure your arm against-- Travis, I'm not listening to another word you say. Travis, I'm not listening to another word you say. Probably best to fix it before the adrenaline wears off. You're welcome. Who are you really? I'm Travis. Did you put me here? No, they did. Are you watching me? I'm listening. Nell, Nell. Travis, you know this song? It's a favorite. Who's it by? Travis, who sings this-- Hello, stranger. Hello to you too. Someone special played that song for me when I was younger I think. Strange it's-- it's comforting. There's something off about it though, something dark. Are you hearing that? Hearing what? Nothing. Never mind. Nell, what are you worrying? Travis, I need to ask you something, and I need you to be honest with me. I only ever tell the truth. Did you put me here in this room? I did not put you in your room. What happens when this clock reaches 0? The lights will turn off. What does that mean? Have you been through this before? Travis, how could that unless you put me here or you've been through this before? Answer me. The lights were shut off when the clock reaches 15 minutes and then the door opens. Yeah. Yeah, that's what happened before. How do I get out of here now? I don't have the answers now, but together you and I can find them. Nell. Travis. How do you feel about being here? I don't-- I feel-- I feel angry. I feel frustrated. I feel abandoned and-- and terrified. I just-- I just feel-- Do you feel like somehow you deserve to be here? I don't know how to answer that. It's a difficult thing to consider, but I feel like I should be here, like I don't deserve to be anywhere else. Why would you say that? I haven't done well. What do you meet? I failed to meet expectations. Let those closest to me down. No one deserves to be put in a place like this, Travis, especially for something as harmless as-- as letting someone down is just it's part of being human. That's funny. What? There are other points of being human that are not so easily forgivable. Like? Like evil. Yeah, it had to take some kind of evil to put me in this room. And that's assuming a human being put us here. Could it mean something else? Divine intervention maybe. You think God put us here? Is His wrath not well cataloged? Punishing those who deserve it with situations fitting their trespasses. God created man and man put us here. So I guess that makes some sense. We're here by God's will and man's hand if you believe and that kind of thing. What are you doing here? Travis, Travis, what's happening over there? What do you want with me? Travis, Travis, Travis. No, no, no, no, no, no. What's happening to you? Travis, please say something. Get away from me. Who's over there with you? Don't please. I'm begging you. Don't. No! Travis, answer me please. Don't! Travis. I'm sweating. I'm somewhere safe. I'm facing the ocean. It's warm. The sun touches my face. I could see you. Everything will be fine. Everything will be fine. Everything is fine, it's fine, it's fine. Travis. Travis, what happened to you? I did it. No, you didn't. You talk to me please. Maybe-- Maybe I can-- maybe we can help each other. There are signs in the sky. Do you see them now? You're hurt. They hurt you. He was here to fix me. He? Who was he, Travis? Did you recognize him? How did he get in here? Nell. Yes, Travis, talk to me. Tell me what happened to you. My head hurts. OK, so he-- so he hits you. He hits you in the head with something, but with what? Travis, Travis, I need you to tell me everything you can about this man, OK? I'm going to help you get out. He said he just wanted to help. By torturing you? Hope for you too. What did he tell you? Travis, what did he say? I'm going to get us out of here, OK? Will you help me with that? But after I get some rest. After you-- no, no, no, no, no. Travis, do not go to sleep. Travis, answer me. I'm here. I'm awake. No way. I think I just-- I just need you to gather your strength and stay awake, OK? I'm going to come up with a plan. I'm going to figure out a way out of here. Stay awake? Yeah. Yes, stay awake, OK? I need you to promise me you'll stay awake. If you feel like you're falling asleep just-- just talk to me. Talk to you? Yeah, yeah, talk to me. I'm an open book. Open book? Yeah, ask me anything. Do you really think I put you here? I did, but now I think we need to work together. Thanks. For what? For caring, for trusting me. I don't really have much of a choice. Why's that? You're all I've got. In here. What? I'm all you have in here. You have someone out there who cares about you. I do. I did. Travis, have you ever-- have you ever lost someone, someone close to you? More than close, irreplaceable. She was the one that-- What happened to her? Did she leave? I'm sorry, I have no business asking you if-- She abandoned me. I was a failure. I lost someone recently. She was there 1 minute and gone the next. It happened that quick. Travis, have you noticed anything strange about yourself, something that guy might have done to us when he put us here? I've got this thing under my skin. Does yours itch? Mine itches. Where did you find yours? My upper arm. Mine's in my leg. Different places. I don't make it easy for him. You remember being put in? I can't remember any of it. Consider yourself lucky. I don't believe in luck, Travis. We're running out of time. I will always have an vent. Travis, Travis, you're not talking to me. You have to stay awake, you promised. Oh, yeah. I think I'm ready for that joke now. Nell, Nell. Sir. Construction. Construction helps. So are we still working on it? Well, worth the wait. It is your own work. Everything will work. I'll go without sleep forever. Travis, Travis, I think I figured out a way to get out of here. Travis, Travis, you're not talking to me. Answer me. It's-- I'm here. I'm awake. Get your broken latch. How's it coming? It's difficult. I know. You're hurt and-- and you're tired. I just-- I need you to focus for me, OK? For both of us. It's much more effective to keep me awake than talking. Travis, Travis, look what I found. It was in the wall. That's true for the bolt. Let me see if I can get a better look from my side. Yeah. Travis, Travis, answer me. Nell. I'm here. Nell, he's going to come back now. You should have left the camera on the wall. Travis, we don't know that. You should have stayed out of the I just need you to stay calm, OK? I just need you to focus on the bolts. I got it. Two more bolts left, halfway there. My latch broke before I could finish. We need to hurry. We're running out of time. Stop what you're doing. Grab hold of your vent and pull as hard as you can. It's bolted up to the concrete. The light's going to come over. He's going to come back. Travis, stay focused. We're almost there. I'm somewhere safe. I'm facing the ocean. It's warm. The sun touches my face. You're in here? Yes. Travis, I'm here. Listen to my voice. I'm here. I know this sounds crazy, but grab the vent and pull as hard as you can. I'll grab the vent and pool. What are you waiting for? Just do it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Travis, Travis, not again, no. I'm somewhere safe. I'm facing the ocean. It's warm. The sun touches my face. You are here. I can see you, everything. No. I'm not safe. I don't even know what safe is. There's no sign here. You're not here. Nothing is fine. What do you want from me? I'll do it. I'll do it. This is what you want? Good. Green's low. Yellow's-- Yellow is medium. It's a sound pressure meter. It's a sound level. Green, yellow, red. Travis. No, no, this is real. No, no, just shoot the wall. Travis, don't shoot yourself. Travis, please don't shoot yourself. Just take your gun shoot something else, something else. If we've done what we're setting out to do, then we've done a difference.

Come on and allow me to introduce you to the-- And this, ladies and gentlemen, is the founder of Chrysalis, Director Dawn Summers. Director Summers is currently overseeing the day to day operations from our new campus which we're currently in transition to. How exciting? Excuse us. Are we going to get to see any of the active trials? Unfortunately, today trials are-- I apologize for that. I want to be sure you were mobilized. Can't be too careful. ah man It sure is pretty out here. It's designed for the trials. It's designed for you. But every once in a while we get to come out here and enjoy it for ourselves. Perks of the job. At any rate, I'm going to start by asking you a series of yes or no questions regarding your experience in the barrel. Who are you? Why are you keeping me here? I'm Edgar and you'll be able to walk again when we're done. So let's-- OK. Question number one, any point in time, did you find the trial to be stressful? Where's Travis? What did you do with him? Just answer the question, please. Yes. Great. Question number two, any point in time did you come to care about the well-being of mod 6 a.k.a. Travis? What kind of question is that? What was the first thing you did when you got out of the room? I-- You didn't run, you doubled back. To help him. Why? Because he would do the same for me. Would he? Look, you were supposed to learn to care about him, you did. That's yes. We're moving on. Next question. Any point in time did you come to-- Where's Dawn? Director Summers? Director Summers is all around us. It's the reason why we're all here. It's actually a giant pain in my ass. Please don't repeat that. What am I saying? You're not going to remember any of this after today anyway. OK, where was I? Any point in time did you come to question your humanity? Oh, that's a new one. My humanity? Yeah, you know, like, I don't know, like if you're a person or a human being or something like that. I don't-- I don't understand what you're asking me. You just let him die. You just watched as he-- Residue probably from a fall earlier. No, we'll get in there and clean that up. OK, like I was saying, at any point in time did you come to question your-- Who am I? --humanity, right? That's a yes, OK. Next question. Have I been here before? Yeah, day after day, week after week until they work out all the bugs and move on to mod 10. I'll decide when the time is right. Piece of shit. Come on now. All right, we're back up and running. This isn't fair. Have I ever been able to save him? No, it's not fair. He's having two mortgages and paying child support on a kid you're not even sure as yours, that's not fair. I wish somebody would save me. You're somewhere safe. I want to be saved. Hey. I can see the ocean. Look, you have to answer all of these questions or they're going to repurpose you like they did to him. It's warm. The sun touches my face. I'm somewhere safe. Alright. I'm facing the ocean. I got my kids this weekend, I can't be late. I'm just going to docker and we'll pick it up on Monday. It's warm. The sun touches my face. I'm somewhere safe. I'm facing the ocean. It's warm.
