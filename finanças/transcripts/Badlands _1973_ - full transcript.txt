[Holly narrates] My mother died of pneumonia when I was just a kid. My father had kept their wedding cake in the freezer for ten whole years. After the funeral he gave it to the yard man. He tried to act cheerful but he could never be consoled by the little stranger he found in his house. Then one day hoping to begin a new life away from the scene of all his memories he moved us from Texas to Fort Dupree, South Dakota. [Dustbin lorry's compactor whirs] I'll give you a dollar to eat this collie. I ain't gonna eat it for a dollar. I don't think he's a collie either. Some kinda dog though. Watch your head. Hey Woody gimme a cigarette. Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette. Ever notice he don't talk much? Yeah he's not a talker. You got that. Little did I realize that what began in the alleys and back ways of this quiet town would end in the badlands of Montana. - No, no they wouldn't fit. - How do you know you haven't tried 'em on. - I know. What size are they? - Your size. - Come on gimme a dollar for 'em. - No. Cost 20 new. Why don't you see if they fit you? [Dog barks] [Kit whistles] This lady don't ever pay her bills. She gonna get in trouble if she doesn't watch out. [Dustbin clatters] I throwed enough trash for today Cato. I'll see you in the morning. Catch. What do you mean? [Pleasant music begins] Hi I'm Kit. - I'm not keeping you from anything important am I? - No. Just thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine. Holly. Well listen Holly you er, I don't know want to take a walk with me? What for? Oh I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kinda lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds do they? Oh incidentally my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like Yourothers hey? It's okay. Yeah well nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me. You still in school? Nah, I got me a job. Doing what? Well I don't mind getting up early so I got a job throwing garbage. Holly's dad: Holly! - I'm not in love with the stuff okay? - That's my father I gotta run. - Hey wait. When am I gonna see you again? Well I know what my dad's gonna say. - What? - Can I be honest? Sure. Well that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage. - He'll say that? - Yeah. Now what's he know about garbage huh? - Nothing. - There you go. Well I mean there's nothing he wants to know. I gotta run. Who was that? Just some boy. Is that gonna kill the grass? [Holly laughs] You got some on my feet. What did he want? He was just asking if we needed any yard work done. I said no and for him not to bother us. Heard the news Kit? - No. - Been in all the headlines. - What's that? - You've been fired. Ain't that a hell of a note? Yeah how about that? Oh I won't be needing my keys anymore. I'll just leave 'em where they'll be nice and handy. I've got my dog. [Typewriter keys clacking] Interviewer: Have you ever held another job before? Yeah I used to throw trash for the city. And you lost that one? Yeah I wouldn't be here if I hadn't. Why did you leave? Just felt like it. What kind of work do you think you'd be qualified for? I just got to get this. Well I can't think of anything at the moment. I want you to write me out a slip though proving I came down here. I think we can get you something working cattle over at the pens. Well what the hell. Just hope there's a breeze. He was handsomer than anybody I'd ever met. He looked just like James Dean. - Hi. - Well stop the world. - Hey quit my job. - Great. Seemed like the right move. What you doing? Spanish. How do you say "quit my job" in Spanish? Something mi trabajo. Well I'm gonna to work as a cowboy now. Thinking about it. It's a routine like anything. - What do you think? - I don't know. Yeah well at least nobody can get on me about wearing these boots anymore. You wanna go for a ride? Well I got homework. Bring it along. Somebody dropped a bag on the sidewalk. If everybody did that the whole town would be a mess. [Child talks indistinctly] Hi. - You're a redhead. - I know. Anybody ever call you Red? - Yeah but I don't like it. - Why not?

Little by little we fell in love. As I'd never been popular in school and didn't have a lot of personality I was surprised that he took such a liking to me. Especially when he coulda had any other girl in town if he'd given it half a try. He said that I was grand though, that he wasn't interested in me for sex and that coming from him this was a compliment. He'd never met a 15 year old girl who behaved more like a grown up and wasn't giggly. He didn't care what anybody else thought. I looked good to him and whatever I did was okay. And if I didn't have a lot to say well that was okay too. What a nice place. Yeah the tree makes it nice. And the flowers. Let's not pick 'em. They're so nice. It's your play. Of course I had to keep all this a secret from my dad. He woulda had a fit since Kit was ten years older than me and came from the wrong side of the tracks, so called. Our time with each other was limited and each lived for the precious hours when he or she could be with the other away from all the cares of the world. My stomach's growling. [People chattering in the distance] There's an old Fudgsicle. You want it? No. Somebody else is gonna get it. [Holly laughs] I don't care. Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea. In the stench and slime of the feed lot he'd remember how I'd looked the night before. How I ran my hand through his hair and traced the outline of his lips with my finger tip. He wanted to die with me and I dreamed of being lost forever in his arms. The whole time the only thing I did wrong was throwing out my fish when he got sick. Later I got a new one but this incident kept on bothering me and I turned to Kit. Well he was sick. You couldn't do much about that. - I guess not. - So? Well it scared me. Ah don't worry about it. I didn't mind telling Kit about stuff like this 'cause strange things happened in his life too. And some of the stuff he did was strange. For instance he faked his signature whenever he used it to keep other people from forging important papers with his name. And as he lay in bed in the middle of the night he always heard a noise like somebody was holding a seashell against his ear. And sometimes he'd see me coming toward him in beautiful white robes and I'd put my cold hand on his forehead. Did it go the way it's supposed to? Yeah. - Is that all there is to it? - Yep. Gosh what was everybody talking about? Don't ask me. Well I'm glad it's over. For awhile I was afraid I might die before it happened. Had a wreck or some deal like that. See where that tree fell in the water? Yeah. River must've washed the roots away. You don't care about anything I say though. - You know what I think? - What? We should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today. - But it would hurt. - Well that's the point stupid. Don't call me stupid. Okay but I'm gonna keep it for a souvenir. Well maybe one that's lighter. Kit made a solemn vow he would always stand beside me and let nothing come between us. He wrote this out in writing, put the paper in a box with some of our little tokens and things. Then sent it off in a balloon he'd found while on the garbage route. His heart was filled with longing as he watched it drift off. Something must've told him we'd never live these days of happiness again. That they were gone forever. [Gentle music plays] Then sure enough dad found out I'd been running around behind his back. He was madder than I'd ever seen him. As punishment for deceiving him, he went and shot my dog. He made me take extra music lessons everyday after school and wait there till he came to pick me up. He said that if the piano didn't keep me off the streets maybe the clarinet would. Sure is pretty. What did you come out here for? I wasn't aware there was any law against it. You know Holly? Well she means an awful lot to me sir. You know before I met her nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact I didn't really have one. Is that right? Yeah. It okay me leaning on your Willys here? Look I got a lot of respect for her too sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you. Well it's not good enough. What do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you Kit? - A guy like you? - She'd get along okay. And if she didn't why she could just take off. Just take right on off. I wouldn't mind. I always tell people I deserve it. I don't want you hanging around anymore. I don't wanna see you again. Understand? You something. Takes all kinds sir. [Kit knocks on door] Hi. What are you doing? I got a gun here sir. It's always a good idea to have one around. What do you think you're doing? Go on get outta here. [Kit sighs] I got it all planned and er I'm taking Holly off with me. Okay boy. I'm turning you over to the authorities. - What for? - Coming onto my property with a gun. No you're not either. Yeah why not? 'Cause I can't allow it. Hey! Hey wait a minute! Suppose I shot you how'd that be huh? Want to hear what it sounds like? [Kits gun fires loudly] - Kit. Kit! - Hey where are you going?

Now and then we'd sneak out at night and steal a chicken or a bunch of corn or some melons from a melon patch.

At dawn just before 6:00 Torstein came hurrying down from the mast head. He could see a whole line of small palm clad islands far ahead. ♫ Familiar music returns ♪ I grew to love the forest. The cooing of the doves and the hum of dragonflies in the air made it always seem lonesome, like everybody's dead and gone. When the leaves rustled overhead it was like the spirits were whispering about all the little things that bothered 'em. One day while taking a look at some vistas in dads stereopticon it hit me that I was just this little girl born in Texas. Whose father was a sign painter, who had only just so many years to live. It sent a chill down my spine and I thought. Where would I be this very moment if Kit had never met me or killed anybody? This very moment. If my mum had never met my dad. If she had never died and what's the man I'll marry gonna look like? What's he doing right this minute? Is he thinking about me now by some coincidence even though he doesn't know me?

He claimed that as long as you're playing for keeps and the law's coming at ya it's considered okay to shoot all witnesses. You had to take the consequences though and not whine about it later. He never seemed like a violent person before except for once when he said he'd like to rub out a couple of guys. whose names he didn't care to mention.

My clarinet teacher said I probably wasn't responsible but others said I was. Then on Thursday the governor of Oklahoma sent out the National Guard to stand watch at the Federal Reserve Bank in Tulsa when word got out that Kit meant to rob it.

Stranger speaking: Well what I got I can't spare. Just a second now. That's your truck in't it? - You didn't walk out here. - It's mine alright. Well listen I'm gonna swap you my Cadillac. Now don't worry you're getting a fair deal. Hell ask anybody. What's the Blue Book value on this thing Mildred? Stranger: Who are you? The name's Carruthers.

Boy I had a feeling today was gonna be the day. - Helicopter. - Yeah. He's not gonna take us for any ride. Come on let's make a run for the car. I don't want to. Have you got a better idea?

[Patrol car tyres squeal] [Horn toots] [Shoots pistol] [Kits car accelerates] [Engine accelerates] [Cattle moo, horn honks] [Cattle fence pings] [Shots fired] [Bullets fly] [Tyres screech] [Silence returns to the road] Holly narrates: Many times I've wondered what was going through Kits head before they got him. And why he didn't make a run for it while he still had the chance. Did he figure they'd just catch him the next day? Was it despair? He claimed to having a flat tyre but the way he carried on about it I imagine this is false. [Gunshot] [Stones clatter] [Sound of distant patrol car approaching] [Tyres squeal] Hi. Hold it right there. I could have held off an army if I coulda got behind a boulder up in the mountains. - Oh yeah? - As long as my ammo held out. Right there is where you caught me. We did it Ray. You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here. Put your hands on back of your head. Now put the other one on yourself. [Handcuffs click] Hell he ain't no bigger than I am. Look at that. You're gonna give me a cauliflower ear sheriff. He should've thought about that before he got caught shouldn't he? [Gunshot] Think I'll take the juice? Beats me. Say what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me? Thirty o six. You ever had to open up like that before? No. Well you boys have performed like a couple of heroes and don't think I'm not gonna pass it around when we get to town. You tossed my hat out the window. Wanna sue me? - No. - Kit? Kit I got a question for you. - You like people? - They're okay. Then why'd you do it? I don't know. I always wanted to be a criminal I guess. Just not this big of one. Takes all kinds though. You know who that son of a bitch looks like? - You know don't you? - No. I'll kiss your arse if he don't look like James Dean. [Train rattles by] How you doing there Kit? Fine as can be expected. Just locked up, can't move. - Nice little coat you got on there. - You think? It's leather. Hey now looky here. Here's the real prize. I must've had this about ten years. Looky there. - Who's gonna get it? - Give me that son of a bitch. - There you go. - Where are you from? - South Dakota, where you from? - Here. Want a comb? Joni James is from South Dakota. Yeah I know she got outta there too. Kit who's your favourite singer? - Eddie Fisher, who's yours? - Eddie Fisher. Damn you want a pen? How old are you? Don't you read the papers? - Have you ever been married? - No I haven't. - Hey Kit? - Yep? You afraid of death? I haven't thought about it much. [Men laugh and chat] [Indistinct conversations] Hey Tom I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching some. - What do you say now? - We need to get your signature on some paperwork here Kit. Well I'll have to read it first. Suppose I could get a coke while I do? Sure thing. - You boys keep out of trouble. - Don't worry about us. Holly's over here Kit if you want to see her. Sure. I gave him the papers to sign. I'm gonna get him a coke. You gonna give me a little slack here? Hi. And push! Don't worry now I'm gonna get you off these charges. There's a whole lot of other boys out there waiting for you and you're gonna have a lot of fun. Boy we rang the bell didn't we? I'll say this though. That guy with the deaf maid he's just lucky he's not dead too. 'Course er too bad about your dad. Yeah. We're gonna have to sit down and talk about that sometime. [Plane tyres screech] [Pickup engine screeches] [Plane engine clatters] [Troops chat amongst themselves] There you go... - Thank you. - Thank you very much chief Sims. - Sorry if I caused you any inconvenience. - You didn't cause me any trouble. Thanks anyway. Well. - Kit. - Tom. - Good luck to you. - Thank you. - I know you mean it. - Good luck to you too. - Now we go. - Okay thank you. Come on Red. [Tranquil music begins] Holly narrates: Kit and I were taken back to South Dakota. They kept him in solitary so he didn't have a chance to get acquainted with the other inmates. Though sure they'd like him, especially the murderers. Myself I got off with probation and a lot of nasty looks. Later I married the son of the lawyer who defended me. Kit went to sleep in the courtroom while his confession was being read and he was sentenced to die in the electric chair. On a warm spring night six months later after donating his body to science, he did. Sir where'd you get that hat? State. Boy I'd like to buy me one of them. You're quite an individual Kit. Think they'll take that into consideration? [Music returns as film ends]
