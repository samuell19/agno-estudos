I'll staple that hat to your head if you can't keep it on. We'll be in proximity to me. That means kind of close to me. It's from the Latin. You take Latin, don't ya? ROUDY: My name is Thomas Alta Roudebush, but many people call me "Sir." Anyway, my name is Roudy, but that's R-O-U-D-Y. I'm kind of the last cowboy around Telluride. The others just pass through. That's good, girls. Easy, now. Come on, cows. ROUDY: You get a horse that trusts you, and you have a wonderful thing. A lifelong relationship that isn't gonna let you down and go away sometime. These mountains are an inspiration to me on a daily basis. You feel deep roots when you live on the continental divide for 30 years. It's the backbone of the world. Maybe it makes me stronger just looking at it. As I get older, I have more questions. But I don't care so much about the answers. It's more the matter of... the pondering is what I enjoy. These are wild animals, these elk. And it's taken me 16 years to get them to trust me, not much, but enough that I can ride up to them on horses, which they're not as fearful of. It's all right, girls. It's just me. Whenever I start to scare 'em, I turn my side to 'em so I'm a prey animal, too. And then they, and they look at me and go, "Oh. "He's just that guy that talks all the time." "There's nothing scary about old Roudy." ROUDY: I want the horse calmed down, not fired up. What you're doing is the opposite of what I asked you to do. What have I done for Roudy today? Or better, what have I done for Roudy in the past few seconds? All day long I think that. Nonstop. MAN: I came here in April and asked Roudy, did he need any help? His only one question was, "You don't cry easy, do ya?" Much as I hide it, I really enjoy harassing these young people every day of their lives. He's good with the horses, though, and he loves us all. He's just not sure how to say it all the time. ROUDY: Recently someone said, "What's new in your life?" And I was able to say, "Well, I'm sober!" So that's a new thing for me. And interesting work, sobriety. I certainly gave alcohol every chance to be the right way to go. Cindy, girl. There you go. In Wisconsin, where I was raised, no one mentioned that if you drank a case of beer every day for 30 years, it would become addicting. (COUGHING) There's water in that! I can still be a big tipper. I'm always telling her that even though there's no alcohol in these glasses, I still want 'em. A lot of 'em. As long as I can exercise my arm. He's gonna be in the bars forever. I'd love to have a drink. Comin' in here to see his old friends. Whether he drinks or not, makes no difference. And that was probably the reason I quit the alcohol, is to have more freedom. And that's what I got. A whole lot more freedom than I used to have. God, I'd have less rules. We've experienced being free and unfettered human beings here because there aren't many people and there isn't much government. And so it's hard to have your freedoms even infringed a little bit. Cherish your freedom. (NEIGHING) (GROWLING) MARC: This land that we're on has been in my family for 250 years. My children are the seventh generation living on this property. They live in their great-grandfather's home. In fact, I feel so connected to this land that at night, sometimes, I come out here and I can almost see my ancestors' ghosts floating around here. (PLAYING FOLK MUSIC) MARC: My name is Marc Savoy, and I'm a reincarnated Neanderthal that's been sent back to play Cajun music for the world. You know, you start off with a big bowl of hot water. And if you just try to taste that, it doesn't taste very well. But if you add a few notes and a few spices here and there and a few embellishments, before long, you've got a gumbo. Or a two-step. And that's pretty much what it's all about. People should look back and say, "Hey, where do I come from?" "What makes me unique? What makes me special?" "What language did my ancestors speak?" (SINGING CAJUN) It's not just, you know, one kind of food, or one kind of music, or one kind of landscape. It's the wonderful diversity of this country that makes this place so great. That's it. It's gonna be all right. Oh, yeah.

And I would cook the last meal at night, and go to bed, and say my prayers. And the next mornin', before daylight, somebody would be knocking on the door and sayin', "Mosie, here's some chicken," or, "Here's some bread." And I would just praise the Lord for that. And as they grew up and they married off in my yard, and I received happy cards, I have mementoes in my house that I get each time, because I'm their mom. My mom was a great mom. I became a great mother. I am a great mother. MOSIE: I first connected to music when I was about three years old.

My grandmother, Effie Ella, she brought with her a little rosewood box. In that box she had flaxseed, some needles, a little pair of scissors, just the necessities. What else she brought with her was the knowledge of how to build looms, and spinning wheels, and cradles. How to give birth to her own children, and how to live off the land. That's what I inherited. This is where I learned to listen. Most people pray, and they're doing the talkin'. But when I weave, I must listen. And it quietens my head so I can hear myself. And I can know what separates the wheat from the chaff in my thoughts. And Albert does that in the field, plowin' the field. He works in rows, and I work in rows of fabric. Weavin' back and forth, just like he does. He doesn't have a boss. Nobody tells him to go out there. 8:00 every morning, start his tractor and plow. He decides. That's called self-discipline. I have to learn that. If I've woven ten feet into this rug and it still doesn't say, "yes," I'll cut it right off the loom and start again. Forget that. Poverty is not a word to a true Appalachian. I mean, don't be afraid of having nothing. Because look, you're all you've got. What else do you need? That's what it's about, the transmission of the culture. I've been broke many times, but I've never been poor. MINNIE: A man come to me one time and he said, "How do you know you're a mountain person?" I said, "Well, cut me open right here, "and just pull that back and look right in there. "You won't see a heart. "What you'll see is a mountain range a mist hanging in the hills. "That's my heart." GEORGE: Bacon and eggs all right for breakfast, Henry? HENRY: Sure. That's good, 'cause that's what we're gettin'. GEORGE: My name is George Woodard, and I've got a small dairy farm in middle-of-the-state Vermont, which is over on the east side of the country there. If you're lookin' at a map, it's on the right. Hey, you know what? What? Your mouse has got five legs. Huh? Oh, yeah... Oh, no. Oh... Oh. I put that as a tail. I forgot. I thought that was a leg. Oh. Better erase one of them tails, huh? Well, this farm was bought by my grandfather in 1912. And, he farmed it until my father and mother took over in '46, after World War II. In '75, when I got out of school, I couldn't figure on what to do. And we had this farm, you see. So I decided, "Well, you know, "maybe I'll raise up a bunch of calves, milk cows." So that was 25 years ago and I'm still here. How about that? Hey, look at my milk stool. That's pretty good, huh? Don't come much better than that. If you got this cow over here, you got the machine on. You got this cow over here, and you're startin' like this. That machine happens to fall off, you just whip around, quick. Grab that, quick! Just like that! Yeah, that's pretty good. GEORGE: Thing about workin' seven days a week is, you don't have to worry going back to work on Monday when Sunday comes. Don't dread it, you know? GEORGE: One of the great things about havin' a small farm is you get to see your child grow up. You don't send them to daycare and that kind of thing. You know, I have my son half the time, every other week. He's here with me all day, and it's just delightful. Just watchin' him grow up here and... Look how he's over there with that cow. It's just a beautiful thing. Just beautiful. He's a good boy. He plays fiddle, takes fiddle lessons. He doesn't like it, but he does it anyway, you know. (PLAYING FIDDLE) GEORGE: Once more! (LAUGHING) I love that! BOTH: ♪ Someday, I'm gonna climb ♪ Up and down the other side of the mountain ♪ Someday, I'm gonna fly ♪ Somewhere over the rainbow ♪ And I'm gonna make my dreams come true ♪ La-da-da, da deedle-dee dee-dee ♪ La-da-da da deedle-dee dee-dee ♪ And I'm gonna make my dreams come true ♪ Yes. All right. Okay, another good one you've written there, George. What do you mean, another? It's the only one I ever wrote. GEORGE: For the last three years, I've kind of delved into a little bit of film directing, using my nephews and nieces and my son. But hold on that for a couple of seconds so that we can cut in the middle of it. Okay? And... Action! I try to create stories around what I've got right here, to keep my expenses down. For instance, this is just a set that I threw up in my hay barn here. Cut. Good. One take. It is fun to watch the whole thing come together, with everybody participating. I'm in a production called "Dracula: The Musical." (GRUNTING) (PEOPLE LAUGHING) He's got a great sense of humor. Come, my darling. Come, take my hand. Let's fly away. WOMAN: He'll do a whole performance, and then go home and milk the cows. MAN: Tear the set down. WOMAN: Mmm-hmm. Go home to milk. Go home to milk. And do it again the next day. ♪ I ain't sayin' that my life is bad, ♪ But Lord I wish that I only had the comforts ♪ That they can't build in machines ♪ There was a period of time when he left the farm and went out west, went out to California. I loved LA. I loved it. It was great. But this works on a small scale, and that seems to be enough. For me, anyway. GEORGE: ♪ Clothes out dryin' on an old clothesline ♪ Fishin' on the lake with a friend of mine ♪ GEORGE: There's nothin' more important than watchin' your children grow up. Learn new things every day. I just love it more than anything else. (EXCLAIMING) I was a short-order cook. Uh, got fired from that. I was a baker's helper. Got fired from that. BEN: Jerry and I, we were failing at most everything else we were trying. We decided to go into business, and the only thing we liked doing was eating. I think we got possibilities here. I like this combination. You have a great business when the goal of the business is to meet the need, is to create the product, not to make money. You make money as a byproduct of meeting a need and doing a great job of it. What? Am I still dripping? You know, I'm a professional. I'm an executive. You know, it's important to keep your image up. We'll probably be goin' down around about a mile and a half. I'd say that's somewhere around 8,000 feet. Watch your heads right here, fellas. It's a low spot. MAN: Coal is a polluting resource, but it's also a resource that put the beans on the table all my life. (SINGING OPERA) MAN: A handmade hat is much better than a mass-produced hat because, you know, it's like maintaining an art. I think hats are just my way of speaking to the world. MAN: Anything will hold you up off the floor. But a really good chair, it feels good to look at, it feels good to sit in, and it feels good to be a part of somethin' that you believe in. For me, that's worth a lot more than the pay I get. ED: Every once in a while you get this time in your life that's sealed, signed and delivered, and it'll be there forever. And one of those times, for me, was when I was probably in third or fourth grade. And I asked my mom for money, and she had no money. And that broke my heart, and I never asked her again. And I went to work. And that's how I got to where I am today. I started working and I never stopped. I love growing grapes. I'm pretty good at it. And I'm gettin' better every year. It's a matter of frustration. It's a matter of patience. You can't learn how to grow grapes in 25 or 30 years. I think it takes a lifetime. Every year, the whole thing starts over again. And we're powerless to create spring, or summer, or fall. And that's pretty amazing. So maybe that's what livin' out in the country and livin' on a ranch like this does to a guy. It just puts you in the middle of God's glory. One of the first miracles, if you believe in God, is where Jesus was at a wedding, and he turned the water into wine, and that, to me, is pretty neat. Why was that his first choice? It's because he liked to drink. Just like me. (LAUGHING) Yeah, that's very good. I think finding your passion in life is important, and I'm lucky enough to have found that. I started out just drinkin' a lot of beer and chasing women, you know? I don't think you have a plan for it. I think it just happens. And I think, for me, I believe it's in the vineyard. That's what got me started, and that's where I'd like to end up. I want to die in a vineyard, workin' the grapes. That's my retirement plan. ACE: When I first came to the oil field in '49, I was workin' for a drillin' contractor. And we had a little explosion on a rig one time. I burned my old head a little bit. Few years later, I decided the best thing to do would be workin' for some company that put fires out, instead of being on a rig where they started. You know, you're only old as you feel. Some mornings when I get up, I feel about 120. But at about 9:30 the next night, I feel about 35. My name is Ace Barnes and I'm 70 years old. My children did not follow me in my footsteps. First of all, they couldn't keep up. And second of all, there's a better way of making a living. It's muddy and the dozer's gettin' stuck and the pipe won't drag straight. Teamwork is very important because it's pretty hard to eat a pile of hay when two mules are goin' in opposite directions. You get to think about the supreme being when you're gettin' near one of these big, ragin' fires. JAMES: Every time I go on a job, my little one, I think he worries about Dad. He brings it up every once in a while about one of my partners who was killed in Syria. There was a huge ground fire, and they just couldn't get out of it. And he was just, you know, like a second father to him. And so, I know it's in the back of his mind and he don't mention it much, but, sure, it bothers him, but he knows his dad's a professional. And he's seen me go, and he's seen me come back. So, he knows Daddy will always come back. Sooner or later, we're gonna win this fight. ACE: We finally got the mother cap. And it went just slick as a whistle. Like takin' candy from a baby. We're just common folk. We're oil-well firefighters. MAN 1: There always was a sense of pride in servin' your country for the ideals that it was founded on. MAN 2: We've taken our fight to Washington, and so far, we've pretty much fallen on deaf ears. MAN 3: We simply cannot compete against 25-cent-an-hour labor that some of these foreign countries pay their workers. ANDY: It's not right what they're doin'. I mean, I'm 45 years old. It'll be rough for me to start over again. If these mills go down, this town will be dead. I don't know, I don't know what the answer is, but I know the answer is not quitting. MAN 1: In 1984, National Steel decided to shed Weirton Steel from their corporation. MAN 2: At the time of the announcement the employees at Weirton were shocked. There was a lot of disbelief. MAN 1: The employees pulled together and made a gallant effort to purchase the company and become employee owners. We all bought our jobs. We bought our pensions. We bought our healthcare benefits. We have employees with ten, 15 years of service that depend on the healthcare that Weirton Steel provides. One example I can give you is a coworker, his name's Andy Kamarec. And he has a young six-year-old daughter that's had brain surgery twice. The tumor is coming back, and if this place fails and the people at Weirton Steel lose their benefits, it'll just be a disaster. MAN 1: The sad part about all this is our steel mills and our steel workers in this country are the most efficient and the most environmentally friendly in the world. But yet, it's our jobs being taken away. And that's hard to swallow. I believe, in order to survive, there has to be a great deal of inner strength that comes from the employees. Many of us have an ethnic background. When we were growing up, our parents would not accept anything but 100% effort. If we're given a fair chance, we'll do whatever it takes to survive. ♪ I knew this girl who couldn't read my face ♪ I'm 21 and she thought I was 28 ♪ I'm freakin' out 'cause I've been runnin' for a while Waltham's music was created initially by my brother David. ♪ Come and take a ride ♪ Be with someone else ♪ Come and take a ride ♪ Yeah, be with someone else DAVID: Being in a band for 10 years, we've done a lot of styles of music and we've done a lot of different sounds and everything like that. We always wanted to be a heavy-metal band. That's been our dream, to be like Pantera. But we're just not that tough. ♪ Wake up, wake up ♪ Wake up, wake up ♪ DAVID: The inspiration comes from being in high school, seeing the girl of your dreams, memorizing exactly what period you're gonna be walking by her in the hall. Just basically the sweat that you have being a loser. At one point being a winner, hopefully. A lot of bands wear Dickies 'cause they think it's cool. But they don't wear it right. They don't wear the, like, work Dickies. They go and find the name, "Ooh, Dickie, it's cool." And they put on these big, baggy pants. And that's not what Dickie's all about. Dickie means you got to go to work, your job makes you wear 'em. DAVID: Workin' in a carwash is the greatest lifestyle. It's everything I went to college for. All right, man. You have a nice day. I sit around. I play my guitar. I watch Fast Times at Ridgemont High every single day, two times a day. All right, now. This is where all the magic happens in the carwash. This is where all the hydraulic engines are and all the boilers and everything. The beauty behind all of this is that I don't know what it all is. My boss doesn't want me to know what it is. Therefore I don't have to fix it when it breaks. That's why my job is so awesome. We got barrels over here with chemicals that are real harmful, but they clean the car somehow. All right, if you ever walk around your car and you notice your front license plate is missing, chances are it's at the carwash in your town. Well, I drive a truck during the day, just until my music career takes off. I enjoy it because I'm by myself. And I can sing to myself. I come up with different facial expressions that I practice in my rearview mirror. This is the "I'm sensitive but I also have a hard side." This is my "Hey. Everything's cool. I can hang with you. "I can even hang with your boyfriend, too." FRANK: None of us have peaked yet. So since we haven't peaked yet, we can't stop the band yet. We weren't, like, varsity jocks in high school. Those guys peaked. They're having keg stands, and they're done. Yeah. We're not done yet. We're "never wases." I never did anything to the best of my ability in school. So, my dream is just to be successful enough where I can bring a gold record or a platinum record home and give it to my mother and my father and be like, "Ma and Pops, look. "This is, this is like my diploma. And we did it, "and all this time didn't go to waste. "Just pretend that I was in music college for 10 years." (HORNS HONKING) I love goin' fast. I love swoopin' around corners, too. You get the spectators like, "Oh, wow. Look at that guy!" You feel like Batman or Spider-Man a little bit. Excuse me. My name is John Yacobellis Everybody calls me "Yac." Been a bicycle messenger for 10 years. Our clients definitely appreciate the speed that we get their packages to them, 'cause a lot of their stuff revolves around their time. I hate waiting for elevators. Takes up so much of my time. Probably four or five hours during the week. I get paid commission as a messenger. That's per package. Per delivery. On a really good day, I can make upwards of $200. And a really bad day, around 50 bucks. Those are really bad days. Morning. They look a little hungry. Here you go, guys. Thank you. Have a good day. Thanks. Bye. Sometimes we gotta eat on the run. We have no time. Packages have to get there. I usually eat about three or four doughnuts a day. Couple of bagels. And then I start on lunch. Some of the taxi drivers, you hold onto the side of the cab. You know, to get a running start when we have to stop at the lights. And we're not really supposed to, but they let us. Bike messenger, it's not bad. Sometimes they give you heart attack. I trained for a few years in the Navy, in the SEAL program. It takes a certain amount of toughness to be a bike messenger. If you ride like me, you're gonna get into some pretty scary situations. (BRAKES SCREECHING) YAC: You know, people are dartin' in and out of cars and those doors fly open. Whoa. Sorry, dude. Over the years I've developed reflexes where I can reach over my handle bars and close the door if it's opening on me. The Alley Cat Races that we have in New York are arranged by messengers. Usually get a small prize like a messenger bag or, you know, a few dollars. I'm usually at the front of the line, trying to win. I don't go out to come in second place. Second place is the first loser. Yac? Well, the obvious is that any big race he comes to, he's gonna win it. Like, he doesn't just race like you know, like road races, like, you know, you see these guys wearin' spandex, all twinkied up, from head to toe, riding through Central Park thinking they're bad. You know, Yac can rock it on the ten-speed, on the road race... He can rock it on the mountain-bike race. You know, he's, like, multiskilled. YAC: New York's a tough city. I get hassled by people on a daily basis, calling me nasty names and trying to start fights with me. Stupid stuff like that. MAN: Yac's, he's a good guy. In the basic Brooklyn-Queens meaning of the word, he's a good fella. He's always got your back in a fight. He'll always help you if your bike's busted. If there's something you can't fix and he's around, he'll take a look at it, use his mechanical skills to help you out. He's crowned king of New York City messengers. Hope you like New York. Gotta go. Thank you. (PLAYING TRUMPET AND TROMBONE) JAMES: My family is a New Orleans musical family. My grandfather's name was "Ooh-Poo-Pah-Doo" Jessie Hill. He was a legend of the rhythm and blues, New Orleans style. And he played with Fats Domino and Professor Longhair. My brother's name is Trombone Shorty. He plays trombone. MAN: Let's bring him down! This is Satchmo from the ghetto. We're gonna sack a line to y'all right now, "Hello, World." Me and Trombone Shorty and our Lone Stars from New Orleans. (BAND PLAYING) Come on, y'all. (BAND PLAYING) JAMES: My name is James Andrews. This is my neighborhood and these are my people. In New Orleans, that's the way of life for us to play by feeling and put our heart and soul into it. My brother's name was D-Boy Darnell Andrews. He was murdered about three years ago in New Orleans, not too far from here. And we dedicated an album titled "D-Boy" to him, acknowledging his memories. That was the most tragic time in my life. In the period with my family, and we all come together. And the most important thing for me in my life is passing it on to the children. That's how I overcomed everything by passing it on to another person. (BAND PLAYING) JAMES: We just love each other and he's my best friend. And also, it's kind of wonderful for me to be able to influence my little brother and introduce him to life, and see the world. ♪ Hey now, you're an all star ♪ Get your game on, go play ♪ Hey now, you're a rock star ♪ Get the show on, get paid ♪ All that glitters is gold ♪ Only shooting stars ♪ Somebody once asked ♪ Could I spare some change for gas ♪ I need to get myself away from this place ♪ I said, yep, what a concept ♪ I could use a little fuel myself ♪ And we could all use a little change ♪ Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin' ♪ Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin' ♪ Didn't make sense not to live for fun ♪ Your brain gets smart, but your head gets dumb ♪ So much to do, so much to see ♪ So what's wrong with taking the back streets? ♪ You'll never know if you don't go ♪ You'll never shine if you don't glow ♪ Hey now, you're an all star ♪ Get your game on, go play ♪ Hey now, you're a rock star ♪ Get the show on, get paid ♪ All that glitters is gold ♪ Only shootin' stars break the mold ♪ It's the only way to go, 'cause you're not gonna be here very long. Love is the drug. WOMAN: It's called "Come play with me," and so everything on it is interactive or musical or both. My grandkids love this. In fact, when I take Chelsea to school or to pick her up, all the kids are, "Wow! That's your grandma's car?" So I started by painting a rooster on the door, and gradually added more objects. And suddenly, I had an identity. Everybody keeps saying, "You've got everything "on there but the kitchen sink." And I can honestly say I do have the kitchen sink now. MAN: In this particular case I thought, "If Jesus came back "and there was a second coming, "what kind of car would he want to have?" Oh, it's just fun. I wish I got a dime for every smile. I'd be wealthy. WOMAN: People that take their cars on the road are taking another part of them on the road. It's magic. It's all about creating magic. Life's too short. People say, "I was in a bad mood and I saw your car, "and I just started smiling, and it just made me happy." And when I see them smile then it takes me out of a bad mood, if I'm in a bad mood. So, it's very therapeutic. Actually, I'm a therapist. MAN: How many people have ever experienced pure freedom? I've worked hard all my life, but now I'm doing what I want to do. You know, I can go anywhere I want. I follow the sun. I don't like being cold. More than anything, it's just the pure enjoyment of being able to see people really appreciating what I do. What can be more satisfying than that? (WHISTLE BLOWING) PAUL: Too little time and too many things to blow up. We all came to Creede, which is America's only open-air asylum. MAN: We house, in our community, some characters from the outside world. We never really turn anybody away, unless they turn into something so bad we can't tolerate. It gets kind of slow up here, to say the least. It gets a little, little boring. Kind of like The Shining. Like, "Here's Johnny." It's just a nice place to live without problems. PAUL: We create our own entertainment, our own fun. I'm gonna drop this in here. And it might go off, but I don't think it will. But, kind of, just duck. Oh, beautiful. Aiming. Yeah. I'd get out of the way, too, if I were you. Okay, I'm ready. Here we go. Whoo! Look at that. Bull's-eye. Let the teeth of your pig corer do the work. Work that baby down there into your ham to cut out your ham bullet.

Take my ham core, my heart of ham, then I'm gonna ram the ham home. Ready, aim, fire. Here's a piece of bread, here's a chopped piece of ham... Mmm. It is really good. It's a lot warmer than it was this morning. Now it's 18 degrees below zero. This wacky stuff comes from a real hot shower in the morning, beatin' against my bald spot. Paul is my mentor. People need that stuff to break the cabin fever of the winter at 8,500 feet. Okay, are we ready? (PEOPLE CHEERING) It's a huge, giant rush of adrenaline throughout your body, and you just feel wonderful. PATTY: Everything you think you can do in an airplane, everything you could even dream up, is what I like to do in my airplane. To be a good and safe aerobatic pilot, you have to have 100% concentrative focus. And that's one of the reasons that I really like what I do, is because it forces me to get rid of all the other sort of extraneous thoughts and all the mundane stuff that happens around you during the course of your life. And get inside this tunnel and think of nothing else but flying the airplane. My name is Patty Wagstaff, I'm an aerobatic pilot, and I'm in Saint Augustine, Florida. The airplane that I won the Nationals in for the first time is in the National Air and Space Museum, and it's sitting just behind one of my all-time heroes, Amelia Earhart. I mean, how cool is that? I mean, what a great honor. Being a three-time US National Aerobatic Champion, I'm very proud of that, because it's very difficult to do. I'm the first woman to win the Nationals, and the only woman to have won it more than once. I think you really have to be a little bit better than the guys to prove yourself and I like that. ♪ She's a child of the wild blue yonder ♪ She's a child of the wild blue yonder ♪ Born in an angel's tear ♪ PATTY: I always felt like I was a leaf, kind of floating in the wind. When I started flying even though it's the most freedom you can ever have, it's also the most limiting, in some ways, because you have to take it so seriously. Anything less than that can result in disaster or death. It really gives you a rush. CLIMBER: There's something about the moment that you lose touch with the earth. You know, the moment that your feet lift off the ground. There's this just instant feeling of joy and surprise. AMELIA: That feeling of vertigo, it's not the fear of falling. It's the fear of your deep desire to want to throw yourself into the freedom of the feeling of falling. I don't like standing on a cliff if I'm not anchored in. Soon as I'm anchored in and I understand the system, I'm free. When you take gravity and you just play with it, and you find ways to soften it, to dance on walls, to dance on cliff bases... When you're dancing on a cliff and a Peregrine falcon flies by and eyes you you're transported into a place where you no longer feel the ache of your harness, and you become the jump that you're doing. So often a critic will say, you know, "Is it dance?" Or a climber will say, "Oh, poo-poo. "They're wearing their tutus climbing El Cap." It's like a little bit of grit in the system. It makes you wonder. So things that are liminal, that are between things, have a lot of power. DAN: I get inspired by the age of the metal, the antique stuff. It gives me a lot of creative energy. It blows my mind that this metal made America what it is today. My name is Dan Klennert. I'm a Northwest sculptor. We're standing in my studio, three miles past Elbe, Washington, on the road to paradise and Mount Rainier. One piece sparks my imagination, then I go out and, like, fall in love with several other pieces of metal to combine it with that one to come up with a sculpture. To me, it isn't junk. It's rusty gold. The body's made out of Model T Ford oil and transmission covers. I like using rebar for the bird legs, because it's got the texture and the lines like birds have on their legs. The angled iron I'm gonna use is gonna represent the neck. And then you put the head on here, and you got yourself a bird that comes alive. To me, it moves. (CLANKING) I'm a 50-year-old kid at heart. Here we go. Here's a Ditch Witch digging tooth. A stove leg and that thing you put it on there and you've got an elephant. See the elephant? Here's an old bathtub leg. A claw-foot bathtub leg and that stove part... You stick 'em together, you got a camel. See his mouth? DAN: I really, truly believe that art should be put into schools. And it should be a major subject because, even though people were calling me a dummy, I was a special-ed kid, I found love and self-respect and everything else in art, and it made me feel good. I got saved. It saved me. A Native American said that if you work with your hands, you're a laborer. If you work with your hands and your mind, you're a craftsperson. If you work with your hands, mind, heart and soul, you're an artist. (LOONS CALLING) CHARLES: My father is an eagle. My mother is a raven. My father is respected very, very much in the clan. And that is why an eagle's so dear to me. When we rescue an endangered eagle and nurture him back to health, seeing him fly once again... And get the second chance... It's like watching our great spirit of freedom take flight. When they leave us, they go with our spirit. And they take it with them hopefully to our ancestors above. (CLARINET PLAYING) DAVID: We're at the Eldridge Street Synagogue, which is the oldest synagogue in America. It has a great feeling. When I'm here, I feel like I'm back, playing for my ancestors again. My name's David Krakauer, and I play klezmer music. Between 1880 and 1920, there was a huge migration of Eastern European Jews to America. It's really a miracle that klezmer music actually survived the holocaust because of the recordings made in New York City. (BAND PLAYING) Tradition always has to be living, it always has to be ongoing. So, the way I play klezmer music also freely blends a lot of the traditions that I've grown up listening to. Great jazz players, Sidney Bechet, Louis Armstrong. James Brown and Jimi Hendrix are big influences, too. When I'm playing music and I'm really, really into it, it's very cathartic. It's kind of like having primal-scream therapy, like, every single day. (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) MAN 1: All the dreams and all the prayers are before the light. The sun is rising. When it hits you, then turn and do the dream. Make it real. MAN: I came from Europe when I was 17 to follow my dreams. You know, people always dream of coming to America and then seeing what it's really like with their own eyes. It's always been a great dream of mine. Every kid's dream in Little League is to play the major leagues. They're searching for that one perfect swing where it comes off the bat, and you never feel it. When I saw the Met for the first time, it was just the ultimate thing of beauty for me, to look at it and go, "Oh, my God. That's my dream. I want to sing there." (PEOPLE APPLAUDING) 1ST BROTHER: We came to United States to have a better life, to work hard, so we can have what we always been dreaming since we was little, you know? To have our own house, our own family... (PRAYING IN SPANISH) Amen. We grew up without my father. And so, my mother she was the inspiration. You know what I remember? "Come on, guys, learn this." And she would stop cooking so she'd show us a step or something. And she would, you know, she's kind of little, fat... Chubby. Chubby. Chubby. She really tell us how to be real brothers. How to help each other, you know? To feel that you have a family, you know? We have that. (SALSA MUSIC PLAYING) He's the oldest. I'm the oldest. You can see his face, you know? He looks very tired now. No, no. I'm the oldest. I'm 30 years old, and I've been dancing for eight years. 1ST BROTHER: He's the one who introduced us into the salsa world. When I came here and I saw them dance, I was like, "Wow. I want to dance like that." You know? Now he's our inspiration. 2ND BROTHER: Inspiration. Yeah. He's been winning so many competitions and everything, so now we see my brother dancing and are like, "Oh, damn." Now we want to look like him, you know? 1ST BROTHER: Salsa, for me, it's like love, passion, sensual. The salsa used to be more traditional and more slow. We changed the salsa, put in tricks, make it a little bit more fun. All the ideas that I get, I get it from some people like Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire... I think that everybody has passion. You know, it's something that everybody has inside. And when you find out that feeling inside of you, you will never stop. MICHAEL: It was the hardest thing in the world to hear my mother weeping in the background as the judge passed sentence upon me. I was lying to my mother, stating that I wasn't hanging with this guy I met in high school. And on one fateful night, I decided to commit armed robbery, which cost me six years of my life. While I was incarcerated, I continued to get my education. And I learned how to box. Lot of guys have been fighting since they been little boys, while I had only been competing for a couple years. I was able to make up for my lack of experience, ring experience, from my heart, 'cause my heart carried me a whole lot of the distance. Come on. Work a little bit harder than that. MICHAEL: I decided to say, "Know what else?" I didn't want to be a old man on my rocking chair saying, "What if?" So I came out here with my goals in mind... and aimed for the Olympics, which I was able to obtain in a little under two years. My name is Michael Bennett, I'm a US Olympic athlete. I represented us as captain of the US Olympic boxing team. I set that goal for myself, and I grabbed it and I put it in my pocket. I brought it home to my mother to show her, like, "Look at the good job I did." GEORGE: My name is George Hernandez. I'm the boxing instructor here at Garfield Park working, training with kids, and teaching them how to box. My job is very hard. I have to compete with drugs, the streets, the gangbangers... GEORGE: Looking real good. That's it. You can? You want to try it? I think I got about eight or nine kids on my wall already that are dead. These kids are not gonna box anymore. It's over. That, to me, is the hardest thing to do. When you go up to these kids and you see them for that last time when they're laid out in that casket, and they're cold. They're cold. That's the hardest thing. Yeah. That's the hardest thing. MICHAEL: A host of other men that I met along my path took time out to invest in me. I'm trying to give back. You know, trying not to allow the streets to swallow him up. Because as long as he stays in here, he's safe. He treated me like I was special. He'd run and play with me. He like a father to me. Seeing as you are the boxer... MICHAEL: Right now, you're looking at the future. And truly, if God blesses me, to bless him, you'll see him somewhere along these lines as being a champion as well. And hopefully, in some Olympics, maybe eight years from now. (BOTH LAUGHING) ERIK: I think all the things that you need to survive and do well on a mountain also help you do well in life. I've been learning how to use ingenuity. To use innovation to kind of reach beyond the obvious and find these secret systems that enable me to do things that I might not have thought I could do. My name is Erik Weihenmayer. I love to climb mountains, ice climb, rock climb... For the last few years, I've been trying to climb what is called "the seven summits." The highest peak in each of the seven continents. That's pretty wild, I guess, for a blind person. I mean, being a blind mountain climber is sort of like being a Jamaican bobsledder. (BABY CRYING) When I went blind, there was a time that I thought that life was filled with a lot of loss and not a lot of gain. Sometimes things are taken away and sometimes things are given to you. And you have to appreciate the things that you have. Erik is what I would refer to as a pioneer of the impossible. Erik's already got a large part of the seven summits under his belt. He's got Denali, Aconcagua, Kilimanjaro, and Vinson already climbed. Now this is my kind of ice. Keep on truckin', man. You look great. ERIK: When I'm reachin' out and swinging my ice tool, you know, I'm pretty sure it's a good hit, but you're never really 100% sure. Oops, watch out. There you go. ERIK: The beauty of climbing is the idea that you're putting your life in someone's hands, and they're putting your life in my hands. That's a good feeling to know people trust you that much. Some people collect, you know, like, antiques or baseball cards. For me, I just like to sort of collect experiences. Whatever it is, just trying to soak it up. Get as much out of that as I can. Please. We discovered a new grade. That's, like, grade nine. Is that grade nine? Okay. 'Cause you have to grade it, like, two grades higher when you close your eyes. (LAUGHING) There you go. ERIK: For me, all the great things that have ever come to me have come through reaching out. And I think life is sort of an ongoing process of reaching out into the darkness when you really don't know what you're gonna find. MAN: Now we're off to climb Mount Everest, probably the most difficult and the highest mountain in the world at 29,000 feet. And this is gonna prove to be the most difficult one that he undertakes. He breaks all the molds and perceptions that people have about blind people and challenged people today. He's a great example of true inspiration. We did it, buddy. We did it! We did it. Proved everybody else. Good work. Good job. We did it, man. Whoo! We're on top of the world. We are on top of the world. Yes, it hurts. It hurts to feel like you're not doing what you could do. Or to feel like the world is crushing on you. Or to feel like you're nobody. Or to feel like everything is going against you. Many of you come to Glide because you feel some human connection. Many of you come to Glide because you are looking to be reunited. Many of you come to Glide because you want some spirit. You want to be lifted up. You want to cry. You want to moan. You want to shout. You want to raise your hands. You want to clap your hands. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) That's why we come together. CECIL: When I first came here 38 years ago, I decided that I wanted a church that was inclusive. So the first thing I did is went out in the Tenderloin area here, and began to relate to the people that were on the fringes of society. People that felt that they had no voice. And secondly, this church had a celebration where we had gospel, contemporary music, freedom songs... ♪ Stand up and ALL: ♪ Praise him ♪ If you know he's in the room ♪ You've got to ♪ Praise him ♪ Yeah ♪ Come on and join me ♪ Praise him ♪ If you know that he died for you ♪ Hey, we're talking to you ♪ CECIL: We were not even concerned about ideologies for a while.

And what a worker. We try to make sure that nobody overshadows the other. JANICE: When I met Cecil, he was this crazy, radical, on-the-edge guy. This was in 1965. And he was out in the streets, bringing in the people who were lying down drunk, totally strung out... He was daring the church to come down off of its piety and say, "Here is a feasting table. Sit. Come. You are all welcome." We started a meal program here, just from a corps of volunteers. A program that feeds a million and a half meals a year. I like the food, especially the chicken on Thursday. I'm on a pension myself, 'cause I'm a retiree. And towards the end of the month, you know, like, it really helps out. CECIL: Whatever they're into, when they come to Glide, we accept them as they are, and hope that they will be able to do something with their lives. The power is in their hands. It's in their voice. That's your first step. You've got to want to be helped. You've got to want to help yourself. If you don't want to help yourself, it's a continuous cycle out here. It's a good job. And it's keeping me from being in the line, 'cause I've been on that side. I had a slight gap in my employment history between 1968 and 1995. ♪ I feel better ♪ So much better ♪ Since I laid my burdens down ♪ CECIL: We have been called, as the church, to lead the nation. To bring justice. We should stop tryin' to get folks to go to heaven or hell and get folks to live with each other here on the earth, right now. CECIL: I want to see your eyes opening up with not the shades or shadows covering them but love, beaming with light from your eyes, which tells me it's coming from your soul. I want that... heart and soul. I want heart and soul. ♪ Have a little faith in me ♪ And have a little faith in me ♪ And have a little faith in me ♪ And have a little faith in me ♪ COMPUTERIZED VOICE: I am 36 years old, and I have cerebral palsy. As you can see, I use my computer to speak for me. When I was born, the doctors told my parents to put me in an institution. I am lucky that my parents did not do that, or I might not have been able to be here today. DICK: This special bond developed between Rick and I when Rick was first born, and we started doing everything together. And I think the bond just got stronger and stronger as Rick grew and got older. (PEOPLE CHEERING) Boston is the only marathon in the world where you have to run a certain time depending on your age. They were using Rick's age for us to qualify. So that meant we had to run under two hours and 50 minutes. It was Rick that got us into running, and I wouldn't be running today if Rick didn't ask me to. (GUN FIRES) RICK: The Boston Marathon is the one event that I look forward to all year long. It is definitely my favorite race. RICK: The people along the way are the best. They have such enthusiasm that when my dad and I run by, the adrenaline rush is unbelievable. ANNOUNCER: Dick Hoyt, pushing son Rick. Dick and Ricky Hoyt at the finish line yet again. DICK: Rick and I compete as a team. I have no desire to go out and run on my own. I don't feel there is anything that Rick and I can't accomplish together. Both Rick and Dick are such an inspiration to this city. Competing in their 18th marathon, together they have proven that anything is possible and achievable, as long as you set your mind to it. DICK: Rick is the athlete, and I'm just out there loaning him my arms and my legs, so that he's able to compete like everybody else. I am the body, Rick is the heart, and mobility is freedom.
