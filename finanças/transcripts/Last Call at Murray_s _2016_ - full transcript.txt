Yo, Murray! You got small ones. Eh! Not the first time I've heard that. Hey, that beer ain't free. How about offering twofers in celebration of the last night? Like hell. I'm doubling the price.

He finally signed! All I have to do is autograph these, and I am officially a divorcée. Whoa! Shots all around! Everything but the... Jameson. The weather report did not say anything about snow. Hey! Don't get Jack drunk. He's driving the first leg. May Roxie finally find a decent job. And maybe find a decent man too, huh? ♪ Damn, that is good! Right now, all I need is a guy who can keep my pipes from freezing. How about you, Jack? You wanna warm my pipes? So, what are you waitin' for? Why don't you sign these bad boys right now? Right now.

Never having to work in this shithole again is severance package enough for me. Keep dissing my bar and I'll leave it to you in my will. Out of my way. - That would be cruel and unusual, Murr.

You know, I'd like to take her home with me. Or do you wanna keep everything that's mine? Bennett, look... So, still snowing outside, huh? Like a metaphor. Better not be snowin'.

Not anymore. You got little ones. Is it that obvious? Folks around here call me Hutch. - DR. - DR? What's that stand for? Death Rack. I earned it in a pool hall. - Uh-oh. Is that your lovely lady?

Lis is growing up thinking this is how men act. You gotta fix that, Roxie. Have a nice guy over for a change. And, said ho is married. And I'm guessing her husband doesn't approve of her extra-curriculars. Imagine that. But look at the bright side. Maybe he'll shoot Craig right out of your life.

She knows it's what Mama wanted. She's just looking for one more crime to pin on me. But I did the right thing. I know I did. Didn't I? I know I did. Why did God do that?

I knew you'd be mad. Mad?! Ya think?! Danice, don't leave me! All right, everyone just relax. Most first labors take like 8 to 10 hours. We got plenty of time. You know, you really are a cold lady, shutting your sister out when she's this vulnerable? Her hiding it clearly shows that she is not ready for the responsibility of her first child. It's not her first. It's her third. And the last one came in 45 minutes. You deceitful slut! - Shut up! - Okay, okay, okay. Roxy! 911. It's worth a shot. I'm on it. Hey, hey! Come here, come here.

I want you guys to know, just... It really... - Hey! Nobody gives a shit. Evidently, the Pope thinks I shouldn't either. No, it's just... It's just what Autumn said. You know? It's not like I'm, whatever- like I'm some closet case. Or in denial. Right? I'm proud of being a Marine. And I'm proud to be gay! All right? If anyone's got a problem with that... Hey, hey, hey. I'm proud of you too. But check this place out. All right? You know who comes in here? Bikers. Rednecks. People who basically would make politicians look morally virtuous. So, in the morning... the plows are gonna clear off the roads... and you're gonna be free. Outta here. So like I said... Who gives a shit? - Danice? - Yes, baby? I'm sorry I said you killed Mama. It's okay. I knew she didn't want to be hooked up to no machines, but I was just pissed... 'cause you was always her favorite. No. She didn't. Are you kidding me? She liked you the best. - Nuh-uh. - Yuh-huh. You were her baby. You were her favorite from the moment she pushed your way into this world. Really? Really, really. Okay. They're comin' faster now. Danice... You know I'm not made to stay home with no babies, right? Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You gonna help me with this one too. Right? Right? - Shh, shh. Shh, shh, hey. Why don't we just worry about having this one first? Okay? Now it's time to start working. What the fuck you think I've been doin'? Okay, next contraction, I need you to push. Roxy, try the ambulance again, okay? And bring me a bucket for the placenta. We have to save it for the paramedics. Okay? And push! Push! There you go. Good girl. Good, good, good. Reminds me of my second. We almost didn't make it. And I thought we would deliver him by the side of the road. Marco, are you there? Pick up. I'm sitting here wondering where I fucked up. Was it the time we crossed swords, peeing in the backyard? I shouldn't have called your wife. And I shouldn't fire you on Monday. Breathe. But I guess we all do what we gotta do, huh? Is it because I always call you my bitch? Is it that time that I dressed you up like a little girl? Wait, that would fucking make me gay. Dude. Whatever. Just call me back, dude. Okay? I can fucking talk you out of it. You don't wanna watch the joy of birth? Yeah. Right after I shave my head with a cheese grater. Too many fucked-up people in this world to bring another one in, right? Yeah. I know someone who's already brought in two kids too many. What you did with the phone was brave. Brave? Guy couldn't make up his mind. You did it for him. Push! There you go. Good girl! Good girl! And breathe. Can I ask you a favor? It'll cost you. It's risky. I'm gonna need hazardous duty pay. There's a sturdy counter in the bathroom. Copy that. Shh, shh. Okay, only a few more. Only a few more. You're almost there. Come on, push. Good, good, good, good. Okay, and breathe. And breathe, and breathe. It's a secret recipe, man. It's been passing down through generations through generations. So what generation are you? Third generation chili maker? Fourth! And it's not just the chili. - No? - No. I'm death on ribs, barbecue, omelets, all of it. I should have known you were gay. I enjoyed the show. I bet you don't see naked women too often. You'd be surprised. - Really? - Sure. Insecure women, afraid of rejection, trying to re-affirm their sexuality by seducing the unobtainable. Women trying to work through their child abuses and approaching a father figure. What a head-hump. So, women with latent homosexuality issues operating through the parameter of what they perceive to be a safe man? Oh yeah. We get that crap all the time. Is that my car? What did you do to my car? Strangest fucking thing, I tell you. I went out to my truck to get a condom... and I saw an icicle break off the roof... and crash through a really nice car's windshield... and... knock the shifter into neutral... bounce off the dash board... and unleash the parking brake. What?! And now it's rolling towards a cliff. Precious! Yep. Strangest fucking thing, I tell you. I've been waitin' for this. Get in there! Here comes the head! Jeez, I think that's the head. That's the head. One more push, honey. Okay, jeez, all right. - Give me some light. - Got this. Hold on. There you go. There you go. There you go. Good. Good, good, good. Aw! Okay, give me the wrap. There we go. Where is she? She's in the bathroom. With Skip. The few... the proud... Whoa-ho. You fuckin' rock. Yeah. Stop talking. Well? What is it? It's a baby. Ten fingers, ten toes. Come on, Hutch. Don't tease us. It's a girl. My first girl! Aw! I'm gonna name her after Mama. Oh, honey. Hutch, all this time, I never knew you were a nurse. All this time, I never asked you what it is that you fixed. I was always talking about... my own problems, huh? Sorry. That's it. Starting tomorrow... no more talk about... he-who-shall-not-be-named. Roxy. Starting tomorrow, I won't... I mean... The bar won't even be around. You won't be able to see me anymore. Unless you ask me out on a proper date. Think you can handle that? Roxanne... will you go... May we have a moment of silence, please? Balls fucking deep. Stop talking, please. Heavenly Father... we thank you for this... glorious blessing. What the fuck? - Amen. - Amen. Oh, yes. Roxy... Would you... Would you... I haven't done this in a long time. Take your time. Roxanne... would you go out on a proper date with me? I'd love to. Ain't this romantic? ♪ Roxanne? I took a look at your divorce papers. I left them right there behind the bar. Please tell me everything's okay. Everything's cool. Feel free to sign at will. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll be right back. Thanks. Brains and beauty. And you're nice to waitresses too. - Are you flirting with me? - Is it working? Is it over with your girlfriend? Way over. Then it's working. ♪ You know, before tonight, I probably would have crossed the street to keep from walking past someone that looked like you. Probably would have maced you just to be on the safe side. You know, you wouldn't be the first. Really? Aw. I would've missed meeting someone worth knowing. What about you? What about me? Well, I'd bet that you are professional, responsible. - Oh, that I am. - Yeah. Always watching out for everyone. Always taking care of everyone's needs. There's a question I have for you. All right, Miss Beauty-With-Brains? Who's, um... Who's watchin' out for you? - Seriously?! - Fucking A! I called the ambulance. They said they'd be here in an hour. Good. That baby needs to get looked at. There's always risk of infection. Don't forget Jack. My apologies. How could he forget Jack? Well, well done, Nurse Hatch. - Indeed. - Nurse Hutch. And his lovely assistant. Ah. Lovely partner. Another round? - Uh-huh. Why not? Now, that's the saddest thing I've ever seen. There's another one back there. Okay. Where is Murray, anyway? I think he's hiding out in the storeroom. I have never shown this to anyone. ♪ It's my bucket list. See? 20 things I want to do before I end up in the old folk's home. I made that list, like, ten years ago. In that time, I've managed to do one. Which one? Get a manicure. And not these nails. It was like four years ago. I know, I know. Oh, it's pathetic, huh? Well, let's look at this, okay? Number one, Grand Canyon. Mm-hmm. - Sushi? - Maybe the cooked kind. Sing in public. Swim with the dolphins. Wait, wait. Here on number 20. What's this word after "multiple"? You know what? You're teasing me. You know... a guy like me could get you everything on this list. I have... houseplants. Let 'em die. My sister? Needs to grow up and take care of her own kids. Or give them to somebody else who can. Oh, you make it sound so simple. It can be. But there's one condition. And what's that? This list. It can only be done on the back of a motorcycle. I'm supposed to do number 20 from the back of a motorcycle? Just riding the motorcycle is gonna give you number 20. Oh, my God. What's with you two anyway? Murray and I, we had a friendship that goes back to the third grade. I mean, we were... the odd couple even then. I was studious. He was always the life of the party. He dated a lot... and I was more discerning. Yeah, I could see him as a serious chick magnet. That was succinctly put. And then it happened. Right here in this bar. I met her. She was the girl of my dreams. She was beautiful. It was wonderful. But... she succumbed to Murray's charms, and... I had to leave. I haven't been back since then. Actually... until tonight. How long were you two together? Four glorious days. ♪ Okay. - Yeah? - I'm in. But I have one condition for you. Okay. You have to tell me what the DR really stands for. I'm not getting on the back of a bike with you and not know your name. - Okay. - Okay? Oh, my God. Wooh, sign me up. You had a hot weekend... and when she moved on, you've been, like, nursing this grudge against your bestie all this time? When you say it like that, it sounds ridiculous. I could rephrase it if you like, but I think it'll just sound the same. She... didn't move on. She was seduced. We've all been seduced at some point. Murr? Murray? Where are ya? Oh, lord. What? So we're the only ones who got any. Don't be fucking hatin'. I'm gonna pour myself a glass of wine. Skip? Ooh! - Fucking brew. She can still walk? But first, time to respect the urethra. Semper Fi, piss or die! Hoo-ah. Oh, man. What? I think I left the bucket of placenta in the men's room. Oh! I should probably tell him. No, no, no, no, no! You're right. You're right. Don't tell him.

He was a Catholic when he was a kid! Maybe that'll help. He must have passed about the same time the baby was born. You... You can't do this to me! Bennett. God damnit. Fuck you, Murray! Fuck you! I didn't expect you to die. I thought that we could make up. You know? He wasn't supposed to die. He was just... Jesus Christ. I'm gonna miss you, you motherfucker! I'm gonna miss you, god damnit!
