(wine pouring) (glass clinks) (light piano music) (chiming) - [Man] Like so many others, I used to say I wanted proof. Proof of miracles, proof of god. So we might believe in existence beyond our own. It was all we ever wanted, only proof. And then we had it. (somber orchestral music) (vehicles zooming) - The image with nothing enhanced or adjusted in any way. It first appeared on August 15th, 2024 and has been studied by top scientists from over 11 countries. It is currently being regarded as an unexplainable phenomenon. At approximately 6:15 we experienced a global unconsciousness. The incident has caused widespread panic across the globe while there has still been no official statement on what may have caused the event. So far we know the boy has successfully predicted two of the three events he stated would change the world as we know it. The first was at the planes of Garabandal, Spain, early 2024. The first sign, as some are calling it, can be photographed and televised, but not touched and is clearly something not of this world. (zapping) - Really? It's come to this? I got to stalk you for my money? Would you shut that thing off? Hey, I know a lot's changed after what happened. But some things don't. You still have to pay your rent. - Things have been slow. I got a job coming up. - Yeah. That's what you said last week. Look, Erik, I like you, a lot more than my other tenants. But those others, they pay their rent. - I just need a little more time. - You're out of time. Either find the money by tomorrow or find another place to live. I'm sorry. You were really great, you know that? (door shutting) - [Shop Owner] We just got a new selection. After what happened, we've been selling out like crazy. - That's the one. - Beretta 92. Fine choice for home protection. - Who said it's for protection? - I'm not doing this anymore. I told you already you ain't getting it, now put it back. - Our secret. (somber music) (knocking) - My apologies for the early our. I assume you were asleep. - It's five a.m., why would I be asleep? - I'm Dr. Anthony Faron. I run a research team out of Parkland. - Okay. You wanna tell me what this is about? - I was wondering if I might come in. It's regarding your son. Since the warning, the world's been in this state of chaos, of paranoia. - The warning? - That's what your son called the blackout. - The world was falling apart long before that. - We're running out of time so I'll be as forthcoming as possible. It was the second of three events he predicted. He is yet to reveal the third. Truth is, I came here to take you with me. - Not sure I follow. - We need somebody he trusts. - You think I'm that guy. - He knows something. Something he doesn't want anyone else to know. Said he'd only talk to you. - So I'm the last option. And I'd wanna help you because-- - I know the social services has deemed you an unfit father. This is your opportunity to amend that. Get a fresh start. If it's anything like the last event, this could be a matter of national security. - Look, I wish I could help, it's just bad timing. I haven't spoken to him in years. He's gotta be 13-- - 14. And no one's expecting you to be father of the year. One day, that's all we're asking. We would of course compensate you generously for your time. - Where are you taking me? - [Anthony] Black Satan. Location's off the grid. He was transferred there this morning. - Transferred where? - Where he's expected to receive the next message. Let's go. (somber music) If you don't mind my asking, what did you see during the warning? - I don't remember. - Have you had nightmares since it happened? - Nightmares? - Residual effects of the event. It's not uncommon. - I'm still not totally clear on what we're doing out here. - And I wish I had time for a proper tour but the issue is pressing. I'm sure you understand. It says here that you haven't had contact with the boy since he was four. - Right, I've been, - Out of the picture. And in reality, he wouldn't be here if I had a say in it. I don't. As I mentioned, he said he would only talk to you. That puts us both in a position we'd rather not be in. - And what is it you want exactly? - Just answers. What he thinks is coming and when. Soon as he gets the message I wanna know everything. There are details he keeps from us. The details matter. - Where is he now? - [Anthony] He passed every polygraph we have. - You keep him in here all day? - It's for his own protection. - Yeah, I'll bet. No TV, no windows or sunlight? I'm sure he loves it. All that's missing are the padded walls. - The appearance is expected at 0600, that leaves 19 hours. He is the only one who knows the precise location it'll occur. You have 15 minutes. Get him talking. - Hi. It's been a long time. Mind if I sit down? So I don't really know what I'm doing here. They said you sent for me. - They're listening. - Maybe I should do the talking. - Not here. - [Erik] I noticed the burns on your arm, what happened? - There were tests. Our science can't explain this. - You think there's some sort of message here? - No, that's just what I told them. - Then why'd you ask me to come? - There's somewhere I need you to take me. But they won't allow me to leave. - Take you where? - If I receive my final message, - I don't understand. - You will. It's six days when the message was revealed to me. You still dream of her? - Of who? - Of mom? You saw her in the woods calling to you. It's where we need to go. You did see her, didn't you? (tense music) Protect him. Isn't that what she said? - How could we have had the same dream? - 'Cause it's not a dream. It just hasn't happened yet. Time isn't relative. So mom sees everything now. - Your mom died. She's not with us anymore. - You're wrong. During the blackout you got a glimpse of your future. Mine depends on you. So will you help me or not? - I need more time. - What for? - You want answers or not? Then give me another night. Tomorrow morning I'll be here first thing, I'll get you the answers you need. And one more thing. I'm gonna need that compensation in cash. (tense music) You all know what they're filling his head is? You've seen where they keep him? - [Woman] It took you how many years to start caring? - I'm breaking him out of that place. I'll bring him to you. There's somewhere I need you to take him. - What's going on, Erik? - I don't know. I'll call when I can. (tense music) (zooming) What are they giving him? - Just a mild sedative. Helps him relax. You're about to get a front row seat to history in the making. Try not to look so excited. - So how are you gonna get us out of this? What's your plan? - How should I know? You're the one who sees the future, right? - That's not how it works. I don't choose what I'm shown. - Relax, kid. Just watch for my signal and run like hell. - That's your plan? - It's approximately six a.m. So far, what the boy has seen defies explanation. There are questions that remain unanswered until now. We're confident that whatever happens here today will be nothing short of miraculous. This is Dr. Anthony Faron reporting from site B. Stand by. (tense music) (dog barking) - Remind me what the hell we're doing out here. - You didn't hear? This kid's the voice of god. - The guy better speak up. I missed a hunting trip for this. - What's happening? - Isn't it obvious? Nothing. Something's wrong. (gun firing) (dog barking) - Hold your fire, you'll hit the boy! (dog barking) Kill the feed. (growling) - What is it? - My car, I left it right here. (dog barking) Out of the car! Now! Get in. - Hands in the air! Hands in the air now! - On your knees! On your knees! - How does a multimillion dollar agency with security clearance to the Pentagon lose my nephew? - Miss Parker, please cooperate with us. He was last seen with your brother. We're worried about his safety. - Erik would never hurt him. - Not Caleb's safety, Erik's. It's possible that Caleb's not only predicting these events, he may be causing them as well. If that's the case, he could be a danger to anyone he comes in contact with. Now, has he been here or tried to contact you? - Look, I told you. I haven't seen my brother or my nephew, not since your crack team took him eight months ago. - And you have no idea where he's headed? - I don't know. But if he doesn't want you to find him, you won't. - We'll find him. Gifted or not, he's still just a boy. - We both know that's not true. (urgent music) - Officials have declared the boy an enemy of the state. The Vatican has neither approved or denied his predictions which some are calling miraculous, proof of God while still others believe the incidents to be government related. Regardless of their origin, there's no denying the boy's prophecies have affected the country. (somber music) - Yeah it's all right, we'll figure this thing out. - You know, you're not that bad. I don't care what everyone else says. - Oh, what does everyone else say? - You're selfish, egocentric, narcissistic, douchebag. - Okay, I get it, thanks. - I'm glad you agreed to help me. If we leave tonight we'll make it there in time. - Oh, slow down. We're not going anywhere, I have a job here. - Then why'd you come get me? - [Erik] I'm gonna call your aunt, set up some place to meet and she'll know what to do. - So that's it? You're just gonna pass me off after one day? - Look kid, I'm not your legal guardian, all right? Now you wanted out of that place, I got you out. The deal's square. - We have to keep moving. They won't stop until they find me. - Listen, whatever it is these people want from you, Kathryn'll keep you safe. Much better than I can. - [Caleb] I never asked you for anything. (slamming) (sighing) (tense music) - [Kathryn] Hello? - It's me. - Eric. You know you have the Feds beating down my door. Where are you? - Not far. I was hoping we could meet up and maybe there's a way I-- - You could what? Dump your kid off again? While you were drinking yourself to death I was raising your son. I'm not getting involved in all of this. I'm sorry. - Kathryn? Kathryn! (honking) Get in the car. (car starting) - We need to talk. - Officer Scott. Why are you here and not out looking for the boy like I paid you to be? Do I need to remind you that if you don't find him, someone else will. - I'll find him. I just wanna know what it is I'm getting involved in. What exactly did you do here? - I led a team, part of the Commission of Inquiry. We launched a rigorous investigation into the validity of the boy's apparitions. We were studying him and the authenticity of the messages. - What were your findings? - Nobody had the slightest doubt about the boy's sincerity or the nature of the encounters, that they were supernatural in origin. - Supernatural? - The whole world loses consciousness for three minutes. Things happen that we can't explain, see how our lives affect one another. Planes fall from the sky and nobody saw it coming but the boy. Come to find out he was trying to warn us but we weren't listening. - You're listening now. - Yes we are. - I wanna see the results. - Everything we have on Caleb Black. Understand most science was once considered a miracle. If we can figure out these so-called miracles we can control them. - Why'd you come to me? You already have half the FBI on this. - I needed somebody who could cut through the red tape. Do things the Commission can't. - What about the boy's father? - He's nobody. Won't be a problem. Whoever controls the boy controls the future. Bring him back to us. It's in his best interest and yours. (cars zooming in distance) (airy music) - Told you not to go out, it's not safe. Where were you? - Vending machine. - Breakfast of champions. - Authorities are offering a reward for the missing child. Brown hair, brown eyes, 14 years old. Last seen traveling with this man, Erik Black. The suspect is believed to be armed and dangerous. If you have any information, - Get away from the window. Get some sleep. We're leaving first light. - You're gonna take me? - I'll take you where you wanna go to prove there's nothing out there. On one condition. You do what I say when I say it, you got it? (car starting) - The last car was a lot nicer. (droning music) (siren blaring in distance) - Get down. - We can't stay here. - Well there's not another motel for miles. We need to switch cars. - They'll know we're here. - You don't know that. - Mom would want you to trust me. - You don't know what your mom would want. (car starting) (zooming) (slightly tense music) - [Reporter] Local law enforcement are searching for a black 1967 Chevy Impala last seen at the Oasis Motel Tuesday morning. Authorities have offered a one million dollar bounty for the successful capture or information on the whereabouts of the boy. - Can we stop to eat? - We need to drive through, need to get off the main road. - Real food? Just this once? It's my birthday. - Wait here. (tense music) (light country rock music) - Two avocado burgers. - [Caleb] Wait. - What for? - Say grace. - Prayer was your mother's thing. Why don't you lead? - I thank you for this food and please help my father. - You don't like avocados? - If I eat them I'll die. - That part of your deal? Your kryptonite or something? - No. Like an allergy. You drink a lot. - Keen observation. - You trying to numb something? - What is this, an intervention? - An observation. Like you said. - Look, you called me, remember that. And what I do and how much I drink ain't your concern, got it? Last thing I need is a chaperone. - Sorry about the peach. Ran out of cake months ago. Some friends of yours? - I'm Erik, this is Caleb. - I know who you are. Everyone does. Your disguises are terrible. - I told you. - So Miss Maya. Got a back exit to this place? - Yeah. It's in the back. - Right. - You need a lift? I know some people who'd love to meet you. There's a shelter not far from here. - What are you offering? - Protection. And a shower. Look like you both could use it. Offer expires in about 30 seconds. (tense music) I know you broke him out of that facility. It's been all over the news. - They were treating him like some sort of lab rat. I didn't have a choice. They went back on their word. - The government lied to you? You don't say? - [Reporter] Successful capture or information on the whereabouts of the boy. - Can you turn this up? - [Reporter] Traffic's backed up on Interstate 90 with checkpoints along all major overpasses. Be on the lookout for a white male, early 30s last seen traveling north with the boy. - You two are popular. Looks like I'm with a celebrity. Don't worry, I know another way. - What are we doing? - Walking. I know the trails around here. I got a friend who has a cabin not far. I'll see if he can meet us there. (tense music) - Why are you doing all these for us? - I believe in him and what he stands for. - Hard to believe in much these days. - Where you boys headed? - North toward the mountains. - What's in the mountains? - No one knows but him. My guess is nothing. I just had to make sure he gets there in time. Once we get to this cabin of yours we can chart another course, be out of your business. - Not a problem at this end. Got eyes on the dad and his boy, traveling north into the woods. Some chick with them. - Don't call me here again until you have it. - Hey can I ask you a question? - No. - You asked me earlier why I'm helping you. Your son's important. He's giving humanity hope. This is bigger than us. - Yeah, a true believer. - You're not? - I believe in what I see. (branches cracking) - What was that? - I don't know, come on, let's keep moving. - There used to be a trail here. We have to be close. But before we go any further, no signal. - We're running out of daylight. (branches cracking) What is it? - I don't know, I thought I heard something. (gun firing) (intense music) (breathing heavily) (phone ringing) Thanks. There it is. Power's out. The breaker's in the basement. - I'll go. You two look for food. (light music) (thumping) (tense music) - [Erik] Hands in the air, now! - Easy man, take it easy. - Erik, no. Put the gun down. This is Tom, it's his cabin. - I came as soon as I got your message. Hell of a greeting. - He can take us where we need to go. - Thanks, but we travel alone. - Tom knows these back woods better than anyone I know. He can get you there in half the time. - Who the hell is this? - I told you to come alone. - Paul's good. He's the only one that knows, all right? It's fine. - What's this place, why is it marked? Well, stick to the outskirts, take a low profile. Avoid checkpoints until we get through the city. We come to the trails, stay close and watch out for any others. - Others? - Rogue militants, mercenaries. Call them what you want. Either way, they've probably been tracking you since you took him from that site. - They want him for the money? - They don't care about the money. They wanna silence him. See him as a threat to the world's order. Don't look so surprised. The kid says he talks to god. You don't think that's gonna light a few fires? Not everybody likes the message he's proclaiming. Your son started a holy war. - No, absolutely not! - What's going on? - Paul's a journalist from a local syndicate. - Easy. There are a lot of unanswered questions. The world will wanna know. - That's why you came. Exploit my kid for a paycheck. These are friends of yours? - We have a right to know what's coming and how we can stop it. - You can't stop it. No one can. - Caleb, grab your things, we're leaving. - It's okay. I'll tell him what he wants to know. It's part of why we're here. - You claim to know what's coming. That we caused it. Now if God allows free will, then how can he know our predetermined fate? - Just because he knows what we're ultimately going to choose doesn't mean he'll force us to choose it. - These visions you have, Caleb. Why don't others have them? - Not everyone can see. - And how do they come to you? - I see them in my dreams. Like a memory that just hasn't happened yet. - Not sure I understand. - You will. In four days. - What happens in four days? - Tears will flow if hearts don't change. Hatred brought us to this point, lack of love for one another. The warning was ignored and that's why so many will be lost when it happens. - When what happens, Caleb? - When the earth goes black. (crickets chirping) - I hope he didn't scare you in there. - [Maya] It's not that easy. - Look, I never got a chance to thank you for helping us. - Nah. Alcohol and I didn't mix. Going on three years dry. AA, the whole deal. - A bartender that doesn't drink. What's the secret? - Die to yourself. A little more everyday. Your wife? - She was. - It's okay, we don't have to talk about it. I just, I just figured if the others are right, if this really is the end of the world, I just might be the last person on the planet you can share your memories with. How does he handle it all? - You know, for a long time he wouldn't tell anyone about the things he'd see. He saw it as a curse. Then he said he had to. Thought it was part of his mission. I never wanted her to go through with the pregnancy. We were young and the kid was the last thing either of us needed. But Emily said she'd have him with or without me so I, I gave in. The night he was born, they couldn't stop the bleeding. If she would have known what it was gonna cost her she would have, she would have made another choice. - Would she? - Truth is I blamed him. She died and I blamed him. Maybe still do. Why do you think all this is happening? - I don't know. Maybe god just wants our attention. There was a time when seeing was believing. But your son's been called a prophet and you're telling me his own father is a skeptic. - Look, if there is a god, I don't trust him. I mean how can you trust someone who took away the only thing that mattered to you? - Do you ever think he allows the bad things in our lives to happen to course correct us to the good? - No. - Well he has his hands in this. All of it. I wanna show you something. - [Reporter] The image has not been enhanced or adjusted in any way. - Broadcast 24-7 for the past two years for the entire world to see. A beacon of hope for millions of people. And your son, he knew what was coming weeks in advance. He didn't choose any of this. He was chosen. How else could he know? That's my point. People see what they wanna see and they blind themselves to the rest even when the truth is right in front of them. Your son is the miracle the world needed but you can't even see that. (light music) - Good travels. Call me when you get there. - Will do. - Any breakfast? - No, I'm good. - I meant for me. - Year of the dog, my friend. - Someone's outside. (tense music) - Says we have a better chance if we don't run. - What if he's wrong? - He never is. - If they find him, they'll kill him. Follow me. - Go around and watch the back. If they run, shoot them. (men mumbling) Open it. Now. - Whatever happens, don't make a sound. (tense music) - Wonders never cease. - It's really him. - Of course it is. You think I'd drag you all the way out here if it wasn't? - The visionary that sees the future. Tell me the truth. You didn't see this coming, did you? You want that, it's gonna take some divine intervention. Go ahead. Mystify me. Make me a believer. - I wasn't asked to make you believe. Only to tell you that love is the only thing that will save us. - Wow. Ain't that beautiful? - It's me. Yeah, yeah, we have the boy. I have it under control. - So what happens now? - We wait. - All you gotta do is admit that you're lying and we'll let you go. Just tell the world the truth. - You don't have to be afraid. - What was that? - You're scared. I could see it in your eyes. It's for people like you that I bring my message. God's not too late for you. Life on earth is short. Everything will pass, as will you. - Shut him up! - Where there's death, there will be life. - Stop! Wait for Gabriel. (light music) - Wake up, Erik. (gasping) (groaning) - We need to get out of here. - How? - He's on his way. I'll call you when he gets there. (tense music) - Have to keep moving. - I can't. I'm fine. - [Anthony] You told us you were going to reveal three secrets. Two of them have already come to pass. What's the third secret, Caleb? - [Caleb] The message hasn't been revealed to me. - [Anthony] These messages, how do they come to you? - [Caleb] I hear a voice. It guides me. - [Anthony] You hear voices, they tell you what to do, give you signs of some sort. - [Caleb] There are always signs. We choose whether or not to follow them. But the time is coming. The hearts of men will be exposed. - Listen. I don't wanna argue, but if it wasn't supernatural, explain to me how you write off the blackout. - It's simple. Government infiltrates our lives through our computers and credit cards. No reason to think they haven't figured out a way into our minds. Satellite send signals through the airwaves, bang! Lights out. - Yeah, yeah, that makes much more sense. Are we lost? (chimes sounding) - What's wrong with him? What's he doing? - [Man] That's Ellie. She's my youngest daughter. You'll be staying safe here. - [Woman] John! - This way. - That's toward the city. - Walk by faith, right? - Yeah. Or fall for a Jedi mind trick. (droning music) - Hey! What are you doing in my yard? Oh, it's you. I'm sorry. I didn't realize. - We could use a place to stay. Just for the night. (door creaking) - Our house is your house as long as you need it. You'll be safe here. - That's what they told me about the last safe house. - [Man] That's Ellie. She's my youngest daughter. - Good looking family. - Are you the boy who talks to god? Is the end of the world really coming? - For some. - Your son, it's quite a gift he has. - Uh huh. - Would you like more wine? - Explain to me how a 15 year old manages to slip out of your grasp. - 14. The kid's 14 years old. - Shut up! - I won't lose him again. - I know. (tense music) (crayon scraping) - I saved all the news reports from the day it happened. Must have watched them at least a dozen times. Total blackout. We all experience a collective unconscious. How does everyone experience the exact same thing at the exact same time? Everyone's asking the same question now. If the world's about to end, am I happy with how I've been living my life? - What did you see when it happened? - A glimpse. It's hard to explain really. Like I saw it all from another perspective. Alone with my conscience I, I saw all my faults. How my life affected others. In those three minutes, we all saw who we really are. We all shared in the same universal experience. - And yet it divides us. - Not everyone liked what they saw. Just like with any difficult memory, if you wanna forget about it, you will. We all have free will. (sighing) Ignoring it doesn't make it less true. (somber music) - You making circles? Gotta get the molars clean. Right? There you go. There, good. Get every single one. (door creaking) - Did you brush your teeth? Okay well, get some sleep. - Do you think I'm a freak? - What? Why would you say that? - I'm different. - Different's good. The rest of us are just carbon copies of each other trying to fit in. You were born to stand out. Now go to sleep. - Dad? Do you ever think of her? Of Mom? - All the time. - What was she like? - You. She was a lot like you. Cared about everyone else more than herself. - I write her letters sometimes. Tell her what I'm feeling, tell her about my day. Is that stupid? - Does it help? - I think so. - Then it's not stupid. You have secrets. I'll let you in on one of mine. I could have done more. I'm a work in progress. - I think we all are. Good night. - Details about the boy have been vague at best. Is he a plant by the United States government to hide something bigger? Could we event trust him and his so-called apparitions? And where is he going? We have a right to know. As the search continues, Dr. Anthony Faron had this to say. (reporters chattering) - We're doing everything in our power to get the boy back. Rest assured, he will be recovered. He'll be returned as a government ward. - His safety, what about the boy's safety? - If he's watching, this is your last chance to turn the boy in. If you continue to run, you're putting your own life and the boy's at risk. I can no longer guarantee your safety. - [Reporter] Dr. Faron, what about the allegations that you plan to sell the boy back to the government? - Like you said, allegations. (reporters chattering) - Far as I can tell, the numbers are coordinates. Some sort of mapping system. Latitude and longitude leading here. - What about these? - I don't know, date and time maybe. - 11,27,27. Why this place? According to the map, there's nothing out there. - No, I'm in the dark like everyone else but we can't go back. - What do we do? - We have three days. Stick to the plan, keep heading north. - You really believe he's gonna receive the message when he gets there? - It doesn't matter what I believe anymore. (tense music) (intense music) - Fine. I will. I told you I would deliver the kid, didn't I? But we still have time. Don't worry about the father. I'll take care of him. If he doesn't, I'll do what I have to do. I'll take him tonight and be there by tomorrow morning, done deal. (tense music) - [Doll] It's playtime, Mommy! - I gotta go. - What's wrong? - [Erik] Explain on the road. Right now we just gotta get out of here. Trust me, grab your things. - You're a slow learner. I can't let you leave. - [Erik] What are you talking about? - I only want the boy. - Well you can't have him. - I don't wanna hurt you. But I will if I have to. (tense music) It's not personal. It's just a lot of money. You should be thanking me for saving his life. See you would never survive on your own. You can't protect him anymore. - Let him go. Drop the gun. - [Erik] You have rope? - It's in the garage. - [Erik] Take Caleb. - You've never killed a man before, have you? - You're right. But I've had a lot of firsts recently. (ominous music) - Where are you going? - Looks like we missed the party. There was nothing at the cabin. A tip came in from the journalist. He says he interviewed the kid. Has the tape if we're willing to pay for it. - Give me the number. - Caleb, time to go. You ready? Look, I know he scared you but I'm not leaving, trust me on that. Caleb? What happened? Caleb! - [Man] Make yourself at home. - Here. It was my mom's but, I'm too old for it now. You have it so you'll remember me. - We're in the middle of nowhere. - That's the idea. - You can't leave me here. You're the target of a nationwide manhunt. They're gonna find you. Then you're gonna wish I took your kid. And someone is gonna fin-- - It's not personal. - Hey! Hey! Hey! (electronic music) - [Erik] Not a day goes by I don't think of you. You left a part of you. I see you in him. In ways I couldn't before. And for that, I'm grateful. (coins clanking) (toilet flushing) - Surveillance at a gas station picked him up not 15 miles from here. They can't be far. - Maybe sometime I can make you my specialty. Strawberry pancakes. Does that sound good? - I'm allergic to strawberries. - Right. Maybe just pancakes then. You know you remind me a lot of my little boy. He'd be about your age. - Where is he? - He's in a better place. - You'll have another someday. Close your eyes. (light music) - [Erik] Is he ready? - I put some food and water in there. You sure you don't want me to take you further? - Nah, you done enough. Thank you. - What will you do? - I don't know, I'll think of something. Rather not get you involved any further. - Okay. Good luck. - I may have something here. Let me call you back. - What is it? - [Tom] You the doctor looking for the boy? - Who is this? How'd you get this number? - I want two million. Half now and half when he's recovered. - You have him? - No, but I know where they're going. - Why should I believe that? - 'Cause unlike you, I know how to protect a multi million dollar asset. There's a GPS on them as we speak. - Where are you? (tense music) (festive latin music) (sighing) - Thanks. (speaking in foreign language) - If I had to listen to that a second longer, - I'm only gonna ask one more time and then I start hurting people. They didn't say where they were going? - They didn't say and I didn't ask. - You're not lying, are you? I can always tell a liar. - I ain't lying. - How about you, precious? You know where they might be headed? You don't want anything to happen to your mommy and daddy, do you? All right then. - Marina Forks. It's a campground. - Oh, good girl. - [Maya] Where to? - Into the woods, where there's cover. The deeper we go, the better chance of getting him there in time. If we can get to the river, it should take us all the way to the campsite. From there it's not far. - You really wanna go back in there? - We sit anywhere for too long, they'll find us. There'll be others. We're too exposed out here. You don't have to do this. You could stay here or go back. - What would I go back to? Slinging drinks for minimum wage? Like a storm, right? The only way through it is through it. Let's go. - [Man] What do we do? - Split up. You follow them in. I'll come up from the northern side. Flank them in the middle. (tense music) - [Erik] Why are you smiling? - You're starting to believe him are you? That's why you agreed to take him this far. My prayers are working. - I agree to prove that I'm right. We get there, you'll see there's nothing out there. Nothing miraculous is gonna happen. Prayer's pointless, specially when it's wasted on me. - Are you afraid, if you listen, god won't speak to you or that you won't like what you hear when he does? - I'm not afraid of anything. Besides, maybe we're already dead. - What? - I'm serious, maybe the blackout wiped us all out and this is just in our minds. My dad told me he didn't believe in the afterlife. Maybe we all just hallucinate our last memories for what seems like an eternity. Makes sense, right? (ominous music) - [Maya] What do we do? - There's a ridge behind me, 20 feet. Ready? Go! (gun firing) (screaming) (tense music) - Come on. They'll be back. - You have to keep moving. If we can make it to the river, and follow it all the way. - You can't make it like this. - We have to stay on our feet. What are you doing? - We need to keep pressure on it. Do you have anything left in that flask of yours? It'll do you more good this way. This is gonna hurt. (grunting) - We're running out of light. They'll be circling back. - [Maya] We're not gonna make it, are we? - We'll make it. We have to move. Next time, could you ask to receive your message near the beach? (wolf howling) We need to find shelter. Shelter and a fire. Best thing to do is find some place near a rock. It'll radiate heat back on us. - Won't they see it? - We don't have a choice. We'll freeze out here. Help me get some wood. See this isn't so bad. Like any other camping trip, right? - I don't know. Never been camping before. - This one's ready. He's nothing like me, that's for sure. - You say that like it's a bad thing. - You got a point. - You should change out of those dressings. - What difference does it make anyway? These are our last days. - It makes all the difference. - Where'd you learn all this? - Kids get cut up all the time. - Yeah he, uh, he told me you had a son. - That's right. I know what it's like, loving someone long after they're gone. - What happened? - Car wreck. I came out of it, he didn't. He was tough though. Fought for a whole week. - I'm sorry I misjudged you before. I thought you were just-- - Just a waitress? It's okay. The Nokely legacy's shortsighted anyway. The car wreck, it was out of my hands. It's when I finally figured it out. - What's that? - That if I'm still here, there has to be a good reason. It took losing my son to realize I can't handle everything on my own. That I don't have as much control as I'd like to think. So I trust in a will greater than my own now. I remember the way he used to laugh when he was a baby. That sweet little cackle. Still puts a lump in my throat. I miss that the most. You know, for millions of people, your son is proof of something greater. But to him, you're the proof of something greater. He's a good kid. Whether you realize it or not, you're blessed. Not everyone gets a second chance. - Was it hard to move on? - Yeah. It's the hardest thing I ever did. Just realized I was tired of living numb. Time's something you can't get back. - Die to yourself. That's what you told me, right? - You only die once. You can live every day. (wolves howling) They won't come near the fire, will they? - No, we'll be okay. I'll keep watch. (somber music) - There's something you need to see. - Pack up your things. They're messing with us. We need to make it to the pass by nightfall. We'll be fine as long as we get that far. - You have a plan? - I'm working on it. Can I see that bag of yours? - That's the last one. We used the others on the fire. - We're gonna make it count. (whooshing) (tense music) - You gotta be kidding me. (bird squawking) - They couldn't have gone further than this in the night. Not injured. What do we do? (gun firing) - We're gonna go back the way we came in, flush them out. They're not far. (breathing heavily) - Stop. I can't keep going. Neither can he. I'm sorry. You guys can go. But I can't. I'll catch up with you. - If we don't keep moving, they'll find us. We have to stick together or, - Shh. Do you hear that? (tense music) - Puts things in perspective, right? - [Erik] What's that? - This. All of it. Makes you realize how small we really are. - What about your boy's father? Never mentioned him. - Well, they say a traumatic event will either bring a couple closer or drive them apart. Mine was the latter. We tried to have another baby after the accident. I couldn't get pregnant. It wasn't meant to be. - I'm sorry. - I'm not. I gave it everything I had. In the end it still wasn't enough for the both of us. What is it? - We're here. - Hey, you're that kid, right? Sorry, I just recognized him from TV. You mind if I get a picture with the kid? Right. Everyone's looking for him. It's hard to trust people these days, I get it. How about a drink? I got some whiskey in my pack. - I don't drink and we're kind of tired. - Right. Okay, I'm gonna tuck it in for the night then, cheers. (somber music) (fire crackling) Good night all. Mind if I join you? I got a kid. I don't drink around them either. I won't tell. - [Erik] Sorry about earlier. Been a little on edge. - No need to apologize. - We're being followed. - Whoever it is comes this way, you got nothing to worry about. - You're a cop. - Not just a cop. I'm one that wants you to get where you're going. Your secret's safe with me. And what happens when he gets there, space ship's not gonna come and take him away, is it? - I don't know, maybe. - This kid of yours is the real deal, huh? - About as real as it gets. - Everyone's had some sort of unexplained experience in their life, right? Wouldn't be crazy to believe them. Might be crazy not to believe them. I wish you both the best of luck. I'm turning in. - How about your whiskey? - Finish it. (branches rustling) (ominous music) (tense music) - Caleb! - [Caleb] Dad! (tense music) - Sorry kid. (shattering) (gun firing) (clanging) (gun firing) - Caleb, Caleb. I got you, I got you. You okay? We gotta go, okay? You ready? - I'm tired. - I know. I need you to help me out, okay? When we get out there, you don't stop running until you get to the tree line. Don't look back, you got it? Okay, we go on three. One, two, three! (gun firing) To the trees, Caleb! (bullets whizzing) Okay, rest a minute and we keep moving. (tense music) - I'm tired of running. - Yeah, me too. - Dad! (bashing) (water gurgling) - What happened? Where's Caleb? - He's gone. They took him. - Who took him? - It doesn't matter. We'll never see him again. - No, we'll find him. - We won't. Wake up, Maya. Your son died. You couldn't save him and I can't save mine. Neither can your higher power. There was no one watching out for us. Do you get that yet? Your son is gone. - Thanks for reminding me. Your wife, she died so he could live. - The others, they want to bring you back to that facility. You should have let them. They wanted you for the money. This isn't about the money anymore. Your death shouldn't be at the hands of greed. This is far too important. - You're not gonna turn me in? - Believe me when I tell you, kid. I have no intention of turning you in. Or of you ever leaving this mountain. You were right. We all have a purpose. This is mine. - [Man] It's been confirmed. They found the cop's vehicle off the interstate near the campsite. Someone got to him first. - And the boy? - [Man] Still missing. - Then we're all that's left. - [Man] We have a team en route. What's your move? - They couldn't have gotten far. Let's go find them. - All you have to do is confess. Tell the whole world the truth. That god has nothing to do with this. - I can't do that. - You deceive your followers. Gave them false hope in something that just doesn't exist. No one believes you anymore. Get up, come on! - You don't have to do this. You have a choice. - And you had a choice to prevent this. - What happened to your brother wasn't your fault. - [Gabriel] What'd you just say? - Your brother killed himself when you were 15 after the two of you got into a fight. After your brother died, you stopped believing in anything. And everything. You've blamed yourself ever since, but, it wasn't your fault. (somber music) - Stop. - What happened, are you hurt? - They're coming. We have to go. - I'll get our things. - No. You've done what you have to. Stay here, you'll be safe. You can get off us in a few days. - Almost there. What are you doing? (branches cracking) - [Man On Radio] What is it? - Yeah I'm at the top, we have no visual on the subject, copy. (tense music) (barking) - If you've got a clean shot, take him. Just don't hit the boy. (barking) (helicopter humming in distance) (soldiers shouting over each other) - Drop it now! (gun firing) - Help! (breathing heavily) Someone please, help him! Don't let him die, don't do this again. - [Man] Everyone take a step back. - Where'd this blood come from? - What? - Blood. Were you hit? There's not a scratch on him. - I saw it. The kid took that bullet straight on. - I came all this way to protect you. It was you protecting me. - It's why I asked you to take me. You were in a bad place. But you'll be safer now. - I've never told you before, I love you. - The boy comes with me. Detain him. - Let them pass. - You're under my jurisdiction. - Not anymore. (dramatic music) (reporters shouting over each other) (cameras clicking) - The search has ended for 14 year old Caleb Black. This video was released hours ago while the young boy revealed the last of three secrets. Many believed that his prophecy could change the world in what some are anticipating to be a global extinction event. - [Reporter] Is it true that you believe god speaks to you? - To anyone who will listen. The chastisement is coming. It'll be something supernatural that cannot be explained by science. A correction of the conscience of the world. All need to take shelter and nothing will be the same after. The earth will go black for three days and poison will fill the air. Board up your windows and do not look out. Do not go outside. 'Cause those who do will die. You do not need to be afraid. Life on earth lasts only a moment. Our lives are miracles. You must see them that way. So in the end, love is the only thing that will matter. If there's someone you need to say I love you to, tell them now. I know I'm only a messenger, and the message is one of hope. And when this is over, our time of peace will begin. This is not the end of the world, only the world as we know it. So open your hearts and love. Thank you for answering this call. (reporters shouting over each other) - [Erik] For things to get better, they had to change. And in the end, Caleb was right. The third event arrived as he had warned. Darkness lasted three days, swept across the earth in a wave. Life was different after that. And in those days and minutes when hope seemed lost, our son helped me see a future. One filled with peace. The greatest tragedy isn't death. It's life without purpose. I finally found mine. The miracles never in our eyes allowed us to see in those last days or in the events our son predicted. It was in the heart he changed in the process. He had seen it all along. That it wasn't the end. It was the beginning. (somber music) (intense music)
