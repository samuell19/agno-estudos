Today's episode is located... ...in the beautiful West Sumatra in Indonesia. and we are going to show you a local shaman... ...wo can call a spirit or demon if you will. And kill your enemies using a spinning top... ...called Gasing Tengkorak. Okay, we're done? So, are you ready guys? - Yes. - Let's get started. Okay, as you see, behind me is a house of local famous shaman. And let's see if we can talk to him. Let's go. Are you recording? So, I'm here with the local shaman. And I'm going to ask him about Gasing Tengkorak. - Good afternoon, Sir. - Good afternoon. What can you tell us about Gasing Tengkorak? It is some kind of magical tool to kill a victim. First you have to collect the parts from an old grave. It should be a grave of a child who died by unnatural cause. Then you take the skull. Then you take a piece of bone from the forehead. Gasing Tengkorak is made from that piece. Okay, and how do you use that top? You should take the top to the victim's house... ...and spin it in front of their house. Inside the house, the victim will scream when they see the demon. Spinning top with rope from shroud of the dead On Thursday evening, the night before Friday Gasing Tengkorak, I chant the curse Once the spinning stop, so does your life If we spin the top on victim's property, it will invite bad spirits. They will do harm to the victim. Gasing Tengkorak, send my message And they will avenge for the owner of the top.

You are the only one who can help yourself. You've been doing it your whole life, you have to get up. Michael, I have decided to cancel the rest of my tour. Please, Vero. We've done 37 concerts out of 40. We are almost there. You should consider our sponsors and the event managements. As my manager, you've learnt how to make excuses. One more thing, I want to be alone. Can you find me a secluded house? And I don't want to be disturbed. Okay. Fine. Let's go inside. Please bring the suitcases inside. Welcome, Mr. Michael and Ms. Veronica. Come in, please. Please. You can relax here for as long as you want. This villa is secured with surveillance camera and alarm systems... ...to warn us of any human or animal trespassers. We will serve meal three times a day... ...which are cooked by our five-star chef. To keep your privacy, we will serve the meals on the patio. All right, can you bring the suitcases inside? Yes, Sir. Vero? Vero... You've got some gifts from companies you represent. - I'll put them on the table. - Okay. About your fans letters, do you still want me to reply or... - I'll do it myself. - Okay. All right, I'm gonna leave now. I've arranged doctor's appointment for you. He has prepared everything for your health examination. - I'll pick you up in two days. - I just need a rest. I have to make sure that you're okay. I need the note from the doctor... ...so your sponsors and event managements can't sue you. Whatever. Here. Your phone? Kee p it. If anybody called me, tell them I don't want to be disturbed. - Sure. Take care. - Thanks. Bye. Let's go. What song do you want to write, Vero? A popular song? Or an honest song? You've wrote a lot of popular songs. Let's write an honest song this time. Hey, what are you doing here? Hey! Go away! Hey! I'm warning you! Don't ever come here again! I bet people think I'm a good girl. That's not quite right. I was, but now I don't feel the happiness. I don't even know what I want in my life. My dream was to be me right now. Be a singer and get famous. But if you have to do the same things every day... Working on new albums... ...shooting music videos, do television promos, tours, and stuff. That's a boring life. I no longer find happiness in singing. My life has been commercialized. It's all about money now. The goal now are only about sales, how many sponsors I got... ...how many tickets got sold. "Good" is no longer enough. They want everything to be big, with most profit. Vero, you should be grateful. Everybody loves you. Don't squander your career just because of small stuff. You're just tired, you need a break. Now, go to bed. I'm really sorry for the inconvenience. But there's nothing we can do. No, we won't cancel the show. I promise once Vero gets better, we will continue the tour. What do you say if we do more shows in more cities instead? Don't say sorry It'll only make me even sadder Kill me and go away Take a look at me for the last time Smile like there's nothing happened For when I miss you I'd remember your last smile So I can remember your face Why I'm such a fool Why can't I forget you? Even when you're gone Now You're just a memory Hello, yes. Somebody put a dead animal on the yard. Yes, that means somebody was in this villa. I don't care, I want you to remove it. I'm going out, and I don't want to see it again when I get home. - Excuse me. May I ask you something? - Sure. I'm staying on a big villa on the hill. Can you tell me how to get there? I'm kind of lost here. Poor pretty girl. You should take that road. And if you see a security post, turn right, and then turn left. I see. Thank you Sir. Go Persib! You're welcome Miss. Be careful. Yes! Melissa, there's somebody outside the house. - Are you at your house? - No, I'm at a villa. - Is there anybody else there? - No, I'm alone here. You shouldn't be alone. Empty houses attract bad spirits. Spinning top with rope from shroud of the dead. On Thursday evening, the night before Friday. Gasing Tengkorak, I chant the curse Once the spinning stops, so does your life Gasing tengkorak, send them my message If they're asleep, wake them up If they're up, make them walk Right here, I shall wait Take them, take them before me Make them kneel before me If they close their eyes, make them see Make them suffer, make them know Hello, Mel? Melissa? That woman is here again. This time she's bringing some kind of spinning top. And I think I see ghosts. A spinning top and you see ghosts? - That must be Gasing Tengkorak. - What is that? Gasing Tengkorak is well known in my hometown, Minangkabau. They say it's a tool to curse a person, and it's very dangerous. It took my father's life. You have to destroy it. - Hello? - Hello, Vero. - What are you doing tonight? - Just hanging around in the house. I just want to remind you about doctor's appointment tomorrow. - I know, I remember that. - I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. "Vero, please have a show in Banyuwangi." Hi, Tanti in Banyuwangi. I'd love to. If you want to know details about my tour... ...you can find it in my website. Thank you. The second letter is from Norman. "How can I be a singer like you?" If you want to be a good singer, keep practicing and never give up. Okay, good luck. This one is from Dudi. "When will you release a new album?" Hi, Dudi. Look forward for it. I hope we will release it soon. "You are full of yourself! I'm gonna kill you!" Mr. Fikih! Sorry Miss. I triggered the alarm. Mr. Michael sent me to pick you up, and he asked you to call him. - Hello, Mike. It's Vero. - Hey, you're up early. Then Mr. Fikih is already there to pick you up. That's great. I'm having my breakfast if you don't mind. Can I ask you something personal? I hired you to work. I don't think we should discuss about personal stuff. I just think that you might need a love life. You've been single for too long. First, you're the one who told me to keep my high profile image. Don't date any man who are less famous or less rich than me. and second, I can't stand dating a man who don't understand that my job... ...doesn't have a normal working schedule. If they want a girl with a normal working schedule, just date an employee. One more thing. I don't understand the insecurity of men dating successful women. Like, lighten up, dude. They're so childish. There's no romance anymore in this world. "Notebook" is only a movie. I just thought that aving a boyfriend would make you more relax. At least a man who cares about you, and can take care of you. Mike, I'll see you at the doctor. Mr. Fikih, thanks for the phone. To replace A-the concerts that were cancelled... ...I've arranged some concerts in some more cities for you. Is that okay? Okay, I have no choice anyway. Okay. - Ms. Veronica, would you come with me? - Sure. - I'll wait here. - Okay. I just got the result of your examination and... Accident. Drown. Black. Butterfly. Tired. Bored. You don't understand I'm bored here. Michael? Michael? Okay, Madam Vero. Tell me about yourself. What do you think happened when you fainted on the stage that day? I'm not a Madam. I think you mistook me for my mother. My mother is dead, go talk to her on her grave. How long are you going to keep me here? I've been here whole day, doing some ridiculous tests. I'm fine. Somebody came to the villa last night. Who? Did you invite a guest? It was an uninvited guest. That's impossible. The alarm will go on if trespasser get in the property. One minute she was there, the next she was gone. Don't worry. I'll check to the manager. Hello. Vero just told me that last night there was a trespasser in the village. Okay, let me tell you. I want to send me all the tapes from the surveillance camera. As soon as possible. Okay. It's okay, I've handled it. Mel, I've spent all day at the doctor, and they made me do a lot of tests I almost blew up. You've been to doctors before, you should've known. But if I could sneak out, I'd do that. - But everything's fine, right? - Yes, sure. - But... - But what? Vero? - I'll call you later. - Okay. Who are you? Tania? Where do you live? Why are you here? I'm gonna get you a glass of water.

If they close their eyes, make tem see Make them suffer, make them know What is happening to me? Do I really need to care of what people think about me? Why should listen to them... ...and do everything that they think is good for me? Why do we have to care of what people think about us? Put on a good girl mask, make them think that you're an angel. There's no one in this world who come up as they really are. What you do is just an act. Bullshit. And I'm done. I'm tired of being afraid. I'm tired of people telling me what to do. I just want to be alone. And if I can't take it anymore, that's all on you. Spinning top with rope from shroud of the dead On Thursday evening, the night before Friday Gasing Tengkorak, I chant the curse Once the spinning stops, so does your life Gasing Tengkorak, send them my message Hello.

Michael... - Hello. - Michael, please come here, quick. Vero? Hello? I'm sorry sir. I've been trying to reach you, but you didn't answer. I had to send you this voice mail. Spinning top with rope from shroud of the dead On Thursday evening, the night before Friday Gasing Tengkorak, I chant the curse Once the spinning stops, so does your life We just want to inform you that after thorough examinations... we've concluded that Ms. Vero has paranoid schizoprenia or DID. Dissociative Identity Disorder in the form of multiple personality. Don't you love beach, Sisil? Because I adore beach so much. I've never seen her again after the incident. What I want to discuss with you is one of her personality, Tania. Tania? Tania is here to sign the contract. This is the document and her ID card. Okay, send her in. Hi, Tania. Have they explained to you about the contract? Great, so today we can sign the contract. One more thing, do you want to use a stage name? Veronica. Veronica is an ungrateful child. She didn't help my father when he was drowning. Tania blames Vero for what happened to their father and vows to kill her. Her hatred came from her regret. She saw when her father died from the curse of Gasing Tengkorak... ...cast by another candidate running for a regency leader. She felt guilty, because she couldn't help him. Vero created her character as a Sundanese. - Excuse me. May I ask you something? - Sure. I'm staying in a big villa on the hill. Do you know how to get there? I'm kind of lost. But in reality she's a Minangnesse. Gasing Tengkorak, send them my message If they're asleep, wake them up If they're up, make them walk Right here, I shall wait Tania? Ungrateful child! I'm concerned about her. I'll kill her! Vero! Vero! Vero! ♪ My love for you ♪ ♪ I will keep waiting ♪ We don't know how many personalities she has within her. But I've just discovered one more personality. - Good job, Vero. - Thank you. I want you to meet someone. She'll be here soon. Really? Who? Her name is Melissa. Hey, Melissa! YOU'RE SO FULL OF YOURSELF! I'LL KILL YOU!
