Dear Winston. I so much enjoyed your last letter. The thought of you rescuing a rabbit with a broken leg means poachers trap. I hope the poor baby is mending properly. Sometimes I feel like a rabbit with a broken leg. I struggled through my day trying to keep my spirits up even though I have come to hate what I'm doing. I think that if it wasn't for your letters and the fact that I had a friend like you to talk to. I don't know what I would do. I can't believe that in a city so large in a job where I get to know so many people that I could feel this lonely. Well what are you doing in my office. What's going on here.
