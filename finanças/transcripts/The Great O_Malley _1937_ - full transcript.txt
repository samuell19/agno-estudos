Find that half-baked news-hawk Pinky Holden. Pinky Holden? He is right here. Yes, sir. The Captain wants to see you. It looks like I am going to get a special story. Come in. Nos morituri te salutamus. And in case your Latin is a bit rusty. 'We, who are about to die, salute you'. Sit down. I want to read you something. 'Jackson Street yesterday was the scene of a stirring battle between officer ..' 'James Aloysius O'Malley, the blue-eyed terror of the 7th Precinct'. 'And Signora Theresa Bacciagalupe, housewife and amateur horticulturist'. 'Who weighed in at 310 pounds'. 'The police officer objected to the flowerpots ..' 'Which Miss Signora had placed on her fire escape to brighten her drab view'. 'The good lady's aesthetic soul was so outraged ..' 'By Officer O'Malley's callous indifference to beauty .. ' 'That she promptly made him a present of the pots at a distance of 40 feet'. 'However. O'Malley, courageous as ever when it comes to enforcing the law ..' 'Succeeded in making the arrest'. 'It is reported that O'Malley's only statement was ..' 'There is nothing more beautiful than a badge'. Isn't that cute? - Cute? What you trying to do, make the department ridiculous? Captain, be reasonable. After all, one little yarn .. One? That is the fifteenth story I've read of O'Malley in the past three months. Why pick on one policeman because he is so dumb .. He thinks he can run the whole world on a police manual. O'Malley is good copy. He is an up-and-coming patrolman. He is going to be up and going when you get through with him. And the department will be a laughing stock. It's not our fault the city ordinances haven't been changed .. Since they ruled cows off the street. But it's your fault for keeping the spotlight of publicity turned on us. Will you do me a favor and lay off those freak stories? And particularly O'Malley. It will break my heart if I do that. I just love to watch him pull out that manual. Hey, you. What is the idea of the chimes? They are nice. They make a lot of noise. It is good for business. Bad for the ears. It wakes up the boys in the pool room. It's a good sound. Sweet. Just like the cows make. They take me back to the old country. They'll take you to jail if you don't change them. Now listen to this. 'Article 12. Section 134'. 'No tradesman engaged in the buying and selling of merchandise of any kind ..' 'Shall use or employ any bell exceeding six ounces in weight ..' 'Attached to his vehicle or horse no more than three bells at any one time'. Please. Me no understand. Once more. 'Article 12. Section 134'. The law says you can only have 3 bells and they can't weigh more than 6 ounces. What law? The New York City law. Where did you think it was, Naples? Me an honest man. Me no break the law. Me got eleven kids. - And six bells. So. Nice. What is the matter? Good for business. Do you want to get pinched? - What for? What I do? Take down three of those bells. But .. - Go on now. If I catch you with more than three bells, I'll run you in. Get going. [ Italian language ] Alright, Alright. I'll pull them down. What is the matter with you? Is he looking at us? - What's wrong this time? I fixed everything. Just like he told us. Hey, Nick. Come here. That is still 5 feet 7 inches. You haven't had it fixed yet. I fix when I have money. You're breaking the law. I warned you three times. Please. It hurts anyone? It might. I don't know a thing about it. I don't make the laws. You are violating articles 5, 6 and 42. Come on. Articles 5, 6 and 42. What's this all about? If Your Honor pleases the ordinance reads .. 'Shop awnings without vertical support shall be permitted'. 'But can't extend 6 feet from the street line and be 6 feet beyond the sidewalk'. Thank you. What is the charge? The awning is only 5 feet 7 inches and is clear above the sidewalk. You gave this man sufficient warning, Officer O'Malley? Three times, Your Honor. Why haven't you had it fixed? It costs twelve dollars. I don't have twelve dollars. Business is bad. Very bad. Please. What is wrong? That awning has been like that ever since I had it put up six years ago. How does it happen that you didn't notice this violation until now? I only discovered the ordinance three weeks ago, Your Honor. Are you in the habit of discovering ordinances? It is my duty, Your Honor. I thought the ordinances were made to be enforced. Did you ever hear of such a thing as 'justice tempered with mercy'? I am an officer, Your Honor. Not a judge. You are a very efficient officer, Mr O'Malley. Unfortunately the law is quite specific. You are fined ten dollars. And ten dollars for each day until the ordinance is complied with. But I can't pay. I only make enough to buy food for my family. Maybe later when business is better. Sentence suspended until business is better. Thank you. Yes, yes. I know. Can't you fellows ever realize that you are not policemen just to make pinches? I warn my men repeatedly about making unnecessary arrests. You spend so much time digging up ordinances. So you'll have something to hang on to harmless people trying to make a living. But you haven't time to arrest real criminals. Who are you talking about? I might have known it. That guy's brain is run with nothing but city ordinances. He spends all his time studying his manual. He picks laws out of the air from waste baskets, from graveyards. He thinks of things that were enacted when Times Square was a hog ranch. Yes. You know, Tim. As many times I've read the manual, here's one I never noticed. Chapter 14. Article 22. Section 230. 'No bootblack stand shall be licensed or operated with more than three chairs'. Listen, you law-enforcing flatfoot. Will you take that south side of yours and .. Fit it to the seat of every bootblack stand on your beat. But shut your trap now. O'Malley. Report to the captain. Okay, Sergeant. [ Door knocks ] Come in. You sent for me, sir? - Yes. Sit down. You're a good copper, O'Malley. Thank you, sir. - Too good. Your father was a good cop too. He was different from you. He seldom made arrests. He let his two fists and his nightstick take the place of a jail sentence. It might be a good idea if we used some of his methods more often nowadays. Rats don't like clubs. Now wait a minute. Times have changed, O'Malley. Cops aren't bruisers anymore. They are 'Peace Officers'. Think hard now. Peace Officers. Men whose job is to protect the honest, law-abiding citizen from the crooks. Yes, sir. But we need the people on our side. We want their confidence, their respect. Yes, sir. But we'll never succeed unless you and others like you develop a little tact. And perhaps a sense of humor. Who, me sir? Yes .. even you. There is more to your job than just handing out tickets like confetti. Yes, sir. You've got to remember that people are hard-up nowadays. And fines for minor violations often take the food out of their kid's mouths. But I only enforce the law, sir. I never gave out a phony ticket in my life. I know. The trouble with you is you hand out tickets for laws nobody can remember. With your eagle eye you can probably ticket everybody in town. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. What I am trying to get through your thick head is .. That you have made yourself a pain in the neck to everybody on your beat. You are unreasonable, arbitrary and inhuman. To call you a 'Peace Officer' makes the English language yelp for mercy. My record is okay, sir. Your record? That is all you care about. You need heart, O'Malley. You need something in your veins besides city ordinances. I am asking you to be a regular human being. I do my duty, sir. Get out. Thank you, sir. Yes, sir. Yes. It is your father God rest his soul. And more than once he stood up to this Cromwell and told him where to get off. And you'll be doing the same or you are no son of his. I wouldn't take it to heart, Jim. You've made a fine record. Yes, Father. And I am going to be keeping it that way. If they don't like the laws let the change them. He says you give out too many tickets? [ Door knocks ] Come right in, Mrs Flaherty. Can you spare a quarter pound of butter? - Yes. Indeed. And I'll give you the two eggs I borrowed this morning. Sure. I never gave it a thought. Good evening, Father. - Evening. It's glad I am to see you here. Mrs O'Malley was good enough to ask me to stay to dinner. And a fine one she cooks. And you, James. You look more like your father every day. The eyes. The chin. The spitting image. I swear. We were just taking about his father. Do you remember the night .. My husband threw Flanagan's beer barrels off the sidewalk into the saloon? And Flanagan hit him with a starting handle? I do indeed. And the other men helped Flanagan in the fight? They did that. Did my husband send them to jail? He did not. He sent the seven of them to General Hospital. There you are, James. That captain is jealous of your success .. And he had the same personal spite towards your poor father. Why, they joined the force together. It was politics got him his promotion while your father remained a patrolman. A true blaggard, that Captain Cromwell. His name should be wiped from the face of human history. 'Cromwell's curse' is well said. Well, he is not fighting my father when he fights me. He'll find I am even a tougher customer. But the captain did speak one truth. When he said that the law can be tempered sometimes. With human kindness. I can't agree with you there, Father. It is politics. A foul political move if ever I saw one. Mum. You can't do that. Why not? It's nothing but breadcrumbs. - The law says you can't throw debris .. In the street. - What? Well, rubbish into the streets. - Is that so? Well, law or no law them poor little sparrows is going to get my breadcrumbs. Now listen, mum. You can be arrested for that. Listen. You're talking to your mother. She knows not to violate laws. I've done this for 21 years. - That makes it worse. Just some breadcrumbs. - It's still debris. Your father never objected. What was good for your father .. Isn't good enough for me and I won't allow it. You go too far. I can't help it, Father. I don't make law. And the law says: article 5 section 23. - Oh, bother article 5. It's your mother in her house. - Quiet. I am an officer of the law. Here. Here, you can't do that. Come here now. Come here. Give me one of those. There you are. There. What do you think you're celebrating? Turn that think off. I can't help it office. It is the muffler. I thought it was a violin. Well, get it fixed. I will. I'll have it done today. Is it alright if I go now? No. It's not alright if you go now. Let me see the license. Listen, officer. I'm in a hurry. I'll be late for my job. Sure. I've heard that one before. It is the truth, so help me. It's the first job I've had in years. Then a couple of minutes won't make any difference. You should have started out earlier. - Please, officer. It's very important to me that I get this job. It is terribly important. Will you please write a little faster. If I did nobody could read it. I've got an awful handwriting. Teachers used to tell me at school that I .. I'm not interested in your school life. - Oh? You are a tough guy, huh? Now officer, please. All I want is a ticket so I can get going. I could give you a summons instead of a warning. Report to that address with the muffler fixed or I'll put a warrant out for you. One man's good luck is another man's tough luck. That is all, boys. Nothing doing. My name is Phillips. I was supposed to start work here this morning. I'm sorry. You're too late. Your job has been filled. - I'm only a few minutes late. That is too bad. There have been too many men around here since six o'clock waiting for jobs. Will you be putting on any more men? I don't know. - But listen. I couldn't help it. I was stopped by a policeman. Look. I can prove it. Here is the ticket. - Tough luck, buddy. Now look what happened to Imogene. Evening, Mr Phillips. - Evening. I heard you got a job today. Yes. I got a job. That's fine. You've been out of work a long time, haven't you. Yes. I have. Well, good luck to you. Thank you. Mummy. Yes, darling? - Daddy is coming. At last. Mummy. Tell me. Now that daddy has a job. Will he become president of the company? - Oh yes. Your daddy is a very smart man, Barbara. Now that he has started again you will have everything you want. Really? - Uhuh. Daddy. Hello, darling. John. Wasn't it exciting to be back at work again? Yes .. very. You had better clean up. Dinner is ready. Are you tried, John? Yes. I am a little. Was it hard work, daddy? - No, darling. No work is hard. Let me take your coat. Alright. And you hang it up for me, will you? Watch this, Imogene. So the next time you can do it. Everything is going to be alright now. Yes. Everything is going to be alright now. I need ten dollars. - So do I. How much? Three dollars. And that is too much. Listen, mister. If I didn't need the money you couldn't get those medals for a thousand dollars. Did I ask you for them? Medals are a drag on the market. What about the gun? That is what I am giving you three dollars for. Guns you can always sell. I have got to have ten dollars. I don't want it for myself. I have got a wife and child. I have to buy food for them. Why don't you go on relief? The government has got more money than me to hand out to you fellows. I don't ask favors from anybody. I will take care of myself. Didn't you ask me to give you ten dollars for that junk? Junk? Well, they are junk. - Don't you say that again. Operator. Operator. Give me police headquarters. Quick, quick. New York Police department calling car 128. Car 128. "A hold up." "A pawnshop at 437 Grand Street." "That is all." Alright, little man. Give me your license. The trouble with you guys is .. You think you can drive round breaking any laws you like. Well, you can't, see. We've got laws and we're going to enforce them. What is this? Is he dead? No. He is alright. - Did anybody see this? I saw a suspicious-looking guy leave here. Where did he go? He drove away in a Model T touring car with a broken muffler. Operator. Police headquarters. New York Police department calling all cars. Calling all cars. Pick up a touring car Model T. With broken muffler. Well, I gave you plenty of warning. Now you get a summons. I told you to get that muffler fixed. What are you laughing at? You haven't been drinking, have you? - No. Well. Here. The next time you see a cop maybe it won't be so funny. Hey, O'Malley. Come here. Seen anything of a Model T touring care with a broken muffler? I did. I just gave the driver a ticket. What for? - For a broken muffler. Nice work, O'Malley. The guy just stuck up a pawnshop and tried to kill the owner. Got away with over 400 bucks and you give him a ticket for a broken muffler. I must .. Maybe he isn't the one. Well. If he isn't we'll buy you flowers, sweetheart. 'Phillips had just committed the hold-up and was making a getaway ..' 'When officer O'Malley, always alert of his responsibility to uphold the law ..' 'Stopped him for the criminal act of driving a car with the muffler broken'. 'Some bystanders said that O'Malley has a particular dislike for open mufflers'. 'As they disturb his slumbers'. Order in the court. Your Honor. John Phillips is not a criminal. But a victim of circumstances. And of an overzealous cop. Counsellor. If this policeman hadn't stopped him for a petty violation .. He would be working today. Earning money to support his wife and crippled child. You heard the defendant testify he was on his way to his first job in years. When you stopped him for a minor traffic violation. Yes, sir. Did the defendant beg you to let him go so he wouldn't be late for his job? Yes, sir. - Why didn't you let him go? It was my duty to warn him about the muffler. The law says .. We are all cognisant with the law. But isn't there a greater law that comes first? The more humane law of 'reasonable doubt'? Of mercy. Your Honor, I object. I cannot see how all of this had any bearing on the case. This man is clearly guilty of a crime. Rise. The County Court Division 6, Judge Evans presiding is now in session. Be seated. The people versus John Phillips. Have you anything to say? Before judgement is passed on you? John Phillips, it is the judgement of this court. In compliance with the law. That you be confined in the state prison for a term of from two to ten years. Mary. John. Please don't let them take you away from me. 'John Phillips has been sentenced from two to ten years in the penitentiary'. 'An obscure unimportant person'. 'The trial attracted little attention'. 'And yet because of its peculiar circumstances ..' 'It arouses some disturbing questions'. 'How many men have been driven to crime by this type of petty prosecution?' 'Is the police department ..' 'Giving so much time to worrying about minor infractions of the law ..' 'That it has none left for the prevention or solving of major crimes?' 'The case of John Phillips and his broken muffler makes us wonder'. What have you to say about that? Ah. The newspapers are always picking on the police. If I hadn't given that guy Phillips a ticket we might never have caught him. As it was, we picked him up in no time. And that's all you get out of it, eh? Don't you realize that you practically drove a man to crime? But I only did my duty. What more can I do? Nothing. That's what is wrong with you. We need men on the force that can do a little more than just their duty. O'Malley. I suggest you resign. No. No. I won't resign, sir. I see no reason why I should. I like the work. I think I am doing alright. If I wasn't, you'd bring charges against me and make me turn in my shield. Alright. We'll see if we can't make you turn in your shield yourself. Charles Egan. - Here. John Flynn. - Here. Carl Hendy. - Here. Henry Dugan. - Here. James A. O'Malley. - Here. Officer O'Malley will report for school crossing duty at Govan and Henry Street. You will devote your entire attention .. To safeguarding the children on their way to and from the school. And allow routine police matters to be taken care of by an officer on the beat. To ensure complete cooperation from the children. You will address the pupils on safety. You'll report to the Principal's office and take your instructions from her. That is all. Right face. Forward march. This will either make or break him. Thank you very much, officer. You are so kind. What are you doing here? I heard about your new job, O'Malley. Congratulations. So you did. I suppose you are down here to get out of the first grade? No. I just came to hear your scholarly address to the dear little kiddies. Let me tell you something. I don't think .. - That's right. Don't think. Just talk. Good morning, children. Children, stand. "I pledge allegiance to my flag." "And to the republic for which it stands." "One nation." "Indivisible." "With liberty and justice for all." Be seated. Today, I can happily announce .. We are privileged in having our own police officer at the school crossing. A man with a great love of little children. A man with great human understanding. One who will see that each and every one of you .. Is safeguarded to your classroom. One of that brave body of men. Who have devoted their lives. To protecting us from danger. Mr James Aloysius .. O'Malley. Some cop, huh? Aloysius? What a funny name. It's a very nice name. I like it. Saint Aloysius was very kind to little children. Mr O'Malley, I would like you to speak to the children. On the subject of safety. The police department of this city .. Consists of the uniformed force and the detective branch. The duties of the uniformed police. Is to enforce the law. To issue summonses in cases of misdemeanours. And in case of felonies to make arrests. It is also an important part of our job .. To see that the crossings are kept safe for the average citizen. That is, for you children. The idea is, each time you cross the street you must look in both directions. Don't cross the street at all. Only at school crossings. As provided for in .. 'Article 12, Section 134 which states that ..' That's to say I'll be out there on the corner looking after you. All you have to do is .. Never leave the kerb until I signal for you to cross. If you do that and watch yourself .. We will all get along fine. That's all. "My country, tis of thee." "Sweet land of liberty." "Of thee I sing." "Land where my fathers died." "Land of the Pilgrim's pride." "From every mountain side." "Let freedom ring." Who's responsible for those children sitting in the aisle? I am. You know you're violating section 231 of the fire code? You've the kids in the aisle so they .. - Officer O'Malley. The fire department inspects our school twice a month. If there is any violation of regulations I'm sure we'll hear from them. No use picking fights with the police. - Why don't you attend to your business? Another word out of you and I'll give you a summons instead of a warning. Hey, policeman. Are you going to be here every day? I hope not. Alright. Come on. Mr policeman, did you always have flat feet? Wait a minute now. Alright. Come on. Come on. Come on, little girl. Hurry up now. I am sorry. My leg. Well. Alright. Take your time then. Are you always so cross? Cross? What do you mean 'cross'? You know. Mad. Don't you like children? Sure. Sure I like children. You don't act like it. That is alright. Don't you worry about that. [ Car horn. Loud ] You wait right here. Alright, big-shot. What you making all the noise about? - What's the matter? Can't you get that gimpy kid across the street? I can't wait here all day. So you can't, eh? Ain't that too bad. Oh. A trough cop, eh? Yeah. I am one of the toughest. Come on, give me your license. What for? What do you think I'd want it for, to frame it? Come on, hurry it up. You can't get away with this. My uncle is a judge. So he is? - Yeah. Then maybe he'll try the case and it will be a family affair. You are going to be sorry for this. - Oh no. You're the one that is going to be sorry. You are violating the law. Article 12. Section 125 prohibits sound of horn unnecessarily on school streets. When I go to the kerb and blow the whistle you can go ahead. And from now on, little boy. Behave yourself. Alright, darling. We will go now. Before the judge's nephew has a stroke. Do you give your tickets to many people? Well, yes. Quite a few. Would you give me one too? Well, I might now if you didn't behave yourself. Do you want to get killed? Well, I came awfully close. Why don't you get those brakes fixed? All the brakes in the world won't do any good with your signals. What's wrong with my signals? Alright. I suppose it's my fault. Go and write out your ticket. Who said it was your fault? - You did. I did not. I said it was the brakes. - I told you I had them fixed. They sound like it. They stopped, didn't they? More than you're able to do. That's more than I ..? Who me? Come on now. Quit that or I'll run you all in. Quit that. Come on. Get up there. Now listen, young fellow. I am going to tell you something. Nice work, O'Malley. I bet it took a lot of nerve to break that up. Listen, you two gorillas. Why officer O'Malley, such language you are about to use. I won't stay and listen to it. ?Thank you, Jim. How are you, Jim? Hello, Father. - Well. How did the first day on the crossing go? Pretty good. Fine. You look a little tired. Well, if you think chasing 500 kids from kerb to kerb is any cinch you are crazy. I am sorry, Father. - That is alright. Did you like the children? Yes. They were alright. There was one awfully cut kid that .. Most of them get in your hair. And in your heart sometimes. That's your job, Father. But being a crossing patrolman is not mine. I don't want any part of it. Lots of times we don't like things that are good for us. Will you come in? No thanks. I've a meeting at the settlement house. Give my regards to your mother. - I will. Goodbye, Father. - Goodbye, Jimmy. I disagree with Father Patrick. I tell you again, it's a foul political move on Captain Cromwell's part. You go right ahead and do that job as well as you've done all the others. And he will have to promote you. And like it. Not if he can help it, he won't. - That's a terrible thing. How? - Here. You won't do that to me when I have my Sergeant's chevrons. Oh, yes I will. Mrs O'Malley. Yes, Mrs Flanagan? What is it? How many cups of flour do you use to make them dumplings? I don't use cups. I use my fist. Ma. How old were you when you got married? My boy. Oh. I am so glad. What? Why, that's alright. You needn't be shy with your mother. I don't know what you're talking about. - A girl. I haven't any girl. It's a girl you'll be marrying someday. - I am not going to be married. Ever. That's just what your father said. And it wasn't ten days afterwards until we were standing up before the priest. Yes. I remember Pop saying you caught him off guard one day. He did, did he? Well, I'll let it be known that he proposed to me eleven times. And what's more. I turned him down every time. - Except the last, beautiful. None of your blarney now. Go on with your work. Good morning, Officer O'Malley. Good morning, darling. How are you this morning? Fine, thank you. I brought this for you. That is fine. Thank you. But .. Maybe you'd better keep it yourself. I just had a big breakfast. Let's divide it. Then we'll both have it. Alright. We will do that. There you are. You know, I dreamt about you yesterday. Well. So you dreamt about me. I guess it was a nightmare, huh? Oh no. I dreamt that you came to our May party. And you were the king. And you gave everybody a ticket. Even me. A queen. So I did? When is the May party? Tomorrow. Miss Nolan is taking us to the park. And I am the queen. So, you are the queen. Have you got a crown? - No. Not yet. As long as I'm the king I'll take care of that. Oh, goody. There is Tubby. Hello officer. I brought Spot along to help you out today. What is the rig for? I fixed it up for you last night. George's dog Spot. Come on, Spot. You know what to do. Now come on. Why, Officer O'Malley. That is the first time I've ever seen you smile. Yeah. You have such a nice smile. Why do you want to frown so much? He doesn't frown, Barbara. A policeman has to look that way. But don't let it bother you, O'Malley. Women are funny that way. Yeah. Yeah. I guess maybe you're right. Thanks. Come on, darling. Let's go across the street. Why, Mr O'Malley. I didn't think it possible you could carry a child with such tenderness. He is very nice, Miss Nolan. Of course he is, dear. Are you getting married? Tubby. It would be very fine, you know. Goodbye, Mr O'Malley. - Goodbye. Goodbye. And don't forget to look for me tomorrow. Remember. You promised me a crown for the May party. Look now, Miss Nolan. He is smiling. "Lovely May, lovely May." "Makes the world so fresh and gay." "Sunshine here and sunshine there." "Flowers everywhere." "Working like a busy bee." "Little children you will see." "Lovely May, lovely May." "Ever fresh and gay." "Lovely May, lovely May." Are you ready, children? Yes, Miss Nolan. No. The queen isn't. She hasn't her crown yet. Well, where is it? Officer Jim. Officer Jim. My crown. I could have made you a crown too. I know. But officer Jim asked me first. And I didn't want to hurt his feelings. Besides, he is a policeman. And I would like to have him as a friend. You are not jealous are you, Tubby? Here you are, darling. I hope it doesn't rain now. It looks pretty cloudy. Well, I'll be seeing you. - Wait. Don't you want to see me as the queen? No. I'll see when you come by. I've got to get back to the crossing. The umbrellas. Now that's a fine thing. Cheer up, children. Cheer up. We can have a party some other day. "Rain, rain. Go away." "Come again another day." "Rain, rain. Go away." "Come again some other day." Rain, rain. Please to stay. Good for my business today. Umbrellas. Umbrellas. - Hey, you. No, I don't want an umbrella. Let me say this. If it rains another drop .. And you're still here I'm going to hold you responsible, you rainmaker you. I don't make the rain. I just make the umbrellas. Oh boy. The rain has stopped. Look. Barbara. Miss Nolan. Barbara is outside. Officer Jim. Officer Jim. Barbara. Come back. Barbara, watch yourself. You see, darling. I told you not to cross the street. Is she hurt? No. Nothing serious. She's going to be alright. My head hurts. Why did you run out in the rain, darling? Because I promised officer O'Malley I'd let him see me as the Queen. Oh, my head. Let's take her home. - Alright. Here is where I live. I'd like to be carrying you six more flights. Where is the key? - Under the mat. You'd better get some hot milk ready. There you are now darling. It's going to be alright. We'll have it fixed in no time. Just lie quiet now. I can't find any milk. In fact, there doesn't seem to be anything around here. Wait a minute. Here. You'd better go down to the store and .. Get some groceries. You know better than I do what to get. Wait a minute. You may as well get a lot of food. You know. Someday, officer O'Malley, I may have to apologise to you. Be back in a minute, darling. Alright. We'll be waiting. I was talking to Barbara. That's alright now, darling. It's not even cut. It's just a lump. Imogene has got a cut on her head. She has? Who is Imogene? Your sister? No. My daughter. That's her over there in my buggy. Ah. So this is Imogene. And you are her mother. Hasn't she got a father too? Oh yes. He is with my daddy in Canada. They have a job up there. Canada? That is pretty far away for a daddy, isn't it. Yes. Mummy said he didn't want to go so far. But he had to. To earn money for us. Oh. I see. See that picture over there? That is my daddy. Oh. So that is your daddy, huh? You didn't think it was Imogene's daddy, did you? Imogene's daddy has red hair. What is the matter? Don't you like my daddy? Oh, yes. Sure I do. He. He looks like an old friend of mine. Babs. What is the matter, darling? It's alright, mummy. It was just a bump on the head. And officer O'Malley brought me home. Officer O'Malley? Where is Barbara? Is this all you brought? The rest will be delivered. I took along what I thought we'd need. Do you think buying me food will make me forget what you did to my husband? Now, Mrs Phillips. If you try to understand I was only doing .. If I hear you say you were only 'doing your duty' I will go mad. I'm sorry. Sorry? Will that bring my husband back? Don't you see? I didn't know. There is a lot you don't know, Officer O'Malley. There is lots you will never know. Couldn't you see that my husband was telling you the truth? But then I suppose it wouldn't have made any difference if you had. If there was only something I could do. You can leave me and my family alone. You have done enough harm. Hello. I thought I'd wait and see if Barbara was alright. Why? Does your conscience bother you? Now, don't you think that's a little unfair? After all, I didn't arrest Phillips, now did I? You are stupid, aren't you. Think hard, Mr O'Malley. How many beg to let them go as they're too poor to do what the law expects? Don' you see? I didn't want .. - Can't you understand? It isn't only Phillips. It's the whole parade of Phillipses and Barbaras. And heaven knows how many Mrs Phillips. You're not a human being. You are a machine. You are right. You are always right. That is what is wrong with you. Come on. Can't we play pony tag? Who's going to be 'it'? Alright. You can be 'it'. - Sure. Get out of the way, gimpy. You can't play with us. You can't run fast enough. Now sit over here. What's the matter, darling? Everybody. Everyone has been blaming me. They do? Why is that? On account of my leg. Dr Larson will see you now. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Officer O'Malley. What can I do for you? - Well. First of all I'd like to be asking a few questions. Very well. Shoot. You. You're the same Dr Larson that operated on that famous Russian violinist? That is right. A tenoplasty on his left hand. Teno ..? Yeah. You addressed the medical profession in Baltimore? Guilty. Well. I have looked over all the doctors in town. I have decided you are the one to handle this case. That is very fine. I am very flattered. What is it? I want you take care of a little girl. With a lame leg. What happened to it? - It is broken. At the time her, father was out of work and couldn't give it his attention. It has got to be reset. Is this father a friend of yours? Well. No. I met him in the line of duty. But the kid is one of the sweetest .. - Excuse me. Yes? Mrs Forsythe? What was that case? I remember. I remember. A spinal fusion. Well, you'd better make the bill say .. Five thousand dollars. Yes. Hey. Wait a minute, O'Malley. What are you running away for? Well. Thinking it over, I decided you are not the one to handle this case after all. Why not? This woman hasn't got five thousand dollars. She is on relief and barely able to get by. Her husband is in .. - I understand. See, I planned to take fifty bucks out of my salary every month .. Alright. Take fifty bucks out of your salary and put them in a savings bank. I'll take care of the child. I don't want you to handle this case for nothing. Will you let me worry about that? You have that little girl here at two tomorrow. I wouldn't hesitate a minute, Mrs Phillips. What a blessing for Barbara to be able to play again with the other children. I don't understand why such a famous doctor takes such interest in Barbara. He saw her as he was passing by the school. He does a lot of charity work. Among children. Wonderful work. I don't know what to say, Father. Perhaps I ought to get my husband's consent. He would be willing, Mrs Phillips. Think how happy he'll be when he comes home to see Barbara running to meet him. Would you go to the hospital with me? - Of course. Alright then, Father. It is awfully nice of you. And nice of the doctor too. Nonsense, Mrs Phillips. Nonsense. I still can't understand the doctor's interest. Lots of people have kindness in their hearts. That you would never suspect. The little girl looked awful white. Do you think she's going to be alright? I really couldn't say. I'm not familiar with the case. For the love of Pete .. Do you have to keep reading those dope sheets to answer a simple question? All I want to know is, will she be okay? Not so loud, O'Malley. The little girl needs rest. I am sorry, doctor. How is she? In a few weeks she'll be running around like any other child. But right now she needs a lot of rest and quiet. That is fine. I'll see she gets plenty of that too. [ Whistling ] [ Whistling ] Quiet. Quiet. Can't you read? You are disturbing the peace. Hello. Hello, darling. How you been feeling today? And how is Imogene? - Imogene is alright. But my leg hurts. Sure it does. But that is going to be alright pretty soon now. I remember one time my daddy told me something that an old Indian told him. No smart. No heal. My daddy used to tell me stories too. I wish he could come home again. He will come back from Canada, won't he? Sure he will. But you got to get all well so you can surprise him. It hurts, don't it. Now it's going to be alright in no time. It's time for her to go to sleep now. Sure. She needs some rest. Will you come again tomorrow? I would like to see them keeping me out. Goodnight, officer Jim. Goodnight, darling. Pleasant dreams. Goodnight, darling. Who's in charge here? I am. What are all those men doing out there? They're waiting for jobs. - They are? You're maintaining a public nuisance. By using that street as a waiting room for an employment office. What shall I do, bring them in here? - Alright. Listen to this. Article 3 section 23 of the New York code of ordinances states .. 'No person shall encumber, obstruct any street or other public place ..' 'By loafing around in or about the same to the annoyance of passers-by'. Nobody has ever complained before. Be reasonable. Sure will. If you will be. I get it. - You don't get it at all. Do you remember a fellow named Phillips? Why should I? - Why shouldn't you? You gave his job to somebody else because he was about five minutes late. Five minutes late. Was that reasonable? Was I reasonable giving him a ticket for a petty traffic violation? No. Well we are starting in right now. If you don't give this Phillips a good job when I get him out. I'll start tearing this factory apart with every ordinance I ever knew. Yes, but .. - And brother .. I know my ordinances. And believe me, gentlemen. There are thousands just like Phillips. Honest, decent, self-respecting men who .. Through no fault of their own have lost their jobs. He is a fellow who's had tough breaks. That's all. At the time of the crime he was in need. Now his family is in want. I happen to know that facts of the case. Gentlemen, I will not only guarantee him a position. But you can hold me responsible for his future. If you will only give him a parole. Did you hear Phillips is going home? I hear you are getting out of here. - Yes. Tomorrow. I'll give you some addresses of some regular guys. They will fix you up. No thanks. I've got a job. They've all got jobs when they first get sprung. But try to keep it. Buddy, you are an ex-con. Them cops will hound you day and night until they get something on you. And then back again you'll come for a longer stretch. Why should they pick on me? I am no criminal. You are in here, ain't you? You'll be back again too. You ain't got a chance with them cops once they know you are an ex-con. I don't believe you. You don't, eh? Well, you take it from a guy what knows. Watch what happens when you go home. Hello, Phillips. How are you? Glad to see you back. - Hello Jake. O'Malley is looking for you. O'Malley? Yeah. He wants to see you before you go home. What for? Now what do you suppose O'Malley wants to see anyone for? Come on in. I'll buy you a drink. No thanks. Paper. Paper. Mr Phillips, that cop O'Malley has been looking for you. Paper. Hello, Mr Phillips. - Hello. O'Malley. He wants to see you. Say. O'Malley is looking for you. Look John. O'Malley has been looking for you. I know how you feel, Phillips. No. You don't want any more. You'd only be giving O'Malley a good excuse to send you back. So that is what he wants. That's the old routine. You know. He just wants to warn you that he's keeping his eye on you. What can I do? I don't know. If it was anyone else I would tell you to stay put and take your chances. But O'Malley? No. He won't give you a chance. He'll just keep on hounding you until he puts you away again. He'd better leave me alone. There is nothing to be worried about, Mrs Phillips. I can hardly wait until he gets here. Mummy. Couldn't I go downstairs and wait for daddy? No, darling. He asked us to be here. You have to wait for him, darling. Besides, I haven't finished this. Miss Nolan. What do you think daddy will bring me? A nice cradle for Imogene? She needs one. John. Oh, my darling. What are you doing here? - Is Phillips home? He doesn't want to see anyone now. Particularly you. I got to see him. Why? Does the law have to be enforced again? Well. You see, it is kind of a secret between us. Secret? I felt it may be nice for Barbara if her dad brought her some toys from Canada. So. What I did was, I went out and got some for him to give to her. You won't tell her, will you? - No. Wait here for me. I will. Now let's see you walk back again. Isn't it wonderful? - Yes, darling. It is wonderful. I'm so happy that your leg is all well again. That you're able to play with the other kids. Are you going back to Canada? No, darling. I am never going back to Canada again. I'd rather not .. - You mustn't think any more about it. We've got to get away from here as fast as we can. Go way out in the country somewheres and get a little place where nobody .. [ Door knocks ] [ Door knocks ] Shall I open it? No, darling. I had better go. Officer O'Malley. Hello. Is Mr Phillips in? Hello, officer Jim. Come in. Come in. Daddy is here. Hello Phillips. I'd like to see you outside for a minute. A swell kid you have in there, Phillips. - You'd better leave me alone, O'Malley. You haven't been drinking, have you? Supposing I have? - Now, you know what that means. Alright. I have been drinking. I had to do something to get the name O'Malley out of my ears. That's all I heard on the way home: 'O'Malley wants to see you'. O'Malley. O'Malley. That's right. I do want to see you. - You won't hound me back to jail again. Come on, Phillips. Get hold of yourself. You got a grand kid in there and a swell wife and they need you. But if this keeps up you go back into .. - That means you'll keep an eye on me? You're going to watch every move I make. See that I obey the law and live up to my parole. Sure. It might be a good idea if I do. - You try it and I'll kill you. Phillips, if a parole agent knew you had that gun you'd go right back in again. You will never tell them. You have hounded me enough. It was your fault I lost my job. Your fault I went to jail. You took me away from my family but you are not going to do it again. You'd better give me that gun. Give me that gun! Give me the gun. O'Malley. O'Malley. O'Malley. Don't you scream at my son. It's all your fault. Shush. Quiet. Quiet. O'Malley, this is Cromwell. Don't you know me? Cromwell. I want to know who shot you. Was it Phillips? I never took a dime in my life. In the bag. School crossing. Save fifty bucks a month. Watch yourself, Barbara. Watch yourself. It's no use. He'll pull through, doctor? Of course he will. But you've got to leave him now. It was just the same with his father, rest his soul. Some thieving scoundrel stopped him. May I see him now? - I'm afraid not. Why don't you come back in the morning? Alright. Thank you. It's getting terribly late, Barbara. We must go home. No. I won't go home. Officer Jim hardly ever went home when I was in the hospital. I didn't know he came to see you. He didn't want anyone to know that he'd gotten the doctor to fix my leg. Who told you that? I heard the nurses talking about it. Didn't you know? No, I didn't. He never told me a word about it. I wonder why. Daddy. Daddy. - Barbara. Come on, come on. Darling. You had better stay here with mother. Just a moment. Jimmy. How do you feel? Pain. Who are you? Cromwell. Don't you know me? I am a sick man. I should not be having any visitors. What do you say, doctor? He's still pretty weak. I'm afraid he may even need a blood transfusion. Can I question him? It will only take a moment. Well, alright. But don't excite him. Come in, Phillips. I've seen a lot of men in my time but none like you. Trying to kill a man who got you parole, a job, and had your child's leg fixed. He didn't do that. - He did. Miss Nolan says he simply wanted to see you to give you some toys for the child. And this is the way you repay him. We know Phillips shot you, O'Malley. We simply want you to identify him. How long have you been on the force, Cromwell? What is that? In this country a man is innocent until he is proven guilty. We are going to prove it. I don't know where you got the idea Phillips shot me. He was giving me the gun so he wouldn't get into trouble with the parole board. As he gave it to me, I .. I tripped over some toys and fell down the stairs and .. The gun went off. That's your story. Sure. And I'm sticking to it. You are crazy, O'Malley. We'll give this fellow from ten to twenty years. Cromwell, you don't know what you do to the man's family if you jail him again. All you think of is enforcing the law. What I am trying to tell you is to be a regular human being. What you need, Cromwell .. Is heart. Heart. I am sorry. You will have to leave. How is he? - He's getting weaker. Get ready for a blood transfusion. Go on. Give it to him. Give him everything he needs. The best of everything. There's nothing too good for a good cop. I don't know how I'll ever be able to thank you enough, O'Malley. Well, you are giving me your blood, aren't you? All I'm hoping is you are Irish. My folks came from England. English? That is all I wanted to know. Please. You mustn't move. I know, Doc. But how am I going to get well? Now, now. It won't hurt you a bit. Say, Doc. Do me a favor will you. Don't tell my mother you put English blood into me. Hello, Mrs O'Malley. - Hello, Father. Why didn't you tell me? - What? That your son Jim is .. Back on his old beat again. Sure he's back. Didn't I always tell you that Cromwell thought the world of Jim? A fine gentleman is Cromwell. Good morning, O'Malley. - Hello, Jake. Glad to see you back. - Thanks. I'm glad to be back. Morning, O'Malley. - Hi, Sal. Morning, O'Malley. - Morning, Ben. Welcome. Welcome Mr O'Malley. - Thank you. Now, wait a minute. Why don't you let the awning down? What can I do? It isn't fixed. Oh. It's fixed. How are you all? Hello darling. - We missed you. Are you coming back to the school crossing? Not officially. I'll come back once in a while to see everything is alright. Did you see that, Miss Nolan? Well now. Where are you going? - Taking the children to the park. You got a better break this year. The weather is on your side. Won't you go with us? I would like to, honey. But .. I can't be leaving my beat. Not even if the whole school invites you? Well, under those conditions. I'll have to weaken. - Okay. I bet you a dime to a lollipop they are in love. How do you know? I can tell by the look in his eyes. You can't fool me. Miss Nolan, couldn't you ask him? Yes, I could. As a matter of fact, I could ask him many things. Hey, hey. What's the idea of stopping your bus in a safety zone? The kids asked me to stop. They want .. - Oh. I see. And if the kids ask you to jump off the Empire State Building you'd do that too? Come on. Let's see your license. Listen, officer. The kids wanted .. I suppose you'd like me to give this ticket to the kids? It wouldn't surprise me if you did. What's the idea of the wisecracks? You are a cop, ain't you? Don't you know that the law says .. - You are going to tell me about law? I've forgotten more law than you'll ever know. Giving out tickets like confetti. What you ought to have is tact. A sense of humor. The trouble with you guys is you're too anxious to give out tickets. ..t-g..
