Nathan. Are you okay? Dad and I fought. Did he whip you? No, he got tired. and then he tried to find you... ...to say goodbye. Oh... I was out looking for my kingdom. What's that? It's where my thoughts become real. What do you think about? I think about having lots of different friends and having the power to do whatever I want, like being a princess. I take all those thoughts and keep them safe in my kingdom. It's a special place. It's probably somewhere near the mountains. There is evil that wants to destroy the kingdom, but as long as we stick together, evil will not find it. There is a kingdom for every man, woman, and child. Doubts and fears climb inside each of us to destroy it. There is a guardian. It guides us, helps us to find our path. Laura, do I have a kingdom? Yes. Will you help me find my kingdom? I will never stop looking for it. Promise? I promise. - You're brave, Laura. - I know! Shh. Baby, let's take this back to my place, okay? Hurry up, I don't have all day. This is not an accident. Put on some clothes, Nathan. You should have been home yesterday. I hate you! Why is he here? I work my ass off to make sure we pay the bills, to keep us from living like this. You asshole! Hey, Laura, is everything okay? Nathan! Oh my God! Nathan, stop. Make him stop! Get him off of me. - Get him off of me. - What are you doing? Stop laughing, you're a grown man. You know that's it. I'm disappearing now and you'll never see me again. Where are you going? - I'm stepping out of this hell. - I'm coming with you. No, you're staying here and cleaning up this mess. Okay. Let's first go over the facts. Nathan is autistic and I am supposed to evaluate whether you, Laura, are capable of caring for him. This is my fifth visit this month, nonetheless, I am supposed to give each of you the benefit of the doubt and write a report before any final decisions are made. Stop. So, who wants to go first? Nathan... How do you feel about Laura? Is she your friend? No, she's not. She's my little sister. That's more important to me than friendship. What's going on with you? The only reason you're here is because Nathan got upset that I left him home alone. I tried to explain to him that he's a grown man and he needs to start acting like one. You might be asking Nathan for the impossible. What if I said to you, "Laura, you are a grown woman and you need to start acting like one." What would you do differently? I need to go to work. Think about what you want to do and make a decision before he or someone around him gets hurt. - State law requires... - State law? Nathan and I have been together our whole lives. I'm not surrendering him. State Law requires that we follow up to see what immediate changes you are making to better accommodate Nathan. And if something like this happens again? You may lose whatever custody you think you have of him. For his safety and anyone he hurts, you're liable for that. Here's another one of these and my card. You need to contact me within two days and use those two days to get yourself together. Something on your mind, Laura? She told me I can't let you out of my sight. Do you know what that means? It means that we get to be together. It means I can't go to work. Take me with you. I need you to promise me that you will never flip out like that again. - I promise. - Again. - I promise. - Again. I need to know that you understand what I am telling you. I promise. Because if you don't keep your promise that bitch social worker is going to take you away and you'll never see me again. I really messed up this time, Laura. I'm sorry. Just listen to what I'm telling you. It's easy. Do you remember the rules about the truck? Don't... Don't play with the gears, don't honk the horn, and most of all... Don't leave the truck. Never leave the truck. Just draw in your book or something. I'll be back as soon as I can. Hey, man. What are you doing up there? - Shit! - Ah! All right, everybody. Ten minutes to the curtain, let's go! You guys, this is it. Eight months we've been doing this, it's time for the big payoff, you guys. First impressions are the only impressions. I guarantee you, you guys will go someplace if you bring your game. You should have let that social worker arrest him or something. You obviously don't get it. People have been abandoning Nathan and I our whole lives. I'm not gonna do the same to him. So, life's hard. We made it this far. We keep going. Make sure you bring it tonight like you've never bought it before. This is where we get paid. - He's dangerous. - He's not dangerous. You just don't know him like I do. He's got a lot going on in his head. He can be sensitive. I have to believe that things will get better. Somebody is going somewhere far from this performance tonight. Less than ten, everybody, let's go. I need your support. Hello. Who is this? No, no, no. Listen, this is a misunderstanding. There is no way that guy is my brother. I don't know how he got my name and number. My brother is right here waiting for me. So, whoever this is, you're full of... Shit! My brother got into some trouble. I need to pick him up right now, or he's gonna get arrested. You can't go anywhere. Listen, doesn't he have like a safe place he can go to or something? It should only take a couple of minutes. I'll be right back. - You know her lines, right? - Yeah, inside and out. Look, if you leave, don't come back. All right, everybody, it's showtime. I need everybody in their places. Excuse me. I don't really think you know what you're doing. - I think he needs special care. - Yeah? I'll keep that in mind. I hope so. I'm erasing you from my life. What does that mean? - Nothing. - Where are we going? Where do you want to go? That's a funny question. You're always in control, so, I'll ask you again. Where do you want to go? It's your night, Nathan. - Any... where? - Yes, anywhere. I... I just want to go home. Take me home. Okay. I can do that. We're a family, right? Yeah, we're a family. You need a big brother to protect you, right? I have a big brother, but I can take care of myself and you can take care of yourself, too. You know, I'm gonna ask you again and this time tell me what were you doing on top of that house? I was looking. I want to find the kingdom. This will solve everything with us and the social worker. I told you not to go through my stuff. I wasn't gonna keep it. I promise. In the kingdom, no one ever gets sick, or hurt, or ever feels scared. It's never cold, or too hot, and it never gets dark, so we can play there as much as we want without worrying. Sounds too good to be true, Nathan. No one ever feels lonely in the kingdom. We'll be happy there. It's perfect. Can I count on you to have your stuff all packed up before you go to bed? Are we going on a trip? Yeah. Are you happy? I will be. Yeah, me, too. You want some breakfast? Yeah. Hey, listen, there's some things we got to figure out today. Excuse me. Thanks. Hey, you want the usual? Laura. Laura, look at me. I said look at me. I need you to look at me. We'll make it. We're going to the Red Rocks together. That's where we are going to find the kingdom. Please. Nathan, open the door. I can't help you two if you don't open this door. I don't see a better alternative. We can find it... together. There are voices at times when I'm alone. I like thinking it's the wind. Nathan told me it was so quiet one night that he could hear the air whisper. I remember that night. It was much quieter. What are you doing? I want you to hear what the night and wind are up to. They're playing. Listen, Laura. All I could hear was my breathing coming back. Do you believe that angels exist? Look at me. This is very important. I need to know that you still believe angels exist. - I do. I believe angels exist. - Good. It's necessary for finding the kingdom. That's so sad. What happened? He is the guardian angel who once protected the kingdom. Before there was ever a kingdom, an Evil Condor reigned terror over these lands. The Evil Condor sought to align his blood with the world he conquered. and compelled the most beautiful angel to marry him. Astounded by the love he felt for his wife and unborn child, he considered ending his war. But the angel was afraid. She did not want her baby to be born into a world of hatred. So, she fell and gave birth to the Condor Angel, a creature with great strength of the virtuous likeness of an angel. She spread her wings over her newborn son and became a tree. The Evil Condor felt betrayed. He wanted revenge. And this baby just magically survived on its own? She broke his beak off to conceal his identity. His mother, this tree, stuck her roots into the Condor Angel and fed him. It was his pain to bear for being given a chance to live freely. This is wicked good, Nathan. Nine hundred years later, the Condor Angel fell in love with a native princess, Princess A'hioka. The chief, father to the princess, told the Condor Angel that his appearance had a purpose. He instructed the Condor Angel to guard what he then called... the kingdom. The princess and Condor Angel married and had a son, but the Evil Condor learned of the angel's family and promised to kill their son. There was a final fight between them. but the Evil Condor... was too strong. The angel fell... leaving his son defenseless with no one to stand in evils way. The Condor Angel's son had to escape and go into hiding. Now, the angel must find his son before the Evil Condor does. What happens if the Evil Condor finds the kid first? - Why would you say that? - Get off of me! - Why? - Get off of me! Nathan, stop. Damn it! Holy shit, Nathan! I keep the Evil Condor here. It's absolutely the most powerful monster anyone has ever faced. I don't know how long I can keep him locked away like this. I really believe Nathan's stories are metaphors. Each character represents the love, fight, hate, and struggles we've been through in our past. He's adopted these guys as his family. The Condor Angel is his adopted father and guardian angel. And the Condor Angel's son is his adopted little brother that he can watch over, the way he wishes he could have watched over me growing up. Let me out here. - Right here, right now. - Just wait. I need to find someplace to park. It's a desert with miles of parking. Stop! Well? This is awesome! Woo! Yeah! Yeah! Laura! Hurry! Bring my book! Come on! Come on! It's so beautiful. We must be at the gates to the kingdom. We have to explore. I am not wearing this. It's part of the costume. What did you make this out of again? Dumpster boxes and stuff. You'll have to catch me. Laura, wait up! What part of the world do you call this, Spirit Wing? It's very strange. Young Huntress, we have passed through the gates into a nameless world where hungry creatures have not enjoyed the taste of meat for a very long time. I'll take the first look over this ridge. Stay close. When we play pretend, I have him chase me sometimes hoping that I can get us lost, far enough away to forget all the bad stuff we have in common. I don't blame him for wanting to escape reality. Being numb, playing pretend, what's the difference as long as you can get away. Spirit Wing, this area is clear, but I fear that we may venture too far. The sun is growing weak and your powers will soon be swallowed by nightfall. We should venture just a little bit more, so we may expand our knowledge of these lands and share our findings with the kingdom. I'm thirsty. I think we should head back. Nonsense, Young Huntress. I will fetch you the bag and get you water. Laura! He escaped! Laura, help! He escaped! I'm not afraid of you. You must have heard us talking about the Condor Angel's son, but you'll never find him because I hid him from you. I hid him from you! Laura! Where are you? Laura, where are you? That's it. I'm just gonna let the social worker take you. Dumbass! You promised never to play like this. The social worker bitch said we have to stick together. Nathan! Where the hell are you? Nathan? Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Oh, my God! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Wake up! Wake up. Nathan! Nathan, please, just wake up! Nathan... Help over here! Someone, come on! Help! Someone help me! Someone, please... What the hell is going on in there? Hey, we hear you. - Hey! - Help... Help! Please, help! I think it's coming from over there. Over here! Hey how's he doing? Did he fall? - What happened? - I don't know. - He looks really bad. - Yep. Jesus Christ! How long has he been like this? I don't know maybe a couple minutes. - No visible head trauma. - Nathan. Nathan, wake up. There's no pulse. What? - Well, do something! - Okay... All right! Back... back up. All right. Lower his head. Nathan, wake up. Come on, Nathan. Just please, don't let him die. Please. There's nothing. Shit! Okay, Nathan, you can breathe, man. Come on! Wake up, man! - Nathan! - Just breathe, goddamn it! Breathe! Oh, my God. Nathan. Thank God. Let go! - Get off of me. - Nathan. It's just me. The Evil Condor tried to kill me. I know it was you who let him out. You want me dead. Nathan, stop with that shit. He needs to get to a hospital. I don't need to go to some stupid hospital. I'm fine. He was dead just a moment ago. I don't know what to tell you. Thanks. You okay? No goddamn sense. Yeah, I saw that, too. Oh, my God, Nathan! I have to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. It wouldn't have happened if you had left the Evil Condor alone and didn't help him escape. Bitch! Who am I to you? Because last time I checked, I'm all you got. - Honestly? - Yeah, honestly. You're a nobody. You're nothing. Your life is meaningless. I am not helping you. I'm done. We are done. Nathan! Nathan! I'm so tired of this shit. I'm gonna kick your ass. Hi, I am the guy from yesterday. What do you want? - What? - How you doing? Why? Your brother's missing. Really? My name is Jimmy. Laura. I heard you yelling Nathan last night from our camp. That's us right there. So, I thought I'd help you find him now. Why didn't you help me last night? Well, it was dark and you two are sort of weird. You know what? Forget I said that. No, you know, I'm just a crazy person. You... you should stay the hell away from me. Wait, are there tall rocks around here? What do you mean? We're surrounded by them. I need to find the tallest peak. Can you help me do that? I don't see an easy way up there. Nathan, get down from there. Come up here, Laura. No way. I won't climb down until you come up here. Shit! Come on. It m ust be nice to have the freedom to just run away and always have someone find you. I'm sorry about what I said to you last night. I didn't mean it. Your life has plenty of meaning. Whatever, that's fine. I believe the kingdom is over there. I see it. Let's go down and get it. The kingdom is not that easy to find. It's hidden, remember? Come on, Nathan. Hey, Nathan. You dropped a silver bird skull yesterday. If you come down, I'll show you where it is. Yeah? All right, come on. All right. So, wait a minute. He beat up your boyfriend? Yeah, I kicked his teeth in. Kicked his teeth in? I'd rather stay quiet in loud places, listen for things that matter. Let me get this straight, you pulled the fire alarm... Then I screamed, "You're all gonna die." And the social worker? Bitch! Yeah, she is a bitch. Well. that sounds like fun. Honestly, I'm afraid of what others may see in me, the awkwardness, the difficulty I have fitting in. He's a piece of me. And I am a piece of him. There is no salt on these eggs. We're roughing it. Where are your parents? We're adults, so don't ask. Yeah, don't ask. Okay, you're both out here to escape big expectations. I get it. The kingdom. Do you try to piece people together on a regular basis? Yeah, as often as possible. You two are fused together like rocks. Noel. He's been a cement truck driver almost his whole life. It's where he gets his unique outlook on life. Yeah. And dumbass here has a way out by going to college, but he'd rather continue building boats. Why? It's a good question, Nathan. Why does anybody do anything? Jimmy thinks he knows it all. I love what I do, Noel. And you're okay throwing your future away? You're not being fair to him, Noel. See, finally, I have a friend to stick up for me against you. Make that two friends. You're outnumbered, Noel. All right, lighten up, kids. I'm not all bark. Actually, I open up whenever Jimmy and I spend time together. Isn't that right? Kind of like therapy. Clear your mess, Jimmy. Hey, what were you studying at school? General Ed stuff, nothing really. It was psychology. He wants to be a mental mechanic. Nathan, I'm assuming you're not going to a hospital. I mean not that there's one anywhere near here. I'll be more careful next time. Good, cause your sister needs a big strong brother like you - to watch over her. - Whoa! That's a lot of responsibility. Yeah. Do you think you're up for the challenge, Nathan? I'll watch over you, woman. You can tell he's the protective type, too. A lot of love between you guys, a lot of history, too. You can see it. You two are lucky to have each other. All right. I got something for you here. There is a mine in the same direction that Nathan thinks his kingdom is in. You follow the highway. Up you make a right on this road here. If you... I mean, well, when you get through "Last Chance Pass", you'll see the tunnel. It's right there on your right. You can't miss it. Who knows? Maybe you'll find something on the other side, right? - We should go with them. - What? We're not gonna do this. I'm taking us back home. Laura, you promised you'd help me find the kingdom. All right. I got an idea. Before you guys leave, I want a group picture. What? I don't get any group photos out here. It's just me, man. Come on. Guys, it's called a group photo. You're supposed to be together. Jimmy. In, in, in. Come on. Okay. That'll work. Mm, smiles. Okay, we are going to the mine to find the kingdom now. There you go. That's nice. Thanks. Who knows? You may actually find whatever it is he's looking for. Nathan. Good luck. The map says to make a left. I'm turning right. When we find the kingdom, everything will be better. You and I will be happier. I promise. Are you sure you can keep that promise? I can. I will keep my promise. Fine. Yes! Atta girl! Okay, you have to go 39 miles until you hit this dirt road. Then what? You get us there, then I'll tell you. It's impossible not to wonder how my life would be if Nathan wasn't so dependent on me. It's just a simple question. What if? At times, I daydream of the possibilities of who he could have been in my life. And appreciate the vastness... He would have been that bright student, the popular kid, all eyes wanting to be like him. They are involved in gravitational pull... Hey... meet me outside. He would know what it feels like to have a crush, feel wanted, and want that person back. There are times I swear it's all an act. I hate him for everything he could have been in my life. And, yet... I envy him for finding a way to scrape by this far. Pull it to the side of the road. It's heavy! It's full of costumes. Yeah, costumes. Woah! Movie, baby. Argh! Oh! Must search for adventure! Yes! That's it. We must proceed on foot. I can't believe I'm going through with this. Hey, so let's check this place out. It looks like no one's lived here in a long time. Do you think our old place looks like this now? I remember it looking better. Got you. Nathan, you'll never catch me. What are you looking at? Nothing. Hey, there's another house back here. Let's check it out. Totally creepy. Hello. It's nice to meet you. What are you doing? It's their house. I'm being polite. Go in. You can't be serious. It's pitch-black in there. - We'll go together. - Wait. What if there's no way out? Noel said there is a way out. He could be lying. Jimmy and Noel probably befriend people, naive young people like us, and give us somewhere to drive all the way up here and go into this mine. We'll be trapped like dozens of others and then eventually die a slow and torturous death. What do you think traps them in there? A lot of things. Sick things. The couple that lived in that house had like 30 kids and convinced them to live and work in that mine. There's just this twisted society in there just waiting for us to come in. They plan to eat us. We need an adventure. Yeah, one that we'll never walk out of. Laura, I don't see anything. Shh! I hear some something. It's moving by the walls. Nathan, stay close. The master's coming so far. We must be quick and stick together for I fear there's no forgiving passage into the kingdom. The only way through is by getting past all these people. Okay, don't... don't eat them right away. Is anyone... are you hungry? But no. I see you two have dressed for the occasion, Marvelous. What is the occasion? We are celebrating the return of our master. He had been locked away, you see, but he's finally free and he will be making his appearance soon. He will be pleased to see that you two have joined in on the celebration, not to eat you, just to see you. Uh? Going down. When you meet my master just have him smell you. Ah, delicious. I... never mind. Go ahead, have fun at the party. Laura, give me your lamp. Go along with it. Go along with what? We need to find the way out of here. Let's just feel the room out. You guys are beautiful. All right, so now what's your plan? We have a friend here who can help. We can trust him. Nathan, we don't have friends! Especially, not in a cave! Just calm down. Look, he's just over there. Come on. I now admit this whole thing was a bad idea. I want to leave. Don't stop dancing. It'll cause suspicion. - Condor Angel. - Nathan. I didn't think you'd be daring enough to take this route. The Evil Condor knows you're here. I will help you escape. Not too soon. They'll catch us. We just need to find an opportunity. So, is it really you? Hello, Laura. I was your guardian angel when you were a little girl. It's nice to see you all grown up. - I've been following you both. - Are we near the kingdom? It exists just as you have imagined it in your book, but these ghouls aren't going to let you go until the master arrives to greet you. Condor Angel, we have to find a way out of here. Follow me. I am so bored of this dancing. Surround them! Get them, eat them, pick them limb from limb. Time to die. Laura. Our lamps, grab our lamps. Their master's here. Run! Nathan, run! Run! Find the kingdom before the Evil Condor finds you. Don't stop running! Hurry! I will meet you at the kingdom. Woo! Woo! Feels amazing. So, what now? You're lost for words, right? It's that amazing. It left you lost for words. It's nice to be in your kingdom, Nathan. You know, getting here was an adventure. And this place is almost impossible to find, so... I need to hear you say it. Just say it. "I found my kingdom, Laura." Just say it because that'll make everything better and we'll just be happier. And things will be perfect. It's wrong. It's all wrong. This is not it. If you don't claim it, then I will. This is my kingdom. I found my kingdom! I found my kingdom! Let's go. I am going back home. We need to keep looking. No. We don't. Nathan, keep pushing. Laura, turn the wheel towards the tree over there. Nice hat. Nice makeup. You look great. It's just something I picked up. How long have you been waiting here? I didn't think you were ever gonna show up. Meet me at the lake just past Tunnel Road. And you left your phone number. You think you're smooth. Maybe, little bit. I should get a reward just for showing up. What's up with the truck? We ran out of gas. I'm glad. Nathan, find the kingdom before the Evil Condor finds you. Son of God. I need to find the kingdom. The Condor Angel will be there soon. Nathan! Nathan. I'll be right back. Hey, Nathan, how you doing, man? We need to leave. Now! The Condor Angel said he was going to meet us there. Nathan... I'm going to use the restroom. I'll talk about it with you when I get out. Hey, Nathan, did you find the mine? Did you find what you were looking for? Get out of my way! Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him. I have to hurry, find the kingdom before the Evil Condor finds you. I'm close. Just keep going. I'm almost there. I have to hurry, I have to hurry! Sure know how to pick your friends. I want to help them. Yep, I know you do. Nathan. Is that where your kingdom is, Nathan? Over that mountain? Why don't you wait by the truck for a minute, all right? I mean he has already beat up one boyfriend, right? Nathan. What is the kingdom, really? Fill up the truck. - Hey. - Hey. You look good just as yourself. Maybe. What do you guys have planned today? Uhm... We were thinking about getting away from the heat and heading up to the mountain. You and Nathan should come with us. I'd actually really like to get some gas from your RV before you leave. Well, listen, there's mountains stacked on top of mountains up there. You know, no one really knows about the place. There's only one trail that leads up with an eyeshot of it, Mount Langley, the most gorgeous mountain you're ever going to see. Yeah, plus, we can all caravan up and share a campsite. There you go. It's just too far of a drive and at this point, I'd really just like to get some gas. But it's not that far. It's just a left on St. Peter's Road. You sure that road is going to lead us to the kingdom? You have to be sure. Yes, Nathan, it winds all the way up. Thanks, man. You're encouraging him again? We just went through a mine and almost got lost, stranded, and killed. I'm not driving up to some goddamn mountain now. You're an asshole. And you're an asshole, too. Hey, I'm just trying to help. What about me? Whoever is trying to help me? I'll answer that. Nobody. All right? This is just a game to all of you. Calm down. It's not about you right now, princess, okay? It's about him. He is my brother. He is my responsibility. And as soon as I get some gas, I am... I'm taking us home and forgetting you two ever existed. Nathan, get out of the truck! Oh shit! Oh shit! Heeey! How much gas did you put in it? Uh, I don't know. Hold on, hold on. I think I can pass from here. Nathan, pull over! Nathan, you can't find the kingdom on your own. Watch out! Truck is going too fast, we're gonna run out of road. Nathan, listen to me. You need me to help you find your kingdom. No matter what you think of me, I'll always be your little sister. And it's more important to me than anything. No, it's gone. Maybe hit the rocks fast. Stay out of my way! You are not helping! You have been planning on leaving without me? Is that it? The Condor Angel said we need to hurry. The Evil Condor is following us. And I can't let you keep me from finding my kingdom! We are wasting time. We need to leave now. All this has to stop. Laura, no. - This book has been keeping you sick. - Please stop. You need to be a responsible man. Please, Laura, please. - And stop creating all this make-believe bullshit. - No, no, no. What have you done? I'll tell you what's real. You and I, you ruined my life. I regret ever telling you about it. There is no kingdom, Nathan! I was nine years old and I made the whole thing up just to make you feel better when our dad ditched us. Grow up and start acting like a man, okay? No, no. No. What is it? It's nothing. It's nothing, Nathan! I'm just gonna live out the rest of my life without you because all of this is just how fucked up my life is! Come on. Time to go, Jimmy. I hate her! I wish she was never born. Your book! - Nathan, listen to me, man. - Leave me alone! She made it all up. Doesn't matter anymore. Nathan... you believe in fate, man? You know nothing happens by accident? See, I don't... I think we all have choices to make. It's kind of heavy. Beautiful, too. Listen, Nathan, Laura is here because she loves you. It's your kingdom, Nathan. Nobody else has to believe in it for it to be real but you, man. Did Jimmy and Noel say where they were going? I have been holding a lot of anger in me. And it's not fair that I let it out on you. Tell me the real reason why you're here and be honest. You know, the kingdom could be right on the other side of this forest. What do you say, Spirit Wing? I've received word that we are very close. Noel and Jimmy gave you that map? Today could be the day. We must travel north. Do I really have to wear this? Yeah, yeah, yeah! Put it on! - Hey, let's race. - Go for it! You must be the Condor Angel's mother. I'm Nathan. It's nice to meet you. Nathan is a great believer of the truth. I've never known a better judge of character. I'm always scared to wonder what he thinks of me. Assuming things can just go on like this. How far back do you remember things, like, with mom and dad? I remember the park. Mom brought us out for a picnic and dad brought a kite. Dad held the kite up. I ran behind him. Mom is running next to me. We all wanted the kite to fly up and then it finally flew up. I thought we were gonna run like that forever. I've never heard that story. Hey, Laura. Yeah? I remember something else. What's that? On your graduation, I pretended to be one of your friends sitting next to you, wearing what you were wearing and feeling what you were feeling. I was so happy. I thought of the dreams you had and they became mine, too. Mom clapped when she saw you. Please stop with all that, I am tired. I told mom that I wished I was like you. I wanted to be popular, have a lot of friends to tell my stories to, be in love. I wanted to be in love, like you, have a relationship. I mean I was so happy for you for having everything. It doesn't make any sense to do that. Nathan, how sick are you? Mom is dead. I never had any of that. Everything you imagined about me is a lie. Okay, look at me! I'm standing right in front of you. Why are you so angry? I am a lost girl! I don't have friends, no childhood I want to remember. My life is broken. And you're broken, too. I can help you fix it. I can help you find your kingdom. Oh, really? I have a... I have a kingdom? I have a kingdom? I have a kingdom? I have a fucking kingdom? Well, how about this? The day that you find your kingdom, I'll start looking for mine. We need to go home. Now. No. Come on, Nathan, we gotta find your kingdom. Sure it's right on the other side of this hill, so, let's go! Laura! Laura! I'd rather go hoping to help you fix things. Where are you? I'm not playing anymore. Laura! Don't leave me alone, Laura. Laura, please. Laura, please, don't leave me alone. Laura! Don't leave me alone, Laura. Laura, please! Laura, don't leave me! I'm not afraid of you! You can't keep me from my kingdom! I'm not afraid of you! You can't keep me from my kingdom! Ah! Ah! Stop! The angel doesn't run away when he's scared. He's not ready. Nathan, what's wrong with you? Nothing is wrong with me. You're different and I like that about you. Because no matter what happens, brothers and sisters stick together forever. You have to take care of me, too, because you're older. Ah! I'm not afraid of you. I'm not afraid of you! I create my doubts, my fears, and I can defeat you! Nathan! Where are you? Nathan! I'm sorry things were tough. As long as we find your kingdom... we'll never get hurt or sick or ever feel scared. It's never cold or too hot, and it never gets dark so we can play as much as we want without getting tired. No one gets lonely in the kingdom. We'll be happy here. It's perfect. Still sounds too good to be true. That must be Mount Langley. So now what? Hey. I'm glad that you found your kingdom, but I can't let you stay, you'll die out here. I made a decision. You can't take that away from me. Condor Angel! Condor Angel, we made it! Whooo! We made it! I'm glad that we made it. We are at the kingdom! This way! Whoa! Come on, Nathan! Nathan, you did it! Let's go! Alright, guys. Remember today that we're doing the ballroom box stuff. You guys are doing a great job. It's continuing four steps, you can step together, step together. Uh, nice room. I got your favorite. Happy 25th birthday! It's nice to see you, Laura. It's nice to see you, too. Here, open your present. "To the best big brother in the kingdom. Love, Laura." Pretty cool, huh? Bet you didn't think I had it in me. I miss you a lot. I miss you, too. You should come to my housewarming party. I didn't know you were having one. I still have some work to do around the room, but I'll send you an invitation soon. Where's your book? I don't need it anymore. Nathan... are you happy? I will be. Your kingdom will be different from mine, but I'll help you find your kingdom as long as you help me find mine, too. Okay. I now try to convince myself that I am capable of anything. I am boring in comparison to all the great characters we create. We're part of some epic journey put together by the imagination of a greater being. And for the first time in my life, I can let myself breathe. No longer be afraid. I'm the closest I have ever been to finding it now. And I have a fresh start. Thanks for coming to my housewarming party. It's great to be here with you. Drum roll! Jimmy, please, hand her the family photo.
