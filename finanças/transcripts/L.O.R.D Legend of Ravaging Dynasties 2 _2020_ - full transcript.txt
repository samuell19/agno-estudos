it is recommended to watch LORD Part 1 (2016) first You use the seed itself for battle. You are from Earth Nation. Who are you? Don't you see the 3 students in front of you? Zillah. You are the former Duke I of Ashland. What should you know meaning to have 3 students. Then you must know as a Duke I, enter the territory Other nations could be considered a declaration of war. Hey! According to your description The intruder was definitely an Earth-Source Duke. Looks like they know we hide the Golden Eye in the Utool Ruins. Their invasion started sooner than expected. Hence our plan also have to start moving forward. Teresa. / Dark. In the following days there are 2 tasks that you must complete. Maybe ... I'll just wait at the door. Your mansion is really clean. But I... I just go back to the post and wait for Silver. Otherwise, he won't be able to see me when he comes back. Can you lend me money to rent a room? I've prepared everything in that post. Don't worry. But... You do need a clean bath. Your smell is really bad. Take off the dirty clothes and give it to me. This is a gift from Silver. I can't give it. Nobody wants your ugly clothes. Follow me. What do you think Silver left me? Will he still come back to me? Go on, don't worry about me. I'll stay here waiting for your return. Let me go! Where do you want to take me? Let go! Just kill me if you dare! You think I don't want to kill you? Be careful, the crystals are poisonous. Chiling! Chiling! Youhua! Hide! Silver, the end you came back to me. I'm here to find you. Why me? I am not your student. Silver and I will save Gilgamesh. We need your eternal strength to create large quantities of blood. So that's why Dark was trying to kidnap me. You two are looking to die, can you leave me alone? What does saving Gilgamesh have to do with me? I'm not going anywhere. This is your father's last wish, Duke VI Hillure. Don't talk about my father. He gave his Soul Stream to you at his death, not me. Then you have to make his wish come true. Don't you already have the Eternal Life Science? If blood is what you need, then make your own blood. I'll come with you. I want to help. I forbid you to go. Why? Silver, are you leaving me again? I will save my Duke. This has nothing to do with you. - Of course there is a connection. You must follow your Duke I also have to follow my Duke. / I told you! Does not mean still not. / Youhua can go why can't i? I can protect you. You alone can't beat a few magical weapons in battle. How can you protect me? Are you angry? Do you know what Silver and Kuizan Lotus are chasing after? I know. Save Gilgamesh or ... - I don't care about Gilgamesh. I care about Silver. He is my Duke. I will follow wherever he goes. If he goes on a suicide mission will you follow him too? Silver doesn't want you to leave because he intends to protect you. Why don't you understand too? I really understand. That's why I can't let him risk his life alone. I want to protect him. You can't protect yourself how can you protect him? I know. In your eyes I am only a student but I still want to be a useful person. Is it facing the sword for her sake or kill Magical Beasts, as long as I can fight with him I am ready to face anything. Why are you so stubborn? Youhua maybe no one is completely important in your heart. But later when you meet someone who is very important to you You will understand how I feel. Maybe your attitude is too harsh. I don't want him to die because of me. He is still too young. He deserves a better future. What future? You really believe Chiling should go without us? Your loyalty to Gilgamesh is Chiling's loyalty to you. I can go with you but on one condition. Convey. Chiling has to come with me. Chiling, get out. So what did that look mean ... He agreed. But I'll be clear first. Obey all my commands. Do not act without my permission. Dont worry. Your target I attack, I promise. Just treat me like your own Magical Animal. Your clothes are ... Oh yes, I thought so too. This shirt is too simple compared to the clothes you gave me. I don't want to wear it. Just blame Youhua. ... looks pretty good. Ha, that's right. By the way, Silver, Youhua's mansion has a large hot spring bath. Are you going to take a shower? After taking a shower you smell good. Here, kiss it. How does it smell? Don't you smell? Lotus, why don't you take a shower too? Oh come on, you think too much. Nobody will say you showered with Silver. I mean, at least you agree with my opinion. It depends on Silver's wish. Maybe you are right. Don't take him. Hey, seriously! You hurt my feelings, you know. You guys talk I go first. Bye! Are you leaving or not? I didn't eavesdrop, you know. I already left. We got caught. The Pastor will continue to hunt us down. We have to find another safe place to avoid being pursued while continuing our practice and preparation. Easy to speak rather than act. Beyond this door Pastor Messengers are everywhere from Ryen City to the whole of the Kingdom of Ashland. Wherever you go cannot escape their surveillance. If so we must leave tonight. / Huh? Where? Out of town. Pastor You're asking me to Hell's Aisle to find the corpse of this boy. I've brought the body back. If you still need ... Not. You can go. Good. Jiang Zhi... Each pernama month, Bless enters her own reproductive cycle which means that's when his strength is at its weakest. This is the perfect time to attack. To prevent us from saving Gilgamesh The priest will remove all chess piece portals which leads to the Chain Country. To enter Bukit Jiwa we have to venture by sea. Bukit Jiwa is in the deepest ocean. We cannot reach the Hill of the Soul with our current capabilities. We have to find SeaSilver first and make use of its strength. Who is SeaSilver? SeaSilver is a giant magical beast resting in the depths of the sea. Once belonged to my brother, Kuizan Feng When, but when he died SeaSilver disappeared into the ocean. When you are in Bukit Jiwa we must quickly break through 3 layers of defense. First layer none other than Bless, one of the Four Great Magical Beasts. I can hypnotize Bless but with a very limited time. We have to jump vertically from a height to be able to break through quickly. Therefore we must practice resistance to the speed and pressure of plunging from a height. When we make it through Bless we will advance to the Altar of Blood in the center of the ruins. Inotising Bles will drain my magical power. Youhua had to use his Ancient Life Sciences to replace me and it needs to create blood to activate next layer level door. So before we leave we have to strengthen Youhua's Ancient Life Sciences. We don't know how much blood it will take to activate the Blood Altar but a Reverend's second tier defense being certainly not that easy. And the gates of White Hell, that's the last level need to sacrifice invisibility weapons. The statue at the gate is a countdown device that consumes relentless Magical Weapons. To keep the gates open we need a large number of magical weapons. These are the 9 Dukes and Disciples in my family lineage. His Supernatural Weapons are buried with them and is buried here. Pastor using my magical power to the full my magical detection distance can cover an entire city but that's the limit. Right now those 4 people can be anywhere in the Ashland Kingdom. That is why with the help of Duke VI You have to activate the Soul-Catching Matrix to generate the ultimate search. Duke VI Hillard is dead. The new Duke VI, Frost. Duke VI's Science is a Soul-Catching Eye. When he caught someone's gaze he can see through the eyes and know the person's feelings. Zillah you will teleport the Messengers to the highest point of the Ashland Kingdom. Frost will use his Knowledge to connect the views of the Messengers and forming the ultimate observation network. The activation of the Soul-Catching Matrix required a large amount of Magical Powers. Zillah You will transfer the pure magical power of the Golden Lake from the Capital Glanort to Teresa and Frost. Then Teresa, you can immediately use Frost's gaze. With a combination of 2 Ilmumu You can control the eyes of all messengers. It can expand your magical detection range throughout this Kingdom to form the Soul-Catching Matrix. Are you sure you want to do this? Tenso Youhua's soul flow is not completely intact. It will be difficult for him to produce a lot of blood needed to activate the Blood Altar. But he already had a Soul Stream. You can't give him a new Soul Protector, you can only ... I can only merge our Soul Streams together. That was the only way to strengthen his Knowledge. But when all of the Soul Streams merged if he dies ... I'm dead too. I know. I promised Hillure to keep Tenso Youhua. Maybe this is my destiny. Does this match? He's younger than me. The world still has full hopes for him. He's got a people to think about, and his youth and his future whereas this world has nothing to do with me after I fulfilled my brother's last wish. I hope Tenso Youhua can live on for both of us. They are smart too. Still hiding in Tenso Youhua's mansion. Now we can ... - No need! You can all back off. Are you sure you did this? Not. But this is better than waiting to die. This could be our final bargaining chip. It has been years since the Bloody Massacre, and it is starting to repeat itself. Can you smell blood in a storm? I do not understand. Why don't they kill us in our dreams? But either way we've been caught. Youhua's residence is no longer safe. We have to leave early to find SeaSilver. Ice Fang! Hurry, go! Come on! Are we being tracked? How do they know our location for sure? It's weird too. Youhua! Looks dark. They are inside his body SeaSilver. I could no longer find their location through Lotus's eyes. Prepare to land. Lotus! Holdfast! Come on. What about Lotus? Silver! Chiling, let's go. We can't help Lotus. At least We can confirm it's Silver not alone in Rerunruhan Utool. Zillah, immediately go with Teresa to the Chain State. Each of you will maintain a separate level. You must prevent them from reaching Gilgamesh. Yes, Pastor. Teresa, have any questions? Why don't we keep the first tier together? Wouldn't separating our powers make us vulnerable? This is all part of my plan. No need to ask again. Yes. Pastor I can't promise to be able to complete this task alone. Of course. You will get help. Bless! This is Utool Ruins But I remember ... Utool ruins turned into a labyrinth. Maze? Maybe we can pass from above. There's no time. Come on, let's get through. There is no way out. Wind? What is your magic weapon from the Nation of Wind? Chiling, I will channel my magic power to you now. Get rid of those clouds as best you can. You can? I will try. Youhua! Ice Fang! Over there. What... do we need to fill this pool? What? You think I can't? Youhua! I'm fine. Hurry up! Are you okay? / Shut up! At this point I can still stand it. If you keep talking I might pass out. Hurry, go! Youhua, be careful. Youhua, wait for me. Chiling if I don't come back in time drain your magical weapon, You have to come back look for Youhua and Lotus and leave this place. Silver So can I ... - No. You are prohibited from entering the gate. If you come in looking for me I will not forgive you. You might think I'm a great person but the truth is I lead a very bad life. Still available 2 things in life that give me pride. First be his disciple of Gilgamesh. Second to be your Duke. This is one of my Magic Weapons. Scorpions live in it. He will protect you. Silver I will wait here. Silver! What a beautiful view. You like sweetness The smell of blood too, right? I remind you! Stay away! If you come closer I will ... will ... Aahh! Forgive me. What did you say earlier? What will you do if I get closer? Dark. Do not turn away! Don't look him in the eye. Teresa! Teresa! Who hurt you? - Run, it's a trap. What trap? Run! Kill them. Reverend White has already started the New Duke's plan. It's not just Silver and Lotus that are in danger. We are all targets. Here is the grave prepared for all of us. We can't escape. He already caught my eye. It's no use. His magic power is greater than yours. The ghost mirror had no effect on him no shadow. His magic power was much stronger. You're no match for him. Dark, you have to kill Dusk. Killing him will free the Quizan Lotus from his control. Just leave this to me. How about you? / Get out! Or we both will die. Chiling, I'm waiting for your return. Silver! Zillah, we have been lied to. The Pastor plans to replace all the current Duke Ashland. Their mission not killing Lotus or Silver. Their mission is to kill us all. Teresa had seen the Forbidden Fengshui Writing. He and Dark know the secret of Goa Jiangzhi. They will be a potential threat. At the same time, Ashland needed a Knowledgeable Duke with evolutionary potential to defend against foreign invaders. Zillah, you have to carry out This Duke Replacement Plan itself. Teresa! Teresa! Teresa! Teresa! Teresa! Dark. Dark. Zillah. Zillah! What are you doing? Zillah, Aren't you Silver's friend? Friend? Do you really believe in the term friendship? You must still believe in unwavering loyalty between Duke and Disciple. Didn't Silver tell you relationship between Duke and Disciple never equal? Your trust and obedience to Silver Your respect for him, your loyalty. A Duke never feels the same way towards his Disciple. You are wrong. Silver won't lie to me. You see? Silver is willing to sacrifice his life for Gilgamesh, like you risked your life to follow him here. But when you face danger like now... Where is he? If he had to choose between Gilgamesh's life or your life, guess who he will choose? It's up to you what you say. I will not trust you. I only believe in Silver. I envy you. I envy how simple your life is. Or rather how stupid. As long as I'm alive I'm not gonna let anyone in and harm Silver. Have you forgotten what my knowledge is? If I want to enter I don't need to get past you. But from the start I never intended to enter because it was impossible for Silver to eliminate Gilgamesh's last prison curse. Curse? I manipulate space in White Hell in order to slow down time 120 times. Your invisibility weapon maybe can last 100 days outside your body but the Silver Weapon won't last for a day inside of him. And that is clear why am I the only irreplaceable Duke during the time of the destruction of the old Duke. Bless and Blood Altar it's just a joke. The prison is indeed Gilgamesh it was created by my unique Science. Time's up. You haven't given up yet, have you? Silver! No ... Silver! Not! Silver! Silver! Not! Silver! Let's go before they come back. Teresa, Teresa, it's no use. What do you mean? Zillah has transformed this space into an endless one-way rotation. This space has become an inevitable confinement. Youhua! Do not approach! / Do not enter! If I don't come in Chiling and the others will get caught. Let me go in. My magic power is stronger let me. Do not. You have to save your magical power. Wait for Chiling and the others to come out. and take them away from here safely. Youhua. Dark help me. Please. There's not much left, anyway. I'll give it all to you. Why is my magic power ... fade away? Pastor, I can't promise to finish this task alone. Of course. You will get help. They... Duke I Dezang and his 3 disciples Heaven, Earth, and Sea. Their knowledge is Suction. They could drain Magical Power on a large scale. To them, Duke and Disciple who are without Magical Power nothing more than just a human. Youhua maybe no one is completely important in your heart. But later when you meet someone who is really important to you You will understand how I feel. Through cold ice or distant fire no matter where I just want to be by his side. We can fight together share the pain with each other even go to Hell together. Past the danger or suffering even on my last breath even when my blood is only a drop I can feel satisfied if I can protect him. You don't want to see him suffer do not want him to feel the slightest pain. Even though you were on fire even though your bones are crushed you are willing to give everything sacrifice everything even your own life. If it's all in vain at least run to him with all your strength. Although frozen to death awaits you nothing can stop you to keep moving forward. Silver, when can I get stronger? When you became a Duke. Am I going to be like you? Has my hair also turned silver? Maybe. You like? / Yes. I've always liked my appearance. So when am I going to become a Duke? When I die you will become a Duke. Don't do that. I prefer to be your student only. Black hair is great too. Silver come back! I don't want to be a Duke! You can take your Duke's title again. Aahhh! Pastor I have finished the task you gave me. So let's enjoy the perfect ending of our Cold-Blooded Supper. Kuizan Lotus and His Soul Flow Tenzo Youhua has merged together. They are currently in a symbiotic relationship. Interesting ... Save this type of Soul Flow for now. Bring them both back to the heart. Kill Teresa and Dark then you can come back. Pastor I know the secret behind Forbidden Fengshui Writing. Your mass production of clones with this Jiangzhi and wear them for the forbidden Soul Stream trials. Then you imprison them in a rotten cave without eating and drinking and let them die and eat each other like insects. From these you choose the strongest survivors. I'm in the process of preparing my plan when Dark and I died Jiangzhi secret and Rotten Cave will be notified on Wind, Fire and Earth. I am sure These three nations will not let you interfere at will balance of Soul Magic. Immediately after that these three nations will invade Ashland. Are you sure is that the result you want? Silver! You're not Silver. Who are you? Looks like his Invisibility Weapon is something special. I'll stay here waiting for your return. I'll be waiting for you here. Chiling! Chiling! Silver! Silver! Get off me Ice Fang! Silver! Silver! Silver! Silver, you don't die for strength. like I wasn't born for magical weapons. In a world you see cold and empty there are people who are full of enthusiasm like Lotus and Youhua, who are fighting to form their own destiny. I was before I'm weak, scared and not good at it. Meet you all show me a new way of life to defend the one I love to fight for what I want and never give up. You said in the face of despair even the smallest glimmer of hope has endless possibilities. Silver, I know you'll always be with me. So don't worry about me. I'll be right here. I'm always here. I will be waiting for you. It finally arrived. The final battle. Gilgamesh the invincible king will soon bring destruction to the gods in the way of his vengeance. At least I'm with you. We have got the Golden Eye of the Water Nation. Ashland will soon collapse and will turn into hell like the Nation of Fire. Then our next target is ... The Wind Nation. TO BE CONTINUED
