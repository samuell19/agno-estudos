[thunder] [coughing] [heavy breathing] [gasping] [trembling breath] (woman) Un. Deux. Trois. Quatre. Cinq. Six. Sept. Huit. Neuf. Dix. Camille, Emma! En place! [chatter] [whispers] Please God, let him be the right one. Please God, let him be the right one. [distant laughter] [gasps] [priest speaking Latin] [chatter] [church bell ringing] [man singing in French] [all singing in French] [applause] [chatter] [glass tapping] [clears throat] Emma... when your dear mother died, I cried-. I didn't know how to raise a little girl. A pig? Yes. [laughter] But you, with all those ideas in your head, I could not. Charles, you are a good man. And a good doctor. Emma's mother can finally rest knowing I married her well. This was your mother's favorite wedding gift. Please think of us when you eat your sweets. Santé. (crowd) santé! [applause] [cheering] [bell ringing] (Charles) This is Henriette. (Henriette) Madame. Would you mind helping us with some of these things? Of course. Let me, Madame. (Emma) Thank you. What's the matter dear? It': all part of nature. I need to remove my dress. Oh. I cannot remove it alone. Sorry. [bed creaking] [grunting] Sleep, dear. I didn't want to wake you. Stay with me. [chuckles] It is the patient that must find solace in the bed, never the doctor. But all doctors are husbands, too, aren't they'? Only in the evenings, dear. Enjoy your day. [door closes] [clock chiming] They're beautiful, Madame. Thank you. Are those for eating? Of course. You must have spent all afternoon on this. You shouldn't go to such trouble. Henriette is always quick to pick fruit from the orchard-. Is that what you would prefer? It is simply custom. Fruit, please. Any patients of note today? Any curious ailments? Curious? In the morning. A patient needed to be bled. On another, I applied leeches. His wife prepared me a delicious mushroom omelet for lunch. Oh, then yes, in the afternoon, a patient had something quite inexplicable. I examined his chamber pot twice, but it remains a mystery. Madame? Monsieur Lheureux is hereto see you. [approaching footsteps] Oh, just as everyone said, simply beautiful. That's most kind of you, but I must apologize. It's not proper for me lo receive you with my hair in such disarray. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Forgive me for making haste-. I could not simply let the day go by without gaining your confidence. I was told you were an elegant woman of taste, and well, I am a man in the service of such women. Whatever you command, I will provide you with. I visit Rouen at least twice a week. You do? Yes, I'm connected lo all the best houses, 'Tram Fréres“, 'La Barben", 'Le Grand Sauvage'. Anything you wish. Romantic novels, chocolates, candies. Look at this. Simply beautiful, is it not? Yes, it is. Mm. How many would you like? Oh, I'm afraid I can'1. I've only just arrived. Oh, and this, this, this, this is... made of pearl. Carved in open work by convicts in the West Indies. They are lovely. Mm. Oh, but ifs too soon. I want to show you something. My father's wedding gift-. Oh. Simply beautiful. We have so much to share. These, however, you must have. These are woven in Algeria but the silk, I don't know, is of mythical quality. Touch one, touch one. Ah. You have exquisite taste. Thank you. Angel. [chuckle] Look closer. Look at these spangles. Almost threads of gold. They scintillate like stars in the night, do they not? How much? A mere nothing. It's lovely, really, but it's too soon. I haven't even spoken of these matters with Charles. Ah, very well, very well. I understand. I will leave you some fashion journals and a book of fabrics. You really mustn't worry about the money-. I can give you some, if need be. On credit, of course. I know Charles is good for it. On credit? Yes. it means you can pay me whenever you like. Now... This. Beautiful, no? Mm-. [chatter] Ah. Maison Lheureux. He runs the boutique out of his own house. That is the end of the village. Come. Oh, I should introduce you to Homais. He's our local chemist. We work closely together. (Homais) For this month, hmm? Ah, Emma. You've joined us at last. You're beautiful. Ah. Welcome to Yonville. My dear, Monsieur Homais, and Monsieur Binet, our tax collector. And Monsieur Leon Dupuis, our legal clerk. Madame no doubt has had little time to rest since her journey. Well, moving about amuses me. I find ii tedious to always stay in the same place. I couldn't agree more. Not me. I'm most content with the same slippers and same fireplace every night. Charles, nothing is more pleasant than traveling. You wouldn't say that if you were constantly obliged to be in the saddle. You're wrong. I would talk of nothing else. Just last year I was in Switzerland. You can't imagine the enormity of the valleys, or the poetry of the lakes. It moved me lo such enthusiasm. I was... (Homais) Emma, you mustn'1 mistake Leon's profession for his heart. He might appear to be just a legal clerk, but secretly inside he's the last romantic left in all of France. [laughing] Oh, no, no. It's no laughing matter. I'm quite concerned, actually-. The other day. I heard him singing “The Guardian Angel' in his bedroom, and he was really giving it his all. There's nothing that elevates my soul more than music. (Homais) Oh, not you too, Emma. I need you to be sensible-. I have a favor lo ask you, actually. Of me'? Mm. I'd like to show you something in the kitchen-. Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us? (Charles) Monsieur Binel, could I trouble you for the bread? Hippolyte, here, works at the inn day and night busing tables-. And he does all this with an atrocious impediment. Mm that right, Hippolyte? Show Madame your foot-. See? It's gruesome, is it not? I'm sorry. Hmm. Now Emma, as a partisan of progress, it is my duty to keep this town to the fore. Which is why I need your help to convince Charles to operate on this poor man. I believe I should be convinced first, sir. It': for your own sake. Well. Madame, what do you say? I'm afraid it's not my place to tell Charles. No. No, forget convention and modality. There are no risks here, only advantages. Success. Certain relief. Beautification of the patient- But no less important, celebrity to be gained by the surgeon. All of what you speak of is most alluring. But the decision is not mine. It's up to Charles. [chuckles] Oh, very well. But you will at least help me convince him, will you not? We'll see. [chuckles] Excellent. I haven't devoted much time lo the garden. It could be so beautiful. I'll take care of it. You've never thought of a fish pond, perhaps over here? You'll have plenty of time lo do as you wish. Best to come inside. Surely, ifs for you to enjoy as well. Well, yes. But not so early, and not in this cold. (Charles) Okay, one more. This should be the wars! of it. Yeah. Yeah, ifs coming off. [stops playing] That's most of it done. There, there. I think you're good to cover up now. [playing continues] (Charles) No, but that is once you've done the operation. The diagrams. The diagrams are very detailed. (Homais) Yes, well, you've never seen anything like them, I'm sure. They use a hand here. (Homais) Now, we must all understand the future importance of this machine. This here is a symbol of industry. It is a feat of engineering. Notice the treadmill gives a perfect regularity of motion to the horse. Here we go, here we go. (Charles) But this configuration seems extremely uncomfortable for the horse. When does the animal rest? They should have two horses taking turns or some form of schedule. Well, I suppose every town has its diversions. Is this ours? Well, it isn't Paris. Have you been? I have. It's even better than you can imagine-. It alights your every sense-. Nothing at all like Yonville. I apologize. I shouldn't speak that way-. You've only just arrived, and well..-... to be honest, there's nothing to feed my soul here but my very own mind. I feel guilty saying that- No, don't. Guilt will bring you nothing, I swear. When I was sent to the convent for my education, I had a beautiful idea of the piety of those pale-faced women with their rosaries and their convictions. I wanted to be just as they are, but I couldn't. I puzzled myself to find some vow to fulfill. At confession I even invented little sins. [laughs] No. I was mortified. I wanted only emotions, not discipline. The good nuns declared me Hm. To he without calling and cast me out to read romance novels and fulfill the desires of the heart. They made me ill, but it was only later that I realized that my guilt had been keeping me from the happiness I deserved. And have you found that happiness here? [clock ticking] [door opens and closes] Forgive me. I did not hear you enter-. Charles is visiting a patient. I'm not here lo see Charles. No? Of how may I be of service? Of no service. I hoped you might accompany me on a walk. A walk? It': a lovely day. I have a gift for you. I can't accept. It's a triﬂe. A relic from my days in Paris. Take it- When I was a child, I had a map like this. Every night, I would close my eyes and trace down the boulevards and over the bridges, imagining myself in a carriage passing all the busy people. All of them with someplace to be. Hm. [chatter] [priest speaking Latin] Foo. Well, that's all I've gal. [laughing] [chuckles] I win again. I'm going to bed. Do you mind if we play another? No. Please. By all means. Good night. Good night, Charles. Came with me. Please. I need to talk to you. [footsteps] Come. I fear I might be going mad-. I think of nothing but you. I cannot even hear my voice in my own head. I only hear yours-. I'm married. Tell me you feel differently-. [raining] Parents. Now go back there, sit dawn, and stop messing about. Charlotte, will you sit up straight!? Now, all of you... The young scamps. They respect nothing. You lock pleasant, Madame Bovary. I don't feel pleasant, Monsieur L'Abbé. Nor do I. Might be what I ate. Or maybe ifs the season. Cold days weaken one most remarkably, don't they? I suppose. Yeah. As Saint Paul says, we are born to suffer. I've known poor young mothers, virtuous women. of course. Veritable saints, who did not have enough bread. What of those, Monsieur L'Abbé, those who have bread, but don't have any... Fire in winter? Oh. Does that matter? Does it matter? Seems to me that once you have a good fire, sufficient food, and a good husband... Bonnie“. I'll warm your ears for you, you imp! [giggling] Talking of which, how is Monsieur Bovary'? Well, that is what I, what I came 10 talk lo you about. Sick as well. Too much work. We two are the busiest men in the parish. I, the doctor of the soul, he of the body. Oh, you're most unwell. You should get home. The first communion will soon be upon us, and I must make these devils pious. And I told you all to stay still and be quiet. Now, look at me. Did you know Leon was moving to Rouen? Homais told me this afternoon. He didn't give much notice. Homais was quite upset. He needs to find a new tenant. Did he say when? Tomorrow or the day after. I never noticed Leon had such an impulsive nature before. (Henriette) Shall I tell the master? No, don't. It'll only worry him. It': just my nerves. This shall pass, Madame. You'll come to like it here. I imagined that this would be the happiest time in my life, but the calm here in which we live is not what I dreamt of. One after another, the days come, always the same, bringing nothing. Is this the will of God? Is my future just a dark corridor with a bolted door at the end? Always in a book. dear. You'll strain your eyes. This book is fascinating. Ifs about the Orient. Their manner of dress, the rituals, even their medicine. I could read it to you. You might find ii of use. Those are only curiosities. They have no application in Yonville. But we certainly won't be spending the rest of our lives here. I would hate lo disappoint you, my dear, but I don't see us going to the Orient-. Well, I know that, Charles. I was thinking Paris or maybe Rouen. Do you really believe a country doctor can open a practice in Ruuen on a whim? It's... But you're not a country doctor. Very good, Madame. Tighter? [door opens and closes] [chatter] (D'Andervilliers) My man is opening a practice in Rouen, so we are currently without a doctor at Vaubeyssard. (Charles) Ah, yes. Madame Bovary, I suppose? You are blessed, my dear Doctor. (Charles) Ah. It's most certainly broken-. Emma, dear, would you mind telling Henriette to warm some water? Okay. I was going to ask, are you on duty Sunday, Doctor? No, Monsieur Le Marquis. I always spend Sundays with my wife. That wouldn't be a problem. We would, of course invite Madame Bovary to come along. I'm hosting a hunt next Sunday, and we need a doctor on premises. So, can I count you in'? Well... Would Madame ride with us'? A hunt, you say? (Charles) Sunday... Well. I see no reason why not. Fantastic. I look forward to it. Madame Bovary. It's so good to see you. Beautiful as ever, of course. Charles and I were treated with the most extraordinary invitation. Oh? The Marquis D'Andervilliers invited us to a Chasse à Courre. And you don't have a tenue d'amazone, I suppose? This is going to be very expensive. You will extend me credit, will you not? Money should never be the problem, only the solution. [dogs barking] My dear doctor. Please forgive us for taking Madame Bovary along. I leave you in excellent company. By all means, Monsieur le Marquis, enjoy the hunt. Emma could do with the fresh air and exercise. As for me, a day not in the saddle is a day of bliss. I'm much happier here with the buffet. My dear friends! What good fortune it is to share this moment with all of you today. I cannot fully grasp the reason for my euphoria this morning. Hunting is part of my life and my soul. Who could live more fully, love more deeply, or celebrate so well as the hunter with his horse and his hounds. hm? So now, my dear friends, on your saddles. [shouting and barking] [hunter shouting] [sword swishes] [animal cries out] [mud] [chatter] [door knocking] (Charles) Come in. [door opens] Good morning, Monsieur. Good morning. Madame. What is it, Madame? You don't wear a uniform. No, Madame. I never have. Of course not- it's my fault. I've never bought you one-. I'm happy to wear my own clothes, Madame. Yes, but a uniform is a proper dress of someone of your profession. Go see Lheureux. He'll dress you appropriately. As you wish, Madame. What's that'? What's what? That box. Ah. It's a cigar case. I couldn't find an opportune moment to return it to the Marquis. You should save it until after you've operated on Hippolyte. I'll have this returned lo the Marquis. I've been thinking. What's there to think about, dear? We must progress. As Homais said, there are only benefits. No, there are risks. How do you think the Marquis' doctor opened a practice in Rouen'? He took risks. I would like all of these curtains changed. I want them to be made of gold damask with an embroidered print of some kind. I know just the look you want. I would also like new linens, and two silver candelabras. Silver? Well, surely gold is twice as much. Yes, but if you bought one large gold candelabra, it would fit the table better. It wouldn't cost much more than two silver ones. Hm. Hm. Anything else? There was one mare item. Well, don't hesitate. I saw a rug in... A rug. That's not drinking the sea. But what about the dresses? We'll get those too. Stop dithering. Take it, take it. Each moment you do not possess what you love is a moment not spent in love. And a heart without love is a heart without a voice. No song, no life. Do you like this for the fair? Doesn't feel loo austere, does it'? You look beautiful, Madame. You have such a figure. A spoonful of vinegar with every meal. After a week, you don't even taste it anymore. [chatter] Ah. Doctor. Madame. What a superb morning. Yes. Everybody is out. It's not too cold. [cow bellows] Ah, my goodness! What an amazing beast! Remarkable. [bell rings] Ah, ifs time for the awards. Well, I won't keep you from the ceremony. Pleasure seeing you both. Good day. Dear, would it bother you terribly if I ran home to rest? I'm feeling fatigued but I'd hate to miss this evenings festivities-. Are you unwell? No, just tired. Would you like me lo join you? No, no, dear. I know you enjoy this. [gasps] Your note worried me. Are you not feeling well? In all truth? I'm drifting into depression-. You? If only I'd found some love, I wouldn't have to act such turbulent joys or fling myself into such fantasies and follies. As a woman, I'm not permitted such distractions. Sad distractions. For happiness is nut found in it. (councilor) Gentlemen, may I be permitted first of all to pay tribute to the higher administration lathe government. For friends, it is my duty to pay tribute... Again, duty. H's always duty. I'm sick of that word. One's duty is to feel what is great, to cherish the beautiful, not accept the conventions of society. To some extent, one must how to the opinions of the world, and accept its moral code. But there are two codes. There's the eternal. The poetic, which is ours. And the other? Salt-convention. With all due respect, Monsieur le Marquis, we should put an end lo this discussion. Then I shall be something to you'? I can only offer you my friendship. How dare you'? You come here to offer me your friendship? [cheering] Madame Bovary. Charles forgot to return this. You didn't come here all the way through the woods to return a cigar case, did you'? Please. Well... I have been thinking. Really? And what have you been thinking about? Well. I realized that before getting married, I was contemplating my coming life like a child in a theater. Sitting there in high spirits, and eagerly waiting for the play to begin. It was a blessing in my early youth that I did not know what was really going to happen. When I look back now, it seems that I was like an innocent prisoner, condemned not to death but to life, and as yet unconscious of what the sentence meant. The longer I live, the more clearly I feel ma! on a whole... life is a disappointment. Oh, my dear. Perhaps you are simply in need of a confidante. A lady friend who could advise you in such feminine matters. Unfortunately, I'm not... I came here because I need you-. I will not remain standing inert in this fever of despair. My dear Emma. you are unrelentingly standing under an apple tree, wishing to smell the scent of orange blossoms-. So, yes, you are indeed standing inert. Lost in a world of illusions. You like to hear the words but you have no courage lo act upon your feelings. I do. I do have courage. Please, do not push me away-. Yes. Indeed. It took you a lot of courage just to come here, didn't it? [chatter] Madame'? Monsieur Homais. Woman) Oh, Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma. You are beautiful, you are wise, and you are magic. [laugh] I don't know how you've done it-. Oh, it's all Monsieur Lheureux. Monsieur Lheur... Ah. [laugh] Forgive me. I wasn't commenting on the house, which is indeed in exquisite taste. No, Charles has agreed to operate on Hippolyte's wretched foot. Yes. This hook contains everything he must know for the surgery. Do not let him rest until he has learned it all. You hear me'? Yes. Excellent. And very soon, you will be the wife of a famous country surgeon. What? This is what you want, is it not? Of course. Of course. Study hard, Charles! [gunshot] Do you love me? Of course I do. A great deal? Yes. And you haven't loved any others? You didn't think you'd got a virgin, did you? Of course not. But I love you so that I could not live without you. Don't you see'? [grunting] (Homais) Ladies and gentlemen of Yonville, you see before you your great doctor, Charles Bovary, who today will finally cure our poor crippled friend Hippolyte of his most ignominious of traits. You may come forward, but keep your calm. Remember... [Hippolyte screams] (Homais) Some more brandy. Come, come, come. Take a good slug of that- [slurping] Good boy. (Charles) Monsieur Dubuc, if you would hold the box. [whimpering] It must not move. We shall begin. Shh. [screaming] [crying] I know. I know. Shh. (Charles) Second incision. Shh. We're nearly done. We're nearly done. [crying] Despite the prejudices that still invest a part of Europe like a net, the light of hope begins to penetrate our country places. Thus it was on Tuesday, our little town of Yonville found itself the stage of a great surgical operation and loftiest act of philanthropy. Monsieur Bovary. our most distinguished practitioner, performed an operation on a club footed man. Moreover, that operation was performed as if by magic. And barely a few drops of blood appeared on the skin, as though to say that the rebellious tendon had at last... [door knocking] Given way beneath the endeavors of the surgical an. [door knocking] To progress. (all) To progress. (Madame Homais) Help. Help. I'm going mad. He won't stop screaming. All right. He thinks he's dying. Calm down. What's the matter with our ungrateful patient? He's having hideous convulsions. He struck the machine on his leg against the wall enough to break it. Yes. Go, Charles. You must ensure the success of the operation. (Homais) We'll return shortly. Well? I removed the box, but the swelling is much worse than I imagined-. Perhaps it was a vulgus. What? I may have cut the wrong tendon. I'm worried that if it does not heal properly and gangrene sets in, then we will have to amputate. My love. Don't touch me. What is it? This was not meant to be. You know how much I love you. Stop il. Calm down. You're not being yourself-Leave me alone. How can Charles be so complacent? He has no notion of my torment. If he'd even once just tried to understand me, I wouldn't have... He's the cause of my misery. I wish he would heat me, so I might have a reason to hate him. You're... you're here. Take me away. I beg you. Oh. [sigh] You can't do this. It's reckless. You're compromising yourself. You're married, Emma. We could be married. We could go live elsewhere. In Paris. [chuckles] You really are mad. How is that possible? Please. I thought I married a doctor, but he's not. He's a butcher. He tortures me. I can't stand another day of having to eat while peasants cough and recount their whole vile medical histories. [sighs] Have courage. Be patient. I have been patient. I've suffered long enough. You can't leave me like this. Very well. Give me sometime to arrange some affairs. You look beautiful. Henriette. will you please stop crying? Listen, you will take good care of Charles, won't you? You have to promise me. He is a good man. [door knocking] Thank you. [door closes] Who is it? A gift from Monsieur le Marquis. [crying] (Henriette) Monsieur Homais. (Homais) _ Forgive me, forgive me. I had to see for myself. A Plum'? No, no, no. I don't believe that. That': extraordinary. Yes. the irregularities of the nervous system can he perplexing. Well, you know. My friend Bridaux has a dog that goes into convulsions every time you hold a snuff box up to him. It's curious though, isn't it? . It's not. [whispers] You will wake Emma. Rest, dear. Rest. [door opens and closes] Here's the leg. This should certainly improve our friend's step-. The socket is lined with cork. It has spring joints but function aside, consider only the aesthetics. I did not order this. Oh, Madame Bovary ordered it. And it was not inexpensive. Three hundred francs. It's been over a month now and she did not leave a deposit, so I will require complete payment right away. Well, you may keep it. I can't. It's made to precise individual measurements. But I cannot pay you. Charles, you are obliged to-. Otherwise, I must exercise the law. I will give you until spring to pay, then I'll extend you an additional 500 francs on your loan to cover whatever costs incurred by Madame's... Illness. Illness. Fine. My dear Charles, I think I may have the cure for Madame. Emma, are you familiar with the great baritone Romeo Fidanza? Yes. of course. Well, what about him? Oh, my closest supplier, the owner of La Maison Trois Fréres, is holding a recital. I have a few invitations. Only for my best clients, of course. This is exactly what she needs. To wear a beautiful gown, to he herself, and take pleasure in what she loves. Emma, think of it. What a figure you'll out in that beautiful silk gown, hmm'? The one with the bow in the back. [singing] Emma, dear. You won't believe who is here. Leon. What a coincidence. Is this your first time in Rouen? I studied medicine here, but ifs Emma's first time. First time to a chamber recital? Yes. And? It was absolutely beautiful. What this must mean to you. So, tell us, Leon, how is life in Rouen? I've been working at a rather large office, getting excellent practice while I finish my studies. Have you found time to enjoy Rouen's cultural life? Oh, yes. I go to the opera quite often-. I've seen all the great tenors. Rubini, Grisi, Periani. I can't imagine. Rubini is performing tomorrow. He is sublime. You should come. Oh, unfortunately, I must be back in the morning. In all honesty, I never summoned the courage to go to the opera in the four years I spent here. I don't fully understand the purpose. Doesn't the music drown out all the words and make it impossible to... Charles. Do you wish to stay, my dear? We could meet at the cathedral. You must see it. (Charles) Think it aver, dear. Night brings counsel. (driver) Hippolyte! Give me a hand here. How do you feel with the boot? Just give me some coppers and I'll carry your bags. That one. Thanks. What is it? My father passed. Oh. [approaching footsteps] I just heard the news, and under the sad circumstances, I thought I'd come along and offer my services. Thank you, but we can do without. Are you sure? Yes. I beg your pardon, Madame, but I should like a word with you in private. It's about that affair. I have been very good to you, Emma. Weren't you glad to come across old acquaintances in Rouen? Don't you think your timing is a trifle inopportune? Your husband is a good fellow. Kind. Honorable. What do you want? Your debt has become quite formidable, but you know that well enough by now. This matter specifically relates to your little fancies in Rouen. His father is not yet buried, and you blackmail me? Well, I happen to know Charles has inherited a plot of land just outside the town with 14 acres, so... I could extend his credit. But in his slate... I think it better if he gave you power of attorney. That way, we, you and I... could continue our little business transactions. This one. This one. Not this one. [sighs] [approaching footsteps] [piano playing] Dear. you are wrong lo get so impatient. Ifs awful. My fingers have gone stiff. I know. Try again. It's no use. I can't get better without instruction. Don't say that. But ifs true. The only teachers are in Rouen. Well, if you must, take a lesson. Ah. How was your day? Good. I was admiring this magnificent new rug, Emma. Why, thank you. Has Henriette not served you yet? No. Oh, dear. You must be starving. I'll fetch dinner immediately. What is it. Charles? What has your friend gotten into your head? Homais? Nothing. Lheureux was looking for you today. He brought over a bill, and I opened it. Oh, dear. Why did you do that? I need you to knew that I do no! make, nor ever have made enough money to pay what is due. Please. dear. You upset yourself unnecessarily. Look around. Look at everything we have. The rugs, the new curtains, the chairs. Really, Charles, look at everything. You must confess that considering the quantity, the cost isn't too dear. Those are all extravagances! I could have done without them all! But you enjoy it. Do you not sit in your chair every day? But I didn't need it upholstered. Nor do I need silk lining in my jacket, or pistachio cream for my dessert or oysters! Not everybody can be rich, dear. September 2nd, 200 francs-. October 5th, 375 francs. November 20th. 450 francs. There's no end to this. You owe me 10,000 francs, and you must begin to pay. But I have nothing to pay you with. Oh, but you do. Charles' inheritance. If you could. What are you doing here? Why today? I had a horrible fight with Charles-. I'm working. I can't see you now. Come now. You can slip out with me. That's impossible. My master has already complained about my absences. This isn't like before. There's something I must discuss with you urgently. Please. It's of a legal nature. Very well. Wail for me outside. I want you to grow a pointed beard like the Duke of Normandy. What is the legal matter? Let's buy you a new suit today. All black. No. I don't want to. And more importantly, I can't afford one. How you care for your money. Yes, I do. Very much. Now, what is the legal matter you wanted to speak of Marriage. Marriage? Yes. You are married, Emma. Exactly. You are going lo leave me, too, aren't you? You will marry someone else. You'll be like all the others. Like what others? Emma, like what others? Like all men. Which men? You are all evil, every one of you. I cannot accompany you. Leon, please. I will meet you at the hotel tonight-. Please go. Leon. You must stop doing this. But you never came. I mus! speak to you. Do you know what you're doing to me? These visits? Every day I must reckon with my companions making jokes about me. You twit. You worry about your fellow clerks making jokes about you'? Do you no! love me'? Do you not love me? Leon! Leon! This is of absolute reproach. You are ruining yourself with a married woman. Dismiss her at once or you will be dismissed. Yes. She's just leaving, sir. [hammering] Who was that? What have you done? Who was that? The bailiff. No. No, no, that can't be. That's all wrong. Monsieur Lheureux, there's been some kind of mistake. A bailiff has just left my house with an order to collect everything within 14 days. Did you no! hear me'? [clears throat] A judgment and a restraint. Yes. You must fix this. I'm afraid I can't. I was pressed for capital and had to pass on your debts to a creditor in Rouen, a Monsieur Vingarl. But you made a promise. I was being bled myself. A knife was at my throat. You simply have too many bills. One gets in quite a muddle over them. But surely, good Monsieur Lheureux, you can talk lo Monsieur Vingart and quiet him. Quiet Vingart? You don't know him. He's more ferocious than a bear. You could try the Marquis. The Marquis? Yes, I hear he's back from his sojourn. Now, if you may, I must send these parcels out at once-. [approaching footsteps] Madame Bovary'? Are you here to pay alms'? No. Monsieur L'Abbé. To confess? No. To seek counsel? No. Just silence. Have you tried a walk in the forest? It never is absolutely quiet, bull believe one can find great silence in the sounds of nature. (bailiff) Good afternoon, Madame. Charming. Very pretty room. Ah, correspondence. Allow me. Must make sure you're not hiding any gold coins. Sir. Madame Bovary. You haven't changed a bit. You're still as charming as ever. They are poor charms since you disdained them. What do you want? I am ruined. I need 10,000 francs. Ten thousand francs? My husband borrowed against our home. We shall have the money soon, but today for want of just 10,000 francs, we are to be sold off. I do not have the money that you need. You don't? I'm struggling myself. I pity you very much. The least of these trifles could get you the money. You want for nothing. I don't have the money that you need. You made me believe that you loved me. For months, you held me in the sweetest dream. Do you remember your letter? It lore my heart, and still I come back lo implore you. But you just look through me and disdain me again? I do not have the money that you need. (Charles) What are you doing?

There's no way out. The court has made its judgment. Did you think, little lady, that I would be your supplier and your banker until the end of time just for the love of God? But the amount is far too much. And whose fault is that'? While I'm slaving away in here, you're gadding about. And I'm the one with the fickle heart? Not a sermon, please. It never does any harm. You are a wretch. Such a little hothead. I know it's not very pleasant. I'm aware of that. But it never killed anyone, did it? And it's the only way for you to pay me back-. But could you not lend me just a..-... None whatsoever. Mm-. [sighs] You have been an excellent patron. And I have done very well by you. But in this state I do not see value in this proposition. [clinking] Madame? Madame? [coughing] [gagging] [gasping] [grunting] (man) Madame Bovary! (Charles) Emma! Emma! (man) Madame Bovary! Emma! Emma! Emma!
