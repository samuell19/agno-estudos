You okay, Mrs. Crane? - Yes. - Can I get you anything? No. Would you like to take a break? Maybe relax a bit? Sometimes, I lock myself in the bathroom and I take a nice long, hot shower. That usually does it for me. Did you need a few more minutes? Yes. Would you like to go back upstairs? No. Yes. He was a good man. You need to understand this? It's okay, Marion. Don't patronize me! He was a good man. It was his business that had the issue. I am sorry. Is there something else you want to confess, my son? I am sorry. What do you want to say to me? I can't do it, it's a burden. Do you want me to clear the room so you can speak freely? I said no video. That was you. You said 57. What is 57, is that an address? I thought I blocked it out. I remember, everything that happened. Do you mean 1957? Yes, that's it, 57. Go head, and confess, my son. Speak freely. God is here listening to you. He is here to guide you. He will guide you through your pain. Confess to God. He will relieve you of your burden. Seven, 57. Dearest Thomas, I hope you understand why I've chosen to end my disintegrating life. I could not watch myself get any more hideous and I did not want you to see it, too. I hope when you're thinking of me, you see the beautiful woman that you married. You have been so wonderful. And I am grateful for the life that I had with you. I hope you were happy for me because as you read this, I'm no longer suffering. I love you. And one day, I will see you again. Harold, where have you been? You disappeared on me. I thought you died. I think I need to call Dr. Valmer, who's in tomorrow. Whatever bug you've been building up, I think I caught. Harold, have you even heard a single word I said? It's no wonder you can keep a goddamn job. You're lucky you can pay the $90 for this month's rent. Probably gonna have to ask father again, to help bail us out. You okay? You've been weird ever since Bogart died. I think I'm going to make tea. Maybe I'll heat up some corn beef hash, too. I understand. Uh ha, bye. Where have you been, mister? That darn phone has been ringing non-stop. I'm only two minutes late. Hello? So... Why do you think that I wouldn't be able to write our wedding vows? Where is this coming from? Well, I'm in the car, listening to the Jimmy Star Show, on the way over here. So they start discussing wedding vows. So I clearly thought back to the other night's dinner conversation where- The dinner that you were late for? Mister, I'm always on time. I'm always punctual. Mister, I'm always late when that phone is ringing. You know what else I'm gonna be late to? Our wedding. Not likely. Unless you want to be carried to the alter by two big gorillas. And Bobby will make sure that James and Charles are right there by your side on that day. So the gorillas are your two brothers? I'm sorry, I thought you were referring to your folks. Why, George Alfred Lazarus, you take that back! You take it back! Pick up that- Insurance. Yeah, this is he. Mother and father are not going to- You don't say? No, I don't see anything here. Your sister's a baboon. Hmm hmm. Hold, Bethany, you got a telegram this morning? No. Wait, Mr. George, wait. Hold on a second, here. Good morning, Benjamin! I'll call you back , give me a second. Yeah, got it, uh ha. Good morning, Ms. Bethany. - And how are you today? - Eh. Ah, look at this. Okay. Oh, I hope that's not your mother's blueberry pie that you got tucked in under your arm there. Oh no, I picked this up at the five and dime. It's a Frisbee. You play catch with it. Kind of like baseball, but it's with the saucer, instead. Well, why don't you just find a baseball? I kind of wanted to see how I like this first so I can send it to my little cousin for Christmas. Oh dear. Do you really think he's going to enjoy playing with a pie pan? Well, I don't know, I hope so. I spent all my money on a plane ticket to see the little brat, and my namesake, my Uncle Ben. I know, no rice jokes. I'm sure he's going to love it. Okay, thanks. Hey, good morning, Chip. All right, so that was Hitchcock over at Topaz Insurance. A company over in Studio City just filed a claim against some of their employees, stating that they had sabotaged his business with some unknown source. So the owner, he wants his claim adjusted and he wants the policy pay out so it can make up for the downtime. Well, that claim sounds like it's both birds, Mr. George. Hmm, yeah, well, Topaz agrees. So, they want us to dig, see what we find out. Well, how much is the claim for? Well, looking at 13 people on the claim from the company, lost wages, estimated, $13 million. I declare. Well, what company has that type of money to pay out, anyway? I don't know, it seems a little out there, like that woman who stole $40,000 to pay for her boyfriend's divorce. And then she gets caught and wants to return it. I tell ya, people. Geez, what a psycho. Why don't you tell us how you really feel, Chip? - Goodbye, Ms. Bethany. - Goodbye. Bye, George. Don't forget, we have dinner tonight at the Parks. And then afterwards, all watching you bet your life on television. That was tonight, wasn't it? No George, you did this to them last week. We are going and that is final. Uh ha. George, you promised. Hmm hmm, yeah. George stop, you promised! Oh, all right, all right! Until then though, I'm going down to the Valley. I've got to take a ride out there. I've got to sit down with Harry. I gotta get more details. Well, you need company? I'm almost done here. Nah, that's okay, love. I'll be back within the hour. Okay, Mister. You don't want me around? I get it. Hey. You know, you... You're my special flower. I wouldn't know what to do if you weren't in my life. You keep me honest. You keep me grounded. And you keep me humble. And these are some of the things that I truly love about you. You see? I could write my vows. Take me with you. I certainly will. And this... This is what you got me for my birthday last year. Man, I'm killing this vow stuff! Oh, what am I gonna do with you? Stated that Jackie Robinson will not be moving with the Brooklyn Dodgers when they relocate to Los Angeles... Hey Smitty, what do you say? Hey, George, the usual? Yes, with a Tribune. You like the fights, George. Hasn't been exciting to me since my Marciano retired last year. Big talker today, I see. Okay, one A cream. Ed Gein, is that that killer's name? I've heard about him. Good, they caught him. Have you been following that story, George? Pretty interesting stuff. Hey, it could make a good book, one day. Oh, what's the use? That'll be the usual, 25 cents. I was hoping you'd throw me a curve on your price, Smitty. Curve balls? Hey, in April, you can see as many as you like when the Dodgers play. Says here, Robinson is thinking of retiring this year. You don't say, really? What a bum. Let New York keep 'em. I hear they're still pretty upset that they're moving here. Maybe we'll take their beloved Yankees, too, and have all three of their teams, right George? It would never happen. Jumping Joe is always out here anyways, George. You know what I mean? Jumping Joe, he's always out here anyways. Get it? Jumping Joe, he's always out here. He's always here, anyways. See you tomorrow, Smitty. He's always here. I don't get it, Smitty. Just drink your shake, Bub. - Operator? - Yes, operator. Please, fetch me the police. Is this an emergency, sir? - Yes, thank you. - Please hold. Los Angeles Police Department. Sergeant Jone's speaking. Who am I speaking with, please? This is Steven Wells. What's your emergency, Mr. Wells? Sir, I would like to record a murder. A murder, did you say a murder, Mr. Wells? I think I killed my wife. Again. Sir, what exactly, what are you saying? 8585 Sunset Boulevard. The door's gonna be open. We'll be waiting here. Please. Steven Wells. W-E-L-L-S. Thank you. Ms. Daniels will see you now, Mr. Lazarus. Okay, thank you. Seems very messy and strange, Mr. Lazarus. Their policy was strictly built for a retirement plan. Then we started to offer this, and of course, in the nature of our business, placed it under the banner of term life, which indicates that we must pay out a lump sum for any terminal or critical illness, as well, if the claim has proven to be true without any fraud intact. This will completely bankrupt us, and our three affiliates, if this policy is valid. Look, I had a chance to read through the documents while I was waiting to meet your husband, Harry. Pardon, he and Hitchcock's quick in and out entry. Due to this policy, he was needed for a discussion with our shareholders in Fresno, but that's part of the trouble with Harry. Excuse me, Ms. Daniels? Nothing jumps out at me for this to be considered fraud. Fraud occurs when any act is committed with the intent to falsely obtain some benefit or advantage to which someone is not entitled. Well, I know what the definition to fraud means. This claim, seems legit. This policy is for 13 people who worked over at the Deadly Sin Cigarettes Company. The company on paper is owned by two brothers. Yes, Enoch and Eliza Schindler. Who now sit on the sidelines and witness what is happening to their world. What do you mean, on paper? They don't exist, Mr. Lazarus! They disappeared! My husband, Harry, received a telegram early last year on our wedding anniversary, April the 22nd. I found it odd that we received a telegram early on a Sunday morning from an, Mr. L. B. Jefferies, stating that the company, Deadly Sin, now has a new owner and president who will oversee all operations. The company, at the time, had some issues. So they needed someone with good business sense to come in and keep it running. But the wrong man sits at the helm of Deadly Sin, causing, now this. My company to act in frenzy. You need to clear this up. You need to catch a thief. You need to pull the curtain back. No, no, thank you, I don't smoke. Look as I stated, Ms. Daniels, I don't see anything odd. I don't see odd in the claim. The names on this claim were all let go within three days of one another. They all state the same illness, causing company hardship. They also listed them as supervisors and employee of the month. The man who now pulls the rope over there is Mr. Mammon Beelzebub, a self-reformed ex-gangster from New York. Now a legit businessman. A real model citizen. He and his over-protective daughter run the place. They all state the same date on the policy, which is August 13th. I have your attention now, Mr. Lazarus? False insurance claims are claims filed with the intent to defraud an insurance provider, which is me! Out of $13 million. Investigate! Please, investigate. Will do, Ms. Daniels. - You have a good day. - Thank you. Donovan said he saw one that was huge, said it's the size of a small cat! Do they even come that big? You look like hell. You still got the flu? How's your arm healing up from Roger's dog bite last week? You lost a lot of blood. How's the arm? I haven't really looked at it. You know, I thought that dog was going to pull your arm right out of the socket. Never seen anything like that before. First, he attacks your dog, then you. You know, oh, this damn machine. Gotta get maintence down here. It's like the fifth time, they fixed this thing. You know, Ronnie had to put 'em down for fear of his kid's life. Good, get rid of that beast. Yeah, hell, maybe his wife, too? You know, what, what, what would, what were you, what possessed you to bring that little dog of yours to play poker over there, man? You know he's got that big son of a bitch running around that shit hole yard of his. Damn, this machine! Mickey, you all right? You know, you provoked that animal, yep, you did. You know, you cooked dinner for us. You got the steak and chicken all over ya. You make two bowls of food, one for Diesel and one for your little ankle biter, Oliver. You all right there, Buddy? Let me get that for ya, let me get this. Here, come on, drink it up. It's good, drink it up. That a boy. Oh, come on. You pissed yourself? I hold mine in all day. It gives me an edge. Tell me again, why you want me to stop? 'Cause if I stop, I'll fire you. And if I fire you, who will then support your high school drop out of a life? And those four unbalanced kids? You're such a sap, Tad. Any woman that has four kids from four other men is only after the support. It's tough being a lady these days. How many times, has she left you struggling? Hmm? How many times? Three? Four? When she goes out in the world and realizes she can't hold a job, it's time for 10. How many years have you been with this woman? 11? 12? When is it enough? So tell me again, why you want me to stop? You know, you can always leave her and come play with me! Your father would like to see you. I don't remember hearing you knock out. Get out! Ouch. Tell me. You know? I admire you. You still stay and put up with that woman's crap. Thinking you can change her unbalanced ways. Hmm. Hmm. I told you, a long time ago, she's a disease. A disease needs to be cured. And that's what I am for you. A cure. Hmm. Your escape! Think about how much money you'll save. I am your only pleasure. And you know that. Pansy! What a horrible time, here, telling Jimmy's wife and family, were very tough for us. Jimmy, Jimmy- - I shut down production lines, send everybody home. It wasn't about profit margin that day. You have any idea- - It was about losing people. Here at Deadly Sins, we're a family, a family, I say. It wasn't about profit. It was about valuable people. You have any idea how much- - This day and this tragedy nearly crippled us, paying for funerals, paying for family benefits. - So- - Scrapping machinery. Tossing merchandise. I'm trying to get some answers here, sir. Next time you come, you're going to do two things, eh. Okay. You're going to make a schedule with us and you're going to come here and you're going to show me respect, Mr. Lazarus. You're not just going to barge into a man's office to talk about things that you already know. So you tell your company, next time they send you, please, schedule it. - Will do, Mr- - Thank you. Marjorie, four, two, two, eight. You have a good day, sir. I say, four, two, two eight, please, hmm. Hmm, I don't know what you want me to say or what you want me to do. That was two weeks ago. But yes, we did meet. Thank God. Well, I would just like- - When will they cut us our payment? Oh, well that's a different department. We're here to talk about- - If you're not here to talk settlement, what are you doing here wasting our time? Well, you see, Mr. Bee-za-bub. - Beelzebub. - Beelzebub. This was one of the last places that my fiance, George, visited. And I would just like to ask you a few- - My father already told you. Did you not understand anything, he just said? Sassy, this one! She wanted to be a star when we came out to Hollywood. She wanted to be in pictures. She wanted her name on the marque, up in the lights, until I told her, I said, my darling, stars are for imbeciles. You will make more money and have power, more money than what those studios pay those so-called contract players. She is the future of Deadly Sins. I've answered all your questions. I've answered to Thayers. I've answered your fiancee. I've even, now, answered yours, but nobody seemed to have answered mine yet. Who will bring me my money? Would it be you, little girl? Would you bring me my money or would it be Sambo? Would you fetch me my money? I think we're done here. We're going to head back to the office and see what the holdup is with processing and your check. Sambo. If you shut down a production room, you're shutting it down. You don't absorb the people in any other place. Do you understand, that's the business! I don't care about- - But father, they're innocent people, you can't just- - It doesn't matter who it is. It doesn't matter. They're gone, they're gone, that's period. Period! Speak, MacMan. You've gotta come to the production room. Why do I got to come to the production, since when do I go to the production room, MacMan? You've just gotta come to production room one. What is it, Jimmy? Is it Jimmy, again? I told you it's Jimmy. He should've got rid of Jimmy a long time ago, little girl. Go see what he wants! Yes father, I'll handle it. Yeah, you'll handle it. You'll handle everything. You want to handle people. You want to keep people on the payroll. If we don't need them, we don't need 'em! Take that screaming woman out of here. Calm down, calm down. Little girl, you don't need to see this. Okay. Lucinda, darling, you don't need to see this. You don't need to look at this. MacMan! Clean this up. Clean it all up. MacMan, what do you think you're doing with that? We can throw it out with them. Throw it out with them, see? Tossing it out, tossing it out. You see what I'm doing here, MacMan? You see what I'm doing? I'm tossing my money away. Why don't you do the same thing with my investment. Now, clean that up, wipe it down and get all this nice and clean. - But- - No butts, MacMan. But, it's contaminated. Contaminated? This is what you're going to do, MacMan. You're going to clean up my investment. You're going to put it in that machine, you see? And you're gonna run production as planned. And you're gonna take my product and you're going to put it in a pallet. You're going to store the pallet in a warehouse, MacMan. And you're going to take 13 employees, whoever you want. I don't care. You're going to reward them as employees of the month. You'll take their pictures. You'll hang them up in the lobby. And then, Mr. MacMan , you're going to take my investment. You're going to ship it out. And we're gonna wait. Do I make myself clear, Mr. MacMan? Because... I won't hesitate. I will shoot you right here, right now, right where you stand. Do I make myself clear, Mr. MacMan? Look at this menu. This is George's favorite thing to eat, burgers and shakes. He loved it more than anything else in this world. Well, not the hot plate of corn beef hash. George loved that, too. On the other hand, he really didn't like liver. I mean, I couldn't get that man to eat liver. Well my Uncle Ben always takes us to this burger place in Pennsylvania. It's up near Milford. Madison's Madness. They're famous for being crazy with their food. I have no idea what that means. They form characters out of their food. Well, let's say for instance, you order a short stack of pancakes. They call it the village. And they design it to look like a scene from the three little pigs. No! Well, the pancakes will be the house with the little sausages living inside of it. It's the three little pigs. That's what I mean, weird stuff like that. That sounds like a cute place. It is. It's fun. It's a bit odd but fun. Traditionally, we go there after he takes us to see the civil war reenactments. It's cool, they dress up and they reenact the battles. - Wow, it sounds exciting. - It's cool, it's cool. George is such a history buff, he would have loved that. But do you know what I really find weird is? Okay, I have another cousin, lives in Wilmington, North Carolina. They, too, have a civil war reenactment. Okay, so what's wrong with that? Well, well, you're in the South. I mean, you lost the war. Why would you want to continue to reenact something that you lost? It's not like the outcome is going to be different. I mean, am I right? You're right. Excuse me, would you mind moving to the other side of the room? Chip, don't move. No, thank you. We're fine right here. Look, I don't want any trouble. Just eat your food and go. I hate bigots. That's okay. Thank you, for what you just did. That meant a lot. Do you think he's okay? We're gonna find him, Ms. Bethany. I'm mean this, this is just so not like George. He was just by the book, by the book of rules, thoughtful, punctual. Even if he was going to be a few minutes late, he always called. Well, well, we, we... we searched all the hospitals in the area. We visited all the surrounding area police stations. I mean, they're even helping us with this, so I don't even know what else we could do. I just feel like the only thing we can do is, what we've been doing. Back track his steps. Well, what's next on that list of yours? Hi, are you ready to order? Hello? Hello? Howard? Hello? Howard? Howard Caine? Howard, hello? I'm George Lazarus. Howard? Mr. Caine? Hello? Hello, Mr. Caine. Hello? Howard? Hello? Howard? Anybody home? Poking around people's property will get your shot. Listen, I'm looking for Howard Caine. I'm George A. Lazarus. - I work with Topaz Insurance. - Insurance? Is this his home? 'Cause I was told that I could find him here. I was told by Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie and Wanda Martinez? What, I don't know them from Adam. Insurance, huh? Turn around. - Real slow. - Sure, sure. You can put your hands down. Okay. - Insurance, huh? - Yeah. Yeah, Howard does live here. I'm his wife. May I get you something? Pop? Coffee, tea? Pop sounds great. Much appreciated, madame. Oh, I am not no madame, nmm, hmm. Name's Eve. Want one? No thank you, no thank you. I don't smoke. - Appreciate it. - Really? Hmm. He's probably around back working on that car in the garage. He loves tinkering on that thing. He's making it his life mission to get that car running again. What'd you want to talk to my husband about? - Insurance? - Yeah. 'Cause we're not interested. Hell, it's hard enough to come up with the mortgage each month, for this here dump, ever since Howard lost his job at the plant. Darned thing, too. Reward him as employee of the month. Gave him a case of smokes. Even put his picture in the paper. Smack dab on page seven of the Tribune, right next to Bogart dying. So strange. - Is that right? - Hmm hmm. I told Howard, see, you ain't even gotta be a movie star to get in the paper. Just have to do business with the devil. The devil? I don't understand. My husband isn't right. He's sick. He got some kind of bug at the plant. I took him to the doctors and they stated that, maybe he got stung by some killer bee or maybe he's allergic or something. See... We have a beehive in the back and Howard tends to them all the time. So he is not allergic! No. No, no sir. Something at that plant did something to my Howard. Eve, I need to speak to Howard. I've got to sit down. I got to talk to him. I got to ask him some routine questions, I need to get answered. He's in the back. Thank you. Good day. Howard, Mr. Caine? I heard you talking to my wife, Mr. Lazarus. Normally, I would introduce myself and shake your hand. But the way you're staring at me suggests I must look worse than I did yesterday. Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. Caine. I didn't mean to. Tell you the truth , I haven't looked at myself today. I didn't like what I saw yesterday. - Mr. Caine. - Doctors tell me... Nothing's wrong. Sir? I'm here, I'm investigating a claim that was placed by your former employer, Deadly Sin Cigarettes. I don't feel like talking much these days, especially about those bastards. So, I won't waste your time. Head down to the lounge. On Vermont. See Roger Abel. Roger Abel? Sir, I don't have a Roger Abel. I don't have a Roger Abel on my list, Mr. Caine. Mr. Caine. You must have the employee of the month list. Roger wouldn't be on that. But he was there. And he was let go, as well. Well... Talk to Roger. He loves to talk. Now, I'd appreciate it, if you let me be. Please, please go. Please. Good day, Mr. Caine. My Lord. I'm sorry for my sins. With my all heart, in choosing to do wrong. I'm saying to you, God. I've sinned against you. Hello? Mrs. Caine? Hello! - You find anything? - No. - Ms. Bethany! - What? This door is open. Let's see if someone's inside. Ready? Yep, I'm ready. Hello! Now why did I know that it was going to happen? Oh, I have a light that I use for my camera. It doesn't last long, - maybe 30 minutes or so. - Okay. But the only thing is, it burns off the battery of the camera and it burns a lot of battery juice. Well, I was planning on shooting footage anyway, so. Let's just get it working. I don't want to be here any longer than we have to, but yes, we should always document everything. The sooner we get out of here, the better. Hello? Now this feels wrong. It feels like a Vincent Price movie. In one of his movies, these people, they were trapped and- - Now just, I, you know how I feel about horror movies. Mrs. Caine! Who's that? Well, of course, it's going to be strange noises coming from a dark house we're walking through. Maybe the pod creatures from outer space. Did you and Mr. George ever see last summer's film, Invasion of a- Stop it Benjamin! I don't like horror movies. I'm sorry, Ms. Bethany. Besides, the sound came from upstairs. Well, now you're beginning to scare me, Ms. Bethany. Uh, what now? What, what, what's going on? I'm not sure. What's going on? You told me that thing was going to last 30 minutes. I know- - And it's only been nearly 10. Oh shoot. Well, the battery life is still good. It's still rolling. Maybe the light has a short on it, some way? - What the hell was that? - I don't know. That definitely wasn't no Vincent Price. We gotta, we gotta call the police. We've got to get you to a hospital, oh my God. No, I wanna go back in there and shoot it. No, no! I wanna go in there and shoot it. No, we don't even know what that is. We don't even know what it is. The gun was on the counter. We can go in there and shoot it. No, no, we have to call the police. - We can shoot it. - Call the police. We've gotta get you to a hos- My Lord. What is that? Mrs. Bethany, I'm okay to run now. Let's go. What can I get ya? I'm here to see Roger. Roger Abel. Never heard of him. Howard sent me.

Hello? I don't know how you do it. But you always catch me at the right time to make me smile. - Thank you. - No problem, kid. Did you look at it? Catchy title. Very sexy. You'll be the female lead. It's really the next project. Next summer, August 4th, you're up? So it's not until August 4th? - Yeah. - Oh, okay. That's when they need me to report? Yeah. I really appreciate your help on this one. You're okay, kid. So, maybe have some time for us to get together for a drink sometime, maybe at the little place you like so much. I can be there if you like. God knows I need it after the summer I just had. Are you okay? It'll be a fun break away from Arthur. Oh, oh, you have problems? Maybe the alone time will give us that needed spark again. Is there anything I can do? Maybe, just maybe, it'll inspire him to write me a juicy role to play in one of his movies. You're such a misfit. I am not a misfit. That sounds like another catchy title. Misfits. What do you think? Yeah, I don't think so. No? And why not? I don't see you in a title like that. You're my special lady. You're so sweet. I would definitely love to get together. Okay, kid. - Talk to you soon. - Thank you. - You be well. - We'll talk soon. - Bye. - Bye. Some like it hot.
