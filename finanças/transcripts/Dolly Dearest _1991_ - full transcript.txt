Ladies and gentlemen, the captain has informed me our estimated time of arrival in hapalla, Mexico, is 1:15. Did you say something to me? No. That was the stewardess. We're almost there. Great. You know, this is a lost art. Her techniques haven't been used for years, and the results, magnificent. Hmm. This one goes to susie baker. Her address is... It's okay, honey. I have all addresses right here. Okay. I didn't know she had so many friends. She's written most of them twice. Look at this, sweetheart. This is the doll your daddy's going to make in Mexico. You see? This is the factory where we're going to make her and sew her little dresses. Isn't she beautiful? And you are gonna be the only little girl in the world whose daddy makes such beautiful dolls. Won't we have fun? We are going to be such a success! Can we go back to Los Angeles then? Sefior Wade.

Hello little Wade children your belongings have arrived safely and I'm unpacking them for you now. Come in. Hey, it's a cool house. I wasn't expecting this. You like to read? There is much history of our country in these books. No kidding? Jessie? Sefior Wade, you want to go to the factory? Let's go. Daddy? Can I please go with you? Of course, honey, come on. Come on, let's take a look at our new business. It's okay go on. We're here. Yecchh. Senora deluga make the finest dolls in the whole world. She win many awards. When I was a little child, I would come here just to watch them paint the little faces, and such a beautiful doll she create just before she die. It's a great pleasure having handled this for you, Mr. Wade. It's my first sale. Mr. Estrella, the appraisal documents indicated the factory had been kept up after sefiora deluga's death. Yes, sir. We have been very careful to keep everything just as it was. Why, no one ever comes to the factory, not for any reason. Yes. I see. Come, let me show you over here where all the molding equipment's been stored. Mr. Estrella, what's this big, round mixing thing? Oh, that is where they combine all the ingredients to make the deluga dolls. The future heartthrob of millions of little girls. Once in a lifetime opportunity. Si, of course, seiior, I understand that. We need a little cleaning, perhaps. The market projections. The assessments. Who prepared that material? 1, 1 did that, sir. I copy from American business book. Nice work. Jessica, are you in here? I'm up here, daddy. Look what I found. May I have one, daddy? Oh, look at that. Fabulous. Every little girl in the world is going to want one of those. I want that one. Well, you've got it. My first sale. Thank you, daddy. I'm going to love her so much. Jimmy! Uh, Mr. Estrella, what is that? What's going on over there? That is Mayan ruins. They uncover much history of Mayan civilization. Very important find. Mayan, huh? We studied about them last semester. They were pretty cool dudes. Cool or not, I don't want you going over there. Yeah, last week they had an unfortunate accident. A man was crushed by a stone underneath the earth. Work's been suspended until the archeologist from the university arrives. I'm going to brush your hair. So the end of a long day. Tomorrow we'll all start unpacking. Now, won't that be fun? Probably not. Good night, sweetheart. Don't forget to say good night to Dolly. Sweet dreams, Dolly. Good night, Dolly. You're going to be my new playmate. You're going to be my only playmate. Mmm, these vegetables smell good. These all come from my brother's garden. I get you good price, of course. He uses fresh Turkey manure. Turkey manure is the very best. It gives you the best crop. Really? Mm-hmm. I didn't know that. Now, my sister, she makes us all very proud. She gave her life to the church. She belongs to the nuns of the carmelitas, the carmelites. Really? Uh-huh. Mommy! Just leave it on the table with the other letters, honey. I wanted to tell you I'll be in the back yard. You and I can go play in the Dollhouse. Jessie, is that you? We're almost ready to go, honey. Is anyone out there? What is it? Mom, what is it? Jessica! Jessica! Jessica! Tell me what's wrong. What's wrong with her? No! I want Dolly! Jimmy. Camilla. Camilla? What is the priest doing here? I called the priest to bless the house. It is custom. Professor resnick. What? The photos from hapalla have arrived. Ah, at last. What do you think? Could this be the tomb? I'm not sure. Have you ever seen this symbol before? No, sir. I'm certain it's not Mayan. They haven't disturbed the sarcophagus, have they? No, no one has touched a thing since larabe's body was removed. When are you leaving? Bob larabe and I were friends for over 30 years. Did you know that? No, sir. I'm leaving right now. How is she? She seems all right. We had a long talk about her old playmates at school mostly. I wish you would have seen her, Elliot. She scared me, really scared me. There's no reason for it. None. I'm gonna take Jimmy with me to the factory tomorrow and give you two some time together. Good. That, that would help. The sewing machines arrive next week. Did I tell you? Oh, yes. You told me. It's a secret. That's funny. Why are you doing that? Jessica, what are you doing? Dolly says we're going to like it here. Oh, we are going to like it here, honey. Now, come on. Let's go to bed. Well, it looks like you're enjoying your lunch. What is that, honey? I don't know. Well, did you see it somewhere? Dolly told me. She says she's been waiting for a little girl just like me. Sweetheart. Jessica! Jessica, I saw that! Camilla, I am so sorry. She, I, I don't know what's gotten into her. Kinta kintero. What? Jessica! Jessica, come back here! Camilla, I am terribly sorry. She's never had outbursts like this before. It is the sanzia. She spoke the ancient language of the sanzia. Wait a minute, wait a minute, what are you talking about? I know of their language. I know of these people. Their spirits fly with the evil one. No. No. I know that you wouldn't lie. I won't tell. I can keep a secret. What do you want? Don't talk to me in that tone, young lady. Why did you push Camilla? I saw you do it. Why? Camilla prays to the spirits, and her spirits hate Dolly. Jessie, whatever it was you said to Camilla, did you hear it from her? Dolly told me. Stop saying that! Now, where did you hear it? Okay come on. I want you to apologize to Camilla. Leave Dolly here. I'm sorry I pushed your plate. Camilla, I don't want to interfere with your religious practices, but... Sefora, there is evil here. I can feel it. I pray to protect us from the evil spirit. Right, right, right. That's my point. In the future, I would appreciate it if you could just, uh, make your observances more private. If you could just... I understand. Today I spoke to my sister in the convent. I think it's best that you find someone else for your house. Where are you going? We're just going out for a quick dinner. Did you have a good time with mommy today? It was okay. She's been acting very funny lately. Maybe you should have a talk with her. I don't think she likes it here. Do you know what? I think you're right, and we're going to have to be very patient with mommy. Good night, honey. Good night, daddy. Good night, Dolly. Dolly? Dolly? Dolly, where are you? Dolly, don't hide from me, please. Dolly? Dolly? Dolly, where are you? Jessie, follow me. Jessica. Jessica! What are you doing? Come back in the house. Jessica! Why aren't you listening to me qirl? I'm talking to you. Jessica, you come back in the house. You sit down. I'll go around the front. Jimmy! Open the door! Ay! This kid. Jessica, is that you? Jessie, now we can play. No lights. Camilla said there was a problem with the fuse box. I'll check. Jimmy? Huh? You scared me. What's with the candle? The electricity is out. Is your sister in here? No. Maybe she's with Camilla. I'll go. Camilla's not there. Well, then they must be together. I bet they're in your room. Oh. Damn it. Maybe they're downstairs. She's so afraid of the lightning. Jessie? She's not in there. Oh, my god. She's in the Dollhouse. I'll get you all tucked in and cozy and I'll read you a bedtime story. Would you like that? I just spoke with her family. They're making all the arrangements. Are you okay? Jessica, would you lock the door? Lock the door now. That's a good girl. Ah, she's listening. If she comes, don't open it. No, no. Jessica, don't open it. Jessie, open up the door. Jessica? What did you do to your hair? We cut it. Don't I look like Dolly now? Jessica, you were holding the door. Dolly locked the door. She doesn't like people coming in here. This is our house. Jessie, I want you to leave Dolly here and I want you to come with me. No, thank you. We'd rather stay here. I'm sorry, mommy. It's just that Dolly's the only friend I have, and I don't want to lose her. Can I stay for just a little while? I'll leave the door open. I love you, mommy. I love you, too. I love you so much. Are you okay? I'm okay, mommy. I am. Okay. God! Sorry. Come on! Get the hell out of there! Hi. Uh, you're the archeologist from the university? Hi. I'm Jimmy Wade. My dad owns the factory over there. Son, the sign up there says "no pase." That means this entire area is off limits, so please, take a hike. Okay, but you're going to need my help when you get down in there. Further down, you'll see the top is caved in, the opening's too small. You won't be able to squeeze through. I'll take my chances. I'll wait. How far back have you been in there? Uh, only about halfway, but I can squeeze through to the end. I can do it. I can be like your eyes and ears for you. What do you think? Does your father know you're down here? Sure, he does. My father's always looking for ways to further my education, so let me crawl on top and take a look for you. I've done it before, but it's getting kinda dark in there, if you know what I mean. Look, I appreciate your fondness for exploration, but we'll both just have to wait to see what's inside the crypt. A crypt. I knew it was a crypt! Hey! Come back here. Hey. Oh. Neat hat. What do you see? Uh, I don't know. It's real small. It's a coffin, I guess. But it's made out of stone maybe? All right, that's enough. Come out of there now! Wow. What a rush. Now what? Ow! Ow! Don't you ever do that again. I won't. You hear? You know, I've been reading up you know, on the Mayans because I wanted to be prepared for when you got here. I mean, you being from the university and me only being in seventh grade. I just didn't want you to think that I couldn't handle the job, because I can. I can handle the job. What job? Your assistant. Does your dad's factory have a phone? Oh, sure. Come on. He'll let you use it. So, uh, who's buried in there? A Maya king? He must be a short guy. This is like king tut, right? Are you coming? I'll go get my dad. Put the boxes over here. This is my father, Elliot Wade. Karl resnick. I hope this isn't an imposition. You can use my phone anytime. These creatures are beautiful. Very haunting. Yes, they are. The more I'm with them, the more they take on a life of their own. I'm sorry about the accident at your excavation. Thank you. Bob larabe was a very dedicated man. If his theory is correct, this excavation will answer many questions about a bizarre tribe of people called the sanzia. What do you mean, it's not Maya? Oh, no. Not Maya. The sanzias occupied this area about 900 years ago. Sanzia means Satan on earth. Sounds fascinating. When do you start? I'll start tonight. My men will arrive tomorrow. The pipe! The pipe! There's water all over! Okay water main. Excuse me. The phone is in the corner. Help yourself. Give me a hand. Tonight, huh? When the sun disappears, I expect your face to go with it. Understood? Sanzia. Sanzia. "Cult of the dead." Wow. It's may the third. 1900 hours. I'm in the tunnel. I have already observed these inscriptions on the photographs sent to me by larabe. They appear to be sanzia. I'm going to remove the earth by hand. No, we already finished. When will you be home? In about an hour. The fridge again? No, it's not that. It's, uh, it's Jessica. What's wrong with her? I don't know what's wrong. I'm worried about her. I don't know, uh, I don't know what to do about this fixation she has on the doll. Let me finish here, and I'll be home soon. All right. Okay sure. We'll talk about it when you get back. Okay I love you. I love you, too. Mr. Wade, you join me in a burrito? Sounds good, Luis, but no, thanks. I'm going to be getting out of here soon. Well, I think I better go to bed. So early? Good night! That's it. I've had it. Luis, it's all yours. Lock up for me. Good night. Good night, Mr. Wade. I can now see additional inscriptions on the left side of the crypt. Larabe was right. They're sanzia. They are warnings, warnings not to cross the threshold of the tomb. Senorita. I say you join me for dinner, eh? You look very lovely tonight, huh? Heh heh heh heh! Of course you look lovely every night. You want to lambada, no? Whoo-hoo! You come up to my room later, eh? No? You women, you're all alike, you know? Well, let me tell you something. You're ugly, and your nose is shiny, too. Heh heh heh heh! You got a big head. All women have big heads. You wait here. I'll be right back. Hey, hey, give me a hand. Surprise. We got you. We got you. The interior of the crypt is three meters by three by 2.5 in height. It doesn't appear that it's been entered. It's beautiful. It's at least 900 years old. The detail is amazing. It is the story of creation. It is the story of the birth of evil on earth. Oh, god, larabe. It is the crypt. This is where the sanzia have entombed the devil child. Oh, man. What a screw up. Now we'll have some fun. Is anybody here? Who are you? Are you crazy? What are you doing? You must stop this. Everybody will be killed if you do not stop this. What are you talking about? Who are you? You brought their evil back, with your picks and your shovels. Close the tomb now and leave. The sanzias are dead. All of them are dead. He opened up the gate to hell, and the killings began. There will be others. The soul of the sanzia child is alive. It has returned. All of the children are in danger. Close the tomb now and maybe god will spare us. Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait for me! What was that about? Superstition. There's frequent opposition to dredging up the past, a past descendants of the sanzias would prefer we left in secrecy. I'm looking for my son. He snuck out of the house. I thought he might be here with you. Jimmy, my assistant, the explorer? No, I haven't seen him, ha, yet. What's going on here? That's it. I'm getting out of here. Dad, there's a man in there. He's dead! I saw him! Jimmy, stop it. Calm down. Calm down. Stay here. Luis! Luis? Luis! Luis! Hello? It's an emergency. We need an ambulance... At camino El Rey Looks like it was a heart attack. Under the circumstances with Luis, I'm not going to punish you, but what you did was totally irresponsible. Just what did you think you were gonna do out there? I don't know. Mr. resnick mentioned that old tribe, and I read all about them, how they were like really weird dudes. They tried to make, like, an evil kid or something, you know, a devil child, they called it. Sanzias were into really scary stuff. It just got me going, I guess. What did you say the name of that tribe was? Sanzia. From now on, you can forget about some of the more exotic goings-on around here, such as Mr. resnick and the archeological digs. What? Dad, come on. The digs are a cool place. What does that have to do with anything? It has to do with your ability to separate what's real and what's not. What are you doing? I thought that you'd be more comfortable if Dolly slept over there in the chair. Don't touch her. Jessica, I'm taking the doll out of the bed and I don't want hear another word about it. I'll kill you! I'll kill you if you try to separate us! I'll kill you! She's mine! She's mine! Whoa! Neat trick with your voice. Daddy, mommy's trying to take Dolly away from me. Don't take her, daddy! Calm down. I want my Dolly. It's okay. We keep each other company. Come on. Get under the covers now. Jimmy, go to your room. She said she'd kill me. If you'd heard her voice, Elliot. Elliot, she's changing. She's, she's changing. It's, it's the doll. It's controlling her somehow. It's doing something to her. Don't you see it? No, I don't see it. I see that you've changed. What you're saying is completely irrational. I want to get her out of here. I'm afraid for her. I want to take her back to la. Marilyn, we've invested everything into this factory. We can't just pack up because our seven-year-old is having a tantrum. Honey, we'll work with her, okay? She'll be all right. Just let her go through some changes. You're not hearing a word I'm saying. That man, that man Karl resnick, what do you know about the crypt in the field? Why is he so interested in it? He's interested because he's an archeologist. What are you suggesting? I don't know. I don't know. I'm trying to make sense of it. Camilla was frightened of the sanzia. She said that Jessica spoke to her in their language. You told me yourself Camilla spent half the day mumbling over burning candles. If Jessica said anything, she heard it from her. No, she didn't, Elliot. She heard it from someone, but it wasn't her. Okay I'm sorry. I'm tired, I'm hungry, it's the middle of the night, and I don't want to hear this right now. Mr. resnick, I'm Marilyn Wade. Oh, happy to meet you, sefora Wade. I see your beauty in your son's face. How is he? He had a rough night. It was an unfortunate experience. Yes, it was. I wonder if I could talk to you about these carvings down here. Oh, please. These. These were removed from the tomb? Yes. Well, actually, they're portions of the damaged door. See, the details are exquisite. These are very old. Sanzia, right? Correct. Our son tells us these people have a grisly history. What is it that you're looking for? We're looking for the remains of the sanzia devil child. The legends say the sanzia prepared a place for the birth of Satan's child. They suckled a child that was neither man nor beast. It had the body of an infant and the head of a goat. They fed it with the warm blood of slaughtered children. A child so evil that its reign of terror almost caused their extinction before they put the creature to its howling death. And you knew this before you opened the crypt? Sefora, whatever made the sanzia afraid, this child was not supernatural. - How do you know it wasn't? - Because I'm a man of reason. It's not possible. Mr. resnick, my daughter has been drawing these symbols since we arrived here. Our housekeeper Camilla told me that Jessica spoke sanzia to her. She tried to warn me, and now she's dead and so is the night watchman, and so is your archeologist, and my daughter is being touched by something, by some outside force. Sefior resnick! We need help with the machine! How much time? Sefiora, where are you going? Camilla said she has a sister in the convent. I want to speak with her. Uh, mom said you should take a nap. Um, but that's okay, you don't have to if you don't want to. Do you speak english? Yes, I do. I'm looking for sister alva. Sister alva is ill. A member of her family has passed away. Yes, I know. Please, it's very important that I see her. She's in seclusion. Please. My daughter's life is in danger. I'm Marilyn Wade. I know who you are. I'm very sorry about your sister. Did Camilla tell you about my daughter? You of the modern world. You put your faith in your machines, your science. You ignore the powers of heaven and hell. My sister tried to warn you. Yes, I know she did. But, please, tell me now. What is happening to my daughter? How can I stop it? It's too late. The spirit of the sanzia devil child has been set free. It's too late. Listen to me, I'm not losing my daughter to a goddamn 900-year-old goat head! Tell me what you know. How does this thing, this spirit work? Could it, could it go into something other than a human? Could it go into a doll? The devil takes any form it desires. It can be one, or it can be many. The sanzia devil child wants children. It will do anything to spread its word to the children. Through the dolls? I don't know what course Satan will travel. All I can do is pray for their salvation. You see? It has begun. There will be no end to its reign of fear. It's fear that keeps them ignorant. To believe that malarkey is insanity. Maybe it is, maybe it is. I have a husband who thinks it's insanity, and I'm inclined to agree with him, but I have a daughter at home who's being controlled by a fucking doll. Now, you tell me what the hell that is. Jessica? Are you in there? Shh. What are you doing in there? I'm hiding. Where's Jessica? They're in their room. Ma, ya gotta go look. The doll talks. I saw it. It moves and everything. The door's locked. I need a... Jessica? Jessie? Where is she? What have you done with her? She's in here with me. She belongs to me. You'll never get her back now. We're together forever! Ha ha hal she'll always be mine! Mommy, mommy, help me! Help me! No! I want my daughter! Call your father at the factory. I'm going to get her out of there. Mom, it's busy. I can't get through. Keep trying. Jimmy, I want you to stay downstairs. Suppose you need me? Do as I say for once! Jessica? Operator? Uh, emergencia. Interruption. No. Interruption. What? No. Never, nevermind. Oh, sweetheart. Oh, sweetheart. Jimmy, get in the car! Jimmy, where are you? Oh, goody. We're going for a ride. Get out of my way. Jessica, let's play with mommy. Hold her down! Don't let her go! We'll fix mommy! Get her! Get her! Let's kill her! I hate you! Kill her! Play with this, bitch. Uhh, uhh. Mommy. Mommy. It's time to play. Oh, my god. It's true. What have I done? Pull it! We've got you now! This is fun! You! Ready to go in the mixer? Help! Help! Oh! You! Help! Ready? No! Help! Help! No! Help! You want to be next? Help! Where do you kill the power? On the wall! Are you all right? I got to get home. There's another one at the house. Thank god you're all right. Elliot, it was alive. It was alive. I know. They're all alive. How is this happening? I don't know. Wow. Oh, my god. What are you going to do? We're going back inside. Take the kids down the hill. Elliot, no. Let's just get out of here, please. I don't know how this happened, but we're going to destroy them. All of them. Elliot, we can get help from someone. Don't go in there, please, Elliot! We don't have time to run a wire. The longest fuse is a minute. Place it and move on to the next. We'll line the inside perimeter. Take the right. I'll go to the left, we'll come down the center to the door. Perfect. Can I go? Can I set one? No. Jimmy, I want you down the hill with your mother. I don't want you anywhere near this factory. Here. Get down. Jimmy. Jimmy! I'm going to blow up the pit. Hey, come here! Bastards! Mom, get back! The pit's going to blow! Huh? Honey, it's over.
