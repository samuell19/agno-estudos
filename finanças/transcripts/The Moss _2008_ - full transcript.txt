This is a mystical world. The sky is bluer. The grass is greener. There's a shiny castle. Inside the castle, lives a girl with a green gemstone. One day, a demon abducted her from the castle. A warrior gave chase with his sword drawn. Guided by the gemstone, he raced to save the girl. The hottest day of summer It's me, Kei. - Is that you, Mom? - Where have you been? I'm on my way back. I know you like gemstones. I smuggled a valuable emerald back for you. - How did you smuggle it back? - It's gross. I'll tell you later. I would have been in trouble if the customs had found it. Get back soon. I'm only doing this because you're my mom. Okay, I'll be back soon. - Where are you now? - I'm at Tai Kok Tsui. That's Four-eyed Tong's turf. - Okay, I have to go. - Come back right away. Listen to me, don't stop for hookers! Come back quickly! $300. Max. Let's go! I asked the broad, "What's your name?" "Zu San." Body massage or full service? That's what she asked me. I couldn't see her face clearly. I didn't want to get a hideous beast of a woman. I lit my lighter, and I checked her out in the dim light. She's okay. Not bad at all. Early twenties. Big jugs. Small waist. - Who does she look like? - The actress Shu Qi. I get it, go on... Okay... be patient, I'm coming. Yes, all right... Hey kid, no need to go up. You're looking for Lulu, right? Follow me. Sir, what would you like me to do? - How about some oil? - Sure. Put some on yourself too. - Fung Ming Hotel - Hey, which is Lulu's room? - Let's go. - You have such young girls too? Hey, Boss! How's the girl that you picked? That girl... she didn't act like a tramp! That's normal. She's pure and innocent. Normal? But I wanted a wild one! You're here. Sit down and eat. Are you tired from the long trip? - Her lips... - Exactly like Shu Qi's. You would have the urge to push her head down. Pervert! Be a sex columnist if you like talking about such stuff so much. I have a new brothel for you to bust. Another one? I've already hit all the brothels! They are everywhere along the streets in this area. Come on! It's so hot outside! Can't I rest a bit? If you like the air-conditioning so much, get a transfer to a desk job! Move it! Go on! I'm going to the toilet. Get yourself a drink first. - What do you want to drink? - Iced coffee-tea. - Iced coffee-tea. - Less sugar. Did that rascal give you recommendations? Police raid. Flee. Those with valid visas, stay. Others, follow me downstairs. Police raid! Take the kid to the third floor. We'll be in trouble if they find underage girls here. This place stinks! Is it okay? The stairs are broken! Are you here for the stairs or the girls? - Hurry up! - Not so loud! - Hey, Bro! - Hey, Boss! - Room for you? - Oh, come on. Hurry up... Take a shower first, sir. Forget about showering. Hurry! - What's your name? - London. London? I'm your girlfriend tonight, okay? Okay. Licence check. Come out! - Darn it. - What's the matter? Coming... We suspect this to be a brothel. Show us your ID. This is bad! Where's the gemstone? Get out of my way! He's London. He's my boyfriend. Oh, he's your boyfriend London? Get out of my way... That hurts! You nutcase! Actually his name is Fai. He's a policeman. I'm a policeman, Miss. Your ID card, please. - You haven't paid. What ID? - What payment? - You didn't pay for my service! - Payment for a touch? Don't you dare hit me! You stupid broad! How dare you hit me! Even my mother never laid her hands on me! Stop! I didn't visit a prostitute. Hands off. - ID, please. - Pay me! - Hands off! - Pay me! Stop it! Do you want to get yourself killed? Sod off! You're just trying to get off with a free ride! Take her away! - Are you okay? - Move it! It's not my fault...! Assemble everyone. We're leaving. What do you have upstairs? I don't know, honestly. Let's check it out. Sis, what should we do? Just pretend you didn't see anything. Don't tell anyone about it. This happens all the time. It has nothing to do with us. - Understand? - Okay. Open the door! Anyone in there? Anyone in there? We are the police! Who lives next door? Run for it! Don't move! Don't move or we'll shoot! Run... Hey! Don't give chase! Call for backup! Darn it! What could possibly happen? The walls here are really thin. Drop something and all your neighbours can hear. I wanted to move some stuff. But I ended up knocking my cupboard over by incident... and smashing my bed. Jan, would I lie to you? You take care of our turf here. You know what we do around here. Brothels. Gambling dens. Drugs. We have everything. But we don't deal with guns. By the way, those chicks you've arrested to answer to your boss are the old girls. The remaining ones are the new girls... - What are you talking about? - Sorry! Move it! Indians! - Thanks a lot. - Thanks. - Hey, no leads. - Forget it. We're the vice squad, not the Organized Crime and Triad Bureau. We'll do what we can to help. But nothing beyond that. Hey Jan! Hey... I'm off. - Boss! Here it is. - Let me see his statement. You know him? We worked as undercover agents together. He didn't perform well, so he didn't get ahead. He's craftier than a crook. This place is filthy. It doesn't matter what you do. I can smell their faces these days. I can see their voices, and I can hear the scent of trash. I think I'm down with flu. I'm sorry... I didn't mean it. I didn't want to do it. You started it. Please don't haunt me. Recently, there has been a series of robberies targeting prostitutes... in the Sham Shui Po district. According to the victims..... the robbers are three armed Pakistanis. The following is a video captured by a passer-by. Darn, I hate this weather. It feels warm even with the air-con on. Get someone to fix the air-con. Why didn't you call me after you came back? I wouldn't have known you're back if I hadn't see you this afternoon. Why should I call you? I hang out with you because you don't talk much. Now I realise you're one tough cookie. You were deported less than two months ago, and now you're back. You haven't told me much about yourself either. Sometimes you're a cop. Sometimes you're a john. And sometimes you're a gangster. I'm only trying to make a living. That's right. I'm just trying to make a living. How about this? We'll find a day where you can take a break... and I don't have to work. We'll go to a beach somewhere, you can tell me all about yourself. And I'll tell you all about myself. Must we go to a beach? I'm hungry. Let's go for dinner. I want the girl I had last time. She was hot. Who? We have so many girls here. That's her... What are you doing, girl? Are you hungry? Why isn't the air-con working? You made this? Of course not. That guy made it. I took a bite. It tastes really awful. It's better if you don't eat it. Go and see a doctor. It's okay. I'll get better soon. Hey, let's go out for a walk one day. It's uncomfortable being cooped up here all day. No beach though, okay? - Hello? - Hello, Jan? We have a problem. Chong wants to see you. Come over now. - She wants to see me? - Yes. Hurry over. You're kidding right? No? You don't know? Next! Chong. My son Kei is a filial boy. He got me a special gift for my birthday. He said I'd definitely like it. He called me from Tai Kok Tsui and said he would be back soon. But I haven't seen him since. Tai Kok Tsui is Four-eyed Tong's turf. We've never got along. He once threatened to off my son and end my family line. Now he claims he doesn't know where my son is! Jan, I know he was your boss when you worked undercover. You know him well, right? Ask him what he wants. Return my son and everything is negotiable. Otherwise, I'll wipe out his gang. Chong. I'm a nobody. What can I do? I haven't seen Tong for ages. If you don't get me an answer by tomorrow, I won't let either you or Tong off. I'm not afraid to step on his tail. I can even order a hit on him! Continue with the beating! Beat him till he talks! Allow me. Smells good. Is someone cooking next door? - Wow, what's with the feast? - Wow! - So many dishes! - There's fish and chicken. It's really delicious. It's really good. Hey, teach me how to cook when you have the time. Perhaps you should cook for us. Then we don't have to order takeouts all the time. That's right... Who is he? Hey! He's crazy. Come over here... Jan... Tong is upstairs. - Tong. - Hey! Eat with me... It's great to eat hot pot with the air-con on during a hot day. - Thanks. - Sit down... What's wrong with you? Nothing. Flu. See a doctor if you're sick. Here, try this melon dumpling. It's good for the flu. - Tong... - Okay, say no more! When was the last time we had a meal together? Sing, do you still remember? That day, I asked him if he was an undercover agent. This idiot said "yes" right to my face! But he handled a lot of tricky jobs for me. He's a smart kid. Jan, I'm always happy to have you here for dinner and drinks. We've known each other for so long. You can be frank with me. You know me well. I'm happy that you came to visit me today. But I don't want to hear anything about Chong's son. Come on! Come on, dig in! I'm going to the toilet. Chong. I asked him. He has nothing to do with it. Hello? Chong? Hello? Where are you from? We're probably two of a kind. My home is a long way from here. My parents are dead. I came here to find my relatives. I want to earn a lot of money in the shortest time possible. Why do you wear so many layers of clothes on such a hot day? - Jan, tell Chong that... - Yeah? I, Four-eyed Tong, have nothing to hide. If I had done it, I would have admitted to it. Got it. Do be careful, Tong. Don't worry. I know she might just go postal on me. That's why I'm putting on this bullet-proof vest. Jan, visit us when you have the time. Don't visit me only when you're in trouble. And do take care of yourself. The weather has been bad. It's easy to fall sick. See a doctor soon. We're being hit... We're being hit... Cheng is down! Run! Go inside! Put the helmet on. It's safer. - Where's your gun? - I'm a vice cop, not a detective. I have to turn in my gun at the end of my shift! Where's Sing? This is bad... Let's go! That way... Tong, it's Sing! It's a dead end over here. Go that way. Car keys! Give me the car keys! Kick it over! Let's go... That way! Come on! Run! This way! Start the car! Hurry up! Run him over! Jan, wake up! Back up the car... Come on, wake up! Buckle up, Tong! Why is your brothel located so high up? I'm all sweaty from climbing the stairs! We're dealing with underage girls here. It's a serious offence. We definitely have to be cautious. Hey, she's pretty young and tender. Hey, come here...! - Come with me! - Move it, kiddo. Don't worry. I'll be good to you. Tong...! Are you okay? Tong...! Tong, are you okay? Darn it. I have a bullet-proof vest and a helmet on... and I still got hit! Oh no. Darn... Hey, didn't you say she's good to go? I've paid. Now what? I'll talk to her. She has ruined my mood! Sorry, Boss. Why don't you come another day? I don't think she's up for it today. That's not for you to decide! Now what? This girl... - I must have her tonight. - Come on... What are you staring at? What is it to you? What are you looking at, beggar? Stop staring... Come with me! Come on! Come with me! Quick... come with me! Quick! Hurry up! Hey, stop it! What are you staring at, beggar? This girl... That's not for you to decide! I must have her tonight. I've paid. We're probably two of a kind. My home is a long way from here. My parents are dead. Go away! Let go of me! I'm coming down now. Ambulance unit AF323 on site. This way. I'm coming in. Where's the ambulance? What's the situation? According to the witness, they were attacked by a beggar. What? You want me to wait some more? Find someone else if you don't think I'm good enough. Stop wasting my time. It's not as if you're paying me big bucks. And you still haven't paid me for the last time. What? Where am I? I don't know. It's a rundown place with lots of rubbish. I'll find out and call you. I want my money. As soon as possible. You're awake? Don't be scared... Last night, that guy swore at my mom, that's why I... Actually... I wanted to save you. Don't go... Let go of me! Let go of me! You didn't save me! You're just causing me problems. I came here to make money. You've messed up my plans! You've injured my sister! This morning at five, triad boss Four-eyed Tong... and three of his men were shot down. The only survivor was an Indian who was shot in the arm. There has also been a case of assault on the same day with three men injured... a woman in a coma from severe head injuries... and an eleven-year-old girl missing. According to the witnesses, the attacker was a violent beggar... Are you avoiding me? Why didn't you answer my calls? Your friend Tong was killed at around five this morning. It's obviously a gangland hit. Everyone knows Chong has been after him for her missing son. Hey I'm talking to you! My friend is lying there in ER. I haven't found her sister. I should be asking you questions! - Can you stop bothering me? - Who else should I bother? With all that happened last night... - I'm worse off than you! Now... - Then go out and investigate! Leave me alone! I don't know anything! - Doctor... - Hey Jan... Don't bother me! This is an emergency. The patient in there could die at any moment. Listen to me, I'm not done with you. If this goes on, all... hey! All hell will break loose! Chong and Tong never got along. She even found an excuse to kill him. I survived the hit. I'll definitely seek revenge. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone you were there that night. You're a cop. If your colleagues knew you were with Tong that night... you'd be in trouble. But if the cops catch the hitman, and he rats you out, you'll still be in trouble. You know what to do. We'll help you get the guy who hurt Lulu. - Jan, don't! - Don't mess with me! - I'm not, Jan! - Find that guy. You got it? Got it! I'll help you! You got it... Be careful with this. Why are you taking this upon yourself? - What's the situation? - Tong's gang is in a mess now. Chong has gone into hiding. The cops are looking for the hitman. That guy won't be able to get out of Sham Shui Po. - Keep a closer watch. - You can't rush things. They hired the hitman directly. No middleman involved. No one knows his background, and there are beggars everywhere. I'll do the best I can. It's going to take some time. Call me. My son is still missing, and I can't show my face! I'm holding you responsible for this! You have to settle it for me. There's no point in holding me responsible. I don't care! You must settle it for me! Baby. We managed to save her, but she's still in a coma. There's something we need to inform her family about. But we can't locate them. You're her first visitor so I'm telling you instead. She's about one month pregnant. Considering her condition, I suggest to abort the foetus. But despite her injuries, she's still hanging in there. Both mother and child have a strong will to live. Today's weather is great. I have opened the windows for you. Well, did you have a good night's sleep? The lady next door was noisy, wasn't she? I'll ask her to pipe down. Try to rest more. It'll be good for the baby. By the way, you can... you can talk to her. That might help to rouse her from her coma. - What should I talk about? - Anything works. Why don't you read her the paper? Your flu is pretty bad. Take some medicine. Or I won't let you in to visit her next time. A three-year-old falls to her death. Nurse... - What's the matter? - Why is the machine beeping? Oh, it's nothing. What did you read to her? - The newspaper. - Try reading this to her instead. Baby care is more appropriate. It's better for the patient and your child. My child? Who says it's my child? You're crazy! - Are you close to Lulu? - Why? Well... does she use condoms at work? Why wouldn't she? She's extremely careful. She would walk out on the clients who refused to wear one. Why do you ask? Nothing. Bye. I'd advise you to stay out of it. Look at you. Take a break and rest. Whether you're involved or not, just stay out of it. The whole team has been slaving away and coming up empty-handed. What can you accomplish by yourself? You get my drift. - Hello? - Daddy, are you busy? I'm working. I'll be home soon. - What're you doing? - Doing homework. - Still at it? - I need help on some questions. - Ask me. - What's AV? What's AV? Where did you learn that? Of course, I know. AV, right? It means "audio-visual." A for "audio," and V for "video." Daddy, you're great. You know everything. That goes without saying. Finish up your homework now. Get Mom if you need to use the computer. But sleep early. - Come home soon. - I'll be back once I'm done. Bye. You're such a liar. You lied to your son. I'm only doing this for his own good. Get with the times, Bro! Don't tell me you want your son to be a lawyer or a doctor. There are a lot more gangsters, junkies and thugs out there. You have arrested so many of them. You should know better. You frequent the hookers too. I don't think that far. I don't know what he'll grow up to be. But I know one thing. Visiting hookers is one thing. Being a father is another. I don't care what kind of nonsense he picks up later in life. As long as I can take care of him... I'm responsible for him. I must filter things out for him. When you become a father, you'll know. It's a pain. They are two different things. Rat Poison Smells good. Let's eat... It's delicious. I'm telling you. The meal you cooked last time was great. It tasted just like my mom's. It's delicious. Don't work at those sleazy places. Cook for me. I'll pay you. You don't have any money. I've sent all my money to my mom. You're crazy. I'm leading my life my way. What's wrong with that? You once said that we're two of a kind. Here, dig in... Come on, eat. Babies are geniuses - Fat Wah! - What's up, Jan? Do you have these songs? Plum Blossom Melodies. Evening Boat Serenade. You're looking for old songs?

I don't even talk to my parents much. I'm the sort of guy... who just wants to have some fun. Why get caught up in it? That's about it. Why take things so seriously? Stop it! I'm doing your laundry! - Why? You did it on purpose! - I didn't mean it... You did, didn't you? You know my mom's letters are in there. - You're so mean! - I didn't do it on purpose! Why are you so mean? My mom's letters. My mom's letters. Fa! What's wrong? Your tummy hurts? Why? Does it have to do with the food from yesterday? But I ate it and I'm okay. Hang in there.

Didn't you tell me they have the will to live? Are you messing with me? We'll do our best. I'm sorry. Jan, the beggar you mentioned... is here with the girl. I'm on the fifth floor at number thirty-seven, Fuk Wah Street. If she wakes up, tell her I'll bring the little girl to see her. Come over here. She just had her first period. Nothing serious. But she has a congenital uterine disorder, hence the heavy bleeding. I've given her some painkillers and tranquillizers. Let her rest. Darn it! Where's the beggar? Where's the beggar?! Watch it! What's wrong with you? Heck. He's fast even with a kid in his arms. I'm telling you, I need to leave now. I can't stay here any longer. Someone's after me. I know where I am. I'm at that abandoned building along Hospital Street. Remember to bring my money with you. Did you think I wouldn't find you? I can find you no matter where you go. Look at you. - You must know something. - No. I told you I'm holding you responsible. You must find my son no matter what! Your son has nothing to do with me! I told you I couldn't help you! Why are you forcing me? You shouldn't have killed Tong! You just wanted your son back. You didn't have to kill him! You thought you wouldn't be in trouble after whacking him? You have to lay low now! I didn't order anyone to kill him! He had so many enemies. Who knows who ordered the hit? You're such an idiot! Think about it. I haven't found my son. Why would I whack him? Use your brain, numbskull! Chong and Tong never got along. I'm going to seek revenge. Tong, go that way. It's a dead-end over here. If the hitman rats you out, you'll still be in trouble. You know what to do. You're a smart kid. Sing, everything okay? I don't need so many men. You can go. It's time for us to take action. Once we kill that beggar to avenge Tong... I can officially take his place. We'll be the strongest gang here! Cheers... South Asians gather and work at the Shum Shui Po area. Most of them are law-abiding individuals. Recently, there has been a surge in crime in the area. Some of these crimes are related to the triads while some are not. For example, the serial robbery that occurred this morning... were committed by three Indians. The police suspect that they may be responsible for the recent robberies... targeting prostitutes as well as home break-ins. Not much is known about these three robbers. They are not linked to any of the local triads. They are armed and dangerous. Please be on the alert. Good stuff. Look at how big our guns are. The police use small guns. Now we can go for the big jobs. We don't need to fear the police. And that includes the triads as well. - We want to make big money! - We'll be rich! We can pay for the hookers! Are you awake? Are you okay? This... You held this book when you slept last night. I could tell you probably like it a lot. I used some scrap paper to fix it for you. Look. I fixed it. Look here. My mom taught me how to do it. She could make a lot of things with just paper and a pair of scissors. - Your mom's really amazing. - That's right... That's what everyone said about her too. That's why I must make more money for her. I know I'm not too clever. Other than my brute strength... and my knowledge with guns, I don't have much. My family is dirt poor. My mom never doted on me. She only made me work for money. I hated her. I didn't shed a tear when she died. I can't go anywhere without money. I don't know who can take me away. I can only depend on myself. I'll leave once I have the money. Right. We can leave together. We can take a plane together. A plane can take us to a place far far away. Where can you go? Anywhere. Who cares? As long as we can make money and not go hungry. We are not the same at all. We are the same. We're both out for money. You need to eat. And I need to eat too. I'll buy the food and you'll cook. You just have to cook as well as my mom. Right? I bet you've never been on a plane. Run! Get up! Let's go! - But you... - Don't worry about me! Run! - What are you doing? - Let go! Let go of me! Let go! What are you doing? Move it! Let go! Go away! Let go of me... Be quiet! Move it! Sing, that beggar is crazy! He has killed everyone else. I have the girl, and the beggar is coming after me! If he catches me, I'll be dead! Come and help me! Okay, I'll send help over. Be quiet! Shut up! - Let go of me! - Be quiet! Be quiet, okay? - This way! Come here! - Let go of me! Let go! Don't touch me! Be quiet! Go away! Let go of him! You guys go down! Okay! You scumbag! You're behind everything! So what? I saw you run over Tong down! You thought you could get away just by wiping off your finger prints? I was the one who cleaned up after you! Where's the beggar? You want to kill the beggar to save your own hide. Are you really after him to avenge Tong's death? Yeah, right! Come on! You've always been a smart guy. We'll help each other in the future! Okay. You want to find him, right? You want to know where the killer is, right? I'll tell you now! Get up! Go! Just leave! Are you okay? You're bleeding very badly. I'm fine. My mom told me I'm as tough as an ox. I told her I want to be as tall and as strong as a tree. So that I could show her the view from the tree top. But my mom said it's no good to be a tree. Because trees get chopped down. It's better to be the moss by the river. We'll live as long as there's light and water. Aren't we two of a kind? We're not the same. You're no moss. You're a flower. Leave now. Go. Go! Go! Quick! Leave... Go! Let him off! He can no longer fight you! He's a good man! Don't kill him! Shut up! You couldn't even kill a beggar by yourself. I've given you your chance, but you blew it. You're too much of a coward to shoot. Since I have to clean up all your messes... I might as well do without you. That's the way of the world. Only the toughest and the most heartless can survive. I thought you were a capable man, but you're just trash. You brought this on yourself. Look, we are rich! Look at the money. Let's lay low. We'll leave once the police are gone. - Do we have men out there? - No, I've never seen them before. Get the bag! You're so careless! Let me get it back. We're armed! Come out! Put down your gun! I said drop your guns! Don't mess with us! Guns down! We'll shoot if you don't drop them! - Brother, go for it! - Kill them all! Stronger fire power wins any day. These people look rich. Grab it... Wait, there's something else. You stay here, wait outside with the money. Come over! Come to me... Hey, don't touch the kid! Come over here! - Come now... be quiet! - Let go of me! It's none of your business. - Be quiet! - Don't... Shut up! Be quiet! Shut up! Stop! Guided by the emerald... the warrior chases after the demon and the girl. The warrior and demon... fought it out in a castle illuminated by the colours of the rainbow. They fought long and hard. Till the sky finally darkened and the sun lost its brilliance. There was nothing the girl could do but stand by and watch. Finally... the warrior raised his sword... and slew the demon. Blood spurted from the demon's neck. The sun began its slow descent. It was a crimson sunset, the colour of blood. And the colours blended as one. I am a cloud in the sky. In your heart, I cast my shadow. Don't be surprised, and do not rejoice. For in an instant, I shall vanish without a trace. It's all right. I am a cloud in the sky. Didn't you want to go to the beach? In your heart, I cast my shadow. Don't be surprised, and do not rejoice. Let's go to the beach. I am a cloud in the sky. We met at sea, in the dark of the night. You on your way, and I on mine. Remember if you will, or, better still, forget... the dazzling brilliance we gave off the night we met. We met at sea, in the dark of the night. You on your way, and I on mine. Remember if you will, or, better still, forget... the dazzling brilliance we gave off the night we met.
