- I was four when our doctor said we should move to Australia to clear up my asthma. He referred us to the Fairbridge Society who offered mum a job there as a teacher. So mum, my brother, my sister and I took off to the other side of the world. But when we got there, to the middle of nowhere, they ripped up our mum's letter of employment, took her away from us and forced her and other screaming mothers onto a bus. And we were left in the blistering heat with hundreds of other kids. Then they put us to work. We were now Wards of the state. To have any chance of getting us back, Mum needed a house and a job. But unemployment was at an all time high, so desperate and with no other options, my shy mother became a stripper. This is the story about how she stole us back, about how we hitchhiked over the Nullarbor, the longest road in the world. About our life on the run from the government and how along the way, she somehow managed to become an Australian icon. - Hi Grandma, it's Indy - And Sisi - And Sunny - We just got batteries. - We now live in Burleigh heads on the Gold Coast. - We have a playroom, a dining room and live in a grand orange mansion and have a huge backyard. Mum has a really good job. She's got quite interesting work clothes She must help lots of people. Sometimes she dresses as a nurse - And other times like Wonder Woman - She's even in the newspaper sometimes. - And I think she might be famous cause everybody stares at her and knows her name. I reckon it must be pretty rainy in England. - Or is it snowing? - Grandma we hitch-hicked from one side of Australia to the other it took two weeks. - And we saw dingoes and kangaroos! Send us a tape back. You can send it to the general post office in Surfers Paradise. - There's a man there named Yusuf who holds our mail. Sunny and I think he puts boot Polish on his head to cover up his bald spot. - Bye grandma - Look Sunny - eighteen days - You tell her - No you Guess what we're having for lunch today? - Double check you finished your homework from yesterday. They'll make you strong - Time for school - You don't have to take us or pick us up It's just down the road - Yes Indy, but it's a big road - But we're big girls now - Okay my big girls, How about if Sisi walks you over? - All right - Yes - Indy and Sunny - Vegemite sandwiches - What happened to your arm? - Ah nothing it's just sports - Mum miss Piggy's had babies! - She must have been pregnant when we found her - Could I name those two Bert and Ernie - Oh yes Sunny, I can't wait to tell grandma - Tell grandma now, hurry - Grandma my mouse has had seven babies - Grandma, grandma mum's got a new job as a meter maid.She feeds coins to the meter so that people shopping won't get a ticket And all she has to wear is a gold bikini - And a sash! - We miss you grandma - We love you grandma - School - We really like it here now - Come on you two - Have a good day Love you - Don't forget to ring that man back about the flat and go to the post office to check if we have any mail.
