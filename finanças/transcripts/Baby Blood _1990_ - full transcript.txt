At the beginning of the world, earth was just a planet... which had just cooled down covered by ugly vegetation... and hideous gargoyles fighting for their food... under the star-filled sky. At the beginning of the world, appeared the first life forms... around the hole of a lost African swamp. And all of them started to reproduce. All except one. Me, who was deprived of one thing.

I remember her Very well. Dark hair with beautiful tits! Why can't guys like me get them? It would be a blast to get some action with them! A weird girl, she seemed exhausted. She was as pale as a cadaver. I tried to have a conversation as I thought she was talking to me. My sister talks to herself, too. She's pregnant. On top of that, she didn't know where to go. "This way... No, that way..." I didn't care because my meter was on. Then she showed me where to stop. I couldn't believe that somebody lived there. - 97 francs. - Are you sure it's here? - Sure I remember. - Of course. Now you go and you forget everything! Shit, man! Get out or I'll the cops! I'm sick of these dogs! Give me my shotgun! Shut up! Shit! What are you gonna do now? Don't make me do that! I can't. Leave me alone, he's not dead. No, he's not dead yet. He didn't want to kill me. He wanted to take me home. I didn't want to kill him. You didn't want to but you did. Don't hurt me. I won't... but you have to do what I say. I can't do what you want. I can't. Look at him, he's dead. I can't stand these dogs anymore! Bianca... I want the blood of the man you killed. I need it to develop myself. I need it for my birth, so you need to feed me properly. I will open your belly, I will tear it from inside... and I will get out of your body if you don't give me the blood. What are you thinking about? See, I can hurt you badly. Cut this man's throat. Go! Take the knife. Take the knife. Take it! Get closer. Stick it deep in his throat. Cut his arteries and veins. Take out his eyeballs. I'm gonna kill these dogs. I'll kill them! Bianca, we need to leave quickly. Bianca, stop. Do you see? Get closer. Slit his throat. You need to feed me so I can grow in your belly. You'll get used to drinking blood. Go on, kill him. What are you doing? Bianca, don't do that. I will never hurt you. Bianca. Get back up! I just want to be born... like everybody else. Like you. You'll give birth to me. I don't want a beast in my belly. But I am not an animal. I talk like a human. I think like a human. Where are we going now? I don't know. I'll have cold coffee, then head to Paris, is it OK? My father was a Portuguese immigrant, a hair dresser, for men, of course. Then, Mr. Romeo, the hair dresser for women, made up with me. I was 16, with an ass plugged for two generations. Bad luck! The Romeos were gay by family tradition. Hey. Are you OK? I loved it, Romeo, Paul, and the others! Then I couldn't it take anymore. My ass was hurting bad! So I took off with Rosie after her transsexual surgery. We had fun. After that I went to the military. I got my driver's license to drive big trucks. You know, the road. The freedom, looking far ahead. And I came back to women. Hi, how are you? - Do I have to come? - No, stay, you're drenched. So Pierrot, fill it up. Sure, but you should look over there. Do you see? You're right, This is good stuff, man. Why did he do that? What? He put his hand on your knee. Because he's sweet. All right. Girls, do you want to see my rig? Calm down! Me trucker, you women, understand? Italian? Portuguese? German? German! Listen, there is a woman in the truck-- OK, Frida, we'll see that later. You are two, there is a woman in the truck-- Yes, Paris, that's it. I'll get rid of her and I'll take you two. I talked to the owner, you can change and dry yourself. And you gonna eat, you are hungry, aren't you? Come on! Get down, come on! Come on! Hurry up, the bath is going to get cold! Come on, hurry up, you two! - Paris? - Sure, I'll be your guide! Come on, hurry up! Keep quiet, quiet! Cool, my man! I love you, dude, but I'm in a hurry! I'll tell you, get up! Come on, come on! Do you understand? These are men's rules.

Yes, I don't know. What do you like in a man? The eyes, a sad look, I like when they are unhappy. Unhappy? Yes. Now that I'm thinking about it... ls a man clever because he knows that he is unhappy? Animals don't know that they are unhappy. Put your seat back. Put your seat back! I can't, it's uncomfortable. Shut up. You're tiring me! I could have a birth defect. No. Why don't you listen to me? You hate me, don't you? Let me drive if you want to be born. When are you going to be born? Soon, if everything goes well. Bianca... Sometimes I am also unhappy. So? Nothing. Bianca... What?

So, soon to be a mommy. You'll see it's a blessing. I bet it's the fist time. I can see it. Let me tell you how it works. Pain, contractions, you're going to push hard... and the head will appear, all withered. You'll push more and he'll gush out... as shiny as a dolphin. Then, you'll hear him scream here close to your belly... still attached to the umbilical cord. You will cut it yourself. Can I make a phone call? Talk to me, tell me something. Talk to me! Stupid kid, he scared me! Will I deliver soon? Yes. So it's your birth soon. Yes. You know that you'll die one day. Yes, I know, but for me it's different. What will you become? I will start to live. To begin with, I will go back to my first natural element. What's that? The sea. Does it hurt? It's bearable. How will you get to the sea? We'll see. I shouldn't have left the circus. You were beaten, fucked-- do you regret that? Yes. So you talk to him, too! We're gonna find a solution good for both of us. I won't force you to take me to the sea... but you find me some blood. I need some energy. Can't you see I'm exhausted! What am I going to do if you can't feed me? You're gonna die! You're gonna dry up on the curb-- Don't talk to me like that! You don't have the right! I don't want to leave you. I want to stay with you forever. Stop please! Feed me one last time. What can I do? What can I do? Look over there. - Please Madam? - No, I don't have time. - Just a few minutes. - Leave me alone you thugs!! But madam, stop please! Bam! Bam! Bam! You're dead! Give me that right now! Now go home! And hurry up! Ah kids! - 3 liters is nothing. - No, more than that-- - You aren't pushy enough. - But you see-- I know it's not easy, but you didn't insist, wait and see. No, not in your condition-- What's your condition now, asshole! Everybody out! Now! I said out! I want some blood! Give me some blood, quick! Go away! Are you OK? Yes I don't feel good. Your blood, asshole! Thank you. What are you thinking? Where are we going? To the sea. My bus is leaving! My bus! My bus! You fuck, come back! Bianca, are you sleeping? No. Why did you tell me that the sea is your first element? Because after that I will evolve. I will come out of the water to crawl on the ground. I will grow and develop. And after that? After that, I will replace the human kind. When? In sixty billion years. I will miss you. A lot. Hey dickhead, this guy is cooked! Call me that one more time and I'll cut your balls off! Look in the corner, the fat one is still alive. Put it in the rails, moron! Go to hell, loser! Speed it up, fucker! Show me some respect, will you? You didn't even put the blanket on her. - Did Gauthier hire you? - Yeah. What a freak he is! You can stop gecko's dick, she's dead. Go fuck yourself. Bianca? It's all dark around me. I don't feel anything anymore. Your temperature is dropping. What's going on? Are you leaving? I can't let you die. Come back, Bianca. Come back! Are you jerking off or what?

So this guy put an injection system-- What? No, a pneumatic one. But are you really so stupid? Why did I choose you as a partner? You don't understand anything, you nerd! Yes, have a good trip. Right, get lost. So you need to fight, you make your own decision. Wait! May I help you? No. Where do you go? What? We are going to Le Havre. Sunday, we play against the British. - Can I come? - You want to travel with these guys? Can I get in? All right, but let them sleep! Let's hit the road! - What are you looking for? - Nothing. - I can help you. - Don't touch me. - What's that? - Stop it. - Don't touch me! - Come in the back. - Leave me alone! - Let's have some fun. Be nice with me, all right! - Stop it! - I'm a nice guy. - What's your name? - What's going on, Jackie? A chick got on the bus! In the bus? A chick? I told you not to wake them up.
