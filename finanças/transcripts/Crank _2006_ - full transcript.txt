Are we spinning yet? All right, nice. Chelios! How we doing, baby? And you never call me no more? Now, come on, what is that? Where's the love? Now, how are you feeling? Because I have to guess, maybe you're feeling like shit right about now? Now you can't... You can't move too good, huh? You can't breathe too good. What the hell is the matter with you, dude? Wait, wait, wait, wait! What is this? Oh, fuck. Can you guess what this is? I bet you can, Chelios. Hold on. Check this out. This... Oh, this is plain sick, man! I must be the motherfucking genius of sick, you know? Poison Chev Chelios in his sleep? That's like some Shakespeare or some shit. Damn, you knocked this dude out pretty good. About to get you a spot on the Dodgers, son. Yeah. Maybe you don't understand what just happened. I just fucking killed you. You try not to embarrass yourself, because you're on Candid Camera. What is this shit right here I gave you? This is some high-tech, sci-fi, Chinese synthetic bullshit! I don't exactly know what the fuck is in this shit, dude. All I know is that once this shit has binded with your blood cells, you're fucked. And baby, believe me, it's done binded. Yeah, you got yourself about an hour, max. Tick-tock. This shit has been real. You probably should've thought twice before you whacked Don Kim. You're experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight right about now, ain't you? You know, I thought so. Now, you have yourself a nice death. Asshole. You like that, huh? Home run. Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called, but I'm not here. Can you leave a message? Unless you're trying to sell something, because I'm not interested. But if you're not, then just... Oh, wait! Time's up. Get a cell phone, honey. Please? Come on, come on, come on. - Dr. Miles' office. May I help you? - Yeah, let me speak to him. I'm sorry, but the doctor isn't in right now. May I take a message? Well, where is he? - I beg your pardon, sir? - Where the fuck is he? No. Yeah. Where you from? I don't know, sir. This is his answering service. Jesus fucking Christ. - Would you like for me to have him paged? - Yeah, fine. Could you please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour. You got that? - Could you spell that for me? - Yeah, D-E-A-D. Chelios. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Hello. - Kaylo, my man. Where were you last night? - Oh, what's up, Chev? - I said, where were you last night? I... Yeah, yeah, well, you want to know what I was doing? - What? - Getting killed, you plum. - What? - Yeah, you heard me. - Ricky fucking Verona. - Ricky Verona? I mean, who'd have thought that little bitch would have the stones to come and whack me in my own crib? I mean, it's inconceivable. - And yet, here we are. - Where are we? I'm dead, and you're simple. Now, you listen to me. You put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him, you call me. - You understand that? - I... I'm going to get that little fucker if it's the last thing I do. It may actually be the last thing I do. - You understand that? - Ricky Verona. - Copy me on that, Kaylo? - Yeah! Find him! - Hey, man! - Get up! What the fuck you doing? What the fuck you doing? Where am I going? - Fuck you, man. - Chevy! Man, the bathroom don't work, brother. What you doing? - Yo, Chevy, what the... - Where's Verona? Hey, turd, I'm talking. What are we talking about? - Don't fuck with me! - Okay. Nobody's fucking with you, man. - Just calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down, motherfucker! - What the fuck, man? - Orlando, you all right? Hey! There's a white nigga with a gun up in here. Just be still, motherfuckers! Now, you see that? You see that? I'm trying to help you here, man. Look, I gotta find Ricky Verona. Why the fuck would I know where Ricky Verona is? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is. Or I'm going to blow your brains through the fucking toilet! Come on, man! I'm going to fucking kill him! Put your guns down. The white man is cool. Hey! The white man is cool! Y'all like them Somalia niggas. Now, look, Chevy came here because he has something he would like to discuss. And we going to discuss this shit in a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point that you were trying to make. - Where's Verona? - Okay. I'm not affiliated with Ricky Verona. You pulled the Anselmo job together. Don't try to fucking bullshit me! Easy! Easy! Easy! All right? Look, clearly you're operating under a false pretense, all right? Because Ricky Verona and myself did not pull the Anselmo job together. In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona still owes me $7,500. - Not how I heard it. - Yeah, but that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So, you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is, because if I knew where Ricky Verona was I'd probably be there right now, beating the Gucci off his ass. All right. All right. That's what I'm talking about. That's almost civilized. Shit, dude, what's the matter with you? Look, just give me some coke, okay? You got any coke? Okay, so now you're just going to just come up in here and insult me. Come on, I don't have time! Just give me something. - I'm really dying here. - I can see that. You don't understand. I'm really fucking dying! You saying this is medicinal-use coke? Is that what you're saying? That's right. Well? - What? - The shit ain't free, nigga. That's enough. Here. What, you gonna do the shit right here? Chevy, come on, man! Oh, God. Chevy. - Oh, what the... - Oh, that's good. - Oh, that's good. - That's good, right? Why you looking for Verona anyway, man? Seems like some Chinese assholes hired him to kill me. So this is about the Don Kim situation. - What do you know about it? - I know you pulled the trigger. Of course I pulled the trigger. Why wouldn't I pull the fucking trigger? Well... Yo, Chelios. You good? - This shit ain't working. - I beg your pardon? I think I know what I have to do. Well, Chev. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. - What is it you gotta do? - I'm gonna kick some black ass. What? Oh, shit! There he goes again. Who wants white meat? - Doc? - What's up, Doc? You fucking motherfucker! Why ain't you dead yet, man? What the fuck you doing out there? Coming for you, asshole, fucking believe me! Yo, whatever, dude. I'll be waiting for you. You ain't gonna make it though, motherfucker. Look, I just thought you should know that I'm all about hooking up with that little mystery girl that you been banging. Oh, yeah, I know about that shit. Soon as your ass is underground. I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. What, and then you're going to rape my grandmother? Blah, blah, fucking blah. Now listen to me, you little mug. What do you think Carlito's going to do when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history. - Driver, pull over. - Fuck! Great. You're talking about Carlito? That's some fucking funny shit, because me and Carlito, man, we're boys now. That's right. We're tight. You haven't been tight since your brother fucked you in third grade. That's snappy. But I did you pretty good, though, didn't I, Chelios? - You can admit it. - Yeah, we'll see. - Pull over! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what the best part about it is? Sorry, must go. Bye-bye. Dr. Miles. Fuck you for that, Doc. What took you so long? - Jesus Christ. - I'm sorry, Chevy. I just got the message. Okay, okay, okay, forget it. Listen. I'm dying. I've been poisoned with some kind of Chinese synthetic shit. What? Yeah, you gotta fucking do something for me, Doc. - I'm telling you now. - What are your symptoms? It's like I'm slowing down. You know, I'm caught in a tar pit. - Blurred vision? - Yeah. - Dizzy? - Sure. - Any pain in your chest? - Not really. Actually, I'm feeling pretty good right now. What are you doing? Driving through a mall. Cops chasing me. The flow of adrenaline's what's keeping you alive. I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Doc. You got to keep moving, Chevy. Explain. If I'm right, they gave you the Beijing cocktail. It's very nasty shit. It works on the adrenal gland, blocks its receptors. The only thing you can do to slow it down at all is to keep the flow of adrenaline constant. Meaning, if you stop, you die. Hang on. Jesus, what was... Are you there? Are you okay? - What'd you say, Doc? - If you stop, you die. That's what I'm trying to do. Keep moving. Keep the blood pumping. Chevy, you there? Chevy? Every time I slow down, it's... It's like my veins start to rust. - Have you taken anything? - A couple of grams of coke. Well, that's a start, huh, Chevy? Look, I'll be in LA in about an hour. I'll call you as soon as I get there, but do not stop moving. Keep yourself pumped up. Taxi! Yo, yo, yo, yo! - Go! - Where we go? Just drive! Make a right. - Where do you want to go, man? - Right. - Oh, shit. - Go right! - Okay! Yes! - Go fucking right! Crank the music. Crank it! Pull over. Pull over. Thanks, mate. Don't go anywhere. I'll be back in one minute. Okay, cowboy. Hey, buddy! You move, you die. Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called, but I'm not here. Fuck! - Where do you want to go, man? - Beverly Hills. - Chevy. - Hey, boss. Something urgent's come up. So I've heard. Word travels fast. Listen, Carlito. I need your help. I don't have a lot of time. No. Not much. You gotta find an antidote or something. - What's the matter? - The shit they gave you. It's the Chinese shit. There is no antidote. - What, that's it? - Honestly, you should be dead already. It's a miracle. - A miracle? - We give that shit to horses. You don't have to be so damn fucking cool about it! What do you expect me to do, hmm? Tell me you're going to find that punk Verona and his whole fucking crew and feed them to a cage of wolverines. What is this? - What, are you boys now or something? - Verona? That's a small-time punk. But that's not to say there isn't an opportunity here. Opportunity? Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev. Maybe this makes up for the Don Kim hit, which was... - Perhaps ill-advised. - Ill-advised? The heat from Hong Kong has been much more than we anticipated. Well, that's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad to know that my death can be of some fucking use to you. - Don't be difficult. - I'm not being difficult. I don't know if you'd noticed, but I'm having a difficult fucking day, brother! I'm out of here. You're not getting in my cab wet. I just gave you $200 to wait for three minutes. You're not getting in my car. No way! Yeah, you're right. I'm not getting in your cab. Al-Qaeda! Al-Qaeda! I love America! I love Bush! - Yeah. - Hey, Chev. - My flight's been delayed. - Shit. No, no, it's all right. Relax. I mean, don't relax. Listen to me. That shit that they gave you is cutting off your adrenaline. Excitement, fear, danger. It causes your body to manufacture a chemical called ephedrine. Now, what these guys have done is introduce an inhibitor to your system. For fuck's sake! Dude, your only chance is to massively increase the level of ephedrine in your body to force out the inhibitors. You got to get to the emergency room. Get yourself some epinephrine. It's an artificial adrenaline. It comes in 10-milligram syringes. The shit's potent, so don't overdo it. Probably a fifth of an injection will do. Chevy, did you get that? - Did you get that, Chevy? - Yeah, epi-something, yeah. Nephrine, man. Okay, okay, okay, I've got it. I gotta go. I'll call you when I get there. - Yeah. - Chev? Yeah. What is it? Hello? Oh, fuck. Motherfuck! - Chev? - Yes! Fuck! I just saw Verona's brother walk into the Prince. Interesting. The Prince. Yeah. I was just down here getting a taco and he just walked right in, two minutes ago. - Where are you now? - I'm across the street, getting a taco. - Where are you? - I'm there. Meet me on 7th and Catalina. Is he in there now? Did anyone go in with him? Right, wait here. How'd you like that one, tough guy? How fricking awesome was that? Well, well, well. You feel like talking to me, do you? Where's your fucking brother? Doing your mother like a fucking whore, you bitch! Nice. Wonder how many steaks I could carve out of you. You die, motherfucker. Don't fuck with me, ese. What, a rolling pin, you little punk? What, you want to dance with me, motherfucker? I'll fuck you up. Jesus. Nothing's easy. Want to hold hands? Don't stop, baby. Hey, talk to me, bro. Hey, Ricky. What do you think about sucking me off? You in the mood? Maybe let me lick your ass or something? Who is this? Shit. Chelios? - Is this fucking Chelios? - That's right, bro. Want to guess how I got your brother's cell phone? I can tell you have it all figured out. Looks like you should have cut me up when you had the chance. I'm having a little trouble hearing you, Ricky. Are you experiencing a little 20/20 hindsight? You're supposed to be fucking dead! You know, I kind of like that shit you put in me. Can you get me some more? - I'm gonna... - Oh, I know. I know. I know. Hey. What's this? A necklace. - You guys really are faggots, aren't you? - You motherfucker! You fucking motherfucker! My grandfather gave that medallion to my father, and then he... Fuck! Fuck you, man. You take that thing and you shove it up your ass. No, thanks. You know, I believe I'll hang on to it. Looks like you'll have to come and find me after all. Fucked up that you killed your own brother. - You... - Out. What was that shit? Epi... Was it 10 milligrams? Good work, Kaylo. Puta. Asshole! No need to push. I'm looking for something starts with "E". - England? - Very funny. No. Some kind of artificial adrenaline. - Artificial adrenaline. - Yeah. Got heart problems. - Epinephrine. - Yes! Epinephrine. I love you. Epinephrine. I can't give you epinephrine. Why? Just a minute. What do you mean you... - What is this shit? - Nasal spray. - Fucking miserable bitch. What? - Nasal spray. It's got epinephrine in it. It'll get you tweaked, man. - Are you sure that's the guy? - Yes. This room's clear. Could anyone speaking Korean please come to ER? Anyone speaking Korean please come to ER. Yo, yo, yo. Yo! Dude, stop! Stop! Hey, jerk off! Coming through! I know you motherfuckers have epinephrine! Clear the hallway! Corner! Are you all right, sir? - I'm having a really bad day. - Oh, shit! Tell me you've got epinephrine on this fucking cart. You all right? I said, tell me you've got epinephrine on the cart, motherfucker! I don't know! I could check. All right. Okay. - Get back! - Take it easy. - You understand fucking English? I said... - I understand English. I just don't know which one of these drawers it's in. Come on! Move! Give me the fucking epinephrine! - All right! - Around the corner! I don't know where it is, man! What is this, a rest home? What are you doing back there? - Hurry up! - He's in shock! - Get back! - We can't treat you without insurance. Well? I don't know if I have it. Give me a second here. I'm looking. Drop the weapon now! What the fuck? Where the fuck is it? My cart. What the hell? - What? - My cart! Yeah, yeah. Drop your weapon now! What is this? What the hell do you think you're doing? - This is a hospital. - Shut up. You! Get me the epinephrine. Don't even think about it! Albuterol, skelaxin, Nexium, chlortab... Epinephrine! Here it is. I got it. - Here you go. - Give me that shit. - Asshole. - I'm not going to tell you again. All right. Just be quiet. Juice me. Juice? Do it. - All right. - Come on! Okay, okay. I haven't got all day. Okay. I need both of them to... Give it to me. One... Two... Clear. Get the fuck down! How much of this stuff did he say to take? - Chevy? - Yeah? Hey, we're in the air, man. - Did you get that stuff I told you to get? - Got it. - Did you take it? - Took it. You took the whole goddamn thing, didn't you? - Yep. - I said a fifth of a syringe. - That shit's going to kill you. - Right. - Your chest on fire? - Check. - But you're cold. - Check. - And you got a steel hard-on, don't you? - Let me check. - Check. - Yeah, well, that's the stimulation of your blood vessels. Your urinary sphincter's as tight as a knot right now. You couldn't piss to save your life. Urinary sphincter. Check. Maybe you can get some Vicodin. - You still at that hospital? - Negative. - Could you get some grass? I don't know. - Check. That shit will be out of your system in 30 minutes if it doesn't kill you first. This flight phone's costing me a fortune. We'll be in LA in 20 minutes. - I'll call you when we land. - Copy. Hey, Chevy? You're a good dude. Been nice knowing you. Copy. Out. Some medical emergency. Police have declined to release the name of the Los Angeles man they say is still at large on a citywide rampage that has left one man dead, dozens injured and hundreds of thousands of dollars of property damage in its smoking, bloody wake. However, KTLA News has learned the suspect is a professional killer with ties to organized crime and an extensive police record. He is considered armed and highly dangerous. We want to get you back to our regularly scheduled programming, but keep it tuned right here to KTLA for continuing coverage of this bizarre story as it unfolds. So what you're saying, Mark, is that next to olives, onions, lemons, and limes... Oh, shit! Look, take it easy, mister. Get back, pig! Just give me the... Come on, then. Let's see you run, piggy. Come on, piggy. Give me the gun back. Let's just talk this over. Hey, you want it? There! Honey, let's go! Be careful. We'll get some help, all right? Yeah. Hey, did you try to call? You've been home all day? I was sleeping in. You were sleeping in? That's great, Eve. Super great. You all rested now? Glad to hear it. Listen... I've been fatally poisoned. There's probably a psychopath heading over there to torture and kill you as we speak, but don't bother getting out of bed. I'll be there in a flash. Maybe you can fry me up a waffle or something, okay? Sure. Yeah, come on over. I'll be here. Right. You'll be there. - Okay. - Bye. So let's go get the bitch. Come on! Please! All right! All right! Jesus. Oh, my God. Is this your new look or something? - Yeah. You into it? - It's gross. Are you looking for my other boyfriend? Yes! - You haven't turned on the TV today, right? - No, why? Didn't think so. Come on. We're leaving. What are you talking about? Don't be such a freak. Honey. Get dressed. Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you change the clock on my microwave? I never changed it back. - What? - The microwave. Can you change the clock? 'Cause the daylight savings time, and I never changed it back. - The microwave? - Yes. Hey, listen. I brought you some flowers. They got fucked up on the way over here. That's sweet. Are you okay? You look like you're on drugs or something. Listen. You love me, yeah? Yes. - Then I need you to do something for me. - What? What's wrong? I need you to put some clothes on, sweetheart, and come with me right now. - Yeah? - No. - I'll change the clock on the microwave. - Okay. - Yeah? - All right. The shit's wearing off. Oh, darn. I forgot. The waffle iron is on if you want to make one. Great. Great. You're so stressed out. - Do you want some pot or something? - Yeah! No! Ready. What's the matter? It's all right. Burned my hand. - Oh, my God! Let me see. - Let's go, Eve. Don't worry about it. - No, no, no, no, no! - Eve! I'm sorry. That was completely uncalled-for. Can we just... Fine. Parked at the back. - Darn! That thing. - What thing? - The waffle thing. I gotta turn it off. - Come on. Hello? Hello? All right. Very funny. God, I hate that. You trying to burn the building down? - Sorry, honey. - Oh, jeez! Nice one. Oh, there's my Tiger Balm. I swear to God, Chev. I don't know what you're on these days, but it is not working for you. My hand cream. That's where you went. Chev, can I have some help here? Where's your car? My car. Actually, I took a cab. This isn't going to be... This isn't going to be easy, as they say. Oh, fuck it. All right. Here it is. Sorry. You know I told you I was a video game programmer. - Yeah. - Well, that was a lie. Actually... I kill people. Professional hit man. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate. Last night was a job like 100 others. A high-dollar hit, nothing special. The triads from Hong Kong had been moving in on the local drug cartels for the last six months. My target was their number-one man in Los Angeles. Don Kim. Well? What are you waiting for? Then, from out of nowhere, this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range. Congratulations. - Did I win something? - Your life, jackass. A hundred grand wants you dead, so, sooner or later, it's going to happen. But I'm not doing it. I see. Instead, you're going to do something for me. You're going to get out of town. Disappear. I don't care where you go, I don't care what you do, so long as you're invisible for 48 hours. That's all I ask. Forty-eight hours? Or, if you prefer, we can do it the other way. The way where I go to work and you meet Buddha. See, I... I quit. I quit the business, for you. - For me? - Yeah. I figured I'd call you that night, tell you everything. You understand? We get on a plane together and leave all this shit behind. Never come back. Pretty crazy, huh? You are so weird. So are we going on a trip? Well... I might be going on a trip, but you're not coming with me. Please, baby, please! Mob hits, Chev? Chinese poison? Do you know how ridiculous you sound? If you're going to break up with me, at least you can tell me the truth. Chev? Chev? What's the matter with you? - Wait a minute. Do you trust me? - No. - Make love to me. - What? - Come on, I think it'll help. - Help what? Are you kidding? Get off me. - Take your clothes off. - No! No! You always say you want to be more spontaneous. You're insane. You're like an adrenaline junkie with no soul. Save me, Eve. Save my life. Stop it! Fuck. I'm sorry. Oh, my God, are you okay? Are you okay? No. No! Enough. Shit! Get off! Get off! Get off! You filthy animal. Take me right here. In front of everyone. That's it. Come on! Do it! What are you waiting for? - Jesus! - Come on! I'm trying! Shush, Eve! Oh, God, now you can't get it up? For God's sake. Come on! Get it up! I'll fucking get it up! Jesus! - God damn it, Chev! - Shut up! I'm alive! I'm alive! I'm alive, you motherfuckers! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Shit. Yeah? What are you doing? I've got Verona. Kaylo? I've got Verona, man. - What? - No shit. Where are you? Don Kim's shirt factory. I'm upstairs. What's the matter with you? - Fifth and Alameda? - Yeah. Who's at Fifth and Alameda? Listen to me. You don't let that motherfucker out of your sight. You hear me? With you in 10 minutes. You got it? - Yeah, Chev. - Out. Listen, honey, I gotta go. I'll call you! Oh, God, what are you looking at? Hey, man, what's the matter with you? You a crackhead? Right. Look, just step on it, all right? You're not gonna die in my cab, crackhead. I got something for you. You take this Haitian shit, crackhead. This shit right here is some hardcore shit. It's made from plant shit. Hey, what are you laughing at? Look at this. You see that? That's what a man look like, crackhead. That's power. Now look at you. What the hell? Yeah? It tastes like ass. Well, that's right, devil. You wait. - Shut the fuck up! - No! No! - Get the fuck up there! - No! Whoomp! There it is. Fuck him. We're here. - What'd you say was in this stuff? - I told you, it's hardcore. It'll be $5.55. It's all you, man. Have a nice day, devil. This is fucked. Where's he going? Okay, okay. How the fuck you gonna call me, talking shit, homey, huh? I'll smack the hell out of you, homeboy. I don't know where he at. I ain't baby-sitting the motherfucker. Fucking call me, talking shit. Shit. I'm doing my job! I'm doing my shit! I'm out here just chilling, doing what I do. I'm on a rooftop, mother... Hey, whoa, Chevy, Chevy, what's up, dawg? Everything all right? You chilling? You good? - What a fucking coincidence. - What you talking about, man? What are you doing? Waiting for a bus? No, no, actually, I thought maybe a helicopter would come pick me up... - What the fuck is this? - What's what? What, are you working for the Chinese now? The Chinese? Come on, man, you crazy? You know I wouldn't do that to you, man. I am crazy. Where's Kaylo? Okay, ding. Time's up. What you mean, ding? What you mean, ding? What you mean... Where is that motherfucker? Chev. What the fuck is this? Chev, baby, take it easy. Oh, you mean like this? Now you tell me where that little toe-rag motherfucker is. Verona. Verona's got nothing to do with this. What? Don Carlos wants you off the streets. Carlito. You've totally lost your shit, dawg. You're all over TV. Destroying property, making unauthorized hits. You're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment. You're telling me Carlito ordered this? Look, don't worry about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is find some nice, dark, quiet place, and just die. Just die? What, do you think I've got cunt written on my forehead? Maybe you're right. - We all gotta die sometime, right? - Yeah. We all gotta die sometime. So just die. What the... Ow, my fucking ass! - You got shot! - Motherfuck! Jesus. Eve, move. You! Asshole! What you want? Don't talk to him like that! My boyfriend kills people! Nice. Come on. I had to see if you were telling the truth. Come on. No, wait! Now come on. Oh, God! Oh, damn it! I forgot to take my birth control pills. - What? - Yeah. - Where are the keys? - Chev. - Keys. Eve, the keys. - Here. - Come on, come on! - My stuff! All my stuff! - You weren't lying. - Welcome to my life. No, I mean... - That you would give it all up for me. - Yeah. - And the other part? - The poison? Yeah, that's true too. Then that means... Pretty much, Eve. How can we stop it? Adrenaline's the only thing that slows it down. - So, when we were in Chinatown... - Yeah. Sorry. - Eve, what are you doing? - This'll get you going. What? - Come on. Let's finish what you started. - Oh, boy. Oh, that's it. That's really working for me. - You like that? - Stay down! Motherfuck! Jesus. Yeah, that's it, baby. Just a little more. Stay down, Eve. Oh, Jesus. You're so big. Oh, my God. Just a touch... What's the matter? So you can fall asleep like you always do? I don't think so. Jesus, fuck! Are they really... They're dead. How can you do that? I told you, baby. I quit. Yeah? Chev. Holy shit, I've been trying to get a hold of you for half an hour. - Where the fuck have you been? - At my office. - Can you make it over here? - Sure. Why not? Chocolate, what's this fucking receipt from Gold Foods Market for $254? Snacks. I owe you again, Doc. Chevy, you're my best customer. What is this stuff? Synthetic ephedrine diluted with some saline. Feels sort of good. Yeah, well, I got a little meth in there too, so that's the endorphins you're feeling running to your brain. Wait a minute. What, so I'm not better? Fuck, no, you're not better. You're in such shit shape, it's stunning. I can't believe your heart's still beating. This shit should be in a fucking medical journal. So what are you gonna do? The solution I'm giving you is acting as a competing inhibitor, meaning that it's pushing the poison out of your receptors and replacing it with a chemical. Now, that's just a temporary fix. - Then what? - You're fucked. I could put you on life-support, Chev, and string this out for a few days. But you're gonna go into a coma at some point. Does she know? Why don't you let me load you up with something? You can go out in a beautiful dream. A dream? Can I do that for you? No, no. That's not what I want. What do you want? One hour. I want one hour. Give me a fucking break. And so the wild rampage that began at 9:00 a.m. this morning in west Los Angeles continues with the mysterious suspect still at large. Yo, maybe we should have given him more of that Chinese shit. You think? Dude, it's him. - What's up, corpse? - Bonjour, douche bag. I thought you might be interested in a little deal. Oh, you want to... Are you a dealer? Is that what you are now? Don't you worry about what I am. - Listen, I want the antidote. - Oh, the antidote. That's right, the antidote. What are you prepared to give me, asshole? How about the jewelry I got off that faggot brother of yours, you fucking cocksucker? - Don't pop a blood vessel, you little penis. - All right. - You like that deal, do you? - Yeah, whatever. I'll be at the downtown Lint in 20 minutes. - You know the spot? - Yeah, I know it. Well, don't be late, or I'll trade this thing to some whore for a fucking handjob. Look, I said I'll fucking be... I'll fucking be there, goddamn it! See you later, sunshine. Yo, it's Verona. You're not gonna believe this call I just got. It's going to be all right, baby. But you said... I know. Things have changed. There's an antidote. I can make a deal for it, but I gotta go alone. - I'm scared. - Of course. But you'll be safe now. And I'll be back. You promise? I promise. What's happening, brother? Where did I go wrong? Did you fucking just say something? It's like talking to the wall. Mom? I'm amazed you remember you have a mother. Mom, please. I haven't got time for this. You got no time, period. Orlando? You a persistent motherfucker, Chev Chelios. I'll give you that. They pop you and you just keep getting up? I'm the Terminator. You was that, maybe, but there's a new gun in town. You know, I don't get it. Why didn't you just cut me up alive when you had the chance? Too easy, motherfucker. Look at you. Bipolar, sadomasochistic tendencies. Adrenaline junkie. Addicted to violence. Carving up a guy like that while he screams in his own blood and excrement, would be like a gift. A warrior's death. Hell, you'd probably get off on it. Who the hell are you, anyway? I think I'm starting to figure it out. Well, better late than never. You know you're gonna die up there. Yeah. Maybe. But I'm taking you with me. Some pills, Doc. - Chelios. - Hello, girls. Hold up. Give me the piece. Now, isn't that a fucking picture? Chelios, what a fucking nightmare you are. No shit. Why don't you sit down? Whoa, wait a minute. You pat him down again. I know he's carrying something. Let me see that. Motherfuck. It's clever. - What is this, an insulin pump? - Basically. What the fuck is insulin, man? - Ephedrine, right? - Yeah. You're very resourceful. - Found a new master, little bitch, is that it? - I'm nobody's little bitch. We'll see what kind of a bitch you are when Carlito hires you for half what he used to pay me - and you take it. - That's enough. You'll probably throw boss a nice little reach-around just to show him what a good little bitch you are. You can't fucking say that! I'm nobody's little bitch! You fucking hear me? And he'll fucking pay me what I tell him to pay. I said that's enough! Now sit down! It's been a long fucking day. But in the end you have to admit, it all works out quite nicely. Don Kim gets his bullet, thanks to you, and Hong Kong gets a goat to take the fall. Please understand, Chev. It's truly nothing personal. You speak for yourself. That what I think it is? It's the Chinese shit. Hold him down. Not so fast, motherfucker. He's gone dipsy-doodle, yo. Yeah, whatever, psycho. I'm afraid the Houdini act is over, my friend. Our father, who art in heaven... Shut up, Verona! So this is how it is. It's Don Kim! He's supposed to be dead! Presto. Go, go, go, go, go! Police have moved to surround the downtown boutique hotel Lint, where the unidentified madman behind today's mayhem is believed to be holed up and making a desperate last stand. Local officials have confirmed gunfire on the sun deck. Our news chopper will be bringing live, uncensored coverage from above the hotel momentarily. Again, this coverage is live and uncensored, so if you have any small children present, you may want to have them leave the room. Get me out of here now! - I'll kill you for this, Chelios! - Too late! Look out! Thanks, boss. Let's get the fuck out of here, now! Let's go! Present from Kaylo. Now what? Now you say shit! Where the fuck were you? Who's the bitch now? No, no! You fly, motherfucker! Motherfucking fly! You're dead! Oh, my God. You're dead! Dead! You're dead, motherfucker! Told you I'd kill you, you little bitch! Hey, this is Eve. I'm glad you called, but I'm not here. Can you leave a message? Unless you're trying to sell something, because I'm not interested. But if you're not, then just... Oh, wait! Time's up. Hey, doll. Looks like I let you down again. Seems like all my life, I've just been going, going, going. I wish I'd taken more time to stop and smell the roses, so to speak. Well, I guess it's too late for that now. You were the greatest, baby.
