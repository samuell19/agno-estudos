Killing Romance Oh! There you are! Hello! Welcome to another episode of Debbie's Reading Bus. Today, I have a very special tale from the far far east. It's called 'Killing Romance'. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful lady in a country called Korea. Hwang Yeo-rae was her name. She became a Guinness Book of World Record holder after she drank 1.2 liters of LallaTen in 4.32 seconds. Quantity Over Quality Soft Drink, Drink LallaTen! LallaTen Since then, she was everywhere. Try MC Square for a concentration boost. For Hard-working Students - MC Square Sweat Rash Traditional French Parka Be careful of sweat rash People called it 'Yeo-rae-ism.' For 11 years, she had no rest. World's Greatest Paradise - Qualla Island She got tired, and shed a tear without any reason. But she smiled again. What will your next role be? I want to play a cold-hearted, strong female warrior. She even saved the universe in the most expensive movie ever made. You must protect Korea. If I don't come forth now, a catastrophe will hit Korea. What the hell! The movie flopped, but it made so many people laugh. Her acting was awful If I don't come forth now, a catastrophe will hit Korea. Protect Korea! Yeo-rae. Halla Mountain 'Halla Mountain'. It's Director Kim's new film! People all hate me. Don't mind them. You did great! No one would have done better I want to take a break! I don't want any of this. No more! Stop... She had been told what to do by people. But for the first time, she made a decision of her own. Qualla... Qualla... Come to Qualla Island To go to a beautiful island in the South Pacific called... Qualla! Manager Oh, is this really Floria Hotel? Wait, that's my stuff... You jerks! Hey! Stop right there! That's when it happened. The wind stops. The sun shines. And the man appeared before her like fate. Qualla language Neck chop! Neck chop! Neck chop! Swallow neck chop! Neck chop! Reverse chop! Hammer fist! They fell like leaves with his powerful punch. Jonathan Na was his name. He was an environmentalist. Animal rights activist. And global real estate developer. Are you Korean? Yes, I'm Hwang Yeo-rae. Oh, Hwang Yeo-rae! 'Fang Yeo Rae' means 'jerk' over here. Jonathan came into Yeo-rae's life like the prince who found Cinderella's shoes. This is my car. What a long car... Oh my gosh! He sang her a happy song. ♪ I never forgot about you ♪ ♪ I thought about you all the time ♪ ♪ But you forgot about me ♪ ♪ Tears falling off my ♪ ♪ eyes, what a betrayal ♪ Wow, bean stew! One day, he proposed to her. 7 Years Later Qualla Island Korea After 7 years... They came back to Korea. Honey, do you like our new place? Ow! Yes! Good! How long are we going to stay here? Maybe a month? Honey, come on! Come on! Why the long face? That's it. It's good! Smiling completes your beauty. I have to go now. Get some rest. Susans! Yes, Congressman! It's me, Jonathan. Of course. Oh, wait! I almost forgot. There was a young man named Kim Bum-woo. He was a Sa-soo-saeng. *Sa-soo-saeng: who prepare for college for extra 4 years now. All his family members had graduated from Seoul University. Except for Bum-woo. I hope Seoul University accepts him this time. We were all accepted. Why is he so stupid? I pretend that I don't have a brother. I tell people he's in the military. Stop it, he has a test today. Bum-woo, do well this time. Is it two? Three? - Is it four? - Time's up. - Just ten seconds! - Time's up. Soon-to-be Seoul University students... Seoul University sign! Hard work never betrays us! - What? - Hard work never betrays us! Seoul U! I know, but not today. What? I'm sorry to vent on you. I'm a bit upset right now. Is he talking to a cat? It's his fourth year. He talks to animals now. We shouldn't become like him. Stop talking to that cat. Go away. How was the test? I'm screwed. It was four...

Shall I? Yeo! Rae! Yeo-rae The light's green now. Let's go. Okay. - Ms. Yeo-rae, go get it! - Get it! Get it! I haven't worked in a long time. This feels a little strange.

Thank you, everyone. Jon, I have something to tell you. Hmm? I met the director of 'Becoming a Star' today. Become what? I want to do this film. I want to make a comeback with this project. So... Not returning to Qualla? Filming will only take 6 months, - so... - How strange. Didn't Director Song call you? Well, this is awkward. - Hello? - Director Song, this is Jonathan. Yes. My wife doesn't know what's going on with the film. I was just about to call her. She's right next to me. I'll let you talk to her. Director Song?

They're one-of-a-kind bags from Paris. What have you done? It was business. I invested. On one condition. You're a terrible actress. They shouldn't cast you. You even have hallucinations, manic depression and paranoia. Honey, don't make that face. Do you really want people to ridicule you again? Huh? You're so happy that you're bored. You need to listen to me. I never forgot... Wow. - I thought about you... - Don't touch me. I'm not happy. Wow. Yeo-rae, stop right now. What do you think you're doing? Who are you to decide whether I'm happy or not? Are you me? I'm me! Only I know whether I'm happy or not! I'm not happy. I can't do this anymore. I feel like dying. I want a divorce! Divorce! Divorce! Divorce? Jon, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Hey, Bob. Good! He was a goddamn monster. She had put up with her life for 7 years.

It's all over now. - We need to open the door. - What are you doing? No, stop! We need to kill him! - He'll really die! - Stop! I can feel the wind. We need to open the door! Oh, Delish! That was dumb of me. I just hate to lose. You're preparing for university, right? You sure don't give up easily. You set a goal and see it through. I like that. You remind me of my younger self. Hey, Bob. - Drive properly. - Sorry, boss. Where were we? Oh! Let's have a meal at my place sometime. That's all right. He must be busy studying. That's right, I'm a student with a part-time job. - I'll get off here. - No way! I'll let you off right in front of your place. Where do you live? I live right there, in Sunshine Village. Sunshine Village? I live there, too! Which house? - Number 21. - I live in Number 22! Whoa, Delish! We were next-door neighbors! What a coincidence. Wow... - I'll get going. - Wait. I want you to know this. Your entire life will change because you saved me. Why don't we exchange numbers? - What's your number? - It's 010... You should have let him die! Why did you have to go in? And why did you give him your address? What were you thinking? I was thinking it might be suspicious if he sees me in the neighborhood. Fine. What are we going to do now? Can we continue this after my exams? By then, I'll be back on Qualla Island. Do you want me to live like this forever? Bum-woo, my guy. A good quote for you. Virtue is something you win by overcoming obstacles. There are visible virtues and invisible virtues. Invisible virtues are unrecognized good deeds. Recognized good deeds are visible virtues. This is a shared post. I don't think I can do this. A person shouldn't kill someone. You twerp! You're the one who suggested killing him. Don't you want me to be happy? I'm sorry. No, you've done enough. Thanks, Bum-woo. I can do this by myself. I'll handle it, but can you get me some peanuts for the last time? Almost done... Where is he? I'll sprinkle the peanuts. He'll choke and fall. Sprinkle, choke, fall! Sorry, William. Here's my gum. Go now. Just throw it onto my roof. You can do this. Just do it, Yeo-rae. Someone must die. Where are the peanuts? - Hello. - You... Surprise! You don't have to be that surprised. I invited him in for a meal. Oh, William! Good dog, good dog! Oh, my. What is this? Oh, damn it! - Bob. - Yes, boss. Take William to his groomer. I'll go get changed. Make yourself at home. Mi casa su casa. Did you make bean stew? Mmm, smells good! Delicious bean stew! I told you to throw the peanuts onto my roof! - He forced me inside. - Give me the peanuts! I'll sprinkle the peanuts. He'll choke and fall. Sprinkle, choke, fall! This isn't the right day to do this. There is no right day. Just hurry. These are unpeeled! Peanut taste is undetectable if you add in basil. Grind them up! It's not powdery enough! - It's too conspicuous! - What? What are you doing? Stop it! You crazy idiot! Wow, Bum-woo! Do you like bean stew? Delish? Yeah, it's delish! Wow, bravo! It's good! Even our taste matches. Where are the Susans? I sent them to the department store for your clothes. Good. - Bean stew! - Enjoy. Let's dig in. Ouch, that's hot. Isn't it hot? Wow, incredible! It's good! Honey, give us some more. He's a greedy eater. - It's hot! - Again? I guess he loves bean stew. He's like a Mukbang YouTuber. Good? Oh! It's my turn. Give it here. I can't resist a competition. Just give it a taste... It's hot. - Good? - Oh, it's good! One more! I'm just getting started. - Good! - Good! It's good! - Good? - Good! One more bowl? Where's toilet? Can't you hold it in? Yes! What's this? It's my phone. Your phone's right there. You're right. Whose phone is that? The bean stew was salty. Do you want some water? Tell me the passcode. It's not mine. I could find out myself, but I want to hear it from you. Who have you been contacting on this phone? President Choi? Director Song? Where are the tangerines? Honey! What do you think you're doing? Honey, honey! Fang Yeo Rae! Open this door at once! Get over here! Oh, no... Yeo-rae... Cushion! Get the cushion, quick! Cushion! Throw it over here! - Turn him over. - Me? - Do it, now! - I can't do it! Hurry! Honey... EpiPen! Oh, no... What are you doing, Bum-woo? I thought Jon Na was hurting you, so I called the cops. You... Just go home! We ate bean stew... - we didn't put anything... - It's over. You can do it. It was you. You saved me. You love me so much that you want to kill me. I'm going to stay with you forever.

I'll come find you, no matter where you are! - Run! - Delish! Bum-woo! Neck chop! Hammer fist! Do you know what losers have in common? They keep making the same mistakes! Over and over again! That's why you can't get into university, you loser! Loser? Loser? Don't get out! Hard work... Who's that? Isn't he Bum-woo's friend? Never betrays us! Seoul U! Oh, he's the legendary, the fifth year! He's been studying for five years? Hard work never betrays us. Damn it. I guess he has a lot of pent up anger. Fifth year! Fifth year! The tangerine broadcast will begin in Studio No.3. Jon Na, screw you? Raise your arms properly. I said properly! Run your mouth again. Jon Na! I told you not to touch Bum-woo. Didn't I tell you to go to the airport? I decide where I go, you jerk! Young-chan! - Yeo-rae... - Come here! You little brats! It's Yeo-rae's fan club. I did my best.
