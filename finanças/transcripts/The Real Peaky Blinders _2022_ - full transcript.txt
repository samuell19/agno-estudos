12th of March 1921, Sandown Park Racecourse... ..and a man called Sydney Lewis is standing up, taking bets as a bookmaker. A hard man approaches him. He wants to have a bet for nothing. Sydney Lewis refuses the bet. The horse wins. Lewis refuses to pay him. Enraged, the gangster picks up his heavy field glasses and smashes them into the face of Sydney Lewis. As he falls on the floor, the gangster then stamps on his face and walks off. This savage assault marks the beginning of something Britain has never witnessed before. It's England's first major gangland war between two gangs from different cities. Throughout 1921, hundreds of gangsters fight brutal running battles for control over illegal racecourse rackets - thugs from Birmingham and South London on one side, Italian and Jewish mobs on the other. There was this absolute organised gang system in Britain. People had guns and people had knives. They were glamorous. They were awful. And at the root of these racecourse wars is a man called Billy Kimber... ..Britain's first nationwide gangland kingpin... ..and someone who came of age in Birmingham's Peaky Blinders street gangs. One of the most important people responsible for the beginnings of organised crime in Britain. This is the story of how Birmingham's Peaky Blinders gave rise to Britain's first organised crimewave and how a lowly street thug became Britain's answer to Al Capone. So, this is the Birmingham City Police mugshot book for the early 1900s. You can see some of the famous Peaky Blinder mug shots. These pictures were taken at the lockup. Here in the West Midlands Police Museum is Britain's biggest collection of Peaky Blinder photographs. Birmingham Police were the first in the country to take mug shots of criminals and built up this vast archive. I just feel like there's a sense that every single one of them has got a story to tell. They're just fascinating. Some of them really seem to look right into your soul. The Peaky Blinders were a collection of street gangs who terrorised the back streets of Birmingham in the 19th century. By the beginning of the 20th century, it seemed their time was over. Increased policing and new diversions, such as sports clubs and the cinema, had seen their numbers dwindle. But in fact, the story of the Peaky Blinders was only just beginning. Between 1914 and 1918, six million young British men are swept up into the First World War... ..many Peakies among them. We've got a baby-faced Henry Fowler on the far left. He fought in the Somme and was injured. We have Stephen McNickle, another Somme survivor, came home injured. It's quite interesting that a lot of these people spent many, many years breaking the law in their own country before deciding to go and fight for it in another. So, in this book, I'm going to show you the record of Henry Lightfoot, who was actually the first individual to be labelled as a Peaky Blinder in the press. So, he actually joins the army during the Great War, and he is a common criminal. He's got a long criminal record by that point, and he continues to offend in the army. He's disciplined on multiple occasions for insubordination in the army. He experiences the first day at the Somme. He's injured in battle. So, he does go through the mill and experiences first-hand the horrors of the war. And then he comes back to Birmingham, potentially with shellshock and other afflictions, PTSD, maybe - like many other soldiers, not very well diagnosed at the time. I do definitely believe that after the end of the First World War, all these young men came back seriously damaged by what they'd seen. In an hour, they'd see a thousand men blown to their component parts. You know, the bar has been raised to such a ridiculous level that violence suddenly becomes acceptable, and I think they were all very traumatised. And they'd done things that were horrific to them and they'd done it in the name of the authorities, so I think some people came back with an ambivalence towards authority. It's one of these ex-military Peaky Blinders in particular that historian Professor Carl Chinn has spent decades researching... ..a Peaky Blinder who will become the most powerful criminal in Britain. I've been researching this chap - he's called Billy Kimber. We know him from the drama series as a Londoner, but in reality, Billy Kimber was a big, burly Brummie from Summer Lane, a tough neighbourhood. He had been a Peaky Blinder. He'd been birched for an offence when he was 12. He got done for attacking people and assaulting the police. He was a petty criminal. He becomes a pickpocket. The First World War comes. Kimber joins up in 1915. But like a lot of gangsters, he deserts. And it took me ages to find out where he goes to. And look at this - he turns up in Dublin in 1917. This is the Dublin Daily Express, Friday, May 11, 1917 - "Englishmen charged in Dublin. Alleged pocket-picking". Kimber is one of the two men arrested with one of his pals from Birmingham. A telling point here is that Kimber and his pal get arrested at a railway station on the day of the Leopardstown races. What's interesting, then, is that a really top bookmaker on the racecourse and a credit bookmaker called Thomas Day sends his clerk - that's his most important member of staff - to Dublin, to act as surety for Kimber. That's intriguing. That tells me that Kimber and Day have got a relationship, and then I find it. I find the relationship in Day's book. Kimber is the minder for Thomas Day. On racecourses awash with pickpockets and thieves, bookmakers like Day need thugs like Kimber for protection. What can we deduce from this? Well, Kimber is active as a racecourse ruffian and rogue. To understand why Billy Kimber is hanging around racecourses with bookmakers when he should be fighting a war, we have to go back to the start of the century, to the beginnings of a career that will transform organised crime in Britain. By the early 1900s, racing has become a British obsession. The Epsom Derby just outside London attracts an estimated quarter of a million people. Hordes of punters walk from the city and thousands camp the night on the nearby downs. The Epsom Derby was a great kind of cross-class event whereby working-class punters might catch a glimpse of the aristocracy, of royalty. Most people were working a six-day week and very long days, cooped up all year, all week in their homes. A day at the races offers them a great kind of colourful, fun-filled day. It's about escapism in what is an otherwise relatively bleak existence compared to today. What makes a day at the races so exciting is gambling. So, gambling was pretty much ingrained in English life, everyday life. If you were the industrial working class or the rural poor, you'd like the idea of a bit of a flutter on the horse racing. For the upper classes in puritanical Edwardian Britain, gambling among the great unwashed is cause for concern. As the century wore on, moral disdain that many of the elite felt for poor people gambling gathered pace, and it culminates with the formation of the National Anti-Gambling League and then the Street Betting Act of 1906. The 1906 Street Betting Act makes all forms of gambling outside of racecourses illegal. It will prove a turning point in the story of crime in Britain. Just like prohibition of alcohol spurred the rise of organised crime and gangsterism in America, prohibition of gambling will have the same effect here. The Street Betting Act of 1906, it's a very explicitly class-based Act of Parliament. It actually says, in the letter of the law, "This is to prevent betting amongst the artisan classes "of Britain's towns and cities." This doesn't prevent a single bet from being laid. What happens is that illegal bookmakers set up throughout the residential districts and in many of the workplaces across Britain's towns and cities. Steven Knight is the writer of the Peaky Blinders drama series. He grew up with family stories of illegal gambling on the streets of Birmingham. My mum told us all the stories of her childhood, and she was a bookie's runner from the age of nine - because, obviously, off-track betting was illegal, and so they'd used children. And she would walk down Green Lane in Small Heath with a basket of washing, and people would walk in the other direction and they'd drop into the basket a piece of paper with their code name - cos, obviously, they couldn't use their real name - the coins that they were betting on, the name of the horse and the odds. They'd drop it in. And then she'd go down to the end of the road, turn into this little courtyard where there was a dog on a chain that was just short enough that the dog couldn't get you, and she'd walk past the dog and take it to this bookie. My mum said that everybody gambled. I think there was one person in the alley who didn't gamble, and that was seen as really quite odd. The real money to be made in gambling in the 1910s is at the races themselves. These are the only places where respectable punters can legally go to bet - and where large amounts of cash is changing hands gather the thieves and the rogues. Among them, ex-members of Birmingham's Peaky Blinders. Peaky Blinders in Birmingham may have been disappearing in the early 20th century, but gangs from Birmingham were becoming more prominent on the racecourses, travelling the country, making their money from pickpocketing and blackmailing bookmakers. But from about 1910, this loose collection of rogues is brought into a slightly more ordered gang called the Birmingham Gang. The man who does that, the overall leader, is Billy Kimber. Kimber, though, is not only a formidable fighter, he's got a brain. And he starts to realise there are more lucrative opportunities in the south of England, particularly in and around London. Billy Kimber is moving around the country, building up a network of both allies and enemies. Carl Chinn has tracked Kimber down to an incident in an East End pub in 1913. Here's the evidence, look - the Illustrated Police News. And Kimber is named under the headline "A Charge Of Stabbing" - "William Kimber, living in Westminster Bridge-road." He's arrested with a pal of his. They've knifed a man in the back of the neck, they've cut up the left side of his face and they've thrown chairs at him. It comes to court. The witnesses all say, "No, it wasn't Kimber and Sage!" They get off with it. And the victim was a racing man. And Kimber and Sage are described elsewhere as "well known on the racecourses". By 1914, Billy Kimber has become a name among petty criminals across Britain's racecourses. But that's nothing like what his empire will become after the First World War. War changes everything for both Billy Kimber and the story of crime in Britain. Kimber joins the army. Most horse racing is halted. By the end of the war, there are only 11 flat race meetings still running. But with peace comes a brief economic boom... ..and the so-called Roaring Twenties are just around the corner. The Roaring Twenties happened not as a consequence just of the end of the First World War - and this is very topical for now - it came as a consequence at the end of Spanish flu. And during Spanish flu, everybody was wearing masks and they couldn't get together and they couldn't go out and lots of people were dying - it was very terrible and tragic. And then when it went away, it was like the champagne cork flying out of the bottle, fireworks going off. Everybody went a bit mad. It's like all this pent-up emotion of people wanting to enjoy themselves. People want to get back to normal, they want to get back to pleasure, so one of the things they want to do is go to the races. All spectator sports boom, and horse racing is amongst them. There are huge crowds at horse races. And there's lots of people with lots of money. The soldiers and sailors who have got their gratuities - their payoffs from the army - they're spending cash freely. There seems to be this period between the end of the war and into the '20s where it's a little bit of a free-for-all on the racecourses. Into this unregulated, booming post-war racecourse scene returns Billy Kimber. He reunites his Birmingham Boys gang, and together they spread out among the racecourses of the Midlands and the North. But now Kimber's not interested in just pickpocketing and petty crime. He's got his eyes on the people who handle the real money - the bookmakers. On the next event. 5-4. Yes, sir. What do you want? Three Monkeys? HE DOES PATTER Simon Walmsley comes from a long line of bookmakers. He grew up with stories of how bookies were the beating heart of the racecourse experience. Back in the day, very, very busy, packed full of racegoers. All the bookmakers as well, they're all... So they'd all be in a line? All be in a line, sometimes two or three lines. Depends on the layout of the racecourse, layout of the betting ring, cos the only place you could have a bet was on the course. Carl Chinn's family started out as illegal, off-course bookmakers. You're the showman, in't ya? Yes. I've got to pull these people in. I've got to get him to bet with me. I don't want him to bet with him next door or him next door. I've got to get him in with me. So give me some of your patter. 5-4. Three bar one. Come on, gather round! You could be on each way! Winner each way! Each bookmaker has what's called a tic-tac man, who uses signals to communicate changes in odds to fellow bookies across the crowded, noisy enclosure. Number two is 7-1. Number three is 7-1. Number four is 3-1. Five is 50. You've got six at seven and the bottom horse is eight. So every....number has got a... A signal? Signal. I often see tic-tacs going two hands on the top of the head. That's 9-4. 9-4? 9-4. 5-2. Yeah. 11-4. All the cash gambled on the racecourse goes through the bookmakers, which makes them a prime target for petty thieves, many of them children. Hod dippers... Why were the little kids, the little pickpockets, called hod dippers? Well, that's your bookmaker's hod. That's where your readies go, usually made by saddle makers. So, every race, you're taking your bets, you're putting your money in there, bit of change given out. If somebody gives you a score, they want a ton of change, that's where you've got to go. You've got to watch out for the hod dippers. Billy Kimber and the Birmingham gang have their own petty thieves called whizz mobs. They'd have organised gangs of pickpockets known as whizz mobs, whizzers. Yeah, yeah. And they'd be coming around, and they'd see somebody who got a few bob and a nice win, and two or three would hustle him... Yeah. ..and the dipper would come in the back. Or sometimes they'd call him the tickler - cos he'd tickle the wallet out of you. And sometimes they were so blatant, they'd actually belt a bloke, throw him on the floor, two of them would hold him down, and the dipper would just take his wallet and probably his old turnip as well - the old fob watch! But Billy Kimber can see that the real profits don't lie in petty theft. They lie in extortion. Under Billy Kimber, the Birmingham Gang ramped up the blackmailing of bookmakers by extorting money for supposed services. The bookies have to start paying for the spot on which they stand their pitches. If they had to stand on a stool, they had to pay the Birmingham Gang to rent the stool. They have to pay for the chalk they use to write the names of the horses and the odds on their boards. They then have to pay for a bucket of water and a sponge to rub those odds and horses off for the next race. Then later on, they start bringing out what's called tissues. They're printed racing lists of the runners. The bookies have to pay for that. They're paying out a lot of money each race to the gang. Throughout 1919, Billy Kimber's Birmingham Gang takes control of the racecourses in the Midlands and the North. What we were seeing is protection of the bookmakers on a major scale. Money was sloshing around. By the end of 1920, Kimber stands at the head of perhaps the biggest, most powerful network of thugs and criminals ever assembled on British soil. But he wants more. The Birmingham Gang controls the racecourse rackets in the Midlands and the North with a rod of iron. And then in 1920, they expand south. Why? There's more money to be made. But if Kimber wants to move south, he'll have to confront the gangs of London. The day when most Londoners realised for the first time that their city had a gang problem had come in December 1881, when a shocking crime hits the newspapers involving a 19-year-old South London lad called Fred Wilmore. Fred came from Lambeth, just over the river, and he was walking here with a friend of his - also from Lambeth - and two young men came up to them and said, "Where are you from?" And they said, "We're Lambeth boys." Unfortunately for these two Lambeth lads, they have run into members of the City Road gang from central London. And what happens, according to the account of the court, is that there's a bit of a to and fro. "Are you the Lambeth lads? We're the City Road lads," And eventually, it turns into a conflict... ..and one of the City Road lads lashes out at Wilmore. He has a belt with a huge buckle on it and he uses it, and he basically hit him across the head twice with this buckle. Fred was beaten so badly, he fell to the ground bleeding. The City Road gang scattered. And then a few days later, he dies from his wounds. The coverage of Fred Wilmore's killing is the first time the press has picked up on Victorian London's growing gang culture. As in other British cities, London street gangs have formed in the late 19th century in the capital's most deprived areas. This 19th-century map was made by philanthropist Charles Booth to highlight the extent of poverty in London. Sarah Wise has been using it to chart the correlation between gang territories and deprived areas. So, the Old Nichol Slum here on the Booth map, just behind St Leonards Shoreditch, just north of Bethnal Green Road. And Booth has coloured it black and dark blue, as well as pale blue, indicating chronic poverty, which... He put at 80%, the population of the Old Nichol living in chronic poverty. And that was the highest percentage in the whole of East London. The conditions in which these people lived were really quite dreadful. No such thing as running water, necessarily. And it's not surprising that crime has always been one way out of the gutter. There's gangs in various parts of London, but there's a real concentration in the north and the east of the city. And so in the north, you have the Chapel Street gang, the City Road Lads. The Old Nichol was home to a gang called The Lads From The Village. They were at constant war with the Columbia Road Larkers. We had the Hackney Road Roughs and we have the Hoxton Market Gang up here. The gangs in London were street gangs. They were fighting gangs rather than anything else. They're territorial. They just like defending their bit of London. They haven't got any really good thoughts about how to earn money properly. It wasn't organised in any way. In the summer of 1898, a mass outbreak of gang disorder sees a new word enter the popular vocabulary - hooligan. What happens that summer is that, in London, there are a whole series of disturbances involving groups of young people in the working-class districts of the city. And in the midst of this kind of moment of panic about youthful disorder... ..the press pick up the name of a gang in South London who've called themselves the Hooligans. The Hooligans have taken their name from a cartoon strip about an Irish family in a comedic magazine. They're drawing on a very powerful Victorian, anti-Irish stereotype depicting Irish people as drunken, disorderly, prone to violence. And what's really interesting, then, is that a gang from South London, some of whom would have been themselves the descendants of the famine-era migrants, pick up that label "hooligan" and they actually turn around this anti-Irish stereotype into a badge of pride, and they make it the name for their gang. Press absolutely loved stories of hooliganism. It was a godsend to them, really titillating for their readers to open their pages and read about boys murdering each other and boys taking each other on and street battles throughout London. And so then any street fighting gangs that's reported in the late 19th and in the early 20th century gets described as hooliganism. When Billy Kimber begins expanding his racecourse operation southwards in 1920, he knows he will need local allies. He turns to one of the oldest of London's territorial gangs, the Elephant Boys. My uncle Wag, he led the Elephant and Castle Gang after the Boer War, up to the First World War, so that's my connection. When I was a teenager, my aunt Ada would tell me - cos I was a good listener - all the stories about the family. The Elephant Gang dates back many, many years, a large, sort of sprawling gang of originally pickpockets and footpads who used to haunt the Elephant and Castle Tavern. And, of course, it developed over the years into one of the major gangs in London. It had a reputation for violence, but also a reputation for organisation. Intriguingly, the Elephant Boys already have an alliance of their own with an all-female shoplifting gang known as the 40 Elephants. The 40 Elephants, most of them lived within a half-mile radius of the Elephant and Castle, and they were described in the newspapers as the cleverest thieves in the world, who could spirit things away underneath the eyes of shopkeepers. These women had shoplifting pockets and they had bloomers into which they could shove... Believe it or not, fur coats could go into them, and they would waddle out of the shop. They took jewellery, they took coats. They would go into hotels, and if a coat was hanging on the back of a chair... It had gone. The Elephant Boys' alliance with the 40 Elephants helps generate cash for both gangs, making the Boys one of the strongest, best organised outfits in London... ..which is why Kimber turns to them to be his London allies. This unique photograph shows Kimber, with members of his Birmingham gang, palled up with the Elephant Boys. This is a wonderful picture of the gangs. There's Billy Kimber, light-coloured suit. And the McDonald brothers are there. The Elephant Boys. Brummie Sage, who was a Kimber man. You've got another McDonald in the front row. People at the end are the bus driver and so on, but all the rest are what you could call players. The mob Billy Kimber has put together represents a watershed in the story of criminal gangs in Britain. These men are no longer slum kids fighting for pride on the street. These aren't boys. Perhaps many of them were involved in territorial gang fighting as young men, but they've now matured and they've moved on to racketeering and violent protection as well. The Birmingham Gang is a collection of really nasty, vile men, some with records of manslaughter and other violent crimes. The members are older men and, of course, they are much more driven by money making. They look very different from...kind of the youthful fighting gangs. With the Elephant Boys as allies, Kimber begins his push into the southern racecourses at the end of 1920. The local bookmakers don't know what's about to hit them. 12th of March 1921, Sandown Park Racecourse... ..and a man called Sydney Lewis is standing up, taking bets as a bookmaker. A hard man from the Birmingham Gang approaches him. He wants a bet on the nod. That means he wants to have a bet for nothing. If it wins, he wants his money. If it loses, he's not going to pay. "No bet," snapped Lewis instantly, recognising him for what he was. But after the race, the mobster came along for his money, insisting that Lewis had taken the bet. Sydney Lewis refuses to pay him. Enraged, the gangster picks up his heavy field glasses and smashes them into the face of Sydney Lewis. Down went Lewis, and the assailant promptly stepped on his unprotected face as he lay on the ground, immediately afterwards slipping away into the crowd. Lewis was picked up, his face a bloody mess and with several teeth missing. The Birmingham Gang will come to regret assaulting Sydney Lewis because, in fact, Sydney Lewis isn't his name at all. The man they've beaten's real name is Alfie Solomon... ..a Jewish bookmaker with connections in London's criminal underworld. So, Alfie Solomon was born in 1892, and he's born to a family of fruitiers in the Covent Garden area. And he fights in the First World War, but he also has some convictions - both before the war and after the war - for gambling. What's happening is that the Birmingham Gang is extorting protection money from all of the bookmakers, but they are anti-Semitic. They really hate the Jewish bookmakers, so they are squeezing even more money out of the Jewish bookmakers, who are overwhelmingly from the East End - from Whitechapel in particular. Solomon is part of a rapidly growing Jewish community in London. By 1919, an estimated quarter of a million Jews are living in Britain. The vast majority are law-abiding citizens, but there's also a small, though powerful Jewish gangland. And it's to a man described as the godfather of this underworld that Alfie Solomon turns to for help... ..Edward Emanuel. Edward Emanuel is born south of the river in Bermondsey. His parents originally come from the East End, and so they move when he's a child back into the East End. He works at Spitalfields Market, and so he can legitimately call himself a fruiterer and a green grocer, and he does pretty well at that, but he's obviously got other side lines going on. Edward gets involved in various illegal activities quite early on. He's got quite a record for fighting and for other violent forays throughout his early life. He had a reputation of being a fixer of things. He fixed boxing matches between Jewish fighters. But he was a clever man. Emanuel is known as the Godfather of the East End, in part because he runs a network of illegal gambling clubs known as spielers. What spielers were were illegal, small, kind of ad hoc, amateurish gambling houses. We had many of them all over not just East London, but also in central west London as well. Now, the reason they're called spielers is it's a German/Yiddish word meaning "to play", and it was somewhere you could go to make small bets or actually sometimes larger bets. And because of the very stringent gambling laws in England at the time, they're not legal, and so they were liable to be raided by the police. They had all sorts of lookouts and bouncers to keep out nosy people. And I found this story of one of Edward Emanuel spielers being raided, and this is the Evening Post, 1917, so the war is still raging. The police have had this particular spieler under surveillance for five weeks, and when they break in, there's a big commotion and they arrest 101 people. The press coverage of this raid typifies the anti-Semitism of the time. Interestingly - and not very pleasantly - the newspaper takes the time to point out "Only 28 were British subjects", which means that the bulk of these people were Jewish. The newspaper kind of says, "Why are you here, "sitting in a small Whitechapel gaming house, playing cards, "when you should pretty much be out in the trenches "fighting for king and country?" So, we're already seeing that real kind of anti-foreigner, anti-Semitic overtone. Anti-Semitism is absolutely rife in the late 19th and in the early 20th century. The Jewish are themselves stigmatised and really demonised as having links with organised crime in this period, whether it's because they're seen to populate the bookies' trade or whether it's because they're regarded - predominantly in the jewellery trade - to be working as fences of stolen goods. And then there's so much racial prejudice against them. By the time Alfie Solomon comes to him for help in 1921, Edward Emanuel is gaining a formidable reputation. He's even survived being shot in the chest in a criminal feud. East End gangster Arthur Harding would go on to describe Edward Emanuel as king of the East End gangsters... ..so that gives you some idea of just what a big man he was. Emanuel agrees to take the side of Solomon and the other southern bookmakers, but to confront the Birmingham gang, he knows he'll need some serious muscle. And for that, he turns to another of London's immigrant neighbourhoods, Little Italy, centred around Clerkenwell. Much has changed since the 1920s. But the Catholic Church of St Peter's - once the heart of Little Italy - still stands. There were around 24,000 Italians in Britain at the time, of whom half were living in London, and so this was the main Italian quarter. The Italians brought a huge range of new skills to London - they made woodwind instruments, they made optical instruments. They were very highly skilled artisans. One of the other specialities that they had, they worked in the ice cream trade, also known as the hokey pokey trade. It's the son of a hokey pokey vendor that Solomon and Emmanuel are interested in. A man called Darby Sabini. Darby Sabini was born in Little Italy in 1888, and sometimes he's known as Charles Sabini, and sometimes he's known as Darby Sabini. Darby is his nickname. I know about Darby Sabini as a consequence of research. He was the head of the Italian gang, and he dressed like a tramp, because he believed that if he dressed like a tramp, the police would never believe that he was, he was the leader, which he was. He was quite a powerful man, used a knuckle duster. Boxed as a welterweight. He's said to carry a revolver the whole of his life, and sleep with it under the pillow. And if you ever see pictures of him, compared with some of the others, he was by no means the smartest of them, but he was probably the toughest of them, which is what counted. It was always, it seemed, the most brutal would come to the top, and that was Darby Sabini. Darby Sabini and his gang are already in Edward Emanuel's orbit, as they provide muscle for his gambling dens. So when Emanuel comes looking for an army to take on Billy Kimber, a deal is soon done. The lines have now been drawn. On the one side stands Billy Kimber and the Birmingham gang with their London allies, the Elephant Boys. On the other, Alfie Solomon, Edward Emmanuel and the Sabini Gang. The story of British gang culture is about to enter a new, unprecedentedly violent chapter. The Birmingham gang gets wind very quickly that Darby Sabini's going to be coming in to support the Jewish bookmakers. They're not happy, and they're not going to stand for it. So they confront him at Greenford Trotting Track on March 21st. There's about 20 of them. One of them shouts out "I'll murder him." Another one shouts, "Let's get the so-and-so." Inspector Heaps, describing the affair, said, "There was a shot, and smoke arose above Sabini's head." GUNSHOT He had a revolver in his hand. The crowd was trying to rush him, and he pointed his revolver from left to right, saying, "I'll shoot." He then ran backwards, but a police sergeant came up behind him and threw his arms around him. They start belabouring him with pieces of wood, bottles and whatever else they can get their hands on. He's fearing for his life. One man was shouting, "I'll murder him." There was a struggle to get the revolver from Sabini, but it was eventually taken from him by a constable. Sabini's took to the station. They find a cut-throat razor in his pocket. Blank cartridges in the gun, but he should have got done. But guess what? He didn't. That fuels the suspicions that Edward Emanuel, the governor of the East End Jewish underworld, is paying off some of the police. This event, it's an escalation of the wars. It really brings Darby and the Sabini Gang into conflict with the Birmingham gang. Both sides know what war will mean. Bloodshed, imprisonment - possibly even deaths. So Darby Sabini decides to extend an olive branch, in a last-ditch effort to divide the racecourse spoils peacefully. Darby Sabini owned a flat in Collier Street. Word got to Billy Kimber that Darby Sabini wanted to talk peace, want to come to some sort of terms, and he invited him to the flat. Alfie Solomon's not invited. That tells us how much he was hated, and how much the Jewish bookmakers were hated by the anti-Semitic Birmingham gang. They're having a good meeting by all accounts. There's plenty of drinking and there's singing, and it may be that Kimber and Sabini are going to divide their rackets between them. Things seem to be fairly convivial. But then at midnight, who should walk in but Alf Solomon? As soon as Kimber saw Solomon, "What is he doing here?" you know, and made a move toward him. Kimber launches himself at him. He curses him, with horrible language about Solomon being Jewish. There's a struggle. Kimber's shot in the back. Kimber fell to his knees, he was bleeding badly. The taxi had been called, which turned up. The taxi driver took one look at it, and didn't like it, it drove off and came back with a constable. Which probably saved Kimber's life, because even though no major damage had been done, he was bleeding very heavily, apparently. Put into the car and taken to the Royal Free Hospital. Both Kimber and Solomon find themselves in court. In the dock, the two men follow the gangland code of silence, rather than grass each other up. Solomon claims the gun was Kimber's, and that it went off accidentally in the struggle. Kimber says he didn't see who shot him. Both men walk free, but any hope of a truce is shattered. Now it's certain there will be a war over control of Britain's racecourses. Throughout the spring of 1921, the two gangs skirmish across the southern racecourses. Several thugs on both sides are stabbed and beaten. Both sides are manoeuvring, awaiting the moment for a full-scale assault. After more violence on the racecourses, the Birmingham gang decides to put on a massive show of strength. Down south, at the prestigious Epsom meeting, it leads to what The Times calls the Epsom Road battle. On June 2nd, 1921, Britain witnesses perhaps the biggest gangland clash in its history. What happened was a group of the Birmingham boys who were coming away from the races set upon a group of Jewish bookmakers from Leeds. Now, one story is that the Leeds bookmakers were actually going to change their allegiance from Billy Kimber, and this is why they got set upon. The Birmingham boys wait until the bookmakers are leaving the course in their charabanc. When we got to Ewell, we were going up the little hill, when a taxi drove up across the road, causing our driver to pull up. Immediately, our car stopped. We were surrounded by a gang of men, anything from 50 to 100 strong. Each man carried a weapon consisting of hammers, iron bars, hatchets and lumps of concrete. They first broke the glass in the front of the car, then attacked us with the weapons described. The charabanc floor is covered with blood and broken glass, and hammers and other weapons are found there, including a revolver. Despite broken bones and savage lacerations, remarkably, no-one is killed. There are so few gangland murders, quite simply, because gangsters know if they get done for murder, they'll be hanged. So what they want to do is inflict as much pain, misery and scarring as possible. Initial reports from the scene suggest the violence is the result of rioting Irish nationalists. But quickly, the police realise it had been carried out by racing men, and they spotted a large group of them at a pub in Kingston. Over 100 police are rushed there, and then Sergeant Dawson confronts them in the beer garden. He's got a revolver, and he looks at them and says, "I'll shoot the first man that moves." The Birmingham gang pay a hefty price for their brutal show of strength. It's a costly mistake, though, this attack by the Birmingham gang, because 17 of the arrested men are sent down for long terms. They are amongst the most frightening and fearsome of the Birmingham gang, with convictions for manslaughter, unlawful wounding and violent robbery. The so-called Battle of Epsom propels the racecourse wars into the limelight. The press absolutely love the racecourse wars. It's got everything, right? It's got organised crime. It's got one of the most popular mass entertainments of the day, actually, going to the races, where there's a mixture of classes too, don't forget. So the threat is not only directed at working class punters, but there's middle and upper class people at the racecourses as well. The press is really important, in terms of the depiction of the gangs at the time, talking about them as terrorists or talking about them as being in some sort of war or conflict. The idea that people are fighting turf wars at the racecourses, and that you might witness that when you're there for a day out, it's really exciting. It's a great story, which is why they latch onto it. This is really the first tabloid engagement with organised crime. The racecourse wars now represent something unprecedented in the history of British criminality. It's England's first major gangland war between two gangs from different cities. And it's a war about to become even more savage. Obviously, the Birmingham gang is weakened by the imprisonment of so many violent men after the Epsom Road battle. But Billy Kimber decides another big show of force is needed in territory claimed by the Sabinis. The target Kimber chooses is the Bath Racecourse, a stronghold for the London bookmakers. It's August the 17th, and Alfie Solomon and his fellow bookies are preparing to work at the course... ..just as mobsters are pouring into the city. According to a local newspaper, hundreds of Birmingham toughs turn up at the railway station. They cause wild scenes, laying into all of their enemies, as they see them. Solomon is cornered alongside fellow bookie Charles Bill. Bill said he had just come out of a shop when a big man came up and seized him by the lapel of his coat... ..and hit him a violent blow on the head with a hammer. Then others struck him with sticks, and finally, another assailant pushed a sandbag into his face and hit him down. There were 100 to 150 of a mob around him. His attackers run off. He's covered in blood, he's almost senseless. But somehow he manages to struggle up to the Pump Rooms, where a maid tears apart a sheet and bandages his wounds. As for Alfie Solomon, he's been knocked unconscious by a hammer blow, and as he lies prone on the ground, he's kicked and hit. The two bookmakers are lucky to escape with their lives, and Kimber has won another victory. The Birmingham gang, it looks like they've got the upper hand. Massive shows of strength, at Epsom and Bath. But it won't be Kimber's brawn that will win the racecourse wars. It will be someone else's brains. And that someone else is the godfather of the East End, Edward Emanuel. He pulls together leading bookmakers from the south of England to form this organisation, look at it... The Bookmakers and Backers Racecourse Protection Association, this is a really rare booklet. And it's the speech he's made at the association's inaugural banquet in December 1921. What happens is, when this association is formed, it gets the support of the Jockey Club, the main racecourse authority. It gets the support of the southern police and then they employ Darby Sabini and some of his top men as stewards at a good wage of £6 a week. That legitimises the muscle of the Sabinis. There's the Sabinis, there's the police, the racecourse authorities. The Birmingham gang can't take them on. They have to give up, there's a truce. And it was agreed that Billy Kimber should have the tracks from the Midlands upwards, and the Sabinis and Edward Emanuel.. ..should hold on to the southern tracks. Each gang continues to extort in its own territory. But the racecourse wars between them are over. But their role in the story of organised crime in Britain is far from finished. Racecourses are now much better regulated, and they're much safer places for bookmakers and punters. And what do the Sabini gang do in those circumstances? They move into Soho. They start extorting money from nightclub owners, from publicans, from illegal gambling clubs. In August 1922, a group of men were shot at outside this pub, the Southampton Arms in Mornington Crescent. Listen to the headlines... "Racecourse feud affray." "Dramatic story of weapons used." "Walking stick curio." "Half revolver and half stiletto." Three taxi cabs drove up from Tottenham Court Road and discharged their cargo of 12 men. Some were armed with revolvers and other weapons. Joe Sabini was believed to be the principal of the gang and he was not the only member of the Sabini family in it. Witnesses said they heard one of the men saying, "We mean to fight "to a finish, we're going to be top dogs." The Sabinis are attacking members of the Elephant Boys gang, men previously allied to Billy Kimber. So, what's going on? Well, the truce with the Birmingham gang had a big problem, it left out Billy Kimber's London allies. They formed a new mob called the Camden Town gang. They've got no territory on the racecourses, they wanted it back. The racecourse wars have shifted from the turf of Epsom to the streets of London. The fighting goes on because Darby Sabini has moved into protection in Soho and there is still fighting by the Elephant and Castle boys who want to control Soho. Having learned the trade of organised racketeering from Billy Kimber, the gangs of London are now battling to control new rackets in the big smoke... ..something that's continued ever since. The Sabinis are very much part of the genealogy of gangland in London. And so the people that came after them definitely sort of nod back to the Sabinis. And in particular, people like Frankie Fraser, who then becomes in the late '50s and '60s, is a hard man for the Krays. But he actually starts his criminal career working for the remnants of the Sabini gang. And the Peaky Blinders? Well, they're the ones that started the whole process. They push the Sabini gang into becoming the model for all later organised crime gangs, like the Richardsons and the Krays. Yet despite being so pivotal in the story of British crime, names like Billy Kimber, Darby Sabini and Edward Emanuel have remained largely unknown until the recent Peaky Blinders drama. Could it be because in Britain, we've preferred stories of American gangsters to our own? In the 1920s, the British press becomes absolutely gripped with stories of gangsters in America, especially in Chicago, this is the era, of course, of Al Capone. You also get the release of films, the gangster films like Little Caesar, Public Enemy and Scarface, and those have a huge influence on the press and how they talk about organised crime and gangs. A character like Billy Kimber in America, he would be a known name. People would have heard of him because of his exploits. So what became of Britain's original gangsters? Alfie Solomon is convicted for manslaughter in 1924 after fatally knifing a rival thug. He serves three hard years in Kilburn jail and was last heard of in the 1930s, living in Gerrard Street, central London. Edward Emanuel eventually goes legit, and dies in 1943 age 63. Darby Sabini gives up his criminal career in 1926 and lives out his life in semi-retirement in Brighton and Hove. And as for Billy Kimber... perhaps the closest thing Britain ever had to an Al Capone... He's one of the most important people responsible for the beginnings of organised crime in Britain. According to Legend, he flees to America, where he works for associates of the actual Al Capone in Chicago. On his return to England in 1929, he reinvents himself in Torquay as a legitimate bookmaker and dies a wealthy man in 1945. As they say, the bookmaker always wins.
