[MUSIC PLAYING] We ought to find a place to stop for the night. Sure. There's a nice place there. Alright, boys, you better get out and help make camp. There, now, let me help you. Put 'em up and give me you gold. Who do you think you are? I'm Billy the Kid. Yeah, I'm the sheriff. Ouch. Let go. Let go! Mom! Tell me what's wrong. Johnny's hurting my wrist. You boys stop that. I'm sorry, Billy, I didn't know that thing hurt. That don't hurt. That's a birthmark, silly. You twisted my wrist. [GUNSHOTS] Get down, boys. There they are. [GUNSHOTS] What's the matter? Won't that work? There. [GUNSHOTS] Mom, mom, look at Billy! Billy! Billy. Billy. Hey, Johnny, help me load that thing. [MOTHER]: Billy. [GUNSHOTS] Put away your guns and offer to surrender. That wouldn't do any good. He's never showed me or mine any mercy. What do you mean? Why he's the cruelest bandit in the southwest. He hates me like he hates no one else. Do... Do you mean? Yes, Martha, it's the cat and his gang. [GUNSHOTS] Alright, boys, they're about done for. Let's close in. Get on your horse. [CHEERING] [INAUDBILE] Johnny Hume attempting to ride Dynamite. The one and only outlaw of the range that has never before been bested by man. [CHEERING] From Cheyenne to Fort Worth, he is the meanest, buckingest critter that ever had a man sat across his back. [CHEERING] And now, ladies and gentlemen, Johnny Hume know will give you a sample of real Texas sportsmanship. [CHEERING] [GUNSHOTS] Uhhh, wait! [CHEERING] [GUNSHOTS] Johnny makes the rest of us look like a buncha screwbars. He the reliantest, sh... shootinest, son of a gu... gu... gu... gu... He's nothing but a show cowboy. He wouldn't be worth his [INAUDIBLE] And his trigger finger gets buck fever when the guns shoot back. Let me tell you something. I can't wait that long. Tonight [INAUDIBLE] to all winning contestants at the Red Fort Saloon. It give me great pleasure to award this silver lined, two ply, hand tailored, bridlin' bit to the champion of chamions, Johnny Hume. Much obliged. Now, fellas, this concludes the awards for this evening so let's give our esteemed fellow citizen a big hand. [CHEERING] Alright, fellas, the drinks are on me. Say, you fellas are in on this too. Thanks, we've all sworn off. Well, I wasn't tryin' to tempt you. Just wanted you to know you were welcome. Well what will you have, Johnny? I thinkin' I'll stick to sarsaparilla. I reckon you can't stomach a man's drink. I haven't found out yet what a man's drink is. I'll have scotch and soda. Me t... t... too. Only no so... so... so... He wants his scotch without soda. Thanks. What do you say, fellas? Let's drink to the champion tails us from the southwest. Let's have at it. I thought you were going to say champion for pleasure. Such as wearing notches on the handle of the gun, when you never even killed a snake. That ain't ethical in these parts. That gun belonged to my father. [LAUGHTER] That's all the more reason you got no business carrying it. Why, if there was anybody more gun shy than you. I mean when guns are needed. It was... Hey, wait a minute, you can talk to my pal like that. Stick 'em up, everybody. Keep, your hands high. No monkey business. Get the horses, Tex. The first one who reaches for his gun goes down. No one's going to get hurt, men, all we want is the cash drawer. Turn your faces to the bar and keep you hands in the air. Drag out your cash drawer, bartender, and shove it across there. And be careful, no monkey business. Come on, hurry up with that drawer. It won't pull out. Well, hand out the cash, then. [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] Alright, fellas, get the bartender to the doctor. [GUNSHOTS] It's alright now, they're gone. Nobody's going to hurt mama's little champion now. Do you mean to say you were there all the time and didn't shoot. Sure! He's death on bottles, but when it comes to real gun play he's yellow. Aren't you forgetting your prizes, champion? Wh... Where you headin' for? I don't know. Just going, that's all. W... well just going won't get you nowhere. It'll get me somewhere else. After what happened tonight I... I can't face anybody here again. Aw sh... sh... shucks, you don't want to take it like that. They're right, Oscar, I'm just gun shy when guns are needed. I've been thinking maybe I'd get over it. But I never will. Just when I began to get the nerve to do something the picture of what happened to me on that terrible night when I was a kid pops up before me. I guess some people are just born yellow. Now Johnny, listen... It's no use. Goodbye, Oscar. You've been a darn fine pal and I'll never forget you. Mr. Johnny, listen. Hey, Johnny, wait. [INAUDIBLE] Thanks. You don't me to tell me that you came all the way out here just to get a match. We... we... we... we... well I'm did ju... ju... ju... about out of to... to... tobacco, too. Thanks. I'll p... p... pay it back when we get to the next town. I didn't ask anybody to come along with me. Well I gotta have so... so... so... somebody to ab... ab... ab... ab... a bartender no to put soda in my sc... sc... sc... sc-sc... sc... sc... sc... sc... sc... Scotch. [GUNSHOTS] Hey, Pat, get that stagecoach and take it to the hideout. We want the gold. [GUNSHOTS] Are you hurt badly? Not so much. Just a little tuckered out. [INAUDIBLE] Wh... wh... wh... should I d... d... do? Help me get the driver [INAUDIBLE] inside. He's been shot up some. Can I help some? Ye... ye... ye... yeah, you mind helpin' me get him in the co... co... coach. Come on. Are you comfortable? Do you want a handkerchief? This will stop the bleeding until we get to town. You are wonderful. If you hadn't come along when you did, we'd all be killed. It wa... wa... wasn't me la... lady. It was m... my pal out there on the dr... dr... dr... driver's seat. Le... le... let's go, Johnny. I think you'd better do the driving, Oscar. Oh, sure. Could you hand me that blanket please? Is there anything I can do? I don't think there's anything we can do until we reach a doctor. Meanwhile, you've done enough already, Mr., uh. They call me Johnny Hume, Miss, uh. My name's Ethel Cochran. Well I'm mighty pleased to meet you. They must have outnumbered you six to one. I've never seen anything so courageous. Yes, I. When we get back to Lawless they'll probably want to make you Marshall Marshall? Let's get going, Oscar. [WHISTLE] Ge... ge... ge... get! What happened? Attempted hold'em up. The driver's been shot up some. If you'll take care of him right away he'll be alright. Ethel, you alright? Yes, I'm alright, father. Thanks to Mr. Hume. If it hadn't been for him I don't know what would have happened. Thanks a lot Mr. Hume. I didn't do anything, I... Here's the express box, Mr. Carson. I'll go home, Ethel, as soon as I can take care of this stuff. Hopefully we'll be seeing a lot of you Mr. Hume. He's the fightingest cuss I ever seen. Every time his bean shooter pops, someone drops. He can [INAUDIBLE] Oscar, take care of our horses. Alright. Well goodnight, Mr. Hume, and thanks. Well, may I help you with your bags? Where are we going, Mr.Hume? I'm gonna take you home. Well I think we better turn back, we passed my house a half hour ago. Well, gee, that's funny. Well, I reckon I better let you do the steering from now on. You know, you're a funny person. What do you mean? Well, you route up a gang of outlaws almost singlehanded and then you attempt to deny it. Well that's because my pal Oscar did most of the shooting. Oscar said you did it. I wish one of you would make up your mind. Good. The way to a man's heart. This kind of cooking would have a man's heart hogtied and branded at first taste. Yep. If I was staking out in these parts, I'd be proposing permanent partnership with the cook. Just where are you heading for? Well, I don't know. I haven't made up my mind yet. Just a maverick, I guess. I imagine Lawless would make you right welcome. Anyone that can use a gun as handy as you can... Do you use sugar in your coffee? Yes. Drink are on me. Scotch and soda for everybody. N... n... no s... so... so... so... so... Well then, take some soda. Give him some soda, bartender. Bu... bu... bu... but I don't know wa... wa... wa... want any. Say, you always stutter? N... No, only when I talk. Joe, I'd like to see you out here a minute. No leave you drink there. That's right. I reckon you've had enough, Joe.. I know when I've had enough. It ain't that. I promised the Wells Fargo man I'd keep you sober if he let you keep your job. Now, go home, Joe. Well, here's to, uh... what'd you say your friend's name was? Johnny Hume, the fightinest [INAUDIBLE] in Arizona. Did you fellas ever hear of Billy th... th... the Kid? Sure, he was the toughest gunslayer that ever drawed. That's what you think. The reason that Billy the Kid moved to Arizona was because he heard that Johnny Hume was moving to Texas. Is that on the level? Say, he must be a terror with a sixshooter. That ain't all. Black [INAUDIBLE] surrendered the minute that Johnny set foot in California. Well, goodbye Miss Carson. Meeting you has been very pleasant. Will I see you again? Maybe some day. But right now I'm thinking about pulling out. Goodbye. Goodbye. Hello. Hello. Must you be going so soon? Yep, my partner and I are thinking on pulling out. Well that's funny, your partner just said you were liable to stay in Lawless, Lawless would be right glad to keep you. I appreciate them feeling that way about me. I guess my partner got our plans mixed up. We're heading up into Utah. Well I'm sorry to hear that. Anyway I want to thank you for saving my daughter's life. And the express box. I didn't do anything much, just cleaned up the job after the marshall had almost finished it. Where'd you get that gun? It belonged to my father. Your father? You say your name was Hume? Yes. I hope you like it over in Utah. It's a good place for you to be going. Dad, why did you act that way? Did you see those notches on his gun? Why yes. One of them was put there because his father killed my brother. You mean murdered him? Well, that's what it amounted to. He took advantage of the fact that he was a law officer. But it was murder just the same. I know Bob was a reckless kid when he was drinking, liable to shoot up the place some. But he wasn't hittin' anybody. He [INAUDIBLE] him just the same. And with the greatest pleasure [INAUDIBLE] my p... pal and fellow citizens, Johnny Hume accept the great honor that you have p... p... p... p... paid him. And furthermore, the same as he ri... ri... ri... ride Jesse James out of K... K... Kansas, He'll r... run every outlaw out of A... A... A... Arizona. And th... th... third... Congratulations m... m... Marshall. Come on boys, let's get three chants for the new Marshall of [INAUDIBLE] [CHEERING] Now wait a minute, there must be some mistake. There's no mistake at all. In this room you see most of the citizen in the city of Lawless. By unanimous vote, they have decided to ask the United States government to make you the new Marshall of Lawless. [CHEERING] This belonged to Dave, but it'll give you the authority you need until the government can issue a new one. Wait a minute, I'm not qualified to be Marshall. That's a good one. A man good enough to scare Billy the Kid and not qualified to be Marshall of Lawless How about that? How bout the time you got all the rustlers out of Oklahoma. Listen, please. That stuttering horn toad that calls himself myself pal is the biggest liar in six states. If he ever told the truth, just once, his tongue would start tying up. Was the stage driver lying too when he said you come down this afternoon shootin' like nobody's business? Hey, wait a minute. Suppose you fellas give me a chance to think this over. I'll let you know the first thing in the morning. See you in the morning. Hey what is all this talk about Billy the Kid and the rustlers of Oklahoma? I ha... haven't the l... l... least notion. Well I have. You lied 'em into trying to make me marshall. And knowing all the time I have no business with any shooting job. J... j... Johnny, you're alright n... now. Maybe I am. Likely as not the next time I do just as I did in Redfront. I b... b... bet you wouldn't. Well maybe. But I can't trust myself. We've got to saddle up and get out of here. Wh... When? Right now. Oh but J... Johnny, I'm all tuckered out. I need some s... s... s... s... s... s... s... Sleep. Thanks. Alright, we'll rest for a couple hours, but we've got to get out of here before morning. It was the cat who killed my family. What are you going to do? Well, gentleman, if you still want me, Lawless has a new Marshall. [CHEERING] Line up at the bar, boy. The drinks are on the house in honor of our new Marshall. [CHEERING] I reckon the cant and his gang from now will have their hand full. Yeah. Who is this Cat? What does he look like? Nobody knows. Nobody's ever seen him. As soon as we think one cat is done for, there's another to take his place. All we know he's a cruel. Ruthless killer. I only hope that someday we'll meet. He's the darndest Marshall I ever knew. Going out and taking these bad men with his bare hands. He claims there's only room enough on his dad's gun for one more notch, and he's saving that for someone special. I call it darn foolishness. Ever since I can remember, the shootinest guntoaters in the government service have tried to beat the cat. And they're all under the ground today. Make it two blues. But no Cat has put this boy there yet. This time if I was making a bet, it would be on the Marshall. Well maybe so, maybe not. He's come out all right so far. But I'm not sure the Cat has started to claw in earnest. I guess I can afford to look at another card. Did you tell the boss? Sure. So the new marshall is saving room on his gun for a notch for somebody special. That's what they claim down at Lawless, Capt. Maybe they mean you. Well that suits me fine. Only he's putting too many of you babies in his nursery. A fine bunch of gunslingers you are. Why don't you trade that in for a peashooter? Maybe it wouldn't be so dangerous to play with. Well I'm doing the best I can. That's not good enough. I want him out of the way. And I'm not particular who does it. I figure on pluggin him pronto, only I can't do it right out in the open. If I do something to get the spyglass on me, how am I gonna find out about the next shipment of ore? Yeah, that's right. Sure, ain't that why me and Dick are heading into town tomorrow to feed old Carson some booze? He's right, boss. We can't keep them thinking we're a couple of gingerbreads till we start throwing lead at the Marshall. But maybe after we get old Carson drunk enough to spill us what we want, We'll see a chance to do some shooting. And when we do, why... Well, boys, I guess I've had enough. Oh come on, be sociable. Tex and I don't get to town very often for having blowouts. And you're good company. Bottoms up. Easy with that stuff. Well, it's good. That's good. I wish your father wasn't so unfriendly. Is he? You know he is. He's all but forbidden me to see you again. Oh, he'll get over that. But it would help if you gave up your job as Marshall. Look out, the little dickens scratches. What's the matter with me being Marshall? Well father figures you're just a hired gunman in pay of the government. Somebody's got to keep law and order. Yes, I suppose so. But I wish it weren't you. I hate to see you become a killer. Shooting men just because the law says it's alright. Does it make so much difference to you what I do? Yes. I'll give it up, just as soon as I finish one little job. Must you wait to finish it? I'd lose my self-respect if I didn't. And you wouldn't as me to do that, would you? No. I knew you wouldn't. And I don't mean to do any killing I don't have to, either. [MEOW] We're almost forgetting our little family. Shoot, little dickens. I think he likes you best. I always could get along well with cats. You know, they say dumb animal's the best judge of human nature. I don't know about that. When you're through, I mean with that job you spoke of, are you going back to Utah then? I've been figuring on putting it to a vote. Oh, you won't have to do that. If you're leaving it up to Lawless, they'll want you to stay. Oh I don't mean they. There's only one vote I care about. Would it be yes or no? Carson, I don't think you know what you're talking about. Nobody taking any gold out of these diggings anymore. Don't know what I'm talking about, eh? I know where there's lots of gold, make your eyes pop out. Where? Express office. Bringing it in tomorrow from [INAUDIBLE] mine. You boys gotta keep that to yourself. Nobody's supposed to know it but me. How bout the marshall? I ain't tellin him, neither. Me and him aren't on speaking terms. Come on, drink up. I thought you and the marshall were on good terms, Carson? I reckoned so, too. I hear he's been cavorting around with your daughter. My daughter, eh? I'll show him. I'll run him out of town. You got a gun? I don't need a gun when I've got these. Anyway, you better take this along for protection. You give me that gun, Carson, you're liable to hurt yourself. Leave me alone, I'm alright. I'm going skull-cracking. Wait a minute, Carson. Leave him alone, he can't hurt nobody. Well, maybe you're right. Oh, there you are. I'll show you how to get sweet on my daughter. You're letting a little whiskey do a lot of talking, Mr. Carson. Give me that gun. Mr. Carson's gonna murder the marshall, I'm gonna help him out. You're gonn get what your father gave my brother. Now just keep calm and everything... Shoot the gun out of his hand, marshall. Hey if the find out who done the shootin, we ain't got a chance to get out of here. What the doctor's want. Go get the doctor. I was aiming at his gun, I couldn't have... [INAUDIBLE] You got him right in the heart. The marshall just shot your dad, miss. My dad?! Yes. Down in front of the saloon. Gotta get some water for him. Father. Alright, take him off to the doctor's office. If you'll listen I can explain. I was standing here. Now here's the saloon window. And Carson was there. Now can't you see a bullet fired from this window would come along this line. But I ducked low to get a better bead on Carson's gun. And that must have been just as the other fella fired. So the bullet missed me and hit Carson. What makes you s... say that? There doesn't seem to be any reason why someone would want to kill Carson. But there's plenty why they'd want to plug me. Well, m... m... maybe you're right. I'd gamble on it. I've got to find out who was in that saloon. I don't want people going around thinking I did it. Come on, [INAUDIBLE], get going. [GUNSHOTS] [INAUDIBLE] [GUNSHOTS] The robbed the express office. Alright, men, get your horses. [GUNSHOTS] I'll sneak of this way, and the rest of you lead them on a wild goose chase. Come on, boys. [GUNSHOTS] You fellas follow the shooting. I'm going up this trail. B... b... b... Get going! [GUNSHOTS] Drop that stuff on the table. Put that in the safe. Sure. You don't need to tell me that's one of the bandits. Looks like it, doesn't it. Ever see him before? Yes. Frequent. Him and his partner was around here, a couple or three days ago. Could that be the day Mr. Carson was killed? Yeah, fact of the matter is him and his partner and Carson were drinking in the back room. What does his partner look like? I can't say exactly, they all look alike to me. What are you driving at, marshall? We had nothing to do with killing Carson. We just pumped him some about that gold there. We left before he was shot. Funny you'd start denying something before you were accused. Let's talk a walk over to jail. T... t... t... take him, to the jail. Well, did you get them all? W... w... well I think I m... m... missed a couple of them. But we didn't find no g... go... gold one them. Well, don't worry, I tended to that. So there was nothing for me to do but get off my horse and sneak through the brush. Funny Tex isn't showing up with that gold. Took the shortcut up through the ravine. Should have been here an hour ago. You didn't see this new marshall, no place? Nope. It was kind of dark. But I'm pretty sure. He's likely taking care of Tex, then. You don't suppose... I don't suppose anything., only you're all a bunch of fools. Letting one marshall outsmart you. I suppose if I want this thing done, I've got to do it myself. What are you figuring on, Cat? I'm going to send this new marshall an invitation to pay me a personal visit, and all you've got to do is deliver it. He either killed Carson or knows who did it. But I haven't been able to make him talk yet. Now if we could get a line on who the cat really is, we'd get some place. Right. Like this or not, he could be walking around right under our noses. Mmhmm. D... d... do you really think so? See that fellow at the door? Keep an eye on him, see where he goes. You wouldn't mind my giving you a little advice, would you? I'll listen to anybody if it will help me get to the bottom of things. You'll never get to the bottom unless you take better care of your health. What are you talking about? I never felt better in my life. I'm talking about the chances you take with these outlaws. You come out whole so far. But you haven't met the Cat, himself, yet. That's just what worries me, not getting a chance to. All I'm waiting for is for him to come out into the open. That isn't the way the Cat does it. If you want to beat him you've got to draw cards in his kind of a game. He never rattles before he strikes. So that's the way you keep your eye on him is it? Come on, wake up, we go work to do. Come on, start stuttering. Go outside and keep your eye open for him. He should be getting here by now. And as soon as you spot him, come back and let me know. Just drawn up the canyon, chief. Are you sure he was alone? Alright, hide your horse and wait outside the house. And when you get a chance, plug him. Billy, you the Cat? [GUNSHOTS] The doctor said I must keep you quiet. I'm sorry I wouldn't listen when you wanted to explain, dear, but everything's arlight. Before he died, the Cat told who really killed my father. The Cat, dead? Yes, dear. You can turn in your marshall's badge now, you got the Cat. Yeah, I got the Cat. [MUSIC PLAYING]
