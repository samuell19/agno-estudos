Buy a motorbike with your earnings.. .. and ride it in front of these fellows. They won't value you until then. ..or become a Police Officer like him. There's a problem with slow-speed ride.

I'm tired-out of these two, Leela.. This is regarding a tree-felling case. No troubles, right? Hey, not at all. Will the Inspector beat-up?

Sir, I'm the complainant. Don't rush-in. Stay back. You proceed. These two are my sons.. trouble-makers.. Every day, they make quarrels.. Last two days, they're fighting for a tree-felling issue. Sir, please make an end to this. Sir, I'll make it clear. Our home is at a hill-top. There was a tree in our land. I had got its sapling from the school. Liar!! He has no primary education. Sir, I used to drop him at school. Yeah, only to drop me. Okay sir, let it be. I used to urinate.. ..by leaning on this tree each night, after coming back from my work. The day before, I had a long-trip work. After coming home, I leaned to pee and I fell down. See, my jaw is injured. I escaped only because of loose soil there. Otherwise, I'd have died. -This scoundrel sold it off. -He was so stoned. Come here. He was heavily drunken, when he leaned to pee. What did you do with that money? Sir, I didn't sell the tree. -I know how to.. -Sir.. Shut-up!! Promise! I didn't do. I know how to make you tell the truth. -Sonu. -Sir. Tell him the next letter to sing. Sir, it's 'Pa' Yeah.

Sir, case will be registered? Not certain about it. Don't change your word at the eleventh hour. I do have limitations. You try by hook or crook. Vasudevan Sir isn't here. That brought me here. He doesn't want his direct involvement. Vasudevan could call.. He can't involve directly.. You must act efficiently. How could I? I'll have a word with that man. Try that way. -Sir.. -Yeah? He won't be beaten-up, no? No. I'll take care of that. It's Vasudevan.. Sir, Stephen from lumber-mill. Stephen. It's Inspector here. Who received the cash from you? -Alphonse? -My God, me?? No? Then Marcos? Pappukutty? Alright, then. Fine now? You began all this. He's Vasudevan's brother. Shall we let them go? Hariharan, it's a narcotic crime. We can't let it go. Should we think once more? No. I'm damn sure. You leave it. [Chatter] Mom.. tell him.. Sir, thanks for all. Let's take your leave then. They settled the issues. You can't leave like that. He gifted me gold-chain last day.. ..spare him for the last time. Case has changed. Tree was Teak, no? -Yes. -At whose property? -Mine. -So, primary culprit. He, the second culprit. You both can leave. Forest officers will deal this. Sir, I'll sing once more. -Sir, dad is an ace singer. -I heard enough today. We will try on another day. Let the forest officers come.. -Hello. Who's this? -Which is the next letter? -What? Who are you? -The next letter to sing? -What? Next letter? -Sir... Dad will sing by the letter 'Pa'. Will you spare him? So..

You don't be scared, Ma'am.. You might have seen in 'Youth Wing' hoardings. I'm the.. Folks call me 'Malaysia', out of affection. -This sir only.. -Vasudevan, why did you come? See.. he addresses me by name. This Dasettan is the only person after my.. ..parents who calls me Vasudevan with pure care. You know one thing, Ma'am? I was rushing by leaps and bounds from Coimbatore. I had no other choice. After-all he is my own brother. Sir, never picks our calls too. Today, sir arrested my brother in a cannabis-dealing case. It's no big-deal. The real issue is... The opposition will show-case this case.. I haven't harm you by any means till now. Till now!! Hey. Give the sweets to the kid. Got from our own bake-house. It's really good. What's the real motive for this gang-visit? You better don't know about me. I never travel alone. My wife uses to tell.. ..that I even go to brothel with a gang. Okay. I'll take your leave. Hope you understood. I'll visit often then. Good Night. Hey. Stop playing with the cellphone. You're making it run out of charge. I'll stop. Dry-out clothes from the washing-machine. Okay. You want to say anything? -The admission process has started. -Umm.. We must pay term-fee in advance. Can I get the money got from our sold-bike? Yeah, but he is planning to buy a car. [Sighs] How can he buy a car with the money from selling my dad's bike? You can also use it for going college, no? I've lost my last-hope. He wants to go Coimbatore for studies.. Admission process is about to begin at Music College there. Let him finish his current course first. Later, we can think about this. But he is absolutely interested in music. Interested in music?? Real crap!! How much did we pay for engineering course? Four-hundred.. Four-hundred thousand.. -For this course? -Three-hundred. -What? -Three-hundred thousand. Three-hundred thousand. Should I say anything more? -No. -Okay. Did the Inspector come? He went to court for a case. So, you literally locked-out the station today? -No sir. Other officers are there. -Sure? -Inspector might have reached by now. -Okay. -This is your new probation Sub Inspector. -Srinivas. This guy is a distant uncle of mine by traditional relation. So the same caste.. Nowadays, persons don't prefer surnames.. ..so it's hard to know the caste. Mr. Das is the Inspector of Kedaram Station. He neither has a surname or caste name. He is a good officer to begin with. Apart from music-craze, he is fine. Not mere music sir, but Antakshari. Whatever the hell it be, tell him to limit himself. Now the entire department knows it.. Then, why can't we transfer Das from here? I'm not even capable to do my own transfer. -What's your problem with Das now? -Nothing, but.. ..the pleasure I get from saluting you, never get there. It's your personal problem. In that way the whole hierarchy.. ..of the Police department has to be changed. That's not possible. You'd better resign from service then. He possesses a different politics. He'll use it against us at nick of the moment. Oh, now you flipped your side? Take your leave.. -All the best. Have a rock!! -Thank You -Sir, are you married? -Yes. Yes, have a daughter too. Will they shift to here? Nope. The climate is tremendous here. Yeah, but daughter got admission in a school there. There are good schools here. Our children study here. [Chuckles] Yes.. How many children do you have? -Only one daughter. -Yeah.. Appeared for entrance exams and anticipating for results. Pull-over Reverse the vehicle. Enough. Where are you heading to? -Where? -Kedaram. Exact address? Won't you speak? I think, she is dumb. Sir, there aren't any public.. ..transport at this hour. Sir, shall we drop her? Okay. Get-in. [Gestures] Get-in. We are cops. -She is not blind, Sreekumar. -[Chuckles] Close the door. Shall we move? Your name? -You expect a dumb to speak? -Oops.. Her name is Nayana. Nice.. Sir, are bus services limited to Kedaram? Yeah, comparatively rare. Superintendent didn't mention anything about this place? -Not really. -Umm.. You must have gathered minimum information about your joining station. Mere job-training is not adequate. Experience plays the real role in your job. Sir.. This is a land of hills, valleys, plantations.. ..and some families too. Comparatively we have lesser work-load. How many years have Das sir completed here? Almost two years, right sir? Don't address him as 'Sir'. Sir.. My foot. Get me a piece of glove. Okay. Ready. -What? -[Gestures to make it wear] Okay. Make it slow.. Careful. [Both Sighs] -You asked him? -Yes. I did. You can go anywhere after the current course. -I want to join by any cost. -Don't be adamant dear.. How I can be peaceful, after you leave? Are you peaceful now? Please be silent. [Sighs] I added some money with the bike-sold amount and got a new car. You can use car to go college, not the institutional vehicle. Keep the key. It's you who brought this asshole!! Sir. -Local government body, called for? -There is a protest at tomorrow morning. -Just informed it. -Which party? Vasudevan's party. -When will they reach? -They have reached nearby. Okay. I'm leaving then. Intimate Hariharan to call me. Our new joinee, Probation S.I is also accompanying them. I'll wait then. Let them come. -I think, he is the cousin of Superintendent. -Yes sir. -Be watchful with him. -Sure sir. -Sir!! -[Chuckles] -Sonu.. Order me a cup of tea. -Okay sir. -Bye. -Bye. See you then. Come.. ♫ I'll sing a song.. ♫ ♫ I'll sing a song, and play the lyre.. ♫ ♫ Twitch your tail li'l myna, did you know.. ♫ ♫ That impudent little damselfly That twitters from her bamboo crate.. ♫ ♫ I'm going to marry you..♫ ♫ and I'll take you away. ♫ ♫ I'll take you away. ♫ Letter: 'Pa' Let you sing dear.

[Stammers to speak] [Stammers to speak] I'm.. I.. Chitra..Stay calm.. Tell me.. -[Break tears] -Don't be upset dear. [Weeping] [Weeping] We came straight here, as soon as we were informed. Sir. Srinivas. Sub-Inspector on probation. Follow him. You could have showed your vengeance straight to me. Why did you choose my daughter? Daughter? What happened? Don't wash your hands. Did you use these fellows for this? See, I'm a straight-forward person. Whoever you are, I don't care. Don't ever dare to repeat this. Got it? Dasetta, don't be tensed.. I'll act face-to-face.. ..that's why I didn't transfer you from here. Take your leave, sir. Don't be scared my dear. I'm saying you, no? [Sighs 'Yes'] Are you sure, it's him? I'm damn sure. It's him, Vasudevan. I had a word with him. He promised that, he won't repeat it. Unwantedly, don't be tensed. [Cellphone rings] -Hello. Sir. -Das.. Is she fine now? Doing better now, but she really shook in her shoes. It'll take time to recover from that shock. -You suspect anyone? -Sir.. It's.. Then, why did you go to Vasudevan's house? I firmly suspect his involvement.. What? Just because of a food-cover? I'm answerable for your irresponsible actions. Last night, he came here to threaten me. Why didn't you tell this earlier? Now, everybody will think this as your cooked-up story. Sir.. what should I do now? Conduct a proper investigation. It's a kind of abandon place no? Somebody might have did for fun. Sir, you feel this as a funny act? Then, conduct a proper investigation rather than.. ..raising unwantedly against reputed persons. Okay sir. I could empathize with your circumstance.. But look before you leap to leave no stones unturned. Okay. Hey.. Ice-candy. -Money? -Wait. Ice-candy? Let's move.. ♫ Pick those daffodils The twilight sky cradles ♫ [Humming] No one has the right to touch my cat. I'm Karthik. Your name? Eyes? [Chuckles] Nice name, it is.. ♫ ♫ -Sir.. -Yes. -Sreekumar. The same girl. -Yeah. She is. We're police officers came for the passport verification of this girl. She doesn't belong to this place, no? She was in Delhi with her mother. She came here a few days before. -So, she did her studies there? -Yes. Does she have a conduct-certificate? She doesn't have one.. Sreekumar, mention it in the remarks. -Give her address in Delhi. -Okay. Present residents here? We both stay here. We'll wait for the report from college. Will that take long? No, we'll let you know. One min, I'll be back. Sreekumar, I feel that they are rich.. -Keep that in mind, when you deal. -Okay,sir. Sir, that cellphone has switched-on. It has registered in the name of a Bihar-native, Ramesh Yadav. Also, tracked the current-location. It's a poultry farm, around 4 Miles from here. ..work-place of migrant-laborer. Should I go and check? No. I'll go. Sreekumar, did you track that phone-number? Cyber-security force intimated, they'll contact once it get switched-on. -Fine. -Okay sir. Srinivas.. Sir, call to that contact.. Yeah. Dad.. Letter: 'Na', right? 'Na'.. Let me think Dad.. [Thinking] 'Na'.. Got it.. Bingo!! ♫ Oh beloved, I lay wait in anticipation.. ♫ ♫ Of your approaching footsteps ♫ ♫ Laying out its wings in your path.. ♫ ♫ The fluttering birds are my eyes. ♫ ♫ Oh beloved, I lay wait in anticipation.. ♫ ♫ Of your approaching footsteps ♫ ♫ Laying out its wings in your path.. ♫ ♫ The fluttering birds are my eyes. ♫ Sir.. Sir. Nothing significant. So, this phone doesn't belong to anyone of you, right? This isn't my cellphone, sir. Then, how did this come here? I got this from road. This place belong to? He is a Tamilian. Whom? His name? Rajan. Rajan. -Collect the details of this Rajan.. -Okay sir. Also collect these fellows' identity cards. Sir, should we arrest and interrogate them? No need. It's not them. -Daughter? -Slept, already. Karthik? He went for a movie with friends. -Which movie? -I don't know that. Which movie-house?? You don't even know that too. Do one thing.. You both can get inside, only after he comes. -Why are you sitting outside? -Just waiting for you. -Had dinner? -Yes Maa. You? Yes. [Sighs] -That man, slept? -Yes. -Can I ask you one thing? -What's it? Why can't you divorce this man? I haven't come out from the personal-defamation of.. ..my first divorce yet. Then, how could I think about this? Let's not do it.. We have all freedom to leave this home.. ..but, what about Vidhu? Come. Time for bed. [Sighs] I have already inquired about local-criminals here. There isn't anyone who sings left in our jurisdiction.. May be a child-abuser, no? If he is, he could have already left after attacking her. Who else then? Whoever he is, I'm sure, he is closer to us. I still think, somebody is doing it out of fun. I mean, then why he needs to play this hide & seek. Sir, can we interrogate Vasudevan once more? We had already interrogated him. As per your intimation, this isn't a usual case. Can we take a list of child-abuse cases of Kerala in recent years? Sir, new joinees have a habit of collecting these kind of lists. Then, who did all this? Huh? -Sir. -Be seated. Thank you sir. It's the mark of 10mm stethoscope. Check this width in the records of strangled homicides. Then, check the similarity of modus operandi. Sir, I must go to Superintendent's office, for collecting these data. A friend of mine works in Cyber Police wing, I'll try that way. [Frightens] [Sighs] Chitra.. Nimmi hasn't come yet? She is here. -Your name? -Ami Fatima. -You study in? -Class of two. How did this happen? -My uncle walloped me down. -Oh..goodness!! -It's done. -Okay. -Don't skip your medicines. -Umm.. What happened to her? She is so naughty.. ..she played with my brother last day and fell-down. Who entered in my cabin? Doctor.. ..to take the out-patient register. Why did you open my drawer for that? From now.. ..nobody is permitted inside the cabin on my absence. -Got it? -Yes. Idiot!! There are some cases which have close similarity with ours. But all those are closed ones. That means, all culprits are behind the bars. Two cases have identified with the reference of 10mm stethoscope. ..but both are registered in different categories. Tell me in detail.. First one.. March 11, 2010. ..at Kumarakom, Kottayam. ..victim: Kavita Rajesh. Age: 21.. Died by strangling with soft material, while taking bath. Okay. Next. Next one.. ..September 23, 1991.. -at Kollam. -Okay. Annie Mathew, Age: 16.. Registered as an accidental death. Died by strangling with soft material, while playing around. ..only mentioned as a soft-material. I found a possibility that, it could be a stethoscope. Send their contact numbers. You wait there. I'll get back to you, after calling them. -Okay? -Okay sir. Get the details.. Yes, it is. -Sir. -Here? Just to collect the details of some regional case files. Why? For my personal studies.. [Chuckles] Don't you have enough troubles at your station? Then, why an extra burden? -Busy? -I.. -Are you busy? -Yes... No.. I'm free [Both chuckles] Then, come with me. Come man.. Keep it ready. -Hello.. -Is this Rajesh's house? -Yes, it is. -Can you pass him the call? Rajesh.. I'm from Department of Police. Inspector Das. I want to know some details on Kavita's death. He died around ten years before. Oh.. sorry. He died one month after her demise. By the way, you called for? Just a normal inquiry. Was there any threatening calls before Kavita's death? No. Not-at-all sir. Alright then. I'll call you, if there are any other requirements. Okay sir. KAVITA RAJESH ANNIE MATHEW -Hello. From Department of Police -Tell me sir. -Is this Annie Mathews' house? -Yes. I want to know some details on Annie Mathew's death. It's null and void to enquire about an incident.. ..happened before two decades. Who are you, actually? Mother of Annie. Can I have a word with Mr. Mathew? Mathew died one month after her demise. That case's inquiry was a wild-goose chase. How did Mathew die? His corpse found on road.. Not sure whether it's an accident or homicide. Okay. Thank you. Will enquire and call you back. Okay sir. -Hello. -I'm the same officer. -Sir? -How did Rajesh die? He fell in a lake at night, when was returning to home. His head hit on a rock. He had heavily-drunken. Once before this, he had fallen in the same way. He turned to an alcoholic after Kavita's death. -Okay, -Umm.. Why they post family issues in our WhatsApp group? -Yeah. -Pointless. Yeah. Why are we discussing this now? That too pointless. You're right!! Are you attending Lachu's marriage? -Will you? -Yes. I'll. -We can go together. -Okay. On the way, we can pick your family too. -Good idea. -Yeah. [Getting irritated] Come to my cabin, after your work. We must reply to that family issue.. ..in the family WhatsApp group itself. Yeah, of course. -Hello Sir. -Srinivas, we have got a clue. -What's it sir? -Nothing, but a suspicion. In the both the cases, father and daughter had died with in a month. Anyway, you collect their details.. Also.. collect the data of similar cases were father and daughter died in a row. Okay sir. Hold it firmly. Hold it and play properly. Yeah, like that. You're doing good. That's it. Easy. -Hmmm.. -Play once more. Hold it. Hey.. Done with your studies? Go and study. Ignore it. Let's play. Strim it.. You're getting better now. Hold it firmly. Just like that. Go on. Very-good!! Oh my God!! [Sighs in rage] -What happened? -Mom.. That man.. my guitar.. Sir, there are two more such cases were.. ..father and daughter died in a row. One: 2016. Divakaran; daughter Deepika. Kochi Two: Rajan.. Daughter: Janki Rajan. Trichur. I don't think, these cases are inter-connected. Police department has also treated these as different cases. May be because of time-gap between deaths. I want to add on.. As per autopsy, both Divakaran and Rajan.. ..had died because of injury on right side of the skull. All deaths happened during different years.. ..places and age-groups. Not even a single connection point? How our case is connected with this? This 2016, Divakaran and Deepika.. I have seen this address before.. It's in Kochi. You had also worked there, no? I called in the number mentioned in that.. ..but is out of service now. We must enquire in this address.. Sir, you don't need to come. I can handle this. Sir.. This 1999 case in Trichur.. ..of Janki Rajan.. Jayachandran sir was the investigating officer. He was serving as Inspector. -Our Superintendent? -Yes sir. ♫ ♫ ♫ When the Gulmohar once flowered And blossomed a sweet bunch ♫ ♫ The northern breeze rented a room inside.. ♫ ♫ The northern breeze long ago. ♫ What's your motive for framing this as a murder-case? I think, he is behind my daughter's.. Who told you that? Srinivas? We suspect from our investigation.. Did I order you to investigate? -Your work experience? -Around 12 years. Yours? An officer with 12 years experience, believed this fellow.. ..and got into this investigation, no? You lack of basic common-sense? But sir, there are more such cases.. Dig-out all those cases; then I'll answer you. I'll deal your case with your parents. I must be paid for my consideration for you. Stay outside. Clear this off. Well then, I didn't believe any of the rumors about you.. Don't act smart with your political-spirit. -What did you mean? -Don't show your tricks.. -Sir. -[Gestures to stop] You may leave now. Hey.. Who named you Das? He might have thought, you'll become famous singer like YesuDas. Leave now. -Sorry sir. -It's alright. You smoke? -Nope. You? -Me too. Sir, I wish to go home for a day, regarding my daughter's admission. Okay then, but enquire in that Kochi address when you return. Okay sir. Brother.. [Knocks] Did you see my cat? [Gasping] What happened dear? -There.. -What's there? [Screams] Stop!! Stop!! [Panting heavily] STOP!!!! I say, STOP!! [Screams] [Screams] [Struggles] [Screams] [Struggles] [Screams] [Screams] If you have any plans to change her school in future.. Pay more attention to fill the admission form. Excuse me. An urgent call. Hello.. Sir. There's a problem. Where are you? The visuals of police officer attacks a lady is spreading in social media. As per current information, it's Inspector Das of Kedaram Station. Police department remains to be silent, ..even in this critical situation. [Cellphone rings] Sir.. What the hell did you do? You're sensational in media now.. Sir, let me explain. She was.. Enough with justifications.. How can you arrest her without a lady-constable? In that circumstance, I hadn't any other choice. I had told you several times, not to thrust nose into unwanted matters. Director General has demanded for report. What can I do now? I didn't file any case yet. I don't want your excuses. I need detailed report in an hour. Okay sir. 'Inspector Das is suspended from service.' In the incident of attacking the lady in public, ..department suspended Inspector Das for further enquiry. Kerala Women's Commission has also registered case... ..on the ground of visuals spreading in media. Director General draws serious attention to the negligence of police.. ..in the light of exceedingly increasing attacks against women. Tomorrow, I'll record her statement.. I've been waiting for this opportunity since he joined as my senior.. I have found a clause to defame them both.. Shit!! Don't be the old Adam to play these cheesy tricks. Any defamation is temporary. -I'll talk to her Grandpa. -Okay. Make sure that you get a statement against Das from her. He must be fired from job and let him play Antakshari at home. I'll take care of other matters. Bye then. -Early for lunch? -Yeah. -Same old-curry, no? -Not good. -Sir, you want curry? -No. -I have enough. You can take. -I said, I don't want it.

[Checking quickly] Statement of Nayana (20 Years), D/o Late Vinay.. ..resides at Marriyil House under Kedaram Police Station jurisdiction. Sir.. The complainant Nayana Vinay resides with my grandfather. Me and Inspector Das of Kedaram Station were in a relationship.. We use to meet often at the abandon home near by residence and.. ..do sexual intercourse inside that. For erotic pleasure, we use to torture and kill animals regularly,. On 20.03.2019, ..we had a personal quarrel and.. ..during a deadly act, ..as part of self-defense, I ran-off and.. ..and both attacked each-other in a public place. This has been recorded as my statement. I have verified it myself. Nayana Vinay. Signature. Sign right here. You can decide the statement. Proceed. Come on.. Sign my dear. No. I won't. Asshole. Did you think to fuck the Police by acting dumb? Sign here, you.. What happened sir? Who called you here? Stay back. It's directed to take statement on my presence. -Whom? -Srinivas sir. I'm the decision-maker here. That's not possible sir. I strictly demand my presence here. [Cellphone rings] -Tell me Srinivas. -Sir.. I forgot to mention in that mess. I had gone to Divakaran's house. House members were not there. When I enquired.. ..came to know that, his wife and son live in Kedaram. I had texted you their address. -Okay, -Alright then. [Text message receives] -Hello sir -Srinivas. The link between me, murderer and these murders is.. ..my motorbike. This contains cases which hadn't even recorded in Crime Records Bureau. You are right! Thirty-five years. Eleven murders. All homicides took-place in.. ..families used the 1984 model 'Bullet' motorbike with register number KLA 347. Sir.. First homicide took place in 1984. -Yes. -Next one in 1991, then.. What could be the reason for this much of time-gap? Some families won't sell the motorbike immediately after owner's death. Without transferring ownership.. ..relatives or friends may use it. There might had faced such murder-attempts too. In accident cases.. Families may leave it as it is.. So, that explains the gap between murders.. Who's his real-target? Srinivas, he doesn’t target on a person or the vehicle-owner.. He targets this motorbike.. He's been following this motorbike for last 35 years. Why nothing had happened in the family from which we bought this bike? There was.. deaths.. Persons mentioned in this list.. Divakaran and Deepika. It's Karthik's father and sister. When Karthik was born, his parents Latha and Divakaran.. They were separated. As they didn't legally divorce, ..after his demise the entire assets were transferred to Karthik. ..this motorbike too. I even thought, Karthik is Unni's son. ..so the public too. Killer might have the same belief. That might have canceled the chance of Karthik getting attacked. We need to find two things.. What's the motive? Who is the killer? How can we find that? To find that, we need to know.. ..the story behind this bike's primary owner, Ananthan. ♫ ♫ [Old Malayalam song] Aren't you ashamed to sit here after getting stabbed by a kiddie? You can just blabber. He's absolutely lunatic. You'll listen music like this, even when he kills me. Then.. Let's nip his madness in the bud today. Get-up. Come here.. Maa.. [Struggles] My son.. Leave him.. [Struggles] [Screams] [Cries out of pain] Stay still. Leave me... Shut-up!! Leave me.. Maa.. Maa.. Leave my mom.. you.. Open your fucking mouth! Leave me.. [Cries out of pain] [Cries out of pain] Block her mouth. [Lamenting] [Screams out of hurt] [Screams out of hurt] [Screams out of hurt] [Crying] Maa.. [Screams out of hurt] [Choking] [Choking] [Choking] It's same motorbike.. So he is the same guy.. As you think, he didn't kill Ananthan and Raghavan.. [Panting heavily] [Indistinct chatter] [Indistinct chatter] -Is this the lunatic boy? -Yes. Ananthan was studying for medicine. ..and Raghavan was as kind-hearted fellow. [Screams in rage] Stop there. Don't go there. [Screams in rage] [Screams in rage] Move that lunatic.. Move away you.. Take him away.. Leave me. Leave me.. [Screaming] Leave me.. Leave me.. A truck had booked for their hit and run. He caused some troubles on their funeral and.. ..countrymen got him to police station. He was extremely violent out of mental trauma. We shifted him to a mental asylum. You'll get further information from that asylum. -Remember his name? -Yes. Kishore.. Kishore.. Psychopathic patients behave in diverse manner.. As you said, he connects all the persons.. .. who bought this motorbike with the murderers of his mother. As he suffers from this mental-illness for last 35 years. ..so it has turned into his psychological nature. But, doctor what's the ground of.. ..singing and frightening us.. This indicates his abundant confidence in his acts or crimes. When we observe last homicides, crime had taken-place.. ..in-related to victim's hobbies or connected to such places. ..example: game of cards, liquor-bar.. ..like that Antakshari for you. Before killing the bike-owners, he primarily kills their children.. ..and he attains an ecstasy by seeing their agony and trauma. He finds his high from it. Doctor.. I'm.. I'm totally blank. Don't think, this is under our control. He follows only the pattern of victim's hobby in his crimes. ..and he has an unpredictable temperament. He is deadly-dangerous than you think. Pay more attention on your daughter. He'll surely come for you. Dad.. lets leave.. How can we find him? He will come for us. Sir, should I stay here during night for security? ..or me and Sonu, will stay in alternative days. How long can you stay for security? A week or a month.. ..or a year? Let him come as per his own plan.. If he gets to know that we are being alert.. ..he may wait for ages for an optimum opportunity. -I'll do something sir.. -No. My loneliness fuels his courage. That will trigger him to chase me and my daughter. Let him come for us.. -You're on duty, right? -Yes -Take your leave. -Okay sir. Don't be reluctant to call me for any needs. -Good Night. -Good Night. -Sleepy? -Yes. Can we sell-off this motorbike? It's not fair to trap someone in danger by knowing the truth. I said in thought of him letting us free from this chaos. Even if we sell this, ..he may not leave us free. What are you thinking about? [Sighs] I.. I don't think.. ..I can find him, Chitra. Everything will be fine. Unwantedly.. ..don't be tensed. It's been a long time since we slept peacefully.. Come.. Lets sleep well. Let you go bed. I'll join you. [Sighs] Silent!!

My father didn't name me Das after the famous singer YesuDas.. Dad was really fond of a book. 'Das' is the first word of its title. Thank you sir. Bye. See you. Which is that book? Sir. He has changed, I think.. ..but I can't confidently call it as betterment. Let you see him. Kishore.. Kishore.. Can you recognize this person? Das has come to meet you. I think, you still have anger on me. I.. I ain't have any enrage on you. By considering your condition and age.. ..you may get reduction in judicial-punishment. Even after getting free from prison.. ..please don't harm me and my family. I have come to request you this. Kishore.. Why are you being silent? Shall I believe that, you won't....? Das.. Which is the next letter to sing?
