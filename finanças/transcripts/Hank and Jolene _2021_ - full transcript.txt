(dot chimes) (singer vocalizing) (bright music) (pencil scribbling) (water gurgling) (Boy whirring) - Morning, Boy. (Boy creaking) (birds chirping) (bright music) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) - Oh, here he is. - Good morning, Hank. - Good morning, Aki. Nobu. - Morning. Hey, look at this. Bug bites me a lot, you know? - I keep telling Nobu that hiring you was the best decision we've ever made. And after all this time, we are still right (chuckles). - Don't think we had choice since he was here everyday strolling through the gardens. - It's peaceful here. That, and I like workin' with you two. - You ever get tired of the same old breakfast every morning? - Hm mm. - But nothing gets a day going better than bacon and eggs. - Leave him, Nobu. He can make his own choices. And why would he wanna get high cholesterol like you? - Oh, don't start nagging me. - Sorry if I just wanna keep ya alive. (Nobu laughs) - I'm fit as a fiddle, Aki, right, Hank? - Ha! If you mean a garage sale fiddle that no one's interested in, then I agree. (Nobu laughs) - All right. Good. I'll see you out there. - Okay. (Aki chuckles) - [Aki] Wear a hat! (birds chirping) (engine sputtering) - I brought you a new piece, Aki. - A new friend? - I thought you could use another one. - Let's have a look. Oh, this one has a curious face. I wonder what he's thinking. - Oh, she (chuckles). - Of course, I see that now. Maybe we'll call this one Emmy (chuckles). Oh, Hank, it's the best one yet. There are so many of them, and I can't tell them apart. But I know each one is unique, and belongs, just like you. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (spring boings) (gentle music) (wheels rattling) - Oh. I get real dizzy. Just needed for sit down for a moment. - You forgot your water. - Ah, thank you. Ah. (Nobu sighs) You used to count the log rings instead of splitting them, remember? I used to do that, too. When I was younger, my father always got upset when my pile was small. What were the oldest one you counted? - 212. - 212? Wow. 180 (chuckles). Each ring is a birthday for the tree, adding up. That's a lifetime of reverse determination. When you put your finger on each ring, what do you think the tree might have seen? - Lots. - Who knows? Maybe feuding brothers who make peace, a mother burying her newborn baby under the shade, or lifetime lovers sharing first a kiss at the trunk. How many summer mornings have greeted this tree? Not to mention, how many creatures called this tree home? And timeline of life, how fragile it can be. It's on my fingertip. When I count those rings, I wonder. - Me too. - All right, bring another over. - Shouldn't I start splitting them? - You will have plenty time of that before. - Before what? - Before it gets too busy (chuckles). Besides, it's good for the soul. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (ants scurrying) (wind whistling) (gentle music) (fence rattling) (chains rattling) (bright music) (pots rattling) (pots scraping) (dramatic music) (pot groans) (gentle music) (birds chirping) Have a good weekend, Hank. - [Hank] Thank you, Nobu. - Are you going collecting this weekend? - As usual. - If you find any mother of pearl buttons out there, pick me up one. (soft music) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) - Mwah. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (toy train engine rumbling) (toy train engine tooting) (crickets chirping) (cat meows) (ducks quacking) (boat horn blaring) (bright music) (can clattering) (Hank chuckles) (dryer rumbling) (clothes clanging) (broom rustling) (dryer beeps) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (soft music) - [Hank] #1? (water trickling) (music continues) (seagulls squawking) (waves splashing) Aloha, #1. (music continues) (birds chirping) (wheels rattling) - Delivery day, my favorite. We got those special order plants. We've been waiting forever. - Finally. - Yeah, I got a backlog of customers to call to let them know they are here. You'll deal with the requests. You start counting and bring them in. I will take this off your hands, and start making phone calls. - Sure. I'm on it. - All right. (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) (bug's leg squeaking) - [Aki] Nobu Hitahiashi, how many times do I have to remind you? Wear a hat in the sun. - I put sunscreen on. - That's not enough (laughs). (Nobu laughs) Do you want another heatstroke? - Ah, it was this one time. - Ah, that's what everyone says right before, "Ah!" - Hey, will you stop making the face if I put hat on? - Your big brim hat, not a baseball cap. (Nobu speaking in Japanese) - I'm serious. - And I'm Nobu (laughs). - Very funny. (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) - Paid day off, paid day off. - [Aki] Ha! - Paid day off. (soft music) (sonar beeping) - Hello. You've had a long trip. Bet you're thirsty. It's okay. (upbeat music) It's not big or fancy, but it's home. I like to collect leaves. Another hobby of mine. That's where I sleep. That's where I shower. Uh, sorry, I wasn't expecting company. We'll make this your home for now. It belonged to a friend, but he won't mind. I'm Hank. And you need a name. Let's see, hm. How about, Jolene? Jolene. (Hank chuckles) (water rushing) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (squirrel munching) Something mossy? Definitely leaves. How 'bout some tree bark? I could get used to this. (music continues) (whimsical music) (soft music) (wind whistling) (birds chirping) I dreamed that I was a rose that grew inside of a boy, close by a path none ever chose. And there I lingered day by day. Beneath the sunshine and the shower, I grew and waited there apart. Gathering perfume hour by hour, the story within my heart, yet never knew. Which is why I waited there and grew. I dreamed that you were a bee that one day gayly flew along. You came across a hedge to me, and sang a soft lovebird song. You brushed my petals with a kiss. I woke to gladness with a start, and yield it up to you, bliss. A treasured fragrance of my heart. And then I knew that I had waited there. We knew. How well did others feel, I wonder? (gentle music) (wind whistling) (birds chirping) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Nobu speaking in Japanese) (Aki speaking in Japanese) - Oh, Hankyung. - [Aki] Hankyung, we gave you an extra day off. Go and enjoy it. - Or feel free to move some cactuses out back. - [Aki] Stop it. - Sorry I didn't bring you anything today, Aki. - That's okay. But really, you should go catch a movie today. Or even better, go on a lunch date. - What's this? You meet someone? Look at his face. - (laughs) I knew there was something. - I wanted you to meet her. - I knew one day a cute young woman would come along. - Does she cook and clean? - Uh- - You gotta get one of those girls. - Why is that always a criteria for you men? - Don't ask me, it's just the law's nature. - (sighs) Would you believe I put up with this for 35 years? (Nobu chuckles) So, what's her name? - Jolene. - Jolene? That's an old fashioned name, Jolene. I bet she will cook and clean for you. Sorry. - I'd love to sit and have coffee with her. - I don't think she drinks coffee. - Tea? Who doesn't like tea? - Um, maybe not Jolene. - Is she the one? - (chuckles) I think I'm in love with her. - I knew one day you'd find love! Aw! - Careful, there's Jolene. She's right here. - Eh, that's a- (Aki speaking in Japanese) - That's Jolene? We're very pleased to meet you, Jolene, aren't we, dear? - Couldn't be happier for you, Hank. - [Hank] I could still move those cactuses for you if you're not 100%. (Aki speaking in Japanese) - I might have a little dizzy spell the other day. - And you didn't wanna tell me? - It was nothing. (Aki speaking in Japanese) (Hank groans) (Nobu laughs) (machinery whirring) - This place makes me feel small. Like you. Aki and Nobu, they're great. They're special to me, like family. Love and support unconditional. (Hank chuckles) (dryer rumbling) (clothes clanging) - Is that your favorite machine? Yeah? I have my favorite one, too. XJ900. - Sounds futuristic. - Thanks. What do you call that one? Guess you call it Out of Order for now, huh? Well, this is XJ900. He's the best. - Okay. - I'm Sam by the way. Well, Samantha, but I go by Sam, much to my parents' disapproval. One syllable names, they're so much easier to say and remember, so I'm Sam. - Hank. - There you go, one syllable name. I already have it memorized. (cart rattling) - You dropped this. - Thanks. Can't have a missing sock (chuckles). (dryer rumbling) (clothes clanging) Do you ever wonder where all the missing socks go? - Sometimes. - Right? Maybe there's a race of sock puppets that live beyond the dryers in a parallel universe trying to liberate other socks from the clutches of static zing. I'm really glad you picked this up for me. I don't know what I would have done if I had lost it. - It's okay. - Do you know how much this sock means to me? Do you know who this sock belongs to? Bill Murray. - Who? - Bill Murray. You know, actor, been in everything. Seriously? - Maybe if I see his face. - Really? Everyone knows Bill Murray. Okay, I wasn't expecting that. It was accidentally left here, and I heard it's his favorite. And since you saved it, I'll let you hold onto it for me. - But what if he comes lookin' for it? - I'll tell him you have it. Famous people have a way of getting what they want. (Sam chuckles) (Boy whirring) - Hey, Boy. I want to introduce you to someone. This is Jolene. (Boy creaks) Not Jolie, Jolene. Hold on. Jolene, this is Boy. (Boy stops) (Boy creaks) Yes? Yes, she is. (Boy rumbling) (Boy creaks) What was that? (Boy creaks) Inappropriate, Boy. Nobody thinks that. (Boy creaking) Well, I don't agree. (Boy creaking) Okay, okay, now that was just offensive. Maybe this wasn't a good idea. (Boy creaking) Real classy, Boy. (Boy creaking) Whatever. (bright music) (birds chirping) (gate rattles) Aki, I couldn't find you at the counter, and the gate was locked. - When Nobu and I started this nursery, we were gonna call it Sunflower Farms. I love sunflowers and I really like that name. But Nobu had his heart set on Muddy Boots (chuckles). This nursery for me has always represented the feeling a sunflower brings to the world. Bright, full of warmth, and I can't help but to wonder what this place would have been like had it been named that. (chuckles) But it's too late to change it now. I got mad at Nobu this morning for leaving the gate unlocked, really mad. I should've known better but I couldn't help myself. But it wasn't about the gate. - Where is he? - At home. - Is he okay? - He's bedridden at the moment. - What happened? - An angry customer came in when I was getting on Nobu. The man was a real you know what. Calling Nobu all sorts of nasty names. The guy kept on raising his voice, and Nobu had this look on his face. I've seen that look before, and I got really scared. Nobu was shaken up. I think he was still mad at himself about the unlocked gate. This morning left him stressed out and doubting himself. I worry it may be something bigger, like the early onset of Alzheimer's. I've realized that I can't do it all, worry about him, and keep this going. - What are you saying? - After I brought Nobu home, he and I had a long discussion, something we've had to think about before. - What? - We are closing the nursery. - I can fill in for Nobu. - (chuckles) I wish it was that simple, Hankyung. Besides, we already rely on you too much. And now I have to tend to Nobu, and it's too much to be at both places. When we first opened this nursery back in 1985, we agreed to run it side by side, 50/50, a partnership. But if my partner isn't here... - So, it's... What will happen to all the plants? The garden? - Everything will go, wholesale. - And then? - A commercial real estate company will probably buy the land. - And the shop, the counter? - Not exactly sure. - I love this place, you know? (Aki sobs) - (sniffling) Me too. - Working here is like, it's like... - Being with a family, I know. - I love with working with you and Nobu. - We know how much this place means to you, and we are so thankful. Nobu and I made this painful decision with your wellbeing in mind. So, your paychecks will keep coming. In fact, he is the one that suggested it. Can you imagine Nobu happily giving money (laughs)? - It's gonna be hard not coming to this place every day, you know? - I understand. Have one last walk around. Feel free to take home any plants. (solemn music) - Oh, what a day, what a day, Jolene. A gift from Aki and Nobu. A parting gift. It's gonna be really hard not going there everyday. Working there was more than a job. Guess you're my only family now, right Jolene? (cat ticking) Jolene? (Hank sobbing) No (sobbing). (solemn music) (birds chirping) (leaves rustling) (waves splashing) (seagulls squawking) (gentle music) (water droplets pinging) - [#1] Aloha, Hank. - #1? I thought Aloha meant goodbye? Wait, am I dead? - [#1] It also means hello. - Hello and goodbye? That makes absolutely no sense. - [#1] It depends on the context. Am I coming or am I going? - I'm so confused. I don't know whether I'm coming or going. What? - [#1] Even in this head room, you're bloody hopeless. - [Hank] What is this place? - [#1] This? This is life outside the bowl. - [Hank] What's it like? - [#1] Ugh, liberating. I swim this way and that way. I can go as high as I want, as low as I want. No more counting steps before I smack my face in that cruel glass. Best of all, I'm not swimming in my own crap. Now, the world is my toilet. - So how does this work? Are you dead? 'Cause you're definitely not alive back at home. - [#1] I'm not sure, but I do know one thing. I've never felt more alive in my entire existence. (whimsical music) - Do you know things? I mean, were you imparted with wisdom as you departed? - [#1] You mean, did my life flash between my eyes when that maniac ghosted me? - I mean, do you know the secrets of the universe? - [#1] I do feel calm, possibly enlightened. So, what do you wanna know? - Where do lost socks go? - [#1] Of all the biggest mysteries in space and time, you're asking about a garment that whisks away sweat from your foot? (#1 sighs) Over there. (music continues) - [Hank] I wish I was there to stop that cat. - [#1] I have no hard feelings towards the cat. The cat's a cat, the fish is a fish. Cats eat fish, dogs eat cats, it's the circle of life. - [Hank] Who eats dogs? (music continues) - [#1] How's life inside your bowl? - What do you mean? - [#1] I mean you live in an unnecessary bowl. Bloody hell, there's a whole world of possibilities just waiting to be explored. Some big, some small. Some, eh, whatever. But you'll never find out if you hole yourself up talkin' to leaves. - I don't talk to leaves. - [#1] Uh, hi, are you forgetting? I never left the bowl. - Okay, maybe one time? - [#1] Never, ever left the bowl. - Okay. Maybe sometimes I do. - [#1] Can we be done with all of this so you can put yourself out there? - I guess. - [#1] Watching you from that bowl day in and day out with nothing new or exciting in your life, I worried. - Thanks, #1. By the way, I had no idea you were female. - [#1] Hm. Well, I had no idea you were either. - [Hank] Wait, what? - [#1] Aloha, Hank. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (water rushing) (trowel thudding) (owl hooting) (Hank sighs) (wind whistling) (Hank thuds) (cat meows) (water splashing) (bright music) - [Bug] Hey. (soft music) (water trickling) (birds chirping) (Hank inhales) (wind chimes chiming) (swing creaking) (frog croaking) - Hey, Nobu. Good for the soul. - Good for the soul. Sorry about the nursery, Hank. - How are you feelin'? - Now or in general? - (chuckles) Both. - Rested, but feels like I should be doing something productive. - It's okay to just rest. - Yeah, I guess but in general, I'm not sure. (Nobu sighs) Aki has me document the day out on an index card what I ate, what time I ate, blah, blah. It's annoying, but I get it. - Jolene died. (Nobu sighs) - Aki told me. Very sorry to hear that, Hank. I know she was special to you. - You spent a lot of time at that nursery. How's life outside of it? - Being in this bed has given me time to think. Maybe too much time. I feel like a weight has vanished, giving me time to figure out the meaningful things in my life. Maybe Aki and I should have closed the shop more often, ventured out, seen more of the world, or simply done nothing and just enjoyed each other's company. I was going through an old photo album, and me, I was handsome fella. I had a lot of adventures, a lot. Then the world grows smaller. The nursery, the mortgage, the tax returns and on and on. It seemed... - Adventures? - Yeah. Yeah. That album reminded me again, there is a big world out there full of new, and exciting possibilities. You never know. One day you're walking in forest, the next you meet the love of your life. Oh (chuckles), don't worry. No sock of mine every accidentally goes missing (laughs). Yokai. - Yokai? - Supernatural creatures in Japanese folklore. Yokai existing beyond what he would see, and when you aren't looking, Yokai bring good fortune to the human world, but also wreak of havoc. A physical trait of most Yokai, their grotesque feet, and so they envy humans for theirs. Hatsuhana was a good Yokai, but like all Yokai, she was very jealous of the humans' soft, smooth and delicate feet. She believed that because humans wore socks, (speaking in Japanese) as they were called, they were able to have such beautiful feet. A Yokai from a neighboring forest, Kusunoki, was in love with Hatsuhana, and observed her every moment from a distance. Kusunoki watched Hatsuhana cry daily about her hideous feet until he could no longer endure seeing his love in pain. So he went to work, crafting the most symmetrical pair of socks in history. When Kusunoki gave the socks to Hatsuhana, she was so very happy, (cat meows) but her happiness would not last long. Once in the morning when she was bathing in the age spring, a human took one look at her cherished socks. When Hatsuhana told Kusunoki this, he vowed vengeance against the humans. (Yokai growling) Joined by his brothers and sisters, the Yokai reigned terror on earth in search of Hatsuhana's missing sock. Kusunoki presented each missing sock to Hatsuhana, but the socks were not the right match. - Why doesn't he just make her a new pair of socks? - Because of sock. Hatsuhana wore what's made from love. So, it can be removed without its mate. Kusunoki continues to this day searching for its one true match, leaving millions of people baffled by their one missing sock. And so, Kusunoki came to be known as the Sock Yokai. (Yokai growling) - What happens to the socks that she rejected? - Kusunoki hides them, never to be seen again. Me? The Sock Yokai thinks he's outsmarted me, but I just enjoy wearing mismatched socks. - So, because of love there's a missing sock? - Absolutely. If you can come up with more logical explanation, I'll pick the farm.
