This film is based on a true story Paul Krantz and Guenter Scheller hereby describe the course of events, so no misunderstandings may arise. Tonight we will take revenge Revenge on those we love and who betrayed our love. Then we, Guenter and I, will depart this life with a smile. That's the whole truth. "That's the whole truth." That's better than any confession. You've become quite a celebrity in a rather short time. "Youths, Weary of Life, Form Suicide Club" "Two of Four Members Found Shot Dead" "19-Year-Old Ringleader in Custody" "Pathological Motives Suspected" Tell me about the girl. Did you... ...you love her that much... Hilde? You write here... "I think that love drove me to the ultimate step" "There are girls of such... ...of such intensity that one is powerless to resist" What difference does it make now? Did this "suicide club" really exist? Were you the leader, or was your friend, Scheller? What does it matter? How come you're still alive? "Then we, Guenter and I, will depart this life with a smile" You don't know anything LOVE IN THOUGHTS Dear Universe, It all started at school three days ago FRIDAY We had detention That Friday was the first time Guenter invited me to the Scheller's summer house His parents were away and I was looking forward to the weekend OM SUICIDE Mainly I wanted to see his sister Hilde again And Guenter? I think he was already far away by then Gentlemen... You can leave now It's beautiful Bang, bang, old man. You're dead I hope my sister's here already. So do I Hilde! Hilde-girl? Maybe she's not here Maybe she's at the beach? I warned you! Where's Hans? What's eating you? Come on, stop it! If I find that guy, I'll kill him I haven't seen him in two weeks. Don't give me that I can smell the cook in this house. I fixed myself something to eat What's he doing here? Hello, Hilde This is Paul Krantz, the poet. You know each other We've met. That's possible This is like paradise I bet you've never even looked into one of these books So what? I'm just saying If I had this many books... You can have them They're all yours What's this? No idea. A weird horoscope contraption of my mother's Do you know how it works? No. Hilde does, though We talked about Jakob von Hoddis. The poet And Georg Heym The time we met. You still want to talk about them? Is Hans your boyfriend? What makes you say that? Well, the way Guenter acted... Hans, Hans... Hans is just Hans I thought they were such good friends These days all he talks about is you. He seems to think you're a genius Want to row across the lake with me? Dinner's ready! I'd like to read something of yours None of it's very good yet. Maybe some other time I'd like to now "To Love" I didn't ask you to stay. But you stayed I never asked you who you were or what you wanted You were simply there What do you want from me, love? Was I not stronger alone? And did I ever need you? But stay a bit longer. Not long, Just until they stop asking how I am And I stop saying, "Fine" Everyone can tell at a glance: You are here If you ever leave me I will go with you And? What do you say? Would you really? If I loved the person, yes. You believe in true love? Can you think up another poem? Now? Yes. One just for me What? Why the smile? A comely leg shows off a hem of pink. What a lovely, saucy sight Wonder what it might conceal, I think? When I dare to ask, she pales in fright My, my, Herr Krantz. You're a naughty one You want me to leave? No, no. I'm pretty tired anyway I'll return the favour Did I promise you too much? Paul... Come with me SATURDAY I'm going into town. Why? - I'm meeting someone... ... Elli? Oh, stay here with Paul and me. - You have a crush on him? No. He's a friend from school. What about you? Do you like him? We'll see. - Hilde. Yes? - Promise to be back by 8:00. Why? - I have a surprise for you. Bring Elli, Lottchen, Rosa, and the others, too. Yes, Great Manitou. By 8:00 at the latest! How's the water? - Is Hilde up? She's in town. She'll be back tonight Besides, she left something for you. Let me see. Come on, let me see! This book with your heart you wrought. A poet's soul you have, that's sure. Dark ideas to capture you have sought, but the rhymes are clear and pure. Yet you are young and to me it seems, that you are really just a boy Who's known love only in his dreams, And tarried too long to savour its joy You'll fail to win the girl you sought If your ardour in poems alone you show What use is love only in thought? When the time comes, you won't know You should save your bullet, you know. That's no reason the trigger to pull Far too many tears would flow It's just not worth it for such bull What does she mean, "Tarried too long to savour its joy?" That you won't deliver when it comes down to it My sister's not one for theory You think I should try a more direct approach? Yes NO TRESPASSING It's pretty obvious. She writes: "When the time comes, you won't show" "You won't know" Maybe she can tell you're a virgin Does she have a boyfriend? I hope not. Then why did she go to town today? Cause she knows you're hot for her and will wait for her all day She wants you crawling to Berlin, begging for a moment with her She's crazy Hilde likes you, trust me. She has a thing for proles Hey, jackass! May I speak to Hans, please? From the kitchen It's me I was out in the country. With my brother, who else? Your son's repeated unexcused absences from class are a matter of concern Is that so? Don't make such a fuss. I'm coming See you later Elli! Get changed, we're going to the Mokka Efti! What, so early? Fine, I'll be right over! The Mokka Efti is no fun anymore. Who's coming tonight? Some of Guenter's friends. Rosa. Lotte... and Paul He's coming, too? Yes. Nice chap. Handsome, too Maybe a bit shy, but... He stayed the night with us And? Well, you know me Maybe you'll find one, too. Well, you know me Well, look who's here. Oh, it's you You're not dancing. To that music? May I join you ladies? Go ahead. I was just leaving anyway Perhaps you'd care to join us? Some other time, maybe What about you? Just a teeny little glass? At the next table... All right Hey, doll. Hey, soup boy I'd almost given up on you Ten minutes, okay? Where were you last night? Wouldn't you like to know Today I won't let you off so easy I'll come over later. You can't I have to go back to the country. I promised Guenter Now that your parents are finally away, your jealous brother has to spoil it Tonight... I'm staying I'm serious. So am I Are you in love with Hans? I don't know Such things quickly pass Never to return Maybe it's true... ...that people are only truly happy once in their lives Just once And then they are punished for it For the rest of their lives The punishment is that they can never forget that one moment I think it's best... ...to say goodbye at the right time Namely when you're the happiest Precisely then At the zenith How quiet it is here Dear posterity, These are the statutes of our suicide club The members are Paul Krantz and Guenter Scheller First: The name of the suicide club shall be Fehou Second: Love is the only reason for which we are willing to die Third: Love is the only reason for which we would be willing to kill Therefore we swear to end our lives once we no longer feel any love And we will take all those along who robbed us of our love. At last! I thought we'd have to bore your friend with jokes all afternoon Oh, it wasn't that bad It's quiet today Could it be that you're not too unhappy about that? At least that way you know you'll be safe in this... jungle I'm afraid I don't understand. It doesn't take a Freudian to see that your many suitors scare you That's why you prefer to attack, right? I don't know what you're talking about. I can't believe that I don't care. I have better things to do than listen to you Come, we must leave Herr Zipfer to his insights Excuse me, Hilde-girl. I didn't mean to offend you By the way, your fear is quite understandable What a bang! Not bad They're crazy! Would you stop that, you idiots! Tell him to put on different music Don't drink, open the bottles! Why open them if we can't drink? Watch, guys Go ahead Coward It was just a bit of fun. Nothing happened, after all This is not a toy, Jango If any of us is ready tonight... If he's really happy... He can go And the others will help him do it Why when he's happy? Why not? All right, everybody Won't be easy to close that door again My parents haven't been here in ages Say, where's your sister, anyway? No idea. She should be here by now I came to pick you up. Sweet of you. Have you met Elli? We met once. You were with Guenter. We did? Never mind. Elli's used to that What's wrong? Are you okay? If you love someone, you love only him But if you limit yourself to one, he'll soon try to tell you what to do You're at his mercy. If he doesn't want you to study or work, too bad for you You can like many fellows at a time. This for one reason, that for another I heard if you can't decide, you become a lesbian The emancipated ones are lesbian, right? Right. And cola turns your feet brown You're... a silly little one The word "naive" doesn't even cover it. This needs more sugar I'm liberated, and for me, a handful of men won't do. I want a whole land-full You think committing equals weakness You're talking nonsense And later? What about later? No one will be there to take care of you. Parroting what that idiot said, huh? It's true, though Oh. is that sweet! Well, if you ask me, love as we know it won't exist 20 years from now We will progress beyond petty possessiveness We'll live in a free society and all love each other It's already like that in Russia But that's awful! Why? You have no political consciousness You do whatever your parents tell you . That's not true! What do you know, anyway? Hey, am I happy now? Do I have to go? Hello, Guenter! Hope I'm not disturbing you. What are you doing here? I heard rumours of pretty girls Are you alone? On the contrary Look what I brought along The green fairy! Where did you get that? Wouldn't you like to know. Anyone up for a little trip tonight? What shall we drink to? Paul Try this To the beauty of youth To us Have you ever had a girlfriend? That was a sad story. I see Want to hear it anyway? In that case, no One, two... And let it flow Sadly, it's simple. People come in two kinds: those who love and those who are loved. like my sister That's not the problem. What is, then? How long have you known Paul? I have no idea For... I don't remember Which kind is he? A bit of both, maybe What a beautiful night If we could stop time now... Right now, at this very moment It's perfect. There's everything we could want Let's just go somewhere I told you not to show your face again! Oh, come on And leave Hilde alone! Get out! Get out! Get out of my life Hey, what's going on? There's thirsty people out here Go away, Bittner! Guenter? Go on, scram Get lost Got you You're so beautiful I never want to belong to one guy only Not even you What use is love in thoughts What are you doing up there? The view is good from here Want to come up? I still have some left, if you like. Did you drink all that by yourself? When was it that we met? This last winter. At the Mokka Efti With Hilde and Guenter. And Hans You were there that time? We went to a movie afterward, but you didn't come along You were short on money... But the others didn't notice that Shit! Hey, Hilde. Not in bed yet? How did get here? Took the zeppelin Oh, you two know each other? You're right. It really is nice up here What, Hilde, no one loves you anymore? No one loves me anymore, either And no wonder Want a ride to the city? Why would I go to the city? The party is past its prime. You and your smart-aleck comments The city, anyone? It's going to rain soon anyway Has anyone seen Paul? Yeah, a while ago. With you, I think Oh, God. My car Hey, you old lush Hey, Paul How are you? Hey, Paul, where were you? Swimming How about you, Paul? Sorry, what? I can tell your future Come on, this is your chance I don't believe in that stuff. Afraid? Nonsense. Says you Sit down Only one question. The answer's inside you, I just help you find it Just one question. So consider it well Ask if you should become a teacher. Right How is that supposed to work? It's a... ...horoscope-mobile. It's controlled by your subconscious Pipe down, everyone It works through a kind of magnetism You have your question? Yes Give me your hands You have to concentrate. Close your eyes Everyone be quiet Now pose your question It's the Hermit What did he get? The Hermit What does that mean? Obvious. You'll be alone a long time What's that got to do with my question? That's your fate What was your question? Whether you'll outlive me, Macke That's a bunch of baloney Why do you all fall for her? I'd sleep with you Over there, in the woods I know you have a crush on Hilde But there's no need to pity me I don't You can go on ahead SUNDAY I'm going to school There's no school today, Elli Does the shirt fit you? I'm kind of hungry, actually Yeah, I'll go look in the kitchen. I'm sure I'll find something Anyone else want anything? Hilde, can you come with me? Don't feel like it We have guests. Come on, please Listen, loser. You can forget about my girl She doesn't like schoolboys. Oh, yeah? Sorry, but could you maybe look after Paul a bit? So he isn't so... Are you crazy? Don't get all in a lather Yesterday was swell, wasn't it? And besides, I have the feeling he's got a crush on you So what if he does? You're really... I'm serious, Hilde This is my last chance with Hans I'm going to bed. What? At 5.00 P.M.? Why? I'll sleep in the master bedroom Here, take this. Now we can relax a bit Where's your sister? She went to bed Why did she do that? She was tired You mean she's not coming back? So? We can ask the others to come by after school It's Sunday. Or we can ring at Elli's She lives two doors down. Crap idea What's the matter with you two? Ask Guenter what time it is Go on, ask him. What for? Just do it It's really hilarious What time is it? I've got to take a leak Again? Why? What time is it? Paul, don't you want to hit the sack? You can sleep here if you like You can finish your beer first. You're making such a fool of yourself You think so? It's me What was that? Hilde... Never mind them I'll protect you, don't worry I think I love you, Hans The zenith If you go, I'm going with you Paul Krantz and Guenter Scheller hereby describe the course of events, so no misunderstandings may arise Tonight we will take revenge Revenge on those we love and who betrayed our love Then we, Guenter and I, will depart this life with a smile That's the whole truth Dear Universe, A tiny piece of the whole will die Don't be upset You will barely feel the loss of one cell being extinguished Time rolls on What is such a little life? A brief flicker in the world, then merely ashes and dust I'm leaving It's just not worth it I'm going home You left long ago Hilde, open the door What happened to you? Where is he? If you mean Hans, he's long gone What did you do that for? Morning. Oh, you're not dressed yet. Morning Hello. Elli Hello Come What's wrong? They've been acting crazy all night I had to hide Hans. He stayed the night I have something to tell you, too Guenter Scheller was my friend probably the only one That crazy night we agreed that the four of us would commit suicide The fact that...that I later didn't ...that I later didn't believe in that possibility anymore doesn't change the fact that our thoughts were wrong it doesn't change anything The court will now withdraw for discussion The hall shall be cleared during that time The verdict: The defendant Paul Krantz will spend three weeks in jail for possession of illegal firearms He is cleared of all other accusations The time he already spent in jail during investigation will be taken into account Supplement by Guenter Scheller... Dear space... When we don't exist anymore, nobody shall miss us. Not even one tear shall be shed for us If anyone may want to remember us, he shall do it with joy. Because it's like this: we did the only right thing ...we lived In 1931 'Die Mietskaserne', the first novel by Paul Krantz, was published under the synonym Ernst Erich Noth. On the 10th of May 1933 the novel was burned by the Nazis during their book burnings. Paul Krantz fled from Germany on the 5th of March 1933 and went into exile. Hilde Scheller suffered what could be called a witch hunt after these events. Because of the obscene coverage about her she was forced to leave the city. She went on to become a librarian. Elli never got married.
