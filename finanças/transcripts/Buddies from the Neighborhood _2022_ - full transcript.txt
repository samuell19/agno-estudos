Now, let's go back in time. This is pretty much how all our games were like. Unlimited imagination, very limited means. İsmet, the enemy is holding the fort down. But trust me. I'm going to handle it with a little help. My cloak is bulletproof! Woe is me. I swear he's something else. School's out. He'll be like this all summer. Dragon kick! Why would a dragon kick, son? Have some reason! Is that your sock, Eko? Move! Your dad has athlete's foot. Don't play with his sock. Stop running! "ADAPTED FROM THE BOOK OF THE SAME NAME" Ugh, my head. I won't do this anymore. It's too much. BÜYÜKÇEKMECE MUNICIPALITY GARBAGE Hey! We're in İsmet's turf. Run, you all! WATCH OUT FOR İSMET - Hurry. Form a line. - Come on. - Come on. - Come on. Run, guys. If you had your fun, kids, since you're all already here, Chief has a question for you. Joining İsmet's gang meant getting promoted in the hood. Kids who wore the gang's necklace were privileged. And kids like us were… Enjoy it. - We want a few too. - Go get your freebies somewhere else! The necklace was an out for the discriminated. Thank you. Come here. It's him. Selçuk! You know how people draw the thing they want the most on the ground on Hıdırellez? We drew İsmet's necklace, and İsmet drew an arcade machine. The poor guy was deprived of the fun the entire neighborhood had. İsmet couldn't enter the arcade since his father had forbidden him because he didn't study. I'm getting an arcade machine this summer. I'm expanding the gang. Are there any brave fellows among you who might deserve this necklace? We don't mean to offend anyone We don't mean to disturb anyone We may touch some sore spots… Finally. I ironed your unused clothes. Hand them over to the poor. İko, I know you want to do good, but we're poor too. So me buying you stuff is already helping the poor. I'm sure Allah will count that. They'll handle it up there. I'm kidding, İko. Jeez. Ramazan's coming tomorrow. I saved this for him. Nazlı's getting married next month. There's a wedding? She's a close relative too. Eko, she gave us a bracelet at our wedding, right? You people should chill. How old is she, even? What's the hurry? She's 43. Two years younger than my mom. But she looks so young. I mean, did she wait all this time to make me suffer? Summer's the off-season at the cinema. We barely get by. We have to. She helped us buy this place too. Let's just give her two bracelets. Oh, no! Come on, hubby. What's wrong? Your face went all pale. We can always sell my gold if we don't have cash. No way! How can we save anything, then? The gold is our investment. We had this discussion already, right? Forget about the gold. That's our investment. I'm speaking Turkish. Do you speak it? Just relax, okay? Just relax! Be like me. Eko! You left the old clothes. We're dead, Ramo. We're dead! We need to replace the gold, Ramo. We'll be so screwed otherwise. How about you run back home and wear your shoes, Eko? What would İko think if she saw me like this? I can't act suspicious. Don't you know how smart your sister is? Of course I do, man. I didn't, though. Why didn't you warn me before the marriage? You should've pulled me aside and said, "Eko, you can't outsmart İko. Don't do this to yourself." Why didn't you? I had no idea you were like this. Stop lying! You knew I was like this the moment you met me. Eko, we need to get the money fast. Let me just work my magic. I'll go get some tips at the racetrack. Ramo, you really can't handle losing, can you? We're in this trouble because how much you love betting. - Of course not. - We don't bet anymore. It's all over. Joining İsmet's gang wasn't so easy. Move! We needed to take certain tests. Thankfully, I was good at soccer. My grandfather was a wrestler too. Everyone says they're the best with the blowgun… but I spice it up. He shot me in the tonsils. It's the final round. Wrestle. But, Chief, Selçuk's like a brother to me. Mom will be so mad if she hears. I wanted to give him time to speak. It wouldn't have taken long otherwise. How did you do that? My grandpa has an entry on the encyclopedia. I'm the great wrestler Ahmet's grandson. We wrestle at home as a hobby. - The necklace is mine! - No. I meant wrestle with Cemal, not with each other, dude. You should listen more. Don't you let me down. Come on, Chief. Come here, you! Selçuk! Shut up! Start tomorrow, Turgay. Turgay? Even Turgay's surprised. What are you talking about? Selçuk cheated. There's no such move in wrestling. Beat it! I said beat it. - What's up, fool? - It's called the One-arm Takedown. It's well-known. I didn't cheat. That means Turgay lost. Then, he's not in either. No one got in. How do you like that? See you. Why are you doing this? I deserve the necklace! Cut it out! You won't get involved in this. You're smart. Go study. What? Even the Ministry of Education doesn't think about my studies. Selçuk, no one would fear us if we let you in. Look at you. You're just too adorable. Open up. That's my boy. Suck on it. There we go! Wow. What a delicious finger. You're just like your dad. If you ever destroy your clothes again, I swear I won't even hesitate. You understand, Little Eko? Go pick up the phone. The phone? No, Mom! I swear you're scaring me, Mom. It beeps before it rings. You'd know if you were a bit smarter. Get up. - Hello? How can I help you? - Hi, Mrs. İlknur. We're at Serkan's. We're definitely not playing games. We're studying. Can Selçuk join us in not playing games but in studying so that we grow up to be successful? Am I right? You think Mom would fall for that? Hang on. I'll be there. Wait. Oh. It wasn't her. We got the wrong number. - Mom, I'm leaving. - Leaving where? To the Quran class. HOW TO READ THE QURAN You're just what we needed. Are you hungry? - No, but I can eat. What do you have? - A few cold rolls. That's the rolls' problem, not mine. I'll have them. If you weren't my friend's sister, I'd marry you tomorrow. - I'll find a way. - Selçuk, it's for you. Oh! It's for me, girl? - Who is it? - Your mom. Hi, Mommy! Yes, Mommy. I was just on my way to the Quran class, but then I… You're the best, girls. Then I realized I forgot all about the ablution. Why didn't I go back? Mommy, you know how Serkan's place is on the fifth floor? I must've thought it'd be closer to Allah, so… Your uncle's here. Come back. She'll kill me. That's my boy. Good boy. You're going to work at your father's shop, huh? Allah bless. You're the best. I didn't want it at first. I thought he was smart and he shouldn't waste time, but… His teacher had a word with us. Apparently, he had worked at the cafeteria the whole year to impress his dad. He had helped the sales skyrocket. The owner's rich now. His teacher begged us. He said, "He's too smart. He should do business, not study." "He'll be a doctor or an engineer at best if he studies." - Ramo. - Yeah? A teacher wouldn't say that. Maybe he said, "The kid's dumb. Don't have him study." I mean, Yunus is a bit… A bit naive. We figured as much, but we didn't want to upset the kid. When I found out he had a talent I haven't been able to discover, I took him in. Right? He'd take me in if that were the case. Makes sense! If Yunus made it, we can as well. He's stupid, you know. Yeah! We're even stupider. - I think I misspoke. - We'll follow his steps. We'll hide our stupidity until we prove ourselves. Did I get it right? We'll form a gang to impress İsmet, but we'll hide it from him. That means we're confused. Aren't they saving up on money to buy İsmet an arcade machine? Yeah, but it's just way expensive. What if we told them we did it and bought the machine? - Literal goosebumps. - He'll give us the necklace himself. Let's start making money right away. Are we getting jobs? Are we having us work at some shop? Dude, I'm not your parent. How would I have you work anywhere? I didn't adopt you. We're just a gang. We'll need a lot of money, though. I know. Your chief figured it all out. I have a plan, of course. - Tell us. - Yeah. Well… It's a long story, brothers. I have guests to tend to. I'll tell you at our secret place in the woods tomorrow. You don't have a plan. Shame on you. You think I'd lie to you? Allah forgive me. Hi, Mommy. Did Uncle leave? Yeah. They're at Grandpa's. Oh, wow. It matches your shirt perfectly. I think the slipper's trying to tell us something. Didn't I tell you not to lie to me? You did! I swear you did, Mom! You did! - Get up. - I'm sorry, Mom. - I promise I won't do it again. - That won't work. You'll go study the Quran every day so you won't have lied. I thought religion was a choice. That's for people who don't lie. Touché. I'm sorry. I swear they'll shove me all the way into heaven. I'm a gang leader. I'm no good. I'm a bad boy! Why are you talking to yourself? Have you gone mad? Alif, bah, tah, thah, jim… Did you say something, Mom? Good job, son. That's my boy. Dear Allah, I told them I had a plan, but it turns out, I don't. Please give me a plan, Allah. Please just give me a sign. Your dad's still not home. You know where to find him. Go. Come on! Does anyone fall for this anymore, Eko? Come on, man. This is so not you. Fall for what, neighbor? Just go ahead and pick one. Come on, Eko. You can't fool us. We know the rabbit is trained. He can't possibly pick an actual prize. It's all a ruse. Hey! Watch your mouth! Don't slander us. We're not scammers. Yes, you are. I did this for a decade, man. Pack it up. You told me we'd be rich. Go scam kids at the school or something. Only kids would fall for such a trick. I'm just going in, Dad. Where are the shoes? The couch is ready for you. Your pajamas are there. İko, you got it all wrong. I was just... Ekrem! Stop playing. If you leave these tomorrow, I swear… She left the rest to my imagination. She's ruining my dreams too. I swear, I should just sell these at the flea market or something. That's not entirely a bad idea, actually. Allah, please forgive me. The Devil tricked me. Dear Allah, thank you so much. I'm so grateful to you. RAFFLE BOX My father and I had found what we've been looking for. Any questions? What's this? I found it in the vacuum cleaner. It looks cool. It'll trick kids. It's a broken electric motor. No one would buy it. No one besides you and the manufacturer knows that, my dude. Once we put your Lego set and Serkan's model train there, I swear they'll be all over the box. No, man. The train costs as much as my dad's monthly salary. - I'm out of the gang. - No, you're not! Please, brother. Please sit down. Look. All they'll get will be nuts and candies. The train is just for show. Serkan! This is all in self-defense. Don't you want us to fend for ourselves? Are we idiots? Exactly! Damn them! They won't get a train for some loose change. I'll still bring just the box, though. Sure. Just put some weight in it. We'll figure it out. Where are we doing this? The only place kids are all alone and where our parents would love for us to go. Stop! Your prayers have been answered, folks. If you're lucky enough, you'll have the toy of your dreams for just some loose change. How, you ask? Just pick one and get what's written on it. It's that simple. Who wants to try? Calm down, guys. RAFFLE BOX It didn't even take ten minutes. The box basically prints money. How much did we make? Let's count it. Forty thousand liras. Five thousand to each of us. We save the rest for the arcade machine. Mine's so cool! Look at it. - What is it? - It wouldn't be cool if everyone knew. Exactly. Dude, this is so cool. It's the only one in the world, you know. İsmet shouldn't know about this until we get the machine. Don't you tell anyone we're a gang and stuff. We'll be dead if İsmet hears. Don't worry, Selçuk. Hear ye, hear ye! Some can pay in cash, some only in prayer! We accept both! This is a whole another day in the flea market! Come check it out, people. Come on! Whatever you want to pay, we'll take it! There we go. We'll sell your stuff tomorrow. We'll collect stuff from the neighborhood too. Whatever you want to pay, we'll take it! CLASS TOTAL CLASS TOTAL CLASS TOTAL Hey, İko. The guys love your kete. Please make some for them. With these hands? CLASS TOTAL Dear community, we have had a record number of new pupils this year. We can't even fit in the hall. The other day, Mr. Mufti himself called me and told me our mosque was exemplary. They're going to gift us an A/C unit. I mean… Thank Allah. I never imagined this day would come. Why do we keep accidentally doing good deeds? Go ahead and speak. You know how no one picked the train, the Lego set, or the handheld Tetris? - Everyone thinks it's rigged. - I noticed it too, Selçuk. No one got the big ones. Are you guys kidding me? - I told you. We don't put them in. - I still thought someone would get them. Half of the class skipped it today. We can't buy the arcade machine like this. We'll have to find a total stranger, then. He'll put his hand in, draw one, and bam, train! See? I told you it could happen. No, man. I can't give away my train. Dude, we're not going to! He's going to be in on it. We'll get it back later. How is he going to pick the right one? What if another kid draws it first? - All right. We'll do the handheld Tetris. - Okay, then. He'll draw my handheld Tetris. How, though? That part's a bit tricky. What do we do? What to do… How can we stop anyone else from drawing it? I know! You really get so stubborn sometimes, son. I just wanted to have a lazy Sunday. Are you really so desperate? Yunus is much younger than you. Right? I bet he'll listen to me since I'm older. Look. Don't go hard on him. Yunus is a bit… Allah forgive me for saying it, but… İko, what was the word we used instead of stupid not to offend them? It's naive. Yunus is a bit naive. Right? Thank you, Allah. Don't you try and one-up Ramo, okay? He can't handle losing. All right, İko. Okay, honey. Don't you worry. Here you go. Five to nil. Come on, Ramo! You just can't play backgammon, can you? You cheated. Another round. Sis, please say something. Thank you, Lord. Uncle, I'm going out to play with Yunus. Oh, really? Hey, Yunus. Wrestle with Selçuk. Do the stuff I taught you. Watch how my son wrestles. No, Uncle. We'll just play nicely. Are you scared? He's younger than you, Selçuk. Don't be scared. He's terrified. The grandson of the great wrestler is scared of wrestling, you say? Don't tell his grandpa. He's grown old. He can't handle it. He'll die! Son, why are you tearing up your clothes? I swear he doesn't usually do stuff like this. Come on, son. Hey! That doesn't count. His hand slipped. Do it like I showed you. Grab the ankle. Use the technique. Come on. You know this. He's just like his uncle. Is this all you've got, Uncle? You call this thing you made a son? Traitor! He's basically a toddler. Of course you beat him. If you're so strong, come try me. Come on, Selçuk! You just love to lose, don't you, Ramo? Come on, Ramo! - I'll wrestle you, Eko. Get up. - Oh, come on, Ramo. What are you doing? We discussed this. I'm just being a good host. I don't want to deny my guest's request. Come on, Ramo! Eko, stop. Don't. Where is he? Where did he go? It's just that I didn't warm up properly. That's a girl's push-up! Enough is enough, Ramazan! Why is he crying? Did you beat him up into this? They beat my father up. Was it worth it, Selçuk? Too far, man. Don't be ridiculous, man. Of course we didn't beat him up. Our fathers just wrestled. - Who wants to play Ninja Turtles? - Me! Dibs on Leonardo! Handheld Tetris! Cowabunga! Put the paper in your pocket. Water. Get me some water. My heart's pounding. It means trouble when it's not pounding, Ramo. Don't be a crybaby. You lost. Let's go, Dad. Hey, Cemal! Come here. - What is it? - The weirdest thing in the world. One of its kind. If you let me in the gang, it'll be yours. - It's already mine. - Oh, wow. You can do that? I'll just leave, then. - How much would this go for? - I'm not sure what it is. - If we find the right market... - Hey, Osman. - Where did you get this? - The raffle. - What raffle? - There's only one raffle. - Selçuk's gang holds it. - Excuse me? "Selçuk's gang"? I see a young man over there. He looks hyped. Come on, then. Come here. Can I draw too? It's the train! I got the train! I swear! Seriously? Read it carefully. It must be Tetris or something. Come on. See? I told you it could happen. He won. Stop playing around. Give him his train. - Relax, guys. - Selçuk? Here you go, brother. I'm handing it over. Here you go. Spread the news around. You can get the big prize. We're no cheats, guys. Now, who wants them? - Me! - Me! Let's just get this done. - What's going on? - Listen, Selçuk. You sure the idiot can carry it home? I hope he doesn't drop it, man. - What's in the box? - The train! I figured since it's rigged… It was Yunus. The "naive" kid. Selçuk… Selçuk? I take refuge in you, Allah! I swear my friends are idiots! - The train! We lost the train! - Catch him, Cemal. Come on. - Mom, where's Yunus? - Neslihan took him home. The train! Did he leave it in my room? Why would he leave his train? He took it. I should have a chat with your grandpa. He never got you such an expensive gift. How would Grandpa know what a model train is, even? He can't even say "train." Grandpa calls them "drains!" Come on, son. Don't be so upset. It wasn't Grandpa. His dad got him the train. Your dad will get you one too. Don't hate your grandpa, okay? Grandpa didn't get it anyway. It's Serkan's… Oh, honey. Calm down, son. Here it is! BUDDY TOY SHOP Have a nice day, sir. Serkan, look what I got you. Oh, brother. It was so expensive. Is all the money gone? No. It's not that expensive, man. With the rest of it, I bought a chocolate bar. - You have any cash? - Well… - If we pooled it together… - Which we'll do. We can get another bar. Would you really? We're back to square one despite all our efforts. Well… Hey, Selçuk. - If you're really that upset… - Yeah? We can take the train and put it in the other room so you won't see it. You guys are so thoughtful. Thank you so much. Anyway, it's done. Let's look on the bright side. Someone got the train. People will want to join the raffle. We'll have more business. We'll work double-time and get the machine. Who can stop us anyway? Who, I ask you! Hey, little man. Where's the train? What the heck? The train… The train… Grandpa didn't get the train. The train… He's so upset, Eko. I'm scared. He's going to hurt his grandpa if we don't get him the model train. He should. He has every right. Like, get him a wind-up toy or a handheld Tetris, maybe. What are you trying to prove? Why show off? I mean, a model train, İko? Might as well buy the kid some farmland. Yeah. It costs nearly as much anyway. I asked the toy shop. So expensive! He's just jealous of his friends. Serkan has one. Well, Serkan's family is wealthy too, but he can't play with it until he's older. They fear he'll break it. Well, Selçuk can play with it until he's older too. I'll stash it in the cabinet. I promise. Hey, you. Should we just get it? It's not an investment, İko. We'll buy once he's older. Fine. See? This is the difference between mother and father. I'll just sell my gold and buy him the train. Relax, honey. Do you think the toy shop is open? I don't think so. - I'll just go get it early in the... - Exactly. That's what I told him. I told him you'd pay him early in the day. Don't forget. Oh, wow. The price tag is still on. I could buy two gold bracelets for that! İko, I swear I'll… I swear I'll shed tears. See? Go give it to him so he loves his father too. Look at this mess! It looks like a barn! I can't tell if you're human or cattle. Get up! What kind of son are you? Kids are supposed to bring prosperity. Why didn't you bring anything? Just get up and leave! Get up. I'm having very mixed feelings right now. I won't beg you to stay. Leave! But it's your call. If lies are what you want, I'll tell you lies and hurt you. Nah, İko. You give it to him. Just in case. Or wait. We'll surprise him tomorrow. If you get good grades, it'll be yours. You can't play with it until then. Won't I ever get a chance to move on? The train has become my nightmare. The kid's not used to being happy. He doesn't know how to be happy, so the buffoon's just upset. Oh, you buffoon! It just doesn't have packaging. Brand new! Completely authentic! For half the price too! Here's the warranty. Keep walking. Come on. He's not here. He's gone. He's not as dumb as these two. He had them scout ahead. Smart-ass planned his escape beforehand. I'd never thought of that. He's so calculated. What a leader. Should I catch him, Chief? Just say so. Hang on, man. He'll come back. Relax. Why would he, Chief? It's clear we won't have a conversation. I wouldn't come if I were him. He's not you, though. Just get it through your skulls. Selçuk never leaves his friends behind! That's right. Allah! Mommy! It hurts! Mommy! I sprained my ankle. Don't slap me. Don't touch my foot! Here goes my ankle. Stay away, İsmet. Stay away or else. You know I'm a madman. Stay away or else. Did he fall on his head? Where's the box? I don't have it. It was my friend's. I said where's the box? What's going on? I've never seen you at the mosque. Selçuk, who are these? Buddies from the neighborhood. They were just leaving. Oh, is that so? I'm so sorry, kids. I thought you were fighting. I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt. Carry on. We shouldn't be surprised. Destiny is destiny. This was always meant to happen. I can't change my destiny. Come on, then. Oh, well. FIVE MINUTES LATER What the heck? How did we get here? Cemal carried you here. The rest of us walked. You just kind of passed out. Are you kidding me, man? I'd know if I passed out. I didn't even see anything. We didn't either. Tell us. Oh, no. The class is about to end. Now, think about it. What did we learn today? That we shouldn't lie or İsmet would get mad. And if İsmet gets mad… Hearts will be broken. Now, spill your beans. How much does the raffle make, lads? Nothing, lad. We just want to go to heaven. Just encouraging kids to study the Quran and helping them… FIVE MINUTES LATER Wow, man! It was like a gondola ride at the fair. So much fun. I had the weird feeling you get while the ride is going down. Sit down, Mete. Please. Serkan, do you want a ride too? I don't want you to be jealous. Hey! Are you playing games with me? You say you don't make any money, Mete. How did you get the bike, then? How do you know? It was hidden in the basement. - You bought a bike? - I call it the Jolly Jumper. The same model İsmet has, but mine's brand new. His is old. - What if your parents see it? - I'm not concerned. Enough! Stop with the nonsense. Whatever you make, I get half. Take it all. We were trying to save enough to get you the machine anyway. - Flattery won't work. - It's the truth, İsmet. We just wanted to impress you so you'd let us in the gang. Is the raffle so profitable? Mete bought a bike with the allowance I gave him. I bought an Amiga. - Seriously? - So… So the raffle is very profitable. We can pull off what these two can't, but only if you let us in. We have a deal, kid. Get the money, get the necklace. What are you doing, Chief? People will laugh at us. How can you let them in? Is not a question I would ask. Whatever you say. Get a few new boxes and speed things up. My guys can help you. The customers will run away if you don't hide the defective goods. We'll hire new people. - Burn! - What a burn! Look at me! I have a question. What is this? I'll take some time off and go to the flea market. The model train bankrupted us. We lost a lot of cash. We can barely buy a gold bracelet. Let's just do it already, man. Let me work my magic. I'm telling you, I have a solid tip. I swear… You really can't handle losing, Ramo. This all happened because of your "solid tip." Just get it together and accept defeat already, man. It's your Achilles' heel, Ramo. It's different this time. The guy who told me is betting everything on it. He says he's about to get fired and it's his only shot. If we bet every dime we've saved on horses after all we've been through, that just means we haven't learned anything, you know? It's happening, Eko. Use the outer lane. It's happening. It is. Here we go! We won! Allah! We did it! We won! We won, Eko. It's over. It's all over. Ramo, I didn't actually bet on the race. I figured I'd teach you a lesson. What? It would've been a big lesson too. You'd be like, "I'm sorry, Eko." I'd be like, "I didn't actually bet, dude. I'm a changed man." Oh, come on, Ramo. Why are you crying, man? Look. Am I crying? You are, Eko. You are. Oh, really? I had no idea. Oh. I guess I can't hold it in. Oh, Ramazan! We're dead, man! You'll be fine. I'm the one who's in trouble. İko will just divorce you, and they'll move in with us. It'll cost me so much. What have you done? I swear, man… Our first qualifying candidate is Hıdır. He can eat all sorts of bugs and withstand 220 volts of electricity. So interesting, right? He's not Raiden, man. Don't be ridiculous. And he eats bugs? Seriously? We didn't take his word. We put him to the test. He ate two roaches and a wasp. The wasp stung him, so he can't speak. So interesting, right? The baker's apprentice. He can see with his eyed closed. We're a weak team, man. Soon we'll have a kid who says he can pass through the wall. Someone already did? Did you buy it? We didn't take his word. We put him to the test. He failed. If all kids my age are like you guys, I have a bright future ahead of me. Listen, guys. İsmet's expanding the gang to get the arcade machine. We all want the necklace. That's why we're all here. We'll work hard. No one gets a cut until we save the money. If that doesn't work for you, beat it. He actually left. I did it on purpose. He failed the first test, but you didn't. Well done. Take the rookies to our mosque. The place is safe. Mete and I will go to the central mosque. Don't show them the trick. Hold on, kids. Why are you here? Are you thirsty? No, sir. - You want grapes? - You have grapes? Are you here to beg? To steal shoes, then? No, sir. - Salaam alaikum, Hüsrev. - Alaikum salaam. Don't you trust the youth at all? That's my nephew, Selçuk. - I see. - Yeah. Would I tell you if I were a thief anyway? Why? Can't thieves be honest? - Are you calling thieves liars? - Of course not, sir. My nephew wouldn't do that. They're good kids. I ordered you a sandwich. Eat it while it's hot. Oh, thank you. Get me a cup of tea as well, then. - Of course, Hüsrev. - See you. - Allah must've sent you to us, Uncle. - Don't say that. My wife sent me here. That's a sin, you know. Kids nowadays always want the best of everything. What he just said is such a sin. These grapes are something else, Selçuk. It must be because they're sacred. What are you doing here anyway? We just want to sell some toys to get some pocket money. You need Hüsrev's permission, though. He won't let us. He hates us. He's like a hawk. Relax! Look. Hüsrev might seem harsh, but he's actually a total softie. Just ask him the right way. Salaam alaikum, Mr. Hüsrev. Hope you're having a nice day. Alaikum salaam. I'm listening. - We need a few books. - By Allah's will. - Subhanaka. - So Are you looking for anything in particular? No. Just whatever Allah sent us. Well, he sent us the Torah, the Zabur, the Bible, the Quran. Which one do you want? The Quran is much newer in comparison. I'll take the Zabur. Hang on a second, mubarak. Please just stop. Mr. Hüsrev, we're looking for one of those booklets with the Turkish prayers in them. Oh, you want the bestseller. We have rosy ones, plain ones, and ones with lecterns on them. Any of them will be fine. No need for a bag. We have a box. - We'll just put it in this. - What's this? Well, one doesn't talk about this stuff, but you're no stranger, Mr. Hüsrev. We're just giving out toys to our destitute, poor, unwealthy, penniless, needy peers. We just tell them it's a cheap raffle not to offend them. Us kids in the neighborhood are just trying to do some good. What a good idea. Mashallah. More and more kids are joining the course. Allah bless. Allah forgive me. Come here, dude. It's clear. It's done. Tell the others. We have the money. Cowabunga! What are you kids doing here? You were supposed to get me an arcade machine. It's done. Just get the necklace ready. They're coming, Chief. Run! İsmet just flew. Hey, kids. Where are those rascals? İsmet just flew! They used to ring the bells and run, but now they just break the bells. - He's basically a gang leader. - He is, isn't he? Look, Güney. They're only scared of you. They only spared your building. Talk some sense into them. They'll get me fired, man. I'm just an attendant. I have kids too. I'll handle it. Don't worry. Let's go. I swear he flew. How did he do that? Just bow down for a second, Selçuk. I need to try something. Come on. I'll handle the rest. Just stay put. Kids, I can't get an electrician on a Sunday. Is your dad home, Serkan? I'm sure he can fix it. You could've left it at "He's not home." Why did you offer him help? We're basically fixing what İsmet broke. Serkan, stop being so dramatic, man. It's just a few cables. We need to go home, grab the money, and take it to İsmet. Hurry up. Darn it! Enough. You know what'll happen if I do it wrong? You'll try Unit 7, and Unit 20's bell will ring. I hate when that happens. Enough! You disassembled the radio. Did you get electrocuted? No. I think Allah gave me a shock directly. Why did you pull it apart? Well… I know! It's been broken for years, so I wanted to fix it. He's fine. Just get up. Don't scare your mom. Come on. I feel dizzy. I'll go make myself some airan. Yeah. Make me some too. I feel a bit off as well. My head's spinning and all. You're just like me, aren't you? You passed out when you saw the money, right? No. - Why would I pass out anyway? - From the joy. I passed out right away as well. Don't tell your mom. We're having a bit of money trouble for reasons I can't tell you. Well, we used to. I wanted to fix it so I could sell it. But when I disassembled it, I found tons of money. Wow, Dad. How could it be? I was surprised too. I sat down and thought about it. I figured there must be a rational explanation to all this, but there isn't. Because it's a sign from above, Selçuk. Grandpa brought that radio from Mecca. Allah must've put money in it so we could keep it. You think that's reasonable, Dad? Well, that leaves one other option, Selçuk. The manufacturer must've dropped their cash in it. I feel like telling you the story now. We bet one of your mom's gold bracelets on horses with Ramo. And another one when we tried to salvage the first one. I said, "This is not right, Ramo. We should spend Neslihan's money too." - You bet another one, right? - I had no other choice. I had to do it and pray I'd turn a new leaf tomorrow. Thankfully, I don't have to. We'll just carry on. So? Did you get the gold back? The jewelers don't work on Sunday. I'll get them tomorrow. I swear to Allah, son. I'll never ever bet on the horses again. Let this be a lesson to me. İko! I'm in a good mood, honey. Let's go get ice cream at the pier. İko? Hey, İko. So all the money is gone? No. It's not that bad, man. I bought this with the rest. This is too much, man. I swear I don't even crave chocolate bars anymore. Should we just ask for the money back? No one would believe we earned it. They'd think we stole it. I'm done, guys. There's nothing I can do. But there is something. It's our money, not your dad's. Five of us worked hard for it. He needs to hide it, and the banks are closed. It must be home. Can't you find it? If my parents were like yours… But you're not like us either. You're the last kid any family would want. You're just trouble. You're a burden. You're a pain in the butt. You're just telling me what I want to hear, but even I am not that perfect. You're a pain in the butt. I am? I feel totally hyped now! It has to be somewhere secure. Oh, Mom. You're smarter than this. Of course Dad would find it here. Even I did a better job. No one would check the radio if it weren't broken. Because no one checks something unless it's broken. I bet they stole it. Are you insane? We'd know if they had. You jealous or something? Let me know if you need anything. Leave, kid. Well, when do we get the necklace? Mete's neck is a bit thick. Make his a bit wider, please. We're not jewelers. You can't order stuff. I'm not. But Chief promised us. "Get the money, get the necklace." Don't you get it? You're going to study. Forget about this stuff. Don't worry. I won't forget this. I appreciate it. Let us know if anyone bothers you. So it was a lie? You're not going to let us in? You guys aren't gang material, kid. Have you looked in the mirror? Try it. What would people think if I let you in? You'll drag us down. You're totally a Güney and not an İsmet, man. Oh, is that it? You think I work for Güney? I don't, man. No need to fear him anyway. He's a nice guy. Fear Güney? Us? That's what I heard. You only spared his building. He thought it was because of him? My boss lives there, dude. I can't do him wrong. They fired him because he chewed loudly. The bosses just love to fire workers. We're not insane. But… But what am I going to tell the guys? Nice question. You know what you're going to tell them? "All we can do is…" "…to make money," he said. He told me we'd already given him the money he needed and he had the workforce. So there's… …no need for you. Because we don't need more money, man. Just let us in and earn more. What gang doesn't want more money? Fair enough. Since the raffle is so profitable… "…you can't do it anymore," he said! He made Cemal quit his job too. They're going to hold the raffle. Amazing. So we gave provided jobs to the bad boys. Why can't we be the bad boys, man? Everything just works out for us. Did someone pray for us by accident or something? This is hopeless. Good luck, guys. But they can't pull off the raffle without us. You guys? You? What can you possibly do that we can't? He still didn't let us in. He even shoved me on my way out. See you, guys. He won't let us in no matter what. This is hopeless. You're wrong. Hey, Yunus. I'm İlknur's son. - What's up? - Not much. Hear me out, dear cousin. - Next. - Come on. Can I draw one too? Oh, you're adorable. Go ahead. It's the ship! I swear! Let's check it. - Let me draw! - Me too! He'll surely kick them out. I'm glad you thought of Yunus. Thought of? I've never forgotten about him. Only Allah and I know what I've been through. You know what? Only Allah knows because it doesn't make sense to me. - Will Yunus be there tomorrow? - No, man. They know him now. His friends will go instead. How? What happened, Dad? Who are you, man? You're older than me. I can't be your dad. He's fine, Mom. He's just lagging a bit. Get up, Dad. Come on now. Don't scare Mom. Get up. Why are you two taking things apart? - Are you insane? - What? Oh. I just thought I'd check the weather before I went to work. - The TV didn't work, so... - Must be the wiring. The radio in Selçuk's room started working on its own too. On its own? The radio? İko, I'm kind of scared. Should we have the place blessed? Strange things keep happening here. I can't believe it. RAFFLE BOX SHIP - GAMEBOY - TETRIS - TRAIN - LEGO Oh, you better run! Get back here, you fools! You lost the arcade money! Get back here. Where are you going? No raffles from now on. You hear me? No raffles. It's over! Well, what more does he need? They ran out of cash too. Why not just let us in? - Should I talk to him? - No, man. They'll know it was us. Only İsmet has a job now. I guess he earns enough. Let's get him fired, then. The bosses were looking for an excuse. If İsmet gets fired, we'll be in. No way! You're kidding, right? Would İsmet miss this chance? We're not İsmet, Selçuk. We can't do that kind of stuff. You're right. We can't. What is it? From the looks of it, I've done a lot for you. I think you owe me a favor. Okay, then. One favor. Tell me what you want. İsmet didn't touch his boss' building while breaking the bells. Let's break it ourselves tonight. We'll leave this there as if they dropped it. You know no one else has this necklace. They'll figure it was İsmet right away. I bet he'll be fired. You really need to study, cousin. The nation will suffer otherwise. Turns out education is important, man. I was about to leave, but this is actually my place. Just leave, man! You had me confused for a second. You maniac. The attendant is here, folks. Let's see. Whose is it? - It's İsmet's necklace. - İsmet? No one suspected it was someone else. His boss wouldn't believe him. İsmet got fired. Who was it, then? İsmet wanted revenge. Everyone tried finding the culprit. And I mean everyone. Must be an outside job. We would've found him otherwise. Thanks. I appreciate it. Don't get involved. We'll handle it. I wish we could help. Sorry. I didn't see it. Serkan, Mete. You go wait outside. My guys couldn't pull off the raffle, and we need money until I get a job. If you still want it… We're one now. Come start on Monday. We need a lot of money. Don't you worry… Chief. What about Serkan and Mete? Forget the idiots. But, Chief, they know the trick too. It'll take longer by myself. I'd be faster if I had them. Get it while it's hot! Come on, Selçuk. Just tell us, man. What happened? Was he mad? Wait here. I'll be back. Here you go, sir. You're not kidding, right? We'll be in trouble if these are fake. Everyone saw them. And you guys said he didn't need us. I guess not having a job is tough. What? No. Oh, no. - It wasn't you, was it? - Of course it was, man. Who else could it be? Don't be scared. We've been helping them all day. They won't suspect us. I figured it all out. We basically betrayed him, man. How can I look him in the eyes now? You said you wouldn't lie to us. I mean, forget about us. You lied to the entire neighborhood. You slandered him! You wouldn't let me if I told you. I did it for us! You guys wanted in. Well, you're in now! This is not how I imagined it, Selçuk. If this is how it's going to be… İsmet was right. You guys really aren't cut out for this. I wish you weren't either. Suit yourselves. You can have them. Maybe you'll get a freebie. All of a sudden, the summer break had become boring. Even though it sucked to be on bad terms with Mete and Serkan, I was a part of the gang now. The electrician who fixed the bells offered me a job last night. He told me it was a very clean cut and I was just gifted. He said I could start tomorrow. I wish I'd done it myself, man. I'd have a job lined up. Listen, Chief. Don't get me wrong, but I heard cutting all those wires isn't easy. I mean, there are no witnesses, but people think it could be Serkan. I'm just saying. He fixed the bells we broke the other day too. There was no electrician available, so they had Serkan fix it. Why would he want to join the gang, then? Unless he's insane. Look who's here. Morning, Chief. Oh, wow! There's breakfast? I already ate, but still. Where are the others? They got spooked, Chief. You were right. They're not cut out for this. - What did they say? - Well, they didn't say much, but… Well, who cares anyway? - I thought they wanted in, but they don't. - Is that so? But they were so eager. What changed? My mouth's full. They probably couldn't live with the shame. Hey, listen. You're so lucky. You'll get some action on your first day. - Let's go, guys! - Oh, really? Go where? I'll ask one last time. My baby! My Jolly Jumper! I swear on everything dear to me, man. We didn't do it. - Where'd you get the idea? - Your dad's an electrician! I'm certain it was you. Don't you lie to us. Don't you dare. Allah damn us if we did it! I swear, man. Why would I lie? Why wouldn't you lie? The bum who did it wouldn't confess. Maybe he's not a bum. Maybe he's an honest guy. - Chief, I believe them. Let's go. - Watch it. If I know anything, either they did it… or they know who did it. Fine. Suit yourselves, brothers. - Selçuk. - Yeah? - Lesson one. - Yeah? You wrong one of us… you wrong all of us. Beat them up. No! I have something to say. I believe them. You told me we were one. You'll have to beat me up too, İsmet. Come on, then! I'll indulge you. FIVE MINUTES LATER Oh, wow! It's really as good as you guys said. Just like the gondola ride. I've never seen such cowards. Can't you stay awake for a sec? I can't even touch you. You guys just pass out whenever I stand up. Cemal, you guys take care of them. All right! Don't hit them. I did it. No! Enough. You know it took an expert. Mete couldn't have done it. I did it. Enough! Shame on you. So you guys did it, huh? Lying doesn't suit you, guys. - I did it. - Oh, come on. They all want to take the blame. Just tell me the truth. Only I knew where your boss lived. They had no idea. Tell him, guys. Why won't you tell him, guys? I was scared of losing the necklace… not scared of them. He's covering for them. I tell the truth for once, and no one believes me. Fine. Why did everyone suspect you, İsmet? - Because I have a bad rep, so... - No, man! Because I planted your necklace. As if you guys dropped it accidentally. Which one of you is missing it? I thought I dropped it at home. It was you? Surprising, isn't it? You just wouldn't let me in. I'm not scared of you. Come on, then. - Here I am, kids! - Run! They're attacking the kids! What did I just do, man? You see what I just did? What more do you want? I already confessed. I'm sorry. All right. I'll go talk to İsmet's boss. I'll tell him everything. I'll beg him to give İsmet his job back. Are we good? - You promise? - Of course I promise. You think I'd lie to you? All right. I would. Fine. I'll take Güney with me. If you don't believe me, you can always ask him. Come on, you guys. Come here. Whoa! Help! Not you, Mete! So you accidentally fired İsmet over something I did. He's completely innocent. Will you please hire him back? What's with the shrug, man? He didn't even bother to say no. He wouldn't speak, even. Well, you did the right thing. I think it was stupid. He doesn't know my dad, right? I hope he doesn't tell my parents. Don't you worry. I'll handle that. You're the best. When he said, "I'll handle that," I didn't think he'd tell them himself. I swear he's something else. Thank you, Güney. It's late. Your folks will worry. I'm telling you, you should be so proud of… Come here, son. Come on. Come here. I said come here! Okay. Oh, you. You told me you wouldn't lie and you kept your word. Well done. Are you serious? You did something wrong, but you made up for it. Really? Why are you so happy I got İsmet fired? It wasn't you. His boss was looking for an excuse. He'd just hire him back otherwise. Look. What we admire here is your honesty. Well done. Always be honest. Oh, my sweet boy. I'd die for you. I love you. Dad, is Mom serious? Of course, son. Honesty is what matters. Since you guys are so happy, here's some more honesty. - Remember the cash you found in the radio? - Yeah? I had saved that by tricking you into thinking I was studying Quran the whole summer. Oh, yeah? 10 MINUTES LATER Won't you congratulate me? Thank you so much for your honesty. Why me? Why? I'd never think I'd father the Devil himself. You're all sweaty, son. Oh, Yunus. Here you go. Get your prize. Come here, son. Catch him, Cemal! Right in the tonsils. Your gang split up. That's not good. It's such a shame, İsmet. I'm not the reason you got fired. Quiet. Don't scare the customers. Hey, Serkan! Hey, Mete! - What's going on? - They're in my gang now. You convinced me into taking them in, remember? They know the trick. But you didn't want them. They don't want it either. You're not to talk to them anymore. That's not your decision to make. They're my friends. Stay out of it. Watch yourself, man. They're in my gang now. My word is the only word here. Now beat it. We'll settle our score later. Beat it. Adults usually don't like playing games, and ones who do can't do well as the kids do. Because adults don't trust their pals as much as kids do. They can't help it. They had experienced betrayal. They had grown up. Oh, Yunus. Come on. Let's see your palm. SHIP Oh, come on! Don't be mad at me. Here we go. Where were we? Listen, İsmet. You didn't get fired because of me. - Your boss was already... - Hush. Relax. I won't go overboard. It'll just take a minute. Serkan, Mete. Beat Selçuk up. But, İsmet… We discussed this. You guys are weak anyway. Just a few slaps, and I'll let him go. We'll beat him up otherwise. Come on. I'm sorry, Selçuk. Don't be ridiculous. We're buddies. We did it for you anyway. He caught us after you left. So you'd get beaten up just to protect him? I admire that. I'll give you a chance, then. Just do the raffle, and I'll forgive him. You promise? I promise. We're one now. My word is the only word. You're not to tell Selçuk. You promise? Promise. You guys… To protect me? Come on, you two. Stop dragging your feet. Run, Selçuk. He won't chase you. We'll be the bait. That won't do, Mete. You and I, İsmet. I'm challenging you, Chief. I'm challenging the Chief here, everyone! I'm challenging the chief of the neighborhood! If you're not scared, come wrestle me like a man, İsmet! Of course, man! It's only our culture. That's how you should spend your energy. Well, I'll be the referee, then. A wrestling match! A wrestling match! Don't miss the fun! - Let's go, Chief. - Relax, man. İsmet! İsmet! They're cheering for him? İsmet! I grew up in this neighborhood, man. Oh, how they betrayed me. Thanks, people! İsmet grew up here too. They're smart people, man. İsmet is the sensible choice. I really missed you guys. I'll indulge you, you filthy brat. To your places, you two. We're already where we belong. Selçuk! Selçuk! Such idiots. I feel for you kids. You all are done now. İsmet! Come on. Well, I did mention we wrestle at home as a hobby. Wrestling is all about technique. Our first move is the Cattle Tie. No! His hand slipped. Again. The second? The One-Arm Takedown. No! That was a foul. Again! Come on! This move is called the Kipe. Selçuk, it's usually the losing side who wants a rematch. - Stop already. - No, Güney. I won't. Get up, İsmet! Come on! And this move is called… Well, it's called… It's called the Whatever Works. Come on, İsmet. Come on. İsmet, you won't come near Serkan or Mete anymore. The raffle box is yours. Use it until you find a job. Let's call it even. You don't really know me, man. This isn't something I'd do. But you keep the box. Your gang needs the money too. I don't have a gang, İsmet. I just have buddies. They're my buddies from the neighborhood. See, a gang is different. I'm glad you didn't let us in, İsmet. It turns out, all I needed was right there all along. Just a few buddies from the neighborhood. You can't buy them. They're a gift.
