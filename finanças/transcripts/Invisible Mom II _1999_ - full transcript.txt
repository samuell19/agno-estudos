It's a fine thing to trust your lawyer more than your own niece and nephew. - Know any good jokes? We could probably end this right now. - Behave yourself, brother dear. - Olivia, Bernie... - The name is Bernard, Uncle Randolph. - You want my money, don't you? [thunder booming] Get your keisters over here. - Here we are. - I've got eyes, girl. You're your father's kid, all right. Little drama queen he was, and god rest his soul. You know exactly how much money I've got, right? - 3.24 billion in cash and liquid assets. - I expected you'd know it right down to the last penny. - Is there anything that we might do to ease your suffering? - Yes, there is, girl. Come closer, both of you. I'm not going to leave you one thin dime. [thunder booming] Tell 'em, Pres. - Come with me. - What's this nonsense about our not getting any inheritance? - We're his last living relatives. Who else could he give it to? - His only other living relative. - Who? - Who? - You both know about Mr. St. John's only son dying in a car accident 12 years ago. - Of course we know about that. Cut to the chase. - Even though he hadn't spoken with his father in over a year, he still was sole beneficiary to Randolph St. John's estate, until the accident, of course. - All right. Forget the chase. Cut to the credits. - Patience, Bernard. Go on, Mr. Preston. - Well, it seems the young man left behind a widow and a young son, who Mr. St. John had never seen. Edward, I believe, was the child's name. - I heard that the baby had died. - There's no death records for an infant named Edward St. John. He's out there somewhere, and I've hired a private investigator to find him. Let's see. By now, he should be about 12 years old. - In the meantime, we're supposed to cool our heels and wait? - This search of yours could take months, years. - You'll be pleased to know that Mr. St. John has given me until his passing away to find little Edward. Who knows? You may be lucky yet. However, with the computer-assisted tracking, we're likely to find the boy by this time next week, or maybe even sooner, at which time all of this goes to him. - You're enjoying this. Aren't you? - Immensely. You might think about packing your things now. Avoid the rush. [thunder booming] - I knew this would come back to haunt us one day. You were supposed to take care of that little brat. - I cut the brake lines to the car. - Keep your voice down. - I arranged the accident. How could I have known his wife would suspect foul play and go into hiding? She knew we would come after that baby. - What's done is done. We need to do some damage control. - If that investigator finds that little brat, we're done for. - Perhaps not, brother. Accidents happen all the time. You could say that they run in family. - Dear sister, I love the way you think.

We have placed over 1,000 children. Oh, and isn't it a lovely atmosphere? The children love to come around the fountain. Of course, they all know how to swim. Oh, they're just beautiful. It's so nice you've taking an interest in one of our older kids. Normally people only want the babies. - William and I have discussed this at length, and we both agree that this is the way to go, haven't we, William? - Yes, dear. - None of this 2:00 a.m. feeding and diaper changing nonsense of us. Isn't that right, dear? - Yes, dear. - Then I have just the young man for you. He's one of our best and very clever. His name is Edward. He's quite advanced for his years. - He's not what you call a problem child, is he? - Judge for yourself. Eddie, it's Ms. Mason. - Come on in. - After you. - Hello, Edward. I'm your mummy. - Where you are and await arrest. - Intruder, stay where you are and await arrest. - Ahh! Ohh! - Eddie, you little brat. Ohh! Oh, get your hands off me. - Stay where you are. - You--you are... I just had my hair done, you little monster. Oh, you blew it big-time, buddy. We were going to adopt you, but not now, mister. - Oh, gee. What rotten luck. - Is-- is that a smirk, William? - I wouldn't know what that was, dear. - I'm terribly sorry about all this, Mrs. Robbins. Perhaps one of our other children-- - "Other children"? If that little demon spawn is any indication of the horrors in this place, I-- come along, William. We're going to adopt a puppy dog. - Yes. - You are laughing at me. Aren't you? - With you, dear, with you. - Oh, shut up. - Sorry about that. It's been a pretty rough week. She's been a little on edge. - And you, I'm sending you my cleaning bill. Come along. - [laughs] - That makes four sets of prospective parents that you've scared off in the past six months. - Yep, four for four. - Why can't you direct your intelligence in other, more constructive ways? One would think you don't want to be adopted. - I don't. I'm waiting for my mom. She's coming back for me. I know she will. - Eddie, it's been 12 years since your mother dropped you off here. We haven't heard one word from her in all that time. - I don't care. She's coming back for me. - Eddie, you can't stay here forever. Now that you're 12, there are a new set of state guidelines to follow. You've had four chances at adoption, and the government requires that we place you in foster care. - Foster care? No way, please. - And after that, you'll have to go the youth farm until you're 18. - But I want to stay here. - My hands are tied. It's the law. I wish things could have been better for you. I really am sorry, Eddie. - Yeah, me too. - Hold that, Josh. Hand me that test tube. Ah, finally. - Karl, Josh, dinner. - After all these weeks, after all this trial and error, it's ready.

Anyone with any information is asked to contact Mr. Preston. Further proof will be required if you want to get rich off this little guy.

Hello? - Mrs. Griffin, this is Deborah Mason at the New Horizons Orphanage. Have you got a moment? - Oh, Ms. Mason, hi. Well, actually, we were just sitting down to dinner, but sure. I have a couple of seconds. Is this about another foster child? - Yes. Your family did such a wonderful job with the last two young people that I placed in your care that I was wondering, would you be so inclined to take on a new foster child? - Oh, well-- - His name is Eddie Brown, and this orphanage is the only home he's ever had. I know that your family could give him the love and attention he needs to make the proper adjustments. Would you be interested? - Well, I'd have to discuss it with my family. You know, we had such a good time with those other two kids. I'm so glad they found a good home. - I know you'll have as good a time with Eddie. He is 12 years old and very bright. I think he'd make an excellent little companion for Josh. - Well, we'll talk about it tonight, and I'll call you in the morning. - That will be fine. Looking forward to hearing from you. Goodbye. - Bye-bye. - Was that Ms. Mason from the orphanage? We haven't heard from her in a while. - Yeah.

Now, now, just breathe deep, Laura. All right. Come on. Breathe with me. Come on. Breathe. Yeah, oh, that's better. - Sit down.

None of the test I've run on you can explain it. - It's okay, honey. You know, as long as I just don't get too excited and I do my meditating and my yoga, I'll be fine. - Maybe we should tell Ms. Mason to find another foster family for this boy. - No. I don't want to do that. I don't want this to get in the way of helping that boy. - Are you sure, Laura? - Yeah, let's do it. Josh, what do you think? - It's cool with me if it's cool we everybody else. - Good.

His mother must have changed his name in fear that something bad might happen to him if his true identity or whereabouts were known. - Imagine that. - Where is he? - Not far. He could be here as early as tomorrow. - But you arrive too late. Under the conditions of the will, you were to find him before the old codger-- before Uncle Randolph passed away. - So you're a day late and a dollar short, Preston, old buddy. - Oh, I may have arrived here after the fact, but the boy was located earlier this evening, just in time, a matter of fact. Once again, sorry. The boy will be here tomorrow, and as executor of the estate, I'll be making sure that his transition here is a smooth one, which means having the two of you packed and out of here by noon tomorrow, which shouldn't be too difficult considering all you'll have are the clothes on your back. Sleep well. - Oh, Mr. Preston. - Yes? - Didn't you say that you were going to look after the boy's care? - That's right. - But aren't we his only living relatives? - And if we petition the court, wouldn't they grant us sole custody of the child? - And wouldn't they wonder why you had shut us out, perhaps to control the family fortune for yourself? - You are sly devils. I'll give you that. All right. You've won for now, but I'm not letting this rest. - Such diligence. - Ever the consummate professional. - Now get out, and draw up those adoption papers. - We must do this quick. We must get rid of the little brat with one very convenient... - But very natural-looking... - Accident. - Don't boys always climb trees and then fall out of them? - They also stick their fingers into light sockets. - Or they trip over staircase railings. - Yes, leaving us as the sole owners of the estate.

Nice to meet you. - A pleasure to meet you too, Mrs. Griffin. - Well, a very well-mannered young man. - Mm-hmm. - Josh, Karl. - What do you think, Eddie? - It's a cool house. - Guys, this is Eddie Brown. - Put her there, pal. I'm Karl Griffin. - And this is our son, Josh. - Hey, dude. - Hey. - Well, it looks like it's time for me to let you all get acquainted. You okay with everything? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I'll be checking in every now and again to see how things are going. Take care. - Thank you. - Thanks. I appreciate it. - So, Eddie, you're going to be sharing a room with Josh. You want to show it to him? - Yeah, sure. Come on. Hey, you like "Death Race" comics? - Yeah, cool. - Cool.

That's awesome. - Yeah, man. It is the second floor. So you like horror movies? - Heck yeah. Have you ever seen, "Lizard Brides From Saturn"? - Never heard of it. - It's, like, the coolest of the all-time horror flicks. They show it sometimes on the weekends. - Well, maybe I can get my mom to take us to the Olen Ray Theater this weekend. - Hey, check this out. - Play Slime. My mom told me that if she ever caught me with this stuff again, she'd ground me for a week. - Well, if parents hate it, we got to love it. - Yeah. I can tell you and I are going to get along just fine. But there is something I ought to tell you. Weird things happen here sometimes. - Weird things? Like what? - Well, like, sometimes when my mom gets a little stressed, and her blood pressure goes up, she turns invisible. - Invisible? No way. - Big way. You see, my dad is a scientist, and it all started when he invented this invisibility formula. - Yes. It looks good. Huh, Cosmo? [dog whining] You want to help Daddy with an invention? - First he tested it on the dog. - That's right, Cosmo. [dog barks] Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Wow. - Then I tested it on my friend's iguana, because I wanted to use the formula to sneak out of the house when I was grounded. And then I wanted to use the formula later, so I hid it in a soda bottle. Then my mom found the soda bottle, Well, you can guess what happened next. - [gasps] What? Oh, my gosh. - But she seems okay now. - Well, that's because my dad invented an antidote, and she returned to normal-- well, pretty normal anyway. - Gross. - Look at that. Amazing. - But it doesn't happen as often as it used to. She just fades in and out every now and then. - Hey, is there any more of that stuff hanging around? - Nope. Government came and took it, and that was that. - We could have had some major fun with that stuff. - Yeah, right. [crickets chirping] - He seems like a nice kid. - Yeah, he and Josh have sure hit it off. I think he's going to be a good friend for him. All those years in the orphanage must have been so hard on him. I just--I want to make it up to him, you know? - Have I told you lately how much I love you? - Better be careful talking up a woman like that. It could get you into more trouble than you bargained for. - Oh, Mrs. Griffin, I thrive on trouble. - [laughs] You just remember that until I get back. I'm going to say good night to the boys. - Hurry. - Whew. - Okay, guys, bedtime. Cute. So, Eddie, I'm never going to take the place of your real mom. I'm not even going to try. I just want you to know you have a home here for as long as you want it. - I like it here, Mrs. Griffin. You guys are so cool. - Yeah. Well, you're pretty cool yourself, kiddo. I think we better take this off to go to sleep. What do you say? Okay, bedtime, both of you. Just because it's summer vacation, there's still plenty to do around here. Good night. - Good night, Mom. - Good night. [thunder booming] - Bernard. Bernard. Oh, there you are. I need you to show me how to work the sound effects system. - I can't go through with it, Olivia. I can't send this poor child to a cold, early grave. Goodbye, dear sister. Goodbye. - [gasps] [shrieks] - Mu-ha-ha-ha-ha. Boog-a, boog-a, boog-a. - Ahh! Ahh! Ahh! - Boo. - Uhh... - [laughs] - You nearly scared me half to death. - Well, then I only did half a job. Didn't I? - Save the comedy for later.

We were rehearsing. - Oh, really? Rehearsing for what? - A scene... a scene we're doing for Uncle's funeral tomorrow. - Yes, he was such a fan of the theater that we thought we would share a scene from his favorite play with the attendees. - And what play would that be? - What play? Yes, of course. - George Bernard Shaw's... - Bernard. - George Bernard Shaw's "Man and Superman." - I don't remember that play having any screaming in it. - Well, this is the modern version. Now, if you will excuse us... - Well... - We have a lot of work to do. - Oh, I dare say. Oh, this dog. Take your dog with you, huh? Good night now. - Ooh. Well, I don't know about you, Lester, but I think those people are downright weird. - "Man and Superman"? Why didn't you say, "Macbeth"? At least they scream in "Macbeth." - How would you know? You're illiterate. - I am not. Mommy and Daddy were married. - I think they're up to something. We'd better keep a close eye on them. - Okay. If you put the soap on now and let them dry, they'll wash themselves right after the meal. - I'm not too sure about this. - Oh, trust me. All my inventions work. Okay? Now, let's put them back. - All right. - [grunting] [grunts] Ehh! Ahh! Ugh! [grunting] Ugh! Ahh! [both grunting] - You've been out in lab all morning. Anything come of it? - I've been going over the blood samples we've taken from you since you drank the formula. The potency of the invisibility potion appears to be lessening. I think one day soon you'll be back to 100% normal. - [mumbling] - Mm! Oh! [coughs] Honey, what did you put-- what is this meal? - Josh! Eddie! - Boys! - Get down here this minute. Somebody's got some explaining to do. - Told you you shouldn't have put soap on the dishes. - How was I supposed to know? - [coughs] - [spits] - Oh, no. If I don't get this stain out Josh is going to kill me. This will do the job. It's ripping it. Oh, great. Oh, no. Whoa. That's a big hole. Oh, jeez. This is going to be big. Well, you can look at it this way. It will be cooler in the summer. - Not exactly one of your brightest ideas, Eddie. - I can't do anything right. You guys have been so cool to me. I mean, all I want to do is help out. Nobody at the orphanage treated me like you guys do. - Yeah, I can imagine. I did a day at New Horizons Orphanage myself. Right after my mom drank the invisibility formula, the state stuck me in there until we could work some things out. - Really? Then you know what it was like. I mean, sometimes it was okay, but it was really fun messing with the dweebs that tried to adopt me. - You don't want to get adopted? - No. Because my mom is going to pick me up. I know it. - What was she like? - I don't really know. She left me when I was really young, but I do have a picture. - She's pretty. - Yeah. - So why did she leave you there? - Well, Mrs. Mason said it's because she couldn't take care of me. Maybe I messed things up even then. - Hey, man. You're just trying to do the right thing. That's all that counts. - Well, I'm sorry about messing up your jacket. - Oh, don't worry about it.

Where's my son? - Regrettably, I've drawn up adoption papers. His cousins Bernard and Olivia, they've petitioned for custody. - No. Those two are the reason I put him in hiding in the first place. If they get their hands on him, they'll kill him the way they killed my husband. - You can prove they murdered your husband? - I don't have to prove it. I know it. We have to stop this before they get to him. - Mrs. St. John, come with me. - It's just me, dude. Man, this is some kind of weird place. - I hate it. It gives me the creeps. - Easy, buddy. It's just a house. - No way, man. They said it was haunted. - No such thing. - Let's just relax and hang out until morning. - I don't know, Josh. - Come on, it will be fine. Night, Eddie. - Night, Josh. [thunder booming] - I had no idea these things were so uncomfortable. - Quit griping. It's well worth it. Remember, it has to look like an accident. - Does anyone ever told you you have a terrible habit of repeating yourself? - Oh, don't be such a smart aleck. Ohh. Ohh.

You'll need some financial guidance, and I'd be more than happy to continue on in your employ. - Yeah, sure, whatever. - What's the matter, Eddie? This is a great opportunity. - I guess. I mean, I have to live in this big house all by myself. Josh can't live here, because he's got his own family, his own home, and his own mom. - Oh, Eddie. I will always be here for you. You guys can get together whenever you want. - Really? You mean it? Cool. - Hold on now. Did I say you were going to be living here all by yourself? Not on your life.

Mrs. Mason told me about you. Thank you for taking such good care of my son. - He's a good kid. - You know, I'm a little confused. It might not be any of my business, but where have you been all of these years? - In hiding. You see, after Eddie's father died, thanks to his cousins, well, I couldn't prove it. I knew they'd come after us to finish the job and wipe out any inheritors. There I was alone and penniless. I knew I couldn't keep Eddie safe unless I put him away in hiding. So I went to the orphanage, and I changed his last name. And I prayed Bernard and Olivia would never find him. - And when they made such a big deal out of adopting him after Randolph St. John passed away, I knew it was just a matter of time before Eddie met up with a quote, unquote unfortunate accident. - When I heard about Randolph passing away, I knew it was time to surface. I tracked down Mr. Preston, and here I am. Eddie, I'm sorry it took so long. Can you ever forgive me? - You're my mom. - Well, I guess that settles it. We have papers to sign, but that can wait for a day or so. I think there's more important things to take care of right now. Good night all. - Good night and thank you. - Good night. - Oh, wow. What about you, honey? Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine. I think the serum has finally worn off. - You know, I kind of like this wraparound look.
