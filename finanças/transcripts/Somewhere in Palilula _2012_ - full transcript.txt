You go ahead, I'll follow. - Thank you. Good evening. - The Party is on our side! - Professor, the top class restaurant "Grandiflora" was here a long time ago. The owner was Bartolomeo's grandfather. - Ilie, tell us the story with the donkey. - What's it like, Ilie, to be alone in a restaurant? The only one getting served. - Grandiflora... I drink brandy, I drink wine. Water is no friend of mine. Long live our lazy bones. Come on! - Ilie went nuts back then. He sold the sheep and drank away the money at Grandiflora. With his donkey. I drink brandy, I drink wine. Water is no friend of mine. What could be sweeter than a moonlit, linden-scented summer night? True, there were no linden trees in Palilula. But we had oleanders. Gogu loved oleander. As soon as it got warm, we went out and partied till late in the night. I was glad my dad was there, too. He must be happy, I thought. In the summer, the Boema terrace became the hub of the world. And the full moon blew our mind. Where's Ilie? - Who's that? Isn't that Capra? And that one next to her? - Damn you! - Damn that motherfucker, I should have killed her. - She got Pantelica killed, I'm sure. - She bit me! - Now you're gonna grow a tail and tits. - Who was that? I thought... - No one. She was alone. Damn you! I went to the cemetery to hold Pantelica's place, so he could come and have a drink with you. - Professor, Pusa loves you. Would you spare some change? - Petrica, leave us alone. Can't you see how tired he is? - She is wonderful. It would be a pity not to. - Make our mouth into funnels and our stomach into barrels! Watch out, Soul, I'm going to drawn you! Long live our lazy bones. It was a fly, damn it. - Ilie, tell us the wolf story again! - The wolf story. The professor doesn't know it. - Listen here, man. This is incidental. I mean, it's a real incident. I'm not lying! In 1953, it was a harsh winter. --fucking wolf! - Boy, what are you doing here? What are you doing next to these dames, these men? Is that why you studied so hard? - And you? What are you doing here? - Who's there? - Capra. - Go home. Serafim... Serafim! Wake up. The hags have castrated Barza. Speak clearly. Who castrated who? Cover up that face. - Sing, girls. Sing. - Our Capra is pregnant. We're finished. - That idiot freaked us out. The hags haven't castrated Barza. Barza castrated the billy-goat. Now the hags want to kill him. Let's go. - Eat this. This will give us strength. - And tonight we will receive the holy gifts. Barza lived with his hags, his sister and Mitica somewhere in the wilderness, among the flies, by the pond. They were Italians, settled here who knows when -50, 100 years ago. Bartolomeo's grandfather had brought them over. They were housepainters and masons. Now they bred frogs and sang like angels. Barza was dirt-poor. But once a year, a miracle came upon Palilula. On the night of the Holy Gifts, somehow, Barza would become as rich as Croesus. His generosity then knew no bounds. There were all kinds of rumors, like he had a deal with some Italians who came here for hard-to-find stuff: mushrooms, fireflies, wolves, who knows. And Barza sold them frogs. On the night of the Holy Gifts, they delivered the money and picked up the goods. And it was real money, back then. And after that Palilula would party like mad. - Hello, patients! - Good evening doctor! - Have you eaten? - No, we haven't! - Neither did we. Long live the 23rd of August and the night of Saint Bartholomew. Play it, guys! Play it, guys! We got this frog tradition from the Italians. Here in Palilula we eat them too. And what a feast! The boys drag them out and chop their legs. They undress them, boil them and we eat them. Thousands of them. Turn that thing off! Comrade Gogu! Is she really going to die, boss? Poor woman. - Easy, Ilie, you'll get wasted before midnight. - Boss, it really moves me... Don't cry. It's just a play. - Doc, why don't you pay me a visit? I got a butter stew You should not eat that crap. Isn't this woman dying already? - Shut up, we want to hear her. - It's no good. She's not dying. Just look at her. - Barza, come on the drinks are cold. Get up Ilie, she's dead. What the heck... That one was alive. - No Virgil, that was the frog's soul. Garofita! Garofita! I'm not going. I don't wanna lose my place in the queue. I'm not going. Garofita! - What is it? - Venena drowned in the pond, apparently. Garofita! - Shut the hell up! Viorica! - What do you know. Garofita! Viorica! Garofita! Viorica! Garofita! Viorica! Garofita! Viorica! They searched for them in vain all night. At dawn, the Hermaphrodite saw them dancing at the bottom of the pond. Venena and Separanda, the two vipers at the drugstore, were gone for good. Laurel and Hardy, their husbands,, never sobered up again. Kiki! One stormy night, this Kiki showed up out of nowhere. I instantly hated him. He reminded me of someone, somehow. - What could be sweeter than making love, and dying in your sleep? - Come on, doc, take a photo of me with Jesus Christ, so I can send it to mom! Alright, the photo's done. Look, poor Ilie is dying. He's dead. They're all dead. Beware of the frogs' revenge. Palilula is a desert now. Everything's burned down. - What do you mean, they're all dead? - They're all dead, just like that. Poor Barza... He had a thing about flies. And poor Ilie... Run over by the train. Bartolomeo... Gogu... - I don't understrand... - The Party does not teach you to understand? Why do you think Kiki brought this camera along? You never wondered why? Didn't I tell you not to come here? Didn't I tell you to run away? Didn't I tell you we didn't need pediatricians here? You didn't get it, and now Capra is pregnant. Wait till the big fire comes, then you'll see. - Me too? - You too. You'll burn in a different fire. Your guts will burn. Mushrooms and oleander are pure poison. - What's going on here? Bloody doctors... You can't even pull a tooth out! You're siding with the Americans. You turned the Party into a dumpster. - Did you see he's growing new teeth? - Yeah man, baby teeth... What do we do with him? - We retire the fucker, what else. For the second time in its history, Palilula regretted not having a fanfare. After years of toil, Pista Herzog felt the sweet taste of triumph. - His dream came true. Is it serious? How much time do I have left? - It's serious. That's why we're retiring you. - What's my disease? - Cerebral atrophy. Look... You worked so hard for the Party. Passed it on to us in perfect condition. We messed it up. You fought to rescue it. So your brain... You know how brains are wavy, like. Yours is no longer like that. It's as smooth as paper. Because of your work for the party. - That's what my sacrifice got me. I never took a step back... ...and for what? I worked so hard so you could benefit from my sacrifice. - Look how well the X-ray machine got fixed! After Trotsky's retirement, the promiscuity of Palilula experienced a strong boost. In that fatal evening, our dames planned to have the show of a life time. - Check it out! Pixi, our one-eyed glory, is exterminating the hospital! - Bloody whores! Whores, the lot of you! I'll show you! - Let's have Capra! We want Capra too! Capra! 41 seconds... 1.41... 20 seconds... Dr. Serafim? 2 minutes... Ilie! - What? - The Boema is burning! Excuse me! Dr. Serafim? We've been hurrying up for five million years, and this land's been burning for five million years. Our "Boema"... - Stay here... where are you going? - I'm going to erase "Boema" from our books. If an audit comes, I don't want it on the books. I was sure the fire had started because of Kiki and his photos. "Boema" was burning down. The oleanders were burned to ashes. - Stop crying. The show was just about to be over. I knew Palilula was about to change. - Stop crying. The show must go on! Ilie! The fire department's on fire! Serafim! Serafim, cut it down! You're embarrassing yourself! - What's gotten into you? Doc! - What's with you boy? - Doctor Serafim! - Oh, boss... - Doctor Serafim! Open up! Are you nuts? Serafim! Open the door! Are you nuts? - Is he crazy or drunk? - What do you want? And who are you? - Nothing! I'm tired of chasing him around. Look here. His old man died. Give him this paper, if you want. If not, whatever. I'm out of here. Assholes! - What do we have? - He feels sick. - Why bother calling this clown? It's just because of alcohol... - Welcome to Palilula, doc. - It's alright. We'll get your heart rate. - Come on, doc. You're just kidding us. - What happened to the others? - Nothing. They're all gone. It's all ruined now. Like Pantelica used to say: beware the revenge of the frogs. The big fire came, the oleanders burned down, "Boema" went to hell, and us too. Everything fell apart. Poor Barza! He died drunk near the pound. When he was found next day the flies were mourning him. Then Gogu. Pista caught him by the pillars and cut his throat. They must have fought over something. Pista kept yelling that Gogu ruined his honor. I was on duty then. When they brought Gogu in, he was already dead. Pista brought him in. He was holding him and crying, "God help Gogu! God help Gogu!" It was chaos in Palilula, nobody understood a thing. Why the hell did he kill Gogu? It was pointless, after all those years. Maybe he got used to him black, and now he was white. Bartolomeo had a heart attack. Venena and Separanda cursed him. Dr. Predoleanu died in his sleep. We might say that his dream came true. Nothing is sweeter than to die in your sleep, he used to say. And if not in your sleep, maybe in someone else's. The Hermaphrodite married Nita Leonardo. Then they say she choked to death on a fishbone. Petrica Hard-Days was still alive some years ago, but I don't remember exactly. I know he was a sexton or an undertaker or something... Ringed the church bells, changed the oil in the votive lights, tended to the dead. That was after the dames died. So there were still hard days for him. Virgil Cringasu, Trotsky, is alive and well. Still with his Cupcake. There he is! They're all gone. Nobody is around. - What about Ilie? - Like Pantelica prophesied. That night, after "Boema" burned down, The train ran Ilie over. - Easy on the spirits, doc. We're alone, left here to rot. Poor Pantelica prophesied everything right. Except me. Leana, are you getting that stew already? Sit down in my lap. Pantelica said you'd poison me, too. Goddamn drunkards.
