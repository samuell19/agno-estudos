"Thomas Jerome Newton." - This is not a pawnshop. - I beg your pardon? If I buy this ring now, you can't redeem it later. - Understand? - I understand. $20.00. - $20.00? - Take it or leave it. (♪ Plays jazz) Oliver? Oliver. Oliver, Mr Newton is here. I'm Oliver Farnsworth. Would you like a scotch and water or something, Mr Newton? Oh, a glass of water. - Fine. Would you like a scotch? - Yes, please. Are you all right? Just tired. I'm sorry I didn't have time to see you at my office today, Mr Newton. I had hardly even 10 minutes. (Phone rings) What's this? Some kind of bribe? I'm paying you for your time. As from now, I want at least 10 hours at $1,000 an hour. Mr Newton, this kind of money buys more than 10 hours even of my time. What exactly do you want? I want a lawyer who's well versed in patents. That's me. Here. Electronics. Read the file. (Phone rings) May I keep it overnight? I'm sorry, I can't leave it with you. It's not that I don't trust you. All right, I'll read it. If you want to put a record on, Mr Newton, music doesn't disturb me. Oh, no, thank you. Well, if there's anything you want, just ask. (Clock chimes) (Police sirens) (Buzzing and humming of electronic machines) (Oliver) 'I don't believe it. 'I can't believe it. You have nine basic patents here. 'Nine. 'That's basic patents. Do you know what that means?' (Newton) 'Yes, I think so.' (Oliver) 'Do you really? I wonder.' It means, Mr Newton, that you can take RCA, Eastman Kodak and DuPont, for starters. In, say, three years, what would this be worth to me? I'm a lawyer, not an accountant, Mr Newton. But I'd say it must be something in the area of... $300 million. - Not more? - More? - I need more. - What the hell for? I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to sound like that. It's just I'm trying to adjust my mind to all this. I'll offer you 10% of my net profits, plus 5% of all corporate holdings. I must think about it all. I'll ask Trevor to take you home. I don't drive. Thank you. I have my own driver waiting. All night? If you take this assignment, you'll have complete authority, below me. I don't want to have contact with anyone except you. When you take this position, Mr Farnsworth, you'll be able to replace your antiquated sound equipment and buy some of mine. - Buy it? - At cost, naturally. (Oliver) 'Perhaps you're not so different after all, Mr Newton.' - Arthur, would you please slow down? - We're only doin' 45, Mr Newton. It's making me feel dizzy. Keep to 30, please. My father used to say, "Oliver, when you get a gift horse, "walk up to it, pat it, quiet the animal down, "and then, using both hands, force open its jaws "and have a damned good look in its mouth."

The company that made that self-developing film that I showed you a while ago? They've made this announcement. They're dumping computers. They're installing human beings. - Oh, really? - Want to know why? They want to bring back human error because that's the way you get new ideas, by making mistakes. Back to man and his imagination. If you can't spot a piece of bullshit commercial publicity when you hear it, you're even more naive than I thought. Keep your mind on your job. - That's my advice. - That's your advice to me? You're so fucking smug and ignorant, you don't know what's going on. - Oh, really? - These kids are bored. They're bored with you and these fucking textbooks. They're five years out of date. I mean... What they need is some real stimulus, ideas to pursue. Yes, well, we've had enough of your pursuits. What are you talking about? I'm talking about the things you pursue, Nate. Young things. I don't know, maybe it's your age. You've become a novelty freak, and you're not that young anymore. You don't even get it, do you? I'm younger than most of those kids. They're already middle-aged because that's what they're taught. Well, I want out. - That's the fact. - Face the facts! What the hell else can you do now except teach? Nothing. Not a goddamn thing.

My interest is energy. - Transference of energy. - Oh. - Transference of energy. - Yes. Well, I know it's gonna be very exciting working with you. I've looked forward to meeting you. I've thought about you once or twice. This is some kind of space vehicle, right? Well, what for? Is it a solar probe? I want you to think beyond that. I want to show you this because I value your contribution to my work. Well, I'm not certain what that's to be. Fuel conservation, Dr Bryce. It may be the key to our project. - Ask me. - What? The question you've been wanting to ask ever since we met. Are you Lithuanian? I come from England. Oh, that's not so terrible. Is this a weapon? - A weapon? - It's too small for interplanetary travel. You assume that it's a weapon? - Does that matter to you? - Yeah. If I thought that you were building a weapon, you were employing me to help you, I'd have to quit the project. Don't be so suspicious. I know people think me unnecessarily secretive. If I were you, I'd be secretive. Would you be comfortable in here? I think I'd last about 20 minutes. And then? I'd start screaming. Wouldn't everyone? Last night, I was watching television. I saw these ex-astronauts. Some of them are basket cases now. Television. The strange thing about television is that... it doesn't tell you everything. It shows you everything about life on Earth, but the true mysteries remain. Perhaps it's in the nature of television. Just waves in space. - Do you trust me, Dr Bryce? - I think so. - That's not good enough. - It's the best I can do. Let's put it this way. Uh, I want to. Mr Newton, I'm kind of a cliché. I'm the disillusioned scientist. Like the cynical writer, the alcoholic actor and the spaced-out spaceman. A man like you wouldn't understand a guy like me. I'll try to, Dr Bryce. Well, anyhow, uh...

We seem to have spent so much time on this question. You must understand, World Enterprises sees itself as a loner, a pioneer, if you will. We have that get-up-and-go spirit. Frankly, what you're suggesting sounds like interference. I beg you to reconsider, Mr Farnsworth. The world is ever-changing, like our own solar system, and a corporation the size of yours has a duty to recognise that fact. One must keep up, Mr Farnsworth. The way I see it, Mr Peters, I'm way ahead. It's going to be hard. I'm concerned about the recovery program. Don't be. "Don't be"? Mr Newton, are you crazy?

Not now! (Alarm ringing) Oh, Tommy. Tommy? Tommy! (Knocking) Tommy? Are you all right? Are you all right? Tommy, can you hear me? - Tommy! Let me in! - (Banging) (Catch slides open) (Screams) (Groaning) (Glass smashes) I lifted you up once. You must believe it, Mary-Lou. (Screams) Why? Oh, why? 'Why? Why?' (Mary-Lou) You must hate me. No, I don't. I don't hate anyone. I can't. Your wife's out there somewhere. She's waiting for you, isn't she? And your children, they must miss their dad. What are they like, your children? They're like children. Exactly like children. (Horses galloping) (Gunshot echoes) (Native American war cries) (Gunshot) (Gunshots) Fuck! (Switches off TV) - Hello, Mr Newton. - Hello, Dr Bryce. I'm glad you came. I hoped you would. I realise you've made certain assumptions about me. I can see the flash of an X-ray camera. - It's blinding. - Why'd you come here? Where I come from, there's a terrible drought. We saw pictures of your planet on television. We saw the water. In fact, our word for your planet means "Planet of Water". You watched it all on television? Where exactly do you come from? Well, I'm not an astronomer, but... Somewhere down there. Are you the... the first? The first what? Visitor? There have always been visitors. On my own planet we found evidence of visitors. - You must've seen them here. - No, I don't think so. Well, I've seen them. I've seen their footsteps and their places. I've seen those things. We've all seen them. That's for theorists. - I'm a scientist. - Well, I'm not a scientist. But I know all things begin and end in eternity. What are you gonna do? - You mean, Dr Bryce, what's in my mind? - Yeah. What's in your mind? Don't worry. I don't want to hurt you. (Water dripping) (♪ Classical orchestra playing) Turn that down, will you, Trevor? Would you like a drink? No. I don't like to see you like this. Get out. Now. Leave the company, Oliver. We don't need Newton. I feel sorry for him. Sorry for him? Why? Because he can't help it. (Moaning) Well, you know Mary-Lou's still living in the house. I've seen her a few times. How is she? She knows, doesn't she? Mmm. I trust you both. (Newton) What's the time? (Bryce) It's late, past midnight. (Newton) Is time on my side? (TV Reporter) 'This is a unique moment 'in the history of space exploration. 'Never before has one man planned to travel single-handed to the stars.' (Man #2) 'It isn't a question of one man, Alan. 'It's the head of World Enterprises himself manning the spacecraft. 'This has given rise to speculation about possible repercussions. 'That is to say, if anything should happen to Mr Newton... 'Over to our economics advisor in Washington...' (Mary-Lou) I don't want the money. I want my Tommy. - (Oliver) Here's the cheque, Mary-Lou. - I don't want it. No. No! How do you feel about the progress they're making here? Well, I think it's quite fantastic. It's a breakthrough, a real breakthrough. (Man) There it is. He's coming now toward the gate. He's coming, surrounded by his fellow men, his workers. He seems to be in a jubilant state. (Reporter) 'There's feeling that Mr Newton's experiment is wasteful.' - This is the amount. - No! I don't want it! (Reporter) '...result in any special benefit to the nations of this Earth.' (Clamour of voices) I don't want it! I want Tommy! (Clamour of shouting) - Good luck. I wish I could go with you. - Thank you. Tommy! Oh! (Reporter) '...Farnsworth as to the purpose of Mr Newton's mission. 'All that anyone has yet said about it, 'and that was said by Mr Newton's associate, Dr Nathan Bryce, was...' I want Tommy. I want him. (Shouting and cheering) (Reporter) Are you confident that you'll be a success? (Mary-Lou sobs) (Reporter) '...all seems to heighten the whole enigma of Mr Newton himself. 'This amazing man is not only the owner of World Enterprises, 'but he's also the inventor of its most exceptional products. 'Where he comes from is as mysterious as where he's going...' I've got an hour. Take me back to the house. (Reporter) '...he's the bearer of a British passport.' Thank you, Mary-Lou. (Reporter) 'But from research by my colleagues in the UK, it's unclear...' I want Tommy. Tommy. (Reporter) 'I hesitate to say this is an important moment in our history, 'but it is certainly an extraordinary one. 'There's no parallel to be found with what this man is doing. 'It's difficult to compare him with anyone. He is unique. 'We have all, strangely enough, relied on Mr Newton, who is, after all...' - How many does she take? - Thirty-five. Don't bother. Oh... (Sports radio blaring) Arthur. Arthur, can you hear me? - Arthur! - I haven't got the time now. (Door intercom buzzes) Hello, Mr Farnsworth. Well, I knew it had to come. It had to come, didn't it? What are you doing? What? Don't take my... Those are my eyes! Wait a minute now. Wait! People will know! They'll talk! Let me see you! (Phone rings) Stop a minute! - There you go. - (Oliver) No... more! I won't believe it. - Listen, I haven't got... - Give me his other arm. I haven't got the time. Wait! It's not that different. Won't you let me see your face? (Man) Goddamn it. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. (Sports radio still blaring) I've changed my mind. (Man) There's nothing to worry about. (Oliver) I know who you are! Where are you taking me? (Heartbeat pulsating) Now we're gonna put you guys to bed. Here we go, big guy. Oh. You got a kiss for your dad? Huh? OK. I wonder if we do and say the right things. To the children? No. Everything. (TV) 'He's just been appointed special advisor to the new administration 'on matters of economic development in the chemical industry. 'Professor Canutti, are there any major new developments 'that have taken place recently, Professor?' 'Well, as we all know, a giant corporation...' - Good morning, Mr Newton. - Good morning, Albert. '...ran into financial difficulties. The main reason for this was...' - I feel so tired. - How about a nice, refreshing martini? '...relied on that two-headed monster: innovation. 'The American consumer can assimilate - 'only so many new products...' - Just the way you like it. - Not too cold. - 'And then no more.' There. Now, it's a beautiful day. Oh... (Sighs) Oh, thank you, Arthur. You know, if all of you drank less, we'd get better results. Take my advice, stick to mineral water. Keep your perspective. I'll talk to him. I know he'll be all right. I'm not sure. We've got a serious unemployment problem on our hands. The media are beginning to hint at a... fraud. People need reassuring. And they've got a right to the facts. - I understand, Mr Peters. - I'm not quite sure you understand... ...how all this might affect you. Nate. Help me, Nate. Don't worry, Mr Newton. You're perfectly normal. (Newton) Help me, Nate! (Bryce) I do. That's a fact. That's a fact. It's been such a long time, Nate. Do you really think I look nice? It's really good to get out, you know. Have you seen him? No, I, uh... They're keeping us away from him. 'You have seen Calloway. What are you two doing?' 'Well, they... they asked me to help take him. 'I'm helping.' (♪ Zither music from "The Third Man") - 'Poor Harry.' - "'Poor Harry." "'Poor Harry" wouldn't even lift a finger to help you.' Poor Tommy. We haven't helped him much, have we? I think maybe we have a chance now. They... They might let you, uh, see him. Alone, that is. I don't want him anymore. I don't want to see him, hear him, but he's still a part of me. That's a fact. I don't want to hurt him anymore. Poor Tommy's been hurt enough. I know, but, well, I might be able to arrange for you to talk to him. Maybe you, uh... you can save him. Save him? From what? Good evening, Mr Newton. Would you take off your pyjama jacket, please? How long will I have to stay in this place? I have no idea. It probably depends on why you're here. I'm a surgeon. This is just a little test. Would you drop your trousers, please? I've told you everything. - You're just gonna hurt me again. - This won't hurt. Trust me. Hmm? Nurse. OK, Mr Newton. Point your toes in, please. OK. Take a nice, deep breath now. OK, hold it. - That's fine. - I told you before, I came alone. I came alone. Nobody saw me. Oh, Tommy. My sweet baby. Oh, I never thought I'd see you again. Oh, you look so beautiful to my eyes. Oh! - Do they know? - Know what? About you. How did you get in here? Through the front doors. The double doors? Where are you... Where are you going? (Grunting) You never get sick. What happens to you when you drink? I see things. What things? Bodies. Bodies? Women? - And men. - Men! Men? Mmm! Bad boy! I want it. I've been dreaming of it. Please. Do you know what I think? What? I think... you know too much about me. What do you mean? I can do anything... now, you know. I can kill you. Right here on this bed. Then I could phone room service. And they'd... they'd take your body away, and then I'd have them send up another girl. Oh, Tommy. Tommy. I just want it to be like it was. Me, the two of us. You. You. The way you were. That's the way I am! It's too late, Mary-Lou. I can't trust you. Yes, you can. Yes, you can. - Good-bye, Mary-Lou. - No. - Sleep well! - No! No!

(Ping-pong ball bouncing) (Mary-Lou) You don't want to go back. Not really. You've got everything here. Tell me one thing that you have on your planet... Whoo! ...that we don't have on ours. Come on. Tell me one thing. You don't have any money. You don't have any water. You don't have any grass. You don't have any booze. What do you want to go back to a desert for? If you want desert, we got deserts here. This country's rich. We got everything. All right. I know. Your wife and your family. But by the time you get back, they'll probably be dead. I mean, how long is it gonna take you to get back from here, Tommy? How many years? Light years, or whatever you want to call 'em. How many? All I'm trying to say, Tommy, is that... if you could just prove who you really are, you'd be free! Don't you understand? They don't understand you. They don't believe you. Believe me, they think you're one of us. They think you're a freak or a fake. I know you're not. All you have to do is just prove it to 'em. Let 'em see you as you really are. Listen. Nate could probably make a deal for you. I'll bet you you could probably go back. They'd probably let you go back. I'm sure they would! You could get into that little rocket ship of yours and go back! Huh? No. - What do you mean, no? - No. Come on, Tommy. Show 'em. Prove it to them. Come on. - Prove it. - No, I don't want to. I've proved enough. I've proved everything I'm gonna prove. I've gone as far as I'm going. I don't love you anymore. And I don't love you. You're gonna die like an animal. Just an animal, a stupid creature. I want to give you something. Here you are. It's my last present. It's the only thing that's really mine to give. I don't want it. Why not? It doesn't fit, Tommy. It doesn't fit! It doesn't fit! (Sobbing) Now we're going to take some photographs of you. - That's all right, Nurse. - Very straightforward. The first picture will be a routine photo of your retinas. That's for a simple identification of your blood vessel pattern. And the other is an equally straightforward X-ray. So we can see the ridges on the inside of your occipital... You don't understand. The flash of an X-ray... - (Doctor) This won't hurt at all. - There's no flash with an X-ray. - You can't see an X-ray. - I can. - I can see X-rays. - Here, drink this. I can see something. Are you wearing contact lenses? - I can see something inside there. - Please don't hurt my eyes. Tweezers, please. No, you won't be able to take them out. I've been dealing with lenses for 20 years. It won't hurt. I'll do it. Don't touch my eyes. Give me the tweezers, please. - Hand me the tweezers. - No, I can't let you do it. I can't. Give Mr Newton another drink. Please don't do it. Please. I beg you. - Please don't be excited. - Call Dr Bryce. He knows. - Call him. - I don't know who Dr Bryce is. - I want to go home. - Yes, yes, of course. - I want to go home. - Very soon now. - Finish your drink. - Please don't do it... - All right, Doctor. When you're ready. - Mary-Lou! - I'm ready. - Help me! Don't! No. No! They're stuck. They're stuck. I'll never get them off. (Tannoy) '20, 19, '18, 17, '16, 15, '14, 13, '12, 11...' (Man) Can you imagine the cost? Spaceships! Why do they have to build these things anyway? - Stand by. Five seconds. - It's such a waste when people... - It's such a waste of money. - Destruct! (Bells chiming) (Clock ticking) (More clocks ticking) (Ticking intensifies) (Alarm bells ringing) (Church bells pealing) (♪ Orchestral version of "Silent Night") - I'd like another one, please. - All right. Honey, I'd like to try this. (He chuckles) Oh, I'll get it. - How much, please? - 26.86. Thirty. Change. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. - Uh-huh. One... Two. Want a drink? Mmm. Why not? Three. Four. Oh, shoot! I believe Christmas is less commercial this year. I'd like to go someplace for Christmas where it's real hot. Tropical. I guess I must be feeling the cold. Could I listen to a track off this? Yeah. Let me see. Yeah, sure. Come this way. (Waiter) There you are. Thank you. Mr Newton? - Nathan Bryce. - That's right. May I sit down? Hmm? Go ahead. Strangely enough, I was thinking of you just the other day. How did you find me? Your record. - Hmm? - It took me a while, but I traced you. - Did you like it? - Not much. Oh. Well, I didn't make it for you anyway. Who'd you make it for then? For my wife. She'll get to hear it one day. On the radio. We hear most everything on the radio these days. Do you see anything of Mary-Lou? Not much. I don't want her to get lonely. She must still have enough money. Don't you feel bitter about it, everything? Bitter? No. We'd have probably treated you the same if you'd come to our place. Is there no chance then? Of what? Of course there's a chance. You're the scientist, Dr Bryce. You must know there's always a chance. Do you need money? Let me know if you do, will you? I may not see so well anymore. I still have money. - (Glass falls) - Oh! I think maybe Mr Newton has had enough, don't you? I think maybe he has. Ah... (♪ ARTIE SHAW: "Stardust")
