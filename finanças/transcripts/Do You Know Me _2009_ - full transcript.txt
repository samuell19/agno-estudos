SHE'S IN TROUBLE. I NEED YOUR HELP. I CAN'T HELP YOU. I'M SURE YOU KNOW MORE THAN I DO. THE D.E.A. PUT IT OUT. THE D.E.A.? A GUY CALLED FARBER. AGENT JAKE FARBER? I'M WANTED FOR A MURDER IN SEATTLE. MY BOYFRIEND. CHRIS MAYFIELD. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? I NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND MY SISTER. I CAN'T GO TO THE POLICE. I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN. I CAN'T GET INVOLVED IN THIS. I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST THING THAT-- I'VE BEEN OUT OF YOUR LIFE FOR 19 YEARS, AND AS FAR AS I KNOW, YOU NEVER CAME LOOKING. IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT, FINE. I'VE MET SOME GREAT REPORTERS WHO WOULD TAKE ME IN. MAYBE WHILE I'M WITH THEM, I COULD TELL THEM ALL ABOUT MY AMAZING DAD. OKAY. BUT ONLY ONE NIGHT. AND YOU HAVE TO LAY LOW, STAY OFF THE PRESS'S RADAR. HERE'S MY ADDRESS. I'LL BE THERE IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. I CAN'T GO OUTSIDE. THERE'S A GUY FOLLOWING ME. I'LL CALL DOWN TO OUR DRIVER. MEET HIM IN THE VIP GARAGE. REMEMBER... ONE NIGHT. [♪♪] "I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR COMING THIS EVENING..." WHY NOW? WHO'S PUTTING THEM UP TO THIS? IT'S OKAY, DONALD. IT'S NOTHING. NOTHING IS "NOTHING" TO THEM RIGHT NOW. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK UNDER EVERY ROCK AND TRY TO FIND A WAY TO SCREW ME. DONALD, THEY WON'T FIND ANYTHING. YOU GOING TO TELL ME WHO THAT WAS? SHE AND I, WE, UM-- LAST YEAR, SHE WAS THE "DISTRACTION" I TOLD YOU ABOUT. SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO VOTE THIS YEAR. [EMCEE]: AND NOW, THE MAN WHO THIS GREAT STATE HAS BEEN WAITING FOR... ANYTHING THAT ATTRACTS ATTENTION TO US IS A PROBLEM. I DON'T CARE WHO SHE IS. I WANT HER GONE BY TONIGHT. [EMCEE]: ...DONALD KENTOR! [CROWD APPLAUDING] AHH, VERY SEXY! NICE HAIR. THANKS. IT'S ALL, UH, VERY IMPRESSIVE, HUH? BUT, UH, LIKE MY MOM USED TO SAY, WHERE THERE'S MONEY, THERE'S BLOOD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? LOOK, JOE STARTED HIS CAREER OFF BY SMUGGLING DOPE IN FROM MEXICO. THE PUBLIC'S JUST NOW FINDING OUT ABOUT IT. ALL RIGHT? SO YOU NEED TO COME WITH ME. BECAUSE NOTHING GOOD'S GOING TO COME OUT OF HANGING WITH DADDY. IT'S YOU OR DADDY, AND THE LAST I SAW YOU, YOU WERE GOING TO DUMP ME WITH THE COPS AND I WAS GOING TO SPEND ABOUT A LIFETIME IN JAIL. SO, NO OFFENSE, BUT I THINK JOE IS MY BEST SHOT FOR FINDING ISABEL AT THE MOMENT. DON'T BE STUPID! ALL RIGHT? NOW, HE'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU. ONLY I CAN DO THAT, BUT I NEED YOU TO WORK WITH ME. I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. AND YOU'RE HURTING ME! WELL. [DRIVER]: ARE YOU SOPHIE? EVERYTHING OKAY? JUST... DANDY. YOU'VE GOT TILL TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT?
