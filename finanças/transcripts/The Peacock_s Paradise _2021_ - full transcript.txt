THE PEACOCK'S PARADISE What are you doing? It's cold. There's a warm breeze. I can smell the sea now. Lucia! Can you come for a second? Do you think I'm still a desirable woman? Sorry? Am I not to be pitied? To be thrown away? - Not even worth looking at? - What are you saying? No. You're as beautiful as ever. Grazia! I don't remember where I put Nena's present. Have you seen it? Let me see how it smells. It's good. Good. You finish up here. I'll get dressed. But have your mother help you. Don't do everything alone. He won't hurt you, Grandma. He's nice. You never know. - Hi, Mom. Happy birthday. - I thought he'd be smaller. Thanks for letting us bring him. He doesn't do well alone. - Adelina, how are you? - Happy birthday, Nena. He... He's pretty, right? - Did the trip tire you out? - Oh, no. - I put some music on... - You've grown! She's taller! - Did you say hi to Umberto? - No. Not yet. Give it to Mommy. This is for you. Oh, how nice! We needed some sparkling wine. - Your bags... - It's Franciacorta. - You can put them in the bedroom. - Yes. How is lunch coming along? They brought bubbly. - It's Franciacorta. - Hi, Adelina. Hi. Hi. - Hi, Vito. - Hi, Lucia. - Hi, Alma. - Hi, Lucia. Adelina looks good. Yes, she looks really good. - A bit more salt, Grazia. - We brought pastries too. - Dad! Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - You're not even dressed yet! Hello, beautiful! That's not a fountain, Umberto! Don't disappear now. We need help. You haven't lifted a finger today. This headband makes my ears stick out. What are you saying? It's not true. - It is! - No! - And I always wear it. - It looks great on you. What are you doing over there? - Why are you standing on the sofa? - No, not with your shoes! Down! And Caterina? Shall we tell her right away? I'll tell her when she gets here. What? Her baby tooth! It's fallen out. Show it to Mama! Go on! Show me the window. It's huge! Give it to me. Let's keep this for the little ghost. - No! The little mouse. - The little mouse. Let's put it in here. - And if he doesn't find it? - He'll find it. He always does. What? I lost a tooth. You lost a tooth. How lovely! - The tooth fairy will come now. - No, the little mouse. The little mouse. - You've let your hair grow. - Yes, a little. It gives him a fresh look. - You look more robust. - He cooks for us a lot. Her shoes! This is from us. You didn't have to do that. We wanted to. I made it. How pretty! This wool keeps its shape and is form fitting. And it's your favorite color. As if it were. My favorite color is burgundy. - No! - But it's fine. I knew it, Vito! I told you so. Sorry. There was a card. Yes, I think in your purse. I think here. Look in here. - No. - Maybe in the jacket. Bye. Wait, let's say a proper goodbye. SONIA MAINARDI 34 years old tragically left us I was supposed to get my car on Friday evening, but it was closed. Mechanics! And what's wrong with the car? I don't know. - Thanks for the lift. - Break a leg. For what? For everything. Break a leg to you too! And a long and prosperous life. I'll come up to wish Nena a happy birthday. No. You'd better not. They're not expecting you. Hold on a sec. Joana. Honey, I'll go up and be right back. Manfredi. They don't know we broke up. I haven't told them. Seriously? Yes. Mom thinks you're very busy at work. I like that version of me. Please don't let anything slip. - She picks her clothes. - I found the card. Here, Mom. He always asked what I thought of his clothes. Caterina was more confident. They're like Luisa's shoes. - Luisa? - A friend she skates with. I've been knitting so much, so I might... She skates? Alma! She does so many things. Does she have time to read? - Yes. - Daddy reads to me. The card more or less reads, "Best and sincerest wishes as infinite as heaven, I wish I could express them all." Excuse me. If I don't go, no one will. - Come with Grandma. - Go on. - Grandma, do you like my shoes? - Yes, darling. Who is it? Caterina! - I'll open up right away. Want to open it? - Yes. Hey! Hey. What's up? Mom! - Happy birthday! - Thank you! - You're so elegant! - It's nothing. Thanks. Manfredi! How nice. It's been such a long time. Happy birthday, Nena. Happy birthday. Hi! I've moved into a new store. It's huge. And I have to move all the stuff. - I have to move it all tomorrow. - But you're staying. - You'll make me happy. - Don't insist. - No need to insist. I'd be glad to. - You'll stay? - But I'm empty handed. - You weren't even supposed to come up. - I'll just go turn the car alarm on. - Go on. Okay. What are you thinking? Me? - What are you going to do with... - Do you care? Honey. Honey... Nena, Caterina's mother... she's not well. And... when she saw me she was really happy. She asked me to stay. I don't feel like disappointing her. You know how close we are. - I'm sorry. What does she have? - Well, it's not that... They don't want people she doesn't know at home. Sure. But you can wait here, or go for a drive. - I won't be long. - Don't worry. I'll wait here. We'll go for our walk later. Thanks. Stop it. Do you like it? How do I do that? We buy a guitar. Grandpa will buy you one, then you can be like him. - Hi, Dad. - There you are. Welcome home. Say hello to Aunt Caterina. Hi. - Mom and Dad? - I don't know. Marvelous! Grazia, tell them not to go. I'll be right back. Grazia, sweetheart, how are you? - Hi. - Hi. - So you brought the peacock? - Beautiful, right? - Hi. - Hi. - Are you well? - Yes. - And you? How are you? - I'm good. Thanks for calling so often lately. I was glad to. I wish I had called more but I was having a tough time. And you? How was returning to work? Good. Her last hospital checkup went really well. - Good! - While there I had him checked too. - Yes. - Yes. You know, anyone's heart valves can get damaged. Of course. It's incredible, the heart can just stop. Just like that. Maybe I should quit smoking. Let's tell her about the thing at work. The girl who stood in for me made a real mess. She fell for a customer and whenever he came in she forgot everything else. - And now? - Now they're together. The bar is going well? And you? How's work? Booming, as long as divorces are on the rise. On that note, we have something to tell you. - We're getting married. - Wait! - Wonderful! - We're getting married. Wonderful! - Really? - Yes. - What lovely news. - Yes, we're happy. It's the right moment. - Where? - Here, we think. Yes. We still have to choose the church. I want a good priest, one who cares. One who feels a bit as if it were... almost his own wedding. That's a bit difficult. I have a different spirituality, one that's all my own. Finding a way to talk to him is important. To whom? To God. Find your own way and things just fall into place. We don't know any priests. Dad is an atheist, a Marxist. Mom has a vivid imagination. There's something about church weddings. They always move me. When the bride walks in everything goes silent, as if she's about to say something really important. Yet all she says is... "I do." That's it, but that's enough. To make you happy I'm getting rid of the beard. - No! He looks so good! - I don't know. If he gets rid of it then I'll grow one. Because it gives him character. It's a defining mark. For example, this thing... - Do you see the birthmark? - Yes. When I was little I hated it. Now I wish it was more visible. It's special, unique. Only I have it. In the hospital I dreamt someone stole it. But I'm not the only one with a beard. Anyway I... I'm glad people will see me in a wedding dress after all that fear. Especially my sister Maddalena. - Remember her? - Of course. It's just... we're broke. We haven't told Mom and Dad yet. - We're waiting for everyone to arrive. - My mom gave us a small sum. She keeps the rest for emergencies. I already asked Mom and Dad for money for the bar, so... So you need help. - Less than you think. - A small loan. We always end up talking about money. That's how weddings are. - And we've always paid it back. - All of it. Always. How much? 5,000, including the florist. Obviously, you shouldn't give us a gift. Did you talk before I was born? And could you say everyone's names? There she is, my Cate. Turn around. Look at me. How I'd touch you. I'd touch you all over. There, I'd touch you there. Down there, you'd melt. You know I have a god between my legs. Look at me! Look at this god between my legs. Look at it. Look at it. No! Some animals are meant to live inside. Peacocks aren't meant to. Mom, he lives with us. He goes into the yard sometimes. - Yes. - We have a courtyard. - No, he'll escape for sure. - He likes staying with us. I don't want to be mean, but he makes a mess. Don't you agree? - About the mess? - Yes. Don't you agree you should take the peacock away? Yes. I'll put him on the balcony. Good boy. Good boy. Now he's getting upset. Hold him tight. He did it for the dove. Look, he has lots of space. Right, Vito? Yes, it's for a short time. It's for a short time. She repeats what you say. Is she angry with me now? No, she'll get her mind off it soon. Alma, don't kneel there like that. - Come to Grandma. - She'll get over it. Right, Vito? Incredible. Some things don't interest her at all. Others are like the end of the world and she throws fits. - Right, Vito? - A chair is missing. I got one for Manfredi. Maybe Isabella's? - No, a chair is actually missing. - I can go get one. - No, the chair to the table is missing. - What do you mean the chair to the table? The chair that goes with the table. - We can use another one. - No. If the chair to the table is around, we'll use that. - Where is it? - Nena? It's two o'clock. - Yes, a chair is missing. - The chair for Isabella is missing. Isabella will sit here. The chair to the table is missing. But who is Isabella? What do you mean who is she? Milena's daughter. The daughter of the daughter of Mom's cousin. - You lost me at "daughter." - Nena's right. There are an odd number of chairs. They're always even. Lucia, we need the chair. Lucia? We need the chair. If I get up who'll watch the baby? What baby? What are you saying? Lucia! Why don't you come to the table? Sit down on the chair at the table. Because I don't want to get up right now. What are you saying? Umberto! Umberto! - They heard you across town. - Don't joke. Lucia's not well. What's wrong, Lucia? I'm here. What's come over you? Tell her I don't want to give her the chair, I need it. - Nena, Lucia... - I heard! Let her have it. What's the problem? We'll get another one, Lucia. We'll take this one, okay? Are you tired? Leave her be for today. I... I'll join you later. It's my birthday. Didn't you hear her? She'll join us. Have I done something wrong? I'll stay here. I'm fine here. Yes. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. It was at 1:30. I know. I went for a walk and time flew by. - Isabella. - Isa! - Hi, Caterina. - How nice to see you. Your hair looks so good! Try to get Mom to get up. How old is she? 15, 16? - How long are you staying? - I leave tomorrow. Already? Were you crying? Isabella, sit here. Isabella was crying. - No. - Yes. Hi, Isabella Hi. Welcome. It's nice to see you. - Shall we toast to Mom? - Good idea. - Where is Lucia? - She's very tired. She wanted to rest. She'll join us later. I've never seen Lucia tired ever. There's always a first time. To a joyful day! Here's to you! - To you! - To you. - Where are you off to now? - Hold on! - The wine's good, Umberto. - Really good, Dad. I'm glad. Thank you, darling. Thanks. Did you see the sweater Adelina made for Mom? - Not yet. - It's really pretty. No! Where did you find this? Friends of friends got it... - I couldn't find it for years. - What's it smell of? I wore it all my life. - Let me smell it. - Mom's perfume. Nice! I remember it differently. Leave her be. The first time I drank I was nine. Not in front of the child, Umberto. My mom and I couldn't sleep at night, so we ran into each other. Imagine meeting her in the dead of night. I thought she was a ghost. So, one night, I had a taste of red wine. I was out like a light and I finally slept. Never had trouble sleeping. Out in two seconds. He always slept in the car. He never looked out. Not true, Dad. I saw everything in my way. I stopped sleeping at 15. - You had so many questions at night. - Those two sat on that sofa. - What kind of questions? - Forget it. - I don't remember. - Not one? - When will you return? Where are you going? - Stop it! I always slept in the afternoon. - You still do. - Yes, I still do. I see. You could take a trip for your 50th anniversary! If only. When I hear the rumbling on takeoff it makes me feel like... my chest is opening up here. I wonder what'll happen. You are always an optimist. What? You don't react to anything. 50 years is a long time. No one stays together that long now. Maybe because we're bigger jerks. Who has that courage nowadays? Not that I'd want that, but at least till the end of summer... Are you ready? I... well, we... have something to say. - We're getting married. - Congrats! When? - In the spring. - It's her favorite season. - Do you know mine? - Nena, it's a trap! Autumn. Wrong. Winter. Why winter? Autumn makes me melancholic. Spring is a sweet illusion. Summer is carnal. I waste energy. Winter is more resolute, more present. Nothing beats the countryside in winter. It's miserable. Years ago I asked Nena to move to the country. - You kill even indoor plants! - They die because they're inside. - We considered moving to the country. - Everyone wants that at some point. - It was Lucia who didn't want to come. - Lucia wanted to go. She just adapts to change more slowly. And Grazia had her things here. Right, Grazia? Who will be your witnesses? Well... if Caterina wants to... Sure! I'll have my sister Maddalena and my best friend. - The one who introduced us. - Yes. We were born the same day in the same hospital and our mothers had neighboring rooms. We always joked about being switched at birth. - Where will you marry? - We were thinking here. - So you'll move back? - No, we like Bologna. - The two of them have a life there. - We three. Come again. The last time wasn't much. Sure, I will. Leaving your city isn't really a breaking point. It's more of a transformation. You become different. - How? - Different from yourself. You always wonder if you belong where you're from or where you end up. - You never do... - When I moved here I had one bag. - Just one. Strange. - At first I almost supported you. That's not true! It was a few weeks. I had just become an attorney. Luckily everyone wanted French lessons. I've often considered moving to Paris. - No, don't drink. - Mom! I'm allowed a little. Did you stay for work? - You know... - She doesn't like being alone. You don't like being alone. You don't like doing things alone. Eating alone, it makes you sad. And sleeping, you don't like sleeping alone. Especially when it rains. It's the same for me. Yes, I hate the rain. What's wrong with that? You can't even watch a movie alone. He comments while watching them. Any scene moves you and then you talk for hours. I cry like a fool too. - We have to watch more movies. - Yes. He even cries during Rocky. Rocky is amazing! The end of Rocky 2 is awesome. He wins the fight. He raises the medal and says, "Yo, Adrian, I did it!" She's at home watching and crying and she says, "I love you. I love you." - You're so romantic. - Really romantic! I cried for months. But not watching Rocky? No, I wasn't well at all. I'm sorry. Anyways, people cry. I cry over songs, like today in the car... That's perfect, the right song and just driving away. When I went for my Sunday drives you said I was wasting gasoline. I just drove away. You two just went to the seafront. - You two? - Once in a while, me and Lucia. - Lucia taught me to drive. - Really? Yes, I was 13... Remember the four of us on the motorcycle? Me in front, you driving and Vito between you and Mom. - Mom always got off midway. - It was crazy. - Sure... - And you? Did you see your friends? - No, I ditched them. - What? - I ditched them. - Don't we old people bore you? - Dad! - I just asked. I know what you're doing. You think a girl her age can't be fond of older people? You make a moralistic distinction between young and old. It's more obvious than moralistic. If you want we can discuss it over a drink later. Yes. - But before 9:30. After that she... - What are you saying? Vito, make a toast. Come on. - No, I'm not able to. - Just a few words. - Come on, I'll do it. - Vito, sit down. Sit down, Vito. Everyone. To Vito and Adelina. To your marriage, to your love, which in some way is our certainty. To you! - Congratulations. - To you! Thanks. Alma, are you happy Mom and Dad are getting married? - What's that? - A question. Alma. Will you sing us a song? Alma will sing for us. Go on, honey. - She can't do that. - Yes she can. Go on, stand up. - Maybe you won't like it. - Of course we will! Trust her. Come on, a nice song. Sing! She got it from my mother. She used to sing. She'll sing at our wedding. My sister Maddalena taught me this song. She used to go to demonstrations. Dedicate it to Grandma. Go on. This is for you, Mom. Go on. Go on, honey. A long time ago a servant on a square Prayed to Christ on the Cross And he said to him Christ, my master treats me badly He treats me like a dog on the street He grabs everything with his filthy hand He says not even my life is mine Oh, no... Vito! - What have you done? - He tried to fly. I saw it. But he never could fly. - He's alive. - Yes. Damn it. Will you help me carry him up? - Yes. - Can you help me, darling? Gently. Gently... Careful with his tail. What have you done, Paco? Where did you want to go? This way. Careful. This way... Let's put him here. On the carpet. Gently... How did he fall? Excuse me. Who are you? I'm sorry. He shouldn't have been there. I never thought this could happen. But he's not used to flying. No, he's not used to it. I thought he'd stay on the ground. What do we do, Vito? Call a vet? Yes. Poor animal. - And if he dies? - He'll go to heaven. The peacock fell. I'm sorry. - Hi, Vito. My pleasure. - Joana. - Thanks for helping. - You're welcome. I saw him fall. And then I heard a thud, like a door slamming. - Want some water? - Yes, please. I'll take care of it. His heart is beating. He shouldn't have been outside. - He couldn't stay in the house. - We could've put him in another room. - It shouldn't have happened. - You insisted on bringing him. I thought he'd be with us. Wait, he'll recover. I'll lift him up so he can breathe. Don't touch him. Wait for the vet. - I want to make him comfortable. - Let's wait. I just said... Let's wait. He really wanted to take off. - What time is it? - I don't know. Are they all in there? With the peacock. Lucia's acting strange. She's very tired. She's never been tired. People get tired. It's my fault she's so tired. Nena! It's my fault the peacock fell down. It was an accident. You know I don't believe that. Maybe it will happen to us too. What? To die like that, by accident. This isn't the time, Umberto. Which of us will die first? Ever thought about that? Why do you torment me so? We don't ask each other anything anymore. Maybe there's no need. We live in silence, saying we'll talk later, but we never do. What do you want to know? Who'll die first, me or you? How can I tell you that? What will happen if I die first? What a question! And if Lucia dies first? - Stop it! - Ever thought about her dying? No! How will you remember her? I don't feel like answering you. I'd like to be remembered the way I was at 40, strong, confident, a certainty. And you? Why do you insist? What do you remember about me? Everything you don't remember. My boyfriend taught me that. Do you have a boyfriend? We broke up today. He's older than me. I met him this summer on vacation here. After the summer we kept seeing each other. When he came to Florence I thought, "It's not just a summer fling." But the second time he visited me he met my friend, Veronica. Another girl who knows a lot about relationships said, "Can't you tell he likes Veronica? Didn't you see how he looked at her?" In the end I asked him. "Do you like Veronica?" "Yes, but I like you too." I didn't get how that was possible. It was possible for him, for me it was me or her. So in the end I showed him I was fine with it and slept with another guy. I told him and he got mad. You're right not to talk. So you don't screw up. I came here to talk to him. I told him, "It's her or me." He said, "Her." What's up? Were you getting bored? I wanted a moment's peace. Why did you want to stay, Manfredi? - You didn't tell me to go away. - I tried to. What are you doing? - Are you with someone now? - No. - You should be. - I don't want to be. We shouldn't have been together. We wasted time, years. That's bullshit. What should I have done? Tell me. What should I have done? What is your relationship about? It is about you... coming back... and about you leaving again. I don't have anyone. - I just have sex. - With whom? With whom? People. And how is it? Liberating. And the last one? Two nights ago. What did you do? What you and I do, just harder. The car. What? It's not getting repaired. - It's behind your house. - It wouldn't start. - You wanted to see me today. - No. - Yes. - No. You wanted to see me today. - No, I didn't. - Yes. - No, I never wanted to see you again. - Yes! If you think of me and don't tell me, why think of me? Thanks. I really needed this. How are things here? The vet hasn't come yet. And you? How are you? Have you ever been on a cruise? No. I don't know. I was thinking we could do that. When? We have loads of time. I'm not afraid of getting bored. Are you afraid of getting bored? - Bored of whom? - On the cruise. Living on the seaside, ever considered that? No. The seaside could be nice too. Vito. Ever noticed this little man? No. He's lost. We're so fragile. You'll see, he'll recover. Don't you see him? It'd take a miracle. Miracles don't exist. Maybe you can't recognize them anymore. Maybe he'll make it with his strength. But he doesn't have any. Me neither. I don't have any more. I'm tired. I'm tired. You don't know what it means to be tired. You never ask me. Never. You never worry about whether I'm tired or not. When should I have asked you that? - I don't know. - You never know anything. For two years I've been looking after you, never complaining. For once. You could ask. It's hard to go back to everyday things. I know, but... We're together every day. You could ask every once in a while. "How are you?" How are you? I don't mean now... You don't have to ask, just... just allow me to be tired. That's it. It's incredible how when one falls everything continues to move. Turn around. Come on, look at me! How I'd touch you, I'd touch you all over. Down there, you'd melt. You know I have a god between my legs. Alma, sweetheart, what did you say? Where did you hear that? Alma, what is that? A poem? Say something to her. Yes, I thought it was... beautiful. Beautiful? Yes, beautiful. She thinks it's beautiful. She's a child... Nowadays they say so many things. Why would she come up with that? It can happen. - Dad, that's not from us. - Who taught you that poem? - Where did she hear it? - Where you don't. Don't be shocked. She'll say so many things you don't expect. From some nut... Who knows? Darling, you're still here? Yes. Don't you have a place to go? Why doesn't her father comfort her instead of scolding her? Why don't you do that? Me? Alma. - How are you? - She's sad. Can't you see that? Alma. Are you mad at me? Is this you? Yes. Beautiful. Your family is very tight-knit. Vaguely. I have no brothers or sisters. Just me, my mom and my dad. Neither of them has brothers or sisters. I told Manfredi we'll have at least two children, not one. So Sasha won't be alone. Who's Sasha? Our son. He's due in October. Manfredi wanted to know the sex to picture him better. He thinks he'll be blond. He says a Sasha must be blond. What if he has brown hair? You'd think there's something wrong with him. Sasha, after who? After nobody. Just Sasha. It's not my fault. Vito! Where is Alma? - We're going for a drive. Give me the keys. - Why? - I need them. - Why? - I want to go for a drive with my daughter. - Why now? Can I go for a drive with her or not? - It's not the time to go out. - No, Mom... - Alma, do you want to be with me? - Come on, Adelina. You all keep telling me what to do or not to do. Don't drink, don't get upset, keep calm, don't drive. - No one's telling you anything. - So I'm free to do what I want? - Yes, but it's not the time to get upset. - It never is! I'm sorry, but things happen. You can't do anything about it. You know that, Vito. You wake up thinking it'll be a normal day, then something happens you didn't expect. Even if you've tried hard to imagine it a million times, in the end everything's different. And you realize that up until that moment you were just floating around. You didn't exist. You didn't exist. Can I have the car keys? I just want the car keys. We're going for a drive. If you want to come... Vito, where is Alma's jacket? I put it over there, honey. Should we put him there? - Here, Vito? - Yes. Yes. That's enough, Vito. That's enough. Have a beautiful journey, Paco. Anyone want to say something? I don't think I can do it. I don't know what to say. It could have been us. Alma, what are you thinking? Where are my hands when I don't see them? - Here you go. - Thanks. Mom. How long has it been going on? 40 years, almost. And Dad? I never stopped wanting him by my side. But how did he feel? He said he couldn't be anywhere else. Do you know what I thought the first time I saw Umberto? That it would be impossible to live apart. The two of them have found their balance. And you? Neither of them has ever forced me not to think of the other.
