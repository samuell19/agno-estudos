Jesus Christ. I've seen amputees with better hands than this, I'm out. Good, stay out. I thought you'd come here to play cards. All I seen you do so far is flick cigar ash on the table. Hey Max, you gonna bet some of that money, or just sit there gloating over it? Gonna do it till the account's made. There's a wife and two kids and a coke habit to feed. Okay, big time losers, let's cut to the chase. I'll raise it 50 Gs. Jesus Christ, Max. How come your parents warn you about everything in life except record producers, huh? If your artist can see their advances now, eh Maxie? If they saw the schmucks I was playing cards against they'd give me their expenses too. Well, I'd like to call your bluffing ass but only a moron would try to do that with a lousy pair. Well that leaves me and the weirdo in the white suit. Is it my imagination or are you a wee bit light? Well come on, pal. Shit or get off the pot. Callum? What do you think this is, a wife swapping party? This is the key to my ancestral home in England. It's a house that has given me great pleasure and good fortune. To me of course it is priceless, but to somebody like yourself, it is worth, um, a million. I will see your 50,000 and I will raise you 950,000. You're serious, are you? Okay, Mr. Whoopee. I'm intrigued. Guess we better see these cards of yours. Oh dear, a lonely pair. Not a bad bluff as far as it goes and I like the little performance, but,... ... you need more than a cute line of theatrics if you wanna make a fool out of Max Taylor. Good night, Vienna. That wildcard has been a friend to you all evening, Mr. Taylor. Well, we have a similar sense of humour. Did you dust before you left? You're a funny man, Mr. Taylor, but I've met funnier. And so will you. Buzzard. Hi. Where are you going? Hell and back, man. Aren't we all, love, aren't we all? Well look, I can take you as far as London, buck. I'll make a stop up on the way down, deliver some stuff, is that okay? Cool, you know? Great. You wanna make it quick though. Don't wanna get stuck with the rest of these assholes. Come on, come on, chop chop. Shift your ass. All right, mate, how's it hanging? Excuse me love. Superb. I don't care if she thinks her fans won't like it. She probably does what I bloody well wanted to do and so will she. Get a wick, stick it into spandos and reshoot the video. Oh and Tracy, no more calls, okay? Fuck me, this is wild! Yes, yes! Pucker, what a result. You get about a bit, don't you? Will you walk a little faster, said the whiting to the snail. There's a porpoise close behind us... ... and it's treading on my tail. Didn't do the dusting. Bastard. Dad, why are there cards on the wall? This is a gamesroom, Harry. A room for playing games in. Can we play hide and seek in it? Well I suppose you can give it a whirl. When the wheel of fortune spins, an ancient game of chance begins. But who could know or guess the rules? Adrift upon the ship of fools. Bastard's fixed. Oy, Curly, who's the axe man? Put it down, all right? It's valuable. Is it? What are you doing with it then? It's my brother's okay? All that stuff's his. It's been in storage and just taking it down to his new guff. Well your brother's a very lucky man. Too bloody right, he is. Eh, see that guitar. It used to be mine, right. But I can eat you, I lost it to him in a game of cards. You still play a bit then? Nah, not anymore. I jacked it in shortly afterwards. I got fed up with chasing rainbows and hung up my plates run. What about all the sex, drugs and rock and roll? Aye, I tell you. The way these things usually work out is an awful lot of drugs, very little sex and rock and roll. Too much acid in my case. Oh dear. Yeah. Oh, another time another place, I could have been up there with the greats. As it is, all I got from my travel was piss poor short term memory. And a head full of broken bottles. Ah well, got a laugh, won't you? He loves it, he's having a great time. He's just a baby. If we stay here all night, sooner or later he's gonna get scared and have nightmares. Bollocks. He never gets nightmares. It's just an adventure to him. And as for Jamie, she couldn't give a toss about anything. You're the only one who wants to leave. And anyway, what happens if that tube of a brother of mine turns up and we've all pissed off, eh? Listen, Max. I love our house in L.A. I love our house in Paris. I know this is your home country and you're feeling kind of excited, but I'm telling you,... ... no matter what you say, no matter what you think,... ... this is not our home. So please don't ask me to live in it because I am too rich to be unhappy. Okay, okay. We'll wait till Johnny arrives. Then go find a hotel. That's good. Where are you off to? None of your business! Well don't talk to any strange men, then. This Callum was a friend of Mark's right? No. Mark got Callum from another poker school just to make the numbers up. It was the right idea and a bit desperate, I reckon. Not exactly ideal attributes for a gambler. Just like I say, fortune favours those that don't bloody need it. Funny man. Oy, mommy, daddy. What is it, sweety? Are you having sexual intercourse? Not at the moment. But there's a distinct possibility. How are you doing, sweetheart? Fine thanks, I've been playing with the funny man. Oh well that's great. Take my advice. When you're entertaining late, but we're trying to influence down, nice and early. Wise words. Judy, Judy, where are you? What's it now, Punch? Oh Judy, I'm sorry. I've been a real bastard to you and the baby. I've done terrible things but please forgive me. I've been a fool. Give me another chance. But Judy had heard it all before. She knew that as soon as Punch got drunk again all his promises would count for nothing. And the beatings would continue. So she packed her bags, put the baby in its carry cot and took a taxi all the way to the women's refuge. Well that's probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen in my life. Excuse me, would I be correct in thinking that Mr. Punch is supposed to kill Judy and the baby? I think we just got the PC version. Pure crap. Sex and violence, mate. That's what the public wants. Nope. I live without you. Right. You go full bastard, impress me. Passable. Perfect. Oy, mommy, try and find me. Welcome to the love gallery. Max. Max, get down here! Max! Beyond paradise. You come here often? You get all the birds down here. Two Swedish girls last week. Mind you, I know fuck all about that. But I know what I like. It's not the winning or the losing. It's the taking part. Max, get the kids, there's someone in here! Welcome to the love gallery. No, no, no, no, no, no! Max, Max, Jamie! Welcome to the love... Max! "Welcome to the love gallery." - No! Oh, no! Don't touch me! Max! Oh god. Oh god. I need to wake up. I should wake up, I should wake up. I should wake up... I gotta wake up, I gotta wake up. I gotta wake up, I gotta wake up. Oh, gotta wake up. Gotta wake up. I gotta wake up. I should wake up. Should wake up, should wake up. Cheer up, love. There is some good news. I brought you this. Now that is the way to do it. Come on, jump! I said jump! Jump! Jump! What? Look at the concern. Oh, wicked, man. Hey, moneybags, I'm here. Come on, cough up, you tight... Move, move your ass, now. You can't hide from me! Me know I see you in there somewhere. Me don't know who you be or where you do your soul,... ... but if me catch you, me a tell you boy! Me just kick your evil little ass all the way around the fourth dimension. You are here, messir? Saves ringing the doorbell, then. What? Christ, some set of lungs on that girl, eh? Oh yeah. And she can shout a bit and all. Well, I don't know where my brother's got to but his car's here so he's gotta be skating around here someplace. Oh come on. Give us a hand, get the gear out the van, eh? Excuse me. A job well done, eh? The fuck is he? Oy. Sorry. Cheers. Fag, love? Nobody no move. Because me no one the circle break. Fair enough, do your horoscope. But jacking off in public, I was taking a piss. Can I hear me mind. You don't know everything you know. But you think say you see everything. You thinks the world go around you. But me I tell you boy,... ... it's a whole heap of shit going on round here that you don't even dream about yet. Before all is known, me I get some bad vibes. So move your ass. Gee, this is weird. It's kind of like the seance we had in college with Emily Watson. She was my best friend. Anyway, she was contacted by her dead grandma about getting extra math tuition. And maybe she is in some strange... Enough! Now listen. That burden there is a couple of 10s short of a six pack, comprende? Good. I just wanted... - What I suggest we do,... ... is that we have a quick shifty around for my brother. If we don't find him, we leave a note and we all bugger off, okay? Good. We can't just leave her here. She needs help. She's pharmaceutically challenged. What do you suggest I do? Start my own bloody methadone programme? Now look, you two check the grounds while me and Joan Rivers here check the inside. We'll meet back here in 10 minutes, okay? Come on you. All right. Thank you. Very much. Oh Christ. Where the hell has she got to now? John, a number of years ago I attended a series of lectures at Stanford University and I am convinced that there's some kind of like weird psychic mystery behind all this. Thelma. - Yes John? Shut your gob! Oh Christ. Look, I'm sorry. Thelma, you're obviously a very bright girl, yeah? Why don't you use some of that intelligence to help me? Thelma, your mission is to go down that corridor... ... and to find me one nuclear family and one Jamaican smackhead. Go on now, Thelma. Make your classmates back home proud of you. Uh, crush it, that bloody gagging. Hey oh. Sorted. I'm off for a toss, mate. Oh, you live and learn, don't you? Phew, there's no rest for the bloody wicked. Oh, this is ridiculous. How do you mean? Well it's the middle of the night and it's fucking freezing. I mean who in their right mind would be standing about outside? I mean what am I doing standing about outside? I've got my balls hiding halfway up my ass shivering. And I don't give a flying fart about troubling Wilburry and his stupid fucking family. You're getting really stressed, man. You ought to relax, hmm. You know what you should try? What? Breathing exercises. Breathing exercises? Oh. Why don't you go and kill yourself? Hold on. What's that? I'll tell you what that is, mate. That's a 35 yarder. Straight into the top corner. There's not a goalkeeper alive could save that. Yeah, nice one. Duck feather. I am sure that's a duck. Now that definitely is a duck. Look man, I know where you're coming from but the way I see it, you know,... ... women are more than just,... ... well, mobile orifices. Yeah, but what do you know about it anyway? All I'm saying is that we can't go back to the days of selecting a partner by banging her over a head with a club. Oh, I see. So now you got something against banging women as well. You're not a poof, are you? You're just not interested in communicating, are you? Will you, won't you? Will you, won't you join the dance? Fuck me. Dark out, isn't it? Yeah. Right? Max? Me never like small towns. Come on, little ducky. Come on, quack quack. Quack. There really is nothing to be frightened of. Quack. Darn. Come on. Quack. Come on. Just can't figure it out. I know you're there somewhere. Quack. Duck! - Where? Hello! Mr. Taylor. Mr. Taylor! With any luck, he's having a cape underneath that rubble. Hello? Mr. Taylor? Look, it's a bit dark down there. I was just wondering if I could borrow your lighter... ... 'cause mine's a bit sort of,... ... thing. No. Asshole. These must be the old service tunnels. They're all derelict now though. Hello? Ah, stuff me. Oh, sod. Step on straight away. Club Sexy brings you, girls, girls and more girls. The prettiest chicken in town in a rocks off frenzy. So drag your feet now off the street. And tonight is the night, get into this. It's the Club Sexy psychedelic Wig evening. So don't be square, get balls here. Get down, get on off it. Get down and get it.

Would you like a complimentary lager, sir? Oh yeah, thank you very much. That'll be 17 pounds and 63, new pence please sir. And I'll call it 20 pounds of cash. 20 quid? I thought you said it was complementary. That's just the name of the lager, sir. And there is a five pound service charge, sir. Five pound service charge?

I got my asskicking boots on tonight. 43. 63. 68. 73,... 73 quid. Phew, what can you get for 73 quid these days? A wig and a lager. From the heavens reaching down through time and space towards the ground. The bitten hand of fate unlocks the secrets of Pandora's box. Shut that window! Johnny and Max, the backstreet kids. Great days, eh Maxie? You and me against the world? So much for that. That's life, eh? Maybe I never had the talent. Funny thing is, deep down,... ... I'm proud of you.

I suppose you're gonna piss off down to the pub. Oh no he isn't. Well where is he then? Behind you! Mind yourself too, missus. What the Hell is that! It's a tossing bomb, innit? No! - Oh shit! Bomb everyone, bomb, bomb. Take cover, run for your life. It's not fair! That's not! I tell you what. You can't whack a good bit of family entertainment. No, you can't. Hey, hey. Hello.

You're teasing me. I'm teasing you. You're a naughty boy... ... but I'm naughty too. Get them off! Just too many people. In a big sexy world. Naughty fool, you're not this world. No, no, put them back on again. Imagine baby, make baby with me. Two crazy lovers lost in stars. Seeking everywhere... ... and Mars bars. It's wonderful. To be this way. Two pretty people... ... just out of their minds,... ... lost forever in sexy time. Imagine a monkey, c'mon, baby, let's monkey around. Bloody hell, I feel like I'm dying and gone to Rotherham.

I do, I get the point. - This is the point. Here's a point, yeah. Point taken. Max? Maxwell! April 1975? Dear Max, I'm writing to ask you a favour. Been hearing great things about your brother's band... ... and Johnny in particular. As you know, we're looking for a new lead guitarist at the moment. And I wondered whether John would be interested in joining our band. Could you ask him for us? I know you also represent Ronnie Wood. Ronnie Wood? So John doesn't want the gig. Perhaps we could talk terms about Ronnie. Cheers, mate. Mick Jagger! He never told me. Your own flesh and blood. And you fucking stiffed me! All these years I could have been someone. But you... You... You! You bastard! Bastard! Hella bee! He knows how to make a splash, that lad. He certainly does, Trevor, he certainly does. Boom bye bye. Bloody hell, my knocks! Ooh, you bitch. Flip it off! I will be back! Probably. One two, one two. Oh shit. Flashbacks. Say man, it's your old friend, Dr. Blotter. Remember me? Long time no see. See? What's happening, man? Don't no one tell you nothing? No. You've been called to greatness, man. This is it. The big time. Wow! They're out waiting for you, man. Who? Who's waiting? The angels of grooviness, man. Right. They're all there. Elvis. Elvis? Jimmy. Jimmy? Janis. Bing. Bing? The leaders, the greatest, man. They're all waiting for you. Right. You're gonna take your guitar to a shining star, man. I am? Where the rainbow rivers cry down to you. Where the paper swans glide across marble skies. And the air, oh the air tastes as sweet as honey. I haven't got a fucking clue what I'm on about... ... but it does bring a tear to my eye. Hey. You're not jiving me man, are you? Shit no, man. It's all cool, you know? Who, why? The big D, man. What? Destiny. Everything you should have had you now have! Yeah? Your time has come, Johnny. Has it? Gods are waiting. Yeah. I can see them. It's true. It's really true. Play that funky music, white boy. Get back down here, you little razz! It's like my old dad used to say. They don't like it open. And they don't, you know. They don't. I've arrived! I've been looking for you. Who the fuck are you? My card. Mr. Jesty. Admiral. Professor. Playing cards again, Mr. Chance? You really should try and play with other people. It's much more fun. Is it? Righty keeps it slamming on One FM. Steve Right in the morning Good morning, this is Steve Right. Now 10 years ago, a tragic flying accident took the life of the greatest rock legend ever known. Our all day tribute starts with his number one song from 1976, the Emperor of Rock and Roll himself, Jonathan Taylor. They just don't write them like that anymore. Still. Turned out nice again. It's funny. It's... really funny. Oy you, you in the back? No, third row, you with the hat, aye, yeah. Tell you what. Don't fancy yours much. Face like a bulldog with a bumblebee in its mouth. I'd rather stiff a cactus if you asked me to shag that. On the other hand though. Her over there, oh big tits. Oh, I'd give her a right good tromboning. Anyone here from Leicester? Come on Governor, lend a hand. It's like my old Uncle Ned used to say,... ... never forget the three Fs. Find them, follow them, forget them. He died, '83. A lonely old virgin. I said, I want you and your mates and your mates mates mates mates mates and their big mates outside now! Come on kids, sing along. All right, that'll do for me. You still wanna have a go or what? Will you bloody be told there's no rest for the wicked? Go on, you know all bloody well 'cause I really don't.
