Have you seen my throat lozenges? No. I think it's a shame that Tuva and Saga couldn't come. She can... ...but she doesn't want to. It's the first summer ever that they haven't been down. Where the hell are my throat lozenges?! Won't you answer? I couldn't breathe in there. They'll want to. When did you last talk to Mum? It must be a couple of weeks ago. I think she rang me the same evening as the accident. After the accident. Listen... How are things with Saga? I'm not sure... ...if she realises what's happened. She can be very trying. She's going through a phase where she just doesn't listen. one can wonder where she got that from! It's cold... Let's go inside. I'm coming. Saga! Come on now. And no insects in the car! Get in. Hi! What about these? I don't know what I'll do with them all... ...but I'll get rid of the yellow ones. What are you doing about the house? What house? Hi, sweetheart! Come and have a hug! No yellow ones in here. I don't think Dad has read one of those. Oh, there are so many memories here! Just look at these amazing albums she did. I don't remember anything of this. What should I do with this? What the hell...? I'll go and keep an eye on Saga. FATHER AND MOTHER - No INFORMATION ADOPTION CENTRE How's it going? What is it? You look like you've seen a ghost. No, I just... I understand. Whose doll is this? How do you feel? Are you alright? I can't imagine losing my own parents. That's not it. What did you say? We needn't talk about this. We'll talk about something else. What's that? I was adopted. They weren't my parents. This is really strange. They never said anything? Who this? Do you think this is... ...your real mother? I think so. She's not much like you. Who else would it be? It could be anyone at all. - Nothing in the form? - No. But really... ...after all, Ingrid and Bengt were your parents. This doesn't change anything. Best not to think about it, for now. I don't want you to tell anyone about this. No, of course I won't. But what are you going to do? Did you know that I was adopted? Yes. Why have you never said anything? - I promised not to say anything. - Why? I don't know... I've always thought it was pretty stupid. - Do you know who my parents are? - No, I have no idea. - I had thought of telling you... - Couldn't they have... ...kids of their own? No, it was something we never talked about... ...but I believe Ingrid was ashamed about it. About me? She didn't really show she loved me. - There's no doubt she did! - So why not tell me? I think she thought of telling you, but you know how it is... But for Dad to say nothing...! They did what they thought was best for you. Maud, you should have told me. We'll do this some other time. No, wait! Aren't you going to push the doll's pram? Tuva? Here's Daddy! Where's Mummy? Yes, there's Mummy. Are you happy now? So... let's see now. Before we start, I need to see some ID. It's just a formality. We don't want just anyone getting hold of sensitive information. Thank you. Let's see now. No, there's really not much here. It seems you're from Kolback. Where's that? This is from Social Services in Vasteras, so it'd be somewhere around there. What is it? There's nothing about your parents at all... ...just a note that a Rev. Olof Johanssen had brought the child in. There's not much else. Is there anyone else who might know some more... If the information isn't here, there's no one else who'd have it. But you could talk to this priest and see if he knows anything. - Hi... was everything alright? - Yes, it went really well. She was really chatty... talking about one thing and another. - About Ingrid and Bengt, or...? - A bit. Mostly about her dad. - What have you said to her? - There was nothing I could say. But who is he? That's enough! I have to be off. Are you asleep? What've you done? What? Are we nearly there? Yes, it's not far now. What'll we do there? We'll try and find my parents. Why do that? Because it's... It's important to me to know who I am. Don't you know that? Yes, but... I know who you are. Is it dead? Looks like it was hit by a car. I think it looks nice. Do you? Can we take it home? Come on. Wait! Maybe it'll come back to life. Nope! Hullo? - Hi! - Hi! Tuva Ehrenskiold... I rang about a room. Sure.. And what's your name? Saga I'm Sofia. Welcome! I'll just drop these and come back and show you your room. Wow! Have you seen such a big chandelier? Some one just went... That would have been Maria... my sister. Are you twins... you and Sofia? I'll be in that house if anyone wants to know. Hello, I'm looking for Olof Johanssen. Yes, that's me. I'd like very much to speak with you. - Come in and have a cookie. - I'm fine, thank you. They're home-made. I get them from a parishioner. That's nice. Well... What's it about? I've only just found out that I was adopted... and... According to Social Services... ...you were the one who found me. Good heavens...! ...is that you?! I don't know... Did it happen? Let me see... - It was so long ago... - 26 years now. I'm not sure what I can say... How has it been for you? - Where do you live/ - In Stockholm. I lost my parents in a car accident a few weeks ago. Goodness me... How Terrible! But they... ...never got around to telling me that I was adopted. That was odd. Yes. So I hoped that... ...that you could... What? ...you could tell me who my biological parents were. Oh, I see. No... Unfortunately, I don't have the slightest idea. You have to realise that... ...one day, you just turned up here. There was no indication as to who left you. I see. I found this amongst the adoption papers. Do you know who she is? - No. - I think it's my mum. Your mother... You don't recognise her? No. Have you seen that house before? Well, that could be anywhere. So nobody in the village knew anything about this? No. I was new as the priest then. I understand how this must be a hard time for you. Thanks. Goodbye. But I feel you should put this behind you. Hang on to the memories of your parents, instead. Like to take a walk in the woods for a while? Whatever for? So that maybe we come across a troll. - There's so such thing as trolls. - Are you sure about that? - Stop it! - Listen... Saga! Saga! Saga! Three hours? No, I need them now! Thank you, Sofia. If they can't find me then they can call. - Have you been here long? - About 15 minutes. - Seen anything? - No. - Hi, I'm Marius. - Hi. Tuva. Are you both OK? Yes, I thought she'd fallen in the water. I dropped my skivvy. Anyway, thanks for your help... even though it wasn't needed. - I couldn't call. - You need a blanket. - Before you freeze to death. - That's nice of you, thanks. - I do feel a bit stupid. - No, don't think about it. - Can you manage now? - Yes, we'll be OK. - Do you need a lift to the village? - No, it'll be alright. We'll go back and take a bath, I think. - Alright then. - Thanks for the help. What's her name? Tuva. Classy name. - Hi there! - Hi. What's wrong with Maria? When she was little, she got brain damage when she nearly drowned. I see. - But why doesn't she say anything? - She isn't able to. She can't speak. Gosh! She took my doll. Did she? She shouldn't have done that. It can be dangerous to play near water, you see. Maria... Did you take Saga's doll? You shouldn't have done that.. Did you fix it? You see... she's fixed up nearly all these dolls. This is Olof. What do you want? Tuva is back. I see, so that was her. What'll we do? Nothing. ...and when she's revived... ...she'll be pushed along in a wheelbarrow. Happy Birthday! How's it going?. Have you found out anything? No, the priest didn't know anything. I don't really know what I expect. It's all so idiotic. Why don't you come home then? You can live at my place for a while. Thanks... that's sweet of you. But Tuva... What's the matter? It's all so stupid. What do you mean? I don't even know if today is my birthday. Good morning! Good morning. This is your laundry. What's that? Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. Don't worry. Listen... Show me. Do you recognise her? No, I don't. Hi! What are you doing here? I just thought I'd thank you for yesterday. Marius, are you finished with the tractor? So put it away then! Jesus! So are you still here? I just wanted to return the blanket. Thank you. - Forgive Dad... he's a bit... - That's OK. Where's the little one? Saga. She's back at the guest-house. With Sofia. Sofa's OK. Yes, she's nice. Listen... No, you first. I wanted to show you something. It's a bit hard to see, but... Who is it? I have a feeling it could be my mother. - Do you recognise the house? - No. Those power lines... do you recognize them? That could be at Kragga. Whereabouts is that? I can show you. Now? I'll just get my car. You might want this. Shall I come with you? No, it's alright. Thanks for you help. Will you find your way back? I'll be alright. 30 years since we buried her. Yeah. But you haven't been here since then? Nope. We have to do something, Eskil. She knows nothing. In fact, she does. She has a photo of Ylva. A photo? Yes, I gave it to her dad when he was here. He went around asking a lot of questions. - So you felt guilty? - Yes, haven't you? Don't you feel anything? I've put it all behind me. It's unforgivable. That's your religion talking. I only did what Ylva... ...wanted. Yes, she wanted you... - ... and she got you. - Stop it! We have to do something. I can't go on like this. We shan't do anything. There's nothing you CAN do. Been hunting? No. Where have you been? Did some shopping. What did you and that Stockholm woman do? Nothing. I don't want you seeing her. What? I want you to stay right away from her. - Why is that? - She's not a woman for you. How would you know that? I'm serious. You're not to meet her again. You can't tell me who I can meet or not meet. - Did you hear what I said? - Knock it off! For my sake. Yes, that's a bit of a nuisance, but we can call and fix a time. I'm thinking of keeping the child. That's just not an option. It's not your decision. Tuva, my pet, you're 19 years old. You can barely look after yourself, let alone a child. It's my body, and I'll do what I like with it. Don't be stupid... You don't know what you're saying. Don't just sit there... Explain why she can't keep it! - Tuva... - Don't you want grandchildren either? - That's nothing to do with it... - And where's the father? Tuva, I think your mum is right. You're so young. A child needs both its parents. But I've managed alright with one. Henrik? My name's Tuva... I called earlier regarding the house. - Yes... - Nice to meet you. I have a photo here that... I don't know, but that looks a lot like Grantorp. Getting old is a pain. Yes, the house was on the land that I bought from the church. - From the church? - Yes, that was more than 20 years ago. - Does anyone live there now? - No, nobody's lived there since then. I used to rent it out, but it wasn't popular. A bit isolated. Do you recognise her? No... ...I don't. So you're not still renting it out? The end justifies the means... ...it's often said. But is that really true? Aren't the means... ...to an end, like the seeds of a tree. The means... ...affect the result. Mummy, can I have this? No, put it back. Our Creator gave us all power over the means... Put it back! ...but not over the outcome. As a young priest... ...I came here with the purpose of helping and supporting. But love... ...came too close to me. My purpose... ...became my sin. Truth... - Mummy! - Yes? I want to go home. We'll just be here for a while. - But school's starting... - Please Saga, that's enough! How about helping, instead? I've nothing to do. Hi! Hi! How'd you know I was here? It's a small village. Obviously... Going to stay here? Thought we might. I brought these. I thought it'd be dark... ...in the evening. My darling Olof... ...I can't take it anymore. The truth digs an ever deepening wound in me. I'll be right back. God's voice rests like an eternal shadow over all that I... Tuva! I've rung the police. Did she go to sleep? Yes. You didn't need to stay. I can't sleep. Hi. I'll go. My darling Olof... ...I can't take it anymore. The truth digs an ever deepening wound in me. God's voice rests like an eternal shadow over all that I... It only gets worse, and I feel the seed of evil in me. It has to come to an end. Promise me that you'll help Tuva. Find her a new home, far away. Away from here. Away from me. Give her the gift of innocence... ...and promise me the truth dies with me. My place is here in the woods... ...in the shadow of the fir trees... ...where all there is is silence. - I'm sorry, my pet... - I want to go home. - We'll go home soon. - I want to go home now! - Kalback - Births and Christenings Register What are you doing here? Nothing, I was just... What's with this? You're not allowed here. Get out! Don't you think you've caused enough problems already? It wasn't my fault that he... Do you know why he hanged himself? What do you mean? You've got no idea, eh? No, and I don't know what it's got to do with you, either. Ylva was my daughter. I told her that she shouldn't keep the child. What? Why are you telling me this? It didn't fit into the priest's plans to have a child with a 17-year old. - So you mean that Olof is my...? - Yes. God Almighty! You could say that. So you are my...? That doesn't matter. We don't know each other. And I don't want to get to know you. Can you respect that? - So Marius and I... - Drop it now! We are not your family. Hi, back already? - Hi, pet. - Hi. Are you alright? I think we'll be going home now. What a shame. Might you be back? We'll see. What about Marius? No... nothing can happen there. Do you know who Ylva was? Yes, of course I do. She and Maria used to play together. You remember, don't you, Maria? She was my mother. Yes... you are alike. Saga and Ylva. Do you know why she killed herself? No, I don't. They say she lost her mind, living in the woods with her little girl. But my dear girl, was that you? And it seems Olof was my dad. - Who told you that? - Eskil. He said Olof died because of me. You shouldn't listen to him... He can be a total arsehole! I don't know... he said so, and I couldn't tell anyone. I won't say anything. Don't tell Marius. He knows nothing. I can't comprehend Olof being your dad. Who else could it be? Why have we stopped, Mummy? Who else could it be? The truth dies with me. Wait here. Where's Eskil? Your own daughter! Are you satisfied now? - Am I satisfied?! - You got what you wanted. You're totally fucking sick in the head! Without me, you wouldn't exist. You filthy swine! - I'll go to the police. - And what'll you say? - Wouldn't be anything to brag about. - I don't give a damn! - Think your daughter won't know? - You just stay away from us! You think she'd be happy about that? Dad! What are you doing? Nothing. - Tuva, I... - Let me go! Tuva... Tuva, what the hell is going on? Ask Daddy! Filthy swine! Mummy! I'm bleeding. Just sit still. I didn't do anything... It just started running. It's nose-bleed... I get it all the time. Sorry. It'll be OK. Leave that in and we'll wash out the other one. Mummy, it's stopped. That's good. Go and lie down now.. She's not for you, Marius. What's going on? I don't understand. Can't we talk? Go home, Marius. Saga! Saga! Saga! Hi there! - Where are you off to, then? - Home. Whereabouts is that? Stockholm. That's a fair way away. Do you want a lift? Go on... hop in! - Does your mum know where you are? - No. Are you running away, then? What do you reckon... Shall we go and buy an ice-cream first? Yes. Saga! Hi, this is Tuva. Have you seen Saga? No, I can't find her backpack. - Do you want one of those? - Yes. You can have an ice-cream as well. Let's see... Put it on my account. Come on. I must be the world's worst mother. No way you are. I don't know what to do. We'll find her, I promise. We'll find her. What do you reckon... Shall we go inside? Come, I'll show you something. She's 8. 132 or 133 tall.. She had a green jacket. Tuva, it's Agneta, at the petrol station. Go on in! Do you like reading? Sit here, on the bed. Don't you want to? Whose room is this? There's gratitude for you! Here I am giving you cakes and drinks and toys, and I get nothing in return. - I'm sorry... - What for? I want mummy. Where is she? Tuva...! - How did she get that name...? - Where is she?! Mummy! - Mummy! - Darling, I'm here now! - Stop it now. - Will you open the door?! Calm down! - Let her out! - Put that thing down! - Let her out! - Don't you talk... Coffee's on! They're for the grown-ups... - You've done well! - Home-made rolls. It's so lovely here. - What? - Nothing. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
