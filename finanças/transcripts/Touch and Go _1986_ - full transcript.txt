Yeah! Sir, he's four feet tall. He wasn't alone, he had a couple of friends with him. They were using this. Louis. Look at me. Is it true? Well, it's great. Great to come home to mugging people carrying guns. Look lady, he wasn't actually carrying a gun. That was another guy. But he was the frontman, I guess. Oh, much better. What am I gonna do with you, huh, Louis, tell me? You stay here and listen to me.How can I trust you anymore? Yeah, well, maybe if stayed home instead of running around and... Go to your room. Now you go to your roomand I'll take care of you later. Thanks a lot, asshole. Well... And don't slam the door! I don't know. I mean, what can I do with him? It's just that everything is so crazy. -I don't know what else to to with him, you know. -Wait, wait. Wait a minute. -He's like... -Wait a minute. Lady, lady. Ho! Wait a minute. I'm just the guy who brought the kid home, you know what I'm saying? I'm... I'm sorry, it's just that... Thank you. No problem. Careful with that gun, huh. Oh yeah, don't worry. Good night. Listen, and... Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't offer you some coffee or snack or... Don't worry about it. We ate already. Jesus, you fed him too? Well, it's not a big deal. I was hungry, so we grabbed something to eat. -Good night. -Good night. And, you know... It's not his fault. Really, it's all these creeps he hangs around with. Right. Well, you know, maybe he learned his lesson this time. [CHUCKLES] Uh... Good night. Good night. And, uh... Very nice meeting you. Yeah, you too. [MAN HOWLING] [MAN HOWLING] Damn it! Hey, hey, look at him go. [LAUGHING] [HOWLING] [SIGHS] [FEMALE VOICES ON ANSWERING MACHINE] Hi, Bobby. Guess what. What? We've got something just for you. [MOANING AND KISSING] Gee! How'd they get this number? [EXCLAIMS] Hey, Louis. How you doing? What are you guys doing here? You'll wake my old lady. -So? -Tell her to join the party. She probably already got company. You guys are wasted. Listen, man. What did you tell the hockey player? What? You give him our names, man? I didn't tell him shit. How come he brought you home? -I don't know. -You don't know? You think we're assholes, man? No, man, I don't think -you're an asshole. -Uh-uh! Don't fuck with me, Louis. Don't you never fuck with me, boy. -I'm not... -He brought you home, man. He came upstairs. Then you leave with him... Get your hands off him. Get out. Now. I'm warning you, I already called the cops. That means I got two hours. That means you've got five seconds, buddy. You really scare me, lady. I'm getting chills. [MUFFLED SCREAMS] Louis! Stay here! Just remember both of you, I retaliate. And you can tell that to your hockey player friend too. Sorry, Mom, the guy is nuts. I can't think straight. Don't cry, Ma. We'll be okay. When I saw that hammer, even I was impressed. Yeah? Baby. Louis, listen, I'm... I'm calling cousin Dee Dee in the morning. No! No way! Louis, I'm the parent here, and I don't want an argument. I hate those God damn people and they hate me too! That's too bad, because I'm calling them anyway. Well, you can go ahead and call them, but I won't stay there, you hear? Louis? Louis, come back here! LOUIS: I won't stay there! Oh, good morning, Bobby. Your car has been trashed. BOBBY: Thanks for the good news. Ho! Oh, well, of course, Louis can stay with us. I mean, we'd be happy to have him. -Wouldn't we, Lester? -Always. [CRUNCHING] Well, it will only be for a while. You know, until I can get a few things taken care of. Oh, sure. I understand. It'll be great. You'll be here in time for Courtney's birthday party. Yeah, I'm having a slumber party. All my girlfriends are coming. DEE DEE: Oh, well, no, not all. Just ten. We didn't wanna be too indulgent. But I'm sure you'll have a good time, won't you, Louis? Hmm, I'm sure he will. Of course, we have to follow the rules this time, don't we, Louis? [LESTER CRUNCHING] Ma, don't do this to me, I'll freak, I'm serious. Louis, it's only for a little while, until I find us a safer place to live. -But, Ma, you don't... -Now, don't give me a hard time, Louis. Okay, I mean, it's bad enough. [SIGHS] I'll call you. -[WHISTLE BLOWS] -[MEN SHOUTING] [SHOUTING] [MEN SHOUTING] Okay! -Let's go, Pierre. -Hey! [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [GRUNTS] Take two minutes, get some water, we'll do some shooting. -All right. -All right. Pierre. Pierre. I wanna train Gardner on the line today. But he don't have the red shirt, coach. Then switch with him. Gardner. Change jerseys with Levesque. -[KNOCKS] -Yeah! [TELEPHONE RINGING] Look what Garrity does here. I saw it. What's on your mind, Bobby? I wanna know what's going on with Levesque. -What do you think? -I think you're replacing him with Gardner. See, you didn't need me at all. Jesus! The guy skates in line for six years and you replace him like that. What should I do, drag it out? No. Don't necessarily replace him. Put him on a slower line. He's already slower than the slowest line. Nobody's irreplaceable, Bob, you know that. And Levesque can't cut it anymore. He's costing us. I don't know. You know Jim, he played pretty well in Pittsburgh. Did you check his stats? Six chances to score and he never made one. Look what he did against Montreal. Jesus Christ. I don't know, you know. The guy skated on my line for six years, man. He knows every move I make. Please, spare me the bullshit, will you, please? You, Bobby Barbato, telling me you'd rather keep Levesque than win? Tell me again, I wanna make sure I'm hearing this. Wait, wait, wait. I'll make you a deal. You tell me to keep Levesque, I'll keep Levesque. That's how sure I am, you're full of shit. So, go on. Tell me. Would you rather keep Levesque or win? It's up to you. -I wanna win... -What's that? Can't hear you. I wanna win. That's why you're a great player, Bobby. You're willing to make sacrifices. I'm a great player, 'cause I'm a great player. Hi. Uh, remember me? You know, I'm, uh... -Denise DeLeon. Louis's mother. -Yeah. -You know, the kid you brought home last night. -Right. -You want my wallet? -Hey, I... I'm sorry, no, I just... I came to tell you that after you left those guys that were with Louis when he tried to... -You know, mug you. -Right. Well, uh, they paid us a little midnight visit which I wanted to warn you about. Because the big one saidthat he was going to retaliate. Hey, I don't knowhow real that is, but I just... It's pretty real, they already retaliated on my car. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Well, it's not your fault. Hey, yeah... I feel terrible, what kinda car? It's a Jag. Oh, Jesus. A Jag. -Yeah. -Oh, now I really feel like shit. I mean, I really feel like it's all my fault, -you know. I just... -It's no big deal. What can I do to make up for it? -Nothing. -I just... How about if I take you to dinner? [CHUCKLES] Lady, it was a Jaguar. Where you gonna take me, Europe? Oh okay, I know it's ridiculous. But, you know, at least let me do that. No, no, no. Look, look. -Listen... -Forget about it. Forget it. -I can't. -It's unnecessary. Well, for me, it's necessary. I'm gonna feel much better if you let me do that, you know. -It is necessary. -Hey, listen, listen to me. Listen to me for a second, okay? It's all okay, all right. There are no feelings. Have a good life. [FLUSHING] Look, listen. Regardless of how it looks, Louis is a good kid. I'm sure he is, I'm sure he's a great kid. I know. Mugging is not like a great recommendation, -but... -Hey, lady, look... I'm sure the little tyke has a bright future ahead of himself. Probably open up a little auto parts shop. You know what I'm saying? But I'm under a little pressure here right now. I understand. I understand, but I want you to understand also, that we are good people, honest people. And I always pay my own way and Louis's way, okay. I just don't like to feel obligated. Okay, excuse me. See, I'm constitutionally unable to relieve myself in front of a woman. All right? So, uh, you give me just a little time alone, we'll go grab a burger and we'll call it even. No, no burgers. I wanna take you to a nice place. Okay, you pick the place and we'll go there. Just give me five minutes, all right? No, but, I just can't make it tonight. Okay, what's a good night for it? Ah, Wednesday night? -Wednesday night. See you. -Okay. -Eight o'clock? Fine, great. -Eight o'clock's fine. Oh... I... I... I can't make it on Wednesday night. What night? -Friday night? -Friday night. -Okay. -Good, it'll be fun. -Friday, eight o'clock. -Right. Right. Okay, thank you. Bye. Oh, excuse me. One... One more thing... What? I'm looking forward to Friday. Bye. Should be an interesting date. WAITER: Enjoy your meal. Well, I hope you approve of this place. Oh, yeah. This is nice, very nice. Thank you. WAITER: The wine list. We serve our wines only by the bottle. Thank you. I think we're going to... We're going to order first. Is that okay with you? Great. Not on the menu, of course, is our famous New England lobster. In a three, five, or seven pound size, at only $19.99 a pound. Objectively speaking, I cannot recommend the lobster highly enough. Um... I'm gonna have a salad. And... Just a salad. I'm on a diet. Hmm. Sir? You know, I think I'm just gonna have a salad myself. Ah, wait a minute. Don't worry about the price, okay. I mean it. It's my treat. If you had a Chevette we wouldn't be here, but just order whatever you want, and let's have a good time, okay? Don't even look at the right side of the menu. Okay? Can I have your word on that? Not even looking. All right. I'll tell ya what, gimme the lobster. Three, five or seven pound size, sir? Ah, seven. What the hell, I'm hungry. What's the lobster come with? Nothing. It's a la carte. So why not... [BREATHING HEAVILY] -...live. -Okay. I'll have the asparagus, and, uh... Spinach. Garden peas. And, uh, let's see. Gimme carrots julienned. See what I'm doing here, is I'm trying to surround the lobster. Excellent choice. Excuse me, sir. -Ah, I'm sorry, what was your name? -Emil. Emil? Perfect. Listen, Emil, I changed my mind. I'm gonna have a salad, just like the lady. [SCOFFS] BOBBY: Now, how about some real dinner? Such an animal. Don't worry about it. They got a guy in the back that hoses you down before you get outside. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] So at age seven, you picked up a hockey stick and you were set for life, huh? Actually, age six. -Yeah? So young? -Yeah. Well... Not really that young. Sometimes you just connect with something. Or someone... That you really want. You know what I'm saying? [EXHALES] And uh... Thank you. So what made hockey so right? Don't know. What about you? What about me? What do you do? Freelance personnel. What is that? Temp work? Yeah, similar. -But you know what I want? -What? I want to have my own agency. That's my goal. Because I'm so good with people, and... [CHUCKLES] I've had like an advantage in a way by being invisible. What do you mean invisible? Yeah, you know, when you're a woman and you're unmarried and you have a kid and you don't have any money then... Then you're invisible, because no one sees you. Well, they see your tits, but they don't see you. I gotta tell you. -What? -I see you. Do you? The tits are invisible. [CHUCKLES] -Shut up. -Sure. [LAUGHING] God, you're mean. Oh, thank you. You'll sleep with a laughing girl tonight. [LAUGHING LOUDLY] [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] So, tell me, what is it like being a celebrity? Mostly it's bullshit. Gotta be real selective about who you trust. Yeah, even if you're not famous. The thing is, I never could figure out how do you know who to trust until you trust them first and then find out? First thing you do is... Figure out what you want. Then you figure out who's gonna benefit most from me getting what I want. If they benefit, trust them. Yeah, sounds practical. So, you're happy then? Well, I don't look at it that way. So you're not happy? It's irrelevant. I mean, I didn't set out to be happy. You know, I set out to achieve certain goals. So, I just try to achieve them. Yeah, but, if they don't make you happy... Hey, it's not like, you achieve something and then all of a sudden, boy, I'm happy and I'm running around grinning like a moron. Best thing to do is... Find your own particular arena. Eliminate the chaos. For me it was hockey. What do you do when you're too old for hockey? Well, I mean, not that you're gonna get any older of course. -You know... -I'm sorry. Thank God, because that's notthe kind of thing I wanna hear. What is it that you wanna hear? -Let me tell you. -[GIGGLES] [TRAIN APPROACHING] [HORN BLARING] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] -Louis, where you been? -Around. Your mom's alone in the apartment now, huh?

I feel a lot more optimistic about Louis now knowing he's got someone like you around. Well, that's why I'm here, Lester, spreading out optimism. I hope you can spread some before the Minnesota game on Saturday. [BOTH CHUCKLE] -Yeah. -You guys better be on your toes. Well... Maybe you can give me a pointer or two. Well, I'd say, work on your backhand. You'd say that, really? I think that is probably the most neglected shotin professional hockey. -Yeah. -Isn't it the goalie killer? I mean, look at Ratelle. He made a career out of it. Of course, that was Ratelle. [CHUCKLES] I only mention this because I used to play myself. Wait a minute. You used to play yourself? I used to play hockey -comma myself. -Ah. -Not with yourself. -Not with myself. -On a team. -Gotcha. -See, I was gonna say, if you'replaying with yourself... -[STUTTERING] I... ♪ Fire... Mr. Barbato, we'd be honored if you'd stay for dinner. Uh, no. I'm sorry, I've really got to run now. -Oh, why? So soon? -Yeah, I'm sorry, but I've got some things to do. But, listen, thanks for the party. LESTER: Well, one thing about Denise, she's always good for a party. -Les! -I'm kidding. Uh... I'll... [SOFTLY] I'll call you. Hey, Bob. Hey, where are you going? -GIRL: Yeah. -[LOUIS RETCHING] LESTER: Oh, no. Not on the table. DEE DEE: Come on, darling, not on the rug. Come on. LESTER: Not on the sofa. DENISE: Louis. Sweetie, are you okay? The hell with him. Look at the sofa. Well, I'm sorry, Lester. I'll clean it up, okay? Oh, you're goddamn right you'll clean it up. Not that you ever cleaned up any other mess you ever made -in your life.-Lester, that is not necessary. It is necessary. That's a $3,000 sofa. -Well, it'll come out. -Yeah. Look, I'm not a babysitting service. I'm not the welfare department. The next time you want to go offand have yourself some cheap fling, you can take your kid somewhere else. He will not be welcome here! -Hey, hey, just back off, man. All right? -No, man, I will not back off. You butt out. Look, look, I'll pay for your goddamn sofa. Listen, I'll pay for it myself. Fine. For once, you can take some responsibility for this... This offspring of yours. Just mind your own business. Hey, I'm making it my business. DEE DEE: Come on, girls. It timeto go into the other room now, girls. Come on. BOBBY: There's no reason to insult anybody, is there? [CLOCK DINGS] You go up and open the door, I'll take the wino. DENISE: Okay. Thanks. Just go to sleep. BOBBY: I don't know. DENISE: You don't know? BOBBY: Well, it's just like I, uh... Saw another side of you in there before, with Louis. It was real nice. Well, it only comes out when he's drunk, you know. [CHUCKLES] Have you ever been married, Bobby? No. No way. No. Me neither. -What about the kid's father? You weren't... -That jerk? Are you kidding? I mean, Louis is the only good thing he ever did in his life. Well, that must be pretty tough on you guys. Yeah. At first, I wasn't gonna have him and... Then I'm sitting in the doctor's office, and suddenly I get mad, you know. And, uh, I go... "No... "I'm not throwing this baby away." And I left. I'm proud of that moment... Because it's important to have something real in your life. You know what I mean? Yes. He's real enough, all right. [CHUCKLING] Yeah. He sure is. What? Nothing. Jesus. I got to go. Well, so long. So long. Look, I could kiss you, right? But uh... -We'd get carried away. -Oh, no. You know what I'm saying? Sure. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] So, anyway... You're Bobby Barbato, aren't you? Can I buy you a drink? Yeah. What are you drinking? DENISE: You're going to school,my friend. And afterwards, you're gonna gostraight to where I work and we'll come home together. That's the way it's going to befrom now on, you got that? LOUIS: What? Dream on. You are dreaming, kid. I'm awake. We got rules here now, and I'm gonna enforce them. My mistake was I treated you like an adult. So? I treated you that way, too. Huh. Don't be a smartass with me, okay? [ORGAN PLAYING DISTANTLY] [FUNERAL MUSIC PLAYING] Yes? Whom did you come to see? One of your employees, actually. Denise DeLeon. She's temporary. We prefer not to have our employees socialize during working hours. This is a mortuary, you know. It's really an emergency. Her mother died. -Oh. -Yeah. Pretty convenient timing,though, when you think about it. DENISE: So, how did you find out where I was working? I bribed your boss with a couple of tickets to the Minnesota game. -Yeah? -Yeah. I'm flattered. -[CHUCKLES SOFTLY] -You look nice. Thank you. Listen, Denise... The reason I came here is, uh... I want to make you a proposition. -Yeah? -No, a business proposition. You said you wanted to start your own agency. Well, why don't you let me finance it for you? Why should you do that? I don't know. Call it an investment. So, in, uh... You know, couple of yearsfrom now, I retire from hockey, I don't just sit around doing health spa commercials. What do you say? Nothing. Good luck in Minneapolis. Ah, it... Look, it's a loan for Chrissake. -Don't get insulted. -I don't want any money from you. Wait a minute. Goddamn it. Jesus Christ, Denise. Listen. A person can only give what they're able to give. So? It's fine with me. Just take care of yourself. Oh, goddamn it. Look, man, you know, you know as well as I do you and I -can never be... -What? What? This can never work with us. Oh, now, how do you know that? -How? -Yeah. I think it's pretty obvious. [SCOFFS] Well, yeah, I know it's obvious, sure, but... I'm just curious, you know. I mean... Why wouldn't it work? What, you want a list? Sure. You got one? [CHUCKLES] Let me tell you something. If you want a list, I got it. Okay, great. You give me your list, and then I'll give you mine. Okay? -This is silly. I'm not gonna...-Chicken shit! Oh, wait. All right, you want a list? All right. This is the list. -Okay. -A... You're a mess. Financially, professionally, socially, and emotionally, a mess, because, B, you react from your emotions down here and not up here, where it counts. Which is why you're inconsistent, unreliable, and you're totally unorganized. And C, you got a kid who's probably gonna end up in Cook County prison before he's 12. -And D... -Oh, there's a "D" also? -Yeah, D... -That's good, yeah. -D... -D... D? D, you don't know anything about hockey. [SCOFFS] I know I hate it. Fine, you hate hockey. Great. And E, any or all of the above, none of which am I looking for in a relationship even if I were looking for a relationship, which I'm not. That's my list... -Maybe. -Oh. Pretty good list, you know. [SCOFFS] Yeah. Okay, great. My turn, okay? A, you're the type who thinks that because he's got one thingunder control, he's got everything under control. But it is only because, B, you put it all into hockey so you forget how to deal with the rest of it. C, when you ain't got hockey no more, which won't take long because, you know, jocks get old faster than the rest of us, then you're going to have to deal with it, but you won't know how. And... And... [SIGHS] -God, where was I now? -D. And D, who wants to end up with an out-of-shape ex-jock who knows everything about hockey and nothing about life? And E, which is P.S... It's irrelevant, because I neverasked you for anything anyways. [DOOR OPENS] DENISE: I hope you win your game. [DOOR SLAMS] Well, at least we communicate. MAN 1: Hey, come on, that's an expensive bag. MAN 2: Come on, let's go. DRIVER: Jesus. There's a dead kid in here. -MAN 3: What? -MAN 4: Where? MAN 5: What the heck's going on? Whoa. -MAN 4: We got stowaways again?-MAN 5: What the hell? Kid, what's your name? -Louis. -Louis what? Louis Barbato. Hey, Bobby? Bobby? -Where's the cigars? -MAN 6: Happy Father's Day, Bobby.

BOBBY: Minnesota. Why? I've never seen a hockey game. Jesus, kid. You amaze me. Why? 'Cause I've never seen a hockey game? You know, the world doesn't revolve around hockey. Oh, we're gonna talk about the world. That's great. Okay. Tell me something. What's the world revolve around? You? No. I never had any reason to think that. So, uh... What's the story with you and my mother? BOBBY: What story? You making it with her? Oh, give me a break. I can just tell. Yeah? So, if you can tell... Why ask? Just curious. See if you'd lie. -I ain't lyin'. -You ain't answerin' either. You know, I'll tell you somethin'. Not everything your mother doesis necessarily your business. So long as she doesn't get hurt. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Except maybe you if you don't go back to bed. Come on. You got a long trip ahead of you in the morning.
