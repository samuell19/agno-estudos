Wish I could help. Okay. Thank you. Okay. My sister, she's gone missing, Sophia Campbell. And you're her brother? Yes. And then what's goin' on here? She just got off a plane from Italy. And there was this guy, some married guy. And he was stalking her, and she wanted to stay at my place. I told her that she couldn't. And so she booked an online rental. I went to the house, and I can't find the owner. I can't track him down. And there's somebody else renting there, and they haven't seen my sister. Does she have a drinking problem, or does she do anything stronger, harder? She's a partier, she's 25. That's what they do. There's something not right about that place. I don't know what it is, but there's something not right. Can you come with, why don't we just go there? Relax, you have to file this with the crime officer, who's gonna look into this further, all right. We're gonna do our best to find your sister. We're sorry, you have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer... I'm looking for some kind of device that can detect cameras, like hidden cameras. Do you have anything like that? Yeah, of course. Gimme a second. Frequency detector, straight out of China. It'll detect any wireless camera in short range. Looks like it has red light scanning, too. Can you tell me how this works? Oh, fuck you. Kal, listen, I'm sorry, I need your help. Yeah, what's goin' on, you all right? I'm in a house, it's Sophia, she's missing. Your sister's missing? Yeah. Did she rent the house you're in? Yes. Kal, there are cameras all over this house, little pinhole cameras everywhere, in the smoke alarm, in the bedroom, in the bathroom. I'm in the basement, and I've found a network connecting all these cameras. - It's looking right at me. - Pinhole cameras? Yeah, I think they're watching me right now. Wait, what the fuck? I had to tear the wall down. Somebody did not want this to be found. Send me some pictures. I need to see the setup. Professionals did this. Can you grab the IP address off it? Yeah. All right, turn on the monitor. Is it on? - Yeah. - Hit Command + Enter. You'll see the DOS window pop up. Type in ipconfig. You get it? Just got it. Can you access any files? The home screen says ZIPPER HOLE. ZIPPER HOLE? PROPERTY 003, Online. I got a guy who sells fake IDs on the dark web. Let me talk to him. Okay. Call you soon. Problem? What the fuck did you do? I don't understand, why is he there? Calm down? Listen, I'm your front man, okay. I book the guests, and that's it. What did you do to her? Did you hurt her? Stay low? What the fuck? Am I in danger? Police? Listen, man, you pay me really well, okay. I appreciate that, but I don't wanna know. I don't with know. Shh. Look, man, this took some time. There's a little, small sector of the deep web called the dark web, where a lot of the drug rings, you know, like human trafficking, all takes place on the dark web. You don't wanna be messing with this shit, dude. So what, I mean... Look, I've already called the cops. I mean, I took a peak, and it had some, like, hidden camera shit that, I sent you an email with a link. Install the software, and then click on the link I sent you in the email. You'll see for yourself. Look, man, we've known each other a long time, so. Kal, wait. I really hope you find your sister. I did all I could. This shit's way too sketchy. Oh, no. A lesson on suturing an open wound. Hold the needle holder in the palm of your dominant hand with your index finger extended. This position allows for maximum control and proper angle of entry. You should insert the needle into the skin at a 90-degree angle and take a curvilinear path through the dermis and subcutaneous tissues. By following these principles, you will create sutures that follow a curvilinear path through the tissue and result in inversion of the wound edges. No steadfast rules exist regarding the number of sutures required for a given length of laceration. Instruct the patient to keep the wound dry for 12 to 24 hours. Seek medical attention as soon as possible to have the wound assessed by a medical professional. Fuck. What the hell? Life ruined all. Who are you? I'm John Webster. Sophia's brother. Are you Sophia's brother? I was. Where is he? He's dead. I never touched her. Bullshit. I saw your site, ZIPPER HOLE. I found the cameras, all of 'em. I found your network. You watch people. You take away their privacy. And you show it to perverts. - Did you get off on it? - I'd provide the place, and that's it. That's not it. I'm not involved in this. You watched it, didn't you? No. You watched him put his hands on her throat. You watched her screaming. I didn't want this. How many others? This is over now. No, no, it's not over yet. It's just starting. What do you want? I want her body. I wanna see her. I don't know where she is. Do you watch? You sick fuck. Did you watch all those people? - No. - Yes, you did. No, I didn't watch. Say her name. Say her name, you fucking coward. Bartholomew. She had red hair. I liked her. Where's her body? I don't know. Where is she? I don't know. We're walking out of here, and we're gonna go on a drive. - This is done. - You fucking coward. - You're coming with me. - This is... Get up. Damnit. Come on. I hope this is streaming. This is the , dark website, ZIPPER HOLE. They killed my sister. Subtitles by explosiveskull
