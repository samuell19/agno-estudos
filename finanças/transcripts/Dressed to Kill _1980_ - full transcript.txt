(GASPS) (SCREAMING) MAN OVER RADIO: It's 47 degrees right now at 7:17. Sports news coming up at twenty-five after the hour. Jack Walters will be having that exclusive interview with Billy Martin, and you know that could be fireworks. The best bet for you folks coming in from Jersey, do whatever you got to do to use the Holland rather than the Lincoln Tunnel. The backup there, at the Lincoln, is already a nightmare. Looking forward to some bright blue skies all day today, with sunshine and the highs this afternoon somewhere in the upper 50s. Especially in the city, it could get up near 60. Enjoy it while you can, my friend. Old Man Winter is going to be blowing on your neck any day now. Lows tonight in the upper 30s with frost in some of the usually colder regions upstate. You're listening to Willie Craig on PRM-FM 93. And if your clock radio is set to go off at 7:18, it should be doing that right about now. - Start every day with music on PRM. - (SHOWER RUNNING) This is a cut from the new Pandemonium album, "Lady Stevie." (MACHINE BEEPING) Peter, you're supposed to be ready in half an hour. Ready for what? We're going to the museum today, and then you and Mike and I... Mom, I can't go. I need the rest of the vacation to finish this thing. We made these plans a week ago, remember? I know. But I'm way behind my schedule. I'm sorry. Peter, have you been up all night again? Mom, the City Science Championships are next week. (MACHINE CLICKING) Turn that thing off. Put that down and look at me. (BUZZING) (CLICKING STOPS) We made a little deal, didn't we? You know I'm very proud and excited about your project, but I don't want you working all night on it. I know. I'm sorry. Mom, this is the most incredible thing that I've ever built. I mean, this carries. It carries? Carries what? Binary numbers. It can hold up to a 20-digit figure. Now wait a second. You said it can carry, and it holds, too? Both. It does both. That's the whole point. I mean, there isn't a circuit like this in any of my books. I've invented it. Well, that's great. That's great, Peter. What are you going to call it? I don't know. Well, come on. Everybody knows that when you invent or discover something, you get to name it, like... a napoleon. - A what? - You know, the French pastry. It was named after Napoleon. Napoleon invented pastry? I thought he was a general. Well, you can't fight battles all the time. He baked as a kind of relaxation. Are you OK, Mom? Listen. No more all-nighters, OK? OK. What is this called, anyway? It's a peter, of course. That is, if I ever get it finished. OK, I'll let you skip it this time, but only if you promise not to work all night. OK, I promise. I promise. All right? Grandma's going to be very disappointed. But it's all right. I'll explain that you're working on your peter. (MACHINE BEEPING) (BELL RINGS) (DOOR BUZZING) There's someone at the front door. Yes. Between 11:00 and 12:00, Thursday, right? OK, fine. Bye. Kate, good to see you. Mary is on vacation, so I have to be my own receptionist. How am I doing? I hope you won't keep me waiting today. I want to get to the museum early. I have to be at lunch by 12:30 with Mike and his mother. No waiting, go right in. The doctor will be with you shortly. So, what's happening? My mother's driving me crazy as usual. Did you talk to her? Mm-hm. She's hinting around about surprising me for my birthday. She's going to come up from Florida, is she? That's her surprise. How do you feel about seeing her? Well, I feel... ...I should want to see her. It's been six months since we've been down there, but... she'll just ruin my birthday. And it's my day, not hers. Well, now, think. What are our options? I could make up an excuse and tell her not to come. Mm-hm. No, I can't do that. And let's not forget, it's supposed to be a surprise. Anyway, it's not her. It's just... I don't feel up to it, or her or anything. How are things going with Mike? - Fine. - Good. No, they're not fine. What a dumb word that is. He gave me one of his wham-bang specials this morning, and I'm mad at him. Isn't that right? Shouldn't I be mad? Yeah. Did you tell him? - What? - That you were mad at him. Of course not. I moaned with pleasure at his touch. Isnâ€™t that what every man wants? I don't know. Is it? Don't start that stuff with me. Don't you think you'd feel better if you snapped at Mike instead of me? Think about where your anger is going. I'm sorry. Stop apologizing and tell Mike he makes you mad. Tell him he stinks in bed? Does he? - Yes. - Then tell him. Maybe there's something wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with you. Do you find me attractive? Of course. Would you want to sleep with me? Yes. Then why don't you? Because I love my wife, and sleeping with you isn't worth jeopardizing my marriage. Is it worth it to you to jeopardize yours? I don't know. (WOMAN GIGGLING) WOMAN: Come on, look at the pictures. [MAN] This is so boring. Come on. [WOMAN] Look at the pictures. That's what we came here for. Hi. First time here? [WOMAN] Stop it. Cut it out. GIRL: Mommy. Mommy. Now you stop that. I told you to stand and be still and I meant it. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been so rude. Thank you for picking up... (MOANING) (MOANING) (KATE SCREAMING) (HORN HONKING) (PHONE RINGING) (COMMENTATOR CHATTERING ON TV) Hello? Who is this? (WHISPERING) It's not polite to stare. (GASPS) (KATE SCREAMING) No. No. No. No. (KATE SCREAMING) So you really think Auditron's going up? Well, I got it from a very good source. (KATE SCREAMING) - Double, huh? - You didn't hear it from me. You know what? I'm going to give my broker a little call. - Jesus. - Well, what about...? (MOUTHING WORDS) Oh, my... (WOMAN SCREAMING) No, wait! Help! Please, you don't understand! Please, call the police! Wait! Please, call the police! Call the police! Somebody call the police! (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) Dr. Elliott, this is Lou Freeman. I'm still in Chicago. I won't be back in time for our appointment on Friday. I'll give you a call on Monday, OK? (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) Robert, call George. I'll be home over the weekend. (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) (MAN WHISPERING) This is Bobbi. You won't see me anymore, so I'm going to have a little session with your machine. Doctor, I'm so unhappy. I'm a girl inside this man's body, and you're not helping me to get out. So I got a new shrink. Levy's his name, and he's going to sign the papers so I can get my operation. I borrowed your razor and... Well, you'll read all about it. Some blonde bitch saw me, but I'll get her. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Remember, if he calls you... ...you better tell Levy I'm OK. - Don't make me be a bad girl again. - (PHONE CLICKS) (ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS) WOMAN: Yes, Dr. Elliott, this is Mrs. Peters. I just wanted to confirm our appointment for tomorrow. Two o'clock, right? MAN: This is Detective Marino from the 13th Precinct. One of your patients, Kate Miller, was killed tonight. I wonder if you'd stop down at the precinct and ask for me. I got some questions I think you can help me with. Are you sure? Mm-hm. OK. Positive ID. Hey, Eddie. Listen, I want you to take this over to the lab - and get some pictures made of it. - Yeah. - Keep an eye on her. - Right. - Detective Marino? - OK. - Yeah. - I'm Dr. Elliott. Oh, Doctor. Listen, would you have a seat outside my office in the corner over there. - I'll be right with you. - All right. So give me three copies... Why don't you let go of me, will you? Are you Kate Miller's son? I'm Dr. Elliott, your mother's doctor. Why do you have to be here? I made Mike bring me. He's identifying the... My mom wouldn't be dead if I had gone with her. You shouldn't feel responsible for your mother's death. If you talk about it, I might be able to help. Do you know who killed her? - No. - Then you can't help, can you? Not now maybe. But later, if you want someone to talk to about all this. - Ask your father to call... - No, he's not my father. My father was killed in Vietnam. Take this. You can call me any time. I'm always there all day long. I'm usually there... OK, Doctor, let's talk in here. Call me. MARINO: She was picked up by Lockman at the museum. She spent the afternoon at his place and was chopped up in the elevator on the way out. That girl out there saw the murderer. ELLIOTT: That's terrible. - Do you know who it is? - Some broad. - A woman? - Yeah. Miss Blake didn't get a great look at her face because she had on these big sunglasses. Is there anything I can do to help? Yeah. When you spoke with Mrs. Miller... ...did she say she was going to meet anybody? No. Did she leave your office with anybody? No. What was she seeing you for? Nothing too serious. She had some problems with her marriage, and I was helping her work them out. What kind of problems? Are you married, Detective Marino? - Yeah. - Children? Two sons. When was the last time you had intercourse with your wife? Now what the fuck is it to you? That's exactly how I feel about your questions concerning Mrs. Miller. Hey, look, Doctor, we got a brutally murdered woman here, who passed the point of being embarrassed by anything you might tell me. I guess you're right. I'm sorry, but I'm not used to discussing a patient's case with outsiders. I'm not an outsider. I'm a cop. Now, let's make it easy for you. Was she looking to get killed? - You mean, was she suicidal? - Yeah. - No. - No. So why did she pick up this Lockman character? - He could've been a killer. - But he wasn't. Yeah, but the next guy might have been. You know, if at first you don't succeed. Do you think she wanted to get killed? Don't you? Look. We got some hot-pants broad cruising around for some action. The guy she picked up went down on her in a cab, for Christ's sake. I got a blow-by-blow description from the cabby. After she finishes with him, she comes on to some weirdo in the elevator? Hey. There's all kinds of ways to get killed in this city, if you're looking for it. Well... Yes, she did have a problem about her sexual worth. And this morning she asked me if I was attracted to her. Yeah, but you're not a psycho. You do know something, though, don't you, Doc? Yes, of course. I do some work at Bellevue. Could she have met one of these nuts at your office? I mean, some kind of weirdo she could've turned on that might have followed her? The term we use, Detective Marino, is not "weirdo," but a person suffering from emotional dysfunction and a problem of maladaption. And they never come to my office. Are you sure? How about a new patient? I mean, how do you know how nuts they are until you see them? That's possible, but it's hardly likely... Doctor. You're not protecting one of your patients now, are you? Absolutely not. Well, Doc, you've got to look at it my way. See, we got no leads, except a witness out there who maybe should take a look at all your patients that were around that morning. And that way, I can be absolutely sure that my weirdo isn't your "person suffering from emotional dysfunctions and problems of maladaption." MIKE: Peter, come on, let's go home. MARINO: Excuse me. OK, Doctor. I'm sorry you're not more cooperative, which means that I'm just going to have to waste some time in getting a court order to check out your appointment book. I'm sorry, too. But I feel I must protect the confidentiality of my patients. Of course, we're just two professionals doing our job. It's too bad we can't work together. Come on. Thank you very much for your help. I'll be in touch. WOMAN: Yes, thank you for waiting. This is the answering service. - Would you care to leave a message? - Yes, I would. - This is Dr. Elliott. - How do you spell that? E-L-L-I-O-T-T. What is the message? Would you please say that I would very much like to see her, and could she call me at my office. So, Miss Blake. Are you still living at 93 Nassau Street? That's right. Tell me, how did you happen to be in that building that Mrs. Miller was killed in? I was visiting a friend. And who was that? Well... it's sort of embarrassing. I'd really rather not say. Why? He's married. What kind of building is this? Everybody's getting laid after lunch. I didn't say I was "getting laid," to use your expression. What's the matter? - I'm a little crude for you? - That's right. Look, Miss Blake, let's cut this shit. I got all the dope on you right here. Does this look familiar? Let me see. March 5th. Charge: disorderly conduct, solicitation for the purpose of prostitution. Arresting Officer: Duram. Apprehended at the Park Avenue Hotel. Classy arrest. - Thank you. - Let's face it, you're a whore. A Park Avenue whore, but you're still a whore. Now, who were you fucking? Fuck you. No, fuck you. You're no witness. You're a suspect. What are you talking about? We got a murder weapon with your prints on it. That's bullshit. Why would I want to kill her? You were there with the razor. You tell me. I told you. There was a blonde woman in the elevator... Yeah, except nobody else saw this blonde woman enter or leave the building. You didn't notice if she had wings, did you? She was in the elevator. I saw her. So, what were you doing there? - I had a job. - Who? You want me to get in trouble, don't you? - You are in trouble. - Hey, I didn't kill her. So who were you fucking? Ted, I didn't get his last name. He's from out of town. Well, that's great. Yeah, Ted from out of town. That's almost as good as the blonde from the elevator. It's true. He was standing right behind me. He saw the elevator doors open and that... ...woman inside all cut up and bleeding. I know all about Mrs. Miller. We got her downstairs. But what about this blonde? Did he see her, too? I don't know. Well, look, Miss... Miss Blake. You're going to save me a lot of trouble by finding this Ted from out of town and getting him in town and downtown and in here to sign this statement as to exactly what he saw and when he saw it. How the hell am I supposed to know where he is? Well, if you can't find him, I sure can't. And anyway, you got a lot better motivation than I do: your ass. Now, get the hell out of here. I'm giving you 48 hours. And don't try to blow town. I'll be keeping tabs on you. Norma? Liz. Where the hell have you been? I've been trying to get you all day. Ted was terrific. That's why I'm calling. I'd like to see him again. When's he coming back? Two weeks? That's no good. Do you have a number for him? I'd like to give him a call. What do you mean, your escort service doesn't give out numbers? I want to talk to him. Trouble? No, I'm not in any trouble. I just want to talk to the guy. OK. OK, thanks! Thanks for nothing. BOBBI: You're just never in. I've been out myself, running down that nosy bitch. I found out where she lives, so I'm just going to wait right here until she shows her face. And then I'm going to cut those spying eyes out. What were you calling me about, anyway? It wouldn't be about that murder I read about in the papers. Hell of a way to lose a patient. But you shouldn't try to fuck them, Doc. Hi, Max. It's Liz. Look, I want to buy 60 shares of Auditron. What does it sell for? BOBBI: I'm glad I took care of that cock-teaser. $15.60 a share? You would've done the same thing yourself. - That's $936... Hold it a minute, Max. - (PHONE RINGING) I guess that's why I used your razor. - Hello. - But don't worry about it, Doc. - Hi, Norma. - Just call the police... - I'm sorry about yesterday. - ...lost-and-found department. Yes, I know, I was a bad girl. Remember, if Levy calls... Tonight? - ...tell him I'm OK. - No, I really can't. Norma, hold on just a minute. I'm talking to my mother. - Max, when do you need money? - That's funny. - No, I don't want to sell anything. - Isnâ€™t it? Hold it, Max. Norma, do you think this guy might go for $500? Great. Hold on just a minute. I'm going to say goodbye to my mother. OK, Max, I got the money. I'll have it for you tomorrow. OK. OK. Hi, Norma. Do you think you could put together a coffee break and a hot lunch, for tomorrow? Yeah, I need $1, 000 for my mother's operation. No, it's nothing serious. I'm sure she'll be fine. - Great. Now, what time tonight? - DONAHUE ON TV: It's been three to four years since your surgery. - 8:30. Where? - I want to show a picture, prior to... - OK, anything special? - WOMAN ON TV: Where'd you find that? DONAHUE: Actually we stole it from People magazine, which has an article. Thank God straight fucks are still in style. This is Nancy Hart, the transsexual. - Just in from Cleveland. - Isnâ€™t that something? - I'll be there. - You were a war correspondent? Among other things. And a foreign correspondent in the Middle East. And... ...I did a lot of police reporting, and I dove on Spanish treasure wrecks. DONAHUE: You did a lot of macho things, then? This is very common among transsexuals. You find... When I speak of transsexuals, I tend to speak of male to female because there are a whole lot of more of them than going the other way. And an awful lot of them have real macho backgrounds. I know a police captain, a West Pointer, a couple of fighter pilots. They all, you know, most of them tried real hard. You were married twice? You are also the father of three children. So, you enjoyed a... I don't want to say normal, I guess that's a prejudicial way to put it, but you enjoyed the traditional role of father. You fathered three children, and you have engaged in at least two heterosexual relationships. More than that. I've always been a devout heterosexual. Cleveland? Excuse me? Room 331, you're the guy from Cleveland, right? Three-thirty-one. I'm from Cleveland. Well, hi. I'm Liz from the escort service. You're kidding? - It's me. - Well, hi. Yeah, I'm glad to meet you. Well, are you going to pump me dry here or invite me in? I'm sorry, come in. You know, could I get you anything...? 93 Nassau Street. Well, come on, let's go. (TIRES SCREECHING) Look, forget that address I just gave you. Drop me at Columbus Circle. Could you help me out? Someone's following me. This is Dr. Elliott again. Did Bobbi pick up my messages yet? - WOMAN: Yes, she has. - She did? - Yes, she did. - When? I'm sorry. I wouldn't know. Could you give her another message, please? - Yes. Go ahead. - Yeah. It is urgent that I see her. I will be in my office all tonight and after 5:00 tomorrow. What's the going rate on running lights? (CAR HORN HONKING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) Did I lose her? You're doing swell, just swell. But she's still coming. Look, I didn't deliver, so why don't you let me take you to dinner instead? - All right, you got a date. - OK. - Look, I gotta go. - OK. Listen, I'll give you a call. Yeah, call me. Excuse me. (TIRES SCREECHING) - (HORN HONKING) - Get out of the way! It's a free country! He nearly clipped me! (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON BOOMBOX) Keeps pushing me. Do you know her? Hey, lady, what you looking for? A train. They still stop here, don't they? Yeah, they stop here. They stop down there, too. Am I bothering you? - No, you ain't bothering me. - Good. But you're bothering me. She's bothering you, Sonny? Yeah, that's right, this bitch is bothering me. - What are you going to do about it? - I'm going to break her fucking ass. MAN: Hey, why break it when we can fuck it first? Hey, lady, where you going? I don't want to crowd you guys. Why are you down here if you didn't want to crowd us? Give me a break. Hey, man, don't let her get away! Get after her! Come on, man. Come on, catch her, man. Shit! Get out of the way! Take it easy, lady, this ain't the rush hour. Where the fuck are you guys when somebody needs you? I was almost attacked. - When? - Right here, now, by those punks. I don't see nothing. Well, they were right here. I thought you said you were attacked... There are, but there's this blonde that's been following... Oh, forget it. (SHOUTING) (SCREAMING) Let's get the fuck out of here! The blonde must be one of Elliott's patients. I was unloading my camera when I saw her come out of his office and I followed her to you. What was that stuff you sprayed on her? It's a kind of Mace I made at home. It's a pretty simple compound of sodium... Save the Mr. Wizard lecture, I wouldn't know sodium from Adam. It sure worked. It's temporary blindness. It only lasts about ten seconds. Saved my life. I know. I wish I had saved Mom's. You liked your mom a lot, didn't you? Yeah. I miss her. You want some more Coke? Yeah. Yeah, thank you. How do you like my painting? It's... very nice. I bought it a couple of years ago for $500. It's really a great investment. I mean, ten years from now, it could be worth... a million dollars. More if the artist dies, of course. - Good luck with it. - Thanks. Doesn't your father wonder where you are? He's not my father. He's my stepfather. I told him I am staying at my friend Paul's, and he'll cover for me. I'll take you home tomorrow. I don't want to go home. Miss Blake, I've got some pictures... Call me Liz, OK? Liz, I've got some pictures of that blonde from a camera I hid outside Elliott's office. Now, we gotta get in, get Elliott's appointment book, and get her name. That's what the police are for. Come on, let's talk to Marino. Fine, you talk to Marino. I'm going to find out the blonde's name. Who do you think you are, Superman? You're just a kid, for God's sake. Yeah, I'm the kid that saved your life. All right, look, let me talk to Marino. If he cops out, then I'll help you. OK, but you can't mention my name. Mike would kill me. I'm supposed to be... studying for a French exam. Well, your friend's covering for you tonight, right? Well, I'm your friend, too, and I'll be the best cover you ever had. OK. You sure you going to be OK here? Fine. Well... Here you go. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, Marino, I gotta talk to you. - Mr. Out-of-Town turn up? - No. Then you better send for your overnight bags. Hey, come on, you know I didn't kill that woman. You're still my best bet. For your information, she tried to kill me last night. Really? Is that supposed to be concern in your voice? I take a professional interest in our citizens knocking each other off. Where did this happen? She followed me from the Sheraton into the subway. I thought I lost her, but she was waiting when I got home. - She tried to slash me. - Any witnesses to this one? - Yes. - Who? - I can't tell you. - Out of town again? No, I just promised I wouldn't say anything. You know, this has a familiar ring to it. Look, Marino, I'm not interested in your wiseass remarks. Someone's trying to kill me, and I need help. I'll help you. I got a nice cell. You'll be very safe in it. Hey, Eddie. Hey, wait a minute. Look. I know the murderer is one of Elliott's patients. - How do you know that? - Because she came out of his office. Did you see her? Well, no, not exactly. But I know she came out. You got to get in there, get his appointment book. Her name's got to be in it. I hope you make a better hooker than you do a detective. I thought about Elliott's appointment book a long time ago. - So? - So... You canâ€™t just walk into some shrink's joint and start going through his books. You need a search warrant. And judges take a long time before they let you start snooping around some shrink's office. Of course, that wouldn't prevent a paranoid murder suspect from breaking in. You know, searching for some evidence to defend her case. Oh, I get it. You want me to break in for you. I don't want you to do anything illegal. You can quote me on that. But I'm booking you tomorrow. You got it? Tomorrow. I'm Dr. Levy. How do you do? I'm Dr. Elliott. What can I do for you, Dr. Elliott? You're seeing a patient of mine. That's right. I believe she's dangerous. Really? In what way? She's causing me trouble because I wouldn't approve her sex-change operation. What kind of trouble has she caused you? She's threatened me several times over the phone. - She also stole my razor. - Why would she do that? Doctor, did you read about the woman who was slashed to death in an elevator? It was on the front page, I could hardly miss... Kate Miller, the victim, was my patient. You don't think that Bobbi had anything to do with that? My razor's gone. Kate Miller was killed with a razor. Nobody else could have taken it? Doctor, I am not paranoid. Bobbi has threatened me over the phone. She said she was going to hurt me. My patient was slashed to death, and my razor's gone. Now you don't have to be a detective to figure it out, do you? Come with me, and... we'll talk to the police. I've already been to the police. But I didn't tell them about Bobbi. I wanted to talk to her first. I wanted to be absolutely sure that it was her. But she wouldn't return my calls. I was hoping you'd be able to help. Yes, I'll help. I'll talk to her. If I agree with your diagnosis, we'll go to the police. Thank you. Please let me know what happens. Do you know why Bobbi came to see me in the first place? No. Why don't we go to my office, and we'll try to get in touch with her. I am late for an appointment now. Why don't you call me at my office when you've reached her. All right. You sure you'll be at your office? Yes, I'm sure. I'll call you there. Peter Miller, I left some Super-8 film. There's four dollars there. PETER: I timed Elliott's patients coming out of his office, and the fastest was eight seconds. So I set my camera to go off every four seconds so I'd be sure to get a good shot of everybody. - That's her. - LIZ: She must be his last appointment. We got to get a look in that book. Yeah, I know. Marino wants it, too. Only, I can get it for him faster. No legal red tape, just my ass. Look, I'll get it, nobody cares about my ass. I'm just a grief-struck kid. Yeah, but what a kid. Okay, I got an idea. It was very nice of you to see... It was nice of you to see me so soon. I try to keep my nights open for returning phone calls or in case a patient needs some extra help. I was worried about you. You've had a terrible experience. I know. I didn't realize... But I've been having these terrible nightmares. What were they about? Well... I have to get a cigarette. I'm in this house that I've never been to before, visiting a friend. He's not there. I'm watching TV... and the doorbell rings. It's a man. He's big, dark. He says his car broke down, and he needs to use the phone. I believe him and let him in... ...although I know something's wrong. He closes the door, locks it, and takes out a razor. He says he's not going to hurt me. Then he tells me... what he's going to do to me... ...and how much I'm going to like it. All the time he's talking, I can see the bulge in his pants. He orders me to strip. I do it, keeping one eye on the razor. He drops his pants... ...forces me down, on my stomach. He spreads my legs, kneels down behind me... ...and rests the cold blade. Forcing it. I'm sorry. What's the matter? It's just so dirty. Why do you say that? Look, I know what dirty is, and this is dirty. Well, why don't you just talk about it? I'm sure it's not as bad as you think. It's very bad. And you're talking to an expert on bad. Oh, really? Now what makes you such an expert? Because I'm a hooker. Ah. And I have done most of the bad things you just read about. Do you like doing these things? - Sometimes. - What do you like about it? I like to turn men on. I must do a pretty good job because they pay me a lot. Do you ever have any sex that's not paid for? Is that a proposal? No. It... It's what we psychiatrists call a question. Yes. "Yes" what? Yes, I do. For men that turn me on. What sort of men turn you on? Mature, doctorly type. Like you. Are you sexually attracted to me? Yes. Are you? - Attracted to you? - Mm-hm. Yes. But then, this isn't a social visit, is it? You've come here for help and my job is to offer you emotional assistance. How about some sexual assistance? Do you want to fuck me? - Oh, yes. - Well, why don't you? - Because I'm a doctor and... - Fucked a lot of doctors. - And I'm married. - Fucked a lot of them, too. Don't you think we're getting off the point? Do you mind if I take off my coat? No. (PANTS) And the rest, too? Now, why would you want to do a thing like that? Well, because of the size of that cock in your pants. I don't think you're so married. Well? What do you think? I think you're a very attractive woman. Would you like to touch me? Yes and no. Yes, because I'm... Well, why don't you? I told you why. That's right. You're a married doctor. I remember now. - I think you're full of shit. - You do? Just because I happen to have personal and professional ethics? Look, Doc, I think you're kind of shy. So... I'm going to go powder my nose and when I come back, I hope to find your clothes right next to mine. And if not, we can just get back to the mind-fuck. (GRUNTS) Dr. Elliott? Dr. Elliott? Dr. Elliott? You really are shy, aren't you? - Liz! - (BANGING) (PETER SHOUTING) Behind you, Liz! (GUNSHOT) (SOBBING) So you had me followed? That's right. You've met Betty Luce, one of our best young police... persons. When I told you I was attacked on the subway, you thought I was nuts. Well, Detective Luce told me she lost you at Columbus Circle. I didn't figure there was another blonde following you. I mean, who would? Yeah, and you wrote me off as a girl with an overactive imagination. Yeah, something like that. - And she followed me to Elliott's. - That's right. Thank God. What's wrong with that guy, anyway? - He was a transsexual. - What? A transsexual. About to make the final step, but his male side couldn't let him do it. MARINO: Male side? There was Dr. Elliott, and there was Bobbi. Bobbi came to me to get psychiatric approval for a sex-reassignment operation. I thought he was unstable, and Elliott confirmed my diagnosis. Opposite sexes inhabiting the same body. The sex-change operation was to resolve the conflict. But as much as Bobbi tried to get it, Elliott blocked it. So Bobbi got even. MARINO: By killing Mrs. Miller. Yes, she aroused Elliott, just as you did, Miss Blake. You mean, when Elliott got turned on, Bobbi took over? Yes. It was like Bobbi's red alert. Elliott's penis became erect and Bobbi took control, trying to kill anyone that made Elliott masculinely sexual. When Elliott came to my office, it was the first time I saw Bobbi's masculine self. When he told me that he thought Bobbi had killed Mrs. Miller, he was confessing himself. I immediately called Detective Marino. So why the hell didn't you stop me from going to Elliott's? Why? Because I was at a football game with my kids, that's why. By the time I spoke with Dr. Levy, you were already over there. So you never really thought I killed Mrs. Miller? No. But I had to get into Elliott's office to find out which weirdo did, so I pressed you into service. Are you kidding? So I had Miss Luce there tailing you to make sure you didn't get into too much trouble. Thanks. Well, it's always wonderful to be of some assistance to the police. Are you kidding? So what's going to happen to Elliott? Well? There's some men and women who think they're born in the wrong body. They're called transsexuals. And all they want to do is have their sex changed. How do you do that? Well, if you're a man that wants to become a woman, you take female hormones. What do they do? Well, your skin softens, you grow breasts, and you don't get hard anymore. Great. You sure you want to know about this? Yeah. It's giving me some wonderful new ideas for a science project. Instead of building a computer, I could build a woman... out of me. Great idea. In that case, I'll give you all the details. The next step is surgery. Let me see if I can remember the exact word that Levy told me. Oh, yeah, a penectomy. What's that? You know, when they take your penis and slice it down the middle. Yeah, that's what I thought it was. Then... ...castration... ...plastic reconstruction and the formation of an artificial vagina. A vaginoplasty, to those in the know. And I thought Elliott just put on a dress. He did. And a wig, too. But you see, that's no good in bed, when you gotta take everything off. What's going to happen to him now? Well, first he has to recover from the gun wound, and then if he's ever sane enough to get out of Bellevue, they'll try him. And guess who's the star witness. You. Right. Something I'm really looking forward to. Well, I think I'm going to stick to my computer. That sounds like a very good idea. Look, Liz... I gotta get home and get to work. I'm going to miss having you on my tail. It made me feel kind of safe. Look, you want to come home with me? I'd love the company. Wouldn't Mike mind? Well, Mike's out of town on a business trip. We got plenty of room. Great. I could sure use the vacation. Good. I'll get the check.
