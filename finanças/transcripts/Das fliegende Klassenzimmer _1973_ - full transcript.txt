Ten years ago, a little boy flew across the ocean all on his own. His name was Johnny Trotz. His grandmother was supposed to pick him up at the Munich airport. Can I have some more ice cream, please? The third one! Won't you feel sick afterwards? Ice cream doesn't make me feel sick. Only spinach does. Why is it forbidden? - You speak German! - Yes, because of my mom. But she's in New York. - And your dad? - He's gone. We don't know where he is. - So you're flying all on your own? - Yes, Mom has to earn some money first. Come over here. Now you'll be the captain and fly the plane. Now take the yoke. And steer straight ahead, so we'll be in Munich on time. Let's have a look over there, Johnny. What a pity! Come on. - Excuse me, are you Mrs. Trotz? - No, I'm sorry. Maybe your grandma doesn't know when the plane arrives. Wait a second. No, I'm sorry. The grandmother of Johnny Trotz who has just arrived from New York is requested to come to the Lufthansa counter. But she couldn't pick up her grandson, as she had just had an accident. Our office is trying to call her. Would you be willing to take the boy with you for one day if needed? Of course. What are you doing here, Johnny? I'll stay with you. - But what does your grandma say about that? - She's gone. - And your mother? - She stayed in New York. - Later on she married again. - So you've been all alone since then? Not really. That's him: Otto Carstens. He's flying a Jumbo jet now. - And you, right? - Yes. I was four at that time. And that's in Aunt Ina's garden. She's his sister. I grew up with her. - Because Otto is travelling all the time. - Of course, as a pilot... That was during the Easter holidays. We were in Cairo. Last year, my parents were in Egypt as well. But without me. They never take me along when they travel. I think they don't want me anymore. - Don't talk rubbish, Uli. - But why did they send me to a boarding school then? Could you be quiet, please? Or else I'll show you... They sent me away, even though they know I'm always scared. Do you have bats in the belfry, you idiots? What are you doing, you morons? That's the boarding school where Johnny, Uli and all the others live and study. They are called the "internals" in contrast to the so-called "externals" Externals don't live in the school, but with their parents instead. "Internals" like Johnny spend almost all their time at the boarding school. They leave for their homes only for the holidays Johnny, turn on the radio. That's the prefect Laban, also called "Handsome Theodor". He's currently supervising the younger pupils. That's mean. I was having a really nice dream. - What about? - About apple strudel. - At least one meter long. - Get up or you'll miss breakfast. That would be a disaster indeed. What's going on? I'm sick. I have a sore throat. I rather think it's "truancia". But stay in bed. I'm going to call Nurse Beate. Being sick is not an option with her. Already done washing yourself? I bet you just spat in the air and ran through it. - Stop bragging, Laban! - Mind your own business. Handsome Theodor is acting up like a bunch of nude schoolmasters again. So, we'll take off the pajamas and test whether water is wet. It is wet! I'm so sorry. My finger got stuck in the tap. Watch it! I must say that you are seriously... healthy. There are two therapies. Either I paint your throat with iodine, or you get up. Which do you want? - To get up. - Go on, then! Do you want to lean on me, so you won't get dizzy? - Thanks, I'm alright. - Good morning. - Good morning, Principal. - Wake up. Wake up. - But I'm awake already. - I'm meant the homonymous song and not you. - I see. Pitch! No, no. Only Thaler. Too high. Too deep. I'm sorry, Principal. Three, four... No one knows who came up with the nickname "Justus" for Dr. Johannes Bökh. Justus means "the just one". And Dr. Bökh really is a just man. That's why he is the favorite teacher of our friends. ... the North Pole gets a third as much solar radiation as the equator. But those sun rays have already lost a lot of their heat when they reach the surface. Why is that? Martin! Because those sun rays have to travel a longer distance through the atmosphere. Correct. Very good. And that's why there is a zone of eternal ice up here. Are there any ships up there? - I mean on those seas. - Of course there are ships up there. But you have to navigate very carefully because of the icebergs that... What do we know about icebergs? Of the four quarters of the height of an iceberg... three thirds to two thirds are underwater. One third is in the air. Well, four quarters of four thirds... That's higher mathematics. Too difficult for me. I just can't imagine this. I can only imagine things I have already seen. Like roast pork, for example. But Matthias is right. Of course it would we be great if I could show you all the things I'm telling you about. - It would be better than on TV, right? - Or on the stage. Just imagine we would really visit the Eskimos or go to Africa. - It was great how Justus came to Matz's defense. - Justus, the just one. - If only all teachers were like him. - There are other good teachers. Like my old man. - I don't like Professor Kreuzkamm. - Why? Because we're going to have a dictation exam now and I'm going to fail again. - Just copy from Sebastian. - Your old man always makes me sit on my own. On the 18th of October... the New Zealand... Well, upper or lower case? ... the New Zealand Himalaya expedition arrived in the city of Kathmandu... where they... bought some supplies. Full stop. You take the notebooks home. Tell your mom I'll be late today because of a meeting. Yes, Dad. Teachers' party! - Kreuzkamm? - Professor? - Move. Pork belly with lentils? Maybe I'll be able to eat my fill tomorrow. - Are you still hungry? - Yes, but I don't have any money. And Scherf Bakery is selling fresh crullers today... I'll loan you one mark. But don't let them catch you when you leave. - Handsome Theodor is on duty today. - I don't care about him. Thanks. At two o'clock we'll be rehearsing. Johnny has written some new lines. - So, what about tonight? - Probably. - The movies? - But not too late. - 18:30? - We can go for a drink afterwards. - At the "Crazy Dog"? Great! Are you going to whistle? - You? - Yes... - Nothing. - I see. The North Pole and where the palm trees grow, ... it would be great to see it with our own eyes. Let them arrange the goal. Stay back. You would have to be there as well, of course. Stay back. Come on, get in the water. Lift up the front. You have to lift it up. Lift it up. Rascals! Class will be an on-site inspection. Class will be an on-site inspection. There you are. - How is it going? - It still needs a lot of work, but I came up with a title now. The play will be called "The Flying Classroom". It's going to be great. Why is he doing that? It's probably for a bet. - Why isn't he afraid? - Of course he is. Otherwise he would have no courage. He just knows that nothing will happen if he's careful. Otherwise it would be foolishness. Only an idiot would do such a thing. - What happened, Sebastian? - Nothing in particular. We just asked Schreivogel to look out of the window to see if he's cross-eyed. - Who's cross-eyed? - Schreivogel. He is so cross-eyed that his tears flow down his back. Didn't you notice that? - Are you trying to pull my leg, kiddo? - You're way too big for that. Come on. We have to rehearse. Tell it again. What happened? The bastards from the Realschule attacked us on our way home. Let him go. We only need one. They captured Rudi Kreuzkamm and they took our dictation notebooks. The dictation notebooks, shit... No... Thank God! We're here. - Let the play begin! - We're not rehearsing today. Mischa, you're going into town to get the externals. Fips is going with you. You have one hour. In the meantime, we'll mobilize everyone here. That shouldn't be a problem. - What's all the unnecessary fuss for? - We'll have to free Rudi Kreuzkamm. We'll meet at the Nonsmoker's. The Nonsmoker. That's what they call a man whose real name they don't know. He's called Nonsmoker because he's living in an old railway carriage. Our boys often visit him. They like him a lot. Almost as much as their house teacher Dr. Bökh. - At least he's home. - You go inside. We'll wait for the others. Alright. - Hey brothers, are you on leave this afternoon? - No. - Not really. - Take a seat then. Thanks. - You don't happen to be Robert Uthofft, do you? - Yes, I am. Born. Baptized. Vaccinated. Called Nonsmoker. Only by my friends. Well, it's a bit much to ask. - I've been running around with this letter for three weeks now. - Poor you! And then it turns out that the guy is living in a railway carriage. Yes. No street, no house number. That's the beauty of it. Now hand it over... It's an official letter. From the registration office. Please sign here. - I don't care. That's your problem. - Great. What do you want to drink? - Apple juice. - Very well. I think the guys from the Realschule should let Rudi Kreuzkamm go but keep the dictation notebooks. - Otherwise I'll be in trouble. - I would love to be in your place. I'd love to have your bad marks if it meant I wasn't such a coward. I don't get you. It's up to you to change that. My Emmenthaler brain is genetic. I'll always be an idiot. I always try not to be such a coward. But in the end I always chicken out. Everyone thinks I'm a coward anyway. Then you have to do something to impress the others. Something really great. So that everybody says: Uli is a sensation! First of all, you'll have to find out if Rudi Kreuzkamm is already home. You do that, Sebastian. And afterwards, we'll meet at Egerland's place. - Michaelsberg 17. - We'll meet you there. Around the corner, that is. In the courtyard of the wine store. Who is this Egerland guy? - He's the leader of the pupils from the Realschule. - We might take him hostage if Rudi is still imprisoned. Then we can exchange them. Now you have to explain to me how this Egerland and his guys came up with the idea to kidnap one of you guys and to steal your highly-scientific works. That has a long history. The fight with the Real pupils is almost a tradition. It has been going on for 10 years or even longer. Actually it's more of an enmity between the schools than between the pupils. But we continue it because it has always been that way. And then they take revenge again... - So the assault today was an act of revenge? - Yes. - What for? - We stole their football. Not just an ordinary football. It had signatures of the national team on it. That was harsh! That's what our teacher Justus said. And he told us to return it immediately. At first we didn't want to. But then Justus threatened to stop talking to us for two weeks if we didn't return the ball within three days. An odd threat! Was it successful? The next day the ball was lying on the schoolyard of the Realschule. But prior to that, Friedel removed the signatures with glass paper. - That's why he has a black eye now. - Go out there and win! Maybe I'll come to the battlefield and treat the wounded. By the way, I'm starting to like your Justus. Now go on. And don't break someone's neck. Finally... We've been waiting for hours. - We're already starting to rot here. - Where are the rest? The others are waiting at the Holy Kunigunde. - I've got six. - Great! Come on. Let's go. Finally... Stop. Let's go over there. We'll stay here until we decide what to do. - Rudi is not at home. - Now it's an emergency. I'm going to beat up Egerland. - No, you're not. - Why not? He'll surrender in a second. That won't help us finding Rudi. What if I talked to Egerland... ... as a negotiator? - Maybe we can solve this through negotiation. - You have to give your enemy a chance. You sound like Justus. Let's take a vote. Who is in favor of negotiating? That's a majority. Go on, Sebastian. Excuse me, ... - ... I'm in your son's class. - What's going on today? First someone needs the key to the basement to park his bike. The second asks for a washing line. Five minutes later a horde of boys is running around here with their dirty shoes. Is your son alone right now? I have a question about our maths homework. He's in his room pretending to be studying. - Did you get back the key to the basement already? - No. - The left door. - Thanks. I can't believe it. Somebody from the Gymnasium. - You dare to come here all alone? - As you can see. I'm here as a negotiator anyway. - So? - We request the immediate release of our classmate Kreuzkamm. And we want the dictation notebooks back. What are you offering in return? Nothing. I'm just here to warn you. We are determined to free the captive. By means of violence, if necessary. You don't even know where he is. There is a way to avoid acts of aggression though. You send a letter to the national football team coach and ask him for a new ball. With all the signatures. You have to promise this with your word of honor. That might be possible. Then you send us a letter: "We behaved like pigs and want to apologize." Every one of you has to sign it. What if we refuse? We'll burn the dictation notebooks and Kreuzkamm won't be released. He's going to be a captive until he's an old man. And he's getting six slaps in his face every thirty minutes. Your conditions are unacceptable. I'm done here. What if they caught Sebastian as well? That was a stupid idea! Coming. Come on. Do you agree that we can't accept their conditions? Matz is right! Did you find out where Rudi is? I think he is in Egerland's basement. Mrs. Egerland was saying something about the key to the basement and a washing line. What are we waiting for? There are enough of us. They're probably guarding Rudi. What was that? Egerland is probably rounding up his men. - He has been warned now. - We have to attack immediately. Otherwise we'll be outnumbered. Let's go. Wait a second. You can't do that. Egerland has already rounded up 30 of his men. They are gathering at the construction site on Klettenweg. So what do you suggest? Why don't you have a duel? There's no need for everyone to fight. You and they each nominate one guy to fight. It's enough if two people beat up one another. If you win they have to release Kreuzkamm without further conditions. - Agreed. - They will probably nominate Wawerka. - Do you think you can handle him? - Sure. I'll punch his glass eye out of the porcelain socket. Matthias Selbmann will fight for us. - Heinrich Wawerka will fight for our side. - When will the fight be over? - When one of them flees or capitulates. - Alright. - Then you'll have to release Kreuzkamm and return the notebooks. - Yes, if your guy wins. - If our guy wins, you'll have to write the letters. - That won't happen. Well, go show him. Come on, Matz. Kick his ass! - Great, Matz. - Man, I was really worried about you. - Did you get hurt? - No way. I'm just hungry. You'll get a dozen bockwursts. You really earned them. - Thanks. - But first, we have to go get Rudi. What's going on there? My men don't want to release the prisoner. Are you mad? - I'm sorry. - You must have had your fart for breakfast. - We had an agreement, Egerland. - You're right. But they decided. I can't do anything. - Intolerable! - If I had known this, I would have turned Wawerka into fricassee. What's going on? Those jerks broke the agreement. In that case I'm sorry for proposing the duel. I assumed that they would keep their word. - I offer you myself as a hostage. - That's very respectable. But there's no point in imprisoning even more boys today. Go back to your men and tell them that we will attack in two minutes. For the last time, by the way. We're fed up with you. Come over here and listen. Sebastian, Matz and I will leave now. You know why. You just have to hold them back. - Martin, you'll be in charge. - Alright. We'll pretend to attack, then retreat and entrench ourselves in the new building. - Johnny, I'll go with you. - What? No, you better stay here and help retreat. That's what you're best at anyway. - Alright, Martin. You know what to do. - You're mean. There! Good luck, boys. Now it's time again. A half an hour is up. - That makes two. And that's... - ... the third. Finally. I've been tied up since half past one and it's 36 o'clock now. Four o'clock. It's four o'clock, Rudi. But you'll live. For me it's 36 o'clock. Six slaps in the face every 30 minutes. Six times six is 36. Let's tie them together. We have to get back. Just you wait. - Where are the dictation notebooks? - Over there. - I can't see them. You'll have to take a closer look. They burnt them in front of my eyes. Your old man won't be amused. It's my lucky day. I'll donate an urn for the ashes. - Do you want to slap them in the face? - No, thanks. You go back home at once. If your dad asks for the dictation notebooks, just say you forgot them at school. - And you had lunch at Friedel's. - Don't forget to be full up. - What are you doing? - We'll take the ashes with us. - Ashes? - Take that shovel over there. Now, let's get out of here. - There they are. - Did you free Rudi? Everything's alright. Rudi is at home. - Where are the notebooks? - Here. - I don't get it. - Because you're stupid. The notebooks are burnt. Listen, we'll attack them now. The four of us will attack from the right, the rest will attack from the left. When I give the signal you come out and get them. Let him go. It's not his fault that his men broke their promise. Uli? Where's Uli? Have you seen Uli? He's over there. - What happened, Uli? - Nothing in particular. I just ran away again. Wawerka, of all people, approached me. Believe me, I wanted to trip him up, but when I saw his face, it was over. Wawerka? I can understand that. Even I had difficulties dealing with him. - You just want to solace me, Matz. - No. But things can't go on like this. Something's got to happen. Come on, let's go. Handsome Theodor is probably already waiting for us. Come back here! You guys secretly went to the movies, right? Yeah. Great movie. The sheriff looked a lot like you, but not that handsome. I'll show y... Well, then let's go to Dr. Bökh now. Go on. Come on, friends. What are the rules of the house? The pupils are not allowed to leave the school... outside of the designated times. Are there any exceptions to that rule? Martin? Only if a teacher orders or permits pupils to leave the school. Exactly. So, who gave you the permission to leave? - No one. We just left. I told everyone to leave. It's my fault. I know you tend to assume responsibility, Johnny Trotz. We really had to leave. It was an emergency. Why didn't you ask me? It's my responsibility. You would have said no, but we would have left anyway. So, you would have ignored my decision? But that's not the point. Please wait a second, Laban. We're trying to resolve the issue. - Well, why did you leave? - Once again because of the pupils from the Realschule. - They captured Kreuzkamm. - They captured him? They captured him, tied him up and beat him. We had to rescue him. - Did you rescue him? - Yes, of course. - Did anyone get injured? - No... only a little. Anyway, I have to tell you that your behavior is... ... admissible. You did the right thing, you bandits. But still, you didn't follow the rules of the house. What's the usual punishment in this case, Laban? The pupils may not leave the school for 14 days. Let's see what we can do. One could say that... due to exceptional circumstances you just forgot to ask for permission. Why didn't you ask me? Damn! Why didn't you ask me? Don't you trust me? Then I should be punished. - It would be my fault... - No. Absolutely not, Jus..., Doctor! I thought about asking you, but then I felt it wasn't a good idea. It's not a matter of trust. I don't know... Probably because there were only two possibilities. If Dr. Bökh had said no, we would have left anyway. If he had given us his permission, he would have been responsible in case something happened. So, you didn't ask because you didn't want to cause inconveniences for me? All right. As a punishment you'll be grounded for two hours. - Laban, does this correspond to the rules of the house? - Of course. You'll spend the two hours here in my apartment. - Maybe the cafeteria will provide us with some coffee. - Some cake as well? - Let's hope so. ... Do you accept your punishment? - Yes! You are invited as well, Laban. I'm going to tell a story you might find interesting. Well, boys, see you in 15 minutes. In the meantime, let Nurse Beate take care of you. You look like robbers. Get out! That's it. - Were you on the run, Micha? - Me? Never. - The injury on your bottom would suggest that. - One of the Real pupils kicked me from behind while I had another one in a headlock. But I kicked his ass afterwards. Believe me, Nurse Beate. - I bit my tongue, Nurse Beate. - Show me. Go to the kitchen and get some ice cubes. - What about you? - I've got appendicitis, Nurse. I can see that. - We'll have to perform surgery. - Do you need help with the anesthesia? No, no. We don't need anesthesia. That doesn't look too good. Can you get me the boric acid solution from the cabinet? - And the eye-patch. - Where is it? - Right down at the bottom. That will help you. Now you look like a pirate. Do you need anything as well, Mr. Laban? - Yes, you. - I'm only available on prescription. - Do you have a prescription? - Maybe. - Then please show it. - But not right now. I just wanted to invite you to join us for coffee at Dr. Bökh's. Well. It was almost 30 years ago. There were boys here at this school back then as well. Just like you. Prefects like Laban. House teachers like me. And a young pupil who was new at the school. I'd like to tell you a story about him. He was hard-working like Martin. Always fighting with other boys like Matthias. And he was a little homesick. Like Uli. Well, he was very much like you. One day, his mother became very ill. She was... ... brought to a hospital here in Bamberg. You know that building... The boy was very upset because he feared for his mother. That's why he decided to leave the school premises without permission. He just wanted to see how she was doing. Will you visit me again tomorrow? He was sure he could come because the next day he would be allowed to leave school anyway. When he arrived back at the school, the prefect was already waiting for him. Unfortunately, it was one of those who did not yet know what's wrong and what's right. A prefect who misunderstood his position. Where have you been? Very well, you'll be grounded tomorrow. The next day, the boy left the school again of course. After all, he had made a promise to his mother. He ran across the whole town and sat next to her bed for an hour. She asked him to come again tomorrow and he said he would. Meanwhile, the prefect had told the teacher that the boy had left the school again without permission. Finally, the boy had to come here. Into this very room. The teacher was a grim man. One you could not confide in. You won't leave the school for four weeks. The next day the boy ran away again. Then he was locked up. But when the teacher came into the cell to talk to the boy, the wrong boy was sitting there. - What are you doing here? - The prefect... the prefect didn't know who... I'm here for my friend. This friend... was me. Robert Uthofft and I stayed friends for a long time. We shared a room, we studied together, he became a doctor and I... well, you know that. We even stayed friends after he got married. Then his wife had a child. But the child died. His wife died as well. He couldn't do anything to save them. The day after their funeral my friend disappeared. I haven't heard anything from him since then. There's one thing I don't understand. Why didn't you explain that your mother was ill? Things like that happen all the time. False reactions fueled by defiance towards a teacher you don't trust. Trust... Maybe that's the only reason I'm here. And told you this story. The two hours have passed. Would you like to go for a swim before dinner? I think I understood you very well, Dr. Bökh. That's a good thing, Mr. Laban. I would let myself be drawn and quartered in place of Justus, if necessary. - Did you hear the name of his old friend? - I didn't. - Robert Uthofft. - So what? Do you know him? - Yes, that's the Nonsmoker's name. - The postman said his name... - Did you buy this sausage at the supermarket? - No, it's from the butcher. It doesn't taste good. In Hesse they are currently debating whether pupils should be allowed to choose their own examination subjects. - I like that idea. - I knew you would. - By the way, where are the dictation notebooks? - They... they... I forgot to bring them because... I must have left them at the window sill in the hallway. That's so typical of you. It's the result of your style of upbringing, Gesine. Your style of upbringing, Mum... - Listen, what kind of bird is that? - It is... - It's a wild pigeon, Dad. - Or an eagle owl. Rudi, why do you have such red cheeks? Indeed. Now I see it as well. They're swollen. Just because my mouth is full. You can only hear the cock dove in the morning and in the evening. - When people watch TV or go to the movies. - The movies! Rudi, you reminded me of something. Thanks. - I'm meeting Annemarie. Good evening, Mom. - Good-bye, Inge. - Good-bye, Dad. - Which movie are you going to see? - "Love in the Morning" - That wouldn't be enough for me. - How did you come up with that? - Why not? Everyone's talking about these things at school. That must be a great school... - It's nice here. - You want some more? - Yes, please. - Well then, cheers. - Cheers. - He plays the same song every evening. - A funny guy. Imagine, he was a doctor once. But now he's totally freaked out. - Earning some money as an entertainer here. - Poor guy. He doesn't seem to mind. No, indeed, he looks rather happy. - Would you do me a favour? - I'll do everything you want. - Sure? - Of course. Then please fail at your school leaving examination. Why? If you don't fail, you'll move to Marburg in autumn and I have to stay here. Oh, now I get it. You allied yourself with senior teacher Lehmann. - Who? - Senior teacher Lehmann. He's a dumbass. - He gave me an F last week. - Poor you. Well, in physics. I don't care about that anyway. - I don't want to take classes in engineering... - ... but in law. - Aren't there too many applicants in Marburg? - No. - Too bad. But it's not a problem. Next year you'll be ready to come as well. - We'll study together. We'll live together. - In the same room? Why not? It's much cheaper. - You're a dreamer. - No, I am not. You have to admit that this kiss was very real. - By the way, even students can marry. - Dreamer! - No, I'm not. - Yes, you are. Good morning, Professor. What's that? - That was them. - Them? The dictation notebooks. The guys from the Realschule stole and burned them. - Did you ask them to do that? - No. That's so unlike you. - That's my old man. - Whom did I give the notebooks to? To me, Professor. But there were five of them and only two of us. Friedel and me. Before they burnt the notebooks they tied me up in a basement. - How long have you been in that basement? - Until four o'clock. - Didn't your parents notice anything? - No. You must have great parents. They didn't even miss you during lunch. They thought I'd eat somewhere else. Give your father my regards and tell him to take better care of you in the future. I'll let him know. There are many people who work out every morning. For instance, jogging or 25 squats in front of the open window. It's great training. And there are pupils who spell a few difficult words at the beginning of class. That's great training as well. - Autogenous training. - That's what you could call it, Mr. Frank. May I ask you to do the first squat? How do you spell "Pappplatten"? Paula - Anton - Paula - Paula - Ludwig - Anton - Thicko - Thicko... You're the thicko. There are three Paulas in the middle. Uli, spell the word "Schlämmkreide". Come on, Mr. von Simmern. Or do you need a written request? S - C - H - L - E - M - M... - K - R - E... - Are you crazy? Would you tell me what you're doing up there? - Get down immediately. - I can't. Let him down! Be careful. Not so fast! I'm sorry, Professor. Take out your essay notebooks! ... The dictation notebooks fell victim to the flames. "Liechtenstein liefert an Libyen... ... Schlämmkreide und Pappplatten. Schlämmkreide und Pappplatten, nummeriert und in Stanniol verpackt." Give me the notebooks! Come on! Thanks. See you tomorrow. Holy... That was a double-digit home defeat. Too bad Kreuzkamm took the notebooks himself this time. Maybe Egerland would have staged another attack if we had asked him. - No way, he's had it now! - Hey guys. Are you alright? By the way, you can leave school for two extra hours this afternoon. I asked Dr. Bökh. What's wrong with him? Maybe he thought about the story Justus told us. - We should bring the two together. - Justus and the Nonsmoker? I've got an idea how we can do this without raising suspicions. The Nonsmoker is playing the piano, right? We'll ask him to play the piano at our next rehearsal. And then we'll tell Justus to come to the gym. - Great idea. - Right? - Greetings. - Hello. - Have a look at my flowers. - They are really nice. A little delicate, but I really like them. - Do you want some strawberries? - Yes, please. - And we wanted to ask you something. - Go ahead. Johnny has written a play for the graduation ceremony. And we wanted to know if you were willing to help us with our next rehearsal. - Help you with what? - Playing the piano. I think it's called répiteur. - Répétiteur. The orchestra is rehearsing separately. - Ok. - I'm not very good. - It's just for the rehearsal. We'll rehearse the act in heaven first. St. Peter, up on your cloud. Go ahead, Matz. For people of your kind, heaven only appears to be in reach. You fly up in machines, you watch it through the ocular. But believe me, despite all this, heaven remains invisible to you. - Only... - Only the dead get to see heaven as it really is. Only the dead get to see heaven as it really is. - May I take some pictures? - No. Cameras are not allowed up here. We don't like such things. Explore whatever is to be explored. The unexplorable... The unexplorable... Matz, you've had the text for more than a week. Yes, but I can't remember things when I'm hungry. Anyone have some manna for St. Peter? What are we supposed to do, Johnny? St. Peter is talking already and we don't even exist yet. When you enter heaven, chorus and orchestra will play a hallelujah. Do you have a suggestion? Yes, I think I've got something. The painter with the brush without bristles. Get lost, you stink. Get lost, you stink. Get lost, you stink. To think that I finally found you again. - You see? It did work out. - Yes, a great plan. - Uli? - Yes, what is it? - You look really cute with your plaits. You should have been a girl. - I've had it. Now I will be doing it. - What are you going to do? Listen, everybody. I'm asking you to come to the school garden at four o'clock. I'm going to show you something. Please tell everyone. At four o'clock in the garden. It's very important. Everyone's got to come. Yup. That's my bungalow. - I can't believe it. - It's equipped with everything. Patio, garden and here... Swimming pool. Let's go inside. Non-smoker! It's really cozy. Sit down, Johannes. You know, it's not refrigerated, but I guess we can drink it anyway. - "1971 Würzburger Stein Silvaner Auslese". - 180 degree Oechsle... A Christmas present from the innkeeper. - Innkeeper? - Yes, my employer. You know, I don't need much money. The little I do need I earn playing the piano. Do you remember? To the corona! To the chairmanship! Multae causae sunt bibendi. Many reasons, but none of them is as good as this one. In such cases, my old man used to say: Boy, that tastes like honey. I remember him very well. He once said to me: Keep an eye on my Johannes. He's an idealist. Am I? I don't know. Although, I have to admit that I love my job. It's a pleasure to see that the boys trust me. - Sorry, Robert. - I know what you mean, Johannes. But I'm very happy here. I've never had so much time to think, to read - as in the years since... - Why did you give up? Not only those who commit foolishness are guilty, but also those who don't stop it from happening. I should have insisted on operating. I was a doctor myself. I should have known better. Maybe they would still be alive today. I should have become a gardener instead. - You used to be very ambitious. - Do you think of that as a virtue? Money, status, fame. Those are just toys. No real adult person would be interested in that. - Don't you want to try it again? - No. Dear Robert, you're pigheaded. - Someone told me that before. - Yes... - I did. - Cheers! - Where is Uli now? - Here I am. I'm going to prove that I'm not a coward. - Uli, you're insane. Get away from the window. - Get back. - No. - Get away right now. That's insane. Only idiots would do that. Open the door! Uli, don't do it! Don't jump. No! Mischa, Fips, get the stretcher from the ward. - Anyone know where Justus is? - Maybe at the Nonsmoker's. Sebastian, go and get them both. Martin, Johnny, get out. I'm a doctor. Scissors! A bad lower leg fracture. - An artery has been damaged as well. Do you have some basic surgical equipment? - Yes. - Sterile? - Yes. - Call an ambulance. He needs to get to a hospital. I'll pinch off the artery. This is Dr. Bökh from Aufseesianum. We need an ambulance immediately. - Scalpel! I'll have to open it up further. - Yes, it's an emergency. An accident. Uli won't make it for the play. The right leg was totally contorted. It's definitely fractured. - Who's going to take his part in the play? - Rudi Kreuzkamm maybe. Who cares about that at the moment? Let me through, boys! - Is it bad? - Nothing life-threatening. An artery is damaged. Dr. Uthofft pinched it off. - Dr. Uthofft? - Yes, a friend of mine. What is it? Uli broke his leg. And an artery was damaged. That's why he bled so much. But now the danger is over. Dr. Uthofft will go to the hospital with him. It could have been worse. There's one thing I don't get. How did he get that insane idea? - He wanted to prove that he's not a coward. - It's all my fault. I told him to do something that would impress the others. That he did! Well, I'm going to call Uli's father now. Mr. von Simmern's office. Mr. von Simmern is out of town. I can't reach him at the moment. When will it be possible to reach him? His son had an accident. Maybe the day after tomorrow. He'll arrive in Johannesburg then. No, Mrs. von Simmern is with her husband. - Alright, I'll try my best, Doctor. - Thanks. I'm not hungry. Pull yourself together, Matthias. A fractured leg might be better than Uli feeling disrespected for the rest of his life. - Go back to your table. - Yes, Doctor. - By the way, Matz. - Yes? This letter for Mr. Martin Thaler just arrived. Via airmail express. Give it to him. Here. It's from Mombasa. From my parents. Can I get the stamp? - You can have it. - Thanks, great. - Go on, draw. - Play. - Who's winning? - Matz is. Who else? Mombasa, 10th of July. Dear Martin, this is a sad letter. You know that we are trying to set up our own business over here. After some initial progress, we've lately suffered a setback. My dear Martin, that's why we can't come to Germany to spend the holidays with you. We can't even send you a plane ticket because we have to save money. Please don't take it to heart. Maybe we'll see each other on Christmas. Christmas. What are your parents writing? Are they okay? - Yes. - When will they come? Listen for a second. I just talked to Dr. Uthofft. Given the circumstances, Uli's condition is fine. We can count ourselves lucky that the accident did not lead to disaster. But I would ask you to demonstrate your courage as inconspicuously as possible in the future. I won't accept fractured legs as evidence. Now, off to bed. - Good night, boys. - Good night, Doctor. Gang of rascals... - Martin? - Yes? You didn't answer my question. I wanted to know when your parents are coming. I don't want to talk about it at the moment. - These roses are lovely. - Yeah. Mine aren't bad either. You should have a look at them. Do you really live in a railway carriage, Doctor? Yes. Decoupled. Station "allotment". End of voyage. - How about a coffee? - Sounds great. Maybe over there. - Here you go. - Two coffees. No, one coffee and a glass of wine. No, wait, two coffees. I had a little too much last night. My friend Johannes visited me at the inn. I've been here for over a year now. - Strange that I've never met him before. - He doesn't go out very often. - Johannes, the idealist. - That's true. For me, REASON is in capital letters. Do you think that's wrong? - Well, I kind of built my... - ... own philosophy. - Yeah, maybe that. - And what do you think about Professor Lepin's suggestion? I've got to sleep on this for a few nights. - I wouldn't be a good doctor anymore after all these years. - It didn't look like that when you operated on Uli. Beate, when will you come visit me at my refuge? Soon. Come in. Hello, Uli. - Here. - Thanks. The nurse will get a vase. I'll put them in the sink for now. How are you doing, kiddo? - Good. Am I a sensation now? - Of course. A total sensation. None of us would have dared to do that. Not even you, Matz? Not for a million... - Really? - Never. - What are the others saying? - They are all quite impressed. They have a lot of respect for you now. In that case, my leg doesn't hurt anymore. Not a bit. Sebastian, have a look in the drawer. - There's some chocolate inside. - This one? - Yes. It's from the principal. Give it to Matz. - I can't take it. Yes, you can. Otherwise I'll get upset. And the Nonsmoker forbid me to get upset. When I woke up from anesthesia, the first thing I saw was the face of the Nonsmoker. - Did they operate on you? - Yes. Dr. Uthofft did the operation. Together with a doctor from the hospital. How is our skydiver doing? Temperature is normal. No complications obviously. - And who is taking care of your flowers now? - I look after them in the evenings. I'm here as a vacation replacement. - Great. - Dr. Uthofft! - Yes, Professor? Give him some penicillin. Just as a precautionary measure. Your acrobat will be back soon. - Great. - I recommend hiding all umbrellas. Can you pick me up here in 30 minutes? Yes. I'll just return some records to Annemarie in the meantime. By the way, Inge. That was hardly an appropriate good-bye considering we'll be apart for such a long time. Man, that's Rudi's sister. From the virgins' aquarium. She doesn't look like the old Kreuzkamm. Leave her alone. She'll distract Handsome Theodor from us. You're right. - That's none of your business. - I just meant that Uli is getting better. - You'll see for yourself. - Oh, great. Yeah, right. - Who's going to take Uli's part in the play now? - Rudi Kreuzkamm wasn't such a bad idea. But we'll have to make an exact time schedule. No problem. The dress rehearsal is on the 24th and the show is on the 25th. And on the 26th we'll be on holidays. Yes, please. What's wrong? I..., I would like to ask you for permission to stay at school during the holidays. What? - Don't you want to spend the holidays with your parents? - Yes, but... - Well, they don't want to? - They want to as well. So you want to and your parents want to too, but you'll stay here anyway? - Well, what's the problem? - I'd prefer not to talk about that. Very good. Be quiet. Justus is coming. - Good morning. - Good morning, Doctor. What's our subject for today? What was it? - Geography. - Right. The state, which is taking care of us so very well, gave us a surprising present. What do you see in front of the house? A masterpiece of modern aircraft construction. We'll fly over continents and watch the Earth from above. We'll sail through the clouds, the Moon and the stars. High above mountains and valleys, to places far away. - From now on, we'll use our eyes to learn. - How nice! - School becomes an adventure. - That's exactly how I like it. Italy. We'll just fly there. My atlas will burn in the fire. Class is about to begin. - We'll board the plane. - Wait, ladies first. You have to be polite. We've got ham sandwiches and fuel. The world is expecting us. At the pole and where the palms bloom, class will become an on-site inspection. The engine sounds are starting, the classroom is taking off. It's a pity you couldn't be here in the morning. Unfortunately, we couldn't make it. Our plane only arrived in Frankfurt at noon. - I'll tell you everything. - Don't strain yourself too much, my boy. I won't. I'm already cured. Almost... Johnny's play had five acts. After they took off, they landed in Naples first. At Mount Vesuvius, Justus, who was played by Sebastian, explained the composition of the Earth's crust and the interior of the Earth. Everything in verse, of course. Afterwards, he took a cigar and used the fire of the volcano to light it. That was the highlight of the second act. In the third act, in front of the Pyramids of Giza, they talked about the fertile Nile region, the Sphinx and the ancient graves of the kings. When Rudi, who played the little girl, made a stupid remark, the mummy of King Ramses appeared and lured the girl into his dark grave. The poor girl had to stay with the pharaoh. In the final act, they had to make an emergency landing as the elevator malfunctioned. They ended up at St. Peter's, in Heaven. He told them that it's impossible to enter paradise in a plane. But it's easy on the other hand, because all you have to do is to believe. Johnny added this line during the dress rehearsal. As usual, Matz forgot his line in that scene. Explore whatever is to be explored. The unexplorable... - The unexplorable... Damn. - The unexplorable leave unexplored. The unexplorable leave unexplored. We heard that you know everything. Did you know we're missing a little child? It followed Ramses and disappeared. Now she is lost in the labyrinth of the pyramid. Poor child. I will say an incantation that will bring back what was lost. All things having passed remain, the path keeps its steps. What was tattered remains written, come and step into our midst. There she is. - How are you? - Thanks a lot. - Now it's time to get back. - Otherwise we'll be in trouble. - Principal Grünkern is awaiting us. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - And have a great holiday! There we are. - Flying was a nice dream. - A dream that won't come true. But why not? What would you say if I invited the whole class? Would you really do that? - And Justus as well? - Yes. What destination do you suggest? - Mombasa. - Mom...? - Is that too far? - Well... - Why Mombasa of all places? - Because of Martin Thaler. His parents live there. And he never gets to see them. Then... Mombasa it is. East Africa is supposed to be great anyway. You two? What a surprise. Are you coming with us? No, we're flying to Venice. She's insisting on it. Hopelessly nostalgic. ... says the guy living in a railway carriage. - Only on the weekends, my dear Johannes. - Otherwise the hospital is too far. Robert, I'm really glad to hear that. Take care, Uli. Yes, Daddy. - Have a pleasant flight! - You too. - Good-bye, boys. - Good-bye. - Am I too heavy? - No way. Stay calm, people. Not everyone can have a seat at the window. - We've got ham sandwiches and fuel. - The world is expecting us. In Africa where the palms bloom, class will become an on-site inspection. Why is it forbidden? - You speak German! - Yes, because of my dad. He's an aircraft captain. Come over here, Johnny. Now you'll fly this thing. Straight ahead so that we'll arrive in Nairobi on time.
