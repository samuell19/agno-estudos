(dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (eerie music) (robot beeping) (machine whirring) (computer beeps) (suspenseful music) (machines humming) - [Robot] Lord Commander, Lord Commander. - [Commander] Why have you woken me? - [Robot] Lord Commander, we are approaching a planet most suitable for the hunt. - [Commander] Good, what planet? - [Robot] It is known as Earth. - [Commander] Prepare the star hunter. - [Robot] By your command. (spaceship zooms) (crowd chatting) - Hey, Pichel. - What? - Just a game. - It's just another loss. - It's not whether you win or lose, you know. (laughing) - You almost said that with a straight face. Come on, we're gonna miss the bus. - You already missed it. - What? - Team bus was full. We're catching a ride with Ms. Marsh. - You're kidding, Ms. Marsh. - Do I look like I'm kidding? Hey, Coop, think fast. - Way to go, dick. (suspenseful music) (spaceship hums) (suspenseful music) (dog barks) (suspenseful music) (coughs) (suspenseful music) (man grunting) (suspenseful music) (spaceship beeping) (electricity hums) (man grunts) (electricity hums) (suspenseful music) - [Homeless Man] Hey, are you somebody in there? Hey, I see you, come here. (electricity hums) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - Isn't anybody going to say anything? - What's there to say, we lost. - What's this we crap. We didn't even get a chance to play. The team lost. All we did was park our asses on the bench. - I'm sense a little bit of hostility from you, Johnny Football. - Calm down back there. We all lost. Carrie, can you come help me with the map, please? - What did we do, make a wrong turn? - Yeah, something like that. - Hasn't it occurred to you guys that we're really not even on the team? Hell, we don't even get to ride on the team bus. The bus with all the cute cheerleaders. - Sit on it, Spivak. - The team bus was overloaded. - That's why we got stuck with the bimbo cheerleader. - [Boy] Shut up, Spivak. - Yeah, you don't know me. - Just about the only football player on the team that doesn't. - I said, shut up. - Stop it, you guys. - All right. (tires squeal) Cut it out, you guys. Spivak, I've had just about enough out of you. - Sorry, Ms. Marsh. - Dick. - Cooper, what are you doing back there? - Nothing. - Well, keep doing it. Now, where are we? - I think if we go left, we can get back on the freeway. - Let's do it. - I think we'll stick to our original plan, shall we? - Yeah, get a clue, Spivak. (engine revs) (dramatic music) ♪ We're off to see the wizard ♪ The wonderful wizard of Oz - [Spivak] Come on, everybody. - Cooper, you are smoking back there, aren't you? Pichel, find out if Cooper's smoking. Coop, Cooper. - What? - Hey, Ms. Marsh wants to know if you're smoking. - No. - No, no, he says no. - Fine. - Ms. Marsh, are you sure we're headed the right way? - Better check the map. (dramatic music) - [Spivak] What did you do, go the wrong way? - [Carrie] Shut up, Spivak. - [Spivak] I think I know where we are. - [Ms. Marsh] Quiet down folks and let me drive. - [Spivak] Or maybe not. (dramatic music) (computer beeps) (chirping) Hey, what's going on? - [Ms. Marsh] The power's going. - What is it? (engine revs) - Damned if I know. - You want me to check under the hood? - Yes, Pichel, would you do that please? - You got it. (banging) - Ms. Marsh? I think we're in the hood. - No, we didn't go that way. - Better check the map again. - My mom's gonna kill me if I'm late again tonight. - That's one of the more pleasant thoughts I've heard all day. - Be quiet. - Oh, give it a try. (engine revs) All right, forget it, give it up. (insects chirping) - What's the verdict? - I don't know. It's Detroit to me. - Everything obviously isn't, otherwise we'd be moving by now. - Would you like to take a look at it, Spivak. - Not me, I don't do it. - All right, who's got a quarter? (dramatic music) (hood slams) (insects chirping) (buzzing) - Ow! - What's the noise? (buzzing) - Sounds like a computer modem. - Like you'd know. - Give me it. - Want it? - Give me the phone. - Boys. - Ms. Marsh, I checked the map, I think we are in the heights. - Ah. - So where are all the friendly neighborhood junkies? - Hiding from your scary face. - All right, let's go find another phone. - Shouldn't watch them? - I don't wanna go. - I'm not leaving anybody alone in this neighborhood. Let's go. (dramatic music) (knocks) You too, Cooper. - My headphones don't work. - Good. Then you can join the real world for a while. (laughing) (suspenseful music) (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) - I believe I have located it. Rodney, now. - [Woman] He is several chirods from the planet Earth. - Earth. How is it classified? - [Woman] Empty. - Dominant specie? - [Woman] Human, subject is an escaped criminal, proceed with extreme caution. - Understood. (spaceship hums) (suspenseful music) - Do you think anyone lives in these buildings? - Norman Bates and his mother. - You actually think you're funny? Ms. Marsh, why don't we just hotwire a car? - Can the humor, Spivak. - You okay, Ms. Marsh? - No. Where is Cooper? - He was just here. - Pichel and Spivak, go back and find him. - You got it. - Is it just me or are things getting weird? - Just you. - He can't be far. We'll wait for you right here. (footsteps echo) (spaceship zooms) - Coop. Coop, where are you? (suspenseful music) Cooper? (suspenseful music) Cooper? This ain't funny, man. (suspenseful music) - Later. Ms. Marsh, he's nowhere to be found. - Get your butt over here, Cooper. (insects chirping) Cooper, where were you? - Okay, okay. - Spit it out, Coop. - Okay, there's like a, there's like a monster made out of lightning smoke in the alley way. Really. - I don't doubt that. Come on, let's go find a phone. (suspenseful music) - This place gives me the creeps. (suspenseful music) (beeping) (suspenseful music) Same thing. - Hey, maybe there's someone in the office? - There's a light on. Looks good, let's try it. (footsteps echo) Hello? Hello? Hello? Looks like nobody's here. I guess we better keep walking. - Please don't. - Oh. Hello. - It's very dangerous here. - Yes, I know. Who are you? - I am the caretaker of this warehouse. My name is Reicher. It's all right. Please come up. (suspenseful music) (footsteps echo) - I'm Chris Marsh, vice principal of Central High School. Our van broke down and we're wondering if we might use your phone. - Hey, you got any food? - Yeah. - Of course. Follow me. - Spivak. - Charm school drop out. (suspenseful music) - This way please. (suspenseful music) - Ms. Marsh. - Leslie, it's okay. - Hey, it's better than outside. (suspenseful music) - Hey, check out the home defense system. Are they real? - Oh yes. (suspenseful music) - What's the arsenal for? - What do you use them for? - I am a hunter and a collector. - Can you see or are you blind? - I am totally blind, but I am fine. I know where everything is, and there is more than one way to sense one's prey. - Like, can you tell how many people are in the room? - Six. - But I-- - Not including myself. - That's incredible. - Yeah, and kind of dangerous, don't you think? How do you know you're not gonna shoot another human being? - Each species makes its own distinct sound when fleeing. That is a very unusual tobacco the young man is smoking. - Cooper, put it out. - Sorry, sir. - I heard that if you lose one sense, that the other sense become more highly developed. - Not if you're Cooper. - There are compensations. A bat, for instance, may be blind, but its sonar system permits it to seek out moving prey while avoiding stationary objects. - That would be a remarkable accomplishment for a human being. I think we should just make our call and go. - Of course. The phone is upstairs. I will call a taxi for you, but in this area, it takes them quite a while to respond. However, there is food in the kitchen and you may eat while you wait. - Cool. (footsteps echo) - Pichel. (suspenseful music) - Hey, can I use your bathroom? (dramatic music) - Not again, Cooper. - No, I really mean it this time. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (beeping) - [Spaceman] Don't be alarmed. - Who? Dude, what are you? - [Spaceman] I'm here to help you. - Whatever. (buzzing) (dramatic music) (insects chirping) - What's the matter, sweetheart? - She should have been home hours ago. - I know, I'm getting worried, too. - I think we oughta make a couple of calls. (suspenseful music) - Cooper sure is taking a long time. This is all we could find, guys. (suspenseful music) - Hey, Cooper. Everything come out all right? - Coop, are you okay? - Oh, God. He's really in wacky land. - Coop, are you all right? - This way, Coop, remember? The ancestors learned this a few million years ago. - [Spivak] Way to go, Cooper. - Oh. - No. (laughing) - Coop. - [Carrie] Nice manners. - I think I'm gonna be sick. - Bathroom's down the hall. - Here, I'll help you find it. - Yeah, I bet. - Shut up, Spivak. - Ms. Marsh. - I agree, shut up, I'm trying to think. (suspenseful music) - Hey, you really don't feel well? (suspenseful music) I didn't think so. - Oh. I didn't mean to stop you. - No, it's cool, man. - Where's the bathroom? - That door. - Thanks, man. (suspenseful music) - [Reicher] You're welcome. (suspenseful music) - What a weirdo. - Come on. Jeez. - Oh my gosh. Who is this guy? - I don't know. But we are alone. (suspenseful music) - So... - So... That's a very interesting looking La-Z-Boy over there, don't you think? - Sure is. (sirens blaring) (phone rings) - You gonna get that? - I'm eating. - Well, I'm eating, too. (phone rings) - Tell you what, I'll flip you for it. Heads, you take it. - Fine. - Looks like heads. - Two out of three. - No way. (laughing) Deals a deal. - Hello? - Yeah, this is Jack Turner. Listen, I'm calling about my daughter. She isn't home yet, and well, it's just not like her to be this late. I mean, she was supposed to take the bus home right after the game. - We haven't had any accident reports. What's her name? - Carrie Turner. Yeah, I know, well, all right, that's Central High School. She's only 17. - Well, if we come across anything, I'll let you know, okay. - Fine, fine. - Anything? - Guy's daughters a little late getting home. Probably out having a good time. - Kids. (suspenseful music) - Reicher's taking a long time to make a phone call. What's he need all that stuff for? - [Carrie] Bad neighborhood. - Hey, no neighborhood's that bad. - He said he was a collector. - I am. - You really hunt? - Hunting is the supreme sport. Whenever I possible, I use the weapons of the species I hunt. It's more exciting. - You mean, you put antlers on your head and wrestle down deer? (laughing) - Has somebody joined us? - No. (suspenseful music) - The taxi company said it may be more than an hour. - I thank you. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. - Oh, no, not at all. I'm usually alone. You have no idea how wonderful it is to have life around me. - May I use your phone? I'd like to phone the parents and assure them everything is all right. - Of course you may. Follow me. (suspenseful music) - Stop. They're going to miss us. - Nobody ever misses us. - Come on. - Yeah, come on. (suspenseful music) (laughing) (suspenseful music) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (buzzing) - Is something wrong? - No, I... It's making that noise again. - Oh, that is very unpleasant. Shall we try later? (suspenseful music) - Mr. Reicher, how long have you lived here? - Not very long. I don't stay anywhere very long. I like to travel. - That must be difficult considering your disability. - I prefer a challenge. - Well, you certainly have one in this part of town. No offense. - No offense taken, I assure you. I thrive. - I better check on the kids. - Of course. Follow me. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - That's Leslie. (suspenseful music) (crying) (suspenseful music) - Get away from her, Pichel. - Touch me. (suspenseful music) - It's unfortunate. You've begun the game too soon. - What do you mean by that? - Eat and rest. We begin in an hour. - What did he mean about a game? - I don't know and I don't care. Let's go. - Ms. Marsh, he's got heads back there. He's got human heads. - What? - Yeah right. - Look. (suspenseful music) - Oh my god. - [Spivak] Are they real? - [Pichel] Why don't you ask one? (suspenseful music) - What are the other ones for? - Ms. Marsh, is this a game? - We're getting out of here now, now. - Come on. Let's go. (dramatic music) Go down the stairs, come on. Let's go. - Run! - Hurry, come on! (dramatic music) - Carrie, get Cooper, go to the door. - [Carrie] Come on, Cooper. (dramatic music) (gun cocks) (dramatic music) - [Robot] Prime targets, humanoid bipeds. Indigenous weapons of species, semi automatic and gun, single shot projectile. Ultimate weapon type primitive explosive rocket launcher. You are now fully activated to begin the game. Regenerative powers are in process. Do you understand? I am teleporting back to mother ship. We'll continue transmission intermittently. (dramatic music) (machines humming) - Come on. (dramatic music) - [Robot] Activating shield now. (beeping) (dramatic music) (electricity hums) (dramatic music) - I think we can rest here for a few moments. - There's gotta be someone around here. - These buildings are all condemned from quake damage. It's completely deserted. - What about homeless people, gang members? They're supposed to be all through the heights. - What was that room? - It's like a trophy room in a hunting lodge. Except that lunatic hunts humans, too. - I don't get it. How can he hunt, he's blind? - Yeah, it's not like he'd be any good at it. - Many he drugs the food. - I ate the food. - Nobody's been drugged, okay? - Hey, you guys can talk about this all you want, but I'm gone. - Spivak, we're staying together. - It's no good. I'm not stopping till I get home. - Spivak, stay with us! (suspenseful music) (beeping) - Game begins. Six targets. Humanoid bipeds, skill level moderate. Begin target now. (beeping) (dramatic music) - Which way did he go? - I don't know. (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) - [Robot] Sonar cloaking activated. (dramatic music) - What's that sound? - I don't know. Let's try this way. (chirping) (dramatic music) - Oh man. (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) (dramatic music) - [Robot] Targets in range. (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (footsteps echo) (dramatic music) No targets destroyed. (dramatic music) - Run, run! (dramatic music) (gun fires) - Spivak. - Oh my gosh are you okay? - What happened? - He hit something. - What? - Don't you hear that? (buzzing) - It sounds like power lines. - Exactly. - There are no lines here. - What the hell was that? - An electro magnetic force field functioning as a repellent against solid object. - When did you get so smart, Cooper? - You mean, like I barrier. - I guess. - Keep people out. - Or to keep us in. (suspenseful music) - [Robot] Warning, warning, zone three escape attempt fail. (suspenseful music) Shields up. (buzzing) - We've gotta keep moving. We've gotta get out of here. - Calm down. - There was this thing in the alley. - Reicher? - I didn't get a good look at it, but it had all its weapons. It was moving fast. - Whoever it was is gone now. Can you stand up? - What hit me? - We're still trying to figure that one out. - If we can hear this thing, maybe we can find a way around it. - What about Reicher? - We still have the advantage here. We can see him but he can't see us, come on. (buzzing) (suspenseful music) - Doesn't this thing ever end? - No, I think Reicher's warehouse is in the center of this barrier. In which case, according to the street signs, we've been traveling in an arc. - You mean, the barrier's circular. - Precisely. If we continue to follow this around, we'll eventually reach the point at which we started. - You think Reicher could be responsible for this? Like that orb puts out some kind of force field or something? - I don't know how a person could have the power to do this. - Well somebody does. (suspenseful music) - [Robot] Tracking targets. (suspenseful music) - If this barrier goes all the way around, that means we're trapped, and that pretty much eliminates our options. If we can't run, we're gonna have to fight. - Someone has got to know about this barrier. Someone has got to know that we're in here. - No one comes to this part of town unless they're lost. - Like I said, we're gonna have to take care of ourselves. (footsteps echo) We have to fight. - We can't even win a stinking football game. - Look, there's a lot of things I don't understand, but this much I do. He's one person. Blind. Hell, there's six of us. He's armed, so are we. Now come on. Let's blow this guy away. (suspenseful music) (metal clangs) - Locked. - Well now what are we gonna do? - Shut up, Spivak. Damn. We have to go back, come on. (suspenseful music) (knocking) Let's try that door over there. - Come on, Coop. - Come on, you guys. - Pry it open, hurry. - Let's try. - With what? - Carrie, squeeze through. I got you, Cooper. - [Robot] Target in range. - What's this now? - [Leslie] Come on, you guys, come on. (suspenseful music) - Hurry, hurry. - On three. - [Carrie] Lift it higher. - Oh my gosh, get down. (gun firing) (dramatic music) - [Carrie] Ms. Marsh. Pichel, she got hit. - Ms. Marsh. - Oh god. (dramatic music) - Up here. (guns firing) (dramatic music) Come on! (dramatic music) Hurry, Carrie. (gun firing) (dramatic music) Come on! (dramatic music) (footsteps echo) (gasping) (computer beeping) - Time elapsed, nine keylars. One kill, five targets remaining. Wound superficial. Resume game. (beeping) (dramatic music) - Maybe we're doing the wrong thing. - What, trying to stay alive? - Running. Reicher said every species makes a distinct sound while fleeing. - Yeah, well I think we should keep making that sound. - No, we gotta get back to the others. (footsteps echo) - Is she dead? Where's the rifle? - Carrie has it. - What was that thing? - I don't know. It was wearing the same red light Reicher had on. Maybe it's him. - But it didn't look human. (suspenseful music) (footsteps echo) - [Robot] Human trophy collected. (thunder rumbles) (rain falls) - Oh great, it's raining. How's it doing that inside the barrier? - Water must be able to get in. - Either that or he controls it, turns it on and off whenever he wants. - I don't even wanna know. - Look, you're right. We gotta find the others. We've got the only gun. (thunder rumbles) - We need to find some lights. (dramatic music) Great, Coop, got anything bigger? (dramatic music) Where did you? - In the van. They're great at concerts. (thunder rumbles) - [Carrie] Oh no, it's a dead end. - [Pichel] Not over there. (robot beeping) (dramatic music) (banging) Hey, over here! (gun fires) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (robot beeping) (rain falls) (gun fires) (rain falls) Come on, let's go. (gun fires) (dramatic music) (metal clangs) (dramatic music) You okay? - I'll live. - You'll be all right, walk it off. Hey, I think we made it past the shield. - Maybe when I shot it, it weakened the barrier. - What about the others? You think they got out? - I don't know but let's go get help. (dramatic music) (robot beeping) (dramatic music) - Time elapsed 11 keylars. Wound major. Game on hold for regeneration. (robot beeping) (dramatic music) - Wait. I don't think bringing that in would be a good idea. - Maybe you're right. (door squeaks) - [Police] Would you mind repeating that? - Ms. Marsh is dead. - And our friends are in trouble. - I mean the part about the space monster. - He collects heads. - Human heads, look, you gotta believe us. - We'd like to believe you. It's just that nothing unusual has been reported. Like gun shots. - It's probably the force field. - Force field? - You know your dad called here wondering where you were? - We'll take you to her body. - You gotta help us. If you don't believe us, we'll show you. - It's been a slow night, John. - Let's go, and this better be good. (robot buzzing) (dramatic music) - Wound regenerated. Resume game. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Ouch. Sorry, Cooper. - What's that smell? - No, my perfume. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - [Robot] Searching for targets. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - [Spivak] Quick, take your shirts off. - No way. - Come on, it's not a thrill for me. You heard Reicher. That thing about his senses. - Oh my god, you're right. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (beeping) - [Robot] Sensors reckoning. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) Wrong sensor. Incapacitated. Warning, warning, warning. Crises of evil. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - [Leslie] Hurry, Cooper. Go, go, go. Go Spivak. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - [Robot] Argue with the races of evil. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (siren blaring) (suspenseful music) - It's this way. (suspenseful music) - It's right over here. (suspenseful music) It's gone. - You're sure this is the place. - [Group] Yeah. - There's no blood. - Maybe you guys have the wrong alley. - It was here. - Maybe that thing's still alive. - Look, I've had enough fun for one night. - You can't leave. What about our friends? - Come on, we can find Ms. Marsh's body. - Look, I'm taking you back to the station, young lady. Your father's worried about you. - Can't believe this. - Now come on, move it. - Let's go guys. (suspenseful music) - Come on, come on. (footsteps echo) (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) - Thank you, Spivak. - Why don't you guys put something on? - This stuff? - Yeah, this stuff. - Okay, okay. (suspenseful music) If you're out of it this long, that must have been pretty good dope. Why didn't it attack us? - You didn't hear that yelling? - I was too scared. - It was Pichel and Carrie. It's after them now. (suspenseful music) - Your dad's gonna be here soon. - I can't stop wondering if they're all right. (phone rings) - We can go back. - The rifle's still out front. (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) - Come on. (suspenseful music) - Thought you guys could use some coffee. Hey, you guys, looks like you lost a couple over here. - Oh. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) - Hold up. (insects chirping) I guess the barrier's still down. This is where it was, right? - Think so. - Let's go find the others. (robot buzzing) - [Robot] Power source regenerated. Activate shields now. (buzzing) - What was that? - Must be the barrier. - Come on. - Leslie, Cooper. - Cooper. - [Carrie] Where are you guys? - That's Carrie. - Or that thing. - Cooper. - Let's go find out. (suspenseful music) Where's that creature? - We don't know. But the barrier's back up. - Thing's not human. It's not like anything I've ever seen before. - Is it some kind of alien. - Maybe it's a government experiment. - No. - Hey, Coop. Maybe it's that smoke monster you were talking about, huh? - No. I don't think so. - We can figure this out later. So what do we do now? - All right, I say we go back to the warehouse. - Any particular reason or did you think it'd be cozy? - Look, the barrier's gotta have some kind of a power source, right? Maybe it's that light thing we saw. Come on. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) Wait. (suspenseful music) Go get the orb. (suspenseful music) - It's Ms. Marsh. (suspenseful music) - Do it. (suspenseful music) - [Robot] Source break down. Damage source. Auxiliary power activated. 20 keylars to complete shut down. (sirens blaring) (suspenseful music) - He couldn't have gotten far, John. - And this time I say we book 'em. - They're just kids. First we gotta catch 'em. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) I got a bad feeling about this. - [John] Can say that again. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Hey, back with it. (gun firing) - Shit! (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Stop hitting the right all light. (dramatic music) (guns firing) - Shit! John, what did you say? I'm hit. I'm going down. (guns firing) (dramatic music) (groaning) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (explosion) (screaming) (fire crackles) (footsteps echo) - Are you sure that thing controlled the barrier? - I checked the whole warehouse. It's the only power source we could find. - There's no phones here. Reicher was lying. - Duh, like you believed him. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - [Robot] Searching targets. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Less than six hours ago, we walked up those steps. Ms. Marsh was still alive. - It's gonna be okay. I promise you, it's gonna be okay. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - [Robot] Targets in range. - Alert, danger, alert, danger, alert, danger. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (screams) (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Leslie, no! - [Carrie] Leslie. (guns firing) (dramatic music) Leslie. (guns firing) (dramatic music) Go, go! (robot buzzing) - No! Leslie, Leslie. - Out the front door, grab Cooper. (suspenseful music) Come on, Pichel. - Come on, Pichel. - Come on! It's okay. - Dude, come on. - Hurry. Hurry up! - Come on. Come on. - [Carrie] Come on. - [Pichel] Go! (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Come on, you guys. Hurry. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Time elapsed, 12 keylars. (suspenseful music) Wound moderate, two kills, four targets remaining. (suspenseful music) Wound regenerated, resume game. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (metal clangs) (suspenseful music) - It'll be day light in a while. - [Spivak] You mean, if we live that long. - Pichel, you okay? - Won't anything kill it? I don't think errors gonna hold it too long. - Just so we have enough time to get back to the van. - The van? - We knocked out the barrier, so maybe the van'll start and we can get out of here. - That's a pretty big maybe. - No. It's the best plan we've got. Come on, Pitch. - Come on. - Come on, man, let's go. Come on. (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) (engine revs) - Maybe it's out of gas. - There's plenty of gas. The gas! Bullets won't stop that alien, but nothing can withstand fire. - What are you talking about? We need to get the hell out of here. - The barrier's a couple blocks that way. Let's get out of here and see if it's still there. (dramatic music) - It was here. - You sure? - Yeah. I'm the one that found it. - Wait a minute. (dramatic music) (buzzing) - Can't believe it's still up. - We destroyed that light. - Reicher must have fixed it. Or maybe it doesn't power the barrier. - Then we shouldn't be out in the open. - Come on, guys. We can figure this out. We can do it. - Look at us, Spivak, we're not exactly the first string, okay? - Yeah, but this isn't a game. - It is to that creature, and have you ever known us to win a game? (dramatic music) What did you say about fire? (dramatic music) - About how many is that so far? - This will be six. We could use another dozen. - Round here that's not gonna be too hard. - Hey, Pichel, come here. What's that look like to you? - Looks like an alley. - No, use your imagination. We get on the roof, we can trap the alien. - That's a good idea. - Carrie. Look. If we get the thing up here, it falls through the roof, then we can hit it with the fire bombs. Nothing can live through that. - Well, how do we get it on the roof? - This is the good part. - Well, we'd be the bait. - And we need a way to confuse the sonar. - Foil. (dramatic music) - What? - Foil. I have a cousin who used to make tinfoil hats out of the foil to stop radar waves, you know, homeless people love it, that and a string. - It could work. - It's worth a try. - Let's do it. - Come on. (dramatic music) - [Robot] No targets destroyed. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (glass clinking) (suspenseful music) - We're gonna need more time. - I know. - How 'bout I buy us some time? - You sure? - The bullets won't kill it, but it'll slow it down. - Let's go. (suspenseful music) This is not a good plan. We're playing on that thing's home field. - Don't worry. - You forgot I've already seen you shoot. - I'm improving with practice. - I bet you say that to all the cheerleaders. - I do. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - This is in a direct line with the warehouse. It'll come through here. - You know, if we get out of here, I'm thinking of becoming a soldier of fortune. - Terrific. - No, no, no, really. I'd be good at it. Look over there. This would be a good spot to set up an ambush. - That building looks like it's in really bad shape. We step inside there it'll fall apart. - Wanna bet? - You're on. (dramatic music) (thunder rumbles) (dramatic music) - I'm gonna break the window. - Your call. We gotta get on the roof. (dramatic music) - There's gotta be a stairway in here. Hold my gun. Watch my back. (dramatic music) (glass shatters) (dramatic music) - Spivak! (screaming) I can't see. Spivak, Spivak, I can't, come on! (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Time elapsed, 14 keylars, three kills, three targets remaining. (robot buzzing) (thunder rumbles) - All right, get it up. Easy, easy, okay. (dramatic music) - Cool. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's set up the trip wire over here. (rain falling) (thunder rumbles) You got it? (dramatic music) - Someone's coming, get down. Carrie, wait! (screaming) Hang on! - [Carrie] Help me, Ben! Help me! - Hang on. Come on, lean. - I can't. (dramatic music) - Well, at least we know the trip wire works. Where's Spivak? - Dead. - Where's the alien? - Behind me. - All right, look, everything's set up. We can hide behind those air conditioners, okay, let's go. - Too late. - Oh god. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Quick, let's go, get the gun, let's go, come on. Watch the wire. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Where's the lighter? - Spivak had it. - What? - [Carrie] No! (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (screams) - Get him. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (guns firing) (dramatic music) (glass shatters) - It's running, it's running. (gun fires) (dramatic music) - It's on fire, come on. (dramatic music) (explosion) (dramatic music) - So what are we doing hanging around? Let's go. - I don't trust it. - You don't have to trust it, it's dead. - That's what we thought before. - Forget it, we won okay. - Pichel. (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) - I'm gonna chop that thing to pieces. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - No! (suspenseful music) (grunting) (suspenseful music) - I can't cut through this stuff. It's as hard as a rock. (dramatic music) It's glowing. - I think it's healing itself. - How long do you think that'll take? Four or five minutes. - I don't know but we don't wanna be here. - Let's get out of here. - Come on. (suspenseful music) - It's going to be morning soon. - Like we're gonna see it. - We can't give up now. There's gotta be a way to kill that thing. (robot buzzing) - Did you see that thing? We can't kill it. - That sound. - Time elapsed, 16 keylars. Regeneration in process. - We're dead. We are so dead. That thing can kill us anytime it wants. - What if we just don't move. - The creature is equipped with heat seeking sensors, while it may be distracted by a overload of senses, your lack of movement will only expedite the inevitable. - Who the hell are you? You're not Cooper. - The Cooper entity and I are cohabitating the same humanoid form. - Cooper, who the hell have we been talking to? - I'm an alien entity. But I'm here to ensure your survival. - How? You've done a hell of a job so far. - Well, maybe for the sake of our survival, you better tell us what the hell is going on here, huh? - The creature comes from the species of things have hunting subhuman things as a sport, but it came to our world, we imprisoned it. - How did it get here? - The alien escape, stole a space craft, and entered orbit. I am to terminate the creature in any way possible. - Well don't you think you'd better get your ass in gear? I mean, we're dying here, man. - I understand. This creature is not like our species. It has adapted much more quickly to your world. Also, chemical impurities from its body have prohibited me from functioning at full capacity. - Wound regenerated, resume game. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (gun cocks) (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Listen, Cooper, I don't know, whoever you are, how do we kill this thing? - There is no way. Or, forming approaching north west. Danger, danger. D A eight. (suspenseful music) - [Robot] Targets in range. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (gun fires) - Cooper! (gun cocks) (robot buzzing) - We gotta get out of here! - Cooper! (robot buzzing) (suspenseful music) - Get the wooden pipe. We need it for leverage. - Carrie, we've got an ax. - Okay. (grunting) (suspenseful music) - Go, go. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) - Time elapsed, 16 keylars. Wound none, four killed. Two targets remaining, resume game. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (thunder rumbles) (suspenseful music) - We've gotta find a roof, we gotta jump. - It's too far away. - We're dead. - Stop saying that. - Get down. (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Damn! - What you're out of bullets. Pichel, look, it's Cooper. Cooper! (suspenseful music) (robot buzzing) (grunting) - Carrie! (suspenseful music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - I thought you were dead. - I think I am. - What are you talking about? - The Cooper entity is no longer capable of maintaining his own life functions. Without my presence this host organism will perish. - Cooper is dead. - Yes. According to your technology. However, on my world, we have the ability to repair this physical form. The choice is his. (dramatic music) - Coop? (dramatic music) - If I stay here, I'm dead. (dramatic music) What a trip, man. Pitch, I gotta go. - Wait, can you ever come back? - One day, perhaps, he may return. - How do we finally kill that thing? - The amulet on the alien's neck functioned as a life force regeneration system. When you destroyed it, it could no longer continue. - Are there any more of those things? - Yes. But it is unlikely that you will encounter them again. They rarely hunt in this sector, as their home world is many light years away. Now, we must leave. - Cooper. (dramatic music) - Thanks for taking care of me. Tell my mom that I love her, and I'll see her again someday. - Call me when you get back. - Yeah. (dramatic music) You've been a good friend, man. I'll see you, buddy. - You better. (dramatic music) (buzzing) (dramatic music) - See ya, Coop. (humming) (dramatic music) - Time elapsed, 19 keylars. Wound fatal. Game over. Take my goals, take away. - Game over. (dramatic music) (robot buzzing) (spaceship lands) (dramatic music)
