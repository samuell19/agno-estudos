Hey, I bought him that. Yeah, I like it. Crystal: Old man don't smoke anymore. - I got him to quit. - Did you? Yeah, I posted photos of rotten cancer-infested lungs all over the house. [clatters] - Oh! - Sorry! Oh, maybe one night, we don't fucking drink so much, huh? Come on, Frank, it's Christmas. - You see how wound up he is? - Hm-hm. Could you may be like take him out, help him meet somebody or something? - Like what, for his penis? - Take it easy. All he ever wants to do is be here or at his shop. Crystal: Hm. - It's true. Because every time I go to a bar with you two, you get wasted and fucking start shit. And thus, you never meet anybody. As far as meeting somebody though, you did mean like a female, right? Crystal: Swaino, you know who you are? You're the guy who makes one too many gay jokes. [all laughing] [laughing] You know what? I got nothing but love for you tonight, Swaino.

Los Angeles could be a dangerous place, trust me. You got to keep your head on a swivel. You ain't been on a fucking airplane. - Not the point here. - Alright, you're right. So, if a guy comes at you with a knife, you just pivot your wrist like this. Oh! - Okay! Sorry, sorry, sorry. - You've got to try to stab me. Well, an attacker's not going to tell you he's gonna stab you. I'm just putting that out there. You're right, but let's do it. You're right, I'm wrong. So, then, you pivot the wrist like that... - Yes. - Like that. [groans] I'm not-- I'm not playing anymore. [laughing] - Are you okay? - Just do it, man. Yeah.

We got into an argument and he punched a hole in the wall. Well, at least, at least he didn't beat you. Hey, Swaino, can I wear brown boots with a black jacket? Hmm... Depends on the boots. I gotta see the boots. Why are you asking him? Once I start buying my clothes from a fucking garbage can, I'll ask you. Thank you, Sensei. - You're a fucking-- - Hey, so listen to me...

Let me, let me get a drink, Let me get a drink. Hey, hey, big fucking love, right? To family. And who do I see across the bar? It's fucking Afnahn, she's there, she's making eyes at me. So, I'm like, hey, it's time to fucking get to work, right? I walk over, I'm like, hello? Hello, this is unbelievable. How are you? And this fucking chick, she pretends that she doesn't remember me. Do I know you? Yeah. She gives me like this fake name. - I'm Judy. - So I'm like, fuck it. I give her a fake name. Fuck it, I'm Eddie, right? Hello? Hello, Judy. - Hi, Eddie. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. - Wow, it is nice to meet you. And then I realize what this tricky girl is up to. She's playing like one of these fucking sex games. Right? I have to be honest with you. It's fucking turning me on, right? So I make up this whole fake backstory, right? I'm-- I'm like from fucking Connecticut. I'm from fucking Connecticut. Yeah. I like rowing. [laughs] She's eating it up. We hang out, we're getting hammered. We go back to her place, and, oh, my God, oh, my God. The fucking performance, there's something about being a character. I'm the fucking heavyweight champ, right? She passes out, I fucking pass out, great night, right? I wake up the next morning and I'm a mess. I'm hungover as shit. And I take a look at her in the morning light. I can get you a car, show you where the bus stop is. I can give you a ride, whatever works for you. Is, um, is that my shirt? Swaino: And I look. It finally fucking dawns on me-- It's a different girl. Right? Hey, how did you know that? Afnahn, she-- she got engaged. Me and her, we follow each other on Insta. That is some vintage fucking Terrance Swaino shit right there. Ah, here we go, here we go. You got to fucking judge me, Frank. When's the last time you went on a fucking date, huh? Matter of fact... Oh, shit, I... - What do you mean, hold on. - I'll tell you the story. Tell us the story, who is it? It's, uh, it's Crystal. Tell her we said hello. Let me talk to her. This could take two seconds, keep an eye on the meat. Keep an eye on the meat. I've got to keep an eye on the meat. Hey, Packie, my eye's on the meat. Chad on phone: It's just not worth the amount we're talking about. Hey, hey, look, I totally get it, man. - Let's just double it. Chad: Double it? Are you serious, okay? ♪ I'm hanging with my man Packie ♪ ♪ Who looks like an owl ♪ ♪ You know my man Packie got a dick like a yard ♪ Chad: I'll hit you up when I'm on the road. Alright, man, thanks. [indistinct singing] [sighs] Let me ask you something, man. All this fucking Instagram shit, you know. I don't know, maybe you can like, show me how that shit works. Everybody's getting laid that way these days. Are you? Who, me? [laughs] Let me see your phone. Hey, give me your phone. You just, you take a pic. - Hang on, hang on, hang on. - Hm-hm? Yeah. [camera shutter clicks] And then, you just, you open your Instagram app. Where's your app? You don't have any apps. Fucking stop with the apps. There it is, good. Then... you pick a cool filter. Sepia makes it look artsy, right? Fuck, I didn't know you could do that. And then you go here and you press this. You go there and you press that. Is there like a filter you can use to get the tiny homo out of the picture or just... I can tell you think it's cool, Swaino. Then I tag the location. So everybody knows we're at Frank's shop together, right? ♪ Shop together ♪ ♪ Shop together ♪ [cellphone ringing] Who the fuck is this? Karen Delgado's calling you. Why the fuck is Karen calling you? Hey, give me my fucking phone back, Packie. - Is Karen back in town? - Just give me... Yeah, she's back in town, just give me the phone. Packie: Are you banging Karen? Why would you fucking... What's the matter with you? Why would she fucking, why would she fucking call you? Swaino: Just fucking stop. We had coffee. [clamoring] - How's the meat? - It's good. Packie: It's good. Swaino: Yeah. - It's good. - Yeah. Frank: Two more minutes. - Good. Thirty-five years old, divorcee from Derry, she's got this four-year-old son. So, we go on this date and... Still is fucking depressing. She had wicked big tits. Go on, sir. Frank: So, we end up back at her place. Dottie: Thanks for the dinner. Frank: It's like maybe our third date. There you are, thanks very much. ♪ At your worst you still believe ♪ ♪ It's worth the fight ♪ - You want to come inside? - Yeah. I go inside, she pays the babysitter. - How'd he do? - You know? Punched me in the face a couple of times. You want me to walk you home? It's just next door. The sitter goes home and then we go into her bedroom. You're a tall drink of water. ♪ Shut up kiss me hold me tight ♪ Oh, shit. - Sorry. - It's okay. She tells me she has not been with a guy since her kid was born. So she's all over me. ♪ Stop pretending I'm not there ♪ ♪ When it's clear I'm not going anywhere ♪♪ She takes my hand and she pushes it into her pants. She, I shit you not, has got a huge, unkempt, like 1970's Playboy bush. [laughs] - My watch gets stuck there. - Oh, stop kidding. Oh, relax, let's be careful. - Oh. - Just... - Just easy. - Oh, my God. - It's your watch. Yeah. - Here you go. Hold on. Sorry. So I pulled my hand out. She goes, "I'm really embarrassed, Frank." I was gonna trim. No, it's okay, it's fine. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. We just start laughing, fucking laughing our asses off. Was kind of fun. We're just laughing. But it was so loud that we wake up the kid. Boy 1 on radio: Momma, mommy, come and get me, I'm scared. So she gets off the bed and she says... I'll be right back, I just have to put him to sleep. Totally, go. Being a single parent, it ain't easy. So, she says, hey... Still want to fuck? Yeah, I'd love to. Of course, I still want to fuck. Yeah. Oh, good, I'm looking forward to it. So then she leaves and I'm lying there, in her bed, for, like, half an hour. My hard on is a distant fucking memory at this point. So I get up and I go down the hallway... [instrumental music] and I see she's lying there on this, like, race car bed... asleep with her son. [mellow music] So I watched for a couple of minutes. It was kind of a sweet image, you know. A mom like that with a kid like that... is the way everything should be. So... I let myself out, I go home... and I watched TV. Never heard from her again. You ever consider killing yourself? That's a beautiful story, Frank. Tragic, but beautiful. The fuck is so beautiful about it? Frank doesn't think he can be of value in a relationship unless they're broken and he could fix them. Like Karen, she's in pieces, right? She's Humpty Dumpty, always need something to be fixing. This woman, she had her life together, Frank didn't know what to do with her, so he, he just let himself out. Are you done, can we eat? Hm? Eat your food. Frank, Karen's back in town. - How did you know that? - So you knew? She's the mother of my child, you don't think I'd know she's in fuckin' Manch-Vegas? Yeah. - You seen her? - Why does it matter? Fucking cycle begins. Enough. Well, I'm sorry, are we supposed to be happy that Karen is back in town? Gee, I can't wait to deal with your anger issues again. You know, you don't got to deal with shit anymore because you got your new fucking work friends, right? God, ah, for fuck's sake, don't do that. Look, all I'm saying is Karen's fucking toxic. It's what she does. Swoops in, she plays the wife, she plays the mother, she pulls you in, and then she tears you the fuck apart. And you go on a bender, start throwing strangers she flirts with through plate-glass fucking windows, and I get to stay up with Crystal all night. Tell her her father ain't going back to jail. This is shit you know, even Crystal knows it, alright? There are two things in your life that consistently fuck you up, it's Karen, and it's your fucking temper. I mean, think about it, you-- you live your life, you've got a daughter who spends half the fucking time being terrified of you. That's just a fact. [clattering] At least I accepted responsibility for raising my kid instead of sticking my diseased cock in a bunch of half-dumb fucking girls. [panting] What are you gonna do, Frank, you want to hit me? You want to hit me just because I told you the truth? Fuck it, I love you. And I hate what she does to you. I hate fucking watching it. So, yeah, I fucking hate her. Alright, I hate what she fucking does to you. So if I fucking said something that makes you want to fucking bash my fucking skull in then just fucking do it, Frank. I'm just, I'm just fucking being honest with you. So, go ahead. I'm right fucking here. At least I know I said my piece, I'm here. [cellphone rings] Hey, Frank, it could be Crystal again. Maybe you want to get that. - I can get it. - No, no, no, no. I'll get it. Hey, what's up? It's Frank. Yeah, you just, you just keep going on 93 North for a while and then you, you'll take the Mammoth Road exit, just gonna go like four miles, you know, it'll bring you around and, you know, you'll see my shop kind of tucked away there on the left and see, it's the only place that has light on. Alright, man. Yeah. Well, I'll see you soon. [cellphone beeps] [sniffles] Hey. I'm sorry. For what? For calling your cock diseased. [laughs] I'm sorry. By the way, I mean, just, I don't know, with that, you know, I did take a needle for that situation. So I just, I don't know, just kind of feel like if you are going to make fun of my cock, you, like refer to it as like as a formerly diseased cock, I'm just saying you should do that. Deal. - Alright. - Alright, Frank. Let me clean this shit up. Who's coming over, Frank? - Oh, this kid. - What kid? He's from Northeastern, played pickup basketball with him a few times. [indistinct chatter] He's coming by. Why the fuck would you have him come over here, for what? I'm buying Molly off of him. - Nice flip phone. - Yeah. That's my work phone. - Catch you up later. Alright. - Alright. [ball thudding] - Since when you do Molly? - I don't. I figured I'd try it tonight with you guys. And then what? We have a fucking dance with each other in your lawnmower shop. We ain't seen each other in a long time. And I wanted tonight to be special. Come on, what's the big deal? Come on, Swaino, don't be a pussy. Ah, I'm fine, fuck it, why the fuck not? Why the fuck not? Look, if we're gonna party, I'm gonna fucking spark up. Anybody else? Is there still an Old Lady in that closet? [instrumental music] Hey, you know what? Give me fucking hit off the Old Lady. - Hey, alright. - Huh, man. I like this new, out-of-control Frank, it's been a long time since you let your hair down. Let your hair down? Yeah, it means like relax. [laughs] We know what it means, but who without a vagina actually fucking says that? [music continues] What? I think you forgot. I think Frank forgot how to do it. Dude, I fuckin'... [laughing] I'll tell you what, that's fucking precision crafting right there. - Oh, fuck. - Fuck! - What're you doing with that? - This is... One, two, three. [music continues] [Swaino groaning] Swaino: My fucking secret to youth, beyond all else, I only fucking fuck pussy 26 years old or younger. Frank: A woman doesn't know how to make love until she's 30 years old. Swaino: I can prefer a girl who doesn't know how to fuck. - I like that. - So she won't be disappointed. Swaino: That's fine, look, women have fucking sexual issues, right? And what they do is they bring that with them into the fucking bedroom. They have bad fucking experiences, right? So I wanna be there in the beginning. You want to be the bad experience. What the fuck is that? Jesus fucking Christ! Three months ago at my cousin's bachelor party, uh, this stripper, she put a pinky finger right in my ass. [laughs] Are you laughing at me or with me? What? I thought we was all sharing. Just trust us, fucking trust us. It's fine, we'll clear the fire. - No, you know how to land. - No, listen to me. Just bend your knees, bend your knees, here we go. Let's give it a good one. - One, two... - Good fucking throw, Frankie. - Come on, come on - And three.

Frank: Fuck you. I'll leave that up to you. What's up, man? - What's up, man? - Good to you see, man. Really appreciate you coming on all this way. Yeah, no, it's cool. I really do, it means a lot. Hey, come on over here. Meet my boys. This is Packie and this is Swaino. - Hey. - Guys, this is Chad Walker. You should see this fucking kid play basketball, man. So should we, uh, deal with the... - Do you mean this? - Yeah. Wow. Just like out in the open like that, huh. What do you mean? It's Frank's first big drug deal, I think he thought there would be like code words or some shit, you know? I'll get your money. Hold on to them. Swaino: How much you wanna bet Franky's got the money like in a Manila envelope. Yeah, like a, like a rubber, rubber band wrapped around it. [laughs] You guys live here? We've got a bunk bed. How much you bench press, Chad? I don't use free weights, it slows you down. I'm training with plyometrics and Pilates right now. How tall are you? Six-three, six-four. - One or the other. Chad: Somewhere in between. - Got it. - You got nice eyes. - Polo, huh? Chad: Yeah, like Ralph Lauren. Ralph Lauren. Oh, yeah, I got it. I like how the scarf kind of hides that, huh? I mean, you don't wanna fuckin' just throw it out there for people, right? What kind of car do you drive? - Ah, G-wagon. - How much is it? I don't know, my dad got it for me as a gift. I don't-- - Can I drive it? - No. Oh, hey, you guys gonna give me a hit of that thing? Oh, you don't have to ask us twice. Chad: Alright. So is that like your first time you ever took PCP? Hey, Chad, why don't you come on inside, have a real man's drink? That'll show you. Alright, Chad, this is some good shit, you are in for a treat. Oh, God, that is good. Ah. It tastes like shit. You, my friend, are what a doctor would refer to as Uncle Gary. That's for you. Manila envelope. So why is it so important for old dudes to like scotch? In ten years, I'm gonna ask you the same question, you know what you're gonna say? What? You know, I started out thinking I could come up with something wicked funny, but it just never liked gelled. Hey, Frank, this is only half. Oh, shit, that's right, I'm sorry. Ah, let me get the rest of your money. [camera shutter clicking] Packie: Hey, what kind of filter you got on there? - Nashville. Packie: I like Perpetua. Let me ask you. Did you tag Frank's shop? Chad: Yeah, I tagged him. Packie: Yeah. We did too. Chad: When you guys were my age, it was like... no internet. No, it was fucking crazy. We did this thing, it was called going outside. Right, man. How about you, Mr. Fucking Big Time Drug Dealer, huh? You, uh, you carry the cabbage? Yeah, yeah, I got you. What the fuck is that? It's a fucking mason jar. Yeah, it's called white champagne. Genius, let's see what you're fucking packing, huh? You know what, speaking of scotch, you guys remember the night at the game six? This fucking story again. The Buckner game? That's right, 1986. Sox gave New England something they hadn't had in a long time, hope. What is this, a fucking Ken Burns documentary? I got it on YouTube. Sox lead the series going in. Me, Frank and Swaino, we're at Frankie's basement, watching on this shitty little black and white with aluminum foil on the antenna. [instrumental music] Man on TV: Nearly home here. Let's see what Clemens comes back with. Packie: It was our own little club house. Nobody ever caught us down there. [laughs] Very good. Ow. Fucking old men, they're upstairs watching the same game on a fucking color TV. Our fathers spent their lives watching the Sox lose. They used to get wicked fucking hammered during the games. We knew we need to leave them alone. [men clamoring] [laughs] It was unbelievable, because this is the night the curse of the fucking Bambino was about to be fucking broken. Then something historic happens. Hey, fuckheads, histories happening, get your asses upstairs. Let's go. They never asked us up there before, we're all like, "What!" Come on, sit right here, right next to your old man. And we're all sitting there, fucking just like this. Right. We never felt love from our fucking fathers before in our whole fucking lives, right? Hey, now, hey, keep your eyes on this game, this is fricking history here, okay? Packie: This was it. The Sox were going to win the World Series and we were all gonna be in the room together. Mookie Wilson gets a slow roller right up the first baseline. Bill Buckner squares up, drops his glove and the fucking ball rolls right between his goddamn legs. One of the worst errors in baseball history. The Mets score. Fuck. Jesus. Packie: But it doesn't end there for us. We find ourselves in a den of fucking lions. The problem is, we had to walk through the kitchen to get through the back door and Frank's old man, he was standing right there. Now, let me tell you something. We ain't never seen a grown man cry before. It was terrifying. Frank's pop... Anthony: What the fuck are you doing here? Packie: Grabs him, slams him up against the fridge. This ain't like your generation of millennials. This is when you got fucking slapped. I told you to stay downstairs. What did I say? Packie: So what did Swaino do? - Stop! Packie: Grabs Frank's pop's arm, tries to get him to stop. Now, this type of kid-on-adult attack was unprecedented in our world, and highly ineffective since Swaino was like all of a bony ten-year-old. Swaino's old man, he runs in, throws Swaino off. So I'm standing there watching my two best friends get demolished by their fathers and there's my old man. I looked at him, he looked at me, then he shrugged, reaches out, guess he figured he should get on the kid beating business too. So I did the only thing I could do. Swaino: Fled, like a fucking streak of midget lightning, he bolts like a bitch out the front door. But not before I grabbed a bottle of scotch. Except the screen door was fucking locked. Well, finally, Packie just burst through the motherfucker, right? He got the fucking screen wrapped around his fucking head, and everybody's just stops to look at him across the fucking lawn. And me and, me and Swaino, we use that moment as a diversion to get the fuck out of the house. And then we all met in the fucking woods by that big rock where we'd go. Just a big fucking rock in the woods. 'Cause that's all it fucking took back then. We passed around that fucking bottle. It was the first time any of us ever had scotch. And you wanna know something, Chad? It tasted like shit. - Oh-ho-ho! - Didn't it, boys? - Didn't it, boys? - Ohh! Ohh! You fucking motherfucker, you motherfucker. So fucking beautiful. It was so fucking beautiful. [cellphone buzzing] Fucking genius. He's the person. Hey, uh, hey, guys look, I gotta take this real quick. Ah, hey, Chad, you can hang out for a bit, right? No, I can hang for a few. Hey, boys, entertain, uh, entertain our guest, please. Hey, Chad, what does your father do? He's partners at Landon and Wilkins. What the fuck is that? It's like the biggest fucking law firm in Boston. So, what's that like, having a father you're not ashamed of? Good, I guess. Fucking call me Karen. Fuck. Swaino: Hey, you... That's why you've been stuck for three years in a row. You don't gotta be like a fucking shot at point guard, you know what I mean? I'll tell you what I wanna know about, Chad. How about that Northeastern pussy? Being on the crew team plus in the fraternity definitely has its benefits. You got nice eyes too, don't discount that. That's what I thought. Well, you know, you don't need any of that shit these days to get laid. Getting pussy, man, it's all through social media. I've been trying to tell him that. It's, how's that fucking work, what do you do? You send fucking pictures of your cock and shit? That's not a good idea. Whatever you put out there, that shit's gonna haunt you, dude. How so? I saw like a couple of days ago, my dad had to fire a junior attorney because of a pic. I mean, the guy was at a gay resort in Los Cabos, wearing a Speedo, fucking tongue kissing some Mexican dude. Wait, a lawyer can't be gay? What, you know my Aunt Connie is a lesbian. She rides a Triumph, grows her own weed. Oh, yeah, no dude, that's-- that's nice and all. We can be all politically correct. But the dudes running this country, like my dad and his clients, man, their mindset is back in 1955. My dad has a bunch of billionaire clients who don't want to pay some fucking faggot in a Speedo $2,200 an hour for legal advice. What kind of lawyer makes $2,200 an hour? The good ones. - Hello? - Finally, you dumb fuck. Fucking where the fuck are you? I'm about to call the police. Just calm down. Sorry, I've been busy. - Are you fucking serious? Frank: Calm down. Frank: Where are you? - I'm in the house. Frank: In my house? How the fuck did you get in? I jimmied the fucking door, how'd you expect me to get in? Where the fuck is Crystal? Crystal doesn't wanna talk to you right now. Alright? She's moving to fuckin' California. - What'd you say to her? - Stop, please. I'm working really hard here, Frank. I'm trying to change. Don't fuck this up for me. Fucking tell me... Fuck. Gotta be fucking careful, bro. You can't put that stuff out. Here we go. Bob Keats, motherfucker. What, you don't fucking believe me? Boy, fucking take him, gotta be careful. Oh, no, no, no. I got a, I got a fucking story for you. So a few months ago, I find this chick on Instagram. She's-- she's really young and really cute. And I DM and I ask her to come to a fraternity party. What the fuck is DM? - Direct message. Chad: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So she shows up, I get her totally fucking hammered. I'm trying to shove my dick in her mouth, but she ends up being like a total fucking cock tease, alright? She gives me one of those like half-ass, like falling asleep hand jobs, and I'm like, wake the fuck up, you know? Like it doesn't matter, man. A waste of a goddamn night, you know. I totally forget about it, it doesn't fucking matter, right? But she's still into me and she-- she's sending me pics. - Naked pictures? Chad: No, no, no. Well, not at first, tame at first, you know? So I coaxed her. I worked her and she sent 'em. But-- but that's not the weird thing, right? The... Here, hold on. Um, she's got this condition. - Her, her nipples are like... - Holy fuck. Chad: Her nipples are fucking gigantic. Goddamn it, that's a big fuck again... - Look at that! - I've seen bigger. I'm not, I'm kind of worried this chick has a medical condition, so I'm showing some of my buds. Sure, you gotta get their opinion. Chad: Exactly, yeah, yeah. These big nip pics, I mean, they're like, oh, my God, they're striking a chord with the boys, and so I'm getting her to send me more. Like send all kinds of fucking pictures to me, man. And I'm sending them like to everyone in the house and they're sending them to everyone. So we call that going viral. Thank you for the clarification, Professor Cuntface. So, Pancake shows up to another one of our fraternity parties. - Pancake, who's Pancake? - Pancake. That's what I nicknamed her. 'Cause of the size of... Yeah, yeah, you get it. Ah, that is so fucking fucked up. I know, I know. Yeah, so she shows up and she's like famous now, right? Like she's a fucking star. We all know her, here she comes. Yeah, yeah. And these drunk dudes, they, uh, they start chanting, "Pancake, Pancake, Pancake." - Oh, fuck. - Everyone joins in, everyone. Like fuck, she joined in. She didn't know what was going on. She's like, "Pancake, Pancake, Pancake. Pancake, Pancake." It was fucking terrible. But she, but she finds out, she finds out why and she fucking storms out of the house, just devastated, man. Yeah, young girls, everything's the end of the fucking world. Everything's the end of the fucking world, yeah. She goes back to her home, takes a bottle of pills... - Tries to fucking kill herself. - Jesus. That fucking took a turn for the dark. Chad: Whoa! - What, whoa? - I mean, she okay or... - I don't know. My dad told me not to get involved. I can't get caught up in that shit. I mean, I feel bad, but... it's like my dad says, you can't... She shouldn't have sent the pics to begin with. Frank: Hey, guys, it's fucking cold out there. Come on in. That's my whole fucking point. Gotta be fucking careful. Internet's forever, bro. [cans clanking] - I-- I got to split. - Oh, no, come on. - Do one shot with me. - Listen, I'm late, I'm late. Look, one shot, you'll be on your merry way. A little baby shot. - Alright. - Yeah. One shot. One for the road. Actually, I'm done partying. - No, I'm kidding. - Ahh... [laughing] Frank almost had a fucking heart attack. I mean, he's actually... For you. Chad: Alright. - Oh, take a big one. - Thank you. Yeah. Like etiquette... - Cheers. - Cheers. - Hey, hey, hey. - Hey, hey. - Cheers. - Alright, alright, alright. Hey. [sniffling] Hey. Hey. What were you talking about out there? [laughs] Maybe jokin' about something. Was it like funny? You was laughin'. [keys jangling] - Hey, g-- give me my keys back. - Oh, no, no. I'll get you... You're not getting these, you're not getting these, you're not getting these until you tell me what you guys were, were laughin' at. Maybe just show him the Pancake pic, I don't know. A picture? Packie: It was a stupid story, Frank. Frank, give the fucking kid his keys back. I want to see his picture. Frank, it's a stupid fucking story. No, no, just-- Hey, Frank, take it easy, man. You take it fuckin' easy. Show me the fuckin' picture. - What do I do here? - Hey, Frank! What are you fucking doing? Show me the fucking picture right now. [intense music] Swaino and Karen had coffee. Oh, for Christ's sake! Fucking idiot! My Karen? - Yeah. - And-- What do you mean "and?" Yeah, we-- we-- we fucking had coffee. Did you fuck her? How could you fucking ask me that? No, fuck you for asking me that. - Fuck you, Frank. - Okay so, why did you meet? She took a fuckin' red eye, alright? She couldn't fucking find you in your shop or in your, or in your house. So, she came to my work, she freaked out 'cause she's fucking Karen. What did you tell her? I told her that I could fuckin' care less if she's fuckin' sober now. And that she said that all she wanted was to see her daughter. It's her fuckin' daughter. Oh, by the way, Frank's got a daughter. You still think he's cool? Fuck. I'm lookin' out for you and Crystal. That's all I'm fuckin' doing, it's all I'm ever fucking doing. Cr-- Crystal? [grunting] Oh, oh! Jeez, you just killed Chad Walker with a wrench, Frank. What the fuck did you do that for? He's not dead. Hey, Frankie, I'm gonna ask you again. What the fuck are you doin'? That story that he was telling you about... it's Crystal. [dramatic music] [camera shutter clicking] That fucking picture that he-- he-- he showed us, that was Crystal? Is she gonna be okay, Frank? It's been two weeks... and she hasn't woken up yet. We don't know the extent of the brain damage. It's different every day. [mellow music] When she came to me... when she needed me the most... Just... [crying] Frank: What the fuck were you thinking? He said they were just for him. You're supposed to be smarter than that, Crystal. [crying] Dad, please. You are gonna turn out to be just like your fuckin' mother. [crying] Fuck! I didn't know... I don't fuckin' understand this. Pictures were online. [sniffling] Everybody in her high school passing them around. Everybody making fun of her. Even her best friends, relentless. So she had enough. [knocking on door] Frank: Hey, hon, I'm comin' in. [door opens] Crystal! Crystal! Crystal! Baby. What did you do? [music continues] His fuckin' father. His fucking father is connected. He made it all go away. I mean, Crystal is just the poor girl from Manch-Vegas. Nobody fucking cares. Nobody but us. So, what are we gonna do? I'm gonna kill him. I'll pull the trigger. That's on me. But I needed you two here with me. There's a lot of work with the disposal. The disposal? Yeah. I planned it all out. I prepped the room. [chair scraping on floor] [intense music] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [intense music] [mechanical whirring] [music continues] [grunting] [clanking] [machine whirring] [music continues] [fire crackling] That's your fucking plan? - Yes. - What about the G-Wagon? We drive it to Hyde Park, smash the window, put some of his blood on the front seat. Come on. It's not the first time that a drug deal went bad in that fucking town. The kid's fucking, he-- he's 19 years old. Pe-- people ain't gonna fuckin' give up on a kid like that. - He's a fucking drug dealer! - Come on. He's a very casual fucking drug dealer. The kid ain't fucking Scarface here. I mean, just... You called him on your phone, right? - It was a burner. - What the fuck... What the fuck is a burner? You don't watch "The Wire?" You took the fucking Molly, didn't you? Frank. Frankie, I just... I-- I-- I think that we need to think here. I think that we're just, we're going too fucking fast. He ruined Crystal's life over a fuckin' joke. Okay? Our Crystal. That's all that we should be thinkin' about right now. When you're right, you're right. I'm in, Frank. I'm in. [dramatic music] Yeah, alright. Give me a hand. [grunting] Fuck, this is fucking crazy, Frank. This is fucking crazy. I... Could you guys just fucking stop for one fucking second? Frankie, how are we gonna fuckin' get out of this? You didn't fucking think about it. Wait, where are you... Pack? Fuck! You're fucking outta your mind. Swaino, if you wanna go, now's the time to go. Yeah, like it's that fucking easy, Frank. I never fucking said it was easy. What am I supposed to do? I'm an accomplice, huh? I'm here. - What am I supposed to do? - Guys, Chad Walker's awake. [muffled groaning] You wanna say something? [muffled grunting] Please, please don't do this. Please... Your ass is definitely not talking out of this shit, Chad. Swaino, Swaino, help me, please. No, no, I'm not, I'm not a part of this, okay? I'm not a part of it. Wait, just let me, let me, let me say something, please. What? [crying] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I made a mistake, I'm just a kid. My parents, and the internet, the fucking internet. I-- I know I hurt her. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it. I've been workin' in this shop almost every day for over ten fuckin' years, trying to give my daughter a future. But then you came along. And you treat her like a... You treated her like a piece of garbage. I didn't know she was in high school. Hey, was it funny passing around that picture of my-- my little baby girl, huh? Huh? Bet you all got a big fucking laugh, right? I'm sorry! I'm sorry. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. No, no. Please. [crying] No, no, no. Please, no. No, no. No, please. Please, no. No, please, please. [crying] Oh! No, no. - No, please, don't kill me. - Oh, God. Chad: Let me say goodbye to my mom and dad, please. Let me say goodbye to them. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no! No! [crying] Wait. Instagram! Instagram! Wait, wait, wait, wait. What the fuck? He posted on Instagram. - We all did, Frankie. - Man, what the fuck! [all clamoring] He fuckin' posted on-- on-- on the internet. It's gone out into, like, the fucking world. Yeah, we all did. Oh, this is unbelievable. All a cop's gotta do is look on his fucking Instagram and he knows that he's here. - Swaino's right. - And we are all fucked. I have 2,854 followers. Hey, you shut the fuck up! You're so fucked. Oh, my God, I'll tell you what you're gonna do. - You're gonna untie me. - Shut up. - And I'm gonna call the cops. Swaino: Shut up! - Attempted murder. - Shut up! Oh, my father's gonna sue the shit out of you. You guys are gonna get, get fucking ass-raped in jail. Get ready, boys! Start stretching those fucking assholes. Shut the fuck up! You should've taught your whore fucking daughter not to... Hey, hey! Frankie, no! Frankie, no! [chocking] No, don't! No! No, Frankie. Fuck. [dog barking] Frankie, listen carefully. Help, fucking help! Shut the fuck up! - You alright, man? - Yeah. I'll go, I'll go. [dog barking] [knock on door] Karen: I can see you right there, Swaino, you fuckin' chimpanzee! Open the fucking door. Karen, you better get the fuck outta here. Karen: What the fuck is going on, Frank? I swear I'll throw my fist through the fucking window. - Karen, just go-- Karen: Alright, I'm kicking. Alright, alright, alright, alright, get in. What is going on? Jeez, why the blood all over you? What is this, a fight club or something? You guys finally fucking each other? What the fuck are you doing here? I went on Instagram, I saw this jackass checked in here. If you think that you can keep my daughter away from me, I swear to God, I'll get a lawyer. - I'll get a fucking lawyer. - Calm the fuck down. Okay. You told him that we talked this morning, right? And you asked if we-- we-- we fucked, right? - Do you think I would do that? - Listen-- Do you think I'm that kind of a fucking person? Would you please just stop fucking talking? - Shut the fuck up, Swaino. - Okay. - Karen-- - Where the fuck is my kid? Where the fuck is my fucking kid? Something happened to Crystal. What? - I need, I need-- - What? - What the fuck happened? - I need you to calm-- Tell me what fuckin' happened, Frank. Sit the fuck down, please. [mellow music] [inaudible dialogue] I fucked up. I-- I... [indistinct chatter] I need you to get in your car and get the fuck out of here. Just go away... right now. Where the fuck is he? [music continues] [dramatic music] [grunting] [muffled grunting] [grunting] [muffled sobbing] Just, just... [Karen sobs] So, what are we gonna do? I'm gonna cop a plea. And turn myself in. Tell 'em you guys had nothin' to do with this. What? Now, listen. Give me a half-hour head start before you let him go. Okay? I gotta say goodbye to her, before I turn myself in. You can count on us, Frankie. I'm sorry. Alright. [sniffles] You gotta take care of her now, Karen. Swaino: Wait, what? Hang on, Frank. - She's her mother. - I'm gonna be here. - She's her mother. - It doesn't matter. What's she gonna do? She's gonna run off again. I promise you. You gotta trust me. - Frankie, you gotta be kidding. - You got to fucking trust me. Swaino: Fuck her and the fucking horse she walked in on. It's not about growing the fuck up. I've been there... Alright, just stop it, just stop it! Goddamn it, enough! You're just gonna give up? The fuck we supposed to do, Karen? I don't know! I don't know. But on top of everything else that piece of shit did to her, he's gonna take her father away from her, too? Crystal needs her father. She needs you. Frank: Karen. If they stay... you're all going to jail. You're saying we can't outsmart some soft fuckin' pretty boy? You don't understand who his father is. Fuck his fuckin' father! Fuck his entire fuckin' family! He ain't gonna win this time, not today. Guys, we've gotta be smart. We've gotta use our fuckin' heads. We just gotta think. Now we just gotta work together. Packie, you're smart. You're the smartest guy I know. He ruined her life with a picture. So what? Hey, guys. I think I've got an idea. - Pack. - Hmm. You want to keep Frankie out of jail? Yeah. [instrumental music] [muffled grunting] Packie: I don't know about this. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Pack. - You can fucking do this. Packie: Why me? Swaino: Because yours is, by far, the most photogenic. - Packie. - You got it! You can do it, Pack. You can do it. That a boy. - That a boy, Pack. Come on. - You got it. I don't know, guys, just-- it seems a little homophobic. It's a lot fucking homophobic, but that's kind of the fucking point, am I right? Am I right? Swaino: You got it, Pack. Ah, Karen, can you turn around, please? Swaino: Okay, Pack, take it off. Not your shirt, the-- the-- the pillowcase. That's it. Chad: What the fuck is this? Karen: Holy shit, Packie. - Open your mouth. No way, no fucking way! - Open your mouth. - No fucking way. Open your fucking mouth. [machine whirring] [sobbing] Atta-boy. Uh, wh-- what's the passcode? One, two, three, four, five, six. I-- I think I'm on the wrong screen. Just get the fucking picture. Okay, okay, okay. I got it. I got it. I got it! Right there. [coughing] Show him. Hey, can you tell it's me? Only if someone's seen your cock, Pack. I think you're safe. Yeah, and what the fuck are you gonna do with that? Okay, Chad. Now the way we see it, there's two options in how we move forward. Option one, you go, you run like the little bitch you are, you run to your father, run to the cops. You're all fucked. Swaino: Excuse me, young man. - Every one of you. Swaino: Excuse me. You interrupted me. Now you can go to the cops, but I'm gonna tell you right now, my friend right there, he's a social networking fucking genius. And he will post this picture. It'll go everywhere. I mean, everywhere. It'll do that thing. What's that thing called, Pack? - Going viral. - It'll go fucking viral. It'll go fucking viral. No, I'll tell the truth. And when that comes out, they'll believe me. It won't make a fucking difference, Chad, and you know it. Truth will make 'em share it even more, probably. - Probably. - Know something, Chad? No one's gonna pay you that $2,200 an hour. Shit, you'll be unhirable, Chad. Your father, those bullshit billionaire clients of his, they're gonna laugh at you. Every single time you walk out of a room, they're gonna laugh. Maybe your friends will come up with a nickname for you this time. Yeah, like Captain Dick Sucker. Yeah, hopefully, a little more creative than that, but, yes, something along those lines. Option two. You want to hear option two? You walk out of here... and you never, ever mention this night to anyone, anywhere, and it'll be like this whole night, including this very provocative photo... never fucking happened. What's it gonna be, Chad? Option two. Goddamn right. Cut him free. Get the fuck out of my shop. [keys clatter] [mellow music] [sighs] [music continues] [music continues] Your family's here.
