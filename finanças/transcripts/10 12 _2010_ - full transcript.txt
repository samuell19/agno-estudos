Autumn 2001 You fuck! Stop! Stop! No! Are you Kevin? Yeah. That hurts, shit! Calm down. Tommy Leblanc's crazy. He forced my kid brother to suck him off. - Did he tell you that? - Come on. His cheekbone's broken. There's been bleeding, swelling, bruises... His tongue's cut, but he'll soon be eating normally. When will he be released? Three, four days. A week maybe. Nobody's come to visit him. Doesn't the boy have a family? Yes, but I've been looking after him. His mom's mentally unstable, his dad doesn't have a phone. I had to get the police to inform him. Are you getting good care, Tommy? Why's it called The Springboard? Because it's a place that helps you change, go further in life. It's an expression, an image. Is there a pool? Hello. Hi, Tommy. I'm Gilles, Gilles S?guin. Hi. - I'm Evelyne, the S.W. - A pleasure. I bet you'll like it here, right, Tommy? Yeah. I'm sure you'll like it. If things go well. This way. A real nice room, you'll be fine here. Thanks. You can call me anytime, if you need anything. If I'm not there, leave a message and I'll call back. I'll walk you back. Bye, buddy. Here, can you read this while I'm gone? I'll be back in five minutes. What's this? It's your curtain. See? There's Velcro on it. Ok, I'll show you. You hang it up here, like this. If you want light, you pull it off. Did you have time to read it? What do you think about it? Didn't you read it? That's ok. We'll go over it together. Sit up. Come on. Read it out loud and I'll explain as we go along. W... el... Wel... co... Welco... ...come. Welcome... Tommy, what grade are you in at school? - Grade 4. - Grade 4? Ok. Or grade 3. Grade 3. Fine. No problem. We have a class here, and a teacher. You'll attend. Let me explain how things work here. Can you look at me? Tommy? Can you look at me? The only thing we ask of you here is respect. Look at me, Tommy. Respect for others. Respect for things. You don't break things, insult people. You wash. Understand? Thanks for keeping this place neat and clean No desserts after 5:30 I follow instructions without complaining I talk only to the other boys at my table Ok, calm down, gentlemen. Dinner is about to start. What did she just say? Calm down! S?bastien? - Milk for you, right? - Yeah. Enjoy your meal. Olivier? Gilles! I don't want any salad. Eat a little, pal. Enjoy your meal. Tommy? Everyone here take pills? Not everyone, but almost. Why? Some have trouble sleeping and pills help them sleep better. Some feel stressed and it makes them less aggressive. Will I take 'em? It depends. You have to see the doctor for that. After the observation period. Know what an observation period is? - No idea. - No? The first few weeks, the educators will observe you. We watch the way you behave, how you are with others. We'll take notes, to see how you eat, how you sleep. We're always watching you. They never stop! What about outings? Outings? At my last foster family, we went canoeing, or to the city... We never go out! Yes we do, Roger. If you deserve it, are well behaved. Right. We never go out. Hold on. He eats like a pig! Ok, who said that? Who said that? Just joking! It shows lack of respect, Roger. You go to the bench. He does eat like a pig! Stop that or you'll go to your room. Attaboy, Tommy! He scores! Nice goal! Keep it up, guys. Careful! Keep playing, guys. Give him room. You ok, Tommy? It hurts. Your knee? Lean against the wall. Show me. We'll check it inside, ok? Ok, guys. Transition! We just started to play! You've had time. Careful with your sticks. What's going on? Take it easy, guys. Line up by the wall. What did I tell you? What did I tell you? We had an agreement. Settle down. There'll be a consequence if you don't stop. Everyone's quiet? We can go in? Hurry up if you want to watch TV. Tommy! See, Tommy. It's 8:03 so I make a note here. You have to be out of the bathroom by 8:13. Be finished showering, drying off, dressing and all that. I don't know how long it takes to shower. I do, 10 minutes. Get going, or no TV. You go to bed early. How come? Some boys can't fall asleep, get too excited. They go to bed at 8:30. Those who sleep well go to bed 1/2 hour later. You're new. You go to bed early. Ok, go! You're in your room for the night in 25 minutes. Shit! You sleepin', you asshole? Tomorrow you're gonna get it. Quit the noise! I wanna sleep! Up yours! Christ, cut it out! - Fuck you! - Up yours! Christ! I'm gonna cut you! Hey, shut the fuck up. We wanna sleep! Shut up, for Christ sake! Assistance needed upstairs. Fuck you! Go fuck yourselves! I'm gonna kill all of you. I'm gonna smash your face, slimeball! You gonna pipe down, you shits? I think it's Fran?ois. Stop or you'll go you know where, Eric! Shit, there're others here! S?bastien? That's enough! Calm down! Get back in bed. Back in bed, please. That's enough! Stop or I'll send you to the isolation room. Now calm down. Why not him? Why always me? Go to hell, you shit. Stand back, I'm coming in. Fran?ois, no! Calm down, I'm coming in. Fuck you! I'm coming in. - Will you stop yelling? - It's him! We'll take care of it. You stop yelling. Shit, let me go! You bunch of assholes! Hey, new guy! Your mother sucks cocks and eats pussy! I'm glad to have you in my class. To start, I'll explain how it works. Every boy here has the right to feel at ease, to feel safe. I won't let anyone here be insulted, or denigrated. Do you know what "denigrate" means? It means to put others down, tell someone he's dumb. I won't allow that. You come to school to learn, and can stay in this class only if you respect that. Understand? What grade did you complete? Grade 3. Here. Read this passage for me. Something fuckin' stinks here! Smells like shit. Roger? It wasn't me. Come outside. I said I didn't do anything! Out into the hallway, Roger! Come on, get going. How about changing? No, I told you... Hey, it smells, you know. Turn around. Lift your shirt. He shits his pants and says he didn't do it. Fuckin' liar! Look, I see it. You go shower and change. It's ok. Get the fuck out of here! You're fuckin' disgusting. You're going too far. He shits in class. Fuck! If you don't want to take part here, you can go back upstairs. So take me up. Fine, take me upstairs. No, it's you who's going upstairs. Place is full of fuckin' pigs. He shits his pants and she throws me out. Go to hell, shit! Restraint! Fuck, no. Stop. Fuck! Well, now. Busy day, Tommy. You don't want to reflect on it? If you want to try again, I'll get more paper. Fuck you. I'm not gonna write no fuckin' reflection. I want out of this room, understand? Then reflect on it, write it down. Fuck off. Look, you'll write it or talk to me, but you'll do it. Out! Get the fuck out, you loser. I'm gonna get a gun and kill the bunch a you! I'll be back for dinner. Are you hungry? Eat shit! Are you ready to talk? Can you get ready for your shower, please? Where is everybody? Outside. I wanna go play too. You didn't write your reflection, your room's wrecked, you make threats... Stupid fucks! Stop it! Go! Go! Stop! Calm down! Calm down! Lemme go! Calm down. Take him upstairs. This is pointless, Tommy. Calm down. Calm down. I want out of here! I want out of here! I want out! Fuck. I want out of here! Yeah, real nice. Ok, get ready to shower, guys. Hurry up and you'll get to watch the movie. Fuck! Why? Back to your rooms, guys. Go! Into your rooms! I said into your rooms! We have to go in. You're such a shithead, fuck! Fuck! Calm down, Tommy! Calm down. Sure, go ahead! Grab my dick. Fuck! Fuckin' gang of fags. I'm gonna file a complaint against you. Don't move. You like touching my cock, huh? Go ahead, touch it, go on! Grab my dick! I'm gonna kill every one of you! I'll kill... You'll stay here until you calm down, ok? Can you explain to me what just happened? Can you explain what happened today? You calm enough to go back? What can we do to prevent these tantrums? Tommy! You can't enjoy these tantrums. You can't enjoy having them, right? You must feel bad afterward. Why do you do it? Why do you do it, Tommy? 'Cause people fuck with me. Fuckin', fuckin'... If we all acted like you when people bug us, great! We'll keep using security to stop you. If you hit us or spit, we have to stop you so no one gets hurt. Only you can stop your violent outbursts. I'm your educator. You have to trust me. Want to stop now? - No! - No? Come sit down. Let's talk about what you did to that 7-year-old. Ok. The cops say you wanted him to put your penis in his mouth. True? Yeah. Did you force him? - No. - No? - Did you threaten him? - No! What did you say to him? You'd rather fart than talk, so we stop. You'll go to class. No, let's talk. But I'm the only one talking. Come on, Gilles. Sit down. I'll answer all your questions. Come on! How come your dad has no phone? Did he ever have one? See, you're not trying. I'm doing all the work. Want to talk about something else? Enough, stop that! Come on! Sure, just take off. Stop that. You're the one not talking. Fuck, I said I'd talk to you. You aren't talking, you're yelling. Go to your room. Go think about it in your room. Fuck! I have to go to the toilet! Go, quick, quick. Come right back. Can I go see Karine? Sure. Hi. You ok? Yeah. What's up? Nothing. I came to see you. What are you doing? What? Tommy, stop that. What? Stop rubbing yourself. I'm not. Go think it over in your room for 10 minutes. What? Tommy, stop it right now. Fuckin' sicko. You're imagining things. Backup needed. What's going on? What's wrong? Stop! Keep playing. She came by again. She left her cell number so you can call her. She says Tommy's in a center. - Really? Can I... - Yeah. Stop staring at me. Hi, Gilles. Bravo, Tommy. It's great to see you working. If you keep it up I'll have to reward you. Thanks. You were studying well. Really? Julie was pleased. If you don't want to try, go to the bench. Hey, Gilles? What? Can I come back now? Nothing will happen? No, I swear. Jesus! A booger on my plate! - Stop it! - Disgusting. That cook's a dirty slut. Up you go! Up to your room! It wasn't me. Never is, it was... Up to your room! I don't want to. Let me go, I don't want to! It wasn't me! It was your fault! It's never me, you fuckers! Again. Almost there. You ok? It seems that you rubbed your penis on a door frame? Yeah. Does that make you feel good? How'd you leam to do that? I just did. They brought you to see me because you have tantrums. Every day. Is that true? Yeah. Want to tell me what goes on? Unless you prefer to... have one now, give me a private showing. Is there something you want to tell me? I don't like people fuckin' with me. Violence is nothing new to you, right? You learned that when you were little? He's... certainly someone I would take on. I'll see him every two weeks, ok? Fine. - Did he talk to you? - No. Prescribe him anything? No, nothing. Nothing? He's very aggressive, you know. He's highly reactive. In my whole 17 years, I've never seen tantrums like his. I don't think it's necessary. Violence is his form of expression. He's just trying to provoke you. Don't interact with him unless he's calm. Which is why I bring up medication for him. To calm him down a bit, so I can talk with him, help him. I have 9 other boys to look after and with Tommy I can't. Giving him medication won't teach him not to use violence. We know nothing about his past. You have to nurture him, try to let him enjoy himself a little. Try to love him. I understand all that, but the problem is I can't even talk to him. You need to give him time. Just give him time. If he doesn't change, can't form a relationship with you or another adult, we'll be able to say he's slipping into mental illness. But we're not there yet. Won't you at least try? No way. Find a different psychiatrist. - Did you say he has daily tantrums? - Yeah, I told her. Tommy never feels remorse. He never says sorry. I tell you, he's a future psychopath who'll end up in prison, kill someone. Did she give you any direction, ideas? She said not to react during a tantrum, to nurture him, to love him. To love him, but without emotion. I'll try that on my boyfriend! What? Isn't there some other psychiatrist? In the meantime, what do we do? Every night when I leave, I'm completely strung out. I never fall asleep before 4 a. m. Same for me. It's so obvious. The kid doesn't belong here. He's got to go. Let some psychiatry ward take him. We can't just unload problem kids on mental hospitals. It's not that, but Tommy keeps us from doing our job with the other kids. He's always acting out. We want this for the other kids, not for him. Are your superiors aware of the violence here? They say it's part of the job. Anyway, Tommy's here. He lives here and we'll take care of him. Everyone ok with that? Did you shit your pants again? - Jesus! - Disgusting. Come on, let's get you changed. Simon, no giving him the finger or threats. To the bench! Why me and not him? He's the one pulling stunts. If you settle down, you'll be back here in 5 minutes. You got caught. Tommy, what're you doing? Stop that! Ok, go wipe yourself off. In the kitchen. Come here, I'll tidy you up. Hold on a minute. I need authorization for a full search. Kitchen knives. No, all the rooms. Everywhere. I found them. It's Tommy. I wasn't gonna attack anyone. I didn't do anything! Because we caught you first. We won't let you kill someone. Fuck! That hurts! Gilles! I'll do it the way you want. Let me go! Another one of your lies? No! You can see I'm not having a tantrum. Fuck, let me go. You're really hurting me. Ok, you can walk. But any violence and we grab you. I don't want to. Gilles, don't lock me up. I'm fuckin' calm. You're not. You're screaming at me. You got no right to lock me up. You got no right! That's enough. Fuck! When it comes to knives, we can't take any chances. Fuck, I'm gonna kill myself. I'm gonna kill myself! I'm gonna kill myself! Fuck, I'm gonna kill myself. I'm gonna kill myself, fuck! Fuck! Gilles, let me out! Fuck, I can't breathe. I'm gonna strangle myself. Let me out! Let me out! Get me outta here! I want some water! Ok, hold on. What are you trying to pull? Still say you didn't plan to attack anyone? You're gonna tell me your plan, dammit! Look at me! I wrote your reflection. Leave me alone. Get out! Fuck, you hurt me. You got no right! I'll file a complaint, you'll lose your job. Go ahead. Josse's right there, file a complaint. You broke me, bravo! Do it! Sure, punch the wall! Stop that! Stop it! Stop, Tommy. Enough! Stop. Calm down. Stop. Stop, Tommy. Stay there! Stay there! Christ! I asked you a simple question! Why did you steal the knives? I like to sleep with knives! Why? Why? Are you scared? Of what? How do I know? It's not normal to sleep with knives! Don't you remember anything? No! I don't know! My mom asked me the same fuckin' thing. You like knives, that's all? Yeah! Ok, Tommy. I'll believe you. We'll say you didn't intend to harm anyone. I'm gonna trust you, Tommy. But you try trusting me, too. Just a little, at least. Ok, Tommy? - Fran?ois, calm down. - No! - Listen to me. - No! - Let go of the handle. - Bitch! No fuckin' way! - Go sit down! - Get lost! - Leave me be! - We're coming in! I'm coming in! Asecurity guy got hurt. Someone slammed the door on his finger. You're not the only one there who has tantrums? Nope. How does anger like that make you feel? I don't know. And at home, how did you feel when your parents got angry? Where are you going? Can I go see Roger? Ok, fine. Hi. So it's you who takes care of the garbage? Yeah, they trust me. You could run away... Yeah, but I don't feel like it. No fun if you have no place to go. We could run away together. No. But you go if you want to. I could leave the door open. Can I go to the toilet? Sure, Tommy, but don't try anything. - You helped him, huh? - No. Look how calm they are. There's a lot less tension. I know, he sucks up the air we breathe. Pollutes it, you mean. Hey, Josse, I was wondering... if you'd call the cops, ask them to take their time? Three or four days would do us good. You serious? Or find him half-dead in a vacant lot, maybe? You better stop doin' that - runnin' away all the time. Sure. They sent me to a new center. Yeah, the social worker let me know. Seems you're no piece of cake. Still having those tantrums? We're locked in. Takes three of them to shut me in isolation. You proud of that? No. You love it, don't you, making 'em mad? I'd say you're proud of it. I'm not proud of it! Ya little shit! Always goin' off, huh? Can't you listen to nobody? If I listen to you, can I stay here? I'm flat broke until next month. There's no food. I can't even gas up the car. You go back to that center. Shit, I never get to do anything! Can't we go see Mom at least? I got no money. We need gas for that. Anyway, she wouldn't recognize you. She's my mother! I fuckin' wanna see her! Christ, my social worker says she delivers flyers! She says lots of stuff. She wrote a report saying I don't wanna talk to her, that I have no phone. Well, that's true. No, she's lying. I have no phone, ok. But I don't wanna talk to her? Can I stay for 2 or 3 days? What'd I say? No! This's fuckin' bullshit! Enough, goddammit! Is that what you want? Is it? Stop, stop! You stop! Calm down! I don't want to fight you. I'll call the cops to come get you. Ok? I'll make a deal with you. If you wanna come live here, we do it right. You'll go back to the center and stay cool. If things go good, I'll come get you on weekends. I should be getting some money soon. Welfare owes me a bundle. They've taken a bit off my cheque every month for ages. They might give it back, all in one shot. It's not a sure thing, yet. Ajudge will decide who wins, me or the welfare office. If I win, I'll be able to buy you a Nintendo, a bike, some new threads... It'd be great if you win. Okay, then! You'll come home on weekends, and I'll spoil you a bit. And then... maybe sometime, you could come home for good. For your gas. Thanks a lot. He'll go to sleep early tonight. Slept outside! This way. We'll go sit in the conference room. I don't have time. Gotta go. I drove him here... I'm goin'. You try hard, like we said. Hey, big fella, you're back. Hi. Gilles S?guin. I'm Tommy's educator. Let's talk, sit down. Nah, as I was saying, I really gotta go. So... You listen to Gilles if you wanna come home. Bye. When can we talk? - Call me. - At the store? Sure, I'll let you know. We need to figure out what to do with Tommy. I trust you, when it comes to decisions about Tommy. Plus, looking at you, I figure you have a head on your shoulders. But I'd like to know more about him. About you too. And his mom, childhood. We'll talk! Hold it a minute. Turn off the car, please. For me to help your son, I'll need a hand. I need info on his childhood. He's forgotten. - We'll talk. - Ok. He stole some knives, put them under his pillow. Some think he wants to stab someone. Christ, he's 10! Yeah, but we know nothing about him so we imagine... - That's why you have to tell me. - I'll call, ok? I'll see. ASAP, because I need your help. I can't do it alone. Thanks. Was it fun, being a runaway? Yeah, it was good. You wanted an outing, you had one. Except it means you can't use the large playground. Dad said he'd take me weekends if it goes good here. Really? What's that mean, "if it goes good here"? It means do what I'm supposed to. Like? Like... stop having tantrums? Yeah? Are you able to do that? Tell me why you forced him to take your penis in his mouth. To see what it's like... Like in pornos. Have you watched many? Yeah. About how many? Don't know. Lots. I saw my mom do that to her boyfriend lots. To your dad? No, not my dad. Tommy, do you know how we make babies? By fuckin', doh! And where does the man put his penis to make a baby? You've made real progress, I'm proud of you. But what do you have to do when the urge hits? You ask me. Want to go play with the others? - You can go. - Thanks. I'm sorry I said you smelled like shit. When? Oh, when you got here. Forget it, I'm used to it. Does it happen a lot? What? You shit your pants? Quite a lot. Why's it happen? Some educators say it's because of stress. Others say my parents never taught me to go to the toilet. Is that something you learn? Apparently. But be careful, man, because it really stinks. I know. Who's your educator? M?lanie. - You're so lucky! - I know. You can give her hugs? Yeah. Are you jealous? - She has huge... - Huge eyes, I know. You just had it. Fuck, let go! - You just went. - Let go! You just went, you prick. Fuck you!! I'm gonna kill you! You fuckin' asshole! I'm gonna smash your brains in. I'm gonna smash his shitty face. He's gonna bleed like a pig! - Because of him we have to... - He's the fuckin' problem. Quiet, in your rooms! Cool. Way cool. They'll never find us here. Wanna try something? M?lanie... M?lanie... That's enough! Sure, open the door. Sure, I get it. Thanks a lot! Seen Roger or Tommy? No. I'll be back. Won't be long. You check the showers, I'll look downstairs. Ok. Hey, guys? Seen Roger and Tommy? Go, go, go! We have to find 'em. You check the basement. I'll do the office. I'm quitting. I can't. There's no cum. What's that? No cum, no sperm. Me neither. Pull up your pants, guys. You're going back to the center. What do you wanna ask, or need to know? Could we meet? Look, let's do it here, right now. How's that? We good? That's fine. So, what? For one, why's your name Lebeau and Tommy's is Leblanc? I told someone from Youth Protection. Well, I don't have any record of it. I didn't accept Tommy as my son when he was born. For the forms, 'cause the welfare cheque for single mothers was bigger. Makes sense, no? Tommy has his mom's name instead. I regret it. A real bummer. Can you explain why Tommy wants to sleep with knives? Like to tell me about that? Tommy's mom and me, we did a lot of drugs. We drank together. We'd get stoned. When we were out of it, sometimes we'd fight. She was already half crazy, I couldn't hack it. I was goin' crazy myself... And now... She's really lost it. Do you want to talk another time? Sorry. No, it's fine. Christ! It's fine. We'll talk about it this once, then no more. There's one thing I'd like to tell you. Sonia told me one night when we were drunk. She never talked about it sober. I'm so friggin' tired. Fuck, you'll be the end of me yet. Let go of my nice jacket, for Christ sake! You're such a pain, Christ! Stop that, Tommy! Fuck! Are you gonna listen to me, you little fucker? You gonna listen to me? Let go! Tommy, you gonna listen? Shut up! You shut up! You listenin' to me when I say stop cryin'? How's the kid doin'? He's doing fine, since you said you'd take him on weekends. When I got my life back on track. But I'm not there yet. He's counting on you. I know. We can't give up on him. I think he has a chance. Sure looks like it. That's why I called you today. I'll keep my promise of taking him, I'm gonna do it. But for now you guys at Youth Protection are taking care of him. Yeah. I trust you. What do you mean? You told me not to give up. But don't you either. He's in your hands now. He's in your hands. It's up to all of you to take care of him. Ok, I think I understand. It'll all work out, Luc. Was there anything else? Thank you. Goddammit! It's cool being here. If you behave we can do it more often. Even when B?dard's here? What do you mean? He doesn't seem to like kids. That's not it. You don't do this work if you don't like kids. But he's like everybody... He's tired of being attacked, being insulted. It wears you down. Remember when you yelled I was a fucking fag? Can you say you're sorry? Well, do it. I'm sorry. Thanks, good to hear. Ready for bed now? Come on, I'll go with you. Good night. Take off your shoes. You won't disturb the others? You'll behave tonight? Good night. Fran?ois, hurry up. Hi, Karine! Gimme a hug! That's enough. Go finish brushing your teeth. Move it, guys. It's my fault. I never thought it would tum sexual. Don't feel guilty. How could you know? Still, Tommy's a pervert. Turning expressions of affection into something dirty... His hands are always in his pants. Men have their hands in their pants until the day they die. Until we know more, we shouldn't consider him a pervert or psychopath. If our minds are made up, that's it. Why keep him here? He's here because the psychiatric wards are full. He's sick. From now on I'm treating him as a victim, not an aggressor. And I'm taking him out, whether or not he behaves. Those are team decisions. We're not on the same team. I've moved on. - Let me finish. - Please, let him talk. I want to try things, in the community. - Outings are rewards. - I know. I want to see him in a normal situation. Being locked in is stifling for us. Imagine for them! What else? The next time he has a tantrum, we let him act out. Like the shrink said. We don't talk to him, we don't intervene. We only talk to him when he's calm. No more hugging because when some of you hugged female staff, you touched their breasts. Did you? I never did that! From now on, we respect the women's space. No touching. I know not everyone did it, but I don't want to have to play cop. So the line is clear, it's not allowed. Alright? Thanks, guys. Yes? No! I don't want to, fuck! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you all! Open the door, fuck! Lemme outta here! Gilles! I wanna talk to you! Gilles, I wanna talk to you! Gilles, c'mere, I wanna talk to you! I wanna talk to you, Gilles. You have to calm down. I just wanna talk to you! Go fuck yourself! Go fuck yourself! Gilles, I wanna talk to you. Gilles, I wanna talk to you. It's been nearly three hours. Yeah. Are you calm now? Can we talk? What did you want to say? I wanted to tell you to let me out. That's how it's going to be now. You can rage as much as you want, I'll ignore you and ask the others to do the same. You've no right to leave me alone! Or ignore me! You've no right! That's how it is, and that's how it'll be. Desire and arousal are two different things. Desire is when you see a girl or a woman you find attractive and you think, I'd like to make love with her. Arousal is when two people touch each other. When a man or a boy is aroused, his penis is erect. We say he has a hard-on. Here, read this to me. E... rec... tion? - Erection. - Right. So when the penis is erect, it's hard and can enter your partner's vagina. Partner? Your girlfriend or wife. After a while, during penetration, the sperm comes out and you make babies. Is that why you need to use condoms? Yes. Do you use them often? Yes. How many times? I dunno. Hundreds, maybe. I haven't counted. What about assfucking? Can that make babies? That's different. That's about arousal. You see, when two people make love together, it's intimate. It's a secret they share. They can make love how they want. And fingering someone's ass? That's also making love the way they want. What about you? Do you like that? It's none of your business. That's something intimate, you see. This is a store for welfare bums. No it isn't. Lots of students buy great clothes here. With the $60 I have for you, we can buy loads of stuff. Anywhere else we'd just get a sweater and pants. Look. I'm not wearing that, it sucks. Take a second look. Want me to wear those? Those, no. Looks good on you. Here, try this. Go on. Gilles? Yes. Pretty cool, huh? You like it? Yeah. If you buy it for me, I'll be super good. Please! Ok, we'll take it. Do you want one too? Yeah. Your change. - Fuck you're awesome. - Don't swear. But you are awesome. Shall we go? Wait. - What? - Wait. I located your mom's phone number. Want to call her? Well? You don't seem too sure. Mrs Leblanc? I got a pain in the side of my gut since they opened me up. Shit. Want me to call back later? No. Your son Tommy is with me. He wants to talk to you. Is that ok? Take the phone, Tommy. Take the phone. Just one second. Line 1, top button. Hi, Mom. Is that you, Tommy? Yes. Are you ok, Tommy? Yeah. Me too. You getting enough to eat? Yeah. Me too. Tommy? Mommy doesn't like it when you call at night. Call me in the day. I never called you. Don't go sayin' that. You call me every night, almost. You go, Mommy! And when I get up in the moming, I'm so tired. It's not me! What'll I do? I got no more cigarettes. I got no more cigarettes. What'll I do? Open the door. Bye, Mom. You gonna mention her at the team meeting? Why? Will you tell them how she is? What would you like? I don't want you to mention her. Look, he works. He doesn't earn a cent, but he works. Guys, look how the dog works. Ready? Here we go, Cougar. Good dog! - Ok runaways, wanna see? - Yes! - You won't run away? - No! Stay next to Jean-Luc and me, ok? Simon! Can we pet them? We'll start with you, Jean-S?b. I'll remove the harness. Why do I remove the harness? When he's wearing it, he's working. You can't pet him. Ok, Jean-S?b. Tommy? To thank you for inviting us, we brought you presents. We'll have a draw for a toy and a cap. M?lanie said to use room numbers. So I'll just guess. I'll say room number... 4... - wins the stuffed animal. - I won! Fran?ois, stay seated. And the cap goes to number... - 2. - That's me! I have key chains for the rest. Say thank you, guys. Thank you! Gilles! Fuck! Tommy, stop it. It's 10 o'clock. Somebody stole my key ring! Don't go crazy over a key ring. Shit, I had it, Gilles! You had it outside. I had it! Somebody stole it from me! Come sit down. Tommy, look at me. Look at me. I'll search outside, ok? Look at me. I'll search outside, see if it's there. Calm down, ok? The others are sleeping. Is that alright? I'll go look. Stop yelling. I want my key ring. You dropped it, we'll get another. I didn't! Some bastard here stole it from me! Stop it or I'll call security. I don't give a fuck. Here! No, shit! I'm sorry I had a tantrum over a key ring. You're sorry? Really? You're sorry? Yeah, I'm sorry. You're sorry, but what's to say you won't do it again? Why are you on my case today? I did your reflection! I let you out to see the seeing eye dogs. You were real glad I trusted you. And to thank me, what do you do? You throw a tantrum? You can't even appreciate the good things that happen. Even that makes you go crazy. I bought you new clothes, arranged for you to talk to your mom. There's no improvement. You still eat sloppily, you're always dirty. I'd like to help you, Tommy. But you won't let me. I don't need you, you asshole! Get yourself a ball. You goddam fag! I'm gonna kill you! - Fran?ois! - Shit! - Stop it! - Simon, stop! Let him go! Fuck you! What are you doing? - I'll kill you! - You bastard! - Fuck you, you fag! - I'll fuck you up! I screwed up. You managed to develop a meaningful relationship with the boy. Thanks. Is that you, Tommy? Why are you eating chips outside? It's freezing! Nobody's home, the door's locked. Come to my place, at least you'll be warm. Besides, I have video games. Wait here. I'll buy something and be right back. Well, come in. Make yourself at home. Here, take this. Tommy? You're all dirty. You're soaking. Go take a shower to warm up. Go on! You can keep playing after. You'll see, you'll feel much better. Need any help, Tommy? No, I'm fine. I can manage alone, Normand. Whatever you say. Tommy, I'm gonna test you. Wanna make an easy ten bucks? Sure, how? If you finish the bottle, I'll give you $10. I don't believe you. Here. It tastes awful. Take it slow. But not too slow. The $10 is yours if you drink it all in 20 minutes, 20 minutes. It's Tommy. Lemme in, I'm cold. Subtitles by Robert Gray, Kinograph DVD Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
