[Shouts] Good going, Dr. Jordan. I'll make you a Godan yet. That was sloppy, kid, and you know it. Don't use your diplomacy on me. Look, I respect you too much. Alright, for a black belt it was sloppy. You broke the boards but your technique was off. Now watch. Professor, I'm glad you're on our side. They train just as well on the other side. Let's go. [Chuckling] Oh, Alex, you're positively electrifying. [Electricity hisses] [Electricity hisses] - What happened? - Get that thing off him! Stop it! Stop it! Easy, easy. - Stand back! - Take care. - Watch yourself. - Watch it. - [Electric hiss] - Aaah! Oh! Oh, God. Why did Mitch have to play hero? He's an engineer. He should have let one of us go up. We know these wires. Gus...Gus was dead before he even hit the ground. Have they radioed for an ambulance yet? Yeah, it's on its way. Mitch? Mitch! - [Siren wailing] - Can you hear me? He's dead. [Siren wailing] He looks bad. He really does. Here's the doc now. Hurry, Doc. - Gus is dead. - He's...he's dead, Doc. Yeah, I have to call the coroner on this man. Don't move him till the coroner gets here. What happened? It was a... You tell him. Yeah, well, what difference does it make? - How is he? - This man's alive. Get the stretcher. Let's take him the hospital. - You serious, Doc? - It's pretty bad, though. Alright. Just roll him on. That's it. Watch him when you move him. Watch his head. Drop him carefully. Alright. Alright. - [Groaning] - Easy! Easy! Easy! After me. I'm driving. [Sirens wailing] 'Science knows that people contact the world around them by their five senses, sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. But many times, a person reports an awareness of a happening where none of these channels could possibly be involved. This, then, is the sixth sense, the extrasensory perception, commonly known as E.S.P. The Russians for the past decade have intensified their experimentation in extrasensory research. They're working and experimenting on a crash program whose goal is to surpass America in the field of parapsychology, that branch of science which deals with a range of mental activities commonly called psychic. Dr. Alex Jordan, a renowned parapsychologist, is employed by a branch of the federal government for top-secret work in E.S.P. and its relationship to American defense. This organization is determined that the United States will be the first to communicate with other planets, the first to advance in the field of E.S.P., and the last to perish in an all-out nuclear war.' No doubt about it, Dr. White, Cronin Mitchell is one of the finest sensitives that I've ever tested. Now, it may be that his accident was the cause. I don't know. Or it may be the electrical current that he was subjected to. We have several theories. Dr. Roxin, are you sure? I thought he might be faking. That's why I called the university. I know that you people are interested in this kind of thing. I'm sure. I've tested literally thousands of these psychics and he ran through my deck of E.S.P. cards as though it was child's play. He acts almost deranged. Well, he may still be suffering from some form of shock. But a phony? Absolutely not. I've seen too many of these self-styled psychics to be fooled. By the way, Doctor, that's a ghastly burn that he's received. Can plastic surgery be employed? No, the tissues are burned too deeply. I don't know what'll become of him. He feels his life is over. God only knows what he can do with a face like that. I feel sorry for him. Seems a shame, Doctor. His friends tell me that he's a different man since the accident. Cynical, almost morbid. Of course anybody would be affected that received a shock like that. But his sense of E.S.P. is fantastic. Under controlled situations, he's even moved an object. Three of clubs. - Queen of hearts. - This is too much. You've named 30 cards correctly. I could name 52 out of 52 if I wanted to. A thousand out of a thousand. You're fantastic. Can you tell me something about myself, Mr. Mitchell? You'll marry within the year. You'll have two children. No, three. Your husband's name will be Roy. Why, that's the name of the boy you were out with last night. Remember last night in his car? Why, Miss Browning, I'm surprised at you. That will be quite enough. I should have realized that it's impossible to be nice to someone like you. Oh, I'll show you how you can really be nice to me. Aaah! You'll listen to me but you won't look at me! You...you're disgusting! No-one can look at you, not even yourself! A freak like you should have died! Get out! Go! Go! [Laughing] [Sobbing] From your ring, I can tell that you will move to San Francisco in two years and eight months. Would you like to know the name of your next lover? That will be quite enough, Mr. Mitchell. Oh, by the way, my husband would like to know the name of the horse that will win in the fourth race tomorrow. Ah. The horse that will win the fourth race will be... the one on which your husband does not bet! That will be all, madam! Something... is going to happen. Uh...good day, Mr. Mitchell! They tell me you are a gifted psychic. Well, can you do nothing but stare? Oh...oh, yes, yes, of course. Do you want a reading? Oh, perhaps, Mr. Mitchell. Perhaps. Must we have this? Oh, well, well! So, I have come to the right place. The Bible of the Witches. But certainly a fine clairvoyant such as yourself knows that witches don't exist? Or do you believe in witchcraft, Mr. Mitchell? What do you want? How did you get in here? Let's just say I have ways. But I haven't much time. I've made a long journey, Mr. Mitchell, and I don't think it will be in vain. You are psychic and let's say that I have certain powers too. For instance, I can look into your heart and tell you your deepest desires. What is this? - Get to the point! - Yes, yes, Mr. Mitchell. The point is that I know what you want and I have the power to give it to you. For a small price, of course. I'll strike a bargain with you that will give you back your pretty face. Go on. Become... my lover, then you shall have your pretty face. Or refuse and spend the rest of your life hidden behind that mask, because nobody can stand to look at you. Become your lover? [Laughs] That's a laugh! Why, you're even uglier than I am! Go on, get out of here, you crazy old fool! No! Look, Cronin Mitchell! Look in the mirror! What do you see? [He sobs] [Inaudible] Hey there! Having a good time? Huh? Oh...! Hey, baby. Hey, baby, hey. Anybody sit down with you here? You're all alone? Pretty girl like you? What are you doing all alone? Oh, let me buy you a drink. How about a drink, baby? Aren't you gonna be sociable? Here, have a little bit of mine. Come on, have a little bit of mine. Here. Don't you want any of my drink? Well, you're not very friendly, I can see that. Let me order you a drink. You have a phone call outside. Who, me? That's right. You've got a phone call. - Phone call outside. - Phone call for me? That's right, right out there. Wait, wait a minute. You stay right there. I'm gonna come right back. Don't go away now. I'm Cronin Mitchell. Pretty girls in trouble usually call me Mitch and they always ask me to join them. Yes. I'm sorry. Please sit down, Mitch. I'm Ellen Parker. You're a beautiful girl, Ellen Parker. Let's see what I can tell you about yourself. Your age is... ...unclear. You're... Something's wrong. I'm not getting anything. You... fear death. You fear... being alone. You know me? I know you, Mitch... ...and I've been waiting for you... ...for a long, long time. Ellen? Ellen? Shall we go, Mitch? Mitch? I'm waiting. [Laughing] So, my proud peacock, you're enjoying your new role as Prince Charming. But don't forget our bargain! You give me love... and I'll give you your pretty face! Come to me, Mitch. My lover. [She laughs] [Screaming] So, Jordan, I want you to go to Jefferson, Wisconsin. If this sensitive is any good, bring him back for testing. It may be a matter of national importance. - When do I leave? - This afternoon. The reservations have been made and there'll be a car waiting for you. Now, Jordan, here's the story. Seven women have been murdered in Jefferson in less than a month. Now, the local police are stymied. The town council's up in arms. The newspapers are full of it. Then this psychic comes along and says that he can solve the murders. The newspapers have given him all the publicity. - Is he any good at all? - He seems good, too good. He was in an accident last summer and he was badly burned, almost burned to death. Then he started appearing on national TV. It's a funny thing, though. What's that? His face. The hospital claims that he was burned so badly that no type of surgery could help him. But on these TV shows, he looks like a movie actor. Bring him back, Jordan. Sounds very mysterious. I'll leave tomorrow. Today, Jordan. Today. Look, he...he travels with a girl. We haven't been able to get a lead on her but...check her out, Doctor. - I certainly will. - You know what I mean. If this psychic is as good as they say he is... ...the Government wants him and now, Jordan. Not tonight, pussycat. I have to leave. There, so you won't forget. I know something that would really make me remember. So do I. Don't be good, Alex. Keep in practice. - I'll see you later. - See you later. I wish all this publicity would die down. Yeah, you'd better believe it. If these murders continue, we'll all be out of a job, including the Chief. By the way, Maddox, have you heard the news? What news? Oh. We're gonna offer a reward to the killer. If he turns himself in. No, I'm serious. You know how these papers have been writing us. Well... now the town council thinks we can't do it without outside help. They're putting the screws on the Chief to let a "sensitive" handle the case. Sensitive? What's a sensitive? A guy who sunburns too easy. No, it's a guy who knows things with a sixth sense or something. They say these guys can solve crimes just by meditating. In other words, Maddox, these are thinking men as opposed to cops. So the experts say. What does the old man think about this? He's not happy but he's a good politician. He plays both ends against the middle. He thinks it won't work. This guy's been on some big TV shows or something, the whole bit. He's just looking for some free publicity, if you ask me. But, uh...nobody asked me. Well... if this guy's on the level, I'll go along with it. So far, we haven't come up with any answers. No clues. No motive. No pattern. This is no ordinary killer. Excuse me, uh...Dr. Jordan? Excuse me. Are you Dr. Jordan? Yeah, that's right. So, this is Jefferson, Wisconsin? Well, I'll put it on the expense account. That is, if there's anything here to put on an expense account. I'm Detective Maddox, Jefferson Police crime detail. The old man's been waiting for you. Okay, Detective Maddox, Jefferson Police crime detail, let's go see the old man. Fine. - Hi, Maddox. - Chief Vinton. - This is Dr. Jordan. - Dr. Jordan. Sit over here, Doc. I have a feeling that I'm not exactly welcome here. It isn't that you're not welcome, Doctor. I truthfully feel you're wasting your time here. I've had an awful lot of pressure from the public and the press and now you're bringing me pressure from the federal government. What are you afraid of, Vinton? Progress? Progress? You might call it that. I call it something else. We're searching for a killer. This killer has killed seven women. Hocus-pocus and magic aren't needed here. I've got my men out looking for clues that don't exist. You university fellows come here and try and help us. Well, frankly, I just don't think it can work. You're right, science doesn't have all the answers. But we are trying. No-one knows the heights to which the mind can reach. Nor the depth. Now, if you as policemen fail, it's forgivable. But if science fails, it's monstrous... ...and that's why I'm here. I want to see if Mitchell is a fake and if he is, demolish him. But if he isn't, well, then it might do well for you to use his help. I'd like to meet Mitchell now if possible. Alright. Maddox, bring Mr. Mitchell into the office. Oh, Mr. Mitchell, this is Dr. Jordan. Dr. Jordan's from Washington D.C. And, uh... this is Miss Ellen Parker. She's Mr. Mitchell's, uh...secretary. Well, Dr. Jordan, I understand you've been sent here to test my validity as a psychic. Well, I'm used to that by now. I assume you're qualified to tell the difference between a true psychic and a phony? I've heard that you've been building quite a reputation as a performer, Mr. Mitchell. Do you like TV acting? I've changed many skeptics into believers in E.S.P., Jordan. Would you like a little demonstration of my... gift? Chief, take an object, any object. Place it on a blank piece of paper on your desk. Don't let me see it. Conceal the object. That is the object you've concealed, Chief. Your wife gave it to you for your birthday. But you think it's too ornate for your office so you compromise by keeping it under the desk blotter. Are you satisfied, Doctor? Very impressive, Mitchell. I don't doubt that you have a highly sensitive mind. But I'd like to know how far these psychic powers go. That, Dr. Jordan, is something that no-one in this world can ever know. Gentlemen. I'm afraid that will be all for today. If you want any further testing of Mr. Mitchell's... ...gift... I suggest you phone him at the hotel. Shall we go, Mitch? Before you go, Mr. Mitchell, I'd like to know something. Now, I'll buy all this talk about radiations or whatever you call it, but what about people? How can this, uh...extra sense of yours lead us to the killer? Detective Maddox, the mind is the greatest power of all. But it's not easy to explain.
