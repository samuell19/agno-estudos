You're down, sir. All right, where is it? You lost. All right, try again. One good one makes up for all the bad ones. Here we go again, my hand against your eye. Find that elusive little pea. Where is it, son? You're wrong! All right, here we go again. Now where is it? You lost. All right, here we go again. Five'll get you 10. Ten'll get you 20. Twenty gets you 40. Double your money, boys. How about you, soldier? Try your luck? Why not? Anybody can play it. How much do you want to bet? All of it. It's a pleasure to do business with you, soldier. All right, here we go. My hand against your eye. All right, watch me very closely. There it is. Now tell me, which shell is the pea under? That one. Now just a minute. What's wrong, Jonesy? I've got a smart soldier here. I'm not smart. If it's not under that shell, lift it up. Let's have a look. Take your money and get out. I'm a curious type. I want to know where the pea is. I'm telling you for your own good, take your money and get out. Uh-uh. All right, boys. There he is, Sarge. Yeah. Here he comes now. He looks real peaceful, don't he? You should have been here a couple of minutes ago. I'm happier this way. All right, men, pick him up. Ah, snap out of it. Snap out of it. The general wants to see you. The general wants to see me, he knows where he can find me. This is an order. My private life is my own. I just started 30 days furlough. You just ended it. Let's go, men. Now listen-- Now wait a minute, Sarge. Take it easy. I got something for you. Oh? Sure! It's easier this way. Sergeant Harder, reporting to the general as ordered. At ease, Jeff. Smoke? No, thanks. How long you been a sergeant, Jeff? Which time? Well, this time. Three months and, uh, 21 days. Your conduct must be improving. When's your enlistment end? Seven months. How'd you like to make captain? Captain? [ Chuckles ] I don't think my conduct has improved that much, sir. I'm serious, Jeff. What do I have to do? "Laramie, Wyoming Territory. Regret to inform you construction delayed at end of track. This point. Stoppage due to certain elements who wish crews to remain... for personal profit. Local authorities unable to cope with situation. Request you send troops to restore order so that work may proceed. Lee Graham, Chief Engineer, K.T.& C. Railroad." What does that have to do with me? I happen to know of your working knowledge... of saloon keepers, gamblers and dancing girls. I might have run across a few at one time or another. You'll leave in the morning, Jeff. With the general's permission, I'd like to refuse this request for my services. Why? Personal, sir. I have a reason for wanting to see a railroad completed... that will link the Atlantic Coast to the Pacific. It's not a personal reason. And my request for your services is not a request, it's an order. You're one of the most capable men I know, Jeff, when you're under orders. And if you perform adequately, your commission will be granted. But if you don't, I give you my word... you'll be in the guardhouse when you're 80. And you'll still owe the government seven months' time! Do I make myself clear? I'll leave in the morning, sir. Good luck, Jeff. Thanks, General. It's an outrage, I tell you. Materials and equipment lying idle... because you can't keep a crew sober long enough to work a shift. And there's one man responsible for it all. You wouldn't be referring to me, would you, Mr. Graham? Naturally I'm referring to you. You've done pretty much as you please in this town for a long time, Shanessy. All that's going to be changed as soon as the troops arrive. Mmm. Mornin', Judge. Mayor. Mornin'. Mornin', Mr. Graham. You don't suppose that train is late, do you? She's right on time, the last report I had on her. [ Man ] Here she comes! Here she comes. [ Whistle Blowing ] Now this time, please, let's all play the same tune. Ready? One, two-- ♪♪ [ March ] Well, it was nice work while it lasted. What makes you think it's over? You don't figure we can lick the whole Union army. The Confederates already tried. Those soldiers don't make much money. They might go blind for a reasonable price. They might at that. Here she comes! Here come the troops. The soldiers are here! Here they are! [ Bell Clanging ] [ Cheering ] Sergeant, I'm Lee Graham, supervising engineer of the K.T.& C. Glad to know you, sir. This is Mayor Logan. Mayor. Judge Pierce. How do you do? Judge. Sergeant Harder, detached service from General Augur's headquarters. Where's your command, Sergeant? What command? The troops I requested. [ Chuckles ] I'm the troops. Are you trying to say General Augur sent only one soldier to clean up this town? It's only one town, isn't it? [ Graham ] I explained the need for troops to the general. I told you not to worry, Ace. The sergeant and I grew up together. [ Graham ] I received this telegraph from Gen. Augur yesterday. "Aid requested will arrive noon tomorrow." Well, it's noon. And I'm here. But we asked for troops, not just one man. The general can't spare any troops. They're all out chasing Cheyennes to keep 'em from tearing up your rails. But to send just one man? This is the most outrageous-- Look, mister, I don't like this any more than you do. I had 28 days leave coming up. Instead I get sworn in as a special marshal and put on detached service. I didn't ask for the job. If you didn't want it, why did you come here? It's better than being in the guardhouse. Or maybe it isn't. I must say that's a peculiar attitude for a marshal to take. Look, mister, if you don't like it, why don't you write the general... and have me transferred and do us both a favor? Young man-- Jim! Jim Shanessy! Jeff Harder. It sure is good to see you. Jim Shanessy, you old colt. Still playing soldier, huh? Oh, you know how it is. Recruiting officer and I got drunk, and I wound up reenlisting. Say, you're looking prosperous. Well, that comes from leading a good, clean life. Boys, I want you to meet an old friend of mine, Jeff Harder. Ace and Con Winton. Glad to know you. Sergeant. Where you staying? I don't know yet, Jim. Well, that makes it easy. I own a hotel here in town. We should be able to find you a room. Oh, on army pay? Who said anything about money? Take his bag, Ace. He looks big enough to carry it. You heard me. Take his bag. The hotel is right over here. You haven't changed a bit, Jeff. It's been a long time, Jim. Oh, I'll, uh-- I'll see you later, gentlemen. Certainly good to have the troops in town, Mr. Graham. Makes a man feel a little more secure. I don't understand. Sergeant Harder, Shanessy friends? You heard 'em, didn't you? They're old friends. You sure you got the right room? Yup. Ah. Soft enough for you? Oh. Don't tell me you've forgotten what an army cot feels like. Who wants to remember? When did you get in the hotel business? When I heard the railroad was coming through Laramie. It was me, I'd figure I'd rather own a saloon. I got one of those too. You want to take a walk over? I'll buy you a drink. Make it later, Jim. I want to wash up a little bit. Well, anytime. I'll be there all afternoon. Helen will be glad to see you. I'll be glad to see her too. You're always welcome at the house. I can remember when I wasn't. Ah, we've grown up since then, Jeff. See you later. Thanks for the room, Jim. [ Door Opens ] [ Door Closes ] I think we all agree that the help General Augur sent... isn't the solution to our problem. The question is, what are we gonna do about it? I intend to leave for Cheyenne the first thing in the morning... and take this matter up with the general personally. I think you're wrong. After all, Sergeant Harder's just arrived in town. Maybe it might be wise to find out what he intends doing before making other arrangements. It's quite obvious he intends doing nothing. You saw him shaking hands with Shanessy at the depot. [ Scoffs ] With the reception we gave him, I can't say that I blame him. Are you trying to defend the man? No. I'm just not condemning him until he has a chance to defend himself. It's still not a one-man job. How do you know? Nobody's ever tried it. Mr. Sommers, the town marshal, has made every effort-- Oh, nonsense, Frank. We all know Orrie's incompetent. The only reason you ever appointed him was because he was your brother-in-law... and you got tired of supporting him. [ Scoffs ] Are you implying that I would use the power of my office-- Gentlemen, please. We haven't yet reached a solution for the problem at hand. I suggest we ask Sergeant Harder to meet with us before we discuss further plans. After that meeting this morning, I'd hate to ask him for anything. You don't have to worry. I'll ask him. [ Knocking On Door ] Don't mind me. Just make yourself at home. Don't get touchy, Sergeant. Jim sent us up to see if there's anything we could do for you. There's something you can do. He can pick up my hat. He's real funny, Ace. Yeah. Now tell him why we came, and let's get outta here. Don't bother telling me. Just get out. Don't mind him. He's got no sense of humor. What's that? Money. Whose? It's yours now. - Why? - Well, the boys heard how you got done out of your furlough. So, they had a meeting, decided you oughta have fun while you're in town. Sort of like you was on furlough here. That's real nice of the boys. Who are they? I didn't ask. [ Ace ] Come on, Con. Let's go. Wait a minute. How much? $2,000. Fella could have a real nice furlough on that. Yeah. That's the way they figured it. Jim's waiting for you down at the Palace. I'll be along. Good. I'll tell him. 209. Oh, say. Ain't you the soldier fella that checked in around noon? Yeah. Well, why ain't you wearing your uniform? I deserted. I thought you were sent down here to clean up the town. That's why I deserted. I like the town the way it is. Sergeant Harder. I'm Judge Pierce. I met you down at the depot when you arrived this morning. Yes, sir. I thought I'd drop by and apologize. Why? If we're to accomplish anything, we have to work together. And it'll be easier on all of us if we can work on friendly terms. I'd be pleased if you could meet with us in the mayor's office this evening. Long as you put it that way, Judge, I don't see how I could refuse. I'll expect you then. [ Snoring ] [ Snoring Continues ] Anybody home? Hey! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Things are a little quiet. I was catching up on my rest. I walk in my sleep, you know. Oh. Business pretty slow, huh? Slow? I ain't had a prisoner in this jail for three months. Sounds like a law-abiding town. Well, depends which law you're referring to. Most of 'em are abiding by the law of self-preservation. Can't blame a man for that. Nope. Been abiding by it myself. There's maybe eight or 10 people in this town... like to see it run according to the rules. But there's maybe eight or 10 hundred who wouldn't. I know when I'm outnumbered. I'm Jeff Harder. Oh, I'm Orrie Sommers, town marshal. Already heard of you. Friend of Shanessy's, ain't you? Mmm, could be. Well, you'll live longer that way. Suppose you'll be making your headquarters here? Imagine so. I'll put a blanket on one of them empty bunks in back. Find it real restful during the day. That'll be nice. Orrie, put a blanket on all of 'em. We may be drumming up some business. Yeah? ♪♪ [ Honky-tonk Piano ] [ Chattering ] [ Laughing ] Whiskey, mister? Got anything else? Beer. Whiskey will do. I made that myself, first thing this morning. Always this busy around here? Oh, this is dull. But you come around tonight. Shanessy around? He's upstairs in his office. You're making me curious, boys. When do I get to meet this character? I still say it's a waste of money. Why don't we just run him out of town? He won't give us any trouble. Besides, he doesn't run very good. I could teach him. Do me a favor and sign your insurance over to me just before you try. [ Knocking On Door ] Oh, Jeff, come on in. We've been waiting for you. You met Con and Ace. This is Lou Carter, my manager. Jim doesn't speak English very well. What he meant to say was I'm his partner. How 'bout a drink, soldier? If it's better than what you serve downstairs. Ask for my special bottle the next time you come in. [ Shanessy ] What do you think of the town? It's changed some since I saw it last. It'll quiet down when the end of the track moves out west. When's that gonna be, Jim? Who knows? Thanks. Here's luck. I make my own luck. They take care of you all right down at the hotel? A little better than I expected. Mmm. You know what the penalty for trying to bribe a federal officer is? No. Three years. [ Shanessy ] Why tell me? I don't think you'd like it in jail. Are you gonna arrest me? No. You take that job pretty serious, don't you? Funny thing about that. I didn't ask for it. I don't want it. But as long as I'm marshal I'm gonna do everything that's expected of me. I'm not asking for any favors. You're not buying any either. You've got me all wrong, Jeff. Why not keep the money, as a gift? Somebody might get the wrong ideas. [ Chuckles ] I might get 'em myself. [ Chuckles ] Sure, sure. How 'bout another drink? You couldn't get any ideas about that. Not the same ideas. I'll listen. Better wait till I know you better. Anytime. Now, how about that drink? Some other time. See you around, Jim. So long, yellow-ling. I don't mind some people calling me that. [ Shanessy ] Sit down, Ace. You're not one of them. You don't scare me, soldier. Get out of town or I'll come looking for you. [ Gunshot ] Keep him away from me, Jim, or I'll hang him up to dry. Did I hear somebody say he wouldn't cause any trouble? [ Chattering ] [ Exhales ] Does it taste better now? [ Gasps ] In another 10 or 15 minutes it might be fit to drink. Jeff, I'm going out to the house. Would you like to come along? Sure. Where'd you meet your partner? In Denver. She was stranded there with a troupe of girls. Strictly business, huh? What else would it be? I can think of a lot of things. I was under the impression you'd already thought of it. As long as she's not your girl. You forget I'm married, Jeff. I didn't forget it. I thought maybe you had. This is it. A little different from the three rooms you had the last time I saw you. You either go backwards or forward. You can't stand still. I don't know. I manage pretty well. I was a sergeant five years ago. [ Laughing ] Helen! Step in, Jeff. Helen? Jim? What are you doing home this time of day? I thought you might like to meet an old friend. Jeff. Jefferson Harder. Hello, Helen. It's good to see you again. He's our new marshal. Been put on detached service by General Augur to, uh, clean up Laramie. Doesn't sound too hard, with Jim's help here. He seems to be a pretty important man in town. Why-- Oh, yes. I suppose he is. I don't pay too much attention to Jim's business. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll see if I can rustle up a drink. Well, it's been about five years since I last saw you, Jeff. They've been good to you. Have they? Oh, I'm not feeling sorry for myself. Wanna talk about it? Does it do any good? Sometimes. [ Chuckles ] Poor Jeff. You've spent most of your life listening to my troubles. I have no complaints. Just for a change, why don't you tell me yours. I haven't got any. Don't be too sure about that, Jeff. Jim said you were sent here to clean up Laramie. That's right. That means you clean up Jim. He runs it. Maybe he's more important than I thought he was. He is. How do you feel about it? It's not important how I feel about it, Jeff. Might be... to me. Jim's changed a lot, Jeff. He's-- He's not the same person we used to know. I've noticed that. He used to get mad every time I looked at you. [ Helen Chuckles ] Well, here we are. And believe me, Jeff, it's a little older than what I sell. [ Chuckling ] And when we heard the railroad was going to build through here, Jim saw a chance to make some money, a lot of money. What's wrong with that? Nothing. Except it also made me a lot of enemies. Will you stay for dinner? I'm sorry. I can't, Jim. I have a date with Judge Pierce. Oh. Give him my regards. I'll do that. Good-bye, Helen. Good-bye, Jeff. Come again soon. Thanks. Sorry you can't stay. We'll see you tomorrow. A very touching reunion. Jeff always was fond of me. That's exactly why I brought him out here. I know. I think he's still in love with me. how one man...at I fail to e can cope with the situation, especially in view of the fact... that he happens to be your friend. Naturally you'd be reluctant to see any harm come to him. What do you want me to do? Kill him? The idea's appealing. Unfortunately it's against the law. How far beyond the town do the rails go? Five Mile Camp. Work has been at a standstill out there for the past six weeks. Who's your construction boss? A man named Murphy. Pike Murphy. Can't he keep his crew in line? Either he can't or he doesn't want to. You can always fire him. Who do you think we'd get to take his place? They're all alike. None of 'em are worth their salt. I'd like to ask a question, Mr. Graham. How much authority do I have on this job? My instructions from General Augur... were to allow you to take whatever steps you consider necessary... to correct the situation. Mm-hmm. Where will I find Pike Murphy? At Five Mile Camp. There will be a work train going up there in the morning. Thanks. Good night, gentlemen. [ Train Whistle Blowing ] Hide that bottle, Dutch. The super must be on board. They don't blow that whistle any other time. He can't do nothing. You heard me. Ditch it. The rest of you, grab a shovel and act like you're working. Hey, wake up over there. We gotta go back to work. [ Bell Clanging ] Want a ride back? We'll be leaving as soon as they unload those supplies. Don't be in a hurry. You're gonna have some passengers on the way back. Boys are a little careless with their tools. Any of your business? Could be. I'm looking for Pike Murphy. You can stop looking. I'm Murphy. Then get your gear. You're through. What do you mean? You're fired. Who are you? My name's Harder. I'm the new marshal. I take my orders from Graham. You take 'em from me. If you don't think so, try drawing any pay tomorrow. Or any day after, for that matter. I guess you must be the new troubleshooter Augur sent down from Cheyenne. I'm under the general's orders, yes. I'll give you a little advice. Get out of camp before you find more trouble than you bargained for. We like taking care of gents like you. Do you do it yourself, Pike, or, uh, do you need help? Doesn't matter much either way. In your case I'd like to do it myself. [ Grunts ] It's an open game, boys. All or any part. [ All Muttering ] [ Chattering ] [ Chattering ] Who owns this setup? I run it. Under lease. Your lease just expired. I'll give you 24 hours to get the liquor and the gambling spreads... off of railroad property. Think my boss will have something to say about that. Who is your boss? That's none of your business. I'm making it my business. Tell him he can look me up at the marshal's office in Laramie. Or he can meet me here tomorrow. Because if the liquor isn't gone by then, I'm gonna personally break every bottle in the bar. You don't have to worry about getting rid of it, Johnny. We can drink it up by then. [ Laughing ] Take my advice. Don't sell it on credit. Because nobody in this camp's got a job anymore. What are you talkin' about? Construction on this job is closed down. Anyone got any money coming, he can pick it up at the pay office in Laramie. Meantime, you're trespassing on railroad property. Be off by sundown. Who does he think he is? [ Chattering ] [ Chattering ] [ Man ] I found out from another man. [ Chattering Continues ] He can't do that. Looks to me like he's already done it. I'm headin' for the pay office. Gentlemen, it's unfair to the merchants. And if you ask me, I don't see that this is any solution to the problem. It's the most high-handed action I ever heard of. Why, Laramie will be a ghost town in a month. Wait till General Augur hears about this. I was under the impression that you were the superintendent... in charge of construction, Mr. Graham. I am. Then you mean you take the responsibility for this? No. Get in touch with the other members of the council. Tell them there will be a meeting at 7:00 this evening at community hall. I didn't know what to do about that liquor, Mr. Shanessy. It's a job to bring it into town, but he said he'd bust every bottle. I think he means it. I think he does too. Take some of the boys, Johnny, and bring it in. Sure. I'll go with you. Just in case the sergeant gives you any trouble. You gettin' tired of living? He's got the Indian sign on you too. I heard what he done to Pike Murphy. That's enough proof for me. He is good with his hands. I wonder how he is with a gun. Relax, Ace. We don't want any trouble with Harder. You gonna let him get away with it? Yes. When I threw in with you on this deal, I figured you were man enough to back your own play. I am. And I'll play it my way. You're getting trigger-happy and too big for your britches. What I ought to do is let Harder kill you, except it would interfere with my plans. [ Gun Cocks ] [ Shanessy ] Don't try it, Ace. You make one move and Con will blow a hole in you big enough to walk through. Now go on downstairs and cool off. Let me know when you get back to town, Johnny. Yeah. Sure, Mr. Shanessy. Con, did you say there was a meeting of the town council tonight? That's right. Find out what goes on. Any messages for me, pop? Yes. One in writing from Mr. Graham. And 30 or 40 more, word of mouth. Remember any of 'em? Remember 'em all. -That's quite an accomplishment. -It wasn't hard. All said the same thing-- "Get outta town." How do you feel on the subject? Well, I wouldn't say yes and I wouldn't say no. Uh, you could do me a favor though. What's that? Well, uh, next time we have a conversation, stand about 10 feet away. Some of the people in this town ain't very accurate shooters. [ Chattering ] This meeting will now come to order. Sergeant Harder, as Mr. Graham has told you, this meeting was called to discuss the possible results of your arbitrary action... in shutting down construction on the K.T.& C. Railroad. Is there anything you'd like to say? I'll listen to what they have to say. You'll listen, all right! [ All Shouting ] [ Gavel Rapping ] [ Pierce ] Quiet, gentlemen. Quiet! This meeting will be conducted in an orderly manner, or we'll adjourn right now. Mr. Chairman! [ Pierce ] Mr. Grimes. It was my understanding the sergeant was sent down here to clean this town up... so the railroad could keep building. The first thing he does is stop construction, the very thing Shanessy and his gang have been trying to do for weeks. Maybe he could explain that. [ Muttering ] I think I can, Mr. Grimes. I was told to shut down the gambling and drinking... because the construction crews weren't getting any work done. All right. I'll guarantee you in two weeks... there'll be no more gambling or drinking. In two weeks there won't be a railroad worker left in this town. Maybe not. But if there are and they want to go back to work, they'll go back to work, on my terms. What's going to happen to the honest merchants in the meantime? [ Jeff ] Honest merchants? I don't think there's an honest merchant in the house. [ Muttering ] You're not interested in building a railroad or a town. You're no better than the gamblers and saloon keepers you're trying to get rid of. All you're interested in doing is unloading your merchandise. [ All Protesting ] [ Gavel Rapping ] [ Pierce ] Order, gentlemen. Order! [ Gavel Rapping ] Quiet! I'm quite sure, Sergeant, that when General Augur gave you this assignment... he hadn't contemplated the drastic measures you're attempting. I'm sure there must be some other way. Mr. Graham, you wanted me to do a job. I'll do the job my own way. Are we to understand that you intend going through with this idiotic scheme? Yes, sir. I'm warning you. [ Gavel Raps ] Mr. Higby, I will not countenance personal threats... in any way meeting in which I'm serving as chairman. Mr. Chairman, I move a committee be appointed... to present this matter to General Augur in person... with the recommendation that Harder be prosecuted by a military court. [ Chattering ] [ Gavel Rapping ] Now, before this motion is put to a vote, I'd like to propose an amendment. The sergeant has some justification for his stand. He mentioned a period of two weeks. None of you can be hurt in that time. I suggest that we allow him this trial period before taking any action. That's all right to me! Why should we wait? We know what's going to happen! - I say, do it tomorrow! - Give the man a chance! Will anyone second the motion as amended? I'll second it. Those in favor? [ Together ] Aye. Opposed? [ Scattered Voices ] No. Motion approved. [ Chattering ] Thanks for the vote of confidence, gentlemen. Looks like we got those merchants working for us. Most of 'em wanted to run him out of town. But they ended up giving him two weeks. Figured he couldn't starve anybody out in that time. Maybe we can help him. Help him? Thought you wanted to get rid of him. I do. Pass the word around-- no more credit at the bars or the tables. What do you want to do that for, Jim? Look, you short those railroad workers on their whiskey, they're gonna get mad. [ Chuckles ] You catch on real quick, Con. I hope you know what you're doing. Don't try to figure it out. Just stop the credit. All right. [ Chattering ] Give me a bottle, two glasses. Got any money? I don't need any money. My word's good. Not anymore, it isn't. Who says? The boss. You mean I can't get a drink in this joint unless I pay cash? That's the general idea. Lay it on the line or go thirsty. Kings over. Three aces. [ Chuckles ] The Hawk's got him again. I can't win a hand. Give me a marker for a hundred. There's no jawbone in this game, Pike. Come on. Give me a hundred. You know I'm good for it. Tell it to Shanessy. He's the one that stopped the credit. I've been talking to some of the boys. None of us got any money. Railroad man can't even get a drink in this town without cash. Why tell me about it? I understand you're the one that shut down our credit. That's right. We played along with you. Now we're starting to wonder when you're going to do something for us. I didn't close down construction, Pike, and I can't open it up. Well, what are we supposed to do? [ Chuckles ] I can think of a couple of things. [ Chuckles ] So can I. Starve, or leave town. Oh, we can do better than that. How? Get your crew down here tonight and I'll let you know. We'll be here. I thought Harder was a friend of yours. He is. So you're gonna turn that mob loose on him. Not unless I have to. You'd throw me to the wolves too, wouldn't you? If you ever got in my way. Mm-mmm. I'm too smart for that, Jim. [ Shanessy ] Come in, boys. All of you, come on in. Just step up to the bar and have a drink. Drinks are on the house. On me. Just step right up. Boy, that news travels fast. You too, Billy. Come on in, boys. Right up to the bar and have a drink. Absolutely free. Nothing to pay for. The drinks are on the house. Just step right up to the bar and order anything you want. Anything. Come in. You too, Joe. Step up there. Have a drink. Step up, boys. Come on. Step up. Who's chasing you? Nobody yet. Help me get these loaded. Move this desk over there. Hold it. Hold it. What's all the excitement about? I just come by the Palace. There's maybe a hundred railroad men in there. Shanessy's buying 'em all drinks on the house. They get drunk enough, they're bound to come looking for you. I see. Where you going? Down to the Palace. Maybe they'll buy me a drink on the house. Why don't you just shoot yourself right here and save all that walking? I don't think they're that tough, Orrie. You don't? You ain't scared? A little. Let's go. Hold it. You don't have to go. I know. That's what I don't understand about myself. But it looks like I'm going anyway. I won't take up much of your time, boys. I know you're all broke and mad about being out of a job. And I'm a little mad about it myself. If you're working, I make money. If you're not working, I wind up giving away free whiskey, and there's no profit in that. [ Laughing ] You all got a raw deal from the company, and you're gonna keep on getting it if you don't do something about it. [ Crowd Murmuring ] You know who's responsible for the shutdown. Are you gonna let a few men starve you to death without doing anything about it? - [ Crowd Muttering ] - What do you want us to do about it? [ Pike ] Shut up and listen a minute. The railroad's got a lot of money tied up here in material and equipment. If some of it should burn some night, or a few cars get blown off the track, they might begin to realize that you mean business. [ Jeff ] You might get in some trouble too. I'm glad you dropped in, Marshal. I was, uh, about to make a speech. You just made it. You men know as well as I do why you're not working. Anytime you want to do a day's work for a day's pay, let me know. Now break it up! [ Crowd Muttering ] We're going for a walk, Jim. Where to? Jail. What's the charge? Inciting to riot. You're wasting your time, Jeff. It's my time. Do I get a jury trial? That's what the law says. When? Anytime you want. Let's go. Take him down and lock him up, Orrie. I'll be along. I'll buy you a drink. I could use it. Someplace where we can talk. ke . Thanks. A fella could spend a real enjoyable evening here. The invitation's been open. That's what I can't figure out. I just threw your partner in jail. He had it coming to him. That sounds odd to you, doesn't it? Well, I must admit it's not quite what I expected. How far does this partnership go? The saloon and the money it makes. Does Jim feel the same way about it? Money's the only thing we have in common. The difference is, he doesn't care how he makes his. I do. [ Chuckles ] You're a remarkable woman, Lou. At least I'm honest in my own way. I sell whiskey for what it's worth and the games are straight. That's where Jim and I differ in policy. How long do you think you're gonna keep him in jail? That depends on the judge and the jury. No jury in this town's gonna convict him. Gotta be 12 honest people around here someplace. They may be honest, but they're scared. It adds up to the same thing. Looks like Jim's got everything pretty well wrapped up. I'd like to help you unwrap it. I don't make bargains. I wasn't offering one. Thanks for the drink. [ Door Rattling ] Who is it? Jeff. Oh. Wait. I'll unlock it. Expecting trouble? I wasn't expecting friends. Orrie, are you for me or against me? Huh? Uncock that cannon before you blow my head off. I forgot I was carrying it. Prisoner had anything to eat? No. I didn't think it was safe to leave him alone. Better get him something. Everything all right, Jim? No complaints. I am running a little short on cigars though. I'll have Orrie get you some. I'm sorry it had to end up this way. Well, I been in jails before. As a matter of fact, I seem to remember that you were in 'em along with me. This is different. I'm not worried. What do you expect to get out of all this? Money. Guy like you could make it on the level. Not as much. Or as fast. How about Helen? She won't get hurt. I've been real good to her, Jeff. Do me a favor? Tell her I'm in the jug. I don't want her to worry. I'll take care of it. [ Door Opens, Closes ] Who is it? It's Jeff. Oh. Just a minute. Come on in, Jeff. Jim isn't home, but I expect him any minute. He won't be home tonight, Helen. I just left him. He's in trouble. Is he hurt? No, he's in jail. I wish you hadn't done that, Jeff. I tried to warn him. Don't misunderstand me. I'm only afraid of what might happen to you now. Oh, it's not that serious. He was trying to stir up trouble with the railroaders. I thought if I put him in jail it'd give him a chance to cool off, think it over. I'd like to think that would help, but I'm afraid it won't. Helen, if he keeps on this way-- I know. You happy with him? I'm married to him, Jeff. No matter what he does, that's something I can't escape. I made my choice. I'll keep my part of the bargain. I see. May I see him, Jeff? Not tonight. Tomorrow. Good night, Helen. Good night, Jeff. [ Door Opens, Closes ] You'd better hurry up with your shaving. It's almost time for the trial. Where's Jeff? I guess he had business someplace. I ain't seen him since last night. Be too bad if he missed the trial. They might need his testimony. I was there. That's right. You were, weren't ya? Did you ever see a man get his throat cut with one of these, Orrie? No. Can't say I have. It's awful messy. I don't think you'd like it. No, I don't think I-- [ Mirror Shatters ] [ Whistle Blowing ] Marshal! Shut 'er down and get me back to Laramie. Sure. I thought you were supposed to be in court. That's where we're going. [ Spectators Murmuring ] Wonder what happened to Harder. That's what I'd like to know. [ Pierce ] This court will now come to order. Lend me your knife, Orrie. [ Gavel Bangs ] [ Pierce ] Will the arresting officer please take the stand. Your Honor, I regret to inform the court... the arresting officer is not present. [ Spectators Murmuring ] [ Pierce ] Are there any other witnesses for the prosecution? Your knife. [ Prosecutor ] No other witnesses, Your Honor. Your Honor, since no evidence has been offered by the prosecution, I move for dismissal of the case. I have no choice but to dismiss the case. [ Gavel Bangs ] [ Pierce ] Court's adjourned. [ Spectators Murmuring ] [ Steam Hisses ] Judge Pierce! You're a little late, Marshal. We could have used your testimony. Or is that the way you had planned it? You ain't gonna turn that in, are ya? No. But it's pretty plain that's what a lot of people would like me to do. It's still all my fault. I could've testified, but that Ace and Con were sitting right behind me and I... just lost my nerve. Don't worry about it, Orrie. I don't think they'd have convicted him anyway. Maybe not, but they gotta hang this whole thing on somebody, and-- And I'm it. Yes, I know. What'll you do now? Only one thing to do. Let's take a walk. [ Door Opens ] You still open for business? [ Jeff ] Come in. Excuse me. I'll meet you later. All right, Orrie. You weren't at the trial today. I was out of town. That's what I heard. You know what's gonna happen now? I've got a fair idea. This town's gonna blow wide open. How would you know? You can hear a lot of things around the saloon. My offer to help is still good. Just what is your interest in all this? Personal. [ Door Closes ] Gather round. Shanessy just gave us the go-ahead. He wants Five Mile burned and all the rolling stock put out of commission. And stay out of that marshal's way if you wanna stay healthy. [ Chuckles ] You oughta know, Pike. You all know what you're supposed to do. Here's a key to the dynamite house. And don't be bashful about using it. It ain't costin' anything. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. Something I can do for you, Marshal? Send that message through to General Augur in Cheyenne. Yeah. "Need a crew of 200 railroad workers... or 12 men to sit on a jury. Neither available, request I be recalled from this assignment. Signed, Harder." That'll be a dollar, Marshal. Not quite as sure of yourself... as when you first came here, are you? Just send the message. Yes, sir. Deliver it right away. Of course you didn't send it. Nope. I didn't figure you'd want me to. Here. Buy yourself a cigar on the way out. Thanks, Mr. Shanessy. Oh, one thing I had in mind. If he don't get an answer, he's apt to take it into his head to go to Cheyenne personally. When's the next train going there? Well, if they stay on schedule there'll be one tomorrow. Mm-hmm. Thanks. [ Clicking ] [ Telegraph Clicking ] [ Clicking ] [ Clicking Stops ] I suppose you know why we're here. I can guess. Mr. Harder, much against our better judgment, we agreed to cooperate with you on this idiotic plan you proposed... to force these men to work. At this point it must be clear even to you... that you have failed. The only thing you've done is to stir them up to a point... where our property and homes are endangered. Now, we demand you rehire them immediately! No. What's your objection? You want to build a railroad, don't you? Show weakness to these men, and you'll never get it done. [ Pierce ] But it isn't safe for decent people to appear on the streets. Whose fault is that, Judge? I've arrested a dozen men in the last week, and you've turned them loose. What do you want me to do? We've already told you. Put these men back to work. And the answer is still the same. In that case, Sergeant, you leave us only one alternative. I'm telegraphing General Augur to request your immediate dismissal. In addition, I feel it's my duty to file charges against you. Good day! Mr. Graham! Mr. Graham, I've been looking all over town for you. What's wrong? Somebody dynamited the Cheyenne Hill. There's a landslide on the tracks. Take a least a couple weeks to clear it. Did you notify General Augur? No, sir. I didn't notify anybody. Why not? Well, whoever did the dynamiting also cut the telegraph lines. That comes in pretty handy for you, doesn't it, Marshal? Gentlemen, gentlemen! I think the only thing to do is rehire some of the old men for an emergency crew. I wouldn't hire one of those men back for anything. If you want a message through to the general, write it out. I'll deliver it for you. I'm afraid we couldn't trust you, Marshal. Under the circumstances, I prefer you remain in town. Suit yourself. Mr. Sommers, do you think you could make it through to Cheyenne? Yeah, if I don't run into Indians. Is it all right for me to go, Jeff? Sure, Orrie, but... take care of yourself. Meet me in my office as soon as you're ready to leave. [ Murmuring ] This time do it your way, Ace. [ Hammer Cocks ] [ Gunshot ] Come on in, Jeff. Make yourself at home. Thanks. You don't mind my dropping in like this? It's your hotel. I would've come down to your office, but I thought we could talk better here. What have we got to talk about? Your future. I'll take care of my future. You look out for your own. Mine never looked brighter. And it could include you. You know me better than that, Jim. I heard what happened. You're all through here. Maybe as far as Graham's concerned. I figure I got some unfinished business... with you. Use your head, Jeff. Finish your hitch in the army and come on back here. I can always use good men. Like Con and Ace? They come in handy at times. What's this for? That's for the room. I don't wanna throw you out as long as you're still paying for it. Have it your way. I hope you change your mind. Whoa, Rusty. [ Nickering ] Whoa, boy. Whoa, Rusty. Whoa. [ Knocking ] Come in. Marshal. What's the trouble, Hank? I just found Orrie Sommers's horse. There's blood on the saddle. I should have known. Fix me up a rig. I'll see if I can find the doctor. Ho! Take him down to the undertaker's. And, Doc, tell him to stay open. All right, Jeff. Giddap. Looking for somebody, soldier? You oughta know. Maybe I do. Sit down. Some other time. Let's make it now. I want to talk to you. Sorry. They killed Orrie Sommers, didn't they? What do you know about Orrie? Nothing. Except what I can figure out for myself. Who did it? Where is he? Upstairs. Thanks. Jeff. Don't kill him. That's the way Shanessy runs this town. What would you like me to do? Arrest him so a jury of 12 good men can turn him loose? But they don't have to be men. What are you talking about? Look it up in your territorial constitution. Women can vote. They can serve on juries. It's the first time they've been given equal rights anywhere in this country. I'll tell Shanessy... you made your speech real good. Maybe I don't like murder any more than you do. Hold it, Sergeant. You have to go through me to see Shanessy. Yeah, I know. Ah, Jeff. We were just having a nightcap. Will you join us? Next time you bushwhack somebody, shoot the horse too. I don't know what you're talking about. I just brought Orrie Sommers back into town. I didn't know he'd been gone. Come on. I'm taking you in. What for? Murder. I didn't kill Orrie. How did you know he was dead? You think you can make that stick with a jury? I don't know. But I'm making you a promise. If the jury don't hang you, I will. Come on. Well, drink up, Ace. [ Gunshot ] Saves the town the cost of a trial. No, it doesn't, Jim. They're gonna try you instead. You gave the orders. You can't prove that. Maybe I can. Women jurors. Next thing you know, they'll have a woman judge. Yeah, and a woman mayor! [ All Laughing ] Why don't you ladies go home! Go on home with your petticoats where you belong! Yeah! Where's your old man? Home taking care of the kids? We know who you are. Where's your old man? [ Men Chattering, Jeering ] Oh, a petticoat jury! Oh, Mr. Grimes. Yes? You'd better tell those female jurors to acquit Jim Shanessy. Yeah, or there'll be 12 new widows in town tomorrow. Go on. [ Spectators Murmuring ] [ Rapping ] Uh, Your Honor. I move that all women summoned as jurors be excused. That's right! That's a man's job! [ Shouting, Murmuring ] [ Gavel Rapping ] [ Pierce ] Motion denied. [ Jeering, Shouting ] [ Gavel Rapping ] [ Pike ] That's a man's job! This court will come to order! Your Honor, the jury is now impaneled. Swear them in. If you will please rise and raise your right hands. [ Bailiff ] You and each of you do solemnly swear... that you will well and truly try the cause now pending before the court... and a true verdict render therein, according to the evidence and instructions of the court, so help you, God. Ladies, look this way, please, so the world can see what the first woman jury looks like. I rented Orrie the horse. Then three or four hours later he came back all by himself. I thought at first maybe Orrie had just got throwed. Then I saw the blood on the saddle. Come to think of it, I never got paid for the horse either. Death due to gunshot wounds... and associated hemorrhage. He was shot twice with a large-caliber gun. It was right after Mr. Sommers left. Shanessy and Ace were standing there... and Shanessy said, "This time you do it your way, Ace." I didn't think anything of it at the time. Having heard the evidence, you will retire now to reach a verdict. Bailiff, make sure that no one communicates with them. [ Spectators Murmuring ] This court will recess for one hour. [ Laughing ] The way women talk, this could go on for a week. What difference does it make, with Lou on the jury? That's right. She's not gonna let anything happen to Jim. Jury's coming in! [ All Shouting ] Let's go. [ Spectators Murmuring, Chattering ] [ Gavel Bangs ] [ Pierce ] Members of the jury, have you reached a verdict? We have, Your Honor. We, the members of the jury, find the defendant... guilty as charged. [ Spectators Murmuring, Chattering ] [ Knocking ] Who is it? It's Jeff. May I come in? The door's open. I wouldn't work downstairs tonight if I were you. Why not? Shanessy's got too many friends down there. You don't hire friendship. Call 'em anything you like. They still figure you're responsible for Jim's conviction. There were 11 other women on the jury. Sure. I know. But they didn't stand a chance to gain what you did. Get out. Not until I say what I came to say. You've said too much already. Do you think I'd see a man get hung for a half-interest in a saloon? Of course I don't. But I know some people who do. I don't care what they think. Listen, Lou. It took a lot of courage for you to do what you did today. I came to say thank you. I didn't expect any thanks. What did you expect? Nothing from you. I just want to be able to live with myself. Guess I'd better be going. Jeff? Why did you come here? I told you. I wasn't because you-- you thought I was still trying to make a bargain? No, Lou. Well, why didn't you say that... when you first came in? [ Chuckles ] You know, the general always said I wasn't very smart. [ Laughs ] Just wanted to make sure the rope don't break. Going to a lot of trouble, aren't they? There are plenty of trees around. Council figured that kind of hanging ain't human. That's real thoughtful of 'em. What time does the party start? Noon tomorrow. Better get a good night's sleep. [ All Laughing ] Sorry, ma'am. No one allowed in here. The marshal's orders. Would you tell the marshal I'd like to see him? It's all right, Morgan. We're not letting Jim talk to anyone, Helen. But, Jeff, I have to talk to him. This is my last chance. I suppose so. Come on. I don't know how to thank you, Jeff. Don't try. I'm just sorry it all had to happen. Jim. Did you do what they told you? Yes. Give it to me. I could get in a lot of trouble, Jim. You don't want me in jail too, do you? It's the only chance I've got. I didn't have anything to do with that killing. Lou Carter railroaded me. I promise you, Helen, if I get out of this, we'll go someplace and start over. California, maybe. You'd like California. But I don't know if I can believe you, Jim. You've gotta believe me. They're gonna hang me tomorrow. Don't you understand? They're gonna hang me. You want that on your conscience? All right. I believe you. Hey, Jeff. What is it, Jim? Can I have a drink of water before you lock up? Sure. How about a little whiskey for a chaser? Sorry. The bar is closed. Don't start yelling, Jeff. It'll be the last sound you ever make. Open the door. You know I'm coming after you. Come on. Get inside. Jim! [ Hammer Cocks ] Surprised to see me, Lou? You should have known I'd come after you. I told you once what'd happen if you ever tried to cross me. But I didn't double-cross you, Jim. You did it to yourself. You coulda hung that jury. They preferred to hang you. You'll never live long enough to see it, Lou. [ Gunshot ] [ Man ] What's going on up there? [ People Chattering ] [ Man ] What happened? Somebody get a doctor! Lou. Lou! Who shot you? Shanessy. Shanessy broke jail! He shot Lou! [ PeopleMarshal!ing ] Shanessy just shot Lou Carter! Round up all the men you can find. Hurry. We've had men posted all over town. Nobody's left on horseback. He wouldn't travel on foot through Indian country, so that means he's still here. Split up in groups of four. Start a house-to-house search. Mr. Graham, I'd appreciate it if you'd stay with me. [ Knocking ] [ Door Opens ] Jeff! Where is Jim, Helen? Jim? I-Isn't he still in jail? You oughta know. You brought him that gun. Jeff. Let him go. For my sake let him go, Jeff. You can stop acting, Helen. It won't work anymore. Let's search the house. He's not here. I tell you, I don't know where he is, Jeff! I give you my word! Brought you some food. Thanks. Everything all set? All set, Mr. Shanessy. There's a work train due to leave tomorrow at daylight for the slide area. They'll have to stop here for orders. Good. [ Bell Clanging ] [ Steam Hissing ] [ Telegraph Clicking ] [ Clicking ] [ Clicking Continues ] Get over there. In the corner! Wait! Come back! The slide's been cleared! There's a passenger train headed this way! Come back! Keep him here. I'll get the marshal. [ Bell Clanging ] Marshal, we've checked every house, barn and woodshed in this town. We can't find hide nor hair of him. He must have tried to get away on foot. Get your horses and meet me back here. Marshal! Marshal! Shanessy and Winton just stole the work train. They can't get past the slide. Let's go. The slide's been cleared. There's a passenger train headed this way from Cheyenne. [ Graham ] Don't just stand there! Get on your horses and give him some help! Come on, boys! [ Men Chattering ] Go back and get him, Con. [ Screams ] [ Bell Clanging ] We're losing pressure. Better check the steam. [ Grunts ] Train coming! [ Whistle Blowing ] I'd better catch that train if I'm gonna report back to the army. How long does that last? Six months. Then what? I've spent so much time in saloons, I always thought I'd like to own one. I know one for sale cheap. Of course I'd have to have terms. On this one you could write your own. Maybe we should come to some agreement. Maybe we should. Just remember those trains run both ways.
