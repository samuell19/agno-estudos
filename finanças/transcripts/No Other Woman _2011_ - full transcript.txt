You encounter a lot of people every day. Pretend you're not interested. So steep? 80,000 pesos for a sexy chair? And once you finally get her, I tell you. Just like when you pick up a girl. So that's why you're such a good salesman. You use being a womanizer to your advantage. Bro, I'm not a womanizer. You? Bro. Are you saying that since the day you married Charmaine, you've never cheated? When you get married, Really now? -Hi. Ram Escaler. -Ito Dela Cruz. But most of our furniture here is... Living room? Actually, it's for an entire resort. we don't see each other anymore. -Busy, I suppose? -Maybe. until he cheated me in our business. It's a very beautiful resort. Clear water, white sand. The hotel is quite spacious, too. From what I gather, during the peak season it costs 50,000 pesos per night per person. Really? Why don't you invite me and your father-in-law? Fifty-thousand pesos? Who in his right mind would waste 50,000 pesos just to swim at the beach? They're all the same. Dad, don't be so negative. As for me, love, I'm excited for your project. I hope you seal the deal. I'm going back there next week for another inspection. I'll see if I can bring you with me. -Sure. -Why? Why do you have to keep going back there, Ram? How many times do you have to keep going back there, to know how many chairs and tables you're going to supply? Enough with the speeches. Let's just enjoy our dinner, OK? Don't mind him. That's just the way he is. How can I not mind him, hon? This house was his wedding gift to us, but I've never felt that it was ours. Everything comes from your dad. Sometimes, I feel like I'm being emasculated. The problem with your dad is that even now, he has no trust in me. He's never going to like me. Enough, love. Is this how we're going to be every night? -Hello. -Yes, Jake? Grandpa had another stroke. He wants you to visit him. What? -Where's your dad? -He's out. Gramps, when are we playing golf again? You should see me play now. I score single digits now. Next time, I'll be able to give you a plus. Ram... I'm dying. I hope you patch things up with your dad. What's this? That's for Grandpa. -I don't need this. -I know you don't. It's for Grandpa. What are you trying to prove? That you're rich? That you're a big shot now? I'm not a big shot, Dad! I just want to show you that I'm not like you! I'm not going to abandon my family. Of course, I'm just going to wear something simple. I don't want to outshine my mother-in-law. It's their 50th wedding anniversary. Congressman Chavez will be there. They have to be seated up front. That's why they keep saying we're nouveau riche. -Nouveau! -Ouch! What's wrong with being surrounded by gold and imported things? Nouveau! They're just envious! -Nouveau... -Hand me those shoes. -They're golden. -Dad... Please... how are we going to reach our 50th wedding anniversary like Grandpa and Grandma if you keep being like that with Ram? Dad, please. Enough with Ram. Thank you, Dad. -Yes? -I have a meeting with Mr. Zalderiaga. You're that guy from Costa Luz. that we will supply the furniture for his new resort. Mr. Escaler, people don't go on vacation to witness an art exhibit. what's their reason for going to our resort? To swim? Of course they're going to swim. A cheaper resort. We're very expensive. Yes, we're expensive, Ms. Kara. -Forget it. -Please. He doesn't normally meet his suppliers. In fact, I myself, am having a hard time to even set an appointment with my own father. I hope so. No, this is my treat. So, what... -Ma, let's go! Hurry! -Hello, Ram. Where are you? I've been calling you. Well, hurry up. They're all pressuring me here. We'll go ahead. Hon, I'm sorry. Love, please wear this. Hon, you know I don't wear this when I'm with my clients. Please don't get mad. Sister, Mom wants to see you. -Mom, what happened? -Look at your father! He better not dare come in here or I'll kick him in the balls! Mom! Calm down. For all you know, that's not his mistress. She might be his business partner. Business partner? Look at her! I'm going to give that girl a bitch slap! I know that kind of woman. And I know she's been crazy about your dad for a while now! If she's a python, then I'm a cobra! I'm quiet, but when I'm pissed, I bite! Especially you, Cha. A lot of women are salivating over your husband. But, when another woman comes into the picture... OK, keep it low. Keep your arm straight. And I'm not planning on falling in love with you. So are you saying it's OK-- I'm sketching some designs your dad wants me to do. Just keep it simple. Not too much... -I love seafood. -Looks like you're enjoying it. Why are you using a knife and fork? I can't. How can you enjoy eating this if you're not going to use your hands? Fine. Happy? Look at me. I'm not allowed to eat this, but I'm enjoying it. Why aren't you allowed to? You know-- I'm not afraid of an allergic reaction. If I just accept that I'm not allowed it... how am I going to know that it tastes good? Even if it's forbidden, you should fight that. -You want tea? I made you some tea. -OK. Did it help? I can take care of myself. Next time, when it's forbidden, it's forbidden. -You're home. -You're still awake. Are you hungry? I cooked your favorite. Excuse me, let me just heat your food. So even if you're married, that's fine with Kara? Yes, the deal is clear. Wait, I thought you were a faithful husband. What's this now? A word of caution, my friend. You might not know what you're getting yourself into. Everything in this world seems good at the beginning. But all I'm saying is, OK? Hey, me? I'd give my life savings for one night with Marco. No, girl. It's not worth it. Imagine, Kara went out with that guy! I know, right? Who wouldn't lose his mind with your modus operandi? You make a guy fall for you, and then, when he's deeply in love, goodbye! You're very mean, girl. Guys, it's not my fault that they can't follow my rules. At least she learned something in New York. So tell me, why can't you get along with your dad? He felt like I'd become too liberated. Can I not achieve anything? I didn't study abroad for nothing. He just became awkward after that and... on the company. Me? My dad doesn't care about me. I was still in college when he abandoned us. We became so poor. doesn't believe in me. I'd set it up just like this. Well, the reason why I like that bed And I don't like that. The woman from the province is now stepping up. Of course. Dad is asking us to set aside some cupcakes for Mayor. He said he gave him a new project. He's only giving them to his mistress. Who has a mistress? Your dad has already said sorry. You're sweating. -Where did you come from? -It's just hot outside. -Babe, what's that? This one? -Nothing. -Just got it from the beach. Costa Luz. -May I see? Oh, those nasty, itchy jellyfish! -When they bite, they leave a mark. -That's true! Hi! Where's Ram? Oh he's not here, ma'am. -Jeff, just let me know, please? -Sir? -Are you going to see Ram today? -Yes. But I don't know why he's not here yet. OK. -Take care, bye. -Sister. Didith, have you followed up the... our dinner reservation with Mr. Ram Escaler tonight? I just got used to my old bed. It's really hard when you're used to something. Even for me, Because when you're tired... you've been through a lot. But Kara, it's... Love, I'm sorry. You weren't answering my calls so I decided to come here. Are you mad? Sorry. No. Ram. Aren't you going to introduce me to her? Cha, this is Kara Zalderiaga, my boss's daughter. Anyway, we need to go. So. Let's go. I have no intention of ruining their marriage. Chill, ladies. Now, yes, fun. But what if he leaves you? What if he chooses his wife over you? What if your family's caught in a scandal? Is it still fun? It's nothing, really. Well, I'm not used to talking to myself. I told you to stop crying! Don't waste your energy. Find out who you're up against. Remember, if a guy has a lot of other women, that's OK. That's not a problem. At least he still comes home to you. But if a guy sticks to one woman and makes her his favorite... that's when you should fight. But this is not my thing! Why do I have to fight for someone who's mine? Because the world is a huge Quiapo. There are a lot of thieves. You'll get robbed. So fight. Look at yourself. It's time to pack up that Lucy Torres image. You should bring out Gretchen Barretto! Like she said in Rivals. I'll take care of your red stilettos! But my rival is not just anybody. She's an heiress. Who's easier to beat, a penniless slut or a wealthy slut? They're both sluts! The wealthy one has an original Hermes bag. The poor slut has one from the flea market. That's it! Not in the mood? I'm in the mood but... Is there somebody else? No. Is it Kara? Kara? You're the only one I love. Babe, please put out the candles. It's getting hot. If Cha is starting to doubt you, then stop it. You might end up just like that YouTube video I saw. What video? It's one-of-a-kind! The wife attacked her husband's mistress in the mall. She was bleeding. It was like watching UFC. So, dude, you need to be careful. Wives are different now. They don't just sit in the corner and keep quiet. If they need to kill their husband's mistress, they'll do it. So now that it's confirmed that your husband has a mistress, why don't you ask him outright? I already did that. The prick denied it. Oh, yeah, men will never come clean. If I were you, I'd tell him you know everything. I'd make him choose the mistress or me. You're just afraid that he might choose the mistress. Wait, is there a Barney party that I didn't know about? Go. Leave now. Don't make a scene here. I don't want to be in tomorrow's tabloids. Too bad, I also like this. Are you getting this? Because if not, I'll buy it. I'm getting it, sorry. That's OK. Because I play fair. If it's already owned by someone else, you have no right to take it away. Of course. But you know, there are other options. Ma'am, don't worry. We have another stock inside. I hope that color is the only thing we have in common. But, I don't actually feel guilty. I bet it feels good to be an heiress. You can have anything. You can buy anything. As for me, I believe that Do you believe in love? You? Do you really believe that love can last a lifetime? Of course. Why not? Why don't you try it sometime? I've been calling my friend but she's not picking up. And also my way of thanking you for getting my husband. As a furniture supplier in your resort. I insist. Is there a problem? No. So it's settled. Let's go. Here... -please prepare the steak outside. -OK. It might be new, but it's already being infested. I think Ram would be happy to know you're here. I'm sure he'd even come home early. Looks like there's nothing that will keep him busy today. Oh, no. You might catch me poisoning your food. Just kidding. Did I scare you? I'm sorry. My humor's a bit off lately. I'll just check the steak. You should cook more. You know, But with that beauty, I'm sure you know a lot of shortcuts. I don't want to have a boyfriend yet. Oh, my God, you don't have one? No. I don't want to get stressed. I mean, look at me. I'm fresh, not haggard. You know, love, if Kara were to have a future husband... That's why it's such a joy when you're loved by someone, and you know that he's only yours. Like Ram. Right? That's why I married him. Because he's the one I want to be with forever. I might go crazy if I find out that he has another woman. I might kill the mistress. Both of them, actually. Why did you do it, Charmaine? How could you embarrass my boss's daughter like that? Embarrass? I thought nothing was going on between you and Kara? I'm just befriending her. What's wrong with that? Just befriending her? Stop trying to make a fool of me, Charmaine. You wanted to terrorize her. You wanted to tell her to her face that she's my mistress. If she's not, then she's not! What's your problem? Even though I keep telling you that there's nothing between us... Why are you acting that way? The Ram I know would never cheat. Because he doesn't want to be like my dad. Or worse, like your dad! straight out of a cheap soap opera! What if she'd stabbed you right there? Did you forget you're Kara Zalderiaga? That's what you wanted to hear, right? What would you do Would you just accept defeat? Well, I won't! You asshole! I've been telling you, that's trouble! If I were you, I'd break up with Kara. Wait, don't tell me, you're in love with her now? I'm telling you, dude... What about Cha? Of course I'm going to choose her. I love my wife. You know that. -I can't lose her. -That's it. Now, what are you gonna do with Kara? I'd like to apologize for how she treated you. I'm sorry I wasn't able to stop her. But tell her if she doesn't stop, I'll definitely fight back. I'm struggling now. I think she knows. I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to blow up at you like that. I overreacted, I'm sorry. Babe, talk to me, please. Ram, when you come home, and you see me, what do you see? What kind of a question is that? Do you still see the Charmaine you loved? The Charmaine you married? Or do you regret that you got married so early? Cha, I married you because I love you. When I was so down, and I couldn't even love myself, Cha, I'll never forget that. Forgive me. Are we OK now? Are we friends again? Cha. Let's go there. -How are you? -I'm OK, sir. Sorry I had to come. Ram insisted. Let's check in. He's intentionally hurting you! It's not worth your stress! Right? If you can't take the situation then get out of it. It's that simple, right? You should be an expert by now. Where's the Kara who dumps men so easily? What's happening to you? Kara? Only a bit of pressure, and it gives. I guess you really can't stand by your promises. Here you go, ma'am. To catch us on the act? I'm just guarding my husband. You know, a marriage is like an exclusive village. You have to guard it against squatters. Well, here in our resort, we don't allow people who act like squatters. I'm surprised they let you in. What do you call those people who have affairs with married men? Oh, yeah. Snakes. Is that your bikini or is that your skin? So that explains why you're such a good crawler. Yes, hasn't he told you yet? I can teach you if you want. So you'll stop being paranoid, Tonight, as you are snoring, he'll come knocking at my door. Hi, babe, how was the swimming? Charmaine, what's the problem? Charmaine, talk to me. What happened? -Charmaine. -Get off of me! Enough! I knew! But it still hurt when I heard it from her! It hurts, do you know that? It hurts! -Charmaine! -I've been lowering myself! I shouldn't be doing this! But I'm doing this because I love you! -I love you! Do you know that? -I'm sorry... Let go of me! You pigs! You know? I feel like you defiled me! -You defiled me! -Babe. Please. Enough, we'll fix this. Stop it, please. Let me go! This isn't me, but I'm doing this for you! This isn't me! Get off of me! I said get off of me! -You're a piece of work! -Are you here to confront me too? Are you trying to destroy my life? Are you a lunatic? Why did you tell her? What do you want to happen? Kara, you think I'm gonna choose you over my wife? -What right do you have to get mad? -What do you think of me? You have no right! Aren't you the one who said you didn't want to be a mistress? Ram, don't you leave! You just used me, right? You used me! You didn't love me! Did you even love me? Did I love you? Is that what you wanted to hear? If I told you I loved you, would you stop this? We're over, Kara! We're over! Please don't leave me. What do I have to do for you to love me? -No! Please! -Kara, enough. -Charmaine, stop it! -You're a nasty flirt! Enough! -Stop this! -Get off of me! Charmaine, stop it! Charmaine, stop it! You're a flirt! You're a nasty flirt! Enough... Let me go! -Charmaine, please. -Enough! Let me go! Enough... Leave it there. I'm going to Daddy. Ram, I give up. Cha... Ram, why? What else do you want? Is there something wrong with my cooking? Am I ugly? I don't know. I'm going mad thinking about it. Why? How could you do this to me? It hurts, Ram! It hurts! Let's go our separate ways. Cha, I know I've sinned against you. This is all my fault. You didn't do anything. You didn't do anything. Babe, please, don't do this to me. Don't give up, please. Sir, you have a 6 p.m. meeting -with Mr. and Mrs. Wong. Thank you. -Yes. Go ahead. I knew about your relationship with my daughter. The saying is true after all. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You hated your father so much that you became like him. Five years, man. No, this is all my fault. I lost everything. I know that in time, you'll fix this. And I believe you'll be able to patch things up with her. That's impossible. Ram, talk to me! On the count of three. -What's his blood pressure? -90 over 60. His wounds are deep. Call the lab and prepare the operating room. Yes, Doc. These are your husband's things. Does he have a history of stroke? Hypertension? Any allergies? You have to answer all our questions. OK, I'm sorry. Doc, I'm Mrs. Escaler. Is he gonna be OK? He's still under observation It was all my fault. that he could love me back. I didn't know that's how it is when you're in love. You lose your mind. that what I was doing was wrong. that he might choose me. That he might love me. He still comes home to you. He still chooses you. But please, forgive Ram. Please. Leave. We are both at fault here.
