(light guitar music) (birds chirping) (children laughing and playing) - Tag, you're it. - [Boy in Plaid] Come on Bear, don't give up. You gotta at least catch Billy. - Why me? - 'Cause you're the slowest. - Oh yeah? No bear can catch me. - [Young Girl] Got you! - Darn! (girl screams) - Got you. - Darn it! Everybody tired? - Yeah. Let's head home. - [Voiceover] Billy, dinner's done! - Hey Billy, your mom's calling. Dinner time. (girl typing) - There, that's it. - Makeup wonders? Are you serious? - Yeah, well, I don't know either. But mom says I should start learning about that stuff. She says I need to get pretty like her. - Yeah, your mom's pretty, but you're only a kid and the best baseball player we got. - Besides you of course. - Yeah, well, besides me. (girl sniffing) - Don't brag too much. - I won't. But you stick to baseball. (boy typing) There, now let's find the baseball scores. - Okay, I like that better anyway. (boy sniffing) - I think I smell dinner. - Race you! - Thanks, Mrs. Romanelli. - You are welcome, Sarah. So, did you kids have fun at the playground? - [Sarah] Lots of fun, Mrs. Romanelli. John just told me I'm the best baseball player we got. (boy clears throat) Oh, besides John, of course. - Of course. So how's your mom and dad? I haven't seen them around lately. - Good. You know, my mom's doing that beauty pageant thing for moms. - Oh. - So? That sounds dumb. - John, that's not polite. - Sorry, Bear. - You still calling her that? You're 10 years old now, that was cute when you were two or three. - Yeah, well, Mom, she's cute and snugly like a teddy bear. - Okay then. So, tell me more about that beauty pageant. - Yeah, she's really excited about it. Mom said, good looking women, they get favors in life, like good stuff. - Hm, oh, hm. - Baseball's what matters most. Get your glove. We've still got light out. - [Mrs. Romanelli] Okay, okay. Eat your dinner first and then maybe you can go out, all right? (car slows down) - Unbelievable! (car starts and stops) You've gotta be kidding me. Freakin piece of junk! (dark guitar music) Yeah, James Matriciano. My car just broke down. Park Delaware. Yeah. Please, quickly. I gotta meeting. Thank you, you do that. - Can I get some change? You got some change? - Yeah, how you like that? - [Voiceover] Oh! - [Voiceover] That, I just noticed that. (children chattering) - [Pastor] Everyone, settle down. Today's lesson is about the book of Acts. So please open your bibles to the book of Acts. (children scurry through pages) Okay now, today's story's about Peter and John after the appearance of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. On the way to the temple, they encountered a man who could not walk. Yes, Bonnie. - Well, what happened to him? - I'm not sure, but perhaps we'll find out. In biblical times, people who could not walk or had other handicaps, were considered to have some moral failures. It was thought that they were being punished by God for either their sins or the sins of their parents. But Jesus never believed that to be true and He passed on this attitude to His disciples. He also passed on God's power to heal. So when the man was at the temple and he asked for Peter and John, they were able to give him something much more precious than money. They gave him the gift to walk again. And I believe also, the gift of love and hope. Peter and John were able to do this through the gift of the Holy Spirit. - Wow, that's a miracle! From the power of God! - [Pastor] That's right, John. From the power of God. And Peter told the man, I don't have money but I give you what I have. - That's much better than money. - That's right, Bridgette. Does anyone here have a story about helping a person in need besides giving that person money? Yes, Sarah. - One day my mom took me to get pizza. And she gave me $20 to buy the pizza. So when we got to the pizza place, I went in. And I was waiting in line. So when I got to the front of the line, the man behind me told the guy behind the counter that he'd pay for my pizza. - Really? - Yeah. - I told my mom and she said that he was an angel in disguise. But dad said no, he wasn't. - That's right, Sarah, I believe that he was an angel, too. Sometimes angels come to us in disguise. Perhaps dressed as poor. This man was not poor but you never know. Angels of God can come to us at any time. Even in our dreams while we are asleep. Okay, now, I have another game. Well, it's more like an offer. (books thump) - Thank you. - [Pastor] You're welcome. - [Voiceover] Bridgette, it's cash. - [Voiceover] Thanks. - Okay, now, settle down. And remember what I told you. Now you have money and you have the power to buy and do anything with it. It's your choice. You can buy anything and do anything, you choose. Mike, go. - I'll probably get some video games. - Bonnie, go. - A sweater. - John, go. - Um, baseball bat. - [Pastor] Sarah, go. - Um, baseball, too. - Okay, well, we have a sweater, two baseball bats, some video games. There seems to be a pattern, right? Everyone wants something just for themselves. That's fine. That's fine for now. (books thump) - Yes? - I'm not picking on you. I just happened to stop here. - Okay, then. - You wanted a sweater, Bonnie, right? - Uh huh. - Do you see that man, there? - That one? - Yeah, the one sitting on the curb. - Yes. - He's homeless and I believe he's hungry. - Mm hm. Looks like it. - Do you still want that sweater? - Yeah. - Right, because it gets cold in winter, right? - Mm hm. And a girl needs style. (children lightly laughing) - Me now? - Yes, you John. - Do you see that man outside? Sitting on the curb? - Yeah, the same one as before. - Yeah, the same one. He's still hungry and he's still homeless. Are you sure you want that baseball bat? - Yeah, I wanna be a baseball player. - Well, the kid wants to be a baseball player, I think he does need a baseball bat, right? (children laugh and agree) Sarah, come with me. Do you see that man? The one sitting on the curb? Same as before. - Uh huh. - Now imagine, there's a big storm, snow storm. And sitting next to him there's an elderly woman. She has snow covering her face. She could be your grandmother, we don't know. She's cold and hungry. She's starting to fall. He face first. This could be it for her. All of you kids are at home. You're warm, you're eating, and you're laughing. And they're out there. Cold and hungry. Do you still want your baseball bat, Sarah? - No, I changed my mind. I want to go down there and give them my coat and lunch. And then use the money that you gave us to get them a cab so they can go to the hospital and get better. - That's exactly what I wanted to hear. Thank you, Sarah. Go back to your seat. One last thing, Michael, please read for me, Matthew 25:40. - [Michael] The King will reply, I tell you, whenever you did this for one of the least important of these brothers of mine, you did it for me. - Yes, that's right. We have an angel in this room. We do, we have an angel in this room. Remember, all of you, remember, whether rich or poor, we all have choices in life. So let's choose life. (children cheering and clapping) - I'm out. (throws playing cards down) - Call. - Not today, boys. - Yeah, I'll check. (dealing playing cards) - Check. - I'll go $600. - Fold. - [Blonde Man] Oh, you're the big winner tonight. How much are you up? - Eh, 20 large. - Got some good college money there. - Yeah, my boy Billy, I don't know about that. - I already got two in Princeton. Two good boys. But my youngest Michael, I don't know about him. - He's only 10. - I gotta go with Bob on that. If these boys don't have their heads square early, they never will. Wish I had a boy. Just my girl, Sarah. - [Blonde Man] I won't accept anything less than perfection from my boys. - Reminds me, the other day I saw this bum on the side of the road. - Which road, Jim? - My car broke down on Park, you know, across the river. Those bums hang out. I pay 80 large for a car in the last three weeks. I'm gonna take it outta that dealers hide. - Okay, you can get on with the story now. - Okay, John. So anyway, this bum comes up to me. He asked for cash! Got some nerve. - Yeah. - You know what I did? (laughs) I just flicked my ash on him and walked on by. (men laugh) - [Blonde Man] So, did you give him any coin? - Nah, I was just screwin' with him. (men laughing) (crickets chirring) - [Voiceover] John, Sarah, you two okay? - Yeah, Mom. We're good. - We're okay, Mrs. Romanelli. - [Voiceover] You need me? - No, Mom. We're good. - [Voiceover] Okay, we'll be back in a little while. - Which one of those stars you think is Heaven? - How do you know Heaven is a star? - It must be. - [John] Why? - Where else would it be? - I think Heaven's all around us. - I hope so. What do you wanna be? You know, when we grow up? - Baseball player. What else is there? - I wanna do something big, something good. - Baseball players do good. - What about love and marriage? - Nah, that stuff can wait. After baseball and I retire, maybe. Jeez, we're only 10, you know? You seem like your mom with all this adult talk. - Okay, I'll stop. - [Voiceover] Sarah, John, come on in. - Let's go. - Wait! Rember what Pastor Anne said? - Yeah, in class. - Well, I choose life. I want us all to be together in Heaven. To see the people I love there. - Don't worry, Bear, we'll always be together. Race you to the door! (children scampering) (teen boys playing catch) (teen girls talking and giggling) - (Wow, Billy needs to work on his catch) (teen girls giggle in agreement) - So girls, are we ready for the prom? - I have a few options. - Who are you going with, Bonnie? Maybe Al? - No, I'm still considering Joe. - That nerd from science class? - No! The nerd from math class. (teen girls giggle) Bridgette, I can't help myself. - Sarah, who are you going with? (sigh) - Still no date? - No, I'm not going. - We're all going so, so are you. - We just have to find you a date. Sarah, there's plenty of cute guys left. - Yeah, you're much too popular and too pretty to be left out. - Oh, yeah right. - What? - What? There's two weeks left and everyone's taken. Wow! Mrs. M, you look beautiful! - Thank you. - Hey! Which one of you jerks are gonna take me to the prom? - No thanks, that'd be like taking my sister. - We all have dates. I mean, we love you and all, but you know, like Billy said. (car starts up) - I love this girl. (kiss) Get her a date. - We will, John. - [Mrs. M] Bye, girls! Be good! - Hey! Why don't you other losers come hang out with us? - You guys are talkin' prom and girl stuff. Besides the game's starting in 10 minutes. - Them and their games. Hey, why don't we go see a movie, just us girls? - I'm in. - I'm just gonna go back inside. - Are you sure? - Yeah. You two have fun though. - Okay. - [Sarah] See you later. (smooth guitar music) (knocking at the door) - Come on in, Mom. - Hey, how'd you know it was me? - It's always you. - [Mother] I am your mom and I can tell when my little girl's feeling blue. What's goin' on? - Mom, how come all the other kids have changed? I mean like, all of them. - [Mother] Oh honey, is that what this is about? Oh, honey. They haven't changed. They're all still your friends. Just, some of the girls have passed you. You know, like I tell you about, that power over men. They way you dress, your makeup, your style, like me. - Mom, please. - Really, listen. Stop. If that's all you're worried about, don't. I'll take care of you. Everything's gonna be okay. - Mom am I pretty? Like you, I mean. (squeaking sound) - How's it going? - Good. - Big test, son? - Trying my best, Dad. - Well, your best hasn't been cutting it lately. Princeton has some pretty high standards. I'm serious, son. You have to get a perfect score on this exam! (slams hand on table) Are you listening? I give up. (wheel chair squeaking away) (melancholy piano music) (car approaching) (keys jingle) (car door closes) (insects buzzing) - Good to see you again, Mr. Henshaw. Is this okay for today? - Thanks again, Sarah. I couldn't make it without you. You're like an angel to me. You're my message of hope. - Thank you. I'm going up to the shelter if you wanna come along. You could have a place to sleep there. - No thanks. This is my home, here. I'm perfectly comfortable. - As usual but one of these days I'll convince you. See you later, Mr. Henshaw. - Sarah, I love you. - Thank you. See you soon. (light guitar music) (stirring broth) - [Man] Please. - [Sarah] Big appetite today, Mr. Vodkas - [Mr. Vodkas] I do today. - Thank you, Sarah. - [Sarah] Enjoy. - [Anne] It's good to see you here, Sarah. - Well I'm glad I could help. What is it? - I was wondering if you could do me a favor? - Sure. (door squeaks open) - [Sarah] Hello, Mr. McKewin. - Sarah, correct? - Yes, sir. Um, how can I help you? (man sighs) - It's pretty hard. I mean, I don't know what to say. (man cries) Thank you. Thank you. Pastor Anne says it may help to speak with you. Some of the other guys say good things about you, too. (sigh) Well, as you can see, I'm not in good shape anymore. I lost my job, my wife, all of my money in the market! Ponzi schemes, you know? - I understand. - I can't go on living like this anymore. (sigh) I guess, I don't know who or where to turn to anymore. I'm so sorry to bother you. You've got better things to do. - No, wait! Please, sit down. You came to Pastor Anne for a reason. And she must have some really strong faith in me to ask me to help you. - She does. - Well, I can't stand in your shoes and I know that you've gone through some really tough times, but there's always hope. You know, some of the other guys here, they've gotten through some really difficult times. But with a little faith I know you can get through it, too. It'll get better, it always does. Sometimes God works in ways you can't see or understand. I know you might feel cheated and did not expect life to turn out this way. - That's right! My wife, she just left! (sigh) She couldn't go on living without the money we were used to. - Do you have any children? - (sigh) No. No children. - Well, I think once you get back up on your feet, you'll find a new job and a new girl. Matter of fact, I know it. - Think so? - Know so. Just hang in there. Stay positive. - I've never been a man of much faith, but I guess now's a good time to start. - The best time. - No. I can't take this. That's not why I agreed to speak... - No, please take it. I understand but if I can eat well then so should you. - [Mr. McKewin] That's very generous of you. I greatly appreciate it. - I think you just need a push in the right direction and things will turn out better than they were. - (sigh) It'll be tough but I'll try to be hopeful. You've done enough! Wow, that's too much! - Really, I won't miss it. You know, I think if you just find a place to stay for a while, you can start taking interviews. - I don't know how to thank you. I'll pay you back once I get a job. (cars driving by) - Scare you? - Oh my gosh! - Thought I'd find you here. - Guess what? - What? - I think I did something good today. - Tell me about it. - Well, first I hope my dad doesn't kill me. (birds chirping) Dad? I gotta tell you something. Look at the last transaction there. (man sniffs) (man takes a deep breath) (man slams checkbook) - What in the world were you thinking? - I was just trying to help. - Help? He's a lousy bum! - James... - Barb, stay out of this. Honey, what, please explain this to me because I don't understand it. He's just gonna use the money for drugs and booze. He's a bum! He's homeless because he's a lousy stinking bum. - That's not true. Mr. McKewin just had a bad break. - Oh, it's Mr. McKewin. Since how long have you been on formal terms with these bums? - Mr. McKewin has dignity, too, dad. Just like you. The homeless and the poor, they have dignity just like you. - What are you teaching her? He is not just like me. He has no dignity. I support my family. I support you. - Why did you send me to Christian school if you're gonna treat people like that? Do you really need the money that badly? - Yes, I do because I work my but off for that money. - Where's your compassion, though? What? Woulda been better if I spent the money on cloths and makeup? - [James] Lousy bums! - Dad, you don't even know me! You don't even know what I do! Dad, you don't even talk to me, ever! (slams letter down) (quickly grabs and opens letter) (crumples letter) (slam) (sorrowful piano music) (students writing) - Hey, did you guys see what Jenna was wearing today? - She did look like a little you know what. - [Bonnie] Yeah, I know, I know. - She looked pretty hot to me. - Yeah, you're a guy, big shocker. - The tighter the better for you. - But I liked what Kim was wearing, that was hot. - Yeah, I like the way she did her hair today, too. - Yeah, she's really cute, I agree. - We've got the game tomorrow. - Right. - [Bridgette] Get a dress for prom yet? - No, well, yes. - Speaking of the game, has anybody seen Mike? - No, I didn't see him today. - No, don't think he was in class. (teen girls chattering) Watch this. (plastic crinkling) (chuckles) (thump) - Are you serious? - What? I didn't do anything. - I was looking right at you, you bum! That could of gotten on my shirt. - Why'd you have to call him that? - What? Sarah, we're just kidding. - Sorry, overreacting. - It's okay. - Guys, we have to have a big party to celebrate graduation this summer. - I'm not going if this jerk is there. - Okay, okay, sorry. - Yeah, good. You owe me now. - Yeah, sure. - As I was saying, before the kid nausea over there started in, we need to have a big party. We can have it at my place and invite half the school. - No, they'll be plenty of those. Let's just have one for us before we head off to college. Hey, Bonnie, you wanna be my date? - Nope. - Okay. - Can't wait for college. A lot of rich guys at Harvard. Just think, marriage, great house, four kids. Oh, and the boys will go to Harvard, too, of course. - Well of course. - They'll be presidents, CEO's, you know. - You're just gonna go to college to marry a rich guy? And then you already have your kids lives planned out? - Yeah. - Well, I want a career myself. (teen boys chuckle) What? I'm not just a pretty face, you know. Right, Sarah? We're gonna go to college for careers? - Yeah, sure. - [Bonnie] Well, I'm looking forward to summer break first. I am going to spend it on the beach. Maybe flirt with a lifeguard. - (giggling) I have a lot of new outfits to unveil, too. - Who cares? Nobody's gonna be looking at you anyway. - Anyway, let's talk more about our graduation party. - [Sarah] Party sounds good. - I don't know. (mellow guitar music) - [John] Hey, Bear, everything okay? - Sure. Why? - I don' know. You looked a little, I don't know, just off. - I'm fine. - You sure? The shelter? - No, really, I'm fine. - Okay. You know, maybe you're worrying about going to college? You know, we'll still talk. - Yeah, I guess I'm just nervous. Go play your game. - Game's tomorrow. (chuckles) Um, so, I should probably get going. - Yeah, see ya later. - See ya. - Hey. - Hey. - You ready to go shopping? - Well, uh, shopping's fun for you. Not really for me. - Come on. Really? Come on. I need to get some stuff for your dad. I'm not really seeing anything here that your dad's gonna like. You know he likes the good stuff. (soft rock music) Did you see that? Did you see that? Those two boys had it good for me. I still got it. - Mom, look at what you're wearing. - [Barbara] There's a purpose behind all of this, Sarah. Those two were losers, right? Right? Okay, so that gives me the power and with that power, I have acceptance and greater opportunity. - Greater opportunity for what? - For everything, silly. For you, now, it's boys. - Mom, I'm not interested in all that stuff. I mean, it could be great for you and all but, can't I just be me? It's just not me. You know, why can't I just be myself? - Because you'll never get anywhere in life like that, Sarah, never. No man, no power whatsoever. Come here. Like I was saying, if you want a man, the right kind of man, you need to look the part. Now, let's, oh, I'll take this one. Let's get you to the mall and get you some cloths and some makeup and maybe do something with your hair. Come on. Come on, it'll be fun! - No, not this time. - (sigh) Okay, are you sure? - I'm sure. - [Barbara] I'll see you later. - See ya. - Maybe I'll bring you something. Cheer you up a little bit. (suspenseful music) - Mr. Henshaw? Mr. Henshaw! (car starts up) (car driving off) (teens playing catch) - Oh, Mike! What happened to your arm? - Oh, it's nothing. Just forget it. - Is that why you missed the game? (fumbling with baseball) - Uh, I gotta tell you something. I'm actually not going to college. - What? - Yeah, it's my dad. Nothing's ever good enough. I can't take it anymore. Sometimes I wish I was born into your family. - I hear you, bud, but what about your mom and dad? (chuckles softly) - You know my dad. John, I'm not doing too well. My dad already disowned me. (car driving up) (intense grunge rock music) - [John] Hi, Bear. (car door slams) What's this? - Do you like it? - No. - Well I do. - What's goin' on? - I'm going to a college party. Maybe I'll get noticed there. - I think you should probably just stay with us. - No! Not this time. (car speeds away) - John, maybe we shouldn't have let her go. (crash) (heavy breathing) (door creeks open) - Doctor says you're gonna be okay. Look, I'm really glad that you're gonna be okay and that everything is okay, but I am not understanding any of this, Sarah. You have to talk to me. (sigh) - Where's dad? - He's coming. (knock at the door) - Is it all right if I come in? - Hey, come on in, John. It's good to see ya. - [John] It's good to see you, too. How's she doin'? - She won't talk to me. - Mom, I can see that. - Okay, I'll let you two alone. Maybe she'll talk to you. You are her best friend. I'll be back, honey. - Mom? - Yeah, honey? - Can you come back in with dad? - Sure. We'll be back soon. - Your mom's right. Your my best friend, Bear. I, um, I just don't get that last act. What was that all about? I'm glad you're doing okay and all and you're gonna be outta here pretty soon. - Look, I'm not your buddy anymore. - What? - There's no more playing around. I'm 18 and a woman now. - So, what does that mean? You're gonna forget about all your friends just 'cause your 18 and a so called woman? You're gonna act like a jerk and start playing bumper cars just because you're 18 and supposedly a woman? What about the rest of us? What about all your friends? Me, Mike, Billy, Bonnie, and Bridgette? What about us? I can tell you one thing, you're not gonna get rid of me that easy, Mrs. I'm-18-And-A-Woman. - I just feel all alone. - Why? Why? Why? - When we were 10 we all looked alike and we're not 10 anymore. We're going to college soon. - So? - So you either got it or you don't got it around here. And, you know, pretty looks, money, we're all divided. I don't know what I got. It's, nobody needs me anymore. - I need you, always. - I never wanted those stupid things. - What things? - For mom. Why can't anyone just love me for me? - I love you. - [Barbara] Sarah, John! It's Mike! He's gone! (somber piano music) - Well, (pulls up chair) it's been a difficult last few days for us all. This is tragic. It's tragic. For my daughter, too. I don't know what's gotten into her. I don't understand her sometimes, especially lately. I just, I don't get it. I just don't get it. - Barb, this boy is dead. There is a lot more going on here. Let's look at ourselves a little. - Ourselves? Why? - Because this is our fault, all of it. We corrupted two innocent kids. One is dead. One, sorry. - [Voiceover] Okay, let's just stay focused. You know, ladies, let's just keep our focus, okay? What is going on here? Okay? We've got great kids. - But why my daughter? Why Sarah? I mean, it's like something went off in her head the other night. Were any of the kids with her? - I agree with what Carol said. Some of this is definitely on us. We sometimes push too hard. - Really, Pam, just, I am rasing Sarah how I know. I am rasising her to live right and without me she'd be lost. - Are you kidding? Lost without you, Barb? She's lost with you. You're suffocating Sarah. You drove her to this. - Take it back right now! (women bickering) - Ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies! Okay, let's calm down. We need to have some comforting healing here, okay? We need to come together on this. We need to figure out what's going on and be there for our kids. - Can I say something? My boy died for nothing. He was pushed, both emotionally and physically. I only blame ourselves. Me and Bob. I wasn't there to hear his cries for help. He was a good kid. An innocent victim of his own upbringing! He couldn't possibly of lived up to Bob's standards. Please, don't let this happen to Sarah. Or anybody else. - I'm sorry, Mandy, I am not taking any blame for any of this. I'm just not. - Barb, do you really see or hear how you talk to that girl? She really just wants to try and help people and you keep pushing her to be a beauty queen. She doesn't want that. - It's true. Come on, Barb. Look at how you dress some of the time. Sarah sees that. All the kids see that. - I, seriously? I can't believe what I'm hearing today at this table. - Stop it, Barb! Sarah's a victim, too. All our kids are in one way or another. Let's change that today before it's too late again. - I don't appreciate that at all, Mandy. You know what? Maybe some of our kids are more victims than others. - Barb! - Barb! - Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. You're right. I'm sorry, Mandy. This just... - You may be right, Mandy. Our girls, too. They have so much and we keep pushing for more. Are they really privileged? Are we? - Can I say something? Look at this world that we live in, that we have here. All the wealth, the beauty, the stuff. The decadence on this block alone. We don't need all this! - So? - So? So? Is that all you can say? Listen, those of us who have, we really, really have. And those who don't, well we know who they are. We see them every single day. We look the other way, we ignore them. Those folks on the other side of town, they don't have it. Does that make them any less of a person or any less important than we are? I mean really! I am so sick of this stinkin' money! We all have too much and some of us want even more! And more for our kids. All the stress, all the pressure that this lifestyle is putting on them, it's killing them. We've already had two cries for help. Enough already! - But the way I dress, the way I act, it's all for a purpose. I mean, we women need to get ahead in life and this is what I know. This is what I was taught. - Barb, you are ahead. It's time to take a step back and walk with Sarah. You'll save her with real love and compassion. - Carol's right. This would be the time for helping and healing, 'cause we sure love you, Mandy. - Maybe you're right, maybe you're all right. But I'm really gonna have to do some soul searching here. Well, we've sent Sarah to stay with James's sister in Connecticut for the summer. She has cousins there and maybe the change of scenery will help her, but while I'm here, in the meantime, I'll do some work. I'll figure it out for my Sarah. - You will, Barb, for Sarah. You will. (door creeks open) (sigh) (drawer opens) (drawer closes) (sorrowful orchestra music) - [Voiceover] Sometimes angels come to us in disguise. (crickets chirring) - I choose life. I want us all to be together in Heaven. To see the people I love there. (gasping for air) - [Voiceover] Help me! - John, I'm not doin' too well. - Don't worry, Bear, we'll always be together. - (gasping for air) Help me! John! Please, help me! Help me! (gasping for air) Help me! - I got you, I got you, I got you. (coughing) It's okay, it's all right. (crying) - I just want to be with you in Heaven. I just want to be with you in Heaven. - Mike? - [Michael] Don't worry. We'll always be together. - Don't worry, Bear, we'll always be together. - [Voiceover] Angels of God could come to us at anytime. Even in our dreams while we are asleep. - Wow. No wonder. (crickets chirring) (birds chirping) - [Billy] Hey, you been here the whole time? What's up? School ended hours ago. - Yeah just writin', just thinkin'. - Mike? - Yeah. Mike and Sarah. - It's tough. - Yeah. (book thumps) All right. Let's get outta here, brother. (bugs buzzing) (light switches off) (light switches on) (flipping through magazines) - Did you see the new Woman's Weekly? Right now, go run to the store and get it. Page 58, you'll see. Yes! Right now. - Yeah, I just read it. Amazing! It seems like he's talking about Mike and Sarah, doesn't it? Of course. This guy, Joe whatever, did not write this. Sounds more like John Romanelli, if you ask me. Okay, meet you there in five. (knocks on door) - [Bridgette] Hey, John, get out here! - What do I owe this... - Read the article on page 58. Meet us at my house. - Yeah, I wrote that. - [Bridgette] Thought so. You can't fool me. I know you all too well. - [Bonnie] Then who's that Joe something or another? - I don't know. All I know is, I forgot it back at the library one day in May and I went back the next day to get it, it was gone. - You should sue him. - No, I'm actually glad it's out there. - But he stole your work! Who is this guy anyway? - You're more upset about this than I am. - Well, you should be upset, too. That piece could win you a Nobel Peace Prize or something. - Why do you think it was published, schmoloff? - Like I said, I'm just glad it's out there. - But you're not getting credit for it. - [Bonnie] I say we call the magazine and get in touch with this Joe, give me that. What is it? (scurries through magazine) Here he is, Joe Blanton, that's it. - [Bridgette] Absolutely. Let's get to the bottom of this. - What inspired you anyway? Hi, is this Mr. Blanton? I'm sorry, Mr. Joe Blanton? - [Voiceover] Joe. - Hello, sir. I read your story in Woman's Weekly. - [Voiceover] Oh, yes, the story. How did you find me? - The magazine. Now, with all respect, sir... - [Voiceover] You sound like a young lady. Are you in high school? - What? - [Voiceover] I think I know what you're going to say. What is your name? - Bonnie. - [Voiceover] Why don't you come by and I'll explain. - No! You come here. I am that mad right now. 15 Theodore Way. - [Voiceover] I did find your story in the library. This is a great story you wrote. - Why did you steal it? - Bridgette, come on. - I'm sorry to you all. Let me please explain. - Go ahead, sir. - I found your story in the library. You must of left it there by accident. The title caught my eye and I felt compelled to read it. You see, a long time ago, I had a daughter who died of a broken heart. Some say she committed suicide, but I say no, it was indeed a broken heart. And it sounded much like your friend, Michael. I see you're all deeply affected. My condolences. - We try not to talk about it much. - But my daughter, her name was Tracy. And she was just about as kindhearted as anyone. She fell in love once and her husband passed away from cancer. They were only 22 at the time. And my little girl, she never recovered. If only she had a message of hope. Someone to help her. She would be right now, about 50. I blame only myself for not helping her. If only I had helped her and answered more calls. So you see John, I read your story and I was deeply moved by it. You see, I'm an old man. I've been poor and worthless since Tracy and my wife passed on. I hit the bottle real hard, you know. I lost all hope. I only wanted to do something good before I die. Something good for someone. I wanted to spread a message of hope out into the world and somehow help others. I'm sorry, John. I should of put your story away and waited for you to come back for it. - I think we're cool. You did good. It's out there. That's what matters. Like you said, if you could even provide some hope for even one person, that's a good thing. - Mr. Blanton, why don't you read it to us. - You really want me to? - Yeah, we all do. (scurries through magazine) - Message of Hope, by John Romanelli. John, would you do me the honors? - The world is full of magical things all working together for good. But sometimes people are hurting, quietly suffer. Some voices are heard, some are saved, but others are ignored, lose hope, and wither away. Never really gone though. They're still here, somewhere out there. My dear friend withered away. His heart hurt and broke. My best friend heart hurts, too. I can hear her now, though. One is saved, one is lost for now. Is this a fair trade? A life for a life? As one sits in a mansion full, and one sits in a street empty? Is this the same trade off? A life for a life? If we listen closely we can hear them all. All the voices crying for help. Surely, we can't even let one get away, could we? I think it's time for us to band together for the good. There's a message of hope out there. She lives with us today and her voice shall be heard. I love you friend and I miss you. When we were 10 we all looked alike. No distinctions. We had no money and life was grand. Most of us are not 10 anymore. We need each other now. - [Bonnie] That was beautiful, John. (text message alert) (soothing instrumental music) - Pastor Anne. Thanks for meeting with me, Pastor. - Anything for you, Sarah. Is your dad around? - No, they all went to the beach. - Good, we can have a nice private talk. I think I know what's troubling you, Sarah. You're afraid that all the girls your are prettier than you. And somehow the world revolves around that. - Yeah, kind of. You know, my mom and dad, they just give it to me. My mom thinks that I can't get anywhere in life unless boys throw themselves at me and then my dad doesn't seem to care about anyone but himself. - Your mom is very kindhearted. She just has some crazy ideas about life. - Yeah, she does. - But she loves you very much and she wants the best for you in her own way. - Yeah, I know that. - And your dad, well your dad can be pretty crass at times. - Yeah. - But he wasn't always like that. I do know that he grew up without money and money has hardened him. He feels that, if he has to work for his living, everybody else should. He's worked so hard for his keeps that he considers everyone else lazy. Does this make sense? - Yeah. Kind of. - Let me tell you something else, Sarah. Michael's passing was hard on all of us. I know it was terrible. Look at me, Sarah. But here you are. And I know you as well as anyone can. And you're as kindhearted as can be. Don't lose focus on that, Sarah. Don't be afraid of growing up into adulthood. It's not that bad. You'll find someone who loves you for who you are. But in the meantime, just keep doing what you're doing. - Okay, I will. - And I'll tell you something else. Don't listen to the worldview of rich and poor. It's not that accurate. The ones who keep all the treasures for themselves on Earth, are the ones that are poor. But the ones who perhaps don't have as much money, but are rich in the eyes of God, are the ones that are truly rich at heart. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. - Why did you become a pastor? - Well, you could say that, I wanted to be part of a message of hope. Don't worry about Michael and Mr. Henshaw. They're safe. And one day you'll see them. And they'll remember what you did for them. So will God. Can I tell you one last piece of advice? (giggles) Sometimes the poor give most to the poor. (mellow instrumental music) - Hello. Would you like some cheese? - Thank you. (teens chattering) - There's a gas station up there. Why don't we get some drinks and head back? - Hey, guys, one sec, guys. - A little change? Spare a little change? - [Bonnie] Maybe we can get you some food? - Yeah, there's a burger joint up by the gas station. How's that sound, sir? (man moans in pain) - [Bonnie] No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, okay, okay. Do something, do something! - [Bridgette] Guys, gotta get him to the hospital! - Right on that side, Bil, come on. - [Bridgette] We'll tell 911 where you're heading. - Yes, please, hurry. - [Bridgette] We'll tell 911 where you're heading! (man moans in pain) - Our friends are carrying him along Cooper River. Cooper River, Cherry Hill, heading north towards the church Shelter. Yes, our cars are parked there. Okay, thank you. - I can't believe what happened to that man today. - Any word from John yet? - I just tried him again. - Still no answer? Well, what did the doctor say at the hospital? - He wasn't sure yet. That's why John stayed there. (sigh) (door opens) - That must be John now. Well? Oh no. Oh no. - Terrible thing to see. Man left behind like that. Nobody listening. Nobody caring. Nobody helping. Nobody took the time. - Reminds me of Michael. - Yeah, yeah, a little bit. - No, no, Mike, stop saying that. We all loved Mike, we all did. Besides, we cared today, we helped. - [John] Not enough. We didn't care. All of us here. That man is dead for no reason. - John, why are you so mad at us? - I'm mad at myself. Being so self centered. For not listening, for not caring. - But we did care today. We showed love. - Yeah, absolutely. God's compassion showed through. It was just too late. - If we just... - John, we just got there too late. It was not our fault. - Maybe we learned something today. - [Bridgette] Yeah. I mean, we have all this stinking money. Just a small amount of it could of gotten him a place to stay. - Maybe he gets cleaned up, gets a job. - Yeah. - I gotta say, my dad wouldn't of helped him. - Well yeah, but our dads were never out that way. - It doesn't matter. They all know they're there. - Yeah, I guess so. - What about the next guy? The guy that's gonna take his place? Maybe there's somebody out there right now, constantly hungry. What about him? - It's okay, Bridgette. - (crying) What about Mike? What about him? In a way, he just sat there and looked for help. I know my whole focus in life has changed. No more just finding a rich guy to marry and planning out my kids lives. There are more important things to think about. - Do you guys think Sarah knew that man today? I mean, think about how often she was at that shelter. I mean, she probably got pretty close to some of those guys and some of the homeless on the street. - What are you saying? - Maybe that's what got to Sarah. - Mr. Henshaw. - What, John? - Mr. Henshaw, I read he passed away. - [Bonnie] Who is Mr. Henshaw? - The homeless guy. Sarah used to talk about him all the time. I forgot about it. Just slipped my mind. He died right before Sarah had the accident. - That must of been it. - He used to call her his message of hope. After the accident, she said nobody needed her anymore. - You know what? It's not gonna happen again. I mean, guys, we lost Mike. And then we almost lost Sarah. And now this. We can't let it happen again. - That man who died, - Mr. Henshaw? - No, today or him Mr. Henshaw, either one. Do you think they were born poor their whole lives or was it just bad circumstances? - What's the difference? - Well, I can't see any of us being poor or homeless. Are we born into fortunate circumstances and they're doomed from the start? Are the victims of their parents? Victims of poverty? - Or are we? Are all of us here victims of our parents? - None of us are victims. Rich or poor, we all have choices. - Yeah, but Sarah had it right. There has got to be a way to help these people. We all certainly have the means. - I don't think the means is through money though. Money it's self never helped anyone. I think the means is through love. - You remember Pastor Anne? What you did for the least of my brothers, you did for me. - Or like John said, we all have choices. - And we choose life. - I think we can all agree that we've been through a lot together these last few months, but Sarah and Mike definitely opened our eyes. So I think that this choice should be for them. Sarah and Mike. - [Group] Sarah and Mike. (door opens) (sigh) - Hi, Anne? Hello. James Matriciano here. Anne it's good to see you. - [Anne] It's good to see you too. James here is Mr. Henshaw's granddaughters, Mary and Bernadette. - Hello. - [Mary] Nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you. - [James] Well, why don't we go to the kitchen? - [Anne] Okay. - Can I get you ladies some coffee? - Oh, no thank you. So it's nice to finally meet you, Mr. Matriciano. Your daughter, Sarah, was like an angel to our grandfather. He talked about her all the time. - That's very kind of you to say. May I ask why your grandfather was homeless? You say he spoke to you all the time about Sarah? - Yes, that's right. - Well, beg your pardon but, if you were in touch with him why didn't he live with you? - It wasn't our doing. We begged him to come home many times, but he just wouldn't. You see, our grandfather was injured in Vietnam and when he came home it was hard for him to find a job, and things were difficult with him and my grandmother. - Where is your grandmother? - She passed away many years ago. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Our grandfather was a good man. He actually raised us by himself. We we were poor but we got by. Then we got older and left the house. And then he hit rock bottom after he lost the house, after a failed job, after failed job. He didn't tell any of us where he was going. He was too proud for anyone to see him that way. We actually found him on the streets and I guess he got so used to the way of life that he grew accustomed to it and he said this was his home now. I think he's happy now and at peace. - James, I think Joseph would say that Sarah saved his life. She gave him hope when no one else would. - I'm sorry for your loss. I wish I could of done something to help. - It's okay. He is in a better place. - It sounds like your grandfather was a terrific guy. He deserved better. (children at play) - Oh no, that's okay. (ball rolls) Are those my shoes? - (giggles) They are. I don't have sneakers, you know. (giggles) How are you? - I'm okay. - Have you seen anybody yet? The gang? - No. Too embarrassed. - Oh, don't be embarrassed. They love you. I love you and I've been thinking about you a lot. It's the first that I've gotten to really talk to you since you've been home. And I wanted to tell you that I've thought an awful lot about you while you've been gone. And I think I understand. I do. And I love you very much. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. So you wanna play ball? - (giggles) That's okay. We can just go see a movie or something. - [Barbara] Really? Just you and me? - Yeah, let's go tonight. - Okay. All right, I would like that. I'll go in and look up movie times. - Okay. - Okay? All right, good. - [John] Nice day out, huh? - Yeah. - Don't believe I had he pleasure to reacquaint myself. I'm John. Nice to meet you. - Sarah. (giggles) - Look at those birds up there. - Pretty. - [John] Perfect harmony. Beautiful, isn't it? - Beautiful. I read your article. - What'd you think? - Was it really about me and Mike, too? - Of course. - I love you. - That goes double for me, too, Bear. You wanna go throw a ball around? Race you to first base like old times? - Not this time. I just wanna spend time with you for awhile. Do you really love me? - Absolutely, Bear. We've got all this life, all the next to show it.
