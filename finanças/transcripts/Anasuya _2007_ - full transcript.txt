You know what it is called if the same number.. ..is registered so many times? - You'll say l am wrong.. ..no matter whatever l say. You tell me what it is. lt's called numerology. Some people come to the betting place.. ..without knowing a thing about it. He's about to bowl. Look there. Now l will hit the jackpot. 'Oh, he has hit that.' 'Wow! What a wonderful catch !' 'What a wonderful catch !' Harbhajan Singh's birthday is on July 3rd, 1980. lt happens. - What happens! Ok, let's go. - You said three lakhs.. ..but it's just 1.25 lakhs here. - Note it down in the credit-book. ln whose credit-book? - ln whose credit-book? Do you know whom you are talking to? No, l don't. - Whom is he talking to? He's talking to you. - Then why does he say.. ..that he doesn't know it? Tell him that. Sir, you are talking to him. What's the matter? Are you kidding me? Anand, where are you, man? Over. Anand. Anand. Department(police)? - Task force. Pay up the balance and take your guns. Let them go. - Hey, you rob the policemen.. ..of their guns? God will punish you. Sir. - What happened? She returned at 9:30 pm last night from the gym. The murder took place between 9:30 pm to 10:30 pm. Who else was there at home at that time? A 60 year old maid. Her condition is also serious. ls anything missing at home? Cash or gold? Nothing's missing. But in that body the left eye is missing. What! That girl was killed and her left eye was plucked out. Where's the body? Oh ! Such a superb figure was wasted. - ldiot. Any clues? This is the only clue. We found this rose on the body. A few days ago in Madhura Nagar also the same thing.. - Yes. The same red rose. The same method. ln that murder as well a part of the body was missing. Stop there. Listen, sir. Listen. - Leave me once. Stop, sir. - Leave me. Leave me. - Stop. Leave me. Let me see her once. - Who's she? He's her husband, sir. - When did you see the victim.. .. for the last time? - Victim? Don't call her a victim. Her name is Tulasi. She's my wife. She's my wife. - Sorry. Please calm down. Calm down. - Calm down? Why should l calm down? - Sir. Sir. Sir. Please, sir. Sir. Please, sir. Hello. Mr. Anand, what happened, sir? What made you rush to this place? We heard that a murder took place here. Who's the person who died? - A lady. What was the motive behind the murder? - l don't know. Was she molested before she was killed? - l don't know. What? You don't know what molestation is? - l don't know. l never did that. Have you ever done that? Hello. Hello, sir! Mr. Anand! Who do you think the is murderer? - l don't know. What's the matter, sir, you are giving an 'l don't know'.. ..to everything! Are you really a police officer? - l don't know. Thank you very much. Bye-bye, see you. Sir, please, sir. - Mr. Anand. Please, sir. Ok? So that is the answer, a police officer gives us.. .. one who has the responsibility of people's security. ln this city, where the common man or woman doesn't have.. ..any security a woman called Tulasi has fallen prey today. Who knows whose turn it will be tomorrow! Road no. 12. Banjara Hills. - Get in, madam. Anasuya. - Uncle Joseph ! Yes. - Hi! l drank four cups of coffee while waiting for you. What's the matter? Was the train late? - Yes, uncle. lt was two hours late. - Ok, now come in. And how's your warden Rajeshwari? She's fine, uncle. - Good. Good. When is your interview? - 9 O' clock. You should leave now. That's the bedroom. Get ready fast. - Ok. Anasuya. Double major in journalism.. ..and criminal psychology. Surname column is left blank. Address: Bramhakumara Samajam, Vijayawada. Don't you even know how to fill up an application? l don't have a surname or a pet name. Bramhakumara Samajam is an orphanage. l am an orphan. l am sorry. - lt's ok. We can see the world through anyone's eyes.. ..but we can see the truth in this world.. ..only through a journalist's eyes. Close your eyes once. What? - Please close your eyes. - Ok. lt's been five minutes since you entered this room. Can you tell me what are the things or articles.. ..you observed in this room? Three telephones. Two black, one white. One Panasonic fax machine. On the table there are.. ..five magazines. Asia Pacific Broadcasting. Broadcasting and Cable. Electronics today. lndia today. And Readers' Digest. ln front of you there are NTV's files, five pencils.. ..two sharpened and three non-sharpened. One astray, pot-shaped. One Kinley water bottle.. ..and cigarettes, one silver-color lighter. And six beta tapes. - No, five. O, sorry, sorry. Five beta tapes. There are 20-25 Onida flat screen televisions. l saw the remote control. One Viewsonic computer monitor with a keyboard. Cell phone with very cute sleeping chair cell phone holder. And since all these things are on the left hand side.. ..of the table you are definitely a left-hander. Correct? One black coffee mug. ln that.. ..a nice coffee. Bru, if l am right. No. No. No. - No. No. No. You are right, it's Bru. No, not coffee. lnk smell. The pen in your pocket is leaking. lf you don't take it out immediately.. ..then your shirt will be ruined. Brilliant. You are a major in psychology as well. Can you tell me what l am thinking right now? Had l got married at the right age l would have had.. ..a daughter of her age. That's what you are thinking. How did you know that l am not married? The third button of your shirt is missing. Had you been married your wife wouldn't have .. ..let you go to office in a shirt without buttons. He's a bit cocky. - Excuse me, sir. lt's time for the bulletin. We need to feed it in teleprompter. l will read out the headlines for you. Shall l start them? Hey, who are you? You want me to hear the headlines.. ..from you? What l say becomes a headline. Do you know who l am? The great Chakravarty. l was born before Doordarshan was born. l am the no. 1 reporter in this state. Now just now, but since the days of black and white TV. You know that? - l don't know, sir. We have got a color TV at home. - Hey, who is he? Sir. Sir. What's the matter, sir? Who's he? Where's that Prasad? He didn't come to the office today. - Why? He has got loose motions. So he won't come to the office if he has got loose motions? Nonsense! Call undercover reporter Lata. l need to give her a brief. - She has also not come, sir. Why didn't she come? - Same problem. Loose motions. What's the matter? Everyone in the office.. ..has got loose motions? - Not everyone has that problem, sir. Only those who came to your house for the dinner party.. ..last night have got that problem. What's so funny about it? - Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Leave me. - Chakravarty, it seems that you have.. ..got some tension? Any problem? - Good morning, sir. There's no problem, sir. Our undercover reporter Lata.. ..bunked the office today. And we have been advertising.. ..on our TV since a week that we would be.. ..exposing a minister today. - Whom could we send today.. ..if our reporter ditches us at the last minute? Send this girl. - Who is this girl, sir? She is our new undercover reporter. Her name is Anasuya. - Hi. Anasuya, best of luck. - Thank you, sir. What was your name again? - Anasuya. - Anasuya? Your name is a bit old-fashioned.. ..but you look pretty modern. - Excuse me. lt's alright. By the way, do you know Nandita Roy in NDTV? l know her. - Chitra of Star News? - l know her. 24/7 Ranjita? - l know her. Good. Reena Jain of Times Now? - l know her. But do you know all of them? - Do l know them? All of them used to work under me once upon a time. Because they were close friends of mine.. ..at one point of time today they have reached the top. What do you understand from that? That everyone who befriends you has reached the top. Exactly. - Except you. Boss, l have been a friend of yours since so many years. Why am l still lying here? - Because you are a man. Kitty, this is Anasuya. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome to NTV. - Thank you. Kitty will brief you about the assignment, ok? All the best. Thanks. - This state's home minister's wife.. ..has brought a six year old girl from an orphanage.. ..and making her work like a slave in her home. We are about to expose it live. - Ok. The home minister would leave his house.. ..at exactly 10:30 am as per his daily schedule. At 10:45 am, you will enter their house.. ..as Swati magazine's reporter to interview his wife. The secret camera is fitted to the handbag. Madam, bag. Hey, mister! Don't you know that you shouldn't.. ..check a lady's handbag? Just joking. You can check it. You may go in. - After the break you would watch.. ..a program that you have been waiting for since a week. Watch an expose in a minister's house on NTV live. Fine. Fine. Now hang up the phone. Hello, madam! - Are you the girl from Swati magazine? Yes, madam. - Sit down. Sit down. l think you came here to ask me something. Ask me fast what it is. l heard that you prepare delicious chicken biryani. Would you give us the recipe? - What SP? Not SP, l am asking you for the recipe. What does it mean? - The method of its preparation. Oh God! So everyone in Andhra Pradesh.. ..came to know about my biryani? Look, girl. l am not praising my own biryani.. ..but when l prepare the biryani.. ..people chew their fingers along with the chicken-bones. When my husband goes to Delhi.. ..the first thing that PM asks him is about my biryani. Will you give me some water? - Just water? lt's such a hot day out there. You should drink lassi. Lakshmi. Hey, Lakshmi. Where are you? Get ready. There's sweet buttermilk in the fridge, isn't there? Pour it in a glass and bring it here. She doesn't understand if we say lassi? She is illiterate. And are you married? What does your husband do? What are you staring at? Go and give it to her. Go. You ugly girl, what's wrong with you ! At what time is the meeting? - At 11 O' clock, sir. And that NTV people were claming to expose.. ..some minister today, weren't they? - Yes, it's today, sir. Then what are you waiting for? Start the TV. You ugly girl, my biryani has spoilt you. Secretary. - Sir. She's my wife, isn't she? - Yes, l think so. l'll kill you. l'll kill you. l am going to.. Move aside. Hey. - Hello! - You foolish woman ! l am busy right now. Call me later on. She hung up the phone. - What are you staring at! l am going to.. l'll break your hands. l'll cut your legs. You broke such a nice glass of mine. Hello! - Foolish woman, you are live on TV.. ..beating that girl. - What are you saying! Oh God! You entered my life only to ruin it. Oh lord! There are cameras at home. What is wrong with you? - Ask Anasuya to come out. What are you doing? Who is there in front of you? Hey, you ! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Come on, Anasuya. Come on. Come on. Come on, Anasuya. Thank you. Thank you. - Well done, Anasuya. You did a great job. - Thank you, sir. To intensify the eradication of the child labor program.. ..the CM called for a meeting with the labor minister.. ..and cancelled his Delhi meeting. Wow! For our small action, this is the big reaction in our government. Keep it up. - Thank you, sir. Kitty. - Sir. - ln the evening bull etin take this footage.. What's the matter? Are you rejoicing that you have.. ..become a star on the first day itself? Don't forget that there's a superstar here. l have gone on many such assignments. You might not know this, but l was born.. ..before Doordarshan was born. - Wow! You were born before Doordarshan was born? - Of course. Thanks for telling me that, uncle. She called me uncle? - What else! Those who are born.. ..before Doordarshan are called uncles. She is not suitable for friendship. lf you are dying for a friend l am there for you, boss. No matter however hard you try l am not going to.. ..be friends with a man. She bit your hand and fled. What makes you think.. ..that she would come to coffee with you? You don't understand ladies' psychology. Yes from a lady means no, and no from a lady means yes. After coming out, she will see me and say sorry. And l will say it's alright and ask her.. ..to have a cup of coffee with me. First she will say no, but when l will pressurize her .. ..she will agree to come. That is ladies' psychology. My Goddess! This psychology is not something.. ..on the lines of your numerology, is it? - Buddy.. ..numerology might fail at times, but psychology.. ..has never failed till date, and it won't. - Who knows! Last time we lost our guns in the name of numerology. And this time we might lose our jobs.. ..in the name of psychology. And where do you bring up all these theories from? Hey, what's this? - Peel. - Throw it in a dustbin. Do you know whom you are talking to? Task force! l will peel your skin. How does it matter if you are from task force.. ..or you are from air force! Throw the peel in the dustbin. Get down in the car first of all. Why didn't you place a dustbin where l threw the peel? Hey, she's coming. Stop that meaningless discussion.. ..and throw that peel in the dustbin. - You better come out. Excuse me. - Hey, leave my hand. Relax. Relax. - Don't.. Relax. - lf you come close to me l'll hit you with this stone. You know, how big a crime it is to bite a police officer on duty? l can arrest you for that. - Why did you hold my hand.. ..in the first place? lf l had this stone in my hands then.. ..l would've broken your head. - Relax. lf you have a cup of coffee with me l'll forgive you. With the excuse of a cup of coffee.. ..you want to get me into your car and take me to the station? lf you try to get smart with me l will break your teeth. No. No. No. No. Don't be stupid. What! You'll hit him with a stone? What would you get by hitting him with such a small stone? Take this stone. You can break at least 3-4 teeth. Hit him. Stupid fellow. Hey, stop. lf you don't come with me.. ..l will arrest you, and take you to coffee, if it comes to that. Oh God! How could she hit you in that way and run away! Rascal! lf you put a stone in her hand and ask her.. ..to hit me what else do you expect her to do? Well, that says something. Numerology got us scolding. And psychology got us a bashing. To find that out do you have to get me hit by a stone? You're the one who said that when a woman says something.. ..it means someone else. So when she said, she would hit you l thought she won't. Yadamma. Where is uncle? - He is upstairs. Uncle. - Come in, dear. Come in. Rajeshwari has already called you thrice. What happened to the work you went out for? l got the job, uncle. l got the job. - Congratulations! Thank you so much, uncle. Uncle, can l ask you for a small favor? - Tell me, dear. ln a couple of days l will see another place.. ..and shift there. Till then if you don't mind can l stay here? Why some other place, dear? l'm the only one who stays in such a big house. lf you don't have a problem you can stay here. Your office will also be close to you. But one condition. You can stay here for as long as you want to.. ..but in your free time you must come upstairs and talk to me. Ok, done. - Good. Good. You must be tired. Go and take rest, dear. Ok, uncle. Bye. Commenting on the issue of hiring an orphan minor girl.. ..as the housemaid the home minister had this to say.. We hadn't adopted anyone. - Then who was the girl.. ..who was shown on TV? - A poor girl was begging.. ..at our gates and for the sake of humanity we received her. Receiving means torturing and treating her like a slave? What are you saying! lf a girl works at her home.. ..does it means she has become a slave? Won't we slap our kids once in a while? Can you call that torture? - What action would you take.. ..after this issue? - What action would l take? lt's you who have to take some action, girl. You TV guys. You dragged that innocent girl to the streets.. ..who was getting her four meals everyday in my house. Now take some action. You take some action. l will see what action you take. Start the car. This is a tale that everyone knows today. Who knows how many more such innocent children.. ..are facing such fates in anonymity! Were you given food on time? - Were you beaten up there? How did your parents die? - How did they take you there? Did they buy you? - Did they burn you? lt's the government that started.. ..the eradication of child labor program.. ..but it's up to us to implement it. Whether Lakshmi got justice or injustice in this matter. Whether Lakshmi who's been facing abuses and bashes.. ..and living a torturous life every single moment got justice.. ..after coming out of this hell.. Whether Lakshmi who is an orphan.. ..who didn't have the basic needs of food and shelter.. ..lost her only support and.. l'll kill you. Get lost from here. l haven't done anything, madam. They sent me out, madam. - lf they sent you out.. ..then beg on the streets for a living. lf you can't do that, then lie under a train and die. Don't send me out, madam. - Go. Get lost. Go back to the place where you came from. - Madam. lf you come here again l will break your legs. Get lost. Get lost. Go. - Madam. l am hungry, madam. Give me something to eat, madam. Please, madam. Give me something to eat, madam. You are bound to feel hungry. Why won't you? lf you stay like that for another four days.. ..you will learn how to beg. Go. - Madam. - Go inside. Everyone go inside. - l am feeling hungry, madam. Madam, give me something to eat. Madam. Madam. Open the door, madam. Madam. Please, madam. - l'm going to.. Madam. l am hungry, madam. Give me something to eat, madam. lf you dare to knock the door one more time.. ..l am going to break your hands and legs. Go. Go away. Go away. So you want a banana? Stop it. - l'm going to.. - Don't beat me, uncle. Uncle. ||{}UIETI||E What? Are you upset with me? Even l didn't know that such a thing would happen. l am sorry. From today onwards we are best friends. You will stay with me. No one will say anything to you here. You need not work here. No one will beat you here. You can do whatever you want to. From today onwards l will make sure.. ..that you won't face any hardship. l will always be there with you. - Promise? Promise. - Swear on me. - l swear on you. What shall l call you? - We are friends. l will call you by your name. You too call me by my name, ok? What's your name? - Anasuya. Come. Come. ||{}UIETI||E ''The sky is shining.''

Boss, there are many issues that reach us.. ..only after they postmortem them. Mr. Anand. - Sir, please. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Anand. Where's the body? - lt's there, sir. Take it out. Send the body for examination. - Ok, sir. Sir, how did the murder happen? - l don't know. Did you get any clues, sir? - l don't know. ls it the same murderer who is committing all these murders? l don't know. - What's this, sir! Don't you know.. ..any other answer other than 'l don't know'? l have always been like that. l stick to one word. l don't change it now and then. - Sir. Please, sir. Anand sir. - l don't know. Sorry. Anand sir. - l don't know. Sorry. Oh no! ls the footage for the midday news ready? No, sir. We are waiting for the Shaadnagar murder footage. You are waiting for the murder footage? But Kitty went there this morning itself. Did you bring Shaadnagar murder footage? - No, sir. They didn't let us take even a single shot. l tried to take some sound bytes. But the task force's Anand had one standard answer.. ..to every question. l don't know. l think the police is trying to hide something, sir. They are hiding something? Where is Anasuya? March 18th. A lady fell prey to a murder in Madhuranagar.. ..and her dead body was found in the water tank. The liver was missing from that body. April 4th. ln Jubilee Hills an industrialist's wife.. ..fell prey to a brutal murder. ln that body the left eye was missing. Yesterday morning a poultry-farm owner's wife.. ..was murdered. The left kidney was missing.. ..from that body. These are the series of murders.. ..that are taking place since a few days in the same pattern. The motive behind these murders isn't money. The women who were killed weren't abused.. ..before they were killed. Three things are apparent.. ..from these murders. All the victims are women. One body part is missing from each of these dead bodies. And a rose is found near the body after every murder. l need two special teams to investigate this case. Mr. Bhaskar. - Sir. - Find who all are trading body parts.. ..in the city. Find out who are buying the body parts. Who is donating them? Who is receiving them? Blood banks. Eye banks. Kidney banks. Hospitals. NGOs. Don't leave anyone. You must investigate everywhere. - Yes, sir. Team no. 2, Find out who is selling roses in both cities. Who is buying them? Who are they presenting them to? Bring their names and their family members' names.. ..along with their addresses, phone numbers.. ..l want exact information. Mr. Anand. - Sir. - You will lead team no. 2. Ok, sir. - What did l ask you to tell the media when they ask.. ..you something? - You asked me to say that we have no information, sir. From now onwards don't even respond to them. - Ok, sir. Did you see this! As you wrote it on the board.. ..here there is no one except you, me and the coffee. Brilliant. l love it. - Thank you. All these days l had this mental picture of police.. ..as those with big moustaches and big paunches. But it's just now that l came to know.. ..that there are romantic policemen as well. Romantic and handsome. Deadly combination. Both beauty and intelligence in a woman. Rare combination. Thank you. - Cut to Anasuya's camera. A few days ago, you didn't come with me.. ..even when l threatened to arrest you. But today you came here on your own by taking leave. l am a very silly person, am l not? What did you ask me ? Just to have a cup of coffee with you? And l gave you so much attitude for that. Other than giving you attitude l hit you with a stone. She is good. Very good. Why are you crying like a child? Do you have to cry for such a simple thing? Take this. - Thanks. Just because l said no once, why didn't you ask me again? Do you know ladies' psychology? No means yes and yes means no. Harsha! Bloody fool! l told you so. But you did a great thing by coming to me today. You wouldn't have had met me, if you had come tomorrow. Why? Are you that busy? - Yes. My boss handed over a new case to me. What's that case? ls it a murder case? Sorry. l can't talk about that. Professional secret. Oh ! l am always like that. l have no idea about what to ask and what not to ask. You are a very sensitive girl. You get hurt for every small issue. lt's not an international secret not to be revealed. A murder took place in Shaadnagar yesterday. That case was handed over to me. That's all. Hey, there's Anand on TV. Actually it looks like a serial killer is behind all these murders. Raise the volume. This killer had killed a lady in Madhuranagar.. ..Jubilee Hills, road no. 10, a few days ago. ls that so? - He seems to be a psycho. He kills people and places a red rose next to them.. ..and takes away a body part from each body. Look there. Learn something from her. lt's quite dangerous if such a psychopath killer.. ..roams around in the city freely. lf this news is announced people will be alert, won't they? You are right. We want to give journalists like you.. ..such information, but our boss asks us.. ..to give a standard 'l don't know' for every question. From today onwards he asked me not even to respond.. ..to the journalists. Stupid fellow. Who is he? - We have a boss as tall as a stout cucumber. That ugly face looks like a grasshopper hunter. He always screams at us. But he pees in his pants, when his wife calls. And also that stout fellow got that job.. ..only due to his wife's recommendation. His moustache is taller than him. Does he really need such big moustache? So after meeting me, has your opinion on policemen changed? Yes, it changed, especially about you. Anand, a policeman as good as a nice coffee. l like that. ''Women say something and mean something else.'' ''They mean something else.'' ''They mean something else.'' Sir. Sir. - Leave me. Leave me. You are not stout, sir. You are not stout. Anand, stop there. Please. Please. Please, sir. Hey, stop there. Stop there. Do you know who we are? Task force. Task force. You don't look like task force. You look like Bofors(fraudster). Get lost. - l will break you into pieces. Listen, l am sorry. - Sorry? You feel sorry? l said l am sorry. - l see. So you feel like crying? You acted really well. Ok, start crying. l'll see how you cry. l'll bash you up. - l said l am sorry. l just did my job. Nothing personal, ok? What! Nothing personal? You placed a camera on me. Nothing personal, ok? l have also got nothing personal. l will arrest you and put you into the cell. Come. Come on. Anand. Anand. Anand. - Leave me. Leave me. Listen to me. - l'll show her. l'll show her the power of police. Get into the car. Get into the car. We can see it tomorrow. Hello. - Before you go to bed.. ..take Lakshmi to the bathroom, dear. - Ok, uncle. Goodnight. - Goodnight. ||{}UIETI||E Hey, who are you? Watchman. Watchman. Watchman. Watchman. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. The case is becoming complicated. Till a few days ago we thought that he was targeting.. ..only women. But now he has killed a seventy year old fellow.. ..and slashed his heart. As per the description given by you.. ..we have rounded up some people. Tell me if it is one of them. He's not here. Pause the sound on those three shots. - Ok. Anasuya. l am really sorry about uncle Joseph. - lt's ok. Anasuya, l need to brief you about a new assignment. Ok. A high profile patient died in the National Hospital.. ..after his operation failed. And the patient's relatives and friends.. ..created a major scene outside the hospital. You've to go there undercover and find out the real story.. ..that took place there. Stop. Rewind. Stop. There. Play again. Stop. Right there. What happened, Anasuya? - lt's him. lt's him who killed uncle Joseph. His name is Govind. He's a ward-boy in the third floor of National Hospital. He might have some really dangerous weapons. Let's proceed with extreme caution. l want him. l want him at any cost. lf possible alive. And if necessary dead. So.. - What's the matter, Harsha? Harsha. - Sir. - What happened? Did you get him? We got him, sir, but there's a minor problem. l don't want to hear any problem. Bring him here immediately. The media is drilling us here. Sir! Come on. Sir. Sir. Sir. ls he that red rose serial killer? Did you get any evidence that it's him? What punishment will he get if his crime is proved? Did he reveal why he went on a killing spree? Mr. D.C.P.! Mr. D.C.P.! What makes you think.. ..that a physically handicapped person is the murderer? Will you really file a case against him.. ..and produce him in the court? The public is saying that the police department.. ..is behaving foolishly. You want to prove them right? What's this? What is this? - l told you right then, sir.. ..that there is a minor problem. - Minor problem? He can't even swat a mosquito.. ..and you think he is that red rose killer? The department has arrested a physically handicapped man.. ..and calls him the red rose killer? Your comment on it, sir? She might have gone mad, but what was wrong with you? Leave him immediately. - Put that aside, first of all we should arrest you.. ..for giving us the wrong information. Leave him now. Let him go. Let him go! What's this! Scoundrel. Stop. Stop. Stop. - No. - Have you gone mad? lt's not me who went mad. You have gone mad. He is a cold blooded murderer. You will leave him? You have gone mad. lt's you. Miss. Anasuya, it's said, that you're the one.. ..who identified that old man as a murderer, is it true? Aren't you ashamed of yourself on creating.. ..such fake news in spite of being a TV reporter? ls it a drama you are playing to increase.. ..the rating of your TV channel? Has the police department asked you to do this.. ..to shut down this case? Please believe me, sir. He's that red rose killer. Stop it, Anasuya. He can't even walk a couple of steps. And you call him the red rose serial killer? Where is your commonsense? One mistake of yours is sufficient.. ..to nullify all the good work you did here till now. Look how the other channels are spitting venom at us. lt's because of you. - With all due respect.. ..l saw him with my eyes. lt was him. Anasuya, confidence is good. Over-confidence is bad. We should create headlines in this field.. ..but we shouldn't become headlines. This is your first and final warning. Be careful. l told you not to jump in that way, but you didn't listen to me. You tried to fly like Air lndia plane. Look what happened now. Your wings got clipped down and you fell on the ground. lf you had been friends with me.. ..l wouldn't have let things reach this far. Govind, there's a party at the new nurse's house.. ..this evening. Will you come? Fine. l will drink your wine as well. Oh no! ||{}UIETI||E Come in fast. - What's the rush?

Did you hear that sound? - What sound? There's someone here. You stay here. l'll see there. Hey, Shreedhar! Shreedhar! Hey! Shreedhar. Shreedhar. Shreedhar. You may go now. Take her away. Let's go. Surround the place. No. No. No. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. No. Leave her. lf you wish l will come with you. ||{}UIETI||E Hello! - Anasuya. - Yes, Anand. Are you ok? - Yes. How is Lakshmi? - She's sleeping. ln the encounter that took place this afternoon.. ..Harsha and Jayanti were killed. l didn't tell you earlier as l thought you would be worried. Anyway, both of you will be safe at my place. Till l come there don't step out of the house. lf he had seen you there he would definitely try to.. ..target you. l am waiting in the mortuary right now. After l get their bodies released and hand them over.. ..to their families.. There's some paperwork as well. l will come there after finishing it. - Ok. Bye. - Bye. ||{}UIETI||E Hello. Hello. Hello. - You must be very tired. Why don't you take rest for a while? - Who's this? Hello. - What's this, Anasuya? Aren't you feeling sleepy? Who's this? Who is this? Hello. - Anand. - What's the matter, Anasuya? Someone is calling me on the landline repeatedly.. - And? ..and asking me to go to bed. - What! lt must be him. - lf he calls you the next time.. ..make him stay on line for at least 30 seconds. l'll tap your phone. Let's find out who he is. To be on the safe side there's a gun in the drawer in the hall. Keep it with you for safety. - Ok. Nothing to worry. Bye. ||{}UIETI||E lt's too late at night, Anasuya. Why don't you take some rest! Go and take rest. l know who you are. You may be trying to threaten me, assuming that l am alone. l won't be scared so easily. Don't call people and threaten them in this way. Come here, if you have the guts. Why would you come here! You are a coward. You won't come here. You know where l am? At a police officer's home. You are at a police officer's home? l am very scared of policemen. Anasuya, l tapped that call. We got the number. l sent the task force. They are near the house. Do not worry. You don't panic. Those calls are made from your mobile phone. - What! Where did you keep your mobile? ||{}UIETI||E Come on. Move. You stay here. l'll be back in a while. He minced himself by hiding inside the concrete mixer. lt's impossible to identify the body. The bullets found inside the body.. ..matched with Anand's gun. lf you confirm, that these clothes were worn by him.. ..then we can declare, that red rose Govind is dead. Yes. Madam. Madam. lt's you who killed red rose Govind? Tell us the truth, madam. Tell us the truth. Red rose Govind is dead. Madam. Madam. Hey, who are you? ||{}UIETI||E l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l'm sorry. l saw the red rose and thought that that Govind is back. lt's been one month since that red rose Govind died. Forget him. l brought this flower for you. Thank you. l'm so sorry. Hi, uncle! - Hey, Lakshmi! Look what l brought for you. Cut the ribbon. Fast. So cute. - Uncle, is it for you? - Yes. Thank you. - Ok. Now tell me what we should name it. ls it a boy or a girl? - lt's a girl. lf it's a girl she should be Barbie. - Wow! Nice name. Ok. Now go and play with Barbie. - Barbie. Barbie. - Do you have some ice? lt's outside. Out. Would you like to drink some coffee? - Yes. Hot and strong please. - Ok. Listen, l am sorry once again. - That's not enough. Say it again. - Shut up! You said, your mother is about to return from your village. Has she returned? - Yes, she has. She is causing the same trouble ever since she came. What's that trouble? - What else can it be! She is asking me to get married. Then why don't you get married? - Yes, l can.. ..but first of all things should work out between a girl and me. So you didn't get a girl of your choice yet? lt's not about my choice, but that girl should like me. Why don't you ask her straight? - l asked a girl.. ..to have a coffee with me so that l could pop her the question. Did she come with you? - She hit me with a stone and fled. That was then. - And what would she say now? What else will she say? She would say that Anand.. ..would make a nice husband, as good as a nice coffee. Cheers! What are you staring at? Are you worrying that Akshaya Tritiya festival is nearing.. ..but l haven't yet brought your hair and eye? Do not worry. l will get your hair and eye by Akshaya Tritiya. Today l will bring your eye at any cost. l will bring it. How long has it been since the operation? lt's been about six months, doctor. Do you take the drops regularly? - Yes, doctor. You sit in front of the computer for too long, don't you? Yes, doctor. - l will change the eye drops. Use them for a few days. - Ok, sir. Thank you. Now tell me what do you want? Movie or ice cream? l want both. - No, you'll get only one. l want both. - One sec. Will you drink this? ||{}UIETI||E She stabbed someone else assuming him to be.. ..red rose Govind? What's this! lsn't it stupid? Yes, sir. lt's very stupid. lt's her who shot him, didn't she? She has any psychological problems? As far as l know she doesn't have any such problems. Take her to the police station and file an FlR.. ..and produce her in the court tomorrow. Sir, the court is closed for three days. Then send her to the remand. Sir, if she is kept in the station cell with a kid for three days.. So you want to take her to your home? Yes, sir. l will produce her in the court on Monday. She is my responsibility. - Alright. As you say. But if anything goes wrong then l will have to.. ..produce you in the court. - Ok, sir. - Mind it. Hey! Come on. Come on. Come on. We'll go to home now. Come on. Hey, you know something? There is a surprise for you.. ..at home. Come on. Let's go fast. What's the matter, Lakshmi, you aren't talking to me? l bought some new toys for you and kept them at home. You know that? Both of you wait here. l will bring the car. Ok? Mother wants to meet you. Let's go home. Not to your home, but let's go my home. To your home? lf you would again see a milkman.. ..or a paperman and assume him to be.. ..that red rose Govind and stab him.. - lt's not a joke. l saw him there. He's still alive. What's wrong with you? How is it possible? A person takes birth once and dies only once. Ok, forget it. Come. Sorry. - Hey, don't you understand what l say! l risked my job and brought you out. lf anything happens to you they will suspend me.. ..and put me behind bars. Why did you bring me out? Did l ask you for it? Because.. Because l love you, damn it. There should be faith where there is love. Go to hell. Now go to bed. - Anasuya, will you go to the jail now? l won't go anywhere. l will be there with you. lf you go to the jail l will also come with you. Did you see that? Every channel's headline.. ..is about you. NTV reporter Anasuya who is about to be.. ..produced in the court on Monday. Gemini News! lf red rose Govind is alive then whom did Anasuya kill earlier? ETV2! Anasuya didn't stab red rose Govind.. ..but she stabbed an asthma patient. The patient's condition is critical. TV9! l told this earlier as well. We should create headlines.. ..but we shouldn't become headlines. - Sir, he's alive. Please believe me, sir. - Please. No more explanations. We appointed a new reporter in your place. She's joining on Monday. lf there is any balance work.. ..finish it off in two days and take your salary. Hello! ''Anasuya! Anasuya! What has she done?'' ''She didn't listen to us and tried to fly high.'' ''Now she dropped like a rotten fruit.'' ''She broke into pieces like a crisp pancake.'' l knew it that day itself, that you would face this day.. ..sooner or later. Had you befriended me that day itself.. ..your life wouldn't have become Titanic ship today! These are your last 48 hours as a journalist. Enjoy! Just one second is enough for the lightening to strike you. l have got 48 hours. Did you understand what she just said? - No. But l understood.. ..that something is about to strike you. To be on the safe side shall l order a good helmet? Kitty. - Anasuya, hi! Are you ok? l'm fine. l need your help. - Anything, Anasuya. Tell me what you want. -Where is Govind's case-file? lt's with me. Here it is. Five murders. Five organs missing. Why? Why? Why? What? You too think that l am a fool? No. No. No. No. That's not the thing. Tell me what we should do. - l have to find out this rascal. What his motive is? Why he committed these murders? What is he doing with those organs? l don't know what he does with them.. ..but l saw her husband a few days ago. He said that his wife's kidney was damaged.. ..so he got her a new one transplanted. And Govind killed her and took away that kidney. For that operation he lost his poultry farm. Now he lost his wife and also his farm. He's in a pretty bad shape. - What! Her kidney that he slashed belonged to someone else? Yes, madam. l got that kidney for free.. ..but the hospital charges were too high. Those hospital guys didn't operate my wife.. ..till l transferred my poultry farm on their name. They took your poultry farm for the operation? lt's shocking. Which hospital is that? lt's the National Hospital. - National Hospital? This is one of the scams that are going on in these hospitals? Scam? - What else do you call it? They transplant eyes in patients through operations. They charge an exorbitant price for those operations. And they get those patients killed and resell those organs. What else would you call it if not a scam? l don't know what you will do, but you will have to.. ..expose the National Hospital. - National Hospital? Yes. That's where they did my wife's eye transplantation. ln which hospital was your sister's operation done? ln National Hospital. - Was your daughter's.. ..kidney operation done in the National Hospital? Yes, madam. We should get our answers here. Four of the five victims whom Govind killed.. ..had their operations done in this particular hospital. Bloody co-incidence. He too used to work here. So? - We want the patient records.. ..of all those who were killed. - That's not possible. Now say what you want to say. l see. So you are the media guys. What do you think? l will get scared of the camera? Look, girl. Whom do you think this hospital belongs to? lt's central health minister's relative's hospital. Leave this place urgently, or l'll have to call the security. Hey! Hey, you ! There's a lot of information in this. What do you want? Patient records. Do you know their names? - Tulasi Ram Prakash. Bhimuri Prabhavati. Kalyani Naik. Joseph Curian. K. Lata. Who donated their organs to them? Why they donated? Where are they right now? What they are doing? l want to know everything, and everything about them. Very funny. The same person has donated.. ..those organs to them. - What! Yes. One person's organs were transplanted.. ..to the five persons you named. Same donor? Who's that donor? Sir, Mr. Rajaram and his daughter Pooja.. They used to live here, but they vacated the house. Where did they go? - l don't know, girl. Sir, Mr. Rajaram used to live in the nearby house. Do you know them? - Yes. Where do they live now? - l don't know. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Miss. Anusuya, you're here? l need some help. - l am Kalpana. Nice to meet you. Your neighbor Mr. Rajaram and his daughter Pooja.. What happened? Who's that girl? - She's Miss. Anasuya. l see. What does she want? She wants to know something about Pooja, mother. Look, we don't know anything that you want to know. You may go now. Come in. - Mother, what's this! Mother. Listen.. - Please leave. Hello. Outside the town, near the ebony tree garden. No one in this town will tell you about Mr. Rajaram and Pooja. Do you know Pooja? - She was my best friend. l miss her so much. - How did Pooja die? Pooja and l studied together from LKG to lntermediate(12th standard). Both of us got a seat in medicine in the same college. All the best. - Thank you. l wish both of us were in the same section. - Yes. Ok, let's meet in the lunch break. - Ok, bye. - Bye. On the first day in the college.. ..Pooja fell in anatomy professor Amar eyes. Before dissecting a body and conducting experiments on it.. ..what you need to learn is.. ..how to protect that body for further experimentations. ln the body.. Sir. - lt's yours. You dropped it in the classroom. Thank you, sir. - Do you like roses? Yes, sir. - When l see you l feel like we met.. ..somewhere before. l feel like there is a deep bond.. ..between us. Do you feel the same way about me? No, sir. l know you will come. Sir. - l know you will come. l know we will unite. A red rose salute to Pooja who gave life to my love. Pooja, l love you. The next day morning.. ''Which flower..'' ''..blossoms on which branch?'' ''Which bond unites them together?'' ''Who knows..'' 'Maro Charitra'. l watched it 30 times just to watch the climax. Have you seen that movie? - l saw it a number of times. For Kamala hasan? - No. For that song. l see. So you like this song that much? Did you like the roses? - Yes. Won't you thank me for that? - Thank you. Pooja. Why is there no rose in your hair? l have got a minor headache, sir. And then one day she told me that that professor.. ..is torturing her by sending flowers everyday.. ..and cried in front of me. You shut your mouth. Let's go and complain the dean. No. Leave it. lf you don't take any action, he will trouble you more. Kalpana, if my family gets to know about this matter.. ..they will ask me to quit my studies and return home. Leave it. 'And when she said that l too couldn't say anything.' l couldn't sleep all night. l have been thinking about us. l was wondering where we met, where we met, where we met. And it struck me exactly at quarter to one. Our relation is not of this birth, but it is of the previous birth.. ..and of the birth before that. lt's of many births. You don't believe it? l was born and brought up somewhere else.. ..and till now l didn't love anyone and l have been.. ..waiting for you till now. What else will you call it? And why would you too not love anyone else.. ..and wait for me? What! Do you love anyone? lt's not Kamalahasan, is it? Why are you so tensed? Hasn't your headache gone yet? lt has increased, sir. Something wrong. Wait, l will check it. Turn around. Breathe deeply. Deeply. Breathe deeply. What nonsense are you talking! Do you know whom you are talking about? Look, girl. Amar is one of the best professors in this college. There is not even a single remark.. ..in his career of so many years. So you think l am lying? - l'll come to that later. First of all stop wearing such dresses that expose.. ..your hands and legs and no one will trouble you. Madam.. - Look, this college has a reputation. Do not spread any such baseless rumors. You may go now. One day National Hospital doctors.. ..conducted an organ donation camp in our college. They told us how after our death our organs would.. ..give life to someone else. Pooja liked it a lot. She donated all the organs.. ..of her body. Thanks. Have you gone mad? Were you in your right mind when you did that? Your donated your eyes. You know what happens if you donate your eyes? You will be born as a blind person in the next birth. You donated your heart. How will you be born again if you don't even have a heart? What if l am born in the next birth and you aren't.. ..what would l do then? What would l do then? Kalidas said 'Bhavasthirani Jananta Sauhrudani.' Ours is a bond of many births. We can't be separated even if we want to. l have the rights on each and every part of your body. Keep that in mind. Go there and take back your name. l won't. - Take back your name. Take it back. l will kill you. Go there and take it back. Take it back. ||{}UIETI||E Don't panic. l won't do you anything till we get married. Ok? Today l went to Mother Ankala's temple. You know what Mother said? Foolish man, Akshaya Tritiya day comes only once a year. Marry Pooja on that particular day. You'd be born as husband and wife in all your births.. l bought everything for us. The nuptial thread for you, the silk clothes for myself.. l feel shy to say this, but l have booked.. ..our honeymoon tickets as well. Beat him. - Beat him. As Pooja was very disturbed after those incidents.. ..the dean asked Pooja to go home for a few days. Daddy. - Pooja? What's this sudden shock? How are you, dear? - l'm fine, uncle. Ok, Pooja. Bye. - Bye. What's the matter you came home without any prior intimation? They gave us study-holidays, mother. l wanted to see you. So l came home. Alright, fine. You take a bath and get ready. Prepare something for her. She must be very tired. Hello, Pooja! How could l live if l don't see you? Pooja, wait. Wait, Pooja. Listen to me. -Pooja. Listen to me. Pooja, listen to me. Wait, Pooja. What happened? What's the matter, dear? Today it's Akshaya Tritiya. What.. Who are you? What do you want? What are you doing? You don't know who l am, you fool. Who are you? What do you want? What are you doing? l am a professor. l am a professor in a medical college. l loved your daughter. l want to marry her. What do l lack? What do l lack? Can you get someone.. Can you get someone like me for your daughter? l don't want to marry you without your wish. Would you like to marry me? Today it's Akshaya Tritiya. A marriage is very auspicious. Even dying together is also auspicious. lf we die together we will take birth together.. ..in the next birth. We will be there for each other again. Pooja, l love you. Pray to lord that at least in the next birth.. ..he gives you a heart that likes me. At least then we can live together. Have you seen the irony! Our lives also had.. ..the same climax that our favorite movie 'Maro Charitra' had. We took Pooja to National Hospital in Hyderabad. Sir. Sir. Sir, stay there. You can't come in, sir. We will take care of her. Mr. Rajaram, l am very sorry. - How is my daughter, doctor? l am sorry. We tried our best. Because of the shock and trauma.. ..her brain has died. - What does that mean, doctor? Even if she is alive she is died. This is not something l should say you at this time.. ..but still l have to. - What's it, doctor? Your daughter wished to donate her organs.. ..after her demise. ln order to save her organs for the needy patients.. ..we need to transplant them in this condition itself. You don't have too much time. Take a decision fast. O dear! After the dressing is done you can take her body. l lost the money in gambling last night. Syder, where's the body? - Yes, where's the body? Narsingh, where's the body in the operation theatre? What happened to her body, Anasuya? Anasuya! What happened to her body? l think he must have stolen her body. - My God! So he kept that girl's body with her.. ..and is collecting all her organs that we donated? My God! What are all these? These are all the cards and gifts that he sent that girl. ''Which flower..'' ''..blossoms on which branch?'' ''l wonder..'' -l heard that song before. You heard it somewhere? lt's a song from the movie 'Maro Charitra'. lt's a super-hit song. - Where did l hear it? l want the song.. ..''E Tiga Puvvunu..'' from the movie 'Maro Charitra'. 'Whom do you want to dedicate it? - To Pooja.' 'Why do you want to dedicate this song to her?' 'l love Pooja and Pooja loves this song. - O lovely.' Uncle. - 'Your name.. Tell me your name. Hello!' 'lt seems that the line got disconnected.' 'So keep listening to Radio Mirchi 95.3 FM..' 'lt's very hot. Coming up..' - Uncle. ''Which flower..'' ''..blossoms on which branch?'' ''Which bond unites them together?'' - Uncle. ls that so? - You didn't get it? Yes. l heard that song on Radio Mirchi. - So? That day that caller asked to dedicate this song.. ..to a girl called Pooja. - But what's the connection.. ..between this song and Govind? - l don't know. Even the smartest of the killers make at least one mistake. And that mistake is sufficient to trace them. Anyways, you go to Radio Mirchi.. ..and ask them if you can get the information.. ..of the caller who asked for that song, ok? Bye. Where are you going? - Pooja's organs were donated.. ..to seven persons. Five of them are killed. l want to save at least the remaining two. So this passage should come as the headlines.. There's a big story behind it, boss. Do you think it's true? Why take a risk? Keep an eye on her. And the other eye? - l will take it out. ldiot. Do what l said. Which hospital was that? - National Hospital. Do you remember roughly which month it was? March. - ln that month we got only one donor's hair.. ..from National Hospital. ls that donor's name Pooja? - Yes. A. Pooja, d/o A. Rajaram. What have you done with Pooja's hair? We prepared a wig with that hair? - A wig? Yes, a wig. That's what our NGO does. We collect hair from different places.. ..and make wigs out of them and donate them.. ..to the cancer patients who lost their hair. Whom did you donate the wig that you made.. ..with Pooja's hair? ||{}UIETI||E ''What would you get at home?'' ''You'd get your wife whom you tied the nuptial thread.'' ''She will fry you like a pancake and chew you.'' ''She says yes when you say no.'' ''She won't come to you when you are in mood for that.'' ''She won't go when you'll ask her to leave.''

Are you sure these songs were played.. ..exactly on these dates? - Yes. Here's the log-sheet. Kitty. - Shall l give you some shocking news? Since last one year this song was played eight times. And five out of eight times it was played.. ..on the days the murders took place. - What! And also, this song was played just 10-15 minutes.. ..after each murder. Every time a call comes.. ..to dedicate this song to a girl called Pooja. When the caller's name was asked.. ..the caller didn't tell his name. Find out from which number those calls were made. ''There's the ocean of love in the heart..'' ''There's the ocean of love in the heart..'' ''l can't think about anything else..'' ''..other than my beloved one.'' Did you get that phone number? - No, l didn't get it. They have only last 20 incoming number.. ..stored in their system. - Just 20 numbers? lt's been a long time since they got a request for that song. Hello. - Anasuya. - Hello. Hello. Excuse me! Where's the dancer Chandini? She's in the green room. - Ok. Hey, what are you doing! - Shut up! l love Pooja and Pooja's love this song. So here comes 'E Tiga Puvvunu..'' ''Which flower..'' Yes, Anasuya. He's just called Radio Mirchi.. ..for that song. That song is still playing on the radio. Now find out what that incoming number is? Ok, quick. Now some advertisements. Cut it. Cut it. Hello. - Where are you? l am outside Radio Mirchi office.. ..with Mirchi Bhajji in my hand, boss. - You scoundrel! And what is she doing? Are you fooling her? What shall l say, boss? She made me stand outside.. ..and playing hide and seek with me. Oh no! Hi, Anand! - Hey, how did you confirm it.. ..that the body we got in the concrete mixer that day.. ..is red rose Govind's? - What! When did l confirm it? You're the one who brought Anasuya and showed her.. ..the shirt pieces found in the concrete mixer.. ..and confirmed that it was Govind's shirt.. ..and then confirmed, that the body was red rose Govind's. DNA. Did you file the DNA reports? Did you wait till we conducted DNA tests and verified them? With the excuse of pressure from higher officials.. ..you confirmed that the person who died there.. ..was red rose Govind and closed the case. Hey, what are you talking about! From the body you brought from that concrete mixer.. ..we got two DNA samples. - What! You said, that you got three bullets.. ..along with the body you brought here. The blood stuck to those bullets and the blood.. ..obtained from your house had the same DNA. Both belonged to the same person. But the DNA of the blood sample we got in that mixer.. ..was a different one. That means if those bullets.. ..were stuck to one person in your house.. ..then the body found in the concrete mixer was another's. O my God! What was the number again? - 98493.. - 98493. ..46889. - Sorry, madam. We can't give out such details. Please try to understand. lt's very important to know.. ..who got Pooja's right eye. Because of that eye that person's life is in danger. l am unable to understand what you are saying. You are asking information about a sensitive case. As there was a mistake in transplanting that eye.. ..the doctor on duty that day was also suspended for that. Suspended? Who is that doctor? l will give you the address. Wait a minute. Thank you. - Thank you. lt's Govind's address, isn't it? - l'll take care of it. Listen, call the task force and the D.C.P. - Ok, boss. Anasuya, now l will see you. Where's Dr. Mohan Das? - He's checking a patient inside. Please sit there. Hello! Madam. Madam. Dr. Mohan Das. Hello, Miss. Anasuya! How come you are here? You became very popular in a very short time. And how's Lakshmi? - Lakshmi? Which Lakshmi? Which Lakshmi? The girl whom you rescued.. ..from the home minister's house and adopted. lt's that girl. -Lakshmi? How do you know Lakshmi? How do l know her? An orphan girl who had an eye injury.. ..and whose eye was to be removed was brought to me. l felt very sympathetic towards that girl. The eye that was supposed to be transplanted to an old lady.. ..who wouldn't have survived for too long, so l transplanted.. ..that eye on Lakshmi who had a long life ahead.. ..but l was fired from my job for that. That eye is transplanted in Lakshmi? My God! Lakhsmi. Lakhsmi. Lakshmi. Lakhsmi. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Lakhsmi. Lakshmi. Yadamma. Yadamma. - Yes, madam. What happened?

What happened, madam? - Where's Lakshmi? She was playing somewhere here till now. -Where is she? Lakshmi. Barbie, stop. Barbie. Lakshmi. Sir. Sir, what Anasuya said was true. That red rose killer is alive. The body was got in the cement mixer is not his body. l know that. We came here to catch him. And to be on the safe side arrest that Anasuya.. ..and put her behind the bars. The person she stabbed in the hospital.. ..is in a critical condition. Anand. Anand. Anand. Anand. Anand. Anand. - Anasuya. They took away our Lakshmi. -Who? Who? lt's him. That Govind. - Relax. Relax. Nothing will happen to Lakshmi. The entire task force has gone to catch him. l will also go there. - No. Please let me go there. - l will bring my Lakshmi back. Relax. l will not let you go. Please. - Anasuya. Anasuya, .. ..listen to me. - Let me go there please. Anasuya, relax. Anasuya, l can't let you go. The person you stabbed in the hospital is in a critical condition. What!

Relax. Trust me, nothing will happen to Lakshmi. Please relax. - He will kill our Lakshmi. Relax. No. Lakshmi. - Anasuya. You have to keep him on line for at least 30 seconds. What's the number? - 9849346889. 9849346889. lt's ringing. - He would recognize my voice. You talk to him. Hello! - Hello! Sir, l'm calling from Radio Mirchi. On the second anniversary of Radio Mirchi.. ..we selected some of the regular callers like you.. ..and took a lucky dip. Congratulations! You are our grand lucky winner. lf you tell us your address we will give you.. ..the rest of the details in courier. You have won all expenses paid.. ..three days four nights trip to Singapore. And it's not for one, but it's for two persons. Hello! Will you give us your address? Hello! Hello! Sir, please talk. Hello! He disconnected the line. We got him. Not just in black and white.. ..but l will be the emperor of color TV as well. And me? - You will always be as stout as a portable TV. Call the office immediately and get the scrolling ready. What scrolling? - Show it twice every second.. ..that no. 1 reporter Chakravarty had investigated.. ..that Govind who everyone thought was dead is alive.. ..the news that created a sensation.. ..and eventually he caught him. Go. There. Red rose Govind can come out.. ..from that wall at any moment. Just because you have a remote control in your hand.. ..if you try to change the channel you will miss a lot. Stay tuned. The atmosphere is silent here for the time being. We can't hear the sound of the bullets yet. Let's see if red rose Govind surrenders himself. By the time we catch him watch some advertisements. Hey, where is Govind? - Why would he be here, lord? He would be in Tirupati. Sir. There is no one here, sir. Chakravarty gave us the wrong information. - What! Welcome back. Still the atmosphere is silent here. lf you look there you will see that along with the D.C.P.. ..the entire task force has come outside. Red rose Govind might be following them. Hey, Chakravarty! l won't leave you alive. - Sir. l am going to kill you. Stop. What happened? Govind must have given wrong address.. ..while buying the SlM card. That's why they must be.. ..thinking of killing you. - What! - Run. Run. Hey, l'm going to kill you. Boss, will you give me the phone once? You want a phone while people are chasing us? l will call the TV station urgently and change the story. What's the matter? Are you scared to see me in this way? My face wasn't so ugly earlier. l used to look very handsome. That's why Pooja also loved me. Do you know that? When Pooja died they plucked her eye, kidney, and heart.. ..and gave them to others. How would Pooja be born again.. ..if these body parts go missing! And what would that old fellow, who would die in a day or two.. ..do with Pooja's heart? That girl who dances in clubs needs Pooja's hair? l brought them back. l brought Pooja's organs back. Except this eye. l will pluck this eye and along with the rest of the body organs.. ..l will plant them back into Pooja's body.. ..and burn Pooja's body. And l will also die along with Pooja. l killed them. l killed everyone. But l won't harm you. Because Pooja and l both loved kids very much. See this. lf l give you this injection.. ..you won't feel any pain. l will pluck your eye and let you go. l won't harm you. And yes.. Can you see properly? Can you see properly with just one eye? That's enough. One eye is enough for you. ||{}UIETI||E ||{}UIETI||E Anasuya. Get up, Anasuya. Anasuya, get up. ||{}UIETI||E ||{}UIETI||E Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Anasuya. Anasuya. Anasuya. Anasuya. Come. Come. l told you, didn't l? l told you that l would.. ..just take your eye and then leave you, didn't l? Why do you run away from me? l told you that l won't kill you. Why do you run away from me? Hey! Anasuya. Pooja. Pooja. Uncle. - Anand. Uncle. Uncle. Anand. Welcome back. lt's an auspicious day for NTV. Miss. Anasuya who escaped from the tsunami.. ..created by the red rose Govind.. ..is appointed as the chief reporter of NTV. Miss. Anasuya, please go ahead. Thank you. The red rose Govind was a nightmare. He is an educated fool. He is a psycho. He read it in a book he got on the footpath.. ..that, if he dies together with the girl he loves.. ..on the day of Akshaya Tritiya.. ..then they would unite in the next birth. A superstition he believed in. l request the viewers, not to believe.. ..in such sort of superstitions. Not just that, but donating organs is a great deed. Donate your blood. Donate your organs. Give someone another life and get lord's blessings. Goodbye. ||{}UIETI||E
