C.S. Lewis is one of the most popular Christian apologists of the twentieth century. His writings present spiritual truths in easy to understand terms that appeal to a diverse cross-section of readers. But what can this famed writer, who captured the imagination of millions with his adventures to Narnia, teach us about life, love, and loss? C.S. Lewis imagined himself as a lifelong bachelor. As a professor at Oxford, he enjoyed the company of fellow scholars and writers. Lewis engaged in debate with the liveliest minds of his day and seemed quite content with his solitary life. Everything changed, however, after Lewis began a correspondence with an American writer named Joy Davidman Gresham. At first, Lewis arranged a civil union between himself and Joy so that this new friend and her sons could remain in England. But when Joy was diagnosed with bone cancer shortly after their marriage, the couple realized the depth of their love for each other. Thus began an intense three-year journey of exhilarating happiness and heart wrenching pain, ending with Joy's early death at age 45. " No one ever told me that grief felt so like fear," Lewis wrote of his experience. He came to terms with the loss of his wife in a series of journal entries that became the basis for his reflective book, A Grief Observed. In this work, readers encounter and identify with the emotions often felt after a significant loss as Lewis chronicles his grief in a sparse, moving prose. The book was first released under a pseudonym. Eventually, it was released in Lewis's name after his death. Well, there's a common misconception that Lewis had led a charmed life up until the time that Joy died and that this was the first time he'd really had to deal with these emotions of bereavement and loss. Actually, there's a kind of symmetry. He lost someone important to him in every decade of his life. He lost his mother when he was nine years old. He lost a number of his comrades during World War One. Of the five people he trained with at Oxford, the other four were all killed, and it's almost a touchstone of his spiritual condition how he responded to these different losses. By the time Joy passed away when Lewis was, had been married in 1957 and then she died in 1960, this was actually his fourth or fifth experience of bereavement, so he really was acquainted with grief before he wrote A Grief Observed. Joy died in July of 1960 and Lewis began keeping a journal about his feelings and all the turmoil and tumult that he was feeling. It was partly autobiographical and it was partly meant to be a universal experience of any grieving husband. A Grief Observed has provided many readers with inspiration and healing when grieving the loss of a loved one. However, Lewis' work is more than a reflection on the pain associated with death: it is a primer for sorting through the feelings that accompany any significant loss. My mother loved to laugh. She had a good sense of humor. I remember staying up nights with her watching Johnny Carson, and so much so that sometimes my dad would come out and say, "Why don't you two go to bed?" I remember her laughter and I miss that. My mother was a mother of ten, and so I think of her as the consummate mother to have had that many children and it's one of the things I miss about her was having her when I became a mother to talk to me about mothering. I got a call in the middle of the night December 17, 1985 from my 17-year-old sister telling me that my mother had been murdered. My mother had been babysitting two small children, actually a friend of my sister's, older sister's, and the father of the family owned a garage and had an employee he had fired. And this disgruntled employee showed up at the house where my mother was babysitting, high on drugs, and got in somehow. We don't know how, if my mother let him in, knowing that he was a friend of the family, supposedly an employee, or whether he forced his way in, but he got her to the second floor and he shot her and stabbed her to death and then he robbed the home. They found out who had done it pretty quickly and he was brought to trial, which was excruciating. We all attended and just sat nervously, waiting to hear what was going to happen to him. And he was sentenced to life in prison, and that is where he is today, and he has no option of parole. I think what I initially felt was horror. There was no other word for it. Lt was just unbelievable that this could really be happening. In discussing loss, we recognize that no two people grieve in the same way and that the level of grief experienced is usually in proportion to the magnitude of the loss. In situations such as Lewis's where a loss is anticipated, such as when facing a life-limiting illness or divorce, the grieving process begins prior to the actual loss itself. Jamie loved life. She was a very enthusiastic young lady. She enjoyed music, singing in the choir, and she loved her animals. She had three dogs and she just truly enjoyed being with them. Ln fall of 2008, our daughter Jamie was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. When we first knew of Jamie's diagnosis, the Internet was kind of a mixed blessing. You could go to the Internet and find out a great deal about stage four lung cancer and none of it was good. There was some hope during the process. Certainly after the initial round of chemotherapy there was some indication that there was an improvement, at least in stopping the spread of the cancer. But that was rapidly crushed when the MRis came back and showed that although the chemo had stopped the growth of the cancer in the soft tissues, it had accelerated even in the bony structures, and radiation could help the cancer in the bony structures and chemo in the soft tissues, but you couldn't do them both at the same time. So I think we realized that all we were doing, to an extent, was delaying the inevitable, if you will. We were able to go on a special trip to Scotland. This was sponsored by the Make-A-Wish Foundation and our whole family went. This was a wish that Jamie had. Eight of us went and this was one that we could cherish as a family together for many, many years and I think it has made our time of grief that much easier to cope with. She just enjoyed this trip. It was shortly after returning from that trip that she suddenly died with complications from her cancer. When I first realized that the loss was real, I think the most feeling was of sadness, of emptiness, of regret that a life had come to end before its time. I don't believe that the grieving has interfered with my memories of Jamie. I’ll always remember her as a vibrant young lady who brought much joy to my life and I was blessed to have her. Her last words helped in that because instead of thinking of herself, she was telling us to tell other people she loved them. She told us to be strong and she told us to keep our faith and that's much stronger than any loss of memory that I could have envisioned. Grief is an individual response to loss. Some will only experience a few of the feelings associated with grief, while others will work through a variety of emotions: denial, anger, bargaining, guilt, and at some point, acceptance. The first emotion often felt is denial, in which we put aside the reality of loss and exist in a state of disbelief. A person in denial may ask, "Why is this happening to me?" or feel numb to emotional or spiritual pain. This is a natural reaction that protects us from being overwhelmed by the full impact and devastation of a significant loss. I remember those first days just sort of moving through things like a robot. Really, just things that would be so overwhelming and disturbing like going to the police station with my husband to identify my mother's pocketbook and just feeling nothing. And going with my older brother to the funeral home to pick out a coffin and just feeling nothing. Lt was just numbness. For Lewis, part of his questioning and denial dealt with why God would allow a perfectly happy single person such as himself to find love and to come " out of his shell," only to have that love stripped away through death. I met Tracey in the late 80's and I can still remember the first time she came to church and she sang music. That got my attention. She had a great gospel voice, a big voice for her, and it wasn't long, about a year later, that we married. Lt was about six months before Christmas Eve of '94 that we found out we were expecting and it was a girl and we had a name, Gabriella. It was Christmas Eve, about one in the morning, that I was awakened. Tracey let out a like moan and I just shot up out of bed. I knew something was wrong and began to find out from her what was wrong and eventually with CPR because I knew she couldn't breathe. I knew she had asthma. I didn't know what was going on exactly. It was an asthmatic attack that she was having. They tried to save her. For two, three hours they worked on her, but they couldn't save her or the baby. Lt was just too late. That's when it all just gushed out. The tears, the feelings, the emotions, it was over. And the fear was tough. And the feelings were so intense at that time. Yeah, that was ten years ago, fifteen years ago now but I still feel it when I talk about it. In the early days of grief, we first encounter the reactions of others to our loss. We find there are those who avoid us as we grieve because they don't know what to say or do. Others attempt to bring us comfort, but their misplaced words add pain to the grieving process. " Kind people have said to me, 'She is with God, '" Lewis wrote after his wife's death. " Ln one sense that is most certain... You tell me, 'she goes on.' But my heart and body are crying out, come back, come back... Don't come talking to me about the consolations of religion or I shall suspect that you don't understand." You have to watch what Lewis was talking about, the consolations of religion, where you just use pat answers, the cure-alls I would call it. I was working in a university counseling center, and when I shared with my colleagues that my mother had been murdered, one of them said to me, "Think how great a therapist you will be having gone through this." And I was dumbfounded. I didn't say anything to her. I just remember sitting there and thinking to myself, " I’d much rather be a worse therapist and have my mother back." I think the best way and the best consolation is simply to be there and to help them with those little things that they have to do while they're grieving. You can't give consolation. You can't give that hope. You can't tell it to a person. They have to discover it. They have to discover those consolations themselves and experience that hope personally. Through the fog of grief we may realize that many people are uncomfortable around a grieving person, as it reminds them that loss can touch their lives, too. Lewis acknowledged this difficulty when he mused that the bereaved should be set apart, just as lepers are, to heal within a more secluded community. I certainly tried not to withdraw from the world, but there was a little of that involved in it. I was blessed to have very supportive friends and family that helped me, but there were always those awkward moments, especially when other people would come up and not know what to say, so to that extent, I think there was some withdrawal. I met the lead singer? songwriter of Brainiac, Tim Taylor, at a nightclub with bass player Juan Monasterio and it was arranged for me to try out as the drummer for the band, and within a year, we'd already put out a 7" single and started touring extensively. We would later tour the continental United States several times and Europe a couple times. We put out three full length albums and two EPs, a couple little oddball singles here and there. Tim was an amazing person. He was larger than life, both on stage and off. We became very close, more or less lived together in a van or at practice for five solid years, and it was actually on May 23, 1997 that Tim's roommate and friend, Dave Doughman, called me over to the house to tell me that Tim had been killed in a car accident. I got in my car, more or less emotionless, blank, and started driving home. When I happened to pass the scene of the accident, and saw the telephone pole that he struck, so I pulled into the gas station right there and I got on the pay phone. I called my dad, first thing, and just started screaming. Just crying, screaming, full of despair, full of panic, disbelief, didn't know what to do. After the initial shock of learning that Tim was dead had really, really set in, it then all of a sudden dawned on me that five years of hard work and travel and tour and Brainiac getting to the place it was at the time was all of a sudden over. And we were actually just a few days away from signing a million dollar record contract with a major label. I just thought that if I want to bed every night, I’d wake up the next day and kind of get a redo. He'd be back again, and in fact, it was weeks and weeks after he died that I had the same recurring nightmare. I would walk into this bar, very identifiable although not recognizable as an actual place that I’d ever been before and he was sitting at a table. And I’d walk over to him and throw my arms around him and embrace and the second I’d close around his back, he would just fall limp, dead in my arms. And this just repeated itself, every night, over and over and over again. For those attempting to help the grieving, a loving and attending presence is often the best comfort. When we first face loss, we are not ready to hear about others' grief experiences or to be told to move on with our lives. Instead, we often need the listening ear of a compassionate friend who will give us permission to openly and honestly express the pain we feel. I think every grieving person has to come to grips with their own grief in their own way. Any statement from anybody else that implies how they should feel or what they should be feeling is not likely to be helpful. It bothers me how unloving and really arrogant it can be when Christians try to just easily explain away someone's grief or give some sort of a Godly cliché or some kind word that should just magically make them feel better, when really what needs to happen is for them to join in with the person in their grief and just throw their arms in the air and say, " I don't know. I don't know why. I don't understand. I just know that you need me right now to be with you in this place." For many of us, denial is replaced by anger as we search for someone to blame for our loss. We question the fairness of life in allowing ourselves, or someone we love, to suffer. Anger is a natural response to the feelings of abandonment and powerlessness that may accompany a significant loss. I don't think I wrestled with some of the temptations that others have in the face of loss, and that is to see God as the cause of their suffering. It was clear to me that a human being was the cause of my mother's death and I didn't, I wasn't tempted to blaspheme God by blaming Him for evil. Instead, my question was, "Why didn't You stop it? Why did You allow it?" And so it wasn't, "Why did you cause hurt?" it was "Were You powerless to intervene or did you not care?" Through it all, Jamie was exhibiting such strength and such endurance herself that it was very difficult for us to get too upset about it. Her brother actually said that he had wanted to be bitter and angry about it, but he couldn't because she wouldn't let him. Throughout it all, it was just a real joy to us to watch her, not because of the disease, but because of how she was responding to it. Lewis acknowledged, even in his anger and brokenness, that human beings are not promised a life free from suffering. But while we may acknowledge every life meets loss, it is difficult to have grief move from an abstract concept to a harsh reality. Lewis said that a person never truly knows the extent of his or her belief until the matter becomes an issue of life and death. The reality of death strips away all defenses. My mother's murder forced me to confront what I really believed and what was really true. And one of the things that was true was that evil existed, and not just that it existed, but that I couldn't control it. And that forced me to ask a question of God: where was He? Why didn't he intervene? Lt forced me to reckon with the fact that God allows evil to happen. Lewis said you never really know how much you believe something until it's tested, and I realize for me, that test with her death and the time of feeling it, I got to the point where I realized I really wasn't blaming God for it. And that was just such a wonderful feeling that I was tested and yet in the long run I said, " No, God. I still believe in you. I know that You're good and this is going to work out." Our beliefs are always challenged when they encounter the world and matters of life and death are most extreme examples of that. I believe, as Lewis seemed to, that these matters ultimately challenge our beliefs to their very core. You no longer are able to hide behind your illusions. You're no longer able to rationalize. You have to deal with the issues that are there, and dealing with them will either drive you to despair, or it will drive you to dependence on God. At one point in Grief Observed, he says that you don't really test your faith until you're in a situation where you really see what the stakes are. And if you have a piece of rope that you're using to wrap a box, you're not too worried about how strong it is. But if you're hanging over a cliff from that rope, you're very concerned about how strong it is. That same image of how strong is the rope when you actually need it to support you, Lewis follows very quickly talking about Jesus in Gethsemane. And in both Grief Observed and his letters, he said he's so glad God didn't come to earth as Superman, as a man with nerves of steel, that you can see Christ's vulnerability before the tomb of Lazarus, and you can especially see it in Gethsemane. And he says he would feel much more rage toward God if he knew that God hadn't suffered everything that we have suffered. 1992 was a pretty remarkable year. I graduated from seminary and had been ordained a United Methodist minister and had gone out to Denver where I was going to do graduate studies. And, during seminary, I hadn't kept up with my training, but I was committed to getting back in shape, to get back to where I could run triathlons again. So, it was a beautiful November evening. I went out for a quick ride after classes, and as I got out to the turn around, I noticed it was getting dark and I told myself, " Be careful. Slow down. Take it easy." And within a couple hundred yards of there, I had hit another cyclist and then I came to on the bike path and realized that something was very wrong. I could feel my legs, but my legs couldn't feel my hands when I touched them. So, as I’m laying there, I have no idea what was in my future. I had really... well, I had been a chaplain at a children's hospital for three years. I had some sense of what was happening with me but I didn't know the full extent of it, and I had this notion that I would go and they would put me in a wheelchair and I would go home fairly soon. I had no idea of all of the ramifications that paralysis meant in terms of all the different body systems and how my life would be affected on many, many levels. So, after the accident, I was in University Hospital for acute care where they had to put two rods in my back and stabilize my condition. I had to recover from the surgery. And then after a month's time, they transferred me over to one of the best rehab hospitals in the country that's in Denver at Craig Hospital, and there I was in for another three months, where I learned how I was going to cope with life, and learn how to use a wheelchair, how to manage my bladder, my bowels and my skin care, and learn how to move and balance myself. And so it was a remarkable period of time to completely relearn how to function again. For people of faith, doubt mixes with anger. Lewis recalled those times of hope when Joy went into remission, only to relapse into a state of torment and frustration later as the cancer returned. He described the sense of being forsaken and unloved by God at a time when His comfort and presence was most needed. " Meanwhile, where is God," he asked. "When you are happy, so happy that you have no sense of needing Him... you will be - or so it feels - welcomed with open arms. But go to Him when your need is desperate, when all other help is vain, and what do you find? A door slammed in your face, and a sound of bolting and double bolting on the inside. After that, silence." I was walking with a friend and discussing this very issue of God's silence. I really felt like I wasn't hearing God answer my prayers. He had often answered my prayers, my other prayers in my life at other times, and now when I wanted Him to answer this one, it seemed like He wasn't answering. He wasn't there. No one home. In some ways I think I was prepared for this moment in that I had experienced loss in my life previously. My father died when I was sixteen and I had worked as a chaplain at a children's hospital for three years, and so I had wrestled with some hard questions about God, but still I could really resonate with what Lewis said about the door being bolted shut and having access to God. The way I thought about it was that God was indifferent in some moments, it felt like, and also I think more than anything was a sense of being disconnected from God. It is common as we grieve to search for answers for why suffering happens. The most famous example of this search for truth is that undertaken by the Biblical prophet Job, who experienced multiple losses including the death of his children, the destruction of his possessions, and his own poor health. As he mourns, he seeks answers to the question of, "Why me?" Job discusses his grief with three friends, who each conclude that God punishes sin and that Job must have done something to deserve his fate. Finally, God appears, and in His discourse with Job, reveals that a human's limited understanding does not allow him to see the reasons for suffering. It's inevitable when you read Grief Observed to think of the book of Job and someone who's crying out in his misery to God for relief. He doesn't mention Job in A Grief Observed. He does in his letters. Actually, he and Joy were talking just a few nights before her death and he was trying to take a rather stoical Christian spiritual approach to her impending demise and she kind of... she did this with him frequently. She challenged him and said, "You're angry. Go ahead and let that rage come out." She's the one who brought up the book of Job and she said, " Remember, people talk about the patience of Job, but what we notice in the book is the impatience of Job. But remember that God was more pleased with the impatience of Job, who is asking honest questions, than with Job's comforters, who were offering rather glib rationalizations." So Joy actually gave Lewis permission to be angry with God about this situation, and he felt that if she thought it was all right to rage a little bit against God and express your anger, that God would certainly accept that and understand that. Lewis described a similar encounter in his search for answers, stating that he felt as though God waved his questions away, not in a refusal to answer, but in a way that indicated the answer could not be understood. It is perhaps, what the Apostle Paul referred to when he wrote, " For now we see through a glass, darkly..." I think loss raises for us questions that our bigger than we are, and we are meaning makers, and we try and figure it out... I can remember after her death I began to really research the subject of heaven. People gave me books, of course, to read and read them all and spent, probably, a good two to three years really studying the subject until finally one day I realized I am not going to figure all this out. And it was good because I really believe there's a mystery there because there's some surprises in store. In our grief, we may begin to make promises or attempts to bargain with others or God to change our situation. Part of successful navigation through this season of grief is the eventual recognition that loss is inevitable and that no amount of pleading or bargaining will change the situation. I really didn't make bargains with God, but the thought came into my head as I was dealing with Jamie's illness that I would gladly have taken her place, rather than her suffer these things. Guilt is another emotion many of us feel as we work through the grieving process. We regret things we have done or things we have failed to do and we may feel that our actions have caused the loss itself. Sometimes we feel guilt at not being able to remember the way things were before the loss: at not being able to easily recall the face or the voice of a loved one who died, or not being able to remember the happy memories that existed before a separation or divorce or the loss of a physical ability. For Lewis, guilt accompanied the difficulty in recalling the past as the snowflakes of his own being, as he called them, settled down on top of the images of Joy, changing his memories of her. Lewis had said that he didn't want people to talk about his wife, but I felt that when people shared their thoughts about Jamie, that it helped me in my grieving process and I felt it honored her life. I remembered for several years very specific memories of Tracey and I could go through A to Z in my mind but after time they all kind of fell away and it's now pretty much one really good memory of her that has stayed with me. Sometimes we experience guilt for feeling better with the passage of time. As Lewis continued on his path of self-recovery, he began to experience guilt in allowing himself to heal and return to his normal life. He felt that there was "a sense of shame" in recovery and that he was obligated to both continue and relish his grief. One of the first times I felt like I was coming out of grief was with a group of friends and we were just talking and I was really enjoying myself for the first time and all of a sudden, it was just like, " Oh, I wasn't thinking of Jamie." And it just, you know, for a moment I realized I had this happiness, but then immediately, almost immediately, I felt guilt because it was like, well, it was too soon. I shouldn't be feeling this, but yet this was exactly what Jamie wanted. She wanted us to be strong and she wanted us to keep the faith, and I felt then that, at this point, that I was honoring her by moving on and having and being able to enjoy my life again, even with her not present. You can get over the hurt and the baggage that comes with grief and loss, but you never get over missing the person. That'll stay and it should. For some people, grief leads into a dark valley of depression, which encompasses a wide range of physical and emotional reactions. At this point, or any point in the grief process, we may experience difficulty sleeping or eating. We may feel tired and confused or unable to concentrate on simple tasks. We experience a tremendous flood of emotions associated with the depression of loss including sadness, loneliness, fear, and despair. Sometimes we express these feelings outwardly through tears and visible laments. I don't recall feeling self-pity as such. There was agony involved, though. Many times at the beginning I cried myself to sleep at night until I finally was able to give her up to God, and to trust Him, and to just pray that I would be able to be strong, to help her not to be afraid, and that was the prayer I think that God answered. This was a seismic shift in my family. I knew we'd never be the same. I knew I would never be the same, and that's actually part of where the fear came in. I became fearful that, of the life of having nothing but sorrow. I couldn't see how life could ever be the same again. I knew the past was irretrievable and all I could see stretching before me was sorrow. Some wage a more private battle, as was the case with Lewis. He acknowledged the " invisible blanket" that came between himself and the world around him and the smothering feeling that overtook him as Lewis' initial anger gave way to apathy. So Lewis talks about feeling like there's a blanket between him and life and that resonated with me in that I remember feeling numb and feeling somewhat in a fog and trying to find distance, so finding ways to distract myself from the pain or to find some way to avoid it, wanting to be away from it. You know, after the funeral, after all the sympathy cards stopped, and I had written all the thank yous, and my life returned to normal, I was back to work, going to church, eating, sleeping, everything seemed meaningless. Everything was put through the lens of " my mother was murdered." And nothing seemed to matter. I couldn't even taste my food. There is also, as Lewis describes, a "lazyness" that accompanies grief, in which we can no longer takes pleasure in those things we enjoyed before the loss. For me, the self pity, I began to see the signs of it, I just wasn't enjoying things anymore: sunny days, family, TV, movies, hikes. There just was a real sense of loss and that was leading to depression, which isn't good. That's not the way to go. After Tim had died, a couple months later, Kim Deal of the Breeders very kindly offered me the position of drummer in the band to go to New York and record an album. So I agreed and gave it my best shot, but the timing just wasn't right. I wasn't right. My heart wasn't in it. I was just becoming lazier and lazier and more apathetic. I eventually bowed out of the recording process and came back home to Dayton where I just kind of went into a slump, sleeping for days and about twelve to eighteen months time after Tim's death, I’d already put on over one hundred pounds. I wouldn't call any of my reaction lazyness, but there was a numbness that was there. It was very difficult to get things started. My priorities changed. Lt took a lot of energy just to do ordinary things. Lewis believed that God would not help a person through grief until that person was ready. He likened this to a drowning person that cannot be given help until he or she tires and is able to accept help without resistance. I was a youth pastor at that time and the biggest struggle for me was because of the position, I felt I had to act all in control and still be the leader, which meant I couldn't feel anything and it wasn't real. And it's kind of like holding everything in, the pressure eventually is going to get you in trouble. After a couple of years of mourning and grieving and a lot of sleeping, my father just put an ultimatum forth and said, " Look, something has to change. You have to do something. I’m willing to put you through trade school. I’ll buy you your first computer if you'll just go and you'll do this." So I reluctantly agreed, went, instantly picked up on it, excelled, graduated with honors, instantly got a job, and I’ve hated computers ever since. It is important to recognize when the symptoms of grief move beyond the normal range of emotions associated with loss. When a person feels that life is no longer worth living or cannot perform the daily functions of life for an extended period of time, it is time to seek professional guidance in working through grief. The counselor that I met with, and I do highly recommend grief counseling, he helped me so much one day when he finally, he just looked at me and he said, "Are you gonna fight?" And it hit me and I knew what he said was true. You can't just go into self-pity because eventually it will destroy your life and that's not the way to honor the death of somebody you really cared for. We must also remember that there is not a chronological time-line for how we cope with loss. Lewis acknowledged that, " Ln grief nothing 'stays put.' One keeps on emerging from a phase, but it always recurs." C.S. Lewis, he talked about the fear that's involved with loss. And for me, it was the initial shock fear, but then it was ongoing and it was more of a post traumatic stress type fear. I called it being haunted. It would just kind of stay around and then something would trigger it and you would really feel it. Certain events may trigger a recurrence of grief, such as the anniversary of when the loss occurred, the revisiting of familiar people or places, or the holiday season. These triggers, whether anticipated or unexpected, may rekindle unpleasant emotions that must be worked through once again. I always think of loss as cyclical. And so, things will come along and it reminds you of the loss. For example, becoming a dad. Now, all of a sudden, I’m reminded of things I never anticipated but, you know, the way I play with my daughter's different than the way I would have played with my daughter before the accident and the paralysis. And so, there's always occasions that come new that reveal to you different dimensions of the loss. The agonies for me were very much like what Lewis experienced. They were like ticking time bombs. The memories would occur at any time, but I learned to see the beauty in those memories rather than the agony. I don't think I’ve ever entirely gotten over the loss of Tim. Little things remind me of him, almost on a daily basis, especially musically. I hear a song, bands, some bands that actually come out and list Brainiac as an influence on their music, and that always gives me great satisfaction that he lives on, in that sense, but it also reminds me a little bit of my pain, kind of like a little picking away at a scab from time to time. And as far as Brainiac is concerned, there's always that wonder, that what if, what would have happened, so in that sense, that loss remains to this day. For many of us, the final leg in our journey with grief and loss brings acceptance, and with it, hope. Lt is here that we come to terms with our loss and find peace. So at the time of my accident, I know some of my friends were really anxious I would withdraw from life and be a little bit more reserved in who I was, and I was a person who lived life pretty fully before the accident. And I would say I’m still that person now. I live life really fully. I have a great family. I’m a new dad. I’m still an athlete. I hand cycle. I have a career and a ministry that's vital and meaningful, making a difference in my community. Before the accident, I never camped on a mountain, but since the accident, we camped up at 11,000 feet. So I’m still living a full life as much as I can. I know for me, the day my son was born, holding him in my arms. It was a real grace moment for me and the light began to shine again. That was the wake up for me and life was good. I don't have a moment when my grief subsided. It was really gradual for me, but I can remember just over time becoming able to laugh, able to notice beauty again, able to make plans again. And it was very subtle, and I really attribute it to the constancy of my husband and my friends who walked with me over time. It was a gradual process. The point at which we reach acceptance of our loss is also a time when we may begin to chart a new direction for our life, sometimes making drastic changes due to the lessons or realizations we've experienced in the grieving process. For me, I really learned what it was to be a Christian, what grace was all about because I’d come to the end of myself, and I know as a fact I’d stopped trying to make anything happen. And that's when I realized things started to happen. He started to move and I met Reggie and it wasn't long and we had a child. We named him Ian, which means gift, grace. And things were... rebirth, fresh for us in my life, and I wasn't working for it. That was the whole thing, I was trying to sabotage stuff as well, and yet He came through. That's why I know there's a God: to be able to go through something like that and yet end up on the other side saying no, you can go forward. The restoration, I could have never done it myself. If someone was to say, you know, how could you still believe, how could I not is my point? How could I not? Because I had to just completely let go and abandon myself and just say I cannot make it through this. You're gonna have to step in here. And, lo and behold, He did. He did. Absolutely. I know when Reggie came into my life it was very much a surprise, but I can see the hand of God in it because she put up with me during those times of doubting and sadness and yet she was right there and able to go through it with me. I don't think I could have done it alone. In fact, I know I couldn't have done it and I really thank God for her and what she means to me. Jamie's illness and death certainly changed my life in some ways. Beyond a doubt, my priorities in life have changed. She taught me, and God taught me through this experience, to start living life a day at a time, looking at things as they are rather than as I wanted them to be. I think it also taught me that the real meaning of these events in life is not in the event. It's in the way that you respond to those events and I think that's a lesson I’ll never forget. Promises and hope are things that I cling to. I don't really understand the reasons why things happen the way they do, but because Jamie had a faith in God and the hopes and the promises of God that she believed in, I can do no less than to have the same hope and faith that she did. Even though I’ve never completely gotten over that loss, my life has turned for the better. I’ve graduated from trade school, married, have a beautiful eight year old boy named Noah. I’m back in relationship with my Creator and I’m active in my church where I’m also playing drums now. Ironically, the colleague's comment that was so ridiculous at the time turned out to be true. I do think I’m a better therapist. Having been through this loss, I do have an empathy for folks who are grieving and can journey with them in that, but I still say to this day that I’d rather be a worse therapist and have had my mother these past 24 years. As we slowly come to terms with our grief, we accept that we may never find the answer for why loss has occurred. "We cannot understand," Lewis wrote. "The best is perhaps what we understand least." When Lewis says the best is perhaps what we understand the least, to me it is the hope of the eternal unknown. Francis Schaeffer wrote in one of his books that, we can have, with the Word of God true and unified knowledge, but we can't have exhaustive knowledge, the exhaustive knowledge that only God has. And I think there's sort of a relief there. I hope that there are answers, that there is understanding, just nothing that our finite, human minds can handle at this point in time. Part of life is discovering what the richness and meaning of life, and the places where it's the deepest is the places that we discover new and in ways we never anticipate. And I imagine that that's the mystery of who God is and the mystery of love and the mystery of how we experience love with, you know, our loved ones and our neighbors and our world and creation. As for Lewis, he survived his wife Joy by three years before succumbing to renal failure just shy of his sixty-fifth birthday. There's a passage in Grief Observed where it says, "As I rediscover my faith, I hope it's not another house of cards that will collapse when I face my own mortality." And I’m happy to say that his faith did not at all collapse as he faced his own mortality. He said, " I feel like a seed that's been planted and I’m just waiting for the gardener to come along and allow me to sprout and come into my true and new life." His existence before Joy, that of an intellectual scholar and writer, made Lewis a beloved person of the Christian faith, but it was his unexpected encounter with love and loss that made him a fully alive participant in the human experience. His " grief observed" became a new window to the world by which we can see the hope and promise of life after loss. ♪ I have nothin' left in me but, ♪ ♪ I have nothin' left in me but, ♪ ♪ a bleedin' heart that needs Your truth. ♪ ♪ Yeah, I have nothin' left in me but, ♪ ♪ a bleedin' heart that needs Your truth. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Search my heart, Oh God. ♪ ♪ Oh God. ♪ ♪ You call nothin' to be somethin'; ♪ ♪ You make art of ugly things, ♪ ♪ You take my life and ♪ ♪ You make it sing, ♪ ♪ Yeah, You make it sing, ♪ ♪ You make it sing, ♪ ♪ Praise.
