(FOGHORN BLOWING) (PEOPLE CHEERING) Hi. Hi. It's good to see you. Well, wish me luck, huh? I do, Gene. Of course, I do. Have everything you need? Uh-huh. You have traveler's checks, passport? Yes. Yes, I'm not three-years-old. I don't forget my passport. I just want you to have a good trip. Oh, I intend to have a great trip! Thanks for driving me down, huh? Who better than an ex-husband? I got custody of the car, didn't I? (FOGHORN BLOWING) I hate that sound. Oh, I love it! I love it! It's so exciting. See? There's the difference between us. Now, come on. Stand back there. I'm going to take your picture. First shot, first roll. Okay! There! Now you. Oh, okay. Damn it. Six weeks is too long. Well, I chose the cruise I wanted to. I can do that now. So let's just say goodbye as friends, okay? Write a lot. I will. I'll send pictures, too. All right. Have a good time, I guess. Thanks. Behave yourself. You smoke so much. No, no, no, no, and stop worrying. (FOGHORN BLOWING) All right, Gene, smile. (CAMERA CLICKING) Yeah. (MUEZZIN CALLING) BEA: Gene, we were afraid you'd changed your mind about the tour. Oh, what and miss three days of Roman ruins? Not a chance. No, I could hardly sleep all night. I was so excited. I want to see everything. Did you forget anything? Sun screen, film, bugs, uh, bugs stop, salt pill? Why do all men think that women have amnesia? Why is that? (HORN HONKING) Come in close. Be careful here. SYLVIA: Turkish ruins are the finest in the world, but our richest treasures have been stolen, plundered for museums all over the world. Now no foreign archeologist can take one object from a Turkish dig. Excuse me, could you tell us about, uh, Kemal Ataturk? Ah, I'm glad a woman asked this. You see, before Kemal Ataturk came to power in 1923, every woman wore the veil. If a woman did not please a man, she was nothing. He could just say "I divorce you" three times and it was done. (LAUGHS) I don't think that would have gone over in America. Our country is a modern democracy like your own, with all the benefits of Western culture. We are at the site of a Roman theater built in the second century before Christ was born. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Oh, look! Oh, these are beautiful. There is no time now, Mrs. LePere. Dinner is waiting. Tomorrow, okay? (MUEZZIN CALLING) Good morning. Oh, hi. Um, is it safe to walk down to the ruins alone? I thought I'd take my pictures now and then I won't hold up the group. This is a civilized country, Mrs. LePere. You are perfectly safe. Good, thank you. See you later. Gene, tour's starting! It's the lady with the tablecloths! Haven't you bought enough? But these are beautiful! I'll catch up! Okay. (SPEAKING TURKISH) No, thanks. No, thanks. Sorry. Excuse me. $10. No. You buy. No, thank you. (BUS HORN HONKING) Um... A-A-All right. There you are. Oh, no, no. I--I--I don't... $10. You buy. All right. But that's all! No more, no more. Okay? That's all. (SHIP HORN BLOWING) Madam LePere? Yes? I'm Monsieur Charnoff. I work with the shipping line and I will, uh, assist you through the Customs. Great. Thank you. (CHATTERING) You have nothing of value? No. Just, you know, a few souvenirs. It's, uh... Stone heads. CHARNOFF: Two stone heads. Oh, and another one, three stone heads. GENE: That one's marble. (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) Is there a problem? He asks you to wait here while the others go onboard. Why? I'm tired and I'm hungry. I want to go back onboard with everybody else. No, no, no, that is impossible. You see, the marble one, it might be valuable. Valuable? How could it be? I paid $20 for the three of them. Tell Customs they can keep them if they want, okay? (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) What did he say? He said would you recognize the person who sold it to you? Did you get a receipt? Well, look, no. They were street peddlers. Why? Well, did you go to a museum to have it examined? Well, of course I didn't! Now, why would I do that? Because it is the law. You must understand. The Turks, they are very sensitive on the subject of antiquities. Now this one might be ancient. There are very strict laws about smuggling such a thing from the country. I didn't smuggle! I was the one who pointed out it was different, right? Just, go on. Tell him that. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Where's he going with my passport? What's the matter? Problems? I don't know. I've been... I--I can't believe this. They say they won't let me back onboard. Oh, they damn well better! Just get, you know, the Captain or somebody to come down and talk to them for me. Now what is wrong? I don't know. I don't know what's being said for a start. Oh, I'm sure it's just nothing. Yeah. What's this then? You've got yourself into big trouble? They won't let me back onboard. Well, that's nonsense. We sail at 8:00. Think we'd leave without you? Madam LePere, I've persuaded the Customs to let you board your ship. Ah, all right. Isn't that great? Can I go now? Go and rest and freshen up and then you must return here. What? Is this some kind of a joke? They are still deciding what to do, but if they are copies, then there is no problem. What if it isn't a copy? That will be unfortunate. Smuggling antiquities is a serious crime. I did not smuggle! Did you tell that man that? Madam LePere, now I have promised them that if you leave here, you will return in two hours time. I must have your solemn word on it. My job depends on it, you understand? Charnoff handled it very badly, I'm afraid. But don't worry, Gene. We won't sail without you. Excuse me, sir. Mmm-hmm. Someone from the American Consulate here to see Gene. Oh, dear. CAPTAIN: There, you see. Your own people have come to take care of you. Mrs. LePere. Mr. Charnoff called me. I'm Ken Horton from the Consulate. How do you do? Oh, if you're here, I must really be in trouble. Well, smuggling is a serious charge, no doubt about it. But look, the Turks want their experts to check out the heads and the museum doesn't open until Monday, I'm afraid. So you may just have to wait here till then. Monday? I can't wait till Monday! What about the cruise? You can rejoin them at the next port. No, no, I don't... Mrs. LePere, listen to me. I'm sure you don't want to make an incident out of this. It could be embarrassing. All right? Now I've brought along an archeologist, a Turkish woman. She's gonna look at the heads tonight. Hopefully Customs will take her word. And in the meantime, let me see your passport. I need to get your legal name... I don't have my passport. They kept my passport. Okay. Ken! Yes, Salome? Mrs. LePere? Yes? I have seen the heads and I can assure you there is nothing to worry about. Really? Now one of them is ancient, but it is a very common type of no real value. Oh, great. So I have spoken to Customs and I am sure they're going to let this lady go. Oh, thank you, thank you! KEN: There you go. You're just wonderful! (SPEAKING TURKISH) As they say, good luck. Thank you. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Excellent, excellent. You'll be a citizen soon. Yeah, thank you so much. Madam LePere, I am so sorry. You cannot sail tonight. KEN: What are you saying? Now wait a minute! This lady just finished telling us that these... No, no, no, no. The Chief of Customs, he just said it doesn't matter what a young woman says. He believes you're guilty and you must stay here in Izmir until Monday. But, I mean, you just said... I know. Wait a second! Everybody's been telling me all afternoon that... (REPORTERS CLAMORING) (MAN SPEAKING TURKISH) (PHONE RINGING) Oh, Ken. Gene, good morning. Hi. How are you? Okay. Did you get any sleep? No. Oh. Have a seat. Thanks. So now the first thing that we have to do is get you a good lawyer. Lawyer? I haven't done anything wrong. Why can't I just tell them what happened? Gene, you don't know anything about the Turkish legal system, okay? You have to have somebody who knows his way around. Ken, this is crazy. I mean, don't I have any rights? What kind of a country is this anyway? It's a constitutional democracy, all right? One of the few in this part of the world, under military rule, bordering the Soviet Union. Therefore an extremely important friend and NATO ally of the United States. Well, then, why can't my government help me with this friend? I'm an American citizen! I should be able to... We'll do everything we can, of course. But this isn't the States, Gene. You broke Turkish law on Turkish soil. We at the Consulate are just as bound by that as you are. Let's go talk somewhere else, all right? Okay. KEN: Those are all competent local attorneys. Any one of them would do. Who's this? Burna Ha-Ha-Ha... Burhanettin Karaalioglu. Oh! He'd be my choice. 40s, medium price. He's out of town on the weekends, so you can't meet him, but it doesn't really matter. Well, it does matter. I want to meet him. I want to know someone's on my side. Someone I can talk to. It won't make any difference, Gene. What do you mean? The Turks do things their own way. You can't change them. Well! Well, if it's as cut-and-dry as all that, then what do I need a lawyer for at all? It may be just this cut-and-dry as that, Gene, but you still need somebody who knows the law and can speak to the court in Turkish. This is the way it has to be done. Come on. Take another look. I don't believe this. Isha... Isha. Emek... Gozukizil. Emek Gozukizil. What a name. Well respected. Good English. A reputation for being tough, smart and stubborn as a bulldog. But she's a woman. But? I'm a woman, too. Do they discriminate against women here? Sorry. No. Not if they're well-educated and professional. This one certainly is. Okay. Okay, I'll-- I'll meet her. Good, okay. We'll set it up. And, of course, I had no idea it was valuable and I didn't try to hide it. Motive is not so important in Turkish law. The heads were in your possession. Well, but isn't everyone innocent until proven guilty? You had the heads in your possession, then you must prove your innocence. Wow. Tell me about your family. Uh, what about them? Are they trying to help you? Do they have any friends in Washington who might intercede for you? Well, I--I haven't actually told them about this yet. I just keep hoping it'll still blow over and why worry them, you know unless I have to? You must call home immediately. Tomorrow a museum official will decide whether you must stand trial. The penalty is three to five years in prison. Five... I can't... I can't go to prison. But we must face this possibility. Well. Well, you're very blunt, Mrs. Goz... Gozukizil. Gozukizil. Do you wish me to represent you? Yes, I--I do. I will do my best. Thank you. Tomorrow will be a long day for you, so please try to get some sleep. And remember to set your clock back one hour. Turkey goes off daylight saving time tonight. The summer is over. Bye. (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) Excuse me. I'd like to explain. (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) What was all that about? This is all a mistake. Now... That's true. But she says you have to be tried under article 68 which carries a penalty of five to ten years. Five to ten... What're we gonna do? We go to the court now. There will be a hearing. You will be officially charged and I'll begin to do my duty. And hopefully, you will be released on bail. ISHA: You didn't tell the notary your parents' full names. Why was that? Well, my father was a very wealthy man and he was an art collector. Joseph Hirshhorn. And he endowed a--a big museum in Washington. The Hirshhorn Museum. Now I thought if anybody knew that, if, um, if they even heard the word museum... But your wealth and your connections can be very helpful, Gene. I am not wealthy. I'm not. I'm... I've always worked very hard to make my own way. I mean, the only thing I have left from Joe Hirshhorn is the ring he left me when he died and his stubbornness, I hope. GENE: Is there... How long will this take today? Do you know? No. I don't know, really. I could depend how busy is the schedule of the judge. Cigarette? Thank you. What does that say? No smoking. I came as fast as I could. How are you, Gene? Scared. (MAN COUGHING) (SPEAKING TURKISH) The court is ready for us now. Do this, Gene. A mark of respect. (SPEAKING TURKISH) He asks your name and address. Uh, uh, Gene LePere. (MAN TRANSLATING) Uh, 29 Covington Road, Mount Holly, New York. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Tell your story now, Gene. (MAN TRANSLATING) I bought the three heads because I--I wanted to buy something from the people of your country, not--not just from some shop. And, uh, I never tried to hide the heads. In fact, I was the one, at Customs, who said that one of them was marble. (MAN TRANSLATING) Your Honor, I am innocent. I--I--I never meant any harm. Please, just let me go home. Did he understand me? (SPEAKING TURKISH) I am sorry, Gene. What? You are to be taken to Buja Prison at once. What do you mean? This whole thing was a farce? Did you know all along I'd be convicted? What? No, you are not convicted. Gene, this was a preliminary hearing only. You will be held now in prison until your trial. No, I... Ken, Ken, you--you must get ahold of my family and--and Jim LePere, my ex-husband. We'll do everything we can. (SIGHS) Gene, I'm sorry this is as far as they'll let me go. I've written down a few words of Turkish for you to make things easier. Evet is thank you. Tesh a kur... I am sorry. Evet is yes. Tesh a kur is thank you. Anyway, it's all there. Now I'll come see you as often as they'll let me, maybe twice a week. Twice a week? How--How long till the trial? KEN: Not long, I hope. I'll bring you some American magazines and newspapers if you like. Isha, thank you. (MAN SPEAKING TURKISH) Jim gave me these. Would you? And--And my father left me that, so... I will take good care of them. I promise you. (SPEAKING TURKISH) What... It's all right. They must take your fingerprints. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Valium. He says to take it. Oh, no, I don't want that, thanks. You must do as he says. He's trying to help you. Gene, I must leave you now. No! When will I see you again? As often as I can. Tomorrow to be sure. You will get through this, hmm? It will be all right. (MAN SPEAKING TURKISH) Don't you... That's mine! Don't take it! That's mine! That's mine! You can't have that! Give it to me! No! Give it to me! Please. (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (BABY CRYING) (ALL CHATTERING) (SPEAKING TURKISH) I don't understand. (ALL EXCLAIMING) (ALL CHATTERING) (ALL EXCLAIMING) Does anybody here speak English? (EXCLAIMS) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (BABY CRYING) (ALL CHATTERING) Where, where's the bathroom? La-- Lavatory?

When can I get out of this place? I am trying to have you released on bail, but the court will not set a date for a bail hearing. Why not? What's wrong? Your case is unusual. I believe the judges don't know how to deal with it, so they do nothing. But for how long? Have you talked to my family? Yeah. Let's go sit down. I've... We've contacted them all. We've talked to them and told them you're okay. Okay? I'm not okay. I'm in prison! Your brother's contacting an American businessman over here. He thinks he can pull some strings for you. Are there strings to pull? What do you think? Right now, all we can do is petition the court and wait. I'm sorry, Gene. It could take weeks. It could be longer. Oh, my God. We're trying to arrange a visa so that someone from home can come visit you. Oh, I almost forgot. This is some American magazines and books. Gene, I wanted to tell you that everybody at the Consulate is really proud of the way that you've been handling this so far. Thanks. That's very encouraging. (WOMAN YELLING IN TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) American lady? How you like Buja Prison? You speak English. Same like you. Thank God! I thought I was going crazy. You spoke to me last night, huh? Last night I am in black hole for fight with guard. Well, then, someone else here speaks English. Right? Nobody else speak English. Only me, Lufti. What's your name? Gene LePere. Gene. You got cigarette? Yes. You can have some. Got more? I can get more. You got, uh, money? Some. Why? No money, you eat slop! Money, you eat with us. You know, we buy fruit, tea, meat even. Not worry, Gene. I take care of you. (LUFTI SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) She was here first. You are my American. You're special. You go first. (MUEZZIN CALLING) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SHUSHING) This is Neshe. This Sara. You give everyday 100 lira. Is American 40 cents. Man come here, sell food. If we no buy from him, we get sick. Neshe, me, we buy. Sara got no money. She cook for us. Wash clothes. You buy, share with Sara. Okay. (GASPS) (SPEAKING TURKISH) They never see, um, blonde hair American woman before. Yeah. You got husband, Gene? Well, I was married, but I'm divorced now. Why? Uh, well, we were married a long time and then we just started, you know, fighting over everything. You got babies? No babies. (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) So husband want, uh, more younger wife? He beat you, yes? No. No, he did not. Uh, we didn't want children and the divorce was my idea. In America a woman can do this? Mmm-hmm. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Why you in Buja Prison? I'm accused of smuggling, but it's all a mistake. Everybody here for mistake. They say I do a bad thing with dope. Not true. Neshe, Neshe here because her husband tell lies on her. Sara here because her husband do bad sex thing to her. She kill him. Some people here for steal. Sell babies. Some for fight government. Some too poor, no pay bills. Whole world right here, Buja, Hikmet say. Who's Hikmet? Hikmet, she be guard here. My very good friend. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Is Hikmet. You say, hello, Gene. Hikmet. (INTRODUCING IN TURKISH) You say-- You say " Gunaydin, Hikmet." Gunaydin, Hikmet. (SPEAKING TURKISH) She say okay. She say, you be good, not have trouble. (WOMAN SPEAKING TURKISH) (MAN YELLING ON PA) (ALL CLAMORING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON PA) LUFTI: Gene, soldiers come. What soldiers? Hurry up! We come back later. I have to get my contacts! No, no, no time now! I can't see! It's okay. Come back! (ORDERING IN TURKISH) (BABY CRYING) What do they want? They go in lockers. Look for dope. Better they not see your American yellow hair. Why? What would they do to me? Anything they want. They're soldiers, right? What should I do? Not worry, Gene. I take care of you. (WOMAN SCREAMS) Terrorist girls. They're students. They fight government. Do any of them speak English? I told you! Nobody speak English. Only me! Why you ask this? Um, I guess dreamed something. (MAN ORDERING IN TURKISH) (ALL MUTTERING) See, I told you I take care of you. I tell soldiers you my American. You special. (GUN FIRING) (ALL CLAMORING) What's that? Just terrorist girls. They not hurt you. They're down there. But can they get up here? Sure.

I work here with the women once a month. Write letters, that sort of thing. Could you use a winter coat? No, thanks. Give it to somebody else. They need it more than I do. Well, good luck to you. You really should take the coat, you know. Winter's getting close. It can get very cold here. Good luck to you. (GASPS) (BABY CRYING) (WOMAN SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) You talk Turkish now. Learned a few words. Know all about Buja, too. Not need Lufti no more. Lufti, I'm tired. I'm very tired. My lawyer's coming. I'm going inside. Hi, Isha. Mrs. LePere, I'm Edwin Gant. Your family hired me to help you get out of this mess. Oh, how do you do? Who, uh, hired you? Well, you did actually. That is, your brother did on your behalf. You see, I'm in business here and I have contacts all over Turkey. Are there contacts in Turkey that can help me? Ken, is that possible? It's not impossible. Well, I want to explore every possibility naturally. You understand though that Isha is in charge of my case. Oh, fine. No problem. I just want to assist in any way I can. I'll be doing some traveling. Shouldn't cost you much though. Uh, expenses, per diem and a small fee. Mmm-hmm. Uh, is there any news? I go to the court again next week for bail hearing. I feel it will be granted this time. Once you are out on bail, you can wait for your trials in the hotel. Trials? You mean there could be more than one trial? There could be many trials. Don't worry, Gene. I have friends in the Turkish government that can get you out of here in a week. You sick, Gene? I tell Hikmet. You go to hospital. I'm just not hungry. You--You can have my share. (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (WOMEN SHOUTING) (ALL CLAMORING) (SCREAMING) Gene, my dear, what happened? Fight in the cell. Um... Did they set the bail hearing? No, I'm sorry. There has been another delay. But I know you will be out of here soon. Soon? Every night they give us sleeping pills. I hide mine. They could set me free. Gene, you must not think that way. But I do. In the beginning, I'd wake up every morning and think this was all a dream. But it isn't. It's my real life. And I don't want it anymore. Gene, you sleep? Oh, no. You sick? Maybe I come back another time. No, Neshe. Please don't go. Talk to me, please. I come ask your favor, Gene. Hmm? No tell Lufti. Why doesn't anybody stand up to that woman? She--She--She bad, Gene. She--She go crazy some time. Take pills and they say she kill a woman once. No make her mad on you. Please, Gene. You write letter for me. To my American husband? Yes, yes, of course. Okay. Now, what's his name? To Yilmas. Yilmas. Yilmas Atagun. Atagun. He American soldier, come Turkey, take Turkish name. Oh. What's his address? Buja Prison. You're both in here? Yilmas have wife in U.S. One day she come Izmir. He say, we put hashish in her clothes. You call police. I say no, but, see, police believe wife. So you did it? When woman love her man, she do for him all things what he wants. Not that way in America? America is different. Oh, my God! I don't believe it! What happened to you? (STAMMERING) I fell, I fell. Can't we sit down? I just came from the Consulate. They're gonna take me to see the head honcho here. He'll listen to me. I promise. Oh, Jimmy, don't make me promises like that. You don't know! I know I'm gonna get you out of here somehow. (HIKMET LAUGHING) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (WOMEN YELLING IN TURKISH) (SPEAKING TURKISH) (YELLING) (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) (SPEAKING TURKISH) Those scars on her arms. Did she try to kill herself? Many times. Always they bring her back. Sir, Gene is incapable of breaking the law. I have with me affidavits from all kinds of people (TRANSLATING) attesting to her excellent character, her honesty, especially. She's never been in trouble in her life. (SPEAKING TURKISH) He says, she was in possession when arrested. In the eyes of the law she is guilty. The law is wrong! Steady, Jim. Isha, don't translate that. All I'm asking, sir, is that you give her an immediate bail hearing. (ISHA TRANSLATING) She has a thyroid problem. She needs the care of a doctor, special medication. (SPEAKING TURKISH) He's sorry, but none of this is to the point. Tell him I came prepared to pay any fine, anything he thinks is necessary. She's innocent. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Her innocence is for the court to decide. And he is not open to bribes. I'm trying to appeal to him as a decent human being who believes in justice. Mr. LePere, I do not need lessons in justice from you! When the time comes, Gene LePere will be given a bail hearing! She may or may not be granted the bail! That is for the court and the judge to decide! Not you! Damn this place! KEN: Jim! You... Stop it! Give me that. Come on! Put that down! That is enough! ISHA: Mr. LePere! This meeting is dismissed! Get this man out of here. Out, out! (DOOR OPENING) Jimmy? Gene, Gene, I'm sorry. What happened? I lost it with the guy. Now they're gonna put me on the next plane out of here. I'm gonna kiss her goodbye, all right? They don't understand that. Everybody understands. I'm not gonna stop fighting. I'm gonna see everybody. Don't give up hope. Pretty hard to keep up hope when everything seems against it. Honey, that's what hope is. How long will you be gone? Two weeks. I hate to go with the bail hearing still hanging fire, but... By the way, have you heard from Gant? Oh, as far as I know, he's still traveling around the country talking to influential people. Yeah. Ken, I have to, uh, get out of here. I know you do, Gene. No, I mean, escape. Gene, don't even say that. There must be a way. You have contacts. T-T-There's a man who delivers vegetables here in a truck. Now he could get me to a border. I know it sounds crazy, but... It's impossible. All right? Just put it out of your mind. I warn you, Gene. I will do everything in my power both officially and personally to keep you from it. (WOMEN CHATTERING) (BABY WHIMPERING) Hey. You got pills, Gene? Get out of my bunk. What's the matter? Not friends with Lufti no more? This is my bunk. I didn't ask you here. Oh, you regular prison woman now. Know all about Buja rules. You give me pills, Gene. Go away. You want to fight me, Gene? I like fight with American lady. Be careful, Gene. She crazy. You no speak English to my Gene! You leave her alone. You give me orders, Gene? You boss in Buja Prison now? I am no boss. Neither are you. You got pills, Gene. You give me pills. Or I take. No, you won't. I kill you! Oh, no. I'm not going to die in here. This place is not going to kill me. And neither is the likes of you. (SNIFFLING) So come on, Lufti. Come on. Try me. You not my special American woman no more. Hi. Gene, great news. They have finally set a bail hearing date. When? On Wednesday. Then we can apply for a trial date later this winter. You must dress well. Look like the woman you are. Fine. Brave American lady who would never stoop to steal or break the law. I heard I'd be handcuffed. Is that true? I'm sorry. I'll go out and buy you new clothes. I guess you better. (SPEAKING TURKISH) She say you take her ring. It give you luck today. Oh. (SPEAKING TURKISH) You get ready for court, Gene? Uh-huh. We help you, okay? (ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) (REPORTERS CLAMORING) (SPEAKING TURKISH) PHOTOGRAPHER: Mrs. LePere, one up here! Isha. Gene. (EXCLAIMS) Look, Gene. Huh? Oh, I missed them so much. Thank you. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Hi. Well, I've done my best to get this bail hearing. Talked to everybody I could get my hands on. Now, Gene, if you just cool down and play it right. Cool down? Well, your family's been worried about you, you know, uh, your state of mind. They've been hearing rumors that you're not exactly with it. Where did they hear that from? Well, from me actually, but, uh, I heard it from Ken Horton. Well, you can tell them to stop worrying. I'm with it. Hi. Sorry I'm late. My plane was delayed. (MAN SPEAKING TURKISH) ISHA: The court is ready for us now. (MAN TRANSLATING) Your Honors, in my country we don't have the same problems that you have in Turkey. Our antiquities are not as, uh, old or beautiful or as valuable as yours. And people don't come from all over the world to study them. And--And if someone wants to own one, they can just buy it, uh, in a museum shop or at a regular store without any special permits or receipts. So the idea of smuggling antiquities is unknown to us. 'Cause it's not illegal to own, or buy or sell or even export them in the United States. And no one in my country would expect it to be illegal anywhere else in the world. (DOOR OPENING) (WOMEN MURMURING) (WOMEN SPEAKING TURKISH) Oh. It brought me luck. Thank you. (SPEAKING TURKISH) See, I told you you'd be free. Well, my real trial's not until January. I might be back in Buja. No, no. No, you no come back. You go home, Gene. I wish it for you. Listen, buy treats for everybody, will you, please? Okay. (SPEAKING TURKISH) Well, bye. LUFTI: Gene. I your first friend. Going to miss you. I'm gonna miss all of you. (WOMAN SPEAKING TURKISH) Isha. Oh, Isha. (EXCLAIMS) ISHA: Feel better? Oh, I do. I really do. Thank you. It is good to see you smile. Yeah. It feels good. I'm going to burn all those clothes I wore in Buja. Tomorrow we go shopping, right? All right. Thank you. (EXCLAIMS) I can't believe I'm out of there. I would rather you were out of the country. Yeah, well, me, too. But I have to stay for the trial, right? Your bail was set so low. $1500. I keep wondering if the authorities are hoping you forfeit bail and escape. What? Why would they do that? It could save them going through a trial that could be embarrassing. You being American. Then why wouldn't they just let me go? Because you have been charged and they must follow through. But if I try to escape and then it could be very dangerous, couldn't it? Dangerous to stay as well. Gene, you will almost certainly be found guilty. That means years in prison. But I--I can't leave. They kept my passport. I have asked them to return it. If they do, it may mean that I am right. But if you're wrong and I'm caught... Huh? I mean, how can we be sure? That photograph, that's my husband and I. Just one year ago. Two weeks later, I was a widow. There is very little in life that is sure. I'll need some cash. Isha's been working for me for ages now and she hasn't received a cent. I'm way ahead of you. Ah. 30,000 lira. Use it for your hotel and meals and you can give Isha a small retainer if you want. Ah, I'll need more than that. What for? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Gant. Is this your money? Well, no. The Consul advanced it from your trust account. Then it's my money. I'll need more. Well, that's all I could get. Anyway, you got nothing to spend it on. Now you're not thinking of skipping bail, are you? Now that would be a big mistake. It's entirely up to me, now, isn't it? Look, I went to bat for you with the Turks, remember? Nothing would make us look worse than for you to run like a common criminal. And if you got caught... Now promise you'll stay till the trial and, uh, I'll get you the cash you want. Okay? GENE: Oh, Isha! Great news. What? Your passport. You were right! I can't believe it. Oh, look at this. What's written across my picture? The bearer has been detained and is to be held for trial. It's useless. (RINGING) Hello? NANCY: Hello? It's Nancy Rust here. Do you remember me? We met in the yard at Buja. The winter coat? Oh, yes. Of course, I remember you. I heard you were out on bail. Would you like some company? Well, I'd love it. Well, what I really need is a new passport. Do you know how I can get one? I could ask my brother. He'd know. From your Consulate, I imagine. What's wrong with the old one? Oh, the Turks marked it so that I can't leave the country. It's useless. Well, even if you got a new passport, you'd have to have an entry stamp, you know. Entry stamp? You get it when you come into the country to prove you're legal. Oh, yeah. And when you leave, they check to see it's there. And of course, then there are the lists. Lists? Yes. Every airport and railroad. Every port of entry. Your name and picture are probably there right now. Oh, God. I pay your fees, Mr. Gant. Now I want you to just stop all this traveling around and help me. I need a passport. That is impossible right now. Ken's on vacation. He's the only one who can sign passports. Well, I don't believe that! He told me so himself. Well, business doesn't stop just because Ken goes on vacation! There must be someone around here who can sign it! Because you want there to be? I'll tell you exactly what I want. I'm tired of wondering whether or not you are with me or against me. Pack up, Mr. Gant. That's what I want. You're fired. GENE: Gant says that a new passport has to wait for you, so... KEN: People get passports whether I'm here or not. A new passport needs an entry stamp apparently. How do I go about that? That's easy. Where did you enter? Alanya. All right. Okay, it's routine. You, um, you need a letter in Turkish, of course, saying that you're an American citizen, who has received a replacement passport that you entered Turkey at Alanya on such-and-such a date. Mmm-hmm. Then the letter goes to Alanya to the City Hall. They verify the date of entry and validate the letter and your passport's in order. Well, that sounds doable. Yeah. The only thing is that Alanya is 10 hours by car. So I guess your best bet is to hire a good driver and send him to Alanya with the letter. Oh, you'll need a new passport photograph, too, so... Yeah. Thank you. Get that to me in a day or two and I'll have your new passport before I go out of town. Where're you going? When? Just to the embassy in Ankara for a few days on Monday. What do you need it for, Gene? Well, if I, uh, do some traveling around the country or if I'm stopped, I'll need one, won't I? Right. Okay. I'll get you the passport, but I want you to promise me something. If you're thinking of bailing out of the country, you're coming to me first. We'll talk about it, okay? Sure. GENE: Even Jimmy wouldn't know me. (SIGHS) What time is it? Don't fuss. (EXCLAIMS) My brother's just about landing in Ankara now. Then he has to contact his friend in security to see if your name is on the list there. I can't thank both of you enough. Please. Now, you know there are only two airports where you can get a flight out of Turkey. Istanbul has computers, so you're sure to be listed there. But in Ankara, well, they're so out-of-date, you do have a chance. So I should fly to Ankara and then get a flight to Munich. Buy a round-trip ticket so that way I can say I was planning to come back. If I get caught. (PHONE RINGING) That'll be John now. Get your message. Hello? JOHN: Hello. This is your friend in Ankara. The weather is clear. That's wonderful! Good luck on your vacation. Thank you very much! I'm not on the list! Where's the letter to, uh, to Alanya? (MUMBLING) Oh. Thanks. You're very brave, Gene. (SIGHS) The driver will have to get this back to me by Monday night. It will be very late. It's a long trip to Alanya. I don't care how late it is. You will pay now the 70,000 lira? I will pay now the 30,000 and the remainder when the driver brings me back the document. If you wish, Madam. I will be away for a few days. We could see each other next week if you wish. Well, I'm going to, uh, be doing some traveling myself in the next week. If anything should happen to me, you know, an accident or something like that, would you just give my clothes and things to the women in Buja? And some money? What could happen to you? Well, anything to anybody, isn't that what you said? I will call you on Monday. But let me say to you now what we say when we say goodbye. May all be well with you, Insha Allah, God willing. God willing. Isha, I'm very grateful to you, you know, for all your help. And your friendship. You are the first American woman I ever knew. I always thought, forgive me, they would be spoiled babies. But if they are anything like you, they are amazing. (SIGHS) GENE: The driver should be getting here any minute. And tomorrow you'll be free. Yeah. I've forgotten what it's like to just sit in a room, you know, unafraid, not fearing that the next minute somebody might just come in and take everything away from me and there'd be nothing I could do about it. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? JOHN: This is John. I'm afraid you'll have to cancel your plans, Gene. The weather's changed in Ankara. What? Don't come. It's not clear here anymore. You understand? Gene? I--I understand. Thank you for calling, John. They've got my name. Gene, I'm so sorry. I can't turn back now. But if they catch you, that could mean life in prison. And if I stay, five, maybe ten years in that place! No, oh, no. Do they always look at the lists at the airport? I don't know. If that driver shows up tonight with that letter, I am leaving tomorrow as planned. I am! Hello, front desk? It's Gene LePere. Um, has anybody brought a package for me yet? MAN: No, Mrs. LePere. Well, if somebody does, um, I know I've told you this before but, um, I--I am still awake. Okay? Yes, Mrs. LePere. Thank you. (PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hello. A messenger has just come with a package for you, Mrs. LePere. Thank you. Do you have something for me? (SPEAKING TURKISH) Could, uh, could you read that to me, please? Tell me what that says. Well, it says that Mrs. Gene LePere entered the port of Alanya as a passenger of the British ship, Sea Princess on the 8th of September, 1983. Oh, great. Thank you. And that's for you and thank you very much. Good night. Good morning. I'm planning a few days of tourist travel but I'd like to keep my room. Is that all right? I'll pay in advance. American Embassy, please. (KNOCK ON DOOR) KEN: Come in. Gene? Hi, Ken. Um, I promised you that I would let you know if I ever made any plans about leaving. Well, uh, I'm going home. No, Gene, listen to me. You will really get yourself into hot water. Please. If you stand trial and were convicted even, we could probably get you sent home on a prisoner exchange in a few months. No. Probably isn't good enough. That's better than being caught in an illegal exit, Gene. You could spend your life in Buja. It's my risk, isn't it? I--I do need your help. I can't help you, Gene. You know that. Well, could you just get my plane tickets for me? My picture's probably at the counter... I'm sorry, Gene, I can't do that. All I need is a round trip ticket to Munich! That way if I get caught, then I can always say I was planning to come back! It won't incriminate the government. No. Um... Could I, um, stay here until it's plane time? I mean, the airport scares me. That's no problem. Thanks. Our bus will be going to the airport, Mrs. LePere. Some of our employees are on that Munich flight, too. You could probably ride along. Thanks. We'll bring you something to eat. And I've got some American magazines to keep you company. Thanks, Ken. I read all those in Buja. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Okay, these are the rules. You're gonna get off by yourself and go inside. You're not to look at or make contact with any of our people. Now, I'll be there to see everyone off, but remember, If anything happens, you don't know me and I don't know you. Okay. Agreed. (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA) Uh, I need a, a round trip ticket to Munich, please. You have passport, please? WOMAN ON PA: Your attention. please. This is your final boarding call for flight 459 to Belize. Now departing from gate 75. Your attention please. This is your final boarding... Excuse me, please. You are smoking? What? Smoking or non-smoking? Oh, either one. (WOMAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) Your attention, please. This is your last call for flight... (SPEAKING TURKISH) I'll just... MAN: Excuse me. We have met? No. No, I don't think so. I am sure I know you, Mrs... Please. What is your name? Um... Excuse me. My husband's waiting for me. He says he knows me. What should I do? He probably just saw your picture in the papers. Ken, please. Please, I'm gonna ask you a favor now. Please, let me pass through with your group. I've been watching. It's the only way the soldiers don't look at the lists. What do you mean pass through with my group? Just put my passport in with theirs. If anybody catches me, I'll say I did it. I put it there. Nobody knew. I won't endanger anybody. I promise. Gene, why're you putting me in this position? I work for the United States government. Ken, you've been saving our government's ass all along! Now I'm gonna save mine! I'm so sorry I'm late. The taxi didn't come. Mr. Horton told me to meet him here. Okay, fine. This way, please. (MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA) WOMAN: What's taking so long? I don't know. (PILOT ANNOUNCING ON INTERCOM) Dear, is something wrong? I'm free. What? I'm fine. I'm fine.
