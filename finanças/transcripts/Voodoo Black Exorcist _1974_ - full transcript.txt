[waves splash] [romantic music] [water splashes] [groans and grunts] [tribal music] [crowd chants] [tribal music] [crowd chants] - [Gatanebo] Happenings and life repeat themselves. Within a thousand years, 2,000. Gatanebo will seek Kenya, blood will be spilled, terrible things will happen again and everything will start again. Begin again. [rockets explode] [soft music] [thunder booms] [groovy music] [machinery whirls] - Alright, Freddie you will stay and watch over the sarcophagus, you'll have to sleep here too. I'm sorry but it's necessary. [horn blows] [sultry music] - Sophia, how long have you been working for me? - Well as your secretary for three years and as you companion for two. - Why don't we get married? The Caribbean is perfect for a honeymoon. - Accompanied by a mummy? - I don't think it will bother us. - Oh don't you think we're alright as we are? What do we have to change things for? [unintelligible voices] [sultry music] - Albert you should be friendly with Dr Kessling, I want him to show me the mysterious sarcophagus. Albert do I have do everything? Why are you bringing me another whiskey? Do you think I'm a drunk of something? I asked you for a gin, a double. - What kind of a chain did you say you had? [mumbles] - Barbados, Curacao, the Virgin Islands, the best hamburgers in the world. I have a slaughterhouse in Chicago. - That's very interesting. - You're a dancer? - Can you tell? - Your husband? - Oh he isn't my husband and soon I'll get tired of him, he's always jealous. - He's right to be. - I guess so. [tribal music] - Tonight the cards speak in a strange form, you know what it means? Violence, blood. - I can't believe you're serious. - Don't you believe in cards? - In the 20th century you can only believe in science don't you think? [tribal music] - Incredible, this card predicts an unexpected visitor! - On the high seas? - There's no mistake about it. [tribal music] An unknown passenger will join us before we reach port. Isn't it exciting? Albert I think you should warn the captain. - Immediately my dear. [tribal music] [cat screeches] - Can I help you? - Oh I was looking for you, what's that? - It's a sarcophagus, I'm guarding it. I have the captain's permission. [tribal music] - Just think of it, that same rhythm was sounding thousands of years ago in the jungles of Nigeria. And the movements of that dancer are the exact copy of ancient ancestral dances. - What do they signify? - Your head will burn and your body will dissolve into nothingness. Wait for the spirit to descend, head sing, feet are bare, the body's dressed in white. Chained to the ground the spirits await. - [Gatanebo] We have no eyes but we see, nor ears but we hear your voice. Nor legs but we ascend to heaven as particles of God. [mysterious music] [cat meows] [mysterious music] [cat screeches] [mysterious music] [tribal music] - Oh it's so exciting, what rhythm, what vitality. Dr Kessling will you take me to see the mummy later? We'd like to so much, really we would. Wouldn't we Albert? Wouldn't we dear? [tribal music] [romantic music] [tribal music] [intense music] - Sylvia I just received this wire. Dr Craig is on his way to meet us, I only know him through his work. I must admit he's the foremost authority in matters of African primitivism. - No, after this conference in Porta Prince what do you plan to do? - Plans? Continue working, write a book, the same as always. - That's what's wrong, same as always. I hope you won't be needed me anymore, I'm leaving for New York alone. - You've been acting strangely this week. - As a secretary or as a lover? I've spoiled you. I work for you all day long and when you feel like making love I'm also at your disposal. No, that's not enough for me. - I have to show that sarcophagus to that nutty old lady, I promised her I would last night. Please don't leave me alone with her, please. - Captain! Captain! Has anyone see the Captain?! Albert, call the Captain! - Captain. - Mrs Thorndyke. - How many passengers do we have? - 340. - 41, we have a stowaway on board. My cards say 341 and they're never wrong, never. - I'll keep it in mind Mrs Thorndyke, don't worry. - Oh thank you, thank you so much. - That's curious, maybe we have to search the ship. - You're not going to pay attention to Mrs Thorndyke. - No I am to the other passenger. Last night someone knocked him out and also took his clothes. - We calculate that the sarcophagus is approximately 1,000 years old, even in though it is perfectly preserved. The natives never buried corpses in their sarcophagi, rather live persons submitted to a special treatment. According to the voodoo ritual when a man dies he turns into eternal particles. - Albert I would like to get a sarcophagus like this to rest in eternally. - I'll do my best honey. - Do you want us to open it? - No. - Why not? - It'll be dangerous, we should not do it. - Miss, this sarcophagus has been opened on several occasions already. - Johnny don't let them, tell them what could happen. - Let's go. - I warn you, don't do it! - What foolish superstitions as nice as educated as the dead are, right Albert? - Yes dear. - [Dr Kessling] Observe that it can be opened from the inside as well as from the outside. - How marvelous, how splendid, he must have been a very interesting man. - His story is written in these printings, but we haven't deciphered them yet. - [Dr Kessling] Notice his ring, made in the shape of an asp. It contains bits of Carrari, that activate at 98.6 degrees, the blood temperature. It's pure gold, and it's value is incalculable. [mysterious music] [boxes crash] [mysterious music] - [Gatanebo] You'll do what I want, all I order, all Gatanebo orders. [mysterious music] [screams] - Albert, did you hear that voice?! It froze the blood! - That was me, I was dreaming of you. [clanking] [romantic music] [gasps] [tribal music] - Nine. [chuckles] Seven. - You can see the future, I wouldn't want to bet against you. - If you try number four will come out three times. Do you know what that means? - What does it mean? - That someone will have their vengeance. You still have a chance, shoot. - Who are you? What do you want? - You'll know soon, shoot. [tribal music and chants] [mysterious music] - I think it occurred around two or three o'clock in the morning, since the head hasn't been found we can suppose it fell into the sea. The cut was made with a wavy bladed knife, magnificent, worthy of medieval headsmen but ghastly. - Did you wire the police in Kingston? - Yes Sir. - We'll have to search the ship, maybe Mrs Thorndyke's cards were right. - I knew it Albert, I knew it. The cards announced there was a criminal hiding amongst us. I am never wrong, the cards said so. - Robert did you enter my cabin last night? - No, maybe I should have. - For us it will be easy to find out who did it. - Sure sure, very easy. - A very simple invocation. - Forget it. - To what end? - It would be easy for us but we shouldn't do it, it's too dangerous. - So many gloomy faces over a little blood. In my business I see that sort of thing every day. Hey boy, I want a drink, the usual. Thanks. [speaks in foreign language] - If you take a ride around my Chicago slaughterhouse you'd see. - Will you shut up, I'm not able to stand you today. - [Captain] Your attention please, this is the Captain speaking. As a consequence of the events occurred last night I must take certain security measures. Beforehand I apologize for the inconvenience to the passengers, we must make an extensive search of the ship, holds, store rooms, life boats, crew quarters. The passenger cabins must also be searched. Tomorrow we'll dock in Kingston but I must beg the passengers and crew not to disembark until we receive instructions from the police department in Kingston. - Oh no, Dr Craig will be waiting at the airport, I must disembark! - This card announces death just as I've always told you, the cards are never wrong and this one say's someone's half dead, maybe that refers to you Albert. [tribal music and chanting] - Dr Kessling what are they doing? - Huh? - What are they doing? - They're invoking Bushongo, he that reigns over all the lohas. - The lohas? Lohas, what are lohas? - Spirits that are waiting to be avenged. - We better stop that. - Please don't, please. Now the loha of the dead man might posses anyone of us and force us to do certain things. He will seek the guilty one and then stop there. [tribal music] [romantic music] [tribal music] Sylvia, what happened? [tribal music] - As of this moment your dances and your rights are prohibited aboard this ship. Totally prohibited absolutely. Search the sarcophagus, open it please. - The knife was here last night, you gave it to me so that I could make a copy of the signs on the sarcophagus. You wouldn't think I went back to the sarcophagus do you? - I can assure you that the crime was committed with that knife but by whom and why? - I told you, someone had been in my cabin! I heard him close to me. - Sylvia, why did you go to the sarcophagus? - I don't know. - But what did you feel? - At first I was trembling, I tell you I tried very hard to regain control of my body, I was being pushed by a strange force. I couldn't stop it. - Continue. - I had the impression of being turned inside out into a state of no gravity. I began to wonder who I was or what I was doing. I couldn't tell anything, I don't know why. It's all so strange now. - Try to remember, please try. - I was certain I wasn't alive, I wasn't sad, I didn't care. I just waited. - For what? - I don't know, something that would happen, absurd and terrible at the same time. Now I feel, I feel I'm still waiting. - For what? - My own death. [mysterious music] [intense music] - Your killer is dead, I bring proof of my vengeance. Oh Kenya, most beloved of women. [tribal music] [screams] [grunts] [whistle blows] - My God this heat is really unbearable, Muchatcho. - Yes? - Will you get the list of passengers to disembark Porta Prince? - Yes. - Sheriff? - Yes. - Sheriff Dr Kessling wants to go to the airport. - I don't see why not, let him go. - Thank you. - Captain I think you return the passports to the passengers. - But the criminal is surely on board. - Oh this is very involved, let me handle this. - Captain what do I do with this Sir? - What do you think? To the laboratory son, to the laboratory. Summarizing, a steward is decapitated. The next night his head shows up in one of your passengers cabin, several men have a terrible struggle with a suspect but he vanishes. Well Captain you may sail when you like. - Aren't you going to do anything else? - You see I have a system, when I don't have a lead I drink gin. And wait. - With this photo you'll have no trouble recognizing Dr Craig, I'd rather wait here. [engine revs] [cheerful music] - Dr Craig, Dr Kessling is waiting for you. - Thank you. [cheerful music] Where is Dr Kessling? - This way. [cheerful music] - Where's Dr Craig? What does this mean, who are you? - Who do you think I am? Hello Dr Kessling, you recognize me. - No it can't be. - You see I can be of more use then Dr Craig ever could have been to you and your studies of voodoo. - The ships about ready to sail Dr Kessling, your colleague from New York? - Dr Craig, Mr Domínguez. - I hope we have no more incidents, maybe we'll meet again in Porta Prince, gentlemen. - Your documentation is truly amazing. But Dr Kessling and I disagree with you on your theory of the Pantheus in the voodoo religion. - Why? - They never invoke a single god, rain or shine, good or bad, all depends on the loss. - You know nothing, the lohas are intercessors between men and God, God is lost in the universe and can't be invoked, he's only a threat. - [Sylvia] That's not what you said in your last book. - However that's how it is. [romantic music] Sylvia is your name now? - Now? It's always been the same. - My that's strange, you deserve a prettier one. - And what do you think my name should be? - Three phases are found in every voodoo ceremony, call to the gods, arrival of the gods and sacrifices and offerings to the gods. - Your normal state, last long? - Variable, I also depend on the sun and various cosmic factors. - You speak English well. - Three centuries in museums, I have learned many many things. - What do you feel when the process begins? - Pain! It's going to drive me mad. - You killed the steward in one of those moments. - In infinite time what must happen happens. - I trust you won't do such a thing again. - We had an agreement, I kept my part, you just see that you keep yours. Last night I lost Radha's sacred ring, I want you to find who has it. - Where are you going? - Someone's thoughts call to me. [romantic music] Do you feel I am different? - In a way yes. - You will see that I am not. The sea is beautiful, isn't it? - Yes it is. - However there are many creatures in the center of the earth that have never seen it. Imagine how they'd feel if put here now. That's how I felt when I found you again. - You have a way of courting a woman. - That's not my intention. - You said something about finding me again, have we met before? - In Cairo's archeological museum. You and Dr Kessling were looking at the sarcophagus that you have now. - Something wrong? - No, no, go away. [intense music] [glass shatters] [furniture crashes] The ring, did you find who has it? [wheezing breathing] - Albert what's wrong? - A terrible monster was right here. - Nonsense, let me go back to sleep. [whistle blows] - Porta Prince, home at last. - You stay at the ranch? I always go there. - Maybe. - What's wrong Albert? We're in a Porta Prince and you look worse then ever. - Excuse me, if you should need anything from Ed Warn you can always reach me at Ed Warn's, the best hamburger business in the world. - Sylvia, don't be too friendly with Dr Craig. - Why not? Where is he? - I'm here next to you. Kenya my only love, your face glows like a newborn star. I know that having lost you for a thousand years I could not find another like you. Until I find you again Kenya, my only love. - Beautiful poem, who wrote it? - Someone many years ago, alone on a beach. One night when the god's allowed him a few seconds of happiness. It's the translation of the inscriptions card on the inside of the sarcophagus. - Does Dr Kessling know you've already translated the inscriptions? - Dr Kessling has many things to learn and so do you. - Me? You say that as a threat. - Threats are only words, but what must happen is almost here and nothing can change it. But you have nothing to fear. - Dr Kessling. - How are you? - Terrible, moody, perplexed. It's so damn hot here don't you think. - Any news on the death of the steward? - I've established that someone onboard did it, logic huh. The other case we have is worse, it was terrible. The day you arrived the passenger from flight 704 was run over. - He was killed? - Yes a bulldozer, no identification. By the way you went to the airport to meet a passenger from that flight didn't you? - Yes, Dr Craig. But I assure you he was very much alive. - Dr Craig. - There he is. - Did you know him? - Why yes, of course. - I won't bother you, I'll just wait a for an error, a false step. Anyway it's too damn hot to do anything don't you think? We'll meet again Dr Kessling. - Adios Inspector. - Now you're talking strange, why do you look at me? - It's the only way I know how. Sylvia, I can't get used to calling you that. - On the ship you never told me what you thought my name should be. - Kenya. [tribal music] - You cannot buy them, you can only discover them. [tribal music] - A scientist in a dancer's dressing room, come in. Did she invite you? - No. - She did me, I could ask you to leave but I believe in giving a fair chance, we'll wait and let her decide alright? The loser leaves in peace, what about it? What a woman with some body. [intense music] When one of us loses, we leave in peace. What a body. [grunts] [tribal music] [chants] [screams] [slaps and gasps] [tribal music] [pounding footsteps] - It's un-doubtable that these men brought by force from their native Africa to be sold as slaves brought with them their rights, beliefs, dances, religions, which they firmly implanted in Haiti and Trinidad. I'm going to show you a sarcophagus that is thought to be 1,000 years old. Miss, would you open it, please? You're looking at the body of a mummy that is. [screams] - Albert you're spilling your coffee, what?! - That monster, that mummy was in our cabin! - That's impossible Albert, it's much too old, but I'm glad to see that you're starting to believe these things at last. - I have never seen a man in such a state, terrible terrible, he has more than six fractures. Head, arms, jaws, ribs, ankles and it looks like he's been strangled, has broken vertebrates. But even without all this he would have died anyway. - It's a shame, the best hamburgers in the world, what did you say? - We found some of the murder's blood, the strangest blood I ever saw. Well that blood has a certain virus that would have killed him in a few hours. I've sent a sample to the lab for further analysis and we'll have to wait for the outcome. - And the dancer? - She was hit but not hurt. Complicated case huh? - Too much so, I'm a homemade cop, a little clumsy and a little old. Beautiful girl your secretary. I retire in a few years. - Oh, so what is your reason for telling me all this? - So you'll forgive my extravagant ideas. I got it in my head that our Dr Craig is not Dr Craig. - Are you accusing me of something? - I wouldn't dare Dr Kessling, you are an important man and I'm only a fat old cop. I only wanted to give you a chance to change your statement that you didn't know Dr Craig. You'd save me some trouble, understand? At my age I don't want problems. Any statements to rectify? Very well. Heads decapitated, sarcophagus's, mummy's, voodoo rights, lying scientist, full east sun, I don't like this. There is more mystery in this world then all of us think. A criminal must be reasonable. - What? - But none of what is happening is. The motive, that is the question. I'm not used to thinking so much and I get tired. 25 years in this profession without a failure, I've never had to solve an important case. Now I can't make heads or tails of this damn case, worse yet I know something is going to happen, I can't stop it! - What must happen will happen, yes yes, we really don't do anything, the gods do it all. With our songs, rhythms and drawings we pray that the gods process us, we make with cornmeal the potions that have real power. Tonight we will sacrifice a young goose, the gods will come dancing because we can only believe in gods that dance. Need help Inspector? - I would need the help of all the gods. [tribal music] Would you please keep the camera focused on the sarcophagus? - Yes, sure. - Do it. Hey why is that still there? - Dr Kessling has the second part of his conferences tomorrow, looks like he doesn't want the mummy to get away. - You stay here and let me know if anything happens. - Like what? - You never know son, you never know. - Now listen, don't take your eyes off this sarcophagus, you understand? [intense music] - It is a virus 50 times smaller then any virus produced until now, it reproduces every three seconds. It's absolutely un-filterable. We have completed the Stratium 70 test and it can now produce blood poisoning in 30 seconds. - Thanks son. - Would you like to hear something absurd? - Love to. - This blood sample is a thousand years old. - A thousand? [intense music] - Inspector, Dr Kessling's helper is trying to open the sarcophagus. What, stop him? I'm afraid it's too late, he took the chain off. He said not to shoot, no matter what. - Shoot who? - Whatever or whoever comes out of the sarcophagus. - What can come out of a sarcophagus? - Seek Kenya. [intense music] [glass shatters] [water spatters] [intense music] [boxes crash] [door splnters] [tribal music] - It seems to me your silence has been very impudent Dr Kessling and let's hope that no one else gets hurt. No more victims. [tribal music] - Hello Inspctor. - Dominguez speaking here. - [Number Two] Number Two here. - Any news yet? - [Number Two] A truck just passed by here. - Good, don't stop it. - [Number Two] He pulled along the trees, the trucks slowing down, he stopped, he means getting off, he has a woman in his arms, she's fainted or dead. Inspector they're going into a cave. - Olyzon, it was used as burial grounds by the primitives. 300 years ago they found the sarcophagus in there. Do you know what that means? - That your protege returns home. - [Number Two] I follow them inside or wait? - Wait, we'll be there in a minute. - What are you going to do? - Whatever I can, just simply that. Your first mission? - Yes Sir? - When did you start? - I got the uniform in this morning. [mysterious music] - [Gatanebo] Don't be frightened. - Who are you? What do you want? - [Gatanebo] Nothing and all. - Are you Dr Craig? - [Gatanebo] No and you aren't who you think either. Maybe you don't remember. - What should I remember? - Once you and I were in love, we were happy. They separated us but I found you again, now we'll be together forever. - Forever? - [Gatanebo] Time doesn't count, it doesn't exist. Because it has no beginning or end. - [Sylvia] Dr Craig! - [Gatanebo] I'm not Dr Craig, nor you Sylvia. - You, go that way. You on that side, remember don't use your guns unless in self defense or when I order. Robert, you know how to use this? - Yes Sir. - Do you know what a mummy is my son? - No Sir. - At first you will think it's a human being like you or me but later you will realize it's not and that's when you will tremble. - Yes Sir. - But that is the time you will have to pull the trigger. Hurry, hurry! - You won't destroy it. - If I take it home my wife will get very angry. - But Inspector you can't do that. We have to keep it alive. - Don't make trouble, we've got quite enough of it right now and try to help us! Come on! - Don't be afraid, I would never harm you. [mysterious music] - Dr Craig, Dr Craig where are you?! I want to help you. - What is that idiot doing? He's going to spoil everything. - Dr Craig! Where are you?! Answer me! [intense music] - Get him, shoot him! [guns fire] He's here. [screams] [intense music] [romantic music] - [Gatanebo] History and life repeat themselves, repeat themselves. Within a thousand years, a thousand years. Gatanebo will search for Kenya, blood will run, terrible things will happen and everything will begin again. Begin again.
