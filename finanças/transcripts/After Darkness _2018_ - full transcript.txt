More than a dozen new dark spots on the surface of the sun. NASA's Joint Agency Satellite Division director, who has now made the data and observations available to the media, has confirmed the severity of this new data and what this means. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, has released new images of our sun, and the irregular solar activity has not only continued but seems to have intensified. This means we could be headed into a dark period. Governments across the world now admitting that these now coined "solar collapses" that have been recorded in the past months are literally shutting down our sun. The ecological and social impact already being felt around the world: global temperatures rapidly decreasing and unrest rapidly increasing. Many thinking to have... What scientists think is really happening is that most of the solar cycles have two curves, and not only one. What they think is going to happen is that solar activity will eventually increase and pick up again. What we have to fear most as of now is the unrest that is spreading across the world. It is important that we all try to remain calm and trust that there will be... I brought these in from the city. Thought it would make the house feel more comfortable. Gina. Your mouth. You're slipping again. Thank you. Don't make yourself too comfortable. It shouldn't be long. Shit. Fuck. Get in! Hi, Bean. Ray? What's gonna happen? What do you think is gonna happen? Dad said everything will be fine. That they're coming to get us, and they're going to take us to the caves. Where it's safe and warm. Clara? Mmm. It's so long. I like it. Yours is growing nicely. Well... Your room's all ready. You should clean up before you see him. Come. I'll be in in a minute. Hello. Yes, hello, this is, uh, Raymond Beaty calling for Senator-- Hello? Hello, can you hear me? Yes, it's Raymond Beaty, I'm calling for Senator Thorn. Yeah-- What? No, I can't hear you. Yeah. Yes. Yes, you said that to me yesterday. But um... All right, just leave a message, will you? Tell him that we're all ready here. We-- Yes. We're ready to go. Yes, it's Raymond Beaty again. Yes, he-- Hello? You like? Bean, I love. You know, you can't call me that. I'm not a kid anymore. I can see that. But you know, I don't think you need it. You're a natural beauty. Hey, look at me. Will we be all right? I don't know. Come here. There you go. Beautiful. Ray? I'm scared. It's okay. We all are. Even Dad? Yeah. Even Dad. Did you know that the sun's rays take eight minutes to reach here? Earth. I read that somewhere. You remind me so much of your mother sometimes. Have I told you that before? I need you, Raymond. I need you to grow up. If we're gonna survive this, your brother and I need you to be the man I know you can be. I think we need to think a little bit more realistically about what's going on here, Dad. About what's happening. About these caves. Find your mother. It's almost dinner time. Sorry. I made pot pie for dinner. You still like pot pie, don't you? Um... Darling? You needed something? Yeah, uh, Fred just showed up. He's here. He brought someone. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... Oh. She's been moving a lot lately. Oh, wow, so it's a girl? Do you have a name? Claudine. It was my grandmother's name. That's pretty. She kicked! I felt it. I felt it. Look at this table. We certainly have a lot to celebrate. It feels good to be back home again, doesn't it? You have a beautiful home, Mr. Beaty. Oh, well, you should see it in the fall. Quail season. Has it been in your family for a long time? No. I built this myself. You know, when I was young, the word "inheritance" wasn't a word that existed in my vocabulary. It's funny that now it seems to become ubiquitous in the vocabulary of modern youth. No, my father thought it was better to rely on dumb luck or faith, whatever you want to call it. He gambled away all the money he earned selling shoes to people who were better than him. Shoes to people who would walk more interesting paths than he ever dreamed of. Shoes people wore to work. Work. That's a word that seems to have disappeared. None for me, thank you. Oh, come on, a little bit won't hurt the baby. It's an '86. No one refuses an '86. Let's have a toast. To the Beatys, together again. And then some. Cheers. So, where did you two lovebirds meet? Oh. Um, Margot led this psychology lecture at the university that just blew everybody away. She blew me away. You should have seen it, there were so many guys after her, I practically had to fight them off. What? That's not true. It took months for you to talk to me. He would just follow me and then run away whenever I looked at him. Let me ask you a question. What do you intend to do about this? When the baby comes, and judging from your size, that will be relatively soon, when the baby comes, there will be no hospitals or doctors. So, how do you intend to have it? And once it's born, how do you intend to raise it in a world where only the strong survive, the weak perish? Have either of you thought for one minute... about the repercussions of your irresponsible behavior? It's really good to be home. When are they coming for us, Fred? I'm gonna prove to you that I can take care of you. I love you. Awake? Hmm. Up and at 'em, okay? Breakfast. We're gonna be okay. Your hair looks pretty. Okay. Is it gonna start getting cold? We have plenty of heat. We have plenty of warmth. Okay? I'm sorry. Breakfast is ready. Thank you. Is he going to stay up there all day again? I'll go check on him.Ah. How good of you to join us. What? You guys don't know what today is? What day is it? Well, my dear sister, today is the first day of spring. The flowers have bloomed, the birds are singing, and the sun is shining. He's barking again. Maybe he needs help. You've gotta eat something. You're gonna hurt the baby if you don't. Darling, please eat something. Fred, I found that old axe in the basement. Maybe you and I could go and chop some wood after breakfast. Yeah, that's fine--I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore. When are they coming for us? Please, for God's sake! Dad, I'm sorry--No, no. Fred, it's okay. It's all right. She's just worried about her survival. To be honest, I'd be concerned if she weren't. Do you pray at night, Margot? I've never been a man of faith myself. I'm a practical man. I think life is simple. If you live a life of integrity and responsibility, then you're rewarded. My conscious is clear. You can't do this anymore? Well, there's the door. And nobody's going to stop you and I'm sure God will go with you. They'll come for us when they come for us, and my family will wait as long as we have to. You're lying. Margot, please... Who do you think you are? - Just because you found your golden ticket, -What are you-- you think you can come into my house and call me a liar? You sit here, eat my food in my house. Who do you think you are? Clara, for God's sake, stop fidgeting! Gina. Too freakin' sunny in here. I can't be here one more second. We're safe here. It's freezing outside-- I want to go home! I want to call my family! I want to use the house phone! We're waiting for someone to come get us. When? You promised me we'd be safe. There's just other people they have to pick up first. We have to wait. We are just waiting for death. Hey. Hey, we are not just waiting for death, okay? We're waiting for her. When she comes, everything will be better. She's safe. There! Okay. Let's see. Go look. You know, you're pretty good at this. Abbey used to do it to me. She wore it all the time. I think that's why boys liked her so much. Who's Abbey? You can't go in there. Why not? We're not supposed to. I'll be right in.Okay. Clara did it. Isn't it nice? Fred. Hmm? Who's Abbey? She was my sister. She died five years ago. I'm so sorry. Why didn't you tell me? Let's not talk about this, okay? Can we spend all day together tomorrow? What's tomorrow? Mom. Hey, Mom. Yes? Can I dress up for my birthday? Yes. How are you? I'm fine. Darling. I know we don't really get to talk about Abbey. I'm sorry I couldn't be here. That was a really horrible day. Please. I'm fine. You've got to stop saying that you're fine. Not when it sounds like you're not. I don't want to talk about it. It's okay to talk about it. No, it's not okay to talk about it. Yes, it is. It's okay to talk about it. Haven't we all been through enough? Why do you insist on talking about it? Clara! Get off of that piano! Why? Because I said so! I'm fine. I'm fine. Mom? Are you mad at me? No. How could I be mad at my little baby? Oh. My darling little bunny. Oh, I've missed you. You mustn't go running off now. Mommy gets worried. Oh, you grew up so fast. Mom? You're hurting me. I'm tired. It's time for bed. Let me rest, Clara. Look, I don't know what the hold-up is here, but... I am running pretty low on patience so if you could just give me a time frame. I've got a house full of people here and... and... I practically got you your fucking nomination, you son of a bitch! You owe me, Bill. You promised me! Bill, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, um... Just-- Just give me a call, okay? Or just answer your phone. Will you do that, old friend? Okay? Okay. Hey. Is it time? No, no, no. It's tomorrow. Happy birthday. Good job. You want to go see something cool? Hmm? Hmm? Come on, let's go. We're gonna get in trouble. Dad doesn't like when we go outside at nighttime. It's always nighttime. What is it? I don't know. This is cool.Yeah. Happy birthday, Clara. Ray. Promise you won't leave. Clara... Just... Promise? I promise. Come on. Perfect. What do you think? Best cake ever. - Mom. - What? You're not too old for that, are you? Never too old for that.Yep. Good. I can't do it. There should be some candles in the drawers over there. Mom? Hmm? Yeah. You should go get dressed. Where's the birthday girl? Clara, we're waiting! Oh, that dog. Clara? You think this is funny? Mom said that I could dress up. What is it with you? I'm sorry--Off. Now. It still looks good. Thanks. It's time to cut the cake. Is he dead? - What? - The dog. You didn't kill him, did you? No, no, no. Where's that cake? My little girl's birthday. We can't yet. We're waiting for Ray. Oh, never mind him. Do you want to tell me what you two were doing outside last night? Don't fidget. Don't bother lying to me. Why were you outside? Clara, I thought I made myself perfectly clear. I don't want you going outside at nighttime. - It's always nighttime. -I don't want you going outside, period. Not at night, not during the day, not any time. Do you understand why I'm telling you this? Do you really? Because here we have warmth. We have food. We're safe. I am trying to take care of you. All of you! Why do you make it so goddamn hard? Don't cry. Look at me, Clara. Look at me. Don't cry. Do not cry. Do you understand? You understand why it's not safe to go outside? ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Clara ♪ Happy birthday to you Make a wish, Clara. I'm sorry. Sorry I haven't been there for you. You're going to be a dad. You have a girl that loves you. And you're happy. Aren't you? You know, I keep having this dream, over and over again, the same one. I'm holding her in my arms. Claudine. Hmm. She's the size of a bread crumb. So small. And I'm just so scared I'm going to drop her. And I do. I drop her. It's only a dream, Fred. We shouldn't be outside. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Uh, you didn't. It's just... It's usually just me up at this time. I couldn't sleep. I'm sorry. No, no, no. It's fine. What are you reading? I thought... just in case I never get to meet her, at least I would know what it would be like... to have her. It's silly. Why did you leave? I just couldn't deal anymore, you know? I couldn't... With everything that happened. I heard about your sister. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, that was a long time ago. Yeah. It's late. I'm gonna actually... try and get some sleep. What happened to her? Our father killed her. I love you, too. I miss you so much. Every night I go outside and I look up at the stars like we used to. I don't know if I can do this. It's... This is way worse than I remember. I can't. No, I can't. They're still my family. I need to be here for Clara. She needs me. I can't leave her again. This is not to be used... by anyone. Understood? At least you had the good sense not to bring her here with you. Well, nobody deserves to spend their last days here. You, my dear, are nothing! You're nothing! You do not exist! Do you understand me? You don't exist! She's here. Come on now, Gina. You better get a start on dinner. She's always been here. No. She hasn't. Abbey is dead. You know that. No. No. Don't fall apart on me now. We're almost there. Why didn't we help her? Why didn't we understand? She was just a child. You don't even care. You think I don't miss her? You think I don't think about her every single day? Then why didn't you let me go after her? Why did you stop me? Take your medicine. I don't want it. - Take your medicine! - No! No! Gina, take your medicine! It's all your fault! It's all your fault! No, it's your fault! It's your fault! You couldn't take care of her. Look at you! Look at you now. You can't even take care of yourself. I can't take care of our family without you. I cannot lose you again. This is the only way. You need them. Rest. Things will be better in the morning. You'll see. I'll make dinner tonight. I'm thinking risotto. Ah. See? Who is that? That's my sister. Sophie. She looks like you. You must miss your sister a lot. What happened to Abbey? I don't remember Abbey that much. Is that bad? Of course not. She used to get in trouble all the time. Dad would always yell at her and then everything would be fine. Not that day. What happened that day? That day... Mom found something of Abbey's. Something really bad. She ran away. They found her body by the shore. She ate a bunch of the bad berries. We've always known about the bad berries. Dad made sure we knew. What are the bad berries? They grow all around. A single one could kill you. Dad would always tell us. Dad said it was an accident. Ray said that she killed herself. Ray always told me the truth. Abbey! Abbey, you sweet girl! Oh, I'm so sorry! Mom! - Mrs. Beaty-- - I'm so sorry-- No! I'm so sorry. Fred! Fred! It's okay, Mom. It's me. No! No! Let go of me! - Mom! - Let go! Mom. It's okay. You'll be okay. No, no, no! Let go. No, please... Can you sit with her? Come, it's okay. No! I'm sorry. Sorry! Don't pretend you didn't hear that. You really shouldn't indulge her that way. It's the last thing she needs right now. What happened to you? What made you the heartless, horrible human being you are now, hmm? Whatever happens in the end, wherever you go, if you go to these caves, or you go to fucking hell, I'm not coming with you. Dinner's ready! Is she all right? Yeah, she's fine. She understands. She understands her mother's gone crazy? No, don't say that. That day... That day that you left... So proud of you. Telling your father what you wanted. What you needed. God knows I never... I never could. But you're stronger than him. Don't let him destroy you. Come on, Mom. Ray. I know. I know who you are. My little boy. So... So proud of my little boy. Come on, Mom. Let's get some rest, okay? Lay down. Gina? Georgina! It was my father's favorite. Dad, please. You've got to call them. Martin Beaty wasn't a lot of things. Well, he wasn't... he wasn't most things, actually, but he had great taste in music. Dad. He'll call, son. He will call. He has to. You know all I've done for the senator. Now come on, eat. Get some food in your stomach. We're going hunting after dinner. Hunting? Dad, it's too dark to hunt. There's not gonna be anything out there, it's too cold. - There'll be something. - What is wrong with you? For God's sake, call them! We can't live like this much longer! You will live however I want you to live, do you understand me? Margot, my dear, please, come. Come sit with us, please. Eat. Please sit. I'm afraid that Gina's not feeling too well. So, I apologize, but the risotto is a little dry and, um, we're out of red, sadly. You are all insane. I remember this part. - Foscari goes to visit his son in prison. - I'm leaving, Fred. Tonight. He tells him that although he loves him dearly, his duty must come first. Your mother isn't well, Fred. Somebody has to do something. She needs-- She needs what? Help? Medical attention? I'm afraid, my dear, she needs much more than that. She needs to talk to somebody. Well, you're the psychologist. Why not you? You tell her that everything is going to be okay. Tell her how to find inner peace and love. Tell her that the sun will come back up tomorrow, tell her she didn't kill her daughter. Do not tell me what my wife needs. I know what she needs. She needs to be taken away from here to someplace safe, someplace warm. She needs hope. She needs me. I'm going to get my gear. Meet me out front. Goodbye, Fred. Turn it off. Turn it off. Get down! Get out. Get out! Get out! Fred! Fred, open the door! Fred! No! Fred! Fred, please let me in. I just want to go home. What are you doing here? When I heard your voice, I knew I had to be with you. The stars, remember? It's getting bad out there. People in the streets, they're not acting normal. This is it. It's happening, Ray, I want to be with you. I come all this way to see you and all you can do is shrug? What do you want, Brian? I want to come with you to the caves. No. I'm not going to any caves. Then I want to spend my last few days with you, I don't care. We can't here. Then come away with me. Just you and me, like we always talked about. I can't leave Clara, you know that. I love you, Ray. I can't. I'm so sorry. Whoever is out there, whoever you are, get off my land or I'll shoot you! Please go. Please go. No, I won't! Do you hear me? No, I'm not leaving you. I won't go without you. Just go! Please leave! Just go! Just go. You're a coward. You hear me? Hello? Hello? Bill. I'm so glad you called. I knew you would call! I knew it, Bill! Uh... We're packed. We're ready to go. What? I don't understand. What-- What do you mean? What about the caves? Yes. What time is it? It's eight in the morning. What happened? You tell me. Ray said you had an accident. In your car. Where were you going? Well, we were running out of food... and I thought I could find some somewhere. The lights don't work anymore. Ray said he heard the phone ring. Who was it? Was it Bill? What did he say? They're coming for us. Tomorrow. It's over. It's gonna be cold. We should all stay together by the fire until they come tomorrow. Mom, we need you. Okay. It's time. It's time. What, here? Now? Yes. Everybody out! Everybody out! No, no, no. Fred, you stay. I need your help, come on.Okay. Let's go. Will she be all right? Yeah, she'll be fine. Daddy, are they really coming for us tomorrow? Mm-hmm. Yeah. How much stuff can I pack? As much as you want. I'm gonna go finish packing. So what are you gonna do? Just gonna kill us all? We are a bunch of cowards, aren't we? Is she coming? Do you think there'll be cute boys there? At the caves.Mmm. Mmm. There'll be lots of cute boys with that one. Good. Margot, push. She's coming. It's okay. Push. Oh, my God. I see the head. Margot, push! Okay. Okay. Wow. You're an aunt. I'm an aunt. That makes you an uncle. Okay, okay. Claudine. It's okay. Jesus. How's the baby? Healthy. That's good. That's good. Look at you. I remember the moment when I first saw you. You were so beautiful, perfect. I'd never seen anything so perfect. It was the first moment in my life that I felt... joy. Thank you, Gina. For choosing me. For everything. I'll go get dinner together. She's cold. It'll all be over tomorrow. We made it, Dad. It's over. Where did you go? Dad. What's going on? During different times, I would have rung the doorbell. What do you want? Oh, we aren't here to harm anyone. Enough harm's been done already, wouldn't you agree? We don't have much. What kind of a husband and a father would I be if I didn't provide for my family? Food's in the basement. No! That's mine! Clara, be quiet. - Daddy, it's for the caves. - I said be quiet! No, no. It's all right. Hey. You can tell me. Is your daddy taking you somewhere, princess? Yeah? Mm-hmm. Where's that? To the safe place. The caves. What caves? You got a way out? There's no room for you. Clara, just be quiet. What caves, you son of a bitch? Dad, just tell them about the caves. Dad. Tell them. There are no caves. There never were. Caves... Let's go. You have a very civilized household here. You should see some of the places we've visited, just animals. My car is in the garage. You could get in. Just go. Get away from here. Where is he? What did you do with him? He's dead. He was never gonna save you. He couldn't! Nobody can. It's over. Where are you going? I don't feel well. I know. I'm scared. Don't be. Will it hurt? I promise it won't. Do you think there's a heaven? I think so. I hope so. What do you think it's like? Well, I think it's pretty amazing. It's warm, but not too warm. And all your favorite food is there. And candy. Chocolate. Lots of chocolate. And there's water everywhere for you to swim in it. Water that cradles you from head to toe. You can dance... all day long if you want to. And there's no troubles or worries... just quiet. Peace. And all your favorite people are there. Abbey will be there. Oh, yes. Abbey will be there.
