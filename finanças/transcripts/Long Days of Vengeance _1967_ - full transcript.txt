The water is for horses. Forward. - Alarm! - Alarm! There's two! There's two! To the horses! It's the last time I ask you. Senor Cobb will be here any moment. And it's much better for you... ...that you deliver to me the negro slaves of his plantation! Listen to me, you pack of dogs! Here in Santo Sacramento things must go back to normal. Don't be getting any wrong ideas, because you'll all pay very dearly! And if there are any hotheads among you... ...we have the means to cool them forever! Do you understand me! What's going on at Santo Sacramento, señor Gomez? I'm sorry, señor Cobb, to have made you come all the way here. But these people need a lesson. Good. But don't mind, señor Gomez. We're glad for having come here. But we don't have much time. Proceed. So? You want to tell where you're hiding them! Put them all on one side of the square! - Go, quick! - Let's go, let's go! I'll just give you a minute! Decide! Get those two out! One minute... ...and I'll give the order to shoot! - With your permission, sir? - Come forward. Here here - It's close. - I get it, go, go. - It's very close. - Go, go. Walk! - Thank you very much. - What? Amigo, señor Cobb, he said muchas gracias. De nada senor, de nada. He said 'you're welcome'. Come on, move! Give them the gun belts! - What? - I don't know, friend. Come on, pick up your weapons! Pick them up! Take away those carcasses! Gomez. I didn't come here to Santo Sacramento just for those two bastards. Indeed, remember what I tell you. Matters of this kind you have to fix on your own. And if you're not capable, I'll send you back to the shop to cut beards and hair. Do you understand me? Yes, Senor Cobb. I never forget that I owe everything to you. But it's not easy, you know. I do my best. This is a cursed town. Enough. We come to Ted Barnett. Senor Cobb... ...you don't believe, that he may have crossed over? Maybe. But we must think that Barnett... ...certainly, didn't escape from prison... ...to run away across the border and leave with God. We must prepare to receive him. He'll show, I'm sure. So warn Sheriff Douglas too, in Kartown. I'm always in contact with Sheriff Douglas, don't worry. Listen, senor Cobb, if Barnett comes back to these parts... ...he has only one path, that of the canyons. Why, don't we send someone to meet him, to give him a welcome? And you'd have this someone? I've got my men, though, if you prefer to send your... I need mine here. And yours will know the place better. Yes, of course senor Cobb. - Show me these men. - Yes. Ramon! Manuel! Jesus! Emiliano! Anda! Anda! Anda! Anda! Anda! Anda! One time or other you'll break that animal's hocks. We have another fifteen in the stable. But what's with you today, you're nervous? Or is it's Barnett's escape what's bothering you? Sure it bothers me. - You could make a deal. - I will not make any deal. And see that you don't get mixed up. And Cobb? Cobb will agree with me. I intend to settle this matter once and for all. And in my own way. Well, Douglas, I have some advice... ...make it quick! I'll give you some advice too. Forget what Barnett was for you... ...because you wouldn't save yourself from him, nor from me. - Hello, Judge. - Hello. Have you heard the news? Never took so long here to know the bad news. You believe that Barnett will come by these parts. I don't believe that he escaped to get across the border and go to Mexico. We must prepare to receive him. Indeed, you should give me authorization to recruit new deputies. Agreed, but I recommend that everything is done within the law. Don't you worry, Judge Kincaid. And you too be on your guard. If you want to, I can give you a couple of backup men. I don't need protection. What do you mean? I say if Barnett returns to Kartown it will not be to thank you... ...Of those thirty years that you saddled on him. - Ah! - Cheers, Judge. I'm here, handsome. Unbuckle your gun belt. Take me to Gomez. May I know what Gomez is transmitting to you? He says they're waiting for the usual load... ...and that Cobb went to Santo Sacramento. And no news from Ted Barnett? - Who is it? - Ramon. Cheers. How's it going, Gomez? Come on. They put the telegraph in your house. The organization has improved. I interrupted a conversation between friends? You permit? Good news? Come on, please resume. Act as if I'm not here, really. Indeed, it's good that you warn Douglas that I've come to visit you. Come on, go on. What is it, Douglas? Ted Barnett. It's from Gomez. Shave and a haircut, Gomez. Shave and a haircut! You weren't a barber before doing Cobb and Douglas" shoe shining? You know I've been missing for three years. How do you wear your hair now, Gomez? I've always wanted to be fashionable, do you remember? I asked you a question, why don't you answer? Like all barbers, you were a big talker. What happened to you? Do you mind if we make a little conversation? You there, stay always well in sight. Tell me, Gomez, when they killed Colonel Steiger, you were there? Don't stop, Gomez, don't stop. - You were there? - No, I wasn't there. - SO, where were you? - Around. I would highly recommend, the low shade. Bravo. Bravo Gomez. So you were around who knows where. And who killed him, then? - They. It was them. - They? But who are they? You know very well. Many years have passed, Gomez... ...I don't remember. And then... ...and then, I sure would like, would very much like to... ...hear you say. Come on, they who? It was Douglas and Cobb's men. Really? well, well... You weren't there, you were around. Cobb and Douglas' men killed Steiger... But how come, then, you testified to Judge Kincaid... ...that I was the one who killed him? Careful, what the heck! Have you lost your touch, Gomez? - We were saying? - I was forced. They forced you? And with how much, Gomez? Let's do the shave. Let's do the shave! Where were we? How much they gave you. Well, not much perhaps, then. But once my father was eliminated, you took over the railroad... ...and you started doing good business. You make a lot of money. Take me through, Gomez. You started as a spy and false witness. Now what is your place in the organization? You're not doing just the telegraph. Who's looking after my father's railroad? I had nothing to do with the railroad. My skin is very delicate now, Gomez. But you always had excellent razors. That's it, bravo. You must sharpen it with love. What a pity, Gomez. YOU were a good barber. Do you know that in a big city in the east you would have done a fortune? I never liked being a barber. Mistake, because now it may be helpful if you knew to take advantage of it. What are you thinking, Gomez? Why don't you try? Just a little deeper. Come on, what's it going to take? It's just an instant. It's now or never, Gomez. And my father, who killed him? I don't know. Still! Still! Still! - Here you are, I saw it, this is it! - No, it's not that! But how, no? Come on, still! Still! Damn it! And don't you move! Like this! Still! Good. And the third that you owe him. And that's rotten? He's dead. NO one has ever muerto por un gouged out diente. You're a butcher. Who taught you this trade? Soy Doctor Pajarito, specialist in dentistry. - No, you're just a butcher. - And this? Did you pull out? No! Help! I'm Doctor Pajarito of the University of Philadelphia! Let me go! Stop that! If I catch you! - No, no! Let go of me, ignoramuses! - Cowards! - What do you need, stranger? - A healthy tooth puller. I'll blow your teeth out for you, every single one! Listen, my good man, the tooth puller, he's leaving. I'm leaving and so everything is okay. - And this guy? - He's so skinny. Let him go. He's not getting away with it. Murderer! Boo! Boo! You want to get off me? You weigh like a buffalo. You know, I've been missing for some time a mattress so comfortable. If you get out of here and go to Black River... ...You can find even more comfortable ones. There's a place where they rent a lot at night. And you're going to Black River, too? Yes, but I already got the mattress. - Which way do you go, Doctor? - Mine! Y tū? Are you coming with me, Doctor? But who are you? From dónde este jump out? Ugly thing ingratitude. I've been useful to you and you can be to me. I'm in a hurry, lousy swine. You want to tell, then, dónde vamos? Ah! To Kartown. From Mississippi to California... ...maybe there is no valley as beautiful as this. It was Mexico before you Yankees got here. It's mine now, just mine. As far as your gaze can reach, I am the state. Your predecessor, General, used to really like this game. Me and Menendez, though, we never got along too well. He often took part in it too. Because he found the prize to his taste. General Menendez was crazy for her. Come. Come on, come here. Go. Oh, lovely! Now I've taken him out, I've changed my mind on Menendez. Menendez and I were best friends. Menendez was a swine and did not serve the cause of the revolution. If the deceased general served or not the cause of the revolution... ...It makes no difference to me, friend. He never sowed trouble with me. He always paid me, punctually and in cash. Mister... ...YOU give me guns and I give you money. It's easy, no? One moment. - Well? - Nothing. Down in Santo Sacramento no one's seen Barnett. Gomez and another, they found them dead inside the house. - And the other three? - Disappeared. You saw Sheriff Douglas? Yes. I went to Kartown. He said the load is ready. - When he's sending? - Waiting for your orders. Mir Cobb! You said the girl goes to the winner? Paquito. Here! Right to you? Actually Menendez won her by beating my men. I already told you mister... ...that me and Menendez, we didn't think in the same manner. Citizens of Kartown, we stopped at esta fair city... ...porque uno de vuestros famous fellow citizens... ...has kindly requested us not to continue. Dallas, Dodge City and todas the greatest cities in the west... ...await the relief of our work... ...and the comfort of our remedies. But we, Doctor Pajarito, a graduate of the University of Philadelphia... ...and Dulcy the wild... ...daughter of an Indian and a Spanish nobleman... ...we wanted to pay tribute to Kartown City! Porque Ia nuestra stay will be short, we'll start right away. Many of you are in need of nuestra science... ...we have remedies and balms for todos the disorders that afflict la humanidad. Callos y durezas, dandruff and baldness! You, for instance, son. Yours es a desperate case. The only thing you can do, guapo, is pray to Dios. But maybe you already have! The great Lord and Almighty has heard you by sending me here to Kartown. This is for you. The only drawback is it's muy expensive. It's Chinese hair seed juice. - And how much does it cost? - How much for esto? Not even the riches of King Solomon would be enough to pay it! But I'm not a merchant, I trabajo only for the bien de Ia humanidad! It's a gift! Look here, Doctor. By chance, two years back, you didn't come by Fresno City? Fresno City? Never been to Fresno City! Sow and water, two times a day. And you only pay for the transport, ten dollars! Ten miserable dollars for a rare and precious remedy. Come on, don't hesitate! - Get down from there, you! - You want a bottle, too? - You come down and knock it off! - There's an order from Sheriff Douglas. We do not want stray dogs nor cheaters in Kartown. Mister, if you believe, I'll go and talk with Sheriff Douglas. Forget about it. You can't stay here. I have permission from the University of Philadelphia. - And who is this? - My niece Dulcy. - And what's she doing here? - She's staying with migo. - And what are you doing here? - Soy un doctor. I didn't ask who you are. I can clearly see that you're a charlatan. People like you are not welcome in our city. And if you stay here, close up shop or we'll make you run. What are you thinking? Because you wear that star you can bully? My uncle is a gentleman, who honors science! What's in here? - My cabinet. - A cabinet? Yes, my laboratory. It's full of muy I interesting things. Come, I'll show you. Give it a rest, charlatan. We're not interested in your laboratory. Try to clear out as soon as possible. And as long as you stay here, be careful not to screw over anyone. I've never been so offended in toda mi vida! Soy a doctor! Soy a graduate of the University of Philadelphia! I'm a scientist! With vuestra high-handedness, the spread of progress was hindered... ...in the city of Kartown. Yes, and rather get busy to catch that thug on the posters... ...Instead of bothering decent people! Get in! Drop the cannon, lousy swine! Tengo enough trouble on my own. I also needed a murderer between my feet! If I'm not welcome, I'll leave right away. Now you'll saying it, lousy! If you get out now that the whole town is watching us, we'll all end up hanging! You heard those with the star? They kicked me out! I got to shove off with the wagon! Don't worry, we'll leave as soon as possible. We're leaving? We're out of here! You can go wherever you want! - You've had more news? - No. But I say that if Barnett was at Gomez's two days ago... ...how, he can't be very far. Do you think he'll come to Kartown by train? No, I don't think. But there's no doubt now. Sooner or later he'll show up. Fifteen hours late! But this isn't a railroad, it's a track for the herds! Everyone asks, everyone decides! But am I a station master, me? Don't be mad, Mike. Do your job and shut up. - Greetings, Sheriff. - Everything all right? - All good. why? Something wrong? - Ted Barnett is out. - Barnett? Then there is trouble. - There will be trouble for him. Tell Cobb that, until we have regained Barnett, this is the last load. For contacts, now there is no longer Gomez... ...he'll think about finding a way. We will report back, Sheriff. Sure. And one more thing. You are Mr Cobb's men... ...and from now on you are responsible for the load, you hear? Stay sharp and smart. Rest assured, Sheriff. Nothing will happen. Good. But if you happen to encounter Ted Barnett, what do you do? What do you tell him? Maybe you tell him 'hands up, Ted?" You tell him that? But no! You must fill him with lead and that's it! Shoot him on sight, clear! Shut up, Mike! Are you crazy? You want to get me caught? I'm Ted, don't you remember? If I don't wear glasses, I don't hear a damn thing. You know I was convinced I'd never find you again? I can't understand anything if I don't see your lips. You're stil the same, son. Glad to see your back. Even if you're a murderer. Forget about it, Mike. Tell me, what do you know about my father's death? I only know that it was a Thursday... ...because that day the train from Tombstone-Santa Fe had passed. He's dead, Ted. They killed him. And since then everything changed. They do as they want. Who, Mike? Douglas and all his dirty band. There's a train out there and will leave when they say. I don't understand anything anymore. I'm the one starting to understand. But everything will change. You must help me. How? I'll have a lot to do here at the station and along the railroad. But you didn't see me and you won't see me. What is it? Why do you get up so early? - Don"t you hear a whistle? - Yes, I hear it. The train left last night. How can he be here now? And why is he whistling like that? You think Barnett had something to do with this? Go back to sleep and don't think about it. Be careful. Barnett's looking for you, you know. And if he's looking for you, too? Don't worry. There are more armed men in town than flies. What can he do? Did you warn the sheriff? The train's coming back! - I can see that too, but why? - You ask me? What do I know? Am I the station master? The trains come and go here and I don't understand anything anymore! I don't understand anything anymore! This is not a station! There's nobody on the locomotive! The train is coming back alone! There's nobody driving it! There's nobody driving it! Come back alone! - I woke you u - Ted! There is enchanting weather this morning and the night was cool too. How did you sleep? - My razor is gone. - Ted... Yes? I never thought I'd see you again. How can I explain everything to you in such a short time? But who told you that we're a little short on time? But Douglas could come back at any minute. Perhaps. I'll ask him where he put my razor. Ted... I am glad that you're here... ...really. They're still here! It's a good thing Douglas and I, we have completely different measurements. So he left my clothes untouched. So you're just like, as though these three years had not passed. What are three years? Three years of rest is good. - How you've been, Ted? - Fine, fine. Don't believe, you know, it was very difficult. For me too. In the beginning I defended you against everyone. But what could I do? The evidence was so overwhelming. Why do you say 'was'? Am I not anymore now? Even if you had not been, you can no longer prove it. Yes, but I could. With the help of one person. - Who? - You. - I don't know anything. - Sure. You don't know anything at all. And for you Douglas is the honored sheriff of Kartown. And the killing of my father, what do you know? I'll say it again, Ted, I don't know anything, not even about your father. You don't know one thing, though. Douglas helped me a lot. I was left alone, so I decided to marry him. But I'd still like to be on your side. But isn't it a little too soon to take my side? Wait, usually you choose the winning horse when he crosses the finish line. I don't need to wait. If you want to be on my side, you'll have to do things. Tell me what? I want to meet Douglas, alone, man-to-man. All right. We've pulled around a piece of work, niña. If word gets out that we brought him to Kartown... ...they're making us the feast. And with that train, have you seen what he's done? Lousy swine, esta noche we're leaving! - And the guns can't be found? - We've been searching. How did he unload the crates by himself? He forced Cobb's men of course, to unload them before killing everyone. We must gather all the people available and organize a beat. And what happens now with Cobb? He was supposed to deliver the load to the Mexicans tomorrow... ...we must warn him. - You want me to send one of the men? - The men don't know anything about guns. And it's not really the time. You could go alone. - But I need you here. - 507 So, now that Gomez isn't here anymore, we're immobilized. Cobb, of course will understand that we can't warn him. Now we've only one thing to do... ...catch Barnett! - Where's Douglas? - He's downstairs, by himself. Come on, let's go, let's not waste time. What are you writing, Douglas, your memoirs? Yes, and I've come to the most important episode... ...the night Ted Barnett got himself cooked like a chicken. You had a good cook. Barnett, put your hands up. Bravo. And now I'll tell something to you and you'll tell one to me. - Are we agreed? - All right. Who starts? I, but to ask... - Where did you put the guns? - In Pikowilde. I put them in Pikowilde, Douglas. Cobb and the Mexicans can go and get them there. But when I want. - Enough for you? - Yes, enough for me. And now it's my turn to ask. Yes, but make it quick, because now I have little time. It's true, Douglas... ...You have very little time. You counted the minutes. Your life is hanging by a thread... ...and you don't know. - Who killed my father? - Me. Me personally. It was a job... ...too delicate. So, Sheriff, how do you close your memoirs? Ted! I swear, I didn't know that he was the one who killed your father! No! No, Ted! Don't kill him! Hand him over to Judge Kincaid! I'll testify that he confessed to killing your father! What I asked you did, but I won't ask you anything else. One day, when I'll have time, I'll have to teach you good manners. You're still aqui you? What quieres? Don't shout. La niña is asleep. I want nothing to do with one who mata people. I saw how that train came back, what you did to those desgraciados. Well, they travelled without a ticket. What's going on? You want to wake up the whole town? - Hello, Dulcy. - To hell with you! I get the impression, Doctor, that you and your niece forget too quickly... ...the favors that are done to you. - I owe you a debt, I admit it. - Then pay. I thought I did, but you also want the interest. - Report him and let's grab the bounty. - Quiet you, lousy swine! What else do I have to do to pay your debt? Leave right away, follow the railway line. Sooner or later you'll find me, and then I'll tell you the rest too. But porqué, hombre, is there the rest too? Sure, sure there is. And it's also the most beautiful. But be careful when you reach me... ...YOU may not even find me in good health. Hey, murderer, who tienes aqui? A chicken. A chicken who wanted to eat me. Welcome, Barnett! - Who are you? - I'm Wilmar, don't you remember me? - Douglas's shadow! - You have a good memory. But, now, come on out of there with your hands up. We can discuss this thing, Wilmar! But tell me, what is it you want, me or the bounty? It's the same thing. For you, but not for me. It may even be that I don't get your hide! I want two things, catch the bounty... ...and demonstrate to Douglas that you're not so smart. I knew you"d come back here... ...and he wouldn't listen to me because he had another plan, he said. Barnett! My throat is dry by dint of talking. But if you want to... I don't trust that bastard. - Let's keep our eyes open - Yes, Boss. What's going on? The train's not slowing down! Get yourselves ready, muchachos. It's strange. What's he doing? They killed the engineer! Climb aboard and stop it! The wagon is empty, the crates are gone! There is nothing left here! Boss! It's Sheriff Douglas! Barnett! No entiendo! You want to tell me what this is all about? I don't like being made a fool, Mr Cobb! Someone took out the guns, and I think I know who did it! Chatter! It's business that doesn't concern me! I paid for those guns and I want them! General, I'm a man of my word in business. Just give me twelve hours, and I guarantee you'll have your guns here. I have the advance! Don't move from here. I will prove to you that you have no reason to doubt me. Let's go, come on! Greetings, friends. Who's in charge here? There is no leader here. Here there is a general. There he is. And you talk to him with respect. What do you want, gringo? - I wanted to talk to you about Cobb. - Go ahead, I'm listening. I can't do it now, because... ...because it intimidates me here. Pachito? Paquito intimidates you? Did you hear, muchachos. Paquito intimidates him! - I can tell him to go away? - For sure. Tell him to go away. I told him? Careful, gringo, you're getting into a lot of trouble. Let's talk about Cobb, amigo. He was not of his word, it turns out. He screwed you over. Maybe you gave him an advance and he didn't give you anything. I know you have a lot of money on those wagons and you want to shop. I sell guns. We can make a deal. Where are they? In a safe place, friend. If you want, I'll go get them. And how much do you want? Half the money you gave Cobb. It's a deal! I would've given nothing to Cobb... ...and I will give nothing to you. Put your hands up, imbecile! NO money, no guns. We will see about that, imbecile. Where are the guns? First the money. Where are the guns? Where are the guns? In Pikowilde. Vamos, muchachos! Dolly! Dolly! Dolly! The train arrived without the guns. Yes, I know. The guns are hidden in Pikowilde. Barnett was in here. He broke into the house and killed Douglas. Did he take anything? - Where did Douglas keep his papers? - It's useless, I'll never tell you. Let's go! Mr Cobb, have you heard the latest from Barnett? He killed five men and took the train away. I know. My men and I, we're hunting him. I hope you meet Sheriff Douglas, too. He's been missing since last night, he hasn't been seen. Maybe he's in hot pursuit of that thug. - Douglas is dead, he killed him. - Douglas is dead? And how do you know? I have no time now to explain to you, I must look for that damn wretch. Excuse me. But what he was looking for here in Douglas's office if he knew he died? I don't know, Judge. I saw him looking at some papers inside the cabinet. - Did he take anything? - Doesn't seem like. Nothing should be touched. I appoint you sheriff in place of Douglas. I'll do my best, Judge Kincaid. Bravo, Doctor. You're right on time. Murderer, you've found who tanned your hide? I told you maybe, you would not find me in good health. Just get me to the judge, Doctor. I'm in a hurry to talk with him. Have you lost la cabeza maybe, hombre? There"s a rich bounty on me, why throw it away? I'm not throwing nada away. You're the one who wants to throw your life away. Good morning, Judge. I was expecting you. I must speak to you. Stop, forget about it. Barnett is under my charge, he turned himself in. Come on, hand over the gun. All right, then. I'm off to Pikowilde. You get him to prison. Remember that only the law has the duty and the obligation to see justice done. I thought so, too, Judge, and I want to believe it again. But in certain cases it's better to go it alone. I hope that what I see will be enough to exonerate you. - Otherwise I'll have you hanged, Ted. - Think about it fast, Judge. Halt! The guns are no longer in Pikowilde. I saw the Mexicans taking them towards the frontier. They preceded us. We'll cut them off. we'll wait for them at the entrance of Rabbit Paso. Greetings, General! You've managed to get what you wanted. You've had better luck than me. Who told you that the guns were hidden in Pikowilde? An angel. An angel who wanted to act smart, but instead he was just an imbecile. Let's not waste any more time. Give me the rest of the money and keep the guns. Sure, sure, Mr Cobb! Why don't you come on down and get it? Judge, look over there! It seems to be a clash between two bands. Let's move in. Those in the gorge are a band of Mexicans. What are you doing here, Judge? I was headed to Pikowilde and I thought I'd find you there. But what I expected to see was something else. What do you mean? I was told that you were meeting with the Mexicans... ...to deliver them a load of guns. - And who gave you this information? - Ted Barnett. Barnett? And since when, Judge, do you listen to murderers? Barnett came to turn himself in voluntarily. Barnett is in your hands? - Yes. - Hang him, Judge! Maybe I will, but first I'd like to know... ...where the guns on those wagons come from and to whom they were going. I don't know anything, Judge, about guns. I was looking for Barnett and I encountered the Mexicans. They fired first and my men naturally returned fire. This is all what I know. Those crates I see them for the first time. - Goodbye, Judge. - Goodbye. What happened, Judge? Barnett, he tricked me. What was he hoping for? Have the gallows prepared. Tomorrow morning he'll pay for all his crimes. All right, Judge. Dirty whore! Whose side are you on, do you know? The guns were in Pikowilde... ...but there also had to be a charity ball on behalf of Judge Kincaid. Did you know that even the judge would come down there to enjoy the show? I didn't know anything. And where are Douglas' papers, you know that? - In his office. - It's not true! Whose side are you on, dirty whore! Mine! And now you listen to me good! Barnett will be hanged tomorrow! Tomorrow everything will be back to normal! And there will no longer be that doting Douglas by your side... ...to be your patron saint, So be careful about the game you play! You rat... You're out of luck, Barnett. What were you hoping I would find in Pikowilde? The truth. The truth you invented. And I who believed your words. Yet I warned you. And now you will pay. Your place is on the gallows and let me assure you that you'll go there very soon. Giudice Kincaid! Listen, Judge, I don't know what happened... ...but I understand you let Cobb play you for the second time. You wanted to play me and you failed. You murdered Sheriff Douglas just for revenge. Douglas was Cobb's man and Gomez too. They've been selling guns to Mexicans for years. They buy and sell slaves in all the Southern states and under your nose. Three years ago you convicted me of murder... ...believing the false evidence they had constructed. You're a fool, Judge Kincaid. Save your breath, Barnett. You'll need it in the morning. Since we have to hang you, we're also ready to satisfy your last wish. Do you have one? At ceremonies I always go in order... ...and tomorrow is very important to me. Can I go there like this? Go up. Fix the anchors. It needs a reinforcement under there. Put a stake on it. Hold the ladder for him. Pass me the rope. - You, Dolly? What happened? - I must speak to you, let me in. I brought you something that will interest you. Come. - And whiskey it is. - Pour me a lot. Drink up. The boss is outside, let's go. Let's go enjoy the show. Come. Have a pleasant journey, friend! You want one last sip? Thank you, I never drink early in the morning. Aqui esta. Perfecto, todo bien. Ya esta. - Puedo proceder, senor sheriff? - NO, one moment. Well, Sheriff! What's going on? Do you want to decide? May I know what the hell are we waiting for? Let's end this once and for all! Hangman, come on, pull that damn rope! Do your duty! I'm giving the orders, Mr Cobb! The law must be respected! That's why we're here! The law says he must be hanged, then let's hang him quickly! We're waiting for Judge Kincaid. Without him we cannot proceed. And go get him! The law cannot wait for convenience of anyone! He's coming! Ted Barnett... ...in the name of the law, I hereby declare you... ...free! Citizens of Kartown. I myself three years ago, sentenced Ted Barnett to thirty years. But now I know the evidence against him was false. I have received documents which previously I wasn't aware. From them it became very clear the responsibility of other persons... ...who, for thirst for money and dominion... ...had an interest in getting rid of the Barnett family. Mr Cobb, although the men at my disposal are inferior to yours... ...as of this moment, I hereby place you under arrest! Know that Sheriff Douglas' papers are in my hands. You just need to turn yourself over to the law. Let's go, come on! Behind, behind! Don't follow me, I don't have time for you now. - Sheriff, we came to give you a hand! - All right, place yourselves! Get him out of here! Did I or didn't I tell you not to follow me? You're the one that's always in my way! You insist. Don't help me! Woe betide if you sweat! Now that we have the mattress, we don't have the time... ...for sleep. Lousy! - Come on, I'll send you. - I'm the one who's leaving, braggart! Come on, outside! Doctor, what the hell are you doing? It's not like pulling teeth here, you know, lousy swine. 'Lousy swine', I say it, murderer! I lost sight of la niña, do you know anything? Looking for trouble, that one. And I'm sick of always being in the way... ...in the middle of trouble because of you and her! Lousy swine. Come on out, Barnett! Show yourself! Flush him out you lot! Surround him! Shoot! Shoot! Don't stop, you cowards! Out! Out! Behind! Behind! - Morgan, I got an idea. - Come on, spit it out. He never had any ideas in his life, he died thinking. Ted Barnett, you're lousy. Dammit, nothing I do comes out right. Now that I could rest, it's my turn to be a mattress.
