Are you happy, boss? Okay, so I think we're good to go and we're just gonna do a quick soundcheck. So you know, tell us about this village cinema. Oh aye, yeah, a cinema's gonna be great, yeah, gonna do it my way though, yeah, confiscate mobile phones on entry, how fucking annoying are they? Now no crisps, yeah, bagged goodies have to be opened beforehand, no noisy goodies, no slurping ice. Hey, we could bring back Guses, could we, remember them? I could do that, no talking, turn your phones off, it could be our motto that, couldn't it? Play it before the trailers. Sit down, shut up and watch the fucking film! Is this how I'll be sitting? Okay, we good? Right. Well, like most people, things annoyed me, living in a dump, seeing people do stuff, getting frustrated at stuff not happening. I don't know, I guess when I lost me old job, I got more frustrated seeing people signing on, not even looking for work and I don't know, I had more time to think about things. I was at the pub and I had a go at Mick, he owns like the local shop and his windows are boarded up, they look a right fucking mess, so I said get 'em done and he said, "There's no point in fixing 'em, "every time I do, all the kids smash 'em," because apparently it's a perfect place for 'em to hang out, get drunk and so on. I didn't believe him, I said just get 'em done, if they get broken again, I'll pay for 'em, so he did and barely a few weeks in, they got smashed and I made him a promise, no way would boards go up on them windows again. So every Friday and Saturday night I waited out there, every time a group of kids came, I said fuck off and they did, but then they come back, usually the same ones. I thought I can't do this forever, I need a different strategy, so I hid and waited, kids came like I knew they would, got settled, started drinking, getting lairier and lairier, they started graffitiing, abusing people walking passed and then started trying to break stuff, so I thought right, and I come out, they recognized me, "Ooh, it's him, have you come to tell us off?" I said fucking yes, stop banging the fucking windows. Anyway one of 'em come at me, so I pushed him away, nothing fucking harsh or anything, just keep him off. I was saying stuff like, you know, leave it, calm down, but they weren't listening and then we started all hitting each other. I held on to one of 'em till the coppers come and I was a fucking instant hero, but you know what? Six months on, Mick's windows are still intact and then after the article came out, the local Neighborhood Watch got in touch, wanted me to join, I thought I don't fucking think so. But then I started to think about it, what better way to show me newfound passion for making the community a better place? You're getting the fuck out, yes, you are, aren't you, ey? Yeah. - Yes, you are. - I know. Next time I come that isn't gonna be there, is it? Well, I think it's definitely an inspiration, I think people see someone like Pep standing up for what he believes in. Fuck! I think it's given everyone some much needed oomph really, you know, it's showed everyone that they don't just need to sit there and not get involved, they can actually do something about it. Hey, lively, in' he? - Is he a good guard dog? - Not really, he doesn't bark. It's no good licking the bad people, is it? Oh no, he's a good dog, hey, it's a good name as well, my son's called Billy. He's just right here at the bus stop with a film crew, with a sound man and a massive, furry mic. When me and my mates are playing, we're all like Pep's coming and then everyone legs it. Give 'em a wave, ey, get these lot! Are we on the telly? Dunno, maybe, is it? If we get good enough footage. Hey, don't worry about that. - He's dangerous. - Is he heck. What if he bites one of the kids? He won't, he's just running around, we come here all the time. Yeah, it only takes one moment and them dogs can snap. Now I'm asking you nicely put him on a lead. Clean up the streets and that, nobody else is doing it, so fair play to him. There should be more people like him. I left the pub on the piss like and got done over on the way home, pretty bad, face smashed in, big scar on the back of me head, see it, pretty big, in't it? - Yeah. - It's there. I can't hear what she's saying. That's 'cause she's talking to me, - we're trying to make plans. - Put her on loud speaker, - let's listen. - Yeah. - Hey, I'm not finished yet. - What are you doing, you dirty bastard? I think he would've preferred an on-the-spot fine. Show 'em your chin. Yeah, me chin, look, nice, big scar, makes me look like Harrison Ford. Not really, mate. Come on in. You know, I think he's become a bit of a local hero really and I think most people in the village would like to shake his hand and say thank you. Most people? Well, not everyone loves you, Pep. Get away, eh, show me the ones that don't like me. Cut that. Alright, Pep, the same? Yes, please, same as usual. Anything for you? Ey, oh, no, these are working. Same thing every day, finish work, come in here and pick a brew up, then go out and about. You're gonna be a little celebrity, - aren't you, Pep? - I already am. - Have you got a lid for that? - Sure. Smashing. - Lovely, and there you go. - Thank you. - Keep the change. - Oh, thanks. Come on. Now good news, we were successful in our application for a Lottery grant, so that's the village cinema paid for and there'll be a little left over. Can I have some new boots then? It's not for you, Pep, it's for the group. But I thought. But I do think it's a good opportunity to get a uniform, make us look more official around the town, any ideas? T-shirts. How about we get some high-vis jackets? High-vis jackets? I don't want to be highly visible, how the fuck do you expect me to creep up... Pep! Sorry. How do you expect me to creep up on someone with a high-visibility jacket on, ey? Can we claim my mileage now? No, if I can't have boots, you can't have mileage. I'm patrol leader round here and I ferry everyone around. Now everyone, I'm afraid I have some rather disturbing news, I've been informed there's a possibility that a convicted pedophile has been released and reintegrated into Hewson. You what? They could have been living here - for a number of months. - Who informed you? A friend on the police force. Well, he won't be reintegrating much longer, find out who it is. Will it be safe to walk the streets? I think you're a bit old for him, Patty, love. - What do we do? - We find out who he is. Look, if it's true, the police will have to tell us, then we bring him down. But we sorted this place, people feel safe here, let's not destroy that, we keep schtum till we know more. They don't help themselves, these people, you know, honest, they're stupid. I wanna show you I can go in their houses, steal stuff and they won't have a clue what's going on. Alright, mate. Come on. Can you hear me? Give me a wave if you can hear me. Right, get as much of this as you can. Promise you won't listen if I piss. - Hello, Mr.? - Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson, hello, I'm from the Gas Board and we've been detecting leaks in the area, so I'm just going round people's houses checking everything's okay, there's me ID, is it alright if I come in? - Yes, of course. - Smashing. - Ooh, nice picture. - Thank you, the meter's in there. Righto. It's in the cupboard. Over here? Smashing. Right. Well, looks alright to me. Do you mind if I have a browse? Not at all, not at all, would you like a cup of tea? Ooh, that'd be smashing, milk, no sugar. - Okay. - Wonderful. Here we go. Ooh! Have them. It's quite a nice house actually. - I'm off upstairs. - Excuse me? Pardon? - Did you say sugar? - No, ta. I fucking told him that. Bedroom number one. Ooh, hello, hello, hello, what the fuck's he doing with a corkscrew in his bedroom? I'll have that. You look like a right fucking pedo with that camera. - You dirty bastards. - It's ready! - Ey? - It's ready! Oh, yes, coming! Right, I'll see you in a bit, ey, I might bring you a biscuit. Coming! House keys, even locked him in for a joke. Wallet, about 50 quid in there, probably all he's got in the world. Corkscrew. You had no idea, you just let me in. You had a card. It were a Blockbuster Video card, you didn't even look. Do you know how easy you'd be? You need to be more alert. But it's so nice around here. No, it's not. There are dangerous people out there and you need to be more aware, yeah. Yes, yes. I'm only looking out for you. So what are you gonna do next time someone calls? Not answer my door. Look at her. She's hurting that thing inside her and she doesn't give a shit. Selfish bitch! How is that legal, eh? You know what, you just know that baby's gonna grow up just like her and theirs and the next. Fuck off! Do you know what? I think we should stop the fucking cycle now! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang, yes, yes, yes, yes and he's down! You cheated, you cheated, you cheated!! Hey, son, no one likes a bad loser. - You cheated! - Shut up. - Oh, come on. - Yes! It's the estate that's the problem, I mean, like most places I guess, But I know most people on that estate, they're good people. This one takes the biscuit. You can see why people don't bother, I sometimes wonder to myself why do I, when these twats can't help themselves. Can I help you? Did I say you could film my house? Oh, sorry, it's just we're making a documentary about the pig-like character trait of living in your own shit and we didn't think you'd mind. You what? Come on, you don't wanna live like this? You don't have to live like this. Look, I'll help, okay. There's no pride, people don't care and people on the outside look upon it with disgust, that bit of damp in the corner of the town that's spreading and all it needs is someone to come and sort it out, all we need is people to care, that's the main thing. Ey, it looks loads better, doesn't it? Hm. All right then, thanks anyway. Thanks, see you. See you. Just need a bit of pride. You need people on the street to sort out the filthy, robbing, fighting bastards that cause the crime. Look at that little lad there on his way home from school, his Mum thinks he's a little angel, but I know different, I see him after dark. It shouldn't be just down to me, but it is, 'cause no one else takes any action, I say your dog shits on the grass, you pick the shit up or I'll fucking feed it to you. Oh, he raped someone, but his Mum never bought him the latest Barcelona kit, so that fucking explains it. I'm sick of victims going unnoticed getting no help off anybody, fucking bystander apathy, walk on by, a bit of trouble and I'm gone, have you never been a victim of crime? 'Cause I have, ey, ey and if you haven't, you will be. Surely it's not that bad? Where have you been? Your Nancy questions, you come to a place like this and all you want is your fucking award, you middle class cunt! What have you been filming? I'm sick of it! And I'm sick of answering your questions. There's scum everywhere, girls won't walk home on their own in case they get raped, people won't even walk passed a gang of youths. People are that scared they have cameras and alarms and everything. Well, you know what I say? Fight fear with fear. If they hurt someone, I'll hurt them, if they rob someone, I'll break their bastard arms and if they rape someone, I'll chop off their fucking dick! See you, Dad. Batman wanted the best for Gotham City, he cleaned the streets of scum, they called him a superhero. Ah, oof, oof, oof! When you think about it, what's the difference between me and Batman, ey? Batman's fictional. Is he though? Hoo hoo! Ey, look at them, they'll do the trick. I don't like people spitting on the street, you know what I mean? He'd do more than I'd do, I'd sort of try and set up a website. - Because I read your phone? - What? I read your phone so I know you saw her today. What are you doing reading my phone anyway? That doesn't matter, why are you lying to me? Carry on, don't be shy. No? Oh, well, you might still be ruining my night, but at least everyone else is getting some peace. Can you leave us alone, please? We're trying to have a private conversation. Oh, we know, because we've heard every last fucking word. He showed us how effective and helpful we could really be. Hey! - Let me smell your breath. - What? You're not driving tonight, you've been drinking. I've honestly not been drinking. Stop fucking lying, now give me your keys. You're not taking her home, you're not taking yourself home, do you understand me? Ey, it's not safe. Somebody's got to and the people that should be in charge don't, they come when it's too late, 'cause they don't wanna fill a form in. Alright, girls, are we okay to leave? - Why? - What's the camera for? Are you making a film? Look, I'm from the Neighborhood Watch and we've had a call from one of the residents, who's feeling a little bit intimidated, 'cause you're here, so if you could leave. But we're not doing anything wrong. I'm afraid just being here's enough, alright. Are you making a film? Look, don't worry about them, worry about me. It's the sort of thing that people would look to the police for and they've just failed the village entirely. - Fuck off! - Hey! Get off, you fucking pedo! Shut up, don't shout stuff like that. You're a fucking pedo! Look what you've done now, she doesn't want you here, - so move! - No! I asked you to fucking move and you didn't, now look what you've done, everyone's looking, I'm feeling uncomfortable 'cause of you, so why don't you both stop being little bastards before you really fucking piss me off and fuck off! Come on. That's it, girls, on we go, cheerio, see ya! Them two nearly made me look a right tit. Cheeky bitch! I only did it for her. Look at that, ey. Have sex, great, yeah, have safe sex, brilliant, but how disgusting and disrespectful to throw that on the street floor, ey, animals! Do you want a bit? Woo! What's up with you? Woo! Woo! Oh, fucking hell. Are you ready? Yep. Are you scared? I get more scared than he does. We like our cinema nights, don't we? Do you like watching scary films, Billy? Love 'em. Turn that off, will you, you're ruining the atmosphere. Right, don't tell your Mum. I hope he's not dreaming of Freddy, ey. He's never watched one of these films, he's usually asleep after 10 minutes. I say he has though. Come on, son, let's get you to bed. Right, pass us that. Right, won't be a minute. ♪ Da da ♪ - Is that for me? - It's gotta be there. Yeah, alright. So he can welcome everyone coming round, ey? Yeah. Ey, just need a bit of pride. Who was that lad you were talking to? - From school. - What, off the team? Yeah. Hey, behave yourself. - Can I come in? - What do you want? Can I come in? Come on then. What? Are you gonna offer us a drink? No. What about the lads? Do you want a drink? No, thanks. What's that? Is it a mic? Come here. Hello. - Can you hear that? - Yeah. No, you can't. How about this? Do you want a cup of tea? No, thanks. What's she say then? Pep's a cock. What's she saying? Oh, what do you want, Pep? I'm busy. Busy? I'm sure. Did I say busy? Sorry, I meant bored. What do you want? I'm off to my Nan's soon. I thought she was dead. No, she's not, didn't you hear? What? - She were attacked. - What? I thought you knew everything. She were burgled, he pushed her over and she smashed her head on the floor. - Fucking hell. - Where were you, hero? See what I mean? Even with me, this place is a fucking shithole, thieves attacking old people and rumors of pedos. Pedo? Hey, it's not true, so don't go telling anyone. - I bet it's you. - What? How old was I when we first got together? Oh, shut up. Did he tell you how old I was? You were fucking old enough. Anyway that's not why I'm here. Well, why are you here? - Where were you last night? - What? Where were you? What's it to you? A lot when you're supposed to be looking after my kid. So I'm not allowed to do anything now, except raise the offspring of Pep? No, I said I'd have him all the time. Who was looking after him? No one, I leave him on his own. Just tell me, he's told me about Terry. This is what it's really about, in' it? Are you jealous, Pep? I couldn't give a shit, I just don't want some fucking random junkie you've picked up looking after Billy. Are you seeing him? Oh, what the fuck has it got to do with you? Yeah, I am and I fuck him every single night. Why do you talk like that, ey? So does he live here now then? Oh, so what if he does, Pep? - You don't even know him. - How do you know? You have no idea how long I've known him, I mean, I could've been seeing him when I was with you. Well, he can't know you very well, otherwise he wouldn't be with you. Oh, he knows me, Pep, he knows every inch of me. You're talking like a slag. Who the fuck are you to judge me? You go around and you beat people up and you think you have the right to sit here and fucking judge me? Yeah, and you've got a little kid and you behave the way you do, you're a disgrace. Fuck off, Pep! Why are you here, for Terry? You're a fucking thug! - I'm not a thug. - Oh, get out! All you lot, piss off an'all! Move! Sorry I'm late, guys, what have I missed? Adrian's just been telling us he's going to be in the newspaper tomorrow. Oh, aye, why? Find out you're the pedo? He stopped a robbery. Oh yeah, how? Just saw someone shoplift and pulled 'em up on it, they legged it, chased after 'em, dived on 'em and waited for the police to come. Sounds a bit dramatic. Well done, Adrian. I just thought what would Pep have done? I think we've all got a good idea. Nice one. You're right though, we need to be a bit more brave, do what's needed. We can't keep relying on you, Pep. Anyway moving on to the important news, the pedo, my copper says it isn't true. Now I don't know how convinced I am by that, but I say let's not take what we've created and leave it. Sal? I've no further information. Ady, you're the new hero, what do you think we should do? Well, I agree, I don't think we should scare anyone and would the police lie? I say let's leave it. Well, there we have it then, Ady says leave it. What? So the thief waited for the papers to arrive, did he? That's obviously some gimp they've got to pose. Ady, the fucking hero, ey? Good on him, didn't think he had it in him, still don't to be fair, but good on him. He can't do what I can do though, can he, eh, eh? He's not willing to do what needs to be done, I am. Signing on, drink problem, doesn't mind knocking his wife around, it's a textbook example of what we stand for, against whichever, fucking hell, he's off! He lives on that whole sort of adrenaline rush like sort of sprinters doing 10 seconds or Usain Bolt running, he gets that buzz from just going that bit further. You were too quick. Too quick? What do you want me to say? Hang on a minute, jog on the spot, 'cause we're making a film? I didn't get it, we needed it on camera. Ey? I think he's learned his lesson. I'm not saying that, it just won't work without it. Fuck! Yes, he's firm, but always fair. Alright, you selfish twats, do you wanna move over there? This is a non-smoking building. We're not in the building though, are we, so? Well, people have still got to walk through. Do them glasses not have lenses in? No. Pretentious twat! Well, that's alright, 'cause it makes it all a bit easier to poke your fucking eyes out! Now fuck off over there! It doesn't feel right anymore, it's like he's doing it more for him. Keep watching, I bet he drops it. I fucking knew it, make sure you get this. Oi! Oi! What's going on? They can't put it in the bin. Look at that, ey, good first throw stone that. Oi! Pick up the fucking can now! Fuck off. - Fucker! - Uh! He'll deal with things slightly differently to the way that the government would. There's a good lad, ey. It's amazing what a couple of stones to the head will do, ey, makes 'em think, he won't do that again, will he? Good to see you, Pep. And you, Nanna, how are you doing? You've brought your friends. What are you doing here? Nevermind that, look at that. - Ey, are you alright? - I'm alright. Come on, you letting us in or what? When I asked him what he was doing, he pushed me over and I hit my head on the floor. I was too scared to move, so I just lay there. But out of everything he took in the drawer over there, I have a little box of nice things that I like to look at, coins from holidays, all my favorite rings and he took the box. Don't worry, we'll get it all back for you. I just want my box, he wouldn't get any money for the things, they're cheap. He would for the TV and DVDs though. I just want the box. Did you recognize him? No, not really, but I don't see people, I don't walk around like I used to. I definitely won't walk around now, I'm too scared to go out of the house. It sounds like you're not safe in it. If you saw a picture of him, would you recognize him? Definitely, but it doesn't matter, Pep, I've already spoken to the police and they're doing everything they can, they've seen the video. The video? In the camera. They were up beforehand? Yes, I've been burgled before. - And it's on film? - Yes. And the police wouldn't do owt? Well, they said it's too blurry, they'd see what they could do. See what they could do? Right, you give me the tape, I promise you, Nanna, I'll get him. The old people in that close have been burgled that many times, they've got security cameras in their own homes. Disgusting. And it isn't the first time Bec's Nan has been done neither and we know who it is. A good idea. But these lot can't do owt about it. - There's not enough evidence. - Not enough evidence? - Look at it. - It's not clear enough. Well, it's enough evidence for me. - Doesn't it frustrate you? - Course it does. I don't know how you hold back. I don't know what's happened to this place, thieves, spongers, - pedos. - I never said that. - You didn't deny it. - Yes, I did. He wouldn't tell me anyway. We know who it is, but the police aren't interested, apparently video footage isn't enough for them. So they've given me permission to have a word and if that doesn't work, I'll have another word, then three, then four, until he can't utter any more words. Sounds exciting. It's Becky's grandmother, isn't it? So? - We want to send Ady. - No, this is mine. No, Pep, it's personal to you. Is it fuck! Pep. Look, if Becky got knocked over, I'd struggle for sympathy, Mrs. Randall means no more to me than she does to you lot. We don't want you to go, Pep, - because we don't trust you. - Oh, really? No one ever knows what you're doing. Are you questioning my methods? Yes, we are. The police have asked us to calm down a little. And you've lost control. I'm not doing anything different! We want Ady to go, I'm in charge of the rota and this situation needs his diplomacy. Diplomacy? Sal? Adrian's going, Pep, the way he dealt with those youths... Youths? Well, that's exactly the same, in'it? Ady, do you really think you can deal with this and get it sorted? Yeah, I really do. I've got footage of me sorting out real problems, not chatting to some kids or accidentally tripping up a shoplifter, you don't fool me, Ady. Yeah, footage of you hurting people. Fine, I'll do all the hard work again, I'll go see Mrs. Randall, check she's alright, 'cause I'm such a bad man, I'll get the tape, I'll have a word with the copper, I'll loosen the jar, Ady, you just make sure you can lift the lid off, ey? Are you alright with this, Adrian? - Yeah. - Can I come? - Yeah, that'd be great. - I'm coming. - No, Pep. - It's my case. - You'll undermine him. - No, I won't, I'll stay quiet and learn from his diplomacy. Adrian won't want you there. Ady, would you like me to come? That'd be great. Well, there we go then, all sorted. What the fuck do you want? Can we come in for a chat? No, you can't. Get out of the fucking way. Oi! What do you want? Look, we just wanna talk. - Pep. - What's with all this? Forget that, do you know why we're here? No, I don't. We've got footage of you robbing. Oh, give it to the police then. - Sit down. - Pep. You can't keep doing this, it's only a matter of time before you get caught again, the police are gonna come round soon, I just came to give you a warning. Incredible diplomacy. People like you are becoming extinct in Hewson, I suggest you have a bit of a rethink. Oh, I will do. - He's taking the piss, Ady. - I can handle it. Just can't keep your little dog quiet, can you? Oi, Pep! Sit down, Ady. You can't fucking do this. I can do what the fuck I like to scum like you, now sit the fuck down! You think you're the big, hard man, don't you, eh? Hitting old ladies, robbing hardworking people. What's prison like, ey? Like you don't know. No, I don't fucking know and you know why? - 'Cause I'm a good person. - Good person, what, bashing people about? I only hurt scum like you, so that makes me an even better person. Now I asked you what prison's like, is it that fucking great that you just can't wait to go back in, eh? Is it that good? Fucking answer me! The longer you ignore me, the worse it's gonna be for you. Well, it's not working, is it, ey, prison? You come out, you thieve, you go back in, you come out, you thieve, you go back in, repeat to fucking fade. Put your hands on the table. Show us your thieving hands and I'll go. Look at the dirty thieving hands. Uh! Argh! What if he didn't do it? He did it. How do you know? He did. And what if they're not her rings? - They are. - But what if they're not? Can you drive? Close your eyes, Nanna, I've got summat for you. There you go. Thank you, Pep. Billy! Go and play in your room, I just need to have a word with your Mum, alright. You alright? Billy said you're not feeling too good. I'm not. What's up? He's upset, said you've been sick all night. I was just a bit pissed. Do you think that's right? I'm not in the mood for this. I was just a bit pissed. Do you think it's good though, pregnant? Oh, why do you care? It's got nothing to do with you. Course I care about it and you. I hate the way we talk to each other. What do you want? Why do you think I always want summat? I don't know, why do you always want summat? I came to tell you I'd sorted that guy out, that did your Nan in. She won't be getting any more trouble - and if any of you get... - I get it, Pep. Is that all you wanted? No, you're not well, are you? I came to see if you're alright. Oh, you really are a hero. Yeah well, someone's gotta be, haven't they? Where is Terry, why's he not looking after you? And why's he letting you get pissed? I wouldn't let you get pissed. Oh, well. If we were still together. You wouldn't have to, I would've killed myself. Do you sometimes think it could've been different? What? Do you think it could've been different? - No, I don't. - Why? We had summat, that wasn't for nothing. What are you on about? Pep, I'm with Terry now, I'm starting a new family. Yeah, what are you on about? I wasn't saying that, I was saying things could've been different and they could have. As if I wanna be with you in your state. That's your problem, you know, someone's nice to you and you just think they wanna fuck you. Oh, fuck off, you prick! Who is Terry anyway? Who are these lot following? Me, 'cause I'm a man of action. Oh, right, if it's action you're after, you know, you should come round here later and see Terry. Oh, nice, I can see you're back to your glorious self. Oh, you know, come round here and watch Terry be a great Dad to Billy. Yeah, right. Do you know, Billy loves Terry. Does he fuck! Come on. It's got inside his head now that he's this hero. - Alright, that's enough. - Fuck off, you prick! Ey, have you seen him? He's about half your size, not exactly a fair fight, is it? Get out of my fucking face, dickhead. Or what, ey? You wanna carry on bashing him, do you, ey? Why don't you bash me, I'm about his size? He's a bit too enthusiastic, you know, it's like he's enjoying it. There's no two ways about it, course he enjoys it. - Fuck off! - Ey? Come on, come on, I'm in the mood now! You feel threatened, you feel like you can't just sit quietly without something kicking off. Ey, you fucker! It's just not village life, village life is supposed to be calm, friendly, you know, peaceful. ♪ Who's the bastard in the back ♪ What's going on, guys? It's near midnight and you're screaming? Shut up, you're waking people up. I don't like him, I think he's a prick. An absolute nob. Oi, boys! Give us one more before you go. ♪ England, England, England ♪ ♪ England, England ♪ Uh! He's just always looking for trouble, always looking for some reason to poke his nose in where he's not wanted. Hey, where are you going? - What's happened here? - It's done, Pep, - he's got the message. - Oh, right, you've done your damage, so you're gonna crawl back - to your cave, ey? - Oh, fuck off! Ey, don't tell me to fuck off. We don't need that sort of violence, that sort of threat in our village. Do you think you're hard with your fucking camera crew, ey? You're gonna hit me now, are you? Just mind your own business, Pep. Why, so you can go on hitting people with no comeback? - You prick! - You what? Are you gonna give me my comeback then, Pep, ey? Are you? Uh! What's going on? Why didn't anyone tell me there was a meeting? Hello, we're fine, Pep, you? Why didn't you tell me there was a meeting? You weren't at the last meeting, you clearly never check your emails and you know when we meet. Alright, what are we talking about? What have I missed? We were just talking about the fete. Fete, what fete? How come I don't know about the fete? You weren't at the last meeting. Where were you anyway, beating somebody up? Where was your apology? Shut up, you. Let's move on from the fete, shall we? No, no, no, hang on, what's this, like the one we had last year? - Exactly like that. - Well, there you go, - put my name down then. - Security? - What do you mean, security? - On the door? I'm not a fucking bouncer. Ey, I wanna be there hosting, the paper's will be there. I don't think that's a good idea, Pep, you're not exactly the face of the committee, are you? And Sarah is? Adrian's hosting. Is he? So I do all the hard work, get all the headlines? I seem to think it was Ady, who got the... Him? Who are these lads following me, eh? - Me. - I'm the publicity officer. How many fucking roles do you want? Why do I feel like I'm getting pushed out, ey, why? You're not being pushed out, Pep, I mean, you obviously do amazing work for us, but we just don't feel you set the right tone for a fete. I wanna be there. We've already voted, Pep, you're not coming. Right, and I'm assuming not informing me about these meetings means you don't want me here either? Not at all, we just need you to keep a low profile for a while, people are starting to. What? People are scared of you, Pep. Scared, fucking scared? Fair enough! Good luck with your fete. What do people think of me, ey? The bloke that solves people's problems or the bloke that batters people? I don't know what more I can do, people are scared of me, they won't talk to me. Oh, they'd clean me boots if I asked 'em, but that's not what I'm about, that's not respect, that's fear. Is this documentary not about me, ey? Do I not provide you with everything you need, ey? Do I not provide the village and the committee with everything they need? So why am I being pushed out, ey, what's changed? I don't get it, I've got rid of all the criminals, there is no crime, everyone is safe. They think I'm the most dangerous one left. Everyone needs someone to blame, a scapegoat, something to fear. Now that's me and they want rid. You get a cat to get rid of the rats, but when the rats are gone, you don't want the cat anymore, but what happens when you get rid of the cat? All the rats come flooding back. Here you go, Pep. - And here you go, love. - No, don't worry about it. No, don't be silly. No Pep, I don't want it. - How's your family? - Fine. And business? Fine, Pep. I want you to take me money. I don't want to. Alright, what's up? Can you turn the camera off, please? I know what this is about, you are fucking kidding. You wanted me to go. Camera off! You're not seriously gonna do this? Pep, we just wanna have a word, we have to. Come on. Alright. You've nothing to worry about. Have I, have I? Pep! - We're finished too now! - What? You haven't got an end for it. Yeah, we have, Pep! I told 'em about it, I can't keep silent anymore, we shouldn't keep silent anymore. We've all been worrying about spreading fear and keeping everyone happy, I was blinded. Why didn't the committee say anything, eh? We've known for a while now there's been a pedophile in Hewson, this quiet little paradise, but deep below the surface is this dirty, little secret. Well, people deserve to know, parents deserve to know, don't you think? We've been too worried about images and fetes and what people think, when all that really matters is the safety of this community and this is threatening it. Okay, everyone, Pep has some news. About what? The pedophile, he's here and we need to get him. I'm gonna do this with you or without you, but I thought we could do this together. - Is it really true? - Did he tell you who it was? No, he wouldn't, would he? He knows what we'd do, so what do you say? I think it's about time Hewson found out it's got a pedo sniffing after its kids. Everyone needs to know, I'll write a letter to every parent, maybe create a website, let people post pictures and tell us of any suspicious behavior. I'll do door to door. Police won't do owt, so we will. We need to start thinking of who it could be. This takes over everything else we do, we're gonna find out who this is. Don't they say it's usually someone single? Just finding out what they do in their spare time will be revealing. What do you like doing in your spare time, Paddy? I bet you like going on kiddie sites, don't you? - No. - It's not funny, Pep. Well, he certainly looks like one, don't you, Paddy? Do they like frequenting places where kids go regularly? They always have those eye, don't they? Right, someone with eyes, we're really narrowing it down, aren't we? I know what you mean, Adrian, makes you think how did they not know beforehand, seems so obvious afterwards. So is that picture of the kid there, is that like with the pedophile or is that the parent and it's crying after? It's the pedophile taking the child away and the child's crying and wants its mother. If that doesn't get your emotions going, what will? Do you believe in the death penalty? I do, yes, I do, yeah, for murder and pedophilia, yeah. - Are they the two? - Yeah. I was wondering why just boys, obviously you've got a daughter here and I just wondered why not girls as well? Well, it's girls, but boys rhymes with toys, that's the easy thing. So why's that like crying blood? Well, it's not blood, it's just that I was using the red and I just thought it'd be nice to put a tear in. If you've done something like this, there's no way you're gonna have changed. This is the sexual makeup of these people, they can't be cured and if there's a chance, that someone's gonna come in the village, then we need to do something to stop it. Do people change, do people alter their ways? Can we be safe anymore? And I think it's just got everybody to the state, where they're just really angry. He just wants running out of the village, doesn't he? I mean, we don't need it here, we don't want it here with our children, our children have got to be safe. So do you think it's definitely true then, the rumors are true, there definitely is a pedophile here? Oh yes, definitely, yeah. You don't think it's worth waiting for a little bit more evidence, more proof? Then it becomes too late. So can you tell us why you're demonstrating today? Yes, well, you've seen the headlines, there's a pedophile in Hewson. Yeah, but there's a question mark on that. Yeah, there is, but we can't take risks, can we? I mean, there's children out and about today, in't there? How people can let their children out, when there's a man like this on the loose, I don't know. My own personal view is anybody like that should be given to the victim's family and let them do what they want with him with no repercussions on them. I mean, in all honesty, do you think it's true? Oh yeah, yeah, it's gotta be, I mean, these stories don't just come out of nowhere, do they? You definitely don't just think this is just a bit of scaremongering? Well, I don't really know what that means, but yeah, yeah, I think that's right. What would you like to see happen to this guy? Hung. - Hung? - Hung. Anything else? Jailed as well, I suppose. These are all the people that fit the criteria, not been here long, non-family men, suspicious behavior, - visits... - What do you mean, suspicious behavior? Well, I know it sounds stupid, but you know, anyone who seems like maybe they could be. Look, you have to narrow it down somehow, don't you? So do you genuinely believe one of these could be a pedophile? Do you know what, I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Alright. Alright. That's me son? He's lovely. Lovely? Yeah. It's not a word I'd use to describe a boy. So why did you move here? I just wanted to live somewhere quieter. Yeah? Well, I've just beaten cancer, so I just wanted a calmer lifestyle. Single man moves to a quiet village? I'm sorry, what is this? What's this about you giving a kid some sweets? Excuse me? What are you giving kids sweets for? How obvious is that? I always carry sweets, I give everybody sweets. Yeah, I bet you do. Listen, I think you should leave. I don't understand what I've done wrong. Are you filming this? Have you heard of Sarah's Law? - I'm aware of it. - Good idea, in't it? - Don't you think? - What, I dunno. What do you mean you don't know? - Well... - So it's not a good idea for people to know there's a pedo living in their own town? - Suit you, would it? - No. What's that supposed to mean? So do you like kids? - What do you mean? - Just answer the question. Well, I don't have any and I don't want any, if that's what you mean. I'm sorry, who are you and what do you want? I'm from the Neighborhood Watch. And that gives you the right to do what? It gives me the right to watch you and I will be doing from now on. What are you doing in the park anyway? I like coming here to walk, I like the flowers, watching the kids play. Have you got any kids, any grandkids? No. So why do you like watching 'em, feeding 'em? I don't know. It just doesn't have pedophiles on there, anyone even accused. Ha, no smoke without fire, lad. And everyone tarred with the same brush. Well, you know a lot about it, don't you? - Not really. - Yeah, getting a bit defensive, aren't we, a bit tetchy? Summat to hide? You're the one who started talking about kids, maybe you've something to hide. Ah, fuck off! What gives you the right to come into my house, start filming and accusing me of that? Getting a bit aggressive, aren't we? That's it, come on, out now! - Ey, ey, ey! - Go on, clear off! Get out of my house now and you! No one wants you here, the mothers don't want you here and I don't want you here. So go up to him, oi, go up to him, yeah, ask him if he's got any sweets and that's it, yeah? - Now? - Yeah, now, go over by the swings and wait one minute and then go over, yeah? Go on. Just getting the dirty bastard on film. Every day on average there are 10 attacks on children, nearly a quarter of young adults experience sexual abuse. Fucking hell! Look at him. They're them Rs Ady was on about, fuck me. Alright. Here we go, identifying a pedophile. Understand that a pedophile will use a range of games, tricks, activities and language to gain trust and deceive a child, these include, here we go, sexually explicit games, fondling, kissing, touching, sexually suggestive behavior or exposing the child to pornographic material, bit of a giveaway, eh? Watch out for someone who is too charming, fucking rules Ady out, ey? But makes me number one suspect. Are you alright? Right, just go on up there a bit, under the light and just wait. Are you gonna stay with me? Yeah, don't worry about that, we're gonna be here, okay. - Yeah. - Go on then. What's he keep looking back for? So Billy's bait? What? Well, why does he keep looking over? Ey, how much do you charge? Listen, you stay here and stop looking over at us, we're gonna go back there and park up, okay, we're a bit too obvious here. Dad, I don't wanna do this. Look, it won't be for long. I'll see you in a bit, yeah. Yeah, okay. Good lad. Do you think there is a pedophile? Yeah, so I'm doing this to oust him once and for all, stand him up for all to see, make sure he moves as far away from Hewson as possible. To save the day? If you like, yeah, people think I'm bad or whatever, but all I ever wanted was to help this place and they turn on you. I can't let that stop me. People can think what they like of me, I'm gonna finish this, 'cause I don't want this dirty bastard pedo running around. You didn't used to think there was one, why do you now? 'Cause I was wrong, I wanted everything to appear perfect, but what's the use in feeling safe, ey, we need to be safe. I'd love to be wrong, I'd love it to just be a rumor and for us all to go back being safe, I'd love not to be needed, but I am, so we can't stop, 'cause I don't wanna live in a place, where no one trusts each other or we're too scared for our kids, too scared for Billy. I have to get him, I have no choice. They said 100% there isn't a convicted pedophile in Hewson, how I read it is that someone was accused and then all the allegations dropped. Why? I don't know, but they moved here to get away from the rumors. Yeah, I bet they did. Well, let's fire them back up and keep 'em moving on. Look, I've just pieced together all these fragments of information. - No names? - No. Well, what about the checks? They're not gonna happen, Pep, we can only ask for checks, if they're directly linked with children, which none of them are, their partners or friends with children can request the checks, but not us. Oh, so that's it, not a yes or a no or a nod or a wink? Unfortunately not, but someone moved here recently, who was a youth worker before they came and now they're not. - Now why not? - Good question, and guess who that person is. What? What do you think you're doing? - I wanna talk. - No, you don't, you want to bully me, I'm not interested, so leave. Ey, I came round here to talk, ask a few questions, - that's all. - Like the last time? You don't even know me and you talk to me the way you do. Why are you being like this? You're not right in the head, they said that you were a bit loopy, but this? - Ey! - Look, I don't like the way this is going and I don't fucking like that camera being pointed at me, I don't really like you either. Now I've nothing more to say, you're not coming in. I came round here to be nice, give you a chance to talk, clear a few things up for once, don't back yourself into a corner. See you, bye. Ey, I hope you know what you're living next door to. Oi, don't you dare! Don't you dare do that to my neighbor. I don't care what goes on in that sick, twisted little mind of yours, right, but don't you dare drag any of those into it. Why are you getting so worked up? I mean, if there was nothing wrong, you wouldn't be getting het up, would you? Camera never lies. - What's going on? - Him! He weren't very friendly, was he? Alright, Billy said you wanted a word. Why did you make Billy walk the streets on his own with you miles away when you know there's a pedo? I mean, Billy may be seven, but I'm not, you're a fucking disgrace, Pep, that is your son! Ey, I'm doing it for him, I'm doing it for Billy, I was there with him, you've got it wrong. No, you've got it wrong in your head, in your stupid head! You know, Billy is shit scared of this pedo and he told me you've been telling him stories about what they do. Yeah, he's gotta know to be careful. No, he doesn't need to know any of it, Pep, he needs you to look after him. You know, he's seven fucking years old, he's gonna have a life of shit, don't start him young. Look, I'm gonna get him for Billy and for, you know, it's not like that, I promise. We're going, Pep. What do you mean? I fucking hate this place. But I've cleaned it up, it's a fucking paradise. I hate it and now there's a dirty, fucking pedophile here, how am I meant to bring up two kids, you know, who couldn't sleep, they wouldn't live normal lives. Look, it won't just be you, will it? I'll be here. Oh, what a fucking role model, you are. You don't need to go, Becs, I'll get him, I promise. Look at him, I mean, what the fuck does he think he's doing? He thinks he's Billy Big Shot running around with that camera. Bunch of twats. - Accusing me. - He told me, you know. Oh, yeah, moved to Hewson to fuck a few of their inbred kids, who wouldn't want that? Coppers have had words with him. - I heard. - He's probably the pedophile. He looks like one, doesn't he? I can't relax with him just being here. I know, he's a nutter. Look at him, what do you reckon he's listening to? Probably himself beating someone up. He's always in here shouting his mouth off. No one will sit with him, look, he's an animal. I wish someone would give him a slap. Terry says they're moving, shedding contact with him. What are you banging on about? - Do you fancy her? - Fuck off. Get the beers in and give that twat a slap, will you? Go on then, give us a slap! He's talking to us. Go on then, give us a slap. - What's up, Pep? - Ey? Come on! Come on! - Are you alright, Pep? - Yeah, I'm alright. Gonna give us a slap, are you? What? They all know, you know. Now why don't you fuck off, before I really lose me rag? Come on. It's fun, in'it? Aye, aye, what have we got here? Thought I'd bring you a nice cup of fucking tea! Prick. Ey! You haven't got a biscuit to go with that, have you? Yeah? Billy? - Are you alright, mate? - I'm scared. - Can I come in? - Yeah. - How are you doing? - Fine, just a little bit tired. Mum said you've been a bit scared lately? Sort of. About me talking about the pedophile? Yeah. - Do you know what one is? - No. It's a bit like a bogeyman. Billy, all I need you to know is you need to be safe and know I'll be here to look after you. Yeah. Look, I know, I know we've made you do scary things, I'm just trying to make it safe for you. Hm-mm. I don't want it to be so scary for you, that you're forced to leave, I want you here with me. I don't want to go either, Dad. I'm sorry if I scared you, if I've been scaring you, I just wanted to chase away the bogeyman. I love you, mate. I love you too, Dad. I never felt so helpless. Have you ever been in a situation, where you just don't know what to do, like there's no actual way out of it? What can I do, ey? How come there's never a debate, ey? The woman wants to fuck off with the kids and that's it, well, why should it be? Why is it a given? Motherly love, ey? Have you seen her? I love him, I'm better for him than she is and he'd prefer to stay with me, but oh no, she's a mother, I can see why those blokes dress up as Batman and demand more rights. Who the fuck is Terry anyway, eh? Comes along, plays his little fucking ditty and everyone follows him off into the sunset. Why do they want to leave, ey? I can't let them leave, they can't leave, not with Billy anyway and she's having a baby, why does she want to move to the city, ey? It needs to be raised somewhere safe, somewhere like Hewson and know it'll be kept safe by me. So this guy here has been threatening kids with a baseball bat, 'cause they broke his window, what's that all about, ey, a fucking baseball bat? Yeah well, let's go see what he's got to say for himself, ey, see if he threatens me with a fucking baseball bat. - I've been looking for you. - You've been looking for me? I've gone to the police about you. Me, what have I done? You're the one whose been threatening... Why are you going around telling everyone - I'm a fucking pedophile? - Me, I haven't said a word. Well, it's no one else, look what the kids have done, - they're down here hassling me. - Yeah, that's why I'm here, what's this about you going threatening kids with baseball bats, eh? What else am I supposed to do? They're down here every night throwing stuff at my house, people are looking at me funny on the street, I can see it! Pep, I'm not stupid, I know it's you, will you stop, stop with the fucking rumors? Yeah, what, why, ey? You can't go round threatening kids with baseball bats! Fuck you! - Why is it, ey? - You fucking... - Did they turn you down? - Fucking get back! Setting people on fire, are you, ey? You're fucking mad! It isn't like I've threatened you with a fucking baseball bat, ey! I think we've got him. Where is she? - Did you text her? - Yeah. Come on. Billy! What? Come on, mate, help us clean this place up for your Mum, ey. Alright. Stick your bag up there with your gun. Want one? Get them, put 'em there. Have you ever cleaned up before? Where are they? - There. - I'll just do this one. Do you want the gloves? Alright, stick it in there. Ey, you've made a mess. Bill, get your stuff, your Mum's having the baby, we tried calling you. Pep, I guess? Terry? Sorry to burst in and rush off like this. No worries. Thanks for waiting with him. Is this gonna be your first kid then? Good, okay. Right, we're gonna. Don't worry, I've got a key. Great, see you then. - See you, Dad. - Come on. Turn it off. Hiya, how was it, are you alright? Knackered? Yeah. Where shall I put these? Wherever. Billy with Terry? Yeah, Billy got a bit excited and I needed a bit of peace. And I ruined it all, eh? Yeah, you did. Weird, in'it? What? Dunno, you, a Mum again. I know, how'd it happen, ey? Pissed that night too? Ey up, he's alive at least. Come say hello, Pep. He looks just like Billy did. Don't go. Right, I'm gonna find out once and for all. I'm going in, I'm gonna raid his computer, his drawers, his whole fucking house if necessary, I'm gonna get all the evidence we need. Right, now I'm round the back, fucking hell, it's dark here. Can't feel me own arse, it's that dark. Okay, I don't think any of the windows are open, so how the fuck do I get in, ey? I've got no choice, have I? Here goes. Fuck's sake! Oh no. Oh, he's left the fucking light on. What should we do? Darren, Darren! Hello? - Is that him? - Yes, obviously. I can hear him outside. Fucking hell! I told you to fucking warn me. How could I warn you, you fucking dickhead? Do something, knock on the door or summat. What should we do? What the fuck are you doing in my house? - Put the bat down. - Fucking hell. Get out! Put the fucking bat down now. - Get out of my house! - Back off. Pep, what the fuck are you doing here? Fuck it, let's just go. - One more time. - Let's just fucking do it. I'm telling you get out of my house now! We've got to fucking go, come on! - Put it down. - Get the fuck out! Move that fucking bat away from me! - Get the fuck out! - You don't fucking want this. - Get out of my house now! - Back off, back off! Give it the fucking nod. - Get out of my house! - Back off! - Get the fuck out! - Put the fucking bat down! Get the fuck out of my house! - Pep! - Fuck off! - Pep! - I'm fucking warning you! Get out of my house! Put that fucking bat down! Fuck off! Uh, you fucker! Uh! Uh!
