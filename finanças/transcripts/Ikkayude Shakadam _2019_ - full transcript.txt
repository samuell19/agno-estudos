I'm going to say it more times. If you say once more, I'll smash your face. You brought up a police man in to the court today. Police man! Say suspended police man. You... I got suspension because of this case filed by you. Then you may also file a case against for this. (No audio) If it happened in home, it will call as a family conflict. And if it happening in society it will call as revolution. Eh? If it is Cuba or family, blood will drop down if revolution happened... There should drop down the blood. So you must decide yourself what to do. Why are they looking at me? Worse dialouge it was? Eh? Ikka... Help me to perform well. There is not only this kind of relationship between male and female. Men who are confident and self-respecting will never abuse or oppress women. You ladies will guess what others dont think. You will love by cursing... and will cry by hiding laugh, will also hate them by wanting them. God gave you a blessing that you can love more than one guy at a time... and you got the ability to replace each of them in your context. In this world ladies are happy every time. Men will tensed every time and seeking liquor for getting a relief. So, forget everything, and orgive each other's faults and live well. Bro... Bro... Bro... Eh?

So that, I'm not going anywhere! Ayyappan, you just leave before she wake up. Otherwise she won't allow you to go. Ok. Sir, shall we go? Sir, are you a newcomer here? How did you know that? If anybody came to Cochin, they will speak Cochin slang in a month. Why are you using this cab? Were you in Kolkata? This is first time in my life who speaks about this car.

Hey, is there any star value in this movie? We won't get atleast satellite rate for this movie. I wandered many looking for a star. They are very busy. Even no time to listen a script. It's an expriemental movie script. So they are not willing to take any risk. Dear, listen me... See, many experiemental movies released in the last year. Only one or two movies made commercial success. The rest of the movies have made losses to it's producers. I think, only Ikka or Fahad Ikka will have take this kind of risks. Every others will do movies in the safest way. And you know, there are too many super stars here and the fans treated them as Gods. But these fans really don't know about their friendship. Anyway, this story is about a hardcore fan of Mamootty... So it is about a fan who is mad at worship, right? Sir... Mammookka is an inspiration for us to win the battle. And not making any actor to be mad acting. This won't work, man. Shall I tell you another story? Damn! I don't need any experiemental one. Put some superb story. For a common person, his dreams are all experiements. Yes, yes... get started... [Displaying Mammootty movies] Didnt' get up yet? - What's the time? - 10 O' clock! Open the eyes.
