You were cute! [Laughter] Oh, look. You guys were cute. And that was the last time Jenny and I wore the same size swimsuit. Mom...those movies? It was Ellen's idea. 8th birthday, remember? Ohh... Check it out. Sit down. Oh, I cannot watch this. Nice wig. Look at that curtain. [Laughter] Look how young you are, Jean. Ellen. What? Is this a party or what? Come on. Ew, you're wet. Steve, you and Carla take it outside. You're dripping all over my furniture. Out! Out! Out! Hey, let's go. Wait up. Alright. Last one in... Come on in, Carla. Come on, Carla, get into the water! [Coughing] Oh. Hey, mom, did you see how the guys treated Ellen? I felt so bad. She feels a little left out. She is your best friend. You should spend more time with her. Yeah, but she's got Celeste. We're going in different directions. Listen, girlfriend, when she got pregnant, she made a tough decision. I'm proud of the way she's raising Celeste. Look at that baby. You're a big girl. I love you. Watch her. Hey! Ellen dump Celeste on you again, mom? Adam, will you use a little more tact? No offense, Celeste. Oh... Steve. Will you talk to my mom? She won't listen to me. Well, what's the problem, Kathy? Everything! The boys I go out with... My grades... It's like we don't speak the same language. I went through the same thing with my parents. But you're not like that. You're like one of US. I'll call her tomorrow. But it works both ways. You have to listen to her, too. Get out of here. Stop... Hey. I'm hungry. I thought if we just had a day together... Just you and me. Like the old days, huh? Guess what. Bob called. You're kidding. What for? How should I know? He talked about himself as usual. He didn't even ask about Celeste. You're lucky you didn't marry him. He never asked. And Dan's been bitching I'm still too fat. And I've got apple cheeks. So what? Right? Right. Ohh. Aw... There. Nothing about apple cheeks or being overweight. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Come on, let's go. Come on. Ooh! Oh, man. She's hot. Ooh, babe. What? Swear to god, girl. Someday you're going to get jumped. I'm just having fun. Fun doesn't mean going after Dan, does it? Now, why would you say something like that? Ellen? You used to go out with him. It's been over between me and Dan before you started going out with him. I know. Just look at you, and look at me. I mean, I got a kid and... You have everything. Everybody loves you. You've got the perfect mom. I wish I could trade lives with you. Ellen, that's not true. I mean, you're smart, you're passionate. You're my best friend. I love you. I love you, too, Jen. No way. Diane, we didn't steal anything. I'm walking around with some stuff. Jenny goes outside to talk to some guy. She's got the money. I don't have any. So I go to get her, and they nailed US! Is that what happened, Jenny? Yeah. Did the store clerk know about this? Of course! But he's not going to believe US! Well, I don't know. They told me something different. I'm sorry I can't stay with you, but I'm late for work. There's chicken in the fridge. Bye. Bye. Bye. If my mother ever finds out... So don't tell her. Diane won't. She believes anything I say. Hello, ladies. Hi, Charlie. Diane and Joe think since I'm adopted, anything I do wrong is not their genetics. And I am going to get you that bikini. Forget it. You're not going back there. No problem. I'll get Carla to do it. Want some? Where'd you get this? I bought it. $65... How'd you buy it? I've been saving up. Saving what? Birthday money. Allowance. How'd you pay for it, Jenny? I told you. You think I'm lying? Are you looking for these? Yeah. You left them at the police station. But you won't be needing them because you're grounded forever. What for? I didn't steal anything. It was Ellen, and then she made Carla go back for it. You expect me to believe that? Yes! It's the truth. My parents kept me on a very short leash. I know, mom. I swore I'd be different with my daughter. I let you do what you want. I treat you like an adult-- with respect. It's a two-way street. You have to respect me, too, and not lie to me. Like you've never lied to me? About the divorce? Daddy's girlfriend? Why didn't you tell me that? I was trying to protect you. Protect me? Was it better that I walked in on them? Don't change the subject. I have to tell you everything, but you only tell me what you want to. It's not fair! You were arrested for shoplifting. You should've told me. I don't care that you made a mistake. Everybody makes mistakes. But I care about you being honest with me and not being a coward! [Rings doorbell] Hi. You can't come in. I'm grounded. Jean doesn't mean me. I mean you. I don't know why I listen to you. I knew what you did was wrong, and I just caved in. It's not my fault you got caught. It's your fault you and Carla stole it. I know my part. Then take your part. I have. You have not. Grow up, Ellen. I accepted my responsibility, and I'm grounded. And you can't come in. End of story. Mmm. Mmm. Mom this is not the most scientific way to treat a fused vertebrae. Oh, it always feel so much better when you do it. A couple more months, I should be off disability. I never thought I'd be glad to go back to bookkeeping. Ohh... Mom... I'm sorry. The things I said. It's okay, Jen. I have a confession to make. I overheard what you told Ellen today. I'm very proud of you for recognizing the wrong in what you did. It's very mature. Does that mean I'm not grounded forever? Come on. Come on. Make it a week. Yes! Rub! Oh, sorry. I know you're very angry at Ellen, and you should be, but don't lose sight of the fact that you two have been friends a long time. And part of growing up is learning to forgive. Yeah. I just couldn't live with Diane and Joe anymore. They were always on my case. But here it's great. We party all the time. Nobody says, "turn that damn music down!" Plus... Having your man beside you in bed every night. That's not what I heard. What? What did you hear? Just rumors... But I'm worried. What's going on with you and Dan? Nothing. We argue, but every couple argues. He's not working. It's cool. We've got food stamps, and I went to welfare. Hey, what is this? I've missed you, Jen. This is the first time you're in my new house. Celeste, if you don't stop squirming, I'm going to smack your bottom. Okay. Will you get her bottle for me? It's in the kitchen. Yeah. [Loud music playing] Hi, baby. Let me up, Dan. When are we getting back together? You know I don't love Ellen. What the hell are you doing? Get away from me! How could you betray me like that? I didn't do anything! Liar! Get out. Get out! [Band plays when the saints go marching in] Jean, I'm not even pregnant yet. I only asked when you and Greg are going to make me a grandmother. Mother, most women aren't anxious to be known as "granny." Come on, honey. You and Ellen will work it out. Don't let it spoil the last day of summer. I hate labor day. Means back to school. The older you get, the shorter the summers. Tell me about it. Senior year is going to be great. With the prom, picking a college, your whole future will be in front of you. When you say it like that, it sounds cool. It is cool. Hey, Mrs. M. Hi, Steve. Mind if I... Borrow your daughter? So where's Carla? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. We broke up. Hey, Jenny! Turner, you jerk! Yee-haw! Crazy idiot's going to kill somebody. You okay? Yeah...yeah. So, what happened with Carla? Too jealous. She tried to set me up with one of her girlfriends and then busted me for cheating. I'm sorry. Well, now maybe... You and me can get back together. Steve, Carla's my friend. Jen, I'm not with her anymore, and besides, I know you still like me. Is that right? Yeah. Look, let me talk to Carla first. Why? Don't you trust me? Because it's the right thing to do. Don't be mad, okay? [Firecrackers explode] Aah! Aah! Aah! Let's go. [Laughing] Help! Mom! Mom! What happened? Who did it? [Vehicle drives off] They went off, and they blinded me! I couldn't see! Alright. Let me see! Alright. You're okay. You're alright now. Shh... Alright. Now come on. Shh... I'm here now. Shh... [Honk honk] I'm going, mom! Have fun! Be home by 6:00! I love you, mom. Just wanted you to know. Bye! Bye. Hi, Carla. Bye. [Telephone rings] Hello? Hi, Jean. Is Jenny there? Carla? I thought she was with you. No. I dropped her off at the park. She met some guys in a red monte Carlo. When I got back from getting gas, she was gone. What guys? What monte Carlo? I don't know. I'm sure it's cool. When she gets in, ask her to call me. [Click] Mom, uh, is everything alright? Is Jenny with you? No. She's not here. Did you see her at the park? No. I've been here at my cousin's birthday party all day. She's probably with Steve. I called. He's not home. I'm getting really worried. You know Jenny. She's probably out with some friends. I'll check it out. But I got to go now. Okay. Bye. Bye. Oh, my god. [Thunder] Frank...frank, frank, just listen. I already called the police. They said she probably ran away. I told them, "I don't think so. My house is the place kids run to!" I'm not hysterical. You're too calm. She's your daughter, too. Look, alright. Alright. Let's not fight. Yeah...I'll call you when I know something. Tell me something, Collins. Does this ever get any easier? In a word...No. Let's go. [Rings doorbell] No-o-o-o-! No! No! No! No! Mom. Take her arm. Jean! Mom! Jean! No! No! No...no. [Sobbing] [Crying] [Knock on door] I heard it on the late news. Oh, Jean. I don't understand. Everybody loved Jenny. Who would do this to such a sweet, beautiful girl? If I hadn't gone to that... Stupid birthday party, I would have been with her, and this wouldn't have happened. It's not your fault, Ellen. You were always there for her. No! No, we had a fight, and... I never got a chance to apologize. And now she's gone forever. I want to die, too. Don't say that. Where's Celeste? She's at, uh, Diane's house. I moved back there. What about Dan? Well, that's just it. Uh... My fight with Jenny was his fault, and, after I found that out, I couldn't live with him anymore. I should go. Could you... Could you stay here tonight? Okay. [Sobbing] "With faith in Jesus Christ, "we reverently bring the body of our sister Jennifer Anne Monroe "to be buried in its human imperfection. "Let US pray with confidence to god, "who gives life to all things, "that he will raise up this mortal body to the perfection "and the company of the saints. Amen." Amen. Amen. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. Lord, have mercy. [Choir singing in Latin] Just give me a minute. Is everything alright? She's having trouble breathing. Slow, Jean. Deep breaths. Dizzy. Can't breathe. God is with Jenny now, Jean. You have to believe that. He's with you right now. He'll--he'll help you be strong. Shut up about god! What kind of god takes a beautiful girl like her? I blame god! See you. You want to come in, Mrs. Monroe? We've been canvassing the neighborhood. Your daughter was very popular. Have a seat. Jenny saw only the good in people. I guess she learned that from me. Do you have any suspects? Well, our best lead is from Carla Lewis, the boys in the red monte Carlo. Her description matches some pretty tough characters we know. We're running a check on them. We're also checking into every red monte Carlo registered in the state. Her things, Mrs. Monroe... Like you asked. Put them in a paper bag, Collins. It's alright. Thank you. Uh, miss staley-- is it miss? It's detective staley, actually. You don't know me, but you're going to. I'm a little woman with a big mouth, and I will not rest until whoever killed my daughter is caught and punished. That makes two US, because neither will I. And it's Mrs., by the way. I have a daughter Jenny's age. Jean. I'm pat. Ellen, got a minute? I need your help. You were Jenny's best friend, right? Definitely. I need to know everything about her, and you know her more than anybody. Cool. Let's take a walk. It's too freaky. It's like... I'm getting in on the investigation or something. Slow down, Ellen. What are you talking about? The cops think Carla had something to do with Jenny. They didn't say in so many words, but they don't buy her story. I mean, it's so sick. If you can't trust your friends-- calm down. You're going to hyperventilate. It's just sick, Jean. I mean-- stop! Just think for a minute. Carla? She was one of Jenny's best friends. I know it's crazy, but the cops suspect. They were asking me-- cops suspect everyone right now. They're talking to lots of people. I'm just trying to help. I just-- I want to get whoever did it, the animal who murdered my best friend. Ellen, honey, I understand. Believe me, I want it, too, more than I've ever wanted anything in my life. You see it on the news every night, the violence out there, but always out there, happening to somebody else. I didn't expect it to happen to me. I thought I could protect my family. I could make my little corner of the world safe. I was wrong. Now we have to stick together. All we've got is each other. Are you with me? I'm sorry, Jean. You're right. We're going to be strong now, right? Right. Whee! Higher! Oh, no, that's high enough. Jenny fell off the swings when she was your age. That's how she got that scar she has on her knee. When's Jenny coming back? [Tires screech] Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait! Next? Hi, Carla. I've missed you. Where've you been keeping yourself? You know... School. This job's been keeping me busy. Can I get you something? Loaf of rye, sliced. Carla, tell me about the day you went off with Jenny. What do you know about the guys driving the red monte Carlo? 2 bucks. I already told the cops. I don't know them. Excuse me. I have some bread in the oven. Ellen? It's all so real. I know. The pictures, Jean, they're so sad. It's like-- doesn't it bother you? I see her everywhere. The only time I don't feel numb is when i'm looking at them. You'll always have her in your heart. Where do you want the ice? Put it out back. Hi. Hi. What about US? Uh, start the fire. Mom. Sure you're up to this? I'm fine. It'll be good for all of US. Go on. Go on. Okay. I know what you're trying to do, and I appreciate it. Maybe... Maybe for the party, you should put the pictures away. We don't need another wake around here. Hey, guys. I hear the cops are staking out different houses. Yeah? Like whose? Turner's, for starters. That guy is always so wasted. He could have done it. Hey, Jean. Sausages are almost ready. What? That's Jenny's jacket. Well, yeah. I wanted to, like... Honor her, you know? Take it off. I didn't--i didn't mean to, uh-- I know. I'm going to put Celeste down for her nap. Come on, baby. I don't want to be here. It gives me the creeps. Just check this out. Come here. Uhh. Later. Later. See ya. Bye. Where'd you get this? I cut it out of this morning's paper. Should we tell Jean? Tell Jean what? Hi, guys. Have a good one. Why didn't you tell me? I'm her mother. I have a right to know. Tell you what? How she died. They beat her, cut her hair off, they pinned her down with a 100-pound log. What? It's all right in here. Calm down. I want answers. You won't get any until you calm down. Thank you. There's certain information we never release to the public-- not to the family, the press, not anybody-- information only the killer knows. If we get a confession, we know it's the truth. How'd it get in the paper? I don't know, but I'm going to find out. The killer called the press? I don't know! You don't know much, do you? Now, wait-- no, I've waited long enough. You don't have a clue. What do you care? Your daughter's fine. Everybody says, "let the police handle it. Get on with your life." What life? Jenny was my life. If you're not going to find her killer, I will. That's a mistake. Let US-- go to hell. Do our job. I hate this house. I hate this neighborhood. Every time I look outside, I see Jenny. She's in every room. I have to do something. I can help. I don't want you to get involved. It could be dangerous. I know what you mean. I feel it, too. Inside my head, in my dreams, it's like she's telling me to find her killer. When I do, he's going to pay. You need me, Jean. I know the people you have to talk to. I know where they hang out. I know that I can't replace Jenny, but I love you like a mother, Jean, and you can't do it by yourself. You'll help me? I'd do anything for you, Jean. You know-- oh, no. Never mind. It's too much. What? Tell me. I had a flash. I--i could move in. That way we would be in total touch. We'd have more time, and I could drive Adam to school in the mornings. We'd be a team. Well, what about Celeste? She could stay at Diane's. No. No, she should be with you. What do you think, Adam? I like the ride to school part. I vote yeah. [Telephone rings] Hello? Carla, it's me. Ellen, the cops were here again. So what? They keep questioning me, the same thing over and over. Stick to the story. They don't buy it. [Sniffles] I'm scared. You stupid idiot, do you want to spend your life in prison? Hell, no. Then do exactly what I say. No matter what happens, keep telling them about the red monte Carlo. Get a grip. I've got you covered. What do you-- what do you mean covered? I'm moving into Jean's house. That way I'll be able to keep tabs on every move the cops make. [Knock on door] [Hangs up] All set? Definitely. I told you, Jean's not here. She's at the store. How could you move in here? I belong here. I have a conscience, Ellen. I can't keep this inside. I have nightmares all the time. I have to tell someone. Tell who? Tell what? Let go of me. Now... Now, listen to me, Kathy. You're going to keep your tongue in your mouth, or I'm going to cut it out. You understand? Yes. I don't believe you. Now... What are you going to do? Keep my mouth shut. What else? [Sobbing] I'm going to... Get out. Move away. Far away. Far away. Good. [Car door closing] Get going! Hi, Jean. Let me help you with those. Thanks. Was someone here? Kathy. She left in a hurry. She was upset. She has to move away. Oh, that's too bad. She's a nice girl. Did you get everything you needed? It's not like I asked the salesperson what the well-prepared woman needs to track down a red monte Carlo. We should take some blankets. It'll be cold. How about a flashlight? Let's see you make it. Aw! Aw! I'm nervous. I have knots in my stomach. Me, too. Well, I'm glad to be finally doing something. I know what you mean. Do you remember how you used to braid Jenny's hair? Yeah. Jenny had such beautiful hair. Would you-- So what are the cops doing? Nothing. Since my tantrum last week, they don't even return my calls. I hate cops. I want to be with you anytime you talk to them. I don't want them upsetting you. I'll go with you anytime, anywhere. A team, right? Right. [Tires screech] There's the car I saw earlier. When I went after them, they took off. Let's get 'em. Go for it, Jean. You know Jenny Monroe? Who? Her. Any of you here October 1st, around 3:00 in the afternoon? She got into a red monte Carlo, like this one. Whose car is this? It's mine. Who are you people? I'm her mother. She was murdered. You know anything about it? Tell me. Ellen? Susan, hi. I didn't see you. What's going on? You know them? They're cool, Jean. Why are you doing this, Ellen? The cops already checked US out. They know we were at the movies that day. I'm sorry about your daughter, ma'am, but we didn't have nothing to do with it. You scared the hell out of them, Jean. You said they were cool. How do you know that? Jenny didn't like them. She'd never get in a car with them. If detective staley isn't in, let me speak to her partner. Uhh! When will they be back? No, they're in charge of my case. They're the only ones who can help me. [Thunder] [Tapping on glass] Uh-huh. I know what you've been up to, Jean, for the past couple of weeks, right? And I told you this is a mistake. A mistake? A mistake to love my daughter? To want her killer punished? Of course not. But this isn't the way. What is the way? You're making my job more difficult. Oh, I'm really sorry about that. Tell me who killed Jenny. I wish I could. Actually, I can't discuss the details of the investigation with you. We are working on the case, and we do have leads. What leads? Look, I understand how you feel. Really, I do. I keep thinking one day she's just going to walk through the door. "Hi, mom," she'll say, "miss me?" I thought I heard her in her room last night. I had to go in there and check. I turned down her bed for her. You must think I'm nuts. You're not nuts. You're a mother who loved her daughter. I still love my daughter. You look terrible, mother. Morning, Greg. Adam says you've been doing this every night. If you were concerned, why didn't you talk to me? Because you never listen. What's going on, everybody? Do you mind? This is a family discussion. I thought I was part of the family. It's okay. Go on back to bed. That's part of the problem right there. What's that mean? She's got you running all over, confronting people, acting crazy. I don't want to talk about it. Tough. You could get yourself hurt, not to mention what it's doing to your health. What do you want me to do, forget about Jenny? No! If I knew who did it, I'd kill him myself! But I don't know. None of US does. She's gone, ma. We got to let her go. We can't allow what happened to her to destroy the rest of US. Adam needs you, mom. I need you. We're your children, too. And sheryl. I didn't want to have to tell you like this. We're finally going to have that baby you wanted. She's pregnant. Great, sheryl. Oh, honey! The doctor says I can return to work in three weeks. I'm looking forward to it, too. Thanks, Mr. Riordan. Okay. See ya. Bye. Going back to work, huh? Soon. Good. Listen, I've been thinking. Maybe we've been obsessing over Jenny too much, keeping her room exactly as it was. We should put some of her stuff away. I've been thinking the same thing. Great. I'll just get my clothes. What for? To move into her room. No, Ellen. I'm turning it into a nursery. Sheryl's pregnant. When's she due? June. Congratulations. Okay. Well, maybe in the meantime, I can just-- I said no, Ellen. I thought you wanted to let Jenny go and move on. You're welcome to stay... In my room. Now let's drop it, huh? Whatever. [Telephone rings] Hello. I'll be right there. [Telephone rings] Hello. Carla. It's me. Guess where I am. [Bell rings] The principal's a jerk. He's on my case for no reason. I'm really ticked at you. You are? I am. Cutting school, getting in fights. Are you trying to get my attention? I admit I've been preoccupied. I know you're feeling ignored. I miss Jenny, too, mom. Are we ever going to be a family again? Oh, Adam. We never stopped being a family. From now on, let's just try to be there for each other, huh? Okay. What about her makeup and stuff? Box it up for Ellen. We could do this another time. No. Let's get it over with. Thought maybe we could hang this over the crib. I'm going to miss this with Jenny. I know. I've been racking my brain. I've been trying to think. I ran into this guy. He gave me the chills. What guy? This guy Turner, he's a biker, total loser. Rides this big Harley, and one day Jenny said she'd turn him in to the cops. A Harley. I remember him from the park, labor day. He almost ran Jenny over. He'd kill anybody who'd rat him out. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't think about it until I saw him today. There! He always hangs out here. Hey! Hey! You tried to run down my daughter. What the hell is your problem? You said you'd kill her. Now she's dead. He's the one, Jean. We're going to the police. You're crazy. You don't know how crazy. I got some abc-type information for you, lady. Your daughter thought she was too good for US, when in reality, she was nothing but a stuck-up little bitch. She got what she deserved. You're going to have to pay for that window. Fine. Am I under arrest? Turner declined to press charges. Hooray for Turner. Are you charging him? With what, Jenny's murder? Yes! He's the right type, real bad guy. He said she got what she deserved. He may have said that, but he didn't do it. How do you know? Because he was in jail at the time. I know you think you're doing something positive, running around and terrorizing the neighborhood. Some people won't talk to US. They're afraid you'll harass them. You're hurting the investigation. What investigation? You haven't done a thing. What do you know about Ellen holloway? Oh, that's classic. You want to pin it on Ellen? I didn't say that. She was at her grandmother's house. That's not what I asked you. We think a female was involved, both because of the hair cutting and the newspaper story. The newspaper people tell US their informant was "a young woman." I've known Ellen since she was 5. She's like a daughter to me. She's been helping me, which is more than you've done. Why are you pushing this so hard? Let me do my job. You're not doing it. Like you? Is that what you're thinking, Jean? That you didn't do your job with Jenny? I've been a cop for a long time, and a mother even longer. I'm od'd on human nature. You want to know what I see? I see a woman acting out a whole lot of guilt. I keep replaying it in my mind. Maybe if I'd been a different kind of mother, Jenny would be alive today. I wanted my kids to like me so much. Where do you draw the line between parent and friend? You've got to stop torturing yourself. I've known so many kids who turned against their parents. I didn't want that to happen to me. I wanted to protect her without making her afraid to live. I failed. No, you didn't. You did the best you could. I'll tell you something else. All the calling and pestering you've done has made the department work harder on the case. Good. Stop playing vigilante out there. I don't want you getting into any trouble. I sure don't want to see you get hurt. Are you okay? What did those damn cops do to you? I'm fine, honey. Really. You're going to love this. Guess who they suspect? Who? You. No, uh, it's too weird. It's just scary. Just say it, Ellen. Tell US what happened. Celeste woke up out of a dead sleep and said, "Jenny got hit with a rock." "Jenny got put underwater." "I hear Jenny screaming." She probably just had a nightmare. How did she know about the getting beat up or the water? She must have overheard US. Jean... She said Jenny told her. I think Jenny's around her. Around me. I feel it. Sometimes I even see her. Jenny got hit with a rock. She's bleeding. I'm going up there, to the woods. Why? Maybe the cops missed something, some evidence. Ellen, it's the middle of the night. Then leave Celeste here. Jenny is telling me to go. I'm going now. I'll do it alone. Go with her, Greg. You got to be kidding. I'll worry. Not you, Adam. I want to go. I need a man here. Where do we go? The paper says it happened at the creek, east of the parking lot. Ellen? Wait. I got the map. I'm letting Jenny guide me. Trippy. Very trippy. This gives me the creeps. I can feel her. So close. It must have happened somewhere around here. Jenny's in the water! There she goes! Hey! What's that? You said you were never up here. I've never been near here in my life. Dan must have carved it. Dan. He always wanted Jenny. Yeah. She wouldn't have anything to do with him. Come on, guys. What are you saying? I'm saying Dan couldn't have Jenny. He didn't want anybody else to have her. He'd go nuts if I even called her on the phone. He threw firecrackers at her on labor day. How do you know that was him? I was there with him. He takes off. I follow him. He whips a handful of ladyfingers at her and runs off laughing. That was Dan, huh? Jean should hear this. No. She's exhausted. Let her sleep. Dan wasn't even at Jenny's funeral. Everybody was at Jenny's funeral except him. Why? I'm sure the cops have talked to him. They're idiots, sheryl. Don't you get it? Don't yell at her. It's your sister. Whose side are you on? Okay. One night, Dan and I had a fight about Jenny. He said she'd get mixed up with somebody who'd kill her for the crap she pulled. His exact words. Hello? Dan, this is Ellen. I want to ask you something. Did it matter to you when Jenny was killed? It's 3 A.M. what is this? You hated Jenny. Admit it. She wouldn't come back to you. She wouldn't sleep with you. She totally blew you off. You took her into the woods, didn't you? No way. You're a liar. You're nuts, Ellen. I will! What'd he say? He said prove it. He did it. And he has to pay. You're damn right. He deserves to die. Kill him? Are you crazy? Let's get him over here. Give him the chance to confess. What for? He'll probably just lie. He must have lied to Jenny to get her up there. Then he dragged her down the path, beat the hell out of her, threw her in the stream and drowned her like a cat. I can see it. I'll take care of it. How? I can get a gun, that's how. Dump the body in the woods somewhere. Get some pool acid and pour it over him. By the time they find the body, the won't be able to identify it. And one more thing. Bring me back a finger. Proof that he's dead. Why didn't you wake me? One thing led to another. You should have stopped it. This is totally out of control. Where does Dan live? On Garber, why? Adam, go to your room. Mom! Do it! What's the address? What are you doing? Stop it. I am going to stop it. This has gone way too far! You said you wanted him to pay, and that's what Steve's going to do. What happened? You didn't do it, did you? No. No? What do you mean no? I was pumped to do it. When I got to the window, when I saw him, it hit me. I don't think he killed her. I can't believe it. You blew it! You were her boyfriend. You loved her. You said you'd do anything for her. Big man! If you want him dead, kill him yourself. You make me sick! You're nothing. Gutless! Ellen! Stop it! I'm just doing this for you, Jean. Doing what, Ellen? First it was Turner. I was ready to kill him. He was innocent. Now it's Dan. Who's next? You don't understand. It's because I love you. And I love Jenny. That's fine. It means a lot to me. But this vengeance thing, it has to stop. We're tearing each other apart. I'm sorry, Jean. You're right. I'm sorry. [Sighs] I don't know where to begin, Jenny. I've been doing a lot of crazy things. We all have. But we still don't know who put you here. I won't give up. But I have to stop looking for revenge. It can't bring you back. I'll never accept that you're gone, Jenny. But I have to learn how to go on and take care of all my family. And I have to let you rest in peace. I love you, baby girl. What's bothering you, Jean? Nothing. No. Something's wrong. A daughter can tell. Things change, Ellen. I've been wanting to talk to you. I want to thank you for being here for me, for everything you've tried to do. What are you trying to say? I've been selfish with you. I've sort of taken over your life. It's not right. No, I'm not being truthful with you. The truth is, I can't be your mother. You have a family now. Staying here is holding you back. No. No, that's not true. I love being here. I mean, I've-- you've helped me grow so much. I'll miss you. But we're a team. I'm better now... Thanks to you. Go home, Ellen. [Shrieks] Unh! One more bottle of diet. Shoppers, please remember our special on Alan farms turkeys. Celeste, we can't afford it. You're so selfish. Well... Oh, my god, Jean! Look who's here. You look great. Thanks. Long time, Ellen. What is it, a year? Almost, yeah. How you doing? Good. Really good. I see you're going to make your famous, um... Pumpkin pie for Turkey day, huh? I'm glad I ran into you. I was going to call you. I wanted to invite you for Thanksgiving. Oh, sorry. We have other plans. You sure? Mm-hmm. If you change your mind. Okay. Give Jean a kiss. We got to go. Come on. Bye. Ooh! Look at that! Come on, Lisa. Look at the Turkey. He's here! [Applause] That looks wonderful. I thought you were eating it all yourself. I forgot to bring in the, um... Carving knife and the fork. Grandma's homemade cranberry sauce. Okay. Looks great. [Doorbell rings] Thank you, father. We're here! Hi, Ellen, Celeste. I thought she wasn't coming. Happy Thanksgiving. I guess she changed her mind. Uh, set two more places, and let's treat her like family, okay? Happy Thanksgiving! Ooh, Celeste, you look so pretty. Give me a hug. Ooh! Go get some Turkey. I'm glad you could come. Let's eat, huh? [Baby gurgles] [Door opens] What are you doing? I just had to hold her. Come on. We're having dessert. Have you heard anything from the police lately? I don't care to talk about it today. Today we're giving thanks for what we have. [Knock on door] You'd better hear this, Jean. Now. Hear what? I ain't got nothing to say. She's toast. She won't talk. Let me at her. I can get the truth out of her. Okay. I can't do it. What do you mean, you can't do it? You have to tell these people the truth. I can't take much more of this. I'm trying to put it all behind me. She'll talk now. Excuse me. I dropped Jenny off at this community center. She owed Jimmy... Marquez 500 bucks because he fronted her the money for some coke. She left with him. That never happened. You're lying. No, I'm not! Do you know where Marquez is now? Do you know? Do you know where he is now? No. No. Jean, come in here, please. Look at Jean. Look at Jean. Look at your friend's mother. Look at what she's going through. I want you to look into her eyes, and tell her the lies you've been telling me. I swear I'm not lying. Jenny was not into cocaine! But you are, aren't you? You are! I--i can't think. You can't think. Why, after a year, does she come forward and change her story? For one thing, Marquez is conveniently dead. He was shot last month. When he was alive, he didn't have 5 bucks in his pocket-- much less 500. Everything Carla told US from the beginning was a crock. Why go from one lie to another? Maybe this is the truth. Your daughter was not into drugs. How do you know that about Jenny? I know you think we've slacked off. The fact is, I've never stopped looking for the bastard who killed your daughter. They didn't buy it. It doesn't matter. They can't prove anything. Besides, they'll never figure it out anyway. I was afraid for my life... So I ran away. Tried not to think about what happened... To Jenny. And the pain her family... You know, suffered... The grief. You see, when somebody dies, they're not the only ones who suffer. I never knew that.... Until my brother died. I finally understood what Jean was going through. I couldn't hide anymore. Because I didn't tell for so long does that make me an accessory or something? Kathy, did you kill Jenny? No. Did you have any part in it? No. I mean, I was there, but i-- then you won't be held responsible for anything. Okay? Now, just tell me what happened. I was staying with Ellen at the time. That day she said, "let's go to the park." Carla was there. She had picked up Jenny. So there never was any red monte Carlo? No. Carla made that up. Or Ellen did. I don't know why Ellen wanted me there. I-- what happened in the park? We all started driving out towards the woods. That's where it all began. As we were driving up the hill, Carla turned off to a road on the right. Ellen and I were right behind her. Can you describe this road? Gravel. Single Lane. It went off to a parking lot by a creek. What did Ellen and Carla do? They started yelling at each other. Calling each other names. Like, real sarcastic voices. I guess that was their plan-- to make it seem like they hated each other. Then they turned on Jenny, and let her know that they were really against her. How did they do that? It was something like, "we don't really hate each other. It's you we hate." Why were they mad at her? They said she had slept with their boyfriends. Then Ellen and Carla started naming off other boys. What was Jenny doing at this point? She was crying. Then what happened? Carla said, "let's take a walk." Ellen, I swear I didn't do anything. Shut up, liar! [Sobbing] Please, don't! Please! What are you doing? What are you crying for, huh? Look at me, whore! Look at me, whore! You took away Steve! Hold her. What are you doing? [Sobbing] Now the boys might not like it so much. So sorry. Please! I swear I didn't do anything. I swear. Come on out here, Jenny. The water isn't too deep. No, don't! Where are you going? I'm just going to the car. Kathy, wait, please! Please! Don't kill me, please! Aah! Get something to hold her down. Help me! Aah! Aah! What happened? We had to cover the body. What did you do? I got to get rid of these. They'll know. Wait, wait! Carla, answer me! No. No. No! G-Get in. We're going to get the hell out of here. Get in! [Honk] Aah! What happened? I killed her. Ellen and I killed...Her. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh... Oh, my god! I killed Jenny! Jenny's dead! Maybe I didn't. Maybe I should go back and make-- no! I got to go back! I don't want to go! I just want to go home. Okay. Anyway, she deserved it for screwing my boyfriend. [Kathy] She just drove away like nothing had happened. I taught those girls how to swim. To drive. Everything. Those girls were my daughter's best friends. On the surface. Inside, Ellen was burning up with jealousy. Jenny was everything she wasn't... And could never be. What about Carla? Carla's a follower. She was Ellen's puppet. Like I became Ellen's puppet. I mean, my god, to move into my home... Become my daughter. Hmm. Sick. That was the other part. Jenny wasn't enough. She wanted Jenny's mother. I loved her like she was my own. She's brilliant... Diabolical. She moved into your house so she could watch you suffer. And it gave her the opportunity to misdirect the investigation. Every time I paid less attention or said she was under suspicion, she went into her act. How could I be so stupid? Don't blame yourself. She fooled a lot of people. You're a loving, trusting person... Just like Jenny. That's what got her killed, isn't it? No. She trusted and loved the wrong people. Look, I know this isn't much, but I can arrange for you to be there when I bring them in. Make this fast. I don't have all day. Here, Lisa. Oh, look. Beautiful girl. * happy birthday to you * * happy birthday to you * * happy birthday, dear Lisa * [laughing] * happy birthday to you * [crying] * happy birthday to you ** grandma's watching. Ohh! [Laughing] Oh, honey. Yes. Alright, go to mommy. Mommy. Come to mom. Mom. What are you doing out here? Oh. I was just counting my lucky stars. Come on inside. They got to get going. I'll be in in a minute. Okay. We love you, Jenny. Sleep with the angels. [Child giggles] [Plop] Oh!
