How much money was in there? You know, I didn't actually count it. Ballpark it. Feel that? Yeah, I fucking feel that. Fuck. - You having trouble with that? - Yeah, I am. There it is. Shit. Joshua. Joshua, hurry up! My ointments. Jesus. Oh, my God, is it really that hard? No, it's just, that... Never mind. Why are you dressed like this? They're giving me a chance to do sales today and one of the Healer's big clients is coming into the studio. Which reminds me, we're running low on brain boost and Kava Calm, so, do you have any cash? I don't get paid until Friday. Yeah, we're not going to make it until then. You can borrow some of my Kava Calm. But you need it. Not like you do. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Are we going for a walk today? We are. You are so handsome. You are the most handsome. What the fuck, Joshua. It's time for your medicine, okay? Water? What are you holding in your hand, Joshua? Mm, I feel more focused already. Today's energy rush, silly. I'll be home at like seven, okay? Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Well, good morning, sweet thing. Good morning, Wade. Hey, what's up, Joshua? Hey, you wouldn't still happen to have any of those pills I sold you? I may have a few of them left. The brain boost and the Kava Calm? You know me, I'm naturally calm and intelligent. Can you bring them by later? Yeah, definitely. I'll be home at seven. Hey, Wade, are you done borrowing my blender? Yeah, man, funny story about that, remember that chick, Alexis? So, we've been flirting for a little while, and you know, dancing around the whole idea of the bone ceremony. I saw her at a show last week, we start dancing a little bit, making out, told her come back to my place, she obliges, and the next thing you know. I got to go to work, man. Hey, can I borrow your coffee maker, by the way? Look, man, you're borrowing my blender, my shovel, my air pump... Yeah, but it's all good man, no problem. I have to get caught up on Netflix, anyway. - There's this show... - Cool, bye. No worries. Josh. You're a little late today. We got a lot going on, so I'm going to need you to make getting here on time a pri-o-ri-ty. It is, I know. I'm sorry. It's okay, we'll make up for it later. I need you to be the lead on this one. She's paying cash, - pri-o-ri-ty. - Alright. Oh, and I really want you to see this, come over here. This right here is a steady increase since day one. And right here, that's you, that's a 0.3% increase just in the last quarter. That's a direct result of your commitment and expertise. Shit sells itself, man. Mm, that's what I like to hear. Can't put a price on security, right, Josh? That's right. You seem like someone who's into full body wellness, am I correct? Yeah, I like to take care of myself, sure. Wonderful, may I, may I show you something? - Okay. - Come over here. So, what I have here is a full body wellness system, it's an array of tinctures and ointments, that can really help you reach your full potential. I think this endocrine cleanse tincture would be marvelous for you. Are you interested? I... - Sure. - Wonderful. So that will be $75. Yeah, I'm working on one right now that uses hemp instead of whey protein. - Oh, my God, yes. - So that way you don't get like the inflammation stuff. Yes. You should get paid for this, it's like the best massage I've had in a long time. Yeah, okay gone, later, Rach. See you tomorrow. So, where have you been? I told you I would be home at seven. - The boss made me stay late. - Again? Yeah. And then you just came straight here? Where else would I go? I don't know. I never know with you. What's that supposed to mean? I don't know, dude, at least Wade is always around to keep me company whenever you're staying late at work. Did he bring my blender back? Oh, fuck. What, who is it? What is up, brother? Right now? What's going on? - It's Bucky. - Who? Oh, yeah, that's Rachel, my girlfriend. Um... Yeah, seventh of Moat River, in like 20 minutes. Alright. Well, who was that? Bucky. You already said that Joshua, who in the fuck is Bucky? So, how do you two know each other? Porn. Joshua never told you about his illustrious porn career? No. We met in college. This guy's a real stud muffin. Sprays more thick creamy loads than Starbucks. But I'm sure you know all about his prowess. Anyway, we worked at the same pizza joint. That's a lie. Joshua never showed you the dildo that's an exact mold of his eraser head? Careful. Why have you never talked about this? Yeah, Joshua, why haven't you talked about this? And where can I get one? Anyway, what have you been up to, Bucky? Smoking. That shit will kill you. Why don't you want to talk about your dick? Can you think of more interesting topics to spend time on? Let's talk about your beard. Can I touch it? Where are you staying? - Your couch. - I'm not sure. Yeah, we didn't talk about this. Whose name is on the place? It's not a trick question guys. Mine. Great. BRB. Maybe he'll buy us some of those nicotine addiction drops. Does he have any money? So, porn. Don't pretend to believe him. Maybe you guys should get a real job. Me? Fuck you. What is wrong with him? So much. So much. There's a blanket. There's more beer in the fridge if you need it. What? I got to go to bed man, I work at eight. Sucker. Good night. I could tell him to get a hotel room, but he probably won't. How long? You were as hell as welcome quickly. Dude was never welcomed. He likes to stay beyond the point where everybody is uncomfortable. Wow. He sounds like a great friend, Joshua. Yeah. Who are you? Who the fuck are you? I'm Wade, do you smoke? You fucking leech, you can't buy you some cigarettes? What's up, Wade? Hey, man, who is that guy? That's my old pal Bucky. Hey, you still have that laptop with the webcam on it, right? - Mm-hm. - Well, there's this app called Naughty Neighbor, but it's not like that, it's this app where we can live stream in between each other's houses, so it's like we're hanging out all the time. Are you a naughty neighbor, Wade? Dude, fuck off. Hey, man, can I get some coffee, if you don't mind? - Yeah, it's right back there. - I, I was just... All right, so, anyway, what I was saying about that app. Who is this shipped basket? Well, this is my naughty neighbor, Wade. Why is he here? I don't know, he just shows up every morning. Joshua! I need a smoothie, I kept fucking waking up last night. Oh, my God, dude. Can you please get your smelly bum hole out of my blanket? - Hey, morning sunshine, I think Joshua is in a little webcam... - Definitely not into it. Well, I think it sounds adorable, Wade. Joshua, smoothie! Wade still got our blender. - Why's he going to the bedroom? - Oh, uh, he... he helps her put her shoes on. It's this big ordeal, I used to have to do it all the time, but he's better at it, so. Wade, that tickles! So, yeah, can I get a smoke off you, big man? No. Oh, so, how do you know Josh? We served together. Yeah, Josh is a great guy. If he's a great guy, why are you trying to fuck his girl? It's, it's really not like that, me and Rach just hung out. Fuck you. I catch you hanging out with his lady again, I will knock you out. Drinks after work? Yeah, we need to catch up. No shit, 5:30? Let's go at six to be safe. You're a bitch. I know. Did Joshua leave? Yeah, just now. Oh, my God, man, you smell like cigarettes. I know. - You ever think about quitting? - Rather be dead. Well, if you want I have this tincture that can help you kind of kick that shit to the curb. It sounds like a scam. This is not a scam, this stuff actually works. Do you have any matches? Matches? For what? Oh, gross, dude. You're on time, now that's what I like to see. Technically, I'm early. High pri-o-ri-ty. Oh, I've got to meet a friend after work at like 5:30. You know, I had the hardest time picking a tie today. I've got this other tie, I'm sure you've seen me wearing it. It's more of a plum color. The weird thing is, I don't even have to wear a tie for this job. Yeah, we, we'll see about 5:30, Josh. Rachel, your aura... shines. To me, everything shares a certain beauty. I just work my hardest to reflect that same beauty from within. How did you get to be so wonderful? The healer has shown me so much about the oneness. She's certainly... the most enlightened individual I've ever had the pleasure of knowing. She's one of a kind. I'm sensing some tension. You're so perceptive. Thank you. It's just... ...I'm just running low on Kava Calm right now and it's a really bad time for me to be without it. Especially with everything else that's going on in my life. Just take some brain boost. I don't need my brain boosted, I need... calmness. Kava Calm, brain boost, they're essentially the same ingredients. - Really? - Yeah, I help the healer repackage all of the bulk material, I get to see what goes into everything. I guess that makes sense, if you really think about it. Totally, it makes perfect sense. I feel like that tension is flying away. So, do you want me to buy you that drink at Juniper. Let's go. Another one? Yeah, and two shots, one whiskey and one dealer's choice. Is someone joining you? My friend, was supposed to, but he's late. Sign of the times. What? I don't fucking now. This one's on me. To moms. They make the babies, we are all these babies. You're still here. Great timing, you fuck. You were supposed to be at six, where have you been? I've been at work, you know that place where people go when you're sitting on the couch checking last night's ice cream. It's almost eight o'clock. I'm fucking wasted, do you want a shot? Yes. Two shots. What happened to you? Life. It happens to everybody, you fucking yuppie. What happened to your balls? Don't worry, I'm good. Yeah. Are you going be okay? What would you do if you only had a few months to live? I'd travel. Where? I've always wanted to go to Venice. Ever since I saw a poster on my grandma's wall when I was a kid. Italy? It's a fucking tourist trap, bro. The main ingredient, a lot of their stuff is like sugar. It's like, you know, doesn't do anything. - They make a lot of money? - Yeah. They're basically selling all that shit anyway, you know? Hey, babe. How was your night? Did you just call me babe? Mhm. - Are you drunk? - Mhm. Yeah, we've been drinking. Well, might as well join you. So, what did you two get up to tonight? Drinking, like I said. Since when? Where the fuck have you been? - Does she always give you this much shit? - Yes. Unbelievable, I want to smoke a fucking cigarette. You're drunk. You already said that. Do you think she's going to finish that? I doubt it. - What's up, guys? - What the fuck? Dude, pants, please. Noise is bad. - Hey, good morning. - What's up, Rach? Morning. Hey, do you still have Joshua's blender? I actually have smoothies going back at my place, that's what I came over here to tell everyone. It's with my fucking blender. You let this fuck borrow your blender? - I would love a smoothie, thank you, Wade. - Sweets. Oh, fuck, my head. I fucking hate that guy. Not as much as I do. Why does your girlfriend like him? I guess because they suck in the same way. She's playing you, bro. She's playing my boy. So? So, what? She's playing me, so? That's weak. Is it? - Dude, I love your smoothies. - Yeah, I'm working on it. It still has a little bit of way until it's perfected, but. A little bit of way? It's a work in progress. Ooh, what's up, Bucky? Remember what we talked about? Yeah, like I said, man, me and Rach just hang out. It's, it's not like that. It is like that. I want to smash your face in right now, Wade. But if you go get Josh's blender and you put it back in his kitchen, I won't. All right, it's cool man, tranquilo. - It's all good. - Give me that smoothie. That's a good one strawberry, spinach, kale, it's all from the farmers market. I'll just go get that blender. Joshua? What are you doing? Are you loyal? What? Are-you-loyal? Give me my towel. I see through you. Joshua! Joshua, get up. What? Your friend, and I'm not kidding around, he has to leave today. Not in a day, not in 12 hours, fucking today. He has flapped his flappy helicopter dick... - He's not... - ...around the house enough, spreading his stench. I know for a fact he's one of those people who farts while they're walking around, and lets it be cut by their ass cheeks in this slippery slope and that's how he makes me feel. Okay? Beyond actually physically doing that, he does that to me emotionally, so I need you to tell me right now that you're going to ask him to leave today. I'll talk to him. Bop. We drinking tonight? Why don't we shoot for like eight o'clock. Is that what time you are supposed to get off? No, I get off at 5:30. We'll meet at the tropical place at six, the way you're supposed to do, I'm serious. All right, fine. I'll see you tonight. What are you going to do today? Yoga. Try Gus's class. Focus on your breath. Feel the Earth underneath you. Center yourself within the universe. Sit tight, we'll be back after a brief word from our sponsors. Whether it's for your home or your place of business. We provide the most trusted name in security system solutions to guarantee that what you value most stays safe and secure, 24/7, 365, at Meyer Tweeten Security System Solutions, you are a high pri-o-ri-ty. Josh. Did you get that email I sent you? Yeah, I'm, I'm going to have to take care of that tomorrow. Tomorrow's not going to work. We need it done tonight. We'll have to stay late. I can't stay late. I have plans at 5:30. Hm, me too, champ. Me too. Go do some fucking yoga. Breathe out and release it all into that rift that separates your spirit from the void. I've got to get ready for the next class. Okay? Welcome. I'm here for the two o'clock. Righteous, sign in over here. - We graciously accept your donations. - Donations? We don't charge for participation in our sessions here, but we do graciously accept your donations. Now hold that for two breaths. Um, we're actually closed for a private session. What are you talking about, man? I just paid $75 for a tincture here. Oh, wonderful. And how's that working for you? Yeah, it's great, it's making me shit every 45 seconds. Excellent. Well, if you come back tomorrow, I'll sell you another one that's great for the post cleanse, okay? Perfect, okay. I'm going to have you lift your right leg, mm-hm. Now go ahead and sink your hips, while breathing out. Let it all out, brother. Now put your right leg forward. And open your arms out like this. That's where you're one. Rugged. You are holding so much in your chest. Enough to kill a man, bro. Yeah, brother. Oh! You're still here. Hi, Rachel, so good to see you. You guys know each other? Brilliant, Bucky, you have to come with us to Kava Break. No, I don't think that's a very good idea. Sounds good. Do you even know what Kava is? It's a root with common properties, typically served in liquid form. And it loosens connective tissue and assists in breaking up phlegm, which could really help you out with your respiratory release that you need, so, very badly. I'm glad we took a Kava Break, guys. The energy was just not right in that space. Thank you. So, how do you two know each other? Bucky is staying on my couch. Joshua's couch. Joshua, what a beautiful man, he's so... accepting. Yeah. Does he know? Does he know what? Bucky is sick. Yeah, no shit. Do you know what it is? It's really just a... ...waiting game. So you're just seeing the people that matter and... ...powering through the pain. Basically. He's a leech. I accept your judgment. You're so strong, brother. You're so strong. Thank you. You're stronger than me, brother. I just want you to know that there is a hope. Okay. What happened? Are you leaving? I'm going to meet Joshua. Will you tell him I think he's an angel? I will. Rachel. I don't know how you do it. Life is so beautiful, so intricate, so fleeting. Teach me. I want to caress your love flower. He's late again. Yeah. Another shot? Fuck, yeah. Bartenders are my only real friends. You only like me for my booze. You only like me for my tips. What's up? Just wasting my last moments on Earth with your stupid ass. That's bleak. Not when you're surrounded by friends. How was yoga? She's cheating on you. You sure? Yeah, you want to see pictures? No, I don't want to see pictures. To infidelity. That's it. What? Some man flying to a murderous rampage is such news. Yeah. Unbelievable. I hate to tell you the real bad news. She's fucking Wade too? Welcome back, brother. Look, man, when you show up, everything changes. Well, this time is different. How? "I'm the boss and there's priorities." "I don't really give a fuck about priorities." And then my buddy comes to town, he's like, "Well, I'm really sick and I think there's all these problems." " I'm mad at you but you know what? maybe, maybe, you can buy some of this stuff to feel better. I know these two people, let's go talk them." "Okay." Du-du-du-du. "Uh-uh, we're magical, potion, healing people, whoa." "We have an aura." So then, they're all over there, and they're all like, "Oh, my God, you're all sick and we're healing you." And I'm like, "Okay, they're not looking so I'm going to go right over here." "I'm not going to be in double for this tomorrow, I'm just going to, I'm just going to sell you some tinctures, because that's, that's what I do." "What's he doing here?" "I don't know, don't look at him, maybe he'll just go away." Hey Josh, we're going to need to back up this entire backlog, today. Super. Now, Josh, that doesn't sound like the attitude that helped this company grow by over half a point in sales last quarter. Maybe that attitude is only around half a point at a time. Not quite sure how to handle this from you, Josh, this is, uh, well, not what I expect from you. Nice jacket. Yeah, you know, I must have found this in the, the company lost and found. I can't exactly remember where it comes from... "Well, looks a lot like a jacket I know." I feel like gets my shade of blue. Mm-hm. I feel like it's my shade of blue, because you know, I used to have a jacket a lot like that, "Do you remember? You remember," "I remember." You know Josh, I've meaning to ask you, do you like the no tie look? What do you think? I've been kind of rocking without the ties. "What do you thinking, do you like the new no tie look?" "No, I think it's fucking stupid." Maybe I'll just take care of that backlog today, you just... keep doing what you're doing. "This is some really important work, Joshua." "Well, maybe while you go and to take care of it, I'm going to go take a yoga class, and I'm going - to fuck your girlfriend." - What was that, Josh? "I think he's gone, he's still talking but he's gone." God damned blinds closed all day. What's up? Have you ever thought about how humans only use like three percent of their brains? That's not accurate. Yes, it is. No, it's not. The commonly misstated figure is ten percent. But the truth is that almost all human beings use 100% of their brain, just it only takes about ten percent of it to handle the simple motor functions that make up our daily lives. Why did you seem so into it when Gus was talking about it? Gus wasn't talking about my brain. He said you were sick. It's different. It's just the same thing to everyone. Sounds sketchy. No, the system is not sketchy. You know, it's, um. It's for people who want to reach their maximum potential. Is this the same thing Josh has been spending all this money on? Yeah. You know, I can never really tell if he actually believes in any of it. If he's putting his money into it, he believes in it. Yeah. Well, he's always bitching about it. The whole thing is just something I really believe in. Go on. You know, the whole process and system of the different supplements and treatments. How does it work for someone like me, who's actually sick? Like sick, sick? I'm dying. We're all dying, man. I'm coughing out chunks of my lungs until I vomit. Is there an ointment for that? I have a tumor. The size of a grapefruit in my diaphragm. So, your tincture, that can help with that? You need to see the healer. I don't believe it. Did you not strop? I'm a real boy now. Heard about this healer? Yeah. What kind of bullshit have you got in yourself caught up in this town? You know, I wasn't sure at first. But now I see the path. She's not going to bail out, man. That doesn't matter. You just need to get a meeting. It will change everything. I worry about what's going to happen to you when I'm gone. You have to quit worrying about that. You need to go see this healer. Why are you here? That's a good question. Why are you here? That is always an interesting question. Let us think about the answer. I'm done. Your friend is very sick. Thanks. Dude, what was that? I have no fucking idea. - What are you doing here? - You know what. No, I don't, this is some fucked-up hippie pyramid scheme. Focus. I am focused. This is a waste of time. I've put a lot of money into this. I'm about to lose my job, wasting time here with you. Who fucking cares about your job? What the fuck is wrong with you, bro? Forget about your country friends and their voodoo spells. Everything seems special for a moment or two. Look at you. Yeehaw! Yeah. Yeehaw! - Yes. Yes! - Yeah, right there. Yes! I want it all. Rachel come here, come here. Hi. Hey. I have really good news. Yeah? The healer has approved Bucky for the soul cleanse. What's going on? It's this really special procedure that she's basically the only person in the US that knows how to do it. She's going help me get better? Yeah. What's the catch? There is no catch. She's going to do it out of the peerless of her heart. Well, it is $20,000. You got 20 grand, bro? Ain't that little steep? Well, what is over life, work? I mean, what is... Bucky's life worth? Way more than $20,000 you all. - We can do this. - Yeah. This... is going save Bucky. Let us all think about what we have to contribute. Mm. Joshua owns this house. I have a mortgage. Well, what if we used it as collateral? Do you have the deed here? Yeah, I do. Is this gin? Are we celebrating yet? I need you to stay late tonight, Joshua. Yeah, sounds good. What do we got here? - Wade! - Hey, can I invite a friend in? That's some good stuff. Feel my heart in shock. Can I stay here? Oh, babies... You look so hurt. What have you done to yourselves? Juniper. You are hungover. All of you. Yes, all of us. I feel all right. Are you ready? Yeah. Is he? He is. Get him ready. No fucking way. Bucky? He couldn't have. Fuck me. Un-fucking-believable. How much money was in there? You know, I didn't actually count it. Ballpark it. Say 600,000. She makes $600,000 selling tinctures? Who knows what else she was into. Why is it doing that? Do you feel that? Yeah, I fucking feel that. Do you see a place to pull over? God, damn it. What's wrong with it? I don't know, do you have a computer for running diagnostics? This is like a giant piece of plastic. Shit. - Are you having some car issues down here? - We're alright, thanks. - Sure? - Yeah, I'm sure, thanks. Suit yourselves. We should have fucking stolen his car. Yeah. People work at companies for years. And they'll just keep working for the same shitty boss. And then they'll retire. I don't know how they do it. Are you avoiding something genuine? Yeah, I'm missing out on tons of shit. Who cares, I'm doing the thing that I'm supposed to do. Does the money make you feel good? Yeah, man, I mean, it's nice to have money, you know? Do you ever think about using it to try to build a real life for yourself? Sure, but I don't know how to do that, you know, do you know? There's lot of places we can't go because there might be somebody who remembers us. We need to stay the fuck away from an airport. Airports are the only way to get out of town fast. I say we go to a Greyhound station, figure out some way to launder this money. You can't take a Greyhound to Venice, dude. You did all the heavy lifting this time, anyway. I hope it parts to set up. You just have to stop caring about what people think about you. I don't care what people think about me. Oh, fuck. I don't even know what I'm freaking out about. Neither do I. Seems to me just like last time. And the time before and the time before. When we get everything set up, you're going to do your hibernation thing, and then you're going to show up. Let's say hypothetically, if I wasn't here, what would you have done to make this work this time? I mean. I could steal Gus's crystals. Are those valuable? I should look that up. I don't know anything about it, so that's kind of hard. Or I guess I could have done what you did, and pretend I was sick. That worked pretty well, right? Yeah, it did. I just can't tell if it's real or not. I'm ready to drink my own piss. Do you have to go? No, otherwise I'd be drinking it right now. Maybe these tracks lead to water. I mean. There's plants growing, there's got to be water. Yeah, they need water. Where is the water? Should we dig? Yeah, maybe we should dig. Do you have a shovel? No, I got some paper money. There's flowers here. Is there water into them? There's flowers there too. Come on man, what are you doing? The airport's towards the west, that's towards the sun. Maybe when we get over that ridge we'll see something. Yeah, there's have to be something over there. "I'm also a scared, boy. I'm scared people will miss my colors. I'm scared that people won't see my heart light. I don't even care that you left. I don't even care that you ruined everything. It's okay. It's okay, we're still here in this space. True Josh. True Gus. The house." You sure you don't want anymore? I can't believe they just left it on the window, so. They do it to cool down the pie. Mm. Maybe we should set up a fire. I have a lighter, I just don't have any more cigarettes. Do you see those lights in the distance? Sure do. That's a private airstrip. You go there in the morning. I will go over there together, I guess. You're going alone this time, bud. You're not coming? No. And what are you going to do? I don't know, I have some other jobs that I may catch on with. I don't know yet. But don't go spending your half on cocaine and hookers like you usually do. It's all your money, bud, you do whatever you want with it. You can throw it on the fire for all I care. You really are sick. It's good seeing you. Take care of yourself. Nice, that felt good
