This one is a driving instructor. Take the broom and come here, Ah-huai. How do you clean up the office? It is still very dirty. There is so much rubbish on the floor. Look...the spittoon still hasn't been cleaned up. You are so lazy and keen on pretending Assistant Manager? Your monthly salary is only $130. But you wear a suit to work. And a pair of Dr. Martens shoes. Your watch is an Omega. Your cigarette is Adona. It has a filter, too Bastard! If you are still wearing a suit tomorrow. I'll ask you to be the messenger.

Don't you follow me as you have to meet your boyfriend. What a disgusting guy! Damn you, I understand why you pretend to be a rich man. Since a prostitute looks after you. You really don't need to work. Mr. Bobby, it's not in office hours, and we are not in the company, too. But I can still control you. You depend on women and damage our company's reputation. You're so careful. The hole in the umbrella is on your side. So only you get wet. But she is not getting wet. That's why everyone loves you. I only love him, what's the problem? You are so useless!

I am singing. Can't you see that I am cleaning the car? I took up the driver's job, damn it! What? You have to do this kind of job? What's wrong with him? You are not his maid. Let's get off. Look! Our best friend Mr. Ho, he is a manager. He loves cars so much. He likes to clean it up by himself. Hit you... I'll hit you without mercy. Why did he hit the car? He treats his car as his son and tries to teach it? Ah-huai, can you help me? My car lacks gasoline, give me some. Okay...Take what you want. No...Don't! Wait... Save some of it for your car. I'll drive my Rolls-Royce instead. You! Bastards! How dare you steal my gasoline! Boss, please listen to me. Ah-jing's car is just lacking in gasoline, I thought you are so kind. So I lent a little bit of gasoline to them. They'll give it back tomorrow. Stop! Shut up! Don't interrupt me! You! Thief... That's why I have to spend so much money on gasoline. You dare pick up gasoline on the sly. If I ask you to clean the safe you'll steal all the money inside? Dad, I lost a Parker pen in the company last month. You also lost a pair of glasses in the company, too. You! Thief! We already suspected you. I give you $130 every month but you dare take advantage of me. You! Bastards. You are so useless. I know you, you are a driving instructor. That's why you steal gasoline from my car every month. - What... - I know you too. You were born to be a thief. That's why you are a thief too. Damn you! - It's the first time I've met them. - Right. I am Fifi, the movie star! Yes, she will be famous one day. Bullshit! Damn you Hair Sticker. Damn you! You're enough. We just used a little bit of your gasoline, you don't need to yell at me. Watch out or I'll fix you up. You... Look! My hand is cut. - Dad, let's go upstairs. - Okay... Don't run! I'll go and call the police. Don't argue with these barbarians. I'll accuse you of robbery and damaging my property. I'll call the police. Ah-huai, what should we do? What? Forget it, they just scared us. I know them well. I'll go and flatten them! Take gasoline! How dare you! Are you a man? You are fired without getting a penny. Honey, after I explained to them for a long time, they then promised not to call the police. Coward! Stupid! How can you stand it? If I were you, I would kill him. What are you talking about? I am so useless. I just borrow and spend your money. What? I don't worry about you anymore! Go! Damn you! I want to fight with somebody. The cat has been badly injured. - A thief! - Thief? - Damn it... - Damn you. - Come on. - Help... How dare you come and steal? How dare you! Damn you! Stupid! Don't kick me or I'll be finished. He is still, don't kick him anymore! Damn you! How dare you steal things here? Don't...I am "Snake". What are you doing here? No...I've stolen a radio and wanted to give it to you. Let him go! Tomorrow we will ask you for money. Please give it back to me! - Don't you want to die? - Sorry... Damn you. Get lost. Why are you pretending to be a wolf? This is a wolf roar? Like this? You are wrong! Wolves don't roar like that. You are wrong too! Listen! We should teach them a lesson. Like father, like son. They are so mean. Even for 5 cent worth of fried food, he would only buy after careful consideration. If we burnt his Benz, he would be very upset Good idea, we'll burn his car and take away his son. He will be scared to death, right? Are you kidding? If we hide his son, why don't we kidnap him? Then we ask him for $1 or 2 million and enjoy ourselves! Is it a good idea? Yes, let's blackmail him since you know his schedule well. But it requires a lot of guts. Scared? I have the guts to do it If I get a million, I dare kill anyone or blackmail them. You are good at kidding. - We are serious. - You! - Are you kidding? - Yes. But it is you who proposed this idea. Do you want to quit? I am just kidding. You should do what you said. I am just kidding, don't ask me! Whether for weal or woe, We'll stay together. You are a righteous man, right? You should consider your family. How can you get rich by just working as a makeup man? Now only educated men or popular men can have a bright future. Your dirty job has no prospects. You are too optimistic! What happened if we make a mistake? Do you raise them up for me? Don't ask me anymore. No, we should cooperate together! Are you a righteous man? But we've argued with him, he will suspicious of us. Stupid! They are always arguing with people. They've many enemies too. We would be put in jail if something goes wrong. Touch wood. Don't say so much! If we get 1 million, it is still worthy of taking a risk. I am willing to do so. Do I have a choice? Yes, let's toss up. I'm not a coward. - But I just worry about my family. - How is it? Okay. - Let's toss up. - Okay. How can you force me to do so? Heads or tails? Tails I go. Alright! Tails you go. - Hold on. - What's the matter? Heads I go instead. Make up your mind! Let's see. It's heads! - Heads! - We'll get rich.

Brother Huai! Bastard! How can you say it? Quiet! - Quiet... - Don't cry. Why are you coming here? Don't talk so loud or you'll wake up the residents. Why are you coming here? Tell me or I will fix you up. Take out the stuff in his mouth. Tell us. Sirs, I have had bad luck as I always lose when gambling. But one day, I suddenly heard your great plan, so I wanted to join you. Do we need him? I am so smart. - Smart? No. - Really. - I've got 3 ideas. - Tell us. - First, we quit. - No, it is a pity. We are so happy. - Second, let him join us. - Right. - Third, we'd kill him. - Right. But I prefer to quit together. What? Don't, listen to me. - What? - Listen. Listen...

There are so many people. How can we take action? Let's quit together. Come back! I'll go home! - Where will we go? - Let me take you to a good place. We leave first! Bye... They all have left! Let's go to the Peak. - Why? To take a look. - at the night view. I don't want to go. Come on... Bitch! You are so disgusting. - They all have left. - What can we do? Let me think.

Somebody has been killed. Police. Quick... Why are you so cruel? Sir, he took up a prostitute and they did something immoral. They...killed somebody. Is it really you! Let's go to the police station.

Forget it! After borrowing our money and gambling it away. He dares bother us again. Gambling is fatal. It's better to be a policeman, right? Why are you so obsessed with gambling? - How dare you! - You deserved it! I'm so sorry. I deserved it... Let's stand up! You don't want to be beaten again? I am nearly dead.

I'll fix you up. - How dare you? - Ah-jing. - Damn you - Ah-jing. Say it once more! How dare you? Don't you believe I'll beat you to death?

I really do have bad luck! - Shut up! - Don't shout. - Shut up! - Don't shout. What should we do? Wait a minute! He has a mole on his ear. Let's cut it off and sent it to his father. Maybe we can get some money. - Take it... - Don't...I don't take it. I can't touch it. Let me go... Be careful, take him up... Ah-huai... Pull me up...help... Bury him... Mom! Jing.

Ask Bobby to talk to me! Why? I won't give you a penny! I am so mean. And I have 1 1 sons. I don't worry about him. What? I won't be threatened by you. Mr. Huang, you shouldn't speak like this. If they get angry, your son will die. Bobby has already died. How can you speak like this? Didn't you hear that? when I wanted to talk to Bobby, they refused me without any consideration? Mr. Huang, I assure you that your son is still alive. Accordingly, the kidnappers are not easy to deal with. They belong to a very large crime group. With our experience, We can crack the case sooner or later. But an attractive sum as reward will be very helpful. How much are you willing to offer? It costs money too. How is it... - He is willing to pay money - Really? Hold on...how much does he pay? $500,000 How can you give him a discount? We've already set 2 million. Why did you promise him so easily? Let's phone him again. It's okay! Just ask them to pay step by step. - First we ask for $500,000. - Right. Let's see if he dare call the police. He won't be so impulsive as his son is still in our hands. Maybe. Give me. He called the police. Damn it! Why did you hit me? You're not a lucky guy. Don't argue. Be careful or they'll see us. Don't you say that he dare not call the police? You go to the toilet quite often. What a lazy guy! Who hasn't flush the toilet? It's too wet. I've got to waste a tissue! Action! Am I so lucky? What's happened? Let me go - Hurry... - What are you doing? Let me go...help! Let me go...help! What's happened? Zhu... Don't run! Zhu...here! Freeze. - Or I will shoot you. - Don't run. Stop!

Let's go. - Get in the car. - Come on... - Be quick... - Okay... Let's go. There's no gasoline. Let's get out and push it. How can you be a driver? - Stupid. - Push... Okay... What a clumsy car! Come on... Take him out... Open up...be quick. He is finished. I can't afford to join you. His heart has stop beating! What can we do? Don't yell...don't scare yourself. He is still alive. Right, he has a heart disease. Loosen his clothes! No.81, you are strong enough to use artificial respiration to save him. Take off your mask! Be quick. He has some medicine. He can't open his mouth. Let's open your mouth. Quick... Let's use medicine to spray with him. - Let's spray... - Be quick. He's awake... - Okay... - Your mask. You have put it on! - What about your mask? - My mask? Where is my mask? Open the door. Let's put him in. - Where are you going - Be quick... - I can see nothing - Be quick. They've taken me to countryside. Let talk to him. Mr. Huang, Hi! I am speaking on behalf of our group to welcome you. Quite good! If you sit with your back to the wall, Your upper right corner has 2 controls. The left one is for the light. The right one is for the fan. I hope you like it. In this room,there is a spittoon in the lower left corner. After you use it, just ring the bell. someone will clean it up for you. - l... - Right. Mr. Huang, Let's have some tea. After you've had it, please write a letter to your family and ask them to give us $1 million. I, on the behalf of our President, assure you that, we will let you go after receiving the ransom. "Huang has been kidnapped for 13 days." "The police still have no solution." - Clean it up - Me again? Prices are so high. Vegetables costs $6, celery is $1 for a kilogram. He always has to eat it, so as to lower his blood pressure. He is just like ordering it in a restaurant. Have you bought the medicine? Yes, $20.50 for a bottle. One day we'll go bankrupt. But we don't want to beat him nor be patient towards him. You shit quite often. I like it. I'd love to. What about the "Swordsman fiction"? I haven't finished yet. Give me first or I can't shit! Do you have any hard feeling? What? I enjoy it indeed. I want to spend my whole life here. We've just had a meeting. Our President ordered you to write a letter before 12 o'clock, or you will be punished. What kind of punishment? When Japanese invaded China, I was kidnapped by the robbers. I didn't pay even they pointed 4 guns at me. Later the Japanese used ice water to pour over me, They hit my fingers, beat my foot and burnt my bottom too. I even stood that. Do you think I'm afraid of you? After our punishment, we'll give you an hour to write a letter. If you still refuse, you'll be finished. Let's kill me now! Please write my age on my head stone. An old man died, it's just like sleeping! Damn you! Don't you want to see your son? I don't care. Your son didn't listen to us either. We've killed him already. If you refuse us, you'll get the same fate too. Thanks for killing my useless son! So that he can't waste my money anymore. You've kill my son instead of me? Just kill me too. I don't want to live any longer. Mr. Huang, I've bought some food. Let me prepare the dinner for you! Tonight we eat snake. Let's try a bowl of snake soup. No...I am scared of snake. God blesses Mr. Huang. Be quick...All is ready. Okay... Let try and gamble. If he dies, it just means we have bad luck. Give me back the spittoon. Be quick! God, please don't let him die. Alright... Something has bitten me. Oh, no! Damn you! You scare me by using mouse. Snakes! Don't use snakes to scare me. Take it away. Help! Take it away! I promise you I'll write the letter. I promise... - It's so quiet. - Yes. - Be quick... - Hurry up... - Loosen his shirt. - Be quick! - Take away the snakes. - Okay. - Be quick. - He has fainted. - Damn it... - Stupid! Make way! Be quick... Brother, please bring 1 million for me in this way, or I will be finished. Don't call the police. Dim Sum... Give me 2 plates. Give me 3 plates. It all sold out! That is for this master. - What's the matter? - You ordered it first. How dare you want to fight with the police! Sir, You first! Come on...Iet's eat. The Dim Sum here is very good. Let's go. We're rich now... We should share it equally. Why is it not proportional? Who gets the smallest share? Guess who! Maybe it's not for me! You know the answer already. We didn't invite you to join us at first. Here is $50,000. Take it and get out or we will share it between ourselves. I'll take it. Snake! $10,000 can buy a flat. Here you can buy 5 flats. It's enough for you. You should feel satisfied. Don't spend the money too quickly or people will be suspicious of us. Just lead a normal life and spend it later! Don't look so rich. Don't buy high class clothes! Okay! Hello! Hold my hat! - This is for you! - Thanks. Darling. - This is for you. - Thanks. - You too! - Thanks. Why do you greet everyone? Do you know them? No, but I am a gentleman! I should be polite. Thanks. Don't pretend anymore. Don't worry about me. Do you know them? Why do you say hello to them? I know him for certain! He is my client. He likes me very much. You dare work at such a dirty thing! I paid off all your debts. You were born as a prostitute! How dare you yell at me? "Ten thousand Buddha Temple" Are you tired? No, there are 600 steps more. The photo is taken on that day. Auntie Jing... - This is The Man Fat Monastery - The Man Fat Monastery. I haven't visited it yet. Delicious. - This is your son's car. - Right. Jing carried me on his back to go up to the top. He is very good to you. Don't be in such a hurry. We'll follow after you've carried your Mum. He is just pretending! If I were you, I would follow. He just scared you! Don't be afraid. It is not easy to lose. - Let take it as $1,000. - He gave out his watch. Open... - What's the matter? - Open. Four with the same number... "She waves her hand at me" "and asks me to go canoeing with her" He sings so good. - Mum, do you feel cold? - No... - Put my clothes on. - Don't... - Tell me if you need it. - Okay. You are pregnant, aren't you? Certainly yes. Lily is pregnant! - Really! - Are you insane? Ah-qiang, stop! Lily is pregnant... - Come on, let's celebrate. - Congratulations... We'll get married. - Cheers... - Congratulations... Come on, cheers... Lily, why do you look so unhappy? - You are insane. - What are you afraid of? Don't drink beer anymore. From now on, I won't drink wine, Mom. - That's good. - Have a soft drink. - What? - You are so disgusting! You'll marry me because of the baby. Which one is more important? She is jealous! Certainly my wife is... more important than my child. Let me kiss you! "You are so nice!" Let's sing! You just follow me step by step. Let's sing again! You'd better employ a maid to take care of your Mom! So your Mom can enjoy her life! I want to find a maid too. Lily, do you have any girl? Okay, let me introduce some girls to you. Keep your promise. What's the matter? "l find a slim lady" "She waves her hands to me..." Why do you stop here? No one appreciates it. What's the matter? Snake has just come with a man called "Devil". He said he know we were the kidnappers. He asks for $100,000 to cover it. Devil and Snake are neighbors. Devil is a drug addict. How can he know it? Maybe Snake and Devil are in league to try and extort us! I think so! He must gamble away all his money. They are too greedy. We should stop them. But I'm afraid if someone knew it. Maybe in a few days the news will spread. Damn it! You forced us to do this! Then either me or them die! Kill them! Are you kidding? We'll become killers one day. Kill them or we'll be finished. Is it feasible? It will be okay! Let's take action. We should do it once more for our family, right? We have no choice but to only go ahead. Let's toss up again. No. They are so cruel and dare kill the hostage. Maybe I am their next target. It's too dangerous... Who? Shit. They cut my electricity. I haven't paid the fee for nearly 3 months. But I am really in need of cash. Why don't I just take the reward of $50,000? It'll be okay. Call the police to arrest them. Snake, come on. Hello, everybody! Why do you come so early for a ride? Can't you fall asleep? You should know why. Right, I've taught. Devil a lesson. I've persuaded him not to ask for so much money. Otherwise he will be finished. He was finished. Right! We've finished him. Brother Huai, you said... I said we've finished him His dead body is lying in the back. We're asking you to help bury him. Ah-jing, let's go. Brother Huai, this hole is big enough. But it is not deep enough. What? Not deep enough? There's just enough space for one dead body. What? Is there not just one dead body? You should know that. What...no kidding with me! You dare plot against us with someone else. You deserved it. He has a knife Don't run... Don't run... Don't... Catch him... Help... Help... Police car. Help... Help, the Wolves want to kill me... - What's the matter? - The Wolves... Sir, there are 3 men who want to rob me So I shouted for help. But why do you shout "The Wolves" only? Sir, I am bleeding. I have a headache. My leg is broken. Let me see the doctor, please! Please! Or I'll die. I can't bear the pains! Snake! Fill in the application form first. And write. I asked Detective Li-cai to let me see the doctor. Thanks. Ah-jiao...open up... Don't be so noisy! Sir, what is your name? Li-cai. How do you write it? It just means money. Is there 3 strokes here? How can you learn it? You are so greedy. One more stroke can make you die! This is a glass of cement water. Now, I invite you to drink it. You'll then get a wonderful feeling in your stomach! No... Snake! After you become our witness and give us the evidence, you won't be sentenced to death. But only be put in jail for 5 years. Are you willing to do so? Don't cheat on me anymore. I have been your wife for so many years. I can tell something is wrong from your face. Why do you always hide it from me? I'm always worried about you. Ah-jiao. Get lost...don't come home again. Or I will beat you. Take care! Come here. From now on, you should listen to Mom. - Dad... - That's okay. Be good to Mom! - Dad...don't leave us. - Be good, bye! Dad, don't leave us...
