l've told you once. l've told you a million times. You'll marry the boy l've chosen. l'll give up my life. But l won't marry anyone who doesn't love me. Love? You've been beguiled by that boy Ramdas. That's why this stubbornness. Did we send you to college to study or to fall in love? lt might be worth considering if Ramdas had money. He has the talent if not money. He stood first in college. So what use is talent? These days, very well educated boys struggle to make ends meet. How will he provide for himself and you if he doesn't have money? This luxury you're so used to, will Ramdas be able to provide it? Priest. Welcome. Priest, you've come at the right time. Convince this stubborn girl. We've arranged her marriage with a boy from a wealthy family... but she just doesn't agree. l know. l overheard your conversation. But l don't want to prove to be a hindrance to love. Not so long ago, l was also a social being. A social animal at that. All of a sudden, something happened that made me give up this world. l vowed to perform service and got admitted to an ashram. No one knows this. Today l'm telling you. This might help you sort this issue out. Far away from here. Very far away. Across the river. ln the lap of mountains. Our small little city was flourishing. Two widows named Heera and Shanti used to live there. Heera had a boy. Jagat. Shanti had a girl. Maya. When Jagat and Maya grew up... l am willing to marry my son to Chandrakant's sister. But l will take a hefty dowry. Right, Shanti. Priest, Jagat is done with his studies. He wants to go to Bombay for further studies. For that, l need money. That's why sister Heera asks for a dowry. Ms. Heera, don't you worry. Mr. Chandrakant won't think twice when it comes to his sister. He has no other family, and lots of wealth. Why doesn't he get married? He wants a damsel. And where do l find one? Have you seen Maya? Maya who? Sister Shanti's daughter. Wait. l'll call her. Maya. Maya. You called me, aunt? Yes. Come and seek the priest's blessings. God bless you, dear. l saw her when she was this small. Wow. She is no less than a Goddess. Lady, do you have any idea what's happening? He's arranging your marriage to Jagat. - Let go, aunt. - Listen up. Bulbul. My Bulbul. Did you hear what aunt just told me? Lady, do you have any idea what's happening? The priest is arranging your marriage to Jagat. But Bulbul... who told mother and aunt that l loved him? You must have told her. No. You must have. l haven't told this to anyone except you. You naughty bird. Okay. l forgive you. Okay. l'll go and fix both marriages right away. That would be so kind of you, sir. With God's grace, l hope both the marriages are finalized. That'll be a huge weight off my back. Obviously. Maya will get married. And Jagat's education will be taken care of. Bhagwan Das has written that Jagat will stay... at his house till the completion of his studies. But how can one live at someone's house for so long? There are more expenses to be borne. College fees, books. This and that. That's what l'm saying. lf we get money as dowry, all our worries will be taken care of. Look, God is great. The priest has said so. Mother, l've got all the information... about the college admission. l must go to Bombay as soon as possible. Or the admissions will end. Stay here for a few days. Your marriage is being arranged. Marriage? So early? Let me finish my studies first. So, is daughter-in-law going to stop you from studying? lf you're lucky and find a nice girl, she'll take you places. And what if l get a bumpkin? Then start teaching her instead of studying yourself. Right. Knowledge increases if you teach and also when you study. No. No. l don't want to get tied down by this bond right now. Will things happen as you wish or as l wish? So, who is she? Who am l getting married to? Wait. Why not tell me right now? How can we tell you before the marriage? How would you know who the girl is even if l told you? So silly of me. Aunts aren't telling you the name of the girl to tease you. l'll tell you. Usha, l pray that you bring prosperity to my son. l'll go through the calendar and fix... the dates for both the weddings. Mr. Chandrakant wants to see Maya. That's why fix the wedding date of... Jagat and Usha'a wedding. No. Let him see Maya first. l want both the marriages to happen together. Fine. l'll come and see her. Hello? Sir, l can't praise Maya's beauty enough. l guarantee you won't find another beautiful girl like her. That's great. Buddhu, get the bottle (of alcohol). Send a message to Sonabai's place... that l'll be coming there this evening to listen to her song. Mr. Chandrakant, ours is a small city. lt doesn't take much for the word to spread. Stop all these things if you want to get your sister... married to Mrs. Heera's son. He can marry my sister only if he needs her badly. There's one more thing. lf Shanti comes to know, it's possible that... she might reject this proposal. So she should keep her daughter with her. You haven't seen her yet. l've counted your petals. l share my feelings with you. Don't forget this. Send this message to him. - To whom? - To whom l said. Send the message. l won't give you the message. You're in bloom today, but you'll wither tomorrow. Give the message to the fragrance. The flower might wither away, but the fragrance will remain. Till when? Tomorrow? No. Forever. First tell me, why do you not obey your mother's wishes? What? Didn't she ask you to marry? Oh. First of all, l don't know to whom l'll be getting married. l know. Really. Tell me. Tell me. Why don't you want to marry before leaving for Bombay? l want to fulfill the objective of my life first. What on earth is your objective? You want to hear? Okay. Sit. l want to study hard. Pass the exam. Make my life successful. And then do something for my country. Jagat Narayan has topped the exams. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. - This calls for some sweets. - Yes. Sure. Sure. l congratulate the defense lawyer, Mr. Jagat Narayan... because you've helped the court arrive at the right decision... with your talent and experience today as well. Respected Mr. Jagat Narayan, you've done your city... a huge favor by starting this college with... your lifelong earnings of Rs. 2,500,000. Now, thanks to your kindness, even the poorest child... in the city will be able to pursue the highest... degree of the university right here. Why, Maya? Didn't you like my dream? - No. - Why? There's no place for me in your dream. Maya, you're not a dream. You're reality. Yes. That's why you don't think about me even in your dreams. And l dream and think only about you. Really? Won't you tell me? Here goes. Okay, tell me. Who makes better food? - Mother or... - Daughter-in-law. Mother isn't here. Daughter-in-law. - Daughter-in-law makes it better. - Yes, right. - Really. So Mohan, who is better? Mother or father? Say it's mother. Mother will get you a toy. Son, l've found a beautiful bride for you. l am really fortunate. l am dying a married woman. l don't like your last dream. Why? You'll go away. And leave me alone. What about you going to Bombay and leaving me? But l'll be back after a few days. Why don't you take me with you? How? Didn't your mother tell you to marry? Yes. How is that connected to your going to Bombay? You just don't understand. Maya. Really? Why didn't mother tell me she wants me to marry you? l would never have refused. Shanti, now what? This spells doom. We had no idea this would happen. We must separate them from each other immediately. Certainly. But how? Jagat wants to go to Bombay. Let him go to Bombay. Yes. And you somehow convince Maya... and get her married to Chandrakant. Then we'll call Jagat from Bombay... - and get him married to Usha. - Good idea. You're here, Jagat. l looked for you all over. What are you doing here, Maya? There are chores to be done. Jagat, you'll waste a year if the college admissions period ends. You should go to Bombay immediately. - Okay. - Go. And write to Mr. Bhagwandas that you're coming. lt's good that Jagat has gone to Bombay... to gain admission to the college. Your marriage will also be finalized by the time he returns. And both the marriages will happen at once. l haven't seen the girl yet. So why discuss the marriage? To be honest, l don't like marriages. l want to be free. Just see her once. And then tell me. Brother, l'll also come with you to see the girl. To see the girl or someone else. Get out of here. lt would've been good for her if she would see. But Jagat has gone to Bombay. The Bombay then and Bombay today are chalk and cheese. When you went with your father, you were this small. l doubt you'd remember anything from that time. l recollect certain things. Yes, uncle Bhagwandas. There was a little girl at your place... who used to get upset with me while playing. Oh. My daughter, Ramla. She wanted to come to the station to welcome you. But she stayed back because of the rehearsal. - Rehearsal? - Yes. Ramla and some of her friends... are going to stage a drama to raise money... for the needy and poor... which includes songs and dances also. Really? Where? At our house. Don't worry. You won't be able to get out of it. Ramla knows that you sing well. And she has a song ready... for you and her to sing. Really? Ramla, we're tired. The dance that we did is nice. Right. Why are you insisting on the dance of the gardener? Be fair. These people haven't seen the gardener's dance. Very well. Anyone? Get some flower pots. The stunning and incomparable... gardener has set out all alone The newly wed and incomparable... gardener has set out all alone She picks off the delicate buds She also plucks flowers from every branch Darn it. l escape the thorns... and only gather the fragrant flowers Forgive the thorn if he has pricked you Let me go. l'm getting late You're the one who's vain. And who has coy eyes and a piercing stare The branch which has blossoming flowers Where are you off to? Let me go deliver the flowers to the market - What are you selling? - Will you buy something? - Yes. - Jasmine, marigold and rose l sell the garlands of Maulsiri (flower) and Oasboondh l don't want Jasmine or Marigold or Gulmohar l want your mesmeric eyes And your embrace You're the admirer of my eyes But your admiration is not genuine This is the garden of flowers and the market of beauty - Go away. - Give me. Give me - What? - Jasmine, Marigold You, the incomparable gardener This is the gardener's dance. - You saw it? Liked it? - Nice. You people have seen both the performances. Now tell me. Which dance should we include in the drama? The first dance is good. What do you say, Mr. Motilal? Yes, l second that. So, the first dance will be in the drama. Okay. lt will be first dance. This will make the drama more interesting. Ramla, look, Jagat Narayan is here. Welcome. Welcome. We've been keenly awaiting your arrival. Mr. Jagat Narayan. About whom l have already told you. Ms. Prabha. Mr. Sharma. Ms. lndira. Mr. Motilal. l've heard a lot about you. l've heard that you sing really well. No, sir. Singing and l are poles apart. He's just being modest. Okay, Ramla., rehearse the song you'll sing with him. No. No. He's tired. Let him rest a little. Come on. Let's go to your room. Prabha, rehearse your song till Mr. Jagat Narayan comes. Very well. l blinked my eyes l lost my senses l forgot my dreams Everyone cheated me This is what l sing l blinked my eyes l halted at the bank of the river Watching the waves coming in l halted at the bank of the river l stood at the bank of the river, deep in thought What? Had l been a river, l would have gushed l would have stood at the river bank and pondered What? Had l been an ocean, you would have merged in me l would have hidden in a mountain l would have flown on the ground l would have got lost in the jungle l wouldn't have come l would have sent the cloud as the messenger As small droplets l would have sent my message Then? l would have fluttered You would have been in a trance l would have swayed You would have shown attitude l would have come running And merged in the ocean Don't lock eyes with me, beloved This is what l sing l blinked my eyes When l go to the river bank, l remember how we used to... play together and sing together When l come home... l see his image in my mind Mother... you tell me... how l can forget Jagat? Take this. l've brought your song. - But l... - Don't fuss like a singer. l'm not fussing. l really don't sing well. So sing badly. Not this song, Prabha. Sing the monsoon song. Yes. lt's the monsoon season. That song will be lovely. Where did Ramla go? She's gone to show Mr. Jagat Narayan the song. Come Beloved, come Get up, beloved Sorrow has passed The dawn of happiness is here Ramla. lt's better that you rehearse this love scene... in the rehearsal room and not here. l know what's good and what's bad. No need to tell me. But you need to be saved from humiliation. You shouldn't forget we're going to be married. Teach me your ways after we're married. Not now. Mr. Motilal, it's my fault. l should have reached the rehearsal room on time. l'll go there. You don't even consider how good Heera has been to us. She gave us shelter and food. She treated us so lovingly. ln return you want to ruin her only son's life? Don't you feel ashamed? Yes. l've chosen the date for the marriage. But why has Shanti still not come with Maya? Maya must be feeling shy to come. l'll bring her. l don't understand anything. We've been waiting for half an hour. And the girl hasn't come. Of course. lf Usha doesn't marry Jagat... Jagat's studies will be discontinued You can't marry Chandrakant. But you can ruin Jagat's life. We will see about the marriage. Dear, at our request Chandrakant has come to see you. He's been waiting for a long time. What will he say? lt's very humiliating. Okay. l will come. Wait. What's the matter? Whoever goes inside doesn't come out. Usha, go and see. Great! How can l go inside uninvited? Tell me, Chandrakant. Glory to God. l will fix the marriage date. l became a recluse for you Beloved, come l have smeared the ash of love on my body Your lovely image dwells in my heart Lovely l will revere you l will venerate you with my eyes l will offer my heart to you Beloved, come Get up, beloved Sorrow has passed The dawn of happiness is here l am smitten Lovely The days of sorrow have passed Now, it's happiness's turn Marvelous! Marvelous! This song will be the best. Stop the rehearsal and eat something. - Jagat sang so well. Fabulous! - Marvelous! - This song will be the best. - Sit. - Sit. - He sang marvelously! Wow! You sang so well! Everyone was praising your dancing and singing. Yes, l'm done with one performance. This one is about to happen. Mr. Motilal. Superb dance. Excellent. l was listening to her song from the other room. - Mr. Sharma, don't feel shy. - Sharma doesn't feel shy. Thanks. - Mr. Jagat. - Thanks. Mr. Jagat Narayan, you won't drink? No. l don't drink. Good. Otherwise you would have surely gotten inebriated. Motilal, there was no need to say that. What decency is this? You're saying l'm not decent? Very well. Under these circumstances, you shouldn't marry me. lt'll be an insult to you. Jagat, you remember the promise you gave me yesterday? Yes. Ramla won't ever want to see my face again. What will you do? You'll find out soon. Don't worry. You're still standing here? Go and change your clothes. - Ours is the third scene. - l'm going. - Won't you buy it? - Surely. Tell me. What do l have to give? Just empty your pockets. That's it? Okay. You've come. How is it possible l wouldn't come to see you? l mean your play? lf l didn't have to prepare for my scene... l would surely watch your dance. - What a dance! - What? Don't pretend. l have heard some Jagat Narayan has come. He sings very well. Yes. lt's said in today's program... his and Ramla's song is the best. Meet Mr. Jagat Narayan. Pleased to meet you. - We came to hear your song. - lt's my fate. What? lf l don't live up to your expectations, you'll abuse me. No. No. The play is about to begin. - Mannu, give me something to drink. - What will you have? - Lemonade? - No. Whiskey and soda. What? Whiskey and soda. Give me cake. Give me one more peg. The twinkle of your eyes The fairy in the bottle lost its splendor Lost its splendor. And is fervent She roams all over the town Why? The bar was proud Somebody took the sparkling drink The twinkle of your eyes The rouge of your cheeks Your mesmerizing eyes My heart is smitten My heart is fervent Why? The garden was proud of it Somebody stole the rouge of the flower The rouge of your cheeks The color of your hands Henna is feeling coy Leaves have withered Gloom has settled over the garden Why? The garden was proud of it Somebody stole the color of henna The color of your hands Now, it will be fun. - Brother Jagat is coming. - When? He didn't given any details about the train. But he's left Bombay. Are you going upstairs? Send Shanti here. Won't you give me a token for Maya's marriage? Yes. Take this. What happened, Heera? Jagat is coming. lf he comes during the marriage, he might create a problem. Wow. Don't worry. - Your turn will also come. - Don't joke. The wedding procession is waiting at the door. Sister-in-law Maya must be waiting for you, all decked up. Jagat doesn't even care for Ramla. But she's missing him a lot. Look, today, we took her to the movies... thinking she would feel better. But she didn't even watch the movie. lt's so strange. A beautiful girl like Ramla also couldn't win Jagat's heart. l think he loves somebody else. Where did Maya go? Mother. Maya has gone to her in-law's house, son. A world of hopes dwelled in my heart Lovely was the breeze A garden of flowers blossomed Then arrived autumn The garden withered All my sweet hopes dashed A world of hopes dwelled in my heart How much farther is it? We're nearly there. Don't you hear the sound of music? - Why is this music played? - lt's Mr. Jagat's wedding. Mr. Jagat's wedding? Stop. Let's go back. Where? To the station? Yes. Stop. ls there any hotel here? There's no hotel here. Then where do travelers stay? The Muslims stay at the inn, the Hindus at the temple. Take me to the temple. Do you know into which family is Mr. Jagat Narayan getting married? lnto Mr. Chandrakant's family. Mannu. Mannu. Yes, sir? When will dinner be served? l'm waiting for Ms. Ramla. Where has Ramla gone? l don't know, sir. She didn't turn up for lunch, either. - Did she refuse to have lunch? - No. What is this nonsense? She never does this. Go and check whether her car is parked in the garage. - Are you Hindu? - Yes. Are you married or single? From where have you come? What business do you have here? You should have stopped somewhere else. How will you feel comfortable in a temple? Why are you concerned about it? l'm Hindu. l have the right to stop here. Okay, let her stay here. Hello, lndira? Has Ramla come there? No? She decided to catch a movie? At Prabha's place? All right. l'll call her. Hello? Hello? Prabha? Yes. l wanted to inquire from you. She didn't come there? Then where has she gone? Sir, Ms. Ramla's car is parked in the garage. The driver's been waiting for her for a long time. - Why? - He says Ms. Ramla told him this morning... she'd go and watch a movie... with Prabha and lndira in the evening. He should be ready. What is this dilemma? Where has Ramla gone? She never goes out without saying. - Mannu. - Yes, sir? Get the car ready. l'll go and look for her myself. Let me look at Jagat to my heart's content once. That's it. Can you guide me to Mr. Chandrakant's house... where the wedding is taking place? lt's at some distance. Go straight. You saw? What did l tell you? That girl is missing. That young woman has gone out at night for an outing. lt's not a good sign. To hell with it! l am telling you. She will defame our temple. She's an indecent woman. The dropping of the veneration plate is a bad omen. Oh, Lord, please save Jagat. Why did the veneration plate slip from my hands? l hope no inauspicious thing occurs. Oh, Lord, don't let any trouble befall Jagat. So Jagat's wedding got solemnized by the grace of God. Priest, it got solemnized but the dropping of the veneration plate... isn't a good omen. l'll find its solution on some auspicious date. But l'm worried about Maya. Why? What's wrong? Mr. Chandrakant was complaining... that she doesn't even speak to him. She runs away as soon she spots him. Mr. Chandrakant has a hot temper. l wonder what he might do. No. He hasn't come yet. l don't know when he'll return. Thank God. Motilal hasn't returned yet. lf he was here right now, he would have wreaked havoc. Yes. He's very cruel. We should find Ramla before he returns. l repeat, send a telegram to Jagat. Here. l've written it, too. Give it to me. But l'm sure that Ramla will never go to Jagat... after that day's incident. Then where has he gone? You searched for her high and low last night. Wouldn't you have found her if she was in Bombay? ls Bombay a small city? Come on, let's go and check again. Mr. Bhagwandas had called up to inquire when you'd return. l told him l didn't know. Hello? ls Mr. Bhagwandas at home? Oh, Mr. Motilal has returned. Now? Yes, sir? No. Where has he gone? Yes? And Ms. Ramla? Pardon? What? Sir, she too... she has gone somewhere, too. l don't know. lnform them after they return that l have reached... and will come to meet them. lt's very bad. What should l do? How should l inform sir? l wonder where he must be. lf Jagat misbehaves with Usha as Maya misbehaves with me... l'll never let Usha go to his place. l agree about Maya. But why are you saying this about Jagat? l'm saying so because his face was downtrodden throughout the wedding. Didn't you see how disappointed he looked... while taking the wedding vows? And Usha was looking so oppressed. None of them were happy. l'll speak to Jagat's mother about this. l've instructed Maya's mother about her. - She'll explain to him. - She'll never understand. l wonder at which inauspicious moment you had fixed these weddings. Our lives will definitely be ruined. She's not there, either. ls Ms. Prabha there? No? ls Ms. lndira at home? No? lf Mr. Bhagwandas comes there then inform him... that Mr. Motilal has returned. - Mannu, has he returned? - No, sir. - When will he return? - l don't know sir. All right, l'll wait for him. This is Ramla's handwriting. Mannu. Mannu. Yes, sir? ls Ramla in Bombay? Yes, sir. She's about to return. Liar. Traitor. Betrayer. You're trying to deceive me? Ramla has gone to Jagat. To Jagat. So Ramla has gone to Jagat. Wait. l'll teach a good lesson to the both of them. Mannu, did you call up and inform that Motilal has returned? Yes, madam. He was here just now. He's responsible for my miserable plight. Why? Sir, l said that Ms. Ramla is in Bombay, so... So what? He immediately called me a traitor, liar and cheat... and thrashed me. - Why? - He said that Ramla isn't in Bombay. She's gone to meet Jagat. - What are you saying? - Yes, sir. How did he come to know? - Through the letter. - What letter? Why didn't you tell us? Wait. Don't panic, Mannu. - Whose letter was it? - l don't know, sir. How did he get it? All the letters were placed here. He must have picked it up from them. lt may have been Ramla's letter addressed to you. Sir, the car is ready. Sir, what should l say if anyone asks when you'll return? Say you don't know. l've left town. What right did he have to read your letter? l wonder what else is written in it. Why are you so scared of Mr. Motilal? l'll call him right away and get all the information. Hello? Hello? ls Mr. Motilal at home? No. He's gone out. l don't know where. Yes. By train. Where must Motilal have gone? He must have gone after Jagat and Ramla. Then they are done for! - Then... - Come on, let's go. A telegram? lt's from Jagat. Ramla hasn't reached there. Then where has she gone? Yes. Go this way. You'll come across a verandah ahead... where you'll find a door. That's Mr. Jagat Narayan's room. Usha, no one has control over anyone's heart. l am helpless. l can't love you. Then why did you marry me? What could l have done? My mother had already promised your brother. Usha. Usha, please forgive me. l love someone else. Someone else? Why don't you say that you love Ramla? Wait. l'll kill both you and Ramla. Why are you bothered whether l stay here at night or go out? Why not? lf you will stay here, you'll have to be decent. Don't talk nonsense. l'm a decent woman. Don't have that misunderstanding, madam. l can guess your intentions. A young girl has left her home alone. Does it mean l'm indecent? You may be pious but are not worthy of staying at a temple. l will definitely find out the truth today. Tell me. Why try and avoid me? Tell me. Speak up. Why argue with her? Take her and drive her out. Come on, get out. But still...but still you're my husband. l am your wife. We will be together all our lives. How will we manage like this? My heart has been worshipping him since childhood. God is aware how much effort l've made. l controlled my heart. But l was unable to forget him. l couldn't forget him. So you don't have any place in your heart for this unfortunate girl? ls this your justice? ls this your duty? Usha, l know it's a sin to give your place to anyone else. But ... l am helpless. God knows l tried my level best but l couldn't forget her. l couldn't forget her. l will always be yours by deeds and duty. But l don't have any control on my heart. lf you can't forget her, you deserve to be with her and not me. You won't get anything but misery with me. You go to her. Then you won't have any relations with me and my family. You don't have any place for me in your heart. You hate the mere sight of my face. Please don't stay with me. Go to her. Go. Go. You belong to Jagat, so go to him. Come on. Get out. Sir is completely drunk. He's driven madam from the house. Come on, let's bring madam back home. Once he's rid of the hangover, he'll regain his composure. Since childhood l have worshipped him. God is the witness. l tried very hard to control my feelings. But l couldn't forget him. l couldn't forget him. How can Maya forget Jagat? How can she forget him? Maya. Maya. Maya. Usha, l know. lt's a sin to love anyone besides you. But l am helpless. God is the witness. l tried very hard. But l couldn't forget her. l couldn't forget her. lt's not his fault. He can't forget Maya. Forgive me. Where did you go? We've been searching for her for a long time. Let's go and see. Maya! Maya! They went out. l don't know where they might be in this storm. Come on. Let's search for them. Maya! Maya! Jagat! Jagat! You go there. You go here. l'll go this way. Now, you know... why l don't want to create hurdles in love. Dear, you'll marry the man you love.
