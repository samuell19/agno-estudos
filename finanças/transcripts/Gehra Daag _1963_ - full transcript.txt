How do you recognize him, sister? He was very young at that time. But now she has completely changed. - Come in. - Okay. We will bring this. Brother, sit down. Sit down too. Asha, sit down too. Brother, your hands are rough because of me, aren't they? These hands have paid back that burden. Now, everything is fine in life. You have lovely children. Your full, this house makes me very proud. I really miss you. Uncle, this is very heavy. What's in this? There's a lot in this for you kids. Give it to me - Shall I open this? - Okay. - These toys and clothes are for you. - They are beautiful. This is for you, Munni. Sister, this is for you. How were these chosen? I don't know anything. I told the shopkeeper... ...to give clothes in the fashion of this time. This is for my cousin. - Whose brother is this shawl? - This is for me, Munni. - This is a women's shawl. - Yes, this was given to me by a mother. - What mother? - She was on the boat I was on. Suddenly she fell into the water. I saved her life. Now she treats me like her son. - Sons! - Father has arrived. Daddy, uncle is here. He brought us lots of toys. Yes, nice toys. - He is my brother Shankar. - The children told me. - When did you come? - just now. If you have informed, we will come to meet you at the station. I also did not know that I would come so soon. Come on, sit down. - Sit down. - You sit down. - I will sit down. - How did you come? - By ship. is it? It takes a long time to come from Africa. Change your clothes. Let's relax and talk - OK, I'll bring a dress too. - We are coming too. Asha go and make tea. - Sister, what is this Africa? - I told him so. I couldn't tell him that you went to jail. - But why? - To hide a scar in my life. I didn't understand. I didn't understand one thing. Why did you leave this country and go to America? - My fate led me there. - is it? Aren't the people of Africa rich? But I had to work hard because I was poor. Even though I am poor, since the day your sister came into my life... ...My fate has been lucky. But I have a complaint against you. Even though you have been abroad for so long, you have not looked for us. You did not write any letter to your sister. - I am sorry. - Okay. - Tea is ready. - We are coming. Come on. You have come at the right time. Now Asha's age is right. We often think about her marriage now. There is a groom. We will conduct her marriage very soon. drink tea Sister! - What you did was wrong. - I know, brother. But sometimes we have to lie to survive. - You say that... - Yes, brother. After you went to jail, how much evil did the world do to me. Everywhere he looked, he saw only hatred. People called me the killer's sister. After hearing that I got sick and finally had to leave everything. My college, our house and even the city. When I came to this city, there was no food to give to Asha. My husband took pity on us and accepted us. After many questions I got support. Therefore, I was afraid that if I told the truth, I would lose that support. Brother, I know that I am committing a great sin by lying like this. Forgive me for these sins, brother. What if these tears are called pearls, sister? Although the tears in the eyes are visible to the world. No one can see the storm in my heart. Ok, sister. But if the brother-in-law finds out. What does he think of you? No one will know. - Did you two come back? - No, we're not going. I try to go with them but they keep coming back here. They say they want to sleep next to uncle. - Why this, children? - No, we want to sleep with uncle. - Uncle is very tired, let him rest. - No, we want to sleep with uncle. - Come now. Don't be stubborn. - No, we will sleep with uncle Let them stay here sister. Come on kids. Brother, they will trouble. You will not be allowed to sleep. These innocent children are the ones who can make me happy. - Okay, don't bother your uncle. - No, we won't bother him. You go sister. Come let's sleep. Tinku, you sleep there, Chinku will sleep here. - Here! - Uncle will sleep in the middle. is it right? - it's OK. Let's sleep now. Come, my dear child. - Uncle, don't let him sleep next to you. - Why is that? He will urinate the bed at night. Uncle, he does that and scolds me. He is very naughty children, both of them are not urinating in bed today. Don't blame anyone, okay. - Uncle is very cold. - I will give you a blanket. Uncle... Uncle...! I will pretend to be asleep. Don't tell them. Uncle! Come on, uncle is sleeping. Don't bother him. Uncle is not well. - Uncle is not well. - Yes, very difficult. - Shall I see? - Come on. Munni, where did these two bullies go? Brother, I have a feeling these two are going to do something. - Naughty! - Brother, they are coming. - Come on doctor. He is not well. - I will see. I will see. Everything is fine. His heart beats fast. How is the doctor, how is he? Only high fever. You have to give injections. You may be scared, don't be scared! Everything will be fine. Why is he being told to be afraid? Say don't be afraid. - Shut up! He is not well. - Sorry, doctor. He can see. - This eye will not open. - We must treat then. Yes, that's right. Children, will you blind your uncle? Uncle's eyes were opened! Uncle, are your eyes open? - Thank God, it was opened by fate. - Or he went to treatment. - We are hungry. - I feel hungry too. We came to talk to you, uncle. Mom told you to come. - Then it's too late. - She will be angry. Let's go. Leaving all this here, let's go. - Father has come. - Did you come? Come because the food is ready. I will take off my coat. What did the groom's people say? I answered their questions. Why, did something special happen? That boy's uncle went to jail. We are lucky to have survived. Otherwise, it is destructive. - I immediately refused that feast. - Yes... - But what is wrong with the groom? - Are you crazy? Although she is your sister, I treat her as one of mine. I can't push her into a well on purpose. Such things are in their blood. - Isn't that right, Shankar? - Yes. why don't you eat Don't worry because I have another chosen groom in mind. He is also good. I will talk to them soon. - Eat your food without fear. - Yes, I will eat. Usha. Where are you going? why don't you eat "The groom's uncle is serving time in jail" "Such things are in their blood" do you want to die Shankar... Son Shankar. We are glad to meet you.

You didn't say anything either. I was just thinking about you. What were you thinking? You are a very good person. I can be a bad person too. My past... Like other people in the world, you think about the past. I never think about the past. I always feel like the past is dead. But Shobha, you should at least know who I am. - I know everything. - What do you know? You gave the shawl you had to a poor, cold person. If you had not been there that day, my mother would not have been saved. If there is anything else in your past... ...don't need to know about it. But Shobha. I want to tell you. Maybe I'm not good enough for you. Shankar, I saw you in the face of Lord Shankar. But you have not seen the poisonous snake around his neck.

Mr. Lawyer, please explain to him You come with me. Mr. Shankar, do you recognize me? You don't know me but I know you very well. You killed a young man, didn't you? A murder! Was it not punished for 14 years? Mr. Shankar look at me carefully. I am the lawyer who sentenced you to 14 years. Shankar, is he telling the truth? Why not answer? Such a big scam. Mr. Ramesh, you spoke a lot of big things. You seem like a decent man but this kind of work… It is good that we got to know about your family in time. Otherwise, our honor would have been mixed with ashes. - This marriage is impossible - Yes, it is impossible. Usha, is it true that your brother was killed? The bride's brother is a murderer. He has been in prison for 14 years. If the lawyer didn't recognize him... ...it would be a disaster. He is very innocent. But what will happen to that girl now? Who will marry her now? Your uncle is a murderer. Come on son. We cannot ally ourselves with the sister of a murderer. - Come on, everyone. - No, please don't do this. I beg you, Lalaji! Please don't do this for God's sake. I committed a crime and was punished for it. I was in jail for ten years... ...for my crime. I thought my scars were washed away. If you all still think I am a sinner, punish me more. You take my life away. But please don't play with my sister's life, Lalaji. She has no experience in life. She is very innocent. I promise you after this marriage. I'm leaving here forever. I will never show my face again. Please don't break this alliance, Lalaji. Go away, I told you before that the marriage will not happen. What are you talking about with a murderer's sister? - Yes, it won't happen. - You leave. We have already said that it will not happen. I don't want to hear anything. The peace you had here. You will never find anywhere else. Why did you deceive me like this? How did I hurt you? Have I received you to be disgraced before the world? Aren't you ashamed to deceive me so much? You have turned your husband's reputation into ashes. A necklace made of fake pearls and worn around the neck. It has become my death knell. How did I think of you? I never thought. That your brother will be a snake like this... ...in my dreams. Why are you silent? Why don't you answer me? do not! If he is your brother, before he ruins his life. Innocent sisters, he should have died. He must die. Yes Shankar, everyone's welfare is in your death. Must die. brother I'm sorry sister. I am a very unfortunate brother. I wanted to do everything but I couldn't. Don't cry sister. Everything will be fine. No one will call you the sister of a murderer again. Your marriage will not end. Your marriage will never stop again. Damn it happened... ...It hurt him. As much as the world hurt him. It became a very bad stain. God, for what crime did I get such a big punishment? If this is your world, I will go away from this world. God, for what crime did I get such a big punishment? If this is your world, I will go away from this world. The demons of this world created this storm. Because of this storm... ...When all the lights go out, I wait. If this is your world, I will go away from this world. God, for what crime did I get such a big punishment? If this is your world, I will go away from this world. I thought that my stain was washed away. As my stains are washed away… ...I didn't know my heart was going to break even more. If this is your world, I will go away from this world. God, for what crime did I get such a big punishment? If this is your world, I will go away from this world. There is no one else in this world as unfortunate as me. The person I met said I was a sinner. If this is your world, I will go away from this world. God, for what crime did I get such a big punishment? If this is your world, I will go away from this world. Shankar, what did you do? Are you crazy? - Let me die Shobha. - Why is that? My sisters lives have been ruined because of me. Do you think you can bring happiness to your sisters by dying? No. Demons are still in this world even after you die. They come to torture and harass them more. Even if you want to die because of these people... ... you are already dead. They do not see the pure soul that is hidden in you. Those demons see rocks and not the diamonds inside. Shankar, if you die like a coward today, these people... ...people like this kill thousands. Yes. Shankar. Don't give them another chance. - But what am I doing and where am I going? - Come with me. We will go to great lengths to make your past life invisible to anyone. People see your pure soul and not the stain of life - Shobha, even after you know all this... - Yes, Shankar. I used to love you but now I worship you. Shankar, when you have no one, God is with you. Come on Shankar. just smile. I will open the door, brother, wait. Good to see you, Shobha. You too... Shankar sir. - Did you two come alone? - No, with a suitcase and bags. Now go get them, come on! Mother! Shobha then you have come. God bless you too Shankar. You came then. Long live you Shankar. I missed you... ...while praying, Shobha. God bless you! Come on. - are you fine? - Yes, fine. You did a good thing by bringing him here, daughter. He was not ready to come, I forced him. Why didn't you want to meet your mother? Who else do I have in this world but you? Everyone at home is fine, is your sister alright? Everyone is fine mom. He is very tired, let him rest a little. ok son You go and change your clothes. I will prepare food for you. Hey Sundar! Shankar come. I'll show you to your room. Brother... Brother! - Usha. -Mother. - What is this madness Usha? I am begging you. I don't want anything from you. My brother sacrificed everything for me. He spent 10 years in prison and was publicly humiliated. Wouldn't you do that if you had a girlfriend? My brother sacrificed himself for me. How will I face the world if something happens to him? How do I answer God? So no sister will tie a rakhi to her brother. A brother does not protect his sister when he is in trouble. He came to my house as a guest. My guest left. If he is not alive, I will not be alive. I am also leaving my life. I'm dying too. Dad, what happened to mom? Take the Asha children inside. Mother... Mother! Sister! I was worried about what would happen to you after I went to jail. Married you after knowing that you are like a god. I was not very sorry for the punishment given to me in prison. This punishment was a big stain in my life. But nothing is more important to me than my sister. My wish is that my life... ...to join the life of the brother-in-law. If these prison walls didn't stop me... ...I come to fall at the feet of that godly man. I feel very blessed to know this today. I have now got sons like Sanda. Brother, I feel so happy to know that you are being protected. In serving you. How good is he? He is really like a god sister. This distant uncle blesses your children. Brother, I made a big mistake. No. Usha. I was wrong. Please forgive me. Son, are you up? Shankar, your name is one. Even if I say your name, I will be blessed. Take this favor, son. Take this. God bless. - Shobha, take this favor. - No, after my worship. - The pilgrimage is over. - I must worship my God. I didn't understand. - Enough mom. - Take another one, son. - No, I already ate too much. - You eat less. I got a lot of food. - Why is this, son? - This... The servants have them, son Go wash your hands. Come, sit down son. I have something to talk about. Bring some betel nut, daughter. Mom, there is no betel nut at home today. They are in the upstairs room, go. Where are you, mother? You go and see first. You can see it only if you look for it. - Go. - Okay, mom. son Shobha is the only help in my life. I always thought... ...about Shobha's future. There was fear about it. But from the time I saw you, my son, all my worries went away. Son, will you accept Shobhava and become my son? But I... Answer me son. - Your wish, mom. - My son. - Sunder. - Shobha is getting married. - Yes, with Shankar. - Shall I call them, madam? - Who is that? - To the house we went to that day. - I will not call my sister?

We won't part because we got love. After receiving you, I have received the whole world. I have received not only this earth but also the sky. When we saw, the rain was very heavy. This rain seems to rain only for today. - You are completely wet. - You are also wet. come inside why are you out Shankar... you. - Jailer Sir, you here... - This is my house, Shankar. I am here after retirement. How did you get here? - We came to escape the rain. - Okay, then come in. I never expected. I will meet you. But see how nature meets people. sit down who is she?

That God is with me in this world. - He has come into my life like a god, sir jailer. - is it? - Are you married? - No, it will happen. - What is your name, daughter? - Beauty. - Beauty! Daughter, you have chosen a diamond among the stones. Mr. Jailer, God knows where I'd be if she hadn't been. Because of the evil in this world... ...Maybe I'm not alive. She has given me a lot of support. I had faith that God will surely help you in your sorrow. I saw an important soul in you. I saw the sun behind the clouds, and I completely believed. That this sun will break out of the clouds and shine. You are right, sir. I also saw many glimpses of his good spirit. If it wasn't for him, I would have lost my mother. Both of you are compatible. I wish you both to be happy always. - Bring it quickly Ramu. - Rajan. - Yes, father. - He is my son, Rajan! He is Shankar. - Bring it, Ramu. - Let us go now. - But daughter, it's raining. It hasn't stopped yet. how are you going Mother will be very upset if we don't go. Yes, Mr. Jailer. We must leave now. Okay, I can't stop you now. You take my umbrella. - Son Rajan, bring my umbrella. - Okay, dad. - Why are you tired? - Both of you come back. We will definitely come. Come to our house. - Come with brother Rajan. - Okay. - Where is your house? - Our house is very close. At the end of this street is the yellow bungalow. Is that yellow bungalow yours? - I pass by there every morning during my walk. - Okay. I will definitely come. But take this umbrella Please sit down. Why are you so tired? Until you leave. Have you not slept yet? I can't sleep, and you... I am used to being awake. I have that habit too. since when Since then, this rain has come. - The wind is very strong. - Maybe a storm will come. Mom... what happened mom? The windows of the upstairs room are open. As they were about to close, I slipped. - Are you hurt? - No, don't worry. - Run and close the windows. - Okay, mom I will go and close them, Shobha. You take mom inside. - God bless you son. Look at that room. - Okay mom. - Does it hurt, mom? - No, daughter. You are trying to work. Why not tell us? Nothing happened, daughter. This is my brother's photo. When he was young, someone killed him in college. But till today I was not told about him. What is the use of mentioning him? Those who leave will not return. And you know I never remember past events. Come on. come now - What Shankar, sick? - Yes. It took you a long time, son. - Mom was looking at his brother's photo. - The photo! yes son Only the photo of my beloved son remains now. That devil took away everything else. He studies well when I go on my pilgrimage. - But when he came back, there was nothing left except this photo. - Mother! I was so unfortunate that I could not even see his face. How many times have I told you not to remember past events. - Forget them. - How can I forget them, daughter? - I am his mother. - Enough now! How can you forget, daughter? I am his mother. Shankar, run away from here before they find out. You run away from here. run away. Are you a coward and running away from the truth? Don't sneak out, shame on you. So what do I do? Shankar, love and truth always wins. When you have no one, God is with you. Son, Shankar. You got up early today. Get this bonus now. No, mom. I am not your son. - What are you saying son? - I'm telling the truth. I don't want to deceive you, mother. - I am not your son, but your son's murderer. - what? yes mom The photo of your son that you garland every day. He was killed by these hands. So, you're the one who ruined my world. You took the light out of my eyes. You have taken away the support of my old age and left me destitute. You took my son away when he was young. Sinful murder, didn't the hand tremble at that time? Didn't you think he could have a widowed mother? Didn't you think that he might have an innocent sister? - Get out of my sight. - Mom! Daughter! He is the murderer who took my son from me. He is not a man but a demon. First he took my son. Now he needs to change his form… ...take my daughter away from me. Tell him to go. leave my house Mr. Jailer, it is good to meet you today. I have one last request for you. Never tell anyone that love and truth will always win. Never reduce the sentence of any prisoner again. If you really sympathize with someone, you recommend… ...only death sentence for him. Then he dies only once. A man cannot die a thousand times. Mom save him or he will kill himself. He could have hidden everything if he wanted to. But he didn't. He has already faced… ...the greatest punishment for his crime. Do not give him the death penalty. He has saved your life too mom. If anything happens to him today, we should be responsible... ...for his death. And then God will never forgive us. Daughter! - Jailer sir. - You are right daughter. Sister, Shankar has already faced his full punishment. I saw his spirit improve. His ten year seal. Forgive him, sister. If he had not been forgiven today, Shankar would have regretted his sins. Shankar's soul will not be sacred. You are a goddess. A woman can only give life, she cannot take life. Get up sister. By forgiving Shankar... ...You are working to make the entire women's society more sacred. Do such thing that women are always worshipped. Go daughter. Before Shankar perished... ...from the hatred of the world, go and save him. Wait a minute ma'am. Don't leave me Shankar. I love you. Wait, wait, son. look at me I have already lost a son. I don't want to lose my second son. Come on son. Come to me son. Take this mother's shawl. Don't worry Shankar. Your sister is marrying my son. Love has great power. The lights that have gone out also start to light up. People of the world. Please keep the deep thing of love in your heart. This is a popular Hindi movie released in the year 1963.
