Stop, stop, what is the matter with you? Not my jacket! Take your stupid jacket, that's all you care about anyway! I don't even know why I put with you. Why you put up with me? What about you? Go then, huh? Go home with her! Nah, nah, nah, nah. You wanted him so bad? You keep him! Celina, stop! Can we talk, please? Oh, what should we talk about first? The fact that this woman has drawers full of your underwear, or that you weren't at home watching Christian? It's not his fault you let yourself get pregnant. America, English, speak English! This is America, and we speak English now. But before the British even showed up in the scene, Native Americans had over 300 different dialects. In fact, the American accent is made up by multiple cultures struggling to speak British English. If you didn't know this, I didn't either. I mean, not many of us do. As Americans, we're not great at history. How many films about the 60s and 70s have you seen that aren't just about me? While we all had Saturday Night Fever, there were communities of Americans, especially women, that were fighting to be treated like, well, Americans, and guess what? They won. And guess what? We're losing. So allow us to take you back to the beginning to show you how far we've come. But your gonna have to forgive us for being, well, resourceful. And for not being able to afford to dress the street. Where can a girl get some affordable childcare over here, huh? Cash only, sweetheart. Okay. You can take him. If you can forgive us for the fact that we don't have the best lighting. Can I get a little fill down here? We'll tell you a story about making due with what you've got. About stretching a penny as long as a track. Pulling yourself up by the bootstraps when all you have left is your skin. 'Cause if you were living in that America, we bet that you'd be throwing things out the window too. High school, 1967. Old people have sex faster than this. How do you even like this stuff, it's so boring. I don't know, it just makes sense. What would make sense is you coming tonight. I can't. You're really gonna miss your man's welcome home party? Shh, he's not my man. Someone should tell him that. Are you talking about Mateo Valencia? Oh, you're so lucky, Cel. Older guys are the best. They're so worldly, not like these little boys around here that don't know where to put their pingas. That's what I'm saying! Even if he was medically discharged, it probably all still works. Can't you see that some of us are trying to study? Don't worry, Yvette, no one was inviting you. Well, not everyone cares about boys' pingas. This is a plane, actually. And I was gonna ask Mateo what it was like in Europe. Asia. Because I want to be a pilot one day, and I might want to go there. First of all, girls can't be pilot. And second of all, you might want to wait until the end of the war. Yeah, you would know that if you did anything other than your makeup. Shut up, Yvette. Ladies! Come on. Even pilots have to do math. Look, it's easy if you follow the rules. It's a straight line from A to B. Every time. It's fair. Can I just copy you? It's gonna save time. What's wrong? You're too good for my food? No. Then? I have a question. Marty asked me if I can go to Mateo's welcome home party. He's back? What a nice life you give your daughter. Private school, parties. While I bust my ass working so late so she can live the good life. Does that seem okay? So what? You're going to go out at night like a whore? No, mama. No, it's fine. Go and slut around like your Mom did in her day. And look how well that went. Juan, that's enough. What? Juan. This is my house, and I'll say as I please. You go study. No, no, no, no! Go to your room, Celina. I said go to your room! Seriously, what would you do? Finally! I've been holding back the hounds. Good morning, Vietnam. Don't be nervous. I'm not nervous. There's nothing to be nervous about. Why are you nervous? I'm not nervous, he's just a guy. Hello. Would you like some cake? Oh, yeah, cake. I love cake, I'm gonna get cake. Welcome home. Thank you for coming. You look okay. Just okay? I mean, you didn't lose a leg, an arm. I mean... Did you miss me? Yeah. A lot. I missed you too. Do you want to dance with me? I need to pee. Marty, I need you. I didn't have my cake! An arm? Why don't you just set off a firecracker next to him? I'm serious, Marty. Okay, this whole time he's been gone he's all I've thought about. I think I'm in love. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, no. You did not tell him that, did you? No. Good, good. You have to play hard to get, keep him on his toes. Otherwise, he'll step all over you, and I will not let you get stepped on. Okay, but... What if he loves me too? Then he won't let you get away. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. I mean, look at me and Carlos. He practically begs me for it. Look at me and Marty. Hm? She does what I say, when I say it. Okay. You want to get her attention? Ignore her. I don't want to ignore her, man. I just got back, you know? The less interested you come across, the more you'll have her going wet for you, man. Okay, I'm gonna go talk to her. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Man up! I'm not gonna be around to keep you from getting your heart broken this time, man. I'm serious. Listen to me. You've already tried to chivalry thing. Where did that get you? Blue balls all the way to China. Okay, scratch that. Treat her like shit and you'll have her with her legs wide open until the sun comes up. Yeah? Come on. It's not like you're out of options anyway, hm? I'm sorry I ran out on you like that before. I, um... I'm ready to dance now. Oh, um... On the next one, yeah? Excuse me? What are you doing? Having a good time. You should too. Oh, oh, I will, I will. What did you do? No, what did you do? I told him to man up. Psh. What are you doing? Fixing this. Okay. Girls over here, boys over there. We're gonna do a little dance. Hey! Switch! Go. Oh, god. Excuse me! Okay, make a little room, come on, guys. I'm gonna give you a little something. Ready? Yeah, Carlos, come on, baby! Yeah, all right! I just love it up here. Don't you? Mm. Are you happy to be back? Can I be honest with you? No. Hey, no, no, no, no. It has nothing to do with you. You're the only thing that's making this bearable. I understand. You want to be with your men. Yeah, you know, I should be with my men. I should be doing a lot of things. Come on, I've waited a long time. You know, I want to be your first, you don't want me to be your first? I do, you know I do. Okay, then what are we waiting for? We love each other, right? Yes. Then what? Then... Then? Let it out. Oh god. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. The pill? Oh, I can only prescribe those to married couples. Does your mother know you're here? What do you want that for? I didn't raise a whore. Keep your legs closed. Sex is a sin, lust is a sin. The female body is a weak, dirty, and sinful thing. Let us pray. Don't worry, nothing happens the first time. Nothing happens the first time? God, they'll say whatever it takes. "Don't worry, I'll pull out, it's fine." What's that mean? He didn't say that. Mateo didn't... But Carlos did. What? I thought we were being careful. He said it would work! God, I'm so stupid. It's that damn uniform. How long since... Two months, maybe three. What are we gonna do? We're not gonna let this ruin our life. Carlos knows a doctor who can help. Hey, you know what? - Let's get married. - What? Yeah. Right, I'm back. I didn't want to be back, but I'm back. Okay, maybe the injury, maybe me leaving the company, all that was supposed to happen. I can take care of you, all of us. Right? How many teeth are we extracting? 2. Teeth. Okay. I'm writing your prescription nerve blocker for the pain. You take two the night before. And bring cash, use the back entrance. You understand? Mhm, yeah. Hey. You tell Carlos this is the last time I help him with one of his girls. Mhm? I'll tell him. Stop, please. I can't. I'm freaking out, I don't think we should do this, it's not safe. He's a dentist. He takes things out of people all the time. Mouths. He takes things out of their mouths. Same thing. It's not funny. We took the medicine, we'll be fine. Come on, you really want to have a baby right now? We're gonna get through this, and you're gonna go off and be some math prodigy person and have a big house with a white picket fence. Because you're the smartest person I know, and you're not gonna waste that. And you're gonna be a pilot, and you're gonna see the world. Damn right. There's gotta be more than this. Maybe not Asia. How about Europe? So, who's first? I'll go. Maybe you're thinking this is an easy way out, but there's nothing easy about this. I'm never gonna be able to talk to anybody about it. I'm gonna spend the rest of my life pretending like it never happened. Sure, I got myself here, I made the decision to have sex. I'm the sinner. I made a bad choice, and I should live with the consequences. But did I really just make a bad choice, or was I just not given the safety to make an informed one? The catch-22 is enough to make you scream on the inside. Oh my god, oh my god. I told you to stay still! Marty? Help! Marty? Open the door! Hey, open the door! Call an ambulance! Marty, Marty, open the door! Cel? Hey. I tried to get in. I tried to get out. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. No, no, no, no. Don't. Did my mom come? Good. One more thing to haunt her for. Hey, hey. Don't talk like that, okay? You're not dying. Okay, they're gonna fix you up. Don't lie, Cel. It doesn't look good on you. Don't talk so much, it doesn't look good on you. Bitch, everything looks good on me. Hey. Don't ever tell him I was sorry. When they ask, I'm not. Looks like you're gonna make all the decisions now. Do all the things you want, Cel. Promise me. Don't talk like this. Cel. Do you think God will forgive me? There is nothing to forgive. Nothing. Okay? Uh, miss? I'm told you're next of kin. Would you be able to confirm a few details? Her name was Martina Guzman? Age? 17. Cause of death? Murder. 1969. Yeah, can you clarify this with them? Because this doesn't- - I will, I know. I have a call out to Ingrid, and I haven't heard back yet. Celina? Minerva. You may take your lunch break now. Is there anything else I might do? No. Let's get her on the phone together maybe? Mom, what's wrong? The baby is sick. You need to take care of him. You said you'd watch him. I need to take care of your father. You need to come home now. He's been crying all day, I don't know what's wrong. Mom, I can't leave. If I leave, I'll lose my job. That's your problem. Who told you to have a kid? Maybe his stomach hurts, I don't know. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You need to buy more milk. I just bought some. We drink a lot of milk in this house. What do you want me to do? Did you tell her? Tell me what? That you have to pay more rent. What, why? Did they raise it? No. So then? So then? So then, the problem is... That your Mom and I think that it's not fair that you only pay half of the rent, meanwhile she takes care of your kid. And the utilities, the food? Did you forget I pay those too? Don't get fresh. A babysitter would cost you much more. And why should we have to solve your mess? We're doing you a favor. I don't have enough. Mom, I don't have enough, I really don't. Please. Wherever you go, you have to pay rent. Why don't you take the baby to bed? Don't worry, papito. We're gonna be okay. I promise. Did you enjoy your nap? You're smart to save money. There's not a lot of girls doing that these days. Most of them spend it on magazines and makeup. That's every day sexism. He's being nice, so I'm gonna give him a pass. Can I ask what you're saving for? A wedding, maybe? See? That, or something like that. I have another job too. You're gonna need a third. Have you ever considered applying for a job as a teller? I mean, you're a fast learner, and tellers make a great deal more than typists do. I have, but you need a diploma. Ah, I see. Thank you for lunch, Mr. Li. Gilbert. Gilbert. Come with me, please. Bring your things. What? Minerva, I am so sorry. I will not make any more mistakes. I really need this job. Come on. Seems Mr. Li thinks you have some potential. I don't understand. Oh, trust me, neither do I. If you any questions, Gertie will help you. You'll want to thank him. Be careful. Mr. Li? Mr. Li. Celina, I thought we agreed to call me Gilbert. Gilbert. How's the new position treating you? It's great. I wanted to say thank you. Ah, don't sweat it. Ah, Mr... Gilbert. Why did you do it? Everybody needs a hand up once in a while. Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? I'm working. It's Sunday. I work on Sundays. Ah, it's a shame. I wanted to show you something. Maybe I can get it covered. I'll buy lunch. Mateo? Who was that? None of your business. So what, you into Asians now? What are you doing here? You're not gonna stop me from seeing my son. My son, okay? Where the hell has you been? He doesn't even know who you are. - I don't- - Stop it. This is my work, okay? Don't make a scene. Look, I'm sorry. I don't know, I guess I thought if I let you do this by yourself, you would realize that this is hard, and you would see that we should be together. 'Cause I still love you. I know you still love me too. So, you thought you'd leave me so that I would what, marry you? That was your plan? Stay away from me. Celina. Carlos didn't make it. He didn't make it back, and there's not even enough of him to put in a casket. I need you. If you want to see Christian, come sober. Well, it doesn't how many eggs you eat, you're making a losing trade. Your time for money. I mean, that's the stupidest trade a person can make. Stupider yet for a woman. Your time is worth half of a man's. I should know, I sign the checks. It's just the way it is. That might change in the future. But for now, there's no use getting upset about it, just get around it. How? Be more like the Chinese. You see, when California was nothing more than the Wild... You know what? I'm gonna need a little bit of help here. When California was nothing but the "Wild West", the government needed hard workers to build the land. So, they recruited the Chinese. But then the Gold Rush happened, and a wasteland because a treasure chest. The government now wanted them gone, so they made people afraid of them. Called them lewd, dangerous, that they take their jobs, also they could build support to pass a law. The Chinese Exclusion Act. They barred all Chinese people from immigrating, working, even marrying Americans. My great grandfather was one of those people. Where was he gonna go? This was his country now, he had been shaped by. And so he took its best advice. Hold yourself up by your bootstraps. He figured they could exclude him from picking gold, but not from picking dirt. He bought a road from the Wharf to the mines and built a streetcar. And now, the same people who excluded him, had to pay him to get to work every day. He would never be excluded again. This is our stop. You say you want to buy a house so you can never be kicked out. I say buy many, so you can never be kicked down. Wanna go inside? It's mine. Watch your step, okay? It's still very unfinished. I've been developing a lot of land around the city, and this is one of my properties. When it's done, I'll move in here, rent out the bottom two. What do you think? It's amazing. But? But I'm struggling so much as is for one place, how would I ever get a down payment for something like this? Stick with me, I'll show you. You're good with numbers, that's helpful. The first thing you're gonna do is open a savings account. It'll accrue interest. It's not much, but everything counts. You already have a second job, that's good. And you're saving where you can. You'll be making more, but try not to overspend. Keep at it, no sick days. And don't let yourself get distracted. What are you doing with your income tax return? I use it. Don't. That money was never yours to begin with. You're gonna invest it. In what? Stocks. Low risk company. It's called compounding interest. Don't worry about the market. It'll go up and down, but the key is to hold for as long as you can. Whatever you started with will grow. But I need the money. It was never yours. Gilbert? A customer for you. ♪ Happy birthday dear Christian ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Here you go, baby doll. 1972. I'm sorry, Ms. Guerrera. We're just not going to be able to provide the financing you're seeking. But I have a full down payment and a consistent employment history. Yes, I see that. It's just not our policy to provide credit to single women, Hispanics, Blacks, the gays, or the disabled. I didn't say that exactly, but I could have. This was all perfectly legal until 1974. Let's be honest, we still do it. Word to the wise, don't check the boxes. You know, best thing you can do is come back here with a co-signer. Most women come in with their husband. Or? Father. But here goes nothing. We can live upstairs and rent out the bottom. Can you talk to him? Talk to me about what? Hm? Look. What do you think? Hm, hm, hm. Ah. What do I think? That you're shameless. What? Since when have you been hiding that kind of money? You save up while you pay your mom nothing to watch your kid? That's not fair. Fair? Yes! Have you lost your mind? That money belongs to your mother and me! Go fuck yourself. No! No, Juan! Juan, no! No, baby, come here. What? You too? No, no, no! Touch my kid and I'll kill you. I'll kill you. Mom, come with me. No. Mom. No. Just leave. Leave. Mom. Just leave, please! It's okay, Mommy. Don't cry. Come here. Come here. Mommy, can we please go to papi's? Yeah. Yes, we can go to papi's. You know that I would never do this to you or Christian, right? Look, I have my faults, but that's not one of them. You both are safe with me. I'm sorry about Carlos. I never said that. I'm sorry about Marty. I never said that. Look, you've been going at this alone for so long. You don't have to. What about Lois? It's done. I just want my family. Let's do it. Let's get married. Gilbert? I wanted to say I'm so thankful for you for mentoring me. I really am grateful. You already said that. Have I done something to upset you? You don't stay late at the office anymore. I have Christian. Some would say you're not committed to your job. You can shut the door on your way out. Sir, the bank's closed, you're gonna need to leave. Sir, I think you're mistaken, the bank closes in 10 minutes. No, trust me, the bank's closed, you need to go. What do you mean the bank's closed, it's still- - It's okay, I'll take him. Thank you, ma'am, thank you. What can I do for you, sir? Calvin. You see, I have a little problem. I'm in construction, a contractor, just got this new client, it took me a long time to get this client. They didn't pay me the 50% start rate, they told me they'd pay me a whole after completion. I know that's not normal, but I really needed this job. You know, guys like me, clients can be hard to come by. Maybe it's the hat. The thing is, they told me that they would pay me last week, so I wrote out some checks to my crew. They didn't pay me until today, just a few minutes ago. That's why I'm cutting it so close on this. Mr. Calvin, it takes 3 days to clear a check. I understand that. Except that if all those checks that I wrote, if they bounce, you see the fees, they'll put me in the red along with my reputation, my business, but more importantly with my wife. Ma'am, I was just hoping that you could clear that one check, today. Look, ma'am, as God is my witness, that's a good check. Please. Thank you, ma'am. You have yourself a good night. You too. I thought you'd be happy, Minerva. I wasn't a fan of her placement, that's true, but she's done well. She works hard, and I see no reason to remove her. We're overstaffed, which means I can no longer justify having somebody in that position without the proper qualifications. I see. Perhaps her old position then? It's been filled. Gilbert... She has a child. And a new husband now, who I'm sure will manage. I'm gonna go talk to him. It's over. Don't make a scene. But why would he do this? Do you really think he was helping you without expecting anything? Open your eyes. Nothing is for free in this life, everything is a trade. What do you think you had to trade with? Hi. How was your day? It was- - Hey, I got you something. Come on. - I- - Okay, keep them closed, go. Forward, shorten, a little more. - Where am I going? - They closed? All right. All right, all right. - Here. - And open. What do you think, huh? It's pretty great, look at this. You've got this space and all these drawers for other things. I don't know, whatever you put in those. How much did you pay for it? No, no, no, we're not doing that. Don't worry, I put it on credit- - It's fine. - Credit? Stop. We're not having that discussion. We can afford it, that's why I did it. All right, I just want you to enjoy this. Come on, sit down, sit down. We're gonna be fine baby, sit down, sit down. Here you go. Look at that. Beautiful. You love it, right? Like, you love it. - Yeah. - Yeah? I love it. Good, baby. So, you were a typist at First City Bank for two years, and then a teller for three. That's a lot of experience. Thank you. Very impressive. Usually we have to train our girls. Not me, I'm ready to go. But you don't have a diploma? No, but as you said, I have 3 years of experience, and I work very hard and learn very fast. This all looks in order, we'll just have to call your previous position for references, so just one moment. We'll be in touch. We'll reach out. We'll be in touch. Hi. How'd it go? Okay, well, maybe it's good. To spend a little time at home for once. I need to work, Mateo. Yeah. Do what you want. What's the matter with you? I'm just tired of you acting like what I do is not enough. I bet you can't wait to get back out there. I wish you cared about your house and your kid as much as you do about your work. I'm leaving. Where are you going? I'm going to work, see if I can pick up a shift since we're so hard up. I didn't know you needed cologne to put up drywall. Yeah, yeah, I know. I have to get going now. All right. How's that, we feeling cleaner? Yeah. Yeah, a little bit? You got this one spot right here that I just can't get off. I'm calling about the studio in Kearny Street. Celina Guerrera. I spoke with you last week as well. No pets. It's just for me and my son. Do you know what's holding up the decision? Well, I'm looking for something as soon as possible, so anything that's available... Hello? God! Celina? Minerva? Calvin. How are you? You two know each other? Baby, this is the teller that helped me with that Patterson job. That was you? Why did you do that? It wasn't fair. People won't rent to single moms even if you pay in advance. Why don't you stay with us until you get on your feet? I can't. This is not the time to be stubborn. What she means is that we know a thing or two about being discriminated against. It's just, Christian's gone through so much change as it is. I'd like the next place to be our last. But thank you. So you know where to find us. Yeah, we're going to go over and talk to him right now and try to get- - Ma'am, please stay outside. No, no, no, this is my son. Get out of the way! Hi, papito. Hey, papito. Are you okay? What happened? I don't know. What happened? He fell from the counter trying to get a snack and he fractured his arm. You're lucky, it could've been much worse. Does it hurt? Not that much. I'll have to report this. Report this? He was clearly unsupervised. What? Angry yet? Frustrated? Ready to rip your fucking skin off? Want to scream at the top of your lungs no matter who is hearing? Good! He was sleeping! You don't leave a child by itself! Leave him alone! It's not his fault you let yourself get pregnant. Oh, this is America, speak English! - Shut the hell up! - Celina, Celina! Can we talk, please? What happened- - No, no, don't touch him! You knew Carlos had sent other girls to the dentist, didn't you? And it hadn't gone well, you knew! No, I didn't know, no, I didn't know! - You did, bullshit! - I didn't! - I didn't fucking know! - Bullshit! I didn't know! Why would I send you to a butcher, huh? Why would I do that? You said we'd be safe with you. Hm? Cel, can... Hey! How is he? He's strong. I wonder how he's gonna remember all of this. Will he ever understand what it was like? They always do in the end. Goodnight. Oh, papito. How do I keep you from turning into one? Huh? To end the war, and bring peace with honor in Vietnam and in Southeast Asia. On January 27th, 1973, at the International Conference Center in Paris. The ceasefire will take effect at 2400 Greenwich Mean Time, January 27th, 1973. The United States and the Democratic Republic- - Turn that shit off. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Someone sitting here? Peace with honor. Ah, what's this country coming to? Eh? There is no honor in losing. Men used to know that. You don't know what you're talking about. Ceasefire is not losing. There aren't no real men anymore. You better watch your mouth. Okay, you weren't there. Neither were you. Oh... Sit down! Oh, oh, now he wants to fight! All right, soldier boy. Bam, come on, vamo, vamo. Eh? Come on. Oh, you don't want to fight? What, you're a coward? Huh, you're a coward? You're a coward. Sorry, sorry. That's enough. Come on. Sorry, sorry. Come on, old man, come on. All right, all right. Come on. Come on. Sorry. Let me rest, let me rest, let me rest, let me rest. All right. What are you doing, huh? How's my daughter? I didn't mean for this to happen. Tell her I didn't mean this. She's not here. And I would clean yourself up. What are you doing here? I came to tell you something. No, no, no, no, no. My whole life I've been bad at everything. I was a bad husband, I was a bad soldier, but I don't have to be a bad father. Mateo, this is- - No, no, no, please. It's over, I know that. Okay, that's not gonna change. But it's not over between me and my son. Now, you can do anything you want when you put your mind on it, Cel, but you cannot be his father. Only I can do that. Because I'm his father. All right? That's who I am. Mateo says he wants to turn a new leaf with Christian. Do you think that's a good idea? I don't know what's a good idea anymore, I just know Christian needs a father. Hey, let me look at those shoelaces, papito. Come here. Mommy... What does that say? Um, I don't know, it's in Chinese. Will you hold him for a second? Yeah. What is it? I already told you, we can't help you. I'm not here for a loan. I'm here for a deed. What are you buying? You bought dirt? I bought land. They won't let me buy a house, they won't let me rent the house, but they can't stop me from building one. I guess the real question is, do you take checks? Ah, you know me. Not until the job's done. I came to congratulate the new owner. I see our time together was useful. I see that you are completely out of place. I deserve that. It's actually the reason why I decided to sell. What do you mean? This land. I was on the fence about it at first, but when I found out who the buyer was, I knew what I had to do. What do you want? A trade. Isn't everything? Your forgiveness, and my grandfather's. You both deserved more from me. We'll save the back lot for another one down the road and just use this front area here. Uh huh. Say that that leaves you enough space for a decent two bedroom. Thank you, babe. Three. Three bedrooms. For who? Hey. You needed me? Can you give me a compass? Compass? Uh, yes, I think. Hola, papito. Who's winning? Me! Okay. Turn on your radio! Cel, where's your radio? Uh, I think over there. What's happening? This broadcast to bring you live coverage. The Supreme Court today ruled that abortion is completely a private matter to be decided by mother and doctor in the first three months of pregnancy. The 7 to 2 ruling to that effect will probably result in a drastic overhaul of state laws on abortion, specifically the court today overturned laws in Texas and Georgia, and ruled the government has no right to enter into a decision which should be made by the mother and her doctor. During the second three months of pregnancy it ruled, a state may regulate abortion procedures, but only to ensure the safety of the mother. And in the last three months, whatever state laws say, prevails.
