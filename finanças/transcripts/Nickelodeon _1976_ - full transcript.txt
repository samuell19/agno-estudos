Order in the court. Quiet, please. No talking. Divorce court, city of Chicago, is still in session. Michael Robert Gilhooley, plaintiff, versus Edna Mae Gilhooley, defendant. That's you, Harrigan. That's us. - Just leave everything to me. - Yeah. Order in the court. Quiet down. Michael Robert Gilhooley brings suit for divorce against and asks damages from Edna Mae Gilhooley, his wife of five years. - Go ahead, Harrigan. - Thank you, Your Honor. It should please the court to know, that my learned colleague, Mr. Morgan, has informed me that his client, Mrs. Gilhooley, has finally responded to subpoena and is at this very moment waiting in the waiting room. - Well, why don't you call her, Harrigan? - Yes, I will. So as not to waste the court's time, Your Honor, I would like at this juncture to call Edna Mae Gilhooley, who has inflicted such cruel and inhuman punishment upon my client and lay bare all the sordid facts. Cruel and inhuman? - Any objections, Morgan? - None whatsoever, Your Honor. Call Mrs. Gilhooley. Mrs. Gilhooley. Do you, Edna Mae Gilhooley, solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Get going, Harrigan. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, Your Honor. - Mrs. Gilhooley. - Yes, sir? Your Honor. I have not as yet discussed this with my client, but I'm going to recommend to him that he drop his charges and throw himself on the mercy of the court. That, Mr. Harrigan, is a wise, if not very lucrative, decision. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Hey! You forgot your hat. The bailiff will now attempt to assist Mr. Harrigan as he runs from the courtroom. - Thank you, Your Honor. - Case dismissed. - Hey, Leo, what are you doing? - Practicing law. Hey, little rat! - Hey! I'm gonna get you this time. - I'm sorry. Dirty son of a... We'll murder you in court, Cobb. Come around here again and I might lose my temper. Did you say court? As it happens, I'm a... - Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. - Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah, well at least they didn't get the camera. How? What I want to know is how. - A spy! - A spy! - Seize that man. - Seize that man! No, I'm not. I was just looking... - Please, you're making a terrible mistake. - Lousy, maggoty Patents Company spies. You bastards ain't going to force H.H. Cobb out of pictures. Saw what happened to your hired thugs, didn't you? I'm a lawyer. I have a card. - Where are my writers? - Writers! - Tell him how tough I am! - You're making a terrible mistake. - What's the matter, Mr. Cobb? - Tell him. - Tell him what? - How tough he is. - Please, I can explain. - I hear a trolley. Steve. - Steve! - H.H. Cobb's so tough he eats nails. - And spits battleships. - Quiet! Why, you're not from the Patents Company. - No, sir. - You don't look dangerous enough. I'm a lawyer, sir. We're heading into the bush country, men. - Get my snake-bite puttees. - Puttees! L. Taylor Harrigan, sir, attorney at law. Get it figured out, boys. Come on, I'm falling asleep. - My card. - Here, Chief. We just can't get past the jail scene, Mr. Cobb. Well, get past it. Tell me how she loses her teeth. Does she have to? - That's what I have to know. - Lose her teeth? Of course, she has to lose her teeth. If she doesn't lose her teeth, the story has no bite. Teeth, bite. That's pretty good. Write that down, somebody. - Got it. - Wanna get in pictures, I suppose? Me? No, sir. I'm a lawyer. I couldn't help noticing that little altercation you had back there. Well, the first thing that came into my head is, "There's a man in need of counsel." - First thing, eh? - Yes, sir. Now, what about those pictures you were talking about? Pictures? Moving pictures. Galloping tintypes, Muldoon. Haven't you ever been to a nickelodeon? - Harrigan. - Nickelodeon. Ah, yes. And this Patents Company? It's not one company, Horace. It's all these big motion picture companies, ganged up together against us little ones. Ah, yes. Claim that they've got a patent on all the cameras. The truth is, they don't want us blanket companies making pictures. - The trolley's waiting, Mr. Cobb. - Blanket companies? - Independents, Clancy. Pay attention. - Harrigan, sir. - What? - Harrigan, sir. H-A double R-I-G-A-N. Like the man in the song. What song? By George M. Cohan, sir. It's a big hit. We don't need singers, O'Halloran, this is war. - We don't need singers. - Come on, we're going after him. - Hold this a second, will you, kid? - Yeah. Say, where are you people going? How's this? The old lady faints dead away when she sees her nephew? - He shouldn't be her nephew. - Mr. Cobb... - What should he be then? - Mr. Cobb, it sounds to me... - Why do you ask me? - ...as if a trust has been formed. - You're darn right, it's a trust. - Involving these patents. - He could be an Indian. - No Indians. - You just said the guy was Indian. - You just said he was! I'm prepared to take the position that this Patents Company is an unlawful conspiracy in restraint of trade. I've had three lawyers, son, and they all told me the same thing. But I like the way you announce it. Hold everything! I think the Wild Man's got something. - He's turning blue again. - I beg your pardon? Come on, Waldo, spit it out. He's on a... - Yes, yes. Get this down, quick! - I'm getting it, sir. ...ledge, 20 stories up, with... Come on, Waldo, you're doing great. ...his pajamas on, and... Just a little more, Waldo. Squeeze it out. And a live crab in his pants! He's done it again. God, why can't I get writers to think like that? - I wouldn't know. - What's he doing on the ledge? - Don't nitpick! - And who is he? - Nitpick! - Yeah. Who is he? Drama! What we've got is laughs and drama, an irresistible combination. Thank you, Waldo. Take a rest. - I don't like the crab. - He doesn't like the crab. - Well... - That crab is pure genius. All we gotta do is figure out how it got there. - And who he is. - Yeah, who is he, H.H.? That's for you to tell me. Come on, for heaven's sake. This is embarrassing. He could be a ranger. What did you say? - Oh, nothing. - Yes, you did. You said ranger. - I'm sorry. - That's it! - Is it? - What is he to the girl? He could be the girl's cousin. - She's his cousin? - He's her cousin. - Better yet. - Isn't that the same thing? Don't interrupt. The man is inspired. Go on, McDougall. Don't stop now. You're hot. - They're in love, of course. - Of course. - Madly. - Madly. I like it! Keep it coming, kid. What's he do about it? What does he do about it? He... He kidnaps her. And the old lady can't stand the thought! He's a forest ranger. That's how he gets the crab in his pants in a river. Forget the crab a minute. Then what happens? - Then what happens? - This is it, last stop. That's us, Mullins. Now, write it all down, figure out the finish, - and I'll pay you ten for it. - $10? All right, $15. Start writing, don't delay. Now, make it juicy, print legibly! Go on, get going. What are you waiting for? You're working for Kinegraph. Make it seven or eight scenes. Two for the beginning, three in the middle, two for the finish. Three if it's a real lollapalooza. - Three if it's a real... $15 cash? - On the barrelhead! Last stop. Everybody out! - Mr. Cobb, where... - Drop it by the office. But... Oh. Oh, dear. - I beg your pardon. - Oh, that's all right. I beg your pardon. Two for the beginning, three for the middle... Excuse me. - Say, are you all right? - Three if it's a real... - What? - Lollapalooza. - Hello. - Hello. - You fell down. - I do all the time. I'm blind as a rat. - Why didn't I help you? - You were talking to yourself. All aboard. - Do you live here in Chicago? - Not anymore. I'm going to New York City. When? - Now. - Now? Wait! - What's your name? - Kathleen Cooke. What's yours? - Leo Harrigan. H-A double R-I... - Like the man in the song. Yeah. Beg your pardon. I beg your pardon. - I beg your pardon. - Sorry. - No, I beg your... - No, it's my... ...pardon. ...fault. Are you with the Chautauqua? I'm looking for the Chautauqua. No, ma'am. I'm just off the train from Sopchoppy. - China? - No, ma'am. Florida. Everybody thinks that though. Can I help you up? Aren't you kind. Who's that Indian fellow you're looking for? - Indian fellow? - Chickawa? - Chautauqua. - Yeah. It's a theatrical tour and we're all leaving on the train tonight. Oh, that's too bad. Let me help you find him. You're very considerate. I hope I'm not taking you out of your way. Not at all, ma'am. I couldn't find my glasses, so I'm late. It's my first real job in the show business. Do you ride in the circus? - Why would you say that? - Your suit. Oh, no, ma'am. I don't ride at all. I hate horses. - But you are in show business, aren't you? - Oh, yes, ma'am. I used to run all the alligator fights down in Sopchoppy. - You fought alligators? - Holy sailor, no, not me. I used to introduce the alligators to the Indians, then get out of the way. I come up north here to make my fortune in the clothing business. Cooke! Kathleen Cooke! Come on, you're late! There they are. Well, thank you, Mr... Tom Greenway, but everybody down in Sopchoppy calls me Buck. - Okay, Buck, what do you want? - Goodbye, Mr. Greenway. So long, Miss Cooke. Hold on a second. Look, I'm trying to locate a fellow who lives here that goes by the name of Mr. Hoot de Longpre. - No, he doesn't. - Ain't this the Hotel Rialto? No, it's the Rialto, and Mr. de Longpre left last week for the rodeo. But, see, this fellow down in Yeehaw Junction gave me $20 to deliver this here saddle to Mr. Hoot de Longpre at the Hotel Rialto. Now, what the heck am I going to do now? - Oh, Mr. Greenway, good luck. Break an arm. - She means break a leg. - Why I got to break anything? - Obviously not in show business. - Cowboy, you working? - What? - You working, cowboy? - You Mr. Hoot de Longpre? No, I'm with the Clansman Company over at the New Amsterdam Theatre. - Hey, can you ride a horse? - Why? 'Cause we got a show on right now and our only horseman got drunk last night and broke his leg. Can you ride or not? - How much does it pay? - $10. $10? In advance? - Okay. You better know how to ride a horse. - Mister, that's my middle name. - What on earth are you going to do, sir? - Find the fiend who did this crime. - But there's no trace of him there. - We shall see. I believe a glass of sufficient power will reveal on the retina of those dead eyes the image of the killer as though etched in fire! - You mean... - Yes! Impressions remain on the brain like words written on paper with invisible ink! The fire-etched record... - Mr. Dinsdale, Louie found a rider. - Don't shout. Be quiet. What? Speak up. - Louie found a rider. - Where? Bring him in. - He's coming. - Can we make it? - There he is. - Barely. - Get ready for the ride. - Ready to ride. - Double time. - And double it. - Howdy, fellows. - What are you, in the circus? Ever ride in a show before? Put me on the animal and point me the right way. 50 seconds, Mr. D. - 50 seconds. - Hey, this must be my costume, huh? If you fall off or get hurt, Circus, don't expect no extra pay. And if you get killed, we don't supply the funeral. - Get him on! - That's mighty encouraging, sir. - Climb on, hurry up. - Yes, sir. Here I go. Howdy, old stinker. - Cyclone. - Cyclone? - Hey, mister, other side! - The other side? - Oh, left-handed horse, huh? - Where did you find this dude? Hurry up, boys, get him on. - Riding's his middle name, sir. - What I got to do? - Just stay on that treadmill. - Wait a second. - The horse knows what to do. - Hold it a second. What treadmill? - On the stage. - How do I see out of this contraption? - Cross. Cross. - Cross. Cross. - Cross? - Through the eye-hole, stupid. - Hold on a second. - Wave it around! - Hold on a second! - Horse! How do you get off this thing? Stop, horsey. Blizzard, stop. Hurricane. Rain. For you. Howdy, ma'am. A fellow gave me this here card last night. And a person wrote on the back of it that I... I could come over to this here bakery and earn some money, if I was to ask for a German bagel. We're going in the back and have a bagel. In. In. In. In. You are here what? Your name is why? My name is Buck Greenway, sir. And a fellow gave me this here card. - What you all doing here, anyway? - Bread-baking. Look, I'll just be on my way. No hard feelings. - Hold it! - Don't move! You will ride for us. $10. $10? Let me get this straight. You all want me to deliver your bread on a horse for $10? - No, no, horse in pictures. - Pitchers? - Yeah. - Pitchers of what? Milk? - Milk? - Milk pitchers. No, no. Movie pictures. Bang! Bang! You don't understand English? - You want me to ride a horse? - Yes. Well, okay, that's my middle name. No, I ain't feared of nothing. And I can shoot real good, too. Hey, you all are German, ain't you? Why you wearing that suit, stupid Mr. Horse? Well, these are just my dress clothes. I got my working clothes over here. I'll show 'em to you. Yeah. These ain't my clothes. Out of the way. Hit it again. Out of the way. Now get in there. Miss Cooke. - Let's go. Come on. - Find the damn cameras! Smash these tanks. Come on, tear the place apart, here. Smash these tanks. - You Patents Company bastards! - Get out of the way! Now, those are my clothes. Hey, wait a minute! That saddle don't belong to me. Come on, tear the place apart, here. Smash these tanks. - Check that closet out there. - I think I found it. The man killed a box. I'm gonna get out of here. - What was that? - Good job, sport. That takes care of everything. The place is wrecked. Let's go. Mike, help this man with his things. Come on boys, wake up. Fellow, you're swell. - Let's go before things get out of hand. - You the law? We're the Patents Company, fellow. - This your saddle? - This your suitcase? - Is that your hat? - Yeah. No. Yeah. These are my clothes. Come on, we might got a place in our organization for a big guy like you. - You like to travel? Can you shoot? - That's my middle name. Stop, this is terrible. My mother could do better. - I've got another one. - Bring her in then. You're just used to it. The hell I am. What's it look like to you, Harrigan? - What? I wasn't watching. - Ah, you see? It smells. I tell you what you do, Herbert. Take the first sequence, put it where the second one is, and take the third sequence, put it where the first one was. But that won't make any sense. No, but it'll get a laugh. And that makes sense. Dollars and cents. Call it The Tell-Tale Knife, kid, better title. - Lights! Go on. - Whatever you say. Don't sulk, Herbert. It's not manly. Everybody's temperamental. Watch out what you say about my mother! Now, give me drama with pathos. Give me a story with heart-throbs. Shatter the nerves. I said pastrami, not spaghetti! Albert, H.H. - H.H. How are you, Boss? - Make it snappy. I'm writing a scenario. Feed Waldo and give me a ginger beer. - How'd you hear? - Telegram. - Telegram? Who sent it? - Oh, that's Chauncey Wheelock. - Wheelock. - Yeah, the director, Wheelock. I knew I never should have sent that Irish son of a bitch out there. - No offense, kid. - What do you want me to do about it, Boss? Oh, let me chew on this. I'll get back to you. He's turning blue, Mr. Cobb. Not now, Waldo, I can't do two things at once. - I'm choking. - Not now! I sent those idiots out to California so they could capture on moving picture film scenes of historical association and natural loveliness, so they'd be free of these goddamn Patents Company hooligans that I have to put up with every day. And what happens? - What happens? - What happens? I'm telling you, for Pete's sake. Keep your shirt on. What happens is that for three weeks we have received no film from California, not one foot. - I have made a decision. - You hate the story. - You! - You hate me. How would you like to make 30 a week, plus expenses? - Thirty dollars? - All right, 35. Not a penny more! Mr. Cobb, I'm a little... I should've known better than to trust a man who calls himself Chauncey Wheelock. Claims he's a playwright and a director. Claims he's another Griffith. He's another Griffith, all right. Max Griffith, the butcher down the block. - Who's Griffith? - What? - I was just wondering... - Who is Griffith? You mean to say that you don't know who David Wark Griffith is? - D.W. Griffith? - Well, I think I've heard the name. You think you've heard? Why, he's only the greatest film director in the world. God damn him. Man, D.W. Griffith is the best thing that's happened to pictures since the invention of the camera. - And this fellow Wheelock? - Is the worst! I sent him out to California to take advantage of the sunshine, to run my West Coast company. Now I get a telegram which says, "I've lost stories. Send more." Lost stories? Where? In the toilet? - Harrigan, stand up! - Yes, sir. Harrigan, I want you to take the train to California. - Me, sir? - Take five of your best stories. - Have you got five? - Five? - Well, I think maybe I... - Take 10! Take them out there and if you see anything fishy, if you smell a rat, if it ain't kosher, I want you to consider yourself fully empowered. But get that camera turning. Remember, it's war. Give them hell, boy. - I'll do my best. - God be with you. Last call for dinner. Last call for dinner. What's all that? We're pulling into Kansas City, Mr. Harrigan, and it's the last call to dinner. - Oh, thank you. - Don't mention it. Last call for dinner. Okay, let's see. Okay, let's go, Reese. We'll be here all day if we wait for her. - Okay, okay, okay. Come on, Kathy, let's go. - I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Oh, heavens! - My goodness! - Miss Cooke! - Mr. Mulligan. - Harrigan. Oh, goodness, there they are. Okay, I'm coming, Mr. Duncan. - Goodbye, I have to go now. - Goodbye? No, wait. - I can't. Where are you going? - California. - We're going to California. - You are? When? Oh, I don't know exactly. It's so confusing. They said whistle-stop tour and they weren't fooling. Is there any place I could write you, Kathleen? - Oh, you remembered my whole name. - Allow me. And I called you Mulligan. I can't get anything right. - You can call me anything you want. - Then, goodbye, Mulligan. Come on, Miss Cooke, come on, Miss Cooke. No fraternizing, fellow. - But... What? - All aboard, Mr. Harrigan. Come on, the train's leaving. - Goodbye. - See you soon. - I hope so. - So do I. - Good luck. - You mean, break an arm. What? All out, Kansas City. Kansas City, all out. "The Virginian's pistol came out, and his hand lay on the table. "He issued his orders to the man Trampas. "'When you call me that, smile.' "And he looked at Trampas across the table." Front of the car! Front of the car! Put your bonnet on, put your bonnet on. Advertise, advertise! Will you get to the front of the car, Miss Cooke? Miss Cooke! I got you. - Oh, Mr. Greenway. - Howdy. - I tripped. - I'm glad. Front of the car, girls. Front of the car. Come on, Miss Cooke. - I'm coming, Mr. Duncan. - No fraternizing, fellow. Oh, porter, wait. I have your suitcase, Mr. Greenway. And I got yours, Miss Cooke. I don't know how it happened. Probably my fault. I'm blind as a rat, you know. And all sorts of people standing around when I first opened it. - It was very embarrassing. - Yeah, I can imagine. - I hope you're not going to shoot me. - No, no. It's just a new job I got. Shooting? No. Sort of law enforcement, I guess you could call it. - I was hoping I'd run into you. - So was I. Oh, dear. I have it. - Sorry. - That's all right. Thanks to you, I finally get a chance to change my clothes, now. These are about to walk away on me. Whoops. - Those aren't your clothes? - Nope. - Well, whose clothes are they? - Can't say. - Somebody doesn't have their clothes. - Yes, ma'am. Me. Mulligan. - My name's Greenway, ma'am. - Yes, I know. - Miss Cooke! - Mr. Duncan. Would you like to have some supper, ma'am? - Oh, gee, I'd love to. Except we... - Miss Cooke, go to your room. Yes, sir, Mr. Duncan. Yes, sir. Stay away from my girls, dude. - You all right, miss? - I'm fine. - You in the circus or what? - No, I ain't. - Sir, where are we? - I just announced it, Mr. Harrigan. Cucamonga. - Right on time. - What? But the porter was supposed to wake me. Why didn't he wake me? Well, sir, he's only human. You'd better hurry up. The train's right on time. These aren't my clothes. Cucamonga. I'm not ready. If I had my own suitcase. I should... Go away. Stop it. - Did you see that dog? - What dog was that, Mr. Harrigan? - Oh, look at that. - What? - Your jacket's ripped, Mr. Harrigan. - Thank you very much. Oh, don't mention it, Mr. Harrigan. Goodbye now. All aboard. Hello, little girl. Pleased to meet you. I'm L. Taylor Harrigan, from Chicago, looking for one Chauncey Wheelock. Have you seen an ugly little dog running around here anywhere? Yes, as a matter of fact, it bit me. - Good. Where'd he go? - Off that way. - Your jacket's ripped. - Yes, I know. But could you just... - 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. - 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. ...three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Hello. Good morning. - Your jacket's ripped, mister. - Yes, I fell off the train. Yes, sir, that's what happened, all right. Say, I was wondering, would you by any chance know the whereabouts of a fellow named Chauncey Wheelock? He's a moving picture director. He's supposed to be around here somewhere. I need to find him. Why? - Did someone say something? - I said, why? Hello. I'm L. Taylor Harrigan, from Chicago. You're not, by any chance, Mr. Wheelock, are you? - Don't let him get away. - Wait, stop! Stop it! Stop it! He's laughing. Well! I never! - That was assault. - You a snake-oil salesman, mister? - Those are not my clothes. - How's that? I mean, those are my clothes. - You L. Taylor Harrigan? - Yes. He's okay, boys. Here's a card from old Corny Cobb. Well, what an interrogation! Sorry, Mr. Harrigan, but we're all a little touchy about those Patents guys. - Oh, you thought that I... - I'm Frank Frank. - What? - Frank Frank. You didn't look dangerous, but we can't take chances. No, of course. And this is the crew. Jimmy, John, Dobie, Jack. And Mr. Reginald Kingsley. - Charmed. - He's the actor. And Sally there, he owns the place. - What about Wheelock? - That drip. He went on a bender and we ain't heard or seen him for weeks. Four weeks. And we ain't been paid in that long, neither. Yeah, he took most of the last payroll with him. - Son of a bitch. - Well, that's just awful. - Then you've been stranded here. - Yeah, and it ain't exactly Paris, France. Right. Yes, of course. I better send a telegram. Where can I send a telegram? - Anywhere you want. - No, I mean where from? From where? Over to the depot, Mr. Harrigan. Oh, thank you very much. Call me Leo, won't you? I'm Margaret Reeves. Everybody calls me Marty. Very pleased to meet you, Marty. - Good to meet you, Leo. - Same here, Frank Frank. Well... - I believe this is yours. - Oh, yes. Thank you. Gentlemen, telegram. I would like to telegraph Chicago. It's an emergency. If it's an emergency, why don't you try that there new public telephone? See if it'll work. Ain't nobody called as far as Chicago yet. The telephone. Good idea. Get fast results. Hello, hello, hello. Central. I would like to call Chicago, Illinois. That's Kinegraph. K-I-N-E graph. Yes, and can you bill it to them there, please? - Right. - Can I have your name, please? My name is Harrigan. H-A double R-I... - Like the man in the song. - Yes, just like the man in the song. By George M. Cohan, yes. - I hear it, it's ringing. - Son of a bitch! - Kinegraph. - Mabel? This is Leo Harrigan. May I speak to Mr. Cobb, please? She's got the money. She's going to try and get him. He's in three meetings. - Sounds right. - Is that you, Harrigan? - Mr. Cobb? It's him. - Where are you? - Mr. Cobb, I'm in Cucamonga. - Is Wheelock there? No, Wheelock's not. He went on a bender. - He disappeared. - Disappeared? - He's yelling now. - Drunken Irish son of a... He took the last payroll with him. - Took the payroll! - He's yelling again. I'm going to have him decapitated. Well, I suggest that you send some money to these people, so that they can be paid and... And then, I think that... That you should disband the company. - No. - Disband the company? Out of work. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. You will send money immediately. And you want me to take my stories. Yes, they're ready. And you want me to what? - Oh, no, Mr. Cobb, I don't think that's... - Don't argue with me! No, really. Yes, I know, but that's not... No. He's fading out. Don't fade. Hello, Mr. Cobb... Hello, hello, hello... He wants me to direct. Good morning, Sally. Good morning. Hello, little girl. I see you got your dog back. - Quiet, Leo. - I beg your pardon. I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to Leo. The dog's name is Leo. Good morning, everyone. - Good morning. - Good morning. Well, it certainly is a beautiful morning. - Who's that? - That's the director. That's the director? - Frank Frank. - Yes, sir. - Could I speak to you for a minute, please? - Yes, sir. We'll be right back. What's the matter? Frank, to be quite frank, I don't know how to do it. - Do what? - Direct. - You don't? - No. Gee! Well, don't just say gee. I'm a nervous wreck. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Do you always wear your clothes so big? These aren't my clothes. - Well, whose are they? - I don't know. You don't know how to direct... And I don't know whose clothes, that's right. Anything else? Hey. - Well, didn't you ever see Cobb direct? - No, I was writing. God, this is humiliating. Hey, look, take it easy. It's real simple. You'll have no problem. - I won't? - Hell, no. Any jerk can direct. Now, you see over there? - Marty and Kingsley? - Yeah. - Putting on their white makeup? - Yeah. - Those are the actors. - Thank you very much. Okay. Now, you see over there, that box on the sticks? - Yes. - John's putting a blanket over it right now? - Yes. - That's the camera. Well, the first thing you do is tell me where to put it. I'm about to. No. I'm the cameraman. - Oh, you are? - Yes, sir. - Well, hello. - Hello, sir. - Leo. - Frank. - No, I'm Leo. - Yes, I know. Go on. Okay. Then you tell the actors what you want them to do in front of the camera. You tell me to crank it. And when you've had enough, - you just tell me to cut. - Cut. Then you do the same thing all over again with the next scene and that's it. - That's it? - That's it. - That's all D.W. Griffith does? - Sure, more or less. They tell me Griffith doesn't say "cut," he says "cease." - Griffith says "cease." Well, I can do that. - Then you can direct. Let's go. All right, let's go. Good morning, everyone. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. All right... - Dobie, wasn't it? - Yes, sir. - Oh, you don't have to call me sir. - Oh, well, we always call the director sir, sir. Oh, you do. I'm sorry. The story we're doing today is called Luke's Revenge. Could you be Luke? Excuse me, Mr. Harrigan, I am Reginald Kingsley of the New York stage. I normally play the leading roles. I would be Luke. - Oh, yes, of course. - What happens to me? Well, in the first scene, Luke's horse throws him and he gets killed. Luke gets killed in the first scene? - That's right. - Then I do not play Luke. - Oh, well, perhaps he only gets hurt then. - I do not fall from horses. I see. Well... Does anyone have any ideas how we could kill Luke? - He could get shot. - Yeah, except it should be an accident. He could shoot himself. Well, that does not have quite the dramatic impact we're searching for. He could get bit by a rattlesnake. - Did you say something, little girl? - I said, he could get bit by a rattlesnake. A rattlesnake. Yes, that's a very good idea, little girl. Except, we haven't got a rattlesnake. - Now does anyone else have... - I've got a rattlesnake. - You've got a rattlesnake? - Yes. - A little toy rattlesnake or something? - A real rattlesnake. His name is Robert. Robert the rattlesnake? - Yes. It'll cost you $5. - Five dollars? For the day? For two hours. - All right, little girl. - Alice. All right, Alice, can we have a look, or is there a price for that too? You can look for free. She's got a rattlesnake. - Yeah. Ain't that something. - Son of a bitch. - Here he is. - Ah, that was fast, little girl. - Alice. - Alice. Let's have a look. It bit me. My God, you can die from the bite of a rattle... - I could die from this. - Holy smoke, he got bit by a rattlesnake. Little girl, your rattler bit that young man. Don't worry. Robert's poison sac's been removed for years. He can't hurt a fly. They do this to all the directors. - That's nice. - Yeah. - We got it, we got it! - Just drink this down, sir, quick. - What? What is it? - It's old Injun remedy. - Chipawau. - Chipa what? - Chipawau. - But... Just chug-a-lug it down, sir, so it can beat the poison to your heart. If it gets there first, it disinfects the heart and the poison can't get in. - Hurry. - Oh, mother of mercy. - Frank Frank! - Sir, sir! Aim the camera at Ronald. - Robert. - Robert. - Aiming. - Kingsley? Mr. Harrigan. - Stand next to it. - I do not play scenes with reptiles. - Well, what do you do? - I emote. Then never mind. - Just photograph Roger. - Robert. - Robert. - All set, Boss. - All right, Frank, crank. - Cranking. We're going to make pictures. I said, we're going to make pictures. Pictures with drama and heart-throb. Pictures with comedy and pathos. Pictures with thrills and romance! And if any Patents Company son of a... I said, if any Patents Company son of a... - Where is he? Where is he? - On the roof. There's the son of a bitch. - On the roof. - Give me a gun. Get him! Who is he? Don't kill him. - The camera okay? - Yeah, just barely. Don't kill him! Patents bastards. Patents? But don't kill him. Let me kill him. Goddamn Patents bastards didn't tell me they were going to shoot back! You're doing great, sir. Come on, boys, let's get him. - We're with you, Dobie. - Now, you stay here, Marty. - Staying? - Where's Leo? - I'm right here. - Not you. Don't let him get away. Hey, wait for me! Whoa, horsey. Whoa. Don't shoot. You might hit the horse! - Ain't no use in going after him now. - Nope, that's Hurricane. - He's a... - Goner. - Son of a bitch. - Hello? Where is everybody? - Stop this... - Look at him ride. Come on, now. Please. Get down off that horse immediately, young man. I want to have a word with you. Look out! He tried to kill me. Get, pluckies. Get! - Hey, you, wait a minute. - He's gonna need help. - Oh, hell. - Oh, come on. Come on, folks. I think there's gonna be a fight. - I got him. - I don't want to fight. We got him! - Now, hold still. - Oh, he's feisty! You're doing great. I don't like fighting women and children! - Quit wriggling. - You kicked me. You shot at my camera, you Patents Company son of a bitch. One thing I hate, it's a sloppy drunk. Well, that settles it. Hold these, please. Get up. Get up, you skunk. You got a lot of help, mister. Don't anybody help me! No matter what happens, don't anybody help me! That sounds like a bad idea, Leo. Not at all. I was boxing champion of my class at the University of Chicago. I am trained in fisticuffs. Get up, you coward. That's the way it's going to be! Put me down! This is not the Marquis of Queensbury rules. I knew it was a bad idea. - Come on. - I don't want to fight you. - Come on, you coward. Let's box. - I don't want to fight you. Look, I'm warning you, I got an alligator farm. - What? - I got an alligator... I warned you... - Say, he can... - Box. - Son of a bitch. - That Harrigan's a pretty good fighter. It's not over yet. You kicked me! You kicked me! - Hey, no kicking. - Yeah, no kicking. That's not fair. Did you see that? - Kicking is fair! - No biting. - I wasn't ready. - You ready now? Yes. Are we observing the Marquis of Queensbury rules? Sure. We are not observing the Marquis... That's it, Leo! Punch him! No kicking. Time out. Hold it. Hold it! Hit it, stranger! - Do you mind? - All right, all right. - Don't you trust me? - No, I don't. Marquis... Queens Marquis rules, you know. Go ahead. Has anybody got any water? I'm dying of thirst. Stop it! Let go! Hey, you're doing great, Boss. Leo, get away from there, will you? Leo, he's on our side. - Well, I guess you give up now, don't you? - I most certainly do not. - Get up. Come on, coward, get up. - Now I'm getting mad. Hey, he's dancing like Leo. Come on, stranger. Give me a hand, will you? Don't let them get away! You give... - No. - No. No. - You thirsty? - Very. Oh, good. Well, it looks like my place is the only thing left standing, so folks, follow me. The drinks are on the house. Never seen a fight like that before. Here you are, Boss. You're doing great. Just great. I believe those are my pants you've got on. I'm a suck-egg mule if they ain't mine. - These? - Yeah. - You wear these? - Purty, ain't they? How in the world did... Wait a second. Did you meet a girl? - Blind as a rat? - Tells you to break your arm. - Falls down a lot. - Kathleen. Cooke. - My God. - Glory be. - I got to hand it to you, Dan. - Leo. You got a mean left for a Northern boy. - And you, too. - Thanks. - And you know what? - What? I like your looks. You ain't funny, are you? No. Did you ever think about getting in the picture business? Thought about getting out of it! - Oh, get out of that damn Patents Company. - It ain't worth it, Dan. - Listen, you sure can ride a horse. - Well, it's sort of my middle name. Well, why don't we have us a snort and see if we can work it out. Okay, if you can get me up out of here. I'll tell you what, Dan. Just tell me about when you met my girl. What do you mean your girl? When did you meet her? Springtime, New York City. Well, then I saw her first, Dan, back in Chicago. Long before she ever thought about going to New York City. - Is that a fact? - Nothing but a fact. - Why we used to go sailing on Lake Erie. - Well, I took her down to my alligator farm. Well, looks like we got ourselves a new leading man. - Yeah. - That big lug. Wait a minute, wait a minute! Miss Cooke, you're supposed to be a clod dancer, not a clod hopper. - Well, I'm trying. - I thought it was nice. - What? - Didn't you, Jim? - Real nice. - Who the devil are you? We telephoned about your balloon for the moving picture company. - You Duncan? - Oh, yeah. Well, girls, girls, take a break, girls. Yes, the balloon'll cost you $50 for the day. - Give you 30. - I said 50, little girl. - Give you 25. - I said 50. - Give you 20. - You just said 25! - That's a deal. - What? - Is that your kid, fellow? - Hell, no. My name's Alice. What's yours? - Kathleen. - I like that name. - Well, I like yours. - I hate it. But why? It's a good name. Nah, it ain't, 'cause you can't make a nickname out of it. Except Al or something stupid like that. Everybody's just gotta call you Alice. Hey, kid! Kid! - That dog's got a mean streak. - Here's your money. - Do you belong to that mutt, kid? - Come on, Leo. Nice talking to you. Hey, Alice should live in a palace. Can't do that with my name. Hey, this is only 25 bucks. - That's what you said. So long, Kathleen. - Bye, Princess. - Princess? Where'd you get that? - Well, who do you think lives in palaces? Oh, yeah. Now you just hold on a minute, there, young lady. I don't care what you say, Dan, I ain't going to do it. Have I ever lied to you, Dan? - Yeah, you have, several times. - I have not. Luke's Revenge, Rattlesnakes and Gunpowder... I've only tried to make you comfortable in uncomfortable situations. - Don't try to sweet talk on me, Dan. - That is a director's job. I don't like being up off the ground. What are you when you're on a damn horse? Okay, fair enough. I'll go as high as my horse. Fine. How high's a horse, 10, 12 feet? - Six. A horse is six feet. - A short horse. Short or tall, that's as high as this explorer's going. Six feet. Do you want everybody to think you're scared? I am scared. Look, a horse is human. That thing is full of hot air, just like you. - All right. Dobie. - Don't go no higher than six feet. - Take it up to six feet and hold it. - It's as high as I'm going. - Six feet! - Marty, Marty! - Yes, Leo. - Oh. You run in when I yell. - Yes, Leo. - Well, go on, Dan. - Get in the damn thing. - I'm getting, I'm getting. - Did you see that? - Hold it steady, boys. - We don't want to lose the leading man. - I gotcha, don't worry. Everything all set, Alice? - Princess. - What? - Princess. - Alice should live in a palace. - Has everybody gone crazy today? - Not crazy enough to go up in that thing. - What'd he say? - I'm getting a lot of help today. Okay, let him up 30 feet. No, no, no, no! Miss Cooke! Please, take it from the top again. Now listen, I can change that to Three Dutch Damsels in five minutes, you know. Well, you do that, you big poop. Poop? What did you call me? Poop! As in poop-deck. As in stern. As in rear end. Wave farewell, Dan. Give us that confident grin. The world is our oyster. Be natural. That's not six feet. New horizons, Dan. All the arrogance of youth. - Harrigan, I'm gonna kill you. - That's good. Smile. I swear I'm going to strangle you. - Watch out. - What? - Help! - My God, it's her. - Jesus Christ. - What happened? Where am I? Grab her, Jack. - Kathleen! Kathleen! - You know her, too? - Miss Cooke. - Everybody knows her. - What do I do? Cut? - Are you kidding? Keep turning. - They're drifting! - Alice, get the truck. Everybody, onto the truck, now! Bring that camera. Let's go. On the truck? I've never done that before. Don't be scared, miss. Stay right there. I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you, miss. Don't be scared. Here comes a rope. - Grab the rope. - Where is it? By your head. Stop wiggling. - That don't help none. - I see it. - I've got it. - Now hang on. Now hang on, hang on, miss. Cooke, you're fired, damn it! - Get the truck, you fools. That's our balloon. - Hurry up! Hurry up! Take off, Alice. Follow them. We'll miss the rescue. Hang on, miss. Hang on, I almost got you. Here we go. Hang on now. I got you. Grab my hands, grab my hands. - Grab my hands, grab my... - I'm trying. - Okay, I got you. - Okay. I almost got you. Here we go, come on in now. Okay. Why, Mr. Greenway, you've grown a mustache. - Miss Cooke. - I tripped. - Stand up, stand up. We can't see you. - Harrigan, I'm gonna pulverize you. - Did you say Harrigan? Not Leo Harrigan? - I think I'm going to be sick. Do that again where it almost tipped over. That was good. I swear I'm gonna strangle you! Don't look into the camera, you big oaf! Be natural. - If I just had my rifle. Oh, God! - Don't look down, Mr. Greenway. I can't see a thing, so I'm not scared at all. - Then you're as crazy as he is. - Just don't look down. - Don't look down? - That's right. Don't look down. - I won't look down. - No, take your hands away from your face. - Play the scene. - What's he doing? Keep looking at me. - He's directing a picture. - A moving picture? How exciting. I've never even seen one. Well, Miss Cooke, it's just possible you never will. Be debonair. You're an explorer. - For Pete's sake, Alice, come on. - I can't help it. There's no road here. - Well, be careful. How is it, Frank? - Swell between bumps. They're going toward the railroad tracks. - Well, so what? Follow them. - There's a train coming. What? Should I try to beat it? - Yes, beat the train. - Hang on. - No, maybe not. - I can beat the train. Don't beat the train, Alice. - I can beat it! - Don't beat it. - I can! - Alice, don't! Hail Mary, full of grace. Too bad it didn't hit them. - Do you hear a hiss? - What? What kind of hiss? - Like air escaping. - That ain't funny. Okay, take off, Alice. Follow them. Oh, my God, I think you're right. Did you see that, for God's sake? - I don't believe it. - Still turning. Keep turning. Alice, stop on the tracks. What a shot! Kiss her, kiss her, for God's sake! - He says I'm supposed to kiss you, ma'am. - Yes, he did. Well, he's the director. Perfect. Hold it a little longer, Frank. Slow Iris to black. And cease. Cut. That's it. Okay, wrap it up, everybody. Get them off. Now bring the train back. Oh, God, how are we going to get them back? That's damn good, Leo, as far as I can tell. - Thanks, Sally. - Here, have a beer. Good? It was great. Not even Mr. Griffith gets stuff like that, Leo. Not by accident anyway. How about a hand for the cameraman? I don't see where my role fits in. Oh, come on, Kingsley, you wouldn't know a good film if it bit you in the nose. Reggie's got a point. That's what's been bothering me. What are we going to do with this stuff? I mean, what's the plot? Why is that girl in a silly Dutch costume? - And who is she? - You got me. - That's... - Kathleen, ain't it? - Kathleen Cooke. - Yeah, but who is she in the story? - Oh, yeah. - I didn't think of that. - That's a... - Problem. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah. The boy and the girl are madly in love with each other, but they're from two old Dutch families who've been feuding for years. They're told they must never see each other again, ever. So the boy decides to take off in his balloon and explore the vast unchartered regions of Africa and forget his only love. But at the very last minute, though, she defies her father and rushes off to be at his side. She trips and ends up in the balloon, which lands on a train and takes them to Africa where they live happily ever after. You can call the picture Romeo's Balloon. Alice, that's terrific. Whoa, Alice you just fixed the whole... I'll play the father. Never darken my door again, young man. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What about the stuff we've already shot with Buck and Marty? She could play his sister. You just change the titles. - I like it. - Yeah. Yeah. You don't mind playing the sister? Well, I can't be the brother. And about the money... That'll be $15. Fifteen dollars? Why, you stole the whole thing from William Shakespeare. So what? You steal everything from the Saturday Evening Post, and they pay you. - Feel better now? - Except for one slight problem, yes. They'll be back, Coach. - They've only been gone two days. - A day and a night and a day. Hey, Chief, looky here. The train just brung in The Gazette and we're in it. - Picture and everything. - Look at that. There's you and there's me, I guess. Big as life. Big as life. - I don't see my likeness anywhere. - I don't either. Now those Patents bastards are going to know Buck lied to them. - About not finding us here, you mean? - Yeah. - Oh, they don't read the Gazette. Do they? - Leo's right, we better get out of town. - Son of a bitch. - Yeah. Well... - Where we going to go? - I don't know. - We could go use the ostrich farm. - I thought you said ostrich farm. That's 'cause I did say it. I got one over at La Mesa. It's pretty deserted now except for five ostriches and Aunt Lula. I could use the rent. That's the tallest damn horse I've ever been on in my life, Harrigan. - You owe me for two train tickets. - What did you do to your mustache? Don't you try to change the subject. Well, Dan, I guess he was a bit taller than I expected. Hello, Miss Cooke, long time no see. - Mr. Mulligan. - Harrigan. You got any idea how hard a horse that tall can kick? Well, I think I'm going to find out. - How was that damn stuff? - It was great. Glad to have you back.
