[music playing] [music playing] You seem real nice. What's your name? Marlena. You like it here? I like it here. Ow. Stop it. You're hurting me. How do you feel? OK, I guess. Just don't make me wait too long next time, OK? You know, you're the best thing that ever happened to me. I wanna stay with you forever. You will, baby. You have no choice. Why don't we split this pit of a town? I think we've overstayed our welcome. How about some bright lights, Richard? Ruben, before we go in front of the jury, is there anything that you can tell me that might help with your case? Ruben, Mr. Spanner asked you something important. And sit up straight. What? Like why your fingerprints were all over her house. I told you a million times, man. I was over there a lot. For what purpose? Our jobs. Stuff like that. Ruben, a beer bottle was found under her bed with your fingerprints on it. What were you doing in her bedroom? Excuse me, but we've got-- It's OK, Mr. Spanner. This is Reverend Jondular. I work for him at his church. I asked him to come here for spiritual support. Reverend Jondular, this is Ruben's attorney, William Spanner. It's a pleasure to meet you Mr. Spanner. I'm so glad you've taken on Ruben's case. Are you all right, Ruben? What do you think, man? Watch your manners. Yeah, everything's fine. The prosecuting attorney is going in front of the grand jury. She's asking for the death penalty. Ruben, you can't plead your case from the gas chamber. But he's innocent. Ruben's a good boy! Well, the prosecuting attorney doesn't think he's such a good boy and neither will the jury. Ruben, stop wasting everybody's time and tell us what you know. I told you. She lived next door to me. I did odd jobs for her! What kind of odd jobs? Painting, mowing the lawn. Tell him the truth, Ruben! I'm telling the truth! Tell him the truth, Ruben. This man is honest, overworked, and could be defending someone else. Shit. Just because my mom-- Ruben, how dare you speak to Jondular like that! Excuse me. Can I see you a moment? Excuse me. Spanner, you won't sell a not guilty plea to the grand jury. Why not? Because we have overwhelming evidence that incriminates him, not to mention his conflicting testimonies and a great motive. What are you getting at, Miss Hill? What I am getting at is that the boy is lying. And if he continues with his bullshit mowing the lawn crap, I'll stick with sending his ass to the gas chamber! And just how do you anticipate doing that? With fingerprints on a beer bottle? I've got the boy's semen on the woman's body. Still think your kid's innocent? Look. Face facts. The kid had the hots for his neighbor. He comes onto her. She laughs in his face and he rapes and kills her. Case closed. Now, save yourself before he makes a fool out of you. We'll expect a change of plea from your office in two hours. Two hours? Two hours. Whether you know it or not, my name goes in for assistant DA today, and I don't need any lousy pro bono lawyers screwing up my chances. And by the way, William, once I'm assistant DA, I could make life very pleasant or quite miserable for you. I think you better be nice to me while you still can, huh? Mama, I don't care what they found out. I didn't kill Gloria. Mama, tell him I didn't kill Gloria. Ruben, we're here to help you. If ever there was a time to open up and talk, it's now. I don't know what happened to her, but I wasn't there to help her. Were you having an affair with Mrs. Simpson? I was in love with her. Ruben, she was 15 years older than. So what? I was in love with her and she was in love with me. Oh! I'm telling you, Vivian, the boy's innocent. Oh really? Am I supposed to believe this because you say so? No, but look. I'm gonna need some more time. Out of the question. You have already wasted three weeks on this case, and the only thing you've accomplished is getting on my nerves. Now, I gave you two hours to bring me a change of plea. So talk to me. Are you pleading insanity or what? You have less than 10 minutes. Is it possible that your political ambitions are clouding your judgment just do a little bit? We're talking about a boy's life here! 9 minutes. Thanks. Well? Nice. Just nice? Well, nice great. It certainly looks better on you than on that dummy. Ooh, you're such a flatterer. I'll have you know I just sold 40 pieces to Nordstrom's. Oh. Hey, that's great. And guess what else? What? My friend Joan wore one of my dresses to a party Saturday night. And this guy loved it. Turns out he's a buyer from-- New York? Yeah. But from where? Uh, Vindell's. You have a crystal ball or something? No. Just a very talented girlfriend. Oh yeah? Whatever happened to being someone's lover, or fiance, or wife? Joe, would you please get my significant other a glass of champagne? No, not really. Gotta go. Where you going? I have to go to a meeting. Yeah? I thought we were gonna spend the evening together. I know. I'm sorry. It's just that they're going back to New York tomorrow and it's the only time they can see me. Go ahead. Don't look like that. Things are starting to take off for me. They're buying my designs. Be happy for me. I am. You know I am. I dunno what time I'll be home, but there's some chicken in the fridge, OK? OK. Mwah. See you. Bye. -Good luck. Bye, Joe. She has a nice way of breaking a date. It wasn't really a date. She's becoming a successful business woman. Seems that way. How about you? No, I don't think I could call myself a successful business woman. Would you like another? Sure. Why not? I'm Anna Lawrence. William Spanner. Joe, would you mind giving the lady and myself another lift? Lift? Lift to the spirit. Ooh, I like that. What are you doing here? Anna, I'm talking to you. Leave me alone. What? You're back to picking up guys in bars again, are you, uh? It's over, Carl. You're not the man of my dreams, OK? What? You think that's cute? You're a fucking bitch, you know that? Oh, is that why you wanna be with me so much? Because I'm a fucking bitch? Yeah, and you're coming with me. Carl, stop it. You're hurting me! Hey. Hey, we were just having a-- Hey, look. You stay the fuck out of it or I'll fuck up your face! Just come on. No, Carl, stop it. Just come-- you're gonna come home with me! Don't do that. You're an asshole. You're both a couple of assholes and she's not worth it. Stupid bitch. You OK? Yeah, I'm OK. Thanks. Thank you. Sure. What are men for anyway? Sometimes I wonder. Don't leave. I think I'd better go. Nah. Let him cool off. I wasn't running to him. Well, then there's no reason for you to leave so soon then. You're in good company, right? Right. -Well-- -Come on. Let me buy you both a drink. I guess so. OK. I studied law for one very long semester. I just couldn't take it seriously. All that "and justice for all?" Come on. Who are we kidding, William? It has its merits. I think he means, its rewards. You don't look like you're hurting too badly. Baseball has been very, very good to me. Baseball? It thought you said you were in real estate. It's a joke, Billy boy. I sell real estate and I bet on baseball. I've never been to a baseball game. Really? Yeah. Neither have the teams I've been betting on. Can we get another round, please? No, sorry. I've got to get going. Uh, no way, Billy boy. Well, at least let me pay half. My treat. I gotta keep the lady company. No, I better be going too. Well, OK. How about I walk you home. For safety's sake. OK. Sure. Why not? I'm over 21. And this is the roof. See, Mr. Damonelli? There is no boogey man. What's over there? There's more roof. Oh. Really? Maybe we should go downstairs? I kinda like it up here. You frightened me. I am sorry. I needed to speak with you. I'm sorry I came so late. That's all right. Is Ruben OK? Mr. Spanner, Ruben is innocent. I know that. And I know that the truth will emerge. The key is the deceased woman's husband. And how do you know that? It does not really matter. What I must have is your word that you will pursue this man. Sure. Fine. You have my word. Good. I sense an inner force about you. You are more than you seem. Good night, Jondular. Be careful. There are those around you would do you harm. OK. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. So how did you get my address? Hi. Hi. You ordered champagne? Mhm. To Vindell's. They just bought my whole line. Oh, that's great. Congratulations. You're late. Did you have fun? Yeah, I met some guy for dinner and drinks. Did you miss me? Always. Where'd you get that? In the attic in your old trunk. Take it off. Take it off! I don't ever want you looking through my things again. Do you understand me? -What is the matter? Do you hear me? Yes, I hear you. Would you care to explain? I'm sorry. I-- I overreacted. It's just that some things are personal. That's all. Personal? From me? Will, I love you. I want us to have a child. What is your problem? You're pressuring me. I don't like it. Will, we have been living together for four years. I don't see what the difference would be if we got married and had a child. It's your childhood, isn't it? Charlotte. That necklace was your mother's. Stop it. You never talk about her. You'd never talk about your father. Talk to me. I can't. [shriek] [shriek] [screaming] [shriek] [screaming] [shriek] Oh, you look beautiful. That's good. All right. Keep it moving. Looks great. Little powder there. Beautiful. Light check. Beautiful. Eyes down just a little bit. That's it. Nice and soft. Little bit of a smile there. OK. That's great. That's very nice. That's it. Keep it moving. Beautiful. -OK. Bring your hands a little bit up to your face. Hold on. Hold on. OK. Beautiful. That's very nice. Ted, I need a few in this. What do you think of this? I love it. It's very nice. And, Jiji, maybe you can put her hair up a little bit and some hanging down? Yeah, I like that. Hi. Hi. Is Billy boy around? Billy boy? William? Oh. I'm sorry. I've got a lot on my mind today. I understand. So? So? So is he here? Oh god. What's wrong with me? No, he's not here. Can I take a message? Uh, I think he left this at dinner last night. Thank you. That's very nice. That's a very beautiful blouse. I really like the embroidery and the color. Very sophisticated. Thank you. Where'd you find it? Milan, Paris? No. Actually, I designed it myself. A designer? Wow. I'm impressed. Louis. Louis Damonelli. Charlotte Messina. You know, it's very nice to meet a gentleman these days. Charlotte, this isn't working. You need an outfit change here. OK. I'll be right there. I'm sorry. I'm right in the middle of a photoshoot. Really? I used to be a fashion photographer. Would you mind if I watched? Hmm. I won't say anything. Promise. No promises. Maybe you can help us out. OK. Come on in. I dunno. I think this needs something. Maybe your hair up? What do you think, Jiji? Yeah, we could try that. It's missing something. What about this? It's great. I love it. Let's shoot this. Great. Let's go for it. Beautiful. Keep on smiling. Very nice. That's it. Great. Beautiful. Great. 30 rolls of film. Very nice working. Thanks. Thanks. Bye bye. Take it easy, Charlotte. I'll talk to you later. Bye bye. Oh. What do you think? Very beautiful. Classy walk. Nice legs. I meant the dress. I'll take it. How much do I owe you? I don't usually sell my samples. But you were so much help today. Why don't you just consider it a gift. You're ruining a sale. That's OK. And besides, you brought the wallet back. Glad I did. Well, would you like some lunch? Yeah, that'd be great. Would you like some help in the kitchen? No, but you can keep me company. My pleasure. Miss Hill, may I have a word with you, please? It's a little late, Spanner. We'll just have to wait for the grand jury hearing. Now, that's not true. I just checked. You haven't contacted them yet. I thought that you and Ruben Carter would make the right decision. Obviously, I was mistaken. What's the story on the woman's husband? I hear that there is an extensive history of domestic violence in that family. As a matter of fact, I hear there's a case pending against him right now. You hear? What kind of a defense is that? I don't have quite the resources you have. William, I don't wanna be rude, but I think you're in over your head. I'm just trying to save the boy's life. You have something against that? The husband is not a suspect, so you better change your theory. Why not? Because he was out of town on the night in question. He returned last night. The police questioned him and he was not held. You look surprised. No, just screwed. Yeah. Because you can't save another poor ghetto kid who's unjustly accused. Well, I'm sick of it. Do me favor, Spanner. Stop wasting my time, the taxpayers' money, and let justice be served before the little bastard is out on the street to kill again. Wow. Just what I needed. Louis, why don't we go and pay this babe a visit? No. Why not? She let you in the house. Not yet. When? When I say so. I'm starting to feel bad. I need some. All right, baby. All right. Hello, Louis. Billy boy. Good to see you again. This is Roxy. Nice to meet you, Roxy. Why don't you sit down? No, I can't. I can't stay. I just wanted to thank Louis for returning my wallet. Well, you're welcome. Oh, come on, William. You're too handsome to go home yet. Is she always like this? You'll get used to it. Come on. Join us for a drink. OK but only if it's on me this time. I hope you can afford it. I have a very healthy appetite. Well, I'll leave my car keys as collateral. Are you OK? Is something wrong? No. No, nothing I can't handle. That sounds serious. Why don't you tell us about it? Well, I'm working on a case. Are you a private detective? No. No, I'm an attorney. Oh, you're a lawyer. That's really cool. Roxy. So what's the problem? Well, her name's Vivian Hill. She's a prosecuting attorney, and if you know what a bitch is, Ms. Hill is the mother of them all. Billy boy, you need to get her barred from the halls of justice. Right now, she's treating you like an incompetent. And the only way to stop a ball-breaking bitch like that is to string her up by her toes and give her 50 lashes. Then she'll respect you. Maybe you should have a different kind of talk with her. What kind of talk is that? Go for it. Tell her what a bitch you really think she is. You gotta get these things off your chest. What have you got to lose? He's right. Do it. It will make you feel better. Maybe you're right. What do you want? I wanna talk to you. This isn't the time or the place. Drive. Look, I'm in a rush. So go. [car engine revs] All right. I've heard enough. Now look. You've had too much to drink, and I think you'd better get out of here before you say something you're really going to be sorry about later. You couldn't care less about that kid, could you? All you really care about is your lousy career! Get out of my car. No, I'm not finished yet. Your entire case is built on circumstantial evidence. And that's not fair to that kid. So tomorrow I'm go to the grand jury and I'm going to request a stay until I'm satisfied that every piece of evidence has been investigated. You know, you are so full of shit. And if you think your compassion can camouflage your incompetence, you're wrong. You know, Vivian, the truly sad thing is, is you're trying to rack up points convicting people whether they're innocent or guilty. You're a ruthless, ambitious-- That's it. That is it. Now, either you get out of my car right now, or I'm going to bring up so many charges against you that the only law you'll be practicing is as a court bailiff! Vivian! Oh god! Call an ambulance! She stood right in front of the car. What the hell were you doing? You should have seen her! But we didn't. I'm sorry. She's alive. She'll be fine. That's the way you wanted it anyway. Isn't it? What are you? Crazy? OK, let's not stand around here arguing all night. I'm cold. And I don't feel so well. Billy boy, go on home. We'll take care of this. You can't afford to get yourself caught up in this mess. I can't just leave. She's badly injured. Don't be a jerk. This could ruin your whole career. I'm not really worried about my career right now! William, you had nothing to do with this. There's no reason for you to stay here. So why don't you just leave, OK? We'll take her to the hospital. Don't worry. We'll keep your name out of it. But it's my fault. It wasn't your fault. Get out of here before the police comes. Where am I? You're with me. [screaming] Where have you been? Did you eat? Yeah. What's the matter? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Are you OK? It's nothing, Charlotte. I had a long day. I lost a case. That Ruben Carter case? No, another one. I'm sorry. Did you want me to make you something? No, I'm just going up to bed. I'm sorry I'm late. OK. Let's get this over with. There has been a postponement. Postponement? Why? Miss Hill never arrived. I'll go check it out. Wait here. Her office has not heard from her since yesterday afternoon. Are you all right? Something seems to be troubling you. Come and speak to me any time that you like. Perhaps I can help you. Hi. Hi. I didn't see William's car. Is he here? He went to the office. He said he'd be back in a couple hours and I should wait. OK. LOUIS: Hot day, isn't it? Yeah. LOUIS: Would you like a cool drink? Yeah, that'd be nice. Thanks. Would you excuse me for a minute? Sure. Make yourself at home. Oh. I'm sorry, Charlotte. I didn't know that you were dressing. Here. Thank you. Louis, uh-- Oh. Sure, OK. William's one helluva lucky guy. You're a very beautiful woman, you know that? Would you excuse me? Sure, OK. Is this one of yours? Mhm. Would you try it on for me? Sure. Joe, say, have you seen Louis and Roxy around? Who? The couple that I was sitting with last night. Louis told me he knew you from the Navy. Me? I was never in the Navy. Louis? Louis? Pretty picture. Oh. I thought you'd gone. Never. I shouldn't say that? It was nice to hear. No. You shouldn't. All that's fading? No. A little. No, we shouldn't do this. What the fuck are you doing? Will, it happened so fast-- Get the fuck outta my house! Get outta my house now! Calm down, Billy boy. It was just a little kiss. Will, you're overreacting. I wanna talk to you outside. See you later, beautiful. I don't want you ever talking to her again, you understand me? I thought you two weren't getting along. Where's Vivian? She didn't make it. What? She died on the way to the hospital. Sorry, Billy boy. Sorry? What the hell's that supposed to be mean? A woman is dead! What did you tell the police? Nothing. We buried her. You what? I thought it would be the best thing for all of us, especially you, Billy boy. Roxy? She was very upset about all of it. She wanted to go to the police. But I said, we're your friends. We can't betray you. Remember. Don't forget to wash the blood off your collar. See you later. We gotta face the truth. Things just aren't working out. And this thing, this attraction to Louis, would have never happened if things were right between us. You stay away from him. I don't wanna have a relationship with Louis. It's just that he made me feel good. He made me feel wanted, adored a little. Damn it! You stay away from him! What's with you and him? He's dangerous. I mean it. I don't want you to have anything to do with him. I'm sick and tired of trying to help you. I have begged you to go to therapy. I offered to go with you. You have just gone from cold to crazy. I'm going to my father's. I'm involved in a death. Louis wants to call it an accident, but the more I think about it, the more it looks like murder. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. What do you think? I think you should go to the police and tell them everything. I can't do that. There's no body. Besides, Roxy'd just fabricate some story and tell the police that I was the one driving. I mean, it was my car, and everybody knew that Vivian and I were adversaries. Let's face it. I've got a perfect motive for killing her. I couldn't stand the woman. Well, you sound more like an attorney than someone who's concerned about a woman's death. Hey, what about us? I don't know, William. You tell me. I want us to be together. I want it to work for us. I just don't know how yet. I've gotta get this mess cleared up before I can think straight. I'm glad your staying at your father's. Maybe I should stay. No. I don't want you to be anywhere where he could find you. I don't know what he's capable of. Sorry I'm late. I spent the past several hours down at the police station. Apparently, they finally brought in the deceased woman's husband. And his alibis didn't check out, so when they tried to requisition him, he attempted to flee. And? He confessed. Ruben, you've been completely exonerated. Thank the spirits! Oh, I knew my boy was innocent! Thank you, Mr. Spanner. You see what faith can do for you, my son? Something's troubling you, Mr. Spanner. Why don't you go and talk with Jondular? he's a good man, a wise man. Maybe I will. I'm a man of the law and yet I just don't know how to proceed. That's because you see no logic in the way he behaves. That's true. And you never will. He thrives on destroying lives, on possessing people, especially women. William, Vivian is dead and this-- this man has pulled you into his web of evil. There are not many forces on this Earth capable of stopping a creature like him. But I believe that you can. What do you mean? Come with me. I know that you have spent most of your life avoiding your past, things that you would prefer to forget. You and your lady friend are in extreme danger! He wants her, and you must fight back or you will lose her forever and will prevail again. See the truth for yourself! What am I supposed to do with this? Use your gifts to see beyond. Close your eyes. Now concentrate. Look into Louis's mind. [non-english speech] Oh my god oh my god. Oh my god! Who is he? What is he? In Africa, we call them labulamondi. Every culture has its own name. He was human once. He is not easily stopped. You have the power to stop him! You, the son of your father! No! No, I swore I'd never use those powers again-- never! He was a warlock. Who handed down the pottential for great power to his son! He killed my mother. He killed her! I swore I'd never be like him. He wants your woman. These are very romantic creatures. They enslave their prey by releasing their poisonous, inhuman blood into their bodies. But they soon grow tired of these companions. And then they take another. He'll never find her. She's safe where she is. William. You leave me alone! You cannot hide from him! Hello, Mr. Messina. It's William. Fine, thanks. Is Charlotte there? Where did she go? Oh. OK. No, no. Everything's fine. Yeah, just have her call me as soon as she gets in. OK. Thanks. Bye. He promised me a child. Bad dreams, Billy boy? You son of a bitch! Better be careful. You might get hurt around here. Look what I found. Great stuff, huh? Hi, William. Where's your girlfriend? You'll never lay eyes on her. Gee, you seem real angry. He's not angry. He's our friend. I am not your friend! Really? That's funny. I feel a certain brotherhood with you. God, this stuff is awful. And she thinks she's a designer. Get out of my house, both of you! What's wrong? Did your little voodoo friend scare you? Get out of my life, you bastard! [phone ringing] Hello? CHARLOTTE (ON PHONE): Hi. Oh, Charlotte. I'm so glad you're OK. You sound terrible. Is everything OK? You're right about me. You've always been right. I've been running away from my past, but I can't do it anymore. I've gotta fight back! What are you talking about, Will? Look, I'm coming home. No! Absolutely not. Listen. I've got a lot of things I need to tell you, things I wanna tell you now. But there's some things I've gotta do first, OK? Just know that I love you. Please, know that. I do. WILLIAM (ON PHONE): OK. I love you. Jondular? Jondular? Jondular? He knew of his destiny. He was not afraid. He would not want you to be afraid either. He left this with me for you. He was gonna help me. He was gonna show me how to stop him. Come help me. Then I will help you. Will? Jondular had his fears too, so he always listened to what was in his heart. He said that was the key to spiritual power, the heart. Cherish a good man's heart but destroy an evil man's. Look into your heart, Mr. Spanner, and see what Jondular saw in you. He knew you were special. It is time for you to see for yourself and accept who you are. Let Jondular's spirit guide you. And don't be afraid. Let me see into Louis's soul. Show me how to stop him. [moaning] Welcome. Charlotte! Oh my god. [moaning] [horn beeps] No, Louis. I've been waiting for you. No. Let's finish. Please? Shut up! Louis. Let me go. You're so beautiful. Louis, please don't. Relax. I'm a wonderful lover. You'll see. Louis, Louis. Yes. What's going on? What do you think's going on? She can't ever love you like I can. Is that right? Is that right, Charlotte? Tell me what I am to you. You're my life. Oh, how sweet. How sweet. I want to be with you forever. How sweet. Oh god. What do you want from me? Everything you have. Please, let me go. There's nothing more important than the life that I loved. You're the perfect woman for me. Together, we will share eternity. Relax, Charlotte. I don't wanna hurt you. No! Oh, Charlotte. Honey? He-- He doesn't know who he's dealing with. You're a little late, Billy boy. She needs me now. Look at her. Look at her. What did you do to her? I made her mine. Fuck! Just who are you, Billy Boy? I don't think you wanna know. [screaming] I think you've met your match, Louis! Charlotte! Charlotte! Charlotte! Give it to me! Give it to me. Give it to me. Give it to me! You still wanna know who I am? [screaming] It's over, baby. It's over. Charlotte, Charlotte? No. Oh god. Oh, Will. Oh god. I'm never gonna let you go. Will, are you sure we're doing the right thing? There's nothing else we can do. You think anybody'd believe us if we told the truth? We'd just ruin our lives. What about you? I feel whole now. I don't have that fear that my strength comes from evil anymore. It's definitely the goodness of my heart. Do you believe me? I do. That's all that matters to me. Thank god that's over. Let's get the hell outta here. Can't forget this. [screaming] No, no, no, no! [screaming] Are you OK? Are you OK? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey. It's OK. Let's go. Let's get outta here. And my name's not Billy boy. [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): Damn what the hell was that? Damn, what the hell was that?
