Smoking and drinking are injurious to health. Smoking and drinking are injurious to health. (Typing sound) Okay, Sir. Captain Arjun Pandit, who went to NSG on deputation, from Kunwara Army Regiment... We have evidence that,... ...you said you won't take orders. 'I don't take the orders, anymore, Sir.' 'If you want you can court martial me.' We need not tell you, what a big crime... ...it is, to reject orders. In the case of Khaji Baba without even informing your superiors, you took own... ...decisions, and because of this, we lost some lives. What happened? The special status, given by Article 370 and 35a to Jammu Kashmir... ...was changed fitly by Pakistan. It enraged religious violence and tried to divide our country. With a slogan, 'Azaad Kashmir', it called on to separate Kashmir from India. 'Kashmir warriors are not afraid of death.' 'Because they are muslims.' - The then Pakistan Prime Minister,... ...Benazir Bhutto, fully supported the terrorist actions, and supplied weapons. In Srinagar, at Lal Chowk, Pakistani supporters gave slogans against India. In a famous newspaper, they advertised and killed pandits who didn't leave Kashmir. Without considering ladies, pregnant, children, they massacred many. Even now, there is no count as how many were killed. More than three lakh Kashmiri pandits left Kashmir, with fear of death. Even now, people of our country are living as refugees in our country. The terrorist group that was born at that time is... ...Harkat-ul Jihad-al Kashmir. The horrible terrorist, who caused holocaust, through this is... ...Shah Nawaz Khan, alias, Ghazi Baba. (Urdu Language) The blood of Mujahiddin and Ghazi is flowing in the veins of Kashmiris. What will reign here? - Muslims reign. Who will rule this land? - Muslims will rule. Kashmir should change to Pakistan. Kashmir Pandits should leave this place, but their ladies should be here. Hey, Kashmiri Pandit... Oh, God. You don't change your religion, right? Then die. Jihad. - Jihad. Jihad. - Jihad. (Camera sound) Who's is Kashmir? - Pakistan. What do we want? - Freedom. Hey Indian dogs, run away. (Gun fire) Stop. Hey. - Oh. Hey. Take this. Hey, Rahul Pandit. You are a journalist, right? Do you want to publish our photo? Do you want to write about us? Then go ahead. For Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Hindus, we are giving three options. If you change to our religion, you will live. Leave Kashmir and go away. Or else, you will die. Hey Pandit, you will die. You Pakistani can kill Kashmiris. But you can't change history. We will change and show it, Pandit. We will show the change. Kashmir will becomes Pakistan's. We, Mujahuddin are here. We will infiltrate into each house. We will search and kill. Only one thing from every village, that is freedom. Every muslim will give slogan for freedom. Each and every children will wish for freedom. Freedom. You people are spoiling your path, in the name of jihad. Stop it, Pandit. Stop thinking and thoughts. Earthquake came in Kashmir, because of other religious people in Kashmir. That's why Mujahuddin entered the field. You turn yourself into ours. Or else, you will die, Pandit. That's fine, Khaji, listen. Kashmir is our mother. We will not go anywhere, leaving this place. Every Indian is with Kashmir. We are not living here, we are bearing. Look here. I am a devotee of Lord Siva. Every Hindu of Kashmir will say one word. - What? If you try to occupy us, beware. We, Kashmiris are ready. Pandit, go and save your family first. Wewill see you later. Go run. Run. Saraswathi, run. Saraswathi, Saraswathi. Saraswathi. Sara. 'Kashmir warriors are not afraid of death. Because they are Muslims.' 'In the nerves of Kashmiris flows the blood of Mujahids and Ghazis.' 'In the nerves of Kashmiris flows the blood of Mujahids and Ghazis.' (Radio sound) (Radio sound) (Radio sound) (Radio sound) (Radio sound) Come. Leave me. - Leave. Leave. - Leave my husband. Saraswathi, you run. - We will leave Kashmir. Saraswathi, run. - We will leave Kashmir. Saraswathi, listen to me. Go away. Go away. Leave. 'Ghazibaba, behind th massacre of Kashmiri Pandits...' '...should be handed over to India.' 'This was request by Indian PM to Pakistan PM.' Ghazi Baba is not a terrorist, he is a hero fighting for freedom...' '..this statement was given by Masood Azhar, in Karachi.' (Typing sound) (Phone sound) (Phone sound) (Phone sound) Hello. - Sir, this is Captain Arjun speaking. It's an emergency, Sir. Tell me, Arjun. - Border crossed line, Sir. When we knew he isn't in POK, we knew that he started from Karachi to Hyderabad, Sir. When? - He reached Karachi day before evening. From there he is coming to Hyderabad, Sir. He is planning something big in Hyderabad, Sir. Is this information correct? This matter came out when ISI General, Zubair Khan's phone was being intercepted. Okay. Where are you? Okay, send me the coordinates. Yeah, I will be online. Keep me posted. Sir. - Sir. Principal Secretary started from PMO. They will be here in five minutes. Did Anish tell about the matter? - No, Sir. Hi, Anish. - Yes, Sir. Sit, sit. - Thank you. You are a retired person from army, man. Why do you bother? We don't bother just like that, Sir. What is the matter? - Ghazi Baba. (Car sound) (Gun shot) (Gun shot) Hey. (Gun shots) (Monitor switched off) Arjun Pandit, Kashmiri. (Laughs) I think you tried hard to catch me. Our enmity is more than the enmity between countries. Right? Run, Saraswathi, run. Run, Saraswathi. Saraswathi. Arjun, stay here. (Door closed) Hey. (Kicks) Arjun, don't fall in his trap. Don't get provoked. This is an international issue, Arjun. Don't terminate the target, Arjun. Are you waiting for the orders, Arjun? 'Don't listen to him, Arjun.' Arjun, listen to me. God, damn it. Arjun. Put your gun down. I am warning you. This is a direct order. You are looking at a court marshall here. Arjun, Arjun. This is not personal. You are a soldier. Go, Arjun. Oh, shit. Move. Jail is little smaller. But still, it is fine. This is larger than your grave. This is more for you. (Typing sound) Where is Faruq? Ghazi Baba was caught. Indian government didn't declare it officially, Faruq. We didn't know where Ghazi Baba was kept. Ghazi Baba was caught in Hyderabad. What should we do now, Faruq? What are you thinking, Faruq? - Kashmir is an international issue. We, somehow, should force... ...Indian External Affairs Minister. The work will be done. That Sharma? He is an RSS, Faruq. Nothing will happen. He will not even care his life. Tural, everybody has valuable thing than his life. Enquire what it is. Tell me, Sir. You are frustrated. You are doing wrong, you are escaping. You came from Delhi to say this, right? Hmm. Why did you apply for leave? It took years to trace Ghazi Baba, Sir. He was at my gunpoint, my finger was on trigger, just one order. I waited for just one order, Sir. But you asked me to leave him. In the process of capturing Ghazi Baba... ...eight of the commandos lost their lives. Bloody international cause. Do you know why I joined army, Sir? In my childhood, in Kashmir valley,... ...the only saviours, I know, were Indian Army soldiers. I gave Ghazi Baba, Sir. Take him. Feed him. I am done. Are we done? No, Arjun. Killing Ghazi Baba is not a big achievement. One more Ghazi Baba will be born. What we have to kill is... ...their thought process,... ...anti-India ideology. Do you think we are done? Yes, Sir. I agree. We are in the middle of the battle. But did you understand one thing? Since Ghazi Baba is with us... ...all his sleeper cells in India will be active. To free Ghazi Baba... ...we can't imagine what destruction they would do and... ...how many innocents would they kill. Are you understanding, how big this problem is? Are you understanding? Our country has been searching for Ghazi Baba for years. In a situation where even Intelligence couldn't trace... ...you followed his every move... ...and you detected that he is coming to Hyderabad. You caught Ghazi Baba. You, who knows how and what Ghazi Baba thinks... ...after he is caught... ...are planning to leave this operation... ...do you understand, how dangerous this could be? This only chance which could give relief to Kashmiri Pandits... ...if you leave in between... ...do you understand, how that pain would be? (Typing Sound) Morning, Sir. - Morning. Morning, Sir. Since Ghazi Baba has been captured till now, anything suspicious? Process is on, Sir. We tracked one suspicious email id. But there is no information, Sir. - Then? Surprisingly, it was opened in 26 different cities, like.. ...Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta. And it's still going on. (Screen swipe sound) (Screen sound) (Screen sound) See, Sir. It's opened in Ahmedabad. Without any information, why are they opening this email... ...and how they are opening, is very surprising, Sir. What could it be? They must be passing on the password. Probably, yes. It's Dal lake, right? Yes, Sir. Very nice wallpaper. Sorry, Sir. Download it. Sir? - Download the wallpaper. Mr. Srinu Pillai, download the wallpaper immediately. What is the late? Sir, unless there is data attached with it... ...it will not take this long, Sir. He is right, Sir. Sir, it's an encrypted file. Can we decript it? - Yes, Sir. Make it fast. (Access denied) Oh. (Keyboard sound) (Access Granted) - Ha. It's in the binary code, Sir. Decode it. - Okay, Sir. (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Alphabet displayed sound) (Gold fish not in Simla waters) Gold fish is not in Simla waters? What is this, Sir? Just check what's going on in Simla. VIP meetings, MLA, MP moments, enquire about anything and everything. Hurry up. - Okay, Sir. Sir, there are no VIP meetings there. Not just that, no minister is going there. There are no party meetings till next month. Minister's daughter is studying in Simla. - What? Minister Sharma's daughter is studying in Simla University, Sir. She is the gold fish. It was good that your daughter was not in Simla. It was a narrow escape. At the time of her mother's death, she was a small kid, Anish. Poor girl, she grew without mother's love. If she is not in a good mood, she just goes away, to roam. So, her same habbit saved her. It's better if she is kept in safe house. - No, no. She is a free bird, Anish. Because of my political reasons, it's not correct to disturb her... ...freedom and happiness. And, we can't ignore Intelligence reports, as well. What if we send her somewhere abroad? It might be a little risk. They will trace her out very easily. Yeah, yeah. I forgot about that. Then, without disturbing her freedom... ...without troubling her and fulfilling our security reasons... ...just come out with some other alternative plan. Can you? (Operation Gold Fish) (Gun shots) (Gun shot) (Typing sound) (Ghazi Baba caught atlast) (Cricket commentary) (Cricket commentary) (Cricket commentary) Hello. What did you do in Gachibowli, yesterday evening? Yesterday evening, Gachibowli? - Yes. I didn't go to Gachibowli. - I will kick you, rascal. Give me that. - Don't lie in the morning itself. You went there. When traffic constable held you, as you didn't have license... ...you escaped saying that you are my son. Traffic SI called me and told this. Siva, why are scolding in the morning? You shut up. I am asking him. You tell me. Tell him. - I didn't go, daddy. May be it's that Solemn. You idiot. If they are caught, did you tell all your friends to say I am the father? In department, they will wonder as, how many wives I have. This is too much. I am more for you. And wives for you and discussion on it. What is your dad? That idiot for this idiot. (Michael Jackson Music) (Glass breaks) (Michael Jackson Music) (Michael Jackson Music) (Michael Jackson Music) (Michael Jackson Music) Hey. Hey, what have you done? What is this? I am asking you. Nothing, dad. Oh, Jesus. When you both parked car at 'No Parking',... ...traffic police came and bracketed the wheel, it seems. After that, when they saw, the car was not there. How did you guys drive it? (Laughs) Oh. (Humming) What? What is this? What is he doing in the dicky? Hey. - Thank God. Who are you? It's me, second floor, CI Raju's son, Karthik Raju. Karthik Raju. See, how I recognised you? By the way, who am I? You. We're dying of your forgetfulness. You are the watchman of this appartment. Hey, didn't your tubelight glow yet? That's what I can't remember, boss. If I sleep in the dicky, I can't find difference between day and night. It's so warm there, you know? It will be. You will be happy. You sleep in the dicky like this. Owner will come and drive the car away. Bad will be gone. You know, my father scolds you daily. - Even my father does that. I told you, right? It's that girl. What? Her? - Excuse me. How do I go to Administrative office? You can go anyways, Sir. Take straight, then left... Go straight, take right and go straight. Direct Administrative office. You need not ask anyone. Sir, the whole staff will be there. Thank you. Come. Let's go to the class. After right, straight. Sir, the whole staff will be there. (Smiles) I forgot to pay library fees. I will go and pay. You go to class. - Okay, come fast. Additional Director General, Anish Kurivilla informed that you're here. External Affairs Minister, Mr. Sharma's daughter joined your campus today. Is it? In our admission records... - In your admission records... ...her true identity was not disclosed. She has a threat. She will be like any other normal student in the college. No one knows that there is security in campus. Most important. Her true identity should not be disclosed to anyone in the campus. If she tells her friends that she is Minister's daughter? She will not reveal to anyone, who she is. Oh, Sudha, right? - Hey, you. You leave. Come here. What's your name? Tanya, Sir. - Where are you from? Delhi. - This sweet heart is from Delhi. Which branch? - CsEC. Customer service, man. Will you do the services properly? Tell us. Keep the book on your head and dance. She is dancing very well, man. Do it. Hey, fake. Come here. See, he is a wrestler, man. Hey, stupid. - We will see him. He is coming like a hero. I will show him. What? Are you fresher? Yeah. - What's your name? Tanya, Sir. Leave her to me. You come. Hey, hey. - You come. Who is he? We never saw him in campus. Don't know. May be he is senior. I am Karthik. I am also a fresher. Too much. Don't turn back. Come fast. Hi. Hi. Hey. He started it. Hey, come. Sit here. Oh, not me? Did you see? - Move. Yeah. - He was seeing and... Will you wave hands when you see a girl? We lost our dignity. Idiot. Karthik, my hostelmate, Nitya. Hi. - Hi. We stay in same room. He is Salmon, my friend. - Hi. Hi. - Nice to meet you. You are so cute. Your smile... Nitya. - Hi. Nice to meet you. Why is she doing too much? You know what? These two are... Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. Sit down. Why did he come here? - He is old man. What's wrong with them? You idiot. I am booked for what you have done. What did I do, man? I just told him where staff would be. - Shut up. (Coughs) Stand up, stand up. Here. This over action is not needed. Head up, head up. I don't know anything, Sir. It was he... Actually, I didn't know that you are a professor. If I am not a professor... ...if anyone on the road asks for address... ...will you send them directly to graveyard? (Laughs) Shut up. Don't give such smiles. Your head down. Idiots. Since professor was good, he left him. We were saved, you know? Ladies first. You are new to this. But you will get used to it. Take it light, man. - You guys are so fun. Whose idea is to send him to graveyard? Mischievous idiot. Idiots? Why did she say that? Actually, she likes pranks. That's what she meant. Oh. - Yeah. It was my idea. Alright, guys. You have everything in this canteen. What do you want to have? I want a coke. - For you? Coke. - Okay. Coke. Okay. - Don't forget. Coke for me, too. Do one thing. 3 cokes and 1 tea. Get it. Go, man. - You. Go, baby. Go, man. - Yes, going. He is over acting, seeing girls. What is it? Yes. One tea, 3 cokes. Wait for a minute. Boost, nescafe, no tea. Bra? What is that second one? - It's coffee. Oh, you gave different names. Hey, there is no tea. 3 cokes for us. Shall I say one bra for you? Hey, do you need bra or not?

Yes. - They recognised you, I guess. Corporator, it seems. What are these fights and police? Police didn't step in the campus till now. It's just been 2 days, that you joined here. What is this methodology? Without my permission... ...you can't go out of this campus. Is that clear? Sorry, Sir. - Sorry, Sir. Move. Tanya, let's go. Arjun, that's just a senior junior fight. I suspended seniors. I restricted the girl from going out of campus, without my permission. No, no. Don't restrict that girl. Let her move freely. Only then, there will be no doubts. - Are you sure? Don't worry. - Okay. Yeah. Sir, everything is taken care of. It was good that I was there. - Good job, Ismail. Special court will be confirming verdict about the punishment to Ghazi Baba. Youth in Kashmir demanding release of Ghazi Baba, threw stones on Indian Army. Kashmiri Militant Group threatened, if Ghazi Baba is not released... ...India has to face consecutions. - Uncle. What is your age? Why? If we see such news, our hair will become white, like yours. Please change the channel, uncle. Pothuraju, change that channel. Okay. - Students might kill us. Hey. - Hmm. Did our VC restrict, not to laugh at jokes? You should be like that. (Hindi song) (Hindi song) (Hindi song) - Enough. Don't shout. (Typing sound) Based on the arguments and counter arguments, presented today... ...this special court has come to the conclusion that the accused... ...Ghazi Baba, is guilty of anti-Indian conspiracy,... ...murders in Kashmir and terrorism. This special court, hereby, sentences, Ghazi Baba... ...to be hunged, until he is dead. Thank you very much, Sir. He deserves it. - Well done, young man. Thank you. Arjun. These signatures, orders can do nothing to this Ghazi Baba. These signatures, and these orders will take me and surrender to my people. This is Ghazi Baba's promise. If that happens,... ...wish that I am not there, Ghazi. Signatures or what? I will shoot you right there. This is the promise of an Indian. Ghazi Baba has been sentenced to be hanged till death, by the special court, Faruq. We are wasting time, trying for that girl. - That girl is in Hyderabad. What is this, Karthik, why are you behaving like mad? Guys, this is too much. They are doing too much. - Yes. Yes. - (Hindi song) I am good than any other one. Yes, you were good. You know what? - What do you need? Small or large? Come on. - Coming. (Background Music) Just check how is Nitya, in selfies. You are like a monkey. Yeah, take it. Have it. No, please. He is not drinking. Too much. He doesn't drink. He doesn't have that habit. Really? - Yes. You don't do over action. Drink it. Nothing will happen. Please. - Have it. Girl is giving you. Don't do too much. Drink it. Wait a second. You don't take advantage, after drinking, right? I am not such person. - Then it is waste of drinking, right? (Smiles) Drink, drink. Cheers. - Cheers. It will be good if you eat hot dosa, Tanya. You can order online. But if you eat here... ...that taste itself is different. - Is it? I will not give. - Just one sip, man. No. - What an attitude, man. No, I will not give. Solemn, let's play a game. What is the bet? If I lose, I will pay the total bill. If you lose,... ...give me that coke. First, tell me the rules. Simple, rules are very simple. I will ask you five questions. You should answer all questions, wrong. If you give all wrong answers, then, you win. Easy, right? Is it fair? Come on, Solemn. You can do it. - It's very simple, man. You will win. - Okay? Let's play. Ready. - Ready? Okay. India's first Prime Minister. Mahesh Babu. - Super. Oh, no. I unnecessarily asked the bet. You are a fool, right? (Smiles) He is done now. What will you say? Say it. - Yes. You are intelligent. Smart answer. - You are not a normal person. India's capital. Hey, Solemn. I was born there. Palasa. I am losing it. Shall I pay it? - You are very alert. Why late? Pay it. Pay it. - By the way how many questions did I ask? You asked three. Just two more. Super, man. Correct answer. I won the game. This coke is mine. - Oh my God. Hey, Solemn. You gave right answer for second question itself. She unnecessarily asked two extra questions. (Smiles) Chill, buddy, chill. Hey, why are you drinking like that? She is drinking my blood, man. Daily, she is eating my head, to drop her at the hostel. She is confusing me by telling this and that. She asked me to say wrong answers and robbed my coke. Hey, what robbing coke, man? Don't laugh, man. I am very irritated. All these girls are same. They are ghosts and demons. Hey. She did it just to tease you. All girls are not like that, right? For example, take Tanya. She is a sweet hearted girl. She is so cute. Yes, that's why,... ...I love Tanya. Hey, do you understand, what you are talking? Tell one reason, why you love Tanya. Don't know. But I love Tanya. Shut up, man. Are you mad? Listen to me carefully. I like Tanya. I love Tanya. (Hindi song) (Hindi song) No problem, if Tanya is not mine. But he should not get her. Please God. - What happened, son? We both loved the same girl, father. It is wrong, son. It is wrong for two guys fight for one girl. Love expects sacrifice. Even I asked him to sacrifice, father. - What? Yes. Oh, God. Forgive this child. Father. Hi Tanya. Hi. What is it? Tanya, I need to tell you something. I never chased any girl in my life. I even don't know how to propose. I like you so much. I love you, Tanya. Hey. Did you see Tanya? - No I didn't. Okay. - Okay. Hi. - Hi. How is it? What? - I mean, you are new, right? We are South India. Campus. So good. Don't go here. Don't go there. Don't do this. Don't do that. All restrictions in that campus. It's very irritating. I just want to go somewhere. Then, will you come to Khandala? What? - I mean... ...I know that you won't come. I am just saying we'll go together. How do you know that I won't come? How will you decide if I come or not? Now, tell me, where shall we go? Will you come? - Yes, let's go. Where will you take me, Karthik? I mean, you just said okay. So I will plan the trip. When shall we go? Shall we go now? It's difficult if you say now. I need little time. Okay. (Kachiguda) (Car door opens) (Background Music) Faruq Iqbal Iraqi. He is Kashmir Liberation Front commander. If this Ghazi plans, he will execute it. Where is he now? Where is Sharma's daughter? (Laughs) It's time for me, to pray. Can I leave? Arjun, we can't risk anymore. Shift that girl immediately to safe house. No, Sir. Please wait. My trap is working out. Trap? - That girl's whereabouts... ...were leaked by me to Faruq through Facebook. (Typing sound) What are you talking, Arjun? - If we have to hunt a tiger... ...we have to throw a lamb as a bait. Unless, lamb is Minister's daughter, Arjun. I said I threw a bait. I didn't say that I will sacrifice her. Faruq thought to throw gold fish as bait, and release Ghazi Baba. By throwing the same gold fish as bait... ...I brought Faruq to Hyderabad. Faruq believed, if he surrounds the hostel... ...and take that girl as hostage... ...then whole government will be in his hands. I believed that this is the best opportunity... ...to catch him. If I say this, government will not agree and superiors will not support me. That's why, I took my decisions. When I thought everything was going as per my plan... ...I got the information, where Faruq is hiding in Barkas. This is walk way. This is the main entrance. Hmmm. If we take left from here, the first one is the ladies hostel. (Door opens) (Door closes) This is the second canteen that is near ladies hostel. (Door opens) (Gun shot) Hey, down. This is ladies hostel. That girl stays here. Is there any other entrance, other than this? No. This is the only way to enter or exit. (Door sound) (Door opens) Come. Uncle gave you tea. Oh, no. (Phone rings) Hello. (Door knocks) Who's it? - Ismail. Faruq... Arjun knew that you are in Hyderabad. They attacked on the Barcus house, where you stayed. Rohit, keep tight security all over the campus. Faruq can enter the campus any time. Be alert. Now we have to be more alert. Before Arjun knows that we are in campus... ...we need that girl. Why are the cameras stuck up? Some technical problem. All cameras got spoiled. What? It's not technical problem. It's a sub torch. Faruq did this. That means... ...Faruq is in campus. Where is that girl? (Screams) (Screams) Army means trust. Trust that we will save. With that trust, this operation was given to you. But the girl in your surveillance went on a trip, without your knowledge. You wasted your time by going for Faruq to Barcus. This mission took a wrong turn there. Isn't it your failure? If I stop thinking it's a failure... ...Faruq would have been successful, Sir. I didn't stop. What Anish, you came here? Nothing, Sir. Your daughter SIM card is switched off. We are unable to connect to cell. She went on a trip with friends, it seems. Did she intimate you anything? (Smiles) Intimation. No problem. Sit down. The matter that many doesn't know is... ...it's been many years that my daughter talked to me, Anish. In that Jardham yatra, the terrorists killed my wife. She believed that due to my political reasons,... ...her mother died. From then, with me... Why? Anything serious? Should I respond as a father... ...or a Minister, I am unable to understand. Using my powers, only for my daughter... ...is not correct, as well. And, I can't leave my daughter too. To save the four of them, I am giving you all powers. Without anything happening to children, without press knowing anything... ...without leaving Ghazi Baba, finish the mission. Even the Minister doesn't know where that girl went, Arjun. Press should not know at any cost, that she is missing. We are going to hang Ghazi Baba in two days. Now, it's our responsibility to safeguard her. I will track her, Sir. ♪Wake up, wake up.

Hi. - He is so mean, yaar. Now, you understood? What? - We are suffering since childhood. You are great. - I will meet tomorrow, definitely... ...and asks if I have cool drink now. What's your name? Srinu. - He gave his drink. Whose son? - He is my son, Sir. Is it? Okay, go. Karthik, I am feeling hungry. - Idiot. You didn't give me, when I asked for it. But you gave him. I feel excited if I drink cool drink. But, if he drinks, he will be very happy. See, how happy he is. We always keep drinking. He seldom drinks it. I am feeling hungry. I will drink water and come. (Jeep door opens) (Jeep door closes) (Chintapalli Police Station) Good evening Sir. - Good evening. Did you get any information about the students? Our people are on the same work, Sir. - Why so much delay? Tourists will be trecking camps, Sir. There are about 150 trecking camps in this valley. Along with that, we have cell phone signal problem too. That is why it is getting delayed, Sir. (Screams) (Screams) Where are these two? - They went for walk in the morning. They are alone. I wonder what they must be doing. Which way did they go? Hey, Solemn. I am also coming. Wait. Why are you so worried? I said I am coming, right? Hey, you stop. (Car dicky sound) Why is it all changed? Hey, man. - Yes. Come here. What happened to the appartments here? What are you saying? This hill is like this, since my grand father's time. In which time are you in? Why does he say, which time? 'It is my job to dance in Rayulu's court.' 'Rayulu means? - Sri Krishna Deva Rayulu.' 'Oh. - Oh my God.'

By the way, how did you come here? He kept the car in the parking yesterday night. I felt cold and slept in the car dicky. When I woke up in the morning I didn't find appartments. They disappeared, boss. Fate, God. - By the way... ...where are we now? - That is a big story. Let's take a walk and talk about it. Ghazi. Hmm. Tomorrow, your death sentence has to be implemented. This is President's order. Read it once and sign it. Jihad. The end. Hmm. - What is your last wish? Kashmir's freedom... ...and India's ruination. (Gun sound) Sir, a murder happened in a tribe in the valley. Usually such crimes are not registered here, Sir. (Tribal Language) (Tribal Language) He has not seen them anywhere. He says he doesn't know. (Tribal Language) He is asking who are you and why do you want these matters. Faruq did it. How can you say that he did it? Faruq has the habit of killing people, turning their head back. Sir, it's an emergency. Yes, Gurmith. In campus, we found bodies of canteen owner and ambulance staff, Sir. Faruq must have escaped in ambulance, Sir. - In ambulance? Call ambulance. He came here in ambulance. - Sir. Ask if any ambulance is suspiciously moving in valley. Okay, Sir. - Faruq is somewhere in the surroundings. Go. Why did you plan this tour, boss? I don't understand at all. I like Tanya, man. Oh, Tanya means, this girl? She is so pretty. Good selection. Good luck. - Thank you, man. But Solemn is saying that he also loves Tanya. I thought he is a friend. He beat me so hard, man. Oh my God. What an injustice, boss! That's why I will bring Nitya close to him,... ...will propose Tanya and this is fixed. - Hi. I planned the trip for this. Super idea, boss. Give me your hand once. Kill it. - Will do it. You Karthik, I will teach you lesson. Oh. Hi. - Hi. What are you looking at? - View is too good. Yeah, super. Karthik also likes such views, you know? Really. - Yes, he likes it. You both have same taste. Karthik has very good taste. He thinks just the way you think. Nitya, I will be back right away. Hi. - Hi. Karthik. With Nitya... What is Solemn saying? Some puss, puss. - What? What puss, puss? - Yes. God knows. What is he talking to Nitya? (Background Music) I think Karthik likes Nitya. That's why he planned this trip. Karthik is just my friend, yaar. I don't have any feelings for him. I think he planned trip to propose you. - I don't agree. I will clarify your confusion. (Background Music) Karthik likes you. He is troubling a lot to say this. Karthik told me himself. He is very clear in your matter. He will bring Selmon and her together... ...and planned this trip to propose you. That is the matter. Karthik, Karthik. Wait. Let me finish this. Ha. Why are you in hurry, man? I am searching for you. Why? What happened? I need to tell you something urgently. - What did you do again? I cleared the confusion between Tanya and Nitya. What? What did you do? That you like Tanya... ...that Solemn is crawling in the middle unnecessarily... ...I told them very clearly. Then what did Tanya say? I didn't understand that. Both became dull, all of a sudden. Became dull? - Yes. You idiot. Hi. - Hi. Tanya. - When are we going back from trip? Tomorrow evening. What is this? Tanya doesn't like me or what? (Dialogues in TV) 'Madhu, take him and go away.' - 'What is it?' 'Take him away. - Explain your friend, man.' 'Explain your friend. - He is my best, man.' 'I am talking to them. - Why are you saying sorry?' 'Don't put hands, man.' 'I am telling you. We follow non-violence. No fights please.' 'He is lecturing us, man. - He is Gandhi of millennium.' 'After coming this far... - What is it?' 'Don't enrage me, please. - Is it? Will you beat me?' 'Let's fight one to one. Come.' 'If you bring this far, if I will keep sorry aside.' 'Only kicks will be remaining.' 'You say he is your close, right? Here.' 'Are you great?' 'Are you great? - Hey, man.' 'Leave him.' 'Do you know who I am?' 'Do you know Jaya aunty?' 'Do you know Lallu uncle?' 'Are you understanding? - What are you saying? Get lost.' 'Hey. - Leave.' Super idea. I can make Tanya fall for me, easily. Before going tomorrow, I have to do something. Where can I get bad boys at this time? What, boss? You became so dull? Trip is complete by today. We are leaving in the evening. The intention with which I planned the trip... ...that didn't work out. (Phone rings) Hello. Chintapalli Police Station. Is it? (Footsteps sound) You couldn't find 4 students? You are so many, here. What are you doing till now? How much longer? Sir. What is it? - We got info where those students are. Look, boss. Nitya also became dull. She is not Nitya, she is Tanya. She is Nitya and she is Tanya. You idiot. What a mess you did. Now I understood what happened. Tanya. Listen to me carefully. Listen very coolly. Okay? What actually happened is... He is the reason behind this whole confusion. (Smiles) So funny. Now, I am very happy, Karthik. (Car doors open) Where is this girl? Hey Nitya. - Why are they here? What happened? - I am coming. Wait. What's happening? - Oh, what should I do now? Leave? Hey, go away. Tanya, what's happening? What's happening, Tanya? - Hey, Nitya. Watchman confused us. - Oh, my God. Why are you so happy? Why don't you tell me as well? He will tell you. - Come. I will tell you. Come. - What's happening here? Tanya, atleast you tell me. What is it? Move. Hey. Properly. Intimate the Indian government. That, Central Minister's daughter is in our captivity. Who are you all? What Minister's daughter? We are college students. We are here on a trip. You are thinking something else. - You are thinking wrong. We are not Minister's daughters. I think you are mistaken. My dad is a businessman. Someone gave you wrong information. (Slaps) Leave, man. Tell us your father's name. Sharma. External Affairs Minister, Sharma. Come again. 'Sir Faruq kidnapped Minister's daughter.' Oh. What? 'Along with Sharma's daughter, her friends are also there.' 'Without any harm to their lives...' '...necessary actions will be taken...' 'In the guidance of his main follower, Faruq Abdul Iraqi...' '...all this happened...' '...is what Intelligence is expecting.' It's me, CI Raju, speaking. '...With this, both state's police...' What actually happened? Hey, move from here. Go there. Come on. Move. Get down. - Move. Oh. - Hey. Take them. - Karthik. Take them inside. Move. Leave me. Move. Let me go. - Move. Nitya. Move. - Nitya. Oh. Move. Where are you? - Move out. Move. Sit down. (Door closes) Sit here. Hold tight. Leave me. (Cries) Sharma, your daughter is in my captivity. I am sending you this video as a proof. Ask your government to leave Ghazi Baba. We were the ones, who killed your wife also. If you want your daughter alive... ...you speak to the government. You have to bring back our Ghazi Baba to us. Or else, your daughter also will die like your wife. (Screams) This is a sample to show how we kill her. - Just stop it. Oh. Call for a Cabinet meeting immediately. It's very urgent. Arrange it immediately. If a person is killed without our knowledge, we'll have more pain than fear. If we tell in advance... ...pain will be more than fear. That fear is Ghazi Baba's weapon. Decision that External Affairs Minister took for his daughter... ...increased our complications. I spoke to everyone. Whatever decision you take in the case of Ghazi Baba,... ...the whole cabinet will support it. Ghazi Baba, and my country. My daughter, my selfishness. Just because I am a Minister... ...they captured my daughter and demanding the release of Ghazi Baba. Or else, they can't bring this pressure. For me, my country is more important than my daughter. India first. I must resign. I am resigning. External Minister, Sharma, resigning his post has raised sensation. 'All this is for his daughter, or...' 'The complete police department became alert.' '...will take necessary action to avoid any harm...' '...said Andhra Pradesh DGP.' Hats off to him, Sir. In 1989 December... ...when Central Minister's daughter, Rubia Sahithi was kidnapped... ...the government released some terrorists. Everyone thought the same thing would happen. But nobody expected that... ...Mr. Sharma would resign. Bad luck was, till then, only his daughter was their target. But after that, the lives of others also became risky. Tanya, don't you also know that she is Minister's daughter? She never discussed her house matters with me. She always pothered that we go there, here, but... ...never a clue about it. Seeing this situation... ...Nitya was not kidnapped for money. There is much bigger issue behind this. Faruq, Minister Sharma resigned, it seems. What do we do now? How do we release Ghazi Baba now, Faruq? (Door opens) Go fast and catch them. Oh, God. Uh-oh. Come. Hide here. Hey, come. (Background Music) Sir, some people at Grass oil factory are moving with guns, it seems. Just now we got this information from tribes. Oh my God. - No, Karthik. Oh, my. - Look here, Tanya. Tanya, slowly. Tanya, hey. Bear a little, Tanya. Bend. I will take you. Please. - They will come. Hey. - Come on, guys. Come, guys. - Let's go. Come. - Let's go. (Sighs) Come. Karthik, we can hide there. Let's go there. - Go, go. Let's hide. Over there. Alert all the check posts. Is that clear? Careful. Where is this Charas smell from? Some tourists must have taken it. (Iron sound) It's clear. Let's move. Please, please. Please, please. Move. Go, go. Hey, go. Silent. (Gun shot) Hey. Oh. - Hey. Hey.

Everyone was thinking about the one life that was lost... ...but I was thinking how to protect the remaining lives. Four lives in his hands. I have six hours. Your worried face shows that Faruq is still attacking. Am I right? How do you kill the lives of innocents, so easily? (Laughs) Anish, in a war, the value of winning is more when compared to the value of life. War on what? War on whom? On the political decision in 1947, which divided India into two parts? On the compensation of 750 million that India gave to stabilise separate Pakistan? Or on the Jammu Kashmir people who still wants Kashmir to be in India? War on whom? Against India. The motivation of our religion is just one. Only one religion should remain in whole India. That too, only ours. Live like us... ...or else die like a cow. Disgusting. In your country, without teaching the children how to love... ...you are teaching them how to hate. You are giving them guns. You are asking to kill or be killed. What did your religion, your motive achieve in your country? 70 years back, the part that was occupied by you in Kashmir... ...is recognised by the world as Pakistan occupied Kashmir... ...but not like Kashmir in Pakistan. Afsana Ashiq. Do you remember the name? Exactly one and a half year back... ...only since you instigated... ...the Kashmiri Muslim girl who stone pelted on Indian Army... ...was shown as a terrorist by the whole world. Do you know where she is, now? The Indian Army, on which she threw stones... ...because of that Indian Army's training... ...today, she is the captain of Jammu and Kashmir football team. She is ready to represent India internationally. If a person is with you, he is a terrorist. With us, a sportsperson. - Timid people. Anish, your timidness speaks about peace. Our courage asks to do war. Keep a step forward and see... ...India map will be changed. How will you win? Your country shook for the one hour surgical strikes. Did you forget how? Ghazi, India is not new to war. You can never win. Kashmir belongs to Pakistan. Till now, India and Pakistan fought three wars. Very soon, fourth one will take place, and that too only for Kashmir. Kashmir will be merged in Pakistan. Because, this is our Jihad. Jihad? Ghazi, this is India. If our 'Jaihind' becomes Jihad... ...what will happen to you? Think for yourself. 'Hello, hello, hello.' - Tell your father, this is not politics. Nitya, dear. Dear, please speak. Daddy. Daddy. - I did a mistake, dear. The same injustice that I did to your mother... No, daddy. You were correct. The sacrifice that you are doing for the country... ...I could understand it now, daddy. They killed watchman in front of our eyes. - Ask him to leave Ghazi Baba. He is asking to leave Ghazi Baba. Don't leave Ghazi Baba, at any cost, daddy. Dear. 'Nitya, Nitya.' Dear. Hello, hello. Dear. - Do me a small favour, daddy. Tell me, dear. I don't know if I will meet my friends or not. Tell Solemn that I like him. Nitya, Nitya. Nitya. This is the place from where Faru spoke to the Minister over satellite phone, Sir. All these days, by telling my father's name... ...I escaped everywhere. But now if I tell my father's name... ...I am afraid that they will kill even my father. They will not leave anyone. They are terrorists. To release someone... ...they targeted Nitya. Sorry, man. Father said that, if we say out our sins, then the sins can be compensated. Hey, what are you saying, man? If I don't agree the truth, God will not pardon me. What happened? He loved you when he saw you. He likes you so much. He will give his life for you. But, me. - Hey, what is it, now? Not that, man. It is me, who made Tanya to suspect you. I was jealous, man. That's why, I mislead Tanya. Solemn. Everyone makes mistakes. - Yes. But, it's not a mistake, if we do to bring two people together. But me, I did a mistake to separate you both. Hey. Sorry, man. - Guys, please. Love is born, not when someone says so. It's a feeling, yaar. Jealous is a part of it. You didn't do any mistake. Saying that you have friends,... ...saying that you are in love... ...you know what it means? ...we are not just existing. We are living. Nitya and we are friends. Hey, move. - Come. Take them. - Hey. Don't do anything. Hey. Please. Please. Don't do. Hey. - Please don't do anything. It's been 6 hours that we killed a person. Your government didn't respond yet. Will they not understand till we kill another? (Gun shots) Go check. Fast. Move fast. (Screams) You go there. Don't leave anyone. Vamshi. Oh no. They are killing our brothers, brother. (Gun shots) (Gun shots) (Gun shots) Leave me. - Let's go, brother. Arjun, Arjun. Come on line. - Sir. Look. - We surrounded the house, Sir. Arjun, listen to me. - Everything is under control, Sir. Listen. Listen to me. - Just give some time. It'll be done, Sir. Arjun, abort the mission. What? Sir, no. Just give me five minutes. It will be done, Sir. - Arjun. The government has decided to release Ghazi Baba. Sir, please listen to me. - Listen to me. This is government's decision, Arjun. There is nothing that we could do. Oh. We are releasing you, Ghazi. (Laughs) I need to speak to Faruq. Greetings, Faruq. Baba. - They are leaving me. (Screams) Tell me now, Baba. What is your order? Where are you? This Lambasingi village near Visakhapatnam, Baba. Through sea, we will cross Indian waters and go to Bangladesh. Okay, Baba. Vizag Naval base. Ask the ship in Kakinada... ...be prepared for us. (Phone Disturbance) Arjun. I know that you are listening to us by intercepting us. You said that day... ...that I will not take orders. Now I am telling you... ...you have to escort them to Kakinada and it's an order. One more condition. I didn't like your beard. Arjun, you came here like a shadow, searching for that girl. I will not let your efforts go waste. I am sending that girl out. Arjun, you must have kept snipers for me. Don't do such stupid thing. I gave reverse circuit for bomb remote. If the bullet gets in my head, my finger will be released. Bomb will blast. (Bomb beep) Please help me. Checkmate. (Bomb beep) Sir please. Get down. (Footstep sound) (Door close) Get down. Fast. Move. Fast. - Move. (Bomb beep) (Doors open) Sir, Sir. NI officer, Anish Kurivilla has just arrived here... ...and he didn't reponded regarding the issue. Greetings, Baba. Leave Ghazi Baba. (Bomb beep) Arjun Pandit. Do you remember? I already said that same signatures, same orders will surrender me to my people. Ghazi Baba never breaks his promise. Ghazi. I will not leave her till I cross Indian waters. That was not the deal, Ghazi. You said you will leave them. Go away. You will be spared. If not, look. Move. Hey. - Arjun. Come. Arjun. Put your weapon down. I will kill this girl. Leave him. Leave Ghazi. That's an order. I don't take your orders anymore, Sir. If you want you can court martial me. Arjun. Kill her. Okay, okay. You also come with us on boat. Once we cross the Indian waters... ...I will hand over that girl to you. You hand over Ghazi Baba to me. Now you are on the right path, Faruq. Guns down. Guns down, guns down. Move. (Screams) (Screams) (Kicks) Your country, which has 1.3 billion population couldn't do anything. You are alone. What can you do? (Kicks) Hey. Hey Ghazi. To stop someone like you, we don't need 1.3 billion people. One soldier, like me, who represents the country, is enough. Not even one of you will be spared of their lives. Arjun... If needed, we will all die together. (Bomb beep) No, no. (Fingers snap) (Kicks) (Bomb beep) (Slaps) You are used to killing people by turning their heads back. Checkmate. (Bomb beep) I already told you Ghazi. If there is a situation to leave you, pray that I should not be present there. An Indina will never break his promise. Jaihind. Yes. I did a mistake. When Ghazi Baba was at my gunpoint... ...when I got the orders not to kill Ghazi Baba... ...I did mistake by obeying the orders. If I had killed Ghazi Baba, then itself... ...this issue never would have risen at all. Yes, I did a mistake. With a fear that Faruq might do blasts and kill people to release Ghazi Baba... ...I broke the rules to bring Faruq to Hyderabad. Yes, I did a mistake. To stop Ghazi Baba, knowing that if he crosses Indian waters, we can't get him... ...I said, I don't take your orders anymore, and killed Ghazi Baba. Yes, I did mistake. For doing these mistakes... ...or for killing Ghazi Baba... ...I don't have any regrets, Sir. No. As important as punishing terrorists like Ghazi Baba is,... ...protecting officers like Arjun Pandit is also that important for our country. The reason behind Ghazi Baba's encounter is justified. (Typing sound) From August 5, 2019,... ...only one answer for Kashmir belongs to whom,... ...India. One nation,... ...one national flag. One citizenship. Reason, the cancellation of Article 370, 35a. This is a historic decision, which gave... ...hope to the scattered Kashmiri Pandits to go back to Kashmir. It's our India, our Kashmir. We will not even leave an inch. We will stay with you. This is the promise of every Indian. Jaihind. (Indian Flag) This movie dedicated to scattered families of Kashmiri Pandits and Army soldiers.
