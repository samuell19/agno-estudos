This is not a happy ending. But this is how everything ends for me. With small problems that nobody cares about. Anyway, nothing lasts forever. This was a ticking time bomb. There are thousands of cities like this one in the world. Big... gray... dirty and boring. An alarm goes off at 7:00 every day to signal that the curfew is over. People can go outside and enjoy the progress, the factories, the empty rivers, the crime and the war. That's the routine. So you want them in blue. Because it's all about routine here. That's right. Yes. Dante! - Yes, please give me a minute. - My mom started working recently, and she discovered that her passion is selling shoes. Honey. I left the money on the table. Take out the trash, okay? It's just the two of us in this house. But it wasn't always like this. Two years ago, my dad was transferred to another plant. He moved to another city and we never heard from him again. Then my brother went to school abroad. His visits got less and less frequent. Now that my mom is a double diamond sales rep, she's busier than ever. Thank you. We get together at Chinatown, which is neither a town nor Chinese. It's just three stores under a grade separation. We can do what we want there and nobody bothers us. We play Hachiman, the best strategy card game. In other places there are card auctions and world championships. But here, only we know about it. Among the popular bands, the best are Megadeth, Slayer, Pantera, Meshuggah, Sepultura and, perhaps, Mastodon. And the oldies from Metallica. Metallica isn't metal. Metallica... "Metal" and "lica." They're not fast, they lack technique and they don't play heavy. But the feeling is what matters. That's why you're a virgin. Roman, the drummer. He's always a pain in the ass, but sometimes he makes us laugh. He keeps saying that he lost his virginity on the beach during our last summer break to a girl that nobody saw, nobody met and that we believe doesn't even exist. - That has nothing to do with it. - It has everything to do with it. - To begin... - Listen, Load, Reload and Lulu, that's not metal, that's pop. Those songs have three chords at most. Jorge is the bass player. Nobody taught him how to play, and nobody plays better than him. He's less popular than Roman and I, and that's saying a lot. He's called 911 so many times, that no one answers him anymore. - What do you think, dude? - They're just as bad. Rat, singer. He can't pronounce the "s" but, when he sings, he makes the ground shake. His dad has made him do Taekwondo since he was five. Although he's never won, he doesn't stop trying. He got kicked in the head and it seems that he's always absent-minded now. Dante, come! Marco would be the most popular in our group of friends, if he weren't 30 years older than us. He believes he's a great collector, but the truth is, he just likes to collect garbage. - Seven hundred dollars. - I said no. - It's seven. - No! Hey, I may even get to 800 in a little bit. - Keep these 700 now... - No, no, no! Not even 800. It's worth a lot more. It's a gift from my brother. - You haven't even seen seven. - It's not for sale. Hold on. Hello? - Hello, is this Dante? - Yes. What's up? I'm the Necrosis concert producer. We listened to the demo you sent us, and we want you to be part of the event. Okay, so we're going to open? Well, you're part of the opening act together with six other bands. You'll be the first and will be opening for another band. Okay, okay. I got it. Thank you so much. Okay, see you there. We'll be opening for Necrosis! Necrosis is the most important, brutal death metal band of all time. In Sweden, their album "Winter Blood" was chosen as best album of the year in 23 lists. From the last five supporting artists, three were able to sign a contract in Europe. This is our chance to get out of here. EIGHT DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT - Rat says he's going to be late again. - What the hell... Is he gonna stay here, or are they gonna send him back to the hospital? Who knows... My brother Pablo gave me my three favorite things. My first guitar, my second skateboard, and Saturn, the hardest to get Hachiman card. When he gave it to me, it was the last time we spoke. Will he wake up? Of course he'll wake up, you idiot. I hope. My mom says talking to him helps. And what do you talk about? Who the fuck left the lock open? Not me. What are you doing here? - How did you open the lock? - With this. She's Pablo's girlfriend. I'm Lucy. What's up? She came to help my brother, supposedly. She behaves as if this was her house. It's all dirty and messy. She's a real pain in the ass. - You can't smoke in here. - Really, dude? Bullshit! - Of course we can smoke, dude. - No, we can't, you idiot! We're going to rehearse. You can stay if you want. I can't. I'm going to see Pablo. Dude. I took this, okay? Your mom told me it was fine. Bye. I want to fuck her, dude. No way! She's my brother's girlfriend. Who cares? Tell me you don't want to fuck her. You? - She's hot. - She's not hot. Besides, I can't stand her. - How long is she staying here? - I've no idea, my mom invited her. Can we get started, please? Why are we discussing this now? 'Cause our songs could sound cooler if we added some melodic things. Nah, we've always played pure death and that's how it is going to be, dude. That's not true, dude. Our first song is super progressive. We don't even play that song anymore, dude. Besides, we're not gonna open for Necrosis with crappy metal for girls which is what this idiot wants. What do you think, Rat? - About what? - About what he's saying... I think I'll pass. You'll pass what, dude? - I don't think I can stay in the band. - What about the gig, dude? Man, I'm sorry. But I have to train, dude. - Come on, Rat. Don't do this! - I can't, dude. Sorry! SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT Hey! What's up? Hello! Dante! Hello! Dude! - What the hell? It was the last fight. - So what? You idiot. I'm the guest. - My mom's guest. - And Pablo's. - How was that? - You know what you're doing? Round two. Fight! So what's up? How's the band going? - The singer left. - No way! Who was it, Roman? - No, Roman is the drummer. - Okay. - Why don't you sing? - Because... Come on. Stop. What? I don't have that voice type. Besides, I can't play and sing at the same time. Motherfucker! Dude, those are all excuses, okay? Just do it. Is there a better plan? Well... look for a singer. SINGER WANTED - What's up? You got them? - Yes, but we need to hand these out. Look, man. Take some to Green Hills, and Jorge and I will go downtown. Okay. Why should I go alone? You're too busy or what? No, but it's closer for you. They look cool, right? Are you gonna put them up now? Do you want to come with me to Green Hills? - What's that? - It's really dangerous. Shut up, man. Dangerous my ass. Green Hills is okay. - Wanna come? - Okay. - Let's go. - Yeah, let's go. SINGER WANTED DEATH METAL BAND Gimme. - And why don't you sing? - He's a coward. Alright, look. I don't know anybody, but we can put them up here. - Okay? - Okay. - Hey, stop cheating! - What, man? - I'm watching you. - Don't worry, man. It's okay. Dante. It's okay. - Are you selling the card? - No, it's not for sale. Then I'm not sure I can help with the flyers. - Hi, mom. How are you? - Hi, sweetie! Well, you know... struggling. I'll be back on Friday. I need you here now. I can't do everything by myself. How's dad doing? How's he feeling? What do you mean "how's he feeling?" You know he's feeling awful. I'll be back soon. You're so selfish. You don't care about your father, you don't care about your family, you don't care about me. - I need you here now! - Mom! What's up? It's okay, you can stay. Go on, it's good for him. Just don't turn around. - What's that? - What? - Why do you draw on him? - It's a tattoo we were gonna get. - So stupid. - "So stupid." What grade are you in, boy? Tenth. Why does that matter? Dante, come out, please! - What? - Nothing. You took my perfume. - No. - No? No. Yes, you did. I smell it! I thought it was air freshener. Wait, air freshener? - Yeah, so what? - Yeah, right. Dude, what's worse is that this idiot was so drunk that his boss had to call an ambulance. For real? Well, that dude is always hammered. Hey, hey, hey. What the hell is this? What? Well, why did you put them up all together? Why not? What do you mean, "why not"? You idiot! Listen, you jerk, we did the job. Besides, it's already online. No, you wasted so much time. What were you doing? Are you stupid or what? You're pissed off because I went with Lucy, right? No way! What does that have to do with this? Don't stress, envy belongs to the devil. It's not envy, asshole. She's my brother's girlfriend. - Who cares? She's hot. - Go to hell! - Where do I put these? - Put those there. - How did it go? - Good. All cool. What's this crap? - It's Saturn, the god of time. - No, dude, the card. It's the coolest card you can have. It gives you three turns and also three fire resistance turns. Well... It costs over 1100. Okay. If it's so expensive, then how did you get it? My brother got it and he gave it to me. - You can't smoke in here. - Come on, dude. Stop whining. You look the same here. Can I listen to your songs? Which ones? What do you mean which ones? Yours, dude. It's just a demo and we don't have the final versions yet. Okay... Here. They're awesome! Dante! I like it. Dante! Go to bed! Hey, Dante. Do you have a girlfriend? No. Have you had one? Never, ever? You never kissed anyone, right? - What? - What? No way. Dante! - Tell me, dude! - Move over... Dammit, you've never kissed anyone. Well I don't have time for that shit anyway. - Hey, so when's your gig? - Saturday. So I don't think I can make it. I'm leaving Friday. So soon? Why? Are you gonna miss me a lot? No, I just thought you were staying longer. - No! - Stop! Okay... good night! Here. So that you can listen to them. SIX DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT Fuck. I'm here to audition. - What? - What? - For real? - Yeah, so? - But you don't know the songs. - Dante shared them. Yeah? But you're leaving the day before, right? Jesus, do you want to listen to me or not? Let's do it. Walking down the street And looking at the sky We all scream while living in this hell Hi, mom. Is dad there? He's sleeping. Why do you need him? Well, I just wanted to tell you that I'm staying one more day. What do you mean one more day. What for? There's something I need to do. What do you have to do that's more important than helping us? Something. I can't believe how irresponsible you are. Okay, I was just letting you know. Your father is being hospitalized on Monday. I need you here. - Hey there! - What's up? Where's my mom? She left because she was sick of you. I'm the boss, now. What? Nothing, nothing. You sang nicely. Thank you. What do you think Pablo thinks? - About what? - Well, about you and me. That we even have a band... I don't know. You're actually cool. I mean, I couldn't stand you before 'cause I thought you were a jerk, but you're not. That's good. You are annoying, but it's okay. You guys are cool. What's up? I can't sleep. - Hi! - Hi! - Go get some rest. - No, I'm fine. Are you sure? Go take a walk. No blood and no fighting. That movie was a piece of shit, man. - You didn't get it, dude. - What didn't I get? Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and Antonio Banderas whining for two damn hours. Did you read the book, dude? Nah, I'm not gonna read that shit. It's Twilight of the 90s. No way! Dude, there's nothing wrong with it. You go. - You got it, man. - You see? You're the man, dude. He should've read the damn book, man. It's cool, really. Enough, Jorge. Be quiet, dude. Hey, Brad Pitt sucks, period. Are you okay? - Yes, what are you doing here? - I was looking for you. - Why or what for? - I don't know... hang out, maybe. Hey, man. Marco is waiting for us! Honestly, I don't feel like it. Let's do something you and I. Okay. We're not going, thanks. What do you want to do? I don't know. What do you want to do? I don't know, you're the one who lives here. You tell me, what's ace? Nothing around here. Holy shit! Okay, imagine that the world is about to end in one minute. What do you do? I stay here with you. Fuck, man. I'd be calling everyone. Or not. You stay here and I go. Hey! What's the matter? Why? Well, it'd be so boring to watch you on the phone on my last minute. Text messages? One? One... one. Two? No, I don't think so. What if there was one week left? - Record one song, properly. - Properly? Properly. In a studio, with a producer, and you as the singer. Did you really like it that much? Yes, you sing well. Anyway, it doesn't matter, Dante. Everyone will already be dead. Well, then I'd rather not know. I would. Why? Well, if everything is gonna go to hell, at least I'd like to see it, right? That's why I'm saving up to go to Alaska and see the glaciers. Why do you wanna see that? Dude, they're awesome! And I heard that the sound is amazing when they break. Yeah, but that's not the end of the world. Yeah, right, Dante! Of course it's the end of the world. Everything's going to hell. And... do you have a lot saved up? About 1000. But I need more. What's that? Nothing, come. Hey! Hey, I'm sorry. I couldn't run anymore. It's okay. It was the last one. Yes. Goddammit. Is it really far? Yes. - What's wrong? - Damn, what the hell? Are you okay? My God. Alright, enough. I'm gonna stop that car. No, I don't think it's a good idea. Stop here. Help me, man! This dude is heavier. Throw him here, on the sidewalk. Boss, it's all done the way you ordered it. Of course, sir. You can relax. The boss says that we should just get rid of the damn guy. Well, kiddos, we're gonna have to drive a little more. - Let's go. - On three... - Ready? - One, two, three. They didn't see what way we ran. I was shit-scared. What's that? Hey, stop it. What do you have there? You nailed it, dude. You're dirty all over. You're even worse! How do you get rid of this? Let me see... I'll get something. Your face is dirty. No, it's here, look. Hey, I'm so thirsty. I'll get you a drink. Motherfucker. Shit. Shit! Shit! Motherfucker... What's up? - Do you have your bass? - Yes, man. My guitar and computer were stolen, man. Damn! - What about the amps? - They're here. - And the pedals? - Yeah, yeah, that too. And the drums? Everything else is here, man. They didn't take anything else? No way! - Is Lucy there? - Yes. Put her on. She says she doesn't wanna talk to you. Put her on, you asshole. She says she's really busy. Enough, okay? Where are you, man? - Where do you think? - Put her on, you asshole! "Victim dies after being stabbed seven times with the same knife she was using to cut the oranges." RED ALERT THEY SQUEEZE THE JUICE OUT OF IT Hey, who wrote that? Did you go into my room again? Yes or no? What's going on, man? My damn guitar was stolen. No shit. And what about my drums? Nah! Who would want all that shit anyway? Hey, I'm sorry. Whatever. If you need to buy a new one, I'll pitch in. It's not cool that my brother is unconscious at home while you're here. What? I see. So I'm the asshole? Yesterday you didn't care. RED ALERT THEY SQUEEZE THE JUICE OUT OF IT We could be like Primus, man. Just bass. Primus isn't just bass, man. Who were those that played with only bass? - They had a cool song. - They have like two really cool albums. - I know, man. But what was their name? - Dammit, enough with that crap! We're in trouble. There are thousands of guitars in the city. We'll get one for sure. Calm down! - What if we ask Bobby for his? - No, no. That guitar is horrendous. Hor-ren-dous. - It's impossible to play with it. - Okay, so what do we do now? Wanna come get more smokes? Let's go. THREE DAYS UNTIL THE CONCERT - How much? - What do you mean how much? - You know it's worth 1100. - I don't have 1100. - Yeah, right. - Yeah, right? If I had 1100, I'd buy it in perfect condition. That one is not in perfect condition. There's only 100 in the whole damn world. So why do you want to sell it? You're always telling me to go to hell, but now you're sweet-talking me... It's weird. It's weird. Okay, let me see it again. No! My card is just fine. It's not "that" fine. I mean, I just saw it up close and it's not that fine. You need dough, right? Are you in trouble? Listen... I'll give you 100. A hundred? Are you out of your mind, or what? You need dough, right? Or maybe I won't sell it. Are you sure? I don't think anybody will give you cash now. I mean not just like that... Come on, man. Give me a break. Look, here's 200, 220. That's all I have, for real. Damn. How did you get this? Well, here it is. - What the hell's this? - I sold the card. No way! For real? Hey, and where's the rest? - There's no rest. - Man, you got so screwed over! Why? You didn't sell it, man. You gave it away! - You sold it to Marco. - Well, yeah. Who else? He took you for a fool, man. Really. He took you for a fool. Why, you jerk? 'Cause this is not enough to buy anything decent, man! Shut up. Of course it's enough at the railroad. You just got screwed over by this asshole and now you wanna go to the railroad? - No way. - If you're not up for it, whatever. You're never up for it. Dude... It's cool. Come on, dude. - Hey, don't stop. - Hey, relax. Take it! It's the one and only, the original and miraculous tonic by Dr. Salomon. Get one for two fifty, three for five. It's great for all types of ailments or pain. Ma'am, kiss those painful varicose veins goodbye forever, and ever! For rheumatism, bites, and also for baby rash. Sir, beat your baldness. Ma'am, fight your skin dryness. And that one? No! They're all pretty shoddy, actually. Dude, this one isn't that bad. No way. It's a piece of shit. Hey, at least it's American. Dante! Motherfuckers! For nervousness, depression, anxiety! For a heartbreak! What did you do, you idiot! Dude! Hey! What's up? It got smashed damn hard. Are you okay? Yeah. Let me see. No way! It looks horrible... this part. You look good. I mean, you look normal, yeah... Here you go. Your prescription, your bill. - You can pay at the register. - Thanks. Fuck. Well, I have some... No way! What about your card? Yeah, I don't give a shit. Thank you. Thank God it wasn't that bad. Just picture yourself without an eye. I already told you that you're too old for skateboarding! - I told you that before, didn't I, Dante? - Yes, mom. And you, honey, please be careful. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. Yes, man. Hannibal Lecter's real name was Alfredo Ballí, and he was imprisoned in jail. I can't believe it, man. Here? Yes, man. The same dude... A doctor... cannibal. Totally nuts, but the dude was a genius. Well, just because it's like him doesn't mean that they were inspired by him. It was, dammit! You don't get it. The writer came here in the 70s to interview an American that was in jail. He wrote the novel, and then they made the movie. What about Buffalo Bill? Who knows? I think that dude is American. - It looks cool, right? - It's nice. I have to go, man. Okay, no problem. I'll clean up. Okay, see you. Thank you! Don't worry, ma'am. I'll be outside. Hey! I can't find my keys, dude. You left them on the table by the front. Thanks. Does it hurt? Yes, don't touch me. - Let's go get smokes. - Sure. Let's go. Weren't you hungry, man? Roman is a piece of shit. He risked it on the last rehearsal, though. He's early and he's learning to keep time. FLUTES TACOS ONE DAY UNTIL THE CONCERT Dante! Dante! Hold on, you jerk! - What's your problem, asshole? - Hey, what's your problem? Who the hell do you wanna impress? You started it by getting stuck with the drums. I was testing some arrangements, you jerk! That's bullshit. What arrangements? You weren't even in time. - Okay, guys, knock it off! - Yeah, man, enough. Man. Why don't you shut up? You sounded worse than Roman. Wait a second. You're the one that got carried away. And who started it. - Enough, you guys! - Yes, man. Enough. Yeah, Dante. What was that? And stop crying. I'm not crying, you idiot. Okay, you know what? Fuck it. Let me know when you're ready to practice. - Hey, hold on! - Don't tell me what to do, you idiot. You idiot. Are you okay? Hey, I'm sorry about the rehearsal. No, I'm sorry. The truth is, we're ready. Yeah, thanks for the favor. It's not a favor. It's a bummer that you have to go. I'm gonna miss you. Really? I'll see you tomorrow? Are... we going together? I still have to pack a few things, leave everything in order. I'd rather meet you there, okay? Okay, at 8:00. It was about time, man. Hey, I've been calling you. I forgot my phone. Get ready. You're up in ten minutes. - Where's Lucy? - I don't know. She told me she'd be here last minute. Alright, let me have your phone so I can call her. - Are there any people? - Yeah, dude. It's packed. Goddammit. Okay, let me try. She always answers me. Maybe it's because of the rain. She's not picking up, dude. Don't be an idiot. It's not raining here. Alright, asshole. Just mind your own business and I'll deal with Lucy, okay? Whatever... Fuck you. Hey, what are we gonna do, man? She won't make it. Yes, she will. And if she doesn't, then let's have this asshole sing, right? You wrote the lyrics. No, man. You know I won't. I can't coordinate with both. Your damn excuses. Get ready, guys. One more song and you go. Why doesn't Dante sing? Is he still afraid? Shut up, you idiot. We have someone better. Wake up, dude. She stood us up. No way she stood me up. Not after last night... Stop with the fucking lies. I was with Lucy last night. Who? The chick that was at the store with Roman, dude. What do you mean, asshole? - Hey, relax. - You relax, asshole. Dude! My bass, you jerk. Hey, come on. Stand up, it's all good. - Besides, that bass is worthless, man. - You're a piece of shit, you bastard. Well, at least I don't wanna fuck my comatose brother's girlfriend, dammit! The bass is useful. You're so dead, you asshole. Son! How are you? He can't speak or strain himself. Coming! What do you want? You forgot this yesterday. Thanks. You didn't miss out on anything... Well, you missed watching damn Rat making a fool of himself. How's Pablo doing? He's good. - Are we allowed to talk to him? - Not yet. We're going to Louis' house tomorrow, in case you wanna come. Everyone's going. Okay, I'll call you tomorrow. Dante! Come help us with the luggage! Come on, sweetie. Do a full service and put them in the trunk. - Thank you so much for everything. - It was my pleasure. - Have a good trip and please take care. - Thank you. - Good luck on your trip. - Thank you. Take care. This is not a happy ending. But this is how everything ends for me. In little dramas that nobody cares about. Anyway, nothing lasts forever. This was a ticking time bomb. Are you okay? THE END THANK YOU
