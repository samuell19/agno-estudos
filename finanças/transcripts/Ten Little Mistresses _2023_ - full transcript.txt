Shared trouble on the way The toilet should be spotless. Yes, Miss Lilith. That side is still dusty. Ten little mistresses Is this what you do? Ruby, don't forget to fix that one, okay?

They're almost here. - They're almost here. - They're almost here. Remember, our guests are VIPs. They expect A-1 hospitality. We must deliver. Don Valentin's honor is at stake. Understood? Yes, Miss Lilith. I have given you our guests' pictures and dossiers. Memorize their pertinent personal information. Yes, Miss Lilith. Mesdames, you may enter the mansion. Hold it right there! I'll go first as I am the queen! What? The queen or the monster? But if the oldest must go first, then go ahead. Excuse me, madame. Will you please assist me? Yes, of course, madame. Ooh la la! Madame, we're still waiting for Don Valentin. Have a drink first. Please hand them a glass of champagne. This mansion is huge! Look at this place! As huge as his… And look at me. What a sight to behold! Magenta, Magenta, Magenta. Babet, please! Don't come any nearer. You look like a disco ball. I know, right? My beauty is blinding. We can't do anything about it. And look at you. Are you going to attend a wedding, or you're gonna have your first communion? Oh, this thing. I just threw it on while half-asleep in the car. - Oh, really? - Yes. But it lacks something. It does? Tell me. It lacks taste. Envious bitch! I'm the most perfect among you all. Hi. I need a drink. Madame, I'm so sorry. I'm really sorry. It's fine. - Where's the powder room? - There. I need a bit of a retouch. This way. Please follow me. No need to retouch, Diva. You look beautiful as always. You mean my gorgeous face, Doctor? This isn't done yet. I should know. You're wearing a face of my creation. Would you like to see how she used to look when she was just my lowly aesthetician? Look at that face! - Ugly Betty could never! - Where did you get that? I already deleted that! This woman mimics even my fashion style. Like, really? She has no shame. Wanna know how she repaid me after I made her pretty? Excuse me, Doctor Helga… She stole my Valentin after I fixed the wreck that was her face. Huh? Excuse me, Doctor! I didn't steal Valentin because he is not yours in the first place. Look around. We are all members of The Paramour. Side chick. Other woman. Mistress. Only mistresses like you beg for crumbs. I was never a mistress. I've learned that what you think is yours is not actually yours. Like forever is a choice, everything is a choice. You determine what makes you happy. Besides, I must say, among all the mistresses here, you are the filthiest. No. You're the filthiest! I can see a booger swinging in that big nose of yours. That's the best you've got? I'll tell you what. You're the cheapest mistress! Madame, careful with the champagne. - She's mocking me! - One, two… - Chiclet! - Look this way. - Let's take one from this angle. - Chiclet! No! No, it's fine. I love being adored by my fans. Madame, may I have one last request? I'll take a video of you saying your iconic line. I'll send it to my boyfriend. "Because?" Perfect! Say it again, madame. My boyfriend will love this for sure. - "Because?" - Hang on, madame. I'll record it. No, I'm curious. What's with your boyfriend and my meme? "Because?" He's an avid fan of yours, madame. Excuse me, madame. Are you all right? Look at her. Acting like she's a superstar. She only became famous when her manager got the idea to name her "Because". Everyone thinks she's cute whenever she answers "Because?" to all the questions. But the truth is, she's a dumbass. I've competed with her in countless pageants. She has always failed the Q&A portion. Excuse me. Where the fuck is Valentin? He's get dressed, madame. Oh my God. I know you! Valentin brought me to one of your concerts. You sang all of Lady Gaga's songs. What's your name again? Guess. Sia? What do you think of me? A copycat? It's G. Lady G. - What's happening? - What happened to you? Is she okay? - Madame, what's wrong? - Is she sick or something? I can't breathe! - Water, please! - My heart. It's palpitating. No. Champagne. - Champagne. - Champagne! We should've said no to Valentin's invitation. Because? - Why? - Something terrible is going to happen. And what is it, madame? Are you wearing contact lenses? No, madame. They're real. For real? If those are real, then why are they blue? Are you a Smurf? You're a Smurf, aren't you? Focus, madame. What is the terrible thing that is going to happen? Oh, right. There. A tragedy. Somebody will die tonight! Girl, are you okay? Don't you have any positive predictions? My gosh. What happened to her? Hello! Welcome to the club! If I'm not mistaken, you must be the newest member of our group. Yes? Valentin's mistress before the pandemic lockdown. Pleased to meet you! Are you Korean? Nope. To be Korean is my escape, a way to forget my stupid decisions in life. But I love watching Korean dramas. Girl… you look bothered. Is there a problem? Smile! We're here to celebrate Valentin's birthday! It feels more like a celebration of male privilege and patriarchy. Look at this gathering. It's so regressive. I like you already. But tell me, if you are angry at the male gaze, why did you become a mistress? No woman would choose to be a mistress. And yet, here we are… fighting over a man. Well, not me. I mean… The world's like a one big, public wet market. Beware of the scammers. And where thieves abound, you need to learn how to fight! Hey! Hey, hey! There it is, Miss Lilith. Where the hell is Valentin?! Are we supposed to wait for him forever? Show yourself! Valentin! Come down already. This oldie can't keep her panties up any longer! Excuse me?! Why? Did I lie? Now that Valentin's a widower, you're hoping that he'll marry you. - Of course! - Come to think of it, your seniority is your best feature. Enjoy your 20% discount! Hey! Mrs. Reynolds Wrap with the skin of a porcupine. - I'm not in the mood, okay? - What? I'm warning you. I'm a dangerous woman. Don't start with me. Bullies like you don't frighten me. Just say when and where! - Oh so you want war?! - Yeah. So what? Then I'll give you war! Just tell me where and when and I'll be there wearing my red stilettos! Freaks, freaks, freaks! You, Jurassic lady. What's stopping you from taking on the dragon lady? - Let's see some action now! - Do it now! Catfight! Are you serious? A catfight is so '60s male entertainment! Besides, your Botox might crack. It's not worth it. Helga, please. Mind your own Botox! Excuse me, this face is not Botoxed! Yeah, sure. And I am the Virgin Mary. You know what, just start the catfight already! It's Don Valentin! Valentin! Good afternoon, ladies of all ages, sizes, and shapes. My sweet and gentle butterflies. Lady G. Magenta. Because. Helga. Coco. Aura. Moon-Young. Diva. Babet. Sparkle. Come to Daddy! Daddy! Thank you for the gift of your presence on this most important of days. Not only because it is my birthday, but also to celebrate victory over what I endured during the pandemic. As you all know, I had COVID, and my wife Charo became terminally ill. I survived… but I lost Charo. My wife. My best friend. Well, these past few months have made me introspective. I've realized my wayward ways… specifically, how I've wronged each and every one of you. I've invited all of you today to make amends… if you would allow me. - Yes. Of course, Valentin! - Of course. I know you may have doubts, but all will be revealed to you tonight. I've prepared a very special dinner for you. For now, it is best for everyone to rest in your rooms. Your trip was long and tiring. So ladies, see you all… tonight. Mesdames! We'll bring you to your rooms, so you can freshen up. - See you later… - I want… …at dinner. Miss Lilith, I prepared some sweetbreads and cheese. Yes, that's perfect. Thank you. Please put this on the side. Thank you. My God! Yes, madame? How many supplements is Valentin taking? A hundred. Fifty in the morning and fifty at night. Isn't that bad for his liver? He's used to it. When it was just Helga, Magenta, and I, he was only taking ten. Oh, well. The price to pay for maintaining a happy harem. I have a question. What do you know about the dinner later? It seems like something is brewing. I hate Valentin's surprises. They either make me happy or make me want to kill him. I remember three years ago. He gifted me and my friends a cruise vacation. He did the same to the other mistresses. He sent all of us away because he had a new mistress. I'm sorry, madame. I have no idea what will happen tonight. Of course. What do you know? You're just a butler. Madame, you're a successful woman. Why do you… Why don't you… I'm sorry. Say it. I don't mind. Why don't you leave Don Valentin? Well… maybe because I love him? Maybe I'm used to being his mistress? Or maybe I'm just stupid. If I knew the answer, I wouldn't be here. I have a favor to ask. What is it? Later, tell the other mistresses that Valentin doesn't want any of them to wear white at the party. Especially Magenta. But why? Just do it. Here. You may take this. That's real Saudi gold. It's gorgeous! Are you sure? Fine. I take it back. Don't forget to inform them, Lilibeth. It's Lilith. Whatever, Judith. - Are these complete? - Yes, Don Valentin. Valentin! Don Valentin, here are your vitamins. My brother's arriving tonight. But he'll be late. Just show him to his room. - He can join us for dinner, if he wants. - Yes, sir. Which is better? Is Because the calendar girl again this year? I cancelled the annual search because of the pandemic. I want everyone to be safe. I choose this one. - Tell them to reprint it. - All right, sir. Fabulous. How are our guests? They're relaxing in their rooms. They want to know what's going to happen tonight. Don Valentin? Are you having an asthma attack? - Chiclet, get a glass of water! - Yes, miss. Where is your inhaler? Is it here? Here you go. Don't mind it. I was just tired from all the preparations for tonight. You have nothing to worry about. I've prepared everything down to the smallest detail. Thank you, Lilith. You've always been reliable. Good evening, mesdames. Welcome! Please come in. Oh, gosh! It seems like you're not happy with your gown, Magenta. This is so annoying! I don't get why Valentin doesn't want us wearing white tonight. I've already prepared my wedding… - What was that? - I mean, my evening gown. Oh my God. Look at you. You look like a Golden Buddha. Did you melt all the gold in your pawnshop to achieve this look? Not all. For your information, my pawnshop has 5,000 branches nationwide, apart from my wide network of international partners. Well, even if you dip copper in gold, it's still cheap. And I believe that fake breasts won't make an old lady younger. - Bitch! - I know, right? Diva, Diva! Oh my God! Seriously, Diva? Do you really have to copy my ball gown? You're such a copycat! Or is it the other way around? Aren't you the one who is copying me? Excuse me?! You're excused! I need to offer you, so we can reverse the curse of tonight's event. Madame! Madame, please hand me back the chicken. The cook's gone crazy looking for that chicken. No. I need to offer it. Can we just do it tomorrow? That's for our dinner. We are short of fried chicken. - Fried chicken? - Yes, madame. Okay, sure. Chicky is yours. Tell the chef to air fry it for me. Noted, madame. What if the tragedy that she keeps on talking about comes true? With all the mistresses here, there's bound to be a tragedy. I'll just take a photo over there. - Go ahead. - Wait here. Excuse me. Are you stealing my volcano walk? Volcano walk? Don't you mean lava walk by Catriona Gray? Volcano. Lava. It's the same thing. Duh! Why are you so insecure of me? Because? Excuse me?! You're just a walking meme. A running joke. I have nothing to be insecure about. You're jealous that I'm done with pageants. I am already famous, while you're still stuck there desperately trying to win a crown. First of all, don't be presumptuous. You're nothing more than a passing trend. And trends quickly come and go. Second, you were never my rival because we're not on the same level. If we're not on the same level, then why are you so mad at me? What's that called again? - Insecurity! - Move! Bad breaths! - But I just brushed my teeth. - Oh my gosh. Valentin! Where's Valentin? Valentin… here are your medicines. Oh, there you are! Valentin! My love, why aren't you dressed? I feel anxious. Do you really need to introduce me? My love, we've talked about this. You shouldn't have insisted on being the butler. You don't have to take orders from them. I know my place, my love… at least before the wedding. Now, I'm still just the butler. I want to show them how you first came to love me. My love. This is why I fell in love you. You have a good heart. Time to get ready. I can't wait to show off my bride to the world. - I love you! - My love! Oh, there you are. Good evening, my dearly beloved. Happy birthday, Valentin, my love! Feliz… Feliz Navidad! Valentin! Thank you, Helga. And to you, Diva. It isn't Christmas yet, but Merry Christmas to you, ho ho ho! This night is not about me. It is for each and every one of you. But first, I want to honor my wife Charo. I was such a foolish man, a selfish man. I can't imagine how painful it must have been for her enduring a life of humiliation and betrayal. Despite all that, she never left me. Up to the last moment of her life, she chose to be my wife. So, Charo, this night is also for you. Tonight will be the beginning of a new me. And I want to mark it by asking for forgiveness. Nothing could make up for all the wrongs I have caused each of you. But I hope that these gifts can somehow make you smile. Gifts?! - So ladies… - There will be gifts! Here are ten gifts that I carefully picked for all of you. - Bring them in. - Bring them in! The first gift. Oh my God! What is this?! This is huge! It's a key to a car! Oh my God! Yes, ladies. You are each getting a sports car! I love it! Bring in the second gift! - Give it to me! - Come on, faster! Thank you. At the count of three. One… Two… Three… - What?! - A land title for me? Oh my God! - Finally! A house! - Girl, that's just a land title! The third gift. One… Two… Three! Oh my gosh! Magenta! What you need is a grandfather's clock! - Oh my God! - Here you go! Bring in the fourth gift! Faster! Faster! Move faster, you penguins! Open it! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, ladies! - Damn! This is so big! - Now… the fifth gift. Ready! - Oh my God! There are so many gifts! - Bring in the fifth gift. Ready… Relax, get set, and open it! - Yes! - Oh my God! This is overwhelming, Valentin! Moon-Young… This is wrong. This reeks of patriarchal culture. He's showing dominance over us by buying our dignity with expensive things. And now… bring in the ninth gift! It fits my waist! Yes! Yes! - Pretty. Fits you. - Yes! Yes… Yes! Amazing! I thought I died and went to Heaven! And the Virgin Mary is here to welcome me. Don Constantin. I can never tell you apart from Don Valentin. But I am Valentin. That's not the way he laughs. My brother is right. You are such a smart woman, and you have the most mesmerizing eyes. I'm not surprised that he chose to marry you. You know? Well, we might not see each other often, but I know all of his personal affairs. Is he introducing you to his other ladies tonight? Yes. He will ask for their blessings. Closure will be good to begin a new chapter in his life. Amazing! Very well. I'll just freshen up. I'll be with you shortly. All right, sir. Amazing! Holy Mary, Mother of God! Forgive us for all our sins. What are you doing? Miss Lilith? Sorry, I mistook you for the mother of God. I hope you're enjoying your gifts so far, ladies. And for my last and final gift, I created something special for each of you. This way, you will still have a piece of me. It's a special part of me that you'll surely miss when your nights are lonely. It will keep you company and make your cold nights steamy. What's that? A heater? Bring in the gifts. Give it to me! Faster! Faster! You're always full of surprises, Valentin! I'm so excited! Give it to me! At the count of three, ladies. One… Two… One… - Two… - Oh, no! One and a half… - Valentin! - Faster! Two and a half… And… three! Go! What is this?! - Same question. - It's a piece of art. What? A pleasure sculpture. A 24-carat gold-plated vibrator. All right. It seems like you don't like it, ladies. Do you find the gift offensive? No, no, no, Valentin. I think… I think we're just a little bit confused. Yes, we're a bit confused. Oh my God! Stop rephrasing everything I say! No. What we mean is, how can we remember you when this isn't even the right size? This is thicker and meatier compared to the original version. Just like a noodle! Angel hair! Let's not kid ourselves, Valentin! Wait a sec. But in fairness, this gold is authentic. Oh, sorry! And… made in China! Thank you, China! We can finally have an orgasm! Thank you, China! I'm glad you liked it… because that will be my last gift for you, and I'm saying goodbye. What? - Why? - I want to become a better man. I want to start again, to raise a family with a good woman whom I promise to be faithful to forever. That's me, right? Valentin has scammed us again! Right? We were so stupid thinking that one of us would be the one! Wait, I don't understand. Why not me? Because? My gosh! I don't get it. Why do you want to marry him anyway? You don't want to end up like Charo. She died heartbroken. You promised you would leave your wife for me! I waited all these years. You promised me the same thing ten years ago! Hey, Valentin! You're a bigger liar than Pinocchio! But among all your mistresses, I'm the only one who bore you a son. I deserve to be your legal wife. Excuse me! That's not how it works! - Shut up! - Why?! No one deserves to be married to Valentin except me! Me! Only me! I am the first mistress! Has no one taught you how to treat women, Valentin? If you treat us right, then we won't bite. But if you treat us wrong, it will be the biggest regret of your life! Give me back the chicken! I won't use it as sacrifice. I'll curse Valentin instead! Go! Do it! Your dick will shrink, and you won't be able to see it! Yeah, that's right! Calm down, calm down, calm down. Calm down, my precious ladies. I won't leave you penniless. All of you will be very well taken care of. It's just that, I've already found the love of my life, and I want to spend my remaining years with her. In fact, I want to introduce her to you. Please… be kind enough to welcome… Hang on. I'll just take my supplements. You know how important this is. Can you go any slower? Is this what we came here for? Magnesium, collagen, krill oil, L-glutathione, vitamin D3, vitamin B12, zinc, turmeric, probiotic. Just gulp it all down at once! I hope you choke to death. Why did you say that? What do you care? Now a tragedy is about to unfold! Ladies. - What's happening? - I'm okay. - What is it?! - What is it?! Oh my God! - Valentin? Are you all right? - What is happening? He's having an asthma attack! Valentin! Valentin! What's happening? Valentin! - What happened to him? - How would we know? Happy birthday to you Happy birthday… Turn on the lights! Valentin! Oh God, is he still alive? Don Valentin. Valentin! Call an ambulance! - This is all your fault! - This is your fault! Why?! He's dead. What happened? This is unbearable! Valentin! Despite everything, I loved him. How would I know he'd really choke? Did he really choke? Or was it a heart attack? A stroke? Has anyone called the funeral parlor? Anyone? Excuse me, mesdames. Excuse me. Yes. I already did. It'll take them a day to get here from the city. What?! I just answered your question. I still don't understand what happened. Why?! Valentin. Didn't I tell you that no one should be wearing white? How dare you wear a wedding dress! - What?! - What?! I thought that was Valentin's idea. Yes! - Hey, Babet! - What? You were sabotaging me again, weren't you?! And you! How dare you! Gosh! I wanted to wear white for tonight! - So did I! - Me too. My white gown was ready. My make up and outfit were all set! - You're foolish. - Okay. Okay! Ladies! Okay. In case you haven't noticed, my brother's dead. What happened? He was in prime health, strong as two water buffaloes. Someone killed Valentin. What?! And one of us is the killer. - Hey, that's not me. - Wait a minute. Take note, it wasn't me. I love Valentin so much! Hang on. If you're such a psychic… tell us who did it. I'm a psychic, not a detective. Wait. Shh, shh! What is it?! - What is it?! - What? The one who killed Valentin! - Who is it?! - The one who killed Valentin… - Who is it?! - …is someone close to him. Wow! Thanks for the clue! That was helpful! If only he listened to me. - You should have never come here. - Wow! Are you saying that one of us killed Valentin? Wait. Was he really murdered? Because? Hold on. Was he really going to marry you? Oh, yes! - So it was you?! - Show me proof. We need evidence! Maybe you're just making this up, Didith! Lilith! Okay! Valentin told me everything. Lilith is the love of his life. They fell in love soon after Charo's death. Wait. If that's the case, then why did you pretend to be the butler? She has a point. - I didn't pretend. - Really! - I am really the butler. - Is that so? Just because he's marrying me, I didn't want to act like some diva like all of you. Shut up! Amazing! Will you please set aside your personal issues? We are dealing with a serious matter here. Was my brother killed? Well, why don't we start by investigating the body? I mean, look… Is that how a murdered man would look like? How does a murdered man look like, exactly? A murdered body will have his tongue hanging out of his mouth and both his eyes marked with an X. Like in the cartoons? He was murdered. What? How do you know? Because I am… the killer. I killed him. - You?! - Oh my God! Hey! Come back here! Get her! I don't know why I'm grieving for Valentin's death. He didn't deserve my love. It's OK. That's why it hurts… because he didn't deserve our love. You'd think I had the world figured out. But for Valentin, I swallowed my pride. I know I shouldn't have loved him. But here we are. I still ended up falling for him. You don't have to explain anything, Coco. Women like us can't seem to practice what we preach. Mesdames, what are you doing here? Anyone care for some tea and crumpets? - Where is she? - Lady G! Show yourself! Where is that big-haired lady? There she is! Hey! What are you holding?! Hit us with that and you're dead! - Hey! - Don't ever think of doing it! Look! Look! There's blood on her paddle! I'm sure she killed one of the helpers! Hey, bitch! What are you saying?! I just came from the restroom. There was a rat in there. Amazing. Be thankful because I killed it. You were planning to escape, weren't you? You're lying! What? Escape? I just needed to pee! When I went back to the room, everybody was gone. Okay. Then explain. Did you murder Valentin? Yes, explain! We want to know what happened. Let me tell you a secret. Oh! I love secrets. Tell us. I am not the real Lady G. The truth is… I am… - Fabulous! - Wow! …Lady H. - Wow! - Lady H?! Lady G's brother. It smells awful! Catch! Right. There's nobody there. Because? Were you named after the alphabet? Question! Question! I have a question! Are you a lady, a boy, or a ladyboy? I am a non-binary. - What? - What is that? Polyamorous. Fairy. When Valentin's birthday party invitation arrived, I knew it was the perfect occasion for revenge. Valentin never told my sister that he was married and that he had ten ugly mistresses. Excuse me?! He fooled my sister ten times. And it hurts because she loved Valentin so much. And because of that… - And because of that… - Oh my God. Her sister took her own life! You think you know the story better? Stop interrupting! - The story seemed to be heading that way. - You're wrong. She became so heartbroken that she gave up her career. You will never understand me. It's a fate worse than death. Singing was her life. That's why I am here. I needed to avenge her. Your asthma attacks are becoming more frequent. My sister once told me that Valentin takes a lot of vitamins, supplements, minerals, and everything in between. That's when the idea of poisoning him occurred to me. Okay. So let me get this right. You're saying that you killed Valentin because your sister stopped singing? - Amazing! - You will never get it… until you hear her sing "Listen". What poison did you use? - Dora. - The explorer? The rat killer. It was in a capsule that I put among Valentin's tablets. I felt like I won the lottery. Goodbye, Valentin. You deserved it. Shameless ingrates! Really? Me and my sister are ingrates? Shameless? Look behind you. Look at the women your brother has mistreated. Call the police. I won't run away. Tell them I'm just in my room… doing splits with flying colors. Miss Lilith, I just need to spray around. He might smell. I don't think the undertakers will be here until tomorrow. All right. My condolences, ma'am. What a surprise, you and Don Valentin getting hitched. I kept it a secret. I couldn't believe it myself. I'm still wondering what he saw in me, the butler. What happened was devastating. But Miss Lilith, I think it was good that we were able to know who did it. But something's bothering me. Lady H used rat poison on him. But look at the corpse. It's pink. That's the effect of cyanide, not rat poison. Cyanide? Yes. Why do you know that? Well, I'm a fan of Sherlock. The British TV show? - No, Miss Lilith. - How posh. The Filipino detective TV series with a talking dog. It's called Sherlock Jr. I'm a GabRu fan. It's the love team of Gabbi Garcia and Ruru Madrid. Gosh, they looked good together! But they split up after their show. I learned so much about solving murder cases because of that show. I'm sure of it, Miss Lilith. Google it. Pink is the sign of cyanide poisoning. My God. How can you still have an appetite after what you did? Of course, Coco, you booger. I can never say no to fried fish! I cannot forgive you for what you did. He was a father to me. He understood me like no other man before. Believe it or not, he was my first and only love. He believed in my predictions. So now we're giving him a tribute? You're praising a dead man who played with your feelings? Ladies, how low can you all get? Can you stop playing the butler? Aren't there other servants around here? They all left last night to help their families relocate after the storm. Whatever. Just stay away from me, Meredith! - Lilith! - Okay, Lilith! Good morning. Good morning. Magenta, what's wrong? Every time I see you, I can't believe Valentin is gone. Then follow him to his grave. They say that even identical twins are different from each other. But last night, when I was staring at you, I was seeing Valentin. He's here! He's beside you. Who? Valentin. For real? - Oh my God. What did he say? - Valentin, hi. - You're joking again. - He's saying something. - I can't hear him. - Shh. Listen carefully. Well, I'll talk to you later. Why don't you have coffee first, so you'll wake up from dreaming? But anyway, the police won't arrive until later. No one leaves until they do. What? And since we have nothing to do, let's talk. About what? According to the maids, you all met with Valentin around 4:00 p.m. Then, you went to your rooms. You all came down to dinner at 8:00 p.m. What were you doing from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.? Are we in the Big Brother house now? - You need to know our every move? - Yeah? - I know, right? - Why… you really are Helga's echo. I know, right! I really think my brother died because of your endless bickering. Amazing! My rich brother died mysteriously. It's natural for me to investigate what happened, especially if what this amoeba said is true. Well, I was in my room… sleeping the whole time. I saw you talking to Valentin. I think that was after 6:00 p.m. You must be dreaming. With all that gold, you're hard to miss. Besides, someone else saw you too. I was in Valentin's office. I was browsing his book collection while waiting for him. I'm a bookworm myself if you want to know. I love reading and re-reading classics! The Great Gatsby, War and Peace, Noli Me Tángere. All that jazz. Madame. Madame, I'm sorry. That's mine. I left it there. - I'm sorry. - Thank you, madame. Or to boost your ego in front of your harem? Men like you should be castrated. This is too much, Valentin! So… You were there. You saw what I saw. Yes, madame. So… What were you and Valentin arguing about? You said you slept the whole afternoon. Why do you need to lie? I don't owe anybody any explanation. If Lady H had not confessed to the crime, - I would think you did it. - Shut up. You're just a bitch. I'm a super bitch. Me, a bitch? Just because I spoke my mind? - Double bitch! - Triple bitch! Bitch to the fourth power! Bitch to the tenth power! Period! No erasure! Padlocked! I've swallowed the key! We're done. Oh my God. What was that? I already swallowed the key. That means we're finished. I'm outta here. Crown her already! I'm not keeping any secrets, unlike some people here. Well… We may have our differences, but I know Doctor Helga. I was her assistant for a long time. She's a devil, a monster, selfish, heartless, soulless, a bitch, a wannabe diva… but she is not a liar. - In fairness! - Thank you! I think. Mesdames, Madame Helga left out some things in her story. Oh, really? What is it? What is it? When I went back to the study to get my book, I didn't expect to see Madame Helga there. Madame? She was holding the tablet dispenser of Don Valentin. Madame? I'm sorry. That's mine. - I just left it here. - Sorry. Oh, my, my. Excuse me. Don't go making up stories. I was nowhere near Valentin's tablet dispenser. But madame, that's what I saw. Fuck off! - Oh my God! - You know nothing! Do you see everything? You fucker! What a dirty mouth! Nobody curses me at home. How dare she! Wait, I'm confused. Lady H has already confessed. But it seems others are guilty too? Because? Frankly, I think we're just wasting our time. We kept on arguing here when that fag already confessed. - You're right. - She called you a fag. - Girl, she meant you! - Me? Oh, my dear! If you don't want me to squish that mole of yours in your cheeks, I am not a fag. I am queer, not gay. My pronouns are "they" and "them". And most importantly, I have a name. Okay. I'm sorry, Lady H. Mx. Lady H to you and to that mole on your cheeks. Okay. Shut up. Other than Helga and Babet, did anyone else go to Valentin's study? I did… that night. Why? At around 7:00 p.m., I received a text message from Don Valentin. He forgot his tablet dispenser in his study, so I had to bring it to his room. Valentin! My love. I brought your medicine. Valentin! If Valentin left the tablet dispenser in his office and Lilith brought them late, it's possible for anyone to have sneaked into the room and to have switched the medicine with poison. Just like what I did. I therefore conclude that all of you… are suspects! - Not me. - Here we go again. Can we please stop portraying women as vengeful bitches? We had our differences with Valentin, but it doesn't make us killers. And honestly, when I learned that he might marry one of us, I didn't want him to die. I wanted him to live and choose me. What? You? If there are people I want to see dead, that's all of you. What?! Because all of you are my competition. You look constipated. Wait, are we done here? - I want to take a bath. It's so hot! - Me too! I'm sorry, mesdames. I hope you won't curse me for this, but due to the storm yesterday, power and water have been temporarily cut off. What?! No water? No electricity? No generator? Okay, fine! Let's just dance! Because? It's a bright, sunny day! A day in the light of the sun. This is how I begin my day, an hour of tender, loving care in the eight o'clock sunshine. This is the secret to my youthful complexion. Feels like we're just beside the pool. Oh my God, Diva! Of course we're beside the pool. Maybe you got sunstroke. Excuse me. We're in front of the swimming pool, not beside it, idiot. She has a point. Anyone can mistake this as the side of the pool, and over there is the front. We are not in front! The other side is the front. If that is the front, then we are at the back, not at the side. Come to think of it, we might actually be beside the pool, and that is the front! Damn it! The pool is a bigger problem than the pandemic? - It's just a stupid swimming pool, okay? - Okay. Fine. I say we're still beside the swimming pool! Oh, will you shut up! - True! - Shut up! Throw her into the pool so she knows where we are. Yes, do it now! Don Constantin! Can we talk? Can't that wait? I have to get changed for Coco's Zumba class. They can still go dancing after what happened to Don Valentin? Well, people cope in different ways, Lilith. For all we know, they may still be in shock. Wow, amazing. I can see that you really loved my brother Valentin. And now I can see why he chose you. You have a good soul, Lilith. Good you started the conversation earlier about Don Valentin's death. Chiclet and I discovered something last night. He didn't die because of rat poison. It was… cyanide. Cyanide? Yes, Don Constantin. The body turned pink. That's one of the obvious signs of cyanide poisoning. It wasn't just Lady H who left poison in the dispenser. We need to know who it was. What's the motive? Each mistress is getting 200 million pesos when Don Valentin dies. Lilith… you know what is written in the last will and testament of Valentin? That means you also know you will be getting all his remaining wealth. That means you're going to be a very, very rich girl, Lilith. In fact… you have the biggest motive for killing Valentin. And you? You have no motive? Didn't you get angry when you found out he left you nothing? I don't need Valentin's money, Lilith. Anyway… let the police investigate if there was someone else who could have done it. In the meantime, we need to be careful. Do you want to follow Valentin, Lilith? I don't care if Constantin doesn't want to investigate. No one can stop me. I support you, Miss Lilith. Good that you thought of coming back here. This is what Siri would do too. Siri? The talking dog in that show, Sherlock Jr. Siri can find evidence when he goes back to the scene of the crime, and that's how he solves the case. The jewelry is gone. They left this behind. Miss Lilith, can I just have this? - What is that? - Vibrator. Made in China. If only I saw everything that happened here last night. Then I would have a better idea of what to look for. Miss Lilith, I took a video. - Really? - Yes, here it is. I was laughing so hard because the mistresses were all screaming. You'd think they were at a BTS concert. They were all crazy. Can someone check what happened? Is he still alive? What I don't understand is… when Valentin died, how come… how come when the lights went back on… his position on the floor changed. Miss Lilith. Are you okay? It's all coming back to me now. I'm having a hard time accepting it. Let's go. There's nothing more to see here. Okay. What is that? What is it, Miss Lilith? This is Valentin's missing cuff link. Incredible, Miss Lilith. Nothing escapes your blue eyes. But how did this get here? Please hold this. Miss Lilith! Miss Lilith! Did you know there's a door here? No! It's my first time seeing this. Let me see. Miss Lilith, there are stairs at the end. Miss Lilith, there might be ghosts there! Wow. It's better than the horror house in Star City. I worked here for so long, but I never knew about that. Are you okay, Miss Lilith? What are you doing? I need to smell his armpit. Why? This is where we'll know the truth. In Don Valentin's armpit? Stop asking questions. Help me. Okay. Miss Lilith? Does it stink? This is not Don Valentin. Peppermint with 24-hour protection is the deodorant he used. That's why something was off when I hugged the corpse. It had no scent. Before I left him last night, I could still smell the scent of fresh peppermint with a hint of ripe cucumber and juniper berries. Are you sure about what you're saying, Miss Lilith? - Smell it. - No! I don't want to! You need to smell it to confirm it. No, I'm okay. No need. No! But if… if this isn't Don Valentin, then that means… There's another way to prove if this is Don Valentin. He has a birthmark on his butt. His butt? - Miss Lilith, his butt, really? - Help me. Wait. We are disrespecting the dead! There's no birthmark! Oh God. My God, it's flawless! What soap does he use? This is not Valentin! Lilith? Lilith? Why are you here? We just checked on Don Valentin because the morticians are taking so long. I thought I said something wrong. Forgive me and my big mouth. Sometimes, I cross the line. I'm used to it. You're just like Don Valentin. Well, Coco is teaching Zumba outside. Good for relieving stress. Come on, join us! Okay. I'll follow. I just… have to do something. Okay. One, two, three, aw. Five, six, seven, aw. - Ha, ha, ha, three. - Woo! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Mesdames! Mesdames! - Power is back. - And so? You can now use the jacuzzi and other facilities. Hey! Hey! Hey! - Ladies, come on. Don't go. - Let's go! - Ha? - In the spa. But I just got here! I just got here. Come on, let's Zumba! Coco! Let's go Zumba. Ladies, let's bring it on! Yeah! Five, six, seven, eight… - One, two, three, four. One, two… - One, two, three, four. One more time! One, two, three, four. One, two… These past few months… There's been a lot on my mind. I saw the error of my ways. And so I invited you all here. Because I want to make it up to you. If you will allow me. Amazing! I thought I died and went to heaven! Come to daddy! I can't wait to tell everyone about you. I know everything that's happening in his life. Bring it in! And tonight, I will begin to change. And I'm saying goodbye. I want to start again. You were just standing there? Miss Lilith, you slammed the door on me because you said you needed to be alone and think. Sorry. Were you waiting long? That's okay. It was just five minutes. I think I know what happened. But we need to make sure that the body is Valentin's, not Constantin's. But Miss Lilith, we already disrespected the body. Isn't the missing birthmark enough? And the smell of peppermint with a hint of ripe cucumbers and juniper berries? There's one more way. Valentin's mouth gets swollen whenever he eats nuts. Really? With all his women, he is allergic to nuts? That looks delicious. It's so hot. Have a snack first. We made cucumber sandwiches. - This one is for you, Don Constantin. - You have my sandwich. That's my favorite. Wait, this is for Don Constantin. - I already touched it. - Just get a new one. - I want this one. - That's not for you. I want this! - There are more, madame. - Give me that! Lilith, it's okay, just give that to her. I put more cucumbers in it, just for you. Oh, I see. When it's for him, you're so generous. But you scrimp when it's for us. Yeah, why is that? There, will you get it back? Miss Lilith, I have one more cucumber sandwich. This also has more cucumbers. Thank you, Chiclet. Thank you. I'm going back to my room to rest. I will just take a nap. When I wake up, I will eat this. But it tastes better when it's fresh. That's okay, Lilith. I am not picky with my food. Hey, Lilith! It's time to confess. How did you seduce Valentin? What did you remove first? Your bra? Your panties? Or your conscience? Rub-a-dub-dub, another bitch in the tub! Ten mistresses is a crowd, so stop competing with us. Number one, in the Bible, there are Ten Commandments. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Before you opened your legs, you should have opened that book. - Mesdames… - What is it? - …listen to me well. - Okay. First, I did not remove my panties because I don't wear panties. That's why it smells fishy! Second, rub-a-dub-dub to you too. I'm not competing with any of you. Third, based on my research, I am not a mistress like all of you. Valentin and I got together after his wife died. So we are not on the same level. You are just bananas. I am a banana foster sundae. Excuse me. You blue-eyed mascot without panties. I admit, we are mere bananas. But of all the plants in the Philippines, only bananas have a heart. - Know that. - Only bananas! Wait, mesdames. Miss Lilith is not the enemy. You shouldn't be fighting among yourselves because all of you are victims of Don Valentin. Miss Lilith, you should tell them what we discovered. - What? - What did you two discover? What is that? Don Valentin is not dead. The whole night he made you believe he was there at the dining hall. But you were so busy opening gifts that you didn't notice the Valentin who was on the screens was just a recording. While you were all busy, he left thru a secret passage to his room. From there, he went to the guest room where Constantin was. I believe this is where Valentin killed Constantin. Oh! Yo! My amazing brother! Why are you here? I thought the dinner already started. My brother. We seldom see each other. So it's just fitting that I welcome you here. Sure. When Constantin was dead, Valentin brought the body to his room. And here he changed his clothes to match what he was wearing. Then he brought the body to the dining hall and placed it so he could easily pull it out. I hope you're enjoying your gifts so far, ladies. The tablet dispenser was left in the office for a long time. Valentin took no chances. For sure he replaced all the tablets. When he pretended to be poisoned and unable to breathe, he fell right beside the door of the secret passage. He knew the exact time I set for the birthday cake. That was the moment he was waiting for. Because then, the lights would go out. When that happened, he quickly pulled out the body then he went inside. Oh, my! What an imagination! You know what? You can be a speech writer for politicians. Or a speech writer for political candidates. That's the same thing. Do you think it's easy to accept that I was deceived by the man I was supposed to marry? Miss Lilith is not making this up. We examined Don Valentin's body. We saw his butt. Glass-skinned. Flawless. No birthmark. It's not Valentin if there's no egg-shaped birthmark on his butt. He said that's the only difference between him and Constantin. You should have mentioned the missing birthmark earlier! So that means I did not kill Valentin. But why would Valentin kill Constantin? It doesn't make sense. For now, it doesn't make sense. But as Siri always says… - Siri? - …first, the motive, then the killer. Things will make sense once we know the motive of Don Valentin. Oh my God, that's so easy! Let's look for his diary. I'm sure it's all there! A diary? Are you serious? Actually… Don Valentin did mention to me that he kept a diary. See? He had a diary. Miss Lilith, the mistresses went crazy. Look what they did. Hey Lilith, where did you go? We've been busy looking, but we can't find any diary. I looked inside Valentin's room. - There's no diary there either. - What? Oh my God. So what will we do when he wakes up from his nap time? Let's just wait for the police before we confront him. All right? Wait, wait! If it is true that he killed his own brother, can you imagine what he could do to us? - Valentin! - No! We're talking about Valentin here. Can you imagine? He is a womanizer, but he can't be a murderer! Why do we bother looking for this diary when we can simply confront him? You really plan to just ask him? Who else? Should we just talk to the corpse instead? Wait! The crystal ball is revealing something. - Here we go again. - What? What? Valentin doesn't have a diary. There is no diary! There is a diary! Valentin's diary is here. That's not true! He sends text messages to himself. - What? - Such an effort! Wait, read it. Now! Not here. Valentin might catch us. Here. He texted about his birthday. Okay. "Invited my mistresses to my birthday." "I'm excited. I have so many surprises for them." Isn't that like Twitter with limited characters? But isn't that what old people use because it's easier for them? Wait! This? Is this what you're referring to? For your information, Twitter has 140 characters. This has 459. Now who are you calling old? It seems impossible that Valentin would put his motive for killing in a text. "Because of a secret, I plan to kill Constantin on our birthday." Did he really say that? Give me that. I need to see it myself. Okay, read. - Here it is. - Yes. "Thirty years ago, Constantin and I planned to kill our father to get our inheritance, but Constantin backed out." "I was the one who did it." "I still gave Constantin his share, so he would keep quiet." "But during the pandemic, Constantin changed." "He became religious." "He tried to convince me to confess." "I don't want to go to jail. Me kill him." "Me kill him"? He ran out of space. I have a bad feeling about this! Give me that! Bitch, I'm reading it. Listen to me. "I will make it look like I was the one who was murdered." "I will assume the identity of Constantin." Valentin is so mean! "This way, I will never be caught for murdering my father and for the murder of my brother!" "Even if the truth comes out, I will never be arrested because in the eyes of the law, I am already dead!" "I will plant poison in the rooms of Babet and Helga to frame them as my killers." Wait! Why me? Why us? "Because when I played FLAMES with our names their names turned up as enemies." FLAMES?! Really?! What are we? Grade-schoolers? Wait! - Where are you going? - I will look for that poison! Me too! Damn FLAMES! I believed that! I believed Valentin and I were the perfect match! F for Forever! Oh my God, sis! You idiot! There is no Forever in FLAMES! F is for Friends, not Forever! That's what Valentin said! Does that mean… he was lying to me? "He was lying to me?" I want to stab her in the lungs! Did you just realize it now? Girl, continue reading. Let us continue. "I'm leaving most of my fortune to Lilith." What?! "This woman is easily fooled." "I can make her love me as Constantin, and then I can get everything back." Oh no! He said that? That's not the Valentin I knew. I can't believe he chose a 3310 as his diary instead of an N95. - He's old. - Yeah, you're right. It's him! He ate the cucumber sandwich! - What do you mean? - That means he really is Don Valentin! - Because? - He is having an allergy attack, so he can't talk because of the nuts we put in the sandwich! Valentin, how could you? I believed that you loved me. But you just used me for your evil plan. Enough with the lies. We know the truth! We read your diary! Liar! You son of a bitch! Liar! Cheater! Asshole! Lying bastard! - Fuck you! - Demon! Oh my God! Get out of the way! Sis. There she is. Lilith! Oh my God! Miss Lilith… I received a call from the manager of the funeral parlor. They'll be here in a few minutes. The police too. I prepared tea and crumpets in the breakfast room. Would you like a snack, miss? I'll be there soon. All right. Don't be like me. Promise me, Lilith. When you love someone, save some for yourself. Thank you. I wouldn't have been able to last so long and survive Valentin's cruelty without you by my side. Charo. Ladies, I just want to apologize for how I treated you. I let my emotions get the best of me just because I wanted Valentin to choose me. And for that, I am so sorry. - Me too. I am so sorry. - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Magenta. Rest in peace to the dead. Mesdames, what are you doing here? There's tea and crumpets in the breakfast room. Do you want some? His face. It's a mess. We wanted to see him for the last time… but not in this state. I'm sorry, but I just have a question. Did you really love this man? I mean, did you really love Don Valentin? It's hard to admit. I know Valentin was an asshole, but… I didn't know he could do horrible things. But despite all his flaws, he made us happy. Mesdames, I have a suggestion. Would you like to have a moment with Don Constantin instead? He's in the other room. It's the same face. Do you want to come with me? Let's go! Here he is, mesdames. Why is he lying there, butt up? Our bad. We were interrupted by Don Valentin's arrival while putting Don Constantin on his back. But damn, his butt is so smooth. Let's put his pants back on. Sure. Wait, madame. It's quite tight. Ouch! Sorry. Why? Hang on. I thought this was Constantin. If he has a birthmark on his butt, then all this time, the dead body was Don Valentin. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Are you thinking about it too, mesdames? His butt just became hotter! It's so smooth. If this is Valentin and his twin is also dead, then someone is responsible for their deaths. - Lilith! - There's Lilith! We've been waiting for you! - Right. Have some crumpets. - Lilith, have some. Here you go. Thank you so much. Thank you. No, Lilith. We should be thanking you. Yes. Lilith, you helped us see Valentin's true nature. That's right. We all allowed ourselves to be fooled by his false promises. Right? Right. Even I feel embarrassed. I failed to identify the killer. But don't worry. Maybe next time? I promise to do better. There are other chances next time! Let's not beat ourselves up. Let's just remember not to let anyone fool us ever again. That's right! No. Never. Well, well, well, well. What? What's happening? If there is anyone better at lying, it wasn't Valentin… but that woman! - Madame? - Don't call me "madame"! Answer my question! - But what's the question? - She's right. You made us believe that you also loved Valentin. Didn't you? Miss, how could you? I admired you like a queen. You can cook rice without dipping your fingers to measure the water. - I can't relate. - You just eyeball it. But you had me fooled. You fooled us all. Chiclet… What are you talking about? The corpse upstairs has an egg-shaped birthmark on his butt. We were made to believe it was Constantin. But in truth, it was really Valentin all along! It's Valentin! We were made to believe that it was Constantin… Because he didn't have a birthmark on his butt… But he has one because it's really Valentin! - What?! - That was Valentin?! But we were made to believe that it was Constantin… That at we thought it was Valentin… Damn it, enough! We get it, okay? For me, it's somewhat… Talk to us, Lilith. Woman to woman. We're always being fooled by men. For once, let's be honest with each other. Please, Lilith. You killed them for money. Admit it. Is that true? You killed them for the money? I asked you all to gather here today because I have something to confess. We're here for the tea and crumpets, not you. Indeed. To understand why I did what I did, I have to tell you how important Charo was to me. Valentin's wife? Charo? - It started when… - Shut up. What's happening? Is she high? I want what she is having! I'm just feeling gassy. May I continue? So here's what happened. What is it? I was only 20 years old when I came to work for this house. An orphan. No other relations. Charo treated me as her own. Wait! Did you have a romantic relationship with Charo? Is that the reason why you were so mad at Valentin? - We were just friends. - For real? Drop it! We understood each other. Charo! Before she died, she left one final instruction. When doing laundry, always separate whites and darks. Those are your last words? Make them pay. Make them all pay… for me. Charo! Since then, I started planning for revenge… a night that Valentin would never forget. Seducing a sexually deprived old man during lockdown was easy. Soon, I had him eating out of my hand. I convinced him to invite all of you and his brother Constantin to his birthday party. From the beginning, my plan was simple. I was going to replace his meds with poison. But… why did you have to kill Constantin too? He is even worse than Valentin! When they were younger, he pretended to be Valentin to take advantage of Charo in bed. - Oh my God! - And Valentin knew about it! I played them like they played Charo. What about the diary entries you showed us? Did you just make them up? And you also planted the poison in our rooms? Is that true? Yes. I planned it all. I wanted to make Valentin and Constantin pay for what they did. The poisoned pills were already in the tablet dispenser when I gave it to him. The moment the poison took effect, he would think he was having an asthma attack. I knew he'd try to go to his room to get his meds. While no one else was looking, I changed the position of Valentin's body. I did a few things to make it appear that it wasn't Valentin who died. I replaced his deodorant… unscented instead of the usual peppermint with a hint of ripe cucumbers and juniper berries. I purposely didn't put on the other cuff link. I stuck it by the door of the secret passageway. Later, I made sure Chiclet was with me when I discovered it. And for the coup de gras, I covered Valentin's egg-shaped birthmark with makeup. - That's why. - Wait, I'm confused. Valentin was allergic to peanuts, right? And Constantin wasn't? But why did Constantin develop the same symptoms when he attacked us in the garden? - Good point! - Right? Do you remember that I came last when you were looking for the diary in Valentin's office? Go on. That's because I went to Constantin's room. While he was sleeping, I poured Elmer's Super Glue all over his lips. And I took a video selfie while at it. That's what I showed him to make him furious. We read your diary! In the commotion, nobody noticed it was a different phone. Murderer! Liar! Yes, I am the mastermind! Wow. I just fulfilled my promise. I made them pay the debt they owed Charo. The police will arrive soon. I am ready to face them. I am willing to face the consequences of my actions. Look at what Valentin turned us into. We were like dolls he collected. We did hideous things to ourselves to get his attention. He pitted us against each other! Let's stop this nonsense! Lilith, thank you for telling the truth. If Lilith goes to jail, then I'll join her. Valentin also drank the poison I left in the tablet dispenser. I also have a confession to make. When Chiclet saw me with the tablet dispenser… I did actually put poison in it. I knew Valentin wouldn't choose to marry me. But you said you weren't like the rest of us bitches fighting for scraps. I only said that to have a little bit of dignity. Do you know what it feels like to be an aging mistress? To be constantly reminded that I'm no longer enough? And how do you think I feel? I was the original mistress. The first one he discarded and repeatedly replaced since then. I thought I was special because… I gave him a child. But it meant nothing to him. Yes, it meant nothing. None of us meant anything to him. What kind of man would gather all his mistresses only to shame them? And what kind of man would subject his new bride to the scorn of the mistresses he has rejected? Our love for him was not enough. No. Our love was more than enough. It was him who didn't appreciate us enough. I also have a confession to make. Before Helga saw me talking to Valentin… I went to his office earlier. I replaced some of the pills with poison. You too? You know, actually, because of how much poison Valentin drank, all of us can be accused of murdering him. We all have motives for revenge. Even if what you're saying is true, what we did was not revenge. It was a revolution. Right. If there is anything I regret, it was hurting his wife. Can you imagine how Charo felt every time Valentin had a new mistress? We hurt another woman. She died not just because of what Constantin and Valentin did to her, but also because of what we made her feel. Aura? What is it this time? There she goes again. - She's here. - Who? Charo is here. Where?! She's been listening to us. Oh no! Any message for her? Dear Charo! If you are really here with us, then let us feel your presence! Stop it, Aura! Dear Charo… if you are really here with us, then show yourself. Wait! Wait! Wait, wait… Please don't! But… before she leaves, please tell her that I am sorry. Me too! Charo, rest in peace! What now? - She has a message for us. - What?! Fuck all of you! But we're all forgiven. - Thank you, Charo. - We're so sorry. Can you see her? Where is she? Girl, drop it! It isn't funny anymore. Lilith… when the police arrive… what should we tell them? What? Just tell them one thing. Once they arrive, we'll tell them that finally… we are free.
