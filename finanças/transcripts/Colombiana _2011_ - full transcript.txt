I can't believe this. Why not? Because I love you, Fabio, like a son. I love you, Don Luis, like a father. I'm going to miss you. And I'm going to miss you. Okay. Enough of this sentimental bullshit. One last drink? Next we'll be crying like two old women. Come on! To the future. So business is all clear? It's all here. No other copies? You have to ask? Hey, hey, hey. Oh, come on, eh? I'm going to miss you. Adi?s, Marco. Kill this motherfucker. Not okay, boss? The bastard thinks I'm an idiot, playing it mellow. If he screamed and threatened to kill my family, it would've been better! We have an hour to get out of here at the most. We've got 10 minutes. Cataleya, go pack. I'm packed, Mama. Cataleya. In case anything happens, this-- This is your passport. You find yourself alone, you go to the address on this card, you show it to the man at the gate. I don't understand, Papa. Cata, you don't have to understand. You just have to listen and remember. Now... And this, this will keep you safe. The Cattleya orchid. My mother, your grandmother, used to grow them. Every morning, I'd wake up to the sight of them, the smell of them. That's why I named you Cataleya. Never forget where you came from. We want to see Don Fabio. He is not home. I'm ready. Back! Back! Back! He said he's not home yet. Wait a minute. It's too late. Get ready. Go. Go. I love you very much. I love you too, Papa. Do it now. Okay. Change of plans. Cata. Alicia! Fabio... ...you should know that you don't leave Don Luis. Only die. Hey, what are you doing? Don Luis said kill everyone. He also said no names. She won't remember. She's a kid. So what? What do you mean, "So what?" Hm? What do you mean? Do you remember me, Cataleya? I was at your confirmation. My name is Marco, and I was a very good friend of your father. You know who Don Luis is, right? He was like a father to your father. That makes you family too. But when someone is good to you and you're not good to them back, then bad things happen. You do very well in school. So I know this is not too complicated for you. Am I right? Excellent. Now, your father had something that belonged to Don Luis. IFS a small thing, not bigger than this. Do you know where it is? Well, if you give it to me, Don Luis will be very happy and very grateful. So why don't you just give me that little thing which belongs to him? Would you do that? You're a smart girl, and in this life, smart girls always get what they want. Hm? So just tell me. Just tell me, sweetheart. What do you want? Aah! To kill Don Luis. Get that little bitch! We need her alive! Find her! Find the little bitch! Eh? Alive. Got you. Quick! Get her! Go! Quick! Shit! Excuse me. And you say you have something for us, sweetie? Well, may I see it? Jesus. Um... Everybody, take a Eve-minute coffee break. Jim, we're going to have to record this. Where did you get this, sweetie? My papa. And where is your papa? Dead. Do you know what this is? Yes. My passport. We're about to arrive in Miami. Let me buckle you up. Welcome to America. Go ahead. I'll wait right here. Cataleya? Hello, young lady. Where are we wanting to go today? Chicago. It's not just down the street, you know. How much? Hey, kid. What are you doing here? Emilio. Emilio. Emilio. There's a girl looking for you. Her name is Cataleya. Cataleya. I thought you were dead. You're safe. It's okay. You're safe now. You're safe. --Still locked in a bitter battle over the budget. You have your mothers beautiful eyes. Don't be afraid. This is your home. How long has it been since you sleep? I don't know. A long time ago. Wen, good. A young body needs to sleep. When I was your age, I would sleep half the day. I don't know if it helped with the growing, but I was always ready for what came after. Whose room did I sleep in? My son. Your cousin. Where is he? He's dead. Killed? Yes. By who? No one who is still alive. You are very talented. Is this what you want to be, an artist? I used to want to be like Xena. Warrior princess. Not anymore? Now? I wan (to be a killer. Can you help? Sure. Normally, we don't accept students in the middle of the academic year. But under these circumstances, losing her parents in this tragic car accident... Here you are. These are the school supplies you will need. - Sorry. She's a little traumatized. Of course. We'll see you Monday, Cataleya. Such a pretty name. After we get this stuff, we'll go to Maxwell Street to get a hot dog from the Polish people. You like hot dogs? Hey. What is it now? That school has nothing to teach me. I told you what I want. You don't want to help me? Fine. I'll do it myself. Look. Stop! Run! Like that? That's what you want? You want me to teach you how to be a killer? No problem. I teach you. But you'll be dead in five years. If you want to be a killer and survive, you got to be a smart one. Have to know things besides how to pull a trigger. You have to know how people think. You got to learn how to be psychological. I cannot teach you that unless you learn the basics at a school. You got that? Hm? Come on, what's it going to be? Cataleya, you choose. Come on. Now. Choose. Come on. What you want? Choose. Bette F. Hey, buddy. I got the good stuff. So then I suggest, you know, let's buy some things, spice it up a bit. A garter belt, some of those stockings that come up to the thigh. Right, nice. It's been 14 years. You know? No matter how much I like steak, sometimes a lamb chop isn't a bad thing, right? Exactly. Oh, my God. Son of a bitch! Fuck, man. What the--? Put your hands on the car! Hands on the vehicle right now. Right now. Oh, bad-- You stupid crazy bitch. I'm really sorry. This is not-- it's not even my car. - This is funny? No, sir! I'll give you something to laugh about. I'm sor-- Officer, I'm sorry. I don't drink. What the--? Oh, hey. There's nothing here. No license, no registration, no ID. Except for a library card. Miss Valerie Phillips. In addition to all that, you are being charged with DUI, driving the wrong side of the road, and destruction of police property. Miss Phillips! Do I have your full attention? Yeah. That's it? Unless there's anything else you can think of. I have to throw up. Oh, no, no, no. Get her out of here! And a cup of coffee. We'll book her tomorrow. Let her sleep it off, for chrissakes. All right, big step. Down you come. All right, stretch those legs. Come on, move. Regis, check downstairs. She's from Roma. And she says to the other-- Excuse me. U.S. Marshal Warren. I'm here with Gennaro Rizzo on an overnight. Wait, hold a second. You know, it says here you're not expected until tomorrow. Never expect the expected, sergeant. Is that coffee there? Is that fresh? Yes, it is. Do you mind? Patrick. Appreciate it. Officer Doyle is gonna show you the Cell blocks. Oh, come on. Home, sweet home. After you, sir. I'm gonna miss you, Rizzo. I'll leave that there. Just in case you get hungry in the night. Sleep well. Be a caffeine kind of night, Joe. Keep your eyes open. --The count two balls and no strikes. He does have 24 home runs and... Two. One. Oh, f-- Not again. Hey, Doyle, go check the ventilation system, will you? As in today, please. Jesus Christ. Oh, Shit. Yeah? Yeah, I gotta pee. Unbutton your shirt. What? Now. Who are you? Not room service. Go! Come on! High-level security threat. - Come on! - Move! Move! Come on, move! Get inside! Somebody open the door! Look at me. Look at me. Give me the gun. Just give it to me, okay? It's okay. That's good. Move it! Hold him down! I didn't do it! You really gotta listen to me. - You got him? - Watch him! - Get him Out. - I didn't do it! Get him out! Call it in. I didn't do it! Call it in! Come on! Step aside! - Go, go! Come on, spread out, men. There! Check out the north side. It's clear here. Okay, okay, let's go. Agent Ross. Where is he? He's in the morgue. Let's go. This is just how he came in. It's the same handwriting. Same drawing, right? It's him. I want to see the location, please. Thank you. - Oh, I shouldn't drink. - No, you shouldn't. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. Yeah, you can tell that to the judge in 10 days' time at your hearing. Oh, my God. What's going on down there? Nothing. Sign this form. And then you can go. Really? But I'm sure the judge will send you back here. I probably deserve it. Yeah, well, you're just lucky no one got hurt. Marshal. Marshal! Okay, okay, back up. Was it an assassination? You didn't lock it down. It was after the fact. I didn't think anybody-- You have to do it. Nobody in, nobody out, please. Okay. You heard the man, lock it down. Nobody in, nobody out. When will there be a statement? Will the commissioner hold a press conference again? Yes or no? People need to know! I want to see paper on everybody in and out of this station in the last 24 hours. And I want the tapes from all the security cameras. All of them. We're good. When you are back? The day after tomorrow. Good. I have something for you. Give me a day. Okay. We can't wait to see you back. Give Mama a kiss for me. I will. Thank you. Twenty-two murders in the last four years, all with the same MO. Rm right. He is sending a message, but I believe it's not meant for us. We're the ones with the information. We're not getting anywhere with it. Put it out to the press. Its time. The word. This lipstick drawing. I want it splashed over every newspaper, magazine. Front page, national. If the message isn't meant for us, let's make sure it gets to who it's intended for. Mr. Richard. Hm. Marco. It's been a long time. It has. How is the hand? It only hurts when it's humid. Let us relocate you to Arizona instead of New Orleans. Yeah, right. But the boss likes it humid. He's waiting for you. Okay. What do you think? Hm? Coincidence. Twenty-two times? Flower that only grows in one place on earth. Uh, didn't that used to be the calling card of...? Shoot. I forgot his name. What was his name? Your partner? You know, the one who used to do your wet work. Fabio. Fabio. Fabio Mafia Restrepo. May I? The CIA is not an amusement park. When the agency extracted you from Colombia 15 years ago, and set you up here, we allowed you to resume your little business. What we should've done was lock you away for life. Now, in exchange, you should've kept the information flowing. And I have. Not much. I had nothing to do with this. Then find out who did. She's talking to us. Could be anyone. Idiot. I told you, everyone dead, down to the dog. You screwed up the first time. Now, go fix it. ? Deeper down? ? We're all goin' down? ? Down, deeper down, yeah? ? We are all plunging Straight towards our own decline? ? Without noticing We slide down, deeper down? ? Down? ? Down, deeper down, yeah? Each and every one of the victims was a professional bad apple. As for motive, I've narrowed it down to payback, but not much else. My best guess: Alexa Milshinova. She made a career out of getting intimate with high-stakes gamblers out of Vegas. She would rip them off and then send them to meet their maker. Here, DiAngelo James. He tried to take over the heroin trade from Houston from the Gemini cartel. If you do not know all there is to know about these twins, you should not be in this room. You see, he tilts the camera just enough so he won't be seen going into the cell. The time, 1:55 a.m. That means our perp was in that station that... I don't have to spell it out for you, do I? Excuse me. Hand these out, please. These are names, addresses and phone numbers of everyone with a pulse who was in that station before 1:55 a.m. Everyone. Which means one of them was our target. Locate the 10 people in the folder you've just been handed. I want a detailed dossier on each for the last 10 years of their lives. I want you to run down every lead. You will check every story. Our killer, ladies and gentlemen, is in those folders. And I mean to catch him before he kills again. Don't move. Hello, Jennifer. Hello, Danny. ? Get so tired? You haven't finished your painting. You never finish a painting. You just stop working on it. I know something you finish. Oh, yeah? Yeah. ? A thousand flowers? Tell me something. Will we ever go on a normal date? What's a normal date? You know, go out, have dinner, drink wine, get drunk. Mmm. Dessert? ? Give me a reason To love you? ? Give me a reason To want to be your man? ? Give me the reason to love you? ? Watch out, watch out? ? Timber? Safe? From my end. You? Safe. How's Mama? She is missing you. Tell her I miss her back. I think she would love to hear that from you. I know. What do we have? Remember the guy on the news running a Ponzi scheme about a year ago? Mm-hm. Made $50 million and vanished into thin air. Clever guy. Now he's living in the Caribbean. Oh. Mm. So left a lot of people very upset. So we give him a break. Permanently. Okay. There's something else. How long has this been going on? Not long. Newspaper says 22. Why? You know why. Think this will smoke Don Luis out? You think he's that stupid? It's not just about you, okay, Cataleya? There's me, Mama, the family. Tio, please. You're clean. You book the work, you collect the money. Oh. How nice. And I watch your back. That's what I do. Each and every job, I vet, I double-vet. If I give you a job, I turn down five, 10, because I made a promise to keep you safe. I keep you safe, Cataleya. That is a full-time job, no matter what you think. But this? It's not professional. I don't care about what's professional. I'm doing this my way. That is your way? Yeah. A Tag Killer? L should never have let you do this. Never. You didn't let me do anything. I chose this, remember? I chose this. From the moment I walked in your door, I had already made my decision. By yourself? Yes. Not you or anybody is going to change that. We love you, Cataleya. Then watch my back until it's done. Cattleya. Excuse me? It's an orchid. What? This is? Sure it is. It grows in Colombia. How do you know that? My wife, she's Colombian. Colombia. Uh... Cattleya? That's right. Okay. Let's try "organization" Well, shit. Hi, boys. Did you miss me? Yeah? Well, I missed you too. Hi. Come. You guys been good? Hm? All right, stay. Sirloin. Juicy. Delicious. Want one? Good. Eat. I know that song. I guess the boys gave me away, huh? You spoil them. I train them. ? If you're on the court alone? ? Hoop dreams? ? Try to give it all you got? ? Hoop dreams? ? Yo, it's 10:00 in the park Gettin' dark? ? But you still gotta hit this fast shot? ? Hoop dreams? J' Yo, I got this hoop dream Written all on my mind J' ? I'm 'bout to push rocks Orange with the black lines? ? Y'all know the deal I got dreams of dunks? Fishy, fishy. Willie! Why are they ignoring me? What? - Baby, you put one drop of blood in there, they'll be your biggest admirers. Really? Oh, yeah, baby. All the way down to your clean, stripped bones. Cool. Alejandro, you bring in extra security for tonight. Yes, sir. You make sure that we are shut down, tight. Yes, sir. Take care. Girls! Come to papa, huh? There are guys in the garden and guys out back. I want you three upstairs. - Yes, sir. Two on the roof. Hurry! What's this? Willie, come back to bed. Shh. What the fuck is it? Turn around. Who are you? It doesn't matter who I am. Okay, what do you want? I want you exactly where you are. Whatever they're paying, I'll double ii. Please, please don't kill me. I'm not gonna kill you. Eh--? Wha--? Oh. Oh, no, no. Please. Oh, no! [PHONE RINGING} Yeah? - Mn Steven Richard? Who is this? This is FBI Special Agent Ross. Look, I'm lead agent on a case. It's a serial we call the Tag Killer. You might have heard of him. I've seen the publicity. He marks his victims with a flower. It's from Colombia. The Cattleya orchid. Each time I try to access information, I get stuck with a CIA "access denied" tag. I'm at the end of a long road, Mr. Richard. I've been led to believe that you are the man-- Listen, Agent Ross. I can?t give any information out over the phone. I suggest you file a formal request with the agency for any information you might want. I'll be happy to get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Hello. Stop bullshitting me, Marco! I got the FBI on my ass now. I want that problem taken care of Do you hear me? Loud and clear. Good. Keep your baggage with you at all times. Where to? Downtown. And we question every Colombian we meet until we find an address to get her family, okay? Jen, in case you show up, I wanted to let you know that I went to New York to meet with galleries. I'll be back tomorrow, but if you're already here, make yourself at home. What do we got? We do have the surveillance tapes from a few angles. That's it? That's it. It's not a lot to go on. Come on. Run it through the database, see what happens. We're not looking for a woman. It's not possible. Wow. Wine? Thank you. Come. I'm impressed. I got you something. You did? Yeah. A stuffed alligator? Yeah. Exactly what I've always wanted. Hey, Wait. Wait, wait. Let's just, uh... Let's just sit, have this food and talk for a bit first. What do you want to talk about? I don't know. Anything. Ask me something. How was your trip? It was great. The gallery liked my paintings. They're gonna put up a show. That's good. Right? Yeah. My turn. How was your trip? Hot. Did you do anything exciting? I went swimming. Anything else? Come on, talk to me. What do you want to know? Anything. Something about you. Something. Where are you from? Are your parents from here in the city? Okay. Let's start with something a little more simple. What do you like to eat for breakfast? I don't eat breakfast. I'm not gonna hurt you. I want to know a little bit about you. About what you feel, what you feel about me. Anything. Just a little. I feel lonely sometimes. Thank you. Me too. Let me this time. Morning. You say you don't eat breakfast, So I thought I'd make lunch. Oh, my God. Oh, shit. Wait. Where you going? I shouldn't have done this. Done what? Any of it! I don't understand. Why? What are you talking about? Why? Because. Can you just hold on? Can we just talk about this? No, no, Danny. We've talked too much. Jennifer, just stay for a minute. I'm sorry, I have to go. Jennifer! I'm sorry I'm late. Eight people slaughtered in Miami. One of them is my friend. So what? You know exactly what. He's getting too close. Please, again with that? They're looking for you, so don't play with me. You're bringing them to you. I know how your twisted little mind works. Think this is a game? I'm a fucking joke to you? Hm? You scare me, Cataleya. I don't want to deal with your shit anymore. I don't want to give you work or anything anymore. YOU are retired. You can't do that. Lunatic! How many people did you kill when your boy died? What you know about my son? You know fucking nothing about my son. Bur it changed nothing. When I lose my son, I lose my life. Everything that's important to me is gone. But I want to believe in you, Cataleya. Why? I still pray that you find a life away from this, because no one in our entire family has a chance for one. Listen. Never come to the house, never come to the church. Don't bother. I don't want to wait for your phone call no more. I don't want you to break my mother's heart. Maybe this will help you to understand what I try to tell you. Five-six, brown eyes-- Well, hazel, actually. Dark hair, thick. Shiny. Incredible body, killer Smile. I think about her all day long. Dude, you're in love. You're so smart. Seriously, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, you're nuts. I haven't had anyone in my life for 10 years. I finally meet someone that I really like. That I want to be with all the time. I've got nothing. A stuffed animal and a picture. You got a picture? Give it up. It's not even a whole picture. I took it of her while she was sleeping. Oh, my God! Jesus, relax. When do I meet the future Mrs. Delaney? You? Never. Oh, shit. Ha, ha. Excuse me. Excuse me. Why are you writing a ticket? Third Precinct. - Hey, Shari. You got that picture? Hello, skinny face lying on my computer. Ooh. She's beautiful. Clearly out of your league. It's not for me, it's for Danny. Remember the painter? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Much better match. How long's this gonna take? Slow your roll. You're my brother-in-law, not my boss. I'm not supposed to do this. Shari, you are gonna be the fairy godmother in the most beautiful love story ever. Okay? Think about it. You get the honor of saying you made this all happen. And I get to lose my job if I get caught. Done. I'll call when I got something. Thank you, baby. He'll thank me later. I want a trace put on an incoming transmission. Chicago, Third Precinct. Get somebody down there now. That was such a nice surprise. Everyone grows up sometime. She's gonna be okay. Yes, Mama. I think so. Um, excuse me. - Come with me, please. That's my computer. Why--? Why are you on my computer? - Remain silent. You better not mess up my favorites. We need a common base, so let's try his eyes. Good. Now, let's see hands. Looking good. And now... Hm. Nice nose. Congratulations. You have a girl. Print it. Get it out to all stations. And get the mobile unit ready. Yes, Sir. Hello? It's me. Jen? Are you busy? No. No, I'm not. Danny Delaney. Localization in progress. I was just looking out the window and thinking. Where are you? I'm-- I'm at home. Looking out the window too. We're looking at the same sky now? Almost. You have a sexy voice on the phone. Yeah, you do too. Progress. We've got it. There it is. We got it. Give SWAT the location. Let's go! I'm really glad you called me. Me too. I was just looking at a picture of you when the phone rang. Picture? I took a picture of you sleeping with my phone. But I just wanted to have something to remind me of you. Did you show it to anybody? No. Well, actually, my friend Ryan. Who else saw the picture? - Nobody. Why? Danny, who else? I didn't show it to anybody. What's the big deal? I just took a picture with my phone. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Oh, fuck. See what we got. Special Agent Williams. FBI. It's clear. Shh. Unh. I mean, I really think, like, he was publicly humiliated... Everything's under control. I need you to come with us. We're evacuating the building. Copy. Ten-four. Charges. Blow it. No, she's not here. Lock down this building ASAP. Anything? No, nothing. No, wait, wait, wait. One security camera down. Second down. Where? The garage! All units, get to the garage. Let's go. Let's go. Cover all the damn exits. She's here! Look everywhere! Under every oar. Look in every boot. She's here. Find her! Anything? Come on. Check that boot. In here. Mama. Mama! Emilio! Emilio! I'm sorry. Thank you. This won't take long. Please, sit. You think you've been smart. Have you covered all your bases? Because this? This is already over. This whole place is wired with webcams. You mean these? Talk about covering all my bases. Your chair is pressure-wired. You move a single inch, it'll be the last move you ever make. And given what you know about me, you know I don't bluff. I don't know about you. So I'm just gonna ask. What happened to you that you could kill 23 people? Would you believe me if I told you this wasn't the life I had imagined when I was a child? I wanted to be like you, on the other side. Really? So, what happened? Luis Sandoval. I was 9 when he had my parents killed in front of me. So all this? The rag Killing, the clues weren't for us at all. It was all for him? Only way to track him down. You needed us to put it all in the press? Yes, but it took you so fucking long. Goddamn. You've had to be really determined. Very focused, huh? Not focused enough. This morning he took the last piece of me. You sent the man a message, he sent you one right back. And now I'm gonna finish it. Oh, I can't help you. Yes, he's protected by your government. By a part of my government that I cannot reach. It's CIA, and I don't know why, but I can't get under it. I can't get over it, and you have to believe me, I have tried. Try harder, Agent Ross. You have a beautiful family. You go anywhere near my family, and I swear to God, I will-- Shh. Now you know what you have to do. Get me Luis Sandoval. Because if you don't, you're going to go to a funeral every week, and I will not stop until you begin to feel what I felt all these years. I'm sorry. Cataleya. When your dinner's ready, the timer in your chair will have expired. Don't get up before. Hey! You do understand that I only took this meeting out of professional courtesy. NOW, the truth is, I really can't help you at all. Can't or won't? It's the same thing, really. But in the spirit of reaching out, let me put my cards on the table. Yeah? I have met this woman, this Tag Killer. It's a woman? Yeah. Is she pretty? She got the drop on me in my home, told me that if I don't bring her the whereabouts of this man, she's going to kill a member of my family every week until I have none left. Are you kidding me? Does it seem to you that I would make something like this up? So why don't you just tell me what I should do? Call 911. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting. It starts now. Ross. It's her. If you don't give her what she wants, she's going to redecorate your whole office. With you. Can you tell her that glass is tempered to resist a direct hit by a 57 mm ordinance? Ten seconds to give up that address. How can I be sure she won't kill me? She says you can't, but you can trust me. If you don't give her what she wants, you will be her 24th victim. Eight-six-seven Magnolia Terrace, New Orleans. She asked that you keep this conversation confidential. With pleasure. What about my family? Good morning. Who are you? That's not important. What's important is, I need the floor plans to 867 Magnolia Terrace. If you don't leave immediately, I will call the police. I really need those floor plans. You will take positions here, here and here. You must expect the unexpected. She's like mist under a door, like a mouse in the wall. She will never attack straight on, and you will not see her until it's too late. She's that invisible. Shit! Marco! Don Luis. Don Luis, are you okay? Get the Mercedes! What happened? We need to get out. Leave me alone! - Come on! Come on, come on! Everyone in! We have to move. Quick! Let's go! Hurry up. Come on. You hide here. Wait for my call. - Okay. Come on! Find her! And look everywhere! Hello. - Did you catch her? We're checking it. I think we got her. Marco! Marco! Marco! What the hell is going on? I will hold here. Marco! You've been waiting for this moment for a long time, right? Yes. Marco? CATALEYA I No. It's Cataleya. What were you expecting? You have ruined your whole life trying to kill me. Someone like me? I cannot be killed. I do the killing. And now it's your tum to be hunted. You will never find me. But as day follows night, believe me, I'll find you, and I will kill you! And you know why? Because I will never be where you want me to be. Actually... you're exactly where I want you to be. Huh? Aah! Eat. You should think very carefully. Is there anything else? I've already told you everything. She'd come by for a couple of hours, then she'd leave. It's late, I'm tired. If you are not gonna arrest me... We don't actually have anything to charge you with. So can I leave? No. I got a few more questions. Can I at least get a cup of coffee? Yeah. Cream and sugar? Yes, please. Hello? Hello? Jen. Thank God. Look, I had no idea. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine. Where are you? FBI. Danny, you know that they-- Yeah. How much time do we have? Forty seconds. Use this time for three questions. What's your real name? Cataleya. Like the flower? Yes. Like the flower. Twenty-two seconds. Will my little bird come back one day? Leave your window open and you'll see. Hey, Ross! Yeah? We're picking something up off that guy's phone. Last question. I love you. Give me that phone. Give it. Hello? Hello? You can go. ? I hurt myself today? ? To see if I still feel? ? I focus on the pain? ? The only thing that's real? ? The needle tears a hole? ? The old familiar sting? ? Try to kill it all away? ? But I remember everything? ? What have I become? ? My sweetest friend? ? Everyone I know? ? Goes away in the end? ? And you could have it all? ? My empire of dirt? ? I will let you down? ? I will make you hurt? ? I wear this crown of thorns? ? Upon my liar's chair? ? Full of broken thoughts? ? I cannot repair? ? Beneath the stains of time? ? The feelings disappear? ? You are someone else? ? I am still right here? ? What have I become? ? My sweetest friend? ? Everyone I know? ? Goes away in the end? ? And you could have it all? ? My empire of dirt? ? I will let you down? ? I will make you hurt? ? If I could start again? ? A million miles away? ? I would keep myself? ? I would find a way?
