TOHO COMPANY, LTD. A SHINNIHON Production MEIJI 35 (1902) WORLD'S GREATEST PRODUCTION OF RAW SILK CELEBRATION HALL Railroads, telegraphs, cannons, warships... During the Meiji period, Japan relied heavily on imports from the industrialized West. The raw silk industry enabled the acquisition of imports, helping to bring the progressive values of Western civilization and the European enlightenment to Japan.

Let's take a rest. Every year, girls head from Hida to the raw silk factories in Shinshu. Among these groups of girls are new trainees who are called "shinko." This is the entrance to Bijo Pass. You can't see Takayama beyond the pass. Everyone, it's goodbye to your fathers and mothers for quite some time. Father! Mother! I'm sad that I'm leaving them. Me too. Brings back memories. Cry now, not tomorrow. Let's go! The girls left Hida-Furukawa before dawn. They had to walk 160 km to Shinshu-Okayama in 3 nights and 4 days. After Bijo Pass, the town of Takayama disappeared. They walked along the Masuda River, further into the ravine. The girls passed Mangoku and stayed at Terazuki. Weather permitting, they went as far as Nakanojuku and spent the first night there. The next day they crossed Terasaka Pass via Kamigahoka. This area is called A dano, and it is deep in the mountains of Hida. And then, they would finally arrive at Nomugi Pass. Are you the Adachi Yamayasu party? That's right. I'm Yuki. So you're the one... the shinko from Adano. You're late. The girls you were to go with left yesterday. My mother died. When? Yesterday morning. I held her funeral. Your family? Only my father. Take me to the factory. All right. Join us. Let's go! Mother used to tell me she'd send me to Adano as punishment. I was told Adano was a horrible place. Her mother died, yet she has no tears. Girls in Adano are tough, aren't they? Listen! Don't let go of the rope! No matter what, hold it firmly until you cross the pass! Be careful. Don't stop or your toes will freeze. Keep walking! Walk steadily! Father! Mother! Don't fall asleep or you'll die! Mitsu! Hang in there! The shinko fell! Where? Rescue them! I'll go down. Everybody, take his rope! You go too! We paid a lot for those shinko! - Mine! - Hana! - Toki! - Mine! On my signal, pull the rope. All right. I'm counting on you. Toki! Be careful! Help them. YAMAYASU Pull. YAMAYASU Pull. Hang on tight! What are you talking about, fools? There's not even enough room for me to sleep. Least of all for you! You're a nuisance! You're as tough as ever. Hey! Don't steal my fish. That's for me to have with some sake. What are you whining about? The company paid for them. They only paid for the girls' food and bed. But... We'll pay you tomorrow. Just take them. Go on! Lousy slave dealers! Get out of here! Old hag! You're so stingy! Here's sake for you. Warm yourselves. We sleep outdoors tonight. The shinko who fell off the cliff, come here for amazake! Yes! Are you the girl who fell? Yes. You survived the fall from the ravine. You'll live a long life. Congratulations. Thank you. Be careful. You're only halfway there. Old silk spinners! Hurry up and come get some! You girls drink first, right? - Yes! - Yes! It's good. Hurry up! It's so good! Girls of Marusho! Help me make some rice balls! "Agreement for filature girls. Mine Masai, whose residence is in Kawai Village, Gifu. Born September 15, 1889. The above mentioned agrees to work as a filature girl at your mill on the following conditions. Starting March 1, Mine Masai shall work for five years as a filature girl at a silk mill for Yamayasu Company. Yamayasu pays five yen as down payment. During the period she shall not work at any other mills. Nor shall she take any other jobs." This part is really important. Listen closely. "In case of breach of the agreement, the undersigned shall reimburse the payment. and pay fifty yen without delay for compensation." It says fifty, not five. "In case she causes any loss to Yamayasu, the undersigned agrees to compensate for such losses anytime, upon request, without complaints." November... 1902... Listen, work hard. I'm sorry to make you work like this, but... Take care of yourself. After spending the first night at the inn on Nomugi Pass, there were many more mountains still awaiting them in Shinshu. It was like a caravan crossing the boundless range of Karakorum in Central Asia, along the Silk Road. On the second day, they had no time to enjoy a magnificent view of Mt. Norikura. They trudged through the mountains of Shinshu, passing Yoriaido, Nagawado and Shimashima, before spending the second night around Hatamura. The next day they passed Matsumoto and Shiojiri, reaching Shiojiri Pass after noon, and looked down at Okaya, their destination. The sea! Yes, the sea! It's my first time seeing the sea! - Me too! - Me too! Everyone, that's not the sea! It's a lake! It's Lake Suwa. It's a big lake, like the ocean. That's right. We're here at last. This is Shiojiri Pass. That's Lake Suwa. You all did well. Lake Suwa! We made it to Lake Suwa! YAMAYASU ADACHI GROUP FILATURE They're late! Is the telegram here yet? How many minutes has the clock been forwarded? Ten minutes. How much did you spend this year? Not very much. 20% more than last year. 20%? And yet the silk prices don't go up. We might go bankrupt. Master. - Look at the girls first before you complain. - Fool! I'm not a pimp. Line up over there. Thirty new shinko are here to pay their respects. Well, what do you know? This year's shinko are all lovely girls! Everyone, greet your master! Nice to meet you. I'm Yamayasu, and I manage the Adachi Group. Fate brought you to this mill. So consider me your father from now on. I'll consider you my precious daughters. All right? Now that we are like a family, obey my rules and do your best become good, capable workers. That's how to show filial piety to your parents. Understand? Answer if you do. Yes! Master! The telegram from Yokohama! The price went up! The price went up for raw silk! "Yokohama raw silk quotations. 1,025 yen. Expedite raw silk for export." Sayama! How much will we earn? Good. Minus commission? All right. Let's sell! Sell everything in the warehouse! We'll sell all the silk we have! Contact the shops in Yokohama! "Will send 50 bales of raw silk. Yamayasu Adachi Group." YOKOHAMA FOREIGN CONCESSION Raw silk was sent from silk mills in Shinshu and elsewhere in Japan to Yokohama to be sold to trading companies. It was then exported to Western countries via foreign mercantile firms. Get up, everybody! Start working! Everyone! Hurry up! Make haste! Hurry! Come on! Shinko, fold the bedding neatly! Yes! Damn witch! Are you from Hida? Yes, you? From Koshu. Towel! How long does it take?! Shinko don't need to wash their faces! Come on! Hurry! I can't hold it any longer. I can't hold it in! Wait till next time! You have to! Shinko, carry cocoons! Hurry, carry cocoons! What are you doing? Hurry! Hurry up! Fool! Be careful! I'm sorry! Pick them up. All of them. Yes! Cocoons are rice to you. Don't forget that you get to have free meals because cocoons produce raw silk and make money. Listen up! Treat them poorly and you'll be punished! Answer! - Yes! - Yes! Shinko, line up. I said line up! Yuki. Hurry. Straighten yourselves! You're all so slow! He's so mean to them. Once he enters the mill he's a devil. The shinko learned a lesson. Hey, move your hands, not lips! Stop crying! Watch how they spin silk. See how they move their fingers. Yes! If you can't stand the smell of pupas, you have no right working here! I'm sorry! This will be your smell. Stop! Understand? Do you, Kiku? Understand? Kiku! Are you okay? Wake her up with cold water! Hurry! Back to your posts! Yes! - You too! - Yes! Learn how to work from your seniors! Understood? Yes! MANCHURIAN PROBLEM AT A CRISIS RUSSIA CONTINUES PREPARATION NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA AND JAPAN STALL KATSURA CABINET STRUGGLES Morning, sir. How are the shinko? We're training them hard. There might be another war. The Russians underestimate us. The Americans and the English are also after Manchuria. I'm worried about the New York raw silk market. We must be careful. The price might drop tomorrow. They say the silk industry constantly faces death. - Morning. - Good morning. Be careful. Don't spill any. Don't spill any... I bet you look forward to the meals. Yes! The meals here are great! That's right. Only millet grows deep in the Hida mountains, so being able to eat white rice everyday must feel special. To the girls, wheat and rice meals were a delicacy. To go work at a mill meant not only money, but also fewer mouths to feed for poor farming families. 10 or 20 minutes for a meal. It was called the "filature girls' speed eating." - It's so good! - Yeah! BREAKFAST = 10 MINUTES LUNCH = 20 MINUTES SUPPER = 15 MINUTES SUWA SILK-REELING UNION SPECIAL MEETING The Russians want to invade Manchuria. They interfere with our rights in Korea. Their ambition is to conquer the Far East. We must stop them! But our government is weak. Prime Minister Katsura's diplomacy is unforgivable. Now is the time to strengthen our nation. Now is the time to produce more raw silk, so we can export more, and import weapons. Then we'll be able to fight Russia. We'll be able to punish the Russians. I'm sure we'll win. War's begun against Russia! War's begun against Russia! Terrible! It's war! WAR DECLARED! JAPAN WINS INITIAL BATTLES! Yes, we did it! We did it! We won! Everybody, listen! It's a great victory! Our navy destroyed the Russian Baltic Fleet! The war between Russia and Japan ended with a huge victory for our country! The warship that defeated the Russians was purchased via funds from the silk you reeled! Work harder from now on! Get to work! Get to work! Get to work! The best raw silk is Shinshu No. 1 Silk spinners earn foreign currency "What about the silk spinners?" they say Yes! Banzai! "What about the silk spinners?" they say Yes! Banzai! MEIJI 39 (1906) MEIJI 39 (1906) After the war, as the export of raw silk to America increased, so did the number of factories. After the war, as the export of raw silk to America increased, so did the number of factories. Coal replaced water as the source of power for factories, and hundreds of giant industrial chimneys went up in Suwa. They were dubbed "Suwa's 1,000 chimneys." I'm hungry. The results of the silk conditioning tests came in! The silk conditioning test was conducted using a French method. The diameter of the thread needed to match the standard. If it did not meet the standard, it was considered no good. The luster and links were also objects of judgment. Factory #3's output yesterday was 18 momme. Seven girls spun more than average. 16 did just average. 17 did below average. Clean your ears and listen attentively. There's a difference of 15 momme between the best and worst output. 15 momme per 4 sho of cocoons. You use 12 sho a day, so the difference will be 45 momme. Calculated in money, it's 3 yen a day. You work 200 days a year, so it's 600 yen. Do you think you're entitled to eat free rice when you're losing us 600 yen a year? Kire no mono... "Kire no mono" were those who failed to reel an average amount of silk per 4 sho of cocoons. As penalty, the shortage was taken from their pay. Mine Masai! Yes! 14 denier, 21 momme, glossy. 3 momme above average. 24 points! Well done. Your thread qualifies as Shinshu No.1. Then they'll be exported?! Sure. Absolutely. They'll pass inspection in Yokohama too. Next, Yuki Shinoda. Yes. 13 denier, glossy, no knots. 20 points. A little too thin, but the inspector was impressed. - Sir. - Yes? Are you sure it wasn't 14 denier? Please ask the inspector to re-examine it. Fool! The examination is fair. Especially for you and Mine. They're watching you two. The output surpassed Mine's. The best output of all. 25 momme. 7 momme above average. For those of you reeling everyday, let Mine and Yuki be your examples. Anything they can do, you can do too. Next, Kiku Shoji. Kiku! Yes. 15 denier, 21 momme, 3 momme above average. 13 points. That's great! Don't be too happy. I have something to talk to you about. Come to my room after work. Yes. Sir, what do you want with Kiku? - Hana Mishima! - Yes! Can't you work as well as you answer? 18 denier, 12 momme, 6 momme under average. Minus 12 points. I'm sorry. Threads as thick as this can't be used anywhere. Your fingers aren't nimble enough because you eat too much! Toki Hirai. Step out. Yes. The heaviest girl is the worst worker, like usual. Your threads are knotty, uneven, not glossy... I got an earful from the examiner. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. I hear you borrowed money from the cashier. My mother is ill. Then you just have to work harder. At this rate you won't be borrowing money again. Where do you think you're going? - The toilet. - What? She wets her pants when she's distressed. Damn you! Go to hell! That's a penalty too! Those of you with penalties this month get no lunch. Stand there and think about it! Master Haruo, I don't care if you stay overnight, but it's embarrassing that someone was sent over to collect the payment. My friends wanted to celebrate my repatriation. As the heir to this company, I have to be generous. Master Haruo, you just came back from the war alive. I'm not mad that you're having fun. But I need you to be aware of our family's reputation. I get it... I get it. Become a better businessman than your father. It costs a lot to forget about the war. Anyway... Pay him off. Here it is. Please take care of it. 45 yen in one night? That's so much! Welcome home. Welcome home. Well done, girls! Welcome home. Americans will be buying the silk you spun in no time. You did well. I'll ask the master to buy you two trousseaus someday. All right? You stayed out all night again... This is my son. He came back from the war. He'll work with us as my right-hand man. Young master, meet Mine and Yuki from Factory #3. Greet him. Listen, Haruo. They're good workers... they have a bright future. They bring us good luck. Who'll become a 100-yen worker first? Can't wait! Excuse me. I have a request. What is it? Name it and you'll have it. What do you want? Please forgive the penalized girls and let them eat! Mine! Please! Forgive them! What are you saying? Don't push your luck! Mine, apologize to the master! Father, feed them regularly. Young master! You can't work when you're hungry. It was the same in the army. Meals are all they have to look forward to. You shouldn't rob that. As if you know better! You can't be a good businessman that way! Your mother should have taught you better! "Takeo took her left hand and put it to his lips. The diamond ring he had given her before was shining on her finger. They kept silent for a while. A yacht emerged from Enoshima. and sailed away." Stop it! No more! I don't want to hear any stories with diamonds! You're interfering. The best part is coming. Stop! I'll be punished tomorrow and the day after tomorrow too! Toki! They'll deduct money from my pay! I'll go into debt! Toki. I'll disappoint my parents! I'm sorry! I'm punished everyday too! Cheer up! Otoki! I'll kill the foreman and myself too. Don't be stupid! Who's stupid? You think I'm stupid? I know you're trying to seduce him! What did you say?! He's kind to you, isn't he? How dare you insult me! Stop it! Enough already! Stop it! Toki, stop it! You don't understand! I was born all thumbs. You'll never understand how I feel! Toki. I'm about to pee in my pants. That's about all my advice. Kiku, I hear you appear around the office often. And that cashier becomes nervous when you're there. Shinkichi is an honest man. Honestly, your threads aren't any good. But I cover you. Don't forget that. If you want help, come to me. You have nice fingers. You can be a 100-yen worker. Stop! I feel so much better. Stop it! Let go of me! Let me go! Kiku! Damn that peeing girl! Don't you all think the punishments are too cruel? Toki's thread isn't good enough for export, but they're sold for domestic use. The master didn't lose the entire amount on his cocoons. - That's right. - Right. I don't like a system that makes us compete with one another. The prizes for good workers come from those that don't do well. So the master's wallet doesn't lose a single yen. I feel guilty when you put it that way. Is there any way to help her? My sister worked at a silk mill in Kofu. The master tried to cut their wages. It became a huge deal. The girls all got together and went to see the master. But they were immediately sent away. Naturally. But they discussed it again. When the siren sounded the next day, they didn't work. If a factory doesn't run for a day it's a huge loss for the master. Finally, he gave up their wage cut. Are you still awake? She'll tell Iwa on you. Let's hurry up and go to bed! Don't worry. It's a fact. It happened in June, 1886. Should we go ask the master? We should all go. It's not Mine's fault. Right? That's right. I'll go. - Me too! - Same here! - Me too! Umm... Can poor performing workers like me go too? The more, the better. I'll go too. I understand how Toki feels. I'll go as well! But... she's your friend. Your group will go first. Yes! We'll root for you! Yuki. Asleep? You could answer me. I won't go. Why not? I never liked you from the beginning. Same here. What's up with you? You're one of the young ones, yet you act as if you're superior all the time. - Yuki, stop acting like you're better than us. - That's right. We eat from the same rice pot and sleep together in the same room. We're friends. We can't ignore how terribly Toki is suffering right now. I came here to make money. Performing well and becoming a 100-yen worker is all I care about. Either way, you can't promise it would work. We won't know until we try. Yuki. Toki is... I don't want to be told what to do. What can you do on your own? I've been alone since I was born. Girls of Adano hunt for wild boar. I guess they're like wild beasts that don't understand empathy or compassion. What are you talking about so late at night?! If you dare do anything without my permission, you'll get what's coming to you! It stinks! Pig! There are days in Suwa when crows don't caw, but... Not a day passes without news of girls trying to escape. If you run away, you'll be caught by the police. There's no way you can cross Nomugi Pass. But I want to go home. So do I. But... Silk spinning is the only job for Hida girls. We must work and work. There's no other way. Go to bed. Attention! Listen! Prince Fushimi, President of Japan's Sericulture Society, is going to visit our mill with his spouse. Stand at ease! This is an honor I can only have once in my lifetime. Make sure to behave yourselves. Be on your best behavior. What are you doing? There's garbage over there. Yes! A silk mill is like prison... "Poor workers will be confined to the warehouse. If the prince saw how you worked, it'd be our shame. It'd be disrespectful to His Highness." "The smell of pupas is an insult to him." "I'll turn you over to the police!" "We're in great debt..." These girls are the skilled ones that spin silk for export. Good work. Please work even harder for your country. Pull yourself together. Umm... is he sick? It's nothing. I couldn't look up! She smelled so nice when she passed! That's what people call perfume. "Good work. Please work even harder for your country." Red-and-white sweet cakes! We haven't had them since we won the war against Russia. - Ma'am! - Give us some! Wait your turn. Don't make a fuss. Here you go. Are you allowed to go out today? Nope, they say we can't. Where's Toki? She's around here somewhere. She was crying, reading a letter. Mine, don't you want the sweet cake? You're a good hairdresser. I actually wanted to go to Tokyo and become one. But you came to a mill to spin silk. Fate is so temperamental. Thank you. Yuki, have you seen Toki? She was here a while ago but she left. She asked if she could borrow some money. Even asked this new girl here. My father bought some rice fields, so I had to borrow money too. She asked you? She's been penalized incessantly, and I feel sorry for her... But why don't you ask the "skilled worker" over there? Yuki. I refuse. I know you have savings. You as well. Don't pretend to be all nice and then have the rest of us put up the money. That's not my intention. I'm just like you. I'll ask the young master for a loan! It's a great opportunity to talk to him. You must be happy. He has a crush on you. It's a chance. Don't be silly! Why can't you think about Toki?! The fish are tied together. Not so loud. It's a secret. The prince and his spouse visited us today. They saw how we spin silk. I was so impressed I couldn't see them. Don't be a fool. They're human beings like us. But they're so elegant. They couldn't stand the smell of pupas. Really? Thank you. Mine. Am I bothering you? No. She asked me to write a letter for her. Join us. Thank you. Have you seen Toki? She's confined, isn't she? A body! Put it back! It looks big. A spinner. Poor girl. Toki! Toki! Why? Why did you die? You should have told me! Toki! Toki! This way! Out of the way! Dying on a day like this! What a nuisance! Move back. You caught her in your net?! Fool! Where? Toki! Is she your friend? Whose mill? Stand up! She's a persistent girl. If any of you have anything to do with this, you'll be arrested. All of you come with me to the police station! Hurry up and carry it away! Come. Get up. Come on. Stop making things difficult! Let go! It's over! All of you worked hard. You all did well this year. Work hard for me again next year. Does everyone have a drink? Let's have a toast. Thank you. I feel badly for Toki. This isn't much, but it's to show my condolences. Could you deliver it to her parents? Thank you. I'll deliver it to them. I'll be back next year. Mine. What do you think about me? You're very kind and caring. Is that all? Will you marry me? Oh, no! Don't joke around! Stop! Stop! Someone! Someone! Stop! Take it. Keep it a secret. This side is for those going to Hida. This side is for Kofu. This way! The delivery men are here! Yes! Make sure you have everything! When you're ready, line up! Yes! It's so exciting! Yuki, you're really not going home? There's nobody waiting for me. Your father? He died in October. Unlike you, no one will be glad, even if I become a 100-yen worker. I'll leave the beans. Take care of yourself till spring. Mine. I'll live the way I like. Lake Suwa is a mirror to Mt. Fuji The snow-capped mountain looks as if it has make-up on I want to go beyond the mountains There, my sisters and parents are waiting After the New Year's celebrations, Master Haruo must get married. Stop calling your son master. He can choose Mine or Yuki. He wouldn't like a wife who smells of pupas. Don't forget that our lives depend on those girls. Master Haruo doesn't think so. I said to stop calling him Master Haruo! My grandfather's blood runs through him. I guess after 30 years I'm still the adopted son-in-law. Who's talking about you?! I'm talking about Master Haruo's bride. Baba! Yes? Is supper ready? Yes, ma'am. Yuki. I won't be Mine's substitute. My mother was a silk spinner too. The smell of pupas was that of my mother. I love you. My father was the owner of a silk mill. That's why I don't ever want to have an illegitimate child. You're bright and smart. We can run our mill together. I promise. I'll never leave you. Mine. You're always kind to my daughter. Thank you. Never mind. I haven't done anything. Thank you. I'm glad you're with your father. Dad! You've grown. You're a big girl now. Mother. Your hands are cold. I missed you, Mother! Warm? It's used, but the landowner's wife gave it to me. It's great! Brother! It's you! You came to see me? Of course! You're my sister! Hey, Mine's brother. She became a 100-yen worker. She deserves a feast. You? A 100-yen worker? Really? - Sake for me. - Yes, yes. You look well. Otomatsu. Here's some hot soup. See? Come on over here! Come here, quickly. Otomatsu, drink it while it's warm. Have it while it's warm. Your period? Not so loud. That must have been hard for you. You could have asked one of the men to carry you on his back. How can I mention it to anyone? Eat. Good. I made the rice cake this morning. It's been a year since I had something so good. I wish he could eat it. Who's "he?" Hida is a nice place. Come to Yassan before dark. All right, old man? Take good care of them. Never mind. I can walk. I carried you on my back last year and the year before that. Not this year! You don't have to act so cool just because you're of marrying age. You're mean. Come on. Get on. My back is more comfortable than a train. Come on, hurry. It's warm. Really? Your back is warmer than a stove. I bet. TAKAYAMA, HIDA FURUKAWA, HIDA It was customary for those who brought back the girls from the silk factories to spend the New Year's holiday at the Yassan Inn. They wanted to prevent their skilled girls from being recruited by other mills, while also enticing skilled girls from other factories to come work for them. This silent war between the different silk mills was waged in Hida every year. Dad! Here you go. Goodbye, everyone. We'll be leaving now. All right, we're leaving now. Excuse me, sir. Can you please go on home without Mine? But... There's nothing to be worried about. I just want to get her some new clothes and surprise everyone. It's Mine. I guess the rumor that she's a 100-yen worker is true. She's great. 10 yen in all? Idiot, it's 100 yen. Mine. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks to you, we can have a happy New Year. It was so hard I thought about throwing myself in Lake Suwa. But, Father... Mother... I'm so happy now. It's too much. Seconds, please! All right. An. Whoa, you drink quite a bit now. That's true. Mother, drink some too. Thank you. How long will you be staying? Till the third. You look like a lady with those nice clothes on. You know, I'm a grown woman now. Yamayasu bought me the kimono. I'm jealous. You're working for the country. My life is worth 1 1/2 sen. You're a respectable 100-yen worker. Right, Brother? It's just their way of making sure you don't get recruited to other mills. An, we need to be grateful. I can hold my head up high in town. Mine. Be careful not to let the silk mill consume you. Nonsense! Mine is our family's treasure. Quite a valuable family treasure. Mother, I want to go to a silk mill. Me too. Really!? You want to be like her? You're good girls. You boys complain, but you can't earn 100 yen a year. I'll sing. All right! No matter how hard the work may be I can endure it when I think of my parents An, I brought your lunch. Thanks. Mind your hands. They'll get rough. You should get some rest. Staying at home doing nothing doesn't suit me. You've been a hard worker ever since you were a girl... Babysitting and helping with the farm. It wasn't only me. Every child grows up that way. The woods belong to the landowner, so I earn little. After we pay what we owe him, there isn't enough to buy rice. It's not your fault. All farmers in Hida are like that. Mine. Can this be the final time you go work at the mill? Please. Our sisters are still young. This will be the last time, no matter what Father says. Don't worry. I like the job. I'll work harder and earn more so you can buy land and grow our farm little by little. Mine. It must be really hard working there... Like Toki... Hey, Mine! Hey, Mine! What is it? There's a meeting tonight! Will you come?! We'll be waiting! You fools! She hasn't wed yet! I would never feed her to a pack of wolves such as yourselves! An! It's true! I'm surprised. Wherever I go, people are talking about Mine. I'm glad I bought her the kimono. It's all thanks to you. Please have some. The period of her employment is over. It costs a lot to train a skilled worker like Mine. You will need to sign a new contract. Oh, if it isn't the recruiter for Marusho! Is this Mr. Yamayasu's territory? We're all working hard, aren't we? Sorry. I didn't know. Excuse me. Excuse me. Why don't you rest for a bit? Damn it. He's as sly as a fox. Does he show up often? Not very often. Anyway, I'll keep this contract. I have to discuss this at length with my daughter. Listen. I think you know already, but, don't even think about signing a contract with another mill, regardless of how much they may give you. Good evening. I'm from the rice dealer. I'm from the sake dealer. I'm here to collect the payment. Oil dealer. Mine! - Happy New Year! - Happy New Year! Been a long time. It's only been six days. Not long at all. Is that so? Hello. The first shopping of the New Year? I'll treat you to dinner. I like sukiyaki. Good. And you, Mine? You don't have to be scared. Mine! Good morning! - Happy New Year! - Marusho. I can see you're working hard already. They were begging me to treat them. What do you feed your girls at Yamayasu? I can't believe it. He insisted on treating us to dinner. You're always hungry! Marusho is a louse. He can't take my girls away. Come on, go inside. I'll treat you today. Eat anything you like. Go on in. What's wrong with a father buying sake with the money his daughter earned? It's only morning and you're drunk already. Money won't last forever! She'll earn for me again. Don't complain! Honey. Another recruiter came. He said he was from the Yamahachi Mill. Right? You sent him away. They offered me 50 yen in advance for my signature. I can get money anywhere with my signature. If you loved her, you wouldn't let her work forever. This will be the last time. Shut up! I'm the father of a 100-yen worker! Don't tell me what to do! Please stop it. Get off of me! I'm the father of a skilled spinner who earns a lot. Mother. He's changed. He used to be a hard worker. What?! Spinning is the only job for Hida girls! The book is right. I checked multiple times. The numbers are correct. Shinkichi. 120 yen from the safe is missing. As an accountant, it's your responsibility to know. The money was definitely there yesterday. What did you use it for? A woman? Gambling? Tell me the truth. Do you think I stole it? Cut the crap. Only you and I can open the safe. Speak up! No! I didn't steal it! Examine the books! I don't care about the books! I really don't know! Please wait! Believe me! You're hiding the money in this pouch. Those are the beans Kiku gave me! Beans? Despite everything, he refused to believe me. There's no way I could steal the company's money. I understand! I wouldn't love a thief. He needs the money to buy cocoons right now. He got really upset. He says he'll turn me over to the police if I don't return it. Shinkichi! If he reports me to the police, I'll be sent to prison. No! We're going to get married! I want to! But 120 yen... It takes two years to save that much. I have a mother and sister to support too. What should I do, Kiku?! I'll make the money for you, Shinkichi. But how? I'll die if I can't marry you. Die? Hey, keep your hands busy! The foreman's coming, Kiku. What are you doing?! I'm sorry. The machine doesn't work well. Liar! You weren't working at all. Sorry. Are you worried about something? I've brought hot water for you to wash with! Good, sub-foreman! We're counting on you! A man should be brave! I love you, Otomatsu! You're kind to us. Thank you. I'm a sub. I have no clout. Don't become a mean foreman. I feel like you're all my friends. It was five years ago when you saved me at Nomugi Pass. Come here! Mother sent me some beans. I'll bring you some later. No thanks. I want to share them. "I want to eat them with you." I'll pay back every month. Will you ask the master to forgive Shinkichi?! But you get paid only at the end of the year. Please! At this rate, he'll be sent to prison! Please help him! The master trusts you! Please help him! I beg you! The master will listen to me. Please help Shinkichi! Ask the master to not send him to prison. Please! Please! I beg of you! I'll buy you a kimono. Keep your mouth shut. You're smart. Did you tell your parents about us? I'll never leave you. Don't worry. Did you try to seduce Otomatsu? No. I ate the beans. You like food better than love! Yuki will marry the young master. In the fall. Really?! When the master comes home, I ask... How is business? - The prices of threads today? - You look happy! Things with the young master are going well, huh? Mine. I won. Are you disappointed? No. Don't leave the young master! I'll find a nice man too. Oh, no! Fire! You fool! Everyone! Fire! What happened? Run with me! Kiku. You did it? Mill No.3. Seven injured. Not serious. And... And what? One missing. Who's missing? Kiku Shoji. - Okamatsu! - Yes! Something's on the waterwheel! Check it! What is it? What's on it? I'll sing a Takayama folk song! Don't be too eager to sing! Otomatsu, keep tempo with her! You look masculine! Stay sharp! Everybody, drink up! This one time, everything is on me! If you get drunk, I'll nurse you! The young master and his fiancée! A nice couple! Shinshu No.1! Dance. Dance, everybody. It's a festival! The river is beautiful at night. Yes. Look. It's full of stars. Yes. Hungry? I'm not hungry! I wanted to eat with you. I'll be going. Hana! Wait! Let go! Hana! The Hida beat! Let's go! I'm embarrassed. That's right! I love you, Otomatsu. Really? Otomatsu! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! We are happy to say you are now engaged to Miss Yashiro. Congratulations. Thank you very much for your assistance. Send my best regards. With pleasure, sir. Take this money and have an abortion. It's hard, but... My son thinks it's the best solution. You're an important spinner. Come back after you've had an abortion. Iwa will take you to the doctor. Don't worry. You have no family back home. Be obedient to your master. Work here as before. Will you agree? Please, ma'am. Let me have the baby. We have our reputation to uphold! Absolutely not! Yuki. Don't be stubborn. We must prepare for a new age. Silk mills must be financially supported by banks. If you love me, cooperate with me for the company. Try to understand. We'll hear a baby crying, see diapers hanging out... Maybe it's a boy, who looks like you... I'll buy you a cafe in Suwa. How about it? The banker's daughter isn't charming. I don't want to leave you. Go to the doctor, will you? I guess that settles everything. Whether you decide to have the baby or not, it's no longer my concern. Don't say I'm responsible. Wait! I have something to tell you. Kiku... it's you who killed Kiku and Shinkichi. It was you who stole the money from the safe. If you say that again, you're dead! Stop it! You did an awful thing, young master! You killed Kiku! You hurt Yuki! What did they do to you?! Mine! If you reveal the truth, then you'll be kicked out as well. Mine. Thank you. Are you really leaving? I lost. You won. There's no winning or losing. Is there anything I can do for you? Don't pity me. No. It's a problem for us all. I'll have the baby in Adano. Like my mother had me. But... I'm not like her. I'll come back here with my baby and work at a mill. I'll spin silk better than you. And I'll raise the baby. Yuki. I admire you. You're a strong woman. Have a nice baby. It's my baby. I won't let the mill beat me like Toki or Kiku. Oh my goodness! Pretty! So pretty. I'm so jealous. I don't think I can eat this cake. I actually want to throw it at the young master. But a cake is a cake. Shall we eat? I won't eat it. But Mine... We mustn't. We shouldn't. I won't eat it. Me neither. Me neither! I won't die. I won't die! Here you go. It's hot. It's hot. It was a boy. I buried him near the bamboo shrub out there. No... Every year, girls get pregnant and are sent home. They have fatherless babies. Bastard Pass is another name for this place. RAW SILK MARKET COLLAPSES! GREAT DEPRESSION IN AMERICA! YOKOHAMA SILK MARKET IN A STATE OF PANIC! America!

ONE AFTER THE OTHER, SILK MILLS CLOSE! Let's go! Move your hands! SILK MARKET IN CRISIS! MILLS CLOSED IN SUWA! Young master. It was the same time twenty minutes ago. Twenty minutes late at night, twenty early in the morning. You should know. It's a crisis, use your brain! Do you know about the clock? What is it? They adjust the clock 20 minutes earlier in the morning and 20 minutes later at night. Really? They're stealing time! I'm so tired. My body won't survive at this rate. We shouldn't be silent. The mill owners consulted. Otomatsu told me. It's true. Don't chatter when you work! Mine! The thread is cut! I'm sorry. Don't be lazy! Kuroki! Otomatsu! Do you let them sleep as they work?! I'm sorry. You're supposed to be an expert! I'll wake you up! Damn you! I'll teach you a lesson! What are you waiting for? Work! Otomatsu! Keep your eyes on them so they work! What are you doing?! Come on! What are you doing? The young master is a monster. It's true. Are you all right? It's nothing. My body aches. Mine. Are you all right? She has a fever! I'll bring some water! I'll ask for medicine! Okay, go. Don't worry. Everybody's tired. Hurry up! Make haste! Hurry! Come on! Keep your hands busy! Hurry up! Hurry! Come on! Hurry up! Faster! Make haste! Hurry up! Come on, hurry! Mine is...! Mine is ill. Take her home. KEEP OUT Get well soon. Thank you, everyone. Mine worked hard. My compliments. Accept it. I came to see my sister. Now let me see her. Good morning. Take him to Mine. Accountant, note the expense of ten yen. What about her pay? She hasn't worked since spring. We paid a lot for the doctor and her medicine. She cost us a lot. Still, we must give her some. No. We can't give her anything. KEEP OUT An... Mine... You... I'm glad to see you. Don't worry. I'm here. How's Father? Fine. Mother's fine too. I want to go home. I want to go to Hida. Let's go home. Come with me. What'll we do? Hana. Hana! Going to the toilet again? Let us see Mine off. Let us say goodbye to her! Please! What are you saying? Go back to work! Don't leave your post while you're working! Hana! I won't let you do as you please during work! Hana! Young master! Let us see Mine off! We didn't nurse her. At least let us see her off! Listen up! Forget about Mine Masai from now on! You're human silk machines! If you can't work, you'll be junked! That's a machine's fate! Thank you, sir. Come back when you get well. Take care of yourself. Enough? We'll stay here. I'm sorry it's a place like this. I don't need an inn. I want to go home quickly. Of course. Let's. Mine. Get some sleep. I'll watch the fire all night. Every time you crossed Nomugi, the statue was in snow. Drink. Here. An. Yes? Thank you. What are you talking about? It's been a long time since you crossed the pass on my back. Mine, pull yourself together. Father and Mother are waiting. Yes. During the fall Nomugi Pass has a pretty nice view. Look. I can see Hida. I can see Hida! An... An... I'm back in Hida! I'm back home! You're almost home. They're waiting for you. Mine. Mine! Mine! Mine... Don't die. When was it? I told you... Your second life would be a long one. I congratulated you. You were a shinko then. You were lovable and pretty. Your hair style suited you. Why did you die? Before you reached the age of twenty, before you got married? You've made me into a liar. You could have lived to be eighty or ninety. Look at her. It's as if she's smiling at me. Right? She's a lovely girl even when she's dead. Mine! Mine! Mine's dead! She died at Nomugi Pass! Mine's dead. What's the matter? - Are you crazy? - Let us go! Make them go back to work! - Everyone, get back to you posts! - Let us go! Stop it! Stop it! Mine. I'm sorry. In the last silk tests, Hana and I passed the examination. Me too! Hey! What are you doing? You! Otomatsu! Quickly. Sada, you too? Sada! MEIJI 43 (1910) MEIJI 43 (1910) The year after Mine died, The year after Mine died, the economy in America improved, and the silk market in New York was resuscitated. The Yokohama market recovered from the depression. And Japan was about to be recognized as the world's greatest exporter of raw silk.
