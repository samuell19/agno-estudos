You are John Stockman of 57 Cranbrook Gardens? I am indeed Am I going to understand that you deny the whole story? Of course I do,the whole story as you call it is utterly absurd Well,then in that case Am I going to have the hide of someone for this? I am not entirely without influence in this town -I was speaking,Mr Stockman -I dear say,if you don't mind,Sir I shall like to say something in my own defence You have been doing nothing else and to very little effect,now then.. This whole case is a scandalous intrigue against me Will you be quiet,Sir No,I'm hanged if I will I am very well known in this town And if this business gets out I shall be a laughing stock A laughing stock for the rest of my life If you persist in this attitude I shall be forced to hold you in contempt Now,Sir,to continue, without interruption I hope -Well? -You have heard the case against you You have heard the inspector swear that your's is the name and address he took on the bus I don't care what the inspector says And you have heard the conductor identify you as the passenger in question They were both bribed Please confine yourself to a simple answer yes or no Very well,yes,yes,yes Once is sufficient,thank you Now one moment You failed to shake either of them in the cross examination You have forever chosen to conduct your own defence But upon being invited to present it You have thought fit to launch an attack upon the integrity on the witnesses and that of the court In both cases,unsupported by evidence of any kind If you think I am going into the trouble and expense of telling my lawyers to brief counsel for a petty fogging tin pot little case like this It would be improper for me to comment upon your decision to present your own case But there are numbers of accused people awaiting their trial in this court And I do not propose to keep them waiting any longer than is necessary John Stockman,have you anything you wish to say in your defence? -Yes -And what is it? What I've been telling you I meant by my question,what evidence have you to present? Evidence? The evidence of common sense I should think I've been brought here to listen to a drivelling nonsense of a couple of morons I have been very patient with you But I cannot waste the time of the court listening to a repetition of your abuse of witnesses Now,have you any explanation as to how the alleged events came to take place? Of course not In that case,John Stockman,I have no alternative but fine you 5 Â£ with costs Good afternoon,Madam Good afternoon Mr Cousins Oh,Mr Stockman is here,good afternoon,Sir Pound notes Of course,Mr Stockman,do you wish to see your account? You know perfectly well I wish to see my account I've been here for every month for the past five years cashed the cheque and asked to see my account What makes you think I don't want to see it today? Yes,Mr Stockman Sir,point,Sir John after Stockman 57 Cranbrook Gardens Here we are,Sir -Thank you -Your account,Sir About time Thank you,Sir Here,take a look at that the big shot Oh my Goodness Forgive me I didn't mean it I got to see the manager Clarke It's you,Sir? Well,is everything all right, you wanted to see me Oh it's a It's a It's a These old pound notes ,Sir,should I put them into service? Why not? They are perfectly serviceable Yes,Sir Oh dear Hi Jill What do you think about my story? Well,if it's only matters what I think about it Hunch, that's what it is, that and experience Never underrate experience Believe me I don't If you ask me why I was in that court I couldn't tell you Just like the old days when I was in police court junior, just picking stories out of the air Tom,the editor wants to see you Yeah,I know he must give me the extra money for being a clever boy I'm not so sure he had a tired and firing face on watch your step Nonsense,your devotion to my career makes you too anxious -This is of course -Go and find out what he wants All in good time And be careful It'll be a touching interview East reporter receives Fleet Street's accolade A great job and a great writer,says editor Nolan Tom Quinn modest,magician of the typewriter declines credit Will you go in there? I owe it all to my mother and my boss's secretary handsome fresh face,Tom Quinn today is Tom,something gone wrong,will you go and find out what it is Come in You wanted to see me Mr Nolan Yes Sit down don't interrupt Stockman is not guilty He is,Sir,I was there I told you not to interrupt We had his line up in our legal department for an hour Oh,he's trying to wriggle his way out of it,is he? He doesn't has to wriggle Quinn,I am letting you have this straight So you better not interrupt again Stockman was found guilty because he was too angry and too pigheaded to brief a lawyer Or to bother about establishing his own alibi Well,he has now I see They ordered a retrial But our own lawyers tell us there is no question about it,the man is not guilty Well,I'd better apologize,hasn't I? In print Too late,Quinn I had the proprietor on to me Lord Fenchurch Is it got to him? It went to him first You know the circulation was,and the old man needs money to build it up -Of course -Well Stockman is the money -Oh no,you don't mean to tell me -Of course I do I can't keep you,Quinn You must see that yourself That's monstrous Fenchurch doesn't like it any more than I do But the fact remains that you covered a red hot case in police court and didn't do a follow up on it Of course I didn't I had to make a first edition this morning And what I wrote was true You should have checked You didn't get the personal story If you had waited you'd have the full facts And missed the first edition All right I was wrong But now we got a better story Mistaken identity Could it have happened before?

What? Oh,it's the buses They are so crowded you know More crowded? No,no I shouldn't say more crowded That is,you see,if I'd come by the underground If you come by the underground you'll have to change,twice Well,yes,that's why I shall be later Then why not come by bus? Well,because the buses are so crowded What's the matter with you? Has anything happened? No,no,nothing has happened Can I have my tea,please? Come in Come in and sit down,Freddie Now you've not done anything like this before? No Good than you won't be suspected And I want you to understand,Mr Becket, that I don't want to do anything now Then you let it go What? If you don't want to use the information you've obtained -and go away and we won't use it -It's blight,I want my cut -When we met -No favours,no cuts for anyone And when we met you were digging up a pretty nasty story to hawk around,if I may say so I said that I was always willing to listen to anything you might have to say -So I am -That's swell And I also told you we'd split fifty fifty on anything we got So we will -Well,then? -Well,then If we were to share the profits, we'll share the work And you will stick with me until it's through Well Well All right That's settled You did well,Freddie,for hot tip Yes,but I'm not going to blackmail old Fenchurch I wouldn't dream of letting you do that I also wouldn't dream of letting you blackmail me We are in this together,profitable I hope Yes,as long it is safe Richard Wilford first baron of Fenchurch, clubs,drinking habits,routine,love nests? You see I had my eye on him But thanks to you,Freddie,we can remove the question mark It's a pity we don't know the young woman's name But we needn't worry about that Bluff ought to work now What are you going to do? Phone old Fenchurch Where would he be about now? -At his office -Right,I'll phone him there We are not going to use this telephone they'll trace it This isn't the first time I've done this sort of thing,you know We'll use the phone box, a very public phone box Now is full daylight Less suspicious -What will I do? -You,my dear Freddie Will remain outside You will be waiting impatiently to use the phone after me if anything suspicious happen you open the box and complain that I kept you too long -Right? -Yes,all right No,doctor,I'm expecting him any minute Oh,hold on he's just come in Good morning,Jill,anything for me Good morning,Sir,Dr Meredith,he wants to talk to you about Lady Fenchurch Oh,yes,thank you Good morning,doctor,what's the results? I see just as we expected Nothing more can be done I suppose No Well,thank you very much,doctor,good bye Is there any hope? No,doctors can't make much difference now one way or the other All we can do is just give her comfort Poor darling being a sick woman for years It's only a matter of time now -Any messages? -There's your mail And Tom Quinn phoned but he didn't leave any message Oh,yes Tom Quinn Pity I had to give him the sack A straight journalist True,he made a mistake but it was a mistake that anybody could make He didn't really deserve the sack though Oh,I'll give him another job just as soon as the fuss dies down Old Stockman was after his blood Oh,I see The minute the paper is safe, I'll run it my way Stockman can take it or leave it but in the mean time One martyr must go to the stake Well,I hardly think Tom Quinn is fitted for martyrdom Get him on the phone and I have a word with him Yes,Sir Yes I am sorry to bother you Lord Fenchurch for there is a little matter I like to get straight Who is that speaking? Well,that's the difficulty I know you, of course,but I'm sure you don't know me I like to say there is trouble,if I may You are keeping a young lady in a little flat I won't embarrass you with mentioning her name and address I don't want to embarrass you at all But there are those who might make very bad use of the information I think I can keep them quiet but not for nothing If you know what I mean I can think I can save you a bit of trouble Come to your friends to make what they like of any information they have true or false And since you have no further need to worry on my account don't try and telephone me again Ah but the information won't be given to your business associate to begin with It will start with your nearest and dearest so to speak And work outwards Now you listen to me you can whistle for your money and you can tell my associate anything you like But my wife is a very sick woman and if she's troubled I'll call the police I won't have it,you understand You see Lord Fenchurch, that's what I am afraid of If I ring your home,your wife may answer -Yes,yes I see what you mean -I thought you would -But don't worry I can help you -How? You will leave an envelope containing 2000 Â£ at Islington Post Office tomorrow morning If it is not there 2000 Â£ won't be enough You will address it Poste Restante James Riddle after that you can set your mind at rest For the time being You got that clear? Yes,2000Â£ Good bye Lord Fenchurch -Were you listening? -Yes I'm sorry I was trying to get Tom Quinn for you I couldn't help overhearing -I see -What are you going to do? Pay I suppose Another sacrifice for the paper? No No,it's my wife She mustn't know about this I just got to pay I've almost forgotten the other girl existed these last few weeks But she does exist Yes,she does I wonder how a blackmailer would find out about these things Only one person could have told him apart from you -You mean Simone? -Is that her name? Yes,Simone Day Now but she wouldn't have told anyone How can you be sure? Well,because even if she is not as fond of me as she As she pretends? As she suggests it wouldn't worth her while to blackmail a man who has been so generous to her That make sense So we are dealing with a man who has gotten his information from an outside source In that case someone must talk to Miss Day You mustn't now so,can I help? Thank Jill but there is no reason you should have to It's not a question of having to I wouldn't like to see Lady Fenchurch hurt any more than you would So we must keep Miss Day on our side Thank you very much,Jill Where does she live? Lawrence Street a place called Cumberland Mansions Flat 4 Oh I thought you got the milk Are you Miss Day? -Yes -I want to talk to you,may I come in,please? Won't another time do? No I'm afraid not What is it about? It concerns a friend of yours All right then,come in I wish I could help but I am afraid I don't understand I am not a friend of Lord Fenchurch I am sure that he is ever such a nice gentleman Are you quite certain,Miss Day? Gentlemen call us ,of course,same as you I'm sure,I don't often remember their names No,I remember a Lord if I met one I think perhaps you remember Lord Fenchurch,Miss Day It's important,you see because any understanding between you can not continue now that he has been blackmailed I can't understand how people can be so wicked They think of nothing else but money Lord Fenchurch is paying 2000 Â£ at this moment to someone he doesn't know or probably never will -2000? -Yes,2000 Â£ that he can ill afford So you see if you have been receiving anything from him it can't continue unless of course Unless what? Unless he can pay the blackmail And how could we do that? We can't unless you agree to three very simple conditions We can't be certain even then On the other hand we can be quite certain if you don't agree you must look for other means of support What were you wanting me to do supposing I was interested Firstly in return for a very large down payment you must agree not to never see Lord Fenchurch again Secondly you must agree to deny your association with him or at least it is still continuing And thirdly you must agree to leave this flat for another one far removed from this district Well,supposing I don't You won't refuse,Miss Day,but if you do the blackmailer will continue The rent form this flat,which I am sure is in your name,will not be paid for you And you may be very well be dragged to the Law Court I don't think I.. I'm sorry I have to put it this way but I have no alternatives Nor I am afraid you Now,do you remember Lord Fenchurch? Well,coming to think of it I do sort of recall a gentleman like what you describe Good Then I can rely on you? A lady likes to help a gentleman,doesn't she? And you're going to? Yes,will you tell me if they try the gentleman again though of course I hope they don't Why do you want to know? Why? I think there might be another way to stop them, I have friends All right Good morning all -One of your friends? -Yes,this is Jimmy boy,my cousin -Howdy -Good morning I found this outside so I thought of bring it in Thank you,how kind of you Oh,you know me I all for return to anyone Jimmy has the key so that You can drop the milk at any time he is passing,what a good idea Yes Well,I must be going,remember what I said,Miss Day Yes,of course Don't bother I can see myself out They are blackmailing Fenchurch and if you don't think fast Jimmy boy we are going to lose our meal tickets Pipe down OK,let's have it They have done in the old man -What?Blackmail?Fenchurch? -Yes But he is ours So you've said Meanwhile someone ask him 2000 quids I thought you said if there was always going to dine(?)we would Who's got the finger on him? I don't know,he doesn't know himself But she's going to let me know the next time it happens I see What are you going to do about it? We'll be there the shot on I wonder who they are Who cares But know it is up to you Jimmy boy and you better be ready I am always ready Hello,Tony I've got a job for you I don't know when but keep sober and don't hit anyone until I tell you I'll meet you in the same place Cheap crooks Is that the place? Yes,that's where our good friend Mr Riddle has a private post office box I think somebody will depositing a large envelope for him at any moment Why did we have to get here first? To make sure that nobody else has been sent here before You don't mean the police? I certainly do What happens if he's told them? Then we drive away quietly But I think the great Lord Fenchurch a little too wise for that There he is,that's him Ah,yes We'll give him plenty of time for this Then what do I do? I told you Stand in the corner by the post office While I go inside if anything unusual happens put your hands in your pocket when I come out But don't worry nothing will go wrong How do you know? Because only you and I and the goose laying the golden eggs know anything about this We'll give him a little time to get away Oh,let's get it over with It's plenty of time,you don't have to work to the clock Well,here's the first lot There's your share,Freddie How does it feel,though? But how did he manage to lay his hands on all this overnight? He went to the office first, he's got a safe there hasn't he? Well,there is an easier way of opening the safe than blowing them Oh,what do we now Wait a bit and don't flush that money about too much We are on a good thing and I don't want you spoiling it Do you think he is good for more? A man who's afraid hurting his sick wife is a sitting duck Suppose she gets better? I don't think she will but if she dies it's the end of the game for us How long do you think it'll last? Hard to say but it means we can't wait too long for the next instalment -Hello -Hello Chatty aren't you? You didn't speak me this morning on my way in If you say good morning I should say good morning That's only because you are a very well brought up young girl Oh,shut up Shut up yourself How dare you speak to me like that,kindly leave At once -If you have to -I don't have to I'm going to be your next door neighbour Where? Obituaries From the cradle to the grave by Tom Quinn Have you taken the job? Nolan just offered it to me I knew he was going to but I didn't think you'll take it -Why not? -Oh,I don't know I just thought you'd think you were past that sort of thing Of course I'm passed that sort of thing I'm five years passed that sort of thing -But jobs aren't so easily come by nowadays -You'll get them all right -Not so near you -Calm Don't let anything awful happen again It seems the old man rushed in this morning and told Nolan to offer me the job I don't either of them thought I'd take it I know Lord Fenchurch brushed by me without a word -You must be on his conscience -I am glad something is -I must go,see you soon -When do you start? -Tomorrow -Until tomorrow then Tomorrow Another whisky,please,Elsie Well,I might as well settle up here,while I'm here,won't I? Settle up? -You? -Yes,how much do I owe you? -Could you pay your bill? -Naturally Blimey,laughing the whole can't believe a word(?) Hi,Freddie Excuse me,boys Are you pushing the border? Hello,Tom,have a drink I think so I like a large scotch Here we are,you see Six,forty that's 8 pounds and 15sh 6p Was that all?

You would think that,wouldn't you? Well naturally You can't possibly imagine that I could by this honestly,can you? There are limits I'm afraid even to my imagination Can't tell me the paper paid you all that? It does,in a way You'll be surprised In finding a particular lucrative skeleton in somebody's cupboard What makes you say that? Just an idea You gossip's type trade and that sort of thing,don't you?

It's just hunch -Not another one -Yes,another one A kind of hunch that has never let me down yet I got to follow it,Jill Can't you tell me anything? Yes,I can I think,only think,mind you,that Fenchurch maybe worried about his girlfriend The one I told you about in the pub If I know about it,others may You probably mentioned it to Freddie I certainly didn't but he overheard You should be more careful,Tom Or more sober You mean he was there when I told you?

You can't always know what the master is going to do When are we going start pulling the pressure on again? When I say so I'm getting short of cash You shouldn't have spent the last lot so fast I know,I know I told you,didn't I? Yes,yes,you told me Don't see any halos around your ears It isn't a question of right or wrong,it's plain common sense One day you can't afford the price of a drink The next day you are kicking the whole bar That's inclined to make people think And when people start putting two and two together it's surprising how many of them make five Well,cut out the preaching When are we are going to get our hands on some more money? Any moment now And when is that? -Let's ring him up straight away -Now? I thought you wanted it,isn't it?
