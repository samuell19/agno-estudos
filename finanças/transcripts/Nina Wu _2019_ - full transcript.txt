BIG PRODUCER'S NEW HIT BROKE BOX-OFFICE RECORDS AGAIN Hello, everyone! I'm online now. Welcome, Prince! Hello, 007! It's ten in the evening. Why did you say "good morning"? 007: HAVING DUMPLINGS AGAIN? YOU COULD BE HAVING ME. 007... If you buy me 100 love tokens... Thank you, Hao Bangbang! MARK INCOMING CALL Hello, Mark. Hi, Nina. A producer is inviting you to an audition. Check your email. Really? Okay, I'll check it now. Everyone, I'll be right back. ROMANCE OF SPIES SCENE 1 NIGHT SCENE. HOTEL ROOM, 1960'S SHE LIES IN BED, NAKED, BETWEEN TWO OFFICERS... When did you come to Taipei? Eight years ago. I've been your agent for six years, right? In the past six years, aside from short films and advertisements, you haven't been in a film, have you? Sir, it's past midnight. Can I smoke? -Sure. -Thank you. If you don't want to do it, we can turn it down. If you're uncomfortable with it, let's not even try for it. What matters most is how you feel about it. Can we ask the director how he would shoot the sex scene? The script says full-frontal nudity, but... Of course, we can. But keep one thing in mind. There's stiff competition for this role. So, if you have any concerns, don't even bother auditioning for it. Let's think it through. Is nudity necessary in the story? Or is it just for a sensation? Those Hollywood stars you go on and on about... There are only two reasons for them to accept a role. Either it's a good character to play, or it gives out good pay. In this case, it's a good character. I doubt that any real professionals would turn down a plum role just because of nudity. But I'll respect your decision. It's up to you. Please leave a voice message. Speak after the beep... This is... Hello, Kiki. How are you doing? Listen. A film producer is asking me for an audition. I think I'm likely to get the part. Just when I think that I have no chances left, this opportunity comes along. I really like your acting style. I have already seen all those short films. Some would be really awful without your performance. I believe, a performance in a film should be natural. Say you're taking a shower, do you worry about being naked? And when you're making love, do you worry about showing yourself? Being natural is key. The camera is rolling. Would you like to start? I can't bear it any longer. I really can't take it anymore. They're not only destroying my body... but also my soul. Take me with you... wherever you go. Only when I'm with you... can I be free. I really can't take it anymore. They're not only destroying my body... ...but also my soul. Take me with you... wherever you go. Only when I'm with you... can I be free. "I can't. We can't go anywhere." I love you. "I love you too. But I can't... The world doesn't love us. Do you understand?" Then don't hate me! I'll do something that'll make everyone regret! You're the ones who are forcing me... to seek vengeance. Okay, cut! It's okay. Okay? -Yes. -Good. -That's a wrap. -Thank you all. Let's pack up. Thank you, everyone. -Thank you, everyone. -Well done. Well done! All right. Please reverse the car and stop here. I think it´s not bad. Very good. It´s not bad. Tomorrow I'll probably shoot... from this angle. The next shot will be like that. Are you able to shoot the strobe light? Tomorrow, we will... Mark's heading to Beijing for business. He said not to let him down. If you need any help, just come to me. -I wish Colonel Tsai... -Cut! Cut this one. Let's make a change. Say the line before your movement. I want you to look natural, okay? Let's take another one! Get moving! Replace the dumplings. Slate! Sound speed! Scene 28-1. Take 8! And action! -I wish Colonel Tsai... -Cut! Okay, stop rolling. What's the point of pouring wine? What's the most important thing in this scene? Finding the secret note? That's right. Just talk right away as you chew on it. But when I notice it in the dumpling, I still have food in my mouth. So I don't think it's natural to start talking. I don't care if it's natural or not. This is a movie. I want drama! Your comrades have to know you've got the note. Then the audience will get it too. Got it? The secret note is the hint. That's it. Replace the dumplings! Slate! Scene 28-1. Take 9! I wish Colonel Tsai a great promotion and a successful career. Cut! Good! Next shot. It's done, next! Replace the dumplings, please. Thank you. Thank you. I really can't take it anymore. They're not only destroying my body... but also my soul. Take me with you... wherever you go. Only when I'm with you... can I be free. I can't! We can't go anywhere. I love you. I love you too. But I can't! The world doesn't love us. Do you understand? Then don't hate me! I'll do something that'll make everyone regret! You're the ones who are forcing me to seek vengeance. Don't be silly. -What are you going to do? -Don't come near me! Don't come near me! Cut! What are the three stages of this scene? First, threaten him. Second, grow soft on him and want to kill yourself. Third, get angry and go crazy. You want to kill them all. Say the lines, come on. I really can't take it anymore. They're not only destroying my body but also my soul. Keep going! Take me with you, wherever you go. Again! Play it! Only when I'm with you... can I be free. Speak! I can't! We can't go anywhere. Keep going! I love you. I love you too. But I can't! The world doesn't love us. Do you understand? Then don't hate me! I'll do something that... Say "motherfucker". Swear at me! Repeat my swearwords! Motherfucker. Motherfucker. Swear! -Motherfucker. -"Motherfucker." You fucking cunt. "You fucking cunt." Louder! Motherfucker! You fucking cunt! "Motherfucker! You fucking cunt!" Motherfucker! You fucking cunt! "Motherfucker! You fucking cunt!" You're a cheap whore! You're a crappy, stupid director! Say the lines. Say the lines. Come on. Then don't hate me! I'll do something that'll make everyone regret! You're the ones who are forcing me to seek vengeance! That's it! One more take! Nina... We've got pork and chicken dumplings. Which do you prefer? It's okay. I'm not hungry, thank you. I'll leave them here. Eat when you're hungry. All they give you are dumplings? They're not even hot. Well... We all get the same. You think too much. They're bullying you! No, they're not! She brought me the lunchbox. The others have to fetch it themselves. Could you please focus a bit? What do you mean? Just focus, okay? I'm already focused. I really want to do well, you know? Please... Don't you see the situation here? I don't want any distractions. You think too much. We won't get into any more trouble. Okay? Good morning, Mr. Director. Good morning. You know, we'll come to the most important scene after Lunar New Year. Yes, I know. You'll go through five stages in the scene. Delirious, desperate, heartbroken... suddenly revived... and then letting go and liberated. Make sure you're ready. Yes. I'll be ready. Thank you, Mr. Director. Then, I'll be going. Goodbye. Thank you, Mr. Director. Thank you. Come on. Happy Lunar New Year! -Happy Lunar New Year! -Happy Lunar New Year! Happy Lunar New Year! Let's hope our family celebrity Nina, get even more famous and make a fortune! That doesn't matter. The important thing is to have good health. What do you know? All actors need to get famous! Here's to Nina. May she make a big fortune in the Year of the Dog! Here's to the good fortune for the Wu family! You got it all! You're a lucky dog! My sister, we're all lucky dogs in the Year of the Dog! Let's hope Nina's film will be a big hit. And your factory makes big money! To the Wu family! Let's hope Nina gets to Hollywood and wins an Oscar! -Impossible. -Nothing's impossible! No more nonsense during New Year. Let's make a toast! No more nonsense. We talk like dogs in the Year of the Dog! Here's 4,000 dollars. Thank you. Here are the leftover takeouts. Thank you. You're still using plastic bags like these? A restaurant like yours should have your logo on the bags! I make customized plastic bags. I'll give you a discount. Thank you! Happy New Year! Please leave a voice message. Speak after the beep... This is... Kiki... Happy New Year. PHOTOS Nina, let me explain this scene. This sex scene is crucial in the film. It's to convey the helplessness that one feels in life. So much happiness, sorrow, and love are bundled together. You feel anguish in your heart. You don't want to face it and do this. But your body doesn't lie. It feels the pleasure from it. Everything is ready. Assistant Director. Block the scene and we'll start shooting. Okay. Actors, let's rehearse the poses. One. No emotions involved, and pose for the camera. Two. No emotions involved, and pose for the camera. Three. No emotions involved, and pose for the camera. Four. No emotions involved, and pose for the camera. Five. No emotions involved, and pose for the camera. Stop crying! How could you screw up such a simple scene? Please leave a voice message... This is... Kiki... Did you get my voice messages? I just had a dream. I dreamt... that I was walking... on a scorched mountain. There was nothing there. There was only a tree there. Just one dead tree with no leaves. Then, guess who I met? I met Nicole Kidman. She asked me to play a game with her. She said... "In ten minutes, a flood will pour down the mountainside." She and I had to hold on to the tree to survive. Before she'd finished speaking, the flood was on its way down. The torrents were huge with dozens of stories high. I held on to the tree with all my strength. After ten seconds... I made it through. But Nicole Kidman didn't. She had been washed away by the flood. The flood was so powerful. Why didn't you tell us earlier? Does the director know? I'll tell him. Mr. Director, Nina didn't get her diving certificate. What the hell? I think we need to change the scene. How? I'm thinking of using a stand-in. Finding a stand-in at the last minute? -Anyhow, we shoot the scene tomorrow. -How? Can you change the scene? Change to what? Mr. Director... I'm sorry. It's okay, I know. Don't worry, we're prepared. Just concentrate on your performance. Remember the five stages I told you about? Yes. Delirious, desperate, heartbroken, suddenly revived, and finally letting go and liberated. Good. Keep going until I shout "cut". We'll start when you're ready. Get ready. Grip it tightly. Careful! Here. Okay, she's in position! Let's start shooting. Everyone, get ready! Concentrate. Okay, ready. -Sound. -Speed! -Camera -Rolling! Goodbye! Goodbye! See you in the next life... Assistants... Stop filming! You're breaking the law! Drag them away! -Who's in charge here? -We're shooting a movie! The film is great! A new superstar is born! Nina... Your performance is really brilliant! Nina, you've made it! You gave it your all! Congratulations! Congratulations to you too, Mr. Director. Keep working hard. Thank you, Mr. Director. Good! Beautiful! Wow, you're stunning! Nice! Good. Truly stunning. Can you talk about how you were discovered? I was running a stall in the night market. Mark, my agent, said he wanted to sign me in. So you're from Taipei? I live in Taipei, but my father runs a factory in central Taiwan. You started as an internet celebrity but also worked as extras. Have you always wanted to be an actress? Yes, I've always wanted to be a great actress. I took ballet classes when I was five, practiced martial arts when I was seven. I also took singing lessons when I was eight, and I majored in theatre and acting in college. Wasn't it hard to work as extras? Yes, it was. And the pay was low. How hard could it get? Sometimes I only had one job a month that paid just over 1,000 dollars. -How could you have survived? -I only spent 30 dollars a day. In what films did you act as an extra? Mostly in short films or commercials. Some TV dramas, too. Indie productions and as well as commercial films. Anything we would know? When Luc Besson shot Lucy in Taiwan... Amazing, Luc Besson! -Yes, I was in it. -What character did you play? -I was an extra, but I had one line. -Which character were you playing? When the heroine walks into the hotel, I open the door and say, "Welcome!". We heard that in this new film you are totally naked in explicit sex scenes. I think being naked isn't the point. You did full-frontal nudity? I don't think nudity is the point at all. I'm a professional actor. And you have a threesome in the film? You had no problem with that? -I don't think a threesome is really... -I'm sorry. That's all we have time for. -We're out of time. -One last question. -One last question... -Are you seeing the executive producer? -Thank you for the questions -Are you happy together? -Thank you, everyone. -Are you two in a relationship? -See you next time, thank you! -Don't we get twenty minutes? This is ridiculous. Outrageous! ONLY SPEND 30 YUAN DAILY Excuse me, are you Nina? I followed all of your live streams! I heard that you're in a big movie? Yes. -Congratulations! -Thank you. Can I put the mask on your face now? Sure. We've collaborated with a French company on this product. It's made with honey from Provence and snowmelt from the Alps. All-natural ingredients. You can even eat it. Have a taste! It's sweet, right? Close your eyes and rest. DAD INCOMING CALL Auntie, Uncle... Sufen, you're here at last! Mom, how are you? Sufen, I don't get it. It's just minor surgery. Why did the doctor asks the whole family to be here? They won't even start unless you're here. This heart surgery is not a small one. It's all your dad's fault. Customized plastic bags? I've told him to stop making plastic bags. Nowadays, it's all about being eco-friendly. It's driven him mad. All the orders have been canceled. And there are loans that need to pay off. Now is not the right time, my sister. He has depression. He's a patient, too. No wonder he's depressed. Back in the day, he squandered all of your grandfather's estate away and moved to that rural place. I have... I have nothing left for you. So I haven't made a will... Is everyone in the family here? This is the main reason why she had a sudden heart attack. The sooner we insert the catheter and place the stent, the better Mrs. Wu's chances are. But there are risks. If you agree, we'll operate as soon as possible. Do you agree? Yes, we do. In that case, we'll carry out the surgery as soon as we can. What do you want? Kiki. Long time no see. When I heard your mom was having surgery, I thought I would come to see her. How are you? I'm good. You didn't sleep well last night? No. The Little Prince is on again. We opened last night. The celebrations went on till dawn. As soon as I heard about your mom, I rushed here. You're still playing The Little Prince? Yes. I'm still playing The Little Prince. -Unlike you. You're now in a film! -That's not what I meant. I really miss it. I think it's great. Come and see us. Then we'll have a star's endorsement! Kiki... Are you really seeing the guy who plays The Fox? Sufen... Sufen... I want some water. Oscar! I miss you so much! How much does my dad owe you? Six months' pay. I know there won't be any redundancy pay. How much in total? It's 180,000 dollars! What? You worked in his factory all your life! He paid you only 30,000 dollars a month? Mr. Wang, you'll get the money for sure. See? A star isn't like us! Money means nothing to her. You'll get the money next week. Please don't cause any more trouble. What do you mean trouble? I've worked in that factory my whole life. Never had I took a single plastic bag from you. I know your dad has a mental illness so I never ask for the pay myself. Goodbye. My secret is a simple one. It is only with the heart that one can see right. What is essential is invisible to the eye. What is essential... is invisible to the eye. It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important. It's the truth and you must not forget it. You will be forever responsible for the things that you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose! I'm responsible... for my rose! Goodbye. You messed up our cue! I never thought you would drink honey lemon. -Long live honey lemon. -Let´s drink. Excuse me, can I have your autograph? You're a big star! Did you see the play just now? It's not fair! I want an autograph too! Go away. -Thank you. -Don't scare kids. -Thank you. -Come see us again next time. -Bye! -Bye! What do you mean by that? Here you go. I'm still irresistible to children! You could be in a movie too. Me? But I love my rural life. My agent can help sign you up. No way! Because of him? Are you really seeing him? None of your business, is it? Can we still be together? I don't want to. We can be open about our relationship. Impossible. We are not happening. Let's be together again, please... We could have if you hadn't left. But my life is good now. Things are going well for me. I miss you so much. I've been missing you so much. Sufen. I... A lot of things have changed. Our parents are getting old. You know that better than I do. I promised my mom that she would see her grandchildren. Damn! What century is this? Then go tell your parents that you love women! I dare you not. I'm not like you. I'm just someone teaching English in primary school. Someone with a stable income and is trying to keep her passion. You could still keep your passion in Taipei. You could even act in other plays, not just The Little Prince for kids. What's wrong with The Little Prince? You've always thought The Little Prince is just for kids. But it means everything to me! Without it, my life would be meaningless! Don't you understand? What do you want? What's the matter? Oscar! Oscar! I really can't take it anymore. Dad, what happened to you? Oscar! Hello, Nina It's Mark Mark? The film is selected for a big film festival! It's fantastic news! There'll be a press conference on Monday. Come back to Taipei. You need to be back by Friday. Sufen... What the hell are you doing? It's the money my dad owes you. As for what happened to Oscar I'll tell the police! Hey, what's wrong? Is she possessed? The god sees an evil spirit! -What's wrong? -Come back to us... -Let's go. -Come back to us... Come back to us... It's all right... It's all right. It's all right. -Hello? -Hello, Mark. Nina. I booked you a beauty treatment. Have you put on weight? You'll be on the red carpet. You need to be ready for that. Yeah, I see. This is the latest fat-melting machine. Great for slimming your body. But please do keep still or you'll get burned. And keep quiet too. Though I know, you love barking like a dog! I've told you, it's hot! What do you want? Why did you get the role? You did it. I did it too! I didn't! What do you mean you didn't? Did you forget we had a threesome together? Miss Movie Star. I auditioned for it! Audition? It's because you're better at sex. That's why he chose you. What do you want? You've already snatched away what I wanted. How much do you want? I'll ask my agent to sign you up. You could have a good career... Hey, look... Please come in. Here, this way. All six are here. I'm the executive producer. I think there are two types of films. Money-makers and award-winners. Those are the two kinds of films that I have produced. This is a film about women. The story focuses on a woman. It reveals her suppressed sexual desires. This time, I've decided to cast a new face. I don't mind if you've never been in a film, but you need to be brave. Dare to show full-frontal nudity. Of course, you need to be a good actress as well. Numbers 2 and 5, please step forward. You were a couple passionately in love. You loved each other deeply. Ten years after you broke up, you meet again. As soon as you meet, you two make out passionately. Okay? Start. That's enough. All right. Thank you for your performance. Number 1, please step forward. Can you speak the lines in that scene? Sure. I really can't take it anymore. They're not only destroying my body... but also my soul. -Take me with you... -Okay, that'll do. Yes, thank you, Number 1. You can leave the room now. Can you swim? Yes. Can you burst into tears in ten seconds? Yes. You're okay with having a threesome? Do you have a boyfriend? No. -Have you ever studied acting? -Yes. -You're a dog. -What? You're a dog, don't you get it? Come on. Drink it. Fine, she can go. You're a dog too. These two stays. The rest can go. You can leave now. Whoever tears off the other's clothes first will get the leading role. Okay, cut! Both of you are good. I don't know which to choose. Choose me... Choose me... I'll do anything... -Anything? -Yes. Anything you want. And you? This is a difficult role. She's depressed and schizophrenic... Not easy to play... Hey. The bark of a dying dog is really hard to do... But Oscar taught me how. Oscar's barking was unique. Even the dog is a better actor than you are! It's not my fault that you didn't get the role. We were in the same position. I won it fair and square. It wasn´t fair at all... I'm the professional actor here. You're a nobody. I know perfectly that... That's how this business works. Exchanging one thing for another. I gave them all I had. But I got nothing. Why did you get it? You nasty bitch! I'll show the world what a lousy actor you are! Hello, Sufen. Guess where I am? At your place in Taipei! Kiki. Why are you in Taipei? I wanted to surprise you. Where are you? I... What happened to you? Are you all right? I'm fine. Wait there. I'll be right back. Okay, see you soon. Oscar! You're back! The dumpling filling in the fridge is about to go bad. Give me a hand. I've been busy. I completely forgot about it. Hello. Come on in. Thank you for coming to the audition. Have you eaten yet? Yes, thank you. Please bear with me. I've been having meetings with actors all day. -Okay. -I won't be long. Please speak the lines from the scene. Sure. I really can't take it anymore. They're not only destroying my body... but also my soul. Take me with you... wherever you go. Only when I'm with you... can I be free. Pretend to be an animal. I mean, to mimic an animal that you like. Or a pet you have. Give it a try. Okay. Do you drink? Alcohol can help actors to trigger their emotions. Here.
