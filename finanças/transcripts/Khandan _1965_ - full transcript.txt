Shankar, Parvati, come here. For birth of Krishna,have U made arrangements for the swing? Yes, the swing has been decorated, only a silk cord... ...is awaited. Good, well done. Here! This Dhoti and Shirt is for you. What work I will do in the fields after wearing such... ...fine silk clothes. With me around, only your enemies will work in the fields. Don't you have labourers? Parvati, this set is for you. Brother, does it look all right at my age to wear such clothes. If it doesn't look nice on a princely daughter like you, ...who else will it look nice on? Where is your sister in law? Bhago! What is it? Why are you shouting. Call me Bhagwanti. You won't let me bathe in peace. I have had my bath. Why are you giving me another? Here! Saree for you for Janamashtmi. This is a saree from Nlurshidabad. That one is from Benares! What will you illiterates know! Nlurshidabad is ahead of Benares. If you like this Saree, you may take it. Why should she take? The right of a younger... ...one is first. You keep it. Go. As if I haven't seen a Benares Saree! In my house, Benares ...sarees used to be put on cows during winters! Why not! The place where Bhagwanti was born, must have... ...belonged to some real lucky man. I only remember that when... ...you came to my house, I had 125 acres of land. And now ...only 100 acres is left. Did I swallow the 25 acres. If wealth was so dear to you,... ...you shouldn't have spent so much on treating a lame person. Govind, what has happened? Where are you? In the vat! Come out. Good. Tell me, how did you fall? Today being Krishna's birthday, I thought I will color the horns... ...of Laxmi. But she gave me such a kick, I fell into the vat. See Laxmi, even Tai is laughing. Green fodder is stopped for... ...you from tomorrow. You will get only dry grass! How is Laxmi to be blamed. You know this cow has come from ...her place. If she doesn't kick, what else will she do? Big father, you are absolutely right! You have all become strong by drinking milk of this cow. Look, go and have a bath, and come inside. Brother! God bless you. May God keep us happy 8. together. Not only is he my brother, but my friend and my right hand. I do not have any children, but when I see Shankar,... ...I feel I am somebody's father! I am your baby only! Today is Janamasthmi, what are you feeding us? Yes, but only after 12 midnight, after the birth of Krishna. Come with me! I have brought a silk Dhoti & shirt specially for U Great! Some girl will fall for me today! You are spoiling him. Has he got to take part in sing-song that... ...he has to put on silk clothes! Come on! Be nice and talk nice for a change! He is the one born first of our house, if he does not stay... ...in style who will? Tau, what a fine reply, Tao. What do you say now, Tai? I care too hoots for this Uncle nephew relationship. You would... ...have been better off in a drama group. Look Tai, you love Shamu so much, love me a little also. Go! Don't compare yourself with Shamu! Sister, I gave birth to Govind & Shamu. But they are both yours Enough! For me Sham is adequate. You can keep... ...this lame duck with you. Bhago, now get away from here. Ok, I am going. Why should I waste my time standing here. Govind, if Lord Krishna had known that there are women ... ...like Bhagwanti on this earth, he wouldn't have incarnated here And if after birth, he had seen my Tai, he would surely have... ...forgotten how to play the flute. Control your tongue. Tai is ...like your mother. One shouldn't talk like that about her Brother, you only have been too lenient with him That is why he goes and sits on everybody's head. Yes, keep him in your eyes! He is the light of my house! Go and change your clothes! Ok. I will just come. You are delaying a lot, Nandlal Brijbala is waiting for you. She is also asking everyone, where is the one with the flute! No one wants to go into the forests ... ...to pick flower buds without you All are yearning to hear your flute on the banks of Yamuna Please manifest yourself now, don't keep us anxious any more The earth where you were born is in trouble today. Fulfil your promise ... Fulfill your word, which you had given in the Sacred Gita Beside you there is none else who is the protector of India. Lord Krishna is born! Hail the Lord! Lord, you have already given me so much. What should I ask?. I have this small world, let it prosper allways Tau, this is the first Janamashthmi that Sham has'nt... ...attended. Sham's sweets can be put in a packet and sent to him Should sweets be sent in a envelope? I had got clothes... ...for him. They have been despatched to him by post. Shanker, distribute the sweets! I will distribute! Ok, take it. Mother! Govind! Mother, who is this? Son, this is Radha. She is the only daughter of our old friend, Ganga Ram. Her mother died long time back, and now her father has died. She will now stay with us. Mother, You have done an... ...excellent thing. If everyone like you adopts one orphan each, ...all orphanages of the world will have to be closed down. Is everyone in your house so kind? Looking at me & mother, you made this assumption! Meet my Tai and then I will ask you. Come mother, let us go! Come Radha. In exchange of your boon, I ask for your kingdom, said Kaikeyi If you consider yourself as a warrior, keep your word Ram should not become the king and should... ...become a servant & go into exile for 14 years! These words were not words but poisonous arrows! Raja Dashrath was shaken, and joining his hands pleaded... I will give my entire kingdom to your son, Bharat. But Kaikayi's heart was made of stone. She insisted that by ...ordering Ram into exile please fulfil your word. Is it true in that age, women like Kaikayi existed? Don't talk of that age, today's Kaikayi is at the ...moment standing next to me! Stop this! Stop this Ramayan! Who is Dashrath or Kaikayi?. Valmiki had no work or business. So he started ...penning this story. This is not Valmiki Ramayan. Priest you may leave now! Yes, priest you may go. If you keep listening to her, your faith... ...in Ramayan too may go. Farewell ! Govind, where were you since morning? Tau, I was in the fields. Tau, mother has come. Parvati, who is this? She is the daughter of late Seth Ganga Ram. After her father's... ...death, she has nobody. How can a young woman stay alone... ...so I brought her along with me. She will help in housework You have never done an intelligent thing. Why get such ... ...a girl into your house, who has consumed her own parents. Radha, what did I say. As she opened her mouth, she let off... ...a cracker! Have you heard what nonsense is your favourite nephew uttering. He is saying the right thing. He is simply introducing you. You keep taking his side. Had he been my son, would he have ...spoken against me like this. Sister, he is your son only! Great, what a child. You wish that in my fate too I have a... ...son like him. Instead of giving birth to such a son, it is better.. ...That a girl remains unmarried. If by mistake he gets married,... ...then it is better that the girl hangs herself. I have been hearing of this hanging business since ages. Whole life, I have been laughing, Give me a chance to cry! Enough, if I die, you will cry for the rest of your life. When will that day come, just tell me! Look Bhagwanti, Whatever God does he does it with a lot of... ...thought. When he created a horse, knowing he is short in... ...temper, he hasn't given him horns. You are a dry river.. If Parvati was not there, who would have been there to ...continue the family name. She has produced two sons and she has become a queen in this... ...house. Don't say queen, say Empress! Parvati, I accept this girl. From today she'll stay in this house. God bless you! Go, take her inside. Yes, take her. Lay a bed for her. She is the daughter of a big house! Those who care for orphans have the hand of God on them. What will she take from here. If it is her fate, she'll eat here. Yes, feed her well Tau, you are great! Mother, for me you had to listen to all this. What difference does it make if an elder sister says something... ...to a younger sister. Mother, does this elder sister always talk like this? I don't feel bad if she says anything against me. But when she... Understood. Mother can tolerate anything, but can't hear a bad word against... ...her son. Mother, was your son like this from birth? No. When he was 8-9 years old he was a sweet lad. Then one... ...day his kite got entangled on an electric pole. When he went... ...to retrieve it, he was eloctrocuted and his hand, legs... ...were damaged. Since then we have visited numerous doctors... ...but of no avail. We couldn't do anything to help. I am shocked to hear this. Is an electric shock so strong? Yes, it brings light to the world, but here it brought darkness. Radha, don't listen to mother. She keeps abusing electricity... ...day and night. The whole village has electricity but in this. ...Biggest house we have oil lamps. I was mauled, and she... ...cut the house electric connection. If there was no ...electricity how would have these factories functioned? How would have these mills run? And yes, millions travel by train. Sometimes there are accidents. Does it mean we stop travelling by train? I wonder by such arguments, whom does he convince. Mother, there is such enthusiasm & hope in your son's talk! Then why are you sounding so despondent? Hey you girl, you talk too big! What work do you have here? What ever you order! No one orders here. Mother... ...has brought you here so that you decorate this house with... ...love and affection and keep my mother so engaged that she ...stops worrying about me! Radha, consider this as your own house and add to the harmony. Mother, speak softly. If Tau hears this, she will be... ...sent packing today itself. What is it? I have come to bathe you! How did the sun rise from the west today? The sun may rise from anywhere. My duty is to serve you! Hold it! Stand in front! Yes, at ease. When did you change your religion? Tell me what work have you got? Just now the postman has delivered a letter. Is Sham coming? No, my brother's son, Navrangi Lal and his sister Neelima are... ...coming from Singapore. Have they left Singapore? Yes, they have. They are about to reach India. My skin is burnt! Burnt! Water is absolutely cold, so how has your skin burnt? Water is cold, but hearing you, my heart has started burning. Go ahead, what else has your Navrangi Lal written? He has written that though he has a 100 places where he can... ...stay, he wants to stay with me. And after all, after my ...brothers death, who has he got except me. What else has he written? He has written how is brother in law. How is his health? I am coming after 20 years. Perhaps he won't even... ...recognise me. It is not difficult to recognise people from your family. It is... ...written on their faces. - Tell me what should I write? Write whatever you want. Pour the water. But what should I write on your behalf. Write Brother in law is having a bath. And that you are pouring... ...water on my back with love, but he feels that someone... ...is stabbing him from the back. Stop fooling. Should I call them? Why are you wasting a 4 paise card! They will land up here,... ...I will just inform the villagers that Navrangi Lal is coming. ...Please latch your doors, and then go to sleep at night! You haven't changed! Manmauji, this is my fatherlandl Call it your motherland. No. My father was an Indian, but my mother was from Goa. If they had married after Goa's independence, I would have ...called myself an Indian. I am half foreign and half Indian. Neelima, my sister. Come, I will show you my fatherlandl Where are you going? To the fair! Let me take you to the fair, whole town is mad after you. Looking at your beauty, world should'nt defame you Don't think I am innocent, my beauty is a pill of poison. Don't you dare to take my name. you group of mad lovers! If your veil slips, your tresses spread out! If you gaze down, your beauty blossoms. The whole world is after me, I am just fed up, but... ...I am still an unmarried lady come somebody take my name. In the eyes of the world, my youth stands out! I wonder how many hearts, are dangling on my nose ring! Since you are in your 16th year, your whole body has awakened. And all with a heart are running after you, and nobody works! Why are you dancing like monkeys by the road side. You clown, are you trying to make fun of us! Don't you know it is a rural dance? What rural dance? With such beautiful girls, you are... ...just raising hands and dancing separately! One boy and one ...girl, and hands around the waist. Wait, I will show you. I wonder whose dress you have stolen! Shut up Manmauji, just tell him, who am I? I know you. From your face you look like a crow, and you have... ...a bearing just like that of a donkey. Leave him, Govind. He does not know the village ethics. He is... ...a foreigner. Who are you? Is that a pig tail! Sir, take care or else these villagers will bury you alive... ...in these sugarcane fields. Sugarcane fields! Manmauji get my gun! Now sir, do your calculations and tell us what does future... ...hold for this house now? Ok, take any day's name. Saturday. In my calculations too saturn is only coming. I think Narangi has come! Narangi! My Aunt! You just now said, Saturn is coming. Yes, he has come! Priest please go. It shouldn't happen that you too get eclipsed. Go from here! Go! I am seeing you after ages. You have become Ieaner, but... ...you are as sweet as before. Narangi, my fortunes have opened today. God bless you. Greetings, Auntie. Neelima, you are grown so big! If my brother was alive, he would have seen in what grand... ...style they are living. And him? Is he her husband? Auntie, you talk like a child. Can we ever get Neelima... ...married without asking you? He is Manmauji, my secretary. Meaning an aide de camp Understood, an accountant! Yes. God bless you. Sir, the taxi fare! My god, I forgot. Do you have Rs 20? I have Singapore notes. They can be exchanged at the bank only. Why Rs. 20? I have several such amounts. Give! I will count ...it myself. Here is your fare. go. You just stay here. As a good omen, let me put some oil on.. ...The fire. Have you seen, Manmauji? What a grand reception our... ...Auntie has accorded to us. But sir, you got a... ...welcome at the fair also! Don't act smart! Come inside children! Manmauji take baggage inside. Auntie has a good house. It is old but as good as the Taj Mahal! Who is this old man? I am one who married your aunt when she was young. Auntie, I had told you so many times in my letter, cut our... ...uncle's head! What did you say? I meant to cut off that tail, what do you call it here? We call it Chutiya. Yes, chutiya, and give him a hair cut. My Navrangi is giving you such good advice. What are you looking at. These children have come from so far. Extend your hand in blessings! He has already soiled it by... ...shaking my hand earlier. I will go & wash it. Go! Auntie, I will correct him totally before I leave. Auntie, who are these people? He is my brother in law, ...and this is his elder son! You have such bad stars! Do you know how they behaved with me at the fair? What happened, son? They tried to strangle me. I will let the dog after them. See! My brother's son has come and enroute only you started to... ...beat and misbehave with him! My god, they have turned out to be relatives! Let us forget about.. ...Fighting. Go and wash your face, today Auntie has made a ...lot of delicacies for you. And uncle has made some sweets... made of grass etc! Please control your tongue. They are Auntie's relatives. So I am just fooling around! Why are you wasting time with them, let us go up. Auntie the place is good, but there is no electricity. Now that you have come, we will have lights all over! That is all right. See what I have brought for you. See that horse. And this is a monkey. He drinks Scotch. Drinks scotch? Scotch means grape wine! Aha! grape juice! How many kids do you have? All I have is only you That is there, but uncle has turned out to be quite a miser. He didn't give you one kid! See how many toys I have... ...brought for your children. Gopi, I am sure your brother... ...in law has done something. - But he has two sons. One is that lame boy and other is Sham. He studies in city.. He is very good. He listens to meHe listens to you? Yes! Then he'll be of some use some day. The world has gone ahead And our world is going backwards. By cows and goats... ...all staying under one roof, politics is surely encouraged. Abroad, as soon as a child is born, he is handed over to nurse. He drinks bottle milk and grows. As soon as he grows, he gets... ...a room. And once he gets married, he gets a house! And when ever he desires, he goes and meet mom and dad! Does it happen like that abroad? Here it is the opposite. I cook, and everybody eats! That brother n law, that lame... Navrangi, listen to me, what are you looking out at? Who is this girl? is she your brother in law's daughter? No, she is a servant! - Great, she is more beautiful... ...than the household people. What is her name? Radha. I wonder where have they picked her from. She is an orphan. Auntie, so what if she is an orphan! Come, why are you wasting your time discussing a servant. Neelima, your brother has made his first move! You don't understand. This house is an institution. And I am a ...new student. And that is why I must understand each thing here. Navrangi, I don't have an issue Do whatever pleases you Auntie, don't you worry. I will completely change the... ...complexion of people here. These gold ornaments of yours... ...none of it will stay. What? I mean, now I will make ornaments of pearls! Son, today my heart is at peace. Now give me your word. You and Neelima will not leave this house, till I die. Auntie, I have come from afar for this purpose only. Auntie just touch my head with affectionGod bless you. Clouds flying in the blue skies, please come here and... ...bring shade to our fields burning in the sun. You hidden birds in the fields, go, go away! The grain is yet too raw, when it ripens, you may eat. The cool waters flowing in the beds! What if they kiss your feet, oh, queen of the fields! Kissing my feet it will become mine. I am a slave of the fields.. ...And you are the king. May the Lord protect these green fields A single grain produces a million if Lord wishes. The lord listens to those who work hard. Keep your arms open, the Lord will fill it up. What to do, this is a local biscuit. There is no butcher's ...shop in the village. Otherwise I would have got meat for you. Let some money come, I will get you tinned meat from the city. Manmauji, is this a time to sleep? Come on, go out! Can't you see, she has come to sweep! Good you woke me up, else I would have been swept out! I saw a broom is a delicate hand. It is like seeing a potato... ...on a flowering tree! Your eyes are so intoxicating, and the face so titillating. And on top she sweeps! What an insult to beauty. Please look this side! Speak please! Why are you punishing yourself? This age, this height this beauty. If you say it, I will get rid of this broom for you forever! What can't you do, if you so wish! You are a big man. Radha, you have recognised me. From the time I have entered ...this house, no one has called me a big man. Radha, how did... ...you recognise I was a big man? Big men are recognised by their face only. These finely stitched... ...clothes, your posture, your style...if you give biscuits to ...your dog, I wonder what you must be eating! I respect your judgement. Just imagine if I can give biscuits... ...to dogs, what all can I give you. I can change these cheap... ...cotton clothes to those of silk. And your dry lips with lipstick... ...will look like burning red fire. And your hair, will become curly. You understand what I am saying Take it that your days have changed. The days of poverty... ...are gone! Did it go away from this door? Yes. I closed it, so that it doesn't return! Close the door properly. And put the latch, lest ... ...somebody listen. Govind, what noise is this? They say, Lord's stick does not make noise. Yet I do hear it Let us see what is happening! Leave it, the meeting must... ...be getting over. Radha, have you sweeped? Radha, what was happening on top? You don't have much brains. Cant you see the broom in her hand? She has swept everything there! - Is that so? God bless you! Auntie! Autie! What happened, son? Ask what has not happened! Speak son! What will he say? If it was worth speaking, he would have. By his tone understand what happened! Auntie, you pour the oil, and he ignites it! I can't stay here even for a minute here, now. Since you have come, this is the first time you talked sense. After all what has happened brother? Nothing and everything. Now even my dog won't stay here. Your dog is smarter than you. He has already left. What is the hurry. Wait for some more time. Why are you stopping him. He is leaving at an auspicious time. Let him go! Yes, I'm going. But I hadn't consulted astrologers to go. Come Neelima, Manmouji, get the suitcases! Farewell to you! You had given me a word. Till I die, you will not go from here. Neelima, are you also going? Yes! Where my brother is not... ...respected, I cannot stay there. Me too. I cannot stay here. Sham, you have come at the right time, son. See, here is my Sham. His mother gave him birth, but he is my son! Auntie, who are these people? They are my brother's children. He is Navrangi. Hello. And this is Neelimal Neelimal She often used to remember you, that her brother;s daughte... ...lives in Singapore. Yes. Did your Auntie ever remember me? Oh, yes. Shamu, you have come. I would have come to the station with ...vehicle to receive you. Oh, man from Singapore. Here is my brother. You used to throw ...your English at me. Calling me fool and a rascal! Govind! Don't interfere. Sham, give him a few abuses in English! Will you keep quiet now. Sham, these people have come to stay... ...with us from such a distance but these illiterates have really... ...made a nuisance of themselves here. Guests, and going away annoyed, how can that happen? It is good I came. Now they will not go anywhere. With great difficulty they are going. Don't stop them, Shamu Seen? What is the difference between an educated man, and... ...an illiterate? Have you seen that? You are two brothers but how different from each other! Besides you and Auntie, rest are all shepherds are. Yes, we are! But we are not thieves like you. Come, let us meet mother, she is anxious to meet you. What are you staring at that colored parrot for? We cannot do that. After all, they are our guests. I don't feel like, but since a decent person is calling us... ...with so much love, I cannot refuse. What do you ...say Neelima. Ok, brother. Manmauji, take back the baggage. Shamu, when did you come? Just now Uncle. Since last one hour he is outside, but these people... ...did not leave him at all. You have returned! We have'nt come, but were called You go ahead, I will meet mother and come in five minutes. What is happening to Sham. He is delaying to meet mother! Father, see who has come! Sham, welcome. Mother! God bless you. You look so pulled down. He must not be getting... ...milk and curd in the city. Mother, we get everything there. But to parents the son always.. ...Looks pulled down after a long separation! Come, sit down! How are your studies getting along. You will surely pass?! Is this anything to ask. He will come first! Radha, this is my Shamu. Get him a glass of buttermilk. Mother, why were Navrangi and Neelima going away so soon? They are going, son. This is not good mother. If I hadn't interfered they would have already departed! Shamu, with great difficulty they were going, but U stopped them. Those crooks were going out you brought them down! See, mother, how does brother talk about them! They will think... ...we are illiterate fools! Let them think like that! Who bothers about them. Govind, will you keep quiet! That Navrangi is coming, take Sham inside. Sham you said you are coming in a minute, it is now more than ...half an hour now. You are an educated man. Keep your time. Why are you spoiling my clothes? Sham let us go to the roof, what cool breeze is blowing. You go! Shamu has come home after such a long time. Will you.. ...Leave us alone in peace! Horrible. In this house no one respects an educated person. Sham, Neelima is waiting alone on top! Why alone? The dog is there! Mother, please advise brother. Shamu, nobody can do it, I say whatever I feel like. You should have stopped Sham. What's the use. He is grown up. He should understand what is... ...good and bad for him. Father, I will say one thing. In their company there is nothing ...good, and he will lose his way. Mother, keep a close watch on Shamu. If he gets trapped... ...by these, everything will get spoiled Neelima was becoming tired of waiting for you, Sham... She became mad, the moment she set her eyes on Sham... Since we have come to this village, there are either Babool... ...trees or nitwits of this house. Looking at you it appears as if from a dry mountain side, a ...spring has welled up! Tell me, are you fond of a shoot! Why not, make a programme! We will go! But what hunt? Tiger, Ieapord, deer, rabbit, partridge or.. beer. Whatever you desire. Idea is to have a good time. Time will be well spent, now that you have come. You chit chat. I will find out where one gets good game. You go and take the dog for a walk. Sit down! Has your exam started? No. But my exam has started. Meaning? I am trying to study. On the face is written, that the heart.. ...Must be equally beautiful. So you are trying to read me. Parvati's status has raised in status as she has two kids All at home only respect her. Everyone who comes, keep ...singing her praises. My name is Bhagwanti! If I don't teach them.. ...A lesson, then my birth is wasted! Auntie I will tell you a way! What is it? Sit down! Sham is an educated boy. He has seen the glitter of... ...the new age in the city. Why not seal a relationship with... ...Neelima. She will bear over him like a heavy cloud after marriage Children will be born, and they will get right over the property. And who will give a girl to that lame duck. We can snatch ...his share too. Genius! Wait I will put a ...black mark on you, so that no one casts an evil eye on you. But why a black spot? For what? So that your enemies don't cast any evil on you. Wow, you are brushing your teeth in the english way! Ok, get ready fast. Mother is calling you for breakfast. No need to come here. You could have called me from there. If I have come so far, what problems have come to me? Shamu, you did not get anything from the city for me. You forgot Govind. Perhaps you had to come in a hurry. Shamu, may I take out water for a bath for you? I am quite mad. I promised you water, but how will I pull out... ...the bucket from the well. I will take out the water for the little master! Yes, Radha you do this work. Shamu, hurry. Mom is making hot buttered bread! Mom is right. Sham has in fact become quite weak. Govind, what're you doing. Can't Sham sit down & have breakfast Mom, you don't know these college kids. They sit on chairs... ...and have breakfast on a table. You go! Come, breakfast is waiting for you on the top. Mom has made my breakfast. Everyone is waiting for me. I love potato paratha. Whenever I come home, Mom... ...makes them for me whenever I come. After studying so much, you are still hung on these rustic dishes! Poor Neelima has laid the table with such care and love. Come let us go up! Govind, you go ahead and have breakfast. How long will you wait? Should I eat alone? I will ...wait for Shamu to come. Radha, Is Shamu still bathing? He has already had his bath. Now he is having his breakfast. Breakfast? Yes, with them Mom, I told you keep an eye on Shamu. Those who came only... ...yesterday are now more dear to him. I will take breakfast to him. I will see how he doesn't eat. Son, why do you wish to get involved with them. I am just going to my younger brother. He hasn't eaten anything. - Neelima too hasn't eaten. I think they are satiated just looking at each other. What have you brought? Not for you. If you don't like sitting down and eating then eat here only.. This has been made by mom, with her own hands. But he has already eaten! Girl. don't interfere... ...when two men are talking Brother, if I had breakfast for one day with them, what is ...the harm? If you eat, mother's heart will bless you, and if you don't ... ...it will curse you. Really? If that be so, keep the plate here. The dog will eat it. What are you standing here for. Go away! Since I have come, I am stuck here like a prisoner. Why not... ...go out for a change? Yes, Sham, it is a good idea. Go. You can go now! Come, let us dance. Let us romance! Our lives have been decided when our eyes met. Life is dull, But in a second it can be beautiful. Just do me a favor, and make my life green! I am a traveller from afar, but I am at your service. I seek the dense shade, off your dark tresses. My heart too is thirsty for you! The weather is ideal for love and romance. Then why shouldn't life appear so joyful. Leave the world which may try and obstruct our love but... ...I am quite clear on my intent, what about you? My heart too is thirsty for you, my beloved. You saw Shankar, this was our Shamu. How shameful. Just... ...no consideration of family name. No care! He is having such an open affair with this girl! Yes, brother. The matter has crossed all limits. God guide us. Shankar, do you remember? Harprasad of Nlotichur had ...sought a relationship for his two daughters last year?. If Shamu is ready to marry his younger daughter, then he is ... ...prepared to get his elder daughter married to Govind. That time we had avoided this issue. Yes, but now to save Shamu and get a bride for Govind too, ...I think we should agree to his terms. I will go to Nlotichur tomorrow itself and finalise the deal. What do these oldies know, that Sham has already been auctioned. Auntie, get up and alert yourself. What is the matter, Navrangi. Those two oldies are planning to put our plans in cold storage! What? Yes, I heard it with my own ears! They are finalising Shams marriage with a daughter... ...of some landlord of Nlotichur. Till I am alive, why are you afraid. I am not even afraid of God. But to get alerted at the sign... ...of danger is a sign of intelligence. All moves on the... ...chessboard of this house are against us. You can control only.. ...One pawn Sham which you can move around and win. If he gets away from our hands, it means our defeat and... ...victory to our enemies. What have you thought of, Navrangi? I have thought of everything. I am looking for an opportunity. I will put such an explosive, this house will be smashed to bits. And the biggest piece will be...Ours! Radha! Coming! What is this? You have mixed my clothes with these dirty ones. They are not coarse cotton, but pure silk! Watch out, don't wash my clothes with this local soap. Where have they got this country pumpkin from? Pardon me, but this is the tradition of this house. All clothes will be washed together. I will wash yours... ...once again. Radha, what has happened to you. Our clothes are clothes... ...of decent folks. Why have you mixed such rotten clothes with ...ours. Do you wish us to soil our religion? How dare you? For a two penny servant, you are insulting me! Don't dare call Radha a servant! Here there is no servant. From today she will not wash your clothes. Pick up... ...your clothes, and wash them yourself! Which hell has my brother got me. I'll just teach you a lesson. Yes, go ahead. See Radha, here you gain nothing by keeping quiet. What are you simply staring at? Wash your clothes. There is no place for me. I feel suffocated here. Why stay in ...such a house. Sham, do you wish I be treated like a servant? What is the matter? What can it be. Your brother... ...wishes that I wash my clothes myself. Let my people say anything. You are concerned with me. Look this side. I wish to make you mine for my life ...rudely with my sister. And your brother is no less. He too is trying to be nasty. Get one thing clear. Nobody bothers about you. And nobody... ...listens to your auntie! In such condition how can we stay here! Is that so? We will decide on it today itself! You have insulted Neelimal Then should Radha take insults from her? Has now Radha become Neelima's equal? Do you know who Neelima is? I do not. But if you know, then tell me. Then hear me. Neelima is half mistress of this place. Mistress? Wah, Shamu. I don't think you eat opium nuggets. Brother, I am going to marry Neelima. Sham, what is it? Aunt, this marriage should as conducted as early a spossible.. Sham, are you finalising your own marriage? Till now I am alive. In addition my father like elder brother... ...is also there. I know. How can Neelima get married to Sham? She is my... ...brother's daughter. They hate my family since birth When did I say that Sham and Neelima cannot get married. If you like this relationship then... This marriage cannot take place. We cannot forget our traditions. In this house who ever has got married has done it with the ...consent of elders. When Govind is still a bachelor, how can... ...the younger one get married. But the country I come from, the younger brother does not wait... ...for the elder to get married. Don't forget, at the moment you are in India. Get lost now! So Shamu, you will remain a bachelor till your handsome ...brother does not get married. And no father will be so cruel, that he gives his daughters ...hand in marriage who cannot even hold her hand. But may be a person, who wants to rid oneself of girl... ...might agree. Listen to me. Take priesthood. Since ages India has not had a saint. And life without marriage... ...is like a car without petrol! Perhaps you can marry after ...your elder brother's death. But he may not die for the next.. ...25 to 50 years. He massages himself with oil and eats well Neither can he get married, nor... ...will he die earlier. So become a priest! You will remain a bachelor till your elder handsome brother... ...gets married. There will be no father who will willingly give... ...his daughter's hand in his. But if there is some body under ...compulsion, he may benefit. Become a priest. As it is, ... ...there hasn't been a saint in India for ages. Or you can ...marry after your elder brothers death. But he is not going to ...die easily. He massages himself with oil and eats good food. So neither is he going to get married nor is he going to die... ...soon. So become a priest! What were you going to do? Nothing Radha. I was looking into the well to see if the ...waters will accept me. You used to laugh off the biggest problems, then how... ...did you think of committing suicide? If somebody gains from my death it is not called suicide. My life won't benefit anone on this earth. Then why should I... ...be an obstruction to others. Shamu is of a marriagable age... ...but he cannot marry till I get married! And I cannot get married. Then why should I snatch my ...brother's happiness. But why have you thought that you cannot get married. He may be a bad man, but what ever he said is entirely true. Who will give his girl to me? Which girl will wish to wed me Why? I am lame and handicapped! Why should I spoil any innocent girl's life? Instead of being a support, why should I be a liability on her. Till today I have not sinned, and will not do so in the future. Radha, truly speaking I do not wish to marry! Is that your final decision? What else is left? Then permit me. I will go very far from here Why Radha? I thought I will stay here, serve somebody. But it appears... ...nobody needs me. What is the use of my staying here now. Radha, I have understood. But I don't wish for anyone's pity. Since you have come, you look after me. You help me. But I do not wish to punish you for the favors you have done. Don't do such a favor, that under its heavy load I die. I am not doing any favor. If you give me a place at your feet... ...my good days will return. Otherwise I am an orphan. I've... ...no place. I will simply remember the good times I have.. ...Had in this house and cry by myself and spend my life Radha, why do you wish to bring darkness in your life in order to.. ...Bring light into mine? See this! And see this! This hand cannot work. It cannot protect you. After marriage, a husband's job is to protect his wife. But you ...wish to place your future in one who is crying & will... ...make others cry. In this world there are all types of girls. But there are many... ...who don't see a husbands hands and legs, but see their... ...heart and mind. I have seen your soul. For god's sake... ...let me stay here. Govind, if she herself says that you should hold her hand,... ...then why are you avoiding it! Mother, are you also supporting her? Think, if she was your daughter, and I of some one else, would... ...you have given her hand happily into mine? I had come as a servant to this house. If you bless me, I will... ...become your daughter in law. We cannot be more fortunate, that a girl as good and... ...beautiful becomes our daughter-in-law. We accept you. And I am confident Govind will not ... ...disobey his parents. The younger one gets married to my sister. And the elder one... ...to a servant! Congratulations. Here are your marriage gifts to you. What is this? Dowry for my sister's marriage! My sister will sweep with this broom and collect cowdung in... this basket after marriage. Brother! What is this joke? This is reality! Govind's marriage has been finalised with Radha. Marriage! To a servant of the house! That is what I am crying for. After marriage, Neelima's status.. ...Will be equated with a servant. It looks you too have got on to their side. What nonsense? What do you think? I will give my sister's hand into a house ...where elder son's wife is washing clothes at the well the... ...whole day! There is a limit to being insulted, Lets go from here. Don't do anything in haste. Do you think that I am happy at ...the news. My heart has broken after hearing this. This girl, who has no caste or relatives. how can she be our... ...daughter in law? Give up this crying. Who listens to you in this house? When she was a servant, she beat me. And if she becomes... ...the daughter in law, she will beat me with shoes! Auntie, I cannot sell my self respect so that you prosper! How can one without any respect sell his respect? Here is the villain. First he married you & left you childless. After that he ensured that your Sham also separates from you. Navrangi, If you utter a word against my elder brother, ...I'll pull out your tongue. Do you think that I will watch quietly when you pull my tongue My blood will cry out the true facts then also. Navrangi, forget about these things. Think about the solution. I have thought of it. Till you divide the house into two,... ...parts, tell uncle you will not stay here. What did you say? How dare you make such a statement! I won't .. First you got after my family. Now you dare raise your hand... ...on my family's only surviving issue, my nephew! There will be division of this house. Surely it will be! Please come to your senses! Don't tell me anything! Auntie, ask for your half. If this old man dies, they will make ...you beg on the streets. I know it Navrangi. I know each utensil of this house.. I will ensure now that here is a division. We separate. Even the kitchen will be separated. I will take into account each cloth and each grain! Till now I was in the dark. You have opened my eyes today. Hear me. If we don't have a partition of this house,... ...I will hang myself and die Should I get the rope. Once you hang yourself, I will sort each... ...one of them afterwards What are you looking at? I am not threatening. I will do what... ...I have said. Go hang yourself. But this house is like a string of pearls. I'll ...not allow any pearl to be dispersed. I will see how you don't do it I'll ensure division of everything Why are you talking like a child. This house, this property, these... ...lands are all yours. What ever is here is my brother's hard ... ...earnings. We are just caretakers. Put everything in... ...your name, but don't talk of division. Auntie, all this is just talk. Don't get carried away. Don't I know him? I am asking for my right, not begging! Your uncle desires that the entire property goes to that lame duck. Think, sister. Do you think we begot children so that we ...become the masters! Sister, make me do anything, but let... ...not two brothers separate. I will not listen to anything. I have decided. Now nobody can... ...make me change my mind. Come Navrangi. What did I think, and what has happened? Due to me, now this world will be divided into two! I cannot see this. I thought by finding a place here, I will take... ...care of this house. But by this if there is a split, then give... ...me permission to go. Do you feel by your going away the house will not be split? I have been seeing it for several days, that there has been some... ...smoke coming out from somewhere. And this smoke had to lead to fire one day which happened now How long will you be quiet. I've spoken to the Village Assembly. They said if you go & say, they they will divide the property. I touch your feet, don't destroy the family. The family has ...always remained united like nest. Don't break it. Why are you tying Shankar in this. If the split is agreeable... ...to him, why are you objecting. I know him very well. He considers you like his mother. You made a lot of hue & cry & that poor chap must've agreed Beside Shankar and his children, whom have we got?. Don't talk of a division. Look, don't cry like a woman in front of me. I've lived with you... ...for thirty years. Have you ever agreed to any point of mine? There will be division. Or else I will set myself on fire! Do what you want then? Burn the entire family to ashes. Go!! I know my Shankar will never misunderstand me. He is my... ...brother. He is like a son to me. Hurry up. Now read out the paper on the division. In front of the Village Assembly, the two brothers Jeewan Lal &... ...Shankar Lal's joint property is being divided equally. Collectively they have 100 acres. This is being divided equally ...between the brothers. Remaining cows, horses, goats, vessels... ...are divided equally. The house which is in the village is being... ...divided equally into two by erecting a wall. Thereafter they will not interfere into each other's lives. Is it agreeable to you both? Head Man, Silence means both agree! Shankar, I am elder to you. Somehow I had maintained the... ...respect of this house till now. Only the house members knew... ...what was happening inside. But today everyone knows how... ...many utensils & clothes we've! Shankar, the house may be split. But there is no assembly which can split the two of us. Whether you stay on this side or that, we will continue to remain... ...brothers. No one can split our love. Whatever is happening is due to compulsion. Don't mistake me Forgive me! Can't it happen that my body is divided into two. One stays in... ...your part of the house, and one in mine. How can I stay alone? How are you alone? Nobody except death can separate us. Brother! Strange people. By crying you have made garbage here. You farmers smile. You will not count the bread the other eats! We of the assembly have nothing to do with your internal fights. We have divided the property into two equal halves You have done justice. but not with my sister. She is a victim... ...of injustice. How is that? Sham is getting married to Neelima, my sister. From Shankar's share half is Govind's and half is Sham's. Why shouldn the division amongst brothers not be done now, ...or else the assembly will have to take the trouble once again. Who are you to ask for the brothers division? Our fathers hand is on our head! - It will not remain so forever Today your father is separating from his brother. And if you think I am wrong, go and ask your brother. Shamu, come here. Does he think Shamu and Govind are two ...separate persons! Shut this person's mouth! Shamu, say it! I've nothing to say. Whatever he says is agreeable to me Shamu, is that you speaking? Why didn't I die before this. When Govind's leg and hand... ...were damaged, I cried and prayed. When you were born... ...my tears stopped. I thought that to help Govind, God gave... ...you to me. I thought you will help your brother at each step. But now listening to him, you have forgotten your family. Tell me, will you ask for your share and leave him without... ...support? Yes, I will. I will. Take my heart and auction it in the market! Mother! Leave him. When our own blood has rebelled, why make a scene. Make their division also. Sham you also listen. From today, ...we are not yours, and you are not ours. And write this also in.. ...This paper, that on my death, he will not even touch my dead... ...bodyl He will not light my pyre. He is not my son! Whenever I remember the good times, I will remember that ...somewhere I too had a abode where I could rest! Yesterday there was a paradise, but today it is hell. What has happened in front of our eyes gradually I have no sorrow about this destruction. Regrets are on why there was a debate on this destruction. I had a small abode... Today each shred has separated from the other. Looking at my house, I think I have seen it before! Those who were observing, saw only the smoke. Who has seen my heart burning? Play it loudly. I will fill your pockets! How is Shankar now? Is he getting better with medicines? I am putting in my best efforts. For two days his eyes were closed. Now he talks. His heart... ...is broken. He keeps crying the whole time. This crying is for a life time. Whatever expenditure is there, .. ...Take it from me, don't take from Shankar. Agreed everything is divided. But can't one brother see another? My wife says, if you visit Shankar it will be over her... ...dead body. She doesn't realise that I am a living dead person. Where is this Shahnai being played? Today is our Sham's wedding. Sham's wedding! Lots of big people must have come.. It is taking place without parents, without elder brother. How unlucky am I, that I can't bless my son, in his marriage. Parents' blessings are always with the children! How has this creature come in. Navrangi, where are you? Shamu, congratulations! Father is very sick. He wants to see you. Mother wishes to see you dressed up like a groom. Come with me for two minutes. I remember very well what father had said. That he doesn't.. ...Want to see me, and on death I should not touch his dead body You remember all this, but father has forgotten everything. When we were kids, didn't he beat us? Did we ever go into a... ...sulk. After growing up, does it mean we now get annoyed on ...small things? When a hen hides her brood under her... ...the chicks never feel she will strangle them. Neelima, I am elder to you, and in relations too I am a senior. You are now the daughter in law of this house. Pardon me if I ...have annoyed you in any way. Just once take Shamu and do ...a round that side. Father will be very happy. Father doesn't like her one bit. Will he get happy seeing her... ...as a bride, today? Shamu, forget the past. Our relation is that of blood. Come Shamu, your father is calling you. He considers you... ...as his support for old age. Govind, you are wasting our time. Come with me, Neelima. Shamu, do you realise what you are doing. You have just wedded.. ...A stranger and think the world of her. But behind this wall is... ...another woman, who brought you into light from darkness! But this woman is sitting with a sick man, praying that her ...husband does not die, that she does not become a widow. Come! Take him out! Push him outside! Navrangi, don't you dare touch my son! I will cut you into ...pieces and feed the dogs! Come forward, anyone! I will come in front. You dare come! Uncle! Today is Shamu's wedding Don't do such a thing Do you call this a marriage? This is a death ceremony Leave them. I pray to you. Leave them. Ok, son. Now go to your house. Let these dogs bark. Brother! Don't do such a thing. My sickness has been cured by my brother. And the worry of... ...Govind's marriage has been cleared by you. Parents are... ...worried for a daughters marriage. And we were worried... ...for our son's marriage. God did a cruel act by snatching... ...away your parents. For you God is heartless. But for us... ...he has been kind that he has sent you after you were orphaned You held the hand of my son, who was unfit to hold an ... ...one's hand. Rest now, father. I will get your medicine. Now I will look forward to living to see my grandchildren ... ...play in my lap. Lord, when Lakshman fell sick, you brought the rare Sanjeevani... ...to cure him. I too am your devotee. Call me to you, but... ...let not anything happen to Shankar. I am a sinner. But ...hear me. For sake of Parvati, Radha and Govind, extend the ...life of my brother, Shankar. Brother! Shankar! Why did you come out so soon? You should have rest ...for a few more days. With your blessings I am all right. I came to you for taking... ...permission for an important issue. Sit down. What is it? I thought I should now get Radha and Govind married. Why not? This happy event should be held as early as... ...possible. Don't worry about anything. I have set aside money.. ...For Govinds marriage. Spend as much as you want. Hold it with... ...great show. He is our first son. Ther aree many auspicious... ...days next week. Get them married on any one day. Listen, you are going alone. Shankar, for days we have'nt... ...walked together. Let us walk up to the house together. Come. A registered letter? What is it, brother-in-law First they used to come to me, now you are getting them. Have a close look. I hope it is not a registered notice. Brother, do talk good things for a change! I had applied for a managerial post in the city, in a factory. Its reply has come. I have got the post. within a week... ...I have to join. See, how fortunate is Neelima's coming home. Ok, now lets us... ...have sweets. Mother! What is it? Radha now-a-days doesn't bathe me. I asked her to pour water,... and she ran away! Now, she will do all this service only after marriage. Oh, mom. I talk of a bathe, and you talk of marriage. Govind's mother! Brother has given permission. And I have taken out a date. Date for what, father? Are you going to break down the wall? Yes, but the wall between you and Radha. Your marriage date is fixed for day after. Come, now... ...there is very little time, and lots of work. I will go to give the invitation to Shamu for the marriage. Why? Did he call you for his marriage? You were going to... ...get beaten up instead Look, Shamu is younger. If he acts foolishly, should I do the... ...same? I will definitely go! Listen, don't go there? Why not? You too had gone... ...to your brother to seek his permission. You will be insulted there. It does not matter. But I will go. Come, Mr Lame duck. You have'nt left us here also, to make our... ...heaven into hell! Navrangi, don't say anything now. Has a mad dog bitten me? I have been searching for you. Listen to me. Come this side. What is it? Say some thing! I am getting married! - Marriage? With whom? With Radha. It is true. Myself and Radha are getting married. Bring Neelima and do come for the marriage. Did you hear? He is calling me also. Yes, first you. Earlier there was discord. Perhaps my marriage... ...will mend broken relationships. I have come with great hopes! What are we coming down to. We have to attend a servant's... ...marriage. isn't Radha the same girl who raised her hand... ...on my brother. If she had raised her hand, I would have held it. But she... ...raised a broom! Haven't you insulted my brother enough, that you wish to again... ...insult us. You are expert in adding to the fire! Neelima, you keep quiet. Brother, it is better you go. Listen, give military orders to him. Just get out from here. I have enemity with whatever is old. Navrangi, I understand what is old fashioned and what is new. If one says yes to bad things, then one is new and educated. One who respects his parents, is considered old fashioned. One who forgets his parents, does not visit them and... ...forgets them after marriage, and never come to even meet ...them, he is new and intelligent! Don't argue about the new and old here. Why are you jealous... ...if he has got a new world beautiful wife? To you the ... ...servant be welcome. Wife and a servant too. Get children ...produced by her, or get the house swept from her. Why should I be jealous. I feel pity for my brother. We follow.. ...The Ramayana. We know how to die for our brothers! Which holy books have you read. In our books, it is written Bali... ...was killed by his true brother, Sagreev. And Ravan by Vibhishan. Keep your books to yourself. We are all educated. You cannot.. ...Fool us with this talk. Shamu, you might be quite educated. But the books don't ...teach whom to associate with. If you were so wise, you would... ...not have got fooled my the shine of brass, and... ...mistake it for gold. I think he has come to know that Shamu has got a job. That is how he has come wagging his tail for his brother. He is trying to make some bread for himself. I spit on such bread which is earned by some one else. Do you think I will break bread of a person who has forgotten... ...his parents? Even a dog will not eat bread of such a person. Why eat, he will not even sniff at it? Have you heard. He is calling you a dog! And you are not even ...biting, or even barking! Govind, I am fed up listening to your nonsense. Get out from here Shamu, this Navrang has many colours like a chameleon. He keep changing them. You better be careful of him. It is the limit. He keeps talking nonsense, and you keep listening! Neelima, till today I kept quiet for you are my brother's wife. Other wise what would you have done? Speak! Navrangi! Shamu, you have done a good thing. Slowly, I am recognising you too. Lord, for me it is all right, but don't show such days to Sham. What has happened to you? Why are you standing so sad? Radha, my heart says I have done injustice to you. Is favor ever injustice? What favor? I am unfit for you. You don't know what you are to me. Everything! You are my temple. You are my prayer. And You are my God! If someone see with my eyes, they will understand... ...what you are to me. Wherever I see, I see only you. Then what thoughts are you lost in? Just smile when you look at me... ...or else I will think, you are annoyed with me. You are the sparkle of the vermillion on my forehead. You are only my destination of the flowers in my hand I am a small earthen doll, you are the life, you are the sky. Now it is quite late night, let me put you to sleep. Let the breeze give the music, I will sing you a Iullaby. Looking at you I feel as if an angel is sleeping. Sham, this is you office. Mr. Roshan LalGood Morning He is our chief accountant. And he is our new manager, Mr Sham. If there is something he doesn't understand, just help him. Whose letter is this? It is his. He said as soon as he gets a house on hire, he will ...immediately call me. He must be sad. He loves you immensely. Auntie, Neelima's worry is over. Sham has a job in the city. I am worrying, where will you eat from? What shortage do I have. I have a house, lands. What more ? Auntie, Govt is passing a law that a man cannot keep more... ...than 1 acre of land. My god, what has happened to the Govt! Is there a solution for this? Why not start some business? We are landlords. Besides farming we have done nothing. Your innocence is heartwarming. What is left in land. Just soil ! Nowadays there are such business that in two days,... ...you put in one, and you get 10 in return. What? What business is that? There are numerous. But the best is of carnival. what is that? Show business. When a man returns home, he brings 10000/-. No credit, all cash. Only Rs 50000 is required. By year end you will be decked in gold from head to foot. You will be putting on a Cashmere Shawl and relaxing! For Uncle also, no simple hair, but modern cut! But where will we get Rs. 50000 from? Auntie, what is this land and house for? We will morgage them and take the money. When the money ...starts rolling in, we will return the debt and free the house. Just convince Uncle! Navrangi, you used to do the same thing in Singapore. isn't it? I made millions and spent millions. If the govt hadn't... ...changed, would I have come here? I have 8 bungalows ...9 cars, two aerodromes and 3 railway stations there! 3 railway stations! Yes, I used to be so busy, sometimes I ...slept on the platform, and sometimes at the airport. And all due to the Carnival. See, I will get the govt papers... ...somehow. Get uncle's signatures on it, and then you... ...will be rolling in wealth. Getting his signature is my job, how dare he not sign. Why not Auntie? You are my father's sister. And my father... ...used to kill tigers by merely winking! What sad meditation are you in? Just sign here. Land is considered our mother, and the house is our ancestors... ...memory. Doing all this is a great sin! You will remain a frog in a well. Navrangi will make five million ...from your Rs. 50000/-. And thereafter our grandchildren will enjoy! Who is there to eat .. ...Of this 5 million? I will eat. I will do charity. I will make a temple. When you make a temple, as a statue put Navrangi there. What is a bigger temple than a house that you want to mortgage ...it and make another. - Don't talk of Navrangi. Poor... ...chap is always worried about you. He keeps asking, ' has... ...uncle eaten? Has he rested?' Ok, I will sign, but on one condition. What is that? Just that from today he will not call me uncle. This is a full R$.5000O/-. Auntie, my head and your blessings means... that this amount multiplies 10 to 20 times & returns to you. Money will beget money. What do you say?it's good. When she moans I get scared. Children give such trouble. But when you have a child in your ... ...yard, you will be filled with happiness.

Mother, he hasn't eaten since morning. He must be hungry. You look after your son's hunger. I will look after mine. God, what should I do? Some body go and get the doctor! Else neither will the... ...child live nor Neelimal What happened, Govind? I will just go to the Doctor & get him here! You have shown mercy here, please show mercy there too. Nothing should happen to my daughter in law. Let there be... ...happiness there too. Hurry up, Doctor. Mother, I have got the doctor! Sister, A son has been born or a girl. A son is born. How is the mother? - With great difficulty, she... ...was saved. But one arm of the child is twisted. Is your heart satisfied now? Every day this lame duck used ... ...to keep peeping into this side. His shadow has fallen this side. Don't talk like that. All this is destiny. Destiny be dammed! I made the wall, but I couldn't stop their evil eye! What will my Sham think. First child and that too twisted! He is a child. His hand can be straightened ! Speak softly. It shouldn't happen that he straightens his own. After showing false love for two days, a man went away. Can any one tell me, how should I keep my heart under control? My youth has gone to dust! Nobody understands my story, Oh lord! He used to offer a Benares sweet betel leaf with love Frequently he used to say, Oh, my sweet heart! When I remember his sweet tongue, Crying copiously my innocent heart says... What? My youth has gone to dust, Oh Lord. Now it is just a question of only two days... ...but without my lover it is impossible to spend the night. I thought this companionship was for life... How did I know all men are like that! If these 4 eyes had not met... Parting wouldn't have been so painful. See how expensive has been this game of love! This is said by none else than the flowing oil of my tresses! My fatherland's currency! Manmauji, these are the diamonds of Bhagwanti Carnaval. These are two rings which can be encashed any where. All this wealth is the result of their youth and beauty. Ask for whatever you wish! What should we ask. Whatever we need we'll take it ourselves But why are you airing this wealth. Keep it in the almirah Yes, let us keep it. Manmauji, get the money. Now you may go, where ever you want to! I wish to talk to both of them for some time. Boss, when should I wake you up? When the moon is coming out, you may wake me. But boss, tell me the time. I don't have a calender. Go! Boss, get up! Is it morning? Has the moon risen? Hurry up. Jati and Sati have elopedl What has happened to Jati, Sati. They have dissappeared! They have run away? You are mad. Where can they go? If they can come, they can go also. Ok, is the safe there only! Safe can go nowhere. See... ...if there is anything inside. Where can it go? Who can... ...touch it. I have the key! The key is there! Listen, where are you? What is it, Radha? Just look after the baby. I am helping mother. I had asked for a wish. When 40 days are over I will go to the... ...temple and worship there! That is very good! Take him along also! No, I will not take him out so soon. Suppose someone... ...casts an evil eye! Ok, then keep him here! I will just go to the goldsmith. I will see if bangles are ready. When you grow up become like Uncle, not like Auntie. You are clever. Hearing her name, you have started crying. Mother, I am messaging since last 40 days. But there is no ...difference in his hand. The Doctor said, keep massaging for 2-3 months. It will become... ...all right. Good he was lame in childhood. See there. Govind ...was born all right, but later he became lame! Now tell, what ...will his child become when he grows up! They keep hiding him... ...as if he is a prince! I will tell you a story. Listen... My son, hear it from me. My son, you are my progeny. You are a boon that I have got from God! I am your father, but I cannot feed you. I cannot pick you up with both hands If you want, I shall become your horse. If I can't become, you will be a little sad. But you should remember one thing, my child Let your mother's heart be filled by your love. Become your mothers guardian, when you grow up. In an unfortunate's house, has been born a fortunate! The strength of your two hands, is your destiny. Hard work is your estate! One with two hands can fight with every difficulty Don't be an obstacle in people's lives. Don't sleep till your neighbor is awake. Only the fortunate take the trouble of others. Where you step, let flowers blossom there. May the parted hearts, reunite once again. Says this moon like face that you are one with love Let me see his face! She has gone outside. Goving, his face is just like that of a king! Why not, he has a face like yours. Have you named him or not? Father has thought of Navjeevan Dass. It is a name, just like mine. Why not? He is your grandson. His Grandpa's name must come. God willing, he will raise the family name and after growing... ...up, he becomes the support of you and Radha. Here! The first time you feed him outside milk, feed him with this. You too eat well. Ok, you go now. Bhago has come. If I have wealth, I will buy the world. Come! Are you playing rummy with all these notes? I was just taking stock of office money. How is the Carnival running? It was running ok, and then it stopped. But it will run again. It stopped! Meaning? What to hide from you. I had two dancers Jati and Sati. They stole our Rs 70,000 and dissappeared. Show has stopped It is bad news. Did you file a police case? Those who have art, do not go to the police. What is this... ...Rs 70000. I will earn 7 million and show you! Instead of Jati... ...and Sati, I am going to buy an elephant. Elephant? Yes, the elephant will show his tricks and make me rich again. But I need your help. Tell me. I need just Rs 10,000 for two days. I will buy the elephant... ...and within two days I will return it. But I don't have that much of money. This wealth lying in front of you is not just earth! But this is office money. You have not understood. This money is lying with you. For two days keep this with me. But this is a question of my job! Will I ever permit you to lose your job. It is just a question... ...of two days. -But... In two days, I will return every penny and with interest. But this is Rs 20,000! Ok here is your Rs 10,000. But return it definitely after two days. Certainly. Have you brought the elephant? Yes, he is standing outside. Then get him inside! How can he come inside? Great, you can get in, but not the elephant! I saw your elephant outside. He is small, but will do. Here is your Rs 10,000. From today the elephant is ours. But remember, if your elephant lets us down during the show... ...then I will get you trampled over by him. Sir, to rear elephants is not only my business. It was of my dad... ...as well as my grandfather. I was brought up in their company. God willing, I too am an elephant! But till he gets used to us, you will stay with us. Ok. I heard your elephant can throw up a child and catch him again! No doubt, he can do that. Then where is the child? That you will have to arrange for. I kept Rs 20000 with you. And you have misappropriated... ...Rs 10000 out of it! Don't say missappropriation, sir. I had given this sum to my ...relative for two days, to help him. Is that not theft. I don't want to hear this nonsense! Just give me two days. I pray to you. Why two days. I want my money by tomorrow. If you don't I will... ...hand you over to the police. I want my money by tomorrow... ...morning, understood! No, he will not do. Not even this one. This boy is too thin. His bones will break. This boy looks all right. Yes, how much will you take for him. I don't want to sell him. - I too don't want to buy... ...and pickle him. He has to work in the carnival. What work? It is a very interesting work. Every evening some 10 minutes... ...of work, and Rs. 20 earning. We will keep the child on the trunk of an elephant. For some... ...time he will play with the child. Then he will toss him... ...in the air Oh my god! Listen! After tossing him, he will catch him back and put him on.. ...The ground. No, I'll not give my child. Fool, he is a trained elephant. He loves children more than... a mother. No, no. On top you will get Rs. 20 per day. No, I'll not give my child. Then go from here, and continue to beg Listen to me! You want to put our children into danger? Lets go Just listen to me! You had said there would be no problem to arrange a child! How did I know they will kick fortune and go away like this! Problem. Tickets have been sold. Posters put in place! If I had known, I would have married a year and half back. We wouldn't have faced this problem. Manmauji, you are still playing the joker! With great difficulty I got the money, then the elephant and... ...after all this effort, for want of a child everything will go ...wastel For want of one child! Brother! What is it? You are sweating in winter also! Come with me, I will tell you. Is it an indoor issue. Come with me! I want my money and now or I lose my job and respect. He has warned me, if I don't return his money he will hand... ...me over to the police. But where can I get you the money now. I bought the ...elephant yesterday only. If you believe me take the... ...elephant to your owner and show it to him. This is no time to fool. If I don't pay, I will go to jail. What will happen to my family name? As if I am not bothered about your family name. It is now... ...a question of my sister's life also. But I am helpless. I cannot do anything. Idea! Your village is close by. Go there and get the money. There is no bank in the village. There is only land and a house. But isn't property wealth? And half of the property is now on... ...your name. Mortgage that and get the money. With what face can I go there. After marriage, I haven't seen Neelima and the child. Nor have... ...I sent any money. How can I mortgage the land and house now Ah yes, after coming from the village, two kids are born there One to Neelima and one in that lame ducks house. Sham, come to the Carnival at night and take the money. Radha, what has happened to Nlunna. He isn't keeping quiet. I wonder who has cast the evil eye. He keeps extending his... ...arms and looks towards me. Fire! Shankar, your fields are on fire! Uncle! What happened? - He says my fields are on fire. Our fields are on fire! Oh my god! Uncle! Father! He set the fields on fire! Beat him up! Halt! Why are you beating me. I only obeyed my masters orders. The fields are anyway burnt Now save your Nlunna. He has... ...plans to take your child to the carnival. Save him! What happened to Nlunna? Please help me, take me to the city. Come sister! Hey, where are you going? Out you go! My Child! Where are you going? - Let me go. My Nlunna is inside. Who Nlunna? My child. Ladies and Gentlemen. For the finale, we present to you a ...breath-taking spectacle. So hold your heart and see! Go and get the child! The Hero of this show is this Elephant, the King of the Forest. And the second hero is this young boy Rocky. Raja will hold Rocky in his trunk and toss him in the air! What happens next is what you must watch! What happened to my money! You will just get it? Will you drink this nectar? I want my money quickly. What happened to you? Nothing has happened to him. Give me the child. Leave my child! Your hand! Your legs! Saw my Singapuri hands. Now I will sort out both of you! Navrangi, what have you done? Haven't your eyes opened yet. He set fire to our fields. He stole... ...Nlunna and put him into the jaws of death. Still you ask ...this fool, 'Navrangi, what have you done?' Should I tell you, what all he hasn't done! Don't say anything also I am already ashamed. You satan, when you were born, surely a temple must have been... ...set on fire! May God send you to hell. Auntie, I am your family's last symbol on earth. If this symbol is removed from this earth, it will be better. So now sister is speaking. What all I did, was for you only. Those who do good are now being criticised! See, an educated person like me who was in Singapore, is being... ...sent to jail! And these cow dung pickers are out of jail. Bless me as I have made you hands & legs to work. Manmauji, have they handcuffed you before me. Ok. let us go! See Tau, my leg is all right, and so is my hand! Who is it who will make the first strike. That right is mine. No, Tau, I will break the first brick. Your Tai will break it! She only had erected this wall! Take this, Tai. Whatever God does is for the better. There is perhaps delay... ...in his court, but not darkness. Oh, we forgot, today is Janma shtami, birthday of our Lord! Truth and love will always prevail. Cruelty & evil will always be destroyed. Religion & morality will prevail for ages.
