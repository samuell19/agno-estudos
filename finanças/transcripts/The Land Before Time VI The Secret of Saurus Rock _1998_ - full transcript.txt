NARRATOR: Since the very beginning of our world, there have been wonderful stories about how life began. There are tales of how the Bright Circle gave birth to the lesser lights of the dark time, which watch over us as we sleep. And many ways of explaining (RUMBLING) how our world itself was formed. (THUNDER CRACKING) And how the first strange, incredible creatures came to walk upon the land. (SCREECHING) (SCREECHING) Which of the stories are really true, Grandpa? (LAUGHS) No one knows, Littlefoot. That is one of the great mysteries of life. Yeah, but... CERA: Shh! Littlefoot! Please! Do not interrupt! Yeah! Petrie not like it when you erupt neither! (GRANDPA CLEARS THROAT) GRANDPA: As I was saying, after many crossings of the Bright Circle, great herds began to appear on the land... The Longnecks, the Spiketails, the Threehorns. (GROANS) (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, Dana, Dinah. Hiya! Threebie hornas! Hush you two, or Auntie Cera's gonna be upset! Ooh! "Auntie Cera!" Well! (GIGGLES) Mmm! (CHUCKLES) All right, children. What happened then, Grandpa? Some of these herds, in their migrations across the land, found the most fertile, beautiful place in the world. CHILDREN: The Great Valley! GRANDPA: Yes. And life in the Great Valley was good, (EERILY) until one day, (DISTANT ROARING) the Sharptooth came! (ROARING) (ALL SCREAMING) (FOOTSTEPS THUDDING) GRANDPA: And not just any Sharptooth, but the biggest, meanest, most ferocious Sharptooth ever! (ROARING) (ALL SCREAMING) (GASPS) (STRAINING) YOUNG LONGNECK: Mama! (GASPS) (SCREAMS) (SHARPTOOTH GROWLING) GRANDPA: But then, just when the Longnecks thought all was lost, (THUDS) the Lone Dinosaur appeared on the horizon! PETRIE: The who? The what? The Lone Dinosaur! But what is a lone... Shh! (GASPS) GRANDPA: The battle seemed to last for hours. It was a spectacle no one had ever seen before! (GROWLING) A lone leaf-eater taking on a Sharptooth! (ROARS) (THUDS) (YELPS) GRANDPA: But then... (GROANS) (ROARS) (CRASHING) (YELPS) (BRANCHES CRACKING) (THUDDING) (ALL SHOUTING EXCITEDLY) YOUNG LONGNECK: Wait! Come back. Come back! (THUDDING) GRANDPA: And just as suddenly as he had appeared, the Lone Dinosaur went away. ALL: Oh! That's it? He just leave? Nobody ever saw him again? Well, legend has it that not long after the defeat of the Sharptooth... (RUMBLING) Earthshake! (GASPS) (PANTING) (THUDS) (SCREAMS) (ALL SCREAMING) (CRACKING) (SPARKING) ALL: Ooh! GRANDPA: So they called it "Saurus Rock." And it's there to this very day. Sometimes, when the wind is just right and blows away the mists, you can see it, watching over the Great Valley just like the Lone Dinosaur did so many years ago. They say if you look very closely you can see the circle of teeth around its neck. Real teeth? The story goes that they came from the very Sharptooth the Lone Dinosaur defeated. ALL: Whoa! (BOTH WHIMPERING) They say that some nights, you can see the ghost of that Sharptooth wandering around, looking for his teeth! (BOTH GASP) (ROARS) (BOTH YELP) (ALL LAUGH) Scary Dana... Dinah no no! BOTH: Uh-uh. (CHUCKLES) Well, I've never heard that part of the legend. But they do say that if anything ever happens to Saurus Rock, (EERILY) bad luck will descend upon the Great Valley. Is it all true, Grandpa? Well, (CHUCKLES) it's a grand adventure, and a really good story. And it is nice to think that somewhere out there is a Lone Dinosaur watching over us all. GRANDMA: Grandpa Longneck! Are you filling these children's heads full of nonsense, and just before bedtime? (STUTTERS) Why, uh, no, I was just... Yes, I know. But it's late. Time for little ones to be in the nest, (BOTH YAWN) resting for another day. (YAWNS) She right. Me pooped. Night, Littlefoot. Night, Petrie! Now, Spike, do not be scared to walk home in the dark. The Lone Dinosaur will protect us. He will! (MUMBLES) But just in case, you go first. Come on, you two. (SLEEPILY) No uppies. Dinah Dana, sleepy. (BOTH YAWN) (BOTH SIGH) Oh, all right. Hop on. (BOTH LAUGHING) (GROANS) Ow! Don't yank my horns! They're attached, you know! (LAUGHS) And now it's your turn, Littlefoot. (YAWNS) Yes, Grandma. I'm the Lone Dinosaur. I can find my way home in the dark all alone! (ANIMAL YELPING) Um, you coming? (SCREAMS) (ROARS) (GASPS) There he is! The Lone Dinosaur! (GASPS) LITTLEFOOT: (SWISHING) Hiya! (GROANS) (THUDDING) (SCOFFS) (ALL CHEERING) I wonder if it's really all true. (THUDDING) (ALL LAUGHING) BOTH: More tree stars! BOTH: More tree stars! (GRUNTS) (THUDS) Look, over here! Over here! (ALL CHEERING) What are you children doing? Oh! Hi, Daddy. Hello, sir. We were just, uh... Don't you kids realize this is the Time of the Changing Tree Stars? We can't waste those that haven't fallen yet! They must be eaten before they dry up. Do you want us to run out of food entirely? GRANDPA: Now, now. There's no need to frighten the young ones. (SCOFFS) Anyways, Cera, you should be watching the twins! Daddy, I am watching them! Oh, really? Then where are they? (BOTH SCREAM) (ALL GRUNT) (BOTH SCREAM) (BOTH LAUGHING) Right here. See? Oh! I knew those Longnecks should've been watching! Way to go! You almost got me in big trouble. Oh, Dana no no! Boohoo Dinah! (BOTH CRY) What we gonna do now? We do not want Cera's dad mad at us again! No, no, no! Hey, I got it! We can play "Lone Dinosaur"! Huh? How do you play? Well, one of us is the Lone Dinosaur, one of us is the Sharptooth, and the rest are the ones who get chased and saved! Who gets to be the Lone Dinosaur? Well, it was my idea. Then who's the Sharptooth? Well, it should be somebody who's pretty big and can act pretty mean. Me? BOTH: Cerrie! Cerrie! Cerrie! How come I have to be the bad guy? Well, you, uh, you're so good at pretend. 'Member how you scare twins last night? It scared me! It scared Spike, too! Right, Spike? (YAWNS) (MUMBLES) Then it's settled! (ROARS) (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL LAUGHING) (CERA ROARS) (KIDS SCREAM) Never... (CLEARS THROAT) (DEEPLY) Never fear! I'm coming! Mmm. Gotta make a big entrance. (GASPS) Perfect! (ALL SHOUTING CHEERFULLY) (CERA ROARING) Now I have you! No! Please, do not eat us, mean old Sharptooth! Oh, no, no, no! Yeah! (GIGGLES) Me too young to get ate. (DEEPLY) Stand back, big bad Sharptooth! Never fear! The Lone Dinosaur is... (SCREAMS) (ALL SCREAM) (GRUNTS) Whoa! Gee! Thanks! For a second there I thought I was... (GASPS) (STUTTERS) It's you. I mean, you're here! I mean, who are you? Name's Doc. What's going on here? Who is this? Are you bothering our kids? Daddy! No! Him save Littlefoot! Saved Littlefoot? Goodness! Are you all right, little one? Yes, Grandma. I was climbing on that rotten log, and I fell. Me see him! He fall very fast, 'cause he not flyer like me! And then this very big and very nice Longneck is there! And he caught him! Of course, we probably would've caught him, too. Well, wherever you came from, you have my thanks for saving my grandson. Welcome to the Great Valley! Welcome! Just passing through. Well, stay just as long as you want. Hold on there! We don't know anything about this fellow! Who is he? Where's his herd? Kind of a loner. CERA'S DAD: Mighty suspicious, if you ask me. I say send him on his way! You sure you feel up to it, friend? (STUTTERS) Well, I... That is... Uh, our life here is a sheltered one. Uh, perhaps we've forgotten how to greet unexpected guests. As Grandma said, you are welcome here. What's ours is yours. What? But it's the Time of the Changing Tree Stars! Every day, there's less food to go around. And Longnecks eat a lot! There's still plenty for all. (SCOFFS) Longnecks! Always stick together! (CERA'S DAD MUMBLES) (LAUGHS) Don't mind him. He's a good sort, once you get to know him. Don't know as I want to stay that long. (ALL SNICKERING) All right, children, run and play. Let's give our guest some peace. Littlefoot, come on! Hello, kid. Hi. Shouldn't you be with your little pals? I, uh, I just wanted to say thanks again for saving my life. Hmm, lucky catch. Um, hey! If you like tree stars, there's a big grove of them down... By the watering hole, past the tall grass. How'd you know? Been here before. (GASPS) Where'd you get that scar? Cut myself. On what? Something sharp. Like a tooth? A sharp tooth? Kid. I think I hear your friends calling. (STUTTERS) Yeah, me, too. Nice talking to you. Yup. Oh boy! (BUBBLING) (KIDS LAUGHING) (GASPS) Yuck! Hey! My skin feel softer already! Come on! Last one across is Sharptooth bait! (BOTH SNICKER) BOTH: Cerrie! (LAUGHING) Whoa! Watch out. Don't push Auntie... Uh-oh, Dinah! Uh-oh! Dana no no! Uh-oh! (ECHOING) Let me outta here! Help! Help! Help! (GASPS) Me coming! (POPS) (GASPS) (BOTH SNICKER) (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTS) (MUTTERS) (GROANS) (CHUCKLES) Hey! (HUMMING) (GASPS) DANA: Cerrie mad us? Smiley Cerrie? (GRUNTS) BOTH: Whoa! (BOTH LAUGHING) Leave me alone, you little pests. Get lost! (BOTH SOBBING) Cera! What? What? (BOTH GRUNT) Hey, guys, guess what? CERA: What? What? I just figured out who Doc is! What's the big mystery? He's a squinty-eyed old Longneck with no friends. Me could have tell you that. No! He's the Lone Dinosaur! That is what Cera said, he is a lone dinosaur. Not a lone dinosaur, the Lone Dinosaur! CERA: Are you crazy? You should talk to him! He's been to the Great Valley before, he's got this mysterious scar, he can do fancy tricks with his tail, and we know he's a hero, 'cause he saved me! Well, I've saved you lots of times. Does that make me the Lone Threehorn? (ALL LAUGH) Guys, I'm serious! Listen! (SINGING) (SINGING CONTINUES) (SINGING CONTINUES) (ALL LAUGHING) (SINGING CONTINUES) (SINGING STOPS) ALL: Yee-haw! (ALL SNICKERING) Well, hmm. Wow, the Lone Dinosaur! Right here! Wait a second! Your grandma said all that stuff about the Lone Dinosaur is just a story. That right. Me hear her. Well, I think it really happened! Even if it did, it couldn't have been Doc! That was a long, long, long time ago! The real Lone Dinosaur wouldn't still be alive. Would he? Me no know. I do not know, either. I do not. Well, I think he is alive, and he's right here in the Great Valley! I'll bet if you ever got a good look at Saurus Rock, you'd see it looks just like Doc! Dana... Rocky, go, go! Dinah! BOTH: Now! GRANDPA: Oh, Littlefoot! I've got to go. Listen, don't say anything about this to the grown-ups, okay? (WHISPERS) (SCOFFS) Don't worry. We don't want them to know you're nuts, too. GRANDPA: Littlefoot! Well, bye! Saurus Rock! (SCOFFS) (BOTH MUTTERING) (BOTH SNICKERING) (MIMICS DOC) You talking to me? You talking to me? Well, who are you talking to? You sure you feel up to it, friend? (SWISHING) Ow! (CHUCKLES) Time to settle down, Littlefoot. Uh, Grandpa, I was just, uh... I know. It's exciting to meet someone new and different. And you'll have plenty of time to get to know him better. But for now, it's time for some rest. Yes, Grandpa. (YAWNS) Night. Mmm. (CHUCKLES) Huh? What? Cera? Have you seen them? Are they here? Please say they're here! Huh? Who? The twins! Mmm. No, they're not here. Oh, no! They've disappeared! Dinah! Dana! (ECHOES) Kids! (GRUNTS) Yoo-hoo! Ah! (CRACKING) (SNORING) Hello, twins, are you in there? (GRUNTING) Uh-oh. (STUTTERS) Sorry, Mrs. Maia. I... Whoa! (GRUNTS) Oh! Now I am really sorry. Yep, yep, yep. This is terrible! I'm gonna be in so much trouble! I was in charge of them! (GRUNTING) Cera, calm down! We'll find them! Yes, they cannot be too far away. Let's think about this. When was the last time you saw them? Let's see. Yesterday by the bubbling goo. They pushed me in, I got mad. I told them to get lost! Huh! That right! She said that! Me heard her! Who knew they even knew what that means? Then what happened? Then you showed up, and started talking about Doc and the Lone Dinosaur, and what Saurus Rock must look like, and... ALL: Saurus Rock! (TWINS CHUCKLING) Sorry Rocky! Go, go, us! (BOTH STRAIN) (GASPS) (WEAKLY) And I remember the day Dinah said her first words. Or was it Dana? (SNIFFS) "Shiny peep-eye no no." Whatever that means. It is simple. That means, "The Bright Circle is shining in my eyes "and it hurts." How'd you know that? I am also a twin. Thirteen of us hatched at the same time. Thirteen twins! Come on, you guys. We've got a long way to go. CERA: So then what does "No no Grampy Threebie grr" mean? DUCKY: That means "Never make Grandpa Threehorn mad!" CERA: Are you sure about that one? DUCKY: No. But it is good advice, just the same. (WIND WHOOSHING) BOTH: Ooh! (ECHOING) Ah! (LAUGHING) (GRUNTS) (GASPING) (GIGGLES) (ALL GRUNTING) They're out there somewhere. So little, and tired, and scared. Whoo! (BOTH GIGGLING) (THUDDING) (SNIFFING) (GROWLING) (GROANS) Oh, no! The twins could never get across there. Wait! Remember the bubbling brown goo? Whoa! Maybe they hopped across the big ditch. Yep, yep, yep! (GRUNTS) It's not hard. Come on, Cera! (GROANS) The things I do for family. (GRUNTS) (SHAKILY) Whoa! Hey, this is kind of fun! Let's go, Spike. Me right there with you! (GASPS) (MUMBLING) You can do it. Just no look down. (STRAINS) Spike! No! (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) No look down, but look at something! (GASPS) (WHIMPERS) (GRUNTS) Not bad for first try. You can do it, Spike! Come on, Spike! Wait for Petrie! (THUDDING) (RUMBLING) Oh. Me guess we take the long way home. LITTLEFOOT: Whoa! Not even Grandpa could reach those tree stars! My dad could. How? The Threehorn way. He'd just knock it right over. One of these trees? I don't think so! Oh, yeah? Watch this! (GRUNTS) Uh, nice one. Me convinced. That sure didn't feel like a tree trunk. It no look like tree trunk either. (GROWLING) And it does not sound like a tree trunk. No, no... No! (ALL SCREAMING) It is not a tree trunk! (ALLOSAURUS ROARS) (ALL SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (THUDS) (ALL PANTING) I think we lost him. (GASPS) (ALL GASP) Saurus Rock does look like Doc! Sort of. Maybe. A little. (GASPS) And there's the twins! (ECHOING) Dinah! Dana! Thank goodness you're okay! BOTH: Huh? Huh? Cerrie! Looka whee! Us uppie! BOTH: Uppie! What'd they say? They say look at them, they are high up on the top. Yeah! So be careful! (BOTH GIGGLING) CERA: Look out! Hold on! We're coming! (ALL STRAINING) Roll other way. Roll other way! (STRAINS) Hang on, twins, I'm almost there! (GASPS) (BOTH GIGGLING) (BOTH SCREAM) (STRAINS) (CRACKING) (ALL SCREAMING) (THUDDING) (MUMBLING) (RUMBLING) Uh-oh. Oops! Oops! (SOBBING) Sad us, Cerrie. Dana, Dinah, no no. It's okay. It's not your fault Saurus Rock got broken. It's yours! (GASPS) Me! What'd I do? If you hadn't been talking about Saurus Rock, Dinah and Dana wouldn't have run away in the first place! Cerrie say so. Bye. We bye-bye. What did the little dears say? They said you are the one who told them to get lost. (ALL LAUGHING) I'm also the one who won't come and save you the next time, if you run away again! Got it? Uh-huh. Yeah. And not a word about this to Grandpa Threehorn. BOTH: Uh-uh! No! 'Cause you don't want to see Grandpa Threehorn when he's mad! When Grandpa Threehorn gets mad, it's even scarier than... Than... A Sharptooth! No, I think a Sharptooth's a little bit scarier. Maybe. (WEAKLY) No, no, Cera! Really, behind you! Oh, Come on. Don't try that old gag on me. (MUTTERS) (GROWLING) Okay, Ducky, nice try! You almost sound like a Sharptooth! Hey, is it starting to rain? Argh! Sharptooth drool! (ALL SCREAMING) (ROARS) (PANTING) Yuck! It spit on me! (WHIMPERS) It pick its teeth with you if you no hurry! (ALL SCREAMING) This way! (THUDDING) Hey, everybody, in here! DUCKY: Cera, it is a good thing that Sharpteeth are not very smart. PETRIE: It dark in here. DUCKY: (GRUNTS) Spike, do not poke me! LITTLEFOOT: Shh! Quiet! DUCKY: Hey, what is this? (SCREAMS) (ROARS) (ALL SCREAMING) Whoa! CERA: Oh, great. Where are we now? PETRIE: Me no know, but it sure still dark in here. DUCKY: Maybe we are in his tummy. TWINS: (MIMIC VOMITING) Yuckie! (STRAINS) (GRUNTS) It no look like tummy. Me no see Sharptooth at all. Hey! No problem! You guys can walk right 'cross big ditch! (STRAINS) He's right. Let's go! Dinah, Dana, come on! (STRAINS) BOTH: Whoa! Pay attention! We're going that way! (BOTH GIGGLING) CERA: Move it! (SCREAMS) I do not like this, no, no, no. No worry! You swimmer, right? Mmm-hmm. If you fall, there a skinny little river way down there that you might land in! Maybe. Oh, thank you. I feel much better now. (STRAINS) Okay, Spike, let's go! (STRAINS) LITTLEFOOT: That's it. Atta boy. What's the matter? You're not stuck, are you? (STRETCHING) (GROWLING) (ROARS) You don't know how sorry I am to hear that. Come on, Spike! Move! (STRAINS) (BOTH STRAIN) (GASPS) (ROARS) (ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Come on! (ROARS) (SCREAMING) (ALLOSAURUS ROARING) (THUDDING) Whoa! CERA: (SIGHS) What a day! I thought we'd never get home. Hey, we got the twins back. And your dad never even knew they ran away. Ran away? (STUTTERS) Hi, Daddy. What did he mean, Cera? Did the twins really run away? Well, sort of, for a little while, but they didn't go far. Ussie go, go. Sorry Rocky! They said they went to Saurus Rock. Saurus Rock? Cera! It was your duty to watch the twins and you failed. Yes, Daddy. I am very disappointed in you! Now march yourself right home! Apparently, you still need to be watched yourself! Losing the twins! I never heard of such a thing! It's absurd! Me and my big mouth. Do not feel bad, Littlefoot. It not your fault. Just bad luck. DUCKY: Just like your Grandpa said it would be, if anything happened to Saurus Rock. First we have bad luck. Then the whole Great Valley will have bad luck. Then maybe the whole dinosaur world will have bad luck. Then maybe even the whole universe will have bad luck. Gosh! She's right. Bad luck. (STRAINS) (SCREAMS) (GASPS) (PANTING) Littlefoot, are you all right? Just a bad dream. Well, it's all over now. Try to get back to sleep. Grandpa? Mmm? What if something happened to Saurus Rock? What do you mean? Something bad. Like, it broke, or somebody broke it or something. As I told you, the legend says bad luck would descend upon the Great Valley. (CHUCKLES) But no time for stories tonight. Sleep now, little one. PETRIE: Just bad luck. DUCKY: Like your Grandpa said, (ECHOING) the whole Great Valley. GRANDPA: Bad luck! DUCKY: Then the whole dinosaur world! PETRIE: (EERILY) Bad luck! GRANDPA: (EERILY) Bad luck! Bad luck? Yeah. Just like you said. Ever since we came back from Saurus Rock. (LAUGHING) Me just say that. Me no believe in bad luck! Huh? Ducky! What happened to your beak? I got it stuck in a hive of buzzing stingers. What about Spike's tail? Same thing. You don't call that bad luck? Nah. Could happen to anybody. Whoa! (GROANS) Huh? (BEES BUZZING) (SCREAMS) Do not worry, Littlefoot. What is a little bad luck? (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING) (ALL SCREAM) (SINGING CONTINUES) (SINGING STOPS) What do you think, Cera? The only bad luck I ever had was having to watch those crazy twins. And now my dad treats me like a baby. Cerrie! Cerrie! Grampy Threebie! Now! Yoohoo go, go! Now! Uh, your dad wants you home. See what I mean? They're in charge of me! Whoa! (GIGGLES) It's just like Grandpa said, if something happens to Saurus Rock, bad luck descends on the Valley. Maybe. But so far we the only ones having bad luck. Yeah, but what if it starts happening to everybody? It'll be our fault! This is serious, Longneck. What could make the watering place dry up like this? Hmm. Perhaps the last earthshake moved it under the ground. This is horrible. Oh! (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Please, Please, everyone. Calm down. There is still plenty of water in the Great Valley. Yes, but this watering place was the coolest and the clearest. Oh, why did it have to be the one that dried up? Very bad luck, if you ask me. (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (GASPING) (RUSTLING) Hi, Doc. Mind if I hang around? Suit yourself. (MUNCHING) Hey, Doc. You believe in bad luck? Seen too much of it not to. Say you're having a lot of bad luck... What can you do about it? Change what you can, accept what you can't. You can change luck? Really? How? If there's a problem, try to fix it. If you can't, sometimes you just have to move on. Oh. But what if... What if you don't want to move on? Then you're asking the wrong Longneck, kid. I'm a loner. That's the way I've always lived. This valley's nice. But there are others just as nice out there somewhere. I've always done it my way... Moving on, looking for someplace a little better. Don't you ever get lonesome? Sometimes. Sometimes I feel a bit crowded too. My footsteps were planted on the wandering trail long ago. I'm too old to change now. (MOANS) (CHUCKLING) (SQUEALING) Whoa! Whoa! (CHUCKLING) Whoa! Whoa! What's going on? I don't know. We should find our folks. Oh, dear... I don't like the looks of this. The children. Find the children. GRANDPA: Littlefoot! Littlefoot! Cera! Cera! Oh, no! Where are the twins? (WHIMPERING) Hurry, little ones. (WIND WHOOSHING) Littlefoot! Where are you, Grandpa? (STRAINING) Hang on! Auntie Cera's here. Littlefoot! Where are you? Cera! CERA: Daddy! CERA'S DAD: Cera... (GASPS) Hang on, kid. Keep your head down! Littlefoot! Oh! It's... It's over. Littlefoot. (RUSTLING) Grandpa? Oh, Littlefoot. He saved me! Doc saved me! Again! Then I thank you. Again. Ah... Lucky break. Grandpa! Littlefoot! Thank goodness you're both safe. Me never see swirling wind like that before. Oh, no, no, no. Cerrie ussie blowie no no! Whoosh! (CHUCKLING) Yes. It is good that Cera didn't let you blow away. Cera? I'm very proud of you. GRANDPA: Oh... Just look at our beautiful valley. Well... Looking at it won't get it cleaned up. (ALL GROANING) (BOTH GRUNTING) (BOTH SIGHING) Mighty strange the way things have been happening lately. Take this storm, for instance. We've had whirling winds before. They're just part of the circle of life. I know, but... It seems to me that we've suffered more than our share of misfortunes since a certain stranger came to the Valley. (GROANING) GRANDPA: Now, Mr. Threehorn... I agree with Threehorn here. Life was good in this valley, just fine. And then he shows up and everything falls apart. That's right! GROWN-UP: Our luck has turned. GROWN-UP 2: It's the stranger's fault. GROWN-UP 3: He's bad luck. Please, everyone. You're being unfair. Understand me, Longneck. I'm not saying anything against the fellow. He may be quite fine in his own way. Apparently he saved your boy, and... That's right! He did! Littlefoot... Doc did save my life! He's a real live hero. The only one I ever met! Calm down, son. I merely meant that... Doc is the bravest and... And... And the best Longneck that ever was. I never said he wasn't, Littlefoot. All I said was that he brought bad luck to the Valley. He didn't! He didn't! All right, Littlefoot. All right. Shh. (LITTLEFOOT PANTING) See here, Longneck. I, uh, didn't mean to make the boy... I know. I know. We're all a bit upset. I suggest we discuss these matters later. For now, it's best if we all pitch in. (ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY) Littlefoot? You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. All the bad luck... It's not his fault. Yes, it is. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. No, it isn't. Well, I agree with my dad. I think Doc did cause all the bad luck. We know who caused the bad luck, Cera, and it wasn't Doc. It was us. Look, I never liked the guy much, okay? And I'm not even sure I believe in this bad luck stuff. But if the grown-ups want to blame him, why not let 'em? 'Cause it's not fair! They're gonna end up chasing him away. And I don't want him to go. Well, there's nothing you can do about it, anyway. Yes, there is. I can fix it. (SPITS) What? I'm not gonna let Doc take the blame for all this. If they won't help me, I'll just have to do what a lone dinosaur would do. Go off by myself and change what I can. Maybe I can change our luck. Why you say that, Cera? I didn't mean to make him mad, but... Hey, my dad's happy with me again. I'd be crazy to let him find out we caused all this lousy luck. I thought you did not believe in bad luck. Do you? I do not know. Hmm... (GRUNTS) (CRASHING) (ALL SCREAMING) (ALL WHIMPERING) Petrie believe. Bad luck real. Well... Maybe I believe it. If it is bad luck, Littlefoot is right. We did cause it. Yep, yep, yep. Well, then, we'll just have to fix it. We? Who needs them, anyway? I'm a lone dinosaur. I don't need anybody. Gee. I wonder if all the other lone dinosaurs talk out loud to themselves like this? They must. It would be too quiet. (SINGING) (SINGING STOPS) Littlefoot! Hey, Littlefoot. Where'd you go? Me no find him anywhere. No see ussie. Dinah Dana. BOTH: Huh-uh! What was it he said, right before he left? Littlefoot say he gonna fix it. Fix what? Uh, the bad luck, I guess. Yes, but how? Well... He said we caused it when we broke the Sharptooth's tooth off Saurus Rock. (GASPS) Uh-oh. You kids better wait with Grandpa Threehorn. We've got something we need to do. Let's see. Now where... There he is! Right where he landed. Just one tooth... (GASPS) That's all I need. (GROANS) If I can get it back on Saurus Rock, all the bad luck will end. Whoa! (PANTING) And Doc can stay. So that's it? You're leaving? You don't have to go. Nobody really blames you for these... Misfortunes. Such things are just part of the circle of life. I'd be moving on, anyway. Now is as good a time as any. No need to cause trouble. Littlefoot will miss you. He's a good kid. Well. Better get started while the Bright Circle's high. You're always welcome if you happen to be heading this way again. Much obliged. KIDS: Grandpa Longneck! Grandpa Longneck! What is it, children? Where's Littlefoot? (GULPS) (GASPS) Sure looks dead. (SNIFFING) Sure smells dead. Come on. You can do this. What's the big deal? It's just a big, dead Sharptooth. Might as well be a pile of dirt. A big, smelly pile of dirt. With... Big, sharp teeth inside. Hmm... I'm gonna need a stick or something to get his mouth open. (SNARLS) (GROANING) Oh... Now which way? (PANTING) You mean you don't know the way to Saurus Rock? GRANDPA: To tell you the truth, I've never gone there. But you knew so much about it. What it looked like, and how it got there and everything. You did, you did. Yep, yep, yep. Oh, well... Those were stories my grandpa told me when I was a youngster. (PANTING) Whew! Oh... And right now I wish I'd never told them to you kids. (STRAINING) Ew... I better just pick one and get out of here. I don't know how long that stick will hold. That looks like a good one. (STRAINING) (GRUNTS) It's stuck in there pretty tight. (GRUNTING CONTINUES) I can do this. Whew! Good thing there's a breeze in here. Wait a second. I'm inside a dead Sharptooth. Why would there be a breeze? Unless it's... Breathing. But if it's breathing, then that means... (SCREAMING) It's alive! (ROARING) (GROANS) (SHARPTOOTH GROWLING) (GASPS) (ROARS) (SCREAMS) (PANTING) Gee! I wonder if I lost... Help! I don't want to be a lone dinosaur anymore! (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GROANS) (GROWLING) Doc? Grandpa! Run, Littlefoot! (PANTING) You came for me. Don't we always? You sure do. I just hope Grandpa will be all right. (ALL CHEERING) Come on, Grandpa go! Oh! He doing okay. Until now... (ROARING) (THUDDING) (GROANS) Grandpa! Me no look! I gotta help him. LITTLEFOOT: Doc! (THUDDING) Oh! You sure have a habit of showing up at the right time. Still just lucky, I guess. (CRASHING) GRANDPA: It's a good thing Sharpteeth aren't very smart. (RUMBLING) (ALL CHEERING) Yay, Doc! Hurray! (GASPS) (CHEERING CONTINUES) LITTLEFOOT: Doc, Doc! You don't have to leave. The time of bad luck's almost over. It's just time I was going, kid. Yeah, but... This herd life's not for me. Too much talking. Well... Be seein' ya, kid. Okay, Doc. And thanks. Good luck, kid. Doc! Don't go too far. You never know when we might need... A hero. You already got a hero, kid. How's that look, Grandpa? (CHUCKLING) It looks wonderful, Littlefoot. LITTLEFOOT: Now maybe the time of bad luck will finally be over. GRANDPA: Oh, Littlefoot, I told you. That was all just a bedtime story. There's no... I know, I know. There's no such thing as bad luck. But there's no harm in making sure. I suppose not. Let's go home. Grandpa? Yes, Littlefoot? Thanks for being my hero. (CHUCKLING) CERA: There was no place to hide. All seemed lost for the leaf-eaters. That terrible Sharptooth had them cornered. His massive teeth dripped blood as he threw his head back and roared. (ROARING) But then... Just when there seemed to be no escape... Suddenly... Oh, let me tell this part. Oh, okay. Just when there seemed to be no escape, suddenly the leaf-eaters looked on the horizon. LITTLEFOOT: And there stood... The Great Dinosaur! He stared at the Sharptooth. ALL: Whoa! Then he whipped his tail forward... NARRATOR: And so, another myth was born. It would change with each re-telling. And even now... Who knows where this one will end?
