How do you do, Senator? Fine, Penelope, fine, and you look very grown-up tonight. So do you, Senator. - Hopeless. - Sap. Everybody knows senators are grown up. Well, that isn't what Daddy says. How do you do, Mrs... How do you do, Mrs. K... Those Kittenheavens, they're the worst ones. Kittenhaven, Penny, not -heaven. Just think of, "How are your kittens behavin'?" Kittenhaven, see? How do you do, Mrs. Kittenhaven? Oh, my dear child, I'm quite well again, thank you. Oh, we thought you were dead. Now, Penny. Well, we did until she got better and fooled everybody. - But you don't go around telling people... - All right, all right, then I'll just smile. - Right. - Right. Evening, Penelope. We haven't been to South Carolina since then, but we often talk about the wonderful time we had with you and Mr. Kittenhaven. So have we, and you know, I still have the table we stole at the auction! And... oh, now don't tell me those three lovely girls are Joan and Kay and little Penny. Yes, they don't look much like the three little rascals that played Indian all over your house that winter, do they? - Where's Daddy? - He's still at the office. I want you to meet an old friend. You remember my daughters. - How do you do? - Hello. I bet you don't remember me, Penelope. Oh, yes, I do. How do you do, Mrs. Kittenha... - Kitten... - Haven. Oh, yes, of course. "How are your kittens behavin'?" - Your what? - Oh, I mean, how... How is your health behaving? Oh, my dear child, I'm quite well again, thank you. We thought you were... ouch! - Oh, did you hurt yourself, my dear? - No, it was Joan, she... Oh, excuse me, there's Richard. Hello, Richard. I thought for a while you girls weren't coming to your own party. We've been rehearsing Penny. We had to dress her and fix her hair ten times. She's over there still making five faux pas a minute. - Where's Kay? - With Mother, talking to some very dull people. I'd better go over and say hello to her. - Hello, Kay. - Hello, Richard. - Hi, Rich. - Hi, Penny. Lucy, you know Richard Watkins, don't you? Indeed I do. I suppose anybody who's ever been in Boston knows the Watkins family. Hey, Lucy, come over here. Excuse me. I thought you'd be waiting for us at the foot of the stairs. Instead of standing around like a bird in the wilderness. Hey, you girls had better be nice to me. - I'm going to leave town in the morning. - Leave? - Where are you going, Richard? - To Boston. I can't help it, it's a family pow-wow. - Do you have to go? - I'm afraid so. Some families flock together for funerals, and the Watkins gather when the board of directors meet. Hello, Joan! Hello, Kay! - Hello. - Hello. You won't be gone long? Only a couple of weeks, and maybe less than that. Maybe you can sneak back next weekend. Mother, did you call Daddy's office again? Yes, they said he left just ten minutes ago. - Hello, Penny. - Oh, good evening, Senator. My, what a lovely picture, mother and daughter. I, uh, I look very grown-up tonight, don't I, Senator? Oh, I wouldn't say that. You're still just a little girl to me. - Oh, really? - Remember when I used to dandle you on my knee? - No, I don't, I'm sorry. - Well, that's not so very long ago. Oh, there's Daddy. Excuse me. I beg your pardon. Good evening, sir. Mrs. Craig has been asking for you every five minutes, sir. Has she? Tell her I'll be home right away. Oh, hang this up. - Daddy! - Hello, darling! - Oh, I thought you'd never get home! - So did I. - Hello, Judson! - Oh, hello! How are you? - Who is he? - Now, Daddy... Who are all these people? Did they drop in this evening? Oh, Daddy, you've forgotten about the party, my party. Oh, for goodness' sake, no, I thought the party was Wednesday. But this is Wednesday, Daddy. Well, you told me yesterday it was tomorrow. This is tomorrow, Daddy. You're working too hard. You haven't even noticed my new dress. Oh, let me get a look at it. Let me look at you! Well, now, that is... That is astonishing. Nice? Lovely, simply lovely. Who's your boyfriend tonight? Same one: You. - Hello, Dorothy. - Hello, Judson. I had to straighten out a situation in Paris. Waited hours to get a call through. - Hello, Baxter! - Hello, Judson, how'd they close? All markets strong, London and Paris up. - Hello, Freddie! - Well, a late Judson Craig! - Your coat, sir. - What? - Your coat. - What's the matter with it? Oh! Come on, Penny, let's go in and see who else is here. Judson, I think you'd better go upstairs and get dressed first. What? Oh, you mean the trimmings, yes. - Oh, hello, Victor, how are you? - Swell. How's the Wizard of Wall Street? None of that wizard stuff! You know, he clipped me last week... Now, Daddy, please, no more business tonight. Oh, all right. I'll be back exactly, let me see, at 1:37. How do you do? No, no, that's London time! Well, I'll be back in two shakes of a lamb's tail looking like a sheep in wolf's clothes. May I have the honor of this waltz, Penelope? Oh... certainly, Uncle Joe. Excuse us. This is really beautiful music. - Oh, it's my favorite. - Been mine for 40 years. In those days, "swing" meant a contrivance ya hung in a tree. That's very pretty, Penny. My heart's debonair. There's love in the air. Life is carefree. Our waltz will invite. Bright midsummer night. Are there any words to that? So on with the dance. Well, then, let's all hear them. All right. Night brings gay dreams. Gone are day dreams. While we dance. All the world becomes. A garden of romance and moonlight. On this June night. Love sends an invitation to the dance. At love's call. One and all are captured and enraptured. Love sends an invitation to the dance. Music playing. While we're swaying. Youth has a gay time. When life is May time. Then comes a day. When it fades away. These magic hours of moonlight. And flowers are flying on. They'll soon be gone. Now's a chance for sweet romance. She's just like her father. You should've heard me sing when I was younger. Yes, and we did, Judson. Don't forget we were your roommates at college. Oh, now, wait, you can't say anything... Judson is the most absent-minded man in the world, he forgets everything. Oh, now, that's not true, darling. People think when I'm concentrating, I don't know what's going on. I know everything I do and everything I say. I can remember things that happened back in... Back in, uh... Back in a minute. Mother, have you seen Joan? No, I haven't, dear. Oh, Katherine, would you mind terribly if we had this dance? No, not at all, Clarence. All right. - Some of the roast beef, please. - Beef, quite rare. Penny Craig, where do you think you're going to put all this food? Oh, I'm not gonna put it anywhere, I'm going to eat it. - How's the pheasant? - Most delicious, Miss Penny. Oh, good, I'll have some pheasant, but you know, I haven't had a bite to eat since 7 o'clock. Why, I always thought great artists didn't care about food and practically starved for their art. Oh, not great opera singers. Oh, if you think that, you just take a good look at the next one you see. - Some of these little fishes. - Anchovies. Joe, just the man I wanted to see. - Hello, Penny. - Hello. - My dear, your song was just darling. - Thank you. Well, go ahead, Penny. Enjoy yourself. - See you later. - Thanks for the dance! Would you bring that right over to this table, please? Certainly, Miss Penny. Oh, we forgot the salad. - Oh, is it good? - It's very nice. It has strips of chicken and bacon in it. Oh, we'll get that later. - Hello, Penny. - Good evening, Mr. Sharp. A nice glass of milk, Miss Penny? Well, just a little one. Just a little one. - Penny, where's Mother? - I don't know. Fine thing walking out on me while I'm singing. We had to do that, Penny. You can't ask a girl to marry you in front of a lot of people. We're engaged! Come on, Richard. Engaged? Oh, watch that for me and don't let anybody touch it. I brought you some salad too. Oh, uh, well, bring it all along. They're engaged. Yes. Oh, Kay, have you heard the news? Joan and Richard are engaged! They're engaged. Well, I think that's... What's the matter, Katherine? - You look so funny. - Oh, nothing, nothing. I just want to congratulate them. - My sister Joan is engaged! - Engaged? Uh-huh, to Richard Watkins. Excuse me, I have to tell the other people. It's such a surprise, Joan, but a very pleasant one. May I kiss you, too, Richard? Joan, dear. Penny just told me. Isn't it the most marvelous thing you've ever heard? It all happened so suddenly, really it did. My sister Joan is going to marry Richard Watkins! No, really? I'll tell the family about it tomorrow when I get to Boston. - Oh, that's fine. - Congratulations, Richard. - Congratulations, Dorothy. - Thank you, dear. - You should be very happy. - I am. Richard is a very fine boy. - Congratulations, Judson! - Thank you, thank you very much. - Great news, Mr. Craig, congratulations! - Certainly is. - Oh, Mr. Craig, we're all so thrilled! - So am I. - Congratulations, Judson. - Thank you. Binns, is this my birthday? No, sir, the congratulations are on behalf of Miss Joan's engagement to Mr. Watkins. Oh, I see. What, really? Binns! Oh, Daddy, isn't it grand? They're going to be married, and the wedding's gonna be wonderful, and I'm gonna sing and everything. Well, where is that fellow, that Watkins? - Here, sir. - Well, well, well, I turn my back for a few moments and look what happens. Well, young man, I don't know what to say, but I'm very pleased and I'm very proud. - Thank you. - And now for the lucky girl. Well, my dear girl, I hope you'll be very happy, I know you will. Daddy, it's Joan that's getting married. Oh, I'm sorry, Joan! Out of the millions and millions of girls in the world, why did Richard pick on me? I don't know, but the Craigs have always been lucky. Do you remember when I had to go to the hospital to have my tonsils out? That's where we met Richard. I swear I'm covered with goosebumps the size of doorknobs. I left the shower running, it's still like ice water. Tonight I say goodbye to my youth. Just think of it, I'm engaged. My trough planted, my destiny set. Oh... What's the matter? I hope the papers use a good picture of me, not that old one. You better get undressed, it's late. Ow! Well, you don't have to pull my hair out, do ya? Sorry, Mouse. Oh, I feel as if I could stay up all night. Well, I can't. Have to be at music school at 9:30 in the morning. Bet my voice will be terrible. Penny, I'll never forget tonight as long as I live. I'm the happiest girl in the world. You ought to be. What did he say? - Richard? - Yes. When he said, "Be mine," or whatever he said. It wasn't what he said, it was the way he looked at me when he said it. Oh, how'd he look at you? Like this? No, it... it was rather like this. Wonderful. As if we'd met after a long journey through the ages, as if we'd just found each other in some silent, lonely grove on a mountaintop. It was sort of... sort of cataclysmic. Sort of what? Cataclysmic. Oh. What's that? Cataclysmic? Why, it's when somebody... Well, you know, it's when somebody does the... Cataclysmic is... Well, anyway, he made the world and everyone else in it cease to exist. He filled the night with fire and song and wind. He did all that out there on the balcony? The night was full of glowing romance and ecstatic sound. That was me singing. Mrs. Richard M. Watkins. What's the M for, Mike? Mortimer. Mortim... Mortimer? Is that his middle name? It's such a brave name. Maybe he can change it. If he can't, I hope nobody will ever find out about it. I've never heard of anybody called Mortimer before. Mortimer... How do you like the name of Mortimer, Kay? Kay... - What's wrong, Kay? - Oh, nothing. - I'm just tired, that's all. - That's not all. - You're unhappy. - No, I'm not. Oh, yes, you are. Maybe I am. Why? I don't know, Penny. But you can't go around being unhappy just because you're unhappy, unless you're a Russian. - Who's a Russian? - Nobody. - She is. - I'm not! She's unhappy for no reason at all, and that's as Russian as caviar. If she's unhappy, there's a good reason for it. Isn't there, Kay? It's just Penny's imagination. It is not, you told me so yourself. - No, I... - What is it, Kay? Well, I... I was just thinking about us. All of us, that's it. You know, we've always been together. The three Craig sisters. And now there will only be you two. Yes. I think that's swell! Now we won't have to wait in line for the shower anymore. And I'll get a chance to drive the car once in a while. Right! We'll move that bed out of here and put our desk right there. - Right, and I get all her books. - Right! - But I'm not gone yet. - You keep out of this! - Right, you're only the victim. - Right! Why, it's ghoulish dividing up things before I'm out of the house. I'm not even married, yet! Well, hurry up! We're all set here, aren't we, Kay? - Right. - You can't do that. Here comes the bride, here comes the bride. Here comes the bride. Stop yelling, you'll wake up the house. You'll have Daddy up here in a minute. Take that! - Stop it! - Stop it! Stop it, I give up. - She gives up. - She better. Problem with both of you is, you don't appreciate a great voice. Just because I'm a relative. Mortimer... Good night. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Night. Penny? Penny, are you awake? One, one and a half... - Daddy. - Coming, coming, coming, coming. 1959, 1960. My car outside, Binns? - Yes, sir. - Bring it in. May I talk to you for just a minute, please, Daddy? Hello, darling. Get my office on the phone. - Yes, sir. - 187,000. Ridiculous. - Did you sleep well, darling? - No, I didn't sleep at all last night, Dad. That's fine, nothing like having a good night's sleep to start the day off right. Please listen to me for just a second, will you, Daddy? Just as soon as I tell the office about these trades. Hurry up, Binns. This cable arrived from Geneva. European quotations are all off balance this morning. - Here you are, sir. - All right, sir. I mean, Binns. Goodbye, darling. Goodbye, dear. Get my hat and coat. - You've get them on, sir. - Right. McIntyre? Craig. My empire, fourth and half. 1959, at 101 and a half, and keep on buying till they pass 102. Sell national four and a halfs of 1960, at 105 and keep on selling till I get there or until they get down to 102. Right. Oh, yes, yes, darling. What were we talking about? It's... well, it's about Kay, Daddy. She's... she's been crying all night. It's Richard, you see, she's in love with him too. She's awfully unhappy. I don't like to see her unhappy, and I know you don't want to see her unhappy, and, well, if we could only help her. I forgot to tell them at the office! Well, I can tell them when I get to the office. No, I better do it... Oh... if I can... Goodbye, darling. I'll explain all these things to you some other time. No, I better go now. It will all work out all right, Miss Penny. Binns, you didn't listen. I couldn't help hearing, Miss Penny, but I wouldn't worry about the matter too much. I have to worry about it, Binns. My sister Kay doesn't cry easily. When she cries, she means it. I know that, Miss Penny, but some other chap will come along, he'll dry Miss Kay's tears. It's been happening that way for centuries, you know. Somehow, someday, there'll be somebody, tall, dark, and handsome, and he'll make Miss Kay forget Mr. Richard like that. - You think so, Binns? - I know so, Miss Penny. Tall, dark, and handsome. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Hello. - Hello. - Nice day. - Nice day. - How do you do, Miss Craig? - How do you do, Miss Craig? I'm so sorry. - Maximilian! - Sheila! Oh, honey, you know what the professor just told me? No, sweetie, just what did he say? You're a little late this morning, aren't we? Oh, that's all right, I'm late too. You too? I'm not late. I stand here and I wait and I wait. Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said that you were late. Ah, you thought? I'll do the thinking. When you are teaching, you can do the thinking. Oh, how are your E's this morning? Well, I did vocalize a little. Oh, I know, in the bath tub, but that's not enough. Now we go over this exercise. Remember when a singer sings an E, every tooth, then you must sing. Now... See? See? - Hello, fellas. - Hello. - Oh, hello, Miss Craig. - Did you bring that Mozart score with you? I told my wife I knew I was forgetting something. She said I'd forgotten to kiss her and the kids goodbye. Miss Craig. I mean, haven't we... Oh, I'm sorry. When you have a lesson, then you have to listen to the lesson. When you have no lesson, then you have to listen to no lesson. He's married. - Who? - Everybody. They're either married or else they have a girlfriend or something. Miss Craig, I think we are a little too young to worry about getting a boyfriend. - Oh, but I... - Now I think we forget all this humbug and we start where we come in, now... You see, it's quite simple. Now, please, you try it. Please. Mr. Loren, this rehearsal was set for 9:30 sharp. Well, I'm sorry, I didn't get to bed until 4:00. - Hello, Harry. - Oh, hi, Penny old girl. Say, when are you gonna stop playing in those nightclubs? When I can overcome the awkward habit of eating. Dreamer. How are you getting along with the mad Russian this morning? I'm not Russian, I'm Polish. I'm not mad, but I'm going to be. Just one minute. How's your girlfriend, Harry? Girlfriend? I haven't any, I'm waiting for you to grow up. Now, Miss Craig, enough is already too much. - Yes, sir. - I never saw you like this. I mean, girlfriends, boyfriends, you have to study... Let the soprano do the schmearing. Do you mind if I sing it with you? - Do you know it? - Certainly. - No, no, she does not. - Yes, I do. - Oh, let her sing it. - Yeah! All right, I'd sing it myself just to get this rehearsal started. - Please, don't forget your E's. - I won't. Say, Harry, why don't you ever come over to our house for dinner? Why don't you ever ask me? How about tonight? What's on the Craig menu for tonight? What would you like? I'm sorry, the music is so loud, I can't hear a word you're saying. - Who's he talking to? - You! - Who, me? - Yes, stop talking. - I didn't hear anybody talking, did you? - Only the conductor. Can't talk and play at the same time. He's right, you know, I've tried it, it's almost impossible, you can't... All right, bar 77. What would you like? Roast beef and French fried potatoes. - Kay? - Yes? It's finished. - What? - My letter to Richard. Oh, I think it's beautiful. Do you want to hear it? Well, no, Joan, I... "Dearest of all Richards." How's that for an opening? - It's very nice, but I have to get dressed... - You sit right there and listen. "Now I know what the poets mean." Every hour seems an eternity, "every minute a year, and every second a month." - Sound good, huh? - Mm-hmm. "Why did you have to go away? Is it because the fates are often cruel to those who are too happy?" - Hello. - Hello. Golly gee. Here's another good part. "And even the clouds in the sky..." Golly, golly. What do you want, Mouse? You're both so dumb that you think a musician has to have long hair, huh? Look, this is better. "And every breeze is like a whisper from you in the darkness." - Good, huh? - Kay, would you believe that a man can play the piano better than anyone else in the world, and play football too? At the same time? Now, stop being childish. "The same time." Say, what are you raving about? You're not going to find out anything about anything by asking me anything that way. Of course, he's not blond, but he has blue eyes and beautiful hands. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Will you please let me finish reading my letter? Well, go ahead, read it. Who's stopping you? Very idea... And listen, how do you like this? "There's no way to measure love." Ecstasy has no limits. "It's as boundless as infinity and as timeless as..." Is this about six feet? No, a little more. Why? Oh, I just... I come up about to his chest here. Whose chest? Oh, just somebody I met today. A genius, handsome genius. Huh? I just thought of who he looks like. Clark Gable. - Clark Gable? - Uh-huh, Clark Gable. - Who does? - Harry. Who's Harry? Now, isn't she getting just like Daddy? I've been telling you about Harry, you've been asking me about Harry, we've all been talking about Harry, and now she says, "Who's Harry?" Then tell us, who is he, Mouse? Well, he's... Well, you'll see him. He'll be here at 7:30 for dinner, and then you'll be able to... Oh, I have to tell Binns and Mommy about it! Oh, and you girls hurry up and get dressed, and wear something nice. I don't want him to think my sisters are a couple of scarecrows. - Binns? - Yes, Miss Penny? We have to have roast beef and French fried potatoes for dinner tonight. Roast beef and French fried potatoes? - Yes. - Tonight? - Yes, I'm having a guest. - But Miss Penny, Cook will be most annoyed if we ask her to change the menu at this hour. He's tall, dark, and handsome. Yes, Miss Penny, but Cook's rather temperamental, and I... Oh, tall, dark, and handsome. - Yes. - You mean, this young man is a... Hello, Kay. - Uh, but I'll... - Yes, Miss Penny. And, uh, you'll take care of that, Binns, and, uh, I'll... Oh, Mother, I've invited a friend of mine from the music school for dinner tonight. - Is that all right? - Oh, why, of course, Penny. - I was just telling Binns about it now. - I think all your friends are very nice. Oh, yes, he's very... Nice? He's sensational! Golly! Oh, Binns, we have to go tell Cook about it. Who is this Penny's having in to dinner tonight? Well, we don't know, Mother. She just says he's everything from a dream prince down to a genius. She's been talking about him for the last half hour. - So do you know who he is? - Ah, he's the man Penny's in love with. - Oh, not really. - Yes, she is! Well, she's been telling us how smart he is and how tall he is... He's probably some overgrown child in his first pair of long pants. - Oh, good evening, sir. - Good evening. My name is Loren, Harry Loren. Yes, I know, sir. We were expecting you, sir. Is everything all right? Oh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Excuse me, sir, may I? Harry! Oh, I'm so glad you could come around. Really I am. Gosh, you look beautiful all dressed up. You don't look so bad yourself. Me? Oh, these are just my overalls. I have to be at work at 9:30. - Oh, no. - Yes, yes, and I have to leave here at 9 o'clock sharp, you see, because we're going on the a... We're going on the air. - What's wrong? - Oh, nothing, nothing. Did you have any trouble finding the house? Yes, I walked past it twice, I... I thought it was a museum of natural history or something of the WPA bill. Oh, Mother, this is Harry Loren. - How do you, Mr. Loren? - And Harry, this is my mother. How do you do, Mrs. Craig? I was just admiring your... And this is my sister, Katherine. Of course, all her friends call her Kay. Penny's been telling us all about you, Mr. Loren. - Oh, I haven't told you half... - I suppose that this is your other sister. Oh, yes, that's Joan, she's engaged. Well, let's go sit by the fire. - How do you do? - How do you do, Mr. Loren? I've known Penny for quite some time, but... well, I didn't know that she had a... I just thought Mr. Loren might like a cocktail or something to drink before dinner. A glass of milk. Yes, sir. Milk before dinner, Mr. Loren? No, no, after breakfast. You see, I had to skip lunch today. I've been working pretty hard. Harry. Here. We'll have dinner just as soon as Mr. Craig arrives. He's so busy lately, we hardly know when to expect him. Oh, if I had a cozy little place like this, I'd be home all the time. Harry, won't you sit down? - Thank you. - Oh, no, over here. Of course, the thing that would bother me would be dusting the ceiling. What do you use, ladders or long-handled brooms... Nobody but Harry would think of questions like that. You know, Mother, he's really a genius. - Kay, he plays every musical instrument... - Oh! Is this... excuse me. Is this the terrible trio? Oh, that picture was taken 12 years ago. - In Switzerland. - In Switzerland? That's a remarkable likeness for Switzerland. Kay's the prettiest, isn't she? Well, I don't know, that's a hard question to decide. She's always been the prettiest, hasn't she, Mommy? You're all beautiful to me, darling. Oh, I know it, but you always called her Pretty Kitty, didn't she, Joan? - Yes, she did. - That's unfair, you are the pick at this place. Of course, Kay always de... I'll bet Penny cried a lot when she was a baby. She did her share. That wasn't really crying, she was just trying to reach high C. Speaking of that, I haven't shown you the fountain yet, have I? - What does a fountain to do with... - Perhaps Mr. Loren would rather sit here, darling. Oh, no, Mother, he has to see the fountain. It's the prettiest thing Daddy ever bought. - It's from Versailles. - Versailles? And it's in all the books. It's really perfectly gorgeous... Everybody who sees it just raves and raves about it. Well, where is it? Oh, the fountain? It's out there. Oh, say! Say, that is a pretty thing, isn't it? Really. I'm glad you like it. Well, come on, let's go inside now, huh? Well, wait a minute, give me a chance to look at it. It looks much better in the daytime. You come back tomorrow. That's the quickest look at a fountain I ever took. Well, there's not much sense looking at a fountain when the water isn't running. I'll go even farther than that, there's not much sense... - Oh, where have you been? - Here. Well, I don't think it's very polite to disappear when people are talking. I didn't disappear, I just walked outside. You certainly wouldn't like me to do that if you had company. Well, next time I'll be sure to get your permission. - Kay, please. - Please don't stop them. - My money's on Penny. - Here, Harry. Well, go right ahead, girls. Now, don't let me interrupt you. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Do they fight much? Haven't you any brothers or sisters, Mr. Loren? Me? No, I'm the last of the Lorens. People usually stand up and cheer when I say that. As a matter of fact, I... Your milk, sir. Thank you. - Is that it? - No. The name Loren sounds familiar. You're not from Virginia, by any chance? No, ma'am, I'm from New Hampshire, but I've lived in New York for the last 11 months. - Your parents are here too? - My parents are dead. Oh, I'm sorry. They were a great pair. Dad was a lawyer. He always wanted to be a musician. You should've heard him play the cello. But his father made him be a lawyer. They were all lawyers, his father, his grandfather. His great-grandfather was a pirate too. They hanged him in Jamaica. I guess that's why Dad never liked to wear a necktie. We had a grandfather who was a horse thief. A great-great-grandfather, Penny. And he didn't really steal the horses. And they didn't hang him. 'Cause they couldn't catch him. My dad was an all-time low as a lawyer, never made any money. Well, yes, he did once, he won a case. I think the other lawyer was sick or something. He made $300. You know what he did with it? He bought a statue of Beethoven. Mother burned up. I'll never forget that day as long as I live. She threw Beethoven out the window and chased Dad clear down to the barn and rolled him in the snow. Golly, they loved each other. They died on the same day. It always seemed like they just went off some place together to have more fun. Was your mother a musician too? Sure, she gave me my first piano lessons. We rehearsed like mad all through autumn, and then when winter came, we were snowed in, and we gave a concert. They weren't bad. A big log crackling in the fireplace, and outside, sleet and snow and wind, and inside, our audience was a big black cat and three hound dogs. Dad used to say that a wintery night was a symphony in C minor. Mom said it was a Strauss waltz. There's one waltz she loved. Say, does that piano work? I'll play it for you. That last concert was a dilly. Big audience, the cat had kittens that year, and the collector was there to get either $10 or the piano. He finally settled for Dad's law book. And don't think that Dad wasn't tickled pink to get rid of them. And Mother just stood up and cheered. Good piano. Oh, it's beautiful. - It's outrageous. - What? I want you to know that my sister Joan is engaged to be married, Mr. Loren. I'm aware of that sad fact, Miss Craig. Then why don't you behave like a gentleman? Penny. Well, I didn't invite him here to flirt with Joan. - If Richard were here... - Penny! I'm sorry, Mrs. Craig, I don't know what she means. You don't know what I mean? Well, what was this for, and what was that sick-cow look for? You don't know what I mean? Well, you certainly... Penelope Craig, control yourself. - That's not nice, Penny. - That's just what I'm saying. And don't you deny it. My eyes can see what's going on in front of my nose, you big, big... - Penny, now apologize for that. - I didn't say it yet! You big... You said more than enough. Now tell Mr. Loren you're sorry. - Oh, Mrs. Craig, that's not necessary. - I'll say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever brought you here. I'm sorry I ever saw you! Young lady, go upstairs this instant. All right, I'll go. You'll be sorry. Wait till I see you tomorrow. I'll tell you a thing or two. I shouldn't be the one that's apologizing. You should be the one. Winking at Joan. Treating me like a child. I'm just getting tired of this... You big nincompoop! That's what you are! Well, I'm afraid I'll have to go. Oh, no, please, Mr. Loren. I just remembered that I have an early rehearsal... I don't know what came over Penelope. - She never acts like that. - Never, really. Well, I'd rather like to. I mean, it was nothing. Then you will stay? Well, I can't really. It's been fun seeing all of you, seeing the fountain. Thanks for the milk. I'll see you out. Don't bother, I'll... I'll run along. But just as you say. Binns, will you get Mr. Loren's things? - Well... - I do want to apologize for us all. Don't bother. Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night. - Good... Miss Joan, it's been a pleasure. Thank you, Mr. Loren. Miss Penny's just a child, sir... I don't want biographies, I want my hat and coat. That poem, sir, "the best-laid schemes of mice and men." I don't want poetry, I don't want mice, I want my hat and coat. Very good, sir, but I do feel... Now, look here, young fellow. Your eyes have been burning holes in the back of my neck all evening, and if I see you looking at me once again, I'm going to get very mad and take you apart until I find that little machine that says, "Yes, sir," "no, sir," "very good, sir," and I'm going to break it, see? - Yes, sir. - Now get my hat and coat. Very good, sir. Here. So long. Your hat and coat, sir. Oh. Call my office, I'll be there in five minutes. Oh, Mr. Craig, I beg your pardon, sir. - What's the matter? - The coat, sir, the coat. Oh, there must be something wrong, call my tailor. No, no it's the young man, sir. - He was here... - What young man? Penny's young man, Judson. Well, why did Binns give me his hat and coat? Well, there's something more to it than a hat and coat, Judson. Penny's gone quite mad. - Where is Penny? - Upstairs and she's going to stay there. - Where's the young man? - He's gone. Oh, he took my hat and coat, I remember. Oh, Judson, please come into dinner. I must talk to you about Penny. What fine friends Penny has, coat robbers. This situation calls for a father's firm hand not a mother's advice. That'd be all, Binns, I'll ring for you. I have to have a talk with him about that coat, inexcusable. Don't you think Penny's future is a little more important than your coat? Coat and hat. Oh, yes, yes, certainly. Penny, yes. Well, I don't see where there's any great problem there. You didn't see the way she behaved. He bared looked at Joan and Penny went out of her mind with jealousy. She called him a nincompoop. She's right, wait until I see him. Taking my coat, the Gabardine, my best coat. Please, will you try to concentrate? I'm concentrating, go ahead. She sees him in school everyday. Stop her from going to school, forbid her to see him, that's simple. I don't think that's a very good idea. I think it's an excellent idea. Well, that's because you've never been in love. You tell Penny she can't see him and she'll him three times a day. That's right, remember what we did when your father said you couldn't see me? - Judson. - Said I was a gadabout and he was right too. Then her father was laying for me one night. - Judson. - Oh. I know what you can do. After dinner, have her come down to the library and sing for you. Oh, I can't do that, I have to call London tonight. Oh, never mind London, this will only take a few minutes. Then tell her her voice is bad and she's to have no more lessons. She'll believe you, Dad. She says you're the only one in the house that knows anything about music. Did she really say that? - Well, you know now Penny... - Please put it down in your book what you're going to tell her. Just make a note, Penny's voice bad, no more lesson. Penny's voice lov... Bad, no more lessons. Stop knocking there's nobody in here! I brought you some of the roast beef, Ms. Penny. Roast beef, don't you mention roast beef to me. - Now, Ms. Penny, you have to eat. - Why? Well, we all have to eat, Ms. Penny, I always say... Yes, you always say, you said tall, dark and handsome. Yes, we overlooked something there. A very old law in matter of this kind, a law that saw that opposites attract each other. Well it certainly worked out that way. All he did was with Joan all evening, I ought to give her a piece of my mind. Ms. Joan can't help it, blondes and brunettes, brunettes and blondes, - you see it around you everyday. - You should've said that before. Yes, I know, Ms. Penny. It didn't occur to me until I became aware of that young gentleman's interest in Ms. Joan. Something like that can have very serious consequences. Suppose Joan really fell in love with Harry, suppose she decided not to marry Richard at all that would be a pretty... pretty. - Pretty. - Ms? Let me think, Binns. Blondes and brunettes are like day and night, Ms. Penny, one follows the other. How'd you like him, Joan? Dad wants to see you immediately. I know you liked his piano playing. - Dad's waiting for you in the library, mouse. - Yes, I'm going. I just want to talk about... Did you notice his hands when he played those runs? Oh, I think he's wonderful. - He's really something, huh? - Uh-huh. He's the best piano player in North and South America, if you ask me. He plays very well but you ought to be spanked. - Me, why what for? - The way you behaved. Oh, you mean that little argument, oh, that didn't mean anything - you should hear us fight in school all the time. - Excuse me. Ms. Penny? What are you up to now? It's all right, Binns. Every cloud has a silver lining and I'm going to fix up everything tomorrow in The Music School. - Ms. Penny, you can't. - Oh, I can try. But, Ms. Penny. Hello, give me the overseas' operator, I want to talk to Phillip Lon at Gerard 7Z11, London England. - Hello. - Hello, hello? Oh, yes, this is Judson Craig at Trefalgar 70607, that's right. Put the call right through, I'll be here, yes 70607. What do you want, Penny? I don't know, I thought you wanted to see me. Forty-eight-sixty-two and I told him to close at forty-eight-twenty-five. What did you say, Penny? Joan told me you wanted to see me, Daddy. Oh, no, she's wrong. No, no, she's right, she's right, I do, yes. Sing something. - Sing? - Yes, you always sing, don't you? It's all right, sit down there and sing something. - Right here? - Yes. - Now? - Mhm. It's all right, go ahead. - Why do you want me to sing, Daddy? - I'll tell you that later. First you have to sing. What's the matter? I don't know what to sing. Doesn't make any difference, anything will do. - Is The Last Rose of Summer all right? - Perfect, perfect. Go ahead, go on. 'Tis the last rose of summer left blooming alone. All her lovely companions are faded and gone. No flower of her kindred, no rosebud is nigh, to reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh. To reflect back her blushes and give sigh for sigh. More? That was beautiful, Penny. Beautiful. Now go to sleep, like a good little girl. - Did you send for me just to hear me sing? - Mhm. - You haven't asked me to sing in ever so long. - Oh, I've been so busy. Oh, I know, Daddy, that's all right. I tried to tell you something this morning but you were in a hurry. Tell me now, dear. Well, there's something going on that worries me very much, Daddy. What's that, Penny? - You know when Joan got engaged at the party? - Yeah. Afterwards, I found out that Kay... Oh, that's London. Hello, put him on. Hello, Phil? Say, what are you birds trying to do over there, ruin me? I told you two weeks to go to buy 3,500 fourths at $48.25. Yes, I did, $48.25, I got the cable right here. Goodnight, Penny. Where is that cable? Hold on, here it is. Dated the 12th, "Enter our order 3,500 fours at $48.25, signed by me." Who do you think it's signed by? Yes, well, you look it up and cable me right back. Yes, all right, goodbye. $48.62, ridiculous. Oh, Penny! Penny, you stop going to that music school right away. You're voice is awful, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. - What did you say? - I'm notifying your singing teacher tomorrow that you're not taking anymore lessons, now let's not discuss it any further. What do you mean, Daddy? I made myself perfectly clear, no more singing lessons. - But why, Daddy? - Your voice is no good, you have to rest it. But just now, down stairs, you said that it was beautiful. - I made a mistake. - But, Daddy, please, you can't just say things like that. Call my music teacher, call him up right now. I'm not calling up anybody, that's final, complete, finished, over. You're not going back to that school anymore. Mother, you'll have to talk to Daddy, did you hear what he said? - Now, dear, please be calm. - He said that I can't sing anymore, that my voice is no good. You heard me sing at the party, last night, did anybody go home when I started to sing? I think your father knows best, Penny. Well, I don't think he knows anything, I think he's going... Penelope. Your father's doing this for your own good. Now go to bed, please. Mother, can't I just go tomorrow? Just one more day, please, I have something I have to... - No. - Just tomorrow, please. Goodnight, Penny. My own child, she thinks I'm a monster. Well, I hope it's made you very happy. It has and some day she'll thank us for it. - Yes. - Yes. Ah. What's that for? Ah-ah-ah. - Was that bad? - No, it wasn't. You bet you life it wasn't. My voice is awful, a waste of money. - What's that? - That's what they said, - although I don't know why... - Now, Penny. - Stop putting on an act. - An act? It's not your voice, it's Harry, they don't want you to see him anymore. Harry? You mean Harry Loren? - Well, you're in love with him, aren't you? - I'm in what? They think he's a little too old for you. You mean. You mean that they think that... That they think that I'm in love with? - With that? - Now don't play innocent. Oh, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You don't have to fib to us, Mouse. I'm not fibbing, why... What are you talking about? I don't even know him, why today was the first time I ever spoke to him. It was? Then why did you invite him for dinner? And why did you rush him out of the balcony? - Well, simply because I... - And what was that golly for? And why did you tell us he was better looking than Clark Gable? - Well, he is. - He is not. Well, he's not bad. Well, good or bad, I'm not in love with him. Then just explain why you acted like such a monkey downstairs. Yes, what was that for? What was what for? Oh, he merely smiled at Joan and you wanted to commit murder. - Because I... Why. - Because why? Well, in the first place, I brought him here to... - To what? - Well, to... Come on, tell us, why were you so jealous if you're not in love? All right, I'm in love. - Do you want more covers? - No. - Where's your apple? - I don't want any apple, goodnight. Goodnight, mouse. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. - Kay. - Why don't you go to sleep, mouse? I can't. - You love him an awful lot, don't you? - No, I don't. - Really. - I thought so. Come on, everything's going to be all right. - No. - Yes, it is, mouse. I'll help you. You have to see him, Penny. You have to tell him something so he'll know. If you don't, you'll be miserable and then if he falls in love with somebody else you won't know what to do. You'll just keep on thinking and thinking about him until finally, you won't want to do anything but just sit somewhere all by yourself until you die. Penny, you have to do something. You have to. I'll do something, Kay, honest I will. Harry? Harry. Please listen to me just for a minute, won't you, Harry? H... Harry! - Nincompoop is the name. - How do you do? Did you bring my hat and coat? - Oh, no, I didn't. - Well, you won't get these until I get mine back. - Ms. Craig. - I'm not here anymore. I'm not taking anymore singing lessons, I'm not doing anything. Good. Harry! Oh, Harry, please listen. I want to apologize for last night. All right, go ahead. Oh, I just did. I said I wanted to apologize. So? Oh, now don't be angry, Harry. I thought maybe you might forget about last night and come over to our house for dinner tonight. I thought maybe you might just try once more. Say, what do you think I am? We're gonna have roast beef hash. Listen, I wouldn't come to your house for dinner if you had boiled hummingbirds' tongue on toast. - Last night wasn't my fault, Harry... - Oh, I suppose I threw you out. No, it wasn't your fault either but it wasn't my fault, it was hers. Joan's. Well, now you're blaming your sister, that's fine. Oh, no, I'm not blaming her, she couldn't help it, I guess. Otherwise she wouldn't have done it. She didn't do anything, you were the one... If that's what you think, you should've heard her. Why, if you're half as wonderful as she thinks you are, golly. I thought you told me she was engaged? Engaged, oh now, Harry, you know very well that an engagement doesn't mean a thing. My cousin Caroline's been engaged six times and she still isn't married. This is Joan's first engagement. Everybody knows that a first engagement doesn't mean a thing. Tell me more. You see, I sneaked out to see you, nobody knows I'm here. Now you're sure that Joan feels that way? Sure, why the minute you came in her heart did flip-flops. - Now, Penny. - Honestly. She never looked at Richard the way she looked at you at the piano. Hello, Joan. Harry and I... We're talking and he, uh. - The car's downstairs, Penny. - The car. Get your muff. Well, thanks, Penny. If it hadn't been for you, I never would've known she cared. Now, Mr. Loren, I hope you're not silly enough to believe anything that child told you. Of course not, my dear, that part about first engagements, that's very interesting. It doesn't interest me one bit. Oh, the pity of him, what kind of fella is he if he can't keep you interested? Well, I didn't say that, Mr. Loren. - Call me Harry. - I'd like to call you a lot of things. All right, call me a lot of things, Penny told me... Oh, you're a fool, we're both fools for standing here talking about something that we can't do anything about. Oh, I didn't mean that, Harry... Mr. Loren, I, Harry. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. And don't feel sorry for me, in the years to come when I'm all alone, I'll still have your father's hat and coat to remember you by. That's the most miserable, low-down, contemptable, mean trick you every played on me. Have you completely lost your mind? Why did you do it? I thought you were in love with him, why did tell him all that junk about me? - I had to do it, Joan... - But why! I knew he was crazy about you and I thought if I told him, kind of encouraged him, he might come to the house again. Then I could at least see him, even if he didn't talk to anybody but you. - Oh, but that's... - Sorry, Joan. Are you really so fond of him? If he just says hello to me, it's even bigger than sort of cataclysmic. I don't know what you see in him. Just because he's fairly good-looking and kind of tall, just because he has a certain charm and plays the piano very well and has a lot of personality. An awful lot. Just because of that? Yes. You have to forget him, Penny. I can't forget Harry, he just comes creeping up into your mind all the time. Well, push him out when he creeps in. Joan, could you forget someone, just anyone, if you made up your mind to forget him? Of course I could, Penny. - Without breaking your heart? - Of course. Thank you, Joan. I'll try to remember that. Hello, Joan. Oh, Richard, when did you get here? About an hour ago. I sneaked back over the weekend. You see, you're a bad influence on me already. Hiyya, mouse. Say, I've been hearing some bad reports about you. - Oh, I... - Where did you find Penny? - At the school? - Yes, but... I was under he impression, Penelope, your father told you not to go back there. Yes, but I... Oh, let's forget about it, Mother, it isn't important anyway. Say, Kay, would you and Richard show me that new tango step you talked about last... Now don't try to change the subject, young lady. You knew that you were not supposed to go back to that school. - I didn't... - Mother, she probably forgot something - and just went there to get it. - That's right, I forgot something. What did you forget? I... I... Music. Mozart's Hallelujah, it was an F-major, I just couldn't leave that there. - Where is it? - Where? Yes. Oh, it's right around here somewhere. I don't know, it was here. I must've forgotten it. I better run right back and get it now. You better run right upstairs to your room, young lady, and stay there until your father comes home and has a talk with you. All right. I never thought Penny would turn out to be a problem child. I really don't know what to do with her. Let's make her forget this chap. Oh, I wish I knew how. What she needs is a little diversion. I think Richard's right, Mother. Suppose I throw a party tonight and we all go and have Penny as guest of honor. She'll be tired of playing Camille by ten o'clock. Oh, Mr. Craig and I have a dinner date. Oh, I'll take the girls, may I? - Why, that's a grand idea. - It's all agreed then? - Oh, I guess so. - All right, Penny. How about going to the opera tonight? - Opera? - Yes, that will make you forget all your troubles, makes me forget everything. - I don't know. - Well, a ballet? No good, I have it! The wrestling matches, then you'll really see people suffer. Come on, now, be a good egg. A nightclub wouldn't be bad. - A nightclub? - Uh-huh. I think I could forget things there. Some nice noisy place where we can't talk? - Mhm. - All right, which one would you like? Let's look. After long consideration, we have decided what we Craig's needed - was a little nightclubbing in our lives. - But Penny's never been to a nightclub. Oh, I wont' go until Kay goes too. Kay will come along, see how things are looking up already? And don't you ever tell me again that I don't know anything about women. Where will it be, Golden Horn, Le Vie, Drilbies, Club 11, Tavern? Oh, I don't care, Richard, Club 33 sounds all right. - 33, did I say 33 Club? - Didn't you? Oh, here it is, fine, 33 Club it is then and, Penny, I guarantee you the time of your life. Penny, come on, come on. - This isn't a bad place, is it? - Lovely. Penny's a good picker. Oh, how about something special, squab a la suite? - I'm really not very hungry... - Good, hors d'oeuvre for three - and squab a la suite for our celebrated guest. - Bien, monsieur. You don't seem very happy, Penny. Don't you worry about her. She's gonna have a lot of fun here tonight, aren't you, Penny? Oh, yes, I think I'm going to have fun all right. I have a feeling this is going to be a real big night and you know, I'm psychic about things like that. Come on now, Penny, how about a nice big smile? That's the girl, now we're getting some place. Hello. Why, Harry, what in the world are you doing here? Why, I work here, I thought I told you last Saturday? Oh, well you did but I didn't think it was this place. It's the only 33 Club in New York. Oh, is it, I thought there were dozens of them. Penny, I don't believe I've met this gentleman. - My name is Watkins. - I'm sorry, this is Mr. Loren. This is Richard Watkins, Joan's fiancé. - Howdy. - Howdy. You remember my sisters, of course. Oh, of course, good evening. Won't you join us? Oh, well, I'm supposed to be working but I guess they can get along - without a piano player. - Here you are, Harry. Oh, thanks. You see, in this type of music you really don't get much of the piano anyhow. Well, I hate to mention it but you're supposed to have a good time at the 33 Club. Funerals, weddings, and other sad occasions are more or less banned by the management. Will somebody please say something or do I have to sing? I'm sorry, but this whole thing strikes me as being very funny. Is it a family joke or can I get in on it? Mr. Loren, you're not only in on it, you're it. How nice. Penny is incorrigible. That act she put on when we arrived. I really do feel sad. Is this a new game, you know, I don't get around very much. No, I'm afraid it's a rather old game. - I think, perhaps, we better be going. - Oh, no, no, Richard. Please, we just got here. We don't want Harry to think that he drove us away. I'd like to talk to Mr. Loren, Richard. - Certainly, go ahead. - Alone. - Why, I have no private office but... - Suppose we dance? - Do you mind, Richard? - Not at all. I'd do anything to solve the mystery. Well? I don't know whether or not you're aware of it, Mr. Loren but my sister Penny is violently in love with you. - She's what? - Madly in love with you. - Penny? - Penny. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. It's true, you have to do something about it. Penny says it's you, you tell me it's Penny. - Can't you girls make up your mind? - This is very serious, Mr. Loren. Oh, don't worry about it, Ms. Craig, because I won't be seeing Penny very much. The trouble is she'll see you, don't you see... Well, that'd be pretty hard because after the first I'm going away. - Oh. - Yes, to Australia. They've been offering me a job for months in a symphony orchestra and I just decided today to take it. - Australia? - Yeah, oh, it's a very nice place Australia. Nice people. So I guess that'll finish what's worrying you, huh? That's right, Harry, it will. Good. That... that's rather far away, Australia, isn't it? Yes, it is very far away. Yes. Hey, Beethoven fun is fun, now climb back on that stool - or I'll have to get another boy. - Get another boy. Mm, all right, friend, have a good time. For now on you're one of the cash customers. Maybe you better go back? No. They're not talking now, their lips aren't even moving. - You sound as if you were jealous. - Jealous? - Kay, do I look as though I'm jealous? - I'm afraid so, Penny. You seem to forget that Joan's engaged. I did... She seems to forget it, you mean. Look at that, I'll bet Kay would never dance with another man - if she were engaged to you. - Penny. - Well, you wouldn't, you think too much of... - That'll be all, Penny. You know, Kay's always said that you were her idea of what a man should be... - Penny, stop that nonsense. - Well, you did. - Now you're making her blush. - I'm not blushing. - I think we better leave. - Well, we can't until Joan gets through talking to Harry. - Penny, you're a little vixen. - And you're blind. Penny, will you please stop? No, I won't, I like Richard and I'm only trying to do him a favor. That's very sweet of you. You know, Kay is much more in love with you than... Penny, don't say things like that! I'm only saying what's true. - She's just jealous, Richard, it's a lie. - It is not a lie. - It is. - It isn't either, I prove it. - Well, go ahead. - But she can't. - I can so. - Stop it! It's not a lie, I saw you the night of the party when you... Richard, you don't believe her, do you? Oh, Kay, don't be so upset. It's that man, she's so jealous she'll say anything. I didn't burn any diary, you believe me, don't you? Yes, Kay, I'll believe anything you say. I'm sure that Penny didn't mean to upset you so, did you, Penny? Here she is. I suppose you think you did a very smart thing this evening? I'm sorry. I think Kay was perfectly right, she told me all about it. I said I was sorry. You're sorry, you're hateful. You don't care what happens to us as long as you do what you want. I'll never do anything like that again. No, not till the next time. You never think of anyone but yourself. You're the most selfish girl I ever knew in all my life. I told you, I'd never do anything again. You don't have to, he's going to Australia! - I hope he'll stay there. - He will, he's never coming back. Don't cry to me about it. Cry? Why should I cry about it? I don't ever want to see him again. I never want to hear his name mentioned. I hate him, I hate you, I hate everybody! Joan? Yes? Mouse? You think I'm awfully mean, don't you? Well, I am. Could you forgive me for what I did, Penny? Please? Well, then just say it's all right, will you? Can't you even say that, Penny? I'll never talk to you again as long as I live. Penny. Funny thing, when I was a kid I wanted to paint flagpoles, and I wind up tacking doilies on the ceiling. Oh, I'm so glad Richard brought you over, Mrs. Watkins. - When did you arrive? - Just this minute. We rushed here from the station to say hello you and the girls. But we're going to run right along, I know how busy you are. - We still have some last minute shopping to do. - I see. My dear, you don't seem a bit nervous the day before your wedding. Weddings don't bother brides, it's the grooms. I remember the day before my wedding, I decided not to get married at all. Henry! Well, I'm glad I did, of course, dear, now very. Certainly is noisy in here, isn't it, Penny? Hey, Eddie, you mean up here? Yeah, that's all right. You mind finding another chair, miss? We've got some work to do around here. May I offer you tea or something, you're probably tired. Oh, don't bother, we had breakfast on the train. I'd ask you to come upstairs only it's worse up there than it is down here. No need to apologize, I know exactly how inconvenient things like this can be. - Penny? - What? You haven't changed your mind have you? Just go out and speak to her. That'll be the nicest wedding present you could give me. Penny, there will only be two Craig sisters instead of three after tomorrow. We won't be together anymore. You'll both be here and I'll be on my honeymoon with Harry. Who? With Richard. Joan, I have to try your veil on again, I think it's a little bit too tight. Hello, Penny, I hate to drag Joan away like this but someday I'll be making one of these for you too. Please, Penny. You mind if I hide out from the family? No, not at all. This fresh air feels good. It's a lovely day. Yes, it is lovely. Kay, I've been wondering about something. So have I, about luncheon, aren't you starved? No, afraid not. I tried to eat breakfast on the train but I kept thinking... I'd rather eat on a train than any place else in the world. I guess it's because you can look out the window and wonder who lives in all the houses that fly by, what they do and all about them. In one look? Certainly, if you try to take another look it's too late. That's right, Kay. It's too late. This will be roped off, of course. The aisle ends here and the ceremony will take place, - well, I should say about here. - It's perfect. And certainly wedding breakfast we're going to serve in the dining room. Breakfast, that's the best part of the wedding. - Mother? - Yes, Penny? May I speak to you for just a minute, please? What is it, dear? Mother, this wedding is all a mistake, please postpone it for just a few days. Joan really doesn't want to marry Richard... Oh, what I have I done to deserve such a child? Young lady, haven't you caused enough trouble? - But honesty, Mother... - One more word out of your, Penny, and I'll lock you in your room until the wedding is over. Now please, what would happen if Richard's family heard you talk like that? Is Penny going to sing at the wedding? Oh, yes, of course, yes, of course Penny's going to sing. But right now she's going up to rest. Aren't you, Penny? I want to show you the table arrangements in here. - I'm sure they're lovely. - Oh, they really are. Going up please. Going down please. Where do you think you're going, young lady? - To see my father. - And who is your father? - Mr. Craig. - Oh, Ms. Craig, Ms. Klein will take care of you. To the cashier right away and tell him to send the guarantee for transfer... - Yes, ma'am. - I'm sorry, Mr. Frost, I don't think Mr. Craig will be able to see you until after the 25th, I'm sorry. I'm Penelope Craig, could I see my father please? Oh, well, Ms. Craig, I don't know what to tell you, your father is... Mr. Craig's office, oh, America, we had that stock list on the... Hello, Mr. Andrews. Why, Ms. Penelope, I hardly knew it was... Could I see my father please? - Now? - It's very important. Well, Ms. Penelope, he's in a big meeting but I'll see what I can do. Have a seat please. - Yes? - Mr. Craig, Ms. Penelope is here - and wants to see you. - I don't know of any, Ms. Penelope - and don't bother me now with it! - Craig, Ms. Penelope is... Don't bother me! And I'm to float a ten million dollar bond issue and handle six million in preferred stock I must have control of the common to do it! Stanhope will never agree to to that case, J.C... What do you mean, he'll never agree? He has agreed! Get me Stanhope on the phone! - Yes, sir. - Yes. Penny. How did you get in here? Oh, I just came, Daddy. Could I speak to you for just a minute, please? Gentlemen, this is my daughter, Penelope. - How do you do? - How do you do? J.C, suppose he'll make the bondage of seven million, the preferred stock of nine million... Now listen, you buzzards, no matter how you figure it, you'd always get the same answer! No, siree, not a chance. Sit down, Penny, I'll be with you in a minute. How would you like to handle the bonds, J.C, let us handle the preferred? No, no, no, Henry, what do you think I am, a child? You still can cut in on the common stock! Say, is Stanhope telling you fellas that's I'm getting old or something? - You got Stanhope, Ms. White? - I'm waiting, sir. Oh, Penny, Penny, yes, what's on your mind? I wanted to talk to you alone, Daddy. Well, I can't leave here now, baby. But we can talk, these gentlemen are all my friends. Well, tomorrow is the wedding, Daddy and I... I know, I know, you need some money to buy something. No, no, I don't need any money, I just need... - Mr. Stanhope's on the wire, Mr. Craig. - That's fine. Hello, Stanhope, say, what's this switch your crowd's trying to put over? Never mind the soft talk, I want to bonds, the preferred, the common, or handle it yourself. Yes, okay, goodbye. That's that, gentlemen. Now if you bandits will step into the boardroom, we'll sign the contracts, my contracts. Penny? Penny. I thought you wanted to see me? I don't want to see you, I don't want to see anybody anymore. What's wrong, baby? Nothing. Now, now, there, there now, Penny, don't cry. Sit down, tell me all about it. You won't listen to me. Nobody will listen to me. I'm by myself. Nobody will listen to me. Oh, uh, J.C, can we have you in here just a minute? - Just one minute... - We'd like to get this settled... Get out, get out, boys, please everybody get out! Everybody. Don't cry, child. They've all gone, we're alone and we can talk now. There, there, there, come, come. You have to tell me what's wrong if you want me to help you. You won't understand if I do. Oh, yes, I will, I promise I will. No you won't. You'll have to talk to London or Paris or sell stocks or something. Well, that's business, work. I have to work to give you and your mother and sisters the things you need. We don't need things. What good are they when everybody in our family is so unhappy? We need somebody to help us when we're in trouble and listen to us when we ask for help. Not be a million miles away and not even care when Kay is breaking her heart and Joan is so unhappy. She doesn't know what to do. Tomorrow's the wedding. Now it's too late to do anything. Now tell me just what happen. - Mr. Craig, hello, Mr. Craig? - Hello, Mr. Craig, Mr. Craig? Mr. Craig, operator? You'll have to hold on, San Francisco, I can't get him. Mr. Craig is busy, I'll have him call you back, Mr. Ward. - I wonder what's wrong. - I have no idea. - Hello? - Mr. Craig is busy. - Hold on please. - Hello, hello, Craig, Craig? - I can't get him on the private line. - You'll have to get him, - that stock's dropping a point a minute. - Get out there on the floor and keep buying. - Try another phone. - Let me take the phone. Is he there or isn't he? Oh, never mind, take this cable to Craig. Tell him Rio's offering 125,000 at 92 and we'll have to close immediately. - 125,000. - I can't get him on the phone. But I stayed up all night to make these translations and now he doesn't want them. Will you take this cable into Mr. Craig right away... - I'm afraid I can't do that. - But it's on the Rio case. - I'm sorry, he'll have to wait. - But I don't think you understand, Mr. Craig has been trying to weeks to close this. Sorry, Mr. Reed but you can't go in there. - What, why? - I don't know except that Mr. Craig - doesn't want to be disturbed. - I don't think you know - who Mr. Reed is, young man. - Yes, I do but Mr. Craig is very busy on a most important manner. Important, I'd like to know who's in on this more important than Mr... Say, Craig, I've been waylaid outside and stopped in here. All right, go right in, I'll be back in a minute. - Order my car. - Yes, sir. - Mr. Craig- - The translations are ready, Mr. Craig. Good. Now you run along home now, baby. And don't tell anyone you were here. Hello, Freddy. Oh, hello, Mr. Craig, I'm... You know my daughter, Penelope? No, I don't, I haven't had the privilege. How do you do? You have a daughter too, haven't you? A daughter and a son. How are they getting along? Oh, they're all right I guess. What do you mean, you guess? Well, Mr. Craig, I get home after they're in bed and leave before they get up every morning. So I don't see very much of them. You go home and see that they're all right. But, Mr. Craig, we have to have the balances every two days. I'm the boss, Freddy, and don't come back until you're sure your children are happy. Now you go right home, baby, and don't worry. There won't be any wedding tomorrow. I'll take you over the the alter, Ms. Penelope. This way. Then other way, Judson, you're going the wrong way. Because, you come to me, with naught save love, And hold my hand and lift mine eyes above, - What's happening? - I don't know. A wider world of hope and joy I see. - Sh. - But, Daddy. Because you come to me. Because you speak to me in accent sweet I find the roses waking 'round my feet, And I am led through tears and joy to thee. Because you speak to me. - Where is Joan? - Don't worry. What? Because God made thee mine I'll cherish thee, through light and darkness through all time to be. And pray His love may make our love divine. Because God made thee mine.
