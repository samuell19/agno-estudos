Here it is - the death! You was looking for Goga? I was carrying our supplies ... Supplies! Are you better? You are sitting - it's good, it's nice. You are clearly on the mend! Nothing, Elya - I just brought the goods, I almost done - soon our business will improve. What are you doing? I'm your doctor. Your nurse. Your nanny. It's cold outside. Perhaps, the snow will fall in the night. What is the hell! You are cold or something? So right, we now will heat up ... No, we have to go that way! Don't help, I will go myself. Sure? ... fist time and just one. Goga left me here. You know, he went for fishing, could sprain a foot ... may be he met a beast - this is taiga. Goga couldn't just disappear, he's strong - he can withstand it. Of course, of course. Why we need so much wood? So much? It's for the whole winter. Really - we will stay here all winter!? And what else we can do? We cannot leave the place ... Helicopter will arrive only in February. But the expedition camp should be close by? It was, but they finished all works in the summer. Go, go inside. You was ill for a long time - you can burn you eyes by sunlight. Don't go out without sunglasses! Food on the stove, do not forget medication - I'm leaving ... Don't go away! I will be back soon - will just check the traps and return. Don't go, please! I feel terribly alone. Damn! I already told you - the document was signed - took a prepayment - I should hunt.

I smells bad - I'm not a dog! Eat! You just have to eat. I won't! Calm down. In Moscow, you will tell people about the hysterics - as you refuse to eat grouses.... They will laugh to tears! The self-service store is far from here. Now food became hard to get, and it will be even more difficult soon. Let me help you, I must at least do some work. Sure, you must. You have to go out bring firewood, cut twigs, shovel show. Now you are my buddy, workmate. Who? You have to live with me in the union. The winter is long. The main thing about it - don't be spiteful. Today's people are weak. The tundra makes them hysterical. And before? In the past days, I believe, people had stronger nerves. Let me make you a haircut. How do you think, buddy? Middle cut? or short? Do, panna, the best you can. Akim, how old are you? I'm old, panna ... Don't fidget! Stop tickle me! I'm already clean! The only good for the man - the eastern wisdom says is an ability to eat and drink, and also feel well in his labor. Good wisdom - let's eat, and the wisdom isn't a hindrance. And to drink - says the wisdom! Drink - warm your soul! We shouldn't - it's a medicine. You spent amost all for me - but now you are frozen ... tired ... I will drink too ... Then it's fine. I want to ask you for long time - Elya - it's what name? Full name will be Elvira. Bizarre! But you are however a good woman! And I'll never give you up, I will save you. If we will die - only together ... Really? It's true, Akim, true. You have to eat. All will be okay Elvira. Let us feast! We still have enough ... Drink, Akim, drink! We will survive, it's too early to die! I love you too - I will never, never forget you. I want to smoke and go to bed .. We had feasted and it's enough - need get up early tomorrow. We need to sew shoes and a jacket for you. Oh, hunter, you spoiled the party! Maybe you have other urgent business? Yes, I remember, the sinus - I should listen to you. Well, if you have to listen - listen. Then, I will dim the light or not? Why!? You're a doctor - and the doctors aren't shy. I'm a charlatan, not a doctor. Oh, your ear is so cold! Wait, I will heat it in the moment. Hey, cutie, throw the shirt, crawl to the barn! I won't cripple you - I true old farrier! Your jokes ... Quiet, breath! Get away! Don't sniffle here. Your boorish jokes, they are offensive to women. And they don't suit you. I can change nothing - I was raised this way. The appointment is over! The rale is under the left shoulder blade, under the right - I don't hear. The nature gave you a lot of mind and tact. So, don't show off. Take the medicine - do you hear? Bitter! Bitter. I want to smoke, can I go out? My nanny, sweet, kind nanny. my hope. my desired. I'm afraid without you, If we will die - then only together. my dear, my kind, my darling. Do you know George Gertsev? You sleep? Where is your medal, Kiryagin? Akimka - kill me! Kill me like a dog. I do not understand myself how it happened ... He lured, tricked. Well ... Snip, with pliers - that's all. Who!? Don't want to speak? - but I know who .. He gave me a bottle of cheap port wine ... Kaymaydar! Return the medal to Kiryagin! This is the medal of Kiryagin. Hey, is it nice? Much better than others - do you think? For Tsar fish. You are bastard! Shit - you are the scoundrel. Kiryagin was a sniper - he was blown up by a mine, he is sick and old. I used the medal for right purpose, but for what he could use it? He had nothing, but the medal. Kiryagin is a holy man - it is bad to offend him. It's a sin to do such things. Yes, I don't care - I'm my own God ... But I will punish you, for the insult. Will strangle you, like a dog. So, what are you waiting? Go in the prison for such a stink ... Get lost! Well, let's fight! What are you doing? Stand up, fight! Such scuffles are for noobs like you, I'm don't want to fight with you. You have a lot of friends here, but I'm only one. Let's shoot as noble people do, then - no problems! Well, let's shoot, But in the taiga without witnesses. I don't want too, to go in the prison for a nit like you. You won't go in the prison - you will lie in taiga forever. You know - I don't like to be indebted. Scoundrel! What happened? What? Oh, you ... What's wrong? Set stove fire hotter. ... felt in washout. set fire! Help me, Elya. Elya, if something happened to me, you too ... Don't sleep, don't sleep Akim! Don't sleep, listen to me, don't sleep! Well, how are you, Akim? Fit as a fiddle! When had you all things done - I didn't hear anything. Thank you. Dress up! To table! Let's go, doggie. I already fed her. The need is a simple thing, but it teaches! Eat more - chatter less. Eat, pan, you will be healthy! Damn, you have a good memory! No wander, you are college student! When I was talking this way ... ? I remember - you was so ill, couldn't hold head straight in that time ... Happy! What? 'Happy' bus ticket. He had to eat it. Sure!? When we will come out of the taiga - you have to hand it over to the police and declare a missing person. Akim? And where is he? He is not ... ? He won't come back? I don't know - when I will, I would tell you. Throw it in the stove? No, no - it's his diaries. Maybe there are recent records, which can explain some things or some valuable geology data, - he was looking for the gold. What happened? Akim. Who he is for you - a husband? or just a fleeting passion? Well, it isn't my businesses, We need just wait for the helicopter and that's all! Do not worry, we, as the saying goes - it the life they met by chance and therefore left each other soon ... Very clever! Come on, would we read? Well, let's read ... Happiness for the man - I want, happiness for the woman - he wants. Free ... Friedrich ... Friedrich Nietzsche - a philosopher. It's his thinking. Strange thoughts - I'm not, panna, agree. It isn't good ... What isn't good? All fish gone, rolled downstream... How I will nourish you, then? I, myself, accustomed to live in taiga, rough, vagabond, virile and unmarried. Stop worrying - we will survive somehow! Yor read, read ... ... Having seen this rat race near the public feeders, I created the goal to learn everything, which is necessary for independent from others life. Temper the mind and the body to go where I want, do only what I like, rely only on myself, listen only myself and be responsible for myself only.. What? Why then he did all the stuff!? Hurt men, betrayed women ... He is really a chatterer or something! Do you know him? Met him ... speak with him? Yes - he is quite known personality. A lot of these types now go in the forest, kill birds, fish, without purpose. messed everything, start fires. and never bother to ask what is such a thing - taiga! Is it suitable for the promenades, then? Taiga also has its own character, like a woman ... Here are some verses, should I skip them? Don't skip, we have a lot of time, until you will be healed. Of course, But I have to get up early tomorrow, set up nets, check traps. Well, well ... And here is the writing by other hand, the letters are tiny, I cannot see well ... But you have to try! Well, then, "No one hurt you, mister, but you hurt everybody." This is a woman writing. Ledum - it's good to kill bedbugs . Here is again, the woman wrote: "Suddenly I remembered a story - once the plane landed badly, many passengers were wounded and needed the help. Meanwhile, two healthy strong guys, were stepping over them, searching for their bags. It seems to me that one of them was you - Mr. Gertsev." And here is his answer - bad words and various obscenity ... Read! I won't - this is gross indecency! Eh, Damn! In what shit I have stumbled! All this vulgarity, vulgarity. Lord, where to hide from it! It caught me in the taiga ... It's nothing Elya, nothing ... I'm confused in my life, Akim. He drowned me in words, deceived Damn! I don't understand anything, May be enough to read this Nietzsche! What? It would be nice to go sleep - my legs ache ... If sleep - then go to sleep. Duska, Duska, Duska! What are you doing? Waiting you. I was waiting, waiting - and also wanted to catch a fish. Well, what did the fishermen catch? Two taimens? One small as a louse, another even less! Want to learn how to catch fish? Yes. What they are doing? What do you feel Duska!? Looks like a wolverine visited us. What happened? The wolverine, the devil! A sneaky beast. It will spoil all things which it cannot take away. Sit down, don't trample! Why did you not close the door? I was in a hurry to meet you. Eh! Perhaps, it crawled through the gap ... Through the gap! We are now without flour, without cereals and without sugar. Decided! We must leave here, cet out as soon as possible. We cannot survive only eating wildfowl! You are a spoiled and delicate woman. We are leaving? When? It isn't risk to leave, the problem is don't vanish after! You have no shoes and no clothes, can you sew or knit? I made doll dresses, and embroidered my mother apron at the school lessons. For the doll! you must learn! Just to get out of the damn place! If we won't get out this week, we will stuck here until February! But you have sick lungs, you need good food, medicine. And we must leave the food in the cabin - it's the law of the taiga! I ran through the river - it almost everywhere frozen. Kurejka has airholes - I didn't step on it. Eh, the verst is long in taiga! Well, what should I do? If we will pass Kureyka, In fifty versts there will be a lake. A brigade of fishermen live there. There flies the plane, they have a radio operator. I caused a lot of problem for you! Messed up all your plans. I don't care about hunting, and about prepayment and about everything in the world! I just wish to save you. Akim ... Eh, Elya, Elya ... Why I do live on earth! I never been in Krasnoyarsk, even once, I don't mention Moscow. I have a friend, he went over the globe in the merchant fleet. He was In Africa, in India ... and in many other places. The ate snakes and the turtles! He drunk the overseas wine - and ate rose petals! And why did my mother give birth to me? Why do you say that, Akim? You'll still visit everywhere! You will come to me to Moscow, I will take you to the theater, to the circus, If only we could get out of here! Really you couldn't do anything? Yes, the front paws got into the trap, He began to twitch and broke them - I had to shoot him. Sleep my dog - you have done a nice job! With God blessing. On the road! Remember this vicious place. Here is Gertsev? Yes, I found him here, and buried - right under that stone. Go, say goodbye to him - you, by the way, were fellow travelers ... Elya! go here - I have to listen to you, Sinus. Ow-ow! Hold on, hold on ... Breathe! More! Well, doctor, how is my soul? Not very good. What are we going to do? Die? No need to die. Akima ... dear ... I will overcome. I will gather all my strength. Let's go. I'm almost healthy - that's just the lungs. So what then? Many people live with one lung. We will get there, Akim! Let's go! More! Oh! You lie down, have a rest. You lie down, have a rest. Come on Foma - the village is near, In cutie's house light went out, but the road there is slippery ... Hold on, don't sleep! Don't sleep, don't sleep! Rub my cheeks harder!

You see - it's painful! And ... me? Where have you brought me? Where are the people? Where's the radio? Where's the plane? I want to see my mom in Moscow! Where's the radio? Where is the plane? I will die here, die, I cannot stand it anymore! Die! I will feed the foxes with you sweetie - at least will make some good. All people from here have already left - how do I know? Whims - tears, thank God, that we at least got here, or else we would be eaten by animals, for our good!. I have only a pity for the dog - it isn't her fault. Rest here dog, you have deserved! A scheduled flight passes above this camp - it's all our hope. How much from here to the housing? How much from here ... - the devil isn't big, Taras - but the rope came off... Is ear ready? Almost done... Already the sun touched trees - but we still haven't eaten. Damn! Dear fish, why are you not boiling yet? All guests are kissed each other - but only you are cold! Akim ... Akim - forgive me! Don't leave me here! Akim! Welcome, taiga people! Your friend, all that was in his power, have done in right way. Here's - the dinner has arrived. Which time are the visitors allowed? Who can ban them? When they want, then they come. And your savior, already asked about you. He generally avoids hospitals - prefers to be treated in taiga way - uses goose fat, sauna, broom ... Release me as soon as possible - my mother in Krasnoyarsk will meet me. No. I couldn't meet father, he was urgently sent to the Sayans, together with the expedition, but I caught a cold.
