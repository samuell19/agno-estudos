...takes its way and goes the length of the floor and... Pan Am Terminal O' Hare Airport. You got it. - Could you turn that up? - Alright. Michael Jordan, 42 points, 13 off 26, from the field, with nine assist. Bulls defeat the Pistons, 108, 101 to... Well, they're gonna do it this year. That Michael Jordan can do things I've never seen any other player do in my life I mean, ever. Yeah, he's a-- a great player, but plenty of fellas came before Mike that could do things you've never seen in your life. - Like who? - I'm talking 'bout... Connie Hawkins, Elgin Baylor, Julius Erving, Dr. J in the Hawk. Yeah, I hear you. That style of play goes way back. Like David Thompson, Oscar Robinson way back, or we like, talking where the hell back? You know your basketball. Sports writing is the life for me. - Alright. - What about you? What's your excuse? I know my game. Listen, pal, we got a bit of a drive here, so, why don't you tell me more about your game? A lot of people don't know, how it went down. The highly anticipated rematch between the Globetrotters and the NBA champ Minneapolis Lakers, is turning out to be the game of the century, Marty. That's right, Howard. And even though the Lakers had a commanding lead in the first half, the trotters have come back in these exciting final minutes. Much of the damage has come from one player in particular, and that's Sweetwater Clifton, who has had a spectacular game tonight, battling against the Laker giant, George Mikan. Come on. Straight coming! Sweets! Sweets! Yeah, do that! Sweets, good job! I got mine right here. Oh, that's a foul! Ahan, aha! George Mikan gets blocked! I've never seen that before! I don't think anybody has seen that before, Howard. Attack! And it's a tie game, folks! Sweets! Boom chick-a-boom! Now! - You got to move. - Pass the ball, will you? - Move right, move right. - Pass the ball, will you? Here come the Trotters. I got my man right here. Okay, okay. What in the world is going on at mid court? Marcus Haynes is doing things with that basketball no one has done before! Here you go! Here you go! Yeah! You got it right there. Come on, Mike, get in! You're a tree! Get in his way! Oh nice, nice, nice... Irish, did you see that? Have you ever seen anything like that before? No, you haven't, because it hasn't happened prior! My boys are the best, you know that, right? Yeah, everybody knows it, Abe, especially you. - I got my man right here. - Come on, Joe. - Yes, I got him. - You got him? - Hey, hey, hey! Yeah! - We've got to... Oh, steal... Look at the size of Sweetwater's hands, he makes the ball look like a grapefruit. - Uh huh. - He could play defense. By the way, we all know that blocks and rebounds win games. Right? Yeah. Well, it's-- It's like a circus, though. It's Ringling brothers. Yeah, well, everyone's here to see that. I think there's a lot more to this cager than just blocks and rebounds. Alright. Hey, hey, hey! And the Globetrotters defeat the NBA champion, Minneapolis Lakers. Final score 49-45. Who are the champs? We're the champs! Who won this? We're the champs! We're the champs! We're the champs! We're the champs! We're the champs! Way to go, guys! Man, what a way to bring it to 'em! Now everybody knows who's the best in the world? You're gonna have to phone the missus, tell her you scored double digits tonight. Looks like you had some fun out there tonight. Always do. No, you made it look easy. Joe Lapchick. Nat Clifton. Some call me "Sweetwater". Hey, let's go, guys. Abe's waiting. And we don't wanna hear his big mouth. I coach a team called "The New York Knickerbockers". Dick McGuire is on your team? Yes, he is. He can shoot that ball. Yes, he can. Ain't no negros play in your league. That ain't no secret. It's not gonna be like that forever. I think that you can help make the change. No, no, no. No, no, I mean that. You can be the first. Great game tonight. I'll catch you later, Sweetwater. Thanks, yeah. See you around, Mr. Lapchick. Please call me "Joe". Ow! Let's see. Go to mom. - But Dad... - Go to Mom! Ow! A little bit of sugar makes the water taste so much sweeter. Come here. Come here. From this day on, your name is not Clifton Nathaniel. No more. It's Nathaniel Clifton, you understand? Yes, Momma. Okay. Now, Nat Clifton. It's time to go. But Momma... Now you listen to your momma now. Go on, and get on that horse and buggy. Hey, your Daddy taking you into the big city. Where you can have a better life. He gonna take good care of you. Yeah? But Momma, I don't wanna leave. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Take these hands, God gifted you with. You put them to good use. I always knew, you was born with a higher purpose. You just got to believe. Yeah? I love you, baby. I love you, Mom. Come. Okay, now go. Go. Hey, good game, Sweets! Good game, Sweets! Hey Sweets... Did you see Mikan's face when you blocked his shot? Fellows, we might be sleeping here tonight, but first, it's pay time. Excellent job. Thank you so very much for what you do. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you. Looking great out there, honestly and truly. -Thanks, Abe. - Thank you. - There's Pops. -Thanks, Abe. And last, but certainly not least, thank you. Ahan. What? Oh, don't give me that look, Sweetwater. You got something to say, just say it to my face. I can take it, spit it out. We beat them Lakers. The NBA champs. Yeah, we certainly did. It wasn't easy, honey. No. No, it wasn't. They're the... best. So, we didn't expect it to be easy. And if I guess it ain't my business how much they get paid? It's none of your beeswax. You're not hearing what I'm saying, Abe. I would say everyone is hearing what you're saying loud and clear. And on behalf of Sweetwater, I would like to further thank each and everyone of you out of my own. Take from tonight, 'cause you earned it. Sorry. - Alright. - Don't miss it. Extra cabbage. Fellows I got big plans more importantly, tonight's win allows us to now travel the world with your talent. South America, Europe, all the way to China. Places you've only dreamt about. Internationally known Globetrotters. Bigger than Jesse Owens. - Right? -Hmmm. -That's right. -Joe Lewis. They're just gonna be talking about you now. And I got new plays, new routines you're gonna love. And one day, one day, we're gonna be an NBA team. Get some rest. We're going to change the world, Abe. Yeah, that's right. Thanks, brother. This is your opportunity to level the playing field. Give these boys a chance and let's get them on the court! This is not a Negro league! - And never will be! Come on! -I second the - gentleman's opinion. - What are you talking about?! - Whoa, whoa, easy. - Yes, thank you. Easy! What's with all the yelling? Now, I think we should proceed with a... with an atmosphere of respect, okay. And decorum. And as for Mr. Walter Brown's inquiry regarding drafting Negro players for the Celtics, the bylaws are clear. You are not limited to whites only. It says players. Players. So, anyone of you wants to draft a negro player, go be my guest. The Celtics are very interested in drafting a negro player. - And... - Out! Alright. I'd like to speak out on behalf of my team and our interest in this league when I say it's unnecessary to have all this razzle dazzle, hot dog, and bull crap on our courts. And that's what the negro players will do. Can I-- can I just say something for a change here, okay? Just listen to me. I think I can personally guarantee that no one in this room loves basketball more than I do. Oh, come on, stop! Yes, that's right! And this stuff you call, "razzle dazzle", well, I find it exciting, and quite honestly, entertaining. Like... like a dance! - Oh, like a dance? - Yes, like a dance. Oh, it's-- it's a dance. - Yes, a dance! - Okay. Thank you very much. They're supposed to put points on the board, and paying customers in the seat. Because, basketball after all is a business. Or haven't you heard? Let's take a vote. Hm? A gentlemen's agreement if you will. I move that the NBA is for white players only. Ahh... I uh... I want to be on record to saying, that it's a mistake to go on record with that. I reiterate. I move that the NBA is for white players only. I second! Thank you. Okay, there's a motion on the table. It says uh, the NBA wants to remain an all white league. All those in favor, please say aye. - Aye! - Aye. Those opposed? Nay. You guys have it. Did you stand-- did you stand up? I tried. Of course, I did. -Did you? - What do you think? - Of course, I did. - Who-- who made the decision? - Podoloff? - Him, board of governors, - team owner-- - Oh! It was kind of unanimous, actually. The-- the NBA champs got their asses kicked by an all-negro team. Okay! Well, if memory serves me well, it was a pretty close game. Okay. If the Trotters had a franchise in this league, there isn't a team in the NBA that could beat them. I know. It's not my decision, okay? It is what it is, Joe. It doesn't have to be that way. But what do you wanna do? I'm starting to think this is where I resign. Oh, that's smart. That's really smart. Now that we have the ingredients for a championship team, you wanna quit? Huh? These kids are counting on you to take them to the finals. You wanna let them down? Go ahead, tell 'em. Go ahead. Alright, alright. - Yeah. - Okay. Alright, let's work our rebounds. Let's go, guys! Line it up. Babe! Goose! There it is. Yeah! I got him! I got him! Oh yeah, I got him, I got him. I got him! I got him! I got him! I got him! No, that's 2-2 on the whole. Whoa! What? Wait! What? Yeah, that's called "a foul". You called it on me? Yes, sir. You're 2-2. Alright, I'm sorry, Ref. - Alright. Give me the ball-- - Here you go, bud. Thank you, sir. What the hell kind of call is that? - You don't want it that way? - That's fine. It's fine. White ball. Alright. Come on, now. Hey, hey! Alright, alright. Hey, hey, hey. Keep going, keep going. Hey! Got my hat on. That damn clutch, again? No, that's the sound of an empty tank. Forgot to fill up in the city. So, I did my part tonight. So, who got bag duty, 'cause it ain't me. -Not me. - Not it. Not it. -It ain't me. - I think it's the person with the least amounts of points tonight. Yeah, so... - Who is that? -Ohhh... Ohhh! Alright, man. Alright, I'll-- I'll get the bags. That's right. Nice move. Step away, boy. You need to move away from my lily-white pumps, nigger. We mean no harm, sir. All we need is some gas, so, we can get on our way. You're a brave one talking back. You see this gun? It's loaded. I know how to use it. Let me tell you somethin'. I've used it before. Like I said, we need some gas. The tank is dry as dust. Mm-hmm. And if I let you pump some gas, how you gonna pay for it, boy? Your money ain't no good here. Well, now who doesn't love American cold hard cash, sir? Abe Saperstein at your service. Allow me to introduce the gentleman that you're somewhat pointing that, powerful looking weapon at... This is basketball legend! Nat Sweetwater Clifton. One of the stars of the Globetrotters, the world renowned Globetrotters. We just uh, need a couple of gallons of your gas, sir. We'll be on our way. In fact, I see the prices have doubled, which we're happy to pay. Youse that negro basketball team? You are a clever one, sir. Yes, we'se are except myself, of course. I coach the team. Right uh... To Jen, my girlfriend, on this side. Sure. Let me just see if there's a pen on the bus, sir. Oh, well I've got this, I do signs with. - There we are. - Here you go. That'll work. Yes, indeed. Be happy to do that. That's uh... That's gonna have some value on the open market right away, but if you hold on to it, like a piano or real estate, or a painting, that will go up in value over time. Yes, indeed. Y'all play a game today? We did! Yes, yes, a great game! And even better crowd! Weren't they something, Sweetwater? Yup, some of the better basketball fans we've seen. Good local folk you have here, sir. Yeah, but terrific local team, too, if you had the pleasure of seeing them play-- I'll tell you what? It'll be an honor of mine to provide you with the finest seats in the house for yourself. The missus and the kids, next time the Globetrotters pass through your warm and inviting county. Who won that game today? Well, who do you think won the game? Thank you for the autograph. That went well. Just get back in the bus. Uh, I'm sorry, we have absolutely no rooms available. You have no rooms? This is our busiest time of year. Yeah, I can see that. A lot of keys there behind you. You sure you don't wanna take one more look to see if there are any rooms? Ah, it'd be a waste of time, sir. I'll tell you what, you should check out The Dunbar. They're right across town. I'm sure they'd be willing to accommodate you. Across town, huh? Yeah. What about him? Is he at the Dunbar, too? Oh no. He's here, sir. - What? - Yeah, Mr. Bananas, he's-- he's staying with us. Yeah, he's just working at the theatre - right across the street. - Is that right? - Yeah. - And he's got his own room here? Well, he... Him and his trainer. Sure. Somebody's got to order the room service, right? Let me see if I understand this. Mr. Bananas, this chimp is so talented, he's named after the food he eats, whereas my fellas, who are the most talented basketball players in the world, they've got no room here. Look uh, I don't make the rules, okay? Times like this... Hmmm. ...wish the hell I did. Yeah, you don't make the rules. You just follow 'em, like at Nuremberg. Does that ring a bell? Let's go, fellas. Wish you luck. That was very yummy, mom. I'm so glad you liked it, sweetie. Dad, may I be excused? It's okay. Have never seen you so distraught. It's the wall. What wall? Ugh. That Sweetwater Clifton represents everything that I have been fighting for, you know that. The guy is the future of basketball, and there is this wall, that the league built, and he won't be able to break through it. Alright? By the time he does, we'll be grandparents. Look at me. You are Joe Lapchick. Yeah. You don't have to break through a wall. You just go get Sweetwater, and you climb over that wall with him. I don't remember ordering room service. I didn't mean to wake you. No, no, that's okay. I don't ever really sleep. Ah, well, at least your team is awake. Right? We should take this up to the Catskills. Saperstein and Lapchick, some Lapshtick, right? - That's good. - You know? To what do I owe the pleasure? Listen, I know you're not fully conscious, but I would just love to pitch you something. If you got a minute. Ah, bring the Globetrotters back to the garden. I don't think so. Huh. They'll sell it out again. No, we sold out, because it was the NBA champion Lakers playing the Trotters, for an unofficial world championship. It was a bragging rights, Joe. The fans did not come out to see the Lakers. They paid their money to see the Trotters, 'cause that's great entertainment. Other than the Ringling brothers, we don't sell tickets, you know that. Trotters sell out everywhere they go. Yeah, in the boondocks, Joe. Tiny gyms. This is no comparison to the garden. - This is Ned. -Hi Ned, it's Mickey. Oh hey, Mickey, what's going on? What if the Trotters played an All-Star college team? That will put the butts in the seats. Hold on, Mickey. I don't wanna talk to that Saperstein guy. Already taken care of. Thanks, boss. Go ahead, Mickey. That's it, fellas. Steal the rhythm. Boom chick-a-boom chick-a-boom. Yes! -Oh yeah! -Alright! Hit it. Show some magic. - Go ahead, Michael -Go ahead, man! Now that's entertainment. Basketball as its finest. And skills. Skills. Ringling brothers. Yeah, it comes in handy though. Believe me, and by the way, people love it. All that and they can actually play. It's just a lot of fancy stuff. Yeah, but it sells, you know it does. No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't just finger roll it in, around the back or something, and then stuff it. Razzle dazzle! Remember that! That's what the fans pay for. Don't start playing white on, you're gonna put them to sleep. Five-minute break, and I mean, five! Hey, you pay no mind to Sap. You go over there and handle your business. You're gonna see, he's a great kid. Just try not to scare him. I want you to meet Ned Irish. He owns the Knickerbockers, and the Garden. No fooling, huh? Nice to meet you, Mr. Irish. Great to meet you too, Nat. Hey, let me see those hands. Oh, wow. Well, welcome back to the Garden. Uh, yes sir, thank you. No, what's with this sir stuff? Call me "Ned". Sorry. Just a habit left over from my days in the army. You fought in the war? Yes sir, Joe. - Here, have a seat. -Have a seat. Saperstein's a little tough on you, huh? He knows what he wants. Yeah. He wants a show, that's what he wants. Abe's got to win all the time. That's what we get paid to do. However, much that is. And I'm telling you, it ain't much. So uh, you win all the time and you get paid for it? Sounds like a champagne problem to me. It ain't like that, Mr. Irish. You see, Abe sets up these games with white players for us to win. What gets me is why set it up, when we're better than all these white teams, that can beat 'em anyways. It's not like he's asking you to take a dive in the 12th round. You see, Mr. Irish, we do things with this basketball, don't even exist in your dreams. And I get people paying for that. But I ain't interested in being part of no circus. Okay, nap time's over. We got a big game tonight. A bunch of college idiots who can't wait to get their butts kicked. Let's go. Sweets! Yeah! Sweetwater! Okay, Caleb and Andrew, I want you guys out there double-teaming Sweetwater. But every time we step on this court, - it means something. - Right. So, let's make these last seconds count. - Mm-hmm. - Hey. I got something up my sleeve. Wa-- wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait. Hehe. Thank you! It worked, man. Alright, man, I'll tell you after a win like that, I'm going out tonight. Looking like Superman with them shoulder pads on. Where we going tonight? If you want to meet the fellows, you just need to tell me. Later. Okay fellas, grab your stuff. Let's get on the bus. - Here we go! -Irish. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. Good to see you there, Mr. Irish. Great game, great game. You make sure there's money out there... It really is your lucky day. How lucky am I? About 2 grand lucky. You're not so bad after all, Irish. Wish I could say the same about you, Abe. What about the other team? Took care of them from my end. Like we agreed. - 100 shekels each? -100 a man. - Paid in full. - Alright, I gotta skedaddle. We got another show upstate in the boonies. Looks like you're working too hard. Oh, if I had your money, I'd give mine away. Huh. Special place, isn't it? Oh yeah. She is beautiful. Yeah. I won a couple of championships here with St John's. - Oh, I know. - Yeah. Yeah. Let's see what you're made of. Try to get one past me. You'll need to take that coat off though. - You wanna play me? - Yes, sir. Oh, come on. You serious? Yeah, I couldn't be more serious. Alright. Come on, I know what you're thinking. I know what you're thinking. That you're taller, and stronger, and a better athlete. Better looking. Longer arm reach, bigger hands. But you... You cannot get one pass me. Alright. - Hold on, Joe. Hold on. - Oh, I think you're-- - wait a minute. - Now hold on, Joe. - That was a foul, Joe. - No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, - you're thinking it was? - It's-- it's a foul, Joe. No, no, it was-- There was not a foul. - You did forget something. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Oh, now the coat comes off. - Alright. Give me the ball. Okay. Too much Godzilla, come on, Joe. - Oh! - Come on, Joe. No, no, no. That uh... It happens every once in a while. - Come on, Coach. - You know what? I wasn't warmed up kid. I warm up, that doesn't happen. Okay. You're gonna walk away? - That's it. -It's okay. You're scared, I get it. Oh, no, I think, you just need a little more practice. Joe, Joe, Joe. Old clutch finally gave out. I'll get a mechanic by the morning. But we ain't going anywhere tonight. Night. What took you so long, Sweets? A lot of miles you and me, huh? I'm going for a walk... I mean, I can't really complain, can I? Where the hell are you going? Oh, mind your business, Abe. Kitchen's closed. You need to leave. I said, you need to leave. It's okay. He's with me. Okay, come on. Good evening, sir. What can I get for you? Yeah, uh, another Bourbon for me and uh, make it a double for my friend.

You know, we could change that. I know if you pay me right, maybe we could win a championship. I'd pay anything to see the look on Abe's face, if you left. Nothing more tempting than freedom.

How much is this gonna be? $5? $10? You know what? Don't answer that. It's a trick question. Alright, half court offence. Here we go, boys. Here we go. Here we go, okay. McGuire, what are you doing? Okay, keep it moving. Extra pass. Extra pass. What are you-- Hold on a second. If we keep coming without the ball, let's go again, alright. Give and go. As soon as you give it, just make that cut. Make-- Don't ever stop. -Okay. -This doesn't stop. Let's go, let's go. Movement. Make that cut. There we go. Okay. Perfect. Alright? That's how it's done. There's more options from the post. - Who's that? - Oh, look at that. Good to see you, Joe. You too, Sweetwater. Give me the ball. Alright, fellas, same play. Set it up. Max, Vandeweghe, criss cross right there. McGuire, cut now! Hey. Yeah! Nice layout! Nice shot. Not bad for a bunch of white guys. Now, that's a well-coached team. Hmm. That's a well. Thanks for this one, fellas. - Absolutely. - See you around, Joe. Hey Joe, can I have a word, please? Alright, guys, come on. Give me a second, guys. Um, what do you think you're doing? What are you talking about? You do realize letting him play is a violation of league policy? No. League policy says that you can't draft a player of color. It doesn't say that you can't practice. Oh, come on, Joe. No one moves like Sweetwater. No one, no one posts up like him. No one can pass. Maybe Cousy, but he's not 6'8". Sweetwater is an older player. And more importantly, you're forgetting that he's a... A negro? We could win a title with that negro. He'd make a great Knickerbocker. That's just my two cents. Thank you. Alright, guys. Let's hit the shower. Good work today. Let's go, fellows. Look, I know that the league and the owners are gonna fight you on this to no end-- - Huh. - But I want this. I want it bad, Ned. Alright? You saw it was sellout crowd, right? The fans are gonna eat it up. Yeah, well, have you ever thought of the fact that maybe Sweetwater's best years might be behind him? Oh, come on, that's-- You know that's not true. We all know that's not true. Look, Sweetwater knows this game better than anyone, young or old. You know how long, and how hard I have fought to break down barriers? I will fight for this. I wanna fight with you. It's not an easy mountain to climb, Joe. Yeah, we'll climb it together. Could get ugly. I was born ugly. - Thanks very much. -You're welcome. - Take care of yourself. -Thank you. Hey, Saperstein. Great game yesterday. About that, listen I'm glad I saw you. I wanted to thank you for the accommodations your urine-soaked alleyway has been very nice to me. You're welcome, anytime. So uh, I think this belongs to you. What? We settled up last night. New day new deal. Yeah, but what is it? It's about 5,000 in cash. What? Why? Why? Well, it's not a raise. I want to buy Sweetwater's contract. I like you, Irish. You're funny. Did you talk to Sweets about this? - Not really, no. - No, didn't think so. I should keep this cash to pay for the insult. - It's not happening. - Why? I thought you'd be interested in getting rid of a headache. Yeah, it's quite the headache I get from counting all the money he makes me. Forget it. Let me ask you something. You don't really think Sweetwater's gonna play in the NBA? Lapchick, I understand, he wants to move the color line and I respect that, but what is your angle? I don't know. Fill the Garden, win a couple of championships, maybe. - For the glory? - For the glory. - Why not? - Okay. I just don't see you spending a dime on a negro player, when you know the league will never let him play. 'Cause of the rules. I like breaking the rules. You did pretty good with no Jew, especially one with five negros, will ever play in the Garden. - Did I say that? - That's a quote. - Oh. - This is not happening - in your lifetime. - Okay. I mean, I can't change your mind at all. I mean, think about it, you get to sleep in a real bed, with real sheets, not on the floor of a bus. Come on! - Sheets? - Sheets. What kind of sheets? Egyptian cotton, you're gonna love it. You son of a bitch. - Get out of here. - Ah, you're a f-- You're the funny one, Saperstein. You know I like you, you know that? Why don't you call me, when you get back from the boondocks? - Okay? - It's not enough. Okay. Okay. You guys are looking good with the matching uniforms, and fancy shoes. Alright. Here we are, Ref. Alright. Count it, boys. Should be 75 shekels a piece in there for you. I counted it myself, now, let's go over the game plan, shall we? You play along with the shenanigans on the court. The Trotters win, and everything works out for everybody. Easy, right? Any questions? No? Great! - Alright! - Mr. Saperstein? - Yeah! - I just want to say this is so generous. Right, right, yeah, yeah. Let's not count it out here. It's Saperstein, yeah. Okay. Sweet! What are you doing, pal? Come on, we got a game in five minutes. You ready? What's the matter? Oh, buddy, come on, we're gonna have some fun. Boom chick-a-boom. Here we go. Alright, alright, you got him. Here we go. Yeah! Alright, alright. Hey!! Okay, okay, I got it, I got it. Hey! Between your legs! Over your head, ah! Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it! Yeah! Just wait a minute. Who believes in magic? I do! I do! Me! What is this? What's happening? Hey Sap! Just sit back and enjoy the magic. Right. Oh, I think I see somebody. Excuse me. - Come. -Oh, now, wait second. Just go with it. Come on, now, you show me the magic. All you gotta do is believe. Do I gotta pay the kid now? Didn't that feel good? That felt great. Alright, let's wrap it up. Hold on, fellas! What's the score? Hey man, it's a little bit to a lot. Well, let's make it a little bit more funny. What you talking about, Sweet? Follow me. You're scoring on the other team's basket. I'm gonna count on it. I'm gonna count-- That's for you guys. Yes. They just made you get this. These are all counting. Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going. Okay, that's 60! That's enough. Now hold on now. Goose! It's tied up. Whoa! And we only have three seconds left. Everybody! 3, 2, 1. You better make that. And a regulation, that shot counts, Harlem wins by 2. Yeah, thanks. Wow. Oh, absolutely. Sweetwater, what the hell was that about? Well, that's entertainment. That's what you pay me to do. No, I pay you to stick to my game plan. We won. Just like you planned. Scoring baskets for the other team was never part of my plan. It never will be. Okay, Abe. But I heard you say something about some shenanigans. Yeah. On the bus now! Let's go! Let's go! - Thanks, everybody. - Yeah. We gotta go. Bus leaves in five minutes with or without you, and I mean five. Let's go, let's go. - Thanks, folks. - What's your name? Hey, that bit with the kid, now that is entertainment. Special, Sweets. Keep doing your thing. Hmm. - Thank you, Pop. - Yeah. Thank you, ma'am. I love the hat. - What a finish. -Yes. You signed them autographs, Goose? Thanks, man. Pretty good game. Yeah, thank you. Great game indeed. - Fantastic. - Thanks Abe. Great job. Fantastic. Fans loved that. -Wonderful. -It's great. Yeah, I see that right. Say Marcus, how much you got? - Hm? - 50. Goose, you? 50. Pop? Oh, I see what's going on. Come on now, how much you got? That'll be 50. 50! Yeah, me too. Tell the boys how much you pay the other team, Abe. Hm. Is there a problem? We whipped their butts! And they get paid more than we do. Now that sound right. Does it, fellas? No, no. Them white boys get paid more to lose, than we get paid to win. I mean I don't know, maybe I should switch teams. - No. -Come on. Make a little extra cabbage next time. Big question is, how much are you making, Abe? Oh, you were but a babe, when I created this team. Hell, when I turned the Savoy Big Five into the Harlem Globetrotters, you were just starting to walk. I created this team. I named this team. I sowed the costumes you're wearing. Most importantly, I'm your boss. I'm the reason this team exists! I'm the reason it's such a success. Why do I do this everyday? For you! I do whatever it takes to get your next meet. To get you the recognition for what you do better than any other human being on this planet, which is play basketball. There's nobody better. So just, stick to playing basketball. That's what you do. This ain't about basketball, Abe. We're just part of your circus, man. I mean you say, nobody does it better than us. We beat the world champs, man. We feel we can beat any team anywhere, fair and square. Listen, Abe, all we's saying is, you can pay the other team. but don't you pay 'em to lose? That take away all the fun out of whipping their butts! - That's right. - Yes! Right, yeah. Okay. Fine. You need me to remind you what I thought everyone in this bus, thoroughly understood. As a negro, you will not play professional basketball, unless you play for me. This is my team. I don't care who you are. Nobody, especially you, is gonna tell me how to run it! I got big plans for you, fellas. A barn? Wow. What now? It's nice to see you too, Abe. Come on, someone wants to say hi to you. Well, I can't imagine what brought you two city folks all the way out here to the boondocks. Abe. You're wasting your time and mine. You know, it beats the hell out of me, what got into you, putting together a group of negro basketball players. From Timbuktu Illinois, you got the whole world, thinking you guys are from Harlem. And now you're the best team on the planet. Greatest thing that ever happened to basketball. I recognize the brilliance in you, Abe. We're here to finish what you started. A negro basketball player will walk on to an NBA court, so help me God. What do you think about that, Irish? You think that's gonna happen? Don't be a sap, Saperstein. How much does it ring? Huh. I'm starting to like this guy more than I thought I would. In this envelope, is my final offer. 10,000 sheckles as you call it. Now, that's more money than anyone will pay for a negro player. And I'm certain, that you'll make sure, Sweets gets some of it. Don't even think about it, that's my car. You're never getting my car, Abe. What do they call that? What? When someone comes into an unexpected good fortune. Luck of the Irish? That's it! Irish, today's your lucky day. I'm gonna take your $10,000. You're gonna take Sweetwater back with you in that beautiful jalopy. But when you get there, you're gonna find another 2500 in cash, that you'll give to Sweetwater, so he can get on his feet, while he waits for his big Knickerbocker salary to kick in. That's my final offer. Okay. You're all out of excuses, Abe. How about that? How about that? What do you know? Hey Irish, I got this idea, if a player can sink at basket for much, much further than normal, much further out than normal, he should get more than two points. I call it a "three-pointer". What do you think? Phew. Jazz up the game a little? I don't know, it sounds pretty crazy, Abe, but I don't know if the league will ever go for it. Run it by Podoloff. You run it by Podoloff. What am I, your errand boy? Oh, for he-- I'm gonna remember that. This guy. Hey, Irish. - Yeah? - Promise me you'll fight for Sweetwater to get enough playing time, so the NBA can see what he can actually do. Yeah, sure. - We got Sweetwater. - Yeah, thank you. Hey, hey, listen up. Made a decision. Sweetwater, that was your last game wearing a Trotter uniform. Oh, come on, Abe. Come on, he's just messing around. Hey, I was just having some fun out there. You know, I didn't mean no harm by that. Yeah, your nonsense on the court had nothing to do with my decision. You're done here. Ned Irish just bought your contract from me. So, your next game will be in a Knick jersey. - Huh. -The famed New York Knickerbockers, has just hired Sweetwater Clifton with a starting salary of $2,500, and I am the Jewish Abe Lincoln. You are free to play in the NBA. Hey, come on, I'm representing all of us, huh. Got some. Take me with you. Love you, brother. Welcome to the Knickerbockers, Sweetwater. Thank you, Mr. Irish. You ready to change the game? Oh, I was born ready. I believe it. - Come on, let's go. - Alright. Welcome. Thank you, coach. No, no. Sweetwater, in the front. It's okay. Oh, okay. But Irish, you know you can't play him. Huh. The hell I can't, and you can bet I will. I like to think of him as the uh, as the Jackie Robinson of the NBA. Irish, when you put a colored player on the court, a white player is sitting on the bench. Which America are you living in, joker? 'Cause your head is so far up your ass, you forgot what the land of the free, and the home of the brave, stands for. Mm-hmm. Okay, uh, excuse us for one second, please? Come here, come here. You gotta help me out. I got a board here, who thinks, that you're violating the decree. I'm talking about the future of the game here, Mo. Now, we can either stand in the way of progress, or we can be a part of it. You proceed with a separate agenda like this, you're gonna start a war. And I'll fight it with you. - Okay, as I was saying- - Okay, ah, excuse me. Ah, what-- what my colleague over here is trying to say is that he thinks, that Sweetwater's style of play is going to be uh, disrespectful to his fans. - Exactly. - Wrong again, my distinguished colleagues. Sweetwater's style is pure showmanship. And the fans love it. That's why he's a big draw! That's right. This league, our league, is not gonna survive. Not with this vanilla style of play. We need some of that, what'd you call it? "Razzle dazzle"? Razzle dazzle, indeed. - Wh-- what's he doing here? - Just hear him out. Thanks, boss, I appreciate it. Hey, Joe. Gentlemen, I will be very brief. Sweetwater Clifton's style of play, is creative. It's innovative. And it brings about a much needed change to this game. I know change is hard for you gentlemen, but this is the game, that is-- that is being played on the streets. It's being played in colleges. The street game in college plays, it's not the pro ranks, Lapchick. It's the future... - Oh... -...Of the NBA. Look, we already took a vote, Ned. Yeah well, the fans didn't vote that way. Let me ask you a question. Who sells more tickets than any other basketball team? Go ahead, take a guess, go ahead. We all know it's the Trotters, Irish. That's right. And since it's been decided by the board of governors, to not let the Trotters have a franchise in this league, I say, we all draft great negro players and put 'em on our teams. How about one each, huh? We each pick one player. I mean, how hard is that? It's what the fans want. That's New York fans. You don't know my fans. What we're trying to get through to you, it's that times change. You know, it wasn't too long ago, that a Jew wasn't permitted to set foot on a hardwood, never mind own a team. Now, I have three Jewish players on my roster. So, what I'm trying to say to you is, schmuck! Don't be a schmuck! Look, no matter how you feel about this, - it's good for business. - Now, you're talking. Irish, let's say that I go along with your letting negros into the league program, what does that make me? Does that make me your friend? You know what this is? Huh? You see that? That, is my gate take for the Knickerbocker season. The whole season, $1, That'll buy you a hot dog and an orange drink. on me. Be my guest. Irish, why are you fighting so hard for this negro player? Because he fought for us. Sergeant Sweetwater Clifton is a veteran of the United States Army. Sounds pretty distinguished to me. So uh, shall we continue with the draft? Okay, uh, next up is the Celtics' Walter Brown. The Boston Celtics pick Chuck Cooper from Duquesne. We all know we allow colored players into the draft, but by gentlemen's agreement, we don't actually select them. He's eligible for the draft, isn't he? Yeah. Well, then, I don't care if he's striped, plaid, polka dot, the Boston Celtics pick Chuck Cooper from Duquesne. Okay, next up. Washington Capitals. Mr. McKinney. The Washington Capital select Earl Lloyd, West Virginia State. Okay, look, I'm not telling you again, you cannot draft negros! Have you seen this guy play? Have you seen any of these guys play? We have rules, Podoloff. Maybe I want a negro on my team, huh? You're too late. You should've made a motion before. -What happened today... -Alright. Hey, hey, hey. Over here, Earl. Mr. Cooper! Mr. Cooper! -One right here. -Mr. Clifton! Philadelphia Post, Mr. Lloyd, we'll start with you. How does it feel to be competing to become the first color player? To play in the NBA? Oh man, um... I'm just a small town kid, man, um, you know. I'll be lying to you, man, if I-- if I didn't tell you that it is, it's quite frightening. Right. Thank you. Mr. Cooper? Same question. I can say, I probably feel how Jackie Robinson felt a couple of years ago. Um, for me, this is a dream come true. I grew up playing basketball. and now I get to play at the highest level. And to get paid to do what I love. It's-- it's crazy. Mr. Clifton, before signing with the Knicks, you were a basketball star in your right. And some say, the best basketball player in the world. And now, you're in the NBA. What's going through your mind? I don't think it's about who's the best. Yeah, see. Ever since I was a young boy, I always felt like I'm adapting. My whole life's been like that. That's something we get from our parents to survive. I believe that the three of us, Chuck Cooper, Earl Lloyd, and myself can walk away from the past.

My friends at school say we're nigger lovers. Is that true? Son, that is a word of disrespect. And we don't ever use that word in this household, ever. You understand? Never again, never again. I understand, dad. Nice shot. Nice shot. Wait till you see this kid. Come on. Put it up, put it up. Watch this guy. Hey, hey, newest New York Knick. Don't know how you missed that free though. You're an All-Star, right? Having an off night, you know how that goes? Oh... Me, I can't afford to have an off night. And I especially can't afford to miss any free throws. They're free. I like this guy, he's fun. Alright, come on now. Let me show y'all something. Over there, McGuire. Max, Vandeweghe. Vince. You keep it. I'll take that, Mr. Clifton. Alright. Alright, pass to Vandeweghe, criss cross in front of me. Oh, no. Hold on. Stop, stop. Go back. Go back to him. You see this ball? This ball has life. You can't just treat it any kind of way. You got to cherish it. Give it your best. Put some love in it. And watch what it give you back. So, don't just pass the ball any kind of way, put some love in it. You got to cherish it. Right. Just like that, snap it! No. On target. Have a goal. Accomplish it. Right, put some love on it. The man is taking control. Yeah. á* Free for Vandeweghe. Oh! Don't worry about it, you'll get the hang of it. What are you guys talking about it? His pass is way more faster than you. Alright, gentlemen. Enough clowning around. Max, let's run up some plays. A little half court offense. Let's go, gentlemen. Okay. Keep it, keep it moving. Find the extra pass. Get that momentum. Get that-- okay. Alright. I'm telling you, Mo, this story is big. All the radio and the news... Oh come on, come on. Everybody likes good press. The attention's good for everyone. Not everyone. Ah, that's nothing. All these guys, they're gonna fall into line, once they see the fans in the seats. Just to admit to me, this is causing some serious problems. You met the man. Now that I know which one he is. No, but you've never met him, right? No, I haven't met him, but he's in the middle practice. Well, let's go say hi to him. Come on, let's go say hi. Well, he's busy. I don't wanna break his concentration-- Mo, Mo, he's not gonna bite you, okay. Hey Sweets, I want you to meet the President of the League. This is Maurice Podoloff. Mo, meet Nat Sweetwater Clifton. Mr. Podoloff, a pleasure, sir. Ah. Sergeant, it is my honor. Oh, listen, it's... It's nice to be here. Actually, before I forget, this is yours. A check, to a colored man? That'll bounce higher than a basketball. - Right. - Ah. If we could figure out a cash situation. Thank you, Sergeant, for bringing it to our attention. And I want to tell you how happy we are that it's you, who's breaking the color line in the NBA. Earl Lloyd scores a basket, and makes history. And he becomes the first negro player to play in the NBA. Someone's here early. Oh, going to get some shots up, you know, get stretched out and all. How about little one-on-one rematch? I don't think you want that, - coach. - I was trying - to kill your confidence. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Have you guys seen today's paper? Huh? Here, read, read. What the hell's going on? Earl Lloyd played for the Capitals last night in Rochester. In Rochester, for crying out loud! "Earl Lloyd... ...his first game in the NBA. His appearance also marked - the first time..." - Yeah. "...a negro man played in the new NBA league, overshadowing tonight's game in the New York..." I don't under... The season starts tonight. Yeah, supposed to, should have. Didn't! Listen, that's good for Earl Lloyd. I think I know who's responsible for this. Hey Mo, what's this uh, October 31st game in Rochester crap, huh? It's not even a regular season game. According to the official NBA schedule, the season starts tonight. November 1st, in the Garden! Yeah, not this year, Ned. "Oh, don't worry, Ned. I got your back. I'll fight your war for you." Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure! Hey! Hey! Just for the record, the president has every right to change the schedule at his discretion. It's in the bylaws. Look it up. Why'd you do it, Mo? Why? Why? There was a prediction of a severe weather storm in Rochester tonight! So, I changed the schedule. Oh, what a load of bull. Yesterday, was great for the league. No! It was fantastic for the league! But that was supposed to be Sweetwater's moment! Tonight! In my Garden! In New York! Everybody knew that! You knew that! You took it away from the game! From the fans! But more importantly, you took it away from Sweetwater. Too much power for one negro. Too big a moment for the bozos, right? Hey. There's nothing I can do about predicting the weather. Oh, don't give me that crap, Mo! New York City is center stage! The impact here would have been heard everywhere. Just level with me. Give me a reason. You just heard it, you just said it, you just heard it. Change is happening. But I don't know that my city can take it, do you? Are you sure? I don't care about uh... confusion in Rochester. Who cares? But Madison Square Garden, in the middle of Manhattan? You want blood on the floor? You want rioting on Madison Square Garden? Huh, I don't-- I don't want that. I don't want that. Is that a good enough reason for you? So, Earl Lloyd, Rochester, he-- he gets to make history, and we got what? Nothing. Sweetwater gets nothing. Because of what? Some-- some freaking scheduling glitch. Some, some freaking history making. History-making scheduling glitch. You gonna play Sweetwater tonight? What if I do? Dangerous, could be trouble. I certainly hope so. Save me a seat. I wouldn't miss it for the world. And tonight marks Nat Sweetwater Clifton's first game as an NBA player. That remains to be seen, if Clifton can really complete in the NBA. Set the tone early. Fundamental basketball. Leave your heart on that court. Sweet, you're starting. Hey, that's Sweetwater! And this is the moment we've all been waiting for. History in the making. Folks, I wish you could see what I'm seeing right now. The emotion on Sweetwater's face and the crowd here looking at Clifton, there is history in the air here at the Garden. That's a travel. Indianapolis ball. Good call, good call. Rebound, rebound. Rebound. Rebound. There we go. Break it. On the break. Beautiful. Yeah! No! No basket! That's a travel. Blue ball. What are you talking about, Donnie? What are you calling here? Good call, Donnie. Come on. That's a foul, number eight New York. Olympian ball. Olympians with the ball. It's up, it's good. A good start for the Olympians. What a great move. Open there. Get it to Sweets. Out of bounds, on the Knicks, and Sweetwater continues to struggle in these opening minutes of the game, folks. Oh yeah! That's it. That's what we're looking for. Come on, guys. We gotta put past. There you go. McGuire passes to Gallatin, hook shot, and it's no good. -It's okay, kid. -Oh! Sweetwater goes down hard. Oh my goodness, I hope he's not injured. That's a foul. Get the pass. There you go. There you go, keep it moving. Get back on team. Get back on team. Come on, Sweets. And the Olympians score, as they continue to build on their league. There we go, there we go. And here's Sweetwater, with a little razzle dazzle. A beautiful move to the basket, and it's good! Let's go. Giddy up, giddy up. Yeah! Hold on. What was that, Howard? I think that was a new kind of shot. Looked like a donut being dunked in a cup of coffee. Let's call it a "dunk". What's going on? Was that... I got it, I got it. Alright, that's gonna be a technical foul. No basket, no basket. Indianapolis ball. Technical foul? -Yeah. - No, no basket? Did you miss me doing this? This is no basket. I don't understand, but what is the actual call? They did not do a basketball move. This is just because, you didn't-- you've never seen it before, doesn't make it illegal. We got a technical foul. In number eight of the New York Knicks. - Tell me what the call is. - Get off the court! Get behind the line! You're-- you're out of line, Donnie! Here we go. Technical foul! All the coach in the Knicks have it. That's a ridiculous call! - You don't know... - I did not want to do this, Joe. I did not wanna do it. I didn't wanna do it! Did not want to do it. Let's go. We're gonna... You have to stop with the hotdogging. You think there's an outside chance it was a bad call, Joe? Have a seat. Simmons in for Sweetwater. - Coach-- - Don't-- don't even give them a reason. Don't give 'em a reason. Have a seat. Thank you. Simmons, get in there for Sweetwater. Let's go. Back out there. -Alright, let's go. -Keep it up, don't stop moving. Well, it looks like Sweetwater's gonna be benched. It's clear to the fans here anyway, that his flashy game, is throwin' a curve ball into the NBA. Here we go. McGuire passes to Gallatin. Hook shot. It's good! Back on D. There we go. Here come the Olympians. And they score again. Keep it moving. Get that rebound. Vandeweghe misses the shot. Back on team! That my friends, marks the end of the first half. Look, okay, let's not beat ourselves up. Alright? Let-- hey! Let's not get down! Let's not get down! Take a breath, everybody. Fundamentals. That's what wins games. That's what wins championships. Alright, take a beat. Be smart. Find the open man. Take that extra pass, that's alright, and find our rhythm offensively. That's it. Don't get in our own way. - Alright. - Show me some fundamentals out there! Let's go guys! Let's go, Sweets. I know we can do this! - We can do this! - Let's go, Sweets. Come on. This is the half that matters. Come on, it's a whole new ball game. Let's go. I get one more technical foul, and I'm out, right? Yeah, you're out. That's why you're not gonna get a technical foul. You're gonna get 30 points. Let's go. See, when you first come to me, you were talking about change. I still believe in that. Change I'm talking about, though is changing the game. You see, this ain't about the color of my skin no more. It's about what I do. And how I do it. It's about being true to the game of basketball. And right now, you've seen it with your own eyes. My game don't belong here. My game belong on the streets. Not in the NBA. Figures. Oh, wonder if I can convince Abe to give me my 12,500 back? Oh, cut the gas! 12,5? For my ass? Damn! It's uh, it's not about the money, Sweets. Never was. - I'll see you on the court. - Yeah. And if you're feeling up to breaking the scoring record, we're down by 17. Yeah! Go! Let's go! Nat Clifton, in my office. Right. I gotta tell you, that that was one of the most incredible performances on the basketball court that I've ever seen. As much as I loved it, don't you ever do that again! Huh? They don't like your style. Your hotdogging bigger style. Even though it's full of grace, they don't like it. They want you to maybe grab a rebound, block a shot or two. Yes, win the game. But just not like how you did it today. And then when they get off your back, and let you stand up straight, the world would then be able to see what you do. We're five minutes into the second half of play, folks, and there's still no sign of Sweetwater Clifton. That's beautiful. Excellent! And the Olympians score again! Vandeweghe shoots and scores! Sweetwater has finally rejoined his team on the bench. Sweets, let's go. Come on, here we go! And Sweetwater Clifton is coming back into the game, folks. Ball! Ball! Yeah, get it, go. Ah. How do you like them apples? That's why I like it. Get inside, get inside and rebound. Let's go! Clifton blocks the shot! No! Foul on number eight on the Knicks! What are you talking about? That was the best freakin' block ever. Right here. Inches away. - Watch out. - Alright. It's alright. - Alright. - Sweetwater Clifton has just been handed his fourth foul of the game. One more, and it's bye bye, Sweetwater. And now Coach Lapchick has to make the inevitable move and pull Sweetwater out of the game. It's back to the bench for Sweetwater. Get that extra pass. Don't back down. Get that rebound. Get a rebound. Another miss. Get back on D, everyone. Get back on D. What are you doing? Get back on D. The Knicks, unable to score, as the Olympians - extend their league. -Alright, that's it. We're getting a time-out. Time-out. Time-out. New York. There's a time-out on the floor. Don't ever give up on a play! I don't know what you're doing. Now-- Wh-- what happened to our defense, okay? We're gonna run some pick and rolls from McGuire. - Coach-- - Don't stop... what? We're a much better team with Sweets in there. Listen, coach, you put me on that floor, all focus goes on me. We can use that to our advantage, alright? - Let us take this game over! - Alright. You heard the man, let's go. Come on, guys. Let's go, let's go. Hey! Vandeweghe! Vandeweghe passes to Sweetwater. McGuire... - Whooo! -And score. Nice, nice. Get that rebound! Oh! Here, Vandeweghe! Clear it out! Give it down to Sweets. To Sweets, to Sweets. Let's go. - There you go. -Sweetwater grabs the rebound, and makes his way down the court. Stay out of the paint. Get that rebound. Yeah. McGuire! McGuire, back to me. Vandeweghe! Hey Sweets, give it here! Into the mouth, there we go. Alright, it's okay. Yeah, it's as if the basketball gods have flipped the switch, Marty. And Howard, the Olympians have no idea how to deal with this. Neither do the Refs! Hey Mo, what do you think? What do I think? I think there's not an empty seat in the whole damn hall. That's right. We sold more tickets than Ringling brothers. Stay with it. Focus up. Aah! Sweetwater goes down. Look at that. What'd you say to me? Huh? Foul, foul. We've got a full-scale fight right on the floor. It's okay, it's okay. Just scared of you. It's okay, it's okay. - That boy... - He's just scared of you. It's alright, it's okay. That ain't basketball! - You don't know basketball! - Joe, Joe. Hey, hey, hey, it's nothing. I got this. This is a crucial moment in the ball game. If it goes the other way, Clifton is out. Alright, we got a personal foul. A number 11 on the Knicks. The foul was on Gallatin. Two shot Blue. It's gonna be number 11. It's not gonna go on Sweetwater Clifton. He will stay in the ball game. The Knicks just dodged a huge bullet right there. Let's go, let's go. Now we got two shots. Oh, don't you miss. It's free. Oh. I just need one more. And the Knicks have the ball. Hey, Vandeweghe! Vandeweghe into Sweetwater. He's looking around. He's gonna take the ball himself. The basket's good. I got a foul on 15 Blue. You got one shot. Out of this world, what a game. This one's for the books, Howard. Seconds to play, and we've got ourselves a barn burner, Marty. Here's the free throw. Yes! Switch, switch, switch. The Olympians attempting a hotdog. And Sweetwater steals the ball. Time-out. Time-out. Time-out. Come on, come on. There's a time-out on the floor. What are the Knicks gonna do now? We're talking about just a few seconds left. Strategy is everything right now. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to give it to the truth, at the top of the key. Alright? And then you're gonna clear out of the way. Give it to him. Come on, let's go. Alright, we got 10 seconds. Let's do it! 10 seconds! Let's go, Knicks. Let's go. And the Knicks have the ball. Sweetwater at the top of the key. Nine seconds left. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The Knicks have won the game. 72-71, the final score. What a finish, folks! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Sweetwater! Great game, Sweetwater. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. I can't believe this. I'm sitting here riding in a cab with the Nat Sweetwater Clifton. People don't know, man. They don't know that when they're watching an NBA game, they're watching you play your game, they're watching Sweetwater. You lit that torch. No, uh, it ain't like that. I uh... I'm a small part of it all. Just a messenger. You definitely delivered. Big time. Thank you. I rather enjoyed the ride. Me too. 01:48:44,039 People don't know, man.
