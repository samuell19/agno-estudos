Man: I'm about to invest over $3 million in this project. The toughest job will be entering through those hills into the valley. - And we'll be tunneling aàthrough, won't we? - Yes, sir. And trestle over that area there. Ah yes, and when we've finished, cattle from every part of the state will be transported here, grazed on those hills, fattened and expressed east. New beef for our growing cities. Now that's progress. You seem concerned, miss jeffreys. Your railroad will go right through those vineyards, Mr. Berrigan. A great deal of hard work went into clearing that land and making it profitable. [ Man singing in Italian ] Maria, Anna, make sure Marco isn't late today. Morning, papa. You look nice. Maria! [ Speaks Italian ] Si, papa. Marco. Mama. Oh, Marco, Madonna Mia. Where's your dad? He's upstairs. Samuel, quick! Get Marco. Hurry. Take these and be careful with them. [ Rooster crowing ] [ Humming ] [ Taps ] [ Knocking ] These were brought for the gentleman, ma'am. He said it was urgent. Thank you. Better hurry up. Your father will be expecting you. Rosa: Segestra. Who is that beside him? That's Angelica, his niece. She just came out of the convent. For the virgin's sake, today of all days make peace with him. I will make peace as soon as he gets his fences off my land. Aah! Hyah hyah! [ Crowd clamoring ] - Good morning. - Good morning. And you are sponsoring all of them? Yes, your honor. The papers only need your signature. Judge: And they have met all the usual requirements? Miss jeffreys: Would you care to question them on the constitution? Not if you prepared them, miss jeffreys. They most probably would show you up, your honor. [ Speaks Italian ] - Hey. - Today we are all Americans. - Good morning, doctor. Aà it's a great day. - Good morning, doctor. Oh, yes. Good morning. - Father. - Father. - [ Speaks Italian ] - [ Laughs ] Judge: Let's get on with it. As these papers indicate, you have met the legal requirements. Now raise your right hands and repeat after me: - I do solemnly swear... - I do solemnly swear... That I absolutely and entirely... That I absolutely and entirely... Renounce allegiance and fidelity... Renounce allegiance and fidelity... To any foreign state or sovereignty... To any foreign state or sovereignty... And will support and defend... And will support and defend... The constitution and law of the United States of america against all enemies, foreign and domestic... Against all enemies, foreign and domestic... - So help me god. - So help me god. By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you citizens of the united states of america. [ Cheering ] Papa, papa, congratulations. And may god have mercy on the rest of US. - [ Speaks Italian ] - Speak English, woman. - Mr. Collogero, aàcongratulations. - Thank you. I'm so proud of you, papa. - Look. - Oh, wow! Papa, mayor riggs. - Congratulations, aàmr. Collogero. - Thank you. I want you to meet Willard endicott. He's your state senator. He's up for reelection this fall and he needs your support. How do you do, sir? We've heard about your wines in Sacramento and we understand a grower needs all the help he can get right now. But we want you to know that the farmers all over this state are uniting to battle the big eastern trusts. So you just remember William Jennings Bryan's speech. "Man will not be crucified on a cross of gold." And I'm counting on men just like yourself and the good doctor here to keep the fight alive. Been good to meet you, sir. Ah, Mr. Segestra! Another one of our fine growers. How do you do, sir? You know we've heard about your wines clear down in Sacramento. We understand the grower needs all the help he can get right now. A cross of gold, huh? They are all the same. Here and in sicily. May be some truth in what they say. What do you think, Marco? - Marco? - Where's Marco? Hello, Angelica. Welcome back. Do you remember me? Of course. Antonio: Angelica. - Goodbye, Angelica. - Andiamo. I hope I can see you again. Terrible. Shame on you! Angelica: I was only saying hello. - They do nice work aà at that convent. - Yeah. [ Band playing ] Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure and honor to introduce to you the president of the berrigan pacific railroad, none other than Mr. W.R. Berrigan himself. [ Applause ] [ Fanfare ] Ladies and gentlemen, I don't like to make speeches. I like to get things done. What my railroad will do for the people of Brandon is threefold-- employment for any man who wants work... [ Cheers ] Continued growth and expansion of your town and prosperity for the people of this valley. Now anyone who wants to work can sign up with Mr. Cartwright here. It's a beautiful day. [ Speaking Italian ] In nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti. - Amen. - All: Amen. [ Speaking Italian ] Silence, silence. Look! See what it says? "Sebastiano collogero, citizen." Citizen. Do you know what that means? Those who remember know, eh, tonia? But the children, the children, they don't-- do not know. But you came from our village. You remember what we lived on-- an acre of rocks and two olive trees, and even that belonged to the landlords. So we came here to america with nothing but the strength in our hands and our backs. And they worked US 20 hours a day. We were even cheaper than the mules. We ate less and we carried more. But it did not matter. Nothing mattered. Only that we could own this land. Tonio... Remember what our mothers whispered to US in our sleep, huh? - "He who has land aà has everything." - Si. But not just for ourselves did we work for this. But for our sons and their sons after them. [ Clamoring ] So, america... - Grazie. - America. Salut! And to our land. May we work it forever. Isn't the wine good enough for you? Isn't this land good enough for you? What's the matter with it? Come on, take it. It's yours. Sebastian, I think you've had too much. No, not enough. Is it a crime for a man to want his son to have all this? Here Marco has a choice you never had. - In this country, aà a man can be anything. - Or nothing. At his age, I had a son and my first vintage. Instead of a wife, he has a widow. He may be more your son than you know. Be patient. You be honest. You wanted to make a doctor out of him. - Did it work? - Papa... [ Singing in Italian ] You know he loves you. He needs to know that all this will live on after him. He wants you to carry on the traditions, everything else. Marco: Ah, his traditions are ancient. Scola: He's bound by the old ways. All he thinks about is this land. There's better land all over this country. But not for making wine. Marco, he has too much pride to say this, but why else did he do all this, except to pass it on to you? I don't know. Look, I have rounds to make tomorrow, and these old hands are aching me. - Can I count on you? - [ Speaking Italian ] [ Speaking Italian ] Why is it your son is never home? Why is it he's never in church? Instead, he runs all over the countryside like a dog in heat. - [ Laughs ] - Sebastiano, the girls. What is true is true. Why is he on my land? His hands work. Mine don't. Perhaps I'll leave you the serum, you do it all by yourself. Marco, andiamo. - He's here? - Marco's here! Her next. Bare the arm. Bare the arm? She's a virgin. Calm yourself. The needle has been blessed. It's all right. [ Speaks Italian ] Scola: All right, next. Andiamo. [ Man shouting in Italian ] Well, if Mohammed won't come to the mountain... - Mr. Collogero. - Good morning. - Hello, Marco. - Mayor riggs. I don't want to interrupt your work, but this is important. It concerns that offer I wrote you about. I know this may not be the best time, but it could be to your advantage to act on it right away. I do not understand. Act on what? Well, it's no secret that berrigan and his railroad are buying up most of this valley. Your land is dead center, right in the path of that railroad. Then let him go around. That's just the point. It would cost a fortune to go around. That's why he's making such a generous offer. Mr. Collogero, the workers around here look to your lead, and if you sold, they'd probably follow suit. Now that's why I think I could get you a favorable price with a little extra thrown in for sweetener on my recommendation. You must not go to such trouble on our account. Oh, it's no trouble. It's just that berrigan usually gets what he wants. And the people around here want what his railroad will bring. Tell him how much I appreciate his generosity, but this land is not for sale. Ah, Brewster! Tremaine. There's champagne. There's cognac. There's Brandy. There's bourbon. - Help yourselves now. - Bourbon for me. Would you excuse US a moment, my dear? Gentlemen. So then, w.R., you didn't get US all the way down here from Sacramento just to get US blind raving drunk. You're damned right I didn't. You two scalawags, you could do that as well up there without any help from me. I'm afraid, gentlemen, it's purely a matter of business. Cartwright, the map. As you know, I've begun construction on the new line to Brandon. And most of the land has been purchased or is about to be, for grazing. The problem is on the other side. - It's right over here. - Uh-huh, yes. Here, where my track will come through, unfortunately, we've run into a group of hardheaded grape growers who are refusing to budge. - Go around them then! - It's impossible. The added cost would be astronomical, not to mention the time lost. So as senior members of the railroad commission, you want Brewster and me to get you a special right of way - so you can put them aàoff the land. - We've done it before. Yes, but due to your generosity, we're also stockholders of your corporation, which could place US at a disadvantage in a conflict-of-interest situation. Damn it, Brewster, you show me a conflict of interest. Every right-thinking mind in this state has always had the same interest: The right of way, gentlemen. You make it a priority order of business. Yes, but this time there'll have to be a hearing. I know you two gentlemen. You can get around these technical procedures the same way as I get around my board of directors. I've never forgotten those who share my vision. To the railroad! You should be ashamed of yourself. Why do you say that? My aunt says no respectable girl would be seen with you. Then what are you doing here? I have to go. You don't have to go. Woman: Angelica! I have to go. I want to see you again. [ Clamoring ] [ Speaking Italian ] Miss jeffreys has been kind enough to come down here to explain these notices to you. Miss jeffreys. These are orders of dispossession under a right of way granted to the berrigan pacific by the railroad commission. Now how many of you have received notice of hearings - on this matter? - [ Clamoring ] Yes, notices came, but after the bill was passed. Well, if what you say is true, you have every right to fight it in the courts. However, this is a legal order. [ Clamoring ] Scuse, please. But what about the money? Huh? Yeah, the offers we were made. You will receive market value for every acre of land taken. Then is that why we left our villages and came halfway around the world? No no no! So this railroad, this trust, this berrigan can snap his fingers and dismiss US with a handful of silver? No no no! They will pay a fair price. That's the law. What is the price for a lifetime of work? Huh? What's the price? I'll tell you the price: The betrayal of our children and the life we made for them. We came here for land and justice. That was the promise. Now we must hold them to that promise through the courts or by force. - Whatever is necessary! - [ All shouting ] Go. Go if you want. Take their silver. But my land is not for sale! [ All shouting ] Take it easy. Hey! You must not talk of fighting. You must use reason. Don segestra, talk to them. You know me as a man of business, a practical man. Prices are high. Commerce has been good. A man would be wise to sell now when the price is the best. That's how business is done in america. But... In this matter... We are still sicilian! Nicola, it's my duty to remove you from this property by legal writ. You've been duly served. Now get on off or I'll have to remove you forcibly. [ Horse whinnies ] Where are you going? If you want to see blood, shoot 'em yourself. By the power vested in me... By the, uh-- oh, hell. [ Cheering ] Mr. Berrigan. It seems the sheriff in Brandon has refused to execute the eviction orders. We could apply for federal jurisdiction. What, and use a Cannon to kill a fly? Besides, it'll cost US time we can't afford. - Send for Andrews. - Yes, sir. All three of you are so silly. - No, you are aàthinking of him. - You are. - Dove vai? - Where are you going? Just for a walk. [ Crickets chirping ] [ Bell ringing ] Mr. Andrews, on behalf of myself, Mrs. Riggs and our entire council, may I offer you this special writ of police powers, whereby you are-- where-- Mr. Andrews? [ Clears throat ] Mr. Andrews? Mr. Andrews, on behalf of myself, Mrs. Riggs and our-- [ Whistling ] [ Groans ] [ Muffled screams ] Get up! Very strange how that could have happened. Don't understand it. - And no one aà heard anything? - Nope. But you can go over to the office and file yourself a claim. Sheriff: Heard you had some trouble last night. Our shipment was destroyed. Yeah, so I see. Is that all you have to say? Want some friendly advice? Take whatever you can get and clear on out. - What about justice? - Justice? Well, justice wears a blindfold, don't she? Around here, she's also deaf and dumb. And currently she's the property of the berrigan pacific railroad. Hey hey! You can't come in here. Mr. Andrews. Mr. Andrews! What's the problem here? Were your men responsible for destroying my wine? I don't know what you're talking about, mister... My name is collogero. Look, sebastiano collogero. Clerk: He's one of the squatters. Then you were served. You had 48 hours to leave the land under the law. Your law is illegal. Is it? You do not frighten me. I have seen men like you before. I give you warning. Do not touch what is mine again. Wait. You. That man your father? Yes, he is. Try to reason with him. We're only here to uphold the law. The law? What law are you talking about? Son, I don't know what you do in your country but-- this... Is my country. Nice shot. Thank you. - [ Gunshot ] - [ Laughing ] [ Gunshot ] I can't take this. It's yours. You're a man of business now. Grazie,papa. This is not sicily. There is no vendetta here. There are still some men left in this valley. Some will still honor the old ways. 'Bastiano! 'Bastiano! Hey. Fazio. What are you doing on my land? Huh? Let's give this son of a bitch a tour of his winery. [ Grunting ] [ Horse whinnies ] Just kill him. [ Groaning ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Horse whinnies ] - Frisky little guy, ain't he? - [ Gunshot ] - [ Gunshot ] - Marco, what was that? I don't know. Come on. - Let's string him up. - Over here. Come on. Maria! Anna! [ Speaks Italian ] Let's get out of here. [ Rosa screams ] [ Crying ] [ Wailing ] [ Bells tolling ] [ Praying in Latin ] How many of you will stay and fight with me? Ferretti... You stood by him that day at diangelo's. Will you help me? Don Antonio... You agreed to stand beside my father. May I depend on you? Marco... Your father was a brave man. But we who have families must think about them. Marco, this is not sicily. No. This is not sicily. But there is still honor... In here. Cousin enzio. Thank you for coming. Cousin silvio. Marco, let the law handle this. - [ Ragtime music playing ] - [ Men and women laughing ] - [ Music stops ] - [ Woman screams ] Take it easy. [ Man laughs ] I'm a naughty one, ain't I? Uh-oh. It's him. Go to Samuel. [ Women screaming ] What the hell's going on? [ People shouting ] I don't know what happened here last night and I don't care. I only want to know how it will affect my schedule. It was a minor disturbance, that's all. I've seen these things snowball. - It won't affect your work. - It better not. Now this is the toughest 100 miles we've got to cover. We're pushing track north from Brandon, south down through these mountains. They'll link up right here on this Ridge-- the collogero place. All right, how close are you? I've got a trestle finished here, a tunnel three-quarters bored over there. If anything happened to either one, we'd be six months behind. I don't want to have to explain that to Mr. Berrigan, do you? What do you say we provide Mr. Carey with some peace of mind? Mayor riggs, since this is the first train through, - the honor is yours. - Thank you. My friends, may this new tunnel be the first link in a chain forming a... Cornucopia of continuing prosperity. [ Applause ] You may cut the ribbon now. Thank you. [ Train whistle blowing ] Silvio. - [ Applause ] - [ Explosion ] [ Screaming ] - [ Coughing ] - [ Gasping ] Man: Help me! My leg! Woman: Somebody come over here and help him! Damn it, Andrews. We're three months behind schedule. I've got 10,000 head of prime beef optioned and nowhere to put them. Why hasn't this man been stopped? Bill, I can't guard every inch of your railroad. I don't want excuses, Andrews. Put a bounty on the man. Do whatever you've got to do, but get him before this gets any further out of hand. That's lovely, Daniel. Thank you. Souvenir photo, miss jeffreys? No, war photographs. I think it would be a pity if the world weren't informed of the price Mr. Berrigan is paying for his victory. Don't you? Good day, sheriff. Mr. Andrews. Don't you ignore me, sir. Sir, you have brought the vilest kind of filth to our community. You have violated every aspect of normal decency. Well, then it hasn't been a total loss. Excuse me, ma'am. Andrews brought in a bounty tracker from mexicali. He could find a cockroach in the Sahara. Hey hey hey hey! Hey hey hey hey hey! - Someone's coming. Aàsomeone's coming. - Marco: Get down. - What are you doing here? - You need me. Where's your family? They've gone and I'm here to stay. - How did you know aà where to find US? - I followed you. You couldn't have followed US. I used to do it all the time when I was 12. You and Sammy used to sneak up here. You just never knew I was watching. Silvio: Great, Marco. Great hideout. [ Whistling ] - Did you have aà a good sleep? - Yes. I was dreaming about our children. We had four. Four? Marco, there's something I have to tell you. We're going to have a baby. That's good. That's very good. [ Laughs ] [ Fire sizzles ] I'm looking for Marco collogero. I'm looking for Marco collogero. [ Groans ] Hey. I'm looking for Marco collogero. I'm gonna count to three. If you don't tell me where he is, I'm gonna kill you. One, two, three. You see, Perez, we're not dealing with reasonable men. Perez: Perhaps he does not speak English. [ Gunshot ] I had no idea that any of this was happening here. I was assured that adequate compensation had been paid. Oh, yes, well, compensation was offered. But when berrigan was turned down, he hired thugs to threaten these people, beat them. He didn't even stop short of murder. This is impossible. Is it? Ho ho, senator, we have all been lied to. Want a cookie? These people were offered jobs, and instead cheap labor was brought in to do the work. The railway has brought US nothing but filth, lawlessness and immorality. Why wasn't any of this brought out in the hearings? Well, because, senator, there were no hearings. I'll do that, okay? Okay, boys, let's blast 'em to hell. Damn! Their detectives must have followed me from town. Oh, Samuel. Your mother wants to see you. - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Attention! Attention, please! The railway commission of the state of California is now in session. Any person having business before this committee may now draw near. [ Gavel banging ] Any who have business before this commission may now please step forward. Senator endicott, isn't it? - That's right, sir. - Did you wish to make aà a statement, senator? No, sir. I wish to ask a question. How is it that notice of this commission's proceedings to establish a right of way through a section of my district was in fact sent almost two whole weeks after that hearing was held? Impossible, senator. Purely an oversight. I'm sure if the senator would only examine the record... Fine. Where are the records? I'd like to see them. - See the record? - That's right. You do keep records, don't you? Of course we keep records. Well, then produce them right now. How dare you, sir? I will produce nothing. Senator, you are out of order. No, Mr. Chairman, you are out of order for the willful complicity to defraud the people of this sovereign state of their rights and privileges under the constitution! Just a moment. I will not allow this kind of-- I accuse both you and commissioner tremaine of illegally accepting both stocks and gratuities to obtain an illegal right of way so that you could line your pockets at the expense of the people of California. [ Gavel banging ] Brewster: Senator, you are out of order. Endicott: Out of order? Sir, you are out of order! I accuse Mr. William radford berrigan of masterminding this scheme to bribe the members of this commission to obtain the illegal right of way for his own corporate gain, and to further that end, making deliberate war on the people of my constituency. Senator, you are out of order. - You have no business... - [ All shouting ] How long have they been gone? Not long. [ Panting ] Marco, they're coming. Enzio: Marco, get her dress off. Why me? Because you got the best legs. Andrews: There they are. There are only two of them. Where are the others? That's the two I want. He wouldn't leave his squaw alone. Come on, let's go. [ Horse whinnies ] Very well, gentlemen, this meeting is hereby ended. You, sir, are a traitor to your party and to the people who put you in office. Well, senator, the commission has voted and you have the investigation you wanted. I shall live to see you choke on it. [ Groans ] You all right? - Anna. - Marco! - Thank god you're safe. - Are you all right? You came back. Mama wants to sell our home. She's inside packing. Maria: What are we going to do? [ Laughing ] Marco. - [ Sobbing ] - Mama, mama, mama. It must stop. It must stop! Scola: An offer of compensation has been made. Your mother wants you to accept it and put an end to all this fighting. You're asking me to forgive them. Why? Would my father have forgiven them? Look out the window. Mama, get down. [ Gunshot ] [ Horse whinnies ] Come on! Hyah! [ Panting ] [ Pounding on door ] Oh, Marco. What can I do? Marco. - I need your help. Aà they're after me. - Who? Is that fazio with them? Yes. Go in the attic. Come on. Hurry up. [ Pounding on door ] - Yes? - May I come in? - Do I have a choice? - No, lady, you don't. Where's the kid? What makes you think he's here? Hey, lady, it would be a shame to burn this house down. He's not up here. You can take my horse. It's in the barn. Come on, what did you do? [ Muttering ] [ Groans ] [ Speaking Italian ] [ Stammering ] Marco, i-- Marco. Marco, i-- I am-- fazio. Fazio. [ Speaks Italian ] Fazio. [ Crying ] I loved your father. I loved-- I loved... Your father. [ Spits ] Man: I tell you as a friend, William, the public has grown restless over this wave of investigations. Listo. Trust-busting, I think they call it. And you've become a focus of public attention. I've handled investigations before. I can do it again. Possibly. The past is always a sure thing. Listo. [ Gunshot ] Good shot. We've reached a point where principle must be compromised in the name of good business sense. Do I make myself understood? Perfectly. And once this little problem of yours is solved, I see no reason why we cannot resume our former relationship. Listo. Oh! - Is it working? - It's better than that. I think that it's worked. - It's wonderful. - Mm-hmm. Marco, Marco. Senator. They're offering real terms this time. Berrigan himself is coming here to meet you. - Marco: Sit down. - Enzio: This is a trap. Trust them, they cut off our cannolis. Just hear me out. Now they're willing to pay reparations to put your father's place back exactly the way it was. The way it was? Senator... Now as far as the meeting goes, I'll be there as a guarantor of good faith. It'll be the two of US, berrigan and his lawyers. Good faith and a bullet in the back of the neck. Look, if you come to terms, there will be no reprisals from berrigan. And I have insisted that no charges are filed against any of you. I insisted upon that. Marco, you've won the war. Tell them I'll be there. [ Band playing ] That's just a precaution. I gave them my word that you'd be unarmed. [ Knocks on door ] Cartwright: Everything's clean, Mr. Berrigan. Endicott: These two gentlemen, they're Mr. Berrigan's lawyers, the ones I told you about. All right. There's no point in wasting time. What are your terms? Give US back the land. All right, it's yours. We'll make that exception. You give him back his farm. We'll find a way around it. - What else? - Not only my land, the land of the others you stole. Stole? We paid for that land in gold. You asked for my terms. This is outrageous! You said he was a reasonable man. Is there anything else while you're at it? Yes. I want the man who murdered my father. All right. If that's what you want. Andrews. Outside. What-- what the hell are you doing? This, sir, is a complete violation of our terms. There will be no rep-- reprisals. - Against the wall. - Come on, move it. [ Spits ] Put him in the wagon, mclain. [ Gunshots ] [ Band playing ] [ Crowd screaming ] Good shot, sheriff. My pleasure. [ Machinery chugging ] - [ Gunshot ] - [ Groans ] [ Train hisses ] It's mclain. Mr. Berrigan. Sheriff, just what do you people think you're doing? Getting your town back, riggs, that's what we're doing. Put those guns away. Put 'em away now. Our guns are put away. You're all a pack of fools. [ Crowd cheering ] [ Man singing in Italian ]
