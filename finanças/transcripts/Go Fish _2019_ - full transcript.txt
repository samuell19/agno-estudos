[Mocking laughter] Oh! Watch where you're going. - [Girl] Sorry! - Ugh. Kids. Come on, Dad! - [Panting] - [woman] Yeah, Jeff. Keep up, slowpoke. I'm going as fast as I can. Give me a break. I'm pregnant. You're... It's true. It's the seahorse life cycle. Oh, well, how does it feel? Like a superhero. A really tired, weak superhero that has no powers and wants to eat all the time. [Both laughing] Hi, Eelanor. Oh, what do you want? Just saying hi. Wow! - Hey. - I'm just looking. Looking at what? - What you got in there? - Just my home. Oh. I thought you might have something amazing in there. - Why? - You spend so much time in there. Well, I like it in here. It seems very nice. And dark. And, um, small. And a little spooky... [scoffs] What's it to you? Hmm, I don't know. I just figured it must be awfully nice in there if you never come out, is all. I come out... when I have to. Do you want to come and play? Or we could go sightseeing. Or play hide and seek. I bet you're super good at hiding. Eh, I don't know. Okay, well, what do you like to do? Stay in my cave. [Yawning] Sleep. Watch the fish go by. Uh-huh. Do you want to go watch the fish in New Coralton? No thanks. I'm good. [Giggles] I know you're good, silly. But why not be great? There's so much to see and do out here. [Sighs] I get that. I'd just rather stay here. Yeah? Ooh, you're right. This is a great spot for fish watching. - Do you mind? - Nope. - No, I mean-- - Christine? Where did you swim off to? Just talking with my friend, Eelanor. Well, leave her be. I can't have you wandering off. But, Mom! Don't "But, Mom" me. I invented "But, Mom." Now come on. Fine. Bye-bye, Eelanor. Have a nice day. See ya. [Sighs] [panting] [growls] Don't give me that. You put off your cleaning for ages. Sorry about that. Yes, well, "sorry" doesn't fight gingivitis. Let's take a look. Uh, Mary? Can you bring those remoras in, please? Coming, Doctor. Go, go, go! [Gargling] Please schedule your next visit on the way out. [Humming] Thank you, Alex. Not a problem. I love my job. Have a happy day! [Eelanor clears throat] You're going to come back in six months for your next cleaning, aren't you? - Oh... - You're not going to skip again, are you? Say thank you. Thank you. - Hi, Alex. - Oh, hi, Christine. - How are you today? - Oh, fine. Fine. Christine, you come away from there. Don't bother that fish while he's working. I'm talking to my friend, Mom. - Hello, Doris. - See, Mom? - We're friends. So, there. - Hmm. Maybe she didn't hear you? Oh, it's okay. People tend to ignore me most of the time anyway. Don't worry about it. You really never get tired of chewing on the reef? Keeps my teeth sharp. And besides, it's an important job. Oh. - What's that? - [Alex] Don't know. Looks like it could be some sea kelp. Oh, he should "seek help," all right. [Chuckling] Honey. That's not funny. Hmm. Definitely sea kelp. Save that for later. You're gonna... eat that? My goodness, no. But you never know when a bit of rotting sea kelp could come in handy. - [Parents] Hmm... - It could happen. [Giggles] You are so weird. - I am? - Kinda. I never thought about it. It's just me. That's what I like about you. Aww, thanks. Christine Tabitha Seahorse, you come over here right now. What is it, Mom? How often do I have to tell you to keep up. It's not polite to bother that fish while he's working. I really don't mind. I can multitask. And it's really nice to have the company. See? Well... [Christine] Mom, can I please hang out with Alex for just a little while? He said I'm not in the way. Oh, yeah! She's totally welcome to hang with me while I make the rounds. You, um... You still have sea kelp on your face. Oh, I know. I'm just saving it for later. Everything all right, dear? Your daughter was trying to sneak away to play with her friend here. How come whenever she's in trouble she's my daughter? Oh, she's no trouble at all, ma'am. I'll be glad for the company. And strictly speaking, it's not playing. I'm doing my job. See, Mom? He's doing his job. [Chewing] See? We could always use a little quiet time, honestly. That girl's always been a fin-ful. Tell me about it. If you promise to behave yourself. Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad. [Kisses] See you guys later. Bye-bye. You be sure and have her home at a reasonable hour. Will do, Mrs. S. Hmm. [Gasps] It worked! Thank you, thank you! No problem. Come on. Uh, where are we going? I've told you. I've got rounds to make. I always wanted to ask you. Why do you eat so much coral? I mean, it can't taste very good. Come here. Let me show you something. See that? [Christine] It's just coral. [Alex] Yeah, but it's alive. And stuff grows on it. Stuff like what? Oh, a bit of algae, a bit of bacteria. Most of it's good, but some of it's bad. So, my job is to keep an eye out for the bad stuff. Oh, and make sure the good stuff doesn't get overgrown too. - By chewing on it. - Yup. But rocks aren't alive. Yeah, but coral isn't made of rocks. It's just very, very hard. And coral is definitely alive. Parrotfish like me get to... [muffled] scrape it clean with our beaks. - See? - And that's good? Yeah, it's good. [Spits] A clean reef is a healthy reef. Doesn't all that chewing hurt your mouth? Not at all. My teeth keep growing, just like the coral. We help each other out. Neat. So, is that all? - All of what? - All you do? You say it like it's some small thing. Cleaning the reef is super important. How cranky do your parents get if you don't clean your room? [Laughs] Ooh, super-duper cranky. Uh-huh, well, my job's like that. The folks in charge would be super-duper cranky if fish like me didn't keep it neat. You ever wonder what it would be like doing something else? Going off and having adventures, like a superhero? Sure, I do. What fish doesn't? I know it's not glamorous. But keeping the reef clean is important. I feel good doing it. At school, they asked us what we want to be when we grow up. - Oh, yeah? - Uh-huh. A lot of fish said they want to go on adventures and see the whole ocean and stuff. Sounds pretty cool, if you ask me. But my job's cool too. I help the reef grow. [Sighs] I wish my folks would let me grow. You think about that a lot, don't you? Uh-huh. Mom and Dad don't let me do anything. Not by myself. - That's rough. - It is. You know, they won't even let me swim to school on my own. Have you talked to them about doing stuff on your own? I tried. But my mom still thinks I'm just a baby. Maybe you should ask her if you can help out sometime. What do you mean? Well, remember how I said some of the stuff growing is good, - and some of it's bad? - Uh-huh. The good bacteria starts to help the reef as it gets bigger. That's how I know I can let it keep growing. So, if I show Mom and Dad I can help out, maybe they'll start letting me grow up? - Uh-huh. - You know, I don't think I ever would have thought of that. [Chuckles] What are friends for? - [Mary] Help me! Somebody help! - [Gasps] - Breathe, breathe... - Watch where you're swimming. [Mary] Sorry. I can't-- I can't see! [Thud] - What? - [Gasping] I can't-- I don't know what happened. I will help you! Oh, boy, I get to help someone. I'm going to be a superhero. Have no fear, I'm here to help. Who's there? Who is that? I can't see. My name is Alex. I'm here to help you. Breathe with me. Keep calm and carry on. [Laughs] That's a meme. How can I be calm? Something's on my face. - What is that? - I don't know. What are you-- What are you doing? Please just breathe, okay? I think-- I think I have something. Don't go anywhere. Ah! How could I go anywhere? [Spits] Ah! What are you doing? [Muffled] Stay real still with me, okay? - Hurry! - Don't move. That's-- What did you do? It's a dispersant. It disperses. A fancy word for breaking stuff up. Some people are quite impressed when I say, "Dispersant." What does it do? Oh, I use the word dispersant on tough stains. - You're the janitor? - Yup. Thank you, thank you, thank you! - You're welcome, uh... - Mary. Mary, I'm Alex. What the heck happened to you? I'm not sure. I-- - Wait. This might-- - What? What is it? I have the feeling we're gonna want to take this to the king. All rise. You are graced with the presence of King Charles XIV. He's a busy fish. So make it snappy. [Clears throat] Hello, my liege. [Paul] Speak already. Oh, Your Majesty. I'm just a humble servant, a janitor of the kingdom. A janitor! Oh, I can't wait to hear this. Yes. And this morning, this wonderful fish named Mary accidentally crashed into the reef. And just where did she think she was going? Hmm? The reef is huge. With respect, she was blinded with some kind of... Well, maybe you tell him. Hello. Um, gosh. I've never been in front of royalty before. If you keep wasting time, you won't get to again. Get to the point. I'm very sorry for dirtying up your reef, but I couldn't see where I was going. Some black goop got in my eyes while I was out swimming. Oh! You soiled our beloved reef? The nerve! How dare you! - It was an accident. - I cleaned it up, though. Who is that? I don't recognize him. Yeah, who are you? Alex, Your Majesty. I help clean the reef. Oh? And where were you when this fish got her yuck everywhere? - I was-- - Ooh, an excellent question, Your Majesty. - Answer him! - I was cleaning the reef. And what? You were expecting some kind of special commendation for doing your job? [Chuckles] Get a load of this fish. [Mocking laughter] Most unseemly. Ooh, you hear that? The king thinks you're unseemly. No, I'm here because... I'm here because I'm worried about the reef. The goop that got in Mary's eyes, it's unlike anything I've ever seen before. But you just said you cleaned it up. That's right. Which is it, Mr. Smartyfish? Did you clean it up, or didn't you? - Not exactly, no. - [Paul] Mm-hmm. How exactly then? Well, this goop is thick and sticky. I was able to break it up, but not dissolve it. I don't know that it can be dissolved. If you please, Your Majesty. What? What's this? Who's this? Speak up, tiny seahorse. [Stammers] My name is Christine. [Gulps] And I was there when Mary ran into us. And every word Alex said is true. He was able to break up the goop. He knew just what to do. It's still there. It's still a danger. Danger! Oh! What danger? Dangerous, how? How dangerous? Please, it took all the dispersant I had to break up even that small bit. - If there's more-- - There's more? Who said there was more of this stuff? What makes you think there was more? What makes you think there isn't? How disrespectful! Oh, you're right again, Your Majesty. Get a load of this guy. Just who do you think you're talking to? Forgive me. I'm sorry, truly. I just think we're in a very real danger here, Your Majesty. - No. - What? This clumsy fish stumbled into a tiny drop of some mysterious substance. And you wish to declare a state of emergency? You'd cause a panic. - I won't have it. - But, Your Majesty-- You got a hearing problem, kid? - He said-- - I won't hear of it. - You did your job, little janitor. - Custodian. And I will do mine. I am charged with protecting the people of New Coralton from danger and vouchsafing my citizens. [Chuckles] Oh, I just love it when you talk shop. Now hit him where it hurts! Dangers including irrational concerns that will cause a reef-wide hysteria. - I will not have it! - But your-- You will not mention this wild fantasy of yours to anyone. [Paul] And if we find out that you have, you're gonna be in some hot water, let me tell you! Too much? That was too much. You're right, that was too much. Sorry, chief. Won't happen again. But what do I do? You'll go back to work. [Chuckles] Living out the drudgery of your peasant existence. That sounds needlessly harsh. [King] And we will never bring this up again. Is that understood? The king asked you a question. [Softly] I understand... Know this, little fish. Your impudence today betrays a fundamental misunderstanding. You are a parrotfish. You will always be a parrotfish. And you will never, ever amount to more than a lowly, common, insignificant parrotfish. Your audience has ended. That will be all. Any seeking the king's attention will have to come back tomorrow. Now, move along! How do you feel, boy? Ed, how did you-- Long as I've known you, you always come here to think. Right. I saw you with the king today. That was either really brave or really dumb. - I can't decide. - I don't know. Why can't fish your age take a compliment? Oh, it's not that. It's just I don't feel like I did anything. The king isn't going to let me go look for the source of the goop anyway. No. No, he's not. [Alex] It's like I want to be a good subject. I love it here. We're all safe and life is good. - But-- - But, I don't know. I feel like maybe I should be doing something more. - Your heart's in the right place. - [Sighs] Thank you. It would be nice to get a little respect, though. - Huh? - My job's important. Why sure it is. So why do I get treated like a second-class fish? People don't think about the folks who help keep them clean. - It's just a thing. - A dumb thing. - You don't need to worry about the goop. - No. No, because I know where it comes from. - You do? - Oh, yes. It's the ink of the Black Beast. - Black Beast? - [Ed and Alex scream] Blast it, girl. You almost gave me a heart attack. Christine, where are your parents? Oh, don't you start. I'm big enough to swim on my own. Now tell me more about the Black Beast. You wanna hear the legend of the Black Beast of Bargathel? You sure? I don't want to hear your parents complain that I gave you nightmares. - [Alex] No! - I won't be frightened. Well, then. The Black Beast of Bargathel. Out past where the red smoke spills. In his crag, dark and deep, the giant rests a fitful sleep. - [Gasps] - His arms are each a mile long. His eyes a terror, his breath a maul. The Black Beast heeds no rule, no law. All fish fear to wake the Beast, unless they wish to be-- - Hey. - [All scream] Ugh. This is why I never go out. Saints alive, girl, you trying to kill me? [Sighs] Hi, Eelanor. We were just talking. I heard about your talk with the king. Sounds like it didn't go so well. Yeah. Yeah... you know. Anyway, I just wanted you to know I get it. Get it? You get what? It stinks when you try to do something and it doesn't work out. - I guess so. - [Eelanor] Don't be the hero. When you fail, it hurts. [Sighs] Sorry, kiddo. [King] You go back to work. You will not mention this wild fantasy of yours to anyone. [Seagulls squawking] [sighs] Another beautiful day on the rig. [Chuckles] [breathing heavily] [man] At it again, huh, Kelly? You betcha, Sam. Heart rate up. Coffee... Let's go. Right on time. Ugh. - Morning! - Good morning. This is pretty early for you. I haven't actually gone off my shift yet. I was supposed to be relieved at 7:00. Okay. [Man] These hours they got us working don't bug you? I knew what I was getting into when I signed on. Same as you. - If you didn't like it... - Whatever. - How's our baby? - Fine. She's fine. Pressure's at optimum levels. We're filling up right now. With zero-percent spillage, right? It's at an acceptable-- - Zero percent means zero percent, Dennis. - Yeah. The EPA only approved this operation because a representative was going to - oversee the operation. - Oversee the operation. I know, but do you have to hover? It's the cost of doing business. It's why I make the big bucks. I'm going to finish my run and be back on the clock in an hour or so. I still can't believe you jog up and down this heap. Your boss wouldn't spring for the treadmill. [Seagulls squawking] [panting] [Eelanor gasps] Oh! [Breathing heavily] [sighs] - Hi. - Hi, Christine. - You doing okay? - Sure, I guess. Okay, you just seem kinda down is all. If someone told you to ignore something, even if you thought it was bad, would you? Oh... I don't know. What kind of thing are you talking about? A mess. [Chuckles] Ooh, boy, no. My mom hates it when I don't pick up after myself. - She does? - Oh, yes. What if the king himself told you to ignore a mess? I don't know if I could. My mom would be awful mad at him. Oh, yes. Right. [Christine] Hey, where you going? Christine? Christine! [Grunting] - [whooshing] - What? Hey! Where you off to in such a hurry? - To find your Beast. - What? Alex. Whoa! The king said to stay put. This is right where Mary hit the wall. If he finds out you disobeyed him, he's gonna punish you. I'm already leaving. What's he gonna do? Banish me? Ooh, goodness. Alex! Christine Tabitha Seahorse, you get back here this instant. No. - What did you say? - I said no. I want to help Alex. - You do? - Uh-huh. You can't go swimming off just because you want to. I'm not a little kid. When are you going to stop treating me like one? - She's got you there, hon. - You're not helping. I'm not about to let you swim off into the wild blue yonder all by yourself. Well, I'm not by myself. Ed's gonna chaperone. - Uh, I am? - See? Now, hang on a tick. You can't just-- Then I guess you'd better come along and look after us, huh? Blasted kids. Well? I'll look after them. Well, as long as you're not out too late, I suppose - you can go for a short day trip. - [Gasp] Ugh. Oh, thanks, Mom! [Kisses] Come on! - Slow down! - Why? There are things out here that will eat you if they get the chance. It's not safe out here in the open ocean. Yeah, you didn't think of that, hmm? - I'll be careful. - He'll be careful. The bright, colorful parrotfish is going to be careful. I can be careful too. You're not much better, little bean. Oh... - Yeah, so think it through, son. - I have, okay? I have. This is something I have to do. I have to help. For crying out loud, why? Because if I don't and the goop gets worse, then that's my fault. I have to know for sure. I have to help. Are you sure you're not just doing this for the attention? What? No! I'm doing it because it needs to get done. You see any other volunteers? Okay. Well... which way? - This way. - Uh-huh. And let's say you find the thing making this black goop. You mean, the Black Beast? Sure. What are you going to do? That's what I thought. If Alex says we should try, then we should try. You've got a good heart, kid. But I don't think either of you know the first thing... uh, about... Oh, no. Well, well, well. What have we got here? But um... [stammers] A bit late for you to be this far from the reef, isn't it? Uh... hi, there... Maria. Show some respect. Maria. Hi, there. - We're just passing through. - [Maria chuckles] - We don't want any trouble. - He doesn't want any trouble. - Who is she talking to? - Quiet! Um, sorry if we... intruded. We're on a mission. - Is that so? - [Stammers] Yes. King's orders. Hmm. You must be very important. I've never eaten anyone important before. I wonder what important tastes like. Leaving so soon? We haven't even had the appetizers yet. [Snarls] What's the big idea, Maria? What's up, Eelanor? You wanna tell me why you're bothering my friends? [Maria] Friends? You hang out with these fish sticks? Talk about playing with your own food. So what if I do? You wanna make something of it? [Scoffs] Nah, girl. I just figured with your place in the food chain and all, you might have some taste. [Laughs] So? You can talk, hanging with that dimwit cousin of yours. You've got some nerve. You're lucky he's not here right now. Whatever. It's not worth it. Catch you shrimps later. [Sighs] Maria can be a real jerk. You guys are lucky she was alone and that I came along. That was amazing! Thank you, thank you, thank you! What are you even doing out here this late? You're going on the super dangerous quest of yours, aren't you? Yes. You know, there's a lot worse out there than Maria, right? Fish and things that wouldn't think twice about chomping you up in one bite. Well, I guess it's a good thing I'm coming with you then. So, which way? [Ed] Well, I'll be. Hey! Wait up! [Panting] [Ed] And that's why dolphins can rest half their brains at a time. - [Christine] Wow! - [Eelanor] There's no way that's true. - It is true. - Where on earth did you learn that? Not everybody sticks to the reef their whole lives, kiddo. - Some of us have a spirit of adventure. - Really? Uh-huh, I wanted to get out there in the deep, find the Black Beast. - Oh, here we go again. - He's real, I tell you! You've been out in the ocean all by yourself? Yup. You're looking at a regular explorer of the deep blue sea. Wow! I don't think I could ever do that. Kid, what do you think we're doing right now? Ooh, but on my own, I mean. Because I'm so little... - Tell me about it. - I see what you mean, kid. I used to be scared of going out in the deep too. But as it happens, some of us have natural defenses. So, bigger fish don't eat us. - Like what? - Get a load of this. [Inhales] [hissing] [gasps] Whoa! You certainly look less appetizing, I can tell you that much. Look, Alex. Ed's using his super power. Huh? What's the squirt talking about? Oh, we were just talking earlier about heroes, like you, buddy, going out in the open sea. Uh-huh. And blowing up like that's your super power. [Chuckles] Yeah, I guess it is. [Ed] What about you, you big noodle? What's your super power? Oh, well, I can do this. - Do what? - Ah! - [Gasp] - Jeez, kid. Warn me before you do something like that. I did. I said, "I can do this..." Ah! That's so cool. - You think so? - What about you, Alex? Oh, well, I showed you my teeth, my beak, and how I keep the reef clean. Knew this hagfish named Magda. When she got in trouble, she'd secrete this awful mucous all over the place. - Gross! - Oh yeah, it was awful. And the smell, too. But it made her slicker than anything. Good luck trying to catch her after that. Then there's the fabulous flying Pesci brothers, flying fish. They could fly? Well, not literally. But they could, you know, zoom right out of the water. Skip, skip, skip. They looked ridiculous, but they sure could move in a hurry. Oh, and then there's Rod Ostracod. - Rod Ostracod? - Rod Ostracod, - son of Maude. - Maude Ostracod? - How odd. - What could they do? Nothing too flashy. They could make you spit out light. [Laughs] That is so cool! Wait. How? When the Ostracods got in a bind, like getting eaten for instance, they'd glow in the dark. How does that help if you're already getting eaten? [Ed] Well, simple. If the fish eating you is transparent, and doesn't want to get spotted by a fish trying to eat it, he can't afford to have a belly full of glow-in-the-dark fish, can it? So... [spits] Out you go. That is so cool. Here, kid. Check this out. Come here. They have some pretty neat defenses. They do? Huh! - Be quiet now. - Why? Because sea cucumbers spook easily. They do! - [Whispers] They do? - Uh-huh. How does it work? Well, that's a good question. You see they-- [groans] No! Gross! - Oh, this is the worst. - [Laughter] [Christine] Oh, that poor thing. [Eelanor] Ah! It'll be fine. It'll grow back everything it just blurped up in a week or two. - Really? - Yes, really. - [Gasps] - [gasps] [all laughing] Seriously, though, we should get this stuff off us. It could be toxic. [Gasping] Hmm. - Ah, hello, there. - Well, good morning to you. - Are you here for a cleaning? - Do I look like I need to be cleaned? - Well, your highness... - That's not the point! [Clears throat] I'm here on royal business. Have you seen this Alex character about? He's a... janitor. Oh, yes! He does a great job. I haven't seen him, though. Not since, hmm, two days go. Hmph! Too ashamed to show his face after talking back to the king. No. He showed up late in the night and told me he'd be gone for a few days. Real responsible fish, that one. - Gone? Gone where? - How should I know? Fish gotta swim. And you've gotta do... What do you do again? - I am the king's majordomo. - Listen, I've got customers. Do you need anything else? You're kinda taking up space here. - How dare you! - There a problem here, pal? No! No trouble. Ugh. Good day. [Gargling] Ugh. [Gasps] - Hmm. - Ah, should you be in here? I could say the same thing of you, missy. Who are you? I'm Mary. Alex said I could stay here and rest until I was feeling well enough to leave. Did he? You know he disobeyed a direct order from the king? - Hey! I know you. - Yes, yes, yes, I-- You're the meanie that called me an outsider! I'm just a fish, you know? I'm no different than you. Hmph! How dare you! How dare I, what? Rest in a friend's hospitality after I got hurt? You're so important, why aren't you out there helping people? - What the-- - Why don't you just get out of here? At least Alex was willing to help me when I needed him. What are you doing? Hmm? Just leave me alone. [Sighs] Honestly. [Christine] Oh, pretty. [Ed] Don't touch those, little bean. Those things can sting like crazy. - Oh! - [Eelanor] Don't listen to him. You'll be fine as long as you don't get too close. So, uh, why'd you come out here anyway? - [Stammers] Me? - Yeah. I guess I wanted to show that I could. Show who? Your folks? Or me, even. I've never been on an adventure before. I hope I'm doing it right. Hey, wanna know a secret? I've never been adventuring either. - You haven't? - Uh-uh. But why not? You're so big. And you can do that jaw thing. Ah! [Laughs] Well, I guess... I guess I don't want to go out on my own. There's a lot of jerks out there like Maria, so I stay at home a lot. I get it. It's not easy, is it? Making new friends. Especially when you look like this. - I like the way you look. - Yeah? Uh-huh. And you're nice. How am I nice? Well, whenever I've talked to you, you've treated me like a person, not like a baby. Oh. You're welcome. I wish my parents would do that. But they keep treating me like a little kid. That's rough. But this is my first adventure! And I want to get it right. [Chuckles] Oh, yeah? How do you know if you're doing it right or not? Well, I haven't gotten eaten yet, so that's a good start. Excellent start. They only said you could come because I told them I'd look after you. So stay close, little bean. - How about you? - Who? Me? You come out all this way just to look for some black goop? Yeah, pull the other fin. Well, I did come out here for that. So it's got nothing to do with proving yourself? No. I mean... It wouldn't be the worst thing in the world to get a little respect. - Uh-huh. - Is that so wrong? No, kid. No. Am I really safe if I don't get too close? [Eelanor] Oh, sure. Dumb things don't even have brains. What? It's true, kid. Jellyfish don't have any brains. - No way! - Yes way. [Ed] Plenty of fish get by without any brains. - Just look at Paul. - [Gasps] That's not very nice. Funny, sure. But not very nice at all. I won't tell him if you won't. - Hey, kid. - Yes? - What's in the middle of a jellyfish? - I don't know. The jelly button. [Giggles] That's not true. Yeah, well, why do jellyfish envy every other fish? - I don't know. - 'Cause they're all jelly. [Laughs] Stop it. One more, one more. Why do jellyfish live in saltwater? I don't know. Because pepper water makes them sneeze. Everybody's a critic. Are you sure we're going the right way? I think so. Gosh, I've never been even half this far out before. You're all right, kid. You're in safe company. I'll look out for you, Christine. Don't you worry. Plus, I'm an old pro when it comes to the ocean. Yes, sir. I've seen it all, my friends. Why, I remember this one time-- What the heck is that? [Alex] Wow! What is that? I've never seen fins like this on a fish before. [Eelanor] I don't think it's a fish. [Echoing] Hello? Hello? I think it's safe to go in. Come on. Wow! Would you look at that? What is this stuff? - [Alex] What is it, Ed? - I don't know what it is. But I think I know who made this thing. - What? - It's people. Humans. People made this. It's big enough for them to fit inside. - Humans? - [Ed] Yeah, land things. Tall, two arms, two legs, no gills. Soft on the outside, but strong. And they come in all sorts of colors. Is this another tall tale like: [dramatic voice] The Black Beast of Bal-- [normal voice] Whatever it was. Bargathel! And he's real, dagnabbit. - What's it doing down here? - [Ed] I don't know. - I doubt it got out here on purpose. - I like it. It's dark, it's moody, lots of space to mope around in. Great for sulking. [Voice quivering] Do you think it could be haunted? Oh, no! Relax, little bean. There's no such thing as ghosts. - [Thud] - Pretty sure. I've never seen anything like this before. What do you think this is for? No idea. Never been in one before today. I don't understand half the things humans get up to. Ah! Ugh. [Sighs] [bubbling] [electronic whir] - [Kelly] Everything okay? - Yup. Hmm... Um... Hmm... [teeth chattering] Great! Keep it up. [Exhales] [nervous chuckle] [groans] [bubbling] Huh. Hmm. [Gasps, screams] [panting] Huh? [Fish screams] - [coughing] - [screaming] [Mary] Oh, my God! You there, parrotfish! - Explain yourself this instant. - Huh? [Screaming continues] - Sorry? - I should hope so. What do you call this? I've never seen anything like it before. It wasn't there yesterday, I know that for sure. - Oh? - Mm-hmm. I come through here every day. Well? Aren't you gonna clean it up? [Sputters] Yuck. That is awful. Sorry, sir. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to do about this. [Sighs] Your colleague, the other janitor? We have names. - Alex. - Oh, him. Yeah! Yeah, he'd know. He's the expert on this stuff. Wait a minute. I remember you now. You work for the king. - Yes! - Didn't Alex warn you guys about this? I remember him telling us he was gonna bring it up to you. Well, that's beside the point. No, I'm pretty sure that is the point. Wow, I'd hate to be you right now. What do you mean by that? I sure don't want to be the one to tell the king he made the wrong call. - It stinks to be you. - [Gasps] The king! He'll be furious! [Giggling] Ah! Come on, guys. Focus! We've got a job to do. Hey, we came this far with you, didn't we? Oh, I know. I just don't wanna get bogged down by any more... distractions. Well, well, what have we here? Looks like lunch to me. What do you say, Bernardo? [Bernardo] I'd say you're right, Maria. We don't want any trouble with you. Hey! Missy the eel here doesn't want any trouble. [Sharks laugh] - I mean it. - Oh, we know you mean it. That's what makes it so funny. Now, what in the world are the four of you doing out here in the deep all by yourselves, hmm? We're looking for the Black Beast of... of... - Bargathel. - The Black Beast of Bargathel. Ooh, I'm shaking in my fins. There's something out here making a mess. Kid, zip it. They don't care. They're just playing with us. Now, I've got no beef with the eel girl. But I can't say the same for her friends. Too bad they don't have any clownfish in their little hero party. No, Maria. Those taste funny. Speaking of team sports, water polo. One shark away from being the greatest sport ever. You catch me at the beach this weekend? There was a guy flailing and thrashing around. "Oh, help. Shark. Help." Like I was gonna help him. More like turn him into helpings. [Chuckles] We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Bernardo. - This is Maria. - We've... We've met. You'll have to go through me first. You'd really get between me and those danglers on the food chain? Yes. [Maria] I don't mind. I've never eaten eel before. [Ed] Swim for it! [Gasping] What are you thinking? I don't know. But it's better than getting eaten out here. [Growls] Oh boy. What is this? Santa Maria, this is awful. Ugh. No fish is worth this. - Oh! - [Panting] [Eelanor] I think we're okay. What? What is it? You saved my life. They would have gotten me for sure. - Hey, it's okay. - [Christine] It's not okay. Nobody's ever done that for me before. [Clears throat] Yeah, well, I've never had a friend like you before. - You haven't? - [Eelanor] Alex and Ed are pretty decent. But it's nice having another girl around I can talk to. You mean it? Yeah, well, why wouldn't I? It's nice to have a friend who treats me like a grown-up. Well, yeah, you're not a little kid anymore. You're just the best! [Nervous chuckle] Easy with the mushy stuff. Your Majesty. Your Majesty! I don't recall summoning you, Majordomo. And I'm terribly sorry about that, Your Majesty. - But-- - But what? But there's a matter of some urgency that demands-- Demands? Of a king? [Laughs] That-- That would greatly benefit from your kind attention, your graciousness. Hmph. Out with it. It's just that there's some signs that the goop the parrotfish warned us about-- The janitor? Yes. Yes, Your Majesty. Signs that he... Signs he was... right. Oh, I must have misheard you. Would you care to repeat that? The parrotfish was right. I've seen more of the black goop around the reef. I think we should reconsider evacuating the city. I really must get my hearing checked. For a moment, I could swear that you said that a janitor, a lowly, common peasant, was right. Which would make me, the king, wrong. But you couldn't possibly have said that. Saying that me, your king, would be tantamount to treason. And I know that you, my faithful majordomo, would never be so fulsomely stupid to utter such a thing to our royal self. - Of course not! - Of course not! There is no problem, for we have acknowledged that there is no problem. We declared it. The king is never wrong about these things. We wouldn't last very long as king if we went around being wrong. Therefore, there is no problem. And there will be no evacuation. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. - Excellent. And since there is no problem, we shall take our royal constitutional. You are dismissed. Yes, sir! [Panting] - What's wrong, kid? - [Alex] I've got some of that muck on me. It's in my eye. It's in my eye and it stings. Oh! [Steam hisses] - Hey. - What? That actually smells familiar. Alex, get away from there. Oh! Oh, my goodness! Come back here. It's gonna cook you. Alex? - You're okay. - What happened? Well, I noticed the smoke and I realized it smells a lot like the dispersant I used on the goop. I figured it might do the trick getting it off me. I bet if we could find a way to get this stuff back to the reef, - we could-- - Are you crazy? You could have gotten yourself cooked. Well, I didn't stay in it too long. Seemed like a good idea at the time. You sure have a weird notion about good ideas. - Well, it worked, didn't it? - Yeah. Okay, okay. I can't argue with results. - Oh! Don't you scare me like that again. - Yeah! Okay, okay. But seriously, this is good news, right? Now all we have to do is sort out where the black stuff is coming from and-- [Ed] Out past where the red smoke spill. - What? - The Black Beast of Bargathel. I think we're getting close. You don't actually think he's real, do you? Of course I do. I've heard the legend my whole life. You're the one who said he might be the one making that black muck. It could be his ink. Well, yeah. But I just said that-- You just said that-- What? So you'd come with me. - You think I'm dumb, don't you? - What? You think I'm dumb for believing the Black Beast is out there, even though I've never seen it. What, no! I just-- It's dangerous out here for a fish on his own. And you thought, what? "Oh, Ed's nice and gullible. He'll come along if I feed him enough hogwash." [Alex] I never said that. It's a volcano. It has nothing to do with your Beast. I mean, if the stories were true, right past the red smoke, there would be a deep, dark crag. And I don't see a deep, dark crag anywhere around here. Oh, look, a deep, dark crag. [Laughs] You see! You see, I told you! The Beast is real! Do you think he's down there right now? I have no idea. Ask the expert. You see? You see, I told you. [Laughs] [whimpers] You're not gonna wake him, are you? I don't think I would like that very much. What, you little bean? [Chuckles] A creature as big as that wouldn't even notice you. [Sighs] Oh. Oh, good. Now, Eelanor, on the other hand, she might just be big enough to make an appetizer. - Quit it. - Guys. As for Alex, he might get to stick around cleaning the big guy's beak. Guys! What is that? [Bubbling] Guys, I think we found it. Sure we did. The Beast is right down there. But the goop, it's trailing across the crag, not from it. - So? That doesn't mean-- - Come on! - [Christine] Alex! - [Eelanor] Be careful. [Alex] Guys, I'm not going down. Relax. Sheesh. I think this is it. [Christine] What are they doing? I think they're pulling something up out of the ground. - [Eelanor] The black stuff? - Uh-huh. You guys, we found it! We did it! We found where the muck is coming from. That's really great. Fine detective work you did. - Now what? - What? You found the problem. Black stuff is definitely for sure coming out of that crack. - What are you gonna do about it? - I... don't know. Uh-huh. Are you mad at him? Me? Oh, no, everything's just great. We followed him out to the middle of nowhere to solve his great, big mystery, and the genius doesn't have the first idea how to fix it. But I'm sure we just have to wait a little bit and our genius will come up with another wacky idea to save the day. What are you saying? Oh, look at Alex. He's so silly. Can't go a day without coming up with more harebrained schemes. "Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!" That's what this is really about. Saving the day's great and all, but what you really want is to be the hero. Who cares how dumb you look with your weird ways, - as long as they're looking at you? - That's not why-- And you two, it's great you two came along for moral support and all. Hey! Don't talk to us like that. - We've been helpful. - Oh, yeah? You never would have made it out of the reef without me, you blowfish! - I can take care of myself. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! - Well, what did you come along for, huh? - Guys... - What do you mean? I mean, you're not happy unless you're complaining about something or pouring out your great wisdom about the ocean [mocking] for us empty-headed kids! That and your weird fixation on this big, giant, imaginary Beast of yours. - He's real! - Prove it! - Guys! - So don't go acting all high and mighty with me, Mr. Big Fish. You came out here for the same reason we did. Oh, yeah? What's that? It's because you don't know what else to do! So Alex doesn't know what to do next, big deal! At least he found the problem. - He's got us this far. - You-- Did you want to stay at home, wait for the problem to get worse? Huh? Please stop fighting. Because that's all it's gonna do: get worse. And your big, fat Beast of Barga-whatever isn't gonna fix it. - [Ed] You-- - [scoffs] - Fat, lot of good you were. - That's enough! [Crying] That's what you guys really think of me? Just some deluded, prickly old grouch, huh? At least we're trying to think of something, instead of pointing out what everybody is doing wrong. I don't have to stick around for this. Come on, squirt. Let's leave these two geniuses to their work. Little bean, you coming? [All gasp] It's a human! He'll notice the crack. He has to. No! Come on! It's right there. Open your eyes. Come back, please! Come back! It's like I told you, kid. The humans will never notice you. You're just not big enough. Better off sticking to problems your own size. Now, if you'll excuse me, I wanna go have a word with the Black Beast, who is a hundred percent real. Yes, sir. Gonna go see him myself. Come on, Christine. I'll take you home. There's nothing we can do here anyway. Guys, wait. I'm sorry, Alex. I wish there was something we could do. Maybe Ed was right after all. There is nothing we can do. [Alex] Christine! Eelanor! Nobody ever listens. [Coughing, groaning] [gasps] [growls] Oh, no. Don't, don't-- Down in there, it's dark. [Grunts] - Where's the king? - Yeah, where is he? He's indisposed right now. What can I do for you, fine fish? We wish to lodge a complaint. - Yeah, in the strongest possible terms. - Mm-hmm. What kind of complaint? - Look at us! - We're a mess. We can't get this muck off us. Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry, believe me. I've already tried to tell His Majesty about this once already. Wait, what? I tried to tell him things were getting worse. He wouldn't listen. - Wouldn't listen? - That's outrageous! Now, see here, the king's gotta do something about all this, or else. Or... [gulps] Or else, what? Or maybe we won't want him to be king anymore. [Nervous laughter] You have to be joking. Bunch of-- You bunch of kidders. Do we look like we're joking? He's the one in charge, that makes this his job to fix this. What in the sea do you expect him to do about it? Well, where's that janitor fish that came to see him? - Yeah! - We know he came to see you about this. So what's the king going to do about it? [Stammers] The king is in a... private session! With his cabinet. And I will... I'll make sure he knows about your awful plight. I'll tell him personally. Well, good! We're gonna wait right here until you do. [All] Yeah! [Gasping] Your Majesty! The peasants are revolting. What are we gonna do? They've always been revolting. But we've got bigger problems. What are you going to do? [Gasps] Why wasn't this brought to my attention before? How could you let things get so bad? Wait, what? I said, why didn't you bring this to my attention before, hmm? Some majordomo you turned out to be. We've got a full-blown crisis on our fins! - But you knew! - I beg your pardon. I was there. That little janitor, Alex, stood right in front of you and told you all about this. And you said to do nothing. Oh, really? I don't think it happened like that. Oh, sure! Nothing's ever the king's fault. I'm glad you agree. Now, what are-- I stood up for you! Defended you to those poor fish outside, who look to you for answers! You-- You big-- You big-- You big phony! Out! Out of here this instant! [Scoffs] I'm not sticking around here. Fraud! Sham! Fraud-sham! Out this instant! We just have to wait, you'll see. Everything will be fine. We just have to wait it out. [Chuckles] Yes. Yes... What am I going to do? Come on. There has to be something. Wait a minute. If I'm too small, maybe I just need to work my way up the food chain. Come on, big guy. I know you're down here. You just gotta be. Forget it, buster. You don't want any of this. It's gonna take more than some bright lights and long teeth to... [grunts] scare me. - [Squid growls] - [Ed] Uh... Do you think Alex will be all right? Yeah, he'll be okay. I don't feel like talking about him, though. You don't? Nah, I... Well... - I wanted to talk about you. - You do? Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool that you wanted to come along, is all. Oh, yes, very much! The reef is important to me too. And just because I'm small doesn't mean I'm a little kid. - I wanted to help, somehow. - I get it. And we wouldn't have made it very far at all without you. You were terribly brave. - Eh, I don't know about brave. - [Maria] Oh, yeah, tell us about it. [Bernardo] We were just talking about you two. [Maria] Yeah, you left in such a hurry, we didn't even get to chew the fat. So rude, we were just trying to grab a bite. Well, we don't really have time right now. Oh, you're not going anywhere. - [Maria laughs] - [gasps] [Bernardo laughs] - [growl] - [Alex] Oh, hey. Dumbos. - Did he just call us "dumbos"? - I think he did. Still hungry? Big dummy sharks! - He called us dummies? - I take exception to that. - [Stammers] Alex? - What is that fish thinking? [Alex] I bet you won't come in after me. You're too scared! - Ugh. His trash talk is abysmal. - Right? I'm eating parrotfish tonight. Gotta catch me first. [Sharks snarl] [grunts] [gasps, shouts] [Alex panting] When I get my teeth on you, you little... Where'd he-- [sharks shouting] - Jets of hot water! - [Maria] I hate jets. [Bernardo] Stinking jets. [Whimpers] Oh! [Grunts] Ugh. What is this stuff? Get it off me. - Whoa! What? - [Alarm blaring] Is something wrong? It's one of the sub-sea systems, I think. I think it's sprung a leak. So then why isn't it showing up on the screen? You know what? You're absolutely right. Just a second, I need to update something. There would have been a pressure warning. I... I don't have that information. - [Kelly] What's the pressure at now? - [Stammering] - What did you do? - I didn't-- I'm gonna need you to step away from your station, Dennis. That's not necessary. I can-- Whoa! [Kelly] What has gotten into them? And why does your screen still show normal pressure - when there's clearly a leak down there? - [Groans] Little bean, Eelanor, what are you guys doing here? - We have to help Alex. - What did he get into now? [Grunting] [Ed] Hey, jerk faces. Did he just call us "jerk faces"? What is wrong with fish today? - [Bernardo laughs] - Oh, great. [Bernardo] Let's get him. - Ed! - [Ed] What? [Alex] Did you find the Black Beast down there? [Ed] Yeah, but he's sleeping, thank goodness. Why? Because I just got a really bad idea. Ooh, boy. I'm gonna regret this. - Which way is it? - Down. Which way you think? Well, you don't have to yell at me. This feels like a pretty good time for yelling. [Gasping, panting] When I say, "Pull up," pull up, okay? - Okay. - [Snarling] [whimpering] [panting] - [Bernardo laughs] - Steady? - [Alex cries out] - [Bernardo laughs] Almost there. [Sharks snarl, laugh] [Ed] Now! - What the heck did we run into? - I don't know. The Black Beast of Bargathel. - Out past where the red smoke spills. - Oh, no. [Ed] In his crag, dark and deep, the giant rests a fitful sleep. His arms are each a mile long. Grown fish dread to hear his song. His eyes a terror, his beak a maul. The Black Beast heeds no rule, no law. Swim for it, girls! All fish fear to wake the Beast, unless they wish to be his feast. [Beast growls] That's right. Shut them all down. We're going to have to do a complete check on every inch of those pipes to make sure our colleague here didn't overlook anything else. Shut down production in the meantime. We don't want to make it any worse. Thank you. This right here is why people hate us, you get that, right? Yeah, well, I didn't come out here to fill out safety reports. I came out here to drill. Do you have any idea what kind of quotas we have to fill, huh? So there's a teensy, tiny crack in one little pipe, so what? It's a few drops in the bucket compared to what we'd lose shutting the pumps down like you want to. I'm just trying to save us all a lot of time and money. Well, what you should be thinking about is saving your job. Whatever. You can't fire me. I don't even answer to you. You're a real piece of work, Dennis. You know that? Go ahead and report me. See if I care. I'm not the idiot who wants to shut down the pumps. No, you're just the idiot who didn't report the problem, and it gets worse. If you would have told me the second that you saw it, we could have worked together, saving money while saving the environment. We're lucky we don't have a complete ecological disaster on our hands. [Rumbling] Whoa! Can someone on sonar tell me what the heck that was? [Sonar tech] You don't want to know. - Now what, kid? - Well, I think we got their attention. Why don't we stick around and make sure? [Sighs] [gasping] [all sighing] - [laughter] - Tag! I'm gonna get you. There we were, face-to-face with bloodthirsty sharks. And Alex, he's so crafty, he takes after me that way, he gets the bright idea to make the sharks chase him through the jets. Because if there's one thing sharks hate, it's jets. The ash from the volcano is a great dispersant. It breaks up the goop into practically nothing. What if the black goop breaks out again? Well, now we know what to do about it. And we know right where the volcano is if ever we need it. You're back. We were so worried about you. - My little darling. - [Jeff] So worried. Mom, Dad, I'm okay, really. I'm not just a little kid anymore. Oh. I guess... I guess you're right. I still missed you guys. Hey, Eelanor. Get over here. [Groans] There's someone I want you to meet. I know she's big, but don't be scared, okay? Eelanor, Mom and Dad. Mom and Dad, Eelanor. - Um, hi. - Hello there. Any friend of Christine's is a friend of ours. You too should be super proud of your daughter. She's strong, intelligent. We really couldn't have done this without her. Thanks, Christine. I'm proud to call you my friend. His Majesty wishes to offer you his sincerest congratulations for restoring New Coralton to its former glory, for saving the lives of our citizens, and for ending the threat of this black ooze. It would be my great pleasure to thank you for following the king's orders and saving us. But I can't. [All gasp] I confess, I stood by as the king shamed this fine parrotfish for wanting to help us, to save us, and for what? Because he's a janitor. I stood by as the king ordered him to do nothing, and just hoped the problem went away on its own. I thought little of this fish. Because of his job, I thought he was beneath me. But the truth is, I'm not even fit to clean your scales. I'm unworthy. If you had done what the king said, well, things would have been a lot worse around here. I can't look you fish in the eye and keep serving a king who did nothing for his subjects when they needed him most. Truly... Truly I am the jerk face. - Paul? - Yes? I think maybe you're not the one at fault. Now, let's calm down here. I do a lot of good for you ingrates. You are a sad, strange, little fish. And you have my pity. You do! [Stammers] No! Three cheers for King Alexander! [Cheering] Thank you. Now I have to come clean with you guys. [Laughs] That's not a joke. While we were out there, my friend Ed called me out on something I didn't want to admit. - That's what good friends do. - Kid, I didn't mean... It's okay. I think I really did do it, at least in part, in the hopes that you guys would notice me. I just love this reef so much. I just wanted to feel like I made a real difference around here. I don't think you have to worry about that anymore. You're a big hero. You saved the reef. Not alone. We all helped! And I couldn't have done it without you. I don't know how comfortable I am taking the throne. But if you still want me to lead you, well, I'll be honored. The problem is, I don't know the first thing about running a city. Hey, Paul? Think you can stick around and show me the ropes?
