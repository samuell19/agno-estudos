[electronic sting] [ambient humming] [city commotion] [Woman VO] Our planet was dying but we found whatever happiness we could with those we loved and pretended it wasn't happening. I remember my last evening with my mother and daughter down by the ocean. Mom told us a story. A story about five men in a tiny boat adrift on the sea. But with only enough water and food for three to survive. How should they decide who lives and who dies? I remember her answer, but I still don't know why she told us that story. A few hours later, they were both gone. [tires squealing] [thudding, glass crunching] [police sirens blaring] [gentle music] [dramatic vocalization music] [atmosphere whooshing] - [computer chiming] - [electronic fizzling] [dramatic vocalization music] [alarm beeping] [woman sighing] [Computer] Hibernation is terminated. All crew, please proceed to your quarters. [heart monitors beeping] [woman yawning] [door clanking] [woman sighing] [machinery humming] [electrical fizzling] [gentle vocalization music] [machinery clanking] [metal door humming] [computer chiming] I'm getting too old for this shit. My head. You okay, Si? [heart monitors beeping] [woman yawning] [computer chiming] [woman yawning] [gentle music] [Computer] All crew are requested at the command deck in 30 minutes. Officer Ulph, proceed to main propulsion for spent core expulsion. Hi. Why don't you get some rest, Si? Hibernation's hard, especially the first time. You know, if you're struggling, we can give you something to settle your nerves. We all remember our first flight. Anyway... [ominous music] [Ulph sighing] [atmosphere humming] [machinery buzzing] [utensils clinking] What is it he does again? He blogs. Has a massive following, like massive. Oh. He blogs, massive following, right, useful. Leave him alone, okay? Okay? Okay. Si, can I get you anything? No, I'm fine, thank you. How are the blogs going? Good. There's a lot of interest in the mission. Cool. Well let me know if you need anything, all right? I will, thank you. [metal door rumbling] There is it. [Computer] Flight time to sphere, 16 hours, 48 minutes and 33 seconds. Eight months to get here and we finally see it with our own eyes. Have you seen the new data yet? Yeah. It's unremarkable. What? [computers chiming] [Computer] Karla Grey is recognized. Sphere data is online. [electronic humming] Holo projector is initiated. [gentle music] [atmosphere humming] [gentle vocalization music] [metal door rattling] [Sean] Wow. That thing is incredible. What's the data like? Complete shit. What, why? [Karla] Take a look. [Computer] Officer Walsh is recognized. Officer Shunzhi is recognized. Flight's trajectory is confirmed. I mean, there's nothing new here, how's that? There's nothing here, Sen. No. So what do we do, Commander? What we were sent to do. We investigate the sphere. This is bullshit! The ship's scanners are capable of dissecting entire planets. How can we not see through that thing? We don't know. Hey, Miz, what's your favorite sexual position? [Computer] I do not engage in sexual activity. Really, because you're fucking me really hard. Miz, how long until we reach objective? [Miz] Eight hours, 51 minutes and 22 seconds. We have no idea what that thing is. [ominous music] [metal creaking] [computer keys clicking] [computer chiming] [metal creaking] [computer keys clicking] [computer chiming] [Si sighing] I'm about to jettison a spent core from the propulsion. [Miz] Safety measures are initiated. [rocket whooshing] [ship rumbling] Core detonation, - ♪ Over the hills ♪ - Five. - ♪ And far away ♪ - Four. [Miz] Three. Two. One. [explosion booming] Core detonation is confirmed. All on-board systems - remain stable. - [Ulph singing indistinct] [computer chiming] Crew, CEO Vance is online. [Miz] Private executive communication is confirmed. [electrical fizzling] [gentle music] [Man on holo] Crew of the Achilles, I trust you're recovered from your long hibernation. All crew members are fully recovered, sir. The whole world is watching, waiting. Every media channel is hungry for information about the sphere. Sir, the scans are telling us nothing. The sphere represents the greatest mystery ever encountered by the human race. If our technology cannot penetrate it, we must find another way. I'm sure Miz will take the helm for a short time while you return to your quarters and speak to your family members. Thank you, sir. I'm sure we are all truly grateful. [computer buzzing] Crew dismissed. [atmosphere rumbling] [Woman] Karla? [Si gasping] [ghostly whispering] Karla? [ghostly whispering] [unsettling music] Karla? [voice off screen] Mom? [Karla gasping] [ghostly whispering] [Karla sighing] [Miz] Private executive - communication... - [Karla] Oh! - Is confirmed. - [computer chiming] I thought everyone was having their family calls now. I thought we were family... after three missions together. - Sorry, I didn't mean... - Are you okay? You seemed tense on command. Maybe I was asking too much, putting you on the flight so soon after losing them. I'm fine. Really. And I never would've gotten through without you. Without your help and without your support. I'm with you every step of the way, Karla Grey. - I'm always... - [computer fizzling] [machinery rumbling] [Miz] Space continuum anomaly detected. Source confirmed, the sphere. What the fuck? Nature of anomaly, unknown. Commander? Achilles' on board systems are compromised. Communication with earth is offline. Communication repairs are initiated. Life support systems remain stable. [dramatic music] Propulsion systems remain stable. On board data systems running at 34 percent capacity. [dramatic music] [ship whooshing] Data system repairs are initiated. All crew report to command deck immediately. [dramatic vocalization music] Miz, update. [Miz] On board data systems running at 47 percent capacity. Life support systems are stable. Propulsion systems are stable. Miz, what was the nature of the disturbance? [Miz] Unknown. [Karla] Miz, what is that light source? [Miz] Unknown. So we're flying blind and Miz is on vacation. We've never encountered anything like this before. No kidding. [metal doors clanking] [ominous music] [computer chiming] Somebody switched the light on. Like it's showing us where it wants us to go. Exactly. So what, we just fly towards that thing with no clue of what it is or what just hit us? Yes. Okay, systems are restoring. [Miz] On board data systems are fully restored and online. [electronic tune humming] What is it? [electronic tune humming] What is that? [electronic tune humming] [Miz] Data source confirmed as the sphere. [electronic tune humming] [computer chiming] [electronic tune humming] [ambient music] [electronic tune humming] [computer chiming] Miz, are these character structures correct? [Miz] The character sequences are correct. Why are we set so easy? Perhaps you will share with us what you have found. [computer chiming] What? The transmission is a message. Saying what? One word, repeated endlessly. [Sen] What word? [computer chiming] "Deus." [ominous music] "God." [dramatic vocalization music] We have to turn back. Don't you see? Don't you see what is happening? We have to turn back! Si. He's not wrong. We have to speak to Vance before we go anywhere near that thing. We lost connection with Earth after the first impact. So we stop the ship until we get communication back. Our orders are from Vance, I see no reason to change them. This is our first encounter with an extraterrestrial intelligence in the known universe, let alone, our solar system. That thing came looking for us. How do you know it isn't hostile? How do you know it's now what it says it is? [Karla] What? God. [Karla chuckling] So we're gonna take its word for it? No, we follow orders and investigate the sphere. We need time to know more, Sen. How? The scanners are blind to it. [electronic tune humming] [Si quivering] [footsteps approaching] [Karla] Si? [Si quivering] We can't go there. This is judgment. Now we pay for our sins. We don't know what the sphere is, Si. I do. I do. I hear voices. Calling. Screaming. "Judgment." Easy. Si, we're going to find out what this sphere is, okay? Just, can you tell me, what voices do you hear? We can't go near it. We have to turn back. [atmosphere whooshing] Wow. My mother always said God was gonna catch up with me one day. Big Catholic, my mother. Always made me go to church. I don't remember anything about a big, black ball in the sky though. I must've missed that song. We have to find out what this is. We're supposed to be fearless explorers. Why would God come now? Maybe he's had enough of your bullshit. Or "she" has. Ah. My mother always said "he" though. Did she also say that you always have to have the last word? [Sean] If this sphere is God, we have nothing to fear. That depends on what you've been up to. God is our judge. [gentle string music] God fucking scares me. This isn't God. You don't know that. He has a point. You don't know what this is. But I also have a point, we have to find out what this is. There's a lot of people watching us. Yeah? Yeah. And if it isn't God, we can always do something else. Like what? Blow the fucker up. We're not a military vessel. There's always a way to blow something up. Always. [Miz] All crew report to command deck immediately. Time to go, chaps. [door clanking] [gentle music] [computer chiming] [door clanking] Officer Ulph. Sir? That will be the last mention of blowing anything up. [computer chiming] Okay, flight trajectory is good. [Ulph] All good on my screen. [Sen] Proceed with final approach. [intense music] [Girl] Mom! Mom! [intense music] [Ulph] What is it? It's okay, it's in my head. [ghostly whispering] [Karla groaning] Thanks. [Karla sighing] So what happened? I get these headaches. Is that because of the accident? - Yeah. - [footsteps clanking] [Tez knocking] Sorry to interrupt. How're you feeling? I'm good, thanks. We need to find Si. He's gone deep into the heel. Fucking guy's a liability. What's he doing down there? I don't know. I think he's really scared. Okay. I'll follow you down. Sure. I'll come too. You need to rest. Nope. I'm fine. [atmosphere humming] [computer chiming] [metal door clanking] Si, can you hear me? [eerie music] [metal clanking] Fuck, this thing is slow. [ominous music] [transport whooshing] [metal rumbling] You said you heard something before Tez interrupted us. Did I? I don't remember. [atmosphere humming] Si? [metal clanking] Split up, cover more ground. You take three, I'll take four. Sure. [atmosphere rumbling] [Si muttering] [demonic whispering] [atmosphere humming] Where are you? [Karla] Moving through three. Anything? [Karla] Nothing yet. [electronic fizzling] [demonic screaming] [gentle vocalization music] [Si] It's okay. We all need to be cleansed. [Tez screaming] Did you hear that? Yeah. Sounded like Tez. Sounded like it came from the lower hold. Okay, I'll meet you there. [sinister music] [steam hissing] I think I'm close. Where? I'm in the lower hold now. I'm a minute away. Wait for me. [suspenseful tempo music] - [Si huffing] - [intense music] [suspenseful tempo music] Karla! Karla! Where are you? [suspenseful tempo music] [intense music] Karla? [Karla yelping] [Karla] Stop! [Karla whimpering] Stay the fuck away from me! Take one fucking step and I'm gonna cut her throat! Easy, son. No one's gonna hurt you. We just need to talk. We are beyond redemption. Nothing can save us from His wrath. If we land on that sphere, we're lambs to the slaughter. We have to turn the ship around. Si, Si, Si, Si, Si. Let's go and talk to the commander, we can turn this ship around. Right, Sen? - Don't fucking patronize me! - [ominous music] We have to take charge of the ship. We have to kill that fucker, he knows something. Okay, so, let's ask him what he knows, together. You're lying. Easy, Si. [gunshot booming] [Karla gasping] It's okay. It's over, you're safe now. Officer Ulph, you're gonna need a body bag to get Rubbin to the hold. Where's Tez? She's in the hold. I think she's dead. That's two body bags we're gonna need. This shouldn't have been allowed to happen. Officer Grey, follow me. [Karla huffing] [eerie music] [Karla groaning] [metal door clanking] The sphere, Sen, you know something. If we knew what the sphere was, Vance would've told you himself. He wouldn't keep it away from you, of all people. We can't explain how it appeared or its origin. Only what it says it is. God. Yes. I don't believe in God. You are an explorer, you have been journeyed into the unknown all of your life, but this mystery has got you running scared. I am not running. That's exactly what you are doing. That's the last thing that Vance would expect you to do. People are trusting you, as are billions back on Earth. [transport whooshing] [Sen groaning] [buttons beeping] [gentle music] [Sen whistling] This is your time. Embrace it. I'm sorry, before you launch into another one of your speeches, I'm sure millions of people will enjoy watching, could we just take second to take in what has happened on this mission? The whole world is watching, Karla Grey. I don't give a fuck! So we're just gonna ignore what happened with Tez. Si, who should have never been on board this ship to begin with. Tell Vance that you are too afraid. I'm sure he'll tell the rest of us, once Miz reestablishes contact with Earth. Great. Hmmm. [buttons beeping] [metal doors buzzing] You coming? I'm gonna give myself permission to go and clean up for a bit and then go and say goodbye to Tez. You can't help her now. Holy fuck. Don't take too long. [ambient humming] [gentle music] [Ulph] Time for us all to meet our maker. [Karla] Time for answers. We owe her that, don't we? Yeah. Yeah. [gentle music] [computer chiming] [Miz] Flying time to sphere, three hours, 17 minutes and 13 seconds. [computer chiming] Ready to disengage Achilles. Proceed. [machinery humming] [somber vocalization music] Wait. [computer chiming] There's something down there. A structure. What is it? [computer beeping] [atmosphere humming] [Achilles rumbling] [electrical fizzling] [mechanical buzzing] [Miz] Communication with Earth is restored. CEO Vance is online. [Sen] Sir. Here, we arrive at an extraordinary moment in our history. A moment like no other. Officers Grey and Ulph, you carry with you the blessings and good wishes of all the peoples of the earth, as do the entire crew of the brave Achilles. Sir, we have new data from the surface. I'm aware. You should know that some of the structures have now appeared all over the earth. What? How many on Earth? [Vance] In excess of ten thousand. Oh. It's an invasion. What are my peers saying, sir? Members of the scientific community on Earth, what are they saying about those structures? We're just four people up here, going in blind. What the fuck are they saying? Nothing. The origin and purpose of these structures remains a mystery. They still have to be considered a threat. We have concluded that the sphere is at the center of this mystery. It must be investigated. And you must lead this investigation. [electrical fizzling] We have to find out what the fuck this is. Agreed. Officer Ulph and Grey, I need you to proceed to the airlock. We have to go out there. I'm going with you. No, you're not. Yeah, I am. I'm the only other scientist on board. He's right. And I want him out there. We need as many eyes on this thing as we can get. [metal door buzzing] [ambient humming] - [Karla breathing] - [metal clicking] We ready? Getting there. You're good, all set? Let's go. [Miz] Airlock compression is complete. Crew are cleared to proceed. [metal door buzzing] [alarm beeping] [gentle music] [metal doors buzzing] The inner airlock door is secured. Decompression is initiated. [alarm beeping] Outer airlock doors are open. [Ulph] Come. [Miz] Crew are clear to proceed. [eerie ambient music] - [alarm beeping] - [doors humming] Outer airlock doors are secured. [Karla heavily breathing] [eerie ambient music] [electronic chiming] [Sean] Are you getting anything? Not a thing. [eerie ambient music] Well... my guess is, this is not on the Periodic Table. [Sen] What about the structure? [eerie music] Looks like a gate to me. [ominous music] Oh, come on. What now? "What now," indeed. [ominous music] I hope Si was wrong. 'Cause we're at the mercy out here. Huh? Let's move on. [eerie music] [flare whooshing] Look. Up at the top. [flare whooshing] We know that symbol. What is that? The Event Horizon. What does that mean? The edge of existence. [ambient music] These gates appear to be made of the same material... as the sphere. If that is a gate, where does it lead? [dramatic ambient music] [metallic whooshing] What the? And how are we hearing that in a vacuum? [Sen] Miz is receiving this transmission and relaying it to you. But it's a different word to the last. What word? [Miz] "Welcome." [atmosphere whooshing] [gentle music] [Karla] Miz? [Sen] Miz is translating. This is incredible. Miz, translation? [Miz] "You have come." Speak to it. Say something. [Miz] "I speak for the Creator." Who is the Creator? [Miz] "The beginning and end. "The alpha and omega of all existence." And why has the Creator come? [Miz] "As a warning and to help." Help, how? [Miz] "Humankind faces a choice." What choice? [Miz] "Those who enter the gates like this one "will return to the Creator in eternal peace. "You must show the way." Who must show the way? [Miz] "You are the one sent. "It is you who will see the truth beyond the gate "and you will return to share the truth with all humankind." Karla, you have clearance to proceed. What is beyond the gate? [Miz] "The end of all suffering. "The end of all pain." You said humankind faced a choice. What is the alternative? [Miz] "Those who do not choose to enter the gate "will perish." Perish, how? [Miz] "The sphere also carries the Event Horizon. "As the sphere reaches Earth, "it will being the most destructive force "in the entire universe. "In an instant, Earth and all those left on it "will cease to exist." A black hole. [Miz] "Only those who pass through the gates "will be saved. "Only they will find salvation. "Only they will find the ones they have lost." [atmosphere whooshing] Mom? [Karla whimpering] Another waits for you beyond the gate. [atmosphere humming] [Karla panting] - [car rumbling] - [glass clinking] [dramatic vocalization music] [atmosphere humming] Jess? Baby! [dramatic music] [dramatic music intensifying] [atmosphere whooshing] [alarm beeping rapidly] [Miz] Current heart rate tachycardia, 152 beats per minute. - Blood pressure, 143 over 94. - [Karla vomiting] - Respiratory rate, 28. - [Karla groaning] Easy. Easy. [Miz] No physical trauma is detected. Karla? [Karla groaning] You're okay. What? How'd I get back here? You came out of the gate. You could barely stand. - I helped you back to the ship. - [ominous music] And what about Sean? He didn't make it. Mm-mmm. No, what, no. No, no, no, no. No. Oh my god, what is going on? We're all asking the same question. - [computer chiming] - [Karla] Where is Vance? [Vance] I'm here. [Karla] I need to speak to you. We need to know what was beyond the gate. The whole world is waiting on your answer. [Karla sighing] I saw a golden landscape. [gentle music] A beautiful... golden landscape. And off in the distance, there was a city with domes and towers glinting in the sunlight. Like a bloody new Jerusalem. Like... Heaven. [Vance] What happened next? I ran toward the city. [gentle piano music] And then... Um... Then I was back here. I heard you whisper your mother's name before you entered the gate. Ugh. Um... I... I don't remember. [Sen] Easy. No. There was no one else. [Vance] Try to remember. There was nothing else. Okay? You need to rest. [computer chiming] [metal door thudding] What happened to Sean? [ominous tempo music] His suit ruptured. There was nothing we could do. Ruptured? Explorer suits don't rupture. His glove wasn't secured properly. He decompressed. There was nothing we could do. [Karla sniffling] It was quick. I wanted him out there. Sean was an experienced explorer. He knew how to fit a suit. He made a mistake. He was in too much of a rush to get out there. Vance is right, you need to rest. I have to get back down to the sphere. [ominous tempo music] We need more answers. Well... You can't. We're already prepping to leave orbit, so... Why would we leave without answers? You do need to rest. You'd be more comfortable in your own quarters. Come. [foreboding music] I'm good from here. Thanks. No cameras here. Why do they think that you held something back? [somber music] I don't know what to trust anymore. [computer chiming] [gentle music] I saw something. What? You know I lost them, my family. Yeah. I was in a coma for weeks, head injuries, four surgeries later, I walked out of the hospital but they didn't make it. [gentle piano music] I saw them, at the gate. He knows what I saw. I could see it in his eyes and I could hear it in his questions and he wanted me to say it for the camera. He knows something about what this is. So why isn't he telling us? [ominous music] [atmosphere rumbling] [Miz] Achilles will disengage from the sphere's orbit in 30 minutes. [mechanical doors buzzing] [somber music] How is she? Exhausted. Did she say anything else? No. You went out of view. She didn't say anything. Prepare to leave orbit. [Ulph] Confirmed. [computer chiming] [ship rumbling] [computer chiming] We need her to tell us everything about what she saw. She's holding back. You heard what I heard. You're getting way to close to this woman. Remember your orders, why you are on this ship. I'm crystal clear. Remain so. [Miz] Crew will assemble in hibernation in one hour. [lively tempo music] [airlock hissing] [ominous music] [lively tempo music] [electrical fizzling] [door clanking] It appears Officer Grey has broken into my quarters. [lively tempo music] - [Karla grunting] - [metal clanking] [suspenseful music] [sinister music] [gun cranking] What the fuck are you doing? What I told you I was going to do. Question. And I got some great answers about you. Eight years Special Air Corps, four years with the Elite Corps, decorated more times than you can probably even remember. You weren't just good, you were one of the best. It was a different life. What're you doing on this ship? I was told to keep the peace. That was it. What do you know about the sphere? Nothing. You know more than I do. You went through the gate. I don't believe you. There's nothing I can do about that. Okay, move. Where are we going? Move. [gentle tempo music] [atmosphere whooshing] [Sen sighing] This is mutiny. That's a death sentence back on Earth. Well, apparently, the sphere is the death sentence for an entire planet, so, it's time for the truth. Well you already have it. You saw what was beyond the gate. Okay, I'll start, shall I? Sean... was murdered. Oh yeah, I saw the suit, there's nothing wrong with it. He was shot. - [ominous tempo music] - You killed him. You're a hitman. Hired to clean up any problems. But why? I want the truth. They all want the truth, I'm pretty sure you'll cut this part out though. Tell them what you saw beyond the gate. You know what I saw and so does Vance. How? - [computer chiming] - [electronic fizzling] [Karla gasping] We believe that what you saw was real. That you glimpsed Heaven. That was not Heaven. Then what was it? Even a scientist must believe her own eyes. We're not your enemies. Your enforcer will kill me the first chance he gets. [Vance] Why would I seek to harm you, of all people? - [ominous music] - You stay away from me! This cannot be stopped. Besides, people have already started to make their own choice. [TV Announcer] ...Have appeared all over the world. It is estimated... [Vance] The earth has become a living hell. People want to escape. Escape to paradise. - Holy shit. - [dramatic music] This has to be stopped. [Sen groaning] [gunshot booming] [Sen laughing] You won't. [gunshot booming] [Karla groaning] Am I next? [Karla] What are you doing? I'm not doing anything, Karla. Not even I can stop what's happening. You need help. And then I'll take this ship anywhere you wanna go. Sure. Why would you do that? You killed Sean. Yeah. Yeah. And now... Now you're gonna kill me. No. You're not the only one who wants the truth. When I stepped on this ship, I had no idea where all this was going. I don't know what the sphere is. [Karla groaning] Okay. [ship rumbling] [Karla groaning] You were lucky. Just a flesh wound. Yeah. Lucky. [gentle music] I wanna go back to the sphere. But Vance has control of Miz. I have the code to override her. We would have to lose the heel. She's too big to control manually. So, we'd lose main propulsion and... our way back to Earth. Achilles propulsion should make it but it would take a long time. How long? Five, six years. More, I'm guessing. We're not going to get to go home, are we? It's not looking good. There is something else we could do. [mechanical doors buzzing] [doors clanking] [computer chiming] Karla. You intend to return to the sphere. I do. Or destroy it if you try to stop me. Why? Because this whole thing is a lie. What are you doing? I gave the world a scientist who would discover God. Cut the bullshit, what is this? You did not discover God. But you could now become God. And what does that mean? Go to your screen. Okie-doke. [computer chiming] [Miz] Achilles files classified. Sphere schematics accessed. [Vance] A self replicating material called Bio-Mech 34987, capable of building huge structures to a preconceived design very quickly. The patent of the advanced Achilles program which I am very proud. You built this? [ominous music] [transport whooshing] Why? I'll tell you a story about a once beautiful planet that sits at the center of the Milky Way. The planet that was the jewel in the crown of the known universe. The planet whose beauty was beyond comparison and then came human beings and over tens of thousands of years this planet was brought to the very point of extinction. 21 billion people now cram into the 15 percent of the Earth's service that is still habitable. Scientists tell us that within 30 years this planet will die. The human race must be culled. The many sacrificed to save the few or we all die. So, people enter the gates on Earth and go to their deaths but you tell them that it's God? Well? You got me to do that for you for you. To save the few. How many do you plan to kill? In excess of 15 billion, saving six billion. So this... is your final solution? How do they die? Each gate houses a contained Event Horizon. [Karla sighing] They step into oblivion. It's quite painless. Instant non-existence. Another Vance Achilles patent, no doubt. The figure at the gate said that the sphere would destroy the earth. The sphere has no destructive capabilities. It was conceived to appear as a threat. - As a judgment. - [ominous music] Well then, people would discover the lie. Before it reaches the earth, the sphere will self-destruct. A coordinated military strike credited with its destruction. By then, billions will already be dead. The sphere's secret hidden forever. If we do nothing, the planet will die. There will be no one left. How did I see what was beyond the gate? My mother, and then Jess. Listen. [Jess] Mom! [Mother] Karla? After your accident, we placed a chip in your head which would be activated for this mission. Through which we could get you to see or hear whatever we wanted. [ominous music] And you woke me before I could reach her. You've been preparing me for this trip for two years. You arranged the accident so you could put this thing in my head. You murdered my family to save the few? Yes. Everything you are for me... is a lie. [suspenseful tempo music] [computer chiming] [gentle music] I miss my mum. And I wish she was here. She would tell you a story. [Vance] What story? It's a goodie. Five men adrift on the ocean with only enough food and water for three to survive, so two have to die. Exactly. Your mother understood. Yeah, well, she was a very smart lady. But that's not how her story ends. You see, she understood something that you don't. They could find fish or an island to sustain them or even a ship could come. No one knows what the ocean will bring. All of us deserve to find our own future. Is this your final solution? You're... a fucking... monster. [suspenseful tempo music] [metal whooshing] [metal thudding] I armed the core. Then you leave me no choice. Ulph? You need to get back to the Achilles and bring the core with you now! Why? What's happening up there? Just get back here. But I can't detonate the core remotely from the Achilles. I understand that. Miz, begin the auto destruct of the ship. Sequence code 21397. [alarm beeping] [Miz] Achilles self-destruct sequence is initiated. Achilles will self-destruct in three minutes. Holy shit. Fuck this. [Vance] Ulph will not make it back in time. Besides, Miz will prevent you from disengaging the Achilles from the heel. I will ask you this one more time. Will you help me in this great cause? No one gets to play Deus. [alarm beeping] Goodbye, Karla Grey. My second greatest creation. [dramatic music] [gunshot booming] [electrical fizzling] [Miz] Achilles will self-destruct in two minutes. Ulph, where are you? I'm near transit. You have under two minutes! Yeah, I heard that, thanks. Hey, listen to me. Go to my station and bring up the ship's docking schematic. Can you find that? [Karla] I'm on it! Bring up the manual override and it will ask you for a code. [suspenseful music] Move, you fucker. I'm in but I don't have a code. I do. [Miz] Achilles will self-destruct... - Ready? - Yes. ...In one minute. Code is, zero, zero, seven, six, five, seven, eight, six, five, 89, 73. [Miz] Manual control of the Achilles is confirmed. Okay, we're in. Okay. We can separate the ship now. You need to get back here. No shit! [Miz] Achilles will self-destruct in 30 seconds. [suspenseful music] I'm not gonna make it back. You have to go. I'm waiting for you. You can't. [Miz] Achilles will self-destruct in ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero.
