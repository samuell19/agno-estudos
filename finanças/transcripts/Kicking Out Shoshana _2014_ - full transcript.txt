Shushan was knocked over outside the penalty area, the Jerusalem Sons are awarded a free kick. Shimoni goes to kick the ball. He elevates the ball. Baludo with a header. Ami Shushan takes the ball and... Goal!!! What a kick! What a move! What a shot! 3:0 to the Jerusalem Sons. 3 goals by Ami Shushan, undoubtedly the best striker in the league today. "Shushan you are the sun, the moon, the universe "That is why I now know "Without you, Ami Shushan, I am nothing!" You guys are going straight to The Eurovision song contest, no wonder they call you the chocolate, mint and gum trio. How are you, Nechama? Did the bus Brought you straight from the faggot's park? Actually I just came from the zoo, they're missing three monkeys. Hey, you're lucky I'm in a good mood. -Be quiet, chocolate, sit down. "I love the Jerusalem Sons, and all the rest can suck my dick "Not Tel Aviv and not Haifa "Jerusalem is number one!" Good evening, Mr. Shushan. -How're you doing? What's up? -Fine. Listen you gotta change that airplane move that you do. What is this, the 90s? What's up with that? What's wrong with it? It's outdated, I'm telling you this as your agent. We wanna turn you into a brand, you gotta change the move. I always do that move, it's part of who I am, you want me to change who I am? You know what the hottest move is in Brazil? -No. Whoever scores a goal does the snake dance. Pass me the ball. -What ball? -Pass me the ball... He scores, runs to the crowd and... Snake, snake... Snake... -Cut it out, people are looking! You score and you got 20 thousand people going... snake, snake... -What is this? It's viral! -Viral?! It'll ruin my career, are you nuts? You want me to score and shake in the middle of the stadium? Hey, Yigall -Hey, champ, you comin' in? -No, thanks, man, we got somewhere to be. To celebrate Shushan's goals today, chasers on the house! You see? Whoa, get a load of her. -What a bomb. Looks like she's waiting for someone. Waiting for you, what're you waiting for? Go on. What's up, Shushan? I'm doing great bro, but this is bad timing. Give the man some privacy, what's with the camera, dude? Privacy? You asked me to come. Go over to her. Are you nuts? He doesn't know that. Am I gonna see any action or what? You want a picture in the paper, there better be something, coz Shushan hangin' out with Dede, that's not very sexy. Hello, are you an immigrant or a tourist? What language is that? -Sorry, my mistake, your beauty threw me off balance, I thought you're a foreigner. Thank you. Ami Shushan. I know. I'm Mirit. No, let me. Gimme the camera! Whoa... Shushan's new girlfriend. Print that in the paper! What's going on here? -Dede, come on... What's wrong with you? You have no idea what you just did. What? Mirit. -Go away, you got me in enough trouble as it is. I didn't know about the photographer, Dede, my lame agent set it up. You have no idea what you're getting into. You're going too far. You don't want the photos published? They won't be, trust me. You better hope they won't. Now get outta here 'coz you'll be in trouble, if you stayed You hear me? -You're overreacting. This is Jerusalem, who's gonna touch me in Jerusalem? I just came here to apologize, can I do that? Ok Great, now leave. Okay, but can I have your phone number, Facebook, email? Maybe your ID number? I'm not giving up so easy on a beautiful face like you. Dede, what...? Good evening, Shushan. You don't look so good, can I get you something to drink? Sammy, get the man something to drink. -Sure thing. No, no, no, what's with you?! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey! Stop it! What're you doing?! Stop it, what's with you? Tell me something, Ami Shushan, Didn't your mother teach you not to steal women from strangers? It was a misunderstanding. It was my dumbass agent. -Oh yeah? I swear, those pictures won't get out. I know. Because We have them. Let's just say the only pictures that photographer will ever see are X-Rays of himself. Great! Problem solved, right? -Sure. Problem solved. No problem! Hey! What is this?! You faggot, you think you gonna get your picture taken with Blackie Bukovza's girlfriend? You think you can put a hand on her, you think you can get her number? Huh?! Do you know what happened to the last person who did half of what you did? I took of one his balls. Sammy, pliers. I'm sorry. -No! Gimme the pliers. Uh, Blackie... I mean, Mr. Bukovza, you can't cut one of my balls. I'm the striker for the Jerusalem Sons. So what? Does that make you a man? You players are all pussies, rubbing cream and shaving your body,you fags. Hey, cut it out. With all due respect, don't call me a fag. chill. Don't tell me to chill! Get up. Get up! Pull your pants down. -What?! Pull your pants down. -You don't mean that. Pull down your pants. Pull down your pants! Pull them down! Blackie, please... Mr. Bukovza, I have an illustrious career. No, please, Blackie... -Sshhh... Calm down. I won't cut your ball. That's Sammy's job. Sammy! Please do. -My pleasure. No, stop, no, that's enough! Blackie, think of something else. -Hurry up. Some kinds of other punishment, something educational... Sammy, Sammy, hold up. An educational punishment? -Yes...Yes. Okay... In 3 days you convene a press conference, live on air, you get on the platform and you make an announcement, "I am Ami Shushan, striker for the Jerusalem Sons, "and I'm gay- "I don't like women, I only like men." You got that? A fag. That way no one will suspect you of touching my Mirit. A fag? At Teddy stadium? Think what it'll do to Jerusalem! The spectators, the fans, the club! I don't give a rat's ass about the team or the fans. What'll this do to me? People saw you! People will talk! You know who Blackie Bukovza is? He's a brand name in Jerusalem. -And its surroundings. You'll make me look like a fag? No way. And if I catch you one more time hanging around Mirit, you're a dead man. Three days, live broadcast, you're a fag. A fag? A fag at Teddy stadium? I heard about Blackie ruthless, but this?! How the hell did you get mixed up in this?! Are you crazy? Who the hell got me into this mass? Who decided to direct gossip photos? Me? Do you remember Liam Bar Califa? -Who? -Exactly, who. Bar Califa, he was the country's best full-back. But I didn't invest a dime in gossip, not a dime! Today he's Coaching In a 10th rate Orthodox team. You wanna end up like him? A 10th rate Orthodox team?! More like the women's league! And even then I'll be the only one who's not into girls. "Not into girls"... I'm already talking like a fag. Ok, relax and listen to what your agent has to say. No way in the world we're having that press conference! You hear!? We now join the press conference convened by Ami Shushan. Based on leaked information he's about to sign an unprecedented contract with Paris St. Germain. Ami is a French citizen, he used to live in France with his mother when he was as a child. Here's Ami now. Ami, are you really transferring to Paris St. Germain? Ami Shushan! Stay home, Ami Shushan! Ami Shushan, come here! Ami Shushan, stay here! Ami Shushan, we love you! We love you! Shushan, you're king! Good Luck. Good evening, esteemed reporters, Jerusalem Sons family, management, players, fans... -Way to go, Shushan! Entire country. For 3 years I've been starring in the Jerusalem Sons and the premier league and thanks to my successes I've become a role model aiming... That's "among"... -What? The youths of Israel. Among the youths who admire and look up to me there are those with a different lifestyle and diverse sexual orientations. It is for them and for the entire community that I decided to openly announce that I am... a proud homosexual. What are you? -A homo, you know, a faggot. Don't ever say that, Shushan. Never say that!! -Gentlemen, hold on. Gentlemen, this is an historic moment. The first soccer player in the world to come out of the closet is one of ours. Israeli through and through, blue, white... pink, purple... and all the colors of your flag, a cultural hero... -Why, God, why?! Gentlemen... -Why did you do this God?! Why, you fag, why?! You see the images and hear the commotion. This is a rough day for Jerusalem Sons fans. Okay, we're back, with me is our sports analyst Dan Fuchs. Fuchsie, we still have to digest what we just heard, but no doubt about it, this is one brave player. You say "brave," I say idiot! Even more of an idiot than we thought, this doesn't make sense! Do you know of any other global player who came out like this? Yes. There was a goalie in the Japanese league. Right after he came out, he committed hara-kiri, on live TV. This is not much different than what we just saw here. This is suicide! -Wow, those are some harsh words. Time for a commercial break, we'll be right back, don't go anywhere. Hello Nisso, it's Fuchsie. Where... -This is Muki, his substitute. His substitute? Where's Nisso? He got caught and beat up. I'm the magazine's Paparazzi from now on. Muki Hochman, how do you do? By the way, I've heard a great deal about you, I love your work. -Cut out the sentimental mush, did you see what Shushan did? -Of course, everyone's shocked. Listen up, Mr. Hochman, from now on your job is to stay close to Shushan's ass, and given the circumstances, I mean it literally. This is a gold mine. -Okay, I'm on my way. What a grand day this is. Fuck. Where are you going? I don't bite... Actually, I can imagine you biting on a few things. I get you, man, I do. But it's complicated, one day I'll tell you the whole story. So you been playin' us all these years... Models in nightclubs, threesomes with flight attendants... They were male flight attendants, huh? -Hey, relax. I'm outta here, you can piss with no fear. Good. And what about training camp in Germany, huh? When you wanted to take a shower with me "so we wouldn't waste good hot water"... Are you attracted to me, Shushan? Is that what this is? Am I your type? Shushan, you wanna "do" me? Huh?! I need a drink. How about you? -No, thanks. Thanks for staying with me. -You bet. If I got mixed up with a Mafioso who was forcing me to pose as gay wouldn't you do the same? -Yeah, this could happen to anyone. Totally. I'm staying over, we'll talk this through, I have a few ideas. You're such a good friend. Can I sleep on the couch? No way, I'm taking the couch, you'll sleep in the bed. I'll get a sheet. - Okay. When I was 7 years old, before I went to France with my mother, my father took me to a Jerusalem Sons game. I sat in the bleachers behind the goalpost, the goalie was Romanian. -Right. My dad cursed him out the entire game. "You queer! You fag! Go Suck Romanian cock!" I said, Dad, what're you swearing at him for, he's on our team. He grabbed my hand, all keyed up, and said: "This guy? "He lets balls through like a faggot "and faggots don't have the right to wear the Jerusalem uniform." Two days later, he died. Two days later? -That was his legacy to me. I'm shocked. What will I do now, Dede? The season's ruined, no premier league... What will we do? -Hey, relax, listen to me. If you keep scoring till the end of the season, people will forget all about this. Look at me. Who people? The players don't want anything to do with me. People are in shock, you dropped a bombshell. Your aim is to finish a great season, people will forgive you for being a fag. Now You calling me a fag too? -I want you to get used to it. Besides, it's not that bad. A gay soccer player... It's genius. Imagine the media buzz. They'll write about you 4 times more than they do now. You'll appeal to the non-male audience. Women, gays, leftists. Female leftists. -You said it. You know what, I never did it with a female leftist... You tell those girls that you play for Jerusalem Sons and they're outta there. That's why I wanted them even more. -Of course you did. What female leftists? Male leftists, maybe. You have to start somewhere... "Daily Sports: Shocker. Soccer legend comes out of the closet" Ami! What's going on? Sonofabitch. That's good, Shushan, hold his hand. I smell a scoop, Shushan. Shushan, wait up. -Mirit, you wanna get me killed? I've been coming here for 3 days hoping to bump into you. Stop, you have no idea how guilty I feel. -Then don't. It's all my fault, okay? He may introduce me as his lover but we're not a couple. We were neighbors, he got a crush on me when I was a soldier. Since then he can't let go. He buys me presents, pays my rent... Great, a genuine angel... I know what he expects in return. -Too bad you give it to him. Too bad you don't have more self esteem. It's not as if I have a choice. My folks... -I feel for you, I do, but why are you telling me this? Because I want to start over. -What's that got to do with me? I liked you that night before this whole thing started. You look like a good person. Not to mention you're real hot. And you're a soccer player. I'm crazy about soccer players. I wish I could be with you and not with him. It won't work, Mirit. He'll see to that. I'm sorry. I really am. Hey, champ! Thanks to you we changed our concept. Hey sisters, in honor of Shushan's coming out, chasers on the house. Well, Sharabani, so it's our fault again, huh? That press conference was a catastrophe. Since then Shushan thinks that "she's" a primadonna. "She" won't fuckin' play for the Jerusalem Sons. I think you're making a mistake. We shouldn't play into our enemies' hands. What do you think we should do? -We'll back him up. We'll even let him play on Saturday. He'll want to leave of his own accord and we'll issue a statement that we're not stopping him, that we respect him and his lifestyle... That way we seem "enlightened" to the Tel Aviv media. I'm not so sure, the fans could burn down the stadium. He'll play the last 5 minutes, but he has to play on Saturday. -5 minutes? -Yes. 5 minutes, not 6. Those Neanderthals. Oh my God. Mama... Hi, Mom. -Hi, honey. Mom is crazy about you and accepts you no matter what. What, you heard the news in France? -What did you think? But don't be ashamed, dear, you can tell me anything. Thank God you have a modern mom. -Mom, it's not exactly... Tell me, sweetie, are you active or passive? No, no, I'm neither. Where's that coming from? Not active and not passive? Are you versatile? -Versatile? I googled it, sweetie, I know the lingo. I never thought my son would turn out a pansy. But, that's life, my son. Lucky for you your father's dead, he wasn't as modern as me. Do you have a boyfriend or are you searching on "Gay Romeo?" I've been waiting for this moment. May the games begin. Please stand and let's have a minute of silence in memory of Issac Davidoff, chairman of Jerusalem Sons. "No entry to fags" Shushan, you should have worn a pink ribbon, you jerk! The man had a heart condition, you pervert! The crowd doesn't care what's happening on the field. All this crowd wants to do is provoke Ami Shushan. "Not Tel Aviv or Haifa "Jerusalem is a champ." Jerusalem Sons: 0 Hapoel Beer Sheva: 1 87 minutes into the game, Hapoel is still in the lead. Everyone wants to know if Ami Shushan will play and save the Jerusalem Sons. Wait, it seems he's going in. He's up off the bench. Ami Shushan, the proud gay striker for Jerusalem Sons is getting ready to join the game. Maya and the TV crew, please get closer to the stands to capture the audience reaction. Faggot, faggot, faggot! This is improper unworthy, although quite expected. This is Ami Shushan's first attack. Impressive double pass, but Shushan prefers to go solo, he falls and loses the ball. There is no whistle for an offense. Looks like Shushan is not on his game. This is not the player we know. You are not Shushan, you are Shoshana! Shoshana! Shoshana! Shoshana! Move to the stands, look what's going on. Start taking pictures. I want ugly, I want nasty, I want scum. Do it, Muki. Shoshana! Shoshana! Shoshana! Shoshana! There's the final whistle. A scathing loss for the Jerusalem Sons. One can assume that Shushan will go through some Difficult moments now. With everything that's going on... What were you talking about? Men's talk, dude. Nothing to do with you. Why're you just standing there, bro? -He is waiting for the shower. Is that it? Monsumbo! Get over here. You shower, show him your thing, he'll be happy. I'm done with you guys. You don't exist for me. You're invisible. You killed Isaac, you wanna kill us too? Hey, bro, take it easy. I'm kidding, dude. Shushan, why're you all sensitive like a girl? Get over here! -Get over here, Shoshana! We wanna talk to you! Come here a sec. Get over here! He hitched a ride with Nechama. I bet they're having an affair. What's wrong with you, crying like some fag? You ganging up on me too? -I'm kidding. I'm gay too. You're gay and you're a fan of our team? No, a gay player is better... You're right. Thanks for the rescue. -No problem. I wanna apologize for those beasts, they're the noisy few... You're telling me what the fans can be like? But a gay fan, this is a first for me. How is it you're a soccer fan of the Jerusalem Sons? You know... a soccer team is like one's sexual orientation, you can't change. I used to be religious. My first sexual encounter was with my rabbi. Oh my God. A stud rabbi.. I flirted with him all year until finally the student topped the rabbi. How about you? -What about me? Tell me about your first sexual encounter. It happened when I was 14, with the girl next door. I mean the boy next door... and the girl next door. A threesome at 14 years old?! -Yeah. -You go, girl! That's some start. You mind if I put some music on? -No, go for it. I wanted him to show His love for me With a kiss... Given yesterday's grave incident at Teddy Stadium, Ami Shushan, the Jerusalem Sons striker announced that he's suspending himself until further notice. Shushan has a contract with the team, who knows what his season will be like. The Maccabi Tel Aviv striker announced... Mirit? We discussed this, I hope you're alone. You think I'd get you in trouble, of course I'm alone. I was just passing by and I saw you. I'm happy to see you. You look good in jeans. Honey, I know what you're going through, you look good in jeans too, but we can't be seen together. It's dangerous. Then you don't really know what I'm going through. Oh no, what's he doing here?! -Just my luck. Take this. Take this. Damn, he's coming this way. Yigau We can't keep you waiting in line. Come in. -Thanks. Mister, wait in line. -Oh, I'm sorry. Itk a million years old So fresh at sunrise She becomes veiled when a cloud goes by Like a woman proud of her beauty She rises, rises round and large With fire she excites the sky Red and hot Harnessed to a chariot of fire The sun queen. Even in men's sunglasses and cap you look sexy. She rises, rises round and large With fire she excites the sky Red and hot Harnessed to a chariot of fire She rises, rises round and large With fire she excites the sky Red and hot Harnessed to a chariot of fire The sun queen. Four losses since I stopped playing. They're crumbling. They may be crumbling but they haven't contacted us except of lawsuits... What about the other clubs? -Nothing. There's not one owner in the premier league who's man enough to have a fag on his team. Not even Pink Hapoel? -No, you're persona non grata. Mr. Shushan? Ami Shushan? -What's up? We're in the middle here, can we do this later? Forgive me for barging in, but I wanted to meet you, I'm Hilik Eliraz, chairman of the Open House for Pride and Tolerance. What tolerance? My friend, we're in the middle of something. Can we set up an appointment? For your ears only? I'm his eyes, ears and mouth. It's just that it's between me and him, I can't talk in front of better halves. No, no... -No, no. Hey, what's with you? He's my agent. -I'm his agent, okay? -My agent. Say what you have to say. -Excellent. The Open House is launching an unprecedented campaign. We got funding from the RJGA, an American reform gay association, they're giving us a lot of money to promote Jerusalem's gay community. Great. Kudos. Good luck. I've had enough... Hold on there, he said there's money in it... As I was saying, we're seeking a famous person to head the campaign, for a fee, of course. The first name that came to mind was yours. Your coming out as a soccer player was incredibly groundbreaking. You're a pioneer, a striker. Number one striker in the league. That too. Thank for the compliments, man, but I'm not... Give me your phone number, I'll get back to you. Here you go. Are you nuts? All he's asking is that you play gay, people think you are one anyways, it's publicity, it's money. No one's paying you to play soccer... -No. Don't be so narrow minded. This is your revenge on Blackie. He'll see you making big bucks, he'll freak. Listen to Dede. I'm not interested. What's that noise? -Mice, I think. I made us an appointment for Dr. Boobs. Monday at 12. Dr. Shiran, the plastic surgeon? You made an appointment without asking me? Since when do I ask anyone anything? But this is my body. -Now I'm insulted. I'm giving you a 20 thousand dollar boob job and you give me an ass look? Why are we doing this? I told you I don't want to do it. Babe, I look at you and you know what I see? I see an amazing apartment, a real gem, but no sun balcony. Balconies are standard. He just wants to measure you... Hey, Mirit. Shut up. Shut up. I'll pay, Blackie. I'll pay, Blackie. - But when? Gimme one more week. -One more week you say? See you next week. -Up. One more week. Ami Shushan? Yes, how can I help you? I'm Avishag and this is Abigail. We wanted to tell you how much we admire what you did. Thank you. Are you Jerusalem Sons fans? -No. -No. We're not into soccer. -We're MA students. Psychology. Wow, I love psychologists. -No way. Yeah, once they brought a psychologist to the team after the youth club burned down, the men were distressed so... -Did it help? No, she collapsed. They admitted her, she couldn't take the heat. But she was so cute. -Poor thing. We're not into sports. But gay men... We're writing our thesis on homosexuality based on Freud's psychosexual model. Have you ever heard of Freud? Of course. Obviously. But...in his early days, before he became famous... Gays always turned us on. With all the machismo and militarism these days, gay men are so much more distinguished. -We're crazy about gay men. Too bad it's a fantasy that can never come true. Why not? Abigail... Never say never. What's it like having sex with women? -It's the bomb. I mean, not like my first time with a man, but... surprising. How was it for you? -Amazing. Are you sure you're gay? Huh? Sorry, I gotta take this, it's my fiance. Paradise, hello. -Paradise? Life's a paradise, isn't it? Whatever. What about the campaign, you give it any thought? Didn't you settle it? Call him now. It's midnight, what's wrong with you? Let's just say that paradise is in a different time zone. Two days ago you were against it, now you're gung ho? Two days ago I wasn't aware of the benefits of being a famous fag. Not one female leftist, but two. It's the greatest sex I've ever had. You better make sure no one sees you. You gotta be more gay than Elton John, you hear me? Okay, Dede, I can't talk now, catch you later. Bye. You tell him you can do it no matter what he says. The amounts this guy is willing to pay, no way we're letting this go. What if he tells me to French kiss a man? Just go with it, man. I want to go home. -Don't worry, everything's OK. Hello. -Hi! Hilik, how are you? -Fine. Hi. -Hello. Hello. -Good morning. This is Paz. -Hi, Paz. -Nice to meet you. It's so great to meet fellow gays. Paz is obviously not a homo. -What... -A lesbian. I meant a lesbian. I hope you don't mind me calling you a lesbian. Define lesbian. Uh... a woman who... loves another woman. Define woman. I freed myself of restricting definitions that are no more than hollow social conventions. I totally agree. Okay, friends, shall we begin? Ami, we chose you because you convey simplicity, warmth, humility. You don't comply with the gay stereotype which is fantastic. Shattering stigmas is our goal. Wouldn't you agree? -Absolutely. I agree with every word. -Fantastic. We are going to embark on a thrilling journey of open encounters at cultural facilities in Jerusalem. Paz will be the facilitator, you'll accompany her, answer questions and tell people about your experiences as a gay man. Is that it? No... No nude photos? -No, no nude photos. I hope you're not disappointed. -No... -Nude photos... I'm on board. Whatever you say. So, he agreed, let's discuss numbers. Before we get to that, Paz has something to say. Yes, there must be clarity insofar as the LGBT community. So when you address your audience, I want you to explicitly mention the lesbians, the bi's and the trans. May God forgives me for using those definitions. You and your queer theories. You confused Ami here. -No, not at all, I understood every word. But I didn't get what you are. Are you a man? A woman? A homo or a lesbian? Nice one, Shushan, exactly. I'm all of those and none of those. Kudos. Kudos. Kudos. -She's... She's the man. Shiksa! Disgusting! Look who's talking? -Get the hell outta here! The hottest fashion in uptown Kishinev, winter 1900. I'm hungry. -Let's go. Hi. Tell me... Is Carousel around? -Who? Carmiel... Carousel... that singer of yours. Oh, you mean Cruella. -Cruella. But you can call her David if that's easier for you. David?! David Biton. He's not here, he's sick, sweetie. "Sweetie" your sister! And don't call her that anymore! -But that's his name. David. So? You gotta shout it out? You call her that again I'll rip you apart, you hear me? You son of... Son of... People, I said enough, I want you to remember, as geniuses who will one day be leaders of society, you must break down the generalities and accept the wide range of voices in society. Now I want you to talk to Ami. His is a sad story about lack of acceptance. Ami, go ahead. -Thank you. Hi, kids. I'm Ami Shushan, the premier league king of goals. I'm sure you know that not too long ago I had the courage to come out to players, fans and bad people who don't like gays and curse them out. I'm here to explain to you and to show you how a proud homo should behave. You with me? Good. Are there any homos, lesbians, bi or trans in the class? They're only 12 years old! Okay, I'll phrase that differently. Any Pink Hapoel fans? You're a Pink Hapoel fan? Great! What's your name? -Or. -Or. Let's say you just found out that Or is a homosexual, what would you say to him? -Nothing. He has his rights to his preferences and we would respect that. Exactly. -That's because you guys are geniuses, but let's say you were carpentry students? What would you say then? I'll tell you what you'd say, you'd say "Or the fag," "Or the pussy," "Or the pillow biter." -What?! Are you insane? I apologize. There must be a misunderstanding, they're overly sensitive. Shushan, wait outside! These things take time. My first game with the adults, I played like crap. No way I'm letting this slide. Everything that happened will be reported and we'll have a profound discussion as to the future. That's all. "Critically Queer by Judith Butler" Fine, no problem. You wanna snitch on me? Go right ahead. Hey, Nachi, how's it going? -Hey, Shushan. You know very well how it's going. 5 consecutive losses, they're gonna go down a league. Shushan, can't we arrange a sit down to get you back in the game? Both parties have to want a sit down. I don't think it'll happen any time soon. -Oh yeah? How can I help you? Why did you call? You know I'm doing a campaign for the gay community, right? -Sure. Today was the first encounter with a class of 12 year old geniuses, it sucked so bad. -Why? I can express myself on the field. Even post game interviews scare me. Why're you laughing? They wanna get rid of me. I thought before they do, maybe you could give me some tips. You look like a man of words and... you know... you're experienced. Experienced? -As gay. So, as a gay man with experience, I say you should talk about soccer. What's soccer got to do with this? Why do you think they chose you for this campaign? Because you're the straightest gay there is. You're a soccer player, you're a great guy, you break all the stereotypes about homosexuals, that's their purpose. That's what the guy said. Exactly. So you don't have to talk at all. And if you do want to talk, make it about what interests you. Bro... I knew you'd save me. Feel free to call any time... Bye. -Bye. -You know, you said I'm a great guy. You know what? You're a great guy. Really? No one's ever said that to me. -Take it from Shushan, you're a real man. Bye, Shushan. -Bye. Blackiel Blackiel Get me offl Blackiel I'll pay! - Enjoy, my friend. Enjoy the shower. You can't see anything. Now you can see. He'll damage the car. -Who cares? It's his car. I hope you waxed the car. -I polished it. The son of a bitch started a business and didn't tell us. Who? "Shushan's profitable project" -The mattress muncher, Shushan. We'll wait for him outside the building at Mamila. -Cool. Mirit, how are you, baby? -All good. Sammy and I have an errand to run. -Sure. You'll go home by taxi. Sammy, give her some money. I only have large bills. Okay? Get us some puff pastry for tonight. -Sure. Love ya. Bye, Mirit. -Bye. "Shushan's profitable project" Wait, wait. What's the rush? Tell me, you fuckers, you really think you can leave me out of the fun and games? What fun and games? -I made you fag. Thanks to me you're a famous queer, thanks to me you got that campaign and I want my 50 percent. 50 percent, Blackie? I only get 20. And I'm Blackie Bukovza. Who are you? I'm his agent, Dede Ben Shabat. His agent, my ass, who do you represent? Except Shushan and that lame singer who only does covers to the anthem? What's his name? -Uh... -Shawn "The songbird". I want to know when you get your first payment for the campaign. Huh? If I find out on my own it'll cost you another 10 percent. 2 weeks. - You wait 2 weeks. One week. Not one week. This Sunday, 8 pm, you come see me with 20 thousand, cash. Is that clear? What? -On Sunday I'm invited to my sister, it's the fast breaking festival. What fast breaking festival? You said you're a Christian. Half and half. Half and half? We'll talk about it later. You'll learn that messing with Blackie... Blackie... -Blackie... Shushan, what did he do? My poor baby. I'm warning you, this is your last chance. Fine, I heard you. Don't worry. I consulted with some friends from the community, I promise you it'll be fine. Honorable rabbi. People... I want to thank Rabbi Kaminer for his courage and open-mindedness to invite us here. -Sure thing. I know that this topic is controversial for you people so let's start with your questions. Yes. -Sir, may I ask Shushan a question? I'm not "Sir." -Ask away. How old were you when you discovered the disease? Silence! Behave yourselves! A disease? Homosexuality is not a disease. Of course it is. -Oh yeah? Do I look sick to you? But you were suspended from the league... Who told you that? It's a known fact. They feared you'd infect the players, that you'd harm their masculinity. -Really? How about we play a game outside and see whose masculinity's been harmed. How about it, Rabbi? Does Jewish law permit us to play with him, Rabbi? I permit you to play with him. Let's play soccer! That doesn't count! A penalty kick! Put it here. No, no, I'm afraid. I don't want a missile to my face. Anyone's a man enough to stand there? Is anyone man enough to stand there? Who's man enough? Shoot! Don't worry. - Give it your best shot or I'll kill you. Shoot! Former goalie for the Jerusalem Tigers. Piece of cake. We'll arrange a prayer to ask for absolution for you. Now you're talking. God wiling. -Bye, Shushan. -Bye, Shushan. Shushan! Shushan! Shushan! Shushan! You did good today. I told you not to judge me after just one game. What's up? -You okay? Yes. -Hey, Mirit. -Hi, Sammy. Are you going in? I'm finishing my cigarette. Oh yeah? -You go in, I'll be right there. Don't be too long. Sammy, come on. Sammy, order a Coke for me. Hey. -HeY- Is the coast clear? -Yes, he's inside. What are you doing here? Your sugar daddy... has new demands. -I know. He's been driving me crazy lately. Could it be that... that night... with Blackie... Did you kiss me or was I hallucinating? I don't know. Maybe. You can kiss me now and compare. Thanks, I got it. -Son of a bitch! Get over here, give me that. -Hey, hey. -Give me that! Hey, let go of me! You're assaulting the press! Let go of my hand! -Only if those pictures don't get out. This can't get out. -What? That you're straight? I'm not straight. Those definitions are no more than hollow social conventions. Cut the bullshit. The public has the right to know that you French kissed a woman. Define "woman." -Shushan. What're you doing here? -Nothing. I came to... give you the... -Cool, give it to Sammy. Awesome. Nice doing business... Go on, get outta here. You okay? -Where were you? I was looking for you inside. I had stuff to attend to. You okay? What are you doing? -What? What are you doing?! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! Why're you taking pictures?! Go home! Well then. Considering the dimensions of your chest and body, I think this size will be perfect for you. Doctor, are we here to enlarge or reduce? It must be proportional. What do you think, Mirit? Never mind what she thinks, I want you to enlarge. Mr. Bukovza, please... -Please, you too, Mr. Shiran. Enlarge. Are you screwing with me? That's the same size. Enlarge. Blackie, stop it. -What? It's the same size. I'm paying for this. We'll take it. It's 800 cc... I only implant this in transgenders. Cool, as far as you're concerned she's a transgender and you're implanting it in her. Kastel furniture, Coz, there are closets that are worth coming out of. Cut! Good job, Shushan! Let's do that again. Hello? -Are you screening my calls? -No, I'm in the middle of filming. When's the gay pride parade? On the 19th? How do I know? -Ask someone. -Hold on. Does anyone know when the gay pride parade is? The 19th. -The 19th. You were right. -Guess where I got a call from. Where? -From Paris. Marie from L'Equip magazine. You're one of their candidates for athlete of the year. Do you realize what this means? -You're kidding. -You think? They were thrilled by your coming out and your campaign. This never happened in soccer. You're a hero! What does it mean? They're sending a crew over to interview you during the campaign. She asked me when to come. I set it up for the day of the parade. I even remembered the date. -What's the parade got to do with it? Don't you get it, dumb ass? We're gonna give them a show they'll never forget. No one remembers the candidates. We gotta win. Winning means foreign interviews, merchandise, campaigns, everything we ever wanted. You hear what I'm saying? -Yes. The dream was to make it as a soccer player, not a fag. Don't be narrow minded. Catch you later, I got another call. What a fag. Hi, guys, how are you? -Couldn't be better. Let's make this snappy, we gotta make the semifinals. The Eurovision semifinals? Isn't that tomorrow? The Champions League semifinals, Chelsea versus Barcelona. Tomorrow... -Tomorrow. The Eurovision is tomorrow... Luckily they don't clash. -Luckily... What do you have planned for the parade? We're planning a short route, 2.5 kms. We'll gather at Independence Park, we'll march along Agron St. Until the speakers' platform at Bell Park. Forget the procession, what about the action? Where's the action? -There is no action. We want to maintain the delicate fabric between a respectable and respectful procession. So what, people taking a stroll? The parade and the visibility, that's what it's all about. The city can't contain any more than that. We'll have some balloons, some signs, maybe one or two drag queens to add some color. Sounds good. -What? What about Ami Shushan? Isn't he a leading talent here? We'd love for Ami to head the parade. He's more than welcome to get on stage in the park. Hold on, I have some suggestions, if you don't mind. First of all, I suggest you block off from here to Mamila, that way there will be room for the truck. -What truck? This truck. It has a stereo system that will rock the Wailing Wall. I'm sorry, we're not going to do... - Paz! I'll take questions when I'm done. Right after the truck, a float with the gays, after the float with the gays, a float with transvestites, after the transvestites, a float with... transgenders, bis, go go dancers, you name it. Then the one and only will perform, Shawn "The songbird". He'll get the crowd shakin' like you've never seen. And then, he says, "Ladies and Gentlemen, "l'm proud to present my best friend, "Ami Shushan!" Ami gets up there, confetti, excitement, the city goes wild. Ami hands out soccer balls especially designed for the event, there you go. He bounces the ball here and there, Shawn closes the event with his rendition of the anthem, then Ami gives his speech and sends the crowd home. Home, home. -Home. Mirit! Hi. Claire... From high school... 12th grade... Clara? Clara Knafo? -Claire. Claire Hannaf. I'm in shock! I didn't recognize you. -I've done it all, boobs, lips, eyelids... Check out my ear smoothing. What an improvement. -What else is left? -Butt. Brazilian butt. Are you happy? -Yes, I try to be... I think I am. Clara, forgive me, I didn't mean to upset you. Charm is deceptive, beauty is vain. Mirit Ben Harosh? Doctor Shiran is here. Are you alright? -Yes, I... I have to go to the bathroom. You still alive? Wasn't that beating enough? Don't worry, l'll recreate all the pictures I took. You'll never be that lucky again. -I don't know what you're talking about. Hi, Yigal, how are you? I saw the car and I ran away. That's awesome. What's up? -Where are you? -At the club, what's going on? Wait for me, I'm on my way. -No, no, no, the paparazzi's outside. But I need you. Hold on. Bro, is there a back entrance? -What do you think? Yes or no? -Yes. Good. I'll meet you at the back entrance. - Okay. -Bye. Jerusalem is on alert before tomorrow's gay pride parade. The gays and lesbians are already celebrating, the police anticipate disorderly conduct from the Orthodox community that is threatening to harm the marchers headed by soccer player Ami Shushan. The motherfucker... Can I go or do you still need me? -You can go. Make sure I can reach you. -Of course. Shushan, there's a room down here, you can talk as much as you want. Thanks, man. -You're welcome. -She's your family, it is my honor. Blackie will kill me. What do you mean you bailed? You know he won't like that. Of course I know. But I had this insight. I met this woman who went to school with me, Clara Knafo, we called her Clara the ugly witch. Poor thing. She had tons of plastic surgery just to become a babe and now she's even more miserable. You know why? -Why? Because her whole life's a lie. And her heart knows it. The heart can't be deceived. That's true, but you're nothing like her. I'm no better than her, Shushan. These are the days of drought My face dly like a crack in the soil My field withered, nothing left to harvest I whispered, lasked what for? Winter struck again cold as a sword The glaze in my eyes so cold and rainy Sadness stares from cracks in the walls lasked, I whispered until when? But when evening came With the evening wind A leaf falls on my rooftop I know I hear Someone always walks with me. With me? You may not have boobs, but you have balls. Where did you get the courage to put the freeze on him? Shushan, at one point you gotta stop Fight what's in your heart. He'll kill me. I'm a goner. You did the right thing. I wish I had the courage to stand up to him like that. You really think so? I'm so proud of you. I so needed to hear that. Wait. What was that? The paparazzi is such a leech.. Congratulations! -You're the best, Yana! Marina. Thanks, sweetie. You made it? -Of course. -Hold on. Thank you. What's up, Sammy? I saw Shushan and Mirit making out. No way. She's in the middle of surgery. I swear, she's here. -Where here? Uh... the Mommy club. -The Mommy club? You know... the... gay club. I don't believe it, that bitch. Listen to me, don't move, don't lose them, I'll be there in a minute. Where are they? I looked all over, they vanished right after we spoke. She got away from Felix and from you? Are you... I looked for them everywhere. One more time you and Felix screw me over, l'll butcher you. I want that motherfucker dead. You got that? Dead! Where does he live? Does he live up here? -Yes. -Let's pay him a visit. No, there's a guard in the lobby with closed circuit TV. This is not a good idea. You shouldn't have gone out in that dress. You look amazing. Look at yourself, you stunner. You're so hot! I have an idea. -What? He's marching tomorrow in the gay pride parade. We can whack him there. The gay pride parade with all the cops around? We'll dress up. -What? Those two will be at the parade for sure. Hi. -Good evening. Can we have a word? -Come here. Why? -A surprise. Only a few words. Come with me to the Lexus. The Lexus? Nice. What're you doing, you stinkin' homophobes? Shut your mouth, boy. -Do you have air-condition? What time is it? -I don't know. Oh no, the guys at the parade are waiting for me. I don't believe I have to go back to Blackie. Need some help? Hurry up already! -Hold on, the wig. Damn it! Nice. You can look now. You look amazing. -Not amazing, awesome. Amazing and awesome. All you need are tits like mine 800 CC and you're all set. We can go now, right? You're not going anywhere. -Excuse me? What's with the bad vibes? You could have told us you feel like being women, we would have done it gladly. -Exactly. After all, we're sisters. I can teach them my number from the show. -Do it. I'm diabetic. Fuckin' shit. I just saw death. "Proud of what we are" Jerusalem, Montefiore's propeller.. And David's Tower. What's up? You okay? -Dede, leave me alone. Smile, make some noise. -Leave me alone. Shikse, get the hell outta here. Look at the Israeli fans, hooligans, crazy, this is impossible... "They'll get to you, Shoshana, and kick your ass. "Shoshana, Shoshana, Shoshana "Get into my bed..." Help us! We were kidnapped! -Open the door. -Who is this? Who are you? Who brought you here? Two scary, ambivalent homos. With a gun this big, you wouldn't believe. Freedom! Love! Freedom! Love! Freedom! Love! Freedom! Love! Fuckin' shit. The cops, the cops. These heels are killing me. It's not easy, but I think I got the hang of it. Hello, ID cards please. Get outta my way, faggot. -Excuse me?! This oaf called me a faggot. Look who's talking. Who are you? We're... transvestites. He's the Snow Queen, I'm Scheher... Azade. -Who? Scheherazade, from 1001 nights. -1001 nights, huh? 91, this is 944, requesting urgent assistance. Hey man, we're transvestites... -Shut up. I've been securing this parade for 7 years and I've never seen any Arab transvestites. Come on. Scheherazade, let's go. He is half Christian. Ami, give a show of a lifetime. I'm going to the French woman, OK? Good Luck. What are they doing here? Relax, they're the good guys, they're here to do damage. That scoundrel is sitting backstage like some big celebrity. Hey, Fuchsie, what are you doing here? Who would've thought? That's the scoundrel's agent. Don't worry, we'll expose him too. What? An Arab can't be a transvestite? You racist. You took away all our rights, now you're taking away our right to be transvestites?! Look, we're a couple. Get the hell outta here. Go! You're a dead man, you son of a bitch. As long as deep within the heart A Jewish soul stirs And forward, to the East An eye looks out to Zion Our hope is not yet lost The hope of 2000 years To be a free people in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem To be a free people in our land The land of Zion and Jerusalem. Give it up for Shawn the Songbird! Brothers and sisters, gays, lesbians, bi's, trans, friends from outside the community, I'm proud to launch the main event of the gay pride parade. Give it to me... Couldn't you hand it to me?! The soccer player, Ami Shushan! Ami Shushan! Ami Shushan! Dear friends, gays, lesbians, bi and trans I'm proud to be here... I'm proud to be here... This speech means nothing. Forgive me, Dede. What I really want to say is that I, Ami Shushan, am not gay. -What? -What? I'm not gay! He's n0193Y! He's n0193Y! He's innocent! -He's innocent! He screwed my report! He stole my scoop! Please, let me explain. He's a innocent, innocent! I lied to you about being gay because I feared for my life. I'm not trying to make excuses. I can understand why you're angry. But there's one girl in this crowd that I love and she taught me that no matter what, you mustn't fight with your heart. Then I realized that you're the best example of that. All of you came out because you refused to resist your heart. You weren't prepared to lie. And to that I say, you have balls. All of you! Thank God, not anymore. My heart is in one place only, SOCCSF. The Jerusalem Sons. But I was a coward, I let evil people keep me away from my heart. But today, I decided that I'm like you. I, Ami Shushan, am no longer afraid. All I want is to get my heart back. I'm sorry, man. -That's okay. You're a jerk, but being straight suits you more. Shushan, wait. Bitch! Shushan! -You son of a bitch! Shiksa! Disgusting! The police continue their investigation into the murder attempt of Jerusalem Sons striker Ami Shushan by Blackie Bukovza and his partner Sammy Abu Salah. The police have evidence that the two major criminals lived double lives and are presumably lovers. Sammy... Whose idea was it to dress up? Where to? Where to? You'd think we're visiting the prime minister. Go in. Guys, you have visitors. Hello, girls. Do you recognize us? Don't be alarmed, we didn't come to settle scores. We're here to say we forgive you, what those Orthodox men did to you was awful. You paid a heavy price for everyone who marched yesterday. Sister, from now on you can count on the community. We even brought a little something to show our support. Hi... I'm David, remember me? I remember the way you looked at me at the club, it didn't go unnoticed. Here, call me from prison. Blackie, it's... He's a friend. Hey, Nechama. Missed us? The chocolate, mint and gum trio, don't start with me today. We're joking. Come sit with us. Really? -Who cares, as long as we'll stay in the league. With God's Help! -And with Shushan's help! Go Shushan! Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Added time here at Teddy stadium. The last chance for the Jerusalem Sons to score and remain in the league. Ami Shushan with the ball. He's trying to pass Gerti. But Gerti is kicking the ball out side for a corner kick. Shushan, you faggot! Former faggot... Shut up, you idiot! Go, Shushan! Jerusalem Sons' with a corner kick. Maybe the team's last chance. You're moving to a minor league, ha? You faggot, you queer. Jerusalem Sons 0 Hapoel Kiryat Shmona O This is unbelievable! A penalty kick from 11 meters! Shushan is down. Shushan is being taken off the field, he probably won't return to play. After the punch in his gut from the Kiryat Shmona player. What drama! All eyes are on Jerusalem Sons captain Liran Shimoni who will make the decisive kick. All his teammates are centerfield. And now Shimoni is about to kick the ball. What's this?! He's collapsing! It must be from all the pressure! What happened to Shimoni?! Shushan races onto the field. He's going to help Liran Shimoni. He's the one to kick. Yes! Yes! Jerusalem Sons! Mirit! Mirit! Shushan, we will do whatever you want. Shoshana! Shoshana! I wanted him to show I wanted him to show His love for me With a kiss I might have been mistaken I 'm sure I was mistaken When he smiled at me I felt it happen I want to live with him forever I'll surely take him as my husband We will live like husband and wife I want to live with him forever I'll surely take him as my husband We will live like husband and wife I asked if you're into me You said yes, just not here A friend brings a friend to the park I wanted him to say I hoped that he would say Come home with me Forever I want to live with him forever I'll surely take him as my husband We will live like husband and wife I want to live with him forever I'll surely take him as my husband We will live like husband and wife.
