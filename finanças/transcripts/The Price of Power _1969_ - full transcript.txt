The Price of Power You know where William Wheeler is, so talk. We haven't done a thing, not Wheeler or me! Not yet, that's true. But you might! Talk! Jack! The girl lives with him, says she knows where Wheeler's hiding. She doesn't know anything. - Where's Bill Wheeler? - She doesn't know. - Annie, get out of here. - I don't know. I only said it so I could see Jack. Then take a good look at him and pray he talks! Throw her out. That's a strange way to treat citizens for a representative of the law. - What do you want? - Jefferson, the Sheriff. It's pointless, I'll nevertell you! Go on, tell him. If you don't, I will. You'd betray your own son? No, but I'd ratherthey arrested him... because if anything happens to the President... Bill couldn't have a better alibi. If you know where he's hiding why didn't you tell my men? They talked funny. They don't look the sort to be walking around with a badge. I had to recruit volunteers to keep order. The President arrives tomorrow, don't you know? He might not make it. What do you mean? Someone wants to blow up the train when it's on the bridge. Someone? Who? People who want another civil war. Those two who came to me should know quite a lot about it. Put them in Jack's place, you might extract some very interesting information. Wheeler, if what you said is true... I assure you, you'll have done this country a great service. Wait. Do they really want to kill the President? Yes, that's why it's better if you and Bill are safe. With your history they might suspect you. No, why drag up the past again? Which one of you talked to old Wheeler? It was him. I thought he was one of us. He fought for the south, against his own son. Warn Wallace. He'll take care of this. I'll take Wheeler home so he doesn't talk to anyone. Wait for us to leave. He might see you. We'd better not mention this to anyone, if you haven't already? I haven't said a word. Leave Jack alone. Sure, don't worry. Put him in a cell and treat him well. You keep an eye on the negro. Damn it! You can die for all I care but Jefferson wants you alive! Why not send someone else if you're so worried'? No, I can't, dear. I must be there in person. I'm scared, I've heard many strange, alarming, things. Don't believe them, Lucrezia. It's going to be fine, don't worry. Mr. Arthur McDonald. I'll prepare the suitcases. Show him in. - Is everything ready? - Yes, Mr. President. But I received another report. According to the Secret Service the greatest danger is right in Texas. Your plans for reform have put everyone in the area against us. Starting with the State Governor himself. Yes, I know it's dangerous but it doesn't matter. That's precisely why I must go and speak to the people. That's important and it's all that matters. I want to speak to the people who work 14 hours a day. And I don't need any help from the people who exploit them. Mr. President, I agree completely but... I just don't think it's the right time to go to the south. What should I do? Turn and run'? You could think of an excuse. A political commitment. No, McDonald, I can't consider myself the President of the United States... if I can't visit the entire country freely. No, the presidential train leaves tonight as planned. Good day, McDonald. I'm aware of the situation but this isn't the time to be over-cautious. You're doing well for yourself. - You don't need me anymore. - Not that there was any need. Thanks all the same. What do you want from me, Wallace? We were passing by. So I thought why not pay my old friend Wheeler a visit. After all, we fought against the north together. - You should be pleased to see me. - The war's over, and we lost. The war isn't over. As long as there are damned northerners and southern traitors around. We all belong to the same country now. Forgive us, but we tookthe liberty of pouring ourselves a drink. There's some for you of course. To old times and the triumph of our beloved south. Too late. Foun There were four of them. They killed your father because he found out about the assassination plot. It's ridiculous, all my ideas have been distorted, they're unrecognisable. Don't get upset, you never read your speeches, you always say what you want. Improvise. All your enemies are in Dallas. You should avoid any delicate subjects. But that's why I'm going there. Mr. President, I was born and raised in the south... and they still think they're the heroes of the Alamo. They're bound to an ancient concept of virility and they discuss with pistols! I'm not going to Texas to discuss my ideas, just to clarify them. And no pistol can stop an idea. It looks like that negro who bust Slim's jaw. Then let's finish this, seeing as we're here. Why waste the lead. Jack! It's the same two who told your father about the bridge, I recognise them. I saw them with the Sheriff. There were four of you. Who are the others? Go, I can take care of myself. You have to get to the bridge. Ifthey wanted to stop us... it means Sheriff Jefferson's part of the conspiracy! Hurry, you've got to save the President or your father died in vain! I'll come back foryou. - Are we far from Dallas? - No, I don't think so. We'll be there in about an hour. Biggle, hurry up! The train arrives in seven minutes! I'll be finished in two! Keep your eyes open. I have to go back to the city. Hey, you! What happened? They wanted to dirty your shirt, Colonel. Watch what you say, kid! That's the President of the United States. I always know who I'm talking to. Unlike you. Just keep your eyes open. - What do you mean? - They wanted to blow up the bridge. Let him go, I think I've seen him before but I don't remember where. I'll help you. Perhaps my face reminds you of those fouryears you made me serve, Colonel. Four long years but all's forgiven. As you can see, I saved your life. But be careful. Not everyone around here thinks like me. The delay is worrying. You know how slow the trains are around here. A couple of hours late is quite normal. I've heard some alarming rumours. It's just talk, Vice President. There are a few troublemakers but the Sheriff's got it under control. - Welcome, lady. - Thank you. Thank you, they're beautiful. - Why was the train so late? - There was a small incident. - Are you the sheriff? - Yes. Well? The bridge was rigged with explosives. All those responsible must be arrested immediately. I'll do my best. Mr. Pinkerton, from the Texas Bank. - It's great to see you here. - The pleasure's mine. You see the flowers the Governor's wife gave him? Red roses! What's so strange? Around here it means blood. - Who are you? - It's Bill, let me in. Okay, I'll be right down. Help me, Jack's injured. No, I don't want him here. They're looking for him. - He escaped from jail. - But he didn't do anything. He needs a doctor. He's innocent. Guilty or innocent, what do I care? He's black, first they'll hang him then they'll see if he's guilty. Come in, quick. If anything happens to the President I'll hold you personally responsible. What's this? Our friend the Vice President, hope of the south... - is threatening his compatriots. - Careful, Pinkerton. All the gold in your bank won't save you from the noose. Besides the banks there's political power. He's the executive branch. In other words, Texas. You made a pact with Texas and Texas made you vice president. - Murder wasn't part of the deal. - Calm down. What happened at the bridge was an isolated incident. They all had stars on their chests. The truth might be the opposite to what it appears. We can speak freely. Explain yourself. Four men chosen by me to protect the President died on that bridge. Killed by a man who spent four years in jail for high treason. He presented himself as the President's saviour... but first he killed anyone who could give a different version of events. Then why haven't you arrested him? The President's convinced he owes him his life. It's true. I made it to vice president of the United States with your support. At the time I only saw mine and your interests. But two years of close contact with the President... have taught me to think about the future of our nation. It's in the people's interests that nothing happens. And it's in their interests that the whites are white and negroes, negroes! Tell your president we want to live our own way. Without interference from the government in Washington. You can also tell him we don't want him here... if he's come to turn our people against us. Your selfishness blinds you. There was a war for that and we lost. And now I'm glad we lost. Seems the climate in Washington has contaminated you. From now on I suggest you come and see us more often. We're here to talk about facts not ideas. If I may, I'd like to remind you of one, Mr. Vice President. You know we have in our hands documents that could destroy you. And you know they won'tjust destroy your person and your career but any chance of trust between the people and the Federal Government. I take note of your blackmail. Good evening. We're here to clarify where we stand. You can't leave without telling us what you intend to do. I intend to listen to my conscience. Do the same as well, if you still have one. He's in our hands, Governor, and he knows it. Let's allow him the pleasure of slamming the door. It's a bad wound but he'll be back on his feet soon. Interesting. When I work it's steady. But as soon as I stop it shakes. Maybe it depends on the bottle, it's empty. Fill n up. I'm dry, I can go to the saloon if you want? The best they've got. Don't move or you'll ruin the quilt. Listen, what way does the wind blow here in Dallas? It doesn't. This cigar doesn't light. Try this other one. You might even get your breath back. If you breathe in a mouthful you'll suffocate. Too strong? The cigar? No! It's the air that suffocates you. The air in Dallas is poisoned. So who poisoned it? I'll come back tomorrow. Your friend just needs to sleep. Why won't you tell me, Strips? - Are you scared as well? - Me? I've always been scared. Just one wrong move now is enough to send you to the morgue. Right. That's just what happened to my father. Talk to me. Who are you afraid of? Everyone, Bill. I've spent a lifetime pulling out bullets and mending broken bones. I never made a name for myself because... I disinfected myself with too much whisky Butl made it to my age keeping far away from trouble. Do the same as well. Leave! Why should I leave? Because there's a bridge still standing and no one here in Dallas... will ever forgive you for that bridge. Sheriff! - What is it, Cotton? - Bill brought his negro to me. He's injured. Keep him there. I can't explain now. You'll have instructions tomorrow. Do you want the entire city to see you? There's no one here! The President passes this way and I want to see him. He's still with the committee. He won't be leaving for a few hours. Come on, get back inside. Everyone around here's scared. No one's got the courage to stand up to them. We all wantjustice and equal rights. But we're waiting for someone to serve it to us on a plate. Anthony Ward, from the "Houston Tribune". Your development plan requires a notable financial effort. Could you tell us where you'll find the necessary funds? In the pockets of the rich. Higher taxes, less priviliges. But our representatives in congress are committed to not raising taxes. They'll try to keep their promises they made to their electorate... and I'll try to keep mine. You've been saying that for years! Need I remind you that only 2O percent of the citizens in Texas voted for you. The majority of Texans have never been able to express what they think. Only those who understand its importance can vote here. No reform will ever change the negroe's heads... or give intelligence to those only capable of picking cotton. There are those who see things as they are and say, why? I dream things that never were and say, why not? Politics isn't built on dreams. You say give the negroes the vote. It's a double-edged sword. You know our plantations rely on the negro workers. Our livelihoods depend on them. Ifthe negroes are so useful why not pay them fairly... and treat them with dignity and justice. The plantations will benefit as well. And production costs will increase. Then try settling for a smaller profit. You're trying to stir up the negroes... because you want to take them to the factories in the north. - That's why! - I'm not here to stir up anyone. I govern the United States of America, all of them! Of course. The heat of the debate. Any more questions, gentlemen? Have you seen the Sheriff's new helpers? I'm risking my neck keeping you here. Get away from there or I'll kill you! Careful, it's loaded! If it wasn't for this damned leg I wouldn't be here. I'd be out there shaking the President's hand. He's here, Mr. President. Thank you, McDonald. Can we shake hands? I remember who you are. You're William Wheeler. You were charged with treason by the military court. Yes, Mr. President. You asked for four years and the court gave them to me. There was also a negro on trial with you. And you were accused of provoking the extermination... of an entire company in the field. We were at war, and I should have sent you to the firing squad. But your service record was outstanding right up to that moment. What happened to you? I clearly remember you refused to defend yourself at the trial. Me and Jack Donovan were on guard duty. Our company was catching its breath before attacking an enemy camp The element of surprise was essential and the entire mission depended on it. All ofa sudden, a man appeared on top of a hill. Stop, Jack! But he saw us. He'll sound the alarm. They'll kill us all. And who was that southerner'? My father. It was a frightening war. It was, and it still is. My father was killed just two days ago. By the same people who wanted to blow up the bridge. That's why I was there. It's the only reason. Why do you think I came to Texas? To put a stop to all this. So that violence will finally give way to equality, justice. You saved my life. I hope you'll be glad you did one day. Yes, but for now there's only one thing that counts around here. - This. - It doesn't frighten anyone. - What is it for? - To silence anyone. Even a president. That's what they want to do, right? That's right. There are many others who share my beliefs. About that business on the bridge, I'm already glad. Thank you. You've seen the show, now come with us to the Sheriff. He wants to talkto you. Now. If Jefferson needs to talk to me... Tell him I'll be waiting here. You get the idea? These belong to you. Well? You wanted to talkto me. This time you've gone too far. Now I've got the proof to lock you up! Resisting arrest. It's the same star those men who wanted to blow up the bridge were wearing. And maybe the other ones who killed my father had the same badge! You might fool those from Washington... but when they leave you'll answerto me! Okay, but remember, they'd better make it back to Washington. Alive. Because if anything happens to the President, I'll kill you! This goes on the front page. Got it? Pinkerton's orders. What does the boss want now? "Hero or Killer?" "An ex-con like William Wheeler proclaims himself the President's saviour." "ln reality, the presumed hero would've had good reasons to want him dead." It's a rotten lie! Don't publish it, Pat. You know I don't have a choice. Pinkerton owns the newspaper. - But you're the editor. - Only if I do what Pinkerton wants. - That's a bad way to be a journalist. - But it's the only way in this city. The front page, Nick. Okay. I hope the day comes soon when no one will have to live in fear. He just came out! - Go and warn them. - Okay. UP there! Murderer! To the doctor! - Follow the carriage! - Stop! Your duty is to get to safety. Help me, do something! He'll be okay. Help! - What happened? - They shot him. Save him! - Is he alive? - Yes. You should have taken him to the hospital, they have better doctors. - I'm not up to it. - I know what you're worth, hurry! Bring him in. Slowly. Let go of me. I didn't kill him! I didn't kill the President! I swear, it wasn't me! Don't touch him! This man will have a fair trial. Let him pass! We're taking him to the jail. I'm innocent, it wasn't me! I brought doctor Hunter, he's the head physician at the hospital. I'll have to ask you to leave. Ask for a priest. You as well. You two were responsible for his safety. The killer's already been arrested. - Who is he? - He's a negro. Who? Jack Donovan. - You're covering for the real killers. - Calm down, we're all shaken up. Jack adored the President. Just like all the poorfolks like him. The rifle was still in his hands when they caught him... and the shots came from the house where he was hiding! Then, to stop him turning him in, he killed the man who putting him up. You work fast. It's easy to pin the blame on a negro. I'm telling you he fired from the window, I saw him with my own eyes. Impossible, the bullets that struck the President... almost certainly came from the walkway. Fine, we're all free to tell our own version at the trial. I did my duty. I warned you, Jefferson. I'll kill you. I will not stand for that arrogant tone against a valiant man like Jefferson. So you think it's all settled. One must never challenge the words of a valiant man. Gentlemen, the President is dead. Jack Donovan is innocent. I'll find the culprits. The real ones. I can't find the words to express my feelings, Mr. President. What do you mean? That for the past 19 minutes you're the new president of the United States. Not exactly, sir. It's 19 minutes that America doesn't have a president anymore. That would be the worst scenario. Fortunately, our country's constitution states that if the president were to die... the vice president automatically assumes his role. - Not until he's sworn in. - And only a judge can do that. He's waiting outside. I need to speak to you in private, come back later. - As you wish. - Judge Harvey, you can come in now. Where's the Bible? Repeat after me. Nick! What are you doing here? I'm looking for proof that confirms an idea of mine. I think the shots that killed the President came from here. Have you found something? This. Winchester 32. I only found one, but two shots were fired from here. - Are you sure? - Certain. I was in the middle of the street when it happened and I saw everything. - How many men do you think shot him? - At least two. One man couldn't fire that many rounds in such short time. Let's look for the other shell. Look out! - Don't shoot! - Keep him in your sights. Come here! Thank you for coming, I have something very serious to tell you. You'll be free to use my words however you believe best. You're the only one I trust. Before you say anymore, it's my duty to inform you... that the only president I feel bound by any loyalty is in a coffin. I'm in their hands. I always have been but it didn't matter before. Now they think they've achieved their goal. To control the President of the United States like a puppet. What are you saying? Who are you talking about? Pinkerton. Why did you swear'? You played their game. America needs a president. Isn't it worse being in their hands? Listen to me, it all depends on you. These two years with the President, I've learnt a lot of things... and I'm committed to pushing forward his reforms and ideas. To do it, certain documents in Pinkerton's possession must be destroyed. The scandal wouldn'tjust bring me down... but everything we've achieved at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. It's another reason why I took the oath, to buy time. And if you can't get those documents back? Congress will reconvene in ten days... and ammendments will be presented which will give these blackmailers... the keys to the country. Ifthose documents aren't in my hands in ten days in Washington... I won't have any way out. This. I'll have no other choice. And it will be chaos again. Civil War. I'll do everything I can, Mr. President. I know it's a great responsibility, butl know you're the best man. I came to say goodbye. I'm staying in Dallas. Why? To look for the truth. My 90d! I hope to see you again in Washington in ten days. Thank you. No matter what happens. Thank you. I built this place before I gave my legs to my country. Remember, Bill? My sacrifice was good for something. And yours, Slim? What good will it do? How long do you think you'll last? I know you're just a pawn. I've got nothing against you. Who sent you? Enough! Jefferson sent me. Take it out on him. We just followed his orders. First you killed the President, shooting him from the walkway. Then you wanted to kill Bill. I want the entire city to hear what you just said. Now let's pay Jefferson a visit. Don't move. Stay where you are. Turn around. Drop the belt, and don't try anything. You? You're with them as well? There are things in politics you'll never understand. I'll explain one day. Do as I say, drop it. I said drop it. You were great! Bastard traitor! Son of a bitch! Dirty politician! You were the President's friend, right? You're a Judas! Get up. Tell him to keep out of this. Where did you find this idiot? What are you waiting for? He's caused enough trouble. - What happened? - He let himself get caught. And he told him the entire plan. From startto finish. Bill tortured me. He wanted to hang me. He arrived just in time. Whose side are you on'? Don't ask pointless questions. And stop thinking we're all fools in Washington. I'm innocent. They're trying to make me say that I killed the President. It's a lie. It wasn't me. And I'll never say I did it. Never! Please, sir, try to get a message to my friend, Bill. I didn't shoot him. And he can prove it. Slim, you'd better disappearfor a while. You'll lead the escort. He won't make anymore mistakes. - Where are they taking that negro? - To Fort Worth, he'll be safer there. Front page, with the biggest letters you've got. Yes, Mr. Jefferson. Don't move! Read it, Pat. "Brilliant work by the Sheriff." "The President's killer has already been arrested." - "A negro by the name of..." - Tear it up. On the front page you're going to announce the death of Jefferson. Careful, Bill. lf you kill me they'll hang you. Or you'll have me shot from a walkway. - Slim lied to save himself. - But no one will save you. Because the score I have to settle also includes my father. He trusted you. - And you killed him. - No, it was Wallace. I didn't go inside, only Wallace. You can't kill me without giving me a... The only thing I'll give you... is a cigar. The pistol. Don't try anything. Nick, light the lamp. You close the window. Don't you know the game? One single bullet and just the flame from your cigar... to aim at. Nothing else. Blow it out. Stop! Don't do it! If you kill him you'll lose Jack. Where's Jack? On the road to Fort Worth or straight to Hell! I want you alive when I come here with Jack. I want him to watch you die! For now, sign the confession. Son of a bitch, traitor! Justice is sewed. Negro! I want to know whose side you're on'? I'm with the United States. - Explain yourself. - Jefferson signed a confession... - But it must disappear, give it to me. - Why did you release Slim? Because everyone has to believe it was the work of a madman. - You mean Jack Donovan? - Yes. Why are you trying to cover up for the President's killers? - To control them. - I don't understand. All I know is my father's dead, and now 50's Jack. Give me the confession. Look, this is the second time you've asked me for something pointing a gun at me. I said give it to me! You must be stupid if you think I carry that document around with me. Go on, shoot! Okay, I don't want to kill you to see if you're lying. But if you make it necessary, I won't hesistate for one second to shoot. Me neither! They killed you to save America. Happy, Jack'? Due to present adverse conditions and the emotional climate here in Dallas... The accused, Jack Donovan, was moved to a secure location for his own safety. I've been presented with an injunction on behalf of the Federal Court. They ask that the State of Texas provide sufficient motive... to incriminate Jack Donovan for the murder of the President. Mr. Arthur McDonald is here to represent the Federal Government... in this vicious attack against the state of Texas and its legal procedures. Now, unless new evidence comes to light during this debate... I will reject this humiliating injunction. You may begin, Mr. McDonald. I'd like to ask the Sheriff something. Who are those men with a star seated behind you? They're men I had to recruit to keep order during the President's visit. You could have spared yourself the effort given the results. And tell me, how did you choose them? I chose them based on their reputation as marksmen. Would that be the same reputation the men in V\lallace's gang enjoy? - That's a ridiculous insinuation. - Stick to the facts. Did you ever doubt which direction the shots came from that killed the President? No, I saw the negro shoot from the window myself. And you didn't doubt it even after many eye-witnesses... declared that the shots came from the walkway? If, as you say, the shots came from the walkway... they would have hit the President in the front... but doctor Hunter confirmed the entry wounds were at the back of the skull. Yes, that's what doctor Hunter says in his report. But that report isn't the only one that should have been presented. Doctor Strips' report is missing. Why wasn't he also asked for a written report? V\lasn't he the first person to examine the President? Doctor Hunter is far more qualified than that old drunk. Thank you. Doctor Strips. You were the first to examine the President's wounds, is that right? Yes, the entry wounds were in the throat. When they brought him to me the President was at death's door... and no one can say they saw wounds at the back of the skull. Not even doctor Hunter. Thank you, doctor Strips. I'll call you back if necessary. Will you call doctor Hunterto the stand. Doctor Hunter, did you personally examine the President's wounds? No. One more question, sir. Did you sign this sworn statement... that the bullets entered the back of the President's skull? Yes or no? Yes. You may stand down. Your Honour, given this new evidence... I ask this court to retract the accusation against Jack Donovan. I ask that Annie Godard take the stand. You made a sworn statement in which you claim Jack Donovan... had confided in you that he wanted to kill our President. Do you confirm your declaration? Well, do you confirm this declaration or not? - Yes, I confirm it. - Thank you, Ms. Godard. That's a beautiful dress. Did you buy it recently? That's my business. Business is flourishing after Jack's arrest. How come? I'm still young and I'm not exactly ugly. - I don't think it's hard to see... - You mean you're a hussy? That's an offense to the witness' honour. Stick to the facts. What exactly are you suggesting? I merely wish to prove that this witness's statement is false. Because she's been paid. Do you have proof? I assure you within 24 hours I'll have a list of everyone who paid her. Silence! Yes, it's Jack Donovan! I see you respect him more dead than alive. Because he's on your conscience. What's the meaning of this? It means you can stop this charade. That's my friend, Jack Donovan. He loved the President. Because he told him blacks and whites are the same. They accused him of killing him, but it isn't true! The President was killed by people who didn't think like him. The truth is written in here. Stop! That's what a traitor to the south looks like. He fought with the north against his own father. You're nobody, Wallace. You're just a dumb killer. You'll P33'! Disarm him and take him to the abandoned village. We'll continue this conversation later. At last. Welcome. I wasn't expecting such a warm welcome. First of all, allow me to express our admiration... for the ability you demonstrated this morning. Champagne. A luxury worthy of a great event. But I prefer toasting the satisfactory conclusion of our current business. I see you'd prefer to get straight to the point. I'll try to make this brief. You've proven that negro's innocence. Sheriff Jefferson's inability to hold such an important role. You also revealed that Jefferson was working with Wallace... and that they're the real culprits. You've done very well. Let's forget the pointless compliments. I'm here to listen to solid proposals, nothing more. Let's stop beating around the bush... and get straight to the point. We just want to defend the prestige of Texas and this city. We want this matter closed. After all this uproar... we'd really appreciate the silence. I understand, but silence is golden. And we're prepared to buy it. Name your price and we won't challenge it. I have proof Jefferson and Wallace acted on your direct orders... and I know you possess documents which you'll use to blackmail the president. Lastly, I have proof... that you assassinated the President of the United States for this very reason. Yo ul r e Crazy. I know very well you're also in Pinkerton's hands... but that's a problem for the state of Texas, not the government. - Don't you think you've gone too far? - You know perfectly well I've haven't. Before stepping into the lion's den... I gave the proof to three people in whom I have the greatest trust. And if I'm not with them in 24 hours... you'll start feeling the noose around your neck. - We don't wany any more violence. - Good. You can avoid it by simply giving me those documents... with which you intended to blackmail the new president. I'll make sure Jefferson and Wallace take the fall for everyone... and your person remains out of this dirty business. The investigation will be closed forever. In some cases violence really is indispensable. - I'll give you twenty four hours. - It's you who has twenty four hours. Twenty four hours to deliver me that proof or you're a dead man! Great. - What are you going to do? - Look for Bill, he's very late. Somethings happened. I'll take the carriage. Print twice as many, three times, even. They'll fly out. Be seeing you. I've robbed banks, attacked trains... but you need a lot of money to build an army! But the day will come when I fight in the field against the Yankees. And when it comes the entire south will fight with me! Right, Jefferson? I was expecting to find an outlaw but you're also crazy. Pinkerton and his men used you to get what they want. Now they've left you out to dry. They'll hang you. Without honour or glory. You don't get it. They work for me! You'll find out soon enough. They betrayed us. Look. "Jefferson and Wallace, the men who really killed the President." - ls it already on sale? - Yes. Then everyone's read it. They'll round up a group of volunteers to get us. Everyone saddle up. You'll see who the lunatic is when I come back, me or Pinkerton? You're not coming back, Wallace! Stay here and keep Brett and Mortimer company To Dallas! Forthe last time, I'm offering you wealth, enormous wealth! There's enough gold in each one of those safes to buy Texas! The documents, Pinkerton. Just the documents. You've no other choice. - We'll see. - I want to have some fun. You taught me a great game. I'll teach you another one. Always with one bullet. You like it? But he's lucky! Look, look. Jefferson, look who's here. Hi, Nick, are you here to free you friend? Or are you looking for charity? Why don't you try the church? We're too kindhearted. Go ahead and laugh. They need jolly people like you in Hell. Stop! You lost at your own game. You know the game. Blow it out. He shot you! It burns, the bullet's inside. Help me. Pull it tight. - Who is it? - It's me! Are you crazy? Get in! - Not him! - What's wrong? What happened? I've never seen you scared like this! - They're terrified. - Why? They're killing all the witnesses. They started with Annie, the negro. They've taken McDonald and I don't know if he's still alive. And Wallace is outside with his men. I heard them shooting. And Strips? He testified as well. Wait! You can't do this alone. Think for a moment! Pat, what's happening is horrible... but it's been going on for a long time. Why are you so scared now? You! They forced me to. Don't you understand? They made you sheriff to get what they want. Unfortunately We need money. - How much have you got? - Last week's takings. Cut those piece of paper in the shape of banknotes. I'll explain later. I've got to find Strips. Come. Strips! Old Sponge! Who was it? Even ifl told you it wouldn't do any good. I'll go find a doctor. No, I know how to die. Who was it? Tell me! I was careless at the trial. Pass me my bag. I'm the best at this kind of thing. There, by the mirror. Thank you... for having faith in me right up to the end. - What end? - Mine, kid. Mine. Trust the diagnosis of an expert. Listen, you know the law. I can't save you from jail but I can spare you the noose. Now untie me. - I'll face Wallace. - You're a coward, you betrayed me. I want those documents right now! So I won't need you anymore. - You wouldn't know what do with them. - Why? Do you think you're smarter? Yes, a thousand times more. I know the new President but you don't! I don't give a damn about your schemes! Ifl want those documents it's only to prove to everyone... what the people in Washington are really like. So I'll start the war again! - Where are you going? - Pat sent me, the Sheriff. I have to deposit the money from Washington in the bank. What money? The $20,000 bounty for the President's killer. - Put it down and scram. - But it's the state's money. I said put it down. It's real. It's full of dynamite! Move it, I haven't got time to waste. Give me those documents right now or I'll kill you like a dog! Okay, Wallace. You can have them. It's a pity, we could have risen again... without a wild lunatic like you. Go to Hell. Come out! Where are you, Wallace? I'll kill you! But not how you killed my father! Show yourself! Coward! Go on, shoot! Four. Five. Give me those documents. I didn't risk my life to leave them with you. That wouldn't be right. It's time people know the truth. Some truths are best left unspoken. These documents are more useful to me than you... and I want the same thing you do. Our President's dead because he wanted peace and I'll use them for peace. - Why should I give them to you? - I'll give you two good reasons. First, because I've got a gun. Second, because if you don't, I'll kill you. There's a train tomorrow morning. Take my advice. Take it. Not yet, wait. Go ahead and load them. I thought about it. You need them more than me. All I need is my gun.
