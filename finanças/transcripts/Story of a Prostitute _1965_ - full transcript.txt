Harumi is one in Tianjin. There she fell in love with a Japanese man. She loved him with all her heart and hoped to marry him someday. But the man she loved brought a bride back from Japan. Tomoda is my man! If you don't go back to Japan right now, I'll kill you! Tomoda isn't here. He's out. I know how you feel, so I came to apologize to you. Look, Harumi. You're the only one I really love. My getting married doesn't mean a thing. The relationship between you and me hasn't changed. Leave that woman... or I'll kill you. Hey, mister. When will we get there? It makes me feel scared. Since we left Tianjin, all we've seen is nothing. That's all. Four billion people wait for us in China. When do they start business? - Tonight, they said. - I see. I'll get a special pass and be the first one to have a go. She already said okay. Hey, sis, how about me? No, you're after me. I don't care. As long as I get my turn. Disgusting. Those mountain soldiers are like beasts. They're just hungry for women. This isn't Tianjin, you know. How many women you got there? You three make seven. Kiminoya has six. All together, 13. Just 13 to take care of a whole battalion? They look strong. The men in Tianjin can't compete with these soldiers. I want to throw my body against lots of different men. Nakahira! Ohashi! What are you going to do? I can't stand this dangerous place. I've only got one life. Are you gonna walk all the way back to Tianjin? It's better than dying. Harumi, let's go. I'm not going. I've got no other place to live. Damn! Isn't that the village of Airoson? Yes, sir. We've got to kill some men and set an example. Look how they act like nothing's happened. "If road damage, wire damage or minefields are not reported immediately, the responsible parties will be severely punished." Good thing you weren't hurt. The soldiers in Buken wouldn't be happy if anything happened to you. Which company do you belong to? - Battalion headquarters, sir. - Going to general headquarters? No. I was just released from the hospital in Peking, sir. You were in the hospital? You look pale. Where were you hurt? The left thigh. I got it in the bone, sir. - In which battle? - The Joshachin attack, sir. You must have been slow. In another hour, we'll say good-bye to you girls. SUNRISE PALACE Most of the soldiers come here when they're off duty. Almost the entire battalion will come. An entire battalion. A thousand men. So that means I get a hundred. I wonder if I can handle them all. Look at us. We're still alive. You'll find one you like, too. How do you find time for that? It's all in how you look at it. We don't take it all so seriously. It's the only way to handle it. That was Takako, and the other two were Midori and Tsuyuko. This place is like a washing place for the soldiers. When the dirty stuff piles up, they come here to wash their minds and bodies. When they leave here, they're as good as new. And where do we do our washing? Yuriko is crazy about washing. It's the only time she's happy. You mean real washing? There's a river back there. Plenty of water. New girls? Definitely Tianjin girls, all right. Pretty good-Iooking. Sergeant, please. He's in charge of the Kempei troop. He helps us a lot. Be nice to him. How do you do? Hey, are you from northern Japan? I'm from Miyagi Prefecture. - Where is that? - The village of Kurigoma. Kurigoma. I'm from Ichinoseki. Really? They're right next to each other. We must get together and talk. Yes, let's do that. Yuriko, you're lucky. Rest today. Tomorrow you start working. What time do we start? From 1:00 to 4:00 p.m., soldiers. From 5:00 to 8:00 p.m., noncoms. From 8:00 p.m. on, officers. And Kempei Sergeant Akiyama is treated as an officer, understand? Master, I'll start right now. Who is it? I've got a customer in here. Never mind that! Open up! What's all this about? Stop that! You'll break the door! Who the devil are you? Open up, you idiot! Who are you calling an idiot? - Don't get mad. - Shut up and go away! Are you the new one called Harumi? I'm here for some fun. - No. I've got a customer in here. - Who is it? Hey, get up! Oh, it's you. Adjutant. You've had enough. It's my turn. I'm leaving with the detachment tomorrow, sir. I don't know when I can get a pass again, sir. I'll call you back soon. Get out. You don't have to go. What could you want with an "idiot" like me? And I don't want you either. Don't go! Idiot? A whore mustn't talk like that. Don't you call me a whore! Would the emperor use words like that? They always say that officers repeat the emperor's words. How dare your filthy mouth speak the emperor's name! - I'm leaving, sir. - All right. You bastard! Good morning. What's that? Look at the sun. It's right above your head. Is Harumi still sleeping? How can she sleep like that? Just looking at a bed makes me sick. Our bodies are all we have. We can't afford to ruin them. They've already been ruined. Coming to northern China and selling our bodies. Sakae, take that off. Take it off! The adjutant came to Harumi's place last night, you know. He was drunk, as usual. He chased Sergeant Kuramochi out. Is this adjutant that important? He's so brutal, always abusing his power. He treats the soldiers like animals and treats us like dogs in the street. He's more vulgar than the privates. But you like it every time he comes. You're crazy. I hate to admit it, but every time he touches me, I go out of my mind. What? Is it time already? Dismissed! Hey, I'm going to Kiminoya. Thank you very much. How do you do? Hey, get me a cigarette. Yes. The adjutant is coming tonight. Don't take any other customers. I'm not the adjutant's girl. Tell him not to order me around. Whether I take customers is my own business. Are you the adjutant's orderly? Do you think I'm filthy? I said do you think I'm filthy? You are not filthy, ma'am. That bootlicker looked at me as if I were filthy. Since I joined the military, you're the first to ever express your hatred towards me. But when I take you in my arms, you turn affectionate. You're a strange woman. I hate myself for it. There's a soldier who's like that. He hates me but obeys me like a dog, because he's been taught a military man must obey in everything. Look at my orderly... - Mikami. He's a perfectly tamed dog. He'll do anything I tell him to do. He's the model soldier. You'd better not offend me either. I have the absolute power of the military. You have no idea what that is, so just follow me around, wagging your tail. Idiot! What do you think a sword is? I'm sorry, sir. Those clear eyes. Damn. If I could make him go against the adjutant. Just watch. I'll tear your power to shreds. What's the matter? You're bleeding. It's nothing. Stop being the perfect soldier. If you do, you'll always be his orderly. It's stupid to die in this war. The brigade staff officer is coming. The CO wants to see you, sir. Hey, you. How come you always look at me as if I were filthy or something? Am I that dirty? If I am, what's it to you? I hate your eyes. What do you think I am? Soldiers wag their tails and come to me. Even that adjutant. If I weren't good, he wouldn't come to me. Tell me: What am I? What am I? A dog? A pig? Say I'm a pig... - I don't care. I'll act like a pig! What are you doing? Get away from me! Don't mock me! Don't mock me! What's this? Hitting a woman? Beating a woman... - is that what a man does? You lecher. You want to be Harumi's lover? She has the adjutant. You don't stand a chance! It's not true! Count off! One is on guard duty, and one is on KP. Salute! Eyes left! Salute! Salute! I'll explain the plan. As Colonel Shibata said, the Hachiro army is becoming very active in this area. In this region especially, guerilla activities are increasing. To put a stop to this, we've decided to send a detachment. How many men? Two squads. Just two squads can't do much in an emergency. Excuse me, sir, but our purpose is to determine whether the Hachiro army is there. Two squads are sufficient for that. You're drunk. The adjutant will be here all night. What's the matter? I have a headache. You'd better rest. Listen to me: You should rest. You'd better lie down for a while. You coldhearted man! You're shivering. You've never had a woman before. Forget about the adjutant. No. How could I do something like this? It's all right. You've shown me true happiness. I love you. When you hit me and I saw the anger in your eyes, I realized I was in love with you. I truly love you. What are you doing here so early in the morning? He comes for the adjutant at first call. I see. A hard worker. Don't tell the adjutant you saw me here. See you later. What's wrong? Why aren't you going? You'll make him suspicious. Sergeant, when are the new men coming? New men? Oh, you're in your second year here. Yes, but if new men don't come, I'll remain at the lowest rank. Be patient. Our country is having a hard time now. The entire nation is fighting. They're saying, "We want nothing but victory." Remember, officers are not fighting the war. We are. Unless the noncoms and soldiers are strong, we can't win. Welcome back. Hey, probationary officer, welcome back. How about a drink? No, thanks. Uno, won't you drink with me? I'll drink with you, but not today. DIDEROT'S PHILOSOPHIC THOUGHTS You don't have to do that. Uno, do it yourself. Philosophy. Isn't that a communist book? No, it's not. Don't try to fool me or you'll be in trouble. You were an officer once, but now you're only a private. Understand? Yes. You were demoted for anti-military ideas. You should have been court-martialed, but the commander helped you out. Sergeant... I was not afraid to be court-martialed. The commander was just saving his own reputation. You needn't feel sorry for me either. Just court-martial me. What are you saying? I've been ordered to keep a close eye on you. Remember that your life is in my hands. Where are you going? If the patrol finds you here, you'll go to prison. That's right. You're a strange man. Let me read. This is the only place I can relax. You know, Uno, I think I'll go to the detachments. In the detachments, they'll pay me the same amount that a Japanese woman gets. I wish they gave me the same amount here. I know it's dangerous, but my debts are growing. Are you leaving? - Yes. Wait a minute. It's all clear. You're the only one who pays me the same amount as a Japanese woman. Thank you very much. - Is the adjutant up? - I tried to wake him, but it's no use. Try again, please. I must show him that telegram now. Now or later, it doesn't matter. Hold me. But you were with the adjutant just now. So what? The reason I take him is because I want to see you. Hold me. But when I think of the adjutant... I told you to forget about him. What's the adjutant? He can drop dead. Aren't you jealous? Don't you hate him? He's a high-ranking officer. No matter what he does... I feel nothing. So you feel nothing, no matter what I do with him? Don't you feel anything? No. I can't help it. Reporting for service, sir! Coward! You're a coward! Why don't you hate him, despise him, kill him? Are you a man? I don't understand. I only know your body. I can't understand what's in your mind. Mikami! Don't go, please! Mikami! Fool! Why didn't you wake me? An orderly has his duty! Our detachment was attacked! Please send this to my father. I don't want the military to inspect it. Going on another punitive expedition? I'm leaving with the advance squad. The main force leaves tomorrow. It's quiet. It might be a trap. Shall we wait for a while and see? We don't have time. Let's go. Mikami. Sergeant Major Kuramochi! All ammunition and weapons are gone. Damn! They attacked at 2200 hours last night. The battle lasted two hours. The inhabitants were evacuated before the battle started. At least they died in battle. If the Hachiro army captures you alive, they'll torture you to death. Salute Sergeant Major Kuramochi and his 26 soldiers! You informed on them! I'll teach you a lesson! A deserter! Go over there! Sergeant! Sergeant! Harumi, which side do you take? I see you're all here. A present for you. We can't take men all day long, you know! What are you talking about so seriously? Marriage? Sachiko is... - Has anyone looked inside Sachiko's suitcase? No. Guess what's inside. Spoons, a knife, a cutting board and some cups. So she's been planning this. That's right. Wonderful. So she finally decided? If she needs money, let's all put some up. Here. How I envy her. Thank you, but a Kempei is an unpopular role. I honestly think you're lucky to be a Kempei. Why is that? Because you don't have to go on punitive expeditions. When are they coming back? You must be worried about Corporal Mikami. What? You know about that? If I can't find out who loves whom among 12 or 13 girls, I can't be a Kempei. Muraki, I wonder if he's safe. My lovers all die in battle. When are they coming back? You see, no one marries a pioneer's son. My son's getting old now. At his age, if he can't find a wife, I feel sorry for him. I heard someone else married a girl from this kind of place. It's all right if you pay her debts, but will Sachiko make a good wife? Master, the soldiers are coming back! The master will never understand how much we want to get married. Muraki! Muraki, where are you? - Muraki is dead. - Idiot! I'm still alive. Harumi, I'll hold you tonight. Wait for me. Now we can drink all we want. I really miss white sake. Harumi, you look excited. I'll see you later. Letting Uno desert in spite of your order was strictly my fault. Uno is dead. On the road or killed by the Hachiro army. Don't worry. Private Uno died in battle. That will do. "To the country which doesn't allow ideals, farewell." If it takes you too long To make yourself pretty Your guests will grow impatient Jealous? Too bad. He's a captain. Don't be stupid. I know I can't please you like Harumi, but please let me try. You coldhearted man! I went to meet you, but you wouldn't even look at me. Do you realize how I worried about you? Stop it! One more word and I'll never come to your place. Harumi! Where did Harumi go? Reporting for service, sir! - Bring me some water. - Yes, sir. I may be tough, but tonight I'm really exhausted. Mikami, remember this: Women get really hot if you keep them waiting. Here's your water, sir. Go get some sleep. Keep in step! Squad, halt! Sentry relief. Situation normal. Hey! She's not here! Hmm... She was drunk and felt sick. What's so funny? It's the first time you've acted brave. You know, at first I took you just to spite the adjutant. I wanted to ruin you. But now I'm the one who's ruined. I don't want to let you go! Halt! What's your unit? Speak up! Harumi, I heard Mikami is in the guardhouse at the west gate. Guardhouse? For five days. Akiyama told me. Thank you. If it was anything else, we could ask the adjutant for help. Mikami. Are you all right? I'm the guard now. You can see her all you want. What did you say to Mikami with these lips? How many times did you kiss? How many times did you sleep with Mikami? Three times? Five? Who is it? It's Sasaki. Forgive me. Adjutant. Enemy attack, sir. How many are there? I don't know, sir. They're attacking the west gate, sir. Is the commander up? Yes. He's in the command room, sir. I see. I'll be right there. Very well, sir. I wonder if Mikami is safe. Idiot! You're a slut! Mikami! What are you doing? Take all valuables and evacuate the camp! Mikami, get out! Die as an honorable imperial soldier. Where are you going? Harumi! Where is Mikami? They took him out a while ago. He's not in the guardhouse anymore? We need a machine gunner. Mikami is an excellent gunner. Harumi, he might die tonight. Harumi, don't go! It's dangerous! Who's that? Drop to the ground! Get up! Come on! Do you know Mikami? - Corporal Mikami of headquarters. - I don't know him. Hey, wait! Mikami! - Do you know Mikami? - No. Harumi! Where's Mikami? He's wounded. He might die. Where is he? In the trench, a mile out. We were surrounded. We could only get the machine gun out. Stop! Idiot! Mikami! Mikami... you're dying. At last we're all alone. You're mine... and I'm all yours. I'm with the Hachiro army political division. Does it hurt? We don't hate Japanese soldiers. You have rights under international law. I know the Japanese military forbids you to become a prisoner. But if we send you back, you'll be court-martialed and executed. I think you'll be safer staying here. Of course, you must cooperate with us. All right? Let's do as they say. I know how you feel, but we have no choice. I thought it would be the first time we could be alone. I felt very calm. You know what I thought about? About a festival day, and about the shrine my mother took me to, and the plum blossoms there. For the first time in years, I felt calm. In here I think I can hold on to that feeling. Don't talk nonsense! A court-martial will sentence you to death. I don't like that... - death. I won't let you die no matter what. I won't let you die. Harumi, stop singing that song. I said stop it! Stop it! Mikami! God, please help Mikami. Mikami! Mikami, don't throw your life away. There's no shame in being a prisoner. Are you still Japanese? Mikami! Just think. What are you trying to accomplish in China? Have you done any good? China will govern itself. Live with the Chinese for a while. It's a good experience. The Japanese are attacking again, so we're evacuating. Come with us and recover your strength. You'll be killed by your own people if you go back. You swear your loyalty and that's how they repay you? Come. We'll go together. I won't! You don't understand. I'm a Japanese soldier. I don't trust the words of a traitor. Let's go with Uno. If we stay here, we'll die. Fool! Japanese soldiers would sooner die than be taken prisoner. Uno! Wait! He's leaving. He's leaving. What will we do now? Everybody's leaving! They're leaving! Everybody's leaving! Let's go! Mikami! Wait! They're leaving! Mikami! Wait! Wait! We finally made it. Harumi, go back to your house. - No, I won't. - Go back! - Wait! - Stop! You'll make things difficult for Mikami. Do as they say. If they court-martial him, is it true he'll be shot? I think so. Poor man. Don't worry. They won't. They're afraid they'll lose face. Why did they only bring back the machine gun... and leave him there? Because the machine gun is property of the emperor. Yuriko, how did it go? He's been taken to Kempei headquarters. Akiyama told me he'll be sent to Daigen the day after tomorrow. Daigen? For a court-martial? That's right. And you didn't do anything? You couldn't help Mikami? That's terrible! Don't take it out on me! I went there to ask about him, didn't I? We should have gone with them. It's Sachiko! Sachiko! What happened, Sachiko? His son was a madman. There's no hope for a decent marriage! Harumi, you can take the day off. No, I don't want to. You're tired. You should rest. I want to be exhausted! If I'm tired out, I won't have to think. Harumi, is it all right now? Come in. How dare you make a fool of me? Mikami was wounded and taken prisoner while he was unconscious. If he hadn't been unconscious, he might have fought to the death. After he was captured, he tried to escape and to commit suicide. It's all true. So please don't court-martial him. Please, I beg you. Please. Are you crying for him? He's not a true Japanese soldier. He deserves to die. Harumi, bring me sake. A man of honor is strong. Remember the country's honor. Do your best not to disgrace it. Never allow yourself to be taken prisoner alive. Never sully the reputation you'll leave behind after death. Never let wine or women distract your thoughts from battle. That Mikami came back to die. That's right. Being captured is bad enough, and with a girl, too. The idiot. Sergeant! He's worse than an idiot. One or two missing can be forgotten. But by coming back, he's forced us to court-martial him. Because of him, the battalion's name has been stained forever! It will haunt us everywhere we go, as long as this battalion exists, Die before you come back. Understand? Yes. Attention! He was taught never to be a prisoner, so he came back to die. You see, this is from Harumi, so please... - I know. Really. Poor, poor, Harumi. Mikami, you have a visitor. I'll overlook kissing, but nothing more. Mikami. I'm sorry. Did a medic examine you? He wouldn't do it. That's ridiculous! What will happen to me? Will I be court-martialed? When? Tell me when. Tomorrow. Tomorrow? What time? Don't worry. Tell them the truth. You were taken away while unconscious. It's useless. If they don't believe you, I'll get you out of here. I won't let you die. Harumi, do me a favor. Tell me. I'll do anything for you. Get me a hand grenade. A hand grenade? What for? To escape. Escape? If they court-martial me, that will be the end. I don't want to be executed as a criminal, so I'll escape. I need a hand grenade to do that. There are lots of grenades in the offices. Please steal one of them. You'll live! You've decided to live! Do it before the truck leaves here. Hey, where are you going? To meet the adjutant. All right? All right. What do you want? Wait outside. To avoid staining the battalion's honor, what should we do with Mikami? Once we send him to Daigen, we can't do anything. What do you think? Kimura, you take care of him. Our commander is very troubled. Then Mikami will die an honorable death in battle? Right. He will die an honorable death. Salute! Tell me... what time will you send Mikami to Daigen tomorrow? Tomorrow? Harumi. Forward, march! Squad, halt! Corporal Shinichi Mikami, to be transferred to Daigen. Mikami! Mikami, get out. A court-martial will dishonor you. Your parents won't like it either. Are you ready to die an honorable death for your country? Understand? Dying here will make everything all right. Turn around! I said turn around! Enemy attack! That's the signal for us to get back! Shoot him! Shoot him! You idiots! You shoot him! Give me that! Take care of him. Out of my way! There's a hand grenade in my robe. Quick! The south gate, quick! Soldier, to the north gate! Harumi, go back! It's dangerous here. Aren't you going to escape? I can't do it. I'll show them I'm not a coward. I'll show them! Don't die! Mikami, you fool! Don't die! No, don't die! Don't die! Get away! I'll die with you! Long live the emperor! Long live the emperor! Never let wine or women distract your thoughts from battle, nor lose your mind and ruin the imperial army's dignity. Never bring disgrace to the military. Discipline yourself and live up to a warrior's honor. Control your anger and suppress your dissatisfaction. Consider anger the enemy. Do you understand why you've recited the field service code? A man from this battalion lost his mind over a woman. When the enemy attacked, he was taken prisoner, and when he came back, he committed suicide with the woman. What did he think of the divine military code? He was a stupid idiot. An ungrateful traitor. He was a brave soldier. Harumi had a great figure. It's a pity to lose her. I gather the one called Harumi was quite a woman. She drifted all this way into China. Just a professional prostitute. I see. Corporal Mikami died of pneumonia. The battalion attack plan. The enemy has moved south. We should keep the soldiers' morale up and allow them to follow in pursuit. Narita... China is a vast country. All right. Commence the attack plan at 1600 hours tomorrow. Mikami and Harumi could have both run away if they'd wanted. The Japanese are in such a hurry to die. No matter how hard it is, we must go on living. To live is the difficult task. It's dying that's cowardly.
