[Music] - The question is wether or not this is a covalent bond or an ionic bond. Who can tell me the answer to that question ? Well, Lee perhaps you want to share something like the answer to the question. - Oh, sorry. Could you repeat it ? - That's okay. I was just checking to see if you were paying attention. Clearly not. Please, return your equipment [Music] - Liam, right ? - Yeah. - That's what is up. I'm Waleed. Did you happen to catch what the professor was saying about the research assignment do tonight ? - I mean I did, but you were too busy playing on your phone. I doubt you care about that class. I do, honestly I do. I just fucked up today. It's long. Lessons just get boring sometimes, you know. They get my brain going about all the shit I'm doing inside the class. You feel ? - Yeah. I get you. - Hey...hmm... Can I get your number ? Maybe we can talk about the assignment, do some research or whatever we're supposed to be doing - Yeah, I don't think so. I'm off to the library - There's a library here ? Just kidding. Of course there's a library here. That's why they keep the books. [Music] - Hey, the library's just closed. You need to leave now. - Yeah...got it Sorry. [Music] - Wow... What are you doing here ? If you wanted the assignments answers so badly, you could have just asked. - No bro. It's not like that. I just got out of my other class, had another lab. - Oh, okay...Hmm... We are timing them, I guess. - Great timing in fact, the library just closed. Did you finish the assignment ? - Yeah, actually I... just submitted it. Bye. - Hey... wait! - Hmm... what you do for dinner ? Are your parents waiting for you ? - No... they are not. Do you live with your parents ? - No, I got my own place. You should come check it out sometime. - Oh...hmm... you're moving a bit fast there for me, buddy. - Oh well... why don't we do dinner ? I'm starving. - And unbelievably persistent. - Wait, I'm sorry I didn't... I didn't mean to bug you like that. I... I just thought maybe... I promise I'll be more respectful. You're really awesome and you're very studious and you'll probably transfer like Berkeley or Harvard or some fancy school like that. - Stanford. - See... same thing. Hello smart school. So... I forgive it. - You are... forgiven but I I still can't go to dinner because I'm... super broke. Dude, don't worry about it. I'll pay as long as you let me pick the restaurant. Take it or leave it. - I... I'm vegetarian. - Really ? Dude, me too. as for today. So... dinner ? [Music] - So, did you submit that assignment or what ? It's... it's due in like an hour - Such a downer dude. We're having so much fun and you had to bring up the homework. - Maybe I could like... come over and... help you out. - Wow. I like your thinking though can we go back to your place ? Mine's a bit messy - I don't mind messy. - I'm sure your place is more comfortable than mine. - Actually that's... that's not gonna work - Oh...! Hmm... I'm sorry did... did I do something wrong ? Can I give you a ride home ? - No, no. no, it's okay. My car's close by Hmm... I actually have a lot of homework to get through, but thank you for dinner. I'll I'll see you in class [Music] [Siren] [Barking of dogs] [Music and barking of dogs] [Knocking] - Holy shit ! - Are you okay ? - What ? - Liam, it's me. - Who ? - Waleed - Yeah, please don't be creeped out. I just want to make sure you're okay - Yeah, I'm fine dude. Can you please step away from the car ? I'm walking away. I'm about 10 feet away. I'm gonna keep walking and then I'm gonna call you when I get to my car. Okay ? - Why are you here ? - Why are you hiding in your car ? - What do you think ? - Oh, shit ! I... I just realized... - Oh... what ? - Are you sleeping in your car ? - It's... It's just temporary... okay ? I'm just in between places. - Oh, that sucks. I'm so sorry I'm an idiot I thought you were just like hiding from me. - No, it's... it's fine. Hmm... could you... could you please not tell anyone though...? - Of course. Liam ? - Yeah. - I haven't been completely honest with you. - About what ? - I live with my parents - Yeah, I... I figured... hmm... honestly, that sounds kind of nice. Mine are hassles - And my grandparents and my three sisters, one older, two younger and two cats which I'm allergic to. - Okay, hmm... maybe not so nice then. - And they're super conservative. So... I don't know how I don't know how I'm ever gonna come out to them unless like we get married. - We'd probably have to elope or something. So, what is it like past your curfew ? - Oh yeah, way past. - Well I mean, there's still 22 minutes left until the assignment is due. Do you want some help ? - Like now ? On the phone ? - Yeah. I mean, I do all my assignments on the phone. It's it's pretty easy. You just, you know... open the assignments tab, you open the modules Tab and you click on the assignment that you need and then you know... [Music till the end]
