- Okay, it's checked. - Thank you. Here. - You should go to the toilet again. - I'm fine. Still, I'm going. ey. What? Are you nervous? Are you alright? Ogawa, don't forget to get warmed up in your waiting room. It was sent to you, Mr. Urita. What's that? - What? - You don't need to know, Chairman. - I don't need to know? What do you mean? - Let me do it. Then I'll help you. Don't use the big one. You're thinner now. - Okay, go fight! - Let's go. Come here. They look like middle school students, right? So it seems. They shouldn't smoke, right? - What the heck? Gosh. - Why shouting? - Maybe they're over 30. - What? Do you think so? Well then, I'll ask that Mr. Model to help. No need. I'll give a good talking to them. Really? Hello, dear customer. May I verify your age? I'm 20. Is that so? Well, may I check your ID? I don't have that crap. I told you, I'm 20. As a rule, you can't smoke if your age is not verified. Then let me ask you. That guy there, did you check his age? No. I'm checking with you because you look young. I just have a baby face! What? Do you discriminate against baby-faced people? That's not true... It's discrimination. I hate discrimination the most! - Middle school kids should just go home! - Shut up! - Mess with me and you'll be sorry! - You bet! - It'll get ugly. Stop that. - I'll finish you. - What do you want? Let go of me! - You wanna fight? Damn you. - Stop being silly! - Get going! - It hurts! - Shut up! It's you who started this quarrel. - But you're clearly under 20. - Shut up! Mess with you and I'll be sorry, right? - That's not the point. - You're the one who should be sorry. Don't mess with people from Kajiwara Middle School! - So you're a middle school student! - Shut up! Ouch! What the heck...? - Poor you. Does it hurt? - I'm fine. Narasaki, I heard that you lost a fight with a middle school kid. I didn't lose. But you're badly beaten. The truth is, I let him beat me. I see. You're a real man. No, Tae. - He's just too timid to fight. - Is that true? No, there are reasons that I couldn't fight him. You're funny. What are the reasons? -The reasons are... -Perhaps... you do boxing, Narasaki? A boxer wouldn't fight amateurs, right? That can't be true. - You're right. - I knew it! My fist is a kind of weapon. Also, I practice "sparkling" every day. So I'm used to being beaten. - That's why. - It's not "sparkling". It's "sparring". - Do you really do boxing? - What? Shut up! You told us you used to be a model. But I never saw you in any magazine. OMAKI BOXING GYM Again. Hang in there. Okay. Hello. You called to join our gym? Yes. Please come in. - Take off your shoes there. - Yes. Firstly, you should practice rope skipping. After that rings, do rope skipping for three minutes. This... is kind of tough, right? Yes, it's tough. But you'll get used to it soon. I don't want to do tough practice. I'd like you to teach me shadowboxing or some cool moves. Well... rope skipping is basic training, though. I'm not aiming to be a boxer. I just want to be perceived as one. I see. Please. Then, assume a boxing stance. Yes. Mr. Narasaki, are you a left‐hander? Yes, I'm a "sunspaw". Is it "southpaw"? - Or "sunspaw"? - It's "southpaw" Or "sunspaw"? "Southpaw". Whatever. Try to assume a boxing stance. Right. Pull your chin in. Relax your shoulders. And jab. As you throw a punch... Exhale like this. Forget shushing for now. - Remain guarding. That's the basic rule. - Yes. - Last set of punching. - Okay. Okay. Good, let's call it a day. - Hello. - Hello. Thank you very much. I feel stronger now. You are too hasty. But it's good to stay positive. Keep practicing and try to become a "look-alike" boxer. Yes. - Good job for today. - Thank you. - It's good to determine that thing. - True. - Hello. - Hello. Ogawa, your battle is decided. Taku Ishibashi. He ranked fourth. - Okay. - Wow, really? If you win, you will be one step closer to the title match. What do you mean "if I win"? - What? I didn't say "if". - You did. You will definitely win, Mr. Ogawa. I wouldn't say "if". Even if I said so, I only meant well. Hey, it's dirty here. Don't forget to wipe the sweat off. - Yes. - Don't worry, I'll do it. You go practice. - Uri Boy. - Yes. You will have the opening fight. It's also decided. Okay. Good. - Last set. - Okay. - Okay. - Thank you. Good job. - Mr. Urita. - What? - Let's drink before reducing weight. - Tonight? - It's bad timing? - Rather than that... today is Chika's birthday. Oh no! It's today. Boy. - Forget it. - You can't. You're right. Gosh. Hey. You forgot my birthday, right? No, I didn't forget. You were reminded by Uri, right? That's not true. Then, what's this? It's... your birthday present? You must have bought this from the Lawson here. - Not from the Lawson here. - No difference. You know, I've been preoccupied with the fight lately. Sorry to interrupt. Any refills on drinks? - I want the same one. - I want Shikuarthur Shower. Shikuwasa Shower. You want Shikuwasa Sour, right? You were not articulate. Also, I'm still waiting for the chicken and scallion skewer. You just ate it. - Don't worry. - Okay. I see. So, tell me... what are these? - Peeled sweet roasted chestnuts. - What? Aren't they delicious? I'm on a diet. You look the same. How would I know? I lost two kilograms. Only two kilograms! Comparing it to boxers' weight loss... Don't compare to it. You didn't notice that I cut my bangs, did you? Kazuki, you pay no attention to me. While you said so, did you notice any change about me? You shaved your beard. Well, I did. Hey. - I'm leaving first. - Okay. - Uri Boy. - Yes. - You will win next time, right? - Yes. - Don't forget to lock the door. - Okay. Welcome. How can I help you? - Well... - Yes? Uri, you've finally come. Sorry. You messaged me many times. I gave you that coupon. It'd be meaningless if it's expired. You're right. Sorry. Come in. Lately, he was inarticulate at times and became forgetful. Isn't it punch drunk syndrome? He's sometimes weird, but it's not that serious. Can you ask him to get checked at the hospital, Uri? Me? Why don't you just tell him? He'd be angry if I told him. Lately, he's quite short-tempered. Kazuki would listen to you, right? Well, but... Your hair is glossy now. You're welcome. Give me a second. I think, for the time being... - you should go to the hospital. - This again? Forget about it. I'm fine. It's okay if you're fine. You, go to the corner. What's that move? - What? - Your move. I read the manga "Hajime no Ippo" yesterday and think Flicker Jab is cool. It's you, the guy who wants to become a "look-alike" boxer. Yeah. Do that Flicker Jab again. Awesome! I never saw the real one. - Really? - Yes, the real fool. A double punch. A one-two punch. Good. Basic training is the most important. A one-two punch. - Yes. - Good. You have more white parts than normal. It's fine if it's temporary. But if it's chronic... you might suffer from dementia. In that case... it'd be difficult to continue your boxing career. - I say... - I won't quit. What? - I didn't say anything. - Really? I won't quit. Please get on the scale. - 300 grams over the limit. - What? What are you doing? Go run there and drop the weight quickly. I checked at home and I fit right in. Maybe my scale is broken. I don't care. Just go running. Rescaling will be in two hours. Thank you. Last set. Okay. Nice. I think it's enough. Sorry to drag you here. You have a fight tomorrow. It's alright. Did Chika tell you anything? That thing? I heard that you yelled at the doctor. I knew that she'd say unnecessary things. But no problem with your brain, right? That's great. Yeah. More importantly, you'd really retire if you lose? She's too annoying so we had a fight. I said that on a whim. Don't say she's annoying. Of course she'd worry about you. So, what would you do if you lose? I won't lose anyway. You're right. Okay, let's go rescaling. Down! Stop! Good fight. Ogawa, why haven't you changed clothes yet? - Idiot. - I'll change soon. So embarrassing. I lost again. Take a good rest. - But you looked cool. - You don't need to comfort me. I was beaten all the way to the end. It was a shame. - But you looked really cool. - You don't have to say that. I'm used to losing. I don't mind people saying it's funny to see me knocked out flamboyantly. The way you fell down was over the top. Right? You can rarely witness a man... get knocked out so ridiculously. I see. So, I was lucky enough to see this rare event? You're really strong‐minded to cheer yourself up after losing quickly. Shut up. Enough about me. Ogawa will definitely win, so don't worry. You're right. You don't want him to win? I don't know. I shouldn't be like this, right? I wouldn't know things you don't know. I'm stupid. - Thank you. - Next customer, please. - Welcome. - One coke, please. - Here. - Oh, thank you. It's about time for Ogawa to get on the stage, right? - Uri. - Huh? I like the way you fight, even if you don't look cool. Kazuki Ogawa is approaching the blue corner. Ogawa! You have to win this, okay? Don't lose to him. Ogawa! Even Chairman found a weak opponent, he still couldn't win. - He really fits the blue corner. - The blue corner? The champion's in the red corner, and the challenger's in the blue corner. - I see. - Counting today, he lost ten times. Two wins and ten losses. I've never seen anyone with so many losses. Really? He knows he's weak, so he retired once. But he came back and had more losses. He's a real challenger. If we could find the entrance, it should be okay. Good job. Nice fight. You're doing great. Why are you looking disappointed? - I'm not. - You are. So, you wanted me to lose? - I never thought that. - Calm down. Take a seat. Nice fight. You've improved a lot. - Really? - Yes. Narasaki, you have enough strength and practice a lot. - You should grow fast. - Really? - How long have you been with us? - I think... half a year. I see. Then, it's time for you to spar. No. Sparring means beating each other, right? Of course. I can't do it. I don't want to get hurt. Then why did you come here? Even if you say so... It's your first time sparring. - It won't hurt. Don't worry. - You're sure that it won't hurt? - You promise? - Yes. Don't worry. I'll spar with you. He's also training to be a professional boxer. That's a good idea. I think... - I won't do it today. - Someone help him wear gloves. - Okay. - What? I didn't promise to do it. He's staring at me. I'm dead, I'm dead. He will definitely kill me. - Open your mouth. - Wait. Whose is this? - This? Everyone shares. - Everyone shares? Then it's dirty. Just buy one if you care. - What? - Here. The sparring starts. Go. You throw a jab, too. - Do it seriously. - Hey, punch him! A good one-two punch. Doguchi, you want to be a pro with that weak performance? - Wait... - Hey, fight back! Mr. Narasaki, keep your guard up. Stop! Fight him back! - It hurts! - Fight back. - Guard up. Look at your opponent. - Help me! Ouch! I'm sorry. That's why I didn't want to do it. It hurts a lot! You guys got heated up. I don't want to do it anymore. But you threw a good one-two punch without moving too much. Don't you feel accomplished? I do. I'm going to do my training programs. Take it. You're cooking something delicious. Oh, this isn't food. - No? - Sorry. I woke you up. Good night. It's hot! A one-two punch. Do it more compactly and quickly. Come. Okay. - Don't forget to remain on guard. - Yes. Speed up. Good. You've gotten better, Narasaki. Do that again. Go. There you go. That's it. (URI: 62.8 KILOGRAMS) Too late. You should pull as soon as it sinks. I tried. You're too late. You can't dodge a punch like that. I don't have to dodge punches. Got you. See? This time my counterpunch was precise. I see. You're doing great. Hey. - Be careful. - You should ride in a straight line. Done. Let's change. Give me a rub. Wait. Rub my shoulders. - We can't do it. - Why? I'm on my period. See? We can take a shower later. No. There will be blood on the bed. Man! There are some old towels. We can use them to cover the bed. What? Huh? What am I looking for here? What? Aren't you looking for the old towels? Right. Hello. How's it going? I see. That's unfortunate. No, don't say that. That's true. Chika is by my side. Do you want to talk to her? Okay. Right. Goodbye. Was that Uri? He lost? Two to one, it's the judges' decision. - He's coming back to Tokyo now. - I see. What a pity. We should go support him. He laughed and said we don't need to go all the way to Osaka to support him. I see. Hey. Your friend lost and you still want to... What's wrong? My head aches suddenly. Are you alright? Kazuki? No. Not like this. - Ten seconds left. - Okay. Done! I'm hungry. Wait. I heard about you. - Yes? - You've kept losing? That's true. I'm embarrassed. You're not young anymore. You can't do this forever. Haven't you tried findng a job? - Finding a job? - Yes. Is it fun to keep doing fruitless things like this? It's not about fun, but there's nothing else that I want to do. - Really? - Yes. Look carefully. Nice. Okay. Throwing punches. Good. Nice guard. Good. - Good moves. - Carefully. Watch out! Look at him. Done. - Are you alright? - Yeah. Uri Boy, you're good at throwing punches up and down. Now, you have to improve your moves from left to right. You fool. He is your senior boxer. You should be more considerate. His punches are powerful. Thank you very much. Hey! You should take the test, too. He'll take the professional boxer test, you should go with him. No. I'm fine with being an amateur. What? Mexican boxers often throw "bollard" punches. Isn't that cool? Listen, don't throw that kind of punch today. What? Sorry to keep you waiting. Oh, boy. You didn't forget anything? How about the gloves? No need. Use the ones they've prepared there. Okay. It's just the professional boxer test. Don't be nervous. I'm not nervous. Don't worry. You can take the test again if you fail. You're right. If you fail, we can take the test together again. What? I won't fail. Sorry. Should we discuss this with Chairman? If people find out, his license will be suspended. It's an important time for him now. I understand the importance. But the book says that it could be a life-long illness. Uri, you should also warn him. About what? It's better for him to stop boxing. I can't say that. Fine. He doesn't have to stop. Just don't attend matches. Do it for his good health. It'd be meaningless then. Aren't you his friend, Uri? You're not worried? I'm worried. I was shocked when I learned about it. But that's not enough to ask him to quit. Then let me ask you. If you were Kazuki, what would you think? If you act more and more strangely, and suffer from headaches... can you still say the same thing? I can. It's the Japan Championship after all. To people like me, it's a dream. If I could achieve it, I would pay any price. I see. I'm going to the restroom. - That's not cute. - It's cute. The cutest! - Not really. - I want to put the blue one next. The blue one? - Whatever. - Give it to me. What are you doing? Thank you. Is this Narasaki's? Thank you. What's this? How should I put it? It's a Professional Boxer Licence. Really? Amazing! You became a pro boxer? Actually, it was so troublesome. But people around me wouldn't let me waste my talent. That's incredible! Look, he's a pro boxer now. - Well... - It's nothing. You're so cool. Really? I don't accept it. Why did I fail the test? You threw big punches like a fool and hit the opponent by chance. But I beat him. The professional test is not about beating the opponent. It emphasizes the balance of offense and defense, and the proper form. Well, try your best next time. Your guard is loose now. Keep your upper arms close to the body. Try again. Okay. Again. Don't loosen your guard. Get back to the form after punching. Again. What's wrong? I have my own style. It's difficult to follow yours, Mr. Urita. However... it's the basic move. Basic moves can make you strong? Mr. Urita, you are not strong at all. Right. I couldn't win those fights. I don't want to learn boxing from a loser. It's enough for today. Thank you. - I'm leaving now. - Goodbye. Get lost. Don't worry about small delivery mistakes. You must focus on boxing right now. - I'm really sorry. - Don't be. Our company's name is on your boxing trousers. You should win the championship and promote our company. Doguchi, guard up. - Watch out for your left and right sides. - That was a good move. Don't throw big punches. Left and right. Don't back down. Doguchi, remain guarding. Nice. Go for it. Okay. Mr. Urita, aren't you a pro boxer? As a pro, you got hit so many times. Don't you think your style is wrong? I think you have a good sense and are actually strong. But lacking basic techniques made you fail the pro test. That's unreasonable. Weaklings knowing basic moves can be pros. Your basic techniques are impeccable, but you're too weak. Is that professional? He raised hands to guard frequently only because he's terrified during the test. If he can become a pro, then so can everyone. Is that so? Then... please spar with me. Huh? What's that? You think you're stronger after passing the pro test? - Chairman. - Yes? - May I spar with Mr. Doguchi? - Good. Just do it. Go. Don't be pushed. Return to your form. Narasaki, don't get heated. Maintain the basic form. Doguchi, guard up. Guard up, hey. Good. Your guard is loose. Guard up. See? Your guard is loose. Throw a jab. Yes, that's right. Punch him again. - Guard up. - Forward. - Doguchi, guard up. - Nice hook. Guard up. Don't throw big punches. Guard up. Wait... Doguchi, guard up. Guard up. Watch your body. - Wait... - Good. Guard up! Doguchi, guard up. Nice counterpunch. Hey, stop! - Doguchi, are you alright? - I'm fine. - Go lie down there. - I'm fine. Shinagawa, switch with him and spar with Narasaki. Okay. Are you alright? - I'm fine. - Stand up. Take off your gloves. - You go there. - Okay. Let me. - Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. You did well. You can attend matches anytime now. - Can I? - Yeah. You should be confident. You are more talented than me. No way. But recently, I don't think it's a bad idea to attend matches. Actually, I'd like to attend matches. You finally awakened. Hey, Doguchi. Are you alright? Hey. What's wrong? Doguchi! - Hey, Doguchi! - Uri Boy, call an ambulance. Roger that. Bring some ice here. A bit left. Move to the back. - Okay, keep it there. - Would it obstruct your view? It's fine. Forceps, please. A bit backward. Please hold it with your right hand. It was a usual practice. No one saw this coming. - Right? - Yes. We did the training program as usual. After sparring, he climbed down the boxing ring by himself. We never thought things could have turned out like this. I see. Do you want to eat something? Your dad will buy anything for you. - Pudding. - Pudding? Just one? - I want two. - Two? It's only pudding. We can buy a lot and put them in the refrigerator. You don't need to buy that many. Hello. Come in. - We'll go shopping. Take your time. - Thanks. How do you feel now? I feel okay, just doing nothing. I'm fine. What's with that face? Hey. Stop crying. Doguchi said that he wanted you to keep boxing for him. Pull yourself together. I will. I told you to stop crying. It'll be fine. Yes. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Ogawa, the championship match is decided. Uri Boy, your match too. Nonetheless, Narasaki. Your debut match is also decided. Okay. Coming. - Hello. - I'm going in. Right. Look, he did it again here. When he moves forward and gives body punches, he'll loosen the guard. - He got hit several times before. - It's true. His guard is loose. So... when he gives body punches... you throw an uppercut. It should work. Well, only one uppercut... may not knock him out. We should practice the attacks afterwards. I think so. However... When he throws a left body punch, I could take a back step. A left hook counterpunch might knock him out. What? It's too difficult. The safest way is... blocking his punches and throwing an uppercut. I think I can make it. Like this. I think it's possible. Well, it's difficult to aim to do that. Too difficult. Mr. Urita, before worrying about my match, you should focus on yours first. I will do my best too. But you're the hope of bringing the championship to our gym after 30 years. Mr. Urita... If I win this match, I'll marry Chika. Really? Then you must win. Is it okay for me to win? Huh? What are you talking about? Coming. - What's with the loud footsteps? - I didn't make loud footsteps. The tenant downstairs complained about your loud footsteps. - We didn't make loud footsteps, right? - No loud footsteps. But there were actually super noisy and loud footsteps. The landlord was indeed pestering. But you didn't have to be angry like that. I sincerely apologized, but she kept nagging. I've considered moving, so it's a good thing after all. Right. That apartment is too small for both of you to live in together. Hey. Isn't this AC remote controller from the last place? - You shouldn't bring it here. - You're right. It's better to bring it back soon. I don't want to go back to see that landlord. I'll do the rest. Bring it back quickly. Thank you. I'll borrow your bike, Chika. Is it also an after-effect? No, he's just stupid. Right. Uri. How do you roll this? - You want me to roll it for you? - Yes. - Is it too tight? - It's fine. Uri. Why did you start boxing? Did you want to be stronger? It's you who suggested I do boxing. - Me? No way. - It's true. I had never been bullied before. But you thought I might be bullied in high school... so you suggested I learn boxing. I never said that. You did. What? I might have said something like this. If that's the reason, I'm sorry. Why say sorry? Because... I changed your life dramatically. That's true. Big changes. - Not just me, but many others too. - What? It's your suggestion that made me start boxing. Then I suggested Ogawa do boxing. And you met him. All that has led us here. Right. Do you regret it? I don't regret it. But... There's no "but" about it. Okay, it's done. Wow! Your mouth. You looked like an octopus. - No, I didn't - You did. You are so mean! - I wasn't like that! - You were. Try to do it again. - See? You're doing that. - I'm not. Attack first. Nice lead jab. Fight back. That's right. Yes, take the initiative. - Nice. - That's nice. Yes. Great. That's right. Three punches. Up and down. Compactly! Look at him. Good. Nice. Throw a counterpunch carefully. Take the initiative! Nice uppercut! - Nice. - Stop. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thanks, everyone. - Thanks. Nice. Good uppercuts after his body blows. That would be useful during the match. Your straight has a long reach. - You're also good at counterpunches. - That's flattering. - It's difficult to fight with you. - That's why I aimed at his body. You did it in the last part. - My body hurt a lot. - Really? He's a good boxer, he's tall and has a long reach. No, he still needs to improve. You need to bring back a championship. You must worry about the funds, right? - I heard that. - Well... You're right. One of our trainers got injured. If he were a pro boxer, the payment would be covered by insurance. It must be tough for you to pay medical expenses and consolation money. Well, I barely made it. - Excuse me. - Yes? I received a call from here. My name is Narasaki. - Where is the manager? - This way, please. Manager. I'm sorry about that. It's fine. She doesn't seem to be a habitual offender. All she took was a sweet bean jelly costing 100 yen. However, we got reported about her theft. Well, our manager... Grandma, are you hungry? Sorry, I'm not at home lately. You know... As a pro boxer, my debut match will be the day after tomorrow. Isn't it great? I'm actually terrified. But I want to win. I really want to win. - Okay, it's checked. - Thank you. What would happen if I pee in the ring? Hey, don't pee your pants. I ate too much after the weigh-in. You should go to the toilet again. I'm fine. Still, I'm going. Hey. - What? Are you nervous? - No, I'm taking a dump. Are you alright? Ogawa, don't forget to get warmed up in your waiting room. It was sent to you, Mr. Urita. What's that? - What? - You don't need to know, Chairman. - I don't need to know? What do you mean? - Let me do it. - Then I'll help you. - Thanks. Don't use the big one. You're thinner now. There's no data about your opponent today. Since you're experienced, I think you would win. I can't lose to a guy who just debuted. Here enter both fighters. Can Uri win this fight? The opponent's a thirty-something amateur. No need to worry. It's late to debut after 30 years old. There are dummies like this. They do boxing for fitness... and want to attend a match once for memory-making. Here. Wait. I have a bad feeling. Although it's his boxing debut, he used to be a kickboxer. And he's a very experienced one. Don't let him get away. Keep attacking. Just focus on yourself. ROUND THREE, REMAINING TIME 1' 27” - You can beat him. - Higa, stop fooling around. What's the problem with him? He's not making an all-out effort. He can win, but he's trying to drag the match longer. We should throw in the towel quickly. It's dangerous. Uri... Okay, go fight. Down! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... What? No. Just lie down. I'm fine. Please let me walk on my own feet. - Urita, you did well. - Nice fight. That punch landed. One, two, three, four, five, six seven, eight... Down! Are you alright? Are you okay? Can you stand? He saw your weak point. Are you alright? Your expression was too obvious. It showed that punches on your belly were effective. I see. That's why he aimed there. You should retrain your body. I'm sorry. There's no excuse, idiot. Boxing matches are unpredictable. You should beat him as soon as possible. But it's boring to knock him out too soon. You dummy. You can say that only because he's too weak. - Here's your order. - Then find a suitable opponent for me. - Thank you. -Don't be so cheeky, idiot. - Don't make me spill the drinks. - I want to drink. Give it to me. - Next customer, please. - A bottle of water, please. - No problem. Ogawa, keep the distance. Break! He went for the head! Stop! Take a deep breath. Don't attack forward carelessly. Keep the distance for your safety. Remember to shake your head. And guard thoroughly. Okay, go! Break! Ogawa, fight him back with your uppercut! Great. Raise your arms and guard. Fight back with your uppercut! When he hits your body, throw an uppercut back! We practiced that, right? Ogawa! Hey, Ogawa! Hit him! Ogawa, attack! He's aiming at you now. It's a good chance to knock him out. Throw it! It's a winning chance. Use that uppercut to beat him. Ogawa. He's aiming at your body now. Hit him! Stop! Break! - He committed a foul. - Ogawa, he's coming. Hey, it hurts. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven... When he throws a left body punch... a back step with a left-hook counterpunch might knock him out. Nine... Go. After all... you're incredible. The shiny new Japanese Super Welterweight Champion is... Kazuki Ogawa. Congratulations. Thank you. What was the reason for your victory? Mr. Urita, who trains at the same gym as me... he analyzed the moves of Mr. Azuma for me. That's why I can win. Can you tell us the details of his analysis? When Mr. Urita approaches and throws left and right body blows... No. When Mr. Azuma approaches and throws left and right body blows... his guard is loose and I should hit back. That's his analysis. Should I call it analysis? It's more like a tactic or a strategy. Anyway, when Mr. Urita aims at my body... You mean Mr. Azuma, right? Right, Mr. Azuma... When Mr. Azuma... Well... What are we talking about? Please tell us the details of his analysis. Well... Thank you for waiting. The beers are here. - I'll take them. - Thanks. - I'm leaving them for you. - Okay. - Please drink. - Thank you. Uri, you shouldn't work so hard after your match. Indeed. Let the younger ones do it. It's fine. Resilience is my sole advantage. Wait. I told you that you can't drink alcohol, Narasaki. Okay, I heard you. After a match, the veins in your brain are injured. - Alcohol will cause veins to expand... - I said... I heard you. Uri. Yes. - Is this okay? - Please write "for Manager". - Okay, it's done. - Thank you. - Thank you, Champion. - You're welcome. - Your signature is ugly. - I never did it before. How can you still smile like this? - Don't you feel frustrated? - Yes, I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated, but... if you could transform frustration into strength... Into strength? You don't have the strength, do you? You lose every match. You're right. I don't want to listen to advice from a person who loses every time. I told you that you shouldn't drink alcohol. If you didn't just finish a match, I'd hit you harder. Sorry. - We're going this way. - See you next time, Uri. Bye. Actually... I wished you would lose the match today. No, not just today. I've always been... wishing you would lose. What's with you, Uri? You got hit too hard? It's okay. I knew it. Really? Yes. I won't be able to come tomorrow. I'll go learn belly dancing. - I heard that's good for you. - Yes. Turn your hip like this. It will burn your fat. Should I take belly dancing lessons, too? Want to give it a try? Hello. Hey. Is it straight? The right side should move up a bit. That's it. Like this? Thank you. - Doing daytime training today? - I have a night shift. Where is Mr. Urita? - Uri Boy had left. - Why? He decided to quit after the last match. I never heard of it. He asked me to keep it secret from everyone. Turn your hip faster. That fast? Can you do it? - I can do it. - It hurts. Oh my. Hey, you, this isn't a dance studio. Unfortunately. Oops. Take the initiative. Right. Up and down. Right. Mr. Ogawa, you didn't know he wanted to retire either? Really? He didn't show it during the celebration. I'm shocked. Why treat us like strangers? He could have just told us. He didn't want to spoil the celebration. That's why he didn't tell us. I haven't returned his DVD of Mike Tyson. Hey, the gong just rang. I'm going to take the picture. Please be ready. Say cheese. One more. Say cheese. That was good. Thanks. Let me check the photos. - You looked like a robot. - It's because Chairman was here. I was doing my old boxing form. Everybody, last shot. Please be ready. Say cheese. Okay. Go. A jab and one-two punches. - Okay. - Sorry. Okay, nice. And... what's your name again? I'm Narasaki. Sorry, Mr. Narasaki. Your form is well-balanced. - Thank you. - Once more. One-two punches. Well, I guess we can say that about the both of us. I see. Right. Another match you say? - Wow! - Why raise your voice? Nothing. It's nothing, please continue. What weight class are we talking about? I see. Is that so. Who? Higa? I see. The opponent for Mr. Higa? You got me. We don't have a suitable boxer. Yes. Can I shower first? - Of course. - Then I'll be next. I can just leave. Don't worry. Please let me do it. I'm begging you. You watched the match that Uri Boy had with him, right? He's strong. I know. I'm asking something unreasonable. But I want to do it. You want revenge for Uri Boy? TSUYOSHI NARASAKI VS. RYOTARO HIGA Right. See? Throw a punch back. See? Seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay. 90 degrees. - Yes. - Raise your legs. One, two, three... Don't drop your legs. Four, five, six... Seven, eight, nine, ten. That's it! Again! Okay. Right, Mr. Mikami. - What? - I... I saw the work you modeled for. - Huh? - Really? You used to be famous, right? PHIMOSIS TREATMENT What's this ad about? A beauty treatment? Your energy is high. Boxing is the only thing I have. Great! Hey, you're noisy. Hey. Do you know where my match shorts are? You pulled them out yesterday and put them there. I see. You washed them yesterday. Really? Are you alright? I'm fine. Bring me a dustcloth. Are you really okay? I told you, I'm fine. Maybe it's better to quit the match. It's too late to quit now. Shut up, stupid. Do you remember your promise? 69.9 kilograms. It's at the limit. What? I'll also be in the red corner tomorrow? Yes, because you are on my side. I see. It's strange. After all, I've never won a match. The colors only matter in championship matches. It's the organizer's choice. I see. When I look at the blue corner, I'd think of Mr. Urita. I wanted to see him win once. Quite a while ago... after he won a match... "Only I could dodge that hook..." "My counterpunch had the perfect timing..." He bragged like that endlessly. Everyone was annoyed. Really? That must be annoying. But he looked super happy. It made me think that he must really like boxing. That reminds me, I only talked about boxing with Mr. Urita. - He's got boxing on the brain. - Very enthusiastic. But your love of boxing is no less than his, right? I wonder. Am I as passionate as he is? I don't know. But that's why you won the championship. Well, passion and talent are different. You said it. Right. Mr. Urita sent this to us. Even though I said something rude before he left. Mr. Urita is really kind. NARASAKI IS STRONG! YOU CAN DEFINITELY WIN! Actually, he is strong. What? Pay him back by winning the match, since you're his last student. Hey, don't be terrified. Wow! I'm not terrified. Fourth round of the lightweight class. Entering both fighters. - Let's go. - Okay, go! Go fight! Narasaki, good luck. Great. Go for it! Good. Nice punch. Guard. Remain guarding. Don't loosen your guard. Okay. Left. Don't go forward. Higa, are you alright? Are you okay? Dodge his attacks. The blue fighter is stronger. No, the red fighter is simply weaker. I'm going to the toilet. Don't do such foolish things, idiot. When you turn right, he'll aim at you. I see. ROUND TWO, REMAINING TIME 3' 0” Okay. One, two, three, four... Don't overswing. Think of the training. Eight... Our usual trainings... More quickly and compactly. Good. Again. Right. More quickly and compactly. That's right. Use more footwork. Keep my own distance. Go in and out repeatedly. Mix with feints and use potshots. Arrange your soft and heavy punches. When you get hit, keep cool. Block his attacks calmly. When he stops, counterpunch. Throw punches up and down. If the opponent overswings... look carefully, and don't strain yourself. Minimize your motion. - Left. - Left. Our judges are Satoru Inoue, Noriaki Hamaguchi, and Shinya Sada. They all scored 38-36. Three to zero. It's a unanimous decision. The winner is... Ryotaro Higa. - How's your husband's match? - I think he's fighting now. Sorry to make you work at this important time. Don't say that. It's me who always asks him to take a rest. - Is the next round the final round? - It's round eight, stupid. - Are you alright? - So two rounds left. Three rounds left. Attention, please. In the last seventh round... Kazuki Ogawa in the red corner received a cut upon his right eye. This cut was hit by Shinobu Charlie Hosokawa in the blue corner. And that punch was effective. Okay. Go for it. Great. That punch landed. Nice attack. Hey, referee. The opponent is groggy. Stop them. Stop! Great! Dottore. I can still fight. I can do it! I can still fight! - Did you doze off? - No. I thought I drove in a straight line. When I realized, it was turning left. Are you taking some drugs? No, I'm not. Recently my hands would go numb... Go numb... numb... I'm really sorry. What's wrong with you? Recently you got in a lot of trouble. You just made a mistake some time ago. - Yes, I did. - I hope you can focus on work. - I'm sorry. - It's your job after all. Give me a break. - I'm back. - Welcome home. Another bowl of rice? No need to worry anymore, just eat it up. No. I already gained weight. You aren't thinking about returning to boxing, right? I'm not. - Your brain can't take damage... - I'm not thinking about it. Mr. Ogawa. Hey. - Are you... - Shut up. I haven't said anything yet.
