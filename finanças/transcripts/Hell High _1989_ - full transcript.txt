'Brooke! I don't want you running off. 'Don't you dare go to the swamp! 'You'ii get a spanking.' j“ all day, all day, all the children playing j“ always, always, all the children play j“ all night, all night, all the children sleeping j“ all night, all night, life is but a dream j“ Come on, little Brooke, let's go. Little Brooke, let's go to our little playhouse. These grounds are lots of fun, little Brooke. Let's go! It's good to be home. How about some lunch? Come on, you noisy doll! See what you made me do? If you would just... Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Come on! - I don't feel safe here. - How can you not feel safe? Come on, we haven't got all day! I don't like this place. What's there not to like? Come on, let's go. Fucking bitch! Come on! Did everyone study for the test? Mr. Dickens, put that back! Go back to your table! Ribbit! - Is everyone ready for the test? - No. - No. - Yeah, I... Alright, use only no. 2 pencils, please. Why is it always a no. 2 pencil? Because the lead is harder. Not the only thing that's hard... Esophagus. The testes. Ugh! The gallbladder. The heart. Elizabeth! Turn back around! No talking to your neighbor! She doesn't miss a trick. The last organ is the spleen. Alright, you can put your pencils down. Mr. Dickens, you collect the papers. Let's see if you can do one thing right. Smiler! I'm sorry, miss storm. Sometimes, don't you just want to kill me? Class, you don't understand learning, do you? I'm here to help you, if you'll only give me a chance. Biology is important! I'd be embarrassed. Get off me! You're dead. Class! Class, what does it take to reach you people? She doesn't know how far I'll take this. Mr. Dickens, file those test papers. These test papers, ma'am? File them. Did you say, "file them"? - File them. - Yes, ma'am. They're filed. That doesn't finish it, not by a long shot. I'm gonna stick it to that bitch. Damn! I'm gonna nail her ass. Hey, what good would it do? - Where's it gonna end? - It ends with me. This town ain't big enough for the both of 'em. Listen to me, couldn't we talk about this? No, we can't talk about it. All I want's an explanation. This whole thing doesn't make any... You're off the team, that's all there's to it. You're a coward. We got a new recruit. Hey, guys! Hey, look, man, I don't want to fight with you anymore cos you're a great athlete, and you're a real man. Although I hear that most football players are homosexuals. Is this true? I bet you really go for it when you come up behind the center on each and every player, huh? Football's for queers. Come on, man. Hey, Jon-Jon, I hear you quit being a football hero. In fact, I hear you're kind of a coward. Look, dickens, what do you want? Well, they say you're a coward, and they say that I'm a crazy son of a bitch no good for nothing. Yeah? So, what's the point? Well, we have a good time. And we're all rejects from this place. All they're trying to do at this school is mold us into exactly everything that we hate. Huh! I don't know, dickens, I heard some pretty strange things about you. Look what they say about you. Look, we have a good time. Prove it to those jerk-off football players that you don't need their kind. Why not? What have I got to lose? Nothing. Well, well, well! I'm surprised you'd even show your face around here. Nobody quits the team! You're a coward. I expect you to have your uniform at my office as soon as possible. What's going on? Brooke, you ok? Brooke? It's me, coach heaton. Hey, what's wrong? What are you doing here? Well, uh... I just thought I'd drop down and see if, uh... What? If you'd like to go to the game tomorrow. You could watch the boys play. It's good for school morale. No. No. And then after the game, later, we could go out, and, uh... - No. - Do anything you might like. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, come on! It'd be fun! Uh, Sandy hand told me that, uh... You might like to get out. I don't need to get out. Did you have some trouble with those punk kids today? I... I can take care of myself, thank you. Well... Itned. Thank god it's Friday. Another tough day. - So, what do you wanna do tonight? - Mm, get laid. Aren't you ever satisfied? Seeing coach heaton bulging down the hall really put me in the mood. - He's so dumb, he'd never find his way in. - Or out. I'm not sure heaton would know what to do with it if he couldn't bounce it or kick it. You're so cute. Hey, we ought to go down to the swamp tonight. That place gives me the creeps. Hey, two kids were killed down there. What are you, scared? That legend is a myth. Nobody killed nobody eighteen years ago. Not tonight, I gotta have dinner with my parents. Dinner? With your parents? Oh, come on! Let's cause a little trouble. - You're dangerous. - Maybe. - Better not blow my future, dickens! - The future is now, man. Oh! Look, I gotta fix this bike. I'll see you guys tomorrow at the game. Yeah, tomorrow. The football game. - Gmm. - I'll need a ride to the game. - Jon-Jon can pick you up tomorrow. - Yeah, sure. Good. Dickens can tell you how to get to my house. Ok. Bye. - Yo! Yo, Brooke! Hey, look... - What have I hit? Nothing. It was just me getting your attention. Hey, you gotta try and relax! So, you wanna take off? No, not just yet. Listen, did coach heaton talk to you? - Oh, yes, he wanted me to go this silly... - Yeah, I know what he wanted. You know, Brooke, I think you ought to go with him. You need a change in your routine. - I don't even like him that much. - Oh, what difference does that make? You just need to be getting out more. Maybe you're right. You know, Brooke, you've lived your whole life in that house, you've isolated yourself from the world. It's not healthy. Ok, ok, I'll go to this silly game. What do I care? Well, good. Look, I'll have coach heaton call you later, ok? - I don't care. - Alright? '...Real soon, because they're all gonna be out real soon. 'We've got a request here...' I'm getting an idea. Praise the lord! J“ there's no reason to fight cos you never win j“ I'm on the outside looking in j“ now, he's with her right before my eyes j“ the joke's on me, what a big surprise j“ so, I say, "take me home"... j“ so, who are we after? You know, if! Didn't know better, I'd say it's miss storm. You do know better, asshole. That is miss storm. - We're playing with fire. - Yeah, maybe we'll get burned. We gotta stay clear of the teachers, man. I don't wanna blow my a in biology. Look, how far are we gonna take this? All the way. I don't like the stink of it. You don't like the stink of nothing. Look, I just got one year left of my sins at this damn school, then I'm free, and I don't wanna blow it. There's nothing after high school. There's only more stink. Come on! - Shit! - What? What? What? Shh! Oh, shit! - That's what I call a fun... - Shh! Don't blow it! Shit! That dirty bitch! She got... I can't believe it. Yeah! Shit! She digs it! Sure. She could dig it lots more. Lots more! Baby, don't stop now. Don't stop, baby. No, don't stop. - Hello? - What a time for a phone call! Ah, coach heaton. Yes. Yes, I'd like to go. Mm-hmm. No. No, I changed my mind. I... I just, uh... I need to get out. Come on! No. Yes. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, right. Look, man, we're taking a chance just coming here. Let's go. Ok, ok, fine. Yeah! Fine! I'll be ready. - Dickens! - Right. Dickens, come on, let's go, man. Dickens, come on! J“ I feel that you have never left my side j“ dreaming j“ when you're away, it's just a frame of mind j“ I even hear your voice j“ I'm calling out for you to come to me j“ so, I close my eyes j“ and I fantasize j“ I got, uh... one wish j“ one kiss j“ that's all I need to keep me going j“ I got one day j“ one way j“ if! Ever made it feel right j“ America! - Hello? - I'm upstairs. J“ I'm calling out for you to come to me j“ so, I close my eyes j“ and I fantasize... j“ hi! Hi! Come on in. Sit down. - We're gonna have so much fun tonight. - Yeah... where are your parents? They're gone. - You feel ok? - Yeah. Yeah. - That's a nice room. - Thanks. It's a mess. I've got to clean it up. - My mother... - Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. - Listen... - Mm-hmm? You know dickens. What do you think of him? He's a creep. He's never in control. - But he knows how to do one thing. - Yeah? How to have a good time. Hey! Weren't you, like, "Mr. Football" earlier this week? Yeah, I was. But that's all over now. I got tired of being hit. - Now I'm supposedly a coward. - Oh, that's bullshit. Growing up, nothing less. A couple of days, and your life is completely different. That's the way I want it. That's the way I got it. Turn around, I'm gonna put on a different top. Uh... sure. Well? Come on, let's go. J“ one way j“ if! Ever made it feel right j“ Asshole! Hey, you people, party time! So, what have we missed? What do you mean? The game. What's happening? - Where's dickens? - Down the lake, as usual. Hey, hotshot. Did you score? I fumbled. Well, now they're gonna take a knife, and they're gonna open up your leg. Do you want me to give them a head start? You're sorry, dickens. I want you to think about this knife when they put you under for that operation. Down! - It's about time. - They don't need you out there, do they? They sure need something. Some fucking brains is what they need. Why do they do it? The team has got to do something, you know? And so do we. What are we gonna do? We gotta take care of Jon-Jon tonight. Or at least I'd like to. Igotanidea. A page one headline. - Whip it? - You'd better believe it. A touchdown! Come on. Let's go. J“ I trust in you j“ whether it's wrong or right j“ you question the life we share j“ somehow it don't seem fair j“ to lay my trust in you j“ I'll be the day and night j“ maybe we'll see this through j“ I'll be waiting here for you... j“ Yeah! J“ I trust in you j“ whether it's wrong or right j“ you question the life we share j“ somehow it don't seem fair j“ to lay my trust in you j“ I'll be the day and night j“ maybe we'll see this through j“ I'll be waiting here j“ waiting for you j“ trust in you - j“ love we share - j“ if you want my side - j“ see this through - j“ you'd better realize j“ trust in you j“ love we share - j“ see this through - j“ with the love we share j“ trust in you - j“ it don't seem fair - j“ the love we share j“ see this through - j“ trust in you - j“ we will see this through - j“ love we share - j“ I'll be waiting here - j“ waiting for you - j“ see this through j“ trust in you j“ love we share j“ see things through j“ trust in you j“ love we share j“ I'll be glad when I get out of here. I'm gonna move west, make some money. Maybe check out college. Yeah, I hear you. So, what do you want to do tonight? I've been thinking about it. There's something in my head, and I gotta get it out. What is it? We gotta go down to the swamp first. Man, I don't like that place. It's part of the plan. Plan? We have a plan? Tonight, I have the ultimate plan. This plan doesn't have anything to do with miss storm, does it? We're gonna do this right. You're sure you don't want me to come in? Oh, no, I... I don't feel well. I'll, uh... I'll call you some other time. - Sorry about the game. - Oh, it was fine. Fine. I'll just come in. No! I'll, uh... I'll be ok. I'll see you at school. Those kids really let me down. If we'd won the game, she couldn't have waited to get me in the sack. Those little bastards made me look bad. They better pray tomorrow never comes. Huh! Alright! Everybody... Fill these bags up with slime. We're gonna meet back at the car. - How are we gonna...? - Look. If you're gonna have a good time, you gotta take some chances, right? Just trust me. It's gonna be great. Let's go. Remember... People have died here. Ugh! Dickens! Shit, I hate this! I can't live like this. Look, I can take care of myself. Goddamn! Queenie! Queenie, is that you? There's a load out there. Does this place scare you? This story has more holes in it than I can count. I don't know. - I was down here with this guy once, and... - What, smithy? He always brings girls down here and gives them that scare shit. That's how he gets women. You didn't fall for that, did you? Oh, yeah. It's just a bunch of nonsense. Well, you have to admit, it's a pretty good place to kill someone. What a night! I can't believe I'm here. Yo, queenie, I like you a lot. I like you, too. I'm not scared anymore. - What, you can't take a joke? - How long were you out there? Awhile. Let's go, we've got enough slime. Queenie, hold up a minute! Yeah, what do you want? Could you help me with this bag? I think I've put a little too much slime in it. Empty some of this shit. Yeah, sounds like a good idea. Hey, watch it! When are you gonna learn that doesn't work, you jerk? What's the deal? You like Jon-Jon? - I'm the boss. - "Boss"! Look, I like Jon-Jon. Makes a difference, you know? Fucking girls! Always trying to break my balls! Smiler! Smiler! Let's get the fuck out of here. Come on, everybody. Looking good. Right, now, we might need these, just in case that bitch catches a glimpse of us. Anyway, these should scare the shit out of her. Look, I don't wanna do any more than what we talked about, ok? We're out of our league just by being here. Yeah, right. A little scare... And we're out of here. - The masks are just for protection. - It's not that I'm scared. But she's real. This is big-time stuff and real trouble if we blow it. What do you mean, "she's real"? She's just another victim. And besides, everybody knows you're just a coward, Jon-Jon. Alright, we're gonna scare the shit out of her. Now look, no talking until I say so, right? - You sure this will work? - Absolutely. Look, everyone's heard the legend of the swamp, right? Even miss storm. She'll freak. She'll think it's the ghosts. It'll work. We'll pay her back. It's always worked when we've attacked the other houses. That was with other kids. Look, we'll do the trick, and we'll get the hell out of here, right? - Alright, let's do it. - Alright! Come on! Alright. Queenie, you're over there. Jon-Jon, over here. You, over here. When I say "now", just go for it, alright? We know what we're doing? Alright, let's go. Oh! Oh! Please! Please! Argh! Let our souls free! We've come back! - Let's go back to the swamp! - Whip it! Whip it good! I have to give it to you, dickens, you sure came up with a good one tonight. Great idea! We're not out of here yet. What could go wrong? We've got it made! Watch out! You ok? - Are you ok? - Are you hurt? - Is he alright? - I don't know. - Are you alright? - What a dick! Answer me. Whip it! Fuck! Hello! Ding-dong! Anybody home? Are you sure you're ok? Ugh! Somebody's here. Come on, let's get out of here. Brooke? Brooke! What are you doing? - They're here. - Who? - They're here. - What's happened to you? They've come back. - Are you alright? - They were... - They were here. - Who? Who? Look, look, I didn't see anybody outside. Come on, come on. Look, I'll go out and look, alright? Alright? I'll take a look. There's nobody out there now. Alright? Ok? They were there. They've come to get me. Oh, damn! It's happening... all over again. No! Look, it's probably just... It's probably just some kids pulling a prank to get even with the teacher. - It happens all the time. - I... I never should've... Oh, come on, Brooke. Look, there's nobody out there now. It's alright. Help me. Oh, Brooke, nobody's gonna hurt you. Come on, let's get you up to bed. You think dickens got caught? He was right next to me in the woods. I was running, and all of a sudden he was gone. Idiot! What's he trying to prove? He's caught, and we all get nailed. Why didn't he leave the keys in the car? He's a dick, that's why. 'There! You look much better. 'Oh, here.' take this. It's gonna calm you down enough to get you through the night. Oh, don't worry, it's not gonna hurt you. It just a quaalude. Kids take 'em all the time. Come on. Yes. Yes, take it. Come on. 'Good. 'Really. It's really gonna help you sleep. 'See? You're gonna sleep like a baby.' listen, I'll come back in the morning and check up on you, alright? 'Believe me, everything's gonna be fine.' you'll see. That was coach hand's car. The girls' swimming coach? - Isn't she kinky? - She sure likes to watch the girls undress. That miss storm is a real weird old lady. I never saw anybody freak out like she did. Weird. Really weird. - What could dickens be doing? - You never know with him, eh? - He's probably just fucking with us. - Sometimes...! - Sometimes what? - Nothing. Queenie, would you go up there and get that fucking idiot? - Why me? - Because you can reason with the jerk off. - You can handle dickens. - Oh, that's bullshit. - But I take it you guys don't wanna go. - You got it. He's out there. He'll leap out of the dark, throw me down on the ground, doing his old sex thing. Would you just go up there? We could be wasting time. - She could've called the police. - Yeah. Ok. Queenie, take your mask. We don't take any chances, ok? Yeah. I'll bring dickens back. No telling what that dickens is up to. Ugh! Please... "Please"? "Please"? Please what? I'll tell you about "please". I'll tell you about "please". "Please" is a word that's begging for it! Why do you hide your body? I know... I know what you got, and I... I know what you got. In my class, there's only one test. You dig? - I know what you got. - What do you think you're doing? She's passed out, you goddamn animal. What do you think you're doing? When are you gonna learn that "scare them into giving up" bullshit doesn't work? - This is none of your fucking business. - Idiot! Go to hell! All you know how to do is tease. Oh, your rape mentality! Watch this and learn something. See how it's done? It's easy. Do you like it? Do you like it? Do you like it? Touch her. Touch her. Feels good this way. Does it feel good to you, dickens? Do you like it this way? Yeah, you like it. Idiot! - You'll never learn, you retard! - I'm gonna nail this bitch. No, you're not. Now, come on, let's get out of here. - Who's gonna stop me? - I am. What? He's gonna stop your ass. Come on, this isn't funny. Shut up! This is between me and the football hero. - I'm gonna finish this. - Look, you'd better not. - Let's get out of here while we still can. - No. You're pushing our luck. She's had enough! - I said I'm gonna finish it. - It's no good, man. What do you owe her? Look, there are limits. There are certain laws we can't break. This is real trouble, real jail. Our future. You're just a coward. Maybe so. Ugh! Champ is tiring! Why are you doing this? She's part of that system. - I told you, limits! - Fuck the limits. Give it up, man. - Let's call it a night and go home. - Help me! - Look, it's over. - Queenie, you see what's happening. - Help me! - Give it up! Oh, shit! Savage! - She's hurt bad. - Check her. Smiler, check her! There went my future. - Hey, what can we do if she's...? - Get the hell out of here. That crazy bitch! She really went for it. Well? Well, how bad is it? We're in for it. Well, what's the verdict? She's dead! Oh, Christ! - Let's just get out of here. - The keys, the keys. - What about smiler? - He'll have to make it on his own. I don't fucking believe this! - Fuck! - She's dead. Let's just get the fuck out of here, right? Come on, get in! - Come on! - Ugh, come on! - Everything's out of tune! - You sure she was dead? - Yeah, she was dead. - Shit! She got what she deserved. She was crazy. One fucking mistake, I blew my whole life. Next time, dickens... It was you, dickens. It was you that set her off. Hey, we're all in this together. Hey, stop the car. Stop the car now! Just listen. Look, we can't run away like this and hope nothing happens, hope that nobody finds out that we did it. - What else can we do? - Nobody saw us. Can you be sure? Do you know that? Don't forget, coach hand was there, and there's no telling what miss storm might've told her. We gotta improve our odds. We gotta stop listening to you. No, we gotta find somebody to stick the blame on, let somebody else spend time in jail. - Who? - The quarterback. Who else? - It'll never work. - It will work! Look, the football hero, he's a loser. He's too stupid. We find something that belongs to the quarterback, we plant it in miss storm's house, and when the cops find it, they can stick the blame on him. - I can't stand up to the quarterback. - I'm not going. Oh, no, we're gonna send the toughest son of a bitch that we got. - That's you. - No. - It's Jon-Jon. - No way, dickens. Hey, you beat the shit out of me. So, now, tough guy, we can find out just how good you really are. You're crazy. Hey, you're our only chance to stay out of prison. Oh, and they'd love you at the penitentiary. The team should be at the diner by now. We always go there after the games. Quarterback will be there. Jon-Jon, take the car, and find solid proof that the quarterback was at miss storm's tonight. What if I get caught? Then we're all fucked. Good luck! - Come on, let's get back to the house. - We went too far. We always go too far! Time. Let's make some time. J“ you're not far behind the dinosaur j“ dinosaur j“ you should not exist j“ for the likes of you are disappearing j“ for I'm the ending to this j“ I thought girls like you were gone forever j“ you're one of a rarer kind j“ there's not many left like you j“ who knows what really matters? J“ there's not many left like you - j“ oh, you do it alright - j“ do it alright j“ there's not many left like you j“ so, I'm gonna keep it secret j“ there's not many left... j“ son of a bitch... J“ there's not many left like you j“ who knows what really matters? J“ there's not many left like you - j“ oh, you do it alright - j“ do it alright j“ there's not many left like you j“ so, I'll only keep you... j“ Dickens' car, man, look! That is dickens' car. Christ, my tire! Come on, let's take my bike. Not now, alright? Let's go! Fingerprints! I forgot fingerprints! What did I touch? If Jon-Jon doesn't make it, I'm running away. Mexico, maybe. What's in Mexico? Mexicans. Jon-Jon'll make it. If he doesn't, it's Mexico for me. We'll never get out of the state. You don't think so? - Not a chance. - What can we do? It's the slammer. Not for me! You'll be the first one they catch. Fucking settle down! I'm worried, man! - Eat a hot dog! - How can you be hungry? - I didn't kill her. - Yeah? You made it happen. No, you killed her, queenie. You should've stopped Jon-Jon, and I would never have let her get out of that window. Yeah, you would've raped her! Yeah, I would've given her something. I would've paid her back for all that shit that she's been giving me. Yeah, you got a fucking problem. The boy knows he's got a problem. The same one we all got. No, my problem isn't your problem. What's the idea? Don't give me shit, smiler, cos I don't take it from you. I wasn't giving you shit! Jon-Jon has to make it and get us out of this! - How long? - Not long. - Well... - Not long! Fucking f! That whore. Do you believe that? Queenie, do you have to do that? Yes, I do. Yeah? Get the fuck out. I don't want to hear about it. You macho ass! I'm going, man! Women sure got your number, dickens. That's bullshit! Is it? Help me! Help me, please! I need help. I need help. Come and help me. You're ok! This is great. I've got to tell the others. I'll get you to a hospital. I won't let that idiot dickens hurt you anymore. It's a miracle. Come on, let's... Did you hear that? What? I thought I heard a noise outside. We're falling apart here. At least that bitch miss storm won't give us any more trouble. She finally got what she deserved. He didn't make it. - He'll make it. - He'd be back by now. Whatever happened, any bitching ain't gonna help it. We're not gonna get out of this. Sure is dark out there. Tell me something I don't know. - What the hell is wrong with you? - Everything! I should've stayed home tonight. Now it's crying time again. We'll be fine. I should never have gone to the swamp. And coming here was the worst. You know, that football hero Jon-Jon, he ain't so tough. Too many mistakes! He's a fool. Jon-Jon didn't make it. Fucking dickens! I'm gonna kill! Where's queenie? She's smart. She got out. My mother told me there'd be days like this. I'm gonna find queenie. What do you think? About what? What I should do. I'm gonna get a marine haircut. That's what I'll do when this is over. I can't live like this, you know? Oh, you can't? This is not a good time for me. I can't live like this. So, now you know. Yeah, I knew that all the time. No... Don't do it. Don't go inside... the house. Come with me. Something's happened. Hurry! Come on. Yes, that's right, come on. Yes! Yes! Go! We'll be safe! Come on! Come on! Queenie? Queenie? Is that you? Queenie, what's happened? Queenie, what's going on? Where are smiler and dickens? Queenie? Queenie? Oh, god! Where's the queen machine? Who cares? I'm going out to the road to see if I can see Jon-Jon. Yeah, you do that. It'll do me good to get away from you. Hey, you made it! Hey, Jon-Jon! Aces! Jon-Jon? Jon-Jon? Where are you, man? Jon-Jon, where are you? Jon-Jon? Where are you, man? We've been waiting for you. Hey, where are you, man? Get me the hell out of here! - We gotta get out of here. - What happened? - The car's back. - The car's back? - Yeah, but no sign of Jon-Jon. - So, where's Jon-Jon? He's missing in action. He isn't around! What are they trying to pull? Come on, we gotta get out of here. It's gotta be the quarterback. He must've caught up with Jon-Jon and made him bring him back here. Hey, you might be right. - Let's get going! - Just stop! Slow down a minute and think. You know, somebody scared Jon-Jon away from the house. Yeah. Someone's out there. - Come on, let's get going! - Just slow down! I think I'm gonna be sick. Where's the bathroom? It's upstairs. Smiler! Come on! 'You never should've come back. 'I didn't want you to come back. 'I want you to go away. 'I want you to go away forever.' - J“ all day, all day... j“ - Miss storm, please! Please! - J“ always, always... j“ - it was Jon-Jon's idea. I'm sorry. Please, miss storm. It was a game. It was a game, miss storm. You never should've hurt my Dolly. "Dolly"? What do”? Please, miss storm. Please. Please! Please! Please! You should've stayed dead in the swamp where I left you. Oh, my god! The swamp legend. You... Argh! Jon-Jon, get me down. - What the hell's going on, man? - She's the one.
