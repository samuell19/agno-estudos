[ man screams ] [ dog barks ] Donna! I'm coming! [ bulbs cracking ] Donna! John-- [ gasps ] Johnny? Good, that's good! Just stand up! I can't do this! You can! We're almost out of time! Ah! I can't! You can! Just don't think about it! Come on, Johnny! Just stand up! [ crying ] I can't move! You're doing great! Just stand up! You got this! Good! Just focus on the grass! Come on, Johnny! Jump! Johnny? Johnny! [ screams ] No, Johnny! [ crying ] [voice] Donna. [ scraping, sloshing ] [ whimpers ] Please, God. [ crying ] [ whimpering ] [ screams ] [Girl] Seriously, babe, where the hell are we going? [Boy] We are going north. [ laughs ] It's Carter's annual Halloween scare venture, whatever you want to call it. So just enjoy the mystery. Oh, okay, cool. Hopefully, it's better than last year's "scary" corn maze. Yeah, I hope Luke doesn't break any more bones this year. Well, he did get like a jillion hits on that video, though. Yeah, but he missed the playoffs. True, but, man, can Luke scream or what? Oh, so you like it when they scream. Okay, I will jump out of this moving vehicle right now if this sexcapade goes any further. Are you jealous? Hey, you should have invited... shit, what's his face? Yeah, when your friends refer to your on-again-mostly-off whatever he is as "what's his face", it's usually a safe bet that the relationship isn't gonna work out. He's out there, Mad. Yeah. What exactly do your friends know about me? Well, they know that you're a great lay. Luke, you're a shit! Well, you are. You're such an ass. You are a great lay! You want me to lie to my friends, is that what? I hate you. [ chuckles ] Well, they know your name, they know you're a little bit shy. They know that you're into pitchers. Pitchers of beer. Ah, right. Not baseball pitchers, no. No. They're well aware of your alcoholism. Yeah, I'm not into you... at all. They know that you maybe stalked me after one of my games. It was one time, let it go. Well, you did do it. Look, they're my friends. They're gonna love you. Okay. ♪ Kill the D.J. ♪ ♪ Gotta help me ♪ ♪ Kill the D.J. ♪ ♪ Got to got to make him pay ♪ ♪ So let's kill ♪ ♪ Kill the D.J. ♪ Welcome, my pretties! Ooh, Addison! Me-ow! What do you expect? You say Halloween and party. I hear costume. [ chuckles ] And cats have really good hearing. Yeah, well, the camera's loving kitties. Oh, you must be the stalker. Hi. I'm Holt. The stalker. So Luke's told you. I'm also vegan, so I might as well put that out there now. Oh, I'm not a vegan. This bag is full of meat. Oh! I like meat. And? M'lady. There you go. Hey. I'm Maddie. Hi. Alex. Hey, Carter, can I ask you a question? Why did you bring us to your grandma's ghetto-ass house? [ chuckles ] That's funny. That's the same thing your mom asks me every time she brings me here for some one-on-one. Ew. Who wants to see what's inside? Come on, let's check it out. Eh? Listen, Doc, I've had like this clicking in my wrist... Do you think I'm in med school to be your personal physician? Unless you're a hot chick that needs something checked out, it's a hard pass. Hey, but man to man, use the other hand. Use the other hand... Come on. Tell me this place isn't prime! Right. [ laughs ] Well, happy Halloween! Courtesy of your neighborhood serial killer. Where did you bring us? Carter, when you said overnight, I think we expected something a little less, uh... Sad? Desolate? Tragic?Tragic? [ laughs ] Ah, the power of besties. See? Now, I just thought that was the power of you two regressing to the second grade again and again and again and again. Dude, what are we doing here? Whoa! Seriously? Oh, okay, all right. No. Hey, babe, sure you don't want to go to a hotel? No! Come on. Guys, it'll be fun. We're here to explore. Look for ghosts, channel spirits, whatever. Look, it's the perfect pre-Halloween, Halloween thing to do. I mean, it's a total dead and breakfast. [ chuckles ] No. Absolutely not. All right, picture it. This place, 1983. Right here in this house, seven teenagers played [ strikes piano keys ] Truth or Dare. God, the 80s really were tragic, weren't they? You know what, Holt? They were. Because all but one of them died horrible, painful deaths. Wait. In this house? Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Can't you feel it? You guys, overnight this place became a haunted house. The people moved away. The neighborhood started dying. This place has a power. Yeah, okay. Let's hope it has real power. [ chuckles ] Okay, okay, wait. What about the person who survived? Points to Alex for paying attention. She was never seen since. But rumor has it if you did see her, her face would haunt you forever. Aah! [ laughing ] So dumb. Dude, get to the part where you stop boring us already. All right. Saddle up. We're gonna find out once and for all if things really do go bump in the night. I was afraid you'd say that. Babe, are you sure you want to stay here? It's one night in Carter's houseofhorror.lame. We got this. Ahh!Oh! [ laughing ] Do we? All right, let's unload, and then we begin. [ wind blowing ] When millennials freeze up in front of the camera when all they do is take selfies all day. You really weren't kidding. You're gonna videotape everything tonight? Yeah. Carter here is the founding member... The only member. Of the film club, or whatever it is that you do by yourself. Don't need to know what he does by himself, thank you. Ah, but, sweets, you're with me in spirit every second I'm doing it. Lucky me. Read between the lines. You know what, I actually kind of think it's cool. Here, I got you a beer. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, my God! It's dead! Ugh, so disgusting. Isn't that against veggie law? I mean, roaches are people too. They are not people. They are vile creatures and they can eat me. Tempting. All right, we're roach-free. Now what? Now... wait for it. We play the game. Truth or Dare! [ clock chimes ] That was weird. How'd you pull that one off, Carter? Who cares? I want to do a séance. Like engage with the other side, the afterlife. Well, Addie, good thing I stuffed a Ouija Board down my pants before we left. O-M-G! And then we can talk about how cute Tyler is, and totally braid each other's hair. All right, all right, all right. But come on. Think about it. How cool it would be to play that game in this house where all hell broke loose? You mean, where all those people died? I'm in! But I'm not doing anything sexual. Ditto. Boo... #Keepitclean, boys. Fine. Nothing sexual. Oh, we promise. You know what? Nothing illegal. Cause, um, the rental's in my name. All right. I got some cards and I got some pens. We'll write down some dares and truths and we'll mix them up. All right. Hand it over. [ chattering ] Thanks. Ladies first. Know what? I'm feeling feisty. Ease up, babe! Really, boys? Did we not just go over this? "Make out with Maddie." [ laughs ] Who would... That's crazy! You should probably do that one, though. This should be interesting. Come on. She's your "bestie", remember? It'll be like kissing your sister. No. That's totally not a thing, ew. Not the same thing at all. Make out, make out, make out... Okay, Maddie, pucker up. Hoo-hoo-hoo! Oh, yes! [ laughs ] Yeah, I am definitely pregnant after that. All right, all right, I'll go next. Let's see who else you guys want me to kiss. Well? I'm not playing. [Carter] That's not the rules. No quitsies. Do the card. Come on... I'm not playing the card. Stop touching me. Aw, geez! Stop! Give it back! I said stop! You guys, stop it! "Did you sleep with Tyler"? Oh. I did not have sexual relations... Shut up, Holt! Damn. I didn't sleep with Tyler. [ cell phones chime ] Awkward. I can't do this anymore. Um... I made a mistake. When you were away with your family, Tyler and I got drunk and we hooked up. But it didn't mean anything. It meant nothing. But, Alex, you're my best friend. I'm so sorry. Alex? Babe, wait. Alex? Whoever wrote that is dead. Carter, you are such an asshole! Intense! Shot? Shot? Shot? Everybody. Babe, just please let me explain. Like I want details? Don't, seriously, Tyler. Alex, just please listen to me, all right? Get away from me! Who did you tell? I never said a word. I want to know who the hell did this. Ty, look, none of us knew. Seriously? Yeah, that's messed up, bro. [ clock chimes ] I didn't write that! That's not even my handwriting. I'm not doing it! I don't want to be in any more of dumbass videos! What the hell? Dude, grow the hell up. [ crackling ] [ screams ] God! Help! Help! Tyler! What happened? Get my medic pack from the car! Okay. [ shouts ] What's going on? Oh my God, what happened? What did you do? It wasn't me. What do you mean?It wasn't me! Just bring that around. Around this side. There we go. Okay. You, you set this whole freak show up! He's right. You're the one that wanted to go viral. You know what? Suck it, newbie. You don't know me and you don't know Tyler! Maybe you slept with him too. Carter!That's enough. I'm not making this shit up. Okay, I'm drunk, but I am not that drunk. [voice] Three rounds. 48 hours or you die. Die? What does it say? Eat Tyler's burnt flesh. [ static ] [ clock chimes ] Four? Four minutes. Son of a bitch! You play your shitty pranks on the rest of us, but you leave her out of it! How many times do I have to say that I am not behind it! All I did was rent this house! All right, I wanted us to have fun. Have a few drinks, whatever. Haunted house, great! If I caught something on camera, bonus. I did not write that card. And I did not set up any tricks. Jesus! I would never hurt anybody! Oh, yeah? Last year was an accident and you know that. Yeah, well, we're outta here. Let's grab your stuff. Guys... [ shrieks ] [Alex] What was that? [ doors slam ] Whoa! Ah! It's trapping us!How? Go around! Come on! The windows! The windows! Try to break the windows! Ugh! Oh, my God! Are you okay? No! No, no, no, no! What? Oh, my gosh... [ shouting ] Oh my gosh, come on, try the doors! [ screaming ] We gotta do the dare. The dare... Everybody shut up! What? I think you gotta do the dare. What? No. I had two minutes and I didn't do it. Look, I know this is nuts, but I think Ty is right. I think you gotta do your card, Jess. Screw you! He's right! I am not doing it! [ door creaks ] Somebody do something. Oh, my God, you guys. We're wasting time here. I mean, she had four minutes. Ty's card said two. And then he got hurt because... Because I didn't do the dare. The dare did me. Jessie, you have to do it. You only have a couple of minutes left. Come on! We have to do something! Check your phones! Come on! Calls! Just check! Shit. No signal. Mine's not working either. There's no signal! It's no use! Jessie, come on! No, no, I can't! This could be our way out! Let go! No! No, no, no. Hey, Jess, Look, look at me. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, we're not sure what's going on. But something is happening here and we have to handle it. That means you, Jessie and it means right now, okay? Okay, I know that this is crazy. But we gotta do this, okay? I'm right there with you. Come on. Okay. Come on! Okay. One minute! Okay. I can't do it. I can't do it... Oh, shit! [ crying ] Guys, we're running out of time. No. [ gags ] It's over. [ telephone ringing ] Answer it! What is it? All of it. No, I can't. I can't do it. [ crying ] Do it! You have to. [ overlapping dialogue ] Hurry! Okay! Okay, I did it. [ crying ] There has to be a way out of here. I'll check upstairs! Damn it! Holt! Go, go, go, go, go! There's nothing upstairs. [ piano plays ] We have to play three rounds. Alex, no.Well, maybe you can sleep with it. We'll all be home free. That's not fair. Not fair? I think it's pretty clear. We do the dare, we live. We don't... Well, who hasn't gone? You, Holt, Luke and Addie. I can't. I'm not doing it. Nobody wants to. This is ridiculous! What aren't you guys getting? Come on. Why don't you step up, babe? Step off it, Luke!Okay, just shut up! Okay, I'll do it! I'll do it. You happy? I'll do it! Fine! "Grab the wires." What the hell does that mean? Grab the-- [ clock chimes ] [voice] One minute. [ whimpering ] Carter, grab that blanket over there. What? Grab that blanket. Hey, Holt? Hey, pay attention. All right? Calm down, pay attention. Now I'm not gonna lie. It's gonna hurt. You might not be able to let go. Carter, you're gonna hold the blanket. You're gonna run as fast as you can towards Holt. Why me? Carter, just shut up! All right, just do it. Holt, now whenever he gets to you, I want you to grab the wires. Carter will slam into you and knock you from the circuit. Now if this works... If? It should. It should what? It should what? Keep you alive. That's a big if. It's all we got. That's a big if.It's all we got. Carter, man, you gotta be fast. You gotta be real fast. Okay. Well, good thing my buddy Carter's all-state track, right? He wasn't all anything. No, he's not all... I'm just trying to lighten the mood, okay? Holt, you ready? Yeah, as ready as I'm gonna be. Okay, Carter, here we go. Wait! Wait! Take off your watch! Take off your watch! Shit, yeah, she's right. Take off anything metal that can heat up and burn. Here, here. There's metal. Okay. All right, Carter, go. No, just go! Is he okay? What's happening? Is he alive? [ coughing ] Oh my God. It's okay. Take this. I can't. I can't do it. It's okay. Ow! I'm going nuts. This is completely crazy! Hey. Hey, hey, hey. It's insane! No, no, no! Hello? I just ate a person's skin! Calm down! You're not helping! Like you would know! You've answered one question! You haven't done shit! Holt just got electrocuted! I'm done! Okay, enough is enough, all right? Ghost, spirit, monster, I don't give a damn! I'm done playing its stupid game! Pay attention, guys. You do the dare... [ creaks ] Or the dare does you. [ rattling ] Two minutes. We have two minutes. Luke, two minutes. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! This, this is my scholarship we're talking about, guys! Scouts are coming! This is my shot! We can't just smash my knee... You're not gonna be able to play anything if you're dead! Okay, then we'll wait it out. See what happens! Luke... Babe... You have to. God, okay! Fine, fine, fine! Just do it! Just do it! [Alex] You got this, Luke. What do I do? What do I do? Just hit it! You can do it! Come on! Oh! Okay, it's done. We did it. Oh, shit. You're running out of time! I just did it, though! Screw that! You're not smashing my knee! What are you doing? [ screams ] I'm sorry. I'm sorry!You okay? Sorry! I'm sorry!Are you okay? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. No, I can't do this anymore! Addison, just try to calm down! Addison? Don't tell me to calm down or relax! Don't tell me to do anything! I wont do this anymore. I can't. "Are you an addict?" No! Addie, you're on drugs? I'm not an addict! You have to tell the truth. I don't have to do shit, okay? No, Addison, listen please... Carter, shut up! Like I'm not a drug addict! I got in a car accident, remember? I took painkillers and they're prescribed. Jesus, why do I have to explain this to you? It's not the question. Believe me, don't believe me. I don't give a shit. Listen to a voice, a phone, a damn door? You know what? This whole little squad? I'm so done. [ phone chimes ] [Tyler] Wait, wait, Addie! [Alex] Addison! Addison, wait! Addie! Stop! Addie, don't go!Just listen! Addie, you can't go! Addison! You can't leave! Have fun and good luck, bitches. [Alex] Just come back inside! Addie, wait! [ door creaks ] [ wind blows ] Addie! [ panting ] I've told you the same story over and over again, and there are seven other people. Let me get this straight. Just back up from the beginning. You rented this house, you had your friends over. Mm-hmm. And... mystery things started happening? Like a ghost? What was it? What, you think we're all lying? Because it just doesn't add up. I mean, you guys taking drugs? Doesn't it seem strange to you? Doc says I'm all good. What's taking Carter so long? What's taking Carter so long, is trying to explain something that can't be explained to a bunch of idiot police who'd rather be knee deep in jelly-filled doughnuts than listen to me. What about Tyler and Holt? For God's sake, Addison is dead. What do you mean, they're not listening to you? They are... gonna rule it an accident. They're calling everything that happened an accident? [Holt] Yeah. Makes sense, doesn't it? Think about it. A game of Truth or Dare gone bad. That sounds legit. A game of Truth or Dare with some evil-ass presence or whatever? Come on, who's gonna believe that? So that's it? They're just not gonna do anything? They're saying that we were drunk, which we were. Things got out of control. To them, the whole thing spells stupid college kids plus booze equals problems. Hell of a lot easier for their tiny brains to understand than inexplicable evil. What about the video? Did you show them? The video, yeah, about that. Take a look. What? [ static ] Great. This is great. I wish they could have seen that video. Yeah, no shit. Enough, all right? It's not my fault your stupid camera didn't catch anything. Do you think that's what I care about it? Screw you. Okay, stop it! Just stop! God, we're all tired. We're all a mess. Let's just move forward. Ah, really have some nerve, Maddie. Move on? Tell that to Addison. Excuse me? All right, I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. I'm just-- I'm so tired. I don't even know what to say. All right, everyone just go home. Get some sleep. Someone's gonna need to talk to Addison's parents. Yeah, who? I guess I can call her sister. I mean, I knew her parent-- I know her parents. This sucks. Well, we're never going back to that house. Yeah, okay. Alex? I'm coming with you, Carter. You awake? Yeah, me too. I keep thinking about how lucky we are... that we didn't... I can't believe Addison is... She's a good person. Like a really good person. Yeah, Maddie. She was. It was late. And we were both really drunk. Stop, stop. Alex? This is pathetic. Okay, look, you have every right to be mad at me. But at least... Yeah, I do. And I'm sorry. Like more sorry than you'll ever understand. And I don't know how many times I need to keep saying it. But I really am! Okay, I just want things to go back to normal. Normal? Okay, yeah, great. Let's just turn back the clocks and all will be normal again. We'd still be best friends... And Addison would still be alive. I'm really sorry. Yeah, we covered that. I made a mistake! [ Addison laughing ] [Carter] Would you rather never see your family again or have to live with them for the rest of your life? Have to live with them for the rest of my life because we live on a really big property. [Carter] Would you rather... Addie? How long have you been in love with me? Carter? Hang yourself for two minutes. You're not done yet. No, we beat you! You have one minute. No, no! Help! Help! No. You can beat it. Help! Help! Please help! Help! Oh, come on, Carter. Time's up. Help! Help! Help! Please help! No, no! [ choking ] [ cell phone buzzes ] It's got Carter! What?Come on! [ choking, pounding on door ] Oh, my God! Maddie, come on! Carter! Carter! Carter! Hey, Carter! Hey, let us in, Carter! Together! Carter! Carter! [ screaming ] [ panting ] [ police radio chatter ] How many ways do these cops want us to say the same thing? It's what they understand. They ruling it a suicide. Did you hear he hung himself? I heard it was an accident. Hey, no. He didn't hang himself. And it wasn't an accident. He was murdered! Hey, Alex, Alex, come on. Seriously? Come on? Two of our friends are dead! When is this nightmare gonna end? Alex... You okay? Hey, guys, have you talked to Luke or Jessie? They know about Carter? Yeah, they know. I called them. They've been holed up in his room. I looked up a bunch of stuff in the house and all those stories Carter told us are true. The deaths, the survivor. Wasn't much, but it's all true. Then we should go back to the cops. Listen to this. "Police say they have no evidence of foul play in the death of six youths, all locals. The events have officially been ruled accidents or suicides. But one investigator who spoke anonymously said they believe the events to be related to a death pact amongst the group. The only survivor has negated that assertion and refused further comment." A death pact? Well, they got the death part right. But, come on, how could they think it was an accident? Okay, fine. So then what? What do we do? Are we just screwed? Maybe not. Where are you going? We're going to talk to the lady who survived this 30 years ago. Who the hell is she? We're about to find out. What's her name again?Donna Boone. And you're positive she lives here? [ doorbell rings ] Donna Boone? Maybe she's not home. [ knocking on window ] Donna? It has to be her. Donna Boone? We've been to the Charun House. We played the game and now our friends are dying. Please help us! Maybe there's another way. We don't have time. Come on. [ ringing doorbell ] You're right. There is no other way. And you don't have time. Come on. Please sit down. It started as a Christmas game. They called it "Questions and Commands". It went back as far as 1712. If someone didn't answer a question or lied, they had to pay a price. A dare, if you will. What does that have to do with us? Oh, God, you guys look just like my friends. It was such an innocent game. Here. It ended up not so innocent. It's that house, isn't it? Oh, if it was, I would have burned it to the ground myself. No, that's just where we played the game. You know, that thing, that darkness isn't relegated to any one place. Evil never is. So what is it? God, it's, um... it's powerful. It's a demon that feeds on your fear and your pain and the secrets. It uses the game to steal its victim's souls and makes it look like an accident or a suicide. So you know? Yeah. I saw it on the news. It's a tragedy for people not involved but a murder for those who are. We tried going to the police, but... Yeah, I did too. It landed me in an institution for 10 years. Yeah, I'm afraid you're on your own. Well, then we'll leave town. No. That's not the way it works. You played the game. You opened the door. It chose you. And if I could tell you why, then maybe my friends would still be here with me. But they lost. So what now? What do we do? Three rounds. 48 hours. You finish the game, but you can beat it. I did. How? Please tell us how. Well, you have to help each other as much as you can. You have to be smart. You have to share the dares. What does that mean? Well, for instance, one of mine was I had to make four deep cuts. I knew I would bleed to death if I did that. So I did one and my friends took the other three. And I walked away hurt, but alive. The dare was done. This sounds crazy. Think about it, we've already done that. Hey, Holt, Carter helped you when you had to grab the wires. That's true. Well, what about you? You know, what happened to your face? And why didn't you share the dare? There was nobody left but me. It was the third round, my final dare. This is only in the second round. Yeah, then things are gonna get a lot worse. Just go back to the house. That's where it started and that's where it has to end. But just remember, you can be smarter than the game. You okay? [ sighs ] I'm gonna go take a shower. I'm gonna turn my phone on if you want to talk. [ gasps ] What? What's wrong? Oh, my God. We got to go! We got to go right now! It's a dare. Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Don't. What? You can't! You can't do this one!I don't have a choice! Come on. [ tires squealing ] Wait, wait, wait. Please don't go, please. Okay, look. Just stay in the car, okay? Don't get out. Anything happens, just be ready to leave, okay? I'll be right with you. I need you to give me some money. Any amount. It doesn't matter. I don't have time to explain. But, please, I just need you to give me something. Look, lady, I'm not gonna shoot you, I promise. But I need you to give me some money! Oh! All right! Now! Right now! I need it. Okay! Faster! Come on! Drop it! Look... Please, you don't understand! I can't argue with you! I don't have any time to... I will shoot! Just give me some money! Anything! A dollar! Doesn't matter! Please! Ah! [ gunshot ] [ crying ] Come on, pick up, pick up. Pick up. Alex! Alex! [ crying ] No, everything is not okay! Luke's dead, Luke's dead. Luke's dead. It found us in his dorm. Jessie! And it said that he had to go rob a gas station. And he got shot. I don't know what to do! Look, I think I figured out what we have to do. We need to go back to the house, okay? What? No! No, I'm not going back to that damn house! I'm not going! I just can't! No, no, no, trust me, okay? We have to finish the game. Otherwise, we're all going to die. I don't understand. Why? Just hurry up and...Jessie? Jessie? Hello? Shit! Shit! I'm so sorry. It's okay. Come here. We're gonna figure this out, okay? [ gasps ] I think I know how to end it. Come on. [ buzzing ] So now what? Next time, don't ask. Now or never, right? "Drink the liquid." What liquid? [ clock chimes ] Two minutes. There. It's poison. Can you tell what kind? No. Great. So now what? We do what Donna said. We share the dare. It said to drink, but not that he had to it by himself. Are you sure? I don't know. I don't want to do this one. I really don't. News flash, you guys. Jessie doesn't want to do this. You know what, Holt? You don't always have to be an asshole. Come on, guys, enough. We do the dare. We work together. We survive. Well, what if it kills us? Exactly. What are you doing? We can do this. If we drink the soda, the phosphoric acid will protect the lining of our stomach. At least long enough to puke the stuff back up. It's med school 101. You're the only doctor here so I'm gonna believe whatever you say. Okay, give me those. Ready? Yeah. We're wasting time. Always. [ cans opening ] All right, okay, on the count of three, we're gonna drink the soda. You're gonna feel bloated at first, but it'll help get the shit back up faster. Are we ready? One, two, three. Ugh. [ groaning ] [ belches ] Everyone take one of these. Okay, on the count of three, drink and then get it out of your body, all right? One, two, three. [ retching ] [ scraping ] Oh, shit! [ metallic squeaking ] She's in here. Come on. Oh, hell, no. [ clock chimes ] You guys are gonna help me, right? Yeah. We're in this together. It says two teeth. Two. Oh, shit, here we go! Then we'll choose. What? No! What? Are we gonna get straws and just pick... Just shut up, Holt! There's four of you. Figure it out. No! That's not fair! That's not fair! We share the dare, remember? Just share the damn dare, okay? I wasn't even supposed to be here! I was supposed to be with Luke wherever the hell else instead of getting dragged into this shit! Fine, you're out. What? Are you kidding me? That's... Fine! I'll do the dare, okay? I'll do it. No. I'll do it. I'll do the pulling if you're okay with that. You're the doc. Okay. All right. Okay, all right. A back upper molar, okay? Gravity will help and it won't be noticeable. You ready? No. [ squeals ] [ whimpers ] It's okay, it's okay. You're done, you're done. Oh! You're done, you're done, you're done. It's okay. Hey, Holt, here we go. Aw, come on. Okay. All right, I'll be gentle, you know. Don't worry. It's not like I'm holding a grudge that you stole Becky G. from me at the seventh grade dance. You can have her. All right, you're gonna grab, twist and pull fast, all right? Okay.

And I need to tell you guys something. Two years ago, I was involved in something. I was involved in a hit-and-run. And I got freaked out and I left the scene of the crime because I was afraid my parents were gonna like get mad at me. And they were gonna yank me out of college. And the guy that I hit, he got paralyzed. Okay, you got a truth. It's okay. No, I didn't get a truth. So why are you telling us this for? 'Cause I need someone to run me over in less than two minutes! What? Hey, Alex? I need you to snap out of this for me, okay? I need you to snap out of this. Holt, come on! We have to go. Come on!

Now I know what Donna meant. Holt ran someone over. You and Tyler cheated. Carter was a voyeur. Addison was an addict. Luke was obsessed with sports and winning. His entire life hinged on his ability to play. I don't get it. So what? It's punishing us for our secrets, our obsessions, our sins. But why us? Why? What did we do? What did we do? Donna said it. We opened the door. It... Maybe it knew we were weak, easy prey. Maybe we deserved it. Maybe.I don't get it. Because I don't have any weaknesses or fears or whatever. [Alex] We all do. Some of us are just better at hiding them. Oh, yeah? So then what? What's yours? [voice] Jessie.
