I can't feel anything? I can't move, I can't speak, and I can't open my eyes. [in Taglish] Where am I? Shit! What's this? [in Mandarin] [woman in Tagalog] Why does he look like that? What's his status, Doc? [doctor] We're still observing him, Mrs. -[woman] Elton. -[man] Chona. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog, Chinese accent] My make-up's not finished. [in Mandarin] I'm still dressed. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] He might be turned off if I don't have good make-up. [in Taglish] He doesn't have a choice, this is an arranged marriage. [in Tagalog] Come now, change clothes now. [soft singing] [in English] Your order, sir? -Please give us the house wine. -[in English] Yes, sir. [singing continues] [in Mandarin] [laughing] [singing continues] [in English] Aquarium, um, Aquarius. [giggles] [in English] Um, Scorpio. [laughing] [in Mandarin] -[in English] Snake. -[in English] Ah, Rabbit. [laughing] -[in Tagalog] I graduated from St. Jude. -Me, ICA. [laughing] [in Tagalog] Is our marriage going through? That's what they said. Who are they? My parents and your parents. Do you want to? Um, it's okay. You're pretty, anyway. [laughs] [Chona, in thought] Pretty anyway? Anyway! It's like this bastard doesn't want to compliment me. [oriental music playing] -What kind of foolishness is that? -[squeals] [screams] Hey, why? [screaming] We're married now. We've known each other for only just one month. We're husband and wife now. But it's still new, right now. Yes, right now. But this will be till our old age. [in Mandarin] [sneezes] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Cornstarch. Cornstarch? For what? [in Taglish] I'm allergic to other people. [in Tagalog] If I have close contact with others, I'll… -have breakouts. -You mean… you mean every time we'll sleep together, you'll put on cornstarch? Yes, I can use flour too. [sneezes] I'm actually allergic to cornstarch. -What's this? -Lime. -For what? -To whiten this and the groin. [in Mandarin] [in Taglish] I also ordered papaya and cucumber. [in Tagalog] What are those for? Elton. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog, Chinese accent] I have many habits for my body. All right. [in Taglish] Let's talk about compatibility some other time. [bright music playing] [squeals] Elton! [in Mandarin] [giggles] [sighs] [in Tagalog] Scratch my tummy. [scratches] Alice. Huh? Who? -Who? -Alice. What? [snores] Alice. [in Mandarin] [in Taglish] Benito said we should start at 4:45 because it's lucky. [in Tagalog] What time is it? [in Mandarin] [exclaims] [in English] Okay, now, everybody say "Happy anniversary!" -[applause] -Happy anniversary! Together! -[light music playing] -[applause] -[cheering] -Oh! [applause] [in English] Happy anniversary! [in English] Happy anniversary! -[in Tagalog] Mom. -[phone ringing] -[in English] Hello? -[in English] Happy anniversary. [in English] I'm so happy for you. [in Tagalog] Oh, it's your anniversary, but you look stressed. Just relax. [in English] You should enjoy every moment. [in Tagalog] How many Alice's do you know? Alice? Alice Ang, Alice Chiope, Alice Cochangco. Alice Ng, Alice Maliksi, Alice Ferrer-- Alice that's young and pretty. We're done, he will come here, see, he will come. [in English] Okay, bye. [in Tagalog] You're right. -[exhales] -You're good. [in English] Excuse us. Come on. Um. [in Tagalog] I'll go now. Who's Alice? Alice? I said I'll go now. I'll go because I have many things to do in our office. Okay? Okay, bye. [in English] Bye. [in Tagalog] He left? [in Taglish] He said he'll go to the office. [in English] Office? Warehouse? [in Tagalog] It's Sunday today, it's closed. Me? If I feel that he's cheating, I fight him. How many of Antonio's women have I attacked? How many times have you been in tabloids? [in Taglish] But in fairness to Elton, you're still his priority, Chona. -See, he bought a new condo for Chona. -What condo? -[in Tagalog] What? -Elton hasn't shown you? He talked to my sales agent friend last month, he bought it from him. [in Taglish, Chinese accent] What condo? I didn't see any brochure or… floor plan of a condo, nothing! [laughs] [in Tagalog] Maybe it's a surprise. Maybe he wants the feng shui done before he shows it to you. Maybe he bought it for Patty. [Nancy] Oh dear. Maybe Patty beat you to it. [Chona] Patty. Who is that, Patty? -Who's that? Patty? -I don't know any Patty. [in Mandarin] [in Taglish] I saw in your pager, you said "I love you". [in Tagalog] Don't be angry, you're pregnant, that might turn out ugly. Admit it. You're tiring me. Admit it. If you admit it, I'll admire your bravery. Fine, I'll admit, there is a Patty. What?! You bastard! You ruined my respect for you! You bastard! You bastard! [in Mandarin] [cries] [in Tagalog] He actually admitted it. He actually admitted it. -That's her. -Are you sure? She's Patty Lim Cruz. [in English] Chinese-Filipina. [in Tagalog] Elton's lover from Cebu. Okay, now I saw her. Wait, what are you doing? You only saw her back, not the front. Attack her! [in Taglish] All right, next time. [in Tagalog] What is this? Don't be a coward. I'm here at your back. Let's go. [grunts] Psst. Psst. [in English] Hi. [laughing] [in Tagalog] Why? She's not fair-skinned, I'm fair skinned. But she's pregnant too. I don't care, my child will be fairer-skinned than hers. Oh. So it's an insult to you, he replaced you with someone like her. Elton did not replace me. If he hits his head, he will come back to me. [light music playing] But she has a Mercedes-Benz. Brand new. Yes. Mine is old. [cries] [in Taglish] Oh, don't cry, remember the baby. At least that baby's fair skinned. [Chona wailing] [in Tagalog] It's painful! [crying] It's painful, I can't take it! I thought this will be next week? [in Taglish] Sorry! I can't postpone this! [in Tagalog] Watch your head. [in Taglish] Sir, telephone for you. Hello. [in Tagalog] Elton, I think I'll give birth now, come here now. You too?! I can't take it anymore, Elton, come now, Elton. [in Taglish] Ask someone to take you, go to Chinese General Hospital, okay? Ma'am. [in Tagalog] Hey, what's are you doing, Elton? -I'm here now, here now. -Come now! Quick! You're so slow. It's painful! [screams in pain] [in Taglish] Be at ease, Mrs. [in Tagalog] Doc, what time will the child come out? Three hours more. I'll be back, I'll just get something. Wait for me here, okay? The baby's coming. -It won't be long. -Just stay here. Just wait for me, wait. Ouch! Doc, take care of her. -All right. -Okay, doc. Doc, it's painful, Elton! Doc, how is it? She's at just six cm. Elton. [in Bisaya] Of course, I'll take care of you. [in Bisaya] Elton, I think it will be long. [in English] Take your time. [groans in pain] [in Tagalog] It's so painful! Can my child come out first? I don't want the other room to be first. We can do a caesarian section. Oh, no. It can't be, it's not counted in Feng Shui. [in Taglish] It must be normal birth. [in Tagalog] We can't hasten it, Mrs. [in Taglish] What do you think will be the exact time? Can it be 5:35? That's lucky in Feng Shui. I think in three hours' time. [in English] Huh? Three hours? [in Taglish] Oh dear, baby. [in Tagalog] You should come out now, you should be first. We will not be defeated! [screaming] Oh, God, I hope it's a boy. I hope it's a girl for her! Boy… I'll name you, Nixon. If you're a boy, I'll name you Hamilton. -Nixon! -Hamilton! [sweet lullaby playing] [cooing] [in Mandarin] Huh? [both in Mandarin] [both in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Mom, you promised me last month that you'll buy me a new cellphone. Oh dear, I told you I'll buy you if you have good grades. Mom, I even won at a declamation contest but I didn't get a gift from you. I already gave you a credit card. The card is not with me. The credit limit is so little. [in Taglish] My God, it's lotus feet. [in Tagalog] What is it, Mom? [in English] Lotus feet. [in Tagalog] Hi, it's Nixon. What's up? So when are we going to play? I don't know. Come, let's go now. -Okay, bye. -We'll go ahead now. -Okay, bye. -Okay. [in Chinese accent] Mom, you know Patty looks different. Oh dear, she had her face done. [in English] So, why did you talk to them? Mom. My God, she looks poor. [in Tagalog] Mom, she's pretty now, really pretty. What? I said, she had something done. Her face is full of injections. Nixon is alone, but has three nannies. Yes, she uses your daddy's money. [in Taglish] Mom, Nixon has a new cellphone. Really? Come, we'll buy a new cellphone [in Taglish] What model do you like? This is good, this also. What unit do you want, madam? [suspenseful music playing] [in Tagalog] Do you want me to slap your face? Mom. Let's go now, I don't want to buy anymore. -Madam. -[in English] Bad mood. [in Tagalog] She's grumpy. [suspenseful music playing] [in English] Bra, panty? [gasps] [in Tagalog] Jewelry? [gasps] [in English] Condominium? [man speaking in Tagalog] Feng shui has been done here, Mrs. Chiong. [in English] As you can see, it's a corner room. Facing east, ma'am. You have a great view of the city. [in Taglish] It's up to you, ma'am, if you want to change the design and furnishings. Beautiful. The unit that Mr. Elton Chiong bought. [in Tagalog] Where is it? Ah, downstairs, ma'am. What floor? Exactly below us. [in English] Directly under this unit, ma'am. [in Taglish] Good, it's important that my unit is above that unit. So that I'm above her and she's not above me. Isn't the unit Mr. Chiong bought below also for you, ma'am? It seems not. [in Tagalog] Do you know anyone named Patty? Patty? Never mind. [in Taglish] Take me to the unit below. It's furnished, but no one lives there, right? Oh no, ma'am, if the unit is not for you, then we can't go. [in Chinese accent] If you don't take me down below, I will not buy this unit. [suspenseful music playing] Ma'am. -[in Tagalog] They might-- -I'll be quick. I'll be quick. Just wait. Okay ma'am, I'll just be outside. -[gasps] -[music swelling] -[in English] Hello, Nancy. -[Nancy] Oh Chona, Hello. -[in Taglish] Call the lawyer. -Huh? [in Chinese accent] Ask what's the punishment for parricide? Why? [in Tagalog] I want to kill my husband. Where are you? [in Taglish] I'm here at the new condominium of Elton. He gave it to his lover. [in Tagalog] Did you attack her? Slap her? Kick her? Trampled her? What? No! I'm alone here. It's beautiful. What? There's antique. Gorgeous furniture. All expensive. She beat you? [suspenseful music playing] -Oh, someone arrived. -Here it is. Wait, wait a minute! [in Tagalog] We will transfer here, our new place. I will live here. Wow. It's fabulous. [Aya] Can I see? [in English] Fully furnished. [in Taglish] You're really lucky with Papa Elton. [in Tagalog] Winner. Oh dear, he's luckier with me. [in Taglish] Because even though he gives me a condo and a car, I give him a helicopter. -[laughs] -[gasps] -[Aya in English] I like that. -[both laugh] [in Tagalog] But girl, you need to have a child with him. You've been with him for three years, right? Hmph. I don't want because I'll be ugly. Of course not. [Aya] If you have a child with him, you have a hold over him. [in English] Don't worry, girl. [in Taglish] Maybe this year or next year, I'll get pregnant. It's okay to get pregnant, I'm sure you'll not be ugly. [in Tagalog] Unlike his wife, have you seen her? Mrs. Chiong. Not yet, but they said she's gracious. [in Taglish] Hello! Of course not! I saw her at a party. Ugly to death! And she doesn't have any appeal. [Aya] Ew. I'm sure she drools when she sleeps. [laughs] [Gloria] You're too much. Well. Ah! Ouch. [quietly chuckles] [Aya in Tagalog] Gloria, you're not funny, why did you hit me? [Gloria] I didn't throw anything. [Aya] It's really painful. Ma'am, will you buy the unit above? [in Mandarin] What? I thought that condominium is for Patty. [in Taglish] What's the name of the girl? Gloria. [in Tagalog] They call her Gloria. Oh no, they're really like that, the lover of my husband, she's so shameless. I've accepted that we're two, Patty and I. Now it's three. You just learned it recently, sister? You didn't get suspicious before? [in Taglish] Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Elton's with me. Maybe now it'll only be Monday, Wednesday. You're so focused with Patty that you didn't notice that he has a third one. [in Tagalog] What does his new lover look like? Big. -[in English] Six footer? -[in Tagalog] No. Big. -[dramatic gasping] -[laughing] Just like Patty. [laughing] [abrupt silence] [sobs] [in Tagalog] Am I ugly? Be honest. As long as it came from my true friends, it's okay. I will not be hurt. Well? Of course, you're attractive. Charming. What will I do? Fight him. Wait. [in Chinese accent] He might go to Gloria more. Before, I fought Elton, but it made him go to Patty more. Don't. That's unlucky. [in Taglish] The days for confrontation are over, my dear. [in Taglish] From now until May 23rd, there should not be any fights. Or you'll be unlucky. [ladies gasp] [in Tagalog] What should I do? [Mike] You should drink more ginseng, friend. [Alex] Elton, you seem to be getting weaker. [Mike] Well, because he has three wives. It's better that way. Instead of calling for escort service. Yes, you're right. James, he's calling your attention. [in Mandarin] [in English] I don't have to worry about that. [in Tagalog] You know, I'm having a hard time with Gloria. She's too demanding? Not really. Just extremely physical. Her sports are too extreme. I can't keep up. Do you know, how I persuaded Gloria? [happy shouts] [in Taglish] Rock-climbing. It's great, right? [in Tagalog] Can you still go on? I can, very much. For you, I'll do everything. You're sure? All right, be quick. Whoo! Then after, -we'll go there. -Ah. There, look. There. That, let's go there, okay? You know, I think we'll do it next time because, I have bad Feng shui today. We'll do it next time. You're such a killjoy. I think you just don't want to. Don't tell me something frightens Elton Chiong. No, nothing. All right. So there's no problem. Let's go now. Let's go over there. And my deal to you… if we reach the top, I will do everything you want. Then. -Really? -Yes. When we're already there, we'll hold hands like this, and then, both of us will jump. What? Yes! It's so romantic. So happy. Quick! Wait. Whoo! What? You survived it? I would not be here if I didn't make it. [Mike in Taglish] At Chinese New Year… how will you manage the three, Elton? [in Tagalog] You know, I call you friends, that's why you have to help me. Nixon! [in Mandarin] Mom. I told you to transfer me to another school. [in Mandarin] Well, I can't do anything because I'm not really good at Mandarin. [in Mandarin] [in Taglish] I'm not pure Chinese. Look at you, you're Chinese-Visayan. [in English] That's my point. [in Tagalog] That's why your dad is closer to his kids with Chona. Because they're pure Chinese. That's why you should learn Mandarin. Mom, look. We understand each other in Tagalog, even if you're Visayan. Oh, dear son. Will you let your half-brothers and half-sister outshine you? How will your father love us? So how will your father hand over his business when you graduate from college? Mom, I'm not into business. Mm. So, what do you want to do with your life? I told you before, I want to be in a band. I want to rap like, "Yo, yo, yo," like that. -Oh my god. -Like that, Mom. -Yes. -What rap? I want to be a rapper. Like, like Eminem, "Yo, yo". Like Andrew E. Like, like Vanilla Ice, it's like that. Nixon Chiong. -Rapper, yeah, yeah, yeah. -What Nixon Chiong? I don't like that. What are you doing, son? Mom. It's Nixon, Mom. -Not Nexon. -Nixon, Nexon, Nixon. It's the same. Okay, Mom, I'll leave now. -Nixon, come here. -Hey. Mom, my t-shirt. [gasps] -What's that? -What? -Why do you have a tattoo? -Ouch! On your back! Oh, God, son! -Oh, this? -Are you a gang member now, son? Mom. This is cool. See, it's cool. For a rapper. -This is cool. -What is it? I don't want that, get rid of it, son. Get rid of it! What are you doing? Mom, it will not be erased. It's permanent. Oh son! No! Come over here, Nixon. Nixon! Oh, God! My son became a gang member. Oh, maybe he's a commando. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog, Chinese accent] A girl should just endure. Don't complain too much. But Dad, I always endure. Until when will I endure? I'm requesting both of you. Talk to Elton. He will listen to you. Dad. Dad! [snores] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] That's his weakness. Mom, what will I do? Ah, you just let Elton be. You're still the number one, right? But, Mom… [in Chinese accent] In Chinese culture, women support men. Women sacrifice. [in Mandarin] [sighs] Elton doesn't mistreat you. You are three women, right? Gloria is kind, right? She doesn't make problems to you. You know Gloria? Mm. -She cooks delicious wheat noodle soup. -[father snores] Wheat noodle soup? [Gloria] What's this? Why is it like this? [in Taglish] I'm even wearing my two piece outfit, see. I thought the water would be crystal clear. [in Tagalog] But instead, it's like flood water, the color is brown. It's like mud. I'm sorry. Because it rained. No, wait, wait. [in English] I think it's not my day today. [in Tagalog] You wouldn't think it but, even my car got hit. [sobs] Let it go. We'll replace it with something new, okay? -Mm. -Wait. [Gloria] What's this? Makes me sad. How sad. [moans] Wait. -What? -So how? [in Taglish] We wouldn't be able to buy the country club shares. -[in Tagalog] Let me handle it. -Really? [moans] [moans] It's like, I'm embarrassed. I'll just save up for the… [in Taglish] three-layered pearl that Aya is selling. [in Tagalog] Go ahead, buy it. I'll take care of it. Really? [moaning] [in Taglish] So that it won't be too much for you, use my commission for the sale of the fire trucks and fire extinguishers… To DILG. That's what I will use to buy the country club shares. [in Tagalog] Is it okay? The commission is yours. I'll take care of the shares. [moaning and giggling] [applause] Why did you bring us here? [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] It's okay here. [in Mandarin] [Alex in Tagalog] Pal, there's a problem, BIR wants to talk to you. -[Elton] Huh? -[speaking in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Okay, go inside, eat first. Go ahead. My friend, take care of her. All right. I'll be back. [in Taglish] Many are worried about the coming of the year of the rooster. By the way, what's your Chinese zodiac sign? Let's go inside. [in English] Hello, everybody. [chuckles] -Hi, Nixon. -Elton! [in Tagalog] What took you so long? [in Mandarin] [Mike in Tagalog] Have you talked to the BIR? Yes, they're persistent. They don't want to go. I'll go now. Okay, my friend. -Take care of it, okay? -Yes. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] They say that it will be chaotic when the new year comes. [in Taglish] The peso dollar exchange rate will improve but… it's still politically unstable here. The BIR people are really outside? [in English] Good evening. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Pal, the BIR people are outside. -Why? -They want to talk to you. Elton, what's the problem with BIR? Nothing. It will not be long. Pal, take care of it. Elton, wait, that's the second time already. It will not be long, I'll go now. -Nixon, take care of your mom. -Okay, Dad. Why don't you just invite the BIR people to eat here? It should not be discussed here. -Oh. -It won't be long. All right. What's your zodiac sign again? You know, that's the second time someone asked me. Ah. [fast music playing] Sweetheart. I've been waiting here for a long time now. I'm sorry, love. I've talked to many people from the BIR. All right. [in Taglish] Let's go now. [in Tagalog] Let's go? Where? Come on. [in Taglish] Have you forgotten that… it's our lovemaking night now. [in Tagalog] Wait a minute. We won't do it tonight. Let's replan it. Because I have many people from the BIR. -[phone rings] -And also-- Love, please wait. Wait, I'll just answer this. [in Bisaya] Elton, you're still there? [in Tagalog] The food are already cold. You're still talking to the BIR? It won't be long. Wait for me, okay? -[phone rings] -Let's go? Wait, just a minute. -Hello. -Elton, what's happening? Come back here now. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] This won't be long, just wait. [grunts] [in Taglish] Tonight is love night. Mm. [in Tagalog] Elton, be quick, we're running out of topics. Why here? I should go to Chona first. Alex can take care of Chona. Pal, I'll go ahead now, I'm stuffed, Patty, thanks for the beer. Okay, pal, thank you. So, Elton, have you solved the problem with BIR? What happened? It's fine now. Dad. Why is it that you're sweating so much? And… your hair is messy. Oh, Elton, are you okay? You ask too many questions, sit down and eat. Go, Nixon. I know Benito is good at Feng shui. But the one I know is better. He studied Feng shui in China. Elton consulted him. I think I should know those BIR people. [background chatter] James, tell Elton Chona went outside. Excuse me, I'll just go to the men's room. Okay, this, do you like this? Chona went outside. Is there a problem again? BIR? [suspenseful music building] [suspenseful music continuing] [music turning softer] [in English] Happy New Year. [in Tagalog] I'll take care of our kids. [in English] Happy New Year. -Elton. -Yes? [in Tagalog] I can also do that, Elton. I will not stoop down to their level. [in English] I'm civilized. [in Taglish] I'm civilized, not scandalous. [screams] [in English] Sorry, ma'am. It's okay. Shit! [in Mandarin] [sobs] [in Tagalog] Mom, why didn't you tell us? [sobs] I'm fine, really. I'm fine, I can take this. Come on, Mom, it's so obvious in your face. It's so obvious that you ignore Dad. Mom. Is… is he going to leave us? Why would you ask that? Why are you depressed? Is it because of Gloria? Why? You know about her? All of us. For a long time. You all knew? All of you didn't tell me? I'm always the last to know. What kind of children are you? -Mom. -[sobs] We just don't want you to be hurt. Mom. [in Taglish] You know, maybe Dad is just looking for a new experience. [in English] Experience? What kind of experience is that? Buying a house? Buying a car? [in Taglish] What kind of experience? That's a very expensive experience. [in Tagalog] Mom, come on. Let's throw this next. Don't, that's mine. Mom, you're starting to smell like lime juice now. Sometimes, in the morning, Dad complains about it. His face becomes hard. He thought it's laundry starch, but it's cornstarch. Mom, stop penny-pinching. I'm not penny-pinching, it's just effective. Look at my skin, it's gorgeous. Your dad's face really becomes hard in the morning? Mom, you're becoming so obsessed. Take it easy, with your exercise, Mom. [in Taglish] Dear, your dad doesn't want saggy skin, he wants toned muscles. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Mom, I didn't give you that DVD to solve your problems with Dad. I gave that to you so that you'll no longer be depressed. My depression is gone, instead of just sulking here at house. And we're not certain if Dad will change if your body improves. Oh, dear. [in Taglish] I will not give up. I will try everything. Mom, those are really big problems. Problem? Why? [in Taglish] Your varicose veins. -[in Tagalog] What? -There. Oh, no. It really is a problem. I promised to myself, I will fight. Everything that Elton sees in them, I will also have it. You should do everything that they do to Elton. [in Chinese accent] He will see a new Chona. Patty's maid told me that Patty is very attentive to Elton. Hon! [Elvie] Every time Elton enters her door, Patty is there immediately to attend to him. And Patty even studied reflexology to know the proper foot massage. And she also studied shiatsu, Swedish and aromatherapy. That's why her room in her house is like a spa. Elton. You're really enjoying it. Add more strength. You're just tickling me. -Go harder. -You want it harder, huh. Like this? What the… -It's too hard. -Ouch! Elton. That's the second time already. You're too much. [in Taglish] Our problem, is being the number ones. Because we're the legal wife, [in Tagalog] we tend to neglect ourselves. We become complacent. We don’t improve ourselves. I'm not worried about Patty, I will fight her. [in Taglish] I'm worried about number three. [in Tagalog] She's young, fresh. Don't be complacent about Patty. That's why Edmond is here, my auditor. Edmond. [in Taglish] It's unethical, the thing you want me to do, ma'am. [in Tagalog] I'm not telling you to divulge everything. What I'm asking is Patty's income tax returns. Well, all I can say is, 230 million pesos is Ms. Patty's net worth as of now. What? 230 million? She's richer than me by 30 million? How did that happen? What are her businesses? [in Taglish] She has textile. Sports equipment. Trading, foreign exchange and chain of bake shops. [in Tagalog] She has a lot of bread. Gloria might even overtake you. Those are supposed to be mine. She took it from me. Dad. Mm. What is it, Anthurium? Dad, who is Gloria? She's the president of the Philippines, child. What is the meaning of mistress? Where did you hear that? I heard it from the TV. That's not a good word, child. It's for adults only. I watched it from a TV drama. They say that it's nice to be a mistress. That's why when I grow up, I want to be a mistress. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] So what is a mistress? You don't have to know. Is Mom a mistress? No. What about Miss Patty? Um. [light music playing] Oh, dear, I'm really confused about our family. Yes, until now. -They're still at odds. -And Mom's being paranoid. And it's hard to get along with Miss Patty and Mom. Then there’s a new one, Gloria. Maybe that's why I'm feeling this way now. What is it? Hibiscus, it's getting hard for me now. About what? You still don't know? That you're gay? You know? Oh, dear Hamilton, I'm sharp when it comes to that. It's so difficult for me now. I want to come out. I just want the people to know, that I'm gay. [in Taglish] So what's the problem? In this day and age. [in Tagalog] What are you saying? You still don't get it? Look at our dad. He's macho, a womanizer. So manly and muscular. Then he'll learn that his only son in the family is… gay. You know the tradition in our family. They really depend on a… boy. [in Taglish] There, where can you see a panty and bra worth 50 thousand pesos? Look at this, 250 thousand from a jewelry store. [in Tagalog] The last time Elton gave me jewelry like that, Anthurium wasn't born yet. What? Maybe this went to Patty. Oh, no. My suspicion is he gave that to Gloria. Ma'am, do you know the vehicle following us? -What? -They've been following us. I don't know them. Who are they? [bright music playing] Hi, ma'am. Do you know who Elton Chiong bought this for? The handsome guy, he's with a girl. What is it, ma'am? I will buy the exact, same items. Oh, okay, please wait, ma'am. Please find this. What are you doing? You don't have the same size. Doesn't matter. I want to know the foolish things Elton is doing. It's big. This is 36 cup C, ma'am. It's like my size. Hers is not fat. Big. Fine, I'll buy them. Okay. What kind of jewelry is this? -You have this? -We have, ma'am. Okay get it, I'd like to see it. [attendant] Ma'am, this is it. [Nancy gasps] So it's like that. Do you have bigger stones? We have, ma'am. Okay get it, I'll buy it. Please wait, ma'am. You're such a star, Chona! I will not be defeated. -Really? -Do you accept cash? [attendant in English] Yes, ma'am. [sings in Mandarin] [screams] [in Tagalog] Oh, God, what's that? What's that? Oh, God, take it off! What are you wearing? Oh, my God! That's my bra! Take it off! Off! Oh, God! Hamilton! You're not gay. [in Mandarin] -[in Tagalog] Mom, I'm gay. -Huh? [in Taglish] Since I was six years old, I've been collecting pictures of Keanu Reeves. [in Tagalog] Then when I was 10 years old, I wanted to pluck my eyebrows. Mom, when I was 12 years old, I wanted to date Richard Gomez. [in Taglish] No! That's just passing stage. [in Tagalog] Mom, we can't do anything about this. No matter what happens, I'm really like this, I'm gay. [in Mandarin] Mom. [in Tagalog] Help with Dad. I want to come out. Ah! Don't look like that, okay? You. [in Taglish] You're the only son. [in Tagalog] If you come out, all the riches will go to Nixon. -Be a man! -No. I'll prove to Dad that even though I'm gay, I can run his business. What business? Beauty spa. Oh, my God. I already have so many problems. Oh, God, why? You're adding to it. Your dad might lose more interest in us. So how is it that, I actually gave him a son. But gay? [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] It can't be. Be a man! [in Taglish] And you, Hibiscus, your responsibility is to make him a man. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Mom, you're also gay. Be a man! [grunts] [in Taglish] Here it is, ma'am. They bought panty, negligee, bra, size 36, cup C. [in Tagalog] Cup C? She's not cup C, you know. They bought a lot in the jewelry shop. [in Taglish] Jewelry shop? How much jewelry did she buy? -About half a million, ma'am. -Half a million? What kind of jewelry? -[in Tagalog] Ma'am, I didn't ask. -Find out, I want to but jewelry too. But bigger, shinier and more expensive, okay? Okay, ma'am. Do they have meetings with lawyers, investors for business? -No, ma'am. She's always with a woman. -Something like that. [in Taglish] Good, I don't want her to be better in business. Then, they always go to a derm clinic. -Derm clinic? She has something done? -Yes, ma'am. [in Tagalog] She enhanced her boobs? -No, ma'am. -Her chin? -Her face? Her hips? -No. -No, ma'am. -[in Bisaya] What the… So what part will I improve? [in Tagalog] There it is, gorgeous. [in English] See, I told you. You're as good as new. [in Taglish] No more varicose veins. [in Tagalog] Doc, are there any parts that need improvement? Face? Body? [in Taglish] Nothing, you're perfect. There, crow's feet, remove it. [in Tagalog] I don't see anything yet. [in Taglish] Discoloration of my face? You can do a peeling? Oh, jeez. Aside from the varicose veins that we removed, you're okay. [in Tagalog] Should we tighten this up? Here. -That, here. -You don't need it. [in Taglish] Are you going to model a bathing suit? [bright music playing] Dad. -Please follow up. -[in English] Yes, sir. -Dad. -[in English] Good afternoon, sir. Son. You know, I've been waiting for you. Because I want you to know, at a young age, you'll know the operation of our company. Dad. [in Mandarin] Mm. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] But Dad, I think I'm not gonna be happy here. You'll be happy here. -There are many girls here. -[gasps] -What? -Dad, yes, girls. Come now. Accompany me at dinner, okay? I have a surprise for you. -Come on now. -Ouch. [traditional Asian music playing] [both gasp] [in Mandarin] [Chona thinking in Bisaya] [church bells ringing] [Chona] Hmph. [Chona] Does he still love Patty? No. [Patty] Does he love Chona? Oh, it's a no. [both giggling] [both grunting] Visayan, unlucky Visayan. [chuckles] [laughs] [gasps] [sniffs, groans] Bird's poop? That woman is a jinx. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [sighs] [in Mandarin] [chuckles] -Hey. -Dad. [in Mandarin] Mr. Chiong. [in Mandarin] Trixia. -[in English] Hello. -Good evening, sir. Trixia. [in Mandarin] -Hi. -Hi. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] You're twenty now, son. Mr. Sy and I have already discussed it, and you and Trixia will be married. Marriage? At a young age, so that when your child becomes an adult, you're still young. [gags] [in Taglish] Excuse me, sir, I need to go to the bathroom. [chuckles] [in Tagalog] The kid's just tense. [in Mandarin] [retches] Oh, God, I'm having a hard time playing a man. Me? I will marry a girl? Oh, God, how many novenas will I pray? So that I'll be able to finally come out. [in English] I wanna be free. Is there a camera here? [sings in Mandarin] [flushing] [thudding] [light music playing] [uplifting music playing] [Hamilton] Lord, he's handsome. And he smells good. Don't let me sin. Maybe I'll try to fake a faint so that, [in Taglish] he'll give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation [in Tagalog] Ah! Who's this, disturbing me? Hamilton. Dad. What's taking you so long? I was worried about you. Dad, I'm sorry, the restroom was full earlier. I just took my turn. [in English] Anyway. How do you find your future wife? I'm sorry, Dad? I said, how do you find your future wife? [in Tagalog] Um, she's okay. [clears throat] [in Taglish] Let's go, come now. [in English] Stand straight. [background chatter] [in English] Hey, good morning. [people giggling and greeting] [in Tagalog] Mom, at home we don't talk about it and now even here? [in Taglish] Mom, this is a life and death situation. Marriage is not a life and death situation. Hi. -Where's our tree planting? -Over there. Ah okay. [in Tagalog] Mom, tell Dad the wedding is off. You need to get married, because that's the cure for your gayness. Hi! [grunts] Don't stomp your feet there, it's embarrassing, many people are here. [in English] Hello, hello, hi. Hi. [in English] Mrs. Chiong, can you tell us something about this project? [in Taglish] We have long been committed to saving the environment. That's why we're proud to say, we have planted a lot. [in English] More than 100 thousand seedlings. [in Tagalog] In different mountains. Thank you. Ma'am? Ask me instead of her. Let's go, come on now. [in English] Come on, dear, bye. -[smooches] -[laughs] Ouch. [in Tagalog] Ah! What the… Jesus! What now? Let's plant. [grunts] [in English] Excuse me, I'm not a farmer. [Benito] If you're still ugly, I don't know what to do. I want to have that too. So that's when Elton kisses her feet too. -The top. -The knees. [in Taglish] What is it called, foot spa? [in English] Foot spa. Spa, okay. [in Tagalog] It's gorgeous, look. What will it be? [in Taglish] Your skin will be glowing, I'm sure. [in Tagalog] What will be Elton's reaction when he sees her? It's good if he recognizes her. Oh, dear, beautify yourself more, then don't laugh or frown either. Don't open your eyes. Like that, stay that way. Or else her hands will crack. [laughs] -What will be applied? -[background inaudible voices] -Like that. -Here, here, that's it. Make your cheeks like that, then pout. -[in Taglish] That's it! Exactly! -Beautiful. So, I'm the lead guitarist. And both of you agreed that I'm the vocalist. Um. [in Tagalog] I think I won't be able to join the band. Because I'll get married. So what's the problem? It's just marriage. Exactly, but the question is, will our parents approve? For me, it's okay, it's okay that Mom will be mad because, the amplifier that Dad bought will just be wasted. Dad bought you an amplifier? [in Taglish] Yes, I was upgrading the equipment and then, he bought it. [in Taglish] Nixon, did Dad ask you to go to the office for training? [in Tagalog] Yes, but I didn't show up. Good that he didn't get mad. Not really. So whom are you closer to? Your mom or our dad? Of course, Dad! Because he's cool. Nixon. Do me a favor, please. If Dad offers you the business, accept it. Wait a minute, Hamilton, why are your fingers flicking? What do you mean? Of course not! Eat your food! Let's eat. [background TV dialogue] [loud smooch] So you're here. [TV dialogue] Can you please scratch my back? You just wasted one day at a spa. You can't change a person in one day, Chona. Maybe he was stunned. There's no effect, he just made me scratch his back. The dog is treated better, when the dog goes to him. There's a pat. Caress. Guys like him have a lot of tension, maybe he was just stressed out last night. And he releases his tension to his number three, like that! [in English] The groundbreaking will start next month. And at the back, you see, we will build a youth-oriented theme park. [in Tagalog] What is it, ma'am? [in English] A youth-oriented theme park. [in Tagalog] Chona, isn't that your land? That's the land I want to buy. I was gonna tell Elton about it. How did it become hers? [in English] This idea came from my son, Nixon Chiong. For our viewers, Nixon Chiong is a bright, young man. He's also into music. [in Tagalog] Nixon Chiong, she said. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] Girl, you're Visayan too? Visayan, ma'am. [in Bisaya] Where are you from, girl? -From Capiz, ma'am. -Monsters, girl. You're also Visayan, ma'am? [in English] No, I'm Chinese. [in Tagalog] Turn off the TV! Kill that woman! Have courage, girl. You should not retreat from Patty. Her doctor will have a hard time fixing her face after our confrontation. Are you sure we're gonna see her there? I'm sure, because I know all of that woman's hangouts. Here, look. No, not that, it must be more expensive. More expensive? Okay, here it is. -This, it's beautiful. -No, must be bigger and more expensive. The one I bought the other day, get it. My jewelry should be bigger, more expensive, -than Patty's. -Here. There it is, so beautiful. -All right, wear it now. -Look at this, it should be bigger. Fabulous. [screams] [camera shutter clicking] If it weren't for the Chinese community, I wouldn't attend, it's cheap. Mom, Alex is so pretty. She's not rich. -I'll go to her, Mom. -Nixon! [greeting in Chinese] [in English] Hey, Alex. I'm going to watch your movie. [fans screaming] Aunt. [in Tagalog] Lotus feet's whole family is here? -This really okay. -Let's enjoy this. Oh dear, it's cheap. No budget. -Hi. -But it doesn't matter. Oh! Oh, my God! Your gown got stuck, but it's okay now, go. Okay. [in English] Oh, it's you, is there a problem? [in Tagalog] You're my problem. Mrs. Chiong. -Yes. -Yes. Oh, I'm sorry. [in Taglish] I've been tolerating you for so long, for 22 years now. [in Tagalog] Don't shout at me! I'm also the wife of Elton. I'm the legal wife. [in Taglish] I'm the lucky wife, I brought luck to him. [in Tagalog] You're the jinx to our family. Oh, dear, I'm good at cooking, you know. I'm good at decorating a house. I'm clean with my body. [gasps] I have a clean body. I'm excellent at budgets. That's why we have many businesses and money. You stole Elton from me. Even the land I wanted to buy, you stole it. -So what? Is your name in the land title? -I was supposed to buy that. But dear, I beat you to it. -Go Chona. -You can do it, go. -[slaps] -[screams] You bitch! My nose! It's expensive! -[slaps] -[screams] Oh, my God. -Our moms are fighting. -[shouting in background] [in Taglish] Oh geez, let them. [in Tagalog] Chona! My hair! -[grunting] -[rock intro music playing] Look at that, shameless! Dad has a new girl. Hey, but in fairness, -she's pretty, sexy. -Sexy, cool. I pity Mom. Oh, my God, Elton's got a new alien. -Chona, you're right, you're beaten. -[whimpers] [in Mandarin] [doctor in Taglish] If you want your eye bags reduced, -we can use laser. -Hi. How much is breast enlargement? Are you okay? Mm-hm. Liar. If you're fed up with me, just say it. [Hamilton in thought] Shit, she's a girl with a gay heart. God is really good, I'm safe with her, we'll get along. You know, you're beautiful right now. I like your face. Mm. Liar. Nothing's new with my face. What did you put in your face? It's just put on blush. Shu Uemura? How did you know? Of course, I know it. And, you know, your nail polish… that's pretty, my favorite color, baby pink. Really? What moisturizer do you put on your face? You're really weird. [in Taglish] Weird? Me? [in Tagalog] You're a guy. But you wanna talk about girl stuff. [in English] Of course not! [in Tagalog] I just want to learn your favorite things, so I'll know what to give you. Okay. Mom, are you sure about that plan of yours? I'm tired already. I do the exercise videos everyday, but there's no effect. [in Taglish] But, Mom, those are just to firm up your breasts and butt. [in Tagalog] I want more. [in Taglish] Mom, there are those who died because of breast implants. [in Tagalog] It's cancerous, the thing they put there. Hey, you. Don't scare me. It's my first time to have courage to do something for myself. Beautiful. We're beautiful, right? And dear, we're also rich. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] And dear, I still can't forget your slap the other day. It was so painful. I didn't come here to fight with you. Me too. We're just the same, being fooled by Elton. If we don't join forces… we'll both lose. [speaking Bisaya] Elton gave her three businesses. [in English] Recruitment, restaurant, boutique. [in Taglish] Is there a bakery? [in Tagalog] No bread. No bread. [in Taglish] Okay, let's change our topic first. Dear, tell me the truth. [in Tagalog] Does Elton seem distant to you these days? [gasps] [in Mandarin] Admit it. You asked because Elton is distant to you these days, right? Dear, we don't stand a chance with Gloria. She's sexy, so young. [in Chinese accent] Elton will be gone for two weeks? Did you know that? Really? With Gloria? Yes. We will tire Elton. We'll make him lose sleep. Elton must have no energy when he joins Gloria. Of course. [in English] Let’s drink to that. Chers. Chers? Chers. What's happening to you? You seem so tired, you were not like that before. I don't know. Lack of sleep, I guess. Lack of sleep? But you always sleep. Let's go now, quick! [in English] Come on, hurry up. -Promise. -Go. -[in Tagalog] Later. -Quick. What are you doing? Move quickly! You're so slow! -Promise. -Oh, jeez. I'll make it up to you. [in English] Promise? [in Tagalog] I'll lose sleep for you. Come on, I'm just strengthening my knee. Be quick, it's so wonderful here, I can't believe it. [cheering] Yes! -[squeals] -[claps] Promise, later, I'll make you happy. What promise? We've been here for three days now. [in Taglish] Come on the view is stunning. I love it, yes! [Elton groans] Oh, so nice! [in Tagalog] Elton! Hey, wake up! What kind of a vacation is this? So weird. Elton. [in English] Be strong. [Nancy in Taglish] We're praying for it right now, Chona's breasts. That we hope that she'll change her mind about her bad intention. -[Nancy] Why end up like this? -[Benito] Yes, Lord. -Why are people not contented? -Yes, Lord. -There's Wonder Bra. -Yes, Lord. -I, myself want to reduce this. -Amen! [in Tagalog] Oh, come on! Stop it with your drama. I'm enlarging, not reducing. [in English] Ready? [in Taglish] Doctor, do you know the size I want? Mm-hm. -Lord forgive her. -Lord. -She doesn't know what she's doing. -Wait. [in Tagalog] What are we doing? Praying for her, use your IQ. -Lord, improve this guy's IQ. -Come on now. [in Taglish] How was your out of town trip? I've convinced many investors. [in Tagalog] You're not going back there? Whoa! [upbeat music playing] Is there a problem, Elton? Mm? [in Mandarin] [grunts] My back is aching because my new boobs are heavy. But still no effect. Oh, dear. Me. I had Gloria hexed but still no effect. [in Taglish] Elton is with me every Monday and half of Wednesday. Me. Tuesday. Then half of Thursday. [in Tagalog] We must do something. Of course. I'm fed up. Go to your woman. I'll keep the children. Why? Did I cast you aside? Did I abandon you? [cries] This is too much. [in Mandarin] ♪ My baby, don't you cry ♪ ♪ My baby, don't you cry-y-y-y ♪ [in Tagalog] Fine. Leave me now. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] ♪ Don't you cry, don't you cry ♪ [upbeat music playing] [cries] It's bad. I'll just kill myself. ♪ My baby, don't you cry ♪ ♪ My baby, don't you cry-y-y-y ♪ He didn't even stop me. Elton. If you really don't want me anymore, just tell me. [in English] I will take it. No matter how painful it is. [in Tagalog] Hurt me! Slap me! Ouch. Ouch. It stings. [in English] Elton, I cannot open my eyes. Ouch! Elton! [in Tagalog] Slap me! Chona, stop it. Stop it already. [cries] Are you sure it's here? That's the room Mom told me. I'll just wait in the car. You can't. It must be all of us. [in Taglish] Well, on second thought, you guys go ahead. Hey. [in Tagalog] You're a part of this and you're affected too. No, Dad's shenanigans are cool with me. But your Mom is affected too. No, not really. Okay, you guys, go ahead. I don't want to see them. Fine, I'll accompany her downstairs. Why? This is your chance to mention the marriage issue. I can't, I'm scared. Why don't you and Nixon go? To represent the family. Okay, let's go. Yes, who are you? Can we talk to both of you? Or else we'll be screaming here. Are you Gloria? [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] They don't know anything about this. I love your dad. We also love him. -Do you love my mom? -Yes, of course. -How about my mom? You love her too? -Of course, yes. You have different moms? You didn't know about Patty? I'm number three? In Chinese numerology, number three is lucky. -You love Miss Gloria too? -Of course. I thought I'm the one you love most. The most, yes. The most loved or the biggest spender? [in Taglish] Love, don't meddle here. [in Tagalog] If you love someone, you'll not hurt that person. My mom is hurting. My mom too. Your moms have been with him for a long time. I have just been with him three years. I love the three of them, okay? Please don't interfere, because you still don't understand me. Dad, that's why we're here, we interfere because we're trying to understand. I'm not a bad person. Hey, I told you not to interfere. Why would I not interfere? I'm the subject here. Their moms are joining forces against me. Just relax, go to the room. Whatever! It's not just your moms who are hurting. I'm hurting too. Especially when I'm at a disadvantage! [in Taglish] So I'm number three? Huh? [in Tagalog] Dad, is there a number four? No one yet. You've disturbed me, can you go now? But Dad, why do you need three? [in Taglish] I'm generous. [in Tagalog] I'm not selfish with love. Dad, we're also hurting. Let me be. This too shall pass. Maybe, this is just a fling. [both] Just a fling? Yes. [screams] -Mom! -[screaming] -Mom, why? -Emergency! Emergency! My left breast is missing! It's missing! My left breast! We have to go to the doctor! [cries] Damn you! -[shouting incoherently] -Ma'am, wait a minute. -Doctor! -Where's the doctor? I will make sure that all of you will go to Muntinlupa. So that the prisoners there will change your faces. Damn you! You're all criminals! [in Taglish] Chona, just wait, relax. -Don't worry. -You! You must have death penalty! [in Tagalog] You've done a heinous crime, you're a criminal. You must be a prisoner! My left breast is gone! [screams] What happened? Oh God! This wasn't here earlier, why did it become a belly? Why did my breasts become three? It's just out of place, I'll take care of it, free of charge. What will you put there? It's included in the special offer. -Free butt enhancement. -Butt? [in Taglish] Yes, buttocks. Butt. Damn you! I don't need a new butt! You must restore my old breasts! [cries] It's so ugly. [engine humming] [engine revs] -Where will we eat? -Eat? I'm sorry. [in Taglish] Is it a turn off? [in Tagalog] No, it's actually cute. Where did you get that word? My friends from school are… gay. You know what? -I'm gay. -[laughs] You know, I believe you. Believe me, sister. We can't be together. [in Taglish] Because we both like "notes." Notes? Yes, notes as in… [sings note] [in Tagalog] You're so good at playing gay. Hey, believe me, I'm gay. I'm not joking. Hey, believe me. Okay, I believe you now. Wow. Thank you, because you're gay, now we'll get along. What's this? Now that you know I'm really gay, you like me even more? Of course not. I really don't want an arranged marriage. Why don't we just tell our parents not to pursue this marriage? I can't tell them. You tell them. [in Taglish] I can't do that, sister. But you know, I want a boyfriend. But just a boyfriend, I really don't want to marry. [in Tagalog] You'll be happy with my surprise. [in English] Wait. [in Tagalog] Psst, Nixon, come over here. Come now, be quick. Come on. Um. [in Taglish] Trixia, this is my half-brother Nixon. -Hi. -Hi. [in Tagalog] You're really pretty, you know. [in English] Thank you. [in Tagalog] Wait. I think I've seen you before. You were at the Linkin Park concert? Yes, you're also into rock? So what now? I've got to go now because I have places to be. [in English] Excuse me. [exclaims] Yay! Ouch. [in Tagalog] There it is. Beautiful, back to its past form. Mom. How much was your breast implant? Don't ask questions like that, it's just for girls. You go, leave. Mom, come on. I'm gonna leave anyway. Oh why? I'm getting married. Well, you're gonna live here in the compound. Mom, can I back out? You know, it's not just your dad who's committed to Trixia's dad, but also your grandpa. If you back out, it's a big scandal. If you do that, don't show yourself here, okay? Is it aligned? Yes, Mom, it's aligned. Hey, get out of here. Stop that. Don't stay here. [in Mandarin] [in Mandarin] Who told you to make him best man? We've talked about this. But Mom, Dad told me. [in Mandarin] [in Taglish] Nixon's his half-brother. [in Tagalog] This is my son's wedding, why are they included? Does Nixon know this? Uh, I might have mentioned it. -But Dad said-- -No! The wedding is off if Nixon is a part of it. So let's cancel the wedding. It might go haywire. Hey, no. The wedding will happen. Now, if you don't want Nixon to be the best man, take his name out. [in Taglish] But the invitations are already made. Call the printing press. Ask them to make new invitation. [in Tagalog] Wait a minute. Why is Anthony Sia's name not here? I’ve told you before that he will be a godfather! Mom, Dad ordered it. I don't like that man. Now, if Nixon's not included, Anthony Sia is not included either. Hmph. Who's my best man? Anybody but Nixon! Maybe it can be John Lloyd Cruz. -What? -What? Dad, nothing. I'll just call my friends. All right, Dad, I'll just be in my room. [Trixia] Are you really ready to do this? [Hamilton] Yes, really, he was my high school crush before. Until now, it hasn't faded away. I always give him packed foods. But he doesn't know that I'm gay. You know, I fantasize that… [whistles] if only there's a same sex marriage. [in Taglish] But you didn't see each other for several years. [in Tagalog] Isn't he going to wonder? You know. It's impossible that we'll get married. But at least, I'll make our wedding memorable. [in English] By having him around. [clapping] [in Tagalog] Hey, Hamilton! Dude! Is that you? [clears throat] -Dude. -Dude. I didn't recognize your voice on the phone yesterday. [in Taglish] This is Trixia, my future wife. -Hi Trixia. -Hello. [in Tagalog] Did Hamilton tell you about our shenanigans before? I'm sorry, I'm soaking wet from my sweat. I'll just go to the shower room. [in English] If you don't mind, Trixia. [in Tagalog] Dude, accompany me to the shower room. Let's go, dude. Dude, I've missed you so much. [background chatter] [Drake] Damn, dude! You beat me to it! You're really getting married early? Dude, I think it's better to start early. [in Taglish] Dude, I was thinking to invite you to be my best man. Me? Your best man? Wow, dude! I haven't been a best man yet. [in English] Sure. [in Tagalog] Agreed. Really? [in English] No problem, man. [sighs] [in Tagalog] Thank you, Drake. [moans] [clears throat] -Thank you, dude. -All right, dude. Let's go now. ♪ Tangled and twisted ♪ ♪ Knotted and linked ♪ ♪ All things are connected ♪ ♪ Like chains, they're… ♪ Let's break, have a break now. [music ends] Let's go, dude. Hey guys, let's have a break. Cool. -Eating time. -[Anthurium] I'm hungry. [Hibiscus] Drink water, first. -Oh, Hamilton. -Yes? [in Taglish] Congrats by the way, even if Mom and I are not invited to the wedding. [in Tagalog] Oh, you know. I imagine that… when I'm married, I'm not going to be able to join the band. You still can. [in English] If you'll have time. [in Tagalog] Wait, but you like Trixia, right? Yes, but she's your future wife. [in English] Well, but I don't love her. [in Taglish] But bro, you can't do anything about it. And it's a fixed marriage, you know. Plus, many invitations were already sent out. [in Tagalog] Oh, dear, whatever! Whatever! I hope… I hope there'll be a problem. [in Taglish] I wish there'll be a tsunami. Terrorist attack. Earthquake. [in Tagalog] I hope things like that happen. -[spanks] -[squeals] You! You're terrorist-attacking me! Let's go now. Hey, we're already late, you need to be at the church now. I don't think I can do it sister, I think I shouldn't show up to the wedding. We'll all be humiliated, don't do that, okay? Sister, I feel like I'm on death row. [in English] I don't wanna be a lesbian. [in Tagalog] You have to face this, you can't do anything about it, anyway. Okay? Come on. Let's go. [quietly whimpering] [in Mandarin] So late. Still not here? -[traditional music playing] -[moans] The priest is here now, don't be nervous. Just relax, she'll be here. [clears throat] [in Taglish] Thank you, thank you, dude, thank you. [in Tagalog] Son. Don't be nervous. That's normal in getting married. Yes, Dad. [in English] Stand straight. [in Tagalog] Oh, here she is. What? Oh God. [Elton] Chona, what happened? Hibiscus, come quick. -Oh, God, come here, quick. -Why? What happened? [in Taglish] The bridal car was stopped. [in Tagalog] Trixia was taken. Taken by Nixon. It seems Trixia is gone, what are we going to do? Where did it happen? Just around the corner. Oh God. Wait. -[shouting] -[groaning] [in Mandarin] [driver in Tagalog] Sir, ma'am was kidnapped. Before I turned here. -Where did they go? -There, they went straight ahead. Okay. [engine starts] [cheering] Hamilton, stop it. You're embarrassing me. [speaking in Mandarin] -[faints dramatically] -[screaming] Oh, my God. [squeals] Water! Fan! Hello, Patty. -It's me, Elton. -[Patty] Why? What's Nixon's number? Is there a problem, Elton? Damn that Nixon! He disrupted Hamilton's wedding. -[car skids] -[car crashes] [dramatic music playing] Mrs. Chiong? [several women] Me, Doctor. Oh, geez, what's this? So many Mrs. Chiong. [in English] Unbelievable. [Chona in Tagalog] Why does he look like that? What's his status, Doc? [doctor] Still under observation, Mrs. [Chona] Elton. [Elton] Chona. [Patty] Elton, this is Patty. [Gloria] Baby, it's me, Gloria. [Elton] Oh damn, they're here together. They might fight here. It's better that I won't be able to open my eyes. Shit! The others might come too. [ladies shouting] Let us in! -We're all his wives. -Not allowed. [doctor] The patient is comatose. If he responds to the medication, he might regain consciousness. But there's a 50/50 chance that he'll be an invalid forever. What's the status of Mr. Chiong? [indistinct chatter] [cries] Elton. Elton. [sobs] [sobbing] [wailing] [wailing fades] [bawling] [in Tagalog] Elton is dead! [crying] Not true. Elton's still alive. Yay! [girls applauding] Lord, I hope Dad will be able to recover. Heal him as soon as possible, Lord. And also, Lord, keep him away from all danger. I hope, Lord, that Dad will have a fast recovery. Lord… I hope that when Dad recovers, he'll be able to accept, that I'm a girl at heart. You have high grades in religion, right? Yes, why? [in Taglish] Is there a patron saint for gays? [in Tagalog] I don't know. [suspenseful music playing] [Elton in thought] Damn. The three of them still here. They're excited about who I'm going to call out to first. Jealousy might arise. What should I do? Oh, Elton. Hi. Hi, Elton. [in English] Baby. Be strong. Elton. [in Tagalog] We'll go home to our house, okay? Oh, Elton. You'll go home with me, okay? -You like it better with me, right? -No. [Chona] With me. Doc. Why is he not speaking? Yes, doc. How are you now? Elton. [in English] Baby. [Elton in Tagalog] Shit, how will I get out of this? If I choose one, the other two will feel bad. But I need to choose. Elton. I know what to do. Where am I? Who am I? What? Who are you? [gasping] Doc, why is he like that? What happened? [in Taglish] Doctor, he can't remember? He can't remember anything? He has amnesia? [Elton in Tagalog] Shit! It worked. They didn't notice. He should not. But maybe. [in Taglish] If ever, I'm sure it's just temporary. [in Tagalog] He'll be with me. No, with me. With me. [in Taglish] I'm the legal wife. -I'm the lucky wife. -I'm the latest wife. The prettiest, most glamorous, freshest and most loved. [Chona] Latest wife is just a plaything. [in Tagalog] Indeed. -A plaything. -Yes. This would not have happened if it weren't for you. -You're a jinx. -It's your son. Elton wouldn't be in an accident. [in Taglish] Oh, girl, that's not the truth. [in Tagalog] You know, Chona, if your son didn't introduce that Trixia to my son, this would not have happened. Come on, Elton told me that I'm the only one he loves. [Chona and Patty] Me too. He was going to annul his marriage to the two of you. Because he will marry me, live with me and he loves me. Really? Is that true? Elton, is it true? Who are you people? I did a pregnancy test this morning. I'm pregnant. Doc, what's the status of my husband? He's my husband too. I'm not sure if he has amnesia. Just like what I told you, it's just temporary. But I am telling you, he's permanently disabled from the waist down. Waist down? Also below there? And even in the place. Down there? -Mm. -[all gasp] Doc, is that true? Elton, you don't have amnesia. Elton, you're awake. You lost your thing down there. -Is it true? -Yes. Who's going to take care of Elton? That's why we have to fix this problem. [in Mandarin] [in Tagalog] I have the legal right. I'm giving Elton away, even though I love him. And you'll not accept me because I'm not Chinese. [in Taglish] And I just want you all to know, that I'm not really pregnant. Elton. [in English] You're the best. He's all yours. [in Tagalog] Okay, for me… it's fine with me if Elton will be yours. What? You're saying that now because he's crippled. Before, you were the one insisting to take back Elton. Because I'm the legal wife. Stop it. Can we just stop fighting? Yes, please. [in Taglish] The important thing right now is Dad's condition. [in Tagalog] I hope all of us will take care of Dad. [in English] Sorry, Dad. [in Tagalog] Trixia and I love each other. [in English] Love you, Dad. I'm sorry, Mr. Chiong. [in Tagalog] Forgive me, both of you. Dad. [in Taglish] I love you, Dad. [in Tagalog] Dad, by the way… I'm gay. -Nice! -Yay! -[Elton's Mom] What did he say? -At last. [Elton's Dad] Oh, he said he's gay. [cries] [crowd applauding] [in English] We dedicate our next song to our parents. To our father, Elton. And to our mother, Chona. [giggles] To my father, Elton. -And to my mother, Patty. -[giggles] And to my girlfriend and wife-to-be, Trixia. [crowd applauding] [giggles] Hi. Hey. [in English] My husband.
