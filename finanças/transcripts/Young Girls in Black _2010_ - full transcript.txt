Let's go. She won't talk anymore today. I think we're tiring her. Grandpa's thinking about you. He'll come next time. Goodbye, honey. See you tomorrow. When can she change rooms? She won't get any better in there. It's sinister. I can't say. Make an appointment with the doctor. Sleep well, Noemie. Fran?oise will be in soon. I'm going home. A year later Seen a big brown envelope? I have to drop it off at town hall. Don't dawdle. You'll be late. "Don't dawdle. You'll be late." You really want that promotion? Why else would I study so hard? Must you smoke so early? Wearing yourself out for what? 3.50 euros more a month? You want a fight? No, just an answer. Stop. I know the tune: I stink. Everything stinks. You exhaust me. We get Grandpa's gift at 6. Don't forget. I'm not coming. You are. No arguments. And don't be late for class. It's not for another hour. But you're late. Your boss is waiting. Cut it out. See you later. I'm counting on you. Hey, Sam... She won't leave you alone. I think about death when you're not with me. Cut the crap. Why are you like that? It's not crap. Yes, it is. You're a pain. I have to pee. Why can't you be still? Don't wanna be with me? Don't be paranoid. Be right back. Where R U? Not with Sam I hope. CMB fast. Noem. I can't. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I said. Yes, but I can't. I can't now. Look, I have to go. I'm thinking of you, too. Lots of love. What's the matter? What is it, Priscilla? Stop it. It's not what you think. Stop it! Guys! Martin did the same to you. Exactly. Don't repeat my mistakes. Drop him. I'm just fed up. Get him out of your head, or he'll keep playing with you. Promise? I'm here for you, Priss. It's good that you came. I had an awful dream last night. I felt you near but couldn't find you. Where was I? I don't know. It was foggy. I heard your voice calling me. I panicked. I was alone. Then, there were flashes. I was blinded. Come on... Then what happened? I don't know. I woke up. Him, too? A goner, isn't he? A real goner. Him, too... He's hitting on her just to fuck her. She knows it. She must be afraid to be alone. Everyone pretends. All the time. Worse, we're already like them. Gotta be a genius to get out of this shit. I'm no genius. I never will be. Me neither, Priss. Me neither. Noemie? Priss! Isabelle? Shit, I don't believe it. Wait for me. Leaving without me? What's the deal? Nothing. It's just better if you go to class. Yesterday you said I could come. Don't you want to graduate? - It's not the problem. - It is. Be reasonable. You'll have the weekend to yourself. - You don't want me around. - Look... We want to have a romantic weekend. It's been a while, understand? Go to class now. And make Mark happy. Clean up your room. I'll call you. - See you tomorrow, Priss. - See you, honey. We love you. They dumped me. Cmng over. Dreamt abt U again. Weird. Be good, Noemie, don't smoke in the building. "I cannot live any longer. "My soul is so sore the light of day pains me "when I stand at the window..." Heinrich von Kleist was a highly sensitive and demanding individual. Nothing in this world truly satisfied him. His life was terribly difficult. This is what he wrote in a letter in 1811, at the age of 34: "I have become so sensitive, that the smallest injury "to which a man's soul is exposed during his life on earth "affects me doubly, triply. "I swear to you, "I cannot live any longer. "My soul is so sore the light of day pains me "when I stand at the window and feel it on my skin." Kleist had a thirst for the absolute that life couldn't quench. So one day he chose death. He was lucky to find a profound soul to die with, Henriette Vogel. On November 20, 1811, they went to the shore of a big, beautiful lake. Kleist skipped stones. 20 minutes later, he shot Henriette, then killed himself. A small stain under Henriette's breast, a thin trickle of blood from Kleist's lip. That's all. A precise, swift death with great sensitivity. When they were buried, their coffins touched, as they had requested. They were magnificent deaths, souls united in the infinite which earthly life had always refused them. To conclude, we'll listen to a duet by Robert Schumann about the graves of two lovers. At night their ghosts meet above and weep. It's a very gentle vision of death. Thank you, Noemie. Very nice work, as usual. Very precise, very well documented. Priscilla helped a lot. Good, Priscilla. Any questions about this tragedy? This suicide romanticism stinks. Kleist just wanted to die. Maybe he influenced Henriette Vogel. It's so morbid. They don't love life. It's sick to praise them. Sure, you love your life. It's great. Your death will be great, too. After work, drinking Coke in front of the TV. Don't talk like that. - What a sicko! - Clown! Cedric, please. That's enough. Calm down! Kleist carried out his idea. Priscilla and I will do as he did. This very night. So what if no one understands. We really have to wait? Can't we see Mrs. Schaeffer Monday? Please sit and wait in the hall. Sorry, Priss. Sometimes I say stupid things. Why did you say that? Why'd Torres snitch? It's pathetic. That's no way to talk. He was right. You can't say such things in class. Especially in your case, Noemie. That's freedom of speech? Answer me: Why did you say that? To piss them off. Watch your language. I take you very seriously. It's never just provocation. You've already tried to take your life. You intend to try again? What if I say yes? Will you call a shrink? I said it was to piss them off. That's all. What do you have to say, Priscilla? She's not involved. Let her answer. I have nothing to say. Can we go now? You've both been absent a lot. Especially you, Priscilla. Your grades are disastrous. How will you graduate? School isn't my thing. Anyway, we don't want to study. What for? To be unemployed? To be exploited? Exploit others? Your society is sickening. We should burn it all and start all over. You looking to get expelled? I'll have to notify your parents. Don't worry. Nothing will happen. I'm not worried. I'm sick about this morning. That jerk Sam. My sister, too. I get on their ass, for sure. They're sick of having me around. I'm just a dead weight. Come live at my place. It's small, but I can make room. My mom won't mind. That might be good. I'm with you, Priss. Let's go. What do we do? Go to the caf?? Wait, I have any idea. BURN What's the matter? - Want me to leave? - No, stay. But I won't be any fun. I don't feel like talking. I don't feel like anything. I'm sick of it all. That's all. So that's when you want to end it. It's always on my mind. I can help if you feel down. We can help each other. Look who's talking! So what do we do? Get some air. Don't feel like it? It'll be the same outside. We need the guts to do what you said in class. I've thought about it ever since. Is that true? Yes, it's true. It's obviously what should be done. The two of us would mean something. I've also thought about since I said it. If you do it, I'll do it. Okay... We'll do it. We'll do it today. I'm afraid of changing my mind. I don't want it to hurt. I want it to be gentle. Please, Sherifa, I need it to sleep. I need a prescription, Noemie. I'll have it Monday. Dumas is away this weekend. See another doctor. - It'd take too long. - It won't. I don't have an appointment. I feel awful. Look at my face. I'd like to help. Come back later with your mother. She's working. Sherifa, don't abandon me. Trust me. You know me. It's not against you. Come back with your mother. You're such a bitch. Well? He didn't go for it. What do we do? - Can I ask you something? - Just a second. Can Priss come with us this weekend? One second, I said. You okay, Priss? You're pale. I'm okay. Then I'll stay over at her place. Okay? Don't want me to? You're both acting weird. Don't be silly. So, is it okay? Why the sudden urge to go see your grandparents? It's different with Priss. So is it okay? Why make such a fuss now? We meet at home at 7. And be on time. And eat something. I'm sure you haven't. Need money, Noemie? I'm going. It's important, you see? It's the last time. What are you doing? Nothing. I'll wait for you. I'll be an hour. You won't change your mind? No. And you? Are you crazy? YouR 2 far. I miss U. Im alwys with U. Alwys. Sam? Sis, you didnt miss anything. Its raining. Thinking of you. Luv... - Always late. - I'm sorry. I brought back Schumann and Kleist. Something wrong? Your report go badly? Kleist was a genius. He sought the absolute. He, at least, went all the way. I have something for you. Stendhal's more cheerful. A little Italy will do you good. No, thank you. Why not? Something wrong, Noemie? Where's your instrument? I didn't come for a lesson. Then, why? I just wanted to thank you. Apart from Priscilla, you're the only one I respect. That's all. I have to go. I'm touched. But if you really respect me, we'll go inside and do what we planned. I've seen enough. Enough what? Not again? I'm just talking. It's dumb. Where are you? Brahms and I are waiting. Not taking off your coat? As you like. Breathe. There's no feeling in it. This is not an exercise. Brahms wrote with his heart. Use yours, too. Start again. You're not making an effort today. What are you afraid of? You okay, Priss? Why don't you call back? I hate when you do that. What happened? I don't want to discuss it. How'd your lesson go? My teacher was a pain this time. Haven't changed your mind? You know I won't change my mind. Don't you believe me? You're the only one I believe. So what do we do? Get some sleeping pills. Will it be easy? A cinch. We put up with the family a while, then come back here, swallow the lot, and when they start to work, slip these on. We fall asleep and suffocate without feeling it. Shit, my mother again! We're not late yet. I couldn't see you. Like in your dream. Except you never arrived. I'm here. You really tagged Mrs. Schaeffer's car? We're taking you in. Mrs. Schaeffer filed charges. Right now? This is shameful. - You're coming with us. - Leave her alone! - Calm down! - Leave her alone! Calm down! Enough, young lady. Sit down and calm down. You all right? You'll be all right. Would you calm down! Don't worry so, ma'am. You do your best. Thanks. You've run away twice, steal... A teacher complained: You insulted him on the phone. He withdrew his complaint. A suicide attempt last year... So that's a crime, too? I didn't know. How old are you? 17? 18? - My mother didn't say? - Answer my question. 17. How 'bout you? Close. What d'you mean, close? 18. So what's the problem? Hate life? No one loves you? Everyone's rotten? You're a bit young to want to die. I thought we were here about a tag? Mrs. Schaeffer reported your outburst, and her talk with you. That's worth a police report? Some have nothing better to do. We said it was to piss them off, to show off, that's all. To show off... - Where are your parents? - Dunno. What d'you mean? I hate them. I live with my sister and her guy. Where are they? Gone for the weekend. They have their life. I stay out of their way. What'll this crap cost your folks? Here's Grandpa's gift. - What is it? - A necktie. I found what he wanted. Don't brag about your exploits. Let's not ruin their evening. You really said that to piss the class off? Do I have to tell you again? Love according to its fancy Does what it wishes with us This god allows jealousy And this god punishes the jealous From day to day, love can hardly say What it permits, what it forbids 'Tis a child, merely a child... Grandpa is singing. It's Florence. - Can't it wait? - Go ahead. Where are my glasses? Around your neck. Around your neck. Like his tie? It's a very nice tie. 'Tis a child, Merely a child Encore! I only know that one. You said you'd learn another. When? With the gardening, the cooking... I do the cooking! - And it was delicious. - Thank you. Talking to his girl? He could've brought her. It's very complicated. They spend hours on the phone. It won't last. How about you, Martha? You ask every time, Papa! It's not good to be alone. I'm never bored. I've got lots to do. Leave her alone, Toni. Who wants coffee? I'd love some. Don't you like the cake? - She hardly eats. - "She" is called Priscilla. You both eat like birds. Do you have a fella, Priscilla? You'll embarrass her! It's just that... I'd like to get to know her. One too many and he'll say anything. It's because I'm glad to be here. That's nice to hear. Sure, always a good excuse. That's nice, what you're wearing. I like it. I bet you made it. I did. - We forgot the chocolates. - On the sideboard. - I'll get them. - Thanks, Alain. Noemie, what about your flute? I forgot it. I love to hear you. Her teacher says she's very good. That's for sure. An orchestra, someday? Talk about a drag! Everything's a drag! You better find something to do! That kind of talk gets on my nerves! You get on my nerves. That's no excuse. No excuse. What about my messages? You and your shitty romances! And you and your Halloween face! Come join us. You're not being polite. They were on the table after all. Relax a little. She drives me nuts. She knocks everything. I don't need that. She'll get over it. What're you doing in the dark? Nothing. Let's go see Chloe. How are you, Chloe dear? It's Noemie. She wanted to say goodnight. Sonia! Where's the pear schnapps? He's lost without me. We're disturbing you. We're making noise in the back yard. Could you close the window? Read to her a little. She'd like that. You can't move at all? Aren't you sick of it? It's not a life. I want to die. I'm going to kill myself. Don't. I'm kidding. I love life. I even cut down on smoking, I'm careful. Shall I read to you then? Shit, a prayer book! This'll be a blast. Seen Eliot? Do you know the Belles de Nuit? These flowers open in late afternoon. Gorgeous. You can watch them open. Really. It's fascinating. Toni could spend his life with flowers. Where'd he go? Eliot! Nature is all mixed up. - Pollution everywhere? - Not everywhere. But a lot. Have you seen Eliot? - Excuse me? - Eliot. Have you seen him? Try the woods. Won't you help me call him? The dog likes you. Please, help me. Help him, Priscilla, he needs it. You're sweet. That mutt is crazy, he does what he wants. Try over there. - Where'd he go? - Dunno. I'm going back. We'll find him. Don't go. - Sorry, I'm going. - Priscilla, wait. Was I out of line asking about a fella? So you have one? - No, I don't. - Don't want one? Am I making you uncomfortable? - Leave me alone! - Wait, Priscilla. You feel there's something between us? I felt it right off. I was watching you at dinner, you looked at me, too. I saw you. Girls like you turn me on. - I want you, Priscilla. - Leave me alone! Did you read to Chloe? Yes. Where's Priss? With Alain, calling the dog. We'll go home soon. Here they come. What's wrong? - What's the matter? - Let go of me! Stop it! What's going on, girls? What is it? It's me, Priss! Leave me alone! What is this? Open up, Priss. What is this? Priss, what's the matter? Open up! What's going on? Get her out. Priss, it's me! Priscilla, it's Sonia. Let me in. Come on, we're leaving. Priss stays here. Enough of you two! You take me for an idiot. What'd I do to you? Shut up, it's not you! Why would you do that? And you wanted to take Priss with you? What's in your head? Shut up. You don't get it! It's all your bullshit, and that pervert! Our bullshit or your bullshit? You're sick, Noemie. Very sick. You need treatment. Don't bet on that. You never cry. I don't remember when you last cried. You're not normal. Right... Feeling better? They've all left. Alain will come apologize tomorrow. Do you want a tranquilizer? Look at this face. Yet you're so lovely. Relax. Why do you and Noemie want to do something foolish? Isn't life good? - What's wrong with it? - Everything. That's no answer. There's always something right. Rest up, child. We'll talk tomorrow. Toni will take you home when you want. Cll me, Priss. Its drivN me nuts! ILU It's me. I'm so glad! Sorry about earlier. I was disgusted. That jerk! - What'd he do to you? - Never mind. Are you okay? Yeah. My mother was on my back. She crashed, now I have some peace. You gotta help me. I feel awful here. It reeks of old age. I could puke. I want to be with you. I feel awful, too. You're too far away. What do we do? Talk. Spend the night together. Okay? Okay. Let's drink something. It'll do us good. Don't you think? Well? It's okay. False alert. She's out. - I finished a bottle. - Me too. It was no good! Vodka. I found some pastis. 'Tis a child! Merely a child! That stupid song! I told you they were all dorks in my family. I swear, mine's worse. I promise you. Did you see? It's starting to get light. Hey, it is. I'll go out on the balcony. It's so beautiful. It's great. We've never seen it together. I love you so much. Me, too. We wanted to do it tonight. I could jump from here. And you? So could I. So do we? Really? Not afraid? Let's do it quick. What's that noise? I'm getting on a chair. Me too, then. We count to three. Okay. I love you, Noemie. You're all I had in my life. I love you, too. I can't believe how close to you I feel. You're in me, Priss. It's high. It makes me dizzy, too. Never mind. We look straight ahead. We count fast. One... Two... Three! Answer me! Answer me! Answer me! I brought your flute. I thought you might like to start playing again. Would you like that? I'll take it home if you prefer. Thanks, that's fine. I hear you eat next to nothing. Don't let yourself go, Noemie. Please? I'm okay, Mom. There's someone outside who wants to see you. Priscilla's sister. Will you see her? I think it means a lot to her. Will you? I'll be back later. I'm glad to see you. You know, Noemie, I'm really happy you're still with us. I should be in her place. Sometimes I also think... if I'd taken her with us that weekend... But you can't think that way. You hear me? You won't do it again, huh? Where is she? I miss her. I don't feel her with me now. She's thinking of you, you know. I'm sure she is. And she doesn't want you to try again. Ever. Did you cry? I often want to. It never comes out. It's not because of the medication now. I know. It's me. Don't worry. It will come. We'll stop here for today. Is there anything else? My name's Clement. And you? She's Gaelle, my best friend here. I smoked all kinds of stuff. I mixed hash with dried insects, dried banana peels... What a trip! They found me out cold. I freaked them out. There any rubbing alcohol upstairs? Gaelle loved two guys. That's why she flipped. Can it! I got those two guys out of her head. Now she's better. We talked a lot. Didn't I help you? Yes, Clement. Now that she's better, they're going to let her out. Isn't that so? Yes, it is. I'll do the same with Noemie. I'll make her feel better. Don't bother her. Man, I'm always starved. What're you doing all alone? Come on. Time to eat. What's wrong? Have you been crying? I can't cry. The doctor said you're better. You'll soon pull out of it. What does he know? He knows you well now. Sure he does. Will you come eat? Come to the dining room. It's important to see other people, make friends. There are others like Clement. He's your friend, isn't he? Friendship is different. It's deep. You tell each other everything. It's so strong it never lets go. There. That's how it is. Geraldine, have some salad? It's the third time Noemie's with us this week. How about a little concert to celebrate? You can be proud of yourself. I was really moved. Thanks. It's sweet to come all the way out here. - You leave tomorrow? - Early. Come see me when you get home. Thanks for everything. Take care of yourself. Goodbye, Noemie. - How about a drink? - Sure. We could even go out to eat. - You coming along, Noemie. - I'm beat. It's too early to turn in. I need to rest. We perform tomorrow. You're no fun. Come on. 'Night, everybody. She's a real trooper. And so pretty. Hows the flute? Me, back inside. Not serious. Love. Clement. Yes, Mom. You haven't called. How'd it go? People liked it. But I played badly. I'm sure you didn't. You're never satisfied. Were you able to see Grenoble? No time. Do you perform tomorrow? Yes, then we leave. We reach Italy in the night. I hope they don't stick you in a tiny double like in Belgium. We won't let them. Good for you. Otherwise, how are you? Okay. You sure? Yeah, just exhausted. I'm going to sleep. Okay. Have a good concert and a good trip. I'll call you there? Sure. Good night, Mom. Sleep well, sweetie. I'm with you. Me, too. It's just outside Ferrare... South of Florence... Noemie? We're about to get going. Subtitles: Lenny Borger & Cynthia Schoch Subtitling: C.M.C. - Paris
