There's no way I could've scripted this. I think the lyric of the song says, "I can't do this on my own." It's like, "Someone must be watching this close." Particularly for me, that's incredibly true. (all cheering) Anna Nti-Asare-Tubbs: The night that Michael was elected mayor is the same nigt that Donald Trump was elected. And so, it was this very direct conflict in what they were both running for. This victory is yours. If you look at this room, this room is what Stockton looks like.

He is the 27-year-old Democratic mayor... Reporter 1: You are 28 years old. Reporter 2: Stockton's 29-year-old mayor.. Tubbs: I didn't just become this because it's the flavor of the month. I've been talking about this stuff since I was in high school. The message I received a lot growing up was that the options I had, that I was in fact set up for two things. Prison or death.

Some of my best friends that in fact today are either in prison or dead, and that was almost my end. But luckily, and thanks to God, I was able to go to Stanford on a full scholarship. I was able to work in the White House. I was able to have lunch with Oprah Winfrey. And I don't say that to brag, but I say that to say all the quote, unquote, "success" has been motivated by a central question. How in the world did I make i?

I know you only hear bad things about it. Underneath the bad things here, I should say there's a wonderful community. And what a community! There are people here from all points on the globe to a much greater degree than in other cities. (crowd cheering) In one quarter, between 2007 and 2008, the value of homes here plummeted by as much as 80%. Reporter 1: Traders say this is the craziest day they have ever seen in these markets... Reporter 2: Foreclosures are still climbing, and Stockton has the worst rate... Reporter 3: Stockton is now the nation's number one city for foreclosure activity. Fitzgerald: This was the most foreclosed upon city in the United States, and it was real economic carnage. The only option was municipal bankruptcy. And Stockton became the largest city, up till that time in American history, to declare bankruptcy. ♪ ♪ Tubbs: My senior year in high school in 2008, we were foreclosure capital. We were beginning the layoffs. We were beginning to lead to the issues and the problems that caused me to come back and run for office in 2012. In that backdrop, I decided to run for city council. What is that moment where it clicks in and you say "I'm running in 2012"? I was at a community meeting 'cause there was a spike in homicides. And one of these activists, organizers, a dear friend of mine, who I really look up to. We were talking, said, "What are you gonna do after graduation?" I was like, "I don't know, I'm still figuring it out." He said, "Well, how many more people have to die before you feel ready to come back?" Interviewer: That's a lot of guilt to put on you. Lot of pressure to put on a 21-year-old, right? But, it worked! Tubbs: You need Band-Aids or anything? Stockton's not the only community with a homelessness issue. Stockton's not the only community with a violent crime issue. Stockton's not the only community with a poverty issu. I'm tired of talking about where we've been. I'm more interested in discussing where are we going -and then how do we get there. -(applause) Thank you. Daniel Lopez: Oh, I feel like this is the beginning of a long week. What's today, Monday? Got a problem with the printer. It needs paper. (laughs) See, around here, we get things done. All of the team works right here, so if one person gets sick, we all get sick. It just comes with the territory. The mayor's office is right next door where he works out of. In 2016, Mayor Tubbs gave me a call. He had two positions, so I said I'll think about it. Before that, I had a really good gig at the state capital. I had a staff of about 12 to 14. I don't know, so they convinced me this was the right place, right time.

We've had the opportunity now to bring in programs that are, you know, unconventional. We have a program called Advance Peace. The goal of this is to reduce gun violence and increase public safety. We have a thing called universal basic income, or guaranteed income, and the Stockton Scholars program where we're giving young people that scholarship 'cause we're hoping that they go out, get a degree, and then come back to Stockton and find ways to help the city. That's a way of paying it forward and then paying it back. So, those are the solutions, some of the bigger ones that we're looking at. And I think, for the most part, people get it. They're excited. They've never had a mayor like this before. ♪♪ Tubbs: For so long, the narrative of Stockton has just been all negative. And now people are looking to us as a place that's happening, that's moving. There's something happening here. And people are trying to figure out what that is. You have something called universal basic income that you... It's a pilot program, right? UBI, they call it, but it's basically, it's a fancy way of saying we're gonna give some people -free money. -Well, it's interesting... -How's that working out? Do they like free money? -(studio laughter) ♪ ♪ Tubbs: I knew it was a Stockton issu, but I was really shocked when I read that one in two Americans can't afford one $400 emergency. And I was shocked because that's not just people in poverty. That's a lot of people. So, I sent my staff an email, and I said, hey, you guys, give me something I haven't heard of, like, what's the craziest thing you can come back with? Two days later, they came back with you can just give people money. So, I said, that... that, that's crazy. I said, there's no way a solution this complex can be solved that simply. We are testing a bold social experiment in poverty alleviation in a space and a place that really mirrors a lot of trends that we see across the US. Tubbs: So, we're testing out the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration, known as SEED, and we partnered with a group called the Economic Security Project that gave us a million-dollar grant to figure out what would it look like to provide the income floor for people in the form of a basic income. So, $500 a month, no strings attached, for 12 to 18 months, depending on how much more we're able to raise. We're doing a calendar, a schedule, figure out, okay, when are we doing our community engagement stuff, when are we planning disbursement, when are we gonna meet with people. Lori Ospina: We will do kind of a two-step process. So, the first step is we'll filter out all of the neighborhoods in the city of Stockton where the area median income is at or below $46,000, and then we will randomly choose addresses, and we'll randomly send mailers out to potential recipients across those neighborhoods. Tubbs: What's exciting about this project is that it's giving us a chance to really interrogate our values as a country and as a community. Are those values really put into action? I don't wanna live in a community and I don't wanna live in a nation where people are working two jobs and can't pay for rent. I don't. Host 1: It's a silly idea. You never wanna pay people not to work. Host 2: It's like why a utopia is never going to be possible. The same reason why universal basic income isn't going to work. Host 3: It's becoming an excuse for companies to not pay a living wage to their workers. Host 4: It's liberals that are doing this, liberal management, liberal, liberal cities like Stockton. Tubbs: I was shocked at... not even just the amount of criticism, but just how nonsensical. Just like really not rooted in anything true. And how... personal the criticism. Reporter: Twenty-three homicides in Stockton so far this year, three in the Weston Ranch neighborhood alone. The latest man shot dead is 22-year-old Julius Batiste. Batiste was gunned down Friday evening. Investigators for the Stockton Police Department say... Lopez: There is an area called Weston Ranch on the far south area of town. (upbeat brass band playing) They actually had a police service station out there, and then when the budget cuts came, bankruptcy, they closed down that police service station, and now, recently, they had like three homicides. So, we're planning for this town hall tonight. The mayor, the council member, the police chief will all go in there, be on a panel, and get questions from the community. You know, there's a lot of emotions mixed out there. -Okay, I'll have you go in and then go in behind you. -Alright. -Just follow Brian. -Okay. Woman: No idea is stupid, silly, wrong. Nothing's bad. Anything that you think of that comes to mind that you talk yourself out of saying could have saved a life. Resources for our kids here in Weston Ranch. Scholarship programs, okay.

Because the issues, not just in Weston Ranch, but in Stockton are bigger than one town hall, one tragedy, and one meeting, but it's gonna take continually meeting like this all the time, in good times and in bad times, until we see some progress.

Tubbs: I remember last time we talked, you mentioned kinda this area downtown being kinda most area of interest. Is that still the case? All of the traditionally troubled spots, I think we've got people in all of those places, it'd be safe to say. No less than 15 gunplay engagements were mediated within the first 90 days.

And so now, my focus is how do we reach all those kids? In a place like Stockton, where we still don't yet have a public four-year university in our community, I think that this is exactly where scholarship programs like this need to, need to take root. Tubbs: Lange and I went to Denver in 2015. I was still on city council, and we met with the Denver Promise, which is a very similar program. And then Oakland announced an Oakland Promise. So since then, I've been obsessed with how do we make this happen in Stockton? Luntao: You may not know this, but Mayor Tubbs has been out on the road, talking to people about Stockton. Did you know that in Stockton, only 17% of the folks over the age of 25 have a college degree? We need to be better educated, right? If we're gonna attract businesses, if we're gonna attract the sort of investment we want in our community... Tubbs: If certain people hadn't invested in me and created opportunity for me or mentored me, I wouldn't be where I am, and I get really excited thinking about what if we did that not just for one student or two students, but for a whole city? (horn blaring) (rap music playing) Marc Levin: What do you know about the mayor? I was actually in some of his programs for Stockton Scholars. He was talking about how they got a lot of scholarships available for us, so, yeah, I was volunteering for a lot of his things he was hosting. Roscoe Brown: Yeah, Tubbs is a good guy, man. Good guy. Mike Marangu: And they say his dad is locked up. He's in Folsom. -He used to be on the block. How... -Yeah... -What's that like for you? -Yeah, I... I don't really know his... I don't really know his dad like that, but I heard a few things about him, and he was really out here. He was a monster, you know what I mean? That was the boogie man. We all went through, you know, the gang life and the street life, so our main focus is now watching these kids flourish in sports and keeping them out of trouble.

I was in the International Baccalaureate program, the IB program. Think I was one of two Black males in the program my year. I remember just feeling a lot of tension. I remember always feeling I had to fight. So, I would get papers back, and I would have to make my teachers regrade them 'cause I felt I wasn't graded fairly. And I would literally have to go through and compare sort of how they marked my papers versus how they marked some of my friends' papers and find discrepancies. Like, every single paper. And it was like, "He's disrespectful, he's defiant, he has an attitude." I really just respond to what I perceived as injustice or, or tacit racism. Nicholson: There was certain injustice that he just wouldn't tolerat, so he would fight for. He started out by being a little activist. He wanted everybody to know in that class, you know? Tubbs: I would do silly things like purposely sag my pants right before I walked into class 'cause they'd talk about all the "saggers," so I'd come in, sag, and get the highest grade with my pants halfway down. Tubbs Sr.: I was pretty good in school. I didn't even go most of the time, but I passed school. I graduated on time. I was pretty smart. My favorite class was economics. I played basketball a little bit, football. I did sports, but nothing held my interest, really. Back in the early, mid '80s, crack cocaine, that hit real big.

"When I was naked, did you clothe me? "When I was in jail, did you visit me? As you do to the least of these, you do unto me." What Jesus didn't say is, "You have a preexisting condition, so we're not gonna give you health care." He didn't say that, "You didn't earn food, you didn't earn shelter, you made too many mistakes." He also said how we treat the least of these in our communities are how we literally treat him. Today's not just about today. It's really more about tomorrow, what happens after.

Kidnapping carries a life sentence. -That's what it was. -We were talking about Michael Tubbs. His dad didn't kill nobody. He's got, uh, robbery with kidnapping or something. And that's what he got, a life sentence. -It's crazy how it's like very similar. -Yeah. ♪ ♪ Tubbs Sr.: It was 1996. I was doing a violation at that time for a drug-related violation. My ex-wife at the time was pregnant. When my daughter was born, Makayla was born February 14th, '96. They called me to my counselor's office, and they was like, "The doctor wanna speak to you." So I knew something was wrong then. And, uh, the doctor told me my daughter was born with, uh, birth defects. She was blind, deaf, had a hole in her heart, cleft palate, and he said that she probably wouldn't make it. And maybe a week later, they end up letting me out early on an ankle monitor. I wasn't working at the time. Didn't have no income whatsoever. And, um, then one day, like maybe almost a month later, the doctor called. Was like, um, "She's not gonna make it. This is probably the last day. We're gonna take her off the machine." So, I get there. I wanted to take her outside. She never left the hospital, never had fresh air. She was always on the respirator. So, I grabbed her in my arms, me... and my two little brothers, we went outside. And she died in my arms. And, um, that night, I cut the ankle monitor 'cause they let me out on an ankle monitor. I cut the ankle monitor off my leg, and, um... I needed some money to bury my daughter, and I ended up... some guys I knew that was in the drug game. I ended up robbing 'em. I didn't know it was a kidnap robbery. We just moved them from one spot to another to get some money, and I buried my daughter. I ended up with about maybe $3,700. It was 13 days after Mike's 5th birthday. Coco didn't want him to go to the funeral at first. And I talked to him. I was like, "Do you understand what's going on?" And he did. He was like, "Yeah. My sister's going to Heaven. I wanna go." And, uh, when we rode in the limo, he's sitting next to me like a little man. He had his little suit on. He was like proud. He cried. It like... I was happy and sad that day. I was proud of him for being strong enough to know what was going on and understand it, and I was proud of him for going with me, and I was sad because I was burying my daughter, so it was like a tough day for me. And I've been in prison ever since. That was '96. Tubbs: How's everything with you? How's the youth organizing stuff going? What happened? Who? (somber music playing) Isaiah. Tubbs: I know. He was already on probation. -What were his priors? -Gun charges. That little boy? What? He's the sweetest little, he's... When I came and spoke, -he was like my little staffer! -Dellafosse: I know. -He's like a sweetheart. -Yeah. (sobs) Bailiff: Be seated and come to order. The court is now in session. The Honorable Gus Barrera presiding. Alright, thank you. Good morning, good morning. Let's go ahead and call the matter of Isaiah Evans. Isaiah is present before the court. Council, Mr. Hillenbrand, Council for the people and probation. This matter is open to the public pursuant... Dellafosse: What's at stake is that life for a young person, they get out at 25. Life for an adult, like, is life. Like you're there forever. Tubbs: What's interesting about Isaiah's case is it's the same DA's office that prosecuted Isaiah also prosecuted my father and my uncles. Just fascinating how, 29 years later, you got the same DA's office, similar circumstances. Judge Barrera: Gonna come back on Wednesday and coordinate with the co-responsible's attorney and then figure out where we're going. Tubbs: It's also interesting 'cause my dad was in that facility when I was born. So, it's also like kinda time travel, going back and like talking to him, even though it's not really him, if that makes sense. If you look at the folks who are in our prisons, most of them come from povert. Most of them come from neighborhoods with bad school. There's a bunch of things that correlate to them individually being incarcerated. I think the biggest challenge is that as a society, we have to understand that people make individual choices, for sure, and people should be held accountable for their actions. But, at the same time, we also need to be held accountable as a community for the policy choices we make that create such unequal neighborhoods and unequal inputs for people. But that's much more difficult than locking somebody up... -Thank you. -and locking them away so we don't have to see them. Half those men in there have kids, and they're all 19, 20, 21. Their kids are 2, 3, 4, 5. So that was like, wow. The cycle continues. -(siren blaring) -(police radio chatter) Reporter: Glass shattered, three lives taken after gunfire on Finland Avenue and F Street shortly after midnight. Two people were dead inside the car: 18-year-old Tiffany Connary and her brother, 19-year-old David Connary. A third victim, a close friend of the siblings, 18-year-old Remilio Castillo, was transported to a hospital, but died. Tubbs: Remilio was actually a student in the Summer Success and Leadership Academy, a program I co-founded at UOP. So, I had lived with him for a week on campus. This is deeply personal, which is why I'm a little bit crazy about it because it's like these aren't just random people or random people's kids. These are kids I grew up with or I taught. Woman: How do you actually defuse the violence and deescalate the violence? Because I have never seen a community this stressed. Eric Jones: We've got two very acute paths we're on on this. One, solve the case. The other one is preventing retaliation. We don't want any more. Christian Clegg: Peacekeepers and Advance Peace have been all hands on deck, and it's a hair-width away from retaliation... -Tubbs: Hmm, yeah. -...some of the time and these... these great... these great outreach workers are just holding the line. (siren blaring) Aguilar: We're really trying to save our community, and how we do that is reaching out to our young ones that are losing their lives. How old are you right now? -Man: 20. -He's 20 years old, seeing a young homie that just lost his life was 18 years old. I got people calling me from prison, from youth authority. I got at-risk kids, and I take them to Advance Peace, and we get information from them like what's going on in the streets. ♪ ♪ Tubbs: Stockton's much more than tragedy. And I think what makes Stockton so great is that even when bad things happen, we always find a way to rebound, whether it's going from bankruptcy to being the second most fiscally healthy city. Whether it's having more homicides per capita than Chicago and Afghanistan. We always bounce back. Aguilar: Stockton has been a victim far too long of gun violence. You know, a lot of us have lost loved ones and family members and friends. Thank you for the people that are being brave in coming here. Some of us have just lost family members. It's hard to have this conversation. Rodriguez: Give me a situation, especially to young teenagers here in Stockton, that leave us shocked, okay? Mia. -Mia: Death. -Rodriguez: Death. I think us understanding that shocked is something for us to really dig deep with because of this whole thing with teens dying. I've lost three kids this year, and just thinking that one of them was in my class, hearing these lessons, sitting in my circles, met Mr. Tubbs when he was a council member. And now just really understanding that these things really could happen to them. Dellafosse: I think this is why we do this work, right? Um... aaah! I wasn't expecting to see Remy's mom here today. What a tragic yet very sad thing to happen in our community. (chattering in Spanish) And I when I think about Remy, I think about his resilience and his amazing character that he had and that he showed in our program. And we were very honored to have him. (chatter continues) It's gonna take more than just elected officials. It's gonna take all of us to really change what is happening in our community. (train crossing bell ringing) Aguilar: Back in the late '80s and the early '90s, Stockton was at a very low point, and we had contributed to that. Now, we're in our 40s coming home after 20-something years in the prison system, and little or nothing has changed, and even now the violence has gone up. How can we now make a difference and try to like really let our community know that we're not here to cause destruction? We're here to cause healing. (indistinct chatter) Iyanla Vanzant: The trauma that we are experiencing is genetic. It's historic. It's ancestral. And it's coming up to be healed. So, I'm happy to be in a government office that uses the word "healing," -as opposed to "fix," "change," you know. -(murmured agreement) It really is about healing to make whole again. Woman: Our city is running rampant. -Our children are running rampant, like you said... -Vanzant: No. -Let's re-language that. -Okay. Vanzant: You are now becoming aware -of where healing is required. -(murmured agreement) -That's what you're seeing. -Okay. Vanzant: So, we see the need for our children's healing, and... (chuckles) And we see... the absence of our Black fathers and our Brown fathers. What do you have for your matriarchs? What can... What wisdom can you leave us? It looks like the men are absent, but at the same time, their absence is causing the women to rise. -A man is who his mother makes him. -(snapping) A man is who his mother makes him. Because her heartbeat, her voice, is the first sound he hears. (murmuring) So, it starts from womb time, her being able to plant seeds that ultimately grow. Yeah. So, don't... don't despair. Don't despair. Nti-Asare-Tubbs: We put out a 160-page report last year. It was the first ever report on the status of women in Stockton. So that we know exactly how women are doing compared to the rest of the women in the county, the rest of the women in our state, and the rest of the women in our country. -(laughs) -You just blessed me. Nti-Asare-Tubbs: There's huge intersections between the SEED program and gender equity. And when we think about single mothers not having access to affordable childcare, they might use that $500 for something like that. And when we think about victims of domestic violence and their inability to leave an abusive partner, $500 a month can really make a difference for them. The biggest thing that I think Michael has said quite often with SEED is the reason there's not a training around what they need to do with the $500 is because we trust that they know what they need to do to make their lives better or feel more secure or reach for whatever goal or dream they have. And I think especially in women's stories, we're gonna see that. Reporter 1: We're getting the first batch of data on a free money program in Stockton. It started earlier this year, providing low-income residents with $500 a month... Reporter 2: According to the first data released, 40% went to food, 25% to merchandise, and another 12% to pay utility bills. Recipient 1: I paid down some credit card debt, got rid of a couple. Recipient 2: It helps me get diapers, baby wipes. Recipient 3: Paid all my bills. That was the biggest stress relief. Recipient 4: Get a battery for my car. Recipient 5: My son wanted to go to a football camp. Recipient 6: I saved most of it, trying to find a good use for it. Recipient 7: I can pay, finally, for my books that I need. Recipient 8: I have a sick sister in Orego, and I can't afford to always go to see her. Recipient 9: Insurance won't cover it. It's a huge burden off of our shoulders. Recipient 9: My daughter's birthday just passed, and it felt so nice to ask her what she wanted. Magdalena Taitano: I saw it on TV, and then I read it in the newspaper. And we got this letter and I looked at it, and I said, "Oh my God. Of all people in Stockton, they have my name." (laughs) I called them up and I said, "Is this real?" You know? This is not the time for me to... to refuse. (voice breaking): My husband recently... became disabled, and... I'm sorry. And he cannot remember anything. And he's... you know, so right now, SEED is a big, big help for me, for my... for my everything. ♪ ♪ Tubbs: I think I really enjoy having Stockton be centered and ground zero for a discussion that's not rooted in bankruptcy or foreclosures, but it's rooted in like what could a future social contract look like. And then when that data's don, for the rest of history, Stockton will be part of that conversation. Whether you disagree or agree, you're gonna have to cite the findings from Stockton, the stories and people of Stockton. Stockton's gonna help inform national thinking about how do we create a fair economy. Vivero: I'll be at San Joaquin Delta College, majoring in photography.

Zay'd go to school, went to practice, and did what he was supposed to do, and everything was fine.

As a young Black man, I don't wanna say... to use the word "war," but, dude, it's tough out here for us. And at the same time, I don't wanna feel sorry for us neither, but that's why we gotta be on top of our stuff twice as better. And that's what I try to get Zay to understand is, you got so many people that care about you. It's not just me, you know. It's a lot of people, from the principal at Edison High School, the counselors, to the people in the community and all the stuff.

Emily and Joy, they tried to bury you, but they didn't know that you were seeds. And for every single graduate in this class, growing up in South Stockton, know this.

But as I think about starting my own family, having some sort of, like, restart of a relationship, now that I'm a, I'm a man, would probably be helpful.

It acknowledges that there is a set-up, there is a system, there is a way things are designed. But it's not fatalistic. It's not saying, "Because of that, you can't do anything," or, "Because of that, we're stuck."
