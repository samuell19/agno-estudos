and passes Hidegkuti, too. shoots, the Hungarians can't get the ball out. But there is Grosics, big Grosics... and rolls the ball to Mr. representative, to Mr. Bozsik. Bozsik crosses the ball to the right... and got nothing out of it, Germany on the attack but again well defended by Hungary. The game is still a bit nervous. And there's Hidegkuti, rushing to the front. And it's Turek again, reliable in the finals. Dramatic highlights in first few minutes of this game. Czibor with the chance, but hits another player, Puskàs gets the ball... And scores for Hungary. 1:0 for the "Paprika-Strikers" by Puskàs the so called "Football-Hussar". The match continues, we'll have to see if Hungary is able to keep their lead... or maybe ... I spoke too soon... Hungary again on the offense this time from the right... A flank to the middle, fended off by fair headed Liebrich. Dear god, dear god. A failed return pass by Kohlmeyer. Turek can't keep the ball and Czibor, There is Czibor, Czibor barged in ... And with the toecap he scores the second goal for Hungary. 2:0 in favour of Hungary. Will the Germans again lose as miserably as in the preliminary round? Only a few minutes played and a clear lead for the Magyars. We'll have to see what they come up with. Ball already lost, counter-attack, but not from the Hungarians, now here is Germany They keep fighting, now from the left side... Now a flank to the middle and there's Morlock, Morlock, Morlock! 2:1 only one down now, we have to see that again. Once again, once again please, rewind. Turn, march. Show the goal once again. Where is it, everyone is waiting for it... In slow motion, here it is ... Rahn The ball rolls through ... and there is... The big toe of Morlock just before Grosics. The ball is prancing into the left side of the goal. 2:1 but I said that already... Now is the chance to... Morlock noticed the opportunity, throw himself away, and stuck it into the corner with his left. He surprised Gyula Grosics, who should have come out, yet he did not. And this means a goal, which electrified the German team. Germany now is showing they can play too and won't let them get discouraged ... Again on the offense, what wil it be... To right hand side now he needs to cross... No cross now, but he's a bit handicapped due to the slow motion anyway... Now comes the cross, but no problem for Grosics... He sucks the ball in so to speak. On it goes, another attack by the Germans, they're particualary strong at the moment. Morlock strikes but the ball goes out for a corner kick. Corner from the left side... Could be dangerous, Fritz Walter with the corner, and out again Another corner, something is in the air... Here comes the kick, everyone seems to miss the ball but ... Rahn Rahn, Rahn, 2:2, Rahn with the equalizer. Hungary seems a bit jittery now, I can't believe it. After they were 2 goals behind, Germany has the energy left to score the equalizer. And now, now, now, I said it already, Hungary on the brink of defeat. What now, Germany on the defense ... Cross to the left side, Hidegkuti, Hidegkuti, but Turek with luck on his side... From the post the ball bounces back ... Again Hungary with Hidegkuti, a cross to to the left... But Liebrich is there with his golden head... his golden thatch, here's Fritz Walter the "Director"... pass to the left to Schäfer, no it's Fritz Walter with a cross but... Grosics with the safe. He keeps the ball warm... and on it goes, still 2:2... Now the Hungarians, there a shot by Kocsis ... outplays two and topples. Two Germans outplayed, that was bad luck for the Hungarians. They outplayed two Germans, but then they managed to do a return pass just in the right moment, still 2:2. Half-Time and Germany is back in the locker room for some refreshments. The game continues. Team Germany is first back from the lockerrooms. And there's team Hungary. And down here is Herberger, I can see as he nervously eyes what's going on with Turek, but this Herberger really is a genious tactician. He fooled the entire world with 8-3. He did, even though 6 players are playing today from the West-German team which suffered an 8-3 defeat. ... passes back to his right forward, crosses, textbook Hungary. Pass now to the left forward, on the left hand side. No luck this time, but again Hungary with an attack on the German goal. But here's Librich again, solid as a rock no chance to get by this time. And if the rock should crumble, we still have Turek to make the safe. Two times he had to interfere, and now with a ball to Rahn. Rahn passed one, and another Hungarian but is then caught by Lantos. Hungary now is bombarded with one attacking play after the other by the Germans. Grosics throws the ball wide... And now a very nice cross to Toth ... Toth, not as dead as he shoud be... after an exhausting game like this, with a cross... But well defended by Eckel, just kicks the ball out of the danger zone, he is our youngest in the line-up... And yet another attack on the german goal... this time by Puskàs, lets the ball through... But Posipal with a nice feint and a header to Mai... Mai to Schäfer, Schäfer to Fritz Walter, our Captain with his 34 yeras of age still... still young und explosive, passes the ball... to his younger brother Otmar, Coach Herberger on the edge. Even more so after he sees this Chance... There is Toth, defended right on the goal line by Kohlmayer. Kohlmaier born in Kaiserlautern prevents a certain goal. The next ball which prances alongside the post. Germany in luck, they will be reliefed when them pressures 10 minutes are over. But here they are again on the counter-attack, Germany won't give up... still 2:2. Fritz Walter fires the ball in the wall. Briefly defendet and again it's Fritz Walter, Fritz Walter to Rahn... Rahn from outside the penalty box... 1-3 meters past the goal. It's a corner kick, quickly executed, Rahn to Fritz Walter, Walter with a dribbling... He succeeded and again with a pass to Rahn... because he's the best shot. And just as well saved by Grosics the cat. And now Hungary again .... Hungary with a solo, but our Toni, Toni the Footballhero... form Dusselforf with one safe after the other also with the luck of the brave. Hildegkutis strike only hits the outer net. What happend here? They're rubbing his head? I hope it's nothing serious, we can't afford to lose our Toni Turek now... Here is Rahn, Rahn in the penalty box, a feint, he shoots... That's the winning goal, maybe it's the winning goal... Goal! What have you done, Grosics? What have you done? Dear Listeners! Rahn's shoot just landed in the right corner... 6 minutes before the end of the match. Not only the 60.000 here in the stadium, you too in cinemas Look at this, Puskas scores... but it's an off-side goal... The Major was off-side Off-side... off-side... Griffiths waves for off-side. And then, one or two of the kids sent the referee to Hell, in the style of the Wekerle-suburbs. But let's not talk about that. They were exasperated. But they still had some chances after that, during that two or three minutes, Zoli Czibor's great kick, and Hidegkuti's unfortunate one... Bozsik! shoots, TONI, what a wonderful safe... And that's the win becuase there was the final whistle. Germany won the match, Germany is the world champion. Unbelievable, nobody could have imagined this 2-3 weeks ago. But now it became reality and very happy... they are now, the boys in the white shirts. Our German national football team curated by Coach Herbeger... And trained by him has now won the World Cup. Jubilation from stands to the fields... The Team gives thanks .... First the opponent's stands, then the photographers follow like an roused herd to capture every moment, every hug and every kiss. The match was over, right... The kids played well and with honour. Despite all, still-existing criticism. They really would have deserved victory. I don't know why do people still comment these days... when the entire team was doing everything honestly. Which means, they were trained, and played well on an unfortunately lost match. President of FIFA Jules Rimet presents the Trophy, Which is worth about 15.000 Deutsch-Mark, to Fritz Walter, The Captian of the German Football Team The crowd is roaring! Do not despair back home, dear Listeners! The boys are just standing downstruck. Do not despair! While the German team captain receives the congratulations by Major Puskás, they play the anthem for the World Champion 1954, For Germany. I mean... Let's go! These are the moments... I'm sorry! ... I watched the last 30 minutes of the film about the World Cup again, the day before yesterday, The linesman Griffith signalled off-side and then they whistled. Ferenc shot the goal, and you can see it in the film that what's-his-name, Horst Eckel is waving, just like Werner Liebrich, too. Fritz Walter Captain of the winning West-German Team in the 1954 World Cup For them it was already obvious that it was off-side. I don't think this was the English referee's payback for 6-3. I was raised as a sportsman. And I always been a sportsman. And as such, always fair. I can't even imagine the opposite about others either. I always said that, and I'm still on the opinion, and not just because Hungarians are listening to me right now, because I'm certain that there won't be another national team, like that Hungarian was. That team could stay undefeated for four years. Won against 36-38 countries. For example this was the first team to ever defeat England. They won the olympics in 1952. Everybody and everything was at the right places in that team. I felt sorry about the whole thing. Even if we became the second, and let's say suffered a 3-2 defeat from the Hungarians, that would have been considered a mad success in Germany back then. But we had a lucky day. Helmuth Rahn Member of the 1954 World Cup winning team It was raining. Everything was against the Hungarians. And everything favoured us. The cleats were obviously helping us, too. Of course they were helping us, but the only the cleats themselves couldn't have done it. All I can say is that I myself didn't take any dopes. One might get some glucose once or twice, but that's perfectly normal. Of course it was a great joy. People were celebrating, and they kept asking me, and they even said, Helmuth! That goal you scored is the top of your life! And I must tell you honestly, it really was the top. The match was over. We were supposed to come back to Pest the day after, because both Honved and MTK was scheduled to have a 10 matches tour in Brazil. We would have received 10.000 dollars per match back then, which was considered a lot of money back then. And then Uncle Guszti Sebes told us that we aren't going home yet, we must stay here. For 3 more days. We were given such an amazing welcome following the victory. Thousands and thousands were celebrating us on every station where we travelled through. Some people even climbed to the top of the station's glass corner at ??? And they were just hanging there. We were afraid that they would fall. A huge tribune was planned, adorned with flags. 50 % Hungarian, and 50 % red flags. An enormous crowd Karoly Joo Decorator was gathering already during the set-up. And so, we were listening on the radio what's going on. And the thing happened, I mean, that they didn't win the World Cup. It must have been 10 o'clock in the evening, or half past 8? No, 10, when they gave the order that the entire tribune that we built must be taken apart all the flags and everything else must be collected, because the reception is cancelled. The idea was that similarly to the Olympics in '48, if the crowd would want to lift our victors into the air, well, let them do it, then! I received a phonecall at home already in the evening, that everything is cancelled. So, there was not celebrations, but instead of that Geza Meszlenyi Leader of the Propaganda Unit of the Party Commitee in Budapest, 1954. a march at the National Theatre and the Radio, but they weren't celebrating the victorious team anymore. When we turned in to the Brody Sandor Street, there was a huge crowd there. Mihaly Varadi Director of the Tata training camp Well, I could hardly stop with the car, with the Commander's car. And the soldiers came after us with several trucks. And by then a despaired fan was already dancing on the top of the car shouting 'Death to Sebes!' Well, following that, the Commanders gave the orders, of course, Crowd control. We drove through the Radio's gate with an ambulance, and that's where the marching crowd was pushed out. Shame. We must accept it. The match was very sporstmanlike, we were leading to 2-0. We let it go. Things like that happen. The match is over. The new world champion is the team of West-Germany. By principle Hungary won that World Cup. Well, if my sources are right, I'm the most informed person about the entire event, from the beginning till the end. There was that fatal protest after the match. Aladar Palffy Fan And for a while I was the leader of that. I mean the protest... But I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart, that it was simply just a sports-demonstration, nothing else, and nobody else was mixing in any other themes into this demonstration. It was only about the frustration we felt for losing that match. But later on the High Court thought otherwise. And I was to become the suffering hero. This was another frog to swallow, so I did. So, you know, it was that when I told them that why don't you arrest the policemen as well? After all they were marching with us on the streets, cheering! For the crowd and the people! And then came such an answer like... That's it! Well, I mean, just leave it! It's not interesting... Did we lose it? We did. By principle... by principle everybody considered the Hungarians as victors. There is no love. When I had a lover back then, on Sunday afternoon I told her, because matches took place on Sunday afternoons back then, so I told her, go wherever you want, I mean within certain limits, of course, but rest assured, I'm going to the match on Sunday afternoon. When you see a trick or two, which is so spectacular and moves your heart, when you see something like that, ... then that's it. This cannot be... cannot be measured, cannot be explained why... There is no why. This thing has no why. This thing simply just IS. We arrived. Comrade Zoltan Vass was waiting for us at Tata, receiving us with a pleasant surprise, because comrade Rakosi was sitting with us, and then Piros, too, the minister. They got us off the train at Tata, saying that it wouldn't be advised to return to Budapest yet. Err... we could be harmed. As it turned out later on, this really was the situation. And so after getting off the train we spent the entire day in the Tata training camp, and then in separate cars, with 5-10 minutes differences between them we were sent to the capital, Budapest one-by-one. And I tell you honestly, after that, I was afraid to go out on the streets for weeks after that. On one hand it was the fear, and on the other, the shame. The gate closed, so I rang the bell. There were 3 policemen sitting under the gate. They asked me for my papers. And then I said, 'Here you are. Of course.' They looked at them, and one of them asked, 'Are you that Sebes because of whom we have to sit here?' I said, 'Well, I didn't ask you to come.' We walked up, and there were 3 more policemen in the flat, too... Then I said, 'Why did you come here?' Well, yes-yes... At this point I started to think, and realized how things are. Some even took vengeance on my son. Some of parents, who were waiting for their kids attacked him and gave him a beating. The kid was just lying there, and a news-vendor was wiping the blood from his face and as a result he started to suffer from epilepsy. We found the lost track leading back to the other nations through this. This victory was decisive for Germany following a lost war to find itself and be accepted by others again. And for us, Germans, that wonderful goal wasn't just a source of joy, but a contact-building tool used to open up towards the other countries. It was a real miracle for all of us. We were so happy that we went down to the field, because where I grew up there used to be some empty grounds still, and once there, we reenacted the match over and over again. One of us was playing Fritz Walter, the other Helmuth Rahn, and Kohlmayer. And of course we were madly enthusiastic. Francz Beckenbauer 106 times West-German caps Germany was right after a lost war. The country had to be rebuilt. Nobody liked Germans then. Not even in football. It took a long time before they got accepted back. Even FIFA only accepted back the Germans in 1951. And one of the first international game was in 1951, too, if I remember well, against the Swiss. It took a long time before the Germans were forgiven for all the things they committed during the 2nd world war. I remember, before that football was a working-class sport. Today it's different. Football became professional. And due to professionality even the composition of the players changed. Players come from different kind of backgrounds today. And if it's about an international match, than as a German, I can tell you that much that the entire nation would be watching that match. Cheering for it's team till the very last moment. Because they all want the German team to win, preferably. The team represents the entire nation on those occasions. In my opinion the 1954 World Cup must have been more important. Mainly because that was the time, Paul Breitner West-German player when the German nation was allowed for the first time when they could allow themselves for the first time 9 years after the 2nd world war, to feel like a nation again. It had a different significance than the '74 win, both politically, nationally and from the human aspect, too, I think. It's obvious from the fact that the '54 win had a much longer life. The '54 win is still a mythical. The victors are still heroes. In comparisan the '74 victory is almost already forgotten. For my football is not a game anymore. Rather like 90-95% business, show-business. We had to look at it like that. Therefore football has different rules, and laws than it used to when I was younger, or compared to what an amateur would have. I'm a professional. I earn my money through this. This is how I support my family. These are different points of view. Marching to the finals, and to believe that now won't just defeat England, but the entire world, well, naturally, this could raise en entire nation to Heavens, which otherwise didn't really have much fun. Well, that obvious cold shower, which is implicit to a sportsman, I mean, to lose a final, that's not such a shameful failure to me. But for non-experts, I mean for fans, and... and for maniacs, and lost people, indeed it was such an elementary cataclysm, which was almost as bad as the Mohacs-defeat, Trianon, losing the 2nd world war, or the tragedy at the Don's curve. Well, I'm reminded here of something Brecht said once, that 'Sad is the nation that is in need of heroes.' But how sad is a nation which is in need of football-players as heroes? But then, they really could play football so well! At the end of 1954, and I'd like to emphasize, that it happened after the lost World Cup, I ended up in a very painful and unpleasant situation, when I got framed by the suspicion of espionage, following some verbal report. And according to the words of the Minister of Defense of the era the suspicion itself was equivalent of high treason. And the consequences of this accusation were some governmental and national security processes against me, and a complete ban from playing. Hungarian football was supposed to reestablish and serve the national identity ravaged by ourselves and others. Today we are allowed to say this much, I think. About this as well. 23rd October, 1956. Everything was so chaotic. A lot of players, including myself, considered to leave the country. To continue the career somewhere abroad, on the West. Who knows when would order return to Hungary, and when could we continue playing? We left in '56 to play a Europe Cup match against Bilbao. Emil Österreicher Technical Manager of Budapesti Honved 1949-1956 And then under those circumstances the team did not return. Errr... first we started to tour around Europe, and honestly, this team played some wonderful matches then. Our first match took place in Essen, where it was impossible to finish the match, because the people filled the football-field as well. It was such an enormous crowd. And when we played all the European matches, I asked them to make the tour official. Marci Nagy was the President of the Hungarian Football Association back then. And so I asked him to make this South-American tour official. And then when we'll finish the tour, the team would return too. We had a lot of telephone- conversations, and in the end the answer was that the team cannot go on the tour. Obviously it was everybody's dream to get to South-America one day, and so the team decided that we'd go on the tour anyway. We played 7 matches on this tour, and honestly, we earned fame and honour for Hungarian football. 3 wins, 3 draws and 1 loss out there in Brazil, that was a huge achievement. Edson Arantes dos Nascimentos - Pele 111 caps for Brazil I remember when the Hungarians came to the Aracana Stadium. They defeated the Vasco de Gamma. Honved was playing against Vasco and Botafogo. They were fantastic. Santos become a great team only after that. Everybody in the world considered Honved to be the greatest team. And they compared Santos to them. The special train bringing the returning Hungarian Sportsmen and women from the Melbourne Olympic games arrived to the Western Railway Station. The relatives and fans welcomed our successful sons and daughter with love, who could stand firm despite the hard circumstances as well, and earned 9 gold medals to our home-country. The returning group was welcomed by Gyorgy Marosan state minister. I more and more felt like I must return home. I can't live far away from this country. I owe a lot to this homeland. And then the newspapers started to write that I-don't-know, Puskas did this, and that... And so his wife, who was still here at home, grabbed the newspapers, and went to Vienna, to show them to Puskas. And then they didn't come back after that. If they would have won the '54 World Cup, then they could have toured around the country for years. And then it would have been impossible to think that any of them would have left... Then this whole thing, what I just said, they would have become folk-heroes. And heroes don't turn their back on the country where they are admired. - Where were you for such a long time? - Well, we were looking for the luggages. - ... 'cos they came with the cameras. - And so many folks came all the way from Budapest to bring you home, your fucker! Ferenc Puskas 84 caps for Hungary, 9 caps for Spain This here is Ferenc Puskas. They say he was quite good at football. We just stole it, stole it, stole it. We grew old, Uncle Guszti, that's the problem. You might have! But not me... They want to make a film with Kiddo Puskas, Sebes and the others, who couldn't play football at all, 'cos now they all say it was so good when we still had that team. - Perhaps, but...! - No, but back then we had to play like that. This should be played! No problem. They will simply just learn it. But we talked about it! - It takes time! Time! Everything takes time! - Well, that's right! We had done a couple of foolish 'stot' stuff. I hope people still understand this word in Hungary. But when we had to use our legs or brains, we did. Everything was hard. This is a different world now. You know, I played on the '62 World Cup in Chile, with the Spanish team. This one is a different world. But people can find friends everywhere. Life is hard. I don't want to offend anybody, because everything happened so long ago. I don't want to say names either. Obviously a lot of things were said, but nobody were telling the truth. The truth was that we decided that we would accept the Brazilian invitation to Brazil. When Uncle Guszti was in Brussels on the second match against Bilbao, I told him, 'Boss! Come with us, and then we'll go come back,' 'and then we'll decide things after we discussed it with the boys.' 'cos Uncle Guszti said he is not authorized to do that. He couldn't come, and so we went to Brazil without him, and by the time we returned to Vienna, we heard that Uncle Guszti stepped off, and left his job. But... some people came to Vienna to talk to us... about our future and opportunities. They were acting with us on a very bad way, and certain players, who had previously returned home and did not participate on the Brazilian tour said bad things about us, like that we took the money or even stole it, and spent it. Which was a lie. And then came the hard period. Leaving the good friend at home, and a big part of the family. Leaving... Leaving 16 years of work in football behind, being a 84 times Hungarian caps, only because some people felt like it was in their interests to frame somebody and hurt others. When a man leaves his country behind, it means a lot of struggle to keep on with his trade, the thing he can do, to keep it and develop it. I had my wife and little daughter and a friend out here, who unfortunately is not alive anymore, and I had to provide for them! I did everything I could to keep on with this thing I got, to play on and to be able to perform still. I did nothing else, but working and struggling, and sweating, 'cos I put up a lot of kilos. When I came here to Madrid, I weighed 83-84 kilos, and I went down to 72 in 5 weeks! I had to do it, if I wanted to stay in this job. And this job is a very nice job. I love it, I grew up doing it, and I think, I'll die in it, too. This is probably the dearest picture in my life. This is the junior-team of Kispesti ???, in 1938, I think. I am the last one and smallest. And this here is my father, who was the trainer. This is a goal in the People's Stadium, against the Austrians, on the 6-1 match, I think, the 6th one, as I'm kicking it. The goalkeeper couldn't reach the ball by accident. And here you see four football players, who had the biggest fame in the world, probably, especially in Europe. Raymond Kopa, Hector Rial, Di Stefano and me. Unfortunately football has some laws. In football they say, that whoever scores more goals, wins the match. If we think back on it that the Hungarian National Team was unbeated on 42 matches... This was the 42nd, I think... The one we lost. The final. There was no... There was no chance to be applauded. But one's soul is at work, and his brain is at work, and his heart is at work, and to be honest, it wasn't an easy thing to bear. And it wasn't just me, but I think all of us were crying. My lucky charm was the ball. I had no other cabala. I only felt safe when I had the ball, when I could kick the ball. I haven't been at home for a long time, it's been 25 years already. My wife says it's possible I wouldn't even recognize it anymore. But I'm lucky because the wide roads are still unchanged. So I can still walk on them. It changed a lot on the way to Kispest as well... That's a metropolis! When we're coming from Pest, the Wekerle-suburbs are on the right, where I met my wife, where she lived. That part is still there. That's still there, and I don't think they'd bring it down either. On the left side, as I was told, that between the Ulloi Street and the Sarkany Street entire houses were demolished all the way to the Hunyadi Street, and they are building new ones there. And then the Church square, where some 31 years ago she asked for my hand... And... then comes the other part, the school on Petofi Street, which I occasionally visited of course. And then the Erzsebet Square, where we used to go playing football a lot, the Zrinyi street, where my grandmother lived, and right on the other side Uncle Feri Pezold had a pub. - It's still there. - Still there? - You had to take three steps to enter... - Yes. It's still there. The Hoffer factory on the left, and the Granit factory on the right, and the football pitch in-between. The homeland means what is it you feel yourself. My homeland is Hungary even though am a Spanish citizen at the moment. The Hymn is the same, you must stand up, and listen to it. And does one think about in the meantime? Lot of things. Some are good, some are bad, but we think about them all. It's like a fast-paced film, like the ones Charlie Chaplin made. A fast-rolling film, which you watch in your mind in couple of minutes. You see a lot, good and bad, and then think about them. The Master, Sanyi Kocsis left us. Let's hope we'll meet them one day. What can I say? We were of the same age, and... and I don't know... they cut off the feet of the poor man. He had vasoconstriction, and stomach cancer at the same time. He didn't know about it, though. They told him that he was operated with stomach ulcer. But later on I saw such pains on his face, terrible pains, like... I don't know, he was just sitting there, and caressed his poor leg. And... and... I couldn't stay there with him for longer than 20 minutes, because otherwise I would have just cried. When he arrived from Hungary I talked to him Zoltan Czibor 43 caps for Hungary for some 10 minutes. He just said, 'Go, Zoli!' he said... I couldn't have gotten more back home than what I got. 20 minutes later they called me on phone that he fell out of the window. A precious man was lost. It doesn't matter, we'll all go... No, not just go, but we'll be taken after him. We also live from the past... But there are some who say they don't live from the past. That it's impossible to live from the past. Only from the present and the future. It's not true. I decided to come, because I was afraid that the Stalin-days would return... Nothing more. I didn't come here because of the money. I was thinking a lot, I had a lot of problems in life, and I talked a lot with Uncle Guszti. I also talked a lot with the Spanish. And they always consoled me. Being honest, they're very nice people. I came to love them. Very-very much. And all I said was that it's much easier to take the pain while at home. Seco herida... That's a... Well! You wish to talk about emotional scars, right? Yes... There are some emotional scars in everybody's life, and others cannot see into it. When we're in company, then we either make fun, keep smiling and tell jokes, and try to divert attention from our emotional scars by actions which basically are easy to be believed by people. Like a clown or an actor, who basically make millions and millions of people forget about their troubles and emotional scars in the circus, or in the case of actors in the theatres, and the same way in the opera... That's why they're called actors. But quite often those artists have their own emotional scars as well. We must try to understand each other's troubles first. But we must forget about them, right before we'd step out on the stage... pardon me! On the green grass! And then we all fight for one! Victory! First of all to defend the club where... basically... whose dress we're wearing. And if the Good God blessed us with such talent, that we can defend a Hungarian homeland or any other country with it, that's an even greater responsibility! Wherever you go, to the football pitch, to any kind of match, be it a friendly or international match, no match was a friendly international match for me. Only one thing was before me. That the 10 million Hungarians that live in Hungary only, must be made happy, and those too, who are far away from their homeland, they should also be made happy with my play, basically. And to make them feel proud when saying yes, we are Hungarians! And... if we're talking about the soul, and about joy, well, I always loved to live among smiling people. Because this is like a plague. A plague of joy... - What does Hungary mean to you? - Mother. And father, parent. To be honest, it's impossible to express it with just two words. One must live in it. And the Hymn? Look! The first thing I do, is that I stand up, ... and cry... and then I'm overwhelmed by feelings... What more can I say? 25 years later... I'm at Ferihegy again, 25 years later. You left in rain, and you return in rain too! Remember? The scheduled Nr. 104 Malev-flight from Hamburg has arrived. - Attention! Attention!... - Pancho! Pancho! Pancho! - Are you all right? - Hi! Hi! Well! Greetings! He doesn't recognize me! - Of course I do! - I'm Teri! - Teri! - But she was at our place! - Hi Ali! Ferike! How come you came? Finally! You fucker! You dared to come here at least once! He's got a wig on his head! - Hi, Lajos! - Oh, my god! Who is this man here? - What's that? - Is Pista here? - He's here! - Hi, Old one! - Hi! - It's been a long time! - It was. Hi my dear Laci! - How are you? - Good. I kiss your hand! Hi! - Look the Nandi! - Come here, Sanyi! Come on! - Have you seen Mr. Kovacs? - Come here, will you! - Bozsike! Have you seen Mr. Kovacs? - Here is the scoundrel! And Sanyi as well! - Kovacs? Uncle Kiddo, you know him! He has a fucked up brain! How are you? Are you behaving well? - I told you, people don't know you here. - Hi! - Go to Daddy! - Go to Daddy. - I always had Puskas' autograph with me. Pitting! I don't deal with gypsies! - Hi to you all! - How are you? - Good! - I'll look for it. - No. I'll stay here and then... Tell me your phone number and then I'll call you... Dear mother! My dear little son! Margitka! Beles! Do you still thicken your potato-porridge? Are you well? Eta! Eta! Does he still steal the peas? It looks like this is still here. Somebody must have hid him, it seems. Well, yes. It's been a long time. It was long ago, but it was nice. Well, anyway. Such is life. It cannot be helped. Here is the other one, right? Even though it's not mine, this belonged to poor Cucu. I don't even know how could we play such a good football in shoes like these? My dear Cucu, unfortunately we couldn't meet, but then... Such is life. We used to live in a kind of house where there were 32 inhabitants, and 136 kids. And Cucu, who was my best friend, and his brother, who unfortunately died very early because of a sickness, who was an excellent goalkeeper by the way, and also played in Kispest. We didn't do anything else, just played football all day long. Hungry or well-fed. It's very hard to talk about it. The colours haven't changed it seems. Anyway... Oh! Don't come in! You're not supposed to steal from here! - The cops would take you away! - They surely would! But only after it! The cops will put you behind bars, soon! You still want them to put me behind bars? Hello, Swabian! - They'll think we are gays! - Look at that! - Right! Deák Buci Retired boxer Careful! This will be shown! I already been on Most Wanted! I grew fat from being too much of a cross-eye, right? Listen, I'm being dressed by the Women's Council. How about you? - How are you, Feri? - Where did you steal it from? This belonged to Csikar! It used to, but then the KGB came... We were in much bigger troubles before! - Bela! How are you? - I'm all right, pal. Don't! Careful, don't you bring something with you on the way out! - But I won't bring in anything either! - I know you wouldn't bring in anything! - But don't bring anything out either! - Would you believed we'll see each other ever again in life? - I thought about that! - I also thought about that! Your wife kept telling me, she'd take me abroad one day. But when? When I'll be an old hero, a Martin... - Ah! - You used to be prettier than this! - That's right! - And do you still visit that thing? Ah! No white folks have never won anything there! And coloured folks don't go there at all! Every horse I bet on gets a spasm! - How are you Feri? Let's talk, I'll update you a little! - All right. - And you're like a battery! - Your father... What was I talking about? - He got blind, the poor thing. - Well, that I know. - And Fules? When? - I don't know. We'll see... - Come on, you must go in to see him! - When we're done, and if we'll have some time left. - Can you still be a man? Don't! Don't ask such things in front of so many people! - This is going to be shown! - What was the last time you enjoyed it? In '45! When the Russians came in! That's when! 'Cos I can't anymore! I'm seedless! These days I excite women by promising a thousand and then not giving it to them in the end! They said when they took me to the police station, Buci, are you a peasant? What do you think? A pheasant! And then they beat me like a blizzard beats the countryside. My crossed eyes were so swelled up that I saw Sundays to be Thursdays! - You remember when you threw those things into the...? - We drunk the... - You remember? - I do remember! - You brought it to Szolnok! - I did! And still, I got 15 days in jail for that! A pack of official papers landed in the police, and I told him to throw it in the mailbox! We're going to Szolnok! - And he did! - Swabian! You swallowed a medicin ball! Meeting up here again, at this wretched place! Look! I voted for the People's Front! Am I doing it all right? I'll be right beside the fire! I'm already a size S! Neither here, nor there! There can be no problems! I lost my ways once, but I've come clean by now! You lost your ways once? When? When you were born that's when! - I met a rat. - Really? - Csicsi! - Is he still around? - He is. I told him, if they would mate us, we'd produce a beaver! Then he fainted! I said, let's go to Kobanya to Suszter! Tell him I sent you, and ask for a head-butt! He's uglier than me, damn it! He is so ugly that if he'd look into a kindergarten, the kids would stop growing! Nice kid? He was terribly ugly! Even though I'm not an Adonis either! - That's right! - Guess what! They took me to the police station, saying that I was violent with a woman! That I should sign it here! I said, I wasn't violent at all... I said... but he said, yes, you were! I said it was 50% only! I was fucking her from behind, she could have run away if she wanted to! I nailed it! A policeman came in... We have no bugs here anymore! The louses ate them! Dead sure! It's so wonderful here... Fucking life... What are you lauging about? Can't you just stop it? Fuck you, Swabian! They'll take me away because of you again! Tell me! You're like that too! You're happy to be here, right? - They're knocking outside! - You're happy to be here, right? - They're knocking outside! - But you'll be much happier... - ... when you're already on the plane up above again! - Why? - 'cos you're going back! - I don't go back. I'm going to... err... - Where? - To Cairo. Will you come with me? - Hell' no! To be your camel? - Don't take me to places where I must work! - Everybody's got cars these days! It's good here! I start at 7 o'clock in the morning, finish at half past 7, and even I deserve a 30 minutes long lunch-break! Not even the director has such a pass like I do! - Valid for five years! - Really? Good for land, water and air! Come on, what do you want? - Well, they're fighting for me in the... - Have you sold the boards...? Where am I supposed to be? In the Parliament, perhaps? I'll tell them that you sold the kits! Bullshit! I let two trams clash, and then they got me! 'cos I'm cross-eyed, damn it! I went to the Szuromis, and I pretended to be a wall-painter in front of his wife. And I was totally wasted as well, but still I moved the brush, and it wasn't straight. I'm that cross-eyed! And then Mrs. Szuromi told me, come here, quickly! That line is not straight! It will be, by the time the wall get's dry! You want to listen to this, don't you? Come, sit down beside me! - I sat with you a lot...! - Who cares about that... Sit down! It's not good to sit beside you, 'cos there is some... err... Once a man sat down beside me, and then he got arrested too! - This is better than a book! - What's that? - We'd never have believed that, together again! - But when... - It was long ago! - Tell it! When the Honved bus used to arrive it was always rattling so much! - That too! - There was the... - It worked, but it was rattling! - Rattling! You were something as well, you know! The Customs considered you their official smuggler! - We used to have lots of fun! - Quite a lot. - Ah, Swabian! We grew old! - We grew old. What's the new party called that you joined? That you joined? There is no Deak, but the Lord summoned me! Tell it what a great footballer was Meszaros! I wish we could have 2 more like him today! Alas, we have 100 thousand of them! He was such a great player that he headed the ball when it was still on the ground! They did a corner-kick twice if needed! And kicked the penalty from hand! United! For the goalkeeper, even... Then I told it to the centre forward, when you get the ball, just keep running, there is a fence and the bus is not here yet! But none of them were like the Swabian! He could run so well, that he didn't stop until Madrid! Hey! Stay here! What do you say, one fool more or less, who cares? Stay here! Don't care about nothing! Be happy, you're a friend! Stay here! You're just a stranger there, while here you're among pals! People accept you here! You an still be a trainer for a first class team here! Come on! You hear me, Feri? Nice bunch, right? I'm asking for a moment of silence! Let's think about those five boys, who are not among us anymore. - Somebody said something... - Quiet!
