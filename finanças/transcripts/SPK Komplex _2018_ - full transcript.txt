SPK COMPLEX These are the enrollment papers. The date of registry at Heidelberg University, and the subject he studied. Or she. Here, for example, we have Wolfgang Huber. Date of birth. Enrolled in 1955. Here it states: medicine. And in the field of philosophy thereafter. And what's his date of deregistration? That would be 1965. For certain points one can positively understand... what the Socialist Patients' Collective wanted. The situation was far from straightforward back then. The rector ultimately was stuck in the middle, he was worn down. And the case of Huber contributed significantly to that. Of course, the question of where violence finds its inception is an extremely difficult one. That was certainly extreme in Heidelberg. And from Mr. Huber's entourage, quite a few ended up joining the Red Army Faction. And that was a boundary, of course, which today is very difficult to comprehend. To understand when someone will resort to violence, at first against things, and then people. "THE SYSTEM HAS MADE US SICK; LET'S GIVE THIS SICK SYSTEM THE DEATH BLOW" SOCIALIST PATIENTS' COLLECTIVE IN JUNE, 1970 Professor Peter Brückner from Hannover has written an expert report about the SPK, two months ago. He will now speak. I ask the comrades and friends of the SPK not to take it as criticism, when I begin my speech with the following: I've wondered how I can make this as brief as possible, and I thought, perhaps the SPK's problem can be summarized in one single, although admittedly rather long sentence. "The stone that is thrown at the command center of capital and the kidney stone, with which another suffers, are interchangeable. Protect yourselves from kidney stones!" TO THE LIVELY SPIRIT There's nothing more to add to this. Only that, of course, also the doctors, and doctors in particular, have proven themselves as incompetent, because they only serve the interests of capital, and because sickness is something that these doctors use to drive people to suicide, to lock people up in jail, working together with the judicial system and all these authorities. Bravo! And liberation from these constraints can only be achieved by those affected, which is everyone, because we're all ill, everyone in this society is being made ill, and is exposed to these debilitating constraints of society. "Document X 4350 Huber / 4. Ministry of the Interior, Baden-Württemberg. Stuttgart, November 17, 1970. To the Ministry of Education, Baden-Württemberg. Subject: Patient group of Dr. Huber /Socialist Patients' Collective. The treatment of patients by Dr. Huber cannot presently be prevented at our end. As a result of his title, Dr. Huber is authorized to practice the profession without restriction. He is not required to be a psychiatric specialist. What measures can be taken to protect patients cannot be assessed in detail. Conceivable are legal measures according to par. 1 of police law if a danger has been confirmed. In addition, accommodation in a psychiatric hospital can be considered under the Hospitalization Act, if its requirements are fulfilled. Signed per pro., Dr. Stöckel." Back then in Heidelberg, also according to Governor Filbinger of Baden-Württemberg, it was a pre-revolutionary situation. Things were already tapering off in Berlin in '68, when Heidelberg started going crazy. There were also quite militant demonstrations. The SPK was already toying with the idea of "armed struggle," so to speak. Then in the final stage, some people glued a photo of Mao Zedong into their I.D. And there was a flyer going around, saying: "We demand 500 weapon permits for patients!" Total nonsense, you know. The SPK said that sickness is no individual matter, you know, so when one has burnout, it isn't, as the treatment suggests, an individual problem, but rather a societal problem. Not to internalize protest, but to externalize it, and collectively fight the conditions that make us sick. In short: "Turn illness into a weapon." This is the original map of the madhouse of Trieste, so this is the general planimetry. Here you enter the madhouse, then follow it around and up here, make a U-turn, which continues along here. This was the children's ward. At the time of Basaglia's arrival, there were 260 children, and within three years, he sent them all back to their families and wherever else. He released them all from the madhouse. This was the central management. And then it started here. This was the women's observation department. The women were up here. And this was the men's observation department. This was the women's ward. Then the half... what's the word, half-agitated, semi-agitated. Women and men. The overly agitated patients, "agitato," the agitated patients. Semi-agitated here. Agitated there. And up here, the paralytic and filthy. And here were the "casetta tranquilli," the calm ones. "Tranquillo" means "tranqui." Calm patients, who wouldn't cause a ruckus. Calm women here and here. The church is here, parking for the hearse is across the way, and the exit is up there. How many patients were there, when you got to Trieste? - 1200. Well, when I arrived there were still around 750. When did you decide to work in the hospital? - 1976. Was that a result of the four-year sentence? No, I just thought I needed to go where they'd let me do something interesting. I didn't land here so much as an SPK member, but as an RAF member. After jail. Because, well, the SPK... what was really complicated was my sentence for my affiliation with the RAF, because in Italy the Brigate Rosse were in full operation. Those weren't easy times. "Document: Patient info No. 7 of the Socialist Patients' Collective, July 14, 1970. Hospitals are places of production in the same way that factories are. The patient must turn in everything he has produced there..." ... stool, blood, urine, bile, kidney and bladder stones, body parts, headaches, hallucinations, hypertension, states of restlessness, pains in the neck, etc. "These products translate to medical bills, lab bills, administrative costs and so on. Thus, the illness flows back into the state treasury and economic process to the highest bidder." Then Huber began working till 11, 12 at night. And then he was told he wasn't working right, because Huber, like myself, couldn't get out of bed and rather went to work at 10 a.m. But then he wouldn't leave. The physicians' briefing was at 8 a.m., and at some point he sent his male nurse. The doctors used to have personal nurses, and he sent him to the physicians' briefing. And you can't do that. Then you're dead. Right? In that epoch. To send a nurse on your behalf to a physicians' briefing, etc., and to discuss cases, then you're out. You can't do that. It's an unimaginable affront. You're basically saying, "You only talk nonsense anyway, so a nurse will do just fine." PATIENTS AND MEDICINE PROJECT GROUP PROTEST BY HUNGER STRIKE AGAINST THE DISMISSAL OF POLITICALLY INCONVENIENT DR. HUBER WE'RE PROTESTING THE DISMISSAL OF POLITICALLY INCONVENIENT DR. HUBER At some point, Huber took the heat because he stopped committing people to Wiesloch. The state psychiatry? Sure, that was the task. You had to sit there, and the student was committed to the psychiatric department, and the rest were sent to the madhouse in Wiesloch. And Huber interrupted that. That was very much to Huber's credit. Something they all should acknowledge. What Huber did back then was resist. Finally, someone resisted! That was Huber's story. Eventually, he flipped out, I think. It went off the rails. I don't know. I think these two were close. Can that be? Those two. Doesn't look like Rasputin at all. The participants note with surprise that the Baden-Württemberg Ministry of Education has ordered the dissolution of the Socialist Patients' Collective. The Ministry of Education should be aware that the measures taken have put the 230 SPK patients at acute risk. Axel, mind your adrenaline levels. It would thus be advisable for those people to visit the SPK and be healed of their symptoms and see for themselves how we work, and not to perpetually demand of us to submit theoretical concepts, when it's evident that for over seven months we've achieved tremendous results, something that all the institutes haven't yet managed, to their own admission. There were really people in the SPK who weren't committed just once, but had been in treatment for years. And for those people to be thrown out and banned from the hospital was a factor that didn't concern or affect me. What affected me was that they threw us out because they were an institution, that, like in the old days, we weren't allowed to criticize or scrutinize. And there were really people in the SPK who took the house ban as a personal threat to their existence, because they believed they needed a clinic. There was a conflict in the university psychiatric polyclinic. Huber, the attending physician at the time, was discharged. The patients left with him. The group... it didn't even occur to them to end their group therapy. That's the common room. And that's Wolfgang Huber. There was a small library inside the room, where, of course, you could read Basaglia, Foucault and Wilhelm Reich. Outside you have Rohrbacher Strasse. The problem is, you couldn't work there in peace and quiet.. Evenings were better, but daytime... I also conducted "single agitation" sessions. We'd sit in the hallway on the floor and the doorbell wouldn't stop ringing, people constantly came and went, etc. There was a huge demand. Soul healing by means of revolution. Not only the set-up of the therapy room documents the break with conventional psychotherapy. For the better part of eight months, the Socialist Patients' Collective in Heidelberg has been practicing its own doctrine of salvation, on a Marxist basis. If the conditions cause illness, then everyone is ill. Even the doctor. Hence, the doctor must be involved in a critical debate. As a result and as a beginning of our work, the indications are cooperation, solidarity and emancipation. Yes, that's how I came to Heidelberg. I enrolled, studied physics, and... and then I... became depressed and lonely. Of course, it was related to my upbringing, m y childhood home, where important issues were swept under the rug. We still deemed ourselves to be a cut above the rest. I was socially rather inept when it came to building relations, and... I was really missing a girl in my life. That is, there were one or two, now and again, but... somehow I struggled with it, let's say. Many more arrived, just as I did. The papers reporting on the conflict gave the SPK tremendous growth. Simply because the demand was there, and no one was taking care of the people. The student movement in Germany became ever more critical of psychiatry, psychology and so on, back then. Psychoanalysis and so on, none of it was trusted. They were all people, jobs and professions, whose intention it was to normalize people. In that sense, visiting a psychiatrist or a psychologist was out of the question. That was out. You'd have considered yourself sick? Basically, I think gays and lesbians never really considered themselves sick. It doesn't work like that. I don't think I thought I was sick. I think very few did. I think there are gays and lesbians who had it drummed into them so much, that they were willing to somehow label it a sickness. I never believed I was sick, but it was a real problem. It was impossible for us to take the offensive, or to say, "Yeah, so what? What do you want?" Something like that. I was carrying so much weight on my shoulders, and suddenly it was lifted and I could sit up straight again and go on living. And obviously, the atmosphere with Huber was incredible. I mean, what he was doing was really marvelous. Instead of all the over-analyzing, "You're happy like that?" "Yes." "Then it's all good." Did you consult him frequently? - Yes, I asked if I could come back. Because then it was over. I could stand up and walk away. But sure, I wanted to finally talk. After 20 years of silence, I had someone I could talk with outside of my circle of friends. Then he said, "Look, we've occupied the house on Rohrbacher Strasse. You can't simply come for therapy sessions. You know? We're not a clinic or psychiatric hospital in that sense. We're this group," and he explained the SPK's history, and why they were at Rohrbacher Strasse. And he said, "If you want to get involved, you're very welcome." So I was like, "Sure, immediately, immediately!" And from that day on... I lived the SPK life. "Document 4515.1/78. Social Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Heidelberg, Director Prof. Dr. Dr. Häfner. To Prof. Dr. W. Hahn, Culture Minister of Baden-Württemberg. Heidelberg, May 11, 1971. Dear Minister, dear colleague Hahn, I am sending you a few pamphlets from the Socialist Patients' Collective that have been distributed in recent days. The tragedy is, in fact, that the mentally ill are relentlessly abused by this sect for the pursuit of their political goals and swindled out of the necessary treatment for their illnesses. Kind regards, your very devoted Häfner." Then the SPK grew so quickly that Huber said he couldn't do it alone anymore, that we had to socialize it. We had to... Senior patients had to look after other patients themselves. And I was counted among the seniors. Did you feel that, too, that you were experienced enough? No, not at all. But... it was just like any promotion: it's an honor, a challenge, and scary at the same time. I said, "Listen, I've no idea how." I asked him, 'Where did you get your knowledge?" We were naive, very naive. And he said, "Well... I got it from Hegel." I mean, of course that wasn't true, but what he meant was: he found a pillar of his thinking in Hegel. Then he said, "Go and..." No, he didn't. I bought Hegel books myself and started reading, then went back to him and said, "I just don't get it, it's way too hard." So we said we'd start with study groups. And so the famous study groups of the SPK began, where we read Hegel, sentence for sentence, and zoomed even further in, and mutually considered and interpreted what it could mean. And I still think today we came quite far. Through this work, this mutual helping and challenging, and... then also making the pamphlets to represent and defend ourselves outwardly, the team spirit grew ever stronger. We gradually developed a sort of pride for our theory. Which later suddenly became, or rather evolved into a sort of dogmatism. '71. The year of my son's birth. Professor Müller, who delivered the baby... I had boots on and all, and he said, "Now go out and beat up more students." One student followed me, saying he wanted to be arrested, too, else his fellow students would think he hadn't really been fighting. So we did. We cuffed him, took a photo and let him go. A customer-friendly approach. Shall we go out on the balcony? - Oh, sure. This is where the SPK resided with Dr. Huber and his troops, at the bottom, on the ground floor. We didn't know the exact rooms until after we'd searched the place. But that was the only entrance to the house, so obviously those visiting the SPK would also use this door to leave the house, or enter it. But they were also keeping an eye on us. So, later during the search, we found lists of license plates of police detectives, and photos of individual officials who were active in the investigation. So there was mutual surveillance. That was bound to happen, given the proximity of their apartment and our station. We were connected with a freelance journalist, and we allowed him to take some photos from up here. And over a few days he shot a whole series of photos, in which there were also some later RAF members. Then he sold these newsworthy photos to the Spiegel, Welt and... TV stations, because the group members themselves hadn't been in the public eye up until that point. The German Federal Police also used the photos for their wanted persons search, right? Yes, the photos used on the wanted posters generally came from Heidelberg. DARE TO BE WISE Well, do you know everything worth knowing from the press? Professionally? Do you know everything worth knowing about my personality from the press? No! - No? All the better. "Professionally unqualified." "Not a psychotherapist." "Unmedical practice." Louder! I repeat: I'm not a specialist in neurology and psychiatry. Yet, in the last five years, as it's termed in the field, I've "diagnostically evaluated" and "treated" 500 patients annually. My conduct is unworthy of a doctor. Because I treat 1,800 patients annually in extended and post-treatment. As you all know, I understand nothing about group therapy. This can only be the result of four years of leading three group therapy sessions a week, each of two hours. As a scientist, I'm a slouch. During the first two years of my practice in psychiatry, I persuaded around ten patients per week, especially third-class patients, to receive electroshock therapy. What? - And then administered these. Ugh, devil! A good while before I began practicing psychiatry, I'd already learned that in clinics for the well-to-do who could be charged 500 DM per day, electroshock therapy had long since been abandoned. Although the illnesses are the same as those of our third-class patients. When you listen closely, he sounds very hurt overall, doesn't he? How he describes himself, stating all of his achievements and simultaneously framing this basic conflict. Is that... What's your question? - If my judgment is accurate. That he was hurt? - Yes. Yes, of course. They call it "à fleur de peau" in French. I can't translate it. This changed abruptly as I tried to get my superiors to understand the socio-political context of this production process. I was free to go to East Germany, senior doctor Blankenburg told me. Yes, hurt and not entirely self-confident, and therefore the tension is heavily tangible. ... to devote my life to serving humanity. I'll practice my profession with conscientiousness and dignity. The first question is if you have a need, within the given circumstances, which are defined, by teachers, pastors, neighbors and others. Does one need to assimilate to these conditions, or do you permanently have an inner, admittedly unformulated, but noticeable resistance that you live with. To this end, we were out to find a fundamental contradiction long before this. We really looked for it. And then came the house occupation. In this respect, the SPK, coming from the other side, also reassured us, by saying, one needn't meddle with the individual, it's the whole system that should be questioned. And nobody was saying to anyone, "It's your own fault," rather, "Let's search together, we're in solidarity with you. It doesn't have to do with you but the circumstances in which you live, with which you may struggle." So it was the circumstances, not you. It was the fundamental approach of solidarity that's disappeared today. For me, that was the strength of the Socialist Patients' Collective, and that entire period in general, back then. When I arrived here in Italy, I was very restricted, very limited by the situation in Germany. I couldn't have done anything after jail and so on. But once I'd arrived here and people welcomed me, and... asked what I wanted to do, helped me find a room, and how about starting a living community with eight crazies, and volunteering together with four other colleagues? To take eight patients out of the madhouse and live together. "Yes," I said, "of course." And from that moment on, I never stopped, after that first responsibility and so on, I never stopped working again. Today, this building is occupied by the drug service. And the upper half of the building is unoccupied, it's empty. Both of these departments were hell. They housed the patients who after four weeks... You were in the outpatients' department, and if you were discharged after four weeks, then okay, you got out. But if after four weeks you weren't discharged, then you were committed and deprived of your civil rights. Automatically. After four weeks. Then you went from there to here. And began climbing the mountain. At the same time that the reform process began here, they were shutting down the madhouses in America and dumped the patients in train stations and on the streets. But we were always opposed to that. Basaglia wasn't an anti-psychiatrist. Basaglia was a psychiatrist who insisted on another method of psychiatric practice. But not to abolish psychiatry altogether. And that was certainly a very distinct breach with the philosophy of the SPK. Huber said, or the SPK said, "In terms of psychiatry, Basaglia's policies are the last mystifications of capital. He's rescuing psychiatry by means of a humane approach to the problems." Because it then continues as an institution? - Yes. There's a saying in Italy: "If you're stuck, then change your position." So move to another side and view it from there, maybe then you'll get an idea. The premise of starting change is to grasp that people who are put in a madhouse, are people who are in a madhouse. So it's the madhouse you see. More so than the people. In other words, the patients are characterized by their interned status to such a degree, especially after a long time in there, that you no longer recognize who they are. They are the madhouse. And the significance, let's say, apart from this playful effect, of taking people out of the hospitals to go on excursions or leave town, is to discover who they are. Because naturally, the psychiatrists were convinced that they were engaging with the actual individuals. Basaglia said, "With interned people, with prisoners, there can be no therapeutic relations. There's only a power relation." So you can't practice therapy in a... situation in which one person is entirely powerless, and I am God. HEIDELBERG POLICE ARE NAZIS We had a unique attribute, which was post-fascism, the post-war situation that we encountered. Filbinger, for example, was a known Nazi judge. Then during the SPK era in Heidelberg, a professor of internal medicine was also exposed by the student movement to have been a euthanasia doctor for Hitler. And without post-fascism, I don't believe the RAF would have existed. So it was a very, very significant moment. Our attitude was: We can change the world. Whatever the cost would be, was irrelevant to us. POLICE CHECKPOINT Another interesting point: here you see a transition, the beginning of the Baader-Meinhof era. Colleagues were wounded and shot dead. It's about quick access to the weapon. Until then we only had a pistol pocket and the transition to the holster. Today, we only have holsters, no pockets. Obviously, the one with the revolver was much quicker, with the other still unbuttoning the pistol pocket, and the deed was done. Then we started acquiring holsters and still do today. This is a Walther PP Su, a gun... caliber 9 x 18. Below is a silenced one, a relic from the Baader-Meinhof era. It fits. This is a Heckler and Koch sub-machine gun, model MP5. I must add, the RAF star features an MP. Previously it was falsely assumed to be a Kalashnikov. But it's actually an MP5. Obviously, the RAF gravitated towards this gun, because we, the police, were the instrument of oppression, and the MP5 was our tool as police. These were the wanted posters, which all police officers on patrol and detectives carried. I know the majority of these people. During the early Baader-Meinhof years, they were visitors at the Stammheim prison. The better part of them later went underground. We took many of them into custody first. For the medium formats, things look bad. I read about a so-called inner circle forming... You were invited. You were invited for the initiation. Mostly in the context... of individual therapy or a "single agitation." You were invited by Wolfgang Huber: "Come and join us for dinner this evening." How frequent were these meetings? Every week. - And how many took part? There were... let me think. Three. Three. There were six, seven, eight, nine, ten. It was quite clear. Whatever was discussed in the inner circle should never be discussed elsewhere. Not even with SPK members. The objectives were to use these technical tools for political ends. This one here. The Zenith 3 M. I bought this one during the SPK era, with interchangeable lenses. This one. So we were able to capture people or alleged agents of the Protection of the Constitution at least in a picture. And when such a person then met with someone from the dean's office or from the university's top management in the street or sat in a café together, then it was swiftly photographed. "Document 37 JS 1395/71. Heidelberg Police Authority, Criminal Investigation Office. Facts of the case: On June 24, 1971, around 03:10 a.m., police officers Brand and Kohlmüller inspected the driver of a Ford 1 7 around 57 Main Street in Wiesenbach, near Heidelberg, where Dr. Wolfgang Huber resided. During the inspection, the driver escaped and ran behind a live fence, left parenthesis, hedge, right parenthesis, where he vanished. Officer Brand moved towards the backyard. From close to the hedge, shots were suddenly fired at him. Before he reached the hedge, a further shot was fired, hitting him in the right shoulder." Where is it? Found it! It's all here. "Mystery concerning Wiesenbach gunshots." That should be "cumshots," right? That's how I showed up in Heidelberg. And then I... They only ever read Hegel. And did you read with them? - No, no. But they later started that in Berlin, too. Pictured on the right: "Who knows this man, and who saw him on June 24 prior to his arrest in Wiesenbach?" Didn't you find this in the archive? But you weren't alone, weren't there three of you? No, I've forgotten about all the others. No one knows who pulled the trigger. But what happens these days, if three exit the car and one shoots they all get attempted murder, or you snitch. WIESENBACH SPORTS CENTER This photo shows the manhunt teams, uniformed police, the FBI, riot police... In reality, our presence was much larger. Because the perpetrators were suspected to be on the run on foot, helicopters were naturally also employed. And I believe from the beginning, and this wasn't a myth, but was their conviction, they wanted an overthrow, they wanted revolution. And I've also found the smaller these circles become, the more closed off they are, the more the same arguments are woven into the fabric. It's basically a voluntary brainwashing. These people are then lost. That's also expressed in the language. Between '75 to '80, I was Head of State Protection in Heidelberg. We were also in contact with the manhunt for the second generation of the RAF. We were wiretapping. And this vulgar language, this harsh language... In the beginning everything was half-baked: Hegel and Marxism, etc. It gave you a headache after two sentences. And later, the language became really crude. To me, it was a kind of signature tune for those in the underground. "Results of witness interviews: About a minute after the series of shots, witness Siegfried B. watched from his balcony how a male figure swiftly jumped over a fence to enter Dr. Huber's property. He then disappeared between the house and garage. B's neighbor, Mrs. Annerose V., observed that the kitchen light in Huber's house was on. She heard a door in the house close. On the next morning at 7 a.m., witness Paula I. observed from her kitchen window Dr. Huber's car driving suspiciously slowly past the house. The driver had a cigarette in his right hand. Dr. Huber is supposedly a non-smoker, and usually drives rapidly." And "Shorty" Mährländer was on the run at the time? Yes, Mr. Mährländer was arrested in the woods over there. And what was found on him? We found falsified I.D. documents on him of another SPK member. And this SPK member was found in possession of a gun, among other things, that was used by the RAF for bank robberies in Kassel. "Police surrounded Dr. Huber's property at 9:10 a.m. At around 1:45 p.m., Dr. Huber left his house and was taken into custody." "The stone that is thrown at the command center of capital, and the kidney stone with which another suffers, are interchangeable. Protect yourselves from kidney stones!" I'm sure you've read that already. What did you think about the phrase, "Turn illness into a weapon?" I turned weapons into illnesses. Excuse me? - Totally ill. Ultimately, only document falsification was left. Because of the ID. The falsified papers? I even registered with it in Heidelberg. That was document forgery, I messed up. Besides, in the student movement we always said, "Do your time and shut your trap." Half of them never kept to that. They always wanted to make a statement. And that's how you give yourself away. Even though I enjoy a chat, I always looked for an angle in the room, squinted and occasionally slapped my thighs, "Oh, that's wonderful!" And in 22 months, not a single statement. Who can manage that? But they were always closing in and thought they could get to others through me. It's tough when you're six foot and six inches tall. You can't do a bank. You're screwed when you're 6'6". You're always on their radar. ENCOUNTER AT THE DARK CRIME SCENE POSSIBLE RECOGNITION OF SHOOTER, CONNECTIONS TO CRIMINAL GROUPS It was alleged that there was a workshop of explosives technology, photo technology, etc. Yes, well... That's all true. That all had to do with the resistance, and that the distinction between the RAF and... Marx' mechanics of revolution, wasn't... clear, for a long time. Some insisted on the production of explosives. Others, like me, thought we'd have to intercept police radio and so on... And so we attempted technological... But, honestly, nothing ever came of it. But fine... We tried. But I believe explosives were produced. And there was an attack on... the gateway of a state psychiatric hospital, but I didn't catch much of that. I wasn't a part of it. I was occupied with... or... felt obliged, of course, to participate in the workshop, as a physicist, which consisted of two people. Radio technology. I'd have been better off with Hegel. I guess. So, I left the SPK in the spring, after... this inner circle, in Wolfgang Huber's kitchen, was paid a visit one evening. Pretty dramatic. The evening continued as usual. Then the doorbell rang. Mrs. Huber stood up, answered the door, and returned in the company of a man. He was warmly welcomed by Wolfgang Huber also by two or three others. Then he began lecturing us about something in terrible political mumbo-jumbo. And concluded with the words: "It's time to take up the armed struggle," and slammed a sub-machine gun on the table. He had it with him? - Yes. In a black briefcase. No, I don't remember sub-machine guns on tables. Or strange men, really. I know photos that were found picturing air rifles, but... Air rifles? - Yes. Air rifles! - Yes, really. What kind of overthrow is that? No. No, I think what Huber was saying, from what I remember, let's say, that the fittest and most militant and so on, and who intellectually were the most fit, if you will, those he included in a circle. I was one of them and thus spent time at his home. But I think we were in his house five times? Four times, I don't know. It wasn't so systematic. I can't remember. But then I was meant to do something that I knew was supposed to be for the RAF, to help achieve this and that. And I felt obliged to help them. What did you help to do? - I'd rather not say. Despite it being so long ago? Today, the SPK is something entirely different. The part of the SPK that is worth preserving in the Hegelian sense of the word, doesn't have much to do with the RAF. I believe. But these were two parallel attempts. And therefore they overlapped in part. But we occasionally had as much of a... rattling rhetoric as the RAF had, ours was just as pre-packaged at times. Maybe also a bit Stalinist. We had that, too. And the slipping... Well, maybe at the start, we were something akin to a grassroots democracy, and slowly began slipping more and more, or kept changing further into something dogmatic. Maybe a rather interesting story, to the extent that pressure from the outside contributed a great deal to that. He was highly skilled. And his patients noticed that, of course. They needed that, learned from him and thus stood by him. When compared to others, it was like day and night. That the university hospital never managed to win them back... That was the hospital's big mistake, that they didn't succeed in that. Because there was a lot of good work and intelligence, and just a hint of zeitgeist that sometimes overflowed, but it should've been achievable. But they didn't want to. Probably because they were too narrow-minded. Or because they didn't want the trouble. It just didn't suit them. And everyone paid for that in their own way. Everyone. Ah yes, this is the raid that took place at 6 a.m. Here. This is the one. Probably, but we're still missing two vehicles. Namely: cells 131 and 232. Understood. Over. We just watched what was happening. Like here, when the police were lining up. We expected them to march out of here or there. Was anything found in the raid? Lots of things. Stuff that wasn't OK. Then they found the ammunition. And on that same morning... Here's an undercover officer coming out, after confiscating a rifle. We have concrete evidence, that a number of members of the Socialist Patients' Collective have formed a criminal organization. And this is the press conference exhibiting all of the weapons. All the guns that were found, and so on and so forth. These are the pistols and all. How did you find out about it? We received a call. From the police. It was common for the editorial department to get a call, telling us to get moving. Would the newspaper's conservative reputation have anything to do with that? Yes, it would. And our boss at the time, Dieter Haas, often called me at night: "Go after such and such tomorrow morning." Because he knew I'd keep my mouth shut. STATE COURT "Document Nr: X, 4350, Huber/5. Sender: Minister of the Interior, Baden-Württemberg. Stuttgart, August 11, 1971. To: Prof. Dr. Dr. Hahn, Culture Minister. Dear Colleague, Dr. Huber is now in custody. As soon as facts are discovered in the preliminary investigation that reveal an unworthiness or unreliability for the exercise of the medical profession, it will be determined if the suspension of the license to practice is to be ordered. Kind regards, Mr. Krause." Don't be scared... Quiet! Not so slow, walk faster. Markus! Fresh meat has arrived, Markus! Fresh meat! When was this block built? The Stuttgart detention facility was built between 1959 and 1963, and after four years of construction it was opened in 1963. Behind us is the honeycomb structure. At the time, it was Europe's most modern prison. It was built to implement the greatest possible separation of inmates, which is reflected in the mentioned structure. Simply to separate inmates from each other. Maximum security was paramount here. And to complicate communication. - Yes, to inhibit communication. Which provokes absurdities, as you can hear. We're being watched closely, hence the friendly heckling. Can I say hi to my girlfriend? Sweetie, I cheated on you, forgive me! "Inmate file: 8/742124, volume 1, page 398. Stuttgart, July 4, 1973. The undersigned has just contacted the Head of State Protection of Karlsruhe, regarding the planned visit of the Stuttgart newspaper. It has been agreed to that a one-hour visit will be made in a standard visiting room. Photographs are permitted. Officer Friese will supervise the visit. The gentlemen are granted an accompanied view of Dr. Huber's cell, but photos are strictly forbidden. Facility administration. Signed, Mr. Fraas, Senior Director." It all seems much friendlier than my dim memories of it. And here's the visiting room. Yes, I recognize this. I recognize this well. In its bleakness. And the grids up there. We sat here and talked with Mr. Huber. This is the interview that my colleague Jürgen Scheibe and I conducted with Mr. Huber. We sat here. With Huber right across from us, of course. He seemed very focused. Very alert. Very willing to engage in this conversation. The most notable thing from our conversation was how he described the effects of solitary confinement. He said, "At some point, you no longer recognize your relatives. I no longer recognize my wife. I no longer recognize my children." So a mental deformation that damages you to the core. Even just by looking at his hand, the hand and fingers, and how he's insistently talking to us. And the fist on the other side. If you wish to interpret the fist as such. The paper gave the story at least half a page, which was actually quite a lot. He described his prison life, "Cell 109. 'S' for 'Special Ward.' Thermos on the table. Cord hat on his locker. The well-known Dr. Huber parka hangs on the chair. No pictures or photos on the wall, a dull mirror above the shaving brush, a radio on the bed that he sometimes uses to jump over the jail walls, when he listens to Radio Tirana." It was unusual that he... didn't give any interviews if possible and avoided them later at all costs. I think that would have to do with the newspaper's relationship with the law firm, through many other colleagues, too. There were many trials in which the firm Croissant and Lang was involved. He might've done it for that reason. It certainly wasn't Huber's decision alone, It probably wasn't Huber's decision, but that of his lawyers. Croissant, if I remember correctly, wanted to build a press office of sorts, because arrests were already becoming more common. He wanted to publish regular messages concerning his clients or their circle. And so he met with several journalists in Stuttgart to see if they could imagine establishing such a press office. He asked me, too, but I found it absurd. You know, you don't start a press office for terrorists or whatever. Why are there so few photos from then? Because we didn't take photos. - None at all? Absolutely not. Didn't you have a camera? - Yes, but our focus was politics, nothing else. No family photos? - No. There's nothing from that time. I don't have any, I'm sure. I found these... body searches humiliating. Especially when you had to undress. It's not so funny when a... white towel is laid out, with "correctional facility" written on it. You were allowed to stand on it, so not to be barefoot on the floor, since you had no shoes on. I won't mention any further details. It was truly humiliating. Unimaginable today. - I don't believe that it is. If you represent any terrorist group, then I would think if you're not one of the really big, reputable lawyers, then you're just as much of a target as we were. Any don't forget that the propaganda against us was extremely efficient. There was always talk about us providing the link between the underground and the clients. No press release helped suppress that view. I mean, nothing ever helped the SPK either. There was no inner circle. The inner circle was construed. And the leader, Huber. The Huber couple was also construed. You have the complete SPK volumes. The info volumes, yes. "SPK Info." Here's the last pamphlet I got from the SPK, as I already described. It was handed to me at the SPK headquarters on July 13, 1971. Heading "SPK" is crossed out for "RAF." "If we are surrounded, we vanish. We will survive, because we fight back. Our habitat is the people's war. If there's no more space, we bulk up or go underground. Whoever wants the SPK can enter. We won proprietary rights. Whoever wants these premises, had better stay outside. We risked our lives for proprietary rights, and for no other price will we give them up." Who's willing to bell the cat? The SPK's doors have been closed. We have the proprietary rights." Awful. How was it for you to join the RAF? I was close to them. There were many who... I remember... I have it here, coincidentally. The podium discussion. Ströbele was there. 20 YEARS AFTER ULRIKE MEINHOF'S DEATH He said he knew many people back then who are in established positions today, who traveled to Holland and Italy to buy guns. They didn't use these guns, but that was the climate back then. For me, too. Do you remember the documentary when Rudi Dutschke stood here and said, "Holger, the fight goes on?" I remember it clearly. Schily was next to him. Schily and Dutschke. We were standing somewhere over there. 42 years ago. When you're here, standing next to the grave, you feel inside: We don't forgive the other side for our dead either. "Telex No. X 59, September 23, 1971. Members of the former SPK in Heidelberg were ordered by Dr. Wolfgang Huber to search for stored explosives in quarries around Heidelberg that could be broken into. Because it hasn't yet been determined if this group has already stolen any explosives, please let us know if any such thefts have occurred in those areas that haven't yet been cleared up. Sender: Baden-Württemberg special police force on behalf of Criminal Commissioner Textor." "Don't play with the dirty kids." You know that? - Yes, "Don't sing their songs." "Don't sing their songs." Can you sing more? "Head uptown, do it like your brothers." That's all I know. Of course, you have to know: criminal organization, conspiracy, in America they call it "the government's darling." Why? Because togetherness leads to everything being apportioned to everyone, which is actually contrary to our legal tradition. When we assume guilt, it's always imputed to an individual. The concept of conspiracy, criminal organization, naturally facilitates the evidence. If one makes a statement, it applies equally to all. Here, one person made a statement, the chief witness Bachus, but his statements didn't have a great deal of substance. They'd obtained these guns and displayed them in public, like the Black Panthers in the United States, but that wasn't prohibited. And from this, their intention to start a people's war was deduced. Parallel to that, the Baader-Meinhof investigations were going on in which crimes had been committed, where a group existed, and where the body of evidence was just as complicated as with the SPK. Trial day: Court case of the former Socialist Patients' Collective. Erhard Becker reports. - The interesting aspect of today was summoned chief witness for the prosecution, Hans Bachus, a photo consultant, 29 years of age, who described very fluidly, one might say almost too fluidly, how he entered for personal reasons, seeking medical advice. He thus confirmed the accusation of criminal development levied against the SPK. This will advance during the process. Many thanks. Goodbye. It was absolutely a change of sides. You know, if, as Huber later said, I was to have betrayed the SPK, then there must've been something to betray. If there's nothing to betray, there can't be a traitor. He contradicts himself somehow. And there were only two or three trials where I really testified. A day later we handed ourselves in, we thought they couldn't do anything to us. We were still rather naive. So we handed ourselves in, and that was that. We were taken into custody and questioned by Textor and his comrades, quite harshly on occasion, I also learned a lot there. What were the charges against you? The inner circle had planned the revolution, thus threatening the basic order of the Federal Republic. And by doing so... They said, "We can prosecute you for high treason and you'll get 20 years." They really scared us. And that we wanted to overthrow the capitalist order, was true. We didn't exactly know how, and we had... As I've explained, we actually had an evolutionary concept. But... we'd already been going along with all the revolutionary rhetoric and... broadcasting it, hence, the charges weren't plucked out of thin air. I only know that from the police files. But there were indeed shots fired and there were indeed guns. They said I was recognized in a line-up, that much is possibly true. As it happens with the truth. I feel more guilt for these... revolutionary speeches that misled others to commit deeds, or contributed to others taking it further. I'm referring to Stockholm. What else would you like to know? I remember thousands of walls on which we wrote: "Every suicide is a murder of capital," but where, when, how? I know that we did all that. It's true that another SPK member and I joined the RAF, and that the RAF was an armed group. No doubt about it. The SPK were standing on the street shouting, "Baader, Meinhof, Mahler, that's our cadre!" And it was all Huber who came up with these slogans. And that's not a criminal organization. As far as I know, nothing more radical ever took place. Never. The first trial day of the SPK unraveled like a macabre play. Six of the defendants had not shown up, nor had their attorneys. The two main defendants, the Hubers, were carried into the court on stretchers, as was the defendant Siegfried Hausner. With a clenched fist, Dr. Huber sang a Mao song and refrain: "A people's war can expunge both capitalism and madhouses." "Document: KA 6/71, Page No. 417. The Attorney General, Karlsruhe, November 7, 1972. Of the defendants, only Mrs. Dr. Huber was present in the courtroom. Lying on the floor in front of the defendant's benches, she read a print. Approximately 30 militant APOs made up the core of listeners, who occasionally engaged in singing and chanting with increasing volume. A female student read aloud a manifesto that she claimed had recently been resolved, denouncing the alleged unlawfulness of the trial." Is the trial portrayed accurately in the report? Yes, all in all. But it can't all be portrayed. Not the volume. Or the faces. For example, they shouted, "Special judge Gohl," "Nazi Gohl." "Frank psychiatry as euthanasia," "Gestapo pigs." "Victors of the people's war." "Sympathizers took turns in standing up and shouting in the hall. The judge declared those causing further disruptions would be removed. As disruptions continued, individuals were forcibly removed from the courtroom. Each time, police commandos went between the rows and forcibly removed the disrupters." I wasn't at all insulted by that. You can't take it to heart. I was six and a half years old on January 6, 1933, as Hitler was elected. And I was 19 years old when I left jail. There wasn't anything Nazi. "Finally, the defendant Dr. Huber was carried in on a stretcher by uniformed police. A deafening roar came from the APO group. Mr. and Mrs. Huber, the two main defendants, fell into each other's arms. Police initially tried to forcibly separate the two. But sympathizers created such an uproar that the police gave up in the end." The defendants Dr. Wolfgang Huber, Ursula Huber, and Hausner took turns shouting, whenever the judge attempted to speak. The judge ordered that the defendants' shackles be removed. At one point, the defendant Huber hurled a radio battery at me. Let's just say, it was not a pleasant collaboration. Basically, this group's work was a little jihad. If the group doesn't... If people don't go along with it, meaning the philosophy that Dr. Huber had developed in the field of psychiatry, and which he and his colleagues couldn't successfully establish, because that's ultimately what caused the whole fiasco for Dr. Huber... So if colleagues, society and the community don't want it, then you start a people's war. Maybe it's this. "Brawl in Courtroom." I don't know who they're carrying there. "Ursula Huber leaps onto Judge's Bench." I don't even know when that was. The judiciary universally expects a certain amount of cooperation, otherwise the trial falls apart and can't be portrayed to the outside world. Criminal proceedings have a political function. They're supposed to, firstly, show what the law is and how society works, and secondly, show the frailties of society and what can't be legitimized. It's always about the interpretation of power, not the power itself, but the interpretation of power relations. From both sides. The judiciary behaved as if the SPK would overthrow the state, or could or wanted to overthrow it. Which is terrible, of course. While we kept saying, "But we need facts." There's the book by Cobler, "It's the Human Beings That Are Dangerous," which is a quote taken from a ruling by Judge Gohl. He says, "Don't bother with the facts, it's the human being that's dangerous!" Which is true, of course. Nevertheless, one must still incorporate the facts. Would you conduct the trial today the same way you did back then? Exactly the same. Without the shadow of a doubt. A much more difficult question than if we handled it correctly would be if we found the facts and the truth. What is truth? The age-old question. You're shamelessly lied to in every other trial. PICTURE NR. 11 PICTURES NR. 44 AND 45 It was said that Mrs. Huber was the one urging her husband to mobilize this overthrow within a very short time-frame. Which is completely absurd. How could a few puppets do such a thing? There were... The SPK had 500 members, and of those... 11 were charged in the end. Please tell me how that's feasible. It's quite ridiculous. The sentences passed, so the 4.5 years for the Hubers and Hausner's juvenile sentence, when compared to what was actually proven, were quite harsh. Extremely harsh. I mean, it wasn't even proven to be a criminal organization. It was a construct that from the beginning was built to take these people out of circulation. No doubt. To intimidate... and to restore the peace, which didn't quite work out. Who am I speaking with? - Commando Holger Meins. On behalf of the Federal Government, it has been decided not to concede your demands. Our decision stands, too. And what is that? It's stated in our declaration. We'll shoot an embassy official every hour, and if the building is raided, we'll blow it up. We won't leave before our demands are met. That's for certain. Freeing captives really isn't a Robin Hood story, but concerns the defense of yourself, to some degree. Following the death of Holger Meins, discussions were long underway about getting the prisoners out. They had fought their fight. The RAF emerged in 1970, and by '72 had more or less all been locked up. So they sat there in jail, under very harsh conditions, so we... of course wanted them out, because their fight was righteous. That was our position on that. So we occupied the German embassy in Stockholm and tried to free 26 prisoners, which was a failure... a complete failure, there were four deaths in total, and the Federal Government didn't budge. You have to say, it was an outright failure. The first embassy explosion occurred shortly before midnight. Within minutes, the side of the building with terrorists and hostages was ablaze. ... had the explosives gone off inside a room... We just wanted Stockholm. After Holger Meins' death, and after... the state had shown no willingness to compromise, we wanted to get the prisoners out. And so the "Stockholm" campaign ensued, which was... a huge mistake, you know, because you can't want to free prisoners while also shooting others. You can't do that. Moreover, it's no... You can't create a better society with such actions. But it was also a campaign that was very briskly organized, because we wanted to do it before the Stammheim trial. Swedish police say the terrorists jumped out of a window on the ground floor and hid behind nearby cars. They were unarmed and were arrested without resistance. "Inmate file: Dr. Huber, Wolfgang, No. 8/74. Stuttgart Prison: Briefing Commission. Ruling from December 21, 1973. Inmate Dr. Wolfgang Huber will be transferred to Bruchsal Prison. Dr. Huber's behavior in prison correlates with consistent self-isolation from the realities of life, both inside and outside of the prison walls. He displays similar behavior not only towards prison staff, but also towards visitors and his own relatives. The extent to which this behavior results from imprisonment, or whether it is a continuation of his tendency to self-isolate, is difficult to estimate. Should such behavior persist after release, successful reintegration into society is unlikely. A favorable prognosis can therefore not be made for the time being. Stamp of Stuttgart Prison. Signed, Dr. Schröter. Before the Karlsruhe State Court, Carmen Roll is accused of having belonged to the inner circle of the SPK and the Baader-Meinhof group. Klaus Donath in Karlsruhe. - The surprise of the trial came from the two attorneys from Heidelberg and Stuttgart, Eberhard Becker and Klaus Croissant, who made their first appearance since the trial began on May 8. I was arrested in February, '72. In Augsburg. With Thomas Weisbecker. The trials in Germany were relatively quick, I think after about a year was when it started. And there was no appeal. The prosecutor wanted a heavy sentence, but the court only gave me four years. What did the prosecutor want? - The prosecutor wanted 12 years or something. And then the court... I'm not sure exactly how it works, but in Germany... I think I got seven years. Which ended up as four, I'm not sure about the technicalities, but in any case, two criminal organizations, period. No crime or anything. Association to two. Why did you see no other way than illegality? Because I identified with the policies of the RAF. I did. I did. But I believe that Huber maybe had contacts... He protected himself... I don't know it as a fact. He protected himself from having to go. I think Huber had no intentions of getting involved in any of that. INMATE FILE: DR. WOLFGANG HUBER. "Inmate file: Dr. Wolfgang Huber No. 8/74 2124, Volume 2, Page 497. Report. Bruchsal, March 5, 1974. Today, Dr. Huber declined the visit of his mother Martha Huber, saying: 'As long as these pigs are around, there'll be no visits.' After shouting, 'To hell with those pigs,' Dr. Huber left the visitation room. As Dr. Huber made his way back, his mother reached out to hand him a cola. After explaining to him that drinks are only allowed during visitations, Huber furiously threw the bottle on the floor, where it shattered. Then I took Dr. Huber back to his cell. Note: Is the reported inmate mentally ill? Was he identified as mentally deficient by a prison doctor? Is he undergoing treatment or under observation? Prison warden Rausch. Signed, dated and stamped." For example, I memorized so many poems by heart. From Bertolt Brecht. He wrote wonderful love poems. Or I did mental arithmetic, walking up and down my cell. 14.8 times 22.3... in my head. Then I felt how gradually... this instrument of the consciousness, of the brain, of knowledge, which humans are entirely dependent on, otherwise we're not human, began to function effectively again. And in this situation, it isn't so simple to reflect on your own experiences. Especially because in solitary confinement, there's also a moment of extortion. We were supposed to renounce. Do you renounce or negate, or do you talk about certain errors that we made, that the RAF made, whenever it was, under these circumstances, or do you not? I was... transferred to Schwalmstadt. A jail in Nordhessen. Coming from solitary confinement. In the evening, the door opened, and across the way stood three old inmates in blue prison uniforms. And I'd never seen another inmate till then, because of my isolation. I greeted them. They stared back at me with blank expressions. The next morning I walked by the cells to get some water, and I read the names on the cells: Kaduk, Klehr and Erber. I'm not sure if any of those ring a bell? Well, Klehr was a medic at Auschwitz. Kaduk, there's a photo of him here at the German Resistance Memorial. A large photo of him standing by a ramp with a walking cane. That still gets me. I was told the confinement was loosened and I could watch TV at night with those three. "Inmate file: Dr. Huber, Wolfgang, Nr. 808 - 75 2124, no page number. Prison hospital, Hohenasperg. Record of the force-feeding of inmate Dr. Huber. Carried out on November 12, 1975 between 10:30 and 11:00 a.m. Inmate Dr. Huber was bound to a stretcher with straps over his upper and lower extremities as well as over his chest, and was taken to the surgical department. The inmate spat at and threatened the wardens. Initially, the doctor drew 20 ml of blood. After he forcibly resisted, his arms were held down by several staff members. Subsequently, the nasal probe was inserted. The inmate tried to bite the fingers of officer Schalk, who carried out the procedure. During the blood pressure and pulse measurement, the inmate's arm once again had to be held down by staff. Otherwise, the procedure went well, without any particular incidents. Signed, prison director Mr. Frank. State council. Note: On November 16, 1975, the inmate was no longer bound to the stretcher, as he now only resisted passively. I came here after four years in jail. My last experience and practice was with the RAF, not the SPK. In those four years, in prison let's say, the positions that the SPK publicly represented at the time... It was all pretty incomprehensible to me. Eventually, it was beyond me. I didn't really identify with it anymore. The Italian psychiatric reform says that psychiatry and madhouses are a matter of a country's social system, not a technical problem, not a professional problem. How you treat the disabled, people with serious difficulties and disabilities, as in mental disabilities and so on. It's about the kind of society you imagine and not a matter for the psychiatric field. There's a political responsibility for how society works, and how these people are treated. The problem is that this takes work and these categories don't work much. Basaglia once said, if you're a psychiatrist in a madhouse, then the patients don't sleep well. And when patients are no longer in the madhouse then the psychiatrists don't sleep well. You men are all crazy! Is your exhibition ready? - We just arrived. I mean, is the space ready? - Yes. Are they finished? - The cleaners are finished, yes. So it's clean. - They've wanted to set up since August. The women of '89 will be here. And the slum photos will be over here. You know there was that basement room where both men and women were. I'll put the slum photos here. I'll place the first spotlight in the first hall. Did you shoot a spot on Leros? - On Leros. You haven't seen that one. It's the same scenery. The man holding onto the fence in 1989. Before hall M, no, which one... hall 11. The one with the fence is stood facing outside, and now, on the same fence, there are refugees looking out. It's crazy. The situation is absurd. There are refugees on Leros? - Yes, it's a hotspot. They've fenced it all off again. They've locked the refugees in, directly under the sun, in front of hall 11, without a single tree. Where the iron cages are. We were there in August, it was 80 degrees inside. How many people are there? - When I was there, around 300. No way. - Children! Mostly children and women. She's eating with the cats. This situation has repeated itself. Refugees are there again. Exactly the same as before. This was all in the course of the reform. The fence has since been taken down. The madhouse in Leros was closed. She now re-visited it and discovered they've made Leros into a hotspot. The absurd thing is that the insane are now free, and they see that, where they once lived, there are women and children, and they are totally confused. So that was Leros. These aren't the worst photos. The exhibition only includes the bearable photos. What you've seen, what we've seen, was far worse.
