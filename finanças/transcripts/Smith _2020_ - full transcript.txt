(blues guitar music) ♪ Into that deep blue ridge ♪ - What you havin'? - You Chalky? - I am. - I was told that you could put me in touch with a good caterer. - Who told you that? - Donny sent me. He can vouch for me. - Got a name, partner? - Bruce. Donelson. - What can I get you to drink Bruce Donelson? - Beer. - Let me tell you a little story Bruce, about a friend of mine, just to give you a little context on what you're asking. Got time? - Yeah, sure. (electric blues guitar music) - [Narrator] You see, AJ was a cop for about 10 years. If you spent any time around him, you knew his only goal was to make detective. He passed all the exams, did everything by the book, but never got promoted. So he quit, became a private investigator, and a part-time bounty hunter to quench the eventual need for a thrill. But he'd soon find, mostly insurance companies hire private investigators, and workman's comp fraud isn't as fun as chasing a mystery. (soft jazz music) (dialing phone) (phone ringing) - Could you transfer me to Gary Powell? - [Gary] This is Gary. - I'm out front. Do you need me to come in? - [Gary] No, just sit tight. I was about to get out anyway. (knocking) That was quick. - I got three separate days of footage on that disc. Everything's detailed in my report. - Great work. This is why we hire you, isn't it? I'll call you with the next one soon. And cheer up sometimes. (traffic passing) - Criminal threats. It's the last offer we're putting on the table. - You're joking, right? - Not at all. Our smoking gun was suppressed. Plead to criminal threats, and you can walk away with two years probation. - We'll take it. - I figured you might. Hey, you mind if I have a word with a client in private? Off the record, of course. - Don't say anything. - Ease up a little, have a seat. - I'd rather stand. - Look, we have a video of you killing a man, point blank, execution style. You think it just disappeared on its own? Have a seat. (phone buzzing) Oh shit. I forgot, I'll be there in one second. We'll have to continue this conversation later. Loosen up a little bit. Go out and celebrate a miracle just happened for you today. (traffic passing) (soft jazz music) - Can I help you? - Yes, I'm looking for AJ Smith. - I'm he. - I'm sorry to drop in like this but I couldn't find a number anywhere. Do you have time to talk? - Sure ma'am, come this way. Excuse the mess. Have a seat. What can I do for you? (phone ringing) - Is there a such thing as a case that you will not handle? - No, I pretty much handle anything within reason. - And if I asked you to investigate a public official? - I don't discriminate. (phone ringing) - My husband, he's the Assistant DA for Haywood County. This is so embarrassing. - Look, I've heard it all. There's nothing to be ashamed of. - My husband is having an affair. And I'm pretty sure he's involved in some illegal stuff. - How so? - I pay attention. Strange people coming to the house, late nights. Strange phone calls. I even found drugs in his car once. He shrugged it off and said that he had left evidence in the car on accident. I just have to be sure. - You live in Brownsville? - No, he just works there. We live in Memphis. - So why come all this way? I'm pretty sure there's plenty of investigators in Memphis. - I don't trust them. I need someone neutral, someone that he can't get to. I don't think he's been to Jackson. I have a lot at stake here. Look, whatever your costs, I will pay it, plus additional, I just, I really need you to handle this, please. - I'll tell you what. I'll send out a few feelers, see if there's anything worth looking into. And if I have an inkling, I will take your case on full time. How about that? - Should we keep this off the books for now? I'm just afraid if there's a paper trail, he'd find out. - Don't worry. Just give me your number, or some way I can contact you, and I'll find the rest myself. - Sure. - I'll get right to it. - Thank you. (acoustic guitar music) (door closing) - So about what time was it, that you were here? - I think it was right after I got out of school, about three o'clock. - And do you remember what he's wearing at all? - No. - I gotta take this, go stand right over there. - Moss. - Moss, AJ. - AJ? AJ Smith? - Yeah, man. - I'll be damned, the legend himself. How you been, man? It's been what, four years now? - Something like that. Hey, where's Chalky hanging out these days? He still around? - Chalky. Yeah, Chalky. Yeah, he's he's still around. Straightened himself out. He's got a bar out on 70. - Hmm, heard that. Send me the address, I need to pick his brain on something. Aren't you in Jackson, now? - Yeah, I am, but I have some business your way real soon. - Whenever you do man, make sure you keep a low profile. Chief still remember his last time you two were in a room together. You're at the top of his shit list. - I already know. - I'll shoot you that address. Talk to you later. (muffled speaking) - He was over there. - Yeah? - Mister Ronald. - Let me call you back. What the fuck are you doing man? - I'm just curious about that conversation we didn't get a chance to finish. Got time to rap? - I got time to rap. What I ain't got time for all this fuckin' weird shit. Get in the car. - Ronald? (shower running) (door creaking) - Finally home? - Yep. - What'd you do today? - Nothing. - Well, I'm gonna go to bed early, it's been a long day. - Okay. (tense electronic music) (country blues music) (lyrics muffled) - [Narrator] AJ finally got a job offer that piqued his interest. But taking it, he'd miss out on steady corporate cash. He needed a quick money fix to hold him off, he just never expected it to sit right beside him. He literally couldn't believe his eyes. (country blues music) (lyrics muffled) (electric blues guitar music) (panting) - Hey. You're at home? (bongo drums) - Need some help? - You can drop me off. There's a gas station up here around the corner. Just up here. Just up here on your left. What the fuck are you doing? - We're just gonna wait here, just for a second. - Oh no, the fuck we are. Unlock the fucking door. Unlock the fucking door! - Wait, wait. Chill out, it's unlocked. It's open, it's open. Get this lunatic out of my car. (rock music) - Kick my door, or do anything, I'm gonna spray the shit out of you. - [Woman] Fuck you. - You okay? - No, I'm not okay. I can't keep doing this, man. AJ, I don't mind helping you out, but not if it's gonna cost me my job. - [Narrator] AJ had a friend that monitored the city crime cameras. Sometimes having that access made his job a little easier. He apologized, told him he owed him one, but desperate times, call for desperate measures. He needed the cash. Now all he has to do is collect it. (electric guitar blues) - Man, she sure was a pain in my ass. Where you find her at? - We sorta bumped into each other. - I sure appreciate it. - Any time. (car starting) (soft jazz music) (electric blues guitar) (laughing) - You're dumb. Get that motherfucker. The fuck asshole. (phone buzzing) Yeah. I followed him to some pink house. He stayed for a little bit, but I think he bought some dope from this dude from the east side. Other than that, nothing. Positive. (knocking on door) Hold on, hold on, let me call you back. Can I help you? (blues music) (crowd murmuring) (muffled speaking) - You want something to eat, or drink? - No, actually I came to take to you about something. - Okay. - You heard any rumors on Ronald Milton? - Ronald Milton, that dude at the courthouse? - Yeah, the prosecutor. - Rumors, I don't listen to the gossip, man. - Well, I do private investigation now. I'm trying to find out what this guy's really like. - Who told you I know something? - When I was a cop, you had scoop on everybody. I'm pretty sure nothing's changed. - You know, I never had a chance to thank you, what you did for me back in the day. You stuck your neck out for me. I appreciate that. I'll always respect that. - Don't mention it. - But Ronald Milton, he's a piece of shit. Word on the street is he deals with this cat named Rico. Blackmailing him for coke, and whatever he wants. - Is this rumor dependable? - Dependable. - And what is this about blackmail? - Rico supposedly shot this cat over a dope deal a while back. It was ruled self-defense. It wasn't self-defense. It was an opportunity. - Okay. Where can I find this Rico? - I'd suggest you don't go there asking questions. This Rico is the real deal. You have to finesse that situation, and I don't need my name attached to nothing. - Chalk, I'm not here to hang you out to dry. I know what I'm doing. - The car wash off Parker, more times than not, you can find him there. It'd be obvious who he is. - I appreciate that. - Any time. I take that back. Don't make this a habit. Come on. You owe me a rematch. (phone buzzing) - Hello? - Hi, I just missed a call from this number. - Miss Milton, this is AJ Smith. Can you talk? - Oh, Hey AJ, yeah, I can talk, I'm alone. - I just want to ask you a few more questions. I'm starting to notice some things. Can we talk in person? - Sure. Do you want to stop by the house? - That wouldn't be an issue? - No, he's not here. He's out of town somewhere. Something about a convention. Oh, give me a second, let me text you the address. You got it? - Got it. Look, I got my eye on something at the moment. As soon as I finish here, I'll shoot by. - Okay, oh wait a second. I just remembered that I've got somebody stopping by a little bit later. Why don't you just give me a call when you're on the way, and I'll let you know if the coast is clear. - Sure thing. - Okay. Hey, thanks for taking this case, okay? - Don't sweat it. I'll see you, soon. - All right, bye. (knocking on door) (knocking on door) - Hey, you knocking like you the motherfuckin' police. - What are you doing? Are you ready yet? - Motherfucker, don't rush me. Shit, I'll get ready. - Nana'd be flipping in her grave seeing how you got this house. - Jav, don't come in here with this bullshit. - What the fuck is that smell? - Your upper lip bitch. - Come on, you know we got somewhere to be. Come on, hurry up. - Okay, I'm getting ready. Leave me the fuck alone. - I'm gonna take a piss up in here. - Go ahead, shit. I'll be ready when you get back. - God damn! This don't make no goddamn sense. You got three days worth of shit in that toilet. - Okay, flush it and shut the fuck up. - The health department gonna come in here. You got fucking flies and everything flying around in there. How do you sit your behind on a toilet like that. - Hell, I do it every goddamn day, shut up. - Look, I'm gonna go to the gas station, and I'm gonna take a piss. You can call me when you get ready. - All right, I'll call you. Bye, bitch. Hell, trying to boss me around all the goddamn time. (electric guitar music) - Hey man, I need a little extra today. Some special plans with my lady. - How much extra we talking? - Enough for party time, baby. - Hey, yo man. I'm about to send somebody your way. Go ahead and give him two. All right. Go around the corner, red convertible. - My man. - This motherfucker. (birds chirping) Look, bro, don't sweat that, man. I hate that motherfucker, too. And as soon as I get a chance to hit that, I promise I'm going. Hold on. (birds chirping) Hey what you need, man? - I need to talk to you. It's important. - No, you ain't got nothing to say to me. - Let me talk to you about the man that just drove off. I can help you with that problem. - Yo man. Let me hit you back. (birds chirping) What the fuck you talking about? - The man that just drove off, the prosecutor. I know he got you on a string. I can help you cut it. - A string? Look here man. You need to get on up out of here with that. - Look man, I've been following this dude around, and I'm real close to nailing him on some shit. What he got on you? 'Cause I know you ain't dumb enough to be dealing with him voluntarily. - I know how he rolls. - All I'm asking is for you to point me in the right direction. Give me something I can nail his ass with. - What the fuck you supposed to be? - I'm a private investigator. I got a client that want me to put his ass down. I'm intent on doing just that. - Hey yo man, get in the car. Look man, I can't get in the middle of all this shit. I got way too much to lose, you feel me? Check this out. If you hit over there off Rich Road, it's a cat house over there. Pink two-story joint. - I think I know what you're talking about. - Yeah. Should be a red or green ribbon on the door. If it's green, go on up and knock. There's this mean ass chick that's gonna come to the door. All you gotta say is, Rico, that's it. Fuckin' lawyer. Yeah, he got a bitch in there named, Neveah. Yeah, got his mind blown. As a matter of fact, he's probably on his way over there now. Yo, Sherlock Holmes, don't cross me on this. (electric blues guitar) - Rico sent me. - Just wait right here. - Well can I help you, motherfucker? - Is Neveah here? - Oh, so we got particulars huh? And what makes you think she wants to see you? - I don't know, can you make her? - And what make you think I can make her do shit? - Aren't you like the bottom, or pimp, or something? - Oh so your goofy ass got jokes huh? - I'm sorry, I meant no disrespect. - Look sweetie, this ain't the 70's, okay? We run our own shit around here. And these bitches can come and go as they please. I'm just the overseer in this here establishment. Let's make that clear. So like I said if your ass ain't trying to spend no motherfuckin' money, then why you wasting my time? - Will you see if Neveah will see me? - Neveah is gone for the day. But my girl Mimi in the back. Maybe they can, you know, do the same tricks that you're looking for. - Sure, she'll be fine. - Take him to the back. Good day. - Hey, wanna come on in? (late night jazz) - So, how long do we got? - Usually an hour. I'll do an hour and a half if you tip well. - So what happened to your friend? - Who? - Neveah. - Acquaintance. Everyone assumes that. So was that really who you came to see? - I don't mean nothing by it. I was just referred to her. - Well, I don't think she's coming back anymore. - Seriously? - Yeah. She broke the number one rule. Never fall for clients. - Maybe he was a high roller or something. - I don't know who he was, but did you come here to talk or? (eerie electronic music) (traffic passing) (siren blaring) - Hey. You all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Don't worry. I got a special getaway planned for us. When we get back here, things are gonna be different. - Different how? - Nothing, just trust me. Let me show you a good time, you deserve it. - Yeah. - You were really looking forward to Neveah, weren't you? - Hmm? What do you mean? - I never had anyone to pay me for conversation. - Look, I'm sorry. You are a beautiful girl. No offense. - None taken. You know, honestly, I think that you need to find yourself a new girl, because this new guy has got Neveah's nose wide open. - Why is that? - Just by the way she talks about him. I mean, can you believe he told her that he will put a contract out on his wife for her? - A contract? - Yeah. Dude told her that if he put a contract out on his wife for her, would she leave with him? She didn't show up at work today, and Neveah's not the type to miss out on any money. I'll tell you that. Makes me wonder, did he do her? (phone buzzing) (footsteps) (acoustic guitar music) (birds chirping) - Jav, I don't feel too good about this. - I don't either. Come on, let's go. (doorbell ringing) - How did you get in here? - The back door. We need to go. - Why? - I'll explain later but we need to go now. (doorbell ringing) Let's go. (doorbell ringing) - So what now? What if he had a camera set up at his house, Jav? Set up just for us. Ain't that conspiracy or some shit? Look, we got played. This was a set up from the motherfuckin' jump. And now he probably got something to hang over both our heads. I ain't never been nobody's bitch, and I ain't about to start now. I say, we get rid of him, his wife, and anybody who might know something. And I think I may know just where to start. You down? - [Narrator] Knowing his client had a price on her head, AJ had to take her somewhere safe. But Ronald being a district attorney, he had ties to every law enforcement agency within each county in his district. Who else does he have on a string? AJ didn't know. So he couldn't risk anything at this point. AJ had to take her someplace out of reach. He knew the perfect place. (soft instrumental music) - What? - I need your help. - Stop beating on my door. - Jackie, please. - No, whatever it is it has to do with that heifer out there doesn't it? And my answer before you ask, is no. - A few days, tops. Jackie's gonna take care of you. She's a pit bull, but she has a softest heart I know. - But I left my phone and I don't have any clothes. - She's gonna run you into town later, okay? And as far as the phone, just lay low until I figure out what's going on. I have a friend in MPD. I give them a heads up, just in case people start wondering what's going on. I'll be in and out, and I'm gonna check on you, okay? And I'm not gonna let a damn thing happen to you. (sentimental jazz music) - [Narrator] For now, she's safe. And AJ had to move fast, because the next day, the hunt was on. (laughing) - These some stupid motherfuckers. (dark jazz music) (laughing) What in the fuck she got on? What in the fuck are you doing in this house? Oh. Y'all motherfuckers better to be telling me something I want to hear before I start poking shit in this bitch. What? - I need to talk to one of your girls. - You need to talk to one of my girls? Oh no, you can't do that. We can't do that at all. Talk to one of my girls, who the fuck you think you is, coming in my motherfucking house, telling me something, huh? Oh, we brought guns. Now when you say, girl, are you talking about some ass and titties. - Whoever he sees, I need to see her. - Oh she ain't here. That girl been gone for a while now. She ain't around here no more baby. - Where could we find her? - I'm sorry, say that again? - Where can we find her? - I thought that's what you said. Let's see, let's see. Now you can probably, this is just me thinking now, I'm not sure, but you can, you can probably find her in hell you stupid motherfucker. (screaming) Damn! Damn you! You shot me in my goddamn nice clothes. Of all the damn shit you could've shot, my shirt? Damn! Shit! This was on sale. You ain't gonna find no big bitches shit on sale, like I found this one. Fuck you! (gun firing) (yelling) You ugly motherfucker! You big Ed and Eddy looking motherfuckers. When I get up, I promise you, I'm fuck you up, motherfucker. I'm gonna fuck you up till I can't fuck you no more. Goddamnit You ugly son of a bitch, you looking down on me like I ain't shit. When I get the fuck up, you fat eye brow motherfucker you. You orthopedic shoes-wearing bitch, done shot me in my damn girdle. This motherfucker was 89 dollars. You stupid-looking motherfuckers. You just wait until I fucking get up, you too, goddamn. And when I get up, I'm gonna put on that jacket and that hat, you smooth criminal bitch. You potty meat smelling ass bitches. Fuck you, you big ugly bitches. - Let's get out of here. - What? - Nothing. Can you get used to this? - Getting fucked in a nice hotel? Beats the house, I guess. - No, you and me, together. Not having to hide it anymore. - I hear you. - You don't believe me? - Look, I appreciate all this, I do. All the gifts and the restaurants, no man's ever treated me as well as you have, but this is all temporary, and you know it. I'll let you feed me this fairy tale, because honestly I like to hear it, and you sound so sincere but, at the end of the day, you're a married prosecutor, with a reputation to keep, and I mean, what would happen to your career if this gets out? - You let me worry about that. I don't care what other people think. I'll go back to work in private practice if I have to. I love you. - And what about your wife? - Just know that, real soon, it's just gonna be you and me. (video game guns firing) (knocking on door) - Damn! Is you gonna get the door? (guns firing on tv) (dark jazz music) - No, sit down. Relax. I didn't want to interrupt anything. We are cool, right? We're cool. Dre, right? - Yeah. - I thought so. Dre, do you, do you know who I am? - Yeah. - Good. No need for introductions. I see you guys playing video games. Who's winning? - I am. - Dre, you were saying? - He's winning. - Okay. What'd you eat? - Wings. - Where from? - My cousin's joint. - One more time motherfucker, one more goddamn time. I didn't ask you a goddamn thing. Shut the fuck up when grown folks are talking. - It's a little spot up on Campbell. His cousin owns it. - Really? Man they sure do look good. You mind if I taste one? - Sure. - You're damn right it's good. Quentin, you want to grab one? - Don't mind if I do. Sauce, and everything. - Damn good wings. And Dre, I'm looking for Rico, can't find him. You know where we can find him? - The car wash. - Looked at the car wash. He wasn't there. - I don't know. - Can you help us, where he at? - Look, she ain't got nothing to do with this. She's here with me. - Hey, what about you? Know where he at? - I don't know man. If I did, I wouldn't tell you. - Pardon me? - Look man, I ain't telling you shit. - Okay. Okay. (gun firing) Come here. (muffled speaking) - What? - Please tell me you're not in town. - [AJ] What? - Okay, at least tell me that no one saw you leaving the brothel out on Rich Road, today. - No, not today. I was there yesterday, following up on something. What's up? - There was a shooting. One of the ladies is still in surgery. The girls who found her, described you to a T as one of the last persons seen leaving the house. - Are you serious? Is she okay? - I'm looking to upgrade to a homicide any minute, now. Look, AJ, I don't know what you got going on, but you've got to give me something, or I have to bring you in to give a statement. - Look, I'm on to something. Just give me a few, and I'll clear this up. - AJ? Son of a bitch. - Yeah? Hey y'all bring all the drugs. And I mean ASAP. Overreacting? Do you know who the fuck these dudes is, bruh? Well don't tell me to stop overreacting, because that's what the fuck I'm gonna do. Hold on. (knocking on door) (knocking on door) Fuck. - [Man] Rico? Rico, you're in there, man. Open up, let me talk to you. (tense electronic music) - Who's with you, man? - It's just me. - Let me see your hands. Now what the fuck you want, man? - Look, I need know where Ronald is. - Ronald? Man, fuck him. I got the Ross brothers to deal with. - Ross brothers? - Look man, I ain't got time for no damn history lessons. Now what the hell you want? - Look, someone shot up the pink house, looking for the chick that's with Ronald. I need to find him. - What? Oh, that's some Ross brothers shit right there. - Who are they? - Quentin and Javelin Ross. Two of the most notorious motherfuckers this side of the Mississippi. Now they hitting up my damn spots. - Huh? - See for yourself. - This is crazy. - Yeah, tell me about it. - What happened to him? - All I know, is I left two people here. There's two people standing right here right now. But not the two I left in this motherfucker. I mean, come on man, look at all this shit, man. Blood and shit everywhere. And my neighbor man, my neighbor described the Ross brothers to a T. She saw 'em leaving when she pulled up. Man, I'm telling you man, these motherfuckers are mercenaries. I know these dudes put a hit out on me. I already knew it. I'm telling you man, I ain't going out like no bitch. - Maybe Ronald's wife wasn't the only one on the list. - What list? - Ronald hired a hit man. Think about it. You, and Bee. She already know how he met Neveah. You got dirt on him. Maybe he's taking care of loose ends. Let's get out of here. - How can I help you gentlemen? - [Javelin] Your brother around? Where can we find him? - I don't know where my brother is. - What about his wife? - Hey guys, if you're not here to shop for clothes, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. (phone ringing) - Who is this? Got a death wish calling me right now. What? Where? All right, you stay right there. You here me, you stay right there. Come on, let's go. (phone buzzing) - Hello? (frantic voice on the phone) Excuse me? Hello? (phone ringing) (phone buzzing) - Yeah, AJ. - Jackie, where's Angela? - The girl ain't come out of the room since you left. - Look, go check on her. You got to be kidding me. Okay, okay okay. All right, talk to you. (phone ringing) - [Moss] Hello? - Moss, is 112 Logan View in your jurisdiction? - [Moss] Yeah, why? - I got a weird phone call from a client, and I got a bad feeling about it. Could you send a unit over? - [Moss] All right, I'll put the call in. - Thanks. (tense electronic music) (acoustic guitar music) - AJ? Hey AJ? AJ hey? Alexander, can you hear me? Hey? Come on man. Shit. - I tried to wait on you, man. - Stay put, all right? You're trying to get up, don't be moving. Hey, come on. - What's going on? - AJ, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - [Narrator] Confused, would be a huge understatement at this point. - You can't afford an attorney- - [Narrator] But this supposed mix-up would only turn into a bigger cluster. - AJ, look, stop doing that, all right? Either you've got to talk, or you go back to the booking. Look man, I'm the only ally you've got here. All right? So just talk to me. Why'd you do this? All right, better yet. Why did you call me? - Shane, come on. You can't believe I did this. Do you honestly believe I'm that stupid? My head, my head is swollen. Do you really think I knocked myself out? - No, no you fell. You tripped over your shoes and knocked your ass out. I mean, you were still out cold when we got there. - I'm a big dude. Do you really think that little bitty ass table's gonna knock me out? - Well explain this. He was shot three times. Your gun was short three rounds. What about that? This phone, you recognize it? Whatever man, look. The fact is ballistic tests are gonna come back, showing your bullets inside his body. This phone, it's got all the texts between you and his wife, showing how obsessed you were with her. You're done man. And you know, what I want to know is, since I thought we were friends and everything. Why did you call me? The way I see it is you know, if you hadn't knocked yourself out, we never would have found all the evidence. You'd be sitting back somewhere laughing your ass off, and that's foul man, that's foul as hell. - Angela, you gotta find Angela man. She can clear this up. - We found her. She's here giving her statement right now. - Then why the fuck am I still in here? - Get up. (tense music) - Murderer! You murderer! - [Narrator] At this point, AJ is dumbfounded. He's so confused he's not confident of his own sanity. He was framed, set up, but why? He may never know. But one thing he did know, he was screwed. Charged with the murder of a prosecutor, he was held without bond for weeks. He was eventually granted bond, but it was so high, he may as well get comfortable in his new home. Just to think, life as he knows it could possibly end because of a lie. - [Guard] So, you made bond. - Thank you. - Don't thank me, it's an investment. - Investment? - Yeah, you're my best bounty hunter, and I need you outside those walls. - Look, my license is revoked until after the trial. I'm just a sitting duck. What's so funny, Mister Green? - Jackie called me, asked me if I could get you out. And that girl showed up to her house yesterday. - What girl? - The one that got you into all of this. - Angela? Damn Mister Green, what else? - She wants to come clean, but only to you. - Well, what the fuck we waiting on, let's go. - Look, don't rush me, goddamn it. Now I could have left your crusty ass in there. - Jackie? - Maybe they went to the store or something. - In what? Her purse is still on the table. Phone's on top of that. It's blood. - Well, I'll be damned. I'm gonna go get my gun from the car. (gun firing) (tense music) - [Javelin] He in there? - [Quentin] No. - [Javelin] Well come the hell on so we can dump this bitch. - [Quentin] So what about the other one? - [Javelin] She ran into the woods, Quentin. You got night vision? Can you track the scent, motherfucker? - [Quentin] Fuck you, Jav. (muffled) I wasted a tank of gas driving a country ass mile, damn near hit two deer, and now you telling me we just gonna leave this bitch? (Javelin muffled) Fuck! - [Javelin] Dumb ass really thought them high beams was gone help us see in these thick ass woods. We're not gonna keep chasing you. If you don't visit us soon, we start visiting family. Let's go. - Angela? What the hell is going on, Angela? Where's Jackie? - [Angela] AJ, I'm so sorry, I don't know how they found me here. But you gotta get me out of here, please. I'll talk to whoever, I'll do whatever, please get me out of here. - Get in. Hey Moss, it's AJ. Hey man, I'm on my way there with Angela Milton. I told you man, that I was framed. She's ready to come clean, so call me back. All I want to know is, why? I don't want no apologies. You could keep all that. I just want to know why, can I at least have that? - [Narrator] Ask and ye shall receive. Angela knew Ronald wasn't the same man she married. He became a con artist and an adulterer. At first, she only wanted to embarrass him, leak the truth anonymously to the news. But as she was snooping for evidence she found the files on the Rosses. Her anger towards Ronald turned a simple plan into a more sinister one. Totally unaware that a price was already placed on her head, she wrote down the address from the files and paid a visit. Quentin answered, and he was obviously suspicious. She explained how she wanted her husband killed, totally unaware of Ronald's arrangement. At this point, Quentin isn't sure what to think. Is this a freak occurrence, or one of Ronald's dirty tricks? They went as agreed to meet with her. They had to listen in case this was a possible out, an unexpecting, but not so innocent Angela, is pulled out of her home for safety, while the hit men can now only assume they've been set up. Eventually Angela would sneak out of a window, and find a trucker who would take her back to civilization. She knew she had to call them immediately to clear up a misunderstanding already in progress. The Rosses listened to what she intended to tell them before AJ interrupted, how she wanted to have her husband killed, and make it look like the private investigator she just hired was responsible. Angela had a secret prepaid phone. She used it to text herself in attempts to make Ronald jealous. This would create a perfect timeline to make AJ seem like he was obsessed with her. Knowing Ronald was on his way home expecting a dead wife, Javelin and Quentin lied in wait. She called AJ, knowing he would come in a hurry. AJ did, and walked right into the trap. Quentin planted the phone in his car has planned, while Angela sat in a local coffee shop, sipping coffee in front of plenty of witnesses as part of the final act. It was that easy. Or so she thought. She knew way too much for the Rosses to ignore. - Shit. - AJ? - What? - Someone is behind us. (AJ muffled) 'Cause I think that's them. (ominous music) - Just pull up right beside 'em. Come on. Go faster. (tires squealing) - Pull over, I know of a place we can go, cut 'em off at a different street over there. Come on, move. (dark orchestral music) (gun firing) (eerie electronic music) (door banging) (alarm sounding) - I don't feel so great. - Just hold on right here, okay? Just sit right here. (gasping) Are you hurt? - Uh huh. - Shit. - What is it? - It's nothing, just stay right here. We need the police here. I don't know where I'm at but I know I tripped an alarm. Somebody's after us. That doesn't matter, I got someone shot. Just send police. - Oh Angela, yeah I know. I know Angela. Angela, can you hear me? Where's your little friend, Angela? (alarm sounding) Yeah, it's scary. Now listen. Now listen. Quentin, what you got? - Nobody's in here. - Angela, listen to me. Can you hear me? What happened? Your little friend leave you? Huh? (alarm sounding) All right, let's go. Cops are coming. - What about her? - Just finish her. Come on. (gun firing) (sinister electronic music) (alarm sounding) (soft instrumental music) (siren approaching) (siren blaring) - [Narrator] An alleged killer out on bail, found with his victim's now dead wife. He was doomed. He had a friend from out of town, showed up to rub it in. - What's going on? What are you doing here? - You really can't keep yourself out of shit, can you? - Well, wasn't for the lack of trying, what? Come to throw it in my face? - No, I got your voicemail. - Well, she's dead, so, disregard. - AJ, you never ended the call. - What? - When you left your voicemail, you didn't hang up. Got everything. - So you got everything she said in the car. - Everything. Oh and Bee? She came out of her coma. Told us everything, too. - So why the hell you got me in this room then? Get me the hell out this room, man. I told you smedium head bastards I didn't do that shit. Got me in jail interrupting my lifestyle. Eating that plantation food. What the hell you expect? Oh, a hug? Oh, me telling you that I'm grateful? You know what? Fuck you. Get me the hell out this room. Oh yeah, you will help me get my car out the impound, tonight. Laughing and shit. - [Narrator] After that close call, AJ decided corporate work wasn't so bad. Anything else wasn't for him anymore. - Can I help you? - AJ Smith? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, I was looking to hire a private investigator for a personal matter? I can come back if this is a bad time. - No, you're good. Hold on, stay right there. Let me finish up. - [Narrator] And as much as he tried, he couldn't resist. - Damn, that was wild. So what's your point? You trying to tell me there's too much heat, or trying to let me know, no deal. - Just trying to show you how a simple coincidence turned bad, real quick. These guys, there's no such thing as too much heat. They will cater any event at any time if the price is right, but there is a risk, that's all I'm trying to say. - So what about your friend? It can't be over. - That situation is resolved as a favor to me. I don't know you. I don't owe you any favors. So if you still want me to make that call, you've been warned of the risk. - I understand. I still need a caterer. - Write down your name and your number. Don't come back here for any reason. If they want your business, you'll know. (electric guitar blues) (rock music)
