Since the dawn of humanity, We have asked the question, How did our wondrous home come to be? Today, space technology casts light on this mystery. Thanks to intrepid astronauts And data beamed from hundreds of satellites, We are gaining new insight into earth's epic history. Going to space, We have a different lens to look at the whole planet. We're finding fresh evidence To answer age-old questions About the formation of our solar system. We can only understand the big picture When we study all these bodies And learn everything they have to tell us. We're asking how life begins And how it evolves through times of peril. All of these stories Are intensely interesting murder mysteries In our planet's past. We're going on a 4.5-billion-year journey Through eons of fire and meteor storms, From the arrival of oceans And freezing global ice sheets, Through epic eruptions And mass extinctions, To where, against all odds, life finds a way. This is the story of the life of earth from space. 250 miles over our heads orbits the international space station. The astronauts who live here Constantly monitor the world below. Our vantage point from space Gives us a view of the planet That is about collecting information That can't be collected any other way. But they can also observe phenomena That provide clues to earth's distant origins, The countless tiny meteors bombarding our atmosphere. Every single day, There are thousands and thousands of pounds Of space rocks pummeling the earth, And it becomes very clear that we live in a neighborhood. It's made up of pieces of the universe, Some of which come crashing down onto our earth. As they enter the atmosphere, Most of these space rocks burn up, But those that don't Can help us understand where our planet came from. 50,000 years ago, A large meteor punches through the atmosphere. The impact site is today visible from space... Arizona's barringer crater. When the 30-ton meteorite hit, It exploded into thousands of pieces. At the national museum of natural history, A major fragment is on display... The canyon diablo, One of the oldest objects you'll ever see. Radiometric dating reveals its oldest parts Formed almost four and a half billion years ago. These meteorites hold in them A history of our solar system. They're sort of like fossil relics That have a story to tell about the birth of earth. It's a story that starts with the building blocks Of everything on earth, Elements that are forged in the hearts of long-dead stars. Under its own gravity, an enormous star collapses. The explosion creates elements like iron, oxygen, and carbon. The materials that we're made of, The materials that everything around us is made of, That earth is made of, these materials, these elements, Are created in the centers of stars, And so we are made up of the ashes of exploding stars. As gravity pulls on the stardust, It forms a hot, spinning disc. A new star grows in its center... our sun. Around it, hot, dusty materials clump together. These small masses will become comets, asteroids, or meteors, Like the canyon diablo. The largest of them become planets, like our own. The infant earth is born. Its surface is a hellish ocean of molten rock, And it's missing a crucial companion. For humanity, The moon has always been a source of wonder... A timepiece to chart the months and seasons. Modern scientists are also captivated By our closest celestial neighbor. For them, it is the moon's origins That remain the greatest mystery. Is it a smaller body formed in parallel with the earth Or a passing planet captured by earth's gravity? Nasa's apollo missions provided a unique opportunity To find the answer. December 1972, the launch of apollo 17. On board is dr. Harrison schmitt. On this last mission to the moon, Nasa sends their first geologist. 25 feet. Down at 2. Feels good. 20 feet. 10 feet. Engines stopped. Ok, houston, the challenger has landed. Scientists believe the secret to the moon's origins May be hiding in its rocks, If they can identify the right ones. My mission was a little bit different Because we built in some time for me, As a geologist, to look around And try to understand more than a pilot astronaut... However well-trained they might be, They didn't have the experience that I did. Let's see if I can't crack the corner And get that contact. We actually collected more than any other mission, About 240 pounds of rocks. With his carefully selected specimens, Schmitt hits pay dirt. These rocks prove that the earth and moon Are more than just neighbors. What those rocks showed is that the moon was made up Of pretty much the same stuff as the earth, And so that gave us the big clue that we needed To understand how the moon formed But also understand the early history of earth. It's now widely believed that the moon Is the remnant of a catastrophic collision. A newly formed planet the size of mars Heads straight towards the infant earth. From the molten debris, our moon takes form, The same size as it is today, but 17 times closer. It took a lot less time to orbit the earth, And it took a lot less time For the earth to spin once on its spin axis, So the day was shorter, the month was shorter, The week was shorter. The proximity of this large circling object Distorts the earth, causing a tidal effect in the rock. There was a gravitational interaction Between the earth and the moon that we call the tidal force, And that has the effect Of throwing the moon away from earth, So every day, The moon moves a little bit farther away from the earth Than it was the day before. Now, as the moon rises for the first time, Our planet begins to cool, And a crust begins to form. But before earth can truly come to life, It must survive another harrowing challenge from space. The moon's barren surface Bears the scars of the distant past. In 1972, in the rocks around their spacecraft, Harrison schmitt and the crew of apollo 17 See signs of an impact so intense, It melted the moon's crust. They'd landed inside an enormous crater 400 miles wide. We were in a valley Deeper than the grand canyon of the united states, So it was really a remarkable place to be. The crater is one of many thousands That dot the moon's surface, And analysis of apollo rocks reveal Many of these epic craters are truly ancient, Evidence that beginning some 4 billion years ago, The inner solar system suffers an intense bombardment. The major thing that we have learned Is that the first billion years of earth's history Was extraordinarily violent. Across hundreds of millions of years, The earth is hit by over 22,000 asteroids and comets From the outer solar system. Some are over 25 miles across. Each one inflicts cataclysmic destruction. What would that feel like? Constant earthquakes, Objects are streaking through the sky, falling to earth. You feel the ground shaking, Giant plumes of material being thrown up. That would have been amazing. There is lightning that's created in the plume of dust. There are rocks that are falling and look like they're on fire. There's going to be a lot of molten rock On earth's surface, as well. You think of darkness. You think of lava. You think of the smell of sulfur. As this assault continues, The earth's appearance changes. Water starts to pool on the earth's surface. It's thought that the comets bombarding earth Are laden with ice. This combines with water Leaching from the earth's own cooling rocks. The first oceans are born. With water comes weather. 1,000-year relentless storms of unimaginable ferocity. Every tide like a mega tsunami. The moon was much closer to the earth, And this means that the tides were much greater, So instead of measuring tides in feet, Tides were measured in kilometers or miles. 4 billion years ago, 500 million years after the earth was born, It has a moon, oceans, and weather. It is beginning to resemble the planet we know. For now, it is barren, devoid of life, But things are about to change. 2013, chelyabinsk, russia. A traveler arrives from deep space. It is the largest meteorite impact in a century. The hunt is on to find its scattered remains. Scientists pull a huge fragment from a nearby lake. They cut it open and make a fabulous find. The space rock contains primitive organic materials. It's the latest evidence to support a growing idea... That the same comets and meteors that carried water to earth Also brought with them the ingredients for life. 4 billion years ago, Auroras illuminate the infant atmosphere, The visual manifestation of the earth's magnetic field Produced by its molten core. It's a shield that now protects the surface From the ravages of space radiation. Beneath this shield, In shallow coastal seas churned by the tides of the moon, Fueled by volcanic heat And seeded with organic molecules from space... Comes the very first life on earth. Just how it begins remains a mystery. But at some point in this distant time, Chemistry becomes biology. For years, no one believed life could exist In toxic volcanic environments, But life is full of surprises. Today our planet is much changed, But there remain some environments Bearing similarities to early earth... Iceland, One of the most volcanic regions of earth. Just off its southern coast Lies an isolated volcano named surtsey. Surtsey is one of earth's newest strips of land. In 1963, it exploded from the sea, Erupting continuously for four years. It is now a world heritage site, Off-limits to all except a few research scientists. Surtsey's hot volcanic cracks and seams Closely reproduce the environment of early earth. The team drills cores of rock from hundreds of feet below. They search for the fingerprints of life, Marks made in the rock by deep-dwelling microorganisms. Despite temperatures exceeding 250 degrees fahrenheit, Without oxygen, and in acidic, salty water, The rocks are clearly scarred By single-celled organisms feeding off the rock. Scientists are now finding these extremophile cells In volcanic zones across the globe. It's mind-blowing, to be honest, Because the number of microbial cells found in this system Outcompete the number of stars in the universe. Dna indicates some underground microbes Relate closely to cells that were ancestors Of all life on the surface. It dawned on me at that time Just how important they are. These are the type of cells That evolved into a more complex cell structure, Which eventually turned into you and I. 3 billion years ago, Simple single-celled life forms are now colonizing the planet. The oceans swirl with blue-green cyanobacteria. These have now evolved To harness the energy of sunlight... Through photosynthesis, The process still used by modern plants. This revolution in energy supply has massive consequences... Because the byproduct is oxygen. Over the next billion years, Cyanobacteria turn carbon dioxide into oxygen In such volumes that the entire ecosystem alters. The crust of the earth and the oceans are filled with iron. As oxygen leaches into the system, This iron is transformed. There's lots of iron on the planet's surface, But it had never been oxidized before, So, fundamentally, cyanobacteria created oxygen, Which created rust, and the earth became red. By 2 billion years ago, The countless tiny microbes that fill the earth's oceans Alter the chemistry of the planet. But as it slowly evolves over the next billion years, Life will face a new challenge to its existence, As changes in climate Plunge the planet into deep freeze. 720 million years ago, Earth is set for an explosion of life, But for now, life remains primitive and rare, And some scientists believe they know why. Satellite and ground surveys Across a 2,000-mile stretch of northern canada Capture evidence of an ancient continent-sized volcanic field. This is the franklin large igneous province. Many scientists now believe It's the sign of a series of enormous volcanic eruptions That threatened life on earth by blotting out the sun. 1991, the philippines. Mount pinatubo explodes. It's one of the biggest volcanic eruptions of the modern era. Pinatubo pumps over 10 million tons of sulfur into the skies. Satellites later record a change In reflectivity of the atmosphere. So much heat energy bounces back into space, The whole earth cools by one degree fahrenheit. Imagine the impact of multiple pinatubo eruptions All going off at once. Northern canada. Across 2,000 miles, the earth tears open. Billions of tons of sulfur and ash clog the air. The earth plunges into darkness. The eruption continues for decades. Global temperatures plummet to minus 50 degrees fahrenheit. One theory suggests the freeze is so intense, The planet is encased in ice... Snowball earth... Entombing earth's fragile microbes beneath miles of ice For 80 million years. But eventually the ice thaws. Somehow, life on earth survives, And now it will thrive. Across the next 200 million years, New generations of bacterial blooms Raise oxygen levels again, Creating an atmosphere rich in oxygen. Looking at the earth, especially at sunrise or sunset, Which for us happens 16 times a day, Which is pretty wonderful, That's when you can really see That, that layer, that, that thin atmosphere, And it's like a little bubble That encloses everything you know and love. 600 million years ago, this oxygen-rich environment Is the catalyst for an energy revolution. Some microbes now turn from solar power to oxygen power. This new energy source is behind their evolution Into the first multicellular plants and animals. Today, off the coast of australia Lies the great barrier reef, An organic structure so big, it can be seen from space. Scientists believe ancient reefs were incubators for early life. They are among the most ecologically diverse places On our planet. Reefs are like cities. I mean, cities, you start with a few little houses. Then you get buildings and multi-story buildings. There's lots of diversity in a city, So in ancient reefs, there's just that same thing. The more kinds of places there were to live, The more diversity of life forms there were. In southern africa, Scientists have recently discovered What they believe is one of the oldest reefs on the planet. It was formed in oxygen-rich seas 550 million years ago. Evidence suggests this is a time of rapid evolutionary change. This is when the blueprint of modern animals, Of us, first emerges... The cambrian explosion. What we see are a bunch of new kinds of organisms. Now, these were marine animals, Small animals that looked like crabs and shrimp And other kinds of shellfish. These organisms had features that are quite familiar to us. If you look at a, a little tiny crab, He's got little eyes looking back at you. He's got limbs, and he crawls around, And he eats stuff through his mouth, And it goes into his stomach, And it goes out the back end as its waste. That sort of way of being an animal, We see for the first time in the cambrian explosion. Over 4 billion years, The earth evolves from a ball of fire to a ball of ice. And by 400 million years ago, to this... A blue-green planet With life spreading to the land. Pretty soon after you have the first plants on earth, You have the first trees on earth. With trees come forests, And with forests come the same kind of diversity of habitat That we've seen underwater in the reef structures. With plant life comes animal life. The first surface dwellers make their appearance. Life now has a foothold, Across land, sea, and the sky. But their new oasis Is a time bomb just waiting to explode. Russia. These are the siberian traps, An ancient lava field spread over 2 million square miles. In 2011, scientists here made a crucial discovery, Explaining one of the most infamous events In earth history, The great dying. This spot is the scene Of the most deadly volcanic eruption in history. This huge area becomes an ocean of fire. But the danger is not just the eruption. Scientists found the lava erupted Through a thick layer of coal, Generating a toxic cloud that acidifies the atmosphere, Leading to about a million years of deadly acid rain. This eruption happens almost precisely When we see a lot of things go extinct at the same time. The lava starts erupting, organisms start dying. We call it the great dying because by our best estimates, It's pretty close to snuffing out life on the planet. But not all life dies out, And the gaps opened up by the extinction Generate a monstrous surge in evolution... The age of the dinosaurs. Argentina, 2012. Paleontologist dr. Diego pol Uncovers the remains of what's thought to be The biggest land animal that ever lived. So large, its thigh bone alone stood taller than a human. The 70-ton titanosaur. Can you imagine 10 african elephants put together? You know, this animal was as long as an airplane, You know, a boeing 737. But dinosaurs were not always so enormous. 230 million years ago, The first dinosaurs appear on our planet, And they were tiny animals. They were probably weighing 10 kilograms. Now, 50 million years after that... There were the first giant dinosaurs. This is the time when titanosaur appeared And when they achieved the maximum body size, When we started seeing these 70-ton animals Roaming on our planet. It's not yet clear What caused dinosaurs like titanosaur to grow so large. But these enormous plant eaters Now become an important part of the global ecosystem. They travel hundreds of miles. They spread seeds and trample vegetation, Creating new opportunity for plant species To spread across the planet. We know these giant dinosaurs migrated From antarctica to asia to north america, africa. They were everywhere, Roaming through the landscape, Altering and modifying the different ecosystems All over the planet. It's really, really amazing. For 180 million years, As the continents slowly shift beneath them, The giant dinosaurs dominate the planet, But around 65 million years ago, Suddenly they disappear, wiped out by a meteor strike. Scientists believe another event May have contributed to their downfall. In india today, there is a collection of ancient temples. These incredible structures were cut from the soft rock Of the deccan traps, The remains of a massive lava eruption That spreads over 200,000 square miles of western india. This epic eruption begins to poison the dinosaurs' world. But the nail in their coffin Is the sudden impact of an immense meteor. Here you have a body of rock That's six miles in diameter. It's traveling at 20 times the speed of a rifle bullet. When it hits planet earth, Which is much, much, much larger, It's like driving a truck into a stone wall. And it punches a hole deep into the earth. And then all that energy gets blown back out of that hole. With a force of a billion atomic bombs, The explosion gouges a crater 115 miles wide and nearly 8 miles deep. But many now believe that the impact alone Wasn't powerful enough to cause their global extinction. Satellites designed to search for oil have recently confirmed That the impact site is a part of the earth's crust Unusually rich in hydrocarbons and sulfur. When the meteor hits, the volatile compounds vaporize, Creating a cocktail of climate-changing chemicals That mix with the countless tons of melted rock. All that energy blows up and out. Some of it goes out of the earth's atmosphere. Some of it blows sideways. Meanwhile the earth is turning, So you have hot stuff flying out of the sky On the other side of the planet. If you were anywhere near it, forget about it, But if you are on the other side of the planet, Forget about it also. Nearly half of global plant life dies. Half the life in the sea is snuffed out. Three quarters of all life on the planet is made extinct. The great dinosaurs' fate is sealed. Although they disappear from history, The catastrophe now creates opportunity For others to take their place. 65 million years ago... After the devastating meteor impact, Over thousands of years, the world slowly recovers. The air clears, The fires cool, And new forests take root. The great dinosaurs are no more. But some life has survived. The mass extinction that saw The demise of the dinosaurs Was terrible for everything on the planet quite frankly. Mammals squeaked through that extinction. They did not sail through it by any stretch of the imagination. There might be as few as 20 different kinds of mammals That made it through that extinction. But the death of the dinosaurs Really opened up a huge amount of opportunity for mammals, And they took it. They took the opportunity, and they went wild with it. On the northern borders of india Lie the himalayas, The highest mountain range on earth. Today its peaks rise five and a half miles above sea level. But by earth's standards, these mountains are young, Less than 55 million years old. This epic range rose in parallel with the rise of the mammals. 55 million years ago, after eons of continental drift, India smashes into eurasia. The himalayas begin their ascent to the heavens. Recent fossil finds in india Are adding to evidence collected worldwide That this is an evolutionary turning point. The precursors of many key mammalian species Are starting to emerge and spread across the globe. 10 to 20 million years after the dinosaurs go extinct, Mammals really explore the world And develop a huge range of shapes and ecologies That still define them today. You start to see the first real horses. You see whales moving into the ocean. You start to see early primates showing up. But it was certainly a pivotal moment in mammal history. For the next 50 million years, As continents continue to shift into today's positions And the himalayas inch upwards... The mammals evolve. By one million years ago, They take over the globe. And in africa, conditions are ripe For a new chapter in the history of our world. A new mammal will emerge, A new type of primate that walks tall, Who in a flicker of geological time Will become the dominant species on the planet. Next time, we'll explore the age of humans, Using clues from space to provide new insights Into why we evolved our unique human brain, How we tamed the planet's animals and plants To build great civilizations, And how we develop total command of the earth's energy, Giving us the power not only to shape our future, But also the fate of the planet we call home. Ever since humanity went into space, We've looked down on the marvels of our civilization. We've achieved incredible things, But we didn't do this alone. Thanks to space technology, we are gaining new insight Into how the dynamic life of our planet Has influenced the rise of our species. We're finding evidence that our exceptional brains May be an evolutionary response to an unpredictable climate. When you really look at what our brains do, They're our organ of adaptability. We're revealing how a lifestyle revolution Triggered the growth of civilization. These are probably the earliest ancient roadways In the world. And we're uncovering the full power and peril Of unleashing the energy stored within our planet Hundreds of millions of years ago. That's an energy revolution, And there are climatic and ecosystem consequences to that That are going to be present for thousands of years to come. Humanity's very success is pushing us And our environment to the edge. We have become a force to match anything that you see In a billion years of earth history. But our technology gives us a chance To shape what happens next. We can actually conceive of a desirable future And build a global plan to get to that future. That's the challenge for humanity in the 21st century. This is the story of us, Of the life of earth in the age of humans. From its birth 4.5 billion years ago, Planet earth has endured constant change... Devastating impacts from asteroids and comets, And tectonic shifts generated By the churning heat beneath its crust, Transforming the planet's environment. All life that clings to its surface Evolves to survive Or succumbs to extinction. Our story begins 300,000 years ago. Earth's climate is colder than today, With ice sheets extending from both poles. In the warmer equatorial zone on the african continent, A new creature arises, A species of ape with great potential. They are us... Homo sapiens. But 300,000 years ago, We were not the only two-legged ape Wandering the african plains. 2015, southern africa. In a region rich in ancient human fossils, A fantastic new discovery awaits deep underground. It's the first time Paleoanthropologist dr. Lee berger Has explored the rising star cave system. I had this map I'd created Of almost 800 cave sites That were all entryways into the underworld That I hadn't been in yet, and that was the mission. Berger has heard rumors of human remains Glimpsed down one of these passageways. It's challenging terrain for the scientific team. To travel just 100 meters Takes 20, 30, 40 minutes, Depending on how fit you are and how good you are At squeezing through very tight spaces. It's a torturous journey. The effort is worth it. They make an incredible find. I was speechless. I mean, there I saw something I thought I would never see in my entire career. There was a clearly primitive hominid Just lying there on the surface in the dirt. The body is just the beginning. Berger and his team uncover bones From 15 separate skeletons, Dating from the time humans first spread across africa. We've had everything from individuals just born, All the way to the extreme elderly, And everybody in between. But the bones are not human. They belong to a totally new species... Homo naledi. Imagine if you're standing out here 300,000 years ago. A group of homo naledis from 500 meters... They'd look very little different from humans Because they're walking on two legs. As they approach, You're going to start seeing things that are different. You're going to notice that the proportions aren't right, That the heads are small, that the shoulders are narrow. When they got about 50 meters from you, You'd realize that's not a human coming at you. There'd be no mistaking. Naledi now joined the ranks Of at least three other human-like species That existed in parallel to homo sapiens 300,000 years ago, Exhibited here in the national museum of natural history. We used to see human evolutionary history As that March of progress from ape-like to human beings. Instead, what we've learned is that there were contemporaries. Our evolutionary tree is branching and diverse, Like the evolutionary trees Of almost all other organisms on earth. But if all these human-like competitors Once shared our planet, Why are we the only ones left? None of them now exist on earth. We are the last bipeds standing. Humanity's survival advantage may have its roots In dramatic changes in the earth's unstable climate. Satellite images of the western sahara Reveal remains of a major river system 250 miles long... Evidence that this was once a lush valley. It's now believed that every 20,000 years Throughout humanity's evolution, Periodic ice ages swing the african environment From wet to dry and back again. The past six million years Have been the most dramatic period Of climate oscillation and change in landscapes Ever since the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Any species that can't cope With rapid environmental change will not endure. The boundary between survival and extinction Was really adaptability, The ability to adjust to changes in the landscape. Scientists think the need To solve environmental challenges Spurred homo sapiens to evolve a uniquely adaptive brain. We developed imagination and language skills Our rivals lacked. When you really look at what our brains do, They're our organ of adaptability. With language, we have the ability Of not just having our brains being inside our skulls, We have the possibility of our brains being shared with others In ways that go far beyond What any other organism was capable of doing Up to that time, including earlier humans, And that capacity to socially network our brains Meant that innovations could start to not only be invented But also to accumulate. That was our real card That we could put down on the survival table. Over 200,000 years of intense competition In a fluctuating climate, We become the only homo species still surviving in africa. Homo naledi and our other african rivals Are overwhelmed. And it's time for our mental advantage to go global. An extreme ice age causes sea levels To drop nearly 250 feet. Sections of the red sea narrow to just a few miles wide. It's a new route out of africa That some of our ancestors now use To spread across the world. The decline and disappearance Of all remaining rival homo species Can be traced to this great migration. And our rivals are not the only casualties. We now begin to have an impact on the planet Unlike any other animal before or since. The latest ice age approaches its peak. Over the last 30,000 years, Our ancestors have spread across the globe. But their path to the americas was hindered. Deep oceans proved a formidable obstruction, But now this barrier disappears. Expanding ice caps cause sea levels To dip to record lows. In 2014, a satellite survey between siberia and alaska Measures the shallow contours of the seabed. Here is conclusive proof that 25,000 years ago, A 600-mile land corridor opens up. Across it, animals and humans start to migrate. But evidence from this late migration tells a bigger story... That humans have by now amassed The power to unbalance an entire ecosystem. In michigan, a team of paleontologists investigates The remains of an ice age lake. Team leader dr. Dan fisher unearths incredible evidence Of the deadly impact of this human migration. What's that? There's something there. Okay, this shape right here Is the central column-like section of a vertebra, The part that supports weight. Oh! There's another one below this. These are the remains of an icon of the ice age... The woolly mammoth. Humans living here at this time Would absolutely have encountered them On a more or less daily basis. Before humans arrived, Mammoths and other large animals roamed throughout the americas. But they had never faced a predator this cunning. Fisher's evidence shows Just how sophisticated these hunters were. I think this comes from the base of the skull That was cleaved off. This would suggest, not in a single piece, Maybe in multiple pieces, We have this very targeted damage on the skull. They broke in just where it was necessary To most easily remove the entire brain. The early humans aren't just eating The nutritious brain. They know how to prepare and preserve it. The fact that it's found in the pond Is consistent with the notion That they store brains in skulls in lakes for a month or two To sort of season them And, and get them sort of to just the right consistency, But then they'll eat them directly. Mammoths once dominated this landscape. But fossil evidence shows that by 10,000 years ago, Their numbers are in steep decline. And the clues point to one culprit. You might think that a small human population Would never make a dent in the populations like this, But these are slow-reproducing animals. When they suffer losses to hunting year after year, It has the potential to have a serious impact On the population as a whole. The evidence strongly supports human activity As the principal cause of the mammoths' extinction. The end of the mammoths is proof That as early as 10,000 years ago, Our adaptive brain gives us enormous influence Over our environment. But globally, our scattered populations Still total fewer than five million. In this ice age world, our numbers are limited By the scarcity of the wild resources we depend on. But the planet itself will soon create opportunity For a new way of life. Humans will harness the power of cultivation, Transforming not just our population, But our societies, even the whole ecosystem. Our planet today is lit up by civilization. But 10,000 years ago, Not a single town or city exists. All humans are nomads. They live in small groups of hunter-gatherers, Always on the move, Hunting wild animals and foraging wild plants. This lifestyle has changed little for over 100,000 years. But just 5,000 years later, grand structures appear Alongside teeming cities, Hallmarks of civilization. It's a dramatic turning point. And a set of top secret photographs May just have revealed where it all began. In the 1960s, at the height of the cold war, America launches a spy satellite program... Corona. For decades, the 800,000 satellite photographs Of the corona program remain top secret, But in 1995, an archaeologist from the smithsonian institution Persuades the government to declassify the images. This treasure trove of data May just have identified the world's first city. Anthropologist dr. Jesse casana has spent years Studying corona spy photographs of the middle east. The images are invaluable Because 50 years ago when the photos were taken, The countryside was far less industrialized. Ancient details remain visible, if you know what to look for. We were able to document Something like 10,000 previously unknown archaeological sites That, through the history of 150 years Of archaeologists working in the middle east, No one had ever documented. In 2007, The spy images herald a breakthrough, Revealing details that are causing experts To reclassify one settlement as the world's first city. 4,000 years older than the pyramids of egypt, It's called tell brak. It looks like a gigantic hill today, And surrounding the big hill is a fan of other settlement That encompasses a very large area. It's the remains of an ancient city That was probably first founded more than 6,000 years ago, And that makes it perhaps the oldest city in the world. Settlements like tell brak only start to appear After a dramatic event transforms the environment. It's the end of the last ice age. Earth's climate radically shifts. The planet is at its warmest point in 100,000 years. Where tell brak lies is an area of the middle east Known as the fertile crescent. It's now that it becomes fertile. Rainfall and temperatures increase, Leading to a great expansion of grassland. Climate change is about to fuel a food revolution. For millennia, humans foraged wild grass seeds, But now abundant wheat and barley Prove easy to grow and to control. Some people begin to settle, To nurture and protect their crops. They gradually give up the hunter-gatherer lifestyle To become farmers. From this point forward, Human reliance on cultivated plants and domesticated animals Will begin to change the landscape. With agriculture, people began to have an impact, Taking a few plants, then breeding them, Growing them, and rejecting all of the other plants around them, Simplifying those ecosystems. Tell brak is special because the earliest evidence Of this shift to agriculture Is visible in the corona images... The world's first roads. What we can see Are these, these dark linear features That extend out from the site like the spokes on a wheel. They're really long. They extend four or five kilometers, and what they are Are the remains of probably the earliest known roadways In the world. What we are able to reconstruct Is that, in the immediate hinterland surrounding the city, There would have been extensive fields Of intensively cultivated wheat and barley. The sheep and goat that lived with the people Here in tell brak, They would need to pass by those fields, And they didn't want to trample the wheat, So they would be kind of constrained, And so that's how we get these roadways forming. They served as passage For large herds of sheep and goat and other animals To come in and out of the city. The settled populations expand, Overwhelming the remaining hunter-gatherers, Transforming the landscape With fields, villages, towns, And eventually cities. As these cities become the hubs of great civilizations, This is the moment humanity becomes visible from space. Over the next few thousand years, Agricultural revolutions occur across the globe. Each civilization is built Around locally cultivated plants. In china and southeast asia, rice and millet. In the americas, corn or potatoes. And wherever agriculture takes hold, There is a population explosion. By the first century a.D., The world population is over 170 million. By 1500, it's 500 million. The footprint of expanding human populations Spreads over the entire surface of the earth. But now, as long as we rely solely On plants and animals for energy, Our growth is constrained. Further progress is unlikely If not for a hidden source of power lying under our feet. Above our heads today, Scores of satellites orbit the earth. Their mission... treasure seeking. Using an array of sensors, they probe the planet's surface, Seeking an energy bonanza Buried hundreds of millions of years ago. Over the earth's 4.5-billion-year history, It has experienced many violent transformations. But through them all, The sun has shone, bathing the surface with light, A source of incredible energy. When life takes off in earnest, It does so because it has perfected photosynthesis... Using light energy to trap carbon from the air In leaves, stems, and trunks. For over 100 million years, immense forests swamp the globe, And the seas fill with life. As plants and animals die, their remains become fossilized. They lock up the solar energy that created them In coal, oil, and gas, Which millions of years later Will utterly transform human societies. Since the start of civilization, To keep the fires burning, Populations rely on wood for fuel. And by around 300 years ago, Populated areas like europe and china Burn up most of their forests. If they use up all their wood, Their civilizations may soon collapse. But in the 18th century, Humans tap the true potential of fossil fuels... Developing machines to harness This buried source of rich energy. Over just a few hundred years, They fuel humanity's great leap forward... The industrial revolution. We're tapping into this fossilized source of carbon That's been deposited over hundreds of millions of years, And we're then burning that energy up, And that's really an energy revolution that's so recent That I, I think sometimes We don't realize how important it is. Access to fossilized energy Puts human civilization into overdrive. The energy revolution lets all of us Consume a huge amount of power. The amount of energy that each one of us use in our daily lives Is equivalent to having, You know, more than 100 people working for you full-time. Gasoline-fueled vehicles link cities. Coal- and oil-powered ships link continents. Technological innovation allows instant communication Across the planet. Civilization is now truly global. But this energy revolution Also unleashes humanity's potential For incredible destructive power. The explosion of the first atomic bomb Marks a turning point for humankind. Over the following decades, More than 2,000 atomic warheads are tested. They generate an unprecedented release of radioactive dust That spreads across the globe. If you were a geologist ten million years from now, Some of it would still be visible In the sediments deposited in the mid-20th century. This is the moment Geologists consider the official start of the age of humans, The point when a species of ape achieved the power To determine the destiny of all life on earth. So far, the fear of mutual destruction Has kept us from nuclear holocaust. But in the age of humans, There are other ways we can threaten our own survival. It took humanity 300,000 years To reach a population of one billion. But in just two centuries, Our fossil-fueled civilization has rocketed to seven billion. We are now spread, in increasing density, Over the entire habitable surface of the globe. During my life span, The population of the planet has more than doubled. The impact of that, of course, Is that people need food, land, iphones, Cars, buses, cities. So as humans grow, they're appropriating the natural world At a staggering rate. It's estimated that to feed everyone, Farmers will need to produce As much food in the next 40 years As they have in the previous 8,000. But as we turn most of the globe to agriculture, We are destroying animal diversity. Today, livestock farming Covers a quarter of all available land. In just 50 years, wild mammal numbers Have dropped by almost 60 percent. One of the things we've been seeing is over time Is that there are less animals than there used to be. There are less fish than there used to be. There's less wild land than there used to be. Extinction rates are 1,000 times higher Than ever measured before. How long are we going to continue To decrease the habitat for other species? Because if it continues, I think there's not much doubt That we will end up in a mass extinction. We may not notice The extinction of most wild animals, But our addiction to fossilized energy Is becoming impossible to ignore. Burning fossil fuels pumps huge quantities Of ancient carbon into the atmosphere... Far too much for today's plants, soils, or oceans To reabsorb. We're using the fossil fuel reservoir A million times faster than it was generated, And there are climatic and ecosystem consequences to that That are going to be present for thousands of years to come. Measurements from space probes Confirm that our atmosphere is altering at an alarming rate. We've increased the amount of carbon dioxide By more than 40 percent. We've more than doubled the amount of methane, Another trace gas in the atmosphere. Each one of those things is changing the climate, Is changing the weather. Earth's history tells us Rapid change in climate can be disastrous. We have past examples Where the amount of co2 has gone up And the earth's climate has warmed, So it's a fact. 56 million years ago, The climate warmed nearly 14 degrees fahrenheit Over a few thousand years. Fossils show that to survive the conditions, Most species of mammal shrank in size by over a third. But under our watch, The climate is changing at a much faster pace. In the last two centuries, Ocean acidity increased by 25 percent. In the last 100 years, sea levels rose 8 inches, And in just 50 years, Nearly half of our arctic ice has disappeared. We are creating a new planetary environment. We're pushing a system In a direction that it's never been before. Just in the space of 150 years, We have become a geological force To, to match almost anything that you see In, in a billion years of earth history. We face a calamity of our own making, But our species came this far Through brain power and the tools we created, So can our tools come to our rescue? The problems caused by humanity's great expansion Have been brewing for centuries. But scientists believe It's the actions of this current generation That will decide the future of the planet. Humans are a turning point In the history of life on earth. We've become a global phenomenon And responsible for the intensity Of what is going on to our planet, To the ecosystems on which Not only other organisms, but human life depends. This is, in many ways, Our own survival challenge for the future. And now we have technology to help us, Satellites to monitor our planet and help find solutions. Our orbiting probes have already helped avert a global disaster. In the 1980s, above antarctica, Nasa satellites provide crucial confirmation Of a gaping hole in the ozone layer. This thin layer of gas high in the atmosphere Is a vital protective shield against the harshest solar rays. We tan, we enjoy being in the sun, But if we were in the sun without an ozone layer, We would burn almost instantly, And it would be very, very difficult for life to exist. The culprit is a side-product Of globalized industry, Ozone-destroying man-made gases Used in aerosols and refrigeration. Spurred by the satellite evidence, Politicians around the world unite in action. No one can opt out. The chemicals are banned. Decades later, Ozone levels are on the road to recovery. We avoided the cliff. Nobody predicted this. What would have happened? It would have reconfigured life on earth. Space technology helped prevent disaster. Given the chance, The atmosphere has the power to heal itself. Other satellite studies show that some animal species Also appear to show resilience in the age of humans. In downtown chicago, Dr. Stan gehrt uses gps technology To study a population of coyotes. It's extremely difficult for us To even pick up their signals on the ground, But the satellites can pick them up. Radio-collaring over 400 coyotes, Gehrt documents how this species is thriving in the human world. One of the most amazing things is just how many coyotes Can live in a major metropolitan area And live so close to people. We estimate that there's 3,000 to 4,000 coyotes here. We have coyotes that are literally Within just a few yards from people on a regular basis With people not knowing that they're there. They survive by adapting To the urban environment. Coyotes have to learn traffic patterns. They have to learn how to cross roads And avoid getting hit by cars, And that is the biggest risk to their life down here, And yet they're able to do that. The patterns that we're seeing in chicago With coyotes moving into the city Is being seen in virtually every single metropolitan area Across north america. If we can make space for nature, It can survive alongside us. Satellites can also provide A path to preserving animal diversity. Radio-tagging technology Allows the mapping of wildlife migration routes Thousands of miles long, Maps we can use to create protected corridors To save species from human interference. It's just one example Of how space data helps protect our planet. Truly we live in a remarkable time, When we as humans have technology, We have the ability to plan ahead, We know our geologic past. We can put all that together And actually conceive of a desirable future And build a global plan to get to that future. That's the challenge for humanity in the 21st century. From our perspective, Our human story is epic in scope. Our civilization is measured in thousands of years... Our species in hundreds of thousands. But the earth measures time In millions and billions of years. Our planet has lived only half of its life span. For the last 4.5 billion years, It has experienced monumental change. Species that dominate then disappear, Giving rise to new life. Humanity's entire existence is a brief moment of brilliance On this immense timeline. And the stable environment we have relied on Will not last. Over earth's next few billion years, More ice ages, epic volcanic eruptions, Meteor impacts, and extinctions Will be inevitable. But the planet's history Tells us some forms of life will survive. Where we fit into this future is up to us.
