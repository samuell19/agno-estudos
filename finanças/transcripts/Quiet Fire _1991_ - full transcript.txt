[chime] [footsteps splashing on street] [suspenseful music] [intense music] Ah. [intense music] [gunfire and intense music] [tires squealing] [intense music] [fire blazing] Hello there. How are you? Oh, hi there. How are you? It's so nice to see you again. Nice to see you. It's this way, isn't it? Thank you. [birds chirping] My men were being shot down one after another. I set a booby trap with my last bullet. My shot was a direct hit as the bullets ripped through my body. My entire squadron lying about me dead and dying. But I had annihilated the enemy. And I vowed then and there to never let another American boy be put in the same no-win situation I was. Next time, I said to myself, when we play, and play we will, we play to win. With your support, both moral and financial, Senator J. William Whelan will make you proud, once again, to be an American. God bless you. Excuse me. [funky music] Great speech, J.W. You killed'em, you just killed'em. Yeah, terrific. Well, another day, another $100,000 dollars. Cut the bullshit Frank. Our problem, is it solved? Um-- Well? Well, our contract is engaged in a high speed pursuit through downtown LA and-- well, the target apparently eluded them. And they were incinerated when their vehicles crashed and burned. All of'em? You could fuck up a wet dream, Frank. Yes, sir. The clock is ticking. Time is running out. The election is on Tuesday. Walt spills his guts, he can not only screw up my Senate bid, but he could send me to jail. And I'd happily take you down with me, capisce? Yes, sir. Now take care of him, now. Got it? Got it. [birds chirping] [ominous music] [upbeat music] Hey baby. Listen, what do you say after your workout, the two of us, we'll go back to my place. I'll pour you a little carrot juice. I'll even give you some of my fresh homemade dessert. Me. Aaron, fuck off. Come on baby. I catch you checking me out all the time. [music and weights clanking] You're such an asshole. Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, I'm not going to take no for an answer. Two suspensions aren't enough for you Aaron? Beat it. Go do your work out. Get out. Beat it. Thanks Jesse. VOICE ON INTERCOM: Jesse Palmer to the front desk. Jesse Palmer to the front desk, please. Walt. [music playing] I don't believe it. What's happening, Jess? It's been a long time. Longer than that, man. How you been doing? I've been getting by. Damn. Do you got a minute? Well, sure ah-- come on step into with office. Come on. Damn Walt it must be at these five years. What's the matter, you don't like my face or something? Hey man I'm into the shit knee deep. Besides, I never did care much for that ugly mug of yours. Oh, you could use a face lift yourself. You still got that long list of lovelies or are you sealed down and settled up? Yeah, you know me. I'm still living large off that fat of the land. Same old Walt. Yeah, same old me. Aho. Oh, man. I feel like hammered dog shit. You don't look so hurt either. You're kidding right? Got to replace those electrolytes, buddy, right? What you been up to? I'm in the auto body repair business, Jess, and the wholesale distribution game. Been doing pretty good. Yeah, I seem to remember you having some troubles, a whole lot of trouble. They never could prove I busted into that jewelry store, Jess. Besides that was then and-- and this is now. Right buddy? So ah-- you got a chop shop? The best in LA. It's a real sweet gig when it's working. I got some other shit too. But ah-- I'm not sure you want to know about it. You don't have to explain to me, man. You're doing OK for yourself. I make a living. So, what can I do for you buddy? You OK, bro? [intense music] Oh, Jesus Christ. What the-- what the hell happened Walt? I had nowhere else to go, Jess. It's all right. Just take it easy, man. Just-- just take it easy. You're next. What are you talking about man? What do you mean? It's on-- on the disk, computer disk. Come on, man, talk--talk to me,man. Talk to me. Store. Broads. Store. [suspenseful music] RUSSO: Now wait a minute. I want to get this thing straight. You're in the gym, minding your own business. That's right. When all of a sudden this buddy from yesterday just happened to drop in for a visit. - Just to say hello. - That's right. Bullshit. Oh, and by the way, did I mention I've been shot to death? Look, I know it sounds kind of weird but -- Come on, Jesse, give us a break, would ya? Who do you think we are, a couple of fucking idiots. I'm just telling you what I know. Sounds like bullshit to me. You're going to take the heat for your dead buddy. Now wa--wait a minute. Look at the wrap sheet on this guy. You name it. He's done it. Robbery, burglary, criminal possession of stolen property. Forgery, B&E. Assault, carrying a concealed weapon, grand theft auto. That's a-- Man, I'm outta here, man. Bullshit. Get up. Talk to me. Wait, wai- what--what do you guys want me to say? That I killed him? Yes, make our lives just a little easier, would you? And what's my mama supposed to do? Why would I want to kill Walt? - Maybe he ripped you off. He ripped off everybody else-- - He didn't rip me off. He just got himself killed. And he just came to see you before he died? And he did say anything about anything? No he didn't. Don't I don't know what's up. Maybe he's telling the truth. What do you think Overstreet? I think we gotta let him go. I say we book the sonofabitch. On what charge? Concealed weapon. That weapon belonged to Walt. You guys know that. Tell that to somebody who gives a shit. Just tell us what you know. All right, yeah. He did say one thing. What's that? He said I'm next. Your next? What the fuck does that mean? I-- I don't know. Does that mean you're going to get shot next? I-- I just don't know. Get the fuck outta here. I'm going to need some protection. What? Get the fuck out of my station before I change my mind. Get outta here. Jesus. Let's get a beer. Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, yeah, OK, yeah, that's for me. Do it. Yabba dabba do, baby. Agh. Go on, give it to me. I want it. Oo, that looks so-- So ah dude was a friend of yours, huh? Yeah, saved my ass in Nam more than once. I was there about two months. Laying sound asleep in my bunk and then all of a sudden all hell breaks loose. Well. BARTENDER: Another? Yeah. I wake up fast, right? There's Chuck. BARTENDER: Chuck? Yeah, Victor Charlie, VC. This little guy in the black pajamas, right, with a shiv that you could carve a Thanksgiving turkey with. Yeah. , Anyway, he comes up next to my bunk, right? He's next to my bunk, man, he's coming up to me. Walt, shit-- I'll tell you man, the dude, man, he never slept. Walt took him down. Killed him? With his own blade. But anyway, I'm there right, shaking like like a fucking leaf, right? Now Walt, he's cool, right? And I'm looking at this guy, I'm looking at this guy like I know him. Now, that's crazy, like-- like-- like I'm going to know some fucking VC, right? BARTENDER: So did you? Walt, he turns to me. He says, that's our barber, man. Barber? Yeah, in Saigon. We all went to this one barber. He was also a pimp. He had a righteous stable too, right? I got my hair cut from him about three days earlier. I mean, this guy man, he had a straight razor at my throat I don't know how many times. And the fucking guy was V C. So Walt saved your life. RADIO NEWS PERSON: Today in the news, the President announces a trade embargo. Congress tries and fails to pass the budget for the third straight day. And finally senatorial candidate, J. William Whelan gets ready to wind up his senatorial campaign by calling his opponent a wimp and pledging to build up the military so he can play to win any future overseas conflicts. [click] [keys clattering on table] Bills. [INTENSE MUSIC AND FIGHTING SHOUTS] Who are you guys? [INTENSE MUSIC AND FIGHTING SHOUTS] [footsteps] [gunfire] [suspenseful music] [club music] A guy with a blue sweatshirt, dome through here? Get the fuck off of me, man. Deke, get outta here. [music playing] [thump] Listen, um, how would you like to come with me to New York on a business trip? Three days, three nights, nothing but the expensive best. I'll sleep on it and let you know. Would you like for me to tuck you in? Todd, I have to be up at 6:00. Oh, um, I hope you enjoyed the concert. Yeah, it was great. I really love Spike Jones Jr. Thanks. I thought you would. You're welcome. Ah, I really had a great time. Oh come on. Can I just come in for a second? Ah, no Todd, I have to-- Look, look, look, I won't stay too long. Just let me come in for one second. - Todd, no. - Just one second. - No, wait, Todd. - Please one second. - No. - What the hell's going on here? Who the hell are-- I'm her husband. Who the hell are you, bud? - Husband? - Ah, what are you doing here? What are you doing with my wife? You didn't tell me you were married. Married ah-- Just time to get on your way, huh, buddy, huh? Yeah, yeah. - Tod, no wait-- come-- - OK man. Come-- Hey. Why'd you treat my friend like that? - You ought to thank me. - Thank you? That guy was an asshole. For your information, that guy was an investment banker. See, what'd I tell you? It's over Jesse. It's been over for six months. And I'd like it to stay that way. I know that. Then what the hell do you call this? Jana, I'm in trouble. Look, whatever trouble you're in, I can't help you. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Now you can just fly right outta here the same way you blew in. Just shut up. Shut up listen. Shut up. What is it? I need a place to stay. Now, I can't explain it now. But at least for tonight, I need to stay here. Look, I'm not getting good vibes from this. You rush in here like I don't know what and expect me to believe what you're telling me, which is nothing, Jesse. It doesn't make sense. Look, they had my place covered, all right? There was two men inside and outside waiting to get me. And I just took off. I got nowhere else to go. Look, I'm not crazy about you being here. In fact, I should throw your butt out right now. But there's one thing I know about you Jesse. You're not a liar. You want to sleep on the couch tonight, be my guest. Thanks. One night. And then you're outta here. I don't want you scaring off any more investment bankers, understood? You'll get no trouble from me. I'm going to bed. The guy was an asshole. Is it really that bad? Hm. I thought you were asleep. I was. Want to talk about it? Did I ever tell you about my friend Walt? We were pals back in Vietnam. You were in Vietnam? We were there towards the end when things were bad, real bad. I mean, most of the grunts, they wouldn't even go out. I mean, hell, why chance getting killed when you know the war was going to be over in a few weeks. But us? Whew, we were different. It didn't matter to us. We were what you call the elite forces. Elite forces? You weren't like the Green Beret's? Yeah, only a little more covert. That's the word that they used in Washington. You know, we did all the off-the-book counter-surveillance operations, you know, counter-surveillance, sabotage, you know, all the dirty work. Like what? Let's just say I've seen enough death to last me three lifetimes. And I never wanted to see it again. But Vietnam was like 20 years ago. You're home now. You're safe. They got Walt. They? Who's they? Who knows. Why would anyone want to kill you, Jesse? What happens now? I don't know. I don't know. I don't understand why anyone would want to kill you. You never had any enemies. You know before Walt dies he was-- he was trying to tell me something. What was it? I'm not sure. Hey, look, ah-- you can't be having a modeling career with heavy baggage under your eyes. Don't you think you should get some sleep? Yeah, OK. But you too. I will. The guy was definitely an asshole. Good night. [music playing] Because I want to get the kind that has the CD they pull out. Oh, I do too. But see if I do that, will it run in my car. May I help you? Mm. VOICE ON TV: Some people think that you might be laying it on a bit thick. Hey. Look. I don't want the fact that I actually fought in the Vietnam War, unlike my opponent, that I led 71 combat missions over Vietnam, unlike my opponent, or that I was wounded in battle and left for dead, again, unlike my opponent to influence you this coming Tuesday in any way. No, you should vote for me because of your kids. Because only I can provide them with a country that stands tall in a fallen world, a country that can't be pushed around by greed and avarice and cowardice and dishonor. That's why you should vote for me, J. William Whelan for United States Senate. It's only America's future at stake. So what do you think? About what? Senator Whelan silly. Oh, I think he's cute. Yassmin Taylor, you don't vote for a candidate because he's cute. Well, I do, girlfriend. No wonder this country is in such bad shape. Well, are you gonna vote for him? Mm-hm. And why? I don't know, he has something, a real-- A real cute smile. Integrity. And great hair. Oh, you're a lost cause. Oh, you gonna tell me about your date with Todd McMasters or what? It was all right. But he tried to feel me up. God, it figures. He's such a dildo, God. Oh, and did he promise you a trip to New York with all the expensive best? How'd you know? Because he tried that same old line on April, Michelle, and yours truly, thank you very much. Hey, we ought to go and check in at the agency before it closes. Oh, yeah, you know, the John Paul's Swim Wear Show. It should be fun. Biggest show of the year. Oh, and just think, all those rich, eligible guys that are going to be there. Ow. Oh, come on, silly. [funky music] Coming in. Watch the gate. Hey dude. Yo. Pull the gate. [intense music] Thanks. Gentlemen, have a seat. You do good work. Right at this moment, you and your partner are the only ones on this payroll doing good work. One of the great things about being a cop, you got a badge, you got the power. Yeah, it's so easy to fuck with people. - People like my opponent? - Oh yeah. You can dig dirt up on'em, shut down their headquarters, even cancel the security for their appearances. The one I like the best is when the riot breaks out at his last rally. Six point swing in the polls. Which means I'm now leading by 12 points, which is why there's 10 grand bonus in that envelope. I take care of my people. Your generosity exceeds yourself, Senator. Oh, yeah. And that's just the beginning. Once the Senator, Mr. Whelan, assumes the senatorial post-- And we become heads of security. Then we're all looking at some real money. Seven figures? Maybe eight. Anything on the front burner? Oh, yeah. [door opening] Open it. Let me present the Viper. The latest is on the shoulder mount, heat seeking surface, surface missile. See that car? [explosion] [intense music] It can destroy a tank at 1,000 yards. Africa, Middle East, South America, we could sell a million of those units next year provided I win the Senate seat and all the connections that go with it. So what do you want from us? A man named Jesse Palmer. Now that Walt's been terminated, he's the only loose cannon. How's that? Jesse Palmer was Walt's pal in Nam. I was their commanding officer. Jesse is an expert in counterinsurgency, not to be taken lightly. What Walt knows, there's every reason that Jesse now knows the same thing. What makes you think that Jesse knows for sure? He's got to know. Why else would he have gone to see him before he died? Well, I wish you would have told us that sooner. For Christ's sakes, we had the sonofabitch in custody. So I've been told. I understand you got some local talent on the case. I do. But I've been greatly disappointed. It's really quite simple. We find Jesse. We kill him. We all get rich or we don't. He squeals, we all go to jail. Capisce? [traffic noises and music] Ah, Kim? Kim Martina? Listen, pig. I'm clean. How come you guys are always hassling me? Look, you want to check it out? See? Clean OK? Clean OK? I'm not a cop. Well, you're not a customer. What do you want? I met you through Walt. Walt? Walt? Walt. Do you know where he is? Because if I ever see him again, I'm gonna kill him. He sold me a 635 CSI Beamer. What he didn't tell me was he put a '78 Buick engine in it. It blew up. It blew up in my face. I could have died. He's dead. Bummer. That's a bummer. Look, whoever um-- whoever did Walt is trying to do me to. Trying real hard. What'd you say your name was? Ah, Jesse, Jesse Palmer. Walt, he was a friend of mine. Why-- why are people trying to kill you? That's what I need to find out. Walt was always into some weird trip or another, you know, even in Nam. You name it, Walt had a piece of it. Whores, black market, freaky drugs. He told me once that he wired the officers offices after dark and then shook'em down for ah blackmail. I really liked him. Can you ah-- can you tell me anything? Not really. I mean, if you want to know what actually killed Walt, I don't know. A 1,000 things could have killed Walt, you know? He didn't have many friends. Well, whatever it was it-- it must be something we both had in common. So you figure it out. Um, do you-- do you know where his chop shop is? Nope. Did um-- did Walt have a piece of this? Oh, hell no. It's a cool place. Thanks. Just trying to keep the dream alive and pay the rent. Yeah, well ah-- anyway, thanks. Truly. You be cool, Jess. [music playing] [traffic noises] [suspenseful music] - Mr. Palmer? - What? Mr. Palmer, you've had several phone calls today, including two from that policeman, Detective Russo. Later, later. [beeping of intercom] HEATHER (ON INTERCOM): Mr. Palmer, there are two gentlemen here to see you. Do-- do they have appointments? No they don't. They say they want to sign up for a personalized exercise program. Heather, what's wrong with your voice? Ah, laryngitis I suppose. They say you came highly recommended. And apparently they're on a very tight schedule, Mr. Palmer. Mr. Palmer? Mr. Palmer. Mr. Palmer? [intense music] [tires squealing] [intense music] [phone rings] Fairway Station. JESSE PALMER: Hey, look, ah-- listen um-- I need to talk to somebody. There's a couple of guys that are trying to kill me. Can you state the reason for your call, sir? I just told you, there's a couple of guys that are trying to kill me. POLICE WOMAN (ON PHONE): Are you damaged in any way? No. But I--I need to talk to somebody, anybody. Is anybody you'd care to speak to specifically? JESSE PALMER: What are you stupid or something? I just said there's a couple of guys trying to kill me. I'll have to put you on hold a moment please. JESSE PALMER: No, don't put me on hold. Wait a minute. Sir? Look, ah-- there's a Detective Russo there. Let me talk to him, please. What was that name again? Detective Russo? JESSE PALMER (ON PHONE): Jesse Palmer. Who? JESSE PALMER (ON PHONE): Jesse Palmer. Oh, Jesse Palmer. Look, I've been trying to get in touch with you. JESSE PALMER (ON PHONE): Oh, hey, listen man, look I'm in deep shit. Man, I need your help. RUSSO: No problem. Just relax. Now tell me everything. I'm been stalked by a couple of men that are trying to kill me. Any idea who they are? JESSE PALMER (ON PHONE): I don't know. Every time I look up I'm dodging bullets. I need your protection, man. What are you going to do about it? Listen, is there some place we can meet, you know, someplace we can go talk? JESSE PALMER (ON PHONE): I-- I can't go home. I don't know. I-- I don't know. Are you sure? I don't know dammit. I don't know. OK, calm down now, Jesse. Relax. Take your time and think. I got a place, yeah. Shoot. Ah, she lives-- I have a girlfriend. She looks out in Westwood, ah 3712 Galia, apartment two, yeah, that-- that's it. Perfect. Now, we'll meet you at her house. Uh-huh. Now, we may have a line on these guys. Yeah? OK. You go there and sit tight. And we'll be there by 8 o'clock sharp. - Right. - You got it? Yeah, OK. Thanks. Good boy. We got him. [traffic noises] Shit, I don't know. What do you think? I like this one the best. It looks ah-- se-- senatorial. Yeah? Very much so. [phone rings] Yeah? OVERSTREET (ON PHONE): Hey, I got an address for ya. You found him? OVERSTREET (ON PHONE): Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, 427 Galia Avenue, Westwood, apartment two. Got it. Got a lead on Jesse. Great, that's great. I'm going to try again. Only this time I want you to go along to make sure they get the job done. Ah, um, I-- I'm-- I'm a political consultant, not an assassin. What's the difference? YASSMIN: Oh, God. Look at this guy. No way. Oh, look at this guy's doo. That's my favorite. That curl is centuries years old. [door bell rings] Come on now. Who is it? [tv voices] Jesus Christ Jesse. What the hell is this? Scare the shit out of Jana week? You must be the famous Jesse Palmer, mm. What the hell are you doing back here? He has broad shoulders, mm. Returning your car keys. Well, give'em to me and get out. Sh. Don't tell me to sh. Is this a lover's quarrel? This is my house. And I can yell as loud as I want to. Well, kids, listen, I think it's time for me to run. Listen, it's been really fun. And it's been real. But I gotta run. And Jesse it was a major pleasure to meet you. Mm. Now, you two make such a cute couple. I envy you so. Bye. [tv voices] Who's that? JANA: It's my best friend. And what is it to you? Having a nice day? Yeah. More trouble? Lots. What happened? It's real bad out there. They try to kill you again? Too close for comfort. I don't know if I can handle this, Jesse. Why are they trying to kill you? I don't know. You're not holding out on me, are you? What are you talking about? Because you always used to do that. What? You, Jesse Palmer, Mr. Strong silent type. I didn't know you were in Vietnam until last night. Yeah, well, you know things-- Yeah, well, I thought I loved you once. But I didn't even know you were. [tv voices] Look, I want to help you Jesse. But you have to let me in. [tv voices] OK. TV ANNOUNCER: And on the political front, prospective candidate Whelan and his pretty wife Barbara attended their award-winning garden. The US senatorial candidate hopeful-- I know that guy. TV ANNOUNCER: Flowers in-- JESSE PALMER: He was my CO in Nam. Really? TV ANNOUNCER: He says that's what he proposes to do as a job-- - What an asshole. TV ANNOUNCER: If elected. - Turn that thing off. Oh, well, just because you don't like-- Sh. TV ANNOUNCER: Hand built. It took an estimated 3 and 1/2 years to complete, but it is-- What is it? I hope it's the cops. I told'em to meet me here. [shotgun blast] [screaming] [shotgun blasts] [gunfire] Agh. [gunfire] [screaming] [intense music] You all right? You're OK. You're OK. Look at me. Look-- look at me. Look at me. You're OK, all right? You're OK. Right? All right? Right now, we're going to get out of here. All right? J. WILLIAM WHELAN: Good. Yeah, good. That's going to work just fine. OK. J. WILLIAM WHELAN: Now, freeze it here. And we'll put a voiceover and some music. Yeah, that'll be nice. [knocking] What? It's me, Frank, Mr. Whelan. Come in. Steve, would you mind? - No problem. Well? We didn't do so good. Jesse, Jesse. The man's got nine lives, I swear. Flew over 50 sabotage missions in Nam. And he's still walking around. All right, now it's time to do things right. I'm going to stop fucking around. [traffic noises] [tv voices] [coughing] Excuse me. I'd like to get a room. [tv voices] Yeah? We need a-- we need a room for the night. You freaking? To sleep? How much for a room? MOTEL CLERK: $20. JESSE PALMER: 20?

[tv voices] $20 in advance. Sign it. [tv voices] [baby crying] [tv voices] Check out time is 12:00 noon. Don't be late. [tv voices] [baby crying] And what you looking at Ms. Girlfriend? Giving me the evil eye. You're lucky I don't climb across this counter and set fire to your natural ass. You just think you hot shit. Well, you ain't shit to me, old skinny mini, giraffe neck, ashy leg, Bart Simpson looking onion head. [yelling] [music playing] Nice, real nice. And one bed, how convenient. I'll sleep in the chair. You better believe you will. At least we'll be safe here. JANA: You hope. Shit, I could have gone to New York with Todd this weekend. He's a loser. And you're not? I'm still alive, aren't I? JANA: I don't like this. I don't like this at all. Earth to Jessie, do you read me? Jesse David Palmer. - Clyde. JESSE PALMER: Excuse me? Walt, he had an older brother named Clyde. Now maybe he knows something. Imagine somebody who knows something. Hey look, it's not-- I didn't ask for this. And neither did I. I know you didn't. If you want to leave, I'll understand. [music playing] Jesse? Yeah, baby? Why does it always have to be you? You're just lucky, I guess. You still want me to sleep in the chair? Absolutely. Tough shit. [music playing] [funky music] [door buzzer rings] [funky music] CLYDE: Jesse. Come on in, man. I hope I'm not disturbing you. No bother at all. Can I get you anything, some ah-- some soda, beer, some sparkling fruit water. No thanks. Yeah, you sure now? M--m-- make yourself at home, man. I've been trying to finish a painting for a client. But my head just isn't into it today. God, I haven't seen you in-- how long has it been? About 10 years. Sorry about your brother. Yeah, me too. Good old Walt. What'd you want to ask me? You sounded kind of mysterious on the phone. I was lucky you were still listed. You know anybody would want to kill Walt? Walt was in some pretty shady doings. And his temper, well, you knew him. So he had a lot of enemies. Yeah, I'd say so. Any one in particular? Not that he told me about. I hadn't seen him that much lately. Was he into anything new recently, ah-- moving in on anyone's action? M-- m-- maybe. We talked on the phone a couple of weeks ago. He said he was going to make a big score. But he didn't give me any details. And I didn't ask. Hey, I appreciate your concern, Jesse. But I'm sure the cops can handle it. I wouldn't be too sure. What do you mean? Just before your brother died, he said he put something down on computer disk. Now what, I don't know. But whatever it is, it must be dynamite. Now do you know what or where that could be? Jeez, no, I went through all this stuff, what was left of it. The cops tossed his place pretty good. You know where his chop shop is? Yeah, 24th and Beaudry. You tell the cops? F-- hell no. And believe me, they asked. Good. Man, thanks. Good luck with that. You going to attend the funeral, aren't ya? I don't think I can. I understand. I'll b-- be-- be seeing ya. [funky music] [HORN HONKING AND TRAFFIC NOISES] [eerie music] [glass shattering] [screaming] [intense music] [music with drums playing] [tires squealing] [music with drums playing] [TIRES SQUEALING AND INTENSE MUSIC] You look pretty grim, Jesse. Who died this time? Clyde. My cousin who stutters? And he didn't have 1,000 people who wanted him dead. What the hell's going on? Look, everybody that was cl--close to Walt, they're being killed one by one. You might be next. Me? Come on. Look, if you know anything, you got to let me know now. Jesse, ahem, I don't know anything. And don't you go sending cops around here to protect me, OK? I never learned to trust cops. You know what I mean? Look, if you think of anything, give me a buzz. My number's on the card, all right? Relax man. Just be careful. [intense music] JANA: What'd do you find out? They killed him. I thought I told you keep the curtains closed. Who? Clyde? They tossed him out a window. Jesus Christ, Jesse, what the fuck is going on? We gotta call the police. Maybe they can help us. No. Why the hell not? Because only the police knew I was at your place. And look what happened. Is not your buddy. What? Walter James Tilton, a Vietnam veteran was awarded the Bronze Star. He will buried tomorrow at the Veterans Memorial park. Services will be held at Praise Water Mortuary Home, 11:00 A.M. Bronze star. What? The Bronze Star. Jesse, what is going on? - I gotta go? - Where? To the funeral? I can't let him be buried alone. Jesse, that's crazy. These people, whoever they are, will know that you-- you're going to show. They'll expect you to show They'll know about your stupid code of honor. I gotta do something. Walt wouldn't want you to get blown away at his funeral. Neither would I. [music playing] Closed. closed, man. The lights are out. Can't you see? [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [gunshot] [intense music] Jesse Palmer, please. JESSE PALMER: All right, let's stop. Now, Kim said Walt had a key hidden in the Bronze Star. Now, if I'm not back here in 10 minutes, you get the hell outta here. Jesse-- And don't look back. Oh. [suspenseful music] [eerie music] Go to 24th and Beaudry. What's there? Walt's chop shop. Oh. What makes you think the com-- computer disk would be there? Because he was too smart to stash it at home. Cops already been there anyway. You're doing it again. Doing what? Disappearing on me. I'm sorry. It was just like I'm back in Nam all over again, kill or be killed. A silent enemy at every turn. You don't even know why. [ominous music] You gonna be all right in there? Yeah, look, ah-- just stay put. I'll be right back. [suspenseful music] [crash on barrel] [intense music] This key outta go somewhere. [suspenseful music] Where to? Think. Glove compartment. [intense music] Bingo. How'd it go in there? Ta-da. All right. Ah, shit. Try it again. All right. Come on, baby, give. Jackpot. Oh, wow, this is dynamite. Well, what to do with it. Hey, I know a reporter we can talk to. Yeah, but can we trust him? Sure we can. I've known him for years. He's like an uncle. Wow. This is a hot story. It's a hot story. There's no doubt about it. If it's true. True? Of course it's true. Baby girl, all I've got right now is the word of a petty criminal against that of a United States Congressman and the leading senatorial candidate at that. Since when did the word of a Congressman count for anything, Uncle Mike? You've got a point. Mr. Miller? [knocking] MIKE MILLER: Yes Bridget. I've got those forms that you asked for. Good. BRIDGET: I'm still checking the database and I have the print for you in about five minutes. Very good. Thank you very much. Sure thing. Look, now Walt, he may have not been a model citizen. But he wasn't a liar. So what are you saying, Mike? I need independent verification. It was a behind the lines mission. They choppered us in at about 0500. Now, the target, it was a VC munitions dump. I remember that. And then there was ah-- this bunker in the brush. And then we fanned out. And we started in. And that's when all hell-- it broke loose. There was bombs. There was mortars. The next thing I knew, I woke up in a hospital three months later. So you don't know whether Whelan got on that chopper and left you there to die or not, do you? No, but it all makes sense. The guy was a known opportunist. He was totally into himself. And he wanted that Silver Star and fuck who had to die for him to get it. So you, Whelan, and Walt are the only ones to survive? Yes. What was the name of the team? Quiet Fire. [suspenseful music] [birds chirping] [doorbell rings] [violin music] Thank you, Don. [doorbell rings] Mr. Whelan? Mr. Whelan, I'm sorry I'm late. Heavy traffic. [phone rings] Yes? RUSSO (ON PHONE): Whelan, it's Russo. I see. RUSSO (ON PHONE): I think I got a lead for ya. We've got something of interest. J. WILLIAM WHELAN: Yeah? RUSSO (ON PHONE): I'm the girls apartment. And I think she's in some kind of event. It's John Paul's Spring Swimwear Sensation. I think it's some kind of fashion show. She's got it circled about 20 times. What's the address? RUSSO (ON PHONE): Fashion Center, downtown LA. Very good. Frank, sometimes when you want things done right, you just got to do it yourself. I want to introduce you to Hector and Jax. Oh. How do you do? Hector and Jax are from out of town. Oh? Whereabouts? Doesn't matter. They're professionals, the very best in their field. Wow. So what is it you guys do? Hector and Jax kill people. [intense music] [dishes rattling] I know this is bad timing. But I've got a fashion show to go to. You're not serious? - Yes, I am. - Forget it. Forget it? Forget it. Look, Jesse, I took you in, got my place shot up, missed out on interviews. I'm driving around in a rented vehicle because you destroyed my Mustang. And on top of it, I'm-- I'm living in a hotel that a blind cockroach wouldn't set foot in. It's an important show for my career, Jesse. And I'm not going to miss it. TODD (ON PHONE): OK, all right, good. OK, I've gotta go. [suspenseful music] Spring Swimwear Sensation oughta be a hell of a show. So you're going to wait until after the show to kill him, aren't ya? I don't think so. [suspenseful music] [all talking at once] Ew, look at that. Look. Agh. Agh. It's so gross. What is it? What's wrong? It's the biggest bug I ever saw. Jesus Christ. I though you were stabbed or something. Well, just kill it will you? It's just a bug. [all talking at once] [intense music] Now, aren't you glad we came? [gun shot] [screaming] [intense music and gunfire] Shit. [intense music] [gunfire] [tires squealing] Whew, it's too close for comfort. [ominous music] J. WILLIAM WHELAN: The Middle East brokers are being tough in negotiations. Don't you two ever knock? Well, is his contract canceled? We missed him. J. WILLIAM WHELAN: Not again. Where is he now? We don't know. [music playing] What am I paying you two? We'll get him. $150,000? Do you know what I could buy for $150,000? A prime time spot on the network affiliates. What about Frank? Terminated. Congratulations. And the girl, too. Are you sure? Pretty sure. It's not the girl I'm worried about. [suspenseful music] This Silver Star thing here, means a lot to you, don't it? Key to a dream. So were you ah-- really enjoy injured over there in Nam? Hell, yes. Busted up my leg something terrible. What happened? Got drunk and fell off my golf cart. [phone rings] Yeah? SECURITY GUARD (ON PHONE): There's a prowler on closed circuit, Mr. Whelan. He's here. What? Find him and kill him, right now, right fucking now. [intense music] [engine stopping] Did you hear that? Yeah. Sounds like the AC unit. He's in the boiler room. Shit. Dammit. [intense music] [gunfire and [intense music] Where did he go? I don't know where this thing goes? Come on. Got your back. [intense music] [STEAM HISSING AND WATER DRIPPING] [ominous music] [gun shot] [intense music] Damn, the fucking guy's a ghost. [intense music] [STEAM HISSING AND SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] I got it. Go get that sonofabitch. [intense music] [fight sounds] [intense music] It's you and me mother fucker. Oh. Ah. [intense music and fight sounds] Agh. Agh. [intense music] [gunfire and intense music] Ah. Agh. [intense music and fight sounds] Agh. Bitch. [intense music] [gun shots] [intense music] [gunshot] Sh-- damn. Oo, hm. [intense music and gun shots] Well, Jesse, here we are again. You're good. I always said you were the best grunt I ever commanded. Now, if you'd just died like you were supposed to, I wouldn't have to do this. [clicks from empty gun] It's a Smith & Wesson. And you've had your six. [intense music] [INTENSE MUSIC AND CHOPPER RUNNING] Give me the gun. [INTENSE MUSIC AND CHOPPER RUNNING] [gunshots] [INTENSE MUSIC AND CHOPPER RUNNING] [gunshots] [INTENSE MUSIC AND CHOPPER RUNNING] Shit. [INTENSE MUSIC AND CHOPPER RUNNING] Look's like you've been left again, grunt. [intense music] [explosion] [intense music] [soft music] [sirens and soft music] [music - "quiet fire"] They came and wanted to fight like a bad dream in the night. Losing his mind to fear. Again, they came and thought they had arrived doing to thee on the life. They trained to leave nothing standing. But there's a heat in the heart for the love that we shared. But the song is over. So beware. Ow. Quiet Fire is coming to the surface, baby. Oo. Quiet fire is coming to the surface, baby. If there's a rule and it's been broken, oo, so broken, just beware. Oh. Quiet fire is coming to the surface, baby. Quiet fire is coming to the surface, baby.
