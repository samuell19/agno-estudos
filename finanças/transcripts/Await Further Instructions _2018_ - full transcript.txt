Well... we're here. Can we not do this? I want to meet them. We will spoil everyone's Christmas. Come on! Nick! It's so good to see you. Mum, this Annjaya, Annji. - Annjeera? - Annji. Oh... yes that's lovely. Well, come on in, you must be freezing. We got you this, Mrs. Milgram? Indian sweets. Those are Petha cubes, pumpkin pieces in syrup, Gulab Jamun dumplings, all sorts. Well, that's lovely. Thank you. Thanks. Oh here, have a hankie. Thanks. You keep it. Dad around? We should say hi. Oh, let him come down in his own time. Well, go through. Granddad's is in front of the telly. Kate and her Scott will be here soon. Full house this year. You are staying? Please say you will? - Um... - We'd love to. Now you may remember from yesterday that we were getting some isolated reports of powers surges from areas in the midlands and north west of the country. Those reports seem to be increasing and are now coming in from other areas - Annji. of the country as well. Let us take a look at some of the pictures - that people have been sending in... - Merry Christmas, Gramps. Hi, Mister Milgram. I'm Annji. Nick's girlfriend. Merry Christmas. Uh... So how are we all getting along? Um... Well, I have to say, I didn't know you were coming. Oh, it wasn't definite. I mean... Don't have a pop at Mum, Dad. You know at work it is staff policy to put personal arrangements in writing about a month in advance. Well, it really was a last minute thing. Besides, our mobiles are conked out, so... So, your phone wasn't working all last year then? Or the last three years, in fact? They're here now. That's what counts. Ah, very well... good. It's my fault, Mr Milgram. I was on emergency cover shifts this week. I'm Annji. Nick's girlfriend. Very pleased to meet you, Angela. I'll get started on the tea. I'll let Mum know we're here. Hello? Hello, Mum? Hello? Shit. With diplomatic efforts now seemingly completely stalled with regards to the crisis on the peninsula. How much do you think the actions of these Russian pilots and the... You kept all the decorations. Yes, well, they're not broken, why replace them? They bring back good memories. Dad. Do you remember that Christmas with the power cuts? We decorated the tree by candlelight. You picked me and Kate up so we could hang the baubles. Well, maybe this year we can have a proper family Christmas like we used to, yeah? I better go see if Mum needs me. It's nice he likes his fairy lights. Funny, I was in the military police for thirty years and look how you've turned out. You're a clerk and your son's a deadbeat pansy. Mind, a few good slaps sorts that out, doesn't it, eh, Squelcher? I said, a few good slaps... I'm an Office Manager... I'm an Office Manager. Smells good, Mum. Oi! You'll spoil your dinner. Merry Christmas! Oh, everyone's here. I am so happy! Aw, Mum! Oh, Gramps, love you. Smile for the camera. Give us good gums, Gramp! Oh, hey. Hey, Sis, long time no see. Oh, you're not far off? Annji, did you meet Scott? You'll have lots to talk about. He's in medicine, too. Oh cool, where? Freeman Hospital. You? Saint Mark's Ambulance Service. Kate's due in a week. Two weeks. But you're okay? No back pain? Gushing? Hand swells? No, but I'm in an utter flap about the holidays. I mean, you hear all these stories on the news about foreign cover doctors... I'm so sorry. It's fine. No, I don't want you to think... It's fine. Who wants tea? Alfred? Nick? Six letters. "Tumult." That's not a real word! It really is. Indian words don't count. It's English. Shall I get the dictionary... again? Don't be silly. It's just a bit of fun. Have a Gulab Jamun. That's our shopping precinct! Oh my gosh! ...this afternoon. It's now been confirmed that one person has died and a further two remain in hospital with serious injuries after a stabbing incident just off the main high street the police are saying could be a suspected terrorist incident. We're now also getting reports that a man has been arrested... Well, ain't no surprise to me. Really? I read, I know what's going on. Alfred, please. Letting anyone come flooding in. Was always going to end like this. Gramps, you can't say that. Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, but still. Mr Milgram, I know we've only just met and I don't know much about your life, but that's not fair. You're right, you don't know anything about Gramps! Kate, please, let's not blow it out of proportion. Gramps is being out of order. This country used to be great, till all them Johnny Ahmed's and Bobby Bongo Bongos started coming in. All I'm trying to say is that if we let these things go, then we're perpetuating those views. How patronizing. Who do you think you are? Kate, you can't fucking seriously be siding with Gramps? Please don't swear, love. You come into our home... Kate, I'm warning you. Don't you shout at my girlfriend. You come here with your tumults and your bloody pumpkins in syrup... Kate, shut the fuck up! Hey! Alright, that is enough! You'll apologize. Me apologize? Now! I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. Mum... It's not you. It's not. It's... Well, it's not you. Annji, treasure, please, they didn't mean anything by it. Mum, this was a mistake. You won't go? Please don't. Come visit us in the New Year on your own or something. Shit, Annj. I never thought it would kick off like that. I don't want to stay. Look, here's what we do. Tomorrow we'll get up really early, before they do, and we will just go home, and we'll order a turkey pizza and watch Christmas Dr Who. Yeah? Now, I'd better get back to my room because, as you know, two people outside of Christian wedlock should not share a bedroom. You better drive. My head feels fuzzy. Yeah, mine too actually. Whoa... What is that? I think it's metal? The surface is so weird. Looks like it's been fitted on purpose... kids? Then what's that? Nick? I was having a nightmare. There was this awful banging. Is there anything to get this thing off? Tools? Crowbar? There's an axe in the garage. Mind out. Stop! Stop! Please, the neighbors will hear. Let's get your dad, he'll know what to do. Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear us? Help! Help! What in the hell is all this racket? Someone's locked us in. What are you on about? They're all the same. Well, this is nonsense. Nonsense. Am I the only one here with any sense whatsoever? It won't budge, Dad. Oh, this can't be happening. I'm giving birth in two weeks. It's got to be a natural disaster or something. But who would lock us in? Could it be a reality show? Some sort of awful game? That's it! That's got to be it. It's too insane to be really real. We could be on camera right now! No, it's the authorities. - You think? - Well obviously. There's been an incident and we've been quarantined until they regain control of the situation. I suppose. Well, you said it yourself, didn't you. I mean, these shutters are all metal. They surround the entire house. Only the government could manage something like that. It still doesn't explain the pipes. They poke into every room. Well, they could be there to vent in clean oxygen, couldn't they? Well, it's possible, isn't it? You know, there really are some ingenious people and sensible people working in the government these days, so believe me. So from now on we keep all the windows open, let the vents do their job. Let's let the air in. Scott, if you can help me. I'm calling the Police. I'll check the News. You all better come see this. It's overriding every channel. Well, what does it mean? It has to be the emergency government broadcast. In the aftermath of 7/7 we learnt that the authorities reserved an emergency frequency that would come into play in the event that the networks were knocked out. It's a nuke, isn't it! I saw it on the TV. It's the EMU pulse. Electromagnetic pulse. E. M. P. Oh, you think you're so clever. I don't think it can be. All the electrics would be fried. The TV would be dead. And our phones are still working, there's just no network. Well, why have all the clocks stopped working at the same time, then? I... can't answer that. I still can't work out how we all managed to sleep through it? Look, we haven't even checked online yet. That's the fifth try. Nothing. Dead. No internet. Landline's dead. No communication outside of this house. Scott? Yeah? Can I count on you, Scott? Uh yeah. Sure, Tone. No worries. You see I need to know you'll back me. We need to be shepherds. Protect the herd, even from themselves. We're men, Scott, and sometimes we're called upon to do things that no one else will. I say to my team at work, be your best on your worst day. Okay? - Yeah, Tone, sure. - Good. Careful. Okay, so we need to puzzle this out. Well, the message clearly shows that the authorities have the attack under control. So, we sit tight. Await for rescue. Right. No one said anything about an attack. It's Christmas Day. It's the perfect time to strike. The day of the year when our defenses are at their lowest. Lot's of them don't even celebrate Christmas. If it's an attack. - It's alright, love. - Careful. Careful. It's okay. It will be okay. Right, we need to wait for more instructions, but in the meantime, we are going to celebrate this special day as we would any other year. If we don't uphold our values and have a proper British Christmas the terrorists have already won. Here. Here. Dear Lord... Dear Lord, for what we are about to receive let us be truly thankful. We thank you for our health and the presence of our family in this trying time. We do not try to guess your grand design, but rather look to the example set by your son who was born on this day. He knew his duty. With your Grace we shall preserve and we shall prevail. Amen. What's wrong with her now? I've got a cold starting. Annji's got a touch of flu, Gramps. She got you wrapped around her pinky. Your cunt struck good and proper. - Alfred, please! - Dad! That was fucking bang out of order, Gramps! Apologize now! - Nah. Maybe Annji picked up something by accident? We don't know what's going on out there. Could be an infection like sarin or... Sarin's a nerve gas, not an infection. Or, or plutonium then. Also, not an infection. I know that! I'm not stupid! Look, let's just eat. We'll think a lot clearer with some food inside us. This is a farce. The world could be ending and we're shoveling sprouts into our faces. Oh, I bet it'd be different if it was one of your holidays. Can everyone please stop shouting? Look, come on, Mum's spent ages on this, it looks delicious. If I'm infected, then you are, too. You and laughing boy arrived after we did... Can you not have a go at us? We're a family and this woman is carrying my baby, okay. So, I've had enough, no more. Don't trust her! When I was stationed in the Middle East they had tricks to fool you. Gramps, you don't know what you're talking about, do you? You just carry on... - Be quiet! Please. Now, I'm about to carve the turkey. Ooh. Look! Well, there is nothing to discuss, because I refuse to entertain your clever notions that could put this family's health at risk. Dad. You are useless. Sitting there like a lump while my dad takes charge. What can I do? You're always telling everyone what a man you are. Here's your chance. Prove it. Protect your family. End of. Dad, it's our food. Oh, so now you know better than disaster management team, do you? All I'm saying is, lets take a step back, and take stock for a second... What are you doing? You know. Alright, but how long might this last? The TV said nothing about water and you can live for weeks without food. When I raised money for Comic Relief I ate nothing but energy bars for a month. The organizers were amazed. We've got a pregnant woman... Don't use me as an excuse! I'm strong. I'm a team player. We won't be able to risk the tap water, but I did instruct your mother to get some bottled water in for the holidays, so we'll ration that. Well, I hope that lasts long enough. - Oh, we'll cope. - Yeah. That's it, walk away. Don't you ever undermine me in front of the others again. You are no longer the head of this family. Alright, but it's not so easy when there's no head office to check in with, is it, Squelcher? Act decisively, with iron authority. Take him, he won't obey you when it really matters, you know. If you'd been harder on him as a lad he wouldn't have grown up to thumb his cock at authority. Didn't do you any harm, did it, Squelcher? It's changed again. "Decontaminate yourselves. Strip and scrub all flesh with household bleach." Beth, get the cleaning products. Do we really think it's an infection? We don't know what's outside. We should probably go through with it, just in case. That really is minging. See? Although, I did actually bring some decorations from downstairs up here. I don't understand why we're doing this. Well, because there is a chance that some of the poisonous dust might have settled on our bodies, in our hair. We may have walked it into the house. It could be on our clothes. Do you remember when we were first married, how we used to take baths together? What are you doing? This isn't a game, Beth. It's life or death. Right, so, I suggest we start with our armpits and crotch, and go from there. It could be terrorism though, couldn't it? Yeah, and if it is, we'll get through it together. We're a team. You okay in there, Dad? I can still scrub my own balls! I'll be down the hall if you need me. Will you come downstairs, please? Your mother has persuaded me that... sometimes I'm too hard on other people because of the high standard I set myself. Ha! Well okay, we've all been under a lot of pressure so, I'm sorry, too. Well, I didn't say I was sorry. Everything I have done has been to help this family. Okay, then I apologize. I'm sorry, too. I was nervous about meeting you... Annj, no. No, leave that for me, please. Hypodermics. Okay, who is going to do it then? It's not sealed. These have been used already. No. It is for our own good. It really isn't. Let's just talk about this sensibly. It's an order. It's a fucking teletext page. Do you know how dangerous unsterilized medical equipment is? Dad. I'm fine. Who's next? Okay, they're sterilized. Come here. Cowards. Dad, be careful. Mum, please don't. Beth, we're just trying to keep everyone safe. Come on, babe. Your turn, you can do it. The baby... I can't risk the baby. You've got to do it. Don't say that! Don't tell me what to do! Come on, you saw the message. It's the only way we can make sure everyone's safe. No, no. Dad, please don't make me choose. I can't. Kate, don't listen to them. We could risk losing both of you. Be quiet. You heard what Annji said and she's the only one with any medical training. We don't know what's in those syringes, do we? I'm warning you. All of you! Y-you're pulling at me like dogs fighting over a pork chop! I can't breathe! Just... let me think. Good girl. Two left. Annj, we don't have a choice. Good. Now we're safe. Dad? Dad? Oh, no! Dad? Dad? I told you! I told you! It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't... It doesn't make any sense. W-what about the rest of us? I mean, that stuff is in Kate and my baby! You told us it would be okay! You promised! He was an old man and old men die. Are you trying to say this was a coincidence? Well, maybe the same thing would have happened to us, if we hadn't taken it. It just didn't work on him. Maybe it was an allergic reaction? You've got to be kidding me. No, but it's possible, isn't it? He died because the medicine didn't work? I will not have my, my father's sacrifice undermined. Now we all took the shot and only Dad was affected. We don't know why and that's all we know right now. If we hadn't taken the drug, we might all have died. So this, this, this is... well, it is an acceptable loss. What slot? Right. Scott, go upstairs and get some sheets to cover the body, and collect up all the syringes. We can't carry on like this with your dad in charge. We have to find a way out. There must be something we've missed. It's everywhere. Help! Help us please! Help! Help! Argh! Ah! I just can't understand how it's happened. Take another swig, babe. It'll be okay. It'll be okay. It'll be okay... Oh God, oh God, oh... What an end to Boxing Day. Bye, Gramps. Squelcher. What? Squelcher. You called me Squelcher. Why? "Because you wet the bed." Just once, when I was little. Why? Because I was scared. I was scared of waking you, by flushing the chain after curfew. You heard me crying and you let me lay there all night. And in the morning, you battered me blue. "Real men can hold it." You see, I live with the understanding that there's a greater purpose than myself. Everything happens for a reason, even this. Dad. You have no idea what it's like to be a father. Always trying to choose the right path. Always worried about your children. Even when they vanish for years without calling. He knew. I know. You don't know. Who's next? Squelcher. The baby... I can't risk with the baby. Come downstairs. There's something we need to discuss. It doesn't say who is infected. So how do we know? It doesn't have to. It's obvious. It's a cold. She had it before she came here and she's got a name, Kate! Calm down, Nick. This isn't a fight we can win. Well, you said it. Kate, if you weren't my sister, I swear... Oi, don't even think it. You are risking everyone's life. Angela clearly contracted something on her emergency shift. Who thinks Annji's the one we should quarantine? Don't do it. Don't you dare. Mum, say something, please. Mum. Mum! The majority has spoken. - Scott, get her. - Put her upstairs. Nick, no! Get off him! Ding dong, merrily on high In heaven the bells are ringing Ding dong, verily the sky Is riv'n with angel singing Gloria... Shush... shush, shush. - Hosanna in excelsis. - It's okay, Beth. You can't lock her in there with Granddad's body! We hung up a sheet round it. Oh, like a plague ward? We have our instructions. Isolate the dead. The infected. No. Nick! It's okay. I've been around dead people before. Please. Annj, you okay? I love you. Do you believe those pipes are to feed us air like your dad says? No. Me neither. I don't think the messages are a government broadcast. It's almost like they're reacting to what we do. That's a bit of a leap, Annj. Think about the timing though. Every time we overcome a problem it comes back with something worse. Exactly. It's like there's someone watching through the TV. I think you should try switching it off and on. Just to see what happens. No. No, I could never do that. That TV is Dad's life line now. You have to try, Nick. I know you can stand up to him. Annji, what if I to turn it off and it just stays on? Uh... You okay? Yeah. What you doing? Well, I need to pee. I always need to pee. Ah! Oh God. you're not? Is this... Baby's just doing a tango. Could I? I mean... Oh, I felt it. It's amazing. Anyway, I better... Don't want to gush everywhere. You're not the boss of me. Ah! What are you doing? It's nothing, Kate. I am just testing a theory. Don't you patronize me, you prick. It's been the same since we were kids. You think you're so clever. You think you can do anything you want. You're not better than we are. - Kate... - Dad'll put you in your place! Just you wait and see... - No, no, no, Kate. Dad! Nick's broke the telly! What have you done? I'm just testing something out, Dad. What have you done?! Come on, come on, come on, come on... No. Come on! Oh, you couldn't leave it alone, could you? You always have to be right! Calm down! Nothing happened! Me and my baby could suffer penalties because of you! - Stop! - Don't touch her! Go on! Get him! Get him, Scott! Ah! Kate! Do something! Help her! You have to do something! Stop shrieking, woman. Let me think! How did this happen? We need to let Annji out! She's a medic! Annji's infected! I won't risk it! - But Kate might die, Dad! - No! Scott, you work in a hospital... Scott, do you know what you're doing? You need to help us! Scott, she's your fucking wife! Help her! Watch her head. Easy. Easy. Scott? Scott, stop that! Come on. Come on. You need to help her. Hold her hand. It's alright. Mum, we need um, water to clean the wounds. We need uh, something to wrap it, you make her comfortable. Easy, come on. Easy! Scott! Painkillers. Painkillers, strong as we have. Come on! T-There's whiskey! There's whiskey! No alcohol, no pills! My baby! Okay, one second, I need one of those. Come here. Is-is she...? She's passed out. Now with a wound like this, she will slip in and out of consciousness. - Will the baby be alright? - I have no fucking idea. - Will you please stop... - Please don't swear, I know, but Mum, I don't know. I'm sorry. Alright, I'm going to work in the study. I don't want to be disturbed. What? Well, it's too noisy down here, and you might be right. I think we need a different approach. A new plan. Dad, you can't go, it's Kate! Dad?! Fucking coward! Okay... um, easy, easy. We need some water or something, Mum. Scott, come on! Come on! Shush, shush, shush, hey! Oh, this is ridiculous. She's my child! Your sister. Um... hello. If you can hear me, I'm Beth. Beth Milgram. I'm with my family at 25 Stanford Street. We-we know you're busy but we've had an awful accident. My daughter Kate, she's broken her leg. It's when, when the bone... Nick? - It's a compound fracture. - It's a compound fracture. You sent the syringes. Please help us again! She's my daughter Kate. She's pregnant. We love her. I'm begging you... Please help. The, um, the skin's tight and there's... red streaks in the, uh, the-the veins that, the veins that are coming away from the wound are dark. Nick, the wound's infected. Sounds like sepsis has set in. If we don't get Kate medical attention soon, she'll die. What about the baby? No. - Mum, please... - No. I don't believe that. I won't. I can't believe that. I can't, I can't, I can't. We'll talk about this later. I've got a lot of work to do. - Mum, look I... - No. I've got to get busy. Mo and the boys are coming tomorrow and the place is such a tip. That's not going to happen, Mum. Merry Christmas! Aw, everyone's here! I'm so happy. Aw, Mum. Aw, Gramps, love you! We, um... We picked out names. We had Lewis if it was a boy and we had Ruby if it was a girl. Scott, the only way Kate will recover is if we get help. We have to escape. We must follow the leader. Be shepherds for the flock. Our "leader" has locked himself away. We can't rely on him. Scott, we have to stop fighting and work together. There was, um, there was something else... when-when Kate got hurt and she was screaming. I-I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me, but um... The message changed when I was staring straight at it. What did it say? "I see you." Dad? Dad! Kate... myself and Annji. Annji? Scott, come with me. No. You didn't help Kate. You locked yourself away and you hid from us. I'm Kate's father, and don't you think I've been spending every second trying to find a way to help her? Scott, be your best on your worst day. Come on. Dad, you've got to see this. Right. Dad? Dad! Stay calm. Scott. Nick! Nick! Are you okay? What now? Um, well, go and see what the television says now. Dad, please. Look at the phone. There's something going on out there. Be quiet. You've caused enough trouble already. That was an accident. But I... I can't explain it. It's not natural. The house is surrounded by... snakes or something. I don't know. What is it? What? You think I'm a bumpkin? Is that it? No, Dad. Dad... Dad. Da... Well? Any new orders? Dad, this is insane! We have to stop listening to the TV. Dad? Well, um, we'll start at the beginning. Who sent you? - No one. As expected. How long have you been plotting this? Stop talking like that, I'm your son! I'm your son! Scott? Scott! Dad... Dad... Scott... Dad, stop, please. Nick! Let me out! My own son, a sleeper agent. Was it Annji, Nick? Did she turn you? Look, I think he's had enough. He doesn't know anything! There's something else going on. Look at the phone. Just look at the phone. All of this started after you came back. I don't trust you anymore, Nick. I don't trust you. You don't have to trust me. Just watch the clip. Don't! I won't let any of this nonsense put me off anymore. We'll take an eye. That will make him talk. T-Tony are you sure? I mean, that's that's his eye! Fuck! You don't get it, do you? It's a twisted fucking experiment. We've done this to ourselves. Don't let them manipulate you. You were always too clever for your own good. Tony! She's dead. My Kate is dead. No... No! She's not! This changes nothing. In... In war there are always casualties. You fucking arrogant fool! All these years together you have never listened to anyone else! I hate you! Okay. It's alright, don't worry. Okay. Careful. Easy, easy, easy. Just gently. I am so sorry, love. I'm so sorry. Ah! Annji! Annji, you're in danger! Get back! Nick, hurry! Skull and crossbones are appearing in the rooms! Okay... the key. Scott, get Dad's key! Tony, where are the keys to the guest room? Think, Tony! Come on, the keys! - I don't know. - Think, Tony! There's a spare set in the kitchen. Scott? Nick? Nick? Hello? Is anyone out there? Nick, can you hear me? Scott, come on! Got them! Hurry, Scott! Nick? Fuck. Nick? - Mum? - Nick! Nick, the door's jammed. I can't open it. Okay, just pull the handle and I'll push. Okay? Nick, there's smoke coming in! Give me your cardigan. Nick! Oh! Nick! Nick! Give me your cardigan! Quick! Mum, just get back from the glass. Nick... Mum! Nick... you have to go. No, Mum! Mum, just get back from the door! Please, Mum. Mum! Mum! No! No! Ah! Mum! Mum! Mum! - Nick, we have to go! - No! - We have to go! - No! Mum! Mum! Stuff the gaps! Dad, the smoke will kill us! Fuck you! It's stopped! This is bullshit. You're not the boss of us! Dad, what are you doing? Is this him? Have I been wrong all this time? Whatever rubber band was holding your brain together just snapped. Mum is dead. Dad, don't you care?! If this is you, Lord, show us. Show us your hand truly upon us. Kate's stomach moved! Don't be so fucking cruel. Good God. Her belly's still warm. The baby's still alive. W-we have to try a C-section! This is the sign. The innocent is saved. We should give thanks. I'm not worshipping that thing! Don't you see? It's so clear now. We've were guided all along. Tested harshly, yes, but found worthy. Those are our baby names. Scott, come on. Scott, if there's even the slightest chance... In the... In the room, I found an old TV. I opened the back of it... there was something inside. Something living. Like a creature? Like a heart beating. What if that same thing is in the TV out there? What if it's in every TV? We believe in the true Lord, Jesus Christ. The only son of God. God from God. Light from light. True God from true God. Who was crucified by Pontius Pilate, and on the third day rose up again, in fulfillment of his brisk journey to heaven... ...but he will rise up again, and he will rise up in full glory and judge the living and he will judge the dead and his kingdom will last forever. Through the darkness of the valley we've rescinded into salvation, revelation, rebirth. Ah! No, ah! Annji! Let go! No! No! No! Dad, please, don't! No. No. No, please don't... - No, ah! - Dad, please! Dad, please don't do this! Scott, I swear to you. I'm the only chance for your child. Let me perform a cesarean. She needs you. Come on, Scott. Come on. Easy, Dad. Go! Go! Be quick! Cut it out! Do it now! Stop him first! Scott! Go! Scott! No! We have to follow the rules. Ah! Annji! You could never just do what you were told, could you, Nick? Ah! You had no choice. Ah! What the fuck is that? Ah! Ah! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Go! Go! Go! Go! It's okay. It's okay. Ah! Nick. Nick. You're not my Dad. Worship me. Worship me. Now or face your extinction. This is bullshit! Nick, what are you doing? Do it! Come on, kill me! Join with me. Become me. It can't kill us. It needs us. It's a parasite and we're the only ones left. Ah! Argh!
