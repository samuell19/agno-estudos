- The reindeer is known for its antlers and hooves. And its habit of landing on small children's rooves... Should a reindeer remain such a symbol of joy? Or should it be boxed up and sold as a toy? (engine) For this is the startling story I'll tell of the man who had everything... Christmas as well. Now some may be wise, well tutored or witty, but this Christmas Cracker has built a whole city... And all you can buy there, this fellow will sell... That Corporate mogul named Noel Noël! Yes, this is the terrible tale that I'll tell of titanic tycoon, Noel Noël! As soon as October's last leaves blow away, his season commences, the very next day... On the first of No vember, Noel Noël starts a new Christmas season by ringing the bell! And his grip on your wallet will not be relaxed till each pocketbook's empty, each credit card maxed! Now, down in the town lives the bold Murphy clan. And Noel Noël is a big Murphy fan. For Ma and Pa Murphy love Zoey, their daughter, and hope that she'll love all the presents they bought her. They'll spend till their pockets are barren and bare. And even the Murphy dog, Snooze, gets his share! And this year, old Noël has a marvellous plan to siphon the wages of this Murphy clan. (gasping) For reindeer can truly bring oodles of joy When packed in a box and sold as a toy... Yes, better than picture books, sweaters or sox. Is a real live reindeer, stuffed in a box! Despite his vast wealth, Noel would succumb to gloom and despair; yes, Noel was glum. An affluent fellow who wallowed in dread. With a purse full of gold, but a heart full of lead. And what was the cause of this wealthy man's woe? But a dreadful mistake made a long time ago! Young Noel had a dream, and he bought a small shop by a ponderous pine, on a hill, at the top. And that's where he laboured, constructing by hand the most marvellous toys ever seen in the land: Tow trucks and trains, and airplanes, too, from wood, held together with dowels and glue. And Noel would never look up from his work and so ne ver noticed a presence that lurked at the window... A face that was comely and fair. Yet Noel Noël remained unaware. Though Noel made wonderful to ys in his shop, no customers came; the place was a flop. Although he stayed open on Frida ys till nine, the locals were spooked by the ponderous pine. "This business is bankrupt!" Cried Noel with a scowl. "It's time to cut losses and toss in the towel!" (faint laugh) But before he got past the first snowdrift or two, He encountered a lady with glasses who flew! Bespectacled Beatrice. She was a fairy, and beautiful, too, if your taste is librarian! "Fear Not! Don't whimper and whine! "I'm a fairy, and all will be fine! "For many an elf, not to mention myself, "do dwell in the ponderous pine! "Behold: This stick that you see "is a twig that's cut from the tree! "With this wand long and supple, "your sales will quintuple. Activate it by you kissing me. "There is, of course, one little catch... "An addendum we cannot detach! A curse will befall "if the tree's hurt at all by an axe "or a saw or a match!" Back to the present! No more reminiscing! Check and re-check so that nothing is missing! 'Tis the night before Christmas! No musing! No naps! Just work yourself into a total collapse! Beware if you sleep and remain in these halls. At the first stroke of midnight, disaster befalls! The man who owns Christmas cannot feel the joy that he once must have felt when he was a boy. Noel isn't happy; he's cranky and weepy, for each Christmas day, he's condemned to look creepy! He's also pursued... Good Gravy! Gadzooks! ...by elves who for some reason turn into spooks! They're not paparazzi and surely not fond of Noel Noël! They're after that wand! Now the Murphys are perfectly happy this day, with their piles of presents and carols and play! A time for a game, a story, a joke and forgetting their woes, like the fact that they're broke. (stomping) But Noel, so ghastly, assaulted by loonies, must co ver his form and hide in the boonies! And what, once again, was the cause of his woe? Once more we'll return to that long time ago. When he pledged to the tree and smooched with the fairy. Soon all the townspeople ceased to be wary. They flocked to the shop and took all he could sell, all the things he had made and back-orders as well. But Noel was distracted. Not noticing this, his mind was consumed by the Beatrice kiss. For Noel now felt a mysterious urge. Her kiss had been more than a corporate merger. Of giants and demons, a man may be wary, but woe to the bloke who's been smote by a fairy. Noël in business was sharp and meticulate. In matters of love, he was quite inarticulate. If his tongue remained tied, then words would not win her. What would work? Fancy wine? A sumptuous dinner? No, better than that! He'll win her heart with a gift. A Noëllian work of fine art. Oh! A reindeer the size of a gerbil! So organic, so wholesome, so herbal. A gift is a start in expressing the heart. But a lady prefers something verbal! If something in you has awoken, a gift can be only a token. Let me give you some tips. Move your mouth, move you lips. For the words of the heart must be spoken. But Noel could not fathom; he had no rebuttal. The concept expressed was too complex and subtle. What difference do words make? Who cares what is said when one can have diamonds and rubies instead? And Noel did wonder, yes, wonder and weep. She didn't like gifts that were hand-made and cheap. But Noel had a notion, an inkling, a feeling, that raising his profile would make him appealing! And, what would appeal to both angel and witch? She'd love him if he became stinkingly rich! So Noel sought love through lucre and power and, grabbing a pencil, made plans for a tower. Ignoring the fact, as he drew his design, that this great Christmas castle precluded the pine! - Aaah!!! Aaaaah...!!! - Then out of the stump, a substance was spewing. Could it be... This was young Noel's undoing? It wasn't a virus. No, something much worse! Young Noel was hit by a conifer's curse! And back in the present, his memories churning, old Noel is filled with a terrible yearning. He's lost his ideals, good looks, and what's more? He's now lost the specs that once Beatrice wore. (radio playingJingle Bells.) (humming) (barking) (giggling) "My life's turned to ashes. "It just isn't fair!" And Noel Noël cries out in despair. (crying desperately) Then, off in the distance, by chance, who should hear this echoey cry, but a tiny reindeer? Poor little Zoey did splutter and moan! Her best present ever, the reindeer, had flown! Reindeer may come and reindeer may go. But not my reindeer, cries tough little Zoey! The reindeer ran to the Noël tower and burst the door with her arcane power. Though the weather's cold and snowy, undeterred is little Zoey! Nothing can head off the searchin' of this brave determined urchin. (baby crying) And just in case she needs a backer, Snooze the mutt will try to track her. (sniffing and barking) (speaking frantically) (singing) Yes, through the city, young Zoey roams. This kid's a regular Sherlock Holmes! And in the snow, she finds a clue: A pair of specs... and a monster, too! While some would flee with great velocity, confronted by a strange monstrosity. This child ignores his ugly features. She's kind to all misshapen creatures. But before even Snooze can arrive to protect her, they're both whisked away by a vaporous spectre. - Aaah!!! - Yes, this is the spot where the y finally drop with a stump right beside the remains of his shop. Zoey thinks that she's found her pet pla ymate at last, but to Noel it seems like a sign from the past. But this reindeer's a truly peculiar entity. Can a herbivore have a secret identity? (teeth chattering) A fairy and toy maker both made a vow, a promise, an oath. "By hackin' and hewin' this tree is a ruin! "You seem to have stunted its growth! "Moreover, you've been such a chump! "This tower is just a big dump! "Now take the great wand of which you are fond, "And plunge it into the stump! Now tell me: "Don't make me guess. Noel, it's time to confess!" "I hoped with vast riches, I could afford great gifts "for a lady I truly adored. "Still I worship this lady all others above, "for a fairy called Beatrice I truly love." "Good grief! The trouble with men "is simple stuff outside their ken! "The thing to do next is give me the specs "and repeat what you said once again." (barking) (laughing) "I love you, Beatrice." So Noel found love, with true joy and laughter. And together they lived happily ever after! You may not own the world Because some things were never meant to be But when you spoke that simple phrase It was magic words to me A simple Christmas tree On Christmas day May seem so very fine But we found love in falling snow Beneath a living pine Don't try to speculate Or analyze Snow flakes and diamonds Are the same I see them in your eyes Captioning by CNST, Montreal
