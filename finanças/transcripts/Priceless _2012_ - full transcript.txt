You're my lucky woman! I didn't steal any information. I'm sorry but you were wrong. We wanted to offer you a promotion. Did the people up top say something to you? I am no longer a chief. I got fired too. I wonder if she really did something bad? - The both of us. - Here you go. This new moon...will be Yamanaka Shikanosuke Yukimori. Uh, that's mine. Two ramen bowls isn't enough right? - Go ahead and order what you want. - Really? - I want fried rice. - Hey, wait a second! Yeah, we don't need rice, get some meat! That's not what I meant. Why are you treating us all of a sudden? For this. - You know him? - Yamanaka Shikanosuke Yukimori. - This completes my set of Warring States commanders - from the beginning to now. - Sure, you can take it! - So...go ahead! - Hey, wait! You - were giving it to me. - But you were just getting us two bowls of ramen. He's giving us a lot more, right? - I'll go with fried chicken. - Yeah, that's a good one! - Get some fried food. - Kindaichi-san... - Come on... - Give it up. - Come on! - Give up. You? Kimchi fried rice would be... - What's wrong? - What's up Kindaichi? - Sorry, I don't need any food actually. - Huh? - Would you hire me? - I forgot to take that down. No no, you don't even have to pay me that much. If you don't...I won't give this to you! Kindaichi, stop joking around! - Come on! - Hey! - You promised it to me! - Shut up! Think about the situation! Hey, Mister? Ah, I think it might break. No no, you'll break it! - Nobu. - Nobu-san? If there's no choice... Ah, really? Hey hey hey! - What! - All right! - I got a part time job! - Kindaichi! - What about our treat! - Shikanosuke is great! - Hey! - All right! Translation: Rollins Timing: furransu Priceless - There's no such thing! Don't be angry! When I get paid I'll take you guys out. Yakiniku then! Expensive one too! Got it. Anyway, now I don't have to keep paying by the day. Thank you. You always just make it to 500 yen. - Shut up! - I think the - rent is really cheap. - So are you - really staying at our apartment, miss? - Huh? What do you mean there's no rooms? We're full up here! Why are you surprised now? I thought you had space! What is she going to do? - Kindaichi's room. - Ah, yeah. Take responsibility for what pets you bring by. It's a woman. Haha, isn't that good? Well, if she wants to. - Here? Two of us? - Yeah. - Can't do it. - Right? Ah, about these wet tissues. We don't have a bath here. It really refreshes you. - Kindaichi, hurry up. - Be quiet. Well, if you think you can you're welcome to leave anytime. Before you get too used to things here. - So put this up here? - Yeah, okay. I've put this up for now. Try it out. Thanks. - Bath? - No. - What bath? - Hey, that ramen guy. Is he really going to give you a job? It doesn't seem to be doing too well. You don't have to worry. I'll save up and treat you guys. But if you want yakiniku you need at least 10000 yen. I haven't seen a Fukuzawa Yukichi in awhile. By the way, you had 10000 yen what would you do? - 10000 yen! - Haha, what would you do? - I'd get a RC car. Kindaichi? - A RC car? Hmm, I don't know. You can do a lot with 10000 yen. Hey! You may be used to this kind of lifestyle. - But do you think it's okay? - It's? We were unfairly dismissed. Moai-san knows the truth but he kept quiet for a promotion. Don't you think that's terrible? Well, there's a lot going on. I don't really hate that guy. What? That guy... Oh, Nikaido-san, you're here. What would you use 10000 yen for? What would you do? - 10000. - 10000 10000! I'm not in any mood to celebrate just 10000 yen. Good night. Scary. Congrats on your promotion to headquarters! - Congrats! - Thanks. - Cheers. - Congrats Papa. - I was wrong about you. - He can do it. He's on the fast promotion track now! - Yeah. - Now you finally - have a job we can talk about! - Yeah. - Oh, no soy sauce? - No soy sauce. Good morning. Nobu-san, I look forward... - Enomoto, morning. - Good morning. Good morning Chief Moai. - Oh, morning. - Ah, sorry. HQ Chief, now right? Ah, you don't have to worry. Chief is fine. - Finished, what's... - Go shopping. Okay. Two green onions. Thank you for waiting! - We're having a limited time sale on vegetables... - Hey, watch out! Every bag is 100 yen! - Green onions, radish, carrots... - Green onions!? We've got every kind of vegetable! And let the sale begin! And we've got a good start, there go the carrots. Sorry sorry, green onions! Green onions! Ow ow ow ow! - Mister, do your best! - I'm trying here! Green onions? Or burdock? Radish too... Excuse me, HQ Chief. We need to get this out soon, could you double check it? Ah, this? Okay, sure. Hmm... Ah, this product here. - Yeah. - Oh, hello. What? Are you okay? Ah, Director Zaizen. Good work, HQ Chief Moai. Ah, there's no need for that. How's the new job going? I'm not used to it just yet. - Don't be so humble. - Ah, but really... How about we have lunch? There's a good eel place nearby. - Eel? - Yes. - Ah, of course. - Let's go. Well then... - Ah, excuse me. - Huh? - The documents. - Ah. - I'll do it right after I get back. - Okay. - Sorry. - You have to have eel for lunch. Did you hear about Nikaido in accounting? Yeah, she was stealing data too. They forced her out of the company dorms. I heard that she was falsely accused though. You don't have to finish it. Oh, no, meals and pay is a big help to me. But, not too many customers today. It's always like that. So many troublesome stories, all these rumors flying around. Haha, of course. Anyway, time for eel. Hello. Yes? That quickly? Okay. Sorry, we'll have to have eel next time, Moai-kun. Oh, no problem. I look forward to next time. Yes? Yes yes yes. So what? Tell me before the eel then. - Hello. - Here? Ah, no of course not. Over there. Huh? Thanks for waiting. The next two please. Thanks for coming. - Is the ramen good here? - Yeah, not too bad. - And it's cheap. - Ah, thanks. Hey, excuse me. You shouldn't cut in line... I'm not! You can get in at Seishunken right now. Ah, that place is no good. It used to be good. But the guy there doesn't even try anymore. Ah, I see. You really know it well. - I used to go there a lot. - I see. - How about Seishunken? - No, thank you. With Kindaichi? That place I spoke about. The old, tiny apartments. Won't you talk about what you know? - What do you mean? - Don't play dumb. There's a hidden reason behind Kindaichi's dismissal, right? - I don't know anything. - I know they probably promoted you to keep you quiet. But you can't leave things like this! They might get rid of you next! I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I really don't know anything. I don't have the confidence to fight the company. Tell Kindaichi that. Kindaichi-san believes in you! - Excuse me. - Thanks for the meal. - Thank you. - How much? - 600 yen. - Here. Thanks for the meal. Thank you very much. Nobu-san, he left a lot. We still get the money. But really, I mean... Maybe you should a ramen people finish? - Then you'll get more... - We still get the money. But you're losing to that other place. Ah, right. It's really popular. Homemade noodles with flying fish broth. Looks good, right? - Yeah, it does. - I heard this place had really good ramen back in the day. - So maybe... - Wash. Okay. Everyone, thanks so much for coming today! My arena audience, can you feel my energy? It's been two years since my debut, I've been walking with everyone... Oh, you came at a great time! - Here. - What's this? Clean the hallways and toilets. With that stupid girl. - Who is that girl? - So please listen! Tomizawa Moe's debut single, "Yaoya Good!" Ah, what are you doing!? The audience was so excited too. - Audience? - A concert in her head. It was my first dome concert today! Dome? This isn't a dome... - Ah. - Huh? You're so cute! - Maybe you want to make a group with me? - Huh? Kindaichi-san believes in you! Eel or work? What's more important? Hey hey hey! - What if he's here? - Is it okay? - It's fine. - But, Moai-san, the president and Zaizen-san have really been interested in him. Moai-san doesn't have the power for that kind of job. I mean, Moai-san has no presence. Yeah, he doesn't. - He's 1000 yen. - Exact change. Thank you very much. - Hmm, just plain. - Missing some flavor. Don't act so mighty. That was just the second customer today. - This place isn't that popular. - He can hear you! - We'll close up for today. - But, there's still so much time. Hey, Nobu-san. How about making your best ramen tomorrow? - Why? - I'll bring customers. Take down the curtains. Hey Kindaichi, what are you going to do about today's 500 yen? Hey, do you think she'll wait - until I get paid? - How about you borrow - from that lady? She seems serious. - Lady? 1 2 3 4 5 6 7, bang! We have this. And this. - A street idol. - These clothes, and these pictures! It'll get a lot of money. I think Saya-san could get 10000 yen. 10000 yen? Huh if you just sell these you'll get 10000? We're not selling them. It's embarrassing. Yeah, embarrassing but actually really good. - You really got into it. - Ah, give them back! - Ah, come on. - This is cute too. - Hey? - Huh? I have something I need your help with. Huh? - You think this will help? - You have to try at least. Uh, you said I could help? Ah, passing out flyers. Pass them out in that costume. - It'll have big impact. - Huh? Hey. - Stop joking. - It looks good though. - Yeah, it's a good look. - Yep. That's not the problem. I'm busy. I'm thinking about how to get back with my old company and my old life. That sounds tough. No, I mean, you need to network in the company. I met with Moai-san today. What did he say? He's terrible. Said he had no confidence to fight the company. I don't think he's what you think he is. You should complain to him directly... I have to take care of this first. How about making your best ramen? Come to Seishunken! We have good ramen. Come to Seishunken! Ah, ramen. Seishunken. It's really good. - You're scary! - I'm not scary... - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Seishunken, it's good ramen! Here. Come to Seishunken! Come to Seishunken! Ah, Moai-san, you surprised me. - Did you find a new job? - Ah yeah. From yesterday. Part time. Ah, please. But the place is dirty. And we don't get any customers. - Are you okay? - I guess I'm doing okay. Nobu-san over there. He doesn't really try though. I'd like to see him try. But we'll get that place popular again. Ah, back to work! - Kindaichi. - Yes? Is there anything you want to tell me? Ah right! Congrats on your promotion. - Congrats? - We'll celebrate at my place next time. I don't have much so it won't be too big. Haha. Anyway, please come to Seishunken. Come to Seishunken! - He looks well. - President!? Will you come with me today? Come to Seishunken! Nobu-san. It's going to be busy today. So please do your best. This is strange. Wait a bit longer, it'll be packed! So...until then. Of course it was all pointless. Ah, sorry for not contacting you in awhile. I'm sure you've been busy recently. - No. - We used to work quite a bit before. President Hayashibe was a big help to us back then. Miracle Thermos has always been - one of our best customers. - Let's - get to business soon. - Ah, sorry. I'm here today to tell you we're going to suspend - our dealings here. - President? - What are you saying? - Since this year your company has been failing. Even with our relationship there is risk in dealing with a company with management and stability issues. That's all. Let's go, HQ Chief Moai. Okay... Please wait! If we lose Miracle Thermos that will be the end of our company! We'll change the prices! We'll do anything! The decision is final. Please understand. Moai-san...Moai-san... - Come on, stop it. - Moai-san. President. Why did you bring me? I want you to understand how I do things. In today's world, in order to protect yourself you should get rid of the weak instead of waiting for them to get stronger. When dealing with people or clients, there's no room for feelings to get in the way. I know that you'll understand, HQ Chief Moai. Hmm. Kindaichi-san. It's not that good. - Don't say that! - Stop it. You're the one who called - and told me to come here. - Why just you? Bring those other guys you're with. That guy with the face like a rock. I can't use your name at work. - Ah I see. - And anyway. Since the new president came in, it's been weird at work. It's all about results now. There's so much rumors and gossip flying around. Hmm, sounds tough. Even though Chief Moai got promoted, it's gotten worse. - Why? - Well, the President and Director always follow him around. You're really throwing out the gossip. - Ah, excuse me. - Yes? Do you live here? - Yeah. - Ah, is Fumi-kun... I mean, Kindaichi-san here too? - Ah yes. - Really? I think he's at his part time job. - Part time? - If you'd like - I can show you where. - Hey hey hey. Hey, wait. - Huh? - Ah well... You seem to know a lot about him. Ah well, we used to be at the same company. Actually, it's his fault that I'm living here now. Now we're in the same room. - Same room!? - Yes. By the way...who are you? His girlfriend. - Huh? - Excuse me. Ah, hey! Wait! Ooh, that was quite a fight. Haha. Don't say such strange things. - Good evening. - Ah, sorry, we're... - Ah, what is it? - Hmm, well... Someone saying they were your girlfriend came by. Yoko-chan? Did she see the apartment? Yeah. I told her you weren't in cause of the part time job. - You told her that? - Yeah. I told her I was probably going back to the company. And I think there may be a misunderstanding. - Misunderstanding? - Yes. Anyway, you should talk to her. It'll just be about my job. - How was today? - Hmm? - Work. - Ah. No results from handing out the flyers. This place is probably really bad. Does this place have receipts of supplies and sales? - Why? - Maybe we can check the finances here. You'll do this. Right? Wait. - Nobu-san. Nobu-san. - Hmm? She's a really good accountant and worried about this place. She said she'll look over your receipts. Ah, well... Maybe we should look again and the ingredient shopping? We can still use low priced ingredients for good ramen. It'll bring in the customers. - You don't have to come tomorrow. - Huh? I don't need any enthusiastic part timers like you. Here's the money. Please quit. I can't quit. I haven't brought in any customers. I haven't had your best ramen yet. You said before it's all the same if we get money. But I think if we can get someone to say "that was fantastic!" and leave with a smile, that's so much better, right? Nobu-san, come on make that good ramen. The one that everyone says "I had too much!" Nobu-san. Nobu-san? Huh? Nobu-san! What's wrong? Are you okay? - Hey! The phone! - Phone? - An ambulance! - Ambulance, right. Nobu-san! Nobu-san! - Ah, Nobu-san, are you okay? - You're in the hospital. Man, you really surprised me. Collapsing all of a sudden like that. - I had a stand at first. - Huh? Then at 40, I started my own shop. I wanted to make the best ramen in Japan. Maybe Seishunken was an embarrassing name but I kept at it. But more shops opened over the years, I had fewer customers. Seeing their faces eating my ramen and saying it was great made me so happy. But it was at the time I got sick and closed up for awhile. I figured I could open it and just not try as hard. But then the place next door opened up and they actually tried hard. That was it. I didn't have enough left. My dreams and desires disappeared. At any rate, I knew what it meant to make something good. I have good memories at that shop, but I think it's time. I'm sorry, but you'll have to have a new job. So you're going to close up shop like this? Then if it's over. Can you make your best ramen one last time? Please. - What are you doing? - Ah, well... I want to borrow some scissors. Here. Bring them back when you're done. Wow, she's good. What are you doing? Ah, again... Do you need that? - Yeah. - Why do you need it? More flyers? - It's going to close. - It's the last day. I want to bring it a lot of customers. But this is all I can do. Hmm... - Why are you trying so hard? - Why? I mean, you just found out about it recently. And he's going to pay you regardless. Why? I don't know why. - Hey. - Yeah? If you're not doing anything... Welcome back. Wow, you really cleaned up. Almost like it's not my place. Well, it's the last day. - Let's go. - Where? - Tsukiji. - Tsukiji? Oh! Tsukiji! Okay. Come to Seishunken, please! Come on... Seishunken! Please come! It's the last day! Please come! Wouldn't you like some ramen and beer with me? - Let's go here next. - Okay. - All right! Let's go. - Okay. - Hey. - Yes? - Try some? - But - you won't have enough for the customers. - That's not a problem. Ah. Well, okay then. Please come and have some ramen, gyoza and beer! Today is the last day! Please come! Come to Seishunken! - Ah! - You? - What's going... - Ah, no no... Don't look at me when I'm like this. Ah. The last day? Yes. If you'd like, please come. Kindaichi-san is doing his best up to the final moments. I don't know why, there's nothing be gained from it. - What time is it? - No one's coming... - Oh, a delivery call? - Yeah. Hello, this is Seishunken. Yes. Yes. I'm sorry. Goodbye. Oh, where? - It was a complaint. - Huh? They said to stop putting flyers in the mailboxes. Oh! You surprised me. Sorry. - Good work today Moai-kun. - Ah yes you too. You're free for the rest of the day, right? - Ah, yes. - Sorry for the sudden invitation but perhaps you'd like to go with the President and have dinner with Tokorozawa-sensei. - Huh, me too? - Yes. Ah, okay okay. - No one's come. - Even after we passed out all those flyers. Well, this kind of end suits this place. I'll take care of the rest by myself. Here's your pay. You'll forgive me if I'm a bit short. Thanks. Well, thank you very much. We've got to use that 10000 yen on yakiniku. - A RC car! - RC car? - No, yakiniku! - A sports car is fast! - Yakiniku! - No, sports car! We don't need that! We've been waiting for yakiniku. - A sports car is good! - We don't need a sports car. Kindaichi-san, what do you want to do? - Sports car! - Yakiniku is better! - It's fast! - They have kalbi. - A RC sports car! - Hey Kanta, Ryota. Sorry but I can't give you yakiniku or a car. Excuse me! Fried rice and chili shrimp! I want fried chicken, fried rice and gyoza. Could we be the last customers at this place? They really wanted to come. - Really! - Really! - Welcome. - Okay! Ah, today was quite a treat. Not at all. And thank you so much - for your time. - Of course. You're quite talented too. Ah... Look forward to seeing you again. That's very kind of you to say. Travel safe. It went very well. You did go in there. Ah, it was nothing. Keep it up for next time. Let's eat! - It's great! - Yeah, it's good. It's really good! This deserves a line. You used 10000 yen, so keep on ordering. Okay, I'll have gyoza and spicy tofu. - Sure. - Ah, right. We should get fried chicken and liver for grandma. We'll get that place popular again. Kindaichi-san is doing his best up to the final moments. I don't know why, there's nothing be gained from it. In order to protect yourself you should get rid of the weak. Kindaichi-san believes in you! Moai-san is definitely a guy we can trust. Moai-san? - Moai-san? - Oh! - You came? - Well... - Come in. - Really? - Come in. - Okay then. - Come on in. - Thanks. - Excuse me. - Welcome! - Good evening. - Moai-san, sit down here. - I think someone's here... - I'll bring some beer. Ah, the glasses. - We couldn't celebrate before. - Celebrate? Huh? Moai-san's promotion. Ah, close one. Here. And some for me. - Okay then. Ryota. - Huh? We're doing a toast. Moai-san, cheers! - Cheers! - Thanks. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Thanks. - Cheers. Ah, great. - Kindaichi, I... - Yeah? Go ahead, don't worry. - It's good. - Right? Beer after work is the best. Here's gyoza. Oh, and some beer? Oh, I'll get it. - You are? - I used to be his boss. Ah, must've been tough to have a weird guy like him as an employee. - No, not really. - But he's an interesting guy. Why did he quit his job? I'm sure it's lonely without him there. - Thanks for the meal. - Huh? You're going home? Hey, Moai-san! - Oh? Where's Moai-san? Bathroom? - He left. He didn't even apologize. Feels a bit weird. Hmm. - Well, at least he had a drink. - Here's the spring rolls. He left a little though. Was 10000 yen enough? 9980. I calculated while we were ordering. Wow. Of course you did. Ah, 9980 yen? What about my 500 yen rent? Man, that was the most important part! - What should we do? - Well, we'll do something. Huh? Where's Nobu-san? Nobu-san! Thanks for the meal. Thanks for letting me work till the end. Not at all. - Here. - Oh, really? Thanks. But really, your ramen was the best. - Really? - Ah, thanks. Let me thank you for this. Maybe you want to take over my place? Huh? Your place? What? The shop? I'm closing up here. I found a place in the country to go back to. What I want you to take over...
