You can't go to school on an empty stomach. Good morning Toona. Hi Toona. You're looking good. What is that? It's my record cover. Black Roses? It's just a record cover. Oh God. Oh you're just like your father. Tony, get up. You're going to be late for school, you lazy bum. And I suppose my mother works at the Beverly Hills Polo club? Your mother loves waitressing. She's been doing it ever since you've been around. I'm well aware. Julie, look Julie. Now, what's that supposed to mean, huh? That I don't take good care of your mum? You know I haven't heard any complaints from her lately. Evil. Evil propels me. And the reform of evil propels me. I stand indifferent. Well, it's hard to believe these words were written by the same Walt Whitman that talks about the beauty and perfection in a single blade of grass. What did Whitman mean when he said evil propels him? Forum. So, Whitman and evil. Johnny? Evil? Yeah Johnny, Evel Knievel. We're talking about Whitman and evil. Now Whitman says, that evil propels me. Is he advocating evil, is that what he's doing? Oh yeah, he's doing it alright. I understand exactly what he's doing. Well what exactly is it that you understand, Johnny? It's easy, it's happening here in this town with the Black Roses concerts. Yeah. Like here we got this whole town filled with people who claim to be good, right? Who go to church every Sunday, good God fearing people. Good, good, good. All this talk about good, and so now here comes the biggest thing to hit Mill Basin ever, and they try to stop it? You call that good? You see they figure there must be something evil about the band if we all like it. Yeah. That's what I think Whitman was talking about. They like evil, and they like getting rid of evil. They're ugh... Hypocrites. Hypocrites, right. Only what they think is evil, is evil. You know, they call the shots 'cause they're the adults. Yeah. I think Whitman was talking about Mill Basin. Yeah, he was a cool guy. Well, that's ugh, a very interesting monologue, Johnny. But I think you may have missed the point of the poem, perhaps. I think all Whitman was trying to say, though maybe in a back asswards kind of way. is that one should remain open minded. I don't think your parents want to stop the concert just to annoy you. It's just that they're afraid of change. There's never been a rock concert in this town. They probably don't know what to do with one. Well we know what to do with one. Enjoy yourselves. Have a good time for once. They don't understand what a great honor this is. They didn't have to pick Mill Basin for their first concert. They could have started their tour any where in the country. And this is the reception they get. Well it's your mom trying to stop the concert. No comity is going to stop concerts from being played in Mill Basin. Okay, now let's try to remember what Whitman said, huh? Let's keep an open mind. Maybe the parents comity is right. No, come on. Okay, maybe not. Maybe not. Okay pages 40 to 52 in your anthologies tomorrow. Aww. Aww that's right, 12 whole pages, it's tough out there. Oh Julie, aren't you going to class? Give it up. What'd ya mean? Oh come on. So I like Julie, so what's the big deal? No big deal. But I'd say she's taken. Your own papers now can I? I can't believe all the fuss in the paper. Have you heard anything about these Black Roses concerts, son now? A lot of the parents are raising a big stink about it. It's all they talked about down at the shop today. Jenny's dad came in for a haircut, he was telling me all about it. Sure pop, I just bought myself tickets to the first two shows. Are you sure you should go? Everybody seems to feel it's a bad idea. Janey's dad bought her a ticket. Oh he did, did he? Well, I guess it's alright then. Right. We're a good people here in Mill Basin. We are a church going people, and we are a law abiding people. Our police don't have to carry guns like they do in the big cities. And our children grow up to be fine young citizens we can be proud of. Because we have had no corrupting influences here to speak of. Until now. And now we find that disciples of the devil are invading our town, and threatening to steel our children away from us. Yes, yes. Their image. Their image alone has become a symbol of evil to our young. Their satanic music and subversive lyrics threaten to undermine the very fabric of our society. Would you care to hear some of their propaganda? Yes. You just listen to this, and you tell me if this isn't the work of the devil himself. Tear down the walls of hell, make room for lust to dwell, carry in your hands a sword, tear away the image of the Lord. What just a minute, wait a minute, that's not all. That is not all. Pull down society, only then can we be free, in the world alone to roam, destroy your happy home. Now if that doesn't say it as clearly as anything else... Now calm down. Folks just, excuse me Ellen. Folks just a minute. Now we're talking about music here. Not revolution. Now this group, this Black Roses. I'll be the first to admit, some of their stuff is a little antisocial. But that's the very nature of rock and roll, isn't it? Trying to shake us up a little bit? It's the very nature of poetry too, isn't Mr Moorehouse? Yes, ugh. Sometimes it seems so. Yes sir, Mr Mayor. See rock and roll is about rebellion. What about Elvis? Little Richard? Chuck Berry? Remember when he first came out, did your parents squawk? And what about the Beatles? Now let's don't forget the Beatles. Martin, do you remember when your boy grew his hair long like Ringo Star? They wanted to run that kid out of town on a rail. Now was he evil simply because he had long hair. No. Now are these Black Roses any different? Yes they are. Are you going to stop these concerts, Mayor Farnsworth? Now May there's not a damn thing that I can do about that. The school board approved the concerts. Is our good mayor trying to tell us that we have to just stand by and watch our children be brainwashed. No. I can't believe I got you to come out with me tonight. I had to get out of the house tonight. I appreciate the excuse. Thanks. What's bugging you, anyway? Is it your creep step-dad again? Or, is it Mr Moorehouse? What do you mean? Come on everybody in school knows that you and he are. What? I don't believe this, that's not true. Mr Moorehouse and I happen to be friends. Besides he's just about the only person in this town that understands me. Don't you know he's seeing Priscilla Farnsworth? Ha ha, the ice princess? Oh man. So you're just going to moon around after him, when you could be going out with me? Johnny. I have too much on my mind to be involved with you, or anyone else. Yeah sure, I understand. I mean I get down too sometimes. What's there to look forward to after graduation. Working for my father? Cutting frigging hair for the rest of my life? Johnny. That's why I couldn't believe that Black Roses would play here. I mean they never played out of the studio before, and they picked Mill Basin to open their tour? It was like a sign, that things were getting better around this hole. If they even get to play here. I mean it like every time there's something I really want somebody takes it away. Johnny. But tonight, I want to paint this town red. Johnny where are you going? Johnny what are doing? I said I was going to paint this town red, that's exactly what I'm going to do. Johnny. Johnny get back here. Johnny. Would you answer me, what are you doing? You're going to get in big trouble. I don't want any part of this. Johnny. Johnny. Look, just stick around, alright. You don't have to help, but just stand guard. Johnny. Johnny look, someone's coming. Oh shit. Jules, run. Wait. Johnny. Forum. Forum. John Pratt. What is Emerson's message in Self Reliance? Umm. Self Reliance means, Umm, just what it says, you can only rely on yourself. I mean if you let others do things for you, nothing will ever get done. Believe in your self. Have confidence. Take the bull by the horns. Take the bull by the horns, huh? Well you'd know about throwing the bull, wouldn't you? What about taking the law into your own hands? The law is alright, but sometimes it's too tough on you. Too tough. In fact it's real confining isn't it? I mean if you want to steel someones car, it'll stop you. Deface or pollute the environment. And you'll find your self up against stiff penalties. Yeah. It's real confining alright. Mr Moorehouse. Yes Tina. What's this have to do with Emerson? Well more than you think, Tina. More than you'd think. Well okay, have a nice day. See you later Mr Moorehouse. Take care Jeff. Mr Moorehouse. My mother left my father because he was afraid to take a chance on anything. I'm not going to let that happen to me. Julie. What the hell's with you two? Johnny can I talk to you please? What about? About last night. About last night. Come on. What's up? He knows. He just told me he knows. But he's not going to tell. Why not? I don't know why not. He said you were going through a hard time or something. Oh yeah, that's pretty funny. That's not fair, Johnny. He could have you arrested, you know. Oh right. And get you in trouble too? No way. Johnny, what are you doing? Are you coming or what? Wait I'll come with you. Matt. Thank you. Looks like this is the place to be. Brats here of all ages. Where's Priscilla? I think she's waiting for the Kingston Trio. I'd like to sing a song about my home. " by Black Roses) Well?

Janey? Johnny? What do you think Emerson's getting at here? Johnny? Julie? What did Emerson mean by the Red Slayer? Emerson? Ralph Waldo Emerson. Well. Guess we've done a lot of talking about literature in this class, but maybe not enough about life. You see it's not enough to just read Whitman and Emerson from your anthologies. You have to use what you read. Apply it to your lives and make it work for you. Well how is Whitman going to help me decide what to do for a living? No, no I'm not kidding. Because if he could help, I'd really be happy, because I have no idea. Well Tony the aim of literature isn't to tell what to do with your life, it's to tell you how to live it wisely. Oh yeah. What would Mr Whitman think of what you've done with your life? Well no, that's good. What would Whitman think of what I've done with my life? Well I guess, I guess he'd judge me by how successful I am at teaching. I'm not very successful right now, but ugh. Hey you kids can judge that better than I can. Hey get some sleep tonight, will you, please. Hey stranger, how'd you like the Black Roses show? It was wonderful. I'm going again tonight. Really? Did you win the lottery or something? They liked us so much they gave us tickets to all the shows. They gave free tickets to all the kids? All their fans, yeah. What's the matter with you today? Sit down. I got to tell you Matt, this is the first time I've had a teacher in here complaining that his kids didn't get upset over a homework assignment. Now you've got me worried. It's not my lessons, Sam. It's my kids. I mean last week, all they could think about was midterms. Now it's Black Roses. You too, I might add. You've been exposed to a taste of rebellion. It's only natural they're going to remain temporary under it's spell. But you know, as soon as these Burnt Roses leave town, they'll be back to normal in no time. Believe me. And if you don't believe me, why don't you go over, right now, and talk to this Fabian guy. Fabian? Yeah, and once you see that he's just another ordinary working stiff, you're going to see that you've been over reacting. And would you please make your move. Miss your album, now. You mother. Fight, fight, fight. Son of a bitch. Throw him, throw him, throw him. Why did you guys come to Mill Basin, anyway? Are you kidding, why did you decide to move to Mill Basin, man? Mill Basin is like a test case, you know. They figured on starting us out in a small town, since we'd never played out of the studio before. Well once before actually, but that didn't work out. Anyway that's why we decided to lay down four shows. We figured we'd work out the kinks for the act. The way I see it, couple of more weeks, we'll be ready to score some big time gigs. If the parents group doesn't run us out of town. Yeah, you heard about that, huh? Oh yeah. That's ugh, we expect that. It's kind of the nature of the rock and roll beast. Our music gets misunderstood all the time. People thinking it's ugh, pretty antisocial, you know? But they're wrong. If people would just listen to our music, they'd see we have a humanistic message for the kids. You know, social and environmental concerns. That kind of stuff. You heard us play. Yeah well, like I said, I just caught the beginning of it, that's all. Oh well. Then you can see for yourself. I bet they'll be no parents protesting tonight. No, no, they've all backed off. See. They had their preconceived opinions about us, and once they checked it out for themselves, they saw it was all hot air. I guess so. Hey Damien, come on. We got to work out the first set. Yeah, you got me man. Hey listen, come to the show tonight, and if you change your mind about rock and roll, I'll put you in touch with my agent. You'd be great. I'll see you tonight. Really, I can't. Oh I know, another date with the mayor's daughter? Guys got to move up in the world. Where are in the hell are you getting this stuff from? Are you kidding? You're a famous guy. Known your soul a long time, man. Well anyway I must be taking a lot of time out of your teaching schedule. Like expanding those little minds and all. Yeah. Yeah, you take care Yeah, see you.

Nice of you to call first. I'm sorry Priscilla, I'm here to see your father. Is he in? No. No, he's not here. Did you and Daddy have a date? Come off it, Priscilla. I am not in the mood. I need to talk to someone. Oh yeah. What about me? You wouldn't be interested. And what makes you think that? Because it's about my students. And when have you ever been the slightest bit interested in my students? I'm always interested in your little students. And their little books, and their little essays, oh and especially your little teachers pet. You leave Julie out of this. Oh so you knew exactly who I meant. Priscilla I, what's the use. I'm just wasting my time anyway. No your wasting my time. Do you know why I went out with you? Because when I met you I said there's a guy that's going to do something with his life. I didn't think it was going to be teaching a bunch of inbreed morons the alphabet. You know sometimes I find myself thinking like you. Thinking that maybe I have wasted my life, settled for less. But then I see those little students of mine, and I realize that I have made a difference... Oh come on, Matt. Shut up Priscilla. And maybe by your standards I am a disappointment, but at least I make an attempt. That's a hell of a lot better than a life that means nothing. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. I came here to see your father, and you got me going off on some tangent defending why I became a teacher. I'm going home. Or maybe to a bar. Yeah. Which ever I pass first. Fine. Do it Matt. Priss? Yes Daddy? Who's down there with you? Nobody. Good not Sonny. Later man. Was that you, Johnny?

Oh, oh. Well, I hope you're starting to get a feel for what the American transcendentalist writers are all about. Why do we have to study all these dead writers? I mean there's a poet alive today who writes rings around 'em. Damian. I'm tired of living in the past. I'm living now. Alright. I want you to write an in class essay comparing the use of metaphor... I said I want you to write I got it. Hello. Neal? There's something going on in this town, and you got to help me stop it. You sound like a hysterical Mrs Miller. Well if I was Mrs Miller I would be hysterical because Mr Miller is dead. Dead? Herb Miller's dead? I just ugh, just saw him at the town meeting the other night. Bad ticker? No, bad kids, bad music. Bad news Neal. Don't go off the deep end here. Where in the hell have you been? Tony Ames' mother is dead too. A hit and run accident. Only Neal I don't think it was an accident. Look I know it is a lot of bad news for one day in Mill Basin. Look Neal, you have to come with me to that concert tonight. Now I can't explain it, I think they're doing something to the kids. Controlling their minds. I, I can feel it Neal. Matt, you go to the concert. And if you still feel as strongly about it tomorrow, come on over and we'll do something about it. But, I've got to agree with Priss, she just thinks you're carrying this concerned teacher thing a bit too far. It's like it's become an obsession. For Christ sake's. I know you'll feel better if you and Priss get back together. I know you've had a little spat. This has nothing to do with Priscilla. Drop by tomorrow and I'll help you break the ice with Priss. Okay? Neal! It's a date, bye. Neal! I was sorry to hear about you father, Janey. What did he die of? Heart attack. Mother found him dead in the den this morning. About 3:00 am when she got home from bridge club. She felt terrible. Well I can imagine. She lost. Now Janey it's only natural that we try to suppress our grief when a parent dies. Unless we allow that grief process a chance to run it's normal course, it can come back in destructive ways later on in life. You're far better off getting everything out in the open now. As painful as that maybe. I guess you're right. What do you suggest? Do I suggest? Well, Ugh you could, you let your true feelings, your true feelings, just let them come to the surface. Don't, don't be afraid, don't try to suppress anything, you know. How did your fathers death make you feel? Can you describe it? Makes me feel like screaming. I'd like to open a window and scream at the top of my lungs. May I? Yes. That's a very good constructive suggestion, Janey. And it's a good start. Let's let you scream. You know I think it might do you a lot of good. You know I often thought of using screaming in my therapy, in my work. Great scream. Oh Julie. I thought I'd find you here. What are you reading? Oh it's nothing, just an article I'm writing. That's all. I hardly get to see you anymore. What are you talking about, I just saw you in class today. Are you feeling okay? I mean you, you just don't seem to be quite your self lately. I don't know what you mean. I couldn't be more myself. Umm. You're still going to the concert tonight? Of course. With Johnny? Of course not. Johnny means nothing to me. Well then what's the attraction? I mean the concert. I mean how do you go back night after night and listen to the same old song, huh? But that's what so great about it, it's never the same. Every night I find something different in Damian's music. Something really personal. I don't know, its like his music was meant just for me. Really? Yeah, I, I find that hard to believe. I'm disappointed in you Mathew. You must have read Leaves of Grass a hindered times. And why? Because you always find something new. Yeah. Julie I just don't think it's a good idea. I mean you've worked very, very hard this term, and now all of a sudden you're neglecting your studies, you're staying out late, and I don't want you to screw up your chances of a scholarship. Ah, who cares? I care. I care, Julie. I mean, I like you. You're a nice girl. Liking isn't good enough anymore, Matt. I need something more from you. And I know why you pull away from me. It's her. You don't know what you're talking about. There's no one in my life right now but myself. And that's more than I can handle. Julie? You are the Black Roses. The flowers of evil. You have been chosen to smite the soil with the sword of pain. Roses, roses, roses. We are one with things that prey, and one with what we kill. Roses, roses, roses, roses, roses, roses, roses.

Mmm, you really do know how to take care of your old step dad, don't ya? Yes, I do. Don't stop now. What a nightmare. Oh no. 10:00, I missed the concert. Julie. Julie? Julie! Oh, Mrs Sullivan I'm sorry. I was looking for, are you alright? I, I was waiting for the police. The police, why? What's happened? Well, Mrs Sullivan what's wrong? My husband, I came home from work and, there's blood all over the place. I, I.. Where is Julie? Where's Julie, Mrs Sullivan? I don't know where Julie is, I pray to God nothing's happened to her. I'll find her, okay? Oh, you're one of Matt's little students. Oh teachers pet. Neal? Priscilla? Oh damn. Julie? Matt, it's me. Neal, what is it? Something happened. There's been an accident. Her car caught on fire. She's dead. Her car caught on fire. And ugh, my little girl is dead. Priscilla? Julie. Mathew. I've brought you a present. What kind of present, Julie? Myself. You know I've always loved you. Julie you're just a kid. You don't mean that, I'm like a father to you. Julie no now, this isn't right. But Mathew. What are you doing? Julie what is wrong with you? But Mathew, I've taken care of everything. There's nothing left to stop us from always being together. Julie no. Julie I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What in the hell is going on here? Oh. Oh fuck.
