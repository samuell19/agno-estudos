Fishing was my life until the day he called me to follow him. Our journey revealed how great he is. He taught and did one just like no one else. I left everything behind to go his way and he gave me a new life, his life. The truth is for all to hear. Jesus, stop. What are you doing? You shouldn't be washing feet. You're not the servant. You're not going to wash my feet, not ever. Peter, if I don't wash you, you won't belong to me. Then wash my hands and head as well lord, not just my feet. I need only wash your feet, you are washed, completely clean. You call me teacher and lord. That is what I am. Follow my example by showing the same love I have shown you. Then the world will know that you are my followers. I look forward to sharing this passover meal with you before I face My suffering. I will not eat it again with you until its meaning is fulfilled in my father's kingdom. He thinks he's the son of god, king of the Jews. The Messiah. What he says is blasphemy. This is my body given for you. Eat it in remembrance of me. Drink from this, all of you. This cup is my blood of the new covenant poured out for you for the forgiveness of your sins. Judas, tonight is the night. Where did Judas go? My friends, the time has come for god to show his glory by what I am about to do. But I must do it alone. You can't come along now but you will follow later. What are you going to do? Why can't I follow you now lord? I'm ready to go to prison for you, even to die for you. You say you will die for me Peter. I tell you before the rooster crows twice at dawn, you will deny 3 times that you even know me. In fact, all of you will run away because of me scattering like sheep without a Shepherd. No lord, never. Even if everyone else falls away I will never disown you. Satan once deceived all of you like wheat. Peter, I have prayed that your faith will not fail so that you will be able to strengthen the others. Don't be troubled by all these, you trust in god, trust also in me. Soon I will leave to prepare a place for you in my father's house and when it is the right time I will come back in all my glory and take you to be with me where I am. No lord. You can't leave us, not now. What will we do without you? My friends, I'm not leaving you like orphans. My father and I will send you a helper, the holy spirit. He will remind you of what I have said and lead you to understand what I have done. I will leave you with a peace that this world cannot give. But now the ruler of darkness approaches. Don't be troubled by what will happen, I will overcome him. Go, follow me to the garden of gethsemane to pray. Stay here and keep watch. It really troubles me that Jesus would even think that we would abandon him. Scattered like sheep? Tonight the Shepherd that cares for us, doesn't he realize that he can depend on us? Why would he say we would run away? He's the promised Messiah we've all been waiting for. He has to be. No one could do the things we've seen Jesus do in the three years we've been following him. How many has he healed? How many demons has he driven out? Even power of a death. Nobody else has that kind of power. The high priests and teachers of the Jewish law continue to reject him. Why? Because of their power, their traditions, what people think of them. Those things are more important to them than the truth. But Jesus speaks with the authority of god. They don't want to hear it. I'm afraid they would try to find a way to get rid of Jesus. If it comes to a fight John, I'm ready to fight for him. I'm even ready to die for him. My dear father, if it possible, take this cup away from me, yet if the only way to save the world from sin is for me to suffer let not my will but yours be done. Let me bring you glory by completing the work you've planned for me. Couldn't you stay awake with me for just one hour? Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation for your spirit is willing, that your flesh is awake. The hour has come for the son of man to be handed over the powers of darkness. Master. Do what you came for. Put away your sword. Don't you realize that if I wanted to I could have called down thousands upon thousands of angels to rescue me, but how then will I accomplish the will of my heavenly father and drink the cup of suffering he has planned for me? This is what I came for. What is this? You're coming with swords and clubs as if I were a dangerous criminal or leading a rebellion. You did nothing when I taught in the temple. All this just confirms what the prophets wrote, so take me. I'm the one you want. Let these men go. What have I done? I'm afraid what they'll do to him or us. I couldn't allow this to happen to him. They must be taking him to the high priests' house. I think I can get us into his courtyard. Come on then, let's go. Just make sure you stay in the shadows. Did you see? We captured Jesus. He's in there. Did they get any of this followers? Not yet. They all ran away like scared little children. You are one of his disciples aren't you? No I'm not. He was. He was one of those with this Jesus. What? I don't know what you're talking about. This man, he was one of them. He was with Jesus. No I'm not. Jesus, I don't know him. Yes, you were with him. You're a galilean. You talk just like his followers, your accent gives you away. God curse me if I know him. I swear, I don't know this man you're talking about. You say you will die for me Peter. I tell you before the crows twice at dawn, you will deny 3 times that you even know me. I was sure Jesus would be the Messiah, the king who would lead a new era of glory but now that hope seems lost. Hanging on a cross, dying shamefully, punished like a criminal. After he died his body was placed in a tomb leaving us all feeling hopeless and afraid. Have mercy on me lord, I have sinned against you and done evil in your sighte. Peter. John, they killed him. Led him away like an innocent lamb to the slaughter. I thought I could save him but look at me, I'm the one who needs saving. I'm weak. I'm a coward, a failure. I ran. I lied. Pretended I didn't even know him to save myself. We all let him down that night. We all ran. But I'm the one who vowed I would never disown him. How can I face god's anger over what I've done? How could he ever forgive me? But he loved us, didn't he? He said so again and again. What good does that do us if he's dead? I've just come from the tomb, Jesus' tomb. The stone was rolled away! It was empty. The tomb is empty! Peter, can you believe it? He was dead and now he's alive. Risen from the dead. We can follow him again. Follow him? What kind of follower was I? I turned my back on Jesus to save myself. I didn't leave behind my selfish pride and my anger and my fears, I crumbled, I fell apart. But the angel said he would meet us in galilee Peter. He wants to see you. Why me though? Why me? I don't know why he would want to see me. I'm not good enough for him, I failed. Peter, when we were hiding in fear behind closed doors Jesus appeared to us, he said "be at peace." He's not holding our sins against us. He's forgiven them. So I don't have to be afraid to see him again. No, you don't. That's what I needed to hear. Let's go home and do some fishing while we wait for him. Peter look! It's the lord! Jesus we were on the boat fishing, didn't catch a fish all night then someone on the shore told us to throw a net on the other side of the boat. I counted it, we got 153 fish! I couldn't believe all the fish, it was hard to pull the nets in. I should have known it was you. Lord, I'm so sorry I let you down. I don't deserve to be sitting here with you. How can you accept me back after all I've done? Peter, remember the story I told you about the selfish son who demanded his inheritance, left home and wasted all of it on wild living? Of course. I acted like that son didn't I? When the son came back humbled, repented, what did the father do? Turn him away? Make him pay it all back? Punish him? No. The wayward would son found a loving and compassionate father. He embraced his son, he welcomed him home didn't he? He was full of joy. He had a feast and celebrated for his son has returned. But how could the father so happy and accept his son after all he had done? That's the whole point. This is what makes heaven rejoice, sinners who repent and turn back to them with waiting arms of their heavenly father. I am sorry Jesus. What do I have to do? God's acceptance isn't about you or about what you must do. It is always about what I have done for you. I obeyed my father's will. In your place I laid down my life to take the punishment for your sins. My blood shed on the cross washes you clean. A savior. You are the passover lamb who takes away the sins of the world. How can I ever thank you enough? Peter, do you love me? Lord, you know everything. You can search what is in my heart. You know that I love you. Then feed my sheep, now follow me. Satan knows my weaknesses, my selfish pride, my fears, my doubts. What if he tries to bring me down again? Peter, don't be afraid. You're not alone in this struggle. I will be by your side. Nothing can separate you from my love, not the troubles and dangers in life, not even demons or the powers of hell itself. I won the victory against the prince of darkness. You will have the power to overcome him but not with swords or by your own strength but by the power of my word. The message of the forgiveness of sins that you tell others will draw many people back to god, turning them from doubt to faith, from death to life. To a living hope because of my resurrection from the dead. In the end I will bring all who believe in me to my glory in heaven. I will gather people from the east and the west, from the north and the south to take their places with Abraham at the celebration feast of the way, to dwell with god forever. I will leave you to return to the glory I had before the world began. But you, go, teach others what you have seen and heard. Who will believe us? We're just ordinary men, fisherman from galilee. Go back to Jerusalem and wait. In a few days all of you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you. He will give you the words to speak and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all judea and all samaria and to the ends of the earth. Men of galilee, why are you still staring into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven. The pentecost festival is filling the streets. I can see africans, greeks, arabs, people from all over the world. You will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses. Jesus of nazareth was proved to be from god by the miracles, wonders and signs he did among you. And you, with the help of wicked men killed him by nailing him to the cross. But god raised this Jesus to life. We are witnesses of that fact and now he is exalted to the highest honor at the right hand of god. Now, repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ, the forgiveness of your sins. God's acceptance isn't about you or about what you must do, it is always about what I have done for you. Your trust in god trust also in me. Don't be afraid, you're not alone in this struggle. I will be by your side. Nothing can separate you from my love. I will prepare a place for you in my father's house and when it is the right time I will come back in my glory and take you to be with me. I have good news for you. Leave behind all these. I am the way and the truth and the life. Come, follow me.
