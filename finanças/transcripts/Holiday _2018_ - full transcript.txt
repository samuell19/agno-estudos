Yeah, and it's really addictive, you know, the rush, the physical rush of lying successfully to someone, it's really dangerous, it's really awful. And I started thinking that the whole world was like that, lying and deceitful, and I got really filled up with this feeling of hate, and then just one day, I, I just walked out of there. And I don't know exactly what happened, but I decided that, you know, whatever I would do with my life, I would never, ever be this careless with my soul. - [Michael] Your soul? - Yeah. - Your soul? - [Tomas] Yeah. - What do you mean? - [Tomas] Well, a soul. Is that hard to? Whatever. - But there's... - I sold the apartment, and I bought this boat, [speaking in foreign language] And I sailed the seas, and I know it sounds corny, I know it does, absolutely, but it worked. She gave me everything. I feel so free, and. Can I get you something warm? You're freezing. - It's fine. - You're sure? - Yes. - You want, can I take, a blanket or something? - Go get her a blanket. - Yeah, sure, why not? - Come on, be a. [water laps gently] - No, it doesn't even smell bad, so there you go. - Thank you. - There you go, that's better. - [Sascha] That's good. - So tell me, all right. - Yeah? - You were in sales, and you feel this emptiness, right? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah, it's like everything is, doesn't give meaning. And then you buy this boat. - Yeah. - Did it take away the emptiness? - Well, that's a good question. It does most of the time, I guess. - But you don't, you don't seem like this guy that is completely full. - No, and what do I look like? - A guy that gets a lot of pussy out of having a boat. - Oh, wow. [laughs] - It's a great... - Really? - Fellatio ride. - Oh, okay, okay. - I don't know, it's just, you know. - I hope he's right. - Well, well, you know he isn't right, right? - No, not really. - I'm sitting here every night with him. [laughs] - Does that mean... - And that's true? - True, absolutely. - That's true. - That means you actually get a lot of pussy. - Sorry? - Yeah. - Yeah? [birds chirp] [insects buzz] Hi, hey, Tomas, this is Michael from the other night, the grumpy old guy. Yeah, I was thinking about buying a boat, and you seem kind of the guy that knows about boats. I was just wondering if I could tempt you, if I threw a couple of really juicy steaks on the grill tonight, I hope you're not one of these fucking vegetarians. And I've got some wines, and they're not bad at all. [Sascha sighs] And he gets into his truck, and he just drives out the, the, it was the little pathway, and out comes this little dude with a big fucking gun, you know, and points at the truck. And the guy gets out of the truck, and he points the gun at him, and so, like, all right, "Do it with yourself." - What? - "Do it with yourself." [Sascha laughs] And the truck driver's like, "What, what the, what?" "Do it with yourself," you know, he's standing there with a gun, so he, you know, unzip, you know, and takes it out, and starts jerking off, you know? And it's very hard situation to jerk off to, you know, this guy's just pointing at him. And finally, he, like, he's really working on it, and then finally some, a few drops comes out, and he says, "Do it again." Fuck, no, oh, shit, you know, it's the second time, you know, and he's just, and he's red, and he's, like, sore, itching, really, and he finally squeezes a few drops out, and suddenly he goes, "Do it again." He goes, fuck. He really goes at it, and a third time, he just finally gets a little drop out. And then this beautiful woman comes out of the bushes, beautiful, with big breasts, and brawny, and beautiful. And this little guy with the gun says, "And now, you take my sister to Napule." [crickets chirp] Sometimes this works. [Sascha laughs] - I didn't get it, was that... - That was the end? That was the end? - Yeah, "Now, you take my sister to Napule." He'd just jerked off three times, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah. But I once told it to an African guy, and he was like, he was looking at me, going, "Well, give him 20 minutes, he can fuck her anyway." By the way, have you seen, have you seen this big, fucking monster boat at the end of the harbor? The one with the blue thing on it? - Yeah, the Russian one. - The Russian, okay, the Russian one, yeah. That is awesome. - You think? - That's the kind of boat I want, I want that shape, I want that size, that's exactly a boat like... - That's not ready a boat I know much about, but if it's the Russian one, you mean? - Yeah. - I heard they're making really a lot of trouble. - A lot of trouble? - Yeah. - Don't worry about that, don't worry about that, 'cause trouble is what makes the world go round, my friend, yeah, without suffering, we have no will to live. [Tomas laughs] What, ha? - Now there's a joke I like. You think so? [crickets chirp] [lighter bursts] - Wow. [laughs] [Sascha sings softly] [music slowly plays] - She's nice, isn't she? - Yeah. [background noise drowns out speaker] - You think you're gonna fuck her tonight? [slow music] - Hmm? - Well, maybe you already have. Maybe you fucked her when you did MDMA on the beach, I don't know. No, well, she says no, but. [slow music] I have a hard time believing that, you know, it is a love drug, isn't it? - I'm really sorry if there has been some sort of misunderstanding, Michael, but... - Misunderstanding? - Yes, I thought she was available, I, I didn't know. - Of course. [slow music] Available? - Yeah, well, you know what I mean. - Well, of course she is, come on. - [Tomas] Hmm? - Of course she is, it's a free world, she can do whatever the fuck she wants. I mean, look at her, she's beautiful. She's beautiful, she needs attention of men, and she grows from it. - Can I ask you a question? Why did you invite me here, you want to buy a boat, really? You want to talk about a boat? - Well. - Tell me. [slow music] - Actually, I don't know why I invited you. Maybe, you just got me in a soft moment, and I, you know, you're this, you're this good-looking guy, you know, young. And I'm, like, this fat, old rich guy on the sofa, so I was just, I don't know, I just have a lot of experience with women, you know, and I just see your innocence, it just, it just. [slow music] Maybe I just want to teach you a little, how to win a woman over. - Really? - Yeah. - So show me. [slow music] - You want me to show you? - Sure. - All right, Sascha? - Yeah? [slow music] - See this, she's all wet. You know, this little power game we're going, that's really turning you on, she's got her juices flowing, right, you want to smell? Come on, smell. [slow music] What? - No, I don't want to smell. - What? You're not interested? - No. - Good, 'cause let me just get one thing straight here, so there's no misunderstanding, you need to crawl back to that little suburban hole you came from before I hurt you. Understood? - Sure. - Good, get the fuck out of my house before I really hurt you. [slow music] [door slams] [slow music] [Michael laughs] Oh, Jesus. [Sascha laughs slowly] [Michael laughs] [Sascha cries out] [footsteps echo] [gulls chirp] - Hey. - I'm so sorry. - Yeah, so am I. What about the mark on your neck? Does he hurt you, does he abuse you? - [Sascha] No, no. - You're, you're sure? Then what the fuck is wrong with you? Is this some stupid game you guys play? - No, no. - [Tomas] No, are you sure? - Yeah, no, I... - [Tomas] Don't, don't touch... [Tomas cries out] Oh, fuck. - Are you okay? [Tomas moans] - [Tomas] Jesus, fuck. - You okay? - [Tomas] Don't touch me, what the fuck is wrong with you? Jesus. How can you let yourself be treated that way? It's fucking disgusting, go see a shrink, you fucking psycho, Jesus Christ. You and your friends are all gonna be dead or in prison in five years, really, trust me. Now get the fuck out of here, you stupid cunt. What the fuck did you expect? I was gonna sail away with you, and live happily ever after? Get the fuck out of here, stupid, stupid, stupid.
