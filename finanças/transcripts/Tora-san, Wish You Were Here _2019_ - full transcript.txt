Dedicated with love and respect to the late great Kiyoshi ATSUMI Mitsuo! It's me! Dad? Dad! Is something wrong? Are you okay? I'm fine. You scared me, making noises like that. It's morning. It was...just a dream?

I know I'm not much to look at, yet I humbly request your generous hospitality! Tora, the free-spirited fool! Created and Directed by Yoji YAMADA Dad. After school, I'll go straight to Shibamata. No need. It's only a memorial service. I'll go. I want to see Grandma. Thanks for breakfast. I'll wash up. Thanks. What were you dreaming and moaning about? The first girl I ever loved. No way. Yes way. When was that? First year of high school. She was so beautiful. She turned you down? Poor you. Why do you think that? She turned you down, so you married Mom, right? Oh. That makes sense. Now it makes sense? You're slow. See you in Shibamata. Don't be late. See you! Street peddlers have such a long history. I found all this on the web. Thanks. I'll look into publications next. Hey. Have you read Yokoi's review of your book? It was way too generous. You have more young readers because of it. That's why, I think you should hold a book signing soon. It'd be too embarrassing. I thought you'd say that. How about lunch? The chief editor asked me to invite you. Maybe you don't want to eat with him? I appreciate it, but there's a memorial service. For my wife. I'd better get going. Bye now. Come see the chief editor soon. Sampei! How's things? Waiting for someone? The priest isn't here yet. Hey, Chibo. Go get him. Gen, how are you? What's with the tie? - Now now... - Hands off! He's here, honey. Hi. - You're late. - Sorry. Mr. Kubota, good to see you. Thanks for coming. He came on the bullet train. - You must be tired. - A gift. I hear you're doing well, Mitsuo. I saw your name in the newspaper. To think he'd become a novelist... Who does he take after? I'm still a novice. Don't boast too much. Yes dear. I just went and bought your book. For you to sign. See? - "Illusory Baby." - "Illusory Lady"! My book isn't your style, Akemi. You can't even read the title! I'll just display it then! So I can brag to people. "Mitsuo Suwa was like my little brother!" Give me a break! The priest sure is late. Sakura, you told him 12:30? No mistake? I told him properly. Oh, the priest is here. Hello. Oh dear, I'm so sorry! I got the time wrong! My apologies. Please, come in. Yuri, a glass of water. I thought I was told 1:30. Please forgive me. See? You got it wrong. I did not! I definitely told him 12:30. She tends to get dates and times wrong. She's going senile. How dare you! When did I ever make a mistake? That's an awful thing to say. "Going senile"? How rude. Bad Hiroshi. Huh?! The other day... Now now, it was my mistake. My hearing's not what it was... You too, mister priest? Same here. - It's tough, growing old. - You're so right! Let's go in. - I hear insults clearly though. - Same here! Sampei, we're starting. Now then, your wife... What was her name? - Hitomi. - Of course. I shall conduct Hitomi Suwa's third memorial service on behalf of my late predecessor. My mother is my father's first Io ve. Behind this house no w is an apartment building, but there used to be a small printing plant, run by Akemi's father. My father worked there, and yearned for my mother, over the fence. His unrequited Io ve was requited thanks to my dear old uncle. What if you've got a sweetheart, but her brother will only let her marry a college grad. What would you do? Say what? I've got a sweetheart, but her brother... Dummy! I don't! Get outta here! But if you did, you'd feel the way I do. Get outta here! I'd feel the way you do? Feel my ass. Why? "Why"? You sure are dumb. You and me ain't the same person. Get this. If I eat a sweet potato, do you fart? Do ya? Damn straight. Logic doesn't make the world go 'round, got it? Got a problem with that? Dummy. That argument was only the beginning. My father confessed his Io ve to my mother, once and for all. He 's so awkward. I wonder ho w he looked when he proposed? Anyway, it's just as well his Io ve didn't stay unrequited. From my room, I can see your room. In the morning, I wake up and see you, opening your curtains, yawning, and putting away your bedding. On Sundays, you sing joyfully. On winter nights, you read books and cry. In the...three years since I came to that plant, every morning, I can't wait to see you. In fact, it's everything I've lived for, these three years... I'm leaving here now. Sakura, have a good life. Farewell. Hey! Hiroshi! What? What's up? What did Hiroshi say? Did you say something to him? Nothing much. What did he say? He said he's leaving. Torajiro! Hey! Tora! What the heck did you do to Hiroshi? Huh? Nothing, you boiled octopus! This is serious! He suddenly said he's quitting! That's what he said! Without him, we'll go bust! Swell, swell. Glad to hear it. He's too young to toil away in that dump. Tell him I admire his guts. - What?! - Torajiro! What did you do? What did you say to Hiroshi? Nothing much really. Just to give up on you. Fair enough, right? Hey... So, you came to my work... Yeah. You didn't say if you liked him, did ya? That's not fair! Boss! Hiroshi left for real! - For real?! - Let him go, let him go. How could you?! You're my brother! Hiroshi! Come on... I'm home! Torajiro... I'm going to marry Hiroshi. I made up my mind. Boss! Hiroshi is back. For real?! Okay? Torajiro, is that okay? Grandpa, your glasses case. Thanks. Okay, I'll be going. Thank you for everything. Not at all. You came so far, but we couldn't offer much. Mom! I'm hungry! Shut up! I need to eat! Munch on these! Yuri... Yeah? Say, Sakura. About our talk earlier... Please, tell Mitsuo... About what? Your father-in-law says, if...you find someone else, please remarry, and don't worry about us. I'm sure our dear departed Hitomi wants that too. Okay, got it. Maybe I shouldn't have said that... No, I'm grateful you feel that way. Alright, I'll go now. Yuri! Have a safe trip. You didn't have to reply so rudely. Mr. Kubota's concerned about your wellbeing. It's none of his business whether I remarry or not. No need to get angry. Right, Akemi? I'm worried about you too. Everybody knows you're a good father. Even so, a girl needs a mom. Listen here! My wife died on this day. This isn't the time for that! You've got no delicacy, Akemi! Oh yeah? Sorry for not having any delicacy! Oh boy, that hurt! I'm leaving! Goodbye! You were too harsh. She came to our memorial service. She was in the wrong. She's got a temper like her dad. Too bad. Hey Akemi! A s far back as I can remember, this room was always full of life, with my parents, and Great-Uncle and Auntie... Dad, when can you come tomorrow? The plant owner... I want you to take photos. And my uncle... About that. I miss his square face... I forgot about an important job tomorrow. Huh? Again? You never keep your promises. Instead, Mitsuo, your uncle said he'll go. He's been practicing for the bun-eating contest. Isn't that great? Uncle... Yes m'boy? Um, aren't you busy tomorrow? Don't worry. I've got tons of what other people don't have: free time. But it'll be boring. It's a sports day for kids. Mitsuo. I love 'em. Sports days for kids. When I see one on my travels, I stop working and watch all day. The parents' bun-eating contests? I can't help joining in myself! Plus it's my cute nephew's sports day. Right? Tomorrow morning, everybody'll see me cheering you on. Get 1st prize, or else! Got it? - You'll cheer him on? - You bet. - How? - Wanna see? Okay. For that purpose, I bought this at Shibamata Sports Goods. Hooray! Hooray! Mitsuo! Actually, I'll go. I'll get out of work. Yeah yeah! Please do! Dad, it's okay! Some kids don't have a mom or dad. - That's right. Some kids don't. - Well said. So, no one will go? You're sure, Mitsuo? - Good boy! - That was close... Okay, that's that. Hold your horses. I said I don't mind going. I'll gladly go. Quit being so uptight. It's not that. We're not being uptight. Please understand. Mitsuo. You...don't want me to go? Think about how he feels... I ain't asking you! Of course he doesn't want you to go. Hiroshi, is this how you raised your son? I rearranged my busy schedule to go to his lousy sports day. Doesn't he get that? He does. He's being considerate. Considerate my ass! Stop it, he can hear you! Let's eat! Hunger makes us irritable. Don't cry. Don't cry. It's not your fault, okay? Dad! Grandma made this for me. It's an old one of mine. I altered it. Nice, isn't it? Beautiful. Akemi said something earlier. What was that? "A girl needs a mom." Is she right? Girls need girl talk. Mothers and daughters too. Right. How about you? Ever had a guy talk with your father? No way! Not with Dad. Is that good? I mean, I had Uncle to talk to. Here. Go buy reference books or something. Okay? Thanks. Have I got more cash? Of course not. Alrighty. Uncle... Yeah? About people... People? What about 'em? What do people live for, I wonder? Boy, that's a tricky question. How can I put it? Well... In life, there are times when a man feels glad he was born. We live for them, I guess. You'll understand someday. So hang in there, okay? Oh dear. I can't remember her name. Who? You know. Your high school sweetheart. Izumi Oikawa. That's it, Izumi. I wonder what she's doing. She's in Europe? She is. Graduated college there, got married, and had kids. A great career too, I hear. She's clever, and a battler, unlike me. You've done well for yourself too. When you said you'd quit your job to become a novelist. I worried a lot about you and Yuri. I didn't say so though. Sorry about that. So how are things? Can you make a living? I don't know. It's early days yet. I've got to prove myself. Today feels strange. Why are memories flooding back... ... of her? Our train's here. Come again soon. Come stay with us if you fight with Granddad. I will. Stay and cook for us. That'd help me. Don't say that. What would Granddad do? Why not? He needs a reminder of how important Grandma is. See you. Tell everybody to stay healthy. You stay healthy too. No need to worry about my health, little sis. I'm off. See you. You closed early? To cook for my daughter. My wife's away. That's tough. Take care. Shirts and handkerchief. Thanks. Hey, is now a bad time to talk? For me, talking with you is more important than writing novels. What's up? Today in Shibamata, I heard something. All the grandparents were talking. About what? You remarrying. Don't let that bother you. People with time on their hands like idle gossip. Why don't you get married again? Now you're asking me? Because, it's not necessary. Do people marry because it's necessary? Isn't love the reason? Of course it is. You're not wrong. But you know, for argument's sake, even if there was someone, she'd be very independent, and old like me. What if she suddenly came to live in this cramped place? Not only that, you'd have to call her Mom. You know that'd never work. I wouldn't have to call her Mom. I have one already. You mean, you think I should get married again? Oh no, I should've told you first. What? Well... If you don't want to get married again because of me, and if I'm getting in the way of your happiness, I'd hate that. I want you to know. Really? That's what you've been thinking? Alright then. I'll think about it too. Good night. Yuri. Don't worry. I won't find someone so soon. Ms. Takano from your publisher? She's single, I think. I wouldn't mind her. When I was Yuri's age, I was agonizing awkwardly over my first love. Uncle... You helped me out a lot back then. "Chief Editor" Mr. Iida? Mr. Iida! Mr. Suwa's here. Hey, you. Why don't you wear a skirt for once? I want to see your pretty legs. Why don't you wear a hat? You'd look 10 years younger. Hey. That's sexual harassment. Telling me to wear a skirt is sexual harassment. I threw it back at you. For a woman, you've got no charm! That's harassment too. According to Takano, you're too shy to sign books? Get a grip! You're not a novelist unless your books sell. My writing's messy. Ms. Takano knows that. It's not messy! It's very distinctive. Lots of famous novelists were messy. Printers couldn't read their manuscripts. What's more, book signings create surprising encounters. With passionate fans. And old flames. Just do it, okay? Anyway, let's eat later. Let's eat. Gotta take a leak! Know Mr. Iida's nickname? What is it? It's his favorite phrase. He's "Mr. Let's Eat." Hey, good to see you. How's things? Oh, not bad. Let's eat sometime. Let's eat. Thank you. "Novels are like mirrors," huh? Know who said that? As if you would! Oh, it's you... She came two days ago, and she's leaving tomorrow? Tough schedule. She's a tough woman. What's next? Bangladesh. You too? No, I've got other plans. Attention customers. From 1 p.m. at the 8th floor signing area, to celebrate the launch of "Illusory Lady, " author Mitsuo Suwa will be signing copies. Thanks. Keep writing. Thank you. Wow, you're adorable! I'm a mighty big fan of yours, Mr. Suwa. I came from Osaka just for this, on the bullet train. Thank you. You'll win the Akutagawa Prize. Everybody says so! Whatever that is. Can I get a photo? I'm sorry, no photos. Oh really? A little gift for you. - Thank you. - They're yummy. Thanks. Hang in there. I'm rooting for ya! Golly gee, you sure are adorable! Hey. How many more? Just a few. Thank you. All the best. Excellent! Excuse me, could you write my name too? Sure. It's Izumi. How's it written? Like a spring. "Izumi" I didn't mean to startle you. I just spotted your poster. Izumi?! Sorry to interrupt. Mr. Suwa, you're done in 30 minutes, so why not.. It's alright. I'll be around. Don't let me stop you. Thanks. I know her. From a long time ago. Holy cow... This is so sudden... Oh no! I wrote her name! No problem. No problem. Sorry... What's my name again? Oh, Suwa. Jinbocho please. I know a nice place. Can't have a quiet chat here. You've got time? I'm free today. But aren't you busy? I'm a no-name writer. I've got enough time to sell. Don't lie! Your book signing was a big success. I'm just unusual, debuting as late as I did. Driver, it's the first signal after Jinbocho Crossing. Here. This is what I do. Hello. Is she in? Any time now. Have a seat. "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"? You work there? I'm a local hire. In the Netherlands? No. I took an interest in refugee issues in college. A close friend of mine was a refugee from Iran. I worked with her supporting refugees from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and elsewhere for an NGO, where I got to know UNHCR staff. That must have been dangerous. It was. Bulletproof vests. The ones we wore were 15 kilos. Full-face helmets too. 10 years ago, when I landed at Baghdad Airport, I was told, "Run to the terminal! Go, go!" I ran as fast as I could from the plane, with soldiers. What an incredible experience. Doesn't your family worry? I work at HQ now, so it's easier. How are your kids? All grown up? One in grade school, one in high school. Must be hard without their mom around. You have a child too, don't you? A daughter. Around your oldest's age. I hope coffee's to your liking as well. What's your wife like? She's just an...ordinary person. Don't be modest. So you're a father now, Mitsuo. Not much of a father though. Tell me! Why? Why?! Because... What? Well... Um... Say it! Tell me why! Because I love you! Say it again! Because, Izumi, I... Mitsuo! - You okay? - I can't get up! Mitsuo! He's so awkward, that boy. Will he always be? Let him be awkward. He's young. Unlike you and me. I'll go help him. Welcome. I did some shopping. Oh my, it's you, Mitsuo! Hello. Pardon me. I shouldn't say your name so casually. You're a big-time novelist now. Come on, don't be silly. What brings you here today with this lovely lady? Don't you remember? You two have met. Where? When? You know. I'm very forgetful lately. I can't even remember what I ate last night. I remember men though. This pretty girl... Wait... Are you... You're Lily, aren't you? It's me. Are you that girl, from Amami Island? Izumi? You are. You're Izumi! I am! It's so good to see you! What on earth became of you? I was sure that you and him would become a couple. A lot of things happened. I told you, remember? As I understand it, you couldn't stop Izumi from going to Europe. That's what they call "getting dumped." It was for the best. He married a wonderful woman. You have a family too? I do. That's great. Only I'm alone, huh? May I ask? Why didn't you and Tora ever get married? I was sure you would. You know. He got dumped, by her. Wrong. You've got it wrong. All wrong. You're both very mistaken. Tora and I... There were times when we lived together. In Okinawa, and on Amami. Both are tropical islands. I wonder why? Perhaps because the pace of life is different there? You know, I may as well have been his wife. Every day I cooked his meals, and washed his clothes. It was so much fun. People ask me, "Are you two a couple?" So... ...what do you say? "We haven't had a wedding yet." Putting it that way might give people the wrong idea. Oh boy... Time for bed. Tora. Yeah? I wanted to ask you. Ask me what? Have you ever lived with a woman before? Let's not dig into the past. It's complicated for us both. - I've lived with a man. - I know. - What about you? - That doesn't matter now... Why not fess up? It's like this. When I think I've got a chance, she knows I've got none. It never works out for me. You happy now, dummy? I guess it's okay to tell you now. I was proposed to once. - By Uncle?! - Why say no? - What did he say? - "I love you"? Hey. Calm down and listen. Tora never proposed to me directly. Sakura, your mother, she asked me. I think it was the day after she let me stay the night there. Just as I was getting ready to leave. Actually... This isn't serious, so don't get angry. Okay, tell me! It is serious! Tell her! Even I'm getting nervous. Well said, Tsune! Alright then. If you... ...became my brother's wife, I'd love that. I'm not serious. Really, I'm not! Please, forget it. We were only talking wishfully. I'd be happy to. If you don't mind... a woman like me. You'd be...happy to? Surely you don't mean, to marry Tora? I do. Seriously?! Oh my, Hiroshi! Auntie, did you hear?! Then, Tora came home. Sakura was so excited when she told him. And then...silly Tora... Uncle ran away without answering, didn't he? "Lily..." "You were joking, weren't you?", he asked. I was. Of course I was joking. I knew that. We both laughed it off. The end. My uncle's like that. When it matters most, he suddenly becomes timid, and indecisive. In other words, he cuts and runs. That's his weakness. You're right. He's weak. Even so, I love his weakness, to a fault. Oh no, not again. It'll be the eighth time today. Hey, I've got to go pee, but don't you leave. Stay here. Okay? Hiroshi? It's Mitsuo. He says he's with Izumi. Who's that? Izumi! Mitsuo's old sweetheart. He's with her? Isn't she in the Netherlands or Switzerland? They met by chance. He'll explain later. Can he bring her here? He can? Sure, I guess. Where are you? Kanda? It'll take about an hour. He had a sweetheart? In high school. His first love. So, she's coming... Is she pretty? Too pretty for him. Sakura, Mitsuo's no slouch, going on a date with his first love. He said they met by chance. You don't know for sure! And after he got so mad when I mentioned remarrying. "You've got no delicacy!" Sorry about that. He said he regretted it afterwards. So, is he hitting it off with Izumi? Not so fast. Izumi's got a husband. She lives in Europe. A globetrotting career woman So they're having an affair? That's tricky. My aunt had one and got taken to court. It was nasty... Akemi, I've got to make dinner. Mind going home? Oh. I'm a nuisance? She didn't say that. I've got no delicacy, huh? Sorry dear. Well, excuse me! She got mad again. She's just like her dad, the boiled octopus. - That hurt! - It's on! Hey, stop it! Hiroshi. Could you clean upstairs? What for? Izumi might stay tonight. In this old house? Actually, she might want to sleep on a futon on tatami mats. She's lived in Europe for 10 or 20 years. Go on, please? Alright. Might be a waste of time though. Air out the guest futons too. It's been a while, since a beauty stayed the night. Torajiro brought so many. A different woman each time. Excuse me... Excuse me! Gotta visit the temple. Auntie, I'm starving! Hello. Hey, a customer's here! Tora? It's me, Utako. Utako! You're here! Hello Tora! It's been so long! You're Tora, aren't you? Chiyo? Tora! Little Chiyo! Tora dear! Tora dear! Good morning! Sorry to wake you. No, I'm already wide awake! Tora, are you free today? Hey Sakura. A geisha stayed once, right? What was her name? Like a flower, I think. Did somebody say something? Tora! Botan! Thank goodness! I was worried you wouldn't be here! I'm here alright! Well well. Why'd you come? Don't play dumb! You promised to be my hubby! Oh yeah. I totally forgot! Found another girl, you heartbreaker? That reminds me. Tora killed me off once. I remember. When Utako came, right? "Hiroshi, you're dead now!" Sakura! Utako'll be here any minute! Uncle, Auntie, move it! Sakura! Sakura! What? Hey, um... - Tea. - Yeah, make some! Hey, Auntie. Cook something, on the double! Uncle! Quit gawping like an idiot! Utako's come a long way. Go upstairs and lay a futon. Got it? Hey Hiroshi. Run a bath! Make it hot! Okay. I nearly forgot. Everybody gather here. Make it quick. As I've informed you, Utako's husband died recently. So, whatever you do, don't say "husband," or "him." Or "darling," or "sir." All such words are taboo. Got it? You're a woman too... I know. Sakura, your husband's dead. Hiroshi, you're dead now! Shut up, widow! Shut your mouth! Oh crap. I'm pooped. I never saw it coming. Izumi Oikawa suddenly appeared, and is eating my mom's cooking at my family home. When I was little, we all sat together. Those moments we shared are fond memories. Boy, I'm full. Want some more? I'm stuffed. Let's tidy up and have tea. I'll help. Don't you dare! So, what happened that night? We stayed there. We were broke. Izumi, aren't you tired? Want to go? I'm fine. Izumi, would you like to stay the night? Don't spring that on her. There's bedding for you. She wouldn't be comfortable. Yes I would! Say, you'll really let me stay? Gladly! We've got a spare room. It's for Torajiro. Hiroshi even aired out the futon. Lovely! I haven't slept on tatami flooring for over 20 years. Really? That's great! Aren't you busy tomorrow? Tomorrow, I... ...have to go to see my father. You mean, in Kyushu? Actually, he's in a home in Kanagawa. He was born there. My mother says I should see him, before it's too late. He's not well? It seems so. Where is the home? On the Miura Peninsula. Arasaki, I think. It's quite remote. What should I do? I'm sure your father wants to see you. Well, I'm not so sure. You still can't forgive your father? I feel as if I should forgive him, that's all. Listen. I don't know what went down between you and your father, but if the worst happens, it won't be easy to return from Europe. It'll be too late for regrets. Go see him. You really should. I'll drive you. Arasaki, right? It'll take two hours. Mitsuo, you do that. Don't worry, he's a good driver. Thank you. Alright, I'll do it, if you insist. Good. I'll lay out your futon. I'll help. Shall we leave at 9 a.m.? Sorry. I'm sure you're busy. Not at all. Like I said, I'm a no-name writer. I've got time to sell. You're lying again. Tomorrow then. Good night. Hi there. When did you come? After lunch. I met your auntie at the store. I'll stay the night. Dad. Yeah, what? I told Mom already, but don't tell Izumi about Hitomi dying. I don't want her sympathy. You sure? I'm sure. Alright. - I'm home. - It's Dad. Is it "get" if it happened in the past? "Got"! Past tense! Hello Mitsuo. You came? Hey, I've got a listening test tomorrow. Ask me something in English. Silly. Want Ms. Takano to think I'm stupid? Where did you eat? - Understand? - Of course I do. Thanks so much. May I come in? - What's up? - You've got mail. Thanks. Well done for today's signing. No, it was all thanks to you. Actually, the reason I dropped by is to ask about your next book. Mr. Let's Eat wants an answer. Give me a little more time. Very well. How did it go, meeting your high school friend? Well, she wanted to see my mom, so we went to Shibamata for dinner. I'm exhausted. Get some rest. I'll go now. You're so kind to my daughter. It's nothing. Keep studying hard. I will. Good night. Hey. What? What's going on... ...with you and Izumi? Engaged already? Not yet. But it's in the cards, right? I'll get right to the point. You locked lips? We haven't yet! Don't get weird ideas. So, you just held hands in the dark? We haven't. What? You telling me you don't love Izumi? I can't express how I feel with a simple word like "love." That's no good. It means you don't love her. How come? If you don't act on your feelings, you don't love her. You gotta let her know. Prove that you love her. How do I do that? You know, say "I love you." Give her a hug. At the very least, you wimp. Can't even do that? You're one to talk. What about you? What about me? What about you and that sexy barber woman? I'll get right to the point. You kissed? Watch it! I'm your uncle, dammit! I ain't bragging, but I ain't laid a finger on her! Uncle, that's nothing to be proud of. You're just a wimp. Watch it! I ain't taking that from you! Hello? They're back! Sleep! Sleep! Dad, you shouldn't sleep there. Your pajamas. Sorry about last night. Why? Hard to sleep, right? Mom and Dad were overjoyed to have you as a guest, but it inconvenienced you. My parents mean well, but they're pushy and annoying. Annoying? How can you say that about them? Come on, your room reeks of mold. Listen, Mitsuo. I'm so envious of your family. More than you know. If I'd had parents like Sakura and Hiroshi, I wouldn't have left to live with my aunt in Europe. I went through a lot over there, but I couldn't go home, even if I wanted to. Sorry. You're helping me, but I'm talking down to you. Hey. You accompanied me like this once before. Tokyo Station. Take care. Thanks for everything. You were so kind to me. Goodbye. It's okay. I didn't do that consciously. My legs moved on their own, and I got on that bullet train. "What am I doing?", I thought. It was like an out-of-body experience, one I couldn't believe. I'd never done anything like that before. It freaked you out, didn't it? I was glad. You were? I felt your love, so strongly it overwhelmed me. Mom. Remember Mitsuo? Hello. It's been a while. I remember you well. You're Tora's nephew! Thanks for taking the time to bring her here. I'm surprised you made it. I didn't have a choice. You said you'd come, so I had to come see him too. I'll go park my car. Come to his room. It's 213. Can't miss it. Why were you up there? Your father's taking a bath now. Should be done soon. Your husband's in his room. Hey, I told you. We broke up years ago. He's a stranger. Sorry Mrs. Oikawa! Don't call me "Mrs."! Hello again sir. Did you make them laugh? Not one bit! Old folks are a tough crowd. Geniuses are misunderstood. Idiot. You're right though. Everyone, I'm Shiraku. Not Chirac, like the old French president. I'm bombing! Mr. Oikawa, you have visitors. Recognize her? It's Izumi. She traveled here from Europe. Europe? She lives in the Netherlands. A globetrotter. Fluent in English and French. Mr. Oikawa, your daughter lives in Europe... That's enough. Get out. If you need me, press that button. Dad, how are you feeling? He looks good today. Why's he quiet? It was awful, Izumi. He was admitted to hospital in Kyushu. He had no guarantor, so his landlord asked me. What else could I have done? I went to Kyushu. It cost me too. Lots of people helped. Said he should return to his home ground. So I found this place. You wouldn't believe what I went through. Does he even know? Say something. What?! Of all the nerve... Ma'am, no smoking in here. Sorry! Why? Dad...seemed happy. So we should forget about him. Okay, Mom? Live with me. Izumi... I don't want that woman around. I can't stand her. Alright. I'll take her with me. You don't have to go. Stay with me. I can't do that. You won't stay with me? I can't. Listen. I have a job, and a family. Two children. A husband and his mother. I can't stay here and look after you. You see? Please understand. Buy picture books or something for my grandkids. Tell them they're from Grandpa. You can...go now. Thanks. Hey, you! What's your name? My name is Mitsuo. We met once in Kyushu. When Izumi was in high school. I remember! Take good care of Izumi. I don't matter anymore. Um, Izumi and I... That girl, she can be harsh like her mother, but she's got a good heart. Be good to her. Don't cheat on her either. I beg you. A-Alright. I'm tired. Goodbye. Hey Mitsuo. Would you mind leaving me some money? Giving her that 10,000 yen note cleaned me out. Sure. Think of it as an advance funeral offering, okay? Thanks. Thanks a bunch. Hello dear. Yuri's coming. Mitsuo called. He might be late, so she'll eat dinner here. What would she like? I know. He and Yuri should stay here. I'll email them. Hey Sakura. Mitsuo and Izumi... What about them? I told Mitsuo to drive her, but I hope nothing odd happened, on the way.... Don't be silly! He's been a widower for six years now. Don't say such awful things. He'd get mad if he heard. Don't worry. He'd never cross that line. You're right. It's not fair, on Izumi either. Yes, you were being rude. This is it! - Hello. - Hi Yuri! She's here. Hey, I brought friends. They want to see Shibamata. Come in. My granddad and grandma. - Hello. - Glad to meet you! Good to see you. Kosuke? We're here! He's expecting you? Exams are over. It's our day off. Come on in. Taishakuten Temple first. A Shibamata tour! I'll prepare snacks. The heartthrob's here. This is Kosuke, my old friend. - Nice to meet you. - Hi there. Shibamata's boring. Don't insult your hometown. Let's go. See you. Get lost. My bad, Sakura. - That little brat. - Idiot. Take care. Kosuke, you look cool! Shut up! Hey rock star, nice duds. Shut up, dumpling head! You look stupid in that bowtie! Watch your mouth, dumbass! Hey Sakura. Keep this cool. It's ripe. Give some to the girls. We'll be spoiling them. Yuri, Kosuke, Yuri's two friends, Hiroshi, me. Six slices? Something wrong? When I see melons, I can't help remembering Torajiro. Smells great! It's ripe enough. My slice is small. Silly. No fighting. Dig in. Delicious! Oh no. We forgot about Tora! I left him out! It slipped my mind. What now? I don't know... - Hide it! - Where? Oh, you're back. Hey, Lily. Hi there. You stayed with Sakura? Why not stay here? I felt bad. Didn't want to impose. You're not a stranger! Her place is too cramped. I slept fine. Like I always say, this house is your home too. That's very kind. Well, never mind. Enjoying my melon? Okay, I'll have a slice. Give me one. I only took a bite of this... - Have mine. - Have mine. Eat this one. What's going on here? Why do I gotta eat your slimy spit-covered leftovers? Where's my slice? My slice! It's my fault. I forgot to cut you one. No! It was my fault. I didn't notice. Forget it! Forget it. In this house, it seems I'm easily forgotten. - We didn't say that... - But look here. Where did this melon come from? From a gent I met on my travels, who gratefully sent this melon to me. Ideally, I'd have said, "Everyone, the time is ripe. Let us partake of this delight." "Pardon us Tora, may we truly share it?" "Indeed you may." "Thank you brother-in-law." You'd all show gratitude to me as you ate it. But what's this? You didn't even ask me! "Let's eat it while he's gone!" "Melon's wasted on him. Give him eggplant instead. Let's do it!" Then I came home, and you all scrambled to hide it! I saw you. Your plate was under the table! - No, I was just... - Just what?! Please, stop it. I apologize for forgetting you. I'm sorry. Sakura. Listen up. I'm your only big brother. You think an apology makes up for forgetting me? You're that heartless? Come on, it's just a melon. You're pathetic... I'm what?! - How much was it? - What I'm saying is... Tora, if you want melon that much, buy a whole one and stuff yourself with it! You jackass! It's not about a piece of melon! It's the heartlessness of this family! You've got some goshdarn nerve! - Screw you! - Stop it! You're gonna get it! Don't! I wish I never saw that melon! Let's go, Mom. I'll get the car. What's on your mind? The day you ran away from home. I chased you to Kyushu. On a sleeper train. I'm...not a good wife or mom. I drink, and I smoke. I serve drinks, and hold customers' hands! Even so, you know, I've never ever cheated on my husband. Believe me? Of course. But despite that, he found a younger woman, and hid it from me all this time! I loved him for his sincerity, and his honesty, so I married him. He lied to me about what matters most. I've never felt so sad... I'm sorry. You don't know me. You wouldn't understand how I feel. I do. All too well. I don't know much about marriage, but I understand desperately wanting to tell someone how you feel, all too well. Thank you! You're so kind, Tora. Hey, Izumi. What do you think? About what? Your father. What if the worst happens? Will you come? I sure won't. Why would I? At the funeral, I'd be an outsider. What could I say to people? They'd just glare at me. Not that again. You know I can't come back so easily. I'm an outsider, but you're his flesh and blood. Don't pressure me. What'll you do then? It's not my problem. Ma'am, maybe this isn't the time to think about that. Think about it when it happens. I'll do what I can. Thanks. You're a good man, Mitsuo. I wish Izumi had married you. Mom, knock it off. He's got a wife and daughter. Don't be rude. Oh, really? Is your wife nice? You a happy couple? - Don't cheat on her. - Mom! Men are dogs, even the nice ones. Stop it! You're embarrassing me. Shut up! Stop the car! What for? I'll catch a train. Not here you won't. - Mom! - Leave me alone! So long! Mom! Where are you going?! Izumi, try to calm down. Let's go. Forget about her. You can't do that! - I have to! - You're not thinking straight! You're the only one who can talk her around. - But... - If my uncle was here, he'd say that. Go on. Go get her. Hey! Stop! Stop! Ow! Dammit... Mom. Mom, I got carried away. I'm sorry. I apologize, so let's go. We're always like this. I cry like a baby, and you make me feel better. But you're the one who's hurting the most! Forgive me! I hear you. Let's go. I'm sorry, sonny. Mitsuo, let's go. He's back. Alone? Good. I was worried. Hi. Long drive, right? Did you see Izumi's father? Yeah. She's at her hotel. We'll go to the airport tomorrow. You must be tired. Have some beer. I've got to drive. No you don't. I emailed you to tell you to stay. Your futon's ready. Dad! See? We'll all sleep together. Futons for four! Hey, hey! Like a school trip. Bath's ready too. Let's go to bed. Your pajamas are here. Yay! This is fun! Sleep far away from me, Dad. You snore. You still do? You haven't changed. I often fought with my dad. How does he snore? I ran away too. More than once or twice. When I did, the one who somehow found me and always took my side was my uncle. If he was here with me right no w, I'd tell him ho w sad I feel, and how much I'll miss Izumi when I say goodbye to her tomorrow. Sorry I'm late. Check-in was so crowded. So, this is it. Cheer up. Cheer up, and go back to your own life. Don't worry about your dad. You've got me. I'm glad I saw you again. Actually, I wasn't sure if I should see you or not. Why? Because, I thought I might cause trouble for you. How could you think that? We're not strangers. To be honest, I really wanted to see you again, for such a long time. So did I. I have to go. Give my best to your lovely daughter, and your darling wife. Tell them we should meet, next time I come. Izumi! I wasn't going to say this, but I will. The truth is, my wife died of an illness six years ago. Now it's just me and my daughter. Six years ago? Why didn't you say so? Well, I thought I shouldn't burden you. I'm sorry, for deceiving you. That's just like you, Mitsuo. That's why I love you. You're not mad? Hello there. Right now? I got off the train in the autumn rain. I'm walking home with an umbrella. What's up? About me writing my next book for you. I've decided to give it a go. Thank you! I'm so glad. So, what'll you write about? That's the topic you've been looking into. Sounds interesting! No, thank you for calling. I'll drop by sometime soon. For Yuri's studies too. Okay, good night. Still up? Thanks. Dad... Welcome back. Why? Well, these last three days, you've been acting like your mind's somewhere far away. Have I? Good night. I had a dream. My uncle stood by the front door. When I said, "Welcome back, " a pretty lady beside him bowed her head. I asked, "Who 's this?", and my uncle said bashfully, "She's my wife, m'boy." Mitsuo. If you ever need help, say my name into the wind, and I'll come running to you. Bye now! Know what I mean? Who are you? Tora! Don't be silly. It's true! You're the last friend... Good night. I'll try. If you don't, I'll be angry. I'm so relieved! We were rivals in school. Oh, you were that good? Go for it! 200 yen. Thank you. I thought he was scary, but... ...he 's so caring. It's so pretty. Why? I was so happy. Why do people... ...have to die? This is no place to raise kids. It's a nice place. I knew this was it. Came to pick me up? Heck no. I was taking a walk. A loser like me might get laughed at for saying this, but I believe my nephew Mitsuo did nothing wrong. He traveled far, to mend the heart of a lonely girl. Unknown to his parents, Mitsuo rode his bike all that way. I'd rather commend him for his noble act. Sorry, my mistake again. With you, I'd... I'd wear a padded coat and travel from place to place with him. Tamesaburo? Follow me! From now on... Why didn't you marry? Oh my, it is you! Long time no see! Okay, smile! Butter! You haven't changed. Especially your face. Never mind noodles, I'd rather canoodle with you! Till you're 100, I'm 99, and bugs eat us! Whaddya say?! I was born and bred in Katsushika's Shibamata, and baptized as Torajiro Kuruma at Taishakuten Temple. Tora, the free-spirited fool!
