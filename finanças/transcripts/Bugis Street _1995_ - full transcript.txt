The letter I sent you yesterday almost... became my last letter in Singapore. So many things happened in one night that I couldn't even believe it myself. But I will have the courage to face it I tell you. All the ladies in this hotel are men. Don't you think I really need the courage to face them. You'll like this place. This is my home and it will be your home too. Don't be upset I frightened you yesterday didn't I? It's alright. You know sometimes... we over do it. Don't be angry. This is for you.

Please wait Lola, Don't do anything silly! Fuck off! OK I'll go I'll never come back! Shit! Shut up! Dear Maria I tell you surprise news this time Maggie gave me a gift the other night I was so touched and it was so beautiful that I never wanted to open it. It is my first gift in my life I should treasure it always. But of course, the gifts that young master gave me doesn't count. Those are the secrets between us right? Well, I forgot to tell you. Lola's boy friend showed his body to me. It's so disgusting I think I still prefer poet to muscle man, do you agree? Sin Sin Hotel! Yes we have rooms! I've one secret to tell you girls about sex change. After my sex change the next morning... I woke up suddenly I realized my cock's gone. Oh my god, and I shout "Doctor where's my cock I want my cock back,". The doctor said "your cock's gone, gone forever!" "I have one good news to tell you." "You gonna have sex everyday for the next 6 months." "To keep your vagina hole open!" And the most boring is I had a big equipment. It's so long 7 inch. Can't throw it away, Just throw it away. And my boy friend all the time had sex! So boring. Then I discover the paradise here, right here Bugis Street I can earn a lot of money... and have sex with a lot of men. Every nigh, every night oh so good, so lovely. And then I realized, I'm still a good girl I was told by the doctor to do so. Now, I want to tell you my darkest secrets I want to be queen of the queens. To be beauty pageant queen To be a movie queen. And to get married to a prince to be a real queen. It's not easy to be a queen. You can't leave home with make up. So no one can see your ugly face. You can put a lot of jewelry. See like mine It's fake and nobody knows. Every year I join beauty contest in Bugis Street. And every year I lose I'm fed up to join beauty contest. But trust me, one day I'll be queen of Bugis Street. And I'll be queen of the queens I've always admired... Sophia Loren's big tits. So I started to save up so that I could have a pair of big tits like her I went to the doctor I ordered the biggest pair of tits they have. After I returned home my friends saw me and. They said what beautiful papayas you got there. Then they said shall we play mahjong? Alright so we started playing mahjong. We played and played & I was totally excited. Then suddenly I heard "Bam"! My breast had collapsed! And my white dress turned red I looked at it and my god! And the next day I went to the doctor to have it fixed. But this time I didn't want it big I wanted small ones. Come in! More tea ladies and gentlemen? Oh so beautiful. Come on in. Thank you. What is it? Oh this is a movie camera. Since you are in this room you know what? We are going to dress you up. And you have to tell us your deepest secrets OK. Oh so beautiful. Your new boy friend give you? Yes, now how shall we dress you up! Anyhow you like! Tell us your darkest secrets. So many I'll tell you one. In Melaka, young master. So young. So handsome. So rich. So many women. But young master's only crazy about me. Other maids got jealous. That's why I come here. Do all your dirty laundry and underwear. Oh you don't like being with us? No! I like you all You are very nice to me. But, when young master comes I'll hire all of you to be my maids. And do my dirty laundry and underwear I don't believe her story. She can go home! She's lying. Maid? No way! Ya! Lola, you tell me your deep secrets huh? My darkest secrets? I'm afraid I'd wake up one morning and my breasts would disappear. Just joking! My secrets! I hate Ming I hate him so much I'm so happy he's not around! Yes! He lies to me, he cheats me Sometimes he beats me yeah. Even goes out with other women I'm not stupid I picked him up when I was 18 in Bugis Street I was such a flower then. Everyone wanted me. You know there was this rich gentleman from Switzerland who wanted to marry me I would be living in his big house with lots of servants I'd be so grand. Not only did I give up everything for Ming I even educated him. Yeah! I taught him the finer things in life. Everything he wears I bought him I bought him jewelry, I paid his bills I paid his gambling debts I hate him! I hate him so much I'm so happy he's not around I miss him so much I forgot my sunglasses! Damn your sunglasses! Get away. . .get away. Sin Sin Hotel... Yes we have rooms... Thank you. Anybody here. May I help you. This is my passport. Don't be surprised, the sex is male... and my name is Drags. And I'd like to have a room with a view. By the day or by the hour. It's timeless. It all depends how long I will stay. And by the way these are my luggage. Do handle with care. They are from Paris. They are Louis Vuitton. You are the most well dressed receptionist I've ever seen. Especially in this kind of place. Where you come from? I come from a land that you can only dream of. What kind of men do you like? The kind of men that I like would not like someone like you. By the way this is my name card. There's a lot you can learn from me. What a queen! Sour grapes! Luggage please! Oh whenever I come back to Singapore It's the monsoon season. Today I'm going to teach you French cooking -Es-car-got! First you have to wash the Es-car-got. Make sure it's clean so you won't have tummy upsets. Listen here stop playing with food It's very rude. Next you have to grind the garlic, mix it with butler, into a rich paste. And then you shovel it into the Es-car-got. It's very Parisian. What? Very Parisian! People from Paris. And now I'm going to make mussels while you wash the Es-car-got. Tell me something about Paris Paris! Paris! Oh Paris, it is the end of dreams for people like us. There is freedom, Glamour, Spirituality, Physicality. And there is this big boulevard called Champs Elysees. And there is Arc de Triomphe It is L'etoile. The star, it shines so brightly throughout the whole of Paris. Sometimes, when I look at Bugis Street. It reminds me so much of Arc de Triomphe. Shining for people like us Over the whole of the Universe. When do you know your were like this? Like what? Beautiful? I was born beautiful! Not everybody has the opportunity to come out of their closet. Some don't. These days, it is sad people don't live life for themselves. Are you a lesbian, Lian. Be careful! Are you OK? What's the problem? I don't know! I don't know what's the problem. Why always must be me! Why am I always the unlucky one? It's so difficult to survive It's enough, it's enough I got enough already. Girls we have all been men before! We know it is so difficult to battle the women for their men. That is why I'm here to share with you my beauty secrets! Today it will be Beaute du Bust.

Girls we are all born beautiful but we need beauty aids. And the two of you You are so obscene. Pay attention if you want to be ladies! Is it very very expensive? It's never expensive to pay for beauty. But if all of you are interested I have a cheaper range. It' Beaute du Bust Two. It serves the same function But it takes a long time.

You can put my coffee on my dresser. Come and have a look. What's that? A picture frame, my mother gave me! So pretty! Isn't she lovely I used to hear people say... she is from a wealthy family. No! I used not to believe that Pictures don't lie, do they! And your father? Don't talk about him. He left us when I was six, such a wicked man he was. And my poor beautiful mother, suffered silently. She just don't tell. A lot of men came for her, many big cars, beautiful faces in suits and hats, she didn't want to go. Silly woman! She chose to suffer. But it's all for a good reason, she gave birth to me. She didn't mind me, for what I am, she said "Mother knows best". And I said. "Well thank you for you." So cute! That's me, and that's my little sister. Don't you think I'm prettier. Let me tell you my secret. When I was young I used to like to look at men. Men with muscles, like Hercules, Tarzan, Steve Reeves. Don't you like muscles? Why not? Ugly! Let me tell you of my first love. When I was 16, I fell in love. In love not with a muscle man, but with an old man. To me it was love. To him. He wasn't sure that a younger person could love an older person. He said, "Go back and think about it"! So I went back and thought about it, and I came back and I said I love you! And after 2 months, he dumped me. That much for love. And that much for older balding men. How do you know you're in love? When you in love, it's like a butterﬂy flying non-stop in your tummy I don't want a butterﬂy in my tummy! Yes you do someday! And it's not everyday you get that feeling. Today, I'll show you the paradise... of budding young creatures. See anyone you like Lian? I forgot, you're a real girl, shy and demure. Not like us, a little fake I used to play a game, a secret game. If you see a boy that you like, and make a wish, count to three. If he turns back and smiles at you. He is yours for the taking! Go on! OK! Go for it! Oh come on let's go somewhere! Have you ever been in love before, little girl? Is that a yes or no? What kind of man do you like? I used to like the romantic, poetic type. But now I think muscle man like Tarzan is OK too. You learn fast & competition. No! You know in Melaka my young master is still waiting for me. Very lucky girl! Do you like what you've see today Lian? Very interesting! Hello ladies and gentlemen! Hello beauties, more beauty tips for you? Beauty tips? Yes! What have you done to my breasts? What happened to your breasts? Are you going to cheat us. Oh I won't dare! Gimme my money back you bitch! You have to be more lady like with the girl! You think you are a lady? Go away!

He smiles at me he talks to me, he dates me! I tell you more some other time. This is just a shod note to tell you I'm in love. And to tell you from today onwards, I'm a woman But don't think anything wicked I'm still pure as a lamb You just have to take my word for it. Come on boys come on! Sisters, your friends have arrived I am going to play my favorite song. Lian, let me help you, Lola, Mrs Hwee. Mrs Hwee I am working I'll give new life to your face Rouge, mascara and luscious red lips. My face! Calm down, I'm going to give your body a new body! A new corset I've got no cloths on. Calm down!

Come on, take a photo with Snow White at Bugis Street. How much did you make, Lian, Who do you think you are? Who is she? She is my sister. Go, Lian. She is my little sister Sophie. Zsa Zsa What's happening? Lian, my dreams come true. How's your night? Very confusing. Lian! Yes. Well it's not finished yet! Go up and fix Lola's lightbulb! Not again! No more bulbs! Find one! Oh it's you! Who are you? I came to change the lightbulb. You are Lian? Oh you look different! May I help you? No! Give me that. Please! I like you in black. It's real this time. Why is it that every time I see you you are always in your underwear? Do you like it? Like it or not it's none of your business. And now, I know the rewards of make up and the price I have to pay. It gives me the courage to do the things I've never done before. Somehow, after taking off that mask I am never the same simple girl anymore. How strange it is to be mature, and how wonderful it is to experience new things. But sometimes, later at night. There are still moments when I long for the sunny breezy days in Melaka. They seem so far away now! Dear Maria I'm so happy to tell you that he remains unchanged. Enchanted, infatuated. My true love is a hope for me to lean on My guiding light, a way to survive. Ma! What happened to you? You dressed like a man! But I am a man, or I was a man! Meet my fiance Lian. This time it's a real girl! How many fiancees have you had? The kind of fiance you want to get married to, and have children! Don't tease me! After so many years, I got used to having a daughter. And now I have you back as a son! Oh I'm confused. Don't be! Sit down! Where you from? Melaka. Isn't she a doll, mummy? Yes I really like your mother I think she likes you tool... If it wasn't for her, I don't know where I'd be I've traveled so widely, done so many things. But somehow I still feel very lost I spent all my money on expensive clothing and fake jewelry. Not even had enough to stay in a decent hotel. Not that Sin Sin is bad. After all, I'm just a traveling salesman. Sales man! It's more like a sales woman! Have a look! Are you a lesbian, Drago? I visit Drago's mother many times afterwards. Sometimes with Drago, sometimes by myself. Her inner strength amazes me. To bring up a child born as a daughter but embodied as a son. What courage it takes to break all the traditional values. It takes a lifetime to fight. And now she's tired. How we gonna do it tonight I really want it rough and I want it bad Lola! Lola! You alright Lola? Talk to me, Lola talk to me! I want to die! Lola, Lola clam down! You wanna die? You wanna die! Even I don't do things like that How could you, how dare you! He'll me! No! Oh Maria Dear I don't know how to tell you this I'm so curious about life, but I'm so ignorant I want to learn I want to see things clearly. But I feel a hopeless destruction within me I want to be good I want to be free. Free from all the lies I told you Maria, forgive me I've never seen a girl as pretty as you in Singapore I bet you do really clean laundry. Will you do some for me? Sure! Then I'll take them off! Don't take them off here! Then where? Put them back on! So clean! The black magic has no effect on Ming. So Lola turns to Buddha instead. The morning before she goes to Penang, she prayed so beautifully I'm praying for true love. Do you want true love? On day you'll find it too! True love, what is true love? She doesn't want it and I don't have it! Are you leaving? Come and sit down! My mother wants you to have this. She likes you a lot. How is she? She's gone! My business here is over I'm going back to Paris. No! Oh how I miss her! I'll be alright I'll survive. You'll survive. Live goes on you know. Can I send you off? I think it's better that you stay at the hotel. What a surprise! My sweetheart I bought something for you. Thank you, this is Choi, Lian! Hello! This is Lian. Here comes the bus I have to go now I'll write to you, and you write back. Bye. Bye! That was the last time I saw Drago. She's truly remarkable. She can go anywhere with her... Louis Vuitton and find a helping hand I don't mean bad I think she has love within her. What's your name? Lee Man Kit? You must be very rich. You wear expensive clothes I love your hair. It's trendy. Look at him, he's cute. If you are jealous you should get a man. How did you come here? Came here by boat! You've eloped? Lian, young master come all the way... from Melaka to see you. Cute!

Lian, Don't forget to prepare some hot water for tomorrow. Ship's coming to town. Don't forget! Are you OK Lian. This is my boy friend Singh! Sure you're OK? More sesame oil! Nobody's here! Dear Maria. This is my last letter to you. Because I am so sad, that writing letters no longer has meaning I must admit throughout our penpalship, I created a fantasy world of my own. But now I realized the only real thing... that exists for me is the one person I detest. Even he's gone. Please forgive me again. Come let's go! That's OK. Morning, sister. My water's boiled! Your figure is fantastic I'll stitch more tight. Really? Really! Thank you! I miss him, especially his body. Please, he's gone forever! Hi Lian! Come on tell you some secrets, Lola's lover's gone. She is very sad inside. By the way if you see him, send our regards to him. We miss him very much, OK? Bye! Come in! Hi! Your water basin and the towel. Thank you. Lian what's wrong Are you out of love? Are you OK? It's love yeah! Let me tell you about love. Love is like this hotel, people come in and out all the time. Sometimes there's long term guest like me. But nothing stays forever. If your good they'll come back. It they don't come back don't worry, it's not because you're bad. Sometimes they just want to try something different. Hey baby! I brought you some durian. Darling your back I missed you. Hey Lien, come here! I want you to meet Wah Jai. He's got such a nice body yes! Could you please bring the durian to the kitchen? Thank you! I'm going to the market. Alright don't be late! Can I have a room for 3 days please. Course you may! I'll give you 103... this is our most special room here. Oh thank you. By the way where you from I'm from Bangkok. Oh welcome to Sin Sin Hotel Hope you have a good time. Dear Maria. Forget about my last letter I have to tell you finally that... I discover that life is just like our hotel. People come in and out all the time. Sometimes you come across nice clients... who treat you really well. And sometimes you have nasty ones... who mess up the rooms... and takes you hours to clean up. But ups and downs, that is what life is promising you.
