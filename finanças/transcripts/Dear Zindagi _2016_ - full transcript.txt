And this is the most important point in the world He is good looking Hardly two percent of people in the world look good... and if you have to spend your life with somebody... every morning you should at least see a handsome face Point no. 2... He has a great sense of humour... and more laughter means more sex Where are you getting this information? Point no. 3... He understands your profession If you marry a software engineer or a farmer... what will you discuss at dinner? Virus or cow dung? Hello, my husband is a software engineer And we have many interesting discussions Like what?

You are not going to believe this Being single is now a crime! What? My landlord is kicking me out of my apartment! What? I'm going to join the ranks of homeless in Mumbai And you want to know why? Did I damage the apartment? No! Did I forget to pay rent? No! The building committee just got together and decided... that only married couples and families can live there Is that even legal? This just happened? Yes he just called! I've been avoiding his calls for days Gosh Fatty, I have to vacate by the end of the month... I don't know what to do Damn these people Mumbai, India's most modern cosmopolitan city Seriously Listen, you know you can stay with me That's not the point In a way, thank God... thank God I'm leaving this city and this country for this project... But seriously what thinking No marriage means no home for women? Why don't they make this law instead 'no staying with your in-laws after marriage'? Forget it So, when is the New York shoot? I don't know I will know the exact dates in a month... when the man returns The man has not called? Raghuvendra has not called? No What 'hmm'? Why you looking so suspicious? Fatty?

I don't know... Personal and professional... always keep it separate You always say this When will you ever use this? Such strange things you buy Damn, I have to live with my parents for a month How am I going to do it? Stay with me... I'm also going to be in Goa We'll do yoga together Do yoga in your fancy holiday house... I wish my parents would buy me a villa in Goa Guess what? When I reach Goa, I have to do a beautiful shoot for my dad Uncle also joined the film business? No Jackie... he wants me to shoot a promotional video for his friend's restaurant... Who knows? This could be the turning point in my life Are you my fault Or your own mistake Shamed heart Please tell me so What do we gain now What do we lose now Shamed heart Crying is no use Oh hurting heart Oh lying heart Oh broken heart What's your problem Oh heart, just go to hell So Koko Have you met 'Salman Khan' yet? Oh my God, 'Sallu'! Is he so handsome in real life? Does he actually have a 6 pack? Or is that just how it looks on screen? Tell me Koko, I'm dying to know First of all, I haven't met your 'Sallu'... and if I ever meet him... I'm not going to tell him... 'Take off your shirt I want to see your 6 pack abs' Exactly Tell us about your ad with 'Dhoni' One second dad 'Salman Khan'? Abs? Really? Stop bugging her... talk about the main topic Yes Ashu, she should be doing a proper job... in an office... something more respectable That's when we can talk to people seriously about marriage Why will she do some other job? She's done a cinematography course in New York She is brilliant at her job and she's still young She won't be young forever... all the good boys will be taken That's my biggest worry you know... come baby... So Kaira, tell me... Are you a... Are you a Lebanese? It's not 'Lebanese', it is lesbian! Yes, are you a 'Lesbian'? Oh my God... If I were, would that stop you from talking about marriage? Even if you are, it won't make a difference... all this gay stuff is cool in the film industry You're right... from big stars to spot boys, everyone's gay... we call it 'Gollywood' now Really? Really? Of course not! Do you people even listen to yourselves? It's such rubbish The film industry doesn't have more gay people, it's just more accepting... there must be many gay people in your office too... but sadly they have to hide the fact So, are you? A 'lesbo'? No, unfortunately not So why don't you settle down? We're just worried about you Koko If you keep hanging with these filmy men... how will you find a nice boy? Filmy men are okay for checking out abs, but not okay to marry? How much junk you keep eating I've made all this for you... eat this For me? Have you ever seen me eat this? I thought you like paneer... you used to eat it... that's why I keep asking what you want... anyway, dinner is put... come baby, come... You know Koko getting married before 25... can reduce the divorce rate by 50% There is a 100% chance of not getting a divorce... ...by not getting married I'm going to stay with Jackie Koko? I'm addicted to pain Even my tears, laugh at me Why do I give myself new scars Somebody save me from myself What about the New York project... What is this question, 'did you sleep well'? If I say no what can you do? I don't care what people think... I'm not going to stay with you for other people... don't irritate me please 'Good morning' is it? Now it's a 'good morning'... If your night is not good... how will your morning be good? I think I should be a night watchman... Should I take an appointment with a doctor? Who is that? He moved here a few weeks ago, to write... Nice gUY Take an appointment with him There she is, my talented daughter... She shoots with all 'Bollywood' celebrities Really? I know this is a small job for you... but this new restaurant video is very important for us... thank you so much for doing this No, it's cool Actually we should start, the camera setup will take a while Yes, she is very professional During work, only work, nothing else Dad! Can we stop all these useless formalities? I need to get this done I only have a day Get the 24-70 Tried everything Ganju... even sleeping pills, nothing works Try 'Reiki'... my grandmother also tried it Shut up and setup Remove all this, what's all this rubbish... I am sorry, this can't be moved right now... only after this session ends What? We have to wait? Then why call us? Ma'am, the session is going on Madness! National Convention for Mental Health Awareness... it's a festival for therapists... Raunak's playground...should we go in? Shut up and sit Here? Just sit I've done a shot breakdown, you want to see? I'm sleeping Dr. Chopra, therapy, counselling, analysis... so many big terms... what do they actually mean? A proper map can be drawn after defining commonly accepted medical terms... if your problem or illness falls in those definitions... your prognosis will tell you your diagnosis It will become clear whether you need intensive therapy or counselling... whether you need an analyst or psychiatrist... it's quite simple actually It's very simple What are they talking how to understand? Dr. Pereira, how does one decide which type of doctor they should be going to? A psychiatrist or a psychologist? Each model has it's own strengths and weaknesses... an individual may find one approach more appropriate than another... depending on his personal preferences... and the depth and severity of the problem presented If I hear another minute of this... I'll go nuts This question is for Dr.Khan Dr.Khan, how do you know if someone is crazy or normal? What? Take me for example... many of you might think that I'm crazy... I've come for this formal seminar in these torn jeans... so, am I crazy? Or maybe all I need is a good stylist Crazy! Very scary word Because here we still believe that... a problem of the mind is something to be ashamed of If you have a problem with your body, that's normal... you can tell everyone... 'hey I'm in hospital... with a kidney failure... lung infection, jaundice' But if it's a problem of the mind... then the whole family goes silent... hush hush hush... as if the mind is not even a part of the body Don't laugh just yet... the joke begins now Here in Goa, my parents used to tell everyone... that I'm a gynaecologist, not a psychologist Which means the doctor's own family is ashamed... to admit that their son is a therapist, dealing with problems of the mind Imagine my plight... many of my pregnant relatives landed up at the clinic for a free check up... and you know what, I delivered a few babies too... for the extra pocket money No, I'm just kidding Dr. Jehangir Khan Thank you You'll close it please? So I'm Jehangir Khan... but you can call me 'Jug' May I have a glass of water... from that jug, Jug? I'm sure you can crack better 'yokes kaira May I call you Kaira? I have only one name So, how does this work? I have no idea how that works... you tell me Can I lie down here? Why, are you sleepy? I'm not able to sleep That's the reason I am here Did you see a doctor? Isn't that what I'm doing? You mean the white coat, stethescope, pill-giving doctors... I tried pills, they didn't work That's why I'm here Sometimes I use this to knock my patients off to sleep You're funny But, you need to work on your jokes So tell me Any major change in your life? I just moved from Mumbai to Goa... is that a major change? Yes that's a major change...and? And nothing, the moving out, the settling in... Or the leaving, the unsettling? No, that's not a problem for me... I like to move, not being in one place... in fact I love to travel... it's just this sleeping problem So why did you move from Mumbai to Goa? You know... I came to Goa to be with my best friend... she's having issues with this guy... who she really likes, really 'liked'... and she thought he liked her too... but then he suddenly got engaged to someone else So your best friend, is she okay now? I don't think so... I don't think she is okay I think her main problem is her profession She got this dream job, which is linked to him... his new fiancé will also be on this project So how will she handle that? I don't know What if everything gets messed up? I don't know what to advise her... should she just deal with it? It is her dream job after all Sometimes I feel I should tell her - 'Grit your teeth and just do it... you won't get another opportunity like this' And sometimes I feel I should say - 'Shut up! And say no!... don't you have self respect?' So I don't know what to tell her So you are not able to sleep, because you are up all night... wondering whether to tell your best friend to shut up or not? My grandfather used to tell me a story... please narrate it to your best friend My grandfather was a mountain-climber Before any expedition, he would be thoroughly prepared Sadly, poor Pyarelalji was not like this Who Pyarelalji? A very old friend of my grandfathers' He was also a mountain-climbing enthusiast... whose life-long desire was to climb the toughest peak... Mt. Everest! Finally one day, Pyarelalji got the chance to climb Mt. Everest... with a Chinese trekking expedition group Without thought or preparation, he said yes and left But the group was Chinese... so they could speak only in their own language... no English Vinglish So the trek began As they slowly and steadily climbed higher... Pyarelalji paced ahead of the group with much enthusiasm... while the Chinese people kept waving from behind and shouting in Chinese... 'Don't go ahead! hatahau hatahau!'... but Pyarelalji thought they were cheering him on... and saying 'go ahead, You can speak Chinese? Can you? No Then this works Don't laugh, listen Suddenly, Pyarelalji saw a growling snow leopard in front of him... Pyarelal got scre*** I mean he got bloody scared Now he started waving his hands frantically and shouting 'Help, Help!' But the Chinese people thought he is just happy So he kept crying for help, and they kept waving back Then? Then the snow leopard ate up poor Pyarelalji What? Yes he was hungry You don't find many people on Mt. Everest... And the group kept shouting... 'don't go ahead' What a strange stow No, it's not a strange story Please tell your friend... that sometimes we choose the tough path only because... we feel that to achieve important things... we have to take the tough path We feel we need to punish ourselves... but why? Why not choose the easy way out? What is so bad about it? Especially when we are unprepared for the tough path Why climb mountains when you are not ready to? Excuse me You will tell your friend the story right? It's important Okay, I think... My sleeping problem began... when Raghuvendra got engaged Raghuvendra? The guy in my story? Right, your friend's... No, mine At least I thought he was mine We used to work together Jack! What are you doing here? What are you doing here? You don't answer my calls, you moved here without telling me Without telling you Why would I tell you? Who are you? Actually I have one thing to tell you... I've made my decision What decision? Kaira, I have to talk to you... Just shut up, one second Listen to this story This man wants to climb Mt. Everest... but without any preparation he leaves for Mt. Everest... with Chinese companions... and as he's about to fall... the Chinese people don't understand... obviously, because they are Chinese... and they keep waving their flag... and the man is stuck... and then a tiger eats him up! Got it? The difficult option is not the only option We can choose the easy option also because the easy option is easy You know, forget it It's too much for your small mind It's a very deep thought Are you talking about working on the film? I was talking about NOT working on the film! That's my decision Okay, okay good Good? Yes I think that's the best... You think? Did you hear that? You think? I have already taken the decision to not work on your film... What do you mean by 'you think'? I guess someone really does need therapy... You told him? No Koko Him? Yes, she told me, so? And anyway why do you need therapy? What's the big tragedy in your life? You didn't want to get serious, didn't want to commit So I don't understand, what is the problem? You don't understand? - No! Then get out Oh God Kaira... You really need to grow up Good thing you've decided not to work on my film... I'm looking for mature people to work with What did I just say? Get out right? Get out! Bye, see you Jackie I'm not mature enough to handle your big fat project... but mature enough to sleep with you? Amazing! What a revelation Kaira I came here to... I don't want to do this, get out What are you doing Kaira? Just get out! Koko, are you sure about this? I know with all these personal issues... working with Raghu will be tough... but this was your big break Okay Jack Sometimes we choose a tough path just because... we believe that to achieve important things... we have to choose the tough option But sometimes you need to choose the easier option... because at that time that is the best option for you Right? Especially when you are not ready to face that tough path Damn! Wish I had said it right when he was here You want some tea? Tonight I'm going to sleep so well, so well... Very well! I was at this construction site... with all these construction workers... all short and strange people Suddenly, I lose my balance... and I go falling down... this big fall... and land in muck I think it was a gutter All these workers are just staring, but no one is helping... I look up... and I see my camera dangling... and then suddenly out of nowhere... this group of newly married women... in saris, pallus & bindis all land up there... and they start pointing at me, laughing at me Bam! I woke up It was 4 am... I went straight to the bathroom and stood under the shower Why shower? I don't know I felt dirty, I felt like I needed to clean up So this Raghuvendra, he is tall and handsome? That's your conclusion of my dream? Just asking You know what I felt... I felt I am ugly, trashy, cheap, dirty That's funny What's funny? I mean... all this from a girl who is the opposite of ugly, trashy or dirty That's funny... not "ha-ha" funny okay OOPs! What's with this? It only creaks when you really like someone, but can't do anything about it Yes, Raghuvendra is tall and handsome So you like tall people, not short and strange Maybe...Sid was also tall So there's a Sid too? Yes so? So I mean you're a young and beautiful woman... you will have admirers What do you mean? What do you mean by admirers? I mean you're a young and beautiful woman... you will have admirers Admirers? - Yes You're trying to say that there are lots of men! That's what you're trying to say No, what do you want me to say? Why would I say that? No That's what you are saying You actually mean that I'm a fast girl, a cheap girl... - No come on! Fast dirty cheap... ...why use these words? Isn't that what the world thinks? If a girl has more than one relationship then that's it! Kaira... have you ever bought a chair? What? A chair, kursi have you ever bought one? Yes And did you just go into a shop and buy the first chair you saw? No Exactly my point We look at so many different chairs until we find the right one Some chairs may be comfortable but look like shit... others look nice but are hard on the butt... So the process starts, chair after chair... how many chairs we check out before we find... that one chair! It doesn't creak with me If we look for so many options just to buy a chair... then shouldn't we look at options... when choosing a life partner? So...dirty cheap fast...no Smart clear fine...actually superfine! Wait wait wait So the women in my dream who believe that... marriage is the only acceptable relationship... I felt dirty because of them See? You figured it out yourself... you don't need anyone's help But the dangling camera? What does that mean? Just like my future, it's hanging in the air Maybe you should sit on my chair... and I should sit here from today It's so cool I wish the whole world could hear about your chair theory Why is it important for the whole world to hear this? No I just... if they understand this chair theory they will stop judging others... and what a beautiful world it will be No Kaira... when you understand yourself well... then what others think of you doesn't matter If you don't take charge of your own life somebody else will I pity those who don't shop for chairs Kaira, will you go back to your chair please? Looked like you wanted to take my chair home with you And speaking of home, I have homework for you Homework? Yes I'm very strict with my homework assignments okay I want you to chat with your mom and dad What! 10 minutes with each please Please, what will I say to them? Time's up, see you next week What! We have 20 seconds more Hey you saw that? What happened? 20 seconds happened I don't like this buzzer Homework Kaira Hey, those are really nice looking glasses... Thanks You're going to see Jug?

Despite the mess, Goa is the most beautiful place in India I wish I could agree Why? You don't like Goa? I was born here This is where my parents live, how can I like it? Did your homework? Only half... I managed to talk to dad for 5 minutes... okay 4 minutes, but that's a record in itself And your mom? I tried, but she was busy So you've only done a quarter What did you chat with your dad? About Kiddo, my brother... he's studying at the London University... he's coming home soon, so my parents are hosting a big party... for his homecoming When I got here nobody even said 'welcome' So you don't like Kiddo? No no I love Kiddo, I really do He's the only one who can make me smile... just by being there When he was little, I would read him his favorite comic... you know Tinkle, have you read it? Yes Hunter Shambhu, Kaalia the Crow & Supandi... So Supandi! was Kiddo's favourite... So I would replace Supandi's with Kiddo's name... and read it to him He loved hearing the story in my voice Even today, he says it's his best childhood memory And your best childhood memory? Come on, there must be something... I don't know What are your favourite childhood memories? My dad used to bring me here every Sunday... To play Kabaddi with the sea Kabaddi with the sea? Kabaddi kabaddi Go back! Just two more okay I can do this all daylong It's important that parents create happy memories for their children Now I am a parent myself So I'm hoping... my son has at least some happy memories... to tell his therapist He stays with his mom In divorce cases kids usually end up with the mother I just regret not being able to spend enough time with him I remember Shaira... my doll My dad's birthday gift to me When I used to live with my grandparents, Shaira was with me I never played with her, just kept her close to me At night, I would hug her tightly and sleep You were shy?

Who Shaira? My doll! The one dad gave me How come you thought of that doll all of a sudden? Do you know where she is or not? She may be in the storeroom... along with your and Kiddo's old things What do you mean by maybe? She must be there somewhere How will I remember after all these years? Do you remember anything at all about those years? Taste this Bibik What is Bibik now? Bebinca! Kiddo's favourite No I'm leaving I'm making coconut laddoos for you... your favourite... see I remembered You just want to make me fat! Coconut laddoos! I feel like breaking a coconut on someone's head No, no violence, do deep breathing What memories will parents leave behind? When they can't remember anything themselves? Let's drink to Shaira, wherever she is In my street The moon that appears That brings Eid with it Is that you? My mom Has made me a suit Has shown me a dream Is it of you? My heart is destroying itself for someone Who is it? It's you My heart is protecting itself for someone Who is it?

Yes They are the best nights Hey, great song bro... "you mum 'm.! Did I? Killed who? We're all alive here Girls night, don't mind, cheers What a voice you have, you should be singing in films Why only films? There are all kinds of music... there is rock, pop, jazz, blues... do you like blues? Blues? You seem more red to me... What? Vorresti fuggire con me? That was Greek to me... It's Italian actually Does that mean that I'm so deadly and gorgeous... that you can't take your eyes off me? Not at all It means that I'm heading to a private beach with some of my friends... to play some music Would you like to run away with me? Not bad Somebody seems to be in a musical mood today "My heart is destroying itself for someone, who is it? It's you" Excuse me? "Last night I went out to listen to a band" "Which band was it, where did you go where did you go?" "The name of the band I don't know I don't know...but singer I know" So tell me more... tell me more...tell me more We didn't talk, only music What to tell? So what was his name? Banjo? Or the fellow was called Cello? Rumi - Wow! My new kursi, my new chair So, comfortable? What? New chair, comfortable? Yes but it's a musical chair... twenty four hours will have to listen to music... how to listen? Why don't you tell him straight, that you like dialogue too How can you tell a musician to stop the music and talk? He'll think I'm a musical idiot... have you ever felt like an idiot? I've sat through a three hour Italian Opera... pretended it touched my heart... when every minute was torture I wanted to stand up on the chair and scream even louder than them... I'm an opera idiot! Wow, okay What would you do if you were dating an opera singer? I would say, 'Darling, I will do anything for you... but don't make me hear the opera' Then end of story right? She would dump you and run Or after 6 months of suffering, I would run away If one is going to suffer, the other person should at least know What is the point of suffering in silence? See when... I'm so sorry - It's okay I will get a new one for you I'll do it, don't touch it... I think it's safer to have our sessions outdoor Go on, Rumi I like people who smell nice I hate smelly people Really? Why? So you like smelly people? Everyone has a different smell... that's how people get attracted to each other Eeks! Who goes around smelling people to get attracted? Dogs Dogs Ya dogs! Ganju, we should record our conversations... they're true genius sometimes Genius! Yes please "Genius is not one who has all the answers... genius is one who has the patience to find every answer" Deep Which genius said this? Dr. Jehangir Khan Khan...khh So does he smell nice? Who? There you go Wait let it breathe...cheers Listen to this bit I love chocolate Okay this bit Wait one second Pink Floyd's first album, you have to get this "I agree, you're the most beautiful of all" "I agree, you find a place in every heart" You like strawberries? "Yes you are a dream your every move is a charm..." "but, you're not one to be wooed by praise" Try some? Can we just have the music off please! I'm sorry, I just need some silence Everything okay? I wrote this song for you But it's okay, silence is good sometimes... there is beauty in silence too... let's be silent That's not silent I'm sorry Okay play your song No forget my song... let's talk about you I want to know everything about you Come, sit Tell me about you What was your first film about? When did you decide to be a camerawoman? What's your journey? You know, I haven't even shot a selfie in my life Isn't that funny? So tell me... I want to know about your dreams, your inspirations, your aspirations... I want to know everything about you Huh? What's going on? Shall I put on some music? Please I've heard enough for a lifetime So still suffering silently? Or did you say it? I yelled it So he ran away? No, he was very sweet actually He stopped playing the song, which he had composed for me... and began asking about me I felt guilty at first but... Why are romantic relationships so irritating? With friends, it's all so easy, it just flows... you don't need to make such an effort Who are the 5 people closest to you? Your top 5? Why? There is an important study... based on the size of the human brain... that shows that everyone has about 150 people in their whole universe The next cut is the 50 who you would invite home for dinner... then 15 who you turn to in times of need for comfort... and the final cut is of 5 people who are your whole world... your inner circle Who are your 5? Fatty, Kiddo, Jackie, Alka... Raghuvendra, no And I forgot to add... these 5 people can also change with time That's true but these 4 people will always be on the list Okay, so think of these 4 and tell me How do you feel when you are with them... as compared to the changing 5th? How, how do these 4 people make you feel? Special, I feel special I feel... important, I feel respected... I feel happy and safe So you don't feel safe with your boyfriends? No... I feel safe but... I don't know it's not that With my friends... I feel free, I feel like myself Why safe? When you start liking a guy... What is your fear Kaira? It's back in one piece I believe broken things can be put back together How is the 'Brain Doctor' going? Is he married or single? Didi... Hi Alka! Look there Didi... how are you? Rubbish Why did you go to the doctor? Are you okay? I went to a 'Brain Doctor' What happened to your brain? Nothing, if you have an emotional problem in your life... a 'Brain Doctor' can help you solve it Do such doctors exist? Then everyone should go to them Yes everyone should I agree, you're the most beautiful of all I agree, you find a place in every heart Yes, you're a dream, your every move a charm But, you're not one to be wooed by praise... Don't stop! Come on, play the music Heart...be silent Don't beat so loud Let her not see you suffer You will smile now at my state But, you're not one to be wooed by praise Should I whisper in your ears Or scream from mountain tops It was good fun We danced to Honey Singh songs all night What's happening? Fatty! I called you, why didn't you answer? Hi Koks Why are you both grinning like that? Jackie is just telling me about her new boyfriend What? Hello? What new boyfriend? How about telling me... I'm right here, am I invisible? You didn't even ask Why do I have to ask? Okay guys relax How can you not tell me? I know why, because it's that weird guy at the bar right? See this is what you do You're always judging my men I'm not judging, you called him weird yourself That was then, now I like him But you didn't tell me that you like him Because you never asked, you're not around How am I supposed to know if you don't tell me? You keep doing this and blame me for everything I am around! Fatty where are you? Great you also leave me Good morning! Good morning Jackie Chan Anything special today? Yes You You're so special Okay, I'm special So you fix cycles too? L try And if I can't fix them, I recycle them Recycle a cycle? Kaira, you have to crack better jokes please So all that cycle art in your room and... HEY, hi by the way! This boy was wearing those funky looking glasses, you made all that? Finally! You noticed He's an artist If you can't fix people do you recycle them too? Bye Jug Sorry about it That's so mean Yeah that's so mean, let's go Why Cycle today? Just breaking the pattern Yes, should break it You must be going insane listening to crazy people like me... all day inside one room Quite possible Albert Einstein once said... "An insane person is one who does the same thing over and over again... and expects different results each time" By the way, Rumi, it's over... Why? Can't do it... it's too much He doesn't fit in my... I don't know... I can't handle it it's too much What's too much? Too much Wait wait, Lance Armstrong Did Rumi do something wrong? No we were just wrong for each other... Not this chair Shiver! Only happens when we feel cold... or have a fever, or due to weather... or sometimes people shiver when they are scared... I just want to be free... free from all this I also want you to be free... free from your fears Free! Oh wow Help me Damn, our time's up What? Got to go! Sorry Jug! Get my glasses please MY darling boy, all good? Yes all good Kiddo! Spend some time with me now, not fair...

Yes you I have no clue but I want to see the fun Sweet boy Kiddo And you, is your best friend Jackie here? Is she still single or... Yes, she's still very much single and so is Kaira Please stop, it's starting to hurt kaira, come I want to introduce you to a young man This is my niece, Kaira Hi Kaira, Suresh Suresh Pleasure Well I'll see you'll later then Alright, cheers Cheers So you're a photographer right? Cinematographer actually One and the same thing No, it's not the same thing It's not? - No okay What do you do? I'm a techie... does that sound boring? Fun It's fun, then cheers So, why should I be interested in you? That was pretty direct right? I can be interesting if I meet an interesting girl... it depends okay See Kiddo, your favourite food Thank you What a sweet child Kiddo was, never used to cry Never left my side, always 'Mama Mama' Well I figured 'Mama Mama'... was a better way to get what I wanted than to cry How fast these kids grow up I know Look at Kiddo, he has achieved so much at a young age He has got a scholarship for a higher degree... then an internship with a big firm... tell them the name of the company, Kiddo Dad, just stop it now You will definitely be successful You are doing the correct thing You're not eating anything... are you dieting again? I don't feel like Eat something Fine, give it to me Here have this You remember Chanda, Kiddo was such a gentle, quiet boy... but Kaira, a real firecracker... she's still the same Firecracker yes, you're absolutely right... anger, tantrums and sulking, most of all with me You kids have no idea how tough it is to be a parent... and it's never ending Once a parent always a parent I agree No holiday from this job, right Ashu? All parents should be awarded a President's Award Huh? I love the food So end it then Just end it What? The job of being a parent, just end it You keep going on and on about how 'tough' it is, so just end it Who has forced you to continue being parents? Has anyone forced you to? You didn't start the job well in the first place so why continue it... just put an end to it! When kids need you the most you happily leave them and go and then complain about their tantrums... 'Oh how angry she gets, makes faces' It was your idea to bring us into the world... you treated us the way you wanted... and then you blame us for how we behave... and you say it's 'tough'... What do you mean by 'tough'? Tough my foot! How could you just abandon me? How could you just do that? How could you just do that? How could you both leave me and go? And the only reason you took me back was because I failed the 2nd grade... yes, I failed the 2nd grade! Shame Shame! Dumb Kaira failed the second grade! Such an embarrassment for you... that you left everything and came back to India? And when I was finally happy living with my grandparents, you dragged me away from there too You separated me even from them Yes President's Award just for that! And I have a firecracking news for you! Actually a bomb! Are you ready? I have begun therapy! Yes! I am seeing a 'Brain Doctor' So feel free to call me crazy, mad Please say it to me right now say it to my face Say it! I'm crazy! 'Kukoooo' 'Kaira's gone mad!' That's what you think... that people like me are crazy She is a bit emotional right now... she is also out of work Dad, she has enough work She has chosen not to work right now Kiddo, go get her Don't worry Make her understand that... once your parents moved back, she never failed in school again... so they took the right decision There are all kinds of failures... and I am looking at a few right now You Okay? I don't know Were you happy as a child? I only remember being happy once you came home See this Where did you find that? I was looking for something from my past... and found something from ours instead You know... As children, when we are sad, our elders tell us not to cry When we are angry, they tell us 'give us a smile' You know why? Just to keep the peace at home When we wanted to hate they didn't allow us... so now when we want to love... we suddenly find our whole emotional system is topsy-turvy... it cannot function Sadness, anger, hate... we were not allowed to express anything... so now, how do we express love? It's okay to be angry sometimes, even with parents... It's good, it's healthy... it's okay Kaira... They left me at my grandparents' house Mom told me this was like a vacation, that I would join them soon Dad's export business in Goa had failed... so he went to Africa, Middle East looking for business opportunities... mom went with him In the beginning I was happy staying with my grandparents... in their big old house in Vasco I would write a letter to mom and dad every week... sometimes even twice a week At that age, 'writing' meant drawing some pictures... trying to write some big words... but every letter ended with the same question... 'When will you come back?' I was 5 years old... every week I would drop my letters in the mailbox with my grandad... then I would wait for a letter wait for an answer to my question... but it never came When they called once a month, they had some excuse each time... something about 'an address change, no post office close by, feeling unwell' etc etc but I still kept writing And my grandad would keep walking me to the mailbox... he always said that I will get my answer some day soon Then, a year later mom visited me in Goa... with my new baby brother, Kiddo I was jealous Because he got to be with mom all the time, and not me then mom said that I would be away from them for 'just a little longer' so I was still fine with it... I remember asking my mom if she got my last letter she said that it was so beautiful that she put it up on the refridgerator... so that she could see it every day I was so haPPY--- I ran to my room so I could write another letter for her... so I could see her get happy in front of my own eyes A scene I had imagined in my head many times So I took out my colours and paints... drew a picture and ran to show it to her As I was about to enter the room I heard my grandad shouting at my mom... he was telling her that what she was doing was not right... how could she not respond to my question, to my letters... and then, I heard my mom reply... "I can't give her false hope... the truth is that we can't take her back just yet... not until the business is set up... It is too tough to handle two children... and travel constantly blah blah But everything just seemed to... fade away... It was a strange feeling... like someone had grabbed the TV remote from me... and changed the channel from something I loved to something horrid... and then threw out the remote I went back to my room, tore up the letter... I was 6... took a decision as a 6 year old... that I had nothing more to say to them, nothing more to ask... I didn't write a letter ever again in my entire life Never My poor grandad kept trying to get me to write... but I knew I had nothing to say to my parents... or to anyone else... I just became quiet I shut down Then a year later my mom said that they were coming back for good... dad's friend had a business partnership for him in Goa itself In all these years, dad couldn't set up his business abroad So imagine, all this for nothing So they came back But that year was the most stressful for me... I didn't want to be with them I wanted to stay with my grandparents They were separating me from them too I threw tantrums... cried a lot, troubled everyone To top it all, I failed the 2nd grade... and that, not my 100 letters... not the fact that I was their daughter living away from them But my failure made them take me away from my grandparents... and back with them finally I'm sorry I'm sorry If you don't cry wholeheartedly, how will you laugh wholeheartedly? It's okay... I'm not much for rules... but because of the rules... I can't pop a champagne bottle to celebrate this moment... but we can do the next best thing To letters, Kaira Cheers! Go easy... To feel safe, first the fears have to go The fear of being abandoned, of being left alone... You have carried this fear with you all your life... this burden is falling on all your relationships, especially on your love life So you leave others before they can leave you You want to say bye before they can say bye Because you never want to face that pain again So, kaira Why not say bye to this fear once and for all? Why not say hi to life once again? I am not saying that you should forgive your parents... or even to stop being angry... you do as you wish But I will say this... try to look at them not in the exalted status of parents... but just as two regular people... who make mistakes, like everyone else As a child it is hard to understand all this... but now, as an adult... you can at least try Don't let the past blackmail your present to ruin a beautiful future When something touches your heart Say hi to it... When your heart is not in it Say bye to it... Let it come, let it come Let it come into your heart Say hi to happiness Let it go, let it go Let it go from your heart Say bye bye to unhappiness... Love you life Love you life Love me life Koko, I'm sorry I'm sorry Hello? Hi Ma'am, I am calling from eBay, are you happy with our services? Yes why? Please do continue shopping with us Thank you Sometimes hold my hand, and walk with me Sometimes leave my hand, and let me go free I'm a little moody You're a little crazy What a pair we are Let it come, let it come Let it come into your heart Say hi to happiness... Let it go, let it go Let it go from your heart Say bye bye to unhappiness... Love you life Love me life You are different... you listen to me, you really listen I wish I had someone like you in my life... Am I making sense? Not at all, but that will be 3000 rupees please Where were you? Just disappeared I have to give proper notice if I miss a session... and you left me with one small note 'Sorry'... that's not fair I know, life is unfair Fine Hide all your secrets You know... my issues with my parents may get sorted... but with men! I am never going to find anyone Tell me something Is there such a thing as a perfect relationship? Like just one special relationship? Kaira I think... why just that one special relationship? I think one can have many relationships in life... different relationships for different experiences... like a musical relationship... someone who shares our interest in music... or the lets-get-coffee-together relationship... perfect to have coffee with... but not anything else... Special gossip relationship... with whom you can have the perfect gossip Or the special intellectual relationship... for all those perfect bookish discussions... So many different, special relationships... The romantic relationship is just one of many To expect a single relationship to take on the burden of every need... a bit unfair, right? Never thought of it this way I'm glad the camera is back Me too Jug, do you want to get a cup of coffee or something? No, our time's up You won't bunk the next session right? It is the last week of our sessions... how can I miss that? So, done sulking with Goa? No more sulking What about your work? Actually I got an offer What? A production company is interested in funding my short film... so I am thinking, why not stay back here and shoot it Since it's the final class, have I passed? This isn't school, to pass or fail I wish there were teachers like you in school I'm no teacher Okay not teacher but... you know what I mean We are all our own teachers in the school of life Okay, that got a bit heavy Life is like a jigsaw puzzle People like me can help you find the missing pieces... and put them back together... but, only you can complete the puzzle So now that this is over... can we meet outside of this... just as friends or something? No this is not possible Kaira And what if I tell you... that I like you... In fact... Go on, I'm listening In fact I really like you That's it, said it I really like you too I really like you I respect your feelings... but my job here is done for now As unconventional and friendly as my methods may be... lam still your therapist... any other 'friendship' would be outside the realm of my own professional ethics The closeness that you may feel to me, your 'BD'... is very normal This happens, it's common So I'm common? No, you are not common You are different, special... you are unique You know Kaira People feel all sorts of strong emotions in here... anger, hate, love I shouldn't have said anything No, you should have It's really good you said what you said You expressed your difficult feelings... in a straightforward and mature manner... rather than letting them fester... inside of you... and we don't want that... No This Kaira, is huge progress Okay but, tell me one thing How can this be the last session? No no... No more stories? So many new problems I will have... Yes there will be many problems... but now you know how to solve them But I'll need help I need you Kaira... when you see a pattern emerging in life... a habit, then it's time to think about it Genius is about knowing when to stop Okay then Baby Fatima, can't believe it This is your godmother, Kokomaa Battle after battle Corporal Balthazar fought in the Portuguese army for 14 years Nobody knew that Corporal Balthazar was not Balthazar... but Dona Maria, a woman... disguised as a man This was the only way for a woman to safeguard her life and dignity For 14 years Dona Maria fought two battles... one on the battlefield, and the other with herself... with her fears Finally, one clay on the battlefield, her true identity was revealed As fate would have it... in front of Captain Aphonso... Captain Aphonso... Commander of the fort and a doctor... not only saved Dona Maria's life... and nursed her wounds... but made her fears disappear... and freed her from the ghost of Corporal Balthazar For the first time... Dona Maria had the courage to face her true self Finally she felt free, she felt alive With her newfound courage, Dona Maria soon became Commander... the first woman Commander of the Portuguese army... Now, Donna Maria fought only one battle... the one on the battlefield Speech! Speech! No speech, just shut up! It was beautiful my darling So proud of you Beautiful film Really? Very impressed People who make music with the camera don't need musicians I wrote a song for you, want to listen? Just kidding I'm proud of you You gave Kaira her first break right? Yes She could not have done this without you Actually if I was with her, she couldn't have done this Cheers! To the longest project of this century! Cheers to my baby Hi! Hi! I was wondering... Yes please tell me, what were you wondering? Would you be able to live as a man for a few years? Huh? It's a really interesting concept, your story How did you come up with the idea? What's your story? Do you make films too? No, I make furniture... tables, sofas, chairs Chairs? Like Kursi chairs? Chairs like Kursi Kursi like chairs Dear life, I know we haven't been in touch for a while... So nothing Just wanted to say hi Kabaddi kabaddi...
