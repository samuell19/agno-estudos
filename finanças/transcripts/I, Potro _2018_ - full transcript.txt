Are you recording already? Film me from the side. I want my Greek profile to show. Here we are, in the Pumas' general manager's office. It's the time when we get our bonus. They throw cash in your face. When we get out, we're buying a Ferrari. In Fury Red. -Potro. How are you? -How's it going? -You can't record. Pati, who let them in? -Hey, it was me. We're making a Potro Romani documentary. -That's great. -Look at him. He's so sweet. We've almost sold it to ESPN. We have to discuss some private issues now. I have nothing to hide from my Potrelievers. I promised them access to my life. You're part of my life. -Well, if that's what you want. -Come on, man. Get me that money, 'cause I can't wait to go party. Get me that cash. You're off the team. It's like he'd been practicing! This is gonna be a great blooper. You're the best. Can you wait outside? I need to chat with the president. We'll go get that Ferrari and fill it with girls and champagne soon. It's fine, man. It's just a misunderstanding. Just relax. I have a year-long contract. Don't make me have to sue you. This has been, by far, the worst investment in the history of Pumas. I was great in every match. Stop busting my balls. Yeah. You left behind some pools of blood, also. Give me a letter of recommendation. I have to play soccer. No, Potro. That's entirely unsportsmanlike. I've notified all the league's technical directors about your situation. I'm Potro Romani, the Argentinean stallion. What do you mean? You were shot in the leg. No fucking way! Think you're president of the world? -Don't make me call security. -I'll kick their asses. It's gonna hurt those midgets when they fall down. Especially you. You have an army of midgets. What's your deal with midgets? I don't get it. And I don't care. If you hate midgets, that's your deal. But you're out! -Do something else. Take pictures. -Suck my balls, son of a thousand whores! So, I don't get a bonus? Give me half and I'll give you a cut, we'll close the deal. No, you fucker. -I'll lock you up for 10 years. -You're locking me up? -I can't give you a bonus. -15 percent. -I can't give you a bonus. -Give me some money. Pati, can you give Potro his papers, please? -Good luck-- -Fuck you. -Potro. -Yeah, baby. I had an appointment with you to look at that Ferrari. But I liked the McLaren better. I'm sorry. You know I'm on your side. CLUB DE CUERVOS PRESENTS Son of a bitch! Motherfucker! Son of a bitch! Guys, we're canceling everything. Send it all to hell. -There we go. -This is great, Potro! -Great, you son of a bitch? -It's great, narratively speaking. That fucker just kicked me off the club. Are you an idiot? We can show people what the abyss looks like in soccer. What do people care about the bad stuff? They want to see women, parties. I'm penniless, asshole. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL Think about the money, Potro. What's money got to do with it? This is going to strengthen your brand. Imagine a product line of sport deodorants. Aqua di Potro. How's my makeup? -You sure this is gonna work? -Of course. Don't make me look stupid. Do a shot of me going out, Fast and Furious style. What's life without soccer? A bunch of rotting bodies walking through the field, like zombies. Soccer was everything to me. I feel raped. Penetrated. I'm nothing without soccer. What am I? An accountant with no calculator. A chef with no tongue. Darling! Hey, hey, baby! -What are you doing? -What are you doing, baby? You're still doing this thing? We're working on a marketing promotion to strengthen the Potro brand. Stop busting my balls. I had a hard day. Forgive me, baby, okay? Forgive me. -I was kicked out. -What? I was kicked out of the club. We already knew this could happen. -What do you mean? -Of course. You were waiting for this to happen. No. We can finally work on setting up that Brazilian wax place we've always dreamed about-- That's not what I want to do. How many times do I have to tell you? That's your dream, not mine. I don't want any waxing. -I mean it. -No, you never trusted me. -That's the problem. -What are you saying? -Are you for real? -Relax. No, I'm not going to relax! If you're doing this we might as well tell everyone who supports this family with oral, double scissoring, huh? Extreme anal thrice a day, all so this guy can live like a king. Just look at him. Eat shit! All of you! Eat shit! Go get fucked by a bus full of Somalis. It's what I do. I'm a porn actress! -Like you didn't know. -Great. Now what? I'm tired of you! Fucking asshole! Yuli... Cut, cut, cut. The fleeting career of Argentinean forward Potro Romani has come to a tragic end after being discovered covering up a bullet wound. Romani had his debut with the Cuervos, leading them to a final. He's married to the controversial adult entertainer, Yuli... What are you doing? Can you...? Can you get out of my fucking way? You're blocking the TV. ...drugs, and tax evasion... Don't you see what you're doing? You're telling me I can't play soccer. I was kicked off the team! My wife left me! Now they cut off my Internet. They won't even give me two months! My brother's getting married. My little brother's getting married! Fabricio Romani's your brother? Of course he's my brother. Where do you think all this talent came from? This is printed in our genes with God's semen, man. Right here. Milk in my veins. Listen. Hey, it's Fabri. If this is about work, talk to my manager. If you're from Barça, leave a message. I'll get back to you. Chimichurri! You're getting married! I didn't get my invitation! It's probably this shitty postal service. I never get anything. Congratulations, man! Call me, call me. I need you, please call. We're going to Argentina. You're coming with me, along with all these fuckers. Really? We'll be there as a family. You get that? Even if you've never left this city? You know what the girls there are like? The scenery? It's fucking beautiful, man. I might even stay at my dad's place for a while. Waiting for all this to pass. Over there, people like me a lot. They coddle me. Look at this. Comfort before anything else. Look at the suit I bought! Wine colored. In Argentina we call this Bordeaux . Bordeaux . More French. We're more like Europeans. Not like you fuckers. Bunch of Indians. Look. Argentinean passport and Mexican passport. I have two nationalities. Guess which one's worth shit? We're ready, man. We're going to Argentina! I really like to travel. They say it stops the aging process because we're moving at a high speed. You see how it accelerates. We're going 620 miles, maybe 1240? But it stops it because people below are on a different speed. You get me? This whole relativity thing. They also say that flying too often can make one of your testicles retract. I have a friend whose testicles retracted. You have to splash cold water, put ice on your balls. Your asshole clenches. It's terrible. I'm gonna go jack off in the bathroom. Wait. Welcome to Santiago de Chile's Airport. I've been called by the Argentina National Team more than once. They wanted me to cut my hair. No way I'll do it. My brother's a hell of a player. We're equals. We're both good. He's really dedicated to soccer. He spends a lot of time, energy. I like other things. I like to enjoy life, you get me? A GOAL ON THE WIND This is about a soccer player, a striker, who's traumatized because he can't score anymore, and the ghost of a trainer helps him overcome the trauma. The guy gets to be a striker again. My old man wrote it. Dario Romani. The Shakespeare of Argentinean soccer novels. Look, man, goose bumps. It's been five years since I was here. Of course I'm really excited, fucker. We're arriving now! My mentor's picking me up, the great Pitín Belarri. This guy discovered Messi. The soccer mafia took all the credit. What's up, Riquitiki? Little Potro! -How's it going, you fucker? -Good, good. Let's go. I can't stay at the airport too long. Why? What's wrong? Nothing... I have this debt with the government and I can't travel, but it's fine. It's all good. What's with the camera? That camera. I'm making a documentary of my life. For ESPN. Is your Lamborghini in the shop? What do you mean? I lost everything to my wife. The car, I lost the house. I lost most of my dignity, my license as a coach. Everything. So, kids, don't bet using credit cards. And stay away from opioids. BUENOS AIRES (DOWNTOWN) Sorry about the mess. The maid comes tomorrow. -You have a bit of everything. -Yeah. You know what? The only thing that bitch couldn't take from me was those missiles I discovered myself. -I still got it. -Oh, yeah? -I signed for a two year contract. -Great. Goya! Goya! Cachun cachun, ra ra! Cachun cachun, ra ra! Counting the boys here, there's... -three of us, but if you want to come... -Are you inviting me to Romani's wedding? That's such an honor. No, wait. I have an AA meeting, -but I can reschedule it. -Wait, fucker, wait. -Same thing. I can go another day. -You been drinking a lot? No, no. Listen. Check back there. I think I have a tuxedo or something. What's this, man? -Did you have kids or something? -No, no, no. They're adult diapers. What? You think I'm gonna shit outside at 4 in the morning in winter? My asshole clenches. It's great that you're in Argentina. Best country in the world! We have the cutest girls. We have Maradona! The Pope! Heaven and Hell, man! Do you know how many fans I have over here? People see him, they go nuts. I can't walk down the street. Hey, hey, look. -What? -Check out who's in here. What are you doing? -Who's this? -Potro. What Potro? That singer? Potro Romani. Don't you like soccer? No, man, I have no fucking clue. No one knows this guy. Just keep going. Come on. -We'll record another one. -Okay. Where's the place? Where are they getting married? I don't know. I can't find my invitation. You lost the invitation? Fucker. Wait, got it. It's at the Yatch Club in Nordelta. Well, well, well. The Romani sure are chic. I went there once but they didn't let me in. But with that tux, we're good. Is that tuxedo any good? Don't make us look bad. No, no, with a green cummerbund and bowtie... You'll love it. Get out of this shitty car. It looks like... This is vintage. It's 25 years old. It's like wearing torn jeans. Son of a bitch. You really farted in there. What do you expect? I've been here all day. -Stop. -What are you doing? -Don't touch me. -Busboys come in around back. -Busboys? -People working here have-- -Do you know who I am, kid? -No, I don't. -A busboy who thinks himself a manager? -I'm gonna break his face. -He's the striker for the UNAM Pumas. -What the fuck are the UNAM Pumas? The best team in Mexico. Don't you have a TV at home? Listen, third world Beckham, I'd have more respect for you if-- I'm gonna kill you! I'll bash your face in! -If I kick you, you'll regret it. -Guys. -Hey, what's up? -Hey. I'm good. -You here for the event? -Yeah. Are you... friends with the bride? No. My boyfriend's the best man. -What's all this? -It's a documentary of my life. Of your life. Why? I'm famous. Potro Romani. So, you're famous, huh? That's great. You want a picture? No. Shall we go in? We going in together? -I'll take you. -All right. -Go ahead, go in. -Thank you. ...and the father. And he remembered that autumn when the dictator came into power. A sudden kickback... That's my dad. Listen. ...beckoned to him. And he took the shot. Finally, he scored a goal. This is a fragment from my book, A Goal in the Wind , of course. You can buy it in stores. More importantly, I wish to dedicate it to my great creation. My son, Fabricio. -A national treasure. -Thank you very much. My family! Come on, man! Come on! It's Potro! What's up, my family? What's up, darling? My mom looks so beautiful! What's up, boy? How are you? You're getting married! Stop. Calm down. Is this man bothering you? -Who are you? -I'm the best man. You? -Don't shove me. -All right, stop. Look at you, you're so pretty! Give us a spin! You got lucky, Julián. Listen... What are these cameras? I'm working on a documentary for ESPN on my life. We made one for Fox Sports, right? We'll exchange footage later. Mine was for the world. Sandro, can ESPN film this? We'll come to an agreement and send you protocols. -Can we or can't we? -Listen. Come on. -I'm hungry. Where are we going? -There's food here. Come on. Leave the cameras. Stay here. -Leave the cameras. -I haven't been here in years. -Come here. -What's up? You're getting married! -Stop! -Come on, I love it! -Stop it! Stop. -What's wrong with you? -Aren't you happy to see me? -You're not invited. Stop that. What do you mean? You want an explanation? Come on, man. Stop kidding around. It's a very small ceremony. Did you know about this? Tell him the truth. You're a disaster. We didn't want your bad luck. -Don't talk to him that way! -It's true! Stop defending him, Mom! We didn't want negativity in his life. It's true. He better listen. I can't believe it. I bring bad luck? I made you, fucker! I taught you how to play soccer, man. Oh, really? Christmas, five years ago. No, no! -Stop. Let him talk. -Christmas, five years ago. I won the Ballon d'Or. I was so happy. We come over for Christmas. It just happens to disappear. -I told you it wasn't me! -Then what was it? What do I know? The maid. A lot of stuff disappeared. Come on. Who is that man? What do you mean? He's Fabri's brother. What do you mean? He never told me he even had a brother. Potro Romani. -I never liked this family. -Stop that already! Stop! They're not Catholic, Renata. They're not true believers! I'm getting married! We discussed it. All I wanted was to come here and enjoy this moment with you. I'm proud of you. I admire you, brother. -Let's go, it's late. -I'm sorry. Forgive me. You think I don't want you -here in my wedding? -Then what is it? Get your shit together! Take charge! Get your life together! -Oh, honey. -Did you know about this? I wasn't allowed to say anything. I argued months with your father. I wasn't fucking him. -You know how we love to fuck. -I love to fuck, too, Mom. I love to fuck, too. Was that the punishment? -Yes. -You get mad and you stop touching me? -You think that's fair? -Yes. I came all the way from Mexico. Tell him something. Do something. -Go fuck in the bathroom. Convince him. -She won't. I've masturbated enough. Come on. -Come on. -I love you, baby. Two years dating and you never mentioned a brother? This might not be the best time to talk. No, it's the best time to discuss this. I'm about to marry a liar. What's next? Will you come out of the closet during our honeymoon? Right, of course. Will you tell me you have kids when I get pregnant? -Calm down. -You want me to calm down? Yes. Then go find your brother or I'm not getting married. No. -No. It won't work. -This won't work. I'll go find him. I won't be responsible for his actions. Shake on it? Potro, don't get mad. It's over. Maybe the old man is right and I bring bad luck to the family. I'm not an idiot, you know? I used to be a mess, but I've grown up! I'm 35 now. I'm a grownup. Now that I'm here, he doesn't want me there with the family. He probably convinced Fabricio to not invite me. Are events in Guatemala that short, or did they not let you in? -You want a fight? -What's up? -Stop, stop. Everything all right? -I'm gonna break your face! I got it, okay? I'm not welcome here. That's fine. But I care about you. -Have a nice life. -Potro. Stay. Come on. You came all this way already. You don't have to beg, Julián! That's okay, I better stay. Let's go in. I'm thirsty. -Wait, wait. -Let's have a drink. Can you take a step back? Let's set ground rules. Further back. You can't take any alcohol. No drugs. You can't go near or talk to my father-in-law. -You can't start a fight. -Can we take a selfie? This isn't the time, but okay. I'm not in the picture. Tag me. RealPotroRomano. And never, I'm begging you, never show your penis. I can't promise anything. -Please promise me this. -Let's go drink! -Promise me! -Let's get some tequila! Promise me! We're inside now. This is a miracle for me. I live in my car. Imagine what it means for me to have running water. It's amazing. Potro started out in little league. He had promising abilities. Fabricio immediately said, "I want to play, too." His father convinced him to go train at a little league school from Italia's Juventus. What does he do? He stops paying Potro entirely. He puts all his hopes on Fabricio because he saw more potential. Potro lost his mind. First he accuses the father with the police of having raped him. Then he breaks his car with a crowbar. A nice car, too. Then, when delirious, he set fire to the house. KID SETS PARENTS' HOUSE ON FIRE A big mess. From there, he was taken to juvie. When he got out, he wanted to go back home, but he'd been kicked out. A real tragedy. Awful. Hey, man. You discovered Potro, right? Yeah, yeah, it's true. Sometime later, I found him playing on the street in a dry pasture. All you could see was a cloud of dust and kids playing. I'd see how much Potro would stand out. He was like a magnet. I couldn't stop watching him play. He was different. I couldn't really place him on any of the clubs around here because they'd read about him on the news. But I had a friend who trained the core force of Mexico's Cuervos. I sent him there and you know the story. He raised himself up. No one gave Potro anything for free. That's called having balls. Big balls. Hello, guys. I'd like to introduce Diego. He's going to be one of the best men. Just like we said. Please be friendly. Bye, Mom. See you downstairs. -You're not getting it right. -No, it's like this. -Step aside, I got it. -Calm down. -I know how to do it. -Just calm down. Hey, keep him away, all right? Keep him far away. -Don't let him come close. -Fine. Stay calm. We'll tame him and keep him calm all night. Like in the field. I don't want anyone close. It's hard to get it right. I almost got it. It's the tenth time you've tried it. Look at all you sour balls. He's getting married. You're gonna have a great party. This guy was a big playboy. Now the fucker's getting married! -He got married. We lost him. -Yeah, well... In Mexico, we'd be snorting so much coke, it would look like a crosswalk. We'd be diving in with a stick and all. No, no. No drugs at all. I want you to take it easy. -You're not getting it. -Yeah, it's like this. He's doing a great job. What are you saying? Take that camera away. I don't want it here. Hey, listen here. On the wedding night, you better fuck her right. The goal after that is the most important part, all right? She might not look it, but believers love to be fucked up the ass. -No, she likes it. -Go away, go away. She better be in pain and not be able to walk tomorrow. I... Listen to me. Listen to me, man. You may be seated. Just as the sun rises every morning in God's skies, the wife's virtuous beauty shines on us all. -What a ceremony, huh, man? -Move it, man. The Earth is filled with God's benevolence, Stop crying. I can't. This is a wonderful moment. It's my wedding. Only I'm allowed to cry. Do you vow to remain together in sickness and in health, till death do you part? Tag me in the pictures. Everyone's taking pics. Upload it to Instagram. Tag me. You have a million followers. I don't have that many. -Do me a solid. -After the ceremony. The wedding bands, please. -Yes, I vow. -Yes, I vow. With this ring, I vow to accompany and love you for the rest of my days. I love you, Tigre. You're the best goal I ever scored. For us Brazilians, that Chilean was just stupendous. So great. The second best goal I ever scored. Tell him about the best match you ever played. Did you get the metaphor? Stand back. Sorry. I'm sorry. -A goal? -And now, I declare you pro and wife. You may kiss the bride. They're gonna use tongue. Watch that hand, man. Thank you. Bravo! Now let's send them off with a wave! A wave! For their marriage. Come on. All right, boys. That's good. Now that the boring part's over, we can go drink. Give the gift money to my dad. Afterwards, you drink, do drugs and forget. Don't be cheapskates and give it now. Can you shut your mouth, please? Now it's time to have fun and drink, fuck yes! Come on! Come on! Auntie! Aunt Rita, you're so pretty! What's that? Botox? And new tits! You look lovely. Welcome, everyone. I've noticed us Argentineans talk with our hands a lot. We kiss. Man to man. Doesn't mean we're fags. Let me tell you. You look Mexican, you son of a bitch. -What's up? You good? -How are you? You back? We're looking at a few clubs. -That sort of stuff. -I have a business proposal. I'm working on a protein shake. I want you to be my ambassador. -Your image. -We'll talk. -Fine. -You okay with that? Who's this? Grandpa! It's Potri. How are you? Did Grandpa get Alzheimer's? Fucking hell. What a shitty disease. He doesn't have Alzheimer's. I think you don't know him. Beauty. Everything's great. This is our spot. I'm the brother. -You're screwed. -My glass goes here. -The seats are numbered. -It's not a good night to fight. -No, of course. -Sit here, come on. -Why fight over the seat? -This asshole's driving me crazy. Asshole, my balls. Thank you very much. He's a friend of your brother's. You have to treat the best friend right. -You got that? -Listen to me. -Tell me otherwise. -The night is so long, and we have to get along. This is a party. Hello! This one's a little thin, huh? But thank you! Thank you for the gift. -You don't know what happened in Mexico. -Enjoy yourself. And do me a favor. Tell your friend's girlfriend to get dressed. She's naked. -No, Dad. -Renata's parents are Opus Dei. Have respect. She's right there. They've been married for over 20 years. This is your table. -No, I-- -No, no, come here. -I should be with family. -Come here. This is your family. Look after them. Is that clear? -I'd have to take a cab to get there. -We have taxis. Now, sit down. This is the best table. It's right next to the kitchen. We'll be the first to eat. Stop kidding yourself. This is the replacement's table. Waiter! Listen. Come here. Bring me one tequila for the gentleman, one for the lady, and, I don't know, a strawberry daiquiri. -For the kids. -One problem. We have no tequila. We have wine, champagne, whiskey, Fernet, Campari. What do you mean there's no tequila? Are you for real? There's no tequila. Go buy all the tequila you can. -Do you have any Rivotril for me? -Sure. I have enough to knock out a zoo. Let's kill some neurons! Hey, wait! Here they come! Come on, let's hear it! Ole, ole! Fabri! Reni! Ole, ole! Look at that! That's beautiful. Who do you think taught that move to that guy? Man! Who wants it? There we go! It's on me, okay? Come on. Time to have fun. I'm sick of your dad. Renata's father paid for the party. Now that we're here, there's nothing to drink. You know what dad's like. What were you expecting? Yeah, well... Good thing this duo is together again. Here we are! Potro Romani and Belén Romani. Potro throws a long pass. Belén gets the ball! She avoids the goalie. Go! Goal from Belén Romani! I have to tell you something. -You have no idea-- -Is it drug dealers? Stop watching drug dealer shows. Yeah, then they'll come looking for us. -With machine guns-- -Have you been taking your meds? No. Your dad doesn't like it when I go to the therapist. The meds were expensive. You know I'll give you money if you just ask. -I'll send it to you. -Family waltz. Now. Come on, come on. Well, cheers, boys. If you feel like dancing, why not take her? -Is that okay? -Sure. -That'll be two thousand. -Two thousand? Well then. I don't have Argentinean pesos, only Mexican ones. -It's better priced against the dollar. -Whatever. Come on, let's go. People are so sour here. In Mexico, even whores are happy. Potro. Hey, man. Do you have anything to cover her up? A coat, maybe? A dress? Anything? -What's your deal? -It's making us uncomfortable. Have more respect for the lady. The best hugs, the best advice, comes from a whore. Then have her give you a hug in the bathroom. Fabricio! Fabricio! Fabricio! I love you. You're-- I admire you! You're the greatest-- -All right, stop. -Come on! He's not armed. He came to take a picture. -Yeah, I'm not armed. -Stop, stop. Potro, calm down. -It's all right. -Come with me. Slowly, slowly. -Calm down. Stop. -You're such a big deal. It's an honor. -Can someone take my picture? -Potro, take our picture. -Once I almost... -He's so nervous, poor thing. I almost got killed... -Look at the camera. -...trying to see Messi. -Your picture's done. -One more? -Take one with me. -No, thanks. What do you mean? Take one with me. Hey, slow down, slow down. Come on, then. -Are you my fan, too? -Here it goes. -Here goes. Upload it to Instagram, huh? -Right. It's done. Good. Are you taking selfies? -Thank you. -Fuck. Oh, God, thank you. Get him out of here. It's all for you. I keep telling my dealer to give me an invoice for my coke. He refuses. Sugar has to go up in smoke. I don't like weddings. I like to do something more... symbolic. Something you remember forever. Potro. -Everything's ready. We good? -That's great. Focus on me now. Come on. No! You're kidding! A flash mob! -How'd you remember? -No, that wasn't me. Look at the show this fucker's got going. Hey! What happened? I was having a good time. Tristan prepared a beautiful speech. Are you kidding? No, he worked several months on it. Tristan? Thank you. A flash mob is one of my favorite things in the world. -You liked that? -Yes! Thank you all! I'd like to make a toast. For our friendship. To me, Fabricio is really... much more than my best friend. He's like a brother. More than a brother, because you can get a loser for a brother. He's so important. What we have is enormous. We're shoulder to shoulder in every battlefield. Do you remember when we went to the American Cup? -I remember. -We played against Mexico. We've never had an easier win. -Five goals. -They're all like foosball players. This asshole always makes me look like the bad guy. Like having the national team play against a retirement home. No, no, no. Don't make a scene. Please, I beg you. -Don't go. -Pitín, let go of me. -Sit down. -You sit down or I knock you down. -Calm down. -Let your brother speak. -This isn't on me. -When we were young, my dad would take us to the bleachers to watch the Rosario Central team. -That was the way to watch soccer. -That's it! Soccer was ours. It's what brought us together. It was our code. And now you're making a fool of yourself. A round of applause for my dad. -Thank you very much. -The author Darío Romani. Thank you. Thank you, really. Look at how much he loves you. I loved you, too. Until one day... One day you shit on my dream. You left me with nothing to give my brother everything. Look at me. You know how much it hurts to have your dad not believe in you? To have a brother who never stood up for you? This belonged to all three of us. I was left out. Was that it? Are you all done now? Did you get it off your chest? -Can we keep the party going? -You can rest easy, old man. Because I was shot in the leg with a .45. -I won't play soccer anymore. -It was drug dealers! No, Mom. It was Tony. A friend from the Cuervos. But that's it. I've forgiven him. This is for you, Dad. For screwing up my life. He always does this to be the center of attention. How old are you? Why didn't you tell me? -Why bother? -Because I'm your father. That's why. You never cared about me. What are you saying? Why wouldn't I care? We have to look to the future. Do you have any idea just how much you can do? -Like what? -What do you mean? Stop crying. Have you looked in the mirror? Do you know what you look like? You're pitiful. You're healthy, not counting the wound. You know what you were like as a kid? You were phenomenal! -But what-- -Fuck off. It was just an idea. Don't take it like that. Both of us have made mistakes. Now we must look to the future. Start anew. It's over! You know how many times I tried to get closer? To you? Yeah. Why don't you stay here for a while? With Mom and me? -You think so? -Come here. Come here, you fool. Come here. Do you have any idea what we can do together? We can go see a match. We can go fishing. We'll go get sushi. I'll tell my secretary to write a contract. -Drink champagne, dance, have fun! -Contract for what? What for? You give me the rights for my new book! Your whole life is extraordinary. What an irony. "Lead goal." "Lead Goal" in gray. A red cover. It'll be a hit. A forward gets shot playing in a dangerous third world team. -It'll be a hit-- -Why don't you just go fuck yourself? -What do you mean? -You haven't changed at all. -I understand why I left. -Diego... You're a terrible writer. -You have no skill. -What? You only published your book because Fabricio paid for it. You're a failure. I won't hit you because you're my father. Go on, go away. Get closer, so we can see the tears. Come on, man, go away. Don't be so morbid. I'm tired of the documentary. Leave. Here he is, fucking hell. Come on. Where were you? What are you doing? Why'd you leave? Why'd you end up here? I should've been there for you. What happened to you was terrible. So suddenly. I didn't know about your situation. -I didn't want to disappoint you. -How could you? Are you nuts? What happened to you is fucked up. The end of soccer is harsh, but when it happens abruptly... -I have nightmares every night, man. -Of course you do. You're going to have to learn how to play the hardest game of them all. You have to learn to let go. It'll be hard. Difficult. To have to step away from the spotlight... It sucks. You can't deal with that. This wasn't your fault. What does one know about the shitty plans God has for us? But it's done! Keep moving forward. You're young. Come on, huh? Give me that bazooka. You're smoking bazooka? That shit kills you. -You're giving him this shit? -Yeah. -How can you smoke that, Ricky? -Here. Take a hit. Come on. I just wanted to see my family. My dad never loved me. My brother's a pampered asshole. He thinks he's Messi. At least your mom loves you. She doesn't love me. My mom's crazy. She's showing signs of schizophrenia. I'm an orphan. You're no orphan. But sometimes blood ties are worth shit. Because family is the people you choose to be with. I don't know what to do if I stay. I feel like a foreigner. This isn't my house. What's a house got to do with this? Home is an abstract concept. Theoretically, I live in my car. That's my house. Home is the place where one feels welcome. Yeah, look at this. Look at the plans I have in Mexico. Party in Xochimilco with hot ladies. Thong party at her place. Look at the girls. Look at the ass on that one. A Tulum retreat with Chava Iglesias. These are my friends. Not these shitty people. We're here now. Send everything to hell. Ex-wives, toxic people. -Fuck my dad. -Yeah. You are my dad. You're my dad. And my brothers? They're these fucking Indians. Let's go have fun. Let's have fun! Since we're here, give me some more. Let's change the music. People are falling asleep. Play this. Come on. Come on, you fuckers! Let's get down to business! Hey, stop that, stop. Come on, stop it. Kiss her! Come on! Long live the bride and groom! I can't believe I'm seeing my folks like this. I don't know if I've ever seen them touch. I swear. That's the power of reggaeton. -That wasn't me. -Thank you. I never thought my wedding would be so amazing. Touch him. He's like a rock. I'm telling you. Your son would be a great stripper. All right, all right. Put the hose away, okay? Come on. -Aren't you dancing? -I'm tired. Come with me. -I'm good here. -I want ecstasy. -Come on. -I don't want to. You go. Go have fun. -What's it like? It's nice? -It's nice. -Do you know it? -I don't. -You have to come visit. -Just tell me when. Whenever you like. -You're on Potro now. -Yeah? You like it when I hit you? What are you doing? -It's exactly what you're seeing. -No, no. -Why don't you ever listen? -Let go of him! Let go of him! -You're a brute! -Hey! You're a shithead! Potro, I'm going to kill you! -What? I'll kill you. -Stop! This is fucked up. Get him! You idiot! The chick was looking for me. It's not my fault. Come on, Potro! -Stop, you faggots! -Stop! Come on, man, make him bleed! Potro, come on! I promised Fabri I wouldn't fight. Can you calm down? Look at what he's doing. See? He made me look like an idiot. Stop it. What are you saying? You fuck all your fans. I want to have a good time, too. We had a special bond. That wasn't just sex. -Stop it, you cock with legs. -What about the song? -What bond? What song? -Hey! No, no, no, you--! Hey! -What are you doing? -That was an accident. You okay? Look, man. Calm down. -Renata. -What's the matter? This is your fault! -Stop. -What did you do? -Stop, stop, stop. -Darío, what did you do? You're not the real Potro. You're a disaster. Don't you get tired of fucking everything up? -Over and over. -Why are you scolding him? Stop it, Dad! It wasn't me. This asshole wants to hit me. Why does he want to hit you? No, no, what are you doing here? Get the fuck out of here! -I come in peace. -Get out! -Get out of here. No. Go. -Give me a chance. -Get out. -Let me clean your dress. Give me a moment. I'm an expert on blood stains. Give me a second. It'll come out with this. It's all the same. Everything you do is all in vain! This is all driving me crazy! I fucked up, Reni. -I'm sorry! -You and your brother! He didn't do anything. You didn't fuck up that bad. He didn't do shit. It was me. I shouldn't have aired our dirty laundry about my dad. I knew deep down I wasn't invited. What could I do? I couldn't not come. It's good you did. He's your brother. -I have to speak to Fabricio. -Wait! Yes! Because he's a liar. He kept you a secret. It's a shame we didn't meet before! He's a great guy! If I want to start a family with him, I want something clean, not full of shit. But don't fight now! Especially not over me. -We're very different, you know? -Yeah. I did shitty things to him. Once I exchanged our urine samples. I was on Maradona's diet. -What's that? -Well... This one. I snorted it every four hours. My piss came out sparkling. -Really? -He got suspended for a year. Because of me. But despite all that, here you are. That says a lot of good about you. And that's it. -It came out! -It came out! You do everything right! You fool. It's so good to meet you and that you came. You know what? I love that you're here. I love that you fucked Tristan's girlfriend. Maybe that'll help deflate that fucker's ego. Dick face. -Thank you. -Thank you. I'm gonna kill your brother. Stop that. Calm down. You're not hitting my brother. -He fucked my girl! -You hit my wife. That was an accident. -He fucked my girl at your wedding! -Learn to look after her! Ask her what happened. You're not touching anyone. All right, that's it. Hey, hey. It's done. Please forgive me. I forgive you. What do I have to forgive you for? I love you. My home isn't here. My home is in Mexico. My family's waiting. With chilaquiles and a party. It's all good. You're all invited to my place. There, in Aztec land. Where people are welcoming. And nicer. And women are more open about anal. I love you all. Potro, wait. I'm sorry the soccer thing didn't work out. I watched all your matches. -Stop fucking around. -I didn't miss a single one! Look. Cuervos v. Santos. Cuervos are losing 2-1. Three minutes before the match ends, Potro gets the ball. My brother. The goalie is not in position. He noticed. He crouches, places the ball, stands... No hesitation. Bam! The ball touches the net, and the goalie has to get it. -You watched it. -Yes. All of it. Apparently I'm not the only pro in the family. You won't ever catch up to me. But you know what to do with a ball. -Come visit me, okay? -I love you, bro. -Hey, Potro. -What? -Follow me on Instagram. -All right. Tag me on this. I'm glad you joined in the fight! They were kicking my ass. Throwing you around like a ping pong ball. If I didn't show, they'd have kicked your head into your ass. Stop fucking around. I have to look after you. -It's true. -Don't you want to stay home? -There's space in the car. -In your house? You're kidding. Come with me. Do you know what sort of partying we get to back home? We have whores, drugs. We fill the place up with girls. I don't know how I'd live with so much pollution. Don't you have to wear a mask? What's your plan? I spent all my money on this trip. I can start from scratch. I can work as an aide. A waiter at the hip neighborhood maybe. Thanks, man. Thank you. I discovered you. I'll keep looking after you until I die. -Do me a favor. -What? Stop smoking crack. Get a job. And get out of that house. Find an apartment. When I start working, I'll send you money. Okay? I'll send you some. Listen to me. See you soon, all right? -I love you. -I love you, too. Come on, you Indian. We'll be late. -What's up, blondie? -Hello. Where are you traveling? -Mexico. -Your passport, please. Yeah. Here. -You don't look Mexican. -I think you're a little racist. Listen. I'd like to renounce my Argentinean nationality. Please hand that to the government. This passport has already been canceled. Keep it. You might need it. Then throw it away. -What are you doing? -What's the matter with you? That's like betraying your country. You don't know Mexico. -Have you ever been? -I'm going there now. I'm Mexican. In fact, listen to this. I'll go live in Cancún. When I die, I want my friends to mix my ashes with coke and snort it at the beach while playing a Potro corrido. -There. -You like that? I loved it. You know why? Because I start a new life today. Be careful with hot peppers, mariachis... -and the little plazas. -Be careful with that menopause. It's close, if you don't have it already. Where the fuck do we come from? Where the hell are we going? Let's see. In the end, we're all wanderers moving through the world. When I think about it, who the fuck cares if my leg works? All that matters is that I can still get hard. Argentina isn't my home anymore. Mexico, fucker, has warmly embraced me. People love me. I probably have kids scattered everywhere. I might never know where I am. But one thing I do know. After all, it is I, Potro. Translated by: María José Gómez Viñolo
