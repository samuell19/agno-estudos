Just keep in mind that I and the boy are a candidate for hangin'. And the first time any one of ya makes a wrong move, I'm gonna kill the whole lot of ya! So keep your seat. You might pass me that rucksack that's beside you? - What do you want with it? - Well, I just wanna get out my life insurance policy. What do you want with your insurance paper? You're expecting to die? You guessed it, Mr. Maple. Cheers. Do you want sandwiches? No, we're fine Ray, thanks. We gotta get goin'. We'll be back tomorrow morning to touch him up, ok? If you need anything, Ray, give us a call. Thank you. He looks good. Thanks. Give me Juli, tell him it's Ray. Yeah, It's me. Drive fast, Juli. It's Ray. Did my brother get back? Get him over here, as soon as he gets back. Yeah, he's here. Give the message, tell him to hurry. Wait a minute. What are you doing? What are you doing? No, no! You clear with me before you deliver flowers from anybody outside my family, you understand? Victor! Victor! No more flowers unless it's ok by me, you understand? - What's the problem? - Out! Out! They give me an address, I deliver the flowers. I don't even know you. Come on! Come on! Out! Out! - Ray, they heard. - Stupid bastards. - They don't know who they're taking orders from. - All right, then now they know. Yes. Yeah, well, fuck them, and their flowers. Well, they didn't know, they don't know. How'd they know? Look at it. Here! Remember me! What did I say about making noise today? Come on, please! Please. What did I tell you about making noise today? Please, come on! It's serious, you gotta be quiet, please! You have to be quiet, all right? I'm not asking. You have to be quiet, all right. Ok, come on, come on! In the kitchen. Give me the guns! Give me these goddamn guns. Who bought then the guns to begin with? Jean, keep them quiet. All right. Go get the cots, please. All right. No guns today. Enough with guns. Why do you need guns to begin with, all right? Listen, be quiet now... Hey, Ray. Look. We've got three days, it's all right. Don't make it so foul, you know what I mean? Listen. The kids, they gonna drive you crazy. They don't understand what's going on. What you'd do. Let them say goodbye tonight. And make them go with my sister. - Believe me, it's the best thing. - They stay here, with their family. Gaspare has sent flowers. - So what? You send them back. Screw them! - What does that mean? I don't know. I don't even know what the fuck is goin' on. Anyway, he knows what I'm thinking. Yeah, he already knew what you were thinking. Come on. Get out of here, stupid fuck! Take out this fuckin' truck and get the fuck out of here. Get this piece of shit started and get out of here. The poor girl, standing there like a ghost... Jean, would you put together a plate for her or something. She looks like she's going to pass out. She's a big girl, she can find the way here. Let her alone. Hey Ray, Cesarino is here. Come on. Hello. Hi. Son, come here. Come here. Say goodbye to Uncle Johnny. Goodbye, Uncle Johnny. Good boy. Good boy! Go. Let's go in the kitchen. He's... He's just a kid, son. They killed him at 22 years old. They killed him. My baby brother. Just go in the kitchen, please. I'm good. All right. Thank you. So Ray, he sends Bacco and James after the ambulance guys. He says, you find out what the kid said on the way, you get a positive id on the scum fuck who did this. As if there's a doubt in his mind. When they come back, they said the only thing he could talk about was he shit in his pants. He kept crying like a baby because he thought he shit his pants. - "I think I shit my pants!" - "I shit my pants." The doc had to calm him and say: "Take it easy, you've got bigger things to worry about". But no, he kept crying and crying. They couldn't calm him down. "I think I shit my pants". Do you think he said who fuckin' shot him? Fuckin' idiot. What is Ray gonna do? The real question: what about that fuckin' crap of Chez. That's what scares me, the fuckin' loony. Who? - Hello, Victor. - Good evening, father. Sali... - How are you? - All right. I'm sorry about what happened. How are things going in there? You want my advice, father? Forget last rites there. What they need here is an exorcism. So you went all to the hospital. We went to the hospital. But to come and get there, the kid was already in the coma He died in the operation. He didn't got a chance to say nothing. - I don't know what... - Do you know what the fuck Ray says to me? "Pop should have been here to see us, he would have been proud of this." Hello, Jean. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm sorry you lost your brother Johnny. We have come together tonight to remember Johnny, our brother, and to say a prayer for him. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen. Let us pray. Dear God, we thank you for the life of your servant Johnny, and we ask to watch over him, and keep him safe in your everloving arms. Ray, at thirteen a Jewish boy becomes a man. They have a celebration they call Bar Mitzvah; it means "Son of the law." But this doesn't mean he's prepared to confront the world as a man. In fact, he's still a baby. He still carries fears in his heart, that he must overcome. The faster he conquers these fears, the faster he becomes a man. And the more he learns, the more he gets himself ready, the more prepared he is to live in this world. This man... has betrayed you. He has robbed the property of you and your brothers. He has to die because life doesn't allow enemies to live side by side forever. If he leaves here alive, he will eventually return to kill you. As long as we let him live, his life will always be in danger, because he'll be driven by the fear that one day we'll change our minds. There's one shell in the chamber. Kill him. I'm not doing it. Either you do it, or we set him free and you can wait for him to return. Kill him. Always carry this with you. Nothing will cost you more. Why don't you come back inside? Sure. After the asshole leaves. Don't talk like that You gotta be in there. I'm not about to stall with that stuff at this point, Jean. I asked Helen to stay over. - Okay? - Yeah. That was the right thing. There won't be any trouble. You go back to the house. Just bury him and let him take his fights with him. Whatever you're saying. Promise? Promise. They'll shoot you, like they shot him. And they'll shoot Chez too. Where are you going? What if they come here after the kids? What if they come after the kids? Get in here. Close the car. You know... What? You can make those cookies. You need special oven cooking. Do you know the pinoles, the ones that're up there? You do have to buy them in America. You know that? They're very expensive. They're considered like gold dust or sort of something. And at home, you're able to just find them? On the ground. Yeah., you crush them with a stone. Hi, Jean. - What's with a stone? - Hi. The pinoles. You get them on the stone, you press them and you get the nuts out. You've got to buy them here. Thank you for the good coffee. I'll see you tomorrow night, Clara. Thank you very much. - I'll walk you out. - Thank you. - Good night, honey. - Good night. If there's anything that I can do... Maybe pray for us. Jean, to be honest... The only way anything is going to change is if this family has a total reversal of heart. I don't mean just going to church on sunday mornings. It's the pratical atheism that all of you live daily. My family believes in God, Tommy. I don't think any of you are broken enough to believe in God. Well, maybe we need a miracle. Just pray for us, Tommy. Pray for yourself... Then you'll be ready to receive it. Good night. I will pray for you also, don't worry. Good night. Okay, son. Okay. What do you need? You're sure? I love you. I'm gonna get some air. I'm glad to say our speaker has finally arrived. I present to you the people's representative from Detroit, Michael Stein. Comrades! Thank you! Comrades! Thank you! Tonight, we'd like to address the latest charges leveled against us in the capitalist press. They accuse us of having abandoned the conventions of western democracy, and of being dictatorial materialists. They maintain a transcendental moral order is impossible under socialism, because being atheist procludes our participation in what is good, free and right. Come on. The election of Comrade White, a convicted political criminal, prove, as they say, our dedication to anarchy and immoral ideology. But why I'm here to explain to you tonight is that it is only the criminals, the criminals as they see it, that is, that can best leave this country from the corruption and shallowness, of the greedy and dying capitalist mentality. You see, what that bourgeois capitalist controllers don't want you to understand is that every new idea, every movement forward for humanity was, at one time or another, criminal and outlaw. And that's what they don't want you to understand, because then you would no longer be a slave to their greedy, dying, capitalist machine. You would no longer be a replaceable part in their machine, you would have control of your lives, you would have control of your work, you would have control of your ideas! That's how we move forward together. If every worker of the world would unite together, side by side, for freedom, we would fight. Fight, fight, fight! The factory, they've got cops around about 24 hours a day. 24 hours of the day, the place is a fortress, all right. So the industrials stick out the cops, fine. To get rid of the cops, the workers, they've got us. Whoever pays us' got us, John. Sali, you just don't use your head. You don't think enough. Yes, that's right. The masses have to be educated. Thank goodness for Comrade Stein. - Just get in the car. - What is it this time coming up? Piss, puke, crap? Jeez! You fuckin' skiff! You know, Johnny? My penis is a little bit sore. I was wondering if maybe... There's something I don't know... - Just drive the fucking car. - Who fouled me up... You, out! You! Out! Out! Get out, faster! Come on, move! Come here! Come here! Come here! Come here! You laugh at it, uh? Now, move. No monkey business, uh! Hands up! What a warning? Shut up, Sali! You, shut up! Just let get the fuck out of here! Radios! Ghouly, let's stop the romp. Let's go! - Let's go! - You'll tell that shithead, not one peace of merchandise moves until set off with the syndicate, you hear me? Johnny, Let's get outta here! - Now, a little light show, uh. - Ghouly, stop fuckin' around! Make sure you tell it, all right? Are you okay? You're okay? Right. Come one, Ghouly! - You shit yourself, so shut your mouth! - We've got to get outta here! Gaspare. - Ray, it's good to see ya. Take a seat. - How are you? Enrico Borghese, Ray Tampione. - Ray. - Nice to see you. - Gaspare. - That's my brother... Cesarino. How are you doin', Enrico? Johnny, my brother also. Gentlemen, what are we drinking? Waiter! A cognac. Big fun. You want a cognac? Nothing, thanks. No? Something else? Can I have something, I can't drink any alcoholic? Something. Soda pint, maybe? Fine. Ray, Henry owns "Capital Radio". He gives a lot of jobs to the people here, but with the financial crunch, he's beginnin' losing money. He's had to loosen people off, and now, some of these union people are giving him a hard time because of it. They're closing me down. They started burning trucks, supplies, they are attacking my little workers. The police are guarding the plant 24 hours a day but they can't be everywhere. It's a war, and it's costing both sides a great deal of money and vanquish. He wants to stay in business of course, he wants to give jobs to everyone he can. But after half a dozen years in this fuckin' depression, you just can't do it anymore, Ray. You just can't. He needs to cut back, way back. And he needs everyone who go along with him. Now he's heard we're all friends with the U.C.W., and he's wondering if we could put in a few good words for him. I'm wanting to give a week severance to lay-offs, and give 60% salary to the ones I keep. It's a good deal. What's our interest in this? A thousand dollars a month. You could hire a lot a workers for a thousand dollars a month. Bright boy! I run a business for profits, not for the benefit of mankind. I'm not the W.P.A. I know what's best for me and my factory, and my workers too. Somebody wants to work for me for what I'm willing to pay, fine, if not, get out, and let me hire somebody that does. You mean, like a scab, right? They're family men. Half the country is unemployed and looking for work. Is that what you call them? Yeah. Scabs. Look. Let me be honest with all of you. I don't like coming here and offering wide amounts to extorsion. - No, no. - I'd like to run my business in peace. You tell your union negociators. I'll take care or you, of them, and whoever they have on their list. The rest of the rack in file will have to fin for themselves like everyone else in the country. And that's the best I can do. Sounds to me like... you're trying to bust out the union. Johnny, shut up! He's not asking us to do anything, he's asking us not to do anything. We understand the problems of the country are good, economically or so. We're gonna talk it over and we'll be in touch. If you're really concerned about the workers, let them take the deal. Better some work than none. Yeah, right, right. Yeah. Well, anyway, we're gonna talk in a day or two. Thank you for your time. Nice to meet you, Enrico. Gaspare, take it easy. Gaspare, thanks. Jesus, what are you doing? What are you funckin' doing? Are you stupid, are you fuckin' stupid? Now, if you're not in on this, then tell us now. Right now, Johnny, not later. You know... you know what I think. What do you think? Are you in or you're not in? Are you in or you're not in? So you wanna take the dough, right? - We take the money. - We take the money. And we stick together, for Christ sakes. You know where you're going? You're looking for trouble. You're looking for trouble! We haven't got all night. I can't start the car! It must be nice to be a social licker, all right Ghoul? Don't you remind me a boy? You know those guys who used to come back from the war when we were kids? Those crazy guys used to cast themselves out and crowl the streets, looking for some crap easters. They couldn't eat, or get laid like normal people right. They had to live in a filthy crazy world. You wanna fight and drink, and ass-fuck, right? You're a pig, Ghouly, you're a filthy... filthy diseased pig! You're the kind of person they should keep out at the border, instead of quarentine the TB patients. You know, he's got no conscience. Yes I do. I've got a conscience. I'll be sorry for this later, much, much later. Oh. God damn! Do you know what... your problem is? You read too many books, you know that? Too many fuckin' books, fucking up your brain. It's the American tragedy, Ghouly, we need something to distract us. It's all we've got, these books, you know? Maybe the radio and the movies keeps us alive. I'd say, life is pretty pointless, wouldn't you, without the movies. I'd say, you gonna go to hell, for talking like that. You're a bad girl, Bridget. You did that for me? Yes? You want to kiss me on the mouth, after that? Come here, nauhty boy. Come on, let's go. - Hey, Ghouly! - What? Do that dance, the new dance, what do you call it? That's your best night. I can dance for you on your own very night, Chez. I shall do my world-famous dance: "Eat shit for breakfast." You look at this guy? Hey Ghouly, I don't think there's got a job at the Cotton Club for you. Hey, Gaspare, come on in! Gaspare, hey! - Come on in! - Gaspare... Hope you're ready to get blind. Drinks're on me. - What do you ask? - I'll have a cognac. A cognac. Same for you, Billy? - Nice to have your own bar. - Yes. Good luck to Cesarino! I'll have a cognac with you. Cheers! Cheers! Hey, Gaspare, how are you? What the hell are you doin'? Loosing your brains, jumping around like that. Do you want me to teach this? You've got the perfect name. Ghouly... In English, it means scary monster, which you are, and in Italian, it means asshole, which you also are. He's funny! I'm glad you like it. I will show you a dance you'll like. Let's dance, come on. You look so handsome in this suit. I wanna dance with you. Not the Gatsby you were in politics paralyzed your legs? John. You've got to take him home before he says anything else about politics. Oh, yeah? He ain't taking me anywhere. Next thing you know, Eudipe... change your name to Spool to set it sound more republican. - Shut up! - It's a joke. - Shut up! - It was just for fun. - Shut up! - I'm playin' here! You're going over the light. You gonna get yourself in trouble. Shut your fuckin' trap! Let him have this fun. I know. I don't even get mad at what you're doing now. You know, Gaspy? I ain't afraid of you. Get the fuck out, Ghouly. That's it! You crossed the line, that's it. You're in big trouble now. Get outta here! Johnny, take him out of here. Take him out of here! Now! - Chez, I wanted just... - Get the fuck out of here! He decides. He decides, that's it. Chez, come on. Do something, do a thing. Sing a song. Make us laugh. Make us laugh, Chez, come on! Everybody, come on down here! - He has a big mouth, you know what I'm saying? - He had a few drinks, that's it. - Well, you should cut him off. - And what do you want me to do? Birds of a feather fuck together, Johnny. Yeah. You're the man, all right? - Come on, we'll have a few drinks. - I'll say hello to Marco. - Hello to Marco, right there. - Hey, Marco, hey ho, how are you? You got a real problem with vitality functions, don't you? I see... That gut in your veins, does it allow you... to feel anything? Ghouly, you're a real asshole. Hey, Chez! Open up! Open up! Shut up! It's about fuckin' time. Where the hell where you? Clara and the kids are asleep, Johnny. I'm sorry. You know Bridget. This is my brother Cesarino. Everybody calls him Chez. Bridget Spoglia. You want a drink? This? This is the choice. It's all we've got. You wanted it too? Here. I hope you don't mind Chez, right? I had to get out of that party. The place sucked. It's Gaspare's wife. Fuckin' asshole! Fuckin' asshole! You had to say that? You had to say that? Yeah, she's Gaspare's wife. Big deal! She regrets it everyday of her life. It's not your problem, Chez. You heard? Go upstairs, get dressed. - We're going to town. - You're not going anywhere, Johnny. Johnny, we're not going anywhere. What are you... What are you sweating about? I thought we're in business with Gaspare, all right. We're all in it together, right? So why would he mind. Now, come on. Come on. Be nice. Try to take Bridget home. - What'd you say? - Take her home. - Take her home? - That's what I said. Forget about it. I'll only take her home when I get laid. All right. You're out of your fuckin' mind. Fuckin' crazy. You're crazy. Chez! What the fuck you think you're doin' here? - This is my house! - Chez, don't shout. My house! Chez, stop it! This is your house? This ain't nothing, Chez, This is nothing. - This ain't nothing. - Stop it, please! Stop it! Johnny, leave him alone! Leave him alone, Johnny! When he finds out that we torched the store... What do you think he's gonna do when he finds that out? This is nothing here. - Johnny, what're you saying? - This is nothing. - Nothing. - What are you tryin' to do? What am I tryin' to do? You sold your fuckin' soul! Johnny, stop! And you, stop it! You, back off! Back the fuck off and don't do that shit on me! Shut the fuck up! What? Tell me, come on tell me. Tell me, Johnny, tell me what? ?You, back off! Don't you fuckin' get in the middle of us. Don't you get in the middle of us or I beat your fuckin' head too! - What, you tell me? - Now you stop that! Shut up! Very nice, that's beautiful. You sell your soul for 300 bucks a week and you lecture me, right like an asshole! That's what you do? You stink the ground you walk on. You're nothing. Nothing, nothing. If you wanna make that scumbag rich, that's fine, Chez. Just leave me out of it, all right? Leave me out of it! Because I shit on you I shit on you now. You're nothing to me I shit on you and him. And I'll tell you something, Chez. You wanna get in bed with him? You wanna get in bed with that guy? What, John? Then you'd better watch at yourself. You'd better watch at your place too. - Watch at... - You heard what I said. You heard me. Stop it! Stop it! ...Bullshit. No Chez in here? No, he was gonna get some cigars. - When? - In... about an half hour from now. We stopped earlier to get some on the way here. That's what he told me, Clara. I don't know. He will be back soon. - Do you need anything? - No, no. Who is that? Santa Agnes. They slit her throat because she refused the advances of some guy. She was just 12 years old at the time. They still have her headless body in some church in Italy. She's the patron saint of purity. Do you pray to her? No. She's just there to remind me what happens when you say no. I will never sleep tonight. Just lye there. Like Johnny. Ties up... So the ship does when it comes out of the harbour. Ties up. I was doin' the same for you when you were 7. Ties up. Okay... Ah, yeah Why, no, no, no need of it! Yeah, I think that's enough. It's enough of that. Enough of this shit. I hate morbide shit. A friend I was visiting, his brother said to me: "Look at him, it doesn't even look like him, it just looks like you." What is it like? Answer me. What's it like? It's not bad? You know? Ever since I was a kid, I refused to buy into that. I used to go and look at, you know... Uncle Les... At that time, I never bought it when I looked at him, I didn't believe it. I just don't believe people die. But you know... you get to do it all for another, if you're lucky. But you were lucky, you know. You got luck... Such a good hand. So beautiful, so smart, so nice... Everybody liked you. What the fuck has happened with you? It's so stupid, you know... That is a waste. Everybody was... wanted to be like you. Yes, anyway... You got it a break. You got a good break the other day, too! Because you look better now than you ever did, you know that? I know you don't like it, but believe me. What happened to you the other day, was a good thing. Bastards! You fuckin' bastards! What's... What's he doing? Hey, Ray! I've seen this before. Here's something you've ever seen on. labour relations. Right, Ray? This is the reward of capitalist technology. Well. You're the one with the balls. Don't be a bastard. Yeah, Ray. Hey, guys, guys, guys! Let's organize labour, uh? Very romantic. Have a sip, you look pallid, Anna. Hey, you want a job? All right, let's go. ...You want a job... This movie... This movie's really making me hot. - Anna... - It's all right. It ain't... It's not ok. - It's not ok. - Why? Well, because you're a baby. - No, I'm not. - Yeah, you're a baby. You're a child. Look at your face. You're a child! You're a beautiful girl... Come on... What's wrong? You don't know nothing about "come on". All you know is, uh... Whatever you know. Go home Go home! I'm gonna give you five dollars.. I'll give you five dollars, just go home. You don't need this. You can have a life. All right? Five dollars. I'm giving you the five dollars and just go home. Well, why don't you just give me ten and fuck? It's the money... How about I give you twenty? What if I gave you twenty... Do you know why? You know why I may give you twenty? - Why? - Because... you just... sold your soul. You sold your soul. You got twenty but you've sold your fuckin' soul, you little tramp! Fuckin' tramp! You wanna fuck? Don't say a fuckin' word, you stupid bitch! You gonna be a tramp for the rest of your live, now! - For the rest of your fuckin' filthy... - No, no, no, please. Shut up! Shut, up! Shut up! You sold your soul. You took twenty. - Don't fuck with the Devil. - No, please, no. Don't fuck with the Devil! I gave you the fuckin' choice! I gave you a choice! Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Shut up! That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right... That's right. That's all right. You're home early. I left the guys... kept talkin' around at the club. I was tired. It's Saint Dymphna of Geel. She's a Belgian saint. Geel is a famous town. For what, I never heard of it? It's a treatment center. The whole town is like one big hospital. As soon as a patient get out of the ward, they live with the family, they work they go back into the community. It's the only treatment like that in the world. They take care of the mentally ill. And the cure rate is the highest in Europe and she's the patron saint. Why are you praying to her? Cesarino... No one will know why we went there. I'll know. It was just an idea. For a chek-up, that's all. A bad idea. - Don't get mad, that's all right. - I'm not getting mad. I'm not getting mad. I just... I don't like... the thoughts... that you have about me. I don't like... - I just want you in peace. - You do? Clara... If God wanted me in peace, he would see through that stuff. You know who's in peace? My father. He's in peace. Is that what you want for me? No. Then shut up. I heard the shot. I went into the garage, and he was in the back, inside the car, with the shotgun across his chest. They wouldn't let his wife see him. They can't even bury him in a Catholic cemetery. A woman and three boys. Is this how you take care of your family? Such a disgrace. Now what are these poor people supposed to do? What a sin! What a sin! Ray, I got here as soon as I could. Sorry. Thanks. - You want? - Thanks, Ray. Well? It's the Spoglias. You're sure? Definitely. And if it's them, you think that finished? Before we start banging these guys, I think we'd better be sure of what we're doing. What? Do you know what Johnny was doing? Gaspare's wife, three times a week. Taking action doesn't belong to him. I'm saying there's extenuating circumstances that you should take into consideration, Ray. Extenuating? With all due respect, you're his brother, ok? Maybe if you had smacked his head for once in a while, this wouldn't have happened. Do you want me to thank them? Yes? Maybe you think it is a good idea. - Ray. - They killed my brother. This thing was bound to happen. It was bound to happen! And I just wanna say, think of the risks.. What, are you happy, that they shot him? I look happy? ?Are you happy? - Do I look happy? - Are you happy? Enough! I didn't come here for aguments. I'm not asking for nothing but my brother's killer. His motivation does not interest me. I want you to pick uo Spoglia, take him to the club and... You, go with them, if you want to. - Who was that? - It's Juli. To see Johnny. Send him home. Jean... I'm gonna be blunt. The guy that killed Johnny, is not gonna go free. The guy who killed Johnny is not your fuckin' concern, Ray. Do you think about what might happen to your family? I see what it's done to my family. It's inside in a box. Killing somebody else is not gonna bring him back. Remember one thing. - He's not your flesh and blood. - Yeah, but if he was, I would have done more for him than give him a fuckin' gun. You're so full of shit. Right. Now who's getting revenge? Look, if I wanted revenge, Ray, I'd let you kill the son of a bitch in way for you to burn in hell for it. You wanna get deep on this shit? All them catholics gonna say, everything we do depends on free choice. But at the same time, they say we need the grace of God to do what's right. I thought of that, Jeanie. If I do something wrong, is because God didn't give me the grace to do what's right. Nothing happens without His permission, so... if... this world stinks, it's His fault. I'm only working with what I've been given. Then when the people they find have bullet holes in their skulls, it's God's fault? - Ain't you ashamed of yourself? - Ashamed of nothing. I didn't make the world. You're not doing anything to make it better. Yeah, and I'll roast in hell. Maybe tomorrow after the funeral I'll leave. Take the kids. I need a drink. Do you like a glass of whisky? A sip. On me. To John Temple. We ought to be throwing you a party because of this. You ought to be celebrating in fact that you 're going to become one of their wives. Temples... pass themselves off as tough, broaden individualists, and we fall for it. But they're criminals. They're criminals because they never resign about their heartless, illiterate upbringing. And there's nothing, absolutely nothing romantic about it. Just look at how they handled in John's death. Everyone says the thought of love for their brother crossed their mind. I think Chez is diferent. You do? Yeah, Chez suffers. But from insanity. He's just got his old man's blood in his veins, and he's gonna end up splashin' his brains against the wall, just like him. I went to Manhattanville College for two years before I marry Ray. I learnt how to read books. And I have memories. I have ideals. That's it! But I was young, you know? And it's my fault as much as it is his. I do look like an idiot. Close the lights whenever. - Ray. - Sit down. I'm sorry about Johnny. Look at me, when I'm talking to you. Turn the fuckin' chair around and look at me when I'm talking to you. He was fucking your wife. You know that. It was him, two or three times a week. And it was him who took down your shops. You know that too. You know that, right? I have no reason to doubt that, Ray. But it seems to me that the real problem here is that you knew about it. There's an oilcloth hovering there. - Spread it under him. - Wait. Ray, I'm gonna say it once. I've got nothing to do with your brother's death. All right. Talk to me, Gaspare. Talk to me. We're just a bunch of street punks. Nobody's watching us. We gotta act a certain way. We're free. We do anything we want. What I'm saying is for sure. Think about the possible consequences. Then I'd kill an "inocente". Innocent man. What do you want me to do with you? Shoot you? - Why don't you do it now? - In front of your wife and your children? - Why don't you do it now? - This what you would like to do? Shoot me. Shoot me. When I had you brought here, I was praying that you'd be a man, and admit it was you. What would you like me to do? Lie? That'd be nothin' new, you're lying now. You know what? Is it stupidity, is it greed or pride that makes people like us kill each other? We should be thanking over the Ford Motors Company instead of shooting each other. But I understand what the problem is, it's people like you. You cannot be trusted, you are not trust-worthy. It's the flaw in the criminal character. If you did not kill the kid, who did it then? I don't know it. But, at this point I almost wish I had. At least I'd have the satisfaction of going through this for a reason. Beside that I'm sorry about your wife and the stores, you got a reason. Since you never gonna forgive me for this, you leave me no choice, but to chop your legs off and slit your throat. I can thank your brother for putting me in this position. - And don't forget Ghouly either. - Fuck you. And your wife, your kids, your house, your car, and the three bastards you came with. You had no right for coming after me like this, with that stupid and mistaken idea that it was I... I... that killed that left-wing brother of yours. The anarquist cuntass. No, no, no. Johnny... was a communist. Let's take a ride. This party is for you, got it? ...this is your shitty fuckin' house. - What's the idea, Ray? - Come in. - What's the idea? - Come close. Pay your respects. Don't be afraid, it's only a dead body. What's the idea, Ray? Juli, take Gaspare to his home. - Ray, are you crazy? - No, take him home, Juli. He's not the one who did it. How do you know he didn't fuckin' do it? There's an old tradition. It says the wounds of the victim bleed if his killer enters the room. That's why gangsters never go to each other's funeral. - You gonna be sorry later, Ray. - No, no. You're making the right choice, Ray. I just gonna go home, and go to sleep. If there's anybody I had to kill,... my wife. Well, if you want it... it's your woman. But, be nice. Ray, Ray. We found the guy who did it. He's a mechanic. I've got him in my store. Shoot Gaspare. On his front lawn. You know, in front of his children, and in front of his wife. It turns out that the kid is a fuckin' grease monkey. He took one of the Fords from his shop. We tracked down the owner. He says: "That car has been at the mechanic's all week." That's how we found the fuckin' idiot. He's in the cooler. Come on. Get out of here! Get out if here. Come! Come on. Sit down. Is it true what they say? Answer in fuckin' English, uh! Fuckin' cunt. Is it true? Why did you do it? Answer when somebody's speaking to you! Why did you shoot him? He raped my girlfirend. What do you mean? I mean he beat the shit out of her and then he raped her. And I don't care what you'll do to me. If he was here right now, I'd do the same thing. And so would you, if it happened to somebody you loved. Who is she? Her name is Amelia DiPatrone. When did this happen? The night before, the last I've seen her. Who told you it was Johnny? There was no mistake. Everybody knows your brother. - Tie his wrists and get him in the car. - Please! Ray, Ray. It's getting late, why don't you go home and relax. We'll take care of this piece of shit. Get him in the car. Don't get crazy, right. If you get crazy, it's when people get slapped. Look, I'm not crazy. Chez. Chez, where have you been? I've been worried sick. Angel... Do you wanna talk? I don't wanna talk, Clara. Take off your robe. How do you think in naughty... Talk to me. I don't wanna talk. Take off your robe. What about all the people over here. Take off your robe. Take it! Come on! Come on, don't get mad. Come on. Were you going to marry this girl, if they didn't find you? I don't know. What would you do with her if I let you go? I don't know. I'd stay out of trouble, that's for sure. I'd move quiet. If I'd got the nerve of, I'd get married to her. I'd have kids, and a family.. Look, I'm sorry, Mister. I'm really sorry about what I did, but I had a reason for it. And that's more than your brother Johnny had. Tell me the truth. I told you the truth. No. The way God sees it. All right. Johnny gave me a beatin' in front of my friends and my girlfriend, and I wanted to teach him a lesson, you know... I made up... I made up the thing about the rape. I thought that maybe... maybe if I had a good enough excuse, that you would let me go. And... shit. I've got nothing to loose now. I lost my temper. Right. Come away from the car. What are you gonna do? Come away, from my car. Over there, get over. You think you deserve to live? You killed a man! And two men are dead over this. Can you live with that on your conscience? Please, just let me go, I'd do whatever you want me to do. Please, let me go. Once you pull a trigger, there's no going back. My wife, who don't even know you, has pleaded for your life. She asked me to let the law punish you, and keep my hands clean. If Johnny had raped your girl, I would have let you live, for her sake, but... You acted under anger, you're dangerous, you... You've got no respect for life, people like you... have no place in society. And jail is a kindness you don't deserve. I don't see I've got a choice... Yes, you do. Just... Don't pull the trigger. What about my sense of justice? What about me? You have the chance to do something good instead of something bad, and that's better than justice. You killed my brother. Maybe one day, they're gonna find me with my blood draining into the sewer And when I'm dead, I'm gonna roast in hell. I believe that. But... The trick is, get used to the idea why are we here, cause... Hey, Johnny! Johnny! What do you want? Somebody, call a doctor! Help me. Help me. Just take it easy, kid. Stay still. It's already dark... My eyes went blind... Play still. I found who did it. Hey, Chez. How are you doin'? Ray! Chez! Chez! Chez! No, Chez! Chez! Chez, give me the gun! Don't be so hard, please, please. Give me the gun, Chez. Come on, Chez. Give me the gun. Come on. Chez, give it to me. And live without my brothers? Chez! Stop it! No! What did he do? Come on, Ray! Ray! No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no!
