Are you okay? - Don't you even look where you're going? - I'm so sorry. - I was 72 bottles away from buying my beauty chair. You just ruined it, you just ruined it. Sale ends on Friday. Thanks a bunch. - Look, I'm really sorry, sunshine. I tell you what, why don't I pay you when I get my next paycheck? - Just go. The damage is done. - But we know there is a God, and we are going all the way down to Sheba, southwest Arabia, and get on inside, and this sweet king... - Now, you stop that foolish talk. I'm not gonna close up your shop. You'll make the rent once that bridge is done. You're late. - I'm sorry. - Why do you let Lottie Strickland fill your head with such nonsense? That woman could screw up a two car funeral. - Ma'am? - What is it angel? - I just wanted to make sure that you thought this color would fit in alright with your decor? - I'm on the telephone. - Yes ma'am. I just wondered if you might give me an advance on my monthly check? See the sale ends on Friday. And I was... - We can talk about it later. - Yes ma'am. See, this guy he just busted up all my bottles. - Aw, that's rich. - Well, I was thinkin' that I could pay you back with interest. - No, of course not. - Does that mean you'll do it? You'll give me the loan? - I told you this over and over. - About the loan, is that a yes? - It's a no. - The saga begins with Kunta Kinte, an African youth captured by slave raiders then brought to America in chains, 1767. Powerful story of Kunta's odyssey in the new world, and his ancestor's journey to freedom. Hmm, they turned that book into a story. No wait, that there's my work station. - Careful, I can't get that deposit money if it's chipped. - Now who bust your balloon? - Don't wanna talk about it. - Fine then. Bye. - Listen to this. Last year's model on clearance. Supple pleather that's easy to clean, never cracks or breaks. Soft to the touch. - Shirley ain't gonna let you ever touch nothin'. 'Cept that mop bucket. - No, she told me. I buy myself a chair and pass the hair shaping test, I can go pro. Legit. - Shirley ask you to jump, you gonna say how high? How far? Ain't got no backbone. Shoot. You gonna stay right as you is, Shirley's mule. - Hush up. - No, I don't take orders from you. - Yes. Yoo hoo. I gotta go, my ten o'clock just walked in. Bye. Talk the hair off a coconut. Darlin', let's start our lesson. - Yes ma'am. - Note, the downward angle of my comb. This is called... - Back-combing, yes ma'am. - Now, see how my scissors go upward. This is called... - Feather edge. Yes ma'am. - When are you gonna show me your hair ideas? Final exam's comin' up on Monday. Needs to meet with my approval. - As soon as I get my nerve up. - Oh honey, why are you nervous? We're all family here. You can't let anybody think you're hungry for somethin'. Let them always think you're full. Mabel, are you as parched as I am? - Growin' hair on my tongue. - Violet, run over to the diner and grab us a Crush. And ask Dee to nuke me a Goober. When you come back, we'll talk about that beauty chair, kay? - Kay. - Nobody believes in you like I do, peanut. - Ain't none of Washington's stinkin' business who I hire. This is a Louisiana bridge. - Yeah, but it's federally funded and man you know what's up. You don't hire 'em, you lose your job. I'm not a racist. You know I love coons when they know their place. And every time I put on a cotton shirt, I say, "Thank you Lord for the Negros "that picked this cotton." - Listen, I'm not lookin' for trouble, OK. I'm just here to enforce the law and finish the bridge. Hey, I would appreciate a proper introduction with your workers before you go. - You're gonna need all the introducin' you can get. Men ain't gonna take kindly to your getup. - Hey Jimmie, get those pipes up on the deck. Hey cupcake, you need me to loan you a dollar for a haircut? - I don't know man. I wouldn't say anything if I was you. Looks like you got a little hair issues of your own. - I'll say whatever I want. - Bud Henry, your new supervisor. - Smitty? What happened? - Thumb suckers in Washington had to put in their two cents. Brought in a real expert for hirin' Negros. - Alright, thank you. - What the? - 'Preciate you given us these jobs. Oh, my pleasure. - They can't work here. - Oh no, don£t mind this gimp. I can swing a hammer just as good as any man. - Oh that ain't it. You're black. - Oh crap, you're black? I thought this was a skin condition. Just a little joke. Anyways, OK, now that we've established what color we all are, let's get to work, huh? Take one of these. Thank you very much. Thank you. Alright. - Look I don't want to cause you any problem but if it's alright by you, we'll just go. - What? No, no, no, no. - You can't treat 'em like they're equal, boss. That ain't how we flow here. - How we supposed to treat 'em? - You don't hire 'em. You go by our rules. Or that bridge won't get done. - Look, I assure you that bridge will get done so why don't you just help me out or I'm gonna find some folks who will? - The 1977 new Chevrolet... - One nuked Goober and a Crush. No bottles in the trash today, hon. - Ms. Dee? - Eugene, honey? If I wasn't working, you would not be safe. - Acting like she don't see me when I know she did. - Mhmm. - Roots, the event of the year, premiers Sunday. - Watch your step. Got cat eyes? I can't see in the dark. Oh I see another one. Yeah. - You ever think about mama? Where she is? - I try hard not to. - Maybe she's in jail. And maybe, she got run over by a trucker. - And maybe she ran off with one. I warned her, a man is like a blizzard. - How's a man like a blizzard? - You never know when he's gonna come or how long he'll last, or there's one other thing, but it's been so long since I've seen a Peter. She'd be real proud of ya. A certified beautician. Real proud. - What if Shirley doesn't like my designs? - Oh, Shirley ain't Moses. Now you have a gift for hair. Don't you let her tell you otherwise. - Does that mean you'll let me take your wig off and give you a foxy look? - Well I'll tell you what. You let me get rid of some of this weight, and that'll be my reward. - Sweet Jesus, I love it. - Dial down the color before you blind somebody. - This isn't what Violet ordered. A person works her way up to a chair like this. - Well, lady said since it was you Ms. Shirley, she gave Violet an upgrade. - Oh, well, I... I don't know how that's gonna look to people. You havin' a better chair than me. And the pump on mine's not even pumpin'. But, don't you worry about me. I'll just bend over. - Oh. - Perhaps I could use your chair just until mine's fixed? You haven't even passed the hair shapin' test yet anyway. - I'd be honored if you'd use my chair. - Joe, take that old chair to the dump. - Until Monday. - Why are you always so obedient? Are you a house pet or something? - I get my chair back after the test. - Mmmhmm. - I will. - Well, good luck to you, Ms. Violet. - Thank you. - Time to lock up now, sweet pea. - Oh, I just want to look at my chair a wee bit longer. - You just take your time, darlin'. Look at your new chair all you want. That's long enough. - Seat patrons how? - Comfortably. - And then? - Wash and sanitize hands. - When is pre-softening required? - When hair is resistant to color. - Bingo. - Let us all rise for the call and response. Page 291 in your hymnals, led today by our Lottie Moon chair, Shirley Weaver. - Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God is with us. Let us give thanks and praise. - What common diseases would prevent a cosmetologist from working? - The Earth is full of his glory. Thanks be to God. - TB, ringworm, scabies, and head lice. - Let us lift up our hearts. We lift them up Lord. - What two things must the cosmetologist avoid? - And be thankful for his grace. - Bad breath and body odor! - Amen. Amen. - Darlin', you are ready to advance to the hair cuttin'. - You're it. - Roots is on! Roots is on! - Now this one sits pretty good when I add the phone book. - It better. You know, Roots gonna be on for eight straight nights. Lord, I never seen so many black people on TV at one time. - Tonight, we present a landmark in television entertainment. Roots, the true story Alex Haley uncovered in his search across the seven generations of his ancestry. From primitive Africa to the old South. - I seen Africa in the encyclopedia they was givin' away with a five dollar purchase, but I took the gravy boat instead. - Now, we are proud to present the triumph of an American family, Roots. - Where in hell's Baretta? - Up all night. Couldn't sleep. I ain't never seen nothin' like that on TV before. I mean, I read about it in the book, but still when you see that thing in color, shhh, whole 'nother story. You know they pack them folk up in there like they was hogs on their way to the slaughter in the belly of that ship? Felt so real, I felt like I could smell them bodies. Felt so real, I felt like I could smell that misery on that ship. - Do you have any idea what those pigeons are doin' to Jesus? Poopin' all over him. We're meeting at the Parsonage to discuss what to do about it. I'll be back in an hour. Then, we'll head on over to Baton Rouge, the exam. - Every time I turn around it's like they bleachin' out Jesus white. - You gotta problem with that? - Ma'am? - Have you got any hard candy or chewin' gum? - No ma'am. Before you go, could you approve my hair sketch? - Oh Violet, I'd love to. Violet, I never asked you this because I'd assumed you'd read this. His son bled and died for you. Don't you think he sees this? Don't you think he's saddened? No, sickened by this. - I'm sorry. I really never meant to offend. - I think it look good. - Is that my good glass? Get you one of those jelly jars. - You know my ancestors were African kings and queens? Now royalty don't drink out of jelly jars. - Your mama was jacked up on Thunderbird. She was certified crazy. - Yeah no wonder she went crazy 'cause she was a queen who was given a push broom. - We will continue this black and angry conversation when you're off the clock. Now, put my good glass back. Remember, you work at my pleasure. When you do the job I think you should do, then you get to keep that job. Violet, this won't do. I will be back in an hour. - No, now don't you let that wind bag rattle you. That hairdo, that's sexy. Even Helen Keller could see that. - No, no, she's certified. She's the expert. - Well I might not got no PhD behind my name, but I know what an artist is, and Violet, you is an artist. - Pullin' my leg? Please don't be pullin' my leg. - I don't pull legs. You need some swagger. A little self belief. Talk to me about some good glass. What the hell about good glass? Hairstyle all crazy. - Hey, do you know where I could find the Sheriff? - Do you see that big gold sign down by the Town Hall that say Sheriff? - Yes, the big sign. - And why you got Dutch boy shoes on? - They're clogs. - Oh. Well they funny. - Thank you. - Not haha funny. - Oh. I'm Bud by the way. - And where you from, Bud? - I am from Boston. Do I look out of place or somethin'? - Well you clearly aren't from around here. Shit, your shirt's so past this time even for this two bit town, and everything here about ten years behind. - Okay. Ahh! - Oh, you hurt? - No, I'm fine, I'm cool. Thanks sunshine. I use this hand a lot. Not like that. No, no, no, God no. Not like that. I mean I do. I do, everyone does, because it's natural. Women do it too. It makes you feel like you're giving a little present to yourself. I am not saying that you do though, so... I should probably book. Need directions for the door? - No, thank you. - Ms. Clara? - Where's Shirley? - Over at the church discussin' the bird droppins on Jesus. - Shit. Shit. You know those home permanent kits? The ones with Cheryl Tiegs on the cover? - Mhmm. - Glory hallelujah. - When's she back? - She's gonna be back in an hour. - What? - In an hour. - Fuzzy is takin' me on vacation to Biloxi. You gotta do somethin' before he sees me. Now! - Don't you worry, Ms. Clara. I'll get her. You ready for some sausage? Oh yeah. - Ohh. - I know you ain't used to somethin' like this, but it look good. She been to that beauty college. She know what she doin... - Violet, please. You gotta save my hair. - What? No, I couldn't. Not without Shirley's permission. - Then, I'll do it myself. - What is wrong with you? Spin those trainin' wheels off now. - Watch the door. - Yeah.

I'm gon' save you like I always do. - Alright, I got the liquor. Let's hit that ro... - Fuzzy, I can explain. - Jesus. Goodbye Betty Ford. Hello Angie Dickinson. Bye now, thank you. - I look forward to seein' our replacements. - They'll be lined up out the door. - Can I have my chair back? - Possession is nine-tenths of the law. - What is it honey? - Memaw, I let you down. - You forgot my Kools? - No, I got f-f-f... - You did not. - I did so. - What in Sam Hill happened? - Clara, she came into the shop all... - Yeah. - And so I went to get Ms. Shirley, and she and the Sheriff were... - Shit. - And I did Ms. Clara's hair myself. And then I got fired. - Thank you Jesus. Free at last. - What? - This is opportunity knockin'. Bloom where planted. You start your own shop. - Like with flowers on the walls and my own customized beauty box. - Yes, yes. - Where I can do my own stylish and exotic kind of hairdos. That's crazy talk. - Well, maybe it is and maybe it ain't. But don't lie down like a baby. You are a flower Violet. Now you bloom. Tell you what, I'm gonna let you do my hair. - You will? - Yeah, yes. If I don't believe in you, who will? Yes indeedy. Let me go take off this nasty wig. - My own shop. That's a joke. You were just funnin' with me, weren't ya Memaw? Aren't ya? Memaw? Memaw! - After the eulogy, hymns are optional, but they do allow time for the casket to be pushed. - What's she doin' here? I don't know what that colored girl's doin' here. - What am I gonna do? What am gonna do about Memaw's hair? - I never knew Memaw was so beautiful. - My gosh her hair is so soft. Oh, Shirley. - Shirley. - She looks so... - So... - So, it's your best work yet. - I have never seen anything like it. How could somebody look so much better all dead? - Honey, it's time to go. - I heard about your loss, I'm sorry. Real sorry. - Thank you. - You wanna share my lunch? - I think I just need to be solo. My nerves are just shot. - That's understandable. Well if you need someone to talk to, I understand loss. My parents are divorced and I was in 'Nam, so... It was good to see you. - Could I ask you something? - Are you tryin' to give me a conniption? - Sorry. - And when the hell you start smokin'? - Oh, I haven't. I just hold it in my mouth. It's all I got left of Memaw. I don't light it. If I light it then she'd be gone. - What'd she smoke? - Kools. They kind of minty. But, this one's gettin' a little soggy. It sticks to my lips. - Damn. You got it bad, kid. - Do you believe in signs? - Like no trespassin' and boiled peanuts. - No, no, I saw a hairdo. In the clouds. I think it was a sign from Memaw. - To do what? - Custom-fitted hair. Styled to the person right in my own shop. - Sweet baby Jesus and cousin Beulah in heaven, I was thinkin' the same thing. - When are they gonna show all the good stuff we did for 'em. - My great-great granddaddy owned half this town. He was a prominent planter with a lovely plantation, 120 slaves. His slaves were happy. He told me they would sing, sing in the fields. Yes, my family were always kind to the coloreds. Even after the loss. - Where does this go? - Shirley, before you tease, I have a request. Let's see, where did I put it? Here it is. I snuck back in after the viewing to take this. In my humble opinion, it is by far, hands down your biggest triumph. Can you do the exact same on me? - Oh really? You like this? I call this my casket spray. This hairstyle is only reserved for the dead. - Oyster inside the clam shell. And at $45 a month. - How many times I gotta tell 'em, it's cracker with a C. - What do you think? - Crazy fool, I wouldn't work in this broke down place. There's five coats of paint on the window. We gonna see a woman on the moon before we ever see the sun. - We could do some scrubbin'. - You and who? - Have a sign outside. With both of our names. - Alright. Now how you see me fittin' in? - What could you do? - Well. I mean ain't no artist like you, but I can boss. And I got a business sense. An expertise, which you are sorely lacking. Think of it like, where would Elvis be without the Colonel? - What else you got? - Where'd you get all this? - Washin' clothes for white folk. Savin' up to go to college. Law school so I can become a lawyer. - A lawyer? - Yeah, like the black Perry Mason. - What? You think scrubbin' white folk's bloomers was my dream? What you got? Girl, that's it? - Smilie, would you take seven-fifty? OK, I understand. - No, don't move. Smilie, seven-fifty gonna get us how long? - 'Bout five days. - Here's what, we gonna charge four-fifty a head, and that'll take us ten hairdos to make the $45. - Plenty of bad hair in this town. - Don't I know it. But if we fail, and I lose my Ironside money... Smilie, what's your verdict? - I'l take your seven-fifty, but come Monday, you gotta have the 45 in full. - What are we all standin' around for? ♪ Better days are coming ♪ ♪ No more sad romantic slumming ♪ ♪ No more, punching someone else's clock ♪ ♪ Call and I'll come runnin' ♪ ♪ I got better things to do I have♪ ♪ No time left for you ♪ ♪ It's time to ♪ ♪ Raise the roof let's take a chance ♪ ♪ Raise yourself, don't need a man ♪ ♪ Gonna rise up and make a stand ♪ ♪ Gonna take everything you can ♪ ♪ Raise the roof, we gonna raise the roof ♪ ♪ No more whats for dinner baby ♪ - Oh my goodness.

Just gone. - Ouch. - It's alright. People leave things. Socks get left in the dryer bin. Puppies get left. Jesus was left. - And your dad? - I never met him. But, mama probably ran off to be with him. Your parents are divorced? - Mhmm. Thought they had a happy marriage, but eh. One day my dad started looking like the Hunch back, and then my mom would ask him to straighten up and he would, and 15 minutes later, he'd be back to hunchin'. And then she started chain smoking, and she shaved her head and she moved in with her friend Carol. It's cool, I don't know. - You got any pets? - Not anymore. - Not even a little fish or a guinea pig? - No, I move around a lot so... - Did you ever think about stayin' in one place and puttin' down roots? - I don't know, why? - So you can get a guinea pig. - Oh. - I gotta get back to work. - Hey, it's gettin' really late. Don't you want to go home? - I don't like to go back to the trailer since Memaw died. It's just so quiet. - Well, if you need anything, any time, I'm your man. Can I ask you something? Why are you wearin' a scarf? - Oh. I hadn't decided which direction to take my hair in. - It's a big decision. - Last on Roots. - I didn't own any slaves. You own any slaves? Conscience clear. - Don't have no knowledge of him as a man. Determine he's no better than the mule. - When the Master gives you somethin', you take it. He gave you a name. I want to hear you say it. Your name is Toby. What's your name? - Kunta. Kunta Kinte. - What's your name? - Toby. My name is Toby. - That's a good nigger. - Ms. Hattie? Were you a slave. - No baby, but my grandmother Shorty was. She belonged to Herbert Woods over in Shelton. - Psst, Pearl. Break is over. We got work to do. Picture frame? Booster seat? Trash sure idn't what it used to be. - What you complainin' about? You ever been shackled in chains? - Jesus Pearl. You mad about somethin'? - Oh let's see. Why would I be mad? Maybe it's 'cuz you crossed over the Atlantic on the Mayflower and not down below on a slave ship, livin' a life of privilege. - Privilege? Oh boy, now I've heard it all. I'm like that Just Hang in There poster with the little kitten hangin' from a tree branch. - Oh please. All white folk is privileged. You folk think things has changed for us? We still livin' in shacks. Half starve to death, slavin' over push-broom jobs ain't none of y'all white folk want. My friend that cat has got it good. - Do you think I'm a racist like Shirley? - And half this cornball town. No. - Then why are we fightin'? Memaw used to say, "Success is a house a man built "out of the rocks that other people throw at him." - Who in the hell builds a house out of rocks? - That's the part I could never figure out. Pearl, I think you're probably my best friend. - Ditto. Give me some skin. Damn. Peanut gallery needs to calm down. - OK. But we got a shop to decorate. Shine your light right there. Watch, they're gonna arrest me, I just know it. - Stop persecutin' yourself. And Shirley doesn't have any supporting documents. Aerial photos. The judge will refuse an arrest if the offense is civil in nature and the statute does not constitute a crime, therefore, the case would be expunged, i.e., erased. - Are you makin' this up? - Mm-mm-uh. - Let me get this straight. You took her chair, and then she came and took back her chair, and now you want me to... - Arrest her. - Be reasonable angel. I am the law, but I'm not above it. - Since when? Come on now. You're not afraid of a little competition now are you? 'Cause we all know, it ain't the chair. Just who does the pumpin'. - Gosh I wish Memaw was here to see this. - Fluff them flowers. And light Memaw's candle. Stack them towels over by the slop sink. This is our chance to cultivate somethin', harness our dreams, become somebody. - How much time we got to do all that. - A count of three. One. Two. Ready? ♪ And sugar to make it sweet ♪ ♪ No ifs and buts about it ♪ - Wait. Could you teach me how to do black hair? - I can teach you corn rowin' and plaitin', but I don't know a single, black sista who's gonna let a snowball do her hair. Man. - You won't believe what she tried to tell me this time. - Ladies, step right up to the beauty chair where anything is possible. Who's first? - Ohhh. - Line up. Line up. - Run a hot comb through my wig-hat baby. Get the kinks out and just dress it up a little bit for me. But Pearl be careful. The last time you burned a chink in my bang and this stuff ain't grass. - Well, now that you payin', I was thinkin' maybe we might go in another direction. Find somethin' different, but it all cost the same, $4.50. - Well, well wait a minute. You gonna charge me to run a hot comb through my wig when you been doin' it all these years for free? - Well yes, see we payin' rent now, but imagine all the possibilities of your real hair. - Wait, what kind of hell bullstuff is this? That's my day's wage. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. OK, $3.50? $2.50? A buck-fifty and a lollipop? - What flavor? - Ladies, ladies, bid adieu to your wiglets, throw that honkey hair in the trash, and for a buck-fifty and a lollipop, you can return to your roots. - Roots? What roots? What the hell is she talk 'bout? - Say hello to the Aretha Franklin. To the Miles Davis. To the Stevie Wonder of hair. - I just remembered I was double parked. - Wait, you ain't gotta car. - That child's as white as Pat Boone's shoes. - So, we's in changin' times. - Ain't no sister gonna let a white girl touch her hair. What kind of relaxer you been sniffin'? - But you see what she does? The girl is gifted. - Not with this hair she ain't. - Well here's the news bulletin. Your head is covered by a wig that shines like plastic. Now, you ladies ever thought about keepin' your hair natural? Like Marvin Gaye say, "Ain't nothin' like the real thing, baby." - Real? I got to survive. In this white man's town. Now that's the real thing, baby. - Well fine then. Next. And the chair waits. - Pearl I thought it was real beautiful what you said about me and Aretha Franklin... - Oh shut up Styrofoam peanut. This might be the stupidest thing I ever done. - Pearl? Pearl? Are you insinuatin' this is my fault? - Insinuatin"? Hell, I told you this wouldn't work. - You don't think I'm hurtin' here? You don't think I'm scared? I'm livin' off mustard sandwiches without the bread! - Oh cry me a river. Did Kunta Kinte complain when they stole him from his mama? When they stripped him? Threw him in that germ infested ship? Did he get on the pity pot? Ohhh, to have your problems. - Pearl? - Don't call me Pearl no 'mo. Pearl my slave name. I'm changin' my name to Babatunde. - Sorry. - Don't worry. I only saw everything. That one's a beaut. - Yep. That's the Sydney Harbour. It's the world's tallest steel arc bridge. Six million hand-driven rivets. - What's that one? - That's the Longfellow in Boston. It's got these pylons made of granite in the belt courses that will make you spontaneously weep. I would love to build a really, really important bridge like that one there. Mine are more functionary. - What about that one? - That's a bridge we blew up in 'Nam. We cut off access to an entire village. You know I've been doing all the gabbing. What about you? Why do you fix hair? - I see hairdos in my head. I look at someone and I just see inside their skin, what hairdo would suit 'em. It's weird. - Hey, weird's good. What do you see when you look at me? - I think I would layer the top. And long, loose sweeps. Nothin' in place. - I like that. Keep goin'. - I would cut so it'd taper just a little above. How come you never put down roots? - Well I found the road suits me. I don't have to belong, you know. I just like to keep it loose. - No moss on you. - Hey, you wanna make a bet? You make rent, I get to take that scarf off your hair. What's wrong? - Only everything. Rent's due in three days. And Pearl's yellin' at me. And Shirley's poisonin' the town with her racist brainwashin', and I'm too white for the blacks and I'm too black for the whites, and sometimes I feel like I'm just gonna pckoww! - Hey. - You know? - You and Pearl, you're gutsy, you're brave. - Or stupid. - In the words of the great prophet Captain Kirk, you're boldly going where no man has gone before. No woman either. It's awesome. You guys are shakin' things up. - When are you leavin'? - Um... - Tomorrow? Next week? Next year? - Soon as the last pylon's in, about three days. - Can't stay on a while longer? - I got offered a bridge in Jersey. That's a big step forward. - Good for you. I should a... - Hey, where you goin'? - I should be quarantined. - Why? - I got a leavin' disease. - A leaving disease? - Yeah. So... Just gonna go. - You ain't heard? People say the police is lookin' for the colored men. Everybody know that. The description says... - You're not gonna leave me, are you? - Leave you? What you talkin' 'bout? - Just that I keep tryin' not to care when people leave. You're lucky. You got a family. - Yeah, they alright. - Bud's leavin' soon. - Hmmh, well I would be too if I still had my Negro college fund. I'm stuck in this bassackwards town, and these tigers ain't changin' their stripes. - Then what are we gonna do to make rent? We could give up. Ask Shirley to take us back. - Oh, Lord. I ain't gonna be no washer. That ain't no life. - Maybe now would be a good time for the hug department to open? - No I don't like hugs. - Come on, we'll feel better. - No, I don't like hugs. Ooh, ooh. Hey! - Violet? - Take your hands off her. You hear what I, I said get your hands off her. - What in Hellmann's Mayonnaise, grandma? Your arteries gone hard? It's Violet. - This old pole cat stole your Ironside money. - No, grandma. She ain't no pole cat. She's my partner. She come over to watch Roots. Her TV on the blink. I told her it'd be alright. - Good evening, Ms. Hattie. I'm whitelet. Violet. Be happy to fit you in at the Salt and Pepper any time. - Why would I want to spend money to get my hair did when I can wear a wig? - You sure got yourself a deal. - You be quiet. - Come on. They ain't gonna throw watermelons at you. - No, no. Mama! No, no, no, mama. Mama! Mama! - Where you goin'? - Leave me. - Grandma? Where you goin'? - I said leave me be. - Hattie? - What you doin' grandma? Grandma, please. Just talk to me. Grandma, where you goin'? Grandma, don't you let the devil taunt you. - All my life I been ashamed of my kinky hair and black skin. I'm tired of hidin' my light under a bushel basket. I want to celebrate my roots. Not hide 'em. - Well I think I got just what the doctor ordered. - You doin' me right? Not her. - What happened to all that bushel basket talk? Now didn't you say you wanted to celebrate your roots, not hide from 'em? - Yes I did. But did I say that I was ready for a white woman to do my hair? Not while these four eyes can see. Nigger move. I can't see. - No, this way it'll be more of a surprise. Now, how many fingers I got up? - Five? - Cool. Let's get started. - My God. You snuck one in on me. Shame on you. But damn I look good. I'm gonna tell all my neighbors. This floor is gonna be stomped. Thank you baby. And you, thank you. - Oh. - What? - I can't pay you with no money. But these are a reminder of what our people made out of this land. Day after day in the scorchin' sun. They would pick somethin' so simple and make a meal. Grab your coats. - Why Ms. Hattie? - We gonna have us a hair parade. Throw back, head up. Ain't nobody lookin' at us. - No ma'am. - Let's try it again. Only this time, let's jive ass walk right down the middle of the street. - What's a jive ass walk? - Oh. - Show her grandma. - Alright, you gotta take in the world like you own it. Alright? Take it in. Take in the world like you own it. - Yes ma'am. Get it. Uh oh, uh oh. Get up, show she's best. What's that? - It's a jive ass. - That ain't no jive ass walk. Notch up your attitude. Do it again. - Yes ma'am. - Violet, what are y'all doin'? - We're havin' us a parade. - What kind of parade? - A hair parade. - Where's your wig, Hattie? - My wig in the river. Does honkey hair sink? - Hattie, remember your place. - Mabel, I'm in my place. ♪ Since you've been gone ♪ ♪ I've been running around ♪ ♪ I have'nt done nothing babe ♪ ♪ except going to town ♪ ♪ True love and affection ♪ ♪ put brand new life in me ♪ ♪ Take me baby ♪ ♪ and stop this mysery ♪ ♪ Why don't you take me baby ♪ ♪ Take me baby ♪ ♪ Take me Hallelujah ♪ ♪ For writing your prediction ♪ ♪ The only thing thats close to your love ♪ ♪ is fantasy and pitching ♪ ♪ Take me in your arms ♪ ♪ surround me with your love ♪ ♪ if you do ♪ ♪ you know I thank the stars above ♪ ♪ Why don't you take ma baby ♪ ♪ Take me baby ♪ - Well, we made a fortune in collards.

They're all a little blacker now. - I wasn't worried for one second. - You gonna show me a little gratitude? - Well alright, but just my hand. - Ooh. - Wait. - Thank you. - Can I see you before I go? - No. It could've been you and me. But you're not gonna see this hand until you rectify your mistake. - Oh honey. Come on baby. - Oh yeah, right there, right there. Ooh. - Hmmh. - Who would want this hole? This property was condemned before we got here. Who is offerin' you more money? - I'm not at liberty to say. - It's Shirley. - What's happenin'? - Shirley made Smilie an offer to rent this hole for $75 startin' on Tuesday. They tryin' to undercut us. - You only paid for five days. - We have to come up with $75? - Yes. It's a total scam. - I'm sorry sweetness. i thought it'd be romantic to have the top down. Didn't think. Worked fine 'til Slidell. - I'll be right there. - Where's the girl? Thank you. - Pray for a miracle and here she comes. Ooh, money bags is here. Look, get out here. Get ready to do your magic. - Welcome back. - Hi, Fuzzy got the top stuck down. I have seen more hail than Satan and more rain than Noah. You gotta squeeze me in while he's fixin' the top. - Since you lookin' to get the works done on your hair, 75 ain't too much? - You want to charge me what? - 75. - No, uh-uh. I would never pay that. - Well alright, that's fine. You wanna walk around this town lookin' like a snow monkey. It's your life. - Oh for cryin' out loud. How's 70? - Plus tip? - Don't push it. - Out of the way, folks. Payin' customer comin' through. - My shoes are dirty, I'm gonna just wait out on the doorstep. Why don't you just fix my hair at my house? I've got the cutest little pink sink and salad sprayer. - We got a wash sink. - Yes. But, there's black people in there. So? - So, those scissors have touched a black person's hair. That comb has touched a black person's hair. - Oh. Excuse us. - What's she got against black folk? - What are we gonna do? I'm scared. You got any other job possibilities 'cause we're gonna lose the shop? - That ignoramus needs to march her troll ass in here just like everybody else, and stop insultin' the air with her racist mouthin'. - I apologize. But you need to march your troll ass in here like everybody else and stop mouthin' the air with your racist insultin'. Her words, not mine. - Shit. It was so much easier before we mixed. - Tell that banana eater fine, she can stay right where she is. The choice is hers. - For cryin' out loud, I'm offerin' you good money. - Not if she was handin' out million dollar bills. - Get off it. She ain't gonna budge. - If you want to go changin' things, why don't you run for public office? This is a durn beauty parlor for cripes sake. We gotta save this place. - Fine. You live by your code of ethics. And I'll live by mine. - Pearl? If you want me to do your hair, I'll do it. In our shop with the same scissors and the same comb as everybody else, and that is the way it has to be. - Oh yeah? Well, up yours. Up yours. - Did the right thang. Business ain't worth throwin' out your principles. - Yep, guess this is it. This is the end. - Yeah. - Anybody want any magazines? Collard greens? - Just sneaking in the back. Then nobody'll see me... - No, no, you've gotta come in the same door as everybody else. That's just the way it has to be. - Jesus, I hope you're happy. - I'd be happy if you pay up front. - You go girl. Yes Lord, Amen. - I feel the spirit. It's like bein' in church. - Y'all catch the spirit in white folk church? - By ladies. Soak it in. I'm the Rosa Parks of Whynot. - I thought you only reserved the casket spray for dead people. - Huh? That's what you wanted? Well, I could do that in five minutes. - Do it. Do it right now. - Right now? Why I can't right now. I've got an appointment. - Violet might could fit you in. In a month. - We did it. We did it. - Oh for once I feel like I'm somebody, like my family's somebody, like my people is somebody. - I'm a hair stylist. I am a beauty professional! - And now, the dramatic conclusion of Roots. - Tom Harvey! Get yourself out here boy or we're gonna burn your kinfolk. - The first slave in this family was my granddaddy, Kunta Kinte. 'Fore he was a slave, he was a free man in another country, Africa. And then the slavers, they catch him. And they brung him to America. But Kunta Kinte, he never forget where he come from. And 'fore he die, he'd give that dream of freedom to his daughter, Kizzy, my mama, and 'fore she died, she gave that dream to me. - Hear me ol' African. We is free! - We are free. And ain't nobody or nothin' gonna keep us down. - Goodnight. - What happened to that bet we had? - I can't take off my scarf. And I'd have to do my hair. - You're kidding me, right? - I know I got all these exotic and sexy hairdos for everyone else, but when it comes to me, I'm just not fully formed. - Violet, you're an original. You shouldn't cover that up. - Let me do you first. ♪ until you come around again ♪ ♪ and make my heart go crazy ♪ ♪ Touch me once more ♪ ♪ like you did before ♪ ♪ all the pain just melts away ♪ ♪ You make my life worth living ♪ ♪ when you look at...♪ - You feelin' OK? - Yeah. You? - I feel, I don't even know if there's a word for it. - Weird? - No. - Stomach bile in your throat? - No. I feel like... - Open up in there. - Oh my gosh. We gotta get your stuff. We gotta get you out the back. - Why? What are you ashamed to be seen with me? - Sorry, you don't know this town. People talk. - Well, who gives a flyin' flip what these people say? You know, you could lose a lot of your life answering to that. - Lord, I have seen it all. - She put the "b" in brazen. - What's all this? - You heard about the vandalism? - Vandalism? - Somebody got a wild hair and painted Jesus chocolate brown. Pearl here? I need to have a word with her. - Pearl, what, no. What makes y'all think Pearl had anything to do with this? - You heard her runnin' her mouth. Jesus was not a Negro. And there's not a thing Pearl can do about that. - Pearl didn't touch Jesus. - Hush up. This whole cockamamie mess is all your fault. - My fault? - Encouragin' the coloreds, gettin' them all riled up with those hairdos. - You can't treat coloreds that way, Violet. Makin' 'em think they're better than they are. - They got rights. Just like you. - Gonna have rights when their men rob you? - What? - When they rape you. - That's prejudice. - Who's she callin' prejudice with her mad dog bangs? - You don't own Jesus and you don't own me. - Did I say that I owned you? That's the reason you people can't get ahead. You're stuck in the past. - I'm stuck? That's what you say. I'm stuck. - You don't like the way it is around here? Go on back to Africa. - Alright, that's enough. Let's break up this little prayer meeting... - You better stop waving your finger. I said cracker jack, you better stop waving your finger. - Don't you threaten me. I'll put finger where I please. You are not in charge of my finger. - Now you listen to me. You skinny little toothpick body with your Q-tip hair. Slavery is over. Jesus was beggin' me to paint him brown! - That's it Pearl. You under arrest for vandalism. - What? - Come on, let's go. - This is a miscarriage of justice. Article 19. You better wait to hear what Jimmy Carter has to say about this. Violet, get me Jimmy Carter's phone number. - She didn't do it, I did! - What? - You heard me. - Well then I'll arrest you both. - Violet and Pearl did no such thang. I did it. - Ms. Hattie, why you lyin'? Sheriff, I'm your man. - Do you believe this crock? All of 'em lyin' bastards. - What? - Lyin'? I saw you and Sheriff Raybur pressed together like rye bread and ham. - OK everybody, get on home before somebody gets hurt. - Yeah you. - You little Judas. - Ahhhh! What I say? Stop it with that flick... What did I? Don't put that finger in my face. - My doctor says I cannot get upset like this. - Shit. - Get her Shirley, get her! Get her! Get her, Shirley! - Somebody call the fire department. - Get the cash. Where's the cash box? - Alright, alright. It's time to go. - My chair. - God bless America. Crazy headed fool, this is all my fault. - This town was far too dull. Gave us somethin' to talk about. - Don't try. I gotta get as far away from this place as I can get. - You can't quit. - Somethin's changed inside me. Kunta, Kizzy, Chicken George. They are passin' on a torch, and I gotta answer the call. - What are you talkin' about a call? This is our call. We can rebuild our dream. - No, Violet. This shop, that's your dream. You gotta see that dream through. My dream is country where Jesus ain't got no color. Where a wash woman is valued just as much as the rich lady customer. And where the President of the United States could be a black woman. That's my dream. Might of got a little carried away on that last bit. - Wait, back up. I don't understand. - Instead of knockin' my head in Whynot, I'm gonna thumb my way to Washington, and knock me down some doors. They got plenty of colleges. Set up a wash pot. Put myself through school. Keep this. To quote my man Marshall, "Sometimes history takes things into his own hands." I want you to know that you askin' me to be a partner with you, that meant the world to me. Say something. Tell me you ain't mad. You know me and you, we did good. Hey. - No it isn't? - Sweet Jesus. - It can't be. Take it. - No. - Take it with you. - But this is all the money you got. - It was your money too. Besides, get you started on your law books. - Let's get outta here. We can just go. - Stop! That thing you did for Clara. You can do that for me? - Ms. Shirley's open tomorrow. - She can't do what you do. - I'm real sorry. My shop is gone. There's nothin' left. I'm done. - You still have your chair. Bloom where planted. - My gosh. Memaw used to say that. OK. One last haircut. - Violet, hold up. Do me, do me. - Wait a minute. I need a touch up. - Violet, can you give me a fro like Hattie? - Flush that idea outta your head, 'cuz I'm one of a kind, hon. I'm one of a kind. I got the only fro, don't you understand? - Ms. Rosadel, what happened? ♪ It s a beautiful day ♪ ♪ I got my fire♪ ♪ got my reason to be♪ ♪ its been burning for a long time ♪ ♪ aint nothing gonna stop me now you know ♪ ♪ now you know ♪ ♪ cant walk away ♪ ♪ cant give up now ♪ ♪ just getting started things about to change ♪ ♪ Listen ♪ ♪ Listen to the beat that is your heart ♪ ♪ It s calling you It ll never go away ♪ ♪ Listen ♪ ♪ Listen to the song that s in your heart ♪ ♪ it wont lie to you loves here to stay ♪ ♪ It s a beautiful day ♪ ♪ I got my truth ♪ ♪ and you cant take that away ♪ ♪ deny your own ♪ ♪ but mine is real ♪
