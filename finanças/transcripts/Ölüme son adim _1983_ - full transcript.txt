Last Step To Death Let's drink. My fortune is yours. Whatever you want. You want a car? A mansion? I'll buy you whatever you want. How did you get in here? This is my job. I delivered your company's merchandise. Why would someone like you carry such a simple thing? You call it simple, but there was heroin inside. Bad things happened. The girl who used it died before my very eyes. They were already destined to die. And so are you. Your turn. I can't! You will swallow the whole thing right in front of me. I can't! You will. The heroin wasn't pure. Now eat it up! Your forehead is next. I said your forehead is next. That poor girl also begged to be saved. This is gonna be painful. The pain will be like hell. I beg you, save me. If they hear about this, they won't let you live! They won't! They'll kill you. We'll see. They'll kill you! This room's empty, man. We came here for nothing. There's no one here. You know this job well. I can't find anyone better than you. You've proven to me once again that you'll be useful. That depends on the job. Let's talk. They grabbed the best man we had. We wanted to find a new medicine for leukemia. 10 years in the making. Millions were spent for this. You understand? Millions! We'd found the solution. Think of the millions of sick patients who would have recovered if the medicine hit the market. We're running a big establishment here. If we take into account the damage that losing this job will do to us, our commercial prestige will suddenly drop to zero. This will turn our business into a mess. I'm telling you everything outright. You know how much of a trustworthy man I am in this country. I've always worked openly and honestly. Why didn't you call the police? We deal with these sorts of things between ourselves. If word got out to the press, we'd be ruined. What do you want from me? I want you to find the professor and bring him here. I'll give you 100 million for this. Half now. Half when the job's done. So the job's that big? We wouldn't want you if it wasn't. The job benefits the public as well. Jobs that start out for the public's benefit, end up being something else entirely. You bastard. You deceitful rapist, you. What do you want? My daughter's honor for your life! This gun doesn't work sometimes. And you never know when it's gonna blow. Dammit. It'll definitely fire on the third try. You don't look like a bad guy. It's gonna be a shame. But whatever. I'll send lovely flowers to your funeral. This gun is as old as I am. But now, for sure, it'll fire. You crook, you! You lousy friend, you! You're on form like a mule, as usual. You're not too bad yourself. Just as good as me. You tired me. I'll need a drink before I can feel any better. So tell me. You're a good tactician. If you haven't lost your tactical skills from going around with girls all the time we'll handle this job too. Now we'll make the plan. We'll kidnap the man quietly and bring him in. Say we kidnap him. Then what? You're an old friend. You'll help me. You're not fooling a kid, here. Alright, I can give you a little. For example? A couple million. Not worth it. I said millions. Millions, huh? I'll go through hell for you, buddy! It could be dangerous. We could die. I have a favor to ask. Anything. Don't cry if I die. And if I die don't come to my grave. I don't want you to. Come on, baby. Come on. Drink up. Come on! Drink! Come on! You can do it! Faster! Another one! Good job, girl! Let's see the money, gentlemen. Who else wants to bet? Come on! You show him! Just a little bit more left! Come on, girl. Hang in there, or the money's gone. Finish it. Finish it! Give us the money! It's nice to see you, baby. I see you're in good shape. I've been working out. Yeah. In bed! What? He's been getting his exercise in bed. You're the lousiest friend ever. Don't, man. Don't hit me! You're not talking behind my back, are you? We're debating whether or not you're any use around here. Oh really? You've infected the girl with your evil ways. Don't worry about it. Have fun! I told her you like working out in bed. Ohhhh. You're still in great shape. I owe it to alcohol. But I'm tired of all this now. If you're tired of all this, then your new job is ready. Like the old days? More exciting. Cause the money's more. We'll spread out in the dark. We'll either face a fake target, or the real one. Who's the real target? You, me, him, her. It'll take one tenth of a second for us to shoot ourselves or the fake target. How wonderful! Let's not undermine the enemy. There might be moments where we might need to decide as fast as lightning to die or to kill. Don't be scared. If you die, I'll tell your girlfriends that you died a true hero. But it'll be a huge loss for the world. So joking and all, we're going to die, huh? Not bad at all. Let's do this! I think you owe me your life. Sometimes you're a good friend. If this girl keeps hanging around me like this I won't be able to see the target. I'll bet you. For what? That you'll miss the target. Heads or tails? Heads. Tails. You lose. You bastards. I'm not playing heads or tails with you again. The one who hits the wrong target, carries the wrong target. The place we're going to raid is in a valley. I believe it's pretty secure. We'll be quick and surprise them. Does it hurt? Like you wouldn't believe! We're going to rescue a professor there. And then And then, right here we'll wait here. They're going to pick us up in a car. And after the job is done, 25 million each. That's good money. But there's a slight problem. If one of us dies, his or her money will be split equally amongst the rest. You're the worst crook I've ever met! It's the truth. Both lousy, and a crook. Alright, come on. We're hitting the road tomorrow. You act like you're the boss. Heads or tails? Whoever wins is the boss. Heads. Tails. I'm the boss. This is a serious job. I'll shoot anyone who disobeys me. Your mansion, pool and girls will be history. Why aren't you counting me in? Uhhhh. Don't do that. Don't fool around. There's a muslim town back here. Change gears. Oh man. Umm. Well... Cause you're a woman. Oh really? Is that so? Let's give her a chance to speak. I'll have to. Why's that? He's incredibly afraid of car accidents. With an amateur driver, of course I'll be afraid. Oh yeah? But the boss isn't afraid. Why's he any different than me? Cause the boss is good enough not to shoot his friend in the ass! I've spent my whole life in the driver's seat. I'm a 6 time champion of the Turkey rally. Look at the rally champion now. Just great. You keep laughing. I can take care of my own mess. Keep pushing. Let's see if you know how to push. Not that way... oh! Watch yourself. You'll fall. But it looks good when you do. You want us to help? No. This isn't my job. Heads or tails? Heads. You lose. You always win at heads or tails. Luck, my boy. Yeah, I got luck here myself. Get over here and help me push. It's not good when you do it alone. After this, we walk. The real job starts after the hill. You are the smartest man in the world. I, um... No, I know. You're going to say that you are. But you do have one fault. And people with faults don't live very long. Just get to the point already! The point is this: If you light a fire, you'll be inviting over the enemy. You have a suspicion. Tell me the truth. I have this weird feeling. I sense danger. That's your unbeatable fighter sense. Let's say that for now. I'm going to bed. I'm tired. At this hour? I'm not a bum like you two. I'm a woman with an organized lifestyle. I sleep at an exact hour. Call me if you get cold. I've slept with both of you so many times. In blood and pain. Is the danger big? You said that we lived in blood and death. At this point, death is our friend. I'm taking over. You can sleep. Come on. Come on. Let's go get some food. Smart men. There's an opening between us and the target. We can't get past it without being seen. There's an answer for everything. You're too optimistic! You distract the men at the cafeteria. It's the perfect time to show yourself. Wanna bet? On what? The girl's short shorts won't be of any use. This time you're gonna lose. Get up or I'll shoot! Over there. She escaped, dammit! We let her go! Stop! Or I'll shoot. Get in there. Stay where you are! Your short shorts didn't work, did they? If you hadn't exploded a bomb, they would have! This guy sure loves the water. Maybe he escaped. You're seriously a lousy friend. Dip him in one more time. Boss, you wanna bet? On? He'll talk. You're really a genius. I know. You're going to say you are. Is he moving? Nope. Get him out. Let's take a look. You're going in one last time and you won't be coming out. No! Don't do it! I'll tell you where the professor is! He's underground. In the cellar! You're a very smart kid. Isn't he? Oh yeah. Really smart. Mr. Professor. My friend Saban and his wife. And I'm Kagan. We've come to take you. What if I don't go? Now look here, Mr. Professor. We're taking you whether you like it or not. Come on. If you want we can go take a stroll. You want any help? They're coming! They'll be here! They're going to kill us all! You're wasting time! Pull yourself together, man! So tell us, tactical master. What are we gonna do? You tell me. You're the boss. First, we'll take their radio. No one will escape this hell. We're going to capture the professor's kidnappers. I'm waiting for your orders, sir. Look, buddy. When you start out friendly, it means that you want something. I'm not a phoney bum like you. Since this job's tactical aspect is mine, I got a suggestion. Tell me. It's a mistake being together. You and the professor go a seperate way. And I'll go to the center the other way with the girls. This way we won't be in danger at the same time. So? What do you say? Smart offer. It's better to be apart. I'll go with the professor. And you'll take the back with the girls. Okay? You're truly a lousy friend. You lost the bet, right? How'd you know? You were the same when you were a kid. I wanted to be famous when I was a kid. You're a celebrity nevertheless. Twice even. At being a crook and at scoring ladies. These cigarettes are slowly losing their taste. But I'll smoke 'em anyway. Come on, girls. Let's go. Whoa there! What are you staring at? I know exactly what I'm staring at. You look around. Can we talk? That's why we're alone, right? I knew it. You're a smart man. Smart men should make money. Let me go and I'll pay you 10 times as much as what they're paying. Look, Mr. Professor. Do you accept my offer? 100 million for you. I'm a stupid man. That's why I've never had a dime in my life. Plus, I like you a lot. Now move. This way, ladies. Watch it! You might fall! You're in good hands. Let's go. Come on. Hey! What's going on? Hey! I'm talking to you. What are you doing? Oh nothing. We're just walking like a nice family. What's wrong with that? Don't worry about her, dear. Come on, let's keep walking. Don't let anyone near before I get back. Anything happens, give me a call. And you, search the whole forest and catch them! Hands in the air! Oh. It was you. Next time, I'm gonna shoot. It looks quiet. That means they don't know. I hope so. Leyla, you stay with them. Come on. We'll attack from both sides. So there was an alarm system that was informing this place. Now what? Two automatics. We know where they are. One of us will charge over there, and the other will cover. Who's going? Heads or tails? Tails. I lost. I'll go. Can I ask a favor? Go ahead. Please don't shoot me. I would have loved to, but now is not the time. Thank you so much. You're too kind. Indeed I am. You're so stupid. I didn't want to leave you alone. You're worth 25 million for me. Eagle 1 to Eagle 2. We're waiting at the spot we decided. The job's done. Kagan has the merchandise. What happened? It's done. They'll meet us at the spot and take the professor. I'm glad we have a deal. 200 million. We're not two enemies anymore, but two friends. If you've made a deal, what's going to happen to the people who rescued the professor? This is a business. It's always important to win. Money is always worth more than the human life. Now they are worthless to me. They must die! They're coming. The money's coming. Mansions, pools, girls. A wonderful life is coming. A fortune's coming! Let's get outta here! What do you say to this? They almost had us. You got that right. They want us dead. Then the job is big. It'll get even bigger. Because they betrayed us. This man can't walk. We'll carry him. How? Flip for it. Heads. Tails. You lose. If I win at heads or tails one day, you know what I'll do? No, I don't. Now carry him. Just my luck. If only the girl had been shot. I'd be carrying her. You son of a gun. I bet you're in a good mood. Look If we ever reach town you won't tell anybody I carried you on my back, okay? You got that, professor? I'm not a mule. We'll rest here. There's no way they're crossing this bridge. Cut them off from the other side. And keep your eyes open! Don't miss them! You got it? You're very kind. Now that we can't go back, we've got hard days ahead. We need to take it easy with our supplies. They know this place better than us. They've got the upper hand. They double crossed us. I'll forgive anything, but I won't forgive betrayal. Come on. Let's go. Where? Wait, don't tell me. To the bus stop, right? You're a genius. They thought we were going to the bridge. We're going to fool them. We're going down. We got them in the cave! Let's kill them all! I hear noises. Be careful. Move! We're moving down. Wanna flip for it? No need. I'm gonna lose anyway. I'll go down. You're so smart. And you're a phoney friend. Come on. Come on. Be careful. We can't get very far with this man on our hands. We need him. He knows the truth. Or he wouldn't have cost 100 million. This man's life is very important. Everyone must decide. You're the boss. Maybe you should say something nice to uplift us. We've lived like bums all our lives. Never thought of anyone else but ourselves. Good for nothing. We have this opportunity to prove that we are guys, that we are men and that we're useful. Let's fight. Bum fighters, huh? I'm in. I'll take the eye out of whoever doesn't want me. And for me? I'm going to die too. No present for me? Use it wisely. We're almost all out. You really are a lousy friend. A cigarette for a death. You failed! You couldn't kill them! They'll die. They'll all die! You like that guy a lot? I owe him my life. And I'll owe him my death if things keep going the way they are. Boss. Your speech was so noble I had tears in my eyes. If only I could talk like that to a woman. What would happen then? I'd make her kneel down in front of me. You still haven't? No, boss. I couldn't. Teach me some polished words so I can bring that mare to her knees. - When the time is right. - When the time is right, huh? - Think we'll get by? - Yeah, we'll get by. The wound suits you. Doesn't look bad on you either. We're running out of ammo. We'll collect the ammo off the dead and wait for dark. You're hurt. Only you can heal her wound. The enemy will recover by morning. Come on, let's get the professor. You won't even thank me. But whatever. Aren't they ever gonna let us go? We've always turned our back on them. Now let's turn our front. I like that. You finally said something right. I'm the boss, aren't I? We're going to fight them chest to chest. You're seriously a lousy friend. Kill them! Move! Get in the car. It won't start! We'll get it going by pushing it down the hill. But we're running out of time. So one of us has to stop these men. - Flip for it. - Good idea! Heads. I lost. I'm going. Both sides of this coin are tails. You're really a phoney friend. You were always conning me, huh? What can I do? You always say heads. You lose this time, buddy. - I'm going after them myself! - No! Ali. Why'd you come back, you dirty liar? If anything happens to you, I wouldn't know how to tell your lovers. Who cares about a bum like me? You really are a bum. But you're also a heroic fighter. Come on! Hurry up! - Jump in, man! - You first! You can't fool me this time. No heads or tails. Let's go! Hurry! Ali! Hurry up! - You're gonna get shot! - What's it to you? Give me your hand. Give it! - Slow the car down! - I can't slow down! It's going downhill! Come on! Push yourself! The brakes don't work! I can't stop! I said slow down! I can't stop! Ali! Ali! Kagan, shoot me! Don't let them get me! Shoot me! Shoot! I've never seen a more crooked and lousy friend in my life! Shoot me! You phoney, shoot me! You won't be fooling me anymore. You can't cheat anymore. You're the biggest bum in the world! Shoot! Goodbye, my lousy friend. Now, I won't ever share my cigarettes with anyone. I'm so glad to see you again. You've accomplished something great. Heads or tails? Heads or tails? I don't understand. What does this mean? It's quite simple. This is a gamble. I don't understand. You win, you live. You lose, you die. The money! Millions! I'll give you millions! I'll give you my fortune! The world wasn't created for money. There are more important things than money. What's more important than money? Friendship. Friendship? Yours or the rest of the world's money won't bring my friend back. Don't I have another way out? No. You said cancer medicine, it turned out to be synthetic heroin. You crossed me. I can't have you destroying the youth with that poison. You have no choice. H h heads! You lost. Did you cheat again? No. I was honest. But I won't gamble ever again. You're the most crooked gambler friend in the world. You're the lousiest friend in the world. Fin. subs by JackBauer send cigars!
