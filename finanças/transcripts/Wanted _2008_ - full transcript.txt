Yeah! First time in your life, Wesley, you're in control. Shoot the target. You're crazy. Welcome to the fraternity. We call this the loom of fate. After today, you will never set foot in here again. Why not? Because you're like an apostle. Your task is not to interpret, but to deliver. Every culture in history has a secret code, one you won't find in traditional texts. A thousand years ago a clan of weathers discovered a mystical language written in the fabric. They called themselves the fraternity. I'll be honest with you, all I see here are threads. Come here. Look there. Do you see that blind thread that missed the weave and lies on top of the others? Like a mistake? No, it's a code. If the vertical thread is on top - it's a one. If it's below - it's a zero. Binary code? What is it say? It's a name. A target. Where that names come from? from out of a necessity, Wesley. Necessity to maintain balance in a world. They are orders and must be executed. entrusted to us, so that we might forge stability of chaos. This one is yours. look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross. You will. In a time. This is your first assignment. The loom provides, I interpret, you deliver. You want me to kill Robert Dean Darden? Not me. Fate. The target will be in the conference room, sitting at the head chair. There are six windows. You will shoot through the fifth. Fifth window. Now. What did he do if he deserved to die? You don't know. I don't know he was bad, I don't know he was evil. I don't know anything about him. We get all orders from the... loom. Fate? and we're suppose to take on faith that what we're doing is right? Killing someone we know nothing about. I don't know if I can do that. About 20 years ago. There was this girl. Her dad was a federal judge. And so she probably had in her mind that she was going to follow in his footsteps. So she's home one Christmas. And her dad is on this big racketeering case. The defendants want to get a softer judge. One they can buy off. So they hire this guy... Max Petridge. Get him to pay her father a visit. And a way he pays people a visit... Is to brake in... And tie up their loved ones. And force them to watch, while he burns his targets alive. And then he takes a wire hanger and twists it around... And brands his initials at each one of them so they will never ever forget. After I was recruited into the fraternity I found out that Max Petridge's is name that come up. Weeks before the federal judge was killed. And that a fraternity member had failed to pull the trigger. We don't know how far the ripples of our decisions go... Kill one, and maybe save a thousand. That's the code of the fraternity. That's what we believe in. And that's why we do it. Cross. Not yet. Your target will be in a black limo. He always travels the same six blocks on Holsten. You have three blocks to kill him. I am sorry. (Barry, Could you feed Anibell?) BARRY! Wesley! Hey, where have you been, I have really missed you, man. Look at the big man! You fucking asshole! What, you don't ... for weeks and stopped to use the bathroom? You are nothing! No, you are less than nothing! You're not even half the man who Barry is! Barry, he pleases me in ways that you've never even heard of! Who the hell is she, Wesley? Your new whore? Is that what it takes now, you're paying for it? Wesley? He is the man. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Go and sit down, I'm gonna find a car. Big night! I've got to get into recovery. Shit! You, fuck! Freeze! Bullet time... What is he doing here? Oh god! Pull him up. A thousand. This bullet... is the first traceable bullet he's ever used. It was made by this man. His name is Pekwarsky. He works out of what is now a monastery of eastern Moravia. This place Is where our fraternity was born. He's taunting me. He's sending me a message. I'm gonna send one back. He's trapping you. Leading you to a place he knows very well. Look, I know this... I... this is what you've trained me for? You can't go alone. I go alone or he doesn't show. He's not stupid. a member of the fraternity is dead because of me. Okay. Go. Thank you. I don't think that's a good idea. Your next assignment. Pekwarsky? Shit. What are you doing here? Lower your gun. You recognize this? I pulled this out of my shoulder. The guy who put it there killed my father. And I know you made it so tell me where it is. I did mold this but I can't be responsible for a people who use them. I don't give a shit. Tell me where he is. Look at my finger. I... can try to arrange a meet. Have you ever thought about doing things differently? What do you mean? I don't know. Being... somebody else... somebody... normal. No. Stay! He's on the train. He's alone. Wesley... Out of the way, out of the way! Wesley... Listen to me. Shut the fuck up! You don't get to talk to me. You don't get to talk to me. Everything they told you was a lie. Shut up, you lying piece of shit, you shut the fuck up! You are my son. What? What did you say to me? Is that true? Yes. Why did you make me do this? Because you are the only person he wouldn't kill. You knew, god damn it! You two the entire time. Well, his name came up. So did yours. I promised to your father I'd bring you back here. What the fuck? He said it was the only way you'd believe. Your father was never more than a camera click way. It is me. He was my father. And I killed him. To your father... protecting you was worth giving up his life. Protect me? He was trying to fucking kill me! No, he wasn't trying to kill you. He was trying to rescue you. When Cross left the Fraternity Sloan hunted you down. Ever since Fox had her teeth in you he's been trying to separate you from them. Your father never wanted you in the Fraternity, Wesley. He wanted a different path for you. With things that he could never have. A home, peace. No. He hoped you would find your own way. Your father got hold of this. Decipher it yourself. Sloan began manufacturing targets on his own for profit years ago. Your father found out all about it. And he was going to do something about it on his own, right? But Sloan turned everyone against him. My father's name never in came up, did it? No. Holding onto the code made him a target. Yes. You want me to run? No. I want you to live. You can have a different life, Wesley. Like your father wanted for you. We trained him well. My father was wrong about one thing. Everything they told me wasn't a lie. they taught me how to kill, how to feel no pain... And most important lead that every job has a perfect weapon. Well, I am the perfect weapon. I'm supposed to run? No, I've been doing that my entire life. So I say no. I say kill them all and let fate sort out the mess. Kill him. Pussy. Pussy. (whisper) pussy pussy pussy Sloan! Hey. My father wasn't a traitor. This is a kill order. This got Sloan's name on it. What did you say to me? It's a name. It's a... It's a target. I don't want this person dead. Fate does. Fate wanted you dead. And he couldn't take it. So he started manufacturing his own targets. For his own gains. And that's my dad found that. And decided to stand against him. And that's when you sent a man's son to kill his father. You're not an assassin of fate Sloan. You're just a thug who can bend bullets. Is that true? Here is what the truth is. Your name came up. Your name came up. Your name came up. Your name. Your name. Yours. Everyone in this room. If I had not done what I did, You would all be dead. I saved your lives. Now look where we are. We are stronger than ever. Changing a course of history as we see it. Choosing the targets we select. We can redistribute power as we see fit. The wolves rule. Not the sheep. Now if any of you feel the need to follow the code of the fraternity to the letter. I invite you to take your gun, put it in your mouth, and pull the trigger. That is what Wesley demands. Otherwise. Shoot this motherfucker. and let us take our fraternity of assassins to heights reserved only for the gods of men. You choose. Fuck the code. Sloan! Sloan! Six weeks ago I was ordinary and pathetic. Just like you. who am I now? Account manager? Assassin? Or just another tool, who was mindfucked into killing his father. I am all of these. I am none of these. Who am I now? This is not me, fulfilling my destiny. This is not me, following in my father's footsteps. This is definitely not me saving the world. Still trying to figure out who you are? This is not me. This is just a motherfucking decoy. Oh, fuck. This is me, taking control. From Sloan. From the fraternity. From Janice. From billing reports. From ergonomic keyboards. From cheating girlfriends and sack-a-shit best friends. This is me taking back control of my life. What the fuck have you done lately?
