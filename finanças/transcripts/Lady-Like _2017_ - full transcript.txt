- Fuck! Hmm, watch it! Oh! How many times do I have to tell you this, Mom? I'll call you! Allie? Allie, is that you? Yeah... Okay, so just so you know, I really, really have to... poo. - Bye. Thank you so much for dinner. I hope Allie's doing okay? Ah, you were at dinner for like three hours. And where the fuck were you? I had to tell my parents you were on your period. Ugg! Gross! I overslept. I just laid down for a little nappy nap, and then... I couldn't get my ass out of bed. And then you clearly didn't get ready once you did? Well, you know, I can't get ready without you. So can we... go get ready now? -I'm ready! -Oh I'm sorry, my name's Kort, and I'm so cute. I don't even need to get dressed up to get hit on. Let's have a parade. Bitch! Thanks, that's really sweet of you! Whatever. I'm going to go get started. I might even shave my pussy. Oh, put my name on those left overs because I don't want these sluts eating our shit when we're not here. Why your name? I can be mean. Just put my name on it. These girls know I don't play games. Oh, you mean you're a bitch? Oh, okay! Well, that was kind of... mean! Thanks. So... I'm thinking this is the year I get a boyfriend, You know, I'm sick of blacking out fucking frat guys, It's like, I just want to settle down, you know? I mean, last year I had my slutty sophomore stand, which was fine. I'm not going to judge myself for that. I mean, we all go through our phases. Except for you! But... Whatever, I just feel like... This is my year... you know? Until we go abroad, that is. Well, I don't think you can really plan for that sort of thing. Whatever, dude. I'll... have some flings with some Brits while we're there, and then when I get back... We'll date! Then he'll propose shortly after graduation, and then... Move to Silver Springs. He'll get a six figure job working for an embassy and... That will be that! Or you can get a six figure job. Okay, whatever. How do I look? You look hot! Really? Yeah, seriously you look good. I don't know... I just hope I look fuckable. Yeah, I don't know, I was walking from campus today, and I just kept finding these feathers. Feather, after feather, after feather... Feathers? Yeah, it's a Native American thing. Alright, so the guys say to get there at ten, and bring some money for the keg. Are you sure? Whatever, I'm sure he was just like suggesting it. Don't defend him because you used to blow him. Okay, it's not like I sucked the life out of him. -I only did it once! Can you please pour me more of that wine? Oh, sure thing. Thanks again for the wine, Kort. Anything for you, Mary. Don't thank her, her parents bought it. Anyway... You serious, you don't want to come out now? I don't know. My stomach's kind of bothering me. - Really? -Yeah! Who do you say is going to be there? Will you just shut up and get drunk with me? Please don't leave me with them. -Okay, I get it. I'm your rock. - You are. Fuck it! Are you two just going to sit in there and scissor all night, or come fucking party with us? Go, go, go! There we go, girl! Yes! Hey, hey, now come on! Hey, dude, is that the way I do that for you? Shall we go get? Yeah! Let's go! She's so cool! Okay, wait, how are my boobs? -You look good! - I do? -Yeah. -Do they look big? I want them to look big. -Yes! - They do? Go back to what you were saying. Oh my god! Okay! So, my schedule is the shit. No classes on Friday, like ever. No classes before 1pm, and... two of my classes only meet once a week. It's a fucking joke! Your parents must be really proud. They should be! I'm kind of a genius! Okay, what is this? Yeah, I called this the Ben Affleck, because when you drink it, you're going to be gone girl. Oh Shit! - It's terrible! - What? It's so good. -No, it's not. -Excuse me Kortney... Who is it? I have no idea. Is he hot? He's... Gorgeous! Top ten. -Hey! -Hi. Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude, I just... I thought you were really pretty. I got your name from... a friend. Was that creepy? A little bit. -Okay, can I try again? -Yeah. -I'm Daniel... Can you hurry up? Waste Of time! Seriously, now you want to hang out? Who wants to hang out? Kyle! He doesn't talk to me all night and then suddenly he wants to "watch a movie". I mean, it's-- Ahh... So, what the fuck did you talk about? Um... He said he's new... No shit he's new dude. A hottie like that doesn't just fly under the radar for three years. Jeez! Sorry, go on. Um... He transferred for lacrosse... Ugh, duh! He's going to be a junior in the classroom and a senior on the field. Oh my god, no way! He still has two full seasons left? Yeah, I think he said something about redshirting or-- Oh my god, I don't care about his fucking NCAA eligibility. -Was he hitting on you or not? - I don't know. Dude, shut up. He totally wants to penetrate you. Oh, Gross! - What, you think? -Yeah... Okay. What's his first and last name? -I'm gonna Facebook this bitch. -When did you get this? Oh, I convinced my parents that it would help me do better in school, but I totally just use it to watch porn. You know what I need? I got his first name, Daniel. That's it. They're five fucking Daniels on the lacrosse team. I'm going to need more than that. I think his eyes are blue... His eyes are blue? That's not a Facebook search query! A blue-eyed dude on the lacrosse team, who probably has a big dick. Whore! Jesus! What are you doing? Just a little research. Okay, here's the deal. I talked to the boat shoe crew over there, and they said his last name is McMullen. He's single. Okay. And he transferred here from Maryland. Like I said. He sat out last year because of an injury. -That's what I said. -Okay, who fucking cares! Look at these photos! See this? Beautiful scenery... - Mmm. - See what that is? It's a lake! Do you know what that means? His family has a fucking lake house! I like those shutters. Whatever. You see these two little bitches? - Huh. - Those are his sisters. So? Do you know what that means? What? Okay. Any guy with two sisters or more is twice as nice. It's like a rule of thumb. That's kind of sweet. Okay, what I'm saying is I approve. What, because he has sisters and a lake house? Yeah! And... look at this! I count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, abs! Hello, hello abs. They're so cute! So you like him? I didn't say that. You said that. Kort, if you don't want none of this Nantucket nectar, then move over! 'Cause this girl is parched. Mmm... Okay, I like him. Thank you. It's about time somebody manned up around here. Wait, hold on. If this works out, I'm not saying that it will or won't, I'm saying if... If this works out and you guys settle on four kids even though I'll probably push for five. All right. We're leaving for London in three months and we cannot take a boyfriend with us. I just met the guy. Oh, you just wanna get some of that dick. I respect that. Just think about it. Right now he's down there, just sweating his balls off. Hmm... Lovely! One day you might even get to lick them. Seriously. Pussy. Remember that the United States at the beginning of the 1930s, had not fully asserted itself as a global superpower. It has begun to, when-- Oh, my bad! Let's begin by understanding what bottlenecks truly are. Bottlenecks are, contrary to what you may believe, factory phenomena where the performance... [lecturer continues speaking inaudibly] Generally speaking. Now, for example... Until 1941, and in that period, the US struggled to figure out a way to become involved and insure its place as the Guardian of the western hemisphere, without actually involving troops. Now this process would go on to become known under the rhetorical umbrella of "The Good Neighbor Policy". And one of the ways they did that... ...with the same processing speed of 500 units per second flowing into our input... Even though the United States' popular opinion was actively... The idea of becoming involved -in another... in another world war. They give you two widget line flow systems, where you have two identical widgets with the same processing speed of 500 units per second. So, you see by adding one additional widget maker, we're able to diffuse the bottleneck entirely. And therefore as a whole help facilitate factory and operating at a 50% hype utilization level. Pretty interesting stuff, wouldn't you say? By your blank stare, I would take that as a yes. Moving on. Oh, hey! -Oh, hey. - Hey. Are you in this class? Ah, yeah. I thought... I thought we caught eyes earlier. Oh, really? Sometimes I'm like zoning out and not like seeing what's in front of me, so... And, have you talked to the doctor about this? It's actually, it's funny that we're in the same class, because I was... Well, I was hoping... I don't know, I was wondering if you would be up for-- A date! Yes, you want a date! Who doesn't want dates here? -I know, right? -This guy's a fucking dreamboat! - So, what did you say? I told him... Oh, I told him... I told him, "yeah". What, should I not have said "yeah"? Well, it depends on how you said it. I said it like... Yeah. -Yeah. -No, I didn't say it like that. It was like... more like... Yeah. -Yeah. -Okay, no, this is it: Yeah. Like, you know, I'll do this, potentially... But if I do, I'll be doing you a huge favor. -What do you think? -I think it's... perfect! So, what are you going to wear? I don't know, this. No! -Come on! -What? - We gotta fix this! -Why? You look like a grandma! I look like a grandma? -But you're wearing velvet shoes! -These are very hip... ["Ivy League Circus" by Gordon Voidwell] -Pit stop! -We already ate before class. Who cares, you can throw it up after when you-- -Stephen! -Allie! Hi! Good to see you. Good to see you too. What the fuck was that? You're still talking? I mean, he still texts me. Only after 2 a.m. I think there's something wrong with his plan. Sorry. Can this guy move? Well, when is it? Thank you. God, when's your date? I don't know. He's going to call. What? He's going to call? Not text? Um... yeah. Classy! Oh my god! How's that yoghurt? -Do you want some? - No. Have some. I want it. I'm Kort, I'm skinny, I'm want it. -Stop! - See, you have a little on your face. What do you think about this one? Did somebody die? Um... you if you don't stop talking shit! Dude, you've got to give him more than your knee caps. God! He's better than that dress, okay? He's tall, he's good looking. He's got those beautiful DSL's. DSL's? How does that help me? Depends what you're in to. Look, we've got to go more Beyoncé, less Bea Arthur. I'm going to look like a birthday cake That sounds delicious. Let's go try shit on. ["Classic Girl" by Deidre & The Dark] Do you like? Do I look like Heidi Klum? Oh, okay. So, I'm having mixed feelings about this one. You know, I like it because it's versatile but then again I just really don't know. Walk away, just walk away. You don't like it? Dress it up, dress it down. Like, right now the way I'm wearing it, it's going to look formal and I can just wear it anywhere, right. Like a-- Formal? Like Diane Keaton who's a stripper? Oh, girl, you look fabulous! But I can't have you out here like you're going to a bar, when we know you're trying to go to a party. Then, with just like a slight adjustment... it becomes casual. -Yeah, very casual. -It's like... beachy. There! Babe! -No? -No! Alright, come out. Oh... yes! It's perfect! -You really think it's good? - Yes. Can my cat come to the wedding? Okay, what's the damage? -Oh hell no! -What? It's $500. -No! -Yes! I'm sorry baby, but you're not worth it. We'll figure something out. -So, Mary's top? -Yes, with the pants of yours I like. -Oh, that can work. Perfect! Oh my god, love it! Oh hey, have you all listened to this? -What? -Cereal. The podcast. -Never heard of it. -Okay, well, if you do, don't tell me, I'm pretty sure I can crack this puppy. - Okay. -Alright. I'm sorry. -What's your plan? -Oh... I have a class tonight. -Yeah, interesting! -Dammit! Ok, I'm going to go study... and then... Hey, when you're back do you want to do movie night? If by movie night you mean season three of Downton? What the fuck else would I mean? Right, sorry, mate! -Pip, pip and bollocks. - Okay, I can't, it's terrible. You're ruining it. Hey... Let me know if Dan Dan gives you a ring ring. - Okay. - Bye. ...and with 140 characters, that's how Twitter killed the feature story, which leads me to... ending this class. He still hasn't called? Why is it that whenever I want to do something important the mother-fucking internet... Oh... there it is! Okay, look, like I was thinking, this little pussy boy Daniel better grow a pair and make a fucking phone call. Do you think he's seeing someone else? Maybe he lost his phone. Or... or it broke. That happens! Hey! Do you have some... batteries? For what? For my TV. Remote. No. Maybe he's dead. You know what, dude, fuck this little cocksucker, okay? He said he would call and he hasn't. He's either gay, a commitment-phobe, or dead. Either way, I say we're over him. -Oh my god! Unless that's him... If that's him, I say we're back in. -What do I do? -Answer it! Hello. It's Daniel! -Hey. -What the fuck's he saying? Oh no, it's fine. Ah, ah, ah... That's fine. Uh-hm. Yeah, that works. Okay. I'll see you then. Bye. What the fuck is wrong with you? It's a baby! Isn't it cute? Okay, what did he say? Okay, so first of all he said "Sorry for calling so late". Precious! And then he said he wants to take me out this weekend but he can't because he's going out of town with his family. Lake house! Next weekend, if I'm up for it, he wants to take me to dinner on Friday. What? Nobody even goes out on Fridays! -That's brilliant! -I know. Okay... You tell me what you're thinking, and I'll do the same, okay? Ready? One, two-- -You need to hit the gym! -I hope he takes me to a club-- What? Maybe just a little cardio! You gotta open up your gait, baby girl. What? Your strides, they're tiny! Longer strides, more calories! Stop running like a toddler, start running like a grown human woman who wants to get laid. See that dick! Run to that dick! Faster! Run to it! Kegels, feel the kegels! Pull... inside your vagina. Eye of the tiger, baby, earn it! Squeeze it! Burn! Feel the burn! Harder, Kort! You're not going hard enough! Earn your thigh gap! -What are you doing? -Shut up! -Jesus! -Oh my god! You're doing great, man. Don't let your hips drop. Don't let gravity win like this. I'm not. Don't touch me with your nasty chip fingers! What? I said I see gravity winning and I don't like it. You're disgusting! I don't know if my ass got bigger, or these jeans got smaller. Oh, I washed them like four times. What do you think, Pam? You look amazing! Agreed! I have something for you. -Just in case! ♪ You know you want to ♪ No! -Be safe! - The world is a happy place. Excuse me! No girl gets her door on her own fucking date! - It's my door to get! -Get the door! It's my door! You stay right here! Hello, sweet cheeks. -Hey! Is Kortney here? -Who? I'm just kidding. That little whore's right here. Oh... Hi! Thanks. Your server will be right with you. -Enjoy your meal. -Thank you. This place is really nice! I guess I always sort of thought that first dates should be... special. You know, just in case. Yeah. Ah, yeah. Is Luce here? She's upstairs. Martins? He took you to mother-fucking Martins? It's crazy, right? Who does this guy think he is? A goddamned Kennedy? This guy's the tits! Ladies, let's have a shot before everyone gets here. Or two. I want to get super weird today. You already are weird. Thanks. -There we go. -You're welcome! This literally has a pube in it. It's disgusting! ["Never Coming Down" by Midnight Riot] So, did you get any? -Any what? -Cut the shit. Tell me you broke that dick off! - Wait a minute. -Come on! I'll text you. What happened? I think Kort broke someone's dick off. -What? I want to hear! -Oh my god! Oh come on! Cough it up! We just kissed on the cheek. Fuck, yeah! Daniel, the lacrosse transfer. Wait, wait! The mancer from Maryland? They went on a date. -Would you stop? -Take it from the top. Okay, okay, okay... Alright. We walk in, it's gorgeous! Like, there are all these pictures of DC on the wall, like flappers and pictures of the Potomac, and the hostess took us to our table, and we sat down, and we just started talking... I don't know! And that's when she's sucked his dick. Oh... -In the restaurant? - Ah ha! Just like Jackie O would have wanted! Allie, hurry up! You don't need make up. We're just going to study. Oh my god! What happened to you? Oh yeah, I know, I'm fine. It's just I couldn't find a scarf. Is that a hickey? -Who did that to you? -I have no idea. I could have done it to myself for all I know. I got to go have brunch with my mum. What? Hey, do you think I should text Steven? Hmm? Do you think I should text Steven? Why? Oh, because I want to. I thought you said he only texts you after 2am? Yeah, but... I feel like sometimes guys don't really know how to communicate-- Where are you going? I'm in the middle of a sentence! Kort! Don't you agree like sometimes guys just don't know how to communicate and they like need you to be the one to initiate? 'Cause we're just like putting all this pressure on them to be the ones, but... maybe they need us to be the ones. And I just need to get creative and to let him know that it's cool to text me during the day. Kort, what are you looking for? -A book! -Oh my god! I'm sorry. I have a classic tale in 15 and I'm like oddly stressed about it. Oh shit! Okay, so I feel like, first class, having a first date, is like really pivotal. Really? Yeah, I mean, I think... But yeah, I feel like now is the time to just like pump the brakes and start with the mind games. What mind games? Poker face! You don't like him. -I don't like him? - No! -Okay. -I don't see you. I'm winning, but you don't know. -Yeah. -I'm full royal flush, and kings and queens, and all those... You never played poker? I still feel weird. I mean, you feel awkward, which is normal, because it's going to be so awkward when you see it. Thanks. -Cool if I sit here? - If you want. Cool! What does it mean to you when I say "run like a girl"? It means run as fast as you can. Throw like a girl. So, do you think you just insulted your sister? No. Is "like a girl" a good thing? I feel like he's judging me. Hmm... He is! -I don't care. You know, sometimes it's kind of wild -to think about. -What? I don't know like all this. The Capitol, monuments, White House... all the huge decisions like they've made here while we're just worried about flipping cups and hooking up. You get dumb shit here too. So last year I spent every working day trying to figure out where... Hey! What are you doing? Oh, I'm just getting a feel for the facts. Apparently I do, where a high school kid was... She has a nice voice. Yeah! Yeah, I like it too. -Hey, um, quick question? -Hmm. What do you think about Jay's testimony? I mean it seems pretty suspect, right? And this mister "S" guy, he's a real wild card, I mean who is he, where did he come from? I have no idea what you're talking about. But... uh... good luck... with this. - I don't know. - Come on! If you don't like it, if it hurts, we'll stop. Let's just try it. Well, my siblings all root for each other. My parents are still together and... unfortunately they still kiss in public... And oh, I always had to have the new gaming system, like... right when they came out. -So you're a spoiled? -Oh god... I hate that word, but... yes. I like to think that I came from a good family. What about you? Are your... Are your parents happy? Yeah! They're happy it's just... not with each other. As simple as that? Yeah. Do you mind if I change the subject? Yes, please. Oh, hey, what does Allie think of me? Did I... pass the test? I don't know. We don't really talk about you that much. So stupid! Oh, I'm famous, I'm pretty. Oh, I'm married. -Hey, Allie. -Hey. Whatever! Fuck you, Mom! I know it's your money, but it's my credit card. It has my name on it. Oh... Hello... Hey, Kort... Um... Will you date me? [speech drown out by louder music] Okay, what are you thinking? I'm thinking... What the fuck is this? - What? -You're dating? Are you fucking kidding me? Hello. Hi. Kitchen! Yesterday! Allie... Were you not even going to tell me about this? What are you talking about? It just happened ten minutes ago. I thought you'd be happy for me. I am. Seriously, I am. Now, I want you to notice both on the front end, and on the back. For example, if the factory is operating at its optimal capacity, and there are zero bottlenecks, everything should be fine, right? Wrong! Because, even if everything has been taken care of on the front end, Now, what am I talking about? Daniel! Um... Exactly! Elaborate. Um... It's kind of like when your factory, it makes stuff, but at the same time enough other stuff to keep all the machines happy. Right? You're an idiot! Not as far off as you would think. To the big board. Huh! Mmm, look at this little cup of fuck pudding! Mmm... I'd like to give you a tour of this campus! Are those jeans from Europe? Just kidding, come back! Who are you listening to? Um... Nelly... Furtado. What? Oh, this is cute! -Do you want to try that on? -Oh, no that's okay. -Sure? - Why not, come on! It'll look good on you. Why don't you try something on? I just... I don't think it's sitting on me quite right. I know something that will sit on you! -Honey, no! -What? It's legal now! What are you doing? Stop! I do not respond well to this. What? Come on, do it for me. D-Man. Who is D-Man? -It's just what they used to call me back in the hood. Give me the spoon! I will take the spoon! Come on, that's not fun. That's no fun. Mmm... It's so good! -Go fuck yourself! So, you've really never played before? Nope! -Okay. -What I'm doing right here is called cradling. -Okay. -So, it's like as if you were, -you know-- -Cradling. I'm going to toss you the ball now. So just kind of accept it as opposed to trying to catch it as if you're a statue. -Okay. Like this? - Right? - Yes. -Okay. -I'm impressed! -Beginner's luck! take it back as-- I... I got in on a lacrosse scholarship! -Hmm. -Allie too. So now we have trust issues. So, thank you for that! So, why did you quit? I don't know... I mean, I like lacrosse, it's just... college sports are a lot of work, you know? I just don't know if it's really worth it. For me, at least. But it got me into a school I probably shouldn't have gotten into. I knew it! What? I knew that you were dumb. -I knew it! -I'm dumb? I just knew it! Rude! I'm joking. What about Allie? Did she just quit because you quit? To be fair, no. I just think she's... lazy. Hey, Pam! Yeah? Have you ever felt like... you're happy for someone... uh, you know, like... like you're happy for someone... I mean you're completely happy for them, but you're like... want what they have... Oh! Yeah! I'm jealous all the time! -No! -I mean I'm jealous of you for being funnier than me. And Kort for being prettier, and Mary for eating less than me at dinner. And Luce for sexting all the lacrosse guys, even though I do find it morally questionable, slash, would secretly do the same. And Jen for saying the shit that I think but I'm actually too scared to say. Huh! Why, what's up? Nothing! Okay, well... I'm going to go do some laundry. Bye. Hey, Allie! Daniel and I are going to go and catch a movie if you want-- I'm so sorry. Hey, Mar! -Hey... um... -What's going on? Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah? Okay... um... Daniel was in my dream last night. We were in South Carolina eating Chick-fil-A, even though it was a Sunday, and it started out slow, but by the end of it he had me kind of over the back of his Chevy and was raw dogging me, on the hood. I'm really sorry. Okay... Thank you for... being honest. What? Oh, fancy seeing you here! What's that supposed to mean? Nothing, I just... Crazy! But... I think I have something fun for us! Oh yeah? You want cheese on this, right? Yes, please. Okay. So, Daniel's friend, also name is Daniel, actually, is renting out the for his birthday, and he wants all of us to come. Are they going to be boys there? Um... tons! Okay, I'm listening. Okay, so it's this Sunday, nine o'clock. I know, he's like one of those has to celebrate his birthday on his birthday types. Eww! Okay, well, can we do a girl's day before? Um... I actually told Daniel I'd go to the Skins game with him. You're calling them the Skins now? Okay. Well, will you still help me to get ready? Duh! It's a one o'clock game. Okay. Do you think like... I don't know, do you think she likes him more than me? No, you're right, you're right! That's stupid! I just... I don't know, I get... I get self-conscious, 'cause like... I feel like he's replacing me. Do you think he is replacing me? Come on, Will! I've got to go! What the fuck, I was talking to him! You don't even care! Oh shit! You want to see me? At 11:30, aka 30 minutes ago, and no, it's my job to see you, by no means do I want to be here. Sit down! So, it appears that this being tardy thing is becoming a bit of an issue. who wrote, "It's almost as though she's trying to be late." Do you have anything to say? Uh-hm. You do realize that just as in life, this type of behavior does have consequences? Yeah, I mean, I thought, I don't really don't have to go to class. Well... you don't have to do anything. I don't have to... mow my lawn. But I do! Because it keeps my neighbors happy. Was that... an innuendo? The point is, if you don't take action, more often than not, these things tend to come back and bite you. And... not in a good... "Oh, that feels nice" kind of way! I think we're done here! Oh, okay. So, do you want to eat first, or do you want to grab food there? Well I don't want to really eat hotdogs, so... Hold on one second. What's up? I'm just going to get my nails done, but... I wanted to say have fun at the game. Cool! Thanks. You too. Um... Alright. See you later. Sorry.... Yeah. Yeah, we can get Chinese. You excited for tonight? Yeah, I guess. A little nervous, actually. Allie, can I be frank? Yeah. You're a little boy crazy. What? You torture yourself over all this shit, and I really don't know why? I mean... sex, love, having a boyfriend, it's... supposed to be fun. I like the game! I like to flirt, I like the chase, And maybe that's you, maybe it's not, I don't know. But, that's for you to figure out. Just don't live off the world's ideals because most of them are just a bunch of bullshit. There's no more rule book, Allie. Let's go with black. Hey, Allie! Hi. Can I have one of those? Yep. Your usual. And then, maybe one of those. Ah, you're getting adventurous on me. Yep. Just gone crazy. Don't tell me Jay was scared. Don't tell me... -Hey, is Kort around? -Oh yeah, I think she's in her room. Okay. We didn't have them 15 years ago. And we still don't have them now. What? Is this a joke? Finish the GD story, sweetheart! Who does this? Dude, I'm sorry, that pedicure took forever. I'm just going to shower really quick, I swear I'm not even going to masturbate. Just kidding, no promises. Whore, don't even act that you're not impressed, I was less than five minutes. Okay, okay, so I'm thinking about going super scandalous tonight, I'm going to let these ass cheeks leak out a little bit. Whatever, just tell me what you think. Oh! ♪ I get so excited ♪ Guys, dudes, let her chose! Let her chose! I don't care if she's your babe. -There's no easy buckets. -No easy buckets. -No easy buckets! -Uh-uh. Kort, could you please shut these guys up? Yeah, bring it, bring it! Bro! You know, I definitely prefer wine over beer. It just makes me feel more... more like a lady! You know, more sophisticated. Kind of... I read a study that says it's rich in probiotics. Plus it helps me get fucked up. Cheers to that. Does my hair look all right? Yeah, solid! Nice! I just switched products, so... Allie, what's the deal, why aren't you dressed? Yeah, I'm fine. Oh I'm just... Um... waiting for Kort, because I told her that I would help her get dressed. You know how we do. Hmm! Oh, shit! I totally forgot to relay. Okay, so I talked to Kort, beer pong tournament thingy with Daniel, at a completely different location. So, she's just going to have to meet at the party. Give me that fucking wine. Sorry. Hi! Thank you. What the fuck are you doing? What do you mean, what are you doing? You should not be drinking any more, and you have to hold-- What? I look great, it's like a dress basically. Thank you so much. You so don't need that! I'm sorry, Luce, I don't remember asking you what I need. Allie, maybe we should take you home. Thank you, they'll pay. I'll have a glass of Pinot. -Oh, hey, Kort! - Hey! Hey! How was the game? - It was really fun. -Really, was it? Yeah! Yeah, it was really fun! Oh, and how was the beer pong tournament? It was really fun, Allie. -It was? - Yeah! -Was it great? -Yeah. That's great, I'm so happy for you. And did you have a good time, Danny Boy? -Yeah, it was a fine time. -You did? Hey, guess what? I like to have a good time too. I'll suck your dick for a dollar. -Allie! - What? -She's kidding. -Yeah, I'm kidding. I'll do it for free. What the fuck is your problem? What's my problem? What's your problem? You just give everything up for some guy you met two months ago! You just said you were going to blow him! Yeah, I was just trying to get in on the fun. He's my fucking boyfriend, Allie! He's your only friend... Kort! Fuck you! Phil, can I get a dollar? Hey, Allie! Allie! I just want to let you know, it's not my fault you went off the reservation and stopped taking care of yourself. It's not my fault you're a vain whore, who replaced me with Captain America. Don't give me bullshit, because I can get a guy and you can't. You sleep all day. You don't study for anything. You don't push yourself to do anything. You're just a selfish dick who expects the whole world to fall into your lap. Thanks, Kort! No, don't do that. Take some fucking responsibility for once in your life! God! This is why I'm not going abroad with you. Perfect, well I'll just be in Great Britain getting bukkaked, and you'll be here dating Daniel. -Great! -Awesome! What's bukkaked? Um... when a man and woman love each other, a man invites all of his friends over... You know what? Kort told me what happened, and don't worry! A lot of guys can't get their dicks hard, when they're fucking 40! Daniel, what's she talking about? Uh oh! Is she wearing a towel? Where the fuck have you been? Trash. -What? - In the trash. Who was that? I have no idea. No, I mean, it was Allie, but... She looks like shit! Kort? Kort! Is she in there? Yeah, she's in there. Oh! Fucking yoga bitches! Fuck! Fuck, it's hard! Oh god! This isn't a bad pace! Not a bad place at all! And so, as managers, the problem we're left to solve is, how do we repair our system's flaws? -So as to return to a point... as closer to optimal while still living with the fact that optimal doesn't necessarily mean perfect. You see, we're not just in a theoretics class here, where we bank on stand-alone principles in a vacuum. We're dealing with real issues in the real world. -You got to see this, man! -Awesome, man! Alright, I'll see you. Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know who you're talking to? I'm the Dean of goddamn students, sweetheart! -Oh my god, I'm so sorry. -It's too late! You're expelled! Just kidding! I don't have the power to do that Hey... I just need you to listen to me for one second. Hear me out, baby girl. Okay. Everything okay? -Huh? -Yeah, everything's great. What are you making? I'm not really sure, but I feel really cool because I measured a bunch of shit, and I got to mince something for the first time. Oh, do you want help? Uh-uh! No way, I got this. Fucking son of a mother-fucker! That's so hot! All right. I have my phone if you need me. Thank you. Shh... Say no more. I didn't say anything. Okay, you're good, you're good! I got you! -You know I can't see, right? -I know, I've got you. Hey! Oh, I'll let you two be. Actually, I prepared something. Daniel, this first part is for you. My apologies for the other night when I offered to fellate you, and also for the things I said about your dick, and it's limpness. That was both rudely inappropriate, and a pretty dumb thing to do. And now, Kort, this second part is for you. My apologies for the other night when I offered to fellate your boyfriend Daniel, previously mentioned in the first part of the speech, and also-- -Allie! -...this dinner-- We get it! Okay, the point is, I'm sorry. Truly! It was all... very unbecoming of me. Oh! Thank you for your time. I love you! Allie told me that if I didn't say that she'd... shank me and make it seem like it was an accident. Jesus! I'm sorry. I hope I didn't ruin this? No, you didn't. It's supposed to be chicken, but... But it's a liquid though, I don't understand it. If you skim it off the top it's not as bad. Hey, guys. -Hey! -How is it? - Um... -It's um... It's fucking horrible, isn't it? It's really not very good, Allie. Daniel, any thoughts? I mean it's not bad, but um... It... it's just tough to chew and... swallow. Yeah, I kind of saw this coming. Yes! Real food! Do you mind if I have a sip of this? So are you going to hold this over my head forever? I don't know! I just might though. Would make up sex help? Is that all you girls think about? -Mmm. - It is, isn't it? -What, it's been like a week! - Really! What? Are you not going to help? Um... She... She handcuffed me to the table! - Oh my god! - Yeah! So, how's it going out there? Looks like it's going well! I mean... not that I'm watching! I'm not! I'm just... From the few glances that I've stolen, it... Looks like it's going well! And I only saw those glances because I want to keep the standard of service high. Sure. - Yeah, it's going well! -Good. I like him. Yeah... Me too. So why did you act like that? I... don't know, I guess it was just... more fun when we were chasing them together, than when you were dating him alone. Yeah, I guess I wasn't the best... best friend, was I? I kind of got caught up there for a while. Hey um... You didn't mean that abroad thing, did you? Yeah... I did. I mean, not for those reasons but... I never really wanted to go. Okay. Can I give you some good news? Yes, now would be a good time. He has a friend that thinks you're hot. Proceed. Apparently, he thinks you have a nice ass! This ass? That ass! Okay, I'll take it! He wants to take you out for a drink. -Shut the fuck up! Oh my god! Whatever. I did that to be dramatic! I fucking hate that plate! Tell me what we are working with? You look good! - Stop that! -How do you feel? I feel good. I do. I'm a little nervous though. You can be nervous. You're just not allowed to fuck him! Does that rule still stand? - Yes! -Like a 100%? Yes, you slut! Great! The dress looks good too. Really? I don't know, kind of feel like I'm made for these things. - Alright, perfume? - Check! - ID? - Check! And...? It's the first date! I'm just asking! I trimmed! Daniel, thoughts? Gorgeous! -It's very sweet of you D-Mac. Okay. Go on. I... oh, bye! ["The Day I Died" by Alex Winston] Can I help you? Huh? Are you looking for someone? Oh! No. I'm okay! Oh, would you look at the slice of apple pie! Come over here, cutie! What's up, little boo? I'd like to give you a tour of this... This camp-pus... You ever seen Mystic River? Little Sean Penn wannabe!
