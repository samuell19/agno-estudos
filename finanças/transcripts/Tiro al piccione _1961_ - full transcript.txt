Blackshirts, Italians. After my recent silence, you now hear my voice, and I am sure you will recognise it. September 1943. The Italian Armed Forces, after being defeated in Greece, Albania, on the Don, in Africa, and in Sicily, were left on their own after the armistice of September 8. The King and Badoglio had fled to Brindisi. A prisoner at Campo lmperatore, the man who had led Italy to defeat was freed by German paratroopers and brought to Germany. "The fuhrer," Mussolini later said, "was worried about me." Anglo-American forces occupied a third of Italy. After 21 years of fascist monarchy, Mussolini established a Republic under the protection of the Nazi Army. The Republic of Sale. It lasted 600 days. The bloodiest, most dramatic 600 days in our history. For Italians at the time, a word or a gesture could be dangerous, often a question of life or death. For someone who was 20 years old, knowing almost nothing about the world, who needed to experience adventure or rebellion, it was not always easy to find one's way. DEATH PENALTY. It was terrible to become a man at that time. WILL BE SHOT. RELENTLESS WITH THE ENEMY IMPECCABLE WITH THE PEOPLE Sergeant, report to the guard post. Sergeant, report to the guard post. Hey, comrade, how's it going? Bye. Sergeant! Gather the recruits! Hey, Fascist, we're here! Get out! - You say you're a fascist? - Why shouldn't I be? - What's your name? - Marco Laudato. - Run away from home? - That's none of your business. - Where are you from? - Near Cremona. Put down those chests! Bring them to the orderly room. I've never liked people from Cremona. - And where are you from? - You, who? Me? - Yes. - Well, all over the place. - Bir el Gobi, in particular. - Ah, were you born there? The second time. The first time was in Bergamo. I've never liked people from Bergamo. You've got quite the mouth on you, you know? Go on, help unload! Go! Come on, guys! Two at a time, come on! Come on, guys! Jesus, hurry UP! Keep going! Keep going! Sergeant. Who is this boy? No one, Lieutenant. Just some kid who's more talkative than brave. We need brave people here, weaklings don't last long. Understood? Enlist him. Certainly, Lieutenant. Let's go, Cremona boy. Come on, you slackers! Come on, hurry up! NATIONAL REPUBLICAN GUARD Come on! Excuse me, sir, where is this? Upstairs. Don't you know how to read? Follow me. - Francesco Maggioni. - Present! - Antonio Rovera. - Present! - Giuseppe Tamilloni. - Present! - Giorgio Rinaldi. - Present! Why are you enlisting? Because I hate black people. And I don't want them on our country's soil. Good. Move over. Come here. Sign this guy up. Salute. - Name? - Marco Laudato. - Age? - 19. Son of? Come on! Where do you think you are? I haven't asked for your ID card! - Son of? - Teresa Buff anti. - Alive? - Alive, yes. - Your father? - Giovanni Laudato. Died, in the war in Africa. - Where were you born? - In Offanengo, Province of Cremona. 28 October 1925. An historical date. Go on, sign it. The Duce was the first to say it. Make way for the young! So it is up to you young men to recover our country's flag from mud and dish on our, and not accept the betrayal of a traitorous king! Only you young men can make it feel the sun of victory once more, alongside our loyal German allies, against the Anglo-American invaders and their Bolshevik accomplices. This war will decide the fate of our countrymen. There has never been such a national, proletariat war. This moment belongs to you young men! At this solemn time, remember that only one thing matters: winning! Swear that you will serve and defend the Italian Social Republic, its institutions and its laws, its hon our and its lands, in peace and in war, up until the supreme sacrifice. Swear it before God and fallen soldiers, for the independence, the unity and the future of our country! - Do you swear? - I swear! Kiss it! Kiss the feather and respect the old man who is your Commander. Comrades, with this one, we've done them all. Come on, get up! The front row is for our honoured guests! Come on! Nice day, eh? - Come here. - But I... Silence! About face! He's got a big butt! It's decided, then. Big Butt will be our mascot. Perfect! - Stop it, all of you! - Silence, Jesus Christ! Attention! Order of business for the recruits. You. You. - You. - Hey, how's it going? And you, will go clean the toilets. Big Butt and Smarty-pants, to the mess hall. Forward, march! - Go, go! - Go! These guys work hard, you know. Nice and shiny, now! I have to eat here, wash it! It takes some elbow grease! - Sparkling! - They mustn't smell. I've never even seen toilets cleaned so poorly. Hey! Want me to take off your underpants and teach you some respect? Calm down, calm down. I came here to fight, not to be teased by you. Alright, we're all fascists here. Come on, wash up. You serve the country by washing up too, my dear Laudato. Come on, lazybones! Let's go, Pasquino. I think that one's trouble. NATIONAL ASSEMBLY OF THE FASCIST PARTY A month went by. Two months. Mussolini's so-called Social Republic used confusion and lies to justify its existence, providing Hitler with lab our and soldiers. "Victory is certain", the fuhrer had telegraphed to Mussolini. - Hello, Merry Christmas. - Give me that list. - Here's the sugar. - Thank you. Your name? Is the marsala finished? Write me down for this bottle. This is dog shit. - Here, I'll take care of it. - Trust him. - Raise the prices, now. - Don't worry. Don't let them cheat you like last time. Understand? Business today too, eh? Hey, Laudato, you didn't get much at home, did you? Well, actually... Shut up, idiot! You've never seen so much money before! Hurry up and pick up your package. We're going out. - There's Gioioso. Are you coming? - Yeah. See you! - How much did you get? - 20! - Hey, will you sell me that? - No, no. I pay well! - Comrade! - Are you talking to me? - Will you sell me that sugar? - Not here. Let's go. Merry Christmas, madam. Come on, let's go. - Hey, Laudato! - Hey. - Where are you running off to? - To find his mum! I was looking for you. Want to go to a restaurant? No, first to a whorehouse. Where does a Blackshirt go when he has a day off? - Come on. - Let's go! SLOW DOWN DANGER! - Hey, stupid! - Idiot! There are patrols here! It's worse here than in Greece. Were you in the Greek campaign, too? Listen, Pasquini was in the Spanish, in the Abyssinian, in the Greek... And he's about to be in the Bolognese! If she's free. Thank God for the Holidays! Come on, otherwise you'll let it all out at New Year's. Hey, come on! You'll find a girlfriend here. I think he's never tried. - Poor thing! - At his age, I... I'm going to take a walk around town. What's there to see in Vercelli, anyway? - I'll go to the cinema later on. - Go to the cinema then. There's our Commander, family-style. Be good, alright? Don't act naughty, or daddy will get angry. - What are we waiting for? - Let's go. Yeah! - Excuse me, how much does it cost? - 20 cents. Thank you. - Why don't you shoot, Legionnaire? - No, thank you. Come shoot, come on! Antonella! Antonella! Excuse me... That's sugar, isn't it? Would you sell it to me? It's so hard to find. Would you sell it to me? Here. Take it, I don't want any money. Excuse me, sir... I wanted to buy it. - I don't want anything, take it. - You're so kind. Why don't you come have a coffee at my house? I live just over there. Come on, accept a coffee at least. It's not real coffee, but you know... Come. I'll go in first. Because of the neighbours. I never thought I would have to spend a Christmas like this. I've been alone for a year now. Completely alone. If you only knew what that meant. A husband who's missing in Russia and a little girl to look after. She's so little, she needs a lot of things. These aren't nice things to talk about, I'm sorry. You're so young. - I don't want to make you sad. - I'm not sad. You're a good boy. It's hard to find someone like you nowadays. Come, I want to show you my daughter. Come. Quiet, or you'll wake her up. - She's sleeping. - Yes. Have a seat. Have a seat, you must be tired. Lie down. You'll be more comfortable. Lie down. Mummy... mummy. Mummy... Out! Get out! Let's throw him out of the courtyard! Out! We don't want fascists here! Understand? You scum! Throw away that uniform! Go home, Fascist! Good one! Come on, one more! Drinking alone... Baby Jesus is born, Gioioso! Come on! Come on, let's drink some more. Cheers, cheers, to olive oil! What a bore. When he gets started... Cheers. - Cheers! - Hey, brunette! The bill. Coming! Come here, honey. Don't you like us? Look who's here. Sergeant! Hey, Laudato. What's wrong? What happened? Well? What happened? Talk! Who was it? Talk! Who was it? I don't know, they jumped out at me. - I was coming out of a woman's house... - What house, where? I don't know, near here. Over by the flyover. - Come on, guys! - We're going to that woman's house, now! Are you scared? You all hate us! You're all terrified. - All of you! - Come on, Garrani! Let's go, Marco. There! Pay the bill with this. I've defused the bomb. They're peeing their pants! We have to teach them a lesson! A lesson, understand? Absolutely! - Here. - Bastards! I'm going to cut a few throats tonight, you have Pasquini's word. They hurt you, didn't they? You're unarmed? Here, take this. Come on, you two! Come on, now! Hey, look at that! Damn traitors! Cowards, traitors! Come out! - Would you kill the German? - Are you crazy? Hey, no more trouble, guys! Back to the barracks, let's go! You too, Marco, come on! Come on, let's go! You don't mess with those guys. Women don't love us anymore, because we wear black shirts. They tell us we should be tied up, they tell us we should be in jail. Love with fascists isn't worth it... fear... Women don't love us anymore, because we wear black shirts. They tell us we should be tied up... Sergeant? Why don't women love us anymore? - Tell me why. - They're probably foolish, I don't know. Relax, and don't bother me. - Will they keep us here for long still? - Who knows. - What about The Duce? - Well, The Duce... Would you two quit it? Quiet. Now go to sleep. You'll have time to get even. Good night, Elia. Good night, Marco. The people they called the sole defenders of the country surrendered Trieste and Alto Adige to the Germans, which thus became a German province governed by a Gauleiter. ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR THE ADRIATIC LITTORAL in the cities and in the mountains, the Resistance movement started to form. People the fascists called outlaws took up arms. Violence and abuse of power were met with gunpowder. Get out of the lorries! Get down, everyone! Spread out! On the ground! Get on the ground! - Find somewhere to hide! Hurry! - Careful, there are more mines. Get out! This morning at dawn, 1 kilometre away from here, another crime was committed against Hitler's Armed Forces and the Social Republic. The Badoglian outlaws killed a German soldier and a Blackshirt. According to the High Command of the German forces in Italy, appropriate retaliation measures will be taken immediately. For each of the soldiers who were killed, 10 civilians will be executed. The sentence will be carried out if those responsible for the attack do not come forward within the hour. It will act as a warning to traitors and their accomplices. Men, women, Italians... if you know who is responsible for the attack, report them! Help us to arrest them. You will save your life, and the lives of your families! Just as we are relentless with the enemy, we want to be impeccable with the people. But woe to those who are against us! Cowards. Why don't they come forward? An iron fist... - Would you do it? - Yes. I wouldn't. - I don't like blackmailing. - What? No weakness when it comes to enemies of the Axis. No weakness. As you can see, Lieutenant, we are always ready to carry out orders. - Cigarette? - Yes, thank you. - Just a moment. - Certainly. Done. But no one will come forward. And we will execute the hostages this time, too. Of course. The point is to establish that one of us is worth 10 of them. That's already an important step. Captain, we need to eliminate the rebels and punish those who help them. Certainly, Lieutenant. But those are just words. Carry out the Germans' orders. It will be neither you nor I that wins the war. - Pasquale! - Daddy! - Stop, don't move! - Pasquale! Stop the civilians! Two of you, with me! Shall we? Hold them back. - What were those shots? - Lieutenant, I didn't let him get away! As soon as I got within range... I got rid of him! Idiot! You don't shoot them like that! Hostages must be shot in public, in the square. Let's get back to town. January 1944. The Allies arrived in Anzio. "One problem dominates above all others," said Mussolini. "The absolute need to return to combat, to move from the state of martyrdom-war that Italy is currently in, to a state of fighting-war. If our ancestors shouted "Rome or Death!" It means that Rome symbolises the life, the history, the heart of our people." From Milan, Mussolini asked once again to march on Rome. Blackshirts, soldiers! Our great moment has finally arrived! Following the example of the Barbarigo battalion, you too will take up arms on the front line! The Duce himself has ordered me to bring you this message: Remember that you are Blackshirts! Legionnaires! - All hail The Duce! - To us! Stop, stop, Legionnaires! Stay back! Stay back! - Legionnaires! All hail The Duce! - To us! To us! To us! Duce! Duce! Duce! Duce! With two bombs and a flower in our mouths! Battalions of The Duce, battalions, created from death for life. The games start in Spring, the world is in flames and flower. To win, we need Mussolini's lions, armed with velour! Win! Win! Win! We'll win in the sky, on the ground, and in the sea! It is the promise of a higher will! Win! Win! Win! It's going to be quite the initiation rite for these teenagers. The journalists will love it. Wonderful propaganda. I don't like that mountain. It's useless to conquer it, useless to defend it. It's useless in every sense of the word. You're forgetting about the troops' spirit. They need to fight. You're forgetting about the situation. Cannons, landing strips, tanks. Our back is exposed like a woman in an ball gown. Determination and courage will take care of everything this time, too. We will conquer the Cimbrone. Certainly. Maybe. - You don't sound very convinced. - I'm not. But there's nothing to be afraid of. You just have to see things the way they are. I'm going to take over the command post. Good luck, Nardi. Thank you, Captain. - On the ground! - Get down! On the ground! Let's keep going! Keep going! Marco! Where are you going? Marco! Marco! Once Rome was liberated, Mussolini updated the old slogan "Rome or Death". "We tell the Romans," he said, "do not give in morally to the invaders. We warn all the Italians of the Social Republic: do not let the fall of Rome wear down your energy, or your desire to create the conditions to take it back." After Rome, Florence was liberated. A miracle saved Hitler. He was lucky once again. - Hold on, just a minute. - No, let me go. - Did you ask for leave? - No. You promised you would leave with me. Quit it! Come on, don't be ridiculous. Anna, you're not in love, are you? - Don't be silly. - Then what's wrong? I've changed my mind, that's all. His fever's gone, Doctor! - Who are you? - Anna, I'm a nurse. But you're not supposed to talk. Why not? What's wrong with me? Relax, it's nothing serious. You'll recover. You're so young. Don't... don't leave me, Anna. You almost choked me last night when your fever was high. Forgive me, I don't remember anything. But... why are you a nurse? Well... because I like to be with you boys. You haven't been doing this job long, have you? No. - Can I call you Anna? - You already are. - Do you mind? - No, it's my name. Now, drink. - I don't like that doctor. - Why not? He's a good doctor. - I don't know, but I don't like him. - Come, now. Don't go, Anna. Stay here, with me. No, don't worry. It's far away, over by the railway tracks. - Now we just have to give it time. - Will it be long, Doctor? Give it time. I'm sick of lying in bed. It's a question of morale. Cheer up, Laudato! - Miss. - Professor. Look here. Listen to what they've written. "One of Mussolini's young men, barely more than a boy, Marco Laudato, has already joined the legendary ranks of the Republic's shining heroes." Why aren't you looking at me? Look at me. Aren't you interested? I imagine it's pride, all pride. But you should be pleased. How do I look? It looks like a brooch for a ball gown. Gold ones aren't really gold. They're silver and vermeil, like clips. How does it feel to be dressed in civilian clothes? Hey, Laudato! Laudato... Ah, things are looking up here. Excuse me, I'll leave you. Why? No, we'd love it if you stayed. I would, at least. It's a pleasure. Captain Mattei. The presence of a beautiful woman is always good for a soldier. Right, Laudato? My boy, we have good news for you. The Captain will tell you. - Would you like a chair? - No, thank you. I've just come to tell Laudato the news, but I have to get back to the command post Your friends say hello. One of these days I'll give them leave to come visit you. Did you tell him about the stripes, Nardi? Sergeant's stripes! Well? Have you got nothing to say? What do these boys want? They're so strange! I wish I was injured, too. Not too seriously, of course. Good luck, Laudato! Bye, Sergeant. Don't just think about him, madam. Save some room for me, too. See you soon, Laudato! You like receiving compliments, eh? Congratulations, Sergeant. To Sergeant Marco Laudato. I'd like to make a toast to Carla. - He's already drunk. - Carla? Who is Carla? A bitch, my brother's friend's girlfriend. Who went off with the partisans. I'm not drinking to anyone. I don't care. Actually, I'll drink to the dead. Great! Nice toast! Really nice toast! No! Let's drink to the health of the living, that's all! I don't care about the dead! They can't all be in Heaven, can they? Of course. Everyone who dies on the battlefield goes to Heaven. My uncle told me so! What? They're all in Heaven? English, Spanish, Abyssinian? They're all in Heaven? And what about me? - Jesus! - No. No, even in Heaven they'll ignore us. Why will they ignore us? Never mind. Try to stay alive. - Long live Carla! - Shut up, Boccia, you talk too much! Hey... can we see her naked? Come on, don't take it personally. He's kidding! Don't take it personally, Boccia. May Carla win the war! Why Carla? Carla and the Americans. And in the mountains, the partisans. Hey! Are you joking? I wish. But it's exactly what I think. We are completely done for. - Hey, defeatist! - We've lost the war. - At least a year ago. - What are you talking about? - Elia, shut up! - What's wrong with you? Absolutely nothing, Sergeant. - You were kidding, right? - Yes. Will you show us Carla naked or not? Have you seen this? Wonderful! Take them to the other hospital. There are too many of them here. Help me. Take me away. Mummy! Marco. Marco, I'm taking you away from here. I'm taking you away. This car will take us down there. From there, we'll continue by train. You look nice in civilian clothing. Just for tonight? Yes, just for tonight. - Sleep well. - Thank you. Sleep well. Here we are. Don't we seem like a country bride and groom on our wedding night? - What's wrong? - I don't know. This doesn't seem real. It's the first time you're alone with me. No, that's not why. I was just thinking that I don't know you. Anna, I don't know anything about you. About your life. You told me about a girl once. A girl who couldn't manage to fall in love. She would go out with all the guys... and then she would leave them. Why are you thinking about that story right now? Because I'm scared. I'm scared of falling in love. What else did I tell you? That she's married. To a very, very rich man. Older than her. But she couldn't take it anymore. What else? Anna. You're that girl, aren't you? What are you saying? You're crazy! Listen, Marco. Don't bother me with that story. Anna. What now? Nothing. Nothing. I'm thirsty. I'll drink to your glorious wounds. Don't drink too much. The problem is that you don't drink at all. Marco, somebody's here. No, nobody's here. How silly of me! Maybe it's the wind. Madam. Wow! Come on in! - Good morning, Angelo. - Always at your service. Look. - Do you like it? - It's magnificent. - I knew you were going to like it. - Naturally! It's beautiful here. Doesn't it seem like the war is over? You didn't imagine it like this, did you? Here, this is the way upstairs! Is it yours? I wish! It belongs to a man from Milan, an old friend of mine. Come on! Come on up! Anna, I want to tell you... something. Something very important. Will you marry me? Anna? Anna? Thank you. See you soon, Anna. Let's go. Anna. Marco! You startled me! Why were you gone so long? If you only knew what kind of a day I've had! Come on, help me! Anna. Who were you with? Listen, Marco... Why won't you tell me who you were with? I have lots of friends. You know that, right? You should be thanking me instead. You see this letter? It arrived two weeks ago. You were supposed to leave immediately. I managed to push it back until today. Actually, until tomorrow. If day after tomorrow you aren't there, though, they'll declare you a deserter. Yes, Sergeant. War is starting up again! The 600 days of the Social Republic were running out. The Americans and the British had been stopped at the Gothic Line. The partisans disregarded General Alexander's proclamation, in which he encouraged them to stop fighting, and continued fighting like a real army, backed by the people. They controlled entire regions. Everyone do everything for victory, for the triumph of freedom. Special edition of documents. THE ALPINE PARTISAN Hatred and retaliation were unleashed against them. ATTENTION! THE BRIGADE SEES YOU, HEARS YOU AND PUNISHES YOU! Hey, Laudato. - Hi, Gioioso. - I'm happy to see you again. How's it going here? It's hot, Sergeant. You'll see how your ass burns. - Is that the command post? - Yeah, you'll see what a mess it is. - Is there a party going on? - After six, only the police are out. And everyone inside makes a racket. There's a curfew. - Why? - Operational Zone, Laudato. There's a curfew because we're in an Anti-partisan Operational Zone. - Bye, see you. - Bye, see you later. Go on, what are you waiting for? To find these few bottles, I had to look all over town. Careful of the wine bottle! - Damn it! - Garrani, be careful with the wine! Stop touching me! Look who's here! Hi! Hey, guys, look who's here! Back from the dead! The hero, the living corpse! - Captain, here's the heroic corpse. - Hi, Sergeant. Are you back to get another medal? It's easy here, you know? A war cross, an iron cross, a wooden cross. Nardi! Welcome back. You've come at the right time. I hope so. Look at that chest! A war cross, a bronze medal, a silver medal. You hurry up and get one, too. There's glory for everyone here. - Good night, guys. - Good night, Commander. - Good night, Captain. - Guys, we should sing a song. - Yeah, good idea! - A song! - Yeah, let's sing a song. - Ready? - Ready. - Pistone, Mara no, come over here. Quiet now! Oh, Captain, there's a man overboard! Oh, Captain, come save him! Come here when I call you, idiot! Why the long face, Sergeant? Go on, talk. I don't know. Everyone seems different, strange. Ines. The partisans, a week ago. Ah, Ines? A kilometre outside town. Marco. - Elia. - Marco. Come with me. Come on, let's go outside. No, you're a bitch! Tell me why Pistone yes, and me no. Hey, Marco, welcome back! How are you? It's nice to see you again. - Thanks. Bye. - See you later. Why did you come back? I got a letter. Do you remember Boccia? He died. During a search of the area. Are there a lot of these cowards? They're not cowards, Marco. We've done everything we can to terrorise them. We've burnt them, shot them, hanged them. Stuff to make even the most experienced soldier sick. And what's come out of it? That now everyone is against us. Look at the town, there's no one left. No one. They're all in the mountains, with the children, the elderly, and the livestock. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? You'll see. I see things for what they are. Have you seen what Pasquini, Garrani and the others look like? Not to mention Nardi and Mattei. Who are... who are something else. Have you come alone? Alone. What about that woman? She'll come visit me. She will, she promised. I have a woman too, you know? A woman from town. Her name's Ida. She's very sweet. I'll introduce you to her. I'd like to introduce you to Anna. She's amazing. Look, up on those rocks. Those are the partisans. Look. Every evening you see their fires get closer. Marco. We're going to find them today. Trust me. Let's set up camp here! - Let me see. - Want one? Come on, we'll hold onto them this time. We'll kill them all, you'll see. Those outlaws... You have to oil your gun, if you want it to work. Want one? No, thanks. - Marco? - Thanks. Cheer up. - How do you feel, Laudato? - Well... A bit rusty, eh? It will get better. Hey, Pasquini, what are you doing? I'm about to show you. I'm about to show you... - how Pasquini... - Pasquini! Gets a partisan. I got an Abyssinian, I got a Greek, and now... and now... Behind the rocks! Get down! Hide! Thank you. Elia told me all about you. - He told me you're friends. - It's true. He's my closest friend. You're so young, Marco. How did you end up here? You can make yourself at home here. If you need anything... Thank you. I'm not going back to the barracks tonight. - You want to stay with her? - No... it's not just that. I don't fit in with the others. I'm starting to get scared. I'm getting old, and I don't even realise it. Maybe I think too much... about us. About the people in the mountains... it's all so confusing! What's happening to you, Elia? I have two nephews in the mountains. My sister's children. They say the Americans will be here soon. One is 20, like you. I'm leaving. Bye, Elia. - The lorries, the lorries! - Our lorries! Damn it! Run, Lieutenant! Quickly, everyone! Quickly! Follow me. Down there, quickly! - Let's burn their houses! - Get our revenge, teach them a lesson! Call the others. Let's get back to the valley. Hey! We're going back to the valley. Hear that? Let's get back to the others. Stop! Come out! Come out or I'll kill you. Scared, eh? What were you doing? What were you doing? Are you a partisan, too? No, sir. I wasn't doing anything, I swear. Then why aren't you in the Army? Sir, I haven't enlisted in the Army because I have to take care of my mum. I can't read or write. I have to take care of my mum. - Get out, move it! - Thank you. Elia, look. - Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye, and thank you for the lift. Any time. - What's wrong, Marco? - I don't know. Just think, Anna. One day you'll come up here, ask about me, and they'll hand you a black beret with a hole in the middle. That's all that will be left of Sergeant Marco Laudato. Don't think about death. You've got many years ahead of you. Marco. Marco... aren't you sick of this relationship? You're the only thing I have left in the world. You know that. You, and the memory of my father. I'm making you sad talking this way, aren't I? Forgive me, Anna. I didn't mean to. Forgive me, Anna. And forget about what I said. Don't worry, Marco. I've already forgotten. Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna... - I have to go now. - Will you come back? - Yes. - Tomorrow? No, not tomorrow. Tuesday. Or maybe Saturday. It was a terrible winter. The Italian Social Republic disappeared in a state of cold and hunger. Strikes took it out of the cities. Gunshots took it out of the mountains. There was just one type of madness left: secret weapons and resolution. "We'll make a single Athens out of the whole Po Valley." Come on, Gioioso, you can do it. Come on, get back in line. Keep going! - What's wrong, Gioioso? - My foot hurts, I can't go on. Come on, you can do it. - It hurts. - Fall back in! - Gioioso, get up. - I'm sorry, it hurts too badly. - I don't care, get up! - Sergeant, he can't go on. - And we're exhausted, too. Let us rest. - I give orders here! Fall back in rank. - No! - What did you say? Don't be ridiculous! Leave the men alone or I'll smash your face in! - What will you do? - Go away! Quit it, that's enough! Giuliani, you take over, and let the men rest. Guys, 10 minutes rest. Have a seat under the rocks. Have you gone mad? It's all because of that woman! Listen to me, forget about her. Marco, can't you see what's happening? It's all over now. And the men know it. That's why they're acting this way. They're just trying to survive now. - And what about our country? - Our country is on the other side. It's hard to understand for someone who's fought, like us. But it's important to know what you're fighting for. But we've always gone on like this, without thinking or understanding. Do you know why Anna left you? Because it's all over. Everything, you understand? Everything, and everyone! The Lieutenant stayed in town because Mattei cut and run. Marco, I'm not just saying this because we've lost the war! I've understood a lot of things recently. Even the medals and the wounds we carry with us are a scam! My wounds are called Mount Cimbrone! Mount Cimbrone was just a useless pile of rocks! Even for the men who gave you those medals. The same men who sent me to Africa, and who are running away now! Try to understand, Marco. You're still in time. Even... even your father would tell you the same thing, if he were here. He believed in fascism, and he died because of it. Be quiet, you scum! You're a traitor, a coward! That's what you are! Go, Marco. Go. Your place is next to Nardi. Now go. Hey, Laudato! If you want, I'll come back and pick you up! Young man, have you come to change into civilian clothes, too? - Anna spread the word. - Where is Anna? Who gave you permission to come into my villa? - Where is Anna? - Anna is upstairs. Let's hurry. Travelling is dangerous... What are you looking for here? You bastard! Listen, boy. Grab a suit and get lost. And make it quick. You coward! Get out or I'll kill you! Calm down, Marco. Quit it! Get out. I'll be waiting downstairs, Anna. Why didn't you come? I waited so long for you. It's over, Marco. What are you going to do? I don't know. Why don't you come with us? You can put on a civilian suit, and we'll all leave together. No, I'm not like Mattei. You're still just a child, Marco. You believed in them too much. Germans, Americans... they're all the same now! You never used to talk that way, Anna... Things were very different once. Now I'm scared. You're scared? Of what? You have Mattei, and the businessman with the money. What more do you want? If you don't want to leave with us, then go back home. Don't stay here. You disgust me, Anna. You all disgust me! Farewell, Marco. What should I say? Good luck. Marco... Elia ran away, but he won't get far. Lieutenant Nardi is looking for him. Look at him! Look at him, all of you! This is what happens to traitors. He can't even stand up. Make that coward stand up! Make him stand up! He has to die looking us in the eye! Elia... Elia, why did you do it? I told you, Marco, it didn't work out. - But at least I tried. - Elia... Forgive me. Go, Marco. Go. You've lost your babysitter. You'll have to go on alone now. But remember, it's never too late. Garrani, Laudato! Get back in line! Firing squad... Aim! Fire! Fire! Kill him! Kill him! Shoot me, guys! What are you waiting for? Marco! Shoot! Marco! Alright, let's get back to town. Second firing squad, march! Sing! Sing! Battalions, created from death for life. The games start in Spring, the world is in flames and flower. To win, we need Mussolini's lions, armed with velour! A red "M" is our destiny, a black ribbon for the fascist. We've seen death, with two bombs and a flower in our mouths! Germany was trapped. The Italian front was moving. Bologna rebelled and was liberated. Another slogan of Mussolini's: "The Valtellina will be our Thermopylae." And the last remaining soldiers were supposed to gather there, around their Duce. IF I ADVANCE FOLLOW ME IF I RETREAT KILL ME What is the Lieutenant doing? Hold on, I'll go see. - Lieutenant... - Get out! - But, Lieutenant, sir... - Get out! The fascist era is over for good. Attention, attention, I repeat! Benito Mussolini, captured as he tried to reach the Swiss border dressed as German soldier, was executed this morning in an as-of-yet unidentified location on the banks of Lake Como. The execution... Lieutenant! Lieutenant! The Valtellina... March! Well done, Laudato. Hey, let me have a drink. Marco. You were thinking about Elia, weren't you? Listen, Marco. I need you to do me a favour. In case... well, give this to my family, to remember me by. Don't be silly! - I can't go on, Lieutenant. - Come on, we're not far now. And now this fog... Stay together, compact now! Enough... enough! Enough, enough, enough... Go on, continue! Hide! Hide! Garrani! Return their fire! Shoot, shoot! Surrender! You're surrounded! Surrender and we will spare your lives! Put down your weapons! Surrender! Stay down, you cowards, or I'll kill you myself! Tomorrow we will attack. We will wipe them out! Beyond that crag is the Valtellina, and the others who are waiting for us. Come on, guys. Get some rest. It's Marco! What were you thinking? Garrani's beret. We have to send it to his family. I promised him. Italians! When they're about to die, they always talk about their family. But when somebody puts on this uniform, he's already buried his family long before. Everyone will be there in the Valtellina. Pavolini, Monterosa, Tagliamento. And we will fight. Because this is the path we've chosen. And we can't turn back now. Right, Marco? Marco! Marco! Come up here! Lieutenant! If you surrender, they'll spare you! Lieutenant, they've all left! All of them! We're all alone. Marco! It's over! It's over, Marco! Come up here! Marco! Marco! They captured Mussolini dressed as a German! They killed him! Come up here! Marco! Go on, Marco. They're calling you. Don't you hear them? Go on! Goodbye, Marco Laudato. Your sad illusion is over. Do you really plan to surrender to the people you called your enemies? Actually, you're going back to your country. Because, as Elia told you, your country was on the other side. On their side.
