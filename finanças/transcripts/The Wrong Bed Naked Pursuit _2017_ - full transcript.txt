It's all arranged. I've transferred the money into a new account. I'm ready to do this. We just need to wait a little longer. He doesn't suspect anything, does he? No, he's too busy with work to notice. I can't wait for this to finally be over. Me too, but I have to get back to the lab. And you gotta get outta here. I'll call you later. Everything's gonna be okay. I- I've changed my mind, I don't wanna be here anymore. I just wanna go home. You know I can't do that, Stella. It's gonna okay. You just have to trust me... Trust me. What are you doin' to me? Don't fight it, just try to relax... Relax. Owen, get up, we have to get out of here! Call security! Don't let them leave! Help! Help! Leave me alone! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Shh-shh. It's-it's-it's-it's it's okay, calm down. Hey, hey, hey. Shhh. Stop, please calm-calm- Where am I?! Help!! I have no idea what you're talking about-stop- please, please, please stop screaming. I'm not gonna say anything, okay? Just... Just let me go. You think I did this? Well, I don't remember how I got here. You obviously drugged me! Why are you doing this?! Look, all I know is I just woke up in bed next to a hysterical woman that I don't recognize with the worst headache of my life. You expect me to believe that? How do I know you didn't slip me something last night? That's... That's ridiculous. Why? Look, I-I-I don't know what you're trying to pull here, but I want you to get these handcuffs off me right now. Um... What makes you think these are mine? Do you see a key anywhere? No. Okay, okay. No. Nothing on my side either. Okay, umm, well... Right. These look like professional locks. Umm... How about a bobby pin or something? Maybe I can... Pick the lock? You sure know a lot about handcuffs and locks. Not really. I usually just kick the door down. Hey, hey look, you got it wrong, okay? I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm a fireman. I'm usually a... Dinner and a movie kind of guy. Well, I know for a fact that we did not have dinner. You remember that? No, you're just not my type. Now, if you wouldn't mind just focusing on getting these off so I can leave? Okay, okay. Umm... Where are we anyway? Well, it looks like you went all out. A three star hotel called the Pinewood Park on Aspen Road. Aspen Road? Alderville, New York. Alderville... Right, right. Okay, last thing I remember was leaving my sister Bethany's house. And that was what? Yesterday? What day is it today? I've no idea... Look, that's my phone over there, will you let me check? Yeah, sure. Okay, well... Right. Yeah. Umm... Okay, yeah, up on three? Mhm. One... Two, three. It says it's Thursday. I remember having breakfast with my friend Allie and then everything after that is just a blank. Stella. Stella, you're not going anywhere! Let go of me! You can't keep me here, Larissa! Okay, what just happened? I-I- I just remembered that there was a woman... Larissa. She was grabbing me and- and keeping me from leaving. Leaving where? I'm not sure. Do you mind if we...? Yeah-yeah-yeah. Sure. Umm... 'kay. And I... I'm guessing this belongs to you... Yes. Thank you. Need some help? No. I've got it, thanks. Okay. I can help you. Fine. Okay. Just get this... This... Sorry. I've been searching for them since they escaped last night, they just disappeared. What about their cells? It goes directly to voice mail. They're not gonna answer my calls. This is bad. We need to find them. Whatever it takes. Well, still don't see our shirts anywhere. Where could we have left them? Um, why don't we start over. What's your name? Well, not that we'll be together long enough to be on a first name basis, but it's Stella. Owen. Owen Michaels. Did you just remember something? It was-it was nothing. Are you sure? 'Cause it kinda looked like you... No. Um, why don't we, check the hallway for our shirts? 'Kay. Alright. Wait, who are you calling? I'm calling my friend Allie to see if maybe she can help us. I called Stella's work, she wasn't there. Reception's told me she was fired a month ago. I don't know where else to look! What do you want me to do? I don't know. Maybe talk to some of her friends, see if they know anything. Yes, ma'am. Hey, Allie, it's Stella. Can you call me back as soon as you get this? Thanks. I can't remember if she's working or not. She's a flight attendant for Trans Air. Didn't you say that-that you were visiting your sister? Could she help us? Yeah, but she's gonna be at work. And Bethany's a little uptight. I'd rather explain this one to her. Mhm. Great, my battery's almost dead. Wait a second, what is this? Okay, come on. Here. You okay? You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Here. Get over here. Okay. Okay. Whoever-whoever finds this... My name is Owen Michaels, this is Stella Williams. There's woman named Larissa who is trying to kill us. If we go missing, please take that to the authorities. Tell my mom I love her. Who is Larissa? That's-that's the woman that I remember. Where's my phone? Here. Maybe there's something on here that'll explain what's going on. My phone's dead. We should call the police. What? Do you hear the sirens in that video? Yeah... So? What if for some reason they're after us? But... Why? I dunno, let's just take a minute before we call the police. Well, what should we do now? Well, first thing: we need to get these things off. Then gotta retrace our steps. Figure out what happened last night. Hang on, I have a missed call. From who? I-I-I don't recognize the number, but it came in a half hour before that video and they didn't leave a message. Wait. Use the hotel phone. That way whoever it is won't know it's you. Larissa White. What? That was Larissa. We gotta find this key. Yes. Umm... Okay... Did you check in here? Yeah, I looked in there, have you checked all your pockets? Yes. Pinewood Park Hotel, how may I help you? Hi, do you have a Stella Williams staying with you? Sorry... Nobody here registered with that name. What about an Owen Michaels? Yes, shall I connect you? Would you mind telling me what room he's staying in? Nothing. Sorry, sorry. Umm... What about the couch? Do you think we were on the couch? I don't know... You know what I mean, I... Okay. You know what? Who you calling now? Maintenance, we have to get these cuffs off. Hi, could you send somebody up who can pick a lock? Perfect and how long will that be? Great, thank you. Sending somebody up right away. That was fast. That's Larissa! Owen, open up. I know you're in there. I just wanna talk to you. Excuse me! I seem to have locked myself out of my room could you... Actually, I probably shouldn't. You're gonna have to ask the reception. I'll do that. We have to get outta here. Yeah. Your phone... it's over there. Right. Okay. I think that's my jacket. What did she say? She just completely left me waiting for it and I had to stay there until 5, it's ridic- What's in here? What could we do with these? I got a few ideas... Is that blood? Is that blood? Blood... Sirens... Handcuffs? Actually I-I think the cuffs were mine. What? The guys at the station must have slipped them into my pocket as a joke. Thanks. I'm just worried that he's done something to hurt himself, so-I just... Appreciate it. We gotta get out of here. Can we take a cab to your place? My keys are in my purse. Okay. Go to my sister's, it's a bit of a ways out. I'm hoping there's something in the garage we can use to get these cuffs off. I really appreciate it, I'm just so worried, he's been acting really strange lately. I just hope we're not too late. He's not in there... I guess he must be okay after all. Thank you. Come on. Over here. Owen, Stella, wait! Owen, Stella, wait! Sorry. I'm waiting for the Amirs. Yep that-that's us! Go. Dammit! Hello? Larissa, it's Dr.Jamison. I'm here with Dr. Cooper. Is everything okay? Well, that's what we wanna know... Where are you? I'm... I had a personal errand I had to run. I'm on my way back now. Please come see us when you get in. I hope everything went okay last night. We can't afford any surprises at this stage. You mean you can't afford any surprises. You're as much a part of this as I am, Mitch. I hope you don't ever forget that. Look, I'm sure everything's going to be fine, Ben. You always manage to get what you want, I can't see how this would be any different. Wow, this is really something. So this is your- your sister's place? We both grew up here. And Beth decided to keep the house after my parents died. There should be something here I can use to get these off. So it's just the two of you? Now yes. This should work! You really think that's gonna work? Trust me. So you like to be in control? Sometimes. No, no... Now you're stuck with me. You say that like it's a bad thing. There you go. You're free of me, you got your wish. Told you you could trust me. Well, I'm just not very good at trusting. Why's that? You okay? Let me see. I can put something on that if you want. Then I can make you something to eat. I don't know about you, but I'm starvin'. Come on. You wanted to see me, Dr. Jamison? I was wondering why you didn't finish your report last night. It got late... I thought I'd finish up this morning, but everything went well... I can't afford any mistakes, Larissa. There's already been too many. I understand. I can assure you that everything's under control. Good. That's all I wanted to hear. Here you go. Wow. A fireman and a chef. Not just a pretty face. We take turns cooking back at the station. How long have you been a fireman? Eleven years. I started off doing it here for a year, and then I transferred to Boulder after... After? Let's just say I needed a change of scenery. So what about you? What's your story? Umm, well, I was born and raised here. Most of my friends left after college, but I stayed on to help my mom. And umm... It was just us for a long time, then she moved to Florida to be closer to my grandmother. And your father? He left when I was little. So, what do you do for work? Up until a month ago, I was a claims adjuster for an insurance company. Was? Mhm. What, did you get bored? No, no. I got fired for telling my boss where to go when he denied a claim for a five-year-old boy who had cancer. He said it was a "pre-existing condition". Wow. That's Lilly... That's my younger sister. That's the, last good picture we have of her before she got sick. She was, diagnosed with leukemia the summer of her sophomore year and... Five months later she was gone. I'm so sorry. Looks like we have got something in common after all. Owen? Is that you? Hey, Beth. There you are! I was worried about you when you didn't come home last night. Where have you been? And why isn't your car out front? Hi, I'm Bethany, Owen's sister. Hi, Stella. Hi. This is my big sister, Bethany. Let me get this for ya. Thank you. No problem. I'll see if my phone is charged yet. Well, nice to meet you, Stella. You too. Yeah, I just reviewed the security footage. They broke into Dr. Cooper's office and stole some of his files. I need to get those back. So, how long have you known Owen? Not long. Where'd you guys meet? It's kind of a long story. You know what? I'm just happy he's dating again. Because between you and me... I was getting a little worried. Owen doesn't really, let anyone get too close to him since our little sister, Lilly, died. He was always the protective big brother and when Lilly got sick, he did everything he could to help. He thinks he failed her, so he just kinda threw himself into his work. How long ago was that? Well, that would have been five years ago on Saturday. Yeah. Wow. He comes back every year at this time so we can go to the cemetery together. So are you from around here? Yeah, yeah, I'm from Alderville. You're local! Wow, that's great, I've been trying to get Owen to move back to town for years, so... Maybe you'll have more luck. Listen, I know my brother can seem a little rough around the edges... He's a really good man. Anyway, it's really nice to meet you, make yourself at home, I'm just gonna run a few errands. Okay, thanks. No problem. Hey, gonna wanna see this. I must have put her contact info in my phone last night. Didn't you say you had a friend named Allie who worked for Trans Air? Yeah, but how would you know her? I don't. I called her around midnight last night. And there's more... Is he still there? Go, go, go! Wh-what is that, a bowling alley? Looks like it. What were we doing there? I have no idea. What's going on, Larissa? What do you mean? Larissa, we've known each other for years, I can tell when there's something wrong. Now come on, we've always been honest with each other and If you need to talk, or... If you need some help... I just want you to know that I'm here. I don't understand. Why would we go to a bowling alley if someone was chasing us? I don't know, maybe we were trying to lose her? Well, let's go. Where? I really hope someone in there's gonna have some answers. Yeah. Hey, hey... Look... I don't want any more trouble here. I'm sorry? You have a lot of nerve coming in here after what you did last night. We're just hoping you'll help us tell us what happened. Get out, or I'll call the cops! I don't understand. Did we do something to upset you? Are you kidding me? Where's security?! Dr. Cooper... I'm so sorry, I don't understand what happened. One minute everything's going the way that it usually does and then the next, the patients are acting delusional and paranoid. I called security, but they were so agitated I couldn't stop them from leaving. Leaving? I spent all last night and this morning looking for them... But we couldn't find them. This could jeopardize everything. Yes, it could. Dr. Cooper. There's something else... The security footage, I reviewed it. It looks like they broke into your office and stole some of your files. My files? Which files? I don't know. I couldn't tell from the footage. Larissa. It-it's Joey, right? Listen, the truth is we're both having a little trouble remembering anything about last night. So can you just tell us what happened? You mean besides clearing out my business? And this? I did that? This was the other guy. What other guy? The one with the other girl you came in with... Do you-do you happen to remember her name? I didn't have time to introduce myself. The whole place went to hell when you started screaming. I shoulda trusted my instinct. The way your were all acting, I shoulda kicked you out when you first came in here! Nice driving there, brother! We're not even bowling yet. Hold on, wait a minute. You know what you cost me in lost business?! Never mind scuffing up my lanes with your street shoes! Hey, hey! You need to wear bowling shoes if you're gonna play here. He's so mad! So mad! He's got a gun! Look. Come on over here. Yeah, this is, everything I got. For the damages. Okay, so we know we were with an other couple. An other couple? You know what I mean. It's locked! Come on, Allie! Come on! What? Come on. We were with Allie... Your friend Allie? Yeah. Yeah! And-and we were in that car. And we were being chased by somebody with a gun. Do you think that's why she didn't call me back? Come on. It's locked. That's my purse... And that's my overnight bag. Mine's in there too... Well, why would we have our overnight bags? What are you doing? Gonna look inside. See if there's something I can find might give us some answers. Well... Here's one mystery solved. Yeah, but why didn't he come back for his car? Maybe he doesn't remember anything either. What are those? I dunno, any idea? Looks like old medical forms. Here. Okay, this says the car's registered to Tony R. Carter, 387 Palawan Lane. Do you think he still lives there? Only one way to find out. Allie's my best friend. I don't know what I would do if anything happened to her. Look, I'm sure she's fine. We made it to the hotel, they probably just jumped in a taxi after they realized Tony left his keys in the car. Yeah, you're probably right, she probably just didn't get my messages 'cause her phone was off. Yeah. Have you found them yet? This needs to be handled now! Hey, stranger... Allie. Ooh, I must have had too much wine. My head is throbbing. Do you have any coffee? I don't really remember much from last night. Here, let me remind you. That feels amazing... Tony. Tony. Well, has anyone ever told you that you have magic hands, Tony? Maybe once or twice. Stay here, I'll be right back. Mhm. Hello. Knock, knock. Emily, what are you doing here? I heard it's finally done! You- God, I need you... It's been too long. No, no, no. Not here, not here. I'm tired of sneaking around, when are we gonna tell him? No. We need to wait until after we finish this study. No, you said it yourself, that's just paperwork. Listen, I can't risk anything interfering with the study. Okay? I've worked too hard for this. I just wanna wait for the right time to tell him. When exactly is the "right time" to tell your partner that you're sleeping with his wife? Emily, we talked about this and we agreed we need to wait until after the FDA approval. You're not going to say anything to him are ya? Hey, Emily... Are you? Don't worry... My lips are sealed. Wait, wait are you sure we should just go in? Isn't that breaking and entering? Well, technically it's not breaking and entering if you have a key. But what if Tony doesn't remember us? It's open. Hello? Tony? Is this seat taken? No, feel free. My god. Tony Carter. Nice to meet you. Allie... Allie Anderson. What? I... I think we met Tony at some sort of medical office. Hey... This is Allie's necklace. She must have come back here with Tony last night. It's still cold. Where could they have gone? Well, maybe he remembered he left his car at the bowling alley last night. Let's wait. Maybe they'll come back. Well, what do we know so far? Well, apparently we, met at a medical facility, went bowling with Allie and Tony, and someone is chasing us. I just can't figure out how it all connects, can you? No. I can't make sense of it either. Tony? Wait. What if it's not them? Tony? Allie? Is that you? Tony, it's Owen and Stella, we wanna talk to you. That scared the hell out of me. It's okay, it's just a broom. Stay here! Somebody's upstairs! Tony! Hey! Who was that? I don't know. Whoever it was took off. Can we get outta here now, please? My god. No, no, no, no. Allie? Allie? I'm so sorry. What's happened to them? Colour of the skin, it looks like they were poisoned. I don't understand! I don't know why somebody would wanna do this! We-we need to call the police! Wait a minute. What are you doing? Maybe we can find something. What is that? It's a parking ticket. Dated last night. I- I recognize this address, it's not far from here. Yeah. Maybe it'll give some answers. Hey. What? What if this has something to do with why Tony and Allie were murdered? Let's go. Emily. Wh-what are you doing here? I was just asking Ben where you'd gotten to. You shoulda told me you were here, I would've cancelled my meeting. Well, can't a wife surprise her husband? I feel like I never see you anymore. You're always working so late. Well, the trial's almost over and... We'll spend more time then. I promise. But we have a lot more work to do. Alright, I can take a hint. I will put a plate in the fridge for you. Great. That's my truck. Let's grab our stuff. I don't think it's a good idea for us to keep driving Tony's car. I can't believe you're gonna spend the 500 bucks on a pair of boots. I'm gonna be paying bills, since they're starting to pile up since I got fired. Stella, you did the right thing. Thanks for doing this with me. You're such a good friend. That's what best friends are for. What? Did you remember something? Came here with Allie... I just can't believe she's gone. We're gonna figure out who did this. I promise. Come on. Here. Alright, let's go. Okay, here. ACPI Labs. That's the same logo that was on Tony's files. Should we go? Yeah. But let's be careful. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. We were here... I was sitting there and- and you were over there, and Tony and Allie, they were right here. Are they closed, or? If you're here to sign up for the sleep study, I'm afraid we're not taking any more subjects. That's too bad. We, were hoping to participate. Well, we got a variety of trials that happen throughout the year. I could have you fill out an intake form and we could keep your name on file. Sure, yeah. That'd be great. Great. Just give me a moment, let me see if I can find them. You sure this is the right place? Yeah. What, do you think he recognized us? Here we go. Okay. What was the sleep study for again...? Danzoset. It's a new drug therapy that we've developed to help people who suffer from severe sleep disorders. Right. Um, I almost forgot. My friend, um, she was here last night for the study and, she wanted me to ask to see if she left her cell phone here. She seems to have m-misplaced it. What's her name? Allie. Allie Anderson. Let me check the back, see if anyone turned in a phone. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea... I think we should go. Just try to relax... Relax. Stella, you're not going anywhere! Let go of me! You can't keep me here, Larissa! That's Larissa. We have to go. Right now. Security! Don't let them leave the building. Larissa? What's going on? They're here! Come on. You go that way. Okay. Go, go, go! I think they went that way! Hey! You. That security guard, I remember him, he was chasing us. Larissa was injecting us with some sort of drug, do you think that's why we can't remember anything? I just don't understand what they want from us! I feel like I'm going crazy, I'm so tired. Look, we gotta get somewhere safe. Somewhere we can rest, think. Your sister's place? No, I have an other idea. What is going on?! I don't understand. Those were two of the test subjects from last night's study who broke into Dr. Cooper's office and stole some of his files. Why is this the first I'm hearing about it?! Um... I just don't know who I can trust anymore. You can trust me. Look, I'm really sorry for what I said back at the hotel. I shouldn't have judged you like that. It's okay. Look, it wasn't exactly a usual situation. It's not everyday you wake up handcuffed to a handsome fireman. We should be safe here. You okay? Come on, let's get inside where it's warm. Make yourself at home. I'll get a fire started. This place is really nice. Thanks. Yeah, we came here a lot when we were kids. A lot of good memories. It was Lilly's favorite place. From what Bethany tells me you and Lilly were really close. Yeah. Yeah, Lilly and I, we were... We were a lot alike. She was a funny kid. She could always make me laugh. And she looked up to me. I guess in her mind I was... Some kind of superhero. It's taken me a long time to come to terms with her not being here. Is that why you became a Firefighter? Maybe. Trying to live up to her expectations, I guess. I'll see if I can find some food. And the bathroom's there if you wanna freshen up. Thank you. No problem. Yes, this is Larissa White at ACPI Labs. One of your taxis picked up two of our patients at the Pinewood Park Hotel this morning. I need to know where they took them. Great, thank you. Dr. Jamison. Larissa, what do you need? There's a Detective Harrison to see you. A detective? It seems two of the test subjects are dead. It seems two of the test subjects are dead. This is Detective Harrison from Alderville PD. This is Dr. Cooper and Dr. Jamison. Hey. As I mentioned earlier, Dr. Jamison is running the sleep trial. Ms. White tells me that Allie Anderson and Tony Carter were two of your test subjects. Yes, that's correct. We found their bodies at Tony Carter's house after we received an anonymous tip. My god. What happened? We don't know yet. We're expecting some answers when the autopsy reports come in, but in the meantime, we were hoping that you'd have some information that might help us. Larissa, If I'm not mistaken, weren't those two of the test subjects that elected to leave the study early last night? Yes, that's right. Tony and Allie chose to leave the program. In fact, they left with two other participants last night. Can I get the names of these other two people they left with? Owen Michaels and Stella Williams. Larissa, didn't you mention that you had to call security because of how aggressive they were acting? When you say aggressive, what do you mean exactly? I mean, they were acting really strange, really agitated. I tried to talk to them to make sense of what was going on, but they ran off... A little bit later that's when security alerted me to the fact that they broken into Dr. Cooper's office. And that's when Owen had attacked, Rick, our security guard. Why do you think they would've done that? I think it could've been a side effect from the study. No. We haven't seen any side effects in any of our test subjects from any of our trials we've conducted. If there had been side effects, we would've seen 'em by now. The only thing I can think of is that they might have been sent by a rival pharmaceutical company. Do you think I could, have a look at their files? Sure. Yes, of course. I mean, anything to help. I noticed you have, security cameras. Think you can pull last night's footage for me as well? Sure. Yeah. Right this way. Should really have something to eat. I can't. I just... I feel like there's something that we're missing. I know. But we're gonna figure this out together. It's just... Allie's dead... And we can't even remember anything that could help. None of this makes any sense. Hey, I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. God, you're beautiful. I haven't felt this close to someone in a very long time. Me too. I don't understand... But it looks like some of the security footage from last night is missing. I'm telling you, she's lying. Did you see all those vials? And the needles? What kind of sleep study is this? We should leave. We can't. We gotta figure out what's goin' on. We can't let them do it to somebody else. Okay, okay. Um, you and Tony stand guard and-and we'll take a look around and see what we can find. Okay. There has to be something in here that'll explain what they're doing. Did you see the size of that needle?! This isn't a sleep study! Maybe they work for the government? Some sort of mind control experiment? Did you notice that-that there's cameras everywhere? We have to be careful. Hey, hey, look at this. What is it? It-it's a bank statement for someone named Emily Cooper. Looks like she's been transferring a lot of money out of this account. Well, what do you think it means? I don't know... Hey. Look at this. Chemical compound for something called Tryzoban? This doesn't seem like a sleep study to me. Hurry up, I think I hear someone coming! Let's go! What? I need to see the files from Tony's car. Hi. What's wrong? The police were here. Umm... Two of our test subjects were found dead this morning. What are you talking about? How? I don't know, but they've opened a formal investigation. When word gets out about this, it'll ruin everything... Here... This. Look at this. I-I think whoever's after us, this is what they want. What is Tryzoban? That's where you are... What did you do?! Listen to this: "Tryzoban was pulled by the FDA just days prior to it's official release after the promising new anti-depressant was found to cause severe side-effects including: mood swings, paranoia, drastically impaired impulse control along with severe memory loss." "In high dosages the drug also resulted in psychosis and death. In light of this development, ACPI Labs will now move all its resources to Dr. Jamison's Danzoset sleep study." When's that article dated? A year ago. This Tryzoban document is dated last week. You're gonna be getting a little drowsy, and then you may experience some side effects, but it's nothing to worry about. You'll be safe here. Memory loss, lowered inhibitions... They're still testing Tryzoban. What? What're you talking about? I just talked to Ben, he said the police were here- that two of your test subjects are dead! Yes, terrible isn't it? This could shut down the entire study! Yeah. Yeah, it could. Please tell me you didn't do anything stupid, Mitch. What? You want him to fail, don't you? Because of what he did to you- You don't know what you're talking about. Don't I? When I was tidying up at home, I found a vial of Tryzoban in with your things. You said that they were all destroyed when they shut down your study! Well, I-I-I must have overlooked a vial. You gave it to them, didn't you? This is-this is crazy. You have always been jealous of him, but this? Okay, look. All those years, our life together, you're gonna give it all up for him? I know about the bank statements. I know about the money transfers. How could you do this? Why? All our years together?! Years of me waiting... Night after night. For you to come home. Fifteen years of me waiting for you to put me first, before your work. Never happened! So you know what? I finally decided... I deserve better. Don't do this. You're absolutely right. No matter what you try, you will never be half the man that Ben is... No, don't say that... I'm gonna tell him. Okay, wait! I did it for us, okay? For us. I'm gonna tell him to tell the police exactly what to look for: the side effects of the Tryzoban. You disgust me! Dr. Cooper? Dr. Cooper? Can I talk to you? What's going on? I'm not sure, but the door's locked and Dr. Cooper's not answering. Doesn't usually lock his door... Emily! Emily! Emily! No, no! My god! No! Okay, she still has a pulse. Call an ambulance! Call an ambulance!! I need an ambulance to the ACPI Laboratory Building. Yeah. Rick. I know where they are. We have to call the police. It's Bethany. Hello. Hey, sorry, I just wanted to know if you were coming home for dinner. No, I-I'm going to be staying at the, cabin tonight. How romantic. I guess things are going pretty well. Hang on, someone's at the door. Bethany? Hi, can I help you? I'm looking for Owen Michaels. Bethany, who's at the door? Sorry, I didn't get your name. Bethany? What? Hey! Bethany?! Beth! Beth! Bethany?! Bethany, are you there? Bethany? I don't know where you are, but you and Stella have one hour to get me the file. You contact the police and your sister ends up like your friends. Bethany? You contact the police and your sister ends up like your friends. What? They have Bethany. I have one hour to get him these files. No, no. We have to call the police. No, I can't. If I do, he's gonna killer. You should stay here. No, I'm coming with you! You don't have to do this... She's my sister. Just let me help you, okay? We stand a better chance with two of us. I don't want you getting hurt. I'm not letting you go in there by yourself. Okay. Ready? Stay close. Beth!! Beth. Beth? She's alive. Beth. Now you give me what I want, and your sister will be fine. Drop it. Do it or I shoot her. Okay, okay. What did you do to my sister? I just gave her a little something to help her sleep. Now give me the files. Why are you doing this? You shouldn't have broken into my office. 'Cause I had the whole thing worked out. You and your friends made a real mess. You killed Tony and Allie? I had no choice... They wouldn't tell me where my files were. So you overdose them on Tryzoban. Is that what you gave Bethany? Hello. Hi, I'm Dr. Cooper from the Denzoset sleep study, I just came by to see how you're doing. May I come in? It'll only take a few minutes. Sure, I guess it would be okay. Thank you. Hello? Allie? Tryzoban? No. You know I begged him to give me more time so I could find out what the side effects of Tryzoban were. He wouldn't listen. Dr. Jamison shut me down. You know he took everything from me? My study, my reputation, my wife... I just wanted to ruin his study. And I just wanted him to feel... The same humiliation that I felt. But then you and your friends took my files and everything got outta control. And I had no choice. So I OD'd them on Denzoset. Jamison's drug. Give me the file. Now. If you want them so badly, then take them! Now look what you made me do! You shouldn't have done that! Leave her alone. I'm afraid it's too late for that. Stella? Come back! Stella? Stella? Come on. Don't run away from me. Just let me explain. Stella? You Bitch! My god! What happened? Don't you come near me! Larissa... Larissa... Thank God you're here. I found them... I need you. Shut up! Don't move! Okay, please. Don't shoot, I just came to help you! What? No, no, no-I-I I don't believe you, you're working together. You're the one who was injecting us! Dr. Cooper switched the vials. He gave you Tryzoban instead of Danzoset. He wanted there to be side effects. You need to believe me, I had nothing to do with that. But you-you- you were chasing us! I just wanted to make sure that you were okay. I called the police... We found Emily. She's still alive. Emily... And I'm sure she'll have a lot to say once she regains consciousness. Put the gun down! That's him, right there. Right there. Owen! My sister... Larissa, take care of my sister, she's... We need an ambulance. Now. You okay? Yeah, somebody's gonna be here soon, it's okay. It's nice to see you again. I wanted to come by and congratulate you. I read in the paper that Danzoset finally got FDA approval. I'm glad something good eventually came out of all of this. You know, it wasn't your fault... No... Not directly. How's Emily? She moved back to Chicago to be with her family. What about you? I applied to med school. I thought I might try and do some good of my own. That's great. I'm really happy for you, Larissa. You deserve it. Thanks. Take care, Doctor. Okay, so what about all this stuff? No, gotta keep that. You can't keep everything. Don't worry. We'll have enough room for your stuff. You two almost done? I just don't know how we're gonna fit all this stuff in a two bedroom apartment. Well this is almost everything I was storing for you. I just wish you'd reconsider and move back home. I know, but Stella has a great job opportunity in Colorado. And I've always loved working with kids, so I think the school district's gonna be a really good fit for me. I'm really happy for you guys. And I've got more boxes in the garage, so I'm gonna grab those... 'Kay. Hang on a second... What are these? You started young? I wonder what we could do with these... No. Come on. I don't think so. You're stuck with me now.
