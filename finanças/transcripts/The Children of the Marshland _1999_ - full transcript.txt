What I'm doing is no good. I wanted to keep some for you, but then I thought you did not want any. Had I known you wanted some, you know me. I know I didn't collect much, but there's no lily of the valley around here. Or maybe just some scrawny ones. Garris, wait! - You're a real bastard. - I didn't want, I swear! You could at least have kept the bottle, it was returnable. - I'll go back to get it. - No, it's almost 12. Don't walk so fast. You need a lift? Thanks, we won't say no. For sure, we won't say no. How old are you, son? 35. My son would be your age, had he not died at Verdun. Were you in the war too? What's the matter? - My friend does not like that. - Like what? Like to speak of that bloody war. What are you going to do with all these lilies? Sell it. Tomorrow is May 1st. People complain life is expensive, and they buy flowers. For all you know, your lilies will make you more money than my potatoes. Lilies bring luck, potatoes don't. Thanks, you can drop us here. - Thanks for your trouble - See you. Your Pamela is gone, stop thinking about her. Come on Don't torture yourself; what's the use. We must be in a good mood tonight. We're not going to sing "De Profundis"! You're right. We'll sing 'May' and make 100 francs more than last year. Let's go Shit! Shit! Shit! I told you a 100 times to stop this. But there's a wasp hive! I don't care! Beat it! Cri-Cri, don't dirty your dress. I've already washed it twice this week. I've always wondered why my first memories are of that particular spring. Must be the same for everyone. You have memories of before, of course. How are you, little girl? but you're too young, they are only fragments, scattered images. Then, when you are 4 or 5, suddenly, it's like you really exist. Everything stays with you forever. Many years later, you can tell it like a story. I was about to turn 5. Very few lilies, huh Garris! Your friend with the big bicycle came and left a roast chicken on the table. - Can we have some? - Shut up. He also said that if you are ok with it, he'll go sing with you. My goodness! If Am?d?e comes along, they won't throw coins, they'll throw buckets of water instead! Bloody Am?d?e. Such a nice guy. - So can we have some chicken? - Yes, yes, you'll get your chicken. Go! In life, to have what you want, you must work. Never forget that. Either that, or steal from people. And me, Henry Pignolle, I don't want my children to become thieves. Understood? Well said, right? Not bad. Read it in your book or came up with it on your own? On my own. In my book it says: "Never force your children to work, otherwise they may get used to it" Our father ever read only one book an old almanach from 1921 he used to go through constantly, He knew it by heart. Let's go kids, your mother will worry. Jojo! Take this. Give her this one, tell her it's from your father - And from you too? - If you want. At times I ask myself why I've stayed here 12 years. Listening to the devil that prevents me from leaving. - I don't understand. - Is that so? What about me? What about the kids? What would become of us? You're not gonna leave us, right, Garris? You're not gonna leave us. You're not feeling well? No not too good. Don't stay out in the cold, come inside. I cast some lines in the pond. They need to be reeled in. I'll go. Where are they? The dog will guide you. Go, doggie. Good, you have something? Nice eel. Put it in the back. You can sell it if you want. You'll get good money for it. No, we'll eat it tomorrow. You need to regain our strength I don't know how to gut it I'll show you how, if you stay for a while. 2 or 3 days. I'll leave once you feel better. But I am not sick! I have never once been sick my entire life! I'm 92, that's all. That's my sickness. Thanks for staying. It's my pleasure. Listen, if you're hungry, there's bread and cheese in the cabbard. - Take whatever you want. - I don't mind The eel. there's too much for two of us. Tomorrow you'll go and give half to Riton Who is Riton? A guy who lives a bit further, in the other hut. His wife is never in a hurry to cook Always combing her hair, pampering herself, a vain one. Poor Riton! He's happy like that. Every morning, as long as he can look at his Pamela, all is well. Where do you come from? I got my army release in February. You've been walking ever since? To go where? I don't know. Here and there. It's a beautiful country. But one day, you have to settle down. Here. you'd be good, you'd be free. No need to sleep in other people's houses I'll leave you my hut, and my boat. The swamp. can still feed a man for a long time. I always had all I needed here Never been the servant of anyone She left me! Pam?la She left. Where's the old man? He left too. Come on, it's getting late. Let's not make Am?d?e wait. I'm coming! Let's get moving. Your sister gives me the creeps. Come, Come. You know. Ad?le is not mean, just a bit mad that's all. Her fianc? Bruno went off to war in 1916, never came back. Since then everytime someone walks in front of the house, she thinks he's back. One sec, one of my feet is killing me. Shit! Feeling better? Yes, feels good. Tell me, Am?d?e, may I ask you a question? Nothing's indiscreet between us. Your father and you, how long since you stopped talking to each other? 5 or 6 years. But since he hardly spoke before, except to criticise me, not a big loss. That's not what I'm after. Why is it you don't talk to each other anymore? A stupid quarrel. I'll tell you one day. Where are you planning to sing 'the May song' to the people this year? Around here. You mean in my neighborhood? In that case, I really cannot join you. - I'm sorry. - No problem. Let's go, Riton. You know, we come here because people are rich. We did not think it would cause you a problem of pride. of dignity. The rich are not the ones giving most. The rich give to get rid of us They prefer if we yell elsewhere, get on other people's nerves. Let's go. Listen, Am?d?e. I'm telling you it's no bother, we know you're a friend. By the way, we didn't even thank you for the chicken. Ah, yes, that chicken was really delicious. It's nothing. Listen, may I offer some advice? If you pass by the bank manager's house, avoid it, he's a real mean one. You'll recognise it easily, a big white house. He hates noise. He's got a 2-meter-tall black butler A mean Senegalese nicknamed Banania. A negro? I don't like that. Let's go. At night all men are black. Daddy is doing the horse. Daddy does the dog. Here comes the beautiful month of May, when gallant men plant the May seeds, I will plant one just for my love, It will be prettier than. Shut up, Shut up! And now, beat it! 1 Franc! Deserves a second song. No, no, for Christ sake. I'm paying you to shut up. Give him his money back. No, keep it. Please understand, my baby just went to sleep; I'm alone. My wife went to her grandfather's funeral. Ah, that's why. We apologize. Thanks. We hope the little one will sleep well. Yes, me too. Good bye. Good night. Good. I close the gate. Let's go - One, Two, - Just one sec. I'd like to let you know that you don't emphasize 'May' enough. - What do you mean? - We sing May, so you must stress 'May'. Here comes the beautiful month of May. May. Agreed? Anybody there? Apologies madam. We came to sing May. That's very good. That's a fading tradition. Please sing ahead. It brings luck. Here comes the beautiful month of May. It's true it's May already. How time flies! Keep quiet and listen. They're dragging too much on 'May' In my day we did not sing it that way. Keep quiet and listen. Do you have anything? We got no small change. Never mind, you'll give next year. If we're still around. You can pay us in kindl. What a great ideia. 3 eggs and a bottle of good wine. Good. This is bad manners. What will they think of us? Dtop drinking. I'm clearing my voice. Yeah, right. Drunkard. Look, an open gate - this is strange. Looks like no one is in - Let's take a look. - Stop it. - Don't be an idiot - Comne on. It's open. What is this all about? You must have left a light on. Impossible, I never forget. They would deduct from my salary, they've done it before. Maybe your bosses are back. No, not until Tuesday. I must go. It's almost 12. Maybe there are thieves? Have you seen thieves in those parts? Listen, Marie. I ran off to come see you. If I'm not back before 12, I'll be found out. Say good-bye, please! Goo-bye, please. Stop! Stay away from me! Don't be afraid, Miss. Let me explain. We were about to leave. Right, Garris? Your manners. Hat off in front of a lady. Sorry. We were passing by, we saw the gate wide open; it seemed strange so we came in to investigate, You understand? My friend and I are singing the May in the neighborhood tonight, to bring people luck. That's as simple as that. I remind you that you must take your hat off in front of a lady. I am not a lady, I am the maid. My bosses are in Nice til Tuesday. They don't tell me what they're up to. They're not very kind to you. Neither kind or unkind. They are bosses. You guys really gave me a good scare. Especially you. I'm sorry. Won't happen again. Could I have a bit of wine to recover from my emotions? ?Riton! - You are pushing your luck. - But of course you can! The wine is mine. I get one bottle a week but I don't drink much. See? Why must you always shame me in front of people! Glasses are on top. Take three. Some wine will do me good tool. Sit down. - Do you live in town? - No, the swamp. If you were to pass through, it would be nice to come visit us. It's possible, why not? Seriously, it would make us happy. Have you been here for long? 2 years. It's my first job. I won't do this forever, though. Study, for instance. Por ejemplo, asistir a unas clases. Become a hairdresser. Work in a big salon, in a big town. With lots of people and buses. Because here. I'd cut women's hair like Jean Harlow's - Do you know about Jean Harlow? - No. I went to see her in a movie tonight. You cannot imagine. Magnificient. Really magnificient. She's my favourite actress. I'm probably boring you - Am I boring you? - No. Not at all, on the contrary. Cheers! That's right. Cheers. Listen, I've had enough. My feet are killing me, and we're not going to wake up people at 1?m! That girl is real nice. I'm talking to you, Don Juan. I agree the girl is nice, and pretty, and whatever, but if we don't stop now, people will not throw water but camber pots instead. She promised to come see us Promised, promised. She said maybe. - I agree with you she'll come - You think so? When a woman says 'maybe', it's for sure If she says 'promised', it's not even maybe, it's never. - I should really read your book one of these days. - You said it. How much did we make? I've told you 3 times already. 87 francs and 40 cents, plus the eggs from the old hag. That's how much. We said we would aim for at least 100 francs. This guy is wide awake. Here's our opportunity. But it's a white house. - So what? - It's the bank manager's house. Did you forget? The big Senegalese; the cannibal Am?d?e told us about. I've known many Senegalese Entire regiments of them, and I've never met a cannibal. Or maybe my mind was elsewhere. Come on See, the banker is just like me; his feet are killing him. Philosophe! My slippers, my medecine, my camomile tea. Here, sir. I've waited a long time for sir, ready to intervene. What a lousy night! 3 hours standing, ancient foie-gras, tepid champagne, wrinkled old hags. I'm exhausted, Philosophe. Poor sir. Wear your slippers, you will feel better. What on earth is this circus? Out, get off my property! Beat it! Are you mad? What's wrong with you? Philosophe, get rid of this scum! I don't want to hear them any more! Banania! Listen, my friend meant no harm. Don't get mad, we're leaving. It's true, we're leaving! You're on your way, Mister high and mighty. With a big kick on your small white ass. You won't be able to sit down ever again. - Garris! - I'm going to eat you! I'm going to eat you! Stop laughing, man. It's dumb to laugh at someone who's afraid. You must have been scared sometime too. Maybe scared to death for 4 years, like me. I was just laughing at him running his ass off. Please, whitey. 5 francs. Way too much. My boss his paying. I'll tell him I gave you 10. Marne! Vimy! Somme! What about you, man? Villers Cotterets, Verdun! The war! this dirty war, this shit war! my good man. He chased me almost all the way here, but I managed to lose him. He didn't even go beyond the gate. We made 92 Francs and 40 cents. I counted again. Aren't those the banker's slippers? I'm never as dumb as people think. That's where my strength lies. There, with the slippers we're easily over the 100 francs mark. Come, we've got to get some sleep. Tomorrow morning we're selling the lilies. Her name is Marie. - Who told you? - She did. I asked her. I told you, I'm not as dumb as I look. This head is not empty. Hello, my friend! - How's things? - Good, as you can see. If all goes well, I'll be finished in an hour. Sell me some happiness. No, not you. Yes, please, it's for a gift. It's for an old lady I'm very fond of. She grows beautiful rose bushes. - Riton is not with you? - He's doing the church exit. - Shall we see each other later? - Whenever you want, Am?d?e. 1'25 franc! Happiness for the whole year! Look, it's Sardi, the French champion! How much for the lot? I've got to check, buddy. Not 'buddy'. Sir. Do you know who you're talking to? Jo Sardi. That's me. 20 francs, ok? Mireille! Oh, Jo! The rest is for the people here. Ladies and gentlemen, a gift of happiness from Jo Sardi. Jo Sardi defends his title tonight. Come and see him fight, come on time, come in numbers It won't last long Is that ok? Sure, buddy. Everybody believes in love, the one that lasts forever. But one day you go back to your hut, and there you are, it's over. Pam?la has flown the coop. Thomas, hit me again - the same. Listen, friend, don't you think you've had enough by now? No. Not enough to forget. I warn you, this is the last one. In the beginning, I thought: "Impossible, she'll come back". Cos she loved her Riton, Pam?la. Don't think she didn't. For someone who sells happiness, he's not very cheerful. Jo! How are you? Sit down here. Order whatever you want. What will it be, Miss Mireille? A Suze-Cassis for me. For Jo, the usual. Suze-Cassis and Vittel-strawberry. On the way. Fortunately there was Garris. Without him, I would have killed myself a long time ago. He's been a real brother to me. A real brother to me! Friend, could you keep it down a bit? You are disturbing a young lady. A young lady? Yes, you are disturbing a young lady indeed. Where is she? There. Pam?la! I am not Pam?la. You are Pam?la. Pam?la! - Leave me alone. - My princess, my love! Leave me alone! Let go of me! -Shit. I call you back Let go of me! Let go of me! You know him? Of course not. Can't you see he's drunk! Don't listent to him! Your ass back on that chair! Jo, champion! Felix, my Vittel-strawberry. Where is that peasant? Take that! Hillbilly! Hick! I'm gonna show you who's the hillbilly! Jo! Enough! Come on, hillbilly! Come on! Shit! My table! Not my chairs! Let go, I'm gonna kill him! Let's get the hell out of here. You're nothing but a peasant you are! Let's go. Don't run or you'll get noticed. My cap, I forgot my cap! We don't give a shit about your cap. Walk on, we must get away from here. Don't give a shit? I've had it for 10 years, and it was a gift from Pam?la. You are a drunk and and imbecile. Shut up! I thought I saw Pam?la, that's all. Pam?la is gone forever. Forget her. You have a good woman now, Emillie, she takes good care of your kids. Yes, she's a good woman, but Pam?la was a princess. No empeores las cosas. ?Jo, no seas gilipollas! Wait. there's a big one right here. Got it. I got one. Have you seen your father and Garris? They're over there, walking fast. - They are going home. - Shut up! They are going home. I'll try to catch up. Can I come with you? You don't play a fool like last time ok? - You ok? - yes. How can I forget that day? I can still feel the sun on my skin. I swear I can still smell the perfume of those roses. I saw Marie. - When? Where? - Around 11?m. Outside the church. - She did not see me. - How was she? On foot. That's not what I'm asking. How was she dressed? For instance The colour of her dress. Red. Wait, let me think. Actually rather green. Cannot remember. But she was wearing a very pretty dress. She was with a soldier. A soldier. Actually. I'm no sure. I don't think so. He was walking slightly in front of her, so. - Hello, friends! - Hello, friends! I may have some work for you. You know, Garris? The old lady and her rose bushes. The soil in her garden needs digging. Why don't you do it? I don't know how. I've never been good with my hands. I've never worked; I'm not gonna start now! Alright, we'll go. Yes, we'll go. Will you join us for lunch? With great pleasure - What is that? - A Tench. The pond is full of them. This swamp is really a beautiful place. I understand why you stay here. You'll have to explain, cos I don't understand. Freedom. Freedom. Come. Let's eat. Sit down. Don't we wait for Riton? Riton. He must be asleep. He celebrated May 1st a bit too much today, Sr. Riton. Help yourself. I'm glad to have lunch with you. At my place for a long time, we've been eating separately. We eat alone in the kitchen, at half hour intervals. Your stories are not very cheerful. Did you hear? What is that? A jumping carp. Riton asked me a question last night. My father will not speak to me because. I refuse to marry the daughter of a hardware store owner, Hortense. She had a 300.000 francs dowry. And a face you did not like? No. That's not it. There are some not so pretty girls who have a heart of gold. I just didn't want. What I enjoy is my freedom, my books, my music. Have you ever listened to jazz? A bit. I'll bring my gramophone one day, and play for you. the most beautiful jazz record I've ever listened to. An American I tended to at the Marne in 1918 sends them to me from Chicago. You were a male nurse? Only thing I could do. We needed them. Let me out! I have a fight at 8pm! Get me out! I want a talker to get me out! It's my right! Get me a talker! What is that? An attorney! If you don't know, learn to read. I must get out! I must be in the ring tonight. Calm down, Sordi. Tomorrow you'll get an attorney. - Tonight you stay here. - I do not want to stay here! Get me out of here right away! I'll get him. I'll get that bastard. He will pay for this! Very dearly! A car tyre. Nonsense. Journalists always exaggerate. That's too much, dad. That's the third one. The doctor said you must be careful. What the doctor says is as important to me as the first frog I ever ate raw. Did you really eat a frog raw? Yes, like that. - It was on a dare - It that why you are called p?p? the frog? Pierrot, would you like a slap? As long as I'm alive, you can keep your slaps to yourself. Such arrogance! Marthe, we must fire the fritz. As long as I'm alive, forget about it. Firsly, Berthe is not a fritz, she's from Alsace. When your poor mother passed away, when you were 5, Marthe, Berthe raised you. She's part of the family. What is this tyre story? Front page. Read for yourself. Laurent! How dare you? One day I'll read well and I'll teach you. So, this tyre? There was a boxing match last night at the gymnasium. the champion did not turn up and the crowd ransacked the place. they would even have thrown an old car tyre on the ring. According to the journalists, that is. Boxing does not interest me since the 12 July 1921 to be exact. The day of the fight between Georges Carpentier and Jack Dempsey, at Jersey City. Dad, you're repeating yourself. Carpentier lost, you told us a 100 times, It was a national tragedy. I'm not the one who said, it was a journalist. Which goes to show they don't always print nonsense. Won't you attend the directors' meeting? It's in half an hour. Whatever for? You do very well wothout me. Pierrot, get ready for school, the driver will be here in 5 minutes. Catherine, you did not touch your plate. I'm not hungry. Laurent. I will not change my decision. I am very fond of Lucien, but we cannot announce our daughter's engagement. to a mere employee. In the fall, when Bouthillier retires, I will make him head of Human Resources. Things will be different then. Sack Bouthillier now, then. And your senile father will let me do this without protesting? He would rather fire me instead. Good Morning, Sr. Richard. Good morning, Jules. How is your wife? Slowly getting better. Thank you, Sr. Richard. - Soon finished? - By next thursday, we can sail away. In the park pond? It's forbidden. I know a place where nothing is forbidden. Pierrot, let's go. You're coming to fetch me, right? You bet! Move over, Riton. Work faster. We're not cattle. Otherwise we'd chase flies away with our tails Watch your mouth please. I'm real glad that your friends are here. What is your first name again? Am?d?e. I have a big stock of wool, I'll make you a monogrammed cardigan My little vice. oh sorry, maybe you like to sniff tobacco too, Sr. Am?d?e. The coalman! Great luck, right at my doorstep. Perfect for my roses. Leave it, I'll do it. Do not dirty yourself. - Slowing down? - You have your hat. Without my cap I'm worth nothing. Put it here. And we're thirsty! Good God, silly me. Did not think of that. You must always get noticed. A man needs his wine. Not nice to ask for it, though. Not nice! Of course, while you chit-chat on a bench, you don't work up much of a sweat! Anyway, I'm going back to the bar to look for my cap. You set one foot inside that bar and we're through. Don't you think you've been plenty stupid? Still, I don't have my cap. Thank you. Any problem? It's nothing. Riton is lost his cap. yesterday morning, he's quite upset about it. A cap? I have plenty of caps! Aren't you thirsty? There's a tab at the corner of the house. Sometimes you're really nasty towards me. Real nasty. Sr. Riton! Yes, here I am! Here, pick one They were my husband's Looks lovely on you. You look like an englishman. Yeah, and I look like a pink flamingo. But you do look like a flamingo. Hello Sr. Richard. Good morning, madam. My neighbour. A very rich man. Normal, his name is Rich-ard. He must be surprised to see visitors here. Apart from the postman who brings my pension, no one ever comes. Pour away, Sr. Riton. What about courtesy? Pour for other people first. Sorry, Madam Mercier. No need to shame me in front of everybody. Not for me, no. Just a drop for me. To drink along. Sorry, Riton, Did not mean to offend. Goodness me! Pomerol? - It's too much, Madam Mercier. - It's ok. Imagine. Just before his death, my husband just ordered 120 bottles. 120 bottles! And since I don't drink. Drink slowly, Riton. A good wine must be savoured. If it was not that good, I would not drink it so fast. To your husband, who was a good man and makes us all happy. It's really good. That's not frog juice, that's for sure. Frog juice? What does that mean? A popular expression to talk about table wine. Nice metaphor Let me get you another bottle to bring back. Riton! What did I do this time? Nothing yet, you were about to. Leave this bottle, she did not give it to you. There, take this one back. And take the rest of the other one too. See? - We'll have to come back to finish - Tomorrow? No - tomorrow we clean the mess from the boxing arena. I read about that in the newspaper. They even said. someone threw a tyre onto the ring! -Yes A tyre. Imagine that. - Let me pay you for your afternoon. - No, no. You'll pay us when we're finished. It's our rule, Riton and I. Our rule? Are we eating tyres tonight? No. We cleaned up the gymnasium. We made 20 francs each. Tonight we're having ham, pasta, camembert and cherries. - What's the tyre for? - For the kids. It was in the rubbish we cleaned out earlier, and Garris wanted to bring it back. Place it one meter high. No higher or Cri-Cri could injure herself. Go, Cri-Cri. There, now we turn. There's your new home, Champ. If you keep out of trouble nobody will bother you. Your friend's name is Castor. - A regular. - Hello. Alright, have a nice stay. If you prefer the top bunk, I don't mind. As long as you don't wet your bed, it'll be fine. I've never seen you box, but I know about you, champ. I'm no more champion, My title was stolen. I'm no more a boxer, they've taken away my license. So shut up. Is this where you used to live, grandfather? Right here. I was born here, lived here almost 40 years. Your mother too was born here. And your granny, that you never knew, liked it here just fine. Was my granny nice to you? Yes. Come on. Let's try out our boat. - They still live here? - I think so. Hello little girl. I'm not 'little girl', my name is Cri-Cri You're very handsome. Are you from the city? Yes, with my grandfather. Your boat is very pretty. My grandfather made it. Want to play with my brothers? Go but don't get too dirty. Your mother would kill me. What's your name? Pierrot. - Like me! - I'm Jojo. Shall we play with your boat? Keep quiet! Shall we play with your boat? - I'd like to. - Come. Good day. Good day. Please have a seat. An old man used to live here. He's dead. I'm living here now. I used to live here too, with my wife and daughter. A bit further up. Collecting scrap iron. I had a donkey to pull my cart: Bourricot. He was more intelligent than many people I've known. We did quite some traveling together. I still have his blanket with smell of my good companion on it. All these potatoes for you alone? That's a lot. The kids next door love saut?ed potatoes. There's never enough. Would you like a glass of wine? I did not dare ask, but I won't say no. Your boat goes well. And after that? After that? After that. After that, I started scrapping iron for myself instead of others. My warehouse became a factory, I had electricity installed, the works. To tell you how it happened is not interesting. All I know is that I became an imbecile. From the swamp to owner of the Richard foundries, I don't think you're an imbecile. The old man told me. When I moved to town with my family. You're not happy here? You think the swamp cannot make you a living, you and your family? You will live to regret it. Even if you make millions, you will regret it. You know what you are, p?p? the frog? An imbecile. Would you like one? I don't mind if I do. These days I have to hide to smoke Why did they call you p?p? the frog? I'm called that way because I'm supposed to have eaten a live frog, on a dare. But it's not true. The old man called me p?p? the frog Cos I was good at catching frogs. The old man was right. I should never have left the swamp. I feel good here. Could I come back visit you? Whenever you want. Pierrot! My boy, I told you not to dirty yourself! My daughter Marthe must not know that we came here. We were supposed to be in the park! In the park. I swear. Me too. I swear. Don't worry, we'll clean him up in the basin. Come Thank you, sir. Go. Take off your clothes and get in here. Please, it disturbs me if you look. I know. Few people these days believe in love at first sight. But this was the day I got struck. Look at you! I ask you for the last time Were did you go? - In the park. - Do you want a slap? This is becoming a habit! I brought him to the swamp. What? In that place? Yes, where you were born, Marthe. I don't want to hear about it. Laurent does not want people to know about it. Go and change into your pajamas. Everything you're wearing goes to the wash. No lice in this house! You never had any lice when you lived there, Marthe. Grandfather, I did not betray you. No. - Good evening, Berthe. - Good evening. Dad, you can go to your swamp whenever you want, but not with my son. What would you like to eat this evening? - Saut?ed potatoes. - Consider it done. Have you heard, Champ? The president got shot. Why do I care? They also mention you in the newspaper. Never killed anyone myself. You're gonna get clobbered in civil court About 10 of them filing against you, asking for damages. The bar owner, 2 clients, 3 police officers. The fight promoter, your manager and the owner of the arena that was ransacked. It's all in the newspaper? Word for word. Eh, Jo. Want to read it? I have a talker who takes care of all this nonsense. 118 bottles! Please, Marie mother of God, let me drink just one bottle before being hit by lightning. Come, gentlemen. Come inside for shelter. Why didn't you come and play with me? Mister guard did not let me in. Will you come next thursday? - You want my ball? - I'd like to, but what if you get scolded? I'll say I lost it. Pierrot! Where are you? Come over here right this minute. You're gonna catch a deadly cold! See you thursday? See you thursday. If you have followed my story, one thing is sure: the stupidity of adults meant that Pierrot and I could not see each other any more. No frog juice, eh, Sr. Riton? You said it! You know what, Madam Mercier? Something good about such heavy rain If the sun comes out straight afterwards it's a good time for snails. It's exactly what I was thinking about. We could take the Tane train and go towards the black forest. Great minds think alike. I am not expecting anyone! Here comes the other great spirit. Sr. Am?d?e, you are soaking wet. Sorry for barging in unannounced. I'll take off my shoes to avoid dirtying your floors. Did you notice? What? The portrait looks like your Marie. My Marie? I only saw her once. Come in, Sr. Am?d?e. Your friends are here. Give me your jacquet. I'll hang it in the kitchen to dry. I went to see my notary public Got caught in the rain on the way back. Almost fell off my bike. Yo usee your notary often these days, no? It's for a plot of land I wish to sell on the Graves road. He may have found me a buyer. - Congrats, you're gonna be rich. - Rich, no. But I may be able to redecorate my room or buy some books. I made you some coffee. Do you like this protrait, Sr. Garris? Reminds him of someone. Reason enough to take it. I've gathered too many things I'm glad to get rid of some. - Listen, Madam Mercier. - Do take it It has no value anyway. I got it from the provision shop, in exchange of some coupons. Take it. I can't tell you how happy I am to have some company. Without you, in such bad weather, I would be sad the entire afternoon. Sr. Pignole! No smoking in front of a lady. At least ask for permission. You don't mind if I smoke, Madam Mercier? Of course not, Sr. Riton. Actually, I'll have a quick sniff myself. Sr. Am?d?e? Not keen. See Garris, you can smoke too. You just have to ask for permission. This is good weather. It's written in my book: "water in the gutters, time for snails" Don't you invent some of your sayings? My book also says: "strangers irritate you, friends break your heart." You're right for once. Tomorrow we pick snails. Money to be made. We leave very early. So tonight, you don't drink, you sleep. Are you coming along, Am?d?e? A nice walk, you'll get a tan. I'd love to. I've never been to pick snails. We meet at 6?m, the train station near the market. Agreed? Agreed Don't go so fast. The Tane train won't leave without us. - I have delicate feet! - Come on! Hi guys, how are you? After the Vacherie stop, you jump off halfway up the slope, ok? You'll see, there's a congress of big Bourgogne snails. - You're the best, Tane. - Only a train driver. Let's go. My feet! Come on, sit down. Where's Am?d?e? Wait for me! Come on Am?d?e! Quick! Use the steps, here. Sorry. I took too long to bathe this morning. No here. It's fragile. Sit down. The way you're dressed, the snails will hide in their shells. It's my first time, I did not know what to wear. I spent part of the night reading about snails in our region. Would you like some good advice? Always useful. We must stop halfway up the slope, after the place called 'La Vacherie'. In May-June, after strong rains, big Bourgognes are everywhere, falling over each other. You're the best, Am?d?e. I'm happy I came along. Get ready, it's about time. Come on, Am?d?e! I'm really happy I came along. What an adventure! I'm going back to my slippers. Can someone help? My two hands are full. Leave them here. You'll pick them up on your way back. Ok. Let's go. Garris! Lots of small grey ones over here. No, don't take the grey ones. Only bourgognes. They sell better. Ok - I let you go. You're lucky. No small grey ones, he said. Good hunt? Forgive me for not helping, I hate slugs. They are not slugs. Garris! Time for lunch. An onion Leave me something to drink this time. You see how he treats me? He likes you very much. He teases you because he's shy. I know, I'm not that dumb. But sometimes, I fear he'll do what he's been meaning to do for quite sometime. Which is? Going back on the road. Leave. Because he can make do on his own, anywhere. I know that he stayed because of me and the children. Us, without him. Is this a funeral? What's the matter? - Noting. I was talking about Pam?la. - Ah, ok. May I read you a few lines? I think they were written for us. - Certainly. - If it's not too long. Of course not! Listen. "Liberty is not lazyness, it's free use of one's time, it's the choice of the work and the exercise. Being free, in short, is not doing nothing, but being the sole decider of what to do or what not to do. You understand? I understand that being free, it's like the way we live. Precisely! We are the last free men! I'm really glad I came along. What an adventure! Come on, hurry up. Riton really has no luck. There's only one idiot in the whole world capable of leaving his shoes on the train rails. I don't care about the shoes. This way they won't hurt my feet anymore. Are you happy now? Hop on board. This poor bird threw itself at the train right at the entrance of the village of Voux. Here, for your kids, Riton. You're not dropping off for a drink? I'm not allowed to. He can't go to the bar bare feet. He'd look like a vagrant. He would shame us. You're right. And his feet are not very clean. And your face, fatso, you think it's clean? Come along, Am?d?e. You didn't think I'd forget about you? Smile first. I need a lot of patience with you. 'Patience and white wine win over strength or rage". I never got to taste Tane's turkey. It was early June, I think. I mostly remember the smell of compresses. Painful? That's what you get for playing in the rain. Her dress is ruined. I'll buy her a nice new one with the money from the snails. My hat first. I've been asking you for months. What do I look like, going to town without a hat. I'll buy you the dress. You sick my daughter is real sick? She caught a cold, she's not very strong. Luckily it's the warm season. The sun makes everything better. - Snails, ladies and gentlemen? - Your bourgognes are big. Picked yesterday, soaked last night and cleaned this morning. -1 Franc per dozen. - Go ahead, we don't do this every day. -4 Dozens please. - Off we go. 4 Dozens for me too. Straight away madam. There's enough to go around. Hello, Mister accordeon player. Hello, Marie. You sell snails these days? I sell a bit of everything, depends on the weather. You want some? They're not on my mistress's shopping list. And my 4 dozens? Certainly madam. They're not gonna fly off. I waited for you, you know. Is that so? Why? You were supposed to come and visit. I don't have much free time. But I'll come, you can count on it. Do you like earrings? Yes. Riton! Yes! Good day. There you go, madam. Thank you very much. Take my place. 1 franc 50 per dozen. Hello, Marie. Hello How much for a dozen? 2 Francs. It's cheap if you consider the trouble I went through. One dozen then. - I think the blue ones suit you best. - You think so? The gentleman is right. they are the ones, no hesitation. Ok, the blue ones, then. Good Bye, lovers. Why did you buy me a gift? Because it makes me happy. 11?m! I must be going. - I'll come visit. I promise. - Soon? As soon as I have enough free time. - Good Bye - Thank you How are you, Don Juan? I'll get back to my station. To do what? No more snails. Even at 2.50. Doesn't mean much, you know. No. It means absolutely nothing. I bought it for you at the market. You like it? It's beautiful. Good quality. He keeps his word. Not like you with my hat. You'll have your hat. You'll sleep with it. You'll be buried with it. I'll make you another poultice. I want my football. Pierrot! Jojo! The football, over here, straight away! And hurry up! Living proof that bad temper means good heart. There, little Cri-Cri. Sorry, am I intruding? Not at all. Come on in, Sr. Richard. No Mister between us. P?p?, like everyone calls me. Or buddy, like you say around here. A gift from my personal stash. I know someone who's gonna be happy. Did you paint this? No. I just wanted to touch it up. Why? So that it looks more like someone I know. This young lady is lovely. Sit down. Your friend Riton is not here? No. He's catching frogs. Frogs? at the pond of the 3 priests? I'm going. Give me a fishing rod and some line. Take the rod outside, it's ready. I'll give you a hook. No need. Really? P?p?. This is not for fun. We have an order from the Grand Hotel for 20 dozens for tomorrow night. You don't know me, son! You don't know p?p? the frog. Here come the reinforcements. I did not hear you arrive. - Can I take one of your frogs? - Help yourself. You don't use a hook? No need. It damages them. How do you do it? Not difficult, I'll teach you. Garris must see this, Otherwise he won't believe me, as usual. - Are you sick? - No. How come you're lying in bed when it's sunny outside? - That's not like you. - Sometimes, you need to think. True. People are not used to thinking anymore. But don't do too much of it. Just like for wine. You can meditate without help from the bottle. Are you gonna keep lecturing me much longer? Get up, I need an opinion. What's that huge book, the history of the world? I wanted your input for the new wallpaper in my bedroom. You understand? I'd like flowers in my room, but not too big, not too garish. Flowers that let me listen to music. That's not the way to choose. Look. Long live anarchy! That's what you need. Forget me nots? Forget me nots! - You think so? - Sure. Forget me nots! You're right! Everything goes well with forget me nots. Mozart, Bizet, Haendel, Louis Armstrong. Thanks. You have solved a great dilemma. Let's not exxagerate. I just have the knack for these things. Come and look! He took 120. 120! And without a hook. Come, quickly! Come Am?d?e. We must see that. I told you. 10 years ago, I would have done your 20 dozens. But I'm a bit tired now. - How many did you catch in the end? - I don't know. I didn't count. I don't know how to count. For money, my wife used to handle all this. At least, I have not lost the knack for frog fishing. Indeed! Will you cut it out with your negro music! Gives me headaches! Isn't it sublime? - Once again? - No, Otherwise Emilie will come with her carpet beater, and your gramophone Boom! Ayway I must replace the diamond and I didn't bring a spare. I would not want to damage this disk. What did you say it was? 'West End Blues". The trumpet player is Louis Armstrong, the best. To p?p? the frog, the ace of frog fishing. To friendship. To friendship, ?Eh, I got an ideia! I don't believe you. The hook damaged my frogs. They won't be good for the Grand H?tel. Shall we eat them tonight? My apologies. This is a great ideia. What do you say, p?p?? Well, yes. Maybe you're expected back at home. I don't care if I'm expected. My son-in-law wil make noise - great. My daughter will not talk to me for 3 days. At least I won't hear her voice. You, Am?d?e? Nobody ever expects me. And I've never eaten frog legs. I'd like to try. I'll do the cooking. Ok. Riton skins the frog, I take care of the fire, - and Am?d?e sets the table. - Alright. It's Cri-Cri. - She'd like to meet the rich mister. - Keep quiet. She'd like to see the rich mister. The rich mister's name is p?p?. Tell Cri-Cri I finish my glass and will be right over. Let's go. What's your first name? I would not like to spoil the evening. Hyacinth. Calling me that is forbidden! And you, son, if you want to make me happy, Stop being so respectful. As if I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth! I've lived in this swamp much longer than you have. Sorry p?p?, but there's no shame in being rich. Especially when you earned it with your own hands. I'd like to be rich. I was never richer than when I lived here. You wanted to talk to me, darling? I could not go and join Pierrot from town in the park. I had promised. I will explain to him that you were sick. Is that what you want? Yes. No wonder I found him a bit sad. He was a bit sad? But not too much? No. But I will tell him that you are resting well. And if you rest well, next week you can come and play with him. But what if the guard won't let me in? Don't worry, I'll be there. Nobody will prevent you from getting in. See you on thursday, my darling. Good night Madam. Tell Riton that if he comes back after the kids are asleep, he can go sleep outside. I will tell him, Madam. Why are you always nasty, mommy? I don't know. I don't know. Do you know what time it is? I don't care. Let me see. You've been drinking! Pommerol. Excellent. And where were you? Tell me. With some friends of mine. - You don't have any friends - On the contrary. I have friends. And who are these friends? People from "there", I suppose. Yes. And please don't talk so loud. You'll wake up everyone. It's strange, this habit you have of talking that way. - No, not this horrible thing. - There, smell it, memories! Do you know what I had for dinner this evening? No. Frogs! Alive? Alive! Ah, Bourricot. It's difficult to have some peace and quiet. Hello, Joseph. You look like you're in very good health. I don't look like anything. What do you want to tell me, talker? Good. Listen. I have rather bad news I'm afraid. But I may have some good news. I'm not saying that. - it's sure. - Out with it. I pleaded as best I could in front of the tribunal. I even thought. I just want to know the results. Well, To pay the damages to all claimants, Your bank account was not enough. We had to confiscate, and auction off. Not my mother's house...? My mother's house? Joseph, your mother has been dead for years. So what? I bought it for her! We only have one mother! Please, Jo. Behave. I got nothing left? Joseph! Don't you want to hear the good news? That if I'm a good boy, I'll see my sentence reduced? Since I'm polite, I won't tell you where you can put your reduction I wish you good day. Is that you, Marie? How did you guess? I'm glad you're here. It could only be you. I like your smile. How do you find me, better or worse? I prefer your real hair colour. But this is nice too. I love them; I wear them all the time. Have you been living here for long? It'll soon be 12 years. - And you never felt like leaving? - Yes, often. It's beautiful here. But why did you not leave? Show me your house. Is it a portrait of your girlfriend? I don't have a girlfriend. But you must have known many women during your life. A few, but they did not matter. Why do you live alone? Why are you not married? Probably because I did not find the right woman. You ask many questions! My turn to ask you a question. Who was that soldat with you the other day? B?bert? A friend, nothing more. There you go, no need to get excited. That's exactly what I thought. I slept late last night. My bosses were having a party. And alcohol makes me sleepy. Just a drop. To make peace. I'm not angry with you, you know. I just don't want you to imagine things. I would never go with a man before marriage. Never. You believe me? Of course I do. Well Cheers May I smoke? As much as you want. Garris, Garris! Come! Forgive me. My neighbours went to the village, I must watch over their kids. - What's the matter? - Cri-Cri is gone. - Which way? - This way. Come here darling. It's over Run and get Dr. Legars. His house is at the bottom of the hill before town. Cough. Again. Is it serious? If it turns into a pneumonia, it can be. She needs medication immediately. - What has she done this time? - Nothing. Can't you see she's sick? My little Cri-Cri. Not too much medication, Doctor, we don't have much. Enough to buy a ridiculous hat! Give Cri-Cri whatever she needs, I will pay. All this is this bloody Riton's fault. Riton, always Riton! That one, he has ruined my life proper! A chicken. That's what he is. A Chicken. On top of which he is stupid. Really stupid. Couldn't he watch his kids himself? And of all days he had to go to town today. As soon as the girl is feeling better, I take my things and leave. Anywhere. Far from here, far from Sr. Pignole and his family. And Marie. She did not even recognise herself on the portrait. She must have left unhappy. For once she comes to visit, and I leave her alone and don't come back. - Shit! Shit! - Garris, You must come. - Beat it. Leave me be. - No It's for Cri-Cri. I gave her the syrup but I cannot manage with the pills. Manage on your own. I want peace. Let's go, you irritant. Higher! Higher! Pass it to me! No! Higher, higher! You made this kite, p?p?? Gives me something to do. Since Pierrot left for holidays, I'm bored. I know someone else who misses him too. - P?p?, thanks for all the. - It's my pleasure. It will be a welcome change from the usual beans. How is Garris? Not good these days. Why is that? Garris sometimes needs to be alone, and it's best to leave him be. I'll tell you what's wrong. Your Garris is in love. That's all. Maybe, but that's none of your business. You're looking for the Loiseau? They left to spend the summer in Nice. ACtually I was looking for their maid. Marie? They took her with them. Did they tell you when they're coming back? Previous years September, Sometimes October. - Thank you, Madam. - You're welcome. Crir-cri. So nice to see you back to normal. - Can I tell you something? - Of course. It's regarding Pierrot. Your brother? No, the one from the city. I think I'm in love with him. Really? Are you sure? Well, no. What does it feel like to be in love? Why do you ask me? Because you're in love too. Who told you that? Mommy. She said we don't see you anymore because you're in love. What's it like? We're happy and sad? Is that it? Yes, it's more or less like that. You're a very clever girl. Hello, Raymond. Hello. Hola, Hyacinth. You're very handsome today. - My daughter forces me, as you know. - Yes, Yes. What do you bet I still know how to do this? Go ahead. You are still pretty good at it. Remember when we used to do this together? Feels like yesterday. What can I do for you...? - I need a favour. - Yes. I need you to write a bearer's cheque for me. That's easy! There. Good. - How much? -1,000 francs - Where are you going? - What do you think? Going to work. They need men at Testud's place, to work with the harvesting machine. No need to do any more work for me, P?p? gave me a cheque. Show me? 1,000 francs! That's too much. We'll never be able to pay him back. That's not my style. He does not want us to pay him back. We swamp people, we live off nothing. the bourgeois will not like that. they will think it's irregular. It will appear improper, and P?p? will have problems with his family. We'll return him his cheque tonight. I could have put these 1,000 Francs to good use. You won't be short of anything. I'll work. I will deliver coal. Coal? that's too tough for me. I said 'I' would deliver coal. You will go fishing. Not his style, not his style. My style is to be human. Ready! Do you have some shoe polish? We don't have enough to eat and you want some shoe polish? You really have a nasty disposition. Riton is dressed like a gentleman! Oh the sneaky one! Testud, can I take one hour off? I'll work later tonight. Go ahead. No, not him! Where are you going? Taking a walk. I was just passing through. Of course. That's why you're wearing a tie. Hand over the cheque. We can't cash it. The negro is there. Banania! You're afraid of him? Come with me. - Hello, buddy. - Hello, buddy. Happy to see you. Are you nuts! Sir. 1,000 Francs to the bearer. Is that it? My goodness! Say thank you. Thank you very much, sir. And now? We cashed in the cheque. Isn't that what you wanted? Now we return P?p? his money. What? Hello. Your cap. We are friends of P?p?. Is he in? We'd like to talk to him. He's not in. He went to run an errand but he should be back shortly. We'll wait for him outside. Ok. Oh, what a surprise, these are friends of mine. Put them in the living room. Come on. Come in, put yourselves at ease. Sit down. Berthe, aperitifs! - We did not want to disturb you. - You are not disturbing at all. What brings you here? This. What is this? Your money. Why are you returning it? It's my money. I do what I please with it. Berthe, set this down here and leave us, please. You must understand, We may be poor, but we're proud. If someone does something for us, we must pay back. Otherwise, we're not even poor, we're miserable. No. I don't understand. Then you must have forgotten. Hello, father, am I intruding? Of course not, son in law. Let me introduce two of my friends, Messrs Garris and Riton. People of the swamp, like me. They came here tonight to return money that I lent them. You see, Laurent, people of the swamp are honest. Unlike all those clients whose ass you kiss constantly. Isn't that true, Laurent? My friends, let me show you out. It's not true, you are not my friends. I have no more friends. Come on, tell me. Tell me what you think. What I think is that you are right. We may be poor, but we're not miserable. There are days when I am real happy to know you, Sr. Riton. The rest of the year, how is it? I'm still happy. With all this we missed our aperitif. I'm gonna buy you an aperitif you won't soon forget. Aperitif, here we come! Jo, I came to tell you... 6 months it's a long time. - Long for whom? - For you, For you, Jo. And for me. Well, Jo, I met someone. What do you want me to do? Cry? What do I care Go with whom you please. I left some cigarettes. Thank you. You will have been kind until the end. September came and went, like every September month does. Garris brought me to town one afternoon, a beautiful afternoon I would never forget. Pierrot! You're back! Yes, school has started. Don't you want to come in, my dear boy? If my grandfather is ok with it. Sr. Richard, Come in with him. It would make me so happy. Sr. Richard, May I introduce, senhor. Am?d?e and Sr. Garris. We know each other. We are good friends. And great frog lovers. I'll fetch some wine, and some snacks for the kids. I'll go with you. We've missed you, you know. I was the one who was punished the most. By the way, 15 December is Tane's birthday. We do a big dinner at my place. Will you come? Of course I will. - Who is Tane? - The driver of the black forest train. A nice guy. You will like him. My husband must have known him. He knew everyone. These two are cute. They are happy to see each other again. You brought her along on purpose? "...and the green paradise of children's love, the innocent eden, filled with furtive pleasures..." "Is it now further than India and China? Can we recall it with plaintive cries? and animate it with a silvery voice, the innocent eden, filled with furtive pleasures." Bravo! It was beautiful. Yes? Can I help you? Sorry to intrude, I would like to talk to the maid. That's me. I meant Marie. She does not work here anymore. I'm replacing her. During the holidays, she met a pharmacist, in Nice. Not very young, but very rich. In no time it was done: the ring, the mayor, the priest. You mean she got married? Just like that. Can you believe her luck? Are you related, a friend maybe? A friend yes, kindof. See you, Jo. I like you, Jo. I don't want to say 'see you soon' Then don't say it. Hey, Jo. Nice to see you free. - Hug? - And what else! - Nippy - Wait, I got lots of clothes in the car. Everything I could salvage. What are you going to do now? I know perfectly well what I will do. Be reasonable. That rat-face was piss drunk. - I'm going to kill him. - Kill him? How so? - It's hunting season right? - Yes Hunting accident. It happens. If you get caught, you don't get 6 months; you lose your head. Let's go. P?p?! Garris! - I am doing a delivery in the high district. Shall I drop you off? - Ok. Sorry I'm not shaking your hand. Coal. Mind if I take the leash? Bourricot was not exactly like that. He had a temper. I wanted to tell you. I won't be able to make Tane's birthday dinner. It's the date the family has chosen for the engagement of Catherine, my grand-daughter. Engagement is during the day. You can come out at night. I will try, but this sort of dead boring celebrations can last until 2 am. Who is Catherine marrying? An awful man. Similar to my son-in-law. She won't have fun everyday. Fortunately, she's different. She'll understand pretty quickly. If you'd like to bet. This idiot Lucien, within a year he'll be wearing horns. Santa Claus! Your bear! Wait! Why do you run away like this? Do I scare you? You thought I was someone else? I mean you no harm. See? You lost a bear! There. Happy holidays. I too did some shit jobs when I was young, like 'sandwich-man'. 'sandwich-man'! The bastard! Wait, Santa Claus! Wait! His name is Henri Pignole. Unfortunately, I have no address for him. He was recommended by. a Sr. Richard. Where can I find this Sr. Richard? At his house, Marshall Fayolle Street. Daddy, please! Let me have my fianc?. Gentlemen, if you please. Sr. Mayor, what do you think of this Adolf Hitler? He's a strong man. He will be chancelor soon. And then. He will re-arm Germany, then war. A good little war is not bad for business, isn't it, Laurent? - Granny, you're ok? - Yes. Here comes the horned one - What? - Nothing. I told that man "If you really want to be my lover you will have to duel against my husband" - Do you know what he did? - I don't give a shit. - I beg yor pardon? - I don't give a shit. Did you stab in some garlic at least? Yes, Sr. Pignole. It smells real good. What's wrong, Riton? - The boxer is back. - So what? It worries me, that's all. Let him come, your boxer. This time, winter has really started! Sorry I would like to see Sr. Richard, please. I'm his son-in-law. As you can see, we are in the midst of a function. - May I know the reason for your visit? - Pignolle, Riton Pignolle. Does that ring a bell? Come, Sr. Richard. - What's the matter? -A tall, brown-hair man. Looks nasty. - I don't know him. - Please go and have a look. Don't let the other idiot speak for you. Please excuse me. Ah, sorry. - What did he want? - Nothing much. Just to know the address of one of your friends from 'over there'. A certain Riton, I believe. You told him? I have nothing to hide. Why not? Idiot! What's his business with Riton? Nothing good, I think. Nothing good. Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Come on, blow the years away. Well done! Cheers! Cheers! Thanks, guys. What a pity p?p? could not make it. - He can still make it. - At this hour? Don't think so. Let's drink to his health. To p?p?'s health! He won't come, at this hour. Close the door, we're freezing. - Good morning madam. - Good morning. Is Pierrot in? Please come in. Pierrot. Pierrot. Hello, Pierrot. Hello. It's a fake one. It's for you. Your grandfather was a champion frog fisherman. And he ate them alive. Be strong. Madam. Sir. - Do you live here, little one? - Yes. Do you know Riton Pignole? He's my father. Do you know where he is? Near the pond. He's fishing. You look nasty. Don't do that. You bet I will! I've been thinking about it for months! First I'll shoot off your balls, then I will watch you suffer for a while. Just for pleasure. And when I feel like it, I'll shoot your face off. I'm sinking! Shit, I'm thinking! Get me out?! Grab this! I don't want to die like this! Grab on! Pull! Pull! Pull harder. My leg! Cri-Cri, bring the gentleman to my place. My leg! My leg is broken! How is he? Like someone whose leg is broken. Is he in pain? You should have thought about the pain beforehand. I've never been so scared in my life. Never. I understand. A lost cow once fell in. We tried everything. the poor thing sunk in, sunk in Slowly suffocated to death. Horrible, no? My goodness! Alright, I need to get back to the hospital to look in on Riton. See you later. You can wear this. Tell him I'll visit him tomorrow. Tell him thank you. That I would do anything for him. Anything. I'll tell him, buddy. There you have it, the whole story. Time has since passed. Many things were told to me, I didn't witness them first hand. Maybe I distort a little bit. Most of those I met that year are gone, of course. Hey, friend! Others too. What does it matter. Our father and Jo Sordi, both equally stupid, could only get on well. They became inseparable. Jo became boxing manager, dad was corner man. They died together, in Lyons, under the bombs in May 44. 3 years later I married Pierrot. I was 20. He became a famous doctor, and thank God, he's still alive. The small frog Garris gave him never leaves his pocket. You will of course wonder what became of Garris. He left on a spring day. No one ever heard from him again. But I'm pretty sure that he walked towards the sun, went to Nice, and eloped with a pharmacist's wife. As for the swamp, It's been drained long ago to make space for a world of fools. There are times in life when you'd want everything to remain the same forever.
