Paris, Royal Academy of Medicine 181. There is nothing more famous in natural history than the "Hottentot apron." Yet nothing has been the object of such intense dispute. Some long denied it existed, while others claimed it was mere art or whimsy. And among those who saw it as a natural adjustment, each had his own opinion about which organ parts it developed. But these doubts must yield to positive fact. I have the honour of presenting to the Academy the genitals of this woman, prepared so as to leave no doubt about the apron. I pray you, pass it around. The outer lips intersect a four-inch-long oval from which extends a semi-cylindrical protuberance one and a half inches long and half an inch thick, the lower extremity of which widens, branches out, and opens to constitute two wrinkled fleshy petals about two and a half inches long and one inch wide. These two appendages form a heart shape with long and narrow lobes comprising, at the centre, the vulval opening. It is obvious to anyone comparing these genitals with those of European women, that the two fleshy lobes forming the apron consist at the top of the prepuce and labia minora, while for their remaining length are but an extension of the labia minora. The inner vulva and womb reveal nothing unusual. The "Bushman's veil" is not a particular trait establishing a correlation between women and apes. As the labia minora of the latter are in general inconspicuous. Yet one cannot say the same of the fatty tissue forming the female Bushman's huge buttocks which appear natural and common to the entire nation. They distinctly resemble those of female mandrills and baboons, which at a certain point in their life show considerable growth. Our closer study of the head offers greater scope for distinction. It's the yardstick for classifying nations. And in this respect, our female Bushman offers remarkable and unusual differences. Her bony head and facial structure show a striking combination of Negro and Kalmuk traits. As we know, the Negro has a prominent snout, with the face and skull compressed on the sides. The Kalmuk has a flat snout and broad face. Our Bushman has a more prominent snout than the Negro, a broader face than the Kalmuk, and the nasal bone smaller than both. And in this latter respect, I have never seen a head which more resembles the ape. What has been hereto noted and must be repeated, in view of the errors propagated by recent works, is that neither the Gallas, nor the Bushman, nor any Negro race gave birth to the people who gave rise to the civilization of ancient Egypt from whom it may be said that the whole world inherited the principles of law, science and even religion. I present this mummy head so the Academy may compare it to that of Europeans, Negroes and Hottentots. If you would. Today, as we distinguish race according to the skull and having in our possession so many Egyptian mummies it is easily proven that whatever their complexion they belonged to the same race of man as we. Their skull and brain were as voluminous. In a word, they were no exception to the cruel law that seems to impose eternal inferiority upon races with depressed and compressed skulls. London, June 1810. Saartjie, that was fantastic. Really excellent. You hear? Let's go, one more time. Soon all of London will want to see our Venus. Alexander, you should negotiate a bigger theatre. Quit bookkeeping, let's drink. Someone has to keep a level head. Stop playing with your food and eat. You're getting too thin. Goodnight. Goodnight. We should do likewise, if we want to keep up this pace. Perfect. - Goodnight. - Sleep well. I'm sleeping. I just want to talk. I'm tired. Open up, just to talk. Saartjie, come on, open. Saartjie! Where are you? Saartjie? You're drinking! We have to go to work, hurry. Go and get dressed. Well? What are you sulking about now? I'm tired. The show isn't easy. It isn't what you promised. I'm not a harlot. No one thinks that. Everyone knows you're not a harlot. How long have we been in this together? Don't you realize how close we are to our goal? Put that down. What'd you have done in Cape Town? What would you be now? You'd have been a servant all your life and you know it. How could you think I'd wish you harm? You were there when Anna gave birth to our children. You gave them your milk! You're part of the family. I'd never hurt you. Never! I'd never have attempted this if I didn't have total trust in you. Look. You're famous! London's raving about you. I went into debt to make this journey. I left my farm, my wife and children behind. All because I believe in you. They can look, but not touch. No, no. It doesn't work that way. They have to touch you. Feeling is believing. To make sure you're not just a stuffed cushion. You disappoint me. I thought you were more clever. I've never been clever. I'm an idiot. No, you're not. You're far from stupid. You're famous and soon you'll be free. You know what that means? We can return to Cape Town, with our heads high and pockets full. You'll do whatever you want. Free! Money is freedom. You'll buy your own little farm. "Saartjie's farm." You'll have your own cattle. And the men will be lining up to marry you. Come now. Let me tell you something. You'll be... a good wife, and most of all, a wonderful mother. You hear? We have to seize this opportunity with both hands. Grasp and profit by it. We have to go to work, so get dressed. One little arm... and the other. That's right. In a daze again! Put that down. Give me your hand. Come here. I have something to show you. Something nice. You've done a good job of late. It merits a little recompense. I've hired these boys for you, to serve you... These boys know the city. So if you want to do something, to go for a stroll, or a tea, to go sit in the park, or even to ride in a carriage, whatever you like! Tell the boys and they'll take care of it. We brought a few surprises. Like to see? What is this? Let's see... For you. You don't like it? Fine. Let's open the big box. Now what's inside? A hat! It's a hat, look. A real lady's hat. Saartjie, how pretty! Dimwits! Go on, open it. How soft... Put them on. You're the one showing that fat Negro girl? She's got talent too. So, you speak Afrikaans? Saartjie, he speaks Afrikaans. A little. I showed my bears over there. Folks were impressed. No bears in your country. No, no bears. I even stayed longer than planned. Made a lot of money. Nice country. Yes, nice country. To your health. Drink with me Saartjie. Cheers, Saartjie. Saartjie, this is R?aux. That was great. You hear? Keep it up, it was wonderful! And it's signed: "An Englishman." It's a disgrace! A tissue of lies. Nonsense! With a clear conscience, he'd have at least signed. "An Englishman?" What does that mean? That he's better than me? He can't spout such absurdities without consequence. What can you do? Don't forget, here, they have freedom of speech. You can't stem rumour. It's proof of our success. The nature of rumour is to spread, it's unstoppable. At least they're talking about us. But they're lying. About me, not you. Saartjie is not a slave! - Something wrong? - Nothing. Just show more enthusiasm! You hear? They hurt me. - Come now... - Don't let them. That's enough. Control yourself. They're here to have fun. This is a foreign land. We can't afford the slightest error. Success always attracts birds of ill omen. What are you doing? I've had enough of your whims. It's the last time, you hear? Attack them, attack. Grab them. Attack! What's got into you? What the hell are you playing at? Fend them off! What's got into you? What's your game? You've been drinking? I'll teach you. Dirty Negroes, in league against me! Go to hell! As for you, you fat Negress! Bloody hell! You stupid Negress! Are you mad? Are you out to shame me? Have you lost your mind? Shaming me before the whole of London! Never again! What's your game? Think you're clever? Want to ruin everything? Don't you see others resent our success? No, you have to show off. You said more heart... I didn't ask you to sing! They come to admire your backside. A fat healthy arse they can touch. You're human, like they are. Your body enthrals them, you should be proud. You said I could sing and dance, but instead I'm in a cage, grunting like an animal. They pinch me, it's always the same. - I don't want... - But it's only a game! You and I, we play like children. I want beauty! Beauty? Meaning? You want to play Ophelia too? Our show is beautiful. We give pleasure to those poor English folk who come to dream. Understand? We give them a taste of the wild. Isn't that beautiful? I no longer want the cage. What's wrong with it? Why don't you go in the cage? Why not! Great idea! Let's try it. You push me into the cage, I break free and punish you with the stick. I like this idea. Well I don't. That's enough. We came here to make money. And we're making lots. And we'll make more if you obey! What's wrong with you? Wake up! Is it money you want? Here's money, help yourself! Take all you want! I'm sick of your tantrums! Let me show you. Know what this is? A letter from the courts. The police, they want to put us in prison. And you too. Saartjie, it's times like these that reveal true friends. Come here, sit down. Can I count on you? The truth! The truth, Saartjie! Over here! To drink! It works well enough. But I don't trust her. - Why not? - She's a trollop. A trollop? - Trollop! - He says you're a trollop! She's already tattooed like a sailor. A sea monster! As long as Saartjie has her bottle, she's harmless. A bottle and she's happy. They're jealous of me. That an Afrikaner can make good in their country. Even my partner. They dragged my name in the mud. But I won in court! Yes, I won. Me... I'm not like that. If she really has what you say between her legs, that's worth thinking about. Patience. Everything is in order. And you will see all you want to see. All? All. I'll show you. They dragged my name in the mud. Saartjie... We'll continue our journey with my friend R?aux. He paid us well to see. So be a nice girl, if you would... Is she baptized? No. Paris, April 181 5. Have no fear, he's in control! It'll make you fertile! So come closer! It's not horse shit, it's for real! Thank you, ladies and gents! No. No... Don't be ashamed. It's you. It's your body. God must have made you that way to teach men something. You should be proud of it. You are of those to whom nudity has been granted like a gift. Naked, you are closest to your true self. You must accept that, Saartjie. You are so beautiful. Come, let me look at you. Let me look, Saartjie. Don't be ashamed. Let me look at you. I know exactly what to do, Saartjie. If you listen to me I will raise you to the highest spheres of society. Have no fear. Have no fear, Saartjie. You are so beautiful. Bravo, my dear G?raldine! Bravo for that hymn to Paris. What a voice, what grace and beauty! So, in your honour, and that of the whole troupe, I wished to celebrate, in my own way, the play's wonderful success. Dear friends, please join me tonight in warmly welcoming our guest, the Hottentot Venus! Ladies and gentlemen. May I present, Master R?aux, famed animal tamer, who defeated such wild beasts as bears, tigers and even lions! And who accomplished the extraordinary feat of making this wild Hottentot into an obedient young lady. I bring you the show-stopping. Hottentot Venus! Ladies and gents, please remain calm! Easy does it, easy. Easy... Stay still, head down... Easy does it... Ladies and gents, stay calm. Don't worry. Down! Down! Turn, so we can admire your pretty little rump. Come, show us! On the ground! On the ground! Ladies and gents, have you ever seen such grace, such beauty and voluptuousness, such sensuality? Turn, turn... Come on, turn! Easy does it. Miss, please be seated. Easy does it... Now, back... Back up! Easy does it. Back you go... Ladies and gentlemen, a volunteer, a daring man or woman! A brave man or woman! An adventurer, an adventuress! Come! Come, Captain! Your mount is waiting. Easy... Have no fear, Captain. Come closer, easy does it. In the saddle, have no fear. Now Captain, gallop! At a gallop, Captain! Gallop, gallop! Bravo, Captain! Thank you, Captain, bravo! Thank you. Now up... Up! Back... Up you go. Up you go, nice and slow... Easy does it! Ladies, please, stay calm. Now bow. Salute the ladies and gents, bow! Ladies and gentlemen, the Hottentot Venus! Easy... Easy does it. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to skilful taming, our young lady, our black Venus, has acquired a musical ear so fine that I defy anyone here present to equal it. Sir, she has what we call perfect pitch! Gentlemen, please. The young lady is sensitive. Don't laugh, it may hurt her. She has what's called perfect pitch. Ladies and gents, for this, I shall unchain her. No, she leaps all over! Easy, easy... That's it, nice and easy. Be wild, pretend. Easy... No, don't clap! Sir, if you please, a few notes of your own choosing. Please. Incredible! Absolutely incredible! Ladies and gentlemen... Perfect pitch! What a show! Bring this apple to the prettiest lady among us. What a strange tongue! Nice and easy... Please... Nice and gently. Have no fear. Remain still, don't be afraid. Remain calm, have no fear. Very good, that's right. Well done, Miss. Very good, thank you, Miss. It is she who is the prettiest! She is the prettiest! Is she not? Of course! Ladies and gentlemen, a fine musical ear but also grace and allure. A primitive tribal dance. Music! Impressive! Are you mad? Have you lost your mind? I told you about England. I was almost jailed for indecency and you're at it again? But this is France! Here, no one gives a damn. I'll take you to places you can't even imagine! I don't care if this is France. I even changed my name to shake off the scandal. Sure, but admit it, they liked it! Stop being such a killjoy. Pretty girls, pleasure. It's a huge success! You're playing with fire. Come, drink with me. We've earned good money... May I introduce myself. Jean-Charles Mercailler. I'd like to drive Miss Sarah home, with your permission. For private parties, there's a special rate. No, you misunderstand. You're playing with fire! Loads of money! Ladies and gentlemen, the Hottentot Venus! Thank the public, a bow! Champagne! Bravo once more for that wonderful dance! You must be thirsty. She has good taste. Sorry? - More. - She spoke! - She spoke? - Yes. More, Edouard! Have no fear. You were thirsty. You'll make her tipsy. Easy. Feel better now? Could you entertain my wedding this summer? The 23rd of August. At the church! Wonderful! Does she miss her country? Yes, she does. Do you have a family? Children, perhaps? - How old is she? - Does one ask a woman her age? Can she read? Does she like Paris? Excuse me, do you like Paris? Yes. She likes Paris! Do you prefer Paris or London? Paris. You believe in our Holy Saviour? She's baptized! - What is her baptismal name? - Sarah. - Sarah! - Delightful. Sarah... Can we touch her hair? Have no fear, go ahead. Well? It's strange! It defies definition. It's like moss. Why not teach her one of our dances? A dancer, please! Music! They say you're the daughter of a tribal chief, that your family was wiped out by the Whites? They say you're a princess. Is it true? It's not true? Then what did you do back there? You worked for the Caezar family? Doing what? You took care of animals, children, cooking? So you were a servant? Right... Well... That's not much good. That doesn't help. And do you have parents? What does your father do? Dead. Dead? And your mother? Dead. I see. And do you have children? Are you married? Dead. Your husband is dead? Child. Your children are dead? Massacred by the Whites? Is that it? How did they die? Dead... Dead. Of illness? Hunger? I'm sorry. Forgive me for reawakening such painful memories. Bad memories of home? You must feel very lonely. That's all very sad. Yes... Princess, that was nice. Can I write that you're a princess? Princess... Our lady readers would like that. Princess. Please, ladies and gentlemen! Kindly regain the exit! Ladies and gentlemen, if you please. Ladies and gents! The show is over, quickly now! - Hello. - Sir... Georges Cuvier. You had a letter from the Natural History Museum about my visit. Not that I know of. No matter. We wished to study this Bushman female more closely, if you see no inconvenience, above all to make sure she is a genuine Hottentot. Of course she's a genuine Hottentot. So you are sure she possesses all the distinctive traits of that species? Meaning, the famous "Hottentot apron". I say she does, and believe me, I should know. Right. I wish to have her examined by a committee of scientists. For how long? A few days. And in the meantime? We can't afford to stop, even for science. Don't worry, we obviously plan to compensate you. How much, Sir? - Well, off the cuff... - How much? We have a substantial budget for the acquisition of most rare species. If what you claim about her feminine traits prove true we will be most generous. Paris, Natural History Museum, 181 5. You must cooperate with these people. These French scientists will pay us a lot of money. You hear? So work with them. Good day. Jean-Baptiste Berr?, naturalist. - Madam... - Hello. Let me take you to the professors. Quite a load, let me help. Thank you. Our props, for the show. Come in. Good day. So, let's get to work. If it's alright with you, we'd prefer to make our own observations. - Does she understand French? - No, not much. I'm going to leave you here. Do exactly as they ask. Be nice to them. Goodbye, then. Show her to my office. To get ready. This way, please. Make yourself comfortable. I'll leave your bag here. See you later. Why is she wearing that loincloth? That wasn't in the deal. Where's her guardian? Don't worry, I'll see to it. These men must be allowed a detailed description of the procreative organs. See that she takes off that loincloth as agreed. Of course. Make sure you capture every detail. The light is better in the conservatory. Gentlemen... Excuse me, could you take off... your loincloth? Take it off. Leave her be, don't insist. The skull diameter is seven inches. Skull diameter, 7 inches. Don't forget to measure from base of nose to tip of chin. Two inches and four twelfths. Some water? Would you like? No, please... To there. The base of the nose. Like so. The Camper Angle is 71 degrees. The breasts fall to four inches above the navel. The areola seems unusually large. Could you measure it please? Areola of right breast, three inches. Two and nine twelfths for the left breast. It is perhaps the hugeness of the buttocks that gives this disproportionate impression. Most certainly, yes. Could you please check the height of the buttocks from the dorsal junction. There. Right there. Please, don't move. Three feet five inches and four twelfths. I seem to observe a kind of appendage, but it's hard to say. Maybe we should continue measuring to win her trust, then it should be no problem. Continue measuring. Go ahead... Eat. In any order you like. How lovely to see you. Thank you. Look. Me? Yes, you. Do you like it? Look at this one. It's you. And here... You, with a... young child. A baby. See? You're walking with a little baby. It's for you. A gift. Thank you. The teeth are close-set, healthy, very white and very large. Especially the upper incisors. Even larger than the Negro race. But clearly her head differs from that of the Negro. - May I? - Please... No, keep your mouth closed. There is indeed, in the shape and prominence of the jaw, a clear resemblance between this Hottentot and the orang-utan. An observation that did not escape Barrow. Moreover, judging from her protuberant buttocks... Did you have similar buttocks even as a young child? Have you had them since childhood? Are all the women of her tribe like her? After baby... It's characteristic of certain apes such as the female maimons in whom menstrual disorders cause similar buttock development. It apparently happens after pregnancy. Can we now finally remove that damned loincloth? Tell her it's purely for scientific observation. Such brutality! That's quite enough! You know why you're here. We have an agreement with your guardian. Take that off, right now! I want to see you. You! See you! Try the money. Let me be! Leave me alone! Not going to the hotel? I'm not sleepy. I was told you wouldn't show yourself. You were meant to show them. Why did you do that? Do you realize they refused to authenticate you? We have to return the advance. Do you know that? You know we were paid a tidy sum for you to spread your legs. Why is it a problem for you to spread them for such illustrious men? It's an honour! One word from them and all the courts of Europe would open for us. But no. I must return the money they advanced us. You'll return there nicely tomorrow, excuse yourself and obediently offer them what they want to see. No. Oh yes you will. No. Yes you will. No. You want to ruin us? To destroy everything? Do you realize all I've done to make someone of you? I left my wife and children. I left my wife. For you, for you! And all you can do is destroy! I joined up with that bear fucker and his whore to get you a theatre. And all you do is destroy! You mad bitch! All you do is complain! Bitch! Slut! Damn bitch! Damn you! I'll tear you limb from limb! Hush now. Saartjie... You have nothing more to fear. Saartjie... Look at me. Home... All will admire you, Saartjie. I want to go, I'm tired. We'll work together, I have a plan. I'll make you a great lady, Saartjie. A very great lady. I want to sleep. You'll be rich. Very, very rich. One day you'll return home, very rich. Salute the ladies and gents, bow. Down! Down! Down! Now, crawl! Move, crawl! Easy, now. Back up! Back up! Easy does it. Back up, nice and easy... Ladies and gents, a little hush! A volunteer! A daring man or woman! A brave horseman, or horsewoman! Step right up, have no fear. Madam, I see envy in your eye. Madam, step right up. Easy does it. Mount her, don't be afraid. Easy now... Straddle her. In the saddle, madam. Boldly! Go ahead, have no fear. May I? You may. Bravo, Marquise! Gently does it. Feel her out. Let her sway you to and fro. That's right... Very good. You ride her well! Easy! Easy, rebel. Win her trust. Feel her out. Thank you, madam! Bravo for your daring, your courage. For your sensuality, your beauty. Angelo, bring the fruit! Up! Up! Ladies and gentlemen, please. No sudden movements. I'm going to unchain her. The platter! What a prop! Blush not, madam. It is harmless. It's only for your pleasure. Ladies, have no fear. Easy! - Easy. - She's a real glutton. Earn it, earn it! Gently... Very gently. My arm is still trembling. What excitation. A little daring, this is all so coy. Don't tempt me! Saucy pig! What can one do? What's he up to? Squash it good! Off we go... Easy does it, easy... A drink for our Venus. She earned it! Ladies and gentlemen, please. Now, the crowning moment, of charm, grace and sensuality... Now, down. Down! Quiet, if you please. Now turn! Show us your pretty little rump! Turn! Turn! Ladies and gents, if you please... Now, up! Up! Up! Faster! Up! Up! Faster! Lie down! Lie down! Down! Ladies and gentlemen... The gift from God... Easy does it... Ladies and gents, come closer, nice and gently. Don't be afraid, nice and gently. It's totally diabolical! We all want to see. It's appalling! Ladies and gents, step right up! Come and look! Step right up and touch! Come and see! I wouldn't touch that. I told you it'd be fun. Incredible, I've never seen the likes. But what is it? Come, ladies and gents! Don't be shy! Come closer! Have no fear. Touch! Make room! Move aside! Give everyone a chance. Touch, sir, admire! A unique phenomenon from the depths of southern Africa. Don't be afraid, come and touch! Step right up. Take your pleasure. Use your imagination, your perversion. It's a gift from heaven. She's all yours. Taste the forbidden fruit. Come taste the forbidden fruit, have no fear. Give her pleasure, but gently. Please, sir, be gentle. No sudden movements. Come and touch, with delight, tenderness and pleasure. Be brave, come and taste! - She's crying. - No, she's not. Those are tears of joy, of pleasure. Give her pleasure. What's got into you? You're shaming me. It's no fun anymore. Not if she's crying. A little daring, a little courage! Ladies and gents, give her pleasure! Let those who haven't touched or seen! Who've not yet tasted this sensual moment. Leave her alone. Ladies and gents, a little hush! Spread! Show! Come and touch her! Step right up! Step right up! Don't look, madam. Let's make our own amusement. You're shaming me! Shaming me! - On your feet! - Can't you see she's crying? Mr. R?aux, what's going on? Ladies and gents, one moment please. Enough is enough, leave her alone. Go! Away with you! Away with you! Move it! Get up! On your feet! Now go! Go! He's such a brute! He's ruined it. You betrayed me! You shamed me in front of everyone! In front of everyone! You lied to me! Humiliated me! You betrayed me! You're nothing. You're not an artist. You're nothing! It's over! Finished! You're a nobody! Finished. It's almost all gone. Almost done. See? It sticks! First thing in the morning! Now spread your legs. Open wide... Let me work. Open up, relax. - You all went through this? - All of us! Leave your dress alone, it's in my way! Don't be such a chicken. You were moaning all morning. Help! Laughing opens her up. If you keeping pulling on it, it'll be useless. Madame, like to come and see? Someone important is coming. Well, it's sticky... He'll stick to you! He'll get stuck on me! Double the wages! It's torture. A'isha, you're too brutal. I do it myself. You'll feel better after. They'll arrive and I won't be ready. Yes, you will. Seen the state of me? Girls for the choosing! Already? Girls for the choosing! Ready, girls! Girls... Ladies... Welcome, sir. Come and look... Discover. This is Linda. Our little Asian wonder. Hello. Myriam. Hello. Our Flemish flame! Leila, stand up. Sir... All the beauty of the Orient. A red hot coal. Turn. Jeanne... Saartjie. Saartjie. Good day, sir. A'icha... I think the gentleman has made his choice. Jeanne, Saartjie, come. I'm happy to receive you. The big bedroom is free. No less. It's nice in here, girls. At least it's warm. Want company? Spend a bit, gents. That's a bit lean. Spread them! Hold that up. Spread the lips. Tell her to do it. Stop smoking. Stand up. Yeah! That's good. Yes, yes. Tell her to sit down. Spread. Was it good? It sure was. It's beautiful when you dance. Tell her, it's really beautiful. Honestly. - Thank you. - No, I mean it. And the show? Not doing it anymore? - Sorry? - When's your next show? I don't know. It's not too sure. Maybe when the weather gets a bit warmer. No sooner? A pity. It was extraordinary. - I really loved it. - It was a big success. Yes, it was the talk of the town. I loved it. She's really good. Seriously. When she dances and all that. And when she comes out of the cage... and charges the audience. They were scared to death. Really scared. Even I was afraid. It was fabulous. - We worked hard on it. - Bravo. Really great show. But it's true that... the world of show business... Personally, I couldn't do it. One day you're at the top. And overnight... you're forgotten. It can't always be easy... I wish you good luck. Thank you, sir. I thank you. Our pleasure, sir. Ladies... Until next time. On stage, I hope. Yes... See you soon. Here, that's for you. Do as I say and we can make money. I'm sick of hoping. If we're on the game, it may as well pay. Understand? We can make a lot of money with this. Alright. I arrived here. Started to work a lot. Sending money home, to my children and family. I know they're well. That's life. 20 Francs. 15 for me, 5 for her. And you? Got a husband? Children? Me... Live two years with white man in Papendorp, near Cape Town. He worked on boats. Many travel. Me... dream... travel. Him poor, me too. No money. After, he leave. It's why me leave. Girls for the choosing! Good evening, ladies. Penelope... who needs no introduction. Eloise... brand new. Charlotte, Myriam... Adela'ide, Leila... Sarah. Hello, sir. Sir, the choice is yours. Yes, harder, harder. - Harder. - Yes, sir. Whip me harder! Yes, sir. Harder, Jeanne, harder! That'll do. Yes, sir. Just relax. Excuse me. This way a little. Hold it. Hold it there. Fine. If she could raise her legs. Raise your legs, love. A bit more, that's right. - My God! - Yes, she's a bit special. So I see. Relax, madam. She's... very, very infected. It's beyond doubt. See the ulceration of her mucus membranes? She needs treatment fast, it's at an advanced stage. Go and rest. Join the others, we'll talk later. Who have we not seen? Leila, could you come please? And the name of the infected person? Sarah Baartman. Sarah... Baartman? Baartman. And I add... "Hospitalization." Look after yourself. It's cold outside. You should go to the hospital. When winter's over, we'll head out. We'll take our show on the road. Alright? Good day, sir. Good day, sir. Thank you, sir. Pincers. Scalpel. Width of the vulva... three inches and two twelfths. Weight of brain, 1 kilo 310 grams. Until 1974, Saartjie Baartman's remains were on display at the Paris Natural History Museum. In 1994, South Africa asked France to return them. She was buried on August 9, 2002 in her native land. Black Venus. Honourable chairwoman, honourable deputies... The private bill under consideration today was, as you know, unanimously adopted by the Senate on 29 January last. The government understands and shares its aims, to restore her dignity to Saartjie Baartman and ensure that her mortal remains rest in peace in her native land, South Africa.
