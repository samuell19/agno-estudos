CHA Tae-Hyun RIM Chai-Moo LEE So-Yeon Original Story, Saito Hiroshi Fuji Television Network, Inc. That damn NA Tae-Song!? Didn't you help him out? Back in the old days? But he hasn't called even once? Directed by KIM Sang-Chan, KIM Hyun-Soo That ungrateful bastard! See, that's the kind of singer we need. One big star! If we want to hold our heads up in front of the boss. Put a lid on it? That's why we're here, to find that big catch? Think of the mouths to feed! Finding another one isn't the answer. Mr. CHO. First, call the sales manager at Shangri-La Night Club. Mi-Ok, let's get pissed tonight, yeah? Where are all the pretty girls? You're so shallow, you know that? I wouldn't want you girls to drown, now. Hey! Did you practice the stuff I gave you? You suckers deaf or something? This is why you're just second-rate amateurs. I oughta just... Just listen to that. Now that's real music, ya hear? Yes, sir. Mr. NA, sir. Oh, of course. The music is ready, sir. Really, sir? Why, I'd be honored! I'll wait for you, sir! I'd die for you, sir. You better sound perfect out there. 'Cause I'll be singing on TV any day now, you suckers! Susie, Susie, I'm sorry! That lousy song! No-talent, Trot imposter! This way, sir. We came to see the sales manager. - Who should I say is here? - Tell him it's Mr. JANG from Seoul. Yes, sir. ...let Fate decide. I just love you, yeah! Only you! He can't sing like the real thing, but he sure dresses like him. The one, my one and only companion! Thanks, the next song is... the debut performance of my new single. Let's sing it together! One, Two, One, two, three, four! What the heck? Hey! Sing, you moron! Who planned to screw me over, huh? God, that piercing silence! I've been humiliated! Was it you? You? Who's the goddamn genius?! Just be honest with me. You're mixing medications, aren't you? You think you're big-shot rockers? Paris Hilton would do Rock better than you morons! Paris Hilton? What the hell are you looking at? As if your song is any better! What did you just say? You little shit! I'm gonna tear you to pieces! - Get off me! - Let go, you idiots! Sir, calm down! - Hey, hold on to him! - Somebody help me! 'Susie, Susie, I'm Sorry? ' What the heck did you do to Susie? BONG Dal-Ho! Open the door! Hey! You bastards! No! HIGHWAY STAR Jesus, those idiots are at it again! Stupid amateurs... You came in the night and gave me the best smile in the world then you left me to die! I walked as I stared up into the sky, the stars shining in the darkness. If you come back to me tonight, I will take you away forever. Don't you forget, forget about me! Don't ever forget! Even this starry, star-studded night. Even when the rain falls, I'll wait for you! That's him. That rich, yet delicate sound! Such a dynamic vibrato! It sends chills through my heart! I told him not to sing that crap! Mr. JANG, sir, one minute. I'm telling you, that asshole's gonna come after us. Yeah, I know. Where do we work now? There's plenty of clubs. Just drink up. Excuse me. Big Sound Entertainment. Marketing Director, CHO Seung-Ho? What the heck... It's a record label that trains musicians. Maybe not down here, but in Seoul, we're pretty well-known as the 'Midas' of pop entertainment. Nice to meet you, sir! Get up! I enjoyed your song. You have an outstanding voice. Oh, thank you. And you are... I... l'm BONG Dal-Ho, the lead vocalist. Will you come to Seoul and make some real music with me? - Just me, sir? - Just you. I don't really do bands. If you were solo, I could make you an album and really make you big star. - An album? - Look here, sir. Us four, we ride together and we'll die together. Dal-Ho, just tell him how it is. - Yeah, all for one, man. - Of course. I knew that I would... ...have to part with them some day. Yeah, it's good-bye forever, you rednecks. Like hell I'm gonna call you hillbillies. I'll be busy with the big city babes. BIG SOUND ENTERTAINMENT Thank you. Thank you very much. Your beloved Trot star, LEE Dae-Chil is here to grace this stage. Hey now, there's our star. Come in and have a seat! I hope I'm not intruding. MUSIC IS MY LIFE - JANG JUN - Make yourself at home. I know, it's a bit cozy, eh? True art always thrives in poverty. So... who are all those people? - Our star lineup, of course. - Huh? Well, isn't there anyone famous? Anyone I would have heard of? Nope, they're it. Don't worry, now that you're one of us, I'll take care of you! So sir, I guess you have Trot crooners too? Of course. Trot is the only thing we do. But, you're not... Am I doing Trot? Does genre really matter that much? Of course it matters! You heard me sing, sir and you want me to do Trot? What's wrong with Trot? Why on earth a rocker makes that tacky music?! God, I knew things were going too well. - Let's just call it off. - That's not right! Mr. CHO! - You know what this is? - What is it? - It's your contract. - Contract, my ass. You signed your name here. How much did we give Dal-Ho for the deal? The penalty fee is what, five or ten times more? You know, it's all in the contract. No, wait. Wait a minute. Please, just think it over. I mean, why me? Look, Seo-Yeon is here. Who is she? - One of our artists. Why? - Why didn't you say so? Hello, there. I'm BONG Dal-Ho. Hi, I'm CHA Seo-Yeon. Nice to meet you. Hey! It wouldn't hurt to make a little conversation. - Yeah, rookie? - What? Rookie? Why? You just started in this business, so I'm like your mentor! - My mentor? - Yeah, we're both Trot singers now. Trot singers? Yeah, whatever. Why are we hiking, anyhow? You need to be fit in order to sing. Jesus, I can't... Didn't they hear of a light morning jog? It's a darn family freak show. My dear Molly Sue... - More feeling! - Will I ever see you again? - My dear Molly Sue. - One more time! Yearning for my Molly Sue! Dal-Ho, you're next. - Yes? - Did you practice? Huh? I don't know what's happened to me. Just don't know what's wrong with me! I just can't grasp... Put emotion in to it and don't shriek! Again! I don't know what's happened to me. - Can't hear you! - Just don't know what's wrong. - Clench your teeth! - I just can't grasp it... - You're sad! You're in sorrow! - I can't understand my sorrow, - Put your hand out! - But I know I need to get over you. - And clench your fist! - I know now we're strangers, - Now, give it a nice snap! - But I don't know why... Tears welled? - Are you playing games here? - Why do I have to snap it? You'll know why, once you do it. Trot music is all about the vibrato! Again, from the last part! - Okay, two, three, four. - But I don't know why. Tears welled up in my eyes. I don't want to act this way. I hate myself for being like this. Me too! I really hate you, too! - What is Trot music to you? - Redneck music! Trot is, the spirit of our hearts and tears. But you're not using your heart at all. Without that spirit, you can't sing Trot. You don't take it seriously enough! 'Cause I'm a rocker! Rock... Not some hillbilly Trot singer. Practice is over. Now, this is the good life. You're done with the countryside jobs? Yes, sir. I even changed my name, to LEE Dae-Su. Did you, now? - Playing with the big fish, eh? - Oh, yes, sir. This new name will take me into the bigger world. Sir, do I have to do Trot music? I'll do anything besides Trot. If not Rock, then how about R&B or hip-hop? - What else? - BONG Dal-Ho! You may not understand it, but I felt something in your voice. Huh? You may not like it, but you just can't hide that. - You're a natural-born Trot singer. - Natural-born? Your face, voice, pitch, ambience... Only Trot will make you a star. Dal-Ho, I'm gonna make you into the king of Trot. The king... of Trot? Wait. First, we need to fix that hair. My hair? No, no, we keep the hair. The hair is off limits. Let's just eat. Aw, come on, man. Feels good, eh? - Dal-Ho. - Yes, sir. All finished, sir. Sheer perfection. Do I really have to go out like this? A singer's stage costume is like a soldier's suit of armor. You'll know it on stage. That feeling you get up there, the lights reflecting off your body. I look like a gay pride parade. Hey, CHA Seo-Yeon. That perfect body line! - Wow, you look good. - You think so? Say, are you single? I'm not interested in that. You should live it up. Fall in love and stuff. Knock yourself out. I'll pass. I'm already living it up, of course. You know what my middle name is? - "Shallow." - Shallow? Yeah, I'm not too deep. But now, I'll be shallow only for you. A shallow river for you to walk across. It means I'll protect you from the harsh waters. A shallow river only for me? That's not too bad. So, let's get pissed and talk more about... - my role as your... - Shh! Wait. One, two, three! It's on! - Dal-Ho, that's the TV station. - Where? The lights go on every day, at this time. You know, I always watch it while I practice. Say, Mr. NA? What's that up front? My signature character, of course. - Dae-Su? - Yes, sir. You need to cleanse yourself of those countryside habits, - or you won't make it in this business. - Oh, sure, sir. That's why I'm serving you, of course. - My dear Molly Sue. - Mr. LEE, why don't you get a job or something, instead of wasting your time here? The thing is, I'm happiest up on the stage singing Trot. - Really? - I guess you don't really like Trot? How could I, sir? It's so tacky. You said you used to do Rock music, right? - Yes, sir! - I'd like to hear it. - Here? Now? - Sure. As the dark rain falls tonight, I will take you away forever. Don't you forget about me! Please wait for me to the end! I believe that music is all connected. How about... something like this? As the dark rain falls tonight, I will take you away forever. Oh, don't you forget about me. Please wait for me, please. Wait for me to the end. I think that everything we feel with our hearts, it's all music. And out of all that music, what I do best is Trot. That's why I'm sitting here, singing Trot. Don't you... That's decent, actually. I don't know what's wrong with me. Crap, something is really wrong with me. Shit, Mom. I seriously need to get pissed tonight. Right, Dal-Ho? This borderline! Nice! Now, who wants to cross this river first? - What the heck is this guy saying? - I'm BONG Dal-Ho! - Hey, that guy's so hot! - He's gorgeous! Gorgeous, my ass. That kind of song needs to come from the gut. You gotta growl! You wanna hear me try it? I'm a lead vocal, you know. What, you don't believe me? - Hey, stop! - What? Guys, let's start with the usual. From the top, guys! Let's go! Get off the stage, jerk! Go home, you drunk! - What are you doing? - You don't know who I am. - Get off. - I'm the lead vocal for City-Rock! Let me sing, damn it! Quiet down, man. - Address. - The penthouse. - In detail! - A 10 square foot penthouse. - Hey, moron! What's your occupation? - I'm a rocker. What the... Actually, my mom runs a small shop back home. BONG's Coffee. When I came up to Seoul, I completely backstabbed my band. 'Cause I thought I'd make it big. But I'm just lying around at home. This guy says I have some dope... - Dope feeling! - What?! I really didn't want to do it, but those crooks, they forced me to... And that big dragon on Mr. JANG's... It's freaking, almost alive... Oh, you haven't seen it. Mr. JANG says I'm a natural, a dope singer... Officer, can I ask you a question? Do you think I'm dope too? JANG Jun, owner of Big Sound Entertainment. - Next. - Marketing Director, CHO Seung-Ho. All right. I'm sorry but Mr. JANG, please lift up your shirt. - Pardon? - Lift up your shirt. - Hey, Detective KIM. - Yes, sir! Run their blood tests and get their hair samples! What for, sir? I have an O blood type. I've done all sorts of things, but I never gave blood at the police station! Why the hell did you drag me into this? Sir, I didn't mean to... - I was drunk... - Drunk?! You're drinking at a time like this? - Mr. CHO! - Yes, sir. - Do we have any schedules set? - Well, I wouldn't call it a schedule, but there's a fair in countryside. And Seo-Yeon is set to sing there. Take him along. You're gonna start from the bottom! But sir... Stuck in my heart, that Shanghai Twist. Thank you! Great show, ma'am. Fantastic. All right then, have a seat now. Now, the moment you've been waiting for, the guest star performance! All the way from Seoul, here on her nation-wide tour, please give it up for new artist, CHA Seo-Yeon! - Let's go, CHA Seo-Yeon! - Your smile shines in the moonlight. It seems just yesterday, I gave you my all. But in the rain of time, that forgetful rain, did you wash my love away? When the rain stops falling, the moon will shine again. Then, just then, will you come back? Will you come back to me? Though this rain falls on my tears, and as it soaks my aching heart, I still can't leave the rain behind. Though it pounds me down, and though it pierces my heart, I think maybe it might be you. Though the rain falls on my tears, and as it soaks my aching heart, I still can't leave the rain behind. The rain that pounds me down, the rain that pierces my heart, I hope maybe it might be you. Congratulations on the first sail of the fisher-boat. All of you in the Camellia. Thank you. It rains every time she sings! - Maybe it's the lyrics. - No, it's only raining over us! Come on, hurry, hurry! You're all wet! - Thank you. - No, no, thank you. - Aren't you cold? - Yeah, a little. I'll warm you up! You poor thing. - What the hell are you doing? - I was just trying to warm her up! Sir, you know when you tour like this and there's two people going, then you get some action with Seo-Yeon. Right? Am I right? She's not that kind of girl. Please, just go to sleep! All right? Oh, I see. Yeah, that makes sense. What was I thinking? Why would she sleep with you? Right? Don't you think so? Right? Huh? Hey, why the pillow... Are you going to her room?! I told you to just go to sleep! Why are you keeping? You like that? Huh? You like being poked like that? - Ow, it stings! - Shut up. What the... TAE Jun-Ah, disgusting jerk. What the hell! He's all over the place! Why are you still in here? I'm your manager. What if someone just rushes in? - Then turn around, at least. - Come on, I'm not gonna look. Go over to the corner and close your eyes. Are you that shy? Then close your eyes while you change. Hey, will you stop acting stupid? Okay, fine. Why are you trying out for this dump? I'd just give it up, if I were you. Soaked in my tears, and this rain, I hope and call out your name. When the rain stops falling, the moon will shine again. Then, just then, - will you come back to... - Hey, stop! Hey, just stop! Get down! I think I'm having a stroke. She's a bit nervous today. Now, that body is such a waste. Forget about singing. You just ain't it. Why don't you work at our club as a call girl instead? I tell ya, it's better money than singing. Come here, eh? Have a seat! Huh? Sit down! Bitch, look at that attitude! Seo-Yeon, let's go. Mr. CHO! - Who the fuck are you? - Me? I'm... - I'm Dal-Ho! - Dal-Ho? So what? Stupid club pimp! What, audition? - A pimp?! - Yeah! You think this is the only club? A call girl? - Let's go, Seo-Yeon! - You fucking nuts? - Yeah, I am, asshole! - You little shit! - Oh my God! Dal-Ho! - Sir, please! Stop! Oh my God! No! - What did you say? Pimp? - On my God! No, please. - Get up! You little! - Dal-Ho! Stupid. Why'd you do that? That jerk! Why, I oughta. Dal-Ho, don't ever do that again, all right? If you do, then I'm done with you. I have to stay shallow, even in a storm. You thought I didn't really mean all that? Your lip is all bleeding. You think I'm crazy too, don't you? - Huh? - You know, my singing. But, you know, I was really good when I was little. I'm serious, Dal-Ho! Dad told me that I sounded just like Barbara Streisand. Whenever he shaved in the morning, I would stand there and sing for him. And every time, he just loved it. When the song was over, he'd give me this cookie from his pocket. Later on, there were times I sang just because I wanted that cookie. - Here, rub this on. - Oh, thank you. Sir, did you get us rooms? Sir, let's just go back home. I won't think of you anymore. I have to forget you once more, I have to forget you once more. Yes! Dal-Ho, you're much, much better! See, Dal-Ho, a singer needs more than a voice. That charming gaze, pitiful face, a delicate hand gesture, and smooth, gliding steps... You get what I'm saying? Watch me do it and try. Imitation is where art begins. Now, hold the mic. Don't clutch it. Hold it gently in your hands and softly hold out your right hand. No! Like this, you see? A little this way. Good. Look forward to the audience. No, a 45 degree angle is best. Then, give them a smile. Right. You're too stiff now. Tighten your buttocks. Hip up! Hip up! Why do you need to pull your hips up? Well, I have no idea. - Sex appeal, my boy! Up! - Ah, sex appeal. Not too much. An artist's hand is like a brush, painting the mood of the song in the air. Think of it as a brush. Watch. I don't know what's happened to me. I just don't know what's wrong with me. - I just can't grasp... - I just can't grasp it. - I can't understand my sorrow. - I can't understand my sorrow, see? Your body should move like silk. Hands, body, everything should flow. Tears are welled up in my eyes. I don't want to act this way. I hate myself for being like this. I need to get you out of my head, now. I have to forget you once more. - He used to do Rock? - Yes, Mr. OH. Then why didn't he just stick to Rock? Oh, he just really wants to do Trot music. No demo, not even a picture of him, and you want a record deal. Is that what you're saying? You still owe me a lot of money. Sir, I'll pay back everything this time. If you don't? No, I will! Please trust me this once. Sir. I've known you for thirty years. I'm putting those thirty years on the line. This will be the last time. - What do you think, Mr. OH? - Well, if you approve, sir. - Then you listen to the kid and decide. - Yes, sir. I will. I won't forget your kindness, sir! This is your last chance. You were so weird when you first came. That cheesy smile and those freaky clothes. That means you like me now. Hey, there's no rush here. Don't get pissed so fast. Pissed? Come on, that's so unrefined. All right. Hey, slow down. Dal-Ho, It rains every time the Native Americans do their rain dance? You know why? Were you there singing with them? You didn't have to do that for 'em who might have not wanted your song. It's because they dance until the rain falls. I thought I could sing until I make it big. That's why I couldn't quit. Until I make it. Seo-Yeon, are you asleep? Yeah, keep sleeping. Seo-Yeon, are you okay? You drank too much. Singers these days... They just quit if they feel like it! I know, sir. Right here. If you just quit, then is that it? Hey! Back in my day, in my... - Seo-Yeon wants to quit. - What? She doesn't want to sing anymore. She was such a hard worker. Mr. JANG tried so hard to make her a star. Seo-Yeon! Practice ran a little late. Hey... - Is it true that you're quitting? - Oh, that... What am I gonna do if you're gone? You're the only reason I stayed here. - Do you have to go? - Don't worry. I'll be back soon. You promise? I'll miss making fun of you too much. So practice hard until I get back, okay? - Wow, it's beautiful! - Yeah, it's great. - Seo-Yeon, let's take a picture. - A picture? Okay. Look here. One, two, three! What... a surprise! A peck on the cheek... We're both adults, - let's do it right. - Oh, hey, get away! Dal-Ho, I really want to thank you. Give it all you got, okay? - Oh, my... - Does it really hurt? - I'm stuck here. - Are you okay? - Don't touch me. - You're really hurt? - Oh, my leg... - Are you okay? Lift your head up! Now, hold a reed in your mouth. Bite it, now. That's good. Lift the hat up a bit. No, no, look here at the camera! Jeez, I look like an idiot. Now, pretend you're kissing a girl. What... What's wrong with these pictures? Hold on. This looks all right. You have such a great eye, sir. Dal-Ho... BONG Dal-Ho. The name doesn't sound right. - We need something cool. - Cool? Those cool names these days... Like U-Know Yoon-Ho, WON Bin, or JANG Dong-Gun, those are cool, eh? U-Know Dal-Ho? JANG Dong BONG? - Or U-Know WON JANG, all together? - I'm sorry I asked. It has to have a feeling like, bam! Of course, sir. Bam! It needs that feeling. A Trot feeling. Sir! How about Trot Feel? Idiot, you call that a name? Are you kidding me? Hey, hold on. BONG Dal-Ho... Trot feel... Bong-Feel, the King of Trot! Now that's something! - You did it! - From now, leave it to me, sir! From this day on, Dal-Ho's name is Bong-Feel! How are all you producers doing? I have here some essentials, - and some energy drinks. - Just leave your card. Oh my, excuse me. He's a new rising star, Bong-Feel. - Again, that's Bong-Feel. - Big Sound Entertainment? Yes, Mr. Producer! Here's the CD. I'm so happy that you're home. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening, sir! We got it! - Nationwide! - Sir? Finally, you're performing on TV! Me? - That's great, sir! - Congratulations, Dal-Ho! - You're so lucky! - Congratulations. Our fates rest on your shoulders. - Wait a minute, sir. - Dal-Ho! You have to come through for us. God, I'm nervous. - Good evening, sir! - Nice to see you, sir. Holy shit! Sir, I'll be forever grateful for giving me - a chance on national... - Shh! Don't make a big deal. Yes, Sir! Shit! What the hell is he doing here? He's not on here. No, right here, Susie, Susie, I'm Sorry! Changed his damn name. Shit, what do I do? Who are you? - Didn't I already do you? - Oh, you did. Actually, could you make it a bit thicker? - All right. - Thank you. - There you go. - Oh, no. I have this situation, and... - Could you just make it thicker? - What? - Uh... I'm here to, uh... - Oh, my head! - To do my make up... - Yes, hold on a sec. - Excuse me? - Oh, don't mind me! God, this migraine! Oh, I forgot my hat. I'll be right back. He's really hurting there. Gave me a heart attack. Please, just make it real thick, so I don't look like myself. Don't you get it? Are you yelling at me? No, I'm not yelling. My parents are against it, so I need a good disguise. I'm sorry, but please help me out. It's done. Thank you so much. What the heck is this? - What's her problem? - Bong-Feel, are you in there? Are you insane? You're on now! Something's in my eye... - Get out here now! - I'll be out, sir. Amateurs. I asked for make up, not some Halloween getup. Goddamn kabuki! I can't go out there like this. We're here at Music Studio, live on air! We have a new, young Trot artist today. - Here's a question. - Yes? Have you heard of Bong-Feel? Bong-Feel? I wonder who that is! Yes, please give a round of applause for the new wave in Trot! Bong-Feel! What do I do... Our new artist, Bong-Feel! Huh? It's Dal-Ho's turn. Did they change it? Yes, he's one very interesting artist. Mr. Bong-Feel! That is your name, right? Oh, yes, it is. - That little... - I didn't know, sir. He's gone nuts! - He's gone nuts! - Is there a reason for wearing this mask? Oh, huh? Oh, a reason? Why, of course. There's a reason... - It's concept. Yeah, concept. - Oh, a concept! - So, it's a mystery! - Yes, that's it! Right there. I see, a mystery. That's interesting! It's time the Trot world tried something new. Call me Bong-Feel, the masked mystery singer. We weren't expecting this, so we're surprised as well. Let's see the performance. It's the masked mystery, Bong-Feel's stage! Please give it up for ! Our last good-bye on this bridge. Even the soft wind grazes my heart. I'm just standing here, crying, unable to stop you. As I stop in my tracks and just stare blankly into the water, it quietly passes me by, leaving me here. - Have you worked here long? - Let me, ma'am. You have a girlfriend? You're so handsome. I'm so sorry, ma'am! That's 20,000 won. Thank you. Isn't that... Hey, mister! Excuse me! The entire country was watching you. Are you insane? Is it a game to you? - I... I was scared and nervous... - You get nervous, so you wear that thing? Take off that mask! I don't even wanna look at it! You're not a part of us anymore. - I made a mistake, sir. - Get out. In my thirty years in this business, I never had to kick someone out. I tried to stick it out with all of you, stick it out through the thick and thin. But this is the last straw. Go. Get out! Everyone else loved it, eh? Stupid, overreacting old farts. You can't kick me out, I quit! I didn't want to do it anyway! Sir! Look at this! He made it! Dal-Ho! I mean masked mystery Bong-Feel! It's a hit! Come on, sir, hurry! It's all over the internet. Everyone's asking who the mask is! Plus, they love ! - What in the world!? It's a miracle! - Hello? Yes. Producer Park! Next week's schedule? Yes, sir! - Mr. Cho! - Yes? Where's our star? How would I know? What are you doing? Go find him! Oh, yes, sir. Just one sec... Hey, Seo-Yeon, it's me, Dal-Ho. Call me when you get this message. I... I really have a lot to tell you. Dal-Ho! What? - What... what's he doing? - Dal-Ho! - Why is he following me? - Hey! Dal-Ho! Oh my God! Dal-Ho! Are you okay? Thank you, Dal-Ho. Thank you so much! You finally did it! Everyone was talking about the new artist that suddenly rose to stardom last week! Yes, here's the masked mystery, Bong-Feel! Please give him a round of applause! Our last good-bye on this bridge. Even the soft wind grazes my heart. I'm just standing here, crying, unable to stop you. As I stop in my tracks and just stare blankly into the water, it quietly passes me by, leaving me here. The only thought in my head is that I can't cross this bridge. With heavy steps, I cross. I turn again and again to see you there, but like a fool, I can't even stop you. At the ends of this bridge, we call out to each other, but we're just too far apart to hear our love. Just crumble apart, instead. So we can never meet again. It breaks my heart to think of our hopeless love. Our love, stuck forever, on this bridge. Why, thank you sir. We just moved our office, that's all. Anyway, you should drop by sometime. Yes, well, thank you. Even the air conditioning is built in! Yes? Oh, sir! Mr. CHOI! Why, of course. For you, we'll make time, sir. Yes, sir! All right. - Mr. CHO! - Yes, sir? Is Dal-Ho busy tomorrow night? Let's see, tomorrow... Yes, he has a schedule in another city. He does? Well, Mr. CHOI wants to meet Dal-Ho. How about another time? But he's only free tomorrow night. Just cancel tomorrow's performance. No, we already advertised it and all! Hey now, it's Mr. CHOI's request! - Dad. - Hmm? - I want his autograph on here. - Oh, of course! - Here you go. - Yes, sir. Say, was the mask your idea? I'm flattered, sir. Dad? I wanna see Bong-Feel's real face. Yes, actually, I'm curious too. Sir! It's a mystery concept... - Please. - It's just us. Please, mister! But it's... All right. Bong-Feel! Take it off. It's okay. Go on. What the heck is that! Mr. JANG! - I see why you put the mask on him. - He's so bald! He's like, older than Dad. Good work. Don't ever take off the mask. Ever. The moment you do take it off, we're all dead. Let's keep the mystery concept. Yes, sir. - Cut down on the expenses! - We're trying, sir. Good to see you again, sir! Who... are you? Don't you remember? We're Dal-Ho's band friends, City-Rock! Oh, what brings you all here? What the... I put this name tag on my heart and stamp true love on my chest. Hold on tight if you'll stay with me! Shh... Quiet down. Don't quit your club gigs, all right? We know Bong-Feel's real identity! Frankly, if people know his past as a second-rate chorus, and his women, Bong-Feel will be history! Yeah, we know everything! Do whatever you want! Crazy idiots. Get out! Who do you think we are? I told you we shouldn't do this. God, you freaking idiots. It's all 'cause you messed up, moron! Say what? This, isn't rocket science. All hail! The rain can't soak the sea. There's only one King of Trot! NA Tae-Song! Hail the king! Sir! Let's just drink it up. My, you're just a dreamboat! Honey, I'll give you drinks on the house if you do me one tiny favor. Yeah? And what's that? Just one autograph. Why, you little fox! It's an honor. Don't you forget it. Now, where do you want it? Oh, no. Not yours, baby. That guy, the masked mystery. I love him! - His song is so good. - I even bought the CD. I heard he's really handsome! I heard he's actually a millionaire! I heard he's really young. Honey, bring the mask here next time. Hey! Did you see him? Did you see if he's good-looking or rich? I heard under that stupid mask, he's shiny bald! How's your mother's health? - Oh, she's fine... - Sir, the press is here. - Oh, they are? - Yes. - Hold on, Seo-Yeon. - Sure. Oh, her? She's a new artist we found. You know, she sings really well. Hey! You two aren't meeting up and all, right? Scandals can kill you these days. Just seconds, and it's just all online! Are you sure you're meeting him today? He's recording late at the studio. Oh, really? I tell ya, he never checks his schedule. How about a quick meeting at the studio? I'll set it up with his manager. CHA Seo-Yeon! Were you here long? - Sit down! - Okay. The taping was over early, but the fans... I had to sign for all of them. I was just about to leave because you seemed busy. Leave? No, you gotta wait for me. Never mind that. How could you be so cold? You didn't even call once. Yeah, I was just busy. Aren't you the masked Bong-Feel? Oh, yes, I am. - Could I get an autograph? - Oh, sure. - Your name is? - I'm Ok-Hee. - Ok-Hee. - I really love your song. I'm a huge fan. I guess this is your girlfriend? Oh, no, we're just friends. Here you go. Hey, Seo-Yeon, did you know this mask concept was my idea? This was my ladder to stardom. Could you take that off, though? Do you have to wear it even with me? What's wrong with it? People don't recognize me if I don't. Why are you so down? You missed me that much, eh? Did you dream of crossing this river? I missed BONG Dal-Ho, not Bong-Feel! Are you nuts? It's not BONG Dal-Ho! People can hear you! Call me Bong-Feel. Dal-Ho. Fine, Bong-Feel How long are you gonna keep this up? Do you think people truly like your music? I don't know why you wear that mask. Do you think they can feel your sincerity? What are you talking about? You sing of love, but you're lying to yourself. Seo-Yeon, it's not like that. Even now, you're ashamed of Trot. - You're lying to all these people. - Hey! BONG Dal-Ho, at least, didn't lie. People are staring. We should leave. I'm gonna go. Seo-Yeon... Please leave a message... - Seo-Yeon? - What? Hello? Answer me! I'ma going to Seoul, Dal-Ho! I'm not saying this again! You do that music crap and I'ma kill ya! He just debuted, and already a scandal?! Just look at what they wrote here! Think how much damage this will do! I'm sorry, sir. Sorry? And you... You set it up for them! Goddamn idiot. What are you gonna do about it? I'll take care of it, sir. Yes, Mr. CHO. I told you, no scandals. - Sir, I didn't... - You should've been more careful! What am I supposed to do now? I'm sorry, sir. Please, help me out here. And Dal-Ho promised he wouldn't see you again. You get what I'm saying, right? Yes, sir. God, this really sucks. Oh, Dal-Ho? When'd you get in? Dal-Ho, you know how I feel, right? He was about to kill me, really! You think I wanted to do this? Hey, Dal-Ho! I haven't changed, Seo-Yeon. I'm the same old BONG Dal-Ho. You're a big star now, and I'm just an ordinary girl. In life, sometimes we have to give up and pretend everything is fine, and just give in. Don't say that. Seo-Yeon, what Mr. CHO said was... I know what you want to say. We've both changed a lot. What's changed so much? - I have to go. - Seo-Yeon! Dal-Ho, I'm really sorry if I somehow got in your way or anything like that. Don't call me again. And don't come here either. Good-bye, Dal-Ho. Seo-Yeon! Hey, Seo-Yeon! Why did ya leave home anyway, eh? Ain't it 'cause you're done with me? - I was about to call... - Don't bullshit me! And where's all this from? What is all this?! Are you a drug peddler?! - Mom... - You lost it! Do you think I've changed too? I said, what's all this mess! I should've told you before. I'm the masked mystery, Bong-Feel. That's me! What? What you blabbering about? The mask was 'cause I was ashamed. But Mom, I'm... I'm... I'm still your son, aren't I? I haven't changed at all! Goodness, I think ya changed a lot, you fool! Our last good-bye on this bridge. Even the soft wind grazes my heart. - I'm just standing here... - That fool's gone crazy, now! Hey, it's pink today. I heard he has one in mesh. Good afternoon. Oh, goodness gracious! - What the hell are you? - Excuse me? I said, what are you! - I'm a singer. - A singer? You call hiding under that rag, singing? - Take it off. - Huh? No, I can't. You can't? What happened to this industry, eh? A true singer wins solely with his music. Don't disgrace the stage anymore. Go on, fool! It's ! I hate that guy. What's with the mask? Isn't it all just a publicity stunt? That's such a lame excuse. Cut the guy some slack. I get where he's coming from. Everyone's got a mortgage to pay, right? - All right, cheers! - Bottoms up. So, you asked Mr. JANG to hire us? Thanks, man. I knew we could count on you. BONG Dal-Ho! You ditched us for Seoul, and for what? That stupid Trot music? Come on, guys. Fill 'em up, all right? Let's get pissed off our asses tonight! Pissed? Don't act so unrefined. I can't believe my ears. Is this really Dal-Ho? Anyway, we'll start rocking - when you're back... - Guys. Trot, it's some tasty music. Does genre matter that much? If people listen, smile, and clap along with you, then that's good music. Where'd you pick up a line like that? Please leave a message... Say, Producer Kim, - about the Music Awards... - Yes? I know Bong-Feel will get the New Artist Prize, but it won't affect me winning Grand Prize, right? Well, the thing is... it's all done real-time, by phone, so... I seriously can't do this. I'm not nervous, I'm just embarrassed! You're embarrassed? I know just what to do. Moron. What do you know about love? She broke my heart and left me, with only these scars and pain to bear. Were we lovers, only for that one night? That was an exciting performance! Now, our next artist is another strong contender for the title. Yes, he won Grand Prize two years in a row! A big round of applause for Mr. NA Tae-Song! A man's life is an endless quest for victory. One false move, and before you know it, he's history. Bong-Feel! Bong-Feel! - Already, the crowd is going wild! - Yes! He's the new sensation in music, here with a special chorus today! Yes, singing , here's Bong-Feel! Bong-Feel! Our last good-bye on this bridge. Even the soft wind grazes my heart. Why the heck are they in masks too? You can't tell who's who! - Did you tell them to? - Oh, no, sir! - Tell them not to wear it next time! - Yes, sir! As I stop in my tracks and just stare blankly into the water, it quietly passes me by, leaving me here. The only thought in my head is that I can't cross this bridge. With heavy steps, I cross to that side. I turn again and again to see you there, but like a fool, I can't even stop you. At the ends of this bridge, we call out to each other, but we're just too far apart to hear our love. Just crumble apart, instead. So we can never meet again. It breaks my heart to think of our hopeless love I want to thank everyone for all the love and support you've shown for the masked mystery, Bong-Feel. To be honest, I wore this mask because I was ashamed of singing Trot music. But now, I can sing with my head held high. Although she's not with me now, I dedicate this song to the one who taught me about true love and music Just crumble apart, instead. So we can never meet again. It breaks my heart to think of our hopeless love. Our love, stuck on this bridge. Now, the moment you've been waiting for! It's time to announce the Grand Prize! Will NA Tae-Song take it home again, or will the rising star receive the honor? Yes, I wonderjust what results tonight's unmasking of Bong-Feel's identity will bring. I'm getting more nervous. Let's see who will win. And now, on with the announcement. With 64%, a total of 24,568 votes! The 2006 Music Awards Grand Prize! The Grand Prize goes to... The masked mystery singer, Bong-Feel!

You remember my boy! My boy carried a mighty tune since he was born! Jesus, I'm gonna suffocate in this! Seo-Yeon! Leaving me here. The only thought in my head is that I can't cross this bridge.
