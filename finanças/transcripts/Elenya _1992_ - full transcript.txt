(plane engine roars) (tense music) - [Woman] Dear Julie Price, thank you for your letter. I'm afraid it took a long time to reach me. The post in my part of Italy is bad. I'm so glad your Uncle Sidney thought of me, although he knows I didn't have much to do with village life during the war. Still, I suppose that title covers a lot of ground. Of course I'll try to help, but I must tell you that I haven't thought of Wales for many years, and there's little chance that I'll ever go back. - [Radio Narrator] I expect that most of you will have heard already today the news that the British Army has been in action in-- - [Man] See, Ellie, I told you we'd do it. - [Elenya] Yes. - [Radio Narrator] But in contact with German troops for the first time. The release of this news, which has been a closely guarded secret for several days, automatically discloses the fact that a force of British troops has taken its place in a sector of the Maginot line, side-by-side with the French, and face-to-face with the Germans. It has been my good fortune to see something of the troops involved. So far, they have represented country regiments, with detachments and technical experts from other Army formations on special duty. (somber music) (muffled radio chatter) - [Elenya] Here, Dad. (wind howls) (strong wind blows) - Here, it's yours now! Go on! You're strong enough, that's it! Nice and tight. Go on! (strong wind blows) (string snaps) (ominous music) Oh, Christ! (birds tweet) - [Elenya] We lived in the cottage near the end of the bridle path to the Williams' farm. It seemed so big at the time. - [Father] We'll say nothing to Auntie Maggie. - [Elenya] There was me, my father, and Auntie Maggie in those days. - You should've seen the dawn, Maggie. - Your breakfast's cold on the table. - [Elenya] My mother had gone by then. (gate squeaks) And all around us, there were the woods. (somber music) (muffled arguing) - [Maggie] This is my home! - [Father] And this is my home and this is Ellie's home! She's Ellie's mother! - Don't you talk about her again. You always think of her. Why do you never think of your sister? Why do you never remember me? (door clunks) (muffled radio chatter) (brush scrapes) - [Radio Narrator] And it is this fact which has... (bucket clangs) Of the younger generation... (brush scrapes) (muffled radio chatter) That it has found our young folk more ready to serve their country in arms, in its service of a cause than ever they were or could have been roused to be, for any imperial interest. (muffled radio chatter) - [Elenya] I'm glad your Uncle Sidney encouraged you to write. He sold the house when Maggie died a few years ago. I don't know if anyone's living there now. You know more about her as an old lady than I do. We lived a simple life then. We heard about people in the village like Albert Thomas joining up. Maggie blamed Dad for being out of work, but people forget good carpentry when war comes along. Everything was easier when my father was at home. I remember the day he left. (somber music) The first lie he ever told me. - It's just a few weeks, Ellie. Until I find the work. Then I'll be back. (sighs) Maggie loves you, Ellie. Deep down. Try and love her back a little, eh? Promise you'll try? - I promise. (somber music) (water splashes) - I'll be back before you know it. I'll write once I'm set. (distant thunder rumbles) (clock ticks) (footsteps recede) - After that, the house was different. (water drips) Dark and still. Maggie and I weren't great talkers. He forgot his cap. - Glyn won't come back now. (birds tweet) - [Elenya] I don't know if any of this is helpful. My memory isn't good. I remember kites. Sitting at night in my window. Cutting up newspaper articles next to the fire. Most of all, the woods and the paths I made. Narrow and winding, so nobody could follow. (peaceful music) (birds tweet) (wings flap) (joyful jazz music) - You lay a good fire. Just like Glyn. - [Elenya] Could I have a candle, just for tonight? - I'm not your father, Elenya. It's time you got used to the dark. - [Elenya] I went to school with your Uncle Sidney. There were two classes then. I wasn't much of a pupil, always late for everything, and they teased me because of my name, and because I didn't have a proper family. (bell rings) - Hurry along now, children! Those bombs could be real this time. Off you go. Come along, Elenya. Good girl. (distant children yell) (knocks) Elenya is an unusual name. Italian. Greek, maybe. Well, she's certainly a strange little thing. But then, living without your real mother can't be easy, can it? (knocks) (door creaks) Have you heard from your father yet? Well, you'll have news soon, I'm sure. - Will the war get to us? - Don't be silly, they don't have wars here. (sheep bleat) (peaceful music) - Whatever are you doing? I'm late already. I've left carrots in the sink, peel them properly this time. - I hate you. I hate you, I hate you. - Ellie! Ellie! (hurried footsteps approach) I shouted. - Didn't hear. - Liar. - So? - My dad lets me label the medicines now, even the poisons. Want to come and see? (door creaks) - [Elenya] I think Sidney had an eye for me. Well, I shouldn't exaggerate, we were very young then. I took advantage from the start, I'm afraid. (suspenseful music) - Look. Up there. It's strychnine and cyanide. Dad keeps them all on top so no one can touch. (crystals rattle) Look. Copper sulfates. Little blue crystals. You can grow them like plants, if you want. Prettier than jewelry. (birds tweet) (crystals rattle) Maybe he'll join up. - Who? - Your dad. They'd stop teasing you then. Stands to reason, if he killed lots of Germans, he'd be a hero. - I told you never to touch the chemicals! Who are you? - She's Ellie, she's-- - [Father] Be quiet! Oh, you're the Italian, aren't you? Out. Out of this house, before I call the police! - [Elenya] Sidney is a very loyal, kind man. In the end, he did turn against me because he had to. He didn't know everything. What happened was perfectly natural in war. And, of course, I was a foreigner. (suspenseful music) (birds tweet and coo) (rock scrapes) (distant sirens wail) War was great fun at first. We all loved the urgency of it all. It was dangerous, exciting. But we got bored with practicing. We longed for a real plane to come along. - I wish I could draw like that. - Like what? - So where's your dad gone then, Ellie? To find another foreign lady? (screams) - Elenya, Phil! I'll see you after school. (birds tweet and squawk) - Why don't you run away? - I promised my dad I'd love Auntie Maggie. - You're funny. - Why'd you do that? - 'Cause you're a girl and I'm a boy. (owl hoots) (distant guns fire) (distant plane engine roars) (explosion roars) (fire crackles) (hushed chatter) - That's two less Germans for us to kill, thank God. (hushed chatter) (fire crackles) You don't know what war is. Elenya? Elenya! (distant birds hoot) - Sweet Jesus, make me love her. (distant rumbling) (tense music) (fire crackles) (explosions roar) (guns fire) (distant scream) (distant scream) (birds tweet and hoot) (distant scream) (blood drips) (pots clack) (cutlery clinks) (door slams) - Where have you been? - Nowhere. - [Maggie] Is that where all that mud's come from, nowhere? - I went back to the field, to see what they'd found in the wreckage. - Well? - They were all burnt alive. - They should've been all wrung out yesterday. (mangle creaks) (somber music) (water splashes) (mangle creaks) (Elenya sighs) - No, I don't remember his other name, I'm afraid. I don't think I was ever told. Everyone must wonder why I did it. Maybe it was just instinct. But between you and me, there was more to it than that. Even at the start. (suspenseful music) (birds tweet and squawk) (wings flap) Please don't be dead. (bird squawks) (wings flap) (grunts) (suspenseful music) (cloth tears) (wings flap) (birds tweet) (man groans) (man mumbles in foreign language) Shh. (birds tweet) (leaves rustle) (hums melodically) (somber music) What's your name? Elenya. Me, Elenya. You. Your name? - Franz. Franz. - Franz. (birds tweet) (leaves rustle) (dog barks) (gate creaks) - Where were you this time? (Elenya yelps) Selfish, deceitful, just like that slut, your mother! - Let go of me, I don't belong to you! I don't even like you, I hate you! Do you hear? And Dad. Both of us hate you, we've hated you for years. (Maggie sobs) (distant dog barks) (clock ticks) (sheep bleat) (birds tweet) It was early summer. Very warm and sunny. And I had my secret. (birds tweet) (gun cocks) (flies buzz) (Franz pants) (flies buzz) (somber music) (brook babbles) (birds tweet) (hums melodically) (birds tweet) (Franz speaks foreign language) I'm sorry. (Franz speaks foreign language) I'm trying not to hurt! (Franz gasps) (Franz groans) (Franz pants) (Franz speaks foreign language) (Franz groans) (Franz speaks foreign language) I could smell damp and decay all around. I decided I'd have to do a lot more to save him. That day, my new life began. I became a liar and a thief. Sorry about yesterday. (somber music) Do you like them? - Thank you, Elenya. - I really do love you, Maggie. Both of us. Both of us love you so much. (pants) (giggles) (birds tweet and squawk) (zipper scrapes) I'll turn around, if you like. Go on, dress. My eyes are quite shut. (birds tweet and squawk) (zipper scrapes) (razor scrapes) (brook babbles) (birds tweet) (flies buzz) (Franz speaks foreign language) We must bury everything! (Franz speaks foreign language) I'm sorry. (wings flap) (birds squawk) (tense music) I'm gonna keep you here, until the war is over. (birds tweet and squawk) (leaves rustle) (somber organ music) You'll be safer here. (fire crackles and pops) (birds tweet) Do you know any English, Franz? - Hm? - English. English words. (sighs) Suppose not. Here, you have the rest. (Franz chuckles) (Franz speaks foreign language) (Franz speaks foreign language) Don't worry. I won't leave you. I'll be back. Tomorrow. (Franz sighs) (Franz speaks foreign language) Tomorrow. (door clacks) - Look. Oranges. Sidney came again while you were out. Had them wrapped under his coat. Lord knows where he got them. I didn't dare ask. This is your treat. You've been so good today. Here. You have the other one. (door clacks) (birds tweet) (Franz chuckles) (distant thunder rumbles) (rain splashes) - People asked me afterwards, "Didn't you know about hospitals and prisoner of war camps?" I think I must have. But in the wood, it was different. Even school didn't exist. (distant thunder rumbles) (melancholy music) This is your home, isn't it? (Franz speaks foreign language) You live by the sea? (Franz speaks foreign language) A lake! You live by a lake. (Franz speaks foreign language) I don't understand. I don't understand! (Franz mutters in foreign language) (distant thunder claps) (leaves rustle) (birds tweet) (somber music) A week had passed. Flecks of blood in the white of his eyes. How his leg bent out next to his stick. I can still remember those things. As I walked home, I suddenly saw my father again in the cottage. The first time I'd thought about him in a month. - [Maggie] You should have made her stay! - [Glyn] How could I make her stay? We know she had to leave! - [Maggie] Yes and I've had to bring Ellie up! - [Glyn] I didn't ask you to do this. - [Maggie] How can you talk about her again in this house? - [Glyn] She's her mother. - Running away, a child just born, call that being a mother? - [Glyn] Little Ellie. - You always think of her. Why do you never think of your sister? Why do you never remember me? (lock clinks) (birds squawk) (Elenya sighs) (suspenseful music) (leaves rustle) (music swells and intensifies) (somber music) A dark mustache, you say? I know who it was. Evan Williams. He had a dark mustache. Hung himself from the big beech. 10 years ago. Let that be a lesson to you for wandering about in the night. - Maggie didn't mean it. It's a target for the soldiers, no more than that. - [Elenya] Maggie used to terrorize us both. But all my work in the wood made me tougher. Remember, my father was gone without a trace. On my own, I had to stand up to her now. (knife scrapes) (birds tweet) (water drips) (pants) (objects clatter) Where are they? What have you done with them? - You're mad, you've gone mad, what're you talking about? - They've gone, Dad's things! His cap, everything! - Glyn's never coming back, do you hear? Never! (cutlery clinks) (muffled thunder claps) - It was a trick. All of it. - Whatever do you mean? - There was no job for him to find. There never was. It was all a lie. Say it. - Your father went off to find her. How can I be expected to take care of you forever? I told him as much! But I never thought he'd go through with it. How can he find her after all these years? (somber music) This came last week. - [Elenya] He's fighting in France. - Fool of a man. Couldn't face coming back to me without her. (Elenya mumbles) (explosions roar) (music intensifies) (Elenya speaks foreign language) (distant guns fire rapidly) (Franz yells) (Elenya gasps) - Sweet Jesus. Keep me away from the woods. A month or six weeks had gone by, local defense volunteers tramped the lanes with rusty bayonets. Jam making was advised for the women. Patriotism in full flight. You must be thinking this was when I should've left him for good. I think I stayed away just a week. (children chatter over each other) (birds tweet) (peaceful music) - [Franz] Elenya! Elenya! - [Maggie] Elenya? Elenya! - Elenya! Elenya! - [Elenya] Oh, God. Infection. (Franz groans) - [Franz] Sulphonamide. Sulphonamide. Sulphonamide. (groans) - I'll be back. (pants) (tense music) (glass clinks) "Sulphonamide." (pants) (Franz moans) (pants) (Franz moans) (Franz sighs) (birds tweet) (distant plane engine roars) (hums melodically) (leaves rustle) I'll be back. Very soon. - Why? - Because you came. You came here, to me. (leaves rustle) (birds tweet) (distant dog barks) (clock ticks) Auntie Maggie? - I thought you'd run away. - [Elenya] Autumn was near, the wood sounded different. You could see further through the trees. How long before the end? Far away, the war went on. One day, it even came back to our village. Sidney was in his element. - Must've tried to dump his bombs, before he went down. Didn't care who they fell on. Bloody Nazi animal. You know what Germans say when they kill? They say (speaks foreign language), like the bark of a dog. I read that in a book. - And you'd know all about that, wouldn't you, Ellie? Being a foreigner. (Elenya yelps) (children laugh) (Elenya shouts in foreign language) (Elenya shouts in foreign language) (sheep bleat) (brook babbles) (birds tweet) (Franz hums melodically) (branch snaps) (gun cocks) (wings flap) (tense music) - [Elenya] Is this stuff any use? I can't remember the feeling of it now. If I did, I'd tell you the secret. Although, it doesn't have much to do with the war. I can picture it. But I can't see me in the picture, somehow. Dad's clothes. (pants) (objects scrape) (pants) (water splashes) (fire crackles) (Maggie snores) (Maggie chokes) (fire crackles) (Maggie snores) (birds tweet) (door thuds) (sighs) (birds tweet and squawk) (Franz whistles) - Huh? (chuckles) Good? Like? (speaks foreign language) Huh? - Do you love her very much? (Franz speaks foreign language) Her! Your fancy woman! (Franz speaks foreign language) (somber music) (Franz speaks foreign language) (brook babbles) Even when she's being cruel she's frightened. She knows I'll leave one day, then she'll be all on her own. She'll have no one, but I can't mind that, can I? I can't live for her, I've got to live for me. (somber music) (Franz speaks foreign language) (owl hoots) (leaves rustle) One day, I'll take you there. When the war is over. (Franz chuckles) (hums melodically) (objects clack) The glass necklace was the only thing that came from the woods and into the house, but I didn't keep it for long. I didn't want to remember that day. (distant dog barks) (distant birds squawk) - It's your father, my dear. Three whole weeks ago. (bleak music) - [Elenya] No! No! - School tomorrow, thank goodness. We must learn to forget him, you see. It's quite simple, just put him right out of our heads. (switch squeaks) (door clicks) (muffled footsteps recede) (Elenya sighs) - Dead. Dead. Dead. (explosions rumble) (guns fire rapidly) (fire crackles) (guns fire rapidly) (rain splashes) I'm gonna stab Evan Williams. I'm gonna stab Evan Williams to death. I'm gonna stab Evan Williams. I'm gonna stab Evan Williams to death. The end of the holidays. Three months after he came. (birds tweet) - My dad says whenever you want to come round for afternoon tea, you'd be welcome. - Thanks. - My Auntie Mabel went when I was two. - For afternoon tea? - No, I mean died. - Oh. - Mind you, I don't remember her. I've only got this picture of her sitting on a beach. - See those big trees over there? That's where I go. - [Sidney] What do you mean? - His name is Evan Williams, you remember, Sidney? Hung himself from the big beech, 10 years ago. - You're strange, you are, you know. You've really gone funny. (hurried footsteps recede) (flames crackle) - First frost. Feel it in my bones. (flames roar and crackle) - No, no! (owl hoots) (pants) (gun cocks) I'm sorry. Look. See what I've brought you. Sorry. Sorry. (Franz speaks foreign language) (birds tweet) (somber music) (Franz snores) I thought I'd lost this cup forever. When you turn it, you see horsemen riding through the woods. I won't be a minute. (coughs) (vomit splashes) (glass shatters) (pants) (suspenseful music) (glass clinks) (bird squawks) - Can we come, too? - What did you tell him? - It's a deserter. You're keeping a deserter. My dad was right about you. (glass clinks and smashes) (bird squawks) - [Elenya] All right. (Franz breathes heavily) - Who are you? You're a deserter, aren't you? A bloody rotten coward, that's what you are. - [Sidney] Look. (tense music) - A foreigner? A German? Looks like you were in a bit of a scrap. Does it hurt then, hm? Nazi? Does it hurt then, hm? Or there, Nazi? There, Na-- (Franz screams) (boy screams) (Franz breathes heavily) (bird squawks) (somber music) - [Elenya] Yes, I stayed with him. The night was very dark, I lay beside him. I remember his breathing, slow and mechanical. In the end, I must've slept. (Franz speaks foreign language) (sobs) Then the war really came to our village. I remember telling myself not to worry. No one would find us. Who would bother? I was wrong, of course, they came. They'd been waiting long enough. (glass shatters) (distant dogs bark wildly) (suspenseful music) They're coming. (distant dogs bark wildly) (pants) (Franz pants) (Franz speaks foreign language) (dogs bark) (leaves rustle) (dogs bark) (leaves rustle) (wings flap) (dogs bark) (leaves rustle) (birds squawk) - Sorry. (Elenya yelps) (distant dogs bark) (water splashes) (distant dogs bark) (hushed chatter) (water splashes) (somber music) (hushed chatter) - Franz! Franz! - Come back! - Franz! (dogs snarl) (dogs snarl) (dogs snarl) (lock clacks) (clock ticks) - My life is over, you see. Quite over. (pot clangs) (Elenya groans) Foreigner, traitor, slut! (distant dog barks) (clock ticks) (switch clicks) (door clunks) (muffled footsteps recede) - Is he dead? (sighs) I knew he was dead. (birds tweet) (cart clunks) Yes, I've been quite successful. My life in Italy is very busy and I don't dwell in the past. But your letter has reminded me of moments, sometimes at night, when I open my eyes and see him again. (distant church bell tolls) - You'll like your time in the town. It's different, of course. It's full of strangers. But the Howells are a nice family. You'll soon settle down. Time heals. - Is it the war, all this? - You loved him very much, didn't you? It's not just the war, Elenya. There's always pain. (wind blows) - No one ever told me where he was buried. But I do know where I last saw him alive. Sometimes I think of going there. I killed him. Quite thoughtlessly, but with real affection. That's my story. Now you can judge me. I love you. I love you. I love you. I really hope all this helps you. Send my love to your uncle. With best wishes, Alenya Howell. (somber music)
