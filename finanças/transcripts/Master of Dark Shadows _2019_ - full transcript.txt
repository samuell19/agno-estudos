- I think there's something very magical about "Dark Shadows." We kind of fell into it. I was always fascinated by those kinds of stories, but "Dark Shadows" evolved into something I never really planned on. It's its own world. It's a magical world in that nothing that happens today, no matter when we were doing the show, ever intruded on the show. If there was a war going on, you don't know about it in Collinsport, Maine. It exists in a world of its own. And the key to the whole thing is this incredible, fantastical, magical love story that spans time. - Dan Curtis was the macabre mind behind "Dark Shadows," a soap opera that dared to infuse the daily format's usual melodrama and romance with vampires, ghosts, and a brooding Gothic atmosphere. But during its relatively brief time on air, "Dark Shadows" stoked a feverish base, which like Barnabas Collins himself, spanned generations. - I hate people who make lists. That's what I hate about the Oscars. All these people bring out this list of 400 people they want to thank. But I have my own list. It's not that long. I put down 10 things about Dan Curtis that I feel summarize the man. Impatient. Creative. - Brilliant. - Pragmatic. - Energetic. - Commanding. - A very, very strong personality. - Demanding. - Focused. - Tough. - Tough guy attitude. - Hard working. - He called it like it was. - Loyal. Dedicated. - Him and I got along great. - There was something romantic about him and something, something... dreadful. - Stubborn, and proud. - And I was terrified of him. - Behind all of that kind of... that cloak of kind of largesse and everything, there's this very vulnerable person. I was very conscious of that. There was this extremely vulnerable person behind it all. He couldn't have been so intuitive without it. But he had this stunning duality. - He grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His father was a dentist. He really didn't talk too much about his childhood, actually. I think that his mother was very dear to him. And I think after he lost his mother, I never heard stories growing up about family life. - When he was 13, his mother died suddenly in the middle of a sentence to him. She had an aneurysm. - And he was right there in the car. And she was pulled out of the car and put on the pavement. And I think this was the defining factor of his life. - And his father didn't really know what to do with him, and so he got sent to boarding school for a year. I think he turned that really into a strength, just the confidence that he had on himself and how he just trusted himself more than he would trust other people's ideas. - My parents met at Syracuse University, in 1950, I believe. And after they graduated, they got married two years later. My mother was very creative, and my father trusted her intuition inherently. She did believe in him very much so. They were quite a team. - What really struck me in looking back was the incredible commitment and loyalty. - Shortly after moving to Chicago with his wife Norma, Dan began working as a salesman. And while he had not originally aspired to a career in television, one of the first jobs he landed was at NBC. - I used to be a salesman. I was selling syndicated junk to the local television stations. And they were awful. So I always used to say things like, "If I couldn't do it better than these dumb bastards, I'd give up the business." - He certainly never liked anybody telling him what to do. He didn't want to work for a network. And he wanted to be his own man. - Curtis decided the best place to launch his own production company was New York City. He and Norma made the move, but success did not come without a struggle. - I got myself a little office. It was a penthouse office, I called it. It was a storage room at the top of 119 West 57th Street. You had to walk out on to an outside fire escape to get up to a fire door to get into the room. Room was filled with junk. I had $300 left in a checking account. I couldn't make the next mortgage payment on the house. I had $10,000 in unpaid bills in a big cardboard box. - Despite having little to his name, Dan had what he thought was a solid gold pitch, inspired by one of his passions in life-- golf. Beautiful shot. - He felt he had this great idea for a golf show. And so he convinced my mother that he would stop working-- so now nobody was working-- and he had a year to try and sell this. And he kept getting rejected. He claims he had literally 300 rejections. It was CBS that called him and said, "OK, Dan, we're going to do it. And we'll pay you $50,000." And my mother is sitting next to him. And he says, with no money in his pocket, "I will not do it for anything less than $150,000." My mother, when she told the story, she just wanted to kill him. - And I sold it. I pulled it out. It's a great story. I pulled it off the last second. It was called "The CBS Golf Classic." It stayed on the air for 10 years and I suddenly had my own company. - "CBS Television Sports presents 'The CBS Match Play Golf Classic.'" - The success of the program stoked Dan's creative spark into a fire that made him eager to plunge deeper into the field of television. - My father, out of all the people I've ever met, I never saw him not working or trying. He had a script in front of him, rewriting. He had books-- he was always reading books, reading scripts. He always was looking for his next idea. - Dan refused to play by the rules. Dan was meeting with a Vice-President of ABC. And this person was sitting with back to the doorway. I wasn't part of that meeting, but I had to pass by to get to my office. The shirt collar-- stiff shirt collar-- was drooping and dripping with sweat. - Dan's no-nonsense approach did not always make him popular with the network executives. His gruff personality once even got him banned from the set of his own show. - Dan and I were in a taxi, and he had still been working on the "CBS Golf Classic." And they forbid him to come on the scene. They said he couldn't come on the set. He's out. And I turned around and looked at him and he was crying. That was a very bad time for him. He had his wife, he had his two girls. In the meantime, Dan was always working, always planning something. He wanted to do a soap opera. - That's the way I want to live. - You're a wonderful person, Joe. - Thank you, ma'am. - Soap operas started on radio and they were extremely popular there. And they came over to TV as one of several genres that made the transition successfully. And it was an easy transition, because they were very talky. It was relatively cheap to produce. - Soap operas began as a housewife's medium. - "Mrs. Cliche is always found in the kitchen next to a washing machine. Her uniform: shirtwaist dress, half apron, smile." - Radio understood, and certainly early television understood, that it was the working mother who needed some type of relief from the daily chores. And they created the soap operas, obviously soap being one of the main sponsorships of the form. - "You'll know that it's Holsum your very first bite." - One night, I had a dream. It was a girl on a train. And she was riding along a rocky coastline. I can remember waves smashing on the rocks. And in the dream, I knew that somehow she was being hired as a governess to work in this big house. The train drops her off at the little one-horse station. It's nighttime. And she steps out onto the empty platform and the train pulls away into the darkness and the mist. And she's standing there all alone. And I woke up. My wife was awake. And I had been thinking about it as I was shaving. And I thought that this great idea that I had during the night was garbage. It was ridiculous and didn't make any sense at all. - And he told my mother, who was very influential whether things were a good idea or not, and she's like, "Danny, Danny, I love it!" - The big question was where to shop the concept. There were only three major American television networks at the time, and ABC was regularly in last place. - They didn't have the stable that CBS and NBC had. They needed daytime programming. ABC was operating in a bit of a handicap economically in those days. - The network was trying to build a serial soap opera block in the afternoon, and this was the last half hour before the network stopped programming and the local stations took over and it was also a time of day when youngsters began to influence viewing. - This youth audience, which is always a prized demographic for television because young people are more susceptible to branding images, they're less set in their ways as consumers, and they have a lot of power and influence over where their parents spend their money. - A journey that would bring me to a strange and dark place, to the edge of the sea, high atop Widow's Hill, a house called Collinwood. - I did not envision this brilliant idea of mine, this dream that I had, as being a daytime show. Daytime shows were people sitting in kitchens. - I was asleep. It was very early in the morning, and my phone rang in my apartment in New York. And a man named Dan Curtis called me. And he said, "I have to see you." - And I told him about this idea and how I thought what a great nighttime show it would make. "What a great idea! Let's do it in the daytime." I said, "Oh, it's not a daytime show. This thing isn't a soap." - And Dan was a very powerful salesman, but he also sparked something in me. - By the end of the meeting, we shook hands and I don't know why I had said to him, "OK, all right, we'll do this as a daytime show." Writer Art Wallace was brought on board to come up with the story. He titled the treatment, "Shadows on the Wall," which was inspired in part by a script he had written called "The House" for the 1950s mystery anthology series "The Web." - "'The Web' comes to you live from New York. Tonight, a story called 'The House,' the story of this house in New England; the two women who lived in it; and the stranger who brought back their past." - Living here with my thoughts in this horrible house. - But you love the house. - And now that Pa's home-- - He's not your father. Your father's dead. I killed him. - We didn't know what we were going to call the show. Somebody came up with "Shadows on the Wall" and I didn't like that title. And I was just-- "Oh, I've got to come up with a title that makes sense, something like 'Dark Shadows' would be good." And somebody said, "Well, shadows are always dark." I said, "Not necessarily. There are light shadows as well. 'Dark Shadows'-- that kind of says it all." - I went up to meet Dan. There he was, really looking like Dan, about 90 teeth. He had 900 teeth in here, like that. And when he was happy, he would gleam his teeth at you, like this. We spoke for about 15 minutes. And he said, "OK, you're it. I want you to do this." Well, I learned subsequently that Dan was a person who wanted instant gratification. He was very impatient right away. He says to me, "How soon can I hear the theme?" Well, fortunately, about a week later, I was shaving one morning, right in the middle, I heard, [singing theme]. I thought, that's it. So I got down there. And he said, "OK, how are we going to hear this? Have we got a piano?" I said, "I'm just going to whistle it to you." And I went [whistle]. And he looked at me and his teeth are just like this-- and he said, I-- I can't say that word. He said, "I really love it!" He said, "OK, when can I hear it with the orchestra?" - "It is to this isolated old mansion high on Widow's Hill that 20-year-old Victoria Winters has come to probe the mystery of her past." - "Dark Shadows" first crept into American homes on June 27, 1966. - I had worked in soap operas before as the commercial coordinator. So I knew sort of what I was getting into I thought. Little did I know what this show would actually become. - It was a Gothic romance, and it was about this eccentric family, the Collins family, in Collinwood, very wealthy, sister and brother living together. And of course, that was legendary film star Joan Bennett and then Louie Edmonds. And the story was really "Jane Eyre." - I'm Victoria Winters. Is Mrs.-- - Come in, Ms. Winters. - If you look back into TV Guide when "Dark Shadows" launched in late June of 1966, not much was mentioned of the Gothic appeal. It was just the governess taking care of a 10-year-old. You would have no idea of what was to come. - A chauffeur tells a desk clerk, who tells a housekeeper, who tells me that you're going to work up in Collinwood. That makes you a jerk. - But why? - At that time, the soap opera was hardly a format synonymous with groundbreaking television. - There's one born every minute. - It was not considered a high art. And I think that from an acting perspective, it's basically considered something that you start with in order to learn the business on the job. - "Oh, you want to do a soap opera?" And I said, "No." I mean, I really didn't want to do a soap opera. I was on to a different kind of career that I was seeking. I know what it's like to be locked up. It's dark and bare and lonely. Remember, I'm right outside if you need anything. - Soap operas in those days, it was just people sitting at coffee tables knocking knees and talking about who was getting a divorce and that sort of thing. It was just very mundane. - I felt at that time that I had missed the boat. I was 28, 29 years old. And I said, it's all over. I'm not going to make it. I get this call to replace somebody on this television show. And I mistakenly took the job. Atta boy. Now you're talking like a real ex con. - It is regrettable that some people have this, oh, you just worked on soap operas. I said, if you really knew how hard we work-- I mean, we were basically doing an entire production in a day and turning around and doing it the next day. - I mean, soap operas... You worked your butt off and you didn't make any money. - You need ice water in your veins to do a soap opera because you have so little rehearsal. - There were usually only five characters on each episode. And so we had a lot to do on the days that you were on. - We started at 8 o'clock in the morning with a walk-through with script in hand. - We had a camera blocking around 10:00, and that was after doing the blocking up in the rehearsal room. And then we had what we called a stumble-through. - Run it two or three times, and go into makeup and hair. Get in our fabulous costumes. - I don't think we actually had a break for lunch. I don't think the actors ever got outside that little studio. - And then we had a dress rehearsal. You'd get notes or lines would be cut or all kinds of things would happen after a dress rehearsal. And you were going on to do the show live. And then we just taped it. - It was all one half hour shot. And we had to finish on time because they started the 4 o'clock news. - That adds an element of suspense and-- what?-- fear to the day. - What is that sound? - The wind. Or the widows. - Some actors navigated the rough waters of live on tape dramatic television better than others. - ... Moaning with grief as they have for hundreds of years. - I've seen men forget their line on a live show and they'd be as dry as you are now. And one second later, the sweat would be pouring off their face. They had forgotten their line completely. And somewhere along the way, somebody threw it to them and they kept on going. But live TV was fun. - Look at me when I'm talking to you. - I can hear you. - I said, look at me. - Some of the veteran actors had more difficulty, especially somebody like Joan Bennett, who had come from film where they do take after take and a studio system. - She was wonderful on this show, but she was terrified. She had beautiful green eyes that kind of-- I could see just panic, just absolute panic. - You've never had a stranger living here, Carolyn. Perhaps it was a mistake. - We would meet at the bar at the end of the day and get soused and take off. And there wasn't a lot of socializing out of the thing, but while we were performing, while we were working, it was really cool. We really liked each other. - We were like a family, like a little repertory company. And we never felt, I don't think, that we were doing a soap opera. I never thought of it as that. I always thought of it as sort of a wonderful anthology series. - I know people now say, wow, we were doing something really groundbreaking. I never really thought that. I was so happy to have a job that I just kind of learned my words and went every day as prepared as I could be. - Despite the dedication of its cast and crew, "Dark Shadows" initially struggled to find an audience. - When the show went on the air, nobody was watching. And as we got past the first 13 weeks, I knew we were going to be history, we weren't going to make it. - Nobody paid any attention to it. It got bad ratings-- well, hardly any. - The way in which you achieved ratings on these shows was to see to it that the audience that you had, instead of watching 1 1/2 times a week, or twice a week, watched 2 1/2 times a week. That tied very much into the way in which you had to plot these shows. - Sorry, I was just getting a cup of coffee. - My name's Devlin. - What? Why, Burke, it's nice to see you. - Burke Devlin. I wired for three rooms. - We weren't moving the plot fast enough. It had to move faster. He was always trying to energize the process of the unfolding of the show. His instincts weren't always wrong, but with regard to how a soap opera works, it wasn't the best. - Roger, who else knows about this? - What difference does it make? - I want to know. - The show wasn't doing well. And it was really kind of dying. - He said to me, "Tell me the truth. You're going to have to cancel me, aren't you?" I said, "Yeah, their numbers are not really good." - And he called the guy at ABC, he said, "Look, give me just 13 more weeks. That's all I'm asking. Let me just see if I can salvage this thing." He said, "Then let me take the lid off." I said, "What do you mean by that, Dan?" He said, "Let me really push the envelope." And he came in one morning and he said one of his daughters-- I don't remember which one-- said to him-- he was complaining. It wasn't working out for him. - Me and my sister, we were the perfect age for "Dark Shadows," and we were very into it. And one day, he was asking us about it. And the way he always told the story, he always mimicked us. He said, my daughters said, daddy, make it scarier. - And he came in that next morning and he said, we're going to do ghosts and ghouls. - Did you see the ghost? - David, I've told you there are no such things as ghosts - Yes, there are. I've seen them. - Where? - Here at Collinwood. They like it best at night. - I figured, why the hell not? Let's make it really scary. What have I got to lose? I'm going off the air. No one's ever done anything like this. I'll let it rip. - And I had said to Dan, "Once you go supernatural, you can't go back. This is it." - I was on the show the very first day when our director, Lela Swift, read the script and said, "Oh... Oh! We're doing a ghost story." - Again, when you are in a little bit of a survival mode, you were more willing to take chances. ABC was an innovative network, largely because it was typically a last place network, and the history of TV is always the last place network is going to be the most innovative network. But you know there was a real emphasis on going for a real vision there, that they needed to do something different. - Dan Curtis said to me, "So what do you think you can do?" There was the character of Laura, who was in an institution in Phoenix, Arizona. And she was getting out of the institution, and she wanted to come to Collinwood. - I had a feeling about you, a feeling that it's not good for you to be in this house, that you might be happier and safer away from Collinwood. - I said, "She is a Phoenix, a mythological creature who every 100 years goes into the fire and is reborn. And that's what she wants to do with her son, take him back, they'll go into the fire together, and they'll be reborn together for another 100 years." - He's going to be reborn, just as I've been reborn century after century. - Dan and his vice president are looking at me and I'm saying, "Oh, my god, I blew it." And Dan said, "Well, you think you can do it?" I said, "Look, you're only on the air for four more weeks. What have you got to lose?" - The Phoenix is reborn! - As soon as it hit the air, the ratings started going up and a couple of sponsors started buying in. Four weeks was all it was supposed to last. With all the increases, ABC decided to renew for another 13 weeks. Dan Curtis and I were talking. And he said, "What do we do now?" "Let's do something continually in the supernatural." So he said, "How about a vampire?" I said, "That's it!" - I am Dracula. - Historically, horror literature and popular entertainment have portrayed the vampire as a cold, bloodthirsty monster, typified most famously by Bram Stoker's "Dracula." Numerous movies had exploited such a character to chilling effect, but "Dark Shadows" was about to shatter the mold with its daring approach to the undead menace. - Yes? - Let's pretend we are the first people doing a vampire series anything. We make our own ground rules. They never heard of Bela Lugosi, the people in this town. They never saw "Dracula." They never read it. They knew nothing about it. He can't turn into a wolf. He is a relatively human-seeming body who thrives on blood. - We were going to make him a reluctant vampire. And all of a sudden, the emotional possibilities of playing on that, that he really did not want to do this to people, he didn't want to be who he was. - Don't cast a guy who looks like Bela Lugosi. Get some guy who-- young, blonde guy, not an old vampire. But get a young blonde guy, and we'll play it from there. - Canadian stage actor Jonathan Frid was cast as the vampire Barnabas Collins. He arrived at Collinwood in the spring of 1967. - Oh, Madam. If you would, you may tell her that it's Barnabas Collins. - Jonathan Frid was on his away to California and the phone rang. He was halfway out the door-- true story-- turned around, picked up the phone, got the job as Barnabas Collins. - There's been a drastic change in my life. I am no longer really human. - I remember going to the office and seeing all these cadavers sitting around that were also up at the last for the part. And when I realized that I had out-cadavered them all, it wasn't exactly too heartening. But anyway, the actual person who cast me was Ron Sproat, who was one of the writers, and he'd been a playwright at Yale while I was there as a directing major. - Ron and I one time, we were in a saloon in the village and there was Jon. And Jon said, "Oh, I'm going to be on that show. I'm going to play the vampire." And we though, "Oh shit." - Of course, they hired Jonathan Frid, who when I looked at him I wanted to faint. I mean, they had hired Bela Lugosi. And I knew he was scared stiff. Suddenly he's the star of a soap opera. - What is true, father? What? - So I said, "Jonathan, you're a nice guy. Be a nice guy with everybody and all the characters. Make them like you. They're your family. So just play it easy. Relax it. And don't go overboard." And that's what he did. - And of course, he turned out to be perfect. - I was a very nervous actor. I think what made the part work for me is that Barnabas also was a very nervous character. If you accept the premise, he comes out of his coffin, having been in it for 150 years or whatever, and he comes out into this new world and has to tell a lie instantly, that he was the great grandson of this portrait, when in fact he's the same guy. - Forgive me for staring, but for the moment it seems as though I've seen a-- - Ghost? - Well, the likeness is remarkable! - So he was a very nervous person, and as he adjusted and got his act together, so I as an actor got adjusted to television. So the two of us kind of went along together. And that's probably why people maybe identified me as the vampire. - He chose to play him not like a monster, but like a romantic hero who has been cursed, who has been given this death sentence to have to be someone who drinks blood to stay alive. - I am free now and alive. The chains with which she bound me are broken, and I've returned to live the life I never had... Whatever that may turn out to be. - Everything about him, unlike any vampire that's ever been written, was so human. And people could attach themselves to it. They could say, oh, I know that feeling. I've had that feeling. - The depth of his guilt and the anguish that he experienced as a result of what he was cursed to be and what he had become-- that's what he chose to play, rather than the fiend who climbs through the window and has the teeth hanging out and the long fingernails. - I feel your presence. Show yourself! - He was a tragic hero. He'd messed around with the wrong woman and she fixed him forever. - I set a curse on you, Barnabas Collins. - She kept saying, I'll take away the curse if you'll love me. But he wouldn't do it. - I could not love you. - Perhaps this time you will learn to love me. - Think about that. I mean, here's this enduring, iconic archetype of international horror who's represented one way for all these years. And then Dan Curtis and Jonathan Frid basically came along and changed that. That was hugely significant from a cultural perspective. - Oh, it was completely new. There had never been anything like this on television. - I think it was the excitement about that. And certainly for teenagers, it was like a new discovery, an entry into adult sexuality, but a very odd adult sexuality. - It really was about compulsive sex. "I've got to have it or I'll die." Well, literally for Barnabas, that was true. "I've got to have it or I'll die." And especially teenagers, they're going to die if they don't have it. - It's a sexual metaphor. So everybody who got bit always grabbed their partner and-- like it was very pleasurable. - Dan was so worried about homoeroticism or anything like that, so that when Barnabas bites somebody, women got bit on the neck and man got bit on the wrist. - Your arm looks strange. - We had a representative that sat in the green room, and if she saw any blood at all, she'd go back and she'd say, "I'm sorry, we can't have any blood," because, you know, Ivory Snow or Ponds was our sponsor and she was afraid that people would turn off because it was so scary. - And it became apparent very early on that we were onto something. - It came on at 4 o'clock in the afternoon, just in time for the kids to be home from school. And they got a horror show at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Unheard of. Not some stupid, silly little drama of two people kissing. This was the real McCoy, bloodsucking and stuff. - Vampires and Gothic stuff... I'm 8 or 9 or 10, and it was just right up my alley because that's the stuff I loved. - I don't know how we knew that there was going to be this show about vampires, but we did. And I remember it came on late in the afternoon so that if we jumped off the bus, school bus home, and ran inside one of our houses, we'd get there right when it started. - I was a very, very young teenager at that point. I would never run home from school to watch a soap opera. Never. Would never have occurred to me or my friends-- I mean, particularly male friends. And all of a sudden, we had to get home at 4:00 or 4:30, whenever it was, because we had to see Barnabas on "Dark Shadows." - Anybody I meet and say I worked on "Dark Shadows," they say, "Oh, I used to run home from school. I'd get home at 4 o'clock to see it." Everybody. - There was something about it that just attracted us. It was exciting. It was out of the ordinary. It was unusual. - It wasn't your mom's Gothic romance. It was your Gothic romance. These were characters that were talking to you. - That I should come to this century, find you so like Josette. - Initially, Barnabas was only intended to be on the show for 13 weeks. Dan had planned to kill him off while young viewers were home watching on summer vacation. - He'd been there a couple of weeks and Dan Curtis is coming down the hallway, holding what looked like some perhaps legal papers. And Jonathan thought, I'm getting sacked. This is the notice. And Dan said, "Here, these are for you, Jonathan." And he said, "What?" He said, "They're fan letters." And Jonathan said, "Fan letters for me?" And that was the beginning of weeks and weeks of thousands of letters started to come in. And he was stunned that all these people were watching the show and loving what he was doing. - I remember going out the front door of the studio, and there were some school kids there. We signed a few autographs and chatted and whatnot. A week later, it was double the size and then quadruple the size. And suddenly we had a whole street full of kids who had come to the studio after school to see us. - You'd sign enough autographs to get through the crowd and hopefully make it up to the corner so you could get a cab and get out of there. - They were wild. They were wonderful. I had them stealing and getting in the back of my truck and I didn't know it and I'd get home and they found out where I lived. Oh, man. That was insane. - People don't usually talk about this. It was very popular with prostitutes and drug addicts because they were just waking up-- 4 o'clock, watching our show. So I'd be walking down 48th Street and the hookers would be out there, "Jeb! Hey, Jeb!" - We had to hire a company to handle all the fan mail. It was unbelievable. At the beginning, we would get it and read it and we'd love reading the fan mail. Well, the fan mail got to be so gigantic that you couldn't read it. I mean, the company had to answer letters. It was just-- it got to be insane. - "16 Magazine..." I was on the cover of "16 Magazine" and "Tiger Beat" magazine. - And I also used to get "16 Magazine." And so "16 Magazine" always had the cast. And Jonathan Frid's picture was on my wall because I wanted to get bit. - The articles that we wrote were generated by the mail that we got from the readers. And it was very interesting because all of a sudden we started getting some random letters and they were asking about who played Barnabas Collins on "Dark Shadows." And when we did take a look at the show, we saw that he played a vampire, which is a very romantic figure to a lot of young girls. But it was very unusual, because we didn't get mail about soap opera people, even young people on soap operas. We also featured a lot of things about the storyline of the show, which was very unusual because you didn't usually write about what an episode of "The Brady Bunch" was about or "The Partridge Family." You wrote about what David Cassidy liked to eat for breakfast. But it was very different with "Dark Shadows." It was a whole show that had an appeal. Definitely more dangerous, more edgy than a lot of the other things that we would write about. The creator of "Dark Shadows," Dan Curtis, was quite astute because he understood the power of having an inroad to this audience. - "You can never tell what in the dark shadows or what lurks behind each door. But with groovy horror heads for friends, you won't be scared anymore!" - You may notice some fog drifting in from backstage here. You'll understand why when you see the gentleman who needs no introduction to the younger generation. Watch. - What is your blood type? - I think it's O. Back to the hearse. - He did a lot of appearances, sometimes in very small towns across the country. And they wouldn't be prepared for the thousands of fans who would appear. And in fact, in his neighborhood, he was being stalked at the grocery store and he was having to run in and out and discovered it was going to be too difficult to stay in his apartment, and he ended up leaving that apartment and moving into a apartment that had a doorman. - This show has really caught on. I know in my house, my son runs home after school. We can't pull him away from the set. - And this, of course, is the star of it. Here's Jonathan Frid. - I may lose interest in what you're saying. This lovely neck right here. - I know. I know. We hear, in that part of television, that soap opera is... I mean, tedious work. It has to be. You have to learn a new script every day, don't you? - Yes. Oh, yes, it's tedious in that sense. - Sometimes he would be on every day. He was exhausted come the weekend, and yet they often had appearances for him to go on on the weekend. So it was a very draining schedule for him. - He actually had dyslexia, which he only realized around that time. So the fact that he had to overnight learn lines was always challenging and would keep him up late at night. - Tomorrow evening will be an occasion long remembered. That night must go nothing wrong. - Sweetheart of sweethearts. Couldn't remember a line, but was a great guy. He was always looking for the lines somewhere. I would whisper a line to him, even on camera. - I am defending the right of this girl to be judged innocent until she is proved innocent. - After the show we'd go to this bar a couple of blocks away and he'd have about five or six vodkas and... He was a great dude, Jonny. He was a sweetheart, just a sweetheart. - He was definitely an actor who was critical of his performance. And he would sometimes go home at the end of the day thinking, oh, I wish I could have done that better. But there was a part of him that said, well, I get another chance tomorrow, there's another show tomorrow. And he didn't ever think the show would be rerun. He said, "It'll be aired once. It won't be seen again. All right, I'll get the opportunity to do another show." Little did he know that the show would go on and on and on. - It's hard to describe the success of that show, isn't it, Jonathan? - Yes, I must say it is. - What is the audience's fascination with the morbid? - I've really never been able to figure it out but I'm enjoying it immensely. But I've never been able to figure it out. - I get asked a lot, as if I'm somehow an expert on this, what is it about vampires that's attractive to people or women or youngsters? Ultimately, I think they're not dying thing. That's really attractive. I thought about it. And I thought, maybe it's a safe way to have a sort of fantasy of being taken. - I know what you are. - He presented that idea that you could be part of this Gothic love. "Is it you?" It was kind of wonderful because he'd bite somebody, and he tried really hard to look rough while he was biting but he didn't. He didn't look like he was going like rip your throat out. It was like, "Oh, yeah, I want you to bite me." - Jonathan, I'd be curious to know what your mail is like on that show? What do people write to you about? - Well, it gets rather exotic at times, I must say. - Is it sick mail or very appreciative? Do you recall any particular piece of mail that-- - Well, I think most of the mail that I find it amusing is the kind of mail from people who really get involved in the story, and they cannot imagine you as anybody else but the character you're playing. And even on tours I've been on, people come up to me and they really believe I'm a vampire. - Jonathan used to get tons of big bags of mail from women, pictures of themselves. It was crazy. They used to send him these pictures of-- nude pictures of themselves, all kinds of very sick stuff was going on. - You're going to die, Miss Trask? Do you realize that? - I will be with him. - It was really an incredible success. It could not have been anticipated in any way, and that when it did happen everybody reveled in it and worked hard. - We were a soap opera. And it was just phenomenal to have that kind of response. - It was way out in left field. It was revolutionary. - It changed the entire face of daytime television. - Committed to continuing the success of "Dark Shadows," ABC built a studio for the show at West 53rd Street, New York City. - I got a pretty good imagination. And I reached the point where I didn't know what I was going to do next. What kind of a story could I come up with and keep this guy going? - What's happening? - We're trapped! We're trapped in another time! - I was always fascinated by time travel. And I thought, "Well, wait a minute! Why don't we go back into the past and find out how Barnabas became a vampire?" - Your soul will never rest, Barnabas. - Wow, you talk about success. It was our most popular story. I never wanted to get out of the past. I stayed there forever. And the thing that was so wonderful about it is when Victoria was transported back through a seance-- that was my device-- and she walks into Collinwood-- or the old house, the way it was in those days-- and there are all the same actors playing different roles. The audience went nuts over that. They just loved that. - Why doesn't anybody know me? - Good evening. I'm Mrs. Collins. You must be the new governess. - The network executives told Dan this was not going to work, he needed to hire a different actress. And he said, "No, no." He said, "No, the audience will follow us. I trust them." And they did. - The biggest problem for me on "Dark Shadows" was to constantly come up with stories. And I thought, wouldn't it to be great if I could bring in another character that was equally as popular as Barnabas so that every story didn't have to be tied to the vampire? Which was the problem with the show. Because if you didn't have the vampire operating as a vampire, the audience wasn't very happy. So it was a true challenge to try and find something else that really worked. - Hi, Quentin. - They said, come over to the studio the next day. So I did. And all they did was look at me on camera and that was it. And then that's when they told me that I wasn't going to speak for the first few shows. - Aren't you going to say something, Quentin? - Did you imagine doing a show with ghosts and vampires? No. Nor did I ever imagine in the world that I would be playing a werewolf. I can't... - I love a werewolf. And I just think, sometimes you just have to take people as they are. You just have to accept them. I would have taken that bite also. Just saying. - Somebody mentioned to me that there was going to be a song, a theme song. And every time the character appeared, there would be this music. - It's such pretty music, isn't it, David? - Once again, I got a call from Dan. "Cobert, you've got to come down. I got a new spook. I got a new spook coming on the show. His name is Quentin. And he first appears out of an old phonograph. And we hear this music, which will be Quentin's theme." And then he said, "Well, how long is this going to take you?" And I said, "Would you like to hear it in about 30 seconds or so?" And he looked at me. He said, "Come on, Cobe. What are you, kidding me?" I said, "No." [singing quentin's theme] He said, "Oh, my God! I love it! That's gorgeous! That's fantastic." He said, "It sounds familiar." I said, "Yeah, it should sound familiar. I wrote it for Billie Whitelaw in our 'Jekyll and Hyde.'" - Hey. Did your friend warn you? - Jekyll? He isn't here tonight. I looked. - Well, he's brought some reinforcements. - That music... - It's his! - I called my dad. And I said, "Dad, I got my theme song! I've got a theme song." And then they wrote words for it, "Shadows of the Night." - Shadows of the night, calling me to you. - Biggest hit song to ever come out of daytime television, possibly the only hit song to ever come out of daytime television. One of the few major hits to come out of any kind of television. And the LP that came out featuring Quentin's theme was the second highest selling LP from television of all times. - And I know that Quentin's theme was recorded by several people. There were a lot of different orchestrations of it. I guess it did fine. - Sold lots of records. Come on, made a lot of money. Let's not be shy about this. - It was a respite to go to the studio because of what was going on around us with the Vietnam War, with the Kennedy assassination, the Martin Luther King assassination, with the political situation. It was a difficult time. - "By 1967, more than 100 Americans were dying each week in Vietnam." - It was a way to in many ways escape the pressures of America, especially for teenagers. Teenagers obviously had older siblings who were involved in either the war effort or the anti-war effort. There was a great division in almost every family. And I think the kids especially who really were getting a little tired of this continuing debate in the family, where you politically stand, this was a way to sort of see the world anew, but it also sort of brought you back into the world, too, the idea of the world seemed possessed. There seemed to be demons loose in America in the late '60s. But here, it was a way to look at a world possessed but maybe not as anxiety feeling as the real world was. - We would go inside this studio and create this other world. And I think to a certain extent, people loved that other world. - Harry and I went to Europe every year. Mainly, we would go to London first or London at the end. They had wonderful secondhand bookshops. And I used to bring a lot of stuff back to the office. Gave them a lot of horror material. - Horror is a very rich source to steal from. - "Dark Shadows" was not shy about borrowing plots from other places. - "The Turn of the Screw," "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde," "Dracula," of course, the Frankenstein story, "Jane Eyre," "Wuthering Heights." - There was one thing that we missed, I think, and that was mummies. But other than that, we hit them all. - I have the witch! - At one point, some viewer wrote to Dan and he said, "You don't have a staff of writers, you've got a den of thieves." - He used to say, this is not-- "Dark Shadows" is not horror. "Dark Shadows" is Gothic romance. - No. This is insane. - I used to read the scripts, obviously, ahead of time when we got them. And I would scratch my head on certain things and go, I have no idea how we're going to pull this off. - With five half hour slots a week to fill, producing a steady flow of surprises was an arduous task for Dan and his writers. - Ron Sproat used to have very long sessions with Dan Curtis about plotting the show. They were legendary. - We actually had 24 hour story sessions. And we'd leave the place at 9 AM-- went in at 9 AM, came out at 9 AM the next morning. Of course, we wanted to get a couple of weeks work laid out so we can go and write them instead of meeting every week. - The sessions with Dan could be grueling. He would putt golf balls. He even had a wall to wall green carpet. And so he would just constantly putt that ball back and forth and then he would talk and while he was doing it. - I've seen writers come out of interviews with him with their knees shaking. He scares them to death. He had those penetrating eyes. He would say, "All right, send in this asshole." He said, "Send him in." And so they'd send him in. "Tell this asshole that if he doesn't drop this idea of wanting more money, I am going to go out of my office and go down the corridor and get in the elevator and go down to the first floor and walk across the street to his office and tear his fucking face off." If you gave him anything less than your best, he did not appreciate that and would not use you again. - He was an artist and a real artist because he kept saying, how can we make it better? What can we do to make it better? How can we-- to keep challenging himself and to challenge us. - You start trying to plot and you think the most stupid things. And I remember Dan Curtis literally falling out of his chair and rolling on the floor. It was a good time. - One of the reasons I liked writing for "Dark Shadows" is that I could be shameless and could just do shameless things that you couldn't do any place else. You could really stick it to 'em. - Make them my servants... Now! - While the writers scoured all corners of Gothic and supernatural lore to maintain the show's rapid pace, in turn the special effects crew were on call more frequently than one would expect on a daytime drama. - Kitty? - Back in 1966, special effects were very primitive. One of our special effects was a paper bat hanging on a fish line and a prop man jiggled a fishing pole. That was our scary bat. - I remember when my head was chopped off and it rolled across the floor as this one character, and it was so funny. And I just couldn't stop laughing. And nobody could stop laughing. And Dan finally said, cut, cut-- which he rarely cut. Rarely cut. You had to do something like this for him to cut. And he goes, "Hey, Rog, don't break up, OK?" - Please. - I ordered you to go. Now! - I mean, the hand coming out of the grave was literally a prop guy lying on his back underneath. I remember my favorite note was, "Kathryn, when you see the hand coming out of the grave, turn to camera three and scream." - The vampire would say, "Come to me for comfort. I need you." And then the other person would go... While they were doing that, you're putting in your teeth, which were fitted. They were made by the dentist. They are fitted right on our own eye teeth. And then the camera would come back to you and you'd go-- It turned out a little campy because when you have a ghost coming out of his grave and he's covered with blood and bandages and... you just can't help but think it's funny. But on the other hand, we played it entirely as though it were really, really happening. - You must learn what it is to live in the land of the dead. - I'm really amazed that the shows came on that well. I mean, we're known for our bloopers, I know, for the shaky scenery and all of that sort of thing. - I 'spect you're wondering what I'm doing here, eh? - No, I'm glad you're here. - Frankly, considering the circumstances we were working under, starting at 8:00 in the morning and doing our show live at 3:30? Pretty amazing. - Tell them that you saw no one here. - Oh, that's fine. What am I going to tell them? - That you saw no one here! - The mistakes that you were making, because of the limited budget a lot of times you weren't going back and reshooting it. The most famous one from "Dark Shadows" is there's a credit crawl at the end of one episode where you actually see Jonathan Frid, who played Barnabas, walking across the screen holding his shoes. - It's just like being in summer stock and doing a play. Things went wrong, the boom would come into the shot, or the prop man would be running across and back. Or I'd walk through the graveyard and the gravestones were all Styrofoam so I'd knock them over with my dress. - The camera bumping over a cable, so the shot kind of goes up and down. - Several of my incestors-- incestors-- my ancestors are buried here. - After one of those shows, you'd go to your dressing room and burst into tears and then beg for another chance, just this once can we redo it? And Dan would say, "No! Why? He said, "This is going to be seen once by a bunch of housewives. Who cares?" - You know what to do, Vicki-- you know what to do now, Julia. - It was like a repertory company. - Seems to me that-- - I would advise you not to make a move. - But Dan was... He was a force. - The actors adored him. They loved his direction. They loved the way he treated them. - He was always on my side. And I really was incredibly indebted to him. - I got along with him just fine because he loved my sense of humor and I loved his and we'd make each other laugh a lot. - If you were in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in a leaky rowboat with one oar, you would want Dan Curtis in that boat with you because he would figure out a way to save your neck and get you to shore. - By this point, Dan Curtis had set his sights beyond television and was poised to make a leap into movies. The choice of his first feature was obvious-- a spin-off of "Dark Shadows." - I command you to come to me! - "Barnabas Collins, vampire, takes a bride in a bizarre act of unnatural love. Come and see how the vampires do it." - When Dan prepared "House of Dark Shadows," he took the basic premise of the series but he went to a more traditional vampire, a vampire who was really evil and deserved to get a stake in his heart at the end. - They weren't making Barnabas a reluctant vampire. And I mentioned that to Dan. I said, "You're not making him vulnerable. You're not making him reluctant." And he looked at me in a very-- he said, "No, we're not doing it that way this time." - "'House of Dark Shadows.' Where death is a way of life." - And we got to do another take. And they stopped and they relit you so that you were doing a close up with different lighting. My goodness, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. - He loved directing. He was just a kid in a candy shop. He was having a wonderful time. - "House of Dark Shadows" was an unexpected hit for MGM. The studio green lit a sequel almost immediately. However, this did not sit well with everyone. Jonathan was ultimately disappointed when he saw the movie because it had so much more the blood, the gore. So he was disappointed and told Dan he didn't want to do the second movie. And Dan wasn't happy about that. - And he said, "I don't think playing a vampire is good for my image. A number of my friends have said to me they don't think this is good for my career." And I can still remember saying to him, "What about the image of an out of work actor? Is that better?" - I believe that there was a wedge that came between them because he obviously had to create a whole new script. - "Come back to Collinwood, that house of dark shadows, where life and death go on as usual. 'Night of Dark Shadows.'" - "Night of Dark Shadows" proved less successful at the box office. - After the movie, I didn't know what else I was going to do. I couldn't think of another idea. But then we started getting into things like the Leviathan and stuff like that. I was becoming very disenchanted right along with the audience. I was just hoping it was going to end. I just wanted to move on. I couldn't squeeze my brain any harder to come up with one more story. - Come to me. Come to me. We shall share eternity. - As the show got more complicated, I think that we may have started losing a few audience members then. - We weren't working with Dan anymore. And we weren't that good. We weren't. As I mentioned before, we needed Dan. And without him there riding herd, the show suffered. - Dan used to say, when asked why did you stop "Dark Shadows"? And he goes, "Simple. We ran out of things for Barnabas to bite." - So I was out in the middle of a wardrobe fitting and I got the news that, don't bother, they've canceled the show. - "And for as long as they lived, the dark shadows at Collinwood were but a memory of a distant past." - Collinwood quietly shuttered its doors on April 2, 1971. - But the irony of this whole thing, that "Dark Shadows" is actually one of the shortest lived soap operas ever. But then, of course, one good reason for that is because it dealt with specific material and we ran out of material. I mean, there are only about a dozen classic horror stories and we did them once and twice over. - "Dark Shadows" is not that much different from most hot things in American culture, whether it's music, film, or television. There's an intensity. But then, obviously, teenagers age. They go to college. And you had that great period of teenagers, 14 to 18, but they will mature and they will go on to something else. - Then we just went on with our lives. I mean, I was very young. I went to California to become a movie star, not realizing that the best role I would ever get would be Angelique. - Though Jonathan Frid continued to work, the roles he was offered were not always to his liking. - He actually got a new agent right towards the end of "Dark Shadows" and they immediately said we're going to send you out to all these different projects. And they were horror movies. He did the "Devil's Daughter." and then he did Oliver Stone's directorial debut, "Seizure." - "You can never hide from it. The breath-stopping panic of 'Seizure.'" - He had found Barnabas a multifaceted character and yet casting people were saying, "Oh, do your thing, Mr. Frid! He said, "What thing? I didn't have a vampire thing. I was an actor playing a very varied character." There was definitely frustration. So he decided to take a break from acting. - Meanwhile, Curtis encountered a similar frustration, finding that the majority of projects he was able to get off the ground returned into the realm of horror. - What's kind of interesting to me about Dan Curtis post "Dark Shadows" is that if you think about that period in the '70s, I think Dan Curtis pretty much defined television horror in that period, when he did those classic adaptations with Frankenstein and Dracula. - "A terrifying love story that reaches back into the dead past." - And then "Night Stalker" and the two films. Particularly the first one, I think, were very successful from a ratings perspective. I mean, "Trilogy of Terror" is another thing with an incredible shelf-life. - He felt that he was trapped in the genre, as a matter of fact. He said, "You can't get out. If you do well, the better you do, the more they want you to do more of the same kind of thing. And I'm tired of doing that stuff," he said. "I've scared enough people." - "In this old house, something lives. Something strange. Something evil. 'Burnt Offerings.'" - I think that he had wanted to move on and he had been there, done that successfully. He was ready to try something new. - Something shifted, I think, inside of him where he really wanted to do things with more meaning. - Dan convinced writer Herman Wouk to sell the rights to his epic novel, "The Winds of War." So began a colossal three year production in six countries with a cast of thousands. - Dan started out by saying, "The book is the Bible of the mini series. We're going to follow the book. And when in doubt, we go to the book." This is what he said to me. In attempting to write for television, I did some ad libbing. And he said, "No, go back to the book." That was the first thing I learned from him, which is-- it was music to my ears. - And we started working on this show, which was so devouring and so intense. We were like rabid wolves. I think we had around 300 speaking parts in "Winds of War" and 2,000 extra parts and 3,000 extras all in costume. Dan loved difficult and very challenging kind of nerve-wracking situations. It was his perilous sense of drama. We were insane. We shot six day weeks. Six day weeks and we were looking at dailies at midnight. And then you get up at 5:00 AM to go to the set. And then on Sunday, we're preparing for the next week. And I don't know how anybody survived. - And he said, "You feel like God." He said, "Here, let's do Pearl Harbor next week." He said, "Turn the battleship around." "Well, Mr. Curtis, it takes an hour and a half to turn the battleship around." "I want it facing the other direction. It should be facing that direction." They said, "No, no, no, sir. We better shoot it facing this direction. It'll-- "Turn the battleship around!" - So he was king of the castle, king of the circus. He was made to be some kind of-- some creature like Napoleon. "Onwards and upwards. We'll make it through this horror show. We'll do it. We'll win!" - Budgeted at $40 million, the "Winds of War" was a historic undertaking for television. And the Herculean effort paid off. The mini-series attracted an audience of over 140 million viewers in the U.S. alone and became a resounding success worldwide. - The "Winds of War" was a huge success. I mean, wild. It was the most dominant show of that era. - It was so successful. The amount of viewership and ABC was very excited. - It was the toughest thing I ever had to do, yet I never got tired. And it was the experience of my life. - I'm happy as a lark, believe me, as we go rolling, rolling home. - After "Winds of War," ABC asked him to do "War and Remembrance." It was quite an undertaking to do "Winds of War" and I know a huge decision on my father's part. And my mother saw that he wasn't that happy after doing that big project and not having something of that scope to do next. And so he decided to do it. The network said, "Well, why don't you hire a director to do each segment?" And he's like, "Are you kidding me? I'm going to do them all!" - And there we were in New York, starting to prep "War and Remembrance" in the Plaza Hotel. And Barry Diller calls up and said he's pulling the plug. And I remember, I got this insane sense of elation. I thought, "Thank God! Save me, God. Thank you. They're pulling the plug. I don't have to commit to this for another five years." And Dan, who was a brilliant salesman, spoke to Barry Diller for an hour and talked him out of it. - And so a further four years of epic television production in eight countries began. - It was the first time anybody had ever filmed in Auschwitz. And he got the approval. It was a very, very emotional time, too, because that was the first time ever that such graphic images were portrayed on TV of the Holocaust. - The Emmy goes to "War and Remembrance." Dan Curtis, executive producer, Barbara Steele, producer. - He won the Golden Globe award. He won an Emmy. He was honored by the Simon Wiesenthal Center with an award. - It took longer than World War II, I know. But I love actors. And these are the greatest actors. I love 'em! And what they did, they brought this thing to life and they made it happen. - The entire two together constituted 34 hours of television. And that will never happen again. They'll never have the financing for it. They'll never have a man who can do it. - Spook fans and all that will think that "Trilogy" was his masterpiece. "Dark Shadows" was certainly a masterpiece. But as a producer and everything else, "Winds" and "War" went way, way above. - Oh, I think this was the pinnacle of his existence. It wasn't just his creative existence. - Despite the enthusiastic critical reception, the viewership for "War and Remembrance" did not reach the record breaking heights of the "Winds of War." - "Bill," he said, "I can't get back to that level. I don't think I'll ever get back to that level again because they won't finance anything like that again. I'm really frustrated because I've done these things. I've gotten these great reviews from people. I've gotten notices for the first time in my life that I never thought I'd ever get." He said, "Marvelous appreciation." When he had to go back to the genre again and do horror films, it was a big letdown for him. - I had spent 10 years on the "Winds of War" and "War and Remembrance." I thought nothing would ever satisfy me again. Everything seemed so paltry to me. But all along, NBC had been coming to me, calling me in London at weird hours. They had the writers' strike. They wanted to do "Dark Shadows." And the last thing in the world I wanted to do was "Dark Shadows." I didn't want to go back into that world again. I'd just had it. So I said to them, "If you allow me to use the stories that I used before, that might be interesting because I could do it in a way that I always envisioned being able to do it but couldn't." - "Dark Shadows" was resurrected in 1991 with a 13 week commitment on NBC in primetime. Ben Cross assumed the mantle of Barnabas Collins. - I, frankly, have never seen one episode of the original series. I asked Dan. I said, "Please give me at least some of those episodes so I can look at them." And he said, "No, Ben. You don't need it. This is on another level." - And I think it was, to a certain degree, modernized in its approach. You couldn't certainly act the way they acted in the earlier ones, the early versions. It was very kind of stilted but it worked for that. It worked because it created a certain atmosphere. This kind of opened it up. And it was shot in color, of course, and shot on film. - And so it lent very heavily on Dan for the first, let's say, four or five episodes. So it was rather lovely. Each episode after that, I got to bite the necks of some rather beautiful Hollywood actresses. I mean, this isn't in any way-- I'm not demeaning women by judging them on their sexuality or not, but you cannot make a vampire show, film, series... It's all about sex. The undercurrent is all about sex. Dan Curtis didn't say, now, the undercurrent of all this is this. Of course not. But at the same time, there is this kind of wild aspect to it. He had forces inside him that at times he literally could not control. So at the moment of biting someone's neck, there is that feral, vicious, wild-- This sort of blood fest, this need for blood. But of course, it's a bit like getting drunk and making a fool of yourself the night before. There's this awful regret the next day when you think about, perhaps, what you've done. - Ben Cross was the vampire in our show. And I thought he was great because he looks like a medieval gargoyle. He had this drawn, very intense face. And I play his sort of adversary, this character Julia Hoffman, this doctor who's got this sort of secret in her potions on how to keep him alive. - We had people that were-- Jean Simmons, for example. I mean, iconic actress from the movies. And she was playing the matriarch of the family. Even Joseph Gordon Levitt was on that as a little boy. Little Joey, we used to call him. I mean, I worked as a director on the first two and then produced the other ones. I was given a lot of latitude because Dan was very, very generous. And I learned a lot from him, too. - No one on the set worked harder than him. Incredible stamina, incredible drive. If he didn't like something, boy, did you know it. If it was critical or it was this or it came from frustration. "Oh, god, I've got to get this right!" And that's the kind of man he is. - Dan was possessed and agitated. I think he was very reluctant to go back and do a "Dark Shadows" again. It was very painful. I actually quit in the middle of it. Bang in the middle. I couldn't stand the way he talked to me. He was so concerned about the framing of the syringe or something. I couldn't stand-- and I said, "I'm out of here. I quit. Five weeks into shooting. Recast me. Reshoot everything. I'm gone." And the crew applauded. Oh, the crew applauded! I've never felt so good. Then I made this wonderful exit. And then, of course, I came back the next day. - The end result, I thought, pictorially was wonderful. - I think people were eager to see this again. I mean, the people who were familiar with it certainly tuned in. And those who were unfamiliar with it were intrigued. So you had an audience. Unfortunately, what also happened historically at that time was the Gulf War. - The first Gulf War occurred at that time. And it being the age that we are in-- were in at that time-- this was like a live feed from the battlefront. And it was on all the major channels. And so the series, in a sense, was bumped. There was no room for that kind of thing at that moment. The ratings were not there for NBC and we heard that NBC's not going to renew. - I'm not only not ashamed that I did that series, I actually consider myself very lucky and blessed to be given the opportunity. - While a return to Collinwood was struggling to take hold, appreciation for the original series continued to grow. "Dark Shadows" inspired fan conventions that achieved rabid popularity. And the cast embraced the burgeoning fandom as the original series episodes were released on home video and re-run on television. - He returned in 2006 and then through 2011. And now in his 80s, he wasn't in the best physical shape. Why did he come back? I mean, an actor is always an actor. He loved the fans. And he really, I think, had a desire to see the fans again, to one more time glory, to be there and tell them stories. And so he got himself back. And he loved being there again. - Bravo! - Physically, towards the end, it was hard, but he made the effort to be there, to see them again and perform for them again. - I'm not suggesting, I'm telling you: don't kick ass. Better that than to kiss it. - Jonathan Frid passed away in 2012. His final role was a cameo that year in Tim Burton's reimagining of "Dark Shadows," with Johnny Depp assuming the role of Barnabas. - I will say there was a time when I just wished "Dark Shadows" would go away, just shoo, go somewhere else. However, since then my feelings about the show and about the people who watched the show have grown exponentially. - I am so proud of the fact that we are celebrating our 50th anniversary. It's very special to me. I love all of the people that are coming to help us celebrate. - It's mind-boggling. I mean, there are people in that audience who are grandchildren. It's amazing. I mean, people say, oh, God, you do "Dark Shadows"? They kind of put it down and that-- I'm kind of proud that we had the opportunity to do what we did. - And I asked some people yesterday when I was signing autographs, "Why do you come to this gathering?" And they said, "Well, we grew up with you." - And it became a big part of their childhood and that's one of the reasons for the longevity of the show. Because as we all had something we liked when we were kids, we still remember it. And for them, for that generation, it was "Dark Shadows." - And I think the people who find it think it's their show and they love it and they make their kids watch it, and then their kids love it. - If you look at "Dark Shadows" now and you realize that it was about characters that were outsiders who were trying to find their way in the world as it exists and get people to understand. - It's when the others became popular for a while. The eccentrics. You got to admit, we had a load of eccentrics. And you know what was good about them? The actors were just as eccentric as the characters they played. - We've known each other for 50 years. And it's just been a real joy to know them-- - Knock if off. - And to deal with him. He hasn't changed. I knew him 50 years ago, and he's still the schmuck that I knew 50 years ago. - It's a treat to see how people's lives progress. And it's seldom, I think, in life that unless people are relatives, you actually get that chance to see what's happened to people after 50 years. - Shadows of the night, calling me to you. I've never had a moment where I wasn't grateful for doing the show. It meant so much. And a lot of it was because of the people. - He gave us all our start so we'll forever be grateful to him. And he was the one who okayed my writing the books. So he's a powerful figure in my life. I wish he were still around. - Dan Curtis was flattered by the adulation for "Dark Shadows" but was not one to simply dwell on the past. He continued working on new projects until his final days. - His work ethic never diminished. His love and creativity never waned his entire life up until the final days. He was directing-- I think he had just finished "Our Fathers" very close to when he got sick. - And my father was losing his strength. But he had such a drive. And he used to tell me, "The only reason I work out as hard as I do is so that I can outlive your mother." - Dan passed away on March 27, 2006, less than three weeks after his wife Norma. - It feels very strange to be the creator of "Dark Shadows," because everywhere I go, when I hear "Dark Shadows" or they say, are you the guy who did "Dark Shadows"? And they all have the exact same line-- "I used to run home every day from school to see 'Dark Shadows.'" I always said, I'll probably be remembered for "Dark Shadows" and not the things that I really cared about, which were the great epics that I made. "Dark Shadows" will be the thing that will be on my gravestone. But I love "Dark Shadows." I guess it's terrific to have somehow created something that will live forever. It's not like brain surgery, but it's... Hopefully, it will live forever. [music playing]
