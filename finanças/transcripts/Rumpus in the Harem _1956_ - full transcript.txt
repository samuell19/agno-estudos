[♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [SNORING, WHISTLING] [SOBBING] Moe! Shemp! Larry! ALL: Wake up! We've got to see you. Okay, girls, we'll be with you in a jiffy. Larry, get up. Shemp, wake up. Our sweethearts are here. Listen, Larry. We-- [SNORING] Oh, yeah. Man the lifeboats. Me and the women first. [SNORING] Come on. Get up, get up. Hey, breakfast. Where? Come on, our girls are here. Rise and shine. Boy, it's only 10:00 in the morning. I wonder what they're doing here so early. Maybe it's because we're so irresistible. Oh, yeah. That could be. Oh! Why you... Hurry up! Let us in! All right, I'm coming. Oh, we have to talk to you. We're in trouble. [ALL CRYING] Take it easy, girls. I'll call Shemp. Shemp, get up. Sheba, Reba and Heba are here. Come on. What's this? "You guys snore so loud I couldn't sleep, "so I've gone down to open the restaurant. Will see you later. "P.S. If you don't get this note let me know "and I'll write you another. Signed, Shemp." How do you like that dummy? Our guardian is going to sell us to the Sultan of Pishpash. Oh! Unless we each pay him 1000 shilbleenas of virgin tax. Within three days. ALL: And we don't have the money. [ALL SOBBING] Oh, gosh. Gee, girls, we don't have the money either. After all, we're only poor owners of a small restaurant. ALL: Oh, woe is us! Girls, girls, girls. Please. Please, don't worry. We have three days. We'll get the money. We hope. Yeah. If worse comes to worse we can rob a bank. He's being working around thieves so much he's beginning to think like one. Now, girls. Don't worry, we'll find a way out. Cheer up. But what if you don't? [ALL SOBBING] Girls, girls. Have faith. In him. Sure, smile. Ring out those handkerchiefs and blow your nose. Boy, you're really weepy. Service! Come on. I need service. [WAITERS CLAMORING] Yes, sir. We have all the service. At your service. Phew! Boy, if I hadn't ducked we would've collided sure. What a narrow escape. [GASPS] SHEMP: What-- MOE: What's the matter with you? We'll have you all fixed up in a minute. What's this? Oh, happy birthday. [CHUCKLES] I would leave it on. People don't know if you're coming or going with this on. There you are, sir. You look very pretty and the spaghetti is as good as new. Why you... Moe! Dog of dogs, how dare you? A thousand pardons. It was unavoidable. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This will degrade you. 'Tis true, I'm an aristocrat. I'm Hassan Ben Sober. I had a few too many my self. [LAUGHS] Quiet. We gotta clean up this mess. Why you... Get busy. [MUMBLING] Stop it, will you? Cut it out. MAN: Travel by night. Perhaps it-- Greetings. Greetings Did you bring the map, Hoffa Dolla. Aye, chief. But as I slit his throat... [GROANS] ...with his dying breath he said someone else had a duplicate map. 'Tis bad. We must leave at once if we are to be the first to reach King Rootin Tootin's tomb. Make preparations to depart immediately. Aye, chief. But remember the curse. "He who touches the jewel first, is doomed to a thousand deaths." We must secure the services of three. Then when we get them to do our bidding... Yes, but we best have food before we travel. Boys, we just gotta find a way to get the money for our sweethearts. I got it! I got it. I got it. He's got it. Tell us, kid. What do you got? A terrific headache. Oh, I'll cure that. MAN: Service! Waiters! Service! Waiters! Here we are, at your service. Oh! What'll you have? We want a-- We don't have anymore. All we got left is rabbit and hot dogs. Rabbit. Hot dog. Hot dog! I'll take rabbit. Okay, coming up. Coming right up. Coming right now. Here we are, pepper and salt. [MEOWING] Scat! Come here. Come here, you. [MEOWING] LARRY: Well, I'll fix you. [MUMBLING] [CLEARS THROAT] Here. [MEOWING] [CAT MEOWING] [THUD] [MEOWING] [THUD] [MEOWING] [MEOWING] [CAT SCREECHING] [THUDDING] Catsup. Cat!

Now, you stay here, you be a good boy. You're gonna sit there. [BARKING] [BARKS] [DOG CRIES] [THUDDING] Here you are, gentlemen. Hot dogs. When it comes to cooking I'm the cat's meow. Sit down. Oh, but I'm not tired. I'll just stand while you eat. Sit down with your heads on or off. Y-You talked us into it. Eat! Eat! [BARKS] Did you hear anything? Yeah, I did. [MEOWING] Sit down and eat.

This just can be. [CAT SCREECHES] [SCREAMS] [HUMMING] Forgot the mustard. So you are the perpetrator of this. Sit down and eat. Sit down. A pleasure. Thank you. [MUMBLES] [GROWLS, MEOWS] [SCREAMS] [CRASH] [ALL CLAMORING] [DOG BARKS] [MEOWING] [SIGHS] There's the dog and cat. Why didn't you tell me? What? Shut up. Let him alone. You too. Oh, cut it out. Oh! [BOTH GRUNT] These three. They are the ones to get the jewel for us. Right. Gentlemen. Who came in? No, you. How would you boys like to make a thousand shilbleenas? You've convinced us. What do we have to do? There is a diamond worth a king's ransom. You hear, a king's ransom. Gentlemen. This map will lead us to the treasure. Now, please. Pay attention-- [SOBBING] Ruin, defeated. That murderist cutthroat. He has the famous 100-karat diamond. A hundred karats? He sure knew his onions. [CHUCKLES] Quiet. This map is useless to me now. With that diamond I could've quit my job as the doorman at the Oasis Hotel. [SOBBING] Hey, spinach chin. Do you mean to tell me you're only a doorman? Yes. Well, there's the door, man. Will you give me five for this? No, but I'll give you two. I'll take it. Shut up. [CRASH] Moe. The Emir of Shmow stole that Rootin Tootin diamond. Yeah, and we're gonna get it back from him. Return it to its rightful owner. Get a big reward and then pay the taxes for our sweethearts. Yeah, but the Emir of Shmow is a cutthroat. Suppose he cuts my throat? So, you'll look like you have two mouths. I'll look like I-- Now pay attention. Come here. Now, here's the plan. [MAN LAUGHING] There he is. And he's wearing the diamond. [LAUGHING] Now is our chance to get it. Yeah. [GROWLING] See Fi Fo Fum. I'm the evil spirit that guards the Rootin Tootin diamond. Give it to me, lest evil befall you. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Oh, hide, quick. Somebody's coming. Moe, scram. [GRUNTS] [ALL GRUNTING] [ALL SCREAMING] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa. Here hold it. I'll kill you. [GUARD SCREAMS] [WOMEN SCREAMING] You big, big men. Frightening us defenseless women. How dare you invade the privacy of us frail women? And you caught me with my veil down. [SCREAMS] Take this, you coward, you rude, you-- You should be ashamed of yourselves. Scaring us helpless girls. You. You wolf you. I'll teach you, leave us little lambs alone. [SCREAMS] Get out of here. [SCREAMS] Hey, Larry, scram. SHEMP: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Moe! Larry! [CLAMORING] SHEMP: Moe, help! [SHEMP YELLING] Moe, help! Halt! Hello. Hello. [BIRD CHIRPING] Hey, listen. We gotta get out of here. Return the diamond and pay our girls' taxes. Come on. Go on, you heard the guy. [YELLING] GUARD: I kill you! Oh. [♪♪♪]
