In 1958, the Albatross company donated the rights and surviving elements of its productions to the Cinémathèque française. Co-produced by Marcel L'Herbier's Cinégraphic, The Late Mathias Pascal is one of these productions. For this film the Cinémathèque française bought the rights corresponding to the Société Albatross' contribution and received materials which had until then been owned by the studio. Curator Henri Langlois made a print in 1964 from the original negative of The Late Mathias Pascal. The negative having since been lost, that print is the source for the present copy. The tints were reintroduced according to a vintage nitrate print deposited at the Cinémathèque by Marcel L'Herbier in 1958. This restored edition was made in 2009 with the support of the Franco-American Cultural Foundation (DGA - MPAA - WGA - SACEM) in the laboratory of L'Immagine Ritrovata. Music composed and conducted by Timothy Brock Recorded in a live performance on June 28, 2009 by The Orchestra of the Municipal Theatre of Bologna Deed of Sale Madame Maria Pascal (Wife of Lucca Pascal, deceased) Acting on behalf of her son Mathias Pascal and her sister-in-law Scolastica Pascal authorizes her estate manager Batta Maldagna to sell her San Rocchino Estate for the sum of 1 00,000 lire In fact, the treacherous Maldagna is ruining poor, debt-ridden Madame Pascal by purchasing "San Rocchino" at far less than its real value, estimated at 600,000 lire at the death of Lucca Pascal. MATTHIAS PASCAL AT WORK Do not disturb "Don't worry ...he's working." Since childhood, Mathias Pascal has been a tormented dreamer, pursuing a fanciful hope: to be a free man ... ...to be master of his Destiny.... A History of Liberty By Mathias Pascal The cart man explains: "We have orders from Mr. Maldagna to cut down the beech trees." to sell her "San Rocchino" Estate read and approved. Batta Maldagna " ...that ...or seizure of our property." "Calm down ! Your mother has grief enough as it is ..." The jolly, naïve Pomino, nicknamed "Mino," is particularly nervous at the thought of letting the ascetic Mathias into the great secret of his life. Unfortunately for "Mino," irritated Mathias is just going out. Later, young Romilde dreams about Mathias whom she secretly admires. She submits meekly to her self-serving mother, widow Pescatore, who wants to marry her off to a rich man. At last, Mino can pour out his poor little heart. " ...A real Angel ! I’d do anything for her! But l haven't the nerve to speak to her!" At the carnival tonight, give her a message. Ask for her hand - for me ..." Holiday time in Miragno - The bonfires have already been lit. "Look ...there she is!" To give Mathias time to persuade Romilde ... "A charming but shy young man has asked me to tell you ...that he loves you." "Yes ... well you can tell that young man that ... I’ve long had ...the same feelings ... about him." " ...May l ask for your hand ...for him?" "So ...it's me ... that ...you?" Forgetting Mino, Mathias is overwhelmed by this unexpected new sensation of happiness ... And so fate brings together the freedom-loving Mathias and the most charming of wives ... ...and the most heinous of mothers-in-law. Don't you have anything better to do than pester my daughter!" "Why, Mathias isn't pestering me at all." And this is the usual scene. Under her mother's influence, the behavior of the weak-willed Romilde towards Mathias has already changed. "Goodbye! l won't keep living under the same roof as that good-for-nothing." All that kept Mathias home was the thought of his coming fatherhood and the desire not to leave his mother. HIS MOTHER! The only real love left to him except for the child that would soon be born. The birth of a little girl filled Mathias with childish delight. Today is the great day: appointed assistant librarian, Mathias begins his job at the Municipal Library. "Stop pestering my daughter!" Mathias arrives at work full of enthusiasm: "Work means liberty" Set up in a deconsecrated church, this library was a strange place. The Rat That Withdrew From the World by Aesop The chief librarian But at night, after "work" "Madame Pascal is very ill. She wants to see her granddaughter." "Yes, tomorrow. It's too late tonight." "But ...this is serious. It has to be tonight." Mathias wasn't told about this scene. So the next day, he had no cause to be worried. A SHORT POCKET GUIDE TO RAT-HUNTING "Your mother is very ill and you didn't come ..." "I want to see the baby ...last night THEY wouldn't let me ..." "I'll bring her myself ... l promise you." "Romilde? She went for the doctor. Your daughter is sick." "It’s difficuIt to diagnose. There's nothing to do but wait." On this train taking him away from a detestable home life after weeks of mourning, Mathias recalls how he decided to take this liberating trip. Still grief-stricken, he saw everything as if in a dream. That night, in these notorious rooms where the GAMBLING TABLES held their victims in thrall ... Mathias slowly feels the temptation. "BETS ARE CLOSED" "You must be new to the game. A piece of advice..." "1 2...play the 1 2!" "PLACE YOUR BETS!" Mathias plays his own hunch ... Midnight - Defying all the odds, Mathias is on a winning streak that gradually surprises even the most blasé of players. 1 :55 A.M. Five minutes to closing. Mathias has broken all the records. "LAST TWO ROUNDS!" "NO MORE BETS!" His final bet. Mathias plays everything on ... "NUMBER 1 2!" Now a weaIthy man, Mathias almost subconsciously feels the lure of house and home. A few days later he is on the train to Miragno ... By wire from Miragno: Last Saturday, the body of a man in a state of advanced decomposition was found drowned in a millrace. The body is thought to be that of the librarian, Mathias Pascal. This suicide is believed to be the resuIt of grief and debt. "This is awful! I’m dead!" At the next stop, determined to set the distressing record straight. I’m not dead. Home tomorrow. Suddenly a thought strikes Mathias. Being dead means escaping all earthly woes. It means no more enemies. No more creditors. No more hostile wife. No more mother-in-law. Being dead means FREEDOM "I’m changing...trains!" A man without a past arrives in the Eternal City. Unhindered and nameless - a new man. And with a new heart ... Now dressed less conspicuously, the Late Mathias headed for the best luxury hotel. Terence Papiano, Esq. Archaeologist Tours of Rome, Day and Night "...a lot of luggage?" "Suite 3 - 400 lire a night." Identity Form (required by the police) "The dead travel fast!" The late Mathias is no exception. Forced to flee, running in utter confusion, he begins to think Freedom has something bitter about it. ROOM FOR RENT "The room to rent? Certainly, my daughter will show it to you." ADRIENNE! "l hope this will suit you ... May I have your name?" "My name? ...I call myself Monsieur Adrien. Does that bother you?" "Don't mind the books. They're my poor father's passion. l detest them myseIf!" SPIRITUALISM SPIRITUALISM HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD Unfortunately, this drunken woman is one of Paleari's boarders. What a bad impression it would make on the new lodger. "It’s Miss Caporale, my father's medium. She's had a hard life - she drinks a little. But she's an artist - she sings well !" This strange household worried Mathias. And if that wasn't enough ... "Please excuse me for not being dressed earlier. l would like you to meet my dear Adrienne's fiancé." "A distinguished archaeologist, Terence Papiano." "l hope you aren't leaving, Monsieur Adrien?" Within a few months, "Adrien" begins to take to the lovely, wholesome Adrienne. It helps that odious Terence left on a trip the day of his arrival. Unfortunately, Terence is due home tonight and his borderline hysterical brother Scipion has dutifully spied on the "stranger." SPIRITUALISM HOW TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE DEAD "Those damned spirits! Miss Caporale has been using them to persuade my poor father to marry me off to that Terence - whom I hate!" Very much in love with Adrienne but deprived of his identity, he is in no position to free her from Terence by marrying her himself. "Adrien" suffers more and more from being a NOBODY. MARRIAGES 2 WITNESSES REQUIRED "…and that lodger …still here?" Miss Caporale is also Terence's assistant. "So ...he is rich?" " ...and ...he loves her?" "Call Adrienne!" "Monsieur Adrien!" "Do come in, Monsieur Adrien… we were just talking about you." "My future father-in-law is about to hold a very unusual séance. We'll be communicating with the dead. We hope you'll join us." "Get dressed and join us as soon as possible in the "Magic Room". The séance. SPIRITS Knock once for 'yes' and twice for 'no'. "Will my daughter be happily married to Terence?" "It’s nothing; stay here! It’s just that these experiments are too much for my poor brother." "I’ve been robbed - 50,000 lire!" "I’m going to report this to the police. Say nothing until I get back." "That's a promise?" "Someone has stolen 1 00,000 lire from Monsieur Adrien!" "It’s TERR…" "It’s a mistake. I found my money. There was no theft." "A change of air would do your brother a world of good." "Leave Rome with him ..." "...without further delay." To be robbed, and unable to file a complaint, in danger, and unable to defend himself, in love, and unable to fulfill his happiness; these were the privileges "Monsieur Adrien" had brought to Mathias Pascal ... and Mathias Pascal was tired of being dead for nothing. "I’m leaving - a few days - personal business. I'll forgive you not keeping your word, if you promise not to marry Terence - at least not until l get back!" Soon after, Mathias ... Nightfall, the following day ... Mathias found himself in front of his memory-haunted house. "Who is it?" "Mathias" "Who?" "The late Mathias Pascal" "Where have you been?" "In the next world!" "Romilde? I want to see her!" "...Remarried?" " ...You were dead ..." "You see - you can't stay!" "I have the Civil Code in my favour. In such cases, the first husband has the right to take back his place. It’s the second husband who has to go." "So I’m free to stay, AND I'M STAYING!" The next morning, the streets of Miragno are jammed with holiday crowds. Have no fear, I’m leaving for Rome (on urgent business). Be happy with your child. Mathias Living happily means living in hiding ... Mathias, his papers now in order, steals down the deserted streets towards the station ...
