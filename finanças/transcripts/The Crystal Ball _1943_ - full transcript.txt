How cold it is! What are we searching for? Your ... your emerald ring, Mrs. Ainsley. It has disappeared. I looked for it everywhere. Do not be silly. Can not be! Wow, I took it the other afternoon. I... It must have fallen somewhere. I looked for it all over the room. Up to... Even on all fours. Well, I guess we better call the police. Yes, Mrs. Ainsley. Why are you crying? It was my ring! I 'm sure the police will suspect me immediately, ma'am. And when I tell them that I arrived only three weeks ago, they'll think I stole it. Silly stuff! How do I know you didn't steal it? I wouldn't have warned you that it was missing, ma'am. Perhaps. It would be very smart of you. I'm afraid I'm not that smart, ma'am. Of course, if you wish, I 'll call the police. No, it doesn't matter, I guess. Thank you, Mrs. Ainsley. I guess I must have left it somewhere ... What a pity! I really liked that ring. For now. Lady please don't make fun of me but I think I know how you can get it back. Retrieve it from where? Wherever I am. Before I used to work for a lady in ... ... 7th Street, East, and lost a pearl necklace. - Really? -Yes. Oh, but we got it back. And no one would have thought of looking for him where he was. Nor to us, if not for that Mrs. ... ... Lovia, or Zovia, ... What was her name? Who are you talking about? From a fortune teller. She told us where to look and there it was. The dog ... had swallowed it. But I don't have a dog! A fortune teller! Is it really good? He believed that those kinds of people had disappeared. Give me the phone book, will you? Yes, Mrs. Ainsley. What was that woman's name? I do not remember. I think it started with zeta. Why zeta? U, V, W, X... - Horses. - ¿horses? - No, zeta. - Oh, zeta. And he's also a spirit medium, ma'am. Perhaps if you want, she will put you in touch with your late husband. Not even dreaming about it! Zalla, Zenner,... Zenobia. "Madame Zenobia. Character fortune - teller pythoness ." Is that the name? Yes, exactly. Stop moving. How is it? It is a ring with a large emerald and two diamonds on each side. And it's in your bathroom sink drain . And listen baby I know what he's gonna pay you so don't try to fool me. Wow, Foster! God knows we were always half-hearted. You know you would have heard me scream if you didn't. The soup is very good. Is there more? No, it is not. I'm leaving then. Bye. Goodbye, Miss Foster. Goodbye. - Bye, Nobie. - Bye, Dusty. Where do you work now? In a government office. That 's where the money is today. It does not hit, but he learns a lot. Give the government time if you want. I'll continue with the ladies' restrooms. Customers. Probably some pachyderm who wants to know ... ... what does her husband see in a young woman with a size 40. Bye. Vale. Good afternoon. Hi. What is it called, the one with the hands? When Yen. I even find it in the soup. I wouldn't be surprised. Do you want to consult me? His label says he knows what my future is. So is. Then I do want to consult you. Come inside, will you? Wait a moment. How much do you charge? What you think is worth. Well, when it hits 38 cents, stop. You see, that's all I have left. Or maybe it's a day of opportunities. Pass. Sit here, dear. You don't have to do all that for me; not for that price. Are you trying to teach me my trade? I'm sorry. Go on ... whatever you were doing. Very well. A man was mean to you. I can see you turned it down. Do you only see one? - Why? - Because there were nine. Nine? One after another? No, at the same time. They were judges. Nine judges? What the hell did he do? Sign up for a beauty pageant. Who won, a blonde? Don't blondes always win every contest? Let's see, did you want to ask me something in particular? Yes. Look in your pocket and tell me where I'm going to sleep tonight, will you? Have you nowhere to go? No ma'am. Does not have money? Well I got the 38 cents that I mentioned to you, a new wardrobe and a silver goblet. And what will you do? I was hoping you would tell me. - Are you trying to find a job? - Naturally! Don't ... have a family? I have a grandfather in Texas, but he doesn't pass beauty pageants. He says he doesn't understand why a woman should ... ... win an award for having everything on your site. A character is created. And wouldn't you send him a ticket back home? I suppose so, if I admit that I am wrong. I had a ticket, ... but I sold it. I guess I shouldn't have, but ... He lived on a pig farm next to Highwater. Where is that? Next to Waco, that's next to Fort Worth. That has been the story of my life, Madame Zenobia. Right next to something. Can you see inside me if there can be any change? They wouldn't know we're at war in Highwater ... ... if it weren't for the price of pork going up. That's why I went to the beauty pageant. For the price of the pigs? No. You see, the winner of the national contest ... ... got an artist contract to perform in Army camps. Are you an artist? What does? Well, I act with a whip and a rifle, ... ... and I take the cigarette out of people's mouths. What people? He believed that it was probably soldiers, volunteers from the public. Maybe it's a good thing that he didn't win the ... ...competition. The army could have casualties. No, I'm really a good shooter. - As it is called? - Toni Gerard. If she's as good a shooter as she says, Maybe I can get her hired at Pop Tibbets. Whose? From Pop Tibbets. Run a target shooting gallery next door. All you have to do is pretend that you are a customer; do flourishes by shooting until you draw the crowd. It goes, comes back and starts again. Like a decoy. Well, I didn't exactly come to New York for that, ... ... but it's the best deal I've had today. Hey, I have a room in the back where you can settle ... ... until you find something, you can occupy it. You are very kind. Don't be fooled. I do it because I see the future. I may even take advantage of it. Did you see it in your crystal ball? No, baby I saw it when you crossed your legs. Let's go see Pop. Come in, friends! Come in! Twelve shots for a quarter! They won't let a little girl teach them how to do it, eh? What do you say, son? No, leave it to me. You will see. Cats going down the hill. How much? 50 cents for you. A good shot for a young lady. It's a good shot for anyone. It is true. Come back, miss. Gee, isn't she gorgeous, dad? You should never trust pretty women who can shoot like this. Here it is. What a neighborhood! Jeez fleas! Fleas, fortune tellers, ... What difference does it make? I guess you're not coming with me, are you, Brad? No. Long sea voyages make me sick ... ... and I don't want any tall dark men. Well, if you tell me I'll find one, I'll tell you I already have one. Give me time to check it out, precious. The time has changed! Do you remember the ... ... Marilyn Miller show right across the street? I remember the one with the gypsy Rose Lee on this sidewalk. Do you remember when you drove this car every night ... ... of the week and ... they gave you speeding tickets? Yes! That was in the good old days! What do you say, miss? Come in and see. It won't hurt you to learn to hit your mark, you know. What do you say, miss? Come in and see. I said, "What are you saying, miss?" Of course we have time. Let's go! Well, I don't know whether to obey you, boss. Then... ... of everything, democracy is one thing, ... ... but if you shoot in public with your driver, ... ... people will think you lost your job. Wait a minute. When you were at that bowling alley ... ... and I went to school, I worked for you, right? Sure, but that was to become a lawyer. Okay, I'm already a lawyer. Come on, I dare you for a dollar. Couldn't it be fifteen? Like a loan ... ¿Quince? I really need you, boss. After all, what is 15 bucks for a tycoon like you. 15 bucks! 50 cents if you're done, miss. Oh no. I'm not done yet. No thanks. Who is the girl this time? The same, Iphigenia. He's cheating on you with a cop. Oh no! He's a cousin of hers. He swore it to me ... almost. Couldn't you borrow them from your income tax? Not in any way. - Aim for Mussolini. - Stinker. Three shots. Hit the target twice. Your turn. Put it back on. You owe me a dollar. You're ruining me I bet you five. It will give you the opportunity to remake yourself. Yes, but what about the fifteen? The law has tonsils. He cannot swallow. Well that's great. It will be cheap to invite her to dinner. Five bucks? Well OK. Why should I say bubbles? Oh my God! I do not know. Mire. Look! - What happens? Don't you see it? It almost blinds me. A huge emerald; an emerald in the bubbles. Are you kidding me? A man tries to tell me something. This man is her husband. He's very young, but he's dead. Look, ma'am, ... He tells me that you lost the emerald; to look for her in the bedroom. Are you sure it's Jack? And in the bathroom ... - In the bathroom? - And in the drains ... Thank goodness Jack is back from the grave, right? 15 dollars. I must have a char in my eye. Thank's cousin. Someone is honking our horn. - Goodbye. - Thank you. - His eyes healed, huh? - Yes. They are beautiful, right? That's what I mean, Mr. Tibbets. It has all six. Six what? He's generous, has a sense of humor and, obviously things are going well for him, but he's not a snob. He is handsome,... ... and quite a gentleman. He is not a ladyboy. - How do you know? - Because he didn't even look at me. Maybe I'm anemic. Try a revolver, miss. Well, did he tell you where the ring was? - Of course. - I dont believe it. Where have you been? Healing tonsils. What have you been doing, shooting the mouth? Is my girlfriend. Oh yours. The shots make me so nervous that ... Do you know her, Brad? Not because? Does not matter. Let's go, Biff. I want to make an appointment with a plumber. I'm so sorry I woke you up in the middle of the night like this ... Don't worry, ma'am. Day or night, my motto is: "stay in shape". Here it is. I guess this is what I was looking for. ¡Oh, Brad! It's a little wet. Oh Brad, he saw it in the crystal ball , dripping and all. You should give towels with your omens. I promised him $ 100, and give this man $ 100 too. The 5 dollars or something. Dejémoslo in a 10%, ¿eh? Well, what do you think of fortune tellers now? I think you should take the rings off when you wash your hands. Oh, you are an unbeliever. Well, anyway, I have Madame Zenobia to thank for something. He made you come here. Isn't it great? Yes, me and the plumber, precious. Why doesn't it go away? You won't really believe that this woman ... ... he saw your ring in his crystal ball , right? If not, how could he know ... where it was? And how did you find out about my late husband? He also mentioned it to me. 30 seconds is enough to consult the civil registry. My ring was not in the civil registry, but in the drain. Jo, for a smart girl, ... I'm not smart, thank God. I don't think women should be. It's a man's thing. Women shouldn't have a say; just feel. You know, Brad, I feel really good. Hopefully one day you will realize it. I fix it? Yes. Sometimes it costs, but I always say it is worth a try. I always believe that too. Thank you. Well, good night, Mr. Ainsley. Goodnight. Hey, I'm not Mr. ...! You called me Mr. Ainsley. How about? - Seem right. You love to embarrass me, right? Let me give you a friendly, free and helpful little tip : Someday you will feel ashamed. What does that mean? It means don't be like that. You could hurt yourself. Good night, Jo. Goodnight Sweetheart. I wonder what it would be like to talk to a man like him. Men are men. They all always say the same thing. But a man like that ... I wonder how he would put it. To say that? Well, you know, what men say ... Well it could be... But the same thing always happens. Madame Zenobia, why do you put the ... ... so nervous shooting at Mrs. Ainsley? Her husband died in a hunting accident . I don't know what he was hunting. Wasn't that man Mr. Ainsley? As far as I know, it has been one day. His name is Cavanaugh. He is your trustee ... ... or your agent or your lawyer, or something like that. Some women always land on their feet. Hey, those judges were idiots. Thank you. He wouldn't think that if he had seen that blonde. She bombards from a great height. I don't know what all that information is for! I told Mrs. Ainsley to take an option on a property, right? I even went into a trance. And you know what it costs me. I know you get cramps in a trance. I'm sorry. But if you don't buy it the next day, the government will keep it. They take it seriously. I wish people would stop using it as an ashtray! If you don't buy it, you won't get a percentage. Nor me. Of course he will buy it. I told him there was oil on the ground. Petroleum? That lawyer will never buy it, Nobie. Yes. I was thinking about him. I have to convince that lawyer. Where did I put my ectoplasm? - You dream awake again. - Oh, there it is! You know very well that he will not go to see fortune tellers. Listen, I have an invitation to the Navy charity bazaar. - And I have a conscience. - Awareness? Shut up, would you?! Come on, give me a push. Oh come on, crystal ball. I have to see him again. Give me a sign. I got it! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! What happened?! - You removed the ladder! - No, I did not do it. Let go! I'm fine. Oh, it happened again. Oh what have you done? My iliac sacrum fails. It leaves your site. Go find a doctor, Dusty. Did it break? It scrolled. Don't worry, I'll be fine in a couple of weeks or so. For you? I worry about the lawyer. What about the bazaar? You can not go. Scoundrel! I'm sitting here with my back shattered and you ... I wish I could do something to help. Thanks babe. - What are you going to do, Nobie? - Hears,... What happens? Yes, whats up? I wore this veil for fun. It's Christmas, Dusty. Do you believe? She is a smart girl. It will work out for you. Voucher. I hope you know what you do. Someone has to go. I'll get the doctor. Merry Christmas, little girl! What did he mean by that? He's just happy because you're going to a party. - To a party? -Yes. There is the invitation, on the table. Read it. BENEFICIAL BAZAR IN THE TUDOR ROOM OF THE SHERIDAN-PLAZA HOTEL Madame Zenobia, it's about those people, ... ... of those men, of that man ... Of that man. Could I see you up close? Do you think it could? Of course yes, that's why you will go And while you're talking to him, I want you to give him a little advice from me. Talk to him?! I want you to go to this bazaar in my place. With that veil on your face no one will notice the difference. I could not. Come on, I don't know anything about ... You don't need it, just look at the crystal ball. Naturally, you won't be able to materialize anything ... ... or do things like that. But, Madame Zenobia, what if she enters ... ... Mrs. Ainsley or someone who already knows her? You will notice the voice, ... ...he does not believe? It's a piece of cake. Use a system. What system? Make it. Use an Indian. It is ideal to camouflage the voice. Of all ... ... modes, most fortune tellers use them. Why? I do not know why! I don't know why an Indian gets so smart just by dying. I'll tell you everything you have to say. All right, Madame Zenobia, I'll try. It's ... it's almost like fate, right? Fate is worth it, as long as you take it and take it your way. I see what you mean. And there is another thing about mediums: they are always careful. The supernatural is fine up to a point, but ... ... make a list of the people who will be there. Look at the map in the library. An old saying goes: "The wisest prophets verify the event before." Therefore, in addition to using the books, ... ... do some comedy to those present. Look, I'm surprised that the mayor is interested ... ... by my nervous system. It's a miracle! Well it seems that with recent events and everything else, there are all kinds of things that scare, and we think that if you knew something in ... ... particular that he never told anyone. Well, let's see. I can think of only one thing ... my God! There is something that I never told anyone. That's exactly ... I mean, that's what we're trying to find out. Well ... I suffer from phobia. You what? Phobophobia. I mean, I'm afraid of being afraid of something. I see. I don't understand it, but the psychoanalysts say that she gave me as a child. She was a very shy girl. Nothing shows me now. But my mother ... my mother used to hide me when visitors came. Now I hide myself. Are you hiding alone? Like a crazy. Well, it influences my whole life. I'm even hiding from Mr. Smythe, you know. At first he thought it was a game and ... Well, he enjoyed it quite a bit. But he found out that I suffered from phobophobia. It was a hard blow for him. Sure, it must have been. What did? Hide too. We haven't seen each other for centuries! Mrs. Smythe Wacky! How are you? I'm from the Civil Defense Office. And I would like to ask you a few questions about your home. We have sand. Yes, but who lives here? That is to say,... Well, the boss lives. Mr. Cavanaugh lives here. I'm Biff Carter. And we also have candles. Oh perfect. Well, can you tell me something about Mr. Cavanaugh? I mean something in particular. Is it from Passive Defense? Well, not exactly, but ... In case something happens to Mr. Cavanaugh, ... ... that is, in case someone had to identify you, ... ... do you have birthmarks or something similar? - Brands, huh? -Yes. Look, for example, in your report it says ... ... you have huge biceps. And a beautiful torso. Does that put on me? But ... but it doesn't say anything about Mr. Cavanaugh here. Well I guess it fits my description, yes sir! Yes. I'm cleaning the silver. Pass. Thank you. Yes. I try to keep everything always clean. Every morning... Yes, but about Mr. Cavanaugh ... Yes, the boss has distinctive markings, of course, but he's very fussy. Why? They are not seen. Or if? Oh no, ma'am. Those marks are something between him and me. Perfect! As they are? Shot scars. Give me your pencil. They are very ugly. Look, they are like this. Nobody else knows. Can you tell me...? I mean ... where exactly do you have them? Well, if a kid stole a watermelon in the field ... ... and escaped from a furious farmer ... Yes, I see. Danish silver. Hi dear. Looks like there is going to be a good party tonight. Charity, sweet charity. Your store is downstairs near the kissing store . O'Brien, ... put gin ... in a glass of water ... ... and when the time comes, take it with you ... ... to the fortune teller. Don't let your throat dry out. Ok aunt. Hi, Lorraine. Want to try your luck with a kiss, Mr. Cavanaugh? It never does. I assure. It's going well. Everything will go to the bottom of the sailors' widows. With that much money, the Navy will be able to widen those pants. - Let's Dance. - Agree. How are you? I said, "How are you?" Well, are you mute? The spirit of a southern lady speaks through my lips ... It controls me. It's me. Really? Well of course I don't believe a word but put to do ... Go ahead! Wow, I see her do something very special. ¿Particular? He's hiding ... under a sofa. And there is a man, her husband, that seeks and seeks it, but cannot find it. He says he's been looking for her for years ... It's amazing. Simply amazing. It is something I never told anyone. And I see something else! There is another man. And it's here ... How is it? Sure they were unbearable people, but you did very well. By the way, Brad, thanks for negotiating the purchase of the lot for me. Don't give them to me. Is your money. Why would someone ... You will die of jealousy when you see that I make my own gasoline. Me! You! You can't imagine ... He said some things to me! - Who? - Madame Zenobia. Things I never told anyone. You see it? I already told you. That woman has a real gift. Yes. I think it does. - Find a man, Jo. - As all! Nerd. To one man in particular. I will repeat it. What does it tell you how much I am convenient for you? No need for a fortune teller to tell me that. And it is here. You have perceived it. He says that he is in this room and that he has an incredible message for him. Who? Well, this is a photograph of him. I hope it is not a story. Let me see if I recognize you ... It's hard to see him, right? I imagine it will be some kind of reincarnated spirit, Don't you think What is that? Where did you get this from? Madame Zenobia gave it to me. Do you know it? Oh no. Of course not. Excuse me... Whoops! Hi. Are you Madame Zenobia? How do you say? Le dio hipo? Great Indian Chief speak through my mouth. Well, someone told me that the one with the veil over her face had a message for me. Well. Big White Chief sit down, huh? How did you hear about them? Great Indian Chief have eyes ... ... from beyond the grave. See things. Do you mean you can see them? As clear as seeing you sitting there. Fuck me! Damn me. Well, Big White Chief hear message from Great Indian Chief? It's okay. Which? Great Indian Chief see Great White Chief's lady ... ... drowning in oil. Land with deposit. Petroleum greatly enrich everyone. You must buy it for women. I've already bought it for the lady. And you might recognize that you are correct in your predictions. But there is no oil within 300 miles of Pell County. What happens? What happens to him? Have ... some water. No. Wait! Great Indian Chief have another message. I've had enough messages already. Thank you very much. Of this. Of this? How do you know about them? What does he do, hide and spy? Great Indian Chief great spy. Great White Chief very happy if you come back soon. Happy about what? Happy for squaw. Great Indian see redhead squaw take Great White Chief to his teepee. What do you mean by that? One day to another. Morning. Find it. Crush, wham! Eating place. Would you like to speak Christian, please? Great Indian Chief does not know how to speak white language. And you say I'll meet ... a girl tomorrow ... ... to a redhead in a restaurant? Remember, redhead. Chewing apple ... Well, you see, there are two reasons why that won't happen. First of all, tomorrow is Saturday and I 'm going to play golf in the afternoon. Second, I'll go to a restaurant that doesn't allow red-haired squaws. So I'm afraid all that remains of his vision is to chew an apple. Great White Chief see him. Wait for a place to eat. Morning. Sorry to disappoint Great Indian Chief. ¡Already! Well, I'll be on the golf course if you need me for something important. You know, I feel kind of guilty about leaving. Silly stuff! It has to go. The man will come to sign the contract of ... ... War Production. It's ready, right? Well, practically. I modified a clause, Lorie. Goodbye. Mr. Cavanaugh's office. Listen! It's Mr. Stukov. Wants to talk to you. You better talk to him, Brad. He's frantic. A customer found a mouse in the kettle and threatens to sue him and leave him naked. A customer what? He found a mouse ... in his kettle. Say? I am Cavanaugh. What's going on? Heavens! Look, the mouse in the kettle thing ... ... is the oldest ruse in the world. Give the customer lunch, give him 10 bucks, and tell him never to come back. But he doesn't want me to give him lunch. Neither does the 10 bucks. I've even offered him 20 bucks. He says I have taken away his appetite for the rest ... ... of his life and that I should call my lawyer. They're fine, calm down. It comes almost in passing. I 'm coming. Call the Club and advise that I will be arriving an hour later. As soon as he's done with it, he wo n't even remember the mouse. There you have the mouse con artist , Mr. Cavanaugh. There it is. Talk to her. - Oh yeah. My name is Toni Gerard. Pleasure. How are you? Mr. Stukov told me he had a little problem. Well, it's really upsetting to open the kettle and get a ... I can't even say the word. And with such a long tail! Mr. Cavanaugh, there are no mice in my restaurant. - Did you see it? - Yes, I saw it. But, Mr. Cavanaugh, she sure brought it. There are no mice in my restaurant. Did you bring it? Do I have the face of taking dead mice for a walk or not, Mr. Cavanaugh? Well, not really. But neither did Mr. Stukov. - No? - And you? No mice, Mr. Cavanaugh. I put the tea bag myself. And I suppose tail must have sprung out of that bag ... ... of tea, and mustaches too, Mr. Cavanaugh. He was staring at me. It was horrible. There is always a way to fix these things. Well, what would you consider ...? - That? - How much do you want. The truth is, I didn't want to put you on trial, Mr. Stukov. I just thought I'd scare him a little so it wouldn't happen again. It was awful, you know. I will probably never be able to eat again. I see. And are you willing to change ... ... opinion in exchange for being apologized? Absolutely. Well, that seems very strange to me, Stukov. There is nothing wrong with a person like ... ... Miss Gerad, obviously well educated ... I don't know anything about education, Mr. Cavanaugh. But I do know that there are no mice in my restaurant. And if there was a mouse in her kettle, she put it. For what purpose? Yes, you are absolutely right, you know. Why the hell would he bring a dead mouse to his restaurant? - Please. - I'm sorry. But he heard her say she didn't want to ... ... absolutely nothing about you, except maybe ... ... clean your restaurant a little better . ¡Sr. Cavanaugh! Yes. With mice like this this time. Who knows... ... how could they be next time! Exactly! Teapots are only that big! Miss Gerard. If you're not too upset, how about ... ... if you have lunch with me? Elsewhere. ¡Sr. Cavanaugh! No thank you very much. I'm not hungry. Every time I close ... ... the eyes ... - I know. Don't think about it. He was going to the country club anyway. Come with me. You will forget it. Okay,... There is a lot of gas left and I drive a stroller. All right, I'll go. And please forget about this incident, Mr. Stukov. I'm sure it wasn't his fault. Not with those little eyes. - You are fired! - I am fired... That I am fired? Look at putting dead mice in lovely ladies' teapots! ¡Sr. Stukov! Where are you from, Miss Gerard? From Texas, huh? - Deeply. I suppose you will find New York very different. Not much. In Texas the coyotes howl , here the wolves ... Well, we can't blame him, you know. It is dangerous business to show them red hair. Listen! Any. You won't believe in fate or anything to do with it, right? Of course not. I think things ... ... they happen because you choose them. Why? Oh, for nothing. Fuck me! Do you know it was the first time I went to ... ... Stukov's restaurant for over a year? I don't blame him. There is no doubt that it is a very dirty place. Yes. But going today ... Fuck me. What are you talking about? To tell the truth, I'm not sure myself, but I guess it makes me feel wonderfully responsible. What do you mean? Well, I can't help her. You know, it's not my fault at all , do you understand? No, I do not understand. I mean, let's keep calm and let it happen. And what is going to happen? I think I remember there is a workshop nearby ... ...Of the road. Do you want to wait for me here? No! He believed that all the rich had a spare tire. With a rubber strip, I could fix it myself. Come on, a walk will do us good. Know what? I feel like a squaw walking behind you like this. Really? Really?! I imagine they won't have Indians in New York. In fact, I have an excellent Indian friend. Heavens! Seriously? And he also knows it. To me? - Do you know what he said? - That? He said that you give me much pleasure. What did he say?! Well, not exactly what it sounds like. You see, he doesn't express himself very well in English. And on top of that, ... he 's dead! It must be fun dating dead Indians. In fact, it is wonderful. I keep it in a lamp. Every time I need something, I just rub it. Oh, how practical. Much. He's my genius, with a long black mane. Won't you have a date with someone else tonight, dear Tony? Oh, no. Oh yeah! - That? Not that I'm exactly on a date, but I can't go out at night. I have to keep my old aunt company all ... ...the nights. At least one night a week or so. Can't read alone? You know, it's funny. She can read for other people, but not for herself. Yes. Very curious. Truth? After noon it is early. Nerd. I think I'd better take it ... ...to home. It is getting very late. Agree. Where do you live? You don't need to take me home. Anyway, I can take a taxi. - Don't be silly. Where do you live? - For the love of God! - Just here? - Here. Okay, bye, Mr. Cavanaugh. I accompany her. Okay, yes. Okay, bye, Mr. Cavanaugh. - I'll go up with you. - No. There was no more. But I prefer not to go up. I mean, don't bother. The apartment is on the top. Still I can do it. Then you will have to go back down. Well that's life! Here it is. What floor, please? - What floor? - Fifth. It's new. It's here. Goodbye, Mr. Cavanaugh. Sorry I can't invite you in. My aunt didn't ... ...it feels very good. I really can't. Do not worry. Nor did I ask. Forgot the key? Yes. In fact, I forgot. You better come downstairs and make a phone call. And what about the doorbell? No! Can't stand the noise of the doorbell! What about the noise of the phone? I mean, she says you can always ... ... hang up the phone if they nag you. But if one opens the door ... Well, it's another story. Yes. Maybe the door isn't locked. - Oh, no. - ¿No? She is very phobic. He never leaves it open. Never! He left it this time. Yes, he did, right? Okay, bye, Mr. Cavanaugh. The whole house looks like a clandestine distillery! But Darling,... Oh yeah, when I'm home you have work every night. But when I come back from visiting my mother for a day, take the opportunity to fill the house with your drunken buddies! Buddy huh? Sweetie, listen, they are your friends too. Really? Who came? Okay,... Hi. I guess you haven't seen her before. - She wasn't one of ... - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? You see, I ... You can swear I see. But you didn't expect to see me, did you? No, I didn't expect to see her. Well now I have to go. - Just a moment. - Just a moment. What did you come to? Go for whatever it was, but it goes without it. ¡Angela! And don't ever come back! Understand me?! Oh my dress suit! Shut up! What do you think about this? Biff. Yes Boss? If you knew a girl ... Well, suppose Iphigenia told you she would just come out ... ... with you in the afternoon, not at night, ... ...what would you think? Well, she's probably dating a better guy, boss. Do not be an idiot. This girl has only been around for two days ... ...In New York. He doesn't even know anyone. All right, don't be sulky. I was just trying to analyze it for you. Well, stop analyzing. Vale. Hey, boss. That? You and the widow, I mean, Mrs. Ainsley, ... ... are you dining here or going out tonight? We went out. But first he comes to have a cocktail. Can I ... take the night off? - Yes. - Thank you. Oh, on the way, take some flowers to someone for me, will you? I'll give you a note with them. Camelias. Sure, boss, ... ... but let them be gladioli. Camelias, ¿eh? Came... The service door is around the corner. Good man, please! I forgot something, George. Yes? Flowers ... for the lady. From Mr. Cavanaugh. Who is it, dear? "Thanks for the wonderful afternoon." "If one night he is not going to read to his old aunt," "let's start again!" Who are the flowers for? For you darling. From Mr. Cavanaugh. So is. And who is Mr. Cavanaugh? Don't give me who Mr. Cavanaugh is. So I'm your old aunt, huh? So going out in the afternoon, right? Whoops! You can return them to Mr. Cavanaugh. And tell him to plant the flowers in another garden. You were very lucky. At the last they destroyed half of his clothing. Watch out! Excuse me, Jo? Of course. What happened? Moron! You got the wrong apartment. I went to the one you told me to. You probably also got the wrong building. Or street. Or maybe I went to Chicago. Look, boss, ... What was the apartment like? Boss, there was a man ... There is no man in the apartment. He lives with his old aunt. That's what she said? Who lives with his old aunt? That?! Well, his elderly uncle, of course. Who else! They are for me? Of course, of course. I thought how we were going out to dinner and all that, you know ... Women often carry flowers ... What detail! They are somewhat withered. What a nice bouquet! Too bad it's not a horse. I,... - I'm leaving right away. -Yes. Will you go in there? Yes because? You don't care if I look, do you? Yes? You want? Excuse me I'm Brad Cavanaugh and ... So you are Brad Cavanaugh ... Yes, and he had the impression that a young woman lived here. Yes, he lives here. And I am his old aunt, whom he reads every night. And from now on, it will also do it every afternoon. Don Juan! You were the best of the three! Thank you. I'll be back in an hour. Wow, it's Mr. Cavanaugh! How are you? No ... we've seen each other a lot lately, right? We were wondering if you did something. Ninth! Toni, I ... Toni, I met your old aunt. You what ...? Who met my old aunt? And next time tell him you need a shave. And he will, and fight like a man. Coward. You already know these pioneers. This man is not a woman; not a pioneer. He is too much at home. If you're married ... why don't you say something? You don't think I care much, do you? Honey, I wanted to tell you about that man in the apartment. You see, I ... Low level! Excuse me. Wait a minute. I don't live there. I never lived there. You never lived there? Oh, no. I was completely wrong building, even street. No Please! You see, if you had lived on a pig farm ... I was confused. Give me an aspirin. Gee, it's like getting lost in the woods, or something. All these streets, ... I mean, so much building ... They are all the same. I'm sorry I hit you. And aren't you married? Oh no. I saw that man, and he hit me too. I mean, she tore my dress. He thought I was a thief. Where we go? I'm going to give you a monumental beating! Come here! Toni,... That? - You know what I'm doing? - That? I am invoking my dead Indian. You said you only did it if you wanted something. Exact. And good? Well what? Let's go! Say it. I have to say it? I would like you to do it. Really, Toni? You see, I've never heard of it in a situation like this. Brad, isn't that waiter ...? Yes! Stukov fired him. Oh, poor! Oh do not worry. He started working here the next day. Oh nice! Did you get him the job? Yes. He's not the right kind of person for that. Yes, I guess not. Wow, it's Brad Cavanaugh! Brad, where? Oh yeah, it's him. Well, dear? Well, a lawyer can have clients. He told me he was working on a great case that looked great. Are you sure it's not a small case with a very pretty figure? Well, the music definitely stopped, didn't it? The music? Too bad I didn't go on a little more ... just until ... - Until? - Until you said so. Louise, I feel like I know you or ... ... or having seen it somewhere before . Oh, I guess not. Oh, Maurice. Will you lend me a pad and pencil, please? Thank you. Why do women always want words? Well, words are like things you can keep in boxes, you know. Then you can take them out again and look at them. - Tony,... - Sr. Cavanaugh. Yes? - It's for you, sir. - Thank you. You forgive me? - Sure. Dear Brad, I think your old uncle is charming. Jo. Something funny? Well, in a way. Some kind of joke between Mrs. Ainsley and me. Mrs. Ainsley is the one who left. The pretty girl who greeted me. Do you think she's pretty? You do not? I have no idea. I didn't even notice her. I think she is very pretty. And also very charming. I was married to Jack Ainsley, my best friend. - What happened? - Died. Did she kill him? I do not see grace. Well, anyway ... It was in a hunting accident. I guess it left her very rich and very lonely. Actually yes. Let's just let it be, squaw. We're just good friends, that's all. It's okay, Brad. He never goes out with anyone except me. She is always very lonely. Well, she's very introverted. Before Jack died ... she asked me to take care of her. He even hinted that both of them ... eventually ... How do you know who said that? Jo told me. Please pass me the salt. What do you mean with that? It seems ... unbelievable how naive you men are! Goodnight. True Boy knows more about women than you. And who is True Boy? One of my grandfather's pigs. Pigs ?! Pigs are lovely. Thank you. They do not tell the one they want that they will end up marrying ... ... over time ... with another. And who did I tell I loved her? I guess you didn't invoke your Indian ... ... dead right now on the dance floor. I think it is my business how and when I communicate with my Indian! And it has nothing to do with declarations of love that I know of! Coyote! Let me tell you something! If that is how you talk to whoever you want, go to hell! Waiter. Yes sir? Hi. He left again. Yes sir. I saw it, sir. - It's okay? - Perfectly. I think I went overboard by telling her exactly what I thought of her. The funny thing about men is that ... The more ... ... you denigrate a woman, the more they praise her. I already realized that. They don't like scenes and tears; the fainting spells, the suicide threats, and the fuss. Those things turn my stomach. Me too. Yes, but she has all the time to see him and I only have the afternoons. How can you make a man fall in love seeing him only in the afternoons? What happened to the nights? Did they suppress them? No, but I can't go out at night. I have a job. And I have to replace Madame Zenobia ... ... while in bed ... with that dislocation. Look, if you think a man will be inspired by the moonlight, ... ...Try it. Take a night off. But how? Well, calculate what Madame Zenobia earns by working. I'll make it up to you. Do you think it's OK? Of course not! You will see how I fix everything. - Here's your coffee, Pop. - Thanks, Sam. There is a lady waiting to see Madame Zenobia, Toni. Voucher. Thanks bye. Hello, Madame Zenobia. I have been calling... ... and calling ... I wanted to ask you something. Thank you dear. I am in a frustrating situation. That's why I came to see her as soon as I could. I need your advice so bad. Well, tell me ... What happens? Do you have a sore throat? Oh I'm very sorry. But can you look into the crystal ball and answer me? Oh great. Well, Madame Zenobia, ... ... how to convince a man ... to make the decision to marry? Frankly, I don't achieve anything my way. I think he's interested in another girl. Oh, it's probably a cheap romance. I saw her. It's a scarecrow. Yes,... ...I'm sure. No more no less. Anyway, I don't like it and ... and I don't want to take chances. So tell me what to do. That I leave? Well I think it should be the last thing in the world that ... Go away! Make him miss her. Oh yeah. He takes me for sure, now that I think about it. Cry ... get mad ... ... desmáyese. Is that what it says? If that is not enough, threaten him ... with commit suicide. What weird advice! Yes, I know, but ... Well, you always advised me well until now. I will try it. It is incredible what moves men, ... ...truth? Hope the sore throat gets better . It happened to me too. Here's your money. And if this works, I will let you dance at my wedding. Goodbye. Well, this is your end, angel face! Any calls? Light man! What do you mean by that? Mrs. Ainsley called from the city where she is. I'm sorry I wasn't here. Did you leave a message? Of course not! Agree. Which was? Well, he was going to kill himself. Oh yeah, he told me to tell him that. And that... ... I also told him I was crying. But between us, he didn't cry. But why did Mrs. Ainsley say she was going to kill herself? Well ... she misses him. He also wants me to go to the country ... tonight, if not ... He is joking. Besides, I can't go to the country. I have a lot of work. I'll dictate you a letter, okay? Ahead. Dear Sir... Women! One committing suicide, another totally unbearable in the office, ... ... and the other the sea of ​​good. Dear Sir... Dear Sir... You already said that, Mr. Cavanaugh. Really? Read it to me, will you? Dear Sir ... Dear Sir ... Dear Sir ... - I did not say that. - Yes, you did, Mr. Cavanaugh. Don't be ridiculous. Why should I repeat "Dear Sir" three times? Well, I imagine for the same reason as when writing to Harper You asked for a dead Indian, Mr. Cavanaugh. And stop calling me Mr. Cavanaugh. Mr. Cavanaugh's office. Who is calling you, please? Miss Gerard? Belt. Where have you been? Why the heck do you keep fading so often? It's like going out with a smoke ring. Where are you? In the middle. Hey, if you don't have anything to do tonight, I think I can go out. Voucher. At eight o'clock? No. No, I think ... I'd better meet you there. It's okay. Goodbye. And what can I do for you, precious? A Mr. Bowman wants to see you, Mr. Cavanaugh. To tell you about Ms. Ainsley's property in Pell County. Yes? What happens. Let everyone pass. Come in, Mr. Bowman, come in. Sit here. Oh thanks. He seems to be very happy about something. I? No, I am happy by nature. I always am. I hope I don't make you bitter. No, he will not. Tell me, so are you ... ... interested ... in Pell County property ? If much. Tell me, how much do you offer for her, Mr. Cavanaugh? $ 60,000. 60,000! A week ago they asked for 40,000. That was before Mrs. Ainsley's option . Oh yes, it is. It was. Tell me, do you carry all of Mrs. Ainsley's investments? All. I see. And this one too? Of course. No one else advises Mrs. Ainsley on her ... ... investments, right? In no case? No. Well, look, Mr. Bowman, if you're interested ... ... that property, we'll discuss it another day ... ... at the price I told you. Otherwise, I'm afraid I'm a very busy man. Sit down, Mr. Cavanaugh. Sorry to be ... ... so nosy, but ... that's my job. You are a government attorney ... and I am a government investigator. And what are you investigating now? A usted, Sr. Cavanaugh. But, Your Honor, how do you accuse me of sabotage when ...? Of obstacles to the war effort, Mr. Cavanaugh, which is much the same. But even if he didn't know? You will have ample opportunity to defend yourself, Mr. Cavanaugh. Until then, he's free on $ 25,000 bail. Make sure everything is in order. - Yes sir. - Thank you. Excuse me, but I have to go back to my guests. Goodnight. Yes, I also had a date. Goodnight. Good night, Mrs. It's a lovely night, right? We'll see. Maitre d ', I think I'll wait at Mr. Cavanaugh's table. Of course. Oiga, master, ... ... I'm looking for the lady at Mr. Cavanaugh's table. Yes. His hat. - Are you expecting Mr. Cavanaugh, ma'am? -Yes. Yes. Keep an eye on my hat. I have a message for you from the boss. Yes. What is it, please? - That he can't come. - Thank you. Who can't come? Why not? He had to go to the field to see Mrs. Ains ... Listen! But why did he have to go? Why? Do you mean that you are here? But what difference does it make! Why did you have to go? Oh I do not know. Miss Mill, the chief's secretary, She told me that Mrs. Ainsley called her threatening to commit suicide if she didn't ... And you mean ... it worked? Yes. What worked? Oh, my God! What are you doing? Mire. It must have been my lipstick. I imagine. And this was my ice bomb. I'm so sorry ... that it fell. I guess you stumbled on this. Yes I think so. You are my pet, ma'am. My fatal wife. Brunner, en latin saying: "Out of many, one." In fact, the frozen bomb was not good. The meringue is somewhat dry. Why cry? He's fine. No harm was done. I do not cry. If it weren't for ... You see, this was my night off. But don't worry about it. Vale. Well, good night, Mr. Carter. Goodnight. I'll keep you posted on Mrs. Ainsley. Does not matter. I already know it. I'm going to dance at your wedding. Okay, maybe we'll meet there. Sorry sir. Can I have my hat? The gentleman's hat, please. Wait a moment! We don't take anything! Two silverware, $ 6. Okay, bring them to me, I'll eat them! But hey. But hey! I'm sure, and I can tell you. He didn't come around here tonight. I have to locate her. You see, I ... If you wish, I'll read the stripes on your hand. Nerd. I'm not looking for it for that reason. In that case, I can't help you. I see. Thank you. You don't know where you live, do you? I said if you don't know where you live. Oh, halfway between the world ... ... of the spirits and the city center. - It will be anywhere. - But, listen, ... I wouldn't be surprised if it came up suddenly. He does it often. I see. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. NOTICE - DO NOT GO TO THE FIELD SEE ACCIDENT! SEE TWO ACCIDENTS DO NOT GO - GREAT INDIAN CHIEF. He seems angry. He told me the fortune teller was not here. And it is not. And how did he write the message on my windshield? How do you know it was her? Well ... from what it says. Perhaps a spirit escaped or lost it. Do I give you a message? Yes. I better be here when I get back from Connecticut! Texas, he's going to Connecticut. I know. Thanks, Pop. Hey, watch out! NEXT TIME I TAKE THE TRAIN Caramba! I'm sorry Mr. She is amazing. He tried to warn me, you know. Who? Twice. I tell him that he cannot be opposed to the dead Indians. What did he say? Poor guy. Delirium Argue with Indians. Come on, give me a hand. LAWYER INVOLVED IN UNUSUAL ACCIDENTS Cavanaugh victim of two in a row Pop, look. Just there! I told him! Pop, I'm a clairvoyant. If he was right about that, he may be right about everything else as well. Pop, maybe they'll get married. I have to see him immediately. Come back here. Of course you will go see him. But first, eat your breakfast. Second, put on your best suit. And thirdly, don't let her ... ... take the best place! Jo, did Madame Zenobia tell you that the Government ... ... was involved, who wanted the land? No, he didn't tell me. He only said what I told you about oil. But I knew it. You must get someone's information. I wonder if what she says would exonerate me. Ask Biff to help me dress. Oh, Brad, don't dress in that broken. Ask Biff to come help me, please. Agree. Look who came, boss! Sweetie. ¡Toni! What did I do to you?! It's probably too soon after lunch. Oh yeah. Boy, if there's one thing I love, it's lively conversations like this. Jo, Miss Gerard. Toni, this is Mrs. Ainsley. Pleasure. I don't need to ask how he is. It looks very good. While you get dressed, Miss Gerard and I will wait outside, okay? Yes please. Don't go, Toni. Miss Gerard usually vanishes. It is a mania. While we wait outside, I'll see if I can heal her. It's my hobby, you know. Make lose all hobbies. Mr. Cavanaugh wants to get dressed, Biff. I can almost see the fang marks. What marks of fangs? Those of the Texan's throat. Give me my clothes. May I ask where we are going? Oh sorry, Toni. Come on ... let's see a fortune teller. Una A una pitonisa? Yes. A friend of Mrs. Ainsley. A certain Madame Zenobia. What a crazy name! Is it Egyptian? No. Madame Zenobia is anything to any man. To me he is a dead Indian. To Mrs. Ainsley she's a bloody traitor. But after all, Brad, he hasn't sabotaged any ships or anything. You've sabotaged me, haven't you? What did? Sabotage you? What do you mean? Those cheap tricks with the crystal ball! There is nothing worse in the world than abusing beliefs ... ... supernatural of people to earn money that ... It's like stealing from a church It certainly ... sounds awful. He is not at home. We should go, huh? No way! - Comes? - Sure. Listen! Is there someone? Nice place to play Post Office, right? I think there's another room back here. - Oh, there can't be! - Why not? I mean, there can't be two rooms ... ... like this all over the world, right? Let's take a look, huh? Hi there? Listen! It seems that he lives here. Yes, it seems that way, right? It overlooks the alley. What's the matter with you, Toni? I'm not feeling very well. The atmosphere here is suffocating, right? And it smells pretty bad. What can you expect ... knowing who lives here? Yes. What can you expect? Well, it doesn't seem to be home. Why don't we hang out at the shooting gallery next door? What happens? I think this is a good idea. You have no idea where it went? No. I haven't seen you since you ... ... was here last night. Maybe it's really gone. But can not be. All your things are here. Their suits and everything else. In the spirit world, I don't think he's going to need his suits much. Hi there! Who is your friend? Maybe the boy knows where he is. Who? Leonard? He knows nothing. One more brick and it's complete. I ... I'll be back in the evening. Thank you. Very well. Let's go girls. Why are you stepping on me? But she didn't know you worked for the government. What did? You tricked Miss Ainsley. Brad! But... But I helped her. So unless she is telling the truth ... But it will! Do not you think? Sure it will. But suppose he refuses, so what? Well, it's the end of the government career ... ... of the great jerk Cavanaugh, that's all. What happen? Oh my God! I forgot something! I have a very important appointment! ¡Toni! It's a real mania, right? To the center, please. I'll tell you where to go. - Oh jesus! - What happens to you now? I am unhinged! I completely forgot about a very important appointment. Wow, what is this all about ?! Well, some guys have it. And others don't. You don't have it. Keep insisting, brother. Put your arm around me. Wow, you are taller than I thought. Like most, I guess. And it also seems ready. Smart men scare me. No way! There is no need to fear them. For example, when I was here a while ago with those people, I had the feeling that you knew more than you said about ... Well, about many other things. You're afraid of your old man, right? I? I am not afraid of anyone. I do not know. I think if you asked him to shut up something, he wouldn't dare tell it. What do you bet? Show me how to hold the rifle. No way! I am not afraid to speak. But he said that you should get your information from some ... ... part and you just want to know from where. That is all. Let him look into the crystal ball, that's what I did. Sure. She has a little gnome locked in her and she tells me everything. Please stop the nonsense. This is very serious. Madame Zenobia, your entire career will be ... ruined. He cannot leave. You have to stay and tell him who you are. Oh my God! And that they give me what I deserve? No thanks. So won't it? Sorry, baby. I do not belong to the nobility. You see, I'm just normal people. Then I'll call the police. Get up! When you get to the phone ... ... around the corner, we'll be gone. You do not know? Then I'll call from here. No, you will not. And don't let her in there, Dusty. Stop her! - You can't stop me. - Agree. I hope you don't call the police. Listen! Let me out! Excuse me, I'm looking for Madame ... ... Zenobia. Guess with a crystal ball. You're kidding, right? That's not a real name, is it? Does not matter. Thank you. Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Great... What a weird place to go on a date! She's alone? It seems to be gone. You can speak? Or does your throat hurt again? No, it doesn't hurt. She was very generous in advising me. Now let me predict your future. I am very worried about you. You can't have it, you know? Because I can not? You heard what he thinks of the crawling fortune tellers, right? I do not care. What matters to me ... When the Government gets its hands on Madame Zenobia, and it will! He will confess that he advised me to buy that property. It will leave Brad exonerated. Of course they will exonerate him. But ... when they find out that you supplied Madame Zenobia, ... ... who prepared everything ... What do I have to do with it? And that all this time you and Brad have been together ... And that she is ... in love with him. Do you suppose for a moment that they think he wasn't into it? But they don't have to know that I worked for her. Nobody knows except Pop, and he won't tell. I know it. I see. As I already told you, my hobby is examining the abilities of others. Like yours from fading away. Like I've never done it before. All right, Mrs. Ainsley. I will go. And you keep flying after him. Here's your broom! Well, I guess that's it. I can't understand why you're running away, Miss Gerard. Why don't you tell Mr. Cavanaugh what you just told me? Oh, I couldn't. I haven't been very honest, Mr. Bowman, and ... ... if I told you ... All the things to pretend to be ... You see, if you ever knew the way I tricked you ... I just couldn't. I think I understand it. Thank you and goodbye. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Cavanaugh? I have to tell him this little by little. It seems that there were two Madame Zenobias. Exactly. I can imagine that. Okay,... Now you know. Come here. What do you really see in there? Any. And how did you know about the pellet marks? Well, looking ... Looking from where? You know, a vision. Of course I know what a vision is. I see you wherever I look. You know that? I see you sleeping, when I wake up ... Another little lie. Not well. Why... Because I'm in love with you, Toni. Really? ¡Oh, Biff! I saw Mr. Cavanaugh's car out there, did you catch that woman? Well, someone caught someone. Well! Let me in. You can't see the boss right now. Its busy. Occupied? With what?
