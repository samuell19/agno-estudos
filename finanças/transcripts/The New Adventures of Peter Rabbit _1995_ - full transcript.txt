SINGERS (OFFSCREEN): Oh, yeah! All right! (SINGING) Every bunny jump in a line. The sun is shining, and the weather's fine. We'll all have fun, and we'll never stop when we hippity, hippity hop, hop, hop. Every bunny, this is your chance. It's time to do our bunny dance. We'll hop through Mr. McGregor's grove when we hippity, hippity hop, hop, hop. Hop to the left and hop to the right. We'll hippity, hoppity, day and night. Hop, hop, hop 'til the day is through. That's what all of us bunnies do. Every bunny, all in a row. We'll hop wherever the bunnies go. We're hop, hop, hoppin' until we drop when we hippity, hippity hop, hop, hop. Hop to the left and hop to the right. We'll hippity hoppity day and night. Hop, hop, hop 'til the day is through. Well, that's what all of us bunnies do. Every bunny, all in a row. We'll hop wherever the bunnies go. We're hop, hop, hoppin' until we drop when we hippity, hippity, hippity, hippity, hippity, hippity, hop, hop, hop. -Yep. Guess I don't have to worry about rabbits with you around, do I? Heh, heh, heh. But if you see one, catch it, and I'll cook up some rabbit stew. -Meow! -On second thought, don't. -Meow? I'm not in the mood for rabbit stew. -Meow. -Actually, I don't much like rabbit stew. -Meow? -Matter of fact, I can't stand rabbit stew. Tastes like rabbit. -Meow. PETER'S MOTHER (OFFSCREEN): Peter? Peter Rabbit? Wherever you are, why aren't you here? I need you. -Uh-uh. Can't talk now, Mother. Uh, uh, uh. You said I could go see Benny in the city, 'member? And that's where I'm going. To the city. To see Benny. And I'm already late, late, late! -Let me see. A little bit of this, a lot of that. Maybe a little bit more of this, and, oh, my goodness. I never meant to add that. Hm. Cinnamon rhubarb mustard pie, with radish. Hm. Interesting. Where are you going, Peter? -To the city. -Hm. A little less of that, and a good two thirds more of this. Another radish for taste. Heavens! What for, Peter? -To see cousin Benny? -Let me just pinch in a dab, and a squeege of that. No, better make it a quart. My, no. Not now, Peter. Not at all now. You have to stay here and watch the girls. -Excuse me, Mother, but what did you say? -My. No, not now, Peter. Not at all now. -You have to stay here, Peter. -And watch the girls. -And don't try to weasel out of it. -Oh, but Mother, it's Flopsy's turn to watch 'em. -He's lying. -Am not. -When he says he isn't lying, it's a lie. -That's a lie! -When he says he isn't lying when he says he wasn't lying, he's lying. -You're lying! -That's a lie! -That's not true. -It certainly isn't. -Now, that's a lie. -You're a liar for calling her a liar. you liar. -Children, children, that's enough bickering. Peter knows the difference between the truth and a lie. -He should. He's told enough of 'em. -Now, Peter. You'll watch the girls because I must get to the store. I need radishes for my baking, and I must get going now. Yes, right away. If not sooner. -When will you be back? -Oh, I should say no longer than a spell, but not less than a stretch. It may take some time. It may take more. Possibly less. -That long? -Be good, now. Stay in the yard. Don't go anywhere near Mr. McGregor's garden. Remember, girls. Peter's in charge, so do as he says. I'll see you when I see you. Or thereabouts. -Is she really gone? -Oh, what did I do to deserve this? -Why, brother, dear, is that a fine attitude? -I would think he'd be delighted. -Well, I'm not. -What's the matter? Don't you love us? -We're gonna have so much fun! -Oh, how can I possibly have fun babysitting? -What was that about babysitting? -Benny? What? Babysitting? What makes you think I'm babysitting? You think I'd stand for that? Never a million billion years. -Then what kept you? I waited hours and hours, and you never showed up. -I, I, I, uh-- but Benny, no. I was coming tomorrow. -You were? Oh. Well, anyway, I've just come five miles, and I'm starving. What's there to eat around here? -Mother's gone to the store now. She should be back soon with-- -There's a nice garden over here. And I saw some awfully plump carrots when I was coming in. -Yeah, but I can't go-- I mean, I'm not supposed to-- well, sure. We could go over to the garden. I go over there all the time. -You do not! -I do, too. I just don't tell you about it. -Then come on. What are you waiting for? -Well, I have to watch-- I mean-- sure. OK. Let's go! -But Mother said-- -And she also said I'm in charge, right? -Right. -And she said you'd do what I say, right? -Right. -Right? -Right. -Right. I mean-- oh, just come on! -What did we do today, Mother? -Why, we watched Peter rob from Mr. McGregor's garden. -Yes. That's our brother's idea of babysitting. Teaching us how to steal. -Won't she be thrilled when she hears about this? -You can wait in here, where you won't get into any trouble. -I don't want to go in there. It looks just awful. And what-- what is all this writing on the top? -She can't even read. Can you believe it? Well, uh, that letter there is obviously, uh, q. And that one's a w, of course. So it clearly says, uh-- Zanzibar. -Who's Zanzibar? -It's not a who, it's a where. And it's all the way on the other side of the world. A good 40 or 50 miles from here. As you can see, Mr. McGregor is sending this package there by first class air mail. Now go ahead. Get in. -Oh! Peter, I'm stuck! -All right, Flopsy. All of you heave, and we'll ho. Heave! -Ho! -Ow! Oh! -Heave! -Ho! -Ow! Oh! Ow! -That sister of yours could stand to lose some weight. -Now, these carrots here are a little young. The tastiest ones are clear over there. -Could you give me a hand, Peter? -Breathe in, Benny. In, in, in. -Could you move over? -Who is standing on my foot? -I can't see a thing. -Will you get your elbow out of my mouth? -How's that? -I can't hear! Someone's head is in my ear! Where is he? -Can you see him? -No. -Step back! Let me look! -Will someone please get off of my foot? -(SINGING) Veggies. Veggies. I love to eat my veggies. Veggies, veggies, veggies, veggies, veggies. I get crazy over green and leafy vegetables. And a crunchy bunch of celery's exciting. I could eat a giant carrot, but I wouldn't want to share it. I get happy when a vegetable I'm biting. I get wacky over lettuce and arugula. And a crispy garden salad is a habit. I could eat a ripe tomato, I could nibble a potato. Well, I guess I'm just like any other rabbit. It's not because my veggies are good for me. And carrots help me see in the dark. Look at that! I don't eat meat or candy 'cause my veggies are so dandy. I would even eat the grass that's in the park. I go loco over leaves and cauliflower. And I'm goofy for some water crescent beats. And some beans and tender soya, that's a meal I enjoy-a. Oh, I'm nuts about what every bunny eats. I take a little nibble of this and that. I tippy-toe to eat what's above. I munch a bunch of crunchies 'cause my vegetable lunchies are so wonderful I think that I'm in love. I go loco over leaves and cauliflower. And I'm goofy for some water crescent beats. And some beans and tender soya, that's a meal I enjoy-a. Oh, I'm nuts about what every bunny eats. I love cabbages and cucumbers and turnips and asparagus and coriander leaves and nice zucchini. Oh, yum. And peas and corn and peppers, and kale and curly endive. And I hope that I don't turn into a greenie. I go bonkers for a radish, I go loony for a squash. I go nutty for a parsnip, I can't even wait to wash. I go kooky zany silly for a stock of brocco-lilly. Oh, the garden is a symphony of treats! I go nuts about what every bunny eats. Veggies, veggies, I love to eat my veggies. Veggies, veggies, veggies, veggies, veggies. -Do you see them yet? Let me look. It's my turn! Oh, my. Peter! -Peter, you sisters are calling you. -Peter! -They just want me to let 'em out. Watch this. I'll have some fun with 'em. -What is it? -Look out behind you! -Boy, what a cheap trick. -Look out for what? Bet you a buck she says a cat. -Cat! Mr. McGregor's cat! -They think I'm so dumb. -What? You will have to speak up! -Cat! Cat! Cat! C-A-T! Cat! -They want me to come running because McGregor's cat is behind us. What a riot! -Peter? -What did you say? -Peter? There's a cat behind us. -No. They just want us to think there is. [hissing] -Benny? -What? -Was that you? -No, Peter. -Then does that mean-- -There's a cat behind us! -Over here! In the bucket! BENNY (OFFSCREEN): I-I suppose it would have been too much for you to-- [gurgling] to have found an empty bucket? -Oh, no. [hissing] -Quick, Benny. Rock! I don't usually allow such things to happen. If I hadn't been so worried for your safety, I would have knocked the stuffing out of that cat! -Please, don't stop on my account. -Oh, no! [angry meowing] -Flopsy! Mopsy! Hopsy, Cottontail! Get out of there! Run! Run! Get out! Now! -Is that Peter? -What's he saying? -Yes, what's he yelling about? -Well, how would I know? I can't hear a thing with you talking. -Oh, no. Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no, oh, no! It's all the cat's fault, trapping us in here! If I get my hands on that animal! I'll teach him a lesson he'll never forget! -Well, go ahead, Peter. Kn-kn-knock the stuffing out of him. Teach him a lesson. -I would, but, but you see, I, well, I, uh-- Mother just cleaned this jacket, and she'd be awful mad if I got cat on it. Yikes! What's that? Do you smell that? -I don't smell any-- -Smells like fish, doesn't it? Yes. Definitely fish. Salmon, I believe. -Oh. Fresh salmon? -Meow! Meow. -Oh, yes. I'd forgotten. You're a cat. You don't have as keen a sense of smell as we rabbits do. Now, what's that? It's-- it's-- oh, yes. Tarragon butter, and a sprig of rosemary on the side. What was that? Sounded like Mr. McGregor. Yes! Calling the cat to dinner. -Meow! -Whoa! Come on, Benny! Oh, no. No! It can't be. They're gone! Benny, they're gone! -All the way to Zanzibar? -Oh, mother's gonna kill me-- kill them! The girls! She'll be very angry at them for disobeying me. So I have to do something. But what? What am I going to do? -Well, look at the bright side, Peter. -What bright side? -At least they're going first class. [groan] -Come on! We have to find them. For their sake, you understand? -Meow. Meow. Meow. -What's wrong with you, cat? Dinner's not for another three hours. -Meow? -Well, come back at 5:00, and you'll get your boiled potato. Same as always. -Meow! -Flopsy? Mopsy? Hopsy? Cottontail! Flopsy? Mopsy? Hopsy? Cottontail! Oh, I have to find them before Mother gets back. -Didn't you say you know where Zanzibar is? -I did? I mean, I did! I've said that because I do. I do know where it is. Zanzibar. Zanzibar. Sure. -Did I hear someone mention Zanzibar? -Who said that? -Oh, I did. Or at least, I hope it was me, otherwise someone's using my voice without my permission, which is a very unsettling thing to have happen. -Who are you? -Trevor T. Tittlemouse, attorney at law. My card. And you are? -Peter. Peter Rabbit. -No, no, no! Don't tell me! Your name is Peter Rabbit. Amazing! How do I do it, huh? I must be psychic. And in fact, I am. -I'm Benny. -I knew you were going to say that. It comes with being psychic. This is a very mystical power I have. A gift, it's true! And yet, sometimes a great burden, too. Pleased to meet you, Barney. -Benny. -You, too. My card. Trevor T. Tittlemouse, professor of entomology. That's the study of bugs, by the way. Now, why did I ask you here in the first place, huh? -You didn't ask us here. -Yet you come anyway! Uninvited, imposing on my hospitality and good nature. That's the last time I'll ever ask the two of you to drop by, I can tell you that much. -Oh, come on, Benny. Let's get to Zanzibar. -Ah-ha! So, now the truth comes out. This is really about Zanzibar, isn't it? -Yes, it is. Come on, Benny. Let's go. -One moment! I have a cousin in Zanzibar. But, uh, wouldn't it be faster to take the main highway? -Yes. That was my plan. I thought we'd switch over to it just up ahead. -Uh, there's a shortcut right over that way. -Can you show us? -Well, I should help so. I know that way like that back of my hand. Hm, that's not the back of my hand. I've never seen that before. What is it? -You'll show us, won't you? Please, you have to! -All right, all right. Just don't beg. I hate it when people beg. Well, I don't really hate it. Let's say I'm not particularly fond of it, but it's not bad. Makes for a nice change of pace every now and again. OK. Beg. You'll have to cross this creek, of course, because you need to be on the other side. It follows logically, you see? -Peter! In all the years I've known you, I never knew you could jump like that. -Neither did I! Well, but since I've only known you for five minutes, I have very little to compare it with. -All I did was job. -Uh, I, alas, will be unable to cross in a similar manner. -I will help you, but please, we really have to hurry! [clearing throat] -Being of the height which I am, wading will simply not be possible. And I cannot swim, because I've just had this fur dry cleaned. -Here. Ride on my shoulders. -Turtle, turtle, turtle! That's the trouble with snapping turtles. They snap. Now, you take the common box turtle. It's a much more docile little creature. -Please, we really are in a hurry. -Well, why didn't you say so? Come on, now. We head this way due west for a short while, then turn north. You see that mountain up there, the one with the craggy peak? We don't want to go that way. Still, it's a lovely place. Magnificent view. It's absolutely incredible. -Oh, doesn't that tree look familiar, Benny? -I suspect it's a common sort of tree. We've already passed three of them. -Well, here we are. -But we're right where we started. -I hardly think so. -We are. We're right here again. -Of course we're here. Where else would we be? If we were somewhere else, then who would be here? And this someone else who was someplace else wouldn't be us, and we wouldn't be we, now, would we? It only stands to reason. -I think we'd better ask someone else for directions. -Perhaps we should stop for lunch? It's only mid-morning. It's too early for lunch. -Peter, it's never too early for lunch. -Hold on, now, you two! I was gonna accompany you to Zanzibar, in case you've forgotten! -Meow! -Oh. Which one do we take? -I believe it's that way. If I'm not mistaken. -I say that one is the right road. Or at least, it's the road off to the right. And chances are the right road would be that right road. Or at least, the odds are 50/50. GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Excuse me? -Ah! -Are you lost? -Heavens No, my dear. We are here, just as we should be. Trevor T. Tittlemouse, dentist. My card. -We're going to Zanzibar to get his sisters, who got sent there in a box this morning after a cat-- well, I could go on forever. It's a long story. -Oh. Uh-huh. Well, wouldn't it be easier to just catch the mailman? -Well, of course. That's my plan. GIRL (OFFSCREEN): Is something wrong with your ear? -Huh? Oh. I, uh, I injured it. In a fight. Against three wolves. But you should have seen the wolves. And have you seen this mailman? -Mm-hm. He's on his way to the mail train. Down that road. -I knew the left road was the right road. -Oh, come on, Benny. If we hurry, we'll have them back before Mother gets home! -It's at least 20 miles from here! -It is? -Uh-huh. You could take the shortcut, though. Across the pasture and through the forest. -There's a rumor, you know, that the world is round. So I should imagine that if one were to look long enough, and hard enough, one might very well find oneself sooner or later. Or that, at least, is a theory of mine. -Oh. That smell smells very much like something I could eat! Berries. Berries and more berries! Oh! The choicest seem to be at the top. If I start at the bottom and work my way up, I may get too full before I reach the best to them. So I think I should start at the top and work my way down! Oh! -I beg your pardon? Uh, down here. Yeah. Yeah, it was me. Uh, I'm Tommy Brock. And you are? -I'm Benny. -No. No. You're a trespasser. That's my berry bush, you see? -I'm sorry. I didn't know. -Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I planted it from a seed. I did. -I apologize. If I'd known-- -But that's neither here nor there, is it? Because you are here, and you shouldn't be there. Several branches have been broken. Ah, the deed's been done. Now, we must determine a punishment. -We must what? -Perhaps you could come work for me. No salary, obviously, until you've paid off the debt. Yeah. Yeah. I think a year or two should do it, provided closer inspection does not reveal further structural damage, huh? -Uh-huh? Help! Somebody help me! -Benny! Where are you? -There! -Where did you come from? -Oh, no time. No time! We have to get out of here! Stampede! Cattle headed this way! Hundreds, thousands of them! -Where? Where? -Just over that hill! Now, hurry! Find high ground, or you'll be trampled for sure! -Yes! Yes, I must! Everyone, run for your lives! -How did you get up there? -Well, first I saw some berry-- well, how I got up hardly matters. Just get me down before the cows get here. Hurry, Peter, hurry! -Benny, there aren't any cows. -Well, of course there are. You said hundreds, thousands of them. I mean, how can you have a stampede without cows? You need lot-- oh. I see. Trick. -Wow. That was quite a jump, Peter Rabbit. -Did you think so. It was nothing, really. -Whoa! -I've never seen jumping like that before. -I have! -It wasn't such a big jump. I've jumped bigger ones. -Um-- perhaps you could discuss this later? We should go before that nasty little fellow realizes there are no cows. -You're right. And it's getting awfully late. This doesn't look so bad. -That's all well and good for you, Peter, but what about us? -I'm afraid he's right. -Have a problem? -Uh, no thank you, we already have one. -OK. -I'm trying to figure how to get them from down there to over there. -Oh. Only one way for them to be over there. -What's that? -They'd have to be born over there. -Yes, well, it's a little late for that, isn't it? -Oh, a lot of folks have tried getting over that wall. None have made it. -Hardly surprising. Keeping a body on one side and not the other is, after all, the purpose of a wall. If it did not function thusly, it would not be a wall. It would be a barn, or a toad, or something entirely different. -Would you happen to have any rope? -Uh-- uh-- let me see, now. Rope? Rope? Nope. Don't have any. Would twine do? -Yep. -Nope. Don't have any of that, either. What about a nice, long piece of real thick thread? -Oh, do you have any? -Nope. I was just curious. -If, as they say, you are what you eat, I believe this fellow's consumed one too many nuts. -Then i guess we're stuck. -'Course, there is a nice, thick patch of ivy vines over there. I suppose that might do in a pinch. Is this a pitch? -Oh, it certainly is. -Uh-- what are you going to do now? -Well, we'll push the rock over the far edge, and it'll pull 'em up. -All of 'em? I don't think that rock's big enough. -Hm. Maybe you're right. -Could you move over? -Move over where? -Whose arm is this? Oh. It's mine. -Are you ready? FLUFF (OFFSCREEN): Yes. BENNY (OFFSCREEN): Very ready. TREVOR (OFFSCREEN): Quite. Thank you. -Can you give me a hand? -A little crowded. Otherwise, a nice enough form of transportation. I've experienced worse. Such as once, I remember-- -Uh, you fellas suppose I could join you? Wherever you're going? I haven't been on a nice trips since, uh-- since-- well, I've never been on a nice trip. -Well, sure, if you want. [screaming] -Guess one rock would have done the job. -P-Peter? Are you scared? -Me? No. Are you kidding? CHIPMUNK (OFFSCREEN): Well, you should be. You have every right to be. -Who said that? -Me. You see, you have to be on your guard around there. There are any number of beasts in these woods who would be happy to feast on a group like yours. Listen, there's danger everywhere. Everywhere! Wait. What was that? Hah! Only my tail. Of course, these things can be dangerous, too. Couldn't tell you how many serious injuries have been caused by them. Hey, where are you going, anyway? -To the mail train, on the other side of the forest. -Oh, yes, there. I mean, that's a good place to be, because it isn't here. Of course, you should have a guide to get you through. Hey, how about me? I'd be happy to do it because, well, frankly, I can't take the stress of being alone here anymore. -That would be fine. -Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Safety in numbers, you know? Come along. -'Course, why should I worry about wild animals when I'm going to die of starvation at any moment? -No, is that all you think about? Honestly, nothing on your mind but breakfast, lunch, and dinner. -That's not true. Sometimes I think about dessert. -You know, it's been far too long since anything awful has happened. Far, far too long. Well, we're overdue. [growling] -Uh-huh. There. You see? Disaster. I knew we were due. -What is it, Peter? -N-n-now, now, there's n-n-no reason to be scared. -Hah! There's always reason to be scared. [growling] -And that's a fine one right there. [growling] -All right. Whoever you are, show yourself! We're not looking for trouble. There's no call for you to get aggressive. -What means this word, aggressive? -Uh, um, I, uh, mean. It means mean. -Ah. Then I am not mean. I am only lost. My name is Perkius Fasal Alshad Compaton. -Magnificent! So much name for so little animal. -Could we just call you Perky? -Oh. Yes, if you will show me how to get out of this woodedness, you may call me anything. -You could come with us. We're on our way to Zanzibar. -Oh, Zanzibar. It is on the road to my country. But, you see, I came here to visit, but I have become very-- how you say, house-sick? -How we say is homesick. -Oh. If I could join you, I would be eternally grateful. -Well, certainly. Of course. [coughing] -Hold on, now. Just one moment. Let us clarify one issue first. Are you the sort of kitten who eats mice the way cats do? Because what is a kitten, but a cat waiting to happen? -No. You are too-- what's your word? Scrawny. -Oh. That's good to hear. That's a definite load off my-- hey, who are you calling scrawny? My whole family's thin. It's my metabolism. Nothing I can do about it. You know, some would kill for a figure like this. -Oh, the food situation has gone from bad to worse, and all the way to positively horrible. There's nothing left of me. I'll need a new coat of fur soon. This one's two sizes too big. Ah. A nice bowl of steam. Needs salt. -Uh-uh. I'm worried. It's been several minutes since anything calamitous has happened. -What means this word, calamitous? -It means catastrophe, disaster, misfortune, tragedy, suffering, mishap. -That chipmunk's positively glum, don't you think? Very negative view of the universe. Clinically depressed, that's what I'd call him. -Oh. Ah! -If I don't find some real food soon, I'll dry out and blow away. Though I suppose that would require a small miracle. -Ah! -Ow, ow, ow, ow! Hot, hot, hot, boiling! -What a fat miracle. Well, hello there. -Hello. -Such a plump little fellow, aren't you? -Yes, well, I'm very sorry for dropping in uninvited. -Please, please, have a seat. Rest your feet. You look tired. -Yes. And hungry, too. -I don't believe we've ever met. Are you new to the forest? -Oh, I'm just here visiting. Perhaps you know my cousin, Peter? -No. Can't say that I do. But I'd love to eat him-- meet him. I have only a small circle of friends, such as Jeremiah Puddleduck and family. Maybe you know them? Lovely family. I had them for dinner just last month. -Oh, that smells wonderful. What are you having? -Baked rabbit. -Oh. I've never had it, but I try to keep an open mind when it comes to food. You know, I'll try anything once, yes sir. I-- I-- I-- um-- did you have any particular rabbit in mind? -Oh, just whatever rabbit happens to be convenient. -Oh, my! Help! Oh, help! Oh, somebody help! Help me! Somebody help me! Peter! Help! -Benny! Benny, where have you gotten off to now? BENNY (OFFSCREEN): Help! Please, help me! -You see? What did I tell ya? Danger is everywhere. Everywhere! -You know, I think that sound's coming from underground. From over there. -Oh, I'm getting tired. Let me eat you first. Then I'll have the strength to chase you. -No way. No way! -Hold it! Excuse me, sir, ah, but were you intending to eat this rabbit? -I was. -I see. Have you been inspected? -No, I, I don't believe so. -Is that bad? -Oh, it's not good. All rabbits, as I'm sure you know, must pass inspection to be certain they are fit to eat. -Well, yes, certainly. That makes sense, yes. -Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yes. Uh-huh. Well, looks healthy enough. Plenty of meat on these bones. -So I may eat him? -Well, of course. Oh. Assuming he's not over the weight limit. Do you weigh more than 15 pounds? -No! -Are you sure about that? -Well, all right. A little bit over. A smidgen. -Ah. Well, then, that's that. Sorry, old fellow. But laws are laws. -Oh, yes, well, indeed, indeed. I understand fully. Oh. I'll say, that was a close. Imagine, I almost ate a rabbit over the weight limit. -Bill. Bill. Bill. Bunny. Bunny. Bunny? What are you doing in there? That's no place for rabbits. You might get yourselves mailed somewhere. Now, you bunnies be careful. Steer clear of my cat. Mean-spirited fellow, I'm sorry to say. -What is taking Peter so long? -You don't really suppose he ran all the way to Zanzibar after that box? -No. Surely not. Not even Peter would be that dense. Would he? -Would he? -Would he? -He would. -I suppose we're gonna have to go get him. -Do we have to? -We have to. -Why do we have to? -Because we have to. -Are you sure we have to? -Yes. We have to. -Meow! Meow. -Hm. If there were such a thing as a rabbit inspector, it seems odd that another rabbit would do the inspecting. [gasp] Unless, of course, I've been had! -Grr. Cows? What cows? I don't see any cows. The stampede should be here by now. Unless, of course, I've been had! TREVOR (OFFSCREEN): So, we made it. And all in one piece, not that I ever expected us to. No, sir. Didn't think we had a prayer. -Look. We're there. Come on! Hurry, everyone! -I hope they're all right. -Oh, my. This is exciting. You know, I've never been involved in a venture that actually ended well. -And soon, I will be back in my homeland. -You know, I've enjoyed this little trip. l'll have to start getting out more often. -If we hurry, we'll be back in time for dinner. -Could you, oh, ow! Slow down just a-- ouch! Little bit? -Oh, no! It's leaving! No! Stop! Please don't go! Stop! No! No! -Oh, we were so close! -I knew things were going too well. -Oh. It'll be all right, Peter. -We'll just go on to Zanzibar to get them. -Well, sure. We can make it. -We made it this far, didn't we? -And we work quite well as a team. -You know how to get there, Peter. -Mm, just point us in the appropriate direction, and we'll get going right away. -But I can't, because I don't know. I have no idea where Zanzibar is. -What do you mean? -Of course you know where it is. -I don't. I don't even know if it's really where they're going. I made that all up. -You-- you what? -It-- it was a lie, I'm afraid. All of it. -Then-- then--- we came all this way for no good reason? -You misleaded us? -That wasn't a very nice thing to do. -Not nice at all. -I know. I'm sorry. -Well, I suppose there's little use in hanging around here. -Yeah. I'm better off back in the forest. Dangerous as it is. -Hold on, I'm coming with you. -And I, since it would seem I am not going back to my country. -I think I'll go home, too. -Me, too. -Wait! I'm sorry! I really am! -And we're supposed to believe that? -I am! I mean it! -Sure you do. -Expects us to fall for another one, does he? -He thinks we are lollipops. -You mean suckers. -I didn't tell any big lies. I never meant any harm by it. I wasn't trying to hurt anyone. They were just a few little white lies. MR. TODD (OFFSCREEN): So, the little gray rabbit tells little white lies. PORCUPINE (OFFSCREEN): A very bad habit, indeed. -Why, perhaps you've told lies about rabbit inspectors. -And cow stampedes? -Meow! -And salmon and tarragon butter, he says? -I, I, I only said those things to protect my friends. -Ah, yes. Your friends. -We ran into them on our way here. FLUFF (OFFSCREEN): Peter? Is that you? BENNY (OFFSCREEN): Could you give us a hand? TREVOR (OFFSCREEN): Awfully cramped in here! SQUIRREL (OFFSCREEN): You know, this isn't the most fun I've ever had. CHIPMUNK (OFFSCREEN): I knew something like this would happen. PERKY (OFFSCREEN): Someone in here needs a bath. -What are you doing with them? -Oh, just thought we'd take them back for a little celebratory dinner. -Perhaps you'd like to join them? Hm? -Meow. -I think you should let them go right now! -Oh, dear, dear, dear. I'm afraid we couldn't do that. -Shall we get him, Mr. Todd? -Yes. Let's. What? -Where'd he go? -I'm right here! -Ouch! -Watch where you're going. -Meow! -You watch out! -Make way! -One side! -He's over there! -Oh, now you've lost them all! -Me? It was your fault! -Never mind. It's not important. We have to get them back, since you lost them. -Let go. Let me go! -Okie dokie. -Get off of me! -Meow! Meow! -There! There! Now as if you didn't deserve it. -Stop this! Now! [shouting] -So were you. -And you. -Didn't think you had it in you. -I didn't think I had it in me, either. -Many congratulations. -Hey, perhaps for the sake of safety, we'd be better off sticking together. -Good idea. -Couldn't agree more. -I'm all for it. -And I, too. -Me also, myself as well. -I don't think you want to be around me. Not when I go home and tell my mother that my sisters are-- -Here. -Here. -Here. -And here. -Flopsy! Mopsy! Hopsy Cottontail! You're all right! -Of course we're all right. -We're always all right. Because we have the sense to stick together. [music playing] SINGERS: (SINGING) It's good, good, good to be together. Together? Together. Together! Together. Together.

It was you who let them get the best of us. -Meow! -It was your fault. -No, it was yours! -How so? -Well, it certainly wasn't my fault. PETER (OFFSCREEN): And the train was gone. The girls were fine all along, but the whole thing was my fault. -Well, what matters most, Peter, is that you're safe. All of you. Now then, let me make a nice supper. You must be starved after such an adventure. -Mother? Do you suppose I might ask a friend or two to join us? -Certainly, Peter. Certainly. -You know Benny, of course. -Oh, of course.

My card? -Yes, well, the more the merrier, I say. PETER (OFFSCREEN): Is it me, or is it a little crowded in here? FLUFF (OFFSCREEN): Maybe a little on the cozy side. BENNY (OFFSCREEN): Could you move over? I can't reach my fork. SQUIRREL (OFFSCREEN): I got an itch I can't scratch! PERKY (OFFSCREEN): I'll scratch your back if you'll scratch mine. TREVOR (OFFSCREEN): Ow! Someone's standing on my tail. MOPSY (OFFSCREEN): I think I'm gonna sneeze. HOPSY (OFFSCREEN): Oh, there isn't room. MOPSY (OFFSCREEN): Oh, no, my foot's asleep.
