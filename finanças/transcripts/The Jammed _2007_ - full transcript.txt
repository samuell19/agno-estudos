I'm sorry, Sunee, this is Tom. Sunee thinks her daughter might be caught up in prostitution anyway, she wrote this card and I figured that since you're the ex-posty you might be able to figure out where it was posted from. Nothing to tell. South, somewhere South, could nail it down to a few post offices. So how are you? Good, you? I'm okay. Seeing anyone? Gabi's trying to organize my life. Lucky you.

She's about 19 years old and I was-- I run a local business here. Look, I don't like your chances, she could be anywhere. Sunee, no one around here seems to have seen her. Look, I've really got to get back to the office. I stay. Maybe I've got an hour on Saturday morning? One already paid for you, so he's expecting you. I no work in a brothel!

My best friend is the police. And he'll send you to detention. Have you heard of detention in Australia? Have you? They stitch people's lips together so they'll starve? And then throw them on razor wire. They even lock Australians away in solitary so they go crazy and mad and shit. Do you think anyone here cares about girls like you? Look, I don't want no trouble. The girls come in, they go to Cross, they go on. Easy, understand? I come to dance on the table. Let's make this easy for both of us? No. Fuck! What the fuck did you think you were coming here to do?

Anyway, I know this little, I presume you like North African cuisine I mean you don't have any allergies, right? Ash? - Anyway, I'd love to meet up, my number is...

You need to contact the police. Please, no police. Well a private detective then, someone who can actually investigate and trail people, you know, someone who can hot-wire cars or open doors with credit cards. I don't even have a credit card.

Dunno, just found her in this parking lot. Do you know this woman? No! Tell me that you'll help her, right? - Bring her this way, mind the door... Where did you find her? Yeah, we met at a party, and I dunno, we went out for three, maybe four years, and I don't know what happened, just kinda fizzled. What about you? Gabi said you and, um. Tom. Tom, yeah, right. When did you guys? Hope she didn't put all my baggage on the washing line. No, just said you had to get out at least once a month. I'm sure she was kidding.

Which hospital? Hello, hello? Is someone in the hospital? I don't think so, no, um... Everything okay? Yeah, yeah, everything's fine. So, Gabi was saying that you're a Mechanical Engineer? I'm currently doing a study on magnesium alloys in engine blocks, some of the alloys they use are susceptible to corrosion, so I'm designing electrochemical tests for engine coolants. - Found her? Yeah, she's on Long Street, heading back towards our street. Long Street. Hey, pull over just here. My brother's an Engineer as well, it kind of runs in the family so family gatherings are a bit crazy, everyone talking about torques and tensions and tolerance. God, I'm sorry, Dennis, I have to go! Is everything okay? No, everything's fine, I just have to find someone. Well can I drive you somewhere or something? Ashley! Hello, beautiful! Shh. So where you been?

I'm sitting having dinner with your guy Dennis and I get this phone call from some girl with some foreign accent, Polish, or, anyway, she says that the girl in the poster is Rubi, okay, Rubi, that's Li Rong. And she works in a brothel. Ash, you shouldn't be getting messed up in this shit. I'm going to bed. No, Gabs, please, I saw the building. All you have to do is just sit in the car. I just want to knock on the door and ask which hospital Rubi's in. You know, for Christ's sake, why don't you tell this Sunee woman that it's not your problem anymore? Just come with me. Look, maybe this Rubi doesn't want her mother to find her. Does that ring any bells? Hey, no, look I'm, Ash I'm sorry, come on, come inside, please, promise me you will not go knocking on brothel doors. Now how did things go with Dennis? I think the lobster should go there. God, I just love that one, it's gorgeous. - Mrs. Glassman? Maybe we should move it over there, Arly. Um, Mrs. Glassman? Hello, gee, gosh you're early.
