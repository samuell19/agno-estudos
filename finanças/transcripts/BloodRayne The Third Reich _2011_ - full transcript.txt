BLOODRAYNE: THE THIRD REICH (2010) My mother, raped several times by my father, A monster who tried to rule the world... ....from the shadows. A monster I tracked through the darkness, and slaughtered. A monster who unwillingly passed his undead curse... to his daughter. I am the one who walks through the worlds... of the humans and the vampires. In the early half of my second century, the world allowed another monster to rise to power. A man who walked among the humans, but whose soul snaked amongst the demons. Fuelled by desperation and the rants of an ideologue, the man's power grew quickly into a force... that could not be contained. The man's dark soldiers spread across the continent, raping and murdering, butchering millions, while his evil mandate was carried out... .....with alarming precision. No talking. Pass when ready. Quickly. Move on. All right, let's go. Move it. Move it. Come on. Move, man, move. Let's go. Move it. And the Nazi scourge... spread its black tentacles out... to the corners of the continent. Ensnaring those that resisted, and using race and religion as a cause for murder. Even here, on the eastern front, at the edge of the apocalypse, the German army acts with impunity, believing their actions are without consequences, their debauchery without reproach. Even here they believe... they are safe to carry out their plans. They couldn't be more mistaken. Fucking Nazis. What is going on here? Why isn't this train moving? Where's your second? Agh. Agh. "Stop". Damn it. Agh. And who shall I say has the honor of besting me today? Honor? The last thing this is about is honor. My apologies, but the locals are finishing up outside, So lets just make this short and bloody. Agh. Agh. Ahhhhh. Aghhh... "Swords". Not likely. Don't cause trouble. Vasyl. I certainly would have remembered you... from the meetings. Nathaniel. You have already met my partners, Vasyl and Magda. I have never seen anyone move like you do. I bet you say that to all the girls. Curious thing is, I am not sure you are just a girl. Only the good half. You're her, aren't you? You're the Dhamphir. Their commandant? Shish ke-Bobbed. You did a pretty good job out here. This isn't our first train. Let's move. We have got boxcars full of weapons to unload. Where are the weapons? Stay calm. It's all right. There are many extermination camps... if these people are still here while the next troops come in, they're dead. Then we take them with us. Let's get moving. It's going to take us hours. To the forest, Then out through the pass before morning. Borne of violence, I have never known freedom from the darkness... ....that infects the weak. Part vampire, part human; a Dhamphir. My natural and magical abilities... allow me to withstand the elements... that eradicate vampire kind. I have walked the shadows of our world, mercilessly destroying the destroyers, as has been my calling. As has been my destiny. Will I never be free? I have never... I have never... who else has been on this train? No one. I need you to stay focused right now. Can you stay focused, soldier? Can I count on you to do as I say and stay clearheaded? I mean, he's sitting there And by all rights under the sky of god He should be dead-- Sir? Focus. Sir. Can I count on you? Sir. I need two more men, able bodied and tight-lipped. You have 5 minutes, soldier, and I suggest you use them. Sir. Are we eating? Tonight? The heat is fine. You can't rush beans and as I said, I refuse to burn your supper. Even when it's pigs blood? Yes-Yes-Yes-Yes-Yes. I mean you did get me blood, I don't mean to be ungrateful. Well, then it certainly comes effortlessly to you. Oh, a crack in the veneer. And here we were, Vasyl, worried our Dhamphir. Would be just a humorless killing machine. How many trains, do you figure? As many as they feel are necessary. I have heard they have completely emptied some of the ghettos. Do you know the odds are against us, Nathaniel, that the Germans get stronger while we dwindle away? We're losing. While we're out here being picked off Like rats in cage. Well, that's a particularly cheerful thought. I keep thinking about the people on the train. Who we saved. And what about the next one and the one after that? It never ends. We do what we can, it's as simple as that. The rest you have to let it go. I have never been the one to "let things go". No, you certainly haven't. My sauce is getting hot. Is our Dhamphir not staying? "I have lost my appetite." Right. Apparently I burned the blood. Shit. Get out. This is an honor. Your camp is too dark. Slovakian generators, or some such nonsense. I trust you received my communique? Of course, Silly man. Just a moment. The doctor is in his lab. Doctor? Oh my god. I certainly hope not. There are a plethora of useless deities... to worship, lieutenant, if you're so inclined. This is certainly not one of them. Is that a vampire? Indeed. Our night patrol caught it scrounging... near the west fence a couple of nights ago. Unprecedented happenstance. I believe it was a gypsy at one time, but who's to say? I have never seen one. Which is why you're alive. These creatures no longer have any bonds... to the moral laws of man, Which is why you never trust a vampire. Must you savage him in my presence? "It", lieutenant. "It". I am just testing its resiliency. And let me tell you something. I believe, this creature, is one resilient specimen. Outside. Now. I will be back. I have no authority in these matters, but I won't stand idly by while you kill that, creature, as part of some mandated experiment of yours, doctor. The fascinating caveat, lieutenant, is that they are very difficult to kill. Only by stake, fire, sunlight, or holy water. The vampire will stay responsive forever. It's a marvel of science. I am on the cusp of great discoveries... in the avenues of longevity. Discoveries whose application... will contribute to the betterment of the reich, to the leaders of the reich. You see, I believe I can make Hitler immortal. There's been an incident. Pack a travel bag, we leave in twenty minutes. I am sorry my work here needs me to persevere. I have try... My dear boy. What have you found? Twenty minutes. Well, it is done. Now we wait. "We wait?" Need resolve, doctor. What can I tell you? It's a science, I don't understand... That's what I can tell you. I need to know how that man... a man I have worked with for three years, I will add. How that man could have been impaled straight through... and still be alive. He's now a vampire. I know he's a vampire. Then you understand that although it's badly injured, it will eventually heal from having the bar removed. I would suggest before that happens... you have it in restraints. Or cut it's head off. Or both. I don't understand. He's vampire, lieutenant. Nosferatu. I am rather shocked a lieutenant in the Fuhrer's army... is having a difficult time understanding this basic fact. He's been infected, and the quicker you say goodbye to your old friend... and dispose of it... the safer you and your men will be. It will be up and moving sooner than later. Now I came here... I put myself out to come here on the premise... that you had found something extraordinary. Extraordinary, lieutenant. Now whoever that was in its previous life... is now a common vampire. And that in itself is not extraordinary. Needless to say, I expect a car, immediately. Doctor. The assault on the train... it happened in daylight. Let me ask you a question, lieutenant. This creature that ravaged your men at the train, Did it move like a vampire? Well, I didn't see her... I wasn't there, but yes, from all accounts. They left two men alive, alive long enough to give us the information we have. This creature perplexes me. I suggest we focus on the more pressing matter. But don't you see? They're linked. If this daywalker sired our commandant, there is a greater likelihood he shares... some of its capabilities. This will carry my research ahead tenfold. I don't care about your research, doctor. I am going in. Caution, above all. The creature has had more than enough time... to regain its strength. My studies indicate they become instinctually aggressive. You expect that to work? I have no idea what will work. Into the breach. I have no idea. Commander? I can help you with your transition. You are a magician, Ninoslava. Help me. I will be right back. Stay here. I was relaxed. Get out. Enjoying my massage. I said get the hell out of my room. You mean hers, don't you? You're just a Nazi tourist. You filthy cunts, you never listen. Agh. I can't punish you for the legions of women Who have been brutalized by men, But I will give it my best shot. Let's go. You will want to lock that door. Go, shut the front door, we're closing early today. Go. But the Germans will know something has happened. You will listen when I ask you to do something. Your aggressive encounter... had better not be problematic for me. Pleasant. Checkmate. Enough. You told me, you assured me, that you, would help me heal. You gave me your assurances. It's unknown. I only know what I have learned. Look at me. Look at me. We have to make a decision. We will take action, If and when I authorize it. If and when I authorize it. Yes sir. No, no, no, I got a present for you. I already had my massage. This is a thank you for what you did... ....to the soldier. This is on the house. Thank you. Have fun. Hold on. I have information herr commandant needs. Really? All right, follow me... and keep your hands in view at all times. Well, what is it? The whore from the bordello, sir. Well, spit it out, girl. This information is for the commandant himself. I will decide what information passes to the commandant. I am sorry to have bothered you. Unless you're prepared to be shot... in the back of the head by my friend I'd stop. Good. I may have under estimated your value. I am sure the commandant will be quite eager... to hear what you have to say. And what would you want for this do doubt... highly classified, top-Secret information? At the bordello, there is a woman I work for. And I hate her. I want to run the business. I want her to go away. Ah... ....a little cock sucking entrepreneur. You only get one kick at the can in this life. Oh yeah, right there. Yeah, right there. Oh yeah. Is the commandant not all right? I am more than all right. Your commandant is merely going through... ....a metamorphosis of late. A transitional phase. To what do I owe the pleasure of your... the pleasure of your visit, my dear girl? Herr commandant, I have news of the woman you seek. I seek many women, my child. There's talk of an attack at the rail depot yesterday, and now the German soldier... I know she's of interest. Soldier? At the bordello, where I work. I see. He nearly raped a masseuse, and this woman hurt him. Did she? Yes. Quite badly. The worst, really. I see. And you know where I can find this woman now? She's still at the bordello, mein commandant. This is very good news. You, look so young... and smell so sweet. I can feel the blood moving through your vein. Faster... faster... ..please. My child there is one more thing you can do to help me. I need you to help me heal. Agh... Yeah. So, we meet again, my dear girl. Or would it be more accurate to say, dear mother. Agh. Stop. Stop. Stop. - Stop. - She must not die. We need her alive. I think we got her. Inside. I have got it. Good. What is that? The commandant drained you an hour ago. An hour, gypsy. Yes, remarkable healing ability. I feel... different... stronger... Oh, imagine how powerful you'd feel... if you were impervious to this. A simple test. You have inherited his immunity, however slight. If you were a regular vampire, the holy water would have crushed your hand... like paper-mache. But imagine if holy water had absolutely no effect, Or fire, or wooden stake. Imagine the possibilities. Your blood nourished the commandant, Helped him with his healing. A necessary exchange. We must all make sacrifices to benefit the Fuhrer. Times they are a-Changing gypsy. Why just yesterday I thought the daywalker was a myth, A figment of scientific conjuncture. But today as they say... ...The world is our oyster. Change is inevitable. Evolution, inevitable. The fatherland, inevitable. Rook takes knight. What are you up to, herr doctor? Doctor? Doctor? I can't help myself, doctor... it's the devil in me. It's curious to me, this change you have endured. I have studied it, But I don't comprehend the science. What if it's not science? What if it's something bigger than science. Science is everything. Am I still your favourite subject? You are certainly the most verbose. You have jettisoned your human foibles, your mortal coil, as Shakespeare called it. He sounds like a smart man. You have managed to somehow both evolve... and regress at the same time. You're confusing to me, I like it. On the other hand, You have become subservient to your primordial instincts. What are those? Hunger, thirst, bloodlust, sexual urge. With my new life, you have observed three... of the four. Are you a gambling man, doctor? It appears that I am. Turn it. I know, you're dying to see... what I am capable of, doctor. Don't be a fool. Agh. Ahhhhh. Events became unruly. Yeah, so it seems. Compose yourself, join me upstairs. It's a fool's errand. I need grenades. I was sure that you guys had grenades. It's a fool's errand and you will only get yourself killed. Okay forget the grenades, I... I can use dynamite. Where is the dynamite? Rayne, you don't know what you're doing? Rayne, stop. You're not getting dynamite. I am going home, to sharpen my knives. You can't rush into a hornets' nest... when your only strategy is to cut off heads. I created him, Nathaniel. Believe me when I have never sired another... I will not start with a Nazi. You don't know whether you're responsible. When I left him, he was a kraut-kebob. This morning he went to the bordello to cause an assault to find me. I drained him. My blood must have mixed with his. There is no doubt in my mind... that I am responsible and now I need to do What needs to get done. He ends tonight. Listen, I am the first one to jump into a tempest, But this is different. He's not just a vampire, Rayne, now he's a vampire... with an entire German army behind him. Now despite how you did things in the past, We need to work together. Working with a team usually means the team dies. Then that's our decision to make. Nazi dogs. We have scouts watching their movements as we speak. We will have something shortly. We will handle this. Nathaniel I need you to understand something, I need your men to understand, That I have spent my whole life hunting down the undead, And I promise you... that it's about to get seriously fucking complicated. Good. I was sick of killing just Nazis. An undead will fire things up around here. Be careful what you wish for. Magda will be in position soon. And what're you two up to? Efforts toward the greater good. And who's Magda? I know you missed me. Have you been waiting a long time? Are you afraid I stole some tissues? Come come, be a good girl. Does he really have to feel me up every time I need to pee? These are trying months, dear. My associate wants me to enjoy my evening... with you as much as I do, but there are some unsavory elements lurking about. Elements who might hide a weapon in that toilet. Elements who would kill the pair of us... because of the clothes on our skin. And clothes, rarely make a man. Am I right? Huh? Bartender. More drinks. We're celebrating. On the house. Drop it. Now. I suppose two thoughts are vying... for your attention right now. One, "how is my night going to end?" And two, "where exactly did she have that gun?" Lachaim. During the day, we have a business to run. You understand. Now, we would very much like to talk to you.... About these codes. So she's a code breaker? She's one of the best I have ever seen. Have you heard of the German's enigma machine? Should I have? Not unless you're in the communications business. She cracked an enigma code, which means nothing unless you follow that sort of thing. But at any given minute, Magda knows the where, the when, and the how. Looks like you have got things tied up. I have to go. Looks like we both have somewhere to be. See you around, Rayne. Yeah. Agh. Agh. Nathaniel. Nathaniel. Nathaniel? Nathaniel? Agh. Aghhhhh. Agh. Help me to change the world. Don't I have to invite you in? I don't believe it works that way, lieutenant. Drink? I don't have the thirst for it I once had, lieutenant. Now what can I do for you, mein commandant? As you know, recent events have re-directed... my efforts in this war. What once was is no longer. We are now able to bring a new arsenal of skills... to our strategies. Strategies that we need to mobilize... for the difficult road ahead. And how am I able to better assist the cause? Your tracking skills, lieutenant, are unsurpassed. I have witnessed fantastic results... from you over the years. Not to sound abrupt, sir, But what is it about my abilities, tracking or otherwise, that lends itself to a visit in the middle of the night? Lieutenant, You can be so much more. Never. Agh. Christ. Don't you know not to sneak around a Dhamphir's lair? Okay. How did you know I was here? Don't have to be a blood-hound to find you. I can't get warm. That will pass. Is it done? In a few minutes, we will be one, the lieutenant and I. Can he be trusted? Now more than ever. This is the Dhamphir's scent, lieutenant. Find her, tonight. Alive. Fascinating transformation. Heil Hitler. That was quite a cold-Hearted execution back there. I didn't know you had that in you. Yes. He put himself in that situation... as soon as he donned jackboots and fell into rank and file. "Donned"? Yes, donned. I am considerably older than you, Nathaniel. Yes, but still... donned... what are you doing? Who's that? It's Vasyl, one of our men. You invited Vasyl here to my hideout? He misses you. I am surprised your kind has survived this long. As long as you are here, I think we have a major problem. Stay there. I believe the commandant is bringing... ....his freak show to Berlin. To create an army. An undead army run by the man himself. They will be lucky to make it to Berlin. we can't just rely on luck itself. What's your plan? We have got company. Dhamphir. What have you done to us? To me? What have you done? What am I? Nathaniel, get out of here. Agh. Agh. Hey Vasyl. Stop it. We need him in less pieces. Speak if you can. They wanted me to find you, to find all of you. He fed on me. The commandant? He was my friend... why would he take your blood... when he has trains full of victims... if he wanted that? I am the tracker. How many has he turned? - I followed him... - How many? Where did you follow him from? From the whore. His smell was on the whore's clothing. To the code-breaker, and now to you Dhamphir. Magda. Magda. You fucking murdering bastards. Hold it. We won't get anything else from him... if he's dead. "If" he dies? If they have got Magda, they have got everything, Rayne. They have got allied troop positions, They have got fucking safe house addresses, They have got fucking agent names. Let me ask you something, How're you going to make it to Berlin... if I cut off your head? Where did they take her? Nowhere yet, But they will be sending her... where they are shipping all of the rest of them. Go. The tavern. Send the alert. Is that everything? Yeah. Agh. This is when the day gets ugly. Agh. Stop. Magda. Ha. Fall back. Fall back. Who's there? Let's get this over with Nazi filth. I have been rather philosophical lately. I have been thinking about great artists... like Wagner, or Bach, Or, maybe the man who designed the church for this town. These great artists, they tricked the gods into granting them immortality. They tricked the gods. Immortality, that elusive hare that outwits us all. But in two hundred years, I might return to this town and to gaze upon that church, because I am now immortal, code-breaker. I, am now the trick personified, that has been played on the gods. Is this supposed to scare me? Agh. This shouldn't have happened. We let our guard down. We should have fucking had her. We missed her, Nathaniel. It happens in war. People die. Don't you lecture me on the price of this war... and on human lives, vampire. And do not you lecture me on undead vermin... that I have hunted all my life. Emotions run high, and they should. But unless the lieutenant was playing games, I suggest we get to the rail depot... before the train leaves with your Magda... and those Nazi fucks gain more ground. The three of us and six men? We have one shot at this, you know. Then let's make it unforgettable. How many have I cut down? How many of the unholy have I slaughtered? I have stained the centuries with their blood. Now the creatures of the dark have emerged... from the shadows, Now they walk among us, And take their victims on a whim... Magda. The innocent are pulled into the dark abyss... by the wretched, and the cycle of bloodshed continues through the ages. When will we finally comprehend our inhumanity? As we gaze across our battlefields, flush with corpses and heavy with the spoils of war, Can we ever hope to realize that which we have lost? The unholy lurch through the countryside... in search of their prey. Perhaps our salvation, our peace, lies only in bloodshed. For it is all they have ever know. It is all that I have ever known. I am the hunter. Agh. Stemper? Agh. There is no train. There must be something going on inside. Magda. Thank god. Stop. Come with me. I feel so much stronger now. It isn't human. Come with me. It's me... Magda. Kill her. Kill her. There's nobody else. Is there anything there? End-To-End and back again. That doesn't make any sense. Why post guards on an empty factory? Unless... Magda wasn't the only vampire created. Nathaniel. Aghhh. Shoot the window. Shoot the window. Such a prize. Bind her limbs. Take her to my laboratory. And you my dear boy. What shall I do with you? Come on, hurry. Get that stuff up here. Move, move. Be sure you're following the road. Okay. Okay. Come on, faster. Hey, carefully. Okay. I have decided to take you with me to Berlin. Maybe I will get your picture in the paper. "Leader of the resistance, hanged". Don't worry, we have an abundance of information... about where your forces have gathered. We will travel unfettered. We may even get lucky, And the Fuhrer shall see you hanged. You, are an amazing specimen. A true discovery. I have drained you for almost an hour. You produce blood as fast as I extract it. Alexander Fleming had his penicillium fungi, I have this. Soon, I will infuse our Fuhrer with your blood. Then we will see what we get. I doubt it will help his small dick complex. I will not let you mock my efforts. I have all I need from you. Even a Dhamphir cannot survive a beheading. No no no... I will keep you for exhibit. Untie me, if you really want to dance. Agh. Some other time Dhamphir. For now, I am content with only dinner. My god. Such power... Strength... I am going to enjoy killing you immensely. Doctor. I want her agreeable for travelling. It's time to meet Hitler, Dhamphir. There's just ten of us now. Unfortunately, we have got only one of these. If they reach the pass, they reach Berlin. But that means more Nazi's and Hitler himself. Beyond the ridge and down the second peak. We cut them off before the pass. The dynamite is planted? Where will your best shot be from Natalia? I will be right there. It is high ground, well concealed, I will get a perfect view. It will be a great shot. Then we detonate from over there. Let's go, good luck. Agh. Go, go, go. You okay? Yeah. Agh. Agh. Wait. What are you doing? No. No-No-No-No, that is for the Fuhrer. Heil Hitler. Oh no. See you in Berlin. Agh. Ha. Agh. Aghhhhh. You Bolshevik swine. Agh. Ahghh. I am the prodigal son of the third reich. I am power incarnate. Agh. Motherfucker. It... It will be all right I am... I am fine. Let's get him in the truck. It's done. We have got more work to do. What is it? Sir, it's a truck. I see for myself. Go open it. Guten tag, motherfuckers.
