Excuse me... ... can you help me? l'm looking for my brother... ... but l have no idea where l am. Please help me. No, thank you. l need to get to Bukit Merah... ... can you show me how to get there? My name is Ayu. ''Hello'' l'm Mahsuri. Oh... you're Siamese. Let's see... ... how do l do this. There's a hill... ... it's red. Nenek Kebayan... Potion of Eternal Youth? Huh? Youth? Not quite... he's still a young boy. Little... kid. A little young boy. Look for the... ... Forest Market. Mahsuri! Mahsuri! Don't die. Dayang! Who are you?! Oh, dear... ... l've got the wrong person again. This isn't Dayang. Of course she's not Dayang, she's Mahsuri! Take a deep breath... ... don't die on me. But Dayang has married to another man. l will look for her until l find her. That way! Hello! Hello! That's going on? l don't understand. Do you want to marry me, huh? l want to make Dayang jealous. How about it? Cool? Are you crazy! Hey! What are you two up to? Oh, no! lt's the police! Not so brave now, huh? Get down. Awang! Let's get him. What's wrong with you? You're always causing trouble. He's crazy! Just now, he speared a girl up there... Don't believe her, Tuah. She's lying... l was just practising. Yeah, right. Are you nuts? If the spear hits the body... you could really hurt someone! Don't touch me! What were you thinking? Carrying this spear around with you everywhere. It is an offence to bring it to public places. This is homicide. You could be hung for this. So what do you want to do now? Do you want to settle this issue or not? Relax now. Keep it low. Who's this young lady? Sir, l just need a little help. That is it? l have to look for my brother. l'm lost. Mahsuri had said that... ... she saw my brother at the Forest Market. Forest Market? Nevermind... here's the plan. Kasturi, Lekir... you go get Mahsuri... ... and do the neccessary. Lekiu, Jebat... ... take Awang to see Puteri Gunung Ledang. What about you? Me? What else? l will take this lovely young lady... ... to the Forest Market... . . to look for her brother. But Hang Kasturi, Lekir, Tuah, Lekiu, Jebat... ... aren't you all from Melaka? So why are you talking with a northern dialect? Of course we're originally from Melaka... ... but we speak this way for a reason. Let me explain. We've been meditating in a cave up north... ... for a very long time. Meeting northern girls... ... eating northern food. Not only northern food... ... there were also a lot of other things. There were many different... There he goes again... I think you are one of the human beings... ... lost in my world, Magika. Do you know anything about Nenek Kebayan? She's actually a kind person at heart. She helps a lot of people. She sells her potions... ... and then throws a feast for all the people. Then why would she kidnap my brother? Because... A fly. lt's disgusting. Maybe she was trying to help a lost person. Furthermore, Nenek Kebayan likes children. There used to be a lot of children here, but not anymore. Why? That's the thing. Because when Nenek Kebayan raise all those childrens ... but once the grew up, they all left this place. They got out? Please... don't touch me. However, if you do it later tonight I won't mind. There actually seven portals out of Magika... ... but the nearest one is at "The Gateway Cave" Tuah, why don't we look for my brother first... ... and then you can take us to the cave. l'm sorry. l don't dare to go there. l have never been there. I only heard these stories from other people. Legend has it that there is... Dogs! Run! Dogs? This is so embarrassing. Let's see if this works. Help! Help! l've got to get up there. You're no match for me. l'm the great Hang Tuah. See my trusty dagger. It's impossible for a great warrior like me... ... to feel fear or be defeated. Help! Help! Help! I thought I caught a deer, but a human. Get up! Where am l?! This is my trap. Go! Don't ever mess with my trap ever again! Thank you. l'm Ayu. What's your name? Bad. You're human, right? How did you get here? Of course I'm a human... can't be a genie, can l? Don't try to be funny with me. Bad... Bad, actually, l have a problem. I... My brother is lost. I search for him everywhere... l don't know where I'm going now. I don't even know how to get back. Please, help me Bad. Where has your brother gone to? This one old man said he was kidnapped by Nenek Kebayan. Nenek Kebayan? Bad, what's wrong? Bad help me, please. l don't have anyone else to help me. There's someone said, they saw him in a Forest Market... Go find someone else... I've got my own problems. Bad, do you know, you're the only normal guy around here. You look, you look like someone who l can trust. The others here are so weird. Have you no pity on me, Bad? Bad, please help me. Sorry! You're so hard headed. Bad! Sit, sit there. Excuse us now, Murad. Be strong. Ma'am, we'll continue tomorrow. Excuse us, we're going now. How was it Murad? Have you heard any news? Not yet, mother. The villagers are still searching. I don't know what has happened to them. Be patient, son. What is it with you and the dogs?! Lucky, Bad were here. If not...? Bad you're strong... please help Ayu save my brother, Bad. Enough of that.

All you do is cry... ... well keep crying then. The more you're crying the more potion I can make. Do you know! Let me go. You're crazy. Hey old woman, let me go. I want to go back to my Grandma's house. You dare call me an old woman? l'm still young. l'm only 300 years old! Look at my body. As firm and shapely as before. l'm forever young and attractive. Even your mother doesn't look as young as I do. What's wrong with you? ls your mother fat and unattractive? Don't you talk about her. She's passed away. Oh, you poor little boy. So you're an orphan? Keep on crying... ... that's it! The more you cry, the better it is for my business. Must be the onions you ordered to make him cry more. The door opened by itself. But there's no one here. Hi Awang... Want onions? Who's that? Help me! Who's that? - New kid? - Mind your own business! ls this all you have? Here, take this... ... and have a look yourself. We only sell big onions... ... not small ones. Say whatever you want... ... size is not everything. You think too much of yourself. Thank you, see you again! Come one, come all. I have all kinds of ointments and oil for sale. So this is the Forest Market. Seems like Nenek Kebayan's stall is all sold out fast. Her new stock sold very well. There were many customers here earlier. Just perfect for me. This virgin, is she yours, Bad? Have you seen my brother? He's quite small. - This small? - Yes, that small. Have you seen him? It's small in the old days but now it already big. - In the bushes, where? - Let me show you. Where is my brother? Come with me, my dear. He's always interfering. Bad, he saw my brother. Don't fool around. lf not her, then you'll do. He's crazy. Let's go. Yes, doctor. l understand the risk. But, aren't there any other donors? Take my kidneys instead. l am sorry, En. Murad. For now, only Puan Khatijah is suitable as a donor. But Doctor, my wife is not that healthy... ... so of course the risk would be high, right? Every operation has it's own risks. We will try our best... ... and hope for God's blessing. lja, are you sure about this? Why don't we wait another week or two? How long more do you want to wait? I can't bear looking at Malik like that. Furthermore, this is my own decision. How much further? No... ... you don't have to worry. I will help you until we find your brother. Okay. Bad, do you have a family? They're nearby. I always visit them but they're long gone. Bad, what happened? Are you okay? lt's just a small cut. Come here. Let me see that. Come on. Hey... ... l'm a strong guy. But that doesn't mean you're impenetrable. Let me have a look. This looks bad. You hexing me?! Are you a witch?! Bad, what are you talking about? l'm fine. You have a seat. You have to get to a clinic. What's a clinic? A clinic is where sick people are treated. Didn't you learn that in school, Bad? What's a school? A school is where people learn things. Learn to read and write. Bad, can you read and write? No? Come here. A-Y-U... ... Ayu. This is your name. B-A-D... ... Bad. You can write sounds. Clever. Oh, dear! What's wrong? Just like a couple in love... ... writing our names on the ground like this. Yes? What is love? Well... Love is when two people... ... a man and a woman... ... like each other. You're a handsome man... ... surely you've been in love before. What's handsome? Bad, you're so full of questions. Handsome? Handsome means... ... somebody who is attractive. lf that's the case... ... Ayu, you're handsome too. No Bad. That's wrong. You can't call Ayu handsome.

We'll be safe there. Tomorrow, we look for the way out. Okay, Bad. Come. Let's go. Okay, Bad. Just like a Hindi movie. - Shut up. - That's painful! Cheeky! Wow! Malik, wait up! What's that stench? lt smells like vomit. Don't be rude. This is his home. Can't you smell it? Have a seat. Sit down and be quiet. Don't do that. But it stinks. Want some? Bad, how do we get out of this place? It's through "The Gateway Cave", isn't it? How do you know that? Someone told me. But... . There are dogs? What dogs? lf not, what then? There's a guardian. A guardian? What's that? It protects the gateway out of this world. Oh, a security guard? Not an ordinary guard... A dragon? So, what should we do now? l don't know. l've never been there myself. But legend has it that... ... it will attack anything that passes that place. Attacked? ''Chini Lake''. ''Chini Lake''? But that's so far away! We can't walk there. lt's impossible. Our worlds are very different. Here in Magika... lmagination? Tell me more about the dragon. ls it a good or evil dragon? According to folklore... ... the Seri Gumum Dragon... ... nevermind. We'll soon see for ourselves. There's no other way out anyway. You go on to sleep. We'll leave tomorrow morning. Where are you going? l'll stand guard downstairs. Good night.

You just have to believe in it, Ayu. Always together through thick and thin. Let's go. Wait. Where's the dragon you told us about? l haven't seen it. l don't know. Maybe it is still in hiding.
