[funky music] [scat singing] [siren wailing] - Let's see, the weirdest case? That's easy. Now that's after 30 years on the force, and there ain't shit I ain't seen. The case of the missing homeboy and the dead designer queen. Two dudes stuck in the same body, and they was as different as night and day. The black kid was barely alive, and the white guy, my wife's friend, he passed away. Some would call it reincarnation. My wife said it was cosmic fate. Some would say it was a bag lady's magic, not a second too late. Well, those dudes had themselves [banging] a serious identity crisis. [hip hop music] - [Yves] I love this, it's wonderful!

Please could you help me? - Leave him alone. - Shut up! He don't believe I'm no witch. - Oh, I believe you. - Yeah. - Bullshit! If you're a witch, how come you ain't got nothin' to drink? - Magic! I owe you one! [bum groans] - A good deed can come back to haunt you. - Know what I'd like to do? - What? - I'd like to put your butt in a cockroach. Yes, I'll betcha I can find one right in here. - [Bum] Uh-uh! [Hag yells] - [Sebastian] Boy, she was sure dirty, huh, pop? - [Yves] Don't be such a snob, son. - What, she was obviously crazy, I mean-- - One never knows, do one? Come, come with me, we'll go through the lobby. Come on. [funky hip hop music] - [Chilly D] Bad for your health, you know what I'm saying? [suspenseful music] [laughs] Yes, indeed. - Good luck with the show, Mr. Malmaison. - Dad, dad, we're late for the show already. - First I must get glamorous. Ah, he's a real redhead, see? Red hair, red hair, I never miss it. Punctuated by freckles. I can't resist it. - Dad-- - Blondes can visit, brunettes can frizz it, but if you're sexy and born with it, red hair is exquisite! - Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad! [man screaming] - Show me an elevator, charge! - I'm really sorry. - Yeah? Yo, Mr. Eastwood, what's happening? This is yo homeboy, Chilly D, calling you from NYC. Chilly D, as in designer, baby. Now listen, that new double-breasted pinstripe suit I got for you is fresh, you gonna love it. Hold the line, baby, hold the line. Yeah, yeah, Redford, listen man, I'm sorry man, I cannot design no clothes for you because you just don't have the look. See, you kinda square. Nah, I gotta run man. You gonna have to postpone the movie then, right? - Dad, maybe it's a better idea if I didn't come to work with you. - Oh, now don't talk that way. Listen, I'll behave, you'll see. We'll make up for all the lost years, huh? [speaking French] - You know I don't speak French! - Ah, but you are French. Didn't they teach you language at that expensive piece of shit school I sent you to? - Yes, I learned sign language. And I'm only half French, Mom is American, remember? - Do you love me? - Yes, you know I love you. - Even though I'm not some macho dad who farts and drinks beer? Turn your head, turn your head, drinks beer and watches football all the time? - Yes, even though you're very, very weird, you're all the dad I got and I love you. [elevator bell dings] - Liz, right, lunch with you and Michael at Sardi's? Life at the top, baby. Life. [door opens] What's up, man? Yo, man! - What are you doing in my leather chair? - Chill out man, I'm just dusting, that's all man. - Dad, he's just the janitor. - That's right, I'm your friendly, meticulous janitor. Good man, good luck with the show tonight. - Yeah, I need a drink. [speaking in foreign language] - No drinking, remember your liver problem! You want another [speaking in foreign language]? Sebastian, you're so big! [speaking in foreign language] - Don't know nothing about no clothes! What's up with him? Get out of my chair, you street thug! - Why, Uncle Max, didn't dad tell you? I'm out of school early. I'm joining the company. - What? - Is it all right? - Yes, of course, I'm just surprised. My stupid younger brother never tells me anything. He's so busy with his designing although he hasn't come up with anything really new in years. [speaking in foreign language] [ominous music] Yves, a new partner from overseas is waiting. - Uncle Max, why do we need a new major partner? - There, there, my nephew-- - Yes! - Business is very complicated. - Exactly my feelings! - What do we need-- - [Max] Not now, Yves, the show! - My show? - [Max] Your show is about to start, our new partner is downstairs waiting! - Well he will just have to wait until I get my-- [shouting] [wailing] - [Sebastian] Are you all right? - My favorite, it's ruined! - [Max] You'll get your turn, Sebastian. [speaking in foreign language] Let's go! - Thank God, I'm still gorgeous. Okay kids, showtime! - Get out of that leather chair, you street thug! Yo man, life's a bitch, I'm up here smoking tampon cigars. Old queen like that gets everything handed to him, and homeboy Chilly D has to get his shit the old fashioned way, stealing. [electric zapping] - [Man] Where are they? [soft jazz music] - Come with me, my sweet flower. Oh darling, you look good. [cameras clicking] Huh, hello, eh, you are? - I am Narish Duriswami Paresha. You must call me Narish. But, of course, I know who you are, Mr. Malmaison. You are famous. - Well, thank you. - [Max] Narish Paresha, our new partner, of course my brother recognizes your name. A historic meeting. This is my nephew, Sebastian Malmaison. - Pleased to meet you, sir. - Will you do me the honor of having a drink with me? - A drink? Yes, of course, I will! [ominous music] - [Narish] It's a traditional drink, no alcohol. - No alcohol? [laughs] Sebastian, perhaps you would like mine? - No! No, we'll get another for him. To the collection. East meets West. [glasses clinking] - Where are they? - Shit, what happened to you man, where's what? - Hey, hey, here's one! - One what, what's he talking about? - Yes, one from the new shipment of dresses. You have taken from other new shipments before. Why? - Because man, latest shit! Girls like to look fly, okay? [punching] [grunting] - Don't do the crime-- - Yo man! Don't mess with me man. - If you can't do the time. - [Man] The truth. - Okay, okay, I got a lot of sisters. They're all graduating from school at the same time and they're gonna go to the prom. Okay man, look, it was wrong for me to steal. I'm gonna give you my money ring. I'll give you my gummy bears and my big pen. Now, leave me alone! [punching] - So after your father designs these exquisite gowns, my company on the island of Hatiosiris manufactures them and we ship them here. Several shipments have all arrived and our relationship to your company has flourished. - Dad, you're too much. Dad, you all right, you okay? - [Yves] Yes, listen, Sebastian, I want you to meet the police inspector and his lovely wife, Anne. - Pleased to meet you, young man. Wonders never cease. - Listen up, you know, you owe me a favor since I let you steal my most lovely model. The question is security, eh? All this thievery, you know, I lose many dresses before-- - I'm sure that the inspector has much bigger problems than a missing garment or two. Now, my brother is exaggerating, as usual. - I'm not exaggerating! - Yves is still designing clothes no one wants to wear. I mean, look at this! - Calvin! - [Calvin] Tacky gold thing! - Calvin, what are you doing here? - Your brother invited me. Someone in the family has some class. - You bitch! You bitch! What, what, what possessed you to come to this place? What are you doing here, huh? - The same thing everyone else is doing, old man. Laughing at your collection! [punching] - Please man, what's up? [smacking] - We find it. All of it. - I'm on your side, man. [men grunting] [crowd chattering] - [Calvin] Stop it, you old bald barracuda! Yves. Yves? - [Max] Yves is having a heart attack, get a doctor. Get a doctor! - [Calvin] Yves, are you all right? - [Max] He'll be fine. - [Calvin] Yves! - [Sebastian] Dad! [dramatic music] [funky music] [man screaming] [Chilly D gasping] [Yves gasping] - Help me! I'm dying! - [Hag] Sit on it, sweetheart. You ain't no Lazarus and I ain't no Jesus. - [Yves] I'm dying, you owe me! - I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can! [electricity crackling] Hocus. [electricity whooshing] Pocus! [metal bangs] [Chilly screams] Stop him! [Chilly screaming] Nocus! [electricity crackling] [awning crashing] [siren wailing] I did it! [laughs] - Calvin, monsieur, it was not your fault. Yves died of a heart attack. [Calvin sobbing] Sebastian Malmaison, look. This is the first $1,000 dollar bill your father and I ever made. He always carried it with him for good luck. I know he would've wanted you to have it. You okay, Sebastian? - I just can't believe he's gone. - [Nurse] Come on, you know what today is? Oh, here we go. Ooh, oh! This is the day we take all these old nasty bandages off. All these ugly bandages. Now, you been in a coma ever since you bounced off the canopy and hit that sidewalk, and you ain't been much fun to talk to, either. Ooh, child, we better hurry up. Else you gonna make me miss All My Kids. And today is the the day that Luke finds out that Sarah is alive. [gentle organ music] - Who is that? - Oh, the blonde guy, there that's Luke. - Where's Sebastian? - Oh, he ain't in this soap. Oh, there's Sarah. Ooh, they gonna kiss. [both screaming] - What's going on here? - Oh doctor, how'd I know he was gonna faint when he saw Luke kiss Sarah? - Someone mistakenly diagnosed this man as brain dead. Look here, look here, he's in perfect health. Other than a slight concussion he could play for any pro football teams. - She's black. He's black! I'm black. We're all black! I'm in a black [speaking in foreign language]! What have you done to me, huh? - A joker, huh? Look Mister-- - Uh, Chilly D. - Chilly whatever your name is, I don't know how you snuck into intensive care, but I'm on to you. And as of now, you're outta here. - No, you can't do this to me, please! I'm being manhandled! What did you do to my hair? I paid a $1,000 dollars for that hair! You ethnic son of a bitch! [thudding] - Whoa, what is this? [upbeat Latin music] This is a wonderful thing! I've been looking for a new look like this. What's the matter with you? 'Cause I'm gonna tell you something right now, I'll trade you for this jacket. Unique suits here, antique. I got garbardine, sharkskin. You're a sharkskin man, I know. You drive a hard bargain. - Have you got some hair? Perhaps a wig? - Wigs? Wigs, I got a wig for you! Come over here, I got something to match anything. There's a wig I'd really like to show you. I got a sharkskin suit here. Come on in here. [funky disco music] Say, say, say, you forget these in your pocket! Come on. I know you want those. - Okay. - Gonna need the maid there. Look what I did for you! Don't worry about it, you'll grow into it. Now come back anytime, any time at all, you come back! - Chilly? - No, no, merci, no thank you. - Can you handle it? - Ooh, I'd love to! Oh, I just love your James Brown hair. My name is Doris Dot. Well, what do you want in here? - I'm not so sure. - Shy, huh, honey? - Is that a Yves Malmaison dress? It's very nice. Why didn't I think of these redesigns? - Yes, it is delightful, isn't it? A friend of a friend redesigned it. I use it in my act, I'm a singer. Doris Dot. Polka dots, get it? - Miss Dot, would you be so kind as to buy me a drink or-- - What, buy you a drink? You got your shit reversed, ain't you, honey? You cute, but you ain't that cute. Now, bye bye. [exotic music] - You're interrupting my tea. What is it? - He's gone, sir. He's been dismissed from the hospital. - Yes, they told us our cousin was brain dead, but it was all a mistake. Suddenly, after three days I go for some tea and he comes out of his coma and lives. - What? - Oh, one more thing, he was acting sorta funny when he left. [machinery rumbling] - Yves still hadn't caught on to where he was at. - We're getting home, we're gonna get a drink. Home again, home again. Here I am. My God, I have got that fool's keys! - In the spirit, or even in someone else's flesh, Yves had evolved his ways. [dramatic music] [soft jazz music] - [Woman] Oh my God, who are you? Get out of here! - This is my house! - [Woman] Get out! [both screaming] [electricity buzzing] [thudding] [glass shattering] - Oh my, God! - You gave him a good hit, honey. - Well Yves, I mean, Chilly, now that he got hit, was back to his old self again. ♪ Disrespected ♪ And when I hit, I get disconnected ♪ ♪ Trying to hit hard [siren wailing] [tires screeching] - [Chilly] Yo, Brenda what the shit-- Yo, Charlene, what's up? - Chilly, where you been? Man, what is with this hair? - Huh? Oh, shit! - [Brenda] Hey Chilly, where'd you get this car? - You would not believe it, but yours truly has been designing clothes for Lionel Richie in Japan. He gave me a bonus. - Oh, come on! - Y'all don't believe me? - You lie! - Would I lie to you? - Yeah. - The proof is in the car. Get in the car. - All right. Let's go, Charlene. [cheering] - [Man] We got Chilly, man! Been waiting for a week, Chilly! - If I had my Roscoe boy, I'd blow your ass off right now! Understand what I'm saying, man? - Y'all can always kill me later, right? I just need a ride man, some weird stuff's been going on. I gotta talk to you, man. [all chattering angrily] I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what, man. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna treat you all to some burgers, man, cheeseburger. - Cheeseburger! - Cheeseburger, aw, man! - Come on, man, I'll let you drive!

Let me get some coleslaw with that. Yeah, one of them little coffees over there. Two or three coffees please. Milk and sugar in that bad boy. Yo, milk and sugar, man! - Homeboy, a little static here! - [Chilly] Homeboy, will you pass me the ketchup, please? [police radio chattering] - [Man] Chilly! [siren blaring] Chilly! - Yo man, do not I get a Burger Bun hat for any purchase over $20 dollars, right? Please? Uh-huh, all right. Hey, yo, man! That's some cold shit! You see how people treat you once you get a little status in life? That's cold, man, my homeboys gonna do me like that. [thunder booming] - [Man] Someone is approaching the premises, perhaps. [ominous music] - [Man] No, we haven't. - [Man] Yes, we have now, jacket, hat everything. North side, a positive ID. [clattering] - Oh, shit. Someone's been searching my place, man. - [Man] Is it him? [speaking foreign language] - Look. Aw, man. They didn't even water my plant. [answering machine beeps] - [Man] Hey, who's there? [gunshots firing] - [Bambi] Hi, Chilly, this is Bambi. Bye. - I'll call her tomorrow, I guess. [answering machine beeps] [clattering] This feels so good. [gunshots] Just need to search my pad. [screaming] [thudding] [light clicking on] What's the deal? Hey, hey, yo! [crashing] [electricity zapping] [rap music] [speaking French] Who are you, what's this? - Hi, sexy! Did you miss little, freaky me? - [Chilly] No, no. - I came to say thank you for the dress. It was beautiful, but I thought it would only... Get in the way. - [Chilly] No, wait! - But I didn't think it would fit in tonight. - [Chilly] Oh, no! [whip cracking] You don't understand, I'm not who you think I am, really. [screaming] No! [screaming] It's hot! Oh, no, please, no, no, no, let me go! You're making a terrible mistake. Please, I'll give you lots of money. I'm a very rich designer. I'm not into this. - You ain't going nowhere, but up and down. - Oh, no. [screaming] Please, it's a mistake. I'm Yves Malmaison, the designer. No, you don't understand. Oh, no, no, please! I'm a vegetarian. [screaming] - Mr. Sebastian, I bet you're nervous about your meeting with Mr. Narish Paresha, aren't you? - You know, whenever I'm nervous, I hit the bullseye every time. Damn, where is my uncle Max? He's supposed to be in this meeting with me. Did you call him on the yacht? - Five times, just like you asked me, Mr. Sebastian. [phone rings] Ooh! Good morning, Yves Malmaison. Rosa? No, Rosa was dismissed last week along with all the other office personnel. I'm Sue, the temporary secretary. Although, you know, if I do good, they just may keep me on permanent. What? Now, that's not funny, that's just plain sick. Some sick man claiming to be your father, I swear. [phone buzzes] This is Mr. Narish Paresha. He would like to see you in his office right away. [phone rings] Hello? Yves Malmaison, how may I-- It's you again. You're just an old sicko, you know that? - It's... - Hey, where are you going? - Hello, there. - Yo, delivery for 1409. - Pick up for 1204. - All right. - Pick up for 1809, yo! - Yeah. - Right on! [sucking] - I've been going over the books. It seems we're not doing as well as we should. So there will have to be personnel streamlining. You have one week to find another job. Now, if you'll excuse me. I wish to be home for 12 o'clock tea. - No, no, no, no, no, no, you can't go in there! - [speaks French] Really, just leave me alone, my God. - Help! Help! This is that crazy I was telling you about. - All right, enough, enough! Who the hell are you? - Sebastian, it's me, your father! Who the hell is this southern fried idiot? - Hey! - Where is Rosa, huh? What's going on here? Who's in my office, what's going on here? - Sue, Sue, call security. - Good idea. - Oh, call security, why not, call security, okay? I'll tell them about when you were just 16 and you stole my Jaguar. About how you beats off in the men's room, eh? [Sue gasps] Call security! - Sue, wait outside. Who you are, who put you up to this? I want answers now! - You want answers? So do I, okay, we're gonna get some answers. We're going to the doctor, Sebe, to figure this whole thing out. - Sebe, only my father calls me Sebe! - Now let's get this straight, you're not dead. - No? - [Doctor] Well so there was no murder, right? - I don't know, no, yes! Oh, Lord! [speaks French] - I can't help you. - You're never gonna find Chilly D's apartment. - Light in the loafers doesn't mean light in the head. - In a couple days the board is gonna vote and sell the company to Narish. - No, no, no, listen, you don't understand. - There's nothing you can do about it! - Yves Malmaison does not take this shit from anybody, no way! - [Sebastian] Dad, Dad, Dad, let's just leave well enough alone. - I need a drink, Sebastian. Please! - [Sebastian] No, no, you don't know what kind of diseases you're gonna catch! - I have a new liver, watch this. Excuse me, my soul sister black person. You could perhaps spare a little sip of this alcohol for me please? [tires screeching] Huh, huh? Hello, huh, you see how nice they are? You just have to know how to deal with people. That's all it is-- [motorcycle revving] [dramatic music] - [Sebastian] Look Dad, that's Chilly D. - She's gonna kill me! Help me, Sebastian! She deaf. Sebe, please! - [Sebastian] Do you know sign language? - Hurry up! - She does, she hasn't for awhile, but she does, yeah. - Does she know where he lives, ask her. - I'm Sebe. You're Roxy, Roxy. - Ask her if she knows where he lives. - Do you know where he... Um, where he lives? Near where you work. Okay, all right, all right, okay. - [Chilly] What about me? - There's only room for two. [engine revving] - Wait for me! [Yves wailing] [disco music] Sebastian! Sebastian! Damn! Whoo! My feet hurt. Everything's going wrong. Where's that little threat to society anyway? I'm going to kick her ass, where is she? - Roxy, she went to work. - Now you call her Roxy, just like that. You know, she tried to kill your father. You have no loyalty to me at all? You call her Roxy? - You cheated on her just like you did with Mom. - Cheated on her? I don't like girls. I don't even know the bitch, your mother was an exception and a mistake, okay? - Look, I don't know who you think you are, but you never talk about my mom like that, okay? - [speaks French] Come on! - Maybe I'll just leave, all right? - No, you're coming with me, Mr. Chickenshit son, you hear me? You're coming with me! [footsteps banging] - Why couldn't I have a normal dad, a bum, a drunk, anything! - Shut up, please! Look, I tell you, someone's been searching this place looking for something. His phone book, I remember this all, huh? He sees more women than a Park Avenue gynecologist. Annette, Annabelle, she has big boobs. He describes them, likes chocolate. Green gown. That son of a bitch! He gave her my green gown, look at that! Oh man, I'm keeping this one as evidence. - That's a picture of Roxy. God, is she beautiful! - [speaks French] You have bad taste. Turn on the light, Sebastian, I must have some light! - [El Toro] Anything you say, Chilly. - Who said that? - Where the hell you been, Chilly D? - What's with the Clairol hair and sweetie clothes, bro? - Being arrested in that stolen vehicle's a very humiliating experience. - Yeah, it wasn't no fun, neither. We had to spend the whole night in jail. - We forfeited two concerts because of you. You approximately owe us $741 dollars. - And today's the big bebop rap contest! Hurry up, man, I'll shoot your little chicken-- [Yves screams] - Wait a minute! What about his girlfriend? - I'm sure you appreciate good rap music, don't you? - Well, I suppose-- - Well, that's good, 'cause you coming with us, bro. Just shut up! - Oh, my God! Oh, no! - [El Toro] Come on, man! - [I.Q.÷} Get your wimpy ass in here! - Take that shit off your head and put your costume on now! - Okay! - Ahora, come on, we late, man! - [Chilly] Beautiful fringe design. - [El Toro] No shit, you did that! - [Chilly] I did? - [I.Q.] The only reason we let you in our group is 'cause you design good rags, man! - [Chilly] This, what is this? - [El Toro] Put your shit on now! [crowd shouting] - Dad, Dad, Dad, we are in real trouble. You're not a rapper! - Hold my hat for me. Sebastian, you must learn to relax. You don't understand something about me. I have a lot of exposure. I have a lot of colored friends. I knew Ali, I knew the Jacksons, I knew Elvis. - Elvis was white, Elvis was white! - But Elvis had very dark hair, okay? Sebastian, relax, look at these black kids, they're so wonderful, I must participate. It's just having the right look. You gotta sometimes grab life by the balls. - So, what'd you think of that last act? [loud booing] - By the balls, by the balls, Dad. - All right, we got some bloodthirsty babies in the house tonight. Hopefully our next contestants will win your favor and meet with your approval.

I only wish you could come visit us in Paris, eh Sebastian, huh? I mean, there we French are so democratic. We treat everyone like shit, all of them equally. [chuckles] You know, Sebe, I've been thinking. Maybe this whole thing about me becoming a black man, there's a reason for it because now I know what it is to be a working class, a real blue collar. I mean, I've discovered my roots. - One night in jail and you've discovered your roots? - You cynical piece of upper-class shit! How can I expect you to understand? You're always making fun of me! No! [speaks French] I mean, look at their faces, look at them. I mean, they have such brotherhood, such humility. - You better shut the fuck up before I piss in your ear! - Yeah, boy! - Such honesty. [vomiting] Oh God, I'm dying here! [sobbing] I can't take it! - What happened to Karl Marx? What happened to discovering your roots? I called the Commissioner, he should be getting us out. [bars rumbling] - I am rich, white famous member of the ruling class, and I'm offering a thousand dollars to any one of you prison people who can get me out of here. Okay? A thousand dollars! - Yeah, well, I'm El Toro Rivera from the projects, man! And I don't care how many faggot personalities you got, man. Your ass is mine! - Oh, shut up, Brillo head. [uproarious yelling] - Quiet down, quiet down, I just got word that I'm to let you two troublemakers out of here right now. And as for the rest of you, well you can go in about an hour or so.

[speaks French] - I don't think he believed me. Listen, as a white man that wig looks silly enough, but as a black man, you look like Dionne Warwick in drag. - I think it makes me look like Clark Gable or something, no? - Here, then at least cover it. [speaking French] Listen, we gotta go, Narish leaves his office at exactly 11:45 for his noon tea. - Hey, Chilly dude, isn't that you? I heard you were in the hospital, man. Must've been a bummer, huh? - Sure, honey. - You again? I'm gonna call the police. I swear I will holler rape-- - Hey, keep your panties on baby. 'Cause you know what, no one is interested, okay? - Rape! - No one. - Rape? - [Sebastian] Did Max call? - This girl called on behalf of someone named Roxy, but she left no number. - You give King Kong with titties your phone number? Come on, baby baby, just hold the calls. We'll be right here in the conference room. - [Sue] Mr. Sebastian, am I doing good so far? - Yeah, yeah, great, Sue. - Well the temporary agency said if I did good I could stay! - Oh, sweet, I love it. - Dad, Dad, this is not happy hour!

[snapping] - What am I now, your slave? - [Chilly] Huh, what'd you say? This is how you treat me now, huh? Where's my respect, this is how you treat your father? - Start acting like a father and maybe I'll start treating you like one. - [speaking French] That's enough of that! Hey Sebe, that's enough of that! [phone ringing] - Yes? - Mr. Narish Paresha? Hi, this is Sue, the temporary secretary. You told me to let you know just as soon as Mr. Sebastian Malmaison showed up.

I've known her for six months and all I got was a little kiss. - [Sebastian] Chilly, I gotta tell you something. - She says I screw around too much, she might leave me, but what can I do man? My resistance to women is real low, bro. Can't you see I'm in love? - [Sebastian] Chilly-- - Go, Roxy, baby! - We need to talk! - Whoo! Yeah!

I had my quarter out, puttin' it in the machine. - And why you all dirty? - Well see, I got in this fight with these four big dudes, but being the man that I am, it was nothing that I couldn't handle, you know? - You know, actually, I kinda like this renegade, muddy fashion statement that you're making. But, you know, sweetheart, there've been some weird dudes looking for you. But important business, you gonna be at my house at 10 o'clock. - Yeah. - Say it. - I'm gonna be at your house at 10 o'clock. - That's right, you ain't gonna be late. - No, no! - Tell me that you love me. - I love you. - Say, I love you, Domino. - I love you, Domino. - Okay, here comes your fat friend, all right? - I mean it, Domino, I really do, I love you. - Okay, gimme a kiss.

Things have been doing down weird, you wouldn't believe. Oh man, I love your big butt. What's wrong with him, man? What's up with him, man? - Yeah? Why don't we take a little walk outside so we can have a talk in private with you, man? Come on, let's go. - That's cool, brother. Listen man, a lot of stuff's been happening y'all wouldn't believe. - Oh, yeah? - I'm telling you man! - Talk to me! - Let's go outside. - Tell me somethin', bro! - All right man, so dig, first this weird kid with glasses was following me, right? Trying to tell me that I was his father, I kid you not. Then we go over to the Mud Club, right, because I figure it's time for me to let Roxy go, you know-- - You dumped Roxy? - Yeah man, you know, I mean, she was hugging me, begging me to stay. That's why she got mud all over my clothes. - Yeah, speaking about your clothes, you dressing kinda funny lately, ain't you, bro? - My theory is that designer shit has messed with your brain. - What do y'all mean by that man? - Which Chilly is you tonight, man? Doctor Jekyll or Mr. Drag? - Nah, ain't but one Chilly here, brothers, the one that's trying to get y'all a record deal. Where you been, man? - The only records you've been gettin' us is police records. - Hey, what seems to be the problem with y'all? - You the problem, Chilly! You the problem, man! I'm not playing with you! - He ain't playing man, this boy don't play! [gunshot] I dropped my gun! - Shit! [gun firing] [all yelling] - [El Toro] Look man, hey, Chilly!

Okay, now we're gonna get out of here before that girl Godzilla gets back. We're gonna borrow her mobile-- - Oh no, maybe we should ask her. I mean, we haven't even said goodbye yet. - You, listen, Narish is going to buy our company tomorrow from the board, we lose everything! You want that, huh? - Well no, of course not. [speaks French] - Listen, you don't have to say goodbye. Plus, you already have your pillow. You don't even need a girl. How many more we got left?

My God, are you all right? - Yeah, are you? - You're giving me a headache, you know? Well, I wanna show you something. - [Sebastian] Oh wow, I almost forgot about this old place. I remember these darts. - I bought you that dart set when you were eight years old and I used to sit right over here. You got very good at it and I designed dresses and that's when your mother took you away from me. - Why? - Why'd she take you away? Basically, because she's a bitch. - Mom said that you-- - You don't understand, Sebastian, I was in love with your mother. Yes, in love with her! She had this incredible red hair. [speaking French] She was my first model. I remember once I designed a gown for her with shoulder pads twice as thick as these old pads here. She was just like Joan Crawford. - What did you say? - Joan Crawford, you know, the actress? - No, no, before that. - Twice as thick as these old pads? - Those pads aren't old, it says here they were shipped in from Missouri two weeks ago. - No, that's impossible, Sebastian. When the gowns come from overseas, they already have the pads in them, we don't need new pads. - It just doesn't make sense. - Well unless these replace the ones from overseas, but... What if the ones from overseas have something else that's inside? - And Chilly D stole a dress, before good old Narish had the chance to sew into the pads. - A dress that Narish would be willing to kill over. Anyone that found out would be in trouble, maybe disappear. - Let's just call the police commissioner and let him take-- - No, no, it's impossible because he already thinks we're crazy fruits. - Chilly D stole hundreds of gowns and distributed them among the greater half of the female population of New York City. How are we gonna find the right one? - It's easy, we just start with the As. Watch, see? We go right through to the rest. - All right, okay, let's say that we could find the girl with the right gown, what are we gonna say? Hello, excuse me, you don't know me, but I'm a friend of Chilly's, please can I put my hands in your gown? Hello, Pauline, hi, you don't know me, but I'm a friend of Chilly D's, he-- [squeaking] He what? He stood you up? Well, he really feels bad about that and he wants to make it up to you. Yeah, he wants, tonight, yes tonight. Yes, tonight at seven, uh, 7:05. Yeah, at 7:05. Oh yeah, and you turn him on, too, oh yeah! All right, so he especially wanted me to tell you to wear the blue Yves Malmaison gown. Yes, the one that makes your eyes, yeah, the sexy one. Okay, all right, so he'll see you at 7:05. Look, you only have five minutes between girls. I don't see how you're gonna do this. - No, no, no, you don't understand. I understand women, Sebastian, relax. I look fabulous, leave me alone, let me, I know how to handle women. I know what they like, relax. - All right, okay. No wait, Dad, you have to remember you're a hip black dude. - Black dude, okay, right. - You're hip and black. All right? - Shit, man. - No, no, no, it's too delivered, it has to be organic. - [speaking French] You stay here, five minutes, that's all you have. - Alright, okay. - Let me handle this, okay?

This is Thursday. I recommend we recess until Friday afternoon to consider these new developments before we vote. - Sebe, man, what didn't you let me chop them suckas? You dissing me, bro! I'm hungry, man. I'm hungry man, I'm hungry, okay? - Fine, get us hot dogs, all right? - Okay, man, get with it! - Sebastian, what the hell is going on here? - Listen, I can't explain now, but Narish is into some kind of drug deal. - What? - The proof is in the pads, pads he's smuggling over in our dresses. - I'm supposed to meet with Narish now. - No, no, no, you have to get in touch with the inspector. - Why don't you talk to the inspector? What am I supposed to say to Narish? - He's not gonna believe us. The inspector will listen to you, Max. - That is true and I'm supposed to speak to him on the telephone. I'm going to the opera, but I could invite him to my yacht at 7:30 this evening. - Great, great, 7:30, perfect. Listen, I'll do all the talking. As for Narish, just act natural. Max, you can do it. - Sebe, man, you should've let me talk to them suckas. Man, I'm telling you, I know how to straight shit out for you, man! - The larger picture behind door number three is our boys are learning nothing comes easy. They're battling for truth, justice, and a piece of the pie. Learning about themselves in the process and trying not to die. - You must do something. - Yes, you are correct. Not to worry, the solution has been revealed to me. - Okay, let me know as soon as you know anything. - Okay. - [Chilly] Yo man, these long whitey coats are the shit, jack! - [Sebastian] Did you have to buy four of them? - [Chilly] That's right, man! I gotta recut 'em down, give 'em the Chilly Willy touch. - My credit card bill is gonna be Chilly-- - I can't wear that Liberace sparkle shit, bro. How do we know Uncle what's-his-shit is not in on this drug deal? - [Sebastian] Don't you trust anybody? - No! - That is my uncle! - [Chilly] Hey man, I've been in a foster home since I was six. - Just do whatever the hell you want, all right? Uncle Max? [classical music] Max. Max? Max! Uncle Max, I'm here. Max? Max. Uncle Max, I'm here. [ominous music] [screaming] [laughing] Don't you ever, ever do that to me again! - Okay man, relax, where's your sense of humor? [sniffs] Ew, this shit smell like wild ox farts, man. - It's a French cheese. It's a delicacy, okay? - So it's the delicacy shit, okay? So this is how you dynasty folks live, huh? Where's Uncle what's-his-face? - He probably just stepped out and he'll probably be right back, so don't steal anything! - You mind if I take a piss? Is that okay with you, all right? - The head's down there to your left. - I don't need a head, man, I need a toilet, bro. - Head means toilet in boat talk. - Don't diss me, man, I was just testing you out, okay? I'm educated in my own damn way, Sebe. [toilet flushes] [screaming] Yo, Sebe! There's a dead dude in here, man! I ain't bullshitting, Sebe! Get this sucker off me, man! Yo man, this dude's dead! - [Sebastian] Relax! - This is bullshit, man! Oh, shit! - He's still alive. Max, can you hear me? [Max groaning] - I'm cool, man. Hey, what's this bra, man? - [Sebastian] Max, who did this to you? - Narish. He double-crossed me. He poisoned your father, but I went along with him. - I told you man, I told you-- - Shut up! - Okay, okay. - [Sebastian] Max, you're delirious, man. You don't know what you're saying, come on. - Listen to me, there's no time left. We invited Calvin to the collection so that they would fight and it would look like a heart attack. Now, get off... - Come on, talk to me. Turn down the music, so we can hear what he's saying. Come on man, hang in there, bro. Hang in there, man, you can do it. Come on, old dude, talk to me. Hey, get off the what, get off the what? Talk to me, man. - The boat. - Hey, don't you talk, hey, come on man! We ain't going nowhere till you talk to me. - Hey, he's dead. [ticking] - Sebe. Sebe, man, do you hear that loud ticking sound? You hear that? The boat's, it's gonna blow! Come on, man! [bomb ticking] [seagull cawing] I don't believe this shit, man! Somebody stole the motherfucking pier, the pier! We're gonna be lost just like Gilligan's Island, man. - [Sebastian] We gotta swim. What? - I can't fucking swim, okay? I can't swim! Sebe, can your father swim? - Yeah, why? - Okay, man, hit me on the head with this. Hit me, hit me, hit me. - What for? [thudding] - Harder, harder! It's not working, man. - Listen, we're gonna do this the old fashioned way, okay? All right? - I'm trusting you, Sebe. - [Sebastian] Now, walk to the edge. - I'm on the edge man, I'm seriously on the edge. - Okay. Ready? Now, jump. - [Chilly] No! - Jump! - No! - All right. [both screaming] [splashing] Oh shit, the bra! Come on, we gotta go back and get it! - Forget the fucking bra! I'm gonna kick your ass if I get back on shore. If Jaws don't eat me. I'm drowning, Sebe! [loud explosion] [funky dance music] [telephone rings] - Hey, it's him all right. Am I interrupting something? - What? - Am I interrupting something? - No, no, no, of course not. - You said to call as soon as I knew for sure. It's definitely Yves Malmaison. The dental records were an exact match. - Thanks. Fuck a duck! - Quack, quack. - You know something, baby? Narish is a slick towel head sucker. I bet he's got the cops convinced we killed Uncle what's-his-face, right? Then we got blown up in the process. If we show back up, we're wanted for murder. And if we don't, homeboy gets his company, am I right? - Everything's blown to shit anyway. I mean, all the plans I had with my father. I really wanted to help him out with the business. Now it's all gone. And... For the first time in my life, I don't know what comes next. - Hey, chill out, man. I never know what comes next, I'm not down, right? Around my way, you get two choices, man, shoot hoops or steal. I'm too short to shoot hoops. I'm too scared to steal anything better than a funky gown or dress, right? I can't rap much, but you know what I wanna do? I wanna design man, like your father does. Except for, if I admit that to my boys, they'd kick my butt thinking I'm a punk or something, man, 'cause they're prejudiced. They just look at you like that, you know? - You know, that's the first thing you ever said to me that you didn't make a joke out of it. So anyway, what's up for you next? - I guess whatever comes up next, I'll do. I just wish we knew when that next shipment was coming in, man. - What do you mean? - Well, they wouldn't have ordered all these shoulder pads unless they were expecting more dope, right? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We can find out when the next shipment is coming. - No, no, no, no, Sebe, look, they're would've changed the ledgers because they know we stole the books. They would've changed all the dates, man. - No, they think we're dead, remember? - Right. - Right. - I got an idea, no, no, no, no. - What, no, what, no. - I had an idea, but it would take too many soldiers. Forget it. - No problem, we can get soldiers. - Is this real? [screaming] - Okay! - You know, you talk a whole lot of shit! You pushed us too far! When's this old lying shit stop? - Yo, hey, yo, yo, listen up! Huh? Here's a thousand dollars in cash! How does that buy your trust? Hey, keep away. Keep away, all right? - Yo Sebe, where'd you get that cash money from? - Shut up! All right, now listen, you want this, you want it? - I want it, Sebe, I need it! - Okay, okay. - Yeah! - What the fuck? - You get half now-- - Sebe, what you doing? - Oh, man! - And half later. If, if you listen to my man here and what he has to say. - Damn it, right. We had this all planned, my man, yo, up high! I told you we had it perfect financially. Okay fellas, now just, please. Okay, listen up, get around this table man. I'm gonna run it down with you, get this shit done quick. All we got to do is just steal a little teeny dope shipment. [all shouting] - [Sebastian] Listen to him! - Please, just listen to me, listen, please. - That is crazy dangerous! - Not really man, not really. - Yo man, why we got to do that, man? - Okay, look, it's just like a little thing, a little bait to catch the big criminals. You dig what I'm saying? - [Sebastian] And then they can't sell the company. - And then we lock 'em in jail too, right? - Yeah, and throw away the key, right? - It still sounds like some dangerous shit to me! - Now we get the bad guys, right? I get 'em running around all over New York City. I get them going to Brooklyn, Manhattan, Staten Island, right? I got the cops in the right location, once the cops are all there, I'll call up the bad guys and I say yo, we got your stuff and here's the location. They come and the cops arrest them. Play it out, am I right, am I right? [guys groaning] Come on! - Yo wait, chill, chill for a second. Do I get to use my gun? [boat horn blows] [funky suspenseful music] - [Chilly] This is the real deal, everybody. In place, over. - [Inspector] Hey, Randy! - Hey! How you doing? Well, you said to call as soon as I knew for sure. The dental records are an exact match. - [Inspector] Thanks for the prompt service, okay? - [Chilly] Yeah man, let's go! Everybody pull out. - [Randy] It's definitely Yves Malmaison. - [Girl] I see them, man. Here they come, 10-4! - I knew it was a wild goose chase, but you have to follow any leads to a point. [yelling and rioting] I owed him one. He introduced me to my wife. Hey, speaking of that. Cheese with alfalfa or bologna with alfalfa? - Well, I think I'll pass. - My wife's originally from California. - Listen, speaking of your ex-friend, no doubt about it he's deader than a door nail. - His kid's taking it pretty hard, but... - [Sebastian] Cops won't be there 'till one o'clock. - [Chilly] And we're ahead of schedule. - I told the inspector himself. - Keeps calling me with one wild story after another. Sometimes he even pretends to be his father. He called me up again this morning. He wants me to send half the police force to some address for some cockamamie drug deal. - So, what are you gonna do? - It'll pass. Can you just imagine? Some old abandoned barge and warehouse? [funky music] - Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? - No, ma'am. - Yes, I do, too. You that guy that was treated at our hospital and I'm the nurse that undid your bandages. Remember? You ran off without even calling your friends and they was really worried about you. - Miss, I think you have the wrong guy, I'm sorry. - That poor child ain't got no better. [crowd chattering] - Come on now, Roxy, hit it right here. - [Girl] Go Roxy! - Ho, for the posse! - Master, the shipment has been stolen. [crowd chattering] - Hey! - Who is this? - Gentlemen, it seems that we're in possession of your gowns. [all cheering] - They stole the whole shipment. There was nothing we could do. [all laughing] - Alas, do not despair. We will be giving you instructions from time to time. Please remember to keep that limo phone line clear. Head northwest on FDR Drive. Please remember, we're watching your every move. And gentlemen, buckle those seat belts. [laughing] - Wrap that educated shit, go on, man! - [Sebastian] Yo! [phone rings] [humming] - Yes? - You the relative of that fella that got hit in the head and went kind of funny? Oh. Well, remember you asked me to call you if I ever saw him again. Well, he ain't no better. But he's at 1422 6th Street. - Damn, the line is busy! - So what? - It ain't supposed to be. I think we should tell Chilly. - [Nurse] Yeah, he's in there now. He drove a van into this old warehouse. - [Narish] Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. I'm just glad to do a good deed. Bye. - [Narish] Go to the warehouse, the barge at 6th Street. Kill them all. - Stop being so damned paranoid! Look, I'm gonna go check on how that last call went, all right? - Well, thanks. That was sure great. So who did it anyway, the butler? [speaking foreign language] - Did what? - Murdered your designer friend. - Murdered? - Well, yeah, I mean, I haven't had a chance to isolate it yet. It's some sort of exotic chemical that simulates a heart attack. - Fuck a duck! [funky music] [gang yelling] [tape whirring] [guns firing] [punching] [electricity zapping] [gun firing] [all yelling] [water spraying] - [Rock] Yo man, the water's coming in! [gun firing] [thudding] - Why you gotta pull a knife on me? Let's see how tough you are one on one. I'm gonna do a Mike Tyson on your ugly ass. [punching] [grunting] [tape whirring] [groaning] [gun firing] [funky dramatic music] [gun firing] [grunting] [sirens wailing] - [Policeman] Come on out with your hands up! Hands up! The place is surrounded. [machine banging] - [Sebastian] Chilly! Dad! Chilly! Dad! [thudding] [machine sputtering] [ominous music] [gun firing] [sirens wailing] [funky music] - [Policeman] Police, come out, hands up! The place is surrounded! - Chilly. Dad, is it you? - Hey man, we're both here. - What? - Yeah, it's me bro, but, I got all your dad's memories. - You do? - Yeah, everything. What happened to Narish? - Murder. Drug trafficking. Embezzlement. And dead. - Looks like your company's saved, man. - Not just saved, born again. - Right. Sebe and me! [laughing] [crowd cheering] [funky music] - Chilly D, Sebe Malmaison, may I help you? It's the people from LA. - Sebe, may I help you? - I got my scene there. - Yeah, yeah, wait, hold on, hold on! [phone rings] Sebe, Chilly D, Malmaison, may I help you? Man, it's France, you better take it. - Yo brother, what's happening? I mean, [speaks French]. - Wait, hold on, hold on. They want four dozen more, man! - Do it, do it, love it, do it. She is fine, I mean no, not you. Absolutely, absolutely. - Chilly D, Malmaison. - Red hair I always liked redheads. - Michael, how you doing? [telephone ringing] [hip hop music] - Check out what I'm saying. Are you tired of those jeans that never fit? - Or tired of them suckers on a label legal trip? - We're two bad brothers that are dope and hip! - I'm Chilly Willy! - And I'm Sebe! - [Both] We design clothes for you and me!
