What did you see? I remember... falling. I remember... darkness. Noise. And I remember flashing lights and glass. So much glass. I remember. Welcome to case study 2884. It's 13:00, I'm glad you could join us. Post-traumatic amnesia, or PTA as we like to call it, is a phenomenon in which the patient emerges from a coma suffering from some degree of memory loss. Some short term and some longer term. Yes, Mr. Morrow? Is-is that the woman who woke up from a six-year coma? Yes, it is. Sit! It's like starting all over from the beginning. Memories can be affected. Some will come back over time. Some will never come back. But she's running? Already? There is another factor besides plasticity that can have a significant impact on recovery. Not many of us in here have it. And what would that be? Stubbornness. Who knew? It's one of the most amazing discoveries that we've made. Ready to go? Look at that. It's a different world out there now. We've been sheltering you. Word travels. It's just a matter of time before the media pay you a visit. What's the headline? Woman wakes up from coma and draws a complete blank? Most of your memories will come back, but until they do, let's keep the media at bay. They'll just try and confuse you. How do I do that? Hire a bodyguard? Look, I think you have one now. Marissa, honey. Mom. I can't wait to get you home. Here's your personal belongings from when you checked in. You kept all this for six years? Don't go through all that right now, just let the memories come back. Don't force them. I'll take that, honey. Alright. Home, sweet home. Let's get you inside, hmm. Surprise! Stop, please. Just give her some space. I'm sorry, I can't. You ok? You want some cake? I've got your notes here. Left ear, or something. Do you want me to go? Just say the word. Oh, no. Uh... Drink? Are you allowed to? Bottoms up. Wow. You still like a Riesling. Oh. Better? Do I know you? I'm sorry, I just have these flashes, you know, but faces are kinda tricky. I'm Ethan. Oh, hi Ethan. I'm Marissa. Nice to meet you. Again. I mean, you and I, we go way back. Oh. So how do we know each other? Come on, let me introduce you to the Marissa that I know. Ok. That is the Marissa I remember. Well, I'm kinda glad that I don't remember that. Thank you. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. Oh. You know, not only am I an expert table dancer, I'm also a journalist. I'd really like to tell your story. Oh. What do you say? Thanks, but um... I'm not interested. I can get you the lead story. Guaranteed. I don't want the lead story. I just want to be left alone. Just relax. Hear me out. Just hear me out. Wait-What's going on? I'm just a friend of Marissa's. Funny, I don't remember her being friends with a reporter from Channel 3. This is the very first time we've met, isn't it? Marissa, I'm sorry. If you ever need the media on your side, I'll... I'll be good to her. I sent everybody home. Especially that reporter. Can you believe that guy? Honey, I was just so happy to have you back that I wanted to tell the whole world. I didn't stop to think what that would be like for you. I'm sorry, honey. It's ok, mom. Heather. She is going to be so happy to see you. How has she been? She hasn't been quite herself. So many gaps. In all fairness, she was in a six-year sleep. She's bound to be a little groggy. Groggy doesn't even begin to describe it... Here she is. Heather? Marissa. You remember me? It's so good to see you. Oh, here. It's on, here. Congressman Cal Ward announced today that he is running for Senator. Former college football star turned Democrat is known for his fierce commitment to the middle class, creating a ten percent increase in the employment rate while in office. I just want to make one thing clear. This is about family. I'm running for senate for one reason, and one reason only. To finish what the good people of this state started. Congressman Ward begins his state-wide tour stopping at 13 different locations over the next- Wow, it's so good to see you. And you look amazing. So you're... Married. Yeah. I wanted to wait for you so you could be my maid of honour, but we didn't know. You remember Cal? Oh... We were at college together. Well, he's running for Senator. We're in the middle of a campaign. I'm so sorry I missed it. The wedding, dad's funeral. I just missed so much. I'm sorry I missed your party. The campaign, you know. Don't worry about it. I'm not much for parties these days, anyway. I'm so glad you remember me. I have missed you so much. Come on now, you girls. You've got so much to catch up on. Get out of my kitchen, right now. Boy, we do have a lot to catch up on. Well, me mainly. No offense but laying in a bed for six years is hardly riveting. Wait a minute, are you really my BFF? Yeah, and I have the friendship necklace to prove it. This is gonna be harder than I thought. She's not gonna make it. Who's in charge of the anesthetic here? Thank you. Cheers. So what exactly do you remember, then? Bits and pieces. You know, it's like a puzzle. I've got these images in my head, but I just don't know how to fit them all together. Maybe you can help me. Can you tell me about the accident? What is it? Is there something you're not telling me? I don't know what to say. I think it would be dangerous to push you. You get to make a fresh start in life, Marissa. It's time to leave the past alone. Ok? Here, come here. Have this. Ah, it is you. Are you following me? I was trying to get my caffeine fix, which is now all over my pants. Thanks. So this is a coincidence? Yes. But now that I have you here, I want to apologize for crashing your party the other day. You were fresh out of the hospital, I took advantage of that. I lied to you. Yeah, you made me feel like an idiot. I know, it was a dumb move. I'm a jerk, I'm sorry. Ugh. I just want to be left alone! Marissa! Woah! Don't you want to know who almost killed you? What? You were in a hit and run. And the person that put you in that coma is still out there. I can help you bring them to justice. No. It was just me. It was raining and the pavement was wet. That's not how it was. I have photos. I'm a reporter. It's my business to know things. Actually, it's none of your business. If I have a boy, I'm going to name him Lachlan. If it's a girl, I'll name her Abigail, after my grandmother. I would go with Kennedy or Jolie. She's not gonna make it. Who's in charge of the anesthetic here? Marissa! What's the matter? There was a baby. I was pregnant when I crashed. There was a baby. They gave me a c-section. Yes. He was so little. He never even took a breath. A little flower to bud on earth, and bloom in heaven. I told Dr. Novak that we were coming here today. He advised against it. He doesn't think you're ready. You can never be ready for something like this. He was a beautiful baby boy, Marissa. They put him in my arms and it felt like I was holding you again. All those years ago. He was perfectly still. Like a doll. He's gone to a better place. I'm so sorry you're here. It should have been me. Grandma wants me to say goodbye to you, but I can't. So if you don't mind, I think I'm gonna hang on just a little while longer. It's a girl. Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby. She's putting up a good front. She's clearly still in a great deal of distress. It's good that you called me. There's something you're not telling me. I spoke with your mother. She's worried about you, Marissa. I don't know if you're lying to me or trying to protect me, but there was a baby. Well, she appears to be coming around, but if she's exposed to a stressor, we run the risk that she may retreat into fantasy. Marissa, I checked your file. There was a baby! My mother held him, she buried him! That's odd. Maybe a page was missed when Dr. Novak copied your file for me. I'll look into it. But that's not all. The baby that was in the grave? That's not my baby. My baby was a girl, and I think she may still be still alive. What do you suggest? Maybe medication, clonazepam for starters. Isn't that a sedative? Sometimes, when you desire something strongly, your brain can't separate fact from fiction. Obsession can falsify memories. So you think that's what's happening to me? We're going to get through this. I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. Well, maybe we could just stick to routine monitoring for now. How routine, exactly? Well, weekly. For now. Dr. Novak, I have a matter I want to discuss with you later. After my two o'clock. Absolutely. See you later. Bye. See you next week, Marissa. You're making great progress. Thank you, doctor. How'd it go? It was good. Why don't you wait here? I'll bring the car around. Okay. Your two o'clock is here. Thank you. Send him in. Excuse me. I just wanted to say thank you for holding on to my personal belongings. They've been so helpful for me for regaining my memory. What happened to my daughter? Your daughter? I gave birth to her via c-section. I'm sorry, I think you've got me mixed up with someone else. I used to smoke. But I gave it up completely when I knew I was pregnant. Please, I need your help. I'm trying to find my daughter. I'm sorry, you've got the wrong nurse. Isn't it high time that we got back to greatness? Right? I think we can all agree that status quo isn't working. You know, that someone needs to hold that one percent accountable for their actions. Hey? Well, that is exactly what I intend to do. When elected, will lobby for jobs for the hard-working middle class that form the backbone of this great state. So I propose to... I... I... I propose to lobby for jobs. Thanks for stopping by. I didn't know you followed politics. I was just in the area. Thank you so much for coming. Hi, Abby. Manners, Abby. Hi. This is your aunt, Marissa. She's been away for a long time, but now you're going to see a lot of her. Marissa. Hi. Um, Heather told me all about your recovery. Cal. I'm sorry, I know we've met, but I can't remember. Sweetheart, the reporters are waiting, and we have a radio interview. Right. We should go. Heather, how old is Abby? Five. She's five. Marissa? Are you ok? You look like you've seen a ghost. She's alive. Abby, lunch time. Dr. Lapointe? Miss Davis? Did you happen to get a good look at the assailant? No. Not for lack of trying. Ok. Well, if you think of anything else, give me a call. Thank you. Marissa! What were you thinking? You almost got yourself killed! Look around you, mom. Doesn't it tell you I'm getting closer to the truth? It tells me that you're running around on a wild goose chase and you're not thinking about your own safety. I know I'm getting closer. I have some urgent news that I'd rather not say over the phone. Come see me at my office right away. I bet it was one of his crazy patients that went off their rocker. Oh, and they just happened to kill him right after he left me this mysterious message? Nuts can go off at any time. Come on, don't you go getting any crazy ideas, eh? Yeah. Not crazy, but I have an idea. We need him to sign off on these before you go for lunch. Oh, that's ok. I'll take that. Um, you know what? I can't sign anything else until I get a coffee, thank you. Oh, come on. What's one more between friends? There it is again. That look. There are things that... Does everyone make you speechless, or is it just me? Excuse me, can I help you? That's ok, the Congressman and I go way back. It's ok. I'm sorry Miss Davis, I'm just... I'm really busy right now. I'm sorry. It's ok. I can find my own way out. So this is where they found me. Yeah, just over there. This place gives me the creeps. Let's go. I have to pick up Abby from daycare. You know, Ethan Fox told me that it was a hit and run. The news guy? Mmmhmm. I would be careful of him, he doesn't have much of a reputation. Actually, he's starting to grow on me. Wow, this really is the middle of nowhere. What was I even doing out here? It's definitely not the scenic route. Maybe there was something that drew me out here. Or someone. We had come here because we had nowhere else to go. My dad was so sick and I didn't want to upset my mom. This is where I was that day. The day I lost everything. Who was he? I don't know. But whoever he was, he's the father of my baby. Maybe he knows what happened to her. Marissa, he died. No, that's not right. My baby was a girl. Special delivery. Huh? What have you been doing all day? Oh, you know. Out and about. The usual. What is it? Where did you find this? On the doorstep. When? A few minutes ago. Marissa! Where are you going? Marissa! Marissa, what is going on? Did you see anyone? No! What has gotten into you? Exactly this, mom. What is this? It's the day I had the accident, mom. Look. It's her heartbeat, mom! Oh, Marissa. It's a hoax. I buried your baby. What if that was the hoax? What if they gave you a different baby? A baby from a morgue that no one would be missing and they put that baby in your arms and told you it was your dead grandson and no one would know the difference! Enough! You have to stop this fantasy! It's getting out of hand. This is not a fantasy. This is proof. Marissa. I got your message. I didn't send a message. This? I didn't send this. Tell me about my daughter. Please. Come with me. I was an OR nurse at the time. I often worked with Dr. Novak. We got along famously, which is why I followed him to the shiny New Era Clinic even though I knew... The paramedics said you were pregnant so we thought, given your injuries, that the baby would be dead. But then we detected a fetal pulse so Dr. Novak performed an emergency c-section. She's not gonna make it. And you gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Put her on anesthetic! I remember asking someone to get your mom so she could take the baby, but Dr. Novak said there's no point in getting your hopes up since the baby probably wouldn't make it. It was touch and go. She was in the incubator for weeks. And the EKG, how did you get a hold of that? Uh, I was shredding confidential papers and found it. I saw the fax cover page, too. It came from Dr. Lapointe's office on the day he died. So Dr. Lapointe knew? He must have found it in your medical records and made the mistake of confiding in Dr. Novak. Marissa, whoever took your baby rewarded him well for his silence. They foot the bill for his shiny new clinic. His pride and joy. So Novak told his benefactor about Dr. Lapointe. This isn't a game, Marissa. Be very careful. I will. Who took my baby? There was this woman, she was in the clinic at the same time as you. Her baby was stillborn and she was so lost. She wanted a baby so badly. I'm sure she's been an excellent mother. The baby she lost, was it a girl? No, a boy. A sweet little boy. They're gonna be best friends. I know who took her, mom. They're not gonna get away with this. What are you talking about? Took who? I talked to Cynthia. Cynthia who? Where are you right now? I'm on my way to the police station. The police? Why? I know who took my baby! Honey, your baby died. No. No, that's not what happened. Marissa, listen to me. I need you to come home first, alright? Then we'll go to the police. Otherwise they're not going to take you seriously. Marissa? What? Come home first. We'll figure it out. Together, ok? Yeah. Yeah, ok. I'm on my way back. Great. See? I'm so worried about her. She needs help. I remember you. Miss Davis, what's going on? You're driving like a mad woman. I'm just going home. If I'm not mistaken, home is that way. Are you in on this, Peter? Did you help take her? Miss Davis, do you have any idea how many conspiracy freaks I deal with on a daily basis? Congressmen are often targeted by bored, pathetic women like you. He knows me. He knows me. He recognizes me. He loves me. Go home and keep your delusions to yourself, Marissa. Understood? Drive safe. He just came out of nowhere. He ran you off the road? Yeah, and threatened to report me for stalking. Stalking who? Cal. Congressman Ward? Wow, I mean, I guess he's cute and all, but... I'm not stalking Congressman Ward. Peter Vaughn is connected to this. Why else would he follow me? Maybe he thinks you're a legitimate threat to the campaign. No. He's just doing his job. No, it's more than that. So you've unlocked some sort of conspiracy and the players are covering themselves? I just want my daughter back. Your daughter? Abby. Abby? The Congressman's daughter? You think Ward stole your daughter? I think she is our daughter. You think you can prove that? I really would like to have a word with her. Oh, Marissa. Marissa, hello. I was sad to hear about Dr. Lapointe, he was a good man. It must be very hard for you. How are you coping? Well enough that I didn't expect a house call, if that's what you mean. Uh, you know Rose, I think I will have that cup of tea. Of course. Thanks. I just need a moment. I'll cut to the chase. I read Dr. Lapointe's file. He was very concerned about your mental state and now given recent events I'm also concerned. Recent events? Your mother told me that someone tried to run you off the road this morning. I was just startled. Ok. You can tell me the truth, Marissa. Do you think someone tried to hurt you, or do you think that you were really just trying to hurt yourself? Excuse me? I've had patients who have ended their lives. Really all they wanted to do was end the pain. This is incredible. Marissa? I'm sorry. Listen, I can't lie to you. I think that Marissa's illness is escalating. She's suffering from paranoid delusions. She might even have a psychotic break. I'm worried that she might try to hurt herself again. Again? I think that she intentionally ran herself off the road. She needs to take these sedatives. I can't trust her with the whole bottle. I hate to ask, but would you? It's one every four hours. Monitor her closely. Don't let her leave, otherwise anything might happen. In the meantime, I'm going to make arrangements to get her in intensive treatment. What are you looking at? Oh, just an article. How to tell if your own mother thinks you're a lunatic. I don't think that. I think you're overwhelmed. That's just a nice way of saying crazy, mom. So have you booked me an indefinite stay at the loony bin yet? Of course not. We're just concerned, that's all. You don't believe me, do you? You think I'm making all of this up? I think you're still recovering. It's good to know where you stand. I'm on your side, Marissa. I always will be. I'm your mother. Well, then you of all people should know how I feel. She's out there, mom. She needs me. Well then you better get your energy up, because my granddaughter is going to need us in fighting form. Thank you, mom. Now, you eat up, before it gets cold. Ok. Yes, ma'am. You must have been exhausted. After breakfast, you should have a hot shower. Then we'll sort things out. It's a girl. Honey, I... How long has she been gone? Over an hour. Detective MacNiel. I need to put an APB out on one of my clients. She's suicidal and she may be having a psychotic break. What? Come on. I'm here with Congressman Ward and his wife, Heather. Thank you for coming on the show today. Thank you for having us. I'm so sorry to hear about your daughter, Abby. Thank you. Um... she um... She needs a kidney transplant. Oh, no. She is on the transplant list so we're hoping she gets a kidney very soon. She has a rare hereditary condition called Elport Syndrome. Are you sure you still want to run for re-election given your daughter's condition? Family is my first priority. And there are a lot of families out there going through rough patches worse than what we are right now. And I just want them to know that I'm there for them. Just like I am for little Abby. Ethan Fox, if I can't get you on the news, no one can. Hey. It's coma girl. Still want my story? Uh, are you serious? Yes! Alright, bring all your camera gear. I want this to go viral. Miss Davis. How are you doing today? Uh, Marissa? You're on the news. We need you to come with us. We've got the suspect going down Brodder. Yeah, how far away? Really? Ok, well, thanks again Detective. Thanks for the update. Rose. Are you ok? The stress is getting to me I guess. They spotted her ten blocks away. She gave them the slip but she's still ok. Now she knows we called the police. It's ok, Rose. We're doing the right thing. You know, I think I know something that might help. Yeah, I know. I saw it. Don't worry, I'll fix it. Thomas, excuse me. I'll call you back. Breaking News... Police are looking for Marissa Davis. She recently fled her home and was last spotted in the downtown core. She is mentally unstable and highly unpredictable. Her family released this message: I know you're scared, but you need to come home. I love you. It's only been three years since I lost your father to kidney failure. Hey, could you deliver something for me? It's really urgent. Depends if it's on my route. Uh, yeah. That's on my route. Great. Do you have an extra envelope? Thanks. Please, let me help you. I know you think you're doing the right thing. This story keeps getting better. But you're not well. Oh, that's great. That was Rose Davis. The mother of the missing woman. We'll be sure to keep you posted. Is that you? It sure looks like you. Yeah, it kinda does, huh? Creepy. Make sure he gets it. I'm not sure if you've noticed this, but you're a fugitive! Try not to sound so excited. Are you kidding? This is the best thing that's ever happened to me! I've got cops in my office. This must be some story. Whatever you do, stay away from them. They're just trying to find out what you know. Well, the joke's on them. You've kept me in the dark. You know where I'll be tonight. You sure that place is secure? It's no fortress, but it's discreet. Hey, thanks, by the way. I think you may be the only person I can trust right now. That's when you know you've hit rock bottom. Yeah. Bye. I have something to show you. That's amazing! Cal, you're not thinking. I love you. I love you too, but an unmarried Congressman, a baby on the way? I didn't plan for this either. But you walked into my life. What am I supposed to do? Risk losing you? Out of the question. I followed my heart and I have no regrets. Especially now. Oh my god. I love you so much. And I'm gonna make this right for all of us. You're more beautiful than the first day I saw you. I got your message. And this. God, I missed you so much. I- I lost you, and I had a little girl that needed a mother. And Heather had just lost her baby and the doctor said she couldn't have another, so what was I supposed to do? She begged me to stay with her so that we could raise Abby together. She wanted a baby so much. And then you had the perfect little family. That's how you won the election. How could you do that to me? I didn't do it for the election. I did it for Abby! Listen, she needed a mother. The doctor said he didn't know if you were gonna come out of the coma. And here was this tiny little girl, this tiny piece of you that I could hold on to that was ready to come home from the hospital. And what about my mother? Don't you think she would have liked a tiny little piece of me to hold on to? When she thought she had lost everything? Marissa, your father was really sick. I didn't want to add to her troubles. I still don't know how you pulled it off. How did nobody know that you had my baby? Heather's family owned a clinic, and that's where they took you after the accident. Heather was the one who paid for your private care all these years. She's a saint. Listen to me. Listen! Dr. Novak agreed that Abby would be better off with me than some stranger so he was willing to turn a blind eye to keep the secret. And just how far would he go for that secret? Would he kill for it? What? No! What are you talking about? I love you! I was only doing the best for everyone, especially Abby. Because right now she needs you. She needs us. She's sick. She needs a kidney. I'm not a match but you might be. Marissa, I... I know I screwed up. Would you be willing to take the test? Yes... yes, of course. Let's go. No, no, no. You're all over the news, we can't just walk through the front door. Do you have a safe place to stay until I can make some arrangements? I'll be there tonight. I really need you. I'll be seeing you soon. Police. Miss Davis, Miss Davis, we just want to talk. Open it now, come on! Open it! Clear. Ahhhhhh!!!!!! Oh, my! I said no harm. You're lucky she didn't sustain any head trauma. What does it matter? It's not like we need the brain. Where am I? Just relax. We're just going to run a few tests. What... What? Easy. Tests? For what? For Abby? For the kidney? Something like that. Where is she? Where's my daughter? We'll be right back. Wha... Where's Abby?! Wait! What? Marissa? Sit. A must-see before the election. Care to elaborate? I don't know. Like I said, she told me what to tweet. Now the only story I have is "reporter's reputation dies in a seedy motel room". Are we done here? We're done when I say we're done. What are you doing here? What is this? Say hello to your granddaughter. This is Cal and Heather's daughter. This is the secret Marissa was going to expose. Right before she got nabbed. It would have been a great story. So you believe her? Yeah. Do you know where she is? The police don't have her. Do you know a Peter Vaughn? What are you doing? There's something you don't know. It's Cal. Cal and Marissa were engaged before the accident. Peter Vaughn is Cal's best friend from college. He... he's his head of security right now. Rose, these people, they're dangerous. Maybe you should stay here in case Marissa calls. Ok. Marissa, my darling, what have they done to you? Just stay away from me. Marissa, please. You've lied to me. No, I-I didn't- You told me you were bringing me to my daughter. This is not exactly the venue I had in mind for a mother-daughter reunion. I had nothing to do with this. Marissa, please. I want to help you. I just... I want us to be together. What about Heather? She knows I've always loved you. You're a perfect match. You can save her, Marissa. You slept with her. When we were engaged. I had no choice. What was I supposed to do? It-it was before, it was an accident, I had been... I was drinking. It's ok. You need to go. Marissa and I have a few things to talk about. Please. Go check on Abby. Just go. You weren't supposed to wake up. Our life was perfect. Cal is going to be Senator. We have a beautiful house and a beautiful daughter. My daughter! I want you to know that I love Abby. I love her just as much as I loved my own baby boy. And I will love her just as much after you're gone. I'm not going anywhere. Oh, you have to. You'll ruin everything. It really did work out perfectly. The hit and run. You were there. You tried to kill me. That really was an accident. Please, let me see Abby before you do this. Let me tell her that I love her. You're giving her such a greater gift. The gift of life. And then you will finally go away and everything can go back to normal. Cal is going to be Senator. Maybe more. There is no telling what we can do. How far we can go. Especially with a sick child who is coming back from the brink of death. How are you feeling, princess? Daddy, I'm scared. Don't be scared. You be brave, ok? Ok. Ok. Alright, perfect. I need you to get set up right here. Make sure we get the girl in the shot, please. Ok, we're gonna take that live feed and we'll be on in three, two, one. I'm here at a surgical clinic with Congressman Ward and his daughter, Abby. We've just received word that a new kidney is on the way. Um, yes, thank you, Jake. We're going to televise Abby's kidney transplant, and when she pulls through, the voters will be so elated they'll run to the polls. And guess who they're gonna vote for? You're crazy. Now you're going to go to sleep and not wake up. Bye, Marissa. You don't have to do this. I do love you. I would happily give Abby my kidney, all you had to do was ask! I'm not gonna let you ruin my family. Make sure she's dead this time. Yup. Great. Mrs. Ward? We'd love to get in a quick word with you and the Congressman if we could. Of course. Terrific. This dose is high enough to knock out a rhino. I don't want to knock it out. I want to kill it. Like you killed Lapointe? We have an uninvited guest. That reporter. I need you to deal with him discreetly. Got it. Keep at it. I'll be back. Mmmhmm. Help! Someone help me! You understand? Marissa! Can I help you? That's what I thought. That's good. Much better. What happened to Cynthia? Your nurse? Cynthia? I had to let her go. She was so unreliable. You do know it was her that kept you asleep all those years. But then she wanted out. And here you are. Let's start, shall we? Let's have a little mood music. Aren't the acoustics wonderful? ♪ ♪ Call 911. Medical emergency, Novak Medical Clinic. There's been a murder. Where is my daughter? We are so thankful that the transplant finally came through. Any longer and we could have lost our little girl. And the kidney is on the way? Yes. An excellent medical team is acquiring it as we speak. Damn. Can you tell us anything more about the donor? From what I was told the donor was in a car crash and isn't going to make it. That's why the organ became available. We are forever in her debt for saving our little Abby. Marissa, where are you? Dr. Kravitz, you have a visitor in the main lobby, main lobby. I'm so sorry you're here. My daddy gave it to me. He said it belonged to someone who loved me very much. Do you remember me? Marissa? You're the lady from the school. Mommy says I'm not supposed to talk to you anymore. But I've seen you before. In my dreams. Really? You sang to me. All the time. I have to have an operation. Me too. I'm scared. Can you sing for me now? ♪ Go to sleep my baby, ♪ ♪ go to sleep my dear ♪ ♪ I am right beside you, ♪ ♪ I am always near ♪ ♪ Go to sleep my darling ♪ ♪ Keep you safe and warm ♪ ♪ All your life... ♪ ♪ all your life I'll love you, ♪ ♪ shelter from the storm ♪ I don't feel that scared anymore. That's good, baby. We're gonna get you out of here. You ready? Come on, take this off. Now we just need to pray that her... her surgery is successful. It will be, and she will pull through. She told me that she wants to see her daddy win the election tomorrow. And uh, through the grace of God and the good people of this state, I know her dream will come true. Now, if you'll excuse us, we need to check on Abby. She's gone. I'll miss her. Gone. She escaped. Do you have the kidney? No. Well, she won't go far. There's only one place she wants to be. What's going on? We have a slight problem. You need to get rid of the news team. Please, don't shoot. Marissa, give Abby to me. I can't do that. What are you hoping to accomplish from this? You've lost. Abby will die if you don't give her your kidney. You're gonna come with us and get back on that operating table. Not like this. You know we can just take it. You're the bad guy, aren't you? Abby, come to mommy. Just grab her. This is taking to long. She's sick, Peter. If she dies, Cal gets the sympathy vote. Win-win. Just put that down. Abby? Abby! Marissa! If you love Cal you won't do this. I've done everything for him. If it weren't for me and the sacrifices I made, he never would have been elected Congressman. And he loves me for it. No. He is loyal to you, but that is not love. I suppose he loves you then. Heather, just let it go! Jamie? Jamie? Yeah, yeah, no, no. Listen, can you get me a live feed patched into my phone? Right now. You have ruined my life! Every time I looked at her I was constantly reminded of you! It ends now. No! Heather! Heather! What in God's name are you doing? Daddy! Put the gun down. No! Everything I've done, I've done for you. I'm doing this for myself. Just give me the gun. Daddy! No! Get her! Don't do this, Pete! Sorry, bud. Do not touch her. Heather, I know how sad you must have been to lose Cal's baby. I know. You told her he was Cal's? No, I... it's not important now! Why? I've done everything for you. Everything you've asked. No in, no out. Breaking news. I've got live video feed from Ethan Fox's smart phone. Fox is live on the scene- You better see this! ....Congressman Ward and his family hostage at gun point. I still just don't understand why. Look at him. He could never have been Senator. Abby, come to mommy. Just close your eyes. Cal, shoot her! Does someone want to tell me what the hell is going on? She is like the one-night stand that wouldn't go away. Shoot her! You don't have any feelings for her. Marissa! She's trying to break up our family. You're gonna give up everything? Cal, don't. Cal. Take Abby and go. Everything that we've worked for. Abby, come here. No. Abby? Abby! Cal? Team one in position and locked. No, we're staying on this. Just push in and hold. No! Are you ok? I think so. Is daddy going to be ok? Yeah, he's a big boy. He'll be fine. Is daddy gonna win the election? I don't know. Maybe he will. Come on. Marissa... Marissa? Hmm-mm. Are you really my mom? Yes, sweetheart. I'm really your mom. Abby, I want you to meet Rose. My little angel. Can I have one of those hugs? Yeah. Alright. Alright, I need to get you two to the hospital. Give me one minute. Standing by. Ethan? Hey. Thank you. I never would have found Abby without you. You're a pretty good shot. We're a pretty good team. Interested in becoming a photographer for an intrepid, earnest reporter? Or a bodyguard? Or dinner? I'll get back to you. Your public awaits. It's not over, is it? Your story. I think there's more to tell. Ok, we're gonna take that live feed and be on in three, two, one. I'm standing in front of the Novak Medical Centre, the scene tonight of a violent stand-off involving Congressman Ward, his wife, and a woman who would not give up on her daughter. For Channel 3 News, I'm Ethan Fox.
