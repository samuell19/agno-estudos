What now for the hollow-hearted soldier? When the beast of battle digs in its claws and... a soul sets sail in eternal pause. Survival's true cost is growing older. Where to for the man without a mission? When the cries of combat cease to sound and the ones once brave all lie in the ground. The warrior's new war is attrition. What hope an entire war cherish? To brave a new battle or to perish. - Deklan. - Hm? You wrote this? Yeah. You think I didn't? No, I was just... I was just surprised by how profound it is. You think, uh, soldiers are incapable of being profound? Is that it? You know, I've been calling you for a little over two weeks. I've left you messages, and you've never called me back. Why is that? Uh, I understand. I have a lot of veterans waiting for appointments, not just you. The whole system is swamped. You're lucky you got in when you did. Right. How are you sleeping? Not very good. Well, with all this anxiety, I'm not surprised. Uh, I think we should try a new medication to help you... You know what? You've been pumping me full of medication for over a year, and nothing works. I'm either walking around like a zombie, or I'm punching holes in the wall. I don't have a magic wand. Medications are tools, not solutions. Jesus Christ. Your tools are broken. If you don't change your attitude, things aren't going to get better. - You have to take an active responsibility... - Hold on a second. I am taking responsibility. - Not as far as I'm seeing. - Really? Then what am I doing here? - You tell me. - I'm here because I need help. You think I like feeling like this? Well, then do something about it! Stick with a support group. Reach out to a family member. No one can help you if you're unwilling to help yourself. I am trying to help myself! You shouldn't be allowed anywhere near veterans. Where's the team? We don't have one. We pulled our assets again? For what? Bomb threat downtown. - Again? - Apparently. Avery, we can't go in there alone. Want a coffee? Sure. I'll take a cream and two sugars. I'm not getting you coffee. You're such an asshole. Meet the entry team. Stevens. That's Davis. You guys kick in some doors before? - A few. - Marines. Fallujah. Oh. Appreciate the help. Are you kidding me? Rather do this than write tickets for the next five hours. We still have clearance for this raid? We're clear. Okay. You guys bring enough firepower? We're good then. How bad have you ever wanted to have your fucking cock sucked by a high schooler? Let's fucking do it. Police! Open the door, ice man. Hey! What the hell? Get on the wall! Get on the wall! Get on your knees! Both of them! Give me your hands, motherfucker! Clear! Ready? Go! - Police! - Put it down! Put it down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Don't move! She's dead. Avery! It's all over. Help me! I'm gonna fall! Help me up! You're a fucking cop! Help me up! Help me! Sayonara. Are you all right? What happened? He fell. You push him? "Push him." Come on. Is it her? Yeah. Where's the family? Mom's in Cincinnati. You want me to make the call? I'll do it. You okay? I'm tired. Go rack out if you need to. I'll finish up here. No. I'm tired of this. Hey! Come here! Yeah. Lay 'em on me! Lay 'em on me! Oh! Rough shift? We, uh, had three drive-by victims before lunch. At least they had you there to help them. Yeah, well, we lost two of 'em. No, you saved one. Gotta be proud of yourself. God, I love you. Oh, great. Who invited you to the party? Security! - "Security!" - Don't start with me. Seriously, don't, don't. Go! So when can we expect some little MacGregors running around? Jess! Just asking! Can we get married first before we start having babies? When are you guys having little MacGregors? No, don't listen to her. We are having eight kids! - Eight! - Two. One boy and one girl. You guys wanna get a room or what? - Get him, Mia! - Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no. Now, you know what happens. You know what happens! - Go easy on him, Mia! Please! - Get him, Mia! Take him down! Come on! Take him down, Mia! Take him down! Is this Mrs. Conyers? This is Detective James Avery. I'm calling you with information about your daughter Samantha. What are you wearing? No. Have some respect for yourself. - Wanna meet somewhere else? - No. Have a seat. You guys are handsome guys. Why don't you put on a tie for once in a while? Come here. You're gonna be a dead handsome guy if your dope keeps killing my products. You get that? It's just taking a little while to get the cut right. It's very strong. But we've tripled our profits already. Yeah. We know my clients are a little sick, but nobody's into fucking dead people, all right? You follow me? And could you tell me why Cleveland's finest are finding my holding pens and raiding them whenever the fuck they feel like it? That was, uh, Mike's job. Mike's arrested, right? Dead. Fell off a roof. Oh. That's a shame. Did he have family? Wife and two kids. I want you to pay 'em a visit... and send them my condolences. Cause I don't want anyone talking to the cops. - You get that? - Yeah. And hey. Get me some new product. And un-fuck your dope problem. Don't let anybody say you're not a great chef, Brandon, because that was fantastic, as always. I know. I never question my burgers, man, ever. - Yeah. - Okay. Guys, for you. - Guys! That's so cute. - Aw! You guys are so sweet. Oh, my God! Look how cute we are. Dad was seriously considering adopting you. Did you know that? - Really? - Yeah, I mean, you spent more time with us than you did at your foster homes. Well, it's a good thing he didn't, or Roman here would be marrying his sister right now. - Oh! - Oh, my God. Wow. Wow. Wow. What's up? Are you gonna give them their... thing? What thing? - Babe! - I'm kidding! I'm totally kidding. Okay, guys... Tonight is about you guys. - Jesus! - Come on, guys! I don't wanna hear it! Look, we wanted to wait for the wedding, but... We figured it'd at least cover the cost for the airfare for the honeymoon. - Guys, this is too much. - No! You deserve it. Yup. Okay, well... - I'm coming over. - Oh, yeah. - Oh, I knew it. I knew it. - Thank you so much. All right. Just take the money, Roman. Take the money. Look, Jess and I have worked so hard for what we have. And if you love that little firecracker as much as I love this gorgeous pain in my ass... - I love you. - I love you, too. You're gonna need some money to spoil her with. So welcome to Clan MacGregor! - Yes! - Officially! Cheers. Cheers. - I'm so happy for you, babe. - Aw! Thanks. Now they got you doing the dishes, huh? I didn't know you were here. Nice to see you. - You're looking good. - Thanks! Let me just grab a cup real quick. You're just in time to go to the strip club with your brothers. Uh, I'm not into that. Why not? There's too many douchebags at those places. I end up punching somebody. Come on. Roman wants to spend some time with you. And I wanna spend time with Roman, but I'm not going there. Whoa! Look who crawled out of his cage! What's up, brother? - Hey, man. - How you doing? - Good. You? - I'm good. You look good. Hey, stick around, man. I'll be right back. Gonna jump in the shower. Get clean for the ladies. How are you doing? I'm doing all right. They really miss you. They don't see you ever. Yeah, I've just been, uh... Just been going through a lot, you know? You're coming to the wedding, right? Yeah. I'm gonna try and make it. "Try?" Yeah, I don't wanna tell you that I'm coming and then not show up. Why would you cancel on us? I just told you. I got a lot going on, Mia. I've been through a ton of shit too, but I still show up for my family. Mia, congratulations on the engagement. I... I hope it works out. Relationships aren't easy. What do you know about marriage? You've been divorced twice. I was cheated on twice while I was overseas. I know, and I'm sorry about that. I'm just trying to say don't throw shade on our relationship - when you don't know a thing about them yourself. - Okay. You know what? You're 23 years old. What the fuck do you know about life? Jesus. What'd you say to her? Think the last time we were in here, we were 13 and making out. Brandon locked us in here for, like, three hours. Dad was so pissed. And I was like this close to peeing my pants. It's not easy to talk to Deklan. I know, but we're so nice to him, Roman. We're always reaching out. He just doesn't care. Yeah. Well, we're all he has. And he's hurt. And people who are hurt hurt other people. Look, he's always been there for me when I really needed him. I wanna be the same for him. Even if he doesn't want it. You're so sweet. I am sweet, aren't I? Very much so. I don't wanna have a bachelor party. Let's just... Let's just stay here and watch a movie. It's not a bachelor party. You're gonna go with your brother and stare at naked women. What if I only wanna see you naked? You're gonna see me naked for the rest of your life. Seriously, go have fun tonight. I'm gonna go out with my girlfriends. Okay. Well, make sure you're safe, all right? I think I can handle myself. That is for you. Thank you. This is all for you, man. All for you. - Oh. - Just enjoy yourself. This is supposed to be fun, man. - Come on. Relax! Relax! - I know. I know. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow. Hi! Uh, look at you! - Hi. - Hi. I'm Brandon. This is Roman. This is my brother. He's getting married. - Oh! - I know! I knew that was gonna be exciting! I know! All right. I need you to take care of him, okay? - You don't have to... - No, no. I do. I do. How's that? Is that enough? - I'll take good care of this one. - I know you will. - Come on. - I'm going with... - Yeah. You go, man. - All right. - You go. - All right. Try and relax! Relax! Wow. At least three people, including a Georgian soldier and two Afghan civilians, were killed in a suicide attack on Kabul Province late on Thursday evening. At least 12 others, including three Georgian soldiers, two American service members, and seven Afghan civilians were wounded in the attack. The incident took place late on Thursday in the vicinity of Qarabagh District of Kabul Province. The NATO-led support mission, in a statement, confirmed that one solider... Last but not least, one for the bride-to-be! - Cheers! - Cheers! Whoo! Your boy is crazy, man. He's out of his mind. - Who? - Max! What do you think you do all day? He wouldn't be moving weight at all without you. Doesn't matter. We out? Right after I talk to that. Get my 6:00. Jimmy! Let me in for two seconds, brother. Jimmy. Jimmy. Hey, sweetheart. Who's the lucky lady? This little hottie, she's getting married. Congratulations. - Thank you. - You're too young. You're too young. You should wait till you meet a real man, you know? Are you a real man? Let me show you real quick. I got a... Easy, easy, easy. He doesn't get out much, okay? - I'm just saying. - Let me buy you girls some shots. How 'bout that? We are actually all good. We have a bottle. But thank you guys. Uh... Come on! Be nice. Come on. Let them get a shot. We can help you, you know... Little party more, right? Oh, you... You have blow. Oh, we have everything. Enough to satisfy the whole club. All right, do me a favor, and could you guys please just get out of here? Mia, stop. Seriously, you guys have to go away from our table. Mia, we're being nice. All right. Listen. Come here. Let me tell you... Don't touch me! Ooh! Listen, princess, I'm just fucking around! Don't touch me! - The fuck is wrong with you? - Get out of here! Mia, you shouldn't have done that! You have no idea who they are! Get the fuck off me! I'm cool! Haley, you leave me alone. I've had enough of you tonight. Excuse me. Yeah! It's amazing. Hey, Roman, um... I just wanna see how your night's going. I can't wait to see you. Help me! - Help me! - Fuck, man! Get her in! What the fuck, man? I got it! Drive the fucking car! I got her! Help me! Help me! Okay, okay, okay. I gotta stop. Hey, Roman, um... I just wanna see how your night's going. I can't wait to... Hey, it's Mia. Leave a message. Look, I know. I just think that you're overreacting, bud. She always picks up. She hasn't texted back. Maybe she doesn't wanna be bothered tonight, bro. I mean, she's out having fun with Haley and them. Yeah, and I'm fine with that. I just wanna make sure she's okay. All right? Just... Just drive. I'm driving. What are you doing? - I'm calling Deklan. - Why? Come on. Where do you think she is? That house there. - The white van? - Shh, shh, shh. Damn. I can't hear a thing. You guys need to keep it down while I check this. Okay. I can't wait to see you. Oh, my God! Shit. Brandon, you got your piece with you? - Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Lock and load it. - What's going on? 911. What is your emergency? My sister's been abducted. - What? - Okay, sir, what's your location? We're just down the street from where she's being held. The address is 1424 Walker Street. There's a white van parked out front. - What are you talking about? - And what is your name? - Deklan MacGregor. - Fuck. Okay, sir. Stay calm. Officers are on their way. - Sir? - There she is! Hold it! Roman! - Lay down. - Get on the fucking ground! Get on the fucking ground! - It's not Mia. - It looks like her. It's not her! Whoa. Whoa. Hold on. He moves, you shoot him in the head. What? Roman, you good? Yeah, I got him. Jesus Christ. Hey. It's okay, all right? It's okay. Go on. Get out of here. Hey. Hey. Come on. I'm here to help you. Come on. - Show me your hands! - Show me your hands! So we can see 'em. That's it. Keep your hands up! Walk towards us! Walk towards us slowly! Slowly! Very slowly! Get on the stairs! Stop right there and turn around! Keep your hands up! It's gonna be okay. He drugged me this whole time. Put your phone number down there. I'll call when I have information about your sister. I'm gonna do everything in my power to try and find Mia. - What does that mean exactly? - I'm sorry? What are you gonna do? We start by entering her name in a national database. It goes to the FBI, DEA, Highway Patrol, the US Marshalls. Yeah. Does that work? - Excuse me? - Is it successful? You and your brother Brandon were in the Army. Right? Ranger battalion? Where'd you deploy? Detective, are you investigating me or the people that took my sister? You're not a suspect. Why aren't you out there right now? You see what these shitbags do? They're experts. They move victims around all the time. They switch holding locations. They move people around. It happens. Let law enforcement... Law enforcement do what? I know you're not a stranger to violence. You're not in Iraq. You can't go around in Cleveland kicking in doors. Some of the investigators here, they'll charge you guys with all kinds of garbage. I don't wanna be the guy that's gonna put you in jail. After this, I can't protect you. You need to let me focus on finding your sister. I'm gonna do everything I can to try and find her. - That's a promise. - Okay. Thank you. Good luck. Boys, let's go. Come on. Fuck! What are we gonna do? I don't know, Rome. Yes, you do. We gotta let the cops do their job. They're not gonna find her, Brandon. We don't go looking, she's as good as dead, and you know it. I'll do whatever I need to do. You guys just tell me what to do. Like what? What are we gonna do? We go to war. We treat it like any other hostage recovery. We were just arrested. - Fuck. - Hey. Hey. I love Mia. Look at me for a second. I love Mia, you know that. But I can't leave Jess without a husband. That's it. What if it was Jess out there, Brandon? Don't do that. Do what? - Don't guilt trip me. - I'm not guilt tripping you. I'm asking you an honest question. What if it was Jess out there? Wouldn't you do everything in your power to get her back? Of course I would. But you don't understand the position that I'm in. Of course I do. No. You don't have a family to lose, Dek. Mia's our family. This is our family. Yeah. What do you think Dad would do, Brandon? Hm? I don't care if I go to jail. I don't care if I die. I'm not stopping until I find her. I need your help. I know, man. I know. Good. Come here. - We'll find her. You hear me? - Okay. Let's go get you cleaned up. Hey! Hello? Can you hear me? Hey! Let me out of here! Hello? Hey! Hey! Can you hear me? Let me out of here! I said let me out of here! I'm gonna kill you if you don't let me out of here! You get a tox back? I rushed it for you. Pharmaceuticals? Fentanyl? Carfentanyl. Never heard of it. That's because it's not made for humans. It's a synthetic OP tranquilizer used for large animals like horses, elephants, rhinos. 10,000 times more powerful than morphine. And they're cutting it into the heroin supply? We've had 30-plus carfentanyl OD cases all over the city in the last three weeks. Brooke, call Narcos. Find out what they know about this drug. Yeah. Okay. She's 18. What is this? Her hand. Most likely a bone fragment. It feels like plastic. I doubt it. What is that? Okay. Okay. Thanks. The girls the MacGregors rescued... Have we heard from the next of kin? No, not yet. But we do have the girls in protection. Anything on the missing girl, Mia? Nothing. What is that? They've been tagging these girls with GPS trackers. Pieces of shit. Here. Narcos said nothing about it? No, actually they're tracking a large influx of carfentanyl into the city. Well, good. Where's it coming from? Almost all of it's seeping in through one organization's territory. Who? Guy named Max Livington. - You fucking with me? - You know him? I've been working on him for two years. Haley. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. Why are you here? - You can't be here. - It's okay. It's okay. Hey. What happened to you? I called your phone like a thousand times. Why didn't you answer? He told me I can't talk to anybody. What? What are you talking about? Who? Who told you this? Hey. Come here, come here, come here. These are my brothers. This is Deklan and Brandon. Watch yourself, okay? I'm so sorry. - I didn't answer my phone. - Haley. I didn't know what else to do. It's okay. Haley? Hey. Hey. Who did that to you? They're gonna kill me. No one's gonna hurt you. We're gonna get you out of town, somewhere safe. All right? Now, what happened to Mia? She got in a fight with two guys at the club. They run girls. They run you? No. I... I strip. They come to the strip club and try to find johns. That's how I know of them. They kidnap these girls? Is that what they do? From what I understand, no, they don't have to. They hang out at the soup kitchens and women's shelters and look for broken girls who don't have anywhere to stay. Hey! Hey, come here. Come here. Don't be shy. You're too hot to be freezing out here, man. Don't break my heart. Come on. Let me take you to dinner. Let me take you to dinner. I know you're hungry. Come on. Hop in. They pretended to care about her, bought her all this fancy jewelry and clothes, and got her hooked on all these drugs. Yeah. Right here. And then it was too late. They... They turned on her. This is John. And I'm gonna ask you to fuck him. On the... Yeah. What happened to her? She tried to run. And they found her. This crazy guy, ugh, he gathered up a bunch of the girls and made them watch as he poured lighter fluid on her. No! No! No! No! I talked to her a couple days later in the hospital and then... I guess somebody found her in Lake Erie. Okay, but why my fianc?e? Huh? Why Mia? Because she disrespected them. Haley, I want you to hear me. We're gonna punish the people that did this to you. But I need to know who they are, okay? Can you do that for me? - Yeah. - Yeah? I don't... I don't know their names, but I could show you a picture. Okay. Good. Here. Tell you what. Bring that over here. Let me see. - You know where I can find them? - Yeah. You heard from Max? No. I hope he chills out soon, man. Don't worry about Max. Let me worry about Max. "Let me worry about Max." You said that last time. You gonna kill yourself one of those days with this. Hopefully. Your cousin's gonna be famous. Nah, man. Did you watch the game yesterday? No, I didn't. I just wanted to watch it for him. Yeah, he's balled out. He's been balling, man. It's cool. - Dude's like... - Hey! Hey! Can you hear me? Oh, yeah. I'm gonna kill you! You have to let me out of here! Wow. She's got some fight. Let me out of here! I said let me out of here! Don't touch me. Please let me go. I swear I'm not gonna tell anyone. - Mm, mm, mm. - Please. I'm gonna have fun with this one, bro. Come here! Where you going? Fuck! I swear to God, you're gonna have to kill me. Oh, yeah? Am I? Get off me! Oh! Fuck! Ah! - Whoa! Slow down! - Let me go! - Whoa! Slow down! - Let me go! Let me go! - Let me go! - Slow down! Whoa. Oh, God. You're gorgeous. Hmm. - And she's feisty, too. - Get off! Get off! Somebody shut her up! Shut her up! I haven't seen her before. Where did you get her? We picked her up from the... the White Horse Club. The White Horse... Why would you pick someone up from there, huh? Look, man, you said you needed product. I said I needed product, but not product that's gonna blow up the missing person report or the Amber Alert. It's not as bad as you think, Max. Honestly... You're telling me that the products are dying, and the police are raiding my spots whenever the fuck they feel like it... and you idiots are grabbing girls out of local areas in front of fucking cameras? We picked her up from a blind spot in the alley. No one saw a goddamned thing. I know how you did it, but you don't do it at all. Okay? Shoot 'em. Wait. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Hold on. Max. Max. Max. Max. Max. Max. - Whoa, Richard! - Come on. Come on, man. Come on, Max. I'm sorry, man. Max, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what? I got something a little bit better. Give me the gun. She's gonna shoot 'em. Untie her. Come on. Come on. I take it that you've never killed someone before. All you gotta do is take your finger, put it in the trigger. Come on, Max. It's actually real easy. You take your finger, and you point it right here. - Come on! - Wait. Wait. Wait. Max! Max. Take your hand right here, and you put it right there. Come on, Max. Listen... and you listen close. I want the girls off the dope. We're gonna dump this product in Vegas. We're gonna start off fresh. You got me? And if you lose another one of my fuckin' products... I'mma cut your fuckin' nose and your fuckin' ears off. You understand me? Yeah. You're more trouble then you're worth. You know that? Against the wall. Hands against the wall. See that? Stay there. Stay there! All right. Give me your hands. I'd love to hump you. Go ahead when you're ready. Okay. What you're doing right now is you're bobbling the punch. So when you come up, you wanna go from here, straight out. One, two, three. Here, then punch. Up, straight out, then you ride the front target. It's not about speed. It's about control. Slow down. Easy. There we go. So when I move, you move. When I stop, you stop. Ah-ah. Now you're in the line of fire. Roman, I want you to take a picture of Mia and put it in your mind. And then forget about yourself. This is all about her now. - I love you. - I love you, too. You bring her home. Of course. What's this joker doing? Oh, hell, no. Something must be wrong with my sight system. Avery, how are ya? Is your secretary deaf? Well, she is, actually. I don't even know why she answers the phone anymore, but I've found it hard to fire her. I'm serious. I've been trying to get ahold of you. You have any idea how many people try to get ahold of me in a day? - I told you. I need evidence. - This... is carfentanyl. You can only get it by mail or robbing a zoo. It's an elephant tranquilizer. I'm tracking their push into the system. All originating from this one guy. Max Livington. That's great if you're trafficking, not dope. We recovered ten trafficking victims who had this drug in their system. You think this guy's the ringleader. Had two victims ID him. Pretty sure I can make it stick. Well let's get our shit together and bring this guy in. - Sir? - Seriously. It's good fucking work. I'm gonna run it up the chain. Get your boys together. Let's bring this asshole in. Avery, wait! Do me a favor. Pop a few rounds into that target. I think my system's off. You're an asshole. Wha... What do we got here? Vince and some of his guys got rolled up by some wetwork crew. - Who sent this? - Don't know. Wanted to make sure you weren't cleaning house before I reacted. I didn't order the hit. I should've ordered the hit on that stupid motherfucker. Listen, I need to beef up on my security. I don't want no crackheads. I don't want no tweakers. I don't want none of that shit. I want some real guys that know how to use real weapons. You understand me? I'll see what I can drum up. I need to find out who owns that truck. I don't care if it's the FBI. I don't care if it's the DEA. You need to find them and make a motherfucking example out of they ass. Now. Ah! Hey! Time to wake up, Vince. You lifted a girl by the name of Mia from a club the other night. Huh. Now I wanna know where she is. You guys are ridiculous. You know who I'm talking about? No. Roman. Oh, yeah. How could I forget? She's long gone. Gone to a place where they're gonna use her all day, every day, for the rest of her little life. You son of a bitch! - Who the fuck... - Hey! Hey! Easy! Easy! Hey. I'm gonna give you one last chance. Where is she, Vince? Doesn't matter. Because the guys I work for, they're gonna find you, and they're gonna find you and you. And they're gonna kill everybody you ever cared about, even if you do find your girl. And they're gonna find me, and they're gonna cut me up. So it really doesn't matter! I wouldn't do that to you, Vince. See, you gotta understand something about me. I don't like hurting people. But the C4 that's strapped to your chest? It doesn't give a shit. It's a little excessive, boys, huh? And away we go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay! Start talking. Okay, I'll tell you where she's gonna be tomorrow. I'm sure you can. Okay, look, look. Look, look, uh... My boss... He's closed up shop here in Cleveland. He's moving all his product to Vegas. - Give me a name. - Your girl's gonna be there. Give me a name. You got 20 seconds. I'd choose your words wisely, Vince. Max. His name's Max! - Max? Max? - Max. His name's Max! Start packing up. Max what? - Wait, wait, wait! - All right, I'm listening. No, no, no, no, no! Okay! Okay! Look, look, look! Please stop! Max Livington. Max Livington! Shut it off, man! Please! Come on! Shut it off! Where is she exactly? At the trainyard, in a basement, in a warehouse on, on, on... Fuck! On 44th Street! On 44th Street! You're gonna take us to her. Yes, I'll take you to her! Come on, man! I'll take you to her! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off now! Now! Fucking... She better be there, man. If you touched her, I swear to God... She's there. I swear. Look, you gotta let me out though. I can't come in with you guys. No, you're gonna take us to her. Fuck! Goddamn it, man! - Clear! - The fuck is she? To the left, to the left, to the left. Which fucking room, man? The one to the right. Up ahead. Fuck! Shit. - Where the fuck is she? - I swear to God she was here! She was here! She got out! Dek, she got out! Move! Hey! Hey! Get out! Hey! Hey! Please, stop! Stop! Go! Go! Drive! Just drive! What's happening? Please. I've been kidnapped. Just go. Drive faster. Please. Where's your phone? We need to call the cops. I don't have a cell phone. Um... I'll take you to the police station, how's that? Here. Put this coat on. I got some boots down there if you need 'em. Everything is gonna be okay. Let's go! Move! Get off me! Get off me! No! Get off me! I can't believe you're pulling this shit on me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Pump your brakes. This is not my call. This is coming from way above my head. Apparently your boy made a deal with the FBI and the DEA. He's not getting charged with anything? He's gonna give them every major trafficker in Cleveland and Chicago and most of the players in Vegas. That is some bullshit. What am I supposed to do now? They don't wanna treat the symptoms on this. They wanna kill the disease. He is the disease. Look, the orders are to pull all surveillance on this guy. Get your informants out. Everything. It's not your problem anymore, all right? Make sure everyone's out of the way, you got it? And Avery, you did a good job on... Fucking God. You okay? What do you got? Someone just attacked one of Max's top officers outside a bar in the warehouse district. Have you been helping them? Maybe I should be. What they're doing is illegal and dangerous. I know. Look, it's a homicide. They're gonna get arrested. All right? Do you wanna do it, or do you want them to get caught by somebody who doesn't give a shit? Find him. Bring him in. Hold on. Okay. Okay. Dek, we gotta get him to a hospital. No, no, no, no. No hospital. Just get me home. You can patch me up there, okay? Fuck. It's Jessa. Leave a message. Hey, Jess, uh... We're on our way back, okay? I got hit, but I'm fine. We're about five minutes out. I love you. Bye. Fuck! Come on. - Come on. - She... Don't... Come on. Come on. Get him out of here. It doesn't matter. It's not up for discussion. It's not up for discussion. As soon as you can, grab your brothers and get in my squad car. I wish I had some good news. But I don't. You guys are gonna be arrested. I can't stop that. We just missed Mia. She escaped. They have GPS trackers on all these girls. Soon as she got out, they knew exactly where to find her. You know this guy? Is that Max? Yeah, it's Max. How do you know Max? A pimp told us that they were gonna be shipping girls tomorrow from the steelyard. Apparently everybody this guy owns is being shipped to Vegas. That's tomorrow? We heard from our informants it was happening, but not a date. Well, that's what he said. Can you do something about it? Max made a deal with the FBI. He's rolling on everybody on his Rolodex. You mean this piece of shit is gonna walk? I can't touch this. We can. Look, all I want is just a little bit of time. All right? Think about the lives that you're gonna save. Twenty-four hours. Let's go. - This is my fault. - Don't say that, Roman. - It is! - Don't even fucking think it! Maybe you should sit this one out, you know? Just take some time to grieve. - Grieve? - Yeah. We don't have time to fucking grieve. They just killed my wife. There's nothing I can do about that, but we are not losing another member of this family. Brandon. Hey. Brandon. Hey. Hey. Come here, Bran. Come here. Come here. Hey. You're fine. Come on. Let her go. Jess wouldn't want us to stop now, okay? - Come on. Come on. - Yeah. Yep. Yep. Let's go get these motherfuckers. Can you help out a little bit? Let's go. Keep it moving! Keep it moving! Contact! Get 'em out of here! Get 'em out of here! Get 'em out! Come on. Hit the top. Hit the top! The hinges are loose! Come on! Hit the top! Ah! Doors. Come on, baby. Come on. Let's go. Move! Okay. Mm. Oh, yeah. I love you. Now. Come on. Let's go. Thank you. Give me your hand. Yeah, give him your hand. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Here, here, here. Bite this. It's okay. It's okay. Tweezers. I got you. Come here. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I love you. Okay. I'll see you again. Listen, Mia. We broke a bunch of laws to get you back. Now we've been working with a detective, and he's gonna come by the house in a little while. Gonna take us to the station. And as long as we keep working with him... then he's gonna try to get our sentence reduced. All right? Get the fuck down! Get 'em out of here! Move! Move! Hey, guys, grab the carrier vests and put them on now. - Now! Roman! Come on! - Yes! Yes! - Okay. - Yeah. Brandon! Fucking God! You got it! You got it! I got you! Okay? I got you! Get down! Get down! Get down! Go. I'll cover you. Go! Go! Go! All right. You're good. Oh, it's okay. Jesus. Give me the gun. Give me the gun! Watch him. Shit! Damn it! We need more bullets! Mia. Mia! Go check that room right there. No! Oh, Brandon! Come on, man! No! Baby! Baby! Baby! You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. It's all right. I'm sorry. Brother, when you raise your shield, so will I. Sister... when you charge at the enemy, so will I. And if death awaits us, calling his warriors home, let me go die smiling by your side. For we are family. What the hell is this? - Asshole. - Oh, stop it. - Go fuck yourself. - Avery! Avery, come on! Motherfucker. You think you can fuck... - Hold on! Let me grab Brandon! - Yeah! - Come on, Brandon! - Come on! Get in it, guys. - Everybody. - All right. You ready? - Ready? We're gonna take a family picture. - Smile! - Can I have a kiss? - Look at the camera. - Look at the camera! - Hey! One, two... Subtitles by explosiveskull
