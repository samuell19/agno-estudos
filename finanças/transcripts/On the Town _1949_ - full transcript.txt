Hey, fellas! Hey! Hey, fellas. Aren't we gonna do any more sightseeing? I never been any place but Peoria. I wanna take in beauties of New York. I wanna take them out. Back where I come from... all the dames are covered with coal dust. Wow. Get a load of that. - Not bad. - Not bad? Get him, Mr. Particular. Who you got waiting for you, Ava Gardner? I'm gonna take my time until I find me a real New York glamour girl. I got a line that mows them down. In Meadowville, I land the cream of the crop. Meadowville? You may be a big shot in Meadowville... but don't forget the whole town could fit in that manhole over there. - Yeah. And so could you. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hey, fellas. Break it up. We're wasting the day. Can't we pick up dates... and go sightseeing at the same time. Look, 10:30, the Aquarium. Then, 10:45, the Na... Sure, why not? Ozzie, I got the whole day figured out. - 10:30, "Hello." - Oh, hello! - 10:45... - Hold hands. - Eleven o' clock. - Shall we dance? - 11:15? - Our first kiss. 11:30? Come on. Let's get the subway. Pardon me, sir, but how do I get uptown? Well, let's see. If you wanna go to.... And there you are. I beg your pardon. Is this the uptown platform? Now, it all depends.... - You get that? - Yeah, thanks. Come on. - So, what'd he say? - So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin... I will not work overtime no matter what. If it's the bookkeeping accounts or you." - So, what'd he say? - So I said, "Listen, Mr. Gadolphin... you make just one more pass at me and yours truly is passing... out from the Grand Illusion Girdle Company." - And what did he say? - So I said, "If you..." Hey, one side, fellas. - Say, what are you doing? - Putting up a little artwork. There. Miss Turnstiles for the month of June. - Huh? - "Meet lovely Ivy Smith." Gee, a real New York glamour girl. - A debutante. - She must be pretty important. - I won't say that. - What do you mean? - Her picture's all over the subway. - Like it says... they pick up a new Miss Turnstiles every month. Excuse me. Hey, look, "She's a home-loving girl... but she loves high society's whirl." "She loves the Army but her heart belongs to the Navy." "She's studying painting at the museums... and dancing at Symphonic Hall." Gee, she's wonderful. - A celebrity. - Yeah. What a girl. She can do everything. Look what it says: "Meet lovely Ivy Smith. Every month some lucky little New York miss is chosen... from the thousands of girls who ride the subways... to be Miss Turnstiles." She's got to be brilliant... beautiful... talented. Just an average girl. This month the fortunate lassie is Miss Ivy Smith. - Who me? - Yes, you. Though a celebrity... Miss Smith is a home-loving girl. But she loves high society's whirl. She goes out for the Army. But her heart belongs to the Navy. She studies painting and dancing at Symphonic Hall. She's a frail and flower-like creature. But, oh, boy! What an athlete! - Gee, what a girl. - Hey, cut that out. - Gabe. - Come on. Let's get out of here. Hey, put that back, you guys. - Why did you do that? - I want the picture for my collection. That's all you'll have for your collection. Who knows? Maybe I'll meet her. Impossible. There are four million women here. It'll take you a million years to find her. Why, the law of averages says... Miss Smith, act like you're putting a coin in a box. Out of the way. We're taking a picture here. Why don't we get a sailor in the picture? Stand here. Now, just give him the dime, and you put the fare in the box for her. Hey, you're... Aren't you Miss Turnstiles? - How did you know? - Well, I saw your picture in the subway... - You mean you saw my picture... - Yeah. - Oh, that. - Oh, gee. I'm flattered you liked it well enough to take it with you. - How's that? - Fine. Drop the dime in the box, sailor. Hold it. That's all, Miss Smith. Thanks. - We're proud of our boys. - Thanks. I'm terribly late now. I have to run. Goodbye, sailor. Thanks for posing with me. Hey, wait. We'll head her off at the next station. - What? - In a cab. Why do you run after girls all the time? I'll tell you when your voice changes, junior. Hey, Oz, come on. - Taxi. Taxi. - Sorry. No more fares today. - I'm turning in the cab. It's overdue. - Oh, please, mister. Hey, he's a girl. What are you doing driving a cab? The war's over. I never give up anything I like. Get in. - The subway station. - It's right over there. - You too weak to walk it? - No. The next one, uptown. Oh, all right, but only if he gets up front. All right, Chip, get up there. Get in there. - No. - Come on. Get going. What's the matter? You out of your mind? - What's got into you? - I ran into her. You said it couldn't happen and I ran into her. - The law of averages, huh? - What became of the jive that mows... them down, the Meadowville Special? Didn't have a chance. Watch when we catch up with her. - Hey, lady, faster, please. - Yeah, come on, lady. For you, anything. - What's your name? - Oh, Chip. Chip, huh? Bet you can't guess mine... That's ridiculous. There are over two million... - girls' names registered... - You win. - It's Esterhazy. Brunhilde Esterhazy. - Well, pleased to meet you. - Why don't you come up to my place? - What? Look, Chip, I've been waiting for you all my life. I knew you the minute I saw you. You're for me. I like your face, it's open. You know what I mean? Nothing in it. The kind of a face I could fall into. - Kiss me. - Please, Miss Esterhazy. Call me Hildy. Why don't you ditch these guys... - and come up to my place? - Look, lady, I hardly know you. I've only got one day in town. I want to see the famous landmarks. - Stick with me, kid. I'll show you plenty. - Hey. Hey, here it is. Oh, yeah. Columbus Circle. Hey, Esterhazy, what are you doing here? Oh, hello, Spud. What's on your tiny mind? Don't sweet-talk me. This cab is due back in the garage. Bixby's waiting. Get in there or I'll have to report you. Okay. Okay. - We must have just missed the train. - Taxi. Taxi. Taxi. Come on. I'll bet we find dozens of glamour girls at Grant's Tomb. - Sure. - Taxi, anyone? You don't wanna waste your day looking for one girl. - Taxi, taxi. - And besides, Gabe... you got the picture. When we get aboard ship... - you can hang it up in a locker. - Hey. The picture. Look, fellas, it's full of clues. - If I follow them, I'm sure to find her. - What? She's gotta be at one of these places. - We can track her down easy. - Gabe, what's happened to you? I don't know. All I know is I gotta find this girl. Get your red-hot taxis here. Wait a minute, fellas. I don't want to spoil your day. - You guys go ahead. - What's it say on the card? We do this systematically we can find her in hours. - Sure. - It says she's studying painting... - in the museums... - Museums? - Well, come on. Let's try it. - Well? Here I am. - Where's the nearest museum? - Museum of Anthropological History. Okay, let's go. Only if he gets up front. - Okay. - What's the big idea? I knew you'd come back. They all come back. Well, how much do we owe you? Never mind. Let's run it up a little. I'm coming in with you. This unique skeleton is the result of 20 years' unceasing labor. This dinosaur roamed the earth six million years ago. Let us move on. Oh, excuse me. Don't be frightened, lady. They're all dead. Hold it. It's fantastic. I've simply got to get the two of you together. Oh, my dear, you are priceless. Thank you. How about some cheesecake? What a lucky girl I am. I've simply got to get your measurements. Oh, I'm Junior Miss, size 11, very high-waisted. - Gorgeous. - Hmm. Now, it's my turn. Oh. Oh! Stop. How dare you! I was only playing, lady. - What you doing tonight? - Now, just a minute. I want you to know that my interest in you is purely scientific. Huh? I'm a cold-blooded scientist and I'm writing... an anthropological study for this museum. It's called "Modern Man: What is it?" - The name is Claire Huddesen. - Pleased to meet you. I took you picture because you look exactly... like this pithecanthropus erectus... a man extinct since 6,000,000 B.C. I look like that? - I look like that. - Oh, now, don't be moody. You made an understandable mistake. And now the head. The sub-super-dolichocephalic head. Oh, sailor, I love you for having that. Gee, all my life I wanted someone to love me for my sakidophalic head. - Don't be bitter. - There aren't many of us left. We had a sakidophalic class reunion last year. Not many of the old faces around anymore. Well, that'll be all. You can go now. Hey! How come a girl like you is interested in this anthropo... Whatchamacallit? Well, you see, it's this way. I've been running around too much with all kinds of young men. I just couldn't settle down. So my guardian suggested... I take up anthropology. He thought if I made a scientific study of man... I'd become more objective... get them out of my system... be able to control myself. Oh, has it worked? Almost completely. Ahem. I was just asking this lady if she knew... - where I could find Miss Turnstiles. - Yeah, of course. And I was just doing a bit of research. Dr. Kinsey, I presume. Oh, no, really, I was just telling your friend.... - Ozzie. - Ozzie, what a remarkable... specimen he is an exact throwback... to the pithecanthropus erectus. Hey. Hey, look. She's gonna put me in a book. - Holy smoke. - How about that? Yes, you see, there are all too few modern males... who can measure up to the prehistoric. Modern man is not for me The movie star and Dapper Dan Give me the healthy Joe from ages ago A prehistoric man What has Gable got for me Or Mrs. Johnson's blond boy, Van I want a happy ape With no English drape A prehistoric man Top hats, bow ties He simply wore no ties Bearskin, bearskin He just sat around In nothing but bearskin I really love bearskin Some guys care a lot for me But my excitement they can't fan Because I still await my primitive mate We've had a date Since the world began My prehistoric man No psychoanalysis He never knew what made him tick He never paid it seems For telling his dreams Poor prehistoric Dick Jitters, jitters He never had jitters No repression He just believed In free self-expression I love self-expression He had honest calluses He never worked to pile up dough So unlike you and me No ulcers had he Simple and free in the long ago Poor prehistoric Joe Bebop, bebop They didn't have bebop Tom-toms, tom-toms They sat all day Just a-beatin' on tom-toms I really love tom-toms Tom-tom That's good! Hey! - Hey! - Hey, nice. Great job. I liked that. - Watch out. - Are you knocking it down? - Hey. - What are you doing? Hey, we better get out of here. Come on. Yeah. Come on. - Hey, come on, let's go! - Yowee! Come on, come on. - Calling car 44. - That's us. Report to Museum of Anthropological History. Investigate collapse of dinosaur. - Collapse! Why, that's terrible. - Why? She's my favorite singing star, that Dinah Shore. Gee, the professor at the museum seemed miffed. How'd you feel if someone broke your dinosaur? I never had one, we were too poor. Well, can I drop the three of you someplace? No. We're all helping Gabey find Miss Turnstiles. Yeah, let's try all the other museums. We're sticking with you. We don't give up that easy. Well, neither do I. At least I'm catching up on my culture. Where do we go from here? She might be at the Symphonic Hall Building. - Symphonic Hall? - Yeah. Wait a second, I wanna get something straight. You're all gonna go to the Symphonic Hall Building? - Yeah. - If Ivy Smith isn't there... - you're gonna go someplace? - Sure. - And then someplace else. - Yeah. And you guys have to be back on the ship at 6:00 tomorrow morning? Uh-huh. Well, it seems to me if we split up, we'd get farther. I mean, we'd get farther looking for her. I mean, we'd keep looking but we'd look... in three different places instead of the same place. Yeah. Maybe Hildy and I could go to the subway people for some information. - Yeah. - That's a splendid idea. Ozzie and I, we could look Miss Smith up in the social register. - I have a copy at home. - Yeah. Yeah. That sounds practical. - Yeah. Very practical. - We hate to leave you alone, Gabe. Yeah, I know you do, kid. It's breaking your heart. - Well, shall we go? - Come along, specimen. - Well, we'll all meet at 8:30, huh? - Okay. Where? Top of the Empire State Building, all right? All right, 8:30. We'll see what we can get done till then. - Well, so long. - Good hunting. - Well, which way do we go? - The way of all flesh, junior. The way of all flesh. - Well, I guess we pulled that off. - Yeah. I'm glad we're alone. - I'm glad you're glad. It's about time. - Well, where will we go first? - Huh? - We're alone. You can take me on that sightseeing tour of the city. I was afraid you'd remember that. Okay. A quick tour of the city, then up to my place. No, then we gotta go looking for Gabey's girl. No, then up to my place. - Where do you wanna go first? - Well.... My grandpa told me, "Chip, my boy There'll come a time when you'll leave home If you should ever hit New York Be sure to see the Hippodrome" - The Hippodrome? - Yeah, the Hippodrome. Did I hear right? Did you say Hippodrome? Yes you heard right Yes, I said the Hip... - Hey what did you stop for? - Lt ain't there anymore They tore it down You know a dozen years ago - I wanted to see the Hippodrome. - What year is that guidebook anyway? - 1905. - 1905! No wonder! Don't you realize a big city like this changes all the time? But there's one thing that doesn't change, kid. - Come up to my place. - No. My grandpa saw the girlie shows And told me of one special pearl He said the hottest show in town Was called The Florodora Girl - Florodora Girl? - Yeah, The Florodora Girl. Did I dig that? Was that Florodora Girl? Yes, you dug that That was Florodora... - What stop for did you hey? - You may not see that play That famous girlie show Closed 40 years ago - Come up to my place - No My grandpa said I'd see New York In all its beauty and its power From the city's highest spot Atop the famous Woolworth Tower - The Woolworth Tower? - Yeah, the Woolworth Tower. Hold the phone, Joe Did you say the Woolworth Tower? I'm still ringing Yes, I said the Wool... - Did you stop for hey what? - That ain't the highest spot Since that old guidebook date They built the Empire State - Come up to my place - Let's go Cleopatra's Needle - Let's go to my place - Let's see Wanamaker's Store - Let's go to my place - Let's go to Lindy's, go to Luchow's Go to my place Let's see Radio City And Herald Square - Let's go to my place - Go to Reubens' - My place - Go to Macy's - Go to my place - Go to Roxy's - Go to my place - Cloisters, Gimbels' - My place, my place - Flatiron Building - Hippodrome - My place. Well, this is it. My little palace. I see, it's really homey. A swell view too. Yeah, on a clear day, you can see the back yard. Come on. Put your bundles down. Make yourself at home. You know, Hildy, I feel that we ought to really try to find Miss Turnstiles. Look, Chip, we tried before. - Yeah, we did try. - Sure. - And we'll try again later. - Sure. Much later. Let's try this first. Well, as long as we tried. Lucy! What on earth are you doing here? I'm sorry, Hildy. I just couldn't go to work today. I've got an awful cold and I didn't know you... Of all the days you picked. Chip, this is my roommate, Lucy Shmeeler. - She's a grand girl. - How do you do? Hello, Chip. I'm sorry. I've got to inhale. Excuse me. Think she will stay under there long. Sure, sure. She will be under there for days. Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Oh, you know, Hildy, this is just like taking a picture. If I had a camera, I could get the two of you together. You could do that by just leaving the room. Oh. Come here. - Is that you, Chip? - No. I've gotta get some gargle. - I got the gargle. - Well, I'm very glad to hear that. Lucy! Would you mind stepping into the other room? - What for? - I'd like to go over some figures. - Figures? - The rent, Lucy. The rent. Hildy, we paid... - I'm going out. - With that cold? I'm going to an air-cooled movie. - Hildy says... - It'll do you a world of good. - Yes, it will. Yes. - Thanks, Lucy. I'll do the same for you someday. When will you ever get the opportunity? - Goodbye, Miss Shmeeler. - Goodbye, Mr. Chips. Hark! Ah. The nightingale. The tawny... But I don't wanna be like Margaret O'Brien. Shh. Now, be quiet. You just wait until I get you home. Are you gonna audition for Grab Your Spats? No, I'm only interested in classic ballet. Pli?! But, madame, my parents in Meadowville are so proud of me. They're so thrilled that I'm Miss Turnstiles. Second position. I know that being Miss Turnstiles means nothing... but they think it makes me an important person. It'd be just terrible if they found out I'm working as a cooch dancer. Third position. Me, I will not breathe a word on them about this... unless I must write them about payments. - Oh, Madame Dilyovska. - Fourth position. Remember, you are fortunate girl. You study with great Dilyovska who has taught everyone... from Nijinsky to Mickey Rooney. Fifth position. I will make you big star. I am best teacher this side of the hall. And now... my special exercise for the balance, the upside down frapp?. One, two, three, four. - Good. Good. - One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. - Very good. - One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. - One, two, three, four. - Pardon me, my dear. - Three, four. - I will be gone a short while. - Keep practicing. Practicing. - One, two, three, four. - One, two, three... - Practicing. Yes, madame.... Four. One, two... Clumsy mariner, look where you're going. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. One, two, three... - four... - Hey! - A gentleman should always knock. - It's you, lvy Smith. - And what if I am? - I knew I'd find you. Don't you remember me? I'm afraid we haven't had the pleasure. Well, I'm the sailor who posed with you on the subway. Oh! Oh, of course. I dimly recall. One meets so many people. Yeah, yeah. I bet you do. Well, if you'll excuse me. I'm busy. Listen, lvy. You know, it was funny, me bumping into you like this. I just happened to be passing Symphonic Hall and I said to myself: "Gabe, my boy." That's my name, Gabey. "Why don't you drop in and look at the girls." I had an hour to kill so I thought I'd give some lucky little chick a break. If you play your cards right, it could be you. What in heaven's name are you driving at? Well, I'm a pretty special guy and you're a pretty special girl... why don't you and me do some fancy stepping tonight. Take in the swank spots. You know, El Morocco... Stork Club, Roseland. How about it? Of all the uncouth nerve. Leave at once you... You, sailor, you. - Don't get excited. - Of all the insulting lines. Do you think I'd go out with any sailor I've never even seen before? Please. Leave at once. I'm very busy. I have a singing lesson upstairs and I've got to change. Okay, sister, it's your loss. Look, I wanna apologize for everything I just said. I thought I'd pull that fancy line on you but it didn't work. Well, I didn't just drop in here accidentally. I've been looking for you all day, ever since I met you. - Really? - Yeah. And then... finding you like this I guess I lost my head. I threw that stuff at you because I thought... it was the only way I could impress a big celebrity like you. You probably got millionaires, society guys... running after you all the time. Oh, yes. By the droves. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry I bothered you. I guess I'm a little out of my depth. Us small town guys must sound pretty silly to a native New Yorker like you. Oh, yes. When one is a native New Yorker... small towns seem so provincial. Back home in Meadowville, Indiana, we don't get to meet girls like you. - Meadowville? - Yeah, did you ever hear of it? Oh, no. Well, I probably learned about it in geography. Oh, I doubt that. The population's only 18,000. Well, that's not so small. I mean, they're all people... - just like anyone else. - That's right. I think a small town's all right. It's nobody's fault if they're born there. - Sure. - We big city folk must never forget... the small towns are the backbones... - of the American civilization. - Hey! That's just the phrase Miss Hodges used in my American History class. Oh, did you have Miss Hodges? I mean, Miss Hodges... - is such a funny name. - Yeah. Well, I... Well, tell me more about this place, Meadowville. - You really want to hear about it? - Yes. Well.... There's not much to tell About my hometown Life is easy and the tempo slow But if you really want To find what's in it You'll learn in a minute All you have to know Let's go Come walkin' with me I want you to see our Main Street You'll know the whole town By just walkin' down our Main Street There's the corner Where the boys hang out As each girl goes by they rate her Whistle and try to date her Later. Baby are you goin' steady? And then we can stop And chat with the cop On Main Street He made an arrest way back in 1903 He'll ask me "Who is the pretty stranger?" How proud I'm gonna be When you walk down Main Street with me How proud I'm gonna be When you walk down Main Street with me. Gosh, Ivy... I mean Miss Smith. I... Do you think that...? Would you go out with me tonight? Oh, no. I'm afraid a date is quite out of the question. - I'm busy. - One of your rich boyfriends? Oh, yes, one of them or other. But how long are you going to be in town? Oh, just today. I gotta be back on the ship tomorrow morning. Oh. - I'd love to go out with you tonight. - What? I have a big society party to go to, but I'll break the engagement. - You will? - Yes. - Oh, gee, shall I come and get you? - Oh, no. I'll meet you. - Oh, good. Eight-thirty? - Eight-thirty. - What is here going on? - Oh, Madame Dilyovska... - I beg your pardon... - Is this tar a friend of yours? - Well, not exactly. - Leave at once, young man. - Well, goodbye. About 8:30. - Eight-thirty. On your way, bell-bottom. Oh, Madame Dilyovska, I'm going out with him tonight. Where!? We forgot to say where. Top of the Empire State Building. - Oh, but it's so high up. - Oh, it won't seem high to me. I'm in the clouds right now. You will not keep that date. You will be at your job at Coney Island tonight. - But, Madame Dilyovska, just this once. - "Meadowville, Indiana. - Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith:" - What are you doing? - I am composing letter to your father. - Oh, no. I will be at Coney Island tonight at 12. And if you are not there at that time, I shall regretfully have to mail it. Oh, Madame Dilyovska, you wouldn't do that. - Why not? - But I have to meet him. I'll leave him at 11:30. You would better leave him at 11:30 or: Hey, look, there's Grant's Tomb. I could see it just like in the pictures. Let me see. It says it was built in 1897... and more than 15 million people have seen it. How do you like that? Hey, hey, this thing's quit. You got another dime? What do you want a dime for? You can see me for nothing. Oh, I got one. Gee, look, there's Symphonic Hall. And it's so close too. You know, Hildy, I feel kind of guilty about Gabey. He's my pal and he looks after me. I mean, maybe we should have looked for lvy Smith. Here we go again. I tell you, we never could have found her. Yeah, I guess you're right. There's the George Washington Bridge. And the Music Hall. Gee, why didn't I come up here sooner? I wasted my whole day away. Thanks a lot. Gee, Hildy, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Go on, get back to your telescope. You two make a lovely couple. I don't wanna look through the telescope. - I'd rather look at you. - Whisper sweet nothings in my ear. Like the population of the Bronx or how many hot dogs... were sold in the last fiscal year of the Yankee Stadium. Please, Hildy, don't be mad. I like you. I think you're very pretty. You're the prettiest cab driver I've ever seen. Tell it to your guidebook. It means more to you than I do. There. Chip, you care. Why didn't you tell me? Gee, I don't know. I'd like to whisper sweet nothings. Those words that everyone knows But my thoughts get mangled And all the words get tangled But since you ask me, here goes You're awful Awful good to look at Awful nice to be with Awful sweet to have and hold You're nothin' Nothin' if not lovely Nothin' if not dazzling Nothin' but pure gold You're frightening Frightening me when you say That you might go away You're boring Boring into my heart to stay You're cheap, dear Cheap at any price, dear Cheap for such a diamond Cheap for such a pearl What I said before I'll say again You're awful Awful nice to be my girl You're old, dear Old with worldly wisdom Old like Gorgonzola Old like vintage French champagne You're so-so So, so kind of charming So, so kind of witty So I can't explain Can't stand you I can't stand you to give Some fellow the eye Can't see you In the arms of another guy Who needs you Needs you to distraction Needs you till he's crazy Needs you rain or shine - I'm the one who needs you - I'm the one who needs you - And I think you're awful - And I think you're awful - Awful nice to say you're mine - Awful nice to say you're mine Chip. - Yowee! - Hey, Oz. How are you? - Man, where you been? - Wow. What a view. Oh, glad I didn't join the Air Force. Did you find Miss Turnstiles? Uh, not exactly. - But I looked. - Yeah, I looked too. - Yeah. - Yeah. Well, tough luck not finding her. This must be the place. - Gabey. - Hiya. - How are you? - How are you? As if they hadn't seen each other in years. - Hiya, Claire. Hiya, Hildy. - Hi. - Well? - Well.... Gabe, I tried to find her. We looked all over. But let's face it, the town's too big. Sure, sure. Say, what's the matter? Did you get into a fight? - How did that get there? - You know, Gabe, I saw her too. - Yeah? - Yeah, just for a flash. - Where? - In Yonkers. Yonkers. - Yonkers. - A lot of photographers around her. Yeah. Just had a quick flash and then I lost her. - The town's pretty big. - Too big, yeah. - Too big, yeah. - Yeah. Look, fellas, don't worry about me. I'm all booked up for tonight - Yeah? Nice girl. - Sure. - Ivy Smith. - No. Miss Turnstiles? - What are you trying to put over? - So help me, I found her. She ought to be here any minute. - Hey, look. Cops. - Duck, everybody. I'm sure he's up here, that sailor. Looks like the statue of pithecanthropus. Come on, we'll take a look around the building. - Hey, that's my boss. - Here, try these for size. - Do you recognize the other guy? - The professor from the museum. - He seems to be looking for someone. - Guess who, specimen? Oh.... Hey, what am I gonna do? I've gotta hide. Where am I gonna hide? - There's no hiding place up here. - Come on. My dinosaur, ruined. He broke it. Look. Sailors. - Having fun, kids? - Yeah. Swell view from up here. Do you happen to know another sailor? - A fella who goes to museums? - Museums? Please. Sailors got other ways of studying natural history. You haven't seen another sailor hanging around here, have you? Oh, no. No, we haven't seen anyone hanging around here. - What's the matter with you? - The altitude. It makes me sleepy. Professor, this sailor was at the Museum of Anthropological History... - today about 11:30? - Yes. - You're sure of this description? - I'll never forget him. He has black hair, blue eyes, about 5'11" tall... looks exactly like the statue of pithecanthropus erectus, exactly. We're looking for three sailors and a lady cab driver. A lady cab driver? Oh, how revolting. Claire, did you ever...? You haven't seen him? Come along, Tracy. I guess they're not up here. Awe-inspiring, isn't it? Majestic, that's what it is. - It does a man's soul good to... - Come on, Tracy. Oh. What's the matter, fellas? Lose something? - Poor darling. You brave thing. - Why didn't you get rid of them sooner? All these hours in the air. I could get my wings. You can also get a striped suit. Let's go. - No, I gotta wait for Ivy. - Ivy? I don't believe you met her. - Where is she? - I don't know. She had a big society affair tonight. Maybe she had trouble breaking it. Society affair? What does he think Miss Turnstiles is? Oh, he thinks she's a big celebrity. Why tell him she's nobody? It's his one day in town. - Oh, I get it. - Let's get started. I don't know what happened to her. She promised me she'd be here. - Ivy. - Gabey. - Oh, I'm sorry I'm late. - I thought you'd never get here. I had a lot of trouble breaking my engagement... - but I'm glad I did. - Me too. Oh, well, here she is. Miss Turnstiles. - Well, what do you know, it's really her? - Ivy, this is Hildy. Claire. Ozzie. Chip. lvy Smith. Ladies and gentlemen, we're off on a lark. I've got one suggestion before we embark. There are lots of nice things to do in the dark... but let's not go rowing in Central Park. We're going on the town - New York - New York - We're riding on a rocket - We're riding on a rocket We're gonna really sock it Because tonight's the night We're goin' on a toot We're goin' to raise a riot The Brooklyn Bridge, we'll buy it And hit the heights tonight Get high as kites tonight East Side, West Side, round the city One day, one night, that's the pity But we won't look ahead Or let the light of dawn Get us down We're really living Jack We're goin' on the town Stop, fellas.

We love it more than we can say How nice We get lots of good fresh air The ocean is everywhere That's why we hate to get leave And go away It's just so touching Hear them say Hate to get a leave and go away Hate to leave the ship Where life is play All the livelong day Just think what we could be doing today. We could be swabbing the decks Sweeping the bunks with a broom We could be shoveling tons of coal Down in the boiler room Got news We got those shore-leave blues It's just so touching Hear him sob He wants a pretty little deck to swab Polish up the railings and the knobs Poor unhappy gobs Oh, we got news We got the shore-leave blues Especially me. I miss the chow. And that's not all my friends Just think of this Travel. Adventure. See the world. The Navy The Navy Absolutely nothing does it lack And in the morning Tomorrow morning They'll have to come And drag us back On a spree On a tear We're going north, south, east, west Everywhere We're goin' on the town We're kickin' back the traces We're gonna do the places We've never done before We're goin' on the loose We're blowin' all our dough in And we'll keep right on goin' As if no one before Had any fun before Hot spots, swank spots Roofs and cellars Three smart girls And three slick fellers We're gonna paint it red We'll fill 'em up And then drink 'em down Let's have a ball tonight We're goin' on the town - Looks a wee bit crowded. - Leave it to me. Hey, waiter. Table for six, please. Best you've got. - I'm sorry, sir. We are all filled up. - All filled up, huh? I hear that's what they always say in New York. Well, count, you better start scraping and bowing now... because the lady I have with me is none other than Miss Turnstiles. - Oh, Gabey, please. - Miss Turnstiles? - What are you talking about? No room. - You heard me. Miss Turnstiles, for June. Ivy Smith. What is this, Miss Turnstiles? Go away, sailor. - See here. - You heard him. Hey, Fran?ois. - Yes? - Build us a table, will you? I'm sorry, madame. There are no tables. Of course, madame. A table, surely. Gar?on, table. See that girl over there? Make a big fuss over her. - Miss Turnstiles. - Miss Turnstiles? What is that? Never mind. Just make a fuss. Go ahead. Oh, Miss Turnstiles, we are so proud and happy to have you here. Please come in. Our humble establishment welcomes you with wide open doors. There, you see. It worked like a charm. Oh, it was nothing, really. Gosh, this is a great table, huh? Yeah. Hey, those girls are pretty. Well, folks, what will it be? Say, what's in this? "Explodo Bomborino," sounds good. Four kinds of rum, brandy, grenadine, lime juice, papaya juice... the white of one duck egg. Only 12 to a customer. How about this one, "Dreamland Nightmare"? Vodka, champagne, prune juice, floating chopped chives... - He'll have a beer. - Yeah, beer all around. Pardon me, madame. Oh, I'm sorry. It was an accident. I didn't really mean to sit on your lap. I hope you all aren't hurt, but I was pushed and... Scram. Hey, look. Look out. Here she comes again. - Where are those drinks? - Here you are, folks. Ah. Just what I wanted. A mug of solid glass. That's all there is, folks So good night to you We hope you liked Our Sambacaba?a Revue Come on, let's dance before the stampede starts. All right, specimen. Let's go primitive. Just a minute, Ozzie. - Oh, Fran?ois? - Yes, madame? Champagne, compliments of the house? Oh, yes, madame. With pleasure. Compliments of the house. Luckily we got leave when we hit here, otherwise... Champagne for Miss Turnstiles. Compliments of the house. Oh, thank you. Isn't that nice? Gee, that's terrific. Gosh, I guess this happens to you all the time, wherever you go. Oh, yes, on and off. Well, what shall we drink to? Let's drink to New York. New York. You know, it must be so exciting in the Navy. You go all over the world from one big city to another... you see all kinds of strange places... you meet all kinds of girls. Yeah, well, when you only spend a short time in some place... you don't wanna get too involved with any one particular girl. I mean, you might never see her again. Oh, of course, it's best to just have a good time... and not think about tomorrow. Yeah, when we push off tomorrow... I guess this'll all seem like a dream. That's why I think it's silly to get too involved, because.... Oh, I know. Getting involved it's so... So involving. Yeah... Hey. Oh, Ivy. Wait. Don't tell us.... You were just asking this young lady where you could find Miss Turnstiles. - Look. Champagne. - Yeah, the guy just come over and said: "Champagne for Miss Turnstiles. Compliments of the house." - Gee, real champagne. - Yeah. Not cream soda, not celery tonic but real champagne. Oh, this is great. I've never had champagne before. Ozzie, if you say the bubbles tickle your nose, I'll drown you. - Well, let's have a toast. - All right. This one's for the boys. Here's to the girls we found in the great big city. And this one's for the girls. - Here's to being found. - Oh. That's all there is, folks So good night to you We hope you liked Our little Dixieland Revue Come on, let's dance. Dance? We'd just go out and get crushed to death. What a way to die. Ivy.... I didn't mean what I said about not getting involved... with a girl I may never see again. - No? - No. This isn't just one of those things... where a sailor picks up a girl for just one day. I have a feeling I'm gonna see you again. Oh, Gabey, I'm so glad you said that. I know you're glamorous and famous, lvy... and maybe you came along tonight just to be nice to a guy on leave... Oh, that's not true, Gabey. I came along tonight... because I wanted to be with you more than anything else in the world. - Honest? - Yes, Gabey. Oh, then I know we're gonna see each other again. In the meantime, we have the whole night ahead of us. - It's only 11:30 now and... - Eleven-thirty? Yeah, what's the matter, lvy? Oh, Gabey, I don't know how to tell you this but... Ivy, what is it? Oh, Gabey, I've something to tell you. Hey, Gabe, Gabey. Hiya, Gabe. Hey, Simpkins, Kovarski. Say, they're two guys from my ship. - Gabey... - Ivy, I want them to meet you in person. Wait here, I'll bring them over. - But, Gabey... - I'll only be a second. Hiya, fellas. How's the big town treating you? - Not bad. Not bad. Daisy, Ella, Gabe. - Hello, girls. How's the Meadowville menace? Mowing them down? Fellas, I hit the jackpot today. Nothing much. Just the most famous girl in New York. Who you with, the Statue of Liberty? Twice as famous, Miss Turnstiles, for June. - Yeah? Who's that? - Who's that? Are you kidding? - Her picture's up all over the subway... - Yeah? Where is she? Right over here. Come to the table. I'll introduce you. - Excuse us, girls. We'll be right back. - Excuse us. The grass is always greener, if you know what I mean. Hey, how'd you meet a dame like that, anyway? Magnetism, boys. Sheer magnetism. She was drawn to me. She must have gone to powder her nose. - She'll be back in a... - Oh, sure. Yeah. I'll introduce you later, fellas. - Gabe. - Oh, I just stepped out for a bit of air. - Yeah, we read the note. - Oh. - Too bad, Gabe. - What'd you mean, too bad? As a matter of fact, I'm kind of relieved. You know these famous gals, so stuck on themselves. Who needs them? I'm on my own, I'll have me a real time. So long, girls. See you back on the ship, guys. Wait, why not stick with us? You could get another date. - No. - Claire will get you a date. - How about a girl for Gabe? - I don't know any girls. Wait, I can get you a date. My roommate, Lucy Shmeeler. - What? - She's a nice girl. She hasn't been out in years. - She's swell. You'll like her. - Yeah, you'll like her. How about it? I can go call her now. Sure. Why not? The night's young. Come on. We'll paint this town pink, green and yellow. - Get in there. Come on. - Yowee! That's all there is, folks So good night to you We hope you liked Our little Shanghai Revue - How you doing, Gabe? - Great. Not thinking about that Miss Turnstiles, are you? Who's that? Never heard of her. Bottoms up. Where's that heavy date you promised me? - What's keeping Miss Shmeeler? - I don't know. She should be here. When I told her about Gabey, she's out of the house before I hung up. - Playing hard to get, huh? - Well, where is she? Hello, Lucy. Hello. Oh, hello, Chip. Well, now we've all got dates. Lucy, this is Claire. Oh, don't tell. I know. I'll bet you're Gabey. No. He's the lucky fellow. The luck of the lrish. - Won't you sit down, Miss Shmeeler. - Oh, thank you. Thank you. Yes. Gesundheit. That's the nicest thing anybody ever said to me. - Here. You got a cold, huh? - Oh, it's just a little sniffle. Nothing a ton of penicillin won't cure. But it's not catching. No, not even if you get real close. Come on, Hildy. We'd better dance. Let's go, Claire. Have a drink, Miss Shmeeler. Oh, I don't mind if I do. You know, I was planning a quiet evening at home... but when Hildy called and said that the Navy was in distress... well, I just flew. Hildy can tell you I'm just a streetcar named lmpulsive. - Well, here's to... - Here's to us. My, that's strong. - Did you see The Lost Weekend? - See it? I feel as though I was in it. I mean until you came along, Lucy. Oh, that calls for a real toast. - Let's pretend this is champagne. - Champagne? Yes, and we'll do the real old-fashioned champagne toast. - Now, let's interlock arms. - No, really... Oh, come on. It's so Viennese. - Hey, Gabe. - Hiya. - Gabey... - It's a small world, eh? - Hello, fellas. - How about that introduction? Oh, go away, guys. Can't you see I'm busy? Give us a break. We wanna see the most beautiful gal in New York. We wanna meet the little bombshell. - Come on, fellas. - Oh, Gabey, you're smothering me. - Hello? - Hello. Hello. Miss Shmeeler... this is First Class Seamen Simpkins and Kovarski. - Pleased to meet you, miss. - Yeah. We've been looking forward to this. It'll give us a lot to talk about back on the ship, won't it, Gabe? - Yeah. - Well, so long. Bye-bye. Magnetism, that's what it is. Sheer magnetism. - Goodbye. Oh, they're sweet. - Yeah. Excuse me a minute, Lucy. I gotta get some cigarettes. I don't think Gabey's very happy about this. - Amazing. Amazing deduction. - Hey, look. Drinking alone, partner? - We don't like that around here. - We don't cotton to it no how. Looks like you're trying to ditch us, partner. You can't get away with it. Reckon you're stuck with us. Yep. We're your pals, pal. Oh, when you feel downhearted You must remember this Things never are As bad as they could be When friends have all departed There's one you'll never miss I'll be right with you You can count on me Yeah. You can count on me As the adding machine once said - "You can count on me" - Oh. If you committed moider And got caught like a dope And had to hang Until your life was done I'd holler: "Go no foider Boys, fetch another rope" I'm hanging with him, I'll stick to you, son - Yeah. - L'll stick to you, son - I'll always be beside you - I'll stick to you, son - We'll go through life together - As the flypaper told the fly: "I'll stick to you, son" Yeah. Stick to you - Stick to you - I'll stick to you Oh, if you miss your mother A million miles from home Oh, think of how you once Clung to her knee Although there is no other On land or sea or foam When you're in town, kid You can cling to me Ah! Cling to me - Cling to me - You can cling to me. Ah! If through a lot of foolery You lost your last red cent - I wouldn't even stop to ask you why - To ask you why I'd pawn my mother's jewelry I'd steal my sister's rent It's all for you, kid You can milk me dry You can milk me dry As the cow to the farmer said "You can milk me dry" If on an island We two were cast astray I'd make it into paradise indeed If rescue came you'd only Shriek at them "Go away" Because you'd find That I am all you need I am all you need As the dough told the pastry cook "I am all you knead" I am all you need As the dough told the pastry cook "I am all you knead" You can count on me Feel free to count on me You can count on me I mean count on me As the adding machine once said, "You can count on..." Two, four, six, eight Who do we appreciate? You can count on me. - This is where I live. - Oh. Oh, it was very nice of you to take me home. That's all right, Lucy, and thanks. Would you come up for a minute? No, I guess not. The others are waiting for me. Besides, I'm not very good company tonight. I guess I showed you a pretty dull time. Oh, no. I had a marvelous time. At last I have something to write in my diary. I've been using it for laundry lists. No, really, I'm sorry about tonight, Lucy. You know, somewhere in the world, there's a right girl for every boy. I guess I found the one for me before I even met you. I tried... but I can't forget her. But don't you worry. You'll find your guy. You're a nice girl, Lucy. - Good night. - Oh, you bad boy. Now, I won't wash my cheek for a year. Good night. "A Day in New York. A comedy in three acts." - Hey, Gabe. - Oh, hello, Chip. I got kind of worried that you wouldn't come back. Well, thanks, Chip. I'm okay. I know how tough you're taking this, Gabe. I know you know. That's why I love you. Come on. When I danced in lmperial Palace before czar... he wept, tears streaming on floor. I had to do next number in galoshes. - Madame Dilyovska. - What is it? - Oh, Miss Smith's young friend. - Madame Dilyovska, where is she? - Who? - Ivy. Ivy Smith. She went to a society party. You know where she is? Big society party. This party is at Coney Island... - the playground of the rich. - Coney Island. At Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk. - I know where she is. - What's she doing there? - I don't know. - Let's go. I know the shortest way out. - We'll get there fast. - Let's go. - If I don't get my cab... - Look over there. - That's them. - That's the cab. Hey, you, stop. Hey, fellas, where's the fire? We're the fire. Hey, it's them. They're after us. - Who? - The cops. - Hildy, step on it. - Okay. Hildy, they're catching up with us. I can see their faces. It's no fun for them. They can see yours. - Do you think we can lose them? - I know a place across Brooklyn Bridge... - where no one will find us. - What is it? Brooklyn. Ozzie, get up there. You can see better. Are they close? Any closer and we'd be chasing them. - You better go faster. - Hurry, Hildy. - Give her the gun. - Hold on. Calling Shore Patrol. Calling all police cars. Coming off the east end of Brooklyn Bridge. - Heading east. - Okay. Let's go. Wow, we just picked up another one. - We're losing them now. - Losing them? - They're multiplying like schmoos. - Pull into that fruit stand. I wonder who's minding the police station? Pearl of the Persian Sea Will you come to me? This is Tilyou Avenue and the Boardwalk. I wonder what she's doing here. - It doesn't look like a big society party. - Shut up, Chip. Inside, we feature Princess Yvette... the girl who picks up the handkerchief with her teeth. Ivy. Gabey. All right, step up. Step up. - Ivy. - Keep away from me. Keep away from me. Well, now, you know everything. Here I am. Miss Turnstiles, the famous celebrity. This is my big society party. What are you doing here? Ivy, why did you leave me? I thought I'd never see you again. I had to come to work. Don't you see, I work here. That's what I do. I'm a cooch dancer. I have to work. I owe Madame Dilyovska... money for my lessons and I have to pay her. - Excuse me, I have to go on now. - Ivy, I don't care about any of that. I don't care what you do. All I care about is that I've found you again. Ivy, I thought I'd lost you forever. Why did you run away? Because I couldn't tell you about this. I lied to you so much. Did you think that would have made any difference? And Madame Dilyovska threatened... to write what I was doing to my parents in Meadowville. Meadowville? Meadowville, Indiana? Yes, I'm from there... and I had Miss Hodges for American History too. Holy smoke. Did you hear that? She's from Meadowville. - No. - Well, that explains everything. Oh! - The cops. - Ivy. You're on. I gotta hide. Where am I gonna hide? Oh, where have I heard that before? Come on. We'll comb the joint. Hey. You girls see any sailors back here? - Sailors? - Yeah. Who'd notice a sailor with you around? - Say, you're pretty cute. - So are you. Get out there. Make with the wiggles. We gotta sell some tickets. Ah. Come on, follow me. Dance, dance, dance. Come on, this way. Sing. Pearl of the Persian Sea When will you come to me? Across the desert sands I wait with outstretched hands Pearl, pearl of ecstasy Wait for me. - Ah! - Let's get him. Ah! I wonder what she wouldn't do. They're all yours. All right. Nobody leave. I'm taking you to Night Court. - The rest stay for questioning. - Where are the boys? Shore Patrol took them. It's the brig for them. They didn't do anything. - You can't do that. - We haven't said goodbye to them. - Little one, don't get upset. - Just a minute. We got a right to know what the charges are. Oh. So you wanna know what the charges are? - Yeah. - Well, first of all, speeding. Stealing a taxicab. Destroying a dinosaur. And in general, disturbing the peace of our fair city. What? For that you separate three sailors and their girls... without allowing them a goodbye kiss? For that you throw three kids on a one-day pass in the brig? Speeding. Ivy... Ivy, tell them why we were speeding. Well, Gabey thought he'd never see me again. - There, there. Now, there, there. - And your dinosaur. Why, professor, you ought to feel proud about that dinosaur. - What? - You ought to feel proud... that three sailors from the U.S. Navy... got off the ship for one day and what did they do? Were they thirsty for hard liquor? No. They were thirsty for culture. Were they running after girls? No. They came running to the museum to see your dinosaur. For months out at sea they were dreaming about your dinosaur. Is it any wonder that seeing it face to face overcome by emotion... that one of them fell against it and broke it a little? Why, I'll bet if that dinosaur could speak... he'd say what any public-spirited citizen would: "For the Navy, anytime." Ray. And the cab. We didn't steal it. It was my last fare for the day. And the biggest fare this cab company has ever had. Two hundred and eighty-seven dollars and fifty cents. And why did I keep this fare all day, ladies and gentlemen? Because I know my duty toward the servicemen. There was this one. He was... He was just a little fella. A skinny little runt. He kept pestering me and following me around. I couldn't shake him off. And finally, he kind of got under my skin. You would have done the same. He wanted to see the beautiful sights of our beautiful city of New York. And I showed him plenty. And what do you think these boys think now of our New York hospitality? Where's our civic pride? We should have hugged them and said: "Boys, the town is yours." How about the speeding? As a matter of fact, they weren't doing much over 35. They were crawling along at a snail's pace. They were practically going backwards. Just a minute. Folks, it's quarter past 5... and these kids have just got time enough... to get down to the ship and say goodbye to the fellas. Now, I want to see some action, and I'm gonna start it. Come on. Three cheers for the Red, White and Blue Say hooray for the Red, White and Blue I feel like I'm not out of bed yet Oh the sun is warm But my blanket's warmer - Gabey. - Ozzie. - Ivy. - Hildy. Sleep, sleep in your lady's arms Hey, come on. - New York, New York - New York, New York New York, New York It's a wonderful town New York, New York It's a wonderful town The Bronx is up And the Battery's down The people ride In a hole in the ground New York, New York It's a wonderful town The Bronx is up And the Battery's down The people ride In a hole in the ground New York, New York It's a wonderful town
