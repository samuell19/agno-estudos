You don't tidy it up, either. You're living in the same shit, like us. But this is not the problem. I tell you the problem. Who is it? I have never seen Emel under or on me. You were always behind me. In the dark. Who are you? What's your motivation? Money. Money. Money for all of us. Actually you... Fuck! - Film? - Which one? Before dying... Celal! What's up? You miss me so much? Come here. Wait a second. What is? - I gotta tell you something. - Alright, you will. - I gotta tell you something. - What is it? I need to introduce somebody. What? Who is he? What happened? I were packing my stuff, after you left. Somebody knocked the door. I opened it and... It was him with his pizza in hand. Good day! Your pizza! - I didn't order it. - But I cooked it myself. Get in! Get in in! - Where are the chicks? - What? Chicks! No no! Hands up. Hands up! Is it real? What if it's fake? Very small. Fuck! Drop the gun! Drop it! Don't look! Don't! Move! Move! Who the fuck are you! Talk! Talk! She is lying. She is lying. I'm just a pizza boy. There was an order in morning. Somebody ordered pizza. She ordered mixed one. I brought it. She opened the door. Let me get inside. She tied me up. Then I saw leg of the man. She said that he's sleeping there. However she killed him. You motherfucker! You killed Kenan! You are so fucked! Where the fuck is Kenan! Where is he? What the fuck! Where is he? -He is in the bathroom. She carried him to the bath. Why don't you tell him? Don't touch me! What am I gonna do? He loved Kenan so much. Do I regret killing him? Do you know, you are fucked up? You killed my friend He was my friend My brother... Was everything to me... He was me. You fuckin' killed me You think I'll let you live.......while he is dead? Celal don't! He hasn't said anything yet. He's a dead man anyway. Let him talk first. Are you fucking with me? Look at me fucker! I'm gonna fuck you ultimately. You better talk yourself. Get it? Give me the answers now. Who sent you here? Nobody. This is my job. Who the fuck sent you! Who is your boss? I have no. Who did give you the orders? - Mr. Kadir - Who is Kadir? Our boss Mr. Kadir. Kadir ordered you... In which region is he dominant? What? Which area? Etiler. For how many years have you been in this job? For 2 and a half years. How much do you earn? 25.000.000 25.000.000? Is it enough for you? No, it's not. But there is no other way. I deal with it... Did you kill me for 25.000.000? Am I worth just 25.000.000? I'll make you my dog for that price. - I will fucking kill you! - Don't get it wrong. I'm just pizza boy. I'm working there. There is the pizza on the table, look if you don't believe me. I tried to explain, but you don't listen to me. I'm not a pizza boy, she said. But I really am a pizza boy. In the morning... I went to the shop. They sent me here for an order. This woman... wanted a mixed pizza. I got here, she drew her gun. Tied me here by force. Then... I saw his legs. She said me, he was sleeping. Somebody called and she got outside. I saved myself from the rope and get there. Your friend were lying. I saw, she killed him there. Yes, she killed him. Then she carried him to the bathroom. I am not to blame. Do you hear what you are saying? Why would I trust you? If I trust you, this means, she is lying. If she is lying, I gotta kill her. - Think again. Phone! Call them and ask! The number's on the pizza-box. Ask them, if Murat Isbilir works there. Bravo! Excellent story! You are great! If we call there, they will tell you, that Murat Isbilir works there. Because he really works, he got the orders in the morning, and delivered it. Somehow he disappears, because somebody replace him. (I don't even understand what she is talking about) And that man comes here. Knocks the door with this gun in hand. With the gun, he killed Kenan. You killed the real pity pizza boy with this gun, huh? Tell me! Abdullah (Apo) sent you to kill one or all of us? - Who's Abdullah? - Very smart of you. I almost believe you! You are lying. -You killed him, you're lying! - How old are you? - 18. 18, huh? You're living fast. Where were you man? - The fucking world is ours man! - The world is there. Take care of me a little. Put your ass up! The boss is here. I'm telling you, Abdullah is here. Get that? The boss is here man! - The boss! - Fuck! Don't fuck yourself. Let's go. Very nice. You get the things square! After all you have time to have a good time! You tell yourselves, this is great work! I call here, they tell me... "If you don't have reservation, you can't get in." They say it to me! - This is your place, pap. We are working for you. - You cook very well. Everybody pays millions of liras for them. It's your right to spend the money you earn. You give degenerated parties with whores and gigolos. Pap? There is a tea party next week? You don't wanna come? I cook the pasta. You love them! Pap look. We are in deep shit, This work is always risky. We always pay the blank side. - We just decided to have fun. - Ofcourse you should do that. I hope you wouldn't forget to invite your fathers. I bring my aunt then. Only experienced ones can cook well. This is harder than beat the drums. This requires more ability than fucking a girl. This woman will cause you to lose everything. If you think about that, you won't regret. Give the whores up! White Abdullah's lawyer is hanging here, too. The girl is beautiful, but with the wrong guy. As the saying goes, bears eat the best pear. Look at that. You should shoot the balls slowly. Alright? The goal is to tuck all the balls in. After all the balls are tucked in, there should be one ball left. - What's happening? - I don't know. Now I'm on the black. Black is the most important one. It should be tuck in in the end. After you tuck it in... The game will be over! Let's go. Goodbye guys! The black... It is always the most important one. How long will we stay here? I'm sick of this place. We should get the job. There are tiny problems. If we solve them, it's done. What problems? The biggest, most important one. Abdullah. Fuck you. This is an utter betrayal. You won't mess with him, huh? Yeah, this is kind of unpleasent, but... How long do you think we should take care of him? We are the ones who do the legwork. But he gets the cream. He always gains the profit. However he is just an old dog, alright? We always find something new. And what's he doing? What's the hard hat doing? He hampers us all the time. You want more meat? Look, guys like us leads the world now. Young, dynamic and political men. We are businessmen, and he is just an old hard hat. There is no country for the old men. We have to do everything. And if neccessary... I think it is... It has been the time to finish him. We must be the bosses! We must be! Kenan meatball or meat? We should utterly betray him then. Betray to who? To Abdullah. He... made us. He gave everything he had. We have all we need. Sometimes we were disobedient, killed his men, stole his smacks. Now you think Abdullah won't kill us? What will he do? We restrained him, does he have any men around him? We should behave radically! We should take the head now! This is just a rule. I don't get involve. You whatever shit you like. - Can I go, too? - Go fuck yourself! You haven't learned it yet. Killing men, robbery... these are just nick nacks. Trust, fidelity, loyalty are hard. However you choose betrayal in the sake of money and power. Remember! There is no end in betrayal. If you begin to betray, you gotta stab every single one in the back. In the end it will be your turn. If you don't value somethings, you will be homeless in this world. You can't do business. You will keep the rules! You respect me! Because I am the rule! I make the decisions! Who the fuck are you! Who is Celal? You break into my house, kill my men and sabotage me! If you don't shoot me now, I will mince you and feed you to my dogs! Fuck off now! Microbe! Right, microbe! Mr. Celal couldn't come, but he gave me something. You dog! If i were you, i won't even think of it. Get out of our way now. Alright?... Godfather.
