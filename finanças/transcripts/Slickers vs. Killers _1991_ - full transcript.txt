Nobody cared for me when I was a kid. Dad had his business, mom wanted entertainment. I went to a boarding nursery school. So you've had your education. Yes. But the teacher, she was making fun of us. How? She was deliberately reversing all adjectives. If something was large, she would say it was small. And if it was sharp, she would call it blunt. Then, in primary school, two years younger... Two years older, right? Right, I'm confused again. So, my classmate's mom died. We all went to her funeral. There I said... "We're all so happy that your mom's alive." Your classmate must've been very angry. No, he said that he was also very happy. But his friend was angry. How about you, tell me about yourself. I wanted to be a psychologist. I understand how people think. That didn't happen, so I became a salesman. I'm a successful salesman, because I understand my customers. That's bad. You mean, that's good. I can't get rid of this good habit. Bad habit... Anyway, doesn't matter. What's the problem with you? - I have no problem. - What's wrong then? The problem is that everybody thinks I have a problem. They say I'm acting ridiculously at times. In other words, you don't mean what you say. Me, a salesman, I can't say what I mean. A good salesman should be good at lying, believe even his own lies. You don't have a problem. I don't care what others think. But my wife also believes I have a problem. Give me an example. I told her I saw a rhinoceros in the morning, she believed it. I said my car almost hit a giraffe dead on the road, she believed it. I said an eagle gnawed me in the office, she believed it. In a restaurant this afternoon, I told her a gorilla smiled at me. She believed it. But she doesn't believe I've got the best salesman award. What exactly do you want to tell your wife? I'm very hardworking. Maybe your wife wants words straight to the point. It's not fun like this, if you don't talk-in-circles. Try and act as my wife. What would you say to me within the day? Speak. - Morning, husband! - Morning, wife! - Going to work, husband? - Going to work, wife? - Coming home, husband? - Coming home, wife? - Let's eat, husband! - Let's eat, wife! - Good night, husband! - Good night, wife! So what's so good about being direct? I'm sorry, time's up. Mr. Hung, you think you're at the open sea? I haven't paid you last week. Money isn't everything, but without money, many things we can't do. Time makes no difference. When you're sad, five minutes is too long. Five hours is too short, when you are happy. Some are born dead, others will have a long life. When we are rich, we should think about the days of poverty. We should understand longevity, when our lives become short. Doctor, I asked if I paid last week. What are you keep talking about? You said you don't like being direct, and talk-in-circles. You must be really funny. I am going to work. Here. - Thank you. - Not at all. How are you? Don't you slip? I'm wearing the shoes you recommended. You were right, not even oil can make me slip. How are you? Doctor, please give me a foot. What? Foot? Be careful! Thank you! - Mr. Hung! - Hey! - Didn't eat at the doctor's? - No. - Hey there! - Hi! The neurotic is back, let's watch his behaviour! Mr. Hung, do you want to warm your lunch box? Thanks, no need! No wonder you go to a psychologist. Has the doctor asked you to enter the mental hospital? How did you know? I ripped off half of that bitch's hair. She said she'll call the police, so I'll stab her to death after I'm done eating. Let's see who goes to the hospital, me or her? Why yours is roast pork, and mine is suckling pig? Just the same! How can be the same, the words sound and mean different things. How does peanuts sound without "t"? Penis! Are they the same? Not mine. Roast meat... Finally, we can break through the mirror today. - You like it? Take it. - Great! Better to live without a house, than eat without meat. Without a house, you freeze. But without meat, you wither. I beg you, kind people. Please, have pity on this fat beggar. Boss! Boss Yip... This must be your most capable salesman Success Hung. He is quite capable, maybe just a little nervous. Your best employees are not normal. Come back to me again, when you'll have a real opponent. No progress without competition. Boss Yip, thank you for your kindness. I still don't want to change company. Ms. Cheng... Look at you! You just wait. Ms. Cheng, your name please. That's right. Ms. Cheng is the best saleswoman in all other companies. I tried everything to ask her to join us. To help the company grow its business, while marketing our new products. She already promised. Yes, I promised to Mr. Yip, because he said that your company has an excellent salesman. It turns out that's you, Mr. Hung. What do you know... You don't know anything. No progress without competition? Let me tell you. In the sales business, no one can match me. Success Hung, we can eat rice because of you. - Yes, Success Hung, we support you! - Thank you! Exactly. You count on him, so you can eat rice. But if you want to eat shark fin, bird's nest and catfish, rely on me. Did she wash her mouth? With your system, 15% commission goes to the company. All right, everyone, keep having fun. Don't be afraid of running out of food, just eat rice. Mr. Yip, I want to start immediately. Arrange me to compete with Mr. Hung. I love competitions. Your first cooperation will be for a big business. A client wants to buy fifty mobile phones. You two will go together. - No problem. - Count on me. Let me deal with the client. You sit and don't talk. No, the boss said to work together. I'm not used to having partners. When I'm done, I'll give you 10% commission. Let me give you 10% of my commission. I'm afraid you can't do the deal. 80-20. 50-50. - 70-30. - 50-50. I won't give you a penny, I'll have it all alone. All right, that's the way. See who's good, the better one. I'll have this deal at any cost, Success Hung. Damn it. Honestly, if you are willing to sleep with me, I'll give you no trouble. This phone has very special features. It has the most advanced electronic equipment, and its shape retains a most classic elegance and beauty. He looks ridiculous with the phone. Like holding a cleaning brush. Mr. Chow... Mr. Chow, close your eyes and listen to me. Close my eyes? This way, you'll be more objective. You smell. - Doesn't it smell good? - Yes, it does. Touch it. - Is it sturdy and rounded? - Yes. - Hold it, does it have texture? - It has. - Awesome? - Awesome! - Do you want to own it? - Sure. But it costs 18,000, which is a little expensive. Mr. Chow, please lend me a dollar. Sorry, I didn't bring coins. Then you can't use public telephones. I own the phone. Try asking me to borrow it. Ask. Miss, can I use your phone for a while? Sorry, I don't have one. You have faced such situations. Even if you can borrow the phone, the one who used it before you, may have a stinky mouth. It feels so uncomfortable using it. It's like kissing him. So you got to have your own phone. And we constantly improve our phones. In the future, you may use the phone as an emergency briefcase handle. Stick it to the ceiling for fitness. You can also have a shower from it. You can take yourself for Spider Man. Stick two phones on the walls of a skyscraper, and climb to the roof... A load of bullshit! The company's future developments are bullshit? But I won't blame you, you have a low position, so you don't know. When I talk about business, you'd better shut up. Mr. Chow... Mr. Chow, this becomes very humiliating. You want a phone, not a hooker. Hey, this is personal attack! Don't argue, give me the phones. Mr. Chow, don't! You'll destroy them both. Exactly. If you fight like this, you'll both lose. I don't understand, this is an emergency phone. This is also an emergency phone, from the same company. What's the difference whom I buy from. It differs, she is new. He is stale, hard to believe him. I don't believe either. I'll buy from the one whose price is lower. - Sign it first. - Sign it for me. In order to have this deal, I can offer everything, including myself too. No matter the cost, me too. How do you know I'm gay? She told me. You know, and you're offering your body? That's insincere. Fatty, you have won the deal for sure. If I didn't win the case, I would be mad. Hey. Take this! Fatty, are you all right? I'm fine! But I want to ask, should I still offer myself? Of course not, I'll be the one to give myself to you! I've got things to do! - It's all right, it's all right... - I'm all right... It's all right... Tsim Sha Tsui police, inspector's office. Hello, I want Mrs. Yu. Just a moment. Call for you. - Thanks. - Not at all. - Yes. - Hello, wife. How is it? How are you doing today? I've met a pervert. He wants my body before he buys a phone. Yes, right... try to lie less often. Really, why don't you always believe me? Fine, I believe you all right. Remember what is today? Today? I promised to give you a flight for our fifth anniversary. - Don't you remember? - Really? We'll go out for dinner later, don't go home. Eight o'clock in the Red House restaurant. All right. Wife, I almost knocked down by a container truck. Right, right, stop joking. Bye-bye. What, you'll eat out? Yes. The murder case outside Sham Shui Po, I sent an officer to investigate there. Fine, your husband asked for dinner, don't be late. Don't give him excuses. What excuses? Ah, whatever. Stop playing games. I won't let anybody interrupt me and my wife. Dude, this has nothing to do with me. You picked the wrong person. Who are you? Which faction? Who is your leader? Who is your boss? What are you doing? You got the wrong person. Who is your leader... Who sent you to kill me? Who sent you to kill me? Who sent you to kill me? Who sent you to kill me? - Dude... - What dude? Forget it, don't chase him. No, he saw me, I must kill him. The car is gone, the people are not here. - What now? Uncle! - You are to blame. I want to kill the fatty. - Why kill him? Let's go! - No, he'll recognise me. - Let's go. - He saw me, uncle. - Let's go. - I must kill him. Inspector, excuse me. I want your signature, to issue a search warrant. We got a clue for the murder in Sham Shui Po. You want me to go? No, you eat with your husband. Hasn't he come yet? - Lisa! - Mr. Hung. What happened? Guess what I saw in the parking lot just now. A dinosaur? No, you won't believe me anyway. I saw someone killing a guy. Two guys killing another. I saw them, and they saw me. Thankfully I'm smart. I could almost escape, and almost couldn't. Finally, I escaped. What do they look like? Fierce and evil, but their faces were covered. Let's talk about this at home. What? I'm telling you, two police officers. You treat me as if I'm lying. Mr. Hung, tell me. I finished. I was chased by two fierce murderers just now. But they couldn't catch you. If they did, would I be alive? Mr. Hung. How long do you need to run 100 meters? How much Lewis needs? 9,87 seconds. I'm not that fast. How many seconds? Hey, what do you mean by asking? I wonder why the two killers couldn't catch you. I ran desperately. They also ran desperately, are they disabled? I am not disabled. Excuse me, being fat doesn't mean you're disabled. Hey, young man. Don't think you are shapely. "Robust" is the word for men. Don't think you are robust. I'm faster than you. I know. Your legs are too short, and you are too fat. Set to run fast. What are you doing? My legs are short? Not exactly. What? You don't believe me? Chase me! Catch me and kick me. Hey, don't... Sir, please don't fight. We're running business here. Please, no trouble. Can't catch you? You said to catch you, why are you hitting? You think I'm a toy with batteries? Will I just let you catch me? I can fight. Catch me. Success Hung! What are you two doing? You, a police officer, disturbing law and order in public places. I blame him for questioning my physique. He said I'm fat and short. Inspector, why did this happen? I'm sorry to mess up your place. Go home! Sorry for the damages here. I'll pay for everything. Good, arrange everything. Who did this? Big Brother, it was a fat man, and two guys with covered faces. I know what the fatty looks like. Mr. Lo... Put the brother's body in the freezer. Find them and bury them alive. So our brother can get into the ground. Brother Kwan, please help us... I warn you, the company's fans are for everyone, not just you. You have it blow only on you, really selfish. And you're not the same? Will you have it blow on me? You try to touch that fan again, just try. Told you, don't touch it! Shameless! You steal from my lunch box, I can sue you. Just think clearly. You have no evidence. You will report a fake case. No proof? No matter how much you swallow, your mouth is full of cayenne flavour. You can't deny your stealing. You don't believe me? Smell it. Your breath smells worse than a toilet. Exactly. Will you tell the police that your food smells like toilet? Hello? Huh? He's dead, look for him in the funerals office. Mind your words. That call was for me. Then you should've said worse things. Mr. Hung. Ms. Cheng, what now? Why not? Let's finish early, I invite you for a midnight movie. Make peace? So how about it, then? Fine, I rarely refuse to women. No tricks? Sincerely. Unless you've changed your mind? I can't refuse. Swear! What movie to watch? You choose. "Lustful, Cheap and Dirty #4". All right, here are 36 dollars. Watch whatever you want. Just disappear immediately. Thank you! I'm going for a movie. Leaving without clothes. Pervert! I'm hot, I'm hot! Ms. Cheng, you asked me to watch porn. But we're alone, a man and a woman, what do you say? Stop messing with me, what do you want?

No need, I've been listening in the office. You haven't finished. Man, this phone has too many advantages, such as... Enough, I already bought them. Thank you, but I still have to explain. When you'll be tired of this job, or fired, come to my shop to work there. Shop? What kind of shop? Funeral office. Your talk can raise the dead. - It can also kill the living. - Thank you. - That's all. - Go ahead. Sir, are you interested? You are... Success Hung. My card. I sell emergency mobile phones. What's your name, sir? - Uh... - Mr. Uh, nice meeting with you. Sorry to bother you for two minutes. Let me introduce you this mobile phone. Mobile phones in general, have either poor signal, or high battery consumption. This one is different. This mobile phone, has a clear signal reception wherever you go. And each battery can last up to 24 hours. It's faster to call for help with your phone, than asking others. Owl, don't go, there is something for you. Does your friend want one too? Even better. One for each, you can talk wherever you are. Owl, I brought a friend. Mr. Owl, it's nice to meet you. Can you repeat to me the advantages of the phone? You don't have to turn your head, you can just tell me. This phone can be used as a suction cup, handle, shower. Whatever you want. This emergency phone is the most technologically advanced product, while retaining a most classic traditional beauty. What's going on? Why chop me? Don't buy, if you don't want it. "Which faction? Who is your boss?" "Who are you? What are you doing?" "Who is your leader?" It's you? Die! Help me! Help me. - Anything wrong? - Nutcase... Murderers. Why? Jealousy? Revenge? So strange. Robbery! Let's go... Let's go... These two are really cruel. I was struggling to escape. Or I'd be in trouble. Good for you, you escaped again. Of course! How else could I report it? I'm accusing you of false statement, suspicion of disrupting public order, misconduct, and obstruction. What? I'm here to report, but you're suing me! Yes, I suspect you have repeatedly teased the police, reporting a fake case. Now, for fourty-eight hours, you have to stay here, and assist with the investigation. What's the meaning of this? What's the matter? Wife, he said I'm obstructing the police, I reported a fake case, and he'll lock me up. Dress first. I'm sorry, my husband is like this, forget it. Inspector, I'm all for your husband. He should go see a shrink. Why do you never believe me? Forget it, let's go home. Hurry up. Damn fatty. Jealousy? Revenge? So strange. I hate when people lie. Who is in charge of this vast universe? All gone! Chairman Mao would die, Jiang Qing would die. I'm just a humble killer, how can I avoid death? A killer who can't kill anyone, how is he worthy to be called a killer? I'm not worthy of being called a killer. I'll be arrested by the police, eventually. Or get killed by other killers. I don't want either to happen. There's a witness to murder. Kill the witness. That'll bring another witness. Kill again. I'm also seen by the entire factory. The whole world is a factory that produces witnesses. What are you saying? I can't help it, I can't help it! You're trying to die! I'm not trying to die, I want to die. Too many people saw me kill. How can I kill that many people? Kill whoever saw you kill? And me? You want to kill me too? Bat, you're too unstable. Wife, I almost got killed today. Stop thinking. How can I? I'll probably die. Try to think of something else. But today they almost killed me. Yes... really terrible! They chased me with machetes, and I ran desperately. I ran, faster and faster... Faster... Faster! Really fast. I ran from Xiyangcai to Shandong. From Shandong street to King's Road. Then... King's Road is across the sea, my husband. Sorry, wrong direction. Now that you know the directions, come again quickly. I kept running, there was a railing in front. I jumped over with force, and fell on the ground. Then I got up. I ran again. The killer rushed up, I tried my best. Fought him hard, with hands, feet, and head. - Either he dies, or I die. Wife... - Enough! I didn't finish! Two killers? Why didn't you talk-in-circles about nonsense, this time? I told her I saw a guy killing someone. Myself, I've been chased. I'm still scared, I can't talk about nonsense. - Your wife doesn't believe you? - Right. How was her expression when listening? How? She was excited and nervous. She's very engaged. She didn't really listen, she pretended. I was doing it while telling. Doing what? Being... a man. She was listening you being a man? Being a man... It means being in bed. Oh, she was listening while you were lying. Being in bed, means to put the fish in the kettle. You were cooking? I was having sex! What's wrong? We shouldn't get too close. You panicked. I will only tell you, I won't show you how. It's better like this. Continue. The doctor? It's an emergency. You have an appointment? Have appointment for an emergency? The doctor is having a patient, let me check. Hello? Dr. Ko, a patient here says it's an emergency. Who's the patient? Please register. Mister... Don't be troubled. Normally we don't need to see a psychologist. Yes, of course... Uncle, don't. I'm afraid of injections. No injections needed for a psychologist. Don't hesitate, go in. In this world, everyone's psychology is unstable. Miss, excuse me. My brother has an emergency. Can mental illness be urgent? Haven't you heard of anxiety? Please leave. - But... - No "but". Stop talking, go out... - Doctor. - I'm here. - You lie down first. - Lie down. Tell the doctor what your thoughts are. How to do that? Be honest. But... No, the doctor will keep your secret. - Is it right? - Right... So you can rest assured. - Uncle! - It's all right... I am a killer who doesn't hesitate. Not only that, but I'm not cutting hands, neither feet. I'm the sword that cuts into the heart. Clean-job hitman. Wonderful! Wonderful... Anything else you worry about? My trouble is that my work has so much pressure. There are too many people to kill. I can't bear it. I've never failed. Until a few times recently. Now, I'm feeling useless. I am worried that, one day, the only person I can kill is myself, doctor! Kill yourself? Lunatic. Right, doctor? If all the killers were like you, nobody would fear to be killed. They have no chance for fear. Because we make them go without pain. Sudden death with no panic. I have a friend who's unfortunate. He met a very unprofessional killer. That made my friend very nervous. He's worried all day long. Don't talk about others, talk about me! You? It's very simple. Stop murdering. Jesus said we should love others just like ourselves. Buddha said, put down the butcher knife, and become a Buddha. Naturally, stop thinking about it, and you'll have no worries. Even if I want to, people will talk. They would have talked already, if they wanted to. Or they didn't want to talk before, but maybe now they do. Even if they wanted to talk now, they wouldn't remember your face. What are you doing? He wants to die swallowing his tongue. Help me, hold his mouth. Hello, have you finished? - Quickly, run! - Why? These are the two killers! They're very nice and trendy. Kill them! Hurry! Go! Hey, in the elevator! Come quickly! Take the stairs! Faster, faster... Hey, give it a hand. How? Can't you talk louder? Mistake, wrong person! Let's go, ignore her. No, I know her, she's one of us. Ms. Cheng, it wasn't intentional. Go, hurry up! They're coming... Uncle, outside! Smoking afterwards? I'm finished... All is over. Rape! Indecent assault! Don't make noise. It hurts! You want to do it again. Rape! - Don't make noise. - Rape! Rape! You'll die! Don't be noisy, you'll die! - I'll die? - Yes, you will die, you know. I will cooperate! I will cooperate! Let's go. It's not safe here. You want to change places? Yes, come on! Hurry! Help! Rape! Indecent assault! Come down, quickly. It's dangerous! Rape! Rape! Indecent assault! Help! Don't come over! Help! Assault! You are crazy! I am crazy? Do you know what is the most precious thing to a woman? I haven't been using it for thirty years. Unwilling to spend it, saving it. You took it all, without even thanking me. I'm all poor and ruined now. I'm broke I tell you. You want another go? Help me! Don't let go, or it's rape and murder. Quickly, pull me up! I'm pulling, just stop talking. Rape! Indecent assault! Help! How are you sliding down? Don't pretend that you're sliding. I'm not pretending! What's going on? Are you blind? Save her first, help! Are you all right, miss? Indecent assault! Rape! He attacked me, catch him! Miss, I just saw him rescuing you. What? He raped me first, and then assaulted me indecently. Then he pushed me down, and finally pulled me up. You took away my private life! And broke down my family! Please, you two, I surrender. You want to surrender? Not so easy! I want to sue you first! I tidied up my stuff after work. I walked normally to the elevator. I pressed the button, waiting for the elevator doors. Then, I had a session with Success Hung. Two guys came in the office. They kicked me out. At the time, I thought it was... No need to say what you thought. Tell me what happened. When I opened my eyes, I saw this bastard. The bastard was him? It's this Success Hung. He was holding a cigarette. Grinning at me. What's "grinning"? Don't interrupt, I'm taking a statement from Ms. Cheng. The prosecutor may not understand what "grinning" means. Write a "slight smile". Hold a minute. Write down "cunning smile". All right, Success Hung was smiling cunningly at her. And then? Then I noticed that I wasn't properly dressed. How not properly? My shirt was taken off, and the skirt was pulled up. Don't talk nonsense! Stop the noise! Ms. Cheng, then what? I found out that I was raped by him. Are you sure? You passed out. I was hit and carried away unconscious to the roof. When I came to my senses, I wasn't wearing clothes. And then, a slight pain. Slight pain? Where? At the nose. Maybe he just assaulted you and not rape you? Have you ever seen a cat walk away when it smells a fish? It would bite it for sure. Yes, the cat would bite even a rotten fish. Ah Xiang, sir. Take this gentleman out. I'm not talking, I won't say a word. Write down "rape". Wife, you'll really write down that? Write down... What did you just call her? Wife... All right, the police family. I'm in a weak position, my good people. I'm finished. Come on, officer. You can write down that I raped him. That'd be the "official" word. You will read the statement before you sign, if you agree. I can really approve? All right then, write it yourself. Officer, I checked it over. Dr. Ko's statement is roughly the same as Mr. Hung's. But some things are absent from Mr. Hung's, you see. I was lying on the bed... Dr. Ko, Mr. Hung comes as a patient. Why you lie on the bed instead of him? He pays, and he wants me to lie down. Speak clearly. I just need it psychologically. Perhaps physically? Shut up! How can you tell me to shut up! I am the plaintiff, you are the defendant. Stop the noise. I'm not on the bed. It's him. I change my confession. Dr. Ko, you think this is a school essay? You cannot change it. The fact that you have raped is impossible to change. I didn't rape you, Ms. Cheng! You hit me unconscious and carried me to the rooftop. You pulled up my skirt, and lit a cigarette to enjoy me, right? I was hunted by two killers... They... It's all a misunderstanding! I know his psychology well. Passionate but not indecent. Not indecent? You ask him. One night, we were alone in the office. He undressed and jumped in front of me. Hey, what are you talking about? That evening... You needed it psychologically, pervert! Is he abnormal? Dr. Ko, you know best. I know, but I can't share the patient's secrets. I'm a pervert? I'm most normal. Unfortunately, drunkards don't mean wine. Is it true? You are three arguing with me, I have nothing to say. We are not interrogating you together. So, you sympathise. We are like sisters. Can sisters share a penis? What is "sisters"? That is to say, sleep and die together. But you two are happier. If I was raped, you were raped. She was raped. Hey... this is the police station. What do you mean by that? Don't talk. Don't interrupt when women talk. Insolvent family case. Officer, please stand aside. Let's stop talking about it. All right, better we sisters discuss how Mr. Hung snores. His snoring is not severe. But he has bad feet for a Chinese. Now that you said it, what's left for me to say? Let's talk about the mole on his leg. All right... Shall we decide what to do next? You said you were hunted down, so you want police protection. Okay, we will consider it. And you? You sue him for assault and rape. Following the rules, you'll do a medical check. What check? Can it be checked? I had a taste of your rice. You could smell cayenne on me. Have you been raped? Quickly, go take her for a test. When I came, you said no checks. Now that's all over, you say there's a check. Forget it. I resign. It's just rape, not rape and murder. You can't stop now. We have your statement, Ms. Cheng. What should I do? I speak, you don't believe. I quit, you're not sure. Can't you check without dissecting me? If you were raped and killed, they'll have to dissect your body. Hey, you are a psychologist. Saying these words, depresses her. She is also a victim. You are so compassionate to her. All right, you two are mocking me together. How can I fight like this? Calm yourself down. Sit down and have a drink. It'll be fine. Can a drink be used for contraception? Can a drink prevent transmitted diseases? Can a drink wash off the fingerprints from my body? Are you neurotic? Saying such words! Right, I'm a lunatic. The psychologist can prove it. You're the cops. Arrest me. Send me to the sanatorium. Take her to the reception room. No need, I'm leaving now. I refuse to be arrested. Shoot me if you want. Shoot me! Outrageous! Don't touch me, get lost! Hey, Ms. Cheng... You are going too far. Ms. Cheng! It's fine. Ms. Cheng! Ms. Cheng. Hey, don't touch me, I warn you. Today I was a little wrong... A little? No, it's me who's wrong, really. So what? I've suffered. Can I rape or assault you back? I won't object if you want to. Go die! Watch out! It's a miserable life. It can't be! Can you age so much after being hit? I'm Ah Ling's mom. Sorry, auntie. Who are you? My name is Hung. How is Ah Ling? You came to visit me or her? Ms. Cheng, I'm sorry. I wanted to save you, who would know... Kill him, mom! Don't get excited. Mom will help you and start cutting pieces. I cut fruit for her. Sorry, auntie! Words alone are useless. Ah Ling lost her father since childhood. Mother and daughter live together ever since. I always wanted a man to take care of her. Mom! Let me finish. We'll both end up in the nursing home. Auntie, why are you telling me these? You know why. Ah Ling's body suffers from two traumatic experiences. Serious injuries, Mr. Hung. Auntie, really, I didn't do anything to Ms. Cheng. I believe you, but my relatives and friends will not. Auntie Qi asked me when will Ah Ling give birth. Having children is not a problem, but what I fear the most is... I dare not speak anymore. Auntie, I am an upright man. I never go out fooling around. Then I can rest assured. I'm leaving first. I'll come to visit you again. Leaving? - Bye-bye. - Bye-bye. Mom, are you crazy? Why are you talking so much to that bastard? Don't say that, looking at you like this. You might be disfigured or become a whore. Don't talk to him? He has to be responsible later. He already has a wife. - What are you afraid of? - Mom... I can see that he's a nice guy. Mom will support you to steal him from his wife. Well... let me think about it. Here we are, go in. This is where the government entertains important people from the mainland. This is a small exhibition hall. Don't come here unless necessary. This is the meeting room. Unless you're meeting with a killer, you won't need to come here. Don't enter for no reason. This is the library. These books are not for you. Don't come in, all right? That's the toilet. If nothing's wrong... Don't worry. Not going in, unless necessary. Wrong. Don't go in, no matter what. Because your room is upstairs and you have a toilet in it. You have no real reason, don't go in. Hey, no cameras, no police dogs. Is this house used to protect important witnesses? Big cases have increased recently. By contrast, your case is less serious. Why did you fall down? - How are you? - All right. It's nothing... What are you playing? Are you playing? I'm not playing, go up! Mr. Hung, your room. What do you think? Don't ask me, I've got work to do. You sleep by yourself. Won't we share my room? Share the room with you? Do you want Mr. Ai to share a room with Dr. Ko? No need, no need... Rest assured, each of us has a room. This won't work. I'm afraid in a room alone, and I can't share it with strangers. This won't work, that won't do. What do you want? You have a room with my wife. All right... Am I not a stranger? I'm also a stranger. I know your husband. Then have a room with my husband. All right? All right... then I'll have my own room. Which one... Which one... The toilet? Any room you want. Just this one. - Thank you. - Not at all. What is it? Nothing, just to see which one you are in. Ah Bing, have food? - Yes, let's eat together. - Nah! The roast goose is delicious tonight. Thank you. Not at all. Thank you. - I can do it myself. - Let me help. Are you all right? Why is it trembling? - You're not well? - Not well, but psychologically. Tell me if you're feeling discomfort. I'll say, if something happens, who protects who? - Is there a difference? - Sure. What do you want? I think it's useless. My wife... Hey, don't call me "wife" here. Female officer protects me, male officer protects you. Do you give orders here? We will handle it. You hear? We two have no choice. - Doomed to help ourselves, alone. - No way! Mr. Hung, if you are lucky, you will not die. But I am dead. Did you see anyone help me with vegetables at dinner? I will give you. No need. I finished, going back to my room. Enjoy your meal. Don't think wild. Be careful! You be careful too. What is it? I'm all right. What tricks you play? Not playing. It's a test. To prove the situation. It's now confirmed that if something happens, he protects her, she protects him. Mutual protection. I said I'll be dead. You sit there like a piece of wood. Are you spreading discord? No. I don't care if someone's family is happy. I worry most about my safety. Anyway, let it be. Sleep. If something happens, at least find a place to hide. Why do you just sit there? Didn't you protect me? We protect those who can move. If I move, you'll be the next one moving. You want to move me? Come on. Hey, how dare you? Either you move him or not, he has moved your wife's ideas. I'm a troublemaker... What did you say? If you stare at me like this, I'll hit you. Mr. Hung, let's talk about it tomorrow. What's up with you? - Wait till tomorrow. - Wife... I told you. - Good night. - Good night. - I can't sleep yet. - Me too. Sorry, it's a good thing to interrupt you. What did you say? I talk in a dream... What is it? I have something to show you. - Look in the mirror. - What? See who comes out of your wife's room. - It was only my wife... - Yes. - What do we do now? - I don't konw. Where is Dr. Ko? - What to do? - You are the brain. Why do you sleep in my husband's room? Hey, I'm only standing in your husband's room. Ask me, I'll explain more clearly. No explanation needed. I just want to know why she screamed. It's a misunderstanding. I was wrong, made a mistake. Excuse me. Nothing to do with me. Success! I'm Ling-Ling! Hello... Who is it? You are great. Yes? - Success? - Yes, who is it? I'm Ling-Ling. Ling-Ling, are you all right? I'm fine. But more important is you to be fine. You don't have to worry about me, but I miss you. When I recover, I'll have tea with you. All right, we'll go out for tea. I will call you later. Bye-bye. I believe I was taking care of you. You dare to eat at my expense. Brother, give us a chance. Why did you do wrong? You only say a sentence, and that's to ask me to give you a chance. Why don't you give me a chance? Why? Why are you colluding with them, and do things wrong? Why? Why? Pull them to the secret room and hang them. Don't give them food or water. If they don't die in a week, let them out. Big Brother, don't! Give us a chance! Yes, yes... Brother, don't! Lied to me for twenty yuen? Take it with you! I hate when people lie to me. Big Brother, I found that fat guy. What about the other two? I haven't found them yet, but don't worry. Now that I've found the fat one, I can definitely find them too. But the fatty is now protected by the police. Even if the god of heaven protects him, we must catch him. - Remember, catch him alive. - Yes! Thank you for your blessing, Brother Kwan. Second brother, you can get into the ground soon. Thank you! Stop playing, she'll be angry. Thank you... I don't give a damn. I have no time to mess with you, drink a glass of water. Sorry. Cicada... Psychologically, people may think I did it intentionally. But I didn't. You hit me? Don't hit... Wife... - Wife, don't hit. - Let me go... Don't raise your hands. Hit me? Hit me? Hey, don't hit... Let go of me! You are crazy. You two are the crazy ones. I reserve your right to collude with and beat important witnesses. Try if you dare! You are crazy. Why are you hitting me? It's you who's crazy. Why are you holding me? To stop you two from fighting. Is this your approach? You hold me and they beat me to death? Why don't you hold her? You are my wife, of course I'll hold you. Why would I hold her? What are you laughing at? Can't I laugh a bit? Laughing is fine, but going after my wife is not. Unless I'm dead. - Hey! - Hey! Success Hung, do you know who I am? The killer! Asshole. If you have the guts, meet me at 3 Ashes Road. Hey, what's your game? Nothing. We can't protect you forever. So I lead them out, and we sweep them away. They may sweep us away as well. Hey, what's your plan deep inside? Don't talk nonsense, this is what we the police do. It's me again? Why do you always support him? I'm not supporting him. Don't look at me like this, I just want to help you. Help my ass. Hey, hey! It's all right... It's typical of him. Uncle, 3 Ashes Road. Let's go kill him. Bat, forget it. No, no! We will not die if we get caught by the police. But if we get caught by the Big Brother, it will be worse than death. We'll be ghosts if we don't succeed this time. - Bye-bye. - Goodnight. I must rely on myself, from now on. Come on, you'll die! Go in through the back door. Hey, there's a hole in here. Uncle, someone's coming! Hide, hurry! Uncle, what should we do? - Let's leave. - What? It's not too late, let's forget it. No, no... - Don't ask me then. - Fine, fine... What is this, Uncle? Don't move! Who are they? Who are you? What are you doing here? Where is the fat guy? Take us to him. Hurry! Go! Don't kill me! I won't kill you right now. It has nothing to do with me... Take him away! Huang Sen, help! - Don't move! - Don't move! I won't let you take him away. Kill him! Faster! Faster! Be careful! Hurry up to save my husband! All right! Protect the fatty! These two killers have nothing to do with me! Thank you for your help. Bat, let's go! Owl! Heroes! You can't kill me, your shooting skills are bad. My marksmanship is accurate. They are really useless, if they can't kill you. Are you afraid? Take it. Do you know you are very annoying? My wife doesn't think so. Don't fuck me, tell him not to fuck me. If you can't stand it, find a place to hide. I didn't know you are useless. I'm useless? Go away! It has nothing to do with me. Terrific! - What do you mean by that? - So what? - You're just bullying me. - Of course! Which one of you is my wife? Husband, are you all right? Save me, husband! Wife! It's all right. The jewelry store above is great. - Let's have a look. - Fine. Where to go tonight? Not seen for two years, how are you? Good, good... Still selling phones? No, I changed career. Now I sell toilets. Does it suit you? Take it if you're interested. No need! Let me introduce you. He is my husband. - His name is Robert. - Robert. - Nice to meet you. - Me too. Thank you. Thank me? Thank you for taking care of my wife for two years. She is not your wife now, she is my wife. I should thank you. Thank me for what? Thank you for taking care of my wife for so many years. - I thank you... - I thank you... - I thank you... - I thank you... Sorry... Is this your business? Let it go, or you'll be beaten up, and that is your business. Hong Kongers are really evil! Husband! - Calm down yourself. - I'm all right. Husband, I've fixed it. You have met. Lisa! Husband, I broke all the toilets in the entire mall. - And I asked the manager to buy from us. - Really? He wanted me to sit on one and show him. Did you sit? Of course, that's why he buys from us. Yes, of course! - Dr. Ko! - Yes. - Dr. Ko! - Hi! Long time no see. Yes, long time no see! How's business lately? I changed career. I swapped to animals. Animals go crazy too? Yes, cats and dogs are all mentally abnormal. Like this cat, it often thinks of itself as a dog. It's afraid of seeing mice, and suddenly barks. And watches the house when you're out. Look how poor this cat is! Is this a cat? Fortunately it's not an elephant. I won't talk to you anymore, bye-bye! - Taxi! - Taxi in the mall, nuts! Bye-bye! Let's go. Translation: Vasilis M.
