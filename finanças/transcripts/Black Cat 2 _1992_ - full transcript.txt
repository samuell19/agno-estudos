Ready? Starting Phase 1. Erase her memory. Understood. Stop! You're not authorized to leave. Let me out! Let me out! Stop! You were dead. We saved your life. We implanted a microchip in your brain. Now you're part of the elite that must work for the government. It's time for you to correct your mistakes and start a new life. This is your only chance. From now on, you are no longer Erica. Your code name will be Black Cat. Starting phase 2. Implant the microchip B2 in the brain. She's rejecting the chip. Her condition is unstable. What's the problem? What is the blood pressure? It's 100 over 70. The brain activity is increasing rapidly. Impossible. The operation must stop. You can't make that decision. Talk to the boss. Hello, speaking! Black Cat is rejecting the microchip. She is going into shock. How did it happen? I want to suspend the operation. She could die at any moment. Have you already forgotten? She is already dead. The operation must be completed, no matter what. Sedate her immediately! Prepare the microchip. The operation will continue as planned. Look how pretty it is! - Here you go! - Thanks. Hey Chekov. Calm down! It's the USA! With us close you are safe. Come on, have a drink! Don't worry, he's one of us. - Hi boss! - Hello! How is the Russian? Very good, but a second ago he spilled whiskey on himself. He's fine now. He got away with too many stolen secrets, he's obviously nervous. Be careful. A lot of people want him dead. Understood. Hello! Welcome to the USA! Hello, big man! How's it going? how was the trip? He is a pretty boy. Hi Mike? Dad! - Dear son! Dear! - Chekov! I missed you. Me too. - Did they treat you well here? - Yes, they were good. Sweetheart, from now on we can be together. I'm not dreaming, am I? You're not.. Excuse me, could you come over here, please? Here's $10 million in cash. I already deposited the rest into your account. Your passports and airline tickets are here. Tomorrow, you should be able to travel with your family to Brazil. Can you give us the negatives? Sure, wait for me. Look, Chekov. I know there's more. Where did you hide the rest? I must confirm mine and my family's safety. I can deliver the rest. Do you understand the danger you are in? Now they're mission is to kill President Yeltsin. We need the negatives back! I know, but these microfilms... they are the only thing that ensures my safety and that of my family. I have no choice. What's wrong? We already gave you what you asked for. Money, passport, identification, plane tickets what more do you want? Sorry! Calm down Robin! Being impatient is of no use. The best thing is that you give us the rest as soon as possible. Bye. Come to dad, dear son. You too, sweetheart! Are you hungry? These breads are fresh. It smells very good. We will never have to stand in line to eat bread. Boss, these people are greedy. We have to force them. Robin, this is America. Everyone has freedom of choice. Didn't you know that the Chinese have a saying? Why kill the chicken if you just want eggs? You should have heard it before. I heard it, but I don't understand it. Look in a dictionary. Stay here. - Dad! - Came back! it is dangerous! Mom! Mom... Take care of the child. Robin, run down the slope. Call all units! They are going down the slope. How are you Robin? Give me the helmet! give it to me! Don't go. You haven't recovered. Where do you think you're going? I want to go. Your brain suffered a concussion. You have to stay in observation I don't think you're fine despite having no injuries. Your brain could suffer trauma. My responsibility is to ensure that you're in perfect health before you go. Until the report comes out, I can't let you go. Come here. Look at this boy. He came from Russia with his parents. They expected us to give them protection. But now, they were murdered. How am I going to explain it to the world? And my colleagues! Many died innocently! His killers are terrorists that threaten world peace. My responsibility is to arrest them. I can't sit in a corner and do nothing. I'm just a doctor. I can't help you, sorry! If you want to help, let me go. I will be responsible for my own safety! I must catch them as soon as possible! That's right! I want you to take care of the anti-Yeltsin organizations. When will I have it? Not for now. still very perceptive to ultrasound and high-frequency audio. That's why we need more time to improve that detail. Can you speed up the times? I need it immediately! Do you think she's a video game? It's a high-tech product. You can't get in! What do you want? Boss! - I wanted to stop him but he insisted on going in. - It's ok, Judy. - How did you get out of the hospital so fast? - Those killers are still on the loose. Look at you! Haven't you had enough for one day? I'm perfectly fine! Last time I was careless. Give me another chance! Do you want to return? Alright. But I will assign someone to assist you. Who? Black Cat. Thanks, but if you give me an hour, I'll put together a search party and I'll go to the mountains. Robin, if you want to go back you must go with her. She is just a woman she will only slow us down. She can't help. If i could choose i would prefer these two. Okay! Gentlemen, give him a hand! What's up Mike? What's wrong with him? The helicopters are ready. Thank you very much! What are you doing? See you later! Yes! What? Miss, your plane is blocking my path! Could you move your plane? What? What do you want? And what do you think of your new partner? I don't know what you mean. Convinced? She is Black Cat! I want you to get together and catch those killers. What? impossible! You want me to work with her? Don't even think about it! You have no choice, Robin. If you want to solve this case, you will have to work with her. We already informed the head of the Department of security. and closed the access to the hillside. They will not escape! Stop! What's going on? The roads are closed. Vehicles are not allowed to pass. But my farm is ahead, if i don't go back my cattle will starve. I'm sorry, but it's my supervisor's order. I can't help you. Turn around and leave! Don't do it! They charged against the barrier! Requesting reinforcements! They charged against the barrier! Open fire! Move, hurry! Run away! Go! Don't let him get away! What did you find? We found a chemical in his stomach. It improves his fighting skills. It's a strange and dangerous drug. It is also radioactive. I have reason to believe that the other killers had that chemical in their bodies Is there a way to track its location? Yes, Black Cat's B2 microchip, can detect that radioactivity. Perfect! then enter the formula in Black Cat. I'll have to test her first! No, I must find this killer as soon as possible. I'm sorry but we went over this bridge 3 times already. Can you really locate this killer? Can you hear me? God dammit! All we do is drive back and forth. I don't know what you want exactly. Are you deaf or dumb? Robin. What? We have driven for hours. Do you know where she's taking us? What do you think? Go on. Keep going, understood? Do we keep driving? I need a break. My stomach's growling! Alright, i understand. We've been driving for days and still got nothing. We don't even know if she can detect anything. I don't know either. A lot of money was spent in that microchip... and it's still useless. They claim that she is a wonder, that she can do this and that. Bullshit! Really? You think so? Don't say stupid things, before you understand her capabilities. I'm afraid she'll kick your ass. What? Her? Kick MY ass? More than possible! I doubt it! No! Move! move! Don't get too close! Stay away, miss. She is a terrorist. What terrorist? She's my mother! Who killed my mother? Get out of my way! Mom... She is already 70 years old. How could she be a terrorist? Why was she killed? An elderly woman with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, was shot dead this morning. The murderer is suspected to be involved with the CIA. President, it was an accident.. We use her to track down Russian assassins. Regarding the old woman, the same radiation was found on her body, due to the chemotherapy. We think the old lady was a victim of a CIA miscalculation. President. Yes. I promise you it won't happen again. Yes I know. Black Cat is still in the testing phase. She is not ready. Go ahead! We erased her memory. She is incapable of making judgments. I don't know what happened, boss. But she got out of control. Sit down Robin. From now on, I want you to watch Black Cat 24 hours a day. 24 hours? Seriously, boss? Of course! You'll watch her all day. If she gets out of control stop her with this remote controller. Here! I don't want my Dept. in the news again! Robin, Black Cat didn't let you sleep last night? Don't even... I don't know what sleep is anymore! Anyway, this girl's made it very difficult for me. What's that? You complain about your job, when you are surrounded by beauties. I'd kill to be you. You really want her? We could switch jobs if you wish. Where are you going? - Follow me! - Okay! Over there! - Over there! - Okay! Don't be afraid.. Where is his Royal Highness? I called plenty of times but no one answered. Excuse me, your Highness! We're late. We must leave immediately to the airport. Your Highness? Your Highness! Prince Feisal of Jiham from the Middle East, met with President Bush this morning. In their two hour meeting... they discussed the peaceful situation in the middle east... and the possibilities of the economic cooperation between both countries. The prince will leave the US tonight and continue the debate in Europe. His first stop will be in Czechoslovakia. I'm Beck Billy, reporting in from FBC. Dammit! Stop the car! Where are you going? Wait for me. Stop the car! Stop! Are you crazy? Standing in the middle of the street like this? Lend me your car! What? Car thief! car thief! Run her over! What is that girl doing? Let's call the police! Stop! It's the prince! Someone got hit! Stop it! protect the prince! It's a misunderstanding... wait... Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Stay calm, stay calm! Drop the gun and don't move. On the floor now! Don't move... now! Get down on the floor! Do not move... - I'm from the CIA. - Any proof or identification? - No. - Then stop lying! Take him away! What happened? Your country promised to protect the prince. The prince almost lost his life. - Take us to the airport now! - Understood. - Where to? - To the airport. Go! Attention all units! It's me, Leo! The Corpse of Prince Feisal was found in an hotel room. I think the assailant, escaped disguised as the prince. Order all units to close all avenues to capture the suspects. Kill anyone if necessary. You guys go over there. CIA. Where is Feisal's private jet? I'll look that up for you. Please proceed to Entrance 26. Who's in charge here? I am, what happened? CIA When does Feisal's private jet leave? He left an hour and a half ago. Why? That prince is an impostor! Can you tell them to come back? I'll do what i can. George, listen. We have a big problem with Prince Feisal's jet. Where is it? Can you bring it back? It's already left our airspace. Damn! MOSCOW THE USSR GUARANTEES WORLD PEACE Patience, young man. This is Russia! Please, sit down. I apologize for making you wait so long, Mr. Ambassador. I was in a meeting. You're being modest, General. We received important information, related to the safety of President Yeltsin. We are already fully aware of the existence of this anti-Yeltsin organization. We also maintain a closed surveillance of their activities. But so far... we believe that they are incapable of seriously compromising the life of the president. Also, they already made plans for a murder in the USA. The main concern... is that this organization had military training. So don't underestimate them. Since you put it like that, are you insinuating our incompetence to protect the president? I'm not saying that! I only point out that... we have a way to find the one who wants to kill Yeltsin. Because his body carries a high degree of radioactivity... we made a special device to locate them. What are you saying? We hope that you could help us. Don't you know that in Russia... every cancer patient could have that high degree of radioactivity? General, i think we should stop wasting time. What do you mean by that? Are you aware that I can get you deported at anytime? If anything happens to Yeltsin, it's your responsibility. Stop, you two! Calm yourselves and sit down! The fact is that, We are faced with the same dilemma. President Yeltsin will arrive to Washington... for an official visit during the next month. He and President Bush will sign an economic reform agreement for Russia. We wouldn't want anything to endanger the diplomatic relationship between the two countries. Of course! That's why we must have a plan. And since you've come such a long way, i insist that you have a tour of our country. Regarding the members of the organization anti-Yeltsin, of course we'll track them down. I just hope you don't get in trouble during your stay in Moscow. I wouldn't want anything to happen to you. Go to hell! We can't leave things like this, unresolved. I have to catch the killer before Yeltsin visits the US. If not, you will be in danger. Don't worry, i've already sorted things out. They are following us. Drop us off ahead Mr. Ambassador. Where are they? How did they disappear? Those bastards from the CIA are following us again. I feel high radiation in them. They might be the killer's henchmen. Don't move! GRADUATION CEREMONY OF MOSCOW MILITARY OFFICERS Rosalichev! Come forward. Rosalichev, I congratulate you on your graduation. As of today, you will be a part of our army. I hope you will serve our country with loyalty. Thank you, Mr. President! Kalschov, come forward. Kalschov, your performance was outstanding throughout the training course. I'm very happy to have you join our force. I hope you serve our country with loyalty, the best that you can. They want to kill the president! Protect the president! Protect the president! Catch that man! Don't let him get away! - Are you okay, Mr. President? - Escort the President out! This way, quick. Jump in! Go! There he is! Hurry, follow me! Number 372. It's right there. Take it easy! Are you okay? Let's split up. Stop running! Go to hell! Are you from the anti-Yeltsin organization? Tell me who's the murderer! What the hell are you saying? I don't know what you're talking about! Again, where is your boss? I don't know what organization or boss you're talking about. I have nothing to do with them. Why are you asking me this? Is everything ok? I have a headache. Are you alright? Stop! Don't move! Don't move! Why are you standing there? Call an ambulance! Right now! Injured woman. Send an ambulance right now. Can you ear me? Quickly...! To the operating room. She is badly hurt. Yes sir, it's ready. Hello, Mr. Ambassador, how are you? Fine, thanks. The dean is waiting for you. We already followed his instructions. You can't operate her. I said you can't operate on her. Why? What's the problem? The US ambassador is using his diplomatic authority to stop the operation. What? What did he say? The US ambassador is using his diplomatic authority to stop the operation. We can't do anything. What? Your ambassador is upstairs Why don't you go ask him? He says your ambassador is upstairs. You can go up and ask him. Thank you for cooperating. Bye! What happened? Why aren't you allowing the surgery? Did you also know what she had in ther brain? If the Russians discover this secret... think about what they can do to her. I don't care if they find out! I understand how you feel. But she is our biggest state secret. I must proceed like this. Don't you have a shred of humanity? She is a human being, not a machine! She will die! I'm sorry but i can't do anything. She will die if you don't let them operate on her! I've already prepared a private jet to send her back to the US to avoid leaks. Besides, there isn't much time left. How is she, doctor? She is recovering but the scanner shows that the B2 in her brain has been damaged. What does that mean? Will she be okay? She is fine. Let's go! It's alright... It was just a dream. Are you okay? Do you want water? - What? are you tired? Come on! - I can't. Come on! Let's go! Does it look good? Happy Birthday! Who's birthday? Yours! I don't know when my birthday is. If you don't know, i'll tell you. Today is your birthday. What else do you know about me? Your name was Erica. What else? That's all i know. Sorry. Calm down, Erica. I will help you discover your origin. Are these photos from your childhood? Yes. I want to know who i was in the past. I'm sure you looked cute and pretty as a child your hair was long and you had a ponytail. your face was round and a little freckled. Your eyes weren't very big. And your nose? Well, let's not talk about your nose. Every time you smiled you could see a rotten tooth. Why would you always have a rotten tooth? Because you loved eating this birthday cake that i made! - Well... - Okay! Okay! Let go of me! let me go! What are you doing? Erica! - Where are they taking her? - Back to the lab. I'm going to perform corrective surgery. To improve the functionality of the B2. It will be enhanced if it's not sensitive to high-frequency vibration and heat. There's nothing wrong with her now! Robin, don't forget who you are. I want to stop doing this as much as you do. She is a weapon that was created. She is a human being! She's not a lab experiment! Robin, we're doing this because we don't have any other option. Straighten your hands and relax. I can't get close to him with so much surveillance. He's very dangerous. We have to take the risk. It's our best chance. If you don't shoot him... we have a second solution. President Yeltsin arrived at the military airport Andrews, Washington, this morning. He was received by the secretary. Yeltsin will meet with Bush later in the white house. Both hope to agree on the new long-range nuclear weapons cutbacks. How are we supposed to guarantee protection now? How should i know? Yeltsin will visit the Cultural Center, with Major Johnson. Friends, we are facing a cold-blooded killer. We don't know where he is hiding. What do you think? Professor, what about Black Cat? Black Cat is recovering. If the killer can block his radiation... Black Cat's B2 technology won't be able to detect it. Boss! Hello everyone! So far, we haven't been able to track down the Russian assassins. Now, I would like to reverse the process. This time I want him to come towards us. Be careful. I don't want him to get away! Everything's alright, over. The president's car is approaching. Everyone watch out! Understood! Be alert! Get out there and watch out! What's the situation? Not bad, everything is ok. Welcome, Mr. President. My wife Nancy. How's it going? How are you? It's a pleasure meeting you. I'm glad that you could come to this Cultural Center for a visit. Later, we will see a children's ballet composed by a famous Russian musician. The dancers are also Russian. We did everything you asked Mr. President. The activities for today will be in private. There won't be many guests to distract us. Robin! Yes! How's the situation over there? So far so good. Something's wrong. This doesn't look good! Catch her! Don't move! don't be stupid! Are you okay, mr. president? Watch out! Protect the president! - What now? - Go the other way. Over there! Tell all units to cover all the exits. Call the ERT. We need reinforcements! What are you doing? - Are you okay? - Get off me! You stole my car, bitch! Up! Let's go! Attention all units. I'm Chief Daniels. As soon as you catch the killer, don't shoot him. We want him alive. You're surrounded. Give up and you will not be harmed. Don't shoot! They might hurt Black Cat! Down! down! Erica, are you okay? It's okay, calm down! We will take care of her. Step aside, please. Robin, the game's over. We did our job and the mission's done. - What? - Let's drink, to celebrate the victory. Do you think this is a game? Well, of course, it's a game. There is a winner and a loser. The only thing is, he chose to be the loser. And Erica? What did she choose? She already completed her task. She is a human being, not a machine! Why are you so agitated? Come on! Let's go for a drink, it's on me. You know what? You can go fuck yourself! Translation: atompunk8
