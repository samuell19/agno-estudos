Here I am, at your service. One moment, Xanon. I go. Easy, I wait. Good morning, Miss Anna Hello, Xanon. Always working, eh? Yes, what else? Every day more beautiful. Have you come to buy something? Yes, but was am told that this year prices have risen. That we'll discuss later, do you want a boxfull of fruit? Great. Fruit is like a woman, you should never buy without trying it. It would have seemed strange if you did not to tell that. -Come on. -Of course. How is Mrs. Marta? Well, thanks. What about the teacher? Claudia has taken the children for a walk in the woods. Do not you ever have a free moment? Why don't you come some day to the city, say, Saturday night, for instance?, I am always on the Golden Pig. I would like Xanon, but I can not. Wait, wait. Thanks, but I can do it myself. As you wish. Shall I hold it? -Xanon... - Yes? Maybe you'll see me better this way. But Miss, what are you doing? I was watching, it's true, but the earth swallow me whether there was any malice in my intentions. I am an amiable person, a good person you can ask anyone you want. Here, for you, for your wife, and your children. You are too kind. And if you agree with the price, tell me. Of course, Miss, of course. As soon as possible. -Goodbye. -Goodbye and thanks. -Thank you for your warm welcome. -To you. Goodbye. And say hello from me to Miss Claudia. Ana! What? I brought a piece of cake and gifts and confetti that you've forgotten downstairs. I don't even remember your name. I'm Claudia. Ah. Why did you leave in the middle of the party? Because I was bored, I don't like parties, I do not like children and do not like first communion. But your mother has been kind enough to invite us to come... She is not my mother, she's Aunt Marta, and not even my aunt because I am her first husband's niece. So where's your mom? She's at Trevizo, crying. Why? Because dad is a pig that runs behind the skirts and left her alone, pretty and young, weeping. How? Because dad is a pig that runs behind skirts and left her alone, young and pretty, such a shameless! Well, maybe I better go down. I'll leave you here, bye. Is it true that you know dance? What? You have told the priest that your family is poor, but they have been sent you to the dance school. Yes, indeed. -Prove it. - Now? Dance! Very good. Now we'll invent a game. Yes. Can you play the target practice? I've never tried. No matter, you take these darts and shoot very strong. - Where? -To the picture. The mouth is worth three points, the nose 5, and eyes 10. But whom is the picture? It's mine, do not worry, you think of the target. But no, not like that! Look, stronger, this way. See? It's not that hard. The mouth, I did hit him in the mouth! I aim to the nose. There goes, goal! Three points, I have made three points! - Five! -You re more used to, can I shoot with both hands? Yes, yes, with four, if you want. With four, you think I am an octopus? Well, almost. The eyes, I hit the eyes! Let's start again, another round, another gift. Why not count the points? Wait, wait, come, let's shoot together. One, two, three. - I hit! - And me! Looks like a sieve! Good thing it's paper, go! Do not cheat. Mouth, three! -Nose, five. -Eyes, 10. Bravo! Eggs, let's try with eggs. But they are incubating, would not like it. Nah, they do not care for anything! Then I shot all at once. No, not at the same time, it is too easy. What crap! Look, they seem to have runny nose. No, they were always with their handkerchief in their hand. So you know them? Of course I know them. Who are they? They are mom and dad. What is it now? Do not do that to parents. Not yours. It does not matter. Okay, I'm sorry, but stop mourn at once. You want my cake? -No. - Want me to escort you down? So what do you want? Good stop! Come for them! Do not let him take it off! You'll be awkward! Come on, you play too! I do not care. Yes, you like! I say no. You're dying. I know if I want to or not. One moment, I go for him. Sport is important at your age. I'm already fledged. So what does that matter? Look, look there. Been injured. Hey, listen, here's the alternate, he is a true champion. Well, if you do not mind... I tell you no. Easy, I'm going for cigarettes. -Niki... - Yes? Won't we be late to your sister's? You do not worry about my sister, no hurry, concentrate on the game. Wait a minute, wait. Come, Niki, hurry! Yes, yes, I'm here, I come. Did you bring the photos? Yes, here they are. How many? Five. Only? With as much as your father has? Yes, but could not catch them all, he had realized. Where do we go? The mill. Come on up! At this time there is never anyone. What about the miller? He's at home, sleeping. At noon? Have not you noticed his wife's legs? Yes, you're right, but anyone gets by her. Come on, let's get here. Take out the pictures, I'm dying of curiosity. Here. No, wait, slowly, one at a time. Pictures sure are sluts, no? The most sluts I've found. Okay, give me. Christ, what tits! She's Spanish. Are you sure? Her name. Goya. Goya Troya. Yes, and watch this. This is even better, watch the hand! I want to touch her. This one will get me crazy. And also she fakes to sleep, Will be a bitch! What's her name? Georgione. Georgione may be the name of the painter. Are not you ashamed, very large lizard? Even before the painter she gets naked. Yes, you also like bigger ones? I like them all. Then watch this. Miguel Angel. Yes, look at her thighs. And look at that piece of dick! - How? - This here, in your opinion, what is? Sorry, I had not noticed. Pay attention, stupid! Can not you distinguish one thing from another? Yes, yes, but not in haste... What happens? Shut up. Here is one who is shaking it, go away. Rosino! Yes? Look, it's the broken branch that makes noise when the wind pushes. It's only that. True, you're right. Yes, it seemed someone who... - God! - What? How cold is the water! It's frozen, I think this time I am not going to bathe. Do not be a coward, get in the water now. My God! Rosino, what do you think? Are you sick? - Yes! - Why? Look out the window. Why? Look out the window! Are the washers. No, they are naked! Flesh and blood, naked! It is too, too much, too! I go crazy, crazy, I'll go crazy! Enough, Rosino. No, leave me alone! - Look! - What are you doing, you got crazy? Look, look, look... But Rosino, listen... Shut up! Here I am, you got it. Look at me, evil women! Look at me, what I have been reduced! But it is yours, all yours! Out of here! Yes, look at me. Get out of here, you scoundrel! I'll give you a shoehit on your head so you will forget all your female obsessions! Come here, I'm giving you a good spank! Wait, wretched, still! Okay, Mariana, well, hit him whit the shoe, strong, strong! That child has wings on his feet! But Mariana, you're already tired? What do you want?, That child is too fast. We'll tell your father. I do not know who is worse. You do not know what fine some little thing! He may be a child but he's not bad at all! In a few years we will look for him like crazy! If my husband should put even half interest that child does! Soon he begins to open his fly! So now what? Let him, boys! Piccio, what you do, you crazy?! Stop it, stop it! Enough, guys, stop it! Come along, come with me, they'll kill you! Stop it, come, let him now. Those sons of bitches, four of them got over me! So, for no reason? - Yes! - Say, it's never your fault? - Niki, I assure you... - Then, why have you committed to play? - Me? - Okay, let's not argue, wait until I clean the wound. One can not play with you. The have left you a pity indeed. And on top my fault. I know nothing. They're all a pack of savages. Be quiet. Now, quiet! Sit, sit. I can not bring you home in this state. Women would be frightened, here. -Thanks. -Dry. Cigarette? No, thanks. Niki! Niki has come! - Ana! - Coming! Niki has come! I have not had time or wash. Niki! Aunt Marta, Niki has arrived! My dear Claudia! Oh, Niki! I knew it, knew it would end so all day on tenterhooks waiting and finally I fell asleep like a log. Oh, my God, I have to remove all these junk here! Or he'll scare and believe that the heart is failing. It is, well, well. How well they get by, blessed them! Also I have to trash these medicines, which are useless, nor the doctors either. It's over, In any case, to reassure people a little lipstick... Oh, God, how horrible! What can we do... A bit of makeup. Aunt Marta! Coming! -Marta... -Nicola... Abracadabra, goat's ass. Who is the prettiest in this house? I am. No, it is Marta. Fuck your rant! Niki, Niki, please do not be silly! Put me down please do not be silly! You can not handle so much weight. That I can not? Come on, you're not a child, please... Help, Niki! The carpet, the carpet! My God! Aunt Marta! What happens? Ana, help me. He is an idiot! But Marta, I have stumbled. Are you hurt? Hurt, me? Maybe you, you're now an old man I could only lose the wig. Thank goodness. Put your feet up. Here comes at last, pretty partner he sought for business! You'll see what trouble he gets you in! Huh, should I be idiot! I haven't even introduced him. -Now. -Come. He is Piccio. Niki, that we already imagined. Will not you sit? Yes, thanks. Well, actually, my real name is Sandro. They call him Piccio since he was a kid. Thank you, sweetheart. It's a family custom. Really? If you saw so nice a car he came on, Aunt Marta, for our trip to Venice... It is marvelous, you'll love it! It is silver, convertible... It looks new, but it is an older model, right? Yes, we just restored it. A glass of wine? Thank you. And how many you sell in a year? Four or five, but very expensive. And, of course, he is the one who hones. Well, as I am mechanic... Because my dear brother, in fact, has never been able to help me even to place a painting. Yeah, but the idea has been mine, arms and mind. -A genius. -Yes, you're right. -Aunt Marta... -Thank you, sweetheart. -Niki. -Please, vade retro! What, you don't drink anymore? I no longer drink, I no longer eat, I am an ascetic! No longer eat no bread, no pasta, or salami, or apple pie. By the way, where is Caterina? She got angry. Why? Because tonight we will dine out. Oh, I'm so sorry! For her, life is like a long meal will not let anyone miss the table except the dead. Nurse! Caterina! It seemed strange he had not asked for her. Yes, he has always had great affection for her. Caterina. Caterina, how are you? Good. It's Niki, nurse, Marta's brother. Is that you no longer recognize me? Yes. So? What's wrong? Ah, you're angry because we are eating out! Ana and Claudia work during the day, Caterina, you know. No time to cook for everyone. Only the gypsies do not eat at home. I would not be so sure, Caterina. And I ran out of milk. That's serious but you know that these things happen as time passes. Do not be scared by that. It was the full moon's fault. Yeah, sure you're right, everything should be on the stars' fault. Give me your hand. What happens? In the past you had no beard. No, Caterina, no. Not in the past. The shower is now free. Thank you. What is it, Claudia? For the children? Yes. Look how pretty! Before they I never get it. continue our musical program. You are listening to music from memory. What are you looking for? An old art book, with the covers torn. Maybe Aunt Marta keep it. Why does everyone call her Aunt Marta if she isn't anyone's aunt? I do not know. Ana is her first husband's niece, and Claudia is her friend, she lived here for years. What does she do? She is a teacher. She also contributes for the expenses. They have great difficulty making ends meet. I found a boxing glove! It's mine! When I was young, I was an accomplished athlete. Light as a hare. What's wrong? Nothing. Why nothing? No, no, nothing. But how is it possible, Claudia? For 20 years, always every month, when you have periods, you get surprised you become a woman and no longer be a girl. That's not true! But what world do you think you live? In a fairy tale. What nonsense! Only happens when I do not feel well. That's it. The first time it happened to me I was in my room dark, blood stained thighs. I thought it was a divine punishment. My mother had not told me anything, of course. She spent the day arguing with my father. I hated her because of that, too. Listen! What is it? I do not know. I'm so tired I would not get up ever! Hey, you, get up, go! Let us not make my sister wait. And you tell me? Is you who have to fix the beard, I'm ready right away. The wound still hurts? No, only itches a little. How will we go to the restaurant, in the car? The car? What is the car worth? We'll walk. We have to go through a wood, and the sunset will be beautiful. Must have been nice, having spent childhood in a place like this. I'm ready. I have not exaggerated, no? No! We never go out at night, I don't know if... You're gorgeous, Aunt Marta! And smart! Really? Look at this, it's a sapphire, well, almost, was a gift from my second husband. Well, what is that? Curious? Want to know? Then, I did not know what it was for, but one day, being in Boston, I sang in Othello that year, I was in the dressing room when suddenly the ring opens. I look inside and see a white powder. Sugar, baking soda, I thought. I was so naive back then! I sniffed, tryed a little. Nothing. Perfect. I go on stage. And there, little by little I begin to feel within me a terrible heat, a kind of fire that consumes me and prevents me from thinking calmly I do not know, such a hesitation, that when the tenor, poor one, puts his hands around my neck, Desdemona, what does? Here, she holds all his parts! He got it! I swear! I swear it's a true story! They had to drop the curtain. Do you understand now why he always kissed my hand? And I thought, what wonderful man, what a compliment! Well, what he wanted was to suck these powders. Aunt Marta, you are unique. Do not make me laugh, all the mascara will run off. The table is served. Do not worry. After a while she will have forgotten. Look there. Ah, at last, ma'am! We were waiting for your, come, come to the table, here. I have booked you the honor place in the front row. Here, sit down, please. Over here, ma'am. In that table there is a very famous woman, I know her. -There. - Who is she? An opera singer. Look, son, this is an opera singer who was well known before. Look, lady, look what I brought. The characters who have honored me with their presence. Artists, athletes... A General, even Venice's patriarch. But for me, you will always be the most beautiful. More than the patriarch? You can not compare, but look, look at this picture, What grace, what elegance! What memories! In Carmen. When was this exactly? I do not know, I was not born yet. Come on, liar! If you would like to remember, here is one where the lady is even younger and prettier. Look, the Manon. My favorite. I see. The only problem here is that this is not me, she is my eternal rival, Mingoci. That's impossible, I swear on my grave...! God, give me that picture! Excuse me, ma'am, it was a mistake, what a scandal! I do not know how it got here this photo. For God's love, a second-rate singer in the same album as a lady your class! Out, out, out! For me she is dead and buried! Please accept my apologies. Excuse me, ma'am. Yes? My sister says you sing opera, and would like your autograph. With pleasure. Where? She's that one on white veil. But she's the bride! Yes, and he's in my regiment. I see. Good afternoon! Best wishes! Good afternoon, ma'am, and thank you! Thank you, singer, thanks! What an honor, how exciting! Shut up, mongoloid! Marita, please just note that now he is your husband. Because of you, because if for me, I would not marry him even dead. By the way, darling, how are you feeling now? And how can I feel? Pregnant. Here, the autograph. Thanks, you're an angel. Hold this, please. Please accept it, on the house. Thank you very much. You are very nice, kid. She, who we love so much, should give us a beautiful song. She is always the best because she has... What is it? The voice! A beautiful voice! Well, yes, her "thing" is golden. What? The "thing" is golden? What "thing"? The voice, the voice, the voice I mean. Ah, the voice, it was the voice! I thank you, my son, but you know, as time passes it has spoiled a bit, the voice too, the years pass. Do not listen to her, for us time stands still. Right, Anna? Well, it seems. Come on, Marta, be kind, sing something, if not, they'll think you've offended. But Niki, treasure, it was so many years ago... Could it be you're scared? Scared, me? You'll see the good thing. Piccio, please give me this red rose. Right now, ma'am. -Here. -Thanks. Music! Give me your arm. And, what do you want me to do? I would not be alone making the fool, dance, dance! Bravo, great, fantastic! Thank you, ma'am! They need you in the kitchen. And you, come here, boy. Marta, come. Come here. Let's dance, just a few steps, without singing. No, Niki, no, please. -No, Niki, I don't feel like. -Now, for a laugh. Dance with me. Tango, one two three! Look at them! Have you seen? Yes, they are extraordinary. Ana, look at them! I thought she was just a singer. No, she is everything. At last! She's tired. Right. Bravo, Marta. What's wrong? Nothing. -Aunt Marta... - What? Tomorrow, the trip to Venice... Niki is back... you are here. And what happens? How I wish everything was this way for ever! Always, always, always! For you, lady! You have been really fantastic. This is horrible. God, I'm out of breath on two little steps! But, where are the girls? Here they come. But why do not you get them to dance? Niki, what's wrong, you're tired? You too? Me never. So I like it, bravo! Oh, my dear Piccio! Old age is a terrible thing. You will never be old, lady. This is precisely what worries me. What time we'll arrive tomorrow to Venice? I do not know, when we want. At noon, at one... I guess I'll live until then. Come on, go dancing you too. - What? -Come on, go with them. All right, ma'am. With your permission. Sorry. Goodnight, Nicky. How are you? It's me, Rosino. He is my son. What are you doing there hiding? Go play with your gun, go, go. You would not have recognized me, eh? Frankly... I know. I know. Well, here they are my five children. That one over there, the bride, the soldier the curly hair one and then this one here, the last of the family. They call him uncle. Why uncle? Because the bride is expecting a child in a few months he will be uncle. Our little uncle. Go on, go to your mother. Teresa... I'm so glad to see you again! You want a piece of cake? No, thanks. A glass of champagne? I do not drink. Oh, yeah, that's why! That's why you are still so young, and such hair! He jumps, dance, hop!, jumps out to dance a tango... I've seen you before, you know? I thought to say hello, but then I saw there was your mother, so... My mother died giving birth to me. What? That is my sister Marta. Ah, just what I had thought, she is still kept in shape! She is very pretty. Enough, enough, I'm sick of you. Marieta, it was only a game. It was just a joke. With jokes at home, I was not amused. I see you're busy. No, it's nothing serious. Come, chat. Tell me, do you remember the naked women pictures? And to think we were altar boys... You were. Yes, you're right. How I liked the red coat! Jesus Christ could not take it away. It was so sexy... Come, my dear, what have you, eh? I want a divorce. Okay, we'll divorce. And stay home with you. Great, your husband we throw him down from the bell tower, as a paratrooper, who cares... Yes, it does not matter... But you liked him, when you were doing love... Dad! Oh, he's an intelligent man, he is not surprised by these things, he is the brother of the singer that you like so much. Oh yeah?, You see, I too should be a singer, so I would get famous, rich, and not be obliged to marry. Do you like my dress? Yes, very much. I've copied it from "Shinning Husbands." You have done well. Come, kiss me, it's good luck to kiss the bride. Pork will be the guy! Have you seen, Dad? I barely turn, and he focuses on fooling around with that slut. - Bepi! - Yes, honey? Come here a moment. What, dear? What happens?, As if you did not know. They are madly in love. They will be happy together. Now I must go, Rosino. We should meet more often, Niki. I am station chief in Bra. At 30 miles, it's near. Agreed. Maybe tomorrow? Tomorrow we're going to Venice. Too bad. As kids we lived there with my father. Marta insists that we get back. Tell me, havnt't you get upset to see me old? What? Time passes for everyone. Right. What's done is done. I always tell my children Forget the father, forget about the mother, forget about Venice, you have to look forward never back. Good. Where's Mom? She got mad at you and gone to the bathroom. See? Always the same story. I can not talk to anyone, she is jealous even of the air I breathe. You have married? No. You did well! If I were born again, I would like to stay single, no doubt. Alone. Will you excuse me a moment? I'm back in a while. Alone! Come on, make peace at once, it's not good to fight, come on. You both have everything to be happy. Come on, kiss. Everybody must see. You're a fake, liar! Get out of here! Away, away! Fake! Goodbye, Niki! Remember, eh? Do not worry. I wait for you, whenever you want. Thank you. Good evening, ma'am. Good night. No, no, I woldn't even ask. Thank you. It should be for you, Niki. Tell your father thanks. What's your name, honey? He would not say it. Calmly, slowly. I like it, I really like, Piccio. My God, we will kill ourselves. What now, Piccio, what do I do now? Quiet, we're not that fast. It's a matter of getting used to, like everything else. What will I do when you're not here to teach me? Super drive, you already can drive us to Venice. How am I, Catarina? Wrong. Why? A lady does not go out properly on the street without pamela. Pamela? What pamela, Caterina? My God! My school hat! But where did you get it, Caterina? Put it on. On another occasion. You know that convertible cars you're at wind's will, it blows hard and we are in danger of losing it. This beautiful hat. Niki! Get downstairs right now. Caterina, we're going to Venice do not serve the table, and do not be angry with us if we don't return for dinner. Got it? Aunt Marta! Niki..., you're still not ready? I'm ready. Where is Aunt Marta? Do not forget your rubber soles shoes. For God's sake, Caterina! Venice is full of water. Okay, thank you very much. Aunt Marta, what are you waiting? Do you want we never get there? Aunt Marta... Aunt Marta! Aunt Marta! Aunt Marta? Be careful, break! This way, this way! Slow down, slow down! Doctor, excuse me, but it is difficult to find an open pharmacy on Sunday. Is this useful for you? Yes. You've said a 10 percent solution. Yes, yes, this can be useful. Come, help me. Right now. Caterina, the door. Niki... What can I do, Caterina? What do you want to do, my son, what would you do? Pray. Here we are, son, here we are. Lord, bless my mother, who is in heaven with you. Bless also my father and my sister Marta who are still in this world. And always protect our house, street Equiab?n 24, A stairs, apartment 9. Cool, you gave the address too? Yes, because I believed in God. When my dog was hit by a car, I knelt beside him, I closed my eyes, and gradually began to feel something inside me as a kind of heat, a joy. Yes, joy! The dog raised his legs and tail and made "bup." How "bup"? He was cured. You do not believe me, right? Sure, Niki, of course I believe you. But in our house we don't used to pray. Does it seem ridiculous to you? Of course not! Damage can not do. Of course. But maybe it's not worthwhile. For Aunt Marta? A lady who welcomed me with such warmth and sympathy, and sure she understood everything about everyone, I'll become priest if it helps. I, I have no children that compensate in part for her death. I know, I know. If Marta leaves me alone, what I can stick to? Nothing! I was hoping you'd say "me." By God, Niki, with you I do not know what to say if I say something, you get angry, What am I supposed to...? Pray this prayer, please, it's me who asks you. Whatever. Ok. Do you mind closing the window? Why? Just me. Nor is it a seance. I know, but I feel more relaxed. So, and the door too. So. No one will interrupt us. Well, I'm ready. You're a good guy. How long have we known each other? Some three years. Ah, yes. If I were in heaven would I hear you? You, you would. Well? Very simple. You should concentrate, to think of Marta, and say what you feel. Do it standing, kneeling, sitting? As you wish. Loud? It is not necessary. And... hey...How do you get to recognize that famous happyness? It's a matter of feeling it. You too? Sure. Ok. Sorry, Niki, sorry, but I think I can not. You know, Piccio? Yes? On second thought, maybe that dog was not dead. I can go in? Who is it? Caterina. What happens? Nothing, I have to take the sheets of the closet. -Come. -No, no, wait, dear lady, I'll open in a while. Sorry, Niki. So. Done. I do it for Caterina. That's better. I'll open right now, ma'am. Go, go ahead. The booking sheets we save them here, this is for us a kind of wardrobe. Sure. Can I help? I can take the sheets. You hand me that blanket and also give me the pillow. -Ok. -Marta has stained the bed once again. Oh, you have to have patience, my children! Okay, thanks. And what says the doctor? The doctor is happy, very happy. Thank you, it's everything . He says that Marta is very strong physically iron made. It takes more to kill such a woman, she's is like a rock. But who would think to put these doors? I wonder how they'll get to put in the coffin by here. There. I've cleaned up. Do you want help? No thanks, I manage myself. All right. I'm going to make tea. Yes, but do not eat cookies, they are for me. Agreed. Ana! What are you doing here? You promised me you would go to rest. You're pale and have dark circles, you should get some sleep. -Ok. -Instead of tea I've prepared a chamomile tea, it will help you sleep. Torture is good, but beyond a certain limit is useless. The Charity begins with oneself. Is it true or not? You taught me. Ana, Ana! No answer, eh? Quiet. Now I can mourn, despair, you don't care a bit. Come, eat the frost cake, after all I bought it for you. Yes, you have the same character as your father you both only care about your own pleasure, others do not count for you. Also, what has she that I have not, eh? She's thin, pale, always silent the very hypocritical, She plays the violin! This is the violin that he likes, and this is where he comes back, dear! I'm still young, and desirable. Look what breats! To you I breastfed for eight months, remember, without a wet nurse. Come, eat. Anina... Yes? Did you do a favor to your mother? Yes. Come here, listen. Come, little girl, come here, listen carefully. Phone Dad, you're innocent, and perhaps he will listen to you, you call him and say: Dad, but how could you behave like a pig how can you prefer a tart over my dear mother? But you know what you've done. Mom has cut his veins, and is now dying in a pool of blood. Do you understand? How? Anina, listen, I promise that if you phone him this time I'll really cut my veins. I swear! So you would have not told any lies. Okay, nobody wants to help me. I'll have to do it myself. Anywayl, who has lived alone, alone has to die. But then do not regret, do not call me "Mom" because it will be too late. Okay, that's it. It's over, now I'll take the whole bottle of sleeping pills. 10, 20 pills if necessary. You'll be happy when you see me dying foaming at the mouth. What a mess of soap, my God! Look how stupid you make me! Do you think your mother is crazy? No, not crazy, your mother is a poor woman deceived by a scoundrel, suffering for love. But we do not care, he has left us and we must travel. Alone! To Paris. We'll walk together, very chic, come, Anina. Come, give me your hand. And everybody will look at us and say in French what a beauty... What elegance... Sure they are sisters. And we answer: bonjour, monsieur, bonjour, Madame. And then we go into a cafe in the sun, completely dressed in white and we'll be very happy. I'm here. I have put a drop of wallerian, that will help you sleep and will soothe your nerves. Thanks, I'll drink it later. You say later? Chamomile is to drink it hot else it is useless. Agree, agree. Ana, Ana, your problem is you do not want anyone to help you, that's the truth. But now we have to be closer. I'm very fond of Aunt Marta as much as you but sooner or later, our time comes, and we must be ready. When? How when? When will we be ready? But I do not understand, Anina, what do you mean? Forget it. Ana, my dear... We are not girls! And I'm not yours! Claudia, please! Give it to me. - Do you burn? -Yes. I did'n thought so, sorry, Ani?a. Wait, dear, wait. Let's cool it. So, so. Let me go, no! I want the glass vial, says Marta. Yeah, so where do I get the glass vial? I seemed to have been in the garden. Her first husband, at the last moment, wanted to have his dog to the bedside. The dog? Asked the priest. Your father really was smart. Your father left written the doctor had to hole the heart after death, just in case. And they would also like Marta. The dead with the dead and the living with the living, no need to build scandals. Eh! I brought you a rose. Red rose, warm heart. Voila! In this realm of pure glass I will read the future of Miss Marta whose birthday is today, to delight of his dad. You recognize me, right? Sure, Dad! Thank goodness. Abracadabra crowbar, Will she be rich, yes or no? Yes, very rich! Then, come in, richnessh. Abracadabra crowbar, Will she be beautiful, yes or no? Yes, very beautiful. Then, beautyness, come in. Abracadabra crowbar, Will she be loved, or not? Yes, very much loved! Then, love, come in. And that's not all, my daughter. What do you mean by it's not all? I think I see something else here. And who are you? Where do you come from? Shut up, no one should bother me while I work. I think it's even a prince. Who cares? Will you shut up? Unless... We must be very careful, my child, because often the appearances are deceiving. Abracadabra crowbar, Are you a frog, yes or no? No, he is a prince! A prince! Where is your horse? Here I am! Here! So, it's true. But you, prince Niki, What else can you offer to your sister? Marta already has wealth beauty, love... Me? I am the best, Dad, I offer she everything. Come in, doctor. What are you doing? Nothing, why? The door was closed. I know. I have closed so no-one bothers me. But I have called. But I haven't heard you, it's raining, you know? Yes, yes, sorry, sorry. I know I should not have come, but as we spent two days without seeing you in the house... Well, it is natural that one... I hid here as a child. You have cut your hair. Yes, I wanted to change a bit, although the result was not very good. How is Niki? Well, he is worried about you. Why me? And he insists that you come to Milan. Yes, yes, I know, Niki said it, and I thank you very much, but it's not possible. Why? Because I'm not ready. Because I fear. Because would not work out fine. At home there is room for everyone. Niki could not, with all his travels, and basically, he never moved from here. Always the same face, always the same body but persecuted for years by other faces and other bodies. No offense, Piccio, but when you Niki goes to bed with you he embraces a dream. What does it matter? I, however, I've only met Claudia in my life. I've only made love to her. And I began to hate her, as I hate myself, the day that Aunt Marta began to die. That's not true. Look, Piccio, look! this is my parents' portrait, Do you know who took out his eyes 20 years ago? Claudia and I, we did it in this very room! Any changes by our side, grows, matures, dies but we do not. No, we will remain always the same. Ridiculous and sinister, like two girls in a cemetery stone. Who says so? We have never known anything different from us, anything that is real. In fact, I think we could live simply looking at us in a mirror. Want some wine? Yes, thanks. Do you like to drink? A little. To encourage me from time to time. - God! - What happens? Ah, nothing. An old Aunt Marta's record, Niki has found it this morning. -Here. -Thanks. Such beautiful hands! Yes, a farmer's hands. Absolutely not! If I give you a slap you end on the ground there. I do not think you're stronger than me. Look. Yes, I've noticed. You're vain, huh? Why? Well, you love to be watched. A little, yes, and instead you're afraid. Me? You do not know me. What is it, eh? Now who's afraid? I have no fear! Who's afraid? Nor would you be the first woman. I know, I know. But it's just childish to get naked that way. These things you only when you're a child. You're right. There's a time for each thing. Look at this. Look what a lot of hair. I could put them in a locket. My God! Wait, I want to get you more handsome. -But... -One moment. So. Much better. Why? I fits you, but you're very pale. Let's try the wine, wait. And now? Now nothing. It's too late. Go home. What is it now? Are you crying? I do not understand you at all, you know? I do not know if it's Aunt Marta's death a problem of yours, or both at once. Enough. Ana, do not cry so. Ana, please. No, that's enough. What's wrong? Ana, please I know it's my fault. I should not have come, right? You want me to quit, eh? - Do you want me to quit? - No! Stay here, Piccio, Stay here with me! Stay here! Help me, Piccio! "Come with us to Milan," yes, even crazy. 50 years ago I run after the kids, it is time to think a little of me. I'm going to visit my nephew, So I replied. He has a pharmacy, a piece of bread and an aspirin I will never lack. And you said it right. Thank you. And you, I let you break out. You were born in a cage, you'll die free. - Fly! - What are you doing? - Fly, air, fly! - But if he has never flown! Enjoy life you too. Gone! I fear. I know, I know. I've never seen Niki's house. Neither do I. We will have to meet new people, find another job. Later, Claudia, in any case later now it's only a test. And to our age it starts to be difficult. One is no longer able to change so, from one day to another. No, it takes time. Come, help me pack. I need you, Claudia. Niki, Niki! Do not you ever look at the clock? But Niki, What are you doing sitting there? Nothing, I... Caterina's nephew will bring us to the bus. Yes, yes, I know. Hurry, we only have 10 minutes. Come on, I'll help you. -Piccio. - Yes? Tell. I'm not going with you. What? When Marta was alive everything was different, I felt protected. Now I'm here in front row I do not know. I should get used to the idea, I should meditate on it. - Here? -Yes. You can not meditate in Milan? Piccio... And Ana, Claudia? We go to your home and you do not come. It's your home too, right? -Only a few days. - How many? Well, it depends on you. When are you going back for the car? When I find the spare part. Great, I'll wait for you, so we go back together. 30 years ago I wanted to read "Orlando Furioso" now I can. And also there is our work, and there's me, I feel comfortable with you. I laugh, I joke, I have fun. So. I'm a little tired of being young. Niki, Piccio! Here I am, I'm coming! -Hey, Niki... -Please. -Okay, but I'll phone. -Anytime. -You need something? -No, no, nothing. -But what I say to them? -The truth. As you say. I'm going. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Go. They are waiting for you. Go. Just coming. Here I am, we can already leave. I'll go at the back sit, ma'am, right? And Niki? Niki will come later. Why? He has things to do. What things? I do not know. Ah, I forgot the bag. But, can one know what happened? Nothing, nothing. Nothing happened. Goodbye, Niki, we wait for you! Is there nothing more? No, nothing more, thanks. Anyway, Caterina, are you sure you do not want to come with us? Yes. Okay, so we'll go for you. Next week, okay? You can invite us to dinner. At home. -Yes, at home, at home. -Not in a restaurant. -Okay. Thank you. Goodbye, Caterina. See you soon. Where is Marta? What? Marta. He could have come to say goodbye. Come on, it's time to go. - Go where? -Home. But if we just came from home...
