[ Sighs ] Are you sure Zane Levy is gonna like this dress ? Electra, you sat behind Zane in Latin class for four years, and you never even talked. And now he's supposed to, like, suddenly become a part of your life ? Well, my aunt talked to his grandma, and she said he just broke up with someone. Electra. Stranger things have happened. You haven't seen Zane in ten years. Well, that's not true. I bumped into him in 1989. Do I look terrible ? You look beautiful. You're always so perfect. Only since the plane crash. [ Sighs ] Clay, how ya doin' ? There was this old lady today crossin' the street. She was, uh, [ Scoffs ] really fuckin' old. I mean, decrepit. So, I figured I'd help her out. Kinda take her arm, and I start to help her across. And she pulled away from me, and she said, &quot;Fuck you. I can do it myself.&quot; And it wasn't an Alzheimer's thing. I didn't know old ladies said, &quot;Fuck you.&quot; Everybody says, &quot;Fuck you.&quot; Some people say, &quot;F you.&quot; I mean, here I am goin' out of my way so this old lady doesn't fall on her ass, and all she can say is, &quot;Fuck you&quot; ?

Mind if I make this a troika ? Oh, certainly. Sure. Lately, I've had a strong desire to buy large pieces of furniture... [ Laughs ] so the house doesn't look so empty. Oh, you have a house ? Yeah. And you, um, live alone ? Yeah. I bought a new bed. You know, I'm just so happy I ran into you. It's so difficult, you know, meeting people. [ Scoffs ] Tell me about it. Most of the guys I go out with are such jerks. The guys I go out with are jerks too. Great earrings. You know, maybe it's like hornets or wasps or-- Oh, my God ! I haven't seen you in ten years ! Oh, my God. I haven't seen you in ten years ! Do you remember Mr. Marple ? He's an assistant, uh, soccer coach ? I heard he went crazy. He thinks he's a cat now. - Kevin.

Yeah. It's so close to everything. We've got the mall right there, and Gymboree... and it only took us an hour to get here. An hour and five minutes, honey. This is our first time out in a long time. We're so lucky we found Amber to take care of Baby Tristan. - So you have an au pair ? - Oh, no. No. A baby-sitter. Yeah. You know what Baby Tristan said today ?

Just keep talking. Nice to meet you. What happened ? I don't know. The Winnies had to jettison back to Palatine. The baby-sitter called. Someone's trying to kill her or something. What ? [ Holly ] Tiffany was really looking forward to tonight. That's too bad. Who's hungry ? Dunc ? [ Duncan, Softly ] Yeah. Wow ! Yeah. This room's kinda famous. Really ? Yeah. All of high society used to hang here. [ Spits ] Your cabaret; You have your theater. Grandma Syd saw Caruso here. Really. Yeah. Now, they use it mostly for kickboxing. Hey, fuckface. Hey, jack wipe. What is up ? Hi, I'm Mollie Rusk. Clay Mellon. Nice to meet you. Duncan, how ya doin' ? This is my wife, Mollie. Mollie MacEldowney, hi. We're gettin' some chow. Uh, we're over at the, uh, at the Culture Club table. Hey, I ran into Pat Prince. Oh, how is Patrick ? - He's a doctor. - [ Laughs ] That was a good one. I'm serious. Mac and cheese. Have some, Zane. [ Zane ] Mm. Some people make it with provolone. Mm. Wings-- Get some before they're gone. I think this is made with mozzarella. Mm-hmm. I prefer mozzarella. Good stuff. What is that ? It's stringier. Hi. Do you have anything nonfat ? This is Chicago. Excuse me. So, how's the gay thing goin' ? I haven't dated anybody since the, uh, twin from hell. Oh. You're gay ? Yeah. But you were soccer. Yeah. The plane banked real sharp to the left. And there was this, uh, thumping noise. I figured it was nothing. But, then, suddenly, we dropped. It must have been about 5,000 feet in about a second. All of the dinner trays flew up and hit the ceiling. People were screaming and crying. They were hysterical. Then we heard this, uh, &quot;s-s-s-s&quot; noise. &quot;S-s-s-s. S-s-s-s.&quot; The plane was going like this. And then, boom ! We hit the ground. Debris was flying everywhere. Part of the fuselage went right past my head. We finally came to a stop, and there was smoke and sticky stuff... and I saw this big hole. So I unbuckled my seat belt, and I ran out of the plane. [ Laughs ] - [ Electra ] Hmm. - [ Woman Sighs ] - Ahh ! - [ Both Laugh ] You ran out of a plane... and now you're famous ? Well, it-it's not that simple. [ Laughs ] Did-Did you save anybody ? No. - Were you injured ? - No. [ Laughs ] Did you have to survive in the wild or something ? No. So, what's the big deal ? The big deal is... I was on a plane and it crashed. And ? Kevin. Kevin, you used to be so much fun in high school. Now, you're so... not. What ? Hey, you guys ! Duncan Shepard. Ron Dorpman. [ All Together ] Right ! Hey ! Hey, how's it going ? Okay. Good to see ya. Okay. Ron Dorpman. A/V. Oh, of course, yeah, the A/V guy. Yeah. Right. Good. Hi. How are you doing ? What are you doing these days ? I've been installing home theaters. That's what you did in high school. Right. Hold it out there like you're on a magazine. You just made that. I like that. [ Shutter Clicks ] Hi, Kevin. Kevin. I know it was you. I still have a scar on my back. What do you mean ? You spilled that beaker on purpose. Oh, that. That hurt ? So... I just sat there waiting for him. I didn't want to leave right away 'cause I thought he might be late. But after an hour-- That's the last time I meet a guy in the net. But that was then and this is now. Holly has showed me all about positive thinking. Now I know I'm gonna be involved with someone really great. Jon Rilke ! Look. There's light in the box. Ooh ! Ahh ! [ Laughs ] Not really. Oh, thank you. He sells carpeting... on television, I think. Uh, Ms. Petuto ? Oh, my God. It is you. I can't believe it. [ Laughs ] Um, um...

I think you did a great job. I mean, it must have been so hard finding everyone, tracking them down. - I tell ya. - Getting the hotel and the catering... and the band and... gosh, these lovely decorations. Oh. You like these ? Oh, yeah. - Well-- - You did good, Rob. Oh. You did real good. Oh. Wow ! Thank you, Grace. Well, okay, I'll uh, catch you kids later, right ? See you. Hi, Zimba. Hi. That happened to a friend of mine who, uh, ran a bee-pollen clinic, uh, for sort of, uh, waysided bees. Have you heard about this ? No, I would love-- Can you get me in touch with him ? Yeah. There's a whole thing with waysided bees, where bees are flying to the left too much. They keep flying in circles and end up in the wrong state, principally Rhode Island. I don't get the law of similars. I don't get the vital force. No one has shown that homeopathy fits into a scientific model. Some things can't be explained. You just have to accept them. I don't have much planned. Going to take the waters, perhaps a massage. Why don't you stay with me a couple days ? My house is right on the lake. You own a house on the lake ? Yes. Hey, we do too. Oh. Did you bring that from home ? Mm-hmm. Dunc ! Elliot D'Angelo. Hi ! How ya doing ? Great. What are you up to now ? I'm sifting through offers. Uh-huh. How about you ? You still working for your dad ? Yep. I actually took over the chain. We just sold two theaters in Highland Park. The market's a bitch though. I'm still trying to dump the one in Evanston. You're selling the Selwyn ? Yeah. Wow. You know, I used to go there when I was a kid. Yeah, my dad loved that place. He built it by hand, brick by brick. But he's retired, so fuck it. Could I get some sort of crepe-latke like-thing ? [ Laughs ] You guys. You-- Mmm. Okay. Here's something to think about while you're eating. Oh, and speaking of eating, make sure you try the flan. It's excellent. - [ Man ] You da man, Rob ! - Is anybody doing what they thought... they'd be doing... ten years ago ? [ Woman ] Sit down ! Gee, Rob. That is just a fascinating-- [ Both Snoring ] I think it is a fascinating topic. Who wants to have... a roundtable discussion ? Oh, right here. Come on. It'll be fun. I for for one am not doing what I thought I would be doing. I was sure I'd be a weatherperson. And now I give seminars. People pay you money to hear you speak ? Yes. I'm what they call an inspirational speaker. Now, who wants to go first ? [ Zane ] Oh, I think Clay does. How about Electra ? Uh, well. I, um, I thought I'd have some kids... and, uh, and a house, oh, and a husband, and, um, a really good job. Other than that, I'm pretty much on track. Well, stick with it, Electra. You can do anything. Maria. Oh, well. I expected to be spending much more time... in the Cote d'Azur. Yeah. You really need to work on that tan. I'd hope they had a dress code on the channel. And well, who could've predicted the Turkish problem. [ All ] Mmm. [ Kevin ] The turkey problem ? [ Clears Throat ] Turkey sandwich problems. Duncan. Hmm.
