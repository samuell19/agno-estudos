[Burt] Susan, how's it sounding out there? [Susan] You sound great Burt. Alright. Check check check. Loretta! I have been looking everywhere for you. Am I that hard to find? Everything's falling apart. Nothing's falling apart Gretchen. What about the ice, the music? The catering truck? The ice is going in the deer freezer, Burt is organizing the music, and Turner is cutting branches to make room for the catering Truck. Look, it's all planned out. Your grandparents anniversary will be perfect. Excuse me. [Loretta] Hey mom. Oh hi sweetie. Aren't those azaleas beautiful? They are mom, but I thought we were using cherry blossoms for the centerpieces? You don't think these azaleas are pretty? No I do, it's just, well azaleas are justso common around here. Aren't you a little bored of them? No, not really. I have an idea, we could put the azaleas by the photo booth. Oh! It's just I had the cherry blossoms shipped in from Oregan. Please use them for the centerpieces. Okay of course. Have you seen Wayne? I think he's finishing up with a guest. Have you told him yet? I'm going to. Oh Loretta. I can't wait for him forever. I've been trying for weeks mom, he keeps changing the subject. But this time now it's for sure? Honey you have to tell him. [Wayne] Hey Abby. Good girl Abby. [Turner] Hey Wayne, can you give me a hand? Yeah what do I pay you for? You can always fire me. Give my job to Abby. I'm not sure she would take the job and salary. (Laughter) Hey, you might wanna schedule regular maintenance for that gear. [Wayne] When something breaks let me know. It ain't a crime to think about tomorrow. [Wayne] And miss today? Hey I'm just your employee. But you own the inn now. It's a lot of responsibilities. You sound like Loretta. Smart woman. Smart man would already put a ring on her finger. Yeah, I'm just waiting for the right moment. Speak of the angel. Lori! You know how much l miss you today? Things go well with the guests? It's a great, fish are biting all day. I hear Gretchen'sparty was a blowout. Oh it's only 30 guests. Now it sounds like plenty to me. You know what, I was thinking, this winter when things slow down we should refurbish the old barn. Wayne... We could redo the wood, put in a bar, you could use it for events. We can't avoid talking about it forever. Yeah fine, fine, let's talk about it. Well it's a huge opportunity for me. There aren't opportunities here? I'd be working for one of the biggest event planners in the country. Yeah in Los Angeles. Loretta we can build the Sundown into something special. This is your hometown. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Of course it does. You took it. I leave next week. Okay. And what does that mean for... You have no idea how hard this decision was for me. No. If I don't do this, I'll always wonder whether I'm good enough. Yeah fine. You do whatever you got to. I'm sorry Wayne. Good morning Ms. Bennett. Good morning. Feeling okay? I'm fine. If you're getting sickl could always do the... I don't get sick. Now, what do we have for tomorrow? Zack Carroway'sbirthday party. Beverly Hills, invitation only. Bouncy castle arrives at8 a.m. followed by cake. Loretta. Yes Ms. Bennett. This isn't a presidential inauguration, it's an eight year olds birthday party. Which we are only doingso Zack's mommy and daddy will hire us for the Richmond Ball. I just like to be prepared. And that is wonderful. But remember, no plan survives contact with the enemy. (Loud sneeze) Still, I appreciate your hard work. Especially now that Dee Dee has retired. Right, have you chosen anyone to be the new lead planner? I don't know. You have someone in mind? Hello. Oh hi Lori, I hope I'mnot interrupting anything. Oh no no, I'm just finishing dinner. Pretty casual. So, how is the City of Angels? Yeah, every thing's great. Well you know, the Spring Festival's coming up. I sure wish you'd come home to visit. As soon as things slow down I promise. I know honey, you work so hard. Well I think it's finally paying off. I think Ms. Bennett'spromoting me to lead planner. Oh well that's great! You deserve it. I mean, I know they miss you here at the Sundown. How is everything over there? Well you could calland ask for yourself. I tried calling. [Susan] You tried two years ago. Well Wayne doesn't wanna talk. Well maybe he'll surprise you. Yeah maybe. Look, I gotta run, I love you mom. I love you too honey. I'm on my way, they took forever with your dry cleaning. (Loud sneeze) Ms. Bennett are you okay? I might be coming down with something. Oh if you don't feel up to making the party, I could totally handle it on my own. Loretta you sure? Absolutely, it's an eightyear olds birthday party. How bad could it be? I will remember this. Don't worry, I have it all under control. Okay. (Faint applause) There's no need to rush, there's plenty of cake for everyone. There ya go. Could you move the gifts inside please? Thank you. Oh this is Adelayand Adelay gets the special cake with no nuts. Oh! There ya go. [Girls] Oh no, the bouncy house! [Michelle] Is anybody in here? (Indistinct shouting) (cheering) [Loretta] Oh thank god. Thank you. Of course. Oh, so sorry, head in the clouds. Hold on a second. You might be looking for this. Oh my planner. Thank you. Hope you don't mind. I took a peak inside. Oh. Are you always so thorough? Afraid so. It's very impressive. I'm Paul Perenti. Perenti like the law firm? You've heard of us? Yeah, Adelay's your dau... Adelay's my niece, and this is my fianceMichelle Wellerson. The party is amazing. And the way that you fixed the bouncy castle. Oh well, thank my dad. He had me fixing engines soon as I could lift a wrench. Tomboy huh? Yeah big time. As a kid I practically lived in the woods. You grew up in the woods? Not literally. This is gonna be perfect. We have to go but we would love to discuss an event with you. Can you stop by my office tomorrow? Yeah, I think I have some time. Great, I'll have the garage reserve a space for Amy Bennett. Awesome meeting you, and look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Excuse me madam, I'mhere to offer you my eyes. Because after seeing you, I won't be needing them again. Hey Howard. Hey honey, I'm sorry I'm late. Audition went well? Well, you just saw it so, what'd you think? Oh stirring. Oh good. It was for a soap, so stirring was the goal. Go over the menu? Yeah, they're still serving brunch. Ah great, I love brunch. Is brunch so popular in LA because no one's up intime for breakfast? And mimosa's are fantastic. Speaking of fantasticl'm loving this suit. Oh it's my bosses. Why are you wearing your bosses clothes? Long story. Have you heard of Paul Perenti? I don't think so. Well he's one of the most powerful lawyers in the city. Go on. He mistook me for my boss today and I didn't correct him. Well look at you. He wants me, or Amy Bennett rather to come to his office tomorrow. [Howard] You have to go. [Loretta] Howard... Babe, this is why people come to LA. Okay, to become something we're not. I mean this could be your big break. Look, I'm seeing Amytomorrow morning anyway. I'll talk to her about it then and then we can go together. Okay fine, but I'm telling ya, I don't think that's the way... Crepes florentine. Loretta! Congratulations on the party! Zack's parents were thrilled. They just called to hire us for the Richmond Ball. That's wonderful. What's this I hear about you fixing a bouncy castle? Oh it was nothing. Actually, funny story. I met someone at the party... Wait, before we talk about the party, I have a surprise for you. You know I've been looking for a new lead planner. Yeah. Well, Elizabeth, can you come in here please? [Elizabeth] Sure. Elizabeth Nash, meet Loretta Johnson. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Elizabeth is our new lead planner. Amy tells me you're great. Elizabeth hastons of experience. You're gonna learn a lot from her. So what were you saying about the party? You met someone? It's not important. Okay. I have some swatches l wanna show you. Okay, it was great meeting you. Yeah. Hi this is Amy Bennet, I just wanted to confirm my appointment with Mr. Perenti this afternoon. Thank you. Sorry for the wait Ms. Bennett. Please, come on in. [Loretta] How'syour day going? Great, great, and you? Yeah fine, thank you. Please, have a seat. Thank you. [Michelle] Hi Amy. Hello. Let me tell you first off Amy, even though I'm a lawyer, I hate liars. Mr. Perenti, there's actually... So I apologize for lying to you. I told you Michellewas my fiance and technically we're not engaged. I'm not sure I understand. My father, Arthur, he's a bit old fashioned. Paul has received his blessing to marry me yet. That's where you come in. You want me to ask him for you? No, no, nothing like that. It's just, he's very hard to impress. Well if Paul Perentidoesn't impress him I'm not sure who could... My dad is not impressed by stuff like this. He's an outdoorsmanand Paul is... Not. Wait, Michelle Wellerson, your father is Arthur Wellerson the billionaire? Well he prefers Arthur Wellerson the philanthropist, yes. Arthur and I haven't exactly hit it off. And I think it's because we're doing things that I like. So I would like to plan a, what'd you call it? A retreat? A retreat is fine honey yes. Yes, a weekend outdoors, with hiking, and fishing, and get him in areally great mood. And if you can make Paullook more comfortable, all the better. He's very hard to impress. Yeah you mentioned that. Most LA event planners spend even less time outdoors than I do. But we were blown away with Zack's party. And when you mentioned that you grew up in the woods? We thought that you might be perfect. Okay so, just for my own... You want me to plan a retreat to make Paul look like an outdoors man so that your father will give him his blessing to marry you? It sounds crazy when you say it, but yeah. Well tell her about the wedding. Right, the wedding. Now we haven't chosen a firm to plan our wedding, if you can do this, I don't see why we can't hire you. To plan the WellersonPerenti wedding. Our wedding, yes. That will be one of the biggest wedding's of the season. Yeah you flatter us, but we do expect it to be a pretty good party. So, can you please help us out? There's something l have to tell... Sorry, sorry. Everything okay Amy? Yeah, I have to tell you, I can't wait to get started. Fantastic! Thank you so much. You have no idea what this means to us. Well great. What have I done? You told a white lie, it's not that big a deal. I pretended to be my boss to get work from a high powered attorney. He could sue me for fraud. Okay fine. A gray lie. Oh my god. You can't forget these alright. You're gonna need your energy. Where do you keep your heels? Back of the closet. Don't think of it as lying okay? Think of it as saving your boss a lot of work. Well if I pull this off Ms. Bennett will get to plan one of the biggest weddings of the year. Ah, you see, it's a win win. And this can just be a funny story we tell the company Christmas parties. That's my girl. Alright, try these. It's a hiking lodge Howard. I can't wear high heels. Honey, see you're thinking like Loretta Johnson though. Okay you need to start thinking like Amy Bennett. Hey what if I came with you? Oh I could be Amy's assistant. I don't think we should stack anymore lies onto this than we have to. Look, I gotta shoot in Memphis this weekend anyway okay. And it's been six months. I gotta see your hometown at some point. There's not much to see. Well if it produced a woman like you, I'm sure it's wonderful. You always did love azaleas. Loretta! Oh my goodness! Hi! Why didn't you tell me you were coming home? Are you here for the spring festival? Not exactly. [Susan] Wow. [Loretta] Yeah. And I have to call you Amy? Only in front of Paul and Arthur. Are you sure you just can't tell them the truth? If I tell the truth now they'll call my boss and I'll get fired. Oh wow. Think Wayne will go for it? I'm not sure he's gonna have a choice. What do you mean? Well, don't tell him I said this, but since you've been gone, Sundown's not doing so well. What? Well Wayne, he's great with the outdoors stuff but you know Wayne. He's just not organized enough to keep up with the events. No, you two were a great team. Do you still help out over there? No, not so much. I think Wayne's afraid that he can't afford to pay me. I had not idea the inn was in this much trouble. Oh honey, it's not your fault. What could you do? You're out there living in LA. Hello Wayne. You shouldn't be wearing high heels. Could stick in the mud and twist an ankle. Good to see you too. And you Abby! Trouble with the engine? Nothing I can't handle. If you want, I could take a look at it. [Wayne] What are you doing here Loretta? I have some work for you. Feel free to callour booking line. You mean your cellphone? It's a small operation. You never answer when I call. Can you blame me? Two clients, three days, deep pockets. You have been in LA too long if you think I care about deep pockets. They already gave me the deposit. Why did they give it to you for? You don't work here. I'm their event planner. Actually that's complicated. Complicated how? Well they think I'm my boss. So all this getup is some sort of disguise? And all you'd have to do is call me Amy. I am not interested. Safe travels Loretta. I'm glad you found yourself out there on the coast. How's the inn doing Wayne? What is that supposed to mean? Please. Okay it's three days. You could use the money to finally refurbish the old barn. I'm sorry, but weare all booked up. Have a safe trip home. It was good to see you Wayne. I mean it. That barn is long past due for some renovations. Sure is. I don't see why we couldn't fit in a couple more guests. Great, I already told them yes. They'll be here Friday. So what'd you tell your boss? I was going home for a quick vacation. And she believed that? I should visit more. That's fine. We'll see you every time you pretend to be your boss. Obviously my clients will stay in the main house. Oh really? Yeah for what they're paying? Fine, we have the Millers but I guess they can stay in one of the cottages. And I told my mom we'd hire her back on for the weekend. And here I thought l owned this place. Well we need her help. It can come out of my cut. When was the last time you dusted? I leave the windows open on Sundays. Yeah that's not how dust works. Fine, we'll, we'll do some dusting too. And now you don't like my coffee. Well, these guys drink French press coffee in an actual French cafe. They're not gonna drink Doug's Mellow Brew Mud. Well that's a shame'cause Doug makes a mean cup of coffee. What is all this? I'm working on the itinerary for the weekend. [Wayne] An itinerary? Yeah a schedule. Yeah I know what an itinerary is, why do we need one? Well, there's a lot riding on this weekend. Not just for me but for Paul too. You mentioned that Paul's gonna ask this billionaire Andrew... Arthur. Paul is gonna ask Arthur if he can marry his daughter and he wants to do it out here? Arthur's an outdoors man. Paul wants to show that he's capable in the outdoors. But he's not. That' why we need a plan. We need to put Paul in positions that make him look comfortable. Alright. You might be the event wizard, but out in the woods, that is my domain. I have never used an itinerary and I'm not gonna start now. I need to make a shopping list. Do you have any pens or are those not part of your domain? Drawer under the telephone. Thank you. No stamps. [Wayne] What? You got a passport? Once you left I thought it would be a good idea. So you would leave Saint Francisville? It's just a passport. So that's a no. You know, maybe I don't see much of a reason to go anyplace else. Well you must of thought about it. Didn't you say we've got some work to do? Let's take a look at that truck engine while we still have daylight. I told you I could handle that. Oh Wayne, are you still insecure about my superior mechanic skills? [Wayne] Look just, don't get electrocuted. [Loretta] Do you know nothing about engines? Honestly I just hope for the best. It works most of the time. Well maybe if you focused on the details a little more stuff would work all the time. Want me to start it for you? (Loud grunt) (engine turns) Hey sounds good. What do you say we take it for a test drive? No, no, I need to wash up before Turner and my mom get here. Come on Lori, quick spin. Fine. Well it seems to be working, so if I could just get back to the inn... What are you doing? You don't ever just waste 15 minutes? Look at where you are. The sky. These trees, this town. Saint Francisville is in my blood, you don't feel that? We should get back. Yeah sure, okay. So there we were lost, hungry. Tired. Dog tired. And Wayne wants to call Loretta. Oh I have had to wake up Loretta. That is not a decision you make lightly. So we're arguing, and who should appear but Loretta herself. You two, talk about a sad sight. Wayne says, "Honey, how did you find us?" And she says "Well you two are making so much racket" "I heard you clear from the tree line." (Laughter) So, Wayne says, "Honey, you said you wanted" "wild violets for your party." "And if it takes me all nightl'm gonna get you some." And Loretta says, "Well Wayne, that's very sweet "but when I said I wanted wild violets "I meant I wanted you to go in my mom's store" "and pick some up." (Laughter) Loretta, we're lost without you. It's great to have you back. Oh, Turner. I'm not back back. What do you mean? I'm only here for work. I go back to Los Angeles next week. Hey Turner. Hey, staying with your mom? My old room. Coming back home can be one heck of a thing. Everything good in LA? Yeah. Yeah I mean, my job's a little crazy, but I'm seeing someoneso that's nice. Really? Have you told Wayne? Well is hasn't come up. Wonder why that is? (Clears throat) I need a hammer and nails. Do I wanna know? The signs crooked. No. Wayne, it's hanging from a piece of twine. Exactly. The first thing you see you go okay at the Sundown Lodge I don't need to be perfect. Paul and Arthur are gonna be here any minute. I don't have time to argue with you about this. Check the barn, there should be some nails in the toolbox. [Loretta] Thank you. Put your shoes on. Hey you find anything? What? You said you were looking for nails. Oh yeah yeah, I found some. Well that's gonna have to wait. Your guests have arrived Ms. Bennett. Okay. Hello there. Mr. Wellerson? Guilty. You must be Amy Bennett. This is Wayne Hendricks, he owns the inn. Great to meet you Wayne. Looks like you've got a beautiful piece of property here. Thank you Arthur. And I'm sorry we're late. I wasn't driving. What's that? Oh, oh okay. Mrs. Johnson, could you show Mr. Wellerson to his room? Of course Ms. Bennett. It's right this way. Oh no no, I could not let you do that. Lead the way. Mr. Perenti, so glad you're here. Glad to be here Amy. Oh, you have a... Oops, I must have missed one. I'm Paul. Wayne. Are those new boots? Yup. Guy at the store said they were top of the line. Well new boots can blister your feet. I'll find you some old ones. Thanks. Well I just want you to know I'm a little nervous. After this weekend Arthur goes to Tanzania for two months. This is my last chance for a while. Don't worry, we're gonna show Arthur the time of his life. Was the journey okay? So we're supposed to make that guy look like an outdoors man? He looks like a mannequin in a hiking catalog. Please, don't embarrass him. I'm sure he'll do plenty well of that on his own. Alright, I'll see you outside Amy. I can't help but notice you've had your eyes up in the trees. Yeah there's a bird I'm looking for. Which one? You ever hear of apileated woodpecker? The same one as Woody Woodpecker? Very good. Yeah I hear you got 'em down here. Well not real active this time of year, but, one morning we can make a mission of finding one. Were the boots okay Mr. Perenti? It was fine. How much further? (Heavy breathing) Here. What? Trade packs with me, mines lighter. No really, I'm fine. The hike's at least another couple miles. Can we switch back once I catch my breath? Absolutely. Okay. Come on now. What, are you lagging behind already Paul? We're just getting started. Oh no, Mr. Perenticame back for me when I fell behind. He's like a gazelle. Arthur and I were just discussing the route. Aren't we taking the Gullawack? No Gullawack's barely a hike. Well as I said in my itinerary, the Gullawack's a goodwarmup for the hike. The Gullawack isn't gonna push a gazelle like Paul. Right Paul? How ya feeling Arthur? Hey, fresh as a daisy. What do you say we try a real hike? No trails, see where the trees lead us. See, that sounds like an adventure to me. All settled then. Let's go exploring. (Heavy breathing) Can we take a break? The gazelle wearing out? No, no, it's me. I have weak ankles. Great. Come on Paul. [Arthur] So did you grow up around here Amy? What, why do you ask? You seem to know your way around pretty well. I brought a lot of clients. You sure you didn't grow up around here because I had an ex-girlfriend and you are her spitting image. Must have one of those faces. Well that must be it. Well, if the lady's ankles have recovered, we should be heading home soon. Oh hey, how was the hike? Paul barely made it, the poor thing. Well I'm glad I made extra. There'll be some hungry boys. [Loretta] What'd you make? Spam sausage. Mom you didn't. Well we always used to serve spa m sausage on the first night. I don't want Paulto look squeamish in front of Arthur. Well he'll just have to make do. Okay don't lie, just don't get specific. Oh boy. Hello? [Michelle] Hey Amy, it's Michelle. [Loretta] Ohhey Ms. Wellerson. Soon to be Mrs. Perenti I hope. Oh sure, Arthur and Paulare really hitting it off. Oh god, that's such a relief. My father can bevery hard to impress. I better head back inside. We're about to sit down for dinner. Amy, please. I know this whole thing can seem antiquated, but promise me you will get Paul my father's blessing. I promise. Thank you. I'll talk to you soon. Well it sounds like Amy Bennett has everything under control. Yeah. [Arthur] Thank you Susan. Sorry, still work hours on the west coast. What?! They work in LA? Some of us actually work pretty hard Arthur. I know you do Paul. Just kidding around. This sausage smells great. Thank you, it's old recipe. While we have a moment, I thought we could gothrough the itinerary for the next couple of days. (Clears throat) Well, this looks, very detailed. I think what Amywants is for us to get the most out of our time here. What do you say we play things by ear? I need to narrow things down. Now there's a man after my own heart. You know what, I'll look over this later on alright? There's nothing wrong with having a few ideas. Sure I can't help with those dishes? Please, you're our guest. Alright. See y'all tomorrow. Goodnight Arthur. [Arthur] Goodnight. Hey careful, those are antiques. Come on, I called you Amy all night, I took your clients out for a great hike, what more do you want? You've been trying to humiliate Mr. Perenti since he got here. I am not trying to humiliate Paul! Keep your voice down. If this is how you treat guests no wonder the inn is in... No wonder the inn is what? Don't worry about it. You don't worry about anything right? Just play it by ear. Even if Paul gets Arthur'sblessing, then what? He spends the rest of his life pretending to be someone he's not? Why does that sound familiar? Loretta, I'm sorry. My dad told me you never see more stars than in a SaintFrancisville sky. That's kinda hard to argue on a night like this. But how would he know, he never left SaintFrancisville his entire life. That last summer I was here, I didn't wanna live my whole life and think I'd missed my chance to see the world. Don't stay out here too long. We got a big day tomorrow. I love these late harvest berries. They're like candy. Mom is everything okay? You should tell Arthurand Paul the truth. I want to, I do... Then why don't you? Your father and Iraised you to be honest. No matter the consequences. I'm going to tell them. I'm just waiting for the right moment. You don't need the right moment to tell the truth. I mean, you know. Something on your mind? I mean I remember you being bad but I don't remember you being this bad. Throwing arm muststill be asleep. Yeah, must be. You ever think about leaving Saint Francisville? Well I went to the Bahamas last December. You never told me that. What do you think I do when you shut down for the winter? Do you think I just roast pecans and twiddle my thumbs? I guess I'm crazy if you're thinking this town is all I need. Wayne. Look at where I'm standing. Home isn't where you go, it's where you come back. That's pretty good. Read it off a bottle cap. (Loud grunt) Good morning Arthur. Morning. [Loretta] Morning. What is this? Mi Esperanza, it's from Honduras. It's delicious Arthur. Mi Esperanza. This stuff's like35 bucks a pound. Well we wanted to make sure you're as comfortable as possible. I appreciate the gesture but, I just like my coffee a little simpler. I think we have simpler coffee lying around somewhere. Oh, hey you guys need to get ready to go. Why, where are we going? Port Hudson. Yes, it's part of Spring Festival. They're giving tours of civil war sights. Well yeah, it was on my itinerary. Itinerary yes. I told ya I'd look it over. More walking. Would you be joining us Amy? Sure. I'll change into something more comfortable and then... Actually Amy and I have some errands to run in town. We'll catch up with you in a bit. Doug's Mellow Brew Mud. I'm gonna have togive this a try. What are you doing? Well there are classic cars this year so I think if we go around the... Why don't you look with your eyes, not your itinerary. [Burt] Well I'll be. Good morning Burt. Loretta Johnson. I'd heard rumors. Good ears. News travels fastin a small town. Wow, truck looks great. Don't she? Yeah, see what happens when you take care of something? Remember Loretta's old car? You used to cruise around that little red Miata. I can't believe you remember my Miata. And your mom drives a two tone teal green Subaru station wagon. And your dad, he drove that 68 Chevy Nova SS, big block 396 rock crusher, four speed two door coupe. Got some work coming your way. Fixing up that old barn. Finally, you've only been talking about it for like two years. Well Lorettabrought some clients and they're overpaying frankly so... Don't sell yourself short Wayne. Sometimes, the good guys win. Y'all have a fun day. And you come back and see me. I will do. So good to see you. See ya bud, have fun. Alrighty. Gosh, I haven't seen Burt in so long. [Wayne] Oh wow! What a spread! You're so sweet. And Loretta, I haven't seen you in ages. Smell these pecans. I have got to get a jar. Of course. Alright, how much do I owe ya? After what you did for us, they're on the house. Thank you. Hey Wayne. Forgot to show you something. Come her real quick. Sure thing Burt. I will be right back. I wish you'd let us pay for those. Oh no way. When my husband broke his ankle, Wayne stepped up and helped out with our harvest. Free of charge! We would have been sunk without him. Sorry, Burt was just showing me pictures of his new plane. Burt has a plane? Yeah, yeah, this little crop duster he fixed up. He's been volunteering it to hospitals. Back and forth between Baton Rouge and Dallas and that sort of thing. Wow, Captain Burt. I know right? Well, we have bothered Mrs. Wilson long enough. Let's get moving. Stop. Don't forget your pecans. How could I. Thank you Mrs. Wilson. You're welcome, bye bye. Good to see you. Enjoy the festival. Wow that was very sweet of you to help Mrs. Wilson like you did. Well this is Saint Francisville. We help our neighbors. [Vendor] Thank you Wayne. Awe. Oh we can catch up with Paul and Arthur if we... Wait. Can I grab one of these? Wild violets. Took me a couple of years, but I finally found you some. Okay, what is this? Well it's the Spring Festival. No, this. I feel like you're playing mea Saint Francisville mix tape. After what you said about your father never leaving town I wanted to remind youthat Saint Francisville isn't the worst place to spend your life. Well that's very sweet. Oh. Five bucks. What? Oh man. Everything okay Mr. Perenti? Yeah yeah, just got a, I don't... Here. Any progress with Arthur on the walk? Not an inch. I don't mean toadd more pressure... I know. Michelle would marry me with or without Arthur's blessing. I just don't want to put her in that position. There's still time. Hey there's getting it out there. Yeah, a little better. It's kind of all on the rod tip isn't it? So what do you think of Paul? I think he's anice enough guy. Yeah he is. Just not the kind of guy I pictured marrying my daughter I guess. [Paul] Need any help with that? [Arthur] I got it. Sure is a pretty day huh? Yeah, sure is. Get any bites? Yeah, yeah. Lot of fun fishing. Yeah. Yeah it is. At least he's trying. Maybe that's the problem, he's trying too hard. You should tell him to be himself, he'd get a lot further that way. You know, I am out here every day and still I forget how pretty it can be. It's like I'm seeing it for the first time. A little knotted up. It came from Paul's reel. Oh boy. It's not that bad. You think you could give me a hand? You know the secret to untangling a knot? A knife? Yeah sure. You could always give up, cut it loose. Or you find where the lines starts. If you find where the line starts you can follow it all the way to the end. Yeah. I found the ring in your toolbox. Lori... You were gonna propose? Maybe it's a good thing I didn't. What do you mean? Well your big opportunity in LA, you would of had to choose. That wouldn't be fair to you. But you didn't know I was leaving. Why didn't you propose sooner? We had a good thing going. And it never really felt like the right moment. What if there's no such thing as the right moment? What if that's just an excuse we use to put off doing hard things? I need to tell Pauland Arthur the truth. Are you sure? It's gonna come out sooner or later. It might as well be sooner. That takes guts. Hello? [Amy] Hi. Who is this? Well who's this? [Amy] This is Amy Bennett, I was looking for Loretta. Where did I put that phone? Looking for this? Oh yeah thanks. Everything okay? I'm a little sore. Came in looking for some ice and then you got a phone call. Okay. From Amy Bennett. Don't worry I covered for you. Mr. Perenti I am so sorry. If this weekend hasn't been embarrassing enough for me... Look, I was gonna tell you... Why did you lie to me? I was mad at my boss for passing me up for promotion. I thought if I did this on my own, she could see that l could be more than just an assistant. You're her assistant. Oh that's just perfect. I'll talk to Arthurin the morning. And accept full responsibility. No. That'll make me look even worse. What do you want me to do? I guess just keep up the Amy Bennett act for the rest of the weekend. And then when we get back to LA we'll have a much longer conversation. [Loretta] I need you to keep calling me Amy. What happened to telling the truth? Paul found out last night. He's afraid it'll make him look bad. So Arthur's the only one that doesn't know? Yeah. You better hope he doesn't find out. I don't think he'd like being the only one not in on a secret. We are going to split up into groups of two so we can cover more woods. Arthur, you and Susan stick together. Paul, you're with Amy. Maybe Arthur and Paul could go together. I want one person in each group that knows the woods so nobody gets lost. I gave each one of you one of Abby's old dog trackers. If you see the wood pecker we don't wanna spook him so hit the button on the side. It'll come up on my phone and we will come find you. Now you could hook it on your belt and let's do it. After you Mrs. Johnson. Come on Paul. I'm sorry Mr. Perenti. I know this weekend hasn't exactly gone according to my plan. No it hasn't Amy, Loretta. But I tell you what. I would spend a thousand weekends like this for Michelle. She's lucky to have you. You ever felt that way about anyone? Or anything? I'm not sure. Well you did lie to further your career so you must want that pretty badly. Hey, something the matter ma'am? Are you always soset in your ways? I'm not so set in my ways. Oh I don't know about that. I think it's good to change the way we think from time to time. At least the way we think about people. Oh you mean Paul. I think you should give him a chance. I just want what's best for my daughter. And how would you know what's best for your daughter? We do the best we can but, at some point, they become their own person. So if Paul makes your daughter happy, maybe that's what's best for her. Oh shoot. Oh don't worry, it happens all the time. Would you pleasestop doing that? What? Telling me every thing's okay. I mess up I mess up. Sorry. Wait wait wait. Do you hear that? Pileated woodpecker. Got him! You're a wise woman Mrs. Johnson. Well maybe wisdom comes with age. Yeah, we both ought to be pretty wise then. (Laughter) Any luck? Awe no woodpeckers but, you know, a day spent in the woods is never wasted. I'm sorry Arthur. I thought we'd find one. Where's Amy and Paul? Oh we haven't seen them. Maybe I should. One sec. And that was Paul's tracker. He probably fell down and pushed the button. Or maybe he found a bird. Alright come on. You're absolutely sure? I'm sure. 'Cause a lot of different birds sound the same you know? Loretta, I know youthink I'm helpless. In your defense I've given you plenty of reason. But in this case I am sure okay. Okay. Oh good. Hey, you find anything? Paul thought he heard... I know what I heard. It's around here somewhere. It can be tough. The way the bird calls bounce around the trees. There it is! There it is. See. Wow. Well I'll be. Well look at that little cu tie. Paul how'd you know? I knew what I heard. I looked up the callonline this morning. Sounds almost like a monkey. Boy Paul! Wow. Awe you should see Tanzania Paul. Impalas, far as the eye can see. Herds of them. Really? Oh you've seen Impalas. Only in pictures. Well, pictures don't do 'em justice. I don't know what you told Arthur mom, but it did the trick. You have to tell Arthurthe truth about who you are. Mom please, Arthur and Paulare finally getting along. She's got a point Ms. Johnson. Oh what, now you too? Alright, I'm gonna go start dinner. See you two inside. She's right, this whole things gotten out of hand. If Paul already knows the truth, then Arthur, maybel'd wait until he signs the marriage license. God this weekend, I would never have beenable to do without you. Be careful, you aint'out of the woods yet. [Loretta] Are you expecting more guests? No. Howard? Howard! Well hello darling. I tried to call, believe me but, you know, service looks a little, a little spotty down here. Oh hey man, Howard Hodgekiss. Wayne Hendricks. I thought you were filming in Memphis? Yeah yeah I had the evening off so, you know, road trip. Yeah I missed you, Amy. Oh wait, Wayne knows who I am so you don't haveto call me Amy. Okay, got it. Our little secret huh? Wait a minute uh... Loretta's boyfriend, yeah. Yeah, I just hope she doesn't talk about me too much. [Loretta] Things are delicate right now. Delicate how? Well Mr. Perentiand Mr. Wellerson are finally getting along. Well what do youthink I'm gonna do? I just don't want a scene. Honey, why would l make a scene? Though I was thinking on the ride down here, would Amy Bennett really be dating an actor? Absolutely. Just hear me out. Or, would she be with, Pierce Bonham, galleria owner and aficienado. When Ms. Bennett first strode into my art gallery, it was like a masterpiece come to life. What was it you came in forthat first night my love? Was it a, oh a Monet print for your charity auction yes? Oh you remember it better than I do. And just like that, we fell in love. Where's your gallery Pierce? Small neighborhood. If you aren't from Los Angeles you... Silver Lake, Venice, Beverly Hills? Ms. Johnson, could youshow Pierce to his room? Absolutely. Pardon me. Right this way. Take your time. As much as you need. Well he's quite a character. Character's right. So you're dating Loretta. Who? Oh it's okay I'm Loretta's mother. Oh, oh hi. Wow, it's so nice to finally meet you. Finally? How long have you two been dating? Well April makes, about six months. Six months. Wow that sounds serious. Yeah, we're taking it pretty slow. Yes, I'd say very slow. She hasn't even mentioned you, much less brought you home to visit. Well look, I'vebeen wanting to come, but, you know Loretta. She just works so hard. Yes she does. Enjoy your stay. Okay. Wayne. Wayne talk to me. What's there to talk about? Pierce? He seems like a great guy. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I don't care. You might want to tell him to tone down the act though. So Howard's an actor, he can be a little dramatic. Oh he's an actor. 'Cause Pierce Bohnamreally had me fooled. You know you're kind of being a jerk. You never even asked if I was single. Kinda how Arthur never asked if you're really Amy Bennett? That's not the same thing and you know it. You're right, I'm sorry. You've got your life in LA, I've got my life here. I get that now. Hey. Hey. You didn't think that Pierce Bonham might have been a little bit much? My boyfriend. I didn't ask him to do that. Loretta. If a story starts with a lie, does it matter if it has a happy ending? I don't know Mr. Perenti. Neither do I. I don't know if Arthur'sever gonna think I'm good enough for his daughter. This weekend has been hard. But the hardest part by far has been being away from Michelle. Ask him for his blessing tonight. What if he says no? Then he says no. But you can waste your whole life waiting for the right moment. You have to ask him. You a picker? Yeah, I might of had a band back in college. Fire's going. You should come out and play something. No. I couldn't do that. Arthur, I could sure use a love song right about now. I might have one. Well I might be a little rusty so hang with me. ♪ Some things like diamond rings ♪ ♪ They cost a lot ♪ What I have to offer you ♪ Can't be bought ♪ To some it might not seem like much ♪ ♪ But someday girl you'll see ♪ Even little children know ♪ Best things in life are free ♪ I'll give you barefoot days ♪ With nothing to do ♪ Long lazy summer days ♪ Where the smallest dreams ♪ Come true ♪ We'll find a vision oh ♪ And a volcano ♪ Sunny skies so blue ♪ I'll give you barefoot days ♪ Spend them with you ♪ Ain't it funny how ♪ People try to put a price ♪ On everything (applause) Very nice. [Arthur] Thanks. Wow, is there anything that you can't do? Well, I'm not avery good dancer. Actually that's not true. I'm a great dancer. (Laughter) Arthur. Yeah Paul. There's something that I've been wanting... I'm sorry to interrupt. I just, I simply can't hold it in any longer. I was going to do this back in Los Angeles but, after hearing Arthur'ssong I just, I can't. I can't wait another minute. Amy Antoinette Bennett, will you marry me? Is this for real? [Paul] Congratulations. Yeah, I guess love is in the air huh? Was that real? What do you mean? Well was that Pierceproposing to Amy or was that Howardproposing to Loretta? Ah. You know, I got lost in the character. [Both] I can't marry you. Oh I'm so glad you said that. I've been hiding away. Not just from you but from myself too. I'm so sorry. Yeah it's been six months. Never thought to bring me here. This is your home. I guess you never saw me being a part of that. You know I think I got lost in Pierce and Amy because inside I kind of knew that Howard and Loretta... Weren't meant to be. It's alright. Alright, I'm gonna head out. Sorry Pierce is leaving ya with a bit of a mess. Oh don't worry about it. I could do with a plot twist anyway. We'll always have brunch. We'll always have brunch. (Laughter) Pierce had to head back to Memphis. He's sorry he couldn't stay for dinner. Oh well that's too bad. Hey Paul, before Piercestole the show out there, it seemed like there was something you were trying to say. There was. I mean, there is. Well go ahead. Excuse me. Before I bring out supper, I would like to propose a toast. First, to Arthur and to Paul. We sincerely hope that you had a really good time. It could not have been any better Susan. Really. And to Ms. Bennett. I know your own mother could not be here for your engagement so, I would like to congratulate you on her behalf. Now I can only say what I would say to my own daughter which is, you are my whole world. And I wish you the happiest life that you can ever imagine. I'm sorry, I can't do this. I should have done this a long time ago. My name is not Amy Bennett. It's Loretta Johnson. I grew up in SaintFrancisville Louisiana and this is my mother. Come on, what are you talking about? I pretended to be my boss so Mr. Perenti would hire me to plan this trip. I don't understand. You know about this Paul? Not at first. So you did know about this? Arthur, I eventually figured it out. Please, I would do anything for your daughter and I didn't wanna disrupt this weekend. Oh so you were all in on this? Well you must think I'ma pretty big joke huh? Hope you had a good laugh. Arthur, it's not like that. I'm really not in the mood for I told you so's. Actually I'm impressed. Impressed? This is a disaster. Yeah it's a disaster. But before it turned into a disaster, you showed those guys a great weekend. God, I don't know what to do. Well you know where those answers aren't? In that binder. The plan's kaput. And that leaves you withone option, to improvise. But I'm not like you. I don't just improvise. I plan things out. Loretta, listen to me. You are the smartest person that I know. If anybody can figure this out, it's you. Hey Wayne. What's Burt's phone number? Good morning. Loretta Johnson. I think we've met. You met Amy Bennett. Now you're meeting me. Well nice to meet you Loretta. There's someone here who wants to talk to you. I don't wanna talk to Paul. It's not Paul. Sweetheart! Hi dad! Well how... Fresh off a red eye. Oh there's a red eye from Los Angeles to Saint Francisville? LA to Dallas. My friend Burt picked her up in his plane so she could see you before you left for Tanzania. You flew an airplane in the middle of the night from Dallas Texas? He's from Saint Francisville. Neighbors help each other. I'm exhausted. So if you could hear what I have to say that would be great. All ears. I am going to marry Paul. And I'm not asking you, I'm letting you know. I love him dad. And he loves me. He came with you this weekend and he hates the outdoors. If you can't see what a great guy he is then, I'm sorry, we're gonna have to get married without your blessing. Come on out Paul. Are you gonna make my daughter happy? Yes sir. And I never meant anything more my entire life. Well, I know you don't need it, but you have my blessing. [Michelle] Thank you dad. Hello. Good morning Ms. Bennett. Loretta, I hope you're well rested, we have a lot of work to do. Actually there's something l have to tell you. I pretended to be you so that Mr. Perenti would hire me. Things are a whole lot simpler when you're a dog huh? But he has given us thePerenti Wellerson wedding. So that's what happened. If you want to fire me I understand. Wow. Yeah. You put at risk the integrity of my company, everything that I've worked for. I know, I'm sorry. Younger me would've done the same thing. So you're not firing me? Oh I do admit that thePerenti Wellerson wedding does soften the blow. Oh my god I can't believe it. I always knew that you were great with a plan. Very smart Loretta. I just needed to see yousail uncharted waters before I made you lead planner. You're making me lead planner? I know, shocked myself. I must be loopy from the flu meds? Wait, what about Elizabeth? She took a job doing Oktoberfest tours. Beer crazy that one. Thank you so much Ms. Bennett! You and your southern manners. You're coming back today right? My flight's in two hours. Great, I will see you in my office tomorrow. Lead planner. See ya there. Oh my god. Thanks for everything mom. Sweetheart, don't wait two years to visit next time. I won't, I promise. Heard you got that big promotion. How did you... I might have been eavesdropping. Wayne... On behalf of everybody from Saint Francisville Louisiana, let me just say congratulations. We couldn't be more proud of you. You deserve it. [Loretta] Thank you. So you see your lady off? Yeah, shouldn't be on a safari? Tanzania's not going anywhere. I wanna see if there's any fish left in this river. Sundown fever. I've seen it happen to better men than you. You have have you? You've traveled a lot. Seven continents. Well in all your travels, you ever feel like you lost track of home? Wayne, you know, when I was a kid I was sweet on this little girl Lucille. Lucille huh? Yeah. Me and Lucille were walking home from church one day and she pointed out a bird. Now we didn't have a clue what it was but, we just knew it looked like Woody Woodpecker. And that's not the best part. While I was looking at the bird, Lucille gave me a kiss right on the cheek. Arthur you dog. Yeah. Must have been quite a kiss. Lucille ended up becoming my wife. Wayne I've traveled the world over. You know I never forgot that pileated woodpecker, Lucille, or my hometown. Hey you better go get her kid. She's something special. We are gonna be burning a lot of midnight oil to plan Paul and Michelle's wedding and keep up with the other events. Yes ma'am. I had a thought. You take over the Richmond Ball. You're kidding. 2,000 guests, paparazzi, one night, all eyes on you. I was expecting a little bit more jumping up and down. This is your dream right? Right. Good. Alright, so what do you think about this with this? Yeah great. (Loud knocking) Wayne? Can I come in? Yeah. You got on an airplane? Security is... And is L A's weather always like this because that would drive me insane. What are you doing here? I wanted to see the ocean. And your mom told me about Pierce. You mean Howard. Guess things didn't work out. You flew across the country to talk to me about my breakup? No, no I flew across the country to tell you that I am crazy about you Loretta. All that wide open space, it feels empty without you. Now maybe I'm too late, maybe I missed my moment but, I just wanted totell you how I feel. And now I have. So... I quit my job. But you love your job. I know, it was everything l thought I wanted. So what's the plan? I don't have a plan. I don't know what's gonna happen next. All I know is, I wanna be with you. I wanna come home. Hey there beautiful. Hey. So glad Paul and Michelle decided to have their wedding here. Oh me too. And these azaleas, beautiful. They were mom's idea. Locally grown too. You nervous Arthur? No. No. Maybe. (Laughter) Don't lock your kneesand you'll be fine. She's all yours Paul. Thank you sir. Come on, I wanna show you something. I don't know what's more beautiful. This lake or you. You brought me all the way out here to tell me that? No, I brought out here to give you this. Now I don't know if the timing feels right. I just know that every moment with you feels right. I love you Loretta Johnson. I love you too Wayne Hendricks. I wanna show you the world. As long as wealways come back here. Will you marry me? Yes, absolutely.
