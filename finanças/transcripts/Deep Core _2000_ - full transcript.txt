Is there something wrong with the prototype? No, it's working perfectly well. Too well. That's part of the problem. We're still tapping deep-core oil and mineral reserves as per specifications. Yes, but we're going beyond the agreed-upon limits. I'm warning you, Alan. If you dig too deep, the ramifications will be irreversible. Good. Important safety tip. I'll make sure they don't dig too deep. - And how are you gonna oversee that? - That's what I do, Brian. Trust me on this. Keep up the good work. It's me. So, Mr. Simmons, I hope we can work things out. Bob, you want to head down to electrical? We got a little problem with 17. Thanks. At least we know you work. Mr. po, this is the main unit. Ah. May our futures shine bright with fortune, Mr. morrissey. Gentlemen, I suggest you clear the area. Brian, what the hell are you doing? Jesus. Oh, Jesus. Get out! Move! Move! Everybody clear the building! Get 'em out! Get them out! Everyone move, move, move! Get out now! What the hell are you doing? You are throwing away 15 years of research, 15 years of friendship on a bloody whim! I tried to talk to you, Alan. You wouldn't listen. You lost sight of what's important. You sold out. You are crazy! Jesus! We are losing 1,000 barrels a day. Keep your pants on. These things take time. But your men, they are crazy. They're exploding the wrong well. Bedecker! Bedecker! How's it hangin', bri? All right. Gonzalez here thinks you're putting it in the wrong hole. Really? Oh, that's what my ex-wife used to tell me. Go talk to Sam. Come on. Hey, Sam. Hey, Brian, you ready to rock? Gonzalez here seems to think we might have put the dynamite down the wrong well. What'd make you think that? The well outside is 50 meters from the one that is on fire. You got a well on fire? I'm just pullin' your chain, buddy. First of all, we ain't usin' dynamite. We're usin' a directional shape charge. And second, that well out there, that ain't a well... 'Cause it's drier than a nun's noodle. Damn, I'd like to meet the chowderhead who told him to drill there. That was me. Why, hell's bells, son. That was a damn good call. Saved us lots of dangerous work. See, at the bottom of this magnificently useless hole... Is a very useful fissure. Now how'd you know that'd be there? Anyhoo, this ol' fissure runs at a 22-degree diagonal slant... That lines up perfectly with the bottom of this here active well, which is, at the moment, doin' a pretty good impersonation of my butt... After eatin' a bowl of that diabolical menudo they serve on that truck. Got any questions? H-how do you know that the fissure's angle is correct? If I told you that, I wouldn't be makin' the big bucks, now would I? All right. Here we go. Fire in the hole. All right. Break's over. Let's get back to work. Pena, no smoking. - It's impossible. How did he know? - Sam? Hell, I stopped tryin' to figure him out a long time ago. Six, zero, four. I've got exterior temperature reading of 604 degrees celsius. Speed and depth? Sixty percent speed at twenty kilometers per hour, sixty-two clicks down. Your position's well within the safety parameters, Mac. - Six, six, two. - Well, that's just peachy keen. We've got 662 degrees outside and climbing. Now, maintain course, Mac. We've got you within five minutes of the target reserve. - Seven, zero, zero. - Seven, zero, zero. Repeat. Seven hundred degrees exterior temperature. I'm shuttin' this puppy down. Damn it! Get me morrissey on the horn. What's up? Exterior temp. Mac shut her down again. Am I gonna have to get a bloody shovel... And dig down there and kick his little white ass myself? It-it-it's... he's the skipper. He called it. Patch me through. Patch him through on 14. Morrissey, go on 14. What's wrong? What the hell do you think you're doing? We hit yellow line exterior temperature, 700 degrees. I shut down for protocol. Screw protocol. The heat shields are rated to take twice that. Nine-fifty and climbing. - Hold on. - what are you saying? Speak English. What are you saying? Speak English! Run up the temp. Get out! Too hot! Have to get out! Jesus. What's happening? What's happening? Somebody talk to me. - What's our e.T.A.? - We should be there in five minutes. It's spiking, 1,500 degrees celsius. Jesus Christ. What happened? What happened, people? I don't know. I got something. On screen. Everybody, clear out! Now! Oh, no. No. Tell the pilot not to land. Tell him not to land! Don't land. Yes, sir. Let's get it up. Pull up, Mac! Pull up! Altitude. Get up! Altitude! Get it up! Come on! Here's to the best damn wildcatters in the whole damn world. Here's to risking your life to make some other asshole rich. Hear! Hear! I think that we should strike out on our own. I think that we should find our own damn oil, drill our own damn well and make our own damn selves rich. Oh, see. That's a good idea. Have to call my investment banker in the morning. Hey, we could save our money. We could bank it all together. Yeah? How much you got saved from your last paycheck, bed wetter? By the way, this is your round. - Would you just... - Oh! - Would you put it on my account? - Oh! Here's the budding young capitalist with his hand out. - "I need some money." - You're pathetic. There you go, honey. Keep that. Well, who knows? Maybe one of these days one of us will win the lottery. The lottery. To the damn lottery. What is that? The mother ship? No, it's okay. Just ask for directions. Uh, you folks lost? Y-yeah. As a matter of fact, we are. Um, we're looking for... Guadelupe de Las, uh, cruces. Uh, cruces. Oh, man. Guadelupe de Las... You really are lost. You got a map? If we had a map, we wouldn't be lost. You know, I said to Henry to please stop a few hours back... So that you could get directions, but you wouldn't, would you? - So here we are, lost, and... - I don't speak Spanish, darling. No, no, no. It doesn't matter if you don't speak Spanish, honey, because... Directions are pictures. Well, no need to fight. Uh, go back about 20 Miles to this crossroad, turn left, head due east. You should get there in say... well, I don't know... two or three days. - East? - Where the sun rises, sweetheart. Yeah, I know where the sun rises, dear. I got it. - You sure, darling? - I'm sure. Dear. Thanks for the help. - Y'all on your honeymoon? - Yeah. How'd you know? Lucky guess. You know, the rosy glow of happiness. Hey, you, uh, done with that paper? Uh, well, I'm still working on the crossword, so, um... Give him the paper, lily. Darling, it's my... Crossword. Now. - Sweetie. Thanks. - Sure. Thank you. Good life! Why do you always tell me what I'm supposed to do? Whew! Mm. - I give it a few weeks. - I give it a few days. - I give it a few minutes. - Hey, give me the comics. There aren't any comics. This is the New York tribune. What the hell kind of fish wrap doesn't have funny pages? A grown-up newspaper. Here. Look at the sports. I'm an arts-and-leisure man myself. Really? Never would've figured that. Oh. I am a man of sublime refinement. Yeah. Shit. Hey, where are you goin'? What happened? What did you say? I didn't say anything. Is he in? Sir. Sir, you can't go in there. Sir! Hope you're happy with yourself. What are you doing here? You rebuilt the u.S.D.M., didn't you? Yeah, what do you expect me to do? You destroyed the whole damn thing. Congratulations. You just triggered global destabilization. Come on, Brian. That's just a theory. Don't give me your shit! Brian, you need psychological help! I'm calling the police. What about that island where you were drilling? Just disappeared? Should I call someone? I'll take care of this. There have already been earthquakes along the rim... Emanating out from where the island used to be. It's clear and damning as a fingerprint, pal. Really? You can't prove any of this. Maybe not now, but if my simulations are right, there are gonna be other quakes in southeast Asia, South America, central America, on up to north America. I've already contacted a.P. And CNN, given them times, places and magnitudes. Right now I'm probably the biggest nutcase on fire, but when this happens, they're gonna be real interested in talking to me... and you. There's still time, Alan. We can stop it. Maybe we should talk. We've stepped up work on the series two version... Of the u.S.D.M. At our facility in hainan. China? Yeah, the island off the Gulf of tonkin. That's where we're headed for now. R&ds have indicated that the vehicle should be up and on-line... Within a few hours of our arrival. It's good to have you back, Brian. I'd like to meet the guy who tried to duplicate my research, 'cause whoever he is, he's got his head up his ass. - Her ass. - Ah. Brian Goodman, meet the head of our research and development, Dr. Allison... Saunders. M.I.T., right? Yeah, I've, uh, seen a few of your papers in the journals. Really? Mm-hmm. I'm impressed. So what did you think? Never finished one. So it's a tight time-frame signature. At 3:39, the drilling catastrophe. At 4:05, the Tsunami hits Japan's Southern coast. Quakes here, here and along here... All due to the destabilization of the pacific. Yeah, the pacific rift. See, according to my calculations, we have approximately 48 hours before the, uh, next trembler hits, somewhere in the vicinity of, uh, central America. If it happens, we might know in 48 hours. If it does happen, you might as well say your prayers. What? This thing gets worse? Well, the continents, as we know them... Let's just say it would be a good time to invest in the map-making business. - That could really happen? - In theory. Other models show a relief in pressure. In fact, it may have already happened with the previous events. Maybe. Maybe not. Okay, fine. What do you geniuses think you can do about this? We take the series two vehicle from the hainan facility. We drill three deep core Wells here, here and here. That should vent the tectonic pressure and stabilize the plates. You gotta be kidding me! Now, you know, I don't have to take this. No, no, no, no, no. You've just breached the mantle. The earth's core is like an engine that's whining full-out in neutral. If you drill those holes... What'd you call them? Vents? You might as well call them afterburners. You've just created directional propulsion, like a jet, only you've dropped the engine from neutral down into drive. You've just accelerated the hell out of what you started. Okay, Mr. wizard. That's Dr. wizard to you. Dr. wizard. Now that you've trashed my idea, do you have a better one? I can only think of one. How far down are we? About 300 meters. A nuclear bomb? Are you out of your mind? No, not a nuclear bomb. We need a series of them. We need to synchronize detonations of precise seams along the plates. How do you plan to set off a synchronized detonation? You Daisy-chain them with fiber optics. And that should initiate a subtectonic wave form which should... Shift the pacific plate several Miles in a few minutes. Do you have any idea what that will do? Well, it should drive the plates right into the java trench. And that would cool the mantle. Jesus! Exactly. Well, would it work? Yeah. Yeah. It might. But where exactly do you expect to get these devices? Nukes-r-us? Unfortunately, I hadn't gotten that far yet. I'll take care of it. This way. What do you mean you'll take care of it? One phone call to our friends in Beijing, and we'll get whatever we need. And by the way, I've got some people in mind for the crew. All right. Well, there she is. God, I'm good. Please. False modesty doesn't become anyone, least of all you. Gotta give credit where credit is due. Thank you. When it's due. Let's get to work. I see you've made some modifications. Yeah. It took six months to recover your project data and your notes... And another year to get past your design flaws. You're not much of a practical engineer. Well, thank you. These heat shields? Uh-huh. Same as the space shuttle. With a few chemical modifications, it increases the specs to 2,500 degrees centigrade. How do you deal with the communications at these depths? Mmm. We hook it in up top, and we reel it out as we dig. Two coffee cans and a string. I love it. Primitive, but with the various strata of minerals, it's the best thing we've been able to come up with. That's brilliant. Sure you didn't go to Cal tech? I had a full ride at m.I.T. Why would I want to go to a second-rate institution? What? Hold on. What's that flash for? You know, I don't know. It was one of the modifications per the Chinese specs. No. You've misunderstood my question. Let me rephrase. What is a flange with seedings for explosive bolts doing on the back of a u.S.D.M.? They said something about a cargo hold. What would a drilling machine need a cargo hold for? Look, it was an easy alteration, so I made it. Ally's bringing a simulator on-line so you can get up to speed with the stick. We figure 12 hours to work with the crew. Okay, good. That'll give you eight hours of prep time. And, uh, 12 hours to seed the bombs. What's the e.T.A. On the nukes? They're already airborne. I reckon five hours from Beijing. Where were we? - Seeding the bombs. - Okay, so that gives you 12 hours... To clear before detonation with a two-hour safety margin. Two hours? Morning, gentlemen... And lady. I'd like to introduce Dr. Chang, physics; Dr. lu, seismology; Dr. Lee, demolition. I thought you should get to know each other, since you'll be... Simmons, could I have a word with you? What is it? Who are these guys? This is your team. This is... What happened to my guys? These people have been trained and cleared with security. Why do I get the feeling that their security clearance... Is more important than their training? You know it's not like that. We wouldn't pick these people if they weren't... This is the backup crew from the last mission. And we all know how well that went. Now, Mr. lu, we're gonna need to pinpoint the fissures... And pressure points right here along this Ridge, okay? Now the explosions will basically act like... Pushing the first domino in a long line of dominoes. You understand? Yes, sir, Mr. Goodman. Good. Chang, have you located the fissures with the correct mineral compositions? Yes, Mr. Goodman. Look, you can cut the Mr. Goodman crap, okay? I'm Brian. Call me Brian. All right? Yes, Mr. Goodman. I'm glad we understand each other. Mr. Lee, you're gonna arm the bombs... And drop them as we go. When you push that little button, it makes them blow up. And there's nothin' like a good explosion for a little entertainment. - Don't you agree? - Brian. No, just... I'm asking Mr. Lee. Do you understand? Uh, yes, sir, Mr. Goodman. And you think that's a good idea? Yes, sir, Mr. Goodman. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. You want to tell me what in the hell is going on? What do you mean? Well, those handpicked, security-approved scientists in there don't speak English. Well, they understand some and can speak a little. Work out the details in the simulator. Some and a little isn't gonna cut it, Alan. Your estimate was wrong. Ecuador just happened. Our deadline's been pushed. You're kidding me. Look, there's no time to work out the details with those guys in there. Either my team or no team, or you can put Saunders here in charge. What? You don't think I could be in charge? Look, that was never an option. If you can't even get on with him now, we're not gonna have a team. - Fine, then I'm not on the team. - No, I don't mean... I'll be in my quarters. Where in Ecuador? Quito. Quito. Exactly what I thought. If you want to scrub Saunders from the mission, I won't object. What? Are you kidding me? She's the one who built the machine. She's one hell of a mechanical engineer, which I am not. You never cease to surprise me, Brian. Well, I'd like to get out of this one alive. I mean, I'd like to save the world and everything too, but I'd also like to save my own hide. What was the magnitude of that quake? Um, 7.8. Do you have anyone else in mind? Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, I know just the guys. Oh, that's full. Okay, this is the last one. Are you Rodney debecker? De... debecker. Bedecker. Bedecker. Bedecker. Is that you? Uh, no. Uh, Rodney bedecker is in room number five. Well, we're in room number eight. Do you guys wanna have a drink? Hey, hey. Guys. Guys. Maybe we could let me put my pants on, huh? Hey, don't go anywhere! I'll be back! Adios, senor Rodney! Vaya con dios, pendejo! ♪ Damn. All right! All right! I'm comin'! Damn. For cryin' out loud! Somethin' tells me you're not here about the noise. Yeah? It's Saunders. Door's unlocked. Hi. Look, I just wanted to wish you luck. Okay, well, thanks 'cause we're gonna need it. Um, I'm trying to be a good sport about this, but I don't understand why you don't want me on the team. I would like the opportunity to change your mind. You are on the team. I am? Didn't Alan tell you? - No. I just assumed after... - See, that's the first law of science. Never assume anything. Didn't they teach you that at m. I.T... K-e-y... M-o-u-s-e? Okay. Why do you want me on the mission? Why? Because we like you. Now why don't you try and get some sleep? Look, I'm sorry I woke you up. It's okay. Really. Thanks. Night. Night. Ay-yi-yi. Hey, what kind of job you think Brian needs us for? Who the hell cares? Look around you, boy. This is how the other half lives. What other half? The half we ain't part of. Gentlemen, if you'd fasten your seat belts, we're making our final approach. Oh, man. Hey, don't you think you could circle the field a couple of times? - I'm afraid not. - Never mind him. He's just funnin' ya. No, I'm not. All right. Now you can land. There you go bein' selfish again. All right. Now you can land. Go on. Land the damn plane. We got us a job of work to do. Morrissey! Who gave you the authority to change the crew? If I hadn't, Goodman would have walked. Goodman's not the only man. I've got two qualified men in Beijing who could pilot that craft. It's not just about drmng that damn machine. Those explosives have to be placed at precise coordinates, and Brian's the only one who knows how to do that. Listen to me. And he needs to be able to communicate with the rest of his team. It's that simple. I should have been told. Tell you? Why don't you just call up Beijing and say, "mother may I"? We are working with these people. No. You're their puppet, Darryl. Who are these men? Specialists! Handpicked by Goodman. Best in the business. ♪ Sam, they've got nukes! We're using nukes. Wow. Just look at that fit and finish. That's better than your lexus. I don't think you could get a dime in there. I can't believe I was so stupid. Careful. Not in front of the c-h-i-n-e-s-e. Excuse me. Can you, uh, step aside, please? You speak English? Yeah. I went to Stanford. Oh, well, that's a good liberal arts school. That's pretty fast work. Not really. We've had two years to solve any design problems. Four-tenths of the magazines are pointing starboard, plus the 100 megaton which is located at the base of the pod. So that explains the explosive bolts. Uh, yeah. You want to be able to drop that pod... As soon as it initiates countdown sequence. - So what do you say we go check out the cockpit? - Sure. Thank you. I wasn't just blind. I was stupid. Don't be so hard on yourself. But I never meant for the u.S.D.M. To be a weapon. Well, obviously they did. It'd make a good one too. Think of it as the equivalent of a submarine, only instead of moving under the ocean, it moves under the earth. Oh, my God. Do you know what this means? We're not supposed to know. If they find out that we do, then morrissey and his Chinese partners... Are gonna have to cover their tracks. You don't think that Alan had anything to do with this, do you? Oh, come on, Goodman. How could he not know anything about this? Well, I've known him for a very long time. He may be ambitious, but he's not crazy. I'm gonna go do the final checks. So what do our Chinese friends want now? They're not too happy over this last deal. Let me explain something to you, morrissey. The u.S.D.M. Is a vital asset to them. When you pulled those men... I had no choice. When you pulled those men out, you made them nervous. And when they get nervous, they don't file lawsuits. They'll just put a bullet in your head. So what do they want us to do about it? Us? No, you. You screwed up, you fix it. You see, morrissey, there's more at stake here than just money, but you know that. Oh. ♪ Ah! There. You see? You can teach an old dog a new trick or two. Huh? T.K. Four, two, ones... And an eleven thirty-eight. It is gonna be so hard to go back to c4... After playin' with you guys. Halloween's over, Alan. I'm coming along, Brian. No way. Look, this is my machine. If I don't go, no one does. Look, everyone on the team is qualified to be on the team. That is the bottom line. - No. The bottom line is people have been - my father, my brother, you. I made this mess, Brian. I need to be part of the cleanup team. It's that simple. I'm not gonna let you risk your life. Well, do it as a favor then. - Do me the favor of letting me come along. - Brian, I've never asked you for anything before in my life. I need this. You did ask me for something once. Yeah, well, you know. Copying your homework doesn't count. Mm-mmm. Michelle's phone number, and I gave it to you. Yeah, but... that was no favor. Believe me. Thanks a lot, man. Yeah. All right. Let's get this show on the road. Start the countdown. Yes, sir. Any of you kids gotta go to the bathroom, I'd do it now. Sam, composition. Ninety-three percent shale and a pinch of obsidian, just to make it a bitch. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three... Two, one. Initiate drilling generator. - What do you say we put this bucket of bolts into drive? - Rock and roll. - Yee-haw! - Do it. Fifty-six degree inclination. All right. Take it to 60. Speed and heading? Eight Miles an hour, north, northwest. - Rodney, watch the cabin pressure. - I'm on it. - Sam, composition. - Granite, 77%. Ten percent shale and, oh, thirteen percent nickel. Short pocket. Hang on. Fissure comin' up. Heading two degrees starboard. Let's level her out. Depth? Four point three kilometers at seventeen kph. Comin' in on the first drop point in three, two, one. All right, Rodney. You're up. Hey, you got a please for me? You're gonna get an ass-whippin' if I hear any more back talk. Yes, sir. How ya enjoyin' the ride, blue eyes? - Yes, it's-it's good. - bombs away. I have always wanted to say that. Drilling telemetry, 70% output. Eighty-five, ninety-seven and stasis holding. Sam, give me a read on those compositions. Ninety-two percent granite, four percent limestone. Set pitch at point zero, zero, four. Alan, you got a depth reading back there? Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Four point eight. - Four point eight, one? Four point eight, two. - What? Four point eight, three. Four point eight, four. Eight, six. Rodney, offset the cabin pressure. Delay that. We're at one point two atmospheres. - I said offset the pressure. - One, two. I'm looking right at it. Then it's malfunctioning. Use your head. You know the depth. Calculate it. I'm running diagnostics. There's no time. Offset the pressure. They're 4.89. What the hell's he waiting for? - Ally, what are the calculations? - one, six. I fixed it. Number two on the hit parade. Somebody wanna tell me what that was all about? I'm sorry. I don't know. All right, Rodney. It's all you. I don't know what happened. We need to recalibrate. Give me an update. They just deployed the second device. Goodman, how's that vehicle holding up? Just some minor software problems so far. Any seismic readings we should worry about? There's been a series of small movements in the South China sea, but nothing abnormal. Nothing abnormal? You gotta keep us informed, okay? - You just do your job. I'll do mine. - That's fine. But we need to know about any disturbance. Are we understood? Man, it is hotter than Dutch love in here. Rodney, are those heat shields intact? Uh, yeah. They're fine. Why the hell is it so hot in here? Oh, the heat synch's aren't cycling. Sam, what's the exterior temp? Two, four, zero degrees. It's grinding. We must be caught on something. Shut all stations down now! - Why did they stop? - I don't know, sir. Goodman, what the hell's goin' on down there? Just give me a second. All right. What in the hell's goin' on here? Oh, looks like a chunk of corundum busted that u-joint. Can we fix it? I don't know. Looks pretty bad. Ally? We gotta try. All right. We got a major problem here. We just blew a tire. I want Saunders and another man on it right now. You got it. I'm on it. I'm going. No way. For Christ's sake, I'm in this too. Can't you just trust me? It's not it, Alan. Rodney, you wanna give her a hand? Yeah. Sure. Hey, watch out for heat buildup in them walls. Magma flow? I don't like the way this looks. Watch your back. Wanna keep an eye on the cabin pressure? Get me a time frame. Goodman, how long's it gonna take? As long as it takes. Desk jockey. Damn, it's hot in here. The u-joint is toast. How long's it gonna take? Twenty, twenty-five minutes. I'll tell you what. Make it 15 and Mr. wizard will show you his favorite magic trick. I thought that was Dr. wizard. Rodney, pick up the speed, dude. Thank you. Man! What's goin' on? Oh, I don't like it. Here we are down nearly 200 kilometers and there's no sign of mantle density. Look there. You're right. Flow channel. Exactly. What else? What else? I'm gettin' heat fluctuations all over the place. Shit. Let me use that. All right, guys. Wrap it up now. We're almost done. Another minute. All right. I'm gonna go back and look at the rear tread. This kettle's about to pop. Look, I said get the hell outta there right now! Oh, my God! They're down. Pocket's breached. Jesus. Brian! Brian! Philippines. Mount pinatubo just blew. Tell them to move outta there. Brian! Don't open that hatch. Brian, they're already dead! Brian, you gotta save the ship. Comp check. Bedecker's trapped in the flow. I don't see Saunders. We gotta go, man. I gotta see for myself. Goodman, come in. Goodman? Anybody in the cockpit, come in. This is the u.S.D.M. We have a serious problem. We're trying to fix it. Morrissey, I want that vehicle moved outta there right now. We do not leave our people. Morrissey, can you hear me? Morrissey? Morrissey, get outta there. This vehicle ain't budgin'. You can't move it from up there, sir. The girl's dead. Get outta there. Morrissey! All right, Sam, get us the hell outta here. You got it, Brian. Okay, let's get this moving, Sam. Come on. You okay? Rodney. I know. It's okay. Come on, now. We gotta get outta here. You okay? She's fine. We clear the magma flow? We cleared the flow. We're coming up on drop point number three now. Okay, shut her down. Bedecker was one hell of a wildcatter. Yes, he was. None better. It's me. Goodman, it's Simmons. What went wrong down there? We lost Rodney. Look, mount pinatubo just blew. What? Mount pinatubo. That means we're just about out of time. Was there any damage to the vehicle? No, we're just fine. Thanks. Who are these partners of yours anyway... Who care more about the safety of the vehicle than our lives? I guess it's pretty obvious now they're not Chinese businessmen. I guess I knew all along. I decided to turn a blind eye. They're the Chinese government. Jesus, I ain't no big fan of the U.S. government, but I'd draw the line at being a traitor. What's their agenda? Agenda? Once the mission is successfully completed, they're gonna take control of the ship. - And use it as a weapon? - Yeah. Let me ask you this. Is there any way that they can detonate those nukes from up top? No... They could do it through the fiber-optic line. I'll just cut that bastard. No, no, you can't do that. It's a fail-safe. A dead-man trigger. If you cut that line, it starts a countdown... five minutes. No way we can clear the blast area after that. That never seemed the least bit suspicious to you? My back was up against the wall, Brian. We gotta get moving. We're running outta time. Someone's going to have to deploy the nukes. You know, I can handle it. I'm going to need you at your station. You too, Sam. We're comin' up on the most critical of the drop points. Well, that leaves me. Well, I guess we don't have any choice. Let's get it movin'. The devil you know. You said it, brother man. Device number three. Deployment is a go. - Third device deployed. - it's for you. Beijing. I'll take it in the ready room. Mr. Simmons, I trust we are on schedule. Yes. Yes, we are. We, uh, had some technical problems, but they've been solved. Three of the four devices have been deployed. What about our other technical difficulties? That's been taken care of. We would be very disappointed if the vessel doesn't come back into our hands. Very disappointed. I can assure you, colonel, that if we don't recover the unit, no one will. I hope so, Mr. Simmons, for your sake. - Hey, Brian, you got a minute? - What's up? That drillin' generator can dissolve pretty much anything? Just about. - What are the exceptions? - Crystalline structures mostly. Emerald or topaz. Corundum. Carbon? Coal, yeah. Diamonds, no. I think we got a problem. Why? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Uh-huh. Wow. What are you gonna do? I don't know. Talk about your solitaires. Must be Miles wide. Well, if it's quartz, maybe we can dust it. Oh, that's not quartz. How do you know? Trust me, I'm a woman. We'll have to make sure. We'll have to go out and get a sample. How long will it take? Well, take a lot less time than it would to navigate around it. Sam. Yep. Hello, kitty! Wow. She was right. This ain't quartz. How much does it weigh? Fifteen pounds. Let's not get too excited, old buddy. Don't forget. We may not make it. We've got a real problem. At current speed, it should take us 11 hours to drive around it. That's great. By that time, Las Vegas will be a beach resort. - Yeah? - We're gonna have to take a long detour. Reports from California. They just had a major episode along the coast. I got some more bad news for you, Goodman. Your California prediction just came true. You got enough time down there to deploy those other two devices? We're going to have to burn the engines to keep on that time frame. Just do what you have to do, and keep me posted. We have an additional problem, the fiber-optic communications line. What about it? They'll run out of cable before they finish seeding the bombs. How much is left? Seventeen kilometers. If he maintains full speed, they'll be gone in less than an hour, which will initiate the countdown sequence. Who signed off on that? On what, sir? On the specs, the fiber-optic specs. Who signed off? Colonel po did, sir. You sure about that? Yes. Something wrong? No. If we don't get those nukes set, there's not gonna be much to go home for. You sure these engines can take the pressure? They can take it. We're pushing her hard, but she should hold out long enough to outrun the blast. Revvin' up on position number four right now. All righty. All right, Alan, break's over. I'm on it. Four little piggies away. One fat boy to go. Bring up the communication camera and patch me into the pod. Doin' it now. Morrissey. Don't worry. They can't see you or hear me. - What do you want, Darryl? - We have a little problem. Something that might dissolve our partnership. You know, now that you mention it, dissolving our partnership isn't such a bad idea. You can keep the Chinese. I'll take my business elsewhere. You won't be taking your business anywhere. Stop playing games, Darryl. I'm not playing games. Watch this. That detour you took cost you more than time, my friend. Oh, Jesus! Je... What the hell's going on? The countdown for fat boy's been initiated. Someone shut off the alarm! That limey bastard cut that fiber-optic cable. He's the only one back there. This is not making any sense at all. Take over the controls. What the hell are you doin' to us? I messed up. I really did lose sight of what was important. Come on. Let's get out of here. Oh, no, no. Can't do that. I said let's get out of here. Now! Back up! Stay there. Don't move any closer. What are you gonna do, kill us all? You still don't trust me, huh? Just leave me here, Brian. No way. Shut up and listen to me for a change. I can buy you 20 minutes by tying up the system with a diagnostics program. But I'm gonna have to baby-sit that myself. That's the best I can do. It's up to you guys. Brian, for once in my life, you know... Just for once... Let me be the hero. You don't have to do this, Alan. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do. Alan! Shut her down, Sam. Someone jettisoned the bomb pod. I'm gonna get back there and see what's going on. What are you doin'? Going to see what happened to you. Get back to your stations. Where's morrissey? He's baby-sitting. He's what? I'll tell ya about it later. Let's just get this thing out of here. Hey, Brian, I want to bring something up on your screen. You see those channels? They carry magma from the mantle on up to the lithosphere and then up to the surface. There's only one way to put any serious distance between ourselves and that blast. - Don't even say it. - We could ride the lava flow to the surface. Oh, my God. You guys are nuts! Mama don't surf? You designed those heat shields. Time to put them to the test. They haven't been rated for that kind of sustained heat. - Have you got any better ideas? - Look, we got 16 minutes. Sam, find me a lava flow. Yes, sir. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. What happened? No detonation. All right, people, listen up. Unless you have a level five security clearance, I want you out of this building right now. - Let's go! - I want every document in this room shredded. You understand me? Yes, sir. - I got a heat source. - What's the heading? - Two o'clock, one click. - All right. Hold on. Hold tight. It's really gonna get rough now. Yeah! Hold on! - Mr. Simmons. - What is it? We have detonation. Hold on! Ally, you okay? Are we okay? What a rush. - Whoo! We made it! - Oh, we're okay. Let's get outta here. Yeah. We made it. I'm gonna try to get somebody on the horn down here. Hey, Brian, I got the coast guard on the horn. Brian? Hey, Brian, coast guard needs to talk to mission commander. Brian? Y'all up there? Colonel po! I didn't expect you to fly down here yourself. We were unable to retrieve the unit, but we did manage to destroy it. Satellite reconnaissance reported both American and Russian elite naval teams... Recovering the craft this afternoon. How do you explain this? That's impossible. There's no way in hell that ship could have escaped that explosion. Nevertheless, Mr. Simmons, it has come to pass. What are you saying, that it's my fault? You forget, colonel, that it was you who signed off on the fiber optics. I say we drill right there. I'm the oldest. And I say we drill right here, and I've got a phd. Well, I got two phds, and I say the old man here is, uh... Oh, that is so typical. - Wrong. You're dead wrong, Sam. - Wrong? Oh, Brian. Now, you've looked at this. Look at it for real. Look at this structure. Forget the map. Come over here. Let me show you something. Sam? Don't "Sam" me. Just hear me out. Sam? There will be no oil east of this. See where that green place is? There's no oil in here. Sam, you're a chauvinist. Let's get this show on the road. You just do your job, and I'll do mine. Michelle... the phone number, and I gave it to you. Yeah, that was... That was no favor, believe me. So, can this monkey read? All right. Now you can land the plane. I hope so, Mr. Simmons, for your sake. ♪ Something tells me ♪ ♪ You're not here about the noise ♪ Is that right?
