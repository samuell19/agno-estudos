Another one, Miss Winter? Well, I really have to go. Now, what good is one drink without one for the road? Besides, I haven't finished telling you what a great little car this is. 'Member when we were riding on the highway this morning? I told you about that new gear shift in there? Power of the pick-up, too? Did you feel it was a light car, easy to drive? Yes, yes, yes! It's a... Tell me more, Mr. Dunn. I just love to be talked into things. All right. Hey, Don! How was Palm Springs? Very funny. You were supposed to go out on a demonstration, not a tour. She took the wheel. Liked it too. Oh, she took the wheel, liked it too. When are you gonna learn? A beautiful dame like that doesn't come into a joint like this wasting her time auditioning cars! She's bored! She sleeps till noon. She's got nothing to do for the rest of the day, so she cruises around, gloms onto some good-looking slob like you, burns my gas and your dough! By 7:00 o'clock she'll find some other pigeon who will buy her dinner. Look, Mr. Haym... Save your pitch for the live ones, sucker! Go and get supper, and be back here tonight. That you, Nick? Yeah, it's me. Brightest husband you ever married. Tell Mama. How's Davey? The same. He's sleeping now, first time all day. You know, I must be losing my touch or getting old. So, who didn't you sell? Ah, it's who sold me! What a hunk of stuff. Built like a hard top convertible. I was pushing an $8,000 sports job. I even went first cabin with a round of drinks at Jack's At The Beach. End of story? We drove back to the lot, she thanked me very much, stepped into the most beautiful Chrysler you've ever seen and left me standing there with egg on my face and Hayman in my hair. Oh, is that all? I thought you were gonna say you got fired. Well, don't lose faith. That'll probably be the next step. Brash. Oh, relax, honey, I'll take care of Davey. Look, you finish fixing dinner, huh? I got to get back to the lot. As I understand it, this is on special, marked down to $700. It's a cute little car. How does it run? Well... "Well," what? Every hear of Torrey Pines? It's down the coast, where they hold the sports car races. I'm not a sports car fan. Matter of fact, I've never driven a foreign car. Just had an impulse toward one, that's all. Well, that kind of impulse could come pretty high. I don't think $700 is... Look, Mr. Markel. This car's a bad risk, unless you're a good mechanic. Looks pretty good to me. Well, sure, it looks pretty good. It's rolled over four times. You know, I appreciate your telling me all this. Look, we got plenty of cars here, good ones. Fine. Suppose I come back tomorrow when I've got more time? Dunn! So where's the $700? Oh, I got him interested in another car. Better one. I don't care about the other cars, he was all set for the MG! That's the one I'm trying to get rid of. Well, isn't it better to sell a car for 1,500 than one for seven? Now you're going to tell me what's best for my business. I'm only doing what's best for you and what's best for me. The more I sell... The more you sell! With your records of walkaways a day I can starve to death. But first you, then me, Don! You're through! That's all right with me. I like to sleep nights. Hey, more. Well, here we go. Told you I was psychic about Hayman. Oh, you'll get another job. Please, a choice! How much money we got in the bank? Dollars or cents? Add 'em together. You wouldn't be happy, we'll just make it to the first. Yeah, that's the trouble with dopes like us. Too much month at the end of our money. Hey, here's one: "Salesman wanted. "Home appliance. "Quick turnover, big commission." Eh, get this! "$500 required for inventory." Guy's got to rob a bank to afford a job like that. Ah... You know, I better stick to something I know: selling cars. You take Davey to the doctor today, don't you? Mm-hm. Well, if he doesn't come up with an answer today, I say get a new doctor. I don't like the way Davey's been looking, acting, anything. Oh, he's a good doctor, Nick. It's just that he wants to work things his way first. Before he gets us involved in a lot of tests and things. He knows we haven't any money. Well, you tell him he doesn't have to be that charitable. I'll get a job and I'll get the money. Hello? Who's calling, please? A Mr. Markel. Hello? Yes, Mr. Markel. Yes, it's Nick Dunn. Oh, how could I forget? That MG cost me my job. 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, sixth floor. Uh-huh. 9:00 o'clock sharp. Oh, I'll be there, Mr. Markel. Thank you. A job? I don't know, I hope so. He went back to Hayman's looking for me, and Hayman gave him the number. Oh, Nick! Hey, you treat me like that every time I lose my job, I'll be getting myself fired regularly. Your former boss tried awfully hard to sell me that MG, but I went back looking for you. With what's under the hood of those cars he handles, he must have a relative who owns a mortuary. That's what impressed me about you, Mr. Dunn. You leveled with me. You know, it's not easy to find a man who has an honest face and an honest soul to go with it. I think I can use you. Doing what? Selling used cars. Oh. Yes, I was just window shopping, seeing how the competition worked... and keeping my eyes open for a good salesman. Well, what do you think, Mr. Dunn? Would you like to work for me? Even if you had two heads. I've got a wife and boy, and the boy's sick. We don't know what's wrong, but it's gonna take a lot of money to find out. I guess I'm just one of those guys that can't afford the luxury of unemployment insurance. Well, maybe you won't have to. I own a... chain of used car lots. California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico. Any man who works out good for me can go only in one direction: up. Well, that'll be a change for me, Mr. Markel. What was your deal with "Big John"? Well, I got 75 a week and a straight 5% after the first 1,000. I see. All right, you'll start at 100. I... don't like percentages. It gives a man too much incentive to chisel and not give the customer a good buy. But you work out the way I think you will, and you'll get yourself a good bonus. You just bought yourself a loyal employee, Mr. Markel. Fine, just see that you stay that way. Oh, Miss Stewart, will you call Mr. Ward and tell him I'm sending a Mr. Nick Dunn to see him? Miss Stewart will give you the address. Well, thank you very much, sir. I'll be seeing you, Nick. Thank you. Hello? Good morning, did I awaken you? Mm-hm. Well, here's something to start your day off right. You know that 180 pound bundle of honesty you found for me? Well, I think he's going to turn into a uranium mine. How nice for you. How nice for you, little girl. You know that blue mink stole? Oh, yes! Get it. Oh, Uncle Arthur, baby! I can really have it? Be wearing it tonight when I pick you up for dinner. Goodbye. Mr. Ward? You the one Mr. Markel sent down? Yes, sir, Nick Dunn. Say, you've got some nice merchandise here. Every car that rolls off this lot carries a new car guarantee. Good break for the customer. Eh, works both ways. If a car is letter-perfect we can afford to carry the paper. What are the mark ups? We beat the competition, Dunn. Lower prices in wholesale. I get it. Make up the difference in the financing, huh? Uh-huh. And if a customer's got a good credit standing, we don't worry about a big down payment. Who is Markel, Santa Claus? You short on dough? Well, I... Here's a week's advance. Mr. Markel doesn't like his salesmen worrying about anything except selling cars. Likes the way you sell 'em, real honest. That's what we need in this business: real, honest salesmen. Well, I... Give Miss Rogers your Social Security number, tax deductions, then I'll give you a rundown. Thanks. Thank you, Mr. Dunn. I'm happy you're satisfied. Goodbye, Mrs. Richards. Now remember, if you have any trouble with the car, just bring it back in. You've got a new car guarantee. Thank you, bye. Thanks again. Hello? May I help you? Who owns the lot? O'Toole. Name's Davenport. Police? Well, just a wee step above. Auto theft detail, State. Oh, well, my name is Dunn, Nick Dunn. This is a routine check. I'm working my way south from San Francisco trying to run down a number of stolen cars. Any of those look familiar? No, not right off. Recall anybody trying to peddle any of the cars on that list? Well, they wouldn't come here. Who can figure those jokers, sir? Liable to try to sell 'em back to the guys they stole 'em from. One thing, there's a real cozy hot car racket working the state. Sooner or later somebody's gonna get their neck barbecued. Look, you run across any of those cars, contact me, will you? You fellows can be a big help. I'll keep my eyes open. Yeah, thanks. Dunn, wasn't it? Yeah, Nick Dunn. We're switching nights off, Dunn. I have to leave now. Oh, I can't tonight, Smiley. Look, I haven't taken my wife out in two months. We got a babysitter and, well, any other night, okay, but I promised her. So break it. As if you weren't married to her. Look, Mr. Markel wants me over at the Alhambra lot. You cover the beat here. They're sending in a shipment of cars. Okay. Hey, man, turn those lights off. Just a minute, what's the gimmick? You don't argue with me, man. We just turn off the lights. We got a policy, man. Whenever a load of cars is being delivered, we lock up at the regular time and just wait. What for? Suppose somebody's here. Customer, maybe. We don't like customers, man. Not when we're unloading, oh no, we don't. Give me a hand, will you, son? Take 'em off and line 'em up. All there is to it. We'll be out of here in an hour. Come on, man! Well, man, I gotta say, you moved those things the most. Oh, yes you did. Yeah, "man." Suppose you do the same. Don't push me, man, don't push me. Be friendly. Like my own brother. Well, well, well. Things must really be slowing down, you're still cruising around looking for a pigeon at this hour. You lack the proper emotional approach, Mr. Dunn. I was just driving by, saw you were about to go in the office and remembered. I thought maybe you had something to show me. Yeah... the exit. It's that way. Now, don't be that way. Do you always sell every car you demonstrate? No, but then, I don't always get taken for a ride either. Now look, you don't need me for what you want. This may come to you as a big blow, but I've got my mind on other things tonight. Put it on me. I'll buy you the drink this time. You couldn't charge it off as entertainment on your income tax. I've got a wife and son to go home to. So? You've got a look that looks like trouble. I may even save you from doing something or saying something you might be sorry for. Just one. Just to cool off. Thanks, Paul. Cheers again, Nick. Last one. There's still a character I have to see tonight. Must you? I told you I'm married. I have a terrible memory. All kidding aside, I'm glad you came by when you did. Well, that's a slight improvement, anyway. Yeah, if I'd gone to see him then, I... probably would have pushed his face in. This way, I'll only think about it. Really that serious? Look me up again some time, only try another car lot. And thanks. So nice to have been had. Paul. Yes, Miss Winter? May I use your telephone, please? Sure. Now Paul, my glass is lonesome. So you were looking for an honest man? Some stupid jerk like me to front for a deep freeze to cool off hot cars? Well, you picked the wrong guy. Get yourself another boy. Nick. What's the matter with you? Don't you like money? Are you unpatriotic or something? Don't you like Washington, Lincoln, Jackson? Sure, I like a buck. I like it real nice. But not that much to get my picture printed up with a serial number on it. I don't understand you, Nick. We're not hurting anyone. We pick up a car, the owner's covered by insurance. We sell it, the buyer gets a good deal. Nobody gets hurt. We're helping! Yeah? Well, not me. Oh, and don't worry, I won't go to the D.A. like he was my psychiatrist. You said I was an honest man. So I made a mistake about you. I'm not gonna cry over it. Goodbye, MisterMarkel. Nick, Nick! Hey... Where were you? I tried to reach you! Now what's the matter? David, it's David, Nick! Well, what about David? He had a sudden attack! He's at the hospital. The doctor said he had to go, he's under observation and they may have to operate! Nick, they... they don't know! "They don't know" what? If Davey will live. He was so helpless when the ambulance came and they took him to the hospital. All the way I held him in my arms. I stayed until he went to sleep and they sent me home. I wanted to stay but they wouldn't let me! Nick, I'm scared! Don't you worry, honey. Davey is going to get everything he needs. He'll live. I promise you. I was pretty upset, Mr. Markel. I was mad. After all, no guy likes to be taken. Made a sucker of. Does your wife know about this? No, she's got enough to worry about. Look, if you'll still have me, I'd... Well, I'd like to have my job back. Why? 'Cause I've got a boy who may die. I need money, and a lot of it. I don't care where it comes from. Hot cars, cold cars or whose money it is, as long as I get my hands on it. About $5,000 I should say, wouldn't you? At least that's according to the doctor's report. Dr. Reynolds, isn't it? St. Francis Hospital. "Patient's name: David Dunn. "Diagnosis... Skip it, Markel. So you knew. And you let me come back. You sat right there and watched me rub my face in the dirt. Why, MisterMarkel? You get your kicks seeing a man sell his life away? I'm sorry, Nick. But I've got to be sure of my people. First, I had to test your honesty, then I had to see what kind of a father you really are. Did I pass the test? All A's, Nick. You go right to the head of the class. This we call the refrigeration plant. Here we take hot cars and cool them off, then we put 'em back together again. Here's the genius of the place. Mr. Markel. Otto, this is Mr. Dunn. The new manager of our downtown lot. As of now. You see? I told you I was going to promote you. Mr. Dunn, I'm glad to meet you. Otto. Lead on, Otto, we'll follow you. First, the cars, we pick them apart. Here... he files away the serial number. Otto's a perfectionist. Nothing ever gets by you, does it, Otto? It's my job, Mr. Markel. You do a thing right or you don't do it. Sometimes we switch bodies. A complete reconversion. Mr. Dunn, we do everything except change the name of the car. Over here, back for a paint job. Even the leather, when she's heated, exchange. If slipcovers won't work, we sometimes do a complete reupholstery. No sir, not a detail overlooked. Is there something else what you want, Mr. Markel? No, no, Otto, just a sightseeing tour. Then goodbye, I got work to do. Bye, Mr. Dunn. He's really got it. That's why he's the boss here. I put a man in charge, he's in charge. That's why you're in charge of your lot. Do things your way. The more cars you sell, the more you make. Here... this is Otto's domain. Nobody tells him what to do, not even me. How about the papers on these cars? Among the Markel enterprises there's a printing and engraving company. We have our own registration and title service. You don't miss much, do you? Not a thing. Otherwise, we wouldn't have a business. A legitimate business, that is. Hello, honey? Me. I'm trapped. We can't go tonight. Look, give the sitter a rain check. Look, and tell her the next time we may even have a television set she can watch. Well, of course it's another woman. What'd you think it was, business? Not too unhappy. Good girl. Goodbye. See you later. Charm. That's what it is, sheer charm. Remember that when you get married, Miss Rogers. That's just the time he may not be telling the truth. Well, now for the newlyweds to be. Give them my regrets! Now, now! Let's don't have any bitterness in this organization. I know there must be a man for you. Hey, what cooks? This fell out of your pocket this morning. Oh, that. I forgot to put it in the safe at the office. The account's in your name, Nick. Three weeks ago, $1,000. On the first of this month, another $1,000 deposit. Last week, another 1,000. $3,000! I can add. Where did you get this kind of money? Where do you think? Was never on your paycheck. Well, Markel gave it to me. It was cash, a bonus. But if you earned it, why didn't he pay you by check like the rest of your... Oh, for heaven's sakes, Jane, we're married now. It's all community property. What difference does it make? But I want to know! I say don't ask me! You ashamed? Never mind that. What saved Davey's life? Money. What paid for his operation? Money. What brought him right back here in this house? Money. You ashamed? That's unfair, Nick! You know I'd do anything for Davey. Well, so would I! Nick! Nick. What are you doing here? That's what I like, man, friendship. Your car? Yours, man. Imported. Straight from Fresno. Get it out of here. Now, what would Mr. Markel say after he said to bring it here? He wants it should get a face lifting job. All right, park it in the back where nobody'll see it. You're a cruel one, man. I've been driving all day. You park it. Boss wants me to fly to 'Frisco. Business is real cool that way. Mr. Dunn, telephone. It's Mrs. Richards, regarding that Buick sedan. Tell her I'll... All right, I'll talk to her. Thanks. Yes, Mrs. Richards. I told you. Just bring it in, we'll check it over. Just like... Yours? Yeah. Looks new to me. Almost, anyway. Where'd you get it? Auction. Yeah, we pick up a lot of good deals that way. Good thing I was driving by. Uh... look, Davenport... You don't have to sell me. It's my wife. She's the one who wants a Chrysler. That is, if the price is right. 3,200. How much? 3,200. Uh-huh, that's what I thought you said. Yeah... I know, the auction bit. Pick up a lot of good deals that way. Give the customer the break. Well, it's a little over Blue Book, sure. But after all, it has all the extras, you know, and... Well, my wife's fussy, she... She likes the extras. Tell you what, Nick. Yeah? You keep the customers away from that job for the rest of the day and I'll bring my wife down tonight after dinner. You know, between the little from our savings and the credit union, we might just swing this deal. Do that for me, uh? I'll do my best. Can't promise. I'd appreciate it. On the price, too. It's our anniversary. Anxious fellow. Second time he's back. Yeah. Look, why don't you take the rest of the afternoon off, Miss Rogers? And still only 300 days before Christmas? Thanks, Mr. Dunn, goodbye. Goodbye. Mr. Markel, please. Nick Dunn. Mr. Markel? Say, Hutton dropped that Fresno job off here a little while ago. I know, he told me. Only Davenport showed his face again. I get cops for customers who have anniversaries. But he wants the car! Bringing his wife back tonight. You know what'll happen if hegets title. I'm moving the car out. Comes back, I'll tell him it sold, anything. All right. Yeah. We'll split the difference. How about 3,100? We can't, folks. 3,200 is still a bargain. What do you think? That's a lot of money. You get a hunk of junk and you're nickeled and dimed to death. This car is as good as new. Isn't it? New car guarantee. Then you got a deal. Well, look, we, uh, we hate to see anyone go over his head. We hate taking cars back. Not me, friend. I leave that for the other suckers. I have a responsibility to my credit union and... the state. About the down payment. How about 500? Well, we prefer 25%. Let's see, 1/4 of 3,200... That's $800, dear. You're Mr. Dunn? That's right. It's about a car that I, uh... Well, if you'll pardon me just a moment. These folks here were first. Oh, I hate to ask you, folks, but if you don't mind I just have to pick up a car I bought. Of course. Thanks. It's that Chrysler sedan that was over at the Alhambra lot last week. Oh, yes, that's the car these folks here are buying. Well, that's impossible. I already bought it. Look, here's my bill of sale. I'm afraid it's his car, Mr. Davenport. This sometimes happens when there's more than one lot. Salesman gets greedy and fails to notify the other lot. Just wants to make the sale, period. Yeah, maybe so. Sometimes they get too greedy. Say, wait a minute. I've got a beautiful little Buick out there. No thanks. I've had my lesson in cars for one night. You ready? Maybe tomorrow. Well, I'm sorry, folks. Forget it, it's no big deal. Keep your eye out for that other stuff though, hm? Sure. See you. Good night. You took your time, Smiley. Davenport's no tourist. I got here, didn't I? Right, now get that car out of here. You could be a big man, Dunn. Or a real worried one. Relax, kid. You're Markel's boy. I'll see you later, honey. Change your mind about that Buick? Uh-uh, I, um, I want to find out some more about the man who bought the Chrysler. Look, Davenport, what do you want me to do? Get a loyalty oath from every customer that comes in here to buy a car? Don't be cute, Nick. Guy's name's Ward, isn't it? You saw the bill of sale. I guess that's the name that was on it. Smiley Ward. I remember him from when I was still a cop on the beat. Was mixed-up in a lot of things. Cars... dames. Anything that was hot. And I pulled him in once. I don't like him. He smells bad. What'd you come in here for? To give me the autobiography on your life? I thought I was being friendly. Maybe you're a nice guy, Nick. Maybe not. I think you and Ward pulled a fast one with that Chrysler, but I'll find that out, too. We want Markel, and we want him bad. We knock him off in California and he gets knocked off in every other state he operates. And that'll turn him into a federal probe case. And we'd love that. We'd love it just wonderful. You all finished? Uh-uh. We're gonna put our teeth in everybody tied up with Markel. Now, I believe in giving a guy a break. Letting him know in advance what to expect. You don't have to get hurt if you don't want to. The only thing you have to make up your mind about is what side you are on. Good night, Nick. Nice talking to you. That's what I like about Paul at Jack's Place. He's so cooperative. Yeah. You ask him for a simple thing like a telephone number and, before you get it, he gives you the story of his life. But you got the telephone number. Now, aren't you glad I was tired? I don't know what I am tonight. I felt I had to talk with someone. I've got broad shoulders, Nick. I'll even let you cry on one of them. I don't know why I picked you. Who's complaining? Maybe to get some advice about a woman, you... You have to talk to another woman, huh? Sometimes, you don't always talk. Well, how would you react if, if you had a husband that came to you and said he got mixed up in something over his head? Maybe it was too late to pull out. Might be the whole thing'd blow up any minute, him with it. If it was me, I'd say: "I love you. "I'm with you, baby. All the way." Guess I'm a coward. Thanks for the drink, letting me talk. I said I had broad shoulders. You hardly made a dent. Kiss me goodnight... coward. Lieutenant Jefferson. What is this? He's clean. Lieutenant Holmes. We're from Homicide, Mr. Dunn. Nick... If you don't mind, Mrs. Dunn, we'll do the questioning. A little late, huh, Nick? Your wife's been very kind. Kept making coffee for us so we could stay awake to greet you. All right, you've yelled "Surprise, Happy New Year." Now you mind telling me what it's about? Sure, where have you been? What do you mean, "Where have you been?" Just that. I've been out. I'll make some fresh. No games, huh, Nick? It's a lot easier on all of us, and we're tired. Come on, now, where have you been? Been out at a bar drinking; walking. All night? Say around... 10:00 o'clock. This might help. According to Mrs. Davenport, her husband went back to the used car lot to see you alone last night. We've set that time. It was about 9:30. You mind letting me in on your problem? What I have to do with it? You're entitled. Davenport was killed last night. Shot, murdered, he's very dead. We set that time too, about 10:00 o'clock. Now, Nick, we know all about Davenport and what he was doing in L.A. We know the whole bit. Lot of people had a lot of motives for wanting him dead. We just want the one that fits. 10:00 o'clock, where were you? Lieutenant. May I speak to my husband? Alone, please? Go ahead. Nicky. Look at me. Did you kill this man? No. Then I don't care about anything else, Nick. They told you, about the cars? Go back in there. Don't be a hero. Tell them where you were last night, and with whom. Had to be with... somebody. Janie... If it's another woman, not telling them isn't going to make it any easier on me. Or Davey. If you're trying to spare us a hurt, we'll be hurt much more if you're hurt. You see... We love you very much! Janie. There was another woman, but not the way you think... You don't have to explain. But I want to tell you. I don't blame you. I'm not perfect. I kept taking. I didn't always give. Sometimes a wife can't always be a woman. But you have been. No, I haven't. There's been Davey and the worry. You worry so much when you're a mother that sometimes you can't be a wife to your husband. Whatever you did... Janie. I slipped a different way. I worried like a father. Go in and tell them. I'll tell 'em. Kiss me first. I'll be back. Don't you go away. 10:00 o'clock? I was with a woman in her apartment. You want to check my story? Sure do, in person. Fred, you stay here. More coffee, Mrs. Dunn? Miss Winter? Yes? Lt. Jefferson, Homicide. May we come in? You know this guy. Am I supposed to? Nick Dunn. I never saw him before in my life. You're not going to buy that, are you? What are you trying to do, anyway? Mind if we come in, Miss Winter? Do I have a choice? You're in. What do you want? A man's been murdered. Dunn's got a little explaining to do. He says he's got an alibi. You. I've been an alibi before, lieutenant. But never for murder. You know better than that. I met her when she drove onto the lot that day. We even had drinks down at Jack's At The Beach. That right, Miss Winter? I've been to a lot of bars, Lieutenant. Jack's Place isn't one of them. I met a lot of men, had a lot of drinks. Some men think they know me even when they haven't had a drink. Him, I don't know. Lieutenant. Yeah? Would you like for me to describe the bedroom furnishings? Would that mean anything to you? Maybe. Okay, I'll paint you a Rembrandt. Fair enough, Miss Winter? There's the bed. It has a canopy over it. And there's a quilt on top, It's very frilly. Then to your right there's a chair. That's also Early American. Okay, Nick, you told your story. Now let's... Police officer, emergency. He's in real trouble now, Mrs. Dunn. He didn't do it, Lieutenant, he told me. I believe him. I know you do, Mrs. Dunn. But now we've got to find him so that he can prove it. If you have any idea where he's gone, please try and help us. I don't know, I don't know. About this Karen Winters he said he was with. She denies even knowing him. I don't want to make this any more unpleasant than it is, but, did your husband ever mention her or... No. No, he didn't. I don't know if it means anything or not, but... Anything's liable to mean something. Nick did tell me about a woman who came in to buy a car one day, when he worked for Hayman. It was an expensive car. They drove to the beach. He even bought her a drink. They went to Jack's Place. Did he say who she was, what she looked like? "Like a hard top convertible," he said. That's her. Hello, Sam. Hello, Mr. Dunn. What are you doing with the Chrysler, Otto? Oh, hello, Mr. Dunn. Putting in a new front seat, maybe? That's right. What's the matter, too much blood on the other one? I got a color blindness in both eyes. How about Smiley, do you know where he is? Right here! Heard you took off like a hopped-up rabbit, so I've been expecting you. We don't want to keep Mr. Markel waiting. He wants to thank you personally for all you done, Nicky-boy. You saved his life. Might have been very embarrassing if Davenport had been left around here much longer to keep pushing his nose into things. So we had to cut it off. Set me up as the pigeon, huh? But an honest pigeon, sucker. Now we're gonna wrap it up, all nice and pretty. We're even going to do the cops a favor. Save the state the expense of a trial. They're gonna find you on the beach, with a gun in your hand and a hole in your head. You drive. Where to? Jack's Place. Markel might even buy you a drink. And Karen wants to kiss you goodbye. Yeah, real bullets, Nick. You can even ask Davenport. In! Just sit here for a minute, sucker. And wait till they go inside. That's not nice. All right, now back up like nothing's happened. Hey! Where is he? Your friend? He went that way. Fred, stay with them! All right, put 'em in the car. Thanks, Lieutenant. Almost went for a different kind of ride, huh, Nick? Yeah, it started out that way. Yeah, I know. After a talk with your ex-boss and the gal who said she never saw you before in her life. It's about time somebody believed me. Who said nobody didn't? You still got a lot of explaining to do. Put away your rubber hose, Lieutenant. Get out your notebook and pencil.
