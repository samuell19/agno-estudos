Noble Kings, I, King Robert VIII, ruler of the Kingdom of Aspania and lord of the Rivertrine castle, address you, sovereign rulers, with an urgent message. My only daughter, Princess Ellen, is turning 20 in three weeks' time. As her birthday looms, so too does an old threat. As you know, a mighty witch, feared also in your lands has taken revenge on me. Murien. Almost 20 years ago, she took my wife's life and put a curse on my daughter. We've been attempting to free Ellen by breaking the spell for years. However, just tonight, the Chief Alchemist discovered a book in an almost forgotten language, which is the reason why I am writing you now. Noble Kings, this spell can be broken, but I urgently need your help. At dawn, the messengers will set off to deliver the message to you: I promise half the kingdom to the Prince who wins my dear daughter's heart, and thus averts the danger that has threatened us for the last 20 years. Father, I must go. Let's go! Giddy-up! Giddy-up! Mind the words of the alchemists: "Flocking crows above our lands, those are the eyes of wicked Murien." One day old. Oh, the Princess is up. Listen! THE FIRST WITCH HUNTER "The hunter faced the witch. Drawing a longbow, he took aim at her crystal. He shot…" -Good morning, Princess. -What do you mean by Princess? Why don't you say: "Your Highness"? Happy birthday, Your Highness! Oh, I forgot, this is a new guard, Frank. A new recruit in our court corps. I am honoured, Your Highness. I didn't know we were cutting the staff short. His predecessor has fled the castle, you know why… Gentlemen, I'd love to spend at least my birthday on my own. It's bad enough I cannot leave the castle today, I have a nanny already. Wait! I am sorry, Prin… Your Highness. By order of the king! We have to guard you the whole day. -Our "bow lady". -Stupid curse! You're grown-up today. That's the third one today already. -Is that for my birthday party? -Yes. Just a few details and we are ready. Have some, if you like. How would I look if I ate everything I like? What use is all the celebration? The curse is coming anyway. It's not funny at all. The feast is also for your suitors. Ah! The suitors! Or rather the last and desperate attempt to break the curse? A dove brought a message. Prince John is on his way. Flour. We know each other already. And he doesn't like me anyway. -I think he thinks I am arrogant. -Arrogant? How on earth could he think such a thing? Weird, isn't it? He told me I was lovely and charming, and I said: That's pretty given, isn't it? He has no sense of humour. Oh. That reminds me I need some apples for a pie. -Alice? -Yes? No, wait! That's the last one you have here. Who else would do the shopping? Me! You have to stay inside the castle, my dear. Technically, the market is inside the castle. No! The list is here, as every day, isn't it? You are going nowhere! Don't you know what day it is? You Highness! Wait! Stop it there! And who else would do the shopping? Your Highness. Taste our… PASTRY BAKER …honey cake! Who is she going to make mad this time? -Happy birthday, Your Highness. -Come and taste this. Oh, Princess! Happy birthday, Your Highness. Only four groschen to win many times more. Just solve my riddle, that's it. Very well, young man, come! And how about you? -Don't dare to lose! -I won't! Young man, you look smart. My riddles are easy! Let's begin. Listen carefully. No one has seen it, yet it's often all around us. Loved by some, and hated by others. See you. When you say its name, it disappears. -Good morning, Your Highness. -Good morning. What's good about it? I have not smiled yet. I will have… That makes 20 groschen. And one for you, young lady. Thank you. Princess? Can I ask you something? -Sure. -Aren't you afraid of the evening? Let's go. I am sorry, gentlemen, but all your groschen are now mine. Please. -Great! And what now? -We will try it again. Are you crazy? We have no more money. You should have solved the first riddle. It was so easy! Silence! -All right. -My riddles are easy! The Court's Alchemist, Archibald. Your Majesty? There have been rumours about a ghostly woman with a flock of crows in the neighbouring kingdoms. Is that what we feared, my dear friend? Is she really back? -Flocking crows above our lands… -Archibald! I don't need poetry. What I need is hope. I know. Everything is under control. We have doubled the guards. The Witch Hunters are awaiting audience and tonight, I will accompany you to the feast. What about the princes? How many are expected? We are expecting only Prince John. Only Prince John? Here you are! Come on! Why all this? Wait… where are the apples for the pie? Martha must have forgotten to put them in. Well, thank you very much. Yeah! Scurry, scurry! What about Prince John? He is from a good family and he is so kind. Will you stop it already! Kind?! I didn't say that much. Prince John of Calderon. -Welcome, dear Prince. -Your Majesty. -How is your father? -He is alright. Yet he would be happier if I'd stayed home. I hope he is not worried about you. I hear you have won many a fencing tournament. There is still time to leave. Long time ago, I made a promise to the Princess. And I will keep that promise. You are a man of your word. I appreciate it. There's no time to spare, so let's get to the point. Yeah. After many years of searching, we have finally found an ancient text - with a clue as to how to break the spell. "Even the most powerful curse can be broken by such love that is stronger than the fear of one's death." Love. So pure and brave… That it doesn't fear death. I see. So what are you asking me to do? If I remember well, you were quite close to each other as children. Try to arouse her love. A kiss should do the trick. -Yes? -The Witch Hunters. Your Majesty. Majesty. In case of my failure? I thought you'd fled the kingdom as well. -And you are just late. -Somebody has to stay here with you. -So you have accepted the curse? -Again?! Nobody even knows whether the witch cursed me or not. -The only two people claiming it… -…are my father and Archibald. Elbow. No, still too low. Good. -So it wasn't the elbow. -You don't believe it yourself. How else would they come up with the spell? "When the sun finally sets behind the third mountain… …darkness will devour the castle." Great! Why do you keep bringing this up? -It used to bother you. -Bother me? Don't close your eye, that's useless. Aim with both eyes. Then you do believe something is going to happen tonight. Sure. I am going to get a kiss. Maybe it's you who should open both eyes. And not just rely on other people. It's too late for that. What is meant to happen will happen. Good afternoon, Your Highness. -What can I do for you? -I'd like to talk to the Princess. I am sorry to disappoint you, but the Princess is trying on her evening dress, she is too scantily dressed. Did it shrink or what?! You shall meet her at the feast tonight. I will hand it to her. It went really well. -He is sending you a rose. -How sweet. The vase is by the window. You won't like this, but he was dressed in his family colours. Are you joking? I wear red all the time! Please rise. Her Highness, Ellen of Aspanina. I am honoured, my lady. A kiss for the prince! Amelia! Silence, please! King Robert VIII. I would like to propose a toast to my only daughter, to her twentieth birthday. She has suffered all these years worried that her life is cursed by the spell of the wicked witch. Almost half of the kingdom has fled over those years, so I would like to thank all of you who are staying with us even on this inglorious evening. Let's raise our glasses… to our princess and her coming of age. And as Prince John is at the table, too, let's toast to the rediscovered friendship and cooperation of our kingdoms… I condemn your daughter to live in fear. Upon the day of her twentieth birthday, as the last ray of light sets behind the third mountain, darkness will devour the castle. It's the Black Storm. You have to kiss her now! Be quick! It looks like I have not thought it through… A white one? Oh, the Princess is up. "The hunter faced the witch. Drawing a longbow, he took aim at her crystal. He shot…" Good morning, Princess. I told you yesterday, it's "Your Highness"! I was not here yesterday. Happy birthday, Your Highness! A birthday is only once a year, isn't it? Are you all right, Princess? Oh, I forgot, this is our new guard, Frank. -A new recruit in our… -…court corps. Oh, our "bow lady". Today you're a grown-up. -Stupid curse! -That's the third one today already. -Is that for my birthday party? -Yes. Just a few details and we are ready. Something wrong? I have to go. Where? To the market. Wait! Your Highness. Only four groschen to win many times more. -Just solve my riddle, that's it. -This is the best possible quality. We don't have enough money to buy shoes for all our children. -I have to give it a go. -Sophie needs them the most. The boys can wait one more winter. Don't you dare lose! I won't! Come on. You know I'm good at riddles. Great, young man. Come! What about you? You look smart. Good morning, Your Highness! My riddles are easy! Like for children! No one has ever seen it, yet it's often all around us. Loved by some, hated by others. -Princess? -Listen carefully! No one has ever seen it, yet it's often all around us. Loved by some, and hated by others. When you say its name… Puff! It disappears. What is it? Here you are. -Where are the apples for the pie? -They… didn't have them. What about Prince John? He doesn't like me anyway. -And no… -…he's not kind! He is sending you a rose. The vase is by the window. Why are you putting on the red dress? Didn't you want to wear something else? And the Prince was wearing what? Red… the rose is red. Silence, please. King Robert VIII. I would like to propose a toast to my only daughter. White? So white it is! Chenda! Are you all right? This is too much! "Drawing a longbow he took aim at her crystal." He shot. -Happy birthday, Princess! -Your Highness! -Our… -Our "bow lady". Grown-up today! -I don't give a damn… -Again! Where are you going? Run! The Black Storm is coming! The Black Storm? What's wrong? Do you know how I knew you were about to say "bow lady"? -I keep saying that all the time. -No, that's not it! Alright. So how did you know? I am living today over and over again. I am twenty again, the third time at least! Three times twenty? Great. Then we need more candles for your cake. I don't mean the whole twenty years. It's only this day, today. Ellen, I can see that. You are afraid of tonight. That's natural, my dear. You've been waiting twenty years to find out whether the curse -would come true and today… -Can you listen to what I say? Alright. I am listening. -Sure, shopping! -Shopping? Don't you need the shopping? How else would I know? Here is the shopping list. Two cucumbers, ten plums, four parsley roots… Stop! What kind of nonsense is this? -You forgot apples. -Damn! The apples! I put the list there every day so that I won't forget anything. And the cooks or maids do the shopping for me. But today you sent me! You?! You must stay inside the castle. Ellen. What is going on in here? Are you joking? I know you are afraid of tonight, but you can't be serious. Does the curse say anything about the repetition of this day? No. What are you giving up? Today. Why can't it be tomorrow? At least I would not be stuck inside the castle. With this attitude, you would be unhappy at any given time. At least I could ride a horse over the plains, by the river… Ellen. You're so focused on where you'd rather be… That you even forget how to make the most of today. Today? Are you serious? Remember when you were a child? You'd find something nice every single day. Live a little! Live a little… You are honoured, I know. But you can't wait for the kiss in the first place, right? What is this behaviour about? Hello everybody! Before my dear father urges Prince John to kiss me, which actually turns out to be sweet but useless, and before our kingdom turns to dust, my father would like to toast to my birthday. Silence, please. King Robert VIII. I would like to toast to my only daughter, to her twentieth birthday. Stop it! She has suffered all these years worried that her life is cursed by the spell of the wicked witch. -So I would like to thank you all… -In a moment… …for staying with us even on this inglorious evening. Let's raise our glasses to our princess and her coming of age. Here we go again. She's flown away! Catch the mouse. The end. Princess! Wait! You wanted to see me? HOW TO KILL TIME -Don't you worry about getting fat? -I won't get fat in one day. Come! Yeah. Not bad! So what do we have here? Sure, a lady from the right. Let's blow it up… and blow it out. Princess, you mustn't leave the castle! Then you do believe something is going to happen tonight. Yes, I'll get a kiss. Dear folks, solve my riddle and you can win. No one has seen it, yet it's often all around us… -Silence! -Eh… Yes, taste our honey cake! Bravo! Bravo! Have you ever thought about why certain things happen to you? There is no sense in anything I do. Amelia, tell me, what good are all those adventures if I can't share them? You can share them with me, can't you? Why? You forget all about them by the morning. I keep living this day over and over again. -Ellen. -Yes, I mean it. And no, I am not afraid of today. I can prove it to you. Are you wondering how? There're six cloves of garlic in your hand, you have three groschen in your wallet and you need some apples for the pie. Very well, you have my attention. So the groschen made you believe me? So where do I begin? If I understand correctly… Prince John is coming today, isn't he? That should help to break the curse. Only it won't. Do you know how many times I've got that sweet and useless kiss? Got a kiss! But I am talking about love! -But Archibald said… -Archibald? Silly old buffer! He knows nothing about love. So what then? So… one more time. To break the curse… all you need is love. Your Highness, somebody has come to see you. It's Her Highness, Princess Ellen. Please, let her in. -My lady. -My lord. Even though our last meeting was a bit of a failure, would you kindly accept my invitation to an afternoon archery session and a glass of our Aspanian wine? I am not good at archery, I prefer sword-fighting, unfortunately. But I'd be happy to spend some time with you anyway. -My lady. -My lord. Even though our last meeting was a bit of a failure, would you kindly accept my invitation for afternoon horse riding and a glass of our Aspanian wine? The truth is, dear Princess, I usually don't drink alcohol. But how about tea? With a drop of milk and a pinch of cinnamon? …and a cup of tea from faraway Olleria, with a drop of milk and a pinch of cinnamon? -Sounds like my cup of tea. -What a coincidence, isn't it? I think my father would love to meet you before the ride. My lady, these horses - Ellen. You used to call me Ellen when we were kids. And yes, they come from the Land of Bersian Riders. Your Highness. Wait, it's the Princess! Ellen, wait! I thought your horse was faster, Prince. I don't want to embarrass you, my lady. Let's see it then! You don't need to hide it away from me. Force of habit. Yes, it's how I remember it. It is the Rune of Time. Yes. From the First Runic Script. I know, from the Isle of Timräel. Tirnäel, it's Tirnäel. There we go, you're correcting me again. Do you remember? No! No! No! Are you crazy? It's going to take ages to comb it out! You should have stayed at home! Well, let's do it again. Ellen, wait! Let's see it then. Yes, it's how I remember it. It is the Rune of… …Time. It comes from the First Runic Script. Yeah. Do you remember? You! Ouch! Oh, I am sorry, John. Let me see. -What is it? -Nothing. Come on. My mother used to take care of me in this manner. I see. She doesn't do that anymore? No, she died eleven years ago. I thought you knew. -I'm sorry. -It's fine. It's been a long time. I've been meaning to tell you something nobody else knows. Father, could I sit next to Prince John? Of course. Why the red dress again? Don't you have anything else to wear? To match up with Prince John, naturally. What? You still don't love me? -Another alchemy lesson? -Preparation for the final exams. -Let's go shooting. -Wait. Maybe tomorrow. Happy birthday, my dear. I know, I know. Birthday. I wonder how old you are, too bad you insist on not celebrating your birthday anymore, right? How can I help you, Ellen? You have not thought it through, Archibald. What a silly idea, to invite a prince to kiss me! Mistaking a single kiss for true love! I can tell you right now that it won't work. How do I know it? Because today keeps coming back over and over again! I can prove it. Think about a number. You don't need to prove it. I've been expecting something like that. Do you remember my protective spell? Sure. Tell me then. "I invoke the spirits of the First Runic Script… …to protect your soul - -may time be… -…your servant, not your master." I didn't mean it literally back then, but I've been thinking about it and expecting you might turn up and tell me something like that. Let me see your hand. How many days has it been? I am not sure. But I've already had about thirty birthday parties. There's no time to lose. You must find your true love or kill Murien, the creator of the spell. That was the Witch Hunters' job. Yesterday morning, she took over our former frontier castle. Have you seen the flock of crows? -Flocking crows above our lands… -Oh, please. See for yourself… but be careful. We've already read it twice. It's time we gave it back to Archibald. -Just the crystal, please. -One. Two. "The crystal fell apart and the wicked witch lost all her power. All's well that ends well." Three. Four. -Is it alright? -There's a scratch here, you see? -Won't the guards be looking for you? -Sure they will. -Princess? -Where is she? You and your book! Now we're in a pickle! -Learn to read yourself! -Princess? -Princess! -Hurry up! -Sure. -Princess? Your Highness, what are you doing here? -I'd like to visit the castle. -Nobody can visit the castle. We are the Witch Hunters. It's our job. Go ahead then, gentlemen. Open the gate! -That was the job of… -…the Witch Hunters. They didn't even manage to cross the threshold of the gate. Ellen, what exactly is going to happen tonight? As soon as the sun sets behind the mountains, the Black Storm comes. The Black Storm? Can Murien invoke it? What exactly did she want back then? Your soul. In order to protect the kingdom, from the Black Storm. Which now seems to be her own piece of work anyway. My soul? Why wouldn't she just take it? There are certain rules in magic, Ellen. Your soul could have given her immortality only if offered voluntarily and exactly on the seventh day after your birth. Now I understand, she had planned everything. Murien would save the kingdom, if your father granted her one wish. Whatever it might be. And standing in the tallest tower while watching the coming storm, King Robert had no choice. The Black Storm was gone, and so was Murien. Only to come back one year later to ask for your soul. The king naturally refused and the rest is history. Murien had cursed you that day, but I seared an ancient rune onto your hand and uttered a spell to protect you. That's why the day keeps coming back over and over again after the Black Storm hits. The Rune of Time protects you. They didn't even manage to cross the threshold of the gate? The frontier castle must be locked with a very powerful spell. The Locksmith's Scroll. It's only a legend… but it might actually exist. If so, it'll be… in the Resurrected Mountains. You must look for it there, you see? -Me? In the Resurrected Mountains? -That's right. -We are not allowed to go there. -That does not bother you, does it? -Why should I… -Once you enter the Resurrected Mountains according to the legend, you have to find the Mouth of Truth, carved into the rock, go through the Mists of Whisper, get to the Ear of Secrets and behold the Eyes of Light. "Let the Mouth speak, so that the Ear would listen. Let the Mouth speak, so that the Light would shine. Do so for the riddle to be heard." Ellen, time is your servant now. Use it wisely. Are you coming along? You would never make it on time with me. You must ask somebody else. That's why the same day keeps coming back to me. Will you get the horses ready? Three of them? Even for the Prince? So you've lived through today before? I'm supposed to believe that, Ellen? Yes. I am going to tell you something you have not mentioned to a living soul. Princess, you must not leave the castle! Raise the alarm! The path ends here. We have to go on foot. -There you go. -Thanks. It should be on the other side. The Mouth of Truth. Great. How do we get there? Feel like swimming? The answer is right here. But it's incomplete. There is another one over there. What does it say? It is the First Runic Script. The translation could be tricky. "If you know the path, say it to the lake… and let yourself be guided." We know the path. So say it. No, not "say". "Write". Write it! If you know the path, write it down. "If you know the path", meaning if you know the rune for the word "path". And what now? Amelia, you've become a true alchemist. Well, not yet. According to Archibald, there is one more exam to pass. But I have no idea what to expect. What was the clue Archibald gave you? How was it? "Let the Mouth speak, so that the Ear would listen. Let the Mouth speak, so that the Light would shine. Do so for the riddle to be heard." What are you asking for, Ellen? The Locksmith's Scroll. "Walk 100 steps through the Mists of Whisper, until you reach another pool. There you'll find the Ear of Secrets. Then you should disclose the truth others want to hear, yet would not ask because of their fear." -You are lost, it's pointless even to try. -Rubbish, there is nothing. …96, 97… Watch out! Ellen! Cling onto the root! "Disclose the truth others want to hear, yet would not ask because of their fear." Hidden truth. A secret. Ellen, tell the ear a secret of yours. I'm living this day over and over again. Well, we know this already. May I? Hey, it's a secret, so don't listen. -Done? -No! Well, I kind of hoped that the King would offer me Ellen's hand in marriage for my help. -Done? -Yes. Done what? It's done, we need help. I condemn your daughter to live in fear. Upon the day of her twentieth birthday, as the last ray of light sets behind the third mountain, darkness will devour the castle. Ware, beware the dying light Shelter well from the night Don't despair for the curse you will break On silent wings night awakes The horse will run beyond the shore The shadowed sun veiled in fear Perhaps the father will break through before The blackened wings come too near Ever near Run, so run! Bend the hourglass to your will The Sands of Time frozen still Perhaps you are the one Perhaps you're the only one To strike the beast from the sky The horse will run beyond the shore The shadowed sun veiled in fear Perhaps the father will break through before The blackened wings come too near Come too near "Disclose the truth others want to hear, yet would not ask because of their fear." "…yet would not ask because of their fear." -Any ideas? -No, I am sorry. I could think about it till tomorrow, but it wouldn't help you much. An interesting riddle, at any rate. Riddle, riddle… …92, 93, 94, -95, 96, 97, 98. -…You are lost, it's pointless to try. What? -What does it want to hear? -That depends on you. On us? "Disclose the truth others want to hear, yet they would not ask because of their fear." You must ask me something you want to know. But be honest! Come on, the whole kingdom is at stake. You aren't scared of me, are you? -Come on now, John of Calderon. -I know! Why did you tell my parents, I'd been secretly attending Archibald's lessons of alchemy? You know about it? Of course I do. I was jealous. Correct! Amelia, back then I had to learn how to curtsy and wear heels… My best friend was allowed to attend Archibald's lessons and learn magic. And all I could do was archery. Nothing else. And I had to fight for it. I am sorry. John? There you go. Come on… You stopped inviting me to your birthday parties when you turned 12. Why? No! Did I really do that? I thought you were not interested. It was not the question you are afraid to ask, was it? You mean this little enchantress has more courage than the future king? Is your kingdom full of such "heroes" like you? Is your father, the king, as fearless as you are? That's enough! I won't listen to some idle talk. You have to have courage to come to this accursed kingdom on the day of its doom simply to ask - -To ask what? -It doesn't matter! To ask what?! Jesus, you wuss! -You cursed goose! -To ask what?! To ask you if you love me. Oh, how sweet. No, I don't. You do? Do I? Then… Then I don't know. Correct! Ellen, once the shadow falls upon the opposite bank, swim towards the Eyes of Light. There you shall find the Scroll. The Scroll that opens every door. You didn't tell me you didn't know. -Hurry up! -Quickly! Ellen! Look, our brilliant Witch Hunters. We are late. Opening this door unlocks the magic. No secret is to be concealed. No anger is to be left behind. Well, that's done then. The Locksmith's Scroll. How inventive of you, Ellen. How can I help you? You want to help me? Lift the curse, walk away and leave our kingdom alone. Don't tell me you bothered to get the Locksmith's Scroll just to say this. -The curse is irreversible. -Only if you stay alive. For a little while I thought you were smarter than your father. People to beasts. Yeah! Is that all? Maybe you've muddled it up? Time to be human. Time to be timeless. Fossilisation. Let's begin. Like I said, she's standing with her back to us. We have to shoot before she faces us. John, you will have time to hide behind the column on your left and get closer to her. Beware of the blue light! "Drawing a longbow, he took aim at her crystal…" Do you have some more magic up your sleeve, Amelia? I am not a witch. I'm an alchemist. We use magical objects to create magic. Not spells as such. It belongs to Archibald. Now! "Drawing a longbow, he took aim at her crystal. He shot…" Don't wait with the daggers, we must attack her as soon as she is close enough. Crawl as in "crawl"! Understand? "The hunter faced the witch. Drawing a longbow, he took aim at her crystal. He shot. The moment the arrowhead shattered the crystal, the very source of power for all witches, an inhuman scream emanated from the throat of the wicked woman." Good morning, Princess! We are sorry, we will return the book. It's the rose! We have to destroy the rose! Wait, Princess! I'll shoot at Murien and you'll destroy the rose. Ellen! What a true hero, so brave, and yet so foolish. You really think you can stand up against me? So be it. Why are you doing this, John? For my promise and love! She's just a silly little girl! She doesn't love you a bit! She is not able to love, for her soul is cursed! Do you think you had killed all the love in her? No spell could possibly kill all the love in one's heart. Moreover, I discovered her love years ago. That's when I fell in love with her. With her true self. For which I would risk my own life… Great rammer! John! You can't beat me. You are nothing but a little girl. Whatever you may think, Murien, but I'll be back. I'll be always back. Until the moment you fall. You'll be back you say? His magic is the magic of my sight. I invoke the spirits of the First Runic Script to protect your soul: may time be your servant, not your master. The Rune of Time. If I remove it from you now, do you think you'll wake up again tomorrow? Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! Protective spell, be gone! We are riding for a fall. I am exhausted. -Hurry up! We are almost there. -Come on! Scurry, scurry! I hate scurrying! It was your idea to steal from the library. -Smarten up! -That's right. "Drawing a longbow, he took aim at her crystal. He shot…" -Good morning, Princess. -Good morning, Martin. -Happy birthday! -Thank you. -Happy birthday! -Thank you, Frank. -You know my name? -I do! -Where are you going, Princess? -Shopping. Come with me! PASTRY BAKER Happy birthday, Your Highness! Thank you, Anet. How are little Anna and Lucas? You do remember them? They are fine, thank you! Yeah. Martin, could you? Oh, the Princess. Happy birthday, Your Highness. Thank you, Marika. -Good morning, Princess. -Good morning. I have a brand new yew bow here. The string is made from tendon, a razor-sharp arrowhead, pheasant feather fletches… Say "silence". Good morning, Martha. Good morning, Your Highness. -What is it? -Your shopping list. -And a rose. -You've been to the market? How did you know what I need? You can't face her again, Ellen. Apparently, we've tried everything, and this time you won't wake up again. You can't change my mind. We don't have time to try anything else. But I understand if you won't come with me today. Amelia, I need you to tell Archibald what is going to happen. I will tell our people. The time has come. Take it, if you want. There is the third question for these three brave young gentlemen. Anybody else wants to join us? No? Pity. -Prince? -Step back! -Prince? -Step back! Listen, everybody! Your Highness! The curse is true. At dusk, the Black Storm will come. Run away while there's still time! Ask me whether I love you. What? That is the question you fear. Come on. Do you love me? I don't know. -That's weird. -What? It usually works. I do. Correct! Well, I guess I should leave now. Gentlemen! I know you won't believe me, but I'd like to kindly ask you to get out of our way. I know what's going to happen and I also know this is what we need to get inside. The Locksmith's Scroll. -Your Highness, you don't… -Gentlemen, we're not actually asking. Alright, as Your Highness wishes. Amelia. Could I have a word with the Prince, please? Sure. Gentlemen, how about checking out this interesting rock over here? -Come with me. -Let's go. I still don't understand one thing. Our last meeting was a failure. I didn't make a good impression at all. -How come you love me despite all that? -Do I? Yes, John. You do. Yes, I do. I know what you are like, Ellen. Sure, you are sarcastic and sometimes really obnoxious. But this is not who you really are. Our last meeting was not just the moment of your pride, when you told me how beautiful you were by stealing my own words. I remember something completely different from that day. It was right after my mother died. It was you who kept the little boy inside me alive. When all I could see was death, you showed me how to enjoy life. This is how I remember you. And I don't care what the rest of the kingdom may think of you. Why didn't you visit me after that? After my mother's death, my father became withdrawn and I couldn't find the courage to talk to you again. You wuss. Judging by your facial expression, I haven't told you this before, even after all those days. No, you haven't. So let's save the world, shall we? It may be too late for that. Enchantress, let's go! And take them with you! Again? -What is she talking about? -Take me, Murien! I am giving you my royal soul, voluntarily. You mustn't do that! I am sure you know that royal blood must be offered on the seventh day after birth. It's over! What a waste. I've been sort of expecting all of you lot. -Frank! -Martin! Frank, hold me! -Frank, hold me! -Martin! Frank! Martin! Damn. The crystal! I won't be taken by surprise now! Amelia, don't! Surprise! You've never been a match for me. There's a first time for everything. Ellen! You think you're smart. You think you can outwit me, but you know nothing. Your father betrayed me and broke his promise, but it was me who had created the Black Storm in order to get your soul! -Hide behind me, Ellen. -John. No! Ellen, what have you done? You sacrificed yourself for him… For love?! The kingdom is doomed anyway! No, it's you who's doomed. Forever! Where have you been?! -What's happened? -Murien has fallen! I hope I'll be able to tell you more about it tomorrow. It's the Black Storm, Archibald. -I thought we made it in time. -So did I. A farewell kiss? Honourable Fellowship of the Alchemists, the curse laid upon Aspania has been broken. Here you will find a detailed account of my protective spell using the Rune of Time. First and foremost, it must be said that the end of the story about the Princess lost in time will be referred to by the bards as a new beginning. The birth of a new era bringing restoration of long lasting friendships, old values, and love. Love that brings hope for a happy future to many hearts, including mine. Truthfully yours, Archibald, Chief Alchemist of the Kingdom of Aspania. Ware, beware the dying light Shelter well from the night Don't despair for the curse you will break On silent wings night awakes The horse will run beyond the shore The shadowed sun veiled in fear Perhaps the father will break through before The blackened wings come too near Ever near Run, so run! Bend the hourglass to your will The Sands of Time frozen still Perhaps you are the one Perhaps you are the only one To strike the beast from the sky The horse will run beyond the shore The shadowed sun veiled in fear Perhaps the father will break through before The blackened wings come too near Come too near
