That's what I told them, too But look at this... What is it? It's his last will Last will? Yes, you're holding it. And here are his ashes Ashes or not, I've never heard about him How can he be buried in our house? We must be clear about it Who would tell us what we should do? It's a difficult situation, we can't just allow it Anyway, you can stay here for now Forget about the ashes for a moment You must eat something first That day, right after midnight, the landlord gave permission to chant some blessings After that Tokitos' clock seemed to strike 4 You still want to go look at that hole?

Su-e, what's wrong? Don't cry! What is it? I've come to sell a clock A clock? We had one at home, a long time ago It's really inconvenient to have just one clock for the whole village If there is a clock, everybody can make the sun go up and down Look! The sun is setting behind the mountains It's really going down! What are you doing, Tsubana? It's so late! I am burying my father's ashes I am doing as he asked me "Take out my ashes... "and mix them with the ground. "There can be a garden there." This is Tokitos' family grave Besides Daisaku's ashes nothing else should be put in there Father, I'll bury you here You can rest in peace Dai... Dai... Dai... Are you alright? Are you alright? It's alright Incredible! The little boy has grown up, mommy! No, not like this I am sorry - It's really hot - Nothing special It can warm your whole body Like the feeling of sunrise Tell me Like sunrise?

Impossible! How could it be? If it's really a clock, it can be one of those which disappeared earlier If it is, we must tell everyone right now Can it really be a clock? It really is No mistake about it It can be used to tell time Oh... Reverend Can I ask you? How many clocks do you think there must be in a village? I am not sure I am not an astronomer, you know But if there are two evenings in one day, it may become very annoying It's not necessarily bad For me... for me, it's very annoying Let's all go to the place where you saw the clock - Everybody come with me - I'll go too Wait Reverend, I haven't finished your haircut yet Hurry up, Sutekichi! Sutekichi! It's hard to make a move Even if it is dead, I'll still have the rest If it is to disappear, I won't be able to help it Like this? Right here? Hey! We've come for your clock? Why? It's really confusing to have two clocks in the village That's just how it is This clock breaks the rules We can't tell the real time because of it - Let go... Let go... - No! We need this clock for our household planning - Let go - Don't snatch me Come on over here Let go Run away now Hurry up Oh my God Su-e Daisaku Daisaku HUSBAND Darling? Did you hear me, darling?
