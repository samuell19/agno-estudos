ASSAULT AND BATTERY "This is Knut Nilsen, 31 years old. Lives in Stockholm. Sometimes works at the docks. Played by Knut Pettersen. " "This is Knut's friend Björn, 24 years old. Interrupted college studies. Plays political theater. " "Sometimes participates in political rallies. Played by Björn Granath. " "This is Berit, 21 years old. Works at a dry cleaning shop. Lives with her mother. Played by Berit Persson. " "The movie starts with the day Björn for the first time meets Berit. " "Berit was on her way to work and Björn talked her in to spending the day with him. " "Now they are on their way to Björn's condemned flat on Birger Jarlsgatan. " - What did you say you do? - I'm a socialist. - Mhm. I work at a dry cleaning shop. - Work at a dry cleaning shop? - Yeah. - What do you do if you are a socialist? - The whole system stinks. All of it! - What system? - It has to change. - Won't you come up here for a while? - What am I gonna do up there? It's warmer up here. - Are you gonna seduce me then? - No, you're gonna seduce me. - I'm gonna seduce you? - Yeah. Well, only if you want to. I'm not gonna force you. I've never met a socialist before. Not like this anyway. - They're alright. - They are? Are they able? - Of course they are. - I thought all they did was... - Well, that's a question of freedom. - Yeah? - How do you mean? - Well, I don't care, see? I don't give a damn about capitalism. I've got nine hundred kronor in the bank. Does that make me a capitalist? - Not if you share it with me. - You're making fun of me. You were gonna explain. - Nine hundred? You could do a lot with that. - Yeah, but does it make me a capitalist? - No, you're a wage earner. You're being used. - I'm being used? Used? "... Winston Churchill standing in front of you, saying; 'These are the last traces of nazism- - and we shall fight them until they are banned out of Europe. "' "Then he says:'This is not the beginning, this is not the end. But maybe it's the beginning of the end. "' "Hey, look at these people- - what a crime against humanity, if you consider it. Here they walk as trained robots. Where? Where? Look at all those coats. This is systematic indoctrination of humans. Why can't we make jackets, shoes, hats, cars that last another five or ten years? They make jackets today to be thrown out tomorrow, just so a gang of capitalists can earn their money. It's systematic destruction of humans. What a tragedy. Imagine the potential these people possess- - if they could only break free from the exploitations of this economic mechanism. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh? Look at them, how neatly they walk. Well raised, decent people. Every sunday the sit at home, eating cake- - watching their tv. Every tuesday they go out and get pounded on the head with things they can buy. Look at all the ads: Buy this, buy that! It's all systematic exploitation- - a crime!They're criminals, for God's sake!This is a rogue society. The "criminals" are the ones protesting the crimes. Therefore the"criminals" are the honest, and the"honest" are the criminals. They're supposed to be robots, for a God damn upper class to profit on! Ever thought about that? Ever thought about that? "Man's written history is five thousand years old. " "More has happened in the last fifty years, than all the ones before that. "Humanity is half a million years old. " "More has happened in these last fifty years. What will happen in the next two hundred?" "Perhaps Man is mutating. " "Maybe she will evolve into something completely new, a whole new species. " "The new species will be one without aggression. " "What's preventing this social evolution?" "It's the whole social structure we live within. " "The upper class oppressing the lower classes, pushing them down into illiteracy- - pushing them down into need, pushing them down into hunger- - throwing away the potential, the human intelligence, that could have been used to do good. " "The lid!The damn lid that prevents all evolution. " "If this lid would only disappear, Man could- - live to see a technical and social explosion. " "If only the lid would disappear... " - ... and that's the Gröna Lund amusement park, the new... - Hey! Are you aware of the fact that you are a lid? Have you ever considered the human, social and economic emancipation process? No, I can't really say that I have. We humans have evolved over periods of time, right? Once we were apes. Then we found the stick, became half-humans and then we became humans. - Is this something you've made up? - This process doesn't end, does it? We haven't reached the end of human evolution, have we? - Can I finish! - But, what have I got to do with this? I'm only... I'm only asking you if you have thought about this. That the economic evolution frees the human resources- - which allows Man to take another step in her evolution. - But you are the lid. The upper class... - How the hell... I'm only trying to reason with you- - the lid that prevents the human, social and economic emancipation process. Now, you're really narrow-minded about this. Try to see it in another way... - Very interesting! - Hey... Often when I say that two plus two is four, and the shoe doesn't fit- - someone says; "But that's really narrow - minded!" "It's more complicated than that!" The point being that you as a person- - don't have any interest in seeing yourself as a lid!Why the hell would you? You are the lid, resulting in people hungering to death, God damn it! I've got this damn car because... Can I finish? I've got this car to help make me do a better job, alright! I work between sixteen and eighteen hours a day- - and this is what I treat myself to. - Excuse me... Are you aware of the fact that society's material and economic resources- - amount to a certain quantity? - Well, yes. Are you aware of the fact that the re-destribution of these resources is such- - that one guy can ride around in a Jaguar! Do you know who's produced this Jaguar? Do you know the producing forces of society- - that make it at all possible for you to drive a Jaguar? Have you ever thought about that? The ones that keep this society moving, that produce the things you're buying- - like your damn coat and your damn Jaguar are the result of. The re-distribution of this result is such, that you're able to drive a Jaguar worth fifty thousand! Who's produced that Jaguar, huh? The workers. It's MYGod damn Jaguar you're driving! It's MYGod damn Jaguar you're riding around in! - You can go to hell! - For one thing... - Do you hear me? Yo can go to hell! - For one thing... - ... second, you're riding in my car. - You can go to hell... Yes, this interrogation concerns the charges brought against you today. According to Mr. Hedqvist, you were a bit rowdy and violent earlier. Do you want to tell me what happened- - so I can get a better view of what happened? Well, I was walking down Fjällgatan, and met this guy, to whom I tried to explain- - the complexity of the society we live in today. - Yes? - ... and how Man could evolve- - in the future, and I gave some interesting historical views. And he wouldn't listen to me. He blew me off. Yes? And maybe he shouldn't have... So he got into his car and wanted to leave- - well, in MYcar as it turns out... - Mhm. - So I was pissed off... - Sorry, did you say YOUR car? - Sure. - Really? Why? You got the impression that it was your car? - Is it your car? - Yes, in a way, because- - well, it's certainly not his. - It's a production result of my social class. - And you have the registration papers? - No, but that's not... - You have the tax receipt? I can prove that car is an act of robbery. I might as well accuse him, his crime is much worse than mine. That is a different story. Let's concentrate on this one, right? So that's that. Do you admit or deny this incident? I admit that I punched him for riding around in my car. The reason I punched him is that he was riding around in my car. "Mr. Nilsen admits to- - being guilty of assault and battery. " That's that. I'd love to... Yes, so did I... Yeah, I'd love to... What are we gonna do, then? You think so?... Really?... What? Yes... What?... You'll come pick me up at six?... Ok, bye! - Dear child. Calmly now,who is God? - That's the guy up in heaven. That is correct. Now, I shall ask you;Who is the Holy Spirit? - Well, that's the guy who's with him. - That's right. In popular speech you can say that the Holy Spirit is God's 'pal'. - Then I will also ask... - Can you laugh during confirmation? Hush! I'll carry on now. I'll say this: "You have now proved your knowledge of these teachings. " "Which our lord Jesus Christ in his holy word has brought to our attention- - and in his congregation has been proclaimed and professed. " "Do you believe in our lord God, heaven's and earth's creator?" - I do. - "I do", that is written here, yes. - "Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son... " - I do. - "Do you believe in the Holy Spirit and the holy... " - I do. - "Do you, through God's mercy, wish to prove this... " - I do. - "Do you therefore, with the help of God under watchfulness of prayer, wish to apply the words of God... " I do, yes. You are now confirmed, taken up in society as a good citizen- - in this society, sharing the christian heritage, and so on. - But you can quit church if you wish. - You can? Yes, you can. - Knut Nilsen? - Yes. I have been trying to reach you, regarding the presentence investigation. - Is it ok ifwe do it now? - Yeah, sure. - Do you want to hang your coat? - Yeah, I'm fine. I've written some letters and been trying to get you to come in, but I haven't been fortunate. I asume that you are willing to go through with this? Investigation? How do you mean? You admitted to being guilty of battery and assault- - and for the court to be able to judge you- - a presentence investigation has to be made, for them to see who you are- - and what kind of legal action will be best suited for you. - And you're gonna do that? - Yes, and I believe you have received letters about it. - Well, that's possible. - Your occupation? I guess I don't have one, really. I work at the docks when I need money. - What do we call that? - I'll let you decide. - When were you born? -1-12-38. - Your parish of birth? - Er... Norway. - Where in Norway? - Telemark. Telemark, Norway. - Your father's name? - Teodor Johan Nilsen. - When was he born? - I really don't know. - Not even approximately? - Sometime before 1920. - What's his occupation? - He's a navvy and a tunnelworker. - Your mother's name? - Eva Helena. - And she was also born sometime around 1920? - Yeah, I guess. - Is she a housewife? - You could say that. - They are both alive? - Yes, they are both alive. - And they are not divorced? - Yes, they are. - When? - They got divorced in '51. - Any brothers or sisters? - A brother. - Does he also live in Norway? - Um, yes, he lives in Norway. - And you're not married? - That's right. - This is your own apartment? - Yes, it's my own. - You live here alone? - I live here alone. - But there are two beds... - There are two beds, yes. - No one else lives here? - No, but I still have two beds. - Is it ok if I have? - Yes, it's just that it appears to be more people living here. What it is?These questions are strange. If I have two beds... - As if having two beds is wrong... - No, it's good, one for each day... - It's unusual though. - Is it? The point of this is to have more people giving us their opinion of you- - and it's close at hand to think that someone else lives here that we can talk to. - But that's not the case? - No, it isn't. You come from your little bourgeois environment- - and you think you can investigate ME? What do you know about life at all? You're not qualified to sit here and discuss this- - and how the hell are you gonna judge me by psychological standards? - As I said, I'm just here to create the framework. - The framework? I haven't even gotten to the parts involving your mind- - or anything else to make you upset. - I'm not upset with you. I'm only upset with the conditions. You're prerequisites... Before you start asking for the conditions, you have to know what I do- - and what prerequisites I need to do this. Don't you think you should hold this outrage, until you see what this is about? - What do you mean by outrage? - Isn't it a bit affected, talking about the bourgeoisie... Affected? I asked what prerequisites you have to know anything at all? - Now, you're affected. - Yes, am I not allowed to be? I am inside my own apartment. If I want to act affected, then I will. I seriously doubt your capacity, to know anything about me or anything at all. You have no business here. Get the fuck out! Get out of here! - Calm down! - Go!You have no business here. This is my place. You have no God damn business here! No discussions. This is my place, you're not bringing any damn papers in here! "And I say to you; Bastard! General!Thief! Beast! Priest!" "Your world is nothing worth. Your conformity is nothing worth. " "Your goal is nothing worth. " "At ease!" - Hey! - Hi! It's you! Come on in! - Aren't you working today? - No, I've quit. - You quit? The dry cleaning? - Yeah. - Hang your coat. - Mhm. - What are you gonna do now? - I don't know. I thought I could live here, with you. - With me? - Yeah. If you want to? - What's that? - That's Stig. - Oh. Hi, Stig. - Hello. - Where are you putting that? - I thought it could go here by the window. What about the kitchen, out there? Why in the kitchen? Plants aren't supposed to be in the kitchen. - I just thought it's a bit big to go in here. - It's not that big, really. - You have a tall ceiling... - Would you make up your minds? Where can I put this down? - Huh? It's really heavy! - Put it in the kitchen! I hit a guy because he was driving around... because he was a big guy, you know- - out seducing secretaries and stuff. I was... I didn't like him. I explained the historical evolution to him, what will happen to us people and such. He didn't listen, he was a real snob. So I hit him, it was an act of aggression. I think I have told you this many times. - Are you easily affected? - No, i don't think so. At least not today. - Have you ever gotten angry like that before? - Yeah, but so have all people, gotten a bit angry. - More or less. - Yes, so where do we draw the line? - Have you ever hit anyone before? - Sure. I've been hit a lot too. - Haven't you? - In which way? - There's only one way, isn't it? - Can you give me an example? Yeah, in school, at sea you fight a bit. Not more than usual, though. I thought about something. Those people who develop mental defects- - defined mental defects, they get these through social circumstances. It's like when psychiatry not fully realizes the whole social complexity involving people- - but instead picks out potentially healthy people, stuff them with pills and then sends them home again. I mean, my God,what are you doing!This is theology, it's metaphysics, it's masturbating you're involved with here! What the hell are you doing here? Your damn bourgeois intelligence tests, it's a weapon. The whole school of psychology is a weapon of your class. Psychology exists to oppress people, God damn it! You realize this, right? Psychology, what is it based on? What is psychology? What is your science based on? - It's hot, can I take my sweater off? - Of course. Unless it's considered neurotic to sweat? What are you laughing at? - Do you think I'm funny? - No. I want a definition of your science, and it's function in society- - unless it's for adapting people to society. And what society is that, then? That's a class society. A bourgeois society with a bourgeois philosophy- - the economic oppression, you know what I mean. Capitalist society. The worker. The ones who protest, wind up with psychologists, where they are dissected and adjusted. Healthy people being adjusted to a sick society. That's my opinion of psychology. - Well, opinions differ on that matter. - Really? Can I hear your opinion? - No, I don't think I should mention that here. - Well, in that case we don't have anything to talk about. - Could we leave this subject now? - Absolutely not. Before I can approve of your questions, I wanna know by which standards- - what the bottom line is of this science, by which you seek to control me. If you can't explain this, I won't discuss anything with you. I don't accept your prerequisites. So, start talking. Defend yourself. I'm not gonna hit you, I promise. I have nothing to defend. But you mentioned that as a result of your having been hit- - your environment has changed you? - No, but I have become aggressive- - and you must know that to upset a dog, you need to hit it. Aggressions are the brain's defence against pressure. I want to hear what you can do for me there, exceptfor destroying me, that is. Well, you could talk about these conditions by talking about yourself- - the early memories and further on. School, what happened after school... You know, we have no contact with each other. This is totally insignificant, the details. I could tell you about my whole week. You have the story in broad strokes, my logic and my defence for my actions- - and the fact that society has made me who I am. That's where we stand. And you want to hear the details,what happened on May first, 1945, at eight in the evening? Could you tell me more about being hit? - In more detail. - I was orphaned, for example. I've been in jail... A normal, working class human being is placed in an industry environment- - where he is supposed to produce for the upper class and the share holders. He's meant to end his days there. One that has a little spunk inside,will go out and steel the president's car instead. One that has a fire inside, won't stand for it- - or accept it. He won't submit himself to that environment. I'd rather go out and steel the son of a bitch's car and drive it the hell away. You're the psychopaths. Only a psychopath can support a system that even a five year old can see is unfair. "The patient has lately been showing increasing difficulties to adapt. " "Earlier, he has been working as a longshoreman from time to time- - but during this year probably mostly been unemployed. " "The rootlessness, lack of of social adaptation and lack of lasting human relations- - which always seem to have been there, have obviously grown more intense during his stay in Stockholm. " "With this, his tendency to project has increasingly taken on the form of a political activity, driven to the extreme left. " "His personal difficulties he has increasingly... " "His personal difficulties, he manages to transform- - into notions of the injustice of the "class society". "His general and uncontrollable aggressiveness, he explains to be a resistance- - against what he calls the'crime of the god damn president'." "His statement on the righteousness of the assault- - and the statements on the upper class'theft' from the 'proletariat' illustrates this. " "Mental state:The patient appears motoricly uneasy, undisciplined- - and without social inhibitions. " "He sees the investigator as a representative of the bourgeoisie- - he expresses an identification with antisocial norms and an admiration for those who break society's laws. " "Intellectually, he seems to be a bit above average, but emotionally chaotic- - defiant, uninhibited, primitive, restless, tense, affective, aggressive and destructive. " - Hey! - Hey! I have something really great here. Remember when Ragnar went to prison? You know,when he saw those shrinks- - "maybe they wanted to send him off to another hospital, where they could research his antisocial expressions- - inflated football heads burning around him in white coats- - taking his pulse and asking him stupid questions; 'What do you think about when I say "horse"?"' - Huh? - WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT WHEN I SAY "HORSE"? "They would listen to his ears, take photos of his skull to find defects- - and stage marathon debates in a language that no one understood. " - Huh? - THAT NO ONE UNDERSTOOD! Come on over, and I'll tell you more. Come on! Well, you know what they're like, right? He's consuming himself, while his car is growing. He's got a nice little garden that he tends to, with white shoes and nice shorts. And he's got an automatic lawn mower and a car that grows and grows- - and the neighbour is wondering:"What the hell is wrong with that God damn car?" As it turns out, this guy is inside his house, eating himself- - while his car is growing. But this story is... I'd rather tell the one about the Virgin Mary. Mm, tell me about her, then. She gets a case of DAMP, right? She enters the church- - and inside, this gang of believers sits. These yellowish... disgusting masochists. They sit there and the Virgin Mary really comes to visit them- - and they almost tear her head off. - I don't think you can handle those stories. - Well, you had something else you wanted to tell me. - What was it? - I don't remember what it was. - No, I can't. I have to go. - No, wait, have you heard this one- - about the guy who got cerebral palsy? - No. It's a creepy story about a man who was amputated. He amputates himself in a strange fashion, a kind of mental amputation. One day he wakes up and his leg is gone, the next day his knee- - and on the third day everything's gone up to here. He peels himself, bit by bit. It's a damned scary story, I get the shivers while I'm telling it. No, let me tell it to you. He's peeled of like this, and then up to here... No, I have to go now. - Have you heard the one about the priest that goes to hell? - No, I don't want to hear that one. Hey,what does it mean to act destructively? Huh? - Björn? - Mm. - If a person is destructive? - He messes up stuff. - He messes up things? - Mm. - What's "clienteel"? - Clienteel? - Mhm. - What's the context? - The group, whose clienteel... - No, it's pronounced "clientele". So, what is it? Hey! Hello? - Why won't you answer me? - What the hell are you reading? I'm reading "Investigation on sociopaths", or what it's called. - Ok, but that's no longer current. - It's not? Knut gave it to me. It's gonna be called "Highly demanding patients". Just because it's called differently, doesn't mean it is different, right? He told me this was dangerous for people like him, and that I should watch my step too. Mhm. You're not listening. - Björn! Is it dangerous? - No, it's not dangerous. - Are you "highly demanding"? - I don't know, he told me- - that I should watch it. - What are you reading? - I'm reading, yeah. - What? - About the "new subculture taking shape". - What culture is that? - They call it the"guerilla culture". - I'm in a picture here. - Let me see! - Look at that!You're in the paper? - Yeah. It's nothing. - What are you doing? It says"Police". - Street theater, it was sometime last summer. Björn! Björn! Come and see! - What is it? - Come and look. - Look, it's grown another leaf. - Well, I'll be damned! What do you have against my monstera? Nothing, but we can't live in a God damn green house. - Huh? - WE CAN'T LIVE IN AGOD DAMN GREEN HOUSE! - "... he's been glancing at my daughter, see?" - "I hear ya. " "And they say that girl gets so skinny durin' summer- - but I haven't said anything yet, it's just talk. " "And when they got back from town, they wore gold watches, no less" "And she was FAT, you know. When did that happen?" "When did the priest get here? Just count the months from then. " "Now I know why we're out of booze. " "Listen... - - writing, that's alright- - but you have to experience something to understand it. " "Right?" "What about you? Know any real workers? "Do you even know what you're doing?" "If that asshole Norwegian would shut up, so I could concentrate. " - "I'm trying to get you in the mood. " - "The mood, huh? Let me tell you something. " "I went up, right. After that dispute, I went right up to the boss- - and said that'If I can't drive with suspenders on, I won't drive at all. " Here you sit and you imitate workers. How could you do that? You've never even seen a worker! Maybe you've seen a taxi driver on the way home from one of your posh restaurants! - Who was gonna do the talking here? - You! Yeah. Then, shut up! Checkmate! Here's your stupid pawn! - Checkmate? - Yes. I've got different rules. Do you think you can checkmate me with your stupid bourgeois rules? Do you think you can win with your damn bourgeois rules? You're trying to... you're trying to get away. You're funny. Two plus two is four, only if you accept the mathematical system. Two plus two is five. But you have still lost. - Here are my rooks. - I've lost? - Yes, you've lost... - Ok, let's switch the stupid pawn, then! Is it loaded? Look, how it shines. Beautiful thing. Do you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the walls, the thick doors. These walls, you know- - thick iron doors that the upper class keeps closed to protect their privileges- - and the German shepherds they let loose on people. - It wasn't loaded. - Hmm. Do you feel this? It's kind of romantic and hip to be a revolutionary- - but what would you do if the revolution really came? You would shit your pants. Huh? That's the only way you bourgeois kids revolt, right? You revolt against your fathers, your firm fathers? You become the worst thing he can imagine- a leftist. Right? But what you really do is push the proletariat away. That's why you're fascists in your own special way. See? Leftist-nazis. Those are the sons of the bourgeois, you see. They have only switched horses, you see. The nazis switch horses, you see. - I'm gonna shoot your protest beard off. - You're crazy. Cut it out! Björn!What are you doing? You're crazy. Berit? Berit? Goodbye, Ophelia. Remember what I've said. When you first met Berit, her views were pretty narrow. Sure, she knew about certain things, but she had yet to see them clearly. The complexity of the society she was born into, you gave her the tools to understand it. You got her to reflect upon her own situation. But the moment she left, that's when you let her down. You, a revolutionary socialist, are supposed to educate the proletariat, not just sleep with them? - I did, didn't I? I educated her. - Yeah? That's what you're saying. You're saying I got her to quit her job and start thinking. Well, that's grand. And what's she doing now? The only thing you did was to tear down her whole world, and make her unhappy. You couldn't imagine taking care of that girl- - and see to it that she became educated, like yourself for example? Yeah, but I couldn't do that. I just couldn't. But maybe that's your task? But I can't do it. Why are you a socialist? Can you explain to me why the hell you're a socialist? You don't mind waiting a while, do you? Ijust have to finish this. What are you writing? What I'm writing? It's about Gothemburg, it has to do with minimum wages. It's to be sent... they want it monday. That's why I'm in a damn hurry. You're kind of busy, right? Busy as hell. I'm also starting a thing for tv right now- - about the sociopaths. I have an article on sociopaths here that you can read, it would do you good. While you're waiting. You make a decent living at what you do, right? What do you mean? Something wrong with that? No, but it seems tough. I couldn't do it. But you can't write for shit, either. You're not committed. You have to be committed to get something done. All you do is quit. Could you see if there is any mail over there? So, talk about what you wanted to talk about. I'lljust look through the mail at the same time. - I'm listening. - Yeah, sure. Ijust thought you could give me some advice. You seem to be doing so damn well. Sure. About what? Well, how do you do it? Economically. You're holding my work against me? - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do. Well, couldn't you use your commitment to do something else? Like you, for example? Walk around with a grave face and sigh? - So, what do you think I should do? - You could start working, for real. Work at a youth centre or something. What can you change working at a youth centre? You can change yourself. You damn well need it. Two lizards fighting each other. They're gaping and preparing for a big fight somewhere, some 250 million years ago. - Do you see his feet?They're ready to run. - Mhm. - Do you see his feet?They're ready to run. - Mhm. It's something competitive about it. They're exactly the same, it's logical. - All done? Anything else? - Upside-down it looks monkeys in a tree. Look. They're sitting on the edge, looking. It's just one monkey, come to think of it. But it's two, as there are two figures. Thank you. - This job is fun? - Mhm. - Let's take this one. - That one? I think it looks like a bird- - or a bat. It's always something with birds. Or it could be an ass. Is it right that sexual neurotics are not able to see sexual symbolics, because they repress them? Isn't that right?To you as a psychologist, I'm gonna explain something psychological. People from the higher classes are brought up in a strictly anti-sexual fashion- - not all of them, but many. And for a woman with a normal sex life- - but with a strictly anti-sexual upbringing, the solution is the dream of getting raped- - where she can live out her sexuality without guilt. There she can live out her sexual needs, without feeling any guilt. That's the dream of rape, right? - Mm, perhaps that's it. - Perhaps? That IS it. Perhaps? That's why I wonder if it's the same for you. Well, this is not the time to talk about my life. But I'm expected to talk about mine, right? - What shallow personalities people have. - Do you think so? They smile, but still seem so distant...

" "God's angels in their white vestment, with the fairest of faces- - they watch over you as well. " "You sleep well, you lie softly. The cradle you were given rocks gently. " Are you going to heaven? Not me. Do you know why? Do you know why? 'Cause there are only boring people there- - priests, doctors and half - crazy missionaries. But in hell, my brother. There the interesting ones dwell, Marx, Nietzsche, Kant... Let's calm down, shall we? - Did you finish it yet? - No, it's a slow son of a bitch. We live in a jar, do you feel that? In a jar, like jam. Armoured glass on the windows, society stuck us down here. Here's where we're supposed to stay. They've put the lid back on, shrunk us to nothing. They have control over us that way. What happens out there is the same that happens in here. The oppression. But it's much worse in here, less room to move. "Care"... "Care"... "Care"... Here we are with our board games. - Here we sit and become idiots! - What the hell are you doing? Is there anything in here that can stimulate us into getting "well"? We're becoming sicker instead. There's no activity here. Look at this deck and these marbles, it's fucking crazy! - Ok, let's settle down now. - I can't speak? - Yes, but you can't... - I can't speak now? I can't speak? I'm not allowed to speak any more? I'm a person with the gift of speech,just for that purpose! I don't believe in this place, therefore I speak and that is my right. Or am I to be gagged now? Am I? You can cut off our tongues and make sure we stay quiet! This is assault! This is crazy. If we were healthy when we got here, we'll go crazy in here. Don't you see? It's like a vacuum. The only ones we have contact with are these deranged guards, running around in their suits. Nothing happens, life stands completely still here. Won't anything happen? Can't they see to it that we get to do something, we're going crazy! What kind of society is this, who fucks people like this? Hey, Jesus, wake up! What kind of society is this? You sit there with your chess board. I'm going crazy in here. Why can't we do something? Any God damn thing, I don't care what. What I accuse, is the manner in which people are treated. Because people are "maladjusted" they are sent here to this jar- - with steel frames on the windows, to stay for a hundred years. Is that what the "maladjusted" need? Aren't they in need of some sort of care? What the hell is this? The longer we stay in here, the more maladjusted we become. - This system is crazy! - What are you doing about it? What can I do? What can I do in these surroundings? I'm not accusing you or me, I'm accusing the system. We're at the lowest point in society, at the bottom of the pyramid. And it's called CARE! Mental CARE! Who designed this care? It must have been a complete lunatic! Lunatics built this place! THEYshould go here, not we! And you're so God damn wasted, you're all asleep! You're playing with your game there, and you'll be doing it for a hundred years! It will only be a pile of bones left at your table! You're rotting, that's what will remain. When you and your big mouth have rotted, what do you think will remain? It won't matter if you yell, we're not getting out anyway. You're not the only one that have yelled. - Are we feeling any healthier? - No. So, we're becoming sicker. Someone must understand this? Does anyone realize this? No, that's right, no one. Hence the vacuum. They have taken out all the air. If we shout until we drop dead, it still won't reach the outside. That's right. Hell. The flowers are growing. Nice flowers. Do you want a flower to smell? The last one you'll ever get. Won't you come with us now. - Pull it, God damn it! - Should I pull it? Are we all set now? Are you sure you're the best now? The strongest, your society? Why don't you take out my brain right now, and save yourselves the treatment of me. Where the hell is the nurse? Who do we have here? Nilsen, that was the sedation, right? He's on Klorpromex, 50 mg x 3 now. He got 75 mg yesterday. I think we'll up the Klorpromex to 75 mg x 3, and add 50 mg Nozinan at night as well. - That's good. And he... - Doctor, could you remove this belt? We'll have to keep it for a while. You brought it on yourself. - Brought it on myself? - Yes. You understand what I'm saying? There was an incident yesterday. - Doctor, may I tell you a story? - Yes, a short one then. It's a story about people. It starts with a fish. There's a fish in the Mediterranean somewhere, a tiny one. It has no teeth. That's why the bigger fish tend to have it for dinner regularly. That is until it got the idea to start swallowing water. It swallowed and swallowed until it got as large as a mountain- - and then no one dared to attack it anymore. Do you see what I mean? Yes. That's fine then. - Can I say one more thing? - Yes, but be brief. No, it's pointless. Subtitles;JBOX C. 2009 JBOX
