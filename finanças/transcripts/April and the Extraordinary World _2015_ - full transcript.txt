July 18, 1870. On the eve of the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III and General Bazaine pay a secret visit to a young scientist, Gustave Franklin. So, Gustave, is my serum ready? Your Majesty, my research yielded surprising results. The serum altered my subjects, but not the way I expected. You'll see, it's extraordinary. Rodrigue! Chimène! Don't be shy, kids. Say hello to the Emperor. - Hello to the Emperor! - Hello to the Emperor! Those animals talk? - Yes, they're... - Invincible? - No... - Don't mess with me, Gustave! Where's the Ultimate Serum to make my soldiers invincible? War is coming. You promised me a secret weapon, and all I see are two freaks! I have no time for silly games. Bazaine! Shoot those things. Too bad if they're not invincible! Yes, Your Majesty! No, wait! - Boom! - Boom? There, there... Sleep, Prosper. That's just Daddy working. And that's how Napoleon III, Emperor of France, met his end. The next day, his son Louis-Napoleon becomes Napoleon IV and signs a peace treaty with Prussia. The course of history is changed. The war of 1870 never happens, and the Napoleon dynasty continues to reign over France. Several years later, all over the world, scientists mysteriously begin to disappear. Police throughout the world are stumped. No one knows what happened to Branly, Einstein, Hertz, Marconi, Nobel, Pasteur and so many other promising young scientists. With the best scientists gone, the world is forced to rely on outdated science, deprived of electricity, radio, television and dozens of other important inventions. Without oil or the atom, humanity relies massively on coal. The mines run dry and coal is replaced by charcoal. European forests are flattened, and an energy crisis ensues. The French Empire fights the Americas for control of Canadian forest land. To win this war, the Empire needs scientists to improve its weaponry. Its best policemen pursue the few who haven't disappeared and refuse to work for the army. Thus, 70 years later, Gustave's son, Prosper Franklin, and his son Paul, are in hiding to pursue Gustave's research. They are fugitives now, in 1931, with the world still stuck in the Age of Steam! April and the Twisted World Dad? I knew I'd find you here. I can't help it. I need to see it every day. I know, it's the last one and reminds you of before. But today we have something important to finish. It's risky to come here. They'll capture you! I keep telling you, I can't help it. 5 cents a song! 5 cents! Please! Charge forth! Soldiers of our Empire Raise your swords The enemy must perish! Charge forth! Mow them down without a frown! Shoot fearlessly For our future Full steam ahead We will cross The ocean To wage the final battle As the bugles blare And the bullets fly Their forests will be ours! Their charcoal will be ours! Don't tell Annette. I never do. Inspector, they're back! We can nab the whole family. Officer, it took us weeks to track them down. Give me 10 more minutes to finish my nap. Prosper, where've you been? I had to mix it myself! I'm Pops! And it's none of your business. Annette, darling! You two can argue another time. This is supposed to be the big day! Filtration? Ready. Enzymatic insertion? Done. Molecular hybridization? Successful. Mutagenic agent injection? Injecting. Emulsions 1 and 2? Here they are! April, not now! Are we gonna mix this thing? Buttercup, the best way to help us is to stay put and not touch anything. Where were we? - Emulsions 1 and 2? - Here. - Hydrostatic pressure? - Good, stable... Stop making that face! Come play. Forget stinky old chemistry! Darwin, chemistry is what made you talk. You're proud of your parents? It was a failed experiment. I was supposed to be an invincible cat! This time, if we got it right, we've created the Ultimate Serum! The Ultimate Serum! All forms of life will be invincible. Sickness, old age and death will be no more. A more worthy goal than invincible soldiers, Grandpa. We made the same mistakes as you, but today we will finally succeed. We can now test on our guinea pig. Prosper, please... Pops, I'm Pops! Inspector Pizoni here! Imperial Security! We've got you surrounded! Remember, I want them alive. You're under arrest for breaking the law! All scientists must serve the Empire! Open up! The serum! They mustn't get it! Open up! The trapdoor, quick! Come on! Hurry! - Pops! - I'll distract them. Meet you at the Steam Mobile! Get going! Hands up! My pleasure. Surprise! Hands up! Turn off the boiler. With the hands up it won't be easy. Will this help? The boiler! Aim for the boiler! Dad! Grandpa! Freeze! Get back here, you swine! Our only hope is the train station! Annette! April! You okay? Nothing broken? Attention please, Platform 2. Immediate boarding for the 1:47 to Berlin. There! Arrest them! In the name of the Empire! Arrest them! Platform 2, Paris-Berlin is leaving. Third-class passengers are forbidden to speak to other passengers. We wish you a pleasant voyage. Farewell, Paris. What about Grandpa? He's smarter than the police, I'm sure he's fine. In Berlin we'll find a way to contact him. There are police in Berlin, too. We must hide the serum. Arrest them! In the name of the Empire! You dirty swine! Where are you hiding? The life baskets! Annette, quick! Close, you darn thing! Annette, what're you doing? Coming! Stop! Don't move! Party's over! You're under arrest. For real this time. April! Mom! Dad! A cable car destroyed! Prized scientists we've been after for weeks, dead! IMPERIAL HOSPITAL Vaporized! Like the passengers and your men. Prosper Franklin, another prized scientist, missing! The girl is mute, useless to us. Pizoni, I ask you again, what happened? I already told you. A storm, then everything blew to smithereens! It's the old schnook's fault! I almost had them. Grandpa's gonna pay when I'm out! No more disasters! No more hunting scientists! That's an order! When you're out, you'll catch bums and potato thieves, Officer Pizoni! That's right, Officer. You're an inspector no more! You can thank the Empire. You'll be cared for and placed in an orphanage. They don't like head lice there. Halt! Police! I want a word with the little girl. Sorry about what happened to your parents. Tough break for you. But you still have your grandpa, Prosper Franklin. You wanna find him, right? Come on, you must know where he is. Talk, say something! Cat got your tongue? Come back! Stop her! So? So nothing. She's gone. I give up. April Franklin! Hide all you like, I'll find you! And your grandpa, too! I'll throw him in the clink and be an inspector again! Beware, Franklin family! Beware the wrath of Gaspard Pizoni! 10 years later... June 18, 1941. Napoleon V and Victoria II over the Channel, inaugurating the long-awaited bridge linking England to France. Rome. Another scientist has mysteriously disappeared. No trace of poor Enrico Fermi. Unrest in the Americas. Battles wage off the coast of Canada. Once again, our Imperial Navy was almost victorious! The Paris-Berlin cable car is running again! Enjoy high-speed travel! Eighty-two comfortable hours will get you from one capital to the other. Summer's coming! Cover up, change your mask filters, and head down to the Summer Funfair! Exciting rides and thrilling attractions await! You like chemistry? Got anything recent? 'Fraid not, little lady. Nothing new in science for a century. Right. Then I'll take that one. Consider it done. CHEMISTRY TREATY SUMMER FUNFAIR Watch where you're going! They should chuck you in prison! Pardon me, sorry! Dang it! I'm home! French poems Darwin! You know reading wears you out. I'll read to you, okay? What's it like outside? Same as always. War. Another scientist missing, in Rome. And there's a bridge between England and France. Blasted soot! I got you this. And some glucose. Perrault, Puss in Boots... Thanks, but we have it. Did you forget? It was your favorite story back when I read to you. Sorry, I had no time to choose. Darwin, what's Rome like? You should've retained my geography lessons. There's more to life than chemistry. Rome is beautiful! The Colosseum. Bernini's Throne. I'll never see them. Don't be silly. April! Reading exhausts me, my head hurts. I've got more soot than air in my lungs. Soon, it'll smell better here. You won't have my litter box to clean. Nonsense! Your brain's overheating. I'll take your temperature. Leave my backside alone! My muzzle's hotter than yesterday, and my fever's not going down. I'll find that serum, and you'll get well! A new friend is what you should find. I don't need anyone. You're afraid you'll meet someone and lose them. But cable cars only blow up once in a lifetime. Sorry. It's ready. Drink this and shut your feline trap! How's the food? I come here mainly for the view. So? No news. She goes out daily to steal stuff. Always alone. Never sees anyone. And I can't find her hideout. I always lose her on that square. She exits and enters, and poof! And the old guy, Prosper? I keep telling you! She never sees anyone. Why don't you let it go? You've hunted that old guy for 10 years. Hunt other scientists. I'm getting tired of tailing that girl. I'd rather spy on a prettier one. She's no prize. Radishes or mushrooms? Listen up! You're still green so I'll explain again. I'll nab Prosper if it takes 10 more years! Do the job or go back to jail! Punks like you are a dime a dozen. Calm down, I read you! What are my orders? One, find her hideout. Two, make sure she doesn't get caught stealing. Three, let me eat in peace. You must've had a rough childhood. Get lost. THE FLYING PIGEON And the cat began to speak... "In return for your favor, I will make you happy. "Give me just a bag and a pair of boots and I will make your fortune." So? Sorry I didn't make your fortune. Dummy! How do you feel? The serum should've worked. If I may say, you should change your recipe. Molecular hybridization failed due to incomplete polymerization. I didn't have enough reagents. Potassium permanganate, - dioxygen... - In French, please. I didn't have enough of certain ingredients. But I know where to find them! Summer Funfair... "The Magic and Wonders of Chemistry." With any luck, I'll find what I need. I'm coming with you! In your condition? No way! Come on down! See the bearded Siamese twin ladies! Free admission for soldiers. The Lovers' Carousel April! I'd love to dance. Cat's don't dance. Or talk! So keep quiet. And with the magic of boric acid... Abracadabra... A green flame! The color of hope! THE MAGIC AND WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY Thank you! I see you're itching to see the next miracle. Lithium, potassium, calcium... A fiery rainbow! Hop to it! April! He's coming! What the heck? Hurry up! I got you, missy! Stop her! Stop, thief! Hurry up! Hurry up! A talking cat! - Maximum surveillance, send in a rat-spy! - Right away! Thief! Stop her! Honey, where've you been? I lost you! Open your purse! How dare you? Hands off my girlfriend! Better watch your girlfriend. If she weren't here I'd shove that clown hat you know where! Little lost Leopold awaits his mother by the molten boiler. Your tiger doesn't look so hot. I don't know what to say... Thanks. I think these are yours. Magic, eh? You do magic with this stuff, too? I'd love to see it, at your place. Listen... Thanks again, but you wouldn't like my place. And I'm not alone. Better leave it at that. Filtration, good. Enzymatic insertion, molecular hybridization, mutagenic agent injection... And colloidal solution, now! Oxidation-reduction... Glycolysis... Not quite what I wanted, but it could work. You could be cured! Come on, come on... What's it like to be kissed? Did he bite you? Lick your tongue? - Did you like it? - Drink this. And shut up. It should be working. Do you feel anything? Thanks for a wonderful day. Now I can go... Go where? Silly sausage! I'll meet Homer, Plato, Shakespeare... Perrault, too. I have a thing or two to tell him about cats. April... I'm thirsty. Darwin? Darwin! It's your fault! Why'd I listen to you? You never should've gone out in that rotten soot! And this... This is rotten, too! Everything's rotten, lousy, useless! Everything! CHEMISTRY AND COAL THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS Don't expect me to clean up the mess! Darwin? You're cured? That tickles! How can it be? Here's your answer. One sip and I'm fit as a fiddle! Hang on. You drank this, and you're not sick anymore? Mom gave me this ball the last day I saw her. The serum! The last version they didn't have time to test! Somehow they injected it here and you drank some. My parents succeeded! The Ultimate Serum works! It's better than chicken soup! I feel like I swallowed a panther! You may applaud. What are you doing here? Nothing, just admiring the view! Help me! Thanks. Boy, was I scared! I almost peed in Napoleon's eye! So, Romeo? Love got you climbing the walls? Spying on me? I said to leave me alone. Is he part of your act? - April, buttercup, it's Dad. - Dad? Listen, I don't have much time. You're in danger. They're coming. Leave immediately. The oak! Get to the oak, fast. With luck, you'll find... Darwin! Sorry, instinct. Can't control it. What is this thing? How can it be? Dad... Alive? Something's going on outside. We have to leave. Now! Where are you going? Your place. A smart aleck like you must sleep somewhere. You'll put us up for the night. Thanks! What? Got a problem? Don't like people dropping in unannounced? And don't get fresh! No more sharing saliva. Darwin will keep watch while I sleep. I think she likes you. Where do you live? - What happened? - There you are! - Where's the rat? - Got him, he's in the lab. What happened? We had the serum, but she fled like she'd been warned. She was. Someone hijacked the rat-spy. Come, everything's ready. My love, you're too easy on those humans. The scientists have too much freedom. Punish him. Brutality is against our principles. Paul Franklin, please rise. You erased your transmission. What'd you tell your daughter? You know the project could succeed, with April's help. Where can we find her? You'll soon be smiling less and talking more. Rodrigue! Just a little intimidation. You don't want to tell us, but might be more chatty with someone else. You may enter now. Sweet! Do these pay the rent? I found them. I'm a collector. Got a problem with that? Sleep there, I'll take the corner. There's the bucket for... You know what. Do you stand up or go like normal cats? I'm normal! I like my privacy. By the way, I'm Julius. Good night, Julius. What happened at the statue? No idea. Why does your cat talk? He just does. Was that rat like Darwin? I don't think so. Did you lose your parents? What's it to you? Why the questions? You're young, you live alone... I doubt it's for fun. I know how it is. I never knew who my dad and mom were. At least you don't know what you're missing. So, you've got nobody? A brother, an uncle, a grandfather? None of your business! Darwin and I are leaving tomorrow. You can go on collecting watches. Now let me sleep. I could help you. Think it over. I already told you, I don't need anyone. Thanks to him, you avoided arrest and got your dad's message! Julius, do you know where to find an oak in Paris? - A what? - An oak. A tree. I know one place, just one. We've been here for hours. What're we waiting for? I have no idea. Be quiet and wait. OAK (QUERCUS) "Some strains could live 1,100 years. "Oak trees were found throughout Europe. "Three specimens remain." Not interested? No, Dr. Darwin, the Boring Scientist! Don't look at me. Don't look at me! 101 Bayonet Street in Sèvres. To get in press "1931 Stay here another hour. I must leave alone. What're you doing? He said to wait! Weren't you in a hurry? Annette! I watched those screens for 10 years! I finally find April, and you play cop for those wackos! Don't you realize April has what we're looking for? Here, despite the best equipment and biologists, we've failed every time. Thanks to her, and to the Ultimate Serum, the project will become a reality! Where is April? What did you tell her? Paul, April will be safe here. We'll be a family again. We'll work together. Together? You don't want to find her. You want to recruit her for your sick dream! It used to be your dream, too. I woke up! April will not be safe here! There's no scientific proof the project won't end in disaster! I'm sorry, I don't want my daughter anywhere near this insanity. Our daughter. BOUTARDIEU BOILERS Anyone home? They're real! Did you see? April? Know where we are? Yes. April! Why didn't you wait like I told you? Ten years I've looked for you. Everywhere. Orphanages, hospitals... Even cemeteries! At the Memorial, I wasn't sure. But I saw Darwin and knew it was you! How you've grown! You too, Darwin. Look! I even bought some cakes. Who is this young man? Why'd you come so early? I wanted to wait for you and make it a surprise. The party is spoiled. Some reunion this is! It's a swell reunion, Grandpa. Pops! I'm Pops. You forgot. How'd you find me? That tree was a secret between me and your father. Yesterday I got a message from Dad. If he's alive, Mom must be, too. And that's not all. In here... The formula from 10 years ago. It cured Darwin! You succeeded! It's the Ultimate Serum! Can you explain? Not a good time. Paul and Annette, alive? Impossible! Were you better at convincing him? Paul won't talk. You won't hurt him, will you? You know we won't. Darwin swallowed the serum in the ball. After his recovery, Paul transmitted a message to you via a rat fitted with unknown technology. Then, the black cloud and lightning, and your lab, kaput! Who's behind all this, and why? Maybe to get this? The serum. What's this? What's it do? It's a prototype, never used. Get your paws off it! So... Let's assume your aggressors are trying to procure the serum. But that won't help us find your parents. We have no leads, no clues... Yes, we do. The rat. You're right! If I examine him, I'll surely unearth a clue. - I'm going to the statue. - Me, too. Is that a good idea? He's right, it's too dangerous. I lost you once, that's enough. Stay here, it's safe. I've seen to that. Don't worry about me. In 10 years, I've become an expert at blending in. Pops? - Yes? - You have chalk on your nose. One last thing, don't touch the serum. We must examine it, test it. You'll find a change of clothing upstairs. Pizoni! You're wanted on the iteraphone! Pizoni! About time. Pizoni, Imperial Police. Yes? It's me. I found the old guy, Pops. I know where to nab him. But you must keep your word. Not until he's in handcuffs. And the girl? Gone. Don't ask me where, I have no idea. Julius? Julius... What do you think? Julius? Julius? A signal! Electromagnetic activity! Another one discovered electricity. Send a rat-spy to scout it out. Don't just stand there! Help me! Do something! What's with you? You okay? Don't make a sound, freeze. Turn around. Make up your mind. Do I turn around or do I freeze? Always the wise guy, Pops. Turn around. Souvenir! Bring back memories? Prosper Franklin! Better late than never. Now you can fix my career. Right away! Arrest him. What? Seriously? Stop it! Thanks for the capture, Pizoni. But orders are orders, even 10 years on. You were forbidden to approach scientists. You could've caused another disaster with your talents. - Pops! - Darwin! Warn April. In case of danger, use the globe! Uruguay! With a U, like urgency! You swine! - Come on! Off we go! - This is an outrage! To Fort La Latte! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! You won't tell me where you were? Outside. I needed to think. - I have to tell you something. - I'm listening. The thing is... I can't stay. We found her, at last. How'd you locate her? An electric signal. This time we'll get the serum. So you're leaving? In the middle of the night? You could've told Pops goodbye. Sorry, but it's really for the best. Darwin will be so sad. I think he liked you. Darwin? Darwin! April, April! Pops has been arrested! What? How? Where'd they take him? To Fort La Latte. Wherever that is! Gentlemen, the Fort La Latte staff welcomes you to the Empire's most secure secret base. A place immune to your disasters, Pizoni. A charming 14th century chamber awaits you! Prosper Franklin, your brain cells will be working for the Empire now. Try to help us win the war. That'll be all. My good man, what exactly is this place? A research lab. People like you try to make new weapons. They pulled a wreck from the sea. We don't know what it is. This is our 19th attempt. I have a bad feeling. Here we go. Let's get lunch. What an absolute marvel! We don't know where it's from or who made it. If you have any ideas we missed, get to work. "Fort La Latte, Brittany. "A deserted medieval fort on a cliff." How do we get there? By paw? Julius, any idea? - What're you doing? - Geography does come in handy! Dear visitor, if you can hear me, you're in dire straits! Welcome to my Meta-Mansion! To steer the Meta-Mansion to the location of your choice, type your destination on the keyboard. For all other information, refer to the user's manual. What is this place? Where are we going? To find Pops. Where are we? The bottom of the Seine. April could've been hurt. Change your methods. My dear, if you know a peaceful way to wipe out that shack on legs, wonderful. Meanwhile let me fly. Thank you. This is Normandy? No wonder we're stuck eating fish and mushrooms. The countryside's gone. - This trip's got me down! - Be patient. Just a few more hours. - Julius? - Yeah? I know you didn't have a choice, but thanks for helping me find Pops. At your service. You're in love! Don't you have cat stuff to do? Lick your butt or eat a rat? You're in love! Give that cat a shot! His brains are boiling over! No time. I'm kind of preparing an attack. My dear colleagues, your method is totally wrong. The energy generated by this machine clearly flows here. So the cables should be plugged in here and here. We've wondered for years. What's the energy? A phenomenon long known, but never mastered. Electricity! Magnetism, or lightning... Tremendous! This machine is a masterpiece. A bouquet of cables! What's going on? The doors! Quick! Alert! Alert! Evacuate! Everyone out! Run! To the stairs! Ready? Here we go. Help! Open up! Open up! This down here, this up there... Pops! Pops! Dang! Where's the blasted exit? No idea. Keep going! Pops! Pops? Pops? April? You shouldn't have, it's too dangerous. Excuse me, but we're kind of surrounded in a sinking castle. Just give me a minute. I'm about to get this marvel working. Got a screw loose? Come on! To your motor shack! - My house! - Sorry. We have to find another way out. Hands up! Next time we won't miss! Get in! Hang on! - There's a door... - I'm on it, young man! It's calm now. Maybe we should land? We need to know our position first. We're flying at night with no visibility, and the guidance system doesn't work. So... We're lost at sea in a busted contraption? There's no danger. Automatic pilot. It works. I must say, I'm doing a pretty good job. - If you're so good, where are we? - No idea. Could be the North Pole, could be Madagascar. We'll know once I repair the locating machine. But first, I'd like some explanations from you, young man. Pizoni, the officer who handled my arrest, had two bits of information he wasn't supposed to have. One, my family nickname... Pops! Two, the place I was going, the statue of Napoleon. I see no reason why April, Darwin or myself would've turned me in. Julius, why did you do that? You lied to me? The whole time? You used me, just to give Pops to the cops! I had no choice. It was that or jail! But I came back. For you! Just to say goodbye. I wish you hadn't. Don't touch me! And don't talk to me. Pizoni told me Pops would work for the Empire and be well-treated. I figured it was okay. But all that was before... Before you fell in love. You were just dumb at the wrong time. Thanks. Okay... Now it's going to work. Now what? Come on! Dear scientist, welcome aboard. We're Rodrigue and Chimène, your new masters. In nice surroundings far from your government's stupidity, your talents are at our service. All science is useful. Like your cruel species, we have learned that power is knowledge. With your expertise, our technological superiority will forever prevail. We will explain our aim at a later stage. If you have an illness or defect, please report it. Your diet will be strictly vegetarian. In case of airsickness, please use the sick bags. We wish you a pleasant trip. Lizards? Lizards kidnapped Mom and Dad? I believe, in actual fact, they're dragons. Where are they? On Airocopter 13. We can locate and hear them, but not see them. Airocopter 13 was lost in a storm. How'd they get it? Doesn't matter, we located April. Prepare for takeoff! I'll bring that Airocopter back! No. We know the outcome of your methods. Rodrigue, let me handle this. Sorry I got carried away. If you know a way to bring April back safely, I'm at your service. Chimène, never criticize me in front of the children! Reptiles who talk... Like Darwin. We'll figure that out later. First we need to know where we are. If I can get this pile of junk working! Dear friends, thanks for coming. April, I can't wait to see you, and your serum. They've taken over the Airocopter! The controls have stopped working! Where are you going? Down to the hold! The propulsion's out of order. I'll try to fix it. You're insane! Stop! Stay back, Gramps! I heard everything! No lizard's taking me prisoner! This contraption's going down! Right now! Music... One of the rare pleasures created by humans. So, Fleming? You're very tense. Too much stress. You need a vacation. Rodrigue, we got control of the Airocopter. Congratulations, my love. And? We lost contact. It crashed on the base. Remarkable! Our fugitives must love the outcome of your methods. Letting them come alone was stupid! April could be in pieces now! Don't be childish. To be useful, we must search the jungle. Pops? Pops? Pops? Where are we? Come now, Pizoni, be brave! I did it, and I could be your father! I don't care, I'm not moving! Hurry up, I've got a granddaughter to find. Why don't these trees have stairs? Pizoni, close your eyes and just slide down this lovely vine. So this is what those lizards want? But why? They're dragons. So beautiful, all these trees... All these plants... All this clean air... Do you hate me? What do you want me to do? Say we're meant for each other? Kiss and make up? Yeah! Julius, you're the love of my life! So what if you sold Pops to the cops and lied to me! If they hadn't nabbed Pops we wouldn't be here! Thanks to me you might find your parents! I went looking for them and ended up with you. Is that it? Are you through? What do we do now? How do I know? Go sniff ahead, see what you find. I gotta take all the risks? Brilliant! Go sniff ahead yourself. Darwin, don't be upset. Come back. I have a little private need to attend to. For a cop, I'm behind bars a lot. Incredible! Do you like your enclosure? It wasn't me! He wrecked your machine! Let me out, I'll work for you. Discipline is my middle name! Where's April? I wish I knew. Me, too. I'm sure you're lying. Rodrigue, stop playing the cruel male. They don't know. The children found part of the Airocopter, and footprints. We must keep searching. See that? I nearly tricked him. He almost set us free. Dad? Paul? Smells buonissimo! Can I try it? If you like. It's cockroach pâté. Grazié mille, ma I'd hate to deprive you of your protein. Sure you don't want any? My friend, I have work to do. I thought those scientists were prisoners? I'm sick of Schumann. Couldn't they play some Verdi? How's tricks? Tell me, dear colleague, have you seen Annette and Paul Franklin? Scusi, ma... Who are you? Where are the Franklins? You don't know who you are? Why are you looking for Mr. Franklin? That traitor! Who are you? Security! We've got spies! No, not here! I forgot to save my file! Activate the emergency generators. It takes time. Go check the power plant. Night falls fast around here. - Dad? - Paul! Now what do we do? We must find April! Where's Annette? Don't worry about her. Hey, tadpole! Here, boy! Heel! No, mercy! I'm afraid of heights! Where are the Franklins? The female, I don't know. The male is locked up! Dad, imprisoned? Where? The cellular zone. Follow the blue lights. I've had it with these dang vines! Where are we going? To find my daughter. I think I know where she is. I'm over your family. I just want out of here. Where's the blasted exit? Bloody vegetation! We should survive without his abilities. Right. The surveillance system is disabled. You can go out the chimney. The chimney? Dad? 521 here. I'll pass you 238. We just found him. What happened, 238? Was it April and her gang? Yes. They're headed for the cells. Looking for Paul Franklin. They got my ray lance. Sorry, Dad. They're here. We've got them. Capture is near... But delicate. We must avoid a shootout. Chimène, I just got an idea. A pacifist idea. It will be to your liking. Paul! Paul, slow down. I'm not 60 anymore. Where are we going? April doesn't know this jungle. She's surely been captured. I know where they'll take her. What's she look like now? Follow the blue lights! Piece of cake. Too easy for this one! This one wanted to blend into the scenery like an animal! This one didn't want to be seen! So this one got us lost! Fight quietly, please. You can be heard for miles. Mom? April! Mom! Mom, look! It's Darwin. And that's... Julius. We'll get acquainted later. We can't stay here. So, you escaped? Were you in prison, like Dad? Know how to get him out? I'll explain everything. Beautiful, isn't it? A technological paradise. A paradise with prisoners. Where's Dad? Here, the world's smartest people work with animals. Dragons and scientists, working together for the Project. What do you mean? What project? Anything to do with the serum? Why aren't you in prison like Dad? Hang on. Welcome, little female! You lied to me. You betrayed us! I did neither. You're here for the greatest cause. Excellent work, thanks. The Franklins' little runt. What a pleasure, knowing this family for so long... Not! Here's your serum. That's what you want. It's yours! Give me back my dad and let us go. Idiot! We don't want that stupid ball, we want your mind! We want the formula you worked so hard to find. It saved your cat. The real Ultimate Serum. What are you on about? My cat was saved by my parents' serum, in the ball. My formula never worked. April, the serum we left you 10 years ago was ineffective. We recreated it here, and it failed. 329! I'm 156, Mom! This is Spy 217. We sent him to your laboratory. Two drops of your serum revived him after he met your cat. Like Darwin, the rodent mutated. He can regenerate, survive any attack. Hear that? I'm a cat-warrior! I'm kittenvincible! How could I have done that in my crummy lab? Murderer! Psychopath! Shut up! And watch... Kittenvincible! That really wasn't necessary. You will recreate the Ultimate Serum here, for the Project. The Project? The emergency generators are working! Activate! This is a rocket. It'll explode way out in space. Scattering the leaves and vines, spreading billions of spores from our jungle. These organisms, treated with your formula, will survive the explosion and interstellar space. They'll live and multiply on new planets. April, thanks to your discovery, life will never die! The rocket vegetation awaits your serum. "Project Second Life" is finally happening! Hang on... You're gonna blow up a giant bomb to save life? All this science for that? April, your ancestor, Gustave, showed us how you humans use science. You'll end up destroying everything. Using your science to preserve life is our only hope. Far from humans, nature could survive. Some pacifists you are! You kidnapped my parents and blew up a cable car, killing everyone! That was an accident. Nothing compared to your wars. If you refuse to help us, though it repels me, Rodrigue will have to deal with your mother. Sorry, Annette. But we have to save nature. Where's your lab? Need a hand? Pass me the catalyst. That liquid there. Should you give your serum to those lizards? Julius, it's water. There, done. Let's test it. 132! Hold it. The Ultimate Serum! You did it! The vial! You're welcome. Final phase! Injecting the serum into the rocket vines! Checking guidance. Firing the engines. Clearing the launch pad! Rodrigue, will you give me the serum? Rodrigue! The serum is for the rocket only! Korolev! Fire the engines! Blastoff time! The serum hasn't been injected! Verifications are not finished... I handled it. Prepare for blastoff if you want to keep your legs. How great it feels to be invincible! Chimène! I adjusted the bomb's altimeter. The rocket will explode at 500 meters. All earthly life will be destroyed! Firing the engines! Phase 1... Humans will meet the fate they deserve. We'll dance on their ashes! We, the dragons, will reign to the end of time, invincible, immune to sickness and death! Chimène, we will protect life, the lives of the deserving, our lives! Let's drink the serum! Never! I can't let you commit such an abomination! Chimène... My Chimène... I can no longer bear your orders. I am appalled at how you treat this human trash. We no longer see eye to eye. It's time for us to part! And I'll take the children! Children! Make up your minds. Live and reign with Dad, or die with Mom? Leave her alone! Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad! Firing the engines, phase 2... The dragons have gone bananas! To the monorail, quick! Doctors first! Make room! Wait for me! Julius! Julius! Mom! The Project... Our lives... All a failure. April, if you only knew how sorry I am... We must find Chimène. Only she can prevent the disaster. I can't leave you. Go. I'll manage. April. Chimène! Listen to me. We have one last chance. The altimeter. Go in the rocket and adjust the bomb's altimeter. So it'll explode in space. Chimène, April. Thanks again for everything. Yoo-hoo, lizard! Idiot! I'm invincible! That's right, tadpole! Here's the serum! I gave you water! Rodrigue, king of the universe, you drank good old H2O! Lift-off in three minutes. Evacuate the launch pad, please. Come on! To the rocket! The rocket? Are you crazy? April, wait! Hey! Lift-off in two minutes. Attention, doors sealing. Darwin! Darwin! Too late! Firing the engines, phase 3. April! Dad! Come on, hurry! April, what're you doing? What? - Where are we? - No time to explain. Go! Keep going! This way! Hurry, as far away as possible! TOILET IMPERIAL Get in! The bomb's going to explode! We have to try to get as far away as possible! Unless Darwin succeeds! What do you mean? What have we done? Science will know sin. Big time! Lousy rotten chimney! September 16, 1941. To thank him for his invaluable services to the Empire, Napoleon V has named the fearless Pizoni Head of Secret Services. Beware, criminals! Pizoni will smoke you out and punish you, as he single-handedly liquidated the villains who terrorized our civilization! July 20, 1951. Thanks to clean and limitless oil, the energy wars are over. Despite working with the best scientists, April Franklin has still not succeeded. Our biologist hasn't yet managed to make her Ultimate Serum compatible with the human organism. The Eiffel Tower destroyers' dastardly scheme seems to be working. Vegetal life is flourishing on the Moon, Mars and Venus. July 21, 2001. One small step for me, but one giant leap for the Democratic Union. I'm walking on the Moon! My detectors indicate a safe atmosphere. Something's moving... I'm not alone! What took you so long, lazybones? April, I'm coming! April! They found Darwin! On the Moon! April? April! You scared the life out of me! Have a drink. It's no serum, but it'll give you a lift. The End
