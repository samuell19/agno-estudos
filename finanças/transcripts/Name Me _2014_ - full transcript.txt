Igor Tolstounov's Production Company "PROFIT" "Financially Supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation" Igor Tolstounov's Production Company Droog Drooga Film Company Four... "Financially Supported by the Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation" You're welcome... A Film by Nigina Sayfullaeva Have a nice stay. Four grivnas? How much is that in roubles? Do you accept rubles? 1 for 5. That's the real rate? Take it or leave it, girls. So it's like 20 rubles... That's OK. We'll take two. No, make it three. - Anyway, make it for a hundred. - A hundred... Here's the fourth... Mmm sour! Feels so weird in my mouth... inside my mouth... Here's 30... Ok, thank you. Could you tell us where Primorskaya Street is? Primorskaya, number 12. Go to the right, along the fences, and the barns and you're there. Barns, barns, barns...! Yeah, there are plenty of them. Number 12, Check those shorts out! Shush. Come here. My god, he's so creepy! He's kinda cool. I like him! I think he's an alcoholic! Olya, what's wrong? Nothing. Can't you just take it easy? I... I can't. I don't know what to do, what to say, how to communicate with him! How about you just walk in and say "Hi, I'm Olya." It'll be easy from there. It's always so easy for you! And so complicated for you. Screw it. I'm not going. And where are you going? Home. And what'll you tell your mom? There we go again. Running away as usual! We traveled all the way to Crimea just to take a look through the fence? OK. Watch and learn! You approach him like a real sex bomb and say: "Hey there... I'm Olya..." That's more like I would do... Ah, anyway... Just walk in and say: "Hi. I'm Olya." WHAT IS MY NAME C'mon, ring the bell. Knock! No rooms available. Try house #16. Hi, I'm Olya! Ah, Olya. Cool, you actually remember my name. Dad... Can I call you that? And this is my friend Sasha. Well, come in then. - How about taking our bags? - Asshole. Who's up for a swim? Don't swim here. Just go somewhere else. What? Why is that? Actually no, the other room. Get comfy. Any other food besides crackers? Take a look in the fridge. Does your mother know you're here? Of course she does. Anyone? So how is she? Fine. Got married. And you? You live alone? A man has to live alone. What about women? You'd better ask a woman. I don't know. So you always lived here in Alupka? All alone? For 42 years. So you're 42? 41. And you got mom... You got mom pregnant when you were 25? Something like that. Cool. Any walkabouts here in Alupka? You can walk wherever you want. You can walk the whole town in 3 hours. But you probably have a favorite place or something? What place? A place you like to go to... He's so funny! I don't think he's funny at all! He's just shy! What? He doesn't give a damn about us! Surely, it's not a very warm welcome. But he's wild. He's not wild, he's rude. And neglected. Yeah, bad news about your daddy! I'll fix him up! I'm going. Lock the door if you leave. - You're going downtown? - Where? - The city center? - Yes. We'll come with you. You'll show us around. Just let us change. Sexy... Sasha, it's not polite to go through other people's stuff. Why not? This is your family heritage! That's him! This one, right? There he is. He's a cutie. Yuck! Sasha! How much longer? Just a moment! We're ready. Slow down, we can't go this fast! And I chafed my foot. My thumb and my pinky! You should've told me earlier, I could've given you a band-aid. Damn. Total fail. Hey let's go by car! What car? It's a 10-minute walk. - But she chafed her foot! - Yeah, it really hurts! We take the car or you gonna carry me all the way! - Have you been to Vorontsovsky Palace? - What? It's a landmark here. Just like the Kremlin in Moscow. Like a museum? I don't dig museums. We're more into nightclubs and such. We do have some clubs here, but not like in Moscow. - More like Alupka clubs? - Yep. Turn the music off! Pick us up tomorrow. 12, Primorskaya st. Right where you've picked us up, not far away. You're dad won't kick my ass? He's not my dad! Even worse. So... See you tomorrow? Hold on. Give me your phone number. Can I have one too? And a lighter. Does Olya smoke too? Kind of. More just for fun. Not regularly. How long have you smoked for? Since the fifth grade. Is she always like that? Yeah. That's just the kind of person she is... She can't really control it. That's enough! See you tomorrow then! Let's grab some food! - I've got business to do. - That can wait. - Food first, business later. - I demand a family dinner! Damn. You should've ordered more! Look at your figure! You need to grow it out a bit! My figure is just fine... Unlike your figures of speech! Is Crimean beer any good? Yuck. Did you have to come with a friend? Would you prefer Ma and Grandma? So your mom is doing just fine? Couldn't be better, as I said. She's got a cool husband, Anatoly. A cool job. And a cool daughter. I am cool, right? Seems like it. How would you know? You know nothing about me! So tell me. I don't even know where to start! Well, do you go to school or something? Nope. I was suspended for misbehavior. Joking! I graduated 2 months ago. I'm 17 years old, by the way. Almost 18. You probably didn't even know that, eh? Your dessert. So you've finished school... What's next? I failed exams for uni... for journalism school... ...for acting school. But who cares. Sasha is quite the opposite! Sasha's a good girl. She got into Higher School of Economics! - Ever heard of it? - Nope. It's the real deal. Highly prestigious. Right. I got to go. We'll talk later. I'll be there soon. And who exactly will pay for us? Damn, I forgot my razor. Can I use yours tomorrow? No. And you'll stay hairy. That's not an option. Cause, perhaps... Kirill... So you like him? Who knows? We'll see. And what about... Pasha? Pasha was his name, right? The one that hit on you at "Caramba". Did you give him your number? Marvelous! He's a jerk! Come on... Sasha. - No one is ever good enough for you. - Ha-ha! This is so damn funny, Olya! I just can't stop laughing! - What's that? - It's the dog again. Stupid thing. What the hell! He's not texting me! I don't like it here. We haven't even been anywhere yet. But tomorrow... I mean in this home! I don't like that we're staying here with him. What's the big deal? It looks like he's out most of the time. And that stupid idea to switch names... - I told you it was stupid right away. - Every time he... Every time he calls you "Olya" it freaks me out! I don't know... Go ahead and tell him... We were joking! Actually, I'm your daughter. Damn... What? If you really want to get to know him as a father... You know, parent-child relationship and all that... Let's tell him the truth! We'll sort this out somehow. He won't kick us out! It's even better for me. I'll hook up with him! Don't even joke about that! Why not? It's just... My instincts as a daughter are somehow suppressed. I don't like him at all. I mean... I'm afraid of him. That's why... I mean... That's why I'm uncomfortable here. What did you expect back then in Moscow? That it'd all be perfect? I just wanted to see him. To see what he's like. If we're alike or not. And you... Did you... Ever want to see your father? Not anymore. Is that him? It's a girl! So he's got a girlfriend? Didn't he say he lives alone? He could be running a brothel here... See you later. Missed me? Did you miss me sweetie? You did. Good girl. How much longer? About 15 minutes! Are you insane? Cool, huh? You actually dyed them? You want too? No! It must be Kirill. Check this out! He's on a scooter! Let's have some fun. Let me do it. Let me. Well? I want a picture too! Kirill, hug Sasha. OK, Sasha... Look at the mountains! One sec. Mommy! Hello? Damn. I can't hear anything. Use the landline. Come here. Dear guests of the Ai-Petri Mountain we welcome you... - How much is it? - 50 grivnas. Just don't buy anything here! You hear me? - Why? - Come on, let's go. How much was that? 50 grivnas. I'll make you a dozen of these for 50 grivnas! Dear guests of the Ai-Petri Mountain! Join the tour to see the plateau. The Three-Eyed Cave and get to the deepest part of it. And climb to the very top of the "Teeth" peaks at 1200 meters... Kirill, I want to go to the caves. Or the "Teeth" peaks. In a bit. Without guides, we'll go by ourselves for free. Good day, sir! Good day. So, you prefer the caves or the "Teeth" peaks? The Caves. Or the peaks... Whatever. Can you believe it! The horse's name is Capricot. Like Capricorn, but with a "T". Totally unbelievable. Get off, will you? Easy rider... Come on! Goodbye! I don't know... Let's just stay here for the night... Up until sunrise. Could be so cool! Kind of. But I feel like partying. Hey, let's go to Alushta! A film festival takes place there. First they watch the movies and then get drunk on a boat. - Yeah! Let's get drunk on a boat! - Yeah! Come on! Who's gonna let us in? They're having a banquet and we're like "Hi we're here!" Know what? We'll say Olya's an actress! You do look like an actress, you know? I say no! What the hell? - You're such a tight-ass. - Sasha, what's wrong? My name is Olya, just for the record! Here we go again... I'm off. Olya, wait up! Sasha, what the hell was that? Olya! Please, wait, Olya! Olya, wait! Another unauthorized fishing case has been filed in Balaklava Bay. A 55 year old man from Alupka has been detained... The poaching damages are estimated at 16000 grivnas. Soon he will be prosecuted according to the local laws. Stay tuned for culture news update. - So I'm an actress. And you? - I'm a director! - A director? - Yeah. And which movie have I starred in? Mmmm "Biker Babes!" Sweetsy, come here... Neat, huh? Look what I've got! Are you OK? What the... Hey, what the hell? Fuck. Goddamn it! Hello. Do you want soup? Probably. - Is that a yes? - Mhhm... Do you have anything to say at all? As if nothing happened, eh? Absolutely nothing. What nothing? Bon appetit. Your puke is all over the bath! Out all night... You should act more like your friend. I cleaned it up. Relax. I forgot to cut the bread. Hold it there. Cut the bread. You hear me, Olya? Why not leave it to my exemplary friend? Cut the bread. Well? Has it occurred to you, dad, that your daughter could have been in trouble last night? That all this was a result of a trouble? And puke is just a result of trouble? Hello boys and girls! Girls, I'm Sveta, and you? Olya and Sasha. Olya and Sasha. Have some apples! So Olya and Sasha, you arrived yesterday? Have you been to the Vorontsovsky Palace yet? Girls, it's just unbelievable. They've got... How do you say... Antique tiling and stuff... And the interiors... My God! Everything is so posh... I wish I could just stay and live there! So what stopped you? You can't! You may not touch anything in there! The chairs, the beds... It's all antique and fragile! But the antiquities are mind-blowing! I get goosebumps looking at it! So you're into antiquities, Sveta? What do you mean? Well... You like old stuff... Not just old stuff... You've got a vintage dress... - And you yourself... - Enough! Stop clowning around! Who's clowning, daddy? Is this your daughter? So big! Wow! Who wants tea? Thank you, Sasha. I'll pass. Is Sasha your daughter too? No, thank God. One is just more than enough. Alrighty then. Enough chitchat. I'll be going. Otherwise I'll get caught in those nasty ultraviolet rays. Olya, Sasha, do you go to the beach? - Do you? - I can show you a place. You can have the whole beach for yourself! Have some apples! Who is Sveta anyway? She rents a room. She's from Novy Urengoy on vacation. Any more questions? Novy Urengoy... Definitely looks like it. OK. I'm going. Otherwise I'll get caught in those nasty ultraviolet rays. - You coming? - Sit. What? No one's going anywhere! We're having a family gathering. Oh really? Yes. Hair of the dog? No, thanks. Family gathering, get it? What was it you said on the phone? I want to meet you, to know you better... Fine. Here I am. - What's taking you so long? - There's nothing there, damn it! - Look closer, it's there for sure! - I bet Sveta ate it all! Alright, I'll take a look by myself. Come on, Dad! I've got you! Led Zeppelin broke up in 1980 cause John Bonham died. AC/DC's first lead singer Bon Scott also died in 1980. When he was still alive he knew AC/DC lead singer Brian Johnson. So he said: "If I die this dude should take my place". Fill it! Wow... Impressive! Jeez! Why so little? Why, you little drunkard! Here's more. Let's pretend we are in a TV show and you're super famous. And thousands, millions of people want to hear your life story! Well? Nah... I say we just have more drinks. Dare what? Damn, dad. Truth or Dare, it's a game! Well, you... Either answer a question... Sincerely! Or, if you refuse, you do as we wish. So... She asks a question... And if I refuse to answer she does what I say? Shit, Dad, you're so hard! Unlike you! Keep shaking your ass from here to there... Cut the bullshit, Dad! - Come on, Truth or Dare? - Well? Truth or Dare? Truth! I always stand for truth... Then tell me... What? Where... Where did you lose your virginity? Sheesh! Well, when I was 18. Why so late? Girls were chaste. And not like you nowadays. What are we like? Fucking with everyone just because you've got the looks! And that is all you consider! Whether or not you can fuck this one or that one. Did you... Love Olya's mother? Love whom? I mean... Katya. - My mother, that's who! - Ah... Katya. Mother... Damn. I had no idea she was your mother, Olya. I didn't even know she was... ...anything but a pair of legs and an ass... and waves in the sea... I saw her lying there on the beach... And my girlfriend, Anya, she just dumped me and went jumping from one bed to another. So she's lying there. And I say: "What's your name?" "Katya." And I think: "Why would she lie there all by herself?". - "I better get down there and..." - Enough! Enough I said! Well... Right. Enough is enough. Enough with this fucking interview... These dares... So let's say it was just a holiday fling. Just a... ...a shag on the beach. But since Katya so unfortunately got pregnant... Have you... Ever thought about how your daughter is growing up there in Moscow? What she's like? Does she look like you? Why didn't you take part at all? You better ask mother Katya about it! She gave birth there in Moscow with her lover-boy! And just sent me a telegram after: "We'll handle it ourselves here!" What lover-boy? "Don't bug us!" She was with no one! She got married only afterwards! Yeah, right! All so lonely in Moscow! Not a single man there! A fucking desert! Enough! We're not done yet! It could be that I'm just stupid And everyone dumps me... Katya... Anya... But I don't give a shit. I used to be a lifeguard... I saved all those people and you know what? They just left... And I don't give two shits about their gratitude! And now what? A daughter pops out! Out of nowhere! With a fiancé... What fiancé? Kirill? Yes! Alupka is not the place to come looking for a fiancé! Let's go home! Asshole! What? Wait, let's... Let's play just one last time and then we all go to bed. OK? - Truth or dare? - Alright. Dare me! Great... Dance with me! OK, let's dance. What the fuck? Dad... It hurts! Move, your ass! Get out of here! I'll show you some upbringing! Let us go! Come on! Get in! Take a rest! Hey! Open the door! Open it! Fuck! What's with you? You're drunk! What, right here? Sergey! Fucking hell! That bastard! Piece of shit. Why the hell did you tease with him? He got mad because you were teasing him! Cause I'm stupid. I had a little too much yesterday... What, is he an alcoholic? Maybe he's delirious? My God, what a nightmare! Stop saying God. - We're not in a church here. - Idiot! - That idiot is your father. - He isn't my father. He is... He's no father at all! That's not how a father behaves! Anatoly, my stepdad, is much more of a father than he is. Though not my kin. I think dads behave in different ways. Also like that. How would you know? You never had a dad! Not even a stepdad! And you never had a brain! Sasha... I'm sorry but... It's just that... You really don't know what it's like... In a family. With two parents... What it's like between them and a child. And you are such an expert! Your stepdad, Anatoly, he's really something! He's a total deadbeat! He's normal! - He's a loser, you said it yourself! - I did not say that! So where will you go now? Home. Back to Moscow. Our tickets are for the 25th! - OK! So we can change the date then! - So you'll return the tickets. Then what? Have you forgot... When you return a ticket you loose some of the money. So you won't have enough for a new one. And what exactly do you suggest? Where should we go then? - Nowhere. We'll just stay here. - I'm not staying here with him! I'm telling you, he'll behave! He's really upset about yesterday! Look at him! He's so ashamed! We'll stay and... We'll behave... We'll behave ourselves right. Sit! Good girl. Atta girl. Where are you heading? To party and booze! Give me a smoke. We gonna keep this going forever? "I admit that I was wrong. Wild, drunken, uncontrolled." "As a penalty I'm ready to become completely bold." Why is it forbidden to swim here? Where? Near the house. You said so. No reason... Just... There's a boat depot - that's all. So basically we can swim here, right? Sure, go ahead. - Come on, let's go together. - Me? Nah, I can't. I'm too old! If I drown you'd be responsible. You won't drown! Cause you're a... Cause I'm a piece of shit? Shit always floats, eh? Silly! You're not a piece of shit! You're a lifeguard. Or you just made up that story? Go swim. Come on! Please! Swim yourself, I'm not going. - OK, I'm going. - Good. Oh! Did I hit you hard? You have claws or something? Claws? Perfectly pedicured nails! Pedicured? My face is now all pedicured! Get a load of this! I broke my nail on you! Quiet! Don't you recognize me? Bitch. Hey. Where to? Can't I take a leak? Do it fast, we must go. Damn, I need a piss! Hold it, just don't wet your pants here! - Quiet! People are sleeping! - What people? At your place? It's not that simple! He paid off the guy! But turns out it was the wrong guy and now he's totally screwed! 14 grand! I wonder how many years he'll get for 14 grand, ha? I don't really care. I just care about our business going smooth. Man, we're not... as insolent as Gennady. Compared to him we're just kiddies! Small amounts... And my wife today she was all like "Don't go! Don't go!" She saw Gennady in the news and turned yellow! Do you have anything to drink here? Ivan's bottle should be in the back. Take a look. What's that? Who the fuck are you? - Hi, dad. - I'm nobody's dad! Dad, tell Pete that I'm your daughter and it's all fine. Cause he's kinda aggressive. Man, she's your daughter? Make a u-turn! The fuck for? - Back to Alupka! - Am no taxi service! It's an hour each way! We ain't got time! - He's right, let's do business. - Shut up! Got that? So we take her with us? That's your call, pops... Why bother? Just take me with you. Well, baby-girl, how should I put it... We're running a certain business here! What have I done to deserve you? We'll have a word back home. What's so funny again? Better watch her, man! You'd be surprised how helpful I can be! Here, dad, you were for water. You see? Man, tell me the truth... got any little ones back there, or is that it? Maybe sonny-boy is hiding in the trunk? Watch the road! Thank you. Take the flashlight. There they are. Load it. Hello there, Krylov! Hi, I'm Olya! - Who's that? - Sergey's daughter. You take your son along fishing. Sergey takes his daughter! What kind of fishing is this? Krylov, chill out! You'll have to clean up if she screws up! Got that? Stay here with Dima. And be quiet. And don't go anywhere. Got it? What, she didn't say anything? Good evening! She said nothing. Just left! And that prick too. What prick? Daddy. Sergey. Hold on. She's got a thing for that guy? I have no idea. Let's go! Where exactly? I don't know... Take me wherever you... let shit off the hook. You think that's where they are? I think nothing at all! Just take me where people dance, get drunk and wasted. Right now! - Can we get going or what? - Okay boss. Is it OK they're not back yet? Chill out. They'll pull the nets and return. What if they've drowned? Yeah! Or maybe a shark ate them up! Here. - So you're not from Alupka, huh? - I live in Moscow. No shit! What, you thought nobody lives in Moscow? - Are we expecting anyone? - Shit! - Wait! Don't do anything! - You have a phone? - Do you have my dad's number? How do I find it? - Look for Serge! Dad, there's a car here! Don't land back here! - What the hell? - Fisheries enforcement! You're enforcing fish? That's great. - What has it to do with us? - Just checking. Could you turn around, I'm not exactly clothed. Having fun, eh? Trying to. Whose car is that in the woods? Yours? Let's check it out. Move it! He says: "Where's the boat?" I say: "Shit!" And Dima just pops his eyes out like and says: "What boat?" Look at her! When they searched the car I crapped my pants cause I'm not in the papers and they'd know it's Pete's car. Enough munching! Before you know it they'll come back and take us with all the fish. Where will you put all that fish? It won't fit in a fridge! So many boxes! That's a secret! It's pretty. Is it a flounder? It looks sad... Yeah, not exactly the happiest day for it... Sergey, did I tell you you've got one hell of a daughter? I'm totally aware of it. A fine bride for Dima! - He's completely in love already. - Why a bride? - Why not? - You've already had your wedding night. - Yeah, right. So you've fiddled her for free, eh? I didn't fiddle anyone! I was just... Well, go get some rest. Daughter. Hello? Hello. Hello? Who is it? This is... It's Sasha. Hello? Olya's Sasha? Sasha's Olya. Olya's Sasha. Sasha's Alina! Wait, where are you? Come over and get me out of here. From where? Speak clearly. Isn't it clear enough? Come here and take me home! Are you drunk? I had a drink or two with Kirill. So what? Then Kirill is the one to take you home. Got it? Listen... Come over and take me home! It's your duty! What the hell do you think? Traitor. Can you hear me? I don't understand you at all. I'll wake up Olya and you can talk to your friend. Got it? Go on! Wake my friend up! But get it, she's Sasha. I'm Olya. You're talking to your daughter Olya right now! I don't get it. What is it you don't get? What? It was all a lie! We lied about our names! It's all a lie! We just switched! Just switched. And you believed it! You hear me? It was my mother Katya you've fucked! Katya is my mother! Sasha's mother is called Lena! Get up. What is it, dad? What's your name? What do you mean? What do I mean? I mean your name. The one in your ID. Don't! Please, forgive me! Please, forgive! Dad... I never want to see either of you two here ever again! Tell me the truth! Was it you? You told him? Get your hands off me! Yes it was me. I called and told him. So what? And why exactly should I discuss my decisions with you? It's all over now. Why... Sweetsy, please, forgive me. I didn't mean to! Jesus! Would you shut up! He kicked us out, huh? Then let's just all go to my place? You can leave all your stuff there. It'll be alright. I'm not going anywhere. You'll stay right here? Come on, sweetsy. It'll be just like in Moscow! You'll like it! I've been wondering, where did you get that word from? What word? "Sweetsy". You made it up or heard somewhere? Well, it means "sweet" and... "Pretty". It's a shit of a word. Kirill, I'm coming with you. Sasha, please listen. We're now going to Kirill's place. Are you coming with us? Kirill! What? What? Stay here. I'll be quick. My white sandals. Where are they? No idea. My God. You're such a loser! Complete loser! Not words I usually use, but... They just describe you the best. Loser. Shithead. Bum. Who are you talking to? I'm talking to a shithead! Or what do you want me to say? Father? That'd be a lie. My father lives in Moscow. His name is Anatoly. Katya's husband. Yes. The man my mother chose to live with. A serious and prosperous man. Civilized! Civility! Do you know what that means? It's when children are taught from a very young age what is meant by "mother" and "father"! Yeah... It's a good thing I came out here. Cause now I can clearly see... It'd be so ridiculous for her... to be with you... Not even an option. What're you looking at? Am I wrong? Olya, I'm very happy that you love your stepdad. Honestly, I am. My mother is an incredible woman! She's beautiful and intellectual! I'm very glad to hear that too. Listen. Just listen. I'm not some brute! Might not be an intellectual, but... Here's what I think, Sergey! It's very good that you don't have other children... And won't have any. At least I really hope so. You have no business... Breeding! Hi Sergey. Hi. - Did you sell it? - Yep. Good. Listen, I just wanted to ask... Will she keep quiet? - Your daughter. - She will... I just buried her in the backyard. Good thinking! But seriously. She won't tell anyone? Cut it out! She's in Moscow already! Alright. See you. Maybe you should try the doghouse? Now get up and get out! I said get out! Sergey? Could you give me some more mosquito repellent? Bon Appetit! I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to girls! Missed everything as usual. Here. I'll be leaving soon too. Two days after tomorrow. Those two weeks just went right by... And the mosquitos? The last couple of days they're just monsters! Maybe the weather is changing... It seems they are really attracted to me. Perhaps I have their favourite blood type... That means you're in good health then! And the funny thing is... I once applied for a job on a ship. They told me they're selectively looking for healthy people and they check: you know, gynecology, legs, heart and all that stuff! Then, after all the tests they said I'm healthy to go to outer space! "Ma'am, you are perfectly healthy, come right in!" Do you have any kids? No. Why? Just thought you do. I'm just morally ready for it. Very much ready... And when I was 25 I said to myself: "If I don't find a man before I'm 30 I'll just make a kid for myself". A man's not important for me. I was raised without a father. So it's not that critical to me, you know. I only need to get pregnant. I'll just handle it from there. Want some fish? Sorry I didn't offer you right away. Oh, no, thanks. I don't eat at night! Well, good night then. This isn't the last repellent is it? - Sure you don't need it? - Absolutely. Get that faggot! What's with you? Motherfucker! Don't touch him! He's my father! Get out of here! Stupid bitch. What the fuck? Do you have any brains at all? - Don't yell at me, dad. - I'm not your dad! Are you out of your mind? What kind of a person are you? How the hell were you brought up to be like this? I was brought up like that because you weren't there. You were somewhere else! I love you. You love me? Yeah? Is this how you love me? Is it? - Like this? - Let me go! Sergey? Sergey! Sergey, how could you? What did you do? She's just a child! It's just a tough age! Calm down. Why are you just sitting there? The girl's gone nuts because of you! You know what? It's all bullshit! My grandma once went nuts too... She was like... "My heart aches. Ooh, my heart! I can't hold it any longer!" And my mom says: "Know what we'll do, Sveta?" "We'll hypnotize her to think she's fine!"
