A PRAYER FOR KATARINA HOROVITZOVA In 1943, six Americans of Jewish descent on an ill timed visit to Europe were captured by the Germans in Italy. According to Herr Brenske we are now under police protection. He assured me that the exchange will be carried out in a courteous fashion and that he detests any form of violence He has promised to come here. He thinks that we should arrive at the place to be reached before nightfall, decently dressed Decently dressed. By Hitler? Won't he steal our last pair of pants? I was just quoting his words. Attention! At ease! I'm glad, gentlemen to see you in such good humour. In your situation, you'll have to try to keep your spirits up. Sit down, please. It's still far from nightfall and I don't wish you to be... Fatigued. Please sit down. I'd... rather stand! Let's go to the merit. Well, you know gentlemen... that after the treason of July 1943... we had to occupy Italy. This has brought that country under our jurisdiction. And that unfortunately Gentlemen, means you. We have a law from which, as you see... you are not exempt. Everyone is equal in front of the law. Yet, for an elite like you, gentlemen... a loophole could be found. You are of special value. We too have officers on the other side They are not very well off however and there are expenses connected with their exchange. Our party proposes therefore to exchange you for a corresponding number of our officers... provided you bear all the expenses. An exchange dictated by necessity nevertheless, an exchange, gentlemen. You are anxious to have them back. and we are to pay the costs. I have to implement the exchange... and I can't say what the total costs will amount to. Inclusive of course of board and lodging, care for you... security. Plus 500,000 Swiss francs per head. which sum hasn't been fixed by ourselves but by the American party. Paying both parties means A million francs each. Total wars are expensive. For both sides then, as I said correctly... You are too intelligent to need any detailed explanation. It is necessary to keep separate for a certain time the moral aspects from the practical ones. That's the way to get round it. Well, it's going to cost you a relatively large sum of money. But we know you can afford it. We expect you to be reasonable. Why are we being guarded like criminals? Why have our American passports been confiscated? You'll get them back of course. When? Untouched. In due time. Anything else? Please... Why have a war if you can't afford it? You have made me laugh... in your films but here your remark sounds more inappropriate. I might get a glimpse of your sense of humour. You mentioned large sums. What if we haven't got them? Our trade department has answered your question. Have you verified it? If not... Mr. Rappaport... I see... You have a large share... in the Chicago stockyards. Should Germany lose the war would the allies take such pains with us, as we do with you? But this has to be arranged bilaterally. Your spokesman, Mr. Cohen has mentioned certain apprehensions on your part. Let's have the question of our proposal put to the vote. You have heard, gentlemen... Mr. Brenske You've made your picture and I beg you to tell us what you have decided. Mr. Varecky... Mr. Klarfeld... Mr. Taubenstock... Mr. Lowenstein... Are we in the senate, gentlemen? Are we in parliament? I'm glad... that you've taken your choice voluntarily. The transfer of funds can be effected through your Swiss banks. The basic payment can be effected individually. for the additional expenses and transportation. You'd better assign a proxy. Thank you, gentlemen. What does it mean, Nightfall? Don't we have watches? I have to get you to a safe place. and I want to reach it before nightfall. No! No! No! What's up? I don?t want to... What's this, please? A disturbance of some sort. - I'm sorry. - I don't want to die. May I ask please... Can this woman join our party. We want a certain number of Generals Didn't you offer us your help? You would have to bear the entire costs. I'll do that. Attention! Well, gentlemen... We shall see. Take your choice. Please. Di... or Paris. You can try on your undies in there. Don't be afraid... little one. I'm Dayem, a rabbi from Lodz. Master of the hair-drying room. Oh my beautiful one. Ashes... After fire. Our nostrils full of ashes Like my eyes. Can you smell... Ashes? I don't understand. I am master In the hair drying room. Where all meet again. I survived... to sing for them. But they have American papers. Papers also burn. Oh my beautiful... foolish one. My tender... and trusting one. Could I ask you for something? To command! Will you give that suitcase to my mother? A nasty wind in these Polish plains as if coming from the mountains. yet they are so far away. Wind? Yes, the wind. - You've done a good job. - Yes, Sir. Change in there. A nasty wind, indeed, I say. No, no... I won't try on the trousers. I have confidence on you. Well, let's see. A good fit. In the U.S.A. you'd find a good job. I used to know an excellent Warsaw tailor. He went away in time, to Paris. and later to London. One such tailor ended his journey in Gdansk. Something was wrong with his nose. May I leave my old suit here? - Thank you. - A good job. It's something. A thing I'm always glad to see. I hope you understand. We did our best, Sir. but our feeble powers. I'll never forget... I know just ashes. What's that? In my eyes... all is ashes... Ashes. We like to remember a man's talents. Get out! A French author once wrote that dresses... bring women to perfection. War or no war... People will be people. This brings us closer together. Though divided by a fence. It helps to alleviate things that have been imposed on us. Have you got the cheque for your maintenance so we can start on our journey? Alright. Unsigned. May I ask why? We think further payment should be made when we are aboard ship. You mean F.O.B.? Are our Generals marketable goods? More respect, if you please. We are entitled to the same measure of consideration. Agreed. The American party is demanding a guarantee. In the cables hitherto received they show no enthusiasm about the proposed exchange. Yet we want our Generals back. I can't believe the American authorities would cause any delay. You haven't been home for some time. It's easy to have an absent person written off. This is not your fault. Are you aware of what will my companions say? Aren't the prisoners of war held by the Americans of special value to you? The exchange action has met with so many difficulties that our terms, thought hard at first sight are most liberal, in fact. You want me to sign, disregarding the opinion of my companions I'm sure you know what's next door. Quickly. And there are free cots in this camp. Berlin is waiting for an answer and you have the proxy. You don't want me to look... for another six more... obliging people? Let me think it over. Right. Don't you want to say goodbye to your father and mother? May I? Let me see... How could... How could it be done? Why don't you write on the bottom of a case that you are sending your love, etc... etc... Nothing gets lost in a camp, ever. Camp means, in a sense, a climax. It's an all-inclusive meeting place. From birth on and vice versa. How have you decided? It's too much money and hardly any guarantee. Moreover you want high ranking officers in exchange for us. Nevertheless... In your case it would only be just Your luggage got lost and you've had other troubles too. I consider it my duty. Please. Thank you. A princely outfit I call it. You said we ought to hurry up. I hope we'll arrive at the port... without any mishap. Do you know which port? You'll know... by nightfall. When will we get our passports back? As soon as we are underway. Is that sufficient? Any more questions? Hasn't a delegate of the International Red Cross arrived yet? What's that? According to International law every exchange has to be attended by a delegate of the Red Cross. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. My brother holds a high office in this organization. You are too punctilious, Mr. Lowenstein. Anybody else? Please. - Hugo Varecky. - Yes, Mr. Varecky. What form of receipt do we get for the money we paid you? On an official blank of the Reichsbank. and it'll be valid to our authorities. You'll deserve well of the Reich, however odd it may sound. And after we occupy America, it will be a valuable document. Why are we being guarded? I hate to weaken one of your fronts. Your name? Freddy Klarfeld. Why worry about our fronts, Jew Klarfeld? You have too many of them. My brother opened too many branches. - and went bankrupt. - Shut up! Gentlemen... What's all this talk about gas? Attention! Heil Hitler. Sit down. Gentlemen... and Miss Horovitzova. We are starting on our way towards the exchange. And one has to realize with emotion... that it is being sponsored not only by two inimical parties... but also by the noble organization called the Red Cross. A truly wonderful organization. An example of humanity at the right place. Transmuting the divine principal into human acts of compassion. Compassion. We know what this word means to you and also for our soldiers who may be listening at this moment to the address of some officer of the Allies. Gentlemen in a port a ten hours journey from here... a beautiful ship is waiting. The name of the port is... Hamburg. And the name of the ship... Deutschland! This luxury liner of 15,000 tons displacement was the scene of a glorious event you'll find in the primers of history. From this ship, our Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler inspected the latest naval manoeuvres. However to keep to the subject. It has been made possible to let your party be joined by a woman chosen by your spokesman. chosen by your spokesman, Mr. Herman Cohen Whom I have to thank... for services hitherto rendered. When you arrive... But, I'm anticipating But I want to get it over, once and for all. Be so good as to put in a good word for this country. This war has been imposed on us. Still, all is well that ends well. Or rather... puts... an end to everything. One day the destroyed towns and burned villages will be forgotten and better ones will be built. Doesn't your example prove that co-operation can be practiced without hindrance and contradiction? and one day a still closer alliance may be forged against a common enemy. You know what I mean. You may soon witness the rarest harmony I want you to work for a mutual rapprochement. Preach the truth at your destination. I appeal to you as your friend... in the name of our unfortunate country. And as the man who has the privilege... to control your destiny. Now, Gentlemen and Miss Horovitzova let's take our seats in the carriage, travel to the port, and board the ship. Follow me, please. I'm not intruding? Not at all. Thanks. We don't seem to be stopping. We have the right of way, so to speak. I wonder where we are now. If you must know... We're in East Silesia. Herr Brenske... - Are all these guards necessary? - What do you mean? If we pledged ourselves not to try to escape. We aren't doing this for fun. The men could be used elsewhere more profitably. But we agreed to regard you as prisoners of war. There is a war. By the way, Miss Horovitzova would like to see you. Then, let her come in. Don't disturb them. What's the matter, child? I shouldn't have left them. - You needn't blame yourself. - Am I better than them? Why should I be saved. My dear... I am unable to find any words of consolation. What could I do? There's nothing wrong in what you've done. You're a kind man, Mr. Cohen. Help me to save them and I'll do anything for you. Yes... You must realize I can't do it of my own accord. It depends on Herr Brenske Herr Brenske... Would it be possible for the family of Miss Horovitzova to be set free? It's not only up to me. I'd spare no expense. I can't say how my superiors would react. It's a closed action. Please, Sir... Try... There's a certain risk, for me too. But to oblige a lady... I can send a wire with a cautious enquiry. I shall be back soon. How good of you... I have to make a confession. I wanted to save myself. That's why I pretended to be a dancer. Well... It didn't look like a lie. I learned to dance. years ago. I wanted to be a Josephine Baker. To go to France with a young man. No, don't tell me anything. I was twelve years old. He came and he saw me dancing. I performed with him once. Then father chucked him out. Don't talk about it, child. You have to know. He came and advised father... to exchange his treadle lathe for one with a motor drive. Your... father was a turner? The only one in the old town. He made chess figures too. I liked to watch him... when I was a child. You know... you still are. I'd be... so happy to have them here. Yes, yes, sure... I'd do anything for you. Never mind what will be later. We must be free first. My express cable has been answered. It can be done. See? This will just mean a cheque on your Swiss bank. The same sum as in your case. For how many persons would it be? Speak out, child. Ten, including me. You don't count. I'll be responsible for you. at the final settlement. Well? Father, mother... grandfather and my six sisters. Sonia, Ludmila, Irene, Eva, Vera and Lea. Prompt action is needed. To put her mind at rest. I understand. I've been instructed to ascertain whether the gentlemen have relatives they'd be interested in. Our small action might grow into a large one. Kindly mention it at dinner. Gentlemen... Have you considered... the proposal of Herr Breske? Have you? I've signed it. So has Mr. Lowenstein. I'll never sign. Never. How did you arrive at this decision? Gentlemen... Have you read Mein Kampf? I have. I agree, gentlemen that we ought to proceed tactically. They want something from us, we want something in return. How for example. We shouldn't be just ready to pay. But offer twice as much. Are you crazy? Provided we pay after they set us free. In the nearest of our ports. Not a bad idea. - Of course. - Count me in. Alright. I'll discuss it. Don't count on me. Our money is good money. Too good money. Yes, too good. I agree. I thought... I was dealing with men of experience. And insight. More noble minded. - If you know what I mean. - Not quite. Millions of inmates of the camps would be happy to be in your place. We'll need a hell of a lot more mutual confidence. I don't see... any reason at all... It's Miss Horovitzova. Your authorities refused to grant her a visa. I'm afraid she'll have to join the next transport. Bureaucracy, you know... being what it is. I don't understand. The apprehensions shown by your authorities are certainly most foolish. We are probably suspected of using Miss Horovitzova for some nefarious purpose. What purpose? We are victims of slander and defamation. They see German spies everywhere. This is utter nonsense. So it seems. They said it could be done if you were man and wife. They assume that you know whom you'd be marrying. You've stated that you're a widower. But... Would it be worth while? Back to the camp? You must be crazy! We can't be married anywhere else. Do they think... gentlemen, that we are mangy dogs? They could have sent a rabbi. Outside the camp, we have no rights. Do you realize what it means, to go back to that lousy camp? It's preposterous! Are we all insane or what? What gives you the right to make fools of us all? I beg your pardon. I beg your pardon? I just wanted to ask you. We are still on our way to the port. You'll have to go without me. I can't. I... can't. Tell us why you can't. Could you bear the thought... that we saved ourselves at the cost of a human life. We are doing it at the cost of many human lives. Of millions of lives. You can't pay a ransom for all of them. This is no excuse, gentlemen. This child is our responsibility. She wants to live. And also wants her parents to live. We all want to live. That's our only crime. I'm against it. Aren't you too, Mr. Taubenstock? Yes. Well, if she had a passport. We want to buy ourselves out, but at what price. Why these big words, Mr. Cohen? - I'm for the girl. - For or against? Have we all gone mad? Are you opposed to it Mr. Varecky? Come on. If I say yes... I'm against myself. If I say no... I'm against myself too. All I can do is remain.... neutral. Tell them what you think about it, Mr. Rappaport. - I? Why should I? - You should. I say yes. But that's impossible. Yes, I'm for the girl. Why? Because I don't like such bailiff types as you are Mr. Lowenstein. Secondly... Because it makes no difference. Have you lost your reason? Can't you see? No difference. With the prayer? Of course. War or no war. I can't be suspected to be submitting to racial degradation. Go ahead. Is it thou my forsaken child? Where are my parents? You promised. You said they'd be here. They're being searched for. They are probably in some disinfection room And we're in a hurry. Right? Your wedding is, after all, only a symbolic one. O my lost one I give thee the blessings of all thy kin, passing on the tidings of their sweet repose in the kingdom of heaven In forgiveness of sins, weaknesses and of all we have been unable to avoid. Eternal peace be give thee. O bride by the wisest ruler of the world... Must you... walk around in circles? That will do, I think. I must do it. I will do anything. O you trustful child. Everything in my power. O courageous one. I'll save my parents... and my sisters. Now I must begin, o unhappy one. As the stars and the moon in the sky thou the bride standest here with the bridegroom May the two live in good accord. and no contention arise between them I expected some singing. And I've traveled a long way to hear it. I am the Witness for the king of kings Guide them into eternal bliss of the envelope of these bodies Ward of the inorexable day of judgment Let brightness descend Which is as brilliant as the stars Freed from fetters May rest in peace All those marked by wounds My only one O my trustful one That's it. We're pressed for time. This isn't my only concern. I shall be praying for thee. I am the master of the hair drying room. Such fine hair... and firm Like ashes. Such fine hair. My trustful one Ashes The prayer for the dead. A lunatic I hate all rituals. There's something dark about them. coming from the middle ages. Something stultifying. Forget it. What do you believe in? Reality... Reality my dear girl. You could get things from the soldiers. Even in Warsaw. They'd sell sardines. They could be bribed, but you got only the sardines. Nothing else. And in the end it was the camp for all of us. Warsaw is far from here. Very far. I've spent my youth with them. They talked in words that were images. And he was talking in images which meant one single word. Don't say it. It doesn't exist for us. He's mad. Rest now. When you come to our country, you'll be free as before. I'll take care of you. But... you needn't feel indebted. for all this, understand. You are... very kind, but what have I done. No, it shouldn't have happened. I don't believe we'll ever get to your country. But something ought to be done about them. If not they'll do to us... whatever it may me. I hate to intrude. Did you sleep well? Those were solemn moments for both of you. One way or another. And I've... brought the receipts for all of you gentlemen. Will you present them yourself? Right. Why not. Haven't we slowed down. We have reached our destination. This is the old Hansa town, Hamburg. The Deutschland. Exactly. 15,000 tons displacement. Doesn't she look deserted? Is she under steam? Under water more like. I can see them asking for more money for coal, steam... the ship's gongs. And maybe for the wake too. To hell with money. I'd give my last cent if this would come to an end. An end... Yes... But what? the transaction is nearly complete, gentlemen. Just one last request to make. Being exceptional personalities... you may have divined what it is. Objections would of course threaten the successful outcome of the whole business. What it is about? Our party demands all your assets. your lives being more valuable. than your money. I repeat. Than... your... money! I wish I had as much money as you imagine I have. I am unable... No use arguing about it. We also expect you to send letters to your relatives before your departure informing them of how you've been treated. Better make it a formal statement of our magnanimous treatment of you. We don't want to use compulsion do we? This would hardly be ethical. Do it of your own free will. The necessary blanks for the transfer are there are at your disposal. Thank you. I... can't... My glasses got broken. Will someone lend him theirs? Try these ones. Thank you. You shouldn't have bothered. Gentlemen... It's a swindle. not one of us will get aboard that ship. Can't we get in touch with a representative of the Red Cross? Under these circumstances... I'm not ready to pay either, Herr Brenske. You were not prepared for this. But I'm afraid... the ship won't sail until I'm certain... of your attitude. A hoax that's what it is. I won't pay one cent more. I need time for reflection. I'm sick of this game. What about my family? Are we all to give up hope? We should have minded our own interest. Since when, Mr. Varecky? Gentlemen, Lady... Heed my warning. You want to commit a crime. Shut up! What are all those tall chimneys? What makes the flames, night and day? What's that greasy black smoke? Shut up! You want our money? Only ours? Not the money of our folks as well? And then the money of our neighbours. And finally the whole world! Don't you want the whole world? Silence! I used to know a different Germany. One day Germany will purge herself of this filth. Or it will be done by someone else. And you'll all hang! Sorry. I didn't give the order. Not all our fellow countrymen are generous enough to overlook defamations of the Reich. Simple minded people. You'll have to excuse them. A dead man... can't testify against himself, pleading guilty of slander. However you are still here, gentlemen. Have the letters... cheques and cables been written yet? And now let me invite you to a farewell banquet. While we wait for the replies from your relatives. Have a hearty meal. I want to get to the final solution - Mr. Lowenstein. - Here. Mr. Varecky. Write a postscript explaining your shaky handwriting by the motion of the train. Your last dinner with us. Enjoy your meals. This has been a surprise for me too. Your authorities don't seem eager to have you back. They are more interested in your money. And in some of our officers. Even the Red Cross seems powerless. Moreover Miss Horovitzova's name is not on your passport. Why make a secret of it? All our disbursements have to be considered a total loss. What does this mean? Acting on instructions, I've had to cancel the reservations due to lack of interest shown by your party. What's more, Hamburg is expecting an air raid. We?ll have to leave the port as soon as possible. Does that mean we've been swindled? It just means a change... of plans. We expected from your party as much willingness as we found in dealing with you. Isn't there any chance at all? An exchange via Switzerland. You have paid for your liberty. Why did you kill Mr. Rappaport? You are so punctilious. Won't he be missing from your sum total? He will. It shouldn't have happened. But in a war, we have to reckon with losses on both sides. We expect you to carry out what you were paid for. Are there any other guarantees? Before we arrive at the place which will set your mind at rest... I want to make your journey... as pleasant as possible. What about Mr. Rappaport's body? Mr. Rappaport will be buried Just as in the case of your wedding Conforming to the regulations We'll have to stop at a camp on our way to Switzerland. We'd have to stop there anyhow. Because of the disinfection prescribed by the Swiss. There, both things... Can be attended to. I want you to know, Sir... that we are losing confidence. in the bona fides of this action. I'll have to convince you by argument. As before. That will be all. Everything has been paid for. We may arrive at our destination before dawn. Gentlemen, this is the dressing room. Not very elegant, I admit. A wartime structure, pure and simple. There will be no vaccination because you are civilians. The Swiss may insist on vaccinating you later. You've shown up till now a most commendable discipline. I've had dealings with many of your kind and none of them had your prudence. Now you'll have to... undress. Remember your box. And when you come back, just wait here We have no separate room for women. This is not temple... just a bath. Put all your valuables into the boxes. You can collect them later. I'd rather you didn't talk with the personnel. I nearly forgot. You'll be accompanied from here by a Swiss physician sent here by the Red Cross. His plane is just landing. Is it necessary, this disinfection? You said by morning we'll be in Switzerland. It's seven in the morning. Seven a.m. The sooner we begin then the sooner we'll finish. A little hygiene can do no harm. As soon as we arrived, I had a... nice bath, myself. And that is sometimes, gentlemen the last thing a man can look forward to. Your suits will be ironed. You can't arrive... in crumpled suits. And now for the final arrangements. Gentlemen... This is an awful soap, gentlemen. This probably is not a soap at all. Get undressed, gentlemen. Don't let the water get cold. You don't want to catch a chill. Everything is ready and just waiting for you. Men women and children all have to go in. Others are waiting already. In the Alps you can do that you like Here you gotta step on it! Put your passports into those safes too. You'll meet with that paper stuff soon enough. Nobody's ever ashamed here. Not in our presence. We've often watched displays you'd be surprised by. Don't tell me that you're ashamed, my dear? You'd nothing on when you were born. Get away, you whelp. I'm going to show you how to tame stubborn mares. So then... You won't obey orders? Get those rags off. You got them from us anyway. And what's under them, you'll have to leave those too. Listen to me. Strip! You got your soap. You've got the number of your box. Don't keep us waiting. What are you afraid of, Carmen from the ghetto? In here, all women get their sun tan in the nude. Commando! O my courageous My combative one Subtitles: Corvusalbus, Kostej from a translation by: M A Gebert
