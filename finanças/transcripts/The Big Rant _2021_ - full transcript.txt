So there is this tale about a fox who sees some delicious looking grapes. He tries to reach and get a bite, but fails. So he tries again and again and again Until he finally says “Fuck it” and decides to leave them.. They were probably sour anyway, right? And that's me. Now, you're probably wondering, oh, a brown guy. He talks funny, dressed up well, so probably works for an IT company, Wrong. Doctor Matthews, I got updates for tomorrow's interview. You'll be promoting the book at... Cancel the event. Come again. You ever look at your life through somebody else's eyes? Would you be able to forgive what you saw? I, Oh, I'm just going to consider the event canceled. Well, hang in there. I'm gonna to tell you everything that happened to me. Definitely gonna to complain a lot throughout this story. So forgive me. My dear listeners, after all the attempts of people screwing me over in Los Angeles, this is the moment that eventually motivated me to leave the town. Hell, I hate this part of the story, but I'm going to start from this point anyway, because I think you'll enjoy it. Hey, this is our guy? Now this is our guy. It's our fucking guy. What's up? Tough guy. How are you doing, huh? Where you going? Ahh! Fucking look at me. And that right there is the most action you'll see in this whole story, my friend. We are gonna see what happens next a bit later, if you don't mind. First off, let's introduce the main character, me. Hi, my name is Harry. And this is a rant about how some random guy in la la land tried to reach those “tasty grapes” just like the rest of the foxes.. Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell, sometimes I don't even know. Sometimes I take it as far as I can. Sometimes I don't even go. My front tracks're headed for a cold water well. My back tracks're covered with snow. Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell. Sometimes I don't even know. Shit, that's me eight years ago. What the fuck am I doing? Damn, that's where I was most confident about myself. And it all went downhill from here. Sorry, I'm a little late guys. Are you sure about this guy, Kumail? Well, nobody else showed up. What the f... Nobody? I got to sit to this tragedy because of a fucking no show? He's not... That bad Course you're gonna to say that. What's that supposed to mean? You know what I mean? All you guys stick together. I'm not even Indian, you racist fuck. Let's start. Let's see. Let's see the third one. Chapter 1 Plan B Harry Short for Harold, right? Actually, it's just how Harry. Harold... I think you should take acting lessons, but, uh, I'd really like to focus on voice acting, to be honest. I know, but, you've got the voice and you've got the passion. But when you when you get the tone and the talent, it's gonna be perfect. There I was a headless chicken listening carefully. The crazy thing is that I'd get bits of wisdom like this all the time because I failed all the time. It always starts the same way. You're good, but. And hey, back then, I welcomed this advice like a kiss ass. Not sure if I can offer any lessons right now. Oh, you need a plan B.. Everyone in L.A. has one. That's how it works. I do gardening on the side. Trust me. Anyone trying to make it in Hollywood does. Right. No, no you can't eat that in here. Studio. But he was... He is the producer. , In the hallway okay? Let's take a momentary break from my part of the act. Little did I know that another of the major players of this story was in a similar situation as me. Tommy, you got a minute? I, uh, I am starting a little something. Here, and I was wondering if you could spread these around for me. Yeah. Yeah, no problem. Thanks. The new batch of paperback is coming in today. Do you have the checklist ready? Great. What's the point of coming in 10 minutes early every day? If you keep on forgetting the important stuff. Wake the fuck up, Will ya? I need it on my desk in ten. Actually, you know what? Forget about it. I'll just give it to Jessie. Well, that was unnecessarily harsh, Oh, no, no she's just stressed! And uh, and and she's right, you know, the paperwork is more your area. Still. It's fine. It'll be fine. Um, doesn't matter. But you better get cracking. Or, you're gonna get an earful. Do you mind if I take one? Oh, not at all, please do. That's what they're there for. It's interesting. Oh, it is. I promise. Here you go. Thank you. You look very disappointed. Today didn't go well. Why? They don't seem to like me. Did you try showing more cleavage? I don't think I'll be able to pay this month's rent. Hmm, just last time. Well you eventually came through the following month, so I'm sure this time will be the same. It's fine. Just remember, It only takes one big hit to break into the industry. Oh, you got mail, by the way? Oh, yeah, I saw it when I came in. And also, dear, I'm still trying to sublet the garden apartment. So, yeah, sure. I'll keep my eyes open. All right. Good man. Well, I'm off to bed. Oh, I'm going to the library tomorrow if you want to come. I'm not sure if I have time to visit the library, but I can drive you there. Well, that will be a nice change of pace. Good night, dear. Good night. And remember one big hit and you're in One Big Hit. That night, with my manuscript in-hand, these words echoed in the head. “Always have a Plan B”. “All it takes is one big hit” An opportunity, any opportunity. And you get the 15 minutes of fame any artist craves. And maybe this could be my plan B. Writing novels. Well, we have to let you go. Oh, yeah, I figured. I'm sorry, but... No, no, no, no, you don't have to be sorry. Oh, no, no. I mean, it's going to be awkward. Umm, Would you still have David Barnum's number? Oh. Did you see how he spoke to me? Well, I would for sure kick his ass if he meets me now. But back then, I was too humble to do it. Because maybe somewhere deep down, I knew, I suck. I'm sorry, we don't have the book you were looking for. But this one is much better. Sure about that? Trust me, you'll love it. Just forget about that book. Okay. Charming Oh! Ssshhhhi... Umm, Any chance we can, like, forget that happened? A report is the last thing I need and my mom she... No, no, no, hey, HEY. Calm down. You're not in any trouble. Really? That was a pretty nifty trick you did with the book there. That guy didn't really want to buy it, did he? Nope. I had a recently set up a publishing company, and I'm looking for a very resourceful assistant. What do you think? You would have to deal with the clientele and general paperwork. I'm, uh, I'm good at one of those two things., You'll learn the other. I dunno... what's the pay? A thousand dollars a week. Done. When do I start? Today. Now. Where are you going? To get myself fired. Oh. Thank you. Yes. No problem. How's the job hunt coming? Um. actually.. Oh, what have you got here? An identical visitor. Just something on the side. If the whole voice thing doesn't work out. Oh, actually, I just got this at the library. It's a new publishing company. I bet they're looking for some new content. Knock on that door. See what happens. So when you're meeting with a publisher. Same thing happens as it does anywhere else in corporate America. Step one, invite them to a nice place. Step two, send in a random person with a mandatory handshake who introduces herself as an "executive" assistant. Well, the fiction novel is actually pretty competitive. Only 20 percent of the books. OK, let me stop you right there. Step three. I'd like to see the main guy here. Sir, you're obviously new at this and I on schedule here, so... Hey, Lenny. Yeah. Zelig? A new gig? You ever get one of those days where your confidence boost affects everything around you? I was handed a last minute voicer gig by Lenny. This guy. Said I was “perfect for the part”. And suddenly Jessie here was scared she might just lose her very first client. Yeah, he wants to see you. Yeah, I'll get there as soon as I'm done with this. Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there. He'll be here any moment. Cool. I just moved here like a year ago, and I've been doing voice acting since then and few things on the side. This is just uh... another “thing on the side”? Exactly. Why don't you tell me about the plot? Glad you asked this, this story about a mundane guy, a simple man, just like you and me. Now our guy wants to be famous at all costs. So, he comes across a time machine. At first, he doesn't know what to do with it. If he does something too big, it could rewrite the history. So he tries to do something smaller. He travels to the future to steal a bestselling book of that time and comes back to present and publishes it with his name, making millions and being acclaimed as a visionary. Hmm. So, what's next? Oh, well, like film producers, publishers mostly work for the audience. This case, the readers and we have demographics of what readers think of the content that they are reading. And we will be working with you on that. What she means is that we may have to make some necessary changes in order to reach your target audience. Oh, it could be a small thing like changing the cover, some character names, adding diversity. Yeah, exactly. Just like in movie theaters. Uhh, people buy tickets to forget their day to day life. I tell you what I do. Instead of this mundane guy, come up with a character who's larger than life, make him a time traveler to be to begin with. A man who travels through the universe's various ages. Yeah. A witness to history, if you will. And that part about entertainment? Oh, oh, make that his tragic flaw. Instead of not using his time machine because he doesn't know what could happen, he knows exactly what the consequences of his actions are. Which is why he focuses on the smaller things, like like stealing books to entertain himself. Because he knows that when he stops being entertained, it might tempt him to use this machine for far more sinister purposes. That's specific. Ok, so you want me to make it about someone else then? Mr. Chandra, just how much writing experience do you have? This is my first. It's all right. We can publish you as a debut writer something that is good marketing wise. Ok. Let me be a little honest here. I don't want to make any changes. I don't feel like making any changes. So either you can publish it or simply forget about it. Well, let's not... As I said, I'm on schedule. It's ok. It's ok. Let me know if anything changes. Charming Hey, Lenny. 15 minutes, my ETA. See you buddy. I didn't think you'd still up. I'm not usually. It's a urgent request from a client. They're overseas. Ok, so do you want me to do an American accent? or... you're perfect. Sure? I can. Moroccan real estate's a distant dream. Now a warm home closer to your heart. The smallest of wins in a journey means a lot to us, ordinary foxes. Of course, there will be bumps on the road if plan B fails? Jump back to plan A and figure out what went wrong. You will find that is always a room for the new beginning. I'm from New York. Oh, the Big Apple. What brings you to La La Land? I came here to pursue acting. You're an actress? Yep. The only one in L.A.. You know what they say? There're as many people coming to Hollywood as they're leaving it. A little distraction and you're ready to change your Plan B. You think you could give me some acting lessons? Yeah. Sure. This would be a nice place to end the story, right? Wrong. Two years later, the only person who really cared about me was taken away. A stroke took us all by surprise. Of course, I moved to a new place, start a new life again. Just remember one big hit and you are in. But she never left me. Not really. “One big hit”... Hey, it's Ted. Do your thing after the tone. Hey, Ted, it's um, it's Harry. I'm trying to get back out there, started acting, too now. Hit me up if you're looking for any actors. I'm here to serve you. I don't know what I want. Or at least I think I do. All right, I don't. The truth is, I know I have potential. I just don't know what to do with it. In freshman year, they would ask us what we wanted to be when you grew up. And every day kids would say things like, I'm going to be a doctor, an accountant, a teacher, a lawyer, president. And then my turn would come. And I couldn't answer. Because my answer was beaten out of me. Every day. Scene. All right, so now that we're ready to focus on some specifics, let's create a character that you see yourself playing. And if you're struggling to come up with one on your own. Harry, here is willing to share some of his mock up scripts with you guys. OK, I'll see you next week. Hey, you OK? Hey. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for the mockups, by the way. I owe you one. So how's the new place? Not cheap. Yeah, well, my landlord's a dick. So, this asshole replaced Mrs. Loretta and the one who is suffering from him is, Emily. So, Jonathan, here, he's been reading your mock ups. I think you have a fan. Jonathan, meet Harry. Harry, Jonathan. Hi, I am a writer myself. I have a bookstore down in Magnolia. I must say, I know that these are just mock ups, but I love it. Your characters have depth lots of interesting conflict and backstory. Love the dialogue. You think so? No yeah, honestly, not quite there in terms of story, but you have a really good sense of structure. Good job. Thanks. I think so, too. I write it for the actors here. Yeah, I got that. Why don't you come by my bookstore sometime? I bet there's a lot that we can talk about. Yeah, definitely. Mm. Sounds good. Great. Hey, what's up? Do you wanna get coffee sometime? Are you... Yes, I am asking you out on a date. Harry, you're a great guy but... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Emily, I just got a part on Gray's Anatomy, Gray's Anatomy, Gray's Anatomy. It's amazing. Congratulations. I know, how hard you've been working. Well, I got to go. Call my mom. I'm sorry. That's a cliché. Awkward, stupid and just fucking embarrassing. Similar to my misery back then. Hey, it's Ted. Do your thing after the tone. The good, the bad, the ugly, The Blue, The Gray, The Civil War. You talking to me? Yeah, you. You talking to me? Who the fuck you think you're talking to? Well, I don't see anyone here. You must be talking to me. Hail to the man whom doth live his own life like a tumbling weed, friction on the ground, and yet it doesn't stand still. Standstill. 'Ere fighting his way to bring the change, or be the change. Harry... Hey Ted, you remember me... You gotta stop fucking calling me my man. You told me to call you when I'd be interested in some kind of a you know... I was being fucking polite, dude. Don't you get it? What's the matter with you, man? But why would you lie then? I don't understand why. I mean, like... okay, you want to know why? It's because you suck. Plain and simple. Oh, I don't. I've been taking lessons. I know. I've seen them. And you still suck. And it's not just that man. It's just not fun to fucking be around. You're a loser. You know what? You're a fucking loser and you're losing your chance to work with me. “I'm losing a chance”? Who even talks like that?! You told me to tell you my schedule and you could fix something up. And you believe that shit, you fucking moron. Well, you're not being polite, are you? Lenny, told me what you were saying about me when you thought I couldn't hear you. Honestly, you know what? I just wanted to get some updates. But you know what? You're a racist fuck. There are millions of people out there. And I will knock on every door. And I think it's my duty to let you know that you hear me, Ted, your piece of shit. You're a fucking piece of shit. Ted? Ted? Welcome to my world. Won't you come on in? Hey, it's Ted. Do your thing after the tone.. Hey, Ted I'm sorry... I was stressed out, and I, Step into my heart. Leave your cares behind. And I don't know what to do, Sure my life wasn't as unstable as it was three years ago. But plans A to Z were all failing. And when you're surviving rather than living, there is always this point where you wonder, what am I gonna do? What am I looking for? I'll be waiting here. With my arms on fur. Waiting just for you. Welcome to my world. Chapter 2 Three Suspects Harry! So good to see you. It's a really nice book-store you got here. Thank you. Coffee or tea? Sam? Sam? Could you... Tea should be fine. Could you get some tea? So... see anything you like? No, just browsing, of course, you know. I suppose you would love to have some of your work on these shelves one day. Not really. But hey, if it'll help to get my name out there, then... Yeah. Anything to get your name on my great Walk of Fame? Exactly. These are some of those geniuses. It's Dr. Matthews. His first book, actually, it's getting very good reviews, Please, these so-called reviews suck. I recognize the names. I read this stuff all the time. Even I could do better. OK, well, if you're lucky, maybe you'll get an opportunity to. How much for this? Consider it a gift. Hey, Emily, you got a minute? Harry, look I told you. No, no, no, no, it's not about that. I need you to do me a favor. You owe me and remember. Yeah. What's up? I need you to go to the basement. That's not creepy at all. No, no, no. Remember my manuscript? I need it to prove someone has stole my idea. Good thinking. Whatever you have to do. Make it quick. I'm trying. It's not my fault he's so disorganized. Harry? Well? I'm sorry, I've got nothing. We have three potential suspects, Dr. Matthews. Second one is Jessie. Zelig's assistant. And third one is Mr. Zelig himself. One of them stole my book. I just know it. 911. What is your emergency? I know what this looks like. But I got proof. The premise is the same except for one key difference. Get this: “a book-publisher with a time-machine travels to the future to steal a bestselling book of that time and comes back to present publishes it under client's name. I mean, come on, guys, he is admitting it. And is there any way anybody could have known this story? No. You didn't like tell it to somebody out loud or something, did you? Oh, shit. Why didn't he just go to copyright lawyer with this? Yes, well, I did. And what did they say? They said I got no proof, which is ridiculous, because the dialog in the book is literally the one I had in my manuscript, which is the one you said was stolen. Yes. Without which you can't prove it. Oh, fuck. Well, I guess you got something for your next book, what we're going to do is we're going to do a log entry. Can't believe we're missing doughnuts for this. We're going to do a log entry like we've done the other times that we've come. And it's it's kind of like a report. And our reports take a lot longer and they're kept at the station. The log entry will stay in the car with us rather than in the station where the detectives might find it and actually do something with it. And so if you ever need it, just call the station. As for one of us, and we'll make sure you get a copy of that. Yes, yes, yes that is helpful. Fucking moron. And that was that. What you thought I was gonna track Zelig or Jessie down? I'm an actor, not Batman. Get real. Just remember one big hit and you're in. Sounds interesting, interesting, interesting Mr. Chandler. Just how much writing experience do you have? It's just not fun to fucking be around. You're a loser. You have a really good sense of structure. This is a story about a mundane guy simple man, just like you and me now our guy wants to be our guy is a loser. A fuck-up. A nobody But he really wants to be somebody, no matter what he does, no matter how good he gets, he is never quite not what people are looking for. Despite his talent. He's all He's alone. Alone That's when he finds something. Something that allows him to rewrite who he really is.. Something that shows he might be good at something, after all. A time machine. Our guy uses a time machine to travel back in time and steals a book that would have been a bestseller and publishes in his own time. In doing so, he is seen for the wonder he is. His worth is reinvented, and his existence is finally... acknowledged. And he was never alone again. So you're halfway through the book? Yes, I am. Ok. I have a contact for you. I'll tell them about you. And you do understand that I'm not talking about the sellouts quoted on the back of these ones, right? Of course not, sweetie. You want to hear from the best, but those sellouts are the best. Sure. They phone in a reviewer, too, but they're the ones you going to want to hear from. Ok, fair enough. I'll just email them and see. Oh, no, you have to meet them in person. You have to. The last time I did, they stole my idea, and I'm still going through copywriting process. The last time you didn't give crapola about publishing your book and you backed out, the second it became actual work. Don't self sabotage. Meet them. Ok, thanks. You're welcome. Hello. Hello, Mr. Pritchett? Yes, this is he. This is Harry Chandra, I'm calling you to ask. Look buddy, whatever you're selling. I'm not interested. You're probably wondering why he hung up on me? Hell, he got confused for an Indian Telemarketer. Fuck! Hello. This is Harry Chandra, Jonathan gave me your reference. Ah, yes. Yeah. The actor. Yes. So, how can I help? Well, I'm sure that I've been told I was wondering if I could get some feedback. Maybe later in the week. Yeah. Oh, I'm I'm not so sure about that. I'm pretty swamped this week. Next week is fine, too. Wait, wait, wait. I don't know anything. I didn't even say anything yet. Why do you look scared? I read the book, man. Zelig and his new client... Dr. Matthews? Yeah. They were up to stuff. Bad stuff? I don't know. I wasn't kept in the loop. You must to trust me. I don't know anything. Now you, dear listeners, are probably wondering “why”.. Why didn't I take her to the cops? Trust me, guys, I just didn't think about it at the time. Someone was definitely screwing up with my life. But the number of suspects remained three nonetheless. Zelig, Matthews... And the Mysterious Man. I never chased him because I'm just a fox. Remember? You probably remember Mr. Pritchett, right? The Reviewer I was talking to a while ago. He and his wife are having a party. Why? Who gives a shit? The point is, when my second book got stolen three years ago, I impressed him with my story analyzing skills, and he hired me to work for him. Now, I have a skill to critique any damn book out there. His words not mine. Doesn't make it untrue, though. To this day, I have reviewed over 138 novels, 23 audiobooks and, 13 professional screenplays, as well as judging everyone I come across. Now, if you're a fox and you're getting those grapes from some place else easily, you're going to get it right. I did the same thing. Well, it's all fake. Fake people. Fake laughter. Fake Boobs. What about her necklace? Well, that, my dear, remains to be seen. And why is that? Well the entire party is very cliché. All that's missing is a power-cut, like in the films. If that happens... then it's real. Exactly. The more the drama surrounds it, the more clear it becomes that they're desperate to show it's real when it's not. Interesting. Very interesting Very Ahhh! What? My necklace is gone! Your necklace is gone. Yeah. What the hell happened to it? What do you think? I took it from you. What? Why don't you look between your? Are you from the future? I always thought this was my 15 minutes of fame. All right, I'll get him. Mr. Pritchett would like to see you in his office. Gotcha. And about last night, yeah, about last night. You see sometimes people have sex at parties. You know, it happens. Alcohol's involved, fluids are swapped and it happens. Just come on. Follow me on delay. Come on. Come on, follow me. He wants to see you. You know the way he is. Jerry, I'm telling you, it's a necessary evil. Dig deeper. Only you can handle this investigation. OK, look here, you little shit. I trusted you and your partner, Steve. No, I know his name's not actually Steve. His name is... Phil. Phil? Phil.. Yes. And I know everything that's going on over there. Bottom line is, it's your case. Sure. Just give me a fucking report. All right. Wonderful. See, you guys have fun. So, Harry, what can I do you for? You called me in here. I know it was a test. I wanted to see if you were a man enough to admit your own ignorance. I'm sorry to hear about Mrs. Pritchett, last night. How's she holding up? Oh, we're getting a divorce. I'm sorry to hear about that. Tell me about it. My lawyer's basically stealing from me. So, Harry, you're doing pretty well here. Yeah. You got fans, readers and the critiques you write will make or break the book's future. You're killing it, right? Right. Wrong. I'm not sure you're aware that literally. Everyone is asking you to do one thing. Write a novel, your fans want you to do it so you can show them who's boss your haters want you to do, so they could see you fail and show you're a hypocrite. Which one are you? I'm the one who's newspapers going to publish the damn thing. But you got to write something. The people have spoken. Give them what they want. What people? I don't hear any people here. No, but you're hearing me. I speak for the people. And once your book is published, you, too, will have the same power here. Honey. No, this is the office. You can't call me here. You know that. We decided on that last night. But you can't back off from that now. It's over, Martha. OK, sweetie, I can't be nice to two people at the same time. I'll call you later. Where were we? With all due respect, Mr. Pritchett, I'm on a roll right now and this book thing is gonna to break it. See, kid? I'm trying to pull you up to a whole new level of success, but you have to go limp for me so I can pull you all the way up. Huh? It's this. Oh, you're fired. This is unfair. You cannot do that. I won't write it. I won't write it. I won't write it. I can't write it. I won't write it. No, I won't write. So I'm writing it. Ok. I'm telling you, I'm tired of being pushed around all the time. You gotta make a move, man! Stand up for yourself. No, I'm just gonna get this over with, you know, phone it in. God forbid you make an effort. So Em, what's this big news you wanted to tell us? Oh, yeah, that's right. All right, here it goes. We're all ears. Ok, here it goes. I just signed my first feature film with a studio. Oh, my god. Directed by Sofia Coppola. Hmm. First half is filming in New England. And then we're moving to New York. So I'm going to get to see my parents. That's great. Amazing. That's amazing. So happy for you. To, Emily. Oh! Oh, it feels like you moved in here yesterday and you have been by my side through thick and thin ever since we started our journey together. Actually, you started much later than me, didn't you? Harry, whatever the bottom line is, I'm happy for you and I wish you all the best on this movie. That's not really the vibes I'm getting here. Well, you know, I think I'm understandably conflicted. Conflicted? About me succeeding. Guys, chill. I'm chill, I'm chill! It's just, things were finally taking shape. Now it's all falling apart. Harry, you're finally where you wanted to be, aren't you? Oh, yeah, reviewing fucking books is what I wanted to do all along. Well, if you had stuck with voice acting instead of leaving halfway, you probably would have made it by now. I mean, you're supposed to fix yourself a goal and then work towards it. Where'd you get that, The Secret? Tell me this. Oh Guru: have you ever lost a gig because of your accent? Have you ever lost a gig because you didn't suck the producer's dick? Oh, of course you're going to play that card. “That card”? You know what, Harry? Fuck you. I have been working my ass off for six years. And when I finally get my foot in the door, you're being an asshole. What do you want to say? Congratulations, Emily. I'm happy for you. I am happy for you. Guys tell her. I'm happy for you. Get the fuck out. This was supposed to be my night, and you're bringing your own personal shit into it. Get the fuck out. Wait, Emily. It's okay Jonathan. It's just means you, me and Sam will be spending more time together. See you at the bookstore tomorrow. Harry. We're moving out too. Guys, I'm sorry. I was'nt gonna bring it up this way. But, um, some things have changed. For, for me, for us and. And, and so what that means is that uh, What? Well, we've we've, we've Uh... We're moving to Florida. I sold the bookstore. You're kidding me, right? Chapter 3 Other Side Of the Fence. My name is Edson Alves Jr. I'm the writer of the book series Criminals. Hi, my name is Colette Freedman and I wrote Sister Cities. Hi, my name is Ines des Santos, and I'm the writer of Randy. It's about six teenagers that they kill a girl and then they must hide it for the whole story of the eight novels. A story about four strange sisters who reunite for their mom's alleged suicide. Randy is a comic book series about Randy, who is the guy that goes from state to state, having sex with a bunch of girls. In my long history as a novelist, the greatest critic I have ever experienced is my dear friend Harry Chandra. He was just like, ha, ha, ha. Harry, inspired me to write the film. And it's been acquired by Netflix starring Jacki Weaver and Alfred Molina and Jess Blakeslee, Michelle Trachtenberg, Dwayne Bellisario, you name it. They're in it. And I give all of my credit to Harry. He is he is just a genius. He is not a fucking genius, ok? He's not. This boy, this man child has an insight that it's like he pulls it out of my soul. He says, oh, it's good. Oh, it's bad. And he ruined somebody's career just like that. He knows he knows what he's writing about. He knows how to phrase everything. We take time. We take effort writing this shit. And then he just like does two fucking essay paragraphs and we're done. He's like the Blake Snyder for screenwriters. He has an insight that most 80 year old women don't have. Harry, how do you even pronounce that name? Hari? Uh? He's a great act... He's a great writer. I love you Harry. As Blake Snyder was pushed. I have to challenge you now, Harry. Write. Write something yourself, Harry. Stop critiquing other people and have the balls to do it yourself. You're that good. Because one thing is criticizing and the other thing is fucking writing it. A book of his own. You know, I really want to see like how good he is as a writer. I just want to read it. I just want to have fun with it. And I'm very excited to hear more about it. So, yeah, Harry, you go ahead and fucking write that book because I want to see you suck. Thank you, Colette Freedman, sister cities, it's available on Amazon. That's that's that's the thing, Harry, you, me, you, me, worldstar, worldstar, bring it in, Harry, is that all you got, Harry? Is that all you got, Harry? I love Harry like a son. And you know, the one thing I always give them crap for, he's too generous. He insisted that I let him take on this challenge. And he's writing this for all of you, his fans. So all of you can improve his writers alongside him. I, for one, am excited, right, Amy? It's Ariel. Ariel, yes. Now you're finally writing a book. What is it going to be about? Nobody knows. Well, there is nothing much I can tell you at this moment. Actually, there is this one thing I've had this project since 2007, but I never actually followed through with actually writing it , and I'm going to stick to it and give you all something great. And Mr. Pritchett, the head editor of the to look at times it's general knowledge that he took me under his wing three years ago. Is he coaching you with writing this? Traveled back to the future. Publishing companies. Nobody seemed to like the book. These futuristic themes are too advanced for nowadays. You might get the fame you desire in a century or two. Shelved. But you failed, right? You're not a hero anymore. You're more than that. I'm a human. Hey, Harry, look who just, decided to join us. All right, everyone, that's your cue. Writing for somebody else is a first. I only voted for myself until now. Never expected to have an audience. Look, take your time. All right. Take a couple of weeks off. Every writer needs inspiration and motivation. Go on a vacation. Hey, wanna go to Hawaii? Anyway? Get it done and get it done quick. You told me to take my time. Take your time and get it done quickly. Harry, don't be such a pain in the ass to get my point. Here is the thing. Back then, I was not mature enough to get the feedback when it was giving it to me. I am now. The basis of the book is all up here. The challenge is to allow my characters to grow as much as I have, - um, - I'm sure it's gonna be great. Hey, this is our guy? Now, this is our guy. It's our fucking guy. What's up tough guy? How you doing huh? Where you going? Ah! Fucking look at me, fucking look at me. Have a nice fucking day. Hey... Harry? Harry, what are you doing, Harry? You can't go up there, Harry. You know the way he is. He's in a meeting. You can't go up there. Of course, we'll put our best man on the job. Oh, here he is right now. I'm on a call kid. See you in five. Get out. Yes. Don't worry. We've got it covered. Some books to review. This is a new priority, not a novel. Wait, what? Pritchett words, not mine. And this, my friends, is where I decided to call it quits. Guess who wrote one of these new books I was assigned, The Mysterious Man. The guy who stole from me and made millions of off my work. And left me with something. So that's why you're not hearing from me anymore. I try to reach those grapes, but they are just too high. So I said, fuck it once again and for all. I'm sorry if I left you all without notice. If it helps know that I'm at peace now. I'm living a life where I'm finally myself and no amount of failed casting calls, plagiarized novels. Or lost friends is gonna change that. That's the end of my big rant. This is Harry Chandra signing out. No, no, no, not Harold. I'm looking for Harry. The author of this audio book. Oh, I know now I know you can't. Oh, I know you can't tell me his whereabouts for privacy purposes. I was just wondering where I might get a message to him. Oh, that would work. My turn to rant now, Harry. Harry sends these from time to time. Excuse me. Hey, what's up? Yeah, sounds great. Send me the script, I'll give it a read. Hope it helps. Doctor Matthews. Howdy. I don't mean to bother you, but I saw your name and check in and I'm a huge fan. I even got all your books. Do you mind signing them for me? Well, I'll sign these four. I'm not signing that. How about I buy it from you? Well, all right. You got a pen, son? So how long you staying here? Just passing through. Howdy. What are you drinking? I was hoping for an autograph. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, I come in peace? And you'll leave in pieces. Harry, calm down, man. I swear I wasn't boasting I was... I'm just trying to make a cool entrance. I didn't write it. Yeah, I didn't write it. I know it. You know it. Let's just talk, OK? I'm just here to talk. I never knew it was yours until I listened to your audio book. Zelig just asked for permission and slapped my name on the cover. Well it must have been somebody's book, you didn't think to ask? He told me he paid some ghostwriter to do it. That stuff happens all the time. Convenient. Look, I did play a part in everything that happened to you, I admit that. Some kid wanted me to sign this and I just couldn't do it. And it's not the first time it happened. I'm still waiting on that public “I never wrote it” statement. I'm not going to do that. OK. After “With Love, From Future” I penned four more novels. If I reveal it I didn't write the book that made me, I'll discredit the ones I wrote. Fuck you. Oh, come on, man. I tracked you down. I came all the way out here to apologize. Don't give me a hard time, we both know I'm not the guy you're really mad at, here. Fair enough. You know what? I accept your apology. You mind if I ask you something? Why didn't you take Jessie to the police? She probably would have confessed right then and there. I know you said that you forgot, but I don't think you did. Look, I accepted your apology. We don't need to make conversation. I'm off. No, no, I'm serious. Well, this stays in the room. I didn't write the original manuscript. I found it in my mail one day. It's also why I didn't take Zelig's feedback when he offered it me. I was afraid I'd ruin it if I made any changes. I see... You wanna know what's crazy? I re-wrote it in it's entirety for Pritchett. Yeah, I heard the audiobook. No, no, no. I wasn't writing it from my memory. I just showed what came to my mind and what came to my mind was exactly what I had in the manuscript to begin with. That's crazy, right? Ah? What? I met Zelig once. And, then he was gone. Did you ever wonder who sent you the manuscript in the first place? Yeah, sure, but... What if nobody ever stole from you? What if it was you who was, let's say, renting the idea in the first place? I still don't get it. His company name, VIATOR. It means 'The Traveler' in latin. As in the main character in all your books, The Time Traveler. Zelig the Time-Traveler? Zelig the Time-Traveler. Coursing through history. Witnessing it participating whenever he feels like it. Which is why he focuses on the smaller things, like, like stealing books to entertain himself. “Entertainment”. And he gets bored, you know, jumps from job to job era to era. So in this era, he tries a lot of mundane jobs and publishers, just one of them. And he's good at it, too. But then somebody comes along and tells them a story, a story about a character who eerily sounds a lot like him. This isn't a coincidence. This is a message from his future self who somehow got his hands on your version of “An Identical Visitor”.. And that message says. “Do exactly what this idiot's telling you to do, and your story will become immortal”. But you didn't wanna play game. So, huh? Well, travel to the right moment in time when he could have free access to. Wealth wasn't enough. He wanted fame, and you told an outline of your story to Pritchett. And by this time, Zelig's a known publisher... and has regular chats with Pritchett, who likes the sound of his own voicee so much that he probably let your story slip at some point. So that's what he did. He traveled to the past. He stole a bestseller and published it under his name. Leaving you with nothing. Oh. Holy shit. Yeah. Of course, there is another theory. What's that? There is a God and he loves watching you lose your shit. Oh, strangely enough, I prefer the first one. It's the one that makes the most sense. Despite it involving time-travel? It's detailed. Surprisingly detailed. Well, you must have listened to my audio book many times over. Well, when the narration is captivating, the story becomes a more vivid, immersive experience. Can you rephrase that? You're a great voice actor, Harry. I felt like I was right there with you when I was listening to it. So are you really out of the writing business? Because if so that's too bad, I got friends who would really be interested. It's fine. Just remember, it only takes one big hit to break into the industry. All it takes is one big hit. An opportunity, any opportunity. And you get the 15 minutes of fame every artist craves. I spent the last eight years ranting about everything that happened to me. If only I could just go back and relive those moments again. One big hit. My previous attempts at getting it never ended well. But what do you guys think? The third time's the charm.
