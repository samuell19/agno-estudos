- Yeah. - Have you seen my book? - What book? - My lines. - Did you check the kitchen? - No. What you doing? I'm looking for my lines. Your lions? Yes. What do you mean, your lions? Chekov! Oh, your play? - Mm. - I was reading it. It's right here. Sorry. Oh, my God. I'm so lost. I don't know where I am. - What do you mean? - I can't find her. I don't know, one day I know, one day, the next day, I don't know. One day I know what I want and the next day she's different. Well, you know what you want? Not always. Well...are they helping you with the gym class or something? I mean are you going to... Are you asking your teacher about this? I've done everything they did. I've, liked... I've... I've read books, I've watched pictures I've read about her and it doesn't help me. Don't get all upset about it, it's not like it's you. It's just a character. - Hello. - Mm-hm? I'm going to the deli downstairs, do you want anything? Mm. Um-umm... Can you pick up some watermelon? - Mm-hm. - Um-umm. Thanks. - Oh, and a paper too. - Sure! There was something about his wife was going to Paris and, for the shows, he was going to meet her over there. So, I think it's cooled off a little bit. Well, would they be back within few days or a week, or what are we talking about? Hopefully within the week? Yeah. Well, has there been anybody else that's expressed any interest in one or...? 'Cause I know a bunch of people were talking about... It's incredible. Gordon, this new work is incredible. Yeah. I like it. I like where I'm at. Everybody, there's a buzz about it. It's really interesting. So, a show... Actually, there's a lot of people who've seen the piece. - Yeah? - I mean, nothing really specific. - But it looks good. - Good. I, uh... I just, is there any way I can get in touch with the guy? - Have you talked to the guy? - You can't call this person! Well, it's kind of urgent. I mean, I, uh... What's wrong? Well, I just want to see if I can move one of them, maybe, maybe both. I mean, it doesn't matter if it's him. It doesn't matter who it is. I just need to... Listen, Gordon, they're gonna move, it's not a problem. If it's...not a problem, and everybody loves it, and then they're gonna move, um... ..is there a possibility of you advancing me some money against those? Gordon, this is a surprise. Well.. Um... I'm sorry, if it's a surprise or something, but it's urgent. I really do need some money. I mean, and they're gonna move, they're gonna move. I'm good for it. I mean, they're... They're gonna move but the problem is, they're not going to move as fast as they did, let's say, the first time I showed you. You know, that last show was a real problem. Well, it's sold out! All 13 of them sold out. Yeah, Gordon, but it took nine months to sell at the show. I mean, I'm used to having shows sell before the wine's open! - But they sold. I mean... - It was a struggle. Listen, these two are gonna sell definitely. they're worth twice as much as all 13 of those. I agree with you! These pieces are much better. - This is... - So... It's the best work you've done. But it's, you know, we have to battle against this reputation you have from your last show. So, I'm good for it. I mean, listen, come on, they're gonna move, okay? So, they're gonna move. Gordon, they're gonna move. It's just gonna take time. Why can't you just give them a phone call? You know, get a yes or no. Listen, Gordon, let's face it. We have the other reputation to think about too. You know, that's part of the problem. - My other reputation? - Yeah. Oh, my other reputation. Well, I'm concerned about this reputation... I... You know, come on. The reputation of me as a painter. That's all I want to do, is move a painting, one painting. Not even two paintings. One painting! Hi, Howard? Hi. It's Felicity. No, I need to ask you a question. I was just wanting to know, which... This is kind of difficult for me to phrase, but... but I was wondering if any of the stocks that you bought for me were socially responsible. Do you know what this... Do you know what I'm talking about? Well, no, I was wondering about... I was wondering about candy companies. I mean, I don't know if they're just candy companies, but... the thing I was really wondering about was, if I own any stocks, are there any stocks in my name for gum companies? Yeah, because, uh... because I think, you know, I really am starting to feel guilty about contributing to the demise of the rain forest, you know, and there's this thing that these gum companies can either buy their chicle from rubber tappers or they can buy it from people who chop the whole tree down. And I think that there should be some incentive for them to buy it from the rubber tappers 'cause if the trees are chopped down and they're gone... You're horse problem is not my problem. - My horse problem. - Yeah, your horse problem. My horse problem. Yeah, I got a horse problem, all right. I'm not on the right horse. I'm not riding on the right horse. I thought, you know... - Listen, Gordon... - I thought you were my friend. You know, I thought you were my friend, Gracie. God, come on. It's like 10 days, two weeks, I can... I'll guarantee in writing. You can have my next two paintings. You can have them. I'll give them to you. - Gordon... - You can sell them for whatever you want. Now, that's a good deal. How can you pass that up? Why are you making this so difficult for me? Because I... I goddamn well need it! - I need it! - Gordon, I am not a bank. And I don't lend money to friends. All right, so, you're not my friend. Let's do this strictly... Let's do this strictly as a business, not a bank, not a friend. Just... This is ridiculous. We're talking about $10,000. It's not ridiculous. $10,000. I mean, my next three or four paintings are double that, maybe even triple! Gordon, I would give you 100 here, 100 there, but $10,000? Forget it. ..Holdings or whatever they are? She just mentioned them to me. And I think, you know, I really don't feel comfortable with that at all. I mean, you know, buy them for somebody else. I don't want to have my name associated with this, you know? But... Well, I, you know, it's... I just don't feel comfortable with that. - Felicity? - No. Oh. Oh, can you hold on one second? - Oh, hi. - Hi. Uh, I'm gonna have to call you back later, but if you could find some of that out, I'd really appreciate it. Okay, okay. Thank you. Bye, bye. - Oh, I'm sorry. - That's all right. - How are you? - Fine! I wanted to ask you some questions about this collection. Sure! What would you like to know? Well, I want to know how well it's been selling. Oh, it's been it's been selling really, really wonderfully. I mean, it's, uh... - How many pieces are left? - Um, well, I think most of them are sold. I think there might be one or two left that are just optioned. But, you know, you'd have to talk to Gracie about that, because she really knows more, but people just love them. Who... Can you tell me whose collections... - Well, I... - ..They're going into? I don't...I don't think I could tell you the names, but they've all, they've all gone to really good collections. People whose names you recognise? - Yeah. - Good. And you know, you could always ask Gracie, about that. Right. Okay. Do you think that I could talk to her? Yeah, she's got an artist in there, but let me just check. - Hold on one second, okay? - Okay. Look, I gotta... I gotta have the money! Uh, Mrs Ainsworth is here. Okay. Listen, I need the money. I need the $10,000 I need it. It's not like I want it, I need it. They're gonna bust me up! They're gonna bust on my hands! - I need the money! - Gordon? Get out of here. I... Jesus. Gracie? Oh, Ariel. Hi. I'm sorry. - How are you? - Fine. How are you doing? I'm great. So, it sounded like you were having a little fracas. - Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. I wanted to ask you some questions about the paintings. Oh, great. Let's go out and take a look. Okay. How are they doing? - It's doing wonderfully. - Good! Glad to hear that my favourite painter is doing well. He's doing more than well. There were some reserves yesterday, but this morning, I talked to the people and everything has been... is firm at this point. There's got to be something... Who's got the red one? I have the red one. Ariel, what are you asking me? Uh...we'll work a deal. See how central these brushstrokes are? He kind of paints them with the grain of the muscles. It's beautiful. And it's not at all monochromatic. He uses so many different tones of red. From a distance, you would think it's monochromatic, but it's not. Oh, it's true. It's interesting. You have a very interesting take on this piece. I mean, this is the greatest piece in the show, I think. I know and I've got the seminal piece from each series. And I'm gonna have this one too. Aren't I? Well... You know, I have a piece of Gordon's in the back I'd like to show you. Gordon? Gordon, you got a piece from his first show and then the last show, I think you missed. But his work is really incredible. - He's doing... - I liked his earlier work, but, Gracie, I don't think that his later pieces are going to hold their value. Gordon! Gordon, what's that? Uh, I was just taking it back for some, uh, touch-ups. - You know, Mrs Ainsworth, don't you? - Hi, Gordon, how are you? - Pleasure to meet you. How are you? - I've seen you before. Yeah, I've got a couple of pieces of work in my studio, if you're interested in seeing them. Yeah, I'd love to take you over to his studio. Well, you can just come over with me right now. Sure! I'd love to. Why don't I do that? Let me check with Felicity and see if there's any other appointments this afternoon. Sure. See you later. Have you had your portrait taken, Gordon? Scum, Gordon! I got good news... and I got bad news. I think, uh... Lulu is gonna get sick. That's right. Little Lulu is gonna get sick. She's got a cough. I spoke to somebody last night, I spoke to her doctor last night. She's got a cough. And her nose is starting to run. So, I have a feeling she's gonna be very sick, if not today, tomorrow, or by the end of the week. And that's going to be very good for all of us. So, uh... We're coming in there to make her feel better. Probably, uh, I don't wanna give a specific amount of time, but you know how sick she can get, how sick she should get, but we'll come in and make her feel better. We'll play doctor, you and I. That's right. She's gonna feel much better. We'll go in there. We'll hold her hand. Okay. I'll talk to you. Hey, XTN, I want 16K at five and a half. Do that... 16K at five and a half. You're not listening to me. Who left 4100 on hold? They're an institutional client. Come on. They're very important. You don't leave them on hold. You make sure somebody picks up. I don't want them hanging out there like that. Take care of it. I'll take 24,000 of that. 24,000 and a half. All right. Let's go. What do you mean you've got a headache? What do you mean you have a headache? I just saved your ass! You could have been hanging out with your shvantz in the wind, if it wasn't for me. Hey, don't tell me it didn't die. So, it looks like it's alive. I'm telling you it's dead. There's no floor to it. If it bounced, it bounced off the walls on the way down. I got you out of there just in time. Believe me. You wait till the end of the day. You're gonna be thanking me. You bet. You bet. Tell you what. Three o'clock today, I want a big present from you, okay? 'Cause you're gonna see I was right. Of course I was right. Get out of here. Who's doing anything about NATC? It's down a corridor. What are we doing? What are we doing? Come on, wake up out there. Let's go. Let's see some movement. What do you want? What do you want? Call your buddy on 15. He wants to talk to you on something. 15? He's not my friend. He's your friend. Called for you, though. You call him. I'm not calling him. He's not my friend. I don't owe him anything. - You call him. - No, you call him. I talked to him already. You talk to him. - Then Billy will call him. Billy! - Good, let Billy talk to him. You call 15. Pick it up. Call 15. Okay? I don't want to deal with that guy, he's a... Yeah. No, no, no. He was being completely honest with you, I'm sure. Yeah. Listen... I think their advice is very sound. And, if you want, we'll get you out of there by the end of the day. I think that's a good move. I don't disagree with that at all. There's no... Okay. So, we'll take care of that. Nah, don't be so nervous. Have you heard anything about...NFQR? - Got anything on that? - Nothing at all, nothing. It's a mystery quiz. I want a prospectus on that. - See what we can do. - Hey, Willy! Willy! It's amazing, isn't it? You just have to pretend I'm speaking French, okay? Yep. All right. - You have to talk very... - Very quietly! Something like that. Say it really quietly, okay, yeah. But, but...just... Okay. If you decide that you want to leave, you just... you can say it, okay? So, I won't say it. - All right. - Okay? Okay. We'll see! I don't know. Thanks for coming anyway. We'll see. I don't... I don't think he is very interesting. I don't know. There he is. - Okay. - Okay. - I don't speak English. - Okay. Hello. Hi. Hi. I'm Felicity. I'm Mark. - This is Anna. - Bonjour. But she doesn't speak English, so that's why I have to... French! I didn't know. I, uh, brought you flowers. Merci. I don't know how you say you're welcome, but... Merci. I didn't know there was going to be two of you. Well, you've each got one. You're gonna have one too. What was your name? - Felicity. - Felicity. Pleased to meet you. - Have you been waiting long? - No, no. - Just a few minutes. - Let me... Um, she'd like to know why you gave her the note at the Met. Um... I gave her the note at the Met because she's incredibly beautiful and she looks a lot like the painting that was the centre of the room. She wants to know what you want. I want to drink. Is there a waiter. Yes? No. You have to go to the bar. I have to go to the bar. Um... I want to get to meet her, if I may. I'll be right back. I'm gonna try and catch up. Oh... So I have to stay. Oh, God. What do you want me to ask him? I don't know. Ask him if he's married? And ask him... Okay. Well...he'll bring me. - Are you married? - No, I'm not. Would you like something to... - No, thanks. - Nothing? Brought some menus. She wants to know what you do. Oh. Well, I, uh... again, that's sort of... I move money for people from one area to another. It's like being a broker. Do you have a car? Yes. What kind of car do you have? - What kind of car do I have? - Mm-hm. Well, I have a 4x4 Suburban - for off-road capabilities. - Mm-hm. And then I have a BMW. Oh, where do you live? Where do I live? Mm-hm. She wants to know where you live. I didn't see her lips move for that question. Where do I live? Do you want to come over and I'll show you both? No, no, no, she's just curious. - I live on the Upper West Side. - Mm-hm. Very old building. Distinguished. Good lobby. How old are you? Let me ask a question. How many babies does she want to have? - None. - None! Attagirl. So, you to speak English. - Yes. - Ah-ha! Well, that's a surprise. So, have I interrupted... Are you just friends? We're roommates. Roommates. Oh, that's equivalent to... - We live together. - You live together? I'm not interrupting or creating a huge ripple in your relationship by giving Anna a note, am I... Is it Francine or Felicity? Felicity. It's an unusual name. So, you think she looks like one of the Vermeers? Oh, no question. - The forehead. - Mm-hm. Uh-huh. The way she carries herself, that sort of shy look. What do you girls do? Do you know a lot about Vermeer? I know a bit. I know that there's eight major Vermeers here in town. Five at the Met and three at the Frick. Do you go there? I go to both places a lot. I really do enjoy...good paintings. And you give notes to all the women in the room? No. - I've never done that before. - Mm-hm. And how about you? Do you cruise the museum and look over your shoulder at strange men? I just, you know, I'm a tourist here, in a way, so I'm studying. No, I've never done that before. Never. Never. But, I have to say, the light was on you and the painting was beautiful and you were just as beautiful as the painting and before I left I just wanted to... - We should go. - Yeah, we have an appointment. So... Um... - Nice to meet you. - Well... Thank you for the flower. - Yeah, thank you for the flowers. - Am I going to hear from you again? - Anna? - I don't really know. - Well... - Do you have a number? I can write the number. I'm not going to call anyway, so... So it's all right if I call you, Anna? Well, what else are you gonna call her? Now, enjoy the flowers. - Bye. - Don't be cruel to my flowers. Oh, we'll try. We don't know. - Okay? - Oh, sure. - Anna, it is. Anna. - Yes. Would you like something to drink? Oh, yes. With pleasure. - What would you like? - A glass of wine? A glass of wine, we can do that. White? Okay? Uh, do you have red wine? Red, I can fix that up too. I don't like white wine. You don't? All right. Well, we'll do red, then. What about you, Felicity? Um... Probably... You have water. I'll have water. Water. Is that all, just water? Yeah, that's... Yeah. All right. We'll do water, then. Okay. In a minute. I'm gonna call the restaurant too. He's very stubborn. - You hungry? - Yes. Here we are. I called the restaurant, we're all square there. Here you go. Felicity. There's a napkin. And, for you. Your wine. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Now, then. I'd hoped we had a little chat here sometime today, Felicity. I got a rather disturbing phone call from my broker last night. He said you'd called him and that you're unhappy about some things. And he tried to explain to me what is disturbing you, but I don't get it and I thought we better find out about it and try to put things right. Well, uh, Dad, why don't we talk about... Anna's really not interested in hearing about all this. It's all this, like, financial family stuff. Let's just talk about it at some other time. Anna, you don't wanna... Dad. Anna, you don't wanna hear about it, do you? No. Well, I'm interested. I like finances. See, there you are. Anna finds it interesting. She finds it interesting because it is interesting. Point is, I'm interested. And that's why I think we ought to talk about it. Okay, if you want to talk about it... ..I do have a big problem with it. I have a big problem with you using me as a front for you. I mean, if it's your money, and I don't have any right to anything, then why do you put my name in it? Why do you involve me in it? I mean, you make me feel totally guilty. I think these are... I just think these are immoral things you do. I don't know what these offshore things are and I don't know what this... I don't know what any of these companies are. It's not fair to make me feel guilty all the time, about things that you want to invest in and if you want to invest in them, why don't you do it in your own name? Look, when I suggested we talk about it, I... I didn't think I was inviting an irrational harangue. It's not irrational. If you have something specific to object to, tell me about it. I have a whole lot of specific things and that's why I called Howard. I mean, there are a lot of things. I don't want to go... All right. Do you want to go into them or don't you want to go into them? Look here, if there's something that I can correct and it needs correcting, I will do it, just as I've done it all your life. Now, tell me specifically what you want me to do that I can correct or should be corrected. I want to either to give me... ..some real approval power over the things that are done in my name, or I want you to take my name off them. Without talking about specific investments, I'm not going to do that. In the second place, I'm not convinced that you really know anything about the investments that you have. And, in the third place, I don't think you're experienced enough or wise enough in the market to make judgments in that regard. So, so far, I'm going to have to say no to you. It's not often I do it, but this time I feel I have to. Now, shall we have some lunch or... ..shall we talk about something else? - You love it up here, don't you? - Mm. You look like little boy now. What's wrong? Do you need an ambulance? I hate it up here. It's like being dead. I was small enough and then you come up here and you see everybody small and far away. It's like being dropped off on your way to hell. Hell. I feel like should be waving goodbye. No, this place is... I can't stand looking at all of those people all at once. Ooh, the cries. Even up here, you can hear their stinking ambulances as one wounded ant gets carried to one wounded little hive where a bunch of worker ants are going to heal wounded ant until wounded ant is ready to walk on Ant Street again. Yuck. I'm sick of them all, the little bugs. And I'm sick of myself for even being worried about being dead when I look down on them from up here. I don't know how people could come up here for a thrill, it's disgusting. It's just too much. Yeah, but, I... I mean, we knew she was an opera singer. Well, we didn't know that she would practice two or three hours a day. I know, but, I just... I just... I can't stand it any more. Just do something! Just do... You're the one who owns the apartment, so just talk to her. I know. I know. I know. And she's a total slob. - Yeah, the kitchen, look at the kitchen. - All right. I'll talk to her, but... - I'm not gonna enjoy this. - I'll come with you. - Just go now. - She's gonna kill me! No, she's not. Just talk to her. Does she practice at her school and... - Great, she's gonna bite my head off. - I'll come with you. Better be there with a big Band-Aid. - Okay. - Just go. - Nicole? - Mm-hm? Can I talk to you about something for a second? - Sure. - Uh... Is there any way you could rehearse somewhere else, maybe? Sometimes. Or, all the time, actually. - Do you think? - Where do you suggest I rehearse? I don't know. Maybe a rehearsal studio or something, at school or... When I moved in, we had this arrangement, I could sing here. I... Yeah, I know. I just didn't know what it... what it meant. I mean, I thought it would just be a little you know, singing, but I didn't realise it was gonna be like this. I don't know, I feel really awkward about this, but I just... it's just really a lot... more than we expected. - Do you have anything to say? - No. I mean, it's not... No, it's my... It's not her... It's me. Well, I can tell you one thing, I really don't appreciate you two coming over here and ganging up on me like this. No, we're not. We're not ganging up. It's just... If there was a problem, I don't see why either of you couldn't have come to me at another time and told me. Well, I just... it's just a little awkward, that's all. I don't think there would have been a good time. I just... I mean, it's a couple of things. It's the singing and... you know, the kitchen's kind of always a mess and this watermelon all over the place, it's just... Okay, all right. Fine. Look, if you don't like my singing and my watermelon, then I'll leave! Oh, this is great. Oh, you're welcome! No problem! The sooner, the better. This is a key view. That's unbelievably great. It's completely ace that you can look up on a 10th floor and see something that looks like street level Europe. All it needs is some gargoyles. Although, I don't know, maybe the spirits can't make it up this high, the bad ones. But it's just like a European street, street level. You're walking along some Gothic little boulevard in Brussels or France. I know I love it. Some wine? I want to make a little proposition to you. Why don't you get rid of all of your friends? Make a phone call, call them up and just before you say goodbye to them, have them pack all of your stuff, and I'll send a car over. We'll pick it up and we'll get all of your crap into here, because I'll tell you something, I'm sick of this place looking so clean. Why don't you move in up here? Come on. We'll hide out. We won't tell anybody where we are. And this is it. I won't go to work. I won't go back into that craphole pit of God knows what. We'll stay up here and we'll just have a party. Come on! Party time. - What do you say? - Mm. Have you been back to the room? - Yes, I went there. - With our eternal ladies? Mm-hm. They are still waiting. - Yes. - For us...to go back. Do you think they have their own life? I think they do. I mean, it's unbelievable, the way Vermeer captures everything... in that little rectangle. I mean, those women are there forever. I mean, there's nothing as beautiful as those women, except... maybe... possibly... I think the way your neck over here meets your shoulders, and then this dress dips down... If it wasn't for those girls, I would have gone off the deep end a long time ago. 'Cause you know, I'm dealing with numbers all day long and I've had it. I'm just sitting there in the office watching numbers change, change, change, and I'm supposed to make money on knowing where the numbers are going to go next time. It's enough. I have had it. And if it wasn't for those girls, those paintings, being as eternal as they suggest themselves to be... I would have been gone. - Wine? - Oh. - Of course, wine. - With pleasure. Thank you. To it, to us. To them, to now. Is something wrong? I mean, I'm not the most sensitive man in the world, but... something's wrong. You've got a problem. What's the problem? You shouldn't have a problem. Is somebody bothering you? - I can make a call... - No. Is something bothering you? Because...I'll take care of it, if I can. What do you see in there? That you're a very generous man. I can be. I've helped a lot of people. Now, what's your problem? Tell me. Would you help me? I've told you I would help you. If you trust me and tell me what the problem is, I'll do my best to help you. Now, what is the problem? Tell me. It's my rent. Your rent? How much is your rent? I mean, you share an apartment with three girls, and I could help you out. How much is it? 3,000 - Your rent is $3,000? - Yes. You're three girls sharing a little shithole of an apartment... and that's going to cost $3,000? All right. You've got it. You want $3,000, I have it here. If that's what's going to make it better for you. I don't think I'm... ever gonna think out what I want to do. Here, at least. I want to go home. I want to go to France. I miss home. And I miss my boyfriend too. And if I stay here, maybe I'll be like all the other actresses... ..just wanting money. Can I come with you? Would that be all right? I can take you with me. Can't believe it. Where are we on this? I'm getting shmaised. I'm getting hammered. This is no good. What happened, man? You see what I see. Yeah. I know, we're getting hammered. This is disgusting. I can't believe it. Well, what do you want to do? You want to sit tight, you want to ride it out? I don't know whether it's going to... I don't know whether it's going to get any better, okay? I don't know I don't have an idea at this point. Everything is just like, forget it. Sit tight. Okay. You want to put a floor on it, what? What do you want to do? I don't know whether it's ever going to go anywhere but where it's going. The news is terrible. It's not my fault. I didn't know. They slipped that news in there. And there goes the rug, there goes the floor. We're in bad shape. All right, think about it, get back to me. I am dying a dog's death. What happened? I went in long on ATLX... - at 20. - Yeah? And she's diving. The news is terrible. There's news? There's bad news. There's bad news. It's a rapture. And I'm dying with it. I'll see what I can do. Hold on a moment. I got 25 Natoma. 25 Natomas. 25K Natomas at 16.5. Anyone picking it up? Anyone picking it up? No, I got no takers I got somebody at 25... at 2,500. No good, no good. You want to get rid of the whole thing. We don't want to be stuck with the rest. All right. All right. Maybe if it goes down a bit, we can move it. Okay. I'll get back to you. - So, that's two positions. - Want some lunch, man? No, I can't eat. What do you think, I can eat now? Make you feel better, you should eat something. Right? I want to feel better. Maybe if I get real mean and ugly. I'll be able to do something today. This is disgusting. Do what you got to do. - You eat. You eat for me. - All right. - And I'll die for your sins, okay? - Done deal. Don't worry, man. You'll be back. Yeah, well, that's it. I wanna come back. I wanna come back right here. Two or three incarnations later. Let me have one incarnation as a daisy and one as a snapping turtle. I'll pass on both. I'm getting hammered, baby, the nails are going into each hand. Now, I think one's going through my head. Anyone got an aspirin? Or something? I think you need more than an aspirin. I'm not going down on the street, that's for sure. Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying. Even been my board is dead. Same old, same old. Well, have you made up your mind? Listen, I don't think it makes a difference. I mean, it's fantasy, now. I mean, it's just numbers. I mean, there's nothing either of us can do. You know? Bring the soap. Bring the soap. All right, I'll sit. Oh, it's a machine! Pick it up, Anna. Anna, it's Mark. It's... 3:15 in the afternoon. I'm at the museum. I just left our room, the Vermeer room. I have no-one else to call. I just want to tell you... ..that I love you. I love you, Anna. I wish you were there. Pick it up. If you're there, pick it up. Oh! Telephone! Let's get it. Go back. Get it. No, come on, we'll call from the airport. Why not, we have time. Two minutes. We get it. No, come on, we're gonna miss it! Give me the keys. Why?! Who could it be? I don't know, but it's the last one. It's always important, the last phone call. Oh, you're so superstitious! We're gonna miss it. No, we just have two minutes to get a phone call. Hello? Anna, it's Mark. It's... 3:15 in the afternoon. I'm at the museum. I just left our room, the Vermeer room. "He was dead. "Permanently dead? Who shall say?" "Certainly, our experiments in spiritualism "prove no more than the dogmas of religion "that the soul survives death." "All that we can say is that everything is arranged in this life "as though we entered it carrying the burden of obligations "contracted in a former life." "There is no reason inherent in the conditions of life on this earth "that can make us consider ourselves obliged to do good, "to be fastidious, "to be polite, even." "Nor make the talented artist consider himself obliged "to begin over again a score of times a piece of work, "the admiration aroused by which will matter little "to his body devoured by worms." "Like the patch of yellow wall painted with so much knowledge and skill "by an artist who must forever remain unknown "and is barely identified under the name Vermeer."
