On October 31, 1988, 10-year-old Robert Maxwell attended a classmates Halloween party. Several of the children there tormented Robert, giving him a panic attack. His nose began to bleed uncontrollably. Confused and scared, he ran out the house as children chased him deep into the neighboring woods known as Diablo's Den. That night, eight children returned but Robert did not. Through the following weeks, a Fall Creek Valley search party scoured the woods, but he was never found. As the years passed, many claimed to see the ghost of Robert wandering the streets on Halloween night. Still wearing his costume leaving a crimson trail from his bleeding nose. Thus began the urban legend of Bloody Bobby. I just want this all to go away. I know. Maybe this could be kind of therapeutic for you to talk about all of this. You're not gonna spin this around? No I won't, Alex. I'm a journalist too you know. I've seen it all and I know when I'm being duped. I'm not gonna dupe you. This... This is the biggest tragedy in the history of Fall Creek Valley. It's not gonna go away. You know, maybe I could write my own story huh? That way it wouldn't have all the lies that other people would put into it. Yeah I don't think you could be very objective about it. It doesn't matter anyway. People are gonna take away from this whatever they want. I could say whatever I want to say and you could write whatever you want. It's not gonna stop it from becoming some twisted urban legend. Parents are gonna find their kids in the dark chanting. As if they're trying to channel his spirit. Bring him back to life. They're gonna hear their kids whispering, Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Ooh! That was like shaving my fuzzy man-purse with a switchblade! Hardcore! My body is shakin' and my head is quakin' after that skull-pounding number from Jetset Rejects. If you can't get enough from that band, you can catch them tomorrow night at our Annual Hallow-Scream Creepshow. Rumor has it that lead singer Mike Scott will be judging the costume contest. First prize for Best Male Costume is 5,000 big ones. First prize for the ladies is a night alone with Mike Scott himself. Now we've been dropping clues all week for the secret location of this annual rock fest. Last clue for you comes tomorrow at two o'clock sharp. Your last chance for this devlishly-rockin good time brought to you by 101.6. Okay, listen, I know we've been to Hallow-Scream for the past last like 20 years but I am so giddy I want to pee in my pants! No seriously we are gonna have the best costumes. They are gonna kick so much ass! Costumes? What costumes? I wanted to surprise you. You're gonna be He-Man and I am gonna be She-Ra! Uh! Oh great a shitty gay-ass cartoon from the 80s! Cool! I can't believe you just said that! She-ra was my idol! Aw man that show was propaganda. It was a gay recruitment cartoon. Here we go. Aw don't give me that. Alright, look, gay guys can't reproduce right? Alright, look, you got He-man. This buffed up hunk protector of the universe. But what's his true identity? Prince Adam. Boring, pale-faced, purple-wearing sissy bitch. Even his pet is a fucking pussy! I'm not saying that because its a cat. Like it's all scared and shit all the time. So then you got Prince Adam who wields his mighty magic sword and bam! By the Honor of Grayskull! Aw fuck that for the Honor of Grayskull shit. That was She-ra's thing. He-man said, "By the power of Gray..." "By the Power of Grayskull." "I have the Power!" Oh, yeah, so you know a lot about He-man for someone who doesn't really like the show. So, anyway, after Prince Adam gets the power, he transforms into He-man. Tan. Deep voice. Shirtless with furry pants on. Mm-hmm. He was the inspiration for male strippers for the next 30 years! Oh so what you are saying is you think He-man was sexy. No, I never said sexy. I said He-man was gay. Pay attention. Look at all the other characters from Masters of the Universe. Man-at-Arms. Gay. Merman. Gay. Beastman. Totally gay. I mean Fisto. Fisto? Supergay! One million percent gay! Alright then so all these buffed-up homoerotic men spend all their time fighting for Grayskull. And do you know what the Castle of Grayskull truly was? An All Man's Clubhouse. No bitches allowed. Sorry, women. It's as simple as this. Gay guys cannot reproduce. So they have to recruit. So they make this awesome cartoon filled with tons of gay overtones to recruit future members to join the Gay Alliance later on down the road. And I'm not being homophobic either. Just simple science. Recruit or die off. Don't give me that shit. Yeah, I hardly think it works like that. I actually think that's the dumbest thing that's ever come out of your mouth. And, believe me, I've heard some dumb shit. Hey, you're going the wrong way. It's a shortcut. Over my dead body. What was that? It's nothing. You okay? Yeah. No, no, no stay in the car! Okay? I've gotta check it out. What? What, what? We hit a pumpkin! What the fuck? Some asshole left a pumpkin in the middle of the road. Fuckin' up my rig! Ash, just get back in the car, okay? Let's just go! I gotta check this shit out! This is bullshit! I'm calling a tow truck! Hello? Don't go too far. Take this. Thank you. Ash! What do we have? I'm not sure but I bet we'll find more answers down there. Been down there yet? No, not yet. I wanted to get this scene all squared away first. So the vehicle is registered to Ash Simpson. There's a lot of cash left in the car so we can rule out robbery. And based on this driver's license that I found? That is Crystal Cochran. No signs of Ash Simpson. Did you find anything else? Another gutless corpse in Diablo's Den! Reggie, it stinks in here! What happened to your face? What, I just woke up? Just get in the shower I can smell you from here. Gross! Gross! Gross! Blehh! Hey, Oswald! There she is! Where are you, in a hotel room? Oh, yeah, I'm in my cousin's room. The bum just woke up. He's taking a shower right now. Oh, so what you're saying is you have a few minutes alone? Oswald! I only have like two minutes! That's all I need, baby! Aaahhh! Oswald! Your lunch is ready! Okay! In a minute, Ma! Sorry about that. So I can't finally wait to see you tonight in person! This meeting? Long overdue! Mmm-hmm. My heart is beating faster just thinking about it! Mine too, cowboy! Mine too! Nice! Uh, how do these smell? Ohh! Um! Eww! You know what? If you need a second opinion the answer is no! Eww! Oh, God! Hey, did you see that email from Alex? Uh, what? It looks like he finally made it back into the States. He's gonna be here tomorrow morning. It's about time. Are you decent yet? Yeah. You know you could've stayed with me. I have a whole three bedroom house to myself now. Um, aside from the fact that Grandma might be haunting the place, I really don't want to hear you having cybersex with your internet boyfriend. Oh my God, that only happened like one time and it was purely by accident. How does cybersex become accidental? Maybe I've accidentally had cybersex and just don't know it. Anyway I'm gonna meet up with him tonight for the first time ever. Yeah, we're going to this big Halloween party. Hey, you should come! You know what? It's actually at your old house! Huh? Yeah Willy Anderson bought your old house like six months ago! You said he was in Wall Street, New York. Doing that Wall Street stuff. Yeah, I guess he like tried to screw his boss's daughter or assistant or something like that. So he totally got fired for sexual harassment. So he's back in good ol' Fall Creek Valley again for a fresh start! Hmm, I think I'd rather have dull pencils just shoved directly into my eyeballs then actually hang out with Willy Anderson again. That kid used to kick my ass everyday in school! Oh my God, Reggie. It's been like 20 years. Get over it! Hey, you know a lot of our friends are gonna be there too. Like Erica? Your wallet is right here, genius. Oh, thanks. Erica is actually getting married to Jebediah Osborn. Is that the Preacher's Son? Mm-hmm. Totally turned her life around. Turned to God and now she's marrying the Son of a Preacher Man! Wow. Oh and I believe Madison is also gonna be there tonight. Really? Well maybe I'm not really doing anything tonight. Maybe I'll go with you. Yay, you're coming! You're coming! Yay, goodie! I'm so excited! You can meet my new internet boyfriend, Oswald. Oswald Jeffrey Gacy. Hm! You realize that sounds like a serial killer name, right? Why does everybody keep saying that? You have to remember to chew, Deputy. Sorry. My first meal of the day. We had a pretty early call this morning. Are people getting teepeed already? Not exactly. The Sheriff and I, we were up at Diablo's... Whoa, whoa, whoa. We found some graffiti. Hmm. And that's it. Unless the bottomless pit here wants something else. No, I'm good. Never ever say Diablo's Den again, okay? Okay. It'll be 14.26. Thank you, Sheriff. Sure. Actually, Sheriff, can I holler at you real quick for a second? Um, early this morning I saw some kid crawl over my fence into my yard. And I'm pretty sure it's Missy Waters' kid. Ya see, he wasn't too keen about me uh bangin' his Mom a couple months back. I mean, we had some really good times together. You know but then she tried to get all serious with me and everything. And actually between you and I, it would be a disservice to all the ladies in Fall Creek Valley if I settle down. So I dropped her. And then she just kept calling me up, you know, cryin' on the phone. "Can we work things out?" Then I hear her Son back there sayin' shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened this morning? Oh, oh um, shit, nothin' out of the ordinary. I mean other than that little punk tresspassin'! Alright. I'll keep an eye out. Thanks, Sheriff! You were saying you found something down in the Den? No, you know what? I really can't say where we were because I still don't know the area all that well. But I could use someone to really show me around town. Hey, order up! Be right back. Mind if I join you, Deputy? Ahh. The Sheriff is right. This town gets a little anxious at the mention of Diablo's Den. Especially her. She's spent the last 20 some-odd years trying to forget about that place. Excuse me? I know you and the Sheriff found something down in Diablo's Den this morning. I don't know what you're talkin... Don't deny it, Son. It may be just a little graffiti. But I know why the Sheriff wants it kept a secret. And why is that Mister? Granger. Horace Granger. You'll get to know me. I own Granger's Pub off of Harvest Way. It ain't graffiti that the Sheriff wants to keep quiet about. It's the location. Ah! Doctor Nolan! Meet our new Deputy. Nice to meet you. Please join us. She's doing a story on Diablo's Den. Do you mind if I take some notes? Go ahead. Thank you. You see Diablo's Den is older than the town of Fall Creek Valley. Some say it's haunted. Some believe it is a gateway to Hell. Either way, everyone steers clear of that place. Why? You didn't feel anything while you were out there? Something unnatural? Something unexplained? Maybe even a little evil? You mentioned Madison. What does she want to forget? Some bad things happened out there over the years. It started when she was a kid. A 10-year-old boy, Bobby Maxwell, went missing on Halloween night 1988. He went to a party and never came home. The whole town was in a frenzy looking for him but no trace of the boy was ever found. What does that have to do with Diablo's Den? Ah! About two months after his disappearance, some kid came forward with information about what happened that night. Said a group of kids from the party taunted and chased Bobby into the woods. Bobby fell down into the ravine that overlooks the highway and was hit by a car. And they never found the body? No. Like I said, no trace of him anywhere. Not in the woods. On the highway. Nowhere. The only thing that showed up was a tattered old comic book with his name on it found in Diablo's Den. Some think the evil in Diablo's Den just swallowed him up. This Bobby. Is he one of Madison's friends? No. No. The kid who came forward said that she was one of the kids chasing Bobby. Deputy. Have a great day. I have a feeling it's going to be one helluva night. Shall we? Nice to meet you. So are you gonna lick the plate clean too? No, I've still gotta have my protein shake. - Do I owe you anything or... - No. Did the Sheriff take care of it all? No, he took care of it. That really isn't necessary, Deputy. Please. Call me Trevor. Thank you. Whew! Kind of a boring town. Keeps you pretty busy. And? Bobby Maxwell is kin to me. I never did get over his death. That's why I stay in Fall Creek Valley to find closure. Can you hear voices? Sometimes. How about right now? Now? It's the quiet before the storm. Service! Hello? Who's working here these days? You'll see. Oh my God! Reggie?! Oh my God, I haven't seen you in like I don't know, like, 20 years? Hello? Could we order now? God, why does the service always suck around here? Very funny, Tiffany. What can I get you guys? Coffee. - Black as midnight on a... - Black like your soul. Uh, yeah. I'll have a grande no foam soy latte at exactly 130 degrees please. Okay. So two coffees at whatever temperature I damn well choose to serve them at! And I'll go get those while you guys take a look at the menus. What the fuck, Madison? I can't hear my customers. The clues, woman, I need to hear the clues! Begins in just a few hours. The last and final clue as to its secret location: "Halloween is no time for pencils and books "but time to raise Hell with devils and ghouls." Ooh, now that is the easiest of them all! Tonight is the night to rock out with your cock out if you got one, if not then jam out with your clam out! Brought to you by 101.6, The RAWK. Are you guys ready to order? I want the chocolate chip pancakes. Ooh, those sound so good right now! I haven't had those since I was 10! You guys, we don't have those on the menu anymore. Come on! Arrggh. Okay, let me see what kind of influence I have on the big guy. I'll be right back. Wow this place is like a time capsule. Yeah that's kind of why I wanted to bring you here. I am so sorry about that, guys. Big Dick McGee has been like all week crazy about the clues for that Hallow-Scream Party. Oh, tell him to try the Riverdale University campus. Okay. No shit, really? Well, I mean, that's based on the last clue. Um, the DJ mentioned books, pencils, and partying with devils. And I know that the Riverdale University mascot is a crimson devil. So that's just my guess. So, any chance I'll be seeing you there tonight? Um, no, actually we already have plans. Madison, Reggie wants to go with us to the party at Will's tonight. Oh, yeah? Oh I was invited to that party! Maybe I'll stop in for a few. Wow, I thought Liz was into girls now but I think she's got a thing for you, Reggie. Hmm. Anyways, I'll make sure to pass on the message. With any luck, this will be the first year he'll actually go to the party. So, hey, what time can I stop by for my Halloween costume? I'll be home by Four. Okay, cool. Four. Well I'll stop by then and, girl, can I just say I am so glad that you're coming out with us tonight. I mean it's about time you finally got over your prudish ways. Whatever. I am so not a prude. I had a kid out of wedlock. Oh, yeah, I guess you just got your sluttiness on a little bit too early. But, hey, oh my God, guess what? My guy is coming tonight. Oswald, my internet guy? Uh, Mask Guy! What? Mask? Who is this Mask Guy? Well, if you must know, when me and Oswald first started chatting, we would wear masks. We just thought it would help us open up a bit more if we could preserve the anonymity. Mm-hmm. Wow. Tiffany, you just keep finding yourself in weirder and weirder situations. Wait. Were you two wearing masks when you were having the... You know. None of your business! Okay, it's not what you wanted but it's free, it's on the house. You got the clue right! What? Like I said, I like that guy! Look, that's fine. Just bring her back tomorrow at nine. I just got home from work. I don't have time for this! Hi, come in. Listen, I have guests. I have to go. Sorry about that, guys. Penny is with her Dad tonight. Is this her? Yup! That's my little girl. Wow. She's looks exactly like you did when we were that age. Tiffany, darlin', Oswald just told me he's gonna be there at eight! Oh, Madison, that is fabulous! - You like it? - Mm-hmm! Alright. Who made these masks? Uh, Penny did. Yeah, isn't she a neat kid? You know what? She made those in Mrs. Johnson's class. - Really? - Yeah! That old bat is still alive? Yeah! Who says Old Bat anymore? I do, Tiffany. Wasn't she like 50 or 100 when we had her? No, I think she was in her thirties. Yeah, you're probably right. She was probably only, only looked 50. Old Mrs. J still has her Halloween mask designing contest, huh? Yup. She sure does. Remember when we had ours? Yeah, you made the Elephant Man. Come on! It was horrible! It was supposed to be Michael Jackson. Whatever. Alex got second place. I think I got third place. Who got first place? As if anybody could forget huh? Bobby Maxwell. I totally got cheated. Cheated? Yeah I had Old Bat Johnson a couple years later and they weren't doing that mask contest anymore. Oh! It's Oswald! I am just gonna take this outside. Yeah, I guess getting divorced wasn't all that bad. I got rid of a scumbag and I got this beautiful house and three full-time jobs. Three jobs? Yeah. Wow. Anyways, I want to hear all about you and the last 20 years. Um, nah, it's, you don't want to hear it. It's not pretty. Come on. It can't all be that bad. Mostly. You know, when we left Fall Creek Valley I was labeled the troubled kid. And I guess I just kind of kept up with that label ever since. So 20 years of straight trouble? Yeah and I've been okay the past three years. You know, I've just been kind of laying low and staying clean. What Tiff, she, Tiffany, hasn't told you about her deadbeat cousin yet? Stop it. She would never call you a deadbeat. And believe it or not, she's very fond of you. She might be getting me confused with Alex. No, she has nice things to say about you both so stop it. She said that you have your own commercial painting company? That's actually Alex's and I, you know, I sometimes kind of manage it when he's away playing journalist. Yeah, Tiffany said that he's in Africa. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's got this great story he's really excited about it. And he thinks he might win the Pulitzer. Wow. Yeah and then we got an email this morning, he's on his way to Fall Creek Valley, he should be here tomorrow sometime so we can go through the estate sale, you know, Grandma's estate sale. Well, it would be really nice to see him as well. - Is, do I have... - There's nothing on you. - Oh. - Am I staring? I'm staring! I'm staring. I'm sorry! It's just so weird! I can't believe that... I just can't believe that you're here! Standing in front of me in my house! You know, I never thought that I was ever gonna see you again. I mean nobody even knew your parents were thinking of moving. Just one day you don't show up to school. And then I went to your house and it was empty. Tiffany had no idea where you were. It was just like your parents upped and left and didn't look back. Okay, we have got to get out of here. I have so much to do to get ready for the party tonight. Well, I guess we're going. Yeah I have some really important emails to check. I will see you there. You better not weasel out of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I am gonna go start the car so if you're not there in 30 seconds I'm leaving. I guess I'll see you tonight. You can tell me about your past 20 years, huh? Yeah. It was really good seeing you. I missed you. I'm sorry, little guy. I don't have any candy this year. You could try going next door. I think they have some really cool chocolate. Are your parents with you? Do you speak English? Habla Espanol? What are you supposed to be? It looks familiar. Is it from a movie? Listen, kid, I don't have any candy. I'm really sorry. I can give you an apple. I don't know what to tell you. Try the neighbors. I'm sure there's gonna be houses that have candy. Okay? Happy Halloween! You've had your fun! Now get the hell out of here! Boop Boop Boop. I see you. Oh yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Hey! klaatu barada nikto Hmm, the Devil! El Diablo! Ha ha ha! Okay hmm mum murm. Uh, you listen to me. Fall Creek Valley. I'm El Diablo! I'm a horny devil! Oh, Madison! Titty titty titty titty titty! Oh give it to me, Madison! Great! It's all your fault! Trick or treat! Oh Jesus, Tiff. What has the bastard done with the place? I'm not. It's... It looks way different than it used to before. Oh my God, quit stalling Reggie. There's gonna be lots of people in there that you know. I have to find Madison real fast to get my phone 'cause I just know Oswald's been texting me like a madman! Come on! So then I said, "B cup not C cup!" Whoa! Tiffy baby! You are lookin' smokin' tonight. Give us a twirl. Thanks, Madison made this costume for me. Is she here by the way? Uh! Who is the man who's lucky enough to be your date? You remember Reggie, my cousin? Oh! Whoa! Dude! I haven't seen you in a minute! Oh! Jeez, the last time I saw you... You were shoving my head in a toilet. Well that couldn't have been the very last time I saw you? That was actually the incident that made my family move out of Fall Creek Valley. Uh. Wow! I mean, it was a long time ago, we we were all kids then. We're all grown up now, mature. Let bygones be bygones. Come on, let's get some brews! Yeah come on, Reggie! Ah, only the finest! Pacifico Clara! Eh! I'm alright, actually. Do you want a beer? Do you want to pick that up too when you're done? Just kiddin', man! Thanks, Willy. Oh, it's Will now. It's more manly. Yeah, yeah ladies seem to like it better. By the way, did I tell you that you are lookin' smokin' tonight? Yes, you did and where is your wife by the way? All the way in Nevada. With the kids. Parents' house. Hmm so is that why you're not wearing your wedding ring? Nah, the ring didn't really go with the costume. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah so I have to find Madison really bad and get my phone. Come on, Reggie. Um, yeah, cell phones suck! I thought you said he wasn't all that bad. He's a bigger jerk now than when he was 10! Uh, you just have to catch him on the right day and, believe me, that macho attitude of his is definitely compensating for something. I don't even want to know how you know that. No, you probably don't! Arrgh! As long as he has a big fat... Yeah. Sausages are great! I wanna bite it! Ooh! Who is this hot ma ma ma? Hey, Erica! Hey, you know Reggie, right? Hey, hey. Girl! Whoa! Girl, you look so hot right now! Get a picture of us! Hi! And to think that you are the wife of a Preacher's Son. Correction. Engaged. But I do not want to think about that right now. I am so tired of being the old Church lady. Tonight I let loose. Ohh! Drink another beer! Drink, drink! Is he really Big Dick McGee. Bring that big dick over here. Oh, I love that Big Dick McGee! Well! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Rick. The party has just arrived! What is up, Tiff?! Nothing. Hey, you know Reggie! Holy, Re, what? Our Reggie Reggie? Dude! Shit, it's been like 20 years! God, dude! What's up man? Wow! And Tiff, I am sorry Tiff, you are just looking absolutely stunning in that, girl. - Looking fabulous! - Hey, Rick! Like my costume? Oh! Well, yes, I do Erica. You look good. Hmm. You look real good. You always look good! But tonight you look downright yummy! I'm sure that's just that beer right there talking, huh? If it wasn't that one, it might have been the six I had before it though. Hey! Rick, Reggie. Remember, Rick. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was just talking to him. Dude, seriously, man, how the hell you been, bro? Uh, good I suppose, how are you? Aw, shit, man. I'm cool, cool, man, I'm cool. I'm still stuck here in Fall Creek Valley but other than that I can't complain, you know. Ugh, I hate to interrupt this little love fest but has anybody seen Madison? Nope, she probably bailed out on us. She is not fun since she left Robbie. Yeah, whatever. Tonight we have bait! Erica! Snap, it's all right! We might have to just go ahead and get you another drink. I mean, I know of a special little cocktail recipe that I know you'll enjoy! Oh! I want to catch up with Reggie. See what life has handed to him. See if it's been any better than the rest of us who stayed back in Fall Creek Valley to rot. Who's rotting girl? You just got engaged. Shh! Tonight I am a single lady! Tomorrow when I wake up, I'll go back to being the soon to be Wife of a Preacher. Well then, on that note, how about we go get you that drink? And we'll catch up with Reg and Tiff in a little bit? Come on, I know where Will hides the good tequila. I wanna dance! You know what? I better go get that girl. Something tells me that someone is gonna have to help hold her hair back later on tonight. So, dude, seriously, it was great seeing you again, man. We'll catch up later, alright? Tiff! Oh my gosh, she is such a hot mess right now! Hey, are you okay, Reggie? I'm just... I'm just a little anxious. I just keep seeing these people that I haven't seen since I left. Hey, I know just what you need. Come on! Come with me. So okay, so then the dog said, fur not furbie! I happen to know of a secret stash that William keeps out here. And I think it will be just the thing to calm those nerves of yours. Oh, let's see, here it is. Here. I thought you were desperate to find Maddie. I am, I am, I just I need something to calm my nerves real quick. Wow, you really are nervous about meeting Oswald, huh? Yeah, I actually really like him, Reggie. What do you really know about this guy? I know you don't take it seriously 'cause we met online and everything but we've really talked a lot. We've really kind of connected and shown each other our souls. By souls do you mean genitals? Oh my God, Reggie! I'm trying to have a moment with you here. Do you want to walk down to Madison's with me? Is it cool if I just hang out here? I just, I don't know, I just need some alone time. It's cool. Well, I will be back with Madison so don't go anywhere. I'll be right here. This is Sheriff Leavitt. We got an abandoned vehicle at Borden Pass. A gold Impala. California plates. Alpha Romeo One Two Zero Charlie. That gold Impala is registered under the name of Reggie Griffin. Come on, Madison, I know you're in there! I really need to get my phone! Madison? Maddy, I think I left my phone over here. Ugh! Oswald's probably been calling me nonstop. Come on, Madison, you promised you'd go to Will's party! Huh?! Okay ha-ha, Madison! This isn't funny anymore. I didn't spill a drop! Where are we going? Hey, guys! Did you hear that? I didn't hear anything. I must be hearing things. I thought I heard a kid. All your focus right now. Needs to be right here on me. In the love shack! Are you trying to seduce me? Hmm. Did you hear that? I think someone's out there. You know what? Just fuck me. Oh! Can't you just... Can't you just go scope it out? I'm serious. I just, I won't be comfortable if I know someone's right there. Come on, you know my situation. Can you just. Can you just please, please try, please? Alright. - Alright. - Come on. You'll still be ready when I get back? I guess I'll have to keep myself warm won't I? Don't be too long. I won't be. Sexy. Hello? Hello? Somebody there? Rick? Hello? Ugh! Ugh! Huh! The fuck was that? Holy shit, you're bleeding! No shit! I think it's... I think... I think it's him. I think it's him! Him, who?! He's getting up! Hey, man. Hey. Can I borrow your lighter? Hey! The fuck you guys doin' out here? Not smoking marijuana, are you? I'm just kiddin', man! Ha! Actually this is a safe spot. You know, I have a hidden stash out here. I kinda, you know, get away from the ole ball and chain. Get my smoke on. Hey, let me hit that. Suck on this little testicle you got for a pipe. You alright, man? Hey! I just got a headache. That's all. Try some of this, it'll make you feel better. I'm good. Oh, you're okay. You're not seeing what I am seeing, dumb ass. Anyway, actually I appreciate it, I have to go take a piss. See you asswipes on the flip side, huh? I'm really nervous. I'm meeting a lady friend here tonight. A chick I met online. What did you say your name was? I didn't. Oswald. Reggie. Yeah, don't worry, I'm sure you'll hear from her soon. Reggie, huh? Mm-hmm. That is a name you don't hear everyday. You wouldn't happen to be Tiffany's cousin Reggie would you? Mm-hmm. Shit, man! That's who I'm here to meet! Ya don't say? Yeah, Tiff Tiff will be here soon. Oh, man, what a small world. You know, I was hopin' I would get to meet you sooner or later. I have been doing some research and trying to get in touch with you. And then it turns out you are the cousin of the girl I am chatting with online. It is great to finally meet you! Why would you want to meet me? I do an internet show and wanted to do a couple segments about you. I just think you are an interesting cat and I want to know more about you, Reggie Griffin. You know, actually, I think I need to go inside. I think I need to take a piss. Uh, yeah, yeah, man. Hey, hey, maybe we should re-up on brews! You know, you can tell me about yourself you know? Like hobbies? Favorite foods? What your childhood was like? You know what? I don't think Tiffany is gonna be coming by tonight. I think she said she's gonna be sick. What? Dude! Fuck! What's up with the line, I gotta piss like a racehorse! Really, Will? You throw a party and you only have one working toilet? Okay, first of all, the contractors told me that the remodeling would be done like two weeks ago. And I paid those fucktards the money and now I haven't seen them since! Second of all, there's a big gaping hole in the bathroom upstairs. Ooh, boo-hoo, sob story. It still sucks though. Slutty Bumble Bee has been in there for what seems like an eternity! Tell that bitch ass to hurry up and get out of there! Sometimes you just gotta put them in their place! They're called women, Will. We aren't just one of your bros. You can't talk like that in front of a lady. Mmm-mmm. Okay, first of all, I don't consider you two tuna cans ladies. Second of all don't you, you know, go fishing on each other? We're gay, yes, but we're still considered women. Right. Lezbo Liz. Lez lesbian Liz. Liz Lizbo and her muff-diving sidekick, Dykey Deli. Thank you, thank you for reminding me why I prefer women. I really have to pee! I'm tempted to go water those rosebushes outside your house. You are not pissing in my yard. Why not? All the guys have been. What? Who the fuck did that? You know what, I'm gonna handle this. Oh! Hey! Why don't you snap that turd off and get outta here? Huh? There are people like getting angry out here trying to get in there! Will! Do you always have to be such a douchebag?! Douche your bag. Uh! What?! My house my rules. I don't wait for nobody. Fuck you, Will! Hey! Knock it off out there! You're going to scare the piss back in! You're such a fuckin' jerk, Will. I'm going to go piss in the middle of your front lawn! Yeah I dare ya, Lizbo. I hope when you're crouching out there a lesbian bug flies up your cooch! You two will be very happy together! Eat shit, Will! I'm gonna go in your bedroom and piss on your pillows instead! Oh, yeah, try it, rugmuncher. You don't think I didn't lock the door to the bedroom? Get the fuck out! Hi! You, don't you work at the diner? Yeah, that's right, handsome. I never did catch your name this afternoon. Reggie. Hey, Liz. Nice to meet you, Reggie. Nice meet you. I'm Deli. Liz's girlfriend. Uh, let me guess. Let me guess. Ladybug? Lumberjack! Whatta dick! She wasn't wearing a costume! Oh! I didn't mean anything by it. I'm sorry. Naw, don't worry about it. She's just PMS-ing. Makes me wanna go back to men again. So, is this still the only bathroom in the house? Yeah, I've been waiting here forever. Then Will cut in front of me. Been in there like 10 minutes now. Knowing him he's doing hand-to-gland combat while dreaming of Deli. He's such a jerk! Hurry up, Will! The line has tripled since you've gone in there! Will! Goddammit! You know, I used to live in this house. And the door is a little, there's a little trick with it. I could get us in there if you wanted to get back at him, we could open... Hell, yeah! What are you waiting for? Wait, Reggie, what is that? What's what? I think it's blood. Whoa! Will! Someone should call the cops. 911, what's your emergency? I'm at this party. And someone is dead outside. Huh! Please, let me go! I remember you. You're Bobby Maxwell! Madison! Reggie! Argh! Madison. No! Maddy! Freeze! Reggie, you're done! What happened tonight? I stabbed him. He was right there. Who did you stab? Bobby Maxwell, he, he came back and killed Tiffany. Bobby Maxwell? I guess the next thing you are gonna tell us is that Bobby Maxwell also killed the man we found in the trunk of your car. What? Don't play innocent, Reggie. The man's name was Ash Simpson. You killed him, his girlfriend Crystal Cochran, and everybody else tonight. No. No. It was Bobby Maxwell. He killed Tiffany, Madison, Erica and Will. I saw their bodies. You forgot about Rick? Rick, too? Cut the crap. None of this was me. I didn't hurt anyone except Bobby. I stabbed him and he was right there. There is no Bobby Maxwell. Reggie, it was you. Is this some kind of twisted revenge thing? Are you still holding a grudge? No. You pathetic, pill poppin' piece of shit! I always knew you were no good. But I never ever thought you'd be capable of any of this. I'm not. It was Bobby Maxwell. It was all Bobby Maxwell. What are you doing here? I'm interested in a case. We got a situation. Those voices in your head, huh? They're not gonna help you anymore. You want this to be over tonight? Right now? Tell me the truth. I'm a Paranormal Forensic Investigator. I don't got time for this. I got cop shit to do. Every one of us was to blame. We were ruthless with the name-calling. The incessant bullying. You never fought back. You stayed to yourself and tried to hide in those comic books. We just kept after ya. You just stayed in those comic books. You deserve your revenge but no one deserved to die. Not like this. Get the fuck off my crime scene. I can't do that. It's too important. Just give me a few minutes. Talk to me. I think I can help. Everything that happened tonight wasn't caused by some little boy that went missing 20 years ago. It was you! You're responsible for everything. Sheriff. Can I see you for a minute? What is she doing here? I told her she needs to leave. But she won't stop with this ghost story shit. What the hell just happened here tonight? This is Glen Rossi with KVCB Channel Five News reporting to you live from Downtown Fall Creek Valley. We are interrupting your regular programming for a brief moment to report to you this heartbreaking story. Perhaps the biggest tragedy in the history of Fall Creek Valley. It is with a heavy heart to report that the bodies of eight local residents have been found at various locations around town. Here to comment is Sheriff Ryan Leavitt with more information. Sheriff, what can you reveal about these murders? Well, Glen, at this time, all of the events for the past 24 hours are under investigation. We have seven separate crime scenes. One suspect. A Reggie Griffin was taken into custody late last night. And you believe these murders could possibly be linked? Well, we explored the possibility of a connection between several of the murder victims and the disappearance of Bobby Maxwell. I see. And is the suspect still in custody? Unfortunately, Mr. Griffin died in custody early this morning. How did he die so suddenly? That's under investigation. So you still have yet to determine his cause of death? Glen, an autopsy is pending. Of course. So Sheriff, in conclusion, is there anything you'd like to say to the residents of Fall Creek Valley? To the citizens of Fall Creek Valley, remain calm. We are confident we found the person responsible for these horrible crimes. But remain vigilant. If you see anything suspicious call 911 immediately. In essence, if you see something, say something. In memorium of the victims of this terrible tragedy, there will be a candlelight vigil held tonight at sunset at the Fall Creek Valley Towne Center Hall. We will be bringing you more updates and information as it becomes available. This night will forever live in infamy as the night of the Fall Creek Valley Massacre. Waaaooo! That was an amazing, mind-altering Halloween night for the ages! The ghosts and ghouls rocked the halls as the demons and witches danced with the dead. Zombies and werewolves feasted on the flesh of the innocent and the Harvest Moon dripped with blood. 20 years of throwing this party. And without patting myself on the back too much, my freaks, I think yours truly raised the bar yet again. It was one wild and crazy night. I got a call that my twin brother is here. Reggie Griffin? Alex? Alex Griffin? Your nose is bleeding. Well, my Rockodiles, don't fear the reaper just yet 'cause even though tonight's festivities have reached the end, there's always next year. Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby! Bloody Bobby!
