MY LITTLE BUSINESS Mr. Lansi, excuse me, the check went this morning. - You like it? - Great terrace, my wife loves it. About 40 of us worked there, we noticed the boss got there before everyone. - Normal, he's the boss! - It was every day. With a buddy we decide to show up at 6 a.m., we follow him, he's going from an office to another. Know what he did? - What? - Sharpened pencils. He sharpened everyone's pencils, to the same size. 80 pencils sharpened mesured to size. - Who had two desserts? - I did! It's not included in the menu. He woke up at 6 to sharpen pencils! - Scary, huh? - Scary... So? He hung himself and the business closed. Isn't life beautiful? Come quick! Hurry! Get out, Yvan! Don't jerk around, damn it! Get out! Don't come in! The surface-planing machine's blown. Didn't look like it. The electrical circuit burned. Don't fiddle with the machines 'till the insurance comes. Marthe, can you find the insurance contract? Right there! My feet are soaked, why do firemen spray so much water? Answer the phone, I've had it... Lansi Company... Benjamin, I'm afraid your training's up. Yeah, I thought so. See this? Whatever one says, nothing's worth oak. It's real wood... resistant. For God's sake! It's like the Bronx here. 'Morning. Fuck, scary. Doesn't smell bad, smells like a fireplace. Do you know how it happened? No. Probably an overheated machine or a short-circuit, - anything, I don't know. - Could it be criminal? What do you mean? A volontary fire. I didn't start it, ok? A business hassle, a competitor, an asshole... Don't think so! - You must deal with assholes. - Yeah, but no. An lrish terrorist? They're very agitated in Belfast. Possibly a terrorist, but I'd rather go for an Arab. Could be, but Russian mafia shouldn't be overlooked. Did you see the cabinet in the office? It burned, everything burned. - What was in there? - Papers... Tax, VAT, all sorts of taxes. We already owe them a bundle. Don't worry, they know exactly what we owe. - Was this new too? - What do you think? - Telephone. - In your pocket, Marthe! Yes, I'll put him on. It's your wife... sort of. Yes Nath? Horrible... Does Christophe know? How'd he take it? I'll call him later. I'll put Sami on. How are you sweets? Guess what? We could see the smoke from the school-yard. Yes, it's super burned, I'll tell you later. I'm on my way. Bread? See you. Yvan, I gotta go. If you need anything, don't hesitate. Good luck. We're going to need it. - What are you doing here? - Waiting for you. - Your father know you're here? - You crazy, 'course he does. You know your cousin. Yeah, I do. D'you know Christophe dad's biz flamed? "Christophe's dad", I know. You must be happy, you said he busted your balls. Not to the point of having his business burned. It's a figure of speech: you want to kill everyone. Have you? You crazy? My dad'll kill me! It's worse with my sister! Can't kid with girls. So? So? It's apocalypse now. What's apocalypse? - Hi Amin. - Hi Nath. How d'you find out? No Christophe, I don't want banana peels under your bed. You heard about your dad? - Can I watch TV? - Go ahead. Not too loud. You're okay though? - Is Amin sleeping over? - I can't kick him out. My cousin's an asshole! Don't worry, the scooter can wait 'till next year... Were there lots of firemen? Yeah, no kidding. Okay, dad. How was Yvan? Bad. Three generations up in flames... This mess won't help his business. Nor ours. He's late with my alimony. I promised to lend Amin's father 1000 francs. Don't lend what you don't have! You should start working again. What about the reinsertion thing? I've been 3 times, the guy wants to reinsert me his own way! Lea? It's Yvan. You're not there? Maybe you're out of Paris. I had a few problems I wanted to talk about... maybe even have you console me. Not urgent, I'll call back. Big kiss... Is Sylvie there? Was that your daughter? You're with her tonight? To do what? To see each other. Don't worry. Call when you can. Big kiss. Hello Martine. Could you make me a pizza? With peppers. Have you had dinner? So make it for one. Thanks. It's the only place that didn't burn, other than the electric circuit. The roller-saw and ribbon were spared, the rest... What do we do now? You fill out the papers, I take them to the head office, they send an expert, he fills a report and if all agree they pay! - How long will it take? - Not long. How long's that? I don't know... two three months, max! I have a contract with a museum that's worth a fortune, Maxime. I bought wood that burned, ordered a machine I can't pay! If I lose this gig, it's over! Get it moving, ok? When your delivery boy fell and wasn't insured, I came through. I'm insured, it's not the same. I'll handle it, trust me. The damage list is in the office. - I would've rather typed it. - It's okay. It's all here. I'll have a look. Tell Louis I succeeded in lowering his trailer bonus. I'll tell him. - I'm counting on you! - Don't worry. Maxime's going to lower your trailer bonus. Logical, I use it in August. And the fire? It'll take a while, it's a drag. - Let's say you've finished. - I know. Hold on! Cancel the new machine. Montrel's on the phone. I thought we'd cancel, I told him. Here's Mr. Lansi. Montrel? It's Lansi. Yes, I'll get the insurance going. Your flat bonus also covers your son in case of accidents. If he skiis, rollers, or rides bikes... He's never gone skiing! He rides bikes? You'll be covered. So? So it burned, Lucie. It happens... It's rare! Jean-Michel, I have an urgent file to deal with, a fire. I won't call at your office. Call me or I'll drop by your house. See you later. Martine, how are you? Jean-Michel? Yes, he's dead. It was sudden, under the rain, at a crossing. Seems his legs were folded like a cangaroo's. Nice ofyou to come. How did you hear? Mom? Can you come, please? I'd better be going. Fuck! I've studied your file. I'll have the expert come in. Thanks. Where were you when the fire started? Here. Why? The expert will ask questions. So? So nothing. I have nothing to hide. I didn't say that... So why d'you ask? - I'm not asking. - That' s better. Where were you? The trunk's full, I couldn't. You found a way. Yeah. On this trunk! Where's Christophe? With a friend. How'd he do this? They did it. It was on the other side of the project. I think it's broken, see what you can do. Buy him a new one, I can't play taxi every day. I'll get him a new one. Only I'm a bit... I mortgaged the house. I didn't know. Couldn't give Nath alimony... She noticed. You too. Of course. You know guys who pay alimony to ex-wives who've started over? One doesn't "start over", one continues with changes. And I'm the change: state-employed, security! I do your hours twice. You love it! No other cares. No kidding. Listen Yvan, ifyou want your wife and kid back, take them. Discuss alimony with Nath, talk to her, I'm fed up... Hi Christophe. - You okay? - I'm okay. - Shall I close? - I'll do it. Get warm. You prickle. I'll fix your bike and be right there! Cookies are on the table! I eat FigDelis now. Things change. We said twice a week. My brothers are coughing bad, can't sleep in my room. Take Christophe's room, he's not here tonight. Who is it? Amin. Cigarette. One can never be alone. Bummer! You said it! Where d'you find that? Confiscated it from a student. None of this here! Fine, I'm going to get it now. None of that at home. The kids will get hooked on it. I told Yvan you'd go and speak to him. Why me? Why you? Why him? Shit, because it's about you! Yvan Lansi speaking. Is Maxime Nassieff there? When is he back? I'll try again. Can I talk to you? I'm all ears. I'm no longer 20, I can't be unemployed. I'm afraid this company won't make it. I've found a job at Leterrier's. It's a good company. I could hang in there until retirement. Sure... You know what, I'd do it if I were you. - Going to lunch? - And you? Take your time. We're not overloaded here. Catherine! You don't have to come every day. Sorry? I'd much rather if it's ok. I don't mind, but take a lunch break. Sorry? - Want something? - Thanks, I'm not hungry. It's Lansi again. Is Maxime there? I'll call back. Mr. Lansi's out. Is there a message? Who's calling? I'll tell him. What are you doing? Everyone's on my back, I'm fed up. How are you? Did your father's scale-model burn? Saved it by a hair. It's at home. Want to see? Hello, by the way. - It's all like this? - We cleaned a great deal. Wow! A real punch in the gut. Not only there. It took in some places and not in others. It happens that way. The fire spread through the electric wires. The trainee alerted us. He was next door. Strangely enough this little room was spared. The smell reminds me of something. It's not disagreable, reminds me of something. Fire-wood? Exactly! A minute later, the whole neighbourhood would've burned. Fire and wood marry well. Did you extend this side? Long time ago? A long time ago. It's like this everywhere? No, look... I thought of a short-circuit, traces of flames there. Don't, you'll get dirty. You tried to put the fire out alone? Burned my hair a little. - It's ok. - Show me... You can't tell... - You shouldn't have come. - I know. It's not right. It's not... Let me do that. - Got condoms? - No. Maybe in the office. Put one on. I'll touch myselfwhile waiting. Don't say that, I'll never go. I found one! I'll do it. It'll come back. Slowly. It's coming back. - I feel it... - It's really coming back. It's really back! - You ok? - Something's in my back. It's nothing, just a nail! This ok? I'm sorry. We shouldn't see each other. Why d'you come? I'll call you... Is Maxime there? When's the expert coming? - What's this? - A ribbon-saw. - It works? - It does. Was this fanlight open or not? I don't know. Lansi claim: notes. In the room adjoining the main workshop, a fanlight. Claimer declares he doesn't know if it was open or not. You lock up at lunch-time? Of course. - With a key. - You got it. Was... the door broken into? Outside or inside door? The workshop's. - Difficult to tell. They burned. - May I see? Over there. Oh yes, I see. At first examination, the main door, burned in the fire, seemed to carry proper regulation locks. Mind leaving me alone? I need to... Heavy duty, isn't he? No kidding. See what he's doing. I'm thinking ofVersailles wood. I lose over 50%, so... At Berthier's, you think? I'll try. Thanks. Sorry? The surface-planing machine can be saved. Great, but we have nothing to feed it with. I know. I'm almost finished repairing it. Good, fine. Hello Mrs. Masson. I have a broken machine... I may be a bit late. Tell me! You were lunching together? Why? Want to know what we ate? I'm trying to figure how it happened. If the company closes, it's "hello to the dole". For your boss, it's "hello to Mauritius." Are you filing claim or are you a cop? Are you done? - I need to... - Sure. I may be back. Try to think... What about that Mauritius stuff? Hesitating! Mauritius or Tahiti. Where would you go? Since that pencil story... Help me load and relax, and change this, doesn't keep the cold out. I ordered some at Marcellin's. I haven't paid his bills. See you later. What's the scoop? The fire looks clean to me. Machines are in order, the workers are pro, everyone was at lunch when it started. - What are you thinking? - Nothing. I know you. You're nodding. Something's fishy, I feel it. What are you doing? You tore my jacket! What are you looking for? - Checking something. - You done? Not really. Did Maxime send you? Yes... no. It's me. - Is it you or him? - It's me. I'll talk to Maxime tomorrow. I understand. Good night. Good night, get out! Is Mr. Nassieff in? He's out. My fingerprints for his so-called expert. What expert? Where's Mr. Nassieff? He went to a funeral. - A relative? - Don't know. Maybe. Where's the burial? Where's the burial? Who's this expert snooping at night? I'm listening! A sort of friend. Used to expertise. Was a cop. What the hell is this? I'll explain, l... Ifyou fuck me, I'll beat you so hard you'll forget your mother's name. I don't know her. What? I'm an orphan. I grew up in an orphanage. Fine. What's with my insurance? See that guy there? In the raincoat? - The one in the casket. - Not anymore. A collegue of mine. Passereau. Great guy, very smart. Didn't stop him from dying. He didn't take it into account. He would've let me know. Would you explain? He was at the Versailles lnsurances. I'm just a courtier, he registered contracts. So? So... Since he died... you're not really insured. Not insured? You've insured me for ten years! 50.000F a year. Why shouldn't I be? I never declared contracts, we kept the money. Say again? After the fire, I called him to register your contract, Iike we always did, but he was dead. Assholes! You're gonna die too! I'm going to kill you! We never let anyone down, he never died before. - Where's the money? - I only got 10%. Where's the 10%? You play poker, go with whores, do drugs? What's your thing? At the orphanage, I was one of the few with a name. Well... my father's name. I don't know how. Seems his name was Nassieff. An orphan with a name is rare. So I researched... In Russia, I found a datcha in that name, I bought it. It was in ruins. I rebuilt it. Cost a lot. All you have to do is sell your casbah. You have 2 weeks. - I can't. - Want to bet? It... didn't belong to the guy who sold it to me. It didn't? No. I bought air. The real owner got it back. I lost everything. That's Russia, changes all the time, it's crazy. I'm Russian. I'm going to tell the cops everything because I have nothing to loose. It's different for you, you'll go to jail. They'll get a kick out of the datcha. If I go to jail, you're not insured. And you'll never be reimbursed! I'll get you for this! I don't know how, but I will! Did you tell him where I was? Yes. What did I know? Shouldn't have done that. Shouldn't have done that. Put my wife on. My wife you mean. Yours too. She's out. Are you drunk? Put my son on. Is it a good idea? Fuck! Asshole! For fuck's sake! Open up! Did you see the time? How did you fix those contracts? He handled it, back-dated them. Do the same. I don't know... It's impossible! It's impossible I'm not insured. And it happened. So everything's possible! How am I going to do it? You'll shake your ass. - Where did the asshole work? - Respect the dead... Where did he work? At the Versailles office. Give me the Mercedes keys, I need an advance. Let me have the keys! I busted my car because of you. - Of me? - Yeah, you! My car's there. Now you own a station-wagon! Why the long face? Mr. Lansi, the taxman's here. Pierre Koechlin, taxman. I took the liberty of coming. 2 summons went unanswered. As you may notice, I've had some problems. I see. What are you going to do? I don't know. Mr. Lansi, you have a tax debt of... 287.876 francs. I lost everything in the fire. My wood, my machines. All gone. I can't deliver my clients, they don't pay. I don't earn. You're insured, Mr. Lansi. Aren't you? Of course. We could collect your debt on your reimbursement directly from your insurance company. If not? If not we'll seize your goods. Unless you pay something now. I have nothing. A symbolic sum to stop proceedings. Symbolic? A gesture! Of course. Mr. Lansi, please. Not the shirt, it's a gift. I can't accept that. You've got a week. You ok? I'm ok. Who was it? No one. A vulture. I won a week. Your shirt's hanging. What are you doing? I can't drive, the wheel's rubbing... My door wasn't wide enough. I've had an idea, I'll go to the main office, with the back-dated contract and I'll sneak it in. You can't, you have to go through the central computer. There's an access code. So do it. - I can't work computers. - Find someone. Find someone! My secretary Lucie could. There you go. She's a bit square, I do my deals alone. Let's go and talk to her. Now? Now. - No guarantees. - I'm used to that. You're asking me to swindle the company I've been in for 10 years? Swindling and jotting a number isn't the same. You think I'm dumb too. I don't think you're dumb, but if I file a complaint you'll sink with the agency. Unemployment's popular. Told you it wasn't easy. Now she knows everything. She's square but she's no spy. I know a girl in accounting, I'll see her tomorrow. The code's activated after lunch. Thanks Lucie. Thanks Lucie. You know the computers there? I have work to do. Please go. Lucie has work to do. Keep the pressure. The central computer's no easy task. What? I thought she was more... upright. I'm disappointed. I know the feeling. Funny, no? Why are you staring at me? I'm not. I don't like it when you stare. Company department? 3rd floor. Can I help? Got your bonus? Can I see you a minute? You've done climbing, right? Yeah, mostly speleology, why? If you had to climb a three storey building... what would you bring? What's this all about? I'm serious. You think you can climb three storeys just like that? I don't think anything, I'm asking for advice. You got a kid, I don't have the means to raise him without a penny. A piece of advice: get life insurance, but not from Maxime. I'm at a loss. I'm here. Tall, strong, a mountain pro. How did it go with Nath? As usual, we did it. Did what? Had a fight after five minutes. A real pain in the ass. No kidding. Call me. - Shoot some nets? - Nah. Nice Merc. Whose is it? Insurance downpayment. You ok? I'll call you. - Call me. - So long, son. See you tomorrow. Hello Mr. Granjean. I was just about to... Your check went today. No, no bother. What's the world's greatest lie? "Your check went today." Any van paint left? Somewhere in the stock-room. I told Leterrier yes for next month. If I found a solution, would you stay? We had an idea with Maxime. I told you I did time when I was young? No worry, they're administrative solutions. I know that kind of administration... if you need help. Thanks. You and Yvan hang out a lot. I won't be long. He needs help to move stuff... the fire, you know. He can't do it alone? It concerns us too. You're too nice. You noticed? You see? This... I like. I dig it! You're here again? There's a TV program. My dad won't let me watch. Which program? Don't know, I couldn't watch. Must be a good one. Ask Nath. - Not alone. - Go ahead. Where are you going? You the police? You've got mail. What about these grades? The teacher's over the top. What's going on? It's Dad's company and stuff. Perturbs me. I see. Did the school burn? Get a hold of yourself then. Good, we agree. You're annoying. - Got class tomorrow? - Gym. Great. Go in. Go in, ok! - You ok? - I'm ok. - Nice ofyou to come. - I know. There's bound to be an alarm. See one? Must be one on the other side, probably coded. Fuck, the cops. No panic, we're just two guys talking. Cops don't give a shit. Gentlemen, do you have a light? It's cold out tonight. Have a nice evening. - Crazy! - The code? On the other side. You're crazy! - Nath know about this? - Kidding? She'll kill us. It's for her too. You know her! She's a "legal-eagle". - I know. - What? What you mean. The code's here. What are you doing? Watch, I breathe on it. See where it doesn't stick? Traces of grease from fingers. Generally it's birthdates, or well-known war dates. That's it! - How d'you do that? - I just told you. I checked. Only offices all around. We'll be ok, the concierge doesn't sleep here nights. See that box on the 2nd floor? Must be the alarm. Shit! In offices, they always clean at night. We'll have to do it early a Sunday morning. - And the concierge? - Maxime will check. You wanted to climb alone? Well yeah... Well no. He breathes on the code, the grease stains are the right number. Or, covers the numbers on the right, punches left buttons, it works. He's good! Where d'you learn? In the projects. Never been to jail? Sports saved me. A true civil servant! Safe from the unexpected. Except these kinds of assholes. At the orphanage, what you wanted you stole. What was refused, you took. One thing mattered: how to screw them. I kept the reflex. That's over. I think they take better care of kids now. Think so? My son's an alien. I'm afraid to scare him, so I keep a distance. What's the plan? Alarms aren't my... I have an idea. And Lucie? Getting there! Slowly... Speed it up, it's the day after tomorrow. I'll visit the concierge tomorrow. Thanks for the vodka. You're still an asshole. I know. Louis'll go to Versailles with you. Stay if you like. Thanks, but I'd rather go. It's better. Sorry, I didn't know they were coming. If not? Maxime, you know what you are? Leave him alone. I'm glad you came. You're off to Mass? Which one? Two hours... very good. Thank you very much. The concierge replacement is a bit out of it. I bullshitted her a little... Must have been hard. She goes to Mass on Sunday morning. What time? Eight-thirty. That's great. At the orphanage we had to paint the dorm twice a year... Not again. I could have been a painter instead of an insurer. I shot this from the street. Can't see very well. From outside, it's the standard alarm. I don't know if it's electronic. I doubt the alarm is connected to the police. It's not a bank. You inject this in the box, blocks the alarm system. You've got 1 hour to work. - That's all? - As stupid as that. Come here for a second. Do you mind? I didn't cancel my job at Letterrier's. I'll see how your thing goes. When's it for? Tomorrow. - 'Night boss. - Put this on the desk. Looks terrible, it drips. Did I tell you about my childhood? I was 4, my father... You're lucky. Hi, it's Sylvie. Sylvie who? Silly! It's Saturday, I'm alone. I told myself... Told yourself what? What did I tell myself? See you later. Your fire's perturbing you? Maybe. Rather have dinner? What about you? - Frankly? - Yes! My daughter's with her dad once a week, so to have dinner... So no dinner! Oh shit! What? Had the runs all night. I had a terrible nightmare. - About what? - Getting caught. I'd rather have the runs! Lucie, for heaven's sake! We have to go! I can't do it. But you've prepared everything, you've been terrific. I'm incapable. Lucie, let me in now! How are you? You're not with Lucie? Where's Lucie? - She's not coming. - What? She's too scared. She wrote everything down, we'll follow directions. "1 : Push the button to start the computer." "2: Wait for little light to flash..." You're jerking me around! She won't come, I can't make her! Take me to the cops! Forget it! You go to the cops, I'm not insured, I don't give a fuck! I know someone who knows computers. So do you. For-get-it! What's up? Get up, your dad needs you. - Is it bad? - Not at all... just complicated. It's really complicated. It's too complicated, let's forget it! I'll make it. It's not worst than "Outcast". To enter 3rd level, you reprogram 1 st, see? We'll come and get you. Uncap it... He's great! Got the code? He didn't give it to you? Give me war names! - Stalingrad... - Dates! Like 14-18. 1515... 1917. 1968. No that's not a war. 1939-45! 39-45! - It's cool. - Good work. I'm going to get the kid! Come quick son! Any bathrooms? - It's not the moment. - I know, but... This way. End, right. Don't leave fingerprints. Where are you? 1st floor. Sami's in the bathroom! I need to go too. Could've thought of it before. - The toilet? - End, right. - Hurry! - Watch your fingerprints. - You need to pee? - No, but I could vomit. We should steal things, so it looks like a burglary. Otherwise they'll check the computers. Don't worry, I saw a painting in the manager's office. Fuck! I can't believe it! You there? Hurry, we got things to do! There's a problem! - No paper! - I can't believe it! What would you do on the Everest? I'd use snow. Find snow! He needs paper. Sorry... Anyone there? I'll look in the toilets upstairs. Great! Thanks. - Who is it? - Guess! You saved me! Hurry, hurry up! I've started the computer. Sit down. First enter the access code. - Where is it? - There! Good boy! Let's start! There's the painting. This floor's so loud, it's awful. Not suprising, it's not kept up. Terrible! - This is terrible too! - We can't steal a stapler. We can't steal this, it's not credible! - What are you doing? - Thinking what to steal. Let's not go over 3.5, they might get suspicious. You're the specialist. What about the suspensive guarantees? Tick "none". I'm coming. Can you register now? I have to go to the central clock... and change the time and date. You're doing well. Yvan! That's serious. No, it's ugly... it's horrible. Trust me, if it's here it's worth a fortune. Lift. A tapestry? Too figurative, this is far better. - Figurative... - Lift. He paid its worth in weight! Rudisky's clever. Who's Rudisky? He can't modify the clock! Is he dumb or what? Hey! What's up? Every time I hit the clock, it goes back to start! It says it there. Strange, we followed the instructions. Is Lucie dumb or what? Shit! I found the bug... Dad, we're on a roll! Shit, the concierge! A half hour Mass? - Well no. - Well yes! Mass lasts an hour and a half. I didn't give the sermon! I'll handle it. If it goes wrong, get Christophe out first. What's going on? I was going to call the police. Where's Mr. Peyrade? He's never here when he's needed. We have an alarm problem, I can't reach him. - That's annoying. - lndeed! So Mr. Peyrade... I tell you... Mrs. Peyrade, is your husband... I got cut off. Tick this one. Call from inside. I was just going to ask you that. - Oh dear! - Don't worry... it's fine. He went in with the lady. Come on, register! - Now? - Now! What about the statue? What statue? The statue. What do we do with it? This is dumb, you could've stolen a painting, a tapestry. Too figurative. Don't push, I'm carrying the load. Shut up! We have an... alarm problem at the Versailles agency, I'm here with... Mrs...? Akenasian. Spell that slowly. Start again... Mrs. Akenasian! So... Fine! Bye Mrs. Peyrade! Don't move from here, he'll call back. I'll get a tool from my car, because he'll call right back. Don't go away! - Who do I drop first? - Christophe. We're the champions! - You ok, sweets? - Yes. Go on up home! Where were you? With his father. What's this mess? Would you explain? You don't give me time and you hit me. We'll explain! Why have you been with Christophe since 5 a.m? We went climbing. Climbing! Who do you take me for? You've been hanging out, calling behind my back! It's all my fault! Whatever you did with my boy, if you've caused problems, I'm beating the shit out of you! I'm not kidding! What the hell did you do? - I'll tell you later. - You're not coming? No... we have things to finish. Things to finish? He always had things to finish at night when I lived with him. Want to do the same? Great, but without me! Big trouble. Christophe can handle her? It'll be tough on me! We were careful, no fingerprints, no one saw Christophe. She's a mother, she worries... Don't lecture me. Wow, she's tough. - Don't bust our balls! - Yeah, don't! - Who's that? - The expert. The fake one. What are you doing here? I had to see you. - How d'you get in? - Someone opened the door. There's a serious problem. It's in the garage, it'll interest you. Wait two minutes. What's up? When Maxime's here, I'll explain. It went fine. Sorry, I should've come. It went fine. I feel bad. Don't, it went fine. I feel so terribly bad! No, it went fine... Two minutes. So? I'm pretty good about fires. Considering where it caught, near the saw... I saw strange marks on the wall. It wasn't logical. So I told myself that... Make it short, ok? Make it short, will you... I checked around. He started the fire. What are you doing here? What's this about? He started it. Is it true? Is he telling the truth? Tell me, is he? Let me go! I just wanted to steal some dough. Why'd he start the fire? Why? My cigarette fell, I tried to put it out with water, that burned too. Must have been Turpentine. Does he know what the hell he's done? - The dough was for you. - Why? He didn't give Nath dough, it worried you. Quite the busy-body! He would've sooner or later. - With the insurance scam! - What? - How d'you know? - The climbing... Unbelievable! Your deal stunk! Can I have 5 minutes? You bet you can. I thought Sami did it. A jealousy thing. I set the kid up but... to protect Sami, he spit it out. Beautiful. Just had to think. It's beautiful the kid confessed to protect Sami. That too. It'll be less beautiful if the real expert finds out. I'm in deep shit. Let's cloud the issue. Move a machine or two, fix the decor. Not bad! The kid knows how the fire started. Helps! What about you? I could move in with you and Nath... I'd fuck up less. Maybe even not at all. I don't like the "maybe". Not at all at all... ok? We need your pyromaniac, to explain things. Is this good? More in the corner, that's where I threw the Turpenstuff. Where d'you come in? From the fanlight. Clever kid! Congratulate him too! - I tried to... - Skip it! Stop. It's good there. There's traces there. Better put it there. What? He's right. Let's do it. Wait! You're useless. He's not helping. He's not laying a hand on my machines. They give you a time? Sometime today. It's like waiting for final exams results. I never passed them. When you fail final exams, you don't go to jail. - She's here. - Who? The expert. A woman? Yes, a woman! - Fuck! - What? It's Chastaing! I've dealt with her. She's tough. Wait at the cafe! - Just when.... - Wait at the cafe. Let's go! I was eating with the others. There he is. Mrs. Chastaing, Versailles lnsurance expert. We were expecting you. Maxime Nassieff, insurer. Actually, courtier. - We've met. - Maybe. Let's begin. Fires are important file claims. Yours is late. We were gathering paperwork. Shall we go? After you. Hello Mr. Sami. She's here. No, it's a woman. The fire started at lunch? Exactly. When I found out, I ran... We were eating. I took lots of risks, l... burned my hair a little. But you can't tell. Are your walls treated? Fireproof coated. I reported that, entirely fireproof coated. I can't talk now... I'll call you back Sylvie. I'll call back. Excuse me. We can't reimburse what you paid originally for the machines. I kill myself telling my clients. Can't pay the original price. I just said that. The amount of the guarantee seems exorbitant. Three million five... What do you mean? At the time... Iots of machines were new. How many extinguishers? In the workshop? Two. May I see where? One was here, the one I used. Another one was there, but I couldn't reach it. I'll turn it off. Do you have invoices for the machines? I think so. Should I get them? It really burned, huh? What are you doing here? Speaking to the young lady. And the expert? She wants invoices. Normal. Don't worry. Marthe, did you hear? Find the original invoices. I prepared them. That's not it but... how do we recoup our bonuses? You saw it didn't burn there, it's pretty strange. The roller-saw's there, thank God because it's an expensive machine. - Unusual. - lndeed. What do you think of the merger with Mutuelles lnsurance? Would be great for us courtiers... They're originals. I'll study them later. Sorry? I'll study them later. How old is the workshop? 1930. My grandfather founded the company. When my father died, I returned from Brazil and took over. I had beautiful antique work-benches there. In my office too. They burned in the fire, it's horrible. Was this always here? What? - Was this machine here? - Yes, no. Depends. Why? - There are traces. - Possible. We moved things to clean up. Of course. Excuse me. Is she buying this? She's suspicious, it's her job. Not too smart the traces. I'll lay a trace on you... Why's she looking at us? She's not. I don't like it. Me neither. I'm sorry. Bad news? My daughter's with a neighbour, small complications. Mr. Nassieff, while I finish with Mr. Lansi, would you get the original contract? It's at my office, I'll be back. I need to talk to you alone. You know what this is? You don't know? A back-dated contract. You weren't really insured. What do you mean? Does the name Passereau mean anything? He registered contracts only when accidents happened. He shared bonuses with courtiers, among which Mr. Nassieff. No kidding... Passereau died and the fraud was discovered today. That's why they called me. I paid my bonus, I have my check stub. Counts, right? Of course. The Financial Brigade's on the way to Nassieff's office. Yes! Sorry, a customer. I'll be right back. I'm a bit late with your floor! What floor? Everything burned, but we'll get going soon! Run, tell Maxime cops are on his ass. Sorry about the delay! Call me! Call me here. What's going on? Mr. Nassieff? Police. Shit, shit, shit. Know what's going on here? I'm so ashamed, Mr. Nassieff. I betrayed your trust. It's over, I confessed. Confessed what? She embezzeled insurance bonuses. She backdated contracts. But... how did you do it? Passereau taught me, you've got nothing to reproach yourself. You didn't suspect anything? Under 14, both on a moped. And no helmets! Shit! Why is it busy? - What's wrong? - Cops at Maxime's. - Dad knows? - Yes, but I can't reach him. Is Dad in danger? Did he turn off his mobile? Once I send the report to the office, the advance'll take... two or three weeks, not more. The taxman's on my back. Shall I send him to you? Absolutely. There's no... You won't believe what happened! It's unbelievable! My secretary embezzeled bonuses! Outrageous, isn't it? I trusted her completely! You mean... Lucie? Yes, Lucie. The police came to the office, Lucie confessed. It's... it's terrible. Did you suspect anything? No. That's why I wanted the original contract. Of course! I noticed nothing... I feel terrible about it! I like things to be fair and... square! It doesn't change things for Lansi? Our company always takes responsability, including courtier's errors! I'll see you out. Many thanks. So it was Lucie? Crazy, isn't it? Really crazy! She took the blame. I didn't ask her. She figured... if I go to jail, she'll be on the street. No money, no job. If I'm free, I can take care of her. What could I do? Take the blame. You're a scum bag. Hey, don't preach to me... I didn't insure you, but the fire was criminal! Just wait for the money. Nothing else! Yes, something else. Know what? This? Think I don't care about Lucie? What... what do you think? It had to happen. He'll kill him! Let them talk it over! Asshole, I'm gonna kill you! - You all right? - Yes. Is he? He's fine. He coughed a lot last week. He stopped coughing. He sends you this. How sweet! You speak Russian? I'm learning. It's a dictionary. He didn't tell you? When I'm out, we'll go there to open an insurance office. Know "insurance" in Russian? "Zastrakhovat". Not bad, huh? Not bad. He's selling my flat to get started. Is it a good idea? We'll need money there. I have to go, they're delivering a new machine. Good. It was nice ofyou to come. Tell him I love him. Can you sign the delivery slip? Wait! Let's unpack this little machine. What the hell is this? What? It's not the C89S, it's the C89C. - You didn't notice? - Nope. I didn't order this one. This one's the C89C. They tell me to deliver, I deliver. Take it back. Look, I'm not bullshitting. Tell it to my boss. You signed and unpacked it, so... We'll never make Compiegne's delivery. Montrel? It's Lansi. A mistake? What do I do in the meantime? I'll keep it. You deliver the other one next week, otherwise your l.O.U's... I agree. Fine, I'll tell him. - So? - I'll keep it. Big help. What do we do without the moulding machine? Like they used to, without. It's Lambert, about the stockroom rent. The check went last week. We were late! It was last month's rent. If months last a week, I can't deal with it! Wait, let me explain. You'll understand... Let me speak... I mailed your check this morning... Absolutely... trust me!
