[Music playing] [Dramatic music playing] [Explosion] MS. CAMDEN: Who's down there? Just me, Ms. Camden. MS. CAMDEN: Mr. Thorn, what business Have you in the cellar? Setting traps, ma'am. MS. CAMDEN: I realize that you are new around here. However, your responsibilities lie outside of the house. I suggest that you return to yours at once. Yes, ma'am. Well, that's a good one. "Victim 66." What better place to read a script than on a movie set? Mr. Joverson, I have just come from the cellar where I Found Mr. Thorn snooping about. Well? Well what? UNCLE IVE: Ms. Camden, you know perfectly well What, or else you wouldn't be telling me this. There is no indication that it was discovered. If that's true, why all the fuss? Because although I don't think he found it, I also don't feel that enough caution can be exercised Regarding this subject. I understand your concern. However, I... I feel you are needlessly worrying yourself. [Glass breaking] "He emerges from the cave as if created from the bowels" Of the universe to seek out and avenge death upon "A mortal creature of earth." Boy, some silly shit. "Then, as though it was possessed" By some demonic force, it comes to life, compelled with one Thought and one thought only. Fire Thorn. Fire Thorn. "Thorn, you're fired." Oh, that bitch. That's her idea of some kind of a joke. And for what? Doing my job? (SOFT ACCENT) Mr. Thorn. Your responsibilities lie outside the house. Mine lie within. Yeah, well, you'll see. Got a case, huh. That figures. Taking everything from me from the day I started here. I knew it. Mr. Thorn. I've been meaning to tell you that your employ here Will be determined by your ability To follow through with rules. Rules, my ass. Bitch runs this place like a prison, like she owns it. Mr. Thorn, your past will have no reflection on my feelings Towards you. Give me a break. [Dogs barking] What the hell is the idea behind all of this? Is this your idea of some kind of a joke? Or don't you have the guts to confront Me and tell me yourself? You're gutless, Camden. Gutless. Oh, I love your get-up. I think you watch too many cartoons. Come on, Camden. Fire me. Fire me. [Flamethrower sounds] [Screams] [MUSIC AZHA, "NIGHT OF OUR LIVES"] Your uncle's been waiting to see you. Go ahead. We'll unpack. Come on. This place is amazing. Yes, it is. Your uncle has spent many years traveling while constantly Adding to his collection. Electric piece of shit. It must be jammed again. Cary must have his own secret code. Hey, yo, Linda. What do you say you and I go for a little walk While Lenny here plays Mr. Goodwrench? How do I know I can trust you? You don't. Well, if that's the case, let's go. Yo, Shelly. What do you say we go for a little walk And see if we can find something to persuade This thing to open, OK? Can I trust you? Yeah, I guess so. Cary. I'm so glad to see you've arrived safely. CARY: Dad said that you collected things, But I never imagined it would be like this. UNCLE IVE: It's taken me quite some time To put all this together. I can believe it. Over here. Oh, we'll definitely find something. "Victim 67." Ah. I think I found my persuader. Great. Come on, let's go. Come on. This place is so beautiful. Yeah, great. Nature. Hey, uh, what do you say you and I get au natural? Not here. Anyone could just walk by and see us. Who? Who's going to walk by. We're 20 miles in the middle of nowhere. All right, Ms. Modesty. How 'bout those bushes at the end of the path? You know, Cary, it might be more interesting for you And your friends to stay over in the Mexican village While you're here. That way, you could have the whole place to yourselves. MS. CAMDEN: Yes, Cary. It might be a good idea for you and your friends To stay in a separate house during your visit So as not to disturb your uncle. I had entertained the idea and I've Prepared it for your visit. That's one of the old movie sets, isn't it? [Giggling] [Scream] I think I'm gonna puke. Suspect and... DETECTIVE BENJAMIN: You say the last time You spoke to the victim was yesterday afternoon? Yes, you heard me correctly. Seems as though the deceased was Struck down by what appears to be Some sort of incendiary device. Now, it's evident that further investigation Will be necessary, but off the record, this was no accident. Excuse me. Mr. Joverson, I really do not feel That it is necessary for you to be out here. Excuse me, Ms. Camden, but I would Like to ask Mr. Joverson some questions, if you don't mind. Hi, I'm Detective Benjamin. Good evening. Ive Joverson. Tell me. How long was Garland Thorn in your employ? Approximately two months. Oh man. Did you see that shit? I mean, he was fucked up. Yeah, it was pretty bad. I never seen anything like that before. No, I mean his legs were all up around his neck And his chest was all caved in and he was all toasted. He had bugs everywhere. In his eyes, in his mouth. [Crying] SHELLY: Gene, would you stop it? You're only making things worse. Look, I'm one for getting fried, but this is ridiculous. Dude, just cool it, all right? Uncle Ive. Uncle Ive, I'm sorry about Mr. Thorn. UNCLE IVE: I, too, am sorry. Thorn? UNCLE IVE: I'm also sorry that this had to happen During your stay with us. You think your plans will change as a result of this tragedy? Well, we really haven't discussed it. I should hope nothing changes. I mean, we just got here. Look, I'm sorry the dude got cooked, But speaking for myself, I would like to stay. I don't see why not. Well, I foresee no problems as long as they keep in mind That they are here as guests. CARY: No problem. Well, we've done all we can for now. I'd like to thank you for your corporation. I may have to question you further Once the autopsy's performed. Well, feel free to call me anytime. [Music playing] Damn. It's called a Heimlich maneuver. You use the Heimlich maneuver to save the girl's life, Not the hymen remover. That is something totally different. That's what I said. Hymen remover. This is a pretty neat place, Cary. I like this place. Regular Motel Six. Yeah, it is. I remember coming up here as a kid. I used to love to play hide and seek in this house. Seemed a lot bigger then. It had all these cool hallways and passageways, All that shit you thought was real neat as a kid. GENE: Still sounds pretty cool to me. Hey, why don't we all go play a game of hide and seek? Better yet, Linda. Why don't you and I go plat a game of hide the salami. Why don't you go and hide your salami yourself? Yeah. Yeah. And as soon as you find it, we'll find you. It's gone. I can't believe it, but it's gone. What are we going to do? We're going to find it. Check his room or wherever else he may have been. Just find it. Will you be all right while I'm gone? I'll be fine. What are you watching? I don't know. One of those old classic horror films. Oh my god, I remember this one. It used to give me nightmares as a kid. Oh, yeah. I think I've seen this one. Isn't this the one where the woman gets her head Chopped off with an axe. Oh, yeah. That's it. Oh, Gene, you gotta see this one. This woman gets her head chopped off with an axe, The head goes flying. When it lands, you'd swear it was going to say something. That's what I like about these movies. They're so realistic. Hey, man. It could happen. Oh. Do we really have to watch this? I am serious, man. Think about it. Think about it. I mean, imagine getting your head cut off. I mean, does it hurt? Do you feel it? Is it just a sharp pain and then it's over, Or is it over before you know it with no pain involved? Come on, think about it, man. I mean, you're sitting there with no head. You can't see shit. There's blood all over the place. Come on, think about it. I really wonder what that would be like. Gene. Then go ahead and fine out. But be sure to let us know, because I sure as hell Don't know anybody who'd be able to tell about it. Man, you think about it. Because I'm serious. Well, I wouldn't want to die that way. I mean, I thought about this. I want to go away as a hero. You know, with style. I don't know how, but I want it to be Something that... something that people would remember. I'm sorry, hey. I want the glory. Glory? I don't find any glory in death. I don't know about you guys, but there Is just no way I want to die. I mean, I've never thought about it and I'm not going to. There's just no way I want to die. [Dramatic music playing] I mean, it's inevitable. Sooner or later, we're all going to die. None of us like to think about it, But it's human nature to wonder about it. Things like how, when, why, and what happens afterwards. Come on. We've all lost people in our lives, People we've cared about. And we've all wondered why and where are they now. Are they happy? Are they even anything? I don't know. I don't think I'd want to die a hero, And I certainly know I wouldn't want my head to be chopped off. I don't even think I'd want to die of old age. I think of death as something quiet and peaceful. I think of sleep, or even making love. [Footsteps] "Victim 67." "She came from nowhere, as if created from The bowels of the universe. Then, as though it were possessed By some demonic force, it comes to life with one Thought and one thought only. Fire Thorn. Fire Thorn. "Thorn, you're fired." Thorn. This is strange. Friends, it's time to get crazy. It's too late. Wait a minute, guys. Help me with some of this shit. [Music playing] Woo. Woo hoo. [Music playing] Woo hoo. [Music playing] Sorry, Ms. Camden. You may call your friends to lunch now. Yo, Shelly. Everything come out all right? Cute. Mr. Joverson, your house is really impressive. I mean, I've never seen so many animal heads or skins In one person's home before. Where'd they all come from? Oh, they're just a few things I collected over the years. Oh, he's just being modest. You should see his museum. You mean there's more? Tons more. Oh yeah? Can we see it? UNCLE IVE: Well, if you're interested, I'd be delighted to show you. No shit? I mean, that sounds cool. I can dig seeing Bambi hanging on a wall. Gene. Very well, then. I would appreciate it if you left your beverages Out here for a while. Cary, would you ask Ms. Camden to bring me a jacket? Sure. Bet it gets cold in the museum. All right. [Belch] Bambi. Jeez, Cary. You weren't kidding about this place. CARY: Hey, would I lie? What's in this display, Mr. Joverson? UNCLE IVE: They're pre-Columbian artifacts, Shelly. Well, where did they come from? Well, most of it was collected in South America, the Amazon Region in particular. Isn't that supposed to be a pretty Dangerous area for a white man? Well, in most instances, yes. However, my case was a little different. CARY: Didn't my dad tell me something About you being a member of a tribe or something? UNCLE IVE: You might say that, yes. What really happened was my pilot And I were on our way to meet with an art Dealer in Rio de Janeiro. When we lost one of our engines, we Were forced to make a... an emergency Crash landing in the Amazon. Fortunately, our descent was witnessed By a group of tribesman known as the Nonspectas. Well, they quickly befriended us because they thought we Were gods sent down from above. Without the Nonspectas, it would have Been nearly impossible to have procured a great deal Of what you see here. CARY: Jesus Christ, man. You for real? Shelly. Come on, let's go play some volleyball. Um, sure. I'll be right there. Right away. Come on. Lenny's waiting. OK, I'll catch up with you guys. You journalists are all alike. If you're not writing, you're reading. Come on. Let's go. OK, I will be right there, god. Perfect. SHELLY: "Interior barn, night." It's a little dusty, but I think it'll do. How did you find this place? I've got my secrets. What can I say, I'm a man of many surprises. You ready? The question is, are you? I'm getting ready here, boss. OK, gonna get ready, boss. Getting off, boss. Here we go. Taking it off. Boss, going off. LINDA: You like it? The only thing that would look better on you is me. [Music playing] [Wind sound] [Boards creaking] [Wind and creaking] [Music playing] [Scream] [Loud crash] [MUSIC "WHEN THE AXE COMES DOWN"] (SHOUTING) What the fuck is going on? [MUSIC "WHEN THE AXE COMES DOWN"] (SINGING) There ain't no sense in losing your head. It might be a dream or you might be dead. Going down fast, oh, you better be Ready when the axe comes down. When the axe comes down. When the axe comes down. When the axe comes down. [Explosion] This stuff is sick. Perfect for Gene. I'll have to show it to him in the morning. I wonder if he can read. This is not what I call a four course breakfast. Fruit? Fruit? A breakfast is grits, eggs, and butter. No. I supposed to butter my pear, butter my eggs or something? Yeah. That's a good idea. They got all this fruit out here, But they don't even have any ernge juice to drink. Ernge juice? You mean orange juice. It's not important. What do I got, the fruit of the loom or something? Good morning. Good morning. Cary, where are your other two friends? I don't know. I thought they were already down here. Well, you know how those two are. They probably went walking or something. If I was you, I wouldn't worry about. Well, I suppose I can leave from fruit out for them. Fruit? That way, they can have it when they return. That would be fine. I'm sure it would be appreciated. Did you find them? No, we looked everywhere. Yeah, we looked in... at every hill, cave, and valley around. I didn't even hear them leave this morning. Neither did I. I was up pretty early. Don't look at me, because I can sleep on a picket fence. I'm sure they'll turn up. I hope so. [Birds chirping] MS. CAMDEN: Do you have a search warrant? Do you have any legal cause to be here? I don't need a search warrant, Ms. Camden. - Yes, you do. - I'm only doing my job. You are harassing me and you are Harassing that poor sick man. I'm not harassing you. I have to ask you questions. I have had enough. I'm doing a job and it's... Go away and leave us alone. I'll be back. Detective Benjamin, hi. I'm Shelly. Shelly. Oh, yes. Yes, I remember. How are you? Oh, I'm fine. Thanks. It looked like you were having a problem with Ms. Camden. Is everything all right? Yeah. Yeah. A lot of people get upset with our line of questioning. What they don't understand is that it's all routine. Although her reaction's understandable being that This is a homicide investigation. Anyway, what can I do for you. This is going to sound really silly. I... I'd like you to look at something. Please keep an open mind. Sure. What is this? It's some sort of script. Shelly, where did you find this? In the barn the first day we got here. This is going to sound really silly, But there are scenes appearing where blank pages were before. And I swear that the title keeps changing, too. If you'd look at the first scene, It's almost as if it could be about Mr. Thorn's death. Tell me, which way is it from here where we found Mr. Thorn? It's over this way. Come on, I'll show you. Has anything else you might consider Strange been happening? No. Everything else has been normal. Well, except I haven't seen Gene or Linda since last night. It's over there. OK, well just hold on a second. Let me go ahead and take a look around. Sure. Linda? And Gene? Oh my god, no. Detective Benjamin, get out of there. [Wind blowing] [Scream] That was back in '71 somewhere. I was a little kid at the time. Big shit. [Interposing voices] Give me something to complain about and you jump... Wait a minute. What's the matter, Shelly? What, what, what? What's the matter? Calm down. It was just an earthquake. Yeah. Take a deep breath or something. Come on. What's this? Detective Benjamin, he's dead. This script is killing everybody. Gene and Linda, too. I know they're dead. What are you talking about? Have you seen them? No, but it's in the script. What are you talking about? Ca... Shelly, calm down. Detective Benjamin, the cop, is dead? Yes. I just saw the whole thing. You saw it? Yes. Where? Where is he now? Take us to him. It's over here. It was right here. I swear, it was right here. I saw it. I swear I saw it. You guys don't believe me, do you? It's not that we don't believe you, It's just that... It's just that you Have a pretty active imagination and this Is a pretty wild story. Bullshit. Look, you said something about Gene and Linda being dead. Where was that? How do you know? Did you see that, too? No, I told you it's in the script. It... it tells how it killed Mr. Thorn and... and Gene and Linda, And I just saw it suck in Detective Benjamin. And it spit him back in my face. How can a script kill someone? CARY: Here. This might help. I don't know. But I've seen this thing go through transitions. I've seen written pages appear where There were blank ones before. And the title changes when it kills someone off. What I don't understand is why we haven't Any bodies, or even traces that anyone Was killed in the first place. Well, we found Mr. Thorn's body. Why can't we find anybody else? I don't know. I'm not writing this script. I'm just reading it like you guys. Well, whatever is happening, we got to get over to my uncle's House and call the police. Come on. Let's go. Ms. Camden, we need to use the telephone. Can't it wait? Your uncle is resting. No, it can't. We have to call the police. There's people dying around here. Still dead. I'm afraid that's not going to work. If you'll sit down, I'll explain why. But I'm trying to call the police. I'm sure the script has rendered The telephone useless by now. Mr. Joverson, would you please tell Us what's going on around here? Gene and Linda are missing and I just saw Detective Benjamin get killed. I... who knows what. Yes, Shelly. I know. And I'm afraid your friends lives may have been taken also. You must try to understand what we're dealing with here. It's not something the law enforcement Officials can help us with. Then exactly what is it? Yeah. You remember my telling you about my time in the Amazon With the Nonspectas? Well, several months prior to my last visit to the Amazon, The Nonspectas were being pestered By an American journalist. The journalist was so relentless in his quest To photograph the Nonspectas that they became Frightened, and then desperate. And they took his life in order to protect Their clandestine lifestyle. But shortly after the death of the journalist, Terrible things started happening to the Nonspectas. Feeling that it was the spirit of the journalist, They deposited his remains in a sacred urn. The urn was one that was used to contain evil spirits. After they secured the remains in the urn, Their lives returned to normal. When I arrived, they explained to me what had happened. And they asked me to bring the urn back with me To the United States in order to return the journalist To his native soil. Well, I agreed to bring it back thinking It would make a perfect addition to my pre-Columbian art Collection. So I brought it back to my home, disregarding the warnings Of the evils within. Then in the 1950s, shortly after Ms. Camden came into my employ, She was cleaning up in the museum. Without knowledge of that urn, she uncovered it while dusting. At that point, the evil spirit was freed from its captivity, And the life force of that spirit Harbored itself in the script of the film that was Being done here at the time. That script was entitled "Victim." "Victim?" When I first found the script, it was entitled "Victim 67." And now it's "Victim 70." Do you mean to tell me that that script has killed 70 people? Over the years, yes. What the hell are we doing here? I'm getting the fuck out of here. You don't understand. It won't let you leave. LENNY: Bullshit. You want to see? I'm getting... I'm getting the fuck out of here. UNCLE IVE: We must contain the script. It's the only way. It's not my only way. [Banging] LENNY: Come on, you son of a bitch. Open. SHELLY: Don't touch the fence. What are you talking about? I'm going to get the hell out of here. Now, you can sit in there listening To honky tonky bullshit, but I'm getting the fuck out of here. But it's the fence. It's electrified. Bullshit. I just got through yanking on it. [Sizzling sound] It's in the script. LENNY: OK, I believe you. Now, you said we have to contain this thing. Well, what do we do? I mean, how do we do it? We must return it to the urn. Well, let's do it. It's not that easy. My paralysis is a result of our last attempt to restrain it. But... but it's our only way out, isn't it? Yes. Well, let's do it, then. [Crickets chirping] All right. You guys wait up here while Lenny and I go deal with this. Very well. The trunk containing the urn is down the stairs And to your left. All right. Thanks. Come on. [Crickets chirping] It must be in there. [Thud] This is great. Relax. Well, go ahead. I'm not sticking my hand in there. Fine. [Clank] Cary. That thing is shaking when you put that script by it. Yeah. I can see that. Cary, man. The shit is starting to glow. Yeah, I can see that. What the hell are you messing with it for? I'm trying to get us out of here. Oh. Relax, will you. [Explosion] SHELLY: I sure hope this works. Yeah, you, me, and the rest of the world. [Clock ticking] Have you found anything? Nothing that applies to this situation. Our only hope is that we stopped it once before. Yes. But it didn't have nearly as much power as it has now. What's going to happen to us? I don't know. We must remain strong. If we fall apart, it will continue to strengthen itself. SHELLY: I can't believe all this stuff is happening to us now Because of something that happened to someone Else almost 40 years ago. LENNY: The whole thing is pretty unbelievable. You know, it's a real weird feeling, How Gene and Linda are gone. Just yesterday, we were all sitting around together Having a good time. I know what you mean. I keep thinking that I'm going to open up a door And we'll be sitting there goofing around like always. Look, I know it's hard to do but we got to face the fact, They're gone and not going to come back anymore. [Dramatic music playing] [Crying] It's all right. [Crying] It's OK. Shelly, relax. Here. Try some of this. Thanks. I'll be all right. I just need to rest a while, I guess. We all need to relax. Try and get some sleep. I'll try. OK? [Piano music] [Music playing] [Splashes] [Music playing] [Squish] [Scream] It's OK. It's all right. It was only a dream. SHELLY: Oh, god. Oh, god, you would not believe the nightmare I just had. Oh, god. It was just awful. We've got to get out of here. We gotta stop this thing. If only I was writing that script. Yeah. That's it. We'll rewrite the script, insert the scenes, And see what happens. Get serious. Wait a minute. What have e got to lose? Is there a typewriter around here? Is there a typewriter we can use? Yes, of course. May I ask why? Yes. We're going rewrite the script, insert the scenes, And see what happens. Cary, you cannot change that which has already been done. No, I mean we're going to try and rewrite and stick Them in and see what happens. I imagine it's worth a try. I'll get the typewriter. Hey. Hey. LENNY: Write a helicopter comes down and land in the yard And we all get away. No. No, no, no. That's ridiculous. That would never work. Write a... a bunch of cops come. Yeah, a whole force of cops come and get us out of here. That won't work either. And you thought mines was dumb. - It was. - Yeah, well. You the writer. You figure it out. Why don't you simply eliminate the power source To the front gate by having a total power Failure at the ranch? Yeah. Why not? Great idea. Cool. Then we all drive out of here. That'll be fine if it'll work. [Typewriter sounds] Come on. Oh, god. Oh, come on. God, I hope this idea works. It sounds like we tried. You guys. Say a prayer this one works. LENNY: Ya fucking hoo. Let's get out of here. CARY: Yeah, hurry up. Come on. Let's get into the car. Help me with my uncle Ive. Come on, Lenny. You'll have to get out of the car and open the gate manually. Remember, the electricity's off. The remote control won't work. [Dramatic music playing] CARY: What the hell is that? Hey, you guys. Forget it. The power's on now. What is this? Come on, man. I've been through this shit before. Ah. Joverson? Mr. Joverson? Uncle I've, what's wrong? This excitement's been too much for your uncle. We have to get him to the house immediately. Come on. Let's go. Mr. Joverson? Hurry. [Car engine] [Rumbling sounds] Just think positive. We'll get out soon. Ms. Camden. How's my uncle? Is he all right? I'm afraid that he suffered a mild heart attack. If given the opportunity to rest, he should be fine. I'm going to make him some tea now. I guess you're right. Would it be OK if I went in to see him? I think it best that you give him some time to recover first. SHELLY: Yeah, Cary. He'll be all right. Just give him an hour or so. Yeah, I guess you're right. Would it be all right if I had some of that tea, too? Of course. This shit has got to stop. Shelly, I'm going to go over to the old movie Set for a few minutes. I need to pick up a few things. You want anything? Are you crazy? You're not going over there alone. I'm going to go with you. No, you stay here. I'll be right back. Just wait. Cary and I'll go with you. Shelly, it'll be all right. There's nothing to worry about. I tell you what. What? Let's check the crystal ball. I guess that'll be all right. Come on. See that? There's nothing to worry about. I'm in the clear. All right. But will you please be careful? No sweat. Oh, Cary. I don't think we'll be having a formal dinner this evening. Would you like me to make some sandwiches For you and your friends? No, thanks. This will be fine for right now. Ms. Camden, thank you. It means a great deal to me that... seeing how Well you take care of my uncle. It shows how much you really do care about him. Thank you, Cary. Where's Lenny? He went over to the old movie set. I tried to talk him out of going, but he insisted. That wasn't too swift. I know. Well, we checked the script and there wasn't anything new, So he thought it was OK. Yeah. I guess he'll be all right. Hope so. Cookie? Thanks. [Loud thud] [Rattling] Who's out there? [Loud sound] Oh, shit. [Rattling] [Thud] [Scream] No. [Growling sounds] MS. CAMDEN: No. No. No. Please. Please, no. Oh. What do you want with... with me? Oh. No. Oh, please. No. Ah. Who are you? No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh. No. Please. Please. No. No. Please. No. [Squish] Lenny. Lenny what? Lenny, he's... the script. The number's changed. Lenny's gone. Oh my god. I told him not to go alone. Come on. [Crickets chirping] [Music playing] Shit. [Music playing] [Explosion] [Music playing] [Motorcycle engines] [Music playing] Something tells me that this isn't the cavalry. [Music playing] Maybe he made it back to your uncle's. Yeah, maybe. Let's go find out. Come on. [Crickets chirping] Cary. I can't run anymore. I... can we just rest, please? It's OK. I need a break, too. I can't believe we ran so far. I can't either. We did it. Is it raining? What the... What? [Scream] At least we know that Lenny's safe. [Dramatic music playing] CARY: Uncle Ive. Uncle Ive? Uncle Ive. Holy shit. Oh, god. I'm sorry, uncle. I don't... Lord, he's in your hands now. How we ask that you forgive his sins and let him rest in peace. Cary, one must first be content with life before they can rest. Uncle Ive, you're alive. You're all right. I... I cannot rest knowing this aberration is wreaking Its bestial behavior on us all. Oh, thank God, you're alive. Yes. Yes, of course. I... we're all in this together. Uncle Ive, I have something to tell you. It's about Ms. Camden. She... Ms. Camden, well... she was... She was a very good woman. She looked out for me. She took care of me. I... I understand. Thank you, Cary. I... I will miss her. I'm sorry. We know that she cared for you very much. Cary, you must promise me one thing. Sure, anything. You must promise me you will beat this... this thing. It must be put to rest forever so never Again will it harm anyone. Be careful. Be strong. Fight to preserve what soon will be yours. I will. I promise. Well, how's your uncle? Is he all right? Yeah, he's fine. Well, what's your hurry? What's wrong? Nothing. It's just something he said. What did he say? It's time to go get Lenny. [Whistling] [Dramatic music playing] OK, come on. [Whistling] [Twig snap] Cary, wait. What was that? What was what? That. Something creepy. [Groans] Come on, you son of a bitch. [Growling] [Gunshot] [Dramatic music playing] Did you see the size of that thing? Yeah. Incredible. Well, that's one down. Two to go. Come on, let's go. Before they get Lenny. Cary, wait. You said something about your uncle before. What did he say? It's kind of far-fetched. He said you must be content with life Before you can rest in peace. Yeah, so? Don't you get it? No. This guy, this journalist, he was killed by the Nonspectas. His body was cremated and stuffed in that voodoo bottle. Of course. He's pissed. Exactly. The poor guy never had a proper burial. His spirit is in limbo. Oh, great. Now that we've figured that out, what are we going to do? First we got to go get Lenny, then go back to the house.
