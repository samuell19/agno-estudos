You can stay in my room tillyou find a place of your own. Thank you. Mom. I wish I hadn't caused all this. Nah. Nah. [guitar playing] Well, what'd she say? Now there's a [inaudible]. You've got to be blue to be country. You've got to cry to sing. [guitar playing] Looks like you got beat up pretty bad, Zaf. Yeah, well, our troublesain't over yet, dudes. [guitar playing] There's no job for youhere, boy-- too much trouble. I'm sorry, my boy. That's OK. You stuck your neck out for me. Zafir? Maybe we'll try again onceyour life is sorted out. Yeah, could you-- I'll ring your mom. Thanks. He's wild, that boy. I like him. He's got guts. You know what that means? Sure, I do. [inaudible]. [chatter] What's going down? Heavy scene, man. [television] [crying]. I've lost everything. Come on. All right, but-- Hey, Zaf, take it easy, eh? I'll see if my parents willlet me back in the house. Please don't walk on us, Rif. I'll still be your singer. I just don't want to causeany more hassles here. I love you, Rifat. I hadn't said that to anyone-- anyone. Zaf, I want you to be a friend, maybe even my best friend. What about the other night? I needed you. I'm sorry. It's all right. I knew it wasn't going to happen. I just had to tell you, though. Please understand. You going to be great in country, Rif. But you're a real heartbreaker, babe. That's me all over, dude. [music - "the river"] [SINGING] You know the dream is like a river, every-changing as it flows. And a dream is just a vesselthat must follow where it goes. Trying to learn from what'sbehind you, never knowing what's in store makes eachday a constant battle just to stay between the shores. And I will sail my vesseltill the river runs dry. Like a bird upon the wind,these waters are my sky. I'll never reach mydestination if I never try, so I will sail my vessel till the river runs dry. Too many times we stand asideand let the water slip away, till what we put off tilltomorrow has now become today. So don't you sit upon the shoreline and say you're satisfied butchoose to chance the rapids and dare to dance the tides. Yes, I will sail my vesseltill the river runs dry. Like a bird upon the wind,these waters are my sky. I'll never reach mydestination if I never try. So I will sail my vessel till the river runs dry. There's bound to be rough waters, and I know I'll take some falls. But with the good Lord as my captain, I can make it through them all. Yes, I will-- BAND: Sail my vessel till the river runs dry. Like a bird upon the wind, these waters are my sky I'll never reachmy destination if I never try. So I will sail my vessel-- This is gold. Pure gold. It's fat city, next stop for us, amigos. First thing tomorrow, I get[inaudible] Wild West records. Hey, hombres, they won't know what hit 'em. Yee-haw. RIFAT: [SINGING] Till the riverruns-- till the river runs dry. Well,boys, you've done a great job today. Come on. Hurry up. Pronto, pronto, pronto. I'm in a hurry. Come on. Come on, boys. Come on, hurry up. Don't mess around. Give me that video camera. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. I didn't know we were moving, man. Me neither. Where are we going? [television] What do you want to go toPakistan for, though, Mom. It is my home. It's [inaudible] by now, Mom. You won't be comfortable like you are here. It's all repeats on the TV. I mean, a lot of people think Sgt. Bilko is the new military dictator on account of him being on so often. I will be with my own kind of people, [inaudible] in my true country. What about us? I would like you to come with me. But I know you will not. You have no true country. We did this to you. Zaf. Zaf, you've got to get downstairs quick. Shit. What's [inaudible] now? Ugly Abdul. Get me some kind of weapon. What the fuck's he doing. Stay calm, all right? He's talking to Mom. I smell a rat, dude. Zaf. [inaudible]. What's going on, Mom? Your mother's just signing-- I wasn't asking you, handsome. Be quiet, Zafir. Mom, I really think you gotto tell us what you're up to. It's me who's done wrong, not Ali or Kay. I have sold the house. You what? Subject to all the usual legal formalities ZAF: To who? Hm? To me. You've got a house, Abdul. It's too damned big as it is. Oh, this is just to rent out. Listen, I'd heard yourmother put it up for sale, and I thought, well, I'dhelp her sell it quickly. You're a snake and a [inaudible]. Quiet. Don't. - Leave him. - All right. All right. Right. Auntie has asked me tomake this check out for you three brothers to share, hm? If you ask me, she's being very generous. So this is it, Mom? Yes. Hey, with that money the threeof you can buy a little hovel. It's a bad area. Zaf? I'm all right, dude. I just want to tell Kay, Oh, what are you lookingso hangdog about, boys? All right, listen, if youwant, maybe I'll consider renting you out your rooms, eh? [music playing] Zafir, Ali, come to Pakistan with me. We can get you good jobs in thearmy with your uncles there. One day, you could be in the government. [phone ringing] Yeah. [inaudible] All right, Jag. Yeah, I'm listening man. JAG [ON TELEPHONE]: You've gotan appointment [inaudible]. Kidding me. JAG [ON TELEPHONE]: No, I'm not kidding. Yeah, all right. JAG [ON TELEPHONE]: I'llpick you up in 10 minutes. Tell Zaf. Yeah, I'll tell him. [music playing] [camera shutter] Now say T-Bones in Nashville, Tennessee. ALL: T-Bones in Nashville, Tennessee. That will be for the official biography. Come on, now. Quick. Come on. Let's get in. Listen, boys, I am not for a moment denigrating your skills as musicians. Tell them, Yuhudi. No, no, it's definitely not a music thing. But what I'm talking about is product. I'm talking marketing. I'm talking saleability. You see, the music is onlythe half of it, I'm afraid. HANK: Maybe some fringe label. Yeah, yeah, there's lotsof weird leftist labels out there now. Maybe they would do you a deal, perhaps on the novelty value. Now, that's an angle-- novelty. That's something you should look at. But Wild West, boys, is mainstream. So it's the way we look? Yeah, looks can be a big thing. I mean, look at Dolly Parton. Look, the folks back home, they look at you, they think, shit, Ravi Shankar. This gives us problems, boys. Back in the US, they see a picture of you, they say, oh, boy, red Indianstrying to play country. Maybe down in Texas-- Big market Texas. --down there, they say, hey,these hombres are Mexican. They're trying to play our music. Then they get all historical. They say, remember the fucking Alamo. So you see this is not a pitch we can play. Your manager seems a little upset over there. Sorry, amigo. I was so keyed up over this. I thought we'd finally hit deep pan pizza time. Well, that's show biz. But you and me, we got a lot to talk about. Yuhudi, prepare a contract. No, I'm with them. Then you're on the down escalator, bubula. Look, you I can really sell. OK, so you got the dusky looks. But there's an angle there, maybe. And with a voice like yours-- Zaf, wait. I think you got to listen to the man, Rif. Amigo, I hope yourealize this lady here is one of my most valued clients. Well then, let us talk turkey. Yuhudi, show the boys out, will you? No. You have to take us together or forget it. I think you should explain the career implications of this touchingloyalty to your client. Can we have a few minutes? We need to talk. Sure, just don't strain yourvoice, doll-- that we need. Man, I always thoughtwe could duck the punches. These people got no sense of imagination, just let the rest of thiswhole damned, deadbeat country. We're just brown faces to them. Don't you duck out, Rif. You can show 'em. No, I can't do that Zaf. This is the hardest thingI'm ever going to do, Rif. But I've got to tell you to stay. You know how I feel about you. I just got to know that you'll be happy. But what about the band? There will be other deals, Zaf. Not for us. This is the end of the roadfor the Honky Tonks, songs Rif. We've been knocked back too many times. Let's face it, it wascut out to be a solo act. We always knew she was goingto do great, didn't we, men? Hey, Rif, go for the big time. Just remember to send usa postcard now and then, eh? Your doing this for all ofus, all us Southall kids. Hey, amigos, it's all happening in there. Come on. Let's go. Go, senorita. [clapping] [music playing] Well, boys. You still our manager, Jag? Hey, get yourselves some punk outfits, huh? Then I'll relaunch you. So hombres, adios, huh? Come on, Zaf. The streets are going to moveon us like vultures, man. We better lie low, get guns and stuff. No way, man. We ain't finished yet. Not yet, anyway. Maybe the world has got it in for us. Maybe we ought to takestock and be [inaudible]. But when do the Ayubs everlisten to good sense, eh? [music playing] I'd like five first classtickets to Nashville, please. How are you paying? Cash. See you, boy. KAY: Bye, Spooky. AZ: See you in Nashville. [singing] This is bye-bye Ayub brothers. [explosion] [MUSIC - "GUITARS AND CADILLACS"]
