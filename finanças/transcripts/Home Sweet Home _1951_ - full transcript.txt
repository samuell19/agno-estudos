Welcome back! Is that you, Nobuko? Where are you going at this time? Father, did you forget? I already told you I'm going to the chorus. Oh, yes, the chorus... Are you going alone? Yes, sister is busy painting. See you soon. Don't come back too late! Or mother will get worried. Hey, Kazuo, let's go home together. - We lost the game. - Really? I did a double, a lucky run and it was all in vain. That glove is really old. Yes, it's so hard to play with it. That's why I lost. - I'll buy you a new one. - When? Sometime soon. We're back. Welcome back. Welcome back, dad! - You forgot this outside. - You're so careless, Mitsuko. And you, dad, didn't you forget something? How could I? Here are the sweets you asked. Thanks. See? I never forget anything. Your boots are entirely worn out. - Mom, don't you need help with dinner? - No. You can't even cook. Kazuo, it's just that I'm painting my picture. - Well, you make poor paintings. - What? You'll get it now! Daddy, daddy, sis is being mean! What's going on over there? Our house is full of artistic women, isn't it? Darling, you forgot your umbrella, didn't you? My umbrella? Excuse me. How about it? The colors and lines? I've given my best. Can you see that? It's made from an old curtain. Who cares? Talent doesn't depend on the skirt you wear. - Well? Did it move you? - It did, it's marvelous. I'd never do something like that. Mr. Omiya is so good. Will I ever draw paintings this good? Don't worry, you have talent to be a genius! All right, I have to go. Why don't you eat with us? Tomoko, I'm not as free as you, I have an evening job. I also would like to get a job, but my mother... She says for you to focus on painting, right? At any rate, keep on improving yourself. Ah, I can't forget about these. You are an angel for giving it to me. - Give that one to me, too. - This one? - But it's just a rubber. - I don't mind. As long as I can paint, life is both beautiful and fun. Well, so long. Here, Tomoko. Daddy, let me serve you. It's better not to drink today. What? Are you going to stop drinking? Mommy, daddy will stop drinking sake. - No... - Oh my, are you feeling ill? Well, it's my punishment for today. - Did you forget something again? - The umbrella. Daddy is forgetful, just like me! You should face the facts. You're sloppy. It's fine, you can drink today. The bottle is already warm. Really? Thanks for your kindness. Our mother is very kind. Here. Anyway, it was an old umbrella. - You're a sore loser. - Kazuo, you're very rude lately. Oh, the rice is over. Get me the bread, then. - I humbly partake! - I humbly partake! I'll also eat some bread. - There's no need. - Shall I eat it, too? No, it's not needed! I'll eat it alone. - Is that even good? - Yes, it's delicious. "Runaway girl caught," check it out. Are we out of money again? Yes, Mitsuko got sick this month, so we had extra expenses. I should give up sake. Can you do that? But you are working extra... Drinking is not a problem. And I want you to go to work happy. - Is Nobuko singing? - Yes, they are excited for this hour. There are a lot of guys among her friends. Her school is mixed. Hanging out with boys is a status symbol. Will that be all right? What do you mean? She's just 18 years old. Don't worry about her. - It's here. Thank you, bye-bye. - Bye-bye. "Bye-bye..." Weren't you also 18 years old when we got married? 17, by today's standards. You were so young... You are embarrassing me! Mommy, I have to pay the school tuition. Be careful with it. - Don't lose it. - Okay. Hey, you're very late! I came back. Welcome back! How was it? - Just great! - Really? It's a pity that none of you were there. You have to come next time, all right? - Next time, right? - Yes. Oh, there's a school trip next month in the Kansai area. Really? We've already been told the itinerary. Kyoto, Osaka, Nara... If you excuse me now. - Well, good night. - Good night. How many male friends brought you home? - There were three, why? - No, nothing... Good night. Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, huh? More expenses for us. We'll make it through somehow. A trip to Kansai was the most pleasant afterglow from our school years. No, don't touch it. - Are you going to visit Saburo? - Yes. I wish I could go, too... Tell him I'm very busy, please. Here. Take it. Ah, did you make this for me? You don't have time. You haven't even finished the sweater yet, have you? No... thank you. Take these eggs. Hello! Did aunt Kayo arrive? Sister, are you home? Oh! Welcome! Sister, it took me a while, but I finally sold that kimono of yours! Please, come through. Auntie, welcome. Are you leaving now? I really need to talk to you today. But I... Stay for a minute. I'd like to, but I... She has an appointment with a friend. Time is running out, right? Hurry up! Well, auntie, forgive me. Have a good time. - Mommy, I'm leaving now. - Take care. She has become so pretty. Don't you think she looks like a boy? Of course not. You should find a husband for her. Here, take the money. Used kimonos are not worth that much, because there are so many new ones. I only got 3.000 yen for it. Thank you, as always. It's not much, but... - I can't accept it. - You deserve it, and you've come this far... We are sisters, after all. - I guess I have no choice but to take it. - Of course. You are going through hard times, sister. Listen, I wanted to talk to you. Find a husband for Tomoko. What? No way. Why is that? She is not interested. She's doesn't think about marriage yet. You are too soft. She will find a man on her own. What about that man with TB? Are they still seeing each other? Anyways, she's too busy painting. Paintings are useless. Perhaps. But I still think that it's a good thing. She is not a princess. Why don't you find a job for her? You work at home yourself... I would sell all my kimonos so that she could continue painting. Even so, at some point children forget their parents. - You really can't understand it. - Right! A divorced woman like me could not. Say, Kaoko, I wanted to ask you another favor. Can you sell this, too? But isn't this your wedding gift? It's for Nobuko's trip. Tell her to call it off! But I want her to go. I give up... Hello, auntie! - Mommy, can I have a candy? - Yes, of course. Life is not easy, right? All right! I'll take care of it. Shonan Sanatorium - Good afternoon. - Welcome. Mr. Uchiyama is at the edge of the sea. - Is he in good health? - He will be when he sees you! He's down there. At the edge of the sea. What are you doing here? Tomoko How have you been? - I gained weight. - I'm so happy. - And how much? - 300 grams. 300 grams? Here, 300 grams. Well, how's your painting? Did you finish it? Not yet. But I brought it, so you could take a look. Really? I want to see it! Are you sure? Won't you get a fever? - I don't care. - Well, I do! This is our neighbor's garden. - It's making me embarrassed. - Oh, come on! Step aside, let me see. No... No... I'm sorry. You're going to get a fever. It's a very good painting. This time, you'll sure enter the competition. Damn... I can't stand being sick anymore. Don't rush it. But I want to rush it. You have to rest a little. Aren't you tired of waiting for me? I'll get upset. You're being silly, apologize. - I'm sorry. - Say it one more time! My hands are clean. You're being rude. Get better soon. Thank you. Here's chewing gum. And some eggs from my mother. Your sweater is not ready yet. I'll bring it next time. It's so good to be alive. When I came back from the war to the chaos of this country, I became a little nihilistic. I didn't know what to live for. Then, I met you and your family. Life can be joyful and beautiful. Yes. Joyful and beautiful... You have a temperature. Rest a little now. I wish I could recover as soon as possible. There're still so many things I want to do. But I feel bad for you. Oh, such a beautiful flowerpot. Did you plant anything? A tulip. It's a race, to see if I'll be discharged before it blooms. Don't worry, you'll surely win. Which boots will you wear? The older ones. They are totally worn-out. - They will do for the time being. - If only you had the umbrella. I'll be fine in this rain, my jacket is enough. Daddy, why don't you take Kazuo's umbrella? - But how will Kazuo go without it? - I'll give him an old one. - Here. - Your bag. - Have a good day. - Have a good day. Hurry, we're late. Mitsuko, wait. Mommy, these boots are no good. They let water through. You're right. It's time to buy a new pair. Buy some for me, too! Mine get soaked! Right! Right! You can put on father's boots. They're so old! Just try them, okay? Not bad, at all. They suit you well. I look like a duck! It will take me an hour to get to school! Here's the umbrella. I gave yours to father today. Take this one instead. This one is for women! - We're leaving. - Have a good day. Poor things. I need to buy rain shoes for them. Don't worry, mommy! It doesn't rain forever. Look, the sky is already brightening. Working hard? Well, that's an interesting approach. It's quite nice. Such a good composition. I'm also drawing these days, but I'm running out of paint. - Can I borrow some white? - Sure, be my guest. Thank you. How about this one? Can I take it? Help yourself, but they are empty. Squeeze it tight, and you still have some. It is a waste. It's okay for you. You have parents. Take advantage of them as much as you can. There is not much to take advantage of. Excuse me, could you wait a little? Just a little. No way! The boss told me to do it right now! Hey, don't be mean! She's just painting the garden. That's none of my business! What a stupid bumpkin! Who lives here? An old man, all alone. He bought it and moved here. Oh well, I'll paint it from memory. I have it in my head, anyways. "Art is born out of rebellion," right? Well said! Daddy is taking long. Where did he go? Did he stop somewhere on the way? He didn't say anything about it. He is surely stuck at work, doing something. Maybe he is the man who got run over. I saw it in the newspaper. But it can't be him. Don't be silly! Maybe I should go to the station? - Let me go with you. - I'll go, too! Good evening. - Mr. Baba's wife just arrived. - I'm coming. Welcome. Excuse me, did your husband come back yet? Not yet, I don't know why. Is your husband also absent? Indeed. So, they must be at work... My husband said he was busy, but it's so late... Their life is not easy either, and for a salary like that... I don't like to think that maybe life will always be like this. You are lucky, your husband is the department head. That's as far as he goes. I wish I had more money. I can't stand drunkards! Ah, forgive my indelicacy. - Does you husband like to drink? - Yes, he does. My husband almost never gets drunk. - Darling... - Ms. Uemura, I'm sorry, I persuaded him. It wasn't his fault, at all, take it easy on him. - Darling! - Oh, sorry, you're my wife. What are you talking about? Come home immediately! You drank because you lost at mahjong again, didn't you? Welcome back! Hi. Ah, how nice. - You're lively. - What's happened, daddy? - Daddy is drunk... - Yes, he's drunk! - I'm okay! I'm okay! - Isn't that umbrella Mr. Baba's? What? Oh, it's mine. Someone from the office took it by mistake. I'm glad that you didn't forget anything today. Me, forget? Never again! Darling. where's your hat? The hat? My hat... Where is it? See? You forgot it! My, what a troublesome father. It has only been three months since you bought it! I messed up! This is why I don't like drunkards! You'll get run over by a car! - Kazuo and Mitsuko, go to bed. - I'll prepare things for you. Good night! You've been absent for a long time, and we were all worried. Is that so? I'm sorry about that. Actually, I got some good news today and I got too excited. What's the good news? I will get an honorable mention at work. 25 years of service. It will be the day after tomorrow. Ah, I congratulate you for that. - Father, congratulations! - Congratulations, daddy! Thanks. And also... Darling, come here for a second. Are you serious? Daddy, what is it? Daddy's getting a bonus! Really? Oh, that's amazing! We'll be able to buy whatever you want. You just have to pick. - Great! - I'm so happy! - I think I'll buy something, too! - That's right. I am a rich man this month. I'll buy anything for you. Daddy, get a toy piano for me. Very well! - And I need a suitcase for my trip. - Very well. - I want a baseball glove for me. - Very well. I can get spikes for you, too. Thank you very much, dear sir! Darling, are you all right? Do you know how to receive your diploma? Turn to the right. Ah, that's your left. Good, that seems fine. Darling, don't do this... No, I won't. - Daddy, your handkerchief. - Thanks. So, how do I look? Daddy, are you ready? - Are you going with him, too? - Yes. Oh, are you going to deliver your painting already? You will make it this time. Today is a lucky day. - Good luck, sister! - Thank you very much. I hope you're all right. What a rare sight, Kazuo. - Your boots, please. - What a great service! That's it! On my way back, I'll bring your presents. - Good day! - Darling, break a leg! - Have a good day. - I'm going, too. Sister, I wish you good luck. - Have a good day. - We're leaving! Darling... come here. It will only be during the morning, so come later. We'll meet somewhere and go shopping. I'll be waiting for you near your office. - By lunchtime, okay? - Yes. "Honorable Mention to Human Resources Section Chief, Kosaku Uemura." "In the 25 years since he joined this company," "Mr. Uemura has worked with dedication and honesty," "and he was an exemplary employee." "On this occasion, we present him with this prize money." "January 20th of 1951, from Morinaga Company." Occasions like this make me nervous. You could barely noticed it. Oh, you're over here. Did you come, ma'am? Congratulations. Are you going shopping together? We'll leave you two alone. - Thank you very much, gentlemen. - Excuse me. - Shall we go? - Yes. I'm glad you came. I wasn't able to run away... They must be mad at me. Let them be. Today, is a special day. It was a big bonus. 30.000 yen. - Oh god... - It'll help you a little. Not a little, a lot! You can stop working at home, okay? Let's go. You should buy an overcoat. Yours is in a sorry state. This one is perfect. It is 30% off. Not today. I will buy a kimono jacket for you. I've been wanting to buy one for a long time. You don't have to worry about me... - It's okay, let's look for something. - Are you sure? Kimono fabric on sale Welcome. Darling, how do you like this? Do you like this type of cloth? That's so funny. - It's very stylish, right? - Isn't it too bright for me? What do you mean 'bright'? You're really beautiful today! I appreciate your kindness. Listen, darling, let's buy the presents for our children first. Forget about them for a moment. I can't forget them. Not our children. Want me to make you forget? You're being naughty today. Well, then, let's go. Thanks for waiting. Let's have a drink. Cheers! - Congratulations! - Thanks. It's thanks to you. 25 years, huh? You have endured so much. What are you talking about? I didn't do anything. You are a wonderful wife. My, are you drunk already? Have another one. You first. What will I do? My face is already red. That is a good sign. These 25 years have passed so quickly... That's right, we've been married for 25 years already. We'll have a silver wedding this year. When they introduced us, they said that you never drank sake. I'm sorry for that. But still you didn't run away, did you? Imagine that! Not even dead. I'm sorry for the poor life we had to live. No... Today was a really good day. I am a lucky man to have gotten a good wife like you. - No, I've had enough. - I mean it. Excuse me, sir, is this your hat? You forgot it here the other day. Yes, it is! Did I forget it here? Thank you very much. I'm glad that there are still so many good people in this world. - Hey, bring more sake. - Right away. - Darling, will that be all right? - Don't worry, we have enough money. It's not about the money. Everything will be fine, today I have a personal bodyguard. - A questionable bodyguard! - No. Oh, I got stolen! Welcome home, daddy Here you go, Kazuo. Nobuko, make sure it doesn't burn. I think it's enough like this. You're going to give a speech. Did you practice? Dear Dad! Congratulations for the new year! - Without the "good year". - Silly, this is how you do it. "Dear Dad, on this 25th anniversary of your graduation..." It is not "graduation", it is "continuous service". I know that. Service... Continuous! Always in the the same company. Wow, 25 years there and he still isn't the president of the company? Don't be silly! It's not the position in the company that gives value to people. Being the president means nothing. Daddy came back. Welcome back! We're here. - What is it you have here? - Kazuo! Oh, daddy... You have to wait a moment. - We haven't finished preparations yet. - Preparations? Your welcoming party! Oh, I appreciate it. Wait over there in the corner! Over there! It's not ready yet! All right, all right. - We'll call you after we finish. - In the meantime, you sit here. All right. How nice, a party for me. I wonder what they are doing? I'll leave the money in your care. - Darling... - How could this happen? The money is not here. It was with me on the train! It got stolen! Daddy, we are ready! Daddy, no need to wait anymore. Come in. Darling. Let's go, okay? Darling... Oh wait, the gifts. My, how lovely. Look how beautiful it is, daddy. Daddy, take a seat. So, we start the celebration in honor of our father. Pardon the simplicity, please. - Uh... let us celebrate the service... - Continuous. 25 years of continuous service. - Congratulations! - We congratulate you! Daddy, drink! Well, I won't drink today. Have you lost something again? Not at all. Please, darling, drink a little. - Mommy, for you, too? - Yes. Now, it's time for the gifts. - Here's a piano for Mitsuko. - Thank you very much! And next, we have... Darling. - Kazuo, the glove you always wanted. - Wow, great! - Next, we have a suitcase for Nobuko. - I'm so happy, thanks! - And this is for Tomoko. - You have something for me, too? It is an art book by your favorite painter, Mr. Omiya. Thanks. We are rooting for your painting to be accepted. That would be too much luck! The Art of Keiji Omiya - How about it? It's pure leather! - And here's what I have... All right, daddy, let me serve you. Look, this is Dad's honorable mention. "In the 25 years since he joined this company," - "Mr. Uemura has worked with..." - "Dedication." "With dedication and honesty," "and he was an exemplary employee." "On this occasion, we present him with this prize money." Wow, so adults get diplomas, too. Indeed, but it's a very rare thing. Mommy, let's frame it! Right! No, you don't have to show it. It's not a big deal, anyway. Listen, Mitsuko, play something on piano for daddy. But I can't play properly! Everyone hold hands, and let's go home Let's go back home together with the crows When the children come home, They will be greeted by a large round moon When the little birds are all dreaming, The silver stars will shine above the sky Lost... found... Lost... found... Lost... found... Oh, aren't you asleep yet? It's all my fault. I shouldn't have drunk so much sake. No, it was just bad luck. It's not your fault. But it was so much money. Two months' salary... I know that things are difficult for you. I thought it would help. We should have spent it all... And bought you that haori jacket. Yes... But I wanted to save some money for Tomoko's wedding. When Saburo heals, she will marry him. But there is no point in thinking about it. It is better to pretend that the money never existed. The honorable mention that you received is enough. But we need money much more than a piece of paper. What kind of thug would steal from someone like us? A pickpocket doesn't think like that. Well, then. A hot-water bottle? I had one here, too. We have such good children! I'm going to sew some more. You sleep before me. The Art of Keiji Omiya Price - 800 yen Kyoto is a city of temples. I am impressed by the amount. You can buy a lot of interesting things in the city. But, since I have no means, all I can do is sigh. Still, I am very happy, carrying my blue suitcase. Tomorrow, we're going to Nara. I will pray to the giant Buddha, so your painting gets into the exhibition. Signed by Nobuko. It is not bad to be rejected once in a while. The same happened with Cézanne and Van Gogh. Mom is going to be disappointed... So, dedicate yourself even more! Keep trying until you succeed. Sister, it's horrible. Kazuo got hurt! He slipped playing baseball and broke his leg! Mommy, did Kazuo break his leg? Yes, he went to a doctor with father. What should we do now? I think his leg will be fine. I'm sorry. Here, drink some tea. Don't be discouraged, you just have to try again. Everything will be fine. I have to go now. - To the doctor? - Well, yes. Mom, put on your coat. It is very cold today. Really? It's too much work. Don't worry. Be careful or you'll catch a cold! Pawn-shop receipt Want to buy something? What should we do? I have to go, but people come more here at night. I want to stay here a little longer. All right, good luck! This is a big step for you. Art is not for pretty girls. I don't want to be one. Not in the slightest. I was very naive. - And your mother agreed to it? - She doesn't know. I want to quit painting and work. Do you know of any good place? Don't lie! You can't give up. It is part of who you are. Also, if you give up, you will disappoint your your boyfriend. How's he doing? Much better. He might be discharged in spring. Then, spring will come for you, too. You'll get married, paint your pictures... I'm a little jealous. It's not that simple. He will need a job, and we have to find a house, too. It's all or nothing? - Exactly. - Good luck! Hey, miss, could you paint a portrait of me? Yes. Make me look good, okay? It's for a girl I know. Excuse me, can you stand still? You are kind of cute... Do you want to spend the night with me? I know a good place. How about it? I'm not going anywhere! What? You lousy woman, deceiving me! - Welcome back. - Hi. What's up with you all? - Something bad happened, sister. - Huh? Mr. Baba decided to sell this house to our neighbor Kanazawa. I hate that grumpy old man. Being in the red every month is driving me crazy. A little more, and I'll hang myself. Ideally, you should buy the house, but I'm afraid we can't do anything about that. We understand. Mr. Uemura, I'm deeply sorry about this. All the best. - Thanks. - Sorry for bothering you. Did Mr. Baba decide to sell this house? The house is being bought by our neighbor Kanazawa. So, that means we have to leave this house? It is in the contract. But that's absurd! They are evicting us only because it suits them. - How about my school? - And mine, too. It seems that Mr. Baba can't help it, and he is dad's colleague, so we don't want to cause any trouble. So, are we really going to move? We have to move, we have no choice. Now that Kazuo's leg was healing, another thing comes... Good evening! Telegram for Mr. Uemura! They brought a telegram. Who could it be? Who could the telegram be from? Thank you. Sister, it's for you. Is something wrong? Saburo's condition became worse. Saburo? Really? - What happened to him? - He started coughing up blood yesterday. At first, he asked us not to tell you... Sorry I took so long. Try to be brief, please. I was worried about you, that you had become discouraged because of your painting. Don't lose hope. You are destined for success. You don't have to worry about me. Focus yourself on healing soon. I was so happy. I couldn't do what I wanted. But somebody will do it instead of me. Tomoko, keep drawing nice paintings. Together with you. I don't want to be alone. I want to paint with you, okay? I'm finished, you know? No! Don't say that! Life can be joyful and wonderful. We were talking about it the other day. I wonder if Tomoko will be all right? Her painting was rejected, and now poor Saburo has... She must be trying to hide her feelings, but that just makes it harder. I wish I could do something for her. No, let her be. At such times, words of consolation only make the suffering worse. Darling. I'm just going to close the front door. Sorry. How is Tomoko? Did she find a job? Yes, thankfully. She will start on Monday. Thank you for arranging the vacancy. Too bad it is such a small place. But they say he is doing well. I can't believe you're letting her work. You've changed. It wasn't me. She was very determined. And I thought that might help her forget. Working is good, but the best thing would be to marry her. Let the dead be at rest. You know it's not that easy. And we also have to move. Are you really going to move? You should fight! We can't do that. We are neighbors, you know. I wouldn't be able to face them. You too soft-hearted! That's why people step on you. Say, Kaoko, do you know anyone who has houses for rent? My husband's looking for them, but he had no luck yet. Everything we're being offered is too expensive. That's troublesome. Your home for 100.000 yen Tohto Real Estate and Construction We paid half for you to build, and it's been three months. Well, as you know, material costs suddenly went up, and... But that's not what we agreed on. Of course we will build as we agreed, the problem is that we can't buy material with the old prices... Everything changes fast these days. And what will happen now? This is what I want to to talk to you about. If you are in a hurry, you could add a little to the budget... Look, we paid half entrance, as you requested. This is very inconvenient. It's very inconvenient for us, too. How about 30.000 yen more? In any case, be patient, please. We will start soon. When, exactly? We're doing everything we can. Please, be more patient. Please. We're in a bind. Let me ask you again! I am aware of your situation. Well, then, we'll be counting on you. - Hey, Uemura! - Yes, sir? Listen, be more careful of who you allow to let in. Yes. But they came here many times, I felt sorry for them. You are not supposed to pity people. I am a very busy man. Building a house for 50 or 100.000 nowadays is a dream. Something wrong? - But that's written in the ad. - In the ad? That's just made for advertising. Isn't that an hoax, then? An hoax? Nonsense! Be careful what you say! It's just our strategy. We have a business here. And we pay you a generous salary. What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? If you don't like it, you can quit! Yes, I'm listening. What? It's you, sweetie? What? Yeah, yeah. I understood everything. You don't have to worry. Forget that story, let's travel together! Tonight. The train leaves at 8:20 from Shinbashi. Okay! I'm quitting this job! A house for 100.000 yen Really? That's so awful. What a little place Kayo has arranged for you to work on... You don't have to go back there. But, mommy, we need the money. I'm sorry. - I should have just endured it. - What are you talking about? You're not at fault. Since the beginning, I was telling that you shouldn't go to work. Painting should be your first priority. But you're suffering for all of us alone. But you're left to suffer alone... It's not suffering at all. And if it is, it's worth it. But I feel so insecure. Not only about my paintings. I wonder what I'm good for? The Art of Keiji Omiya How can I help you? I would like to talk to Master Omiya, if possible. He doesn't receive anyone when he is painting. I am aware, but I really need to talk to him. I can wait until he finishes his work. All right, you can come in and wait. I'm sorry, but he is still working. Is that so? Sorry for the trouble, then. - Hey, Ono! - Yes, sir. Madam! Master Omiya said he has 5 minutes for you. Really? Thank you. Come with me. In fact, I would like to show you some paintings. They are my daughter's. But, for me, paintings don't exist without the history of the artist who made them. I know I am being terribly inconvenient, but my daughter is suffering so much... I beg you. Just take a look at them. My daughter has always respected you. Your evaluation is really important for her. Even if I can take a look, I won't be polite to her. Art is not about compassion. I understand that. But I still want to ask you to look at them. Well, let's have a look, then. This one was rejected in a competition recently. Do you also think it is bad? Well, I would reject it, too. How about this? What do you think? How about this one? Is this no good, too? It is still amateurish. That one would also be rejected. But you can see she has talent. Actually, this was her boyfriend. But he died recently. Since then, my daughter has lost interest in painting. Sir, do you think that these paintings are a waste of time? Well... I can't say for sure. Based only on these works. It all depends on her zeal. Thank you very much. Sister! Sister, come here for a minute! Look what's in the pot. Come and have a look. Such lovely sprouts. Oh, mommy has arrived. Sister! Mommy is calling for you. Welcome back. I'm home. Where did you take my paintings? To Master Omiya. For what purpose? Did you show him my works? Did he tell you that they're no good? No, he said that everything depends on your zeal. Say, Tomoko. Let me show you something. What do you think this is? Hey, take a look at this. Who do you think painted it? It was me. You, mommy? I liked to paint when I was young. How beautiful! Those mountains... I saw these mountains from the train during a school trip. And can you recognize this? It's a self-portrait. Why don't you paint anymore? Painting was my favorite thing in the world, just like you. I wanted to be an artist. After I got married, your father insisted for me to continue. In the beginning, he did. He was right. You should have kept going. But, being a housewife, things are not so simple. Also, I had you and Nobuko shortly after. We had no money to hire a maid, too. Does that mean you stopped painting because of us? No, that's not what I meant. You know, I saw you painting since you were a little girl, so, when you said you were going to give up your dream to work, I was very sad. I want you to keep going. Although I am very grateful for your wanting to help us, Tomoko, my child, don't worry about us. Just paint. Poor Saburo would be disappointed if he knew that you had given up. But, in fact, I... There were so many rejections, I'm very insecure... That happens to everyone. Nobody can be self-confident all the time. In any case, keep painting. Don't worry about your talent. Do your best and paint something that you find beautiful. Mommy... I will paint your portrait. My portrait? I will do my best. Will you pose for me? Just a little bit, okay? Otherwise, I'll get hungry later. May I come in? Wait a little bit. Welcome! Excuse me, but Mr. Kanazawa wanted to see what the house looks like. Could we? Is that so? It's a mess, but make yourselves at home. You can come. - Did something happen? - No, nothing. Continue your work, please. The kids messed it up a bit, but it's a very nice room. This way, please. Here's the living room. - Oh, are you changing the door's paper? - Yes, I am. Let's head to the dining room. Oh my, excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm a little busy, but feel free to come in. Tomoko is passionate about painting. The garden is through here. It's a good thing that the weather is so fine today. Listen, I saw that they are changing the paper doors, but... Mr. Kanazawa's relatives will be moving here soon. It's important that you leave the house by the date we agreed on. I know. We are moving to my sister's house. It's just that the paper on the doors was so old, we didn't want to displease the new residents. Well... I'm counting on you. Well, Tomoko... You shouldn't be distracted by little things. The painting has to be ready in time for the exhibition. I always wanted to submit a painting here. I am very happy that you will make my dream come true. But I'm always being rejected... Don't think like that. You did your best, and that's enough. I'm sorry for kicking you out like that, chief. No, we all have our priorities. - It's okay, I'll finish it. - Really? See you later, then. Good-bye. - Hey, don't forget this. - Yes, thanks. I'll be going now. - Madam, all the best. - Thanks for your help. - There's so many things here. - They really are. We think that we don't buy anything, but it is quite a lot. These things are worth nothing, but it's a shame to throw them away. - Do you have a free box? - A box? Give me one minute. Darling, look at this. - Which one? - This one. Wow! Tomoko painted this at the age of five. It was on New Years Day. - There, in the balcony. - That's right. Those trees were very small at the time. I couldn't imagine that we'd have to leave this house. At this age, and I still don't have a house, and I only cause you grief. Forgive me, darling. Mitsuko, you have to throw some things away. Auntie's house is small, there will be no space. But I need this. This is terrible! How are we going to fit in two rooms? - Don't complain. - But, I... I don't want to move out! - Me neither. - Me, too. Tomoko, do you have a minute? - I have some news! - What is it? - Your picture was accepted! - What? I just found out! It was unanimous! Congratulations, Tomoko. You did it, at last. And what about you? Me? Well, they declined it. It's all right. Why cry over spilled milk? Don't worry about me. Hurry up! Make your mother happy! Mommy! Mommy, I was accepted! My painting was accepted! Really, Tomoko? Mommy... Well, let's raise the glasses for our Tomoko! - Congratulations, Tomoko! - Thanks. - I congratulate you, sister! - Me, too! Tomoko, don't you want to have a drink too? What's wrong, Tomoko? No. I just wanted to show my appreciation. But it is you two who deserve to be congratulated. It was all thanks to you. Hey, Nobuko. Kazuo and Mitsuko, too. Let's show our appreciation to mother tonight. This was all thanks to her efforts. I'm living in this world for such a little time, but I understand well how hard it is to live in it. But Mom and Dad lived in it for years and years. They stood firm and took care of us, so that we could be who we are today. Tomoko! That's enough, you don't have to say anymore. We're celebrating today! Today is our last day in this house. Let's sing and have fun, okay? How about it, Nobuko? Sing something for us. I'll sing. Every year, when I return to my homeland The flowers are blooming, the birds are singing, the breeze is blowing Even the murmur of the stream beneath my window It's the same as always. Only I am... Excuse me. - It's Mr. Baba's wife. - What does she want? - Good night. - Thanks. Mr. Baba's wife has brought a letter from Mr. Kanazawa. From Mr. Kanazawa? - Are they insisting that we go out? - What a stubborn old man. - What did he write? - Well, read yourself. Mother, what does it say? Oh my, what a relief! - What does it say, sister? - It says that we don't need to move! - Is this true, mommy? - He's going to let us stay here! Yay! I'm not changing schools! I'm relieved, as well! I wouldn't be able to handle all of you at home! But the good news aren't over yet, Tomoko. That painting you did, of his garden? He asked if you don't want to sell it to him. No, give it to him for free. For free! Yes. Well, Nobuko, keep singing. Yes. Let's sing together. Kazuo, Mitsuko. And you, too, sister. "Home, sweet home". One, two, three. Our house's floor is made of earth We are not envious of the precious stones We have the peaceful spring sky, We have the flowers, and the birds are our friends Home, sweet home Our home is a happy one Here, we are safe HOME SWEET HOME THE END
