I finally found a boring but comfortable job. I worked in a billiard hall. CAIRO, 1968. - Why are you late? - Student protest on the road. The new chief inspector is here. - Does he want something? - He's just playing. Hello, Omar. Hello. Congratulations. I hear you've been promoted. Are you here to play? No, I work here. Didn't you know? I thought you guys know everything. Why don't you practice law? Would the guild have me? The bribe accusation was serious. They probably wouldn't. By the way. If we meet again, address me as 'Mister Omar'. We're not colleagues anymore. I bore this dull and austere life, as I bore jail, waiting for an event that I felt was coming. I observed the world I left like one who never lived in it. I had lost the ability to express my feelings. I had no friends or family. I kept to myself. I was content with superficial, meaningless relationships. Here's the paper. Get me some tea. "Major general Mohammad Maamoun" "died yesterday of a sudden heart attack". One question had haunted me since I started this new life: Had I made the right decision? - Why am I here? - Just following orders. Listen, Yahya. This is a top secret meeting. The minister chose not to be here to ensure there would be no leaks. We've investigated you thoroughly, including your academic days, and your family history. We studied your personality carefully. We analyzed your behavior under duress, and your moral fiber. For example, the way you recuperated your stolen gun. Also, the way you refused to be bribed. Not only did you refuse the bribe. You reported it immediately. There are other examples. There was a report against me. The report clinched our decision. Others would not have dared to go against the minister. We want to recruit an officer for a highly sensitive mission. The mission is to implant an agent in the hierarchy of the drug trade. The goal of the mission is to infiltrate their organization and reveal its connection to others such as the weapons trade and the smuggling of ancient artifacts. You will also expose corrupt cops. Your mission will last your entire lifetime. The police will not protect you. You will be treated as a drug lord, a criminal. You're to rise in their organization and reach its deepest secrets. You will then feed us that information. Two people will be in the know: The minister of interior, and the chief of intelligence. They will pass the secret to their successors. This will never be mentioned in any record. You will receive a certificate signed by both to be placed in a bank safe. Your mission code name is 'Land of Fear'. It will end with your death. If you are ever found guilty of crimes, or even given the capital punishment, the statement will save you. You will first transfer to general intelligence. You will pretend you are a corrupt anti-drugs policeman. You will gradually get in trouble. If you are offered a bribe, accept it. You might go to jail. This will be your gateway to the crime world. You will be tainted with crime. You won't be simply pretending you're corrupt. You will truly live your corruption. You will be truly a drug dealer, truly a criminal. Deep in the recesses of your mind, you shall remain a police officer. You will betray, and kill, and steal, and poison, and the police will hound you. This is a hard mission. Your life will be arduous, with two simple joys: The thrill of adventure, and the pursuit of a noble goal. Your life will be reorganized. You will assume a new corrupt personality. We will send you to the Land of Fear with a new code name: Adam. All done, wiseguy. Call me that again, and I'll kill you. I was asked to leave my life for a more turbulent one. A life of doubt, and fear, and death. Keep out of it. Calm down. Continue your game. Get them some drinks. Get out of my way. Enough. Don't just hit randomly. Use your head. You're wasted in this place. Call me, I have a better job for you. THE NIGHTLIFE. May God protect you from the evil eye. Tell Yahya to come in. Come in, sir. Any news? The hall is full, and so are the pockets. We're going to make a killing. Give me a smoke, and tell them to hurry up. Here you go. Excuse me. The basha wants to greet Rabab. She is not accepting guests. Come on. This guy is rolling in dough. Sorry, not a chance. Tell her. - What is it? - Nothing, sir. She's still getting dressed. Basyouni was a big drug dealer. I hated him the moment I saw him. He had a bad reputation. He brutally removed obstacles in his way. - A car is following us. - Two cars. They're catching up. Lock the doors. Drive away if you can. Stay here. Good evening. Did you think I'd let that pass? Don't you know who I am? Who doesn't know you, sir? Get out of my way. - No. - Says who? Her bodyguard. Very good. Move it. We appreciate that you did not name anyone to the police. The basha sends this gift with his regards. Stay seated. There's no need for this. He can rest assured. He may shoot my other leg if he'd like. Meaning? I mean nothing. It's all in the past. Let's forget about it. Excuse me. 10 thousands pounds, you fool. Why didn't you tell the police? What good would that do? Drop Yahya off. - Ever been married? - No. I have. I was fifteen. I ran away a year later. I told my mother to get me a divorce. He wouldn't divorce me. And then? I started dancing. I made a lot of money. I paid him 500 pounds. He divorced me. Now marriage scares me. You know I bought the Moulin Rouge 3 months ago. It's almost ready. Wanna run it? Let me finish. If you want to, we'll marry. I'll own it, and you'll run it for me. You want to marry me because you need a manager? I need a man I can count on. You're a man, and a good one. We're together anyway. I love you, you stupid man. I did not love Rabab, but I really wanted to marry her. That is when I realized that the old Yahya did not love her, but that wiseguy Yahya wanted to marry her. Madame, wake up. It's 3 PM. Good morning. Breakfast is ready. Wake up already you lazy bum. Come on, get up. What's this? What happened? When the chief of intelligence died, I did not know who inherited my secret, but when the May 15 purge eliminated the old guard, I knew who now held my secret. I was afraid I'd fall through the cracks during those turbulent times. The man you are mocking used to be very influential. He'd spend 100 pounds a day. Who said otherwise? I'm just saying he's an old man now. Beware of speaking ill of people. My aunt used to say: Speak ill of people, and they'll speak ill of you. Who would dare do that, you dog? Don't be upset, boss. - But they do talk. - What do they say? I can't say. Speak, fool. They say Yahya is a kept man. Shut up. It's OK. What else do they say? Am I not the manager? They know you are, and yet they talk. - What else? - They say you are a punk. They say you're being cheated on. You mean to say I'm... I know you aren't. But people like to gossip. People gossip about me too. They say I'm a fruit. Aren't you a fruit? "Fruit" means a gay man, right? I'm not a man to start with. What to do? We must change people's perceptions. How? You find another job. - Quit the cabaret? - No. Change your image. They say you always get beaten, and you never hit back, like that time with Basyouni. That's the word on the street. You should wear a veil. It's the style now. What will you do? Me? I don't know. If you stopped dancing, and he changed his ways, I'd still be gay. I can't change that. I'll find another dancer, another band, and another woman will hit me with her sandal. You son of a dog. Lola was right. To enter the underworld, I needed a reputation. I did not have that reputation yet. The door was still shut to me. Yes, dear? I've noticed something. - What is it? - The smell of smoke. - It's not a big deal. - Yes, it is. I was not born yesterday. You'll selling drugs. This has to stop. Come in. I'm leaving. This is the last time I mention this. Something to drink? - What is it? - I... Can we speak outside? Of course. You know my son Mohammad. He's my eldest, my right hand man. He's my only heir. God damn them. He'll get out of it, I'm sure. The lawyers say it does not look good. The judge is a problem. Should you change lawyers? No, they're the best there is. I wish I could do something. - You can. - Me? The trial is in a month. It will be his last chance. He must escape. What can I do? You're wiseguy Yahia. You used to know them well. I can't do it myself. Security will be tight. It's his last chance. Either he makes it, or he dies. You know their ways, don't you? Yes, but... It's been a while. Ask around. You have connections. Come up with a plan. - How much will you pay? - A hundred thousand. Just do it. Your son had money on him when he got caught, right? Yes, a million pounds. - Didn't he offer it to the officer? - He did. - What happened? - It didn't work. The officer turned it down. Crazy fool. The officer refused a million pounds, and you're offering me 100,000? Did I get that right? Can you do it? Maybe. How much? - 2 million. - Are you insane? Not at all. Anyway... I can't accept any less. I don't have it. - Pay me in merchandise. - Merchandise? How will you sell it? You're going to help me sell it. You want in on the game, don't you? Today I took my first step towards the drug trade. The goal is to rescue Al Manzalawi during his trial. I must ensure a certain corrupt officer is on the scene on that day. I'll stage the escape of another inmate under his watch. He'll catch him, and his name will be in the headlines. Make sure he is assigned to Manzalawi for the trial. Yours truly, Adam. OFFICER ABED EL TAWWAB REWARDED. Nice to see you. - That man was tedious. - Yes. What's this? Good evening. - What is it? - You got the message? The goods? I mean the message. 2 million, like you asked. The message is: 'if you mess around, I'll get to you.' I can't leave it in the house. No worries. We'll keep it for you. Call me tomorrow. I told you I won't tolerate this. You'll leave the house and take it with you. You can come back if you give it up. If you don't, I'll divorce you. Take a right. Did you hear me? Hello Abou Khalil. Here are the keys. The plane ticket, and the passport. - Count your money. - No need. Bring him over. Open up. Go inside. Turn around. Don't peek. Not even me? Especially not you. You're naughty. Hurry up, turn around. Fine, turn around. Take her. Go with them. In order to become a drug lord, I had to be feared. I had to commit a spectacular act of violence. I had to do it with my own hands. However, I must confess that I drew personal pleasure from killing Basyouni. This is how wiseguy Yahya became wiseguy Yahya, the drug lord. CAIRO, 1981. Go to the cars. Where to? Mister Ibrahim? Let's go downtown. Downtown it is. Welcome. Welcome, mister Rajab. Thank you. You've heard of these men, but don't know them. Mister Manzelawi, in control of El Sawahiliyah. The lake is his personal property. He knows every fish, its name, age, and address. Mister Houdhoud, emperor of Al Batiniyah. A son of the land. Always ready to do a favor to a friend. Mister wieseguy Yahya. Cunning and wise. On top of that, he used to be a cop. Honest and clean. I am Ibrahim El Hout, at your service. Where shall we go? The Nile Hilton. If you were to move 1 million pounds worth of pot, you'd need a truck. There is a good chance the police finds it. Right? Moreover, what is the percentage of pot that is intercepted at the border? Many problems. Consider The consumer, the pot smoker. When the price goes up, he reduces his consumption. If it is hard to procure, he stops buying it. What profit do you make? 100%? One pound for each invested pound? I'm not even mentioning the problems of storage... What's the point, buddy? I mean mister Rajab. I mean to say that pot is not worth it. What shall we sell then? Home appliances? We want a 500% profit rate. A substance that is easy to move. It could be hidden inside a tire. Once you try it, you're hooked. You always come back for more. Powder. I am talking about powder. This is the future. This bag will bring you 100,000 pounds, and it can fit in a suitcase instead of a van. What does a million get us? 5 million. One million of powder nets you 5 million. We'd be criminals. What do you think we are? There are limits. It's not the same. True. The profit won't be the same either. Same difference between pot and appliances. Am I not right? There are things you do not know. I started when I was ten years old. I'd keep an eye on the road while playing soccer. I then started delivering merchandise. Then I started delivering on a lager scale, in many areas. I would deliver an ounce of pot for a shilling. I'd hide it in a loaf of bread among 5 loaves. I'd give my mother the 4 loaves, and eat the one that had the pot myself. To keep this short, I then became a distributor. I started off with a few ounces, and became a big dealer eventually. My crew grew to a thousand men. You have descended upon us from nowhere. You're too haughty to sympathize with your customers. You'll never meet them or talk to them. Understand? You may be willing to poison people, but I'm not. I understand, but we'll need your boys. You don't speak to me like this. Listen, boy. Go and tell your bosses that if they move against me, they're dead. My fortune, or should I say wiseguy Yahya's fortune, had greatly increased. I was one of Egypt's wealthiest men. My business had diversified into many industrial and commercial ventures. And yet, I felt an emotional void. I had reached middle age, and I had never been in love. I made love many times, but never felt it. I was in a loveless marriage. I divorced Rabab with no regrets. We never had a child. This childlessness reflected my double life. I wanted to be a father as officer Yahya, not as drug lord wiseguy Yahya. Hold the lift. I was no longer sure of my true identity. Was I really a police officer, or was I a drug lord? Did you see that girl? Find out everything about her. Farida was an architect and a college instructor. She graduated from Paris. Her office was in my building. The decrease of drug prices in the market reflects a decrease in the risk of the trade. The percentage of confiscated drugs has dropped to 3%. There are many new players that I have listed in a previous report. They are not traditional drug lords. They come from the world of legal business. They have entered the trade from the top, not the bottom. This is unprecedented. A major shift is occurring in the market. Finally, it has been years since I embarked on this mission. The people who assigned me this mission are no longer with us. I do not know who is in charge anymore. Therefore, I have an unusual request. I would like to meet my handlers face to face. I have alluded to this in the past, and received no answer. I am corresponding with people who are unknown to me. I feel like I am conversing with a mute wall. I have started to wonder if anyone is reading my reports, or if I have slipped through the cracks. To establish the meeting, I propose the following: A notice is to be published in the papers stating the following: You go down. Good evening. I am... I want to build a house. At this time of night? Isn't it too late? You see, the door was open, so... You're mister Yahya, right? Coffee? - Sure. - Give me a minute. I am done. A building, right? Anything. Anything? What do you feel like? You won't believe me. Perhaps a peasant's hut. Great. A peasant's hut it is. In such a posh area? Build whatever you want. A villa, a castle, a mosque, a shelter. Whatever you want. Mister Yahya, what do you want? Nothing. What do you want to build? You decide. A small villa. The land is too large. A big villa, then. Do you think that this is my price? I wish you had one. It would be easy then. You're priceless. Those days, I felt a great vitality. A sun was shining bright and lighting up my life. I was in a peculiar state. I had carte blanche to commit any act I wanted, including acts against laws and morality. Only the mission counted. I bought and I sold. I seduced and I killed, and I got very rich. All this for one lofty goal. The goal absolved me of sin but did not shield me from making mistakes. Therefore, committing sins was easier than making mistakes. My isolation in the land of fear had pushed me to ask for help. Just as I was losing hope, help came. "To the one who wants to reminisce over the past," "call this number". - Hello. - Moussa? I read the notice. - I'd like to meet. - What's you name? - Adam. - Understood. You're Adam from the old days? Yes. It's been 10 years now. Tell me more about yourself. I get so many calls from people who want to buy and sell old watches. - I asked to meet because... - Never mind. How do we meet? Must we meet? I need to see you. Shall we meet in 2 hours? At 5:00? Do you know the Sultan Hassan mosque? You... You have kids? I'm sorry. Do not tell me anything. I don't want to know. What can I do for you? I want to make sure my reports are useful. I wouldn't know. How come? I know nothing. I want to know nothing. When I started the mission, I saw things clearly. I was sure of myself. Eventually, I started feeling like I was looking through a glass. A layer of dirt started forming on the glass, and it got thicker and thicker. I could not see anymore. Things got hazy. Memories... Mixed with dreams... Mixed with illusions... I've been having nightmares. I'd wake up in a panic. I feel doomed to loneliness. I'm hanging in the air. My feet can't touch the ground. I'm asking myself: What have I become? A killer, an outlaw. Everything I once despised, I've become. I accepted to become a criminal. If there's something I can do... I do not know what I can do. Is what I'm doing right or wrong? Is it of any use? Should I go on? These are questions I do not have the answer for. I'm not asking you. I'm asking the superiors. If you don't know, ask them for an answer. Ask them? I'll call you back. The meeting with Moussa troubled me. I was filled with suspicions. I started to feel as if I was living an illusion, as if the mission was a figment of my imagination. We hereby declare that lieutenant Yahya is working for the good of the nation. His mission is highly unorthodox. Beginning in the year... It shall last his entire lifetime. He has full amnesty. This includes profits he makes during his mission. - Good morning. - Hello. - Coffee? - Sure. Didn't sleep either? Will you marry me? Sugar with your coffee? Will you marry me? I think not. I do not know you. You're rich, very rich. But who are you really? I do not know. You mind I'm rich? The design of the villa will be ready in 3 days. I'll stop by tomorrow. - Think about it. - I'm traveling later today. I think that Farida sensed the paradox in my life. I longed for a simple life. A life with no secrets and no mystery. I was trying to flee the nightmare I was living. A contradiction between my feelings, my actions, and reality. Welcome, sir. We are honored. The boss is expecting you. Mister Houdhoud. Follow me, please. Welcome. So nice to see you. I am glad you're here. I am honored by your presence. We're like brothers, though I knew you weren't going to visit. Once I knew you were nearby, I told the boys to fetch you. Forgive me. Where's your car? It's nearby. Good. If you'll allow it, ditch your car. We have special guests. If you don't mind, send your men away and stay here. Just do as I say. The police is about to raid the neighborhood. You go now. No just yet. We have time. Please. Please. Those are your men? They are all my men. Those who were caught, and those who weren't. God will provide. He provides for the bird in the sky, and the ant on the ground. He will provide for us too. The fisherman can't go home empty-handed. The same with the police. They have to catch someone. Even the arrested ones, God will take care of them. Welcome, sir. We are honored. This is the house of the old man who was arrested. Mister Houdhoud? I want to sing, but I am ashamed. - Sing when my husband is in jail? - Sing, woman. Your husband was an ailing old man. I'll get you a younger one. Your daughter is getting married next week? She was supposed to. She shall get married. I will take care of all expenses. She's like my daughter. Do not worry about a thing. I'll be a father to her until he comes back. Take this. God bless you. Goodbye. You barely ate a thing. What's wrong? You're tired. Tell me. You are a big boss, an important trader, a drug lord, but you're not at ease with it. You're like one swimming in his business suit. It won't do. Each profession requires a unique way of life. What to do? You can do a lot. Live your life. Swim with the current. Learn how to live. Are you married? Get married. Have children. Wanna get married now? - How? - Nothing to it. Go to Anawati. Tell him his daughter is getting married. The wedding is tonight. Let him fix her up. Tell him to come here. Get a priest too. Don't worry. It's all above board. You can divorce her tomorrow if you want. The dowry's 10,000. Plus 20,000 to terminate the marriage. Good morning, groom. - That was quite the trick. - Enjoy yourself. I'll have to leave you alone for a while. - I'll come with you. - Why don't you stay here? Where are you going? You want to come? When mister Yahya came, the whole place knew, right? Yes. Everyone thought he left at nighttime, right? Yes. Except you and 3 others. Yes. How did the police find out then? I swear to God, boss... Watch out. Listen, son. The other 3 men were locked up in a room. Here they are. They haven't been anywhere. You went home at night, which means you were the one who told the cops. Boss, I swear on the holy book... Shut up. Look here. You're still young. You're learning. This is the last time you do this. If you do it again, you're done for. Got it? You told them? Who did you tell? Alaa? Yousri? Be a man. Don't be scared. Tell me, damn you. Demote him to lookout. Salary of a boy. Who was it? Yousri? Why did you do it? Do you need money? Forgive me, boss. I owe everything to you. They said they'll pardon my brother. My mother cries all day long. - He might get the chair. - Damn you and your mother. The chair, you dog? Your brother is not worth the trouble. Move it. Shame on you. Go to the car. Get lost. Move it. See the disgrace? Killing one's own is the hardest thing to do. Sometimes, we must kill. God created each of us for a purpose. He made us drug dealers to give pleasure to people. He made us rich. All this money is God's, not ours. We're just keeping watch over it. There are no roses with no thorns, no heaven with no hell. God assigned us certain duties, and burdens we must carry. He decreed that we sometimes must kill. I believe that killers get killed. I know I will be killed. That is the price that I must pay. Why are you crying? I love you. What? I love you. Why are you sad about it? Because... I know you will leave me. - What's your name? - Hana. Come. I knew you'd come. Nice roses. Hurt your finger? Did you sleep with someone? I haven't slept in 3 days. Look at the board. I knew you'd come. With every sound, I'd wonder if it was you. GREEK ISLANDS, 1982. You have nice taste, wiseguy. You're a sly fox. You lucky bastard. Why don't you pay attention? Please continue. What to do? What to do? Can't you keep your boys in line? Shall I do it for you? What kind of boss are you? What can I do? My boys are being offered 5 times what I pay them. That's not it. They're luring the boys with the product. Shall we assign guards to keep watch on our boys? Powder is everywhere in the market. It has many customers. The dealers are a sight to behold. Clerks, college students, hair dressers. It's crazy. Some bosses. Lucky you. You can swim. - Why don't you? - He'd kill me. The first time he saw me, I was in a bikini. I was a flight attendant. It was in Paris. He saw me in a hotel. He thought I was a foreigner. He said in Arabic: "What a nice broad". I answered in Arabic. He was embarrassed. You never swim? I do, but not in front of the men. His first wife is there. She's a terror. She gossips all day long. Is Yahya already married? That's crazy. Maybe he is. Don't worry about it. Watch out for him. You can't trust men. Excuse me. Isn't she ashamed? In front of the men? She's a tramp. You should blame her man. You know Omar Assyouti? I do. Know him well? We graduated the same year. He'll be in charge of the anti-drug force. Can we bribe him? He's a good officer. He'll be a problem. Here's your wife. By the way, your wife is pregnant. Pregnant how? There's a baby in her belly. How do you know? Her father told me. - You mean Hana? - Yes. Who else? Your old wife. Why so quiet? Keep talking. What do you do anyway? What's funny? What do you think? I don't know. I'll tell you. I own a textiles factory. Also a leather shoes factory. A couple of cement plants. 800 transport cars, 25 buildings, 100 acres, and some villas. That's all, I think. Do you get it? I got it. It's clear. What do we do? You're drug dealers. Is she serious? Never leave the house alone. I'm assigning you 2 bodyguards. Skip work for a while. We're moving tomorrow. What is going on? What is going on? A power struggle. Who are you people? Who are you? A drug lord. The war started. It was unprecedented in the underworld. In addition to the massacre, Daldoul died, allegedly from suicide. I've never met a suicidal drug lord. Another drug lord disappeared on his way to his apartment. He left no trace. There is a cover-up, an attempt to hide the extent of the murders. The execution of these crimes points to a sophisticated actor. In summary, this is a war to impose heroin on the market. This war is being enabled by some powerful party. Adam. Welcome. We're honored. If we knew you're coming, we would have rolled out the red carpet. I'm sorry I did not visit earlier. The men have something for you. Open it. 2 million. We'd like some merchandise. What kind? Powder, of course. What else? You can keep the money until we deliver the drugs. There's no need. I appreciate it. We'll send you a batch for half the sum, and the rest in a month. The boss said you're not to leave alone. Can you step into the other car? - I'm taking this one. - They'll go with you. - I'm going alone. - Please, mam. Good morning. By the way, you can now come and go as you please. What if I escape? I'll find you. Stop being a child. I'm trying to protect you because I love you. Good morning. - How are you? - I'm working. What's this? A new car to replace the one you wrecked. - Nice car. - Congratulations. Come on. Hurry up. Didn't you get it to sleep with me? Come on. Here I am. I knew that our relationship soured when she found out the truth. She asked for a divorce. I said no. I am sure that in a few years, who knows how many, she'll realize I did not deceive her, and that I lied when I said I was a drug lord. The police are here with a search warrant. Let them in. The police are searching the office. Call me when they're done. Call the lawyer. Tell him to file a complaint. They want to search the car. The police increased its harassment. The periodic searches made me wonder. Was it the murders? Or Omar's recent appointment? - Find anything? - No. Dog. - Good evening. - Hello. Why is the door open? You know. Farida. I'm tired. I need you. You don't need anyone. Let go of me. Please. What have you done? I braced myself for the worse. It came faster than I thought. An arrest warrant. A message from the lawyer. - Officer Omar called him. - What for? He wants to meet you. He promises not to arrest you. Why? The lawyer asked. He said it was personal. What does he think? He's not sure. It's up to you. - I'll meet him in 2 days. - OK. Hello, Omar. So? Let's take my car to a public place. Shall we? Listen. If this is a trap, I will kill you. A trap? No. I made a promise. What is it? Doesn't Cairo look nice from up here? Just as we can see it, it can see us as well. What do you want? This is tedious. But I know this will pass. Nothing lasts forever. One day you will leave your post. That's true. I know. That's why I must end you before I leave. You can't even manage to arrest me. I canceled the arrest warrant. Here's the order. If somebody stops you, show this to them. You don't want money, I think. You know me well, and you can tell a clean cop from a dirty one. Am I corrupt? You are free. You no longer have any issues with the police. Why? Look here. As we're talking, several things are happening. First, your men saw us sitting together with no protection. How would I trust you? Second, I canceled the arrest warrant. The news will be in the papers tomorrow. Third, the entire anti-drug task force is raiding all the other drug lords. We've been planning this for 3 months. A lot of care has gone into it. Everyone except you. We won't get near you. How would this be interpreted? One more thing. All our informants will start spreading a rumor: That you're the source of all our information. The rumor also says that you continue to collaborate with us. The price for your collaboration is known. Total amnesty. Got it? I'll let you be, but the drug lords won't. They will kill you. He's dead. To the cars. Quick. What is happening? It's all good. Who are you? Moussa. What do you do? I'm employed by the post office. - What? - The post office. - You're with the ministry of interior? - No. Intelligence? I am just a humble functionary in the post office. How about the justice ministry? No connections. My son is trying to join though. Where do I come in? Why did you meet me? As I said, I work in the post office. About 15 years ago, I was assigned a task. I was to pick up messages from an address and deliver them to another. It was done by the book. I would clear the mail just like any other. Upon delivery, I would get a receipt. This system worked for 4 years without a hitch. I was then informed that the destination address changed. I was given the new address. The missives continued to be delivered. I forgot one thing. I noticed that the letters all shared the same handwriting. They were all sent from Cairo, from different places. The letters were few and far between. - And then? - That's all. That system lasted 2 years. Then, once, we found the place closed. - What place? - The destination address. The letter was returned. We tried again. Again, no one was there. We first thought they were away on summer vacation. A whole year went by. I visited the district chief. God rest his soul. I told him about it. He told me that the letters were a very high priority. He urged me to keep trying to deliver them. Finally, one day, the mailman told me he found the office open. The person in question was not there though. He had moved. Nobody knew where he went to. At that time, the district chief had retired. I was not sure what to do, so I visited the director. He told me to follow regulations: Return the letters to the sender. But there was no return address. He told me to destroy them. - Did you do it? - No. I knew there was something special about those letters. It did not feel right to destroy them. What if the sender asked for them? I'd then be in trouble. I decided to keep them. I postponed destroying them. I tried my best to get more information about the sender, to no avail. Last year, I was promoted. I was torn on what to do with all the letters. I thought to myself, before destroying them, why not read them? I opened the first letter. It was strange. The name of the recipient was Moussa. Great God. My name is Moussa as well. I felt that it was more than a coincidence. It was destiny. Go on. I didn't understand the letter. I read the others. I didn't get a thing. I sensed it was important though. You wrote them, right? Go on. You know the contents, right? In the last letter, I found a request to contact Moussa. I followed the instructions. God chose me to contact you. I said: "Let it be". I do not know why God chose me for this mission. I put the notice, and you contacted me. I wanted to tell you everything, but I couldn't. When you contacted me again, I decided to tell you everything. Can I help you in any way? So all this time, I was writing the letters for you? I only meant well. This is a mosque. Get up. God is great... I won't kill you, but you will do as I say. I want to help you. - Do you still have them? - Yes. Deliver the to the interior ministry, to Omar Assyouti, the anti-drug officer. Tell him everything you just told me. Got it? Show me your card. Is that your address? Yes, what else would it be? Still have the same phone number? Here. I swear to God if you don't do as I say, I will kill you. Understood? They've been interrogating me for hours. I know nothing. You don't? How is that possible? I know just what I told you. I am just a messenger. I delivered the message, and told the truth. My only mistake was that I read the letters, and sympathized with the sender. I believe you. Thank god. We need to know the sender. I don't know. I didn't want to know. Did you write those letters? Why would I do that? How would I know all this? I was just the messenger. Moussa died. I realized that I truly admired this simple man. He died before telling me what Omar said. I was hounded by the entire drug world for weeks. My men all left me. Some fled, and others died. Wanna eat something? I'm not hungry. Hana. Tell Houdhoud I want to see him. He won't save us. Tell him I am on my way. Boss, be reasonable. I came to you. I am glad you did. I was afraid you'd die before I saw you. I want to know something. Did you kill Rajab and Ibrahim? Yes. Idiot. The first time we met Rajab, when Ibrahim brought him along, I glanced at you for a second. I saw true hate in your eyes. You hated him like death. A person hates death, and fears it, but respects it. But you hated Rajab, and despised him. I was surprised. I thought you were odd. I started paying close attention to you. I felt you held many secrets within you. You were detached. The difference between you and me was that my long life was a burden for me. I couldn't just switch to their side. But you were a young, unburdened man. You could do it. You did what I would have done if I was still young. You turned out to be an idiot, and I was foolish. What it the relationship to what is going on today? You have the right to ask. The murder of Rajab and Ibrahim is the source of it all. All you deserve now is a bullet through the head. Those two were part of worldwide organization. We're small fish. The big boys are abroad. They plant, and harvest, and manufacture, and export. We just distribute. Rajab and Ibrahim represented them. If they die, they're replaced. But if they're killed, their murderer must pay the price. I could not believe it when they told me it was you. I thought you were cunning. That was not cunning. Not cunning at all, mister wiseguy. I did not inform on anyone. I don't work for the police. The police wants to get us, and we hate it, but we understand each other. The story about you being an informer was transparent. Any boss would have understood the message though. What message? A message from above, from far away. They're saying they will not rest until you are annihilated. You have to die for us to live. It is an objective truth. I won't kill you. I don't know why. Maybe because I'm flawed. Only God is flawless. My flaw is that I loved you. My advice for you is to leave Egypt. Flee. They will not show mercy. If I see you again, I will kill you. I realized that my mission was over. It was time to depart the land of fear. It was time to go back to the old life I had almost forgotten. "Amnesty also covers all the wealth he's accumulated, regardless of the source". "The wealth may also be inherited by his descendants". "Signed by..." I can't believe this. You think I forged it? Maybe. What about Moussa? A crazy man. Let's assume what you say is true. What difference does it make? Your life is still in danger. You must change your name and leave Egypt. You're a shrewd man with means. You know I'm right. Why not just do it? So die a drug lord? That does not matter. Just go abroad. And if I refuse? I'd have to arrest you on the charge of dealing drugs. I'll share your document with my superiors. They'll decide what to do. I'll be in jail in the meantime? And by the time you've decided, I'd be dead. - That's it. - But why? Is it jealousy? Or don't you want to admit you failed? Or is it because Ibrahim and Rajab are dead? You know? You know why I won't kill you? I often doubted myself. Am I a policeman, or am I a drug lord now? The truth is that there is still a small part of me that is a cop. Wiseguy Yahya is a drug lord, no matter what they say. You killed, and you sold drugs. You're acting like Satan. When God told him to serve Adam, he refused, and became the devil. I wondered whether you'd try to kill me. My mission ended. The authorities told me my life was in danger. They assigned me a bodyguard. Similar to Houdoud, they advised me to leave Egypt. I refused. One day, I met Farida on the street. I did not know she was back in Cairo. We met as strangers. We were curious about what had become of us. Still leaving the door open? We met often, as if we were encountering each other in a foggy world. Our relationship was going on aimlessly, with no end in sight. We did not know where we were going, or how it would end. I kept seeing Hana. I felt love for my son, Younis, in spite of our circumstances. I could not help but reminisce on the life of wiseguy Yahya, with sorrow and hopes. I discovered that I missed that life in the land of fear. I wished I could go back. Farida came back to me. Caution and fear were my companions. I lived on, looking back fondly on the land of fear.
