[CHEERING] - SOLDIER: We did it! - Good luck, soldier. - When did you last see her? - Our wedding day, four years ago. Met her on Friday, married her on Sunday, left on Monday? - Pretty much. - Me too. Ain't war hell? - I bet we don't recognize them. - I'd recognize her anywhere. MAN [ON SPEAKER]: I find the pheasant to be quite pleasant. WOMAN: I find the pheasant to be quite pleasant. How do you find the wine? - I find the wine extraordinarily... - Betty? I prefer to dine at home, alone. Paul? Paul! When you weren't on the dock... I didn't know! Didn't you get my letters? I started to read them, I did. But after the first few... ...I couldn't bear to hear about the fighting and killing... - I wrote you almost every day. - I know, and I kept them. Look. See? Even the thought of you in all that danger, it was too much. I knew if I got them, you were alive. That's all I cared about. That you were alive. Safe. That's all that was important to me. Can you forgive me? Yeah. Sure. I wrote to you. Did you get those? I got a few. I told you I wasn't a big writer. I quite agree the distinction is dubious, don't you? It's a course I'm taking. Self-improvement. His name is Armisted. He makes tons of money. The whole country's making money. You've been away, you don't know. But you will. I saw Mr. Sweeney to make sure he held your job. You can start anytime! Just make sure you wear your uniform. Who could resist a war hero? Of course, I negotiated a raise. Betty, I don't want to go back to selling chocolate. You've got something better? No, I don't. But you know... ...in the war, I had time to think about what's important. About what I want out of life. For me. For us. - I wrote you all this. - Are we back to those letters again? You want me to read the letters? No. It's just you'd understand what I'm feeling, what I want. Sweetie... ...tell me what you want. - I thought some time... - Time's money. I want things, Paulie. My whole life I've been without. I want things. Don't you want... ...things? [BLUES MUSIC PLAYS] - You'll wear your uniform, right? - My uniform? To sell chocolates. Millions and millions of them. - Won't you? - Yes. Here, let me help. I'm sorry. - He's going to kill me. - It's just glass. You can replace it. - Sorry. - No, it's my fault. Look at this mess. Here you go. Are you all right? Ticket, please. Had an accident. Yes. Thanks. [WHISTLING] [SHOUTING] [MUSIC BOX PLAYS] At your speed, you could've made Sacramento before me. You smell anything? No. Oh, my God! I'm so embarrassed. I wanted to apologize, but you looked so peaceful. Apology accepted. Good book? - Quite a mouthful. - It's required reading. - College? - My master's degree. Playing hooky? No. Going home. My family has a vineyard in Napa. - And you? - Business in Sacramento. - The train goes to Sacramento. - My ticket didn't. - I mean, it did when I got on, but... - Oh, no! I think this is yours. Yep. I thought it was a mistake. I'm so sorry. Is this seat taken? How are you? Look, I'm Bill. This is my buddy Herman. And you're... Not interested. I had a girlfriend who always said she wasn't interested. - It was never what she meant. - Definitely not. - No. Not after she got to know me. - Stop it! - Fellas. - Come on, just give it a shot. She doesn't want to be bothered. Just let her be. LOUT 1: Now, what are we gonna do? LOUT 2: Shut up! I think he broke my nose! I gotta get to Sacramento. Not on this bus, you don't. [VICTORIA CRYING] We haven't been properly introduced. I'm Paul Sutton. Victoria Arag?n. I'm sorry about the bus. I feel terrible. All the problems I've caused you. You should go. Who knows what will happen next? There's always the possibility of a forest fire, I suppose. - Why aren't you on the bus? - My stop. - You're waiting for a ride? - No. No. A miracle. He's going to kill me. - Who? - My father. - If this is about the picture frame... - It's not about the picture. It's none of my business, but if you'd like to talk about it... "I was not meant for the conventions of this world. "I am a free spirit. " - Who's a free spirit? - My professor. He and I were... We were... Just because some free spirit broke up... I'm pregnant! You're very upset. I can understand that. Definitely understand that. But, Victoria, look at the positive side. It's a new life arriving. And that's a miracle. "I will kill anyone who dishonors my family. " How many times has he said that? A million? - It's just a figure of speech. - It's not! My father means what he says. Always. He's very old-fashioned. If I come home this way, without a husband, he'll kill me. I know he will. What if you do show up with a husband? Who does what? Comes for the day and then leaves? Sure. Meets the family. Stays one night, then leaves. - Writes a letter saying he's... - Abandoned me? Happens. You're very kind for trying to help me. Maybe it might work... But there's nobody. Miss Arag?n! Victoria. There's me. VICTORIA: Was it horrible? The fighting? PAUL: Once the shooting starts, you just go blank. You try to think of something else. What did you do? Write letters to my wife in my head. - Later, I would write them down. - About the war? About what I'd like our life to be like when I got home. The perfect little house, kids running in the yard with the dog... ...great job... She must've cherished every word. Yeah, every word. - You're very kind to do this for me. - And the baby. I'm doing it for you both. - Then we both thank you. - You're both welcome. We call it Las Nubes. It means "The Clouds. " It's beautiful. Yeah. Well... We're gonna do this right. The Wedding Bonbon Deluxe. A big seller around June. [GUNSHOT] We're unarmed. Don't shoot. - Hello, Papa. - Victoria? Who's this? Paul Sutton. My husband. - Marie! Marie! - It'll be okay. Like hell it'll be okay! I will not allow this! I'll go to the Pope to get this undone! We weren't married in a church. Marie! - Mama. - Victoria! Here's the problem. Is this how you were raised? To betray your mother and your father? - I did not betray anyone. - What are you talking about? What do you think I'm talking about? The gringo. His name is Paul, Papa. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] I told you. I told you. A girl's place is here. At home! Here! Not alone in some city... - ... doing God knows what. - I go to school there. - Will someone tell me what's going on? - Your daughter, she is married! VICTORIA: Grandpa, make him stop, please! ALBERTO: That's right. Coddle her. The whole bunch of you. But I tell you right now... ...this will not stand so long as I draw breath. I swear to God! - Alberto! - You are so unfair. Me? I'm unfair? I came home to tell my family that I spit on their trust? I'm the one who rubs in their face that I married... ...this... Well, what do you do? Chocolate. I sell chocolate. No? You. You are the head of the family. Say something. I am Pedro Arag?n. Welcome to our happy family. Thank you. - May I? - Sure. Of course. Help yourself. It's wonderful! It's wonderful. VICTORIA: Why can he never just say, "I'm happy for you. Congratulations"? - Why is everything a drama? - MARIE: It is a shock. Not for Grandma or Grandpa. Or you. Why is he always this way? - I hate him! - MARIE: He is your father. GUADELUPE: He has never taken change well. Even as a child. Only with the vines, he has patience. He should have some for us too for a change. You could have prepared us. A letter would've been wiser. - I wanted to surprise you. - You certainly succeeded. He wants me to marry a man in Mexico I've never met... ...just because of his "bloodlines. " I am not a horse. It's my choice who I marry. Not his. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] How many times have you said, "The heart wants what the heart wants"? And is this what your heart wants? Yes. Really and truly? Really and truly. It will be fine. You'll see. Everything will be perfect. What a delicate ring! You look beautiful tonight. Marriage becomes her, no? Dear God, bless this food we are about to eat. Bless the harvest of the grapes you've given us... ...in your wisdom and grace. Amen. - ALL: Amen. - Bon app?tit! This is pumpkin flower soup. My grandmother's specialty. It's delicious. ALBERTO: It was in the family... ...before your Declaration of Independence was signed. With all the commotion, we never heard the story of how you two met. - I was on leave in June... - July. - Just after I moved to the city. - That's right. July, at the USO. I didn't know you worked at the USO. I wasn't actually working there. Then what were you doing in a hall filled with strange men? Pedro. Oh, excuse me. My grandfather lived to 102. He used salt like the fish in the sea. My great-grandfather was 106! So tell us, Mr. Sutton... ...since we now have such a clear picture of how you two met... ...where are you from? Moline, Illinois. Wherever that is. It's exactly in the middle of the country, right? Right. And your parents? They are still in Moline? - I never knew my parents. - Oh. Who brought you up? The fairies? - I grew up in a home. - Whose home? I meant an orphanage. Wonderful. This is just wonderful. My daughter can trace her ancestors back 400 years... ...to some of the finest families in Mexico. And you are telling me she has married a man with no past? Or worse, a man with no past and no future. - Wonderful. - You don't know that he has no future. - You don't know anything about him. - Do you? Yes. I know he knows how to love somebody. I know he wants a house, with kids and a dog. - A great job. - You mean like the one he has? Excuse me. It was very good. Thank you. He doesn't pull any punches, does he? I'm sorry. You must think they're horrible. When I was a kid, every night I'd go to the orphanage roof... ...and make a wish on every star I could see. - That's a lot of wishing. - It usually boiled down to one wish. - What was it? - For what you have in there. Everyone telling you how to live your life? Better than having no one telling you. I don't know about that. I do. That's no reason for him to treat you that way. No. And I was going to say something... ...but I thought, "What if it were me?" My only daughter marries a strange man and I'm the last to know. - I'd probably act the same way. - No, you wouldn't. - I don't know about that. - I do. Well, it's only another eight hours... ...and I'll be back on the road. I think the worst part's over, don't you? This bed was part of my dowry when I married Mr. Arag?n. It was my grandmother's before that. Her dowry. She had it brought all the way from Paris. He was a diplomat, my grandfather. This is where we spent our first wedding nights. My mother... ...my grandmother... ...and me. - We can sleep in Pedro's room. - In that teeny, tiny, little bed? On your wedding night? You need room... ...to maneuver. Mommy. I know it's not your first night together... ...but I'd like to think it is. It's just that from the beginning... ...all our marriages have been so blessed. You know, it's out of love... ...that my husband roars so. We are very traditional people. This modern world takes a little getting used to. He'll come around. Love each other. Always. First he comes into my house, steals my daughter... ...and now he takes my bed? No! Can't you see your daughter is a woman? She was not "stolen" any more than you stole me. Or have you forgotten that room under the stairs in my father's house? I asked for your hand properly. With respect. Who is he? He is nobody! He is her choice. And she is our daughter. Alberto, it is from us that she's learned to be who she is. If we don't trust her, we can't trust ourselves. Say good night so they won't go to bed thinking you're furious. But I am! I am furious with them. You should smile more. You are so handsome when you smile. First, go and wish them good night. Come on. Go. Do you like selling chocolate? - No, not really. - Why are you doing it? It's part of why I took this trip. Try and figure things out for myself. - But you have things figured out. - It's not that easy. It's complicated. It doesn't sound that complicated. You're not married. I'm sorry. It's just not a good time for me now. You've been wonderful. More than wonderful. Would you turn around, please? There'll be someone for you, Victoria. - You don't have to make me feel better. - No. I believe that. I believe there's a someone for everyone. Someone who'll love you, no matter what. Would you marry someone if it wasn't your baby she was carrying? If I loved her. Good night. Good night. [KNOCKING] - ALBERTO: May I? - One moment, Papa. Your mother sent me to wish you good night. - Good night. - Good night, Mr. Arag?n. Good night. - Does the door have a lock? - No. - Do you think he suspects? - I don't know. Better not take the chance. In case he comes back, I should stay. Yes. Good night. Good night. [MUSIC BOX PLAYS] Victoria! Victoria! It's all right. It's all right. It was just a dream. It's nothing. It must be the change. Coming home. Everything so fast. What's the matter? Frost! DON PEDRO: What do you think? It hasn't reached the inside. We can still save them. We have a chance. Now! How can I help? - Can you fly? - If you show me. We're losing everything, and you want me to show you? Look. ALBERTO: Damn it, spread out. Spread out! Like a butterfly. If you're going to help, help! Butterfly. Get the heat down on the grapes. Follow me. Up. Down. Up. Down. That's it. Come on, with me. - The bus doesn't leave until 11 a. m. - Then it's daylight. Everyone will be up. It's better this way. Less questions. Yes. I wish you the best of luck. You too. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] The call of the grape robs our sleep. When she's ripe, she calls to a man. Give me that. Walk with me. Bring the chocolates. DON PEDRO: You know, everybody gives advice, how to grow them. And the doctors, they say, "Don Pedro, no chocolates. "Pedro, no salt. And no cigars. "And as little brandy as possible. " What the hell do the doctors know... ...about the needs of a man's soul? Nada! Nothing. May I? Oh, this one. This looks like my granddaughter's... I never noticed that. In 1580, the first Arag?n, also a Pedro, left Spain for Mexico... ...with a dream in his head, the clothes on his back... ...and a root from the family's vineyard inside his pocket. Excuse me. May I see one more? Which one? No, that's no good. One more. That's wonderful. Come. I will show you something. This is the root I brought with me. A descendant from the root... ...the first Pedro brought with him. All our vines come from this one. It's not just the root of Las Nubes. It's the root of our lives. Of Victoria's life. Now that you are a part of all this, a part of us... ...it is the root of your life. You are an orphan no longer. So you will stay with your family... ...while we harvest the fruit. It's a special time. It's a time of magic! I really can't. I have commitments. What about the commitments to your family? - What can be more important than that? - I would like to, really. But I can't. He said you would not stay. - Who did? - Alberto. He said, "The first chance that gringo gets... "... he will leave her. " - His exact words. - I'm not leaving her... No, I understand. It's just my poor granddaughter. He will whip her with it. She'll be the one to pay for your "commitments. " Such a pity. Such a sweet girl. - It's just the difference of a day. - Our most important day. The day that makes or breaks our fortunes. That's what he will throw up to her. For the rest of her life! I know... ...my son. Don Pedro. You're right. It's only one day. I'll stay. Right. May I? It's a good thing. You have no more chocolates to sell anyway. Come on. I thought you were leaving. It's better for you if I stay. At least until the harvest. Don't you have chocolates to sell? Family comes first. [HORN HONKS] MAN: Hey, everybody. I'm home! Hiya, sis! Hi, Jos?. Hi, Grandpa. Hi, Grandma. My favorite chili's ready? [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] - Hi, Mom. - At last! Hi, Pop. Sorry I'm late. This is my husband, Paul Sutton. Paul, my brother. You got hitched? Hey, that's swell! Victoria Sutton. I like that. - Welcome to the family. I'm Pete. - Thanks. Pete? Who is "Pete"? PEDRO: Pa, come on. ALBERTO: I don't know any Pete. I pay a fortune to Stanford University... ...for a Pedro Alberto Arag?n Limantour. Maybe I'm paying for the wrong person, and I should stop the check. - Glad to meet you, Pedro. - ALBERTO: Can we begin now? Victoria. Make sure he knows what to do. We don't want him cutting himself and getting blood on the grapes. It'll ruin the taste of the wine. Aren't you happy you stayed? PEDRO: Papa. Salute. Come on! [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] - How do they feel? - They're a little big. Like family, you must live in clothes for a while before they fit. But you are doing great. Not everyone would agree. DON PEDRO: It's not easy being in charge. It wasn't for me. It's not easy for him. Every man must find his own way. But I have faith in my son. And I have faith in you. But your fly is open. My wife's family, the Aztecs... ...believe that you must have permission... ...of the four winds to harvest what the earth gives. Isn't she beautiful? Come on, you're a married woman now! What about Pedro? - He's not married. - Neither are we. [SINGING IN SPANISH] I want you more than anything. You can't imagine how I want you. But I'm not free. I won't hurt you that way. I won't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - We can lead the market, not chase it. - Where's my hat? PEDRO: Raise money through limited partnerships. - Hi, Paul. - Hi, Pedro. Good morning, Mr. Arag?n. - So, what do you think, Pop? - About what? Modernizing the operation, limited partnerships? - A partner equals trouble. - You can always borrow from the bank. Listen, just because you harvested a few grapes doesn't give you a say. Stick to your candy and keep your nose out of our business. Now, tell me what's going on here. That you sleep one night on the floor, the next on the couch? You'll use any excuse to make him feel unwelcome, won't you? There's something wrong here. This whole thing smells wrong. A girl comes home with a husband nobody ever heard of... ...with her suitcase as full as when she went away. Like she has no place else to go. Where's my hat? You don't want me here? I'll leave. - Is that what you want? - I want the truth. - That's what I want. - No, you don't. The truth you want is the truth according to you. That's the only truth you accept. Try me. The truth is, she came home because she loves her family. I told you, stay out of our business. She is my business. You were looking for this? Se?ora! Se?ora! Thank you, but I don't have time. It smells! I have to leave. I have business. Don Pedro has finished your business, no? And besides, you must see it through. - See what through? - Your fate. What brought you here. Nothing brought me here. I brought me here. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Let me help you. - No, we had a plan. You were to stay one night and go back to your wife. - Stick to the plan. - I can't leave you like this. And tomorrow? Will you stay tomorrow too? And the day after that? Go home, Paul. You still have a wife. - Here. Leave it at the station. - Please. You can't help me anymore! No one can help me. It's not your problem. It's not my problem. I can't leave. I can't. Victoria! Victoria? Victoria? Don't think just because you married her... ...any of this is yours. If you married her at all. - What do you mean? - I wasn't there. I didn't see a wedding, or even a wedding certificate. And don't think that just because I speak with an accent... ...I think with an accent. For four years that I've been at war... ...I had to keep myself closed off. - What's your reason? - What are you talking about? - Reason for what? - Shutting your daughter out of your heart. Can't you see how amazing she is? How alive? I dream of getting the kind of love she tries to give you. I would die for what you have. Why can't you just love her? She's so easy to love. You know nothing about my daughter! You hear me? Nothing! I know that she is good and strong... ...and deserves all the love this world has to give. Can't you see? How wonderful, how special she is? You see this? This land? This vineyard? This is 365 days a year. Who do you think I do this for? For them. All of them! I love my family! You should let them know. Paul? Hey, Paul. Brandy! The finest. I made it myself... ...21 years ago. The secret about brandy is age. The secret of everything... ...is age. Hija, are you all right? He only went to work. He will come back. What the hell is that? My uniform. Of course. Newlyweds! What else do they do but make love and war? - Did you talk to her? - I tried. Wouldn't make a difference. Talking between men and women... ...never solves anything. Where we think... ...they feel. They are creatures of the heart. Please, sit down. - Don Pedro... - No, no. Please, come on. Give me that. - I'll miss my bus again. - Make yourself comfortable. Tomorrow we go to the festival for the wine blessing. The bus will be there. I have the perfect solution for you. Salute. Salute. [SINGING] If you call me, my love Allow me to call you beloved I will cherish you Forever Thank you. Isn't that the most romantic thing you ever heard? - Maybe it loses a bit on translation. - No, no. - No, no, no. - All right, now. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Now you sing. [SINGS OFF-KEY IN SPANISH] It's all right. You did wonderful. Let's let the experts do it themselves. DON PEDRO: You're a gringo. Nice, but still a gringo. The heart you are talking to is Mexican. You speak to it in the language it understands. You... You be strong. You stand right here. Right here. No, no. You've had enough. All right. You boys, wait for my signal. [SINGING IN SPANISH] Alberto... Alberto... Listen. You watch her window. When the light comes on... ...you are saved! Just watch the window. He seems to love her. Maybe... ...I've been too tough on him. What's the matter? MAN: Don't have too much fun. - Our bus leaves in 10 minutes. - PAUL: Thanks. [YODELING] The Arag?ns! The Arag?ns are coming! Hello, how are you? - Mar?e Jos?. - Padre. I will now recite the Blessing of the Harvest. We thank you, Lord, for bestowing on us the bounty of thy harvest. We ask that each life here be blessed with the full measure of love... ...health and happiness... ...that those who acknowledge God justly deserve. Amen. ALL: Amen. Excellent! Victoria. Your serenade was very beautiful. Will you toast with me? What do we toast to? To "what if. " To "what if. " Father Filipo... ...may I introduce Paul Sutton, my new son-in-law. As you can see, a bona fide war hero. - He helped bring in the harvest. - Papa. What? I can't be proud? - A blessed surprise. Congratulations! - Thank you, Father. I gave her First Communion. Thought I'd give her in marriage. And you shall. City hall is not a proper place to take your wedding vows. Not for my only daughter. Tonight... Listen to me! Tonight, I give my daughter's hand in marriage... ...before the eyes of God. And I will take it as a personal insult... ...if you all do not show up. You are all invited! - Why are you doing this? - A man can change his mind, can't he? - We have to tell them. - No. I have to tell them. I'm not scared now. Here. For the baby. A little present. - What did you get it for? - Courage under fire. Paul Sutton... ...you are the most honorable man I have ever known. - Where to, soldier? - San Francisco. I can get you as far as San Rafael. Climb in. Thanks. - What you doing around here? - Walking. Walking? In the clouds. Welcome back to earth. [MUSIC BOX PLAYS] - BETTY: Who's there? - It's me. - You read them. - Yes, Paul... MAN: Betty? Listen, it wasn't gonna work, for either of us. Had I read the letters sooner... We hardly knew each other. We want different things. MAN: Who is it, Betty? I don't even like dogs! It's not what it appears to be. - Armisted? - Paul, listen to me. It would have never worked for me. - I'd be miserable! - I came back... - You have a gun? - I was ready. - Don't do anything crazy. - I'll leave. Don't hit me! I'm not gonna hit you. Betty... We could still be friends. Friends? I thought an annulment would be easiest. You just have to sign it. I'm sorry, Paul. Paul, are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine! [PAUL LAUGHS] Mr. Arag?n? Mr. Arag?n. I owe you an apology, sir. - What I did was wrong. - Get off my land! My intentions were to protect her. - Stay away from her. - I can't. She's like the air to me. I'm asking you for her hand in marriage. You are already married, you son of a bitch! - My gun! - JOS?: Don Alberto? My gun! Now! My marriage wasn't meant to be. It was a mistake. But it's over. - Annulled. - You deceived me! In my own house! In my own bed! Stay away from her! I want to be with her forever and take care of her. - Jos?, my gun! - Victoria! Paul? You made me a fool to everyone. - It's not your child she carries! - It will be if she'll have me. I'll see you dead first! Paul! - Victoria! - Paul! Victoria! Stop! I love him! I love him! My God! Papa! What have I done? Drunk! Please! Let me go! Get away! I want to die. Get away! Lie down, Pedro! Don't run! Lie down! PEDRO: I'm all right! Papa? I was afraid. I was afraid of losing you. All of you. I didn't know any other way to love. Can you teach me? Please, can you teach me? The fire burned through... ...everything. There's no root stock left... ...to replant. Las Nubes... ...is finished. Has it reached the inside? It's alive. It's alive. Las Nubes lives! MAN: We can plant! This... ...is the root... ...of your life. The root of your family. You are bound to this land... ...and to this family... ...by commitment... ...by honor... ...and by love. Plant it. It will grow. I don't know how. Victoria... ...help your husband. It's beautiful!
