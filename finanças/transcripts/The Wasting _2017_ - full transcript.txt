Sophie's mother is dead. What? She's dead. For two years. No, she isn't. She went dancing with her friends, she drink too much, they find her in the lake. But Sophie talks... - I know. - Like she's alive. I thought she stopped. He brought her back here for a fresh start. Valerie is still alive to her. She won't let her go. VALERIE: My little girl. SOPHIE: Liam turned into a monster. I think he's the monster that's trying to kill me. I didn't tell you, I didn't want to scare you. It's time to be happy now.
