Yeah! All right! Let her go! It floats. Not bad, huh? Wow! It's fantastic! Can I get on? Hey, you paid for it. I'm the one who has to ask permission to board. Go ahead. Here you go. Here you go, Frank. No, no, no, no. I'll take one of these. All right. To Frank Morrison, for building us... The most beautiful boat in the water. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that boat was the bargain of the century. Well, I made a price, kept the price. and if you build any more at that price, you'll go out of business. You know, Theresa, I should explain to you my theory of noble failure. but Danny's got a game. See ya. Hey. Hey, Frank. So, uh, how come your boyfriend's not coming with you? Danny said that he wouldn't play if he saw Rick in the stands. He's really got it in for the guy, doesn't he? Coach. coach! How are ya? Hey, Frank. How's it going? Where's Dan? He isn't here. Why not? I asked him to stay, but he chose to leave. I don't know where he went. Coach, let's go! Yeah, this is Frank Morrison. Oh, really? What? Is that Danny? What? Okay. okay, we'll be there. He's at the police station. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Danny. - Mom, dad. I can't believe you would stow away in some complete stranger's car. Where did you think you were going? Nowhere. anywhere. What difference does it make? What are you thinking? Look, what's the big deal? All right, I'm sorry. Okay? I just didn't feel like playing today, so I booked. Mr. and Mrs. Morrison. please come in. Wait here. The first time we picked him up, it was for breaking windows. Danny insisted that we had the wrong kid. yes, and he wanted to hire a lawyer. We remember. It was two years ago, right after you guys separated. Six months later, we got him in here for truancy. That was right after... right after we got our divorce, yes. all this acting out is just Danny's way of... Of trying to get us back together. We've logged a lot of hours, a lot of counselors. Clearly, it hasn't done us any good. Any idea what set him off this time? yes, I'm sure that it's because I'm getting remarried. - Oh, boy. Who's the lucky guy? - Rick Barnes. - I know Rick. - Of course you do. Everybody does. Congratulations, then. Well, they do, honey. your mom's gettin' married. I know you don't like it. I get it. but you're not gonna use it as an excuse to get wild. You're not gonna do it. Okay, dad. No, I'm not kidding, Danny. Your mother's got a right to move on with her life. I think you ought to give this guy a break. What do you think? Dad, do you ever wish that things could be, you know, like they were? Well, Danny, maybe you don't remember, but, uh, things weren't all that great. I remember you were home every day. Yeah, I know, but, uh, The truth is, your mother and I tried hard to make it work out, But we were arguing all the time. And Frankly, I didn't think I was doing you any favors by sticking around. Hey, guess what? The mast is up on the big boat. so we're still going sailing saturday? Yeah. You bet. Great. great. all right, see you saturday. Yeah, saturday. Hey, Frank, will you hold on for a second? I'm sorry, mom. Okay? it's okay, sweetheart. I love you. I love you too. Bye, dad. all right, so he, um... he said that he'd give Rick a break. at least it's something. Yeah, cool. Thank you. You're welcome. um, you're still taking him sailing on saturday, right? - oh, yeah. why? - um... Well, you know, Danny takes his cues from you, and I thought that maybe if you asked Rick to go sailing with you guys, it might... jesus, Susan. I mean, come on. Giving him a pep talk is one thing, but taking your fiance sailing with us? - come on. jeez! - I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked. Damn it! You okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Susan asked me to take Rick sailing with us this weekend... So Danny and he can bond. Maybe it's a good idea. What? Well, Danny needs to accept the fact that his mom's getting remarried. and you're gonna have to accept it too, Frank. I-i can accept it. I have no problem accepting it. I don't wanna hang out with the guy, that's all. so what really bothers you about sailing with Rick? are you afraid that Danny might get to like him? maybe I don't want him bonding with him. maybe I don't want him to have a new dad. Remember my friend? His ex-wife ran away with-with keith barrel, the football player. Well, his kid admired the guy so much that he-he took his name, and then eventually stopped seeing his real dad altogether. Oh, come on, Frank. Danny loves you. You're his dad. Diane, these things happen. And Rick Barnes... jesus, ever since he got in town, everyone's just falling all over him just 'cause he's loaded. He's got more than just money, Frank. Yeah? what? According to everyone, he's a very nice guy. Well, I'm a nice guy too, supposedly, but no one's falling all over me. Yes, you are. I'm just a boat builder. A poor boat builder at that. all right, it's just like a car, okay? you turn left to go left and right to go... port. No, that's left. And that's starboard. Right, right, right, right. I know what you mean. I'm saying, maybe we should stick to lefts and rights. That way. That I understand. I'm impressed, Danny. You know a lot about boats, man. Well, you know, my dad and I, we spend a lot of time out here. I can see why. It's beautiful. Thanks for including me today. I'm having fun. Yeah, no problem. there's so many beautiful places in the world. How'd you end up here? I invested in this pharmaceutical company, And they came out with this new blood pressure medicine. Mm-hmm. The stock just went through the roof. It was like winning the lottery, but... You know, it gave me a chance to do something different with my life. Yeah. You know, Frank, I'd never try to take your place with him. I just want a shot at being his friend. Well, I'll tell you what. There's two things you gotta remember with a kid. Number one: You gotta show him that you love him. Number two: give him stuff. You mean bribe him, right? Well, you know, if you bought him a new baseball glove, You'd be right in with him. Sounds like a plan. Danny! ready about! Pull it in. There you go. There you go. - see ya, Rick. - yeah, I'll see you later, Dan. Frank, do you know the Seacliff Resort at buzzard's bay? Oh, yeah. The dump? Sure. what about it? Actually, I just bought it. Oh. It's beautiful. Yeah. Well, the idea is to try to turn it into something beautiful. Uh-huh. How would you feel about building me some boats? Oh, we're so busy lately, I? Come on, Frank. You'd really be doing me a favor with it. Well, I'll think about it. So, um, are you maybe feeling a little bit better... About your mom marrying Rick, or what? I guess, yeah. Good. - But I'm still not going to the wedding. - Why is that? it'd just be too weird watching mom get married. Well, you gotta go, because you're gonna break your mother's heart if you don't. You going? No. but that's different. I... you know. We were married, and it's just... it's different. See? It's too weird for you too. You're right. You're right. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll go if you go. Deal? Deal. Good. we'll make fun of 'em together. Yeah. Wow. Susan sure did hit the Jackpot. I'm kidding, Frank. Hey, dad. hey. How you doing? Hey, you. You are just so handsome. Thank you. uh, I'm doing great, I guess. wait. I gotta show you what Rick got me. I'll be right back. Dad! It's a cal ripken. Oh, wow, a cal. That's great. Everyone take their seat. The ceremony's about to begin. Danny, time to get ready. Hey, folks, look over here. Rick has already proven himself to be a generous friend... To the church and to our entire community. so, Susan, do you take Rick to be your lawfully wedded husband, for richer, for poorer, In sickness and in health, till death do you part? I do. Rick, do you take Susan... To be your lawfully wedded wife, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do you part? Rick? I do. I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Hey, trouper. I'm proud of you. Hi. I'm a friend of Rick's. Appreciate you coming. Ray. congratulations. Thank you. Hi. Long time no see. Yeah, Ray, we got a lot of catching up to do. I can't wait. Thanks for dressing up. You look beautiful. Thank you. Thanks for coming, Frank. It means a lot. - Congratulations. It means the world to both of us, Frank. I'm glad you came. Thanks. Hey, who's your buddy? He's an old business acquaintance. I'm surprised he even showed up. I know. You look surprised. What do you mean? Well, you just look surprised. Hi. diet coke and a champagne to go. How are ya? You're a friend of Rick's, right? That's right. Frank Morrison. Ray Coleman. Nice wedding, huh? Yeah. I'll tell you one thing. She must know some pretty good tricks to make old Rick finally settle down. that's my ex-wife, Susan. Your ex? You're kidding me. Yeah. No. So, where are you from? Bay area, California. Wow. Came all the way out here for the wedding, huh? Well, I had some business in D.C. Oh. So, how long you known Rick? We go way back. Went to school together. Really? What about it? Oh, nothing. He just... He told me that you were in business together or something. Yeah. excuse me, Frank. Catch you later. You know, it really is too bad. What's that, Ray? You're registered. I saw the gift table. Registered at crate and barrel. Wow. Dishes, tablecloths, soup tureens. Did you register for a soup tureen? That's what I would have got you, if I'd been invited earlier. In fact, I could've been your best man. I appreciate we got some things to discuss here, Ray, but now's not a good time. You're busy? I'm gonna put you up in a motel for a while, outside of town, and I'll get in touch with you in a couple days. Why can't I stay here? You've got plenty of room. That's not a good idea, Ray. You know, I'm very lucky, Danny. I've been fortunate to have three great men in my life. Who's number one? You are, sweetheart. You'll always be number one. I'll see you guys later. - Where are you goin'? - I got some shopping to do. all right, well, have fun. Bye! Come on, Rick. Throw the ball. See you later, sweetheart. Good catch. Whoa! Come on. You could've had that. - I should've had that? - yeah. You should've had that. My glove, it's not broken in all the way. Glove's not broken in yet. All right. - Is your arm not broken in yet? - That was practically right to you, Rick. That was practically right to me? - My dad would've had that. - Who's your dad, Shaquille o'neal? He used to be captain of his baseball team. He's great at all sports. You know, your dad's gonna be working for me now. I hired him to build me some boats. Did he tell you that? No, he didn't. If your dad's such a great baseball player, How come he never taught you how to throw a baseball? I can throw the ball. then why are you putting the ball everywhere where I'm not? When you throw a baseball, you point your foot to somebody so the ball goes to him. - Just throw the ball. - I'm gonna throw the ball. but I don't wanna run for the ball, I don't wanna jump for the ball. I want the ball to come to me. Aim and concentrate. Come on. Turn it. Turn it! Take it easy! I am taking it easy, Danny. How the hell are you supposed to learn anything out here? Come on, turn the ball loose. You throw like shit. Let's go. You know, Rick, I don't wanna play anymore. Suit yourself. Bring the gloves in when you're done. Don't ask me to play again if you're gonna be a brat. See, you want about a half inch up. Mm-hmm. Just trim it off like that. All your strokes are even and forward, like so. All right? Mm-hmm. You can use the other side of the brush as well. This is the important part. Make sure that the edges don't dry, because then you'll get distortion. Mm-hmm. No open spots. Ready to try it? - What if I mess up? - Well, you know, that's a very interesting question. That's what I asked my dad, and that's what he asked his father. So do you know what your great-grandfather told your grandfather, Who told your father, who's telling you now? What? That's why god invented sandpaper. So this is okay? yeah, that's very good. so, uh, what happened with that whole window thing? I told mom it was an accident. Yeah, well, tell me it was an accident. I just got mad, okay? Mm-hmm. Why? because he had a problem with the way you threw a ball? No, he threw it hard, and he tried to hurt me. Oh, come on, Danny. Was it any harder than a line drive coming at ya? No. Then maybe he was just trying to prepare you for a real game or something. Why do you have to work for him anyway? Tell him you don't want his money. Tell him you don't need anything from him. I can't do that. Why not? because the truth is, Dan, that... I love making these wooden boats, but people don't want 'em anymore. When your grandpa made 'em, they'd line up from here to maine... just to have one. But they want plastic now. It's cheaper. They can afford it. You understand? Yeah. Yeah. Hey, you know, I was in the doughnut shop this morning. You know who I saw? Who? You know that girl Katie that you like? What's her last name? Yeah. - Lewis? She was there with her girlfriend, and she said... She was talking about you. She said, "he's nice" or "cute" or something like that. Well, since she got her braces off, she's a total babe. I know. And then she said that... she thought that your dad was a fox. Here you go, Frank. Have a nice day. Thank you. You too. How's it goin'? Frank Morrison. Hmm? I met you at Rick's wedding. Oh, jesus. Of course. yeah. Yeah. Ray, right? Yeah. Hey, do you wanna sit down? Sure. Sorry, Frank. I'm getting really bad with faces. It must be early alzheimer's or something. it's been a while since the wedding, so I wouldn't worry about it. I was surprised you're still here. You said something about just being in for the day, so... Yeah, I decided to stick around, grab myself a little R&R. Ah. Yeah. Now that I've been here for a while, I can see why Rick really fell in love with the place. Yeah, right. I'm thinking about looking at some real estate myself. Oh, no kidding? I kid you not. Well, if you're serious about it, I know a realtor. Sam Jones. He'll hook you up. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Do you know what I'm noticing? I haven't seen any adult book stores in this town. No kiddin'? I kid you not. Hey, just the man I wanted to see. There he is. And I owe you a call. Good to see you. Well, you're a busy man. if you weren't so busy, you wouldn't be getting Southport's man of the year award. Yeah, well, it's a slow year. We all know that, right? How's the, uh... how's the backhand coming? Coming along. - Wanna play tomorrow? - Let me give you a call. You take care. All righty. - Okay. Give my best to everybody. I will. Open up, Ray. What the hell were you doing in town this morning? - How'd you know I was in town? - What are you doing with my wife's ex, Ray? I was havin' eggs. Hey, why'd she leave him? He was great. I told him I was thinking about buying some property here, And he offered to find me a realtor. Maybe you and me could be neighbors. I had a good reason for wanting you to stay out of town, Ray. You talk too much. You always have. Yeah, well, maybe I'm not the only one. How do you think I found you? You know, when we were on the inside doing our little stretch, We'd all take our best shots at imagining where you'd run off to... To spend our money. You're lucky it was only me who figured it out, Or you would've had all three of us for wedding guests. What about tommy and john? What about them? What, are you gonna send 'em their share? So, don't you wanna know how I found you? Yeah. Of course I do, Ray. I remember this one time you were drunk... and telling me how crappy your childhood was, except for this one summer you spent on the maryland coast, where there was clean air and friendly people, blah, blah, blah. Hey, I ain't sayin' you were easy to find. I mean, I only had a general idea where to look. And I gotta tell ya, a lot of times I came this close... to just giving it up. but then... then you made the papers. You know, I'll tell you something, Ray. You know what I came to hate most about working outside the law? Having to associate with scumbags. You found yourself a lawyer to get yourself off. Maybe that makes you smarter than me. Doesn't make you better. I'll call you, Ray. I'm sick of you stalling me, Jack! I told you, Ray. It takes time to put this kind of money together. - Name's Rick. - it's funny how quick you can forget a name, Rick. Stay out of town, Ray. You don't belong there. Well? Well, I was right. doctor said I'm pregnant. I'm so happy. That's so great. Oh, Susan. I bet you it's gonna be a boy too. Wanna bet me on that? What's wrong, honey? Nothing. nothing. I just... I just didn't expect it to happen so soon, that's all. Honey, you know how much I wanted to have a baby. I'm happy. I know you do. I do too. I promise. You're just worried about Danny, huh? yeah, just first the marriage, and then the baby. It's a lot to handle, you know, for a kid. Danny... Danny, don't. Sweetie, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I did not mean for you to find out this way. - Leave me alone, mom. - Danny, can't you at least try being happy for everybody? - No! Danny, please don't... Susan, please don't let him ruin this. This is the happiest day of my life. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just give me two minutes. Just two minutes, okay? I'll be right down. Diane, it's me. Is my dad there? I have to talk to him. No, honey, he's not home yet. Danny, can I come in? When's he coming home? Soon, I guess. Danny, are you okay? Tell him he's gotta come and get me, all right? I have to talk to him. Who are you talking to? Take me to my dad's house. I wanna go now. No. you know what? This is between us. You and I are gonna sit down here and we're gonna talk this through. Okay? I know that you're upset, sweetheart. But believe me, a baby is not gonna change the way I feel about you. I know, mom. I'm number one, remember? Check out of your room. meet me out front at 7:00. did you get it all? Yeah, Ray, I've got it all. All right, I'll be waitin'. it's about time. Twenty-five-footer by Adler no good! And it's out of bounds. What did I miss? Excuse me, guys. I gotta go into town for a little while, but it shouldn't take long. okay, um, just... Um, I'll walk you to your car, okay? All right. We are not through. I'll be right back. - How do you feel the conversation's going? - I don't understand. I feel like I've betRayed him or something. Stop it, will ya. You haven't betRayed anybody. He's just upset. He'll get over it. I'll wrap this thing up, then I'll be home. I love you. I love you. Please drive carefully. It looks like there's a storm coming in. It's been a pleasure having you, Mr. Coleman. You come back any time. All right. See you around. Take care. Come on. Put it in the back. Good-bye and good riddance. So, where are you off to? Miami Beach. Yeah? - Starting tomorrow, I'm gonna be working on my tan and a case of Cuervo. If you ever get fed up here in Frontierland, come on down. Well, Niami's got no appeal for me. No? Yeah, none whatsoever. - I'm gonna have a kid. - Get the hell out of here. Yeah, Susan just told me. Isn't that great? Man, you're really going all the way with this leave it to beaver thing, huh? - Two kids? - Danny's not mine. Man, that's gotta be tough putting up with some other guy's brat. - I couldn't do it. - I put up with his damn kid because I got no choice. Let's see. All right. I gotta make a stop here. - Why? Well, you don't think I had that kind of cash on me, did you? I got it stashed up here at a brickworks I own. Comes in handy for stuff. Jesus! What? No, no, it's... I've just never been out here before at night, And I can't see a goddamn thing 'cause it's pourin' down. Jeez. Are you kiddin' me? No, I'm not kiddin' you. Can you see anything in this shit? Jesus! what, are... what, are you lost? Relax. It's around here somewhere. Let me just look at the map, all right? Jesus. The map's in here. It's gotta be here somewhere. Come on. I got a flight to catch. Will you stop bitching at me? look in the back for the map. Jesus christ. I don't see no goddamn map. Well, it's in here somewhere. You see it? This is unbelievable. Wait till you see what you got back here. - What's going on? - it's Danny, Rick. He ran away. Are you okay? I'm fine. It's okay, Mr. Barnes. Your wife got a call from Mr. Morrison. Danny showed up over there. Thank god. You wanna go get him? Hold on, Mr. Barnes. There's more. - What is it? - He told his father he saw you kill a man. He told his father what? He claims he was hiding in the back of your suburban. He says that's where he saw you do it. Susan, what would make Danny say something like this? it's obvious, Rick. It's Danny's way of getting back at us for the baby. Well, we should head on down to the station. and we'll be needing the keys to your suburban. Look, I know what I saw, okay? I'm not makin' this up. He killed a guy. Danny, are you sure you're not doing this because you're mad at Rick? Diane, please. Danny, let's go over this again, all right? All right. Take your time. start from the beginning. don't leave anything out. Yeah. It's okay. Send 'em in. it's your mother and stepfather. They're gonna join us. No. dad, please. No, I don't wanna see him, dad. Danny. Look, I already told you. He never said his name. Dad. - Just answer the question. It's okay. And you say that you heard your stepfather and this man talking about money. They were supposed to be going to get some money, only Rick killed him instead. Danny, stop this, please. He said that he loved the baby and that he hated me. sweetheart, listen, I know that we've hurt you, but what you're doing isn't fair, it's not right. I'm telling the truth. No, Danny, you're doing what you do... When a situation comes along that you can't handle. - Look, he knows the truth. He knows what he did. - Danny... and you're just gonna sit there and let him get away with it. - Dad... Come in. Johnson just called in from the brickworks. Excuse me. So, no charbroiled skeletons? If a body was incinerated in a kiln like they got over there, It would take a forensic specialist... I am not wasting any more time or money on this sick kid's bullshit story. Stevens, phone call. Line seven. Hold on. Stevens. It's the garage. Yeah, go on. There was, uh, no visible evidence at all at the bRickworks... Or, for that matter, in your truck. Keys are at the front desk. You all should go home. - It's all right. We'll all three sit down and have a talk. Do whatever you wanna do or what you think is right, sweetheart. You know that. Danny, come on. Let's go home. I'm not going home with him. I'll wait outside in the car. Danny, we are gonna go home and talk about this, okay? Dad, please don't make me go home. Susan. Susan, let's... Let him come home with me. Every time he has a problem, he comes running to you. I want him to come home now. - No. dad, don't make me go. - Oh, Jesus, Danny. - Knock it off. Dad, you don't believe me either? You're asleep right now. This is a dream. You're dreaming that someone's got their hand over your mouth, and it's hard to breathe. And you can't wake up, can you? Can you? Now, you had a dream about a murder, And it felt like it was real. It was only a nightmare. You don't want every moment of your life to be a big screaming nightmare, Do you, Danny? You better wake up. He wants me to pick 'em up? Mm-hmm. Have the port lights come in? I'm expecting them this afternoon. All right, well, call to make sure. Hey, how you doing? Good morning. How are you, Frank? Got a hell of a place here. - Rick. Frank, I just wanna let you know... I'm not taking what happened last night personally. I just look forward to gettin' past it. But on to something more positive here, I do have the start-up money for the Seacliff... $50,000. When do you think you could start building the boats? You know, when I went home last night, I couldn't even think about sleeping. But here's what I did think about. my son is living with you in your house, And I have absolutely no idea... of what kind of man you really are. and honestly, that scares the hell out of me. Well, Frank, you're a good dad, you know. but before you start lettin'... Your imagination run away with you here, I'd ask you to remember something. it's true that you may not know me so well, But you do know Danny. Yeah. and he lies. I know that. He lies to his mother and his grandmother, Teachers, the police. Well, just about everybody, but... but what? He doesn't lie to me. hard as I tried, I couldn't think of a single time. I didn't kill anybody, Frank. - You know, probably not, Rick. - I'm glad to hear you say that. As long as my son is living with you under your roof, "probably" isn't good enough. Jesus christ, Frank, this... Who is this guy Ray? W-what about him? He's your school chum? He's your business acquaintance? Uh, the other day I saw him. He was lookin' for real estate. Ray? Yeah. So now it's Ray I supposedly killed. Is that right? I tell ya, Frank, Trying to be a stepfather to a child that hates your guts... Isn't exactly a picnic. I thought you were on my side for this. I'm on Danny's side. Well, give my best to Diane then, Frank. Right. I just think it's a good idea if he stays with me. I'm not having this conversation. I know Rick threatens you, but this is ridiculous. Oh, he threatens me, all right. - You're so wrong about him. - You don't even know what he's really about. You're the one I don't really know anything about anymore, Frank. Do you think I so desperately need a man that I'm gonna endanger my own child by... Danny. What are you doing here? Come on, let's go. No, no, no. - He's coming home with me. He's scared of the guy. It's not right. - Okay, I get it. - What do you get? - Have I ever stopped you from seeing him? This is not about custody. Danny, please, get in the car. You wanna fight me for custody? I don't wanna fight youfor custody. please don't do this. Screw custody. - Hold on a second, Frank. - this is none of your business. - What if I make it my business? - Don't! Frank, don't do this! pl... I'm sorry, mike. Dad. Dad, that was so cool! Put your seat belt on. Honestly, dad, that was awesome. Knock it off, Danny. You know what I've just done? It's called kidnapping. - How could it be kidnapping? I'm your kid. - It just is. It doesn't matter. - So you believe me now? - Yeah. yeah. Dad, what are we gonna do now? I don't know. - Dad, watch out! - shit. You know, you never struck me... As the kind of guy who would exploit the emotional problems of his son... to make a play for custody. sergeant, I know you've got a history with my son. That's why you're having a hard time with this. but this character Ray Coleman, he was at the wedding... When Ray Coleman showed up at the wedding, Rick Barnes wasn't happy to see him. - Yeah, but there's more... - They had two different stories about how they met. So what? Maybe Ray Coleman is a little confused. - But he wasn't confused. - Maybe he'd been drinking. Come on now. You can go now, Mr. Morrison. Your ex-wife isn't pressing charges. And for the time being, neither are we. Oh, by the way, I checked with the police in the bay area. No Ray Coleman was reported missing. That's not good enough. Good-bye, Mr. Morrison. Jack... It was not my intention to fight for custody, but now I have no choice. Right. Okay. all right. I'll see you there at 10:00. Thanks. That was Berman. He's... He's tough, man. But he's good. He's the one who handled the whole divorce thing. We just have to figure out... What? I'm sorry, Frank, I just... I can't believe that you have managed to convince yourself that this man... "this man." This man who only wanted to help you... "this man"? Do you want me to ignore the fact that my son is living with a killer? This fantasy of yours sure does give you a good excuse, doesn't it? For what? Just forget it. - No. Excuse for what? - An excuse to hold on to your old life. I know Danny's your son. I would never ask you to choose between us. But I won't hang around while you take Susan on in some insane custody battle. Diane, I have never failed Danny, ever, And I can't fail him now, not when it counts. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too, Frank, But I can't do this. Rick, sweetheart, will you please hurry up? I don't wanna be late for this. Calm down, will ya? Moms always win these things, right? No, it's never a sure thing. You all right? I still can't believe this is happening. You know, Susan, uh, ever since Frank hit us with this custody thing, there's something I'd like to talk to you about. yeah? what? I feel like I've done everything I can but stand on my head where Danny's concerned, And he won't give me a break. I know. There's no way to... I know, and I'm sorry. There's nothing for you to be sorry about. it's been hard on everybody, but... maybe if Danny went off to live with Frank for a little while, maybe that wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for everybody. What? - I?m just trying to think about what would be best for everyone, dear. Rick... Susan. Things get really tense when Danny's around, And the doctor said if you get stressed out you could lose the baby. I don't give a damn what the doctor said. Danny's my son. Susan... it's bad enough he hardly talks to me anymore. If he goes to live with Frank, I'd be lucky if I ever see him again. We talked about this. Okay. I'm sorry. Danny's not gonna go anywhere. I promise you that. okay? Okay. Dan, listen up. Whatever the judge decides, I want you to know that your mother loves you. Remember that. All right. - I'll see you there. - all right. Love you. Bye-bye. Love you too. bye. I'm ready to go. Mom? She's bringing the car around. She can't hear you. Look, I'm not afraid of you. I don't give a damn. What I wanna know is, do I need to be afraid of you, Danny? What do you mean? This custody hearing thing that you have us all going to today, if we come home without you, Dan, That's gonna upset your mom. And like I said to you, I can't allow that to happen. Now, I know that you love your dad very much. How would you feel if something happened to him, huh? I'll do whatever you want. just please leave him alone. I want both parties to know... that a child of Danny's age is old enough to have a voice... in determining which parent he would be better off living with. Now, that being said, call your witness, Mr. Berman. Thank you, your honor. We'd like to call Danny Morrison to the stand. Hello, Danny. Danny Morrison? Yes, sir. How old are you? I'm 12, sir. Twelve. So we can't swear you in. but it is your word of honor when you sit in that witness box. Do you understand that? Yes, sir. Good. Then let's get to work. Counselor. Thank you, your honor. Hello, Danny. I'm gonna ask you a few questions. You all right with that? Mm-hmm. All right, let's go back to the evening of October 18, the night your mother came home from the doctor with some news. All right, well, just tell us what happened. I found out that my mom was gonna have a baby. Yeah? How did you handle that? I guess I kinda freaked. Go on. After that, I wanted to go and see my dad. - How come? - I felt like I needed to talk things over with him. - you and your dad are pretty close then, huh? - yes, sir. All right, Danny, uh, just take your time and tell us what happened next. I hid in the back of Rick's truck because he was going into town, And that's near where my dad lives. And then, uh, i... and then he stopped at this office building, and I jumped out. What? I ran to my dad's house and made up this story about seeing him kill some guy. - Danny, what are you doing? - Mr. Morrison. - Danny, tell him the truth. - Look, this is the truth, dad. - Did he threaten you? - Keep this up, I will have you removed from this courtroom. This is not how... Frank, we have to sit. Let me ask you something, Danny. You wanna give it another try with your mom and Rick? Or do you think you would be better off living with your dad? Dan... I'd like to stay with my mom and Rick. Thank you. You're welcome. hey. Look, Frank, I know what happened today, but... Well, I'm glad somebody does. Drink? I'm not gonna drink with you, Frank. That's too bad. You oughta go home. Hmm. Okay, Frank. Danny lied. Yeah. Again. But at least he's not living under the same roof with a killer. Oh, I'll drink to that. Mmm. No. This is how you lost Danny the first time. Huh. Come on, Frank. Let's go home. That's the best offer I've had in a while. You get fresh, Frank, I'll make it real. oh, Frank, uh... It's my day to see him, Susan. I know it is. - He, uh... - What? Listen, I tried talking to him, but he just went racing off. - Oh. - I'm sure he just feels badly about lying to you, so... - Oh. - I'm sure it'll be okay. I'm sorry. I have to go. But I'll tell him to call you. Okay. all right. See you. Hi. Hi. Cheeseburger, french fries, please. Okay. Can I get you anything to drink? Diet coke. sounds good. It took me 15 years to get one of these. How long you been here? Been here about two years, but I plan on being here for a long time. At the rate you're going, we'll be naming the town after you. Thanks a lot. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I'd just like to say thank you to the men and women of Southport... for recognizing me with this honor. I feel flattered to be included. Hey, Dan. Hey, dad. - You're a hard man to get ahold of lately. - What are you doing here? - What is this about, Frank? - I'm just trying to talk to my son, Rick. - At 10:00 at night? - It's not your business. Frank, do you really think... That showing up here drunk in front of your son... Is that supposed to make him wanna spend more time around you? - Hey! - Frank, bust it up. - Are you crazy, Frank? What are you doing? - Screw you, Patterson. Just because this asshole's got some money to spread around... you don't give a shit who he is. Look, dad, why don't you just go home. Just relax, sweetheart. He's fine. Dad, you dropped your wallet. Dad, wait up. Sorry, Dan. I shouldn't have come here. You dropped your wallet. That's not my wallet, Dan. Dad, you gotta stop making trouble for him. So, dad, just please, just lay off, okay? Hey, how are ya? What do you want? Oh, nothing much. Just five bucks. You wouldn't happen to have five bucks you could lend your old stepdad, would ya? No. You don't? Maybe we should check your wallet. Where's your wallet, Danny? I don't know. You don't know? Don't you think you should probably start looking for it? I really hope you didn't lose that, Dan. - Start looking for it. - I didn't tell him anything. Maybe you think I've just been foolin' around with you. Is that it, Danny? No. All I did was say I was sorry for not being hom... Bullshit! I swear to god, that's all I said. you're a little fuckin' liar, aren't you, Danny? I'm telling the truth, Rick. I hope so. Sir, does Ray Coleman sound familiar to you? Ray Coleman? Yeah. That name doesn't sound familiar. Would you check your registry? Because my sister's really worried about him. Sure. Here we go. Ray Coleman. Checked in on September 8. Mm-hmm. And checked out on... Check the 18th. Yeah. October 18. How about a telephone number, address? I could check his bill. Yeah. yeah. Okay. Here we go. ?C.? Coleman. These are just some local calls. Yeah? What's this? - Pizza hut. Ah. How about this? He called this a lot. Yeah. He liked the ladies. Hmm. You Patty? Who are you? a friend of Ray's. Ray? Coleman. That little shit owes me money. Join the club. Can I talk to you? I don't know Ray that well. We were just killing time. You know how it is. Yeah. I can't believe this guy. I mean, he never even tells you where he's from? No. Mmm. What would you guys talk about? We didn't do that much talkin'. Hmm. When we weren't doin' that, we were watching tv. I don't know what Ray likes better, to screw or watch basketball. Hmm. At least he gave me this. I know that lighter. Let me see? Oh, yeah. It was my birthday a couple weeks ago. Yeah, I like this lighter. Yeah. It's not even real. Yeah, but I like the, uh, horseshoe thing. buy it from you. How much? I don't know. It's a pretty nice lighter. Twenty-five bucks. Cool. If you'd just have this dusted for prints. I'm sure we'll find that this Ray Coleman's got a record, and if he does, we know that Rick Barnes will have one too. A lot of people have handled this lighter. The lab could only manage to lift off one clean set of prints. It turns out they belong to a convicted felon. Her name is Patty Walsh. Prostitution, drug use. Hey, Frank. I'm glad I ran into you. Listen, about last night, we both got a little bit hot under the collar, and I feel terrible about it. Recognize that? Hmm? Probably fell out of Ray's pocket when you pulled him from the truck. What are you doing, Frank? You touch... so much as one hair on my son's head, and I swear, as god is my witness, That'll be the last thing you ever do in this world. You're the second guy today who's been in here looking for Ray Coleman. You again? What do you want? What basketball team did he root for? What are you talking about? You said that he liked to screw and watch basketball. What team did he root for? Oh, god. Is detective Stevens there? No, this is Frank Morrison. Well, when will he be back? uh... okay, um... All right, do you have an e-mail address there? Right. Thank you. N-no, wait. Wait, listen. When he gets in, have him check his e-mail. Tell him to call Frank Morrison at the boathouse as soon as he gets it. Thank you. Aaah! Jesus! As you can see, this venerable building, a longtime fixture in the Southport community, continues to burn. Firefighters from three area townships have been called in to battle the blaze... It just keeps ringing, mom. It's okay, sweetheart. You know how careful dad is. I'm sure he's fine. He's fine. No, mom. Rick said he'd do this. He said he'd hurt dad. He killed a guy like I said, and he threatened to kill dad too. - What? - Forget it, mom. You won't believe me anyway. Danny, wh... what are you talking about? Oh, god. Danny, we're getting out of here. - Mom? - Now. Okay. Okay. Oh, hi, sweetheart. I didn't hear you come in. I just got back. Danny, you go wait in the car. All right. Where you goin'? There was a fire at Frank's. The boathouse burned down. -What? It was on the news. Danny wants to go and make sure Frank is okay. - you want me to take you? - it's okay. Danny's upset. I think that it's best if I take him alone. okay? Okay. Stevens. What is this? Frank Morrison sent it over. Rick Barnes, indicted for extortion, bribery, attempted murder. His real name is Jack Parnell. You reckon the Chicago Chamber of Commerce gave him an award too? Hello. Hello? - Hello? - Susan, it's Frank. Listen, you and Danny get out of the house now! I know, Frank, I know. I'm in the car with Danny. We're... Susan? I think I'd better drive Danny. I'm fine, Rick. I'm fine. Get out of the car, Susan. Mom? it's okay... It's okay. I just need to hang onto him till I'm someplace safe. Please don't do this. Please. - Mom, are you all right? - give me the keys. Take me instead. Please. You were the best thing that ever happened to me. go, Danny! run, Danny! Danny, go lock the doors and windows in the living room. Oh, jesus! fuck! - Did you lock everything? - Yeah. Did you call the police? Ohh! Run! Leave him alone! Mom. mom, get up. Mom, wake up. Mom, please get up. Get up. Sit still. Aah! Danny. You sure you're gonna be okay? I'll be fine, mom. Hey, we'll follow you to the hospital. Yeah. Frank, I'm sorry. No. it's okay. It's okay. I'm sorry about the baby. Mom, I love you. I love you too, sweetheart. Mr. Morrison, hold on. There's really not a whole lot I can say right now except... Why don't you say it to him. Danny, I'm sorry. It's all right.
