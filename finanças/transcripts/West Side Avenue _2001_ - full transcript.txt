I grew up without a father. I have a father, but my memories of him are all from when I was only seven years old. His image remains incomplete in me save for the rare picture my mother kept and brief memories of him taking care of me. When I was seven, he left. My mother wept for a long time, waiting, then looking for him. It almost drove her mad. Mom... You were feeling sad, child? Go home. The worms are eating our plants. Is it really you? How are you? This is a surprise. Two years without calling, then this early in the morning... Sorry about that. How are the kids? Fine. Asleep. Where? Where are they? In their bedrooms. Why? Hello, Johnny? Call in the daytime if you want to speak to them. They get home from school at three. You know... They've grown so much. When are you visiting again? Maryland is close, just a four-hour drive. Marlene... Johnny... How is mother? Sorry I couldn't visit. But I call the hospital regularly. Johnny? I was familiar with Hanzel Harana. I always saw him at West Side Avenue. One time, I even bumped into him. There is a great flood. I am sitting. I see mother by the old well. She tells me there is no water. I see myself swinging again. I fall without ever hitting the ground. "Dark. Someone's washing laundry. A girl. Someone speaks. I hear someone calling. Mother is leaving. I want to stop her but I can't move. All my teeth fall out again." Your teeth fell out? If I dream of my teeth falling out... some friend or relative will die. Really? When did you dream this? Many times, ever since I was a child. It's a real phenomenon. Many people have that experience. Really? - Yes. People have common dream experiences as well. They say dreams are part of reality because there is truth in our experiences there. There is a link between our conscious experiences and our dreams. When did you dream this? Let's hope none of your friends or relatives are affected... I wouldn't know. I've lost connection with my friends and relatives. How did you lose connection? Communication just stopped. Really? No letters? Telephone? E-mail? Did you cut off communication yourself? Why? Didn't have the time. A common experience, or practice, of many Filipinos here in America... Another phenomenon... Some of them change their names, their faces. Then they forget everything... their family, their past. When did you cut off communication? Long time ago. But I still talk to my ex-wife sometimes. Because of my children. They're in Maryland. Are they safe? They won't be affected by your dream? So, at the moment, you wouldn't know who was affected by your dream. A Filipino teenager died three days ago... At West Side Avenue. In Jersey City. What happened? He had a bullet wound in the head. Did you know him? No. But the face was familiar. I've seen him before. But that's probably not connected to your dream. Within the last six months... he's the fifth Filipino youth to die here. Yeah. I've heard of the two suicides here in New York. Yes. Shabu. Shabu is the curse of our people. This last decade... I can say the biggest percentage of criminals take meth. And you know what kind of crimes they commit. Frightening. Just read the daily papers from Manila. I know. Two years ago, when I worked in Makati... the majority of my clients were rich kids addicted to shabu. Whole families destroyed by shabu. Funny, isn't it? Poor man's cocaine, they call it. Nowadays, from Tondo to Forbes Park... It arrived on the West Coast, now here on the East Coast. It's the kind of drug you can say is "culturally" Filipino. How are you? Sorry, I was working on this new case. But don't stop writing down your dreams. Even if you miss a few sessions, keep going. Is it necessary? Well... In my system, yes. It's not just an exercise. I believe a man will be stronger emotionally, psychologically, even spiritually, if he analyzes his dreams, his memories. He acquires what I call "active introspection." Something like... an exorcism. ...so there is a cleansing within. Do you read the materials I gave you? Do you speak Tagalog? - Of course. Why are you filming this late at night? - Is it illegal? What are you shooting? - I'm making a documentary on Filipino youth. Hanzel Harana was in it. Do you know what happened to him? I heard. According to the police report, the crime happened around this time. Do you know anything? Did you hear anything, even just hearsay? Do you know anything? Nothing. I've just started. But this camera will catch plenty of stories. Even some truth, I hope. Are you a West Side resident? Fuck! Stop that! I found the pig that I was looking for. I kissed the wife of a friend. How are you? I'm sorry. I couldn't let you visit the house. I'm also sorry I couldn't come here earlier. It's okay. We'll schedule a visit... when you're able. I got permission from the Philippine Consulate. - Oh, good. So when will you bring home the... bring Hanzel home? I'm waiting for his father. He's coming. Is that so? When is he coming? Someone's helping him with his visa. He wants to be the one to bring Hanzel home. I wanted to ask... How's your investigation? Our initial findings are... The gun is a.22 caliber. The scratches on his face are from the fall. There are powder burns on his hands. We're following some leads, of course. I'm looking at some suspects. That's about it. I'm still looking for some witnesses... Waiting... Should I get a lawyer? Not yet. But it's up to you. You could make preparations. We need your help. We need information about Hanzel. You know... When did he arrive? When did you last see each other? Did he mention any problems? Did you notice anything? Do you know of any enemies, anyone angry with him? Anyone he's angry with? When you're ready, we'll have a long talk. I'd also like to take a look at all his things. Plus the studio he rented. I'm sorry, I just can't accept it... Call me when you're ready. Here are the numbers where you can reach me. Any time. I'm sure that's gonna win. I know you have a strong chance of winning, but... Good morning. You must be the father. I am Officer Juan Mijarez. Good morning, Mr. Abdon. When did you arrive? Yesterday. How is the Philippines? When do you plan to go home? As soon as possible. On the next day. I'll be the one taking my son home. I'm going home, too. Fuck you! If you ever come home to the Philippines, I'll kill you. This is all your fault! Let's just keep calm here. Don't worry. I'm handling this case. I won't let it go. It's so damn cold. It's snowing so early. Is it your fist time in America? Is Hanzel's grandpa coming with you? That's what he said. Whatever he likes. And Lolita? Hanzel was your eldest. Are you going to Mr. Abdon's place? I can take you there. I can walk. It's close by. If we can resolve the case... Can you come back for the hearing? Can you give my son justice? We'll try. Do you think... a Filipino killed my son? I don't know. Let's fix our strategy. We're not always on the scene. We're being eased out by Tong. Don't worry, I'll fix it up. We should plan our schedule. Can we talk? Sure. Where? Over there. People, keep steady, I'll be back. He sidelined in my shop some time ago. A loser, that Hanzel. He's a lousy mechanic and a lousy auto salesman. It's his fate. I don't want to waste time, Adan. I'll give it to you straight. You're one of the suspects in this case. Suspects? Why am I included? Don't worry. You're not being accused yet. We're still investigating. Your name just came up. When did you last see him? Spend any time with him? A long time ago. Last year. - When? October. - Yeah. I may have further questions. I'll call you. Mom! I'm so tired, child. Where did you come from? Mom, I'm hungry. Look for the horse. Your dad will get angry. I will fix our house. Look for the horse. Your dad will get angry. Are you okay there? - I'm okay, man. Go take a hit, man. Frederick! Tarzan, Jane's calling you. Score! Open this. Add some more for a big one. Have we run out of foil? That's done. - Fuck! Is that used up? - No, there's still some more. This will do. Fuck those neighbors! - Why? They think they're so good. What kind of band is that, it's like a circus! Let's go. Your hand is shaking. Press harder. It's 8 p.m. already. We have to go. Where are we going? - Adan is waiting for us. Bro, we'll go ahead. You didn't leave anything? Come on, man. Adan's waiting for us. Adan is really generous. He's got a lot of money. Always ready to buy a drink. He knows me. Hanzel and I worked part time at his shop. Fixing or selling used cars. I go along with him sometimes. Drinking, having fun... Adan is smart. He's fun to be with. You're selling shabu. Crystal meth. No, we're not. I've heard about Adan's shabu operation. I had nothing to do with that, sir. Frederick, you're not telling the truth. Hanzel was your friend. Please help us. Do you know what happened to him? Be our witness. We'll protect you. If I knew anything, I would have told the police. I'll go now, sir. I'll give you a ride. - No, thanks. Frederick... Call me. Please. Hanzel came here one summer, about two years ago. I took him in because he left his studies. Just hung out with friends, my relatives said. He wouldn't say a word when he arrived. Come on, son. Eat! You probably don't eat vegetables, is that right? Here. Meat. Want some? Son, why are you still awake? It's almost dawn. Is something bothering you? Don't worry. Before you know it, we'll all be together. Now that we have no money problems everything will be easier. You can all live here. You can all study here in America. When I left the Philippines, you were only seven. Now you're a young man. It happened so quickly. How's the youngest? He's fine. He'll be turning fourteen... How's your father? He started drinking heavily when he learned that you married an American. Go get some rest... It's almost morning. He was always out walking. Always alone. He would stay out for hours. I never thought Hanzel and Gordon would become close. Where did you go? I was worried sick. What took you so long? Go inside and eat. I'll take care of him. Your son is something else. A real attitude problem. Won't say a word to us. Asshole. Don't say that about him. He's not an asshole. He's not used to this. We haven't seen each other in thirteen years. We're still adjusting to each other. What if he finds out about us? That's why I'm telling you we should be careful. It's better if he finds out. He'll take it harder if he finds out by himself. We can't do that. He knows Gordon is my husband. I don't want him to think less of me. If we could even end this thing between us... What? That's enough. My conscience has been bothering me ever since Hanzel arrived. Conscience? Or shame? Are you ashamed of me? I decide if this ends or not! If you don't want this to end, then be careful. What are you ashamed of then? Hanzel knows that Gordon is my husband. You're staying with us. If he finds out about us, he will lose all respect for me. Why did you petition him anyway? He's just another problem. It's for Hanzel and my other four kids' sake that I took up this life. Because their father's useless. Warlito is not useless. - You said that. Why did you have so many children anyway? One for each year? Like a piggery? A whole passel of retards. Nothing to eat, yet more and more kids. Bartolo, please... Let's be careful. Okay... But... This can't last long. What will you do when he finds out? I don't know! Pass the milk! Clean that. Don't humiliate me like that again, okay? Hanzel only spent two months in my house. I left him with my dad in Jersey City. Dad... Good afternoon, grandpa. Hanzel, call me if you have problems, okay? Dad, I'll send him his allowance regularly. Okay, dad, I'll go now. Goodbye, son. Come inside. So, how are you now? - I'm okay, grandpa. You've grown so much. Unbelievable... You've grown up so fast. Go inside. May I smoke? - Go ahead. Do you smoke? - I used to... Bartolo... Has he lived here long? About... two years. Have you known him long? Four years. The old man... How did you meet him? When I was a nurse aide... I took care of him. He wasn't a paraplegic then. Then he courted me. I accepted his proposal for the sake of my children. When we married... the attacks soon followed. He never recovered. No matter what therapy he took. His motoric system's wrecked. He can't move. He can't even speak. He's... not doing very well now. Does he have a family? Relatives? In California. But they don't speak. He's angry at them... But he doesn't tell me. Once, three years ago, some of them visited. They looked at me like I was dirt. They saw me as... an opportunist. They would call me on the phone... Calling me a bitch, slut, Filipino cunt... The things they said... I took it. I cried a little. After a while, they got tired. Gordon is a good man. I couldn't leave him. He wanted to adopt my children. Coffee, man. - Thank you. Looking busy. - Yep. Lots of snow. See you. Was there any friction between Hanzel and Bartolo? Quarrels... Fights? Why? Well... You know... Do you suspect Bartolo? It's just a background check-up. Anyone can be a suspect. My son didn't speak to him. Didn't notice him. They didn't talk to each other. What did you do before you lived here? Plenty of jobs. All kinds. What about you? Before you became a cop, what did you do? I had plenty of jobs too. All kinds as well. But I have to give it to you, man. A Filipino cop in America? That's something else. There are plenty of Filipino cops here. When did you come to America? Are you investigating me? Just police routine. I had nothing to do with that kid. Just his bad luck catching up with him. You two didn't get along? Who said that? Lolita. Lolita? Fuck, she better not be accusing me, okay? She wasn't accusing you. All she said was you and Hanzel didn't get along. Mother and son didn't get along. Even if we weren't friends, what is it to me! You were mad at the kid. You didn't want him here. She said that? Fuck you, Lolita! What did you tell the police that they're investigating me now? All I said was that you and Hanzel weren't on speaking terms. That big mouth of yours... I could arrest you for what you've done. Hell of a temper. And he does that in front of your husband? He's more arrogant than the owner of this house? Please leave us alone. Does he hurt you? When I first saw you, in the morgue you seemed to have bruises on the cheek and neck. Please! Sorry. I was just surprised at what he did. Anyway, I'm witness to what he did. I'm putting it on the blotter. If you ever have a problem with Bartolo, call me and Falcon. You'll grow up an idiot if you don't stop watching TV all night. Turn it off. Books... Read, so you will learn. Those books are all yours. I don't read books, grandpa. What? You don't read books? Your parents are crazy. How many times have I told your parents to teach their children to read. Because it is only through reading that they will gain a deeper education. Crazy. I remember when I spent my vacation in the Philippines... You were only three years old then. Your parents were crazy. They fought every day. They were separating... Then reuniting... They didn't even have any money. I had to take care of you and your siblings. My advice to you is... Read the newspapers every day. Read the Philippine history books. So you will understand the struggles of our people. Is that clear? - Yes, grandpa. Please read so you'll learn. I'm going to sleep now. By the way... Take the dictionary and the thesaurus... Anything you don't understand, look it up. Okay? Okay, grandpa. Why didn't you have any pork blood pudding? I don't eat that, grandpa. Why? Are you a member of the Iglesia ni Cristo? -No! And you're not a Muslim. - I am a Muslim, grandpa. Muslim? But your parents are Catholics. How come? My girlfriend is a Muslim, grandpa. She's from Mindanao... She had me converted. Oh, it's because of a girl, huh? - Yes, grandpa. And how's your religion? - It's okay, grandpa. For me, religion divides people. I've long since had a personal relationship with God. How's the Muslim girl now? - She's married, grandpa. Are you bullshitting me, Hanzel? - No, grandpa. An arranged marriage. Arranged marriage, huh? - That's how they do it in Maguindanao. I was so mad at first. But I couldn't really do anything about it. That's why I agreed to come. I didn't really want to come here. Are you okay now? Yes, I'm okay, grandpa. So, tell me about your Muslim girl. She's alright, grandpa. You know, she's pretty. She's a bit short. I can sense that she's very nice. What's her name? - Tonina Salamat. Tonina Salamat? Nice name. She's very pretty, simple, and sweet. Your late grandma, Juana, was my thirteenth girlfriend. My real love was a mountain lass, an Ifugao. - Ifugao? - Yeah. We met during the guerilla days of the war. My unit ambushed a Japanese platoon. We were outsmarted... Two more platoons reinforced them. They caught us by surprise... It was a massacre. They got me with a bullet on my back. I collapsed in a grassy area. Fortunately, they didn't find me. I woke up among the Ifugaos. One of the nurses was the most beautiful woman I ever saw. Her name was Ayaya. To me she was the prettiest woman in the whole world. Really, grandpa? - Yes. And do you know what happened to us? - What? The same thing that happened between you and your girlfriend. - Really? She had an arranged marriage as well. - You and I have the same fate, grandpa. It was just like the time when I was taking care of them. He was happy when we went fishing. Finally, he was reading. He was finally doing something with his life. What a waste! This was his favorite spot. He liked the calm sea. Where he couldn't see anything. We wanted to try deep sea fishing. But now that's off... He's gone. How was the funeral in the Philippines? I cannot forget the funeral of my grandson. I can still see the faces of his siblings. I can still hear their wailing... their loud cries mourning the loss of their beloved brother. They didn't want to let the coffin go. They were all holding each other. They didn't want to let him go. They didn't want to part... from their dear eldest brother. What happened to Hanzel... is the same thing that's happening to the Philippines. Nothing has any direction. The efforts of our heroes have gone to waste. That's why, Mijarez, it is up to your generation to act while there is still time. You must do something to heal our despondent land. I miss my brothers and sisters. Dad. I don't want to go back to Manila. It's so dirty, hot, polluted. I don't like it here. I'm not American. I don't belong here. Are you okay, man? Who are they? But they're Filipinos. Good evening, grandpa. Open it so you can use it. Go get some sleep. I'm not sleepy yet, grandpa. What are you doing? I'm writing to dad, and to my brothers and sisters. I still have to print it. Why? - My penmanship is bad. They keep complaining. They can't read what I write. Like a doctor's penmanship? I'll make some myself later. It's okay. Let me do it. Finish your letters. Okay, grandpa. Hey guys, aren't you hungry? Let's have noodles. It's for good luck. Lenghtens the lifespan. Look, Dolores... It's gone. I pressed this button and then it got deleted. No. You're messy. Grandpa, where did you get the idea that eating noodles can prolong life? It's just an old belief. Yes. Delicious. Yes, sir! You can do it! With a little practice, you'll be able to speak Tagalog well. His mother had money... He wanted his mother to go home? C'mon, so you won't get bored. Bro, are you going to iron again? Yup, got to iron. - You just ironed. Think of the electricity. Where are you going? Mr. Desolation Angel's hiding in some corner. Check out the cabinet. Or inside the fridge... Nothing. I want to go home. I'm not okay. I'm bringing my mom home. I'll bring my mom home. Fuck! That's not a crazy idea! I thought you wanted to talk to your mom? Bartolo, come here! Why? These are Hanzel's friends. Fix them something to eat. We have plenty of food. Go down now, leave him. Go eat downstairs. - Why are you neglecting Gordon? We're not neglecting him. Yes, you are. He hasn't taken a bath. He smells bad and his food is rotten. Hanzel, go and eat. Your friends are downstairs. Come. I want to talk to you, mom. About what? Let's go home, mom. You want to go back to the Philippines? Us, mom. You, too. I don't know... It's been so long... So much has happened. We are all waiting for you, mom. Not your father. He'll kill me. - That's not true! Dad loves you. He's too proud. If he hadn't had that accident, he wouldn't be accepting money from me. It's your fault! You're the one who left, right? You would have starved to death if I had not left. If I had not acted, you would have gone begging. You would have starved. Do you understand that, Hanzel? Then why did you marry someone else? I had to do it. I didn't want to, but I had to. Let's go home... I would rather bring you all here. My brothers and sisters won't come here. They won't leave dad... I can't go back home to your father. You can, mom! You don't understand what I'm saying! I can't go back to your father! Is it because of Bartolo? No. Fuck! I saw you together! You made a fool of dad, and now you're making a fool of Gordon. You're like a whore! Don't call me a whore, Hanzel. I sold my soul for you! I sacrificed everything for you. Why don't you leave me alone! Because she's really crazy, you know... She might get hit by a car, walk around naked... Do you want to sleep now? You sleep in the bedroom. It's Chiquito! How about Bert Tawa Marcelo? It's Yoyoy! It's Imelda! Laughing for pleasure! It's just for fun, you know. Let me have some! I've had enough. Come again? - I'm tired... I'm sleepy. What do you mean you're tired? We're supermen. Supermen! We don't get tired. Come on, Hanzel. You and Frederick are so cool. You've got gorgeous chicks. Me, I kicked her out. She doesn't listen. Bird-brained. Shit-brained. Pea-brained. Not professional. It would embarrass Dolores, you know. So what if Dolores finds out? I don't want her to think less of me. What is happening to you? Okay... So you want to leave now? You're leaving? - No, I just want to rest. Before you take a rest, let's take another hit, okay? I'll go ahead, Dindo. Stay where you are, Hanzel, we still have stuff here, okay? Let's have a hit first. Light it up. You need it. You take too few hits. There's still some. You serve. Fuck that Gary. Real arrogant, man. We should kill him, would you like that? Better do them in first, the fuckers. Yeah, man, we'll talk about it. Just a minute. I'll be back. Hanzel, how are you? Are you okay? - I'm okay, sir. Great chick you have there... Real cool. You know how to pick them. Come with us. - Where, sir? We'll just make rounds. Make a lot of money, See the world. And be a ruler. Ah... Some other time, sir. Take care, sir. Hey man, this is work. You are in. Man, this is money. Come, take your leave of Dolores. Tell her you've got a job to apply for. What job? - Fuck do I know! Delivery, man. It's popular around here. Go, man. Move! I'm going for a job. Well, I did. Delivery. I have to go with them now. The job starts immediately. Never mind. I've talked to Frederick. They'll take care of me. We have to work now. Are you going home? Let's see... Okay, I'll be there. I'll go to school tomorrow. Think about it. Killing is part of the line of duty. You've killed before, of course, in the line of duty. What kind of experience is it, killing for the first time? I never knew I could do it. I always dream of a man crying. I can see him in my dreams. Sometimes... even when I'm awake, I see him in the dark. Looking at me. Took a long time for the dreams to stop. I've read the journal of an investigator like you. This is the common experience among first time killers. Whose is the face you see? Is it the man you killed? The face changes. Sometimes it's me. I'm the one crying. Sometimes a friend. Sometimes it's my mother. It isn't clear, but I know it's her. It's a dream, after all. Any guilt? You can't avoid it, especially in the beginning. Unless, of course, you're a psychotic killer. No guilt, no remorse. Who was the first person you killed? Porfirio Dumadag... A student. This was in the Philippines? - Yes. In the University of the East. What happened? How did you kill him? Your team. - Fuckin' shit. This is our new Propaganda Movement. A new Philippine Revolt. Shabu is our new Cultural Revolution. We'll turn every Filipino into patriots like Rizal, López Jaena and Mabini. We'll turn them all into Bonifacio. We'll turn them all into Mao Zedong. We'll turn them all into Jesus Christ! Every Filipino will become a superman. Shabu is the redemption of the Filipino. Let's try the latest product. Get the foil, man. Hanzel! Grandpa... Good evening. I have something for you... - I don't need that. You've been gone for a week without calling. What's happening to you? What about your studies? Grandpa, I've got a job. What kind of job? Delivery, grandpa. - Delivery of what? Transportation to the airport. People moving houses... Delivery of goods... Ah... Delivery of goods? What kind of goods? Things, grandpa. Things, huh? - Yes. I've heard that you're hanging out with that hustler Frederick. I've heard a lot about that kid. He's kind, grandpa. I've also heard about that rumble in the restaurant. Shameful! You're becoming a big liar like your mother! Put your life in order! Do the right thing! Hanzel, what are you doing here? Can I sleep over? - Sure. Why didn't you use the buzzer? Here's the buzzer. I forgot. I have such a headache. Good thing I came out or else you'd have frozen here. Come in. Is Frederick there? Yes. He's on the couch. He'll be unconscious for a week. Fuck. Our neighbor seems to be spying on us. Neighbors are always spying on us. Damn those neighbors. I don't know what to do anymore. Come inside. Where's Dahlia? She vanished. They fought... Couldn't handcuff her in time, so she's gone. Look at this mess. Those two are such pigs. Frederick, wake up! Clean up your mess! I don't care what happens to you! You go ahead... Get a pillow and a blanket. I'm running late. Gotta be a professional Filipino. What time do you have to go to work? It's none of your business. Want a necktie? It's new. I just bought this today. Perfect. I don't have a tie. I'll take it. But why are you giving me a tie? It was for my grandpa, but he didn't want it. You can have it. It suits you. It looks okay, but the color's a bit old-fashioned. It was supposed to be for my grandpa. Do you know what color I prefer? - What color? Ever heard of the movie Cadillac? Why pink? It's my favorite shabu extract. You're early. I won't be late. My job is important to me. I'm a professional. What time is your work? Nine. But it's only two thirty in the morning. It's better if I'm here when the office opens. Then I just have to go in. Let's have coffee first. No, thanks. We have coffee inside. C'mon, we'll be back right away. - I don't want to be late and lose my job. Cigarette? It's not allowed in the office. Thanks. But there's no one around. And you're outside. I'm just being careful. Someone might see me. Where were you when Hanzel was shot? I was here. It was raining. I had an umbrella. What do you know about Hanzel Harana? He was my brother's friend. He was cool. Nice. Who do you think killed him? I don't know. Any suspects? I don't know. I know nothing about that. Have you been doing shabu long? Shabu? Why the fuck would I do shabu? I'm a professional with a job. I know you do shabu. - I don't do shabu. Help us, Dindo. If you know who killed Hanzel, help us. We have a witness protection program. You'll be safe. I know nothing about that. Nothing. How about Adan's shabu operation? Nothing. Why would I do shabu? I'm a professional. I'm clean. Clean? I know why you're here at this hour. Shabu's been eating away your brains. Shabu's been chewing your nerves. Your paranoia's getting worse, Dindo. Don't let me catch you... or I will skin you alive. Later, sir. I'm looking for someone. You didn't show up for your appointment at the precinct. I got to go. You fuckin' shit! You're important to this case. Do you understand that? If you don't want us bothering you, give us some leads. I don't know anything about it, sir. Don't make me lose my patience. You fuck! You don't know what I can do to you. What do you know? Just some suspicions... - Who do you suspect? Gary. - Why? We beat him up... Our gangs have been fighting. What about Adan? - I don't know. Tong? - I don't know. Hanzel lived with you? Three months. December until February. What did he do while he was with you? He helped me in Adan's shop. That's where we work. You were selling shabu! - No way, sir. We helped repair engines. We weren't! Go! Fuckin' shit! What a lousy Christmas. No money. No life. No fucking deals. I'm losing my hair. That's okay, Ruben. Hey, it's your turn. - Motherfucker. Be patient, Sir Ruben. That's life for you. What's that fucking racket? Check it out, man, that fucker has been too loud for a while now. Hey. He's okay. It's the effect of the drugs. He's stoned asleep. He's just sleeping. You're too loud. Why? Almost dead... The idiot! My head hurts. Hey! Crazy whore! You wanted to tip us off to the police? Shut up, fuck off! I'm talking to her. Out, out! Set your whore girlfriend straight, okay? Or you'll be laid out in a grave, side by side. Good evening, ma'am. Is Dolores here? She's not here! He was gone for a month. Not even a phone call. We don't even know where he went. Are you okay, man? I looked for him. I had people look for him. I paid two Filipinos, friends of Bartolo's... They never saw him. I called the Philippines... Maybe he went home. Nothing. You weren't scared that something might have happened? I was worried, yes. I couldn't sleep sometimes. But, you know, I'm his mother. I could feel that he's just out there. And he called Dolores sometimes. Did he say anything to Dolores? He called to ask how she was. Hello, man. Where's the party? Fuck, Long Island, man? I might not be able to go. Dahlia's sick. Wait for me at seven... I'll bring the goods. I'll leave it to you. Bro, someone's at the door. Can't you see I'm in a hurry? I don't want to be late. Bro, it's only ten in the evening. Why don't you just live in your office? Hello? I've got to go. Just wait for me. How are you? Fuck, man, you look like Johnny Rotten. Where have you been? People are looking for you. How are you? You're a mess, man. Frederick, don't trust the neighbors. Lock the door. I'll take care of it. Bye. It was February when he appeared at our place. When he came back, he stopped working in Adan's shop. He transferred to Tong's karaoke bar. Don't worry about Adan. The reason we parted ways is because he's satisfied with small-time deals. I gave him the idea that shabu can save the Philippines. It's the hope of our country. The best thing about shabu is, the stronger its effect, it beats heroin, cocaine, or crack. When the whole world discovers it... Shabu is the emancipation of the Filipino. We need the government to support its mass production. A congressman should pass a bill to make it a national industry. Shabu is the oil of the Philippines. Even America will buy it. This is the idea Adan is pushing, right, Hanzel? Mine. The asshole's stealing my vision. I taught that jerk everything about life! It's like this. I used to be a schoolteacher. I don't want to teach here, too much hassle. What was I to do, jack off? Adan is a doctor. He wasn't wanted, either. Flunked the board exam three times. Three times! Got disillusioned. Wanted to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. I turned him to shabu. I saved him! And now, the bastard's my rival in the operations. That son of a bitch! What's he doing here? He's with Tong. Fuck! He's Adan's guy! Call Tong... Go tell him. Tell Tong. I brought some new stuff. This is completely different, man. Try this, bro. This is new. Hand me that. Wait a minute. - Okay. What's the problem, man? It's Hanzel. Let's talk about it. - Don't you trust me? He works for Adan. - No, he's with us. Allan, come here. Can you take Hanzel to the room first? Now? - Yes. I'll take care of it. He was an all around guy. Waiter, designer, bouncer, janitor. You know he worked for Adan? Yeah. So, no problem, right? Adan is your enemy. Enemy? Why should he be my enemy? Hanzel became your boy. He last worked for you. That's right. Waiter, bouncer. He pushed your shabu. Shabu? Where did you pick up that piece of fiction? You and Adan de Jesus started shabu operations here in New York and Jersey City. The shop is just a front. And then the two of you fought and split operations. What shabu are you talking about? We knew each other from the shop. I'm going to open some branches. Don't you know my business is doing well? I lead a comfortable life. I'm going to open branches in other counties. West Side, Woodside, Virginia, Toronto, Australia, Alaska... Wherever there are a lot of Filipinos. I believe that karaoke is the future of the Filipinos. Don't you know that karaoke started in the Philippines? Adan and I differed in point of view. We couldn't come to an agreement. He's a doctor. I'm a teacher. Big difference. I regret being in business with him. He was cheating me at the tills. Where were you at the time of the shooting? - I was singing. There's a karaoke contest in Passaic. You can check in the Southern Bar. Some Tibetan beat me by one vote. One vote! But I got the bigger applause. And my piece was better. I sang Because of You. My rival sang Stairway to Heaven. Because of You... Nothing can top that. Every time I hear that song I feel... very profound. So deep, sincere. Do you want to sing? I don't sing. Let's talk again sometime. I'll call you. Mother searched everywhere for my father. She would leave me with her friends and relatives. That was my life when I was young. When I reached high school, she stopped. She worked to keep me in school. I paid back her sacrifice. I finished in the top five in my graduating class. I was accepted to the Philippine Military Academy. They sent me to West Point. It's my birthday. Let's get high for a week. We'll start here at the shop, we'll end at Atlantic. So everybody's happy. Here's your gift. - Wow. Fuck. You didn't have to. And on the seventh day, we'll find the traitor who betrayed Christ. We'll sentence Peter on the third crow of the rooster. Did you get what I'm saying? We'll sentence Peter on the third crow of the rooster. Frederick knows who the traitor is, am I right? Right, Frederick? Right, Frederick? Get out! Get out! You fucking shit! You should have backed out, instead you defected to Tong! You fucking shit! I'll kill you! Adan, don't! Frederick, you're a fool to bring in such a sleaze. Doesn't this dream say anything to you? I don't know... What did you feel when you woke up? Guilt towards whom? I don't know. Not your mother? I don't know. Towards your ex-wife and two kids? To those you killed? Hello, dad? Bartolo... Is it true about Hanzel? You've heard. I don't know. That's what they say. Go to Jersey City. Find out the truth. When I get back. I'm going to the Atlantic. Give me 3,000. 3,000? I don't have that kind of money. What do you mean? How many times have you been gambling in Atlantic City? How many thousands have you lost? I win sometimes. Hurry up, they're waiting. - I have no money. What do you mean? Will you give me money or not? - I told you, I have no money! Shut up. Take it off my salary. Come on! You know me... Will you give me money... or not? I'll come back soon. Don't come back at all if you like! Hi. I'm Hanzel's mother. Is Dolores there? - Why? She might know where Hanzel is. Come in. Sit down. I'll call up Dolores at work. Dolores, listen... Hanzel's mother is here. She's looking for him. Would you know where he is? Sure, I'll tell her. Bye. He's at Vicky's Restaurant along West Side. You'd better hurry. Okay, thank you. Where were you last night? - I stayed at home. When I woke up, the snow was all over. I'll go inside. Tell him I want to talk to him. - Okay, ma'am, I'll tell him. Your mom wants to talk to you. Get rid of her. I don't want to talk. That's your mom. - So what? She'll just ruin my day. Get rid of her. Okay, it's your call. I told him, ma'am, but he won't talk. At that point... I felt that I lost my son. You have estafa and swindling cases back in the Philippines. Which you ran away from. That's not true. Interpol gave us the information. There are records in Quezon City and Olongapo. 1.2 million pesos from your former recruitment agency. And then... Fake land titles in Zambales. Those cases are all in the Philippines. And I was never convicted. I'm clean here. Flight is an admission of guilt. We can send you back to the Philippines. If you can. I'm not stupid. From the moment Hanzel left... how many times did you see him? I saw him and Dolores in a mall in Jersey City. Then the two of them with grandpa Abdon at the park. But the last time I saw him... Dr. Perez is all yours now, Hanzel. I've had enough. So you're doing charity work now, huh? I'm not giving away money, I'm just lending it to you. Right, Hanzel? You can have Dr. Perez anytime. - Sure thing. Can I have some? Fuck you, man! No way, you're too greedy. Give some to Hanzel. No way, I work hard for that shit. Yo, Hanzel, check this out, man. Bartolo's here. Take it easy, man. It's all cool, it's all good. Can we dance? Let's dance! Come on! Please excuse him. I'm Hanzel. And he's my mother's lover! Get him before I... So why don't you? You son of a bitch! Bastard! - Well, you're a bastard as well! He's a bastard. No. no. Never mind. It's nothing. Good location you got here. How much? 850, Sir Tong. 850? Here on West Side Avenue, that's cheap. I'm running for congress in the Philippines in the next election. Sure. You should, Sir Tong. Don't waste your brains. After four years, I'll run for President. President Cristituto Paredes. I'm going back to the Philippines. When I'm President, when I'm in Malacañang... I'll appoint all of you to my cabinet. We'll mass-produce shabu. I'm already going to start negotiations with the CIA, the mafia, the yakuza, the drug lords in South America, Russia, Europe, to keep operations smooth. Man, I tell you, the Philippines will be a world power. Shabu is the hope of the Philippines. There will be a quantum leap. From Third World to world power. Start an economic big bang! But, Sir Tong... Will America play along? Will the CIA? Sure. They'll get the biggest percentage. That's what America is best at, market percentages. Sir Tong is very overwhelming... Sir Tong, what about the mafia or the yakuza? Fuck. They'll be the ones to approach us. Believe me. We'll have influence even with the underground. But, Sir Tong... First we must patent shabu! The big Western corporations might steal the idea. Do you remember coconut jelly? - Yes. America and Japan have hardly any coconuts... yet they hold the patent. Shabu is ours, man. No one must take it from us. She was naked in the street. I forgot to handcuff her. Good thing it was dawn so no one saw her. You know Dahlia's crazy. I bought it. I'll kill Adan. What? - I can kill Adan. That's not funny. - I'm not kidding. I'll kill the fucker. What am I talking about? Don't you remember? He pointed a gun at us. Come on, Dolores. What about you, Frederick? If what happened to us happened to you, what would you do? Timing... Timing is all it takes. That son of a bitch. I could have shot you earlier. No one would've known. I've been waiting for you for three nights now. I knew you've been following me this last week. I had plenty of chances, but I never touched you. I respect your style... You're objective. And you're... so Filipino. You don't want to arrest your suspects because they're Filipinos. I salute you. You're a true nationalist. I still don't have evidence, so I can't make an arrest. That's why you should stop, there isn't any. I can just finish you now. Then I won't have any more problems with you. Go ahead! Go ahead! He seems heavier now. Why don't we just kill the asshole! Don't, Bartolo. Have pity on him. Same thing. Poison him. Or push him down the stairs. Drown him in the bathtub. Bartolo, I can't do those things. Have mercy on him. If you can't do it... I'll do it. Bartolo, I'm begging you. Don't do it. I'll give you whatever you want. Just don't hurt him. The asshole's money is going to waste. He can't spend it. Martial law is good for the country. True or false? Press the button. Ronnie, answer the question. Martial law is good for the country. True or false? Ronnie, answer the question. - Press the button! Ronnie, please, answer the question. - He's already dead, you idiots! Sorry, I spilled the soup. I'll cook some more. Fuck, how clumsy can you get? Go make some more. Go... Go! Wait. Forget it. Come sit beside me. Later, I'm busy! Wait! - No, I'm busy! Hello, grandpa... How are you? I'm fine, grandpa. Come in. So we learned that the Japanese were retreating... They killed a lot of Filipinos. Just as if they were killing chickens. Many committed suicide. Despite the darkness, Filipinos were celebrating victory. Before MacArthur arrived, the Americans had destroyed Manila. The American bombings did the most damage. MacArthur went to Japan... The Philippines had become a big joke to the Americans. We're such a pitiful country. Grandpa? - Yes? How many people did you kill in the war? A lot. - A lot? How did you execute the collaborators? We shot them in the head. We blew their brains out. Then we'd leave their bodies in the plaza to serve as a warning to the others. We pulled their skin off from foot to knee. That's war, son. It's better to kill than to be killed. That's how war is. War is truly horrifying. All the evils you can name are there. Rape, pillage, killings... You're too young to know these things. I don't want to go through another war. It's too painful. Much more painful than anything in this world... Grandpa! God bless you. - Let's go upstairs. This is the bedroom. Is my place okay, grandpa? - Oh, yes. Why don't you bring your computer here? I'll leave it at your place. I'll just come over if I need it. So I can eat Chinese food. Just don't tell war stories. I brought some books for you. Thank you! You'll also need these two. I'll put them there. - Okay, grandpa. Why do you have a gun in here? I don't want to judge you. And I don't want to get angry. I understand you. But I hope that you get over this mess that you're in. You're still young and strong... I have great hopes for you. ...we were together. He bought new fishing rods. He told me stories. He talked and talked. When I was young, when we had money, mom and dad would bring us to the beach in Cavite, and we'd roast freshly caught fish. Dad would teach us how to swim. Do you know how to swim, grandpa? Of course, but now, I can't take the pressure. Grandpa, I could swim from here to the Philippines! I can do it! Impossible! I dreamt it, grandpa. I swam from here and reached our shores. In your dreams, of course... But, sometimes, I can't get there... I drown. I can't breathe... It's frightening. How's Hanzel? Please tell me the truth. I heard he's become a drug user. Tell me the truth, please. Do you know where he lives? Can you go there with me? I just want to talk to him. What? Why did you bring her here? Why did you tell her where I live? Dolores, I'm not hiding from her. I don't want to see her or talk to her. You know that, don't you? You don't understand anything. You didn't go through what I went through. Make her leave. It's not Dolores' fault. From now on, I won't interfere in your life. I'm just asking you... to be careful what you do. I've been hearing a lot of things about you... about what you're doing. What have I been doing? Dolores, I'll go ahead... Hello, good evening, ma'am. Is Dolores there? Frederick, man, this is Hanzel. Call Dolores, will you? Her mother's pissed at me. Tell her I'll see her at... Tell her I want to talk somewhere near her place. I'll wait for your call, man. See you, man. Thank you. Hello, man. Oh, really? What time? Exactly twelve thirty? Okay, man, thanks. I heard him talking on the phone. When I came out of my room, he had already left. Too bad I wasn't able to talk to him. He left a letter. Dolores printed it out for me. It's a farewell note. Do you think he committed suicide? I don't know. Okay. If you need anything, just call me. Okay. Keep it. I just want to talk to you. Your mom's pissed. Why did you tell her what happened? I couldn't stand it... I'm sorry for what I said. It won't happen again. I said I was sorry. You were the last person to see him? I'll go now, Dolores. Mom, mom... Mom. Mom, mom... This is Hanzel, mom. Aren't you gonna take that call? It's your son. Mom? Mom? Mom, it's Hanzel... Mom... Mom... Mom... If only I had talked to him on the phone. I can never forgive myself for what happened to my son. If you had talked to him... What would he have said? What do you think was on his mind that night? He would have... asked us to go home. I know that was what my son had been thinking of. I'm going home. It's too late for Hanzel. I hope it's not too late for my other four children. I still don't know if leaving them the way I did was the right thing. Do you think I did the right thing? Are we good parents? I don't know. You can still change your decision. Johnny, hi, how are you? They're turning off mother's respirator tomorrow. Should I be there? No, we're cremating her immediately. I'll have a mass said for her and I'll tell the kids. Are you okay? I don't know... Have I made the right decision? I don't know, Johnny. Do you want to talk to your kids? They're outside, playing. I'll call them. Marlene... Johnny? Marlene... Come back. Johnny... We're better off this way. I already have my own life. Please forgive me. I've already forgiven you. Let's forget the bad times. Just help me raise our children. Marlene... Respect my decision, Johnny. Please. Fuck you! What are you doing here? Get out! And don't come back! Did you talk to him before he disappeared? Before he left? He said he was going to Atlantic City. And he was not coming back. Did he give a reason why he was leaving? I'm thankful to God that he left. You said he stole a lot of money. He took all my jewelry... including Gordon's. He also took 50,000 dollars. He also stole one of our cars. No threats? Did he threaten you? He has been threatening me for a long time. Don't worry. I'll forward his case to the police network nationwide. You're his fifth victim. Bartolo is a hustler and an opportunist. He's a leech, an animal. He preys on wealthy Filipinas. Vulnerable Filipinas in this area. In case he calls you up and tells you where he is... call us at our hotline number. Where is Mr. Fordham? He's in the hospital. He had another attack. Okay... Take care. Thank you. How's your investigation into the Hanzel Harana case? I resigned. Falcon's handling the case. Why did you resign? I was at a dead end. I've had enough. If I continued working on this case... I might have killed a lot of Filipinos. How's your documentary? Still a documentary. You know... I search... I just shoot and shoot. That's what a documentary's like. My discovery, mystery, my struggle, but there's orgasm too. The one on Hanzel, how is it going? I'm in limbo. So much footage. Actually, now I'm more interested in the lives of people like you. How you sift through a case until you see the truth. It's not just the truth that an investigator looks for. What else? Lies too. That's true. We truly have different roles in life... A filmmaker and a detective. Can I invite you to watch my films and documentaries? We'll hook up. Come in. Just a minute. This is my world, man. I'm the custodian of the film department at this school. That's why I have access to all the equipment. All for free. Have a seat. Watch this short film I made. THE SHADOW OF HELENA FROM BEYOND by Taga Timog (Southern Man) SMALL HOUSES IN OUR COUNTRY A documentary by Taga Timog I work in this building, for the son of a millionaire who studies at Columbia University. I work five days a week, and they pay me five hundred dollars. On weekends I stay in their house in Connecticut. They're kind to me. They're good people. I have to go to work now. Bye! I've been here in America for some time now, around seven years. My life's okay. I have a sizeable income. My salary is 500 dollars a week, even though I have no legal papers. I work as a domestic helper on the Upper West Side, in Manhattan. I put my siblings through school, and two of them are even graduating soon. I'm very, very happy. I'm so happy for them. As soon as they finish their studies, I'll be okay. Before I came to America, I went to Saudi Arabia first. Life's difficult there in Saudi. Very difficult... I worked there for three years... For three years, my employer held me prisoner. He took my passport, all my papers. Our embassy ignored me even though I wrote to them. I wrote to them several times, asking for help. Why did he hold you prisoner? The truth is... He got me pregnant. He was my employer, but I was his wife. And my baby... What happened? He killed my baby... Really? When I gave birth... He said the baby was not his. Eventually, he let me go. As long as I don't report what happened. What do you think, man? Come in. I hope you don't mind that it's kind of cold. But I got the place for free. Coffee? - No, don't worry about me. Coconut wine? - No, thanks. My real name is Antonio Pareño. When I came to America... I changed my name. I changed my face. I had plastic surgery done. When I finished at West Point in 1970... I went back to the Philippines. I was immediately assigned as a deep penetration agent at the campuses. I joined the progressive groups. My first victim was Porfirio Dumadag of the University of the East. He was brilliant. Committed activist, campus leader, editor of the university paper... We became friends. We went to rallies. Finally, the order came to get rid of him. I tortured him and buried him alive in Tanay. I killed three more people at the University of the Philippines in 1971. I arrested many more. At the University of Santo Tomas... I tortured, raped, and murdered two women activists. A professor and five students died when I tossed a grenade at an action rally. At the University of Manila... I befriended Andres Soliman, student council president. I lived in his house. I blew his head off in a safehouse in Marikina. Subtitles: Kristine Kintana, Renato Loriga, Ivana Miloš, Alessandra Thiele
