This is my best friend Léa. Léa speaks five languages, cannot stop eating Haribo candy peaches and has cystic fibrosis. Which means that she was born with thick mucus trapped in her lungs and so is hyper susceptible to bacteria that could limit her ability to breathe. It means she takes upwards of twenty digestive pills a day, means she will go to the hospital every three months to test her lung function for the rest of her life. And it means, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation that her life expectancy hovers around 37. On average, for most people. But Léa isn't really most people. She doesn't talk about cystic fibrosis. She refuses to take antibiotics. She almost never does her breathing treatments. Léa smokes. But she's fine. She's more than fine, actually. She's more alive than anyone I've ever met. Léa falls in love every three months, loses her phone every two weeks and works out doing flying trapeze. For my 21st birthday Léa handed me a cake with 21 joints on it. For my 22nd birthday - Léa made me jump off a bridge. And at 23, as we graduated, she convinced me to take a trip. One, she promised, would change my life. In three months, we traveled through an indigenous village in rural Jalisco, a hippie beach town on the Mexican coast, the Peruvian Amazon, and the Atacama Desert in Chile. Léa was sure that in Latin America, there was another way to heal herself and she was ready to find it. And as always I was coming with her. The summer after we graduated from college, Léa tested positive for a dangerous bacteria in her lungs: Pseudomonas. Five years before, according to Léa, a woman in Mexico City had cured her of the same bacteria, using magnets. The only biomagnetist in California, according to Yelp, was in a strip mall in Upland. -Hello. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? Magnets are so cheap and they have been around forever. And it's a shame that people don't know all the things that we can do with magnets. -Do you know what cystic fibrosis is? -Yes. -Right. So I have cystic fibrosis. -Okay. One of the main dangers of the sickness is that you can catch bad bacteria that normal people would eradicate. These are my most powerful magnets. We don't want to waste too much time looking for a spot, right? Right. So, no, it's for sure in the lungs. With basic detox, we do lungs, kidney, pancreas, bladder, ascending and descending colon. And the basic detox addresses the Pseudomonas? Trust me, once you body returns to a pH balance, it won't tolerate any toxins. We're going to give this until four, which is more than one and a half hours. Okay, thank you. Do you think this is really going to work? I mean I don't know, you know... We flew to Mexico City and as we get there, this woman does this. But now this is like my life, and then, she just says, like it's gone. I was like, "Are you sure it's okay?" "I know, I checked, it's gone." And there's no more of it, you know. And then maybe my mom You know, you're just like... Yeah, we like walked out and then came back to L.A. and then did the the test and then it was gone, you know? And like, maybe it's the antibiotics, but for me it was just such a... It was just crazy, you know. And no one, like no one knows about this and like, in moments where you're like close to death like something so important that you're... you're down to just like throw away all your beliefs, there's things that are crazy that happen if you're open to it, but I've no idea if this is true, though. Wow, I can really do feel different. You do, huh? A few days later, Léa's test came back negative for Pseudomonas. And even though we couldn't prove it was the biomagnetism, it was all the evidence she needed. Léa felt like she had found an inexplicable alternative to antibiotics. And by her logic, if that was possible, then the world was full of inexplicable solutions. And she wanted to find one. Or a few. So she made a plan for us. We would start in Mexico City and go south from there going wherever and talking to whoever we needed. She was ready to try anything, essential oils, plant medicines, shamanic ceremonies, horse therapy, and frog poison. It's just that I really want frog poison. Life was easy for me in L.A. I was born into an Iranian Jewish family with an elaborate web of on aunts, uncles, grandparents, sisters and cousins in L.A. who are all quite sure that I did not need to go off to South America hunting a cure for an incurable disease I didn't even have. Actually, after hearing a brief outline of our plan, my mother yelled that I would get kidnapped somewhere in Mexico and then she would get my fingers in the mail, demanding ransom money. She was... fifteen months. I have a very bad memory in general, but that moment is stuck in my mind forever. What were you thinking was going to happen to her? I was thinking that I should... I don't want to speak about this now. Okay, okay. I was thinking... You do it. Come already. I don't want to talk about it now. I mean, we were expecting to see her with more, more issues, you know. Um... But she's Léa, she's Léa and she... thought that... I can't really explain. Especially because it seems like... I mean, she doesn't do her treatments so well. -I know. -Right now. I know she doesn't do it. Well, I don't. I think she's going a little too far. -You think so? -Yeah. Because of you think... like, in what way? I think she's taking too much risk. Sometimes I think that she lives, she acts like if she wasn't sick. That summer, when it was time for Léa's checkup in Brussels I went with her. One, two, three. There you go. That will do. Okay. Do you smoke? Sometimes. Very rarely. So you have a few smokes here and there. This last year, would you say your symptoms have evolved? Yes, I've been coughing a bit more. - Have you taken antibiotics? - No. I hesitated. I thought, since I'd be seeing you full time... You should have taken antibiotics. Sorry. Last time, I tried to make you take antibiotics, just think about it twice a day, morning and evening. You don't do it, and you don't look bad, that's for sure. But what's also true is that, if you get worse, you probably won't notice immediately. The problem I have with antibiotics, it's not due to time, it's... - You're scared of them. - Exactly, just the idea of antibiotics killing bacteria, I just... I know it kills good stuff too, so I wouldn't mind them for a month, but taking them non stop, I just can't. It might sound stupid, but I just can't bring myself to doing it. No, it's not stupid. You're in a much better state than others. You won't live forever, but nothing ever does. No, that's right. Well, lots of people have died before you, but you are taking a risk. With chronic cough, you never know when to expect it. Oh, it's him. Dr. Lubeck warned me about the trip. Léa could lose her pills. She could contract another bacteria. He said cystic fibrosis is vicious. Even if she's fine now, she could suddenly get really sick somewhere remote and there wouldn't be a hospital for me to take her to. The whole thing you have to keep the... you is, it's the... Only the right finger moves, the left one always stays here. And then your turn it. And you lick it. You sit back. And when you blow you just put your head a little bit... I mean, you know that, but... Like, your chin is up. A little bit, like, you know, this is normal. Right there, you know. So you're like a little bit superior. Yeah. And you're kind of normal. And you hold the cigarette like you're bored with it. For bore, yeah, exactly. Bored and then... I know you so well, it's so funny. -You do? -I do. The next day, Léa's aunt told us a rumor about a guy from Brussels with cystic fibrosis whose family flew in shamans from Peru to help with his healing. Clearly, we needed to meet him and after finding him on Facebook, Léa wrote him a message. Hello Antoine, I'm Léa, I also have cystic fibrosis. I would love to meet you to talk about a project on which I'm working right now. So, if you have some time this week or the next, let's go eat or get a drink. I hope to see you soon. He hasn't read it. Well, it's been about five minutes. Should I put a question mark? So why are you afraid to meet him? I just think if someone did that to me, I might think is weird. "Hi also have cystic fibrosis, do you want to meet up and, like, talk about it?" You know, I find it a little bit weird. But maybe, maybe, maybe it will be fine. Léa's doctor warned us. Cystic fibrosis patients are not supposed to meet. The risk of bacterial exchange is too high. But sometimes, there really is no stopping Léa. So you guys are just... - Yeah, it's... - Not gonna... Hello, welcome to my home. No, thank you so much. So, do you mind if I'm filming this? Sure. When you get bad news, how do you react? I generally say, "Okay, what should we do?" - And we do it. - Like, "Cool." What about you? - I say, "Cool." - Really? Yeah. But it's been several years now that I've been saying that and people kept bringing me more bad news. When my body rejected my second transplant, I started losing 10% breathing capacity per week. My doctor told me, "At this rate, in a couple of weeks, that's it. So we're hoping to find lungs on time for you." And I told him, "Cool, sure." Can't do anything about it. You either accept it, or you don't, so you cry, and you'll die faster. After meeting him, we went back to see Antoine a few times that week. Eventually, he told us about the shamans, about Ayahuasca, this psychedelic plant from the Amazon jungle that, supposedly, had the power to heal illnesses, seen and unseen. I had this fear of death I wanted to get rid of. Right. So I tried this Ayahuasca thing. Such a miracle. I had this feeling of serenity peace, and calmness. In like five. You're not ready to talk about it yet? Okay. Don't worry about it. Antoine affected Léa in a way I hadn't seen anyone affected before. He humbled her. And I knew, as soon as he mentioned it that Léa would find a way to try Ayahuasca. Do you trust me? Stay up. The night we arrived in Mexico City we met a shaman in a taco restaurant. A friend of a friend, Michelle, had been a DJ and a marketing executive before she dropped everything to become a healer. Now she travels around Mexico, learning about different traditions and leading healing ceremonies. The next morning she came to talk to us in the apartment. I've seen complete transformations for people have had breathing problems, heart problems, diabetes, you know, esclerosis múltiple, all types of conditions. I have a hard time believing that I can, like... free myself out of this condition like intentionally, although I'm super obviously attracted to the idea, you know. Well, I mean, I tell people, you know, "don't believe anything I say" you know, it's something that you just feel that you're doing the right thing. You know, no matter what. You know, and those are the challenges that our families, a lot of times I say that our families are our greatest teachers. Because they're going to try to do everything so we stay the same and we don't evolve. You know, and so we're here to break off, you know, that system and that pattern, and if we listen to them... I'm sure I was making sense a lot, you know, because they're always telling us, "you need to do this, and this and this is and this." But who says how things should be? So let's say we did want to come see you. Do you think we could? Yeah, definitely. -Yeah? -Sure, that would be really nice. Around midday, Arturo, a shaman in training, arrived with his coordinator, who had a different kind of plan for us. Let's talk, let's talk. The ceremony I would have liked to do first, I would have preferred it to be with peyote. The peyote? It's super lovely. One thing is sure. He removes everything you don't need and brings you closer to what you really need. I... so, it's... trip, inside your body and outside your body with the Mother Earth and you become part of everything. Okay. If you allow me I can take you to heal yourself. Yeah. Yes, yes. I can bet you as much money, if you want. It's genetic, though. But you will heal. You will be fine. You will be fine. So you're saying you would go and say like your sickness is over? -Yes. -Okay. Yes, yes. That's interesting. I give my word to you that in this case you're going to be with the best masters in the world. I'm working with this marakame. In his town, his community, the Wixárika people, the Huichol people, we have like these three important events during the year and one of those events is going to be this weekend. Is La Fiesta Del Maiz. -So if you want, you can, if you... -We can. Yeah, we've got you in. So that is just like... There's no ceremonies there. Yes, there will be. There will be ceremony. The whole weekend! Tomorrow. Tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. Are you going to consider them in? We'll then take them to the mountains. You ready? Western medicine has no cure to cystic fibrosis. The illness is genetic. It would take a rewriting of Léa's DNA to actually get rid of the sickness rather than just address its symptoms. But Arturo told us he was learning an ancient indigenous spiritual tradition from a shaman in a village called San Andrés Cohamiata, two days drive from Mexico City. He promised that the Elder of the village could cure Léa in a sacred ceremony around a fire involving peyote, a psychedelic cactus. They say that when you eat peyote and you are in the ceremony, you can see the blue deer in the fire. You shit in your pants when you see that. You shit on yourself when you see that. Really. Don't be scared. I mean, I... No, I'm not scared... -I don't take it like this, you know? -Yeah. I think it's... No, I... I'm not against, you know... I'm sorry if I may give you the impression that I am very like-- No. You know. Come on, I will... Maybe it's because really I am like that, - Yeah, you are, yeah. - Yeah. Okay, I'm going to tell you -as the way as it's going to be. -Okay. I can assure you and I can bet you that that ceremony, those hours, that moment in your life, will be, probably... the best moment of your life. Here we go. -Good night. -Good night. Do you mind if we film you? We're making a documentary. - No. - No? Just one question? - No. - Okay. Two days, three cars and 600 miles later, passed legitimate narcos and miles of corn fields, we were in San Andrés Cohamiata. The Huicholes or Wixárika are indigenous people that survived Spanish conquest and now preserve their culture in the mountains of Jalisco, where they speak their own language grow their own food and practice their own religion. Traditionally, the Huicholes are the guardians of peyote, or hickory. They use the cactus for everything, from scrapes and bruises to connecting with their gods through the fire. Peyote is actually one of their gods alongside corn and the blue deer. When we arrived we met Julian Arturo's marakame, a shaman of the village and he presented us and the camera to the village and asked if we could film. The next day, at the annual corn celebration Léa would be presented to the Village Elder to be cured. The next morning, we woke up to discover that Arturo had already gone to the party. Do you think we're gonna get there and Arturo is going to be like, super fucked up? Sort of, yeah. I don't know what happened. The thing about spiritual healing is that there's no schedule of events. We weren't sure what time we were meeting the healer where to go, or who to talk to about it. As we wandered around we met Toto and Chris, friends of Julian who are from a beach town four hours west and have been visiting San Andrés for years learning the Huichol traditions. They offered to show us the views outside the village before the celebration and we very gratefully followed them. The Wixáritari culture woke me up. The system prioritizes a lot things that are very material, very banal and we forget about the Spirit. And the Spirit... is the most important because the Spirit has been to many places and it can... guide the heart in a way that makes more sense compared other material things. Without realizing it we had spent over two hours at the waterfall. When we got back to the village, Toto and Chris led us to the party. There, we found Arturo again, who found Julian, who told us that they had been looking for us. We were late. The Elder had left. He was old and tired and so he had gone to bed. Léa would not be healed with peyote or anything else. Not in San Andrés. Honestly, at that time, Léa didn't seem fazed. So neither was I. Instead, we watched the families, played with the kids and ate homemade blue corn tortillas. At one point, a little bit drunk on fermented corn drink Julian suggested I find a Huichol husband. That night, we gathered around the fire and tried to see the blue deer in the flames. In the morning, we said goodbye. We said thank you. Toto and Chris invited us to visit them at the beach one day and we made our way back through the mountains to Mexico City. We left never knowing if the Huicholos could heal Léa but we understood that entering the world of the Huicholos was not as simple as Arturo had made it out to be. Healing, it seems, demands commitment. Toto and Chris had spent nine years walking the path of the Huichol religion and still felt like newcomers. They said they would never fully understand the tradition or its healing. Simply because they were not Huicholos. On the way back, Léa was very quiet. I feel lost. I don't know where to... What I think or what I'm supposed to think or... I am scared. And I'm confused by... I even went like, "what am I doing?" You know, like what we're doing. Like I know it all in my head but I'm like... It's like... I don't know. Silence scares the shit out of me. Silence and like... Nothingness and... and... not like a lack of action, you know. A few days later, we met Lourdes, the original biomagnetist who had cured Léa five years ago, introduced her to alternative medicine and was a major part of the reason we were in Mexico. To me like, the idea that the biomagnetism really works, still I can't bel-- I mean, I believe it because I'm here but it's crazy. Regarding this, I recall an homeopathic doctor who came to see me few years ago and he told me, "I'm not going to tell you what I have. You are going to tell me." - To test? - Yes, to test. Exactly. So, I started with the legs but after two minutes I told him, "you have herpes." He was... He couldn't believe it. Then, I gave him a therapy and he told me, "Lourdes, but the magnets!" - Yes. - "The magnets." I told him, "Yes," I told him, "The magnets are the kings - for viruses." - For viruses? And bacteria as well? Virus, bacteria, fungus and parasite. For instance, if someone has AIDS, not AIDS, before it, the virus of AIDS, because when you have AIDS it already changed. Yeah, I had people with AIDS, With AIDS. And did they get rid of it? - Yes. - All of them? Yes. She said that every patient with AIDS that has come here, she cured them. She's like, "how?" Yes. I ask the permission, if it gives me the permission to search. It told me yes. Is there pseudomonas? Pseudomonas... Is there? - No pseudomonas. - No? I had pseudomonas three weeks ago. Let me ask. Was there pseudomonas? It tells me yes, that you had it. Now, in this moment, do you have pseudomonas? No? Why? Because of the magnets. Point out to me... Some virus, fungus, parasite, bacteria, pathogens. But I can ask more, if you want to. Emotions, spiritual harmony, depression, emotional blocks, spiritual blocks, duda, duda. You have duda. What's duda? Duda? Doubts. Oh! What are your doubts about? You don't know? No. But it's like... Yes, you know. You know. An alumna of... The thing is, I was not convinced that it was magnets that had gotten rid of Léa's bacteria five years ago or in California a few weeks ago. I wasn't even sure Léa really believed it. What did you think? Did you think that you... Didn't have these bacteria? That I what? Like, she said, you know, you didn't have them. I think she, like, took them out. You think she took them out. So you do believe her? Yeah, yeah. No, I always did believe her. I'm just tired, I'm like very... I'm thinking of... The rest of the way back to the apartment Léa did not say one word. I figured she just needed space, so I left her alone. Um... Well, first, like, I think it's like super weird. So, like, I wanted to address that first. I mean, I sound the only one picking it up. I've just been like feeling a bit weird inside and I just... feel like you don't really care. Whenever I noticed that you're... like, you seem to be like in a different mood or you seem not to be completely in it, like I always try to come to you and to ask you and I really fucking care and yeah, there are signs I need help, you know, and it's like, it's just like... It just hurts me when, like... You don't ask if you can help. Sometimes I'm like, "I do really need to explain this?", you know, Do I really need to explain to you like why it's hard for me and like why I need support and like why am I having some freak out sometimes and I know when you mean the questions and I know when you don't, and like something like yesterday, like if you're asking me, "how it was?" and like, if you see I react weirdly, like, come to me, like, "Léa, what's wrong?" You know, like... She was right. I just didn't know how to help her. Léa had never needed me like this before. This trip was forcing us to ask questions of ourselves and each other that maybe we didn't need to ask. And there were things I had never reckoned with and didn't want to. Léa was always pushing things, pushing me and maybe I just wasn't equipped for this. The next day we decided to leave Mexico City and visit Toto and Chris at the beach. Can we? We spent four days following Toto and Chris, going back and forth between the beach and Toto's chocolatería. Before settling in San Pancho, Chris had spent ten years traveling through Mexico in a converted van, which is how he met Toto and ended up on the path of the Huicholos. Actually, but extraordinary coincidence Julian and his family were also visiting San Pancho the same time we were. Our last night with them we asked Chris about his experiences with peyote. Usually medicines, what they do is they open your heart and they accelerate process but it's always like looking within, and facing your fears or the things you have to face and the medicine puts your fear in front of you because that's what you have to work on. So sometimes I feel that a lot of people are afraid of taking medicine because you don't want to face your demons and your fears, you know, but that's what the medicine tells you, it's facing, and when you face it, let go. The next morning somehow there was Michelle, the shaman we had met on our first day. She told us we were ready to do a peyote ceremony with her. According to Michelle, peyote was a gentle spirit, a grandfather, she said. And it was good for everyone and I should drink too. With the permission of Guardians, With the permission of the Great Spirit, with the permission of Mother Earth, I present myself here, Great Spirit In this sacred space that I can work here with my sisters... We spent the whole day preparing for the ceremony that would last till morning. We made an altar and we wrote letters to ourselves and our parents to give to the fire. The ritual felt foreign and a little forced to me. Part of me found it hard to take it all as seriously as Léa was suddenly taking it. But another part of me was bored of analyzing and rationalizing mysticism. I wanted to turn off my brain and for once, just be there. It was harder than I thought. Focus yourself on the fire, you can converse with the fire, everything that you want to share, any questions. The fire is our teacher. It's strange to look inside of you. I'm afraid of emptiness if I detach myself from my own self. What if there's nothing after? I'm afraid of walking towards an unknown place, and end up in a desert on my own. I want to... release myself from... from feeling... so... distant and... far away from what's happening. I want to be... more present and more sincere. As the sun rose I felt different. Lighter. And I didn't know what happened to Léa, but she told me that the peyote ceremony had opened a door for her. It was clear that plant medicines held some kind of answers and she decided it was time to go to Peru and find Ayahuasca. Antoine, Arturo, Chris and Michelle had all talk to us about Ayahuasca, this plant that was supposed to confront you with your worst fears and wounds, strip you of your ego and change you forever. And peyote had shown Léa that she was ready. I didn't understand how or why but after the ceremony I felt close to Léa again. Peru's sacred Valley is 3,000 miles from Mexico City, 4,500 miles from L.A. We felt it. Are you nervous? - You look a little bit nervous. - No, not at all. Antoine had pointed us to Pisac, a town known as the alternative medicine capital of Peru. In our hostel, we stumbled on Harry and Philip. Do you came to Peru especially for ayahuasca or because of the trip in general? -It was just for Ayahuasca. -Okay, wow. -We made no plans for anything else. -Oh shit. And how long were you here for? It was an 11-day retreat, five ceremonies. Five ceremonies. Okay, this is a good opportunity to... I'm going to enjoy this and smoke some cigarettes and just listen to the icaros, you know, the songs. But if you get confident you will turn up the heat. That will come on over and think that... that will make your ego coming away and what it's trying to tell you. Yeah, the purge was so violent, like it... You were throwing up? When I was throwing up it was so violent that it was like, it was like the... you know when you're throwing up and you can still feel it reaching into the stomach. Well, this was reaching back into my organs into my throat, my head, my legs, my guts, just... and it was so like... like I was clenching so hard just getting it all out and it was just, it was like throwing up pure poison. The second ceremony was difficult. I actually got two cups and my mother and father died and I ended up in pain and suffering from illness when I was young and it was making me feel that, and I was just, like, tearing at my top trying to make it stop. I was really uncomfortable. So yeah, I experienced that, but it really affected me physically after the ceremony... I was blind for a day. It took me near enough a day to get my eyesight back. And then that stopped and I just started to shake... Like shake, the whole body rocking. For two hours. And I was shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking... -So now do you feel better? -I feel great. I feel great. For you, before you came here, did you believe in it already, like... Yeah, I was spiritual, yeah, but I had no idea about the power of... Yeah. You know, you can't. You know. It transforms. It will give you a change in some way. But it's not something to be afraid of. I have a genetic sickness that's called cystic fibrosis, -I don't know if you heard of it. -Yeah. It's kind of hard because I don't really know, like... I don't really believe that it can cure me physically in any way. It's nothing that she can't. There is nothing that she can't do? Wow. But I would say the most important thing about the whole process is-- -Oh, it's hail! -Oh, wow. Holy shit. In Pisac, everyone seems to be on a healing journey of some kind. But it was hard to tell what was genuine and what was an act, what was really healing and what was a product to buy or an excuse to get high with strangers. Before we left, I thought that I was here to like find out about plants that could cure me and in the beginning we met Arturo who was like, "Oh, I'll cure you." And all my life, when people were talking about healing it was always physical, it was always like, "Okay, did you do this treatment? Did you do that treatment?" It's always just like mechanical and physical. I know that it has impacted me like psychologically, and like maybe spiritually, I don't know what that means, but... And yeah, to understand like what... what I really want and not like what I think is like... Is like... I should want given circumstances, you know. Everyone keeps asking about Ayahuasca, like everyone from home. Like there's a way where all the stuff is like, so commercialized and made so touristy, like super weird. And also I don't know if I wanna do it, like in general, which we've talked about but like I just... I'm afraid. I'm like really pretty deeply afraid. -Do you want to talk of what I think? -Yeah. Tell me what you think. The moments where, like, I see you happy, are the moments where you follow your instinct. You know when you tell me like, "Oh, yeah, like you changed me or whatever." I don't really think so, I just think like you don't trust yourself enough that, like your instincts is like good. I personally, like saw a big change from like in the first week, very honestly. If you don't feel like something is right, like don't do it, but not if it's someone else fears though. You know, if it's your actual own fears, then maybe you shouldn't do it. You're like, "Ayahuasca, I feel it's not right for me" then don't do it. If you feel like, "Oh, my mom wouldn't want me to do it, then do it, you know... Oh man, but it's hard to tell. I know. Oh man. I don't know. ...it's too commercial. And we don't want it to... we don't want it to be an experience... a commercial experience, you know. Therefore, it's interesting to see but I believe that we'd prefer to go to an authentic place, you know... Oh! Okay. So basically she gave me the name of these people that are in Pucallpa which is in the middle of the selva, near Iquitos. And then I'm like, "Oh, I mean, then like, where?" You know, they are in Pucallpa and she said, "Yeah" and so I'm, "Should we just go to Pucallpa?" And she said, "Yeah". So she's like, "Tell them that you, like... that you did hikuri with Michelle Beton because they're, like, they know her because they're like... -Yeah. -As real as her, as like ancient as her... So I think... I mean... -We should go there like, three days. -Are we going to meet her? And she was like, "You guys should stay a week." Okay. So that's what... -My mom is going to have a panic attack. -Yeah. And... So she's like, "everyone that I've talked to who went there and did this one, came back changed." So okay, let's go. It's so scary. Pucallpa is where she's from. Pucallpa is where, like you know, the Huicholos for hickory, like ...like the ones for Ayahuasca, they come from there. Okay. You know, here, they don't come from here at all. Ahi, ahi, ahi. Mosquitoes in the jungle. It says... Okay, it says that it's usually to address physical illness, strengthen the immune system specific organs or to connect the spirit of the plants. I wonder if they actually would claim that they can heal you. It's just saying we're alone in our house, for most of the time doing spiritual, mental and other works. And then it offers the chance to reconnect to the forest and the spirit and spend time alone with yourself and your fears. It can be used as a, quote, "reset button on your life." If you're willing to step outside your comfort zone and encounter the magic that lies outside of it. That's all fine because I do have another meager lung. Do you think those people are good? Yeah, it seems really... what we need. Somewhere along the line I realized I was about to do ayahuasca, six times, in ten days. And for once, it wasn't a calculated choice. It was just what was next. It was a step in the process I had started a long time ago. I've started by stepping foot in Peru, by picking up the camera, by choosing Léa. I had brought myself here. And of course as soon as I realized this, I started freaking out. We're going to the Jungle tomorrow. What jungle? We're doing like a ten day retreat thing. What is this? What is this? It's like an Ayahuasca thing. How are you getting there? We're flying there and they pick us up from the airport. Flying? What was the name again? Iquitos. Iquitos. Okay. Ten days? I think this is a lot. Yeah, it's a long time, I know. So you are sure this place is safe? Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's safe. It's like a known place. And there is a website, I'll send you it now. -Yeah. -Yeah. Be careful. Watch each other, watch her, watch yourself. Don't eat anything bad. Don't do anything weird. I'll try my best. -Okay. -Okay. I love you. -Bye. -Bye dad. Ayahuasca is a medicine of our culture that in the past we used, when, in the past, it was the scientific medicine... they were very far and they took Ayahuasca and they would cure themselves with it, in the past, the first men, women and kids. Ayahuasca is not something to be afraid of. Because Ayahuasca cures all kinds of illnesses. In general, it cures our psychological traumas, traumas of our-- of our dad, of our mom, of our siblings. Suicides, traumas... it cures our body, our digestive organs, and our head. Diabetes, AIDS, prostate, migraine, body's pain, shoulder's pain, joints... In general, right? General illnesses. Only two things happen in the world since the humankind. They are blocks and psychological traumas. Right? Nothing more. When you take Ayahuasca, you have to have in mind only one idea. Right? The idea of your intention: I will see my body. I want to to look at my body. I want to look at my body. I want to look at my stomach. I want to look at my trauma. I want, this way. Many people say that Ayahuasca is a drug but it's not a drug. It's medicine. Pure medicine. Many times I say, if Ayahuasca was a drug, Ricardo would be crazy. Ricardo would have a trauma. Ricardo would be about to fall to the ground. Right? It's killing himself. Right? Ricardo is going to die because he takes a lot of Ayahuasca. Right? No. Ricardo lives, Ricardo is strong. So what we what are we doing right now? I didn't understand. This is what we call the vomitivo. -The vomitivo, okay. -Yeah, the vomitive. -Oh, to throw up, okay. -Yeah, exactly. So we're meant to-- we're meant to vomit right now. Yes, that's the purpose of it. I'm just checking. ...takes 20 minutes. If peyote is the Spirit of the Grandfather than Ayahuasca is the Mother, unconditionally loving and unforgivably demanding. Out of respect to her, you're asked to adhere to a strict dieta. Firstly, the vomitivo, to cleanse your body. Then a strict diet of grilled whole fish, plantains and quinoa. No sugar, no dairy no meat and no salt. And after that, a master plant different for everyone and chosen for you by the shaman alongside Ayahuasca to help you through the process. I don't know if it's something that could be done with this drink. And... there is no cure. To clean your illness... To clean the block of your emotions - How many days? - Ten days. Ten days. - We can use Piñon Blanco. - Piñon Blanco? Thank you. We're going to help you. - It's certain. - Thank you. Thank you. What's your experience, like physically, emotionally and structurally? I'm a lot more... negative than I want to be. Like I find myself like... always finding the dark side of the situation rather than the nice one. And I think that that is like very linked to spiritually how I feel, which is afraid all the time. The block of her faith, the block of her people... Piñon Blanco as well. We're going to change it to her. - What's your name? - Léa. Léa, we're going to change your plant. Your case is a bit worse. Okay. She's going to have Piñon Blanco because she's more... - She's healthier. - Okay. Six Piñon Blanco? Six times to get rid of this illness. Okay. You have to drink it every day except tonight. Okay. There are things that doctors can't do. But the plants can. Cheers. I'm so curious now. -A bit scared. -Yeah? Léa! We were like, what about... Hello. Good morning. -Good morning. -Good morning. Happy birthday. Oh, yeah. We're going to miss breakfast though, if we don't... Okay, let's go. Oh my God, this is so crazy. -It was crazy, you know? -Yeah. It taught me the biggest lesson in my life, -What? Really? -Yeah. What lesson? It taught me that, like... At the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge, like the most drug thing you can do, I have no idea of like, why we're here, like what we're doing, like what I'm supposed to do and then I just felt like a kid. Also I definitely talked to something. -Really? -Oh, for sure. Really, one hundred percent. I was talking to... to her, which was super crazy. To who? To Mother Ayahuasca. Me too, I was saying-- - Right? - Yes, I was... I was trying to be very respectful. Yeah. Yeah. - Did you have visions? - Yeah. - That's why I felt in control. - No. - I didn't have visions. - Not... I was just thinking about... trying to be in control, but... very much aware... in the beginning it was very confused to me, - I can't really remember the beginning... - I though I was going to lose it. I know it's the strongest part but I was like... ...awareness. I was really like. I felt like the most myself. Yeah, I don't know. I was just kind of trying to get a hold of what was going on. - You probably miss your family. - Yeah. I miss them too. It's like hard, we're like... we're so far. Like in all sense of the term, you know. Give it some time. I will always be there for you. Like in a real way. Whatever you do and whatever happens to you and... Some more? It's good. It's just going to be fine, really. I like, saw Mother Ayahuasca for the first time and it was like... really overwhelming and like really really beautiful. And I was like flattened on the mat, like in so much awe. And like just felt so... crazy and amazing and felt like faith restored pretty like directly and immediately. Okay, let's let it dry on us. There's a part of me actually that, when I'm in ceremony, I'm convinced like it's real like as real as the physical world to something we can't tap into. You know what I mean? Like that you know, you see Mother Ayahuasca and then the vision that she... the jump of like she's actually there, like it's not just a metaphor. You know that your brain is conjuring up, Like, I don't know, what do you think of this? For me, what I've come to for myself is that it doesn't matter. -Right. -It doesn't matter if they're real or not. -What matters is the results -Yeah. and the results are real. The shamans are taking their awareness and their consciousness down to the molecular level with their icaros. They're working on the level of the DNA. That's a great theory, I'm not rejecting it, but... -there's like, there's no case, -Right. you know, that just shows that that has happened. If I go back and I don't smoke and I do the treatment that I already have that exists that already to me is, I mean, it is a complete game changer. During the last ceremony I heard Léa crying in a way I had never heard before. I thought myself out of my own vision, and I softly yelled across the room. I love you Léa. I just didn't hear an answer. I collapsed onto my mind and considered just retreating back into the inside of my head that I was so certain she had to hear me. So I got up again. I love you Léa. and then I heard, "I love you too." Good morning! It's a documentary about dying young. I can't really talk about it. Would you like tomorrow? Second smoker. You like to film me, don't you? I mean, yeah, I know, I... I just like, I just wanted it to be different you know, than like what it was. I was like, I just don't... want to be there but it's so funny saying you always learning. The question I asked was, "Why am I here?" And I really think I'm here to help you. Like I really really think so. That is so funny. I really is like, "Oh!" like... And so I wanted to tell you. Oh my God. Basically, like, that... That like you can, you can chill. You can relax. That it's like you and I really try to take care of you. What were you thinking about? Sickness. The sickness? In what way? It's like the-- It's funny because the first night I was like, "Oh, I feel so normal." You know? Like I just feel normal like everything's fine like, "What the fuck am I worrying." And the second night I was like, I'm not normal. You know, and like... And just like... There's like a lot of the... Over the... I just brought back like a lot of like childhood feelings, you know... like, feeling this way... Like just... I keep feeling like different, you know, and like... I just realized that... it was hard. So that, like... whatever, like whatever this is going to do and like... There's going to help or not, like I don't know. It's just like something that I'm going to have to deal with. And I do think, like... the reason that I don't do it, the treatments and... I just feel that, like, you know it's just, I... It reminds me, you know. And I just don't know. No. There wasn't a lot of time to deal with what had happened. We're in a kind of shock, beginning to process this huge download we had just received but somehow we also had to get across Peru and into Chile to meet a friend in the Atacama Desert, the driest place in the world. What did this make you think about your illness? I actually think that... the sickness is not something that I meant to get rid of. I think the reason that, like during Ayahuasca, I didn't try and go and change it is because it just really to me feels like something that I need to work with. Do you feel like there is a problem though or there was one when we started? Definitely, definitely. I mean, I feel the problem was that, like I didn't... I didn't acknowledge that it existed. It's something that I need to work on. It's like something I need to to take care of Like I need to take care of myself and take care of my body, like treated with respect, with care and be thankful. Like that's enough for now. Until he decides he's full and flies away. I don't know how long will take. But I want him to feel happy. And to fly like freely, "Oh, I'm full, finally." It's not easy, but try breathing slowly and that should work. See this? We've bought five of them-- Really? The only thing my mom needs to know is if it's above 100, it's okay, and she's happy. She still had cystic fibrosis, but she was fine. No bacteria and an above average lung capacity. Maybe even better than mine. One, two, three. They say that the real ceremony begins when you leave Ayahuasca. You come back to your life and everything is actually exactly the same. You are just different. And I was different. There was no way I was staying in Los Angeles. Things change when you realize that under the right circumstances, you can talk to a plant. Léa is also different. She hasn't lost her phone yet. She's been in love with one guy. And she does her breathing treatments. And even though she doesn't smoke anymore every once in a while, she steals a drag of my cigarette.
