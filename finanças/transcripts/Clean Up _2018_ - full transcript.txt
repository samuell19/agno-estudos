Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy. Mommy, Mommy! Mommy! CLEAN UP Five months is pretty late. For now, I'll prescribe medication and hormone therapy, okay? I'm not planning on getting pregnant. Well, even if you aren't, I think, not only mothers, but all women should get treatment. Premature menopause is a treatable condition. It's not even a disease. And you're still young. Captain! I need to talk to you. How'd you even find me here? Did you tell her? I heard you snitched to the boss. Well? Jong-hee. We had to cover for you 10 times this month alone. I don't need to snitch for them to find that out. I got injured! How can I work? I'm about to turn full-time. Can't you turn a blind eye? I can't. Just a few more days! Please. Go. Go where? Don't push me! You can't tell me what to do! Come on! Screw you! - Let go of me! - Who do you think you are? What's wrong with you? You son of a bitch! Don't just watch. Help. Let go! What am I gonna do now? They've already got my replacement. Do you know who it is? An ex-con. Ex-con? A criminal. Why would they fire you to bring in someone like that? They get government support. They'll take any trash if it means extra cash. Assholes. Jung-ju, will you talk to the boss and ask him to keep me on? You know he likes you. Please? Just this once? How can I? I was the one who got you this job. Can't you help me out? Jung-ju. You did good work today. Thank you. Jung-ju. Would you be interested in dating? This good friend of mine. He came here a few times and thought you were nice. No thanks. Don't be like that. Meet him. He's really nice. Nowadays, people don't care about divorce and such. Plus, you don't have a kid, so that's good. What's so good about it? I'm going home. Hey, boss. We're eating. Oh, he's coming here now? Yeah. All right, sure. Okay, okay. Who's coming? The new recruit. He got out today, and he's coming straight here. Why would the boss recruit someone like that? Even kicking Jong-hee out. He met him at a job fair for ex-offenders. Heard he had two convictions. For what? How would I know? We just wanna be careful. Then ask him when he gets here. Okay? Ex-cons are scary. You should take him to church. Why me? So he can repent for what he did. You're all about Jesus. How old are you? 21. Ah, 21. Seung-hun, go to the van and grab a uniform for him. Oh, Jung-ju. Come here. Are you okay? Get to work. This is our new recruit. Come here. What's your name again? LEE Min-gu. I have to finish with the trash outside. Can you take him around and show him the ropes? Me? Yeah, do me this favor. When I heard ex-con, I thought he'd be a grown up. Chan-suk, can you show him what to do for me? He's a kid, but he's still scary. He scares you too? No, I'm just not feeling well. Okay. Let me finish this. I'll do it for you. Do the next ones too, okay? Mop all the way to the end slowly. Oh, Jung-ju. Finished already? No. I need to check something. She's not a regular employee, but she's been with us for a while. Resume ID LEE Min-gu Were there complaints? About him being an ex-con? What? Chan-suk said something about it this morning. Oh, no. If anything, I can fire him, Job Fair for Inmates Due to Be Released but he said he'd do his best. Job Fair for Inmates Due to Be Released So let's give him a chance. Have you contacted them yet? I'm going to. I had to pull strings to get it. You go on in. When did you get out? Today. Sorry. I wanted to go see you. Has it been a year already? Is it okay if I crash here for a while? No. You saw my girl just now. I'll sleep in the kitchen. We can't all fit in a studio apartment. You have a separate kitchen. Then lend me some cash. Sorry, I'm broke. She pays the rent. If you have nowhere to go, try Chang-ho. $5 He's not out yet. Oh and here. You left this here. See ya. Real Estate Agency Looking for a room? What's the cheapest you have? I just listed a semi-basement room. $3,000 deposit with $400 rent. That's the cheapest? If you want cheap, you gotta put in more deposit. Come back later. Where's Mommy and Daddy? You're not going to draw us? Sure, I am. Really? - This is also red. - Yeah. You said it's a golden country. Fruits are in red. - Is Daddy laughing? - Yes. Welcome. This is crazy. Come on. Outside. I told you we have to meet outside. Why'd you come here? You should leave. Now! Aren't you about to close? All right. Say what you've come to say and go. I met him. Who? Min-gu. Min-gu? LEE Min-gu. From 12 years ago. He was recruited into our company. Are you sure? This isn't something in your head, is it? I'm sure. The kid we kidnapped. Hey, that was 12 years ago. How can you even recognize him? I'm certain it's him. The red birth mark on his neck. And his name is still LEE Min-gu. I checked his resume and ID too. Did he recognize you? He never saw my face back then, but he might know my voice. You're not plotting something, are you? What do you mean? Don't get too close. You could get caught. Caught doing what? Who knows? You might say something. Are you crazy? Why would I say anything? You're weird like that. Weird like how? I'm really curious. Why did you come to tell me this? Are you holding me responsible? I don't know. I just felt like you should know. Know what? It's over. And we don't have anything to worry about. What do you mean? The statute of limitations has passed. We're no longer accountable. It's all over. Statute of limitations isn't the problem. Then what is the problem? Did we stab him with a knife? Did we kill him? We returned him unscathed. So what's the problem? I got it. It's over. Period. There's no need to discuss it further. Stop the car. Why? We're here. Stop. Hey. Hey! Ju-hwan's Dad Hello? Darling. Everyone's asleep. What're you doing? Let me call you back. Hello. Are you crazy? Why are you calling me? I thought about it. Okay? Are you drinking again? I thought about it, and... Okay. What's it about? We have nothing to worry about like you said, right? You called just to tell me that? I'm trying. I've repented. I confessed to God and received forgiveness. You saw me. I really prayed hard and served my penance. Am I being weird now? Jung-ju, let's talk about this later. Tell me. You have repented, and you have been forgiven. Okay? Okay. I gotta wake up early. You go to bed. Yeah. And... Never mind. What? Don't call me darling. We're divorced. We're not family. Okay. Don't come find me or call me either. It brings back memories, and that's hard for me. I am forgiven. I have no sin. I have forgotten all. I don't know you. I am forgiven. I have no sin. I don't know you. I am forgiven. Are you feeling better? Yeah. You left work sick, so why did you drink so much? Where's the new kid? I don't know. He's not here. Are you gonna be okay? Why? Today is a tough gig, so I'm just worried about you. You're hungover. I don't want you to throw up. Get in the front seat. Okay. You are late already? And making us pick you up? Hello. Put on your seat belt. You take care of cleaning up. I'll handle the chemicals. I'll open the door. Let's go. Okay. They found him after two months. Lucky he saved us some trouble by dying in the bathroom. What a fuss. Hello. I'm trying to reach Jang Yu-jin's son. Yes. We've been calling since early this year, but no one answered. This is Yunjee Memorial Park Cemetery. Why are you calling me? The 10-year short-term storage for your mother's remains has expired. We need to know if you're going to renew. Oh. Has it been that long already? Yes, it's three months overdue. Hello? How much is the renewal? Permanent? Or 10 years as before? We have one year too. What do I do with the maggots? What should I do? Do I sweep them up with a broom or use a vacuum? I asked you what to do. Goddammit! Don't you hear me? Don't you hear me talking to you? Have you lost your mind? Come on out! Outside. Are you ignoring me because I've been to prison? I'm trying my best. Out, out, out! Are you okay? Get out. What's going on? Jung-ju, are you all right? I'm fine. - I'll handle it, Captain. - You be quiet. Stand up straight. Where do you get off yelling at that woman? You should have some tact, especially considering your position. Should I call the boss? Do you act like this to your parents? You little shit. I don't have any. What? I'm an orphan. Are you boasting right now? Let me handle it from here. Go inside. It's all right. Smoke. I'm sorry for hitting you earlier. I'm sorry, but still, you shouldn't have done that in there. If you've done wrong, you should apologize. Go find her and tell her you're sorry. Okay? Okay. Smoke. Jung-ju. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry. Captain, I'll get out here. Why? - I gotta go. - Hey. That rude little shit. Actually, I'll also get out here. Really? I've got something to do nearby. Good work today. See you tomorrow. The door is closing. Part Time Night Jobs Eat slowly. Oh, you're here. - Let's start the meeting. - Okay. Well, what can I say? We have a scheduling conflict. Two of you have to go to Incheon to clean a house. Jung-ju and Chan-suk can take the van. No, I think it's best the newbie go today. He needs to learn house cleaning. But we need him to finish yesterday's work. There's a lot of furniture to move. He can join you right after he finishes the house. Okay. Which one of you... Chan-suk, you want to go? Okay. I'll go. Great. It's urgent, so leave right away. Boss, I will go. Really, I'll do it. No, I will. Okay then. Well, have a good day out there. He said it's urgent. You two head out now. - How's it coming? - Good. This detergent has abrasives, so use it to clean places like this. If you lift this up, you'll see the drain. Clean in there too. Spray more. That's it. Now try cleaning. No need to change. We need to join the others. I'm gonna stop off somewhere before I join. Where? I wanna meet someone since I'm here. Get in. I'll drive you. No. You go on. We finished early, so we got time. And you don't know your way around. Min-gu. Why were you in jail? Why? Did they want you to ask me? No, I'm just curious. I used to steal bikes and sell them. They lock you up for stuff like that? I got caught while on probation. Why did you do it? I had nowhere to live and no money. People gotta eat. Why'd you turn off the engine? I'll wait for you here. Go on. You can go. I'll join you soon. It's okay. You should go. Hello, Chan-suk? It's taking us longer than expected, so we're gonna be late. I'm sorry. Yeah, we're still working on it. We'll finish as soon as possible. Can you just keep it a while? I can pay the one-year renewal fee in a month. The manager said no, and this only pays the overdue. If I'd known you'd just kick her out, I wouldn't have come. I saw you have a lot of empty spaces. An empty space doesn't mean you can put somebody there. And we didn't charge you 5 years' worth of management fees. We've already done a lot for you. I just need one more month. Please. I'm sorry. I have to do what I've been told. How did your mother pass away? I don't know. I don't remember. How do you not remember? I'm tired. I need to get some sleep. Was it an accident? Why do you keep asking me? Just tell me. Come on. It was cancer. All right? Did she get an operation? No. Why not? Not enough money? They had money. I was... Back then, someone... They had to give the money away. She died because of me. After she passed, Dad killed himself a few years later. She didn't die because of you. What? It wasn't... your fault. What do you know? I don't know what happened, but it wasn't your fault. It wasn't your fault, so don't blame yourself. Okay? Jung-ju. Jung-ju. Wake up, will you? Favorites Ju-hwan's Dad - Look, you need to cut it out. - Honey, honey. - You're out of line. - Hello? Is this Jung-ju's husband's phone? Who is this? I'm her coworker. I'm sorry. I'll hang up.- Hello? Hello? Fall, with Ju-hwan Hey, you're here! I'm all healed. I was gonna call you. Did you talk to the boss? I really need to concentrate. Okay. Sure. You miss Ju-hwan, don't you? I said leave me alone! All right, all right. If you pray, - Ju-hwan will always be with God... - Jong-hee! Did you not understand me? I told you to leave. Right? Ju-hwan's been dead a long time! So why are you talking about him? I got it. You awake? I was just gonna take a nap and leave. Sorry. It's all right. You brought me home. Come eat. Where's your son? It's not the summer holidays. He died. Five years ago. He was born with a heart condition. He got an operation when he was little, but it didn't work. So he suffered and died. Do you miss him? Of course. He's my son. Min-gu? Yes? You don't have a place to live, do you? I'm rooming with a friend. Don't lie. Do you want to stay at my house for a bit? Why? I'm worried about you. What about the urn? Are you gonna keep carrying it around? I can't stay with you. It's weird. Why? Because I've only known you for a few days. And I don't want you to pity me. Did you finish late last night? The customer was very picky. Did Captain complain again? What'd you two do afterwards? We both went home. Really? No, I'm hungry too. Hey! You son of a bitch! The door is opening. What's wrong? Will you go in first? Ma'am? Yeah? I have to quit after today. Why? Is it because of the pay? Do you want a raise? I'm not quitting because of the money. Then what is it? Because of my son. I feel like we're not spending enough time together. You have a son? Gone to work. Take a shower and get some rest. Dongnam Psychiatric Clinic Patient: LEE Jung-ju Goodbye. Why are you here? Why? What do you mean, why? Is that all you can say to me? I'm working so say what you want and go. Hey, come here. You surprised me. I heard that a young man called me, but I had my doubts. Are you crazy? Or... Is it because you feel guilty? Tae-gyu. His mother died. The money was for her operation. I'm going nuts here. We killed his mom. We ruined his life. Jung-ju, we spent that money on Ju-hwan's operation. We turned him into an orphan. His father killed himself. That woman had no hope. She had stage 4 ovarian cancer. An operation wouldn't have saved her. What? You thought I grabbed some random kid from the street? You knew his mother? Yes. I did. I heard the nurses talking. She had the money for an operation. Shit, after I heard that, all I could see was the money. Why did you do that? Why? Because I didn't want you to struggle, that's why! Now, you're making me the bad guy? After laughing about this together? What're you talking about? When did I laugh? You did. You laughed. Jung-ju. I understand where you're coming from, but what you're trying to do isn't easy. It's not something you can easily get. Not in a million years. Not in a million years. Darling. Yeah? Is it all over now? It's over. It's all over now. You're back. It's late. What's wrong? Don't do that. Really. Don't do that. What's wrong? Don't do that. Stop. What's the matter? Don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for laughing then. When? I'm sorry. Have you ever thought about going to college? Why college? You're too young to be a cleaner for the rest of your life. You're capable of much more. I can pay the tuition. No thanks. I'm sorry. It's $80. Where are you? I'm on my way. Have you eaten? Can you make seaweed soup? Seaweed soup? Yeah. It's been a while since I had that. All right. I'll make it. Hold on. It's almost done. Let's eat. Ju-hwan's Dad Add to Contacts New Friends 2 Year Business Anniversary The Bread Pantry Min-gu? I'll come back for you if you tell anyone. KIM Ju-hwan I'll be right back. What did you play? What did you play today? Jung-ju. Why are you always late? I'm sorry. You're not a regular employee yet. You seem distracted lately. There's a new job. It's cleaning up blood from a murder scene. We need two people. Send Min-gu. He needs to learn. And partner him with Jung-ju. No. You two can cozy up together and take your time like last time. I don't like cleaning up blood. You go. You two seem to be hitting it off. I don't wanna go either. Why? Because I don't. But why? I don't like the sight of blood. Who does? Stop it, guys. Jung-ju, it's not your first time. What's with the attitude? I'll join you after I finish cleaning the storage room. It's settled then. Don't touch anything else. Just wipe up the blood. Okay. Why were you so nice to me? Why can't you talk? I know everything. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You did it not because you're sorry, but because you wanted peace of mind. That's not true. It is. It's not. Don't lie. Don't lie to me. Treating me nicely is worse than kidnapping me then. You're doing this for you rather than for me. Admit it. You wanted to have peace of mind, right? Yes. I wanted to find peace. Do you know how hard it is to live with a sin? It was as difficult for me as it was for you. Difficult for you? Don't. I'll do it. Let me.
