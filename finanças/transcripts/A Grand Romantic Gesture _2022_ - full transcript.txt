[whimsical classical music] I fell in love. [makes gunshot sound] I heard him before I saw him. [man] To be or not to be: That is the question. Whether it is nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them? To die... To sleep, no more. Uh, to sleep more... Um, um-- By a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep. To sleep. Perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death what dreams may-- -Oh, I'm sorry, I-- -I'm sorry, I was just, um-- I was rehearsing, I-- I-- I was just looking for Room-- -[bell rings] -Yeah, I think it's-- It's probably down the corridor. -Sorry. -Sorry. Now, blend it gently. Ah, yes, lovely. -You've got this. -Mm-hmm. [loud clacking] Gently! We must treat our ingredients with love. I am in desperate need of a volunteer. Uh, this is my class. You can't just-- If I don't get one person to transfer-- You know we get paid by the number of students, -you little shit-- -I will be forced to cancel our class. Please, someone, someone, anyone, anyone? -Does it involve cooking? -There's no cooking. [Ava] Sorry. What-- What kind of a class is it? I should have asked, but what could be more boring-- -It's a workshop. -Ooh, work, I like the sound of that. -What kind of a workshop? -Drama. I hate drama. [students chattering] [chattering stops] I found one. Let's give a round of applause to our savior! Yeah! [students whistle] Classes will be three evenings a week. Oh, uh, well, you see, I-- I can't. That's too much, because I-- I know it's the same as the cooking class. Don't worry, we're-- we're not even going to do a whole play. We're just going to workshop some scenes. Work. Yes, see that's where-- [Dylan] From Romeo and Juliet. And you would be perfect to play the part of the nur-- Wouldn't she be perfect for the nurse? It doesn't sound like a compliment. Sor-- I'm Dylan, by the way. -What was your name? -Fuck. Eh? Oh, Ava. -Ava. -Ava. You won't regret this, Ava. Oh, thank you so much! You-- You've made all my dreams come true! -Oh! -Oh! [clapping] It's gonna be great. Let's take a bow. What the fuck? [whimsical music, birds chirping] Uh, I'm Simon. I think we have a scene together. I, um, uh-- I-- I play the priest. Uh-huh, nurse and priest. I guess our Hamlet days are behind us. I feel like I-- This-- this was my wife's idea. I-- I think she just wants me out of the house more. Yeah. Husband and daughter. "Gourmet cooking, you'll love it!" All that stirring and for what? A snack. Ros insisted there would be auditions. I, uh-- I-- I-- I-- I played Hamlet at college. I-- I still roughly remember the big bits from my brief moment of triumph. At least you had one-- triumphant moment. Well, I guess we can't really drop out now, can we? All those disappointed kiddies? At least we're needed for something. So, um, well, I guess I'll see you on Wednesday. Yeah. Yes. I-- see you. You spend those early years of marriage wondering if it'll take. You know, will he meet someone else, so irresistible, sexy, and fun, or wise and warm, that... hot Earth mother that they all seem to long for. But you make it through the rapids, you relax. You see the finish line and then boom! [scoffs] A woman no better than me. It's like being run over by a tricycle and left for dead. [whimsical music] Ah! Shit! Get off! You little fucker! Come here! -[glass shattering] -Ah! Oh... Oops. [grunting] [screaming] Oh, hi. How'd it go? No auditions. Hardly anyone turned up. Well, great, so you got in, then. It was probably a mistake. Well, don't quit. I am just loving my pottery class. What do you think of my first assignment? Look crooked? Maybe a touch? Well, you know what they say. If something's worth doing, it's worth doing proudly. Hey, I'm sure you will enjoy your drama class once you get into it. What is it? Romeo and Juliet. Oh, that's a killer. -What'd you get? -Uh, I'm playing the priest. Oh, aren't you a lucky boy. I got to, uh-- I got to go read the play. -Romeo and Juliet. -Mm-hmm. Would've thought you'd be reading a cookbook. Do people read cookbooks for fun? I'm-- Is that a real thing? Well, if they want to cook, yeah. Um... about the cooking course... Mm-hmm. I might... ... stop. Ava, we did talk about this. -Oh, didn't we? -[Matthew sighing] Look, I know the job situation isn't fair. Fair? They ripped the life out from under me. Change is hard at first. -Oh... -But then you learn to adjust. We're doing a lot better than most people. My job's going great. We have to cut back on a few things. Vacations. Might have to move into a condo. But now that Deborah's all grown up and married, -we're going to be fine. -It's not just about the money. How would you feel if you lost your job and your career? Well, not great, obviously, but I try to look at the bright side. Look at all the new things opening up for you. Hobbies, afternoon naps, new friends. Soon you'll be going out for coffee with the gals and trading cookie recipes. Don't quit this class, Ava. Plus, I was looking forward to having an actual meal. Ha. -Well, good night. -Uh, night. [whispering] Thank you. [sighing] [doorbell rings] [thumping on door] [doorbell and thumping continue] [Debra] Mom? Mom? Mom. Mom. We could have been murdered. They took everything, even our phones. We had to go next door to call the cops. [Ava] Oh, my God. Sit down, sit down. Sit. Sit. We were asleep in the next room when it happened. I got up to pee and I was like, "Where's our TV?" They-- They-- They were robbed. -While we were sleeping! -Oh, darling. This is the last time I live in an affordable neighborhood. Is it okay if we stay here for a few days? Yes, of course it is. You call the insurance company yet? -Insurance? -Oh, I feel faint. Are there any nice treats from your gourmet cooking class? Oh, that sounds yummy. Oh, um, no. Oh, toast! I'll make something like that... You're about to become a father and you don't have insurance? But on the bright side, we could be dead. And enter. If I profane with my... ... unworthiest hand... ... the-- the holy shrine, the gentle sin is this. My lips, two blushing pilgrims, do stand ready to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. Uh, good pilgrim. You do wrong your hand too much. Which mannerly devotion shows is this? For saints have hands. Pilgrims' hands do touch. And palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss. -Okay, stop, stop. Stop. -What? They just-- They don't need to be quite so close together. Well, I think they would be. Yeah, I think so too, man. -Totally. -Yeah. Well, it's called blocking and the director is in charge of it. So, uh, we're going to need a lot more distance. I-- I don't think so. It's more powerful if the passion is implied. But-- But I can't feel the passion from, like, right here. You know, like... Well, here, I definitely feel it. Yeah, yeah, I can feel it, too. That's great. Okay, well, we're just going to take five, everyone. Tom, you can review the material over there, real quick. And, um, just have a word-- [low voice] What are you doing? You are my girlfriend. [Michelle] You said that wasn't why I got the part. [Dylan] Well, it's not, but you were all over him. [Michelle] Uh, it's called acting. [louder] Well, it didn't look like acting to me. Which means it was good acting. Come on, Juliet is not a slut. Well, I mean, she kinda is. She kisses him, like, the minute she meets him. What are you talking about? She's 13 and smitten. Okay? You know what? Maybe I nee-- Maybe I need someone younger, someone-- You can't have a 13-year-old. -You'd be arrested. -Well, okay, fine. Then maybe I need someone older, someone who's not gonna be... Yeah, that's it. Yes. I need to totally re-conceive the whole play. That is what people do with Shakespeare! Audiences don't want the same old, same old. Then Shakespeare gets all the credit. I should be getting the credit. I'm the artist here. -You. -[Simon snores] And you. Hi. Guys. -[claps] -[Simon snores] -Hello? -[Dylan claps] Hi. Yes. You are my new Romeo and Juliet. -[Michelle and Tom] What? -Yeah! Come on. It's original. It's unexpected. It's hilarious. It's comedy -[whispering indistinctly] -and tragedy coming together. I mean, what could be better than that? We're living in a post-genre world, right? Okay, uh, Tom, take a seat. Thanks. You guys do the same passage as Michelle and Tom were just doing. Let's go. Come on. Where Romeo and Juliet first meet. Uh, top of page 80. [Simon clears his throat] -Ready? -Yeah. If I profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims. Ready stand to smooth that rough touch-- -I-- -with a tender kiss. Look, I-- I don't-- so-- sorry. -I don't remember being young. -It's fine. Just read it. Come on, how hard is that? Guys, am I the only one trying here? [Michelle laughs] Okay. Um... -[whispering] What? -Good pilgrim. Okay, good pilgrim. Good pilgrim. Good pilgrim. [normal volume] Good pilgrim. [Ava chuckles] Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much. Which mannerly devotion shows in this. [clears throat] For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch. And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. Now touch hands. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers, too? Ay, pilgrim. Lips that they must use in prayer. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray. Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Saints do not move, though grant, for prayers. Are we-- Okay. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sa-- Should I-- Am I... Do you want me to-- Just don't stop until I tell you. -Uh... -Are we-- Then move not while my prayers' effect I take. [Ava giggles] Thus... Uh, thus from my lips by yours, my sin is purged. Then-- Oh. Well, then-- then have my lips-- -[both giggling] -the sin that they have took. -A sin from my lips-- -[both giggling] -O trespass sweetly urged. -[quietly] This is weird. -Give me my sin again. -Again? -I-- -What is-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, guys. No, no, no. We're-- We don't kiss at the first rehearsal. Does everyone hear me? No making out at this stage. We are not sponsored by Tinder. -I'm sor-- -I didn't know what to do. I am sorry. I didn't ask. I just, I mean-- It's nothing. It was-- It was a kiss, a peck. I-- You told me not to... -Oh, my God. -It's-- It's nothing. It's-- I'm not that guy. I'm sorry. It's all right. It's-- It's all right. We're grownups, right? -[Ava laughing] -Well, last I heard. [Dylan] You two, uh... Are all wrong for this. We are very wrong. You have chemistry? -Oh, fuck no. No. No, no-- -No, we don't. We don't. We-- [Dylan] No. No, no, no. No, no, no. I-- I-- I really think... [sighing] ... I can make this work. -Fuck you. -I have to put my art first. [inhaling] [whimsical music] Ava? -Hi, it's, uh, Simon. -Oh! Oh, hi. -I-- I-- Sorry, I was just-- -Shopping. Look, um, I should apologize again for what happened last class. I-- No. It's nothing. -It-- I'm-- -Really, really. It's nothing. I-- I-- I'd-- I'd better-- No, me too, right? Life, right? Always in a rush and, um... Yeah, well, now that I'm no longer working... Well, I'm-- I'm still gainfully employed. Cutbacks, they-- they pushed a bunch of us out of the door. I think the average age there now is 12. Maybe it's nice, you know? -A chance to relax. -I love my job. Ah. I miss it. And my husband and my daughter, they-- they want me to cook now. Before, Matthew did most of it. That's my husband. But, well, now that I'm home all the time, it's-- it's only fair, right? -What do you do? -Medical research. I have a Ph.D. in microbiology. Incredible. I thought I was gonna cure cancer, but I didn't. So... Whatever I was going to do in life, it's-- it's done now, forevermore, apparently. You know this, um-- this cooking thing? If I buy restaurant food and pretend I cooked it myself, would that make me a-- would that make me a bad person? -Brilliant. -It's just to get them off my back, you know, -in the short term. -It'll be our secret. -[both chuckling] -Well, then. Bye. Bye. And you-- you're-- you're quite good at acting. You're-- You're really good. Oh. Well. Oh, thank you. It's a shame your moment of triumph didn't last longer than a minute. I did enjoy it. I-- It's just acting isn't for real people and... Like us. Ah, well, so many things weren't in the end. -What did you do instead? -I'm a geologist. Uh, I thought I'd be out in the wilds but I sit at a desk running computer simulations. Well, at least you still have a purpose. Oh, I'm just counting down the days 'til -I can have your life. -Oh! [both laugh] I guess I'll see you in class. You-- You were going this way, right? Can I-- Mind if I walk with you? Yeah, sure. We can... I-- I should apologize again, I-- No. It's-- It's-- No. -Forget that. -Yeah. [Debra] Oh, my God. That is quite the cooking course. I can't believe you made this, Mom. -Okay. Here we go. -Thanks. [Matthew] The other day, I saw your mother fixing a vase. [Debra] Wow. She's really settling into her new life. Sure is. Jigsaw puzzles. My mom does jigsaw puzzles, loves them. Oh. [Debra] Look at all pluses to you not working. Sorry, I have a headache. I think she's starting to adjust. -Right. -Yeah. -Yeah. -All right, well. -Let's dig in, shall we? -[Debra] Okay. Yeah. You think staying with one person your whole life is easy? Marriage isn't for sissies. Marriage is motherfucking hard. Lesson number one. You want to stay married? Don't let yourself fall in love with someone else. [whimsical music] [students yelling passionately] [student 1] Do you bite your thumb at me, sir? [student 2] I do bite my thumb! [Dylan] Intensity. Good intensity. Go back at her. Don't let her get the upper hand. Switch hands. Switch hands. [swords clanging] Good, good. Great job. There you go. Avenge him, avenge him. [Simon chuckling fades out] Was I happy? Sometimes. Yeah. And that's what love does, right? It tricks you into thinking you're happy. There are lots of ways of being miserable. There's only one way of being comfortable, and that is to stop running around after happiness. "If you make up your mind not to be happy, there's no reason why you shouldn't have a fairly good time." Edith Wharton. Words to live by. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it, and yet I would it were to give again. What? Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? But to be frank and, um, give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty is as boundless as the sea, my love as deep. The more I give to thee, the more I have, for both are infinite. You... are amazing. Have you been on the stage before? He had a triumph as Hamlet in his [indistinct] days. -Oh, thank you. -[Ava laughing] Well, I want you both to rehearse as much as you can, all right? And together. I want to see the sparks. The audience'll love it. The audience? Yeah. We put on a little show at the end. Invite our friends and family. [excited chattering] It'll be a night to remember, yeah! That's amazing! [bell rings] [Dylan] Okay, that's it for today. -Let's pack up. -[chatter continues] Great job. Great job. Great job. [student] Thank you, thank you, thank you. Wonderful job, wonderful job. Looking good. Uh, maybe we should run lines if we-- if we're actually gonna be seen in public. Ouch. -Uh-- -That... We are the stars. Heavy lies the head that wears the crown. Uh, let me give you my number. And, uh, if you have time, text me. I'll-- I'll give you mine, but will it make much difference? Well, it'd it be nice to be a little less... Uh, a little less horrible or otherwise. Ha ha! An achievable goal? God, I could use one of those. Uh, where's my bag? [sighs heavily] Okay. So, as I mentioned, Jeremy and I have something to discuss with you. -All right. -Let's hear it. Um, what if the two of us stay here until we save enough for a down payment on our own home? Oh. -I love that plan. -You do? We-- we'll save so much faster if we're not paying rent. And-- And Debra can go right back to work because Ava will be looking after the baby. She's here alone all the time anyway and doing nothing, so... Yes! She's always complaining how bored she is. She'll have the baby to keep her company. Mm, and cooking. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. We don't want to stop the cooking. -Mm-hmm. -But less time for Jigsaw. Nothing would make me happier. My baby will be safe with me, and my baby's baby. Thank you. I'm referring to my grandchild. Oh. [notification sounds] -No. -[notification sounds] -I think that's you. -Oh, that's me. Yeah. Oh, shit. -Easy. -That's just me. Okay. No one except us texts you since you stopped working. That is true. What is it? Uh, just someone from... It's just someone from the class. I, um-- I'll just go and, um, make a cup of tea. -Oh, cookies, please, Mom. -Me, too. -Just tea, thank you. -Maybe a sandwich, too? Oh, that sounds good. Maybe I'll have a sandwich, too. -Toasted, please. -Yes, toasted. [whispering] She's making friends. [pensive classical music] [panting] [breathing raggedly] -Mom? -[nervously] Hi. Oh, hi. Hello. What were you doing? Nothing. That-- That doesn't look like nothing. [Ava clearing throat] Okay, enough games. It's pretty obvious what's going on here. Yes, it is. Yeah. You have a lump in your breast. No. I-- I-- I mean, I-- I-- obviously, I check. I-- then, I-- but-- I'm being prudent, obviously. But... all, I suppose, lump-free. -[notification sounds] -That's me. And your nerves are terrible. [chuckles softly] Aren't you going to check the text you just got? Yes, yes, I will. And you're really out of breath, even though you were just lying down. And you're flushed. Do you have a fever? No, I'm-- All good. Oh, lovely. Yes, all good. Yay, healthy. Oh, God. What the fuck? [birds chirping] Well, I suppose there's no chance of a new job. Realistically speaking, as a female fired at my age, I could possibly get hired as a greeter at Wal-Mart. [both laughing] Well-- well, I know it wouldn't help with the bills, but I assume you've thought of volunteer work? Mm... I should, but, you know, living so far away from Toronto in this small city, it's... No, I should, I should, but... it's not where my strengths lie. I'm good at driving a research team and analyzing data, not at hand-holding. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much. Hang on, that's a Juliet line, isn't it? Mm-hmm. -Oh, shit, what's next? -Which-- -Shut up, no, wait. -Which-- No! Let me do it. Um. Yes. Which mannerly devotion shows in this, for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch and palm-- -Yeah. -Yes. And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers, too? -Yes. -[both laugh] True. Yeah. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. O, then, dear saint... -Uh, oh, no, no, no... -It's contagious. Let-- No. Let lips... -[sighs] Let lips do what hands do. Uh... they pray. Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. Then move not, while my prayers' effect I take. -Mm-- No. No. no, no-- -I-- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This-- No, it's-- -This is so wrong. -I-- It's wrong. [Ava muttering quietly] [whimsical music] [exhaling] My sister called. She wants us to come visit. Well, she doesn't really want us to come visit. She wants to say that she invited us. She knows I can't spend more than ten minutes with that idiot she married. So, anyway, I couldn't think of an excuse. So, there was just this awful silence that went on and on. And on. Hello? Earth to husband. Hello! I think I'm going to go for a walk. We never go for walks. Won't be long. Well, thanks for inviting me along. [door shuts] Sieve the tomatoes. I don't know how you sieve a tomato. Sieve the tomato. Oh, shit, on-- Yes. Oh! [glass shatters] [Simon muttering quietly]] [doorbell rings] Oh, I, uh, I'm-- I'm cooking. The stove is... I-- I-- I ju-- I-- I just wanted a brief word-- You're cooking? It's, uh, well, um. -Ah! Sorry. -I-- so, I-- I just wanted to-- That's-- that's way too high. Uh, and you-- you need some water. -Do you know how to cook? -Yes. How do you not die of boredom? I just wanted to say, what I did today in the park was completely out of line. No, no, no. It was my fault, too, because I knew what those lines led to. -Is there a lid? -A lid? Yes. Somewhere. Uh, lid! You know, I can never go back to class now. Look, we were only rehearsing. -That was not a rehearsal kiss. -Okay. Thank you. No, it wasn't. But I will never again. I-- I-- I promise. I would just like us to be friends. And that is all. You know, I'm-- I'm married, too. I-- I-- I can't believe we're having this conversation. You have to leave. No, no, no, no. What-- What if one of my family members came in? What would I say? You know, we can't end things like this. Mm. You need to add the spices now. Oh, spices? Shit! What the fuck is fenugreek? Here. [door shuts] -[both whispering] Oh, my God. -Someone's here. You were right. Is there a back door? French doors, French doors, back, back, back. -Wait, wait! -What? We-- We're not doing anything wrong. -We're-- we're-- we're cooking. -We're cooking. Debra? Oh, sweetheart, what's wrong? -Is it the baby? -No. He's cheating on me. -Oh. -Mom, he's cheating on me. Oh, darling. Drink this. I put lots of sugar in it. I don't want sugar. I'll get fat. And then I'll never lose the baby weight. No one will ever want me and I'll die alone. Jeremy and another woman, I-- Do-- Darling, do you know this for a fact? I saw them, Mom. I was walking past the coffee shop and their heads were so close together. I don't know her. She's-- she's got, like, red hair and pigtails. Who the fuck wears pigtails? No, that-- that-- that-- that-- that could be anything. You can't leap to conclusions. Two people that are acquaintances and their heads just happened to get close. And maybe-- maybe they even touch each other. Now, to a passerby, that would look more incriminating than it actually is. That kind of thing happens all the time. -No, it doesn't. No. -Yeah. -Heads don't bump by accident. -Well, I... -What do you think? -Are there other signs? We don't have sex anymore. That's a sign. Yeah. It's been a week. -Not that much of a sign. -Oh, I don't know what to do. I don't want to be a single mom. But then... I can't even handle the idea of parenthood with a husband. Is it like job hunting? You know, is it-- is it easier to find a new husband if you-- if you still have your old husband? But then how-- No, how can I stay with someone who would cheat on me when I'm pregnant? Um... No. I'll never forgive him. Oh, my God. -It's too late for an abortion. -Oh, sh-- If only I found out two months ago. [quietly] Can the-- Can the baby hear me? -No. -Great. Now the baby's gonna hate me, too. When I'm in labor, everyone in the hospital's gonna pity me and then he'll show up with his new girlfriend and I'll look like shit and she'll be all prettied up, the bitch. Shh, stay-- Now, listen to me, sweetheart. Stay calm. You do-- Listen. You don't have to make any decisions tonight. Hi, what's up? -Where were you? -I bought the baby a toy. A puppet set. -Hi, I'm Jeremy. -Simon. He's in mom's cooking class. Ah. Well, I'm going to assemble the puppets. Bye. [whispering] No idea. He did look suspiciously happy. Yeah, that's what I thought. But then he is happy most of the time. Yeah. It's one of the things I liked about him. No dark side. But then cheating on your pregnant wife's pretty fucking dark, if you ask me. I'll go and see what I can find out. Oh, thank you. He's just lovely. Yeah. [quirky music] Oh. Hello again. Texting someone? Reading the instructions from puppet assembly. -Lots of steps. -Let me help. -So... -[chuckles] Baby on the way. Yup. Yeah, I remember when my first child was coming. I-- You feel so much. So, so very much and... Oh. Yeah, I-- I think you're right. That goes with that. You know... [deep comical voice] Is this the end of my freedom? Doesn't this-- Oh, no, I see. Sure, you swore to death you do part at the wedding, but everyone knows divorce happens. It's-- People move on. Never see each other again. But when you-- When you create a life together, you're linked together forever. And, um... Wow. I hadn't thought of that. Oh, here's a hat! So, I know what you must be thinking right now. They look smaller on the website. Do I-- Do I lose my chance of happiness just because a random spermatozoa fertilized a random egg, God calls bingo and that's it? We're-- We're trapped until we die. I mean, that can't be how life is supposed to work. I mean, if it were, why-- why-- why would we still hear love calling to us? Sunny day and... ... we see a woman walking down the street at a nice, brisk pace. And she pauses to... ... push the hair out of her eyes and we know-- we just know she is the one we could love forever. So, Jeremy. Are you lying awake at night asking the question that eats away at all our souls? "Is this really the life I want to be living?" Uh... Okay, yeah. Maybe asking that a bit. You know, if you-- if you want a confessor, I-- well, I'm not-- I-- I mean, I-- I had a very priestly experience recently, so, you know... Feel free to confide. I don't know. You're gonna think, [goofy voice] is Jeremy out of his ever-loving mind? People think that a lot. Hey, hey. Priests. You can tell us anything. Well. What-- what you said? Yes. I keep thinking if I don't make this fantasy come true, I-- I may never have another chance. It's-- [goofy voice] That's all I can talk about. [Irish accent] You can share your secret with me, son. [goofy voice] Um.... J-- Hmm. Just between you and I, I've always wanted to... To... Oh... To... -I found out two things. -Yeah? One, he's an idiot. We knew that already, but... ... as idiots go, he is quite sweet. And-- and two? The puppets aren't for the baby. They're for him. His dream is to become a puppeteer. -Did you know that? -No. -[both laughing quietly] -Shh. Do you think-- Do you really think that's all? I have no idea. I gave him my number, right? I said call me if he needs to talk. Oh, God. Poor Debra. Well, you'll... You... wanting to go now? I'm-- I'm okay, I'm not in any hurry. My husband will be home soon, so... Good night. See you at class? Yeah. [sighs] Oh... -Mom. -Ah! If you want to nap, you've got a bed upstairs. Thank you, darling, for the reminder. -Are you okay? -I was... Oh. I don't know what I was. [chuckling nervously] You seem really confused. Just like me and my marriage. I'm lost. Let's see what happens over the next bit. And don't tell your dad until we have all the facts. He might kill him. "How dare you cheat on my pregnant daughter?" Something... [door shuts] [Debra sniffles] Something wrong? -No. -Good, good, good, good. But I think something might be wrong with Mom. Nonsense. Your mom's always fine. -She's-- she's dreamy. -Your mother's never dreamy. -She's not a dreamy person. -[Debra] She is now. And I know for a fact she thinks she has cancer. Bu-- but I think it might be something even worse. -Than cancer? -Alzheimer's. It can happen at her age. I just googled it. Your mother's smarter than the two of us combined. Her IQ is off the charts. She used to be smarter, but what's with the cooking? We had Coq Au Vin last Thursday and yesterday the toast was burnt? -Unpredictable moods. -She's only had a few classes. Maybe they haven't got to toast yet. Have you also noticed how she keeps smiling to herself? And not long ago, she was miserable. That's why we sent her to the cooking class. And for the food, of course. Exactly. Our plan is working. She's making friends. One of her cooking ladies texted her. Erratic behavior. And she was just leaning against that wall, napping while standing up. Something weird is going on. Do you have time to rehearse? We could, uh, we could go to the park? -Um... -No. No. No, no, I-- I... No. I should really go home. -It's-- -Yeah. Yeah. Bye. -Ava! -Oh, I don't want to have to spell it out, but we really shouldn't go to the park. -Look. -Huh? Oh. -Pigtails. That could be her. -Yeah. Jeremy does get off work around now and-- -Maybe we should-- -that is the direction -of his office. -Follow her. Okay, wait. Slow down, slow down. [quirky music] Don't get too close. [Ava whispering] Well, wha-- what do we do now? Just keep going, keep going. [Simon clears throat] Well, we-- we can't follow her if we're in front of her. Well, we just-- we walk slower, right? I am walking slowly. Now let's pretend to gaze. -Gaze? -Yeah, yeah, gaze. Gaze. Um... Hey, ho, look. Look-- look at the, um-- the-- the tree. Oh, yeah, it's a cool-- What's a-- What kind of tree is that? -I don't know anything about-- -It's a birch. Oh, it-- it's a birch tree. That's-- -- That is-- That's a fine specimen of a birch. -Yeah. -If ever I saw one. She's coming. Oh, and there's more. Oh, this-- That's-- That's a very impressive tree. That's-- that's really good. I love it, it's-- -Excuse me. -No apology. That wasn't very Canadian of her. Just the kind of woman who would sleep with a married man with a baby on the way. That's exactly what I was thinking. Come on. NO, no, no, they were really in love. Their-- Their tragedy is that they couldn't escape Verona. I-- I think their tragedy is the delusion that the infatuation would last. -Th-- That's what killed them. -Infatuation? That is love. She spotted us. [laughing nervously] How could she not? We've been following her for days. Ooh, finally a decent pace. Why is she scared of us? We're not scary. Well, maybe she thinks we're crazy people. Crazy people don't usually travel in twos. -Let's go! -[Ava laughing] [Ava] Why-- Why-- Why-- Why are you running after her? What are you gonna do if you catch her? Yeah, that's-- that's, uh-- that's a good point. [notification sounds] It's probably your wife. -No, it's Jeremy. -Oh. He say's gonna meet him tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's see what tomorrow brings. Where are we? [Simon] Yeah, we should've left breadcrumbs. You know, if that is the right redhead, she's-- she's gonna remember you. What are you gonna say to her when she asks -why you were following her? -Easy. She won't remember. I'm forgettable. You're not forgettable. That was kind of a compliment, if only you hadn't hurt my shoulder giving it to me. I-- I touched you very, very lightly. It's so late. I've been calling you. [Ava] Oh, Okay. Um. Yeah, sorry. I, um-- Yeah, I turned my phone off during the class and I forgot to turn it back on again. Well, where have you been? I just got a bit lost on the way home. Got... It's six blocks. [Jeremy clearing throat] Thank you for meeting me. -Oh, no problem. -Okay, confession time. I'm not just in love with the puppets. In addition, I'm in love... with a woman. Yes... my son. When I look at Carolyn, I feel just the way you described when you saw that woman brush back her hair on the street corner. The way Carolyn moves those puppets, it's-- it's awesome. Well, I don't know if that's exactly what I was trying to say. Of course, it must be even harder for you as a priest. You're married to God. Or is that just nuns? [medieval music] -He admitted it. -What? He told you he was having an affair? He didn't exactly say he was having sex with her, but he said he'd fallen in love with her, which is just as bad. No. Falling in love with another person isn't as bad as having sex with another person. Well, I-- I beg to differ. -Love-- Lo-- love is bigger. -Love is definitely smaller. If my wife would-- I would rather she had sex with someone -than fall in love with him. -I would much rather my husband fell in love with someone and kept his dick in his pants. Oh, but hey, Jer-- Jeremy could be having sex with this woman, too. Sex and love, nothing's more catastrophic than that. Can you find out? [music stops] [Dylan] Yeah, we'll be cutting the dance. -[quietly] I think that's wise. -Thank God. So, this woman... how, uh... how serious would you say it is? I-- I think she really likes me. I-- If I can only up my puppet game. She really loves puppets. Have you, uh... Have you spent much time alone together and... Well, I'm living with my wife and the in-laws, so there's not much privacy. Uh-huh. Carolyn's living with her parents. It's a long story. Her puppetry grant hasn't come through yet, but she's really sure she's getting it. If Carolyn doesn't deserve one, who does? So, you haven't consummated the relationship yet? -Consum... -Have you fucked her? It was just once-- well, twice. You will never see my daughter again. -You will never see that baby. -[Debra] What do I do? Well, you can start by cutting that little asshole -right out of your life. -Are you serious? ♪ What's your daughter gonna do? Right now, she's listening to Matthew, who says she must banish Jeremy from her life forever. It's understandable. Yeah, but he gets to be single again. She gets a screaming baby and diapers. Is that really the best move? Well, I'll keep in touch with Jeremy and I'll find out what's going on in the puppet world. Mm. I'd better-- don't want them to figure out the secret. Thank you. Thanks for your help with Jeremy. It's getting cold. Here. -Suits you. -Thank you. I was gorgeous. I was. You should've seen me. They made me prom queen. I could have had anyone. But Simon made me laugh. Yeah. The men who make you laugh, they're the real heart breakers. So... How did I feel getting a call from someone I don't even like saying, "Ros, how ya doing? And by the way, didn't I see your husband getting all cozy with another woman?" [whimsical music] [Simon speaking indistinctly] -[Ava] No, no, no. -[Simon] But-- you're so good at the verse. It's like-- it's like a natural -thing-- -That really is not true. No. I mean, no, no. You-- [Ros] Hi, honey. Oh, my Go-- I didn't expect to run into you. I was just at the hairdresser. How do I look? Oh, hi. Who's your friend? -This is, uh-- this is Ros. -Ava. -Ava Ringland. -Ros. -Hi. -Simon's better half. Nice to meet you. So you must be in his drahma class. Sounds like so much fun! Actually, yeah, it-- it kind of is, much to my surprise. Oh, well, I'd love to hear about it, but I just-- I don't have time. Hey! Why-- Why don't you come for dinner. Maybe Friday night? I would just love to meet some of his classmates. Are you married? You can bring your hubby. Oh, oh, we barely know each other. -We're not-- -Is it an allergy thing? 'Cause I can make anything. All that gluten-schmuten, no fried kitten stuff? [Ros laughing] Or is it something else? Something I don't know about? Yes, I... My family don't know I'm taking the drama class. Oh. I originally signed up for the cooking class, but-- they really want me to become a better cook. But-- Anyway, I haven't told them I've switched. Well, we can keep secrets, can't we? Don't you worry, I won't let the truth slip out. So. Friday night, eight o'clock. We're at 87 Rosewood. I'm... Matthew and I will be there. Hey, that's great! See ya at home. Mwah. You should really take pottery next semester. Super fun. I wasn't going to act like I had anything to be ashamed of. He kissed me, not the other way around. I know, yeah. I know that's bullshit. [chuckles] I said yes because I thought meeting his wife, getting to see his home... that would put an end to... ... to... ... well, whatever it was that was happening. We'd be done. And... If I... had to do it again, would I have gone? I don't know. Don't know. I mean, how many decisions do you rethink? How far back do you go? Maybe it all went wrong the first time you let that lad kiss your cheek in the schoolyard, you know? Oh! I loved that first kiss. In fact, I kissed him. Jimmy Cartwright. Oh, my God. He was a doll. Wonder what he's doing now. [Matthew] I still don't understand why we have to have dinner with these people. You told me to make new friends. I meant during the day when I'm working. [Ava] Quiet now, quiet now. Oh, hey. That looks delicious. Simon made it. I did the salad and dessert. This course the two of them are taking is amazing. I can't believe the improvement in Ava's cooking. It's a miracle. [under breath] A miracle. Oh, no, I don't drink. You don't? No, uh, my goal is to remain as smart and sane as possible. There's times when I'm happy to throw all that away for a little madness. Well, isn't this nice? Having new people to tell my old stories to? These days, the only reason I get up in the morning is insomnia. -Cheers. -[Simon] Cheers. -Cheers. -[Matthew] Cheers. Salad, Ida? It's, uh-- it's Ava. Oh, I'm so sorry. I was sure it was Ida. Okay? Ava. I can work on that. -[coughs] -[Ros] Oh. [Ava] Oh, shit. Are you... all good? Good. [Ros clears throat] -Do you have any children? -Uh, yes, a daughter. We're going through a bit of a nightmare with our Debra right now. She married a complete asshole. [Ros] Ah. Small world. Our two, boy and a girl, married assholes, too. But at least we don't live anywhere near them, so we manage to dodge all the "pick up the dog shit" bullshit. [Matthew] Well, looks like our Debra's gonna be a single mom. Fortunately, Ava here is gonna help raise the baby. Oh, wow. You're a better human being than I am. When the grandkids start coming, I am moving to Barcelona. And I'm not leaving my phone number. -So don't you tell them. -[chuckles] You know what? There's something about this wine. It's not quite right. I think we should open the bottle that you brought. Mattie, do you want to help me in the kitchen? I am just horrible with corks. Excuse us. You shouldn't have come. -Hi. -Hey. Come here. [whispering] So. I think they're falling in love. -Who? -Your wife and my husband. -That's ridiculous. -Is it? -They've barely spoken. -Exactly. -Also, Ava would never-- -It's probably just a phase. But then again, that's what I said about my son, and the next thing I knew, he was an accountant. So, we shouldn't let it get too far. This is, uh, all in your imagination. -We could Shania Twain them. -What? Oh, never mind. Just keep an eye on your wife. I am too old to be single. I'll open this. Excuse me. Yeah! So, anyway, I was a wannabe bad girl. I taught Sunday School, but I stole. -You stole? -Yeah, just little things, you know, like, uh, lipstick. Oh, once a very fancy bra. Oh, that was such a high. I kept stealing 'til I was in my 20s. Not to get all lawyer on your ass, but, uh, you know, if you had been caught at that age-- Mm, but I wasn't caught. You can get away with a whole lot with dimples. [giggling] Oh, my God! Why did I confess this? Honestly. Okay. Somebody else has to confess something. -Ada. -Ava. Oh, my goodness, I did it again. Oh, me? No. I-- I-- No. So far I never-- I-- I haven't stolen any-- No. But you do have a secret, right? Matthew. You're not going to believe this, but your wife and my husband have not been taking -cooking classes together. -Of course they are. They're taking drama classes. I'm sorry, I know I wasn't supposed to say anything, but come on, how can this nice man get upset about his wife and a little amateur play? Yes. Well... I hated the cooking class, so, yeah, I switched to drama. They were-- They were desperate for one more person and-- They're doing Romeo and Juliet. Simon is the priest, and I bet she's the nurse. Actually, we're playing-- She was-- She's-- She's very good. -Sorry? -Your wife. Aww. And Simon always regretted not becoming a professional actor. That's not true. I... You know, I did... I did it when I was very young. Well, we all do things when we're young that we don't do now. You. In a play. That'll be seen in public? Mm-hmm. And there's a big show at the end. No, it's-- it's just for friends and family. It's-- It's not the whole play. It's gonna be adorable. It's just like when our kids put on a show in the garage, tap dancing their little hearts out. [Ros chuckles] I don't think I've ever seen Romeo and Juliet. It doesn't end well. [footsteps approaching] [Debra sighs] How was your evening? All I did was cry. Well, don't let yourself get dehydrated. [Debra] I don't know why my heart feels so broken. Oh! I remember on my wedding day thinking, you know, "Was this the best you can do?" I thought I was gonna marry Jon Hamm. Oh! [Ava chuckles] -Mom. -Yes? I want you to know that... ... if anything were to happen to you... ... I'm gonna tell my baby about you. Oh. Every bedtime story will star my mom. Well, I'm not going anywhere that I know of. -You're gonna make me cry. -No, no. And, you know, if-- if there are some things that you don't remember... I will remember them for you. Thank you, darling. So, your mother's been leading a secret life. -Oh. -What? [Matthew] She's not taking a cooking class. She's acting in some amateur play with the guy we had dinner with tonight. Oh, okay. That's weird. And it's Romeo and Juliet. It's just a few scenes. -Oh. Who do you play? -[Matthew] The nurse. Oh, I-- That makes sense. I can see that. Does it? What's the nurse like? Oh, she's a nice, fussy woman who looks after people. Mom will be great. And memorizing is good exercise for the brain. [Ava] Hmm. Okay, then. Night-night. -[Ava] Night. -[Matthew] Night, hon. Fuck. Mm. I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but that woman tonight was stark raving mad. I kinda liked her. Oh, no, she was nice, but you missed the really, really weird part. She thinks that you and that husband of hers are smitten with each other. -She said, "smitten?" -[Matthew] Smitten. You and that boring little nobody. [Ava] Yeah. [Matthew] I guess she needs to think that he's a prize or something rather than the loser he actually is. Humph. And can you imagine him, thinks he can become an actor at his age? Ah, well, I guess they deserve each other. [footsteps retreating] See you upstairs. [emotional piano music] [sniffles] [exhales deeply] Here we go. [notification sound] Oh, crap, it's sent. ♪ [knocking] ♪ ♪ [Ava] Before we went to the motel room, it was like we were ill, like-- like in a fever, you know? I couldn't stop thinking about him. I-- I knew that we had to end it, but... ... I-- I couldn't. If even meeting his wife didn't work... So, um... ... the only solution I could see was to confront reality in all of its pain and humiliation. You know, the two of us at our age. So, I thought we'd fumble around in the dark in a sad little motel room, two tired saggy people, and we would see that there's nothing special there. And then we could put it behind us and... ... we'd get on with our normal lives. I was mad. Completely fucking mad. I-- I think we both were. What time is it? No idea. I think it's getting late. It was the nightingale and not the lark. I must be gone and live or stay and die. Lest you stay 'til we die then, solve that problem. Love you. Love you, too. Lover? Lover, my lover. Lover. I don't know, it's-- it's a... It's a-- kind of a delicious, indiscreet word, isn't it, "lover"? My lover? Lover. I-- Well, it's certainly a word I never thought I'd have occasion to use. I still struggle to believe that it was me, that-- that woman in that creaky motel bed. Have you ever done this before? What? No. You? Not even close. Do you feel guilty? It's not a question I ask myself. I guess you do? He cheated on me once. Matthew. He did? Yep. I wanted to die. I made actual suicide plans. I-- I had just had Debra, so... The hardest thing about becoming a parent is that it means you'll never be able to kill yourself. You'd fuck them up too much. [Simon laughs] We were broke and Matt was still at law school, and I-- I couldn't handle moving to some rented room, going on welfare, traipsing around in the snow with a screaming baby and... I was-- I was just way too humiliated to go home, so I vowed to leave him as soon as I got on my feet. But... guess what? [chuckles] My life went on and she adored her daddy, so... [sighs] What he did to you, that's unforgivable. Says the married man in a motel room with a married woman. You don't know what's forgivable and what's not forgivable until it happens to you, but... Did I forgive him, though? I'm not sure I ever really loved him after that. But then, you know, years have gone by where I haven't even thought about it. Some-- some, I don't know, quick fuck he had with an old girlfriend when we were different people. Perhaps it's easier to forget than forgive, but you see, that is why I cannot give my daughter some self-righteous lecture. [pensive piano music] I still don't know if I made the right choice. Sometimes I think he doesn't even remember doing it. Oh, my God, to this day, I-- I still wish he had just fallen in love with her. Love-- love is-- It's just a dream. But sex... Oh, fuck. Sex is real. [upbeat jazzy music] -Mom? -Oh! I can't believe you're here. Debra, it's Debra. I thought you were better than this. Look, I-- I can explain. I-- I-- I'm-- I am... -I'm here be-- -Well, I know why you're here. You do? Oh, whoa. Yeah, that-- I-- I admit it. I-- You followed me. -What? -I'm not stupid. It's obvious you followed me here, so don't try to deny it. I did, yes. I-- I-- I followed you here be-- and you're here because-- If he can sleep with someone else, so can I. Oh. That's why you're here? That's-- that's why I followed you here. I'm not stupid, either. These days, pregnant women can sleep around, too. Not just men who are married to pregnant women. That has been established. Okay? Slut shaming is over. Yes. Well, is he someone I know? It's the, uh, guy from Food Mart. Food Mart? The cute one. Carries groceries out to the car. Oh, yeah, yeah. He-- he's cute. Whoa, he's married. Well, yeah, or we-- or we wouldn't -have to go to a motel. -Debra, a married man? -That's ma-- crazy-- -For all I know, the puppet lady's married, too. Oh, Debra, sweetheart, are you sure? No. No, no, honestly. No, I don't feel like sex with anyone. -Mm-hmm. -I have to pee every two minutes. It's hard to work up any momentum. I was just going to text Jeremy a selfie of the two of us in bed. -Let me take you home. -Okay. -Come on. -Oh, no, no, no. Maybe I should text him. 'Cause he could stay waiting there for hours. You know men-- optimists. I don't really know the etiquette for this situation. Come on. [Jeremy] Are you expecting a call? [Simon] I just, uh... Just someone I haven't heard from since yesterday and, uh... I made a horrible mistake. Hmm? I want to be married to Debra. And living in Ava and Matthew's house and-- and feeling our baby move in her tummy-- I had all that. I can't believe I threw it away. And how's it going with the puppy lady? Puppet. Puppet lady. What was I thinking? All she and I have in common is the puppets. That's not enough! However delightful they are. I don't know if I would've slept with Carolyn if you hadn't given that big speech about, "Is this the right life? Maybe I should go after women on street corners." What, you only-- you only slept with her after that? Yes. You made leaving your wife sound just wonderful. But it's not. -[notification sounds] -Yes. No, no, no. No... Oh, my God. Bad news? I should, um... I don't know what to do. Then maybe I shouldn't ask you what to do to win back Debra. You'd think sitting for 10 hours alone in the motel room would bring some clarity but it doesn't. It's... Motel. I wasn't thinking that, though. Maybe a big romantic gesture might work. I-- All those horrible thoughts: "Is she dead? Does she not-- Does she not love me anymore? Did she just misplace her phone?" -And then... -Debra loves a nice hotel. We stayed in one on our honeymoon. Champagne, strawberries, Jacuzzi tub. Fuck... Okay, bad idea, but it's all have. -I need to go somewhere. -Where? -Need a drink. -Okay, can I come? Have you ever thought of suicide? You think that will help win her back? Isn't it a bit risky? What if she doesn't get there in time and I actually died? Not as a tactic. Because... Because there's no reason to go on. I don't think things are that bad. I have my health and the puppets. I can't return them even if I wanted to. They-- they were final sale. So... Yeah. Going for a drink. I had to do it. I-- I had to. I had a pregnant daughter who needed me. It's my husband, it's Simon's wife. And what the hell was I thinking? You-- you have to have a moral code. You can't just-- You can't just be happy. So, I said in my text that I would do the play-- It was almost done anyway. But when the play was finished, that was it. We were done. [doorbell rings] I have a delivery. Oh, shit. -Um. Can I just refuse? -Are you Debra? N-- Oh, no, no. Uh, okay. No. Oh, thank you. Debra! If these are from Food Mart Boy, he's very forgiving. -They're from Jeremy. -Hmm. He wants me to meet him at Paragon. -That's a nice hotel. -Yeah. Way nicer than Food Mart Boy's sleazy motel. I mean, that was really sleazy. Well, I would imagine motel costs would add up, you know, if an affair goes on for a while. I mean, what are the options? Plus, if you're married, you-- you can't put it on your credit card. You have to pay up. Um, uh, what-- what does the card say? He loves me. -Oh. -Should I go? It has to be your choice. These smell so beautiful. Go. Dad'll be mad. I'll say you're at a friend's. He loves me more than puppet girl. Yes! But do I even want him after everything that he put me through? Just see how it feels. And listen, any decision you make now doesn't have to be the final decision. There is no statute of limitations on telling your husband to get the fuck out of your life. And no matter what, I'll still be here to help you with the baby as much as you need. Thanks, Mom. You seem more like yourself. I guess it wasn't Alzheimer's after all. Hmm. Well, they are close, aren't they? Dementia and love. [chuckling] Yeah. [snoring] [gentle whimsical music] [crickets chirping] [Simon] Ah! [slurred] I will be back soon and I-- I will not be alone. [balloon popping] [mumbling incoherently] The door... [stumbling] [continues mumbling] Keys... [quirky, sneaky music] [snoring] -[Ava gasps] -Shh. [Matthew snoring] [whispering] How the fuck did you get in? -I borrowed-- shh! -What? What? -I borrowed Jeremy's key. -What? Jeremy knows about us? -No, no, no. He know-- shh. -What is happening? He-- He thinks I'm liberating the puppets. -What? -He's very easy to lie to. Oh, God. What are you-- Whoa. Not that it will matter after tonight. What are you trying to do? -A grand romantic gesture. -Oh, God. Simon. [Simon grunting] -Ow. Oh. -Oh, my ankle. -I hurt you? -[Ava] Ugh. It's okay. -Did I hurt you? -It's fine. It's just-- Ow. It's-- it's all right. It's-- it's an old injury. It's just-- Oh, look, it doesn't matter. [Simon] Let me kiss it better. [Ava] No, go-- no, go-- Go to the-- go to the door. Go on. [Simon grunting] -Shh. -[Ava] Yes. There's... There's a limo waiting outside with champagne and strawberries. And there's no-- Okay, there's no Jacuzzi-- I'm sorry about that-- But there's-- Uh, you-- I can take you wherever you want to go. That is my husband. Fortunately, a very deep sleeper, but you have to leave before he wakes up. -Don't worry. I've taken care-- -Shh! -- of everything. Debra and Jeremy-- Jeremy is wooing Debra back even as we speak and then they'll be married. And then, uh, you'll be free from-- for us to get married. You s-- I know that's why you said you had to stop seeing-- You're a good mother. You are. But now we can be together. -We're... -Men. As a gender, you really have to stop coming up with solutions. ♪ Love, we are in love, and love ♪ -Simon, just go. -♪ Conquers all ♪ -Go. Just go. -I'm gonna-- I'm gonna chill. I'm gonna wake up your husband now. -No. No. -I shoulda done that at the start, but I was a little worried you wouldn't let me -carry you out. -No! My-- We-- Yes. No. God, you're-- You're so drunk. You know, I hate drunks. -Stop-- Stop it! -This is our moment, pussycat. -Simon, go down the stairs. -Go downstairs, Simon. -Yeah. -Yes. -I'm going down the stairs. -Go-- -To the limo! -Shh. -Shh. To the lim-- -[Simon's back cracking] -Oh! -[Simon gasping in pain] -Let me help you. -No, no, I'm okay, I'm okay. -What've you done? -No, I'm supposed to be -carrying you! -Shh! -I said I'm... -No, no, no, Simon. -I got my second wind. -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. I do not wish to die being knocked down a flight of stairs by a man who claims to love me. Fitting, though, that end might be. -Come on, gimme your arm. -I'm okay-- That's it, gimme your arm. That's it. -You're gonna like the limo. -What? -The limo. -Shh! -It's no-- There's no Jacuzzi. -Okay. [Simon] I'm sorry. -[exaggeratedly] Ooh... -[Ava] Stop it. -[Simon] Ah... -[Ava] Please. -[Simon groans loudly] -[Ava] Shut up! -[Simon] I'm trying. -For God's sake. -[Simon groans] -Bloody hell, you're heavy. -[Simon] Ooh. -Si-- It's really-- Ooh. -No, no, no-- Wai-- See. -Quiet. See how well we work together? -Yes. -See how-- Crap. Ow-- Oh! -Sorry. -It's okay. -I kiss it better? -No. No. We're-- We're a good team. -Yes. -Well, I'm not very good. -I'm terr... -Simon. -You have to be quiet. -You're gonna love the limo. -It's-- -Simon. I haven't been in one before except when my father died. But you're gonna really like this. -Simon, you have to be quiet. -Come on. -Simon! -It's got balloons! Simon, stop it! Now, listen to me. Listen. Can you do that? You hit me. Simon, don't make this any harder than it already is. Listen. These... These are the reasons why I fell in love with you. Okay. And now I'll tell you the reasons I fell in love with you. And the-- oh, the curve of your neck-- -Ah, that will be-- -Listen. Shh. Simon. -top of the list-- -Shh. And then number... Listen. I... I fell in love with you because I lost my job. It's because I felt useless, because... Because I thought nothing good or interesting or-- or big or-- or-- or-- passionate would ever happen to me again. It's be-- It's because I wanted to be wanted, because-- because in the play I got to pretend to be in love and be loved and it felt fucking wonderful. I don't know what your reasons are, but I suspect they are very similar. We are not, I-- I repeat, we are not Romeo and Juliet. We are just two people who are old enough to know better. I can't live without you. Yes, you can. It is insane to love me this much. It's me, it's-- It's me, it's only me. Now please. For God's sake, go home to your wife. That's really what you want me to do? Yes. [car pulling up] What the...? [Simon grunting and panting] Ooh. [whimpering] [exhaling in pain] [plaintive piano music] [sobbing] ♪ [footsteps approaching] [breathing painfully] [wincing] Oh, God... Hi. -You're home. -Huh? -Wha-- -I-- I pulled my back out. Oh. You poor baby. Don't move. I'll get you a nice ice pack. Okay? People fall in love, and then they fall out of love. It's just a matter of waiting. Because nobody dies of a broken heart in real life, right? They just see that perfect, shiny being for who they really are and... stop loving them. I mean, it might be different if you're with, like, a Jon Hamm or Idris Elba, but for the rest of us... So, when it became obvious that Ava, yes, I knew her name, had pulled the plug on their little affair, I had two choices. I could kick him out, punish him, and end up with half my savings, half the value of the house minus the moving cost, the legal fees, the real estate commission, and grow old alone, or I could go back to normal. Well, it wasn't actually that easy a decision. I did briefly consider one other option. [Simon snoring] [grunting snore] Here, sweetheart. Got a pillow for ya, make you a little comfier. -Up, up, up. -Oh. That's it. Is that better? There. Thank you. Any time. [snoring] They all snore. Even the Romeos. Well, that was our final rehearsal. Tomorrow night is show time. Everyone, get some sleep. Ava. Simon. Could I have a moment? I have plans. I'll just take a second. Not only did you seem to not want to touch him today, you didn't even want to look at him. And you. Romeo ends up suicidal, but he doesn't start out that way. I don't know what is going on -with the two of you, but-- -Nothing. Nothing is going on. After tomorrow, it's your lives. But for one night, I need you to recapture the magic. [audience chattering] Hi. Can I sit right there? -Sure. -[Ros] Thank you. Front row, huh? Won't that be embarrassing when we fall asleep? [Ros chuckles] And you must be the pretty preggy one? I'm Ros. And that would make you puppet man? The puppets are in my past. Ah. Do you like my broach? I picked it up on the way here. -Hmm? Oh. -Oh, it's about to start. [delicate piano playing, audience whispering] If I profane with my unworthiest hand this... ... holy shrine... ... the gentle sin is this. My lips, two blushing pilgrims ready stand, to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. They're Romeo and Juliet. What? Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much. Which mannerly devotion shows in this, for saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch. And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? Ay, pilgrim. Lips that they must use in prayer. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray. Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. Then move not while my prayers' effect I take. Thus from my lips by thine, my sin is purged. Then have my lips, a sin that they have took. Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged. Give me my sin again. [audience murmuring] There's a lot of kissing in this play. Don't worry. It'll be over soon. Are priests allowed to do that? I shall forget to have thee still stand there, remembering how much I love thy company. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget, forgetting any other home but this. Parting is such sweet sorrow that I shall say good night 'til it be morrow. With a kiss... ... I die. Romeo. What's here? A cup, closed in my true love's hand? Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end. O churl, drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after? I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on them, to make die with a restorative. Thy lips are warm. [chief watchman] Lead, boy. Which way? Yea, noise? [Ava gasps] Happy dagger. This is thy sheath. There rust... ... and let me die. [whispering] I will always love you. No, you won't. [applause] And that was that. I pulled myself together. -[chuckles] -Yeah, I did. I pulled myself together. Um... -I learned how to cook. -[laughs] Yeah. It's not that hard, really. Um, I did volunteer work. I got outdoors, did stuff. And then, eventually... [whimsical music] Oh, uh... -I-- I was just leaving. -I was going... in. You, uh-- you taking another course? No, I'm teaching. Yeah, yeah. Um, it's just basic science for beginners. It's part time for now, but still it's, you know... -That's great. -And you..? Uh, I was-- I was doing another drama class. Dylan asked me to play Hamlet. Oh. Oh, that's lovely. -I-- No. No, me too. -I'd better, you know-- Listen, it's-- I'm glad to, um-- It's great to see you again. -Yeah. -Oh, uh, uh... So, what happened with the baby? Oh, yeah. Yeah, it is a-- It's a girl! Yeah! -Hortense. Don't ask. -[both laughing] Yeah. Oh, she's a sweetheart. And, uh, Jeremy, did they...? -They're still together. -Okay. For now. Yeah. Well, it's nice to know how the story ends. Yeah, and your wife? Uh, she-- she-- she had a little brush with, um, -uh, shoplifting. -Okay. S-- oh. But, uh, they just gave her community service. She's fine. We're fine. Well, you look great, so. So do you. -You take care. -You too.
