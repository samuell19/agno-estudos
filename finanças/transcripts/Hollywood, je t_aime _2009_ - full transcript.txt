Honestly... No, it's stupid. What?. I hate my job in Paris. So, I don't know... I was thinking-- Oh, you came to be star! A star, but, I told you it was stupid. No, it's not stupid.

Your loss, cocksucker. - Bye! - Call me, Booboo. Wha- What happened?. We know this girl named Lakeesha. She went out with him two weeks ago and we have not seen her since. And when you call her up her phone goes straight to voicemail. Before that, Lakeesha always picked up her phone. Just wanted to let you know, honey. Just a warning, Boo. OK?. Thank you. Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - You're welcome. He is so cute. Very cute. I'm a' go holler at him. Hold on. Hey, hey! Excuse me! Excuse me! Where you from?. From Paris, France. I moved from Lafayette, Louisiana a while back. Where are you going dressed like that?. I was at the beach and I'm going to Wilcox and Selma. Oh, Wilcox and Selma?. That's perfect. My best girlfriend is over at the Spotlight. Ah, the Spotlight bar?. I know this bar. Oh, really?. My luggage was stolen. There is nothing in my room. Your luggage was not stolen. It was relocated because we needed that room. But it's my room. Not anymore it's not. You only paid for one night. Remember?. I rented your room to somebody else. You can give me your key for your luggage. Welcome to the Z Hotel. How can I help you?. I'm looking for a room. Do you have a reservation?. No. Yes, I have a suite available - - with a king size bed and a view - - of the Hollywood sign for just $290 - - $375 - - $31 5 a night. $31 5?. That's right. Is there anything else less expensive?. No, I'm afraid that's our lowest rate. Thank you. I will continue to look. Sorry. Vodka tonic. $5.50. You left me nothing last night. What?. In America we tip the bartender. Ah, yes, the tip. Sorry. Ah, Lakeesha. No, I'm Kaleesha. Oscar, could you get up?. Get up! So, Jérome, je vous présente:. The Lady Norma Desire. I'm not French, but enchantée, I'm sure. Hello, nice to meet you. So, Jérome, what's with that suitcase?. Oh, I moved from my hotel. It was a piece of shit. But now every place that I've found is terribly expensive. I can't pay $300 for a night. And I don't know-- Excuse you! Can I get you a drink?. No, no, thank you. I can get my own. Hell, no! So, Jérome, Norma has this beautiful house in Silverlake. It's nice, Silverlake?. If you like baby strollers and Volvos. Well, I was gonna crash at her place tonight anyway and I was thinking... My home has always been a short-term refuge for lost souls here in the city of angels. We were thinking that maybe if you could front our taxi ride over there then... 'cause it gets a bit ugly on the bus this time of night. Yeah, OK. Let's go. Let's go. Home, sweet home! I've been preserving it since the '80s. It was just me and the Mexicans back then. Ah, those were the days. I like, it's, uh... Shabby chic, as the say in English - emphasis on the shabby. Kaleesha, honey, do you want some vino?. Rule number one for staying in my house:. What I say goes. You piss me off, you're out of here. Absolute power. You're French; you ought to be familiar with the concept. No drugs beyond the boos and the nummy. No guests. And finally, you'll have your very own room. You'll never entire mine, ever. She's got it bad for you. You should have heard her tell me about this hot frog she followed down the boulevard. Promise me you won't hurt her. I'm not-- Sorry, I don't like... Homeless black trannys?. Follow me upstairs. This is what I can offer you. It's a work in progress, as you can see. My last guest in this room - well, I just didn't have the heart to clean it after he left. Oh, yeah. He had a ferret. The aroma sort of lingers a little bit. Or if you prefer, I'm sure Kaleesha would like your company down on the couch. Oh, no, it's OK. Well, with that, I bid you, "au revoir." # Hello. French?. Yeah, I'm French, yeah. Some nudity required?. Does this mean it's a porno?. Uh, what is SAG?. What do you think you're doing?. I found this broom and-- Where's Kaleesha?. I don't know. I went out this morning and when I came back she was gone. Well, what do we have here?. It's nothing. Far be it for me to piss on your parade, Jérome, but let me give you a little advice. Nobody gets discovered anymore. That element of the Hollywood dream - it's long since expired. I was just curious. And I can tell by your casting pursuits and your sudden burst of housework you want to stay a while at the Chez Norma?. The Olive Motel on Sunset has a room rate that I can't pay, but if the room is free, maybe I can improve it?. Remember the rules... And remember it's temporary. I'll get you a key. You go to the West Hollywood?. Yeah, keep movin'. Ah, OK. Hello. What's up?. I have to ask - where in West Hollywood are you going?. No, I'm visiting a friend. Why?. Where are you going?. I mean what intersection are you going to?. Ah, Santa Monica Boulevard. Yeah, this is the Santa Monica Local. Santa Monica and what?. - La Cienega. - La Clenega?. Yeah. You totally could have taken the Rapid Bus. The Rapid Bus?. Yeah, the 704, the Santa Monica Express. When you're going long distances in LA it's all about the Rapid Bus. So it's better to take the Rapid Bus?. No, no, no. You're on the bus. Once you're on one bus, don't ever get off to wait for another bus. You'll regret it. Trust me. Do you work for the bus?. No, but I'm car-free. I have been for two years now. You're either part of the problem or you're part of the solution. You know?. I never learned to drive. Don't start. Hey, you made it. Come in. Bonjour. Bonjour. Jérome, this is Sarah. Sarah, Jérome. Sit. You good?. Very fine, yeah. Good, good. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. How do l, uh-- Well, here, put your lips on the hole. And I'm going to light and you suck. Suck, suck, suck, suck. Yep, now don't forget to pull out. Ooh, it's strong. Yes, it is. Wait, are you ltalian?. No, I am French. Handsome ltalian, 25 to 30, must cast before Christmas to shoot before New Years. Oh, yeah, it's Christmas. Who's your agent?. An agent?. No I don't have an agent. But you're an actor, right?. Yeah, yeah, I am an actor. How old are you?. Twenty-nine. You're 29. Yeah, 29, but I'm not ltalian. I come from France. It doesn't matter. The casting director was telling me today that all her submissions are too Latin. You're white, you have a big nose, you have an accent. Close enough. Do you have a headshot that you could email me?. No, I don't have a headshot. Yet! You don't have a headshot yet, but you will. Fresh off the boat, right?. You're not leaving for Christmas, are you?. Yeah, I'm here for Christmas. Can you stand up against this wall here?. Why not?. Oh, I gotta go. Ross, can I get a quarter bag on the way out?. Yep. Take your pick. The prettiest one. For the prettiest girl. Thank you. I can't make any promises, sweetie, 'cause you're really green. Can I hit one of those for the road?. Yeah, of course. Thanks, babe. OK, sweetheart. Ross knows how to get hold of you?. Yeah, you can reach him through me. See you later. See ya! That was bizarre. That was Sarah. That never happens, by the way. No, but ltalian, 29 years old. Well, I think you better get a local cell. Ah, yeah, maybe, yeah. All right... Suck. Yeah, good suck. Two, six, two, eight. Now, I'll call you. Now, OK. [phone rings] Voilà! Now you have mine, too. I just can't believe it. I've been here for over a year and I've never met an agent. It's like it was destiny or somethin. Yeah. Good morning, Norma. Where's the orange juice?. Jérome met an agent yesterday, and he has an audition today! Yeah, sorry, Norma. I will buy more orange juice after my casting. Hello. Hi. You are Tiffani?. That's right. And you?. What's your name?. Jérome, Jérome Beaunez. I don't have a résumé or headshot...or agent. It's my first casting. Maybe I should go. No, wait. Stay. It's an open call for a music video. It's not Shakespeare. I don't have an agent either. But, uh... Shhh. Don't tell anyone, but that's my mom's cell phone. Just write down somebody's number that you trust and make up an agency name. Oh, and when they call you in, tell them that you, like, forgot your headshot. Oh, yeah. The audition starts as soon as you enter the building. OK, so this is going to be quick and easy. You're gonna do slates and profiles, then I'm gonna put on the music, and then you're gonna dance as if you're in a nightclub. After a minute or so I'm gonna call you one by one. You're gonna come forward to the camera and give a solo dance. And just keep it cool, sexy, casual. Any questions?. OK, first up is Jerome Beaneze. No, no, no, no! Slates and profiles first, then we dance. Slates and profiles?. You look into the camera, you give your name and your agency, and then profiles. Do you want to restart?. Yes, please. This is why I fucking hate open calls. Darlin' you are preachin' at the choir. We are rolling. Jerome Beaneze. I am Jérome Beaunez, from Kaleesha Talent. Kaleesha Talent, interesting. Profiles. All right. Amber Sparks. Amber Sparks. I'm represented by DDA. Thanks, Amber. All right, Steve Jaspers. Steve Jaspers, Actors Unlimited. Thank you, Steve. And finally, Tiffani Schein. Hi. Tiffani Schein, Caroline Talent. All right... Let's do this. [dance music plays] And solo dance, Jérome! Amber. Steve Jaspers. OK. Tiffani Schein. OK. That's it. Thanks, everybody. Thank you very much. Thanks. Thanks so much for having me. Yeah. Saiyonara. What is that?. So what are you into?. Whatever you like. Presently I am all bottom. Dude, there's no way I can top tonight. I've done way too much partying - way too much partying. Yeah, I understand. You're French, is that right?. Yeah. I work in a French restaurant in Echo Park called Café l'Etoile. You speak French?. No. Beyond bouillabaisse and steak frites, no. You look like Adrien Brody. I want you to fuck me. I'm sorry. I need to go. Good morning, handsome. Oh, good morning. Thank you for the O.J. Yeah, no problem. And that funny french cheese, that's yours. This queen is lactose intolerant. C'mon in. Come, come, come in. Take a load off. I can come in your room?. If I invite you, yes. I heard from Kaleesha. What?. Did I get a call back?. No, I heard from Kaleesha that the two of you spent the evening together. No. She's not in your bedroom?. No. It's nothing to be ashamed of, Jérome. No, last night I was here a while and I went to West Hollywood spa. Why that little scamp. She was supposed to meet me at karaoke, and she texted me an hour later not to worry, that she was with you. It's not true. I don't like that crowd down on the boulevard. It's always the next John to the next score. I don't know why I take you into my heart. That's not me. I came to Los Angeles for to be an actor, not a tranny prostitute. And you think it's so very different?. Whatever. I came here with my daddy's inheritance from Paducah, Kentucky. I wanted the world to love me the way the he never had. And the only way to achieve that, in my mind, was up on the big screen But Hollywood wants its faggots behind the camera, not in front. Lucky for me, I was smart enough to put down roots in this shitty little neighborhood, which over the decades has become quite chic. I like your neighborhood, I like your house. At least I got a roof over my head. And the love... [phone ringing] I stopped looking for that a long time ago. Hi. I am here for pizza casting. You were supposed to be here by 4:.00. Oh, I know. I only got the call two hours ago and I took the bus. I came as soon as I could. Who's your agent?. My agent is Sarah, of Walter Norris Agency. Oh, yeah, she told us you were coming. Headshot and résumé?. I forgot, yeah. I don't have a résumé and headshot, no. Wait here. Come in. I've got a French guy here without a résumé. You're in luck. All right, all the actresses have gone home already, so I'll be playing your date. We're going to start in that corner over there, holding hands - we're on a date. Then we're going to walk to that corner over there. When we're done with that we're going to come to this table, sit, and we're going to share the product, Buongiorno Pizza. We're out of pizza... so we'll be eating rice cakes. But eat it like it's a hot, delicious piece of pizza. This is Thom. He'll be directing us. Hi. Any questions?. Yeah, do I say anything?. There's no dialogue, just walkin' and eatin'. OK, let's get your slate. I am Jérome Beaunez. My agent is Walter-- My agent is Sarah of Walter Norris Agency. Can we get your profiles, Jérome?. [whispers] Look at that nose. Opposite side, please. [whispers] He looks like Adrien Brody. OK, let's do some walkin' in Rome. And, action. And, cut! OK. We're gonna do it one more time. Cheryl, give us...Iess. Jérome, a little...more. Action! And, cut! Better, better. But Jérome, remember - you really love this person. OK?. It's not forced. It's just-- it's... It's just true love, OK?. Action! And cut! It was ridiculous - not even any dialogue. Considering you're not really italian, that's probably a good thing. Yeah. Does Sarah cast for movies, too, or just commercials?. I don't know. Yeah, maybe I should go back to Paris. C'mon now. Your big Hollywood film career is not gonna go anywhere if you do that. Yeah, I know. Look, tomorrow is Christmas Eve, so just forget about it, you know?. Yeah, I almost forgot the Christmas. This is the weather, I think. Yeah, I'm not really much of a holiday guy myself. They're so family-oriented. I'm so...not. Yeah, I understand. Uh, we can?. Here?. It's a-- Hell, yeah! It's a public beach. I should probably tell you something at this point - just so you... have all the information. I'm positive. I'm healthy and all that, but, you know - positive. How long have you been, uh... Since the mid-90s. The dawn of protease inhibitors. No. I'm going to ask, how long have you been selling the weed?. It's your job, right?. Yeah, it's my job. I used to be a hair stylist, actually. Now I still listen to peoples problems, I just make a hell of a lot more money and I never have to leave my apartment, except to go to the beach so... It's good, this. Can I buy a bag from you?. Here. Call it a free sample. The next one you buy. Why are you so nice to me?. Because you're sexy and French; I'm want to get in your pants. Thanks. No, for the bag, I mean. It's finished. Yeah. It's strange... I don't have a VlH. HlV in English. Because I have had much sex with many men. Yeah, me too. You know, it's just a thing. It's me. Yes, I'm going to Silver Lake. Don't have to. You can crash here... No strings attached. Thank you, Ross. Bon matin, Kaleesha. ca va?. I just had a dream about you. Oh, yeah?. We was in Paris and-- What you lookin' at, Jérome?. Listen, I want to fix my bedroom. Norma's door is closed... so I was thinking maybe you can help me?. Oh, no. I am not spending my Christmas Eve cleaning up that wreck of a room. That's your bag. It's too bad, because I have this. It could be fun. Oh, look. It's the food of your people. Oh, yeah, Café l'Etoile. There is a sexy waiter here. - Oh, yeah?. - Yeah. You've eatin' here before?. No. I cannot believe you have me doing manual labor. I do not do anything with 'man' in the word - not for free. You can come in, Kaleesha. Why are you so like this?. I just haven't been in this room in a while, that's all. Yeah, it's a dump. You have never sleep before here?. I have. Just not in a while, no. You knew the guy who was here before?. Joel. His name was Joel - a musician I met playing for tips on Hollywood Boulevard. It's through Joel I met Norma. Oh, and uh- - He was... a tranny chaser, you know. And, uh... so you two, uh... No...not really. I was in love with him though. [whispers] So was Norma. He just... He didn't exactly love himself though, you know?. Yeah, it's not easy, yeah. I can still feel him in here. I understand. It take a long time to paint a room. Child, please, who you tellin'?. And we just started... Dang. I was thinking... I have a new apartment in Paris. I haven't done any work on it. Oh, really?. A new apartment in Paris. That sounds so glamorous. It's not. The entire apartment is about the size of this room. And I am alone there. It's very depressing. Well, I know all about that. Where do you sleep when you don't sleep here?. With whoever is paying me to be there. Other friends, other mens. I've been known to sleep outdoors, too. You should sleep here, not outside. Is that an invitation?. Yeah, no. Here we go. Jérome, light me up, baby. Well, what do you think?. It's still empty, but, uh... It's as if he never lived here. Well, now it's Jérome that lives here. Or Kaleesha or whoever you want. No, no, no. It's fine. I just preferred how it was before. That's all. You prefer how it was before?. Quelle salope! You prefer how it was before?. It looks just the same now. All right, all right, all right, all right! Geeze, you ought to be an actress - you are a drama queen, Miss Edith Piaf. Who is that?. I worked hard on this room! Yeah, me too. Why don't you go wrap a Christmas present, sweet tits. I need to talk to Jérome. OK. Jérome, you did me a big favor, and I am grateful. You know I just have to catch up. How 'bout if I make it up to you?. I'll take us all out for Christmas dinner. OK?. Hmm?. # [laughing, singing] Jérome?. Jérome! It is you! What's up?. What are you doing?. I'm waiting for the bus. Get in, man, I'll give you a ride. Watch your back, though. This is Norma. This is Kaleesha. We are together, the three of us. Oh... Hey, I know you. You're the one that does the drag queen bingo thing. That's right, hot stuff. Are you one of my players?. Oh, no, no, no, no. And what are you doing in downtown?. I am making a little Christmas delivery, but I'm done, so get in. We can go to The Abbey or something. Oh, I like their apple martinis. Oh, girl, yes. Oh, I love those things. Oh, I would, but with Foxy it's so crowded. That's OK. Kaleesha don't mind no dog on top of her, right?. Yeah, it's with Norma I'm staying in Silver Lake. Oh, I'm sorry you didn't tell me you were staying with... The bus is coming. Look, it's nothing personal. I'm high. I get socially awkward when I'm high. No, you're a dick when you're high! And that is exactly why I cannot stand drag queens. Always drama! Get in. Come on. You do not want to take the bus. Hey, hey, hey! Yes...yes, I do. Merry Christmas! It's the wrong bus, but I'll take it. Sure, sugar, I can do six. You want to buy me a drink first?. I'll meet you anywhere in the 323. No, the corner is fine. All right, see you at six. Who is that?. Dimitri... My regular gig. He gives you money for... A blow job in his car. Eighty bucks and I don't have to swallow. But he like it better if I do, though. Oh, until then I'm outta' cash. You can spot me for a cup of coffee?. Oh, yeah, OK. Put that out. Yeah. I need to make money if I want to stay here. Oh, but you have to stay. You like it here, right?. Yeah, yeah, I like, but I don't have a green card. So?. Get a job waiting tables at, um, Café l'Etoile. But I'm not legal. You think all these people workin' here are legal?. I doubt it. But they are probably all Cuban. Why?. Because this is a Cuban cafe. So you think I could work under the table?. Look, all actors are waiters first. I mean, I would do it myself, but... You're right - it would suck. I'll be right with you. You can sit wherever you like. Ah! You don't remember me?. I thought you looked familiar. Did we... You worked on that Paramount shoot, right?. No! In the West Hollywood spa two nights ago. Oh, yeah... Oh, yeah. You're the French guy. Yeah. It's all comin' back to me now. I was just a tiny bit fucked up that night. Kenny!. Oh, I gotta get that order. Do you want anything to drink?. Yeah... Cafe is good, yeah. OK. [phone ringing] Norma, I need you to listen to a message for me. Honey, I'm gonna drink this glass of vino, and I've gotta run outta' here. Please, Norma. All right, dial her up, quickly. And you can open up that other bottle of vino, OK?. No, I prefer the nummy. (voice on phone) Hey Jérôme. You got the pizza gig. Jérome! - That's-- - Yeah, I know. That's incredible! You've only been here a week. This doesn't happen to people. Yeah, I understand. So what's the problem?. She said she needs my address, my-- Your social or your taxpayer lD. Listen, I gotta' get to bingo, all right?. We'll figure it out on the way over there. You're going to come with me, OK?. I've been waiting over here for 30 minutes! Where's my replacement bus at?. Yeah, ain't the bus fixed yet?. This girl's gotta go to work. You know what?. About that Walter Norris Agency... Just tell them your situation. Everything's gonna be just fine. It really will. Faggots! Good eye! God! But if she says, "You're not legal?. " Jérome, it's not like you just stormed over the border from El Salvador or anything. Besides, you can use my address. What?. I have an idea! You could use my identity. I'm a lapsed member of SAG. But then you'll belong to me, 'cause all your checks and residuals will come in my name. When's the bus gonna' be ready?. G-57. BlNGO! We got us a Bingo! Come on up here! There you go and what's your name, dear?. I'm Dale. You're Dale. Where you from, Dale?. I'm from New Jersey. New Jersey, oy.

There's so many actors and actresses here tonight. And some of them are even workin'. Jérome! Jérome! What's up?. You should have called me; I would have taken you. No, it's OK. I took the Rapid Bus and it's not too bad. Hey, I talked to Sarah. She told me you got that commercial. That's incredible. Yeah. You shoot tomorrow, right?. Tomorrow, yeah. She also told me that your real name is Norman and that you're American?. Ah, yeah. Whatever works, man. You talent?. I'm looking for-- Yeah, we spoke last night on the phone. I'm Jen, 2nd AD.

Thanks! It was really great working with you. Let's keep in touch. And Norman, I'll just get a final John Hancock from you, and then you are good to go. Can I get a copy?. Call the production company in a few weeks. They should be able to help you out with that. Is there anything else?. Nope. That's all I need. Welcome to Hollywood, Jérome! Good morning, sunshine. Hey, have you heard from Kaleesha?. You have tried to call her?. Well, she hasn't answered her phone in two days, and she's got me worried sick. It's OK, she's always come back, no?. How'd your commercial shoot go?. Oh, it was boring, in fact. - Oh, yeah?. - Yeah. I don't believe it will be a good commercial for pizza. Well, you'll, you'll have to tell me about it later. It's funny... When the weather is beautiful all the time, it's no longer special. Oh, Eugenio, this is Jérome. He's replacing Arturo. - Hola! - Hello. So if you have any questions, just ask Eugenio. He's the best. Thank you. Hey, I'm not done with that. Oh, my God! I'm sorry. It was an accident! What is wrong with you?. Look what you've done to my dress! I need to see a manager immediately! This is unbelievable! I am never... Why are you laughing at me?. - Eugenio?. - Uh huh?. Thank you for your help earlier with the waiter. That was funny. It's not a problem, man. You have done this job for how long?. Oh, this job?. Like four years. - Four years?. - Uh huh. But Ms. Lise, she say one day soon I can be a server. [knock on door] Yes?. Good morning, Norma. How are you?. Well, I was gonna come in here and yell at you for using my computer, but-- Yeah, yeah. I go back to Paris today. But I thought that you didn't have any money and that you wanted to stay. I already bought the ticket; It was a round trip. After everything that I have done for you, and Kaleesha is nowhere to be found... She's not going with you, is she?. I don't know where is Kaleesha. Tomorrow is New Year's Eve. What about your acting career?. You said from the start it was temporary. It always is. Thank you, Norma. Read my letter. [laughing] Release your soul... Release. Hello. I know you. I meet you at Spotlight, Hollywood. Nah, man. I'm sorry. I think you've mistaken me for somebody else Jérome?. Ah, Ross. Hey, what's up?. I was coming to see you. Is that my new star client, Norman/Jérome?. I have big plans for you, sweetheart. We're gonna have you on a soap by Valentine's Day. See you later. You going somewhere?. My plane leaves in four hours. Paris?. Yes, Paris, yeah. You comin' back?. I don't know. Maybe. We can smoke together before I go?. Yeah, of course. Come on. I'll give you a ride. Dear Norma, It is difficult for me to say goodbye because a big part of me doesn't want to leave Los Angeles. But I am no longer sure this life is for me. And besides, I still have some attachments in France. My decision to return is not a rejection of you or Kaleesha, or the idyllic life in Silverlake. I will always remember our Christmas together, and I thank you for letting me stay with you. You can keep all the money from the pizza commercial. It is in your name and I owe it to you. If I return to Hollywood, I will contact you immediately, of course. But I still love someone in Paris. And it will always be my home. I hope you understand. Please give Kaleesha the bedroom so she will stay off the streets. I wish you both a Happy New Year's. Hollywood, je t'aime... Jérôme Beaunez.
