«The Tramps» in planet war Don't run! Learn to never fool around with somebody else's girl! I didn't know she had so many boyfriends! Now we're gonna have to spend the night here! - They wait for us there! - This is full of gnats! - Some are two-story tall! - What would you rather do?! Spending the night here with the gnats... Or be shot by those people?! Look, it's you to blame, you started all this! I'll get you...! I'm scared...! Help! Fire! A flying turtle! Don't be afraid, I came for help. My planet is on a crisis. - It's a draw. Ours too. - Shut up, Zacarias! I am Flick, prince of planet Airos... Which is under the grasp of Zuco and his followers. Zuco has destroyed my people and is headed to the village... Where I'm staying with princess Myrna. Mr. "Flica", what we have to do with this skirmish? I need to take someone to help me. - My people has fled in fear. - And how can we help you? We're fighting for the brain computer... I have one half of the computer... And Zuco has the other half. Oh, I get it. So you give him your half... And keep his half. Everything gets fine! Count us in, prince Flick. We will help you. Yes, but... depends on the dough, huh? - That we will get. - Dough? Yes, dough. Cabbage, sugar... - Butter and egg, the Jack! - He means money. Our money is no good in your planet. But if everything goes well... And I get the other half of the computer... I'll give you each your weight's worth of gold. Swell! Can you imagine? Our weight in gold?! Mussum's butt only is enough to buy a whole state! That's right. So let's help the man. Count us in! Let's go. Easy, don't be afraid. This is Bonzo, my co-pilot. Mr. "Flica", I'll go only if I can take Duda, my car. Yeah, yeah... Princess Myrna, my fiancee, has been kidnapped. Yeah, yeah. The princess was kidnapped. The princess was kidnapped! Yeah, yeah. Zacarias, the princess was kidnapped. The princess was kidnapped! - Mine, strawberry flavored... - Oh, holy god. Antonio Carlos, the princess has been kidnapped. Leave the change in the drawer. Yeah, yeah... I know how to find the princess... Let's go. Prince Flick... what are you doing here? Igor... where's Zuco? And why would I tell the prince where Zuco is? Igor... where's Zuco? Igor, where is Zuco?! Igor, where is Zuco?! In the rocky region! I'm hungry, I'll stop here. And what are we gonna eat? We gonna eat sand? If I ate fruit, everyone would be all over me... Now if I ate sand, my stocks would plunge! I have food, here. Mara, you get more than anyone involved. Besides, we better be precautious. I was starving. I want it too! I want it... Your meal, Didi. Hold on! You can stop with that... hold on! Oh boy! There's nothing else for us to eat, here! But this meal has calories enough for a weak. But I want food to make my tummy get fat! You promised us our weight in gold! My chicken had too little salt in it... My "feijoada" even had "caipirinha" for starters... And piggies butties in the end. You're all adaptable, insecure, assumed! - Is that all, dude? - That's what you are! I wanna eat! Add some mass to my stomach! Keep on eating those pills of yours... I'll go get some food to fill me up. Be careful, Didi. This forest is dangerous! This isn't true! Ending up in a planet with no food! I am going crazy to fill myself up, throwing in some chow! And they eat a pill. Why would I want some pill...! You don't fool me. I have this stomach to fill up! What...? Imagine the omelet I'm gonna do! My god, this is a giant sparrow! There's a bunch of soldiers coming after us! Let's go. Mr. "Flica"... what is this place? We've fallen into a cave in the magnetic zone... What planet are you from, Didi? It's funny, up to a little while ago... I'd say from Ceará... Now you ask which planet I'm from... What a progress! My planet is called Earth. That one! Here we call it Star UV-49. There are millions like it in this galaxy. Look, Didi, from the way you talk and your pose... I'm sure you must be a prince or a king. - Am I right? - Yeah, yeah... And I also know that when you left Earth... Your subjects didn't want you to leave. Am I right, Didi? Didi, I have a feeling that people are happy there... With safety, peace and serenity. Am I right, Didi? I think I should make a joke, but... Prince Flick... If you don't hand over your half of the brain computer... Princess Myrna will die. This is Zuco's decision. The meeting for the computer's delivery will be tomorrow... At noon, at the center of the West zone. You and your followers should go unarmed... It's the computer or the princess' death. Zuco wants it this way and so shall it be. - Mr. prince Fricka? - Flick. Zuco's people don't know I have this gun, right? I don't know that weapon. And a deal is a deal. Give me that! Hey guys! I found a guaya tree! - What's that? - Banana with tangerine. I found a guaya tree! - Guaya tree? What's that? - Guaya with papaya. Look, an apple-pine tree! - Apple-pine tree? What's that? - Apple with pineapple! Watch out! The invisible men! I'm stuck! What about me?! Come back! You weak! I'm stuck! Abominable creatures! - Didi stayed there! - Thank god, one less. No way... we have to go back and save Didi! We have to reach the West zone before noon... Or the princess dies! With all due respect to mr. "Princick", there... I'd rather see her dead than Didi. - Let's go back and save him. - We can't go back! Here we are a kind of mercenarios! Right, we have to found our mercery. We are here to help the prince and his people... If we can do that he'll give us our weight worth of gold. Let's go. Where is the computer? And the princess? Now you will all die the primitive way! Now that I have the other half of the brain computer... I'll have control over this galaxy! Seize them! General Hardshell... come here! Take me out! I'm scared! Let me go, you traitors! Release me! Let me out of here! Help... Let me go! Hurray for prince Flick! Zuco... tell me where princess Myrna is. Zuco! Tell me where the princess is! As we took her mask's mould off, she disappeared! Are you nuts, man?! Do you want to stay here, in this planet?! Yeah, yeah. And what are you gonna do here, Didi? There is a whole bunch of girls, back on Earth... - More women than men! - I was never happy, back there... At least I have some hope... around here. Are you sure of what you are doing? Sure! I know, I'll miss you... And our friendship built on life's roughness... Fifteen years of beating us up... But it was bound to happen anyway. Alright, if you want it this way... right? - Goodbye. - No, no goodbyes. Or else there's no there's no substance. See you around. This is me... wherever I get into, I have to win. And those three back on Earth, they can manage alright. - Sure! - They are very smart. - This is cool. - Beautiful... I like it. I've never been in here before. When we get married I'll buy us one of these. What's wrong, Flick? Zuco confessed that... When he was doing princess Myrna's mask mould... There was a physical disintegration and... No more princess? Doh't be sad, I too have lost three great friends. But I found happiness on another planet. Things didn't end up so well for me, Didi. But you can't give up, you have the power in your hands! You've fought for it! Your people is counting on you! Let's cheer up, you're not alone! You can even count on... your prime minister. I am not sad, just worried for the vanishing of Myrna. These are the laws of my planet... With the princess gone... Her older sister will take her place. Wait for me! Loya, I don't know on which star you are... But it was great dreaming you. Wake up! Watch out, Flick, wake up! Antonio Carlos! - Zacarias! - It's Zuco, it's Zuco! - What Zuco?! - Hold on... Have you guys dreamed the same as I did? - I think so. - I think so. I dreamed of chicks from other planets. Me too. Let's get out of here, 'cause this place is haunted. Gold! Gold! Gold! Gold...! Even the car has turned gold! Look over there!
