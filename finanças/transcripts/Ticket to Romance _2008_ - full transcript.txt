LOVE That's about it. - Yes? - Can't it be put much simpler? It's a perilous journey where all must be lost in order to win everything. It's a spiritual dimension where he and she can meet in a romantic utopia. The words are the stepping stones of the journey. Yes, I insist - - on being a romantic idiot to reach the true essence of poetry. Love. We can only offer teaching jobs for your unique qualifications. - I just want to get started quickly. - A full-time job in Nuuk, Greenland. Or... A temporary position at the Center for Adult Education, CAE in Korsor. - Korsor? - Nuuk or CAE. Turn right after 1 km. Turn right after 200 m. This doesn't look right. We're driving on the waterfront. - Clever device, isn't it? - Yeah. And it's global, too! Fuck. Now we're moving... That's it. - That's enough. Get out. - I don't understand. What don't you understand? You were groping her b-b-boobs. Dickhead! - He didn't do anything. - What? Don't you think I saw him groping your b-b-boobs? Hi. Rasmus Iversen. I'm here about the room. - Oh. - Hi. You're a handshaker. Follow me. It's upstairs. This is it. This is the kitchen. And over here is the john and bath. TV. Good morning. My name is Rasmus Iversen. Good morning. My name is Rasmus. We're all poetic imaginations. Hello. My name is Iversen. We're going on an exciting journey. I'm in a bit of a hurry. I'm going to CAE. The Center for Adult Education. - C.A.E.? - Yes. - Is Track 12 already open? - I'm staying there. You don't look like someone, who lives in a bar. - C.A.E. in Korsor. As short as it gets. - How much for the jaunt? - 27 kroner. Are you the new teacher? - I'm starting today. We've had four substitutes in three weeks. It's a drag. - I'm Signe. - Rasmus. - You're my Danish teacher. - Don't you drive a cab? I drive a cab and take Danish classes. This one's on the house. I have a customer waiting. - Can I give you a tip? - I wouldn't say no. - Morning. - Morning. No, no. Poul, stop it. Yes, see you. See you at the staff meeting. Fine, Poul... Jesus Christ. Yes? - Hi. Welcome. - Rasmus Iversen. - Ulla Jonsdottir. - The land of the sagas. No. I'm from Tollose. But my father was an Icelander. I was born the day the Surtsey volcano rose from the sea. You have the crash course. Two years' curriculum in one year. - It'll feel like living with them. - Some intensive work will be nice. They've had a couple of substitutes that didn't work out. - But they're motivated? - They aren't as well-read as you are. But they're adults who've chosen to take the class. - That's a good approach. - Dreams and ambitions. Sure they have... You're just the ticket. If you need anything, ask Birthe. Here's your class list and executive order. And a master key. - That opens every door. - Except the one to my office. We are allowed some secrets, aren't we? This way. Rasmus, that's your classroom. Have fun. Would you mind holding this? There we go. There are 139 school days left. Then we'll be spared all the bother and ignorance. - My name is Rasmus. - Aage Damgaard. I wanted to be a bookseller, but Dad said: - "Teach German and history." - Those are interesting subjects. Interesting? Nothing's more boring than German and history. What's this? You're sweating. Your stomach is in knots and your memory lets you down, right? Your mouth is dry. You're out of here in four weeks tops. Lucky bastard. Morning. Hi. We're going on an exciting journey, not a journey into the world. But an inner journey, into ourselves. - We're... - What's your name? Good question. Oops. Rasmus Iversen. Rasmus. We'll be reading older works - - such as Holberg, Oehlenschl√§ger, Brorson... Some of the modern writers like Rifbjerg, Nordbrandt - - Ib Michael, Helle Helle, Strunge... ... a notion of coherence transgresses the self's limited understanding of... I'll digress to the poetic imagination and Romanticism, which is my major. Woman... Romantic longing. - Yes? - I'm afraid I have to leave. Sorry. Longing for the reunion of the sexes. The relationship to the concept of love. The universal spirit that lies dormant in a stone. Let's take a five-minute break. I need five minutes, so let's do that. - Wilhelm Garde. - Rasmus Iversen. Commander at the naval station in Korsor. I'm retired. - You have a PhD., correct? - Correct. Ole. Signe, Rasmus Iversen is our new Danish teacher. PhD. - Where is everybody? - We're taking a break. In the middle of class? Take ten. I'll come and get you. I have a dentist's appointment. Let's call it a day. See you tomorrow. 08: 10. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. - Okay. - Goodbye. - Car 66 is free. - Nothing right now. Car 66, copy that. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you still busy? - Not as busy as this morning. Can I see 200 kroner's worth of Korsor? You can see it for 350. That should do you nicely. - That's including a tip? - Of course. I'd like that. Here you go. 350 kroner's worth of Korsor, tip included. Korsor, Halskov and the bridge between them. People here are snobs about Halskov. - Where do you live? - Out by the bridge. There's the naval station. The church. The bridge to Halskov. And C.A.E. is over there. I worked at their day care center and the after-school center. - And at the youth club. - So you like children. I'm nuts about them. - Why are you taking Danish? - I want to be a midwife. Do you like fish cakes? - Thanks. We'll sit out back. - Fine. - Do you have children? - No. I have to find the right man. - Your lost half. - What? Your lost half. In the Romantic Period they thought we'd once been one sex. And now we're constantly looking for our female or male half. Sounds lovely. And crazy. Do you believe that? Of course. I'm a romantic idiot. - Have you found your lost half then? - No, not yet. Well, at least you've found the job of your dreams. Yes. Actually I was hoping to get a job in research. - What kind of research? - Romanticism. - Can you do research in that? - Sure. That's what I did. But now I need to pay off my student loan. - Why do you drive a cab? - To avoid a student loan. - 350 kroner for you. - Thanks. Take care. - Hi. - Hi. - Weren't you in my Danish class? - Yes. - I'm sorry I had to leave. - That's okay. Lots of people did. - Are you going in for a beer? - No, I live upstairs. - Did John rent the apartment to you? - Yes. Do you know him? He's my husband. - I see. Hi. - Welcome. 6, 7, 8 withdrawals, Rasmus. That won't do. What did you say to them? I went over the curriculum and talked about some modern authors. Then I mentioned poetic imagination. - You didn't, did you? - Yes. That's Greek to them. You have to relate to their lives. - Their lives? - Forget about culture horizons. And aesthetic consciousness. Prepare them for literature. - In a language they understand. - Yes. I have to find an approach. Damn right. Tease them a bit. Surprise them. Seduce them. Eight withdrawals. That's a record. You're out in a week. - Morning. - Morning. Sorry I'm a bit late. The principal summoned me. - Ole? Signe? - Yes. - Wilhelm? Bettina? - Yes. - Daniel? - He's coming. He was sick yesterday. Right. I'd like to start today by asking you to tell me about yourselves. Good morning. My name is Rasmus. - Fuck. - Fuck what? You, motherfucker. My name is Fuck. Don't you understand? - Aren't you a Danish teacher? - Your name is Danny. Shut the fuck up. Call me Fuck. - Okay. Fuck. - You're thinking: Why are you here? Okay. Why are you here? - I asked first. - You did. Me? "I'm me. I'm the guy who's me. And myself is me, not you." "If someone else was me, you could be me." "It's sublime that I'm singular in the first person." "It's sad for those who are no one at all." "I'm glad I'm me." "If no one was glad to be me, it would be sad to a great degree." "If we're like a pawn in a game and the Lord asks us to agree -" "- he asks who we should be then of course I want to be..." - Me! - If you're me, then who am I? - Knock it off. I'm Fuck. - Unfortunately I didn't write that. - It's a poem by Halfdan Rasmussen. - Where the hell is he from? Denmark. "I was born there, it's my home." "From there my roots and there my world extend." "YOU Danish tongue." "With you my heartbeats so sweetly mend... blend." Hans Christian Andersen. - Tell me why you're taking Danish. - Hell if I know. Besides Danny, does anyone else wonder why he's here? Yes? I want to be a real estate agent. Finding the right house for people. - I just think it's interesting. - Yes. - Anyone else? - Well... Poems. I'm very interested in language. I'm going to be a midwife. - Ole? - The municipality merge. There's been some staff redeployment in the police. So I wanted to improve my Danish. Especially writing. - So you're unemployed? - No, I just have time for reeducation. - You're a policeman? - Yes, but I was in administration. Okay. Interesting. "YOU Danish tongue" writes Andersen. Why does he write that? Because he's familiar with Danish. That's why we're here. We relate to other people through language. We express ourselves and talk about our dreams and desires. Who we are and what we're afraid of. We're immersed in words. - You're talking out your ass. - Yes. But how? For tomorrow I'd like you to write a poem each. Can't you recite a poem? A beautiful one to inspire us. "Sophie, I can't give you a tiara for your head." "Or a gold ring for your finger. You can have a kiss on your thigh." "And a smack on the ass that will linger." Holger Drachmann. Let the words out. Are you out buying provisions, too? I can cook five dishes. This is number three. - I'm having number eleven today. - Goodness. - From the pizzeria. - Oh. - I'm just buying coffee. - Okay. I felt like a steak after an inspirational day at school. - Good idea. - I'll join you for coffee and red wine. This is where the train ferries docked. Now it's like this... Wow. You can see what they're having for dinner. I'm not spying. It's my old house. Your house? My wife said it was too big to keep up, so we bought this place. We retired in April and wanted to enjoy life. First, a trip around the world in 180 days. But then she died. Now I live here - - between my old house and my old workplace. - Cheers! - Cheers. That's the way it goes. I'll cook the steaks, and you can open the wine. Right you are. The bridge is mesmerizing. Lights floating in the night. People on a journey. Let me show you the admiraless. Where should I put her? I don't dare drill holes in these virginal walls. You were a beautiful couple. You suited each other. Sister ship isn't the right term. But we were from the same shipyard. Everything fell into place when she came into my life. There's a myth that says that Man is looking for his lost half. She was certainly my better half. - Haven't you found your lost half? - No, mostly fourths. Maybe there was a third. There's only one true half. It's not too late for you. - Or for you. - Yes, it is. But it's never too late for a cognac. Man overboard. - Is it my fault? - Yes. It's a bar. I can't ask the guests to be quiet because of your homework. - I can't think in that racket. - Why should you think at all? - The kids shouldn't grow up in a bar. - Real estate agent, my ass! - You couldn't sell the baby carriage. - You insulted all the callers. One hysterical woman who wouldn't pay the price. Who sold that baby carriage? You or me? What's this you're selling now? "Standing in the night thinking about what I've done..." - Give me that. - "With disdain I feel I'm in chains." Chains? I work my ass off, but you like the money. Half those assholes owe you money. You'll never get it. You're scared. You're afraid of Ronny and Ib and afraid of getting your ass kicked. You've always been afraid. Now give me that poem. Just take off. All you think about is yourself. Get out. Then you can go and f-f-fuck somebody. - Why does it have to be like this? - Yes, why? I'm sick of it, too. Who would like to read their poem first? Fuck has a cock that works like a Glock. Yes, a witty little verse. But I think you can do better. - So it's bad or what? - A good poem is more than rhyme. Ole. - Mine rhymes a bit, too. - Fine. - Let's hear it. - Yeah. Poem. You were so small and inept - - that I almost wept. Now you're big and cranky - - maybe you need a spanking. Like back in my school I was hit for being a fool. But you are my daughter your laugh - like cool water. - That rhymes, so it's bad, right? - He uses the past and present. Feelings and contrasts. We smile and laugh. And chick rhymes with dick. Is that all it takes? No, but he's done well. Let's continue. Wilhelm. There is light in the darkness. The sea is paved with staring eyes. Who sails alone at night on the big ship? An old man without a straight course or a nautical chart. Without the sea... That's as far as I got. It was lovely, Wilhelm. Some powerful words. Yes. We like powerful language. I'll read some powerful words to you. "Stone skies, wind houses." "Air cellars, rain hearts, cliff mouths, river stomachs." "Snow lungs, coal brains." Inger Christensen wrote that. If you want coal pussy, call Black-Suzy. - Stop it, Fuck. - It's better when it rhymes, right? - How about fuck Fuck? - Signe says fuck Fuck. That's called alliteration. There we go. Using the same consonants. - F-F. So you're a poem. - A poem? I just want some pussy. You can have some Oehlenschl√§ger. He writes the following in "Advice for a young husband". "There! Between her marble thighs you can hear her heart and sighs." "Press against her breast in bliss and steal from her the longest kiss." "But if a blush is on her skin, then gently stick a finger in." And he goes on to say... "Do not shorten this sweet crime, but give yourself the best of time." "In order not to lose your guile, take a break... once in a while." "When a tickling in your sword no longer can be ignored -" "- thrust your scepter in the mare, and let hair press against hair." "Spray your manly juices deep in the cave where life's asleep." - Adam Oehlenschl√§ger. - My man. I understood everything. Sometimes it's good to read something you don't understand. - Hi. - Hi. - What the hell is that? Porn? - It's Eckersberg. - A painter from our golden age. - P-p-porn from the golden age. - What'll be? - Can I have something to eat? Something to eat? Bettina isn't here, so... The sign says "always". Damn. - Hi. - Hi, Bettina. - John? - I'm in the kitchen, aren't I? Oh, Luigi, now I'm writing again Do you remember when you were my special friend? We were kissing in the gondolas And you caressed me fondly Remember you said that I was yours? And you sang sonatas in the clear moonlight Oh, Luigi Moonlight Oh, Luigi See Venice and die You were so damn hot when you said to me May I invite you To dinner at my papa's pizza place? I sighed and got red in the face Fellini was playing his violin And you sang sonatas in the clear moonlight Oh, Luigi moonlight Oh, Luigi see Venice and die - The pickle is organic. - Who ordered a cab? That'll be me. What's going on? - I'm not taking him, John. - I'm going to hurl. Don't let it out yet. - Can I offer you a sandwich? - No thanks. - They're organic. - Really? I can't breathe in here. - Can I offer you some fresh air then? - Sure. This is my secret hideaway. No one ever comes here. It's absolutely awesome. It's a good place to have a think. Do you want to have children? I'm not sure I'm ready. I mean in principle. With the right woman and circumstances - - it could, in principle, be possible. - There. - What the hell is that? - It looks like a sick chicken. - It's by Michael Kvium. He's trying to portray nudity without any ideals. I don't understand why we have to look at that. I think that art is always about sex, violence and death. - I guess it's symbolic. - It's a weird way of seeing the world. What does it have to do with Danish? We look at a picture and talk about it. We use language. We develop our ability to see and describe things. - That won't improve my spelling. - That's how men treat women. They slam them on the butcher's table and hack away at them. Yeah. Now my sword is tickling. Ring! 2:45 p.m. Time's up, buddy. It's the weekend. I want three pages on imagery on Monday. I'm having a bunch of brews and a big fat joint. - Have a nice weekend. - You too. Have a nice weekend. What about you? Aren't you going home? Give me a beautiful poem as a send-off. "Between the two of us there's a magical tie." "A dream, a hope, a castle in the sky." "Without fear for no more must we roam." "Meeting you felt like coming home." - Who wrote that? - I don't recall the idiot's name. - Any plans for the weekend? - Correct papers, read and prepare. Come over tomorrow. At 6:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.? - Yes. - You're early. - Yeah. - Hi. - Welcome. - Hi. - This is Camilla. I've heard good things about you. I'm glad. Are you her sister? Girlfriend. Okay. - I don't know who drinks or... - We both do. We share. We're going swimming, and you're coming, too. - Didn't you know that? - No. Come on! It's this way. Hurry up, Rasmus. - Come on! - Come on, Rasmus! A father? You're asking me if I want to be a father? Yes. - We want to know our child's father. - So it won't be so clinical. Rasmus, you're the man we've been looking for. - A poetic, intelligent man. - With a good heart and mind. Your grandfather was a doctor. Your father is a biochemist. - And your mother is a lawyer. - It doesn't get any better. - But... they're divorced. - Good genes. And balls. In a figurative sense. - Camilla and I have discussed it. - The three of us are a perfect match. From a genetic point of view. I'm very honored. And very confused. I'll be having the baby. You'll have the baby. What about afterwards? - What about me and the baby? - You're just the donor. So it's just a drop in a cup? No, not at all. We'll find our finest glass. Rasmus, I really want a baby. Yes. Yes. I just have to... To think about it. - I can't just... - Of course not. You should think about it. - I don't want to pressure you. - No. But the thing is, I'm ovulating in a few days - - so if you agree... - It's a big deal. - I'll only be the donor. Can you live with having a kid run around with your genes? I've thought about it. Are you in love with her? I would've liked to have a child, but we couldn't. - Signe dreams of having a baby. - What do you dream about? To me a child is about duty and responsibility. It's family. If you ask me, don't do it. Here is our finest glass. - If you need anything... - Just say the word. No... Signe? I'll need a cup. Of course. It's a bit awkward. - Here. - Thanks. Wait a minute. Keep the door open and stay there. We'll play a little game. It's... - No, it's... - Sorry. I'll leave quickly. It's not... Sorry, I wish I could. Hi. Lie down. Lie down. Close your eyes. Lie still. Lie still. Close your eyes. Lie still. Thank you. Your last exercise is to find words ending with "ent". - Tashkent. - No place names. Movement. Commitment. Ailment. Afterwards words that end with "ance". Forbearance, tolerance, appearance. - Smutment. - Smutment? - Extortment. - It's called extortion. - Abridgement. - Enlargement. - Abstinent. - Achievement. - Befuddlement. - Yes. - Self-sufficient. - How do you spell that? I'd like to talk to you after class. I wanted to say that we should be professional about this. I'm a teacher, you're a student. So meeting in private, taking walks... You're right. Otherwise we'd be like a couple. And that's not the idea. Then there's all the hetero, homo, lesbian... ism... thing. - I'm glad you see it that way. - What way? That we go to school as if nothing had happened. Yes, right. Obviously. - Bye now. - Bye. Right. That's what we'll do. Focus on the work. You're exactly as I'd hoped you'd be, Rasmus. Absolutely. THE BABY BOOK - What enjoyment and amusement. - Disconcertment. I've become obsessed with those words. I repent. - It's good that you're into language. - I'd like you to meet my family. - This is my wife, Kate. - Hello. Rasmus is my teacher. This is my daughter, Trine. Shake the man's hand. And this is Hugh. Yes. Hi. - Ole's been saying "ent" for days. - You're my contentment. Thanks. - Come on, Dad. - Alright, alright. I'd better be getting on. See you tomorrow in school. - Is this a bad time? - Where should I hang her? Where should I hang her? I can't go back to red wine. Maybe you should put her away until she tells you where to hang her. You think I drink too much. All these books are about war, tactics, maneuvers and battles. And then one morning, we're lying there together. She looks me in the eye. And you know the time has come. She's very calm. And I'm about to... A soldier without a war. Isn't that ridiculous? As a commander I'm out of the game. My time as a husband is over. War, love. Boom! No... It's never too late for a cognac, is it? Then Little Red Riding Hood ran home and promised her mother - - always to take the direct path to C.A.E. in Korsor. Yes. Thanks. Thanks to Rasmus' Danish class. That's it for tonight. Now there's dancing. Cheers, everyone. - You're a good dancer. - It dances well. - It? - As if we're one body. - Actually we're three bodies. - What? - We're three bodies. - Three? A man, a woman and... - Are you pregnant? - Yes. - That's absolutely fantastic. - Rasmus. Dear, sweet Rasmus. Hi. There you are. I'm borrowing him. I think one should always be a bit in love. If I'm not in love, I get restless, Rasmus. Okay. Come with me. I want to show you something. Is something wrong? - I'm a bit drunk. - That's alright. No, no, Ulla. - Let's not do this. - Yes. No, we're not doing it. Fine. That's fine. But I do think it's a bit shitty of you, Rasmus. You're into it, and you get me all excited. We're adults. You're just a scared little Dane, who isn't up for anything after all. I think it's a bit mean. That's what I think. Stay here for two minutes. I'll go now, and then you can go. That was just so mean. - Come. We have to celebrate. - I'd rather go home to Camilla. I'm tired. See you. - I'll be heading home now. - Have one for the road. Cheers. Goodnight. There's our scared little Dane. Shouldn't you go home to the Sandman, dear Rasmus? Shouldn't you go home to the Sandman, dear Rasmus? It's Rasmus. - Hi. - Good evening. Is something up? She's having my baby, and I'm head over heels in love with her. And drunk. You're wearing your uniform. Why are you wearing your uniform? I have company. - Who? - Birthe. From school. She wanted to see me in my vestments. Are you in love, too? - You think I screwed up. - Correct. Yes. - I'll go home. - It will pass. I won't let it. - Signe speaking. - You're everything I dream about. As a woman, as a person. As a body, as a soul. What do you want? Can't we meet? There's no harm in meeting. But what do you want, Rasmus? We have feelings for each other, Signe. I can't be wrong about that. What do you want me to do? You don't have to be interested in men, just in me. They cut my breasts and around my sex. Small, bloody gashes. Wings sprouted on my invisible back. You have to look at your listeners. Get our attention. One was a punk-rocker, the other a dental assistant. And very sensible. - The big sister tries to find... - Look up at us. She looked at me before. - I can't look at everyone at once. - Yes, you can. That's the point. Look at all of us, so we feel you're telling a story, not just reading aloud. Okay? Go ahead. The big sister tries to find her little sister, who's disappeared in... - You have to look at us! - I'm looking. - You haven't looked at me once. - Give her a break. She has to get our attention. She has to look at me. We're looking at each other. There's contact. Go ahead. I'll talk to her. Stop! Are you alright? - Should we go to the hospital? - No. - Are you looking at me? - Yes. A whole life can be lived in one single tiny moment. Once you've had that moment, you live on and are changed. Then you know you've lived. You've experienced love. And that something makes sense. That's how I feel about you. You're that moment. I just wish - - that the moment would go on and on and on. A moment that is ours. - Ouch! - I'm so sorry. Don't worry about it. I won't be using it much anymore. Camilla, I thought you were coming tomorrow. I missed you. - We fell asleep. We didn't mean to. - Then what is the meaning of this? - I'm in love with Signe. - Any fool can see that. Any fool can see that it's something special when you've made a baby. I wanted to tell you. I just wanted to be sure... - How did you get pregnant? - I went to see Rasmus that night. - And you fucked him? - Just the one time... We had an agreement, and then you fucked the asshole. - This is much more than sex. - Shut up. Are you in love with the asshole? In love with that disgusting asshole? - Stop calling him an asshole. - Get rid of it. - I won't. - You have to. - It's not up to you. - Yes, it is! Get rid of it now! Good morning. Sorry I'm late. We're ready. - Good. We're going to begin... - With the Modern Breakthrough. Yes, exactly. Romanticism ends or concludes with the Modern Breakthrough. Now authors bring problems up for discussion, as Brandes said. Wasn't it about marriage and the role of women? True. As in "A Doll's House" where a woman leaves her children. - What the hell is wrong now? - I'll find out. I hate throwing up. Do you think they know I'm pregnant? I have a teacher who's impregnated a student and lives with her. - We have a special relationship. - I'm a lesbian. - Rasmus is just the donor. - But you're in a relationship. You can't get out of this one. - Getting a student pregnant. - How does everyone know? There are no secrets in Korsor. I'm afraid I might get fired. Camilla and I have wanted to have a baby for a long time. Rasmus was the perfect donor. - And he agreed. - Being a dyke isn't illegal. A teacher mustn't have sexual relations with a student. - Does Damgaard know that? - Let's stick to the point. - Did they fire you? - It'll be decided at a staff meeting. - I bet we'll be merged with Slagelse. - Will we get a new teacher? - What about our exam? - I don't know. I'm sorry, but I not allowed to teach you anymore. I've traveled through Asia, Australia and South America. Maybe we should just run away. If I pay 3000 a month till March 2022 - - I'll have paid off my student loan. Then we can travel. - Does it hurt? - It's as if... A bottle of champagne was opened in my stomach. It's bubbling. We've talked about this moment so many times. Maybe you should call her. Hi, this is Camilla. I can't take your call, but leave a message. There's a clear division between the personal and the professional. In spite of Rasmus' testimony, I insist he be fired. The executive order doesn't say being a donor is illegal. Discretion and morals. There aren't rules for everything. - You should be glad about that. - I don't know what you're on about. - Of course not. - Thanks, Damgaard. I'd better leave. What are you playing? I'll go inside. - Signe. - I'm just getting my clothes. You're an amazing woman, and I'm the father of your child. And that's enough. It's enough. Let me open it... Let's go. I thought you were a couple. We were. For a moment. - Where to? - Yes... - Back to reality. - And where's that? - In Korsor. - You mean Halskov. People get them mixed up. And I can see that, but Korsor... Could we just go? And be quiet... that would be nice. "If all kings should proceed in their power and mettle -" "- they could not put a leaf on a nettle." What do you think of Brorson's use of mettle and nettle? I haven't read his shit - - but mettle nettle sounds like humpty dumpty big time. Rasmus. - Will you get out of here! - I can't let my students down. - You already did. - I fell in love, Ulla. If we don't listen to love when it whispers, what should we listen to? The executive order? I forgot my responsibility, yes. But I'd like to make up for it. Call the directorate, the Ministry - - or the Coast Guard. I don't care. I'm teaching. I expect you to pass. All of you. So we got to the Modern Breakthrough. Wilhelm, will you call Signe and tell her that classes continue? A DOLL'S... Bettina. - I don't dare. - You must. You can't see it's sick that I keep being a chick... Fuck that clock that once again ran amok. Very nice. - Do I ask her? - Ask anyone. Who am I? You can't ask... Only yes or no questions. - Is it fiction? - Yes. - Hanne-Vibeke Holst? - You cheated! - How did you know that? - You used your cell phone. Sorry, I won. You'll be in room 2. You have one hour's preparation. Then I'll come for you. - And the text? - "Fear." Christ, he looked pale. He'll be fine. - What the hell? - I can't do it. Yes, you can. Come on, Ole. Get in there. Aarestrup's "Fear". Rhythmic sentences. Assonance. - Alliteration and consequences. - What should I say? Imagine that the poem bursts inside you. Like bubbles in a river. Some kind of meaninglessness. "In a moment we'll be apart like the berries all a-shiver." "In a moment we'll be gone like the bubbles in a river." When have you met bubbles in your life? Something that bursts. Falls apart. Rhythmic sentences. Alliteration. Assonance. Meaninglessness. Can you be a little more specific? The poem explodes. Tell us what the poem reminds you of. A normal Sunday. I see my four-year-old daughter out on the ice. It's very quiet. Nothing is moving. It's a long way to crawl, but you want to. And she's sinking. She mustn't die. Pull her out of the freezing water, screaming. I feel her blue lips on my mouth. I blow. She looks up at me. And now I can't go to work because I want to be near her. She just smiles and has forgotten all about it. Very good, Ole. Let's delve into the text. Here he comes. Ole... You got an A. When we dug into the text, just fine. Congrats. You're my first graduate. Thanks. Bettina, you got a 7, which corresponds to a C. You rambled on, but you got a 4. You have more than just passed. Thanks. Now we just have Wilhelm and Signe left. I think the lady should go first. Come in and pick a question. Then we'll break for lunch. You picked a traditional ballad. "Agnete and the Merman". - Sorry. I'm in pain. - When is your due date? In three weeks. I'll be fine. In your opinion, does Agnete end up being happy? Thanks, Rasmus. He looks like you. I'll get a vase for the flowers. Hi. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Look at those tiny fingers! My goodness. - Congratulations. - Thank you. There's a lot to celebrate. Congratulations on your graduation. - Except Wilhelm. - No worries. I'll be back next year. Congratulations, everyone. And to Signe and Camilla. And to you, Rasmus. Let's give three cheers for Rasmus. Very quietly. We'll whisper. Hooray, hooray, hooray. Hooray! Blow out the candle, Emil. Well, Rasmus, how do you like university life in Lund? - It's not Korsor. - No. - I'm glad you came. - I've been looking forward to it. So you've missed us? No. I never do. - How about you? How are you? - I'm ovulating today. Emil should have a little sister. What does Camilla think? She thinks we should get it over with. Have you talked about how many children you want? A lot. Well, let's get it over and done with then... That doesn't mean we have to rush things. Lie still. Be quiet. - And close your eyes. - Okay. Lie still, will you?
