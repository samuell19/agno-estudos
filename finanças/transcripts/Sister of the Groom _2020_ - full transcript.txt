He said it was love at first song. I still can't believe they changed their wedding date so last minute just so they could get married on the holiday of soul mates. I didn't even know there was such a thing as a Jewish Valentine's Day. Yeah. Clearly Clemence just found out about it, too. We'll still find a way to celebrate your big birthday this weekend, the big 4-0. Four... oh. Know what I mean? Come on, babe. I really just need to figure out a way to do the surgery. You look amazing. I think I look old. You look hot. What's happening with working for your brother at Radica? Liam's not committing to me. Really? I mean, he has several firms competing for the job, but I'm pretty sure that when he sees my creation, it's gonna blow his mind. Oh, good job, babe. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Fuck! Stop looking at your phone, babe. Sorry, the guys on my desk are texting. Oh, the fund's down another 18% this month. What are we gonna do if it doesn't turn around soon? All right, let's not worry about that right now, okay? They're in the studio, right? Right, but I'm gonna change first. We don't have time for that before dinner starts. I'm not gonna meet my future sister-in-law and her whole family for the first time looking like this. The itinerary card says casual chic. I don't know why you can't let me have five minutes - to get ready. - I just wanna... - They're fine, they're talking. - I know they're fine, - but we're so late. - Doesn't matter. It would take five minutes. Listen, five minutes turns into ten minutes. Bienvenue. - Hey! - Hi. Hey, sister. Yay! Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Hey. - Ethan. - Come here, buddy. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. - Kissing both cheeks? - Nice to meet you. I'm so psyched you guys are here. We are so sorry we're late, man. Oh, yeah, you gotta do the seaplane next time, skip the traffic. Yeah. - It was a crazy trip. - You look so different. I just don't even recognize you. Yeah, it's vintage Hermes. Don't you think he just looks so sexy with it? Merci, my little... - Oh, boy. - So sexy. - Sexy. Oh. - Très chic. Yeah. And your hair, did you straighten it? Yeah, it was a little frizzy before so they've relaxed it a little. Oh, they relaxed it. Just a little. Relax about it. Okay, I'll relax about it. It's getting late. I think we should start. I just need like five minutes 'cause I spilled in... - I spilled coffee. - He did, and it is really sticky and uncomfortable. - So I'm just gonna be... - No, no, you can change later. - We're so excited. - Yeah. - Come on in, you guys. - Let's go introduce you to everyone. This is gonna be the most fun. This is my papa, Philibert. Such a pleasure to meet you. Liam has a very pretty sister. I know. Liam told me that Philibert - was a famous comedian in France. - Really? Papa had a very well known TV show. It's called, "Gag Current." - Can I watch it? - It's in French, it's never been translated. Oh. Je parle un peu francais. - Did I get that right? - So far. Then you have to check it out. - I will. - I once consulted with a TV writer for a show they were writing about an architect. Are you an architect, mon chéri? - Oui. - Fantastique. Well, I'm getting back into it now more that our kids are older. I brought the North Island drawings to show you. Where are the little ones? Oh, well, they're at camp. - Yeah. - In Michigan. They were supposed to come, but the timing didn't work out with the new wedding date. - Oh, no. - It's a shame. We really wanted to meet them. Yes, I wanted them to be here. Yes, we did. But that's what they look like. Aw. So, over there, there is my mom Suzette. - Hi. - I have to say I'm sorry, some of the English in the family is really sort of so-so. This is Maximus, which is my amazing producer - and is an incredible songwriter. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Got it. - And back there is Feather, his girlfriend. They are both American. And this is my brother, Orson. - Hi. - Yeah. He's going to be one of your roommate for the weekend. And this is Bernetta. She is my stepmother, and she helped plan the whole weekend. So nice. Nice to meet you. I'm making wedding video, so I've been seeing plenty of pictures of you as a child. Bernetta saw pictures of you guys building forts. Audrey taught me everything I know. Hey, how are you? How's it going? How's it going? How was the traffic? Amen. That was pretty. Amen. Amen. Pass this that way. Here we go. Pass and share. For you, my love. - Oh, here. - No, thank you. - No? - She doesn't drink. Never in her life. Uh-oh. You're marrying a man who loves to drink and have fun. Well, I don't do drugs, either. I don't like the idea of losing control. - This is good. - Tati makes the best challah. - Who, Tati? - My aunt. Between my brother Orson and my mom. - Mmm! - She uses raw honey from the lower valley, right? - The Loire Valley. - Excusez-moi. Loire. By the way, the only thing sweeter than wine and honey, in the Loire Valley, is the pussy. So sorry, did you... - I mean, I lost my virginity... - Did you say the P word? Did you want some challah? It's really good luck to have that for Shabbat. Clemence is saving up for the wedding cake. Oh. Yeah, we making you a king's cake. Oh, galette des rois. Yeah. Galette des rois. - Very famous cake from Paris. - Oui, oui. With trinkets hidden inside. Whoever gets the trinket is proclaimed queen or king of the feast and considered very lucky. Uncle George makes the best king's cake, so I've basically starved myself for three days like this I can eat the whole cake. It's my weakness. Nice. So, I did want to, I did want to say, well, we wanted to just let you know how grateful we are that you all traveled here to celebrate with us from Paris and Israel and... - Brooklyn. - Great Neck. Brooklyn and Strong Island are in the house. You know, this property is a really sacred place to my family. You know, it's where I grew up spending my summer... Well, where we grew up spending our summers. And then when my mom got sick and my parents decided to sell it, I wanted to buy it to keep it in the family. You saved it. It really reminds me of my mom here. And I wish more than anything she was with us this weekend. Even in death, her presence is felt. And I didn't mean to make everybody sad, but she... her favorite cocktail was the... - Long Island Ice Tea. - Yes. To my loving and devoted mother, Joyce. Yeah, let's toast to your mother's soul. L'Chaim. Liam. Merci that you are loving and marrying my colorful stepdaughter Clemence, and how perfect that you changed the wedding date to be of the holy day of soul mates. One doesn't marry a person, one marries a family. - Cheers. - What's love really about? The thing above all is mercy. Specifically compassion for people who may not deserve it. All we want in life as parents is for our children to be happy. I hope that this marriage brings you both much joy and... Liam and I, we were raised more like twins because we're only 20 months apart. We probably spent more time together than with anyone else in our lives. When you called me five months into launching Radica Real Estate Europe, the last thing I thought you would tell me was that you had proposed to someone. My brother has always had the most picky, exquisite taste, so I'm sure that you are a wonderful person. And I do look forward to getting to know you. - Cheers. - Cheers. When do you start construction? My project in Montauk is already under way. No, I think he means here. Aren't you building a house here? Yeah, we start next week. What's happening? We're thinking of knocking down the two existing structures and creating one larger house. - Here? - No, we're not thinking about it. Yeah, well, that's what we're doing. Did you know about this? Nobody tells me anything. Yeah, I've honestly, I was so surprised that we got the approvals this fast and I thought I'd have time to let you both know. Did you show Clemence the designs I did to enhance the current structures? Yes, of course I did. We just ultimately decided we wanted one special home. You know, we want a place that feels like our own. Who's the architect? Isaac Larson. Is she joking with me? I mean, Isaac? How did you reconnect with him? We're in talks with him to become Radica's chief architect. Liam. You should have told me that. Oh, I'm a bit confused. Why would we need to consult you at all? It is not like you to not consider my feelings. Liam, you should've let Audrey know about Isaac. My life's moving really fast right now and I don't always have time to fill you both in on the details. You don't have time to tell me that you hired my ex-boyfriend to tear down our family home? Does sound pretty bad when you say it like that. Okay. So does that mean that I'm gonna be working with him on the North Island project? Well, actually we're thinking maybe it's better that we don't work with family. I came up with the concept and name of your company. I was really traumatized by working with my family, so... No, it's all right. I'll go. I'll be right back. Hey. Yeah. Has anyone spoken to Gene? Made a bad judgment call with Zanotec.

Well, your brother's in love. - He's a little crazy. - Can you believe Liam gave Clemence Mom's ring? Well, you know, she left it to him to give to his future wife. I know, but I didn't think that he was gonna give it to someone we hadn't even met yet. That ring is Mom. I know. Listen, I have a voice message for you for your birthday that Mom recorded in the hospital a few days before she passed. It was really important to her to give you something special for your 40th. I've been saving it for two years. I haven't heard it myself yet. Can I hear it? Tomorrow, on your birthday. Okay, on my birthday. - Good night. - Good night, Daddy. Liam. Are you serious? Did you commission this thing? You don't like it? It's my mother's wedding present for us. Did you paint this? - Oui. - Oh, it's really beautiful. I'm sorry, I'm just making fun of my brother. - Sorry. - Merci. - Liam. - What? Stop. Stop drinking. Should we show you your room? No, we're okay. We know where our room is. No, no, we put you up there for the weekend. Let me... let me help you guys with your bag. Liam, he's not even gonna fit in the bed. This is Bisou. Look, I know it's not ideal, but at least this way you guys get to bond with your new sibling. What is he doing with the kissing? It wouldn't be so bad if he didn't have the fucking mustache. - Oh, my God. - Well, let's... look. Let's make the best of it, okay? We'll have some fun. I got an early birthday present for you here, - some Sensuali-Tea, right? - Oh. - No. - Come on. I am not doing that again. It was amazing. I had such crazy sex. We could have a cup of this at the wedding. We could come back in here, it'd be totally empty... Mmm... Ethan. No. Ethan, no, I told you. Stop. I told you not to touch my stomach. Sorry. That was an accident. Can't sleep either? No, I got a lot on my mind. You want some challah? Yeah, that looks yummy, thanks. Thank you. To try? No, thanks. That thing gives me a headache. You like it? I am in it. I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Everything's virtual reality. You heard of simulation hypothesis? Nope. We're already in the future and right now is you in the game. Every moment of our life is "choose your own adventure." And the only person whose experience matters is your own. It's narcissistic to think that the only experience that matters is your own. Well, the people who do as they wish are free and happy. Yeah, but they're assholes. They're happy assholes. It's the people who think those people are assholes who are the unhappy ones. No? I mean, I'd like to think that we have the power to create our own reality in any given moment. We do. There are many ways to do it. I like to microdose... MDMA. How does it make you feel? Helps alleviate anxieties, makes people loving and outgoing. You should try it. No, I'm scared of that stuff. Right, right, right, right. Yay. ♪ Happy birthday, dear Audrey ♪ A toast, a toast. I just want to say happy birthday, Audrey. To the girl of my dreams, you are the best wife, mom and friend that anyone could ever have. And I want all your wishes to come true. I love you. It's in the bag. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. That was so thoughtful. It's from Clemence's favorite jeweler in Paris. This is so beautiful. She said that opals are a highly protective stone. Really? Maybe I should hang it on the houses so that they're protected and don't get torn down. I love it, thank you. That's really, really sweet. - Thank you. - Oh, hang on, hang on. Can you? Yes, yes, that's the one, right? Yeah, that's the one. I love this song. This is our anthem song. Audrey, come dance. - Yeah, come. - No, I'm okay, thanks. ♪ In the Hamptons ♪ Champagne? Champagne?

No, little bonbon, it's very unlikely - it will happen to you. - She's an idiot. - Who wants to go next? - Me, can I really water ski? Yeah. You sure you wouldn't rather just relax on the tube? - No, no fuckin' way. - Really? Okay, here's the whole thing is getting up is the hard part. So you just kind of lean back. - Okay, let's do it. - Okay. Audrey, can you drive? Maxi, I gotta film this. Thanks, Aud. You ready? Three, two, one. Lean back! - Nice. - Oh, yes! Yes! My little bonbon. Look at that taut string. Whoo. Whoo! You're waterskiing! Slow down! - Slow down and go straight. - Slow down! Go straight! Audrey, slow down. That wasn't cool. I didn't do anything. She did great. No, I slammed my neck into the board. Can't you hear me? No? - I didn't hear you. - I kept yelling at you for you to slow down. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, you're so sorry. No, my neck is fucking hurting now. Oh! That'll be air ball. Oh! Whoo! Game point. Gimme the ball. Shake and bake, baby. Oh, ah. Come on, Benny.

Bro, come on. That would have been a clean block if he didn't hopscotch through the lane. My Eurostep is clean, okay? I patented it after Manu. More like Euro trash. - We won it. - There's still more, yeah. - Oh, shit. - Put that on there. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. I can't fucking believe you. I told you not to play today. The photographer is coming. I'm sorry, it was a cheap foul. - Let's go. - Take some Advil and apply pressure, you'll feel better. - Thank you, Audrey. - Come on. You take good care of me. Hey, you guys, I expect A games all around. - Liam. - Bienvenue. Bienvenue. I don't care if you win. Look at what you're looking like right now. Look like a goddamn champion. Bonbon. You know Clemence tried to get me to sign a prenup. That's how bad she wanted me to know that she's not marrying me for the money. I refused, though. It's not, uh... It's not romantic. That is romantic. My neck is so stiff with the waterskiing. - It's just really bad here. - Aw. Well, Audrey is a licensed masseuse. She could probably help you with that, right, Audrey? Oh, really? I'm really not that good. Yes, you are. You are so good. That chiropractor taught you a lot. Can you help me? Please? Audrey? Okay, sure. - Oh, thank you. - Of course. This is shit. This is stupid. Is everything okay? It's the usual drama with my family. Do you want to talk about it? No. I'd rather not. You sure? I mean, sometimes it helps to get your feelings out. I'd really rather not get into it. Okay. So I brought this really yummy rose oil. I love it. There is a pink bottle just over there. Can you use that? Of course. Ow, oh, ouch. - Is that too deep? - Yeah. My neck is really tender. Let's try this. I'm gonna adjust your neck back into place. Is that safe? It'll work. No, but have you done it before? Yeah, I have. It'll be quick. You ready? Yeah, sure, okay. Okay. Wow. Yeah, it feels so much better. Oh, good. How cute is that? - Oh. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Uh... are you guys staying in here too? My uncle Philibert put us in here. Is that cool? Whatever. I mean... Where are we gonna sleep? I'm not sharing a bed. Fuck! Oh, my God, are you okay? No, I... It took me a month to find a dress that was flattering, and I totally splurged on this one because, you know, it fit perfectly. Such a fucking idiot. I was rushing to get to that interview! Oh, God. Do either of you have a white dress that I could borrow? I might have something. Really? Thank you. How about this? I don't think that that's gonna fit me. This? Okay, thank you. This is crazy. What are you doing? I'm waiting to use the shower. A bottle of oil exploded all over my dress. I have to go to town to see if I can find another one. Oh, no, baby, that sucks. What? What's going on? What are they saying? - Oh, my God. - What, what? Wait, I don't think it's healthy for me to tell you. Are you kidding? You have to tell me right now. It's very important that I speak to you privately now. What, what is it? Clemence had an abortion three weeks ago. Did you know that? No. Who told you that? I overheard her family talking about it. Well, she's young, you know? You of all people should relate. What happened to me is entirely different. How is that any different? Does Clemence even want children? - Did you guys discuss this? - My wedding is today, Audrey, today, in like a couple hours. What is a person supposed to do when they know that someone is making a huge mistake? Mom thought the exact same thing about you, and you felt like she totally derailed you. Now just stop. Stop. Oh, my God. Hey, hon. - How'd it go? - Not good. Did he know? No, and he's so accepting of her. - I don't get it. - Wow. - Okay. - And now I gotta go get a dress. Well, just wear something else. Let's do our tea. - Can't do that right now, babe. - Hey. They're looking for you to do hair and makeup. Hey, you look great. Can't do that right now. I gotta still go to town to get my dress. Hey, what are you bringing to burn tonight? You're supposed to bring something to let go. - Oh, my God, babe, bye. - Good luck. I'm fine, thanks. Where are you going? To the beach to clear my head. You want to join? I can't, I have to go find a dress. Mine's ruined. You might not need it. Oh. Clemence is hysterical that I found out about the abortion. And you're sure it was yours? Yes, Audrey. Does she never want kids or just not right now? She said maybe one day, but definitely not before she's 30, so I'll be almost 50 by then. So now what? I'm thinking about calling the wedding off. You happy now? No. You know, you haven't said one positive word about Clemence since I told you about her. Not one. I hoped for so much more from my sister, especially with mom. Mom would have hated Clemence. Well, Mom played everything safe, you know? What does that ever get anyone? It's not about being safe, Liam. Go find somebody wild, but have them be kind. She is not kind. And she lied to you. I get it, Audrey, I really do. I see her for who she is. Good. Good, then it's time to move on. It's not that simple, okay? You think that, like, hot French Jewish girls just grow on trees? She's really different than the girls we grew up around, and she's an artist, and she's passionate and I... the sex is incredible. Well, that doesn't always last. It's not just that, it's... it's the way that she makes me feel. You are so special, Liam. You are. And I promise you that you will find someone else that makes you feel amazing. - ♪ Blink once and it's over ♪ - Good luck. ♪ Don't stare at the sun ♪ ♪ Blink once and it's over ♪ ♪ Before it's begun ♪ - Hey, hello. - Hey. You wanna take pictures? Oh, I'm not sure that the wedding is even happening. - Really? - What? Yeah. Clemence hid something from Liam. Let me know what you find out, okay? Okay. Do you really think that was a good idea? I don't know. I gotta change. If this isn't happening, then I don't have to change. - Hey, handsome. - Hey. Hi. What's up? You got to get changed into your white dress, huh? Uh, I do? I'm gonna marry Clemence. Does anybody want anything from the bar? Aud. Mm-hmm. I love her. I don't know how to tell you this, but Clemence isn't comfortable with you coming to the wedding anymore. - What? - I told her that disinviting you is not an option, you know, but she was thinking maybe it's better that you don't stand under the huppah with us. Wha... that's unacceptable, Liam. Your mother is turning over in her grave right now. - I mean... - Dad. Oh, my God. Can you not make her more upset one time? I'm not the one that made her upset. Ethan. She won't let me stand under the huppah with my brother. You just have toxic energy, and I don't want that around me for the most important day of my life. - You have toxic energy, sweetie. - Audrey. - You are mean... - Hey! - ...and controlling. - Audrey. And totally self-absorbed. Enough, that's enough. Oh, please, don't gasp. You're all so busy trying to marry off this little teeny bopper. - Enough, Audrey. Enough. - I'm sure you understand how I feel. I mean there's no way this one was easy to raise. Audrey. Stop it, Audrey. And you have treated me terribly. And I get it, you're young. You haven't lived long enough to have ex-boyfriends - or to need money. - Audrey, Audrey! - But I have had enough of it. - Audrey, stop! - You are the most insensitive woman I have ever met. - Enough! - Enough! - You're going to destroy my family home. - That's enough, Audrey. - What? - It's enough! Stop yelling. - Okay, what? Stop yelling. Stop yelling, okay? Stop it. Just sorry, sweetie. Isaac is coming to the wedding. Why, I didn't even know he was in town, okay? I meant to tell you, I'm sorry. It's been a really intense day. Why did you invite him? Why? Because this is our fucking wedding. - This is our house. - Clemence, stop. And we can do whatever the hell we want and invite whoever the fuck we want. This isn't about you. This is who you're marrying, Liam. - Why does she have my ring? - It's not your ring. It's my mom's ring, and now it's mine. Yeah, you wanna see that? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - Hey, hey, hey, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Stop! - Okay, so now just to be fucking clear, if she is standing under the huppah, there is not wedding! - Do you got it? - I hear you, bonbon. Oh, my God, what the fuck just happened? Should we leave? I mean, I don't really feel welcome here anymore. No, you can't abandon your brother. I'm gonna go talk to Liam. If they don't allow you to stand under the huppah, I'm not standing there either. Yeah, that's right. Listen, why don't you go get a dress? Hopefully, everything will blow over by the time you get back, okay? I feel really bad about what just happened, but, I mean, did you see what she was just... What do you care if Isaac's coming? Because I'm 40 and I'm not even half of the woman I was when he knew me. He warned me that I'd be in the exact position I am in right now, a housewife who wasted her talents and did whatever her mom told her to do. I feel bad for Liam that he doesn't have what we have, you know, a real partnership. At least they have passion. Can I help you with anything? Yes, I need a white dress for my brother's wedding, and it starts in 45 minutes. - Do you have anything? - Yes. - Come with me. Let me show you what I have. - Oh, good, thank you. - Those. - Oh, good. Where's the wedding? Oh, it's at my family's... I mean, brother's house. It's across the street from Balsam Farms. Oh, yeah, nearby. - Okay. - What do you think? I think it looks like a nightgown. - I hate this. - Little too short. - Try this. - Okay. You see, I'm your fairy godmother. Can you please cast a spell and grant me a sweet personality? I might have just the thing, actually. Oh, you do? Thank you so much. Magic, organic potion. Oh, I need that. This is to you. - Cheers. - Cheers. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Okay, bye. Today, an invisible umbilical cord is being attached to both of you. - It's something that you cannot see... - I know. ...but you will feel it. It's a cord that gets attached in all relationships, and marriage is the strongest of these bonds. That's why sometimes when we think we're done with a relationship, we're not. This cord can never be broken, not even in death. Today on Tu B'av, we are witnessing Liam and Clemence's eternal love as we stand under the huppah which represents the home they will build together. Mazel tov! I have Mom's message. Oh, good. Let's sit for a minute. Hi, honey. Happy birthday. I'm sorry I can't be there to celebrate with you. I hope you're somewhere amazing with Ethan and the girls celebrating life. I loved turning 40. I don't know if I ever told you this, but my 40s were my best decade. You're still in your prime, and you have your kids all under one roof. Enjoy this time in your life, Audrey. It all goes by so fast. I hope you don't take this the wrong way somehow, because I think you're perfect, but I know you were scared in the past to get your stomach fixed, and it's so expensive. But if you want to, now you can. I think a gift from me and Daddy of 25 grand will more than cover the surgery. It's just an option. I love you, my darling. Happy birthday. Thank you, Daddy. That's so generous. I know she means well, and I really want to have that stupid surgery already, but I mean it's amazing that even from the grave, she's thinking about how I look. This was certainly not my idea. As a matter of fact... Hey. Congratulations. - Thanks, Dad. - Married man, huh? - Thank you. - Mazel tov. Thanks, Audrey. Thanks. - Hey, look. How that just went down really sucked. - Yeah. - You know? - Yeah. But let's try to have fun despite all the drama. Of course. Yeah, okay. I'll see you guys out on the... see you guys out on the dance floor. Okay. Yeah, yeah. - Bunch of bullshit. - I couldn't agree more. Well... this is the last time we're gonna be here and recognize this place, probably, so we should go have fun and try to celebrate all the amazing memories that we've made here. Agreed. Really happening. You know, we can go way, way up. Theoretically, anyway. I'm gonna go talk to Isaac. Sorry, just give me a second. Wow. Hi. God, it's been so long. And you still look so beautiful. Oh, no, I don't. Oh, my God, I wish. Thank you, though. I'm 40 today. Can you believe it? Happy birthday. Thank you. Do I look old? I've seen you in the media, and so I've watched you age, - but I'm totally rambling. - No. I think when you've known someone since they're young, the mind doesn't register the physical changes. Maybe, but I think at some point we'll just look old. There's no avoiding it, right? - Going by too fast, isn't it? - Oh, my God, yes. And congratulations on your career. I've been watching all of your success. It's incredible. So talented. - Thank you. - Yeah. And what have you been up to? What have I been up to? I've been doing a lot of things that add up to really nothing, but you know, of course except for my beautiful family. - I'm sure they're very lucky to have you. - Thanks. Yeah. It all turned out exactly the way you said it would. Which was how? Oh, you said that if I moved back home to finish my degree at a subpar architecture program that I would regret it for the rest of my life. - I did say that, didn't I? - Yes, you did. You did. I wouldn't give it too much weight. Well, it's hard not to. I mean, I think about it a lot. I think about you a lot. You do? - Hey. - Ethan! This is my husband, Ethan. This is Isaac. You know, I've told you about Isaac. - You saw his... - Yeah. It's really good to meet you. Yeah, likewise. Yeah, we watched your documentary on Netflix. - We did. - Yeah, you built a building in Belgium. - He did. It was so good. - Which one? - Really great. - It was good. Thanks, man. The chair, the chair, the chair. - Hi, sorry to interrupt. - Oh, hi. - You forgot your credit card, darling. - Thank you. That's so sweet of you. I was passing through on my way to dinner and I remember you saying the house was across from Balsam Farms. And I heard the music. - It's so much fun. - Really grateful. Thank you. Oh. Who's she? You're fine. Too cute. Very cute. Who is that? It's nice to meet you. In Judaism, they teach us God is everywhere. Sensuali-Tea. It's gonna take more than this to solve our problems. What? What are you talking about? - This was your idea, you know. - I know. It takes 30 to 90 minutes to kick in, so come on. Okay. Okay. I'm gonna go talk to Benny. Well, come find me when it kicks in. Hey. - Cheers. - Here's to Liam and Clemence. Oh, yeah. Nice. - Smooth. - By the way, how you been holding up? You know, I heard Gene's shutting down the fund at year end. Yeah, no, that's, that's... it's been rough. - You know what... - Can I have a beer, please, guy? Thank you. Long term, I'm sure it's a blessing. - Man, it's a dying business. - Do you want a beer? - Uh, sure. - Two of those, please. - Thanks. - Well, let me make a toast to a new business that I just started. What is it? It's called the Impossible Dog. Oh. Oh, cool. 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, the future... Mm-hmm? ...it's all meatless. - It's meatless. - Yeah. And these cows, they fart so much and they're just fucking up the whole environment. Excuse me, Benny. Be right back. One more, one more. Oh, okay. Ready, ready, ready? Excuse me, I just need to talk to my wife for a second, please. Let's have a conversation. What's wrong? Oh, you know, Benny Kipmore just told me that Gene's gonna shut down the fund at the end of the year. - So, yeah. - Oh. - Babe, I'm sorry. - Yeah. Maybe this is a blessing and you can do something that you love now. Oh, yeah. You so don't get how life works, Audrey. Not everybody gets to do what they love. You can't be a perfect architect. We're gonna need to make money, okay? You're gonna have to be a masseuse, I'm sorry. - You're gonna have to rub some people. - What's your problem? What's my problem? I'm super stressed out because I'm gonna lose my job and you're gawking at that fucking guy. I am not. Yes, you are. I'm watching you. Normally I wouldn't even give a shit about that, but you know, you told me that you failed at life by being my wife. - I did not say that. - You said it today. And I listened to you and I stood there and I hugged you like a fucking idiot. - You misunderstood what I said. - You know what, I completely understand now why we haven't had sex for nearly two years. Why is that? 'Cause you're not into me. Babe, that is so stupid. - I love you. - Oh, no. I'm the nice Jewish guy your mom wanted you to marry, and Isaac is the exotic goy whose baby she made you abort. And now you're just questioning your whole existence. No, we haven't had sex because I hate my body. The good news is that my mom left me 25 grand to fix it. No, your stomach's been bothering you since the girls were born, that was ten years ago. We haven't had sex since your mom died. Well, maybe that's just my way of mourning. - I'm taking the bus back to Brooklyn. - No, you are not doing that. You would never leave me at my brother's wedding on my birthday, on the holiday of soul mates. I would, 'cause I am. - I'm done. - What do you mean you're done? - I am done. I am done. - What do you mean you're done? I am done with the French. I am done with you. I am done with this day. You leave, I will never, ever forgive you. Do you understand me? Let go of me or I will make a scene. This wedding is a fucking joke. Fuck you. Fuck you. You should join me, Nat. I'll be going to Japan in January. Japan? Japan's on my list. Really? They have great golf there, I hear. Whoops, sorry. - Oh. - It's you. - There you are. Hi. - Hi. I saw Ethan left. You okay? Um, yeah, he went back to Brooklyn. Oh, why? Um, he's traveling in the morning. You fancy a stroll? I could use a little break from the action. Yeah, let's go. You pop up in my dream sometimes. I do? You think two people can have the same dream? I mean, nobody talks about their dreams, do they? So no one would ever find out. You talk about your dreams all the time, so everyone is finding out about yours. It's true. I just see my designs as manifestations of my dreams. I hear you're dreaming up a new house here. Yeah. How about that for a trip down memory lane? Hmm? It's got me thinking about what could have been. We would have a 20-year-old by now. Um... why haven't you gotten married? Well, I guess I was just having too much fun, wasn't I? My mom said you'd never get married. Your mom despised me. You had an abortion without discussing it with me. We were so young, and I wasn't my own person at that time. - I was so angry. - Yeah, so was I. I didn't think you would ever break up with me. It's pointless for us to talk about this now.

Yeah. Look, I need to tell you something. Well, I need to tell you something. You know the money that Mommy left me for my birthday? That's what I wanted to talk about. - Audrey. - What? I don't have that kind of money to give you. Your mom had no idea. Liam was paying all of her medical bills. I'm barely getting by these days. Oh. Look, I'll help you figure it out somehow. No, no, Dad. It's okay. Don't worry about it. - It's fine. - I'm really sorry, sweetheart. No, it's okay, Dad. It's okay. Oh. Mm! Are you okay? I think. Ah, your baby. You are the queen of the feast. Okay. Okay, we go wash the statue. All right. I thought Clemence said that you didn't speak English. Clemence hates me. She probably didn't want you talking to me. Oh. Well, we have something in common. Thank you all for joining this very special moment, - celebrating Liam and Clemence. - Cigarette? - Yes. Thank you. - Please enjoy the short film. ♪ This is how the story goes ♪ ♪ They found love ♪ ♪ And all was fine ♪ I'm surprised they find a picture of him with her as a child. He was the unfaithful, absent one. But she blamed me for not giving her a perfect family life. I wanted her to be a star. I sacrificed all my time taking her to acting, dancing, singing lessons. I wish I had a mom who pushed me and cared that I did something with my talents. It required a tremendous amount of discipline and discomfort. But now she has everything that I wished for her. The body, the voice, the prize husband. One day Clemence will realize what I did for her and she will thank me. I have a hard time letting go when I feel I've been mistreated. There is a Hindu saying, relationships are fierce karma. What do you mean? It's the people who trigger us the most who are sometimes our greatest teachers. They reflect back to us the things that we are not at peace within ourselves. We think that they are holding us back, but really they are helping us learn how to love deeper. Orson, Orson. Is there some... is there an antidote to this MDMA thing in case I want to change my mind? No, you can't stop. There's nothing I can do? Breathe. - But besides breathing. - Drink water. - Besides breathing. - Drink water. Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, yes.

I don't think that's true anymore. He always say that you are the perfect mother and the perfect wife, and you and Ethan have the great relationship and partnership that he admires so much. And he said that you're not caught up in bullshit... and you really care about the real... What's going on? - Oh, oh, here, here. - What's going on? I feel like I'm dying. - Hold her hair. - Bonbon, just breathe. Are you okay? Drink this, the whole thing. Wait, didn't Mom say we're not supposed to drink? Yeah, I know, but this is different, okay? Oh, my God. I think I have diarrhea. What the fuck is going on? Call an ambulance now! My wife is throwing up everything. It's really bad, it's really, it's really... Did she do any drugs or drink alcohol? No. - Is she on any prescription medication? - No. I don't wanna give her something that can kill her - if there's drugs in her system. - Hear you, - but she doesn't take drugs. - There may have been drugs in something she ate. What the fuck are you talking about, Audrey? I put MDMA on Clemence's king cake. Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking crazy, Audrey? - I took a little. - Oh, my fucking God. I feel so open. That is what crazy people do, they drug people. - Are you insane? - I wanted to be closer. - This is literally a crime. - You and I are never gonna be close if she and I don't get along. Because you drugged my wife. - Where am I? - I'm so sorry. - I know this is terrible... - Hey, hey, hey. Hey, baby, what's happening? Hey, we're just taking you to the hospital just as a precaution. Everything's okay. - Everything's okay now. - It's our wedding night. Turn around. No, you took a hallucinogenic drug. - Drugs? - Yes. I don't do drugs. Baby, tell him I don't do drugs. I told him, I told him that you don't do drugs. - I told him. - Clemence, I did something totally unforgivable. I dosed your cake with MDMA. Everything's okay, though. What do you mean? - What do you mean? - On your king's cake. I put drugs in it. MDMA. It's just a little Molly. You're gonna be fine. I'm on MDMA now? Yeah, but you know, it heals trauma and it makes you euphoric and open. And I was desperate to connect with you. As crazy as it sounds, I wasn't trying to hurt you. - I'm really sorry. - You're gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be okay. You've been jealous of me all weekend. Well, you've been jealous of me. - Audrey. - And my relationship with Liam. I want what's best for him, and it really sucked that you treated his family like shit. Audrey, it's just an apology. That's all you're doing right now is an apology. It's not personal. I just want to be family with Liam. I do see how you make Liam so happy. And I admire how you live so freely because I want to live that freely, too. Did you hear that? I'm gonna try so hard. I am. I really love this MDMA. Get back here! Bonbon, please wait! Bonbon!
