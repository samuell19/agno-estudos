Bogie! Let's go back. No way. We've come this far. Checked the battery? It's full. Bogie! Are we really doing it? Of course. Here we go. Now it's midnight. Rumor has it that you'll hear a strange noise at this hour. It's coming from above. What is it? Finally, the mystery behind the Thai music room has been solved.

Personally, I think we should try this method as well if we want to target the young gens. That's unnecessary, Pann. Our brand is long-established. It's enough to focus on the current customers. But our sales has been dropping! Many businesses have been disrupted. If we don't try something new, we may soon become one of them. I see his point. If we don't target young generations, I'm afraid we might end up like Pann said. To go along with his suggestion, does anyone have any ideas? Mr. Ton. A project this important shouldn't be handled by us. If we compare the age of the target audience to… ours… Okay. I know who's the best fit for this. Mesa. What is it, Lin? It's happening again. The smell is still there. It hasn't been long gone. You put it in this morning, right? Come in. Here it is, ma'am. What about the sponsorship request this morning? It's all taken care of. The details are in the e-mail I sent you. If what you said is true, the culprit must have done it during lunch. Everyone went for lunch, except two people. Ake from Sales and Aunty Mui. Could it be… Ake? I don't think so. He has diabetes. He didn't go out for lunch since his girlfriend made lunch for him. So… It's Aunty Mui? She's the sole suspect. I think… It's not her. A bog roll. She put it in because she hates the smell of durian. She thought this would absorb the odor. Are you eavesdropping on us? Hating the smell of durian doesn't mean she hates eating it. This smell… Lin, never put durians in the fridge again. Got it? It stinks! Got it. Follow me to the meeting room. Mesa as well. Me? Bogie, how old are you? Pardon? Only for those under 30? Yes. This campaign is focusing on the young. So the boss asked me to gather all the youngsters for ideas. Shouldn't we hire an ad agency for something like this? Indeed! That's the way, right? But… We should gather the ideas from young people under 30 years old in our office. Let them brainstorm. They can surely relate to the target audience. Are people under 30 in this office only the three of us? Actually, there's another. Hello? I'm working, Mom. Now everyone's here. All right. Throw me any ideas. How come the clock is running that fast? How about new packaging and logo? This way, we can shed our traditional image. Hang on. If we change that much, won't it affect our integrity? Say, we keep our original brand characteristic and only modernize it? Aren't you playing it too safe? It may not attract the young, you know? They aren't our only target audience. We can't ignore our current customers. But this project is aimed at the young. I have a conclusion. Which is? That we should call it a day! I'm done! That's your conclusion? How's the clock? Good. Good as new? Gone for good. Have you seen my flash drive? What does it look like? It's puppy-shaped, about this size. When you plug it in, it will… It will… It will move rhythmically, like… Back and forth, kind of. -Haven't seen it. -I see. Thanks. Wait! Is this it? Yes. Thank you. DOUBLE QUAIL BRAND So the flash drive that's with Joke is yours? Yeah. We must have switched it. I see. The thing is… I found this in his flash drive. OFFICE GIRLS, WATCH OUT! THE SERIAL KILLER "OFFICE GIRLS HUNTER" STILL AT LARGE! ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE FROM DR. AUNG, THE CRIMINOLOGIST, THE REAL KILLER IS… THE BIG BOSS OF DOUBLE QUAIL! What the heck is this? You look all stressed out because of this? Isn't it creepy? You know, one of the victims was from our office. You know her? No. She died before we started working here. I think it's somewhat worth considering about… What's gotten into Joke? What? How can you joke about this? What? Why be anxious about it? Even if this Office Girls Hunter is real, do you really think he is Mr. Ton, our boss? Come on! Who says a decent rich guy can't be a serial killer? Yeah, he can. Wait. No! I didn't mean it like that. I mean, Mr. Ton, he's… I am what? Are you talking about me? -No, Boss! -No, sir. We were talking about some celeb. That's right. Which one? Ton Juckkrit. -Amarat. -Yeah. That's right. You youngsters know him? My mom loves watching old dramas. Thought you were gossiping about me. You could, though. Just don't let me hear it. Are you two in the team working on the project with Pann? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. That's good. Please do your best, then. Our company's future lies in the hands of the new gen like you. Seriously? You folded an LCD monitor? Why can't you understand it? I told you to quit doing that! -What? -Don't force me to get real! You can't threaten me! You think I'm afraid of you? What's wrong? You look like you just witnessed a murder. It's nothing. I forgot something, so I came back in. -I'll get going. -Okay. What do you think Boss and Joke were arguing about? Don't think about it. Just go home and rest. You think I can sleep after that? "OFFICE GIRLS HUNTER" STILL AT LARGE! LAPAT CHIDDEE "MINT" WORKED AT IKIGAI COMPANY NOTIFICATION: THIS DAY IN THE PAST NINE YEARS AGO MESA MASE HAS ADDED PICS TO ALBUM GIE-SA I know we aren't together any more I know we are just friends now I keep telling myself that all the time Never hope it'd be the same Never hope we'd start over As I know it's already too late SUSPECT FOUND. LOOK FOR EVIDENCE? SKIP OR USE HELP NEW VICTIM FOUND. GO BACK OR MOVE FORWARD Bogie. You're here too, Boss? I came here for business. -I see. -A meeting with my father's friends. They like to have a meeting at the karaoke center. Brilliant meeting place. What are you doing, looking all tense? I'm playing a game. It's quite hard, though. This level isn't that hard, actually. You play this game, too? I completed it several times. Wait. You aren't pulling my leg, aren't you? I'm not joking. I have a trick, too. What trick? You have to think like a killer. Are you all right? I can't stop thinking about it. Morning, Boss. Good morning, Boss. You knew everything, right? I'm sorry. Guess I have to resort to extreme measures. I can't let this continue. What would we do if that happened? Morning, Boss. Good morning. You knew everything, right? I'm sorry. I can't let this continue. I have to resort to extreme measures. Just sell the entire stock. No need to keep it any longer. -What's wrong? -Nothing. It's our floor. Aren't you coming? Right, sir. Wait! Yes? This thing dropped from your bag. -Thank you, Boss. -Be more careful. You might lose important files. Do you think he knows? Knows what? Knows that we know that he… Gosh, Lin. Let's not imagine things. Wait until we see Joke and ask him. He quit? Kids these days are good for nothing. They always quit after a short time. Personal branding will attract our target audience and increase our brand awareness. This idea is interesting. Mesa. Mesa. Mesa! Yes? Wanna add anything? No, I don't. Have you thought at all? Of course, I have, but I didn't prepare a presentation. You can just tell us. Are you sure? Yes. Just share it if you prepared one. Right. Well… Our Double Quail is a long-established brand of T-shirts with a long history. So I think we should use this long history and modernize it. Hang on. That's exactly what I said last time. You said it may not attract the young. Well, actually, backing our strategy with stories is better than doing a straight sale. We can't just focus only on young people. Hey! I said that last time, too. Are you messing with me? Your ideas are both interesting. You're a team. No need to fight. TEA THAT CARES "THE MOST" Didn't I tell you to turn notifications off? I'm sorry. Actually, your ideas can be put together. We'll utilize our Boss and his story. That's a good idea. This company has been passed down to him from his father. So to present the story of our brand, he's the best fit for this. He has a great personality. Plus good looks. Don't you think so? So what do you say? I'm okay with that. I think it's good. Boss has been on media before. He also has lots of followers on Facebook. You snooped around his Facebook? Just a little research about him. I have a conclusion now. Which is? Well… Bogie, check Boss' schedule and look for media programs to have him on. So people get to know more about him. Lin, Mesa. Come up with a story and make a scoop about him. Whoa. He's serious this time. Of course I am! Have you seen me goofing around? Guys, this project is crucial. Go do your part now. Starting from today. Go. You think this campaign will really attract the young generation? I don't know. Just get it over with. Aren't you curious at all? What's the use of it now? Joke isn't here to ask anymore. Gie. Want a burger? You can have this. Nah. You eat that one, Lin. Isn't that right? You like cheese burgers more. Yes. JOKE: HELP! Help? THE BIG BOSS OF DOUBLE QUAIL! Don't tell me you believe this Dr. Aung? I didn't believe him. It's just a suspicion. We saw Joke arguing with Boss. Then he suddenly quit. Perhaps he stumbled upon some of Boss' secrets? That Boss is a serial killer? Why didn't you just ask him? He already quit, didn't he? So what? There're so many ways to contact him. We're sorry. The number you've dialed cannot be reached. How do you know he lives here? Just say my connections spread far. Seriously? Maybe he's out. Now what? -We can't do anything now. -Let's go home. We're already here. What? You were scared earlier! What do you want exactly? Guess we have to pick the lock. Good gracious! Hey. Guys! Let's not imagine things now. You'll be spooked for nothing. But look at his room! Maybe he doesn't have time to tidy up. You know, there are people like that. Come on, Gie! Can't you see all this mess? Like it's been ransacked. Ransacked, my ass. Valuables are still here. It's more like the room has been searched. Could it be… Don't tell me that you… We have no choice. We have to destroy the evidence. Boss already saw it. But… No! So what are we going to do now? Should we report it? I mean about Joke going missing. What if the police ask us anything? Who would believe you? All this serial killer thing. And those slides he made were so lame. No solid evidence at all. You're right. No one would believe such a thing. But actually, there's another person we can talk about this with. Should we really go this far? I thought he was that Dr… It's Dr. Aung. You contacted me, right? -Yes. It's about the case-- -Not here. Follow me. Hey! It's all right. Please come in. DETECTIVE CONAN From the looks of your boss, it fits the profiling I analyzed. But I still don't firmly believe that your boss is the Office Girls Hunter. Why? Because all this time, this killer's been very careful. That's why there's never been a suspect. With no suspect, every case turned out to be a suicide. So why, this time, would the killer kill his colleague? Are you saying that it was all a coincidence? I'd say it's just a conspiracy theory. But… My theory, however, is also a conspiracy one. But don't worry. I will seek the truth behind this. You know why? Why? Because of victims. The victims are real. "CAR RETRIEVED FROM UNDERWATER OFFICE GIRL DEAD INSIDE, NO VALUABLES FOUND So what should we do now? I think you all should act normal. Gather more information about the suspect. Get to know him better. Learn about his office and his relationship with his family. They got divorced when Mr. Ton was little. And after they got divorced, his mother moved abroad and never contacted home again. No wonder there're only photos of Boss and his father. The fact that his mom left must be a traumatic memory. These victims could reflect the image of the mother in the killer's mind. Then our Boss is really… Calm down, will you? His mom leaving him could make him kill women? Edmund Kemper killed many women. His last victim was his mother. But Dr. Aung said, according to psychological principle-- Those psychological principles that link everything to a motherly issue derived from psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud. There is lots of controversy about that nowadays. I didn't get a word you said. Bogie. Yes? You come with me to the show this afternoon. All right. Okay. I'll get my things. What show? It's the show Pann asked me to contact. We have a shoot this afternoon. -Do you have to go too? -Yeah. To take pictures and post on social media. It's all right. He wouldn't kill me during the recording. Gie! Watch it! He might hear you. How could he hear me? He's in his room. How can you be so sure? Have you never noticed? Whenever we've talked about him, he's showed up every time. Yes, Boss? -See? -Yes. All right. What did he say? He said if you're ready, meet him at the car. How are you girls working together? Yes? Is the campaign going on smoothly? We're doing just fine. Everyone is professional. Are you close to Mesa too? Not really. Why do you ask? Normally, I see her with Lin. Today I saw you with them. That's why. Right. Actually, I am not that close with her. -We just went to the same high school. -I see. You're so lucky to get to work with an old friend. Well, yes. Let's not get involved in this. How can we not? It's not often we come across something this huge for our channel. The headmaster may have nothing to do with this. The only evidence we have is this photo. Do you even know how much he got from lunch budget? See? You have nothing. But if you and I dig deeper into this, we may find more evidence. Mesa, you and I are high school students, not police officers. If things aren't like what we assume, it won't end easily with just points deduction. Can't we stick to making videos for fun? We have done a pretty good job all this time. But I don't think… I can do it anymore. I'm sorry. If you don't get what you want, you'll just quit, right? Are you all right? -Where are you going? -I'm making coffee. I heard photography is your hobby. That's right. What's your photography style? My style varies actually. But I prefer taking photos of women. -Wow! -Look at that! -I was so drunk that day. -What year was it? Everyone was so young. What are you all looking at? We're looking at Ake's photo. Look. He was so slim at the time. Of course, one has to grow. Look at your hair style. Look at this. Look at our Boss. -He looks just the same. -Yeah. -Forever hot. -Like a vampire. I'm falling for him. I was hot, too. You think? Where is she now? She passed away. Let's get back to work, everyone. Okay. Get back to work. It's sad to talk about the dead. Is that it? Yeah. That's it. It's just that she seemed to be too close to Mr. Ton. They're close friends. So what? Nothing is wrong about that. It's nothing if they were just colleagues. They were way beyond that. Listen. When Miss Anne started to work here, everyone said that she got in through special connections. If what you heard is true, now I know why the killer stopped killing for six years. Why? He made a mistake. From his actions, the killer was very careful. But the last time, he killed someone close to him. The police started to have eyes on him. What are you taking? I need your picture to post on Instagram. I'm on Instagram? I made an account for you, so people get to know you from various sources. Then take another one. Like, a candid photo. Whoa, Boss. If you're posing like this, how about we check the lighting and all too? -Do I look too serious? -Extremely. Boss. Can I ask you something? What is it? In the parking lot the other day, what were you arguing with Joke about? This killer used to kill continuously. I think he must be so desperate now. Try imagining this. It's like a heavy smoker trying to quit smoking. He smoked pot? Yes. I thought it was a cigarette. But the smell wasn't it. I didn't really care if he smoked pot. But he shouldn't do it at work. I warned him many times, but he didn't listen. Isn't there any way for us to prove this? Actually, there is. We'd like to present the history of the brand built up by his father. So you want to make a scoop at his place? That's right. That's a good idea. I rarely see you being this serious at work. -Finding evidence? -Yeah. Remember what Dr. Aung said? Many serial killers take items from his victims as trophies. What if you're caught? You'll be in big trouble. That's why I need your help. One more thing, Bogie can't know about this. I'd like Bogie to tag along and take some photos as well. For behind-the-scene use. Okay? All right. Hey! Where are you going? Number two. Right now? Of course! I can't hold it any longer. Let me go. Where's the restroom? Okay. Thank you very much. Many serial killers take items from his victims as trophies. Mr. Ton! We're not done yet. But the script says that's all. We need some extra info. What do you think about PM 2.5 crisis? Who is more appealing, me or Lisa of BLACKPINK? Send me the list if you have more questions. I'll answer later. Shit! Fuck! You and Mesa are up to something, right? What is it? I need to take your photos. I thought you got everything. It's not often we get to be at your place. So I'd like to take photos of you while at home. Just like candid photography. Are you out of your mind? You use work as an excuse to snoop around his place? What's got into you? If I didn't do it, how else were we going to prove this case? You really have to satisfy your curiosity, don't you? Are you Detective Conan or what? This is a matter of life and death. I can't just let it go! Because it's a serious matter. that's why you shouldn't get involved! What about Joke? He's still missing. I asked Boss about him. Boss argued with him because Joke was smoking weed at work. You know that? So you believe everything he said? What about you? You won't believe anyone at all? Let me ask you. That Dr. Aung is he more trustable than our boss? That film you gave me, I sent it to my acquaintance to develop. It should be ready in a few days. Well, where's that other friend of yours? She won't be joining us anymore. I was asking about you. Thought you wouldn't come. I went to get the witness. Hey! Hey. Hey! Who is this? "IS MARIJUANA A MAGIC CURE?" After talking to you about Joke, I thought I had to look into it. MY FAVORITE IDOLS, WON'T MISS IT FOR THE WORLD What about those slides and the room that looked like a crime scene? Think carefully about how you got yourself into this. Have you seen my flash drive? I thought it was mine. Wait until we see Joke. Maybe he's out. Let's go home. We're already here! What were Boss and Joke arguing about? I can't stop thinking about it. Aren't you curious at all? Aren't you curious at all? Let me reply to this first. Why did you do that? It's because of your Gie-Sa Channel. I was a top fan of your channel. When I heard the news… Hello, everyone. Gie-Sa is here again. We'd like to make a statement today. CLOSING THE CHANNEL We're closing the channel. We are in grade 12 now. We are going to different colleges. So we decide to close this channel. We hope you liked our channel. And, thank you for following us all this time. That's right. Well, if we have a chance, we may collaborate again. I'd like to thank everyone for the support. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye. Are you that Linhui? What Linhui? She left comments on all our videos. Remember? FC. LIKE YOUR CLIPS A LOT. How did you get involved in this? That day, I forgot something at work. THE BIG BOSS OF DOUBLE QUAIL! Shit! He was planning to post those slides online to get back at Boss for reprimanding him. He also planned to resign and go back his mom's. So he had nothing to lose. That's when I came up with this plan. The plan to reunite the legendary Gie-Sa once again. I never intended for things to escalate this much. So, you didn't believe the serial killer thing? The profiling by Dr. Aung could fit anyone. It even fits my dad's profile. And all the cases were closed by the police. So I thought if you combined force, you'd figure this out soon enough. Just like all the vids you made. You'd always found out that those rumors were all groundless. I'm sorry, Mesa! Please don't be mad at me! Stop. Don't you dare leave. All right. How's our scoop? It's being edited now. It'll be done after the long holiday. Okay. Great. Hold on! After the long holiday? Didn't we plan to finish it before the holiday? Can't it be done sooner? It's just a simple scoop. Come on! I got the footage yesterday. Didn't you say the deadline was next week? Now it's this week? No one can do it. No way! Right. I understand. Unacceptable. If we postpone it, all schedule will be affected. I kept reminding you of the deadline. Mesa, let me ask you. Where were you so preoccupied with all these days? How could you fail to do this simple task? Don't you see when you fail, it affects the whole team? Pann… I get it that an office job is boring. I'm sure it's not a dream job for a young gen like you. But you got a job in this company. You get paid for it. Could you at least be more serious? Don't just cut corners on a daily basis. Lots of people struggle so much to find a job. Now that you have one, can't you be grateful for that? Pann, you can't blame her alone for this. -Actually, there was-- -Hey! What is it? Spit it out or I'll scold you more. It's like this. Office Girls Hunter? Are you for real? All right. I get it now. But that has nothing to do with your failure. Pann, if the scoop is done on time, all will be good, right? I guess so. I'm sure Mesa can manage it. I haven't done this for ages. It's quite a handful. Is it this one? Thanks. Hey. Don't sweat it. I think I have to seriously consider what Pann said. Which is? My work. I know I did a sloppy job. I wasn't passionate about it. Is this what they call being burnt out? Hey. Well, you can be burnt out only if you have ever gotten serious, right? Whoa! That's harsh. So mean! But then again, I don't really love my job. But when you were investigating our boss, you were like an eager beaver. Though I know deep down that this serial killer thing was total nonsense, I just couldn't get it out of my head. That's so typically you. You're always into these kind of things. That's why I created a channel with you. Burning the midnight oil just like old times. Yeah. It was so much fun, though. I didn't even know about YouTubers back then. We only did it for fun. The view count was teensy weensy. When any clip reached 10,000 of views, -we went to karaoke to celebrate. -Karaoke! It's a pity. We made a lot of vids. But they're all gone. Who told you that? Look at you. I planned to delete them. But I couldn't bring myself to do so. -Thanks. -Hey. Stop thanking me already. That's not my thanks for the work. I'm thanking you for not deleting them. Boss. I have some work to finish. How is it working with the young generation? Well, we're still adapting. But it gets better with time. That's good. On the day of the shoot at your place, they didn't cause any trouble, right? Why? It's nothing. Why do you ask then? I'm just asking. Just asking? Yes, just making conversation. It's so quiet when there's no one here, right? Yeah. Why do you suddenly mention that? From what you asked me earlier, I was thinking about that too. Are you still here, sir? Well, I'm about to leave. What's the matter? -It's nothing. -Right. -I'll leave now. -Okay. MESA, I AM REALLY SORRY DR. AUNG What is it? Are you with Mesa? I can't reach her. Neither can I. I guess she blocked my contact. Oh, really? I'm so sorry. I did mess everything up. I might not believe your theory, but I shouldn't cause trouble. Leave that for now. We have a more urgent matter. I got all photos developed. Look at this photo. It was taken on the day Miss Anne died. From the outfit she was wearing, it's the same outfit on her dead body. It must be the reason that the police called for your boss. Another thing, look at the pendant on her neck. Now compare it to the photo from Ton's place taken by Mesa. Whoa! It's the same pendant. I'll call you back. Have you chosen the song? What? This song, really? Just say it if you can't handle it. Lin, are you out of your mind? Please come in. Dr. Aung. The pain in my heart I kept it all inside Memories of those heartache nights Nights without you Nights without you Silence is so tormenting I used to see you all the time But now that I see you again I can't hold it in It hurts deep down My wound Keeps discouraging me No love is certain Even you hated me Be mad at me I still love you It hurts deep down, my wound Keeps discouraging me No love is certain Even you hated me, be mad at me I still love you Your condo is kind of creepy. I'm used to it. Bye. Mesa. Boss? Captain, the suspect isn't at home. What are you doing here? I need to talk with you. It's important. Are you all right? Don't worry. That's not my blood. Mesa. Mesa! Mesa! Mr. Angkarn Manotham or Dr. Aung, An administrator of Criminal Mind by Dr. Aung page, was found dead in his apartment. Last night at 00:45 a.m., the police officers had arrested Mr. Tontrakarn Penkul, the chairman of Double Quail Company Limited. Holy shit. DEATH SENTENCE ONLY I knew it. It's chaos now. What about Lin? Does she know? EVIDENCE FROM DR. AUNG I only saw her email this morning. There were tons of calls from her. I called back, but no one answered. I don't know if something happened to her. IT'S ALL MY FAULT I'LL TALK TO DR. AUNG FOR MORE INFO SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE P.S. SORRY AGAIN Must be the photos you took. So he wanted to silence Dr. Aung. Let's not overthink it. Maybe it's nothing. It escalated this far. How is it nothing? Boss is already arrested. The police are handling it. Let them do their jobs. What if it's someone else's doing? Now Lin is missing and Boss is in custody. Maybe she just lost her phone. Stop imagining things. Gie. Can't you just see eye to eye with me? Why do you keep dismissing it like it's nothing? Mesa. When will you realize that all I do is because I care for you? Then why don't you care about how I feel? Do you know how hurt I feel when you never take my side? Actually… you have not changed at all. Earlier this afternoon, the lawyer has bailed out Mr. Tontrakarn Penkul, the suspect in the murder of Mr. Angkarn Manotham or Dr. Aung. #RIP DR. AUNG #RIP DR. AUNG Bogie. Are you coming with us? You said you had important thing to say. What is it? The film you got was the last set of photos I took of Anne. We were together back then. She left me. But then one day, she applied for a job in the company. Maybe I still couldn't get over her, so I approved her application. When we worked together, all those feelings kept flooding back. But I was not so sure about her. So I couldn't take our relationship seriously again. I never thought… that would be my last chance. I spent years looking for the culprit. The more I investigated, the more I felt I was going crazy. It was a wild goose chase. One day, I finally realized that I should let it go. When I knew what you guys were up to… I decided to continue my investigation. Then I found out the one coming up with all these theories. CRIMINAL MIND BY DR. AUNG SHE DID NOT RETURN HOME… Mister! Mister. Mister! What about Miss Anne's pendant? I had it specially made. There are two of them. I have one. Anne had one. Hang on, Boss. You're saying that pendant was specially made and there are two of them? That's right. What are you doing here? Pann. I wanted to discuss about work, but I've changed my mind. BOGIE Hello? Bogie, where are you? What's up, Mesa? Pann? Where's Bogie? The snoopy friends of yours, they are with me now. Both Bogie and Lin. Are you going to work? -Hop in! -Pann. Do you live around here? I ran an errand in the area. Hop in! I see. Mesa! It's Pann! Bogie, are you all right? Bogie! How about a briefing first? The objective is to help your friends. Pann, what do you want? You have to come to the office alone. You can't tell the police. You have half-an-hour. Hopefully, you'll meet the deadline this time. Are you still here? I still have some work to finish. I see. You can go home. I'll turn off the lights -and lock the door when I'm done. -Okay. Thank you very much then. -All right. -Please. Do you hear something? -It's nothing, I guess. -No? What's going on here? Pann. Why are you doing this? You read from his site, right? What did it say? Let me guess. The killer probably has issues with family. Especially with a mother. Probably hates her. Something like that, right? Why would I hate my mom? My mom was also an office worker. She worked so hard to raise me. NOTICE OF DEBT COLLECTION During the economic recession… she was laid off. Why must that happen to hard-working people? There're tons of useless workers everywhere! Shouldn't it be them who don't deserve to live? And that Anne… do you know how useless she was? That piece of junk couldn't do a thing! But she got to work here just because she's Boss' ex-girlfriend. Do you know what her position was? She was my superior. Coming here every morning to work under a person like her… was my suffering. I knew… no matter how lame she was, Boss would never fire her. So I did him a favor. Just being unskillful, incapable of work, did she really deserve to die? Have you never heard the phrase "Measure a man's worth by his actions alone?" Why care about those worthless pieces of junk? You're out of your mind. Speaking of being good at work… you aren't qualified, either. What's wrong? Feeling dizzy? You shouldn't have gotten up too fast. Lin! -You bastard! -Lin! Want to use in-house staff? -Want those brats to work with me? -Lin! Do you know what a hard time I had with them? Come on out. Let's get it over with. Mesa, I'm sorry for having never been on your side. I acted like I was protecting you. But I only did it for myself. I am such a coward. Darn it. My patience is running out. Lin. She won't wake up. What should we do? It's busy. Just come out now! You come out now, I promise it'll be done in one shot. Wanna answer that first? Great. My aim really sucks. What! A keyboard again? Hey. How about this? Nowhere to run, I guess. Even if you kill us all, you can't get away with it. Yeah. Look at all this mess. You can't cover it up. Who said I would cover it up. I just want to get some credit. I worked so hard, but no one appreciated it. Even when I am a serial killer, someone else took the credit for that. That fake Dr. Aung I killed, he is just a fabricator. When no one acknowledges your work, you'd feel so worthless. Pann. You're fired. I am so sick of you, too! 1 MONTH LATER It's finally revealed who the real Office Girls Hunter is. "Hard work never kills anyone." Don't you think so? How is it related? Well, you know, they didn't work hard, so they got killed. No? Don't forget to subscribe and click the bell icon for Gie-Sa… And Lin channel. Ugh. The view count is so small. Take it easy. We only posted it ten minutes ago. Yeah. It doesn't matter whether we have a small view count. We won't get any sponsors then. Hey, girls. Boss wants to see you in his office. What is it you need, Boss? Well, I have been thinking. The campaign you were working on was actually good. How about you continue and finish it? Don't worry. I have a professional to help you. Here he comes. He will help you on this campaign. You should get to know each other now.
