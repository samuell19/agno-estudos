Hey... Hey... Are you all right? Wait... Christ! What did they do to you? My family... My family... They've got the remote... The door... Family... must call them. Wait... A cell phone, please! A cell phone... Please, a cell phone... - Take it easy. - Call this number... 636... - 636... 46... 9... 90... 44... 44... 44... Give it to me! - Hello? - Dani, love, listen. Don't let anyone in, stay inside, call the police. Don't let anyone in until the police arrive, ok? Dad, they're here. They shot mom. Kidnapped Hey! You can't park there. Why not? I live here. - Yeah, but the truck... - How's it going? Fine, we'll be finished in a few hours. - Forgive him, he's new. - That's ok. - You got the invoice? - Yes, it's perfect. Take the car keys in case you have to move it. Hello? Hello! - I'll stay tomorrow. - You'll stay today. Look, I'll help you tomorrow. Mom, I can do it then. Ma'am, where does this go? - Mom, listen! - Isa, please! Excuse me. Leave it in the room at the end of the hall, please. - Isa... - I'll stay tomorrow! - No, today. - Don't do this to me, mom! It's bad enough that you've made me come and live out here! This place is like a graveyard! And now you won't even let me go out! Who won't let you go out? Tell me, who? You! That's unfair. I just want the three of us to stay in tonight. But I've arranged to go out. - Well, un-arrange it. - I can't do that, mom. It's a party, don't you understand? Your father and I have said no, and we mean no. Mom, dad doesn't care. He does care. He won't care, if you tell him. Don't start that. You just want to fuck me up. Isa, don't talk to me like that! And lower your voice. I'll ask dad. Leave your dad in peace. If I say no, it's no. No, mom, I'm going. I don't care what you say, I'm going. - What do you mean? - I'm going. Keep on like that... Ma'am, where does this go? - At the end of the hall. - That's mine, come with me. - Isa! We haven't finished. - My mother's being hysterical. Yeah, of course. Why not? Of course I'm going. If you come, even better. Let's meet at the entrance. I don't know, I'll text you later and tell you, ok? See you. Put that over there. - Are you guys exhausted? - Yeah, but we're almost done. How did you cut yourself? An accident. - Do you play golf? - No, they're my father's. At the far end? Yeah. - Shall I help you? - No. Yes? Excuse me. Where do I leave the bag? Leave it in that room. Marta. Do you know where mom is? In the sitting room, I think. Lots of light, like you wanted. Yeah. I haven't stopped all day, I need a shower. Yes, with hot water, but it gets cut off. You can't turn on both taps. Yes, it gets cut off. This is the fifth time I've called you. I see. Just a moment. - Yes, love? - The box with the files? In the study, on the shelf. Thanks. Look, let's see if we can sort this out. Hello? Hello? He hung up on me. Don't get angry, they'll fix it. Yeah, tell me that when you're having ice cold showers. It won't be that bad. In the summer, this'll be great. We might even have settled in by then. What about Internet? Weren't you going to call them? What? No, I'm sorry, we agreed that you'd call. We'll have it by tomorrow. Really... Put it facing that way, please. Careful. Against the wall. That's it. There. What are you doing? Something's stuck between my teeth. - I told you to use different floss. - Yeah, and I did. There are toothpicks in the kitchen. Shit. What? I was hoping it would get lost in the move. We're stuck with that thing. If it wasn't from your mother, you wouldn't hate it so much. - My mother never gave us that. - No, of course not. Yes? Yes, speaking. Yes, I've got broadband already. No, I'm not interested. And I'm very busy right now. - Is that enough? - Yes, thanks. - Be careful, eh? - Yes. Yes? Yes, speaking. I just told you I'm not interested. No, miss. - The toothpicks? - We weren't cut off. Coming! I hung up. What's that? It's your father, calling the gas people. You look lovely! - Was the water hot? - More or less. Here, put this in the fridge. - You bought champagne? - Yes, of course. Tonight we have to celebrate. - Now, the cheese... - Mom... Darling, get me... Get me a knife for the cheese. It's in that drawer. - This one? - Yes, that's it. - I'm not staying for supper. - Isa, let's not start that. Dad said I could go. - No, he didn't. - Yes, he did. - That's impossible. - I'm going to change. Isa, come here a minute! Isa, I'm talking to you! - What, mom? - What do you mean, "what, mom?" - We talked about this. - Yeah, mom, we did. - I told you I was seeing césar. - Invite him here for supper. How can I do that, mom? You can open the champagne, we'll have a toast and I'll leave. - No, isa, not like that. - Dad let me go, talk to him! - Mom, really! - I want the three of us here. - This is our first night... - I'm getting changed. Shit! Jaime. We have to call the gas people again. - What are you playing at? - That was cold! I'm sick of you not backing me up. What have I done now? It seems your daughter is going out. - Yes, she said something. - Yes. A party with césar, or something. - You like him, don't you? - Yes, I do like him. Well, then? You knew I wanted the three of us to be together tonight, maybe see a movie after supper. You and I can see it. It's not that, Jaime. We're a family. Can't we have dinner together on our first night here? I was looking forward to it. If she wants to go out with her friends, let her. What do you care? What do I care? It's not that. Where are my t-shirts? I can't find them. Everyone does their own thing here. I'm always the last to find out. Always. This one. And I've cooked for three. Here. I'm ravenous tonight, I'll eat everything. Yeah, you'll eat everything. She's 18, marta. Let her enjoy herself. Come on, loosen up a bit, please. Don't tell me that. Jaime, stop that. Let go, please! I'm being serious. Why am I always the bad guy? You're not, and no one ever says you are. I'm just saying she's at a difficult age. And we're not? I wonder what you were like at 18. I bet you'd like that, to see me at 18. I don't know if you're joking or being serious. Are you at that again? What's wrong? I think I've broken a tooth. - Broken it? - Or cracked it... - Get it checked tomorrow. - It's rubbing against my mouth. I don't want another gumboil. This is going to be difficult for her. - She won't get used to it overnight. - I know that. She's not the only one who moved. I just want your support. I want you to back me up. What was that? What...? Isa, sweetheart... Are you all right, love? She's bleeding, Jaime. - She's got a cut. - She's bleeding... - Are you all right? - Yes. I need a cloth, something to stop the bleeding. Please... What's wrong, love? Are you dizzy? What's going on, dad? - Calm down, love. - What do they want? Has the bleeding stopped? Please, my daughter... No! Please, don't hurt him! Take whatever you want. But don't hurt him, please. Calm down, love. What do you want? What do you want? Do you understand? What do you want? Take out the credit cards and write down the numbers.

Cell phones. - Cell phones? - Our cell phones. Where's yours, darling? In your purse? Is it in your purse? Here it is. Here. Where's yours? I left it in the office. I wanted to use it earlier and couldn't find it. Really? I don't understand, I looked for it and I couldn't... Really, I was... Please... Please, don't touch her! Leave her alone! Please... No, please, don't do that. No, please, Jaime! Please, don't! Please, leave her alone! Let her go! She can't breathe! Take the bag off her head! If you lie to me again, I'll kill your wife! If you lie to me again, I'll kill your wife! Take the bag off her head! Can't you see she's suffocating? She's suffocating. Please, take it off! What's the number for the safe? The... the... Come on!

If not, they die. Ok? Ok? I'm going to take off my hood. Wait a minute... no, please. Don't, we'll do whatever you say. - I don't care. - It isn't necessary. I know you won't tell the police. Itisn't necessary. Please, please. I don't want to see your face. All right. I've put it on again. Open your eyes. I didn't have time to see it. I don't want to see your face. We're going outside. I can't wear the hood. So I have to trust you. All right, all right. I won't say anything. Please... Let's go. The car keys are upstairs. Where are we going? Drive. Close the window. Where are we going? Don't hurt my family. - Which way? Right, left...? - Straight on. That's not up to me. Who is it up to? Who is it up to? You. Stop here. Come on. Get the maximum amount from every card. Aren't you coming? No, the atm has security cameras. But if you speak to anyone, if you ask for help, or do anything stupid, I'll make a call. Don't worry, I'll be right back. Yes, I'm on my way. Five minutes, I promise. You're crazy! Ok, see you soon. Don't move, please. No! No! Please, don't turn round. Take it easy. You must help me. Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. You have to help me, ok? Don't hurt me. Have you got a cell phone? You have to call the police. Do you understand?

The woman got scared when I walked up! - She must have... - Start the car! Move, move! Come on, move! When I went up, she must have... Faster. Right. Right. Ok. Right. Stop here. - Yes... - What are you doing? It's me. Do what you want with the mother. - No! Wait, please! - He didn't understand. - Please, don't do that! I swear... - No, he doesn't care. He doesn't care. Come here! No, please, don't! Tell them to stop. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Stop him! Tell him to stop, please! I think I'll give him another chance. No! Wait! I'll give you another chance. Start the car. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't... It's shit! It's fucking shit! Stop it! Stop it! No one tells me what to do! Stop it now! Stop it now! But it won't be with you. Not with an old woman. He told you not to! Stop, for fuck's sake! You can't. Are you expecting anyone? Are you? Mom! Mom! Help me, please! Help me. - You, come here. - No, no! Who is it? - Who is it? - I don't know! I don't know! What? Who is it? A friend... He shouldn't be here... - Who the fuck was it? - I don't know. - What? Who...? - A boy. - A boy? - And he went away. - What boy? - He's gone now! César! Shout again and I'll kill your mother. One sound and I'll kill your daughter. Isa, it's me. - What'll we do? - Give me the keys! Hello! Is isa there? It's césar. What the hell...? Who are you? Who are you? I'm a friend of isa. Is there anyone else? No... Why would there be?

I won't... Listen. I'd just like to know that when this is over you won't hurt us. I'm sure we can come to some kind of agreement. You want it? Take it. Take it and fire. I don't care. No hard feelings. I just want this to be over. Very well. I don't make deals. I don't negotiate. They're alive because it's easy. If it gets difficult, their lives don't matter. Alive or dead isn't important. Easy or difficult is important. I like things to be easy. And you? Easy. Easy. What are you doing? Aren't we going home? You said that when we got the money, we'd go back home. Turn off the engine. Hands on the wheel. We'll wait until one minute after midnight and then we'll get more money from the atm. Your family is at home. Be quiet, please. - We should've opened the door. - Be quiet, isa. Be quiet, please. Isa, please, be quiet. César didn't do anything. Neither did we. Calm down, sweetheart. - They're going to kill us! - They're not going to kill us... Word, word, word... I'm going to start crying. Move. Come on. She can't breathe. She's choking. Water, please. For fuck's sake! What? How many boyfriends do you have? - What? - Take the girl. Come on! Get rid of him. Or your daughter dies. I'l kill her. Understood? Ok. Good evening. Good evening. Is anything wrong? I'm sorry to bother you so late, but the neighbors rang to say they'd heard screams. Yes. It's just that my husband puts the TV on very loud. I tell him not to, but he always does. I'm sorry. Are you all right? What? Yes, why? You don't look very well. I'm a bit tired because I've just moved house and I'm very tired. Good night. I'm sorry, may I come in for a minute? Why? I've told you nothing's wrong. Why? It would just be a routine check. It's very late, and I'm very tired. I'm sorry. Good night. I hate to insist, but I have to do it. - It's very late. - Good evening. Is there some problem? No, I was explaining to your wife that we had complaints about the noise... Well... Come in. Please, come in. It's cold tonight. Come on. Darling, why don't you turn off the TV? Go on. I'm sorry I disturbed the neighbors. It's just that... This music equipment... We didn't have them in my country. Where are you from? Albania. Why? You're our first Albanian neighbor. You seem to be doing well. I can't complain. Well, how's your patrol? - Is there much trouble? - No, no. It's a quiet night. Well, sir, we can offer you... Would you like some coffee? Yes, thank you. Darling, why don't you heat some milk? Sugar? Yes, please. Well, I'm sorry, but... We've just moved, you know? Don't worry, some other day. I'll finish my patrol. Excuse me? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Come out! What did you do? God! You killed him! You killed him! - Why? - He realized... What the fuck happened in there? I told you to take the bitch... Get out of there! What? Now what do we do? They've seen your fucking face, you moron! They won't be able to say anything! You've fucked up from the start. It's all your fault. And what do you mean, they won't say anything? Shut up! Are you scared that they saw my face? You're crazy. You're fucking insane. Take the mother down to where the boy is. - Grab her! - What are you going to do? What...? Take me. Take me. - Instead of your daughter? - Yes. Yes? Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Why should I? Why? You're old and she's young. I won't fight you, I swear. Take me, please, take me. I love it when they fight. Please, no! You want me to fuck you? Mom! Mom! Mom! Get up, get up. It's all right. Everything all right? Keep going. What's wrong? Tell me, what's wrong? Did you call my home and no one answered? Is that it? What's going on? Jaime, it's your wife. She wants to talk to you. Let's go. Let's go! I didn't want this to happen. I didn't want this to happen. Selfish bitch... Selfish bitch... You should have opened the door. - You should have opened it. - Shut up! - Fucking selfish bitch! - Shut up! Shut up or I'll kill you! Shut up! Do you like it? Do you? Come on, say nice things. Come on. Like this? Like this? Like this? Stop it! Stop it. Wait your turn. I said, stop it, you bastard! Bastard! Bitch! Open the door! Please! Please, help me! Help me, please! Help me, please! Please, please! Why? Open the fucking door! Come on! Open the fucking door! Open the door, baby. Come on! Now that we're near the house, I'll tell you something. I don't want you to get upset in there. What's happened? The atm wasn't enough. We're going to the bank tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - To get more money. What can I do with the shit you got tonight? Don't worry. Has anything happened yet? Has anything happened yet? Has anything happened yet? Just a few more hours. Then we'll leave you in peace, you, your wife, your daughter, everyone. Don't worry. Stop, stop. What are you doing? Stop, stop! Stop the car! Stop the fucking car! Come here, we're not done. Get away from the door. Get away from the door! Drop it. Calm down. Put down the gun, I'm not like them. I'm not like them. Put down the gun. Put it down. Calm down, calm down. Trust me. What'll we do? Dad! Dad! Is there anyone left? I saw one of them leaving. Is there anyone left? Dad! Dad! Daddy! My baby... My baby... Are you all right? Whose blood is that? Where's mom? Where's mom, darling? Where's mom? - Mom! - Marta! I'm here! We have to get out of here. We're coming, marta! Down here! They've gone. They've gone. - Jaime, down here! - Mom! Mom! What did they do to you, my love? Are you all right? Jaime, please, get me out of here. Where's the tool box? The tool box, marta! - Are you ok, son? - Yes. I'll get help. I've got a cell phone here. In my pants. There's no signal, Jaime. There's no signal here! Love, listen to me. Isa, listen to me. Take this, sweetheart. Do you hear? It's all over. Police. This is an emergency. Three men broke into my house. 35, camino de simancas.
