Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. The Cry Slavek! Slavek! What's up? - It was singing. What? - It was singing. Sleep. Now, wait awhile... just awhile. Sit down here, please. I'll be right back. What's wrong with you, miss? Why are you crying? It's me. The girl from the bridge. You gave me your address. I've no place to stay. So, if you gave me your address... It was nice to see you again. So, I can leave. You've got a painting here. My only property. Created by Lada Fort, my best friend. It's painted in an interesting way. Actually, it's not painted. It was placed on the floor and heated colors are poured down... from above... as well as resin. Resin? - Yes, resin. Heated... to a high temperature. And as those colors are poured down it forms a very interesting structure. It's all very interesting. What are we gonna to do now? Well, you're gonna to live here. And I'll stay at Lada's place... or wherever. Actually, he has no place to stay too. So, you can stay here. After all, you've got that nice painting here... made of resins... by Mr. Fort. You're very kind. The only problem... where will you sleep? And here's your bed. Hello. - Hello. So, here you go! It awaits all of us. Men should be killed. Right? Sure. Listen, what he wrote to me. He's asking where to find the stock cubes. His letter to a maternity hospital! Gosh, where did I put that letter? I suppose it's under the pillow. So, sit with me awhile, Mila. But you can't lie down here. No. You can't, Mila. Why are you silent? I'm cold, Mila. You can't lie down here, Mila. What? No, Mila. End of the performance. When I grow up, I want to be a tank crewman. I like it, that tank crewmen are hidden in a tank. No one can see them, but they can see everyone. I want to be a tank crewman to achieve peace in the whole world. In a game of cat-and-mouse eight children took part. Zdenek was a cat and Lada was a mouse. How many children stood in a circle? Fanda! In the circle stood... seven children. In the circle stood... five children. Hello. Hello. Is this the right place to repair the TV set? Right but you're a bit early. - Well, I've a long schedule. Sit down, children. So, do we allow comrade repairmen to fix it? Yes! Yes! Yes!... So, you're allowed to do it. And we're going to sing that song again. Let's start from the beginning. "The Sun Rode Across the Spring Sky..." Let's start. No, you've all got to start singing at once. Daniel, behave yourself! So, "The Sun Rode Across the Spring Sky", huh? Let's start. Children, look at me! Have you heard what I've said? Children, look at me or I'll send comrade repairman away. No! No! No!... Shh! - Hush! Put it aside! What are you whispering? A secret. What's your secret? When will the state of emergency be? When will we go to the shelter? You said so. - Ah, that's on your mind! Please! - Go on. - I'd prefer to be invisible. Like that you can't be harmed. Do you think so? And what would you do if you were invisible? No clue about it? Do you know, children, what would you do? Who knows? Me! Me! Me!... All of you, gather round. Come here to talk! So, now... Do we choose Tamara? So, tell us. If I were invisible I'd peek through the keyhole somewhere and I'd listen to talk not suitable for children and I'd say: "Gee, I'll tell on you!" I see, Renata sits quietly as a mouse. Do you have no idea? If I were invisible there might be on the TV perhaps something unsuitable for little children... for example scenes with adults kissing each other... and I'd watch it if I were invisible. And you, Dan? I'd put a hat on my head and go out on the street and the hat would be walking all alone and below that hat would be a trumpet... I'd always win at hide-and-seek. Whenever I went to a soccer match I'd use it to get the ball out of the goal and I'd tell to everyone no goal was scored. I'd stomp on stairs in the apartment buildings and the caretakers would be bewildered. Besides I'd ring all the doorbells. I've got a cough. So, if being invisible I'd cough and people would be confused thinking the air is coughing by itself. If I were invisible I'd get into the bathtub to make bubbles and my mum would wonder about the bubbling. If I were invisible I'd go to my friend and I'd say: "Olina, look for me!" And she'd never find me due to me being invisible. Alarm is raised now! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!... Let's go, children! Line up quietly at the door and then we'll go down to the shelter. It's like playing hide-and-seek. No shouting is allowed! We'll hide in the basement. No bomb can reach us there... not even the biggest one. Mind your step on the stairs! Ow, Jirka... I told you to mind your step. Now, you've hurt your knee. Don't cry. In the shelter there's a first-aid kit. Oh, I'll never get it out. My luck in love must be tremendous. Hmm, really lucky... The Queen of spades again. She's haunting me. Oh, such lousy cards I haven't won for a long time. Does my man love me so much? It'd be almost unbearable then. Why do you lie there when your bed is here? This is my place. A woman should keep her own privacy. Even the lowest dog has it's own kennel. Ivana, come lie next to me. C'mon. Come here to read... and... I'll also read and... we're gonna as-if-read. As if, as if... I know you well. You won't read anything. - Yes, I will. Take this... something about astronauts. Now, you can read and I'll do the same. Did you pay the rent? - I did. How much did you lend to Lada? Um... not even a penny. Um... C'mon, Ivana! What's wrong with lending 500 crowns to Lada? So, don't tell me you didn't pay the rent. Okay, I didn't. Because Lada is my friend and I don't mind lending him 500 crowns. Whenever... just... Lada is... it's... He's such a friend... such a person. He's crying while painting... and sweating three shirts. - Painting? - ... fully. Okay, two shirts. What's the difference? He's a man... a person... a friend. You can't even understand. You've twelve shirts and what? - Um... Or what about me? Who am I? Mr. Nobody... with a big bag. Hey, look... you lend money, you didn't pay the rent, I'm pregnant... and you're going to read. Okay, just read! Fine. Oh, Ivana c'mon! Don't play being dead. I hate it. Ivana, please... I urge you to get rid of that girl. This isn't a brothel. Hush, you old witch! - How dare you? Hush! We're sleeping. So, I can get dressed, take my luggage and... It's easy. I can leave. C'mon. - I'm just a visitor here. Sure! You're a visitor. - So, I can leave. Of course, you can leave. No problem! You'll take your luggage and go away. You'll go... go... go... ... downstairs... Leave me alone, Slavek. Leave me alone! Slavek, I have a veil. Why don't you have a veil too? A man's life is so poor. I have a veil. - Huh. Do you know what I dreamed? I dreamed that the Old Town Hall was hit by lightning... ball lightning. And you said you'd like to have ball lightning at your wedding. Hey, look at this! This is a wedding gift from our landlady. Such a body! Huh? Looks like Alena. Which Alena? Ivana, please, stop being jealous of Alena. C'mon! On our wedding day... Now, you can sweep up your Alena. Huh? Why didn't you become pregnant? You could hide it under your suit jacket. Yeah. Look... I'm in a kind of to-be-expecting state too. But I've kept it secret so far. And how big is it? What? - Well... Well... Small... something like this. Maternity hospital. Can you say something? Excuse me, sir, we're busy here. Hello! This is the flat of Jaroslav Prochazka. Who's calling? Jaroslav Prochazka? Hello, Mr. Prochazka. We've got that chair finally. You know... that wicker chair. What do you say? You don't like to sit? Um... it wasn't nice to say this to me. Because I like to sit a lot. I mean, all the time. It's a pity "the first time" is only once. Do you hear me, Slavek? ...at all? We're never gonna to furnish our first flat again. What flat? Ah, our flat. I see. The only important thing is a divan bed. And it can be even placed in an open field. Under a beech tree... to be protected from the rain. Ah, so... Mr. Prochazka and his divan bed. Which reminds me... Didn't you lose that lottery ticket? Our losing lottery ticket! Actually, the best was when we had nothing. The best times! Right? - Yeah. How was I when we first met? Different, huh? Of course... different. I'm old now, huh? - We grow old... but you keep asking again and again. Well, I was always old. You repeat this... - I already knew everything even at 5. Everything! You see? That's what I'm told. But it isn't obvious until this very day. Hmm, I said I'm old and you don't try to convince me otherwise. You're supposed to disagree even when I'll be 70. - I disagree. Aren't you afraid I'll become smarter than you? - Well... You like stupid girls. I already know that. Ivana, c'mon. You told me once. - It's not true. - I remember it well. Hey, let's look out of the window. Don't look out alone. - But I like to look out alone. But I think then you fell for someone. You fell for someone, huh? Dear Ivana, all the phone boxes are occupied or broken. So, I'm writing you a letter. I bought strawberries for you. Frozen strawberries. Meanwhile, we'll play Bach. The same record you used to play in the morning... and in the evening... at noon too. Well... I haven't washed the dishes yet but I'll do it soon. And do you know what? I'll play your favorite Bach now. Ivana! You're afraid again, huh? C'mon. Just listen. And don't be afraid. So... I'm gonna to look for a free phone box again. Now, I'll leave you alone awhile. You can try to walk. No, I'll remain like this. Of course, you can. Don't say you can't. Mr. Big Bag! Mr. Big Bag! Come here. Come... Come here. Hello, Mr. Big Bag. This is our marriage. Fine! Once more... and look at each other... and smile. Thanks! Now, all of you, please, follow me. ...emphasize and grasp his intention. Don't you mind a bit of aesthetics? - What? Aesthetics... - Ah, so! No problem. I've no clue. At the end we've to point out... that this notable Italian film... despite its inherent passive view... Hello! Yes, I'll hand you over. Ah, it's you, comrade. Yes. Yes. I'll carry it out. Sure! Yes. Labor be honored! ...inherent passive view of society... and the lack of display of active societal forces... of contemporary Italy... is within a framework of socialist countries... Pardon!... is within a framework of capitalist countries... relatively... progressive... work of art. ...relatively progressive work of art. For us it's also a documentary about the stagnant state among even the foremost... Slow down, please. ...stagnant state among even the foremost... - It's fixed. Can I use your phone? - Sure. ... even the foremost bourgeois artists who fail to find... Please, write: "who cannot find". ...the way out of the social crisis of the western world. Hello! I'd like to ask about my wife. Add my sign and hand it to me. You're sports newspaper editors?! Then it's a mistake. I'm sorry. What's up? Um, my wife is about to give birth... in a hospital. You've to use code 2. Milena, call there. Coincidentally, there's an open bottle. It's Slovignac. A gift from our Slovak comrades. Milena, take a break and join us. Cheers! You don't drink? - I've to ride my scooter. You prefer to make kids, huh? It's great too. Milena, don't look so tragic. We've a whole tragic generation nowadays. She'll teach me how to dance the twist. And both of us will be merry, huh? "I'd prefer not to read that novel..." When I was 18 I was a member of the Left Front. And we were into... gosh, how it was? Ah, empirio-criticism. We adored Babel, Pasternak and Le Corbusier. Uh-huh. Well... Well, I must go. Go ahead, dad! Hello, I came to fix the TV set. So, come in. Take a seat. Don't look around. I haven't cleaned up yet. I don't mind. - I'm working night shifts. So, where's the TV set? Since you didn't show up, guys from my work fixed it. Ah, the guys... Then I lent it to an old lady next door. She suffered a stroke... and she's more fond of watching TV than me. ...more fond of life in general. Hah... I'm so sleepy. Do you mind if I go into bed? - Not at all. I'm leaving. Take a seat. Take a seat. Do you want to sit down here? Why not? You can lie here as well. Hey, a TV repairman on the way. The boy is late. Expect rather a girl. What's up, girls? What a pity! We saw a nice dress there... red, made of taft, huh? Yeah, very nice... nicely sewn. Obviously that dress was from abroad, because... Try to calm down. Breathe easily. Completely at ease, relax... Slavek! Slavek! Your heart's not beating. You're stuffed, huh? Yeah. Look. I'm leaving. Where? - You won't get to know. Hmm, sorry for asking. You're not making reports as well. That's true. So, goodbye! So, you're no longer interested, where I'm going? Well... not much. C'mon, Ivana. What's up? What did I do wrong? I've haven't a clue. Are you blind? Look where you're going! It won't get any better. You can turn it off. Actually, you're lucky. The original components aren't available here. Write out the bill. Can I make a call, please. Sure. Hello! Maternity hospital? Prochazka calling. I'd like to ask about my wife. Ivana Prochazkova... she was admitted this morning. When? Within an hour or tomorrow?! Can I write the bill here? - Sure. Can I ask you something? - Of course. Did you want it? What? - That child. Maybe I didn't... but I do now. But why? What a question! Maybe you want to preserve your name. Do you have a nice name? Prochazka. Prochazka, hmm. So, do you want to preserve the name Prochazka? ... to make sure Prochazkas [Walkers] will walk the earth ad infinitum. ... forever. The endless queue of Prochazkas. You know... I see you all walking towards a bright future. Crowds of Prochazkas! Shithead! Don't push, don't... Breathe, breathe... don't push. Breathe easily... at ease... at ease. Breathe again... rhythmically. Yeah, yeah. Relax in this position... yeah. A holiday in this region can offer nice experiences for the coal miners. Thus using coal in winter, you'll even feel the warmth of those sunny days. Moments of the Week In the city of Sala are growing new buildings of the nitrogen factory. Engineers, fitters and welders of the whole country participate. Alena! - Their only focus is to meet deadlines. - Look this way. I don't want to. You're my cinema. Do you prefer a sound film or silent? Parents arrived? - No, but you'll sleep alone. No way! - Don't argue. - No way! - Don't argue. A tough job for a jury. Pets in the contest had to compete even with the charm of their female owners. Why does a chair require four legs? One can sit even in a bowl. Especially if one's body has an aerodynamic shape. As shown in these shots from Western Germany. In Becov in Northern Bohemia 47 acres of land were lying fallow. Cooperative members decided... - One Rat Met the Other Rat Under Ground, Under Ground. One Rat Met the Other Rat... Wait a Minute Mr. Rat. Wait a Minute Mr. Rat... Today it sucks. - It sucks completely. One goes to a cinema and tomorrow one doesn't even remember being there. In these films there's nothing to laugh at, nor to cry for. In the past it was different. - Yeah. And today? War and only war! You're right, madam. Anyway, back at home I'll take a hot water bottle to bed and... Good idea. - And they can even drop an A-bomb, if they like it so much. Other models didn't reach so far into history. An evening dress resembling a costume of the era of Marie... Ivana! Ivana! Oh, hello! Hello! - Hello, Slavek! Where have you been? At the cinema. Aww, without me. Well, you aren't there now. So, at least buy me something. What? An apple, for example. Or that yellow hat which I always wanted. Actually, I didn't want it. I only liked it. Or buy me a vintage car. Yeah, buy me that. So very vintage we'll have to push it in front of us. Let's go, man! I'm in a hurry. I'm gonna to work. But first of all buy me... buy me... buy me... Hey, buy me a coin. An old one... for one crown. One coin. - So, wait here, huh? - Okay. But hurry up! You were in there for ages. A good torture tool. I'm gonna torture you with this. Hey, you didn't buy me an apple. Actually, I've an apple here. It'll probably be sour. But... Hey, wait! A shipment of Three Zebras Arrived at the Zoo - What? A shipment of Three Zebras Arrived at the Zoo I want a photo as I bite into a sour apple. I'll pretend to lean on you and you hold me. Don't move. I've got to go. - Don't go. - I've got to... Ow. What's up? Your cactus. Did it hurt? - No. But I want it to hurt you. - Hmm. I'd prefer to rip off your ear. But I'm too late. Bye, sour apple. - Bye. Bye! Where have you been, madam? Me? Nowhere. Pardon! Just a small favor, please. Tell me six numbers. No thinking!

I was calling you. They said you aren't there. And... I don't know... I'm sad. I used to cry. On Monday, on Tuesday... On Thursday I used to cry too. Not now, no... here's a lot of people. I can't cry here. A lot of people, you know. I love you so much. I don't know what to do. Can you? Just fine! Fine! Fine! Fine! I'm going to wait for you. Sure!

But for sure, please. Thanks! Goodbye. People are waiting for the phone box and he's calling Czech girls. Besides, the dandy hired this boy to help him. He had a note pad full of girls names. That's not true. He had no note pad. Don't lie. You yourself told me about it. It's a lie. Hey, Frantik... - I'm not Frantik. I'm gonna call you Frantik anyway. Hurry home! Leave quickly. Hurry up! Really folks, he had such a thick note pad and every second name was cross-checked. Isn't it obvious? Whenever he scored, he cross-checked the name. I should have punched him right away. - Stop this! Hey... Stay out of it. First learn Czech and then speak. Is that clear enough? Stop this nonsense! Hey, lad... Do you know what? Go to the phone box and call your chicks. Big Bag! Hey, Big Bag! Hi! Is it really you? I hope, it's me. How are you? - Don't ask for any ideas. Let me live. Are you still painting? - Well, all the time. And I'm looking accordingly. Not bad! You look like you're homeless. - Likewise. Do you have a cigar? - Dude, I've just got beaten up at the post office. Yes. We're the nation of onlookers. Take it. - Thanks. This morning I took Ivana to the maternity hospital. Hey. No, it's okay. Ivana? Wait a minute. What Ivana do you mean? Ah, Ivana! So, did you marry her? - I did. Wait a minute.

C'mon. Enter! There's a bit of a mess here. - I'm really curious. - Come in. C'mon. I'm in already. This isn't my place. There's three of us here. Follow me. Nice, huh? - Oh, man, It's great. Where did you get it? - Don't ask me, pal, don't ask. Aren't you gonna need it yourself? No. Hey, take it. And pick something else you want. How much do I owe you? 500?! I'll give you back 1000. Breathe... start to breathe. Don't push, don't push... Don't push yet. Breathe easily, breathe... Breathe deeply... deeply... Yeah, yeah... Relax, relax... Ivana! We saw each other before we met. Do you remember? Actually no, wait a minute. We've known each other even before our first glance, huh? Finally, I can tell you something. I always grieve a lot, when you leave. Even though I know you'll come back. You'll keep coming back, huh? But what if you won't come back? What shall I do? You don't mind leaving me alone. But you pretend... as if feeling sad. And I feel like crying but I pretend to be happy. And everything is only "as if". We use to as-if-read. And so on. Why is everything only "as if"? And when is it real then? Is it now for real? I'll recite you a poem, huh? It's composed by me. We're Two... always just Two... we can't be One. We're One... always just One... we can't be Two. Stop thinking... and come to bed.

"So, thanks." You see, it's snowing. Don't follow me. I forbid you to do so. Okay. But you followed me, huh? - Me? I didn't. Why? So, follow me now. Big Bag! It's cross-eyed in a splendid way. It's cross-eyed as that sour apple you gave me. And most strange was its first glance at me. When glancing for the first time one looks like knowing everything. And thereafter starts to forget.
