I OFTEN THINK OF HAWAII... A FILM BY ELFI MIKESCH My name is Carmen. I'll be sixteen soon. I lived in Kreuzberg for 14 years. We had a nice, big courtyard there. A chestnut tree. There were lots of kids to play with. And my friend. We got on well with the other people in the building. And my school wasn't far away. We moved two years ago and I don't have any friends at all out there. One of the girls in my class lives there, but I have nothing to do with her, so I go to Kreuzberg to see my friend there. THIS STREET IS SITUATED ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, RIGHT NEXT TO A HIGH-RISE HOUSING ESTATE TERRACED HOUSES RUN ALONG THE EDGE OF THE HIGH-RISE HOUSING ESTATE CARMEN LIVES ON THIS STREET WITH HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER TITO MONDAY THE MOTHER LEAVES FOR WORK AT 5 A.M. EVERY DAY SHE WORKS AS A CLEANER If you ever feel really lonely. And if you want to cry. When you feel the sadness of someone who isn't loved anymore. When the nights grow longer, when there is no awakening anymore, go to the seashore, my girl. She doesn't go there anymore. She will never go there again. The first kiss you ever gave you will never forget. Don't worry, my girl. It's the same for all of us. If you're crying... because he forgot you. Let go of your pain, my child. Now you don't feel so alone. Come and sing with me. Because this will be your song. TUESDAY CARMEN IS DOING HER SCHOOLWORK BECAUSE SHE GOES TO GRAMMAR SCHOOL My room is about ten square metres. It has two cupboards. A sofa, two chairs, a table, a daybed. A bedding box. A clock. A tape recorder, two shelves. A rug, cuddly toys, pictures, cushions. Blankets. And what I would like to have two pieces of furniture... in blue, a table, a glass-topped table, a small cupboard, and... lots of shelves where I could put my cuddly toys: cats, a Syrian hamster, tigers, an owl rabbits. A postcard to Strasburg, Chinese postcards. And pictures with landscapes on them. From South America, India, and China. A small standard lamp. A large, blue, soft rug. Wallpaper with overlapping colours. At the moment, I don't like the cupboards, the wallpaper and the table. It doesn't fit in the room. It needs to be bigger. I don't like the curtains. The room is too small for all the things in it. I hardly have any room to move. And I don't like the bushes in front of my windows. They bother me. My room only gets a few hours of sun when I'm not even there. There is always a dream which stays awake A SCHOOL POEM BY PAUL ELUARD And a smile At the end of grief an open window There is always a dream which stays awake Desire to fill Hunger to satisfy An open hand Carmen! Carmen! Attentive eyes Carmen! A life, the life to share The thing is that I... always have this wish that I can't fulfil. But I never give up hope. I try to forget the wish by thinking of something else, but... it always returns, the hope that something will happen that will make it possible after all. And I really like that, but I can't explain it. It tells me everything that I... need to know about it and I know what is meant. I can't put it any other way, because I don't know how, but... I have a certain feeling that I can't explain. Fluorescent lights, hallways 50 metres long. It's the pain. Women hate each other. -Illnesses. Where can I go? Not to hear, not to see. Not to hear, not to see. How can I put it? How can I put it? Where can I go? How can I put it? -Hallways 50 metres long. Hallways 50 metres long. It's the pain. Illnesses. -Hallways 50 metres long. Where can I go? How can I put it? Where can I go? Not to hear, not to see. How can I put it? How can I put it? How can I put it? How can I put it? How can I put it? I think my mother's work is very dull. Because she always does the same: wiping, sweeping and vacuuming. That's all her work involves. The way I see it, some jobs... are completely pointless. I understand that she has to do it, though. Obviously you can't eat off dirty plates. Because otherwise... you'd end up eating bacteria. It's not very nice either, eating off dirty plates. You need to have clean dishes. If we had a dishwasher... we could do more important things than washing up. I'd like to learn something, but... I don't really know exactly what I want to do later. I don't want to be lonely. I... I don't want... to be lonely. I don't want... to be lonely. I don't... want... to be lonely. I don't want to be lonely. FRIDAY If you ever feel really lonely... and if you want to cry... When you feel the sadness of someone... who is no longer loved. When the nights grow longer, when there is no awakening anymore... go to the seashore, my girl. She doesn't go there anymore. She will never go there again. You, with golden hair, with teeth like pearls, with ruby lips, tell me if you love me the way I love you. You know that I'm listening to you. Enveloped by a breeze which seems to say: I... love you very much. I love you... very much. I love you. I... love you... very much. As much as I did back then. Always, until I die. I'd like to have one or two children one day. Because I think it's nice. I don't know why, but... I think if I didn't have any, I'd be... all alone and I'd feel... lonely and... If I didn't have any friends either, just a few acquaintances, but if I didn't get on so well with them either... And if I just sat at home all day, that wouldn't be nice either. If you have a television, all you do is watch TV. If I was at home all day... I'd be lonely. I'd become more and more stupid and knit all day. Cook... or maybe... Maybe I'd eat all day or sit on the balcony. If I had one. You could stand there and look out all day. And... if you had no contact with other people... And if you had no children either. And that... If you had no pets or anything, you'd feel even lonelier. I think that children liven up a home. I think it's good if you have someone to keep you busy at home. People should have... other living beings to keep them occupied. But... why I want to have two children... I don't actually know. I want to see the sunset on Hawaii. As I lie in the sand under the palm trees, listening to the sea. Or... I'd like to sail out onto the sea. And the sunset. And then watch the stars in the sky. Dreaming all the while, and hoping... that this night will never end. Later on, I would sail back to the island. And... lie on the beach for hours. And listen to the sea. I would listen to the sound of the waves, softly rolling onto the beach. And the rustling of the leaves, quietly blown to and fro by the wind. And if the hour had grown quite late, I would go to sleep. And... look forward to the next sunset. To the sea and the beach. And the palm trees. The sunset would be my favourite thing in the world. When the sun slowly sets, creating a reddish glow in the sky. A reddish glimmer appears on the water. The sea then engulfs the sun and then... little by little, night falls. And the stars begin to twinkle in the sky. This... must be a wonderful sight to behold. But unfortunately for me, this will always... be nothing but a beautiful dream. There was a profound silence, and only every so often... a woman's lament... THE MOTHER WAS FED UP OF WORKING IN THE BUTTON FACTORY. SHE WANTED TO GO TO AMERICA. INSTEAD, SHE FELL IN LOVE WITH AN AMERICAN SOLDIER. ROBERTO FROM PUERTO RICO. ROBERTO ABANDONED HER AND HIS TWO CHILDREN, CARMEN AND TITO. He would have shown me the world. He would have shown me the world. He would have shown me the world. Would he have shown me the world? Roberto, Roberto. We didn't have any plans. Don't kill me, my heart. I cannot live without your love. Don't tell me that I am going to lose you. Don't kill me, my heart. Even if I were never to think of you again. Even if I were never to belong to you. The day I declared my love to you, I gave you my love, and I didn't know anything about you. Don't kill me, my heart. If you were thinking of changing my destiny, then cast your mind back a little. If you then regret your past, you look at me and say goodbye, I will bare my soul to you and say that you can stay. Because I am leaving. Don't kill me, my heart. FRIDAY He would have shown me the world. Would he have shown me the world? He would have shown me the world. Roberto. Roberto. Roberto. Tears emerge like a cross. My hair is completely white. I shall borrow my youth from my past one more time. I will teach you how to love because you did not love. Blood seeps from my lips. I have already buried my defeat. Today I am all alone, because I know that my love means nothing without you. I think that my mother is a lonely person. Because she's on her own when she gets home from work and people don't... come by very often. I don't know why that is. She used to say... that she couldn't go away, because of us. But today... I don't get it. But I think she's also responsible and her work is, too. When I come home in the evening, Mother's asleep already or still watching TV. But normally we go to bed pretty soon after that. I don't see my mother in the morning, or not very often, because when I get up she's already gone. And she gets home at about 3 or 4 in the afternoon and I'm not there then. When we see each other it's actually only on Saturdays and Sundays, but... then we don't talk to each other much either about problems and that. Because we have so little contact with each other. I'm not very close to Tito either, because he talks about his girlfriend a lot. And then I have to listen. But we don't talk about our problems. Of course I have problems, and so does he. But... we don't talk about them, not to Mother either. Because she isn't there and you kind of... If you don't see each other for a long time, you grow apart. I'm sure it also... has something to do with me because... I refuse to talk about things. Because I know very well that it's not possible. And... that she just doesn't understand me. I don't want to talk about myself. Because then she tells me I'm not the only one with problems and she has lots to deal with too. But... I do think... that people should talk to children about their problems. Discuss them together. But... this isn't possible for me because we hardly see each other and... Otherwise, everything's fine and I don't mind the way things are.

We had this... cleaning product, which was too strong. And whenever we used it, our hands would chap really badly. But some things were really dirty, so we had to use it. Didn't one of your colleagues have... -Yes. What did she have? She had eczema, it was more... It affected her nerves. What do you think about your job in general? I like it well enough. I'm satisfied at the moment. I can't complain. But one time you came home and told me that your back hurt. It's all that scrubbing. So why did you stop working as a seamstress? Do you like cleaning better? I wouldn't go so far as to say better. But back then... And... I had stomach problems back then. What did you want to become? -A hairdresser. A hairdresser? -Yes. Couldn't you find an apprenticeship? -No. You could have had a go at home. Had a go at home? Then you have a go here as a nurse. Whenever I'm really sick, you're never around. That's not true. -Most of the time. But not all the time. While we're on the subject, miss, you're getting home very late. Are you really just out with Marina? I could say that too. You never give me a proper answer either. It's exactly the same. -Why? I always give you an answer. Always? As if. Even if it was just yes or no. But you always want this or that and tell me you're not happy. I never said that. You're confusing me with my brother. Then give me a proper answer to my question. What do you want to know then? What do you mean? -It's always the same. You never give me an answer. It's not the same. -You do that instead. And then I have to go. Of course it's the same. It is to me, anyway. -Not to me. I'd also like to know why you don't do things the way I ask you to. That's totally different. -Is it? It's not different. Of course it's different. -No! If I ask you a question, I don't tell you to do this or that. Now I'd like an answer: why do you always get home so late? You know all the things that have been happening lately. I told you I was going for a walk with Marina for a few hours when we went out at seven. I'd like an answer now. -So would I. Forget it. SUNDAY The journey from San Francisco or Los Angeles to Hawaii is barely further than from Frankfurt to Las Palmas. Honolulu: vibrant and entertaining, embodying the spirit of aloha. Beach life among palm trees, bronzed hula dancers, exotic cocktails, entertainment Las Vegas style. Candle-light dinners, cool drinks and hot beats. Neon Fata morgana shining in the desert. You should love nature and wish to experience it. Andalucia Plaza, El Paradiso. This day in the midst of an utterly unique universe will be an experience to remember. THE MOTHER WOULD LIKE CARMEN TO BE THE DANCER MARIKA RÖKK OR CARMEN JONES FROM THE FILM Make sure to start every day with a happy face. Leave nothing to be desired. Enchanted like a smile. Her eyes had never been more beautiful. False eyelashes. Pamper yourself with some perfume. In the morning and the evening. After your bath. A mysterious veil of scent envelops you for hours. And hours and hours. And hours. And hours. And hours. SUNDAY What did you use to do when you had a boyfriend? We went dancing. -I bet you did more than that. We went to the club. What kind of club? A club where people dance. So you think having a boyfriend will somehow make you better? Well, what was it like when you were young? You don't usually find an excuse for it either. Oh well. You don't usually find an excuse for it either. Oh well. You don't usually find an excuse for it either. Oh well. You don't usually find an excuse for it either. Oh well. I like reading romantic novels. There's always a happy end, but... I don't pay much attention to what happens in between. I only care about the end. A happy end means overcoming difficulties and being together. A happy end means being able to do everything that I wish for. I'd... like to have a quiet life. Without arguments. And... a great love. A HAPPY END MEANS OVERCOMING DIFFICULTIES AND BEING TOGETHER I OFTEN THINK OF HAWAII...
