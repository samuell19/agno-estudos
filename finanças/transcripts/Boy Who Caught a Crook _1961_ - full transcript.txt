Hey, why don't you come with me? Sure sounds appetizing-- nah! What would your ma think, you bringing home an old tramp for a handout?Mom's not like that. She's been after me to bring my friends home. Says I shouldn't be by myself too much while she's workin'. Besides, you're no tramp-- you're my neighbor. And neighbors are always visiting each other's houses. Well, I ain't exactly dressed for callin'. You know, I think it's hotcakes and honey this mornin', homemade. Oh, I don't know.

Yeah, if we could find out who it belongs to. There might even be some kind of a reward. We'll be partners and split it, right down the middle. What do ya say?It's a deal. Now, I say we go over to the gas station, deliver the last paper and then see what's inside, hmm? Right, partner. Now, you wait outside here and see that I'm not disturbed. Combination's take concentration. Got a nickel? ♪♪ Maybe we'll get that reward sooner than we think. Did you lose somethin', Mister? Beat it, will ya.Maybe I can help you find it. Will ya beat it? Hey, Mister, there's somebody in there. How ya doin' in there?[Colonel] I'm still tryin'! That thing you lost, Mister, would there be any reward? Get lost, will ya? Hey, Mister! Wait a minute! Hey, if you're lookin' for a brown leather... Well, kid, we can kiss the reward money "good-bye." We hit a duster. Yeah, I know and the guy who lost it was here lookin' for it. But as soon as I mentioned the word "reward", he got scared and left. Hmm, that's funny. Well, you can keep the case anyway, it'd come in handy for your books or for your Ma to pack your lunch. Mom-- I forgot all about Mom! She's waitin' for us! We'd better be on our way and on the double! Oh, well you-- You'd better go on ahead. I ain't so good at runnin' up those steep streets anymore. I'll take a raincheck on the pancakes. Tomorrow, promise?Promise. Okay-- Thanks for the briefcase and for helpin' me out with the papers. I'm sorry about your part of the reward. See ya tomorrow, huh?Okay, see ya, Colonel. [Jimmy] Mom? In the kitchen, Jimmy and don't slam the door! [door slams] Sorry, Mom. No, no, no, hands first. You're late. It didn't take all that time to deliver those papers. Well, The Colonel and me, we found a really neat--"The Colonel and I." How do you think I felt with those sirens screaming all morning not knowing where you were? You hear 'em, too? You should've seen 'em, mom, the way the cops was chasin' this guy! Yeah, I heard about the way "the cops was chasin' this guy" on the radio. Now tell me, why were you late? Well, the Colonel and I-- Say, Mom, I invited the Colonel over for breakfast in the morning, after papers. I guess so, if you'll chaperone. Nothin' like that, Mom. He's too old for you. But not for you, eh?Well, that's different-- We're business partners. Oh, I see! Are you making any money? Well, our first deal kinda fell through but I came out with a keen briefcase. You wanna see it?No-- After breakfast. Mind if we listen to the radio? After breakfast I said. Well, I'd like to hear more about that guy they were chasin'. They catch him?I don't think so-- Now go on! Eat your breakfast, Jimmy! [Radio] ....and accompany him to the Moneyland office on Ivar Street in Hollywood. There he forced the teller to put $100,000 into a brown leather attache case. [radio] After leaving the office of the--Hey, Mom! Mom, come here, quick! [radio] Gray mercury sedan. [Jimmy] Mom, listen to this, will ya? I've already heard the news. Now go on-- I have work to do! But, mom, the briefcase I told ya about, it's just like the one they described on the radio. What do you mean? Well, I think I got the briefcase they used in the robbery this morning. Where is it?In my newspaper bag. Oh, Jimmy. Uh, hello, police department? But, Mom, I found it! Honest I did, in the weeds by the gas station. And the man that lost it doesn't even want it! Uh, hello, this is Mrs. Laura Fellows. I'm at 641 Bunker Hill Avenue. Yes, I think that my little boy has found the briefcase you're looking for. Yes, i-it's brown like you said on the radio. Yes, yes it has. Yes, we'll be here. Thank you very much. Goodbye. Now, Jimmy... Tell me about the man. Well, I was tryin' to give it back to him, but all of a sudden he took off. Did he have a scar on his face? How did you know, Mom? Jimmy, when the police get here-- now, I want you to think very carefully, answer their questions, be honest and tell everything exactly as it happened. But don't tell them about the man with the scar. Why not, Mom? Well, you see he's a dangerous criminal. He's escaped. And I'm afraid of what he might do to you if he finds out that you've talked to the police. Do you understand?Sure, Mom-- And I'd better get right over and warn The Colonel-- He's in danger too. Well, I'm more concerned about you, right now. So y-you answer their questions and be calm and don't get nervous.Okay, Mom. Can we keep The Colonel's name out of this, too? Of course, darling. [knocking] Oh, there they are. Oh, my pancakes! All right, son, will you show us how you found this, what position it was in? From the looks of the scratches and the stains on the back and those foxtails embedded in the leather, I'd say it was thrown here with a great deal of force, probably from the direction of 1st Street. It could've been thrown from the suspect's car during the chase. Yeah, but why throw an empty briefcase? If he were caught with the money on him, it wouldn't make any difference. Maybe it wasn't empty. Maybe he figured he was gonna get caught, wanted to get rid of the evidence here in the weeds and come back and pick it up later. There's one hole in that theory, Sergeant. The briefcase was locked when my teller handed it to the gunman. Now, I'll grant you it's not much of a lock, but, I think you'll agree you'd hardly have time to unlock a strange combination with the flower of the Los Angeles police force in hot pursuit! What's your point, Flannigan? My point is, I don't think he'd come here to the middle of a vacant lot in front of God and all those windows, and with the streets crawling with police cars, and patiently open the combination to the lock of the briefcase! And it's a job that would take an expert five minutes-- unpack $100,000 worth of cash into his pockets and leave the briefcase here for the first newsboy to come along to find it. He's got a point, all right. You'd better tell them about The Colonel, Jimmy. [Flannigan] I should say he'd probably go somewhere where he'd be alone, tear open the briefcase, take out the money and hide the case in the nearest trash can! And you think the money was in the case when it landed here? It'd almost have to be! Well, it's unlocked now. Did you unlock the case when you found it, son? Answer the Sergeant, Jimmy. I'm sorry-- I didn't hear ya. [Sergeant] I asked if you opened this briefcase when you found it. No, sir. Was there anybody else around here when you picked it up? Tell them about The Colonel, Jimmy. There's nothing to tell-- The Colonel and me-- and I, was deliverin' my newspapers together, that's all. He didn't have anything to do with it. Who's The Colonel? The Colonel's my dog-- He's my dog! Somethin' wrong, kid?Go away. I'd think you'd better let him alone. But the kid's my friend-- Maybe I can help! I don't know ya-- Go away. All right, Mister, move on-- Go on about your business. Well, Jimmy, you did a fine job finding that briefcase and calling the police as soon as you did. I'd call it, "information leading to the arrest of the suspect." and, uh, I think Mr. Flannigan here might have a reward for ya. How 'bout it, Flannigan? You know better than that, Connors. You might embarrass the boy. Tell ya what, you, uh, give Jimmy a reward and I'll match it personally. You heard him. Here you are, Jimmy-- $100. Thanks, Mr. Flannigan. Wait a minute, $100-- I was talkin' about five. Pay up, big mouth. Eighteen bucks-- Tell ya what, Jimmy, you let me take a picture of Mr. Flannigan here giving you the reward money, and I'll come by your house before dinner tonight with another $100 bill just like it. What do ya say? You men are gonna spoil him rotten. He'll be impossible to live with. This is just the beginning. Wait'll you see the lead line that goes with this picture, "Times newsboy scoops Times reporter." What am I laughing about-- This might cost me my job. All right, hold it. Good. Well, thanks for your cooperation, Mrs. Fellows. I hope I haven't upset your boy too much. Oh, no, little boys have a way of bouncing back. You can see he's all smiles again. Yeah, I know, I've got two of 'em myself. We may want to talk to him later today, though. Oh, we'll be at home. Come on.Good-bye. Oh, uh, can I give you a lift up the hill, Mrs. Fellows? No, no, it isn't very far-- We'll walk. Then I'll, uh, see you around 6:00 with the reward. Good-bye.Thank you-- Bye-bye. Oh, uh, Jimmy be sure and have your dog there. I'd like a picture of the little Colonel for the morning paper. Bye.Bye-bye. That's what comes from not telling the truth. Yes, Mom. I'm ashamed of you, Jimmy-- Such a bold lie! You've never done anything like that before. Why did you do it? I just couldn't help it, Mom. The way they were figurin' it out, The Colonel had to have taken the money. You see, the briefcase was locked when we found it and The Colonel opened it in the gas station. Were you there when he opened it? No. That's when I was talking to the man with the scar. Jimmy, we've got to call the police. Don't you see, darling, The Colonel took the money. I know it looks that way, Mom, but there wasn't any money. I know there wasn't! The Colonel showed me the case when he came out and it was empty. Well, he might've had it in his pockets or-or his shirt. You just don't know The Colonel, Mom, that's all. He just wouldn't do anything dishonest. Well, maybe you're right. He certainly seems to have convinced you. So, you, uh, two are business partners, huh? That's right, Mom. Well, you certainly should be successful. Can I go out for awhile, mom? I have to go over to The Colonel's house. After the way I had to treat him today, out in front of all those people, he's probably takin' it pretty hard. Jimmy, you mean to tell me that he was out there in that vacant lot today and he didn't say anything? Yeah. The guy with the beard like and the sloppy lookin' hat. The one who came up when-- oh, yes, the-the old tramp with the package-- That's The Colonel? He's no tramp, Mom. Please can I go out to see him? I think you've seen enough of The Colonel for today. You'd better go to your room. Oh, Jimmy! Look, I just don't understand it, t-this strange fascination that you have with this neighborhood tramp! I-I forbid you to see him again. It's just got to stop! Now you go out and find some boys your own age to play with. Oh, it's-it's telling such a preposterous lie! And to the police! Well, you heard the Sergeant say that he wanted to-to talk to you again. What are you going to say when-when he asks you about your dog? What are you going to say when Mr. Connors comes to see you? Oh, darling, don't you see? You're getting deeper and deeper by trying to protect The Colonel, darling. He didn't take it. Well, if he didn't take it, then why did he just stand there and let them ask you all the questions? If there's nothing wrong, why didn't he speak up, huh? I bet I know the answer. I bet he has the money, all right. I bet he's on his way to Australia or Brazil. What did he have in that package? I bet it was a suit, for traveling. Oh... Yeah, he'll be down there living a life of luxury and you, you'll be here trying to dodge juvenile hall just because you were perjuring yourself trying to save his skin. All right, now, give me that reward money. I'm going to put it under "M", for Money. And when the banks open up it's going into your account. For a rainy day. Now, go on out and find yourself some kids your own age to play with. I just hope that there'll be better days very soon. And, There'll be no visiting The Colonel, understand? Yes, ma'am. ♪♪ [barking, howling] Get back now-- Get back, Get back! Don't be so greedy-- There's plenty of food here for everybody. Now, come on! Well, you lookin' for a dog, short stuff? I sure am. [man] Well, we're closed. What kinda dog you lookin' for, son? A dog that'll answer to the name of "Colonel." Well-well, now I'm not on exactly on first name speakin' terms with these dogs. You see, they only stay in the pound for five days and then they leave us. Colonel, hmm. [man] Well, I ain't got a dog in the whole pound named Colonel. How long ago did you lose your dog? Well, I didn't lose him-- I'm just lookin' for any dog that'll answer to the name of "Colonel." Colonel-- Here, Colonel. Looks like you need a dog pretty bad, son. I gotta have a dog before I go home, Mister. Well, there's a lot of dogs in here, if you find one you want. Go ahead and look around. [man] I'll bet you'd keep a dog a lot longer than five days. Go ahead-- Look around. Go ahead.Thanks, Mister. [dog whimpering] Colonel? Now, most of the dogs in there ain't too friendly! [man] You keep your distance! Colonel-- Here, Colonel. Colonel? Colonel, don't you know me? If you'll just be friends and answer me, I'll take you home and build you a nice little dog house all of your own, and you can have all you want to eat. Colonel? Colonel-- Here, Colonel. [dog whimpering] There you are, Colonel-- Little Colonel! Well, it looks like you found your Colonel after all! I sure did-- Hello, Colonel! You wanna take him home with ya?I sure do! All right, we'll make out the papers, all legal like. Now, what's your name?Jimmy Fellows. "Jimmy Fellows", uh-huh-- address? 909 Bunker Hill Avenue. "909 Bunker Hill"-- All right! Now, you just sign right there. Lucky for him you came along when you did. That's his fifth day in the pound. Truck's comin' pretty soon to take him to where there's no tomorrow. [man] All right. Now, that'll be five dollars and the dog's yours. I'm sorry, Mister, but I didn't know you had to pay for a dog here. I ain't got five dollars. Oh! I got 23 cents. Could I leave this as a deposit and pay the rest later? It's against the rules. You mean, you have to put 'em away, even if they could have a good home, with plenty to eat, just for five dollars? I don't make the rules, I just follow them. If ever there was a rainy day, this is it. Little Colonel, don't you worry about a thing! I'll be right back with the money. You're gonna see the sun rise at Bunker Hill in the morning. How long you gonna be here, Mister? I'm leavin' just as soon as the truck comes for that dog. I can make it home and back in 30 minutes. Couldn't you stay open a little longer? [horn honking] [man] That's the truck for him now. [horn honking] Of course, now if you was to run out that side gate real fast... Why, I couldn't run and catch you now could I? Oh, thanks, Mister! All right!Thanks a lot! All right-- All right. Well, I guess this one's on me. [horn honking] Blow your horn, Gabriel-- Blow your horn! [Mrs. Fellows] That you, Jim? Yes, Mom. [doorbell buzzing] [doorbell buzzing] Good evening, Mrs. Fellows. Mr. Connors-- You didn't have to come. Oh, you mean I'm not welcome? You're twisting my words-- Come in. What I mean is that if it's about that $100 bill that you promised Jimmy... Well, we wouldn't want to hold you to that. After all, it was a very kind gesture on your part to try and cheer him up. That's not the real reason I came. No?No. You see, um, you won "The Times" contest as the best-looking mother on the vacant lot this morning. Oh, the only mother. Ah-ah-ah, the decision of the judges is final. Well, that's very kind of you. I, um, I'll put them in some water. Uh, by the way, would you like a cup of coffee? Oh, yes, uh-uh, black, please. Good-- Jimmy? Mr. Connors is here! Excuse me. Ah, hi, there, Jimmy. Hi, Mr. Connors. How are ya-- Nice to see ya. Oh, say, uh... I brought your reward just like I said I would. There you are-- One hundred dollars. Go on, take it-- Go on. Thanks, Mr. Connors.You're welcome, Jimmy. I got Colonel here for ya to see. [Mr. Connors] Oh, you have?Come on, Colonel. Ha, come here-- Come here. Come here. Hey, that's quite a hound. How long have you had it? Oh, not very long-- He's just a puppy. Oh? Mom, may I be excused? Here's the money from Mr. Connors. Well, doesn't seem like the same boy I met this morning. Did, uh, I come at a bad time? Well, it seems like a bit of, uh, an emotional upheaval. Oh.Um, perhaps I'd better go in and see if I can pour some oil on the troubled waters. Will you excuse me?You're sure I can't help? Oh, no, no-- I'll just be a minute. Thank you. Jimmy, don't you think you're being a little rude to Mr. Connors? After all, he was kind enough to bring you this $100. He can have it back. It's not mine, anyways-- It belongs to The Colonel. Oh, darling, Mother hates to see you so unhappy. Oh, come on. Give me a smile so I'll know you're not mad at me. I'm not mad at you, Mom. You think you're doing what's right. I just can't help thinkin' about how The Colonel must be feelin', after the way I had to treat him out there and right after invitin' him over to breakfast. How would you feel? I guess I'd feel pretty awful. And I can't even explain it to him. Well, maybe I've been wrong about The Colonel, Jimmy. If you really want to go see him, well, you go ahead. Invite him in the morning for breakfast too, huh? Thanks, Mom-- Thanks a lot! All right, darling. And don't you be to long now-- I want you back by 7:00, huh? Your dinner will be ready by then. Good night, Mr. Connors. And thanks for the reward money. I gotta go now-- Hope you can stay till I get back. Hey, how about that oil you poured. Say, can that be bottled and sold? I only hope I did the right thing. ♪♪ [groaning] So you're the squirt who found the briefcase, huh? I saw ya down there in the empty lot getting your picture taken. What did ya tell 'em? I didn't tell 'em anything about you, Mister. Honest, I didn't. It's a lucky thing for you you kept your mouth shut. Now I want some straight answers to some questions. When you found that briefcase, was it open or locked? You lie to me kid, you'll wish you hadn't. Was it open or locked? It was open. Did ya see anybody near it when you found it? Just you. Where was the briefcase, when I was talkin' to you? When I ask you a question, I want an answer, you hear? [dog growling] I'll shut you up for good! ♪♪ Well, isn't this interesting. Where's the rest of it? There isn't any more. Don't lie to me, kid-- Don't lie to me! Is this your mother? Would you like to keep her out of real bad trouble? Yes, sir. Then tell me where the rest of the money is. I'm tellin' the truth-- There isn't any more. Then where'd you get this? It's the reward money from findin' the briefcase. A hundred dollars? $100 for an empty $40 briefcase? What do you take me for? You listen to me and listen to me good. You have that money in this bucket by 12:00 tonight or you'll never see your mother again, understand? But, Mister, I don't got the money!Shh! And what's more, if you should think of callin' the cops, your mother'd have wished that you were never born. Do I make myself clear? Yes, sir.Remember, 12:00 tonight. [dog whimpering] [dog whimpering] I know you're here. Maybe I should've got on that truck with ya. Come on-- We're gonna go see The Colonel. [Mrs. Fellows] Jimmy's father was killed in Korea. Evacuating our troops during the big Chinese push. I might even have passed him somewhere, like ships in the night. But, I was luckier than he was. You know, uh, looking at you and your boy, he was pretty lucky too. I miss him so. In so many ways. I guess I mostly miss him not being here to share and help bring up his own son. Well, you seem to be doing a pretty good job of it. Well, he's wonderful company but, he does have his problems. Uh, more coffee? No thanks-- It might spoil my dinner. Say, you sure you won't change your mind about the three of us going out to dinner? No, some other time-- I've already started my dinner. Which reminds me, I'd better go look at it. Well, dinner's almost ready-- I wish Jimmy was here. You know, I should be on my way. Except, uh, if it's all the same with you, I'd just as soon wait until he comes home. Oh, thank you-- I wish you would. You know, I just don't feel right about letting him out alone before this robbery's solved. I'm worried. Well, I've been a little worried myself but I didn't to upset you. You know, the whole thing down in the vacant lot just didn't ring true. I keep thinking there's more to it than what's on the surface. I just hope this crook, whoever he is, has the money and is safely on his way to wherever he's going. Well, why'd you say that? Because if Flannigan was right, and the crook didn't get the money, he's probably gonna hang around the neighborhood 'til he finds out who did. I wish I knew where that man lived.Who? Jimmy's friend-- the one he went to see. Um, would you eat with us? There you see I have upset you after all. Well, Jimmy's probably just fine and having a wonderful time while we're here worrying. Tell you what-- you got a deck of cards? We can play gin rummy until he comes in. Oh, good! Here we are, right here. Ah! You wanna watch me-- I'm pretty sharp at this. Mr. Connors--Burt. Well, Burt... I, uh... I wonder if I could trust you with a confidence. Oh, thou shalt not confide in a newspaper man-- eleventh commandment. Well, I suppose you are the last person in the world that I should confide in, but I don't know-- somehow I trust you. You see, it's about the briefcase. Colonel? I'm here. In the parlor. You leavin'? Yup. Australia? Or Brazil? Doesn't make much difference to you, does it? Didn't expect to see you again... After the vacant lot. That's what I came to explain about. Oh... You don't have to explain. I don't blame you for being ashamed of me. Especially in front of all those people. And your mother. [Jimmy] That's not the reason! The police figured the money was locked in the briefcase when it was thrown in the vacant lot. I had to tell 'em it was open when we found it. If they knew it was locked, and you unlocked it, you'd be in jail right now. Oh. That's why I lied, and said I never saw ya before, and that The Colonel was my dog. And that's why I got him. Come here. Then you're... you're not ashamed of me? You was-you was just tryin' to protect me? We still partners? That's a nice new suit you have on. Yeah! You like it? I got it so as to look respectable in front of your mom when I come to breakfast tomorrow morning. I hawked my violin to get it. Hmm, now that she's already seen what a tramp I am, I wished I hadn't. You didn't buy it... to go away? No! I just didn't want ya to be ashamed in front of all your friends anymore. [Jimmy] I'd never be ashamed of you, Colonel. I've got $100 bill at home. I'll bring it to ya so you can get your violin back. Now, where did you get it? It's yours-- your half of the reward money for finding the briefcase. No! You keep it. You may need it to help you get through college one of these days. No! I'll bring it to you. Anyway, I ain't even gonna live to go to college. I ain't even gonna live to a rainy day. Now-now, why would you say a thing like that? The scarface man told me. I just got 'til midnight tonight. If I don't get the money from the briefcase to him by then-- He thinks you got the money? Well, did-did-did you go to the police? No! They'll think you had it. But the briefcase was empty when I opened it! But the police would never believe that! No. No, they wouldn't. I... I oughta go to 'em and... Tell 'em the whole truth, but... I just can't, kid. I... I ain't never had the courage to face up to responsibilities. I guess that's... Why I'm nothin' but an old tramp. Somethin'... Somethin' seems to turn yellow inside of me. I'm-- Well, I'm... I'm a coward. I'm your... fair weather friend. Well, everybody can't be a hero, Colonel. Just don't worry. They'll never know you had anything to do with the briefcase. They think you're my little dog. Well, I gotta go home now to look after Mom. I'll leave little Colonel here to look after you. You can bring him with you when you come to breakfast in the morning. That is... If I'm still around. ♪♪ You can call it, uh, woman's intuition, or just plain cowardice, but I-I can't help worrying about what that scarface man might do if he thought that Jimmy identified him to the police. Oh, I've talked so long. I wish Jimmy was here! Laura... Since you were asking my advice, I-I think you made a mistake by not letting Jimmy tell the truth in the first place. By now, the suspect might've been behind bars. But the worst part was letting him keep The Colonel out of it. He's the key to the whole case. Oh, but he-he was so convinced that The Colonel was innocent. Well, he has to learn the lessons of human nature sometime. It might as well be while he's young. Sit down, Laura. I, uh, I hate to be an alarmist but, uh, Well, I don't think it's safe for Jimmy to be without police protection as long as the suspect's still at large. Right now, he's the crook's only link with the missing money. Why don't you and I pay a visit to the Sergeant, right now. I just-- Well, I just couldn't face Jimmy when he got back. It'd break his heart. I know this is brutal, Laura, but better a broken heart than a broken neck. Here, you can leave him a note. All right. There. I'm always wondering whether I'm doing the right thing or not. This time you are. We'd better go. You sure you won't change your mind again? Well, I'll talk to the Sergeant, Burt, but not behind Jimmy's back. Would you mind driving me home? We can bring him back down with us. I'm sure he's there by now. He's a lucky boy having you for a mother. Mom, you home? Well, hello. How many more are there? That's the last one, Mister. Honest-- There isn't any more! We'll see. [car approaching] Not a peep outta you. I'll go in alone. I can talk to him much better that way. Take your time. Do as your told and nobody gets hurt. Over there. So far I got two $100 bills from your boy. That leaves $998 more. Where are they? I told you those bills were given to me for a reward. I never saw the rest of the money. I'm talkin' to your mother! How 'bout it lady? We don't know anything about the money. If we did, we'd give it all to you, all of it! It isn't here! We don't know anything! I throw a locked briefcase with 100,000 clams into a vacant lot in the weeds. The kid and the dog find it. The kid brings it home. Then I find these two like rabbit's out of a hat. What kind of a chump do you take me for? The money's gotta be someplace! It couldn't have just disappeared! Or maybe your dog, the Colonel, may-maybe he found it. Where is he-- I'll ask him. You'd better tell him, Jimmy. Tell him what, Mom? About the Colonel. He's got to take his share of the responsibility. You can't go on covering up for him. I told ya, Mom. The Colonel didn't have anything to do with it. [Rocky] Enough double-talk. What about this "Colonel?" Don't tell him, Mom. Don't! The Colonel is Jimmy's friend. They found the briefcase together. But The Colonel is the one who opened the briefcase. My boy doesn't know anything about it. Come here, kid-- Come here. Come here. Come here. Your dog, huh? No! Look out-- Where is this Colonel? Where does he live? Go ahead and kill me. I won't tell you anything. Why you--No, don't! No, stop it-- He'll tell you! Well, go ahead, Jimmy. You've got to tell him. Tell him where The Colonel lives, darling. He's gone. He moved to-- I don't know where he is. You lyin'-- [door buzzing] Laura? Not a sound now or the kid gets it. Whoever it is, get rid of 'em, or you'll never see this kid alive. Who is it? It's me, Connors. What do you want? Well, what do you mean, "What do I want?" I'm waiting for you, remember? I can't see you. Go away! Is something wrong in there? What's going on? Please! Go away! Go away, please! Please! You all right? Where's Jimmy? What is it, Laura? My boy, he's got my boy! Who's got your boy? What happened? That man with the scar, he has Jimmy! Hello? Give me the police, and hurry! I guess you'll have to say goodbye to the kid for me. Goin' somewhere? I didn't wanna bring him here, Colonel. He made me. He's got a gun. And don't force me to use it. Get back inside. Let's see that suitcase. Untie it. Open it! Where is it? Where's the money? Honest, Mister, I... I ain't got a dime to my name. I told ya he didn't have the money. Come here. Not you, squirt! You. Well... Well, no-no need to treat the kid that way. Shut up. Take it off. The pants, too. Huh? The pants! Come on, come on! All right, where is it? But-but I told you, Mister, I-I don't know. Th-there wasn't any money. Look, I haven't got all night. I'm gonna get that money from you, if I have to beat you and break every bone in your body! Well? Please don't hurt me, Mister. I ain't got your money. Ah! Your turn is next! Well? [groaning] [puppy growling] [puppy barking] Where is it? No! Leave him alone! He doesn't know where the money is! Ah-- no-no! The suspect finally showed up here looking for the lost bank roll. When I came in, he got out the bedroom window and took Jimmy with him. Now, we think he's taken Jimmy to some tramp's home. It seems this tramp was with Jimmy when he found the, uh, briefcase and opened up the lock. But you don't know where this tramp lives, is that it? Well, Mrs. Fellows is sure it's in the immediate neighborhood, but that's about all you got to go on. It's not much. Probably some cheap flop in one of these rooming houses. There are plenty of those. Hide, get on the car radio. Ask for every available unit. I want Bunker Hill sealed off tight. Nobody leaves the area without proper identification. There must be 50, 60 houses on the hill. We're going through every one of 'em. But do it quietly. We don't want to scare him into any violence. Uh, pass the word he's got a kid with him too. Sergeant, do you think that he-- Mrs. Fellows, if he's armed, he's dangerous. We don't know what he'll do. Tell Clemmens to take this block-- Modrey, Bunker Hill, 1st and Maxwell. Now Burton and Stein, I want them to work Temple Street, both sides of the street, North from Court to the barricade. Johnson and Smith, South from Court to 5th. Tell them they'll have plenty of help by the time they get there. I want you to stick close to that radio in the car and within hollerin' distance of me. I'm gonna take the top of the hill. Now, one of you knows where that money is. For the last time, where is it? I...Where is it? All right... Now you. Nobody leaves this place alive unless I find that money. Now where is it? Where? [The Colonel] No! Wait... Wait I'll tell ya. I... I got it. I got your money. Where? The old Clancy place at the top of the hill. It's just a cellar now. The house is gone. Don't believe him. He's doin' it for me. There wasn't any money! There was money all right. Keep talkin'. I'm sorry, kid. I didn't deserve your confidence. I-I thought I could get away with it, and nobody'd know. I took it... at the gas station while you was outside and hid it in my shirt. As soon as I got to the house, I put the money in the violin and-- And then I buried the violin in the old Clancy place. All-all except $100. I took that straight downtown... And bought the suit. You can keep the suit as a present from me. How could you do it, Colonel? How could you? After all you always said about bein' honest and goin' straight, how could you let me lie to the police? And tell my mom how honest you were? While all the time you had the money buried in your violin. I believed in you. I trusted you. We were even partners! [Rocky] All right. Put this on and let's go. It's empty. Good thing when they tear these old slums down. Come on, kid-- We're movin' out. Come on, kid! No! The kid stays outta this! He didn't have anything to do with the money! I took it all by myself! You gotta let him go! So he can go screamin' like mad to the cops? The kid comes with us. No, the kid won't say a word! Tell him, kid! Tell him you won't! I will! No.I will! No!I hope they catch you... Both of ya!Please, kid, please, kid! Help-- Police!Please, kid! You-- Gag him, and make it tight! All right, that's good enough. Or I don't step one foot outta here. Move. Go ahead, but I'm not takin' one step outta here with the kid. Okay, Pop. The kid stays-- help me tie him to a chair. Make it tight. [Colonel] Sorry I let you down, kid. I'm sorry. [Rocky] That's good enough-- Let's go. I probably won't see ya again, kid. It's just as well. Old tramp like me'll never change, but you... You're gonna amount to somethin' some day. [Rocky] All right, cut the sermon. It won't be Sunday for two hours yet. So long, kid. Straight for the money and no tricks. And you better get that dog outta here. His yelps will bring in the whole neighborhood. [groaning] Move on! Keep low. ♪♪ Well, they can't just disappear. We're gonna drive over to your house. Would you like a ride? No thanks-- We'd rather walk. All right. How much further? End of the street. Let's go. Bunker Hill is like an island in a sea of lights. It seems impossible. Here we are surrounded by two million people. We're just a stones throw away from the civic center, the police headquarters, and yet some scarfaced criminal can hide my boy. [puppy whimpering] Listen. [puppy howling] It sounds like a dog. It's from over there. Why, it's the little Colonel. It's Jimmy's dog. Jimmy! [yelping] Jimmy? Jimmy? Oh, thank God! Mom, you were right! The Colonel did take the money! The Sergeant's at your house. I think we should get there as soon as we can. That it? Take me to the money. Mrs. Fellows and the boy. Give me the horn. This is car 17-- Car 17. The fellows boy has been found. More details later-- Over. You all right, son? Sure. And I know where the stolen money is too, Sergeant-- in a violin in an old basement. If you hurry you might get there in time. I'm afraid you found an empty briefcase, son. We picked up a wino down on main street. He had the money on him. If found the briefcase, picked the lock, took the money, and threw the briefcase back out on the lot. You found it later. We just heard it on the radio. But I heard The Colonel admit he took the money. And he told the scarfaced man where he hid it. Why would he lie about a thing like that, and say he buried it, if he didn't? He did it to save your life, darling. Then you gotta hurry. He's taking the crook there right now to show him where the violin is. Did he say where? In a basement at the old Cleary place, at the end of Bodrey Street. I can take you there. Get in-- give me the horn. This is car 17-- Car 17. Suspect is in the vicinity of East Bodrey in the basement of an old building. He's armed and dangerous. Approach with caution-- Over and out. Let's go. I... I-I-I can't remember! I'd-I'd... No, no, I think it was here. You've got one minute to produce that violin. Twenty-three seconds. The kid, you won't hurt him? Twenty seconds! [crying] All right... Go ahead and kill me. But you leave the boy alone, do you hear? Don't you dare touch that kid! He's worth 100 of you and me! [gunshot] You all right, Colonel?Yeah. Oh, I guess so. Hey, how did you ever find me? [Sergeant] We didn't-- your partner there did. Well, it wasn't all together me. It was the little Colonel who really did it. Oh, you mean, we gotta split three-ways now? New member of the firm. [chuckling] Well, come on, Colonel. Are... a-a-are you sure it'll be all right with your ma? Sure-- come on! The pancakes are waitin'. They're coming in now. Oh, don't slam the door! [door slams] Oh. Hi-- We're here, Mom.Yes, so I hear. I'm so glad you could come, Colonel. Mrs. Fellows. Here-- You men sit down now, and have your orange juice, and I'll get your pancakes. Jimmy.Here-- Can I put your hat up, Colonel? Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Here we go.Oh! Say, these look great! There. Holy cow! Well, look, Colonel. Wow! A thousand bucks! Mr. Flannigan brought it over while you were delivering your newspapers. It seems like the scarface man had a big price on his head. Looks like you hit the jackpot. There may be even more. We're rich, Colonel! Now you can get your violin outta hock, and buy all the new suits you want. I told you that you two were gonna be successful. Well, here's to the new firm... [puppy whimpering] ...And to all the new partners. [chuckling]
