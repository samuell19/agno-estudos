No, it's not True. -Come on. Moma. -I had to talk to Sven, didn't I? Henning. You're there. Listen, I have two children. -That's mine. You should have thought of that earlier. -Dirtbag. Stop it, brat. ON YOUR OWN Is your mother home? Your mother's name is Linda Holm Jensen? Yeah -We want to talk to her for a moment. Who are you guys? -Normal kids. Is that where she sleeps? -I'll get her. The police are here. -That's what I heard. I'll be there in two minutes. -Good. What are they doing? -To take me with them. Can I borrow your makeup? Are you going to jail? I should have gone there yesterday. I totally forgot. We'll come and see you. -Too far away. What about us? They will put you in an orphanage or something. Bye. Take it easy. Mommy, can I come? -No, darling, you're too big for that. The last time you were just born. Mom, my tooth is loose. I don't want to go to a home again. -It's only for a week. We don't want to go to a home again. Kasper. -We stay here. Alone? That is not possible. -I'll take care of us. Are you coming? -Say something to them. What then? -Just say something polite. It's only a week, you say so yourself. -The girls are too small. And their father? I asked him. He doesn't have time. What if I had a father? -But you don't have any, do you? But if we pretend. -You don't have a father. The police don't know that. Then you guys could have fun, huh? Would you like a beer? -No, thank you. Do you want a beer then? -No me neither. Would you like one? -No. Not in the morning. Mommy wants to tell you something. Where is your father? -In that room. He's asleep. Beautiful. He's going to look after us. My father. Not my sisters'. Let's go. -May I say goodbye? My husband. This is our little secret, don't give it away, huh? We really have to go. See you in a week, sweetheart. And take good care of the kids. And just snoring. He's the biggest sleepyhead I know. But very nice, and a good cook. -Aha. Potato salad and so on. Give this money to daddy. Tell him that he has to pay the phone bill. Forgetful, but gentle to children. It'll be worst with me. We leave now. And be careful, huh. -All right, Mommy. And don't argue, Sara. If you can do it, you'll be my greatest treasure. Just go. Let's go. -Don't let strangers in, huh. You'll be fine. Let's go. -But I have to... Bye, Mommy. I'll call you. I want mommy back. Kasper, Julie's crying. Let's have fun, Julie. Come on, let's play with Kasper's father. That's nice. -I want another house. Those kids... I don't have time now, Per. -I've got to get out of there, otherwise... Do you have poop in your ears or something? -No. Maybe you? You promised me a new home. -Just go back to watching TV. Is there nothing on Eurosport? -Why don't you keep your appointment? I have to move some children out of the house. Their mother is away for a while. So I have to get them into a home. Sort of like you. If you don't behave, you have to get back behind bars. You're a bad person. Hi, Kasper. Do you remember who I am? -We don't want to go to a home. I'll come and see who's looking after you. -You don't have to. It's for your own good. -We never want to go to a home again. But you had a good time last time, didn't you? Remember that one, Kasper? I have to do my job too, Kasper. My father is looking after us. -Then I want to talk to him. He's in the bathroom. -Ask him if he has a moment. Who was that? -That home lady. Dad? -Yes, my son. There is someone from the government who wants to speak to you. But I have no clothes on. But she really wants to talk to you. Surely that's not possible when I'm not wearing pants? What should I say to her? She should come back another day. Okay, I'll do that. Another day is better. -Does it take that long? Yeah, well. He's very dirty. He doesn't have a bath at home. He's all black around his neck. -Yeah, Yeah. Will you be home tomorrow afternoon? Are you at home then? You heard him say no, didn't you? -I am not deaf. Keep your hands off it. What's this? -The key. I'll be back the day after tomorrow. Julie, look. This is today. Mommy will be back in seven days. Good. Want more milk with your popcorn? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven days. Then mommy comes back. Bye, Kasper's father. -Bye, Kasper's father. Bye, Kasper's... Bye, Daddy. Looks great on you, that lipstick. Is your mother gone? Yes, I help my father with babysitting. -Is he back? And we're allowed to eat messy food, -And jump on the beds. So, you may. Good for you, Kasper. Bye, Sara. -I have a little secret. Tell me. Tell me. -Please. No, because then it will no longer be a secret. -Come on. Shut up, you promised. -I didn't say anything, did I? Promise not to say anything. -All right. No. Like this: my word of honor. My word of honor. I wonder if you know what I think and if you know what I dream about I wonder if you know what I think and if you know what I dream about give me one last chance Dinner is ready. -Who's that peeper across the street? The new resident. -He killed somebody. Well, no. He's coming out of jail, mom says. She says that as a joke. Is he a child molester then? -No. Come on. What are we eating? -Wine gum stew. Yummy. -I love stew 'Have you forgotten Christmas Eve, Miss Edelburg? ' ... asked Miss Nielsen with a trembling voice. I was convinced that Erna's death was imminent. Give me your wrist. I'll be my father. And then you have to try to get loose. You see, there's no way out. One of his moves. -And then your dad handcuffed him? Yes, and then the police came. Beautiful. Elton, can you continue reading? -Only If you pay. Shall I go to the school counselor? Or am I not disruptive enough? -Sit down. I demand that Elton be removed. Damn, a flying snot bubble. My father is very strong, admit. -Mine too. You don't have a father at all. -Well... He even lives with us now. I put it in the dryer. Are you alone? -My father will be here soon.

Wait, there must be more money in it. Damn. Kasper? Listen, something very unfair has happened. But heads up... -Don't you come home? Of course. But it takes time. All of a sudden I have to serve all my provisional sentences. Will you come tomorrow? -No. It takes a little longer. When will you come home? In three weeks, Kasper. Wait a minute, we're out of money. But you're gonna be okay, right? -Mommy. Look. My tooth is out. Oh, is that you, Sara? What are you doing? Stop that. They are not allowed inside. -Who? They are not allowed inside. Let go of me. -Then stop. If they come... -No one comes. Don't scream like that. Nothing happens as long as I look after you. I don't like it. -Go back in your bed. You can't hit my sister. -Stop. In your bed. Stop. -Let go of him, Julie. Hush now. Shall we go lie down in mommy's bed? -Good.

Say it. Otherwise you are not allowed to come to our birthday party. So what? -But everyone is invited. Gee. -Say it then. ...the police came. -I get it. One of his moves. -My dad caught two bank robbers. When they came in, he grabbed their bag, knocked them down... and then the money flowed out. Hi, Kasper. -Would he keep some money? Come here a minute. Who's that? -Some stupid lady. I had some time, so I thought: How would it be with Kasper and his father? I'll take you home. -I have to pick Julie up. Then we drive past her school. Great car. For in the city. Front-wheel drive? I don't know. -That's okay. I'll come with you. Not a good idea. -Yeah, there's plenty of room. No. Come out. It's just a stupid Toyota. -I'll see you later, then? No, my father needs to sleep. -Then we'll be quiet. Are your sisters happy too that your dad's home? Is his surname also Holm Jensen?

They don't answer. -Call tomorrow. Maybe they're in that home. -Wasn't their father with them? Please, can I call them? -Tomorrow. And if they never come home, asshole? Guess who I am? -Kasper's father. Three guesses. Per, don't do that horrible act. Next time I have another house... or I'll kill you. -I wouldn't do that. I want to speak to the boy's father. Do you know him? Yeah. Big, glassy look. -Have you seen him? Yeah. -When will he be home? Always. -Always? You can see him. Just get out of here, Per. You've got no business here. What about you?

Can you lend me some money? I only have nine crown. -What about your father? All he has is a credit card, and he wants to know what it's for. Say for poor children. -Don't fall for it. What have you got there? Nothing. -Let's see. Don't touch it, you idiot. I won't talk to you anymore. What's wrong with you? Do you really want to know? -Yeah, tell me. I'm sick of all that whining about you and your dad. You're a friend of nobody. Why didn't you go home? Everyone's had a card. A card? What is it for? For the twins' party. -I don't have one. What losers. That's what I'm going to tell mom. Tell them not to come to your party. They don't care. If you could make a wish... except Mommy came home... what would you wish for then? Don't you have to go home? You have to leave now, it's six o'clock. No one's waiting for you? -Julie. Locked. -She went to the home. Don't talk like that. Get in. Look, there they are. -Get in, Julie. Where were you guys? You could have been dead, you idiot. Calm down. -But she's not looking. We waited for three quarters of an hour. -We were held up on the way. By what, Kasper? -Nothing. Does your father take good care of you? -He's not here at all. What about your father? -Nothing. Say it. -Don't you two get along? Just tell. -It's going well. Shall I talk to him? -Can't. I'll go in with you. -Good. Then you can give us food. -Daddy already has a girlfriend. That's not the point. If you steal those keys, you won't be out of here for a while. I have to go to my family. -Give it back to me. But I didn't do anything. -Oh no? My children didn't do anything. Please, can I go home? The keys. I have to go home. My kids are already... in a home perhaps. Sara can't stand that. Understand that. You're not getting those keys. No way. You get three months. All right, then. I borrowed it from school. -May I? Can't Mommy call? -No, the bill hasn't been paid. Can't we just pay? -Not without money. How does the phone know? -Don't be stupid. Kasper did not pay. Mama should have paid. We want to drink. -I'm hungry. I am so hungry. Are we going to eat like this? Whining. -I want something with onions. Keep your mouth shut. Sara? Julie? What are you doing here? Where are they? -I don't know. Don't disturb me. Go away. You can see I'm an important murder... I'm plotting. Look, there he is. Where have you been? That you dared to go in there. -Sure I did. Where were you guys? You were so mean to us... -That we've been hiding. Grab your stuff, we're going to see your father. What should I say? -Hello, we've come to say hello. Does he know we're coming? -No, it's a surprise. You're coming too, huh? Yes, to give you a night kiss. Then I'm going home. No, you should stay too. -Here it is. Then we eat eggs and bacon. -I have to go home, Julie. What do you have to do there? -Take care of my father. We'd better leave the bags here. All right, we'll do that. You ring the doorbell. Hello, we've come to say hello. What do you want? Is something wrong? -I'm not Sara. Hi, Daddy. Hello. I don't want them inside. -It can't be left outside. They were the world's strongest shoes, weren't they? You let them freeze here? I don't mean those shoes. Just stop it. Come on in for a minute. What I wanted to ask: Can the girls stay here for a while? And get some food? What did she do this time? She certainly doesn't dare to call herself, does she? Our phone is broken. It's your birthday? -No, it's our baby's birthday. Yes, we got one. Tuesday was her birthday, So I'm sorry, but... Did she arrive Tuesday? -No. Think about the guests? -Yes. No, she's two now.

Can we play with her? Not today. Another day maybe. Can I have cake? Candles. No, it's for the guests. If someone doesn't like it, Can I have his piece? I don't think so. Can we borrow money? Tell your mother I already deposited two weeks ago. But we only borrow. You'll get it back. Could be, but it's the principle that matters to me. Shall we get our bags? -No, let's go. We're going now. Come on, let's go. Daddy, when are you coming to live with us again? I can't do that. -And if we were all alone... without food and money? Allan. -Sara, come on. Feel free to take your little one with you. -Listen, tell your mother... that she shouldn't use you to extort money from me. Sara, come on. What ugly shoes you have. Where is the phone? Where is the phone? Do you have the phone? -For me? No, did you take it? -I haven't even heard it. If I need it, it's gone. -Isn't it just on your desk? Did you look closely? -Sure, I'm not crazy. That is not certain. Isn't it there? -No, there... What's that? -That's a phone. Vacation would do you good. -But it was really gone. Sorry, I need it. With Preben Underg?rd.

Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. Did I do something wrong? Better watch out in the future, huh, otherwise you might hurt yourself badly. Will you promise me that, boy? Bye. Is this the right way to the station? -No, you have to go this way. No, excuse me. I didn't mean it that way. Stop. Hold still.

That's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about Sit down. I bought some sandwiches. What cute sisters you have. How do you like it here? Ordinary. -But it's not for little children. Yes, it is. Your sisters don't have much to say about your father. And he doesn't appear in my papers either. Go. -I don't think your father lives here. Well. -What time is he coming? Four o'clock. -Then I'll come back at four. If he's not here then, I will take measures. See you girls in an hour or two. What does 'measures' mean? -A children's home. You're not going there. I'll find a dad. Who? Hang on a second. He is not at home. It is important. I'm not at home, didn't she say? -You need to come at 4 o'clock. I'm fed up with your mother's tricks. Sorry, it's not your fault either. You only have to watch them for an hour. -You're old enough to do it yourself. Can I pee? I wanted to ask you something. -Come on. You can sit behind me. Come on. -Your dad, huh... Well? -Does he have something to do around four o'clock? Will there be any more? -Don't worry. Does he have what? I don't know. Just an hour. -He can't right now. Why not? -I haven't seen him in a while. How long? -Almost four years. Are you coming with me? No. Go ahead. You wanted to help me with whatever it was, didn't you? Is that still true? -What's it about? I'm going to talk to them for a while, and then you can lock up the house. Hello. -Hi. And are you ready? What for? -Have you packed your bags yet? Let's go. Come on. They are so looking forward to seeing you. What's that? Kasper's father. -What did you say? Kasper's father. Has anyone seen my glasses? Good day. I was in the bath for a moment. I'm sorry. Yes, that has to be done too. Flemming Poulsen? That is correct. -Anne Marie Hets-Trolle. You told them that they have to go to a home? Well, I didn't say they were going to a... home. But I think... that it's all based on a misunderstanding. That's all right. Boy, Kasper really has a father. -That's what I said the whole time. We did it, great. And? -What's up, Per? Our appointment. -What about? Another house. -Do I have time for. I said: Otherwise I'll kill you. -Stop with that nonsense. Nonsense? -We'll figure it out. And we'll keep calm.

Their father was there. What the hell, Dad. A teddy bear. -Not funny, Per. I haven't hurt anyone yet. Not yet. You're doing fine, Linda. -I don't dare go home. Let's go. -And if they're not there? Just hurry up. Did you know I was coming today? -Sure. Wonderful. I thought for a moment: You've been taken away. No, I'm not. And I call. -I forgot the bill. And two men stole the TV. What?
