No... Another plate for... No. Sorry. Aren't you going to open that package ? No. I'm going to open it. Okay ? Okay. Yes, that's a great gift from your mother. Here, plug it in. Here. I think it's a lasso. A lasso ? To catch animals. Read it. Dear Niilas, I can't wait to see you. We're going to have a great time this summer. Sunnà and Pontus look forward to meeting you too. This present is for you. You'll need it when you get here. Hugs and kisses from the north, your mom. I'm not going. Pardon ? I'm not going. I can't hear you. Why now ? I arranged it with your mother. Niilas, we've talked about this. You're going. Period. Understand ? Dry this. No, I'm not going. Niilas. Are you okay ? Do you want to join us ? Okay. I just want to stay with you. We're always together. It'll become boring. Niilas. You don't want that, do you ? Niilas. Niilas ? I really can't find him. Niilas. You've made your point. Let's go home. I understand what you're feeling. You just have to trust me. It's going to be good for you. Really. She doesn't even know me. No, but that's why you should go. What if it doesn't work ? Well... What if it does ? Hm ? Come on, let's go. We're having cold spaghetti. Did you pack everything ? Almost. Don't take that. You can't use it there anyway. Come here. You'll be back before you know it. Go to bed. I'll check on you later. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Sweden. Are you my brother ? Hello, my name is Juho. I'm happy you're finally here. This is your brother Pontus. Don't be scared, he doesn't bite. Sunnà ? Come say hello. Pontus's sister Sunnà. Your bonus sister. He doesn't look anything like Mom, does he ? I think so too. Why isn't it working ? It's confusing that the sun's still up. Welcome to the land of the midnight sun. It never gets dark here in summer. We're going straight to Daddy's. He needs help marking the reindeer calves. The idea was to go there later, but the reindeer came early this year. Yes. That's more like it. Hello, Katarina ? Gerard. Is Niilas there ? He's in the back. He can hear you. Okay. Niilas ? Hello ? Hey, mister. You alright ? Hello, Niilas ? Niilas ? Mom, give him the phone. Gerard, let me give him the phone. Okay. Niilas ? Hello ? Niilas ? Can you hear me ? Niilas ? Are you asleep already ? Hello ? Hello ? Hello ? Niilas ? Hey, mister, if you can hear me, can you give me any sign of life ? Hello ? Mister ? Hello ? Okay, let's do it that way then. One tap means yes, two taps mean no. First question. Are yu okay ? Okay, great. Second question: Are you managing with the Swedish language ? Really ? See ? I told you it would work out. Can you give the phone back to Katarina ? Hello again. Katarina, is he really okay ? Why isn't he talking ? He's just a bit overwhelmed. Need help ? No. All right. Let's go. You'll get to meet the others. Daddy, daddy, daddy. Reaidnu, this is Niilas. Niilas, Reaidnu is Sunnà and Pontus's dad. Dad, can I come with you? No, you go with mom. You know, there are thousands of them. They've spent five days gathering all the reindeer from the mountains. Look there, that's mine. See the onethere with the white ear and bent mark ? It's her calf we're marking. We start marking tonight. We'll cut all their ears and there will be lots of blood all over the place. Because we need to know which calves belong to whom. Let's go, Pontus. Come on, I'll teach you how to lasso. I'm really good at it. Leave him alone if he doesn't want to. Reindeer meat. Do you remember ? You used to love it. Suovas. Niilas ? Niilas ? Here. It's your turn. Take it. This is my brother from Belgium. It's his first time. Right ? Try it on me. Throw it, throw it, throw it. Wait. Are you running all the way to Belgium ? I don't know about you, but I want to go home. Niilas. Niilas. Niilas. Are you okay ? Are you hurt ? Pontus, stop that. We haven't done anything. Why can't we stay with Dad ? Put your seatbelt on. Dad's busy. He has to catch the reindeer that ran away. Hey. I thought you were showing Niilas his room. Guess which house is ours. I know it's strange for you, Niilas. But give it a chance, you just got here. Come. Scanning. You're up. Are they good ? All passengers on board with Juho Airlines. We're flying to Belgium. Don't you think he's cute ? You can hold him if you want. What are you doing ? What were you thinking ? Hey, mister. How are you ? Niilas, is everything okay ? Dad ? Yes ? I want to be with you. Yes, but you're over there now. Tell me. Did... Did something happen ? Hm ? Are they nice to you ? Mister ? Niilas, open the door. Talk to me. Hey ? Niilas ? Is it the yes no game again ? Shouldn't you stop with the radio silence ? Just tell me what's wrong. Mister ? You'll have to learn to fix some things yourself. Tell me what's wrong. Niilas, please say something. Playback. Mom, can I ? Sunnà, what are you doing ? Let me. I know you speak Swedish, you no longer need to pretend you can't. So stop behaving like an idiot. Mom is only trying her best. She really wants to be your mom again. Again ? Yes, again. End of file. Is it your dad ? Do you miss him ? Yes. Me too. But mine, of course. Mom ? Yes ? Niilas is stupid. But I think you're nice anyway. What ? All fixed. Pontus, Niilas food! What's wrong? Why aren't you eating anything? You love smoked reindeer. I prefer the one Mommy makes. Yummy. The Leaning Tower of Pisa. Let's make it higher. No, not that one. Use this instead. Higher, higher, higher. Higher, higher, higher. Come on, Niilas. This is going to be so cool and great. Come on. Yup. The last ones too. Sunnà ? Where is she ? No idea. She's super fast. Scanning. Can I listen ? The forest. Wait. Playback. There you are. Niilas brought the city. Do you really like this ? Wait, I wanna listen. Next. It's a tram. And this is a siren. Next. Wow, that's loud. All right. Down, and be quiet. Listen. Do you know how to climb ? Wanna try ? Yes. Come. You need both hands. I can see really far from up here. Higher, higher, higher. No, wait. Don't climb too high. Higher, higher. Yes. I knew you could do it. Sunnà, Pontus, Niilas lunch! Let's see who gets there first. Maybe you'll sleep better. The midnight sun won't bother you now. I want to go home. Pontus and Sunnà have never climbed as high as you did today. You should be proud of yourself. I want Dad to come get me. We'll see tomorrow. Sunnà, come here with it. Mister ? Dad ? Mister ? Sunnà, give it to Dad. I can hear the fish sing. Can't I keep it just a little longer ? You can keep Juho if you want. Stop it. Or I'll throw it in the water. Stop it. Stop it. You could have asked. You're like a baby who can't speak. Mommy's little baby. Just so you know, mommy is my mommy, and not yours. You're just a little baby without a mom. Never hit Pontus. No matter what he did. We don't hit each other. Understood? I'm sick of your behavior. And I'm sick of you. You think you're my mom, but you're not. Hey, Niilas ? Niilas ? We hate you. Niilas ? Niilas. Niilas. Niilas. Niilas. Niilas. Niilas, please stop. Niilas. Niilas. Mommy. Mommy. Could you hand me that spanner ? Want me to teach you ? Picture it before you throw. Make it happen inside your head first. Then you throw. Catch me. You have to believe you can do it. Come on. Catch me. Catch me. Catch me. You were close. You should practice. And remember, you have to believe you can do it before you throw it. THE ARCTIC CIRCLE Hi. Hi. Hello. Hi there. This one is for you. I'm sorry about Juho. Thank you. It's a nice one. But you may keep it. Because I have Juho. And now he can fit in my pocket, and that's very handy. And this is...Harvey. Harvey ? He fits there as well. Hi. Did you find them, Daddy? I found your calf. But not the mother. And I've looked everywhere. Pontus's reindeer is missing, the calf's mom. If we don't find its mom soon, the calf could die. Where did you find it ? By the big waterfall. But where is the calf now? Outside, in the corral. Don't be afraid, your mother will be back soon. Bye, bye, I won't be long. Recording. Sunnà ? Sunnà ? Where is the big waterfall? About half a day's trip from here. Why ? Will you come with me ? For the calf. For Pontus. You know the way. Please. Where are you going ? We're going to get your reindeer. You are ? Sjjjt! Quiet for Mom and Dad. I promise. We'll find it. No matter what. Okay, let's go. Go home... Go home. Now what ? Playback. The waterfall makes too much noise. We have to get higher. Playback. Can you hear anything ? Can you hear anything ? Scanning. Water. Birds. Bugs. I want to listen too. Maybe we should check the other side of the valley. Playback. Playback. I want to go home. Let me down. I don't want to anymore. I don't want to anymore. Come on, Pontus. Let's go. What are we actually doing, Niilas ? I don't know. I thought it would work. That what would work ? You really thought a reindeer would listen to a machine ? Doesn't it ? What do I know ? I'm not Sami. You're the reindeer experts here. But how will we find my mother reindeer then ? I was stupid enough to believe in you. Yeah, sure. Run off again. That's about the only thing you're good at. Playback. Scanning. Scanning. Playback. Scanning. Battery low. Bad signal. Battery low. Do you think he'll be coming back? I don't know... You were both really behaving very childish... Now I lost my reindeer and my brother... Do you know he's actually my brother and not yours? He's my brother as well. We both share you as our brother. You're Niilas's brother because of Mommy and my brother because of Daddy. So in a way Niilas is my brother as well. Because of you. Listen... Niilas ? That's my reindeer. Sunnà, you go over there. I'll go over there. And Pontus, you stay here. Okay. Okay ? We're gonna catch the reindeer. You have to believe you can do it. Yes. Yes. Thank you. I knew you could do it. Mommy, mommy ! We have my reindeer. Great. Hi... Hi. Can we now promise not to run away from each other ever again ? She recognizes it. Well done. Thank you. Can you imagine yourself ever coming back here ? Like on a holiday, for example. Would you like me to ? Of course I would. Hey, how did you do that ? I just did it. Mister. Well ? What if I don't want to come back after the fall holidays ? Well, I'll probably miss you. A little bit. After Christmas ? I'd miss you. Well, not really. And after Easter ? That's going too far. I'll come and get you. I'll lasso you like an elk. A reindeer. You'll catch me like a reindeer. You're the expert. You can't catch an elk. No ? I can.
