Pettijohn here today to talk to us about circumstantial evidence as it relates to the practice of criminal law ladies and gentlemen the Honorable Steven penny John I believe it was Thoreau who said some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout no but all evidence is not of such a positive nature mostly people who plan or commit crimes take every precaution not only against being caught red-handed but against leaving behind them a trout in the milk it then becomes the job of the prosecutor to link together related or unrelated objects or events called circumstantial evidence and thereby try to arrive at the identity of the criminal Kollek prison once said to me he says you know bosses are the circumstantial evidence is evidence at eight mighty on circumstantial at that well there's more than a thimbleful of truth on that remark you take for example a James Gardner murder case that occupy the front pages just a few months ago as everyone knows my office on purely circumstantial evidence got a conviction against Harry Beach for the murder of James Garden Beach was sentenced to hang in the State Penitentiary on the morning of October the 10th the day previous I was sitting in my office going over the events leading up to his conviction sooo Boardman is here to see you mr. Pettijohn ask him to come in please sue Boardman was Harry Beach's fiancee what made it worse my wife's niece she was a lovely young girl and since we had no children of our own we were especially fond of her I knew what she was coming to see me about and I hated to face it hello soon hello uncle Steve yeah well another new coat hmm you women can think of more expensive ways to get us men to look at you it's not new and Margie gave it to me last year and you know it yes I know it any news from the governor Oh uncle Steve he's just hoping against hope to expect a reprieve there's no legal basis for it but Harry's innocent I know he is I've done everything I can believe me I know Uncle Steve but Harry has no one but me you want to see him oh please all right get me warden Swann on the phone our idea you run along now I'll make the appointment let you know about it later Thank You uncle Steve when that girl left I felt like I'd been kicked under the heart by a mule uncle Steve arranged for me to see you it was very kind of uncle Steve don't be angry at him he only did what any other district attorney would have done his legal duty he's lego Judy I know you're bitter bitter I hate I hate them all the judge in that you're in your uncle Steve they all did their legal duty but each one helped drive a spike into my coffin darling let's not talk about them well what else is here to talk about it about us oh sure let's discuss plans for our wedding for a honeymoon maybe we can take a canoeing trip it'll be nice next week in the country I can track that fishing reel I bought and you can use that camera I gave it for your birthday each night when we make camp we'll have a fire going and while you're fixing the grub a lie on my back and look up at the stars and say you're a lucky man Harry beech they're not bad player are they please don't hang in me sue I'm a murderer the loss is a life for a life your uncle said it the judge sent at the newspaper said it they all said you're only torturing yourself sue what get me soon look at me you're very pretty like this uh-huh like this I was a no particular hurry to get home that evening I was experiencing what we in my business called the da's DTS only an hour ago Margie had phoned me sue had dropped by to see her after returning from the prison I knew at that meant a domestic clash between the head of the household me and the one who really runs it my wife I went into a one-minute huddle with myself and resolved to meet it with fortitude and courage to give blow-for-blow that it is much good for me is trying to revive a drowned man with a glass of water her as I opened the door there was Margie looking like a professional mourner well Marty 12 Thanks well anything you nothing much you're a little late yes yes I got tied up the last minute and then of course they had to drive slowly and save the tires hope the dinner isn't spoiled that was a challenging remark and I didn't take it up like all appeases I decided to play ostrich I went further than that I bent over backwards to be friendly I helped Margie to a chair she rang a bell Julia our stone-faced house girl came in yes ma'am go ahead with the dinner Julia yes ma'am it's sour but it's the only kind I could get this time of year well I don't know that I'd care for it anyway you're better precious little to look forward to and dried out liver I'm not hungry tonight have got a little pain had a beer for lunch I suppose huh I did not with corned beef hash I had two soft-boiled eggs a glass of milk a piece of toast the toast dinners I had one little bite that's enough with your tricky stomach and stop smoking those weeds told for pete's sake go ahead and say it say what that I'm hanging an innocent man it's written all over your face it just shrieks executioner at me guilty conscience sometimes I wish they'd hang me instead of each and get the whole thing over with the livers not too bad ma'am just a little dry and curly on the edges is all not bad tastes like the scrapings off a charcoal stove bring my coffee in here Julia yes you needn't hide it I saw it well one of it they've got a right to get married everything sewer they had only they might have had the common decency to wait a while longer and then not be so brazen about it mrs.

bet the cost you come along to Constance good evening Steve come in what's the matter come inside thank you can I get you something No thank you I'm alright now you know about Jim I've come here to confess confess what I killed him do you know what you're saying yes I do well don't you want to consult a lawyer before you talk to me maybe Ted might not I don't want Ted drawn into this I don't need any legal advice you realize that anything you say can be used as evidence against you I'm well aware of that go on you see Steve I never loved Jim maybe you knew it seemed to be common gossip I married him despite the man I really loved Ted Farnsworth it seemed clear to me at the time but I was wrong from the day of our marriage I realized what a fool I'd been there was no way to make a go of it I blew did more and more finally one day when Jim returned from a hunting trip up north hello dear I brought you something a ring-necked pheasant it should be a swell trophy for your upstairs sitting-room I'll get beats to take it over to the taxidermist in Denver it's a pretty bird isn't it very nice oh I had a great day you should come with me sometime now I'm bad to feel good Jim yes dear I have something to tell you Oh can't it wait I'm afraid not what must be important it's about us him I want a divorce a divorce oh you're joking no I'm serious well you can't be our marriage is a very equitable arrangement of course you and I for the most part do have diverse interests but that's to be expected in a new marriage we're talking about different things Jim I don't love you you're very young Constance in judgment and experience you're going through a transition now it'll all work itself out I love someone else I thought it only fair to tell you what could be fair about a dishonesty if you have any illusions that I might consent to a divorce get rid of them divorces don't occur in our family he said that as though he were quoting a commandment pride and ego had been challenged Jim had plenty of both that was three months ago I tried to believe that he was right perhaps I did lack experience and it would all work itself out but it didn't yesterday I went up to see him at our place in the mountains to tell him I was leaving him when Ted found out he insisted on driving me up Ted you're only making it more difficult coming along not war it's my problem as much as yours now forget your jitters we'll make Jim listen to reason but he's liable to be more obstinate than ever honey sees you ah I'm nonsense you need someone to back you up we are Connie dead I'm worried I'll remember darling he who hesitates gathers no moss come along he's probably out riding let's wait chummy chin up dollar good afternoon hello - what a surprise out for a drive we've come to talk to you we this matter concerns me too must be serious dare to bring your lawyer you know why we're here I know nothing except that my wife is making a perfect fool of herself this high time she stopped you've got her all wrong gardener that's why we're here to talk it over talk what over you know that constants anion do you still refuse to give me a deform I most certainly do then divorced or not I'm leaving you well you've had that choice for months but even Farnsworth will tell you that won't help your case legally why talk of this in terms of law surely you're not asking me to discuss this in terms of morals I suppose the proper thing to do would be to fight this out that wouldn't get either of us anywhere no it wouldn't not very far nothing exactly unusual about it man the woman the other man on your face of being a party to the proceedings well it's rather disconcerting what would you suggest Farnsworth I think we can iron everything out if we talk it over calmly maybe you're right won't you come in you'll see what a calm host I can be nice place you've got here gardener Thanks glad you like it make yourself at home I've never seen this before when did you bag it that's right you haven't been up here for quite some time hmm I never could get her interested in hunting now it seems I could never get her interested what's your proposal Farnsworth do you want it straight or in legal policy you're pretty good at delivering things straight I'll take it that way I'm sorry about that blow I spoke out of turn I guess I had it coming can I offer you a drink count me out I'll have one thanks okay of course you understand we want you to give Constance a divorce it's not going to be easy giving her up not only contrary to everything I believe but we have to consider what it'll mean to all of us in Hanford I realize that that's why it should be done as quietly as possible yes as quietly as possible sure you won't change your mind and have a drink no thanks come on you can't refuse now very well you were saying Farnsworth I was saying this whole thing should be arranged without scandal no no scandal I I'd better make sure of that I'm all through playing host now get out I should have known come on Ted let's go oh no he goes at you stay please Ted you'd better do as he says I'll send a car for you when I get to town can you guess the town my advice would be to keep going well here's to us you really ought to join me my dear oh the shame to waste this it's really very good you're drinking too much I never couldn't ring very much good eye huh I said huh that requires an answer dear you're being very stupid Oh stupid not like Farnsworth he's different Oh for heaven sakes chip you're drunk go sleep it off no now that you're here it'll be easier for all concerned I'm gonna give you what you want your freedom leave that gun alone he was dead I was terrified I didn't know what to do I ran down the road and Harry beech came along and drove me back to town that's all there is Steve there I was with a confession on my hands and the murderer all murderous in jail this even before an autopsy had been performed well I telephone Thomas my assistant and gave the news to the reporters then I thought I'd go home we get some sleep that's what I thought sure I'll go hello Ted I just heard over the radio that Connie's confessed yes she has where is she downtown you've got to let her go no don't get excited come on in we'll talk it over hello Ted Margie you could use something to quiet your nerves how about a cup of tea now look Steve Connie's lying she didn't kill Jim I did yeah I know you and Margie and I we all did sit down but I'm serious now it's very gallant of you to order front further Constance what it's the other way around she's fronting for me I was with her early in the evening when she heard that Jim was killed the way she looked at me I I knew she suspected me that's why she came here and confessed well if Constance is innocent of night in jail won't do her any harm but there's no reason for you to go off the deep end there's every reason I killed Jim Oh have a cup of tea and stop sacrificing yourself all over the place I don't want any tea I tell you I killed a man and you don't believe me Constance told me the whole story you took a poke at Jim he invited you into the lodge pulled a gun on you and ordered you off the property yes he did but what Connie didn't tell you though she suspected was that I went back again with the gun I suppose no I don't own a gun I went back to get Connie but when I got there she was gone and the lodge was locked Oh Oh put the gun away Gardner I just want to talk to you for a minute I have nothing to say to you Fonzworth but you're hurt you need help keep away from me I don't care what Connie told you Steve that's exactly how it happened yeah well that's not a bad story no sorry's good at this hour well aren't you going to book me oh stop it let's have some tea then I'll give myself up to the police don't be an idiot then book me you're crazy man if you don't the police will all right if that's what you want that's exactly what I want here take this it'll amuse you it's a better story than yours hello this is Thomas chief sorry to wake you fine Swiss here and before I booked him I thought you'd want to know that God nur wasn't killed by a bullet from his own gun what but Maher checked it it wasn't from godless gun so it must have been fired from another revolver another revolver that's right you all right your whole Farnsworth bring mrs. garden to my office tell them nothing I'll be down there right away Oh what do you think of that I'll wait for the $64 question good night chief you'd say this doesn't match Martin no sir then that seems to blow both the confession sky-high sure does bring them in all right font with mrs. garner tweeting Constance I have news for you Ted is confessed to the murder he didn't yes and while I'll admit I didn't believe him his story fits the coroner's report perfectly why did you do it I want to compliment you on your acting performance Carson's you had even me believing it but as for you Ted I always thought you were a downright liar and I still do you see that gardeners gun went off while you were struggling with him that's right Steve well then how does it happen at the bullet that the coroner found in Gardner's head was fired from another revolver what's that oh you didn't kill him any more than I did you're just fronting for each other now I don't like that you gave the real murderer eight more hours to cover up his tracks you spoiled my sleep and you've just balled up everything now go on get out of here both of you what a night what tonight a murder two confessions two exonerations and the murderer is still at large yes may I ask the question at this point sir surely what is it was any part of their confessions true oh yes yes they driven up to the lodge all right and Gardner and Farnsworth it had an argument and Gardner had ordered him off the place but that's all did this fella hairy Beach Drive mrs. Gardner back yes but you're getting ahead of my story young fella you remember my wife's knees saying that beach had gone up to get gardener to sign some papers and hadn't come back that day well he didn't come back that day or the next or the next file my wife and her niece grew more alarmed I grew more suspicious after a few days I asked the governor to institute a statewide search for beach onee-sama there's open up open the door we'll break it open what's it enjoy these dogs weren't even for nothing all right close the doors no tomorrow they won't bother you none come on out are you hairy Beach yeah you're under arrest for the murder of James Gardner but I didn't kill him come on I didn't kill him I tell you I didn't tell him mr. Pettijohn that's the truth and you've got to believe me now quiet down Beach and let's have the story from the beginning you say you went up to the lodge around noon yes sir then what happened as I got close to the lodge I saw mrs. Gardner coming down the road she seemed excited and upset she waved for me to stop and I did hello Harry hello you got me back to Henson well sure but do you mind if I tell mr. Gardner first he's expecting me it's alright I've already told him hurry please okay I drove her back to town I knew something was wrong by the way she acted but she didn't say anything and it wasn't my business to ask her then what did you do well I went back to the lodge the door was open but mr. Gardner wasn't there I found him near the creek he'd had a couple 2 million when he drinks he gets ugly well speak up what took you so long I'm sorry mr. Gordon I thought you knew you knew what well then I was taking mrs. Gardner back to town so that's how she got away that's the truth mr. Pettijohn I swear it why did you run away I started back to town to tell you but the more I thought of the screwy way that Gordon was killed the more I was afraid you wouldn't believe me I know my running away doesn't look good but oh just good boy you're in a jam right up your neck so I was right you don't believe me well how can you expect me to there are too many things unexplained I've told you everything I know you say that when you got back to the lodge the door was open but Gardner wasn't there that's right that you found a number the creek yes sir what was he doing there maybe he was looking for mrs. Gardner I don't know you saw a man running away what did he look like I don't know oh you don't know but you heard a second shot fired do you expect me to believe that he fired it well he must have you heard a car leave heard it but didn't see it that's right that's fantastic and you can't describe either the car or the man no sir wasn't that other man you no of course not then where did you run away why I told you why do you expect people to believe that an innocent man runs away do you expect me to believe that an innocent man cashes phony checks all over the state that was the only way I could get gas and food that's the only way you'll Manor has to hide gets gas and food I tell you I didn't kill him no you son you haven't got a chance if your story doesn't convict your circumstantial evidence will that and your record records yes I just heard you spent a year in Johnstown prison before you came to Hanford you take my advice boy and you come clean if you'll plead guilty I might be able to do something for you I could make a recommendation of leniency to the court for Sue's sake last time I took friendly advice i landed in jail this time I stick to my story yes but not the true story this is nothing but a pack of badly contrived lies no listen Harry I want to help you but if you don't tell me the truth by hangs a tire don't you see that and believe me if you don't tell the true facts I'll be compelled to ask for the maximum penalty nothing I could say would persuade him to change his story and I had to convict him of murder in the first degree it is therefore your pardon Duty humbly to confess in bewail you're great in manifold offenses and to repent you truly of your sin as you tend to the eternal salvation of your soul be not deceived with a vain and presumptuous expectation of God's favor nor say within yourself peace peace where there is no peace for there is no peace saith my god to the wicked came the day of the hanging a bad day for a district attorney always no man should think himself infallible mistakes can be made by everyone and I'm no exception I was in my office hoping that someone might at the last minute uncover some overlooked clue a piece of evidence upon which I could ask for a stay of execution I looked at the clock it was 11 only an hour remain before the trap would be sprung call the governor and get a reprieve for Harry beech you call it all right Margy for the love of st. Peter you'll never see st. Peter not if you're hanging Airy governor Jameson on the phone are you mad for the District Attorney it's urgent what do you want me to do I can't just ask him you asked and like it hairy beaches I've told you a million times I'm not the only one who thinks he's guilty the jewelry the judge the governor they all think he's guilty and nobody will ever see st.
