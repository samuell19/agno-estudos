Yeah, she's not going anywhere, man. - Sweet, that. - Yeah. Wait up. - Fucking Terry. - Spaz. - Gaz. - Mate. What did you do that for? Look, we said there was going to be no... Shut up, Terry. Open fucking sesame. After you, mate. Yeah. Hmm, very nice. So where is it? Terry, where's the safe? - I don't know. - What? Alright, sweet tooth. So we're in the park, and big man Terry tells us a story. Tells us there's a nice big, old house and the nice old owners are going to be out, right? - Right. - Tells us there's a safe with a nice, fat stash of cash just sitting in it, and now he tells us he don't know where the fuck it is? Well, it could be in... in the bedroom or... or the doctor's room. Oh, yeah, or the fucking broom cupboard. What's all this, your mom's? Should tell her a good skivvy takes better care of her kid. That's it, Mrs. Mop. He needs to show some respect. We can't just wreck... We said that we wouldn't... Terry, it is what they pay you monthly, no? Well, look at it. It's... - What's happened to your ear? - What? Other ear, Terry, the gay one. Oh, fuck. I must have lost it. Oi. For fuck's sake, mate. What the... Shit. I really fucking hated this place. Oi. She's let herself go, eh? Yeah, well, I'd like to see you deal with being ill. Terry, get your ass in here, mate. Ah. What? What's down there? I don't know. What? Should we have a look? - A bit of exercise. - I-I can't. My ankle is... Alright, it's not going to fucking fall off. Relax. What's he doing up there? I don't know. But it doesn't matter. It's not your fucking house, Terry. Do whatever you like. Move on. Get down there. Why do I always get the shit jobs? Here goes the neighborhood. Nathan. Nathan, I found it. Come on, what are you doing? Oh, can you imagine how much they've got stashed? It's there! Oh, you are going to be able to buy your own kebab van, mate. The Huggins are fucking loaded. - Can you imagine? - Okeydokey. What the fuck? What? You said it was an electronic code. Yeah. Uh, yeah, uh, that's what my mom said. - So? - Really? Did she tell you what the fuck I'm supposed to do with this? What do you mean? It's a dial lock. Can you crack a combination? Of course not. That makes two of us. - You can't open it? - Oh, yeah. - Top marks, fat boy. - It can't be that hard. It's... It's probably just a birthday, something like that. Piece of shit. It weren't a Christmas present. That guy that lent it to me ain't Santa Claus. He don't fuck around when it comes to debts, mate. I should have known any plan I had with you in it was fucked from the start. It was your idea to come here, you and him. - I never wanted... - Move. Fuck! What? This is bullshit, Nathan. I want to go now. Hold on. You're the boss. What's the plan, boss? Look, we've already been here too long. We should go. Anyways, Mary's... Don't even think about telling me what to do with my mis... Oh, hey, hey, hey. Let's keep it civil, ladies. Mate, you want the tosh, right? - Yeah. - Really want it? Of course I fucking want it. And these two withered old cunts are the ones with the magic code, right? Why don't we screw it out of them? Yeah, we wait till they get back. We scare the shit out of them. They give us what we want. Right. They'll piss the fucking code out. Nice one, mate. Plenty of time for the little lady later, right? Hello? Nathan? Hello? Wanker. Look, they're going to be back any minute. Piece of shit. The TV doesn't work. It's for video. What the fuck is this? - Oh, bingo. - Rich cunts. Yeah, disgusting, ain't it? Fucking fake. I'm not joking, mate. How I've spent my whole life with fuck all. Watched my dad rot away with fuck all, never anything to give my mom. I know you're not joking there, mate. I know. It's what we're doing. It's why we're here. We're taking it back. It's yours, mate, all yours. Yeah. Fuck it, yeah. Now, don't just stand there, Benson. Get us something to eat. Quality snacks, yeah? Chip sticks, salami, nuts. Cunt. Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Might need to sort that, mate. She's getting a bit mouthy. She's just worried about her job. I could drive her and then bring the car back. Drive her? He wants to have a go, eh? Hey, you dirty pig. You want to get stuck right in, pump some of that lard out? She is going absolutely nowhere. We all stay right here till this is finished. Too fucking right, mate. She's not just going to let us... - Let us? - Nathan! Terry, she'll do whatever the fuck I want. Nathan! Nathan! She's not her sister. Nathan! Nathan! Babe! Can we please go now? Oh, come in. You've got to see this. I have to be at work, Nathan. Won't take long. Stop messing with me. Five minutes, then we're out of here, but you've got to see this. You'll love it. I promise. - Come over. - Five minutes. Come over. Come on. What are you waiting for, babe? Come on in. Well, what am I looking at? Come here, babe. Nathan, stop. It's not fucking half bad, is it? Nathan, stop. Yeah. You won't be needing that shit for much longer. We're almost there, babe. Nathan. Stop it. Terry's watching. Let him. Come on, perv, work to do. These lovebirds have got some sorting out to do. Have fun, sweethearts. Fuck's sake. Oh, yeah. This the mop? Forget that slag downstairs. This one is more your style. You'd make a lovely couple. That's Kate. She was the Huggins' daughter. She died a long time ago. Mop. Definitely here. No, fuck off, Nathan. What's wrong? Is this 'cause of last night? Hmm? I'm pregnant. Pregnant. Know what that means? No worries, babe. We're going to be fucking loaded. Plenty to go around, right? No. Yeah. Yeah, I just need to finish this. That's right. Shit. What the fuck are you doing? No worries, babe. Alright? I've got everything under control. - Wait. - Shut up, retard. Right. Put these on. No way. Yes way, darling. Come on. Hey, come on. Put it on. Put the stocking on, Mary. No names. Richard. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Easy, easy. Alright. Ellen, Ellen, Ellen! Give me your hands or I'll break your arms. Move. Just move. Sit down. I'm right here, darling. - Give me your hands. - Please. - Give me your hands. - She's injured. Please. Please. Take everything you want, but you can't leave her like this. I mean, look at her. She's... She's injured. You'll find everything out there. Quickly. Granddad takes charge, eh? Exactly, you don't get to ask for fuck all. - Alright? - I'll sort it out. - What? - Yes, you'll find disinfectant and the bandages are in the cupboard at the back... Hey, she's not a fucking retard. Alright? Shut it. Fucking who do you think you are? What... Ah. Here you go. Drink this. That's it. Thank you. Now, please make sure there are no splinters in the cut. That's it. Hold still. Good. Now some disinfectant on the cut. - This will sting. - Sting? Yes, darling. Like a bee? Yes, a bit like a bee. Oh, I like bees. We keep them in the garden. That's it. Can you hurry up? We're not spending the fucking night. Now tie her up. Come on. Sorry. Alright. Fine. Done. Okay, so now we've taken care of her. Give us what we came for. There are £300 and a credit card in my wallet. Alright. What else? In the kitchen there's £1,000 or so in a biscuit tin - on top of the fridge. - Alright. Go and get the money and put it in a bag. What's the fucking PIN number? 6193. 6193. Alright. 93. Very good. Hey. It was locked. Alright? We can get Gaz's mate... No fucking names, asshole. - Sorry, it's just... - You've got it. Right, let's go. - Is that it? - Less than 2 grand You're having a laugh. You taking a piss, you horrible old fucker? Mate, I said, "Is that it?" This is all you've got? A doctor, nice big house like this? I think someone is telling porkies. What about the safe? Huh? What about the fucking safe, eh? I don't know what you're talking about. He's talking about the safe, you cunt. We don't have a safe. Are you sure? Of course I'm sure. There is no safe. Really? So what about that nice, big shiny metal door down in your basement? What's that, then? Fucking doll's house? What are you talking about? More fucking money. A lot more. Fuck's sake. You'll regret this. Shut up, you old cunt. I'm going to get out of here, Nathan. - This is fucked. - I know. Listen, there is a ton of cash in that safe. Okay? You can forget about working at the home. Life is going to be changing. Are you listening to me? I'm doing this for you, me, the baby. This is bullshit, okay? It's totally fucked. Shit, better than "EastEnders," this. Let's do this. Yeah, business first, yeah? Sort domestics later. Give me the combination. Richard, no. This won't get you anywhere but prison. Go home before things really get out of hand, and we'll forget all about it. Give me the fucking combination now. I can't. Who the fuck do you think you're dealing with, here? Eh? From what I can see, an ill-mannered lout on the verge of making a catastrophic error. I think somebody didn't get enough spankings when he was little. I'm tempted to agree, darling. - Ah! - Oh! Don't hurt Richard, my Richard. Shh, darling. Shh, do-do-do-don't upset yourself. Everything will be fine. Don't worry, Mrs. Robinson. We're not animals. No one is going to hurt your precious hubby. Your darling Richard is safe with us. To be honest, it's you I'm more worried about. My wife doesn't know the combination. Of course she doesn't, Richard. Of course she doesn't. But I'm asking you. Leave her alone. Don't hurt her. Nathan, fucking stop him. Hey. The fuck are you doing? You can't just... Alright, mate. You're the boss. There we go, mate. What the fuck am I supposed to do with that? You want him to give us the combination, right? This is fucking bullshit. Where are you going? Hey, hey, come back. Nice one, mate. Don't worry, mate. Daddy's on it. Mary. You hiding from Gaz? Mary, Mary. Mary, Mary. Mary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary. Ahh. A-ha. Where are you, darling? You hiding from Gaz? Emergency services? Help. Got you! Leave me alone! What the fuck? Nathan, help me! Don't let him manipulate you. It's not too late. You're young. Don't destroy your futures for the sake of some thug. Listen. He's an animal. What's he doing to her? I think he's doing bad things. Yes, dear, very bad things. Hey, shut up. Alright? Just shut up. How did you get mixed up in something like this, Terry? It's not like you, all this violence. Your poor mom, she'll be so upset, so disappointed. Terry? You two were always inseparable. I can't believe that's changed. It hasn't changed, has it, Nathan? Nathan? Lover boy not up to keeping you in line, eh? You worried about your Nathan getting mixed up - in all this shit? - Fuck off. He's a big boy, princess. He don't need no one to make his decision for him. Especially not some fucking psycho. What, you going to trap him with a kid and a quick tumble every Saturday night? He's so over you, darling, it ain't even funny. We're going to crack that safe wide-open, nick all their money, then Nathan is going to leave you and your shit little brat to your shit little life in this shit fucking shithole. - Nathan! - No! Let's keep it down, eh? I watched you grow up. I knew your families. I know what hardships you've been through. Things haven't been easy, but you're good lads, strong lads, and you hung in there. I know what made you. I know what you're made of, what you are. You're not responsible for this. I can see that clear as day. It's the other one, that beast up there. He's not from here, is he? A stranger. Don't let him ruin everything, your friendship, your life. You're worth so much more. Trust me. Hey. Shut up. You're only saying this because you want to keep all of your fucking money, don't you? He's right, Nathan. We should just stop it. Afterwards, it'll be too late. It just doesn't feel right! Shut your mouth, or I will cut your fucking tongue out. We stick to the plan. What were you doing up there? Little miss bitch here was making a call, couldn't wait to fuck you over. - It can't be, Richard. - Shh. Shifting up a gear, eh? About fucking time, people! - Right. - Nathan, don't do this. No more fucking about. The code. Hey. What? Give me the code, or I cut her finger off. - The code. - Don't! Nathan! Shut it, window licker. The man's working. Give me the fucking code, Richard! Don't do it. Think of Mary, the baby. What the fuck? Don't worry about my little friend, mate. You just show these cunts here what you're made of. Last chance. Give it a little twist when you hit the bone. Whip it off of the knuckle, nice and clean. Do it. Alright. If it's so easy, yeah, you fucking do it! Good, Nathan. What the fuck? Oh. You're mates now, you and the doctor and his good lady wife? - Don't. - You've got responsibilities. - Stop it! - You fucking lollipop. Who knew you were such a delicate little bunny? What's wrong with him, Doc? Him and special needs and that silly slag over there? Something in the water around here? Couldn't do nothing for him. Should have been put down at birth. Pitiful. Cut it off. No. Do it. Please. Cut her fucking finger off, wanker! Give me the code, please. Fuck. What you go and do that for? Nathan! Nathan. Ah! Ah, you silly cunt! Fuck! Nathan! We could have had a lot of fun. Nathan! Oh, my God! He's going to bleed to death! We need to get him upstairs! Untie me. Yeah. I'd like to untie you, Doc. I'd like you to save lover boy on the floor over there. I'd like to walk out of here leaving you and the missus tucked up tight in bed ready for whatever it is a pair of old skates like you get up to. No harm done, everything forgiven. Believe me, I'd love that, really, oi, drive out of this shithole back to my penthouse in the big city, get my cock sucked right through my asshole before beddy-byes, put me feet up, get me head down, forget all about it over a nice cup of tea and a bed full of £50s. Fucking mint, that'd be. Get my vote. But that ain't up to me. Oh, for fuck's sake, untie him! Okay! Here's how we're going to play it. You ready? You give me the magic numbers, I'll let you be doctors. Richard! Oh, give him the fucking numbers. She's right, you know. Give me the fucking numbers. You can't! Clock's ticking, mate. - Alright. - Richard, no. Everything is going to be fine, my darling. The numbers are 17, 1, 19, 22. There we go! How hard was it? Amazing what some greedy bastards will do to keep their paws on a few quid. 17... ...1... ...19, 22. Yes. Um, it's 21, yes, not 22. 21? Yes. 21. 17, 1, 19, 21. 17, 1, 19, 21? You sure? Don't want to change your mind, confer with the missus? No. I'm sure. It was the year that my Ellen was born. Okay. 17... ...1... ...19... 21. Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear. Wait a minute. What... What are you doing? No. No, please. Please, please, don't tie her. I beg you. Don't tie her. - Too late, darling. - Ellen, don't worry. Just don't... don't worry. No, please! No, please! I beg of you. Ellen, don't worry. No, you can't! Please! Oh, no, please! Please, don't! No! Ellen! No! No, not my Ellen! No! No! Fuck's sake! Who did your electrics, granddad? Fucking criminal. No. No. No! - Now... - No! ...where were we? - No! - No! Mary, cut me loose, please. Oh. You did the right thing, Mary. You did what you had to do. We have to get him to the hospital. Terry, help me. Terry, help me! Come on! Oh, no. No one's leaving. The hospital is 30 miles away. You know that. I seriously doubt he could survive the journey. I'll treat him while we wait for help. But look at him. Trust me. I'll take good care of him. Don't worry. Terry, I need you to help Mary take Nathan upstairs. Can you manage that? Thank you, Terry. Come on, darling. Don't worry. We'll clean that up later. One second. That's it. Nearly there. Okay, lie back. - Watch it there. - Get his legs. Get his legs. It's okay. It's okay. - No stitches. - I'm sorry. No, darling, not this time. Don't speak. Don't speak. Treats, Richard? Of course. Treats for my brave girl. Dr. Huggins, please! Until every sin is reckoned. You got what you deserve! - I hope you rot! - Ellen! Come, come, dear. Please forgive my wife. She's not entirely herself anymore, and don't worry. I fully intend to keep my promise. Thank you, Dr. Huggins. Really, what did you expect me to do, Terry, Mary? It's alright. He's just getting his things. It's alright. Right-o. No! No! Just breathe. - You're hurting him! - Be quiet! It's okay. He's just taking it out. Compression. Oh! Oh, Jesus. Oh, God! It's okay. It's okay. The blade snapped off inside. Just look at me. Look at... You're hurting him! It's going to be okay. Compression. He's a lucky young man. The blade has missed his vital organs. Yes. A little work, he'll make it. You hear that? You're going to be okay. It's going to be okay. Now, I want you all to wait outside because I need space to work. - Don't... Don't leave me. - No, no. - It's okay. - Don't leave me. I'm not going anywhere. - I'm staying. - I must insist. I need peace and quiet if I'm going to look after him properly. We should go, yeah? Let Dr. Huggins do his work, yeah? You're going to be okay. - Don't do it. - Shh. Come on, Mary. These are for Ellen, and, please, watch over Mrs. Huggins while I take care of Nathan. Come on, Mrs. Huggins. - Come on. - Now don't worry. I'll patch him up, call the ambulance. Go away, then. Shoo, shoo. Careful. Watch the glass. Can I get you anything, Mrs. Huggins? Mary, it's okay. I'm here. He risked his wife's life for a fucking security code. It's going to be okay. We just got to be strong, yeah? Come here. It's alright. Yeah, Mary? Shh. Please don't cry. Shh. It's going to be alright. You know Dr. Huggins. It's going to be okay, yeah? You're beautiful, yeah? What the fuck are you doing? Well, we're safe now. Safe? What the fuck are you talking about? What do you think just happened in the basement? Nathan is dying! How could you drag him into this shit? It wasn't me. It was... It was Nathan! And who gave him the idea? Whose fucking mom works here? You've always followed Nathan around like a lost dog, but you could never touch him. You're pathetic. We should go. I'm supposed to be looking after Dr. Huggins... You'd have just let him die if I hadn't done what I did. Don't say that! It's the truth. It's what you do, Terry. You fuck up, and everything around you turns to shit! Why else do you think Jane left? She didn't! She didn't leave. Jane left because you're a fucking nothing. You're a joke! She never loved you! She pitied you, and then she despised you, and you drove her away! You're a fucking retard who drove my sister away. We all lost her because of you. That's mine! Dirty. Mrs. Huggins, I'll do that. Oh! Poor Terry. Come and sit down. Let me take care of you. Yeah. Dr. Huggins! Yes? I want to see Nathan. The wound was much more serious than I thought. He should pull through, but it will take some... I just gave him something. The pain was... He's sleeping like a baby now. He's going to need a lot of rest. Are you sure he's... If you just stand back... Right. There. Normal. I assure you, there's nothing to worry about. Then why couldn't I feel anything? Why is he so cold? Where's the fucking ambulance? Oh, it shouldn't be long now, I expect, but I'm happy to call them if this puts your mind at rest. You stay with him. Hello! Richard Huggins. Yes, yes. I called for an ambulance a few minutes ago. Yes. Can you tell me how long it will be? Right you are. Thank you so very much. It's on its way. Shouldn't be long now. Oh, goodness. You don't look at all well. Quite normal to feel this way after what you've been through and in your condition. - I'm okay. - Oh, no, you're not, my dear. You're not okay, but never fear. I've just the thing somewhere. Got you. These should buck you up. Two of these should do the trick. Trust me, my dear. I've dealt with many cases just like yours... shock, anxiety, PTSD. These chaps are most effective. There. That didn't hurt, did it? I told you so. You're a big brave boy. Your shoes. Soon, you won't feel anything nasty at all. I've had just about enough of this, Kate, dragging goodness knows what into our house. I've told you a thousand times, shoes off at the door! Ellen! Come, my dear. This isn't Kate. This is Mary, one of our young guests. You remember Mary, Mary and Jane Voller, the twins from the village. Mary? Mary Voller, how she's grown! What did you give him? Oh, a perfectly standard analgesic. Ellen was my nurse for many years, a very efficient nurse, and a most lovely one, too, I might add. Come, my dear. Let's make our guests a nice cup of tea. Oh, haven't we forgotten something? Behind you. Warmer. Warmer. Hot. Red-hot. On the left. Oh! The needles. I have to put the needles away. Good girl. And why do we have to put the needles away? Because needles are sharp, and someone could get hurt. Someone could get hurt. Bravo, darling. We can't let the bloody disease win. I constantly jog her memory, give her little challenges, little goals, make a game of life. It's vital. Whatever it takes to keep my Ellen with me. ♪ Sweeping with this great big broom ♪ ♪ Sweeping till it's nice and clean ♪ ♪ You would never know it's me ♪ ♪ Washing, washing, washing up ♪ We have to get out. Give me your phone. What? Your phone, quick. Use your own phone. I-I haven't got it. Terry! - What? - The fucking phone! We have to call for help! Are we alright, Terry? Lovely, Dr. Huggins! Look, I told you, I haven't got it. Yeah? Hey! What? Where is it? I gave it to Mrs. Huggins. You can't expect her to trust us. And you trust them? We need to get out of here now! Nathan's d... Tea time! There we are. Thanks, Dr. Huggins. There's a good boy. I'll sit over here. Lead the way. Terry? Tea for Mary. There. How is that ankle doing, Terry? M-Much better. Thanks, Dr. Huggins. The injection really helped. I can hardly feel a thing. Glad to hear it. It's a pity you refused my help. You'd be feeling much better, too. Don't you think she looks a bit peaky? Not well at all. No. No, no. Filthy! I'll smoke it outside. I'm sorry, but I'm sure you understand I can't allow that. Please sit here. Drink your tea and wait for the ambulance to arrive. Besides, you must think about your unborn child. Smoking can cause any number of problems, appalling birth defects, carcinomas, teratomas, babies born with their brains on the outside of their skulls. I'd like to commend you once again for your courage, my dear. What you did wasn't easy, taking a human life, and we survived thanks to you. Oh. Oh, we really must fumigate this place again soon. We're plagued by vermin... moths, silverfish, cockroaches, every sort of pest. Sit down, Mary. Drink your tea. Under the circumstances, it's hardly polite to refuse. Come on. Mary! When Kate was born the way she was, it took everything we had not to believe that she was, in some way, a punishment from God. Yes, we loved her and tended her, and she grew up into a wonderful girl, beautiful, sensitive, a wonderful girl. We tried to protect her and educate her and make sure she minded her manners and did what was right. There were times when she resisted, and sometimes she turned on us, but we stood firm and never faltered. Ellen and I never once resented the task, never once despaired. Come, come, darling. I... I am... I'm such a scatterbrain. Such a silly, ditzy thing. Ah, you're my silly, ditzy thing. Of course. The biscuit is for Mary. Here you go, Mrs. Huggins. The scrapbook was Ellen's idea. She keeps it going, and it's good for her memory. Such detail, all Ellen's work. Her very own tribute to all those lost little souls. Isn't it extraordinary? Oh. Such a terrible loss. Of course, you both understand. Ellen, love. It's hot. You have to let tea stand when it's too hot. Yeah. Could I have my phone back? I need to call Nathan's mother. I'm sorry, my dear. I don't understand. Nathan had my phone. It's not in his pocket. I know you have it. If it wasn't for Nathan, you'd both be dead! You lied about the ambulance. You never called. The phone is broken. What did you do to him? Tell me what the fuck is going on! Come now, pull yourself together, Mary. You're upset. That's perfectly understandable, but letting your emotions get the better of you won't help anyone. Drink your tea like a good girl! Ah! Open the door! Mary, come, you're exhausted, probably in shock. - Open the door! - Your hormones are raging. You can't see the wood for the trees. Come now, let's not be silly. This is not helping anyone. Open the fucking door! Ah, ah! I don't like to cause you pain, but you give me no choice! Someone like that wants to become a mother. This behavior is simply unacceptable! Children need a proper mommy and daddy, not a nasty tramp like this one! - Ah! - She will soon calm down. The cupboard always works. Ah, let me out! Let me out! What the fuck?! I don't know what's wrong with her. - I've never seen her like this. - Open the fucking door! You should be very careful, Terry. A girl like that... Terry, don't listen to them! - ...she's a liar... - Terry! ...a nasty, dirty parasite, poison! What the fuck is wrong with you? You deserve so much better. Now, dear, this has all been a bit too much for you. - Let me out! - Terry will watch her. Won't you, Terry, until the ambulance arrives? - Terry? - Yes, dear. I'll be down as soon as Ellen is in bed. Terry, Terry, please! You can trust me, Mrs. Huggins. Terry, let me out, please! Terry, don't listen to them, please! Let me out! Terry, let me out! You're not well. Dr. Huggins is right, it's your hormones or whatever he said. Oh, just get over it and let me out! Don't speak to me like that! You never speak to Nathan like that. He treats you like shit. I don't even understand why you're with him. He just uses you, and he slags you off. He doesn't love you. He's never loved you. He's dead. Darling, no, please, stay calm, please, stay calm. She needs to be punished. Of course, darling. I'll take care of it. No, no. I want to take care of it. Shh, you're retired. No, she needs to be punished now. Shh. She's been so bad. She'll ruin everything. Now I want us to punish her now. Are you sure, darling? Yes, yes, yes! Very well, if that's what you want. 10 minutes ago, he said it was going to be okay. Dr. Huggins killed him! We've known the Huggins our whole lives. - They never... - Open this fucking door! What is wrong with you? Hurry up! - Shit. - What is it? She must have given me a bit too much of the... Terry, what the fuck are you... The injection, Mrs. Huggins must have given... My leg has gone numb! Don't you understand? Terry, get it open! What the fuck are you doing? Terry! Terry! D-Dr. Huggins? What the fuck are you doing? Stop. D-Dr. Huggins? Terry, shut up, you dumb fuck! Dr. Huggins? Don't you fucking get it? Shut up! Shut the fuck up, speaking to me like that! I'm not shit! Shit! I'm not shit. I'm sorry. Listen, we can still get out of this, but we've got to be together. What do you mean, "Together"? - I can't do it on my own. - No, no, no, no, what... w-w-what do you mean by, "Together"? Listen, Terry, now is not really the time. It is! It is the time. Answer me, please. What do you mean by, "Together"? I don't know what... You mean... You mean like before, how we were before? What? Before, when we loved each other. But... But you were with... You. Only you came, just you. What are you talking about? I'm talking about us, house that we were going to get, remember? Stop it. Please, don't. It's... We were good together. You know it. You're scaring me. Everybody said so. Don't do this. Don't leave me here. Leave you? Hold on, why would I leave you? Jane, where are you going? Jane! Jane, where are you going? We... We have to get the keys. Wait here. Jane! He's just fucking asleep. He's asleep, she said. She's a fucking liar. Where is she? Jane? She never liked me. Jane. What are you doing? I was going to go and get you. You were leaving me. No, no, no. I could have, but I didn't, but we have to hurry. We have to go quickly because they could be anywhere. Don't lie. You were leaving me. No, no, I-I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that. Now we can go together. - Okay? - Huh? Get out of here together. Terry, Terry, Terry, get off! Fuck! Where the fuck are you? Fuck! Come on! Fucking... Come on, come on. - Terry! - Ah! Terry, get up. - Jane? - Get up, get up. We have to save the Huggins. What the fuck are you talking about? Cover your mouth. Mary! Ah! Mary! Where are you? Terry! Ah! Help! Terry! What was that, you old bitch? What was that? What did you just give me? What was in the fucking syringe? Ah! This is no way to behave, young lady! Yeah! Put this on, my darling. Just fine, darling, I'm right here. She's about one minute away from getting her fucking throat slit! Give me the keys, now! Don't hurt her. I'm not joking! I'll kill her! Alright, alright! I'll... I'll... I'll give you the keys. Just give me a moment. I just need to find them. What did she give me? A relaxant. The effect is rapid but temporary. It'll wear off after a few hours. Give me the keys! The drug will paralyze your limbs one after the other, one arm, then the other, one leg, then the other. I should think you have about 30 minutes' mobility left... - Give me the keys, now! - ...more or less. - I'm going to give you the keys! - Now! Of course. Alright. Right now, yes, but... but... but your friend! Don't you want Terry? Of course I want Terry! I want Terry and the keys! Very good. Listen, Terry, if you help me, I can take you... - What are you doing? - I just need to think! About what? Now, or I gut her! I know where she is. Terry, all you have to do is just... - Richard. - Don't worry, darling. Everything's fine. No, darling, everything's fucked! Bring Terry over to the door with the keys! Of course, and in exchange? No, I'm not fucking negotiating! You get her back when I've got Terry and the keys! You must give me your assurance that... that she won't be hurt, or we don't have a deal! Okay, then she'll talk. She'll talk to you all the time. Do you hear me? Ellen, darling? Fucking say something! - Darling, are you hurt? - Oh, she's... she's losing it! - Darling? - Say something! ♪ Ring-a-ring-a-roses ♪ The children's favorite, Ellen. ♪ Ring-a-ring-a-roses ♪ ♪ A pocket full of posies ♪ ♪ A tissue, a tissue, we all fall down ♪ ♪ Ring-a-ring-a-roses ♪ ♪ A pocket full of posies ♪ ♪ A tissue, a tissue, we all fall down ♪ ♪ Mummy's in the teapot ♪ ♪ Daddy's in the cup ♪ ♪ Baby's in the saucer ♪ ♪ We all jump up ♪ Come on, keep singing! ♪ Ring-a-ring-a-roses ♪ ♪ A pocket... ♪ ♪ Ring, ring ♪ Keep fucking singing!

You're safe. You're safe now. Hey. Fucking freaks. Oh. Oh, that's doesn't look good, Mary. Not good at all. Young Terry is no mean marksman, it seems. Shouldn't be long now. And there's also the chance that the effects of the drugs with which my Ellen injected you, one of my racier little concoctions, won't help with the pain. It's almost a pity. We even considered whether or not you could somehow stay as an occasional stand-in. Yes. She's grown a bit worn, rather damaged. We thought about it, Ellen and I. We really did. And your spirit certainly made an impression on us both. That business with the hammer. Yes, we discussed it, but in the end, we decided best stick with what you know. Just a few minutes more, and then a lovely long sleep. Goodbye, Mary. I knew we could trust you. Terry has been a very good boy, and good children get their just desserts. Our lovely special star, so very bright, but too fragile for this world. Ah! Look. After she was taken, Ellen was inconsolable. She needed another another child to fill the void. We tried a number, quite a number of girls, but none of them were quite right enough. Not right at all. And then one lovely summer's evening, on a station platform... Here we are, Terry, as I promised. My beautiful darling Kate. We brought someone to see you. It's a surprise. We'll take good care of you. And we'll be a family. When, darling? In the spring. Lovely idea. Farming, Mrs. Huggins, at this time of year? A bit late, isn't it? Oh, no. Three new bushes. They make such delicious jam. The children love it so. Have you finished? Yes, Mrs. Huggins. What happened to the door? Another infestation, yes. I've had to spray everything. Bloody silverfish. Is... Is everything alright? You... You seem a-a-a little, um... Preoccupied? Oh, ah, no, I don't want to trouble... trouble you with my problems. Oh, but you must! What is it? Oh, I'm... I'm sure it's nothing. I just haven't heard from my Terry for nearly a week, and it's not like him. Oh, you know what they say. Youth must have its fling. But the world has changed since we were young. It's a much more dangerous place, and my Terry, well, he's so easily led. Ah, he's a splendid chap, a credit to you. Everything will be just fine. Thank you, Mrs. Huggins. Yes, I am sure you're right, Dr. Huggins. Always such a worry, being a parent. Never stops. Anyway, must be off, and I will see you next week. Thank you. Have a lovely evening, and don't worry! I'm sure you'll see him soon. That woman really is a treasure. And you are my treasure.
