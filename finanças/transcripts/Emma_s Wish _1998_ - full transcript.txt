♫ Trust me baby ♫ Trust me baby ♫ Trust me baby ♫ Ooh, baby ♫ Trust me baby ♫ Trust me baby ♫ Ooh, trust me my love ♫ I've been away for just a little while ♫ And every night I missed your sweet smile ♫ Now I'm back here - [Emma] Danny, Joy, wait for us ♫ And you're wondering, baby, have I been true ♫ Let me tell ya honey - Are you sure this is what you really want? - Uh huh. - (laughing) Happy birthday. (laughing) (speech drowned out by music) Danny, you wanna ride the skyship? - [Danny] Yeah. - Come on, then. ♫ Have a little faith in me ♫ Honey, I'm on your side - Balloons here. - You want one? - Yeah! - Which color? - A red one. - Here you are little lady. - A red one, thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Look at the island, honey. (patrons screaming) (laughing) - Hi, Mom! - Hi, honey. Hold tight. - [Attendant] Here you go. - Thanks. Here you are. - Ooh, look at this. - Wow. - Huh? - Looks good. - Where's Danny? - He's over there. - Get all four shots, you win any prize you want. (clanking) - Oh, look at that. - Incredible shot, Roy Roger's long lost brother. - (laughing) You got it, Danny. That's great. - Where'd you learn that, the army? (laughing) Be still, my heart. One more, and you're a winner. - You got it, you got it! That's it. - You got the magic, kid. - I'll take the bear. - Well. You could. Most folks, take the ring. (soft music) - Ring? - Not just any ring, a wish ring. You could wish for 100 bears, or a trip to Yellowstone. Perfect gift for a girlfriend. - How long will the wish last? - A month, a full month. Ya see? Just what I wished. - I'll bet. Congratulations, sweetheart, that was great. (laughing) - Mom, it's for you. It's for your birthday. - Oh, Danny. It's beautiful. - Make a wish. - (laughing) Do you mind if I save it for later? Because right now, I have everything I've ever wished for. Stand up straight. - Up you go, Joy, look right there. You're a big girl. - Yep. - [All Family] Cheese. - [Photographer] Nice. (phone ringing) - [Emma] Hello? - [Joy] Hi, Mom. - [Emma] Joy, where are you calling from? - [Joy] Home, I'm still at home. - Well shouldn't you be on the road by now? What's the matter? - [Joy] What do you mean, what's the matter? Nothing. - Are the children all right? - Couldn't be better. Can't I call my mother on her birthday without the third degree? - Of course, I was just thinking about the children. - Let me start over. Happy birthday, are you celebrating? - I think they're giving me a little party this evening, but I'll celebrate when I see you. - Mom, we can't make it, today anyway, this week. - Joy, are you sure nothing's wrong? - No, no, um, Iris loves kindergarten, Danny's a midfielder in soccer, I just rented space for my business, and Brian... - Joy? - Brian moved out. - What happened? - I found him with another woman. - Oh, Joy. Well out is where he should be. Do you need anything, money? - [Joy] No. - Have you talked to a lawyer? - [Joy] No, Mother, I haven't leapt into action yet. - Margaret Tunney's son is downtown at-- - I can take care of it. God knows I don't need a primmer. - I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'd be happy to come stay, be with the children. - No, they're a handful now, Mother. - But they'll be confused. Joy, I can help. - No, there's your medications, your arthritis. - Plus with the new business, there'll be cooking and cleaning. - I'm hiring a housekeeper for all that. I already put an ad in the paper. - Don't hire a stranger, save your money. - Mom, no. I have all I can deal with right now. I'm sorry, I have to go. Have a happy birthday. We'll come see ya soon. - That would be nice. - I love you. (beeping) (dial tone buzzing) - That Hamilton, he forgot to buy my lottery ticket again. How am I gonna win the lottery if I ain't got no ticket? - Money can't buy everything. - Well, we're right up on the 21st century, and when I reach that number, I'm gonna get me another new hip, I'ma get me a couple of them cute knees, I'ma have 'em suck out all the fat 'til I'm about size three. They got that technology, make ya young again, like magic. 100,000 dollar makeover. (sniffling) What's the matter, Joy didn't call? - She called. (sighing) - They're not coming. - No. - No card, no flowers, not even pictures of the children. Sharper than a serpent's tooth is an ungrateful child, Emma. - Brian's had an affair. He's moved out. - Ooh, I'm so sorry. - I felt so good about her life, her children. I always thought I'd grow old with them. - Well, life doesn't always stay on track, Emma. Sometimes we have to reset the train. - How could Brian do that? I wish I could at least be there. I wish, oh Mona. If wishes were horses. - I'd have a stampede. (laughing) - Happy birthday to, you ladies aren't even dressed yet! Emma's party is in 20 minutes. Mona, Hamilton said you rocked in therapy. You keep pushin'. We want that knee at 60 degrees by next week. Emma, you don't look a day older. I have got good news. I am up for the San Francisco director's position. Can you believe that? Me, Kelly Horner. But, I will miss this place forever. Hurry up, 20 minutes. Hi there. (door banging) - Too young for Prozac? - I need my music. (laughing) - You know exactly what they gonna serve. Chicken, mashed potatoes, and peas. What kinda birthday dinner is that? Ain't they never heard about a steak? - Oh, I'm not very hungry. Mona, have you seen my gold bracelet with the little, you know? (objects shuffling) I know it was here someplace. (slow, sentimental band music) - That's new. - My son gave it to me. I wore it until the day he died. (chuckling) - What better occasion. How do I look? - The truth? - Yeah. - You look 75, man-hungry, and indiscreet. - Perfect. (chuckling) - Oh, I suppose you're going to start saying that 75 is middle-aged. - Look at that Lena Horn, she's older than us, and both Eva and Jaja Gaboor are older than us. - Mona, Eva is dead. - Yeah, but she looked so good goin' out. Two drumsticks. I guessed that about you, Oscar, a man of appetites. (laughing) - 75 today, let's give her a hand. (applause) - [Man] Happy birthday! - Beautiful cake. - Look at this cake. - Make a wish. - [Woman] Happy birthday, Emma! (deep exhaling) (whimsical music) - Ooh! - Nice lungs. (sharp inhaling) - Well let's have cake. (guests speaking simultaneously) - That's it, that Oscar is a marked man. Bullseye on his chest. - Be careful the man you wish for. You just might get him. - Spoken like a woman who's oh for one. Whatever happened to your ex? - I have no idea. - None? You never heard from him? - It's the one thing I asked he did right. - Well happy birthday, baby. Hey, you gonna tell me what you wished? - No. If I did, it wouldn't come true. - What'd you wish last year? - That my grand children would visit. - Did you tell me that wish? - No. - Did it come true? - [Emma] No. - So what difference does it make? - Okay. I wished that I could live with my family, protect my babies, help them through this pain I know is coming, but my daughter. - Well, it's her loss. Sweet dreams. (soft music) (light clicking) (sprinkler hissing) (deep exhaling) (lively music) (groaning) (gasping) - Mona? Are you awake? - [Mona] No. - I must be dreaming. - Well my hip hurts. Take my left hip outta your dream, will ya please? - Mona. Something's happened. - Oh my lord, it's not your dream, it's my dream. You had the 100,000 dollar makeover. - It can't be real, look at my hair. Ow! - Well it ain't no wig. - This can't be happening. - Emma, that medicine you took last night, give me some of that. - I'm losing my mind. - [Mona] Well we can't both be goin' crazy at the same time. (whimsical music) - My wish. - [Mona] Well don't look at me. - You saw it, I know you did. - Saw what? The wind just blew around in the room a little bit, and that ring lit up, but these things happen, honey. - I wished that I could be with my children, and now I'm-- - 40 years younger, but, oh my goodness. But what does that have to do with joinin' your family? - I can leave. I can go to them. - Now you are dreaming. Emma, you are Joy's mother. She'll recognize you. What are you gonna do, walk in and stick your hand out and say, "After all these years, it's nice to see ya"? - I'll explain it to Joy. - Good, then maybe you'd like to clear up the Shroud of Turin while you're at it. Emma, they're gonna put you in Camorillo. - I'm her mother, she'll listen to me. - Well, the worst thing is, and you can sock me if you want to, Joy resents you. - Resents me, I don't think so. - You know exactly what I'm talkin' about. She avoids you, and she pouts, and the last thing in the world she's gonna do is listen to her mother. - Mona, this is my wish come true, from Danny, it has to be. I mean, why else would I wake up younger? What reason could there... (playful music) Housekeeper. - What are you talking about? - Joy is advertising for a nanny. Why not me? - Because, it, it, it's, it's just crazy. It's crazy. It's showtime. (laughing) Well you better hurry. She could fill that position quickly. Hey, don't go puttin' on those old lady's clothes. - I have to wear something. - Ta da da dum. (laughing) Now that's really styling. - It'll be a miracle if I don't get arrested. - Well you of all people should believe in miracles. Look what a deal you got, a second chance to love the people you thought you lost. Good lookin', that's good lookin'. (sighing) - You want it in cash? - Yes, please. Oh. Isn't that the worst driver's license picture you've ever seen? - (chuckling) Yes. 100, 200, 300, 400. - So, it's almost like 100% for sure that I'm gonna get this job. - [Girl In Plaid] Is your mom gonna let you? - [Girl In Dress] Yeah, she already said yeah. - [Girl In Plaid] You're kidding. (laughing) (lively music) - Miss? (blades scraping) - [Man] Hi. - No, I don't want you at the game. I don't want the kids to see us together with things this tense. Well then we can alternate games, but not today. You can pick them up Sunday morning. Goodbye. (beeping) Danny! We have to leave in five minutes. Did you find the ball? - I can't find it. I've looked everywhere. - Well check the backyard, honey. Come on, it's probably there. Hurry up. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, Iris? This is Grandma. - [Iris] My grandma? - Yes honey, you know, your mom's mom? - Oh, hi Grandma, I remember you. - (laughing) I bet you've grown an inch. - Grandma, we're going to the park. - Good. Honey, did your mother find a housekeeper to take care of you yet? - No. - Can I talk to her? - Danny, I found it, come on, get in the car. Iris, honey, in the car, come on. - She can't talk right now. We're late to the soccer game. - Oh okay, can you give her a message? Tell her that Grandma is going on vacation and I'll call her when I get back. - [Joy] Iris, honey, come on. - [Emma] Okay? - Okay, bye Grandma! (beeping) - Come on, honey, fast, quick, quick. (crowd cheering) - Kick it, kick it! - All right, Danny. Come on, come on. (grunting) (buzzing) Iris. (giggling) Iris? Iris. Iris! - [Emma] Here she is. - Oh, where did you go? - Miranda wanted to play on the swings, and she was bringing me back. - I had a feeling her mother might be missing her. Oh, and Miranda too, of course. - Oh, thank you so much. Okay, play but stay right around here, okay? Don't wander off, sweetie. I'm Joy. - I'm, Mame. - Well you're a life saver. I have enough stress in my life right now without a lost kid. Which one's yours? - Excuse me? - Oh, which child is yours? - Oh, oh, well, my children are grown. - Really? - Uh huh. - Oh, I thought you were here with the team. - No, I just come by on a volunteer basis. Actually, I'm between job interviews. - Oh Danny, over here. - Hey, Mom, we won! - Yes, you did. Honey, there's a towel in the car, go wipe off. - Okay. - What kinda work do you do? - Oh, you name it. Housekeeping, cooking, childcare. - You're kidding? - No. - Oh, what a shame. - Pardon? - I just hired someone on the way to the park. Miracle of cell phones. Well, thanks again, you're a saint. - No problem. - Good luck. - Thank you. - [Joy] Iris, honey, come on, let's go. Say bye. - [Iris] Bye. (somber music) - Mame? Um, the woman that I hired was torn between two offers. Could I buy you lunch? (children speaking simultaneously) - They are so bright. You must be proud. - Danny's a space cadet. He can recite every movie he's ever seen but he can't remember where the dirty socks go. (laughing) It drives me crazy. - Well, my son was like that at his age, head in the clouds. He'd lose his socks, but, he turned out to be a great kid. - What's he doing now? - Well, he died, a long time ago. - I'm so sorry. I had a brother who died in a car accident when I was a little girl. Danny's named after him. - Mame! Mame, come on. - Mame? Danny's calling you. - Oh! (laughing) I'm comin'. Show me again. - Okay, high five. Yeah! - Kids, wait in the car. - Okay. - It feels like fate that we met. I put that ad in the paper, there was just the one response. - You know, I think I saw that ad. It's the only one I circled. - Well, it is fate. Look, my life is kinda complicated. I'm in the middle of a divorce and I just started a business in graphic design. - You're an artist? - Well, it's all done with computers these days, but yeah, I hope so. Anyway, I need someone right away. - Well that's no problem, if this other person-- - I'll tell ya what. Give me a chance to call her and work that out, and then, problem solved. And then all that remains is, I check your references. - Right, (laughing), right. (playful music) - I revised our state charter, painted the west wing, re-landscaped, and that was my first week. But really, that is nothing like what I could do in Frisco. Oh, I'm sorry, you call it San Francisco, don't you? - Excuse me. - Um, hi there, have we met? - Yes. No, uh, no, I'm just visiting. - Oh good, a relative? - Yes, Mona Washburn. - That's great. But, enough about me. Let's talk about that city by the bay. - Well how do you know that? (knocking) - Hang up. - I'll call ya back, I'll call ya back. - That was Joy? - No, that was Painslow. I just hung up on two dollars a minute. How will I get my horoscope-- - Then Joy hasn't called yet? - No, why? - Because you're my reference for the job. Now my name is Mame Lewis. (laughing) - Mame? - It's an old scrabble trick. Look, nevermind. Your name is Regina Martin, and I worked for you for-- - Martin and Lewis? You must be kidding me. - I was rushed. Now all you have to do is... (phone ringing) - Hello? Yes, this is Ms. Martin. - This is Joy Bookman, I'm calling about a reference for a Mame Lewis. - Mame Lewis, oh yes, we love Mame. She is such a fabulous cook, and she is, oh, oh, yes, she's a spotless housekeeper. And she's so wonderful with children. I do not believe that Billy would be in Harvard today if it wasn't-- - Don't overdo it. - If it wasn't for Mame's corn chowder. - Is she even-tempered? - [Mona] Oh yes. - Is she reliable, is she a safe driver? - [Danny] Thanks, Mom. - Oh yeah, she drives like an old woman. - So there's no reason you'd hesitate to recommend her? - Oh mercy, no. If I weren't fresh outta children I would never have let her go. - Thank you, I really appreciate this. I think she's gonna be a Godsend. Bye. - Bye. (beeping) - What did she say? - I think you got the job. (laughing) Martin and Lewis. At least you could let me be the skinny one. (knocking) - Ms. Washburn? I'll be right back, gentlemen, a little housekeeping matter here. Ms. Washburn, can you please tell me, hello again, where can we find Emma Bridges? - Of course I can. She's, um, she's, um-- - On vacation, right? - Yes, on vacation, she left today. - Why, pray tell, didn't she let us know? - Well, I think she won the trip. It was one of those box top things. - I don't think so. Her bank just called verifying a withdrawal. A dark-haired woman in her 30s cleared out the account this morning. - Oh, it must've been a friend. I talked to Emma. I was supposed to tell you where she was going. - And that is? - Jamaica. - Jamaica. - Yes, why don't I have her give you a call when she checks in? - Please do. But, have her call me personally. This is a terrible time for discrepancies. I'll get back to you, okay? Gentlemen, cocktails? - [Man] Sure. (door banging) - It's one hotel room after another. It's unending, Denzel. (alarm buzzing) Damn, Emma. Did your body look like that when you was younger? - (laughs) I guess so. Look, I have to leave before they find me here. I hope tonight I'm at Joy's. - Your ex was a fool to leave you, I tell ya that, baby. - Well he didn't leave, I threw him out. - Why? - Well, let's just say that I wanted a husband that knew the meaning of faithful. - You gonna call that Kelly woman? - As soon as I can. Wish me luck. - Well you better hurry up. You don't know how long this thing gonna last. - Oh, you know, you're right. I could wake up old again tomorrow. - It's a shame wishes don't have warranties like 30-day guarantees. - It was 30 days. (whimsical music) Mona, the wish was to last a month. - Well, you better get goin', baby. (doorbell ringing) - Hi. - Good morning. - I went ahead and started the shopping, my treat. - Wonderful. - You know, we haven't even talked about terms. You wanna negotiate? - Well how about six dollars an hour plus room and board? For that, I'd do windows. - Kids, Mame's here. Oh, let me take that. - Ah, thanks. - Hi. - Hi. - I thought of a movie you might like. - Really? - Men in Black. - Was Bing Crosby in that? - I don't know. Was he the second spacepod? - I don't think so. - Hi. Do you remember my doll? - Of course, the well-traveled Miranda. Now did you warn her about wandering off from her mother? - Uh, not yet. (laughing) (horn honking) - That's Dad! Come on. - There he is. Oh yeah. - Yeah. (laughing) - Here's my girl. - I miss you, Daddy. - Knock knock. - Who's there? - Tickle. - [Iris] Tickle who? - [Brian] Tickle you! (laughing) - I get to push the radio buttons. - [Brian] Put your seatbelts on. - [Iris] We will. - You must be Brian. I'm Mame. - Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me about you on the telephone. - You have wonderful children. - Thank you. - These timeshare arrangements are always hard, but people do what they have to do, right? - I guess so. Tell Joy we'll be back at six. - Brian, wait a second. Please don't be late. Iris sees the psychologist tomorrow. I want her to get to bed early. - Fine. I got the flyer on the kids' school carnival at the end of the month. Why don't we all go together? - You know how I feel about that. - Right. We trade off. But it's a big deal to the kids and-- - We can't, they'll think we're together again and we're not. - I thought maybe this could be a trial. - No, Brian. - Joy, what do you want from me? I was wrong. - What I wanted from you was honesty and faithfulness. (somber music) - Can we at least talk? - I think there's supposed to be a lawyer around for that. (door banging) I apologize for that. - Oh, I understand. You have to keep it separate. Mom's time, his time. It's better for the children. - I thought you could sleep in here. Bath's down the hall, bring in a rollaway. It's Brian's study. I know it's not much, but-- - It's just fine. - Good. The rest we can figure out as we go. - Oh, work number's on the bulletin board, dinner at 6:30? - That's not too late for the children? - Uh, no. - It'll be ready then. - Oh, Mame, could you throw that in the laundry? The kids spilled on it. - Oh, right away. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - See ya later. - Bye bye. (upbeat music) (buttons beeping) - [Woman] Heavenly Days. - Hello, may I speak with Kelly Horner please? - [Woman] Who should I say is calling? - This is Emma Bridges calling. - [Woman] Ms. Horner, Emma Bridges for you. - 30 beds by May, excuse me. Emma, you're in Jamaica? - Yes, for a month. The weather's beautiful. - Excuse me one second. Oh, and here I thought it was hurricane season. What hotel are you staying at? - Um, actually I am staying with friends. (laughs) - Oh, would this be your friend who does your banking for you? - Yes, old friend, very old friend. - Good, well you have fun. I'm just gonna need a phone number. - Phone? - For our files, in case of emergency, that sort of thing. - Um, actually there's no number on this phone so I'll have to call ya back, okay? - Emma. - Bye bye. - Emma. (dial tone buzzing) - What are they gonna do, search Jamaica? (knocking) - Is anybody home? (lively music) Travel agents, itineraries, rum ads. (door banging) - Something smells terrific. My furniture. - You like? It seems so much better facing the light. (playful music) - What happened to Brian's things? - Oh, I boxed them in the garage. I thought it would be better for the children to have fewer reminders. - I'm not trying to banish Brian from the Earth. - Well, the sooner they get used to his absence the sooner they can-- - Oh wait a minute, I appreciate your concern but, this is my life. - I tried, I really did. - What's wrong with Danny? I didn't see this. - He saved it for me. I'm the one that helped him with math. - How could he get an F? Danny's good at math. - Maybe he's trying to make a point. - What? - Maybe he's trying to prove that he needs his father. You want me to come by a couple afternoons a week and work with him? - No, I'll do it. - Joy, you don't have to do everything. He still has two parents. - I know. - Fine. Let me know if you change your mind. - Brian, I'm sorry, you're going to be getting papers from my lawyer. I don't want it to be a surprise. - Thanks a lot. - I'm gonna go check on Danny. Mame, please don't throw away any more of my life. That's my job. (car engine igniting) Danny. - [Danny] What? I tried my best. - [Joy] I know, honey, but you shoulda told me about it. - Hi. - Well you're either a fast waker-upper or a very good actor. - I'm a good actor. What are you making? - Pirate stew. - Why is it called pirate stew? - Because it's made with round carrots that look like gold doubloons, and it's buried under a thick crust that looks kinda like sand and you have to dig for it with your fork. - Like buried treasure? - Uh huh. Look, I just happen to have some dough left. Would you like to make something out of it? - Okay. (phone ringing) - I'll be right back, honey. Hello? This is she. Jamaica? My mother? Well, she's said nothing to me about a vacation. - Nor did she take her passport. - [Joy] No passport? - Oh, there's no need to be alarmed. I've talked to her, her roommate's talked to her. I am sure that she is partying hardy, and if I didn't feel the need to cover certain bases I wouldn't even have called the police. - The police? Oh, I'm coming over. - Ah, I really don't think that's totally necessary. - I know it's not necessary for you, it's necessary for me. (phone slamming) My mother's been missing since yesterday morning from the retirement home. - Missing? - Something about a trip to Jamaica. That is way too much fun for my mother. - Well, maybe she needed a vacation. - Why wouldn't she call me? - Iris? Why didn't your grandmother call your mother? - I don't know. - [Joy] She's punishing me, that has to be it. - Punishing you? - For not visiting on her birthday. - Oh, I'm sure she's not like that. - Bye, honey. - Bye. - Well, see that Danny eats something. I'll be back as soon as I can. - They're not really going to call the police, are they? - Joy Bookman, I'd like you to meet Detective Steele and your mother's roommate, Ms. Washburn. - Hi. - Is my mother all right? - Of course she is. She's in Jamaica. - How, without a passport? - Who knows. All I know is, she said she needed a change and she took a month off. - [Kelly] Her luggage is still in storage. - Oh, she bought new clothes, yeah. - This is Emma Bridges we're talking about? - Ladies, I've enjoyed this discussion immensely. You should publish. Ms. Bookman, the department has no reason to think that there is a problem here, but I promised Ms. Horner we'd check the phone records to see if we can determine where your mother called from, Jamaica, Sun City, wherever. Here's my card. You can always call. Good day, ladies. - Thank you so much, Detective. There'll be no actual report on this, right? (door banging) - It wasn't bad news from a doctor, was it? Was her health good? - Oh, very. - Was there a boyfriend? - Well, not that I know of when she left, but baby, we live in hope. - I'm sorry we haven't met before. I haven't been around, I've had other problems. - And everybody knows that a mother's no good when you're havin' problems, hm? (soft music) - Are you all right? - Yeah. I don't know. - You know, after you left Iris remembered that her grandma had called and said she was leaving on a trip. - She did? Did she say where she was going? - I don't think so, but, you can ask her about it in the morning. But you must be starved. - This is pirate stew. - That's right. - My mother used to make it for my brother and me. - Oh, mine too. I'm from Missouri. Where's your mother from? - Missouri. - Must be a regional thing. I bet she taught you how to make it. - Nope. - No, I would've sworn, that, (laughs), well, every mother would teach their daughter how to cook. - Not mine. - I mean, she probably thought she was teaching me, but she'd keep doing everything, and I'd get mad and insist on mixing the flour myself and measuring the salt. She would taste the results and, not quite good enough. She'd say, "Nice," and I'd know it wasn't, not up to snuff. - Well, maybe when she said nice, she meant nice. - When was nice ever good enough for my mother? - Did your brother feel the same way? I mean, about her? - I don't know. I guess ultimately he failed her, too. Got himself killed. But that was because of me. She blamed me for that. - Oh, she didn't. - Why do you say that? - Well because I have a daughter and you don't blame a child for something like that. - You don't know my mother. - [Instructor] And one, and two. - I'm telling you, they're going to trace your calls. I might be talkin' to three feds right now. - What can I do, Mona? My daughter thinks I ruined her life, Iris is in therapy, I'm not leaving, not now, Mona, I can't. - All right, baby. I understand. - Oh, I think Joy's up. I gotta go. - All right, but you be careful. And from now on, my code name is Lolita. (phone beeping) - Sleep okay? - Off and on. I'm just not used to an empty bed. - Tell me about your business. - Oh, well, I do brochures, pamphlets, the computer can copy a photograph, anything. I've had this idea. I don't know if it'll work, but. - Come on, what is it? - Memory books, like for somebody's anniversary or maybe grandpa's life story. If I ever get the time, I'm gonna make a prototype. - Oh, families would love that sorta thing. - Yeah, I think so, most families. Not mine, of course. - Why would you say that? - Who wants to remember? My only brother died in a car crash, my mother thinks the world stopped the day he died, the last time I saw my dad he was off to live the life of his patron saint, Hugh Hefner. God, when my mother drove him out, I had to look up the word infidelity. I was horrified. I told my father I never wanted to see him again. - Well, better to be living with one good parent than two who are living a lie. - Yep, sometimes two bad choices are all ya got. - Sometimes it's a choice you have to make when you're stuck with a bad husband. - Oh, Brian was a wonderful husband, until he screwed up. - He slept with someone else? - I don't think sleep came into it. - It's a shame, but it's his doing, not yours. Some things are just unforgivable. - I'm sure you're right. It's just not what I wanted for my kids. (slow, jazzy band music) (chuckling) - Dear Joy, I pray for the day you'll write back. I trust in the lord and my beautiful wife, Angela. Love, Dad. - All right, thanks a lot. We'll call ya when it gets in. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. If that's lunch, I'm not that hungry. - No, I was thinking about your memory book this morning, and I uncovered this stuff, so, thought I'd bring it by. All this is perfect for a sample book, and just think about the extra money you might bring in. - I really don't have the time. - Oh, and there's these fun photographs and letters. I didn't mean to snoop, but, you should really look at these letters. (phone ringing) - A Joyful Look. This is she. No calls from Jamaica? - As best Detective Steele can figure, the only calls that have come here from your mother have been local calls. - But if my mother's here in town, then what is this about a vacation? - Well, he's not sure but clearly he's not worried, and I think we should all just take our cue from the police. There's no need to get excited until the sketch is done. - Sketch, they're doing a sketch? - Well, he's having that bank teller meet with a police artist, but it is all low, low priority, honest. Honest. - Okay, Iris, five. Two, three, four. - Yes! - Oh no. - You owe me 450 dollars. - Don't gloat. - Mame, could I borrow some money? - Oh, of course, sweetheart. (laughing) (phone ringing) - You're lucky I only had one hotel. Could've cost ya more. - Hello? I'm Joy Bookman. Saint Luke's Hospital, is it my mother? What? - [Danny] It's your turn Mame. - Oh, just a minute, honey. - Thank you. (beeping) - Joy, what is it? - They said they called me as next of kin. - Brian? - No, my father. I haven't seen him in 25 years and now they call to tell me he's dying. - Well go ahead, I'll get the children to bed. - No. What's the point of some deathbed scene with a man I don't know? So he can feel better? I'd rather stay with my children. Okay, who's turn is it? (somber music) (beeping) - Harry? Don't be nervous, I'm not some kook off the street, I just wanted to-- - Hello, Emma. - You know me? - You never forget your first love. - Really? I don't know how you kept track. - You're as pretty as the last time I saw you. - Doesn't that surprise you? - No. Danny came by to visit me at the hospital today. - Danny, our son? - Yes. He looked the same, too. - I can't stay, the hospital called Joy, and-- - [Harry] Good. - She's 38 now, Harry. - I know that. - [Emma] She can't come. - Well I tried over the years. She never wrote back. - You hurt her, Harry. - That's why I wrote her. She never stopped being my child, half of my heart. But I wanted her to know I never stopped loving her, not for a minute, and that I'd given up the scotch, and that I married a wonderful woman. - Angela. - [Harry] Yeah. - How did you meet? - I was a coach when we got married, remember? - 'Til my father hired you, thank god. - I went back to coaching, at a Catholic girls school. Angela was a teacher there. She loved kids, but we couldn't have any. Funny, huh? Angela died last year. I think Joy would've liked her. - Well, it looks like you've made a lot of friends. I'm glad you finally found a woman that could make you happy. - You made me happy. It's just with Angela, who I was was enough. (soft, sentimental music) - Our daughter has two beautiful children. Iris is five and her boy is nine, Danny. - Danny, huh? Ah, I'd give anything to see them. Danny. That's a good sign, Emma. I always thought she blamed herself for his death. - She does. - No, I always took care of the car. Maybe if I woulda checked the brakes. When a child dies, it's hard enough. No one's to blame. - I tried to tell her. - Maybe if she had a father, it would've helped. - I want her to see you. If I kept her from you, Harry, I was wrong. I never meant to hurt you. - I forgive you, Emma. Some day maybe you'll forgive me. Watch. It'll make all the difference. - Joy, are you up? - What time is it? - Nine o'clock. - Oh, I've a million things to do. Thank you, good morning. - [Emma] Good morning. - How'd you sleep? - Not too well, kept thinking about you and your father. I think you should see him, Joy. I think it's important. - I can't. It's like an old wound, Mame. What's the point? - There are lots of points. I mean, what if his illness is hereditary? What if there's an inheritance? - Mame, no more Chicago hope. - It's not those things. It's Danny and Iris. This is the one chance they'll ever have to meet their only grandfather, to make that connection with family. So how did you sleep? - Not so well. I mean, he is my father. - I can have the kids dressed in 20 minutes? - Remember what we talked about, let me tell him about your father. - I think that should be at the end. - After the cookies. - Hi, we're here to see a patient, Harry Bridges. - One of our most popular guests. Third floor, room seven. - There's room seven. - Joy, I'll wait outside. - Oh, please come in, meet him. - No, it's your family, you do it, Joy, just the three of you. (sighing) - Let me just get this one other plant. You're looking for? - Harry Bridges. - Oh. - What's wrong? - I'm so sorry. (melancholy music) - Services were Thursday. I talked to Helen Thomas and the Steiners, they used to live next door, and none of them have heard from Mother. You either? That's sweet. If you hear from her, call, okay? Bye. I don't understand, where is she? I'm not surprised she didn't go to the funeral, but if she's here in town, why hasn't anyone seen her? - Oh, she's probably having the time of her life. - I'm really starting to get worried, Mame. If anything happened to her-- - She calls her roommate. - Oh, yeah, she's in Mona's Rolodex along with the psychic hotline and boys-R-us. It's too weird, Mame. Something is wrong. - You did it. A memory book. - Oh. Yeah, it's rough. I started to piece it together after my father died. You were right, the pictures worked out pretty well. - Is this the brother that had the accident? - Danny, yeah. - Do you remember it? - It's hard to talk about. I was 10, and I was staying all night at my best friend's house. We had this stupid quarrel. I called home at two in the morning begging to be picked up. Danny was 16, just starting to drive. He never made it. - When you called home, did Danny answer the phone? - No, it was Mom. - Then who's decision was it to send Danny that night? - My mother's. - She could've driven. It was her choice. Joy, she's probably suffered that choice her whole life. - She never told me. Mom, Dad, everyone went off into their own tomb. - Well she probably didn't know that you felt that way, and your dad never would have let you blame yourself for Danny's death. - How can you know that? - From his letters. I think he would have told you that the death of a child is the worst thing ever, but what happened to Danny was no one's fault, and families should never, never let tragedy keep them from comforting and loving one another. He'd tell you that, Joy, if he could. - Guess we'll never know, will we? (gentle music) - It's been three weeks, Brian, sign the stipulation. - I don't have to sign. - Well, then we go to trial and you need a lawyer. - I am a lawyer. - Not a family lawyer, and as Joy's representative I've gotta advise you-- - No, let me advise Joy. Joy, don't do this, not now. Let me show you that I'm better than a mistake I made. Don't make a worse mistake. - Oh, wait a second. Don't compare protecting my children to adultery. - What do you mean, protect? They don't need protection from their own father. - From his morals? I think they just might. - Joy, that is ridiculous. - Mommy, Daddy, what's wrong? - Please Joy, let me help with this. Let's talk to her together. - No. - What's the matter? - Iris heard us fighting, she's upset. - Well, you want some more coffee? - Ah, what the hell. I'm not gonna sleep anyway. - I'm sorry. It's hard what this is doing to the children. - I know. If I could change what happened. - What did happen, Brian? - I spent six months working on a case, on contingency. You only get paid if you win. - And you lost? - It was an out of town trial. Six months of income down the drain. I didn't know how to tell Joy. She just started her new job. I went to the hotel bar and I got drunk. There was a woman. Joy called the room at the wrong time. I tried to explain to her that it was a one-time thing. - It's still wrong. - Absolutely. I have kicked myself a thousand times, but I can't change it. - Well I will say this: you've never been less than a good father. - I'll never be anything but. Never. I just want her back. I guess, some things are unforgivable. - Says who? - Joy. - Well, she's just hurt, Brian. People can't hear when they're hurt. Don't give up on your family. I know someone like Joy who threw away 30 years of happiness. Don't let that happen, don't give up. - Tell Joy I'll call her. Tell Elkin he's off the clock. (upbeat music) - You're not the mouthpiece that sprung Spike Cleveland, are ya? - I'm a tax attorney for God's sake. I just wanna find out about my wife's mother. - Well, who's the mother? - Emma Bridges. - So I have a case and, wait, not the old woman? - She's 75. - At the home, the one who lives with Lucille Ball, on vacation? - That's the one, what's the story? - She's on vacation, that's the story. For a month. If she doesn't come back we'll consider foul play. - I wanna help find her. - Try the Boy Scouts. - It's important to my wife. It's important to me to do this for my wife. - Good luck on your merit badge. Call me in a couple of weeks. - Just give me a copy of the sketch, then. - What sketch? - The retirement home said there was sketch of the woman at the bank. - There's no sketch. I said low priority, I meant it. We didn't do one, we may never. - Fine, I'll take this up with Murray Samuels, then. - Who? - He represents the department and liability lawsuits, I believe. - Don't try to muscle me, counsel. - What muscle? An elderly woman has her bank account wiped out by a female reported in her 30s. Said elderly woman is supposed to be in Jamaica without a passport, and no one has seen her for the last three weeks, save for Lucille Ball. You don't see the need for a sketch? I'll speak with Murray. - All right. But we need a full day for the sketch. - 24 hours, I'll be there. - We'll lift the rock for ya. - I'm sorry about this. Usually when I invite someone to lunch on the spur of the moment, it's china and linen. - Oh, no, no, I love this place. We used to come here on special occasions and get cotton candy. I don't know why I loved cotton candy. - Has it changed much? - No. But I have. - Well, so have I, since I've been with your family. - How? - Oh, the way I see things. Joy, I think you're making a mistake divorcing Brian. - But you were the one who said that some things are unforgivable. - I know, I was wrong. - But he broke our wedding vows, Mame. - Joy, was the marriage good before? - Yes. - Well, sometimes broken things can be mended instead of thrown away. Sometimes they turn out to be stronger than before. - Thank you, Abigail Van Buren. He slept with another woman. How could I ever trust him again? - The question is love, can you ever love him again? - I didn't know lunch came with a sales pitch. (seagulls cawing) - Look, I know what you're feeling. I've been where you are. Joy, after we lost our son, my husband had an affair and I locked him out, locked him out of my life. I hid, and I lost everybody. Don't make the same mistake I made. - Mame, I know you mean well, but I've worked very hard to let go of Brian and I can't go through it again. - Don't do this to the children. - I didn't, he did. You know, speaking of the children, shouldn't we pick them up at school? - I know it's none of my business. - You don't even know Brian. - Look, I wouldn't say anything if I didn't-- - Mame, you're not my mother. (somber music) - Is tomorrow our day with Daddy? - No, the next, honey. - Maybe Danny and I could just go live with Daddy, and Mommy could come live with us. Then we'd all be together again. - Makes sense to me, sweetheart. (dramatic music) (phones ringing) (indecipherable chatter) - Here ya are, counselor, your own personal sketch of public enemy number nine million. Ever seen her before? - I don't know. - Why don't you frame it? It's a limited edition, just one for you and one for my file cabinet. - What do you mean, you're molting? - Well, I don't know what else you'd call it. My hand looks exactly like it did before. - Lord, have mercy, you're changing back? - But the wish was to last a month. I remember exactly. We were on the pier, it was my birthday, and the man said, oh no. - What's the matter? Oscar, baby honey, go get me some punch. No fruit, the high octane kind. Emma. - It was February, not 30 days, 28. Mona, the wish ends day after tomorrow. - Oh my goodness. - I've signed up to work at the kids' carnival tomorrow. Please, can't we go together? - I have to work all weekend. - It's just a job, Joy. - That job is my livelihood now, and I have to get to it. - Well who will watch 'em while I'm at the booth? - Mame will take them. - Have you asked her? - Not yet, but she's always. - [Brian] Where is she? - She's at the nursery, getting plants for the backyard. - I was on my way there anyway. Fern problem. I'll ask her myself. (birds chirping) Mame. Hi. - Brian, what a surprise. - Joy told me I'd find you here. I need to conspire with you. - Conspire. (laughs) Well, I've got all these plants in the back and they really need to get in the ground, so-- - It won't take a minute. The Savannah Cafe is just down the block. Buy ya a cup of coffee? Please, it's about the children - Of course. - I'll meet ya there. - Oh Brian, can I turn left out of this lot? - Yeah, sure. - Okay, thanks. (upbeat music) Oh thank you, there's two of us. - Okay. - So what is it about the children? - I was gonna ask you to find a reason not to take my kids to the carnival tomorrow. - Why? - So that Joy would have to come with us, to watch them. We could be a family again. - Well, that's a great idea. - I'm not asking that now. - Why not? I mean, anything that gets you and Joy together-- - Why? Why is that so important to you, Mame? - Because it's important for Joy, for the children. - Leave my children out of this. - Brian, what, what's wrong? - Excuse me, here you go. - You've seen the sketch. - Yes. - And you think-- - What I think is that you have something to do with the disappearance of Emma Bridges out of some sick fixation over my family. - Brian, it is not what you're thinking. - Oh, so you have a perfectly reasonable explanation as to why you stole my mother-in-law's entire life savings, and you lied to get into Joy's house? - Okay, I did lie to Joy, but-- - My god, it's the hand that rocked the cradle, and that's the hand. - I didn't steal anything that didn't belong to me and I've never hurt anyone. - Where is Emma Bridges? - I don't have time to make up something you'll believe. - I would prefer the truth. - The truth is, the truth is, I'm Emma Bridges. - Wrong movie, it's Psycho. - I know it sounds crazy, but for a month, I'm young again. - What, did your fairy godmother grant you a wish? - No, it was my son. - Your son is dead. - Brian, you have got to believe me. I made this wish and it was granted and I'm here and now I have just one more day. - No, you have just one more minute. The police are on their way here right now to arrest you. I just called them. - Oh Brian, you shouldn't have. You shouldn't have done that. - Whoever you are, this is my last chance to get Joy back. I'll try to get you help but you're not leaving. - Brian, (laughing) ask me something that only Emma would know. - All right. On our wedding, Joy had the band play a special song for her mother. - Save the Last Dance For Me. I used to sing it to Joy when she was a baby. I'd dance her around the room and she would always stop crying. - You've brainwashed her. Where is Emma? - I am Emma! If I had time, I would give you evidence, fingerprints, but if they arrest me now, how will I explain? Please, please, let me go. - Excuse me. (suspenseful music) - Please. - No, no way in hell. My god, it's Phantom of the Opera. - I'm growing old again, can't you see? - It's movie stuff, makeup. - Brian, when I danced with you at your wedding, I told you that ever since Danny died that I had missed having a son, and how glad I was that you might be a son to me. Please. (crying) Be that son now. (sirens wailing) - Emma? (laughing) (sentimental music) Go inside, ladies room. I'll take care of 'em. - [Emma] Thank you. - Well? - She drove away a couple minutes ago. - What? - I was wrong, and I'm sorry. It wasn't her. - I heard you can win goldfish. - [Iris] Goldfish, how do you win goldfish? - White gloves, you are way too formal for a carnival. - (laughing) Sun, I can't be too careful. - I'll try and be home for dinner, have a good time. Have fun kids. - [Iris] Bye. - Joy, come with us. - No, it's Brian's time and I have to work and it's better for everyone. - Not for them. - Why do you make this so hard? - Joy, I'm about to make this harder. I have to quit, this is my last day. - Why? Is this blackmail? - No, it's not that. You're doing what you think is right, what you've been taught. Look, I'm sorry. I can't stay, I can't explain. - Fine. If that's the way it is, I better get to work and get on the phone and find someone else. - I'm sorry, Joy. - [Danny] I wonder if they have caramel apples at the carnival? - [Iris] What's a caramel apple? - Thank you. (gentle music) (cheering) - [Man] To you, Kelly. - No, no, lend me a toast to you. I may be going to San Francisco but my heart stays right here at Heavenly Days, 'cause you guys made it work. I may have been the queen, but you were my subjects, and I will never forget these past nine weeks. - [Woman] Cheers. - Miss Horner? - Excuse me. (upbeat music) - We've been holding Emma Bridge's mail, like you said, and I noticed she got this registration from the DMV. - Uh, she bought a car? What is it, license plates? - I thought it might be important. What do we do? - You know, that's not my problem. Why don't you call that detective. (laughing) Leo, hi. - [Leo] Hi. - Not that it matters to me, of course, but when does that New York job open up? - Okay, wait for me, Danny. Come on. There we go. So, what rides do you guys wanna go on? - [Danny] I wanna go on the ferris wheel. - [Iris] I wanna go on a row boat. - So you can reach me here at the office or you can call me at home later tonight, thank you. (sighing) (splashing) - Whoo! (laughing) - Dad, you look like you're dry. - I am. - Not for long. - Give me your best shot. Hi there, young lady, how are you? - Well, not that young. I asked Joy to come, but she wouldn't. - No mother ever tried harder. Thank you. All right, come on, see if you can hit it. Hey there, you missed me. - Okay honey, it's your turn. Aim for the red circle. - Oh! I'm gettin' scared. Ah! More power, dude, you gotta get tough. - [Emma] Get ready, sweetie. (playful music) - Woah! - Mommy! - Mom! - Hey, who's the new chick? (laughing) You throw like a girl. Ah! (splashing) (laughing) - [Danny] Good job, Mom! - Thanks. - [Iris] Good aim, Mom. (suspenseful music) Where's Daddy? - Dad? (gasping) (laughing) - You jerk. - Joy, Joy, wait a second, wait a second. - Danny, stay with me, stay with me. This is between Mommy and Daddy. - Are they gonna get in another fight? - Oh, I don't think so. And you know what? I wanna ride the merry-go-round. Let's go. - Joy, Joy, wait a second, wait a second. I'm sorry I scared you, it was stupid. - Even for you. I don't know what I'm doing here. - Look, I'm glad you're here. Don't, don't move. - What about your dunking thing? - This is more important. Ta da. It reminded me of that old picture of you and your family. - You think you can charm me with a quarter's worth of fluff and distant memories? - It was 50 cents. (whimsical music) - Let's go on the tilty-whirl. - Oh, I promised your mom I'd get ya home for dinner. - Are Mommy and Daddy coming? - Mm, not yet, sweetheart. And let's not bother them, okay? Let's go find the car and.... (upbeat music) Kids, I know a good ride, one more. - What? - Taxi. (gentle music) - Look Mame, I made your name. - Oh, that's wonderful, sweetheart. Good speller, too. - Mame, is there something wrong with your hand? - Oh, oh no, it's just sore from gardening. It'll be fine. - Good, 'cause you gotta drive me to little league tryouts next week. - I hope I can. - What do you mean? - Well, it's just that as much as I love you and Iris, I won't be able to stay forever. - Why not? - Remember the story about Mary Poppins? - [Children] Mm hmm. - Well, I'm a nanny, and someday I'll have to leave. - But who will make our pirate stew? - Might be your mother, or your grandma. - Grandma? - Grandma Emma? - Just remember that wherever I go, I'll always be thinking of you. - But it's not like you have to leave right now. - No. But, someday soon. - Grandma! - Hey, cool. - How about that. It's almost like they're the same person. (laughing) (soft, sentimental music) (whimsical music) (laughing) - [Joy] Don't wake the kids. Shh, shh, don't wake Mame. (thudding) (dramatic music) - Why so early? - I'm changing fast. I can't risk waiting any longer. - The last time I saw your car, a very angry detective was sitting on the hood vowing to wait all night if necessary. - Well, there's a bus stop at the corner. - Take my car. I'll come on the sly and pick it up at your home later on. - No, I'm not going there, not 'til it happens. - Why? - I'm scared. (laughs) It's been too perfect. If something happens, I wanna be at the pier. - I understand. (gentle music) - Mommy, Mame's gone, she's not in her room. - Honey, she's probably in the kitchen. - No, and all her clothes are gone. - Iris, Mame will never be gone. Not really. - You know where she is. Tell me. Brian, no secrets, never, you promised. - We need to get dressed. (whimsical music) (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) There she is. - Mame! (lively music) (grunting) (whimsical music) - You're not Mame. - Grandma? - [Emma] Yes, dear. - Are you tired? - It's been quite a month. (laughing) - We've got a room for you at home. You'll have to live up to a remarkable woman. - I'll try. - I've missed you so much. - Well, we can't let that happen. (sniffling) - I love you, Mom. - I love you too, sweetheart. - Danny, Iris, let's go home. (gentle sentimental music) (playful music)
