How can you protect Shounan with five people? You don't know... what's going on around here now... You'll be next. Yokohama? If you need some help, ask... You should study harder. What's it? You have a flat tire. Yeah... Total is 3200 yen. Who is paying for this? He is... 3200 yen. They are stupid... One more time. All right. All right. What are you doing here? He looks very nervous.

Hmm... it's pretty funny. Are you making a funny video? It's not a joke. Make something wild. OK. Here is some ramen. I gave you extra noodles with no charge. Eat quietly. Let's check the rule. Eat three noodles at a time. Don't eat BBQ pork with noodles. You'll lose your tum. We have your penalty from last time. Can we put the penalty on our tab? Don't drink all of the soup, OK? I'll kick you out. Everyone needs to pay 70 yen. We always fight about this so Shigeru will be the judge. Why me? OK. Eat. You start... Delicious. Eguchi, you better wait... Hey... Stop. Oh! You need to pay your ramen! Hey, come back. I wish we could have money for gas, ramen, dates... I have a good idea. We spent too much money now. Budget our money better. I want to make a club called "Adventure Tea Club" if possible. We don't want to have a part-time job. Thank you. Please stand up if you agree with this idea. Excuse me... What's your problem? What's "Adventure Tea Club"? Shut up. Let me explain... The club promotes the beauty of Shounan. We ride motorcycles and drink tea at the local cafe... ...go to Mt. Fuji. Bicycle is enough. Shut up. Welcome. Eguchi should ask more about this job before he decided we should do it. Would you like some tea? Vitamin C... Tami, don't come here... Tami, don't come here... Would you like to try this? It's green tea. Does Akira have the same hair color every day? He may change his hair color once in a while. We should check them out. Please read. The man... is waiting... they said. Pretty good. My pronunciation is better. 0K. ...next page 71. Please read. You can't pretend you are sleeping... You have to come to the meeting today. I have to work today. We have to prepare for a craft fair soon. You decide... for us. You are the leader. Didn't I say I quit? No. You can't. No. I quit... I quit... You are out... now. Eguchi has decided the theme will be Mt. Fuji. We should decide how we start this project. Color? Eguchi, design ideas? Where did he go? I knew it! Do thinkI can run into the Shoubaku group? Ten‘ible ride! What are you doing? Let me show you how to do this right. It's dangerous. Stay away from here. It's not fair. You don't die... It didn't really hit me. Let's go home. Sony. I'll deliver it to you right away. Sony. Sony. You don't have newspaper, either? I have new workers. Sony. Deliver to everyone now. Beat up all group riders. OK? Do you understand now? How should we deal with the Shoubaku group? They are the best in Shounan, but what can five people do? You are a part of us now. Keep up with us. OK? I heard they do anything to win their game. Gonda got beat up the other day. Shoubaku group is next. How does Eguchi deal with the group? I don't know. He'll figure out... Thanks. Eguchi has some ideas on how he wants to manage. He can be strong when he wants to be... The only thing that he hasn't changed is he still has no money. Oh, no. I didn't want garlic. I have a date tomon‘ow. I wish I was still young... How long are you going to be his motherly friend? You should tell him how you feel. Eguchi is a popular guy. You guys go home together... That's all you have done? You always ask about us. It's not fair. What? I want to buy something for Akira. What should I buy...? Is it his birthday? No. What's it for? It's an anniversary. An anniversary? Yes. What... anniversary? Did you...? What's wrong? ...because... Don't imagine wild things... Where is Eguchi today? The guys are hanging out again... Hi, Miyoshi. It's me. Kanbayashi? This is Ishikawa calling. Is Tami there? Oh, thank you. Is Tami there...? You listened to my conversation. Stop. Yokohama Otogi? You don't know? We are pretty famous around here. Hmm... What's it? I haven't seen you since junior high school. You have changed a lot. Did I change...? You look good... you look delicious. It's a good thing. I guess I should be happy. I'll tell Akira... They were smiling... and... Then... I don't know if they were going somewhere or just got back. What do you think? I don't know. You know... The old man gave me the look. So... I couldn't think... Akira, what are you doing? If you don't tell me the truth, I'll do this to you. How do you know? Who is he? We went to the same junior high school. That's all. Are you jealous? Shut up. I'm happy. Do you know the Yokohama Otogi group? Hmm? He belongs to the group. He asked if he can call me... but I told him I have a boyfriend. Please open this. Tami game me this. Does it look good on me? Do you think we would say we like it? Let's go. WaI11ing: Bear. Dangerous. WaI11ing: Bear. This is for you. Thank you. Where are Eguchi and the rest of guys? They went to Shige and Mako. I feel comfortable at school, but I feel different now. Do you want some ice cream? Sure. I'll get some for us. You look even better today. Thank you. Don't give me the look. Would you like some tea? No. I'm with my boyfriend now. A boyfriend? It's me. Akira. What are you doing? I'm sony. You are the one that belongs to the Yokohama group. Stop. Akira, stop. Stop. Akira, stop. Don't ever talk to us again. You better keep your eyes on her. You... I'm Akira from Shoubaku. Don't mess with me. Shoubaku? Hey. I said hey... Tami. You'll beat up everyone who talks to me...? Everyone...? That's ten‘ible. Akira, please stop. It was just a game... It was just a game... I thoughtI could quit riding motorcycles. You looked good when you were younger. You still look good. Oh, please don't forget I don't like garlic. Everyone is freaking out that Akira beat you up. Is he good? Yeah. The next person is... If they want to ride motorcycles here, they can... They'll take over the Shounan areas, you know? Tami asked you not to..., didn't she? We aren't gangs. We just like to ride motorcycles here, right? Everyone can ride Shounan. So, stop fighting. Eguchi, you cheated again. You came to make fun of me? You really like hospitals, don't you? I like hospital food. We heard you are serious... but you look good. Seven stitches... I'm tough. Don't write there... Otogi's girlfriend came here to visit the other day. She asked me about Eguchi. Don't mess with Otogi. I'll deal with him when I get out. You didn't bring anything? How ten‘ible! Kids! We are kids. You look like a grown-up. An old man... Don't make fun of me. Sejima, beat them up. Hello. It's unfortunate that they know your name. They are kids. Let them go now. Why don't they have silver colored thread here? The thread has to be silk, too. Don't get so upset. Oh, I know one more shop. Let's go there. It's 360 yen. Do you want French fries with this? She isn't interested, isn't she? Too bad... Yes, this is what we wanted! Eguchi, stop it. Let's go. Please... Leave them alone. We'll get something to eat. Your hair is ten‘ible. How could you walk with an ugly man like him? Please go. Please... Please go. Please... You are brave walking with a woman in Yokohama. Eguchi, you are so chicken. We'll beat you up. Don't mess with us. You destroyed my thread... Try me. Please don't fight. I don't want you to fight with people. I knew he has a girlfriend... We'll kill them... revenge. Let's go. Come to the warehouse tomon‘ow at 6 PM. Can we start sewing the snow part now? No. Let me show you how to sew snow here. Are you going to beat up the Shoubaku group up? How long are you going to fight with them? Nami, you better stay home. Everyone is nice, you know? They just like to ride motorcycles. That's all. Please stop. Please stop. What's the difference? We are the same... Are you saying we are the bad guys? Don't preach me. Please... You don't even have friends. You are just lonely. Did you see Akira? You're not going on a date. I know... I need to clean up my business. Please don't go. Please don't fight with my brother. Where is Eguchi? He went to buy thread near a train station. Did you come here alone? I'm Akira, the Shoubaku leader. Try me. Eguchi went to fight alone. Let's go. Get out of here. Where did he go? She knows... Take me there. Don't mess with us. Do you want to fight alone? Shut up. I don't like how you guys fight. Come on. I'm a good fighter. Are you scared? I asked if you are scared... Who are you talking to? Are you all right? We are here to assist you. I'll send you to the hospital... The Shoubaku group is here. Akira. I'm here to help you. What are we going to do with the snow part? Eguchi is the only one who knows how to do this. Why can't we share Shounan? We aren't gangs. We enjoy riding Shounan. You should do the same. Why don't you want us to ride Shounan? We'll fight for Shounan. Let's ride... and find out who is better... OK. Ride... The speed is 100km/h. The distance to the wall is 300m. Whoever uses brakes first will be the loser. Are you serious? Are you scared? Let me go first. Brother. Stop! Please stop! You don't have to wony about me anymore. Brother. Stop. You scared me... what kind of ride was that? This is a game. Let's enjoy this game. Nice attitude. I want to ride with him again. Scary. It was scary. Let me go to school. My attendance is ten‘ible. Idiot! This is the best time to ride. What's your name? May I have your number? The End
