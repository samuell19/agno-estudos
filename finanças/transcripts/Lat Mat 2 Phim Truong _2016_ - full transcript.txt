Did you bring enough money for me? Where is she? Of course she is safe now, unless you're late. Let's see what you can do. You have three minutes to handle this. Don't open it! It will explode! Get out of here. It's too late. You have to go. If we have to die, we will die together. I have no regret in loving you. Cut! Hold the scene. Hurry up! I'm exhausted. Let's rest. - Hey! - What now, Uncle? - Go out there and get me the match cut. - All right. Hoang, what do you think about this scene? I think it's okay. Lay down still. I need to do the match cut. Thank you. Are you all right? Oh, no. Your foot is swelling up. Get in here. I will put some ice on it. Thao, with this condition, can you still shoot the next scene? I'm not sure. Stay here. Let me do the match cut. Could you move aside? Let me photograph him. Thank you. Are you okay? I'm fine. But the mask was broken and can't be used anymore. Thank you. I would be dead without you. You're overthinking. That's their business. Do you have nothing else to do? Make some air! Go over there to rest. - You know what? - Hi, Uncle! - We have to sacrifice for the art. - Well done. Within an artistic atmosphere, we have to sacrifice because art is the pinnacle of humanity. What is it? - Uncle. - Did the stick hit your belly? - The stick is here. - No. God, it looks so real. Uncle, are the action scenes okay, or do we need to reshoot? No need. The scenes were smooth, and I'm very satisfied, especially with the explosions. You guys did very well. I was afraid that you didn't make it in time. Worst case, some bones would be broken. You worry too much. I can jump out of an airplane. This one is just two-floor height. - Very good. - Uncle. - Mr. Son. - Congratulations. - Hi. - Hello, Uncle. Uncle, did my message help you find this place easier? It would be easier without your messages. Hey, Tam! Why didn't you send someone to pick him up? No need. I have some work nearby, so I drop by to visit you guys. I admire your works. We're professional. We always put our hearts into our work. What a magnificent scene! We're lucky to have Trung here as the action director, hence the spectacular action scenes. Today is our lucky day. We had lots of problems previously. No worries, Trung is here. No need to bother you guys anymore. Let's get back to work. Okay, please wait for me outside. Trung, go and prepare for the next scene. The casts are not fully here. Please don't say you send them the wrong text again. I did, actually. Gosh! If you're not my wife's nephew, I would have fired you a long time ago. Have you ever ridden and slept at the same time? I have and fallen off the bike all the time. Then let's drive slowly. It'd take forever if we drive slowly. Where are we going? I'm meeting my brother. What does he do? He works as a stuntman for some foreign company. - Really? - Yes. - How about you? What do you do? - I have no job. Oh, my God! You're such a young guy! Being jobless is like... - Hey! - Oh, I forgot again. People will say you're just a mooch. Just for now. I had a pretty good job before. LIP, EYEBROW, EYELINER TATTOOING BUY TWO GET ONE FREE Hey, you tattoo, right? Is it expensive? It depends. Strong or light colors, big or small, but I'm having a promotion, only 100,000 VND a piece. Really? Then tattoo a whole set for me. Okay, I will turn you into Moon Goddess. Oh, it hurts! Ouch! It hurts! Oh, God! That hurts! Who is screaming inside? - Get out. Let me see. - It hurts so much! Honey, am I beautiful? Son of a bitch! I'll kill you! You ruined my family! - Get out! Calm down! - You turned her face into demons! I'll kill you! - Hey, focus on driving! - Oh, I forgot. I forgot. Then you don't love your job at all. I do. I dedicated so much to my job over many years. You wouldn't understand. I'm here trying to earn some money, then go back and fix my fifth aunt's face, and I will be back at it. You're right to think that way. Just like me. I'm sick of falling down all the time, but I still love my job. Okay, Pay attention. Explosives were buried all over this place. You have to remember the marked places and avoid them when you run and attack, - or else it will be very dangerous. - I'm done. I quit! No more filming. What do you think? How can I film those dangerous explosive scenes... - Vy! - ...without any stuntmen? Not professional at all. Why did you say that? We don't have enough stuntmen. Stuntwomen are even more scarce. She's the only one, but don't you see she's injured? I don't care. No stuntman, no filming. Please show some respect. Tam, get out. Please try to help me finish this scene, Vy. I'm helpless otherwise. Camera, action! Do you have any change? God! You're my first customer this morning. How would I have some change? Just give me the big bill, I will give you back the change later. Are you kidding? - I'm not kidding. - No! Hey, someone's fighting. It's my brother! Please help him! Hurry up! You! Bullying my brother? What? - Run! - Where are you taking me to? - Are you crazy? - Don't go that way. - This way! - Stop! Stop! There are bombs! - This way! - No! Cut! What's the fuss out here? Hey, where did you come from? Where? Didn't you know that we were filming? You ruined everything! Are you guys crazy? What have you done? We were filming here! What kind of crew is this? Please understand, Vy. What? You're filming? God, I'm in a movie. My neighborhood will be so excited. - Who are... - Who are you? Why are you here? Motorbike taxi. Why are you here? - Fire! - Fire! - What fire? - Put out the fire! Watch out! - Are you nuts? - No, but you are. The fire won't kill me, but you hitting my head with this will. - But there's a fire! - Nothing is on fire. Look. Take it out. No more fire. Ouch. See? Nothing. Just a wig? This is my real hair, this is a wig. Why do you wear a wig? Too sunny. Trung, who is this guy? I'm sorry, this is my younger brother. - Hello! - And this man? - Who? - You! Motorbike taxi. I told you. Just tell me if you guys want to be actors. The crew have prepared for this scene all day long. It costs a lot of money. You guys ruined everything. Now what? Damn, I have no money to pay for this, and you haven't paid me the fare. Uncle, I'm sorry. I didn't know that you were filming. I just wanted to help my brother from many guys attacking him. - Actually... - It's okay. Don't make a big deal over it. It's good that everyone is okay. You two have some guts. I like it. Hey, if you guys need a job, just let me know. Main actor, how about me? He's a producer, not an actor. Uncle, do we continue shooting? Shoot what? My crew is all messed up. Tell everyone to have a lunch break. Let's have lunch, people! I'll get that one. - Ouch! There's plenty of food. - Thank you. Use chopsticks, not your hands. Okay. Yes? - Take as much food as you want. - Hey, how is it back home? Eat well to have the energy for work. Who's taking care of our parents' graves? Are you running away from debt? Only you know me well. Maybe that job is not for me. I dreamt about Mom and Dad last night, and our fifth aunt also told me that it's best for me to come here and learn from you. Let me tell you, this job is not easy at all. Then we must hold on to it, or else we're doomed. Since you're here, please transfer the remaining money. What? I did transfer the rest to you. You can see how much I invest in this movie. Eight billion won't be enough. That's your job. It doesn't make sense not having any stars for such a highly invested movie. I know celebrity factor is important now, but to me, quality is the key. That's why I put my heart and soul into this film. I'm left with nothing if you hang me out to dry like this. I know you're an award-winning director. But all of our recent works have failed, and I'm hesitant to risk it with you again. But the house I pawned for you is up to 15 billion in value. Even if you have it mortgaged at a bank, the price would be the same. But that's my money, where is yours? I'm struggling now, so I will withdraw from this project. Please understand. Mr. Son. Mr. Son! I don't think you have the mood to eat now, right? Let me eat your lunch then. Uncle, health is important. Please try to have some anyway. The most important thing for me now is to finish shooting this movie. Eat up, guys. What is wrong with me? Everywhere I go, things are messed up. Please take a look if you can help him. I'm sorry. I tried my best. It's too rushed to find any sponsors for you. Please understand. I really love your movies, that's why I lend you money for such a low interest rate, only 7%. Wow. I know I'm fat. For others, I would take 11%. Wow. What's with all the "wow"? So? What do you think? Let me consider and call you later. Okay. Please call me soon, or I will increase to 8%. Wow! I hate this guy already. The ball has disappeared, just like magic. No clue where it is. Well... I like you because you have talent and sincerity, but I can't help you guys this time. You know that I have said everything to your director. You keep staying here makes me feel uneasy. Sir. If we have to stop filming, all of Uncle Thuan's efforts will be wasted. Not to mention that many crew members will be unemployed. I'm one of them. It even costs me money to travel back to my hometown. Okay. I will help, but you two have to help me with one thing. Even ten things are okay, sir. I need talented guys like you two to help me to do one important task. If you agree, I promise to continue to invest in this movie. Easy-peasy. Talent is what we have plenty of, sir. I'm sorry. I will give you the answer later. - What? Isn't this an easy decision? - Goodbye. Please wait. Let me discuss this with him. Brother, what's wrong? Why are you thinking hard about such a good deal? Uncle, we can do this ourselves. Why do we need them? You're just a bunch of crap. If I didn't interfere the last time, would you even be standing here and getting envious? Stop that, and give yourself some peace. - What is the emotion in this scene? - It's just an action scene. Come here and listen to me. Everyone, come here and listen to Mr. Thuan! Listen, Hoang, now we will do scene 60C. This is a one-shot scene. Trung, you will perform stunts for Nam in this scene. After I say "action," you will hold Vy's hands and run really fast. The stuntmen will jump down. Remember that the camera is right behind, so you can't look back. After that, you will meet the second stuntmen group and have to fight them to rescue Vy. Remember to act quickly, so when the camera turns to the stuntmen, Nam will appear to replace you. You hold Vy's hand right when the camera turns back. Understand? Uncle, who will I fight against in this scene? No one. Just stand there, then jump down when the actor passes by. Oh, it's too high. Maybe it's safer for me to hang in here and jump down later. - Yeah, that's fine. - Great. Remember, you will only jump when the main actor passes through. - Okay. - Are you sure? Don't worry, I'm professional. I'm smarter than you think. Yeah, good. - Vy. - I know. Hold on to the ladder. Tam, please only take it out when we start to shoot for safety. Okay. Do you remember what Uncle Thuan said? You're working with a professional. Prepare the scene. I'm not ready! The scene is ready. The casts are ready. Prepare the camera. Camera starts. Camera... Wait. - Costumes? - Yes. - What is it, Mr. Tam? - We're professionals, pay more attention. Doesn't the actor wear a black shirt? What? The match cut was like that. Where? - Sorry, I mistook the last scene. - Okay. The scene is ready. The casts are ready. Prepare the camera. Uncle, the makeup doesn't match. Wait, where's the makeup team? - Come and match the makeup, please. - Yes, sir. I'm not Rambo. Oh, my God. Hurry up. Camera starts. Action. Cut! What was that? I told you, just jump down when the actors pass by. I'm sorry. Again. God! Prepare, everyone! Camera! Two, three... Action! What is it? Cut! What happened? - Are you okay? - What's wrong? Why would you do that? This is what you call professional? Professional, my ass. Just quit it already. Do you think you're a pro? Try to hang up there for ten minutes. - How can I do it on an empty stomach? - What are you doing? Stop fighting. Please help me finish this scene, then we'll take a break. I thought making film is a dream job. I didn't know it's this painful. Let me tell you, not only me but the whole crew will pass out. - Okay. - It's true! Enough! I quit! -So unprofessional -Vy. - To whom did you say that? Whom? - Vy. Uncle! Could we let the crew take a short break and then start again? Okay. Break for dumplings, everyone! - Dumplings, guys. - Haven't seen any film crew like this. Make me work like hell, but only serve dumplings. Dumplings were even in my dream. Please show some respect. Please check the costumes carefully. - Yes. - Water. Open it. You're not crippled. Why can't you open it yourself? - Here's your dumpling. - Why only one? Give me two. Okay. Here you go. Uncle, our budget is running out, and we still have many scenes to shoot. What is the point of trying? That's right. If we shoot recklessly and end up with bad scenes, we're screwed. How about we wait until we have enough budget? Listen, everyone! Let's stop shooting for now and wait for further notice. Uncle, don't we really have any other ways? I don't know. I will try to find a way. Hear me out. If we're late, he won't pay us. But Uncle Thuan has no money left to give us. Don't you see he has such a big villa? Be gentle, or it will break. What's happening? Be gentle, Hieu. Give it to me. Honey, what's this? Don't you see they're taking our property? Let me deal with this. I don't know what you have done out there to make people kick us out of the house. That's fine, we'll go. Are you happy? Honey. Rio. Honey. - Let's go, son. - Honey, don't take him away. Hey, don't touch these things! Don't you hear me? Give it to me! Honey! Rio! Honey, listen to me! Let me go! Live with the mess you have left behind! Dad... Uncle. We're a family from now on. We stick together through thick and thin. I want you guys to respect and help each other. Hey, there are plenty of jobs out there, why would you choose to do stunts? Are you crazy? What's wrong with this job? I didn't say it's wrong. You do all the fighting and even get injuries. But when the film is released, the main cast takes all the credits. No one knows about you, right? Why don't you look at yourself? There are plenty of jobs out there, why would you choose to be Mr. Son's servant? He'll take all the credits, and you'll get nothing. I am just like you guys. We only do it temporarily, then we'll quit. God, we ain't like you at all. We do this job because we love it. What? Love it? Why do you laugh? I laughed because I love this job like you do. Bullshit! Love being a servant? What kind of movie needs these trash woods? We need those to make tools. Okay. - This is my brother. - This guy? - You're making a movie? - Yes. If you film around here and need more cast, let me know. - Can you act? - Of course. Chasing, arresting smugglers... I can act really well. That's what I do all the time. It's just a comedy. Oh, comedy? This guy will fit in better. Look, he does have a funny look. Have a safe trip. Thank you. - You promised. Don't forget me, got it? - Got it! Yes? Roger that. - Stop the truck! - What's wrong? Please get out and let us check the truck. I knew it. That guy's face is not funny at all. I need to take a piss anyway. - Oh, God! What's that? - Stop! I'm still down here! Help me! - What are you doing? Go over there. - Ouch! Help! Hey! Thank God. I'm alive. Thank you, ancestors. I will offer you one more pig, so I owe you four pigs in total. This is the best day of my life. Are you messing with me? Why are you so mad? Want to eat me alive? I'm just like you. You should blame my boss. I don't know anything. - Can't we go back another day? - You can leave if you are tired. I think we'll go home empty-handed again, like the last time. This time, I won't go home without the money. Director. - Could I see you for a moment, please? - Do you have an appointment? Do you know who he is? He's the director of Don't sleep before the Dawn. Film directors are no exception. Hello, sir. Do you know that I am a big fan of your movie? - Nice to meet you! - Yeah. - You have guests waiting in the room. - I know. I sob every time I watch your movies. You are such a talented director. You make me cry so much. Thank you. We'll take a picture later and hang it here. Sure. My pleasure. By the way, what can I do for you today? To be honest, I'm working on another movie now. But we have used up our money. So we are looking for some other investors. Can you help me? Sorry, I love to watch movies, but I don't know anything about investing in movies. However, I have a friend who loves the fame. I can introduce you. That's great. - Hi, sorry to keep you waiting. This is... - It's okay. No need, we're like family. Really? I have some emergency. I need to leave now. Wait, let's at least have a drink. Sorry, maybe next time. Uncle? But you said you would not go home without the money. We can celebrate now. Really? Thanh, run. You think you can run away? From me? No, I won't let it go, it's so high up. Don't want to fall down. Pervert! - Those two are dead yet? - Not yet. Not that easy. You guys suck. Take over the wheel. I can take care of the rest. - Congrats on this successful cooperation. - We make such a good pair. Our business runs smoothly every time. Uncle, Trung and his brother have stolen our goods. - What did you say? - I'm sorry. I'll do anything to get it back. You are so full of yourself. I trusted you, and you dared to steal my goods. Thang and his men started it. They tried to kill us. - But where is my truckload now? - We are keeping it. - It was Thang who betrayed you. - I don't care who betrayed me. I just want to know if I can get all the goods. If you don't want any troubles, you'd better bring it back now. Actually, who are the traitors? We'll know when we take back our goods. What if they never deliver it to us? If they don't, I'll hunt them down, no matter what. But I'm afraid the police will get them before you can. Thang is a crazy dude. He dares to steal from Mr. Son. He doesn't want to live anymore. Or are they messing around with us? Perhaps. If we sell the goods, we will make enough money to fund Uncle Thuan's dozens of movies. - What if we don't return it? - Then we're no better than thieves. We'd hide for the rest of our lives. That's right. But if we bring the goods to Mr. Son, will he leave us alone? Should we inform the police? Those two guys are in stuntmen team. Sometimes, we hired them to work on the film set. Other than that, we have no control over them. Now that the crew has stopped filming temporarily. We don't keep track of what they do or where they go. Thanks for your cooperation and sorry for taking your time. We don't know anything. We're just truck drivers. You don't know? You trafficked prohibited goods and fought against officers on-duty, and you say you don't know? You have to stay here for further investigation. No way! It won't work like that. Drop it. The only solution is to give the goods back to Mr. Son. But this truck must have been flagged. We will be arrested right away if we show up on the road. What can we do? I think I have a good idea. The porridge is good huh? We should go back again. - Hey, hey. - What? You guys have not paid yet. What? You charge drivers too? God, two of you didn't bring any customers. If you do this, how can my business survive? - We'll never come back. - Thanks. The porridge was so bad. Where's the owner? We already paid you, why did you take our plate number? How the heck can we keep driving? How about this plate? Keep it as a souvenir. All of the forbidden trophies we have! You dare to come back here? What about my truckload? I'm sorry, uncle. I didn't know they'd planned on stealing it. I'm pretty sure they have no place to go. Trust me. I'll put my life on the line to get it back for you. Your life is less valuable than my dog's. How do you want to handle them? Killing them is very easy, but we will get nothing from it. What is important now is to take back the goods. Remember, don't make me lose face in front of Mr. Tuan. What? Why so cheap? I thought it should be at least 500 to 700. What did you expect? It's already risky for me to buy at that offered price. I'm not sure if it could be sold to anyone, or end up in the scrap store. What do you say? Go somewhere else if you don't wanna sell it. I only take cash. HOUSE FOR SALE I sincerely apologize, we can't finish shooting this movie. I'm sure that you understand the reason why. This is all I can gather for now. I know it's not enough to pay every single one of you, just give me more time, I will pay it all off after selling this house. Tam. Please help me split the payment up evenly for the team. Uncle. Leave it, no need to split anything. I'm sorry. In the past, I was wrong about you. I think... I am the youngest here but I want to say something. Please continue to film, I'll stand by your side. This is all I have to contribute to the crew. Please take it. Uncle, I'm poor, indeed, but if you want to continue, I will be by your side until the end without any payment. For me, I just need to have the food covered. Uncle, we don't have the car anymore, I still can ride my motorbike to work. You won't have the real ones if we die. These fake rhino horns, ivories? Your previous prop team made them and just left them here in my storage. Just take them if you need. Where did you hide my goods? Come here! - I will shoot his brain out, you hear me? - Wait! We will take you to it. You're in no position to give conditions. Only you will lead us. He will stay, and he will lose a finger in every hour until we find the goods. We cooperate and you guys still hit us? Time starts now. Go. It will take one hour to get there. Do I really have to hold chopsticks with only four fingers? Hold him, don't let him move. Don't move! Don't move! Please stop. I'm sweating because of you. Why does it hurt so bad? Are you doing it right? I don't know. I follow internet's instruction. Don't worry. Let me go. A bunch of fools. Try to show off while you know nothing. Who just said that? - What the hell do you know? - I am your master. Freehand tattoo is for professional artist only, others will need printed decals or stencils to trace, you guys don't know anything, so you just draw shit. Not to mention, using the bad ink can even cause skin cancer. Understand? Hey, please tattoo a buffalo for me. Dog tattoo for me, please. I know, you two will make good pets. - Tattoo a goat for me, please. - I can tell from your face. All right, I will tattoo anything you like. It's not fair I'm sitting last. What now? Let's change formation. If you guys want to be badasses, you have to suffer pain. Don't be weak, understand? Yes, sir. Dog for you. Goat for you. Hey, you are a hot shot now. Stop, Stop. Don't let him run away. Load them in. - Hello? - I'm out. Don't lead them to the goods. They will kill us afterwards. - Where are you now? - I'm at the flower garden. See you. Oh God, why am I having a cramp now? Can't even stand up. Ouch. Hey, the younger one has run away. Brother. Brother. Only ivories are here. No sight of the rhino horns. Is it the right place? Just go. Oh my God! You son of a bitch! I'm scared of ghosts. You're scared of ghosts? If we let him run away now, our bodies will be buried here tomorrow. What should we do now? Let's line up. - Yeah. - You first. I'm not gonna go first. So scary. I'm sorry, I didn't know. LE THI THU YET MAI - Where is he? Is he here? - Come out please. Please come out. Oh my God. Why is there no one here? -Listen to me -Why is it so silent here? - Like a graveyard. - we have to stick together. I'm not responsible if you go by yourself and get caught, remember my words! Why is it so silent here? - Where is he? - I don't hear anyone breathing. He really knows where to hide. Stop! Why do you stop? I told you to stick together, who is running around? What? We're all here, no one is running around. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Take attendance. - One. - Two. - Three. Four. Five. You're wrong, I should be number four. Count again. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Now we're right. But I think there's still something wrong. Why did you say "wrong" so many times? You still have mood to make jokes? No, I'm just... What? You're talking to me and you look somewhere else? Something's not right? Ghost! What's the fuss now? I can't even have peace laying here. It... was them who made the noise, not me. You like it here? No, I'm still young with a future ahead of me. I haven't had a wife and kids. Life is still beautiful for me. Beautiful? I don't think you can even get out of here. I know. Please let me go, don't haunt me, I'm scared of ghost. I didn't haunt you. Then why do you keep flying in front of me? Fly what? You liar! It's you who keep dragging my mat. Hey, what are you doing? - What are you doing? - This is real? What do you bring your mat here for? This is my wife's grave. Many years ago, we went together for a photoshoot. Hey, ready, cheer up, cheer up. That's great. Step more to the right, to the right. That's nice. To the left. That's nice, left. Cheer up, brother. Could you step back a little bit? Okay, your Ao Dai is flying so beautifully. No, no, back up a little more. That's right. Ready, two, three. That's the story. The only memory I had with her is this. When she hadn't fallen down the cliff? Poor her for passing away at such young age. Screw the photographer! He could have stepped back himself but he asked us to do so. That's why she had to die young. You see. My head was even cut off. That's right. Even her legs. I'm sorry. For many years, I've slept here to talk to her as I'm afraid she might feel lonely. I know how you feel. How about I sleep here with you tonight? Be my guest. I will ask her to share this space with you. We didn't have guest for so long, she should be very happy. Don't worry. Then I should go. Goodbye. Hey! Yes? On the way out, if you see someone, just say hi, they won't harm you. I can neither stay nor leave. How about you walk me out of here? How coward of you! When I was alive, I was very brave. - Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. - Hey boy. I was just kidding, why is he so scared? Your whole gang couldn't even deal with these two guys. Do you know how much those ivories and rhino horns are worth of? Now they're lost. How will you make it up to me? You think only you who endure the loss? Do you know how much I invested to work with you? Now, you and I are both screwed. We never thought that they could do that. We were very lucky to make it back here. Rhino horn is just like buffalo or cow horn, fingernail or toenail. But many people pay billions to use them for treatment. You're right. If it is that powerful, we can just bite our fingernails instead and save money. But not everyone can think like you. If they can, we didn't have to experience so many terrible things. Why is your experience so similar to the story of our current movie? Even worse than movies. I almost lost the chance to go home and fix my fifth aunt's face. - Open the door. - This is their house. Oh my God. It's them. Open the door. - Break it. - Break the door. Hurry up! - Search. - Got it. What is it so hard? - They used the spoon to lock the door. - Are they inside? - They're not outside either. - Go upstairs. Destroy everything! Ladies and gentlemen, the starting price for this painting is 50 million. Is there anyone want to buy it to raise the charity fund? - 100 million. - I pay 150 million. - 300 million. - A gentleman offered 300 million. Does anyone want to offer more? I pay one billion. One billion? Thank you so much! On behalf of the charity fund, thank you. I think not only me, but everyone wants to do this. You're welcome. Just invite me if you have any other meaningful events. I really like the way you do business. You must be very successful. I just have a small business. It's our honor to work with you in the future. I love antiques, ivories or rhino horns, for instance. What a shame! But I believe we can meet again soon. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I have what you need. Good ones. I really like your fast working style. Congratulations for this successful business. I told you we would meet again soon. These are just half of what I've got. I still have another special batch, and I will sell it to you if you need it. What else do you have? Rhino horns. You will never have the second batch. I never thought you could do this to me. I was lucky to have them help me. If you care about your truckload, we're the one to ask. You just need to follow our plan, we will help you to get it back. Put one of your man in the auction. We will help you with the rest. Thank you. Thanks for gathering all of them here for me. We outnumber them by four men. Bullying me is not that easy. You only see the tip of the iceberg. Good job. You. - Wait. - Run. Uncle, run. - Take them alive. - Run. Uncle, run. - Give me. Run first. - Follow me, uncle. Gotta kill them. Hit him. - Help me, Uncle Thuan. - You think I'm weak? This way, Uncle Thuan. Run. Come on, catch them! All of you, get him. Brother! This way. Hurry up! Hurry up! Where is he? Come on, find him. Quickly! You go that way. Split up! Look carefully. - Where is Uncle Thuan? - I don't know. Gosh! If I don't get what I want, you can come here and take his corpse home. This feels so familiar. You come here and open it. - What? - Damn you! The longer we wait, the more valuable the treasure becomes. That's right. I also have waited so long for this day. But I am the one who deserves this treasure the most. You're surrounded. Don't move. Don't move. Don't move. Put your hands up. Put your hands up. I surrender. I will testify in the court. Everything has its own time limits. I can wait. But not the time bomb. Defuse it now! You're angry again. Relax. Defuse it! It's not that simple. I have set it all up. It will self-destruct after my men and I get out of here. Now, do you believe me or do you want everyone to die? This is not a studio. This time bomb is not a prop. Run! I have texted the address, please come quickly. Fake cops. Attack! Why do you treat me like this? Attention, everyone! This is real, we are not filming. Follow me. Stop! Fight against me if you have guts. Stop! God, help me! Too many of them! Help me! Why are they so crowded? Attack them. Ouch, that hurts. - What? Just a prop? - This one is real. Die! Die! Tam. Protect Uncle... Thuan. Tam, you have to live. You can't die like this, Tam. It's my honor to be friends with you. My God! Fake knife, bitch. Wake up and fight! Why am I stuck with him again? It hurts. You broke my hand. Uncle Thuan. You go, we'll take care of them. Uncle Thuan. Freeze! Everybody, freeze! Put the weapons down! - Everybody, freeze! - Fake cops. Attack! Oh my God. They're real. If anyone resists, I will shoot. Put your weapon down. Raise your hands up. Why are you so late? Send the right address next time. This is a warehouse, not a restaurant. I always text the wrong address, that's why we're always behind schedule. Be careful. Trung, be careful. Stop! You die! Thanh, Thanh! Help me, help me. Uncle Thuan! Uncle Thuan! Uncle Thuan! Uncle Thuan! Uncle Thuan! Call the ambulance. Uncle Thuan! It's too late. Uncle Thuan. It's too late. I'm sorry. I'm sorry to get you involved. I have to thank you for everything you've done for me and the crew. From now on, I cannot be at the studio with you and the team. - Uncle! - I just regret not being able to finish the film. I... I wish the film... would be introduced... to the audience some days. Uncle Thuan! Uncle Thuan. Get them! Get them! You two, stop! Vy, Vy! Vy! - What is it? - You have nowhere to run now. You thought you could run away from us? Come on, let's go there. Hurry up! - Come on. - Let's go! Hurry Up! They're running away. Are you okay? We're okay. Where there are good people, there will be bad people. But don't worry. There are plenty of good ones behind the bad ones. Life is a long journey. Get up and go! FACE OFF 2 On behalf of the film director, the producer, I would like to thank everyone, especially the film crew, who supported to help the film to be rolled out today. Uncle Thuan's wish has finally come true. I hope the film will be enjoyed by everyone. Yeah! - It's for you. - This is for you. I miss you so much. - Oh, it hurts. - Oh, I forgot. Thank you. I'm okay. I will be back to the studio soon. It's a bomb! Get down, everyone! Come here. Why are you so fast? Mom, a teddy bear, it's so cute. Mom, this teddy bear is so cute. Can I bring it home? Get out of the way! Get out of the way! It is so cute. Mom, why did he take away my teddy bear? What is it? Why so serious? This is just the beginning.
