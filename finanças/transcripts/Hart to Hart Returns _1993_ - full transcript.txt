NARRATOR: This is my boss Jonathan Hart. He's a millionaire, self-made. And this is his wife Jennifer. She's quite a lady. Oh, and that's me. My name is Max. I take care of them, which ain't easy, cause when they met, it was murder. SIMULATOR VOICE: Valentine, this is Delta One Control, -change spot 0129. JONATHAN HART: Roger. SIMULATOR VOICE: Valentine, enemy target, 12 o'clock, three miles opposite direction, descending your altitude. Prepare to engage. Valentine, collision alert. Repeat, collision alert. JONATHAN HART: Copy. Delta Two Hunter. Confirm heading 120. SIMULATOR VOICE: Valentine, Delta One, be advised, enemy target maneuvering to your heading with speed. BILL MCDOWELL: Delta Two, Hunter, I have visual. JONATHAN HART: Delta One, Valentine, bogie moving on my six. SIMULATOR VOICE: Valentine, Delta One, turn right heading 300. ♪♪♪ Delta One, this is Valentine, are you still there? I'm coming out of here. SIMULATOR VOICE: Roger, Valentine, go to AV, clear to flight level 210, maneuvering. ♪♪♪ JONATHAN HART: Delta One, Valentine, I can't shake him. [ALARM BEEPING] BILL MCDOWELL: Draining fuel fast, please advise. JONATHAN HART: Please advise? That's easy, pal. You die. Delta One, I'm going to head for the hard deck. SIMULATOR VOICE: Roger, Valentine, cleared for the deck. ♪♪♪ BILL MCDOWELL: Okay, Valentine, Galileo, Magna Carta and you. What have they got in common? The answer to the question is...

SIMULATOR VOICE: Thank you, gentleman, your simulator drill is concluded. -Nice shooting, Mr McDowell. -Thank you, Rene. Aw, cheer up, old buddy, you never could out-maneuver me. [LAUGHS] But I must say you died a heroic death, we'll all remember you fondly. Thanks a lot. It really is too bad Jennifer couldn't come along. Does she fly? That's cute. She's busy writing a story, but she did say to send you her love. Yeah, if I'd known you'd be the only thing I'd get a look at, I never would have extended the invitation. -Really? -Yeah. Come on, let's get out of this stuff, I'll give you the grand tour. 122 mil, just to build that one section. Not bad, huh? You and me, we're from the same mold. We did things the way we flew, by the seat of our pants. Hart Industries, McDowell Aviation. The name. The name was what counted. -It still does, Bill. -Yeah, yeah, I know. But everything's different now. They do things by committee. There are no born barnstormers like us, Valentine. We're the last of a breed. Now, I've brought McDowell Aviation to the brink of the next century. The question is, what do we do next? How about lunch? Okay, alright. I'll shut up, we'll eat. -Hey, I'm buying. -Okay. ♪♪♪ MAX: Come on, boy, that's it, come to Max. Come. That's it, bring me the paper. Well, how about fetch? Fetch me the paper. That's it. Fetch.

Would you please tell him that his wife called. -Again. FEMALE OVER TELEPHONE: Certainly. Thank you. Three-way Julia, you lousy mutt, give me those papers. Your old man would be ashamed if he was alive to see this. Max? Mrs. H, he's got to be stopped, he steals all my important papers and chews them up. Max, if Jonathan calls, would you tell him I won't be home until after dinner? -You missed him? -For the third time today. Been missing each other a lot lately. I know. Believe me, it's not out of choice. Is this your valuable paper? "Sammy's Dream in the fourth." Sammy's Dream? -That's his pick. -Oh, really? Well, for your sake, I wish you a lot of luck. Max? How's everything? Yeah, fine here. -Where's Jennifer? -You just missed her. She's out doing a story on that doctor fella. Oh, damn. All right, tell her I'll call her tonight. Mr H, you know that saying about absence making the heart grow fonder? Yeah. I was thinking, maybe it's true. But sometimes a little of the real thing goes a long way. Call Pierro at Valentino's, have him fix up a nice dinner, and Max, thanks for the tip, I owe you one. -Everything okay? -Yeah, I guess. We keep missing each other's phone calls. -Gets a little frustrating. -Yeah. Hey, this is a nice piece. Lakota, it's a talking stick. Found it back in the caves up in Mount Bedford. It's an old Indian custom. Whichever tribe member has the stick does the talking. When he's through, he passes it to the next Indian. Without the stick, nobody says a word. Good system, maybe I should use it at my next board meeting. LISA: Lunch is ready, gentlemen. Salad, cold, poached white meat of chicken, julienne fresh vegetables, bottled water, most of it. What happened to the pastrami sandwiches? Enjoy your lunch, Mr McDowell. -Mr Hart. -Thanks, Lisa. Unfortunately, she's very efficient, -and she takes good care of me. -Yeah, so I see. -Mr McDowell? -Yeah? Your son's in the outer office, he'd like to say hi to Mr Hart. -Oh, great. -Yeah, well have him come in. -Hey, Peter. -Jonathan. -How are you? -Good to see you. How you doing? -How's the family? -Great, thanks, thanks. Billy wears that Dodger cap you sent him like day and night, it's like he sleeps in it. So, how was the dog fight? It was unbelievable. I've done my share of flying, but nothing quite like that. Well, it's all in the software. Six years of programming to develop it. You hear that, Jonathan, all in the software. What about the pilot? I blew him out of the sky. I'll print you out a hard copy, and you can take it home. Great idea, Peter, maybe next time it'll help him win. Dad? You want to come down and check the lab. I've been making some real progress with that thermal imaging idea. Maybe later, huh, Peter? Me and Valentine here, we've got some catching up to do. No, hurry. -Well, I'll see you, huh? -Yeah. -Good to see you, Jonathan. -See you. -Okay. Start talking. -What do you mean? You didn't ask me up here just to beat me flying in that simulator. Talking about flying, TJ, now he was a pilot. He could fly circles around me. He was 28 when this was taken. Sit down, Jonathan. Valentine, I got a proposition for you. I'm listening. I want you to buy McDowell Aviation. -You're kidding. -No, not at all. You've been after it for years, so now it's available. Why now? BILL MCDOWELL: Defense contracts have all dried up. Now is the time to change McDowell Aviation out of the defense business into peace time. It's now or never. Why me? Because if it isn't you, it'll be somebody else. Jonathan, I've worked too hard to see this torn apart. I want it to continue, but I want it in the hands of someone I can trust. How about Peter? How do you think he'll feel about all of this? You know him Jonathan, he's not like his brother. TJ, now, TJ, he had the instincts, you know? Peter, he lives in the lab with the computers. Hell, he'd be fish food in five minutes with the barracudas in this game. It's sudden, Bill, I'll... have to think about it, talk to my people. BILL MCDOWELL: Hey, great, that's fine. Now I'm going to be gone for a couple of weeks, I'm going up to a dig near Mount Bedford. Matter of fact, it's right near that little lake where we went fishing a couple of years ago. I want to see if I can find more pieces like that talking stick. You do your thing, have your guys check us out, make a decision. When I get back, we'll shake on it, one way or the other. There's one other thing. This idea is strictly between you and me, okay? What do you say? -I'll think about it. -Fair enough. We got a problem here. Why don't we go downtown tonight? There's a new place, just opened up. There's always some interesting action. -Just you and me? -I'll take a rain-check. -Come on, you and me. -Rain-check. [LAUGHS] All these years trying to whip each other, who could fly faster, build bigger, there was always one thing I could never match you at. One gun test you won hands down a long time ago.

Not me, them. They're out there in places not even on the map, fighting diseases that don't have names yet. And they don't have to. They want to. Rather like you, I'd say. -Me? -Sure.

Defense department, the SCC, Hart's attorneys. And all your kickbacks, all your over-billing on government contracts and all your sales to unsanctioned buyers will become very, very public knowledge. General, you're the damn Pentagon, what do you suggest? I'd like to give Jonathan Hart something else to think about. Something that has nothing to do with buying McDowell Aviation. Just long enough to close out the deals we started, shut down the operation, disappear, and after that, who cares? Well, that's great, but he's already started looking at the company. How do you propose we do it? Never meet the enemy head on if you can defeat them before you even reach the battlefield. You discredit Jonathan Hart with his own troops. Get him in enough trouble at home, he won't have time to look at the McDowell operation. I'll get you everything you need. Bank numbers, phone logs, IRS documents, fingerprints taken while he was in the service. As you say, I'm the damn Pentagon. [DOORBELL RINGS] MAX: Mrs H, would you get that? I'm on the phone. But...

I believe it has potential. I mean, for what, I'm afraid to think. I mean, if I do make it work, then it goes down the hall and... McDowell Industries will see to it that any potential for death and destruction is not overlooked. Well, not necessarily. It's your work. Why don't you decide how they're going to use it?

Something about vaccine, it fell into the wrong hands and people were dying. It was Aspel and Markowitz that defended Ehrlich at the trial.

You and Firman were college buddies. If you asked him, he'd probably kill the story. If I'm wrong, just tell me and I'll leave. We were once the... most highly respected team of doctors in America. In the years we ran World Team Medical, Paul Menard and I were on the cover of Time magazine three times.

He had no known relatives and yours is the last number he called. What happened? Our office received a call, Hayden said he had some very sensitive information he wanted to turn over to us as quickly as possible. He sounded very frightened. And when we got there, we found him with a bullet in his head. Now what was he doing for you? -Research. -What kind of research? I know, and you must know, I don't have to answer that kind of a question. Maybe you'd better rethink that, Mr Hart. You could be in a lot of trouble. -It was Eric. -Oh, dear. I'm not being arrested yet, but they're licking their chops in there. Someone's trying very hard to make me look guilty. -Where's Lou? -He's on the phone. Ted Avery wants a meeting of the board. -When? -Now. -Research. -Peter? Jonathan Hart. -Hi. -I'm trying to find your dad. -Is he still there? -No, you just missed him. He left this afternoon for the mountains. Anything I can do? JONATHAN HART: The FBI has information only your dad and I could know about. I think someone has bugged his office. Do you know anything about a company health plan involving smokers and non-smokers? A health plan? Smokers and non-smokers? -It doesn't ring a bell, huh? - No. If you want to know anything more, you'll have to wait till he gets back and ask him. Thanks very much. Bye. TED AVERY: Jonathan, we're sorry we had to call you down here in the middle of the night. Jennifer, you are a member of the board, but this is an executive committee meeting and it may be rather awkward. It's not awkward for me, Ted. I'm here as Mrs Jonathan Hart. If that's a problem for anybody, just say so. I assume you've seen these files we received from authorities. We haven't had a chance to study them thoroughly, Ted. I've seen them. Are all those signatures yours? None of them are mine. So you're saying that they're forged? Yes. You do realize that they show offshore bank accounts into which you supposedly shuttled hundreds of millions of dollars of Hart Industry funds. Where did you get those files, Ted? According to the authorities, they were found in Eric Hayden's house. Well, doesn't that tell you something? Do you really think that if Jonathan had anything to hide, he'd allow files to be left out for somebody to find? This man Hayden was murdered, Jonathan, the FBI thinks these files gave you a motive for wanting him dead. Do you think we have a right to know what this is all about? Obviously, someone is trying to discredit me. I don't know why. -Did you hire Eric Hayden? -Yes, I did. I asked him to look into a company called McDowell Aviation as a possible acquisition. Why someone on the outside? Why not one of our own researchers? And why didn't you tell us anything about it? He doesn't have to report to the board every time he gets an idea, Ted. These files suggest that you used Hayden as a conduit to launder hundreds of millions of dollars of Hart Industry funds. There's no mention of McDowell Aviation in any of them. -How do you explain that? -I can only guess. Someone wanted my attention away from McDowell Aviation. Jonathan, what if the authorities file charges against you? Now something like this, once it hits the papers, even if it isn't true, can have a devastating effect on the value of Hart Industries, and we have a responsibility to our shareholders. 48 hours. If I can't unravel what this is all about by then, you do what you have to for the company. I'll go along. All right. 48 hours. After that, we really don't have any choice, and you'll have to be removed from your position as CEO of Hart Industries until such time as this whole matter is resolved. JONATHAN HART: Bill is the only one that can sort this out. JENNIFER HART: We have to find him. It is obviously an attempt to discredit you. -It cannot possibly hold up. JONATHAN HART: It doesn't have to hold up. You know the story about a man's reputation, it's like a rollercoaster, it goes up slowly, comes down fast. I used to sell papers right around the corner from here. -You did? -Yeah. One day I had a chance for a better job, and Max came around the corner, pulled up right alongside of the news stand and handed me a new sport coat. All I had was a ratty old baseball jacket, that's the only thing I owned. So I look at this gorgeous sports coat, and I look at Max, and he says, "Here, kid, take it. Someday the name Jonathan Hart may mean something, but right now, you gotta make them believe." Jonathan. -Yeah, come on, get in. -Jonathan? Can't you read? Move it. I'd better talk to Max, see if he's still got that sports coat. ♪♪♪ Oh, look, he waited up for us. We should have called. Max? Mr and Mrs H, where have you been? Here, I want to show you something. -Where'd you get this? -Duke, my bookie. His brother-in-law works for the arson squad. I asked for a look before they issued it officially. What does it say, darling? It says the night the house was burned, -there were signs of burglary. -Burglary? I went back in the house, they found a lighter, they got prints off it but no match yet. Good work, Max. But what were they looking for? -Information. -Information about what? Well, let's start at the beginning. Bill McDowell offers to sell me his company. Right after that, when I get back, someone breaks into our house and sets fire to it. Maybe someone at McDowell knew that Bill wanted you to buy the company and they didn't want that to happen. And they knew that I hired Eric Hayden about some project labelled smokers and non-smokers. JENNIFER HART: He was too close for comfort, and if you bought the company, it would only get worse. So they kill him and they leave evidence accusing me of stealing from Hart Industries. Tying your hands so that you couldn't buy McDowell even if you wanted to. Pack your bags, darling, we're headed for Seattle. Just like old times. ♪♪♪ Peter said that Bill always camps up in the north and then works his way down. Well, that part's a little tricky. I was up there once. I still can't help but think that we're missing something. Like the pieces of a puzzle. The only thing you came back from Seattle with was that computer readout, right? Do you think that was important enough to burn our house down? Well, it's the only thing I had in the house that had anything to do with McDowell. No, we're missing something. I can feel it in my bones. Well, it'll all come together when we find Bill. [GUNSHOT] ♪♪♪ [GUNSHOT] What was that? -Oh, nice driving. -Thanks. Hey, there's an old gas station down there. Feel like taking a hike? ♪♪♪ You folks want a cold drink or something? Could be a long wait. Just to change two tires? Well, that wouldn't take long at all. If we had any tires to replace them with. Don't get much business around here anymore. Not since the new highway went in. Well, why didn't you tell us this before? -Darling. -Did you... Darling, there's an airstrip near Bill's campsite. How much to charter that plane? -Charter? Who's going to fly it? -Me. -You got a license? -Not on me, but I can fly it. I don't know, it ain't been up too much lately. -Big insurance risk. -I'll give you $500 upfront. Enjoy your flight. I'll get my purse. ♪♪♪ Everything all right? -First thing they teach you in pilot training? -What's that? Never fly a plane if the parts come off in your hand. ♪♪♪ We'll take a boat across the lake. [JENNIFER COUGHING] ♪♪♪ Great. Now what? What else could possibly go wrong? I'll give you either/or. Either we had a couple of blow outs within a matter of a few seconds. Or someone is trying to keep us away from Bill. That's not very funny. [LOUD BLAST] ♪♪♪ Bill! Bill? Bill! -Hey, Bill. -Bill! Bill? ♪♪♪ TONY: Bartlett, it's done. That is very good news, Tony, now get out of there before anybody sees you. Well, the old pilot has been grounded. What are the chances of having two blowouts within a few seconds and four brand new tires? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Roger that, Dom. No luck in there, is there? -He's not talking. -I didn't think he would. -What are their chances? -I'm afraid not very good. I'm sorry, Mr Hart. But he could still be there alive? Yes, he could be in there anywhere. Those caves go on forever. But if he is alive, we'd have to get to him in the next few hours. But there's just no way to locate his position. Maybe there is. -I'll need a phone. -Got one right here. -[SIREN WAILING] -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Research. - Peter? Jonathan. We found your father. But he's in trouble. We need your help. There's been a cave in up here at Mount Bedford. Your dad is trapped inside. We're not even sure he's still alive. Ah, W-what can I do? I want you to use your equipment to hook into a satellite feed. Jonathan, wait a minute. Hart Industries uses the GRS satellites in search of natural resources. They're waiting to patch you in. This is all experimental. I mean, I'm not sure it'll work. Well, you're about to find out. I'm in. Geocentric resource satellite. 1423997. Now the satellite should distinguish varying degrees of heat inside the mountain. [KEYBOARD CLANKING] I'm getting thermal images now. I'm getting something. Wait. Let me see if I can resolve it. ♪♪♪ Is that him? My God, I can't tell if he's alive or not. Give me the coordinates. Got a pencil? ♪♪♪ I'm supposed to go by this? You got a better idea? How's that working? That's good, just take him down. Mind yourself down there. ♪♪♪ Fourteen feet. Bring her up, how's that looking? Haul it up, pick it up slow. All right. ♪♪♪ We got it. Up. Yes. Yeah! [CHEERING] Oh, great! All right! Valentine? You got a cigar, huh? [TELEPHONE RINGS] -Yeah. - Hello, Peter? Peter, it's Jennifer Hart. They've got him. Thank God. -Help us here. -One, two, three. Everything okay? -Okay, clear. -Okay. Jonathan's talking with him right now. He seems to be okay. Thank you. And thank Jonathan for me. No, you're the one who deserves the thanks. I hope you feel better than you look. From now on, it's strictly golf. Do you mind giving me a few minutes alone with my friend? Thanks. This cave in was no accident, Jonathan. What the hell's going on? Someone in your company heard you and me talking about future plans. And they went to great lengths to stop that from happening. -How'd they hear? -Bugged your office. What? They gave new meaning to the word "Indian talking stick". You were talking, they were listening. I'm running out of time, Bill. I need your help. Someone's trying to discredit me, they'll go to any length to stop me from buying McDowell. Tell me, you know anything about smokers and non-smokers? They're code names. Heat seeking missile guidance device. Long and short range. It would be the biggest contract we ever had, but the Defense Department cancelled about eight months ago. It's old news. Who else on the project knew about the codes? Could have been anybody. -A lot of people knew. -Bill. Suppose someone planned to sell those devices after the contracts were cancelled. They'd have to sell to hostile countries. They call that treason. Well, they'd sure make a fortune. So, Jonathan, I'm really sorry. When I suggested you buy the company, I had no idea it would lead to this. I'll come see you in the hospital. You'll have plenty of time to think while you're there. Think? About what? About how we were able to locate you in the mountains. She'll tell you about it on the way down the hill. -How is he? -He's going to be all right. -Did you find out anything? -Not enough. [DIALS, RINGS] I'll bet it's for you. -Jonathan Hart. - Jonathan, I owe you one. I may be able to pay you back right now. I traced the bug in dad's office. I know where it leads. I'll call you when I get back. You know, you were right. I think we have rediscovered something since we started all of this. -It's nice, isn't it? -Yep. I think it's time to introduce the widow. The widow? The widow. Don't tell me you've forgotten. Oh! Introduce the widow. Jonathan, we haven't done that in a long time. -Think you're up for it? -Why not? She's in Mr McDowell's office and she's refusing to leave. She's demanding to see you and Mr Slocum right away. -She gives you a name? -No. Ma'am, you wanted to see us? Oh, yes, now which one of you is which? I'm Doug Slocum, this is Hal Bartlett. And you are? Me? Little old me. Well, I thought you'd know. I'm Mrs Eric Hayden. Well, please sit down, Mrs Hayden, is it? No, thank you, I think I'll stand. Since my husband was killed, I thought maybe you could help me sort out his accounts. I'm sorry, there must be some mistake. -We've never met your husband. -No? Well, I won't keep you any longer then. I'll just take those files to the proper authorities. Which files? Oh, the files my husband gave me before he died. But that shouldn't mean anything to you. As you said, you didn't even know him. This is a wonderful collection. Come on fish, bite. Does either one of you, gentlemen, have a cigarette? -Uhm, no. -No? Well, I suppose there are smokers and non-smokers. I am a smoker, but it's so bad for you, I suppose that I should become a non-smoker, you know what I mean? I don't know what you're talking about, Mrs Hayden. I'm really very sorry. I believe you are. My husband was murdered, Mr Bartlett. He was murdered because of what was in those files. Someone even tried to use him to frame Jonathan Hart. But I suppose that doesn't mean anything to either one of you. I'm sorry. I wish we could help you. Well, maybe you can. That's why I came here. I'm just a poor little old widow now. What am I supposed to do? Very good, Jennifer, don't get carried away. Is there anything else, Mrs Hayden? No, I suppose not. Well, again, we are terribly sorry about your loss. I wish there was something we could have done for you. Good day, Mrs Hayden. Well, thank you for your time, gentlemen. Whoops. What the hell was that all about? Jonathan. I don't know, but we'd better find out. All right, make a call, have her tailed the minute she leaves the building. Make sure somebody gets those files. Darling, I'm sorry, I couldn't get anything from them. -Maybe I've just lost my touch. -Listen. You didn't lose your touch. You were great. Cancel that. I think it's a good idea if Mrs Hayden joins her husband. That's a lot of killing, Hal. First Hayden, then Bill, now this woman? Them or us, Doug. Them or us. We don't have a choice here. FBI, you're under arrest. Uh-oh, you're on Candid Camera. What was that you thought you lost? Thank you very much. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hart residence. Hey, Mr H. Everything okay? Yeah, fine, Max, we'll be home this afternoon. Great. And I've decided what to give Jennifer for our anniversary. A diamond. A diamond? That's it? Look, Mr H, I'm not one to give advice, but... I want you to take care of a few things. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Got it, Mr H. You can count on me. Nurse, get back here with that cigar. I promise I won't inhale. Oh, I see you're cooperating as usual. Get back to bed, come on. Those damn bureaucrats, they don't let you do anything around here. -Hello, Bill. -Ah, Jennifer. Hi, Jonathan. Hey, why aren't you back at the lab working? What? Do you think it's easy running a company like McDowell Aviation? You got a lot to learn, kid. -Are you sure about this? -Don't argue with me, I'm still your boss. At least for a while. What do you say, Peter? Hold it. Aren't you two forgetting something? Marriage of technologies, taking McDowell Aviation from defense contracting -back into peace time? -Now wait a minute. You're not backing out on me, are you? Hell, Bill, I've got all of this on tape. Well, wait a minute. You'll hear from my people in a couple of weeks. The way I figure it, Hart Industries has got a new partner. Wait a minute, I still got something to say about this. Get over here. Thanks, old buddy. You sure won this dog fight. Jennifer, it's not too late to leave this... Wait a minute. Darling. Bye, Bill. Bye, beautiful. -Partner? -You got it. Darling, why can't you tell me where we're going? Humor me. Can't you at least tell me what I'm supposed to wear? Something beautiful. Well, you always look beautiful. Is it formal? -Very? -Very formal. Very. Ooh. Mr and Mrs H, what do you think? This looks great, Max. I brought in everything I could to make you feel like it's your place. Our place, Max. Yeah, our place. -It's perfect. -Not quite. Not quite? Now it's perfect. The old vase. The old vase. Why do I feel I'm in a Japanese monster movie? -The vase that wouldn't die. -[DOORBELL RINGS] I'll get it. Jonathan, I hope I'm not disturbing anything. Oh, not at all, come in. Jennifer, you have a visitor. -Lovely home. -Thanks, but it's not ours. Yes, that's right, of course, I'm sorry. Well, what a surprise, how did you ever find us? Actually, I got your new address from Marcia, I just wanted to say goodbye. I'm off to South America. We're starting up a new World Team Medical unit there. Wonderful. Well, good luck. You know, your article was a big help to us in raising funds. I just wanted to thank you again for what you did for us. Well, as you said, they're wonderful people doing important work. Oh, I see you've got yourself a new briefcase. I like this better than that black one. It's more you. Oh, where did you say you were going again? South America, the mountains of Peru. Goodness, it must be sort of out of touch there, huh? -You get used to it. -I'm sure you do. I guess you've seen just about every part of the world there is now. East Africa, Bangkok... It goes with the territory. Jonathan, take care of her, she's a fantastic woman. Darling, that's no way to treat a guest. Do you want to know who burned down our beautiful house? Him? I didn't have a briefcase when I went to interview him. How did he know I bought a new one? -Jennifer-- -Remember when I said I thought there was something missing? -Yes. -Well, supposedly all my photographs burned in the fire, right? -Right. -Wrong. -He took them. -He did? All those old photographs I'd dug out. I had them in my old briefcase on the desk. I remember when I first showed him those photographs, there was something that spooked him. I didn't think very much of it at the time, but now I'm absolutely sure I know what it was. What was it? One of those photographs placed him in East Africa at the exact time he swore he was in Bangkok. During the trial. So he lied and his partner Walter Ehrlich took the blame -and he went to prison? -Exactly. Jennifer, I don't want to be negative, but what if you're wrong? Well, at least I got rid of this. I say that his fingerprints will match with the fingerprints found at the fire. Wanna bet? Against you? No way. Max. Oh, boy. Call the police. Just like old times. Max, this is silly, why won't you tell me where we are? I know this has something to do with our anniversary. Darling I wanted to give you the biggest diamond I could find. Happy anniversary. I love you. ♪♪♪ Oh, Jonathan. -I love you. -You do? Do it again. -Again? -Please. Max. Darling, I wanted to give you the biggest diamond I could find. Happy anniversary. I love you.
