Wow! Is it your song? Yes. It's bored me already. - I hate that song. - I hate you. Hi. Ugh! Why? Why, why, why? Bye, mom. Can you tell me what I did wrong in life? - In life in general? - What happened yesterday? - Yesterday? - Yes, yesterday. Nothing. My car must have gone out by itself and came back crashed. It wasn't me. Can you tell me what I did wrong for my own daughter to olympically ignore me and lie to her own mother? It wasn't your own daughter, own mother. It was the own Johana. Remember, the own friend of your own daughter? When you do that, I feel you want me dead. That's never gonna happen, own mother. Stop it! What happened? I had been drinking and couldn't drive. And Johana had been drinking too, but she could drive! So I didn't lie. I didn't crash it. It was her. Daniela, you're spitting on me! I'm sorry. I'm just nervous because I now think my own mother is mad at me and won't lend me the own car. - Can I borrow it? - Do you know what I think? Can you tell me tomorrow what you think? I'm in a hurry. Get out of here! - With or without the car? - As you wish! Dammit! Don't horn! Well, hurry up! Damn! Is this from yesterday? Hello. Oops! - So... to go, right? - Yes, please. And there it was, in my face. - The old man's cock? - The old man's cock. It's your fault for getting in those chats, come on! I just like practicing with an audience, sometimes. - I could be your audience. - You don't want to be my audience. Believe me. Life cursed me with lots of love for music and zero talent to create it. That's why I won't study. Go to college with me. Let's chase the dream together! The dream of studying Accounting? No, thank you. Who should ask for the keys? You or me? Follow my lead. We rather make a fuzz than facing it straight on, OK... Hello and good morning. Good afternoon, you mean. I'd like a... - How's the Moroccan soja latte? - It's good. OK, OK, OK... And the Guatemaltecan blend? It's also good. - Is it "fair trade"? - What do you mean? Fair trade, meaning they treat the bean pickers nicely, etcetera... Well, as I told you last week, I'm not involved in bean picking. Well, for us, it's super important to know what it is we are consuming. Super, super important. Last week I also told you that if you need the bathroom key, you just need to ask for it. See? I told you. - Here it is, OK? - Thank you. - Excuse me, do you like baby whales? - Mmm... yes. Did you know that each year more than 500 baby whales die only in the Gulf of Mexico? Of course not! What do you know? Hi. If you could go back in time and lose your virginity again, with whom would it be? Easy, with Hulk Hogan. Ugh, Johana! What? He's got something! I've been awed by him since I was a little girl, haven't you? - No, I haven't! - Hulkamania! What about you? Me? I'm saving myself for him. Gabo Gabeau... I know... Hey, tonight after the concert I'll offer him my flower. Your flower? Yes... OK. First, don't call it "your flower" again, please, and second, it's very odd having to explain to you that you're not a virgin, Daniela. - I'm super virgin. - What about Beto? Beto was my first time. It doesn't count. Right... That makes total sense, obviously! And the dude from Puebla? - Charlie Flute-Dick. - Charlie Flute-Dick, that one. That dude was super gay. I practically forced him. No, thank you. Have a nice day! Girls... - Hi! - Hello! - How is it going with the signatures? - Well... It's been a tough day. Have you been talking about the sanctuary in Magdalena Bay which is here in...? - Yes, yes... - And? - It's weird, but it didn't work. - It did work for me precisely today. Eighteen. A day for whales! Yes, awesome! And you? Two, Daniela and Johana, Daniela and Johana. - So, basically you two. - Yes, they're tough times. The world needs more people like you, Mariana. Yes... Look, it's time. - Really? - That was fast! - It was, right? - See you tomorrow? - Same time? - Yes. - Thank you. - No, thank you for being solidary mammals, between you two, that is. Hey, guys... Would you like to sign a petition for...? Gabo! Gabo! Gabo! Get out! It's the fat barista, dude! No! Look at him! Who would know? Barista in the morning, rockstar at night... Multitask fat boy? Blessings, dolls! I'm sick of braces. Well, don't order more mojitos, then. I don't even like mojitos. You know why I order them. Yes, Daniela, because Gabo will fall in love with whoever orders his favorite drink. What do you know? Coincidences like that spark a conversation. Melissa, baby, it's always nice seeing you. We didn't know you were coming! I sent you 15 messages. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. Super duper sure? - Well, should I wait for you? - Nope, we'll stay a bit longer. Watch your braces when kissing each other. OK. There's no toilet paper there. Thank you! Are we staying a bit longer? Yes. I smiled at the bouncer to let us in backstage and he fell for it. - Are you sure? - Super duper sure! And I can't wait for Gabo to sign the twins. The twins? - The twins. - That's classy, Johana. Always! Your passes. You have them, right? I have them. Nope. I don't have them. - The thing is... - What's up, Bobby? - The car! - We left them in the car. - Come on, please! - Hi! - Five minutes. - Let them in. They're with me. Really? Thank you! Thank you. Sorry. I thought you only had influences at the café, but no! No! Chub's the dope! So? Do you want a picture with the musicians? - I'll go get Gabo. Daniela, right? - And Johana! Johana. I was the one in the keyboards. No, nothing. And me? Nothing? Chub! Stop flirting, dude. Hey, dude, take me home. Dolls, keep on flowing. Gabo! Before you go, could you sign these two? Sure, doll. Blessings, doll. Thank you... - Thank you! - Bye, Daniela. - Bye, Gabo! - Bye, Gabo. He has a nice signature, dude... What do you mean you didn't enroll anywhere? Do you think this is from his new video? Where might they be filming it? Are you really not going to study? I love him. - Fuck me! - What? Fuck, fuck, fuck! He just followed me. What? Who followed you? Melissa! Baby, why don't you get us some drinks? No, tell me what happened! It's always the same with you. I won't invite you to my house anymore. - Damn... - What, what? - He just sent you a message. - Really? Yes! - Damn! - What? What? - Damn, Johana, damn. - What, Daniela? What? - He wants to see me. - You?! But... he signed mine... Today, at the set. It has to be a mixup, because of the braces. He surely thinks you're me. Obviously. Meli, can I raid your wardrobe? You haven't given back the blue dress you borrowed for prom. I'm so jealous you'll meet him! Fucking Daniela barista. Johana, do you know what "barista" mean? Of course! That's how we call people we dislike, like the fat guy from the café. Barista is a person who works at a cafe, Johana. If you'll meet Gabo, we have to give you a makeover. OK, OK... But I don't want him to tell, OK? Like casual, but cool... Like I didn't try, but you do try, OK? Fat barista... of course! Keep on flowing, doll. This is yours, Gabo! Cut! That girl came looking for you. - Girls, open your arms wider. - OK, yes. Wow! You have your own camper and everything. Yes, I'm not into these things, but you know... The label insists. Do you want something to drink? I don't know... A mojito, maybe? Nah! I used to drink those before... Would you like some light beer? Yes. Sit down. - Thank you. - Mhm. You're a good drummer. No. I played the guitar. You have a guitar... I had one. And? My dad took it when he left. The fucker left us and took the guitar. That's heavy... It's OK. I bought a ukulele. You're funny. Hey, Dany, I was gonna to tell you... At the concert, Chub talked about you a lot. He told me you have an interesting flow. I think he was right. He doesn't know me that much, really. Well, but it's hard to meet interesting people in this country, don't you think? That's why I don't remember half the people I meet, really. Well, but that happens to famous people. Yes, right? But I remember you, Dany. Well, I'll tell you why I brought you here. I already told you Chub told me you were very interesting, smart and... well, obviously... gorgeous. And the truth is, Dany... Chub is super in love with you. And I think you would make a great couple. He's brilliant, a great guy, but he'll never take that step, you know? So I wanted to talk to you to... - Wait, wait. - Yes. So... you brought me here to ask me to go out with the big fat sweaty barista? Yes. - Doll, doll... - I can't believe this. Hey, hey, hey... This is between you and me, OK? I'm asking you from the depths of my heart because I want the best for my bro. You get it, right? The best for your bro, my ass, dude! - I don't buy it. - Dany! Dany! Why do you want me to date him? Chub writes my songs. OK? And right now... he's lacking inspiration, if you will. And I think your flow can help him out a bit. Hey! Doll! Baby, gorgeous... Do it for me. Even for one night, yes? Just one. That's fine. Are you asking me to fuck your friend, asshole? Look... If you do me that solid, I'll pay you with the same coin. Wha... How do I know you'll pay? I'm a man of my word. I don't believe you. Well, would you like a guarantee or what? Yes. OK... This watch was my grandpa's. It's an antique. If I don't deliver, you keep it. This is no antique, fucking hipster. I want a real guarantee. What do you want us to do? A contract or what? Yes. OK. OK. Deal. Let this video act as a contract between the two parties. If you do me a favor with Chub, I'll pay you back with the same coin. Right? - No. No! - What? Let's call it for what it is. What is it you want me to do and what will you do in return? For you to go to bed with Chub. To go to bed with him? To have sex with him. OK. So, it is hereby agreed that Mr. Gabo... Gabeau. Hernández. Mr. Gabo Hernández shall fuck miss Daniela Alvarado after she does the sacrifice of fucking the big fat sweaty barista that... what's his name? Gerardo. Gerardo. Send it to me. OK, and if you don't deliver, not only will I sell your antique, but I will also make this video viral and everybody, including your little friend, will find out who you really are. I didn't picture you like this. Doll, doll, come here. I can't believe you'll fuck the fat barista! We're just going out. We go to his place, I kiss him a couple of times and then I let him tell his friends we fucked. I can't believe you'll fuck him, Daniela. That's huge! Jo, listen... When you were little, your mom made you eat the broccoli soup, and did you like it? No. No, but you ate it so you could then have dessert. Yes, but one thing is broccoli soup and another the fat barista. I can't believe I'll lose my virginity to Gabo Gabeau. Daniela... - You're not a virgin. - Stop! Don't be a party-pooper. I'm living the dream for both of us. Hey! Girls! - Hi! - There's Mariana. Eh... Signatures? I can see you. I see you from here... Now I'm seeing you roll away. We're not that far away. I can see you just fine, in fact... now you're crawling. I can still see you. Hey, girls! Well, now I can't see you. Hi, Dany, how are you? Hi. Fine. I need a beer. Light. Here he comes. - Can I have some? - Yeah, sure. Wow. Oh, at that pace we'll finish in half an hour. I'm sorry, I was thirsty. Let me get you another one. Excuse me! - Eh, a light beer and... - I'm fine, thank you. That's it, thank you. Wow, you have connections here. It's not that. I just know how to ask for stuff. Thank you. What's with the face? Well, I don't know... I mean, you are... I'm trying to spark this up and you keep sending me out of the field. What field? You asked me out and I'm glad, but if you don't wanna be here, let's just drop it. I'm sorry. It hasn't been my day. - I do wanna be here. - OK. Let's start again. OK... Where are you going? Wait, girl. Excuse me, excuse me. Hi, how are you? Dany! I'm sorry I'm late. I got caught like by 20 fans getting in, you know. Really? The star guitar player. Nah. Truth is with Gabo I'm just a guest player. Why "guest player"? Gabo hired us to record his album, but that's not our project. - Another band? - Its name is Shut Up Eve! and it's... the bomb! Da fuck... You're thirsty, huh. I'm sorry, do you want another one? I might ask for another beer. The band is rehearsing at home. Don't you rather drink something there? The truth is the band is the best thing I have and I'd love it for you to come. Did you ask for this? Let's eat it. I think they were for another table. Excuse me, these were for another table. Aren't they on the house? Take them. That's fine. I had already grabbed this one. Let's go. That dude hates me badly. I see that. Do you always do this to him? It would't be the first time. - Hi, band! - What's up? She is Daniela. Please, make me look good. Aw, Chub, there's no need with you. How are you? - Fine, fine. - I missed you so much. - Me too. - Hi, nice to meet you. I'm... Yes, Emilia. I see you know our star backing vocalist. - Yes, I love your music. - Wow, thank you. Me too. What I don't love is when she goes with other bands, but... No, but you're my favorite band. Do you like Shut Up Eve!? - No, I haven't played her anything. - But I'd love to listen to it. Would you like beer, Dany? If you have piña colada... Chub, that's you. I'll get it for you. - Are you sure? - Sure. Thank you. I loved it. So? Better than reggaeton? Much better. May I ask you something? Why did you ask me out? So I didn't have to ask for the bathroom key anymore. Wouldn't you rather date Gabo? And miss this private concert? Won't you ask me to dance with you? Hold on tight. All of this is yours. Wow. I'm sorry. Am I going too fast? No, it's just that you're super hot. Daniela? Melissa! Don't you want to take a dive? - But... - Come on! The water's perfect. I swear. Please. Thank you! What, dude? Spit it out. Did you know it's 'ukelele' and not 'ukulele'? Yes, obviously. In fact, I looked it up and in Hawaii it's ukulele, but the Spanish translation is ukelele. Daniela, are you OK? We did it. What? So fast? He invited me to his house. - Cool... - We listened to his music, we danced, we slept together, we spooned... Wow! I can't believe it! I never thought I could like him so much! No... How wouldn't you if we all like him? - You too? - Obviously! We all do! And what if he can eat a whole plate of fries in a single bite, right? Gabo? Who's Gabo? Sorry, I got carried away. I drifted away. I'm just inspired. Yeah, I see. So, did you ask her out or what? Can you believe she asked me out? Oh, man! Well, come on. Again, without all that shit, OK? Well, the idea is good, but I think there's something a bit off between the harmony and the melody. A bit more... sassy? Yeah, right? It could be, but I rather think it's lacking dynamism. Hey... It might be silly, but what if you repeat the chorus twice? - No, I mean, thank you, but... - In fact, it's not a bad idea. I could do it and when you come back tomorrow you listen to it and tell me if you like it. Nice! You should be our manager. Dude, can you show me where we stored the guitar? Yes, let's go. Beauty and musical gift. Hey, a bird told me you did the favor I asked for. Yes. You don't have to worry about that. We can easily delete that video. That's good. I'm glad, doll. There's only that thing about my watch. Oops! I don't have it here. I wasn't talking about that. Go ahead. I'll see you in a bit. We'll talk later. Blessings, doll. Shall we? Yes. A total manager! Giving your opinions and everything. Only because you haven't heard me play... - Chub! - Oh, man! I'm so glad we found you! - What? What day is it? - No, I know. I know. I have Romina today, but let me switch for tomorrow. Please. As you can see, I'm not alone. - Melissa. Nice to meet you. - Daniela, what's up? It's an emergency. You know I don't do this. I never swap days, and let alone if I know he's on a date. But tomorrow's Friday, huh? - You can do something fun. - Are you for real? Come on. Honey, take care, OK? She's got homework to do! - How are you, kiddo? - It's 'dikko'! Ah, OK. Wait at the stairs, please. I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I was kind of ashamed. How could you be ashamed? She's so cute! She's got your eyes. She's not my daughter, Daniela. What? No, I'm her... nanny-manny. Alicia owns the apartment and I pay part of the rent taking care of her. Moron! So? Are we on for tomorrow? - Alright. Movies? - Sure. So... Bye? - Well, we agreed... - Tomorrow, yes. So? So movies tomorrow... baby-sitting Romina today. Doesn't she have homework? Alright. Let's go. - Na! - See? You're saying 'na' and it's 'no'. Dany, sing something to us. Yes, sing! If I sing, Romina will have nightmares. That's why I only sing for strangers, because I don't love them. For what I saw today, you have a good ear. To listen, not to play. Let's see those teeth, have you washed them yet? Yes. What did we say about lies? I can take a cavity, but not lies. Come on, go. And make them shine! Hey... - And her dad? - The asshole left. - What is it with men? - What? Not all of them. - You're right. Not you. - Yeah, well... My dad din't let me celebrate my birthday because it was on the anniversary of Jimmy Hendrix's death. Get out! September 18! Yes. Ready? Let's go to bed. Guess what? I wrote you a song while you were away. - You'll like it. I promise. - No. - It's about you today. - I said no! Get under the covers. Here we go, ready or not. Romina... I don't know why you're always dirty, Romina Why don't you get a bath, Romina? That's why You always smell like tuna, Romina Oh, Romina! - My turn. - Hit it. Gerardo... Your feet are like a cartoon's, Gerardo You live in the toilet, Gerardo You smell like fish, Gerardo Oh, Gerardo... Fishardo! Very good! None of that is true, but very good. I love you! This is the best day of my life! - Melissa! - Ay! Hey, Chub! Stop drinking. Come take a picture with us. Go ahead. - Doll! - Hi. I'll catch up with you. What's up? How are you? You're a huge success. Congratulations! Yeah, right? Yes, everything's flowing as it should. We have like two months booked and we're going on tour, so... That's great! I'm really glad. But I'm not leaving without paying you back that favor, which, apparently, you're still doing to me...? What favor? You know, Chub. Your flow's driving him crazy! Very good! You don't have to pay me back anything. We are more than happy, almost thanks to you. That's good! Yeah, I'm glad. Now, only my part is missing. I told you I was a man of my word. There's no need. Of course I need to, doll. I don't. Well, we already said that... if we don't do it, we have to tell Chub, right? And... - You won't tell him. - No, that's what the video's for. - There's no video anymore. - Of course there is! After she does the sacrifice of fucking the big fat sweaty barista... Why would I delete our only guarantee? No, I wouldn't do that to you. Look... We go out once and that's it. Go out? Yes... Dinner, drinks... a bit of... intimacy... - And we go our own ways. - I won't do that to Gerardo. You kinda already did when you recorded the video, didn't you? But that's why I'm telling you: you do your part and I'll do mine. And he won't even know. All good. I look for you tomorrow. Blessings. Are you leaving already? - Yes, I have a headache. - What? She's leaving! - Were you leaving me here alone? - Come on! You can't leave now that the foam party is starting. I wouldn't advise getting in the foam. - Can we go, please? - Yes, yes. Are you OK, Dany? Yes. My pressure dropped, or something. Nothing a bit of music can't fix. Liar, you tell me you love me And you cheat with anyone Just listen to that song. Cheat, you think that with words Everyone will fall for you Something heavier, right? What's wrong? Why are you still playing with Gabo? He's my friend. He was the first one to give me a chance and now he employs me. Do you want to come inside for a drink? You don't need that. To drink? I know I don't, but... like to... keep on hanging out, no? Gabo. Why? Did he tell you anything? I'm sorry. Let's better talk tomorrow, OK? I don't wanna be like this with you. Like what? I don't understand. You're scaring me. I'm sorry if I did something wrong. Was it because I made you go there? No. Because the only thing I could think about being there in that horrible place, filled with prejudiced and superficial fans is that I'm super lucky to have you. You see me for who I am. No one has ever made me feel like this. I'm sorry. Sorry why? This was awesome. Was? Why? What is it? You can tell me anything. What? Do you want me to leave? Life is for you, take it. It belongs to you. NWP Insurances. Is everything alright, mom? Yes. Were you crying? No. Are you alright? Yes. Were you crying? No. Hi. Are you interested in saving the whales? No, thanks. You could save my friend too, who's been recently dumped and devastated. Leave your number. We'll call you. I'm sorry. Johana, don't you understand I'm still in love with Gerardo? In love! So, why didn't you just tell him the truth? That I recorded a video calling him "big fat sweaty barista"? Where I say I'll fuck him to fuck his friend and for him to find out his friend is a real son-of-a-bitch and to hate me forever? - No, thank you, Jo. - Girls... - Can I see with you...? - We're on a break. Have a nice day. Listen to me... You fuck Gabo once, once, you live the dream of every woman, and that's it! You get back together with your fat barista, and no one will find out. No, no, no. I couldn't do that to Gerardo. Well... If you won't fuck Gabo, could you help me fuck him? What's worse is that now we have to find a new cafe to use the toilet. Or... not? That's not your chub. Where is he? According to Lucas 21... You don't have Chiapas coffee beans? I won't give you the bathroom key. Where's Chub? Not you, my chub. Get out of here, please. Look, mom! A whales show! Hi, Daniela! Get - the fuck - out. This was me, trapped before I met you. This was me, free when you came into my life. Go back to the ocean, fatso! - Hey, a little respect. - Shut up, fucking hater! Don't make me feel trapped again. Hey, no, that's not funny! You are not from Japan, are you? I wanted to respect your decision, but... after seeing you cry like that, I don't believe a single word you said. - You look happy. I can tell. - Yes. Yes, yes. You're right. About everything. I love you. And I won't ever let you go again. No more surprises, OK? - I really have to pee. - Go, go. I'm all wet and have to give this back. It's a rental. You look very handsome. Hey, come here. Do you still want to fuck Gabo? I have a plan. Wait. Listen carefully, Gabo Gabeau. I have a fantasy. And what is it, doll? To do it completely in the dark. I like fantasies. Let me explain the conditions. This is going to happen only once. It's an infidelity. You get it, right? That's why I want to use it to fulfill my fantasy. You and me, in a dark room, blindfolded, like playing you don't know whom you're with. I love your trip. Will you have anything else, guys? Nah. - Let's go to my hotel. - No, let's go to my place. No way! I have a super suite. Look, we turn on the jacuzzi, bubbles, room service... My place or the deal is off. Well, this... is my place. What's that? Are your parents here or what? No, no, no. Shit! That's odd. They're not... here. Wait here. I'll check my mom isn't here, just in case. I'm sure it's the cat, but I wanna be sure. Are you sure you don't wanna go to my hotel? Sure, sure. Pour yourself a drink. - Dumbass, what are you doing? - I'm sorry. Be quiet! I was thinking, this is like taking advantage of the dude, isn't it? OK, it's as if... you ask for a Ding Dong, and instead of a Ding Dong, you get a Zinger. It's practically the same thing. - It's not the same at all. - It is if you close your eyes. Another thing would be if you got a Sno Ball. - Ew, marshmallow. - Right? - Yes, marshmallow, coconut... - No! I hate it. OK, OK, but we're still taking advantage of him. Yes, Jo, but he deserves it. So, stop thinking, and live your fantasy. - ¿OK? - OK. I let you know. Breathe. Breathe, good. Everything's OK. Let's drink up. Hey. Don't be nervous. I'm... excited. It's my first fantasy. Well, let's fulfill it. Remember, right? Completely dark, no talking. Only body language up there. Lights off, not a single word. I can't wait to speak that language. OK, let's go! Let's speak that language. I'll be right back. I'll get a bit more comfortable. I'll wait, doll. OK. Don't you say a single word, ok? Or else he'll notice. Not even if he talks to you. Not a word. Don't worry. I won't talk. I'm too nervous. Wear a condom. OK, I'm out. Wait, wait. I don't undress that quickly. - Daniela, you're spitting on me. - I'm nervous! Let's go over what you'll do at the end. Ehh... if everything's alright, I'll say: "I'll be right back," I come to the bathroom, we swap again and that's it. You have to whisper. Jo, he can't tell the difference. Let's see, whisper. We're whispering now. No, this is too loud. You have to say, "I'll be right back." I'll be right back. Good. Let me spray you with my perfume. OK. Not that much. The smell will confuse him. Ready. Wish me luck. Good luck, girl. Are you alright? Shh. Oh, yes. I'm sorry. I'll shush. Shh. Oh, man! Shh. I'll be right back. Done? It was beautiful. Get undressed, mess your hair up, and wear this. OK. Hey... did he cry when he came? Yes. - But that's fine, right? - Not fine at all, Johana. Is there anything else I need to know? Sizewise... - Good. - Ok. As for his abs... very good, very good. OK. Daniela... - What? - Thank you. I think I'll cry too. Done. Eh, hey? I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Oh, eh... Yes, yes. I grab my stuff and I leave, right? Well, we'll talk later, no? Hey? Yes? Are you alright? I mean, because of... Yes. Sometimes that happens when... when I get too excited, you know? The flow takes over. Right, the flow. Yes. OK, we'll talk later, no? Blessings, baby. Hi, cute chub! What's up, manager? I miss you. Will you grant me the pleasure of seeing you now? What are you doing? Nothing. Are you with Johana? - Say hi to her for me. - She sends hugs. If you want, I can go to your place. No, no, no. I'll go to yours instead. My mom's about to get home. Sure? The band came yesterday for rehearsal and it looks like a pub. Daniela, sweet... Ay! I'm sorry! No, sorry, sorry. Fuck, fuck fuck! Damn! They have chakras, horoscope... Cats have everything, animals do. For example, what's your cat's sign? Let's see. I started checking my cat's chakras. Mine is Pisces. Yes. That's why he loves tuna fish. Hold on a sec. Hi. I come to get info for registration. The exam registration date is already due. So I can't register? An extension was made. So I can? But the call had already closed. Can or can't I? Let's see. Nothing, girl. - Can I borrow your pen? - Wait. Thanks. You know, these people leaving everything for the last minute. She comes to fill in forms... But I was telling you... For example, my cat is... - Pisces. - Thanks. - Thank you. - It's just one, hey! OK, what does this one say? - You took both, huh? - Com... muni... cation... Sci... I HAD A GOOD TIME I WANT MORE - Scien... - Sciences. IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN And what do they do? They're unemployed. And they sometimes work as baristas at some cafe. Look. This could be a good major for you. Entertainment Business Administration. How will this help me? It sounds good for you to be our manager. What? This is hella expensive. My mom has no idea how much it is to register here. Keep it. It might be useful. You, what are you doing? Can you explain to me what you did to him? I nail my part and you get mad? No, Johana! I let you play a bit and you score all goals against me. - You're supposed to be on my team. - What goals? I can tell you're spending a lot of time with Chub. He went crazy! Look! "Either we see each other again, or not only will I show our video to Chub, but I will also make it viral. Blessings." And he sent you eight eggplants. This is basically extortion. He's an asshole. I can't believe it. I told you from the beginning this was odd. Well, but I never thought he'd be so perverse. Well, what are you gonna do? What are we gonna do? - We? - We. OK. OK, let's see. What if we call him again and this time I give him a bad time? We make him lose interest. How? Doll, you ordered the whole menu this time, huh? I'm hungry. Don't judge. Yes, there you go. Let's go. - What? We just got here. Relax. - Let's go, dude. OK. - Now! - Coming, coming! You don't have to turn off the lights. I know you think I must only be with... knockouts or something, but it's fine. There's no need to be shy. Look, asshole. First of all, I'm a knockout. Second, this is not about shyness. And third, you are sick. If I do it with the lights off is because I don't wanna see you. Punish me, more. Doll. You got a hell of a flow! Done. It was awful. You're unbelievable, Johana. Oops. I don't know what you do to me. I really don't, but... This thing here is like... No. You have to dump Chub. What? You drive me crazy, what can I say? Where are you going? To the bathroom. Why don't you better go...? To the bathroom at your place? My mind was engaged with the plan, but my body wasn't. When you're in a moment like this, you can't control everything that's going on, you know? And I suddenly put a finger inside him - because part of the plan was that... - That you did what? Daniela. When are you planning on telling me what you do in this room? Because two seconds ago, Gerardo was here in the room. He was not Gerardo, mom. Remind me his name, then. Gabo. - Could you get out, please? - Gerardo is fat, right? Yes. Say "hi" to your mom. For you. Mom... I have to talk to Gerardo. I'm telling him the truth. Dany. - How are you? - Fine, and you? - Great. - What are you doing here, asshole? Nothing. I came to talk to Chub, but I was leaving already. - See you, dude. - Yeah. Do you want something to drink? No. Eh... I need to talk to you. Me too. Really? What happened? The thing is... I'm happy. Gabo came to invite me to the tour and I told him I can't. I don't wanna leave you. It is the first time I have something great, without lies, without prejudices. We love each other well. When something is going fine, I don't know, something happens, but not this time. I'm happy and I want to carry on with the band, with my music, and stop doing somebody else's. I love you, Daniela. And was there something you wanted to tell me? I feel exactly the same. I'll take care of this. After what you did last time? No way! You won't fix anything. No, I won't blow it again. Just give me your phone, thanks. We need... a distraction to steal his phone and delete the video. Why the fuck did you ask Gabo to go to my place? You won't fuck him again, Johana. Who told you I'll fuck him again? If it's about having the worst sex ever, it clearly won't be with me. - Melissa! - Hi, baby! Hi, baby. How are you? Great, I miss you. When are you coming to my house? You go and be happy with your chub. Just leave your phone for setting it up with the sicko. - No. - Are you with Dany? I hear Dany. - Trust me. - Hello? Johana! Do you wanna be happy with your chub? Are you coming over? I made mojitos. Great. - Hi. - Can you hear me? Are you there? Yes, what are you doing? I couldn't hear you. You know, the signal... Are you home? Well, guys. See you. - I do see you head over heels. - Yes, dude. I'm very much in love. Lucky chub! Hey, Chub. Do you know what would be great? For you to surprise Dany. How? Well, since you are together, you have a great flow. - You can tell in your music, right? - Yes. - Bring her serenade. - Yes, they're cool. I mean, corny, but cool. Fo sho. No, dude, maybe on her birthday. Come on, when's her birthday? September eig... Where's the romantic spirit within you, dude? No! Surprise her today. I'll help you. See you there in... half an hour? Send me the location. "Where's the romantic spirit within you?" Hi. Where's Gerardo? Everybody went to your place. What do you mean "everybody"? Damned Johana. What's up, doll, are...? No, no, no! Daniela? No, no, no! Who are you? What da fuck are you d...? No, hell no! What's up, dude? What is Gabo doing in your girlfriend's bedroom? - Hold this for me. - Yes. Couple of rapists! If Dany doesn't show up in 30 segundos, I swear... - What da fuck is going on? - Chub, please. - What da fuck, Dany? - What da fuck, Dany? Gabo, get out of my house. No, no one leaves until you tell us exactly what da fuck is going on. OK, OK, I'm the one who's gonna explain. OK. I fucked Gabo, and Daniela only did it with you. Yeah, right, and the kisses you gave me? - Those were for you to leave. - Well, that's convenient! Do you really don't recognize me? What a way to make fun of everybody, Daniela. Chub, please... You know what, why don't we explain him with the video of the sweaty and fat barista? - Hey, asshole! - Gabo! - Give me... - Check your phone. Shall fuck miss Daniela Alvarado after she... - Gerardo, please, don't watch it. - the sacrifice of fucking the big fat sweaty barista that, what's his name? - Gerardo. - Gerardo. Hello. Is everything OK? Mom, get out, please. - You are Gerardo. Nice to meet you. - Mom! - Hi, ma'am. - Not now. Bye, see you. She went out with you to go out with me. That was the deal. Really? Yes, but I didn't know you then. Now you are what matters the most to me. You went out with me to be with him? Yes, but after dating you, I didn't want anything from anybody else. And you asked her to go out with me in exchange of sex? Chub, it was for your own sake, dude. Now you have a killing flow. I mean, you should thank me... Here's your fucking flow, asshole. Are you alright? Gerardo. I love you, ok? If I didn't tell you was not to hurt you. If you really love me, don't look for me again. I don't wanna see you again. - Gerardo. - No. Dany, should I leave you alone? Please. Baby? Careful. Hey. Careful. No, this way, over here. Good. After she does the sacrifice of fucking the big fat sweaty barista... You had to deliver to Gerardo? No, to Gabo. Gabo was the one of the idea. Gabo and Chub asked you to do this. No, no, no. Look. At first, I wanted to be with Gabo, that's why I accepted. But then I was with Chub and I regretted it, and Johana was with Gabo, while he thought he was with me. You see? The sacrifice of fucking the big fat sweaty barista... I found this. Oh, right. It's from when I went to register for the exam. I won't do it. It's too expensive and we don't have the money. I saw you underlined some stuff. I don't wanna study, anyways. And that major is like for frustrated musicians. I don't see how studying something you want is frustrated. Your dad, who's the worst architect in the world, really is a frustrated musician. - My frustrated dad. - And a frustrated husband. Didn't he leave when he found out you were...? A lesbian? Yes, but that's not why he left. Telling him I was confused was the perfect excuse he was waiting to be free and live his dreams. I spoke with him last week. I told him that either he pays you college tuition or I sue him for all those years of child support he owes me. Let me know when you pass the exam to pay the registration. Hello, good morning. Can I have five min...? OK, have a nice day. Hey, Dany... - Today's your last day. - Yes. I think I managed to get four signatures the whole summer. Three, if you don't count Johana's. And how is she? - Did she start college yet? - Last week. And do you know what you'll study? Entertainment Business Administration. I start in January, which gives me a couple of months to find bands and convince them to be their manager. Hey, but wasn't the nice fat guy a musician? Yes. Let's say he's no longer interested in my services. Hi, can you give me five minutes for... Have a nice day, on behalf of the whales. Hey, and... don't you get tired? Me? No, never. Even if nobody cares about what we're doing? See, I know I can't save the life of all whales in the world, but... I don't know. Being able to fill a list of signatures and improving the life of one whale makes me happy. Someone has to fight for the lost causes, don't you think? You're right. No, no. What are you doing? Fighting for a lost cause. Thank you for everything. Thank you. I knew she had it in her. Hi, good afternoon. Can I have five minutes for a petition? It's a signature for whale conservation in the Gulf of Mexico. Thanks a lot. Oh, you finally got out of your cave, Chub. Hey, hey. What are you doing? - "Aring" a little bit. - It's "airing". See you at night. Take care of him, Romina. Did you forget the keys? Oh, you. No, thank you. - Someone's knocking! - Nope. Listen for a moment and I'll be gone. Don't you get I don't wanna see you again? Crystal clear. I want to tell you the whole truth. I'm sorry What I did sucked I'm sorry I don't want you to be bummed It is true that when I went out with you, friend It was actually to fuck your friend I'm sorry I called you fat and sweaty I deserve being eaten by a Yeti I'm not just saying it I wouldn't repeat it Although I didn't cheat Johana fucked him Sex and love in the same bed Is so hard to find That's why now that I have you I'll never leave you behind And it's not that you're not fat now or just a tiny bit sweaty But I love you now And with you I feel plenty It's like if someone told you To fuck with... I wouldn't do it. Well... I would. Clearly. He texted me, got my hopes up I don't know He's every girl's crush I'm just 19 years old I'm stupid and these things Happen to me So we filmed a shitty video And now I'm all alone And nothing cheers me up And I just didn't know you I didn't know what I was doing Sex and love in the same bed Is so hard to find That's why now that I have you I'll never leave you behind And it's not that you're not fat now or just a tiny bit sweaty But I love you now And what we have is beautiful You were right. What? You're a crappy singer. What, are you leaving? - I thought that... - Do you still wanna be our manager? You sing terribly. - Romina! - Oh, yes. She heard your whole song. Dude! Look. - Get out! - Yes. Oh, Melissa. My god! - Hi. - Hi. Hey, manager. We sold out, right? You deserve it. Ready, guys? You're up. Giddy-up, band! It's always the same with you! - Oh, no! - Cut! Open your eyes wide. Open them more, a lot. Open them. Get closer. Damn, Román, open them, dude. Let's go. What? Let's go. Who followed you? Melissa, baby, can you get us something to drink? Please. - I had. - And? My Dad took it when he left. The fucker left us and took the guitar. That's heavy. Again, from your arrival there. Hey, Dany, I was gonna to tell you... I was gonna to tell you... I was gonna to tell you... I'm sorry. No! It was you, dude!
