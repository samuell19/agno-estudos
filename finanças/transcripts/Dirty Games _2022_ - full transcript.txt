Lucy? Lucy, I need to borrow your phone. What, why? I said, why do you need to borrow it. Mine's dead. So charge it. I am, but it's taking too long, and I need to know how many likes I've got on my post. Oh my God, you're obsessed. Says the one with 10,000 followers. I'm surprised you're not on there, anyway. I'm waiting for a phone call actually. Fine, please, can you check it for me? It's had 78 likes, so far. Not bad. While my latest post has over 3,000. Shut up. Who are you waiting for a phone call from anyway, that game show? Yes, the game show. It's called The Game of Love. So you think you're gonna get in? I think so. Anyway, you're not allowed to watch. Why not? Well, because I might be enjoying some activities, which I'd rather my sister didn't see. You're actually willing to do stuff while people are watching? Ah, yeah. If it helps me win. But why? Because I can't stay at home forever, can I? Oh. Hello? Yes, speaking. Oh, wow. That is such a shock. Uh, yes. Yeah. Okay. I'll see you next week, okay bye. Thanks. Hi, it's so nice to meet you. Oh, hello. I'm Jasmine. Lucy, nice to meet you. I'm Naomi. Oh hi, Lucy. You're really pretty. Oh, thank you. Naomi was hoping you'd be a boy. I wasn't hoping. I just thought they might mix it up a little bit. Well, this place definitely looks bigger from the outside, doesn't it? Yeah. I thought so, too. Well, you ladies found the bedrooms yet? Oh yeah, they're upstairs. Let's show you. Cool. Well, Jasmine and I have already chosen our rooms, 'cause well, I got here first, so I thought I'd pick the one I like. Well, which ones are free? Are there any more upstairs? Yeah, I'm sure there's more upstairs. Okay. You don't even have a proper window. Oh, it's okay, I'm not here for the views. So how many of us do you think will be playing? There's gonna be a few, right? Well, if there's 10 rooms, maybe there's 10 of us. What kind of tasks do you think they'll want us to do? Well, all sorts I expect. Is the show being screened on TV? I heard it was only online. Well for the money we were playing for, I don't care where they show it. You're playing win then? Aren't we all? Anyone up there. Hello? The first boys, right? Wait, two boys at once. Oh my God. This is so exciting. But there's three of us. What does that mean? I don't care, come on. Let's go and say hello. Hello boys. Hi. God, this is so exciting, isn't it? Hi, I'm Jasmine. Hey I'm James, it's nice to meet you. Naomi. If you need help remembering it's I moan backwards. This is nice. This is Luce. Yeah hi, I'm Lucy. Nice to meet you. Any more of you girls upstairs? It's just us. Must be our lucky day, James. Must be. How come you both arrived at the same time? We were told to. Producers said that we are last ones to arrive today as well, so. That means we're all here then. Today, more may arrive tomorrow. Great, let's have fun then, not stand around like lemons. You are so right. Well, bedrooms are upstairs if you wanna drop your stuff, and while you do that, I'm gonna find the alcohol. Yeah, I could use a drink. You girls go and find the drinks, 'cause I'm gonna take the boys upstairs and show them their rooms. Sounds good. See you guys later. I think the kitchen's through here. Perfect, must be in the fridge. Oh. Hmm, jackpot. How do we feel about champagne? I'll get the glasses. - Cheers. - Cheers. Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Hey, you found the booze then. It's not Dom Perignon or anything, but it will do. I wouldn't know, I've never tried it. Oh my God, you should. Just think I'll stick to a beer to be fair. The fridge behind you. Do you drink a lot of champagne then, do you, or? Christmas, birthdays usually, that sort of thing. And where are you from? Surrey. You? Nottingham, where'd you go to school? You wouldn't know. Try me. Wisely School for Girls. You went to an all girls school? Yeah, I mean, it's not like what you think in the movies or anything. It's like a private school though, right? Yeah, why? Are you- Yes, champagne. Just what we need to liven things up. Callum, champagne? Can be very sure. Here you go. Here's to us, first ones to arrive. The OGs. Woo. Don't you look adorable? I thought you said you the last ones to arrive? Oh, I'm not playing, I'm the presenter. Oh my God, is the game starting now? Actually the game started the moment you walked in, but there are a few things we need to go over. Join me in the lounge? To start, I want to say how glad we are that you all decided to be part of our little show. It's so exciting to have you all here for our debut. As you know, the Game of Love is being streamed online. There are cameras hidden throughout the house, in all the rooms. Yes, even the washrooms. These have already started recording. But as I said, there are a few details that we need to go over before things really get going. One of those is these. These phones will be incredibly important during your stay in the manor. They will be giving you instructions throughout the game. To help our viewers, these phones have been set up with an automatic text to speech service. So any messages you do receive will be read out loud. Also, as you know, the Game of Love has a 250,000 pound cash prize for the winning couple. It's a lot of cash. But, we wanna give you guys a chance to increase that. As the game progresses, you will be given a variety of tasks to complete. These will come through to your phones. To mix things up, we are giving our viewers the chance to send through ideas and requests for you to complete as these tasks. Viewers, make sure you click on the link below the screen, have your credit card available at hand, if you wanna send through a request. The more challenging the requests, the more money you will win. Finally, there will be several couplings throughout the show. During these, you have the chance to become an official couple or stay a singleton, but here's where things get tricky. There will be internal voting to see who stays in the manor. Singletons are safe from elimination, but only a couple can win the game. Everyone with me? The last couple standing is the winner of the game. So, before I go, we are gonna do our first coupling. Callum, what will it be? Singleton. Naomi, what will it be? Couple up, or stay a singleton? Singleton. James, what will it be? Would you like to couple up or stay a singleton? I think I'll stay at singleton. Jasmine? What will it be? Couple up, or stay a singleton? Singleton. And Lucy? Singleton. Excellent. My work here is done. Welcome to The Game of Love. The game has officially begun. That's a really cool, Callum. Yeah, I mean, it's really. Lot of people a lot of businesses. So why do you think they haven't given us our challenges yet? Dunno, just easing us in, I guess, like warming us up. I mean we could play a game ourselves, guys. I know. Spin the bottle. No, certainly not, what are we, 14? Okay. Me next. Oh. Hey guys. My turn. No. What? I'm not gonna kiss you. Come on, mate. What, she's not my type. It's a game. Yeah, well they're not offering us cash for it now, are they? So what's the point? All players, please go to the games room. Oh, I was in here earlier, that wasn't there. Oh, somebody must've came in and set it out while we were eating. I am so excited. Nice, this is together. Play strip poker. 1000 pounds added to the prize fund for each person playing. Strip poker? Oh, what's that Callum? Scared you're gonna lose? Not at all. Looking forward to seeing you girls strip. Go easy on me. I'm not gonna promise, darling. All right. I'll deal. All right. Go on, go on Callum. Three. No, come on. Okay. Can we? Right. I'm done. I need to go to bed. Oh, come on. Come on and finish it, I want to see your tits. Okay. - Come on. - Take 'em off. What's going on? Socks do not count in the game. Of course they do. No. For fuck sakes then, I'm done. Another round then? Deals. Hey. Take them off, take them off, take them off. Hey. 15,000 Pounds added to the prize fund if you have a threesome. No fucking around. I've never had a threesome. Oh, don't worry. We'll take it slow. Come here. What's going on? I don't know. Look who's just arrived. Hey mate, you all right? Hi. How are we doing? Hey, you okay? Yeah, last night was fun. Yeah. Yeah. It was. It was. What do you make of Harry? Yeah, he seems nice, but haven't spoken to him much. I think Naomi likes him. Exotic place in anyway. A coupling will take place this afternoon. Harry will choose first, after spending time with all the girls. Lucy and Harry, please go into the garden for your date. That was quick. Would you reckon there Lucy, fancy a bit of that? Yeah, sure. Makin', cool. Sorry about that. I don't think everyone does wear them to be fair. What's that? Oh. Ooh. How about that? Where do you wanna sit, Lucy? Yeah? You're very charming. Maybe a bit old fashioned. Yeah, I like it. Aw, what a great way to start the day. Well, great day at the office. Evil work, isn't it? Yeah. Thanks for booking this. You're welcome. So Harry, tell me about yourself. What do you wanna know? Something, something you've never told anyone else. You and Harry getting it rolling. Yeah, why? Yes. Maybe. Naomi, please go upstairs to bedroom eight alone. Well, certainly can't go to Redding anymore, that's for sure. You're pulling my leg. Am I? 3000 Pounds will be added to the prize fund if you touch yourself in front of the mirror. Do it faster. Oh. Okay, all right. Well what about you? Have you ever done anything crazy along the way? Mm. Probably, this show. - Fair. - Yeah? Yeah. It's only been 24 hours and it's crazy. - Really? - It's wild, yeah. It's not always as calm as this? Is that bringing that wildness? You're in for a treat. - Really? - Mm-hm. Naomi is that, oh God, sorry. 10,000 pounds will be added to the prize fund if you help Naomi finish. Take off Jasmine's top. Have you seen Jasmine? She's supposed to be going on a date with Harry. Nope. Okay. What was all of that about last night, by the way? What? When we were playing spin the bottle. Why didn't you kiss me? Well, I told you, you're not my type. I think we've gotten enough on the wrong foot. No. You clearly have a problem with me. As hard as it may be for you to believe, not everything revolves around you, all right? Look, I don't have a problem with you, just every thing you fucking stand for. Please go into the kitchen for the next coupling. Yeah. Have again. Time for the coupling. Harry, will you couple or stay a singleton? Ooh. I would like to couple please with Jasmine, if you fancy? I agree to couple with Harry. Callum, what is your decision? I'd like to couple with Lucy. Huh? I agree to couple with Callum. Naomi, will you couple or stay at singleton? Singleton. James, what is your decision? Flooded with choice, but guess I'll stay a singleton, then. The coupling is complete. Oh my God. A new person. A box. Well yeah, thanks. All right, tonight, there will be a dress up party. Please make sure you wear the costume assigned to you. Amazing. Oh wow. You got to be kidding me. Beautiful. Jesus, this is a shit show. Oh yes. Come on, naughty boy. Cheers to the sexiest ladies I've ever met. And to James. See you swaggerin' and all in that mate. Fuck you. Feels like you've got a bit of a temperature. What? I'm gonna have to give you a full examination. Oh, cracking. Touch him. What an interesting scar. Touch her. Does that feel better? if you touch yourself. What about now? Yeah. Hey, how are you doing? Oh, you know, just making some cash. Looks like they've been making some cash too. Oh yeah. Play truth or dare. 500 pounds will be added to the prize fund for every honest answer or completed dare. Well, that's settled then. Naomi, truth or dare? Dare. Nibble Callum's earlobe for 15 seconds. Wait, the viewers are playing, too? I don't mind. Lucy, truth or dare? Truth. Why are you you here? Because I was invited to be. But why? To find love or, or what? Yeah, to couple with someone. Yeah. Not to win? Do you actually care who you're coupled up with? Isn't it someone else's turn now? No, no. I think just let Lucy answer the question. She answered, mate. Do you really think she cares about you? How fucking dare you. It's an easy enough question to answer, Lucy. You look healthy. Naomi, just because you're a slut. So jealous! Take it easy, what are you doing? Come on, I think we've all just had a bit too much to drink. Yeah, let's just, why don't we just call it a night, eh? Hey whoa. Fine with me. Wow. Morning. Morning. Look Lucy, I think, I think I owe you an apology for, for how I acted like what. Just, what I said was that out of order. I mean we're all in for different reasons and. You know, saying, I owe you an apology isn't actually saying, sorry, you know that don't you? That's fair. No, I know I've been a dick. And for, for last night and before, everything that I've said, the way that I've acted, I am truly sorry. You know, next time, try getting to know somebody before you accuse them of being a shit person. I mean. I know, I know, I will. I'm sorry I've been such a dick. Good. So, do you want some breakfast? Yeah, of course, come on. I'll help you make it. Mayo and scrambled egg together? That's horrible. What's your problem with Mayo and scrambled eggs? It's no different from egg salad. They're completely different. Am I interrupting something? Fucking hell, where's Naomi when you need her? What? Don't worry, he's distracting. Hi, I'm Lucy. Nice to meet you. Liam. So you are beautiful. Oh thank you. Oh my God, a new arrival! There it is. There's four of them, now. We haven't had anymore girls arrive. Oh, that's fine by me. Especially if they all look like Liam. Time for a game. Play, guess who. Girls are blindfolded and must guess the order of the boys kissing them. 250 pounds for each correct guess. Now that's my kind of game. Jasmine, you will now be kissed by the four boys. Jasmine, what are your predictions? Callum, Liam, Harry, of course, and James. You have won 500 pounds. Yay. Smashed it. Naomi, what are your predictions? Harry, then James, Liam, then Callum. Mm, Callum, James, Harry, Liam. You have won 250 pounds. What? There will now be a girl's choice coupling. Naomi, will you couple or stay a singleton? I'm gonna couple with Callum. I agree to couple with Naomi. Lucy, what is your decision? I would like to couple with Liam. Hmm? I agree to couple with Lucy. Jasmine, will you couple or stay a singleton? I'd like to couple up with Harry. Nice. I would love to couple with Jasmine. James, you are a singleton and safe from elimination. All players must now text in the names of the couple they think should leave the manor. What? Literally right now? Jasmine and Harry, you have been eliminated. You must leave the manor immediately. No way, man. See you guys. Good luck everyone. Take it easy. Well, at least they got to leave together. At least I'm only the fifth wheel now. Good luck. Be good. It feels weird that they've left, doesn't it? Yeah well, guess it's a game isn't it? Yeah, but I mean we're still here, and Liam's joined us now. I'm excited to get started, and to get to know you. What about you, James? Mister Always a Singleton. You think there'll be another girl arriving soon? I might fucking hope so. Haven't had much luck so far, have I? The man's been abusive. We still have fun. Yeah, well. Actually, does anyone know how much we've won so far? Current prize fund is 285,750 pounds. She sure answered that question. James, Liam and Lucy, please go into the garden. Naomi, please go to your bedroom with Callum. Oh my God. When will you be coming up there? Callum, hurry up. The prize fund will be increased to 650,000 pounds if you- Well, this is gonna be fun. So where are you from, Liam? Oxford. Italian on my mom's side. Oh, that's interesting. Hello, big boy. 10,000 pounds added to the prize fund if you have sex on this bed. Surely. We're gonna win. Come on. So did you watch the show before you came? No, I mean, I tried to, but I couldn't find the right link. Oh. So where are you from? Surrey. Do you know it? Yeah, about an hour away. From where? From Oxford. Oh, okay. Please don't stop. Yeah, oh yes, don't stop, don't stop! Yeah, they thought I was crazy. Naomi? Naomi's having a good time as always. Must be a new arrival. Naomi! Something's not right. Oh my God. Naomi, can you hear me, Naomi? No, no, no, no, no. No no no no no no. She's not breathing. She's not breathing. The hell she's not. What do we do? What do we do? Call an ambulance Liam, quick. I'm on it. Naomi, can you hear me? Naomi? There's something wrong with these phones. They're blocking outbound calls. We've gotta do something, they must be fucking watching. What happened? Help us please. She's dying. She's dying. Please, quickly, she's dying. That's a lot of blood. This is bullshit. They told me to do it. Okay guys, so Callum's journey ends here. He was involved in the accident that led to Naomi's, well, you know, such tragedy. I mean, what happens now? Is someone coming to pick us up? No sweetie no, not unless you want 'em to. The producers want you to stay. After all, we've yet to find a winning couple, and for your trouble, we've agreed to increase the cash prize to 650,000 pounds. How does that sound? Would you like to stay? Excellent, well, let's head back inside and as always any information will come through to your phones, and goodnight. Well, goodnight guys. Guess I should call it a night, too. Would you, could you maybe stay with me tonight? I don't know if I can be on my own after that. Sure. Okay. You don't think Callum meant it, do you? Hmm? You know, before, outside, he said something about them making him do it. What? I dunno. It just feels weird. He's probably in shock. Didn't know what he was sayin'. Yeah. Maybe. Do you want to talk about it? You're right, I mean, it's the shock. You should probably get some sleep. Well, I should probably get a shower. Oh shit, Liam. What are you staring at? Just looking at you. What time is it? Almost noon. Why don't you put on some clothes, and I'll make us breakfast. Oh, okay. Morning. Morning. You sleep all right? Yeah, all things considered. What's for breakfast? Green smoothie. Oh, thanks. Hello, darling. Georgia, what are you doing here? I'm the new arrival, aren't I? Sorry, do you two know each other? We're acquainted. Hi, I'm Georgia, Jamie's ex-girlfriend. Sorry, what is this? I can, I can explain everything. You know, it's just, we- Jamie broke up with me last week, and then a few days ago I found out he's on this show, getting fucked. Look, I just, I can explain everything. Don't worry Jamie. I forgive you. You, you do? Yeah, of course I do. And I can completely understand why you did it too. Really? Yeah, absolutely. The producers called and well, they offered me a role in the show and they said we don't actually have to be broken up. We can be in this together. So what'd you say? You wanna get back together and couple up? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah. Mm. James and Georgia are now coupled. Mm, isn't this exciting? Yeah. So exciting. I think it's great. I'm Liam, by the way. So when did you arrive? Literally, just now. So you've not seen the rest of the estate yet. We'll give you the tour. That'll be amazing. I just need to drop my bags off upstairs. I'll help you. Lucy, you coming? Yeah, of course. I just need to finish my breakfast. Jamie? Yeah, I'll be right there. I'll just, I'll just clean these up. All right? You have some fucking nerve. Don't start. Don't start? How dare you. You judged me on the spot the day I arrived, saying something like, everything I stand for when you've just done that? Look, you know nothing about this situation. You know nothing about me. So. You are a selfish fucking prick. Oh I'm, I'm selfish? Yes. Says the one who coupled up with Callum to get close to the prize. Oh my God, we're all here to win. At least I'm not a hypocrite. Oh, I'm a hypocrite as well now, okay. Yes. I mean, do you even wanna get back with her? Yes, obviously. Seriously? Okay, or are you just doing it because you know you're gonna end up a singleton again. Oh God, like I say, you know, absolutely nothing about me. What, are you scared she's just gonna find out you're in it for the cash? Or I don't know. I don't know, James. I'm warning you. What? If you say anything to Georgia. What are you gonna do when all this is over? Are you just gonna, are you gonna finish with her again and. Just, you know, nothing about the situation? Just, just, shut up. What? We aren't so high and mighty now, are we, eh? Why? What James? What? Are you going to let her get away with that? 25,000 pounds will be added to the prize fund, if you get revenge, instructions will follow. Jamie? Where are you? Coming. Yeah, some of these. I think this hedge works its way all the way around the estate. Seems pretty secure. You think it is? Oh yeah. I think so. What a cute sound. It's a nice day, we should do something. There's a pool on the other side. A pool? Why didn't you say so? Let's go. Coming, Luce? Yeah, yeah. I just need to check something really quickly. I'll be there in a minute. I'm assuming. I reckon we could do find some purpose here. Mm, really? Me and Jamie against you and Luce. Maybe, I mean, everyone's been eliminated. It's only me and Lucy left from the original five. Mm, getting the original five. Some how it's sane. Who knows? A whole new group could arrive tomorrow. Or tonight. Yeah. For tonight. Anything can happen. Time for a treasure hunt. Work as a couple to find the manor's secret room, and enjoy the delights within. You have 30 seconds to discuss strategies. I know exactly what to do. Good, because I do not have a plan. We need to split up. Huh? The instructions says that we've gotta work as a couple to find the room. We will be. We'll cover more ground that way, right? Yeah. I guess. Just trust me. Okay, well, what if one of us finds the room? Do we need a meeting point or? One that finds it gives a shout to the other from there. Okay, I've got. The treasure hunt has begun. This way. How do you know ways? Well, doesn't really feel like much of a treasure hunt, does it? Are you complaining? No, I'm set. Go, because we can always let Liam and Lucy enjoy the delights, but then instead of you. No, sorry. I think it's better to find it so quickly, that's all. Wow. I have a surprise for you. You're gonna love it. What do you think? 10,000 pounds will be added to the prize fund if you use the room. I think that can be arranged, don't you Jamie? Yes. Georgia is the dom. Get down on your knees. Punish James. I will. Who's been a bad boy? I have. Who needs to be punished? - I do. - Louder. I do, Mistress. Yes. You do. Take off your clothes, get on the bed. Yes, Mistress. Liam? Yeah? Have you found anything yet? No. Oh. Can you free yourself? Now wait. Go slower. Liam, where have you found? You deserve this. What's happening? Do you like this? Yes. Do you think I should keep going? Yes. I've got a wild one. Kill Naomi. The prize fund will be increased to 650,000 pounds, if you kill Naomi. Georgia. James, James. James. You can't save him. Finish the treasure hunt. Fuck you. Fuck you, fuck you and your fucking game. Get off him you bitch. Come here bitch. James? James, are you okay? She tried to kill me. I know, I know. I can't believe it, she tried to kill me. I know they sent me a recording of it. What the fuck? I know, I'm just, I'm glad I got here before, I don't know. I thought you were dead. Okay. Right. Okay. Put on some pants and then we'll talk to your girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. So what the fuck was that about? You don't know what you're talking about. Georgia, you just tried to kill me. You dumped me via text, to come on a fucking dating show. You said you understood. No, it doesn't mean, I thought it was a good in. Oh poor little Jamie with all of his debts. Just get a payment plan like any normal fucking person. Oh, fuck you. All right. Look, while I agree it was a dick move, but I don't think it's reason to murder someone. Just one of the reasons. One of the reasons, what other reasons are there? They told me to. Who? They did. Why? They called me, and said the viewers needed more twists, and I could get my revenge with no consequences. You're lying. And why would I lie? Because you have to be. So what happened to Naomi was just an accident, was it? Well, yeah, of course it was, she fell. No, No. Callum pushed her. What the fuck? While I was searching in the treasure hunt earlier, I found Callum's phone and there was a message on there. They, they said something to him asking him do. And how exactly did you know to come looking for Miss Lucy? This should be recording. Exactly. They're watching everything. They love it when we fuck. And they love it when we fight. Which reminds me Lucy. Where's Liam? Liam is waiting for you. Liam? Oh my God. What the fuck, now? Quick, we just find him before. Come on. Liam? Lucy? What do we do? Help me find him. Time for another game. Play murder in the dark. James, James, I'm scared, I'm scared. It's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Listen, now then, there's a torch in your phone. Okay, it's gonna be all right. Come on. Come on. Let's do it. What if he's outside? Where is it? The hedges, they go all the way around. How are we supposed to get out? Well through the front gate, surely. It'll be locked. It'll be locked by now. Just. I dunno, through the forest? Yeah, okay. James, James, no. Lucy, run. James, no! Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are. You actually thought I wouldn't find out about you and James? Yeah. I saw you in the kitchen. Just don't understand it though. We were gettin' on so well, Luce. Never mind. Never mind. You made your choice and now you can pay for it. Please Liam, please please. It's just a game, it's just a game. Please let me go, please. A game journey? What else could it be? I wasn't meaning it like that. You go around fucking everyone? Humiliate me in front of all these fucking cameras. It wasn't like that, I swear. Please Liam, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Shut up. I fucking hate smoothies. Are you okay? Yeah. Can you stand? Yeah. I think so. Let's get the fuck out for real this time. James, James. We have to go. It's okay. Wow. Well done, you two. What a show! What? Gosh, it was getting really tense toward the end there, wasn't it? Ladies and gentlemen, meet your winning couple. Congratulations, Lucy and James. What are you talking about? You have just won the Game of Love. Woo! Woo! We're here now. Lucy, James. Hi. - Hello. Hi. Sorry we're late. The traffic was horrible. No problem. Although, you can't really be late arriving at your own house, can you? Oh yeah. Guess not. True, anyway, here are the keys and the final bits of paperwork. I guess all that's left to say is, congratulations. So what are we unpacking first, love? Well, the bedroom, obviously. You make a sweet couple. I hope you'll be very happy here. It's a very safe neighborhood. Yeah, thanks. Actually, if you don't mind me asking, it's just, you're also the youngest cash buyers our agency's ever had. And how did you afford the profit? Do you both work in finance? We kind of came into some money last year. Win the lottery, did you? Something like that, yeah. Oh, right. Anyway, I'd better be going. Any questions at all, you know where we are? Thanks. Oh, let's get these boxes in, eh? - Finally. - Yeah. Sweet home, baby. Hi there. Oh, hello mate. Moving in, are you? Yeah, yeah. We just bought at the house. Congratulations. Welcome to the neighborhood. Thanks, oh you, you live around here, do you? Oh yeah, sorry, I should have said. I'm across the road there. Oh. It's lovely street. Fairly safe. Oh wow. That's good. I just wanted to say, I loved you in the show last year. Really? Yeah, yeah. I was rooting for both of you the whole time. You watched the whole thing? Absolutely. I was hooked. I even sent some request in. Couldn't believe it when I heard the messages read out. I felt famous. Anyway, hope you settle in. Well, have a good day. Oh fuck.
