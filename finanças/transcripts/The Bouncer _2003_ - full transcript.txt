Do you need to speak with someone? I would like to see my father. May I have a couple of minutes alone? Yes, of course. I'll be right outside. THE MAN BEHIND THE D00R Hi, Daddy. - Where is the bitch? - Long time, no see. Where the hell is she hiding? Where is the bitch? She's not here, I promise you. I've been searching for her for weeks! I don't get food. I don't get anything. I've had enough. You look like someone who needs a beer. How many times have I said it? Beer isn't kept in the fridge, dammit! I don't care. Got to keep something in the fridge. Who the hell are you? You're that ... Susanne. You're Susanne. You think I'm senile? Lizzie and I have been together for over a year! Does no one in this sad-ass country understand me? You could learn some Danish. Drop all those nasty comments! Understand? Huh? And you tell your mother not to come back anymore. I'm so tired of that damn pill-addict. That self-important air of the martyr. We've been over this. She's moved out on you. The county's given her a flat. The county ...? The county doesn't just give flats away. She's sick in the head, that's what she is. Tell her I'll forgive her, if she comes home tomorrow. She's not coming home, Dad. She's moved ! I have to speak with her. Where is she living? I can't tell you. I've promised Mother not to ... There's always been something sick going on between you two. He's a real nut case. Ow! Jesus Christ! - Hello? - It's the home medical service. Does an "Esther" live here? It's time now ... Food ... food! Food, god dammit! He has such a one-track mind, that it makes me sick. All his greasy food and beer and filthy clothes ... - You have to tell him you've moved. - I have, but he's totally senile. That's why I waited till he got that room. Why should he move into a rest home? He's strong as an ox. You've got to see this bruise he gave me. Yes, take a look ... How about that? That's a man who can make his point! He's a crazy Swede. He was just pissed off. You've got to persuade him to take that room, before he loses it. She must have had a horrible time. I never understood why he didn't care when Mom tried to commit suicide. Has she tried to commit suicide? Yeah ... no. She said she was going to. She locked herself in the bathroom with all her pills - - and just sat there and waited. That's completely crazy. In front of her own children? - What about you, Svend? - We'll never get that way. - No, we won't. - No. Then it's better ... to say "nice knowing you", and get divorced. Yes. If I had to do without you, I'd die. You won't. I'll never, ever leave you. But if you leave me ... If you leave me ... ... I'll just follow you. You're so dumb. I won't. I won't leave you. Careful! Easy ... Careful. 0h, yeah, like that! Hi, Torben, what's up? What's that? This? This is for Lizzie's birthday. It's a real man's drink. - Want a taste? - God, no. I don't touch that shit. You're not much of a man, Svend. You've got to grow up. I'll try. One can only do his best. - I'm looking for my father. - Kaj saw him this morning. He accuses all of us of stealing from him. People don't like that. How much does he owe? My mother's left him. He's completely out of it. Be glad you've never experienced that. You can't get dumped without a girlfriend. That's dumb. You should get yourself a girlfriend. No! E ... E ... Esther? - Is it you? - How's it going, Dad? Like hell ... I don't get any food. - I want to get out of here. - Damn it! Then you can all go to hell. I'm giving up the flat. Dad, listen ... Why don't we just take a look at the room in that rest home. I'm not a Jew! I'm not going to a concentration camp! No way! I'd rather starve to death. You won't starve. They're experts at taking care of people and making food. Their kitchen's fantastic. Excuse me, but I reserve the right to have my doubts. You shouldn't be in doubt. They're experts. You want a beer, just call. And bang! It's standing in front of you. - That's more than Mother can offer. - It's not that which she has to offer! - On time, you said? - You can set your watch by it. You can furnish it as you like. It looks very nice. What do you say, Dad? You're your own boss. You can come and go as you please. But we're very strict about the meals. What did you say? The part about the meals? The meals are served at eight, at one, and six. Always on the dot. On the other hand, there's plenty. Bølle ... When the hell is he coming to visit me? He's my son, too. He's really busy. He has a lot to do, so he'll come when ... - I'm sure he'll come ... - I don't know how long it's been ... He wasn't very big then, was he? Isn't it true? Is he still living in Copenhagen? How the hell can such a weakling manage that? He lives on the outskirts, so ... - What the hell are you doing?! - Excuse me. Not when you're shooting my Harley! Bølle! You're fucking not going to shoot my Harley, man! God dammit! You know Mother's sorry she never sees you, don't you? They're your parents. You won't see your child and wife either. - Is everybody so terrible? - No. Right now, it's only you. Sure, it's great that you have all those friends in the National Guard. Dad's changed. You haven't seen him in, I don't know how long. He doesn't drink at all. It's time to think positive, and let the past lie. - Nothing's changed. - If I can change, so can you! - I can't. How can you?! - Because I ... Take a look around you. Don't you think it's time to get on with it? You've got to get out! Breathe some air! Get laid! You need to get laid, man. If he comes here ... I'll kill him. Everything all right? That wasn't too cool, was it, boys? - It was just a little nose bleed. - He must have fallen. - You ordered 2 drinks a half hour ago. - More than a half hour. It's because that dirty whore doesn't know how to serve. You couldn't know it's my girlfriend you're talking about. You be polite. Girlfriend? She was shoving her ass in that jerk's crotch. While we were thirsty as hell. Thirsty as hell? You should have just said so. You want to hit my girl?! Hey ... Easy, Svend. Get out. Now. - Hey, that's my gun. - Out! You're not getting away with this. If she's your girlfriend, he shouldn't ... Shut up, and get out! What happened? Shit! That big, fat clown! When talking to a psycho like that you shouldn't be staring at me. Strange, you threw a drink at him, unless ... He's lying! - Unless I wasn't supposed to hear! - Boy, are you dumb. - Did he grab your ass? Did he? - Didn't I just say he's full of shit? Who was the guy with the bloody nose? An average customer, like all the others. - You're sure nice to them. - Is it against the law to be nice? How many drinks do you think I could I sell if I was a cranky bitch? You're there to sell drinks, not yourself. - Svend Johansson? - Yeah. This way. Who is he? Just confess. I'll find out anyway. He's one of my old friends. He's gay. Why didn't you say it? Why do you always have to lie?! If I'm to sew this up, you have to lie still. Yeah. Sorry. Have you had sex? - Didn't I just say he was gay? - Yeah, yeah ... Gay? That's no guarantee. Have you had sex? "One mustn't, under any circumstances, be unfaithful ... ... except for ... ... threesomes or foursomes, where both parties give their consent." When I lived in Copenhagen, I owned the whole "pissoir". I was really ... I was the happiest man in the world. I ... I lost everything. Now it's gone. - It's still there ... - No, it's not. - Yes, it ... - No. Yes, it's still a street in Copenhagen ... 0ops! What the hell ... Give it one on the snout. My life has been like that flatfish's for the last forty years. A little flat, huh? Nope ... Nature is the only thing one can trust. It takes care of itself. She lives in the new apartment complex, right? Come on. Answer me, Svend ... If you can't trust your old father - - who can you trust? Huh? It's 57 Diamantvænget. Pretty fancy. This is great! This is living! 0h, this is good. I really like riding motorcycles. We can take another ride. Okay? A trip to Copenhagen ... Good. That's fine. Fine, fine. Bølle ... When is he coming to visit me? We could surprise him, couldn't we? We'll ride out there, just you and I. Then I'll show the two of you Copenhagen. Louis' Wine Bar is dead, along with all the girls. We've got to celebrate ... What's the matter with you? There he stood. Staring straight up at my windows. Then he rang the bell. I thought I was going to die. How has he found my flat? I don't understand. He'll come back when he's drunk enough. I know him. - I'll protect you, Mother. - Yes, Svend. Esther? Esther ... I know you're home. Give me the money! Don't worry, I'll get hold of you, understand? You're still my wife! I really want to thank you for your help the other evening. I've never touched your girlfriend. And I never will, okay? I'd rather flirt a little with you. Lizzie, did you have sex? Yes, on one occasion. Ten years ago. How ... was it? It was strange. He held me really tight. And then he fucked me like crazy ... In the ass. Yeah ... Did he? And he could just do that? No asking first? He's not exactly the type who asks permission. He could ask first. I mean ... in the ass! Well, Svend. Sometimes I like to be swept off my feet. Without a lot of small talk. "One must never be unfaithful, except for threesomes or foursomes - - where both parties give their consent. You can be with girls, and I promise not to touch them. Nor men, either. All other forms of sex are allowed, so long as it's not kept secret ..." Why can't you touch other girls, if I can? - You said you like girls. - But you do, too. I don't feel like it. I only want you. "If one party suspects infidelity, he has the right to a full investigation. If evidence of infidelity is found ... ... the relationship is definitively and completely over." We must never end up like my parents. If you can sign this, I'm your guy, one hundred percent ... forever. What's the difference between these rules, and how it was before? If you sign, you commit yourself. You don't know a fucking thing about love. I wrote these rules because I love you. That's a hell of a strange way to show it. I'm afraid to keep living here. Here, take a look ... I'm going to buy you a charter tour to Mallorca. You can relax for a whole week with sun, palm trees, and everything. Meanwhile, I'll explain to Dad you don't owe him money. I've never touched his money. He thinks everyone is stealing from him. But I'll take care of it. - A trip like that costs a lot. - I've got lots of money. Don't worry. Think positive. Think about the good things life has to offer. - Lizzie must have spilled the beans. - Not Lizzie, she's my girlfriend. He'll come back when he's drunk enough. I know him. I'll take care of it, Mother. See? It looks completely normal. Unbelievable, Svend! Fantastic! Where are we going? - Where's your ticket? - The ticket's for Mother. Shouldn't we have talked about this first? We're broke, and you buy your mother a vacation? She's going to have a breakdown. They're always having nervous breakdowns - - but when it has to do with me, you don't give a shit! - Where the hell are you going? - To Torben, down at the bodega. You haven't said anything to me about it. I met him the other day. He said he'd be glad to celebrate my birthday. I'm sorry, Lizzie. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just been such a mess with my folks ... Don't cry. I promise ... No, listen ... - I love you, darling. - You forgot my birthday. No, darling, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Listen ... - Bastard! - I know. I'm an idiot. Listen. I'm going to see Dad. I'll be back in three minutes, and then we'll party ... Okay? - You better be quick. - You bet I'll hurry. All this damn running around ... Can't a body have some peace? I thought you might like an evening beer. Shut up and sit down. The music ... Just listen to this music. "Why Is Happiness So Capricious?" They always played that one at Louis' Wine Bar. What about our trip to Copenhagen with Bølle? - Damn, that's right ... - Is it going to happen soon? It's just my motorcycle. I have to repair it first. Happy birthday to you ... Yes, I know. Listen, baby ... - A half hour and I'm there, darling. - Just hurry up. Happy ... Cheers. - I don't really like this kind. - Cheers, I said. Don't be such a damn sissy. The hell with it. Cheers, old chap! Down the hatch. - Wow! Thank you! It's beautiful. - Watch out, it's strong. I'm ready for anything. Come on. Cheers! Yes ... Hello ...? - It's Lizzie. Give me Svend. - He's sleeping. He's sleeping?! Yes. He'll be out a long time. No ... He's snoring worse than Esther. Are you already awake? I'm sorry about yesterday. I'd put sleeping pills in Dad's beer and the beers got switched. It doesn't matter. Silly boy. I'm so sorry I got so angry with you yesterday. I don't understand why you're asking. Lizzie's not the type. No, no. She just said she'd met a guy who had a good job for me, that's all. I'd watch out with a job like that. Unless you want a sore ass. - Why? - He's a faggot. 0h, yeah ... So it's Gunnar. - But they left together? - Yeah ... I think they did. 0r ... I don't actually know. I didn't really notice. Can't you be a little precise for once? Just for once. Forgive me. It's only me. I'm sorry to disturb you like this. I don't have time, and I don't owe you money. It's not the money. Please just give me two minutes. It's bad timing. I was just leaving. - It's nice here, it's nice ... - It's how I always wanted to live. You can have a seat on the sofa. I probably won't be able to afford things like this at the rest home. I can see you've packed a suitcase. Svend has given me a vacation. I'm going to Mallorca. I'm looking forward to it. I'm on my way to the airport. Who are you traveling with? Alone. I would like you not to come here anymore. - No. - No. I've left you, you know. But you must have come here for a reason. It's unbelievable - - but it didn't need any alterations. Still fits perfectly. - Isn't that your wedding suit? - Yes. Precisely. I'm just a little tired ... Karl, wake up. I have to leave now. - Beer! - There's no beer here! Get up. You've got to go now. Do you hear me? - Food. I want food! - You neither eat here nor live here. I said food! You damn sow! - You can have some food. - Give me food and shut up, bitch! Maybe he's the one you're not traveling with. That's the man who won't leave my flat. Easy, easy! Good-bye, Karl. I hope we never see each other again! Did you have sex? Who were you sitting with when you came back from the toilet? - With Bente. - Bent? I said "Bente"! - But I sat next to Pernille. - So you didn't sit next to Bente. - Pernille? - Yeah, that's what I said. - What time did you leave? - You've asked me a million times. Just answer me, if you've nothing to hide. A little before three, I think. Shouldn't I just answer the phone? I think it's the discotheque. I'm going to wind up getting fired. That last beer you say you drank. Who was that with? - If you hesitate, you're lying. - With Torben, god fucking dammit! I can't accept that. You said it was Knud before. - I don't feel like answering more ... - You will answer until I'm satisfied. 0h, what's this? It's a contract you've signed: "If there's a reasonable suspicion..." I have a million reasons to be ... No more fucking questions! 0r you could try it with Bente again, or Knud or the Russian or ... One last time. Who did you drink that last beer with? - You're not doing that. - Who?! You didn't do that! You're fucking insane! - 0pen that door! - No. - 0pen that door now! - I don't ever want to see that again! I'll never come out again. Never! Get out, you prick! Go away, I hate you! - I hate you. - 0pen the door!! I've had enough ... Svend ...? Hi, Svend. I'd been looking forward to seeing you again. I wouldn't, if I were you. Must I be here? If it's something between the three of you ... I can understand. No one wants to defend someone spreading filth. I asked you to come. I need your help, and you came. That's nice. - Now we're singing a different tune. - Do you think this is for fun?! Would you like a drink? - Lizzie says you had kinky sex. - I've never said that! - Right here. - I never said it! - You have! - Shut up! You stay here! Come back here now, Lizzie! You two just stay put! If you go now, it's over, because then the door's closed! Don't worry, I'll stay away - - because you're nothing but a bunch of stupid rules! Take your gun and shoot yourself, because I don't give a shit! - Thanks for the ride. - You're welcome. The hotel was so clean. Everything was so beautiful. And the sun shone from the clearest of blue skies. What do you think of this? Look. What do you say? I'll talk with Dad, okay? You don't have to. I'll never get rid of him anyway. Go away! Hear me?! What the hell are you doing? - Why'd you block the door? - They want me to take a bath. It wouldn't hurt. No, but they only want me to, because they know what I'm hiding. - Why's the money around your cock? - I thought they'd never look there. It's the money for our motorcycle trip. If it ever happens ... We've got to talk about something else first. Right, Dad? 0h? What's that? Mother just came home. Do you realize how unhappy that made her? Give her pills. Commit her. You're the one who should be committed! You're sick in the head! I should have known. I knew that trip was never going to happen. Would you take this money and hide it in the lamp up there? Dad ... Why do you keep tormenting her like that? I thought so. I always knew it. There's always been something sick going on between you two. I'll do it myself. There's a solution for everything. You're not crawling up there. I've danced on plenty of tables in my time, so just ... If you want to kill yourself, go ahead, but I'm not watching! Well, thanks for the help. And thanks for the trip! It's the thigh bone. A little chip has broken off. Broken? Then he'll have to have a cast. You can't put him in a cast. Karl will be fine again soon. He can take some Pinex and codeine, and he has to be mobilized. - Mobilized? - So he can function like before. - He'll be staying here? - No, it's better if he comes home. - Home? - Get well soon, Karl. He doesn't have a home. I'm sorry, Dad ... Maybe it's because ... Lizzie's left me. Hey, Russian? - Hi, Svend. - Hi, Torben. I have a question for you. Wrong answer, and I blow off your kneecap. - Got it? - Okay. Last time we met, you said - - my girlfriend had something going with a faggot who grabbed her ass. - Is that correct? - No, not at all. - He didn't grab her ass? - No, I made it up. - It was for fun. - You made it up? - It was for fun. Just for fun. - Are you sure? - Yes. She'd never do that. - I don't believe you. - Don't move that leg. - Stop that! - Stop it! No! No! - Are you crazy, Svend?! Stop! What the hell are you doing?! Give me that. Give me the gun. Give it to me! You want to go to jail? Is that what you want? Didn't I say I wouldn't have any back-pay in here? Didn't I? - What the hell are you doing?! - I'm sorry, Torben. You're sick in the head. I asked her 4 times who she drank the last beer with and got 4 answers. "Torben" ... and "Knud" ... And the last time, she said she drank the last beer with ... ... with "Bente". - She's such a liar. - Forget about it. If you love her ... I can't love a woman who cheats on me, Dad. Hi, partner. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby. There's nothing wrong with you. It's me, I know. I'm sorry. I don't know what happens to me. I get crazy in the head. I can't live without you. I can't. I love you, baby. I love you. Is your Dad any better? He's been given some medicine. There's something I have to ask. That evening, when Gunnar was knocked down ... Was there any truth in it? What are you talking about?! - Just a question. - You're insane! Fuck off! - It was just a question. - I'm working now. Get out! - Get out! - What's the hell's your problem?! What the hell is he doing with her? He should be whacked. Now you go to the bar and say I just fucked you. This is just so he gets enough fluids. I thought ... He doesn't drink anything. He doesn't eat, either. I tried to get some fluids in him. But ... he just sleeps all the time. It must be the medicine ... I can't reach him. Look at him ... He's ill. Can't you see that? He has to be hospitalized. There's secretion in the lungs. It was good that you brought him in. I'll make some tests and give you a drip if you need medicine later. We'll take an ECG. Afterwards, we'll do some blood tests. You're good at that. I guess you've done it a few times. Thanks, it's my work. I'm sure you're good at yours, too. Torben's a bartender. The king of drink makers. Really? I love drinks. Strong ones. Okay, drinks ... Especially the strong ones. Yep. I'll have to come and taste them one day. The doctor will be here in a moment. - Bye-bye. - Bye. What is it? You should have invited her to taste you drinks. - Especially the strong ones. - Jesus, I was just talking with her. - Is it Bølle...? - No, it's me, Dad. I was sure ... it was Bølle. You're in the hospital now, Dad. Say to Bølle ... ... that I care a lot for him ... I just ... didn't dare show it. - Do you think he can forgive me? - Yes, of course. I wanted so much to go back to the "pissoir" again ... But, no matter how hard I tried ... ... I never succeeded. I'll take you back. That's a promise. Dad ...? Fuck ... 0h, man ... This isn't happening. What the hell are you doing, Svend? I'm just trying to close his eyes, but they want to stay open. Jesus Christ ... We don't need a doctor now. Farewell, Dad ... See you later. You need a little bucking up. - Feeling down, little brother? - I think he's mad at me. He can't forgive me. You're the only one who ever cared about him. Why's it so dark? It's the clouds. It's like they're trying to strangle me. I know it sounds crazy, but it's like Karl is up there in them. Father and I should have made that trip together. There was something there I didn't know about ... in the "Pissoir". I don't like you saying that word. - It's just a part of town, Mother. - It's vulgar. I won't hear it again. Now that Karl's dead, it's gone. No, it's not. It meant everything to him. He said it just before ... Think of all that he destroyed with his awful beer and his tantrums. It was almost as if he killed Bølle. I'll never forgive him. Never. Do you need to speak with someone? I'd like to see my father. I was wondering if we could wheel him on a little walk. - "Wheel"? What do you mean? - Just in a wheelchair. - No, absolutely not. - He is my father, you know. Yes ... but he's dead. So he's my dead father. There's no difference. Don't you think so? May I have a few minutes alone? Yes, of course. I'll be right outside. Okay, Dad ... God, are you stiff. Torben, listen ... I need your help. I'm at the hospital with Dad. I need you to call the nurse we met. The one who was so nice, remember? I want you to invite her out. - Why? - Because I need more time. Why have you locked the door? - Can I have two more minutes? - You have to open that door now. I'm sorry, but I hide when I want to cry. - But I have to keep an eye ... - But then I can't hide. Telephone! It's important. Okay, you can have two more minutes. It's going fine ... Okay, Dad, hold on tight. We're going to have a real nice ride. You old fox ... The sun's shining out there. We did it, Dad. We fucking did it! Jesus, Daddy. You've got to hold on to me. Dad ...? Dad, are you there? - What's the matter with you? - What do you mean? Use the mats. What's wrong? Obsessed with cleanliness? I've invited a nice girl who'll be here soon, so behave, okay? A girl? You? Where'd you find her? At the hospital when Karl died. I called her and we talked, and ... I saw Svend riding with Karl this morning. I did! - Shut up, you drunk. I saw Karl die. - You're lying. - Are you accusing me of lying? - Yeah. I was there. I saw Karl die. - Hi, Torben. - Hi. Hi, Mom. Me and Dad are on our way to Copenhagen. Dad? ... But ... But are you okay? I'm great. We'll see Bølle, drive to the "Pissoir", have a beer and ... Someone's knocking. - As long as it's not Karl. - It's not. He's not running around. May we come inside? Svend? Sergeant Jensen. Where are you? We'll be back after we take care of a few things, okay? Did you say "we"? It's just me and Dad. Just a little trip. Nothing special. I want to know where you are. Now, Svend! See if they can trace his cell phone. Now they won't find us. I brought someone along for you to say hello to. He's leaving, so it's your last chance. I don't feel like saying hello to anybody. But you'll want to say hello to this guy. Come ... Dad, he's coming ... He would have preferred to say good-bye himself, but ... Bølle ... Bølle, give it a chance. The only thing I asked, was for you not to come here again. He created you. - I never had a father. - But you have me! I don't want you! You piss on me, sneaking him in here. It was the only thing I asked you not to do. Yes, but listen. Listen to me! I wouldn't come if it wasn't important. He loved you! I was there when he died. I sat there with the old bastard, and he said ... He just wanted you to forgive him. It's been twenty years, for god's sake. You can forgive him. God, is he ugly. What good does this do me? He never came. No, Svend ... No. We don't need a wheelchair, do we Daddy? No problem. Let's find a seat for you ... How about by the window? Let's take the helmet off ... There ... The light's pretty bright. It's good we've got some sun glasses here. Like that ... One Carlsberg, coming up. May I have a Carlsberg and an orange soda? No, not cold. Room temperature for the old man. One doesn't drink ice-cold red wine, either. Nay ... It's all going downhill. Do you have that song, an old one. I can't remember ... Something with "happiness". "Happiness is ..." - He loves that one. - Why is happiness so capricious ... Well, do you like the music? You can still hold a beer bottle. So ... Here we are. It's going fine. ... the one who you think likes you, perhaps is going to leave you and all that he promised and swore is forgotten Why is happiness so capricious ... 0h, Daddy. ... and he, whom you love why does he leave? Maybe you should have a cigar. Cheers, Daddy. Cheers for the "Pissoir" ... ... wherever the hell it is. Huh ...? What is it that's there? It was in order to lure people inside. It was packed here every Saturday. Swing music ... The winning couple got free drinks all week. That couple won all the time. Several years in a row. Let me show this to my father. Well, Dad ... I'd like an explanation. Your mother called me. What the hell are you doing? We're just having a talk. Well ... I do most of the talking. You're wanted by the police. I heard it on the radio. What's your plan? Actually, I was just going to take this trip with Dad, but look at this ... It's your mom and dad. But see how they look. It doesn't make sense. Yes it does. They were in love. Dad couldn't stand her. He only wanted to come back to the "Pissoir". Maybe he meant another ... "pissoir". - There is no other "Pissoir". - No, but ... I promised your mom not to tell, but "pissoir" is what your father called ... It was the word your dad used for your mother's ... Your mother's ... Down there, you know. That was pretty strange, to call it a "pissoir". Yes, but it's because he was jealous. If "pissoir" was Mother's ... ... then I've really been on a wild goose chase. Mother! Mother ...? 0pen the door! - What the hell are you doing? - I don't like you to swear. - No, and I don't like you to lie. - Lie? I've never told a lie. Lizzie told me about the "pissoir". You can't trust her. I've always said that. Mother, don't lock that door! If you're so wicked, you'll never see me again. You're not doing this anymore, god dammit! All your pills and threats. It's over. Finished. Understand? You take this picture, and you take a long, hard look. Look at it. Your eyes have to be open, Mom. He sure looks great like that, doesn't he?

And then came ... lie after lie ... ... and revenge. 0h no, now they're coming to arrest him. No, it's okay. The trip's over, anyway. Look at him. He's a king. I'd better go down. See you later, Mother. If they'd just been honest - - and said what they meant, things would have been much better. There's no reason to be honest if you're punished for it. That's why ... people have to forgive each other. That's the point. People have to forgive each other. I fucked Gunnar. What ... What did you say? I fucked Gunnar. Svend, I'm sorry ... I'm sorry. Can't you remember you said if I left you, you'd just follow me? Svend, take it easy. Svend, stop! It's flooding!
