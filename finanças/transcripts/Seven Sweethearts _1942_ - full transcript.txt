Shh! Sounds beautiful, no? Too beautiful for words, so I won't say anything. We are just practicing. Wait till you hear us at the festival. Wait a minute. What, eh... What festival? Our festival, the tulip festival of little delph. You know, I've been over the whole map of Michigan with a magnifying glass, looking for this burg. You are a tulip fancier. Well, no, no, not exactly. No, I'm a newspaperman... a reporter... well, that is, sort of a reporter. I take pictures and put a story around it. You will love it here. No tulips anywhere like ours in little delph. Well, that's fine, and I almost drove right through. Say, why aren't there any signs around here? Anybody can tell it's little delph. How? How? By our tulips, of course. They have, instead of 6 filaments, only 4. Only 4... I guess I counted wrong. You come from new Amsterdam. No. No, New York. That is what they call it now, but when we founded it, we called it new Amsterdam. A dutchman. How did you know? I counted your filaments. Eh. Ha ha ha! Good morning, Mr. Van Maaster. Hello, Martin. How are you? Excuse me, but can you tell me, uh, is there a hotel in this town? Yes, the house of seven tulips. A very fine hotel. Well, uh, do you suppose I'll be able to get a room there? Why don't you ask the proprietor? Oh, you're the, uh... yes, I am the house of the seven tulips. Why isn't there any sign out in front here? How does anyone know this is a hotel? I am always out in front. Oh, I see. They take one look at you, and they know it's a hotel, huh? No, but they ask me, and if I want them to stay, I tell them. Ah. And if you don't want them to stay? Ha ha ha! I just play dumb. Ha ha ha! I see. Well, you make yourself very clear. No, no, my boy. Don't go away. Stay right here. I like you. We have a nice room for you, one I think might work. Victor, an arrival. Welcome, sir. I'm Victor, the manager. From where I stand, you look a little more like Victoria. What can I do for you, sir? Quite a lot, I should think. Uh, look, what time are you through work here tonight? Any requests like that you'd better take up with father. The old dutchman is your... oh. Well, for the time being, I guess I'll just settle for a room. Looking on the lake or the square? It doesn't make any difference. I'm only staying here a couple of days. That's what they all say. Miss Robbins over there came for the weekend. She's been here 15 years. 15 years? George, a room on the second floor for this gentleman. How do you do, sir? Oh, you're, uh... George, huh? Yes, sir. May I have your name, please? Yes, uh, Henry Taggart, or should I make it henrietta? Room 23, sir. Don't you serve any keys with your rooms? Oh, you won't need one. Our guests don't lock their doors. Peter? Take this gentleman to 23. Right away. How do you do, sir? Peter, huh? Yes, sir. You know, where I come from, they have a very strange custom, Peter. All the girls have girls' names, Peter. Yes, sir. This thing ever get stuck between floors? Oh, no, sir, don't let that bother you. Doesn't bother me a bit. Room 23 is the second door to the left. Your luggage will be right up, sir. Oh, wait a minute. I forgot something. I forgot to ask the price of my room. You can discuss that when you leave. If you don't mind, I'd rather do that now. I don't want any arguments later on. There are never any arguments in our hotel. Hello, Mr. Randall. Lovely day. Yes. I'm so glad, and how are you? Fine, thank you, Mr. Randall. Oh, I'm so glad. So glad. Uh, good-bye. Good-bye, Mr. Randall. I take it that was Mr. Randall. Yes. He's in room 28... musician from Vienna. We were speaking of arguments. Take him, for instance. He hasn't paid his bill in over a year, but no one ever mentions it. Now I know why he's so glad. Oh, I... I beg your pardon, but can you please tell me, how do you get room service around here? I've got a piano in there and a flock of birds, but no, uh, no phone, not even a bell. Oh, there are no phones or bells in this hotel. Isn't it enchanting? Enchanting. No worries, no cares, free from everything, like a leaf in the wind. Good-bye. You put things so beautifully, darling. I could listen to you for hours. Uh... Look, are those people all right? Why, yes, sir. They're the nugents. They're on their honeymoon. Oh. Ha ha ha! Then of course it's enchanting. Oh, you're the, uh, bellboy, eh? Yes, sir. My name's Cornelius. Do you always deliver the mail to the room in person? Why, certainly, sir. Well, I'll send myself a letter right away. I beg your pardon? Uh, get me a waiter, will you, please? Very well, sir. Male or female? I beg your pardon? I thought so. All right, come in. I'm Albert, the waiter. I'm minnie, the moocher. Get me some lunch. What shall it be, sir? Black coffee. And? And hurry. Well, what about your lunch? What about my coffee? Well, coffee's no lunch. Coffee contains no calories, no nourishment... that's right, and I want a large cup of it. But, sir! At this hour, your system needs substantial food. Albert, let's not go into my system, please. All I want is just a simple cup of coffee. Father says people never think about their health... no breakfast, no lunch, just a light dinner, and what happens eventually? They get the jitters. You know, just listening to you gives me the jitters, Albert. You see, you admit it. You need nourishment. Now today for lunch, we have chicken fricassee, spare ribs with Sauerkraut, hutspot maclapsduch... that's soup meat and very nourishing... and rundelapa with onions and Ollie Bolen... that's nice fried dumplings and... all right, all right. Forget it, forget it. I don't want anything. I don't want any Ollie Bolen, I don't want any hot spot maclobbenslaughter, and I don't want any coffee. Well, I'm glad you agree with me on that. Then all you want is the rundelapa with onions. Is that it? Get out of here, or I'll... if you were a gentleman, you wouldn't talk like that. If you were a real Albert, I'd bust you right in the nose. Here I ask a simple question, and all I get's a lot of rumul-lap-me doubletalk. Spare ribs, calories, nourishment, father... a guy can go mad in a p... you shouldn't get excited like that, sir. I can get just as ex... but you shouldn't. Look, sir, when you get angry, just give your ear a tug. Our minister taught me this, and it'll calm you down right away. This? That's it. Thanks. I'll probably need it around here. What goes on here, anyway? Everybody on the staff looks like miss America, and the proprietor plays the oboe. Oh, that's father. He's good, isn't he? Oh, you're a daughter, too, huh? Uh-huh. Are you the youngest? That's right. My name is Billie. Billie, eh? Billie, Victor, Cornelius. What in the... well, how did you all get boys' names? Well, father always wanted boys, and so he named us before we were born, and when we turned out to be girls, we were just stuck with the names, you see? Uh-huh. Yes, sure. That makes a lot of sense, and this is where I have to wind up, tripping through the tulips when everywhere else in the world, history is being made. Fine newspaperman. What a life. Maybe life would be better with a little less history. Philosophy... Now that's all I need. # soft gentle breezes at play # # the doggone breeze is played... # that's enough of that. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, now. What's enough of what? Can't you hear that that's perfectly terrible? It's awful. I n... i never... I know, it's just a cheap radio. Maybe you'd squawk, too, if you only cost 11 bucks. I mean the music. That's Mozart's cradle song, and they're making a jazz number out of it. If Mozart had wanted it that way, he would have written it that way in the first place. Mozart or no Mozart, that is my radio, and I like the way they play it, and if you don't... listen to that, all cluttered up with syncopation. Such a beautiful song, too. Boogie-woogie... # there is a dreamboat on high # # sailing each night through the sky # # soft gentle breezes at play # # send it along on its way # # just make a wish on a star # # ahhh # and though your dreamboat is far # # ahhh # it will come sailing to you # # then all your dreams will come true # # ahhh... # ahhh... You're not through by any chance, are you? Oh, no, now comes the second chorus. No, that's all right. That's all right. I get the general idea. I'm sorry I bothered you, sir. I promise it won't happen again. Oh, now, that's all right. Stick around. I... I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Matter of fact, it was ok, your singing. I like it. Thank you. Well, I'd like to hear more sometime. Oh. No, no, I-I don't mean a second chorus. No, you see, I have to do this story on the festival here, and I need some pictures. You know, outdoor stuff with a pretty girl in the foreground, smelling a tulip. Tulips don't smell. They don't, huh? I'll make a note of that. How about this pretty girl? Do you suppose Albert or Cornelius or one of them could give me a hand to help me out? You'd better take a look at my oldest sister. She'd be just right for it. Which one is she? The desk clerk? The manager? No, you haven't seen her yet. There's another one? Oh, yes, sure, the seventh tulip, huh? All right, swell. Tell her I'd like to get started this afternoon. This afternoon? You can't get any pictures this afternoon. It's going to rain. Yeah, I know that. Wh... what? It's not raining. No, but it soon will be. Look... Our tulips belong to the species of the tulip vigesnariana, and they always tell us the weather. When the petals are closed, like this, it's a sure sign it's going to rain. It's ridiculous. It can't rain. Look, I've got to get my pictures. Come on, do something. Get those petals open! I'm afraid it's going to start any minute. There it is. That does it. Oh, I wouldn't worry too much about it, sir. The rain can't possibly last for more than 2 or 3 days. 2 or 3 days? Well, 4 at the outside. 4 days?! You'd better pull your ear, sir. I'm trapped. I am trapped! I'm trapped. I'm trapped. Come here, my boy. Come here. I can tell you a few things for your story. Come sit down. Well, at least that'll be something. Ok, toots, shoot. You see, our bulbs are all from... from Holland, I know that. And they are very sensitive. Sensitive... must have expert handling. Be sure to mention that. American readers ought to know the trouble we go through to bring them all this beauty. I suppose before you dutch came to this country, America had nothing but weeds, huh? Oh, I wouldn't say that. There were a few cactuses, too. All right, toots, you win. Go ahead. What? I say you win, toots. Now about the rain... Please, tell me what... what is this you call me? Did I call you something, toots? Oh, oh, "toots." What... what does it mean? Well, uh... You see, when I'm very fond of anyone, I always call them toots. Ha ha ha! Is that it? Fine! Ha ha ha! Thank you. This rain is a real gift from heaven. Without it, the stems of our tulips might have been half an inch too short. Half an inch... I'm trapped. I'm trapped. George, what do people do around here for entertainment? Doesn't anyone have any fun? Thanks for the cards. I mean, anyone else? Oh, there'll be plenty of entertainment around here tomorrow night. Haven't you heard of our weekly socials? Oh, yes, who hasn't? That's what's been killing the nightclub business in New York. Young man? If you really want some entertainment, come to my room. Miss Robbins. I'll show you my collection of pressed flowers. Oh, well, that's very sweet of you, but, uh, maybe later. Right now I've got to go over the papers. Cornelius? Will you please get me the newspapers? There aren't any today. No papers? No. They never print when it rains. Well, I never heard of... would you please tell me why they don't print when it rains? Well, what good would it do if they can't get anyone to deliver them? I'm trapped. I'm trapped. Hello. Come here, my boy. I know just the thing to cheer you up. I will show you my egg trick. Your what? My egg trick. Look here. I have a bag, and I have an egg. It's... it's wood, wood. I shall make the egg disappear just like that. I... yeah. Here you see an ordinary black bag. The bag is vacant. You mean empty. All right, the vacant bag is empty. Don't make me nervous. Now i... i... i... yes. I put the egg in the vacant bag and say the magic words, buche, buche, buche! Nothing here and nothing here. Buche, buche. Nah? You tell me, where is the egg? No, no, you tell me. Ha ha ha! Nowheres but in miss Robbins' basket. There is the egg. # lum pa la bum bum miss Robbins, do you mind? Buche, buche, buche. Lift the egg up, buche, buche. Buche, buche, buche. Here it is. Whew! Whew! Must be a mistake. Oy oy oy... Miss Robbins, you haven't... no, I haven't, and you know it. I've been here for the last 15 years, and every day of that time, he's been trying to do that trick. Miss Robbins, please... if I were running a hotel, I wouldn't waste my time on such silliness. As long as I am the proprietor of this hotel, I run it my way. It's outrageous, a man with 7 daughters and such childish ideas. Miss Robbins, if you don't like it here, you can move out any time you want. I will decide when I'll move. You're Mr. Taggart, aren't you? The gentleman in room 23. Why, yes, I am. What room are you in? I'm on the third floor. My sister Billie told me you wanted to see me. Oh, yes, and you're the, uh... the oldest daughter. Well, young man, are you ready to come and see my pressed flowers now? I doubt, miss Robbins, if Mr. Taggart would be interested. I asked him, not you. And I'm answering for him, if you don't mind. You're always answering things you're not asked. Now, now, now, girls, girls, let's not quarrel about this. What's the matter? What is it? As usual, miss Robbins is interfering. If I were her mother, I would do a great deal more than that. You are not her mother, miss Robbins, and I must ask you once and for all to stop picking on Regina. As long as I am the proprietor of this... yes, yes, yes, I know the rest of that speech. Good day. Good day. Good day. Thank you, papa. I hope we're taking good care of Mr. Taggart. Yes, I-I think he's satisfied, only a little upset about the rain. Oh, no, not at all, not at all. Nothing like a good rain, I always say. Why, without it, the stems of our tulips might have been half an inch too short. Think of it. You have a very attractive daughter, Mr. Van Maaster. Thank you. Be a lamb, will you, papa, and get us some liqueur? Let me see. I think I feel like some creme d'amour. Of course, my dear. Albert? Albert? You like creme d'amour, don't you, Henry? You don't mind if I call you Henry, do you? Well, yes and no. Yes, I like anything with amour in it, and no, I don't mind if you call me Henry. Oh, thanks, Al. The name is Albert, sir. There I am, wrong again. Oh, no, sir, the customer is always right, but the name is still Albert. A votre sante. A votre who? Oh, ha ha ha! Oui, oui. So you're a newspaperman, Henry. Yes, but I'm awfully good to my mother. And you have many connections, I suppose... the theater, producers, Broadway, et cetera. Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. I'm very well known among the et cetera. What I mean is, the theater and the press, we naturally work very closely together, you know. How delightful that we should meet. Mmm. No sooner met, but they looked. No sooner looked, but they loved. No sooner loved, but they sighed. How is that? Shakespeare, as you like it, act 5, scene 2. Oh, you're an actress. I am much more than that. I am a personality. For instance, when I walk on a stage and just do that... What happens? They melt. Uh-huh. Uh, have you ever been on the stage? Never. Well, how do you know they'll melt when you just, uh... Do this? How do I know? I've seen how they look at me wherever I go. Everyone here is terribly in love with me. Well, what goes for little delph goes for Broadway, too, is that it? What's the difference? All the world's a stage, and its idol is the woman who doesn't play, doesn't act, but simply is what she is. Shakespeare. The beginning... the rest is from me. Rain, rain, rain. Let's go for a ride. In the... Rain, rain, rain? There's a town near here. It's not a very big town, but at least it's a town. Oh, papa, Mr. Taggart has asked me to go for a drive with him. Would you send someone up for my coat and my periwinkle scarf? For your what, darling? And my periwinkle scarf, it's on the dresser, next to lord Byron's collected works. You will have it in a minute. Billie? Billie. Billie, Billie, Billie! Billie, Regina is going out. Run up and get her coat and her scarf. It's next to the works of lord periwinkle. But, father, does she have to go? Of course. Mr. Taggart invited her. Well, I thought... I was just hoping that she would stay here this afternoon and take my place. You see, I have to have my costume fitted, or it won't be ready for the festival. Can't you wear last year's? You looked very nice. She'll look a lot nicer in her new one. She's going to her fitting, and miss Regina is going to stay here. That beats the dutch! My own cook is giving orders to me? You are fired, Petunia, positively fired! Fired, hired. Mr. Van Maaster, one time you are going to fire me one time too much. No more arguments. Pfft. Huh? Huh? But, father... you can have another afternoon off. You will... you will get your costume somehow. A guest wishes Regina to go driving with him, and you know the first rule of our house... miss Regina's always right. Yes... no, the customer is always right! Don't make me crazy. But, father... but, father, look, it was the same last week and the week before. I haven't had a day off in... in... All right. I'll get her things. Buche, buche, buche. It's 10:00. He's supposed to be drowsy by now. I'll get him drowsy for you. Mr. Randall, let him have it. Which one of you is closing up tonight? I am, father. When Regina comes in, be sure she gets her glass of buttermilk. Yes, sir. And be sure you... you put out the lights. Yes, sir. And good night, boys. Good night. Buche, buche. Good night. Good night. Well, she's out rather late, our Sarah bernhardt, isn't she? Any objections, miss Robbins? No, but if I were running this place... miss Robbins, as long as I am running this hotel, I run it my way! That's the trouble with it. Once and for all, miss Robbins, I must ask you not to interfere! All right. Yell as loud as you want to... Gee, they finally left. I didn't think they'd ever leave. You know, every night for two years, we've been stuck here with a soda. We won't have to wait much longer. We think it's gonna work this time. Why this time? Don't tell me Regina's found someone. You know that newspaper reporter that came here this morning. She's been out with him for hours. Boys, this is it. Oh, you should have seen the look she was giving him all afternoon. And you should have seen him. Huh! He was a hooked fish before she even got him out, so by now he must really... well, just a minute. Who was a what before who got who out? Act your age, Billie. You know what it means if Regina lands him. Look, if it doesn't work this time, we'll be embroidering tulips the rest of our lives. I see. A fine thing. You want her to grab just anybody who comes along so you can can get married. Well, we didn't invent the tradition that the oldest daughter has to be married first. I'll close up for you, Billie. I want to find out where we stand. You go to bed. It's my turn, and I'm going to stay. Hooked fish? How can you say that? What if he isn't even interested? Or maybe he's married. Why, I never thought of that. Maybe he is. You should have asked him when he checked in, George. Well, it didn't occur to me. He started flirting right away. Oh, then he must be married. Someday I'm gonna tell that hard-headed old dutchman that he's still living in another century, and I'm gonna go right... ahem! Gentlemen, when a man says good night, he doesn't mean hello. Good night, Mr. Van Maaster. Good night, sir. Good night. Good night, Mr. Van Maaster. Quick, quick. Quick. Quick. Now, now. # mmm mmm hmm mmm # remember Vienna, the biergarten tenor # # the concert in the park # # troubles were fewer # the blue danube bluer # and life then was a lark # # suddenly came a new step # and the goose step wasn't heard # # Vienna # let a tear drop # you could hear drop # round the world # it was waltz time in Vienna # # wine was flowing, hearts were gay # # broken is the wine glass # # only memories live today # # Vienna may be through # # but Strauss and schubert cannot die # # 3 things live forever # # you and the waltz and I # # 'twas waltz time in Vienna # # wine was flowing, hearts were gay # # broken is the wine glass # only memories live today # Vienna may be through # but Strauss and schubert cannot die # # 3 things live forever # you and the waltz and I # I like your song, Mr. Randall. Oh, thank you. Must have been lovely there before the... yes. Before they came along, people were gay and carefree. Homesick? No. Not when you sing, miss Billie. Excuse me. May I take you up? Oh, that's all right, Billie. We'll take the stairs. We're having a little dispute about the steps. I say there are 22. But, dearest, you're wrong. There are 21. 3, 4, 5, 6... sweet, you're wrong already. That's 5. But, dearest, it's 6. 7, 8, 9... It's wonderful, isn't it? Every evening they look for something to argue about so they have an excuse to make up. Yes. It must be nice to be as happy as that, but what I wanted to say is... of course, only if it's all right with you. Yes, Mr. Randall? Good night. Good night. Hello, Billie. Hello. So the producer of the show asked me to take a look at a dress rehearsal, and I did. Hello, Billie. Hello. Afterwards, I says to him, "Oscar," I said, "there's only one thing to do." You called him Oscar? Oh, yeah, sure. He called me Hank. I says, "Oscar, you got to postpone your opening, "throw out your first act, change your second, and open with your third act." Did he do it? It was a smash, two years. He must be terribly grateful to you, Henry. Well, sure he is. So whenever I find a girl I like, I just say to him, "Max..." I thought it was Oscar. Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Well, anyway, he's very grateful, you know. How interesting. Billie, take this away. The galoshes, too, dear. Now, Henry, let's "make the coming hour o'erflow with joy, and pleasure drown the brim." I beg your pardon. Act 2, scene 4... I've forgotten which play. Here's your buttermilk. Don't disturb us, dear. You drink it yourself. Henry, Henry, you don't know what you've done for me. I can almost see my opening night on Broadway when the final curtain falls and the applause summons me. Of course, I'll change for the curtain speech. I'll come out in a completely new gown. Well, uh, what, uh, what will you say? I have it all prepared. There I'll stand, a single spotlight on me. Uh-huh. Then, when everything is silent... drink this. Father said so. Billie, please. Well, uh, you... you'll say what now? Ladies and gentlemen... go to bed. Go to bed... uh, oh! Are you still here, dear? Yes. Someone has to close up. It's late. Cute, isn't she? All right, Henry, "good night, good night..." good night. There's more coming. "Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night, till it be morrow." Good night. Oh, sir. Just a second. Yeah? Are you married? Are you talking to me? Yes, sir. Ha ha. That's a funny question to ask. Anyway, the answer is no. Well, are you planning to get married? The answer is still no. Oh, that's bad. Good night. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Now, what's bad about it? I feel fine. Well, I was just thinking of father. Who? Toots? He doesn't want to marry me, does he? Oh, please be serious, sir. I'm worried. Yes. I can see you are, but why? Well, it's... Look, sir. We're 7 sisters and... no, I better talk to you about it some other time. Now, what is all this? Come on, now. Get it off your mind. Well, I-I know it must sound pretty forward, but Regina told you about wanting to be on the stage, is that right? You know all about it, don't you? Well, every time someone comes here from a big city, her imagination runs a little wild. Now, that's not such a wild idea, to want to be an actress, is it? But she mustn't go. She's father's pet, all he cares for in life. He has 6 other daughters, hasn't he? He could easily forget all of us, but if she goes, it will break his heart. You see... Regina is the exact image of mother. That's the reason she must stay with him. Now, that, uh, that doesn't fit in very well with her ideas, does it? She wouldn't be happy in New York. You can't dig up a bulb and transplant it to a new soil just like that. It would rot. Good evening. Good evening. Well, it's really getting late. I don't want to take up any more of your time, but you will promise me you won't encourage her too much? It would do her a lot of harm, and I'm sure it doesn't make any difference to you. You take love for granted, don't you? What if I really liked her? If I thought you did, I-I wouldn't have brought this up. I don't know why, but somehow I felt I could speak to you freely. Yeah, sure you did. After all, we have a lot in common, you and I. Yes. Mozart and... this. Then you will think about it, won't you? What I said about transplanting bulbs? About what? Transplanting bulbs. Bulbs. Yes. Sure. Well, thank you. Good night. Oh, oh, Billie... yes? You know, I told you I had to take some pictures for my paper, remember? Yes, sir. Well, you'll be the girl in the foreground, Billie. Thank you. Well? He's not the marrying type. # little tingle tangle toes # # there she goes on her toes # # followed by a dozen beaus # # in their wooden shoes # like a dancing daffodil # # on a dutch windowsill # how can little feet be still # in their wooden shoes? # singing to a concertina in her peasant clothes # # she looks something in between # # a tulip and a Rose # now if you want a real dutch treat # # wouldn't you like to meet # little tingle tangle toes # in her wooden shoes? # hi diddle-Dee dum dum # all the boys and girls were there # # hi diddle-Dee dum dum # dancing round the square # little tingle tangle toes # there she goes # on her toes # followed by a dozen beaus # in their wooden shoes # like a dancing daffodil # on a dutch windowsill # how can little feet be still in their wooden shoes? # # singing to a concertina # in her peasant clothes # she looks something in between # # a tulip and a Rose # ha ha ha ha ha # ha ha ha ha ha # ha ha ha ha ha # ha ha ha ha ha # ha aah aah ohh # bluer than...

I'm keeping it for a surprise. I have finally mastered it. No. Well, let me be the first to congratulate you. Thank you, toots. Ha ha ha! Good? Anyone I am very fond of, I call toots, also. I know, I know. You are looking for Regina. Unfortunately, she can't join you. She's upstairs with a bad cold. Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Poor girl. I'm sure she will appreciate your sympathy. As a matter of fact, she waited for you to call on her all day. Oh, well, I didn't want to intrude, and I'm not going to. Oh... oh, what I mean is, the best cure for a cold is to be completely alone. You tell that she must stay in her room... by no means come down here tonight. I... i... i will tell her, but that leaves you alone, too. Oh, that's perfectly all right. I'll just sit right over there. Ok, toots. Ha ha ha! Good? # la la la la Lee # good evening, sir. Would you care to order now? Now, that was a swell song. This time it was exactly as Mozart wrote it. Even I could tell that. Well, that's very kind of you to say it, but that song wasn't written by Mozart. It was written by Mr. Randall. It was? Well, Mozart's to be congratulated. Won't you sit down, huh? I, um, I'm here to take your order. What will it be, chicken broth or tomato soup? Well, which are you gonna have? I, well... well, you're having dinner with me, aren't you? Please, sir. I have other people to serve, too. Don't be concerned about me in the slightest, miss Billie. I can wait. There, you see? He's annoyed. Well, of course he's annoyed. You're not treating me right. I'll be back when you've made up your mind. Hello, young man. Oh, hello, miss Robbins. It's a lovely evening, isn't it? I'll let you know later. Ho ho! Have you made up your mind? Yes. Definitely. Won't you... what will it be? You. This morning when I got up, I found this suit all pressed. Now, you wouldn't know how that happened, would you? Well, I didn't want you coming to our social all wrinkled up. How did you know I was coming to your social? I had, uh, hoped you were coming. You had really? What I meant was that i... you don't have to explain. Now I know why I came. Please, sir, what will it be, chicken broth or tomato soup? I won't eat a thing if I have to sit alone. Toots. Toots. Toots. I have good news for you. Those nice words you sent her made her feel better. Wonderful. Boys, please, stop smoking. It might be bad for Regina's cold. All right. Here she is. Sorry to have kept you waiting, Henry. We'll have the tomato soup, dear. What, no trumpets? Not here now! I will go and turn on some heat. We can't take any chances on her. Ha, toots! # la la la I'm delighted to see you, Reggie. Really, you should have stayed upstairs. That's what my doctor said to me, too, but, of course, he exaggerates. He's terribly in love with me. Here we go again. Now, look, Reggie. You've got to be reasonable. You're a sick girl. Look at your eyes. They're all watery. But not from the cold. I've been crying. Why? Because of you, Henry. I need you. That's what I've always needed, someone who'd be concerned about me, about my health, about my career, about my whole life. Oh, what was the name of that producer who's such a good friend of yours? Uh, which one are you referring to? The one who made a star of that girl you recommended. Oh, him. Well, uh... Well, this isn't the place to talk about things like that, Reggie. I see. You want to be alone with me. No. No. Now, I didn't say anything like that. All right, Henry. I'll go with you. We'll take another drive. Now, wait a minute. You'll get pneumonia. Did Camille let that stop her? Who? Camille. Don't you know what she said before she died? I didn't even know she was sick. She was sick in body and soul, and she died for love. Now, look, Reggie. All this about you and Camille is... all right, if you'd really like to go, I'll be delighted to take you. I tell you what you do, Reggie. You, uh, go upstairs and put on some warm clothes, and then I'll be getting the car out, see? "What shall I do with all the days and hours "that must be counted ere I see thy face? How shall I charge the intervals..." Yeah, well, that... that's all right. You go right on, and I'll, uh, I'll honk for you. Just a little more. Oh, I was just bringing your soup, Mr. Taggart. I'll have my dinner served in my car. In your... in my car. But, sir, it's pouring. I can't serve you out there. I never heard of such a thing. Will you please remind the young lady the first rule of the house is, "the customer is always right"? No, I ordered the tomato soup. Oh, no. You ordered chicken broth. Obviously you weren't listening. Mr. Taggart, I positively remember you ordered chicken broth. No, no. Tomato soup. I remember because I wrote it down on my pad. Well, we're not getting anywhere this way. Come on, now, let's talk this thing over. Mr. Taggart, you're making a lot of trouble for me. How am I going to explain why I disappeared like this? Well, just tell them I got fed up with the rain and wanted to leave, and you had to bring me back, that's all. I'm sorry, but in little delph, we're not accustomed to lying. Besides, I'm getting drenched. Now, if you moved over here a little closer, you wouldn't, see? I suppose that's how my sister managed yesterday. Your sister? Which sister are you talking about? You know very well which sister. Oh, her, well, I forgot to tell you about that. You see, she stepped out of an elevator last night and right out of my life. Well, if that's so, then I'm terribly grateful for the change in your attitude. Now please take me home. You know, Billie, everything about you is wonderful. It's fine. The way you hold your hand up to keep the rain out, the way you pull your ear when you get mad, and especially the way you say bulbs. Please say bulbs. I'll never say bulbs, Mr. Taggart. Not Mr. Taggart... Henry. And I can't go around calling our guests by their first names. Imagine calling miss Robbins abagail. I know, but I'm not just an ordinary guest, or am I? Hmm? Please take me home, Mr. Taggart. What's my father going to say about all this? Please, Henry. # we gather together # to ask the lord's blessing # he chastens and hastens # his will to make known # the wicked oppressing # cease them from distressing # sing praises to his name # he forgets not his own # we all do extol thee # thou leader in battle # and pray that thou still our defender will be # # let thy congregation # let thy congregation # # let thy congregation escape tribulation # # the lord make us free # lord, make us free # lord, make us free Henry, it's i... Regina. Come in. I have your breakfast here. How dare you say, "come in." Well, bust my garters. Miss Regina has gone to work. Ha ha ha! Petunia, you are fired. Fired by the daughter and fired by the father. I'm the all-firedest woman in the whole town. Hello, reverend. Please, for a moment. This is Henry Taggart, the young man who is going to tell the world about our tulips. Oh. How are you, sir? This is our reverend Howgan. You'll excuse me. I must be off. Surely. Good-bye, toots. Hello. Hello... hello, toots. He's toots, too, huh? They are all tootses. Say, look. I've got to run up and get my camera and go to work, but, um... Don't you think I'll need someone to explain this festival business to me... you know, why you all dress up in dutch costumes and go to church on Saturday and things like that? That's the opening ceremony. It's always on the first Saturday in may. Oh, you see, I'll need someone. Now, um, one of your daughters would be perfect for that. Billie, for example. Mr. Taggart, I shall assist you. You, miss Robbins? Mm-hmm. I know the ceremonies better than any of these natives. Oh, well, no. I... I couldn't ask you to do that. Of course we couldn't. I'll show you around, Henry. It's very kind of you, miss Robbins, but it would be much too strenuous. After all, a woman your age... Well, what's wrong with her age? I think she looks wonderful. As a matter of fact, miss Robbins, I never saw you look younger. Quote. Come on. She can't get away with that, papa. I won't have it. It was nice of her to help out a little. Miss Robbins, thanks a lot for getting me out of that, and now if you'll excuse me, I want to... no. You stay right here. Get your pencil and notebook. Oh, now, look. You didn't think I was serious... let's get to work. The festival starts as soon as the out-of-town visitors arrive. That's what all these brooms and buckets are for. What are they going to do with them? Give the visitors a bath? No. They're for the scrubbing of the pavement. It's a dutch tradition 500 years old. Tradition 500 years old. And then we have the wooden shoe dance with the prettiest girls in town. Maybe I better get a pair of those wooden shoes right away, huh? No men are allowed in the dance. That's another tradition... 800 years old. 800. All right. That's fine, miss Robbins. I'm sure you'll excuse me if i... there's some more information. No, thanks. I don't need any more. I got all I need. Well, maybe you don't, but I do. Young man, I want to have a talk with you about Billie. About Billie? What... what about her? I heard her singing in church this morning. Huh. Just a beautiful voice, isn't it? I've known that beautiful voice ever since its first squall, and I can always sense what's behind it. I can imagine what was behind the first squall, but, uh, what do you think it was this morning? She's in love. How could you tell? From the tremolo. The tremolo, huh? Well, could you by any chance tell with whom she's in love? Unfortunately, you. I knew that the moment she went off key. Miss Robbins, I could kiss you. I understand that's your specialty. Yeah, well, I'll see you later... stick to the subject. What are your intentions towards Billie? Well, I had thought of telling that directly to her. Well, you're going to tell me first. Now look, miss Robbins, isn't it enough that I have to go through this with that stubborn father of hers? Do I have to take it up with all the guests in the hotel? I'm gonna marry her. Why is it that you've never married before? Possibly because I haven't found the right girl. And what makes you so sure that you've found her this time? The mere fact that I allow myself to stand here playing 20 questions with a withered, old pressed flower like you. What did you say I am? A withered, old pressed flower, and that is final. I think he's all right, girls. What do you think? He's ok by us, miss Robbins. We'll take him. He has my ok. With Petunia, it's posilutely. Ha ha ha! Well, were... were you all in on this? Sure, and now, Henry, you may kiss me. Oh, abagail. Sorry. Excuse me. Oh, uh, how are you today? Wonderful. Wonderful, huh? # it's tulip time, tulip time, time to be gay # # it's tulip time, tulip time, come out to play # # love is in the air, everywhere life is so fine # # come one, come all, it's tulip time # # hearts young and tender # this is the time to surrender # # dance to the gay and romantic waltz # # joy will be yours when the music halts # # love will not miss you # while there are two lips to kiss you # # it's a gay holiday, all the world's in rhyme # # fa la la la la la la la la, tulip time # Oh, how are you? Hold this for me, will you, please? Don't you think this is going a little too far? I'm supposed to be dancing. What if somebody sees us? Here? Come on. No one's gonna see us here. Sit down. Oh, be careful. Don't crush the tulips. They're father's most valuable prize specimens. Oh, not these. You. You're impossible, rain or shine, Mr. Taggart. Now, miss Van Maaster, are we back at that? We always were. You don't have to pretend anymore. I know everything. Tremolo. You've been talking to miss Robbins. Abagail? Sure, she told me. Wait a minute, Billie. Can't you get it through that funny, little dutch head of yours that I'm in love with you? And I want to take you to New York with me. You don't understand, Henry. What I told you about Regina goes for me, too. We're country girls who belong here. Do you think the world is gonna stand still if one of you moves out? Father's world... definitely. Oh, no, Billie. Look, your father's world is nothing but that egg trick and buche buche and a smile from Regina. You know that. You told me so yourself. Perhaps I said too much. He's just as concerned about all of us. Well, of course he is. That's why he'll understand when I go up to him and I'll say, "look, toots. I'm in love with your daughter, "and she's in love with me, and... and then when you tell him that you picked one of his prize specimens, he'll take you right in his arms. Ha ha ha! Oh, I can fix that. That's simple. No, it isn't simple. Henry, for generations there's been a tradition in our family that the oldest girl marry first. I can't be the one to break that tradition. Traditions. I'll show you a real one. This one's a million years old. In fact, it's the oldest tradition in the world. I can't... I can't do it. This tie... The black one? I wore the black one. Looking for someone, Regina? Anyone in particular, dearest? No, and don't ask me questions. I dislike it intensely. All right, your royal highness. Where's Billie? I thought you weren't looking for anyone. I asked Cornelius. Don't ask her questions. She dislikes it intensely. Thank you very much. That's all I wanted to know. Oh, boy. Something tells me we're going to have a little relative trouble. I'm sure of it. This darn tie! Oh! Billie, Billie, where are you? Victor, George, Albert, Cornelius! Pssh. On a day like this, they all leave me alone with my tie. Slowly. Slowly. Slow. Slow. Ha ha ha! Father's room is over there. What, oh, the one on the right, eh? Good luck. Yeah. You be sure and keep your fingers crossed for me. All right. Ha ha ha! I've got to change for the concert now. Mr. Taggart. Just a second. I forgot to give you back your camera. Oh. Anytime you're in a spot like that, I'll be glad to hold your piano for you. Thank you very much. Oh, come on, now. Cheer up. It doesn't have to be Billie. What about Regina? No matter what you say, she's still a Van Maaster. Oh, how could I ever dare to look at her? She belongs to the world. Well, the shape the world's in now, maybe she'll want to make a change. See you later. You are going in to propose? Yeah. Yeah. How do I look? You'd better be careful how you approach him. Don't just go in and say it right out. Oh, you mean the direct approach is no good, huh? Billie? Billie? Billie? Oh, it's you, my boy. I was calling for my girls, but, of course, they are never around when I need them. Is there anything I can do for you, Mr. Van Maaster? Maybe you can help me with this tie. Why, sure, I'll be glad to, Mr. Van Maaster. Come on. I wait for Billie. I wait for Victor. I wait for George. All right. Just step over here. All my girls. All my... all right. Now just hold your head up for a minute. Please, please. That's it. Now just... no, I think maybe I can do it better around here, Mr. Van Maaster. What's the matter? Don't you like me anymore? Well, sure I do. What... what makes you think I don't? You don't call me "toots." Why? Oh, yeah. Sure. Toots. No, I think you're swell. I think you're great. As a matter of fact, that's the reason I came up here. Yes? What's the matter? Well, uh, you see, I'd like very much if you'd do me a favor. Uh-huh. Well, the paper I work for would appreciate it very much if they could get a picture of you. Pic... picture of me? Yeah, well, after all, no story on tulip time would be complete without one. Now I had in mind something with the egg and the vacant bag. You know? Ha ha ha! I will change back to my costume. No, no, no. That's not necessary. No. Just the way you are is fine. As you wish it. Here is the egg, and here is the bag. I suggest that you pick out a certain point to look at. Then I be looking into the camera? No. That's too direct, and the direct approach is not so good, I hear. No, just look anywhere. Look up there at that picture. That's fine. That's my wedding picture. Oh, it is, really? Gee, that's swell. All right. Now that's perfect. Just as you are now. Now... now, you'll have to hold very still because this is gonna be a time exposure, and the important thing is to keep smiling. Oh, that's it. That... that's fine. Now don't forget. Keep smiling no matter what I say. All right, and now... and now you are going to tell me you want to marry my daughter. Well... How... How did you happen to know that? Buche buche. Mr. Van Maaster. Toots, well, is... is it ok? If she likes you, it's all right with me. You know I have no other wish in life but to make my child happy. Wait. I will get her. No, she's, uh... she's out there. No, no. She's in here. No, no. She's out there. Here he is. I am the proudest man in the world. Henry, I have told her everything. She's yours. Now wait just a minute. So you finally declared yourself, darling. My son, my son. Your son? Now listen, Regina... you don't have to say anything, dearest. We know how you feel. This fixes everything. Henry will be with us here at the hotel. We will all be one big, happy family, and we are not going to tell anyone till after the festival. This shall be a festival... no, look... darling. I know. I know. I know. I know. You want to be alone. You have a lot to say to each other. Yes, we certainly have. I am the proudest man in the world. Ha ha ha! You've made him very happy, Henry. I hope he's as happy when he finds out he's picked the wrong tulip. You know, I came here to ask him for Billie. All right. You're in love with Billie. It's a little beyond me, but I won't interfere with it. On the contrary, after I'm settled in New York and if this love is still in bloom, there's no reason why you can't send for her. After you're settled in new... may I ask how you got there? You took me, Henry. How else can I meet your producer friends? Oh, now look, Reggie. I don't know any producers. You might as well know, I just talked big because... Well, it was a rainy afternoon, and your eyes were so beautiful when you listened... I see. You looked into my beautiful eyes and fell for my sister. Well, I just didn't think that old producer routine still worked. Girls don't go for that stuff nowadays. I thought. Henry, don't try to belittle yourself. You're going to take me to New York and start me on my career. Where are you going? I'm gonna have a talk with your father, and this time, there will be no misunderstanding. I wouldn't do that if I were you, Henry. If I don't go, Billie can't go, either. I have some influence with papa. You know that. Now just for the fun of it, how do you think all this is gonna work out? It's simple. We're leaving right now. Right now, huh? Well, that's, uh... that's not bad. That's not a bad idea at all. Well, if we're going, well, let's go. Now I'll tell you what we'll do. You go and get your things packed, and I'll be down getting the car out, and then I'll honk for you when I'm ready. Henry. You're not going to let me down this time. I only mention it because once before you said you'd honk, remember? Ha ha ha! What a memory. You're gonna be a great Camille. Ha ha ha! Thank you. I'll only be a minute. All right. Come on, now. We got to get some action here. You check my car and make sure there's plenty of gas. Run up and pack my things. You get Billie's stuff together. Make sure that driveway is clear out there. Honey, look, you run out on the square and keep your father occupied. This is one disappearing act I don't want him to see. Henry. Henry, what's happening? Billie, I'll explain it all to you in the car. Now come on. We've got to hurry. But I-I don't understand. Well, it's very simple. Your father has me engaged to Regina, and she expects me to take her to New York. That's why we've got to get out of here. Now we'll drive straight to a justice of the peace. We'll get married, and we'll be on our way to New York. Without saying anything to father? Not even as much as good-bye. I can't do that. Well, then, she'll wreck everything for us, Billie. She's promised me that. And that's one promise she sure will keep. You've got to go. We'll take care of father. Just go. How can I leave father and the house I was born in without saying good-bye? It's against everything we've ever believed in. I just can't do it. Just a minute, my child. Perhaps this is no place for me to be talking, but I've got to do it. You see, I love this house... This family... Yes, even your father, but times change, and, oh, people often neglect to change with them. Go, Billie. Go before it's too late. I feel I have a right to talk to you this way because if your mother were alive, I know she'd say the same thing. That sister of yours is apt to do anything. Regina wouldn't do anything against me. I'll go right up and talk to her now. Well, I'll go with you. I'm coming, too. If anything's cooking, I got to be there. No. No, you stay here, please. Girls, girls, you come with me. This is a matter we have to settle among ourselves. What's going on here? What do you want? Regina, there's never been much contact between you and me, but this is a big day in our town. Why don't we try to make it a big day between us, too? Why not? But do we need the audience? Yes. It concerns all of us. My doctor can't wait forever, and the men in this town don't like to have a bachelor treating their wives. This is our chance to break with tradition. A little revolution, eh? Nothing of the sort, Regina, but apparently Henry didn't make himself quite clear. You see, we're in love. He told me that, and I promised him we'd send for you later. You don't believe that one yourself. I made a deal with him, and I'll stick to it. You can't make a deal out of my life. I'm not going to give him up, and the same goes for him. You might just as well unpack. This is my chance. If it's your idea to get married, go ahead, get married whenever you like. Don't wait for me. I have other ideas. I don't care for tradition. I don't care for anything around here. I can't stand it another day, another hour. But, Regina, you're everything to father. If you walk out on him, it would kill him. Father. Father. That's all I hear morning, noon, and night... father. I'm going away whether father likes it or not. I'm sorry. I should have done this sooner. Yes, you should have. You'll regret it the rest of your life. No, she won't, because if she hadn't done it, I would've. You got what you deserved. Let's get this thing cleared up once and for all. If there's any more clearing up, we'll see that you clear up plenty. Billie! Billie where are you! Billie, I have been looking all over for you. It's time for your song. We are all waiting. The orchestra, the people... I'm ready, father. And you're coming with us, dear? No, I'd rather stay here. Uh-huh. Why didn't you finish your song? I couldn't, father. I really couldn't. I... i just... don't you feel well? I'm a little tired. Oh. Could I be excused for the rest of the evening? No, no. Come here. Sit down. Here, come here. I didn't want to ask any questions in front of Regina. You know how little it takes to upset her. What is it, father? What business did you girls have in Regina's room? Is it so unusual that we'd be there? For you, at least. You were supposed to be down here. We had something to talk about. What was it? Hmm? When bags are packed, someone wants to leave. Father... You don't believe that I was the one? I believe what I see. Then I won't say another word. All right. Then I will ask one of the other girls. They will tell me the truth. I'll tell you the truth, Mr. Van Maaster. I'm in love with Billie... And I'm gonna marry her and take her to New York with me. And that's that. Henry, Henry, you mustn't... no, no. Let him. I thought you were in love with Regina. That's where you made your mistake. Toots... this is the real thing with Billie and me. After all, she's your daughter, too, and I don't think you exactly dislike me. Just... just tell me. Is it the real sort... you and this young man? Yes, it is true, but we didn't... then what else is there to say? Nothing for us. It's all up to you. Why don't you be a good sport and give us your ok? A while ago, you were willing to take her without it. Why the formality all of a sudden? It seems you haven't been very happy here, Billie. I don't know why. I have done my best. I've tried to be a good father to all of you. You never had a better chance to show that than now. It has always been my principle not to hold anyone back who doesn't want to stay. Instead, I would prefer that you go im-immediately, just as you... just as you planned. Come on, Billie. I never saw a dutchman as dutch as that one. Billie... What's the matter? I can't go. You can't go? Well, there's nothing to stop you now. Henry, you don't understand. I can't go. You saw what it did to him. Oh, darling, he'll get over that. After all, we're not the first couple to ever elope, and he won't be the first father to forgive his daughter for it. I can't. Please go, Henry. You mean, uh... you want me to just walk out on you, is that it? What about you? I don't know. Can't think right now. You'll send me your paper, won't you? I'd like to read the things you do. Oh, I'm afraid you'll never find them. Guys like me don't get their names on their stories. I'd recognize them. Billie... I'll be hanged if I'll go without you. Father or no father, he has no... ok... but someday you're gonna break out of this family album. And when you do, you'll know where to find me, Billie. Not bad, those dutch dolls. You must've had a big time for yourself out there. Say, Henry, is this a gag? Don't you know about phones? You're supposed to answer them. Some dame's been pestering me all morning. Yes, miss Van Maaster. Here she is again. Hello, Billie? Bi... oh, how are you, Regina? Where are you, in New York? So you did it, huh? No, no, no. I understand. I understand perfectly. You want to see me. Oscar? Oscar... oh, that producer. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where you staying? The chesapeake. Broadway. Broadway... broadway. This is miss Van Maaster calling. I'm expecting a gentleman. When he comes, will you send him right up? Merci. Come in. The door is ajar. Good evening. Quite a machine, that elevator. Just whoosh! Hold the breath, 23rd floor. I think we should have one like that in little delph. The rate for this suite... $25 per day? This is as much we get for a week. Another improvement to remember. This new Amsterdam... when we dutch do something, we do it right. You might as well sit down for $25 a day. "When you read this, you will know why I left. "There's nothing in little delph for me. "Everything I want is here. You must understand me, papa." Pa-pa. It is papa. It was thoughtful of you to let me know so soon, by airmail, and I decided that such an important letter should be answered in person, so I came. I airmailed, too. You flew here, father? What's unusual about that? Wasn't there a dutchman before who did some flying? Now, about this wish of yours... to become an actress. You realize, my child, there was never one in our family. There were shipbuilders, preachers, innkeepers, painters, even a few pirates. So I suppose it's time we have an actress, too. You mean, you're not going to stand in my way? I have no right to stand in the way of my children's happiness. I have learned it. A little late, but not too late, I hope. If one of them wants to be an actress, then she will be one. Father. But she must be a good one. That's the point. Even our pirates were the best. I'll be great, father. You'll see. All I have to do is meet a few producers... now I'm not going to meet any of these producers. You are going to learn, my child. That's why I came here. You have... I shall see that you go to the best schools and get the finest teachers. Maybe it takes a year... maybe 2 or 3... doesn't matter. Do you really think that's absolutely necessary? Absolutely. It's a respectable profession. You have to learn it. All right, I'll learn, and I'll make good, too. Of course you will. After all, an audience won't be full of papas whom you can fool. You better get your things packed. I will help you. But why? You are going to move. But, papa, I don't want to move. It's very important for my career that I stay here. If you don't trust me, you might just as well get me a guardian. That you will get, too. Where are they? Come in! Come! Come! Come! Oh, how do you do, miss Regina? Abagail will be your guardian. I picked out a nice school. Efficient, hard work, strict regulations, and right across the street from the p.C.W.O. P.c.w.o.? What's that? Prudence club for women only. I lived there once myself. Isn't she wonderful? She will really be a second mother to you. I've been waiting for this a long time. She will handle all your personal matters. Money. Study hours. Other hours. Associations. Men. She will always be with you. Night and day. And the rest of the time, I'll be there. You, Mr. Randall? Yes. Hello? Who is it? Sure. Sure. Have him come up. Yes. Right away. The telephone in the room. We will have them, too, as soon as I get back. Abagail, these hotels are wonders. Come, let us sit. You, too, Mr. Randall. Come. Come. Henry, it's good you're here. I knew you wouldn't let me down. Take me away from here. You can do it. You must do it. I'll always be grateful. Now what play is that from? You've got the perfect setting for it. You know, you're really a knockout. Running away from home after Billie messes up her life and mine, too, covering up for you. Nothing could stop you. You had to run away, didn't you... she's run away? My daughter came with me. Well, I'll... a Van Maaster running away? The very idea. We are putting her in dramatic school. She will be a fine actress, one we will be proud to have in our family. Which reminds me... sit down, toots. Please. Toots, you have known me long enough to be ensured that my intentions are only the best. What I mean is... young man, I have the honor and privilege to ask for your hand for my daughter. Well, now, wait just a minute. Let's, uh... let's get it straight this time. Which one? Which one, huh? The tremolo. The tremolo? Oh, ha ha! Oh, papa! Now I have what I always wanted... a son. 7 daughters, and you, Henry... Henry the eighth. Dost thou, Martin, take this woman Victor to be your lawful wedded wife? Dost thou, Paul, take this woman George to be your lawful wedded wife? Dost thou, Bernard, take this woman Peter... wait... wait a minute. Here it is. I've got it. Here it is. I've got it. There are two more. There's the license. Just got it at the city hall. How did all this happen so soon? Did you ever spend a week at the prudence club for women only? Women? Yes! Dost thou, Carl, take this woman Regina? Dost thou, Martin, take this woman Victor? Dost thou, Paul, take this woman George? Oh, I mean... dost thou, Paul, this man... dost thou, George... dost thou, m-m-man... take this... Paul... I mean, dost thou, Martin, take this George... dost thou, man... this Paul... dost thou, uh, Billie... Dost thou, Carl, take this woman Regina? Dost thou, Martin, take this woman Victor? Dost thou, Paul, take this woman George? Dost thou, Bernard, take this woman Peter? Dost thou, Theodore, take this woman Albert? Dost thou, Anthony, take this woman Cornelius? Dost thou, Henry, take this woman Billie to be your lawful wedded wife? And I now pronounce you all man and wife. Captioning made possible by Turner entertainment group
