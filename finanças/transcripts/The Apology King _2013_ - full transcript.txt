"Dogeza" "Dogeza" "Dogeza" It is Japan's time-honored method of apology Placing one's forehead on the ground expresses complete surrender and gratitude to another Begging for forgiveness For example, a cell phone ringing during this film Sorry Not this one Sorry Or this one Sorry Criminal acts, such as recording inside a theater Making a flub at a public appearance Not really... A sudden exposure I mean, crappy movies like this end up with crappy premieres Getting annoying emails from the crappy director every night Such a crappy nuisance I'm so sorry! Ayako No... An affair - Don't go! - Sorry, it's work. - Work, you know? - Work? I'll call you, okay? Two-timing - You're late! - Sorry, it's work. No matter what the reason being late or otherwise As the method of apology that holds the greatest impact, "Dogeza" has been loved by the Japanese for a long time But actually... there is an ultimate method of apology even greater than the "Dogeza" In our industry, this is the "Super Dogeza" or the "Ultra Dogeza" or even the "Dogeza Horizon" Do you want to learn it? We want to know! Do you know? Do you? I don't know We want to know! I'd like to know Please! Tell us! Quickly, please! Yeah, I'd like to know - I'd like to know - I really don't care Unfortunately, it is something none of you can know Because once you attend a lecture from an expert apologist at our center, no matter what the trouble, no matter how bad the situation, through "Dogeza" actually... in some cases, Dogeza may even be rendered useless Before you consult a lawyer First, come to the Tokyo Apology Center Apologizing means no need for police For forgiveness, use "Dogeza" Be... Dogeza! ♪Tokyo ♪Apology ♪Center Case 1: Noriko Kuramochi Maybe I was raised leniently I've always been bad at apologizing Why'd you stop here? - Maybe cause I lived overseas as a child - Back up some! The "apologize first" way of thinking is deadly overseas Apologizing is the same as admitting your guilt and it puts you at a disadvantage in court What's this idiot doing? What the hell are you doing? Hot! You idiot! We're going to kill you! So even then when it was really my fault it was necessary It was 200% your fault I apologized...really When? At what point? Hey At the point where the driver of the Benz was going to pay the debt to the boss Anyway, sorry Huh?! Ouch! Way too late! That's what I thought Not just late, but you can't say "anyway" It's like you're saying you're not sorry And then? After that, I talked to a lawyer I'm Takahata, the Oiso family lawyer Please sign this contract I don't think you'll understand it and we're not taking questions so sign please What is it? You start working as a call girl in Osaka next week What!? Your professional name is...Noriko That's my real name You really didn't read this? He said I wouldn't understand it anyway You owe the Oiso family 4 million Yen 120,000 every month, with 30% interest every 10 days You signed it, so there's no way out This sucks - Sucks, sucks, sucks - No, don't... You're crumpling it You should have apologized quickly But, overseas... This isn't the US or Europe, it's Japan By the time you apologized, it was too late It should feel as though you apologized before you even hit them First, hit me with this What? Hit me with this S&M? Even if it was, do you think I'd ask for that now? No... Injuries are part of the masquerade of the apology Kuramochi-san, we don't have much time Why the shoulder? You need it on the face Without a mark, it doesn't mean anything! It's the "masquerade", you idiot! What? Who're you? I'm her brother Come on! Let's go! We're here... because my sister is sorry! Ah, you're head is injured Yes! On the way here, while passing a construction site, a steel beam... a steel beam fell! But, before anything else, I knew we had to come to see you My sister caused irreparable harm to your precious car... I beg your forgiveness! For Dogeza, speed is everything Within 39.62 seconds of appearing on the scene, The impact of the uncommon action of abasing oneself combined with a bloody face These elements all combine to form a sense of superiority in the other person Incidentally, according to records, Japan's first Dogeza can be seen in the Kofun Period's terracotta figures Brother, raise your head Raising it now would be too soon The boss said it, didn't he? Brother, first let's take care of that wound Then we can talk about it Now you can raise it Yes, sir Sorry, so sorry Mr. Kuroshima took it from here and came to an arrangement with the family Of course, all was not forgiven just because of the Dogeza Everyday, he arrived earlier than any of the gang members, cleaned the stairs and the bathrooms, helped the boss with his karaoke hobby, lit people's cigarettes... Please allow me Mr. Kuroshima! Coming! Please...there, there massaged the boss' shoulders helped the boss with his karaoke hobby, Even though I knew what it was, even I thought "does this guy want to join the Yakuza"? That's how dedicated his service was. It maintained their sense of superiority Repair costs for the car and including my medical bills it comes to 412,000 Yen but with our current sale it'll be 400,000 even That's higher than I thought What are you saying!? That's 1/10th what you owed! Put down the phone! If you don't pay 400,000 you're going to be sold off as a call girl! Sorry Can I make payments? Yes, so this is now null and void Ah, well... Is there anything I could help you out with? You? Actually, I'm hoping to become a legal clerk So this has been a good learning experience? I'd like to study more If I work with you, I'll get lots of experience You won't let me? I don't mind Really? Then... put this on Be Dogeza! ♪Tokyo ♪Apology ♪Center Cut...okay That was good Mr. Kuroshima Not this... This is not the experience I want Yeah, I know Then do the webpage Web? I don't have a webpage, so you can't search for "Dogeza" Is this what you want? Yeah, that's good Is your office around here? Office? The Tokyo Apology Center There isn't one None? Wow, if you search on "Dogeza", my face pops right up This is good! Thank you! What do you mean no office? Don't need one I just meet the clients, we apologize, and they are forgiven This address? Hmm? Oh, it's this restaurant Right, right? I'm not homeless I have a home, but I don't want to give out the address It's not very convincing if the one that does "Dogeza" lives in a mansion I've got responsibilities, you know I got an email A client, huh? Case 2: Takuya Numata Are you okay on time? Yeah, no worries I'm late! There was another accident and the trains were stopped Ah, there have been a lot lately Right? Yes? Since train accidents are acts of God being 30 minutes late is no big deal, right? I guess Sorry! Traffic was bad! Now how do you feel? Coming by car, you could predict bad traffic so I should have left the house earlier, right? That's right Therefore, it was the train Apologizing wholeheartedly even though it isn't one's fault evokes kindness in others and turns a minus into a plus Apologizing when unnecessary is very effective I'm Mr. Kuroshima of the Tokyo Apology Center How can I help you? So why were you late, really? I overslept How can I help you? How do I say it... A lawsuit? I'm being sued... I've been involved in a project called "Love Bra" and so I went there to headquarters to do some work on it I will explain how the new "Love Bra" memory cushion pad was developed Mr. Numata It'll be easier to understand if you compare it with the TR331 What? You didn't read my materials? No That's fine, I'll get them I was working with Misaki Ube, a cute, young lady We had a celebratory dinner after the presentation and at the after-party It was sorta free spirited It was getting really fun I don't really remember it well Apparently I did something to Miss Ube After that, she suddenly became cold Last weekend... You were sued for sexual harassment? I get it! What? Sorry, please continue He can't continue... what was that? What do you get? Earlier, it was just the two of us, right? How can I say this... I didn't feel safe Is it your eyes? Your mouth? Skin texture? Something dangerous He looks at me like I'm a sexual object Honestly, I don't even want to breathe the same air Hey! Sorry - You went too far - But I apologized But your apology was too late, you can't do that Now I can't look at him Nope... What kind of face is he making? No... I'm going to meet her and I want to apologize When I returned to the company I was summoned by the boss Howdy, howdy We've been kicked off the project Huh? I just got word that just the main office will handle it And you are being named in a lawsuit Hey! Did you already apologize? Miss Misaki, the chief is calling - I'm on my way - Understood Ya know, lately... I just kinda touched your ass, ya know? Sorta... My bad - That's not apologizing - Huh? First, don't say "ass" Even if you touched her, use "bottom" or "hips" Yeah, that's right... She's not a hostess Comparing her to a hostess is rude Even to the hostess, it's rude I've been so busy, I haven't even had a prostitute Hey, Mr. Numata! But I called one yesterday, so I'm good now Numata! But I touched Misaki's ass even when I was with other women. Numata! I understand it's not okay to touch any ass even when you're drunk Hey, NUMATA! Huh? You... You are good at making women's underwear Yeah, sure I guess at work I tend to look at women as tools Tools...or maybe flesh? If you hold this flesh here, then it becomes a C cup Balancing it with the ass Turn left Turn left Sorry you had to wait So, where we headed? What are you doing? Not like that If someone sees us, we pretend to be lovers since my boss ordered me, but touch me and I'll kill you! Yes, ma'am! First step of apologizing First, demonstrate your sincerity For example, the position from which you apologize Someone calling "taxi" versus running and sweating, which one shows sincerity? Ow! Run, Numata! I am Lift your legs Hey, speed up ♪Blizzard of cherry blossoms I see... So that's why the bloody face... That was because they were Yakuza Ultimately, Japanese love clichés Sincerity or heart They forgive the man that tries Are you okay? Shouldn't you go to a hospital? Next, listen to what the other person has to say Look in their eyes, listen closely, and make attentive noises This can wait, you should go to a hospital Mr. Numata Mr. Numata! What are you looking at? Basically, women are creatures that want you to lend an ear to their stories Hear out their complaints Just by fulfilling this desire, their anger will be halved You take me for an idiot It's not that... There's no point in arguing When people are angry, they don't listen at all There's a simple test to show how little they pay attention You didn't even read what I prepared for the presentation True Let's change "true" into something else "Frue" I asked you to look them over before the presentation "Frue" And during the meeting, don't play with your phone "Frue" And you made it seem like it was all your idea Aren't you embarrassed? "Frue" "Frue" That seems to be "frue" Not listening at all "Pascal" Now, how about this Basically, it's a matter of trust Yeah, "Pascal" With a docile expression, it really doesn't matter what you say Let's take a look I don't want to go to court for being groped "Rascal" But, it's annoying "Alaska, Alaska, Alaska" We're business partners, right? - "Pasta" - Even so... "Tom Jones" There's no trust "Tom Jones" You hurt me... What's "rascal"? Is that a racoon? When they finish venting Next, shower them with praise Huh? Isn't that a little shameless? Your skin is beautiful What? Um, well... Do you do something special? Some beauty secret No, just lotion That's all? Amazing... See? - Huh? - Shameless is fine 100% flattery Human beings love praise You've got an eye booger You're erotic Quite erotic, Ube... I bet the men can't leave you alone Erotic... If I got a call girl that looked like you, I wouldn't ask for a change Hello? That is not a compliment Huh? Huh? What? Mr. Numata, the word "erotic" is not a compliment Look at her face, does she look happy? Bring Along a Respected Person Appealing to the human fascination with strength or merit using someone that you know well, such as your boss or an elder, becomes an effective form of covering fire My father Erotic, huh? You sure are erotic... I bet men can't leave her alone, huh, Takuya? Erotic, this one... That is not "covering fire" You're just adding fuel to the fire I'm leaving, I've got nothing else to say I'll let my lawyer know what happened today Ah, wait, wait, wait... - Hold on - What? Here Here It's a Swiss watch worth 1,186,500 Yen Here Sacrifice of a Cherished Belonging If your sincerity is not conveyed through words and deeds you should give up an item you cherish to gain forgiveness I'm giving it to you, okay? Here you go, huh? Don't treat me like a fool Sorry for the wait Sorry, boss, it's been hard I know, right? All your advice completely backfired All his apologies just make it worse He has a gift for it Well said You piss me off! What now, boss? Boss? Boss? I'm listening... Take a break - Good work - Thanks Hey! White, huh? Cut it out! It's no big deal Yes it is! Are you listening? Put Numata on Hey Hey! Hello? Did you do Dogeza? Mr. Numata, did you? Are you Being Dogeza? I already did What? Dogeza didn't work? That's right Actually, The lawyer that the company is using for Miss Misaki is an old professor of mine from college Got it...explain it later Let me show you the preview room Masaomi Minowa passed the bar at age 26 then studied law at Columbia University and obtained his credentials He is acknowledged as an international lawyer that deals mainly with human rights No matter how small the issue, he will fight for it in court Basically, he's a giant pain Please have a seat That's a chair Can't you see the chair? Don't you see the chair? Do you hate chairs? Excuse me, it's been a long time Four years ago, I took one of your classes at West Tokyo University I'm Noriko Kuramochi It's 120% certain we won't settle out of court A little more, please? I'll be right there We've got to think of something besides apologizing That's not the way Boss I understand law so when he says 120% chance they won't forgive, it means we have to apologize 150% After all, we are the Tokyo Apology Center Here is your Darjeeling Tea This may be a tea shop so we are the Delicious Tea Apology Center! Apologize 150%... Is it possible? You may have already been forgiven Huh? Wanting to apologize basically means you want to be forgiven, right? There's no going back now I want to see this through to the end But, since there's a lawyer involved now, it has to be a great apology So, 150%, right? But I am not deterred I guess Let's do it Get up! Oh, right, sorry... This is a customer announcement Because of the recent accident lines 1 and 2 are both delayed There's been another jumper on the train Oh, it's on the news? There's been a lot lately Really? There's been a lot of them that lost their jobs? Is that really worth dying over? Just from being accused of sexual harassment Sorry, since I'm late, I'll just take a taxi Yeah, okay It is still uncertain when the train will arrive We will let you know as soon as we know when the train will restart She's headed your way Is that really worth dying over? Just from being accused of sexual harassment Numata Hello Huh? Huh? Did I fail? Didn't I just jump in front of a train? But I'm floating I'm floating, right? So I succeeded? Yeah I was fired for sexual harassment by the company I gave 20 years to Yeah You knew? I... overheard it just now... jumping in front of the train But actually, I really liked her So now I can't rest in peace What should I do? About what? Her house is really close by No, no, no! You can't go there! You're right, I guess she hates me that's why she sued me No, I'm sure it's not that She's still angry, right? No, she's not... - Really? - Really! I think she's already forgiven you Already... What? So, I didn't need to die? That's right! Dying over something as simple as sexual harassment I'm sure she regrets it So, rest in peace... Ah! Mr. Numata? Why are you here? Ah...no... You called me... I thought I would apologize I'm very sorry Ah, wait! Huh? Sorry, but, well... this may sound strange You want to get some tea? What? It's not like that! It's just that... I'm scared to be alone Just until the trains start back up Of course Shall we? Now that's apologizing 150% Did you really need that? I got a call from Misaki Ube and she's dropping the case Really? Mr. Numata? You're here? This is great, isn't it? We're settling it But what about the lawyer...Mr. Minowa? Don't worry about that Huh? Nothing Can I eat this curry? Go ahead Huh? You mix it like that? Yes He's here! Just now, the actor Elite Suspect Elite Minami's car has arrived at the South Shibuya Police Station On his way home, Minami got into an argument with a man in central Tokyo and assaulted him by kicking and beating It took the victim 3 weeks to recover from his injuries The South Shibuya Police arrested him for injurious assault The suspect is the eldest son of actor Tetsuro Nambu and actress Haruka Danno Case 3: Tetsuro Nambu and Haruka Danno Shall we begin? Waiter, ashtray please Ah, yes Our son, Elite, had an incident I know He has to give a public apology immediately - Yes, yes - What? Ah, sorry... I mean "wacha, wacha" Ah, it's you! I saw your show about the guy with cancer "Six Months to Live" That's it! It was called that, but ran for 3 years - What? - I'm Danno Haruka Danno! It's really you! But, you two... Split up Is that right? So we can't appear together - Right - The divorce lost me three commercials What's that got to do with this? It's a critical time for me, I've got to be careful Careful of what? That's your problem Next month, I've got a production starting Well, I've got a movie premiere in two weeks It doesn't matter, it'll bomb anyway If it does bomb, I won't have to pay alimony Well, you don't really know who is listening to you two When is the press conference? At 7 o'clock 7 o'clock... Today!? Okay, manager, if you would... Yes, yes Now we will begin the press conference Stop for a second Whaaaat? Who are you? My wife I'm Nami and I owe everything to him My last name became Minami after the wedding So forwards and backwards It's Nami Mi Nami Stop taking pictures! We met through a mutual friend and then we made it official in June but haven't made it public, so this is our chance... Next time, okay? She's young and beautiful so there'll be feelings of jealousy at what should be a public apology See, look how cold your ex-wife's eyes look... - I'm 22 - You're not listening! Same age as your son "Met through a mutual friend" A singles party, right? Just say that! Do it by yourself Okay, now do it again - Huh? - What? Nami? Nambu! Do it! Apologize! "Nambu"? I am here because my son, Elite has caused some trouble I am so... so very... truly sorry - Utter crap - What? Isn't "crap" too nice? Did you get hair plugs again? Don't talk about my hair! You can't tell... You can really see it in the back, sorta looks like... A burial mound? In a keyhole shape? On the contrary, his head's the only good part The unnatural look of his hair actually helps Paid attention to the camera, started crying from the start, Dragging voice, overstressed, overdone, short bow And that look at the end? Too staged? That's 7 points Score: 3/10 There's only an hour and a half Let's take a look at some footage that may help That's me... Yes, that's you It's from the show "Six Months to Live" This episode got great reviews Numbers through the roof! This is a bad one Huh? You killed my husband! It's my... responsibility I am so... so very sorry! Ahhhh.... - What? - It's the same Exactly the same He only has one method He does the exact same thing in the final episode Hey, whose side are you on? It's before your hair plugs You're right You can't tell Pause it! See there? Ahhhh... Just a coincidence Coincidence would mean you can't act His fake apology and real apology are the same I know, but he thinks it's cool No, no, no, no... He practices that look all the time in the mirror - You bastard! - Sorry! Mr. Nambu! Nambu! Nambu! "Nambu"? Mr. Nambu, Your go-to look doesn't have the persuasive power that you think Are you... dismissing my performance? You need to be reborn! Only 90 minutes... Show everyone a Tetsuro Nambu that no one has seen I will Write whatever you want! What... What was wrong with it? What? Ma'am...Noriko, you too You made eye contact with me just before the speech Yes That's when I completely relaxed and I could speak naturally You were too relaxed! Boss What was that? I thought I was watching Bob Hope I am here today cuz my son caused problems Sorry 'bout that It was harder than doing a role "Doing a role"? Was that a role to you? You're right After that, your bow... Yeah, you said 20 seconds Are you a child? How fast did you count? I couldn't help it! You kept talking about my hair! You're bald! Just accept it These days people are even shaving their heads Right, ma'am? Yeah, I guess so A length of 20 seconds... there's a reason for it We looked at the bows from apologies for celebrity scandals over the past 10 years, including their angle and length Counting up negative reviews, we arrive at the optimal apology duration For cases involving injury, from the upright position 100 degrees declination with head bowed 20 seconds Resulting in a minimal number of negative press reports I get it, but not really Even the angle of the bow... But when you stood up, what was that face? I'm not really sure It defies words... Defies words... The question-and-answer session afterwards was bad, too You kept saying "Victim A" over and over To victim A is an apology enough? It's Mr. A... Every time you drank water, your eyes crossed You held the microphone like a rapper You kept calling Chunichi Sports... Go ahead, Chunichi Spurts You sped through and then talked about your marriage Forwards and backwards It's Nami Mi Nami You spilled the water and took pains to hide your bald head That's enough! You spilled the water If you think it's so easy... Towel please... Got it If you think it's so easy, why don't you do it? No problem! I am here today because of my son's connection with a recent case, causing problems for everyone... I am so... terribly sorry 5, 6, 7, 8 They cut it short So how many seconds did she bow? 1 minute 50 seconds Better than too short, right? But the kimono is a bit much... The extravagance cancels out the apology My opera, "Princess Kaguya that rode on Apollo" still has seats available at Bunkamura for the midday shows You really got the plug in, huh? But the article, is this Tiny! To Chunichi Sports, calling them Chunichi Spurts was utterly deplorable But Mr. Nambu, that doesn't have anything to do with the apology After that, they had competing apology conferences, clarification conferences and apology conferences for their clarification conferences Although I said that my opera, "Princess Kaguya that rode on Apollo" had midday seats available, there are also some seats at evening shows Can you move a little closer? I don't want to lose any more commercials, so this is the closest You only have one commercial! No photos together, please What? That's all I'm sorry Hey! Wait a sec! I'm... I'm very sorry They repeated their apologies and explanations on blogs and Twitter No one even cares anymore that they are just going back and forth apologizing This is also part of Mr. Kuroshima's strategy What we call anger through time can morph into positive feelings The reason behind it all no longer matters Time helps cool things off and becomes the perfect chance for apology This perfect chance can also invite an unexpected problem We are at the South Shibuya Police Station It is 1:05 pm The suspect is coming out now! Are those sunglasses on his head? Sure are... Why are they on there? This is where he needs to bow Huh? There's something on his sweatshirt I'm scared to ask, but what's it mean? "Kill You Next Time" He's arrested for assault and announces murder Um, I'm... kinda sorry - "Kinda" - Did he say "kinda" 14, 15 Do you hear something? 17, 18, 19, 20 You can't count, absolutely can't! Yo! Good grief! It was finally coming together Ah, actually, I've been thinking... What? Why do they have to apologize in front of the camera? Huh? This whole thing has nothing to do with those of us watching TV They said they're sorry for causing trouble, but people actually enjoy it The one that really wants an apology... Is the victim, right? No, please don't bow to me I should be the one apologizing Huh? I see him getting bashed on TV and can't take it anymore But since I'm not a celebrity, no one will listen... Actually, I was pretty drunk that night Taxi! Taxi! Ouch! What was that? Run, Numata! I am Lift your legs Hey, speed up ♪Blizzard of cherry blossoms Hey! - You're famous? - Yes Yeah, yeah! Sort of I got it! You're Tetsuro Nambu's brat! Ah, what was your name? "Neat"...no... Elite Man, you're cool! Ah, can I get a picture? My kid's a fan Go ahead Ok...oops, it's on video Sorry, can you say something? Sure Good evening, this is Elite... Oh, it cut off... So, even celebrities party around here? A woman? You got a girl around here? I've got to get going It's alright, hold on I bet it's a model, huh? Right? Hey, hold on a sec! Excuse me... Huh? Getting pissed off? - Not at all - You going to hit me? You know what happens then? - Hit me - No Think you're cool cause of your parents No, excuse me Your dad isn't that great He was cool a long time ago Now he's just a baldy And your mom used to be pretty Fat and thin, back and forth Now she's doing infomercials Drinking prune juice, the old hag Even her husband got sick of her You can act cool now, but baldness is hereditary Hey Leave my parents out of this!

That guy He got mad when you called me baldy? That's not all Basically, I pushed him into it But none of this is reported in the news The price of fame... What I really want to say is... you've got a really great son Thank you He really is He was even nice as a small child I'm very sorry So are we Thank you For telling us this Thank you Me, too What? For calling you baldy so much...sorry We've got one more story of parent and child Case 4: Masaomi Minowa Passed the bar at 26 then studied law at Columbia University Japan's leading international lawyer who, starting with the US, has acquired credentials in 27 countries It's 120% certain we won't settle out of court So are you insisting that Mr. Numata leaves the company? Since we are preparing to battle, I'm not negotiating out-of-court See yourself out See yourself out Even this type of man has a weakness You want to apologize? To my daughter... Is apologizing okay? We don't live together I got divorced when she was only 6 That's why you want to apologize... - The divorce? - Yes No, that was a mutual decision that was amicable Then what for? First, can I ask you something? Go ahead Just once, I... raised my hand to her While I was studying at Columbia University, I had an apartment in Manhattan where the 3 of us lived Getting my credentials in the States was a lifelong goal of mine But that didn't matter to my 3-1/2 year old daughter Very hairy armpits Statue of Liberty! What is that? I have no idea Maybe something from a movie on TV a famous line Ah..."nectarine armpit hair 14 meters" No Very hairy armpits Statue of Liberty! What movie does that come from? I'm not sure... Very hairy armpits Statue of Liberty! Noni... Daddy's working Okay Very hairy armpits Statue of Liberty! Noni, what is daddy doing? Working! And when daddy's working? Don't bother him Yes, very good, now go find mommy Okay C'mon, Noni! Very hairy armpits Statue of Liberty! I don't think it's funny Very hairy armpits Statue of Liberty! Noni! She just wants your attention It's kinda cute It's cute but the exam... Enjoy it now Soon she'll be ignoring you Very hairy butt Washington Treaty! Noni! Who taught you that? Mommy Then, on the day of the exam, at last, I... crossed the line Eri! What? Why didn't you wake me?! I thought you had already left... I'm late, I'm late! My tie! Ahh! Man! Very hairy armpits Statue of... Your daughter probably doesn't remember That's what my wife said But I can't forgive myself, as a parent... and as someone engaged in law No matter what the reason, raising a hand to a 3-1/2 year old girl Curry, please 3-1/2... Can a 3-1/2 year old remember? Even if not, it's heartbreaking, cause I remember it vividly I believe it is still in her subconscious Since then, I haven't even been able to touch her Apologies are better when done sooner, so you might have missed your chance There is that, but In my line of work, one has to be very cautious about apologies and the "apologize first" way of thinking is dangerous in other countries Wait, wait...? The admission of guilt puts you at a disadvantage in court What? I've heard that somewhere before Where... Never mind...sorry I'm sorry, please continue After the divorce, we lived apart, but Unexpectedly, I met her again When I was a professor, she became a student in my department at the university Wait, wait...? It was payback... - Noriko... - Ah! Mr. Minowa... Huh? Noriko? I was horrified Visiting a father that can't apologize and presenting that sort of card I'm Noriko Kuramochi How cruel! That hairy armpit crap! Four years ago, I took one of your classes at West Tokyo University Greeting me like a stranger So patronizing... It proves she hasn't forgiven me Shall we make sure? What? She's on her way here What!? Why didn't you say something? Here is your curry, sir Sorry for the wait Calm down, Mr. Minowa - No - It's just an apology No, I can't possibly... - You want to apologize, right? - Impossible! Impossible! Ah! What's this? This...sorry...this Boss Boss! I got a call from Misaki Ube and she's dropping the case Really? Mr. Numata? You're here? This is great, isn't it? We're settling it But what about the lawyer...Mr. Minowa? Don't worry about that - Huh? - Nothing Can I eat this curry? Go ahead Huh? Case 5: Kosaku Wada Angry that I made you wait? Who is it? A movie producer? Seemed like it... A good-for-nothing, huh? Anyway, when he gets here, it's "Be Dogeza" That's been bothering me Instead of "Be" shouldn't it be "Do"? What? You really mean "Do", so it should be "Do Dogeza" Whichever you want You can't just say "whichever" Welcome... Sorry, really... Sure, sure, sure... I'd prefer not to stop the screening Yes, I'd prefer that We'll discuss it in person Yeah, yeah... But... I'll be there at 4 pm Yeah...what? Yeah, but...later, you say? Sure... Yeah, see you... Alright then... Sorry bout that Don't say sorry! Huh? I'm Mr. Kuroshima of the Tokyo Apology Center Bargain Sales Cinema's Wada... You seem very busy Yes, thanks In this age, that's no longer seen as a virtue Unfortunately, pretending to be busy doesn't work on us Lame! No, I wasn't pretending... You were 20 minutes late, but talked on the phone for 5 If you had talked outside, you would have been 25 minutes late Which do you think is ruder? Umm, sorry Your attempt to look busy actually has a negative effect on your apology So, how can we help you? This is a film I produced I know this! I read the book Who...who? Who is it in the movie? Huh? Odagiri? Well, it might work Since it sold 600,000 copies, we'd be foolish not to make a movie, even if it bombed, right? There's a complaint about the content Would you like to preview the film? I cried, I laughed... It moved me Boss, you slept through it, but I cried my eyes out Did you kick me? So what's the problem? You didn't notice? The scene where Akira rushes to Tsugumi Right, the love scene? Akira is a dog Dog? There's a person in the background of that scene Person? A criminal? That would've been better Actually... a king King? A future king, to be exact Have you heard of the kingdom of Mantan? We filmed their crown prince We received a complaint from the government of Mantan Akira? Akira! I found you, Akira Stop it there! Don't stop it... Hold it right there Back it up a little! Rewind it! Rewind... That's too much, go forward A little more Just a little more More, more, more... Okay, stop! Here This is the crown prince What? He doesn't look anything like one Just a normal guy That's why we didn't realize it Isn't Mantan... where all citizens "Embrace Happiness"? Yes Apparently he often comes into Japan incognito to go to places like Nakano or Akihabara to buy figurines or DVDs Basically, he's kind of a nerd It so happened that day he was at a meet-and-greet event nearby Cut! - Once more! - Once more... Thank you This is a set, please refrain from making purchases - Hey, you - Yes, sir? - Over there is too empty - You mean here? It'd look more natural with 2 or 3 more people Got it...hey... Excuse me? Do you have a few minutes? Could you stand right here? I'll hold that Sorry, we need two more here! Got it! Sorry for the delay Okay, test shot! Upon further research, we found it's a crime to capture images of the royal family...worth 20 years What? Even worse by hidden camera... in those case, they've actually killed the paparazzi That's risky Then the director got picky... Wrong! Can't you walk normal? See, like this Don't look at the camera! Face forward! Walk at a brisk pace! Are you royalty?! But he really was royalty You just don't have any grace Shall we give him a beer? Yes, sir No issues with the sponsor? None It's good, right? More like summer In Mantan, drinking is prohibited by law Moreover, forcing someone else is good for 30 years The sponsor noticed, huh? Now that's it! Okay, can you try walking like you're drunk? Yeah, that's good! Yeah, just like an old man Is this beef? Or is this? Ah, chicken! Oh, you can't eat beef? What? Is it against the law? It's against the law... 40 years... Or death by firing squad... Or? But isn't chicken okay? Right, chicken and beef aren't the problem Apparently eating skewered meat is a serious offense That's crazy! - Why's it illegal? - Then why change to chicken? It was just what he preferred What the heck!? Capturing images, 20 years, drinking, 30 years, meat, 40 years... altogether it's 90 years Or a firing squad It would suck to get a firing squad after living to 90 This isn't funny They are also having anti-Japanese demonstrations ==Anti-Japanese Sentiment Explodes== Today, I brought along the director and our company president You are all determined to see this movie open, correct? Of course, we've invested a lot of money in it And you are determined not to cut the scene, right? If you change it, it's no longer my film Therefore, an apology is the only solution - Apologize? - Yes Tonight, from Narita Airport's Terminal 2, you will be headed to Wan Bataar, capital of Mantan - Tonight? - Yes The Embassy has instructed me to not go empty handed and to pick up some gifts from the duty free shop Items that typify Japan are best, right? Incidentally, "sorry" in Mantanese is "wacha" Wacha Good... Furthermore, a more polite version is "wacha, wacha" - Wacha, wacha - Excuse me... Wacha Are we 3 the only ones going? I have another matter to attend to Waiter, ashtray please If you'll excuse me Our son, Elite, had an incident I know He has to give a public apology immediately - Yes, yes - What? Ah, sorry... I mean "wacha, wacha" Ah, it's you! He's a busy fellow, huh? Probably just pretending Ah, Director! How have you been? Welcome to Mantan! What is it?! No need to go down there What is it? You must be cold Are your heads cold? Did you bring hats? Me? Translator Name is Wakubaru It's hard to pronounce, so "Hiroshi" is fine Ah, I'm... I really don't care I basically know what you've done Basically, don't worry Basically, leave it to me It's chilly I don't trust him Let's all smile, really friendly Director... How have you been? Welcome, welcome These are filmmakers from Japan Welcome Our Minister of Defense Basically makes 2 million Yen Our Minister of Culture Basically makes 2.5 million Yen Our Deputy Prime Minister Welcome to Mantan! Basically, he makes... That's fine We brought gifts Yes, of course Paper lantern, basically 50,000 Yen Ah, tiger candy Basically, 14,000 Yen A traditional Japanese handicraft called a "kokeshi" The head squeaks Get them! - They are very happy - Liar! Get out! Get out! Get out! Don't come back! Tokyo sure is hot A t-shirt would be nice Who are you? Wakbal the translator But "Kiyoshi" is fine I'm sorry Up until the last minute, I was going to go with the Okinawan lions but I thought kokeshi would be cuter The shape did it The shape? Basically, the Mantan people hate it Basically? Ah, here it is The capital, Wan Bataar, was once the scene of heavy ethnic conflict caught up in heavy fighting, many indigenous people were taken prisoner their hands and feet were bound and their hair was shaved and ultimately, their heads were twisted off in public Such is the disgraceful history of Mantan... And then without knowing, you twisted the neck You smiled and went squeakity, squeakity And so the kokeshi's form is reminiscent of those prisoners Basically Basically? - Oh! - What? The king of Mantan is seeking an apology from the Japanese government They apparently issued a formal statement We demand an apology and we will accept nothing less Mantan forever! Ah...he's angry He's angry, isn't he? Is it going to be okay? Is what? Mantan is the third largest producer of raw cotton in the world 78% of Japan's cotton comes from Mantan Therefore, the prices of sanitary products are going through the roof He's famous for making a fool out of himself Americans eat a lot of meat, that's why their farts stink Japanese sports teams are too serious Send them some call girls Plus he was grilled about getting up in the middle of a Diet session I was a bit hungry... I was eating pancakes at a coffee shop After that, he was known as the Pancake Minister Don't worry, when I was younger, I knew the king during the 6 months I was the Japanese ambassador in Wan Bataar Kunimatsu! Kunimatsu! Welcome, Kunimatsu Kunimatsu! Welcome, Kunimatsu! Oh, Kunimatsu How have you been? I'm here, everyone! How have you been? Ah, did you get fat? Give me a break Ah, your son! - How have you been? - Man, you've gotten big! Oh, I've got gifts Gifts? Wow, anime stuff! Cool! Wow, Mamoru Oshii! God-level! Kunimatsu's the best! He's still an idiot How have you been? I'm here with our nation's film makers due to the violation of Mantan law in capturing the crown prince on film and the disgraceful actions against the Mantan people As Japan's representative, I would like to express my regrets I, Kazuyoshi Kunimatsu, think of Mantan as my second home Therefore, I can easily say that the king and I are like family I love Mantan! I love Japan Thank you! I love Mantan! And so everything came together ...or so it appeared Hey, hey, surrounding me... Didn't you hear? I didn't drink that much wine Male bonds overcome the cultural differences across borders - Mr. Kunimatsu - Huh? - And that's all - Don't you know? What? The Mantan king just made another announcement Really? All trade with Japan is suspended What? - What happened? - What does this mean? - Whaaat? - Minister? Don't you know anything? Just now, the king of Mantan decreed a stoppage to exports of raw cotton Sanitary products have disappeared from store shelves in Tokyo Sold out Furthermore... Women that can't purchase sanitary products from stores are headed to bedding stores Cotton is disappearing from bedding stores, too Across Japan, cotton is selling out! Think carefully, Mr. Kunimatsu After the press conference, where'd you go? Didn't I got back to the hotel? Basically, you went back to the hotel at 10:16 After the conference, you went to a party the king threw Yeah That's where you stroked the head of the Crown Prince's son Surume! Don't cry, don't cry... Oh, you're here! Surume! Surume! Wakbal! Is that a big deal? It is! In Mantan, stroking a child's head is an action reserved only for the king Cut it out! Not even my parents can do that! Got it? Not only that, but it was the king's grandson! A national disgrace! The party was relaxed and the wine was flowing Wait a minute, Isn't the penalty for drinking... Drinking's okay for foreigners Did you drink? Or you? Just me?! I apologized on behalf of the country, isn't that an achievement? They can overlook one drink One drink? The Minister's "achievements" were captured on film by Wakbal Enjoy the slideshow A drunken Minister Kunimatsu hugged the royal daughter-in-law, was denied a kiss with the king's wife, tried to hook up with the secretary, wrestled with the king, threw up in the bathroom, kept asking for the email of a maid you liked defaced royal artwork Impressive that you did all of this in just 9 hours Just getting started, the Minister headed for the red light district and proceeded to rant to the reporters that accompanied him I really love hugging Mantan women...really! Cause they really know how to treat men Compared to them, the men are real dimwits This problem was all because the Crown Prince is such a dimwit I even came here to apologize That kind of man should go back to Japan and work in adult movies Fill 'er up! Get me a call girl! I'm so very sorry! Of course you are apologizing now Ms. Edishita I'm Foreign Minister Edishita I've already set up a public apology Mr. Kunimatsu, as Minister of Culture, please create your final masterpiece Yes, ma'am! From now on, I will be in charge of negotiations with Mantan The people of Mantan... Does this seem like it's over now? I thought so and I'm a Dogeza pro Dogeza pro? And now there's a man getting out of another Jeep This person... - Mr. Nambu - It's Nambu We're not sure who this person is Suddenly, the people of Mantan What? He's really popular It's completely changing 22 years ago, Nambu first appeared in Mantan in a war movie He portrayed their national hero, General Bataar As for me, I played the role of a concubine Mishima! Let's return to Japan together! Mishima! Mishima! Return to Japan with me! Mishima! Mishima! Mishima... I will not return to Japan! I will stay in Mantan! Bataar... This... is my home! Here... I will fight for the people! As General Bataar! The movie itself is a knock-off of "The Burmese Harp" What a piece of crap! When it opened in Japan, why was the tagline: "Mantan bursts out in tears, Japan bursts out in laughter"? Bataar! Bataar! Bataar! Nambu won the Best Actor Award at the Mantan Film Festival Ever since then, he's been treated as a national hero in Mantan Bataar, Bataar Bataar...oh, Bataar Bataar, please touch my child's head Bataar the Divine ♪Our Hero Bataar ♪Bataar, Our Hero Nambu! I have come here after many serious insults to beg your forgiveness! A Double Dogeza by the Foreign Minister and a film star, the boss' waves of attacks shook the Mantan capital city of Wan Bataar to the core Get out, you bastards Get out of my sight! I'm fed up with you! Get out! Get out! Get out! Huh? Get out! Get out! What? Why? Get out! Get out! The people of Mantan became very angry at their beloved Mr. Nambu and the Foreign Minister Japan's classic style of apology... What is it this time? What?! That pose is not good... Dogeza? The gesture of rubbing one's head on the ground In Japan it may be the highest form of the traditional style of apology but in Mantan it is the highest form of insult It means that "You guys are not even as good as a lowly earthworm" Basically Hey! You hid that on purpose! I guess I did... hide it The leaders of America, China, France and Italy have issued statements in support of Mantan Boss, do we really have to? This is for Japan It went so far that the Prime Minister must apologize But Dogeza... There is an apology greater than Dogeza Why did the boss insist that much on apologizing... Case 6: Yuzuru Kuroshima Born in Gunma prefecture in November 1971 Grew up with two sisters and his parents who ran a small inn Yuzuru's first words were not "daddy" or "mommy" Sorry After that, he entered a local elementary school At the age of 8, without any instruction, he experienced his first Dogeza He and a friend accidentally killed 50 crabs when they tried to keep them in the inn's hot baths I'm very sorry! That's when Yuzuru's eyes were opened to a strange sensation The adults' eyes, his friends' eyes, were all focused directly on him And it gave rise to this saying: ==When you apologize, you are everyone's hero== There have been a lot of complaints of boys lifting skirts so from now on skirts are prohibited for girls Shut up, you hag! What are you hags thinking?! Shut up! Yamamoto, don't call hags "hag"! Sorry, Natsumi... Dogeza reminded Yuzuru of the charm and fascination of apologizing Vice President of the Student Council or Co-Captain of the volleyball team, he chose positions that made it easy to be blamed and then apologize Hey! What are you doing!? Sorry, sorry! Entering the workforce... What? If you turn on the A/C you catch a cold? Customer Service Thank you very much! Thank you very much! Assistant Manager of a restaurant Are you okay? Sorry Hotel cleaning crew We are very sorry for the sudden cancellation Security guard ...he rotated through jobs. Let me take care of it But the turning point for the boss occurred about 5 years ago That day, the boss was standing in line at a ramen shop He had been wanting to eat there ever since he discovered its existence in a magazine a couple of months before It was delicious! Thank you very much! Let me wipe that down first Okay, sorry about that, next customer, please! Coming through, please excuse me Okay, that's 800 Yen, thank you very much! Excuse me, the ramen special Wait just a second, we'll ask in order What would you like? Is it okay now? - Excuse me, but... - Order! Excuse me, the ramen special - Okay, one special! - Okay, one special! - Okay, here's your pork ramen - Excuse me for a second Okay, three pork Pork ramen, sorry for the wait! - It was delicious - See you later Thank you very much! - It was delicious - See you later Sorry This was a typical shop that provided smug service by yelling loudly at the customers Going unnoticed, this future head of the Tokyo Apology Center had already apologized 4 times Sorry Sorry Sorry Sorry Although there was nothing wrong At this point, the excitement he felt about the ramen was cut in half by his dissatisfaction with the service And then... Hot! Here's a cold towel Okay, the ramen special Delicious! He ate the ramen in silence and left the shop Sorry to keep you waiting He drank coffee and smoked and tried to calm down 30 minutes 40 minutes 1 hour 1 hour... 8 minutes No good! Ah, there's a line here Excuse me just a moment Wait just a second, we'll ask in order I'm here for an apology Look at me! Huh? I got hit here by some boiling water and it was hot I'm a little busy, can you talk to him? I'm talking to you, Mr. Funaki! Please apologize I'll wait in the coffee shop I came here to apologize for my employee's behavior Huh? I was on the late shift that day and was embarrassed when I heard the story from Akaishi I didn't realize it was such a bother It's not the manager's fault... I'm not the manager, my name is Misenaga Mr. Misenaga? Yes This has nothing to do with you I just want that guy Funaki to apologize to me He quit yesterday - Is that so? - Yes This isn't much, but please take it You have his contact info? No, that's private No, that's not it I'm just going to wait here for Mr. Funaki This is the president of the chain and this is the operations chief from our parent company And Mr. Funaki? Well... This... isn't much but... No, I'm not trying to get money out of you - Then this? - No, no, that's not it! You didn't do anything wrong! Right, chief, Shimabu...? Chief Shima? Mr. Kuroshima, we've been trying to figure out what we can do for you To keep hot water from splashing we developed a system to control it Even after that, the shop continued to try to apologize But it's not that... - And then... - What? For even more safety, we installed this clear divider between the customers and the staff But... Even then, if hot water somehow splashes you get a "splash card" and you get a free bowl of ramen with 5 cards This isn't it, Mr. Misenaga All I want is for the person that splashed me to apologize Why can't it be someone else? No Why does it have to be Funaki? What you've done here isn't a bad thing, Mr. Misenaga It's not something to cry over Eventually, the shop went under It made me think there were people like me all over the world that just wanted an apology Lawsuits or settlements... it's not a matter of winning or losing People that just want to hear a simple "I'm sorry" And those that are suffering not being able to say "I'm sorry" Those kinds of people if they apologize, it makes everyone happy And the world becomes a peaceful place I get it So you started the Apology Center I didn't expect it to get this big Apologizing for the country Carry on I'm Prime Minister Otoya Sorry to bother you, I... I know who you are We've already apologized many times for this I know that I'm the one that has to go I should have done something earlier By the way... Yes, sir I heard you know of an apology greater than the Dogeza Is there one? There is Nothing? Nothing There's nothing like that What country doesn't respond to Dogeza? Ma'am You're the lady that works with Mr. Kuroshima, right? I am I know it would've been better if I apologized earlier...on that day I was young... I was kinda... trying to be tough I'm sorry Hey... apologizing to her doesn't do anything I know We saw your webpage You know a method greater than Dogeza What? Could you teach it to my dad? Why Dogeza? That's not it It's their greatest insult That's right As General Bataar! This is bad In Japanese, this sounds really strange In Mantanese, it is an apology Really? This? It really is? For example, this one? What? This... is something I saw on a movie when I was little I will not return to Japan! But the pronunciation... I can't say this This is the scene where the General apologizes to the people from his heart All of Mantan will weep! But Japanese people will laugh They'll fall down laughing Why are you crying? Ready? I'm only doing this once So watch closely Okay, I'll say it But make sure it has subtitles when it opens in Japan Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Walking Bobo June eyeglasses No! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! "Bataar's Hill" Very hairy armpits What's with the arms? Are you mocking me? Because... Because I'm saying "hairy armpits" Very hairy armpits!

On behalf of my nation... I apologize from the bottom of my heart Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! Very hairy armpits! Statue of Liberty! This is the wonder of the Dogeza "The Apology King"
