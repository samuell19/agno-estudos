Doutzen is here. We're ready for you. We're good on models. We are standing by. I have been walking up and down fake runways my whole life, I think. The first time I was introduced to a fashion show, I was, like, four years old. My dream was to walk in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. Coming from a small town in Brazil, it's huge. I just wanted to be one of those girls, you know, and wanted to be part of this incredible family. When I turned 18, I had set a goal of being in the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and had no comprehension of what was ahead. I was young and insecure and very scared. The first thing I did with Victoria's Secret was the fashion show casting. Hi! A lot of people ask us, "What do you look for when you're casting?" For us, it's very, very important to have someone who's enthusiastic and always positive and always happy... this gorgeous, healthy woman. I had never been more nervous in my entire life. If you could mix Jell-O and a cement block together... that is how my legs felt. -Slow down, slow down. This is a real opportunity to become a big star. I was so young... it was just mind-blowing for me that I'd booked the show and that I was there. I saw Heidi, I saw Laetitia, I saw Stephanie. Tyra Banks, Gisele, Adriana... "Oh, my God, oh, my God!. I can't believe I'm here. They're so beautiful." I never imagined that I would be on that runway. ♪ And we're gonna let it burn, burn, burn ♪ ♪ Burn, we're gonna let it burn... ♪ My first time doing the VS Fashion Show, that changed my entire career. It definitely puts you in the next level. That's what really got me out into the whole entire world. Everybody knows who you are. It's such an incredible journey. The years went by so fast. I wish I could slow down. I still don't know how it happened, but here I am. I made it. I'm just one lucky girl.

I would love it. I would hate it. I love the beach. I love the ocean. It depends who I could bring. That-That'll do, right? I would bring... my phone. A surfboard. A barbecue. A knife. A really strong man. And obviously we need Wi-Fi. A satellite telephone. My kids and my family. A drink. Should we build a fire? I can make fire. I'm from Africa. All right, we got nothin'. We'll make it fun. Oh, get me off of this island! I don't think anybody's coming. It could be worse. At least we have each other. Taylor Swift into next outfit, please. Oh, my God! All right, prep next section! Prep next section! Cara, they're looking for downstairs... they're fixing her little outfit... and Jourdan... those are the only ones I haven't seen. After the break, spend a night with us in Paris Only CBS Oh, my God! The looks model is the model that we use to try on the fashion show outfits. Looks models become big Victoria's Secret stars. We've had Ale, Lindsay and Candice. I got to try every single outfit. Trying on jewelry and feathers... I was blown away by the ideas. I can't believe you guys still have ideas left. ♪ Baby, in our wildest moment... ♪ This feels good. I like it. ♪ We could be the greatest, baby, in our wildest moment ♪ Being a looks model is actually a very difficult job, because you're a human mannequin, and you're being picked and poked, and they're literally making the outfit on you. Hey, Barbara. Barbara Fialho, who's been the looks model for the past couple of years, she is so enthusiastic about everything. She inspires us, and she really gets the whole team in a great mood. It's so important for us to have someone like Barbara on the team. It's such an amazing job to have. That's me. Oh, yeah. The special last year was amazing. Since the last show, so much has changed. I did my first major cosmetic campaign. I've done a lot of work for Givenchy. Everything has come to a different level. We chose an outfit for you. You did? We think you're going to like it. Oh, my God! Oh, my God. This is my favorite one, from the beginning. You deserve it, you deserve it. Oh... The journey continues. Bye. Stand by, Adriana. Music, track five! Projections Y-55, lampposts in at two! Adriana's getting her wings on.

And action! It felt like a dream. It was awesome. We decided to shootat night. It feels a little naughty to shoot at midnight. It's such a different way to see the lingerie and see us. We slept all day, we'd go to hair and makeup at 8:00, and then shoot all through the night. Our sleeping patterns were very interesting. At 6:00 a.m., we're shooting right in front of the Champs-Elysees. I'm just walking around in my wings in my bra and underwear, no big deal. And action! ♪ I've been infected with restless ♪ ♪ Whispers and cheats... ♪ Paris is luminous. It's the City of Lights, and we lit it up, literally. Victoria's Secret paid to keep the Eiffel Tower lit all night. It was unbelievably beautiful and special and romantic. ♪ That manifested... ♪ It was freezing cold. It was practically snowing. Put me in a cold situation, and I'm not a happy girl. It's such a massive production. Beautiful, epic scenes. It's an opportunity to perform. To turn sexy, I usually will do one of these. This is goofy Behati, um, being her stupid self. This is sexy Candice. And this is sexy. What? There was, like, a thousand paparazzi trying to get pictures of us... But we got the shot. Nothing can stop a VS holiday commercial. Lais is simply amazing. She's the sweetest, most gentle, beautiful thing I've ever seen. I've never fallen on the runway. But it's, you know, it happens, and it's awful when it does. To be in this show is a dream for every girl. It's a big deal. Last year, I got there to do the rehearsal. Then, I don't know how it happened. I just fell down. I thought I broke my ankle. It's always in the back of your mind. It's a scary thing. At the rehearsal, hurt your foot, and you can't do the show? It was a very sad moment. Okay. Everybody was freaking out because they said it looked like her foot literally broke, snapped from underneath her. Of course, I was very upset. You know, I start to cry. It was pretty heavy. And the next day, I woke up, and then, I tried to put my feet on the ground. No. No way to walk. I had to go out there and walk the show in her look. It felt really horrible. I felt so bad putting that outfit on, 'cause it wasn't mine, I wasn't supposed to have it. This year, I'm more than prepared for this show. Okay, Lais, can we see your outfit? Wow! It is hot! In the fitting, I told them, if I fall again, of course I'm gonna use my wings to fly. Because of what happened to you last year, we wanted you to know that we're going to have you open the section of the show which is called "Birds of Paradise." Thank you. Thank you. Thank you... I'm sorry. Tonight, I'm more than excited, happy. Nervous. I want for Lais, this year, to have the most incredible show, to have the most incredible outfit, to have whatever she wants. We're all gonna be behind her this year, and be, like, "Yeah!" I will definitely find Lais backstage. I want her to just have the best time. Kill it!
