That's why I don't go to clubs with women no more. I'll go with my boys, posse down. 'Cause women get you killed. I don't know why y'all coupled up now, that's some (beep). And knowing I can't fight.

I was in court for tickets. For tickets. I knew I was going to jail. I was so nervous I called the judge Your Highness. He said, "You understand your allegations about these tickets Mr. Roberts?" I said, "Yes, Your Highness." He said, "What?" I said, "What?" I played stupid like somebody else said that. "What?" I was so scared. Little court appointed attorney gonna tell me, "It's Your Honor." I said, "I am honored to be here, Your Majesty." Just don't send me to jail, that's all I ask. I ain't gonna jail for nobody. Nobody. A friend of mine had a gun in the car. In the car. Didn't tell me though. We listening to tapes. I'm just chilling like, "That's the jam." He said, "Go and get another tape out of the glove compartment." I go in there and see the gun.

My mama said don't go to jail for nobody, nobody. All we're gonna get is a ticket. Now when I'm in that (beep). I'm scared, I'm thinking about myself. As soon as the officer came to the window I said, "Excuse me officer, the gun ain't mine." He said, "What gun?" I said, "The gun right here." "He brought the gun. I brought the tapes." Now we in jail and he mad at me. I said, "So what, punk. I panicked." Three years ain't (beep.) We ain't got nothing to do. Look, he got 10, he ain't crying. He ain't nuttin' but a hoe. Life is crazy, man. You'll be a bum in a minute. You better keep yourself together. If you got a good job, keep yourself a good job. Keep yourself a good relationship. It's hard to find a good woman. They talking about good man. See men lazy, we're lazy. We're lazy. I got a friend asking me, "Tony, where can I find a girl with a job?" I said, "At a job, God dammit."

The Devil Hotel. This is the Devil's Hotel. My name's Tony Roberts, peace and love. (audience applauding) - Tony Roberts. Tony Roberts. Tony Roberts. Thank you so very much, Tony, again for coming. - I don't want the rose, I want my check. - Tony Roberts. All right, you guys are enjoying yourself so far? Yeah. It's a wonderful evening already. Listen, I have two friends who visit here every Wednesday night and they're at the bar, right? And sometimes they get into this argument. Well, last Wednesday night they got into an argument and one says, "Listen, I have more courage than you do." The other guy says, 'Man, shut up." He says, "Listen, I have more courage than you do." The guy says, "Prove it." He says, "Okay, bartender." Bartend said, "Yeah?" "You see that hatchet on the wall back there?" He said, "Yeah." He said, "Bring it over here to the bar." Bartend takes the hatchet down. He brings it over to the bar. He puts his finger on the bar just like this. He says, "Bartender, chop my finger off." Bartender says, "What, you want me to take this hatchet and chop your finger off?" He says, "Yeah, chop it off." The bartender, womp, chops his finger off. He don't budge, he don't flinch, he don't move. He looks at the other guy saying, "Now that's courage." The other guy said, "Man, that ain't (beep)." He puts two fingers up on the bar. He said, "Bartender?" Bartender said, "Yeah?" He said, "Chop my fingers off." Bartender said, "You want me to chop both your fingers off?" He says, "Yeah, chop them off." The bartend, womp, chops both his fingers off. He don't budge, he don't flinch, he don't move. He looks at the other guy and says, "Now that's courage." Just at that time, another guy comes up. He pushes both of them out the way and puts his penis up on the bar. Bartend said, "You want me to chop your penis off?" He said, "No, I want you to kiss it." "It'll get off by itself." (audience applauding) - Oh, we going to have a good night tonight. Let's have a really nice round of applause for Maleta Apogo. (audience applauding) - Give it up again for Rerun. Hey now. Hello there. No, wait a minute Black people, I spoke to everyone in the house. You know you can get loud. Let's act like you hit the lottery. Hello there. (crowd cheering) Yes, indeed. Yes. Indeed. As Rerun said, my name is Maleta. So how's everyone feeling tonight? Looking good. Put on your best. Some of you want your Sunday best on a Tuesday, but it's all right. I'm originally from Philadelphia. City of brotherly love, broken bottles, and cheese steaks. How many of you know about Philly? All right now. How many of you had a cheese steak? How many of y'all brought one for me tonight? Put your hands down, you're liars. Every last one of you. No, but you know what, honestly, though, I tell you I moved from Philadelphia because it was just too much violence in my community. Now I'm in New York, a nice safe town. Hey, that's what Giuliani said. And I believe him. Believe all white people. Take it easy. No seriously though. Like I said, but the thing, it was wasn't the street violence that ran me away. It was the domestic violence. I have to share with you, we look like family. Every weekend in my home there was just too much violence. Violence, violence. You know, I was so sick of looking at my mother kick my father's every weekend. Stop it, Ma. Stop the violence. And men, you know, I gotta bond with men. I ain't into male bashing. You know, you hate to admit to your asses being whooped. Isn't it true? Especially by your woman, right? "No, man, I got this at a basketball game." "No woman going hit me, I'm a man." And it was so embarrassing because my mother would get him with that one two punch. You know the one two punch? The one when she hit him and he hit the floor? You know that punch. And we be out in the middle of our jacks game, getting it on and all of a sudden you hear your mom go, "Hey y'all, you better come get your daddy." "He bleeding all over my kitchen floor and I ain't having it." And we had to sit in the emergency room listening to my father babble all night with his eyes swollen like a grapefruit. Talking about, "See, your mama don't know me, see. What she did is she snuck around and hit me. She didn't come in the front. Cause if she done hit me, I'd have hit her like a man." And that eight years old I'm thinking, "Yeah, Mr. Punk (beep) jellyfish." Wish he'd take a karate class or something. You know what I'm talking about? Defend yourself. Work it out, Daddy, work it out. Issues. No, but I'm proud to say, talk to my mother the other day. She is now reformed. She's no longer into violence. Yay mom. (audience applauding) Yeah, mom. She's now into physical fitness. Like there's a difference. Have you ever taken aerobics class? Violent. She called me the other day, she's all excited. She lost two pounds talking about some, "Maleta, girl, you need to get into shape." And I said to her, "Mom, I thought round was a shape." Correct me if I'm wrong. Square, round. But you know, now Black folk, don't we love our mother? You love your mother. Yeah. So you gotta follow what she says. So I listened to mom, I joined Living Well Lady. You know the fitness center? The cheap (beep) fitness center. Don't try and act like you don't know what I'm talking about, I seen your faces. But see, one thing I wanna tell you about the Living Well Lady Center is that they have two versions. There's the uptown version and the downtown version. Let me tell you a little bit about the downtown version. The downtown version is where all the little thin white women go to have an aerobics class instead of a sandwich. Get the (beep) out of here. And you know they got the best of everything downtown. You know how they keep it downtown. And I stepped in there, you know they looked at me as if I had in interrupted a Ku Klux Klan rally. You know that look? I said, "Excuse me. Look here, look here." "Look at the body, y'all I belong here." Now as I said, you know they got the state of the art everything, and I love everything because of that. But I tell you just one little thing that kind of annoys me down there. I gotta share with you 'cause we're family. It's the skinny women. Skinny women. (Maleta growling) Walking around the gym in those French cut body suits. You know the ones? The ones that cut the cheek just so. Well those skinny girls weren't gonna outdo me. So I went out and I bought me one. Honey, I stepped up on the Stair Master. Woo, there it is. I had to have that thing surgically removed. Oh Lord, the French cuts you deep, baby. I'm working with that broad British cut. Forget that no pain, no gain concept. I'm not down with it. Now, I told you there's an uptown version of Living Well Lady. Let me just share that with you, 'cause you're gonna love this. All of the women uptown look like me. And we position our bikes right at the window so we can make that decision. Should we go to Kentucky Fried or should we go to Wendy's? Kentucky Fried or Wendy's? Kentucky Fried or Wendy's? Oh, what the hell is a hot day. Let's just do Baskin Robbins. And you know we don't go to exercise. We go to socialize. When you walk in that gym slap that bicycle seat and say, "Not today, girlfriend, how you been?" Sometime might go use the bathroom, you know how it works. That's what the lifetime membership is for. Always need a place to pee, don't you? No, but seriously though, when you're like me, and for those of you don't know who I am, I'm dietarily challenged. Can you go to Kentucky Fried or Wendy's? No, but seriously though, for some reason you always seem to meet the men with zero stamped on their forehead. Like the other day I'm walking down Broadway. Man comes up to me no teeth in the front of his mouth. Hair all over his head. One leg shorter than the other. Name was Buster. What a name, what a catch. He comes walking up to me talking about some, "Hey, big girl." He talking about, "Something with you, something wrong with me, huh?" He talking about some, "I know a lot of guys don't step to you like I do." "Get it? Step to you like I do." He said, "But I gotta look at you, big mamma and I tell you, you definitely are my kind of woman." And I looked at him with all 32 teeth showing and those bedroom eyes and I said, "How do you know I'm a woman?" He said, "Oh my God, this is New York City, Let me get my (beep) out of here." Woo, you better take the crotch baby, in New York. Drag queen city. No, but seriously. Now y'all know where voice that is, stop it now. That's that bill collector's voice, ain't it? "Can I speak to Maleta Apogo?" "She ain't here." Oh, pretend you don't know? Put the kids on the phone, I ain't stupid. "Daddy ain't here." "Your parents?" "Nadda dabba doo." Oh, I'm not the only one, thanks for connecting. "Daddy died." No he... "We're at the funeral now." "Ain't that right, Daddy, oh." All Black folk, work with me. (audience applauding) It ain't easy, it ain't easy. It ain't easy being cheesy, thank you for applauding. You know seriously though. I tell you, people pass judgment on you. They look at you when you're dietarily challenged. You know what I'm talking about, right? For those who are dietarily challenged. And they don't know anything about you. Right away they look at you say, "They eat too much." That's the first thing, right? I ain't (beep) all night. Did you see me eat anything? I'm hungry as (beep), don't nobody know it. I can't get food stamps. Anyway, no. And I thought you loved me. No, but seriously though, for those of you who don't know it, I went to the doctor. And I found out I had a medical condition. Found out I had an eating disorder. I just keep eating disorder, that order, that order. I saw a plate of food pass by. Did you see anything? I thought I saw something, just checking. ♪ The clean up woman ♪ Where's that plate? ♪ Is the woman who ♪ ♪ Take all the chicken wings you leave behind ♪ Anyway, that's my other career. No, but seriously though. People, like I said, pass judgment on you. And you know, women, won't we do some things for a man? If we love our man, we do sacrifice. Isn't that true? Two years ago, my husband told me, "Baby, you got to lose some weight. I can't take it." So two years ago for the love of the man, I lost 145 pounds. Thank you. (audience applauding) That's right. I kicked my husband's (beep) right out the house. 145 got to go. I'm looking good, feeling thin. You got a man? How much he weigh? Boom, out the door. Ain't got to deal with that. I pay the cost to be the boss. All right, I like the... You got that look I love. He's shaking his like a minister, like I'm in church. He go, "Mm Hmm" Thank you so much. (audience applauding) - Maleta Apogo. Maleta Apogo. Wow. Maleta Apogo. How nice. We're having such fun tonight. I don't know about you guys, but I am having a ball. I'm just sitting over here. I'm crying over here, they're making me laugh so much. But listen all of you have seen me, or most of you have seen me on the What's Happening TV series, am I correct? Am I correct? You've seen me in the What's Happening show. (audience applauding) But listen, I was not always in show business. I'm also an investment banker. And I remember one night I was invited, me and my wife, that's when I was married. Me and my wife were invited to my boss's house for a dinner party one Saturday night. So we go and we are having a good time and I start drinking and I get drunk. I curse my boss out. I knock over everything on the table and he fires me. Well, the next morning I wake up, I say, "Dear, did I do anything crazy at the party last night?" My wife said, "Did you do anything crazy?" "You ate everything, you got drunk, you cursed your boss out, and he fired you." I said, "What? He fired me?" She said, "Yeah, he fired you." I said, "Oh, screw him." She said, "I already did. You go back to work Monday." (audience applauding) Let's have a nice round of applause for Sara Contreras. (audience applauding) - I want more love than that, God dammit. Because I will bring my family in here and this (beep) place up. How you doing? Yes, I'm a Latina. Where are you, my people? Everybody in the kitchen is like, "Represent." And you know Puerto Ricans are cool 'cause we speak Spanish, we speak English, and we make up some (beep) along the way. Have you heard this? Anybody who's never heard Spanglish. Okay, I'm gonna tell you it usually kicks up when we find out that we have to work late on payday and we have plans to go dancing. We're like, "No, no, no. Let me tell you something" "Do I look like I'm a supervisor, that's a (beep) over time on payday." Now, I was raised in a really, really rough neighborhood in Brooklyn and it cracks me up because right now I'm raising two kids up in Jersey and their experience is real different from what I had. And I have this little eight year old Latina valley home girl. She's got this Def Jam 90210 thing going on. I take her onto the playground and she's like, "Dusty jungle gym? Yo, mother, I don't think so." I'm like, "Hold up. You're complaining because the equipment is dusty dirty? Let me tell you about the equipment in Brooklyn growing up, it was missing." That gym was vandalized all the time, okay. It got to the point where the housing authority had to put security on it. Now, you know, you live in a (beep) neighborhood when your swings have a Lo Jack. I mean my kids in the suburbs, at night they might hear crickets and owls. When I was a kid, I used to hear, "Protected by VIPA, step away from the sandbox." Thank you. Yeah, so anyway. I did, I grew up in a yeah, it was a rough neighborhood. But I tell you the one thing, my mother was tough. I gotta give it up to like Latin and African American moms. They tough as (beep). My mother was a great role model. She was the type of woman that was resourceful. One day we were walking home from the A and P, this is a true story. We're walking home from the A and P and this little punk thinks that he's gonna mug my mother. I watched her beat the (beep) outta this kid with a loaf of Wonder bread. That's resourceful, okay. Then she chases after the kid when he runs away and she's running after him, "Mira, I'm gonna tell your mother, (beep). Because I know her from bingo." So it was rough, I grew up. I got outta there okay. I decided I was gonna go to college and I was gonna get an education. My husband and I had this dream about establishing an all Latino law firm. That'd be cool, right? And we were gonna, in the spirit of affirmative action, hire one token white partner, right. And we were gonna hire my mom to work the office. This would've been my mother answering the phone. She would've been like, "Ah-lo?" "You have reached the law offices of Contreras, Contreras, Quintonita, Lopes, Rodriguez, and Jones. What happened to you? He hit you? Oh no, no, mamita. You don't need an attorney. You need to kick his (beep). "Good luck." That would've been her. But you know what, I didn't do that. I decided I was gonna go into speech therapy, okay. A little Puerto Rican teaching people how to talk. And I went to Brooklyn College. Which is kind of like a contradiction in terms. I went to Brooklyn College to learn voice and diction. You do know how they talk in Brooklyn, right? I remember the first day I showed up in class. I was like, "Is this voice and diction 101?" The teacher was like, "(beep) A." I like this class. I'm gonna get an A. And I went into speech therapy. And I remember that one of the things I used to find really tickling was every once in a while I would have a parent teacher conference and I would get this mother walking into me and she would be like, "Oh, excuse me." "I won't like you to tell me how I could help my son 'cause he talk so funny." I was like, "You wanna help him?" "Learn sign language, mama." "And don't talk to him anymore 'cause you are the problem." I'm saying, right? So I live up in Jersey and I told you about my kids. They're a trip. I moved up here with my husband, but we're getting a divorce. Like I said, I'm Puerto Rican and I married a Dominican. Now, if anybody knows anything about that, they're not supposed to mix. Look she's shaking her head. I don't know why it is, but we not supposed to. But you know what the thing was, back then I took a lot of flack for it. But see, we met each other's needs. I needed five grand, he needed a green card. Worked for me. Hey, I'll never forget. That (beep) was romantic too. The judge was like, oh he was there with us. He was like, "Repeat after me." "Do you Sara vow to live with this man for two years to establish residency?" "I do." He was like, "You may not kiss the bride." I'm like, "(beep) that. Pay the bride, Papa." I'm only kidding. Actually, I'm getting a divorce. It didn't work out. I am getting a divorce and we're having this big beef now, me and my husband, my ex. Because see, I wanna teach my son that sex is love, okay. And he's real macho. So we kind of disagree on how we're teaching our son. I will sit my boy down and I'm like, "Papa, good sex, it starts here." And he's like, "Yeah, that's what daddy said. Daddy said, I'm right handed go for her left titty first." Parenting in the 90s. And lately this (beep) with Clinton. Okay. He came home the other day, "Ma, according to the President." I was like, "According to the president, what?" He's like, "As long as she's going down on me, I'm not having sex." I was like Papa, in this house if your (beep) is out and you are not washing or peeing, you're having sex. Don't try that (beep) with me, uh-uh. So I started dating again, which is a total trip. I don't know ladies, has this ever happened to you? You meet a guy at the club first date out. You're sitting at the table and you're trying to make conversation. And you're like, "Oh my God, he's (beep) so ugly. Woo." "Damn, woo, what up with those teeth?" "Was I thinking, dammit what was I drinking?" I hate that (beep). They stand in the shadows at the club, don't let you see how damn ugly they are. I hate that. See, and I won't stay. You know I won't stay. And fellas, I'm gonna tell you something. You ugly ones know who you are. 'Cause you got away with this all the time. This how you know we don't like you. 'Cause when we're walking into the club and we like you, you'll see that (beep). Especially if she's Latina. She's gonna use that special word that lets you know she likes you. She walking into the restaurant. "Damn, I hope he's as fine as I remember him." "Hey, how you doing? Boo." "Hi Boo." Then we get real stupid, "Let's go, Boo." 'Cause we're happy he's cute. But if we don't like you, you ain't getting a Boo out of us. We're like, "Damn, I hope he's as fine as I remember him." "Damn. Woo." How you doing, you? Listen, I gotta go 'cause I left my mother watching the kids. Oh I didn't tell you I had kids? I got like five of them, okay. I got five of them (beep), okay. And three of them are in Special Ed. Why? 'Cause I did crack when I was pregnant. Oh, I didn't tell you I was a crack head? "Where you going, baby?" So pay attention. Thank you. (audience applauding) Thank you. I tell you one thing, something very interesting happened to me recently and I gotta share this 'cause I think we all want to be family here. I was walking with my boyfriend. I started dating someone recently and the sister, 'cause he's African American, I heard her and she was like, "I hate when white women take our men." And I said, "Oh, I'm sorry Ma, I'm with that. I'm definitely with that but I'm not white, see I'm Puerto Rican so I got some African in me. Three, four, five times a week now." Woo. Let's clear that (beep) up right now. My boo-boo is good to me too. He's trying to hook me up. He's good to me, let me tell you. I remember the first time we made love, woo. He just rocked my world. Next morning he's like with an attitude. I was like, "Baby, what's wrong?" He's like, "Yo, when you with me, you with me. I don't give a (beep) who this Papi Chulo cat is, You don't bring his name up in my bed." I'm like, "Yo Papa, that's you. You my Papi Chulo." Have anybody ever been with a Spanish woman? Aye, Papi. Aye, Papi Chulo. (speaking Spanish) He'd never heard that. And he was trying to hook me up. Trying to buy me some Victoria's Secret. See, the secret is, is that it's not made for little Puerto Rican women. He bought me a teddie, the crotch was down to here. He bought me some thongs, the waistband was up to here. I told him to get me a pair of them long hoochie boots. They came up to here. I looked like I was going bass fishing. Then I went out with this young cat recently. Let me see, there was a guy here. Right there in the red shirt. Look at him right there. Look at that face. I got set up on a blind date with a... I'm up there in the years, you know. And they set me up with a little... Look at you, don't turn away. You right there. Look at his face. My age and him. Does that face not scream, "Teach me." Can you picture me in bed with that boy right there. You I'm not cool with that, just like, 'cause you're young. I'm on all fours and he's like, "What's my name?" "What's my name, Mrs. Contreras?" "Junior, I will (beep) you up, you hit me again." I went out with this guy recently. I gotta tell you about this one last date before I go. I went out on a day recently with this cat. I'm not gonna tell you what he was 'cause I'm politically correct. I'm gonna let you figure it out. He's like, "You know, I really like you." "I would really love to meet your family." I was like, "That's cool, 'cause I got a brother out on the island." So I took him out to Rikers Island Correctional Facility. That's where my brother lives. You know, anybody ever drive out there? Oh my God, right? You take that bus ride out there with all them people that go... Don't they look like they just escaped and they're going back for their (beep)? I hate that. So see, I don't like going out there. And I got this idea. I got this plan for developing greeting cards just for the convicted. Yo, there's money to be made here, Papa. Okay, see I'd rather be on a blind date with big old daddy here. It's about 25 good years good loving, right? My idea is you walk into the stores and the sections will be clearly marked. It will be like birthday, anniversary, Passover, lockdown. And you know when you're looking for the right card, you get real sentimental. You'll be like, "Oh, look." Convicted but not forgotten. Aww. "That's so sweet." And you could have like a special invitation card made up. It would be like, "Mr. and Mrs. Santiago are pleased to announce the parole of their son Ray Ray. Reception to follow at the McDonald's on 179th and Grand Concourse. No hoodies, no knives, "we'd like Ray Ray to make parole this time." And this one would have to be the most popular card in the series, the most popular. And you know how sometimes when you pop open a card it has like a little tune? This one would have a voice. And this is how the car would sound. It would be like, "To my Boo in lockdown." From my pen to the state pen. I'm thinking of you, Boo. Your gangster style. Your go-to smile. I know you miss my fufu. But 12 years is a long time for me to remain true. So I'll be kicking it with your brother, Mike "but I'll be thinking of you." That's my time. Thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. (audience applauding) - Sara Contreras. Sara Contreras. Listen, I haven't had a chance to dance tonight. What's up with that? Y'all know everywhere I got to dance. Ain't that right? Ain't that right? Y'all don't wanna see me dance, do you? Y'all don't wanna see me dance, do you? Make some noise. Do we have any music or do we have to make our own music? We gotta make our own music? Give me the claps, y'all. Come on, get a beat, come on. (audience clapping) Yeah, come on now. - [Audience Members] Go ahead, go ahead. Thank you so very, very much. Hey did y'all notice that I've lost a few pounds? Yeah, I've lost 108 pounds and 18 inches on my waist. People look at me and they do a double take. They come to me and say, "Rerun, what happened, how'd you lose the weight? Was it Slim Fast?" Well, I tried slim fast. "Was it Opti Fast?" I tried Opti Fast. "Was it Oprah Winfrey?" I even tried Oprah Winfrey. I tried the grapefruit pill. Remember the grapefruit pill that's supposed to melt the fat in your stomach? I even tried Sleep-Away. Lose weight while you sleep for $19.95. Y'all know what I lost while I slept? $19.95. Okay, this is a young lady by the name of Janine Rose. She has performed in comedy clubs throughout New York and New Jersey. Including the New York Comedy Club, Boston Comedy Club, and recently seen at Newark's Comedy Relief all-women's show. Let's have a warm round of applause for none other than Janine Rose. (audience applauding) - Thank you, thank you, thank you. I hope you guys don't mind if I make myself comfortable. Do you mind if I make myself? Okay, hold on one second. Well, I kind of brought something from home, you know. It's kind of like a security blanket. Something to make me comfortable. Something that I feel that, excuse me, that I feel that every woman should have in her repertoire. Give me a moment, I will... A set of steel balls. Now I know generally, you know a man, you see a woman with some balls in her hand. You check in, initially. But I don't want you to feel uncomfortable because I have balls too, okay. Exactly don't feel bad because I have... Women, I've got the balls. So I went out with this short, fat, bald-headed garbage man. You know, everything was cool. We were go getting along very well. We went to the best restaurants you can imagine. I gained like 10 pounds with this guy. But that came to a screeching halt too. One night after making love he reached over into the little refrigerator he kept on the side of the bed, I had to made into a nice one, it was really nice, and he pulled out a Twinky. And when I saw the way he ate the cream filling outta that Twinky I knew it was over. There's no way you're gonna have mad skills like that and be holding out on me. He's outta here, he's out. So I went out with this weight lifter. Again, another tall man with a body like a God. And that was beautiful. But he was holding back on me emotionally. You know what I mean, women? Why did they hold back on us emotionally? And I'm surprised, you know, because when I met him he was in the gym and weight lifters can be very emotional people. I see him, he's working out. He's over here. I gotta show you what I'm talking about. You understand what I'm saying when I say weightlifters are very emotional? Here we go. (Janine screaming) Later on that night with his girlfriend. (soft squeaking noises) I don't get it. I don't get it. You ever talk to a Christian person and catch them in their un-Christian like mood? You call their house and their kid answers the phone and you hear them in the background cussing. "Now God dammit, you little (beep) getting on my damn nerves. Who the hell is that on the phone?" "It's sister Janine." (throat clearing) "Praise the Lord?" Thank you. (audience applauding) - All right, let's hear it for Janine Rose. Can we have all of the comedians that came up tonight come on up, please. All of the comedians. Let's hear it again for all of our Newark Comedy Jam comedians tonight. Tony Roberts, Janine Rose, Sara Contreras, and Maleta Apogo. (upbeat hip hop music)
