Got really scared of the One-Eyed Evil? Little hut, turn your back to the wood and your face to me. That's cool! Now turn left! Standing march! One, two! One, two! Who's playing tricks here? Who's doing mischief here? Just you wait, I'll jump out and thrash you with my besom! Excuse me, granny, aren't you Varvara Yegorovna? Yes, that's right, I'm Yegorovna. And who are you? I'm Mitya. - What Mitya? - Just Mitya. Mitya Sidorov. - And what do I do with you? - What d'you mean? If you were Tsarevich Ivan, I would have given you tea and put you to bed. If you were Ivashka the Fool, I would've cooked you in a cauldron. And what should I do with you, Mitya, and Sidorov to boot? You don't have to cook me. I've brought you presents from Glafira Andreyevna. Presents? And by what right do you bring me presents from Glafira? I'm her great-nephew. I'm visiting her for holidays. And she sent me to you with presents. And I wanted to thrash you with a besom! It turns out the presents are for me and you're my relation. My great nephew. Welcome to our sabbat! I mean, our hut! My tongue seems to be slipping all day! Take a seat. Can't get rid of that habit. What are those awful things in your wood? Oh, my goodness! Have you met the One-Eyed Evil? How did you manage to stay in one piece? There's no escaping it. It steps onto a bridge - the bridge falls down. It enters a house - there go only squabbles and fights in the house. And what's this? What a keen eye you've got! It's my neighbor. Where's your neighbor? On a bench over there. Here she is, fresh from the bogs. Stop fooling, show up. He's one of us. My great nephew. Last name is Boggy. Kikimora, daughter of Kikimora. - And I'm Mitya. I know about you. - How come? You and Wood Spirit scare people in the woods together. Together! I have to do everything myself. You can't get any help from him. The sun has already set, and we haven't eaten yet. And what is this? An apple over a saucer. A gift from my niece, Vasilissa the Wisest. She was visiting with me, and left it. It shows everything that's going on in our tsardom. Is yours a tsardom? Of course, a tsardom. And what a tsardom! A prohibited one, a thrice-twenty tsardom. Now move closer and watch. Who's this? This one? It's Gavrila, the tsar's servant. How do you polish? How do you polish? It's no way to polish! And who's that? Makar. Makar Ivanovich, our tsar. A worthy man. Give me the brush. I'll teach you in no time. No, you can't, Your Majesty. If they see it, there'll be no end of gossip. Then close the door, and no one will see it. Yes, sir. What kind of life am I living? I can't work with an axe - it's not decorous. I can't polish the floors - it's not proper. I can't ride in a cart - it's not prestigious. Tell me, Gavrila, you think it's a life for me in this house? No. You have no life in this house. Tell me, have I ever seen anything good in this life? No, you haven't, Your Majesty, nothing good. But if we think about it... If we think about it, there was something good! Well, if we think... Then there was something. Sure there was. Oh, you... There was, there wasn't. First one way, then another. It's not fitting for a tsar to polish the floors. I'm not polishing the floors. I'm just gliding. Can a tsarjust glide? No, no way. You've been set up as a tsar, so you stand. They set you up - stand. They sat you up - sit. They lay you down - you just lie. And I thought when I'm a tsar, I'd do as I wish. But they don't let me do anything. There's a lot to do. The entire Boyar Duma has gathered. They're waiting only for you. Gavrila, call them all here. You know, Chumichka, to be a tsar is as bad as not to be a tsar. Great thought! Let me write it down before I forgot it. It's not a thought, just a stupidity. Don't argue, I know better. It's my job to write down your thoughts for your grandchildren. I can see who's present. Who's absent? - Boyar Golilov. - His grandma's sick. This time it's his grandma, last time it was his grandpa. Once I put him in the dark room, all his grannies will get well. All right. What's the latest news? Everything is fine in our tsardom. But there's bad news, too. Two of them. Report them in order. First of all, Nightingale the Robber has showed up. He must have escaped from the hard labor, and has robbed two merchants. What do we do? Send the streltsy after the scoundrel! Right! Yes, that's right, but not correct. It'll be pretty costly, we'll have to tear horses away from work. What do we do then? What do we do? Think. Look, kid. Run to Vasilissa the Wisest, ask her what to do. Why is he sleeping on duty? Why does no one wake him up? He who wakes him up will be in big trouble. - It's Drowsy himself. - So what? He's mighty strong, because he sleeps all the time. No one can wake him up. If you want to, you can wake up anybody. Just try to. That'll be the end of you. No, don't even think of it. As he wakes up, he starts to fight. Only later he begins to think right. I see. Listen, Boyars, to the idea we've got. Let's draw pictures of our Nightingale, like this, and like that. And send them over villages: this is the escaped robber Nightingale, of such and such age, with both legs left. Half a bucket of silver as a reward. The peasants will catch him in no time. Great idea! We thought about that, too. The tsar's ideas must be carried out. It has already been carried out. Here. Way to go. All right, then. What's the second news? Vasilissa the Wisest has sent you a birthday present - a magic ball. Where's my present? You better ask your scribe that! Don't believe him, my tsar! He's lying! - So the boyar is lying, isn't he? - Yes, he is lying! And Vasilissa, who sent the present, is she lying, too? She is! They're all lying, my tsar! And you're not lying? No, I'm not lying! We'll see about it. Search him! Oh, my tsar... You don't trust your most loyal servant! Come on, search me! I've got nothing on me! Nothing! I told you so, didn't I? Well, kid, bring me his cap. The cap always fits. Well, scribe, what do you say now? Father-Tsar, my dear, have mercy! Flog the hell out of him! I promise I'll never do it again! Please, dear tsar, have mercy! I'll be a good boy, Father-Tsar! You think it's easy to be a tsar? Now you punish, then you pardon. Yes, he's a thief, but my own thief. I hate to punish one of my own. Hey, you! Enough stewing the scribe! Throw him out of our town! We don't want any thieves here! And one, and two! All right, Your Majesty! All right, dear tsar! You just watch out! To spite you, I will let out your most vicious enemy! Koschei! And why this? Serpent-Gorynych flew out hunting. May he burn in hell, our precious! Why precious? Because if you curse him, he'll eat you. Yes, there'll be no end of troubles now. We won't be able to see anything for two weeks. What shall we do? We have to watch Chumichka, or that villain may set Koschei free. In my bog all magpies began to crow. It's a sure sign of trouble. You have to fly, Yegorovna. I'm too old to fly. And it's too cold in my mortar. As for the besom, I won't be able to hold onto it. How long will it take to get there? You'll wear out five pairs of shoes to get there. I know how we'll go. Will you take me along? I'm not going to walk, no way. You don't have to. Doesn't your hut have legs? Yes, it has. So, let's ride in it. Let's put those legs to work. Good boy! Great idea! I've been living in this hut for 300 years, but it's never occurred to me. A very smart idea, indeed! Only my hut is quite decrepit, it won't stand the journey. It will fall apart at a second mile. Perhaps you have the magic carpet or some other magic stuff? Dear, where can we get carpets? Yegorovna, how about borrowing the self-propelled stove from Yemelya? It's summertime, he doesn't stoke it anyway. What a smart friend I've got! Run to Yemelya and take the stove. Tell him it's for me. In the meantime, you run and fetch some water. - It's too small, it won't be enough. - It's not a regular flask. It's larger inside than outside. It can hold three pails of water. Look after the kitchen garden. Water cabbages, weed carrots. Should any tsarevich shows up, tell him I'm out to the capital. I'm tired of them as it is. Some days as many as 3 of them come. And I have to wine and dine everyone. My hut is not an inn, is it? You're right, they give us no peace, those tsarevichs. Don't worry about your kitchen garden, I'll take care of it. - Have you brought water? - There you go. Why is it so blue? Where did you take it? - In the lake. - Sure. I hope not in the bog. - Were there any goats on the bank? - Yes, some little goats. Right, it's the blue-goatee water! He wanted to turn his grandma into a goat! It's bewitched water. Anyone who drinks it will at once turn into a goat. - Even a fly? - Why not? Even a fly. I wish Glafira Andreyevna had this water. She has no goat, but many flies. You'll take it to her as my present. Now it's time to go. Goodbye, my friend! Come on, stove, forward! Godspeed! From where does Chumichka want to let Koschei out? Where is he now? He's been chained in the tsar's dungeons for 200 years now. Only, hush... It's a secret. Does Chumichka know about it? Everyone here knows that secret. Good evening, Your Majesty. Hi. Well, I'm listening to you. I came to offer you the throne of our state. The throne? It's good. And where's your tsar? Makar, or whatever his name? He wants, you know, to go to the village. Right, with a name like this, he'd better go to the back of beyond. That's where his place is. What a brilliant thought! May I write it down before I forgot. I see you're a smart fellow. What's your rank? Just a scribe. Chumichka. From now on you're no longer a scribe. I appoint you my first friend and adviser! At your service! I have to drink 12 pails of water. That will bring my strength back. Ten. Eleven. Twelve! Tomorrow I'll give you this pail filled up with gold! At your service, Your Majesty! Now, forward! I can't wait to put on the tsar's crown. Yes! Yes! Yes! Waking me up?! What was it? Nothing. I ran into a post in the dark. A very interesting post, looking like a fist. Really? Yes. Don't lose heart, we'll do more serious things soon. Now go and bring me the crown. Stealing again? Oh, you villainous soul! Listen, my dear. Take a pen and paper and write that you're giving up the throne, the crown and the state to me! No way! Hey, guards! Come here! Get the one on the throne! Follow me! Forward! Before me. There you go. Listen, foreman, sound alarm. Foreman? Who said 'foreman'? Hundred-man! Come here! Why hundred-man? He can count only up to four. Up to ten, Your Majesty. Then he's no hundred-man. Such a brave guy, and so educated! A thousand-man - that's what he is from this minute! Come here! Thousand-man, come here! Millionsky, in my direction, forward march! Follow me! Gavrila, what about you? Are you for him or for me? I'm for you, Your Majesty. So you're against me? Why? I'm for him, of course, but I'm not against you, Your Majesty. What's the matter with you, Gavrila? Didn't I feed you? You did, Your Majesty. - Didn't I clothe you? - You did, Your Majesty. - Then come to me. - Yes, Your Majesty. Do you want... to be fed in the future? I do, Your Majesty! - And be clothed? - I want to, Your Majesty! Then come to me. Yes, Your Majesty. Excuse me. So, Gavrila, you're for him? It means you're against me. Why? I'm for him, of course, but I'm not against you. Your Majesty. Listen, grandson, wait quietly here until I return. - Where're you going? - To the palace. I'll take a look far and wide, for our cause not to backslide. You're going to scout? I'm going on a lookout. Stay put on the stove, or I'll cook you! What do we do with the tsar? We should execute him. That would make a lot of things easier. Don't you have any pity for him? I do. I pity him very much. I loved him like my own father while he was our tsar. But that would be better for our cause. What do you think? As you say, Your Majesty! - Good boy! - At your service! What do you think you're doing, old bones? Ruining people's lives again? You're being insulted, Your Majesty! Shut up, you office drudge! You let him out, and now you rejoice? Take her down to the dudgeon as she is, with her besom! Follow me! Forward! Before me! The tsar goes down, too! Now everyone goes to sleep. But your eyes open keep. Tomorrow in our tsardom a new life begins! I'm not afraid of dying. I'm worried about my grandson, he's waiting for me on the stove. I've strictly forbidden him to get off. - Is he obedient? - He is! That's the problem. A naughty boy is bad, but an obedient one is even worse. Why are kids like this nowadays? You'd better keep mum! You let your slip crown through your fingers. Oh, the devil take it all! I mean you let your crown slip through your fingers. I could eat you raw. Grandma! Varvara Yegorovna, are you here? - Naughty boy! - He takes after me! Grandma, how can I help you? We must warn Vasilissa the Wisest. But you don't know the way to her. He's not from our parts. Wait, Yegorovna. Listen, kid. Throw this ball on the ground. It will lead you to Vasilissa the Wisest. You tell her everything. All right. - Wait, kid. - Waiting. Run! Guards, get him! The enemies! - Who are you? - Grab the boy! About face! Follow me! Before me! Get down! Halt! Gotcha! Get him! Halt! Everybody after him! Catch the boy! Get him! It will lead you to Vasilissa the Wisest. Hey, dear, where do we deliver Nightingales the Robbers here? We'll find out. Leave me alone, you peasant! How dare you bring Koschei's best friend in bonds? Untie him now! Oh, my brothers, my dear robbers! Welcome, welcome! How embarrassing! Who could know that the bandit was his best friend? How could you let the peasants tie you up? Why didn't you whistle? Whenever you whistle, everybody falls dead. How the hell could I whistle if they had knocked my front, whistling, tooth out? Without it... there's no whistle. - Have a new one made. - I need gold for it. Have an iron one. We, bandits, are supposed to have only gold teeth. With iron ones, we'll be laughed at. You'll get your gold tooth. The first-rate tooth! Whom are they waiting for? Are they expecting someone? They say, the One-Eyed Evil is to arrive. It had been done with long ago. It is no more. Oh, One-Eyed Evil, may you be crushed down!.. Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty, Serpent-Gorynych is here. - There. - I see. Why are you trembling? Are you scared? Sure, I am. He would eat us, and won't choke on it, our fast-flying tyrant. Don't worry, he won't, he'll spare us. Of course, he will. Why should he eat me? He can find someone better. Then go and treat well our dear guest, and put him to bed. He must be tired from the road. And feed well each of his heads. It'll be only for your own good. You got me? Got you, Your Majesty. I sure got you. These are appetizers for our three-headed. The pigs are for the main dish. And this is for dessert - fresh milk along with cows. I'm going to show you! Shoo! There! Get it! Club, to your place! You've got it bad? What is it to you? Why are you being rude if you came to my house? I didn't come to you, I came to Vasilissa the Wisest. I am Vasilissa. You?! Vasilissa?! You thought I looked different? Yes. I thought you were... What? - All right. What do you want? - We have to save my grandmother. - What grandmother? - Varvara Yegorovna. She's locked in the dungeon. Who? My aunt? Has Makar gone absolutely crazy? - He's locked up together with her. - Who's on the throne, then? Koschei the Deathless. That's real trouble! How are you going to rescue them? How... I don't know how. You called me, dear? Make us some strong tea, uncle. We'll have to think hard. Well, bandit, have they made you a new tooth? They have, Your Majesty. It's time to demonstrate my Herculean strength. - Don't even think of it. - Why not? You'll deafen all my retinue. So what? Those simple folks got out of hand. You want to practice? Go to the grove. As you say, Your Majesty. Let the trees suffer. We've chased him for half a day, overriding the horses. But we couldn't find him. He's disappeared. You've let the boy slip, you bunglers! It was Vasilissa who made that magic ball. So, that ball will lead to Vasilissa. Go to her, take the streltsy with you, and get the boy. And tell Vasilissa... Again I'm monstrously full of beef, My mouth is chock-full of new teeth! I sing my song without fail: Grab, plunder, don't play goofy! It's an easy life for Nightingale, As long as Nightingale is toothy! Let's give it a try. Waking me up?! - Who are you? - Get it! It's just outrageous! They knocked my tooth out again! I'll be complaining. We'll see each other at the palace. I've just read about it, and I was suspecting it, that Koschei is not so deathless as people think. Yes. Only where is his death hiding? Where can we find it? My grandma told me that there's a big tree on your seashore, a huge chest hanging on it, in that chest there is a bear, in the bear, a hare, and in the hare is Koschei's death! Good for you, Mitya! And good for your grandma! She must be a learned woman. Well, uncle, you must go to the seashore, and quick. What are you saying, dear? If Koschei finds out that we were looking for his death, we'll have disasters with no end of consequences. Never mind, we're not afraid of consequences. And you, Mitya, will have to rescue Makar and Yegorovna, or they may be executed. You won't chicken out? How shall I rescue them? This is not a regular cap. Check it out. You can't see me anymore. It's cool! But don't be in a hurry, or you'll ruin yourself, and others, too. You understand? Yes, I understand! There go consequences along with disasters. Come on! I'm going to show them! Quiet, stop it! What a naughty boy! Hush! - Well, what do you want? - Yes, what do you want? What do you want? The boy! Give us the boy! What boy? We got no boy here. - No boy. - Just a house-spirit. Check it out. Please, dear guests, check it out. There's an order for you, Vasilissa Afanasyevna. Here, sign for it. With great pleasure. Please. That's right, an order. Find the boy. Find him? - Find him. - Search the chamber. I'm off. It's none of my business. My job was to deliver the order. And the invitation to a feast, a festive feast. We'll be having a feast tonight, with refreshments, music and songs. You're cordially invited. There's no one there! No boy! Club, to your place! Who's the strongest and the dearest? Who knows no fear? Who's the world-famous? Who's always victorious Over anyone that comes near? Our Koschei, Koschei the Deathless! Our father and benefactor! Our Koschei, Koschei the Deathless! Our tsar and our protector! The most profound! The best that can be found! He's the one! We all elect it! We'll give Koschei everything! We'll leave ourselves not a thing! We'll spare nothing for him! So high he's in our esteem! And so much loved! Our Koschei, Koschei the Deathless! Our father and benefactor! Our Koschei, Koschei the Deathless! Our tsar and our protector! The most profound! The best that can be found! He's the one! We all elect it! To the health of His Majesty, Koschei the Deathless! God protect! God protect! Are you playing jokes at the tsar's friend and adviser? Why playing jokes? I didn't even think of it... Watch out, then! How dare you do it to me, Millionsky? Water! Pour water on him! Part them, pour water on them! What's going on? Cu-ckoo. What d'you mean, cu-ckoo? - What is it? - Waking me up?! Who?! Ah, Millionsky. They've knocked my whistling tooth out again. Grandma! Thunder and lightning, it's my grandson! Run for your life, quick! I won't run for my life alone, it's not becoming to me. We all will be saved, I know how. Shoot it. You can't get out of the palace without the cap. But we have only one cap. That's the problem. Don't interfere, or I'll eat you up. Go on, Mitya. You get out first. Then you pass the cap over to us through the railing. Uncle Makar does the same, and I get out, too. What a smart boy! Good for you, kid. He takes after his grandma. But why do I go first, not you? You're the tsar, after all, though without a crown. Hurry up, Grandma. All right, let me rake up my old skills. I'll do it in a jiffy! One! Two! Mitya, there's a lock here, blast it! It was Chumichka who hung it! He tracked me down. Run, Grandma! Run, Yegorovna! You'll be of more use at large! That's the boy. A pretty boy. A redhead. Give him to Serpent-Gorynych to eat. Him alone? Both. Let me, Koschei, be first to take death. The last wish is the law. Humor the tsar. Try to. I'll humor him. I still got the flask with the blue-goatee water. - So what? - That's what. Good boy! You take after your grandma. Give it to me. What if we splash it into Serpent-Gorynych's mouth? - What will happen? - A goat will happen! Halt! Open the gate! We brought them to be eaten! You can't! They've eaten already. They've eaten three cows, they may burst. Look how gassed they are! Gassed or not gassed, eaten or not eaten - it's none of my business! I've got an order. They must eat, and that's it! If they must, then it's another matter. If you said they mustn't... And who are they to eat? They'll eat whom they must! Get out! It's our Father-Tsar! What's going on? Oh, my dear, are they really going to feed you to this scarecrow? To our precious beast? May he choke on you! Well, how are you doing? How's your health? Thank you, I have no complaints. Losing such people! Such people! - Where to now? - What do you mean, where? Where are you talking to your beast from? From the loft, there's a special window there. Take me up there. Keep your eyes on the boy! Grandma! I'm here, Mitya! This one is done with. You won't get away! Uncle Makar, watch out! Your Majesty! Your Majesty, they ran away. Who ran away? The boy and Makar. Send Serpent-Gorynych after them! Now! There's no more Gorynych. Are you crazy or what? I'd rather be crazy. Makar poured something into his mouth, and he turned into a goat. What goat? A three-headed goat, Your Majesty. What?! Are you kidding? No, Your Majesty! You're going to... answer for it! It's not my fault, Your Majesty! It's not my fault! It's not my fault, Your... Prepare for battle, scribe. Can we, sort of, rout them? Don't you worry. They'll gather their friends around them, and we'll knock them into a cocked hat. We'll knock them alright! I'm deathless! They will never find my death! Oh, uncle, I got tired of waiting for you. Have you found Koschei's death? What? There was a hitch. We blew it. A duck flew out of the hare. I turned into a falcon, caught up with it, hit it, and an egg fell out. I caught the egg and clobbered it with my beak... Who ever clobber eggs with beaks?! A needle with Koschei's death is hidden in the egg! That's the problem. The needle broke out and fell in a haystack. - I was searching for it, but... - We need a magnet. What magnet? We haven't invented such here yet. You got a tailor's scissors? Yes, we got scissors. What for? Scissors are like the magnet, they'll attract any needle. Give us the scissors, uncle. This is a futile idea, you'll just waste your time. It'll take you no less than 12 calendar hours to get to the seashore. - It'll be faster on a bike. - Well, if on a bike... The ball will show you a shortcut. But hurry up, Mitya. Soon the battle will begin! Well, Vasilissa Afanasyevna! Let's pray and begin. Why shed blood in vain? First we need to talk. What do you have to say? Vasilissa Afanasyevna the Wisest and Tsar Makar, to avoid bloodshed, propose that you confess and plead guilty. Then you'll be forgiven, punished and pardoned. Pardoned? No, let them plead guilty. And I'll pardon them then. Or maybe not. Shoot him in the back from your bow. - How? - Just like that! So that our troops had no way back. Waking me up?! Coming, Your Majesty. Well? Is there such a brave man among you who will come out one on one against me? Here I am, Nightingale! Meet me. What's the matter? Well, Nicingale, how are you seeling? Shame on you! He's teasing me! Serves you right, fat belly! You should have been smarter. Now is my turn. Wait, Makar, we can't win them by numbers. We need to use brains. Have you got everything ready, uncle? One more enchanting moment, one more explosive log. Run for your lives! No, Your Majesty, you sort it out between yourselves. And I... I... I'd better sit here and watch what will be the result. If Koschei gets away, that'll be a great disaster. Forward, boys! You've won. It seems our time has not come yet. And it will never come. Take him away. To the dungeon. For my deftness and smartness, I was given this magic wonder here. It makes tea, it boils milk. It's called samovar. Yes, a samovar! Mitya, how do you manage your two-wheel machine? - You don't know how to ride it? - No. Come on, I'll teach you. All right. A good boy. A redhead! Look what a needle my grandson got me. It will last for a hundred years. Sure, this is a cool needle. I've never seen such in my life. You'll know many a magic tale, About the turnip, the golden key, And Chernomor, who, of no avail, With his beard scared everybody. And in the end, for the whole world to wonder, After all the adventures and fights through which you pull, You'll get filled with real merry candor And become as clever as Ivan the Fool. - But why? - Because. I don't like when a fairy tale ends. Oh, how quiet and how pallid, Oh, how wondrous and how weird, Oh, how frightening and how droll, But the end will be happy for all! The End
