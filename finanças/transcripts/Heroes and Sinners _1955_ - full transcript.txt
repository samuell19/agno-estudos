When you came back to France you must have been happy. At first yes. There were reasons, right? Only then I had to look for work. My father was a shopkeeper. He could have helped him... ...the store but it was destroyed. ruined. I couldn't take it anymore, do you understand? The only thing he knew how to do was fly. But fighter pilots are not for big companies. It was good for those who made war but not for civilians. He could have returned to the army but he was fed up So Africa. the adventure I tried everything. Plantation watchman. Guide for current hunts. 200 thousand francs and I guarantee you a dead elephant. After 4 years I started to miss airplanes. I found a job in a company in Dakar. And why did you come here? Too long to explain. I think they're knocking on your door. - Excuse me, do you have a fire? - Yes. Have. In my room It is very difficult. I'm very sorry, rv ma'am, but it can't be.

No, but I always like to hear it Wait - And Sidney, do you love him? - Yes I want you. - And Severin? - Is this an interrogation? Since I'm interested in you, it's just to know. Why are you still with him? He pity me. And is it out of pity for Severin that you sleep with Sidney? - Michael. - Well, excuse me. What are you thinking? In you and me. I saw you took the revolver last night. It's strange. I do not know anything about you. There is not much to know. - Did you come to hide? - About. Did you kill someone? To a lot of people. Only he was in uniform so he was authorized. If Villeterre manages to sell your diamond, will you leave? - Of course - To France? Logically. It will be worth having come here And then, the lovers, Do you want to have a drink with me? I invite you. -Yes. And then in love, the tropics are beautiful, right? Don't they dance? - Women are no longer faithful. - I met one in Scotland, very beautiful. But no fidelity. I'm fed up! One, two, three... a right-handed young man. Without a doubt, my young Horace. He would give anything to feel cold for even five minutes. I'm fed up I want it to be cold, it's hot Then make a contest*!'Give a banana to the one who cries the most. i shouldn't have come easy to say You shut up! You were the one looking for it, not me. You have to have many desires to get here. Enough! Don't start recounting your life. An endless dance, lightning in Africa, a race in Strasbourg. It has cost us dearly, hasn't it left marks on you? To me, yes. A series. and enough nonsense! The war has been forgotten for a long time. I have good news for you. Yes? Yes. I found a client. She took a great interest in his stone. So they just have to come to an agreement. Well, I'll go get a scotch. I'm counting on it not being stolen. Of course. bye bye Are you happy ? You are kind. Thank you for worry. How strange The only thing I could do for you was to help you Yes, I was wrong. You realize? Everything has a meaning. Sometimes happiness falls from the sky. Did your diamond fall from the sky? Exactly. And me with him. I scratched all my skin. Looking for some medicine in the medicine cabinet was that I found the stone Two hundred million diamonds in the rough. Contraband of course. He made the traffic without knowing it. What would you have done in my place? You wouldn't have mentioned it to Lambert, would you? Lambert was the one who hired me. It's good crap, believe me. Still, I had doubts. Then I told myself that it was the opportunity of my life, ...so I kept them. Only Lambert wasn't happy, you know? His men have chased me everywhere. Some friends sent me here to see a certain... ...Bockin, to whom he could sell the stones. But they had deported him. He's done, now you know. Lord Riviere! Couldn't you knock? Excuse me, I'm in a hurry. Wolf Gerke. I have just arrived in Free City and just spoke with Mr. Villeterre. I am interested in your pied, I am a buyer. How much do you want? - Eight hundred thousand francs. - Quite a high value. A cigarette? With pleasure. I already saw that somewhere. - That air force was well known. - Fighter pilot? 47 victories, approved. Not bad, I left it at 35. In that case we are comrades. We can speak frankly. If I had more of those stones, I'd be much more interested. Infinitely more. I have. So, put the cards on the table. Come on, a former pilot does not hesitate. Two hundred million. Well, I'll offer you three million. Don't you think that's a good ticket to Paris? Come on, Mr. Riviere, don't make a face. The stones belong to us and I am in charge of recovering them. Three million, and not a penny more. It's my first and last offer. Say yes or no, nothing more. I'm taking the stones, and the two of us are in peace. Go away! Calm down, Riviere, calm down. They never took me prisoner. I always beat my opponents. Besides, you don't look like a killer. Three million Riviere, and not a penny more. For now, keep them. Very soon you yourself will be begging me to take them. I'm in room number eight. Excuse me, ma'am. What happens? Your Villeterre is a convict. why? He betrayed me. And what will you do? get lost from here I will help you. No, no. It's okay like that. Don't you trust me? Michelle! Where are you going? If I understand correctly, quadrille is Mr. Lambert's hobby. Anyone can't traffic weapons. Also don't worry, those diamonds are legal. Not for me. I know that song. Johannesburg, the four-way Dakar connection, then on the way to toast. No, dear friend, I have good connections that keep me in the loop. What amazes me, and saddens me, is that Mr. Lambert didn't count on me, ...I could have taken care of that matter myself. Mr. Lambert thinks highly of you. He greatly appreciated his help on the oil issue. However, he believed that this matter was not "worthy of you. A very attentive delicacy. So they don't need my services. On the contrary. I don't understand, this morning he requested. I ask only one thing. Find a legal way to stop Riviere from leaving the country. Legal. Like diamonds? I understand very well, sir. But who would buy a rough diamond? Nobody. Now if we were in Alexandria or Envers, ...or if he were just a well carved and polished lover, .but this, can not be sold. Or at least I can't. A tip. Don't teach too much, it's dangerous. Sleeve! It is necessary I wanted to sell As quickly as possible. You know everyone. Nina! Nina! I'm back now. It's burning me No, no. To look beautiful you have to suffer. what? It's a Parisian proverb. Paris, always Paris. I love Paris. - Me too. Here, give him a shampoo. - Okay, Nina. It's urgent, Nina. do you love him? Do you want to go with him? Confess it. You're crazy, I can't leave Severin. But you're dying to do it! In any case, I'll try. I know an American and you might be interested. Love is beautiful! We'll pack the bags and be right back. Okay. It's okay. Did you understand? Come back in an hour. - Okay. - Agree? Riviera! What are you doing here? They've been looking for you everywhere in Dakar for ten days. What's wrong with you? I thought you had died. I'll explain. Is it something serious? yes Tell me, are you leaving today? at 5 for Abidjan. can you take me I will try. I warn you that I do not have a visa. Listen: At 5 in the ground below, behind the hangar. We will pick you up at the end of the track. very good Luckily the tip is included. We will meet again, dear friend; Nina will help us. No need, I'm leaving. It's not true Michel, you can't. Why not? Tonight Nina will have a client, I swear. I appreciate your kindness but... I don't want to be nice! Is that all I am to you? You won't say you love me, will you? And if so? You'll be sorry because I'm leaving. No! Come on, let go of me! No! and Michel! And then, the little bird goes. I'm sorry too. I liked it. It's a pity you didn't wait for Christmas. Oh yes...! If I could too. This road and the road that never ends. Another two posts and we will have arrived. - Mr. Riviere? - Yes Get down. get down! Give me your passport. - What for? - Give me your passport You don't have a visa, follow me. Come on, get on! It's okay! A dark-haired man in his life. Outward journey, return. cards are never wrong Don't be sad. You will see Mr. Riviere again. I appreciate him much more than you. It won't last long, fear not. As soon as you give me the stones, it's yours. And forever. He has a very nice profession. We are not as lucky as others. Lambert, his boss is a bandit. you know it. I know. And sometimes he disgusts me. But I'm not the only one in Africa, am I? So can it be that he is a little pious? Sometimes So where is Michael? Don't be in such a hurry. There he is. Wait here. I will receive it. and my passport We'll stay with him for now. See you later, sr. Nice walk, Riviera. Was it you who offered it to me? Yes, and now I offer you a drink. Michelle. scotch Why not? Did you have a good walk? I'm glad to see you. A long day-right Riviere? escape attempt, arrest, .you're trying hard, man. And in this country that is bad. Don't worry about my health. I am very interested. Were the police friendly? Like cops. So did you understand this time? Understand what? That you lost. A battle is not a war. Nice phrase. It is not mine. I know, but this has no allies. What will you do without a passport? Listen to me Any attempt is useless. You played and lost. Give me the merchandise, if not... but? Otherwise you will never leave this country. believe me. Are you trying to scare me? You're smart enough to know I'm not lying. listen to me well Item 1: You will never have the diamonds. Article 2: go to hell. Did you understand? Article 3: the return of the merchandise will be made by Mr. Riviere. .within 24 hours from now. Last term. Did you understand? Won't you advise him? He must need it. A beer To the health of a compatriot. But you are German, right? At least there is someone who understands me. - Where are you from? - From Berlin, and you? - I'm also from Berlin. - Really? - From East Berlin. - Are you also wanted? Very hot, huh? I worked there for the government. yes? There are many paths that lead to that. How did it end up here? It's a long story. In order to have some clothes and food you have to work. To be able to buy a little of everything, cigarettes. - You have to live, right? - Well yes. Besides being able to have a good girl. You have to be someone. Yes I thought that too once. And I watched it all fall apart one fine day. The captain for the army. That was what they wrote to me. Do you know what my answer was? To then be tortured? In a German Army fighter plane? In the blink of an eye to see myself in pieces, accepted! And they dared to tell me not to be so pessimistic. I was eager for a change of my luck. And in the meantime it was time to say: "The foreigner." And one day it came. Just what they were looking for Young souls with much honor to the government of Africa. And there I was. A young soul as always. But, I tell you my life. - No, I like that. Tell me, is your name really Gerke? It is a strange question that arises. Aren't you really embarrassed? It is not easy being German. Yes, there are many people who don't even know what it really means. Germany! Health! You try too hard. It's worth nothing. I'm screwed. The big cake was not for me. There is the small aviation company with some friends... .of the squad, but it has to be tomorrow. - But since I'm... - No, I don't want to owe you anything. Or me? Don't get ahead of me Manuella. - Can I come in? - Yes. But, you don't see anything here - And then? - No, there is nothing to do. My friend sent me to tell you. I knew that. It doesn't matter, Nina, thank you very much anyway. And for the next one, let us know before you arrive. Listen Michel. - I mean, may I call you Michel? - Of course. Well, he is already there. If you want to leave, there is only one way. which one? Olsen He needs $1,600 to fix his boat. - But I don't have a dime. - I'll lend it to you. As if I have to sell everything I have to give it to him. you That's very nice, Nina, and when can we leave? Within one or two days. That would be fine. But I have to find a way to hide the stones. I can keep them at home. I have a safe. - They won't be in danger there. - Good deal. You see, you can make your honeymoon trip. - Shut up Nina! - This is not a honeymoon. Not at all! Ah, now I understand. It is something out of use. You're definitely fed up. I am more or less well and I have the diamonds. Good game, huh? But if you are a whore! Betrayed twice is too many. I thought you were less evil than the others. But you surpass them. Your diamonds rotted your head. Keep them well. Arrange them so that no one catches them, no one. - Now listen behind the doors - Me? Only pass. Hello? Severin here. Manuella is very ill. I don't know, she has a high fever. She asked for you several times. Very good. I'll be waiting for you. Amadou, come here. Come. Let's toast.
