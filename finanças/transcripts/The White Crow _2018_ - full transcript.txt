You knew No You knew what he was planning to do No You're saying he never spoke of defection? The subject never came up He never spoke of it? Never This is an attack upon the Soviet Union No It's about dance Dance? He knows nothing about politics He's gone to the West because there he can dance He could dance here Yes, but... I think it's likely he had an explosion of character That's who he is Mother will recover After immigration return your passport Thank you - Thank you - Nice to meet you We are delighted to be here Where are you off to?

I'm ready to work But not with Shelkov, is that what you mean? Ballet is about rules It's about discipline. It has to be That means it's about obedience Only through discipline can you find freedom I'd rather die than live under the rules One day you might be good enough to say that You're not good enough yet Far from it I believe I would progress faster with another teacher Which teacher do you have in mind? - Hello - Hello - You're Rudolf Nureyev? - Yes I'm Alexander Ivanovich Pushkin You'll find some space over there Take a bow - Is everybody warmed up? - Yes Boys, as usual, two demi pliés and one grand plié in each position Get ready Please Bend back, further back Hold your back straight Fifth position Assemblé, Assemblé Assemblé sauté, Assemblé sauté Brisé forwards, Brisé backwards Two brisé.

Listen, you're an intelligent man Work it out for yourself When you please me, you'll know Steps have a logic You need to find that logic not to force it One step follows another, with no impression of haste Or effort Steps follow. And belong They... are interconnected Thank you Sir This is impossible Why aren't we talking to each other? This is ridiculous Cheers Cheers Ladies, fouettés please How was your class? We have various outings planned All the main sights The Louvre, The Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Organised trips That's nice You haven't forgotten the company meeting before we left Leningrad? I never miss a meeting We agreed we go together on the bus Shall I put you down? Yes of course My husband said you've not been looking after yourself I brought you some soup It's not bad He said you don't eat with the others A dancer needs to look after his body He says you react like an animal who's been brought into the house I didn't know he'd noticed me Oh yes, he's noticed you This is French onion soup Not quite how they make it in Paris Not the right cheese You've been to Paris? No Have you been to London? I've only read about them Which city is better? Paris or London? Better for what? Better for life? Better for ballet? Everything They say Paris is more beautiful but London is special too People know more about ballet? Maybe Your husband is a good man I think so His class is two holy hours Eat the soup Don't worry, you will see Paris one day Sleep I'll come back soon Thank you Thank you You were spectacular! This is my friend, Clara Saint It was wonderful! Rudi, are you coming with us? Not now That's a pity Alright, what did you see? You came Liuba... Hello. Cakes Thank you. Come in Don't be shy Everyone, attention This is Rudolf Nureyev We met at the Leningrad Choreographic School's graduation evening He's a dancer Hello everybody Hello And also he says he's been going to the Hermitage every day - He goes to the Hermitage every day? - Yes And I told him a lot of us spend time in the Hermitage And that we all like to meet every Sunday afternoon a whole lot of us to talk, to talk about all sorts of things life, art, science and that he would be very welcome to join us I won't stay long Stay as long as you like. Everyone else does I don't want to be a trouble You're no trouble This is my brother Leonid, we are twins Hello Your sister started telling me about Rembrandt I want to find out as much as I can Rembrandt? Leonid's a student at the Polytechnic, like me I will have a drink and then go No. Have a drink and stay - C'mon sit with us - C'mon, c'mon It's a good time. There's never been a better time What, just because we're going to send a man into space? If you think about it the Soviet Union's not even fifty years old and yet we've caught up Ahead of the Americans! Yes, ahead of the Americans, yes! We went through terrible times But they're over The bad times are behind us now Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn, born in Leiden 1606 One of nine children Father a miller, mother a baker's daughter Introduces a new style of portraiture Sir, our shop... Look Are you all right? Yes of course, why? Rudik, your Father has returned Come and greet him I was wondering if perhaps you'd care to eat with us Eat at your home? I've spoken to Alexander Ivanovich about it I'm afraid our quarters are very modest He wants me to come? We're here Come in Ah Rudolf, yes, good Please, there's no need for you to get up I want to get up. And anyway you're here to eat Over here Sit? Xenia tells me she's been looking after you I hope you don't mind Why would I mind? I am of course interested... Thank you do you ever think about the purpose of dance? - The purpose? - Yes Nobody thinks about this It's true Why dance? To take the audience somewhere else Somewhere new Yes of course But why? Escape Just that? Is life that awful then? And escape to what? You see, all the time I'm teaching technique That's all I do However it is good to remember technique is only a means not an end "Oh he leapt perfectly" So what? "Oh she raised an arm it was perfect" So? We spend so much time on technique It's all we think about What should we think about? Story What story do we wish to tell? Why do so few people ask themselves: "What do I wish to say?" You need to let your feelings pour out Let's stop here Be more expressive with your body Sit down I received this letter Yes I am being sent to the Ministry of Culture of the Bashkirian Soviet Socialist Republic to apply there for future work Yes. So? This will kill me I don't want to go It doesn't matter what you want Do you know that I've been offered three different places? I didn't know that With three different companies The Bolshoi wants me One day you can go to the Bolshoi in Moscow Why not? But first you have to go and dance in Ufa If I go to Ufa, I'll never go to the Bolshoi I'll be too old Who do you think paid for your education? Your parents? No The State paid for you Soviet people Isn't it time you did them the favour of saying thank you? Artists have responsibilities just like everyone else What, you think you're above society? Go on, tell me For three years you've only taken Now you have to give something back I give back on the stage Yes, in Moscow, in Leningrad, you're happy to go there But what's wrong with Ufa? Do you look down on the people? No Your little home town I give something no one else can give Well? Who made you? Where do you come from? Who raised you? How can you be like that? Why are you looking so miserable? You know very well Everyone knows I want you to dance with me, Rudi What? Where? At the Kirov, where else? Did no one tell you? I've been ordered back home To Ufa Forget about that What are you saying? I went to Moscow to plead I'm asking if you want to join the Kirov Not in the corps de ballet Partnering me Partnering? A younger man... ... and older woman. Always a good combination I'll make you look talented, you'll make me look young Shall we try? Wait. Explain. What happened? Somebody spoke on your behalf - Who? - It's not important Just be grateful How? How did they do it? Not by spitting in anyone's face Artistic strategy, Rudi Thank you Hold my wrist, and then my hip Like that Little closer. Play please One, tow, thee, four, and turn Look, look in my eyes Carry on, soft elbows, carry on one, two, thee, four What happened? Are you here to ask stupid questions? - No. - Everyone knows what happened I fell I fell! I'm going to get you out of here You're going to leave hospital You need personal care They say I won't dance for two years They're wrong And don't look at me like that Hello It's impossible No. We'll do it We'll live together until you're well I'll look after you Good night Good night Give me a hand Wait for me here Dad Dad! It was bound to happen Sooner or later Inevitable It's not right You need to do it Good evening Join me You've got to be fair to me, Rudi I want to get to bed earlier And, what? You think I bear down on you? Doesn't it occur to you? I have someone bearing down on me They're all over me And they are much less pleasant than I am Look at it through my eyes I'm trying They want to know why I'm putting up with it You don't just damage yourself with your behaviour You endanger me Is that it? No It's not You go out every evening with this... Chilean girl She's a friend You go and watch naked girls? It's fun, Vitaly Dimitrivich Fun? And wealth is fun, is it? No She's going to inherit a fortune, is that right? You like that, do you? You like it You like the capitalist life? You stay out all night walking with her We've a lot to talk about Not just her Specifically: Western dancers... Western intellectuals Rudi, it's bedtime Well? They're just as late as I am Why aren't you talking to them? Because I'm speaking to you. You have a record I'm not interested in politics How long will you dance? How long? How many years? How long do you see yourself dancing? Twenty Thirty Thirty And you want to travel abroad in the future, you want to show the world what you can do? This could be your last trip If we decided to bring a charge against you What charge can you bring?

You've never danced better Did you feel the injury? No You see I said I would cure you Yes We can walk home together Do you think we can do that? You're only guilty if you choose to be I don't choose to be See you at home Why are you still there? It's his wife? Pushkin puts up with it because he's too weak to say no You like it, don't you?
