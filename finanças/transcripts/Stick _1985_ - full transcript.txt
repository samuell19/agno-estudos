THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING. I'M NOT DONE WITH YOU. WELL, I'M DONE WITH YOU. YOU CAN BELIEVE HIM. I'M NOT PAYING HIM. THEN DON'T PAY HIM. NESTOR. WHAT WOULD YOU DO? YOU KNOW SOMETHING, CHUCKY? YOU'RE JUST A PAIN IN THE ASS TO ME. I THINK I'LL CUT YOU OFF. NESTOR. SHIT. ESPERATE AQUI. VOY A PREGUNTAR SI PUEDE VERTE. ¿COMPRENDE? COMPRENDE. ARE YOU A FOOLISH MAN, STICK? I USED TO BE. YOU DON'T THINK IT FOOLISH TO COME HERE? I HAVE NO QUARREL WITH YOU. CHUCKY, HUH? AND $5,000 YOU SAY HE OWES YOU. HE DOES OWE ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT? PERMISSION. TO WHAT? TO GO AFTER CHUCKY. HOW DO YOU KNOW TO ASK PERMISSION? I DID TIME IN THE JOINT. I DID IT WELL. I LEARNED YOU ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION. EVERYTHING'S THE SAME INSIDE OR OUT. WE ARE GOING TO PRACTICE. COME WITH ME. I HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THIS INTERESTING. HE OWNS A BODEGA. A SMALL DISTRIBUTOR FOR OUR PRODUCTS, BUT HIS SALES HAVE BEEN DECLINING. YOU HAVING A LITTLE MOTIVATIONAL SEMINAR? PRECISELY. NOTICE HOW THERE ARE NO CHAINS OR ROPES. HIS BOND IS MUCH STRONGER. HMM? OUR BELIEF. THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. DO YOU BELIEVE? IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BUT WHETHER HE THINKS I DO. SO, WILL YOU KILL CHUCKY? I JUST WANT WHAT HE OWES ME. IF I WERE TO GIVE YOU THIS MONEY, WOULD YOU THEN JUST WALK AWAY? I THINK NOT. THE POINT IS, CHUCKY OWES ME THE MONEY, NOT YOU. YOU'RE A FOOL, STICK. IT'S NOT ABOUT $5,000, IT'S ABOUT RAINY. AND HE'S JUST NOT WORTH IT. DO I HAVE YOUR PERMISSION? WHY NOT? IF YOU CAN DO IT, BUT NO POLICE. THEY'D LOCK CHUCKY UP. HE'LL WALK THE CEILING FOR HIS MEDICINE. HE WOULD TELL THEM EVERYTHING. AND THAT WOULDN'T BE GOOD FOR ME OR YOU. I UNDERSTAND. I WONDER. HASTA SIEMPRE. HASTA SIEMPRE. YOU'RE KIND OF LATE, AREN'T YOU, STICKLEY? I'M GLAD YOU'RE STILL AWAKE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO ME DOWN HERE? OH. OK. WHAT DID YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT? I FORGOT. GOOD MORNING. WHAT? OH... YOU KNOW, I THINK I WAS RIGHT. I'M NOT READY FOR YOU. OH, YOU GIVE ME MUCH TOO MUCH CREDIT. REMEMBER, I WAS IN PRISON FOR SEVEN YEARS. GOT TO RUN. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I WORK HERE. WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME LAST NIGHT? THAT YOU WERE RIGHT. IT'S NOT CHUCKY, OR THE MONEY, OR THE REST OF THE STUFF. IT'S ME... AND THE WAY I FEEL ABOUT RAINY. GO ON. YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN PRISON. YOU LEARN THAT YOU GOT TO STOP CERTAIN THINGS. FEELINGS... ABOUT... YOUR FAMILY... YOUR FRIENDS. YOUR DAUGHTER. OTHERWISE, IT MAKES YOU WEAK. YOU GOT TO BE STRONG OR YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT OF THERE. I'VE BEEN BUMPING AGAINST THIS LIKE I WAS STILL IN THE JOINT. BUT YOU'RE NOT. YEAH. THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY KEEPS TELLING ME. OLD HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK. YEAH. REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU IF I HAD A CHOICE, I'D MAKE THE WRONG TURN? WELL, NOT ANYMORE. I GOT TOO MUCH TO LOSE. STICKLEY. DON'T MAKE PROMISES YOU CAN'T KEEP. NESTOR HAS A JOB FOR YOU. HAVEN'T YOU FORGOTTEN SOMETHING? CHUCKY HAS BECOME AN EMBARRASSMENT TO US. STICK KNOWS TOO MUCH. DO YOU UNDERSTAND, MOKE? YES. BLOW THEM AWAY. HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS PLACE? SWELL. THANK YOU. DAD. HMM?

THIS IS RED MEAT, FULL OF FAT. EVER HEARD OF CHOLESTEROL? THAT'S WHAT THEY PUT IN MEAT TO MAKE IT TASTE GOOD. HOW'S YOUR JOB? OK. IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY. I MET THIS VERY INTERESTING GIRL. IS SHE CUTE? OH, SHE LEFT CUTE AT THE STARTING BLOCKS. IS SHE PRETTIER THAN ME? NO. SHE'S MAYBE... THAT CLOSE. NOBODY'S PRETTIER THAN YOU. BUT SHE'S CLOSE. SHE'S SMART, TOO. SMART? WHAT'S SHE DOING WITH YOU? I THINK YOU'LL LIKE HER. IF YOU LIKE HER, I'LL LIKE HER, TOO. YOU KNOW, KATIE, I'VE BEEN GONE ALMOST HALF YOUR LIFE. BEING AWAY FROM YOU WAS THE WORST PART OF DOING TIME.
