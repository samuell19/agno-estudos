Please Busu, bring me the receipts tomorrow, I need them. Take these receipts to the house for me? Keep the change. Know what happened the other day? They found a man, 90 years old, stiff as a board in the old district, in Via Dalia, on the ground, with a hole in his neck. And after all the investigations, special teams, cops, people who wouldn't talk, know what happened? It was a bolt of lightning. My God! What the hell happened? He's dead. What can I do? How can I tell my father? A kid had an accident and doesn't know how to tell his father. Give me some water for him. He's owing and saying: "How can I tell my father?" His father will kill him if he finds out. I knew a guy who, for a scratch on a car, killed his father. Two shots. Ciraulo was his name. Take this, my boy. How come? What kind of car was it? It sure was important to him! That car was everything to his father. He'd earned it. The father, Nicola, worked at the boatyard. NO ENTRY Now you can come in. This time we get to go up first. Pa! Hey, Pa! Damn, he's deaf! Tancredi, let's go up. Fast, fish don't wait for nets! Get moving! You tell him, Masino. More this way! Move! They got here first. Come on, let's go inside. Come on, Masino. Take that. That too. And that other one! Take it, take it! Tancredi! See, Masino? They take the copper and leave us the iron pieces. Goddammit! We got it! I did it. Tancredi, look what a beauty Grampa brought you. You could get to the North Pole with this. Grampa, I'd leave this minute, even for the North Pole, just to get away. Want to be like Colapesce? Who's Colapesce? Who's Colapesce? Colapesce was a boy who thought he could talk to fish. Every morning he'd go to the sea he'd get closer and closer, he'd call the fishes and say: "Fishes, fishes... carry me far, far away - And then? - And then... One morning the fishes took him and carried him far, far away. What kind of stow is that, Grampa? It's nonsense. Are we at the theater? Tancredi, go see all the things your cousin Masino got, go help him out. Pa, you too! The sun's leavin' here... The sun's leavin' here... The sun's leavin' here, it'll be back tomorrow. If I leave here... If I leave here... If I leave here, I'll never be back. If I leave here... If I leave here... If I leave here, I'll never be back. Masino! Trying to compete with Uncle Nicola? What's this? What can I do with two cents? Go on, maybe next time. Drive the truck with the iron pieces. Next time? I know a place I'm gain' to. I'll make a thousand in a week, you don't get that in a month. Be thankful we're relatives, or else... Or else what? I'm related to Aunt Loredana, you're no part of me. Masino, a little respect for your uncle! See this load? It's my last one. Leave him alone, see how he is? Right, but Masino supports a family, what can that guy do? Tancredi's just a kid, wait till he grows and you'll see. Sure, he's great! What are you saying? He's weird, you can't tell what the fuck he wants. I can't support him all his life. Nicola didn't consider his son, he thought he should be like his sister... Serenella. That kid always looks at you with cow eyes. What is it, want to play? Get lost! Loredana! Rosa! What is it? Fill the buckets, they're shuttin' off the water. Loredana, get the buckets. There's no water, what's going on? They say the pressure's too low. It's the engineers' fault, they didn't think of it. It's the other administrators' fault. Masino! - What, Auntie? - The water's going off. Don't worry, I'll handle it Ma, just a minute! See if they shut off the water in downtown Palermo! They're hoodlums, it's just us they shutoff. I'm washin' this underwear in City Hall. Take ours too. Guys, let's go, we'll take care of it. Masino, be careful! Masino resolved problems, he acted like the head of the family. He wasn't a nephew to Loredana, he was a father. Grampa! Grampa, help me out. Stop! The mountain's this way. The mountain's this way. This way. That way. This doll's hands are like gold! I won't let you get married, I'll be too jealous. Stop. You have sleep in your eyes and your mouth's all dirty! This little girl stinks. - But there's no water. - I know. No water? We'll go to the beach, there's lots of water there. - What did you fix to eat? - Lasagna. Loredana, the kids can come with us, you'll have more room. Want to go? Okay Thanks, Antonietta. I freed you, right? You were dying in there. Breathe, it's good for the heart. Honey, you're a gem. Nicola, the kids have so much fun here. Giovanni! Seen the belly on you? What, my husband's got a belly? Holy Virgin, Loredana! Holy Maw! Nicola, the umbrella took off. Your son put it up, he can't even do that. Tancredi, come here. Don't worry you know, there was someone worse than you. - Who? - Giufa. One time his mother said: "Giufa, go buy some bread, and pull the door on your way out". - And then? - And then... He went out the door and pulled it with him. - Where to? - To buy the bread. Grampa, who the fuck can laugh at that? Remember, no swimming, you've just eaten. So when can we swim? In two hours. - Two hours? It'll be dark. - No, it won't be dark. Phooey, we gotta wait all that time? If you swim after eating, your digestion stops and you'll die. I knew a guy who went swimming after eating and he died. - Who was he? - My cousin's school friend. - School or class? - Class. It's so hot! Good thing we're in the shade. There's a little breeze here. Let go! Let go, Serenella! Serenella, what's the matter? It was her, she slapped me. You were playing so nice, make up. - Make up! - She almost pulled her hair. Come on, nothing happened, Antonietta. Well... Nothing happened. Ma, can we go swimming now? - Yes. - Put these on me? Don't play with her any more. Federica! She's as deaf as Grampa. - Serenella, it's late, let's go. - Let's go, we'll beat the traffic. I don't want to go. Let's stay a little longer. We can't spend the whole day here! - Get dressed and let's go. - I don't want to. Let's go! Loredana, you tell her or I'll kill her. - Obey your father, let's go. - I don't want to go. Forget her! Loredana, are you leaving the girl here? Nicola! - I don't want to go. - I'll leave you here. Leave! Nicola, go get the girl. Tancredi, go get your sister. Serenella, come here! - Can I go? - Okay, go. Come here, we're exploding spray cans. Serenella, can I play with you? How did it end up? Poor little girl. Nicola, you can't carry on like this Serenella... was my whole life. You know there's a law for Mafia victims? What? What Mafia? Sure! Compensation for relatives. You submit a petition, there's a lot of money in it. You think I'd take a few bills for my doll? What are you saying? Not a few bills, millions! We're talking millions. Giovanni, another load's here. Coming. Tancredi, let's go! And so it began with a series of lawyers and a never-ending stream of tax stamps and documents. But no sign of any money. The counselor said there was a problem, Serenella's mother's last name was Virzi, like Masino, a family with Mafia connections, for sure! So, in protest, Nicola decided to switch and be tough. You have to eat something, Nicola. I don't want anything. - You can't go on like this. - Go home! Just this, Nicola. Go away, I don't want any! It's all dropping on the ground, eat it. I said no, go home, I'm staying here. Until at last, one day... Just this morning, the news we've all been waiting for was put on my desk. The undersecretary personally and in writing has assured me the deadlock has been broken. It was an unpleasant waste of time, but now, I can say, it's done. Counselor, if I may, what's the amount and when? Considering the victim's young age and the inauspicious circumstances of death, et cetera, et cetera... the amount granted is 220 million lire. Serenella... my poor little angel went to Heaven. Counselor, it's a sure thing? No hidden tricks? It's a sure thing, it's even got the State seal. Are you kidding? Counselor, will we get the money right away? Not right away, it may take some time due to bureaucratic procedure, but you can consider it money in your pockets. Thank you. Thank you, Counselor. The neighborhood let the newly rich run up bills. Can you put it on my bill? For a lady like you... Don't worry about it, ma'am. Don't worry about it, ma'am. Time passed but there was still no sign of the money. Yes, but when's the money coming? How? By check or directly in cash? Will they bring it here or do we go to Rome to pick it up? Yes, I understand that... Fuck! I understand that. Maybe we have to sign something again, bring documents. The lawyer replied the first time, but as time passed he couldn't be found. - Hello. - Is the lawyer in? No, he's not. Isn't the fucking lawyer ever here? The bastard's never in? All the fucker's interested in is the money! The lawyer abandoned the Ciraulos' defense, but not before presenting them with a very steep bill. And the debts kept growing. It was difficult to even buy bread. You must realize, even a woman like you... I'd like to, but... I'm sorry... They say someone around here lends money, you know him? Sure, Pino, everybody knows him. - Would you introduce me? - Sure. - What the fuck is he? - Pino, a guy who lends money. A neighborhood retiree who knew how to put to good use an ex-taxi driver's severance pay. Instead of putting money in the bank, he turned himself into a bank. Great lover of music. Do you know where he is or not? They just built it. Tancredi, you have to be quiet and let me and Giovanni talk. Careful, let's not make ourselves look like shit, he's an important person. Pa, is this the banker's house? You gotta keep quiet, hear me? No, it's this way. Giovanni, where is he? - May we? - Here I am. Hello, Mr. Pino, may we come in? Please, have a seat. Sit down, Nicola. - How are you, Mr. Pino? - Fine. Mr. Pino, I brought my friend Nicola here to talk to you. Here I am. That's a lot of money, I don't keep sums like that in the house. You'll have to come back tomorrow. About what time? Do you know the conditions? No, actually... Giovanni, tell him the conditions. Do you understand everything? - Everything - Perfect. Giovanni told him how he was going to repay the money. The deadlines, the payments, the interest, everything. Loredana, here's the money. Here's the money. 1000... 7, 8... Loredana paid the debts, but Serenella's money still didn't come. As fast as it came, Mr. Pine's money was spent. I need money for groceries. Think I'm a bank? Do I print it at night? I paid the debts with what you gave me the other day. Make do, there's no more money. You're spending like crazy! You'd think it was just me eating. Know what? No money, no food. I'm going crazy in this house. Want to kill me? Did you bring the money? Giovanni, this isn't... Quiet, he's Mr. Pino, the exact same person. Actually, I need more. Do you know the conditions? What did he sign? Guarantees, installments. The only thing Nicola knew was he needed to bring home Serenella's money, soon as possible. Make it last until the real stuff comes. - What is it, Pa? - Sit down. We have to talk. We can't go on like this, I'm an old man now. - What? - I'm an old man. And this money business, Serenella's thing has worn me out. - It's just a phase, it'll pass. - It won't. You're my son. Too many things right now, too many problems. I feel a weight here. - But you're young! - If I die, what will you do? Whatsit your mother and grandma do? Who'll support them? You have no right to my pension when I die. - I don't? - No, no one does. Listen when I talk to you. Who are you looking at? - You have to be ready. - To do what? To take over. To take over in this place. What do you want to do when you grow up? Dunno. We can't go on like this, you're almost 21. At 21 I already had you and was supporting a family. Tancredi, you gotta get a move on. Your Pa's not eternal, he can't support you forever. Look at your cousin Masino. He doesn't depend on his father, he pays his own way, he's a year younger than you, he found a job and if he wants, he can get married. What the heck are you looking at? Do you understand me? I ran into Mr. Pino and he told me the payment is due now. He'd like to let things go for the moment, but he has taxes to pay and all the rest. And so? How much is it? How much is it? We don't have it. You have to find it. - Right away? - Immediately. Can't we ask him to postpone? You talk to him, you know him best. What are you saying, Nicola? You know, I'm your friend, but I'm Mr. Pine's friend too. And I want this stow to end well for everyone with no one losing out. Can't we do anything? We'll give him a down payment, maybe. Can't we come up with a plan? Unless you go talk to him yourself, it couldn't be worse than this. Giovanni, is Antonietta well? Taxes can't wait and so neither can I. Unless... I pay it for you. Maybe I understand. Mr. Pino says you have to give him the money today. But to do that you have to have money. And who can give it to you? Who can give it to me? Who's given it to you so far? Mr. Pino. And Mr. Pino, it seems, as an exception, is willing to lend it to you again, as long as it's clear this money's different from what he lent you before. You could do it this way: he lends you the money to pay the loan and the interest, you give it to him and you're even. Everything clear? Everything's clear Giovanni, explain the conditions. Nicola thought he knew the conditions, but he was wrong. They were worse than the first and the second time. Are you serious? Think I'm a fool? Do you realize what you're saying? What conditions? You can go fuck off! That's the thanks. Can we turn off that TV? Nicola, what's the matter? Why are you so nervous? I'm fed up being the only one working. If I don't think about you, who the fuck will? My son's 20 and lazes around from day to night. I should be happy? Why? What are you saying? I break my back from morning to night. Let's go to bed, it's late. Hello? Who? What? Police Headquarters? Serenella Ciraulo. Daughter of Nicola Ciraulo. What? My bank identification code? Can't I just come and get the cash? No, of course I have a bank account. Tomorrow morning at the latest, right away. Thank you. They want my bank identification code. Code? What is this code anyway? I mean, do we get the money or not? - And now what? - How the fuck do I know! We have to open a bank account. Think they'll let us open one? With Serenella's money, they'll open two. Who can we ask for advice? Only Giovanni. Nicola, if not Giovanni, then who? Giovanni? Loredana, I told him to fuck off. Still thinking about that? It's old news. Why should we have bad blood? Want a coffee? You know, the money's here. At last. Tell me something, do you know anyone at the bank? Sure do. But remember, keep the money in the bank as little as possible. Well, what do we want to do with this money? What I'd like is a little spot where, tomorrow, your father and I could rest, by the sea. Why get a house by the sea, if we don't have one in the city? Now that we're rich, we'll vacation in Cefalu! What are you talking about? I meant in the cemetery A nice patch by the sea. Ma! The coffee shop in Via Torremuzza is for sale. We could buy it like it is and fix it up little by little. - How much is it? - Not much, about 300 million. And where do we get 300 million? We don't have it? Fonzio, be quiet. We have too many memories here, too many. I want to leave. You know where? To Viale Strasburgo. So, instead of these old blinds, we'll put in new window frames, they're easier. What's wrong with this house? We rent, so what? So what? It's money going out every month Besides, you'll be leaving something to your son. If I gotta die, I'll decide what I leave my son. - What do we do with this money? - Don't worry. Anyway, we could never afford a house, know what they cost? A kitchen then, I'd like a kitchen with an oven, and everything. - The oven you've got isn't enough? - It's gas, now they're electric. Tancredi, what would you like? Pa, either a scooter or a TV since it never works. Giovanni's right, money shouldn't stay in the bank long, because they're the only ones who earn from it. We don't understand anything about bonds and interest, we should buy something useful for everyone. What's that? A car. - A car? - It was just an idea... You want to buy just a car with all this money? Yes, for the car I want. - Want a car that costs that much? - Not a lot, but not a little either. What car is it? - A Mercedes. - A Mercedes? Why would we get a Mercedes, with all the things we need? - We need an oven? - No, we need a Mercedes! We need a tomb? We need a car! So they'll all see we're rich. Nicola, let's be reasonable. You want to throw away money on a wretched coffee shop? Who'll go to work there? Me, of course. His lordship wants this, her ladyship that... we're losing our heads. It has a radio, air conditioning, electric windows, it has a turbo. A turbo... What's this turbo? It's a system that lets more gas into the cylinders. So the engine's more powerful. Imagine it black, it's beautiful. Blue's nice too. If you like, we can buy a blue one. Presidential! In less than 30 minutes, the idea of owning a Mercedes, was on top of everyone's list And Nicola, suddenly, felt like... the God of Palermo. Come on, get in, let's take a little drive. Madam, the bouquet must be left for the Madonnina. Father! Father Paletta! Hello, father. - Would you bless my new car? - It's late, my son. But my whole family's here. Just a moment. Cosimo, get... I have to make a blessing. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. God Almighty, creator of Heaven and Earth, in Your infinite wisdom, you gave man the brains and imagination to build these vehicles of transportation. Et cetera, et cetera... May the drivers of this vehicle... Me! ...Whether they're going to work or out for pleasure, drive with skill and care, et cetera, et cetera... and may they remember that God is always with them, forever. Amen. That's it. Here you are, if I may... Let's go, Cosimo. You could have given him more, it's bad luck. - Pa! - A black cat. I knew it, you should have given the priest more money! Knock it off, it wasn't a black cat, it was a field animal. What's that noise? With what little well-being had come, Nicola had become lazy. All he thought of was the new car, which he took care of like it was a person. He still went to the docks, but his desire to go was diminishing. It was a real bargain! Nice, isn't it? So you can look at yourselves every day and see how beautiful you are! I'm an old woman, it's pointless for me to look in it. Actually, it makes me jump, when I go by, it feels like someone's following me. Who'd ever follow you? Loredana, come here, scratch my back. Loredana, tell your son the light bill needs to be paid. Tell your son the bill is overdue and they'll cut off the lights, so he's gotta go pay right now, not tomorrow. Tancredi, go. Loredana, are you sure he's my son? He's nothing like me. What are you saying? This way. - Cousin! - Hi, Masino. Come here. I'm in line- They sent you to pay a bill? - Is that your motorbike? - Like it? It's not your speed. Oh, cousin, since you're here, pay this for me too? I'm busy. Don't think you can... Actually, keep the change, maybe you'll find a job here. Thanks. Cousin, what are you doing this evening? Why not come to the movies with me? There's a great film playing. It's far away and besides I have no money. Don't worry about the money, just take your father's car, the Mercedes, so we can drive out to Mondello. Pa would kill me if I touch it, besides I have no license. You're just a kid! Doesn't that car belong to everyone? See you this evening. Don't keep me waiting. You really don't know how to drive. Cousin, how's your mother? I haven't seen her in a long time. She's just a pain in the ass morning to night. Come here, Tancredi. - Hi, Stella. - Hi. Two. Two. Fix the focus, it's blurry Masino, she winked at me. So? I'll introduce her. - Her name's Stella? - Yes. - Hi, Masino. - Hi. Good evening, could you tell me the time? I don't have a watch. What's the matter, didn't you have fun? - It's so beautiful! - Careful. It's nothing, don't worry a little polish will take it all off. Your number's up. - What are you paying? - What? What are you paying? Thank you. Busu, you're here again? Come and get the receipts tomorrow, you can go. Know the one about the dog who recognizes his master... Busu, how can you not get bored all day? Wake up, Busu, you good for nothin'! What did you do to my car last night? What did you do? What did you do? Answer me, say one of your idiotic expressions: "I didn't do it on purpose, I'm sorry"... I didn't do it on purpose. You ruin an 80 million lire car and say: "I didn't do it on purpose"? Think that makes it okay? You're wrong! It's a scratch, Masino said it comes off. What does Masino understand about my car? - Nicola, what are you doing? - Get out! You know what Masino's gotta do when he talks about my car? He's gotta rinse his mouth with bleach. Get out! Look what you did. - It's a scratch. - A scratch? Loredana! What's going on? That's enough, stop it! - What happened, Auntie? - They're fighting. - Who? - Nicola is killing Tancredi, run! Just a minute, Auntie. Look, you ruined my car. Look at that, you scoundrel! Uncle, that's enough! Cut it out! What is this, a joke? That'll teach you, that'll teach you! No! You slapped me, that'll teach you! Never slap me, ever! What did you do, you wretch? Ask him! What? Shut up! Don't you see what you did? - We're ruined. - He asked for it. Nicola's dead! They're gonna throw you in jail. Jail? No way I'm gettin' arrested! What will I do without Nicola? It's his fault, he slapped me, he was disrespectful. Shut up, stop talking, okay? My son was disrespectful... You idiot, you scoundrel! What do you all want? You called me here. By now he's dead, that's it, now if I don't run, they'll arrest me. They arrest you if we decide they do. It's not enough to kill my son? You killed my son, the joy of my life. Want to put the family on the street? If another person had died, from another family, or if someone from another family had killed him, I'd say: "Arrest him". Look at me. But since it happened between us, we'll fix it ourselves. Give me this. Masino, you realize this is a great sacrifice for us? I do! Then I'll help you if you help me, hear me? Oh Lord! First my daughter, then my husband... Tancredi, you know why all this happened? - Why? - Because of you. Me? My father started beating me, I was here asleep. And who scratched the car? If you hadn't scratched the car, all this wouldn't have happened. And remember, Masino came here because your mother called him. If she hadn't, he'd be home now. Is it right he should bear this burden alone? If you and your father hadn't argued, nothing would have happened. You can't put me on trial now, I just scratched the car. It's my father's fault for beating me up. Now, it almost seems like I shot him. Your poor father, he had his faults, but he paid, and how! May he rest in peace. Now we have to work out how to keep going. You with all your owing, tell me how we'll all keep going. If Masino goes to jail, we're out on the street, your mother and us too. Tancredi, you know what it takes to support five people? A real job, not temporary with a salary at the end of the month But who will give you a real job? We can sell the car. We sell the car... But even then? Come here. Masino doesn't have a regular salary but he brings money home. What do you earn? - Who knows, maybe... - I don't care. Tell me something we're all interested in. Are you sure you can support all of us, you and your mother? Sure. Funeral, lawyer, you foot the whole bill. No problem. - A nice funeral. - A wonderful one. - A good lawyer. - Excellent. - Your word? - My word. Swear it! I swear it. What should I do? Don't do anything, nothing. Just be quiet and that's all. Quiet? Just be quiet and don't worry Do whatever they tell you to do, but don't say anything. Tancredi, don't worry Okay, but what will they do to me? They'll take you to jail. They can't keep you very long there are extenuating circumstances. We'll defend you, alright? We'll explain to the judge that you didn't want to kill him. We'll say it was self-defense. It was self-defense. So, I guess we all agree. Masino, you know what you have to do, we're counting on you. Now, go home and don't leave the house. Go! Come here, to Grandma. Come here. You go in there and lock the door. Remember, don't open it to anyone. No matter what you hear, be quiet and don't open it. Take this, my boy. Fonzio, do you understand? Yes, I'll just stay put here. Right, good. IT WAS THE SON
