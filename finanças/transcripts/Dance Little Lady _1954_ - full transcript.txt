My that poor doll must be dying on his feet. It's way past his bedtime. He's not a bit tired, he's practising for his school display and he's as fresh as a daisy. Well, that more than you'll be in the morning if you don't say your prayers and pop into bed. And what will mummy say to me then? Mary, she'll say, you're a bad nurse. I'm going to turn you out into the snow with a week's notice and no references. No she won't, she's too scared to do it, and anyway, it won't snow tomorrow. Oh, you're so clever, you know everything. Ah-ah-ah-ah, haven't you forgotten something? Come along young lady, your prayers. Please make me as wonderful a dancer as mummy when I grow up, so she'll be proud of me, forever and ever, amen. Oh, and please, no snow tomorrow. - That's a good doll. - Oh nice and warm. Oh, you're an old slow coach aren't you? - Mary? - Yes, my love? What's mummy doing now, this very minute? Let me see now, half past seven, she should just about be in her costume, ready to go on. And daddy'll be shouting at the top of his voice to the stage manager. I'm sure your daddy will be talking very politely and correctly to the stage manager. Oh everyone shouts at the stage manager, and he shouts back even louder, I've heard him. Well, you start listening for the sandman. I'll try, what about Patrishka? Fast asleep already, down you go, goodnight my deary. Goodnight. Sweet dreams. Sweet dreams to you too. Goodnight, Mummy. What's the matter, broken your leg? - That new girl hit me. - On purpose? I can't be sure, but I kicked her back anyway. I always said you were the sweet, helpless type. Were you pleased? I've seen you do worse, but you're still taking the whole of the first act to warm up. Oh, Mark. Was it really as bad as that? You know perfectly well it wasn't. But if you're only fishing for cheap compliments you've come to the wrong man. You've got to get to the very top and I'm gonna get you there. Well, any complaints about the tempo tonight? Was there any tempo? It was perfect tempo. Thank you, come down there and conduct yourself some evening and I'll stay up here and do the criticising. Fix it up with the musicians union, and I'll be right there. He jumps at scores who never wagged a stick. Don't take any notice of him Paul, you're the most wonderful conductor in England. Nevermind self-serving polling, you're in a draw, into your dressing room. Well, I was finally granted audience with the big wigs at Covent Garden this afternoon. - Yes, what did they say? - They agreed to my terms. He'll take over from old Gus as soon as we close here. Giselle. But Mark, how do you say it like that? Well I never had any doubts, this is what I've been working for. Mark I, I never felt so excited in my life. Or so scared. I'll work till I drop. You'd better, if you flop, I'll look the biggest fool in the business after the build up I've given you. - You've made me so happy. - And grateful too, I hope. Yes, I always will be grateful to you, always. And that's exactly as it should be. Come on, come on, come on, hurry up if you want me to drop you off home. Aren't you coming home? Of course, eventually, after I've chased up a few minor details. But this is our opening night. Nina, come here. I've got to arrange contracts, money, billing. You wanna be bored with dull stuff like that? No. All right then, the sooner I go, the sooner I'll be home, so hurry up, there's a good girl. Come on. Ah, this is all very wonderful but the more successful we get, the more our marriage seems to turn into a sort of business relationship. Well it has to be like that while we're still trying to get where we want to be. Once we're on top, we'll be able to relax a bit and enjoy a life of our own. Your career's just beginning Nina, success, travel, adventure, Rome, Paris, New York, and an adoring husband. Will you buy it? I'll buy it. All right, then we've got no troubles. Yes? It's me, am I in the way? Not at all Adele, come in. I just had to tell you how wonderful you were tonight. Oh thank you, coming from you that's something. You're not kidding, but I have to hand it to you, you dance like a dream, I'm so jealous I could practically slit your throat. Give me a cigarette. Has Mark told you the latest news? Oh no, he never tells me anything, darling. Well you'll never believe it. I can hardly believe it myself. I'm going to take over for Maude Goss at Covent Gardens. Oh that's, darling how absolutely marvellous, why is she leaving? She broken a leg, I hope? No, she wants to retire and get married. Hope she makes more of a success of her marriage than she did of her dancing. Meow, meow. Are you kidding, her arebesque's remind me of a one legged stork looking for somewhere to deposit an overdue egg. You are horrid, Adele, she's one of our greatest dancers. And as great dancers go, she went, R-I-P. Well, I've gotta go too. I can't tell you how pleased I am for you, Nina. I can't tell you, goodnight, Nina. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Adele. - See you later. - Not too later. Nag, nag, nag. Mummy, Mummy. Jilly, are you still awake? - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, Mary. I'm glad you're back, she's been jumping in and out of bed like a jack in the box, I haven't been able to do a thing with her. - Mummy. - Coming, darling. - How did it go? - Wonderful. Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, I've got a secret I've been keeping especially for you. Fine excuse, you ought've been fast asleep long ago. I couldn't possibly go to sleep until I told you. Madame Tamara has chosen me for the display, and Mae Thornton wasn't picked at all and she cried. Poor Mae Thornton. Poor nothing, she's far too big to cry, she's nine. Darling, I'm very happy you've been picked for the display but you should've waited till the morning to tell me... No, too far away. Well you go to sleep straight away, and not another word. Can I have one more another word? If it's only one. Well it's more than one but it's worth it, Mummy. Well? Well, the children in the display get a disploma. Mm, a diploma, darling. - Yes. - How exciting. And Mummy... Sh, we'll put it in a frame and hang it right over the bed. Will enough people see it up there? We'll bring them up especially to see it. - Goodnight, darling. - Goodnight. And Mummy... Shh. How's this for tempo? Half an hour ago you'd have been on time. Now, now, it's not polite to bear your fangs in public, what'll it be? Gin, if you're sure you can afford one. Neat? I'm nothing if not neat. Two gins, feel like a turn around the floor? What am I, a sardine? If I wanna get crushed to death, I'll let you know. I love you when you're not your true, gay little self. Well I'm sick of always being dragged to this cheap dump. What's the matter, are you ashamed of me or are you broke? I'm always broke. You're not that broke. Wanna go through my pocket? The moths will be glad of the company. We still didn't have to go slumming. You liked the place well enough a month or two ago, before I got you promoted from the background to chorus, remember, or is you memory getting too convenient? Maybe you'd like to go back, it could be arranged. - Now listen. - I'm all ears. The thing I admire most about you is that tiny little black heart of yours beating away like a war drum. And being answered by another. You double crossed me in cold blood tonight. To which particular figment of your highly coloured imagination are you referring? Why aren't I replacing Maude Goss for Covent Garden? Because you're not good enough, next question. You've the nerve of old Nick. I've got a practical mind. I've spent eight years on Nina, building her up, making the right contacts, supervising her at practise, almost dancing a perishing rose foreigner, why? Because I fancy myself as Santa Claus? You fancy yourself full stop. Eight years is time, and time is money. And if you think I'm gonna throw all that away for a pair of goo-goo eyes and a number of pose to the chasse, you're wrong. I'm a businessman, Adele, Nina's my investment. So what does that make me, a bouncing check or an I-O-U? What I've done for Nina I can do for you too, and do it twice as well but that comes later. Nina's gotta pay off first. And if you don't like it, you can lump it. We're in an overcrowded profession, find somebody who can offer you half what I can and I'll dance at your wedding. You know what you are, you're a... Yes, of course. Feel like tripping the light fantastic now? Why not, I can only die once. That's one way to get on in the world. For Adele, it's the only way. Does Nina know? Of course not, the wife's always the last to find out. Why do nice girls always marry heels? - There's a choice? - Well. Yes, come in. Hello, my sweet, don't you look smart. Mummy, you look beautiful, look, Mary and me picked these especially for you. - Thank you very much. - Hello, Daddy. Hello, peanut, you shouldn't have brought her around before the show, Mary. - I'm sorry... - But I told her too. You've never been backstage before, have you love? No, one day I'm going to be in the backstage, aren't I, Daddy? I wouldn't be surprised. Jessie, put these in water, will you? Now Jill, you must let mummy get ready. - Mummy. - Um-hm. I've got something special for you, my lucky peacock. And you can wear it for tonight. It's very efficacious. Thank you very much, darling. No peanut, mummy can't wear that tonight. But Mark? What, do you want to jinx your own opening night? What's jinx mean? You don't really believe that peacocks are unlucky do you? I respect conventions, if it's an accepted theatrical superstition that peacocks are unlucky, why tempt providence trying to disprove it? But Daddy, it isn't unlucky, I got through my history exam with it. Mark, for heaven's... All right, so I'm superstitious, you're not to wear it, and that's final. He's called Percy, Mummy. Don't worry, darling, you know what I'll do? I'll put Percy on the dressing table, shall I, right here. And he'll bring me all the luck I need, right? Yes. Mary, you better go to your seat, and hurry up. - Yes, Mrs. Gordon. - Wish me luck, darling. Come along, Jill, we want to get there before the music starts. - Daddy. - Now what? Please let mummy wear it, it is magic, honest it is. Look Jill, your staying up tonight is a very special treat, be a good girl, do as Mary tells you. Yes, Daddy. It's out this way. Oh, of course it is. Beginners please, beginners please. Beginners, Jessie, my shawl, please. Now don't get in a state. All right, all right, I'm not in a state. Now don't forget the change we made in your solo. Yes, yes, I'll remember. Hold that last arabesque as long as you can. I'll try. Don't forget the change now. Mm-hm. Keep your head straight during the pirouettes. Stand by, please. Good luck, darling. She did wear my peacock, I told you it was lucky. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Miss Petrov is very tired, I know you understand. Well, tell me the worst. Darling, you were wonderful. Oh, my love. If you go on like this, all our troubles are over. Next stop New York, and then the fatted calf, Hollywood. Hollywood? Yes, why not, this is just a sprat to catch the mackerel, the big money's not in the theatre. Once you've made a hit in New York the film boys'll be falling over each other to sign you. Mark, I'm a dancer. Yes, you are, and a wonderful dancer. And you'll dance for the highest bidder. No, I shall not stay, I know how it is, I'm hot too. Every step I've been doing with you, but I have to congratulate my old pupil on the night - of such a triumph. - Madame Tamara. What a triumph, my heart is bursting with pride. I weep like a crocodile. I'm so glad you came around, Madame. Mark, clear the flowers. No, no, no, no, no, I pop in and out again like a ping pong ball. But I tell you, Mr. Gordon, you take great care of this one... Don't worry, Madame, - I know it. - She is, do not let them turn your head, my love. It is still work, work, work. Mark will see to that. I stand over her with a large whip, showing no mercy. In this business, who expects mercy? I taught you and you have rewarded me. And now, I teach your little Jilly, and one day she will reward me too. Oh yes, you wait, it will happen, now I go, I'm exhausted. Goodbye Madame, and thank you so much for coming. Goodbye, Madame. Well, it looks as if you've made it, doesn't it? - Mark, darling, - You're a clever little. Just as we planned it all, hm? So you did wear it? Oh yes, but Jill was right, it did bring me luck. Why did you wear it, when you knew damn well I didn't want you to? But Mark, you're not angry are you? What sort of a fool do you think that makes me look in front of my own child? I didn't mean to do that, and I'm sure that Jill - never saw it that way. - All right, forget it, - forget it. - But Mark. I said, forget it. Hurry up and get that muck off your face we're late already. Late for what? Poli's throwing a surprise party for you at Adele's place. - Poli? - Yes. Bless his heart, you've got quite a fan in Poli. I promised Jill we'd all go home together. Jill's gone home already. No, darling, Mary's bringing her around now. No, I told Mary to take her home. Mark, how could you do that, she'll be so disappointed. Midnight's no hour for a child of that age to be traipsing around theatres. We'll see her in the morning. Could've gone home first and then gone on to the party. Look sweetie, you're a star now, not a nobody. Most of the time, your duty's to your public, but you've also got a duty to me and to your friends. Do you want Poli to think you've got too grand to go to a party he's laid on especially for you? All right, darling, of course I'll go. Yes, of course you'll go. Well hurry up then, get a move on. That's just wonderful, wonderful, come and get it. Darling, not that I wanna be difficult, but how 'bout a little finesse, is a plate too much to ask? Plate deary, then I'd have to wash 'em up. Come on, you lucky people, fresh sausages, all for the lot of ya, you just slap 'em on the head and they'll sit up and bark. From the Chef Cocadine to the Chef Burquett. One sausage, coming up. One sausage, going down. Does your wife eat sausages? Of course. Good, I've got one here I think'll choke her. Nina darling, how 'bout a sausage. Jan is a positive genius. I'm sure she is, but my tummy still has the first night shakes. Well how's your glass? No skimple. And that's the way it's gonna stay, early rehearsal tomorrow. Do you mind if I kidnap your husband just to help me with the rest of the food? - Oh, really, I should... - No of course not. Nigel was helping but he suddenly disappeared under the van, said he was looking for his lost innocence. Why didn't he tell me, he could have had mine. You look ready for bed. I am. Well, dearie me, don't stand on ceremony. I'll tell Mark to take you home. No, no, don't Poli. Mark is enjoying himself. Are you? Don't I look as if I am? No. I am sorry, Poli. This is such a wonderful party you've given for me, and I do appreciate it. Nonsense! I gave it because I appreciate you. Do you know that I just couldn't have done it without that friendly face of yours looking up at me. Oh, that's not what Mark said. Don't worry, Mark appreciates you. It would be nice if he appreciated you too. Don't you like my husband, Poli? I'm sorry. I'm a little dull and fond of you, Nina. I'll keep my mouth shut. Oh no, you won't. You'll open for another sausage. Uh, oh. Tiddle-little-dum music. You better get and straighten this out. Just a minute. That shade doesn't suit you. Hey, Nina. Come down off your high horse and get in. And for Pete's sake, don't sulk. I'm not. Well don't look so injured and badly used. You think so, I'm sorry. All right, Miss High and Mighty. Just because you're a star at last doesn't impress me all that much. I'm the guy that put you there. Mark, I don't want to quarrel. Then wipe that superior look off your face. Would you please leave me alone. # Da, da, da, da, dee, da, da, # # Da, da, da, da, da, dee, da, da # Mark, drive slower. Please, watch out. Be careful. Well? Well? Your wife is still under the anaesthetic. How long is she gonna be? How bad is it? There are major internal injuries and her left leg is broken. Her leg! Oh, the broken leg will heal. But what? She's Nina Petrov isn't she. But what, but what! I'm afraid her career as a dancer may be over. What do you mean? You said her leg would heal. I also said the internal injuries were major. She may never be able to dance professionally again. Of course, that isn't certain. It couldn't possibly be at this stage. But I think it only fair to warn you to be prepared for a long road to recovery. Are you off, Mary? Yes, Mr. Gordon. Sorry it had to be like this, but you know we'd never lose you if it weren't for her leg - and that. - For her, I know, but, after five years, well. I'd better be getting home now. Let's hear from you Mary. Thanks again for all you've done for us. Bye, bye my pet. You won't forget your old Mary, will you. You'll like it at Madame Bayanova's, won't you. Yes, but, but. Oh Mary. There now my pet. There. Mummy won't be in hospital forever. And Jill, be a good girl to mummy. Help her all you can. She'll be very sad, a lovely dancer, never to be able to do it anymore. No. Oh no! Goodbye, pet. Jill? Jill? Coming, Daddy. Just wait in here a moment, will you please. I'm sure it's all right but I just want to make certain. Peanut, remember what I told you. Yes, Daddy. Tell it to me then so I know you haven't forgotten. I mustn't tell mummy about the house being sold. Or about Mary. That's my girl. And the other thing. I mustn't say I've gone to live with Madame Tamara. Good girl. And you really and truly won't forget. If you did, Jilly, if might give Mummy a horrid shock, and Mummy's so ill that a shock might make her. I won't forget, really I won't. Of course you won't, you love Mummy don't you. We both do. Yes, it's all right. The doctor says only one of you at a time, though. So who's to be first? What should we do, toss for it? Or do you want to go first. Let me go first, please, Daddy. Jilly! Hello my darling little one. Let me look at you! My goodness, you've grown! You're going to be needing a new coat. Well, only if we can afford it. Perhaps. - Mummy? - Mm-hm, what? Does it hurt? No my darling, it's hardly hurt at all, truly. How's Mary. - Very well thank you. - Did she send any message? No. I hope you've been a good girl and helped as much as you could. Oh yes. Yes, Mummy. Everything is all right at home, isn't it Jill? Oh yes. And at the dancing classes? Oh, the dancing classes! You know what? Rita Gillson's mother complained. My goodness, what about? Well Rita told her that Madame spoils me because you were her pupil too. We can't have that. I tell you what, as soon as I get home, we'll ask Rita and her mother to tea at our house to straighten things out, shall we? Yes, Mummy. Darling, are you sure that everything is all right? Of course, Mummy. Time the little girl said goodbye. Mr. Gordon's waiting for his turn. Oh, but she's only... Now Mrs. Gordon, you know the doctor said only a minute each. Say goodbye to Mummy, dear. - Goodbye, Mummy. - Goodbye, darling. Oh, Mummy, it's so dreadful! Oh, what is dear? Never to be able to see you dance again, ever. Why, whatever put that into your head? Mary told me. Oh. Never mind, darling. I'll, um, I'll be able to watch you instead, won't I. You wait with nurse, Jilly. Hello, my dear. How goes the battle, eh? Here's something for you to read. What is it? Has Jill said something to upset you? Mark, Mark, tell me something. Tell me the truth. Will I ever dance again. Well, what a, Nina. Try and be brave. You mustn't give in to it. Nina, please! We can be wrong. Just think of the times I've been wrong before. Nina. Nurse! Join your little girl, will you. Hello, give me the house surgeon quickly, please. Who is it! It's Mark, let me in, will you! - Who? - Adele, it's me, Mark! - Open the door! - Oh, all right. Why don't you get that bell mended. 'Cause I don't like being woken up at this unearthly hour. Unearthly hour, it's a quarter til one. - A.m. or p.m.? - Listen to me. Are you prepared to work as you've never worked before, all day and every day, no more late nights or drinking drags? - Are you crazy? - Listen I said. Are you prepared to do everything I tell you, are you? Are you? - Answer me, are you? - Darling. What is all this in need of? I had the final confirmation from the hospital this morning. Nina will never dance again. Well? You wanted to step into her shoes, didn't you? Sure I did, but not this way. Look, we've all got to live, haven't we? Hospital bills, Jill's schooling, I can't do that without a dancer, can I? Okay, you got one. You swear you'll work? Word of honour. You'd better. By heaven, you'd better. Sweetheart, it's so much easier to write this than it is to say it. Please don't think I'm ducking out on you when you're trouble. It isn't that. But what else can I do? I'm a manager, I've got to have an artist to manage. So I'm leaving tomorrow on a continental tour with Adele. She's not in your class, I know. But she's got talent. I can make something of it, and that way we can pay the bills. That way we can pay the bills. Well. You won't have to try and hide things from my anymore, Madame Tamara. And thank you for coming to the rescue with Jill. Nothing gives me greater joy. I adore the child. I spoil her horribly I know. She's a natural born dancer, Nina. How could she be anything else with such a mother. She has spirit and guts. A vulgar word but so expressive. Only wish I could have kept Mary on too. As if you hadn't done enough. Nina, don't answer if it's to soon to talk about it. But what plans have you made for when you come out of here? None yet, Madame. I won't be in urgent need of money for a while and now that Mark has sold the house, now that I can't earn my living anymore, the money has to come from somewhere. It needn't have gone where most of it's gone. That's his business. Well in my language it's monkey business. Well, I have to be going now. I'll come back tomorrow and bring Jill with me. Thank you Madame. Meanwhile my dear, never say die. You know, stiff chin, and all the things they do in this wonderful country. Goodbye my dear. Ah, the very man I was looking for. Good afternoon Madame Bayanova. Have you been disturbing my patient again? Of course, it's my hobby. How soon are you intending to let her out of here, Doctor? Well, she could be out of here now if she had the will to get out and go. Why won't she? You know the private side of the case as well as I do. You think it has broken her spirit? I never think is such sweeping statements. Is she afraid to come back into the world? - Wouldn't you be? - No! I'm a fighter and so was she until she married that worthless good for nobody. I could offer her a job. It's not the best in the world, it doesn't pay a large fortune in salary, but still it would be a job. - What as? - A teacher. Did you mention it to her? - No. - Why not. Don't third degree me, Doctor. She would refuse it in her present state of mind. And her present state of mind is not my business, Doctor, it's yours. I don't profess to work miracles. You doctors have the best of both worlds don't you. You get knighted for your successes and you bury your mistakes. Ah, yes, you may laugh young man, but somebody should be doing something to repair more than that child's leg. Do it! Gosh, I'd better get this straight. If Mabel saw it, she'd have kittens. Doc Ransom will be here in a sec. Oh, he's dreamy. I could fall for him like a tonne of bricks. Except he only cares about people who can't work or got broken arms or something. Anyway, I always said I'd never marry a doctor. All their wives do is just hang around waiting for them. All the same, I could revise my ideas for Doc Ransom. Oh, I say. Well, how are you Mrs. Gordon. - Good afternoon, Mary. - Good afternoon, Doctor. Well we can take this cage away for a start. We shan't be needing that any longer. You can put it back into the store. Yes, Doctor. Mrs. Gordon and I will have a little talk together. - Yes, Doctor. - Alone. Yes, Doctor. How long have you been here now, Mrs. Gordon? I don't remember. Why, it's nearly four months. That's quite a long time. Yes, it is. If a doctor is to do any good, the patient must have the will to succeed. And the kind of therapy I'm thinking of you for you, seldom works with people who chuck in the sponge. And I rather think, Mrs. Gordon, that that is what you are thinking of doing. You think I like lying here? Well, you're not doing much else about it, are you? I've tried to walk. - And you fell. - Yes. Do you want me to make a fool of myself again? I don't mind which side I sit, as long as you listen to me. Now you know, there are very few us that aren't struck by illness sometime in our lives. I had a little of it myself. I passed the time learning to be a doctor. I haven't had as many successes as I would to have had, but then what doctor has? But every now and again I get a letter like this. And they sum up my belief in human courage. Would you rather I sat the other side? Doctor, please! Dear Doctor, the new legs are fine. I still have the occasional tumble of course but very soon now I'll be doing be-bop with the best. Getting on a treat with the carpentry too. Well, never say die. He was a professional footballer. One of the very best. He lost both his legs in a train smash. He's got a wife and two children to keep and he's keeping them. He took up carpentry and he's making a go of it. And you don't have to chase around beds to look him in the face. I used to have courage once. I don't know how I lost it. I didn't meant to. But it's gone. Nurse, bring over an ambulatory chair will you? Mrs. Gordon and I are going on a little trip. Up you get. I'm going to make you ashamed of yourself by showing you a few characters who don't waste their sympathy on themselves. Come on. Hm, good, good. Those legs of yours are practically as good as new. - Surprise! - Oh darling! Oh you're walking! - Madame. - Hello darling. We were just coming, oh Doctor, we didn't know you were here. We sneaked past the nurse on duty. Why that's practically a capital offence, but now that you're here, I don't see there's much I can do about it. Oh isn't is wonderful, Mummy's as good as new. She is indeed! You know something? What? I think you're the best and tallest doctor in the world. Well, thank you. That's praise from Caesar. And Madame brought you two real peaches. Oh, Madame Tamara, you shouldn't have done that. It must have cost you a small fortune. Oh, I roll in money. I light my cigars with unpaid bills. But I'm desolate and jealous too. As soon as they let you out of here, you will take my Jilly away from me. You are all in the plot against me, I'm just a poor helpless old woman no longer able to defend herself against intrigue. Come on Jill. Show me the arabesque I taught you. Mind you do it perfectly. She comes on like a house on fire. Oh, wait a minute. Oh no, not like that, darling. Let me help you, come here, right. Shoulders down, that's right, that's so much better. Inhale, point your toes, hm. That's it darling, that's it. Why didn't I think of it before. I need my head examined. I'm a good teacher of ballet, Nina, but all I can do now is talk. The knowledge, the heart is there, the spirit is willing but the flesh it is much to solid. I cannot demonstrate anymore. It is time old Madame to bring younger one to her school. One who can do as well as talk. One like you. Would you really let me? Do you think I could do it? Why not, it's worth a try. For the payments, it will be enough, you shall take the little ones. Thank you, Madame. For too long they have been laughing at old sappy. Ah Jill, I know. Kiss me, darling. One and two and one and two, put your shoulders. And one and two, and one and two, stretch your foot as you close as much as up. And one and two, your feet Jill, don't forget. That's all for today children, thank you all. - Now don't spoil it. - Mummy and get clothes now, we'll be back soon, very good. Cigarette? No thank you, not with my catarrhal. Even the menthol ones blow the top of my head off. The Jackson child is coming along nicely. Won't last. Lionesses laying in wait to make a physical monster of her as it did to me. I was the apple of my mother's eye you know. And overnight everything started to go out and come in in the most extraordinary places, nothing every went back into the right place again. Now, mind you if it's Jill, she's gonna have the career her mother should have had or I'm a monkey's uncle as my cousin always said. Someone to see you Nina. Dr. Ransom! I'm so glad you were able to come. May I introduce Mr. Bridson our pianist. - Dr. Ransom. - How do you do, Mr. Bridson. So pleased to make your acquaintance. Well, now I have delivered him to the right address, back I go to my class. The bigger girls are already behaving like prima ballerinas. Temperament, the curse of art. Well, I'm sure you want to be private. No, really Mr. Bridson. - Sure? - Quite. In fact I'd like to hear your opinion of an idea of mine. Well I'm sure my opinions not really worth having, but as it is, I'd prefer for you to have it. Do you remember the day you took me through the children's ward at the hospital? - Very well. - You see, the classes we give for the beginners aren't unlike exercises you give for the children in that ward. Except that here it isn't just exercise. The children are learning to dance, there's a definite goal ahead of them. And I thought, perhaps, well. I was going to suggest that that you watch one of our classes and if you see any value in it at all, I'd like to come to the hospital and help with a few lessons every week. What a perfectly wonderful idea. I'd be delighted to come along and play the piano. Delighted. Well that's very good of you, Mr. Bridson. You know, I think you've got something there. There's a kid in the ward at present who won't let us do a thing for him. He just doesn't have the will to get well. The only ray of hope I can see at the moment is that he's fond of music. - My guinea pig? - Your guinea pig. Good. Are you quite sure there's no danger? Oh, any effort of movement that you could get him to make would only be for the good. But I think you ought to have him here. A change of atmosphere. With the others? No, by himself for the first I think. But, it's so terribly exciting. It's, like, being on the verge of discovering penicillin or something. Terribly exciting. - Watch for the chair. - I must be a great klutz. No it's so terribly exciting. Closed, up and stretch your foot when you do it, Peter and close. You see, just like the ballet dancers do it. Would you like to try it? - No. - Why not? You want to get well don't you? - No. - Of course you do. If you'd only just try it you'd soon be able to do it much better than any of the other children. Peter, please try. If you ask me, what he needs is a good spank. Sh. No, I know just the way he feels. I've got to find a way to reach him. Do you want to go out and play with the other children, Peter? - No! - Why not? I don't like them. I don't like grownups either. - Not a single one? - No. He's gonna grow into a critic. Yes? Oh good morning, Doctor. - Good morning. - Hello Peter. Do you feel like working today? No. Where's Mr. Bridson? Oh, Mr. Bridson and I are very tired of teaching all day long, he wanted a little holiday. I brought a book for you to look at instead. Well that must be a weight off your mind, hey Peter. No more soppy dancing. Now you sit down and relax whilst I go and say how do you do to Madame Bayanova. I'll show you the way. Hello. Don't mind me. I've got just some silly old exercises. Down, down, down. Silly isn't it. And one and two and one and two. Up, hold, down. And one and two and one and two and one and two and one and two and one. Bet you can't do this. I could if I wanted to. Huh, that's easy to say. Bet you couldn't do it even if you did want it. Come on, I'll show you. It's easy when you know how. Really, really it is. Come on. I've got a bad leg. Well my mummy had one too but it's all right. She had crutches and a wheelchair. Now hold your hand onto the bar. - But I'll fall! - No, you won't. I'm frightened. No, you shouldn't be, now come on. Forward, back, forward, back. That's it, that's wonderful. Now the other leg. You beast, I hate you. You said you'd show me. You soppy thing. Just because you fell, - anyone might fall. - You knew I'd fall. You're no good unless you fall at first. Now you just get up and say you're sorry. - You knew I'd fall. - Or I won't show you anymore. - See. - Well help me up first then. You just get up yourself and say you're sorry. Go on, say it. Sorry. Show me again. Of course I will. Now, hold your hand onto the bar. Give me the crutches. Now, forward, back, forward, back. Forward, back, forward, back. Forward, back. Come and see here. So what, it's a free country, ain't it? Yeah, bit of free medicine too by the look of it. Well young woman, you've earned a gold medal. I don't think Peter will look back after that workout you gave him this morning. I'm looking forward to it again. He's really a very nice man and once he feels at home, you just got to make him feel at home. - That's all. - Of course that's all. Well from the tallest doctor in the world to the shortest nurse in the world, thank you. And again, my warmest thanks to you. They be dancing that kid again. Serves 'em right if she grows up into a dwarf. You've forgotten your tights. Tights! I'm not gonna wear those things. You have to if you want to dance. Well we proved what we set out to prove. If we can do it with Peter we can do it with 60% of the cases in the ward at present. You know, I hate to sound like Florence Nightingale. But I really feel I've done something worthwhile at last. We ought to build partnership together, you and I. Well we are in partnership in a way aren't we? What's the latest news of your husband? He's somewhere in America. I hear of him from time to time. You're still loyal to him? He's is Jill's father. This is still his home. I'm still his wife. Do you really think he'll come back here eventually? I have no reason to think to the contrary. He hasn't told me he'll never come back or asked for divorce. And if he did, would you agree? As long as Jill stayed with me. He's hardly likely to contest that. What would you do if you were free again? Oh, I haven't given it very much thought. Is that the strict truth? Well, I don't let myself think about it very much. Is that better? I think about it. Is that wise? Would you rather I didn't? Yes, I would. You're chiefly worried in protecting Jill aren't you? Yes, I am. Well if someone offered you both a home, once you were free, and Jill had no objections, would you have any? Are you asking if I'd marry you, John? Yes. Well that's a question I don't want to answer. Why not? Because I'm not free to answer that John. There's no hurry. Don't worry. You know these kids are very young, Joe, I hope you won't be disappointed. My wife's a teacher here and my own kid's a pupil. I didn't know you were married. Well, we're sort of separated. Listen there can't be much of a show left now. Look, we're here ain't we? Why have we got to lose? That's the girl I've been looking for! Properly handled she'll be worth a fortune. Well I must say I'm surprised too. I had no idea she was that good. Come on, let's go back stage. I'll settle a contract right now. Well I have to do a little softening of the ground with my wife first. I'll bring them back to you at the hotel in about an hour. Okay. We'll do that. Did you notice I nearly forgot my pirouette at the end. I though so, but you remembered almost at once didn't you. Yes, but I was paralysed and did you see Tanya slip, it was very mortifying for her wasn't it. Yes, terribly. - Hm. - Mark! Hello, Poli. An excellent display Madame. I was most impressed by my daughter. Hello, Doctor. - Do they know you're here? - No. I only got back from New York late last night. - Is Adele still with you? - Alas, no. Adele signed a contract with some promoter or other in New York and we parted. Uh, with mutual assurance of esteem and good will that neither of us felt. Where is the child's dressing room? I haven't the slightest idea. - Oh? - It's over there. Thank you. Well, see you all later. Forgive me now. Is it all right for me to come in? Yes, of course. Mark. Hello, Nina. Daddy! Hello, peanut! You haven't forgotten your old father then. - You're back! - That's right. And congratulations on your dancing, my dear. You're following right in your mother's footsteps. - Daddy, isn't it exciting! - Yes, it is. It's very exciting. When did you come back to London? I got back last night. And there's no need to kill the fatted calf because I brought it with me. I'm now a man of power and influence, personal assistant to no less a celebrity than Joseph Miller. Who's Joseph Miller? A producer, director, writer. He's over here looking for the cast of his next picture and I'm his official talent scout. I've got a suite at the Savoy and an expense account as long as your arm. Come back with me now and I'll feed you as you've never been fed before. What do you say, peanut? Oh Daddy, I'm ever so hungry. That's all I wanted to hear, come along my dear. - Mark, I... - Now we mustn't argue in front of the child. Come along. Just as well. Bye bye. Now her troubles start all over again. Not only hers, the child will have her troubles too. And I have a feeling we will all get our share of the backwash. Well, things have turned out pretty nicely, haven't they? Jim thinks the sun rises and sets in my pretty blue eyes. To our joyous reunion. You're very quiet. Still angry with me. It never does any good to be angry with you. No, my dear, just like water off a duck's back. But I mean well. - Dinner is served. - Right. Dinner is served. Fall to, young girl, you're the one that was hungry. Peanut, I can't tell you how nice it is to see you again. Glad to see your old father? Yes, very. But I don't know where you'll be able to sleep in our flat. It's so small. Well it looks as if I shall have to stay here by myself, doesn't it. Who knows, if things turn out the way I want them too, maybe you'll be living here too. Eating like this every day. As much as you can tuck away. All you've got to do is be extra nice to Mr. Miller when you meet him. - What's Mr. Miller? - He's my boss. He makes films. If he likes you he'll take you back to America to make a movie star out of you. How would you like that? What do you think, Mummy? Well, darling I... Why Mummy would be tickled pink, wouldn't you Mummy. Suppose we cross that bridge when we get there. That bridge is as good as burned behind us already. He's over there, go, get away with you. Get out of here, go on, scram! Scram you two, go on, away with you. Does Mrs. Gordon live here? Top floor. Thanks. Another boyfriend she's got. You know you'll have your nose cut off one day. You tryin' to be funny? No, prophetic. Aren't you going to ask me in, or do I have to show my pass? Bit of a dump isn't it? - The best I can manage. - Where's Jill. In there asleep. You want me to wake her up? No, it's you I want to see. Miller wants to do a screen test on her. What happens if it's successful? He'll put her under contract and we'll take her back to Hollywood. - Who's we? - Miller and me. And where do I come into it? Or don't I? I was gonna get around to our private problems later. As long as we see eye to eye on Jill, I'm prepared to be accommodating. Will you explain that more simply? If you want a divorce I can't call it an unreasonable request. So that you can marry Adele? If I did I'd need a good psychiatrist. You see that bite that's the hand that fed her. What are you really trying to say, Mark? I've been a rotten influence in your life and I'm ready to bend over backwards to make amends. You deserve somebody better. Let me have Jill and you can divorce me and marry whoever you want too. I understand and I've got my answer ready. Do you want to hear it? It won't be very flattering. Flatter away, I've got a broad back. The last thing I'd ever allow you to do is to exploit Jill. Making a fortune for her is exploiting her? Do you love her? Of course I do. So you prove it by trying to take her away from me. You see I do love her and I don't look at her as a cold-blooded investment. I kept her home intact and secure and clean and all you want to do is to peddle her at the nearest market. Well, Mark, you won't. My word, you do hate me, don't you. No, I don't hate you. Well, this alters the picture quite a lot doesn't it. You'll have to see Miller and tell him it's all off. It has nothing to do with me. He'll never believe you turned down a chance like this, he'll think I'm sticking him for more money. I'll bring him here and you can explain. You're not bringing him here. All right, then come to the Savoy. But Mark, you're being ridiculous. He leaves on an early plane for Paris in the morning. - I can't. - You'll have to see tonight. Why not. There's no one to leave with Jill. She's sleeping like a log. But I can't leave her alone in the flat. Well you must go out in the evening sometime. I've got a babysitter who comes in if I give her proper notice in advance. Look, it isn't as if you'll be gone all night. I've got a car downstairs. - But Mark. - I'll have you back in less than an hour. All right, I'll get my coat. Yes, of course you will. Yes, of course, sure I understand Mrs. Gordon. I'd feel the same way myself if it was my kid. I'm certainly glad you're taking it like this. He was dead set on getting Jill. I'm very glad you came over here to tell us how you felt. We're not such bad people after all are we. No, you both seem very understanding. Now that everything's ironed out, to everyone's satisfaction, how about a little drink. No, thank you, I really must be going. You've been very kind. Not at all, I hope we meet again when I come back from Paris. - Good night. - See you later, Joe. Where are you going? I'm just going to take Nina back to the flat. I want to talk with you. Could you go on ahead Mrs. Gordon, or better still, I'll have my chauffer run you home in my car if it's all the same with you. - I can easily get a taxi. - Yes, do that. It's very important business otherwise I wouldn't inconvenience you. - Not at all, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Nina. - Goodnight. What's on your mind? I don't like to do this in front of your wife, but if you don't get that kid on the contract, you're fired. - Fired? - You heard. I don't pay people just to sit around and look beautiful. You don't think I want the kid under contract just as much as you do? Okay, then get her. - Adele! - Hello. I didn't know you were in England. Nor does Mark, he ditched me in New York. Had to work my way back home. You and he together again? No, of course not. Well if he wants you to take him back, take poison first, he's the biggest heel on two hooves. Oh and that crook Miller he's working with is nearly as big. Thank you for telling me Adele. You're welcome, so long. - Adele! - Yep, in person. In third dimension and on a wide screen. Well, for heaven's sake, when did you get back to England? Oh, a day or two ago. Well, you've done very nicely for yourself and Mr. Miller, haven't you. Give me a drink before I tell you what I came here to tell you and take one yourself. - Now look, Adele... - You walked out on me didn't you. When I didn't have a nickel. I walked out, as you call it, when neither of us had a nickel. The two of us were getting nowhere fast. On your own a girl like you stood a chance. Oh. I realised that I was just a dead weight, I did it for your own good Adele. I hear fiddles playing. Give me that drink. When I met Miller and fell into a job, I came back for you but you'd checked out. Checked out? I had to do a moonlight flip. Fine you can give me some pointers, I'm gonna have to do one any minute now, I just got fired. Didn't take him long to get wise to you. Here's to Miller, I hope you starve. Listen, I've done some pretty stinking things in my life, one way or another, but this time I'm trying to do the right thing for my kid. - Poor little... - Shut up and listen - for a minute. - I'm all ears. Miller wants the kid under contract, you realise what that means Adele? What does that mean to me? Jill can grow up with no money troubles, a kid with her future secure. In fact, all our future's secured. - But Nina says no. - Nina doesn't trust me. I wonder why. Look at me, Adele. You believe me now? Only because I'm not very bright. Between us we can still work this thing. What I want you to do is call on Nina tomorrow night. She won't be at home. But you're gonna kick up a fuss that the neighbours can't help hearing. It's as simple as that. I don't understand, what do you... You don't have too. The less you know about it the better. But you'll be helping the kid. Did you think all that up while you were kissing me? I can think up a lot more. Yeah, you and Rasputin. Entrechat assemble and a one and a two. Nina, telephone. Oh, carry on Jill. Mark. Hello? Hello, Nina? This is just to give you time to order up your babysitter, Miller wants you to have supper with him tonight. Why, Mark? There's nothing more to talk about. Now look, I've done everything you wanted, haven't I? I've been a good fellow, haven't I? Well the least you can do is be sociable. Maude Goss and her husband are coming. Look, Mark... Now don't be difficult, Nina. Eight o'clock unless you can't get your babysitter in which case ring me back and I'll make your apologies. Otherwise I'll expect you. Bye for now. - You know something? - Mm-hm, what? You look like a princess. Thank you darling. I wish I felt like one. Is Daddy coming to live with us again? Do you miss him very much my sweet? Where's Uncle John been lately? He's a very busy doctor. I suppose his lady patients make too much fuss over him. Mrs. Gordon, your legs are practically as good as new. Oh, that's Gladys, jump into bed. Be a good girl, do you think you'll be warm enough? Yes, yep. Darling are you sure you'll be all right with her? Oh yes, Gladys and I are close friends. She tells me wonderful stories about the movie stars and their gold swimming pools. Um, I think that Gladys exaggerates a little. Goodnight, I won't be late. - Sweet dreams. - Sweet dreams. And they have platinum cars too. You just go to sleep in your wooden bed. - Hello, Gladys. - Hello, Mrs. Gordon. My dear, what a lot of luggage. I thought I'd do my nails and set my hair, you don't mind do you? No, of course not. You make yourself some cocoa or something, you know where everything is. Oh yes, I just love my cup of cocoa. I shan't be home before 11. Okey-dokey. And no stories tonight, please. Okay, have a good time. - Thank you. - You're welcome. # Da, da, dee # # Dee, dee, dee, da # # Da, da, duh # # Dee # Hello, Saint Days Hospital? Dr. Ransom please. I'm sorry, Dr. Ransom is not expected here tonight. Do you know where I can get him? He's not at his consulting room. Look I am speaking for Mrs. Gordon, if you should happen to see him by any chance, would you tell him that Mrs. Gordon will be waiting for him at the usual place after all? Well, I'll tell him if I see him, certainly. You're welcome. Did you know Dr. Ransom was running around with Mrs. Gordon? Oh! Oo. This is Mrs. Gordon's residence. Hello, is that the babysitter? Gladys, well Gladys, this is Dr. Ransom here. Dr. Ransom, yes. I'm speaking for Mrs. Gordon. She asked me to phone you and tell you that we're both on our way back to the flat. Oh, are you? And there's no need to wait. Three's a crowd if you know what I mean. And don't worry about the money. Mrs. Gordon will pay you in full when she sees you tomorrow. Okey-dokey. But she does understand it will be the full seven and six? Yes. Well you see I was sort of under contract for the evening. Okay, I'll pop in and collect it tomorrow, bye. # La, la, da, dee # # Duh, duh dee # # Da, da, da, dee, dee # # Da, da, da, da, dee, doo # # Doo, doo, doo # # La, da, da # # Dee, dee, dee, # # Da, da, da # # Da, da, da, dum # - Am I the first here? - You are. - Aren't you going to dress? - Yes, in a minute. Can I get you a martini? Yes, thank you if you're having one. I'm glad we've got a few minutes to ourselves. I wanted to warn you in a friendly sort of way, there's a lot more chat than you might credit about you and Dr. Ransom. - What sort of chat? - Oh the usual. - Did you believe it? - Why should I? Well, then there's nothing more to be said about it. Nothing. I suppose there isn't the possibility that he's in love with you? Without you realising it. Listen, Mark. He's been a very loyal friend to me. Hm. Do you see a lot of each other? At the school, yes. Some of the children are his patients. But he doesn't mean anything special to you one way or the other? Why are you asking me all these questions, because you do believe what you've been hearing? Because I'm prepared to help you if you want me too. In what way? These are Adele's letters to me, hotel bills and things. Any court in the world would grant you a divorce if you put this stuff in as evidence against me. You can have them free, gratis and for nothing. And divorce me as soon as you can get the case on the lists. In exchange for what? You're not very charitable are you, why should there be any exchange of anything. Because I know you so well, Mark. Can't I make a noble gesture for once in my life? So that's why you asked me to come here, it's not to meet your friends is it? You lied to me. I just asked you here a little earlier so that I could appeal to you quietly and sensibly to reconsider Jill's future. If you let her sign that contract with Miller, I can't steal the money from her, even if I wanted to. It's all watched by the courts, all I want is a chance for the kid to be a big star. If she fails then the contract will lapse and she'll come back to you. And if she succeeds? You'll be in control of her career. Well for Pete's sake, Nina, that's only reasonable isn't it? Then why do you want to let me divorce you? That would give me custody over Jill. Not if you approve the contract in advance, it's here, would you like to read through it? - No, thank you. - Why not? You must think I'm awfully naive, Mark. I couldn't put more cards on the table than I have already. If your friends aren't coming I'd like to go home. There are five copies of this thing, I've signed my part. There's a pen on the desk. If you sign your part those bills and letters are yours and we have no further interest in common but Jill's career. Makes sense, Nina. Everybody comes off better for it. - Except Jill. - You'd sooner she was poor? She might be that anyway in your hands. Let's keep this on a friendly basis, Nina. I'm sorry, Mark. But I see no reason... Then let me give you one. You're no leaving this room until you see sense. But this is quite stupid, Mark, you can't keep me here forever. I won't have to. Your babysitter's gone home. She thinks you're out with Dr. Ransom and so does the hospital. And Jill's alone in the flat. Make yourself comfortable, Nina. The night is yet young. But Mark, you can't... You're the one that's forcing me to be tough. And I'm being tough, Nina. Anytime now Adele will call on you at the flat and find you're out. Then she'll ask all the neighbours where you are and why the child's alone in the flat. Then they'll raise the alarm and start looking for you, but this isn't where they'll look. And you better hope that Dr. Ransom has a watertight alibi, because if he hasn't, I'm naming him as co-respondent in my divorce proceedings. How can you do this to your own child! I'm only doing what's best for her. My way, she can have money, a future and the best of everything. You're the one that's forcing me to be tough. There's a pen and there are the contracts. All right, all right. I can't get into the Gordon's flat - and I can smell burning. - Burning? There's something on fire. Oh, I'll come up right away, Ma, you come too. Jill! Jill, open the door, dear. Jill! Ma, call the fire brigade! Jill! Jill! Jill! - Where's her mother? - She's out. Yes, quick! Is there anything I can do? Yes, help me to pack my things! Look, there she is! - The kid! - Where? At the window! Her mother ought to be lynched for leaving her like that. Lynching's to good for her. Aren't you going to answer it? Whoever it is can wait. Oh, for heaven's sake, do answer it. I won't scream if that's what you're afraid of. But please don't let it go on ringing. Yes? Mark, everything's gone wrong. The place is on fire and the kid's cut off, they can't get to her. Come as fast as you can. - Come on, quickly! - But what is the problem? Never mind that, just come. Where is she! She's trapped on the roof and they can't get to her! Jill! You can't go Mark, no! No, no! Oh! Can I get out on the roof? Yes, is it going to be all right? Hello, peanut! It's Daddy, I'm coming for you. Now peanut, you've got to be a brave girl. And keep very still. We'll soon have you safe on the ground. I'm gonna throw her. On three! One, two, three! Jump, jump! The roof's going. She's not badly hurt, Nina. The burns on her left arm only first degree. Mark's coat protected her face and body, I've given her a sedative. She may remember very little when she wakes up. Do you want to see her? Yes, please. - Hello, Mummy. - Hello, my sweet. Is Daddy all right? Yes, Jill, he's all right. He was awfully brave wasn't he? Yes, Jill, very brave. Now you try and get some sleep. You're not going to go away again, are you Mummy. No, darling, of course not. Uncle John, and you won't go away either, will you. No, Jill. We're going to stay close beside you til you're quite better. 'Cause Daddy will probably be going a long way away again. Now you try and go to sleep like a good girl. And pretend it was all just a nasty dream that's all over now.
