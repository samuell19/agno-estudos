Lights on. Hannah! Breakfast! Come on! Okay, so somebody hacked into the school website. I used Spanish goat cheese this morning. They changed Melanie R's grade to a D and Melanie P's grade to an F. It's got caramelized onions, heirloom tomatoes, and basil, because I know how much you love basil. Are you even listening? Yeah, I'm listening. The Mels are your best friends, I know that. Frittata breakfast special, huh? Yeah, Dad, I'm a vegan. Ugh, come on, again? I know, I'm sorry, but me and the Mels keep changing our minds. Okay. Uh, do you want my oatmeal instead? I would love to, but I actually I have to get going. No, no, no, I could put it in a mug, you could take it with you! No, I have to get going, I'm sorry, I'm gonna be late. Bye, Dad. I love you. Love you, too. Okay, well, I'll try this. There we go. Mmmm. Not bad. Not bad at all. Good morning, Andrea. How are you? Maggie, I have a meeting with the board in 20 minutes, so can we please just cut the small talk? Um, yes. As you know, the market for our current product line is pretty saturated, so I've been developing some new ideas. I should hope so. You are VP of Product Development. What have you got? Gourmet frozen food. I want to create an exclusive new gourmet frozen food line for the company. Gourmet frozen food? Interesting. I've been researching several different options with Doctor Scully at the lab, and we have focused in on a chef named Hank Daniels. He owns a one star Italian restaurant called Osteria. There are only six starred restaurants here in Seattle. Really? Have you been to the restaurant yet? What was the name again? Osteria. Yes, I've been a couple of times, and it's delicious. Amazing. Hmm. Website needs some work, but, uh... Have you spoken to the chef about doing a frozen food line? Not yet, I wanted to run it by you before I moved forward. Gourmet frozen Italian food. I like it. Go back, try some more dishes, talk to the chef, see if we can get him on board. Great. Thank you. Good morning Hank, how ya doin'? Good, Bern. How are you? Good. Hey, did you know that your niece is a vegan? Again? Again? Yeah. Well, she is 15, and I seem to remember Karen becoming a vegan for a while when she was about that age, so... Hmm. Anything new on the lunch menu today, chef? Nope. Nothing new. Just same old same ol'? It's not the same ol' same ol', Bern. It's a classic menu. Customers love the classics. Right. Mmhmm. Classic. Yep. You're the chef. Yes, I am. Okay. Hot behind. Go ahead... Veal apple salad. Great. And Tortellini, can you take that? Behind you. Okay, service. Hi. Thank you, very much. And calling out two gnocchi. Yes, Chef. Two carpaccio. Yes, Chef. Thank you. Chef, Katherine Cooper's here again, and says your lobster risotto is still the best in Seattle. Tell her that, uh, that's very nice of her to say, and then comp her dessert. Yes, Chef. Okay, how long on that carpaccio? Two minutes, Chef? Good. Manny, I... I thought I paid that bill last month. I'm sorry, but I'm still gonna need to get that Wagyu beef delivered today. Please? I... I promise I'll... I'll get you taken care of next week. Thank you. I... I owe you. Thank you. Um... So, I'll start with the tomato carpaccio with burrata. Very good. And then I'll have the compressed apple salad and the prosciutto pappardelle. Perfect. Followed by the wild mushroom pizza and the lobster risotto. Will anyone be joining you, Miss? Oh, no, no, it's just me. Excellent, I'll bring your wine out right away. Thank you. Oh... uh... Excuse me, uh, forgive me for saying this, but that's an awful lot of food for just one person. Yes. I can never decide what I want to order, so I end up just getting everything I like, and taking a big doggy bag home. You would be amazed what you can freeze these days. One more? No, two. Thank you. Hank, it's happening. What's happening? She's here. Who? The gourmet food guide critic. Seriously? Are you messing with me? Table 12. How many? Just one, but it's just like you said, she's dressed conservatively and sitting alone in the middle of the dining room. She ordered two appetizers and five main dishes. Seven in total. Yeah, and that's before dessert. Any wine? One glass, a dry Chianti and a mineral water. This has gotta be it, right? This has gotta be it. Yeah. It's gotta be it. Okay, everybody, listen up! One of the top food critics in the nation is dining with us this afternoon. This is what we've been working for for the last four years. So, follow my lead, breathe, and execute. I'm gonna get us that second star today. Here we go, come on, let's go, people. Yes, Chef. All right. Hi, good afternoon. How is everything? Are you enjoying it? Excellent. Thank you so much. Hi there, uh, well, my name is Chef... ...Hank Daniels. Yes, I have your cookbook. Well, that's a great way to start a conversation. Um, can I interest you in a glass of prosecco? On the house, of course? Oh, thank you. Yes. Stan, one prosecco? Thank you. Um, I just love your food. Wow. But I hope you don't mind me saying, I'm having a bit of trouble following your recipes. Okay. What kind of trouble? Well, um, for one thing, they're very time consuming. Good food takes time. Well, not everyone has time to cook risotto from scratch. Ahh... Well, risotto doesn't really take all that long, it's just 25 minutes over a pot, and my risotto is worth the wait. And the measurements are not exactly precise. Your chicken cacciatore for example, it calls for a hint of sugar. What exactly is a hint? Just that, a hint. You see, I've... I feel that good food is more about feel and taste than it is about precise measurements. That's baking. That's not very helpful. No. No, I guess it's not. So, maybe my book isn't for everybody. But you seem to have an excellent palette. Let me ask you a question. Please do. Have you ever considered doing a line of frozen foods? Frozen food? No. Never. We don't even have a freezer here. It would make your food accessible to so many more people. Excuse me, I... I... I didn't order this. I am so sorry, sir, I'll have somebody come right away, okay? Could you please? Absolutely. Yeah, uh, miss, miss? Mr. Daniels... Oh! Oh, I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's alright... It's all... Here, let me just... Yep, that's okay. That's okay. I'm so sorry. It's fine. It's fine. That's okay, that's okay. I am so sorry, Mr. Daniels. Uh, no, no, actually it's okay. It's actually just Hank. I'm just Maggie. I mean, I'm Maggie. Not just now. Always Maggie. Right. Well, very nice to meet you, "always Maggie." Hank, excuse me, Hank. Uh, it's a bad time, right now Bern. Uh, there's a phone call for you in the office. It's, uh, it's Hannah. Oh. Uh, okay, I'm gonna have to take this. Yeah. It was a pleasure to meet you, "always Maggie." You too. Maybe we'll see you around. Okay. Okay. Hey, sweetheart. It's me, what's up? You did what? Seriously? It's really not my fault, Dad. I told you this morning that someone hacked into the school website. No, no, no. You told me you were a vegan. And that someone changed the Mels' grades. Ahh. Look, I just changed them back. No, what happened was, you got suspended. If it happens again, you're out, permanently. That's it. Okay, well, what do you expect me to do? They're my best friends. I know. Look, I just, I need you to talk to me before you do something that's going to get you into trouble, okay? Okay. 'Kay, come on, let's go. Okay, uh, Mrs. Hutton is next door, I already talked to her, so if you need anything give her a shout. I'm 15, Dad, I'll be fine. Yes, I know you are, but it makes me feel better knowing somebody's around when I'm at the restaurant, and that's what neighbours are for. I guess. I love you, very much. And I wanna know that you're safe. Okay. I love you too. Okay, good. Now, I gotta get going. Okay. Be good. I'll try. Hey, guys. Hey, Chef. So, how'd it go? Uh, my buddy from the gourmet food guide called five minutes ago. Already? Really, how's that possible? He spoke to me off the record. Okay, okay, good, good. And? Uh... We didn't get our second star, did we? No, Chef. I see. That's disappointing. Well, I guess one gourmet food guide star is still pretty respectable, there's only six starred restaurants in all of Seattle. I guess that's something. Why are you guys looking at me like that? Em, Bernie, what is it? What? You look like somebody died, you're freaking me out. What is it? Hank. What? No, no. No, tell me we still have our star. Our one star. Right? I don't under... I... I don't understand. What happened? What did they say? They said something about the service being slow, and the menu being stale. It's a classic menu. No stars, huh? Okay. Everybody back to work. Hank, if you need to take the day... No, I don't need to take the day, Brian. I could cover for you, Chef. No, you can't cover for me, this is my kitchen, we need to prep for dinner. She's not saying change the menu. I know what she's saying, Leo. Look, I appreciate your concern, okay? But I don't need any help right now. All right? Yes, Chef. Thank you. The chef's name is Hank Daniels. He has his own cookbook and an Italian restaurant called Osteria, and Doctor Scully feels that his recipes will be a great match with our flash freezing process. But while Hank's food is delicious, the restaurant has taken a turn for the worse over the past few years, and he's taken on a lot of debt. Which means business is down. So... We'd like to make him an offer. Good morning. Leo, Em. Oh, hey Hannie. Hey, Uncle Bernie. How's my favourite rebel? Oh, please stop. Don't encourage her. You go up to my office and do your homework, okay? What if I worked on the website instead? How about you do your homework like I just asked? Okay, fine. Come on. All right. So... Look, I just, uh, just wanted to take a second and apologize for my outburst yesterday. That was not cool, and I promise you it won't happen again. Ah, don't worry about it, Chef. It was a bad day. Yeah, it certainly was a bad day. It's not every day you lose a star. But I thought about it long and hard, and the way I see it, there's only one thing left to be done. And what's that? Get it back. That's what I'm talking about. We did it once before, right? There's no reason we can't do it again. Hank, there's some people here to see you. I'm kind of, uh, in the middle of a pep talk here. They said it's important. Okay, guys, get to work. I'll be back in a minute. Hey, I remember you. You're that food critic, uh... Always Maggie. You said my menu was stale. Um... No. Yeah, you did. Now, I don't know why you took our star... Wait, you lost your star? Uh-huh. But I'll tell you this, okay? We're gonna get it back, and then some. Well, that's good, because I like a hard worker. And this is not the food critic. You're not a food critic? No. Okay, so who are you guys? I am Andrea Fitzgerald, CEO of Flash Frozen Foods International. And this is Maggie Young. She is the one who's going to save your bacon. Literally. We wanna help you, Hank. Oh yeah? Help me how? Help you figure out how to make your bank loan payments. Bank loan payments? Hm. Bernie, what is she talking about? Well, um, ten years ago, Karen took out a business loan at the bank to get the restaurant up and running. Uh-huh. And after Karen passed, and I began running the restaurant, we started to get behind in our payments. Nothing that we couldn't handle. But then, the payments started to balloon, and after a while... So, what are we talking about? How much do we owe? I'm not... I'm not really sure, but I think it's close to 250 grand. $200-$250,000?! How could I not know about this? Because I wanted you to focus on the food because you said the business part makes you anxious. This makes me anxious, Bernie. Well, this is where we can help. What, you... you want to buy my restaurant? Is that it? No, we do not want to buy the restaurant. We want to move forward with some exciting new opportunities, Hank. What kind of opportunities? We are creating a new line of gourmet frozen meals. Gourmet frozen food. How would you feel about a line of Italian gourmet meals that you help create? Is this a joke? I will never do that. I am a gourmet food guide starred chef. Were. You were a starred chef. Hank. Do you believe in your restaurant? Yes, of course I do. Which is why I'm 100 percent committed to getting it back on track. Well, we believe in you. We believe in your food and we believe you are the partner to help us make this line a success. You're a great chef. So, why don't you let me focus on the business side of things? I've run a lot of restaurants before Andrea hired me. I can come on as a consultant, and you can use the money we're offering you for your recipes to revamp your restaurant. How much are you offering? We were thinking of starting with a step deal for 12 recipes. What's a step deal? We pay you a certain amount for every recipe you create. What do you think? I don't know, Bernie. I don't think we have much choice, that's what I think. Hannah, breakfast! Morning. Good morning. Okay. So, I combined the oats with almond milk, chia seeds, coconut, cardamom, cinnamon, a little bit of candied ginger, and it's got some vanilla and some grated nutmeg. Wow, you really went all out. Yes, I did. Deluxe vegan oatmeal for my favourite vegan. Yeah, Dad, I'm not vegan anymore. Oh, come on! You're killin' me. I know, I'm sorry, we just... me and the Mels just didn't want to come off as fussy. Okay, tell you what, how about deluxe vegan oatmeal for my favourite non-vegan. You know, I would absolutely love to, but I can't- No, no, no, you can't go. Sorry, I have to go to school, 'cause I'm going to be late. Eat an apple at least, okay? Okay. Thank you. I love you. I love you too, bye. Yeah. Okay, Yeah, well, I'll try it. It's really good, you're missing out. Good morning! Hank, Bernie. Morning. Morning. You want an espresso? Oh, no, thank you. I already had mine. I just have some paperwork for you to sign. Yeah, sure. I'll, uh, I'll have my lawyer take a look at it. Good idea. Do you have somewhere I can set up my laptop? Hmm, no, not really. Just my office. That'll do fine. Thank you. That's the bathroom. Yep. Mm-hmm. Well, looks like your office is now her office. I see you found my accounting system. Throw it in a drawer and forget about it? Yeah, pretty much. I don't really have a head for numbers. Then why are you managing the restaurant? My sister, Karen, used to handle all the business stuff. I was perfectly happy being behind the bar, I loved being behind the bar. But uh, when Karen passed, Hank kinda fell apart, and he only had time for Hannah and his kitchen, nothing else mattered. Okay, so you stepped in. Yeah. Hank asked me to take care of the business side of things, but Hank doesn't really like to work to a budget, so... It was difficult balancing the books. Well, first thing we need to do is get you set up with some restaurant accounting software. Um, remember when I said I don't really have a head for numbers? Hi. Uh, excuse me. Excuse me? Hello. So, as some of you might know, I'm Maggie Young, and I'm going to be assisting Hank in managing the restaurant while we develop a frozen food line. You know what, we're kinda in the middle of prep right now, so if you wouldn't mind... Yeah, I... I realize that, I just wanted to, uh, introduce myself and, um, see how you were doing. We're doing great. Thanks for asking. Great. Yeah. Great. Okay, well, um... Let me know if I can help. Okay. We'll let you know. Nice to meet you. I can't believe she walked in the kitchen like that. I mean, who does she think she is? She's the boss. She is not the boss. All right? She's just here helping out with the money part, that's all. That's right. Hank is the boss, Emma. But this was never supposed to be about money. This was supposed to be about great food. Well, now it's about frozen food. It's a nightmare, that's what it is. So, what do we do now, boss? Honestly? I think you guys should quit. I'm serious. You are both so good, you could get jobs at any restaurant in the country. You don't need to stay here just 'cause I messed up. No way, Chef. For better or worse, fresh or frozen, we don't care. Ehh. That's right. We are a team. Mmhmm. I don't deserve you guys. Yeah, that's true. I see you're, uh, making yourself at home in my office? Oh, yes, thank you. I'm just getting everything situated. Mmhmm. You know, if you wanna talk to me about the frozen food line, or if you have any questions about the restaurant in general, you can talk to me. In fact, you can talk to me anytime you want. Just talk to me in here, okay? Not in the kitchen, and never in front of my crew. Okay. Because I do have some ideas that are worth sharing. See, that's the thing. There's no sharing. All right? This is not a think tank. It's not a democracy. That explains why your menu hasn't changed in four years. Hey! No way. Okay. I see what you're doing. What I'm do- I'm making sure everything's in order. No, no, no. You are being completely transparent right now. Okay. I don't understand. No. It's so obvious that it... it's actually kind of funny. I don't get it. You want me to quit so that you can take over the restaurant. That's it. I know it. Hank. We don't want your restaurant. Oh really? You don't? No. What we want is to create the best gourmet frozen food line in the world. But I know you're not going to be able to focus on that, until your restaurant is back on track. So let's make a deal. We already have a deal. This is a deal just between you and me. I'm listening. You help me with the frozen food line, and I'll help you get your star back. Deal? Deal. All right, so where do we start? Well, you say that frozen food isn't any good. It's not. So, teach me. Teach me about great food. Yeah? Great. Lesson number one. Great food starts with great ingredients. Let's go. Come on. You said yourself, I have an excellent palette. Yeah, but that's when I thought you were a food critic. Oh. Okay. Oh, hi Hank. How ya doin'? I'm good. What do you got here today? Dungeness crab, fresh off the boat this mornin'. They look fantastic. Okay, I'm gonna take three cases. All right, I'll have 'em delivered to the restaurant. All right, that'd be great. Wait, wait. You can't do that. Can't do what? You didn't ask him how much they cost. She wants to know how much they cost, Georgie. Oh yeah? Who's this? New girlfriend? I'm Maggie. No, no, this is Maggie, she's a... Consultant. Consultant. She's a consultant. And I am teaching her about great food, and she, I guess, is teaching me how to stay on budget. Oh, wow. Better give her a good price then, huh? That's right. All right, 12 bucks a pound. Best price in the city. You sure about that? Oh yeah. But for you, I'll let you have 'em for $11.50. Okay, great. Thank you very much. You bring your consultant back anytime, Hank. Yeah, will do, Georgie. Thank you. Does he really have the best prices in the city? No. I knew it! But he does have the best seafood in the city, and that makes all the difference when it comes to great food. Hey. Look at these. Nobody takes the time to think about the food they eat anymore. It's because people are busy, they have jobs and kids, they don't have time to cook a meal from scratch. That's why the frozen food industry is worth $230 billion a year. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. We live in a hectic world, but... When you prepare a meal for your family, or for a customer, what are you really giving them? Good quality sustenance? No! No, not sustenance. Love. You're giving them love. Love is the number one ingredient in any dish. Without that, you've got nothin'. It's very romantic. It's true. But love doesn't pay the bills. You know what, we need to get you in the kitchen, because you need some hands-on experience. Oh, hands on ex... Woah! Hey, hey. You okay? Sorry. It's all right. Yes, just... embarrassed. I broke my heel. I can see that. You're lucky you didn't break your ankle. Here, give me the other shoe. Yeah, come on. Here we go, thank you. Hey, uh... There you go. Those were expensive. Mmhmm, and now they're practical. Time for lesson number two. Come on, let's go. Chop-chop. Fantastic. Thank you very much, have a good one. Hey. Hey, Leo, how we doing here? Doing good, Chef. Excellent, good. Got the invoice from the wine merchant. Oh, great. Can you put it in the office? Yeah, of course. Thank you. Getting the vendors to deliver early, huh? It's what I do. Hmm, that's great. I appreciate that. Same menu again tonight, huh? Nothing wrong with the classics. How are the potatoes coming along? Great, about ten down. Ten? Oh, you gotta pick up the pace. Oh. Let me show you. Okay. Oh. Yeah, that's amazing. Nothing to it but to do it. Okay. You got this. So, how's the cooking lesson going? Great. Not really sure what I'm meant to learn from peeling potatoes. Well, you gotta start somewhere, right? I also need to get back to the office. Yeah, of course, I completely understand. As soon as you finish. You know what? School's out for the day. Woah, woah, woah, hey. Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, what are you doing? You can't just walk out of the kitchen like that. Watch me. What are you guys smiling at? She's spicy, Chef. I like that. It's a little thick. More cream. Yes, Chef. Em, can you go to the back, to see if the truffles came in? Yes, Chef. Thank you. Here we go. Good on truffles, Chef. Thank you, how many we got? Five. Okay. How's the stock coming? Almost there. Excellent. Thank you, Bernie. Anytime. I'm just gonna go out and get some candles for tonight. Do you need anything? No, I'm good. All right then, I'll see you lat. We've got three cases of the Chianti, but we are running low on the Brunello. Well, that's odd. The stock report shows we still have a case and a half. Yeah, there was an accident in the cellar. Okay. Osteria, this is Maggie, how can I help you? Oh, uh, hi. You must be my dad's new boss. Co-worker. Is this Hannah? Yeah. Do you think you could tell my dad that my bus broke down? Oh. Um, yeah. He's in the kitchen. Can I have him call you right back? Okay, all good. Hank. Uh, not a good time right now. Hannah just called. Her school bus broke down. Oh, uh... Oh, oh jeez, okay. Um... Hey sweetheart, it's me, what's up? Hey, Dad. Uh, my bus broke down. Do you think you can come pick me up? It's gonna be like two hours till the next one comes. Oh... Gee, uh, I'm kind of jammed up right now. Can I send Uncle Bernie? Yeah, that's totally fine. I'll send you the address. Okay. I love you. I realize you're on a bus full of kids right now, so you can't say "I love you" back without sounding totally uncool, so just say "bye, Dad." Bye, Dad. 'Kay, bye sweetheart. Hmm. That was really sweet. Even I do have my moments. Just not in the kitchen. I'm in the kitchen right now. You know what I mean. Look, I'm the Chef, I have to be in charge, it's a lot of stress for any one person to handle. So, share the load. You don't have to do it all by yourself anymore. You have an amazing team here. Let us help you. Okay. I will. Hey Mel, have you, uh, you seen Bernie? He's not answering his cell. He said he had to go and get candles. Oh, candles, okay. I gotta figure this out. Um... Why don't I go pick her up? Oh, no, no. You don't have to do that. No, it'll be fine. Only if you think you can manage without me, though. Okay. Yeah, that'd be great. I appreciate that. Same team, right? Right. Same team. Why don't you text me the address of where she's gonna be and I'll go get my things? Okay, great, I'll call the school and let 'em know you're coming. Great. Great. Thanks, Mel. Thanks for rescuing me. No problem. Do you have lots of homework tonight? Oh, uh, no. I finished it all on the bus. Good for you. Yeah. What about you? Are you going to be working late tonight? No, I don't think so. Your father's pretty much got everything under control. He doesn't really need me. That's what he said. He said that? No, I'm kidding. Of course not. Of course he needs you. Do you wanna come in and hang out? It'd be nice to hang out with my dad's new boss lady. Consultant. I prefer "boss lady." You know, I do too. Yeah. Boss lady. Yeah. Sure, um, yeah, I'll come in, thanks. Awesome. One mushroom pepperoni pizza coming right up. I'm so excited. You've seriously never ordered pizza at your house before? Well, no. Dad insists on making it from scratch. Of course. It's good. It is good. It's not as good as Dad's, but it's close. It's pretty good, right? Your hair's really pretty. Oh, thank you. Yours is too. No, it's not. It's long and straight and boring, and I can't really do anything with it. I think your hair is beautiful. I had long hair when I was your age. You did? Yeah, and my mom always used to style it in an inside-out French braid... Oh. Sorry, Hannah. I wasn't thinking. So, you heard about my mom, huh? Yeah, I did. And I'm really sorry that happened. Thanks. My dad's great and everything, but uh... I really miss her. I bet you do. She had great hair, and she was so beautiful and had amazing style. Kinda like you. Oh, thank you. You could teach my dad a thing or two. About style? Yeah. Well, your dad, uh, he's a chef, he's gotta wear a uniform. Thank goodness. You should see him when he's around the house, he can't even match his socks. Hey, I have an idea. Do you want me to teach you how to do that braid? It's really easy. That'd be great. Okay, good. We'll do that. How about right now? Uh... Absolutely. Okay. So. It's really simple, it's almost like a regular braid, except you're going to go under instead of going over. Hey. Hey. Thank you. Uh, how's she doing? She's fast asleep. Oh, good. Well, I definitely appreciate that. You're welcome, anytime. Listen, you hungry? You, you want me to cook ya something? No, no. I'm stuffed. What, you cooked? No. Absolutely not. We ordered in. You ordered in. Pizza? Yes. That's not just any pizza. That's Captain's Pizza. It's delicious. Oh. You should try a slice. I mean, it's cold, but you could put it in the oven, heat it up. Hmm. Well, maybe I'll do that. Look, do you want to... do you want to stay and have a glass of wine with me, or? Sure. Yeah. That would be lovely. Thank you. Yeah? Mmhmm. Okay. I, uh, think I have some right here. Yeah, this one's good. You know, it's been a very long time since I've had pizza like this. It's pretty good, huh? Yeah. It's actually not that bad. It's frozen. It is not. Yes, it is. All of the crusts from Captain's Pizza are made at the frozen food factory, and then they're shipped to the restaurants where they're cooked and delivered to you. I did not know that. See, all frozen food isn't terrible after all. I see what you did. You ordered that on purpose. Well played. Thank you. Mmm. Although it's not as good as mine. No, of course not. So, you probably get asked this all the time, but how did you get interested in cooking? Oh. Well, that's simple. My mom. Aww. She's Italian, and she's a great cook. Better than any chef I've ever worked for. She's the one that taught me how to cook with love. Aww. Yeah. And she's also the one that talked me into going to culinary school. Which is where you met your wife, right? Yeah. Karen. Uh, she was a good cook, too. But she was a great baker. I'm really sorry. Yeah, me too. On weekends, she and Hannah, they'd just bake all day long. I loved watching 'em. Well, if you don't mind me saying so, I think Hannah is a really great, well-adjusted kid. Thank you for saying that. I think she's a great kid, too. Anyway, you know what? That's enough about me. How about you, anybody in your life? Uhh... My laptop? Come on, really? Never married? Once. Aha. It was right out of college, and then he got a job transfer to Chicago, and he took it, and now he's married to his assistant. Cliché. It really is, isn't it? Ugh. So, um, yeah, that sort of soured me on things, so um, my longest relationship is, uh, with my laptop. Well, here is to the lucky guy that steals you from that laptop. Oh, let's drink to that for sure. Hmm. Oh. Andrea would like a progress report, tonight. So, I should probably go. Right, I understand. Um, well thank you, again, very much for tonight, I really appreciate it. See you tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. I'm really looking forward to it. "Really looking forward to it?" "Really looking forward to it." Who says that? Nobody. Nobody says that. That's who. Don't look back. Don't look back. Don't look back. Lights on. Oh. Uh, good morning, Andrea. Hmm, did I catch you snoozing? No? Early bird catches the worm, Maggie. So, how are things going with my new favourite chef? Uh, they're, they're good, yeah. They're grea-they're great. Excellent. Now, I need you to get Hank into the food lab. Um, yeah, he's, he's working on some ideas, but uh, I might need a little bit more time in the restaurant, just to... get everything back on track. I want to get the gourmet frozen food line into production, ASAP. I, I just think that if... Stop. As much as I love hearing what you think, Maggie, what I need for you to do is to get Hank Daniels into the food lab. I understand, but the restaurant is... ...is not important. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Good. Get to it. Lights off! Hannah? Hannah? Breakfast. Morning, Dad. Good morning. Smells amazing. Yeah. What did you make? Well, seeing as how I never know what your dietary restrictions are going to be... I am not that fussy. Yes, you are. So, I made everything. Everything? Mmhmm. We have eggs Florentine, oatmeal, pancakes, omelette, fruit salad, even toast. And we have each other. We always have each other. I love you, kiddo. I love you, too. Now stop being so cute, cause you're gonna make me cry. What's it gonna be? Hmm, pancakes. Pancakes. Yep. I knew you were gonna say pancakes. All right. What are we gonna do with the leftovers? Ah, we'll just take it to the restaurant. Crew's always hungry? Right. Hey Dad? Mmhmm? Do you think Maggie's pretty? Sorry, what? You know, Maggie? Your new boss lady. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know who Maggie is. So... Do you think she's pretty? I don't know. I'm gonna... Yeah, well yes. Why are you asking me this? No reason. Yeah, you always have a reason. Just, be nicer to her, okay? Why? I looked her up. Awe. She's for real, okay? Very accomplished. Vice president of product development. Product development. Whatever that is. I just, I think she can really help you, if you let her. Yeah. Tell her she has nice shoes. Girls like that. Nice shoes? Uh-huh. Okay. Hey. Uh... Nice shoes. What? Your shoes. They're nice. Oh. Uh, thank you. So are yours. You... you know, for, for... um, kitchen shoes. Well, they... they are my fanciest pair after all. I generally save them for formal occasions. Hey, Stan. Can I talk to you for a minute? What's up? About the wine inventory... Hey, Stan. Everything all right? No, everything is not all right, Hank. She fired me. Who fired you? Your new boss. The frozen food queen. Maggie? Maggie can't fire you. Hold... hold on, just a second. No, I'm outta here. Good luck keeping this place open with her in charge. What? Hold on, just a second here. Hey. Stan just told me you fired him. That's right. Well, don't you think that's something that we should talk about? Well, that was the plan, but when I showed him the wine inventory, he blew up at me. That doesn't mean you get to fire him. He was stealing, Hank. Stealing? A case here, a case there, but it adds up. Over $3,000 this month alone. Hank, I'm sorry. I had no idea. Three thousand dollars, really? Wow, that's, uh... Horrible. Yeah, I know. Right. Well, who's gonna run the bar, then? I am, and Maggie's gonna manage the restaurant till we find someone new. Bern, you're the restaurant manager. But I am a terrible manager, Hank. We both know this. I mean, I never even thought to look at the wine inventory. And you're okay going back behind the bar? Oh yeah, no, no, no, I'm more than okay. I am over the moon. You want me to show you the wine inventory? No, no, it's fine. I uh, I believe you. So, this is probably bad timing, but I wanted to talk to you about going down to the frozen food lab. Right, yes. Uh... I am working on some recipes. It's just that Andrea wants to move up the timeline. Really. How come? She's excited to get started. And, if you get started working on the recipes, we will have money to renovate the restaurant. What do you want to renovate the restaurant for? People love it the way it is. Did you read the gourmet food guide review? No, no, I never read the reviews. Well, let's just take a look, shall we? Fine. "The formerly great Italian restaurant "has lost its way, failing to adapt and evolve. "The food, like the décor, has become stale." Okay. Okay. Thank you. You've heard of fish sticks? Sure, yeah, it was my daughter's favourite till she was about five. Well, during the early 1900s, the founder of Flash Frozen Foods International, Doctor Kent Fink, worked for the US government as a naturalist. Oh. Stationed in the Arctic, Doctor Fink was able to observe how the Native American people preserved their food for the winter. He returned from the Arctic, adapted the technology for commercial use, perfected it, and in 1922, began Fink Frozen Foods International. Hmm. But the name never really stuck, so his successor changed it to Flash Frozen Foods International. Fascinating. Our biggest seller, of course, is our classic turkey dinner. Over two billion units sold in the United States alone. But recently, we've been experimenting with a wide array of food profiles, like paella. Oh, I love paella. Uh, please, have a bite. Yeah? Okay. Um... That's not paella. Yes, we've been struggling with the rice dishes. Rice doesn't freeze well. The frozen pizza, however, is great. What did you think? I didn't hate it, hate it. Okay, well, it's a good start. Well, there's definitely room for improvement. That's why we need your help. Hmm. I gotta be honest with you, I don't think frozen food is ever going to taste the way I would want it to taste, but, a deal's a deal, right? That's right, it is. Yeah, I was afraid you were going to say that. Hey, uh, Chef? Uh-huh? We are out of Linguini. What? You serious? How are we out of Linguini? I... I... I'm sorry, I... I really messed up. How... how about we do the... the dish with, uh, risotto instead? No, we're not gonna do another dish with risotto. Do you want me to tell the wait staff to 86 the Linguini? Guys, come on, we're an Italian restaurant. We're not going to run out of Linguini. Okay, so what are you gonna do? Lesson number three. We're gonna make pasta. ♪ I wake up and I pinch myself ♪ We? ♪ You're with me not someone else ♪ Okay, making pasta is easy, all right? Alright, just follow what I do and we're gonna be great.

I like cleaning, it's relaxing. I can see that. You know, it's not dirty, though, it's just got a little bit of food on it, that's all. Don't let the health inspector hear you say that. Okay, I won't. You do realize of course though that we have a cleaning crew that comes in every night. Right. Yes. I knew that. Right. Oh, thank you. You're very welcome. You did good tonight, you're a hard worker. I do my best. I was very impressed. Yeah. So cheers to that. Cheers. Mm. Mmhmm. I was thinking... Oh boy. Okay, I was going over some of the food invoices. Wagyu beef-$110 a pound. Yeah, but that's the best beef you can get. I know what it is. Do we need it? That's what I'm saying. It's been on the menu since day one. And we are going to revisit the menu, yes? Yes, I guess so. Short ribs. They're delicious, and they're a tenth of the price. I like short ribs. That's it? Yeah, that's all I gotta say. Oh my goodness, I think we're actually collaborating. I think we are. Yeah. Same team, right? Same team. Okay. Short ribs. Hot behind. Hey, how's that salad coming? It's coming out now. Almost Chef. All right, fire two steaks, one medium, one medium rare. Yes, chef. And how long on that lobster? Two minutes, chef. Good. Hey, I was thinking. Oh, don't do that, you'll get lines on your forehead. Funny. I'll be here all night. So, you know how you're still serving burrata with heirloom tomatoes and basil? Yeah, it's a classic. Last month, I was at a wedding and they served burrata with grilled nectarines and mint. I see. Did they really? Yes, they did and it was delicious. Mm, how delicious was it? Oh, extremely delicious. You see, I didn't know that deliciousness could be extreme. Now you know. Uh-huh. Hear that? Burrata with grilled nectarines? Sounds good. It does sound good, doesn't it? Hey, Dad. Hey, sweetheart, what are you doing here? Uncle Bernie picked me up, and Maggie said I could do my homework in the office. Oh, your homework, huh? Yeah. Look at you go. I'm improving. Hey, hey, hey, come on. Well, you know what? This... Brain food. It's the kitchen! Bye. See that? All right, I need a new salad. I can't... can't hand that one out. That looks great on you. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I just was trying it on. No, it's okay, you could borrow it if you want. Really? Of course, yeah. Um, I wanted to talk to you actually, because your dad said that you designed the website for the restaurant. Yeah, it was for a class project. Do you think you could freshen it up a bit? Yeah, sure, but I think my dad likes it the way it is. Well, we're making some changes at the restaurant. New menu, new décor, new website. So, like a restaurant makeover. Sure. Yeah, something like that. That's awesome. So, what were you thinking for the website? Well, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe you could come up with some ideas? Of course. And I'll pay you, of course. Oh, you don't have to worry about that. How about I pay you in clothes? Are you serious? Sure. The restaurant's closed on Mondays, so I could pick you up after school, we could go shopping. That would be awesome. What if we started working on the website now? That would be awesome. Okay, so, what were you thinking? Like, what did you want to change? I want it to feel modern, streamlined, clean, and... kind of fancy? Okay. We're using blushes, and pinks, and white, and gold? I love that. Okay, so what if we changed that to blush instead and then like did an accent of gold there. Yes. So, what would you say that your look says about you? That I look like a complete geek. I want to change everything. No, not everything. You look smart and sort of geek chic. I want to be more chic than geek. Okay, okay, we can work with that. What does your look say about you? My look is business attire. I'm not quite sure that fits with the restaurant. Hmm. I think maybe we both need to change it up. Let's go in. ♪ You're something straight out of a magazine ♪ ♪ You got the brightest smile I've ever seen ♪ ♪ Oh, ho, ho, oh, oh ♪ Thank you. You're welcome. Hi. Hey! Whoa, look at you two. You guys look fantastic. Well, we told you we were going shopping. Yeah, but you never said you were going to buy out the whole mall. Okay, I'm gonna go upstairs and figure out my new wardrobe. Is there a lot to figure out? A lot. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you so much for taking her shopping, clearly that is not my forte. You're welcome, it was my pleasure. So, what do I owe ya? Nothing. No, the company paid, Hannah earned it. How'd she do that? She's redesigning the website. Oh, I can't wait to see it. Listen, uh, we were gonna go to the Monday night mashup tonight and do a little research for the frozen food line. You wanna come? What's the Monday night mashup? Ah, so this is it! So fun! This is so cool. It is. Oh, great! Arturo's is here. This is my favourite, you're gonna love it. Ooh, what's good there? Everything. You should let my dad order. Oh. No, I usually like to order for myself. Told ya. Control freak. I am not a control freak. Mmm. I just like things a certain way. Oh yeah? Well then, prove it, let me order for ya. You won't regret it, I promise. Fine. Yes. Yeah? Okay. Mmhmm. Okay, great. Hey, Arturo, how you doing bud? I'm doing good, and you? Good, thank you. Look, uh, today we'll do, uh, three enchilada mole poblano, we'll do three tacos Al pastor, and three of the tamales with the salsa Verde. Sure. Uh, anything else? Can I have a horchata? Yes. One horchata as well. Thanks, Arturo. Oh, you're gonna love it. It's gonna be so good. That was incredible. Mmhmm. You can always trust Dad to pick out the best food. Always. Oh, smile! Here we go. Oh. Okay, ready? Yep. Too goofy. What? Yes. Too what? Goofy? That wasn't that goofy, that's just my face. No, it's goofy. This is for the Osteria website, okay? As a story about our research trip. You need to be a little more serious. The what? You should see the new website. It's amazing. We're going to makeover the restaurant. I see. What happened to saving money? Well, the more frozen food recipes you create, the more money you make. And sometimes you gotta spend money to make money. I suppose. Everyone say "frozen pizza." All right. Oh. Frozen pizza. ♪ For the first time ♪ ♪ I'm waking up ♪ And then, I put in the order for the new flatware... Mmhmm. The dining chairs arrive tomorrow... Right. For the menus, I was thinking ivory linen paper, what do you think? Yeah, yeah, that sounds great. Nice. Okay. Why are you agreeing with me so easily? Uh, 'cause linen paper sounds really nice? It's not just because I'm slowly wearing you down with all of the details? Okay, maybe just a pinch. Hey, Hank. Hey, Stu, how you doing, bud? Good. What can I get for ya? Uh, well, today, I'm just gonna take, uh, a dozen short ribs please. Coming right up. Thanks. Short ribs, huh? Don't gloat. It's pretty hard not to. It just... I just I think it might work for one of the frozen food recipes, that's all. Oh. Yeah. Look, you know, I'm just gonna go back to my place and work on some of these recipes, I dunno, you want to join me? Sure. Yeah? Yeah. Okay, cool. Okay, here we go. Mmm. You know what I was, uh, thinking at the market? What's that? Clearly, this is a mistake to tell you this, but um... I actually think you're a good influence on me. No, don't be silly. No, no, no. I am being serious. I've, uh, been in a bit of a rut since Karen died, and you've pushed me outside of my comfort zone. Made me try new things again, and I, um, I'm very grateful to you for that. I don't know what to say. You don't need to say anything. Okay. Why don't you just try? But, be careful, it's really hot. It's a bit hot. Is it good? Okay. That's the best thing I've ever tasted in my life. Thank you. No, I'm serious, that's incredible. I'm glad you like it. I mean, it's actually really easy, you just braise the short ribs in, uh, some veal stock, homemade plum wine, rosemary, reduce it, serve it over the tagliatelle. I mean, normally, I would probably serve it over something a bit more substantial, like a pistachio risotto or something but... But Professor Scully said rice doesn't freeze well, so you went with the pasta. You know, you're pretty amazing, Hank Daniels. Thank you. You're not so bad yourself. Dad? Hey. Hi, Hannah. Hi. Hey. Hi. What are you guys up to? Well your dad made, um, uh, Pasta. Do you want some? No, I'm good. I actually had a question. Is this too much for school tomorrow? Yes. No. Thank you, Maggie. Goodnight. Night. Goodnight. Good job. Good influence on me, bad influence on her. So. I think I should go. Right. Mmhmm. I will see you tomorrow. Okay. And um, I have a surprise for you. Oh. I am really looking forward to it. Are you making fun of me? Just a pinch. Goodnight. Goodnight. I don't know, Hank. Oh man, that is good. Mmm mm. No, not yet. Okay, how about now, 'cause I don't like this at all. No, don't peek. Okay, I'm not. Open 'em. Woah! It's incredible. It's amazing. You did all this? Well, the interior designers did, but I helped. Oh, I have another surprise for you, too. More? Yes. Aww, would you look at that? That's amazing. You guys look amazing, the whole place looks incredible. Thank you. You're welcome. Look at that. Such a handsome chef. You guys don't look so bad yourselves. Check it out. Chef Daniels has some very interesting ideas about food combinations and flavour notes. I don't care about his ideas, Doctor Scully. Does it taste any good? Taste for yourself. Mm. That is delicious. We concur. Mmm. It's a game changer. How many of these dishes are from Hank Daniels? All of them. And you have all the recipes? Yes, we prepared them in the lab under Chef Daniels' guidance. In fact, we, uh, got a little inspired by him, and took his flavour notes, played around with them a bit and came up with some recipes of our own. Excellent work Doctor Scully. Get ready to go into full production. What is this, casual Friday? Oh, um... Sit. Yeah, okay. You have done a great job with Hank Daniels. Thank you. The frozen food line is coming along beautifully, and the restaurant is looking great. Ah, I don't care about the restaurant. Oh, I know, I just... Eye on the prize, Maggie. Gourmet frozen food line, that's what's important. Of course. In fact, I want you to start focusing on a brand new gourmet frozen food line. I'm thinking Spanish. I went to a great tapas restaurant last night, and the chef was just... What about Hank? We don't need Hank anymore. The lab already has plenty of recipes from Hank. They're taking his ideas and running with them. Well, that's not right. And, we promised to help him pay off his loan. It was a step deal. We don't need Hank to perform any more steps, and we don't need to pay him any more money. Well, I'm sorry, Andrea. I just don't think that's fair. Hank is pouring his heart and soul into helping us create this line. And he was paid very good money to do so. What's gonna happen to the restaurant? He's got employees, a daughter? Do you like this job, Maggie? Yes. Good. Then I think it's time to say goodbye to Hank, and move on to the next chef. Ordering two lobster, one panzanella, one ravioli. Yes, Chef! Thank you. Hey, Maggie. Hey Leo, Hey Emma. Hey, Maggie. Hey, packed house tonight, huh? I saw, yeah. It's great. Can I talk to you? Yeah, sure? What's up. Service! In the office, if you don't mind. Yeah, yeah, sure. Just give me a couple minutes, I'll be right there. Sure. Okay. Uh, how long on that lobster, guys? Right here, Chef. Excellent. Perfect lobster, Em. Thank you, Chef. Service. Hey there. What's up? Hey. Everything okay? Hank. You know I'm very fond of you. Oh, very fond of me? That sounds good. 'Cause, uh, truth is, I'm pretty fond of you, too. I mean, I don't generally go around kissing people that I'm not fond of. That's what makes this so hard. Okay... Not sure I understand. Oh, come on. It can't be all that hard. Andrea wants me to move on to a new restaurant. I'm sorry, what? I guess there's this Spanish chef, and, um... Another chef? I... I don't understand, I thought we had a deal. She says "the lab has enough recipes," and she doesn't want to pay you any more money. But the restaurant is doing better, now. I know. I just... just need a little bit more time. No, I know. And then you promised that you would help me get my star back. I know. So, what is... what is this? Is this some kind of game that you play? I mean you... What? You pretend that you like me, you kiss me, you take my daughter out shopping, and to get what, some recipes from me for a frozen food line? What? No, I would never... And after you get 'em, you... you... you... you just dump me and move onto the next victim? I would never do that. Is that who you think I am? I don't know who you are. Apparently, I have no idea. Look, this isn't how I wanted things to happen, but Andrea threatened to fire me. Should've quit. I wanted to. Believe me. That's the thing, Maggie. I don't. How am I ever supposed to believe anything you say again? You know what? I gotta get back to my restaurant. I'd really appreciate it if you weren't here when I got back. Hank... So what's up, Chef? What's going on? Just one minute. What's the emergency? Okay, uh, I called this meeting to let you all know that, um, Maggie is going to be leaving us, and that unless we find another investor, the bank is gonna shut us down by the end of the month. Shut what down? The restaurant. What? Wait, what? You, you can't let them do that, Hank. I can't pay back the loan, Bernie. It's not up to me anymore. Maggie wouldn't let us shut down, Dad. Andrea threatened to fire her. She said she had no choice. Well, where is she now? Well, I asked her to leave. Why? Let me get this straight. Maggie has done nothing but fight for us, and you ask her to leave? Is that right? Well, yeah. Are you serious? Ever since she got here, Maggie has been trying to help us. Uncle Bernie's right, Dad. I messed up, didn't I? Yeah. Yeah, you did. Hey. Hi. Um... Come in. Thank you. Uh, look, I owe you an apology. I said some awful things earlier, and I'm really very sorry. I... I was completely in the wrong. You have worked so hard for me, right from the very beginning. You pushed me, you challenged me, and it's only now that I realize that you actually made me a better chef... and a better father, and a better man. Now I know that I am losing my restaurant, and That hurts. But it's gonna hurt a lot more if I lose you, too. Maybe you don't have to. Have to what? Lose either of us. Really? I have an idea. Okay? Let's talk. Why am I here? Maggie. You said it was an emergency and I have a plane to catch in 45 minutes. Hank found someone to invest in the restaurant. Who's going to be foolish enough to invest in a restaurant that just lost its star? Me. I have a little money saved up. It's not a lot, but it's enough to tide the restaurant over until it becomes profitable again. Why would you do that? Because I believe in the restaurant, and I believe in Hank. Then I believe you're fired. I figured. I guess that concludes our business here this morning then Andrea. I still own your recipes. And you're welcome to them. I am grateful to you. I am. Because if it wasn't for you, I never would've met Maggie. You two deserve each other. Yeah. I think so. We could've built a food empire together, Maggie. You chose the wrong side. I don't think so. Thanks. What happened? Maggie just saved the restaurant. That's what happened. I can't believe it. And there's more... Not sure I can take any more. She also called the gourmet review guide and sent them a link to our new website and menu. And they've agreed to come back and re-review the restaurant, tonight. Tonight? Tonight. So, we have a lot of work to do, people. Let's get at it. Thank you. Don't scratch it. Good evening, Mister Martin. Welcome to Osteria. May we take your coat? I booked under the name of Stevens. We have a new system in place to keep track of all the best food critics in town. May I show you to your table? Thank you. Yes, please. Hank. Yeah? Guess what? What? He ordered the short ribs. Okay, here we go. All right, guys. Listen up. Um... As you know, the restaurant has been in a bit of a rut recently. Well, the last four years, actually. And that's on me. But from now on, we aim for the stars. Yes, we do. 100 percent. Last few weeks has taught me that I've, uh, well, I've been kind of taking you guys for granted and I have. But this isn't about me anymore, this is about us. I love you guys, you're family. And I just know that together, we're gonna kill it. So take your time, breathe, and execute. Tonight we introduce the world to the new Osteria. Yes, Chef! Let's get it done! Service. Okay. Alright her we go. Service. How long on that burrata? In 20 seconds, Chef. Thank you. I... I can't look. What's he doing? Smiling. Smiling? Mmhmm. Smiling how? Smiling like he's just eaten the best thing he's ever had in his life? Really? Really. You're not messing with me? Not even a pinch. Then how come you're so weirdly calm? Oh, that's just on the outside. Inside, I'm a mess. Yeah, me too. You know, you did risk everything for me. Yeah, you know? You kinda got me fired? I know, I did! Uh-huh. You know, I might be able to help you with that. Oh, really? Yeah, if you drop off a resume tomorrow, my new partner Miss Young, she might be able to help you out. Miss Young, huh? Mmhmm. It's Maggie. Always Maggie. ♪ You'll probably never love someone like I do ♪ ♪ You'll probably never love someone like I do ♪
