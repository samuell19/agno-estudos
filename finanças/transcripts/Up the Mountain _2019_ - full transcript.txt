STANDING ON THE MOUNTAIN STANDING ON THE MOUNTAIN Pierre is joining his parents. Martine and Jacques... Martine and Jacques. He's leaving his little brother Hugo, to whom he was so close. I remember them, as kids, their questions about God, whom they were so wary of. How not to be, when life took their parents, so brutally, one day to the next. Pierre was an original, he was often reproached for it. And many of you here today, visibly in pain, haven't always held him close to your heart. But Pierre didn't care what people thought of him. He lived as he wanted to, proud, calm, loyal to his principles. He lived like many of us would like to live. I remember his reaction to watching A Nightmare on Elm Street, which I showed in our cinema. He was still a child. Hugo, you weren't yet born. He came and saw me after the film and said: 'I don't want to meet Freddy, 'but do I really have to stop dreaming?' I encourage you to think about that. It's now time to say goodbye to Pierre. I hope he will be welcomed in the Lord's land. He deserves it. Good to see you again. Do you think we've changed? A bit, yes. Wait, it's been... 14 years, right? The first time I spoke to you? Of course I remember. We were six, in the schoolyard at recess. I was with you, Bérénice, remember? And how. You came to us and said... 'Do you want to be my friends? The others are jerks.' Exactly. You said 'OK', without looking at each other. How did Pierre die exactly? He'd been sick for a long time. With what? A heart defect, from birth. He didn't want anyone to know, that's why I never mentioned it. Tell me a bit about you. What's life in Paris like? Have you seen each other? Once or twice, coincidentally, that's it. Do you work, Stan? No, but I have projects, which are coming along. Tell him, now. Go on. Well... I've had a few problems. Five years ago, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia, paranoid schizophrenia. I'm following a treatment that means I'm often hospitalized. I was there until yesterday, but I had a sort of permission. Do you think I could stay here for a few days? Well...yes, of course. Well, I'm here until I sell the house, so... Thanks a lot. And you, Bérénice? I'm OK. Nothing special. You're a teacher in Bordeaux? I was. I just resigned. I'd had enough. I want to do things I like. For example? For example...writing. Writing? Writing what, a novel? No, stand-up. You, stand-up? Yeah. Sorry, that was rude. Have you started writing? Can you show us? Stan. What? No, I'd be happy to. See. I'll be back. I didn't choose the era I was born in, nor the family I grew up in. Let's speak about my family. My parents were farmers, a bad idea from the start, farming in France is a bit like... being a casual worker in North Korea. I made a note to change that, it's not, it's a bit... No, it's good, it's good. Their second bad idea was to die in a helicopter accident in Martinique, when I was eight. It was the first time they left the farm for a trip together, they won it by answering a stupid question on TV. My big brother brought me up, but he died too. We all have something particular with death, don't we? Well, me maybe more than others. For example, the other day, I saw a friend in the street. In front of the cemetery, I should have known. He offered to grab a drink, I accepted. I said: 'We weren't very close. 'We were just together one year. 'I actually hated you then'. He was beautiful, mysterious, I was covered in acne. He got all the most beautiful girls at school, while I masturbated to panties for three years. My parents never knew. Well, I was... an unlikeable sort. We had a drink, he asked me questions, he found it interesting. No, he didn't give a shit, he pretended to listen to me. At the end of my monologue, I asked him: 'And you?' He put his hand on my shoulder, and told me how he survived the attack in the Bataclan, and predicted the end of the world would happen soon. A strange sort. There. I've stopped there, but I... I have other things. Bravo, it's very promising. The idea was to do something... autobiographical. Autobiographies are good. There are three things... that I have to tell you. It's true. Ridiculous, show us. If you don't believe me, come. I found myself in the avenues of your heart. My soles were stuck, I was hitch-hiking. You asked me to get in, I got onto your behind. And there, I showed you the green light of my stroking. -There! -In-indi indicator, I felt your sweaty thighs... Are you OK? Your ass, your ass, your ass, at the end of your pussy, but always on all fours. To my beat, you slide like liquid. So take off your white underwear, and we'll... You're an asshole. One morning, Pierre called me. At the time, I was studying in Bordeaux, and he was studying medicine. He had a strange voice on the phone, so I asked him how he was, and he said: "I'm OK, "but I've decided to stop studying." I said: 'Really?' and he continued: "I'm going to take over the farm and make it organic." One month later, he moved here. And one month after, he gave up on his project. He had a new idea in the meantime, looking after old, sick animals. He started working with circuses, with zoos, he went to get animals, sometimes far away. I imagine these ones were in convalescence or abandoned. What will you do? Give them away. No, they'll die if you do. What would you do? I'd let them free. If you let them free, they'll die too. Yes, but at least in liberty. How far away is the summit? About four hours, if I remember well. How stupid was I to suggest this last night? You were drunk. Next time I'm drunk, don't listen to me. I wasn't very sincere with you yesterday, when you asked what I've become. It's not as rosy as that. What do you mean? My life has been pretty crappy for a while now. I accept an odd job until I've had enough, I find another one and it restarts. A bit like love, actually. It's pathologic. Do you have someone? Not at the moment. I thought of something, but it's hard to tell you, I'm a bit embarrassed. Shall we stop? Do you remember Baptiste? The mayor's son. I could never stand him. I can't stop thinking what my life would be if I spent it with him. She's serious. So it seems. Do you know what happened? You don't know? What? He participated in Molokai, three years ago. What's Molokai? A survival game, with physical challenges, you don't know it? -No. -Well, he won the show, he lived a bit like a prince for a year, until he completely lost it. The wave of success stopped, divorce, he went back to live with his dad with his daughter. He got custody. Apparently he had a judge who liked reality TV. And he lives with his dad? I could never stand him either. He really annoyed us when we were young. Like father, like son. I recognized him at the funeral, he seemed OK. Apparently he has Alzheimer's, thinks he's still the mayor. Pierre said the illness made him nearly nice. We're saved. Yes? Dimitri? Who are you? Hugo. Pierre's brother. Hugo...shit. You remember Stan and Bérénice? Shit, Stan, Bérénice. You guys have changed. What are you doing here? Well...I live here now. Can we... Ah yes, sorry, come in. Come and warm up. Watch your head. I thought you knew. He came and saw me about a month ago. He was sitting where you are, Hugo. Here. This morning, I got up and said: "It's been a while since I've had news from my best friend." So I found this bottle in my parents' cellar, and then you showed up. We spoke of everything and nothing. He told me about the village. And Anna, with her bar? Obviously, I asked him plenty of questions about Anna. Still working hard. After a while, I got up and read him a poem that I'd written the night before. "Now, she looked at me like a stranger." He listened to me in silence. I don't know if he liked it, but he had tears in his eyes. That was our last night together. Do you want to dance? What? Do you want to dance slowly? But...I don't have any music. It's still beautiful without music, right? OK. And for three minutes, we turned around each other, when...when he brought his mouth to my ear. I've only had one real love, then I had my brother, and then you. And he left, just like that. Stan... Stan. Wake up. Stan. Come on. Come with me. What do you want? I don't know. What? I don't know what I'm doing here. I thought you could tell me. I think, actually, that I have no identity, other than being a fabrication of your thoughts. It's not me who appears in the middle of the night. You must have something to tell me. Euh... To live better, help your friends live better. 'To live better, help your friends live better.' How do you want me to help them? I think the last time I felt joy, real joy, was when we were kids. When we ran around the village, summer nights, until the sun went down. Is it still possible to find this damn joy or is it lost forever? I have nothing in Paris. So stay here. Right? Stay with us. Hi, Hugo. Hi, Jean. We found the zebra. -But apparently there's also... -A llama. ...a llama, a strange animal, with bulging eyes, walking around the village. I left the grange door open inadvertently, sorry. I'll look after it. Thank you. Shit. It's over for you, Franck. Franck, you join Leïla. Only three left. This is when it happened. I had to stay still. The adventurers know this bamboo challenge well. Look at the others' faces. ...and in the end, maybe a defeat. There. Only two challengers left: Bruno and Baptiste. Do you know how dad did it? How? Thinking of his daughter. The last totem of your adventure. The winner... automatically qualifies for the final of Molokai. I thought about you. Are you getting it, grandpa? Amandine? Are you bringing the files? No, I'm not... Why did you leave the town hall? Sorry? What are you doing here? I...I came to see Baptiste. You came to see my son? Yeah. Baptiste. My secretary wants to see you. Yeah. What did he say? I think his secretary wants to see you. His secretary? Stan, Stan. How did he get in? I don't know. Shit, he's destroyed the vegetable garden. What do we do? Ring the bell and ask to get him. We go in, get him without saying anything, then leave. -Isn't that better? -Absolutely. Sorry about my dad. He's going completely mad. He confused you with his secretary who retired 15 years ago. I tried to reason with him at first, but it made him sad. Don't worry. I like coming here. It lets me release stress. Do you stress? Yes. Often. I guess in Paris, especially now, that you can't imagine being stressed in the country. Yes, I do. It's strange to be here talking with you after all these years. You were always with Stan and Hugo. I feel like we've never spoken seriously. You became...You're a real... A real woman. That's right. And you're still pretty handsome. I take care of myself. It's a bit hot. It's OK. Apparently you became a star? -Did you watch? -No. You didn't see me? I don't have a TV. TV is for idiots who want to be brainwashed. Hugo told me. You haven't changed. Against everything. I'm not against everything. I just demand certain things. What? At least I've done something with my life. Because being on TV is doing something? That's a bit simplistic. I made people dream. You made grannies frustrated by their old husbands dream, that's all. You don' get it. I would kill to have that again. To have another famous moment. Don't you think there are more important things? Once you've had that, the rest is boring, I swear. Take me back. What? I was that close to kissing you, maybe even offering to sleep with you on the lake, but you've managed to mess it up in record time. I feel like we'll never find it. Surely there's somewhere we haven't been. You know I went to see Baptiste? How was it? Sad. He spoke about his show, he didn't understand. I think deep down, he pitied me with his dreams. I wonder what would've happened if we'd stayed here too. It's hard to imagine. We'd have stayed friends right? Definitely. And instead, it's like we didn't exist for 14 years. We had our lives, independently, that's all. Didn't we still have things to do together? I'm going to bed. Where's Stan? He went outside. He asked me for some sports clothes, went for a run. Good night, Hugo. Good night. Sorry for bothering you. You're not bothering me, I'm getting new films for the program. Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the first sequel. Have you seen it? Terrifying. What can I do for you? I want to confess. I'm quickly falling under a guy's charm, and I... How can I put it? ...have an irresistible taste for sexual relations, which can make me lose control. When I meet a guy I like, I need to sleep with him, I can't help it. Because when I'm in a guy's arms, I feel like I exist. You know, when we're alone, when he puts his hand in my panties, when he strokes me, just before the act, it makes me shudder. And when he enters me, well... My God, I want to cry. But after a while, I let the relationship go. I want to be alone. So I make myself suffer. I feel melancholic. I've always had trouble leaving guys I was with. I'm afraid of hurting them. So I stay, I pretend, until they leave me. I let them do so, without resisting. But at the same time, I think I'm changing. What makes you say that? It's recent, but... I'm no longer obsessed with sex. That must be a sign of change. What's keeping you in the village, Bérénice ? I don't really know. It's strange, coming back here. You know, there are all these souvenirs. Are you happy to see your friends again? Yeah. I missed them. I didn't realize, but I really missed them. And how is it with your mother? We no longer talk. That's a shame. It's her fault. Why don't you go and see her? Do you think it's worth it? Maybe you have to start there? Maybe it will give you strength to make decisions. Are you ready? Nearly. Wait two seconds. Bérénice. Bérénice. Bérénice. Bérénice. So, you've decided to stay in the village a bit? Yeah, I'm staying with Hugo. -How is he? -I think he's OK. I saw the house was for sale. I don't know if he'll get much for it. I don't know who would want to live there. How is retirement? Not too boring? Are you interested now? Why are you so aggressive? I'm not aggressive. I asked a question. Are you interested in me? I can answer a question by asking another one. This is hopeless, we'll never get there. Whose fault is that? How many times will you reproach me for living with dad? At least I can speak to him. I stayed 16 years with you, it's something. Is it that bad? We could...try to make up for lost time. We could try to hug, to start. Come here, mom. Come in my arms. Do you have a cigarette? This is the last one. Here. You know we're both exceptional beings. Why is that? We're exceptional because... we suffer from the same disease. It's very rare. Sometimes, do you also have the impression your heart beats so slowly that this beat, which seems so far way, will be your last? How's it coming along? Meh. I'm lacking inspiration. I don't know if I'm really able to be funny. I think you should speak about things that make you happy. I need to tell you, my mother called. The hospital agreed to look the other way, but they've given me three days to return. I need to finish my treatment. According to them, I could be dangerous to myself and others. What will you do? What do you mean? I have to leave, otherwise, they'll come and get me. I booked a taxi to the train station. You know, my head is spinning. It's spinning bad. It was nice to be here with you. But it was never going to last forever. Take care. Thanks for having me. And... Think about what I said for your stand-up. Look after him, OK? And you too. I trust you. I would have liked to help you, but... I'm not abandoning you, you know. Do you mind if I stay longer? No, not at all. Sorry. I hope you vote. You have to vote. If you don't vote at your age, it's the end. The door open to all these extremists. Do you know how to explain such a violence today? Country of equality, yeah, sure. And Paris? Is it crazy? No? I'll confess something, I wake up nearly every morning telling myself that the world is nearing the end. It's true, there's no morning where I wake up in peace. But, well. I have a coffee, a big glass of organic orange juice, and head into the fight. Life is a fight, damnit. Life is a fight. Can't drop our guard. We need to prepare our kids for happier days, right? We need to act. Act and hope, otherwise... -Otherwise... -Stop here. How much is it? 16 euros. Here. Thanks. No, keep the change. Thanks, that's nice. You're right, we can't drop our guard. Where are you? Come on. -How are you? -Yes. I thought long and hard after our last meeting, and I can't take responsibility for your existence. Mine is already hard enough. So I've decided to let you go. What will I become? You can think for yourself. Don't lose hope, never. Hi, I'm going to the village. Get in. Are you getting in? I hate funerals. That's why I wasn't there. I understand. And I was never close to him. I always found him strange. A lot of us think he was ashamed of things. Serious things. We weren't very close either, us two. No. We didn't like each other much. I don't know why, we just didn't. What have you become? I've had a few health problems too. Are you cured? I don't know, but I decided that from now, I'll sort my problems out myself. My dad has problems. My grandpa has problems. Is it an obligation to be unhappy when old? No, it's not. You mustn't think that. -Hello, Stan. -Hello, Anna. You can't leave the village? Honestly, I tried, but something happened, and I'm back. -What would you like? -A coffee, please. Can I use your phone? I have no battery left. Yes. He's playing tonight. -If you want to come. -Why not. Let's check the voice. You've reached Nadia's phone, leave a message please. Hi, mom, it's me. I've changed my mind, I'm not coming back immediately. I'm better, and I have a lot of new projects that... I can't abandon now. I'm currently working on several creations of internet start-ups, including one about adopting children. It's a way of testing potential maternity or paternity without risks. I don't have much time to think about it, but I believe in it. And... I've found my friends and they need me. Mom, you absolutely need to sign a document so that I don't go back to the hospital. I know you can. You'll do it. It's the only thing I ask of you. I love you. Hi. Are you coming back? Well... Get out of my cafe. I want to speak to you. I have nothing to say. Go. Hey. -Are you chasing it? -Yeah. She said: 'It's not for everyone. 'Some have had it, some haven't.' So I'm wondering. Does that mean we can be born unequal with humor? I think that was the moment she started... And I saw her eyes which went like this towards the exit... Hugo. I was in the taxi. I listened to the driver tell me his life story. And he started making me feel guilty about mine. So I asked him to stop the taxi, I went into a forest. I spent the night there. Yeah? I solved some of my problems. But... I have... I have something to show you. Go on, show them. -Don't forget, a beer. -Yes, OK. And how are you? Anna, come here. Anna, please. Anna, I need to speak to you, it won't be long. When I found out Pierre died I decided to come down. I realized that the people I hold the most dearly could disappear without me knowing. You thought you could just barge in like this? After leaving me for... to live with yourself. Your speech was long. What did you want, that I jump into your arms? No, I didn't imagine that. But if I said I was still in love with you, and that I'm sure of it now, and that I was wrong to leave, would that change anything? You two seem close. What do you want, Baptiste? Last time we met, I thought you reproached me. Do you know that Hugo? No, you don't. I'll tell you. I don't want to know. Leave us alone, Baptiste. Are you threatening me? No, I'm not. I'm just asking you to leave us. Stop, Baptiste. Come on, let's go. Hugo, stay here. Follow me, Hugo. Are you coming? Yeah, I'm coming. Enough, Baptiste. Let him go. Stop, Baptiste. Baptiste, stop. Why are you looking at me like that? You never liked me anyway. What do you think of Baptiste? He's nice. Do you really think he's nice? Don't you find him a bit... pretentious? Like 'I understand everything about life and you're just naive'. We're not really much against him. Why do you say that? Hugo, let's be clear. Life hasn't really gifted us. Compared to him I mean. Isn't it a bit unfair? The planets aren't aligned. You think we're losers. That could be the right definition. I don't agree. Not at all. Ask Bérénice if she thinks we're as interesting as Baptiste. Bérénice is blind. Bérénice knows what she wants. She needs to understand we're her real friends, and she'll never have others like us. Never say that we're losers again. OK, Stan? Never say that again. We're better than that, OK? Who's the girl with your brother? I don't know, I've never seen her. She's beautiful. I have doubts about his sexual orientation. You just intimidate him. You're intimidating, Bérénice. Who's that? -Let's follow them. -Who? Your brother and his girlfriend. I didn't choose the era I was born in, nor the family I grew up in. Let's speak about my family. You're ready now. It's great. -Bérénice. -Yeah. I... I wanted to tell you something important. I'm sorry. I'll call you back. I didn't tell you everything, I left my life abruptly. When my mother told me about Pierre, I was with a guy. His name is Sofiane, we lived together in Normandy. He stopped calling me, I thought he understood, but he started again a few days ago. He's someone... He's fragile. And excessive. Long story short, he's threatening to commit suicide if I don't return. You really haven't spoken to her? I'm off then. Goodbye, you two. How can you not say anything? If you think she'll come back, you're wrong. That's not Bérénice. Bérénice. Wait. Don't get in. Don't go to the train station. We're coming with you. We'll take the van. Sofiane left Paris after the attacks. He'd had enough of being checked whenever he went out. Imagine how difficult it was. So I followed him. What did you do with yourselves? We worked in a bar. Otherwise, he played music. Every morning at dawn, rain, hail or shine, he got his keyboard and an amp, and composed above the cliff. Long pieces, quite cold wave. What a character. When he was on the phone, he said that if I didn't return by tomorrow morning, he'd jump. He's always had a taste for dramatic scenes. Do you think he's capable? I don't think so. But I'd feel guilty to not let him feel he had it in him. It's nice to see you together. I would never have thought it possible to start again. It's what I needed too. Falling back in love. Having someone. -You have your daughter. -Yeah. I don't know what I'd do without her. Speak of the devil... Grandpa has disappeared. What? I went to say goodnight, but he wasn't there. I looked all over the house but I didn't find him. Shit, Hugo, you were doing at least 150. Gentlemen. Madam. Do you know your speed? I don't know, 130? 132? 152. Told you. To be honest, officer, we're on a special mission. We'll see about that. What type of special mission? We work for the CRNS. No, the CRS... -CNRS. -The CNRS. We're expected urgently at the Rouen research center. Can I ask the nature of the emergency? Of course, but I'll ask you to keep it quiet. What is it? I just want to show you what is in my bag. Get out and open the trunk. Normally, it's more impressive, because it lights up, you understand. What should I understand? It's a meteorite. OK. We're going to test your blood alcohol. Did your grandfather behave strangely these last few days? Every day, he's lived in the past for 10 years. -So? -Nothing. What do you think? He would have left a note? Do you know where he is? What are you doing, dad? We spoke together and the images came back. With whom? With the strange beast. The strange beast? I remember that I was in love with a woman for two-thirds of my life. How could she have disappeared from my memory? It was here, under this tree, that I kissed your mother for the first time. Are you sure you want to do it? Esther. Esther. Esther. You better stay here. Your thoughts are escaping, you put your fingers in the socket. But there's no more electricity, the effectiveness of putting it in. But you, you live against the wind, it's time for a break. And you jump with. See, I came. You won't jump. Think who's left, your family, your friends. My family went back home. They don't care about me. I have no friends. Max, Léo, Jeanne... And your music? I have no more inspiration. I'm at the end. I'm going around in circles. It's horrible. I read on a blog that if you're not able to save someone from suicide in five minutes, it's gone. Bérénice left the van exactly eight minutes ago. And told us to stay here. If we have a chance to save him, it's now. We might be making a mistake. Who are they? My friends. Childhood friends. Stop or I jump. I understand the temptation, but suicide isn't the solution. Unless you believe in life after death, but between us, we're far from being certain. What's he talking about? Are you ready to come back? OK. Wait. What is it? I propose a pact. If this stone lights up, you should come back. If nothing happens, you can jump. OK. Stan. What? What did you do with the stone? It's not a stone, it's a meteorite. I didn't do anything. You just must never lose hope. That's the first time I've left a guy. Can we stop at the next one for a break? ST. VICTOR CLINIC PSYCHIATRIC CENTER Can I have your tights? What? I need your tights, I'll give them back. Here. Thanks. See you soon. The story of a guy who has never been at ease with his feelings. When he was six, he was already in love with a girl. But at the time, he didn't really realize, because love, he only knew the word, without knowing what it really was. So he looked at the girl, wondering what made his heart beat faster when he was next to her. When he was nine, he thought that... that love caused death. So he decided to stop trying to understand. After high school, the girl, the boy and his best friend went their own ways. So... For 14 years, the boy thought about the girl, without stopping other things from happening, but they were always bland and tasteless. Then one day, she came back. For him, it was... like a second chance. But the problem was... the boy still had little self-confidence. He didn't know how to say that he'd never felt something so strong. Stan. I'll come back to get you. -What? -I'll come back to get you. Who was that? How would I know? He had tights on his head. Stop. Hey! Stop. Stop him. Stop him. It's OK, it's OK. It's nice to be home. I'll take the meteorite back to the cabin. I'll come back and get you. Are you real or am I hallucinating? I'm a bit lost too. It's over now. I came to say goodbye. This time, definitively. Find a way to tell Hugo I love him. That I love him like a brother. Subtitling: Hiventy
