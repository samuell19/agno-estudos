What have you done? - Why? - I've been cleaning up all morning. Never mind. Give mum the hare or it'll never be ready for lunch. Not if I'll be skinning it! Have you seen the mess your daughter made? Yes. All her father. I can only hope I won't find some rabbit's offal under the sofa. - It's a hare! - Keep calm, honey. I would have never invited him. Please, you've been asking me to meet him for the past three years. My wonderful women. Nervous? If you stain me, I won't have time to change. You should get changed instead. You have to go and pick up the guests. I can't. I had to send that one. - Mao! - Bao! - Mao! - Bao! Mao, idiot. Hello. You must be those whom I've come for! Ludovico, Diana's brother! - Pleased to meet you. - Likewise. - Nice shirt! - Thank you. Let's go! Welcome to Villa Liviatani! How long have you two been dating? Do you reckon it's appropriate? Almost three years. Diana, you've never made a guy last this long! You wanted him here. Not even a bit of alcohol. It reminds me of middle school. I shouldn't have brought you. - What? I brought you here! - Why? Are you afraid of my family? Well, if I knew your brother was a Nazi… Ludovico? Nazi? He doesn't even know what it means! He got passionate while exploring little markets in France. France? Nice. What does he do there? He is a head-hunter. And what job do you do? Don't bullshit! Are you trusted? I am a private detective! Pardon us for the frugality of the lunch. Unfortunately, we have a business to attend at the foundation. - Undelayable, and I apologize. - Learn to cook. It's all very good. Congrats. Honey. Maybe we should raise the heat. Our friend there is cold. - I'm good. - The hat. Diana speaks fondly of your noble initiative. I am happy you agree with us. You see, helping others gives you the chance… to be closer with the Universe. You are a philosopher, right? Yes. I shouldn't be the one telling you certain things. Well, I studied philosophy - but then life, things perhaps had me… - Nonsense! A philosopher is always a philosopher, until he prostitutes himself. With all due respect to prostitutes, obviously. With all due respect. The fact he is a philosopher is only one of the many characteristics of Orlando. - Were you aware? - Really? Yes, because Orlando is a true artist. In the kitchen! Ludovico, didn't you like the hare? I thought I skinned it so well this time. It must be all those protein shakes making him so… tense. - How do you handle meat? - Well… - to be honest… - Rare. - Yes. Rare. - Good! Honey. These friends of ours must come to the party! Of course. They'll be our main dish. Mum, the vegetables. Of course, darling. If you'll excuse me. You are too tense, darling. Orlando seems like the perfect match. He keeps your standards high and your father fancies him. If it wouldn't be so absurd, he could even ask for your hand. I wouldn't exclude it. What a perfect reason for him to be here. Nowadays, relationships last less than a tank of my paint. Can you hear your father? - Doesn't he remind you of someone? - Who? Silvio. You could pick up where you left off with him. It's different. Silvio broke up with me. That's the point! No one can break up with a Liviatani. Do you write? You should write. I allow myself to suggest a topic. The moral decay, particularly in women. They are undermining the base of our society. Family! What does that one do for a living? Well, I wouldn't want to bore you talking about me… He's a private detective! You had to tell my sister you're a private detective? She is a kid! She believes everything you say. You were there too! You were part of the joke. Private detective. You? On the second day you'd get backstabbed! Private detective, porn actor, spaceman… I mean, it's a joke! - There's joke and joke! - Joke and joke… Tell her! How many times have we done these things together? Come on Diana, you too… Anyway, there are different jokes! Well, it's Biagio… Was it here you hung out in high school? Just a second. What does it mean there are different jokes? How many jokes should there be? It's not like I can tell you. Use your head. Use your head. I was sure I'd find you here. I'm sure you understood my family isn't open-minded. I believe my debut went beyond my best expectations. Your expectations are pretty low, my love. What do you mean? A glass of wine isn't enough to know Mr. Liviatani. Yes? And how many glasses of wine has that guy drunk with Mr. Liviatani? Silvio? He's just an old schoolmate. Come on, won't you tell me you never had a flirt with one of your schoolmates? That's not really true. Anyway, the way you say "flirt" is hilarious! - Then you admit it! - What? That you talk like an old man? No, that you had some liaisons in high school. Some boyfriends? - Some friends with benefits? - These are the things I hate about you! We've been dating for three years. I brought you here to meet my parents and what do you do? You become all weird when you meet one of my old schoolmates! You've never told me anything about your life here… And you're surprised? Every time we start a serious conversation here comes your friend and that's it. Go to your room. My parents are back. If they catch you here, you're dead. Do you really think that yellow… What's his name? Biagio. Do you think he is a detective? No, I don't think so. In my opinion, he makes things up. Just like you over lunch. And now the dilemma. How the fuck do I get in? - Is everything good? - These crepes are going to be amazing. Good morning, sister number one. Saturated fats. Play this. But I don't know how to play. Are you sure? Shame. Let's see how many more noises you come up with to avoid this argument. Very mature. - Congratulations. - Sorry, I am not as original as you. You wouldn't want your daddy to find you in the same room as your boyfriend. Good job, Orlando! It's wonderful! Honey. Do you know who I ran into? Silvio. Do you remember Silvio? Yes, she remembers Silvio. Excuse me… It was clear you had no clue on how to play the piano. I don't play the piano, anymore. But I used to… before… I used to play with a singer. We were in love. She was a beautiful woman who got killed in a cold night. Since then I ended my relationship with music. - Amazing! - Amazing? How? It's amazing you are no longer a musician but a private detective. Did you hear that? I am so lucky. If you're happy… Thank you, my darling. I met a very interesting woman. For the foundation? No, dear. For you. You are so sweet. We should invite her to the party. We'll see. I should meet her first. Get to know her opinions, her tastes. Start clearing up your diary then. That diary is a slaughter. Well, that means I taught you some good manners. Do you remember how I was? Of course, I remember. - My mother wanted you dead. - What a saint! Amazing color, my love. Amazing you. Thank you. What are you looking at? It's the Nazi brother. - He's not a Nazi. He's a collector. - No, he's a Nazi and he scares me. He's not a collector. I'm telling you. - What the fuck are you doing? - I'm smoking. Give me that! Can you stop being the Biagio of the situation? But I am the Biagio of the situation. A little smoke. What could it do? We can't do whatever we want. This is not our house. We are guests. Diana made me notice… Ah, Diana made you notice! She doesn't like me. I get it but you are not putting any effort. Help me out, both of you. What? What's going on? Why are you so worried? - Let it go, it's private. - You see? Private. Well, it's about you too. You are the weird friend. And you're the weird friend of the weird friend. Got it? I will never understand this. It's so uncomfortable, inelegant. You've finally made a decision. So it seems. Perfect. I'll take good care of Orlando then. Hello. I did not see you there when I walked in. Excuse me. You know, you're the first boyfriend my daughter brings home. Oh, really? I wanted to ask you some questions and get to know you better. - Yes. Of course. - Don't be nervous. - I'm not nervous. - But of course, you are. You immediately gave me the impression of having… such a weak personality. There's no need to be ashamed of it. The world is full of faintheartedness. Maybe that's why you chose philosophy as a degree. To be honest, I chose philosophy because I care about our nature… Orlando… You chose philosophy because you did not want to face more serious matters. Such as engineering, medicine, economy. But life is beautiful even because of all these varieties, even the most insignificant. - Mum. - My dear. I've finished my records. Mum, can I go out with Biagio? He said he's going to buy me an ice-cream. The records, mum. The records. I understood. It's just… you and I know. Darts? You know, I'm always on my own. They're all always busy and no one ever brings me out. I'm so happy mum allowed me to come with you. How lucky. School, dance, home, homework. Then church on Sunday. And then again: school, dance, home… How can I become an adult if I keep doing the same things all the time? - Isn't that Diana? - Yes. That's Diana. And that is Silvio. - I think it's time to head home. - Shall we say hi? If you like people to see you with a 12-year-old girl… Yes, you're right. Let's go home. So, not even the Liviatani family is perfect. You have your flaws too. More than you think… Morelli. I had no doubts. This was what I didn't like. This aristocratic hypocrisy. Move a second. Yes. I have a surprise for you. After all this time? I've waited long enough! It might be heavy, but it's satisfying! Oi! LIVING IN HARMONY Can we talk? Talk, like we look at each other? Without that book between us? "We are worthy?" What the fuck are you reading? - The usual superficial. - It's not Nietzsche. Nietzsche? You don't even know who he is. - Listen Orlando, we must talk! - Just one thing. Do you think it's appropriate to leave me here on my own? - Good job, you both! - Dafne? - Diana. - Diana. You hanging around somewhere while I was here alone with the Nazi. Not Nazi. Collector. Whatever he is. - Four hours we've been playing darts. - Let the retard be. I was with Dafne, okay? And we saw Diana. And guess who I saw Diana with? Now you are listening. Biagio! These had to be with the cold food. How many times do I have to tell you? La brigade de cuisine. Biagio, did you remember the wine my dad recommended? He really cares about it! I am so sorry… You have a lovely smell. The winery is cooking… I mean, the wine is in the kitchen. When it's ready… When you want it… Is brigade always this formal? Only when he's caught doing very stupid things. Brigade! If we were in the Middle Age, I'd leave my handkerchief on the floor so you could pick it up and smell it whenever you wished. Where have you been? It's over! - What? - It's for your own sake. It's enough. - Without knocking? - You're out of your mind. Can you explain to me what the fuck it's happening? I'll tell you, but you won't like it. Because this situation is fantastic right now… Seeing you here with my family, in my world, made me understand how inadequate you are! Cool. I'll pack then and Biagio and I are out of here. Okay? Don't bullshit! You have to stay here at least until the party. - You heard my father. - But why? You see? You have no idea on how to behave properly in society! Come in. - I just wanted… - Close the door. Make yourself at home. You fit just perfectly! When I beat three times with this… you turn the record player on. Everything clear? - I just wanted… - Yes. Shut up! - Does he know? - To be honest, it's him that… Smile! If I win, you tell me everything that's happening. We could talk like normal adults… Maybe you're afraid of me? I just wanted to avoid your umpteenth humiliation, but if you insist… You have a peculiar way of worrying about him. At least I do worry. You are the weirdest between us since you invited me here and you can't stand me! You came of your own will. And thank God. Look what I've found out! - You and that Silvio. - Here's the private detective. Satisfied? I've always said that in politics personality matters more than intelligence. And you, weird friend, have neither. Let's go! You can't! Parent "Y" is calling you. He doesn't let me do certain things. Come on. Calm. Breathe! Calm down. In waking a tiger, use a long stick. Mao Tse Tung. You are different though. Maybe I have something for you. Maybe. Come on in! What do you think? Years and years of study, devotion, effort… to reach the sublime. No one comes in here. Not even my son. Particularly my son. Are these copies or… All originals. Maybe not first editions, but you know how hard it can be finding a first copy of the Divine Comedy. But the Don Quixote, yes! And it's not the only one. What about this one? The Liviatanis during the centuries. It must be a perfect behavior manual. Your family is so sophisticated. Sophistication is an art you learn. I know something about it. What matters is the teacher. Maybe that's where I'm lacking. Maybe your time has come. I would like to be good enough for you. I have never asked but maybe one day I would like to be worthy of your daughter's hand. We must start the apprenticeship then. You're quite late. - Can I have my shirt back? Do whatever you want, don't bother me! I'd say fruity. Fruity. And persistent. - Found it! - Persistent on the palate. The exact opposite. What is it? Another "self-esteem" book to get your girlfriend back? - Or self-erotism? - Are you three or what? - That's enough with these methods, eh! - Go play with the kid, go! I'm going. What's happening, boy? Well… it's hard to explain. Try. I have this friend, Orlando. We are like Achille and Pericle. Patroclo. Well, those two… the gays of the Trojan war. And then there's this one, Diana. She is involved with my friend. - Achille. - No, Orlando. Well, I introduced her to him, do you understand? And to think… think what a jerk I am! I also think she broke up with him. And how do you know that? Because my friend takes it out on me to get her back! Easy, no? See? This is her and this is him. How come she is with him? He is a penniless. She clearly comes from a noble family. That's what I have told him when I saw her for the first time! The exact same thing! And her father has that same car. No, that's his car! This is the moral decay that is threatening our society's principles. I can't look! Jesus Christ! MARCH TO DEFEND THE TRADITIONAL FAMILY Honey. I did it, yes. Are you going to be done in 35 minutes? I don't know how long it's going to take. Let's say 40. - I love you. - Me too. I'm sorry. An urgent message from my husband. You were saying? I am here, in the most total secrecy. An important person such as I is always perceived to have a double end when it comes to support nobles' initiatives like yours. You are right. The business world is so tough that some people might think, and make us notice, that you want to clean your conscience through a poor donation. I beg your pardon, maybe you haven't really understood how much I intend to donate. Oh no, I haven't forgotten. Fifty thousand euros. Is it a significant amount, for a man of your stature? Is something wrong? I didn't want. No, it's not you. It's this liquor. It's not the liquor. It's potassium cyanide. What an idiot! Biagio would have immediately understood that the glass was poisoned. You can't trust that family, not at all! I have always stated that. Always! That one makes all those big speeches and then goes around looking for whores. The brother is half retarded, Nazi. And the youngest… you can see she's not well, that something doesn't quite work! She looks at you with those eyes. And then Orlando's still going after the other one that runs away with… with this one! Jesus Christ! MISSING Hi. Do you need something? New paint? - You had fun last night! - And not just me. Ask your mother. Do you have a pill? - I have a terrible headache! - It must be all those cheap drinks you keep consuming! Anyway, I don't have anything. Okay. Then I'll stay in bed all day! In order to look even more depraved in front of the Liviatanis? I'll check if they have something. Good idea. This is not how paint flecks get old? Mum told me you are no longer attending dance classes? And she told me: "What do you care? Ludovico is always in Paris." Mum! Mum! Not now. Mum! This dickhead of a Nazi. Were you calling for this? IN CASE OF EMERGENCY - Rare? - Particularly rare. Can I break them? Those were bought to be broken. Good. Very Good. Where are you doing this show? - What show, let's go. - What are you saying? I'm doing a dance show tomorrow. And you're coming as well. Quoque you, first sister. Why can't I come? Because mum says that in these situations you get all anxious and can't stay calm. You are surely not as elegant and strict as Diana. In truth dear second sister, tomorrow I'll see you dancing! If you'll excuse me. - Ah, Orlando is not here. - And you. You are weird! I was looking for you. You really are desperate then. What's happening? Are you sure you're just friends with this Orlando? Yes. I need an expert. And you seem to know loads of things. Do you think a very special red paint can become of this color after a while? It's not special! It's 0 positive, the most common blood type. Listen up… you can tell me now. It's been a long time, and I won't get mad. Whose son is that? Not yours. Thank you. A load off my mind. Diana is your daughter, though! That's why you are always so worried when she has a new boyfriend. Yes. What is going to happen if she doesn't kill that one? He will survive. Just like I did. Biagio? I no longer know what to think, my dear Dafne. These behaviors of him make me think I should choose more wisely the people I spend my time with. Elbows. - Darling, you forgot the wine. - Golly. Do you want to pick it? I'd suggest a Saint Emilion Grand Cru Le Petit Cheval of 2002. I agree. If I find out they took Biagio away from me, I'll take it out on Orlando! It all relies on your sister, honey. Should we follow him? Nah, he's all about broken records and old junk. He seems the worst but he's harmless! I'll take care of the family, don't forget about tomorrow! Who let you in? How much did this one want to donate? Only 20,000! A bit low for your standard. I hope this is going to be a lesson to you. If you have a goal you must reach it. Even if your victims seem to be insignificant, they are always victims! It's all about good manners. A matter your father and I have always taught you. It's easy for you. You are cold in everything you do. Strangers… - aristocratic methods… - It hasn't always been like this. When I was younger, I was more like you than you think. - And dad? - Then your father arrived. He understood me and knew what to do to keep me. One day it will happen to you too. - Maybe. - Yes. As boring as your victims. Diana, did you really have to bring the bag in the car now? Do you reckon it is a good idea leaving your party just before the cake? I was afraid I would've forgotten it. I got it, but what the hell is inside this bag? Just my fitness outfit. It's not that heavy, my love. Maybe you drank a bit too much. - Maybe… - Look here. Don't you want to take this? Later. Perfect timing, mum. Why? I was just breaking up with Matteo. Mum, the stomach makes splotch. That was the cranium. No, no one saw me. - Cake! - Don't worry, I won't be alone. I met this guy. His name is Orlando. So, what are you going to do? It's not the time. - Allow me to say you don't look confident. - Don't worry about this. Then you should start looking around. Look at that guy, he has really tidy hair. And he is well dressed. There's a Mercedes parked just outside, it's his. What does your friend there have? A scooter? The bus pass. You have a tuxedo, right? What do you mean by tuxedo? THE PALETTE Jesus Christ! Good choice! Come, help me out! How the fuck does this open? - This wasn't the deal. - Was this in the deal? You asked for a big car. Listen up, you drive. I'm dead tired. Darling. I wouldn't be so worried about our daughter. She is pretty normal. I'd worry about that other one. If you had brought me a truck, as agreed, I could park in front of the house. But no! Have you ever seen a delivery man with a hearse? Delivery from the other side. Sleep. Hello! RIP Delivery! Can I come in? Thank you. Is this Silvio's house? You must be the wife or his partner. - Yes, it's me. - Hello. Your partner, husband, well, Silvio. He won this amazing television. May I talk to him? Please, don't… I understand you're happy but it's just a television. If he's not home, I can come some other day. There really is no problem. Haven't you seen the leaflets all over town? Silvio hasn't been home in two days! He disappeared. No one knows where he is. Not even that Liviatani he had to meet. Where are you going? - Nowhere. - You can give it to me. Don't worry. It's like I never came by. Jesus Christ! Why are private detectives not a good match? You don't know the troubles with picking detectives. I'm 12. If I don't choose now, I'll never have my victims! Diana already knew what she wanted at my age. Yes. But Diana has her own method. Have you seen the victims she picks? Passive and spineless. Yes, but I don't like spineless! Anyway, private detectives are not a good match. There's not even the time to take out the knife that they already have a gun. - What about Chinese? - Chinese. What if I meet one that knows the kung-fu? Writers? They're always behind a desk, doughy bodies, lost gaze… Hemingway, no. Then I'll have to fight for them with Ludovico! Okay, darling, then look around. The world is full of useless people. I want him! Haven't you understood that if mum doesn't agree, you can't do anything? Take a break! - Dad? - Yes? Not a word? Actually, no one has ever thought about private detectives. But Biagio isn't a private detective. You don't understand. Why are we here? To act like two lovebirds? - If you need a replacement… - I'd replace you. If I didn't know you better, I'd say you're responsible for Silvio's disappearance. And what's behind this delightful discovery, detective? Yeah, take the piss… it's useless. I'm talking about this. - So what? One less problem. - You might haven't understood. It happened the same night I saw him with Diana. And why haven't you gone to the police? Worried they'd take the license away from you? Stop it with this bullshit! - I'm serious. - Me too. - Good! - Do you think she's involved? Sue her. Do you know why you are not doing it? Because you are the usual shitty wimp that hides behind me. Wimp? Oh, come on! Do you really think the police are going to listen to me against the Liviatanis? Have you not understood who they are? They are the usual rich people that make you feel part of their world when it's clear to them that those like me and like you are at the bottom of society! They are at the top of the food chain. They incorporate you and suddenly you start talking, acting, and thinking like them. They are social serial killers! I liked the junkie Biagio better than the philosopher one! Do you know what the junkie Biagio is going to do? He leaves you in deep shit here! Here with your rare books, your dance shows, the old records and that one that has even broken up with you, loser! Bravo! Run, as you know how, asshole! Still doing these dramatic scenes? I'm not your father, got it? - What the fuck, dickhead. - Fuck off. Have you finally decided to take your friend out? Tell me the truth. Were you afraid I'd steal him away from you? And further increase the difference between your victims and mine. But I care more about quality than quantity. And just to be clear… Did you know Silvio has disappeared? - What happened to you? - Let it go. Answer me! Not now. You are bleeding. - You need to be taken care of. - Didn't you leave mercy out of here? Stop acting like a Liviatani! I'd like to see the real Orlando. - The old one. - I don't know who you are. I don't know the real Diana. You are killing me! With this kiss, you kill me. It's a locomotive. Do you know what I've always thought? That in '95 there was so much pornographic content… that the world's seven owners thought to create a place, even if virtual, to gather all this pornography together. They hid this operation behind communication media. And there you had the internet. The real weird thing is… that to me… you artists… I hate you all. Every time I hear the word "art", I just want to cut my hand on my razor. Cool life, eh? Need any help? Can't you see I'm becoming a stone? Your friend, I don't think he's okay. He says he's becoming a stone. He's the coolest. I'm trying to become Jimi Hendrix. Maybe with a bit of practice… I use this. Let me know. Look what a beautiful job I've done. I skinned my dear Biagio as a masterpiece! I'd say the first taste goes to his best friend. Thank you. And you were complaining. Look what a majestic dinner they've organized for you. To cook you, Orlando used up all his talent. Pearls to pigs. Everything's alright, mate? Mate, wake up! Hey, on your feet. I have got what you need. Drink this. - Oh my God! What is it? - What's that? One-third of vodka, two of water, and three spoons of cologne. The best hangover cure I've ever invented. And it makes your breath smell too. It was my workhorse when I was at Harry's bar. Have you worked at Harry's bar? That's another story. Where are we? It is not important where you are, but where you are going. It's him. Jesus Christ, he stinks! How did you find him? This is Julio's chair. He always comes here to think. I came to see if he thought of something new and I found him instead. So, he was dead. Yeah. We don't need to ask Julio who killed him. A present for you… parent Y. Twenty-five years old. Blonde. An art… prostitute. She's perfect. Thank you. Damn… Who did this to you? Where is Orlando? Not here. I was engaged in a very delicate family situation before you interrupted me. I am sorry. - Impoliteness is not accepted, here. - I see, but I must talk with Orlando. It seems as if the world's impoliteness has reached even my lair. Do you like it? It's beautiful. It's all yours. You are wonderful. But I am still a Liviatani. Tell me I'm crazy but I'm starting to like Orlando. I'd say he's the perfect match for our daughter. Don't be silly. Her career doesn't allow her to have a man. At least not now. Shame. He put so much effort to be worthy of her love. He chose a difficult role model to reach. I must go. Senator… nice to see you again. Mrs. Ermanno. It's the first time I see so many people in your house. For sure. - The other times have been more… - More? Intimate. I am happy you came. My wife as well. She's adorable tonight. So are you. The investments in art can be profitable and motivating. - Particularly during this period. - Look, with art, we mean it in the purest, wholly way, in the social meaning of caring for a painful soul. Tortured soul… True. Don't you reckon that 10,000 euros for your project is a good cure? - But in this way our art… - Yes! It can be a good cure. It is a good cure. You know who to call. I'll do it today. What? Tell my parents we broke up. And that I let you go. What? The other night… A false step. Trust me, is so much better this way. Better today. What about all I've done for you? For me or for you? Don't tell me you didn't like playing the Liviatani. I am not playing. I know I want to be with you. And if I want to be with you, I must be this person. You haven't dug deep enough then. A good choice in wine or a perfect tie is not enough. - And what should I do? - Pack. And leave. Now? So hesitant, honey. The party's just about to get started. What the fuck are you doing here? In a 12-years-old room? You're an idiot! Orlando, thank God you are here! We must leave! They are crazy! Killers! They are serial killers! You have to listen to me! Ludovico gave me to Dafne who thinks I'm a detective and she wants to kill me. I saw Silvio, he's dead! He was in a park, dead! Diana killed him, I'm sure of it! There's no time for you to look at me like that. Take me away please. I'll do whatever you want. No, what? It's not possible. Crazy? Killers? Who? This is what Diana wanted to tell me. This was what I had to understand. This is what she meant by dig deeper. - Shit, I should have known. - What? - They are an exceptional family. - What the fuck are you saying? Nice yellow. They are socially vanguard. All this time I've been looking for the right expression! They overpassed the historical materialism! There is no longer a difference between who produces… Their existentialism is pure. The only difference is between who lives and who dies. It's between who dies and who kills! Out of all the charitable activities, the best is still socialization. Don't you think? - What makes you think that? - The fact that you are a whore! No, don't be offended. You see, I am an expert when it comes to whores. I've killed so many. My God, Ermanno! Where is the director? Run! - Run. - Stop! Run! My love, what a nostalgia! Yes! Now I understand. I must be like them! Orlando, you are scaring me. Enough with this bullshit. And who would your victims be? Your annoying friends? - Why are you looking at me like that? - Sometimes you really have amazing ideas. - Where the fuck are you going? - I'm serious. Where are you going? I want to be just like you. Show me how it's done. This is what I use. Didn't you want to see how I use it? Didn't you want to see how it's done? Damn you all! He is mine! What the fuck are you doing there? Kiss me! There's a new Liviatani. Welcome to the family. And there I was, hoping until the very end… All's well that ends well. Jesus Christ! You are the only one left. For the last time… I am not a detective. This is not true. You are the only one who figured it all out. Now run, clever boy! Please… Run!
