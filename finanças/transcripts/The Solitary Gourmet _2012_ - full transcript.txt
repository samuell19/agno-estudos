Akabane, Kita Ward Akabane... I think it's been 20 years or so since I was here last. Looks so different... Little bit like Urashima Taro* feeling... (*Tale of a man who went missing and came back after 300 years) So this town had changed to this type of feel? [Go! Go! Akabane Joshi!] BaneJo*... (*short for Akabane Joshi/Akabane Female) BaneJo...huh...? Starring: MATSUSHIGE Yutaka [Um... what should I eat?] Regardless of time or society... [Um... what should I eat?] When someone indulges in satisfying his hunger... ["Welcome." "I'm going to eat in large serving"] ...he will become selfish and... [Ho~... My stomach is totally empty.] ...he will become selfish and... [Yes. This is really good meat.] ...liberated for a moment. [Yes. This is really good meat.] Without being disturbed by anyone... [Yes. This is really good meat.] ...to eat freely is an act of aloofness. [Yes! This is it!] ...to eat freely is an act of aloofness. [Hope the rice will come soon.... For Yakiniku, you must have white rice with it.] This act is the best comfort given equally to every man. ["Nom nom nom"... I'm really a Japanese who can't drink....] This act is the best comfort given equally to every man. [Nom nom... Pfff...] This act is the best comfort given equally to every man. [Phew... that was good. I feel like my stomach will burst. I ate too much.] EarthBuriTeam Subs Presents: ~KODOKU NO GURUME~ "The Solitary Gourmet" =Season 3= Ep. 1: "Guinea Fowl and Eel Bowl of Akabane, Kita Ward" So this is the place...

(*A Goetic demon) - Amon will breathe out fire from his mouth. - Oh, I see... - Do you understand? The feeling? - Yes. I do. Um...let me go over this. Um...Two Pazuzu and... Eh~ One each of Baphomet and Amon. No specific high request but would like to be in the form of wooden statues, is that right? Yes correct. Then, I'll contact you as soon as I get the information. I'm counting on you. Oh no. I'll take care of that. I can't allow customer to pay for it. And I'm planning to stay here for a little longer. Oh, I see... Then, if you insist. Ah! Akuma. I'm counting on you. Thank you for coming. Takiyama~! Next time I see you... ...you owe me a dinner for this. I can't win... I haven't even had breakfast yet so...

Oh, I see. Then, if you'll excuse me. Please take care of it. Once you leave the market street... ...this town shows a totally different face... How tasteful... A reason I feel attached to this kind of town is... ..maybe because every place in front of the train station... ...keeps changing so much... What is that...? That chimney... Municipally-owned apartments... [Municipally-owned Kamiya 3 cho-me #2 Apartment] Reminds me of Showa era... Huh? Did I go too far? Anyway, this thing is so heavy... I really wonder what's in it... This is it... [Karaoke Snack Takekurabe] I end up walking so much... This thing... I didn't have to use it... - Excuse me, is Minaki-san... - It's me. - Inogashira-san? - Oh, yes. I'm sorry to make you come in this hot weather. Come here and sit down. - Mama, get him a beer. - Yes. Oh, please don't worry. I can't take alcohol. - Eh!? - For real? Really, that's too bad. - Well, you're in the middle of business anyway. - That's true. - You two just drink too much. - Well~ haha... - Here is orange juice for you. And some peanuts. - Oh, thank you. Ah! Here, from your daughter. Oh, I'm sorry about that. Here it is. Year books. From middle school and high school. Oh, I want to see it! Eh~!? That's why it was so heavy... Oh oh, here here... That's Masao from photo studio. And this is me. Eh~!? Masao-kun has changed too but... Minaki-kun... You've changed beyond recognition. I was cute back then. Where? You really changed... - Where is Higashi-san? - Me, I'm here. Eh!? You were that handsome? And look at you now... Excuse me... This is what you've ordered. Oh, sorry to bother you. And, since I'm already bothering you... Can you... take this back home? That's too much. Take it back yourself! Ah.. yes. I will. She's so scary! I'm not scary. Thank you for your business. Work is done. Maybe because I walked so much... Feels like I'm getting hungry... Fruit sandwich... ...doesn't stay in the stomach too long... I want to... ...eat something... That's right... The shop I went to a long time ago, I wonder if they're still in business... I think... ...it was around here somewhere... That's right. It's right there. Still in business. (For business meetings and family dining, Marumasu house known for carp and eel) Just as I remembered...

Good looking eel... It's eel...Good looking eel... It's a little early for "day of the ox in midsummer" but... My body is desiring eel right now... (In many areas in Japan, it's a custom to eat eel on that day) And... ...this aroma... - Welcome. - Welcome! - Welcome. - Welcome. This aroma of eel, I haven't smelled for a while... ...my stomach is dancing in joy. I finally made it... Once you've decided, please call me. Guinea fowl...? I think I heard it in some French cuisine... Never thought... ...I'll see it in eel shop... They make sashimi and lightly roasted of it, too? Fatty...? They have so many varieties... Not good. I was getting lost in Guinea fowl... Let's concentrate on Eel... There it is. Then... ...let's have little Guinea fowl and close it with eel. Eel omelet... Fine. - Excuse me. - Yes. Have you decided? I'll take Guinea fowl variety dish and... One each of Guinea fowl variety stick and fatty stick... And...Eel omelet please. Thank you for your order. Eel omelet takes a little long. Is that okay? Sure. Ah! May I have Guinea fowl soup, too? Yes. Thank you. Did I... ...order too many Guinea fowl dishes...? - Three orders of Eel rice boxes upstairs. - Got it! - These are to be washed. - Got it.

[Guinea fowl soup] "Soup rich in Guinea fowl flavor have a kick of pepper too" This one will make you shout out for joy. - Welcome! - Welcome! - Welcome. Here is your eel omelet. Oh, let me take some of those empty plates. [Eel Omelet] "Fluffy outside creamy inside! Superb collaboration of eel and eggs" What a beautiful view... Almost a shame to eat it up... Eel in the middle of creamy eggs... So this is how it tastes... Sweet and creamy... Feels like eating western cuisine in the eel shop... Even in the middle of the eggs... ...eel is still an eel... Although it's collaborating... ...still not losing its pride. Good... It's time for the main dish... Eel bowl... - Excuse me! - Excuse me... Just a moment. - Have you decided? - Yes.

Eel and white rice... The best combination. Best combination to the stomach express line... For some reason, eel shops always... ...serve Nara-zuke... Since I can't take alcohol... ...I'm not a fan of narazuke... Oh... But this one is good... Tastes really good. But... It may make me feel a little drunk... It's really good. I'm getting full and still tastes great. It's almost overshadowing the guinea fowl... Eel bowl is doing a great fight. This profound taste... ...you can't master it overnight. I just ate the history. That was great~! - Thank you for coming! - Thank you! Woah... Huh? Did I get drunk with just narazuke? Big guy like me to get drunk with narazuke... ...I'll be laughed at... Thank you!

[Original writer, Qusumi Masayuki] It's hard to choose but I really want to try this Guinea fowl... These eel selections...The special, the choicest and... special choicest? The special choicest...?

[250 yen each] Variety stick has meat from 7 different parts of the bird. [Breast, midriff, neck, gizzard, skin, liver, wing] First, he will take a bite of fatty meat stick. It's good. It's fatty meat but not oily at all. It's like melts in your mouth. Then the variety stick... This is really good. It has a more refreshing taste than chicken. I can really go for more. Makes me drink more too. Let's see the Shinobi box Qusumi-san ordered. There is eel hidden under the rice as well as on top. Very luxurious item. Looks great. This is Shinobi? [Shinobi box regular 3100 yen] So it's called shinobi because...ah... There it is... It's hidden!! Two layered like this is usually with seaweed... How is the Shinobi box? So good... You can eat all in different ways... Like eat the top layer first and then eat second layer... Makes me smile... Eel box will makes you smile.
