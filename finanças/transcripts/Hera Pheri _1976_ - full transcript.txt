That means he has found us. Possible, that his entry in the casino was just.. A coincidence? No, Sherry, do you remember that night of Lucknow? I'm sure he has reached till here on the basis of.. That photograph. Never mind, PK. We'll kill him too. No, Sherry! We must reach to his mother.. To whom, Dinanath had said everything about me. And god knows where Vijay has hidden her. She's unconscious from the morning. - Did you give her the new medicine? - Yes. But it's useless. She become conscious for a moment.. And starts with the same old days. She asks, where's sir? Did you return from the college or not? And where am I? A year has passed, Shanti. We left Lucknow and came to Mumbai. But, mummy didn't come out of her shock. Even the medicines are not reacting. Medicine will react when she'll be sick. This is a terror that has stuck in her mind. Sir, can't you bring an expert doctor here? You very well know that I can't bring anybody here. But..There's no treatment of her sickness? There's one, Shanti. But I can't find him. And if I'll find him someday.. I'll. "God, I'm sailing with the faith in you."

Before, it was your routine in the morning.. But now you've also started praying in the evening? Carry on! Carry on! I'll see how long you'd pray him. "God, I'm sailing with the faith in you." "Kindly grace me and take me to the other end successfully." He won't just help you.. He'll kick you.. Kick you in such a way that.. You'd remember it in your entire life. Hanuman's devotee! Disbeliever of god. Go to sleep now. Why are you folding your hands and praying? Get up! Vijay, Get up! - Get up! - O god! - Your tea is getting cold. - Thank you. What are you drinking? The same that you drink at night. - I'm drinking it in the morning. - Give! Give it here. Give it.. Leave! Leave it! Are you acting with me? This is cold drink. Idiot! Do you know about your situation at night? I'm sorry. I hope I didn't misbehave. No, not much. Instead you came in like a good boy. Touched my feet. Took my blessings and promised me.. That you'd never drink liquor. That's it. No! I never did all this. But I can remember that I was.. Talking about sailing. Yes, one bottle was stuck up in your mouth. I've kept it safely. Oh, c'mon, I said sorry. Now will you kill me? Your life is showered for girls. How will I take it? Ok, stop joking. Have you prepared the list of those great men? - Shall we start with our work? - Yes. - Shall I read the names? - Yes. - First number is sage Ramdin. - Occupation? He's the trustee of five temples and seven mosques.? - That means he owns the paradise. - Yes. If not from temple he can enter from mosque. He smuggles and hides it in the temples. - After all he's a great soul. - Yes. Second number is.. - Hello, I'm Khatlewala! - Khatlewala. - Hello! - How's your salt business going? Salt business? I never sell salt. - But you do sell girls. - You bloody fool, idiot! We've come from Delhi's special crime branch. And we've the list of all your secret places. And we're given orders that you must be made bald.. And take out your procession on donkey. And all the girls whose life you've spoiled.. Will hit your bald with her footwear. And.. - This much is enough for him. Now number 2. - Ok. Hello! - Is it Dhaniram? - I'm just Dhani (rich) by name. - Otherwise I'm poor. - Yes, it seems you've a black tongue. That speaks everything true. - What rubbish! - Yes, we're calling from CBI, Delhi. What are you saying? Hello! Hello! You just see what I do tonight at the casino. All of them are connected with that casino. - Shall we go! - Ok. Whatever you say, but if they were from police department.. Or CBI they wouldn't have informed us before coming. Why they would have called us before? Think over it. He's right. Possible that somebody made fun with us. Or our enemy tried to threat us. Friends, whether it's a fun or enmity. We must be careful in any ways. It was ok, if PK, would be in the city. But if anything will happen in his absence.. Then who will dare to face him? If police has really come to know about our business.. Then they must have kept watch on every step of us. - Friends, I've an idea. - What's that? Master Brahmanand has come to our city.. - Brahmanand? - Yes.. His two disciples have come to our city. Let's invite them. Let's have a program of devotional hymns. And invite great personalities of the city. This way police will be diverted to us.. And our men will arrange to send the goods.. To the basement from temple. Wow! Excellent idea! Then why to wait for the good thing? - Invite them tomorrow. - Ok. - Goga sir! - Yes. You please send the invitation to everybody. Ok. Not a bad idea. Who are they? Who are you? We both are black thieves. - Black thieves? - Yes. - Yes, sir! - Catch them. Don't let them go. Catch them! Don't miss them. Don't let them escape. There! C'mon! Beat them! Beat! Catch them! Beat them! Beat! Catch them! There! Our luck really favours sometime. You always get carried away. She's not yours. She's my luck. Look, I'm elder to you. Listen to me. Pray your Hanuman for few more years. - She's your to be sister in law. - Sister in law? - Yes. You? How come you're here? - You? You.. - Don't say anything. - I thought you're joking. But you're congratulation! - Thank you. Is it good to enter in somebody's house at this night? Please don't misunderstand. Actually, those goons were standing down.. Who were forcing you that day. I thought something is fishy. So I came up. I hope you're alright. But how did you get my address? It's very simple. When they stopped down.. At this bungalow we immediately came up. - Who are you? - I'm the one who does everything for him. - What? - Yes. Ok, I'll call up the police now. Why do you drag the police in this matter? - They have left by now. - And we're also going. -Yes. But tell me your name please.. - He's Ajay and I'm Vijay. Yours? - Asha! But I hope you'd remember the address now. Yes! Address! Two disciple of Brahmanand. Oh! Disciple of Brahmanand? They are two disciples of master Brahmanand. The entire country is aware of their power. They reside in Himalayas cave and eat only roots. Meditation is their life. I've requested them for your betterment.. And made them come here from Himalayas. He's lying so much. Did you recognise him? - He's that same waiter of the hotel. - Yes. When star favours, any difficult work becomes easier. What can be done, so that we are out of trouble. So, ladies and gentlemen. - Priest! - Yes. I beg your pardon for disturbing you. I hope you've recognised us. Of course.

Miracle! - Cigarette? - Silly, do you call our offering, a cigarette? - Smoke! - Smoke, sir. Fast! Yes. Miracle! God! You're the heart reader. You must have understood my wish. Yes, my child. You're not the one that you appear. And only our intelligent eyes can see your real form. I'm your slave. You've proved your greatness. But, my child. We're also not the same that you think us. I'm an ordinary human. How can I understand? But, we promise you that before going from here.. We'll give you an eyesight to view everything clear. What? - Eyesight. - Oh! Come! Please come.

At the police station. - Mr. D'souza. Search the entire house. - Yes, sir. Mr. Ajay and Mr. Vijay. Did you see.. How far Law can reach? No matter how long it may be.. But it can never reach to a decent man's neck. This is the common excuse of every thief after arrest. Whereas both of you are arrested. It'll be very costly for you to arrest us, Mr. Inspector. For your information, I'm not just MA.. But also bachelor of Law. - MA LLB. - Along with this you're.. Also a thug, thief, loafer and cheater. I feel like laughing on you, inspector. Police keep charges on anybody. But court decides whether it's right or wrong. To which you say Law. Why? Why did you stop? And why are you silent now, Mr. MA. LLB? This beggar seems to be police's informer. - Yes.. - Aye, mister. Mind your language. You're talking with police commissioner Khanna. Commissioner! Salute, sir. Any big criminal can stammer in presence of police. You're just a child. You're right, commissioner sir. And you explain them about how decent we're. Yes! And the proof of your decency is with me. - "Till now you had forgotten god." - Yes. "Till now you had forgotten god." "Now you've started praying him.." "When you realised your wealth is decreasing." "And that made you restless." Commissioner sir! it's not a crime to sing a devotional song. Not at all, masters. But taking up a bogus inspector's.. 'Yes, Inspector Hirachand and Virachand..' '..from CBI. 'Sabji Mandi.' New Delhi.' 'And constable Pandu. Police station, Nagpada. Mumbai.' To say and to act are two different things, sir. And that's why Law punishes on the basis of proof. Very true! Mr. MA LLB, those notes worth 50000.. Have police's marking. And by now it must have got your fingerprints. Sir, we searched their entire house minutely. But notes are not found there. They didn't find anything. Nothing. No? How's it possible? Shall I tell you, sir? "Keep in mind what sages say." "Keep in mind what sages say." "It's better for you." "It's better for you." How long will you survive? We could release from here. Now Miss Kiran's turn. - Give me that address. - Address? I ate the address. - Ate? - Yes. Take it out. - Wait. Wait! Look at there. Look there only. - It came out. - It has come out. Here it is. 47 avenue. Ok. Listen, I'll go upstairs. And you wait for me at downstairs. If I won't come back after half an hour then.. - Shall we go then? - Ok. - Let's go. Please, come in. - Where's madam? - She's coming. Please, be seated. - Please sit down, Mr. Vijay. - Thank you. How do you know my name? The guest like yours name.. Is known to everybody in this house. I was waiting for you. Please be seated. Please, come. What will you drink and how? With soda, water or neat? I'm sorry but I never drink liquor alone. It's your fault and not mine. You didn't bring your partner with you. It seems he has stuck up there. - Please sit down. - Thank you. I knew you'd come alone. And that's why I've served two plates. Now let's come to the point. It seems you want to say something. I didn't wish to say. But let me tell you now. If you'd have stolen my mind instead of money.. Then 50000 would be of no value to you. I always believe in solid proof. Show me the skills of your mind. Then I'll fix the rate. Not only you but the entire.. World will be ready to rate my mind. Can you see this? Two pinch of the content of this bottle.. If added to water it become a fuel. Impossible. Rates are fixed for converting impossible into possible. In future, all the cars of the world will.. Run with the water mixed with this content. Future is never sure, Mr. Vijay? - But present is always yours, madam. - Ok. - Only two pinch. In presence of you. - Ok. - Then? - Ready? Fabulous. My god! We can rob the entire world like this. - It's my mind and not yours. - Oh, I see. How much will be the advance.. I must pay to you to keep my share? Add 2.5 in the amount that you brought from my house. You can take away 5. I know to appreciate the intelligence. - Thank you! - I'll just be in a moment. Ok? So, miss Suzie, how did you find my magic bottle? But how did you come to know my name? - Just how you came to know mine. - Oh! - So, I was telling you.. - Here we're, Mr. Vijay. - Thank you! - Take this. - Mr. Vijay! All are real. - Ok. then. - See you. - Have the dinner first. Now we'll daily take your dinner, madam. Bye! Bye! Ajay? Ajay! Where he must have gone? Where's Ajay, Miss Kiran? You seem to be very angry, sir. - May God bless you! - Where's Ajay, miss Kiran? May your pair remain untouched. I was going to ask you this question. - That your partner.. - Ajay is more than a brother to me. I'm impressed. What happened to your brother? Don't try to act smart. If anything will happen to him, I'll kill you. I liked this style of yours. You've declared the.. Punishment without charging the crime. Ajay is missing from the gate of your building from.. Yesterday night and he didn't come home entire night. God knows how he must have spent his night? Yesterday, I couldn't sleep for the entire night.. After just two meetings with you till now. You're dialing a wrong number. I never weigh my friend with beauty. Mind it. I'm not that type of a girl. I'm a buyer. And I've paid you 5 lakh rupee cash. Don't live under impression that you've bought something. You had asked for the partnership.. To convert 5 into 50. Over smartness is not allowed amongst robbers. And even thief never trust the thief.. Who does the thievery at thief's house.. People like you must be doing this thievery, madam. I never do any thievery. I'm expert in swapping. And that too openly. And now it comes to Ajay. If he won't return home by today evening.. Then I'll use my hands instead of mind. And I can confidently say that.. It's as sharp and strong as my.. Ajay! Ajay! - Ajay! - Who's it? Let me sleep. Stupid, you've spoiled my sleep and now you're sleeping? C'mon, get up. Get up! Get up! I'm here? I was there. Who brought me here? Where were you? I was waiting for you outside Kiran's house. What are you saying? That's a story of yesterday. Where were you in between? - Yesterday? - Yes. Tell me. What had happened? A blast and then everything turn into dark. - You're injured here. - Oh, yes. Now I remember. I was waiting for you and suddenly I felt a stroke.. On my head. And I got faint. Faint? Who were they? Where they had taken you? I don't know about that. But after that I got my consciousness now. No, Ajay, it's not possible. Think over it. Who were they? Where they had taken you? No, Vijay. I just can't remember anything. You'll, Ajay. Just stress your mind. - Where they had taken you? - No, I can't remember anything. Do you doubt anybody? Not just doubt. But I'm quite sure that it's Kiran's plot. Kiran? What this Kiran is? Thank you very much for given me.. So much of importance. You must be surprised about how did I come here? Mr. Vijay! After the first visit, frequent visit is common. This is the amount that you'd taken away from me.. For converting water into fuel. No! No! No! I could have taken it away. But no! Do you know why? Because only jeweller can value the diamond. Whereas, both of you are precious diamonds. If you're ready to work with me then this is the token.. Otherwise.. otherwise these.. Money will automatically come to me. Gentleman, now the ball is in your coat. Decision will be yours. Ok? Bye! Did you understand what is she? What? 5 lakh? Have you bought diamonds? I've bought them for you. Two precious diamonds. Have you tested them? What if they are proved a glass piece? Kiran never failed to test glass pieces and diamonds. I know that. But, miss Kiran. I want the proof. A solid proof. Ace! King! Queen is here, sir. And here too. But where are you? Over there or here? Wherever the market is hot. Excuse me, gentleman! Ok, tell me. Have you decided then? Will you work for us or.. If we didn't intend to do then your notes.. Would have come to you by now. Right? May your pair be graced! Have you come out from earth or dropped from sky? It's a question of 5 lakh, madam. Now I'll drop from anywhere you say. - Will you do the robbery? - Sure! - Will you rob the bank? - In a daylight. - And hijacking? - If you'd be with us.. - Will you do any murder? - Yes.. - No! No murder.. - Shut up! How many times I explained you not to interfere.. - While dealing the business? - She's telling us to murder. Ok, madam. I don't mind murdering anybody.. As it is your beauty has killed me. Tell me who do you want me to murder? We'll tell you that with times. - Then now.. - For now you can go back.. To your other queen if you wish. - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! - Bye! Have you gone mad? She was telling us to murder. With the sight of a girl you forget yourself. You need to be energetic to reach your goal.. And not in your sense. - You won't understand. - What I want understand? What's your goal for which you're ready to murder? Ajay, you must not ask questions in friendship. Have your concern with friendship you'll be happy. That means you'll do murder? I'll see how you do that. What's so special in this photo.. That's making you so excited? This is just the sand of our way. But it's coming with the tornado. Before this sand comes to us with this tornado.. Find out from where this sand has come? And by what speed it's coming to us? C'mon, run! - Ajay! - What happened? Are you tired? I'm not Hanuman's devotee like you.. That I can keep running? Look, Asha, if you taunt me I'll start with my devotion again. Then you'll remain unmarried in your entire life. No way! Now I can't live without you for even a moment. - Really? - Yes. I love you, Asha! I love you. This locket? What's the matter? Whose symbol you're carrying along with you? Asha, this is the only one symbol I've of my parents. - My father had sold me off in my childhood. - What? A father sold off his son? No, Asha. Don't misunderstand him. My mother was very serious. We didn't have money for her treatment. I remember very little. Papa snatched me away from mother's hand. Mummy, screamed.. That let me die but don't sell my child. Papa cried and hugged me tightly for the last time. Then what happened? Those who had bought me, also died after some time. And I became an orphan. I worked hard in daytime and studied in the streetlight at night. I obtain the degree of MA. LLB. But I failed.. To continue with my practise. I tried to commit suicide at the last. But Vijay saved my life. And I got a new life. And then you.. I can't forget this obligation of yours in my life. Will you bring him home tonight for the dinner? Please.. To prove you that I can cook food.. I sent the maid home. Very good! Now you, please be seated. Some things are left. I'll just come. It seems your prayers have turned fruitful. What a girl she's! You also start with the prayer from today. You will also find one like her. - She stays alone? - I didn't ask her. - But why are you asking? - No! It's nothing like that. Ajay, please open the door. Shall I go? Yes, tell me! - Police?! - Police?! - Police?! How come they are here? - See.. - Commissioner sir! - Salutation, sir. Commissioner, sir. You're following us everywhere. We've come here with a marriage proposal. If you don't believe me then ask the girl. How dare you step in this house? You're asking us as if we've entered in your house. Mr. MA. LLB. Today you'll forget all the books Law. - Arrest them. - Excuse me! Don't misunderstand them. - I've invited them for dinner, brother. - Brother?! Please don't bother about the dinner. - Only one glass of water will be fine. - Water? Can we have a glass of water, brother? Asha, from when do you know them? - From the day he has saved my life. - Yes. How can the infamous person take care of anybody's prestige? Those who have unmarried sisters and daughters.. At home should think before giving opinions. What's this, Asha? I was going to tell you everything, brother. Shut up! Get out! I'll shoot you if I see you in this house again. Out! Thank you, Asha. You didn't do this right, brother. Enough, I've heard everything after this. You go and send Sherry to me. - Have I done any mistake, sir? - No! Your stars have favoured you. I'll award you much gold for this information. Thank you! Thank you very much, sir. Isn't it necessary to meet Ajay personally.. Before rewarding him? No, Sherry. Whatever Ajay has told to that girl. He can't be anybody else other than my son. What will happen now? He's enemy's friend. Then make him an enemy. Did you get it? Hello! Hello! You can't escape from your death, Sherry. And I'll be the cause of your death. Key! Take the right turn. I said turn towards right. Car turns by steering and not by the order. And at present steering is in my control. That's why I'm telling you to turn towards right. It seems you didn't read the newspaper today. Yesterday night, a murder took place. And the dead body is still missing. Keep quiet. Otherwise, same thing can happen with you. Whether it happens with me or not.. But I know about that dead body. If you don't mind, just turn back and see. Dead body is lying in the car. Police is following the car. And you're on the driving seat. Good luck! Goodbye! Cheating with Law is not so easy, Mr. Vijay. Inspector, I'm innocent. I didn't do this murder. This car is also not mined. It's a plotting against me. - Court will decide that. C'mon. - Look, inspector! - Constable, take care of this car. - Ok, sir. O god! When wills this crime and murders end? Let's see the dead body once. - No! I get scared. - It's just a dead body and not a ghost. My situation becomes awkward.. When I see the dead bodies. If I'll see this dead body. I won't be able to sleep for the entire night. I'll get the fever. You're very strange. God may not give sorrows to anybody. Only then the constable like me won't be found in this area. You know that. C'mon light my cigarette. Come on, give it to me. I wish nobody to have sorrowful days in life. - Please light the cigarette. - Yes, sure. - Thanks! - No mention. Yes, it was very nice. Too good! Ajay! Aju! Are you talking to me? Are you still disappointed with brother's behaviour? So much of anger on my love? - But I love your anger, too. - Look! I think your Ajay's face resembles mine. I'm seeing you for the first time. Sir, madam is calling you. Tell her I'm coming. Did you hear this? Now you must have understood. Ajay! Ajay, I'm Asha! Your Asha. I don't know any Asha! Ajay! Tell me! Your friend is in the lock up under the charge of a murder. If anything will happen to Vijay, I'll kill you very first. Yes, sure! You can kill me. But shall I drop you to the police station first? Please, come. C'mon. It was my craziness that I loved you. I will forget you. Brother was right. You're a liar. A decisive. I'll tell brother to send you to the lock up. Only then you'll realise. That innocence of yours and bashful look. I'll also tear off your letter. "Somebody has written a love letter to me." "Somebody has written a love letter to me." "It states that he's crazy for me." "Today, when he met me personally.." "He isn't speaking anything." "I don't understand this style of him" "Somebody has written a love letter to me." "He looks at me with so much of love." "He looks at me with so much of love." "But when I look at him he avoids meeting eyes." "Actually, he loves me a lot." "Actually, he loves me a lot." "If anybody try to tease me, he never spare them." "What this secret is.." "What this secret is.." "Do you know what it means actually? "I don't understand this style of him" "Somebody has written a love letter to me." "Those who feel shy with the sight of a beautiful lady." "Those who feel shy with the sight of a beautiful lady." "How can he claim to be in love?" "What a sweetheart I've got?" "What a sweetheart I've got?" "Such lovers are very rare in this world." "He's very mean.." "He has a new style of attracting me." "I don't understand this style of him" "Somebody has written a love letter to me." "It states that he's crazy for me." "Today, when he met me personally.." "He isn't speaking anything." "I don't understand this style of him" "Somebody has written a love letter to me." Ajay, you and here? Who told you that I'm locked here? That, smart woman. Oh! Kiran! That means she also knows him very well. - Whom? - Nobody. Ajay, I've told you this before and even today I'm telling you. Please forget me. You won't get anything other than defame.. With the company of a criminal. No, Vijay! I've forgotten her, whom I should have. I've refused to recognise Asha. Ajay! What did you do this? You can never get such a nice girl.. And family being in my company. Vijay! Which is that secret that's more than.. Our friendship for you. Even after the murder charges.. You don't want to disclose it. It's not a secret. It's a fact. I'm involved in a murder case. And now my bail is also not possible. Why it isn't possible? I'll do anything to give your bail. You've got the bail. Sir has called you. Please, come sir. You please sit here. Constable has gone to bring him. He'll come soon. Thank you! Uncle! You? May you have a long life, my child! Won't you come in my hug, my child? Vijay, I didn't recognise him. Ajay, he's Mr. Ghanshyam Das. - A dearest friend of my father. - Oh! - He's the richest and.. - Enough! Don't praise me more. As it is I've put on a lot. Pleased to meet you. We just can't control our happiness when we find.. Somebody from our own after many years. But, Vijay. You really scared me today. When I saw police arresting you on the road.. I just couldn't believe on my eyes. Right from the DIG to the inspector. I had to convince them that.. They have misunderstand something. They said dead body was found in the car. I asked them, was it Vijay's car? They said no. But he was driving it. When I asked them about the dead body.. They said it's disappeared. Disappeared? Then? Then what? I told them that the day you find the.. Dead body and prove that Vijay has murder him then.. Hang me onto noose in place of him. They kept quiet and I got relief. Vijay, my child. If I hadn't paid your bail today.. How I'd have faced your mother? Mother? Vijay's mother? Vijay, what type of a friend you're? You didn't introduce your friend with your mother? I'll come to your house some other day.. - And explain you everything. - Why some other day? How many days have passed that you came to Mumbai? Nearly a year. And you didn't get time to meet me in this entire year? Actually, I was so helpless that.. Anyway, let it be. Will you come now? And also bring your mother along with. You too, come with him, my child. Yes, of course. If he'll bring me, I'll definitely come. Ok then, see you. Before taunting you should have asked me the detail. Vijay, my child. I forgot to ask you something. Did you get the information about your father's murderer? If he's alive, I'll definitely find him one day. God knows when that day will come? Ok then, see you. Vijay, how many secrets you've kept from me? And I've considered you everything of mine. I can understand, Ajay. If I'd be at your place.. I also would have felt hurt to know about this. But believe me, if you'd be at my place.. You also would have done the same thing. Never, Vijay! You know that I've always craved for love. I've carved for the parental love in my life. And still you did this? Your mother can't be mine, too? No, Ajay. She's your mother. But.. But she has lost her mental balance with a shock. She's not getting the right treatment. Which is that shock to which.. She's not getting the right treatment? Tell me, Vijay! I'll finish off myself to get her treatment. By swear of me. Tell me. - Tell me, Vijay. Otherwise.. - Ajay! Don't say that. I don't have strength to resist more shocks. That black night.. I was studying in my room. Are you talking about Sir Ghanshyam Das? Sir? He's a smuggler, a murderer, a robber. Today I've seen everything personally. See, this is his real picture. It's not possible. It can't be Sir Ghanshyam Das's photo. I'm sure this is a misunderstanding. Now take some rest. Tomorrow morning you've to go to Delhi. Morning? First I've to make him arrest in the morning. Everybody will believe me.. When he'll be sentenced to death. Mr. Vijay! Mr. Vijay! Papa! Papa! - Papa, who did this? - Vijay! Vijay, my child, you please run away from here. Run away! He'll kill you. He'll kill me, too. He'll kill all of us. Who, mummy? Did you see him? who was he? Why don't you say something? Tell me, mummy. Why your papa is sleeping here? - Take him upstairs. - Mummy! Tomorrow is your exam, I suppose? You've still not slept? What are you doing here? - Go and relax now. - Mummy? - Go! - Mummy! - Go to sleep. - Yes, mummy, I'll go to sleep. You please come here, mummy. Come.. Shanti, please take care of her. - Hello! - Vijay, my child? Ghanshyam here. Give the phone to papa. - Uncle! Uncle, papa is no more. - What? - Is sister in law alright? - Mummy! Mummy has also gone madly, uncle. God knows suddenly what happened.. Papa! Papa! Papa! This man's death is mother's treatment, right? I'll kill him and bring him to our mother. My son has fallen in love with a girl and that too, which girl? With a top most enemy's sister. He's a friend of one, and is in love with other's sister. Had you seen the locket properly? I've seen it, Sherry. And my eyes are very sharp. Ajay is my son and I'll meet him at any cost. Then why don't you meet him in this appearance? He'll be known as Sir Ghanshyam's son. No, Sheery. It's not possible. When I had sold him off.. Sir Ghanshyam was not in existence. - That time I was.. I was.. - But he was too small that time. And as per Mack's information, he doesn't.. Remember about his childhood very clearly. What will happen if he'd remember his father's face? Then what's use now, PK? By now Vijay must have told him everything. And now he must hate PK's face. Whether he loves me or hates me. But he's my son. Ok, then let's go to Vijay and ask your son from him. Sheery! Don't cross your limits. If I've a fatherly heart. I also have a dangerous mind. I'll go to commissioner Khanna's house.. And meet his sister. Commissioner Khanna is searching for you. And even then you want to take this risk? I don't mind taking this risk for my son. - Yes! - Is Asha at home? - Yes, she's. Please come. Please, come.. - Have a seat. - Thank you! What's your name? Tell her Ajay's father wants to meet her. Yes! I'm Asha. - Long live, my child. - You. My child, I'm the unfortunate father of Ajay.. Who can't meet his son even after finding him. What? I didn't get you. My child, I need your help. I'm sorry. But I can't help you in this matter. I've forgotten Ajay completely. I don't want to see his face. He refused to identify me. No, my son can't be like this. You don't know. But he's trapped. And that's why your brother is also prejudiced about him. He has got a company of a wrong person. And he has prompted him so much.. - That he considers me his enemy. - What? Only you can convince Ajay. He'll never refuse you. Please bring him to me once. I'll clear all his misunderstanding. I'll give him everything that he hasn't find till today. Fatherly love, wealth and fame. And your brother also won't misunderstand him then. Please bring him to me once. I beg of you. Lift-man! Lift-man! Just check the lift! What's wrong with it? Sir, you and here? Actually, my car was spoiled. So I thought of meeting you. But you, police officers don't have time for us. What are you saying, sir? C'mon, let's go. - No, I met Asha just now. - Really? - Now I'll come with your invitation. - Ok. Ok, bye! Asha! - Asha! - Yes, brother! Sir had come home. Did you serve him the best? He didn't give that chance. He was just telling me about his misery. I wish if you'd be present, all your misunderstanding.. - About Ajay would be clear today. - Ajay? - How's Ajay concern with sir? - He's Ajay's father. Ajay had told me everything about him. Ajay is the son of this big personality? Yes. And he doesn't know about it yet. Brother, if you allow me.. It's very important for me to meet Ajay. - Yes, sure! You can go. - Thank you, brother! But sir never discussed about his son.. Come in, my child. Why are you standing in dark, papa? - Why don't you come in light? - I'll come, my child. But before that I want to tell you something. The face that you'll see now.. Many times it is presented to you in the wrong format. It's identified as a murderer. And you hate him. What are you saying, papa? I'm craving to see my parents from so many years. Do you remember your mother's face? Yes, papa. How's she? Where's she? - I failed to save her life even after selling you. - Papa! Control yourself, my child! You've to resist many shocks today. No! No, this is not possible. O god! How you're testing me? Don't be sad, my child. I'm your father. I'm ready to give my life to keep your words. A son met his father after so many years. But how? Papa! Papa, tell me that you didn't kill Vijay's father. Tell me that it's a lie. Mere lie. Who will decide truth and lie? Who will believe me? But, papa! Vijay is my friend. He can't lie to me. And a father can lie to his son? You don't know, papa. Today I'm alive because of Vijay. He has given me a new life. I'm under his obligation. Then pay off to this obligation. Kill me and present me to him. Enough, papa. Don't say anything more. Otherwise, I'll go mad. My child, if possible, bring your friend to me. I will resolve all his misunderstandings. - Really? Papa! - My child! No! No, it's not possible, Ajay. Tell me that you were joking. A dirty joke, that you'd never do again. You're joking with me, Vijay.. You're telling me to refuse to accept him as my father? You know that I'm craving for this happiness from childhood. And you're telling me to forget it? Ajay, once again I'm telling you he can't be your father. I can't fail to recognise the face that's clear.. In my mind right from my childhood. - No, Ajay! That rascal is not your father. - Vijay! If it weren't you, I'd have cut off his tongue. Look, Vijay! Parent's relation is always higher than the rest. Please don't abuse it. Why don't you believe me.. That my father didn't kill your father. I know that rascal very well. And now I'm sure that you're also his dirty blood. You're still alive because of his son. Don't forget. Look at there. Oh! So, you've brought your father's swine, too? No! He had saved my life once. Today I'm pardoning his life. Balance is clear. Your balance, promises and words. It says, do good and cast it into the river. I did good and caste it to the drainage. Enough, Vijay. I can't listen to anything more. I might not raise.. A child inherits traits of his father. Kindness is always lost upon an ungrateful man. Stop it, Vijay. Even the god couldn't keep patience.. After 100 abuses. Whereas I'm an ordinary human being. Not just human. You're a black spot.. On the name of friend and friendship. Don't say anything more, Vijay. If you want to stop me then tell me that you're my friend.. - And not that rascal, bloody swine's son. - Vijay! "A friend has done worst than an enemy." "He has insulted the word friendship." "This friendship of many years.." "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "My friend.." "My friend.." "My friend, you turned your face.." "It's like, my god has turned face from me." "It's like, my god has turned face from me." "This friendship of many years.." "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "I've shed my blood for you in your difficult times." "I've shed my blood for you in your difficult times." "How come your blood became so thin?" "What is this day I've come across today?" "Your friendship.." "Your friendship was my life.." "Being close to me.." "Today you've robbed everything of mine." "It's like, my god has turned face from me." "This friendship of many years.." "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "Just like the lines created in water.." "All the promises of friendship have broken today." "Just like the lines created in water.." "All the promises of friendship have broken today." "My friend's friendship was a weak wall." "Why this happened with me?" "Why this happened with me?" "Whose curse affected us?" "With this indifference of yours.." "I feel I'm dead today." "It's like, my god has turned face from me." "This friendship of many years.." "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "Why it has broken up in a moment?" "My friend, you turned your face.." "It's like, my god has turned face from me." "It's like, my god has turned face from me." Who's it? A friend.. Whom you consider your enemy. Friend? I don't have any friend. Now I don't have any friend. Whether you consider me a friend or enemy. Never mind if you hate me.. Those who don't have a friend also do not have an enemy. - Vijay! Vijay, you need support. - Support? - Who will give support to me? - I'm there. Control yourself, Vijay. When one door is closed.. God always opens the other door for you. - He opens? - Yes. Ok, let's go. Vijay! Ajay! You take so much care of me. You do so much for me. Your obligation.. How will I pay off to this obligation of your, Ajay? How? A small support is enough for the drowning person. Vijay will never forget your obligation in his life. He was continuously remembering your son Ajay. It seems he's really hurt. I hope you're also not hurt. What? You're showing sympathy towards enemy. Never show pity for the enemy in your trap. And the enemy, like Vijay? Your enemy is still unconscious. Tell me how I must behave with him? Just like a friend behaves with the other friend. Assure him that he has nobody in this life except you. And what should I do when he'll be assured.. That I've nobody in life except him? What should I do next? We must reach to his mother. Do something that he'll completely forget himself.. In your company and he'll take you to his mother. I promise you. I'll definitely reach to his mother one day. That's like you, Kiran. If you wish you can take him.. To our bungalow at Madh island. There both of you will be alone. And complete silence around will help your work done easier. Ok? Ok. O god! Ajay, get me a cup of tea. Ajay! Where am I? Yesterday night I was on the road. Whose house it must be? It's not of your enemy. Those who don't have a friend.. Also do not have an enemy. - Tea! - Don't say that, miss Kiran. Only a friend can do so much that you did for me at night. Now that you've called me your friend. I hope you won't consider me your enemy now. - Miss Kiran.. - My name is Kiran. Kiran, before you misunderstand.. Let me clear all your misunderstanding. Some things are such that.. More you try to go away more it comes closer. Kiran! Kiran, the person for whom you're working.. Is the biggest enemy of my life. It's between you and him. I was talking about you and me. But, Kiran.. love with an enemy? We left from home to kill an enemy.. But when we came face to face, we fell in love with him. What if I ask the proof of your love? I can offer my life for you. I must reach to him first. And you must come with me to reach to him. Where? You must not ask questions in love. Please come! Come in! Kiran, you had promised me to take you to PK? Where have you.. I had told you.. Not to ask questions in love. - But.. - Did you get the answer? Kiran has gone with Vijay to our bungalow at Madh island. I've personally been there, PK. But Kiran didn't reach there. - Then where's she? - Mack came to inform you the same. But you became angry. Tell me, Mack. But remember. If your information proved wrong.. You know the result. And what if it'll be true? - Then I'll peel off her skin. - Then come with me. Then decide who's honest and who's dishonest? Let's go. Papa, I've heard everything. I'll do this work. No, my child. I won't let you do this dangerous work. Papa, now your life is very precious for me. If anything will happen to you then.. Nothing will happen to me. And Tiger is with me. - Who's Tiger? - Tiger! You don't know his strength. I'm sorry to say papa, but you're not aware of my strength. And also not of Vijay. We've tackled many such Tigers till now. Wonderful! Do you realise now, papa? PK, it's proved that he's your blood. But still, my child. I won't let you go alone. Kiran, I know you love me. But you don't know the outcome of this love. Outcome? "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "But, I'm helpless at my crazy heart.." "It doesn't listen to me." "It doesn't listen to me." "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "One, who fears of death can never fall in love." "Life is as good as death in love." "Life is nothing compared to love." "Even the death can't overcome the love." "If this wasn't true then.." "If this wasn't true then.." "Any lovers wouldn't have spent.. A madly life for his love." "Heart doesn't listen to me." "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "Whether she was Laila, Shiri, Heer or Sohani." "They are still remembered after death." "Who offered their life for love." "Their fragrance is still felt in the seasons." "There's something. Otherwise my heart.." "There's something. Otherwise my heart.." "Wouldn't be so obstinate.." "To offer my life for you." "Heart doesn't listen to me." "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "Who doesn't know the outcome of love?" "But, I'm helpless at my crazy heart.." "It doesn't listen to me." "It doesn't listen to me." Kiran, I used to believe that nobody could impress me in this world. But your love has really impressed me today. I just can't believe myself, Vijay. When I met you for the first time, I had seen a dream. Let's go somewhere very far from here. So far.. where except you, I and your mother.. Mother? How do you know about my mother? Vijay, I.. Is there any phone here? Yes, but it's too far from here. Vijay! Vijay! Please don't go! I'm scared. Don't worry. I'll just come. Ok? - That's Kiran's car. - That means Vijay also will be here. - We'll go and shoot them now. - No. Nobody will take any step without my order. Listen. You go and bring Kiran. I'll take care of Vijay. No, sir. If we'll leave you alone, PK will shoot us. Ok, you please come with me. And, all of you bring Kiran. Excuse me! I want to make an urgent call to Bombay. - Can I please? - Yes, sure. - Thank you! How much time it takes to get the line? If the line is clear it won't even take 2 minutes. - Will you have some tea? - Can I have something cold? Yes, sure. I'll bring it now. Hello! Trunk booking! I'm calling from 43431. I want to make a call to Bombay. I want to listen to the conversation.. Of the person calling from outside. - Yes! Bombay! - You can listen to it from here. Yes, Bombay number is 212133. Shanti, Vijay here. Mr. Vijay, where are you? Madam is not well. What happened to her? - She's getting the attacks. - Look, Shanti. This is not the first time that she's getting attacks. You know which injection can give her relief. Injections are not in stock from last two days. Injections out of stock? Look, Shanti, I can't reach there soon. You please go and get the injections. But how can I leave madam in this condition? I don't know anything. You please hurry up. Go and get the injections. Ok! Shanti! Shanti! Where's she? Where's this Shanti? Shan.. Send them in! - Commissioner.. - I'm sorry.. I'm sorry, Vijay. - Police is trying it's best to find her. - What? But how did you come to know that Kiran is missing? - Kiran? - Yes, Kiran. My friend. Who took me to her house to save my life. Who's she from whom she wants to save you? PK! PK? Yes, PK. This is his photo. What's your enmity with him? Commissioner! This man has murdered my father. - Your father? - He's right, Commissioner. My child, once again I'm telling you.. Please come to my house with your mother. Otherwise her life will also be at risk. You didn't do this right by hiding all this from police. Anyway, you please call up on 212133 first. How did you come to know this number? Is my mother alright? Your mother is missing. Nurse had come to report here. Vijay! Vijay! Listen to me.. Excuse me! How far is Hasratganj from here? - Hasratganj? - Yes. Why are you looking at me like this? It seems you're new in Lucknow. Sister, this is Mumbai and not Lucknow. - Mumbai? - Yes. - How can this be Mumbai? - What's the matter? - I don't know why she's.. Calling Mumbai, Lucknow? - Sister, this is Mumbai. - No, this is Lucknow. It seems she's mad. You rascal! Where's my mother? Where's your murderer father? Where's his secret place? Tell me about his accomplices. Why don't you say anything? Did you come across my father's accomplices? And did you see my power? Coward! You're using your manpower to control me? If you're so brave then release me once.. And then see my strength. - Sir, police! - You please go. Vijay! Vijay! Vijay, what happened? Who beat you? Who were they? - Inspector! - Yes, sir. Take care of him. Mumbai! How come I reached to Mumbai? Vijay! Vijay! Vijay! Sir, let's take her to the hospital. No! It'll be a police case if we take her to the hospital. Take her home. We'll call the doctor at home. Hurry up! Shanti! Shant.. Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Where are you, mummy? Where will I find you now...? Mummy! Have patience, Vijay! Police will find your mother soon. And what if it'll fail? It's impossible. Impossible! Impossible! If this is impossible.. Then why police failed to arrest PK till now? Do you have the answer to this? Tell me that.. he'll definitely be arrested one day. But what will happen.. If something will happen with my mother today? What will happen then, commissioner? Will police.. Be able to bring my mother back? Will you be able to give my mother back to me? Will you be able to give my mother back to me? No, commissioner! You and your police can't help me by any means. Go away from here for god's sake. Leave me alone. PK took away my mother. My mother is with him. I'm sure about it. Ok, fine. I'm going.. But let me tell you something before going. How can you doubt PK for kidnapping your mother? I'm sure about it, commissioner. If it's not true then his son wouldn't be found.. At the gate of this building. Who's his son? Who's his son? Now I'll never take that rascal's name again. Never! Ajay! PK's son? Mummy?! Doctor! What's the matter? Is everything fine? Actually, Mr. Ajay made an accident and was disturbed. Accident? My son is so emotional? What's the matter, my child? - A woman came in front of my car. - Woman? Yes.. Doctor said she's very serious. - I'm so disturbed. - No need to be disturbed in this. Many people die with accident in big cities. Consult the doctor and arrange for a nurse. We've many other things to do. What's that? Search the entire city. We must find Vijay's mother. I'll tackle Kiran! - Asha! Asha, come soon. - Yes, brother. Asha! That day Ajay's father had come here, right? - Yes. - Look at these pictures and tell me who was he? - He! - Are you sure? - Yes. - Very good. He's that murderer.. He had killed my husband. You're one from his group. Tell me who brought me here. Tell me. Where's my Vijay? I'll kill you. You please tell me where's my Vijay? Where's my Vijay? Is she the same? Well done, my child! Great! But how did you come to know that she's Vijay's mother? When she came in sense she started screaming.. With the sight of your photo and was saying.. - That you're a murderer. And I.. - Did you kill her? No! I wanted to kill her. But for now I've given her sleeping tablet. Papa, I kept my promise. Now you please keep your promise. Tell me how can we live with respect in the society? Come! Come and see it yourself. Leave me! I said leave! Leave! I said leave! Leave me.. Leave her. Asha has come to meet me. No, Ajay. This girl has no place in your life now. What do you mean? You must give this sacrifice for the new life you want to live. Papa! Ajay, this man is a fraud, cheat, criminal and impostor. Girl! You haven't seen my anger yet. My brother has told me everything about you. At least you should have kept your son away from all this. Shut up, Asha! Stop your nonsense. I don't want to see your face who can dare to insult.. My father in my presence. Brother is coming here with police. Let's run away from here. Otherwise you'll repent in your entire life. Unfortunate people come and go off.. From this world while crying. Take her inside and locks her. And keep watch on her. Let's go, papa! Ajay! I never knew you could go down to this level. Which is this place, papa? Wait for some time. You'll come to know everything. I'll just come. Vijay, your mother's life is in danger. - How do you know that? - What all I know.. I'll tell this to you later. - But, you.. - Don't worry about me. Your mother's life is at risk. C'mon! Come on! Sir Ghanshyam Das? Yes, my child, another form of your father. I had told you.. The day I'll find Vijay's mother.. Police will never be able to reach to PK. Because today, PK and his entire life will.. Completely vanish with this old woman. And only Sir Ghanshyam Das will remain alive. Who's a respectable person of the society.. Who gives charity. And world salutes him. Also accept my salutation, uncle. - Vijay, my child. My child! - Mummy! Mummy, what happened to you? I'm fine. You please don't worry about me. He's.. that murderer. He killed your father. Don't worry, mummy. So, uncle! You always used to complain that I never come here. Today I've kept my promise. Today mummy and I, both are here. But I'm sorry to say that after some time.. You won't exist in this world. Uncle! I used to play with these toys in my childhood. Now I've become young. Now these hands need your throat. How will you reach to him when I'm here? Tell your mother to pray for you. You, disloyal, she's the mother of a brave man. I'm a lioness's son. Mind it. No, Sherry! He's my hunt. I've promised him that if I'm a brave mother's son.. I'll fight with him alone and fulfil his wish. Once again, I'm telling you, Vijay. Did you see my strength? And I'm giving you one more chance. Then don't complain that you were slipped. And you had to defeat. Take this. Ajay! Winner is always decided in the last game. Sit quietly. Or else I'll shoot you. I can defeat in 14 rounds of each game, Ajay. But in the 15th one. So! This is the 15th and last round, right? I had told you that I'd win the last game. I've come to enemy's house with complete preparation. Sir! Tell your men to throw away the gun. Otherwise you'll lose your son. Sherry! Throw it away. Throw! Vijay! Don't shoot my son. Let's join hands. No need of it, sir. Only one bullet. I'll hit one bullet to you and your son's life will be saved. P.K. Vijay! Vijay! My child! My child! Ajay! Ajay! What did you do this? If you wouldn't released the enemy once.. Who has released him, papa? Who left him? I thought if I miss the target he'll shoot at me. Liar! Disloyal! You told me that you're under Vijay's obligation. That I'm his friend. Our own blood matters more than everything. Would I have offered my father for his mother? But you said, you're not his son. If I'd not said so, you'd not have stopped screaming. Papa would have killed you.. And Vijay wouldn't have come in my trap. Sherry, go and demolish the den with dynamite. Papa's illegal life should be completely washed out.. Before police reaches. Is that clear? Get it! Yes, Sherry! C'mon, do it fast. - And I'll kill you, sir! - Vijay! My child, Vijay. Vijay! He's alive, my son. Who son? And whose son? It says needy stoops to everything however mean. And I did the same. And now you'll meet death like an animal. Such a big fraud? I'll peel off your skin. Animals skin can be peeled off and not of humans PK. Which can be useful to others after death. Your skin won't be used for anything. Where are you going? I still have to explain you how you got trapped in my plot. Vijay! That day when I was standing down.. At Kiran's house.. Yes. Then what happened? It was our good luck that he locked me in the same room.. Which he had built in memory of his son. Mack, this is a special room of PK. He has built it in memory of his son. What? PK's son is dead? He might be alive but you'd be definitely killed. He had sold off his son in his childhood. - And these statues? - It's the symbol of him. He also has the same statue's pendant. And PK is madly searching for it till today. But I don't understand how come.. Kiran told you to lock this man here? And I decided at the same moment.. That I'll be your lost son. To reach to the enemy I made my friend, my enemy. What if something would have happened to you? This life was under your obligation, my friend. So what if it'd have offered for you? I've hurt you a lot Vijay. Please, forgive me. Shall I? Ok, I've forgiven you. Really? Thank you! - You're welcome! - Stop! Mr. Ajay! After cheating PK, you got cheated here. Did you forget your lover? I've been loyal to PK from so many years. If you wish her life then hand over PK to me. No, Ajay, don't leave him even if I die. - Sherry! - Ajay! - Ok, Sherry! You leave Asha. We'll leave PK. - Ok PK! Sherry? That's a good boy! I'm also loyal to you, PK. The son whom you're searching for.. Since so many years. At least meet him once. This is the locket. In memory of which you've made an entire room. And this is the photo that.. Nobody can have except your son. Now you might ask me.. Why did I keep it secret even thought I knew everything. Because I wanted this son to be alive.. At the time of performing last rituals of his father. So that your soul might get rest. And the time has come now, PK. Do you remember Hari Singh? Whom you had thrown to the hungry tigers? Yes, I'm his only one daughter. And today.. I'm throwing you to these two tigers. C'mon, PK. Sherry! C'mon! Take your revenge. Mummy, take this revolver. And shoot him. Take your revenge. I'll tackle the Law. C'mon. You rascal! I'll kill you.. It's my job to kill people and not the newcomers like you. If anybody will move from here, I'll kill this woman. C'mon, Sherry! Mummy! - Mummy! - Vijay, my child! - Mummy! - Vijay, my child! Child! - Mummy! So, sir! Didn't I tell you that.. Who will take care of you if we won't be there? And Vijay, we've got detailed information about.. You and your friend, Ajay. You're Dinanath's son, right? Yes, commissioner sir, but how come you.. You've increased our job by hiding everything from before. I must say, Commissioner. If you had not come on time I'd have lost my mother. Anyway, everything happens for better. But I didn't understand something. When did you come to know that Ajay is not PK's son.. But your friend? Commissioner, it happened in presence of PK.. When I came here and mummy hugged me.. She softly told me that Ajay is just doing a drama. Don't misunderstand him. If that was the case, Ajay. Then why didn't you tell this to Vijay from before? Ah! I was helpless, commissioner. His accomplices used to be around me all the time. I see.. Did you hear this, PK? You used to underestimate them. But they are proved to be smarter than you. Take him away. And listen! Both of you come to my house tonight. I've to talk to you something very important. - Let's go. - Won't you hug your father for the last time? No, he's not my father. He's my father. Father, at least now you tell me how did you get those three queens? Just how you had got three jacks. That's where I made mistake. If I'd have made three aces.. How would you have made three aces, my dear? Those three aces were with me. - What? - Yes. I'm carrying it from that day onwards.. To show it to you. Now, this is the limit. Oh, sorry! Sorry! "At God, there's delay but not denial." "At God, there's delay but not denial."
