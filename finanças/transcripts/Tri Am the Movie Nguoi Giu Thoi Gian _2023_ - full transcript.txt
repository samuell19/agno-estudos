"Tri Am", "Soulmate", to me, is someone who understands my music. More than 20 years have passed, but for the audience to still stand by me, to still sing along with me? It's beyond what I could ever expect. What scares me the most is that I won't be able to brew up good ideas, I'd lose my confidence, the creative touch to bind to the work. I've never been afraid of what others would do. I'm only afraid that I won't be able to do something and not making it deserving of everything I've received for the past 20 years. Regarding difficulty, this show is extreme. It presented me with many challenges and other places where I could see my mistakes. Some of them were at the very start. That was a flaw I had to accept. But this also led me to experiences both wonderful and worthwhile. Through this film, I want to truthfully convey the emotional journey I went on while making the live show "Tri Am" and the 20 magical years of love between a girl who treasures time and her soulmate from then to now. "Tri Am", yeah! "THE AUDIENCE IS FAMILY. THE STAGE IS HOME." MY TAM Favorite Pop Album, Vol. 9 from My Tam! I apologize for letting you wait so long for my album. For "Tri Am" to happen, Vol. 9 had to happen. It was an album that brought me many wonderful things. With all the strongest feelings between me and the audiences, along with the records achieved, one among them was when Vol. 9 was in the top 10 World Albums from Billboard. I was over the moon. From there, I had the idea of having a concert, singing all the songs in Vol. 9. But things would change and eventually grow into the "Tri Am" live show. I'm in Tokyo. Hi, everyone, it's me. Hello, everyone. I'm My Tam, the lead actress in this film. Let me tell you about the story behind "Tri Am". In late 2020, I was in Japan for a health checkup. Let me think... Oh, just do it. Let me think of a name. My manager told me the sponsors and the team were ready. "Let's have a show." I got so emotional hearing those words. I thought of names for the show that would represent everything the audience and I have been through for 20-plus years. So, I bought a guitar and I wrote the song "Hen Nhau Nam Ay", "See You That Year", here. That helped me to decide on a name, and I then called my team. I told them, "Let's call the show 'Tri Am'." Happy New Year, sis! It's time that I live for myself Maybe I should clarify my situation! So, what's the situation? Go, go! Thank you for the past few months, committing to your tasks, so that everyone is on track. Firstly, we need to talk about the press conference. We should stay quiet and don't tell anyone what we are planning. Make it look like a regular fan meeting. These three songs just make sense! Why? Because I promised I'd come back - and then we'd feel like this is a... - A dream of love. If we come closer, we'll be together. And then, if it's eternal love, no matter how right or wrong it could be or how foolish it is, that love remains forever. "Yesterday and Now" was the very first live show that was hosted in a stadium. It was like meeting your first crush and still loving him. At that time, I thought it would be so hard to have a big show like that. Plus, I didn't know if said crush's love for me would last. But everything came so unexpectedly. It's suddenly become 20 years. So, why is it "Tri Am", "Soulmate"? Only those who love my music, my voice, who keeps me company on this lengthy journey, if they're not soulmates, who then? What did you tattoo on your arm? It's you. - Good heavens! - Is it pretty? Yes. - But did it hurt? - No. It didn't? The pain here could never match that of the heart! I don't get why your hearts would be in pain. Is it because you all love me too much? What's the only thing this girl can do, that she will never change, that she will never turn away? Honestly, my only strength is emotion. If you are really a person with a soul, with feelings, then we can meet up at the same place and time. Besides that, I still live in the now, refreshing my mindset and staying updated. That's why I still have the feelings of a young girl for audiences over 20 years. So they would still find me intriguing. I never changed, but I'm far from the same. A COMEBACK Welcome, everyone, to the world of My Tam's "Tri Am". SOULMATE To me, music is like breathing. I want to bring all of my love, my warmth, my blazing passion, my finest treasures to my audience, all my soulmates. It'll be like a festival where we can celebrate together. MARCH 7, 2021 THE 7TH MILITARY REGION STADIUM MARCH 14, 2021 MY DINH STADIUM But if it's like that for the next part, would I rather feel the last note than vocalize it? At the climax, you just overdo it for me because I can't do it anyway. I cannot do it yet. I have to try! I'm not singing there, so we can dance freely. Why do I sleep better here than in Sài Gòn? I can't breathe! You're going to film me getting dressed? Keep rolling. Let's film me changing clothes. Film it! Bye! Begin! As long as we have something to eat, it'd be OK. My parents love pyramid glutinous rice cakes, so, I have to do it. I'm doing it blindly, but it looks so ugly, my gosh. See how I'm capable but still single? Pastel pink? Let me see. They have these colors. Anything you like, Mom? Do you like this color? Maybe red? The red is too bright. I hate it. Oops, I painted my nails red, so you hate them then? - Do you know who this is? - I don't remember. It's me. Why did I look so cute then? I can't understand why. - Dad, do you remember me then? - Of course I do. I kept many photos in an album. When she was a kid, she sang a lot, even if it was just babbling. Then I saw how passionate she was, so I sent her to the Children's Cultural House. It was like this in the past, standing right here. Like, I swear. Right, standing like this. Peaks, oh peaks, boats, oh boats Clouds, oh clouds, sea oh sea Who would've thought that years later, I'd become a crazy chick in showbiz. Is it cooked? Darling! The rice cakes are done? - As expected. - Is it hot? We have to, next year, make more of them. "Tri Am", the best! Mom, come sit next to Dad. As of 6 p.m., February 10, 2021, the worldwide number of COVID-19 cases are approximately 107,5 million, of which more than 79,5 million have been cured. I honestly can't believe I can do a show at this point. Every day I'd still hope, but I'd also be afraid the team will lose morale and worry about me. So, I didn't want to give in. And I didn't expect that after a month, I would be allowed to do it again. Let it be 17 and 25 for now. Is there an option to change the stadium? Change is a "no". It's the 7th Military Region Stadium. Why the switch? If we still organize the 7th Military Region Stadium, then we just announce a date change. So, you mean we should wait and then ask for permission, to square one? Hi, everyone. Today I'm so excited to announce... Thank you, and see you soon at "Tri Am" live show. When we clap our hands, we will first drop a beat, then we shake the shoulders. Like here... One drop here and then shake. Ready? Three, two, one. "Tri Am"! The atmosphere and everyone's spirit now reminds me of the live show "The Power of Dreams". It's like being in love. So much fire, so much charge! Through that show, I knew that I already connected with my audience. The people who were with Tam will forever remember those beautiful days. Anyone here remembers being at that show? It was so amazing. It's painful, but it must be treated. It's inflamed on both sides. If it gets to this upper area, then that's it. Since the doctor said the injury is severe, I must limit my activity, but I also have to try my best. Usually, when there's a problem, more will tend to follow. I think we have to change the venue, boss. Here, take a look. - Is this the stage? - Yes, it is. What's your opinion? I think it's unreasonable. We didn't have to spend much at the previous location. The floor is of top quality. The floor is made of wood, right? The part we do is wooden flooring. Because it needs to be lifted and moved or... But the important thing is, does it look good? But it will cost a bit more. - It's just money, right? - Just money. Well, that's fine. We can solve it. Let's continue as planned. From the beginning, there were difficulties when the event was planned for the military stadium. The team tried to convince me to do it at Phu Tho Stadium instead. It was my fault since I still wanted to organize it at the 7th Military Region Stadium. Why? Eighteen years ago, I hosted the very first show here. It was "Yesterday and Now". It was that nostalgia that made me want to put on a show there. Nothing else. Entering the stadium is extremely important. It creates a sense of excitement and the energy of the place. I kept thinking whether I had time to change, a different option, or if there wasn't anything else. And it was all here. I had to go for it. Everything is now in God's hands. While we're standing here, we should be grateful for everything that we have. No matter what happens, we will make this place shine bright. "Tri Am"! A WEEK BEFORE THE LIVE SHOW, MY TAM ANNOUNCES LOCATION CHANGE I felt bad with the audience. They said they'll go wherever we go. So adorable! OK, babe, good night. Bye! I practice and work for 12-14 hours a day. The closer the show gets, the more intense my practice gets. I'd like to see whether my fitness can handle it or not. When my spirit and energy are in a good place, it will attract other good things. Let me share why I learned the guzheng. If I love someone, I think that I will be with that person for the rest of my life. We may not get married but I will live with that person forever. While drinking wine, moon gazing in the mountains, etc., an instrument will be needed. One beautiful day, I decided to learn guzheng. I practiced a lot. When I nailed it, that person broke up with me. After an experience of any kind, I am able to compose, usually something sad. I'd use it as material for my music. When I'm in love, I'm just a normal person. I never set a standard what my boyfriend should be like. I just need emotion. It's not easy for me to love someone or forget them. It makes me very tired. When I love someone, I become too dependent on my emotions for that person and I tend to hurt myself. I know myself. When I experience those emotions, I become crazy for the one I love. I was stubborn back then. I didn't want to lose. And the longer I was with someone, the less I respected them. If I don't admit I'm selfish, I'm not honest with myself. I want this, that, and everything. Is that OK? "No!" Why not? "It's because you're already too successful." "Life must be fair, right?" Then, boom, he broke up with me. That's when I realized, "I'm sorry, I was wrong." From that moment, I learned how to respect the other person properly. Three, two, three, four, five, six, seven, pause. Right there. I want everyone to come to the show, not only to hear familiar songs but to hear them as new arrangements or revamped spirits. It can only be heard at the live show. You are simply just a liar! We start with "Dung Cung Thanh Sai", "Right Still Becomes Wrong", first. Maybe Tuan can start again. -When we're still in love -OK. I have just one purpose in the show. It is to admire My Tam's audience and to fully understand why she is loved for so long. When I sing with My Tam on stage, I always keep in mind that it will be the first and the only time. I was in my car at the time. My Tam's manager called, "My Tam wants Wowy to sing in her 'Tri Am' live show." I was like... I was very happy, but I had to keep it cool. Over at Phu Tho Stadium, we had to do everything, the fencing, setting up barriers, rebuilding the stage, laying floors, waterproofing, wrapping the surrounding areas so the audience can have a familiar, intimate feeling and the most wonderful experience. This is me, being sleep-deprived. I didn't sleep enough. Hi, you. Everyone! Wait. We didn't fix it last time, did we? I mean, I've never tried it before. Kimono, and this dress too. I have to dance, stand in the spotlight, and get dressed quickly. We ask for so many things! A musical performance is a combination of song, stage lighting, and the performer's charisma. Hello, everybody. If you don't have enough time, you must have a mic and sing live from the dressing room. If I have time to get dressed, I'll wear more accessories. Oh, everyone! The song "Who is She" is on The Top 10 Billboard Global. I'm trying on this outfit and that article came right up. It seems like it wants me to wear this outfit, Dzung. Here are a few things to note. The first thing is to always be in "silent mode". The second is everyone has their own job. When you're done with your work, you can help each other. You don't interfere with other people's work. Now, I'll run through the flow of the script. - Are you ready? - Pull it out, right? - The skirt! - Two minutes? - Are we done? - One minute 30 seconds. Standby yet? One minute 20 seconds. Three, two, one. We only have three minutes. - 3,5 minutes. - Thirteen seconds. - Strap... - Four minutes yet? OK, is it ready? Go behind my back! No! Start the timer! Two minutes 18 seconds, guys. Hello, my friends. Hey, you. Yeah, yeah. Why A minor? It should be G sharp minor. We've been practicing A minor so far. That's real high. Calm down, please. - It's alright. - But take it slowly, alright? No need to tie this, I'll just hold the frame. I can jump off here faster. OK, we stop here. Stop! I think it's a little crammed here. Not walking on the side. Just up while others go down. That's right. Then we'll move here, that's right, and you sing the first verse. The light... I don't think it's safe to stand there. When will the rain stop? The climax of "Anh Chua Tung Biet", "You've Never Known", it looks the best if you stand here. Now, I want some poses to make a background behind me. Tung, take some steps back. Go two steps to your left. I don't think it looks nice. Let's go back to the old one. One person to the front. You, Thanh. Do we have enough people? Two, three! Please focus, everyone. I know it's been tough on you all. The weather hasn't been nice to us. I hope to have your sympathy. I appreciate you. Thank you so much, everyone. Thanks to those standing far away! Thanks a lot! We need a backup plan for rain now. Did we prepare enough masks? Those trash bins are over there. I have to pick up the nails on the floor and throw it away. Will the artists' rooms be ready by tomorrow? Everything's good? We can call it a day. Thank you so much. Test this bulb for me tomorrow. Let's be neater tomorrow. Today, our dancers couldn't keep up with those songs. I talked to Tam earlier. - This floor temporarily... - What's up? We have to give a little space for them to perform. We have already programmed all the lights. Wait. We have another option. It's OK to move the floor, but I need to know how long it'll take, how to move it, and what it will affect. - You set it up incorrectly yesterday? - Because it was done in 3D. We have to sacrifice everything we've done so far, but now... Don't say that. Actually, designing the floor for this light, I sensed something was wrong. In the meeting, I said you had to leave a small path for me. But do you see? We have to run across the stage. Can anybody convince me? You have a point. OK, let's decide. Can you move it a meter closer for me? It's slightly off, but it's OK. Can I go now? My dear! It wasn't too serious, but everyone's reasoning was sound. I know what to do, but I need to solve the debate, so that this person's happy and that person, too. Can they stand there if it rains? Let's worry about where the audience stands and sits. But it's probably not going to rain. Hopefully not. Today we run through the equipment and the joints. But with this kind of rain, I don't think we can rehearse. Do you know which show this reminds me of? "To The Beat", "Song Da Tan". Thanks to it, I knew that the audience loved me and would be there for me, no matter what. The moment the audience stayed with me, cheered for me in raincoats, it was the feeling from my loved ones that I would never forget. The floor right now is slippery. Be careful, guys. I saw they spread chilies on stage. Sprinkle chilies to wish for rain. - Ouch! I meant sun. - Wish for a sunny day. Thunder right after you said that! No, please, that's not what I meant, goodness. It's raining, but I hope... Today it's not raining. Heaven says it's OK. Let's all agree that at Quynh's part, we'll be slower, more relaxed... A sad story... by Phan Manh Quynh I'm truly delighted and honored. It will be an unforgettable memory in my career and life. We occasionally sing these songs at some home parties. This time, we're bringing them to the stage and magnifying them. Truly, I find that very lovely. I'll pray for good weather. My wedding was the same. It was stormy. One side of the stage broke. Now, you're someone else's husband. The weather wasn't supportive. So, I'm really sorry about it. All the things we noted today, tomorrow morning, please run through them and make more notes. So, once we're done in the afternoon, we can have a dress rehearsal in the evening. Stay healthy, everyone, and we'll continue tomorrow. And try a little bit harder, OK? Today, we have to make sure all the connections are smooth. They're all extremely important, meticulous, and delicate. People come to see me out of love, so I should love them even more to reciprocate their love for me. Stay for the photos? This is the frame that will go down. This is where it goes down, right? We have to run them all. When the audience enters, we have to be super gentle. Let's treat them as family members. Don't push them. In case I go down to this area, the audience will be like this, right? We have to be gentle and polite. Don't push them away, like this. It's unacceptable. It's already intimidating because of the fence. Not to mention we're blocking them, right? They only make mistakes because they don't know. So, don't push them or yell at them. That's something we all should keep in mind. - OK, let's go. - Three, two, one. - Off, lights. All of them, off. - Twenty-seven seconds. - Run LED Matrix. - Why's the lift going down? - Down for what? - Oh, why... Let's assign someone to push it to the back, otherwise, it'll crash into the lift and there will be a mess. Is the moon ready for the next song "Uoc Gi", "I Wish"? - Off visual, off lights. - Ready to lower it down. Lower the stage lift so Tam can step out! Slow down, please! - Stretch it out! - Everyone, stop! Because both sides aren't matching up. I'll only say this. Keep the stage lift down low for me. No need to raise it. I'm not afraid of heights, OK? I'm only worried about how the stage turns out for the "Uoc Gi" song. Stage lift up. Watch out for her dress! Standby "Dau Chi Rieng Em", "Not Only Me". We'll get in at this point to get the purple jacket on. Now, we need five minutes to change into the next outfit. OK, only five minutes to prepare. Hung, you can enter there. Oh, go along? When I get here, you give it to me. No need to... Had a rough day? Everything will be fine. - Oh, there's the moon. - Yeah, the moon is here. Not yet? The more I get stuck, the more down I'd feel. Every day, little by little, and then, nothing can lift me up again. So, I have to sit down and talk about what bothers me. I don't know what to decide. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if what I'm doing is right. Imagine all those things in my head. It's exhausting. If someone feels lost and uncertain, it's extremely tiring. Usually, when I can't do anything else, I'll play the piano and sing. I remember I'd be really sad and then I'd suddenly sing. In the night Only the cries Of my bruised heart are heard THE LIGHT, WALK INTO IT In those times I ask if I'm still understood Only me, my shadow Each stage of life has a different story, and it's not like any other stage in my life. This song is really surprising to me. It makes me feel that in any extreme situation of suffering, there will be a glimmer of light at the end. Cast away this sorrow Stay happy, wait for nothing Happiness awaits under All the raised voices and glowing lights Only the first line... 'Cause I will overcome All the things that sadden me are something only I can understand. No one else will. I have to let go of that expectation. Stop searching for things too extravagant for me. The last song, "Halo", "Hao Quang". Just step into the place where I feel I am loved the most, comfortably and freely. As I know my biggest happiness is when I get to go on stage and sing. If anything happens, the show must go on. Rock the show! Everything that happened before might not have gone my way, but the one that will is definitely when I step onto the stage. Right at that moment, I get to be me. My Tam... "Tri Am"... My Tam... My Tam... "Tri Am"... OK, let me repeat. Wow! Yeah! My Tam... I just got here and have goosebumps already. "Tri Am"! We always appreciate what we have today. Many thanks for your support, OK? We'll rock it! Stay fired up! Keep pushing! This is our time. We give our thanks to Heaven, to the Almighty. Thank the deities for giving us a chance to stand here, to make the weather nice enough for us to perform, right? And we will rock the show! The audience is our family, the stage is our home. We'll have a performance with excellent, powerful emotions. Everyone has their own special talents. We will show them to the audience tonight. So they will know how much we treasure them, OK? "Tri Am", yeah! My Tam... ...nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Life as students, we have our guitars Whose tunes carry our voices far His, to where home is Hers, to where dad is Let's all sing along! College days, all worth cherishing When you feel down I'll pluck these strings I miss us, miss us so much As I miss I hold my Guitar Nightingale, who sings in the night Nightingale with auburn coat, that is me Nightingale, who sings among clouds Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Nightingale, who sings in the night Nightingale with auburn coat, that is me Nightingale, who sings among clouds Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Nightingale, who sings in the night Nightingale with auburn coat, that is me Nightingale, who sings among clouds Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Nightingale, who sings in the night Nightingale with auburn coat, that is me Nightingale, who sings among clouds Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Thank you, all. All my soulmates. There are many faces that I've seen before. There are also a lot of new faces. Let's all see this as our home. So, what are you to me? My family members. Since we're at home, I can take off my jacket, right? Because I'm getting hot. This is a dream I think I will never forget. Every time I stand on this stage, I feel that this is where I belong. And what I would like to do right now is to let all of you know I love all my soulmates so much. I wish my words had been calm I wish we could stem our rage Since I'm now all on my own I have lost you, my mate I wish time could travel back I wish to meet one more time So I could say I miss you And I have only you You're always in my sights Yet I will act like I don't I would like to see how far Your act takes you Don't keep waiting for my trust Please stop saying you love me Since I know those words Are not just for me Don't keep waiting for my trust Please stop saying you love me Since I know those words Are not just for me I intended to wear this to play the guzheng at first. Much prettier and cooler, right? Something like that. Playing it requires gentleness, you know? But gentle, that I'm not! I'm just like that. So what? If you leave My heart will ache plenty Even though within I still feel love for you If you go Then allow me to say this line to you That although we are apart If you leave My heart will ache plenty Even though within I still feel love for you If you go Then allow me to say this line to you That although we are apart I still love you If they always get upset And find a way to bring things down If the love has gotten old Why be shocked when they turn around And to us, they are the world But people, they rarely think Once out of love Right still becomes wrong And to us, they are the world But Tuan here rarely thinks that And yet Tam always thinks that And to us, they are the world But people they rarely think Once out of love Right still becomes Wrong Hosting this show has been really tough. I thought it would never happen. So many things happened that wore me down so much. There will always be tough times in life, right, folks? I think that stepping out here is the rightest thing I've ever done in my life. And I feel all of your love and affection. If it wasn't for you, then I wouldn't be here. And if everything I did had no heart, none of you would be here. And I also think that no matter how sad, desperate, or exhausted I am, I still have to think about those who love me. -So, I shall step out and smile, -I love you! to return my love for them. Am I right? I love you so much! In the night Only the crying Of my pained heart is heard In those times I ask if I'm still understood Only me, my shadow Comes a point I ask if there's someone Who still loves me Searching for a precious thing When life feels cold Forget it all It's only me But life is not just filled With the sweetest reveries And I've learned to let go Of sorrows from before Enough I must forget my blues With a fragile heart I'll no longer be broken Let's step out to a place Where we feel loved and freed Even if this heart breaks, I'll still be happy, smiling Before you Cast away this sorrow Stay happy, wait for nothing Happiness awaits under All the raised voices and glowing lights Let's step out to a place Where we feel loved and free Even if this heart breaks I'll still be happy, smiling Before you Cast away this sorrow Stay happy, wait for nothing Happiness awaits under All the raised voices and glowing lights My Tam... Cause I will overcome! You are my youth. My music is your youth. Is this from my fan club? May your most beautiful dreams be with those balloons. I hope they'll come true. Can't believe I'm still Awaiting your return Despite all of the storms That have been in our love Can't believe I'm still missing you Despite telling myself That I should just stop I can't believe it I can't believe it Can't believe I'm still missing you Thank you, everybody. Thank you, everyone on this side. This side. Thanks, everyone! Eighteen years ago, I hosted a show in a way that I had to prove myself to others. The way that an artist has to have their own show. But then, the more I did it, the more I realized a live show is a way to express my emotions, the current point of my music career. And as I got older and gained more stage presence, I'd lean towards different emotions and inspirations. Please say love to me Today is amazing! I screamed a lot. My throat's sore! I flew in from Phu Quoc. I'll fly back to the island 5 a.m. tomorrow. We flew in from Ha Noi. When my auntie felt tired, she sat down. When My Tam appeared, she stood up again and rocked the house with My Tam. My family is really proud of her and everything. Hey, y'all! Good night! Sleep tight! I love My Tam so much! We are in Tam's neighborhood in Da Nang. Congrats, My Tam! Such a successful show! See you again in Ha Noi on May 1. I arrived here at dawn. I came straight here after landing. With all my passion, Because I love you so! Dearest Mom! So, are you happy? Are you happy? So lucky it didn't rain, right, Dad? Heaven blessed you! The ancestors, too! Pouring or not, it's God's will. He said My Tam is really lucky, well-treated by deities. - Heaven-blessed indeed! - Indeed! Best! My Tam, best of the best! Tri Am's the best! - This is your youngest daughter. - Right, it's mine. - Lovely, lovely! - Saved it. The show in Ha Noi may have to be canceled. When Ha Noi was no more, I was so down and felt depressed. I would have constant talks, sunrise to sunset, to decide whether to postpone or not. At this time, the construction was 70% done, but everything had to be cleared out. I did ask. The authorities didn't restrict us or anything, but the problem is they don't recommend us a course of action. This sucks. Hey, I've called everywhere, but I think we have to cancel the Ha Noi show. The first thing I'm afraid of is that if I can't ensure everyone's safety, then I would make the gravest mistake. So, even with another person's guarantee, if I feel that I can't wholly control everything, then I shouldn't go ahead. As for returning the tickets, that I must do. But to go and return them, that's up to the crowd. I feel so troubled. But the audience was understanding and kept their tickets. This reminded me of their love for me. I owe my audience another big favor. So, I must do even better now. Wow, it smells good! So heavy! My goodness! When I have free time, I find something to do, just like everybody else. I can do anything, but what I do best is showing off. When I have even more time, I do gardening. Like trimming, pruning branches. As for cooking, you already know. Looks professional, doesn't it? Good remarks, I'll take them. Average ones, I won't argue. We must make sure it's secured. Now, this is the scary part. Just look and all is revealed. Such sincerity! I do live for the gram. I sort of know embroidery. This, I made in Japan when I first decided to host the "Tri Am" show. A picture of a couple under a tree. I also tried to learn how to sew and all. Got all that Confucian "work, beauty, diction, grace". I heard that doing this helps calm you down. Not sure about that. Shoot! Shackle! Oh no! I got the wrong one. Press this key. Not healing your peers, why? Well, I'm screwed. That's a day in my life. I stand and then sit and then do the reverse. Then I practice dancing. Throughout the pandemic, I practiced every day. See how slim I've become? After the pandemic, everyone got back to their normal routine. But I didn't think everything was under control yet, so I thought of doing a virtual show. Squid Game? - Squid Game. - Squid Game. That would be scary. If life is just a dream Then don't let me wake up! MY TAM HOLDS HER FIRST ONLINE CONCERT "MY SOUL 1981" If I didn't have any activities, I would easily be discouraged. Thanks to online events, I get to be closer to my audience and better understand their feelings. At that moment, I realized, "Ah! The crowd's heart was still beside me." Can't be discouraged, then. All those things came to me so perfectly. I got many hit songs and other things. Everything that came to me were all unexpected. I understood many things. I see my life, my music, my career are exactly like all the songs I've performed. "When I was 20, I rushed into life." It was exactly like that. It's in all the events. Like a date, like a dream. There are moments that will come to us and then never leave. My Da Lat concert was hit with a blackout, but that allowed the audience and I to become one. It reminded me of the live show "Heartbeat". I knew right then that the audience and I belonged together. I wish my words had been calm I wish we could stem our rage Since I'm now all on my own I have lost you, my mate I wish time could travel back I wish to meet one more time So I could say I miss you And I have only Only Tam! Months and months I've waited for this paperwork! Welcome, everybody, to the "Tri Am" show. The biggest live show in Vietnam, on a never-before-seen scale. The need to suspend the Ha Noi show was a design from the Almighty. Accompanying anything bad that would happen to me is the goodness that would compensate. I had time to contemplate, prepare for something bigger, and learn from everything. The conditions, emotions of the audience from everywhere have converged. I realized that for everything that I'd lose I would gain so much more. How about an alley for the cart... Before going to the stadium in Ha Noi, I knew that it'd be really spacious, large. And the scale of this show was bigger than Sài Gòn's. Therefore, I thought I had to do something to be closer to the audience. - So, the cart will go from here? - It goes behind. I got it. I think in order to be on time, I'll sing that part here, right out here. Then I'll go down here. At that point, you can turn off everything here. Turn around. Boom! 00:24 and we then lift. Welcoming my soulmates to My Dinh Stadium on November 5. Yeah, yeah! After more than 1,5 years and two postponements, The "Tri Am" live show at Ha Noi's My Dinh Stadium will be a combo of light, music, and a lively atmosphere. The event has attracted over thousands of people. The success of the first "Tri Am" live show in Ho Chi Minh City's Phu Tho Stadium has helped My Tam score a new milestone in her music career. This makes the second night of "Tri Am" in Hanoi one of the most anticipated music events at the year's end. When I mention the word "Tri Am", I get really emotional. It's a reunion between the people and the songs that have accompanied me for 20 years, and it brings back a lot of memories. Of course, there will be exciting surprises during the show as well. I will keep on practicing and find ways to raise the bar of my show to create a truly explosive experience for the audience. Two, three, four. One, two, three. Seems to be wrong. Then you give it to me. Afterward, the mic to me. Throw it away. Next to each other. See, a little hiccup there. - Hello! - Hello, everyone. Who are you? What's this song? New show recalls old show Oh, right. I'll catch the tone, then sing. I got it. Then, let the audience sing Then go into interlude And then we are done It's just like that Oh, it's like that When I was 20 I rushed into life We will start over, from the top. If a song we rehearse is not good, we'll continue until it's perfect. It greets me And on my hands Roses Welcome, all of you, to "Tri Am". Yeah, babe, I love you forever Love you for a lifetime Our love will last a long time You'll be the sun by my side The breeze that stays soothing We'll be side by side On all the roads going home Ga's sitting is on the side If Ga's sitting is on the side How could my family and friends sit down? Did you forget That you asked Tram for tickets? But my friends' demands Have just increased So, then, I'll be On my own way I understand myself most on my career path. And I learned that if all these things were about and for me but I had no idea what they were, then all my plans would not turn out well. Therefore, everything, even the smallest, I must know about it. Because all the work, from sounds, lights, electricity, the grass, field, trash, or anything else, people will only know one person behind it. Me, My Tam. And if anything happens, my name will come up. They can't do that to anyone else. And so, I have to know everything so that I know how to take responsibility. The thing about sounds and lights was dealt with already. But they changed their minds at the last minute. To me, I don't work with folks with two tongues. I was OK with the higher costs. But then we found out we were short-staffed. We also have risks. If it's about money, I'm willing to pay, no problem. And we're renting, not borrowing. I'll start over with a new coordinator. So, can everyone, including Huan and Huy, do it? I'm down for whatever. No need to fear anything. We have good people, why be fearful? - If Tam doesn't mind, let's do it. - OK, let's continue. We divide this floor into halves. OK? Let keep this area of the floor untouched. Dancers won't be here, so it won't get dirty. Take this off. This. This. Relay the entire stage to look nice for the performance, done. I hope that we all give our best. I know everyone is top-tier, but we should avoid mistakes whenever possible. Because I'm responsible for everything. Although you know names, you can't just, "Cong did this for sure. It can't be anyone else." Nobody can say that. The biggest hope is that we'll have a show that's spectacular regarding sound, lights, audience, and everything else. Let's make some noise! Usually, when it gets closer to the big day, problems will arise. - Were you tired? - Of course, I was. Indeed, right? But the fatigue wouldn't show right then. In the evening, I think to myself, "Why did I say that at that moment?" If I sorted out all the things that happened during the day, then I'd be able to go to sleep. I just came here from the dance studio. - Still raining outside? - Still! We waited until it got lighter but got wet anyway. Part it into fours, Chau. Don't flatten it too much. Make it a little lower. Too late, too tired. Let's roll! Regarding costume changes, I want to surprise and overwhelm the audience. What made things harder was that I had to change every two songs, or maybe even one. This fit is really complicated. The leather set comes before the gold silk set. Just try! Why can't we do it? I have to think harder to figure out how to change so that, at any point, the audience wouldn't have to wait for me. On the fitting day, I felt quite weak. I knew I was unwell, but I still tried to run through everything and lift up my mood. I kept telling myself, "Do not get sick!" Don't play the lyrics on the big screen. Play it on my monitor so I can read them. It's not, "Don't play anything". I'm touched! So touched! After this show, our youth might still last for 5 years, 10 or more, who knows? May you all be healthy and joyful and we all have a successful night. One, two, three. "Tri Am", best... Hello, dearest Ha Noi. I'm here. Adjust the spotlight, please. Concentrate. I'm lucky when I have lots of support from individuals and groups. They all stand by my side, supporting me quietly. Then music volume down. Slowly, slowly. Until it's silent, then... Success is a shared notion. Because I could never do it on my own, without my team. I feel that I'm pretty lucky. You must be someone who thinks about others to get support from others. "Tri Am", the best! There are times I'd feel sad, hopeless, stressed, falling into a very bad state. My soulmates might not know about that, moments where I'd be in pain, in suffering. And usually, only when it's passed would I tell friends and all. It's only today that I can tell you, in fact, a year ago, I was so exhausted. I was depressed and aimless. I was sad, crying, and couldn't sleep. I had to take pills to sleep. The day after the fitting, I had a fever. I had a swollen throat, inflammation, and everything. I was devastated. I tried everything to get better, taking medicines, injections, as I needed to keep myself in my best possible form. Nightingale with fleeting smile That is me Now, let's try! Even though I got better, some ripples remained, like at the time, I'd still cough lightly. - This had me very scared. - OK! Ha Noi in Fall, Fall in Ha Noi Milkwoods in bloom, fusing the breeze Green rice returns, freshen the hands Sidewalk milked rice Scenting your steps Ho Tay in Fall Waters and shores, so inviting Its mist yearning The birds that fly to the sun For the "Tri Am" live show in Ha Noi, I was sleepless for many days. It was perhaps because of the pressure, but when I came to the stadium and saw everything, I felt, "This was my sanctuary." I had to bring the most wonderful experience to my crowd and not let them down. Let's light up Ha Noi, light up "Tri Am", and make it a night for the history books. After 18 years, walking out onto a stage like that, all the memories, emotions, came flooding back. The crowd would roar when they saw me entering from the back. I truly felt overwhelmed. I could still meet them and host a show for them. This was the biggest joy. A really emotional thing. Some speakers can thrill without moving their lips. Some wines intoxicate without taking a sip. And some tunes can stir without needing to sing. Such is the magic of music, youth, and time. Ready? Today is a very special day. If we already did this once, we will soon do even better. We have nothing to lose. We will only gain. And when the audience is waiting for us like that, we're even more committed to put on an explosive show. Whatever we have today, we'll give it our all. Perform with all our hearts to make the audience feel proud for coming to our show. And I thank the Almighty and everyone for coming to me and creating this show with me. Thank you, everyone. Love you all! "Tri Am", forever best! It's a pinnacle. Every time I hold an event, it's an emotional pinnacle. I will make my audience proud, make my soulmates happy. I will make them feel worthy of being here. Ha Noi in Fall Yellowed celtis Reddened almond Stand side by side On olden streets With dark-tiled homes Ha Noi in Fall, Fall in Ha Noi Milkwoods in bloom, fusing the breeze Green rice returns, freshen the hands Street-side milked rice Scenting your steps Ha Noi in Fall Fall in Ha Noi To recall one Is to Miss all You see me as your youth. But clearly, what's happening now is my youth. The audience is afraid that this girl will no longer be on stage. But I will always feel... I have embraced my audience for many decades. When I was 20 I rushed into life Life at 20 So green It greets me Tam shines bright among fans Yeah, babe, I love you forever Love you for a lifetime Our love will last a long time You'll be the sun by my side The breeze that stays soothing We'll be side by side On all the roads leading home Yeah, babe, I love you forever Love you for a lifetime Our love will last a long time You'll be the sun by my side The breeze that stays soothing We'll be side by side On all the roads leading home Ha Noi, hey! I wish time could travel back I wish to meet one more time So I could say I miss you And I have only My fans There are things that once lost are gone for good, but it's not the case with time at this "Tri Am" show! We can retrieve all the time that we had, all of our youth here. Do you agree? First love leaves behind lasting echoes So, if we're truly bound, Tam will return And you will see flowers fall like rain Enlivening the streets But it seems that I still cannot return And you stay in an age Where youth can't burn Time flows just like a shooting star In those glimpses of us The years outside of love I need you near Life is short for such lengthy yearnings And we're old enough to wish for youth Of yesterday Who was here 18 years ago? The girl from 18 years ago is still the same one 18 years later. This is my promise to all of you. Those who are here throughout the years, You ask me who I am. I think I'm the chosen one to preserve the emotions and time for my soulmates. Do you know what today is in the lunar calendar? It's the 12th day. It's normal, nothing special. What's abnormal, though? Do you know what it is? The moon is out! They said the right kind of love is one that goes "to the moon and back". Do you agree? When I woke up, I saw the sun Coming through the window pane And it was beautiful The tree branches gently swayed Behind canopies where the birds stay And it was beautiful The dancing flower Made everything magic No rain to fear Umbrella tells me Now that I have seen All the fire of your love Want to say I love you To the moon and back Lift your hands up with me Hold me like waves that meet the sea Now that I have seen All the fire of your love Want to say I love you To the moon and back "Tri am", "Soulmate", to me, is someone who understands my music, my voice, my sounds, and my great love for you all. Or should we vow when it's surreal To find a time to meet, to feel You and I, we share the same path And our love, Heaven does know The rain right outside It's like tears without words That love will always be the clouds in a dream Let us part then For love is gone Here I turn as the tears Overflow my eyes I will embrace the audience's dream and realize it instead of doing so for my own. Today, I'm really honored to have Hung and Quynh to share the stage and sing with me. I also want us to dedicate this song to a late friend. Director Huynh Phuc Dien. When I'm really down I sure miss you, dear Longing for your words That will bring me peace I call out for you, but where are you now? Each hour goes by With me worried and wondering Were you sad because of me? My friend! I love you, soulmate I love you, too, soulmate I love you two, too, soulmate At that place At that place Folks usually play soccer - What is this, Quynh? - And today We play the show called Tri Am I lack a bit of the awkwardness For us to be lovers I lack a bit of the passion For us to promise things Don't hold onto this part Don't regret so much The trust has long shattered Better to let go Rather than being in more pain Than have your eyes catch rain The enduring last words Come at our big stop I'm truly sorry I'm truly sorry, my love So nice to meet you Even if it's clueless where we will go Just a gentle word between us both Before things get to start So nice to meet you My heart misses you always, it seems It was a love that had me lingering Alone I stand on this empty street With shattered hopes and dreams Let's treat it like my story Has not yet started To ease the sorrow from my soul Like petals that have stopped fading We keep them To keep us There's no literal "grandest stage". The greatest stage is where I stand in the right position with sincere emotions and is then warmly welcomed by the audience. Up above are all sorts of lights Green, red, purple, and golden All pop and shine Down below are my firm two feet Fit for this glorious moment Making it last Look at me Do you see me as distinctive? Look at me Do you see my confidence? Since there's no reason For me to be afraid No limit to apply the brakes Can you see me radiate? Can you see me piercing time? Can you see me all ablaze Just burning bright? Can you see me all aglow with my halo? Can you see me radiate? Can you see me piercing time? Can you see me all ablaze Just burning bright? Can you see me all aglow with my halo? Halo, halo, halo, halo! Halo! How are my soulmates feeling? In an impulsive moment, I thought I was so lonely. But I was wrong. Terribly wrong. I was wrong because I thought I was like that. But in reality, I have 30,000 people over there. Around here. Love you! This is not a lament but a confession, me being myself the most when I'm alone. And I recalled everything I had from zero until now. Zero, nothing. Everything I have right now is yours. It belongs to my audience. I thought that the place I was standing could blend everything together. Only sanctuaries can do that. Let's step out to a place Where we feel loved and free Even if this heart breaks I'll still be happy, smiling Before you Cast away this sorrow I'm just, in fact, a normal person who lives, loves, hates, is angry, unforgiving, selfish, ambitious. The only thing that makes me who I am is that I'm self-aware because I grew up in the audience's embrace. They want to see me on stage, and I want to see my audience love and embrace each other as one. My love, please Come back to me here Warm yourself in my old embrace And our love It never has Gone far I can see my family. Thanks, Mom and Dad, for creating me. Thanks to my soulmates for being in my life. Thanks to my amazing team. I love you all! I know love can be a cage But I'll turn my heart over for you whole Even if one day your love for me ceases And mine stays the same I know love can be a cage But I'll give away all my heart for good It's the one thing That will make our love eternal PLEASE FORGET ME Forget me And stop loving me If there's nothing else behind Please just forget me I feel so lucky and happy with what I have. It'll never be enough to express my gratitude, my appreciation for all that happened. Love is like the wind that blows by Please just forget me. It's been more than 20 years, but my soulmates and I are still here, together. Honestly, I can't hold back my feelings. Everything that is happening now is a miracle. It's like a dream. If all of life is just a dream It would be the prettiest ever If all of life is just a dream Then please don't wake me up Let me always keep you in my arms Give you a kiss full of love and grace For all of life is just a dream If you're always close by As one journey closes, another begins, with wonderful emotions and experiences soon on the way. Thanks to my soulmates for being with me on this journey. I will cherish these beautiful moments forever. And may I be the keeper of your time? Whenever you need me or miss me, come see me and my music to turn things back. And we will definitely have a date, a place to meet, to see each other. It will be like a dream. It will always be the most beautiful one ever. "Tri Am", forever best!
