All the customers with passport examination... there will be transport available direct to London terminal. Thank you. I have no passport. I see, I expect you'd like to see the airport's security officer. Yes, thank you, I know the way. Hello Mac. Good Morning sir, I'll tell Mr. Chubb you're here. Good. Mr. Somers is here sir. Yes sir. - Oh yes, he'll see you now sir. - Thank you Mac. Well, you managed to get out? - Only just. - So I heard. - You used the emergency route, why? - I had too, the frontier was blocked. - Besides I had a bit of trouble. - Hurt? No, I've got a rib strap up but it'll be all right. Same old room, nothing changes. But people do. They get older. Of course there are some jobs where it doesn't matter. My job, for instance. Not mine. How was I to know that Mark Bamm was going to change his mind halfway? There was a time when you'd sensed it and brought Bamm safely back. - Anyway I got Mark Bamm in the end. - You were responsible from then. I know I was. I'm very sorry. Let's see, you joined us in 1939. In 1940, parachuted into Bavaria. Captured by Gestapo, interrogated. Escaped with Professor Jacob Werner. 43, Paris. Liaison Darrieux. Returned Germany and escaped with Professor Karl Cesare and wife. From 44 to 45, in charge of contra espionage UK Northern Area. Headquarters, Liverpool Hamburg, details of mine defenses. Yes. Yes. Yes, quite a good record, until now. - Aren't I allowed one mistake? - No. I see. - What would happens now? - The way you came in. You are not a regular, you had to go sooner or later anyway. I used to be a newspaper man once. You think there be any future in the real life story of the secret service? I should think of a very short future Major Somers. Very short. You got a little money, haven't you? Well, then forget all this, go back to real life again. Real? - And how do I start? - Well, to begin with, stop carrying a gun. You're going to miss me, you know. I am one of the best men you got. Had is the operative word old boy. You ought to something think about a jump for yourself. Something quiet, in the country. I might be able to help you. - So that you can keep tabs on me. - Something like that, yeah. There'll be decoration for you, of course, you wouldn't mind that. What for, missing Bamm? - No, for the time you didn't miss. - Oh, very touching. Oh, that's sad. Good bye sir. Good bye David and thanks. Get Mr.Shepley. Hello Shepley, remember what I tell you about Somers? No, he's just left. - Same for me. - Thank you. - Oh, my dear fellow. - Back again, eh? Marvelous life. Always fancy myself as a newspaper man. If only didn't get so tired. What do you do for a living Willy? Oh, nothing old boy. I never found anything to suit me, pity. That's what my old man's thinks. - How's the pen pushing? - Rotten, I'm looking for a job. Terrible life, isn't it? Cheers. So apart from your languages and this newspaper work that you did once... you have no qualifications at all Major Somers. Mr. Somers. So sorry, some officers like to retain the... Yes, yes I know. Well, we must see what we have for you. I suppose you haven't a working knowledge of commercial Portuguese? No, no, I'm afraid I haven't. Well, there's is one here, I don't miss recommend it, I just mentioned in passing. Why is it dangerous? Oh not at all, no, not exactly. I, I think I should tell you we had greatest... difficulties in even getting people to consider it. What is the job? Cataloging butterflies. - Do I have to know anything about them? - Well, no. No, the only necessary qualifications seems to be a... sound general education and an amiable disposition. - You appear to have both if I may say so. - Yes sir, thank you. But I think I must point out that, in our opinion there is very little future in it. Butterflies. Well, I could think about it, I suppose. Yes, I'm afraid that's what they all say. - Hello Willy, have a drink? - Hello old boy, thanks. - How's the job hunting? - Fine, all fixed up, I'm celebrating. - Good. - What you'll have? - Scotch. - Two whiskeys please. Hello? Chubb? Shepley here. Well, he's fixed up. Yes, all Ok. Nice quiet family, nice quiet place. Cataloging butterflies. - I'm looking for a house call White Lodge. - Oh yes, I know. - You know it? - Yeah, I know it. Well, you mind telling me how to get there? I'll do better that that, I'll show you, I'm going there myself. Well, that's jolly decent of you. - You know the Fentons? - No, and you? Yeah, in a manner of speaking. - What manner would that be? - You'd better ask the Fentons. Everyone knows me around here. Well, that'll be your personality of course. Are you the chap that come and help with the butterflies? That's right. Nice part of the country this. Stick to the butterflies. Codius Croceus, Clouded yellow. Where's Sophie? Oh Jess, the light, you're blocking the light. Oh Nicholas, do stop for a minute and listen to me. I always listen to you my dear, I can do almost anything and at the same time... - and still listen to you. - Nicholas, I'm serious. - Oh Jess, let's have peace. - Where is Sophie? Over in the far meadow trying to find clouded yellows. - Why? - Well, this man who is coming, this Somers. He must be warn about her. I'm afraid my dear, that's a little unnecessary, what should he be warn about? After all he's just a young man who's coming to stay with us and do a little work. - You know Sophie just as well as I do. - But I really don't see what could happen. A local young man I can deal with but this is something quite different. Somebody here living in the house. Oh, no don't let's start of imagining things. I don't like a stranger here talking to Sophie, asking her questions. You'd no business to arrange without consulting me. Well, I'm sorry, my dear but it's done now. I'm David Somers. Makes a nice change to come round to the front door, I've... brought you a couple of rabbits for you Mrs.Fenton. - Take them around to the back, will you. - Anything you say Mrs Fenton. - How do you do. - How do you do I'm so pleased to meet you, I think my husband is here. - Oh, Nicholas, this is Mr. Somers. - - How you do sir. How are you? I see you've done making friends already. Hick is quite well known round here, isn't he dear? - I'll tell Addie to bring your bags. - Thank you. - I'll show you where to put your car. - Thank you sir. Come in. - Hello sir. - Our Addie has brought up your bags I see. Please go on. Usually she has to be told things twice, You must've made an impression on her. By the way, there is a bigger room at the back of the house if you prefer it, but... This is the one that had a view of the garden. - Oh no, this is perfect, thank you sir. - Good. Well, I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm sure I shall. If you don't mind my saying so... you hardly seem to be the sort of man that would, well... - Want to catalogue butterflies? - Well yes. Of course you made it quite clear in your letter that you were not interested in the butterflies as such but... I can't help wondering what attracted you to the job. Your references were really excellent. But they did make it clear to you that it was only temporary, did they? Oh yes, they did sir. Well, it's simply that I got rather tired of people and cities and... Well, the thought of two or three months doing something... quiet and peaceful in the country seemed to me just what I wanted. Oh yes, I understand. A convalescence of the mind. Peace, that's what we all strive for, don't we? I well understand. - I hope you'd be happy. - Thank you sir. We're, we are very quiet here there is just my wife and myself and my wife's niece. I, I feel perhaps I ought to tell you something about Sophie. - Your wife's niece? - Yes, we're her guardians. She's not had a very happy life and may find her a little... strange in certain respects. Well I, I thought I just tell you that... she's a sweet child but she is very highly strung and she isn't always quiet... reasonable in the things she says. Jess, my wife, understands her. Now, please don't think too much about it but I thought I let you know. - I'll remember sir. - Well, that's that. Tea will be a little late today, my wife always go down... Tapgrove on Tuesdays and Fridays so it will be five o'clock instead of half past four. Well, I'll leave you to it. If there is anything you want you will ring, won't you? Yes thank you I can't promise that Addie will answer the bell but it's always worth trying. - Five o'clock downstairs, I'll see you then. - Fine thank you sir I'm sorry. I'm very sorry, I thought you gone down to the village. I don't. - Who are you? - My name is Somers, David Somers. Are you the one is going to do the butterflies for Nicholas? That's right, you must be Mrs. Fenton's niece. - Yes. - How you do? How you do? You play very well Miss Sophie. Do I? Jess hates me to play. - I thought you were Jess when you came in. - I see. - Are you a doctor? - No, I'm not a doctor. And you haven't come here to explain to me that I get things muddled and wrong. No, no, I come help with the butterflies. - That's what Jess said. - But it's true. There was a doctor who came here once before. Yes? - You think I'm very foolish, don't you? - Oh, no, I don't. They, they asked me down to tea, can you tell me where they have it? - On the terrace. - Thank you. I'm sorry I disturbed your playing. - Jess is back, so I couldn't go on anyway. - What a pity. Mr. Somers... you won't tell Jess what I said to you, will you? No, no, I won't. - Good Morning sir. - Good Morning Addie. Good Morning. You know, here is the list of my collection, you see how it goes. It's in alphabetical order. It tallies with the butterflies in these trays and with those over there. And here are the reference books. I'll just muddle through this morning. That's right, see how you get on, and by the way... when you push these trays in again will you do it very gently? If they jar too much it harms the specimens - I'll be careful. - Good. And if you want me I shall be just outside in the garden. Right sir, thank you. I told you not to come to this part of the house. I don't mind which part of the house I come to. - Why can't I still come to you? - Because I like it better here. I like the view. - Get out of here before I call my husband. - You should've called him a long time ago. - If you were to call him at all. - Oh Jim, sorry, I didn't mean to say that. I didn't really, please. Please. - Got any honey to spare? - What are you doing here? Ah, don't be so high and mighty. Why don't you relax a bit? Don't you like me? - All the other girls do. - You've no right to be here, go away. That's not very friendly. Give me my comb. - Say please. - Please. No, not friendly enough. Well, I can't get any honey and I can't get friendly so... I'll keep this. Hick. Hick. - It's anything matter? - He's taken my comb. - Is he a friend of yours too? - I don't know. - He does stupid things. - What Hick is been up to? Oh, nothing. Well, I'll, I'll get back to my butterflies. - I should avoid Hick if I were you child. - I do. - How long is Mr. Somers going to stay here? - A month or two. I like him. - I shouldn't say so, not to your aunt. - Oh, I wouldn't, not to Jess. I must get another comb. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, I forgot. - Forgot? You do it purposely. - No I don't. - Don't you lie to me. Oh Mr. Somers, I didn't see you standing there I'm really very sorry. Sophie, please go. I expect you think I'm very unkind to Sophie. - Well, it's none of my business Mrs. Fenton. - But you must be thinking it. That was her father's music she was playing. - Her father's? - Was George Malraux, the composer. Malraux? Didn't he shoot himself and his wife? She was my sister. The marriage was hopeless from the start. But why the suicide? He was unbalanced. He needed someone strong, who could understand him. Sophie was only six when it happened. Was dreadful, you see, she found them. When Nicholas and I arrived... She was kneeling by her mother, she bent over her. - Was blood on her hair. - How dreadful. Mr. Somers, I have to tell you this. Sophie is like her father and it is very bad for her to be reminded of the past. We have to watch her, she get things twisted and wrong, it can be dangerous.. - She's right, I do get things muddled. - We all get muddled sometimes. Good Morning. Good Morning. - I'm happy to see you Sophie. - Why? - I have an apology to make to you. - You mean about last night? - It wasn't your fault. - No. You once tell me that your Aunt wouldn't let you play the piano and I didn't believe you. I'm sorry. - You are very kind Mr Somers. - No, no, it's not that. It's just that I suddenly realized how very lonely you must be. You never go out, nobody ever comes here. Except Hick. Oh yes, but you haven't really got any friends, have you? No. Or relatives apart from Mr. and Mrs. Fenton? When you've always been alone you get used to it. Oh, is that quite true? No, it isn't. It's nearly true. You wouldn't know. I know what it's like to be alone. - And I know what despair can feel like too. - Do you? Even the sun looks gray. And self pity is such a dreary thing you despise yourself... and wonders if it matters if you go on living or not. Yes I know. - Sophie, would you let me help you? - Help me? - Now I've got you. - No, I can shut you out Sophie. - Sophie, where are you? - It's your move Sophie. That's the idea. Yes, you're really doing a very good job, far more quickly than I could. It's a practical mind. Know, I started a catalogue three times but... always when I come to one of my old favorites I stopped and think how I caught it. - Yeah I know, and then you're lost. - How well you understand. Know, you've become a quite stabilizing influence during the weeks you've been here. I shall be very sorry when you have to leave us. Well, I shall be very sorry too sir, I've been very happy here. I'm glad. Got it. - Silver washed, see them all over the place. - All right, fly away. - Don't you ever get tired of butterflies? - I get tired of people first. Well of course. But I've only had three weeks with butterflies. What do you do when you get tired of people? You can't stick pins through their middles. - Think sometimes I'd like to. - Yes, I know that feeling. - What was that? - What? I thought I heard something cry out. Yes, there it's again. Why did you do that? It was caught in one of these beastly spring traps, its legs were broken. - Poor little thing. - I hate traps. Hey, what do you think you're playing at? What are you doing with that rabbit? - How many of those traps have you got? - About a dozen. - You happy with that sort? - I bought them cheap. - Any objections? - I'll give five pounds for the lot. - Well, that suits me fine. - And I'll take delivery now. Say, I can't bring them now, I'm meeting someone - I said now. - You'd better get them Hick. Five pounds is certainly better than any girl. Maybe you got something there, I'll bring them round. Oh Hick... could I have my comb? I'll throw it in with the traps. He spoiled it. I don't want it anymore. A nice chap. He's one of the people I'd like to throw away I'd stick to butterflies if I were you. - You see, his work? - Well, he brought her back. - It's bad for her. - Nonsense. There you are Sophie. - Any luck? - No, only silver washed. I told Hick not to come here. I have some work to do. I'm afraid it's my fault Mrs Fenton, I've just bought some rabbit traps from Hick. - Oh, right. - He's sorry for the rabbits. - What you doing with my knife? - I'll give it back to you later on. - Well, I'll better go and collect the traps. - Mind you only give him five pounds. I will. - Oh Mr. Somers. - Yes. He'll try make you give him more, I know Hick. So do I. - More tea Sophie? - But I hadn't had any... You really must remember what you do Sophie, you really must. - I better go upstairs and change. - There is no one to impress here. Have you been with Mr Somers all the afternoon? - Yes, he likes being with me. - That's because he's kind. You mustn't take advantage of it Sophie. - It's nice to have a friend. - But not for you, it's not safe. Your father loved your mother and you are very like him. I don't mind, I want to be like him. Oh, Mrs. Fenton. Hick asked me to give you this, he said it was his bill. Oh Thank you, thank you Mr. Somers. - Mr. Fenton, Mr. Fenton. - What's it Addie? - It's Hick, he's dead. - What? Down by the stables. There's a knife in his back, it's horrible I saw him lying there, I saw the knife, who could've done it? You must've been seeing things, Somers go with her, like a good fellow, will you? - See what this is all about. - I'll put on a coat. He's dead all right. - You'd better send for the police Somers. - Yes sir. - Come back into the house Jess. - I'm all right Nicholas. Sure we'll have to remember where we were when he was killed, you, I, Addie, Somers... Sophie. She'll have to remember too. All right Mr. Somers, thank you very much. Perhaps you'd be good enough to send Ms Malraux in now? Very well Inspector. Yes, Mr. Somers? I know this is none of my business Inspector, but the girl is likely to be a bit nervous. And, well, I wouldn't get too much by appearances, that's all. That's all right Mr. Somers. It'll just be the facts that count. Right, I'll get her. Yes, I'd like to know something more about Mr. Somers. I bet he's talked to the girl already this morning so can't be help. You know these people Stuart, what do you think of Mrs. Fenton's evidence? I think she's trying to protect the girl sir. You noticed, she didn't really wanted... to tell us about seeing her go out in the middle of the night. - I think she's too honest not to. - Yes and she tried to hide the girl's coat. It's beginning to look like an open and shut case all right. Sit down Miss Malraux. I just like to ask you a few questions. That is if you are prepared to answer them of course I don't know anything. Well, last night... did you go out at all? - Out? - Yes Miss Malraux, out. Out of this house. - Well yes, I think I did. - Well, aren't you sure? - Yes, I did go out. - What time would that be? I don't know, in the night. - Where did you go to? - To the wood, by the church meadow. Now, why did you do that? - Was it to meet someone? - No. - You knew this man Hick, didn't you? - Yes, I knew him. - Did you like him? - No, I didn't. But I didn't kill him. Was it to meet Hick that you went out to the wood at three o'clock this morning? - No, it was to get my comb. - Your comb? I left it at the edge of the wood. Hick had spoiled it so I left it there. And so in the middle of the night you put on your... coat and went to get a comb that left in the wood, is that it? Yes. - Will you show me the comb Miss Malraux. - I haven't got it, I couldn't find it. - Had Hick taken it again? - No. I get things muddled, I get things wrong way around. You're like Jess, you're trying to confuse me. We're not trying to confuse you Miss Malraux. We only want the facts. But I was angry because he took my comb. Ah, now yes, we are back to the comb again Miss Malraux. This comb that you went out to look for this morning and couldn't find... what exactly was it like? I brought it from France, it belonged to my mother. Yes Miss Malraux, but what was it like? Was it like that for instance? Yes, it was. That's my knife. That belonged to my mother too. I see Miss Malraux. That'll be all for now, thank you very much. I'll have to ask you not to leave the house, if you don't mind I think we should be wanting you for questioning a little later on. - They want to see you again Jess. - Well child? Sophie, what happened? They think I killed him just because of my comb. Where did you get it? You tell me you couldn't find it last night. But I found it, it was in the wood where you dropped it I couldn't find it, not in the dark, I had no light with me. You see, I think I didn't think. Sure because of a nightmare I have. Are you sure? I think so. Well, this is one thing the police won't find. But they got your coat. How did the blood get on it? What blood? I haven't seen my coat they took it away. There's a blood stain on it, they found it because Jess tried to hide it.. Did Jess try to hide it? - I remember, she came and took it away. - When? This morning after the police came, she said it had to be cleaned. David, I'm so frightened. - You will help me, won't you? - Yes, of course I will. But what you really need is a lawyer. I know the very man, we drive up to London this afternoon I can't, the police said I wasn't to leave the house. Oh they did, did they? We'll that settles that. Never mind, you listen to me, I'll tell you what we can do. - What's the matter? Why aren't you ready? - I'm not going David. You want to stay here and get yourself arrested? I mustn't run away. Sofie, if things were different you'd be right. But not know, don't you realize how strong the case is against you? But I didn't kill him. I know, but someone is trying to make it look as if you did and they're succeeding. - But, who? - Your aunt perhaps. Jess wouldn't do that to me. - Besides she was trying to hide the coat. - They found it just the same. David, perhaps I did kill him and I can't even remember. Of course you didn't kill him, you couldn't kill him. - And then who did? - I'm not certain. But one thing I know. As long as you're free the real killer won't feel safe. Something more has to happen and it's then the killer make mistakes. You mustn't help me they'll blame you too. There is no crime in taking someone to see a lawyer. Besides, I hate traps. And I'm getting you out of this one. I've done it before for people I didn't even know. So I can do it for, for someone I love. And don't you argue anymore. You go back to your room and get your things ready, quickly. Had you had enough breakfast? Good, I'll think I'll get along now. - Aren't I going with you? - No Sophie, better I see Chubb alone first. It really it's better that way. Have you any money? Good, now then, where shall we meet? - You know the Holborn underground? - No, but I'll can find it. Fine. Go to the Holborn underground and wait on the King's Cross platform until I come... I'll get there by, by 10:30, alright? - Holborn Underground, King's Cross Platform. - Right, bye now. Well, I expected you before this. - I missed my breakfast. - What you mean? You've been staying with Nicholas Fenton at White Lodge, Tapgrove, Hampshire. So you did keep tabs on me. I thought Willy was too good to be true. - You know Fenton? - No. - You know his wife? - No. And I don't know her niece, the girl who's wanted for murder. - What is this Somers? - What makes you think she did it? The knife, the coat, the cock and bull story about the comb, the nature of the girl. The aunt is been expecting it, blames herself for letting it happen. What you doing in all this, Somers? She had the opportunity too, you forget that Chubb. She's on her head, she won't hang, they'll shut her up. But what's got to do with you anywhere. Where you leave her? Corner House, Piccadilly, you mind if I go myself? As you like, the police will be with you there. They've been waiting for you since crack of dawn. Here, catch. It's yours, it works now. There she is, overt there in the corner. - You coming over? - No, I'd rather wait outside. - Excuse me Miss. - Hello boys. Come on. Excuse me Miss. - They were ahead of us. - The police? Yes, there's a warrant out for your arrest. - I should've to go. - No Sophie no, there's too much against you. We got to get away, we're going north. - How? - By boat. Thank you. - Where we going? - Newcastle. - Where do go when we get to Newcastle? - Oh? China, South America, you choose. We can't go abroad just like that. You have to have passports and tickets and things don't you? I got friends, you'd be surprised at the chums I pick up, you know. - People will help us? - Yes, people have helped me before. There some clothes in there for you, I bought them in Oxford Street, I hope they fit. And you better change into them, there maybe a police description out. Won't the police be checking people getting off the boats? No, they'll be watching those leaving the country, not those coming in. The trouble is Superintendent, you can never tell with these chaps. They are trained to look at one thing and think another. Any idea where he might make for sir? Might be anywhere. Remember this chap had got contacts all over the place. Our men have a free rein, we don't ask questions. Yes, they have some pretty funny friends one way or another. Yes, I'm afraid you will have your work cut out to find him. If he lasts that long, he has that girl with him, remember. I'll tell you what. I'll lend you someone who knows the ropes if you like, another agent. - It's very good of you sir. - No, it isn't, I'm being good to myself. I don't want this department in the news. Scotland Yard is now been called in for the inquiry into the murder at White Lodge , Tapgrove, Hampshire. The police of five counties are now looking for a man and a girl. Who, it is thought, may be help with the inquiries. We haven't got a chance, have we? Of course we have, don't you worry, we'll get away. You shouldn't be helping me, they'll blame you too Sofie, I don't like traps, traps of any kind. Besides, you didn't kill him. - Then who did? - I don't know. We're getting time to find out. If you can the girl at the same time, so much the better but Somers is our job. - Bring him in. - I see. He knows half the secrets of this department. He had 18 months on counter espionage at the end of the war. And knows more ways in and out of this country than a carrier pigeon. It might be nice reading for the Sunday papers, wouldn't it? Yes, very. This is his history ever since I known him, the answer may be there. With his experience in the north, I'd say he'd make for Newcastle. This is Newcastle. Passengers from the London train traveling to Edinburgh should move over to platform 8. Fares please. Fares, please. - Anything sir. - Yes, two Jesmond please. Thank you. Get in Mr. Somers and the lady, no arguments, get in. Minna, he's here. Minna. Dear Minna. I didn't know. I must be grateful to be here at all. I'm very happy you came to us. Was the last thing I intended to do. - I'm afraid Karl persuaded me. - Karl was right. Now perhaps we can pay a little of our debts. You see, I dare not come back to Minna without you I'm Minna and this is my husband Karl. We're friends of Mr. Somers and we want to be your friends. - We want to help you. - It's good to have friends. Professor Werner, Paul Duclas... Max Reiner and Karl and Minna Cesare. Yeah, Cesare. No, just their latest addresses. Oh, and check them on the trains to Newcastle, there's a pal. Yes, I'll be here. - Sir. - Oh, good afternoon. - I want.. - Won't you sit down? - I'd like... - I'll take Pongo. Give them all names mister because they are so many. Yes, yes, of course. A gentleman has asked me to call for the red fox. - Is the fox male or female? - The fox is female. Will it remain with your friends on this voyage? Yes, that is the idea. I'm told that there is a good market in Mexico City. Mexico City? Right, I'll tell my friend what you say. Now then, when may I call for the fox? My daughter will bring it to you tonight. Kyra. - Kyra is my daughter's name. - Yes Dad? - Hello. - Yes, we... We've met before. She will meet you down at the old steps, near Surtees' house. - Good, 11 o'clock? - She will be punctual. Oh, the price of the animal will be 150 pounds. - Yeah, yeah, it's ridiculous. - Inclusive. You look very tired my friend, you should take a holiday. Me? Holidays costs money. Why, would a hundred pounds give you a pleasant weekend at the seaside? - There. - Well, perhaps 125? I'll give it to your daughter. - With your experience, it should be easy. - Yes. Karl, it might be easy but it will be expensive. Now, we grew this out, we thought you might need it. No Minna, I knew you would do this, I can't take it. You must've money, where are you going to get it? - There are ways. - And take more risks? Now where would we be if we refused your help? He gave Karl and me our freedom, now we want to help you, take this. - Don't be silly. - Thank you, Minna. I'll see you get it back. We can manage, we don't care for that money. There is something more important. We have been talking to this child, she's very troubled. While you were away I found out that Karl was a doctor. He's been trying to help me. You know Mr. Somers... that we'd much experience of persecution. We know it's only necessary when very big lies have to be told. - This girl is suffering from such a lie. - Yes, I think so too. But in one part of her mind she still knows the truth. - Are you expecting anyone? - No. - Into the kitchen. - Wait in there. Thank you Karl, Sophie. - Doctor Cesare? - Yes. - My name is Shepley. - Yes? - I trying to find a friend of yours. - We have only a few friends in England. If it were not for this friend, you wouldn't be in England now. Oh, I haven't seen him, not for years. - May I come in? - By all means I'd like to meet your wife, she may be able to help us. Of course. Minna, we have a visitor. Come on, we go. I want you to understand that I've nothing to do with the police force. I'm not looking for the girl. So you see if you have helped him, you may have done him a disservice. We don't worry, wherever he is, Mr Somers can take care of himself. And of her. - Hello. - Oh hello Kyra. Here you are big boy, this will get you on the boat. Thanks. - They sail a week tonight from Liverpool. - What about passports? Be outside the Hainan coffee on the same day 12:30. Be a street bookie waiting, you must speak from the language learning. Hau yen chow fan Bo Lao Gai, he'll answer, Yung chow Dan. Hau yen chow fan Bo Lao Gai and Yung chow Dan. Clever boy. Butterfly girl, it's a pretty name, isn't it? - Did she do it? - No, but that's difficult to prove. Poor little thing. - Well, goodbye. - Bye Kyra, thank you. David. They're working very hard, aren't they? They blocked both the bridges. Never mind, we'll take that boat, come on, the road across. - What about this one? - No, no, it's too obvious. That's the baby. We'll soon fix this. Nothing safe, is it? Oh, we'll look after her. Right. All right, thank you. They found the car, abandoned on the moor. - Give them a good start. - Not good enough. You'll see, we'll get them. I'll take this one and... have you any buns or sausage rolls or something? Sorry sir, the baker doesn't deliver until 9:30 or so. - How about some apples? They're good eaters. - All right, two pounds of apples please. That'll be four and six. Hey, what do you doing up there? I'm hungry David, can't we stop here and have something? You're always hungry. What about those apples? There are still some left in your bag. I want some tea, I'm sick of apples, aren't you? Well yes, but I don't think we ought to stop here. Well, there's nobody in then, we needn't stay long. All right, just this once then. Sophie, what did you and Karl talking about? I asked him about getting muddled and if that did happen to people. He asked me a lot of questions and... then he said it did happen to some people... but not to me. And then he said there was something that I forgotten that I had to remember. And that when I do remember, I won't feel muddled anymore. Was it something about finding your parents dead? That. Something else. Come on, we better get our bus. Hey Mike. What's the matter Eric? Fares, please. - All the way please. - Two for Patterdale. Thank you. I was looking forward to that tea. - You left your bag. - No, I got it here. - No, your hand bag. - But I haven't got it. You had it at the cafe. - Oh yes, I left it on the chair. - Come on. That young man spotted you, the one at the tea place. What we going to do? They'll comb the lakes. But we shan't be here, we cut across to Liverpool. They got on the Patterdale bus. Yes, about ten minutes ago. Right sir. The main party is going up the hill with the wireless van sir. - Straight ahead. - Good thank you. Straight on. - They're going ahead. - Right, thank you, drive on. We'll give them a minute, then we'll double back. Still hungry? - I'm scared. - I know. Here. Put these things into your bag. We got to travel light now. This rough country, we are damned to use the roads, not by daylight. Hot you, eh? - Well, it's theirs all right. - Anything interesting in it? No, nothing they couldn't have bought anywhere. No, there wouldn't be. Look, we've made three rings of police. This is where we found the bag, so we know that they come through the outer ring. Well, there's only one way they can go, to the mountain. When they do that, we got them. - He's got out of tighter places than that. - I believe you want him to get away. Well, I'm sounding the tally-hos this time but I tell you quite... frankly I hope I don't give the bush. They've been sighted towards Copley Wood Jess. It's Jess. Nonsense, nonsense. Of course it isn't. It was Jess. I thought I saw Jess. No Sophie, you didn't. Come on here, we got to get moving. All right now? That wasn't Jess you saw. I thought it was for a moment, was so frightened. - Because I remembered. - Remembered what? That's how it was when I saw my mother and father. Someone was there with a gun. - I thought you found them first. - That's what Jess said. She always explained it that way. She said I had a shock and thought I saw someone. That's what I remembered in the woods just now. I wasn't muddled. - Someone was there with a gun. - Who was it, was it Jess? I don't know, I can't remember. The night when Hick was killed, you didn't even see him, did you? No, but they tried to make me think I did. - You believe me, don't you? - Yes Sophie, of course I believe you. But I'm not the police. Ok, fly captain, message understood, out. The helicopter chap said there was no sign of anyone in Copley Wood. Black mark, fly catcher. Helicopter report, couple seen near Sourmilk Gill sir. Telephone Keswick... tell them to send all mobile reserves to the bottom of Sourmilk Gill, immediately. - Priority one. - Yes sir. This must be Sourmilk Gill. Well, if we follow the waterfall down take us to old track that lead us to the main road. Keswick Section Station here, message 1350. Superintendent requests all available mobile patrols. Yes. Concentrate north of Sourmilk Gill. We're trapped, aren't we? Look Sophie, we just got time to jump before they see us, think that you can make it? - I can't, David, it's too wide. - All right. Never mind. Do you see that ledge down there? Get in there and make yourself small as you can. - And what are you going to do? - I'll draw them off. Give me your raincoat. After they've gone and when it's dark. Make your way back to the lake side where we got off the bus. - Remember? And wait for me there. - Supposing they catch you? They won't, I'll come for you, I promise. Lake side, where we got off the bus. See you tonight. - Be careful. - I will. - Where's the girl? - She's not here? - No, she's gone away. - Which way. That's your worry. Well, we got Somers. The girl won't be much trouble on her own. You better move the men to the other side of the gully as quick as you can. Is that wise? If she got away on that side and Somers wouldn't leave her behind... there's no point for a whole lot of men standing around on this side. How bad is Somers? The say he broke a couple of ribs and may have fractured an ankle. My ribs. Thanks. - How your legs? - Hurt. I'm sorry chap. Open the door. What? Well, get after him, quick, move. Get a car as quick as you can. Knocked out the policeman and struck the driver, I suppose. - Come on. - I told you Sophie. David. I was so afraid. Are you really all right? Of course I'm alright, just worried for you. I thought I was going to have to give myself up. I'm very glad you didn't because we got to take things into our own hands now. And the first thing is you got to have a talk with Jess. With Jess? It'll be all right, only on the telephone. They are coming through. Hello. Hello, Jess? Where are you? Well, I see. Why are you telephoning? I need help Jess, to get away. - Abroad. - Where are you? You take very wrong to run away Sophie. You must give yourself up to the police, mustn't you Sophie? No, I need help Jess. - Things aren't quite the same any longer. - Tell her you started remembering. I don't get muddled anymore. What do you want? No, that's too much, I haven't got it. Two hundred? Yes, all right. How can I give it to you? No, no, the place wouldn't be safe. - I'll bring it to you myself. - All right Jess. Yes all right - I'll be at... - 5 Coronation Way, Liverpool. - 5 Coronation Way, Liverpool. - Thursday. Yes, Coronation, Thursday afternoon at three o'clock. - You won't fail me, will you Jess? - No, I won't fail. Supposing she brings the police? I don't think she will. Anyway it's a chance we got to take. Sorry, we missed catching that. All right sir, hop in. - Hello Nora, anything wrong with Glasgow? - I sure like to change sometimes. Your room will cost you a fiver this time Somers, she's hot. I only want it for an hour or two Nora. We're expecting a visitor this afternoon, a lady. We want a private talk at three o'clock, you understand? I do, but it still cost you a fiver. What's the matter? Is this stuff getting more expensive? I like the room ready in an hour, Nora. All right, but watch yourself, I don't want any trouble. Nor do we. How do you feel like? - Hau yen chow fan Bo Lao Gai. - Yung chow Dan. - What time is red fox on? - Midnight. - And the jockey? - Francesca. - What about passports? - Another 25 nickel. - Foxes are up today. - So are butterflies. Thank you. Listen, Royal North Atlantic Dock, Bay D. Shed opposite a big crane. Packing case marked with letter K, red chalk. Side opens easily, room for two. Ship closely watched but captain willing, got it? Royal North Atlantic... - What was he saying? - Scram Charlie, it's the cops. Mr. and Master Fox. Master Fox, that means you got to have your hair cut off. - Waiter. - Yes, will be? Hau yen chow fan Bo Lao Gai. - This way please. - Where are we going? Have our photographs taken. Thank you. Come on, put my coat on. What about this hair? She can cut it later, for the photograph, I'll retouch it. Good. You all right? Look straight in the camera. No, no smiles, serious please. Oh, here you are. Upstairs, first door on the right. And if you hear me buzz it'll means the boys is back again. So down the fire escape quick, the both of you Sophie, get into my pullover and your slacks, I'm going out to get you a jacket. And while I'm away cut some of that hair off. - Do I have to? - Yes, Master Fox you do. If the police do come... and you have to go down fire escape you know where to go, don't you. North Atlantic Dock, Bay D. Packing case with red K. - Room for two. - Good. Goodbye Sophie, I won't be long, I'll take this. - Nora... - Yes. I'm just going out a few minutes. I'll be back before three. You might send some tea up to the girl, will you? I will, be assured. Third degree, third degree not allowed England. Fourth degree, if you don't talk. Now then, what name? - Come on, what name? - Mr. Fox and Master Fox. Master Fox, Master Fox. The old girl said you might like a cup of tea I'll put it down here, shall I? Good morning Mr. Croft, how's tricks? Oh boy, so and so. - You got those clothes for me? - I wasn't quite sure of the size. - To fit a boy. - Yes? - A slim boy. - Well, one of these? No too big. Not too big. - No, no. - Hello Chum. Being sporter shopping for Master Fox? Well, shall we push off? Yes, if you wish. I shan't ask you where she is. No, of course not, could be a waste of time, wouldn't it? Anyway, it's you I'm after. The train now standing at platform 7 is the Express. For London. And will be leaving in two minutes, stopping at Crewe, Rugby and Euston. If the department did things properly Willy, you have reserved seat for us. Yeah, I know old boy, but then we couldn't absolutely... depend on a chap like you to fill them. - Oh, you underestimate yourself. - Oh, I'm a realist. - You ought to have done it at the station. - I didn't want. Hey madame, excuse me. Come here David. Let me, let me help you. Leg me take the little fella. - You come with me. - Would you mind? Thank you very much. Go with the gentleman. - Excuse me ma'am. - Oh, don't push. - Sorry. - That's right. - Let me through madam. - Take your hands off me. Madam please, you'll find out, your son is probably been kidnapped Ernie. Yes. Nicholas. Now we mustn't make a sound child, we must be very quiet. - I know. - You must be quiet. Nicholas. Don't scream or I'll have to stop you and I don't want to do it that way. - You see, I am very fond of you. - Where's Jess? She's waiting for me, she won't be here. This is something that I have to do. It was you who killed my mother. I remember now. I saw you. And then Jess came. That day in the garden. You killed my mother. Only because she interfered, I didn't want to kill her. It was him. Jess liked him. He had to go. Just like Hick had to go. I warned Jess, but she wouldn't take any notice I'm the only one she protects. As long as I have Jess, I'm safe I'm sorry, child. It's locked, we shan't be disturbed Sophie. Sophie. Sophie. Fenton. - Willy. - Get in. Willy. Can't stop here sir. Little boy in blue here is getting impatient. If this another game of yours, I don't think the department will be able to help. Hurry them up, Willy, hurry them up. - Inspector. - Sir? - Bay D. - Right, drive on. Go right. - Hey, hey, she's up there. - Yes, she is, let's get her. Now wait, there's your man. Come on quick. Can you lift me up there. Right. Hold on, Sophie. David, David, David.
