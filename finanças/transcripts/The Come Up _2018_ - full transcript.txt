How many clubs have you got? - Hm, now you're asking. - [she chuckles] Must be late to this party. This is looking very cosy. Very cosy. Jason. I want you to meet Mustafa. Mus is one of my most valued clients and he dabbles in your line of work. Nice to meet you, bro. Ready to go? Come on, Jason, just sit down. [Mus] Surely you don't have to rush off yet. There's so much we could be talking about. Selene has been filling me in with all the information about you and Bev. - Oh, has she? - Yeah. And that beautiful work you done at the warehouse. Nice. Clinical... but desperate. Mustafa... I've no idea what you're talking about. Of course you don't. Of course you don't. What I'm trying to say is, Beverley's been running East London for a long time now. You see, every good thing must come to an end, rude boy. Mind how you talk. Nothing ain't coming to an end, rude boy. Are you sure about that? I'm just giving you a chance to jump ship. Seeing as we've got mutual friends and all that. Mutual friend? [exhales] Selene. Selene! - I'll speak to you later, OK? - Yeah. [distant siren] How do you do this? - What, you don't need some help? - Yes, please. You need to put your body weight on it, that's why it weren't moving. - Girl, he's beautiful. - He is. - Who sent this man from Heaven? - Exactly. [both laugh] I think he's traditional. - You finished there? - You know what, yeah? I'm done. You're gonna need a new spare tyre, but you should be good for now. - Thank you. You saved my life. - That's cool. - I just moved in to flat B. - Yeah? Be nice if you come round, get a hot chocolate. Know what? I don't think my girl would appreciate that. - You got a girl? - Yeah. - That's fine. - You take care, man. See you round. - Girl, he just swerved me. - That was rude! He don't want all of this? Come on. [quiet chatter] [woman] Wagwan, G-Money? - You all right? - Mm. - When you taking me out to dinner? - Why you cook? What happened to cooking, that's what I'm saying? Can't cook? Listen...

That don't mean I can't preview. Look at that car behind. It's been following us. - It's a five-door. - That's Jake's. New plate. Brah, they're speeding up. - Oh, my days. - Fuck's sake. [siren] Get out the car, please, boys. Out the car. Turn the engine off, please, sir. Jason, can you get out the car, please? I'm arresting you on distribution of class A drugs and possession of firearms. Let's go for a walk, son. If you'd like to put your pencils down, please. Keep quiet. Get up. That's it. In twos, by the door. Nice... Nice and quick now. That's it, darling, this way. That's it. There we are. Quickly. That's it, file out. Out you go. It's all right, we'll get it later. That's it. Well done. Quick as you can. Nice and quiet. Fantastic. There we are. Hurry up. [sighs] Bingo. [quiet chatter] What? [indistinct chatter] Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Forget it, forget it, forget it. Relax, bro, relax. Relax. Come on. Clappers. - Who, that Robocop one? - What's he got a towel on his head? - Who the fuck is he? - We fucked up his brother when we was younger. Fuck it, man. - What's the problem, bruv? - What's going on, bro? Is there a problem, bruv? Nervous. Nervous. [all shouting] [guard] Get out! Get out! Get out! Seven... eight... nine... ...ten. Mad ting. I need a shower, man. Hey, let me get a shampoo, brother. Shampoo? - Hey, man, that is low. - Low? - Low. - You work for Bev. What does that mean? She's been taking care of herself, she don't care about us, man. What's going on with your brother, you heard from him? I have, you know. They shipped my man to some jail in Wales. - Wales? They're handling men like that? - [indistinct mumbling] Mad. But she's saying they haven't been able to visit him still, sad. My man's only got, what, 18 months left? Yeah, he's gonna be a D-cat soon. 18 months. He'll be home in a minute, man. Man go every day, my brother. Trust me. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. - You gonna get involved? - In what? Man's controlling this area. - Go back over your side, bro. - Just wanted to use the weights. Fuck that, bruv. Step over to your side, bro. - Be easy, G, man. - No, fuck that, man. Can't man bang weights in peace? [grunting] You fucking mug. Get off! Get off! Wagwan? The London boy catching on the fucking gym. Good though, bruv. - Up on that, rude boy. What's good? - [indistinct chatter] You see my man? My man look like Robocop. You see when he was over me? - The little small one? - Nah. That's the one I don't like. Him. I heard them running up and down the wing the other day, fam. Yeah, but now he's rolling with them Birmingham ones. I'm gonna bust his head open, trust me on that one. - You say the face is bad? - Yeah, it's bad, rude boy. I've got a visit coming as well to check me. Don't worry who I got visiting me. I see you on the visit the other day, though. - I see how you're moving, dog. - The little skirt? The one in the short skirt? What do you mean, fam? What? Fam. Being in jail, you talk about all these girls, they ain't seen one ting. Not one. - I ain't seen not one. - They're in the ghetto waiting for me. One minute. What's going on? Wagwan? - Why you coming over here, rude boy? - I ain't come here for that, fam. - What you come for then? - To speak to the big man. You don't speak to no big man, fam. What you talking about? - Yo, G. - Hey, shall we get this cracking, fam? - You're talking to no one. - You forget all of that, fam. - What you looking at? - Brother, take the bass out your voice. - What bass out of my voice? - Where's your fucking sleeves, fam? You think you're in Marbella or something? - Comedian, innit? - Yeah, joker, fam. What? Talk then, what's going on? - How can we sort this out? - Sort out what? - See what you've done to my face? - That's what I'm trying to sort out. You want to sort out? Come on then, let's go sort it out. - [indistinct chatter] - Forget all of that. It's cool, it's cool, it's cool. All right, we'll sort it out. - Me and you, then? - Yeah. We'll talk. - All right, cool. - He looks excited. Yeah, I'm excited about everything, big man. - Catch you on the rebound. - Catch me on the rebound, rude boy? He speaks. You see my man, I don't like him. I'm gonna bust his head open. Don't like him at all. [Jason] Wagwan? I come in peace. Calm down, brother. Panicking. You shook. You don't mind if I make myself comfortable? Let me apologize on behalf of G. My misunderstanding. Apology accepted. Now get the fuck out of here. I heard you got a Tec flying about. If you let me use that, I'll make sure you and your people are well looked after here, bruv. My people are good, G. Don't need no looking after. Very aggressive. Anyway, this Tec, you know what the powers are. Let me make one or two calls... ...deal with what I got to deal with, and I can pattern something for you in the process. Think about it, innit. Yes! [chatter] Wagwan? - [classical music] - [phone ringing] Who's this? Hey. Why are you calling me on this dodgy number? [Selene] Look, whatever big move you're doing with Bev, needs to lead to result, because now we have responsibilities. I'm pregnant. Aren't you gonna say something?

Where are they? - Place is empty, blood. - What am I meant to do? Yo, J? Right now, they're our options. Sounds like the best plan to me. You, man, have gone mad. We men are the bosses, innit. [officer] Ma'am. If we leave them long enough, they're bound to give in. Unless your hunch forms a legal basis for detention, we have to let them go. Goodness, this is proving to be a very expensive joke. Ma'am, they're running a tight operation here in Jamaica. If you leave, I will solve the case. But I really don't want you to. But we got to get this guy, man, we have to get the boy. We have to get him as every last rough club wanna bet.

You been speaking to your pastor? So, tell me, what's your pastor saying? I'm gonna focus on church and getting a job, bro. What are you gonna write on your application? What you gonna do on your CV? You gonna say, "I got previous history in doing a bit of robbery and selling some drugs"? Are you mad? - Jesus my vibe, man. - You know what, fuck off. You see when it gets on top for you? See when it gets on top for you like it did when your babymother starts getting in your ears, talking about she needs money for fucking petrol, and you can't even get your daughter a birthday present or a party. Don't come back around here, and remember, when your friend fucking needed you, you was too busy talking to your pastor about I need money and I need a job. Fuck off, man. Dickhead, Mitch. This guy's a dickhead, man. Taking the piss, man. Come out of there, man.
