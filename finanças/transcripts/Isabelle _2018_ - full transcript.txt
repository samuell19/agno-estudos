- They know what they're doing. We're fine. - They have to be careful with it. Ah, da, da, da. - It's okay. Always expecting the worst. What a drama queen. It's fine. - My grandmother gave me that piano. - I know, so why don't you use it? - I do, I teach. - I mean your own music. - After the baby. - You're always saying that. - No, I'm, stop. Neighbor. - Oh, hey. - Welcome to the neighborhood An original piece. Oooh. Aw, little Larissa. Ow. - Hey! what's wrong, what's wrong? - Oh my god. The baby just kicked me really hard. - Yeah? - Yeah, right there. Feel that. - Wow, he's excited. - Strong. - Are you sure about all this? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I mean, I think it's a little late to be asking that now. - No, I just, you know, new firm. - Don't worry about it. I can handle it. - But do you want this baby? - What a crazy question. Did you hear what she just asked? He says that was cold, mom. I like Colton, after your dad. That's really nice. We still need a middle name. - What about your dad's name? Clifford? No, I don't think so cause he hates it. What about Francis after my cousin? - Oh yeah. He was so sweet. - Yeah. - Colton Francis Kane. - Yeah. - It's actually really good. It really is. Do you know how much I love you? - Yeah. - Can I show you? No, come on, I look like a beached whale. - We like whales. - Yeah. - And we donated to that charity, remember? - Mm-hmm. - So how's Matthew? Is he still nervous about being a father? - Terrified. Speaking of Matthew, we had sex tonight. - So, Colton's gonna spend his whole childhood in therapy. - Are you saying we did something wrong? - I'm joking, lighten up. - Dr. Chan said that it was okay. - And it is okay, you worry too much? - You still plan on being here for the birth, right? - Yeah, of course. - Hey, baby hasn't kicked for a couple hours. Maybe something's wrong. - Oh, no, no. I'm sure he's just tired. He's probably listening to the doctor's advice, nothing strenuous, remember? - What if something's wrong? - Everything's gonna be all right. - Where'd you get this? That I stole from the neighbor's yard. - You stole it? - Risked my life. - Wow. - See what I do for you? I'm off. Okay My dad texted me, wants me to meet him outside. - Outside? - Yeah. - Everything okay? Yeah, you know my dad. He's always okay. - Thanks for breakfast. - My pleasure. Hey. - Hey. - Still working the night shift? - Somebody has to. - So, what's up? - I went shopping. - Oh my god. Were you like this when I was a kid? - Oh, worse. - So this is what you do, huh? What if I suck at being a dad? - Suck, how're you gonna suck? Anyway, I got your back. - Yeah, at first I, I would prefer to wait a couple years for the whole baby thing. But now I gotta say, I'm really excited. I know there'll be some changes and few adjustments. - Whoa, not a few changes. Everything, trust me, everything's gonna change. - That's why my client's willing to settle. Let me just draft up the paperwork. Take a look at it. Okay, thank you. - Latte, double espresso. - Carol, thank you. This is the fourth day in a row. You're an intern. You really shouldn't be doing this for me. Thank you. - Hi. I'm Larissa, just moved in. What's your name? - Ann. - Ann, nice to meet you. It's a boy, due in four weeks, six days, eight hours and two minutes. At least that's what we're hoping. Ow! Help me, help me, please! Here, call 911. - Vitals? We need to stop the bleeding. Blood pressure's dropping. - I've lost the baby's pulse. Code blue, code blue. We have a code blue in OR two. - It's eclampsia. She spent a full minute clinically dead. You need to know there may be some residual effects. - What about the baby? - I'm sorry. - I wanna see my baby. - Sweetheart, I'm not so sure that's a good idea. I saw it. - It? - Yeah, well, him. I saw him-- - I need to see Colton. Please. - Excuse me, father? My wife, we just lost a child. - Hello, Larissa. I'm Father Lopez, the hospital chaplain. My condolences. Do you want me to pray with you? - I want to see my son. - Shall we pray? - Yeah. Thank you for trying to help. Let me get that, honey. Hey, hey, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay, what is it? What is it? Look at me, look at me. I'm gonna get the nurse. - After such a trauma, bad dreams are not unexpected. You're gonna go through a whole range of emotions. It's a unique kind of grief. Many of my patients find these antidepressants quite helpful. So, there's a pharmacy downstairs. She'll likely feel a bit dizzy or woozy till her body adjusts. It might take a few days. The hospital recommends that we see each other on a weekly basis. How's that sound? - Will that bring back my baby? I died for a minute. Do you have any idea what I saw? - Easy. - Whoa. - You okay? - The doctor's right. Those pills do make me woozy. - Hey, what did you see? - When? - What you said to Dr. Niedorf. What did you see when you flat-lined? - Can't remember. That woman is so weird. - Honey, Jessica's said she's left you four voicemails. Are you not gonna call her back? You sure you're okay with me going to work today? - Yeah. - Okay, I just think if we want things to get back to normal. - Normal. How are we supposed to get back to normal? - Well-- - How could you sleep last night? Just like that, you just fell asleep. - I don't know. This is really hard on me, too, okay? - You didn't want the baby. - You know that's not true. - We never should have had sex that night. - What? - This is your fault. - Okay, fine. Take your meds. You're gonna want to have something in your stomach. - Morning, Matt, latte. - Okay, it's Mr. Kane. What do you want from me, Carol? - Morning. Ruth Stanton, five houses down. This is Barney. How's the baby? - What do you mean? - Well you moved in pregnant and now you're not, so-- - The baby was stillborn. - Oh god, I'm so sorry. I really am. Look, if you ever need anything or if you just want to talk, let me know. - I'm Larissa, Larissa Kane. - I'll pray for you. - Thank you Hey, Ruth. - Yeah? - That woman in that house, Ann, she have any children? - Yeah, a daughter. I mean, I don't know much about her except that she's in a wheelchair and she usually sits at that upstairs window. - Yeah. - She's been doing it for years. - Kinda creeped me out at first, but I got used to it. - It's okay! It's okay, Colton, mama's here. Shh, shh, it's okay, it's okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop. - I had to work late, I'm sorry. Okay. Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right. Are you okay? - Yeah I saw him. Colton. In his crib. What did I do wrong? - Nothing. You didn't do anything wrong. - No, I should've, I should've stayed dead, not him. - Hey. Sweetie, don't even talk like that. - You asked me what I saw. When I was dead. Someone or something, grabbed me. And it just, I tried to scream, but couldn't make a sound, and I tried to run, but I couldn't move, and it just kept pulling me down to like, fire, there was flames burning. I don't know. Save me. - Come here. ♪ Rock-a-bye, baby ♪ On the treetop ♪ When the wind blows ♪ The cradle will rock - Ah, ah. - Hey, Dr. Neidorf wants to up your medication and wants you to take one extra pill each time, okay? Might make you a little dizzy, so... Here's that list I made of your students. You should call 'em. - I can't, babe, I... - You need to take it easy today. Make sure you eat. - Guardian angel. Just like in high school. Want me to walk you out? - Yeah, please. - You know what I'm gonna do? I am gonna bake you your favorite chocolate cake with a chocolate whipped cream icing. - Really? - Yeah. See, I don't need a shrink, I just need some time. My God. That nosy woman and her daughter. - She has a daughter? - Yeah. And she's obsessed with me, she just stares at me, watches me all day from that window up there. - Call those students. - 'kay. You know, some of those students just can't handle Mozart. - Try Beethoven. And take your meds. - I can't take it. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. I can't take it anymore. - Has she attempted suicide before? - Once, overdose when she was 16. She was depressed over her dad's death. - We'll keep an eye on her overnight. - Okay. - If she's doing better tomorrow, you can take her home. I'll give you a prescription for something to, uh, keep her calm. - Okay. - Help her sleep. - Yeah. - Better get some sleep yourself. - Yeah, yeah, thank you, I know. - Thank you, Lord, for your blessings. - Hi. - Hello, Mr. Kane. How is your wife? - Well, we need to bury the baby. - You've all been in my prayers. - Can I ask you something? Do, uh, do you believe in... You know, I'm sorry, I, it's so crazy. - No, what is it? - Okay, it freaks me out I'm even saying this, but do you believe in possession? - I've seen many things. - Would you at all be able to come by our house tomorrow and maybe have a chat with Larissa? She's been so different. - Near-death experiences can do that to people. They can change them and how they interact with others. - Yeah, she says, um, when she was dead for that minute or so that, that someone or something was, uh, pulling her down into the flames. That she was being burned by the fire. I mean, have, do you ever hear stuff like that? - I can come by at four. - Thank you. - Shall we pray? In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen. - Our Father. Who art in heaven. - Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. - Give us this day our daily bread. and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. - And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Oh, God, forgive me. - You remember when we first met? Everyone in school talking about the girl who tried to off herself. Everyone avoiding me. But not you. You said, "Everything is gonna be all right." We fell in love instantly. It's my guardian angel. - Okay, I gotcha. Careful. Watch your step. Hi, Father Lopez. Uh, I tried calling your office, they say you already left. Look, I apologize for having bothered you. - Apologize? - Yeah, my wife is not possessed, uh, there's not a chance. So, I really, I really apologize for wasting your time. - Would it be all right if I still spoke with her? - Well, she's sleeping. - No, she isn't. Hello, Mrs. Kane. I'm here to help you. - You can't. - Do you believe in the Devil? In Hell? - I know all about Hell. I'm living it right now. - Is Satan here right now? - Not unless you brought him. - May I bless you? - This isn't an exorcism, Father. This is called grieving. - Okay, Mr. Kane, there are many different kinds of possession-- - Okay, I think it's best if you leave. - I bless you in the name of the father and son and the holy spirit. - Thank you. Thank you for coming. - I must be punished. - The priest said that there are many different types of possessions. But Larissa said she saw some, some sort of-- - Larissa has a hard time letting go. She holds onto stuff, you know that. She can't let go of Colton, she has to. Look, I wanna, I wanna help her do that. - How? - A friend of mine, he works with the dying. He helps people crossover. - Well, Larissa's not dying, so-- - No, but she did die, for a minute. Maybe there's something in that. - Jessica, you know how I feel about all this woo-hoo stuff. - Hey, you reached out to me. This is how I can help. I'll be on the first flight tomorrow morning, no need to even pick me up, okay? Nice house. - Thanks. - My sister. - My beautiful sister. - Hi, hi. - Okay, come on. We're gonna get out of bed, you're gonna throw away those pills. Matthew's gonna go off to work, and you and I are going to see Pedro Salazar. - Who? - A friend. Let's go. Let's get you better. Come on, I'll drive your car. - Okay. - It's all right to let go. There's nothing to fear. Nice to see you. - You too. - I'm Pedro. - Larissa. - Nice to meet you. He's at peace. Almost ready. That's not always the case. Many do not go quietly. Not even after death. When you died in the hospital, you went through the gate that divides life and death. That's why you are so attuned to the dead. A spirit is reaching out to you. - Colton. - No, it's still Earth-bound. Not ready to leave. Refuses to go. - But what about Colton? - He's fine. His spirit wants to go. Please. He'll always be a part of you. Let him go. Let him know it's all right. Just close your eyes, and say what you have to say to him. - He's gone. I can feel it. He's gone. - Thank you. - This spirit, she is determined, very powerful. Larissa, do not let her in. - In where? - Inside you. - Is my sister in danger? - Not if your desire is strong. The will to live is everything. - I love you, Jess. Have a safe flight, and a good yoga conference, and just, thank you, for everything. - Okay, I love you. - I love you, too. - Bye. Okay, I'll call you. - Bye. - Bye, sweetie. - Your daughter has been staring at me from that window upstairs day and night and I have had enough of it. Enough. Now, you make her leave me alone, or I will take legal action. - I know how unhappy you are. It's your birthday, Isabelle. 24. All this time watching. Wanting to be like everyone else. I know how unhappy you are. Don't be afraid, Isabelle. Oh please, forgive me. I'm sorry, please forgive me. Let me out right now. Isabelle. I love you. - You. What are you doing in here? I'm calling the cops. - 911, what's your emergency? - Hi, yes, someone broke into my house, and... My mistake, I'm sorry. Yeah. - Larissa, Larissa? Hey, why was the alarm on? What are you doing? - You don't smell that? That disgusting smell. - No, I don't smell anything. - I do. I don't know if, like, rat died under the house, or what, but it's disgusting. - This is Saratoga Springs There are no rats here. - She broke into the house today. - Who? - Ann's daughter, the one who keeps staring at me. She was in Colton's room. - What? Did you call the police? - Yeah, I did. But-- - But what? I don't know, she just, she was gone. She was just back up in her window, in her wheelchair. - Okay, so, somebody in a wheelchair broke into our house and then made it all the way upstairs to the baby's room-- - She wasn't in her wheelchair when she was here. - Okay. Please stop doing that. There is no smell, there's nothing. - Let me show you something. Okay, well she's not there now, but she is almost always there. I'm not on any meds, Matt. - Well, maybe you should be. - I know what I saw. - You also saw our child, and we both know that it's not possible. - I haven't seen Colton since Jessica took me to see Pedro. - Good, then we're making progress. - Yeah, but you think that I just imagined that woman in our house? Yeah, so you think I'm crazy. - I don't know what to think. - Do you think that I should be back on my meds? - I just want my wife back. I want my life to go back to the way it was. - There is no going back. Don't you get that? - Okay, honey, I love you, but if this is gonna be how it is-- - Then what? I don't know, I don't know if I can take much more. - And you think that I can? - I don't think either of us can. - Is that a threat? - It's just the truth. - Well, I made that chocolate cake for you. Hey, can you smell that? - No, I don't smell anything. - There's someone in the house. - Honey, there's nobody in the house. - There's someone in the house. - The alarm's on. - Well, maybe it's not working. - It's working. - Well, are you gonna check? - Yeah. I'm up. - Get the gun. - It's working. - Okay, well someone was in the house. - Okay, I don't wanna argue. I just wanna go to bed. I have depositions in the morning. - Well, then give me the gun. - Not a chance. - Hey there. - Hey. Long night? - Yeah, they all are. Bad guys never sleep. What's up? - When mom walked out on us, when she just left, you know what I used to tell myself is everything's gonna be all right. And I would say that over and over to myself until I actually believed it. But that's crap. Things don't always turn out to be all right. - That's true. But you gotta learn to make the best of the way they do turn out. - Did you hate mom for leaving? - It's tough being married to a cop. - Yeah, did you ever forgive her? - In my own way. But then I had you to look after, didn't I? - Yeah. I don't think I'm as strong as you. - You know, back in high school, when you'd get knocked down or tripped up on the basketball court, my heart would stop. But then you'd get right back up. Keep going. You couldn't be stopped. You put yourself through law school, you pushed and pushed. And I'm so proud of you. Matt, you're the strongest person I know. - Get out. Get out or I shoot. - Larissa? Larissa? Larissa? - I would've made a terrible mother. - Don't say that. - Unfit. - Larissa, don't. - It must be in my genes. - What do you mean? - That my dad had it, and he saw things, heard things. And he went down to the garage, and sat in the car, let the exhaust fumes do what they do. - You said it was a heart attack. - That's just what we told people. I was the one that found him. And I didn't call for my mom. I didn't call for anyone. I just sat there, for hours, just wanting with everything in my body for him to wake up. And then my mom showed up, and just freaked out on me. Told me that I was bad, and I was sick. Just like him. Please don't divorce me. You bitch. Get out, get out, get out! She, she was in... She was right here. She was right here, I saw her. She... There. There, she's in the window. She's in the window. Tell me that you can see her. Matt, look. Tell me you see her. - I don't see anyone. I don't see anyone. - I can't do this anymore. I just want it to stop. I just want it to stop happening. Make it stop. - You really wanna help your wife? Okay, tough love. Commit her to a psychiatric facility. - For how long? - As long as it takes. - I don't think I can do that. I don't think I could put her in a place like that. - Your wife is delusional, paranoid. She's a danger to herself and likely to you. - Jessica. - Make it stop. Please. - Mr. Kane, please come in. - Hi, thanks for seeing me. - My pleasure. Jessica is concerned. - Yeah, I know. So am I. - I warned your wife to stay strong, to fight, to want to live. In her grief, she has lost her will, her desire, yet the spirit wants to live desperately through Larissa. If it can, it will take over her life. - So we're talking about a possession. - Worse. She will exchange Larissa's life for her own. - An exchange. - The spirit senses that Larissa no longer values her own life. That makes her vulnerable. Her life, a good life, is there for the taking. When Larissa came to see me, I felt its rage surrounding her. - Rage. - At it's own imperfect life. And at Larissa, for giving up on hers. If this spirit succeeds, the only way to save your wife is by killing her. - I'm sorry, you want me to kill my wife? - No no, not that way. Please. - What do you mean? . She must be brought back to the gate that separates life from death. And she must choose life. You're afraid, I know, but you love Larissa, and you want to save her. So you must do this. The longer the spirit inhabits Larissa's life, the harder it will be to bring her back. - Can I see this spirit? - If a spirit has recently left its body, then some of us can see it. The longer a body is dead, the less likely we can see its spirit. - Okay, I'm gonna take that as a no. But she can see it. - She's passed through the gate. So she can see spirits clearly as you and I can see each other. You will see the spirit only when it's ready to take Larissa's place, or already has. - This sounds-- - I know, I know. Impossible. You must get Larissa to choose life, or you will lose her forever, Mr. Kane. Please. - Larissa? Honey? Larissa. Oh, God. Hey, hey. Hey, can you hear me? Okay. Come here, come here, come here, come here. Throw up. There you go. We're gonna do that again. Here, have another sip. - She's watching. - There's nobody there. - There is. - I'm gonna go next door. I'm gonna go to that window. I'm gonna show you that there's nobody there, okay? - To show me I'm just like my dad. - Honey, I just wanna help you get better. Stay right here, look for me over there. - Hello? Hello? Mrs. Pelway, it's Matt Kane from next door. Mrs. Pelway? Do you need help? Is anyone home? Hello? Ann? Hello, anyone in there? - 911, what is your emergency? - Yes, hi. I found a body. - You found a body? - Yes, I found a dead body next door. I'm at 999 Oak Drive. - Hello? - Dad. - Matt, what's up? - I just, dad, I think you should come over. Honey, I saw her. I saw her. Sweetheart, I just found her corpse in her bedroom, okay? The police are on their way. Okay look, I'll be back soon. Get some rest. I gotta go talk to them. - Isabelle Pelway, 24. According to records, born paralyzed and mute. Appears she was killed by asphyxiation. Coroner figures about two weeks ago. - We moved in two weeks ago. It's crazy. - So what were you doing in here tonight? - I wanted to talk to Ann, Mrs. Pelway. - About what? - Just neighborhood stuff. - Mr. Kane, what did you wanna talk to her about? - I wanted to talk to her about my wife. Okay? - And when was the last time you saw Ann Pelway? - I think a couple days ago when she was snooping. - Snooping? - Yeah, she looks at us from her window. She does it a lot, it really scares my wife. So I was coming over to talk to Mrs. Pelway, and ask her to stop. - Okay, well we're looking for Miss Pelway, so if you see her, you just give me a call. - Okay. - Be okay, you got this. - Yeah. Hey, thanks for coming. Mmm. Hmm. You know what I think? I think now that the body's been found, it's over. She's at peace. It's really over, Larissa. Everything's gonna be all right. - Isabelle, I thought I could set you free. I thought I was helping you. I was wrong. I was abandoning you like your father. - It's over. Come back to bed. - I'm sorry. I wanted so much more for you. I kept praying for you to come. - The mother's back. Oh my God! We gotta, get down, get down, get down. Don't let her see you. - Smith. - Detective Smith, it's Matt Kane. The woman, the mother, Ann Pelway, she's back. She's right next door at the house. - That's impossible. - No, I'm looking at her right now. - Mr. Kane, I am looking at her right now. Ann Pelway killed herself in her car at some spot by the river. Mr. Kane? Mr. Kane? Are you... Mr. Kane? Send some officers by her house. - I'm here to set you free. To always be with you. That's why I did this. Oh God. Oh, forgive me. - I want you, all mine. - I want my wife back. - Too late. You can't save her. You belong to me. You're mine. - Larissa, I'm here. I'm here, Larissa. I love you. - Stop this. Isabel, stop. Choose life. I can take you to the gate, but you have to want to come back. Choose us. Come back to me, sweetie, please. I love you. Choose life, choose us. Larissa, Larissa, choose life. - Stop or we shoot. - Eclampsia. She spent a full minute clinically dead. You need to know there may be some residual effects. - What about the baby? - You have a healthy son. - Welcome back, sweetheart. Welcome to the world, Colton Francis Kane. Got it, careful. - Thanks. - Hey. We're here. Oh, he's sleeping. What did you see? - What? - What did you see when you were dead? - I can't remember.
