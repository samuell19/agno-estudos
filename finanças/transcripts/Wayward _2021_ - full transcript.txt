- Inhale your arms above your head. Exhale your hands into prayer at your heart and begin to rub those palms together. Thank yourself for taking the time to align your mind, body, heart, and soul. Namaste. - What the hell? What the fuck? Why am I here? Why am I here? Help me. Hey, hey, you got the, you got the wrong guy. You got the wrong guy, I promise, it wasn't me. Whatever you think I did, I didn't do. I didn't do it, I didn't do it. Please. What is that for, what is that for? Please, please, please, I'm sorry. Man, I'm sorry. Please, please, please, please. - And we're back on the weekly "Murder They Wrote" podcast where we break down some of the grizzliest serial killers this side of the Mississippi river. - Well, we do talk both sides. - What have I told you about interrupting my intro? - That it raises our listening base, that I should do it more often? - No, exactly the opposite. Anyway, this month we've been focusing on the gruesome history of the illustrious Mechanic Maniac. - Mm, I still like scroll saw slasher much better. - Which would make sense if he used a scroll saw. But since he doesn't. - Well, I mean, how do you know he doesn't use a scroll saw? - Okay, where in all of the evidence, where does this say that? - Huh? - Well, a scroll saw doesn't move. It's like on a table. How would you? - I'm just saying he could, okay. And how do we even know he's a he? - Like we've been talking about, right. I mean, the police only have minimal evidence as it is. It's it's been what? Nearly 10 years and 13 known victims with no arrests and really no suspect. - Sex on the beach. - I definitely didn't order sex on the beach. - It's worth a shot. You ever tried one? - I think I'm good with this one. - Oh, come on, it tastes good. - Here you go, honey. - Thank you. - You come around here often? - Just passing through. - Oh, come on now. You can't lie to me. I know better. I've seen you before. - Seriously doubt that. - You ever tasted this? I can tell you you haven't. It's good. - You should enjoy it. - It's better with company. - You have a good night. - If you like to get pushy, I like that too. - Clearly. - Not your type? - Not even close. - Hey, how's that salad? - Surprisingly delicious. - Really? I wouldn't have expected that. - I know, right? I'm guessing we close to all the farms so the produce is fresh. - That makes sense. I'm Dawn. - Micah. - So you see anything good on there? - You know what? Think I'm gonna have what he's having. That'd be great, thank you. Whisky and coke too? - Okay, seriously. That's my go to. - Well make that two then. Put hers on my tab. - You got it. - Why thank you, sir. - No worries. So what brings you to the middle of bum-fuck California? - Just road-tripping from LA to Portland. - Oh yeah? What's up there? - Soak. - Soak? - Soak, the massive festival. It's like the burning man in Oregon, camping, arts, music, all of that kind of stuff. - Okay. It sounds cool. - Yeah, it's pretty cool. It gets kind of crazy though. I'm guessing that you've never been. - To soak? - Yeah. - No. Or burning man for that matter. - Well, I think you definitely gotta check it out. - So you driving up alone? - Yeah. It's just me and my van. I actually built it so that I can pretty much just like live on the road. I am obsessed with traveling. - Yeah? That's interesting. I enjoy traveling myself. I've been making my way around the Midwest, hitting up all the national parks. - You know, nothing beats in open road. - I actually have family in Portland I've been mean in the visit soon. - Okay, I love Portland too. Do you like go often or anything? - Yeah, but plans got put on hold because my truck is in the shop. So stuck here for a bit. - Well, that's a bummer. - Bottoms up. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Well, two adventures on the road. - Cheers to the art are falling apart for those of us who do it so well. Cheers to myself and another and made that other be she who drinks to herself and another and made that other be me. Cheers. - Wow. Very nice sir. - So he ain't the entire cake. - Well, it was a social media challenge. - What? - Just say no, his whole face was like. - Hey guys, we're about to wrap it up. Can I get you anything else? - I'm good. I've got a long drive ahead of me. - Just the check. Thank you. - You got it buddy. - Oh, my god. - Well, that was quite an unexpected encounter. - Likewise. I haven't had a conversation this enjoyed one in a while. - You know what, you should just come with me. - What? - I'll give you a lip to see your family in Portland. No problem. - No, I couldn't impose. - Look, look, it's a done deal. First let's take a selfie so we can remember this moment. - Here, let me. Oh shit, fuck. - Shit. - No, no. - I think it's fried. - I am so sorry. You know what? I'll ride with you to Portland only to get you a new phone when we get there, top of the line, whatever's available. - I mean, you can't say no to top of the line and waterproof would be nice. - You got it. - Okay, deal. I feel like this is like my first time having someone ride with me on a road trip. - Yeah? Feels special. - But you can also keep me awake. - I have a job. - Ooh. - Oh. - Sorry. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm good, I'm good. - Wow. - This is my baby. You like it? Check it out, check it out. - All right. So where are you from originally? - I grew up in the Midwest, Wisconsin. I was raised by a single father. Taught me how to hunt. I slung malts at the dairy bar, yada yada, yada. - Living the dream. - Exactly. What about you? What's your life story buddy? - Definitely not as amazing. I grew up in Chicago and I had a rough childhood. Didn't go to college, not much family to speak of. - Except for the ones in Portland? - Yeah, right. Kinda wanted to turn over new leaf there, you know. Start over. - I get that. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance. - Exactly. - Excuse me. I think I'm gonna have to pull over pretty soon. - What, you need me to drive? - Oh, no. Nobody drives Emily but me. We can just find a place to pull off and we can camp for the night. Got a bed in the back. And I'll set you up in hammock. - Just sleep on the side of the road? - Yeah, I do it all the time and it's quieter than truck stops. Okay, this'll do. - You sure this shit is cool? - There's nobody anywhere around here unless you're afraid of the dark. - I'm sure I can handle it. - Here you go. - Perfect. Actually, haven't been camping in a while. - Well, it's just like riding a bike except we're in nature, and you're asleep. - I guess. - I must say I'm a little ripe. I'm gonna go shower if you don't mind. - You got a shower in that thing too? - Yeah, a camp shower. I just refill the water tank every few days. - Damn, that shit ball as hell. - Thank you. I designed it myself. And check this out. Now we have some tunage. - I'm digging it. - Okay. You mind giving me a little privacy? - Oh, absolutely, I'm sorry. - Hey Micah. You wanna grab us some wood so we can make a little fire? You do know what kindling is, right, city boy? - Stop it. I watch a lot of documentaries in my downtime. It's the little stickies, right? - Yes. Very good. Just little stickies. There's gonna be a headlamp up there. And it's a rape whistle for if you're really worried. Micah? Micah is that you? Micah? Micah, come on, where are you? Micah, what the hell? Micah? - What's up? - Jesus. What the hell was that? - What? The lights? - Where did you run off to? - I went to go get some wood and to take a piss. - Some dude in a Bronco was parked over there. He just took off. - I definitely thought I heard something. - I don't know how you missed it. - Well, I told you this place might not be safe. - So weird. - They probably was just some local farm boy trying to sneak a peak. - Creepers. - Yeah, they're everywhere. - I'm gonna go get dressed. - Good idea. - Night cap? - I do have a motto of never turning down a free drink. - There you go, sir. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You see, this is life. Fuck those city folks and their traffic and that nasty smog. - It definitely could be worse. - Did you see where that guy came from? I didn't even notice him pull up. - I didn't see him at all. - It was creepy. - I'm surprised that's never happened before, being single on the road. - Yeah. I mean, I guess there's a first time for everything. - So they say. - Well, think I've had enough excitement for the night. - What? Come on, you barely took a sip outta your drink. It's early. - Yeah, well I have a long drive ahead of me. I'm out. - Night then. ♪ I like my eggs in the morning ♪ - Good morning, sleepy head. I hope you don't mind, I found some food in you cooler. I made her some breakfast. - You rifled through my stuff? - I'm not sure rifled is the word I would use. - Now who's the creeper? - Compliments of the house, van. - Thank you, monsieur - Not that I have a degree in it or anything, but I've always demanded a good breakfast. - Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. - Absolutely. I must say, you have quite an impressive setup inside of that thing. - How about I give you an official tour? Come on. - Okay. So. - So here we have my bed, which I already put up, of course. And then we have this, it's a bed, but it doubles as a bench. - Nice. - And then we have the kitchen over here, the sink, the fridge. This is where all of my gourmet meals happen. Oh, this here is just storage. You know, just goods, that kind of stuff. - What about that one? - Oh, that's just my secret stash. - I got you. Well, I must say, I am very impressed. - Thanks. It's a start. Soon, we'll be flying into space. - Is that so? - Yeah. Well that's my plan. Get rich, take off into space. That's my destiny, and Emily spinach here is my first class ticket to paradise. - That sounds like one hell of a life. - Everything that I own is in this van. It's just easy. You know. - What if something ever happened to it. - Well, I'll be here to make sure that nothing ever happens to her. - I hope so. - Anyway, we should hit the road. Time's a wasting. - Time you enjoy wasting isn't waste of time. - Is that so? Well, we should waste time cleaning up your mess and I'll go change and we'll hit the road. Okay. - Woo. Old school, huh? - Well, since someone drowned my GPS, luckily I always have a backup. So we should be somewhere around here. We'll have to stop at a gas station around here. Otherwise we'll run outta gas before the next exit. The dots are for the bathrooms just in case you gotta go. And if we stay on task, we should be to Portland at around nine o'clock tonight. - Wow. You got this whole thing mapped out to a T. - Well, I like to stay on task. You gotta take advantage of the world while we're able to, you know. - I guess. I'm not really a big plans type of guy. You know, I like to let the road take me where it takes me. - Huh? Well are ready for Emily to take us where we gotta go? - Let's do it. - Let's do it. ♪ Chronic in my lungs ♪ I'm living with ♪ Toast to the melodies ♪ Exhaling out the smoke ♪ With folks from the 70s ♪ Talking about LSD overload ♪ Got THC up in my chromosomes ♪ Peyote in my belly ♪ I got the dopest flow ♪ Hoes swarming like the locust flow ♪ ♪ Females try and fuck with my focus, bro ♪ ♪ I just say, let it go ♪ Til I'm past the ♪ Puffing hash and smoke ♪ Eating up my enemies like the cannibal ♪ ♪ Marching homies say cannibal ♪ Jumping down rabbit hole with Adderall ♪ ♪ Even though it's sad and all ♪ They still think is radical ♪ Trauma caused me to be an animal ♪ ♪ A strategy unfathomable - I can dig that. I like to think of myself as a free spirit, but I still got plans. Goals and shit. You fuck with goals. - Yeah. Fleeting exceptions pop up time to time. I think we need some music. - Like this this guy took a circular saw and cut off this girl. I mean talking like ankle, knee, thigh, head fingers. It was just so gross. - What the fuck is this? - So messy. - Oh, it's a true crime podcast that I love. It's called "Murder They Wrote", and these two are cool. So basically they talk about famous murders across the country and just... - Seriously into that shit? - Yeah. It's super interesting. - What do you really think is the motive behind this Mechanic Maniac? - I dunno. He's a copycat, wants to be famous. I mean, doesn't everybody wanna be famous now. He wants to be some sort of like household name, like a, I don't know, a Bundy, or a Gacy. He's getting there. Not there yet. - I don't agree. - Okay, I can only take so much of that. - But you've heard of the Mechanic Maniac, right? - I may have heard something. I don't really watch those. - He's killed 13 victims across five states that we know of, guys and girls. He's never been arrested or even close to being caught. He's on his way to being the biggest serial killer in the past decade. Whew. - You seem a little excited about this. - Well, it makes an amazing case study. I had a class where we had to use him for an assignment... - Look, I'm sure he's just a weirdo living in his mom's basement, looking for ways to get his kicks. - Not a chance. This guy's eluded the FBI for almost a decade. It's no... - Okay, so he's watched a couple episodes of CSI and learned a few tricks. Big whoop. Definitely not the kind of person you want to put up in a pedestal. - I get it. You're scared of him, aren't you? Have you had a run in with someone like this or something? - Not that I can recall. And I'm definitely not scared of him. I'm pretty sure there's a rational explanation on why he's going after these kids. - Well, what do you think? - Think what. - What do you think the motive is? If you follow his pattern, he's always trapping a young guy or girl alone in a vehicle where he takes them back to a place. He drugs them and he dismembers them with a circular saw. What's his M.O.? - First off, that shit sounds disgusting. And he's obviously a perv taking advantage of someone alone. - He doesn't take advantage, he just kidnaps. - Either way, he's a sick fuck who takes his aggressions out on randos and definitely should be the front runner for the serial killer of the decade award. - You wanna know what I think? - Enlighten me. - I think he's a genius, Harvard level craftsman. I think he's a master and I think he's gonna keep killing until he finally finds the piece that he's looking for. - What the fuck, Dawn? I think you might wanna try some lighter reading options for a bit, some Sunday funnies or some shit. Turn off the history channel, enjoy some junk food TV. Jesus. - Come on. You sound jealous of the attention. - The fuck that's supposed to mean? Why would I be jealous of a fucking serial? - I'm just kidding. Change the subject. What do you wanna talk about? Oh my god, I think someone's following us. That's the Bronco that was spying on me last night. - What? Hell no, no way. - Let's see if he tries to turn. Yeah, it's definitely him. He's following us. - Oh, you definitely need to drive faster then. What the fuck? - Shit. My van! - Come on, we gotta get away from this fucking asshole. - That's what I'm trying to do. Okay, hang on Emily. Are we good, are we good? - No, he coming back. Fuck. That's the Mechanic Maniac. - What? - I'm about to jump out. - What? - I'm about to jump out. What the fuck? - You gonna have to let me out, you gonna have to let me out. Just pull over and let me out. Just pull over and let me the fuck out. Please. - You have to calm down, okay. - Oh, I'm having a panic attack. - Come on man, you have to drive faster. - It's a living space, not a fucking Lamborghini. Okay, hold on to something. He can't be serious right now. - We gotta get the fuck outta here. I think, I think we lost him. I think we may. We lost him. - Are we good? - We lost him. - Okay. - Oh shit. - Okay. - Oh, that was insane. - Dude, we need to call 911. Someone just tried to kill us with a fucking truck. - Hardly, that was just some idiot driver. We probably cut him off at some point and pissed him off. - Take your phone out right now and dial 911. I'll stop at the next exit and we can get somebody after this crazy idiot. - I can't do that. - Why the fuck not? - I don't have a phone. - Everyone carries a cell phone. - Apparently they don't. - Please pray tell explain to me why on earth you don't have a cell phone. - Well, have you heard anything about the 5G thing? - For fuck sake. - Yes, I'd heard and did research... - You seriously don't have a cell phone, Micah, so don't... - No, I don't have no cell phone! - You seriously don't have a phone? - No I don't. - Well, I had a phone until you took it swimming last night. Now we're fucking totally screwed. - No, we just need to keep driving. There's no way that man is gonna get out of that ditch anytime soon. - What happened back there? You totally pussed out. - What the fuck was I supposed to do? That man was attacking us with a goddamn car! - Do something. Anything. God. - Yeah, okay. Un-fucking-believable. - Maybe you're right. Maybe I did something that pissed him off. - See? Maybe so. What if it was some Mechanic Maniac? - Not a chance. He doesn't kill people while he's driving. He's not the fast and furious type. - Yeah, well you said it yourself. There's a first time for everything. - Ah shit. We gotta stop for gas. - What? No. - Micah, I told you before that there's only one gas station between here and the next 70 miles or so. We're low. Besides, you can run in and call the cops. I'm sure it's no 5G in there. - Dawn, this shit looks fucking abandoned. - Yeah, you're right. It's like the perfect place to get murdered. So run inside and call the cops. - All right. - Quick like a bunny. - Okay, damn. - Shit. Micah. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Micah? - Nuts? - Micah, what are you doing? - I was getting snacks, but I don't see anybody here. - Somebody's here all right, and they're driving the Bronco. - You gotta be kidding me. - And what happened to calling the cops? - I didn't see a phone. Do you see this place? I don't even think they have running water. What are we gonna do? - We gotta stay out of sight. Shit. I think he's gonna get that old lady. - Well, maybe that'll distract him so we can get away. - Dude, are you serious? - What else do you have in mind? - We need a distraction. - A distraction? - Let's just go. - What are you? Okay. Hurry up, go, go, go. I told you we should have never came to this damn gas station. Keep low. Come on. - Shit. - Oh my god. - Wait, watch my back. - I didn't see him. - He definitely won't miss this. You got a lighter? - No. - What? - I don't smoke. - Get up. - Where you going? Dawn, where the fuck are you? - Hey, get ready to run. - What are you doing? No! - What the hell? - Don't you know that gas doesn't burn like that? Only the fumes are flammable. - Seriously? - It's basic science. - Shit. Fuck science. Hey, come on. - Fuck. - I gotta do somethin'. Hold on, hold on, hold on. - Micah! Shit. - Come on, fly this motherfucker. Start the damn car. Come on. - Banana in the tailpipe? That's your master plan? - Hey, it worked in "Beverly Hills Cop". - I must have missed that one. - It's a fucking classic. - It better work, otherwise he's gonna be behind us in like two seconds. - Oh, I promise you I'll work better than that trail of gas explosion would. - Hey, I'm pretty sure that's from a movie too. - Yeah, well if you watch "MythBusters"... Oh shit. - And now he's shooting at us. - Who the fuck is this asshole? - Where is he? - I don't know, he's fucking behind us. - Oh fuck! - Oh shit! - Fuck! - Shit! - What the fuck! - Micah, take the wheel. - Huh? - Just grab the fucking wheel. - Oh, this isn't very safe. - It's safer than... - What is that? Please don't that, don't do that. - Close your eyes, close your eyes. - Oh my god. - Nobody shoots at my van, bitch. You can open your eyes now. Are you serious? - Didn't you just shoot him with a flare gun? - Any port in a storm, my friend. - Oh yeah, your ass is crazy. - Hey! - All of you are fucking insane. - I almost had to pull out the paper towels for you to piss in your pants. - I don't think we're quite there yet, thanks. - Close enough. - Oh, I don't think it's over! What do we do, what do we do? - I don't know. - Wait. He's slowing down. Holy shit. The banana. Once again, cinema saves us from the most disastrous situation. - Incredible. How the hell? - How the hell, I told you she was gonna work.

I had an idea where we can get even further away from that mechanic. There it is. It's a back road. It'll still get us to Portland in time, but it'll keep us off the highways. Hopefully leaving that asshole behind. What the hell do you think he's after? - Well, if it is the mechanic, you definitely fit his victim requirement. - Not at all. All of his prey are consistently found solo, kidnapped in a vehicle, and taken to a specific place for torture and mutilation. Wouldn't even make sense for him to go after somebody on an open road, especially not with a gun. - Well, why the fuck is he following us, Dawn? Who are you? - Who am I? I'm nobody. Who the fuck are you? Maybe you are the one he's after. - I don't know about that. And why the fuck are we not taking the highway? - We wanna keep away from the highway to stay away from that asshole. - Seems a little sketchy to me. - Well, if you want, I can drop you off right here. You'd be a sitting dick. - You mean duck. - No I didn't. - Whatever. And if it is the mechanic, then all bets off. - - This doesn't fit his M.O. - Maybe it's a copycat, some killer on the prow where he can only kill people with his fucking car. - Mechanic's too smart for that. There's gotta be something else he's after. - Maybe you the fucking mechanic for all I know. - Good one. - Why is he after you Dawn? Seriously, tell me. - Fuck you, dude. I have no idea who this douche bag is. And frankly, I don't appreciate the accusations. - Speaking of Portland, I did get this for you when we were at the gas station. - That was sweet. - So you said your father was a hunter. What kind of stuff did he hunt? - White tailed deer mostly, occasional fox, black bear. - Hunting a bear would be crazy. - Yeah. - Come on, what the fuck now? - I don't know. I think it's the engine. - From our run in with the mechanic, you think? - Maybe. - I'm gonna have to check it out. - Oh man, what the fuck. - We need to pull off over here. - One thing after another, literally. Come on, Dawn, the fuck. How bad is it? - Looks pretty bad. Think I blew a hose. - I don't know anything about cars. - Well, it's a van, so it's a difference. - Vans either. - Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be able to fix this. - What do you mean? We need to get back on the road? - Well, we can't if the van won't run. - How did I even end up in this situation? I gotta just stay my ass at that damn bar. - Calm down. Look, the highway is only a couple of miles that way. If we hike it, we can find a car, flag it down and call AAA. It's not a big deal. - I feel like every element of this fucking trip has been a big deal. - Jesus, get a hold of yourself. It'll be darken an hour. So we need to get a move on, okay. - I don't think we should leave the van. - Well, we don't have a choice. - Fuck! - Wait! - What? - Look. - Oh shit! - I'd recognize those traps anywhere. That's a bear trap. These are hunting woods. - Yeah, well I'm definitely not walking through those woods now. The fuck. - Well, Micah, we don't have a choice. We have to go. - Can this day possibly get any worse. - You hear that? - Oh. Come on, we gotta get away from that psycho! Come on. Get up. Start running. Run. - I'm coming. Shit. - Run, run, run, please run, run, run. Oh my god run. This is bullshit. What's the plan? What's the fucking plan? - Wait. - Wait for what? To get fucking creamed? - Just trust me. Wait. Come on, big boy. Come and get us. - I figured it out. You're psychotic. Yes. - Not yet. - Dawn, you better leave me the fuck... - Not yet. - Oh my god. Oh! - Now! - Lord have mercy. - See, told you to follow me. - Okay, Dawn. Let's go. - Not yet. Need to see who this psychopath is first. - Are you nuts, who cares? Let's get back to the van. - Not yet. Who is this? I think he's dead. - Get back here! - Shit. - Get back here. Oh, you think it's a game, huh. Yeah. I can see you. Get out here! I see you. Get out here now! - What do you want with us? - I don't want you sweetheart. You fine. It's him. - What did he do? - Oh. Oh, you ain't tell your little girlfriend? Huh? You ain't tell her what you did? You sick son of bitch. Words can't describe what he did. - Sir, I think you got the wrong guy. I ain't never seen your old ass before. - Oh, you right. You know what? Whew. I am getting old, but see you, you ain't gonna get that chance 'cause I'm gonna kill your black ass today, motherfucker. Get back over here! Oh, okay. I see what it is. - Hunter's woods. Hide behind there, keep your ass quiet, okay. Go, go, go. Look man, please, please don't shoot, okay. I don't want any trouble. - And I told you I'm not here for you. I want him. - Okay, just be cool. Nobody has to get shot. Okay. - And I don't wanna shoot you, but I will if I have to. So I'm not gonna ask you again. Where is he? - Look, I swear I have no clue where he is. I don't know. Okay. - So he just left you, huh? - Yeah. - Some cold shit. How you just gonna leave your girl like that? Told you he wasn't shit. End of the line. Oh shit! Oh! - Oh shit. - Fuck! - Oh, bravo. You really fucking caught him. - You gotta get me down. I can't help you if you if, if don't let me the fuck down. - Why are you following us? - I told you. I'm not following you. I want him. - Shut your crazy ass up. Dawn, let's go. - But why? Are you the Mechanic Maniac? - No. No. He's the maniac. - What? - No. This has motherfucker is nuts. We need to go. - Dawn. Dawn, is your name. Dawn, you gotta listen to me. He killed my only son. He killed my boy Jamie. - Fuck you, old man. I ain't kill nobody. His ass is lying, Dawn. Let's go. What the fuck? - You son of a bitch, I saw you drag him off. I saw you that night. And I was following your ass ever since. Hunting you. - Micah, Micah, what is he talking about? - You know me, it's bullshit. I don't know. What the fuck? - Dawn, you don't know him. Dawn. What are you doing? What are you doing? No. Dawn, you gotta let me down. You gotta shot him or he's gonna kill you next. He'll kill you next. - Dawn, shoot him, he's clearly the maniac. - Dawn, please baby girl, listen to me. My name is Anthony. I'm a father who lost his son at the hands of this murderer. He killed my boy, Jamie. Shoot him before he kills you. - Fuck what he talking about, Dawn. Pay attention to me. He's fucking lying. Kill him. He hurt Emily. What the fuck, shoot him. - Emily? Who the fuck is Emily? What the fuck are you doing? - He got a gun! - What a fucking day. Oh Jesus. You did the right thing, Dawn. You did the right thing. That motherfucker was just trying to kill us. You just saved my life. All right? Let's get back to the van. - No. - What did you just say? - I said, no. We need to take that way and go back to the highway. - I'm pretty sure we agreed to go back to the van. - The van is toast. We have no choice but to go to the highway and flag someone down. - Nope. We can't do that. - What is wrong with you? We only have one option. - You're right. And it's following my directions or else. - Or else what? - Or else I'm gonna butcher you exactly like how did his fat ass son. - What? - You're not much of a criminalist are you? Riding around with a serial killer for hours with no fucking clue. You might wanna find another profession. - No. - Yeah. Shit. Poor Anthony. You just killed an innocent man in cold blood. At least that's what I'll tell the police. I mean your prints are all over the murder weapon. It'll be, you know, an open shut case. - You're a monster. - No, no, not quite, not quite. I think the word that you used was genius. And I appreciate that, but don't put me on a pedestal. I'm not one of those guys who has infatuation killing homeless people or it's like prostitutes and privileged kids. None of that. I, I just enjoying killing motherfuckers, preferably slicing and dicing they ass up. You like, I don't know, like maybe the sound just fuck with me. I don't know, it does something to me. - You're a sick fuck. - So? You listen to me or shit is gonna get a lot messier than this. - What the fuck are you gonna do, Micah? You gonna shoot me? - Dawn. Don't insult me. You know, I have never killed anyone with a gun. Ever, I mean. What's the fun in that? That's no fun. So, let's get back to the van. - I said no. - March, bitch. Bye, Anthony. - I get it, you know. I see why we have to go back to the van. - You don't see shit. Shut up and march. - I've read your file. You can't kill me. You only kill your victims in cars. That's why you need to go back to the van. - Bitch, who the fuck do you think you're talking to? I can kill your ass right here on the spot. - Hm? What is it about cars that turn you on? Is it the smell of the leather? Oh no, I bet it's the rumble of the engine, huh? - You don't know what the fuck you talking about. Let's go. - It's your trap, isn't it. Or at least that's how you see it. I mean, they're trapped inside of a small little box. You catch them and then you take them apart. It's like ripping wings off of a fly. - Just shut the fuck up and march! - Someone trap you inside of a box or a room? Did they take you apart to, Micah? - Dawn, if you use that tongue with me again, I'm going to cut it out. - You're gonna have to catch me first. - Fuck! - Hunter's woods. Did you forget, genius? - Oh God, I'm turn you in the buckets. - Wait, what's that? - Oh my god. - Wait, huh? I can't hear you over that bitch ass crying. Little pussy. Can't hear you. - I swear God, I'm gonna fucking kill you. - Come and find me! - Micah. Micah. - Oh, I'm gonna kill ya. Oh, I'm gonna kill ya. Oh fuck. Dawn, get your bitch ass back here man. Dawn, get your ass back here. - Shit. Come on. - There's no need for that. I'm right here. - Wow, you look like shit. - Hmm. Thank you. But you know, Dawn, it's enough of these fucking games. Get your motherfucking ass back to the fucking van right now! - You're right. I'm tired of this game too. - That thing is not gonna kill me, Dawn. - I'm counting on it. Let's play a different game now. - You stupid bitch. - Here's a little gift to help even out the odds, Micah. - Okay, Dawn, I'll play your idiotic game. Stupid bitch. Okay, Dawn. All right. I'll play your fucking idiotic game. - Can you find me? I knew it was you, murderer. - Come out, come out wherever you are. - I'm right here. Micah. - Oh, I'm gonna kill this bitch. - Micah, where am I? - Now where for fuck are you? - I'm everywhere. I was there when you napped Jose Keller after his 16th birthday party. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Micah. I was there when you drug a barely conscious Brook Thompson through the Hickory Creek woods after her second date with the dude named Brad. - No fucking way. Fuck! - I'm well aware of who you are and what you've done. I was there the night you butchered Jamie Miller with the reciprocating saw. Before catching up with you at the truck stop. - Bring your punk ass out here. - I carefully built that fun obstacle course in the nearby was woods here. - Come on. - I wasn't lying about my father being a trapper. He definitely taught me everything I needed to know. I knew you liked to frequent that bar. So it was easy for me to find you. I was well aware you didn't keep a phone so you couldn't tracked. We could take a selfie so we can capture this moment. - Fuck. - I figured you wouldn't let me keep mine either. So I let you destroy it. It was just a backup. Don't worry. My selfies are safe. - Come on, come on. - Murderer. - Come on, bitch. - Where am I? - Move your ass. - Find me. - Come on! - Micah. Fuck! Fuck! - I was impressed by the gadget you built to open the air bags in Jamie's car. So I designed one of my own to help stop the engine in the van. - Come on, what the fuck now? - I don't know. I think it's the engine. I do have to say that vengeful stunt that the driving father pulled was a surprise. Now I didn't plan on it. Definitely made sitting this trap a little more challenging, but thankfully I could prove to myself that I could adapt in a quick, decisive way. I had an idea of who he might be when I saw that bobble head on his dashboard at the bar. You didn't notice of course, details Micah details. Then I knew who he was when I saw a picture of him and Jamie in his wallet. Poor guy. But he had to go. - Where you at, Dawn? Where you at? So all this for little ole me, huh Dawn? You really shouldn't have. - Oh no, it needed to be done. - I really do like you, Dawn. - Finally. I was wondering when your bitch ass was gonna catch up. - Oh, don't worry about nothing. You gonna get the full mechanic experience now bitch. Uh uh, no you don't. Ah, shit. Yeah. - Okay. Hold on a second. Micah, don't be a pussy. You wanna fight hand to hand? Yeah? Come on. - Rest in peace, Dawn. What the fuck? - Oh, you didn't know I was Bulletproof, huh? - What the fuck is wrong with you? Ah, shit. No, no. Yeah. - You fucking idiot. - Bitch. I guess I'm the idiot who kicking your fucking ass, huh? - Yeah, it hurts, doesn't it. Sweetie, the trap doesn't work until the animal is caught, right? Maybe it's time to spring this one. Hey, there's sleepy head. You had a nice nap. - Dawn. You better let me off this fucking table right now, so help me, God. - Oh Micah, I am your god. I hope this all outfits more comfortable. - Untie me right fucking now. What the fuck is that? - Oh, Micah, you were such a fucking disappointment. With all of the experience you have sawing your victims, I thought you'd be able to name this baby by the make and model. - Dawn. Dawn. Dawn. Just listen to me, Dawn. Just listen to me, okay. Please don't do this. Dawn, please. Please. Dawn, I would do anything please. - Just let it out. Just follow the pattern. - I, Dawn, I will do anything. I will do anything, Dawn, please. Please, just let me go. - Is that what Jamie said? Or Brooke? I know that's what Melanie said. Cause I was there for that too. She was my best friend and you took her from the Circle K parking lot in Waupaca, Wisconsin at 2:22 in the morning while I happened to go inside for an energy drink. - Please. Please, stop. - Came outside to an empty car and I saw a man jump into his nearby. It was your second kill, if I remember correctly. You were a lot sloppier in those days. But I never stopped. - Dawn, just, just. - And I won't stop now. - Okay please. Dawn. Dawn. You ain't gotta be like me, Dawn. Just let me go, please. No, stop it, please. Please stop, stop! Dawn. Dawn. Dawn, Dawn. Come here, Dawn. Dawn, look at me. Dawn. Dawn. Do it, bitch. - Megan McCormick coming to you live from TV 13, a grizzly site today at the old Chenworth barn.
