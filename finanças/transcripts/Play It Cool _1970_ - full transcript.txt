A DAIEI PRODUCTION Honey. Come on! Get off me. You really love it a lot. It isn't bad, is it? Hey. Hey! Turn over! No! Stop rousing me. I can't help it. I'm working to earn money, so I drank a lot. I'm not in the mood! What have you been doing all day? Gambling on bicycle races? The horses? You must be tired after work. - Go to sleep for god's sake. - Shut up! Yumi is still awake. PLAY IT COOL Produced by Kosuke Seki Based on the Novel by Masayuki Toyama Screenplay by Yoshihiro Ishimatsu Yasuzo Masumura Photographed by Setsuo Kobayashi Music by Hikaru Hayashi Starring Mari Atsumi Yusuke Kawazu Ko Nishimura Ryoichi Tamagawa Tomoo Nagai Sanae Nakahara Tomoko Mayama Akemi Negishi Directed by Yasuzo Masumura Sorry, I overslept again. Breakfast is ready. Thanks. He's pathetic! He became an insurance salesman, because he doesn't want to work. A man shouldn't be like that. So you hate him? Love... hate... not like that. Better than no man. You better leave him. What? Don't say that again! It's none of your business! How about you? Relax. Be careful... of cars. Lots of cars at this hour. KITANO SEWING SCHOOL Yumi, join us at a group date party. No. I don't have money. You're pretty, guys will pay for you. Join a group date once in a while! I hate men. She's strange as usual. Just leave her alone. I don't want this... oh? Now watch me. I win! I'm out! I'm just unlucky. Can't help it. So it's 3,000? Pay up now. I'm home. Welcome home. Oh no! I'm running late. Yumi. Why don't you go have fun? You're home so early. Mom would be worried. Who do you think you are? But she's grown a lot these days. When I first met her, she's just a homely schoolgirl. Now she's like a Western woman. - Guys chase you around, right? - My first love... gave me this precious kid when I was a teenager. She won't be like me. I'll have her marry a proper salary man. She should have a reliable man. Idle talk. I'll find someone for her. Won't be someone like you. Let's go to a hotel. OK. BAR "TOUCH" You pervert! Let me go! Oh! Now no one wants me. Make him drink more! Beer! Hey! Stop drinking like mad! I'm talking to her. Now get lost! You don't have to lose your temper. I'm still an attractive woman. Touch me and you'll see. Tomi! This is my client! Stop it! What's wrong with that? I don't mean to compete with you. Examine my body. Any spot you like. Just explore me. Tomi. Oh, Madame. A word with you. What's the matter? You're a pest. Am I? I'm trying my best to push up business. It's just because... you weren't there so I had to try harder. That's my gratitude to you. I thank you for that. - But don't overdo it. - I know. But I'm fed up with this. We were co-workers at the same bar. Now you're my Madame. It's not fair. Given your looks and body, you should have made it, not me. But you fall in love too easily. I can't help it! Without a man to love, life is not worth living. But you indulged your man. He got all your money, then dumped you. Your current man doesn't seem right, what are you going to do? I'm a fool for your love... I'm used to that. It'd be OK this time. He's useless but he's sweet. He'll marry me. I'm not young now. I really should settle down. What are you sewing? A dress for our neighbour. You don't need to earn money now. We're not lacking anything, I've not had much luck recently. I'd like to buy you a dress or two. If I hit the jackpot. No thanks. You've been on that sewing machine since last night. Don't ruin your health for work. Let's play some poker. You only like gambling, don't you? Nothing else interests me. You're good at this? I guess I can't beat you. Your mother isn't good. Here's 100 yen. We'll settle later. Pick a card. Five. Nine. I go first. Wild card. Five. 200. Cut. 400. Yes. One. One? Here's three! What are you doing? Keep quiet! The neighbours will hear us. I don't mind, but think of your mom. She'll be sad. No! Thank you so much. You bought me sushi, then gave me a ride. OK, just get off. Yes! I'm in your way. Have fun and be good to each other. Good night! What a pest. I didn't ask her in, she even made me buy sushi! She's like that. When she was young, she fleeced her clients. Taking free taxi rides. She shouldn't be too greedy. I'm home. Welcome home. Yumi. These sushi look delicious. Come eat. Yumi! I feel bad. I'm drunk. What a cool daughter. Yumi, get over here. What's wrong with you? Anything you're unhappy with? Come here! Mom. Leave this man. Leave him? That again? Stubborn girl. Leave him! Stop it. That's not up to kids to say. You're a virgin, you won't understand. Leave him. Why do I have to leave him? Tell me why. I can't. Honey. What's wrong with her? How would I know? OK then. He... - He did to me what he did to you. - No... By force. Stop that bullshit! I'm not a virgin anymore. Bullshit. - That's impossible... - Really. A lie! It must be a lie! Honey. That wasn't true? That can't be true, right? It didn't happen? I can't help it. We live in the same house. I didn't mean to let you know. But... I just can't help it. But you promised you won't lay hands on her! You can't satisfy me! It's your fault! Why did you do such a thing! How dare you rape my dear daughter! Get out! Get out? Fine. I'm fed up with you anyway. Suit yourself! Yumi, it's also your fault. Why did you let him? He hit me. I lost consciousness. What are you saying! Yumi, leave your mother. Come with me! You must be joking! You won't take her away. She's my woman. It's up to me. I'll work hard and give you a good life. Let's go. No! You're coming with me! Let go of her! Fool. That's not funny. Mom! Stab me if you can. Other than me, who'd have wanted you, old hag? No! Bitch! So I did it. Mom! Go to the police. But Yumi, don't say he raped you. People will talk. I'll tell it all. And how you defended me. Fool! BAR HOSTESS KILLS COMMON-LAW HUSBAND "After an argument, a bar hostess killed a salesman with a kitchen knife." A cigarette? Lucky that you can be bailed. All thanks to you talking... to that detective. The interrogation... It was really tough. I'm home. Mom. Are you alright? I'm OK. Must be tough on you. People gossiping. How long can you stay home? Until the trial is over. After the sentence they'll send me to prison. How long? Hmm... I might be out in a couple of years. Tomi, first you have to... decide on Yumi's future. Whatever. We have no relatives. No savings. I can help. Really? I caused so much trouble, and you'll take care of her. So nice. Don't mention it. We're old pals. Right. What a relief. Madame is like a sister to me. She's a really fine person. Always helping me. If a woman has good looks, she has everything. I've noticed her for a long time. She'd be popular. You want her to be a hostess? Yes. She looks so much like you in your youth. She'll be our top hostess. You must be joking! I won't let her work with you. You can't force us! Sorry, but you actually like sex! Now you've forgotten what I've done for you? I won't go back to your bar. Get out! Fine. So the bail money, and all the money you owe me... - give it back. - I'll pay back all the money... and it's over between us! Who does she think she is? So arrogant. I wish I didn't trust her. Mom. I'll go to work. Where? I'll take a job at a decent company. That isn't bad. Better than her bar. My plan was to get you married after you finish sewing school. It's all my fault. My foolishness. Sorry, Yumi. Hello. Please come again. We'll serve you well. Welcome. - Thank you. - A full house after a long while. We're grateful to you. Please enjoy. No thanks. I heard there's a nice new girl. Let me see her. Yumi. Yes? That's the girl. Mr. Kazama has been taking care of us. Oh, she's really good. - Bye then. - Bye. Go back. Now tell me what you think. - Marrying you? - Yes! I'm serious. I'm definitely not a liar. Believe me! So you love me that much? Over this week, I'm convinced that you're so good. Let me rescue you from this lousy place! But I've only just started here. What about Madame? To hell with her! I have a decent job! I'll make you happy. Let's get married. Let's have a happy family. But how shall I tell my mother? Where's your mother? - In the countryside. - Countryside? Tochigi. So let's drive there this Sunday. We'll ask for her approval. - Welcome. - Fill it up. I enjoy a drive. It's so chilled. Let's go around Japan after we get married. What's your mother doing in the countryside? She's a farmer? She's doing nothing. You're supporting her? Not really. Is it a long way from here? We're almost there. We're here. But it's the prison. My mom is living in it. - As a prisoner. - A prisoner? She still has two years of jail term. - What did she do? - Murder. She killed a man with a kitchen knife. She'd be so glad! You're serious with me, and work in a nice firm. Let's go in. Wait. Why? You don't want me because my mom is a killer? No. But I got to discuss it with someone. Now tell me. Do you want to marry me or not? Let me think it over. I'm willing to marry you. Tell me now. I can't. I really can't! So it's true. Men are unreliable. The man killed by my mom was also like that. She killed him because he raped me. - What! - Go home! I'm my mom's daughter. You won't understand our bonds! Yumi! You got pretty. You've changed a lot from the last time. So good to be young. - How are you? - I'm comfortable here. Work isn't tough and I get to eat. Have you found a job? I'm working every day. I'm so sorry for you. Surely they look down on you? I'm a killer. Don't worry, only Madame knows it. - Madame? - Bar Touch. So she really made you do it! Quiet! I am me, you are you. You've already suffered. How come you let her convince you? No. I asked her to take me. You can't! How low are you going to fall? What is she going to do to you? I made a lot of money. All those legal fees. I can only pay Madame back by working there. Shut up! I don't want to hear! You just relax when you get out of here. I'll make the money. I don't need your money. Just leave me alone. Thank you very much! Fixing your hair? Yes. You're at work very early. I clean the premises. Have you get used to this work? No. Not yet. It's not easy to be a hostess. I can teach you a lot, but let's talk somewhere. Have a cup of tea at my bar. Won't take long. Here. Go in. Go in! Bro. Nice job. No fuss! No one will hear you. What do you want? To make you my woman. Very nice body. No violence! Do this nicely. I don't want to play it rough. Let's be amicable. Not here. I feel shy here. As you wish... come here. Go upstairs. Here? I think here is alright. After I became your woman, what then? You'll work here starting tonight. In return, I'll treat you well every night. OK. I'll do anything. - Give me a drink. - A drink? I don't feel anything without alcohol. I need it a lot. For sex. What a girl! Hello. Police? She's meek. I thought she'd resist some more. Now women are like that. They love sleeping with men. A bar hostess... must be taken care of by a good man. If you're my woman... As this area is my turf, you can't really make it on your own. Lots of men would lay their hands on you. You need protection. - Drink up. - Yes. It's nice. I want more. How much can you drink? Such a nice body. Didn't know you can drink so much. More. Bro! Help! You called the police? He forced me here. Arrest him. How dare you! Welcome. Hey you! You hear me? How dare you! You disgraced my bro! You're asking for this! Yumi! Apologize now! Thanks to you, he got into trouble. You must make it up to him! Mr. Kazama, I'll teach her well, please don't bother her again tonight. Madame, should you keep her here? It's bad for business. Give her to me. We'll talk about it later. Hey you. Whisky and water. Welcome. Give me a cigarette. You stay out of this. Tonight, please take this as apology. 50,000? I'll accept for your sake. We'll come again. Think it over! Madame, sorry for the fuss. I'm so sorry for causing you trouble. Let's have a word. If they come every night, your clients will run away. End of business. I know, but what could I do? Let me take care of the girl. We'll pay you well. Take me to your place. Come in. Your folks? My mom is in the countryside. So you live alone. Sorry to have you pay up for me. How should I thank you? Go to bed? No need. I talked to your Madame, you'll work at my bar. Paulownia Club in Ginza. I'm its manager, my name is Nozawa. Ginza, that's nice. Yes. Get some stuff of yours. Too many yakuzas in this place. I'll have a place for you. This apartment building is nice. Then work hard to earn this. Oh, it's you? I found her in a sleazy bar. She's your Madame from now on. Go in. - Guys like her type. - She has character. Good material. She'll sleep here tonight. Teach her well. I'll find her a place tomorrow. Thanks. You always brought me fine girls. You staying tonight? No. I'm going. Tomorrow then. Don't forget. Fix her hair and makeup. Make her stand out. Listen to her and you'll be a Ginza hostess from tomorrow. I can't believe this! You've got so much prettier! I switched to a bar in Ginza. Club Paulownia. Wow! That sounds gorgeous. I've been a bar hostess for 15 years but I never worked in Ginza. What matters is that you do better than me. I'm earning 50,000 a month. I might even make 100,000, 200,000. But be careful with the clients. If you fall in love and give them your body voluntarily, you lose. And you get dumped. Firstly, don't fall in love. You'll be distracted at work. Relax. I won't be like you. Fool! That's not funny. CLUB PAULOWNIA Welcome. Mr. Kada, what's the matter? The new girl you brought in, where is she? The innermost box. I like you very much! I'm struck! That sounds very serious! Oh you've read my mind! Madame's thinking dirty. Sorry! Please excuse me. I'd love to get to know you the whole night! Mr. Kada, thanks for coming. Don't mind me. Tend to the clients. Yes. Welcome. Very nice move. Snatching Yumi. Let's talk outside. Where is she? I'm taking her back. Hey you. What? - Which family are you from? - The Kitaes. I drank with your boss several times. We'll settle this with your family. You stay out of it. Excuse me. My greetings to you. - Sorry to bother you. - Well then... I'm going. May I spend the night with Yumi? Yes, but Mr. Takasaki, that girl is so unrefined. I want to try something different for a change. Please fix it for me. Hey you! I'll give you a ride. I'm so glad! Taking the train again? Taxi costs 600 yen. What a waste. You're stingy. Mr. Nozawa, you said you're single? Are you marrying Madame? Ah... what can I say? How's your home like? Show me. I want to know all about you. Please! Fantastic! So many books! They're all difficult law books? I was a lawyer. Lawyer? - Why did you quit? - I was forced to quit. It's good to be a lawyer. But I was debarred. Why were you debarred? Never mind that. Now I'm a club manager, that's all. Lousy job. I'd like a cigarette. Actually, your client tonight, Mr. Takasaki, wants to sleep with you. - With me? - He's an executive at a large firm. What to do? No! That's disgusting. Of course not. No? I'm in a fix. Mr. Nozawa. You think I should sleep with him? He's a big client of ours. He spends 1 million every month. I don't want to upset him. I see. You saved my life. I can't refuse. You don't have to. Because I love you. - Really? - That's why I took you to Ginza. Really? Let's decide it by poker. Poker? If I lose, I'll sleep with him. If I win, I get 30,000. - Isn't it a great idea? - Right. If I must sell my body, I don't want to sell it cheaply. Must be for a good price. If it's a dumb client, just say no. - Let's go now? - Where to? Your new apartment. I want to stay at my old place. Rent is cheap. You're so stingy. Let's go! Kicking me out? I want to stay the night here. I'm the manager. Shouldn't sleep with a hostess, even if I like her. Shouldn't touch the merchandise. That's crap. What a let down. Good night. Don't go. At least, until I fall asleep. Why? I'm lonely. I'm OK at the club, but at home I'm all alone. I have no one. No friends. No men. Come. Over here. What? I don't even know my father. I wonder what he looks like. It'd be great if he's like you. So warm. Holding your hand, I'll fall asleep right away, When I do, go home. Who'll lock up? Keep this extra key. Lock up and go home. Four. Straight. Flush. Yumi won again! You're good, you show your skills bit by bit. You've already lost 150,000. She's awesome. Please stop! It makes no difference. I'll go on until I win. Gamble to sleep with her. So creepy. By poker, it doesn't matter. You love her! Slept already? My lover is... you. Now I win! Yumi, you're mine tonight! Excuse me. Go now. Welcome. Welcome. Madame, Yumi is so awful! Her price for a night is 150,000. Five times the going rate! It's 8 o'clock already. Don't be late for work. It was fun last night. I've been sleeping with spa hostesses, but I never had someone like you. What's so good with me? You're so accommodating, your service is perfect. You did anything I wanted, said no to nothing. You were expensive, but worth every penny. That's embarrassing. Perhaps I'm so big-hearted. I treat clients as lovers. I can give you 200,000 per month. Be my woman. I hate to be a concubine! How about 50,000 per night? No. Beat me at poker, and I'll sleep with you. Deciding like this is bothersome! Still, we'll do this my way. Yumi, we know when you played with Mr. Inoue and Mr. Takasaki, you lost on purpose. Sleeping with anyone who beat you at poker. You're a whore! So cheap! This is not a slum bar. It's Ginza. You're shameless! Sleeping with my client with no scruples! Say something! - Welcome. - Welcome. Oh welcome, sir! Please come with me. You're the one who offers your body for poker? Sounds interesting. No need to waste time persuading you. I might even have you for free. I wish to try my luck. Cards! Yes. Madame, you better stop her. You brought her here, so make her stop this trick. But the clients like it. I don't care, tonight's the last night. This is not a gambling bar. You scared me! You're so happy. Tonight I won every game. Four games, 120,000 yen. So no need to go to hotel tonight? That small-firm owner came with full confidence. But he quit, saying he wouldn't pay anymore. Good to hear that. Let's go dancing. My treat. I know a good place. What's wrong? - Let's get out of here. - No! I only get to see old men at the club. Someone will beat me. Then I must sleep with him. I'm tired! Mr. Nozawa. I love you. Very much! I want to steal you from Madame. If I don't dance, I can't hold it back. I must vent it! Dance. Excuse me! We're in a hurry, please hurry. Thanks for waiting. Eat before the noodles get soggy. Such a positive kid. Really? Do you really think so? Despite not having a father... My mom cherishes me. You have to sleep with men, but don't complain. Because I do it for my mom. And I have someone I love, that's you. But could you stop the poker games? Madame isn't happy. That's bad. Then I can't earn money. I get it! I can't do it at the club, right? - I'll do it outside. - Outside? Hotels or inns. Mr. Nozawa. You must know some good places. Tell me. Take my clothes off. All of them. - Not staying again? - Right. No! Stay! You just said I'm a good girl. You forgot? I'm leaving! Please don't go! No! - You must? - Yes! Where would you sleep? Your home? Never mind that. I know. At Madame's. Yes. All night long? Until dawn? Of course. Right. I'm so stupid. Stupid! How stupid I am! Now I can't sleep. Never mind. Go now. Go! I'll sleep alone. I said go! Go now! Get out! Good night. It's tough being Madame. I can only relax when I sleep with the man I love. Hey, when are you marrying me? You're a strange woman. You have lots of good guys to choose from. Rich guys are all old. They're bad in bed. They can't satisfy me. I'm bored. Manager? Just a brothel keeper. I'm tired of living off women. Well, I'm a brothel madame, that makes us a pair. When will we get married? Don't rush things. You're stalling me again. When life changes, things also change. It's hard to figure what to do. I'm fed up being a Madame now. I want to strike out on my own. Let's start a place? What you mean is I should become a lawyer again? Getting up now? It's still early. I'm taking Yumi and a client to a hotel. Poker game. You really care about her. You danced with her last night? Stop being jealous. I'm not interested in her. Really? If you cheat I won't forgive you. Two. Three. You may go now. I'll stay until the games are over. We're arresting you for gambling! This isn't gambling. Just playing. Playing? Then how about this money? He wishes to sleep with her, so he gave this money. - Is this so? - Right! I very much like to sleep with her. Yumi, don't just stand there! Make yourself clear! He tells me to play poker with him before we go to bed. Therefore, this money is for prostitution. No cause for arrest. Stop joking! You'll come with us! Yumi, don't worry. Nowadays prostitution is no longer illegal. You were gambling! No use to hide. We know everything. You were playing at your club, right? How much did you make? Who have you played with? Answer! Confess! I did nothing. She's tough and she's only 20 years old. Your mother is currently in jail for murder, right? Like mother, like daughter. Just the same! Mom... is a good person. Stop badmouthing her! Released without charge. It's your first time, so they must have scared you. But you didn't confess. If I did, they'd arrest you too? That's why I held out. That was close. If caught in the act, maximum fine is 50,000 yen. It's not much but the trial costs money. Repeat offenders will be jailed. You saved me again. Don't exaggerate. But how did the police know? I guess some girl at the club snitched. - Who would she be? - Oh... - Let's go. - Where to? Mr. Kada's apartment. He wants to meet you. Offering yourself over poker. You're interesting. But this isn't what hostesses are for. Sleeping with clients... makes your skin wither. It's no easy job. - Stop that poker thing. - But... I want money. Then work harder. 80% of our clients are executives. They have entertainment expense accounts. Be nicer to them, they'll spend more and you'll have a bigger salary. I'm not a sweet talker. I hate to flatter! Be a concubine then. 200,000 yen per month isn't enough. You can take 2 or 3 men. Everybody gets by like that. I won't do such a thing. Then find a rich man and marry him. No one would want to marry me. Why? I'm a murderer's daughter. My mom... She did it for me. She's in jail. So I'm trying to save up, to give her an easy life later. You're a good girl. Then will you accept 1 million... to be the concubine of one man? There's no such man. Have you looked hard enough? Have you flirted around? I'm not such an easy woman. OK. I'll be your man. You... I last kept a geisha 30 years ago. I met thousands of women, but they're all scheming. You're the first one that is frank and honest. I really like you. Stop working at the club and stay here. Today. Today? Here? My wife died 20 years ago. I have no children. I'm free. 1 million every month? I have lots of money. When I die, it'll go to my lousy relatives. Better spend some on you. How about that? I must discuss it with someone. With whom? Mr. Nozawa. Just be his concubine. Why talk me into it? Must be his orders. I owe him one. How? When I became a lawyer, I was young. I traded on stocks. I embezzled Mr. Kada's funds. As a result I was debarred, but he dropped the charges. He took me back. So it's payback time. A debarred lawyer is worthless. Can't start a firm. Too proud to be a salary man. Many became yakuzas' bodyguards, navigating the law's loopholes. Mr. Nozawa. Do you love me? Very much! You'd let me be a concubine? To such a cold man? Such a cruel man? Guess so. But I love you. Marry me. I'll be fired. That's OK. I'll support you. How about your mother? That's impossible! So my mom is your problem? I love Madame more than you. A lie! You're lying! - It's true! - So you're dumping me? Perhaps. So you'd never marry me? - Right! - Even if I beg you? It's useless. Then tell me to die and I'll jump! If you die, what about your mother? So... it's that. I get it. I'll do it. You're wearing this... that's too nice. I quit the club and became a concubine. Concubine? Yes. Can't I? That's pathetic! I know I fell in love with pathetic men, but I've never been concubine to someone I hate. He's in his 60s, but he's so gentle and kind. He owns the club. He pays me a lot every month. Still, he's an old guy! It must be disgusting to be with him. Yuck! But he gets tired easily, so I have it easy. - What a good bargain. - Fool! You have spoiled all my dreams on you! Suit yourself! Tell me. Does it feel good? The female body is so incredible. It's sensitive everywhere. And feels good anyhow. Yumi. Tell me where it feels good, bit by bit. You're a rare bird. Young girls today are so ungrounded. But not you. You don't spend money. You only go strolling. But... you can clean, cook, do the laundry as well. I'm stingy. I was born poor. And also... you're so meek and gentle. I'm like my mother. Nice people destroy themselves. Successful people are selfish and cold. You're so shrewd, but pitiful. You're so incredible. Such a body. Thanks. You make me so high. Yumi. I need a bath. Let me wipe your back. What are you doing these days? Just standing and waiting for sales slips. Pull yourself together, or I'll tell Mr. Kada. Stop nagging. You're sad that Mr. Kada stole Yumi? I feel so sorry for you. She loves money too much. She's not for you. So you hate her that much? It's you who snitched to the police, right? Women will do anything for their men. You and I are over from now on. I do... love her. I guess it's sour grapes? Yes. You're pathetic, treating her like a daughter. She was a good girl. I know now, now that she's gone. - I'm a fool. - Really? I found a patron who's willing to invest 15 million. To start my own place. Bye. Hello. Speaking. Mr. Kada just died in the bath. How? Heart attack? I'm coming. Here's some more. Marvelous. 20,000 shares. It's currently 600 yen per share. The property that is occupied by that club is worth a lot. He gathered so much wealth just for himself. But he's willing to spend on that concubine. He's so cruel to us relatives. All this wealth... could have been snatched by her. Now everything belongs to us. He made all this money for us! Right? - He deserved this! - Right! So you're his lawyer? Is that all? Does he have more? It's all here. Really? I don't believe this. You sat so long, you must be tired. Go take a break. I have something to ask. Come. What? Mr. Kada's wealth will... go to whom? His relatives. That's why they're here. - And me? - You're just a concubine. You get nothing. They won't share a yen with you. If you're... pregnant, then it's different. What if I'm pregnant? It'd be entirely different. The baby will inherit everything. The relatives get nothing. So, Mr. Nozawa... make me pregnant. Tonight. Me? Now's the best time to conceive. But why? Mr. Kada was a fine person. But all the relatives are badmouthing him. I loathe them. So? I want the money. I don't want them to have it. Take me... all night long. Mr. Kada made this money... by exploiting women. You having it, is due compensation. Let's go to a motel. To those relatives you're nothing. They won't expect such a move. It feels great! I'm finally sleeping with you. I'm glad! I'm also glad. I didn't want you... to be his concubine. But why did you? Why? I was going against my feelings. My life has been miserable. It's a wreck. I'm ashamed. - Now? - I mean it. I really want you, no matter what. You've changed. You changed me. Men are changed by women. Thanks to you, I'm becoming a decent man again. Don't go! It's morning now. Hold me some more! No. Let's go back. No! I don't want to. We're staying! I want to eat them up and kill them! Land, buildings, properties. Negotiable securities, mutual funds. Antiques, loans. Cash, movable assets. Taken together, at present prices... 458,786,000 yen. 450 million! How will it be divided? That's the main point. But first of all, what's that concubine doing here? She's irrelevant. Please read this! What is it? From the doctor. Proof of pregnancy. Proof of pregnancy? I got myself checked. I'm pregnant. How about the estate now? The baby is to inherit it all. Even if it isn't born? According to Article 886 of Civil Code, an embryo is treated as a born human. How about our shares? Sorry to say, not even one yen. She'll get the 450 million? Correct. She's the baby's mother. What a joke! She just became his concubine recently! She was just a bar hostess! She'd be having an easy life, how ridiculous this is! But the law is the law. How could that old man make her pregnant? That's impossible! That's so ridiculous! What a joke! But he was in good health. Living with me had revived him. Impossible! Are you really taking it all? But I have to raise the kid, and I have no money. I won't let you have this baby! You bitch! What baby! Take this! Take this! Whore! I'll kill you! Even if you do, you're getting nothing. And for murdering her, you could be... jailed or executed! How about... negotiating with her? Negotiate? You all need money. She doesn't want everything. How much for us? How about one third? - 150 million. - 150 million? - How about that? - I say no to that! Who knows what has she done! It could be someone else's baby. Wait until it's born and we'll check the baby's blood. Even if you go to court, the first trial will take two years. The second and third trials... more than 10 years. Now, it's not just the blood. Its looks and build would be considered. Over 10 years... Also, before the trials are over, you won't get one yen. Not until the day of the sentence. Think well. 200 million. We'll settle it today. No disputes. Is every one happy with it? If not, you must convince her first. It hasn't been easy, but you have settled. You received 250 million. Now nobody's complaining. What if I lose the baby? Don't worry, the settlement... delivers the money not to the baby, but to you. Yes. I'm glad. I want to marry you. It isn't for the money. I love you for real. I'll consider it. I got the money thanks to you. It's the law that helped you. I don't intend to ask you to repay me for landing you at the club. I'm glad to be of help. Wow! So you became a rich woman? The law is so useful! It won't matter when you'll be released. You'll have an easy life. You have money. You're having a baby. You're marrying this handsome and successful man. You have it all. Yumi, you're such a lucky woman. I owe everything to you. Why? You're a good person. You loved your men with all you heart, and worked very hard. You're praising me? Not speaking ill of me? I'm just like you, I should be praised and spoken ill of. Since I was a child, watching you going with men, I remind myself not to be tricked by men. Thank you, Mom. Then get me out of here quick! Your money can do it, right? I'm fed up being here. That's impossible, I'm afraid. You're good at law, right? You'd find a way, right? I don't want to stay here anymore! Yumi! You must understand me! Please do what I told you. What's wrong? You're so pale. I lost the baby. Abortion. - Just now. - Abortion? Yes. Really? I just got out of anaesthesia. It's my baby! The baby. You. We three. I really wanted to have this family! How could you! What are you doing? Why did you do it? Let go! I'm still bleeding. - It hasn't stopped. - It's your fault! You want to kill me? Yes. OK. Kill me! Do it! Do what you like. I did this onto myself! I'm sorry. OK. We'll have another one after getting married. I won't marry you. We're done. Why? You hate me? I loved you so much. But the moment you abandoned me... The moment? When you told me to become his concubine. You persuaded me so hard. The me that has been loving you was dead. The dead won't live again. Impossible! - Yumi! - Doing it again? Beat me? Kill me? I get it. You're my boss now. Please let me stay on as manager. At least let us work together. No. Be it a club or a bar, it makes men and women into deceivers... I hate it. Everybody selling themselves for money. Money is a good thing. It does everything. It builds apartments. I'll live with Mom comfortably. So you must leave me, no matter what? No matter what. - Even if you kill me. - Really? No! Even if I leave you, I'll never forget you. The night we spent at the motel, I was so happy. Very happy. Goodbye. THE END
