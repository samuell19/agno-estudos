I will handle it. No complaint hasn't been filed yet. Not a problem. The inspector has already informed me. Sure, we will do it. There is nothing to be afraid of. Be seated, please. Please tell me, sir. If she comes here, we'll take care of it. Why do you worry? That's not gonna happen. Hey! -Saami! -Sir... -What is it about? -She just walked in. I don't know. What is it? My husband is missing. We looked for him everywhere. He is nowhere to be found. His phone is switched off. How could he leave you? You look hot. What's the matter? Come in. Tell me. What happened? My husband went missing two days ago. I don't know where he went. -Photo? -I have it, sir. -Name? -Ramya. Your husband's name? Karthik. What happened? Why isn't anyone around? What have you done? I am getting a lot of pressure from the head office! I want to know who is responsible for this. Else, I will fire all of you. Don't scold them. He sounds like a bison. Karthik. Read the letter. Let it be a lesson for everyone here. As if it's very important! -Superb! -Wow! You guys are happy because I was fired? What's wrong with him? He isn't wearing his glasses. Read it now. Thank you! See you at lunch. Hey! Why are you still working? Where are you going? You guys win, right? So we're having a celebration. Bye! We should definitely plan a party. Why are you all sad? We're sad! Everyone else is celebrating our success. -We should party too. -Definitely. -We will go to Goa. -Why not next year? We should celebrate right away after receiving the award. We should do it at once. Drinks. -Biryani. -Movie. -Drinks. -Biryani! -Movie. -Drinks. Why don't we drink, eat biryani and then watch a movie? -Yeah, right. -Damn. Great idea! Don't you have sense? Watch where you're going. Did you cover your eyes as well? Oh, God! will cost us. Hey! Pay us 50,000. Where are you from? What are you looking at? Hand over the money. Yeah, ask her... Pay us 50,000. -Will your dad pay for this? -Here comes the hero. -Look there. What is it? It's a one-way street. You should pay the fine. One-way? When did they do this without our permission, dude? We will find someone else. Let's leave before the cops arrive. Wait. Let me see. That's it. Bear with it for a while. Do you work in the same office? Which department? Hello! Your name is Karthik, right? I've seen you before. -Really? Your name? -Ramya. Sorry, I must've been really busy. In fact, my friends start teasing me when I talk to girls at work. That's okay. Anyway, we've met now, didn't we? Okay. We are getting late for work. Shall we leave? Yes. Let's go. No big deal. What happened? -I had a small accident. -Oh, no! Karthik helped me. If Karthik weren't there, it would've been a huge problem. I had an accident last week, but nobody came to my rescue. Why? Because I caused that accident. -Hey! Karthik accepted it. -What did he accept? My friend request on Facebook. I sent him a request three months ago. He didn't accept it. How did he accept yours? Are you jealous? Careful. It might be a fake account. The funny thing is, your request still wasn't accepted. Turn toward your right. Okay. I see you. Kumar... I don't have change. We live in the same area. I'll get it later. -Sure. -Okay. I did not expect this meeting to happen. I didn't expect you to accept my friend request. For what? For accepting your friend request? For receiving the Best Employee Award. Oh! That's nothing. I want to work in the US. -Yes, Mom. -Where are you? I am with a friend. Who is it? Girl or a boy? -Girl. But it's not what you think it is. -I am not thinking anything. Why are you anxious? -I'll call you when I am free. Bye! -Okay. Do you share everything with your mother? My father's no more. Forget it. Tell me about your parents. -Why do you even ask that? -Why? They're ready to get me married and send me away. Everyone's like that. Girls these days achieve a lot. They should be given freedom. Not bad. You're very mature. It's getting late. Shall we leave? Sure. Why? Who is the special one? Yummy cake... Who sent it? My birthday is next week, and we'll go to Goa. I also want a cake. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Ramya! -Hey! Cake! -I have to work. Why is everyone surprised? As if we were outside and gate-crashed upon hearing, "Happy birthday!" It's her birthday... Karthik, wish her. Only then will you get a cake. He sends you the cake and wishes you too! -Go on... -Be quiet. Are these birthday photos? Show me. -No. -Give it to me. What's this? Look at this. I've suspected it all along, but it's confirmed now. Just a selfie, doesn't mean we are in love. Oh! Is he your special one? I get it now. Have fun! Here comes the call from your special one. It's going to be special for you from now on. Shut up! My dear friend! I think about you all the time Don't you know? My companion My eyes are filled with grief Don't you realize? From the corner of my eyes I look at my love With your luscious lips Won't you whisper? Without uttering any word Won't you whisper? Are you gonna kill me Without uttering any word? From the bottom of my heart I become a different person My dear! Without confessing to you I am left in despair When I'm ready to express my love I waver And turn silent My dear friend! I think about you all the time Don't you know? My companion My eyes are filled with grief Don't you realize? You are mine I am your possession To break away from the hurdles I have fallen in love with you The moment you came into my life I started to spread my wings I am flying high now In my dreams, you are my beloved Who are you in real life? I await for your answers Though you've already stolen my heart Time flies As the pain reaches its peak To put an end to my grief Come join me From the corner of my eyes I look at my love With your luscious lips Won't you whisper? Without uttering a word Won't you whisper? Without uttering a word Won't you take away my life? From the bottom of my heart I become a different person My dear, without confessing to you I am left with despair When I'm ready to express my love I waver And turn silent What is it? I wanted to tell you something. What is it? No. Not now. I'll tell you in Goa. Imagine you're in Goa and just tell me. I'll tell you in Goa. Just a minute. Stop. What is it, sir? Let me tell you what happened next in your life. What do you mean? I don't get it. Jenny was at the railway station trying to call Karthik. Sir, the railway station, that's right. But my name is Ramya. Who is... Jenny? I listened to you. Now you listen to me. This number is busy. Jenny was at the railway station trying to call Karthik. Hey! What are you doing here? Let's go. I tried calling Karthik, but I'm unable to reach him. Vanshika is getting water. Okay. You guys get in. Let's go. Hurry. Go fast. Train number 17311... "Jenny. Sharmila." Let's go. ...will depart from platform number two in few minutes. Jenny, why are you standing here? It's time. -Hurry. Get in. -In a minute. This number is currently switched off. Hello, Jenny. This is Karthik. Where did you go? Do you know how many times I've called? Your phone was switched off. What happened? Where are you? Sorry, Jenny. My mom fell ill suddenly. -I did not know what to do. -What happened to your mom? Why? You should have called me. No. I was worried and I lost my phone. I've been at the hospital for two days. I was worried about you. Why do you do this? I missed you a lot. Please don't cry. I was expecting to spend time with you on this trip, but now... I am waiting for it to get over. Okay. How is Mom? I was scared. What if something had happened to Mom? Why do you say that? Nothing is going to happen to her. I just couldn't live without seeing you for a week. All right. What did you bring for me from Goa? I have it. I'll give it to you. Really? What did you bring? Liquor? I'm excited about something, but all you care about is drinks! Keep quiet. You said you bought something. Oh yes! -What are you looking at? Turn around. -Oh! Hey! How was your drink? Keep it with you. Okay. What's so special that you are treating us? Has your visa been approved? I will tell you at the right time. Eat now. Yes. Not now. Inauspicious time. Say it later. Get lost. Have it. I can't eat until I know the reason. I don't have the heart to do so. Your taste buds say otherwise. Eat. Did you notice something? They care about nothing and eat well! Why don't you follow their policy? The samosa tastes good. Really? It must've been delicious when it was prepared. Two samosas... I heard you were giving a treat without anyone's knowledge. What to do? Some people are desperate for treats. Quiet. Your laughter might get us in trouble! Karthik asked me to give you this. Sharmi. Did Karthik tell you the reason for the treat? He said it was a secret. We wanted to give a treat together. But it looks like he did... What? The two of you? Wow! Superb! Hey, guys... We will announce it together. Until then, keep it to yourself. Someone's inside. It looks like you are going beyond limits at the office. That's not true. If you see someone other than me, I'll kill you. Not at all. Why did you get down? I'm expecting Karthik, and we're going out. Where shall we go? -I have a wish. -What? It's your birthday tomorrow. I want to be with you and be the first person to wish you. That's it? I expected something else. I have got an idea. -Is no one at home? -What does it look like? You watch TV. I'll freshen up. Come and hug me tight It's a story of lovers Longing to see each other My sunshine As you embrace me I melt like snow My sunshine Rise like a burning flame My sweetheart When I see the conflict in your eyes My heart melts Rush like a storm The earth doesn't deny The comfort of the pouring rain Would your fingers create magic? As the waves crash down Does the shore stop it? As high as the waves Embrace the shore each day -Karthik, not now. -What happened? After marriage. Now what? You want to get married, right? You and I... In the same house... Let's be... together forever. You mean the world to me When I am with you, I feel secure My feelings often seek comfort The way you caress me It's like a blessing You made my wish come true My heart rejoices As it liberates from the confinement Aren't you serious? Don't you know what's happening? Do you have any idea what's happening there? Come with me. Do you know that Naresh will be taking over the US project instead of you? -What do you mean? -Look over there. Look... Let's not create a scene. We'll deal this at the office tomorrow. You bloody... You gave up my US project for Scotch. -You just had to ask me. -Karthik! I'll kill you. I'll kill you... What's wrong? Why is he behaving like that? Who are you? How long should I honk? What are you doing? Such a dork! Come. Careful. Come. -Hey... -Come. Let go! Who are you? You are high. Drink this. Jenny. Come here. Sit down. I am not blabbering. You know very well. That's what I wanted. I worked so hard for it. Why do you say that? You don't understand. You never will! What are you doing? You are feeling bad because I broke that glass. This is my dream. I don't want this job. We already have commitments and lots of bills to pay. If you quit now, my salary won't cover our expenses. Oh! So you want my money? Are my dreams not important to you? I know all girls are the same. Okay. Come. Let's get in. No need! Let go! Karthik? Sharmi, did Karthik come to the office? No. Why? What happened? Nothing. Let me know if he comes to the office. What happened? Karthik is missing... What do you mean? You are repeating exactly what happened to me! What happened to Karthik? Who is Jenny? Did you find Karthik? Where is he? You have lodged a complaint and we are looking for him. For you, it's just a complaint. But he means the world to me. I can't do anything without my husband. It's like I am going crazy. Please find him. Who is she? Why is she claiming my husband to be hers? What's happening? I got thrashed. I don't get it. So far, I treated this as a missing case, but now it's a case of fraud. Sir. I'll talk to you later. Journalist Jayakanth has got a big case. Hello. He hung up! Tell me. Okay. I sent you a number. Get me all the details. Okay! Who is it? Police. They are here to inquire. What happened? Any problem? Who let you in? Your employee, Karthik has been accused of fraud. He has been missing for about three days. One of your staff members, Ramya has lodged the complaint. This office is at the center of the cheating case. You can't launch a sudden investigation. I am patient, but you keep rambling on! Damn you! Call them! Play that one. What is it, sir? Do you know them? I know. The girl lived in this house. What about him? I have seen him. I saw him when I dropped her at the park. I want to see the CCTV footage. We have checked everywhere. There is no trace of him. No leads so far. He has planned it well. Sir, I have an idea. How about we publish missing person's ad in the papers? Maybe we'll get a lead. Breaking news! The police have formed a unit to investigate the Karthik case. He allegedly married many women. Since there's no information about him... the police have put up flyers in crowded places which has their contact numbers. We haven't got any information yet. The caller is here. Come in. Oh God! I know him, sir. What do you know? We have been friends since childhood. What? From childhood? You look about 50 years old and he is young. I am telling you the truth. He is dead. What does he mean? Believe me. I am not blabbering. He escaped from the mental hospital. We will handle it. Believe me! Come on. -He is dead. -All right, come on now. He is not Karthik. He is Krishnamoorthi. I know him. He is not Karthik. He is my friend Krishnamoorthi. Believe me... Not Karthik, but Krishnamoorthi? Sir, what's going on? I lodged a complaint six months ago. I thought you'd find him, but all I'm seeing are missing ads. They are talking rubbish about him. I feel horrible. He isn't as nice as you thought him to be. He is such a fraud. It's okay if you can't find my husband, but don't badmouth him. A similar missing case has been filed in Hyderabad. Here are the details. Tell me. -Sir, you remember the old man we met? -Who? The one who claimed to have known Karthik. The crazy man. Someone brutally murdered him. This is brutal. How do you think he was killed? We will learn that after the postmortem. Make way... Please get in. Move aside. Please move... Please move out. We couldn't get enough information when we investigated. Move... Not now. Later. I saw. The ghost murdered him! Don't try to scare me. I wonder where they are going. Sir, this is the deceased Venugopal's suitcase. Oh God... Pavan, lights. He looks like Karthik, right? Karthik's photo in Venugopal's suitcase? We made a mistake. We should've continued the investigation when we met him, this wouldn't have happened. What if Krishnamoorthi was Karthik? Sir, he is not Karthik. He is Krishnamoorthi. If Krishnamoorthi is dead, then who is Karthik? What if Krishnamoorthi's ghost is haunting us as Karthik? Shut up! I don't believe in ghosts. The studio's name was on the photo. Let's find out. The people are scared after the murder at the government hospital today. A patient named Venugopal has been brutally murdered. His death remains a mystery. However, the people fear that a ghost might've killed him. Let's get a few details from the hospital warden... The police have allegedly found Karthik's photo in Venugopal's suitcase who's on the run from the law. But the deceased Venugopal claimed he was friends with Krishnamoorthi. So, was it Karthik or Venugopal's friend, Krishnamoorthi in the photo? It was Krishnamoorthi who murdered Venugopal and cheated three girls. Tell us what you think? Just like Benjamin Button, old Krishnamoorthi who's now Karthik might have done this... He is not Karthik. He is Krishnamoorthi. However, the people fear that a ghost might have killed him. It is believed that Krishnamoorthi's ghost, in the form of Karthik might have done this. We have got information about Karthik from Guindy Railway Station. Sir, I saw Karthik, the guy you are looking for. I saw Karthik, the guy you are looking for. He is sitting right next to me. He is getting up. He is coming toward me. I am scared. He should definitely be within a ten-kilometer radius. Alert police stations, checkpoints, everywhere. We have leads about him after a long time. Driver, did any vehicle pass from here? No, I did not see. Yes, sir. A cab left ten minutes ago. Which area did it go? He thought the fare to Anna Nagar was high, so he hired a cab. Get the details of the cab. Sir, it was an Ola cab. The license number is TN09-EC1522. The drop point is Mount Road, booked by Karthik. -Is that the car? -Yes. Oh God! Kneel down. I said, kneel down. Breaking news! Karthik, who allegedly married and cheated women has been caught by the police. Sir, please don't hit me. I don't understand. Why are you hitting me? Karthik! Please don't hit me. Please tell them not to hit my husband. Stop it... I thought you were gonna find him, why are you beating him like this? Please leave. Where have you been, Karthik? How did you manage to live without me? Who are you? Sir, who is she? What happened? I told you she was lying. My husband wouldn't have done anything. Where have you been, Karthik? What's happening here? Ask her who she is. -Who are you? -Karthik? Sir, please don't hit him. Please don't hit him. Kishore. Enough. So... you don't know these girls? -I don't know. -Hmm. Send them out. This proves you're a murderer... and a fraudster. Do you deny these? Sir, I neither know Jenny, Ramya nor Venugopal. But it's true I worked in an office. Please take me to the office. Let me prove it to you. Do you know this place? No. Mr. Karthik. Hello, sir. You said you didn't know. Hi, Jenny. Hello, Karthik. Are you back? Did Ramya and he love each other? -Yes, sir. -Yes. What are you saying? -Karthik? -What? -Even you guys let me down. -Stop talking. Get in the car. Sir, it's clear Karthik has cheated these girls. But there is no proper evidence against him for the murder. No, Saami. We are missing something. Going by the evidence, it looks like you have done it. Do you agree? Sir, this isn't true. I don't know these girls. I was in Mumbai for the last six months. The court won't take your word. It needs evidence. I'll submit the proof. Please give me some time. What is this? Does he claim he was in Mumbai for six months? Didn't you investigate properly? You're wasting our time. I'll give you one week. So as Venugopal said, is there anyone by the name Krishnamoorthi? Sir, I couldn't get any details about that. Please give me some time. Let me inquire. I'll call you back, Kumar. Any other proof? Sir, one minute. How long has he been missing? Since yesterday. Yesterday? What does she mean? Karthik has been in our custody for a week! What if... there is Karthik's lookalike? Priya... Why did you shoot him? He shouldn't be alive. He'll start cheating lots of girls. I lied to you that he was missing since yesterday. It's been a year since we parted ways. Ours was a happy, love marriage. Everything was fine. Till he said he was going to quit his job. That's when the problem started. I tried to convince him, but he didn't listen. We parted ways after that. After we parted ways, I thought he was probably leading a normal life. But... After I learned about his crimes, I realized he cheated me like he cheated others. He shouldn't be alive, that's why I shot him. We beat the hell out of him, but he denied knowing these girls. Even after you shot him... he is missing you, crying for you. Sir, Karthik has escaped from the hospital. -Who was on duty at the hospital? -SI Pavan. Stop! I thought he was in the hospital. What is he doing here? I won't let you escape. You are caught. Where are you trying to escape? Who are you? Do you know Jayakanth, the journalist? It's me! You've cheated those innocent girls and brutally murdered an old man. I'll hand you over to the police. Sir, I did not commit any crime. I'll give you all the details of this case. Please help me. -What? Exclusive details? -Yes. Tell me. Over there! Not a problem. It's a piece of cake for me. Get on! Start the bike. He's here! Hurry up! Sir, I tried... He escaped on a bike. I will trace the license number and find him. Do something. Tell those three girls to be careful. I don't know those three girls and I wonder why they claim I'm their husband. Then what about the one who shot you? Who is she? She is my wife. -Priya. -What? -She was is your wife? -Yes, sir. Goodness! Just a minute. Your life is quite complicated. Okay. I wanted to ask you... -What's your age? -Why is it necessary? I watched a movie. I think it's Benjamin Button... The main lead in the movie was born old, then he becomes young as he grows old. Sir, what do you mean? I am telling this because in the photo there is a guy who looks like you. I thought, just like in the movie... you grew up to be a 60-year-old young guy... and did all this. -Why are you talking like a maniac? -What? Maniac? Excuse me. Please trust me. I need your help. Only if we get hold of the girls, we'll be able to learn the truth. I am getting a call from the office. Police? Are they at my office? Why did you hang up? -The police will trace us. -Even me? Damn it! Now I have become an accused along with you! Those three girls are missing. Madam, Mr. Karthik sent me here. He has nothing to do with this case. Let's not talk about it here. Let's go. Damn! You've made me go into hiding. I saw a girl jumping out of the house. Another girl? I am not coming. You should catch her. -Hurry. -Wait. My hair is all messed up. Come. Please start the bike. Quick! Quick! The bike doesn't understand your urgency. I've got this. Had the police found this, we would have been caught. The footage is safe, guys. Now, all we have to do is, go into hiding. According to the police, it's Karthik who has kidnapped us. Even if Karthik gets caught, he knows nothing about us anyway. They will beat him up, kill him, and close the case. Sir, let's go. I've got all the details about you now. It's with me. I am Jayakanth, a journalist. Let's see who is going to get killed. Give it to me. -Give me the camera. -No. Give it to me. Let go... Sit down. Sit... Can you speak? Sit down... I am talking to you. Sit! Who are you? Why are you doing this? Tell me. Please sit down, ma'am. Where is Karthik? Please wait. He'll be here at any moment. Let me bring him. Madam Saraswathi? Saraswathi... What are you doing here? Where is Karthik? Don't be anxious. Please sit down. Please sit down. Drink it. Drink it up, dear. I just don't understand what's happening. Did you meet Karthik? Where is he? Don't get angry. You misunderstand. He is a good man. There is a reason why these things are happening. What do you mean? I don't get it. Let me explain what happened. Dear fans of Karaikudi Drama Club! Greetings! Every year, during Amman Temple Festival, Senthamizh Kalai troupe hosts a drama. A Renowned artist... A leader and a hero... Kalaimamani Thiru Krishnamoorthi will be performing. We welcome all of you to grace us with your presence. -It's going to start. -Yes. Warriors!

I await your arrival for many months... Lower your voice. How dare you flirt with her! That's just acting. Oh! Acting? If you dare think about someone else apart from me... I'll kill you. What would you do after killing me? You can't live without me even for two days. Would you have sent me a hundred letters? Come. Even when I was on the stage... I was thinking about you. Your lips... My imaginary friend Shall we cuddle For a few moments more? Let's kiss forever Let's put up a fight Looking at you so lovingly My life turned out Like a colorful rainbow Because of you Everything Each day Your presence takes me away With your ardent, innocent eyes For a lifetime I want my hands to intertwine with yours To rest my head on your chest To fulfill myself as I cuddle To live together To merge with you To bear your soul What more can I ask for? This is more than enough! My imaginary friend Shall we cuddle For a few moments more? Let's kiss forever Let's put up a fight On your shoulders I want to ride Cuddle me like a child Times we spent together made me happy Your fragrance leaves me frozen Because of you I lose myself in you My joy multiplies when I see you In my heart My love trudges along For a lifetime I want my hands to intertwine with yours To rest my head on your chest To fulfill myself as I cuddle To live together To merge with you To bear your soul What more can I ask for? It's more than enough! Get up! The show is already over. Leave. Where is Krishnamoorthi? Saraswathi, what are you doing here? You're blushing... Nothing. What's up, Krishnamoorthi? It seems you were hosting a new show in here. What's going on? Leave it. I'll tell you at the right time. Goodness! You are up to something. Have fun! Dad. What are you doing here? What the hell have you done? If anyone finds out, it will be a matter of shame. You tell everyone that you love him. What about our caste and status? He is, after all, a scum who begs to me. How do you even love him? Please do not get angry. I love him a lot. He is a nice man. We love each other. Please don't separate us. Are you out of your mind? Do you even understand what you are doing? Dad... I beg you. You want me to be a part of your shame too? I regret that you're my daughter. As long as I am alive, this will not happen! Let go... No matter how much you beg, this won't happen as long as I am alive. Then, die! Sir... Come over. He fell down. Dad... Madam, how did this happen? We were on the terrace, talking. He tripped over and fell. You can't live like this forever. I understand how painful it is for you. Please don't think you are alone. We are all here for you. I know Krishnamoorthi and you love each other. As soon as he returns, we will plan the wedding. Don't think about anything. I'll plan the wedding. Venu has told me everything. I feel so bad for her. She has lost her family. I know everything. You both are getting engaged in two days. We will begin the preparations. Don't roam around. Stay indoors. Do you understand? Okay. What are we waiting for? Let's prepare for the wedding. -Venu? -Sir. -Smear some kumkum. -Okay. Careful. Not so big, just a small one. Enough. -Is it good? -It looks good. It's time. Please call the bride. Who is she? What do you mean? She is Saraswathi. What? Saraswathi? I've never seen her before. Why? What happened? Why are you saying this? Who are you? Why are you talking like this? Dad, what's happening? She is not the one I loved. What do you mean? Everyone knows both of you are in love. What are you saying? Venu, what is he saying? I have seen both of you together. Yes. Venu is right. They love each other. Her father was a landlord. Call yourself lucky that she loved you. But you humiliate her! You are just a drama artist! How dare you! We'll chop you into pieces! Brother... Please calm down. Madam, we are tolerating this only for you, else... Why do you say that in front of everyone? You told me you liked me and wanted to be with me forever. Why are you treating me like a stranger? Oh, God! What will I do? Where will I go? Madam, please don't cry. We are here for you. Stop acting. We can't let him get away. Tie the knot. Just a minute. If you believe she's telling the truth, ask her to swear upon the Goddess, then I'll marry her. Come on, put your hand on the camphor and take an oath. What are you thinking about? Priest, bring the camphor. Here. Are you still angry with me? Don't think about what happened. It's our first night. Do you like this sari? This is your favorite color. Oh, no! I forgot. They asked me to prostrate myself before my husband. Bless me! You're alone. Who are you talking to? What? Alone? I am talking to you. What's wrong with you? I saw everything. You were talking to yourself like a fool. Yes... I am going crazy. I think about you every moment. I am obviously crazy about you. I love you so much. Stop acting. You made me look bad in front of everyone, and forced me to marry you. Now I'll prove to everyone that you are insane. Please listen to me. I beg you... Damn it! Won't you listen? I killed my dad for you! Then die! I lived every moment thinking about you. Bhanu... The girl you loved... I made everyone believe that it was me. I wrote letters and convinced everyone they were sent by you. I convinced everyone that we were in love. I created situations and chances to get closer to you. Saraswathi, what are you doing here? I decided to destroy Bhanu and her family! But she escaped. I did it because I wanted you. I will do anything to get you. You are so evil. Let me reveal the truth about you to everyone. Come in. Didn't you all speak so highly of her? What happened? Tell us, sir. -Do you know what she has done? -What are you talking about? What's the problem? Tell us. She is insane. Stop yelling. Listen to me. Why are you doing this? Will you never accept me? She is acting. Don't believe her. She has fooled us all. She is crazy. She killed her own father. She is a murderer. You are calling me crazy? A murderer? Why are you accusing me? Stop acting! You hit her, and now you accuse her? -No, listen to me-- -Beat him up! Step back... Step back... Won't you listen to me? She will get what she wants only if I am around. Get him... Don't let him get away. Get him... -Sir, it's Krishnamoorthi. -Come. Stop! You have no other option. You have to live with me. I will decide for myself! Krishnamoorthi... Let go! Why did you do this? Krishnamoorthi... We have searched everywhere. We couldn't find him. I think it's over. Krishnamoorthi... Uncle. Where have you been? Please come in and have food. He's inside. Why? Didn't I tell you I was going to bring it? Here. I made this for you. Please eat. Uncle... Sit down. Let's have food. Come in. Let me wash my hands. My daughter-in-law has gone crazy... mourning for my son. Sir, please don't cry. She will be fine in a few days. Saraswathi! -What-- -Shh! He is sleeping. What are you doing? There is no one there. Have you gone crazy? Krishnamoorthi is dead! I don't mind if you call me crazy, but if you say Krishnamoorthi is dead, you are done for. Let go... Ask them to let me go, Krishnamoorthi. Let go... Let go... Mental Hospital Saraswathi. You can leave. I've got your clothes. Madam. Are you all right? Why are you here? Let's go to our town. No, brother. I'll stay here. I feel peaceful here. Krishnamoorthi... Stop! Krishnamoorthi... Why did you do this? You could have been with me. We would have lived happily. Now... You made me kill you. Krishnamoorthi... I killed him. I killed everyone in the family. I thought everything was over. After years... I saw Krishnamoorthi and your wedding. Krishnamoorthi? Who is Krishnamoorthi? You married him. -He is my Krishnamoorthi. -He is Karthik. Sit down! I said, sit down! He is Karthik to you, but... he is Krishnamoorthi to me. He looked young as ever. But I have gotten old. I have lost my beauty. My face is wrinkled. I feel disgusted to see myself. That's when I learned about Krishnamoorthi. You both were living a happy life. I made sure no one suspected me... I, having lived a queen's life... began working as a maid in your house. That's when I saw his family photo. I thought I killed him once and for all... but he was back and was very happy with you. After seeing all this, I was desperate to kill him. But... at this age... At this age... What can I do? That's when a right... A right opportunity came knocking on my door. You all ruined my life! Who are you all? Where is the old lady? How are you all related to her? Tell me! Else, I'll kill you. Please listen to me. I've got nothing to do with this. These three girls are responsible for everything. Oh, God! Moreover, the old lady, who worked as a maid did all this. Please believe me. Is Karthik telling the truth? He is not at fault. Sir, please come. I have shared my location with you. The proof is in the camera. I told you. Tell me the truth. What happened? As usual, one night, we were heading home after a party. Suddenly, four guys assaulted us. That's when Saraswathi came to our rescue. It's dreadful to even think what would have happened if she weren't there. Besides rescuing us, she took care of us. Why are you living here? Do you need any help? Please tell us. You can't help me with what I want. What is it? You have helped us. Is there anything we can help you with? We are here for you. I want you to kill... I want you to kill someone! Can you do it? I had a daughter of your age. A guy ruined her life after making a false promise to marry her. But he is happy now. Ma'am. Don't be in a hurry. Please be patient. I understand your pain. If we kill him, it will be an easy punishment for him. But we need to inflict... a pain that is... more excruciating... than the pain of death. We will handle that. After that, we started following Karthik. We created a fake profile and numbers... and he had no idea... when we joined his company. We convinced all the staff members that we were in love with Karthik. From whatever Saraswathi told us about... Karthik and Priya's life... we created a story. We had all the evidence to file a false complaint. Opportunities and situation don't arise by themselves. We have to make them happen. I also killed Venugopal. And the assault on those girls? It was all staged by me. Those three girls, they didn't know. So sad. Like he's desperate to save your life, I am desperate to take his life. My instincts tell me... he might've found the girls by now. The phone is ringing. Give it to me. Karthik... I guess you know everything now. If I ever see you, I'll kill you. Really? If you want Priya to be alive, come to my place! What do you mean? Where is Priya? What happened to her? Priya... Priya... Talk to him. Priya... I misunderstood you and things went out of hands. I made a mistake. I am scared. I don't know how long I will be alive. -Priya... -But... I want to meet you before I die. Give it to me. Was it not enough to kill my family? Now you want to kill Priya too? You want to see me, don't you? I'll come. Let her go. Come soon. Or else she'll die. Priya... Come, Krishnamoorthi. There you are. I saw you ages ago. Do you remember this sari? I wore it on our first night. It's the same sari. Have you gone crazy? You are talking rubbish. Where is Priya? Now that I am here, let her go. Instead of calling out my name, you called out her name. Why? I was waiting for you all these days for you were very dear to me. I've lived my life for you. Don't you see me? I begged you when you were leaving me. You never understood my love. I gave up my happiness for you, Krishnamoorthi. But here you are, living happily with someone else! When I saw this... I decided all of you should die. I've gone head over heels for you. But you... You are in love with her. That's why I abducted her. How many more people should I kill for you? If she is so important to you, then you should die. What are you looking at? Die! Or else Priya will die in five minutes. Tell me, where is Priya? Please forgive me. I am an old woman... and I made a mistake unknowingly. I'll tell you... -No... -Step back! Step back! Go back! Krishnamoorthi, die! Or I'll kill you! Why do you talk like a psycho? Krishnamoorthi was my dad. Will you never understand me? Sir, please don't shoot her. Krishnamoorthi... Saraswathi. It's me. Your Krishnamoorthi. I am telling you... Let Priya go. Krishnamoorthi... You are being nice because you want her, right? No. When you rejected me... you sounded more sincere. But now... Now... everybody knows about me. Do you think it's all over? You will never be at peace. Try to save your wife if you can. Wake up! Translated by: Saurabh R Sawant
