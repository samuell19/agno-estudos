- Police Department. - Homicide please. Homicide Division. Lt. Kritzman speaking. I want to report a murder. Yes? Go ahead. Well, I can't. It hasn't happened yet. - It hasn't happened yet? - No... But it will. Soon. Someone is going to be murdered. At exactly... Seven o'clock. - Goodbye Lieutenant. - Who is this? What's your name? Hello... Hello? Haven't you guessed? I'm the murderer! This is a little item I imported from overseas. It's a sensational novelty doll. And just hold this in your hand and when you press the button... You just press it like this, and you'll see that... Woah, he's a little tired I guess. Let's try one of these other ones. Here's one. Just set him up and, all you have to do is push the button. There! See what I tell you. He works. You press the button and he comes back the other way. Anyone can operate him Here's a little boy. You try it. That's it, just push the button, so he goes over there. Isn't that fun, little boy? As long as you keep pressing the button, he'll work back and forth. That's pretty cute. How'd you like to take one home to the youngsters? Hey, what happened? Maybe it's a heart attack. We'd better call an ambulance. That you, Mr. Campbell? We're in here. I didn't realise it was so late. - Our watch is at the jewelers. - I know. Yes, of course. It's just 7:00 though. - Promptness is one of my few virtues. - You haven't met have you. Dave, this is Charles Campbell. - Dr. David Lindsay. - He, pleased to meet you. - Dr. Lindsay? - My office is just down the hall. - You'll remember to give your uncle his ticket? - Sure. He's been looking forward to the game. Sure you won't change your mind and come along? You know I have a class Friday evening. - Is that the big pro game at the Coliseum? - Right. - Should be one of the best games of the year. - So I hear. Dr. Janz gave me the whole line up last night. I guess you know I used to play in college. Funny, I don't really care for football myself. Each one to his own sport. Well, I'll run along now. - Let me walk you to the door. - The perfect receptionist. - Nice to have met you. - My pleasure, Doctor. Charles? Yes? You know I wouldn't take any alcohol before the inquisition. I just want a drink of water. The er... The ice cubes are stuck together. I was looking for the ice pick. So was I. It seems to have disappeared. Things don't just disappear. Here it is. I must need glasses. - Goodnight Dr. Janz. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Good evening, Charles. - Hello, Doctor. Well, Terry, I didn't realise you were still here. - Don't you have a class tonight? - Yes, I do. - Dr. Lindsay. - Yes. He seems to be dropping in often lately. - He left this for you. - Thank you. Now I must rush. See you in the morning. Goodnight Mr. Campbell. Nice seeing you again. Goodnight, Miss Ames. - Sorry to keep you waiting, Charles. - That's all right. Your niece sure is a nice girl. - I've half a notion to ask her for a date. - Charles! Don't worry. I know the rules. No fraternizing between patients and the staff. That's right. Besides I... I doubt if I'm exactly her type anyway. Well, Charles. Go in and make yourself comfortable. I'll be with you in a moment. Well, Charles... Of course, I heard about the job. Myers called you, huh? Couldn't wait to get to a phone could he? I know. But I don't like Myers twisting the facts all the time. I wasn't fired if that's what he told you. I quit! Wouldn't it be easier to talk, if you lie down and relax. Whatever you say, doctor. No, Charles. It isn't what I say. It's what you say that counts. The old technique, isn't it. Pass the ball right back to the patient. I'm sorry. I guess... I guess I am upset about the job. It's a good thing I walked out though. A stockroom clerk in a paper factory isn't exactly a career. Well? Shall we... talk about it? But, but it's just something that happened today. Don't you psychiatrists like to dig into the past? - What happened when I was a kid. Isn't that important? - Everything is. In therapy we do try to explore the past. But we must live in the present. Now, Charles... Tell me what happened with Myers. Let's get the picture, through your own eyes. Myers... Myers, the peasant! You can tell what he is just by looking at him. I know he only gave me that job to please you. - Was is difficult to work with Myers? - No. I hardly ever saw him. It was that girl who made all the trouble. - The girl, what girl? - Edna. Myers' secretary. I tried to stay out of her way, but she kept following me. Touching me. - You're quite sure of this? - Of course I'm sure. Everybody in the place knew what she was. How she kept her job. They talked about Myers and her all over the plant. Sure it wasn't just gossip? I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt. Today, when she made a pass at me... I asked her about Myers. - She told Myers you made a pass at her. - Sure She went to him with a phony story just to get back at me. - You know the rest. - Go on Charles. Go on. - There's no place else to go. - Oh yes there is. You can go back perhaps. - To that time when you... - No! It wasn't like that at all. I tell you she was lying. I didn't do anything. Did you want to do something? Did you Charles? Yes... yes. I wanted to, it's true. Little tramp. I hated her. I could have smashed her stupid face. The girl. Are you sure it was the girl you hated? No no. It was Myers. It wasn?t her. It was Myers. I, I hate him. I could smash him, smash him! I hate him. - I hate him! - Charles, Charles! Thank you. That was... pretty rough wasn't it. I'm sorry. Sorry that you told me? Or sorry that... you feel that way? No, I want to tell you. I know that's the only way you can help me. But... why do I... feel that way? Why? It's the same story Charles. We've talked about it before. You still resent authority. The kind of authority that Myers stands for. By possessing his girl, you defeat him. It would be humiliating authority. I know that, but why do I feel.. that way? You're the only one who can answer that question. We'll just have to keep digging. Tomorrow night then? More digging. Charles. I realise perhaps you think of me as some sort of jailor, but I'm not really. there's only one key that will unlock the key that restricts you and that key is in your own hands. Lt. Kritzman. The coroner's report. Full name, George Seymour Collins, age 54. - Residence 1009 South Beacon Street. - We checked on that. Apartment house. He lived alone. Thin, sharp instrument pierced the heart through the back. Manager said that Collins came from Indiana, three months ago. Quiet man. Came out here to retire. - That he did. Put it on my desk. - Yes, Sir. Come on, let's have a look. I told you before, it was awful. This guy just keeled over dead. It was the first decent crowd I'd had all day. - How's it coming? - We bombed out so far. Nobody saw a thing. He was standing in front of the crowd. Didn't you see anyone move around. Who notices? I was just turning the tip when this guy conked out. You saw the body fall. Who was standing next to him at the time? I don't remember. Could have been some dame. Is she here now? Maybe her! Don't look at me. I had nothing to do with it. Try and remember. Did anyone pass behind the victim before he fell? No... I was talking to Margie here. Telephone call for you Lt. Kritzman. Want it on the extension? I'll take it in my office. - Keep looking. - OK you. Come back here. Maybe Doc calling about the report. - Lt. Kritzman speaking. - Hello Lieutenant. Just thought I'd tell you I kept my word. Who is this? What's your name? Let's not go into that now. The man who called before. I recognise the voice. That's all I have to say. Goodnight. No, wait a minute. Sorry I can't talk now. D'you want to stay up late this evening? - What d'you mean? - Nothing. But I might call again later. Maybe I'll have some more news for you. Sure it was the same one? Did I frighten you? - I was petrified. What did you do that for? I'm sorry. I just want to put my arms around you. Sure did. I thought we had an agreement about that. Well, I can still carry your books for you. Come on, come on. - Low bridge. - Where are we going? Charles, where are we going? Get in... Please. - Give me your keys. - Aren't you going to tell me? But it's a surprise. You'll see. - Come on, let's look at the city. - You said there'd be a surprise. We've been together for a full 30 minutes and I haven't tried to kiss you. Isn't that a surprise? I mean after last night. We said we'd forget about last night. - Let's not forget all of it. - I haven't. I'm sorry about that... That wrestling match. I just lost control. Let's not talk about it. Terry... Are you afraid of me? Why should I be afraid. Because I'm in therapy. I can imagine what Dr. Janz's told you about me. But he hasn't. He never discusses his cases with me. I don't even have access to his notes. Then you don't really know anything about me do you Terry? I might be dangerous. I might have lured you up here to... To, push you off the cliff. I'm not afraid of you, Charles. I wonder if you aren't afraid of yourself. You see those lights down there on the freeway? I was going to school... And my sister came to town for vacation. We went for a drive on that freeway. That truck... I never even knew it was there. When they pulled me out of the wreck, I didn't know what had happened. Until I saw her lying there. Your sister? I... I still can't believe that she's dead, or I killed her. An accident. The police report... said I was responsible and at the trial they wouldn't listen. Didn't you know? They called it manslaughter. That Mr. Langton who brought me to Dr, Janz, he's my parole officer. I understand. Do you? You know what it's like to... lose someone you love? To be shut away like a criminal? Afraid to talk, to even think about it? Dr. Janz can help you. He already has. Just in these two weeks. And so have you. I'm glad, Charles. You've been very sweet. And... I had no right to make a pass at you last night. I am sorry. You should be. I haven't known what time it is all day. Oh, the broken watch crystal. Here. Don't tell me the jeweler repaired it already? Charles, this isn't my watch. Yes it is. I told you I had a surprise. Try it on. D'you like it? It's beautiful. I promise I won't break this one. You don't have to. Hate to kick the city around like this Mr. Sloane. No trouble. The telephone company wants to cooperate too. But it's almost midnight. If you ask me, we're wasting our time. - You want to call it a day? - I guess so. Wait. - Let the switchboard operator stall him - What if he hangs up? Take it, but try to keep him talking. Homicide Division. Lt Kritzman speaking. I sorry, you'll have to speak louder. I can't hear you. Would you mind repeating that. I still can't hear you. No, it's not that. We seem to have a bad connection. No, I just can't... No use, he hung up. - Too bad about the connection. - That was just a gag. I heard what he said. He's going to kill again. He's going to call tomorrow and tell me the exact time. Mrs. Quimby's rooming house. Mrs. Quimby speaking. It's open. - Good morning, Charles, - Good morning. You're wanted on the telephone. Thank you, I'll be right there. Yes, Dr. Janz. Myers called you? Sure, I could see him again. What do you think? Of course I want another chance. I could go out there this afternoon. Thank you, Doctor. No. Nothing else on my mind, at the moment. Nothing at all. Goodbye, Doctor. - Can I have some of that coffee? - Mom made it, help yourself. Hey, you look sharp. Thank you. Going to see your girl? - What girl? - I saw her drive you home last night. Some service. Where were you? Parked down the street in Mac's car. - What's her name? - Never mind. Top secret huh? Her name is Terry. Terry Ames. She's the one who calls from the doctor's office. - Is she a nurse? - Receptionist. Hey, what time is it? I don't know. I still can't find that watch Mac gave me. I haven't seen it. You must have. I wear it every day. Shaped like a heart. I'm always losing things around this place. Too bad. So there it is! My newspaper. - I'm sorry, Mrs. Quimby. I was hunting all over for it. I've got to cut out this murder story for my scrapbook. You and your scrapbook. Would you believe, she's been taking that kind of jazz for 10 years. - Enough to give you the creeps. - Why d'you save it? It's my hobby. I think everyone should have a hobby, don't you? Some hobby, Mrs. Dracula. Mr. Quimby was with the police department. And he always used to like to talk over his work. What was he, a detective? - Not exactly. - He was in charge of the drunk tank, at the city jail. He handled some mighty interesting cases. So after he passed away I started my scrap book. Sort of a sentimental gesture. And you save all the murder clippings? No, only the unsolved ones. Take like today's. There was this fellow got stabbed, in a crowd downtown. You can tell just from reading, the police'll never find out who did it. He just walked up to this fellow, and let him have it. Right through the heart. Please, Ma. Not while I'm eating. That's how the really clever ones operate Mr. Campbell. A quick, clean job and then walk away. You can take it from me the police will never catch up with this fellow. Why, almost all the cases I've cut out... No solutions. I'm sure you're right. - Would you like to finish reading it before I cut it out? - No thank you. Reading about murders... isn't my hobby. Thank you for the coffee. I didn't mean to startle you. Is the doctor busy? No. His next appointment's at 11. - Go right in. - Thank you. You know something? You and I haven't seen one another lately. What's happened? Nothing's happened. I guess I've just been busy. The doctor's patient is due in ten minutes. You better go in now if you want to catch him. Well I'll... see you later. Hey, what is this? Since when did you become a patient? Doctor, there's a... Something I want to tell you. I didn't come in here to see you at all. Just an excuse to see Terry. I see. Problems. Yes, I've noticed. Item # 1, she hasn't been dating you much lately. Item # 2 she doesn't even tell me where she's been or what she's doing. It's all my own fault Dave, I should I shouldn't have let her take that apartment by herself. But you know Terry, independent. Did you notice, she was wearing a brand new wrist watch? - D'you think she's got a boyfriend? - Has she a boyfriend? I don't know. Maybe. - Look am I interrupting something? - Not really, Dave. I'm a little worried about this problem child of mine. - Charles Campbell. - Oh, yes. - Fellow I met last night. Your charity patient - Yes. He interests me. He's interested me for two years. Two years? I thought he was new. No, he's not new. Two years ago I recommended he be committed to a mental institution. But I was overruled. Two weeks ago, they sent him back to me for treatment. I accepted him to find out if I'd been right in my original diagnosis. - Were you? - I'm not sure. I've got to make up my mind pretty soon. Still, give yourself time. Yeah, I wish I could. You know, I have a feeling... Time is running out. That's right Lieutenant, 7 o'clock. The same as last night. Wait. That brings up an interesting question. I'm sorry, I have to go now. It's getting late. Paper? Paper? Well? Been waiting long? About ten minutes. An interesting article here on space ships. How do you figure it doctor? Think we'll ever get to the moon? I wouldn't know. My problem is how to help people stay down to earth. I'm sorry, Doctor. Nothing's coming through. Couldn't we just... forget it for tonight? You don't like to count do you, Charles. Why? - Must there be a reason for everything? - Man is a reasonable animal. - Is he? - Yes. Sometimes we become unreasonable. Like this afternoon, when you walked out on Myers. He called me and told me... He offered you another job and you lost your temper again. It wasn't a job, it was an insult. Night watchman in a warehouse. I wanna do something worthwhile. I wanna be important. We are all important. You know I could have gone into the brokerage business. But your father... My father... Funny. It was my grandfather who was important. He started the business. He was a millionaire before he was thirty. My father just let things slide. If not for him. I wouldn't be here. Yes, that's true Charles. If it weren't for our fathers, none of us would be here. You know what I mean. Here on this couch. - My father never believed in me. - But your sister Ruthy did. She was a little older than you, wasn?t she. Ruthy? Yes, two years. And you thought she was beautiful? She was beautiful. Very beautiful. She was wearing this awful mask for a Halloween costume party. I thought it looked Terrible. You thought a lot of your sister didn't you? Of course I did. In fact, you might say the two of you were very close. We shared each others secrets. - What secrets? - Now you sound like he did. - Who? - Nobody! - Nobody! - Who, Charles? I don't know. Charles. You know these things can be painful at times, but... We can't stop now, can we? No. We can't stop now. Everybody liked him. I can't understand it. My brother didn't have an enemy in the world. Neither did the other victim so far as we know. Ralph and I were going fishing tomorrow, at Malibu. It was his day off. His day off. - Lieutenant! - Excuse me. We'll be right back. Take it easy, Lieutenant, take it easy. - Lieutenant Kritzman speaking. - Hello. Here's the call. You might say we're getting to be telephone pals. - You might. - Number two Lieutenant. Here it is. What's that? I didn't quite get it. Tomorrow night, number three. Now wait a minute. Hello? Couldn't hold him, he hung up. - Think we stalled him long enough? - We'll find out in a minute. Kritzman speaking. Yes... Yes? What was that address again? Hello chaps, good service. You taxi guys get here fast. - How long you been on this phone? - About a minute. - Anyone else here before you? - Yeah, a guy. What'd he look like? - Who looks at guys? - Where'd he go? - I don't care. - What's this all about? Sure you can't identify this man? I didn't see any man. I was in that tavern over there. You're telling me. - Sorry I was so late. The bus service is Terrible. I know, it's just murder. - What? - I said it's just murder. - Where are we going? - You'll see. Another surprise? You're just full of surprises, aren't you? Keep 'em guessing. That's my motto. This is it. - Charles, are you really serious? - Of course, I come here often. It looks deserted. Are you sure we can go in? You trust me, now don't you? Course I do. Then come on. There's the house. How d'you like it? Strange. Oh, no. It's beautiful. I love this place. I could spend hours just roaming around here. Some time I'll take you inside. It's fabulous. Aren't you afraid. What if someone comes? Nobody's come here for 30 years. - How do you know? - I know. All this time. the house has been waiting. Waiting for us. Some day, Terry, we're going to live here. - I don't understand. - You will. Come on. There's even a ball room inside. It's empty and deserted now, but, we'll change all that. How did you find this place? This estate belonged to my grandfather. I'll show you. See? - Campbell. - Spencer Campbell. He was a smart old boy. He made his fortune, and got out. - Wall Street? - Yeah, he was a stock broker. When he quit... He left the business to my father. You never told me about your father. Nothing to tell. He ran the business into the ground. Right into the ground. What is it? That's where they ought to go. All of them. Into the ground. I've got some money coming. Soon. And I've made all my plans. Get a brokerage license. There's nothing to the business really. It sounds wonderful. I was wondering if you're ready? I mean since you're still seeing the doctor. Your uncle? No problem. He told me tonight, I could stop therapy anytime. I still think you should tell him. He has a right to know about your plans. - And about us. - Well of course. I'll know about the money in a day or two. Then we'll go to him together. - Can you wait a day or two? - Yes. I can. The way I feel about you. You thought a lot of your sister didn't you? The two of you were quite close. Quite close... Quite close. The two of you were quite close. What's the matter? Nothing, I'm... I'm tired, I guess. We better get you home. What secrets, Charles? What secrets, Charles? what secrets, Charles? Can't stop now. Can't stop now. Can't... Stop... Now! Can't stop now. Can't stop now. Today is third day of one of the most intensive manhunts in police history. City and County police seek the mystery slayer who stabbed two men to death in downtown streets on Wednesday and Thursday evening. Both killings took place at 7:00. And police report that the man who called the Homicide Office before... - Sounds pretty rough. - But it'll sure sell papers. Making yourself pretty for the patients? My caddy. It's my golf day. Don't forget tonight's the big football game. I'll be there. Oh, Terry... Could remind Charles Campbell today's appointment is 12:00. - I'll do it now. - Thanks. By the way, D'you make up your mind about Campbell? No I haven't. Dave, sit down would you? I must confess, I'm a little too close to this and... Though it's irregular, I'd like to talk about it with you, and get your reaction. If you can donate your services I can donate mine. Campbell's parole officer will be here tomorrow and I must make a recommendation. - He bring Campbell to you? - Yeah. He remembered my opinion at the trial, 2 years ago. So when Campbell was released last month he asked me to donate my services. - Is he disturbed now? - That's just the trouble. He sees Langton regularly and Langton thinks he's fine. No trouble, no drinking. No involvement with women. - Typical All-American Boy. - Maybe. Charles Campbell that I have here on my couch... is quite different. He can't hold a job. Elements of rejection, displacement. Delusions of reference. All of which fits in with what happened before. What did happen before? He was a model student in college. Cooperative, well liked. Usual pattern of adjustment. And then came the explosion. - What kind of explosion? - He had a girlfriend. The daughter of his chemistry professor. He met her one night. In her father's office, after class. Suddenly without warning, he turned on her. Called her a tramp and beat her into unconsciousness. You suspect something like that might happen again? - Don't know. All I really know now, is that... Our Charles Campbell has just spent two years in prison for forcible rape. I'll see you at four then. Tonight? You really are full of surprises aren't you? Yes I do. Bye. Sorry I... - I couldn't help overhearing. - That's alright. Thought you had a class tonight. It was cancelled. I meant to tell you. You find a guy you like? Yes. Dave, I'm sorry. It's alright. These things happen. You... told your uncle yet? No. But I'm going to. I told you so, didn't I? And there's going to be more. Can you imagine him telling the police he was going to do it again? Terrible. Sick... sick... sick. There's one thing certain. Young lady you're not leaving this house tonight. Yes I am. Mac's taking me to the game. You can call him up and tell him you're busy. - Oh Mom, have a heart. - I do. And so do you. And I just don't want someone sticking a knife through it. Let's see. Where's my scrapbook? - What's the use? - Your mother's right, Jane. You too, just because there's some nut running round the place. How do you know that's what he is? Any character goes around stabbing people with knives is nuts. - Definitely. - How do you know? You aren't a psychiatrist. Those head shrinkers are pretty kooky too. They're dedicated men. - Take Dr. Janz for instance. - Dr. Janz. Oh yeah, the phone. Is he a psychiatrist? I'm doing some research with him. I may even write an article on psychology. Remind me to tell you about some of the dreams I have. No! Maybe I better not. - You really do that jazz? - What? You know. Analyze people. No. What's the matter? Are you scared? Or is it that chick? Has she got you fenced in? Terry and I are going to be married. Lots of luck, buster. - I hope you know what you're doing. - I know exactly what I'm doing. The kids, The kids just broke up. And Ruthy, I can still see her standing there. She was laughing so hard, the tears came to her eyes. And you say she was beautiful? Oh yes. Ruthy was very beautiful. What else can you tell me about her? She was always so kind. She was the one who looked after me. I can remember when Ruthy took me to my first school dance. We were always together. - Your mother died when you were born? - Yes. - I never even saw her. - In fact... You might say Ruthy became... Your mother? Yes. Charles... You've read a lot about psychotherapy. You must know that it's perfectly natural for a young boy in certain stages of development to form an attachment for his mother. That couldn't happen to be because my mother is dead. But Ruthy was alive. - That's what he said! - Who? He was the one who belonged on this couch. Always snooping and eavesdropping. He hated Ruthy because she was alive and my mother was dead. Because the two of us always shared our secrets. - He never let us alone. - Your father? Yes. I hated him I could have killed him. Some day. Some day, I'm going to kill him. You can't kill your father. He's already dead. - Dead? - Yes. Don't you remember. A couple of years ago. Just after you went to prison. Oh, yes, I remember. He... He had a stroke, after Ruthy died. Ruthy is alive. - What? - She married. She moved to Evenson Illinois. When she married, she died in your mind. Because the love as a mother died. And to you your father is alive because the hate is still alive. How d'you feel about it now Charles? Charles, don't you think you need help? Of course. And I know you'll be able to straighten me out. Charles, I must be honest with you. I want you to agree to voluntary commitment. - Asylum? - You need intensive therapy. More help that I can give you. With the start we've made... In 6 months or a year... - A year! You wanna lock me up again? For a year? I guess... I guess I knew this was coming. You're right. I do need treatment. I can see that now. Well, let's just leave things this way. You come by tomorrow afternoon. Sit down with Langton. Talk it over. You play golf? Friday afternoons. Dr. Janz speaking. Yes. Of course I read about it. You have? I see. Yes, I can come right down. In your office. Right. There goes my golf game. that was the District Attorney's Office. - The DA? - They sometimes call me in as a special consultant. It seems they have the stabber. The stabber? Yes, you must have seen it in the papers. They think they've got their man. He walked into the police station an hour ago and made a full confession. Somebody confessed? It's not unusual. Certain personality types feel the need for... Punishment. Interesting to see what this killer's like. What else can I tell you? I just made up my mind and I went out. And I did it. I killed 'em both. It's my fault. I admit it. I'm guilty. Guilty. Guilty! Recognise the voice? I'm not sure, could be. Mr. Belmont... According to your testimony you didn't know these two men. - You murdered on impulse. - Yes, I told you. - It just came over me. - What kind of weapon did you use? - Well, it was a... - Was it some sort of a knife? Of course. It was a knife. I long knife. I told you. What d'you think? I'd like to hear him talk on the telephone. Doctor, could this be the man? It's possible, but I doubt it. Now wait a moment. This man admits. Hello. Speaking. Lt. Kritzman, it's for you. Yes, Lt. Kritzman speaking. What? Where? Couldn't he be telling the truth? Yes, I've got it. Hello... Hello? You're right doctor. We're holding the wrong man. - The real killer used an ice pick. - They found the weapon? Not yet, but they will, The killer hid it in a trash can, 600 Block and South Olive. How do you know? He just told me. I love that dress on you. It looks so pretty. - Thank you. - Boy, look at this. I love Sundays. Especially with whipped cream, nuts and cherries. It's great. What's the matter? Are you allergic to calories? - I'm waiting. - What for? Don't tease me. Tell me why you were so late. - I had to make a phone call. - About a new job? I don't need a job, You are now talking to a wealthy stockbroker. Practically. Remember I said I had an inheritance coming? I just spoke to the attorney and he's got great news. Charles, I think that's wonderful. He asked me to come out and talk about it. But he lives way out in Bel Air. - D'you suppose I could borrow your car? - Sure. I'll take a bus downtown. The fianc?e of a stockbroker ride a bus, not on your life. I don't mind. I'll drop you off to finish your shopping. I'll pick you up around 7:00, then we'll go out and celebrate. OK? Wonderful. - Now we can tell my Uncle. - You bet. That's a load of my mind. No more secrets. No more secrets. I can't wait to see the look on his face. So this... is the weapon? We picked it up just where he said we'd find it. I'm positive the blood sample will match Hollingsworth's blood type. One thing I can say about the stabber... - He hasn't lied to me yet. - Of course not. He's too busy lying to himself. - It's a classic pattern. - Pattern of what? Paranoia. In its acute stages the syndrome is characterized by delusions of persecution In reference he hallucinates freely. He can't distinguish between reality and his own imagination? He's sane enough to call and tell us what he's up to. I wish he's stay on the phone long enough for us to trace the call. The paranoid sound sane. That's one of the problems. I asked Dr. Lindsay to come along as he's very familiar with this particular psychosis. A paranoiac may appear to be normal under ordinary circumstances. But there are areas of self betrayal. Inordinate ambition, delusions of grandeur. - In other words a megalomaniac. - Right. We know the type, doctor. The question is, how do we find this man? Every day we bring types in here ought to be put in institutions. What do we do with them? Turn them loose. I know your problem. This man is obviously psychotic. - We can't even have him committed. - You're talking generalities. What about our murderer? We don't know anything. But I think we do, Sir. He always chooses his victim among a crowd. Always uses the same type of weapon. Always kills at 7:00. We know that. I'm not a detective, but this seems a significant clue to me. - The time. - That's right! Why 7:00? Why not 6:00 or 8:00 or midnight? He always notifies the Lieutenant, to make certain that he knows. We do know he intends to kill again. We've got to find him. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. Yeah, it is something like that. For the last time, No! You're staying right here tonight. Ma, don't be such a square. Everybody's going to the game. - It's for charity. - Charity begins at home. And that's where you belong. You should have heard the girls this afternoon. They're scared out of their wits. - Hi, Charlie. - Hi. - Good evening. - I just want to say goodnight. - You're not going out this evening? - Sure he is. - Bet he has a date. - Uh uh. Business. Now you just be careful. Don't worry, Mrs. Quimby. I intend to. Good night. I'm the stabber! I'm the stabber! Bobby, let go of me. I've got to go home. - You're chicken. - Well, it's almost 7:00. You better go to. What if the real stabber's hiding round here? I'm not afraid of that old stabber. - Get your mind on the game. - Sorry I was thinking. Stop it. It's habit forming. - Game's going to begin on the dot. - Yeah, 7:00. That's when East coast TV hook up. Ever have a crazy hunch? - Finally make a bet on the game? - Nothing like that. Something else, I can't get it off my mind. Come on. We are going to be late. - I've got to make a phone call. - Is it so important? I think it is. - I think I should call Langton now. - Can't it wait till after the game? Maybe not. Locate our seats and I'll be right with you. Why Charles, I was just thinking about you. Hey, take it easy fellow, watch it. Stand back please. What's wrong with him? - He's stumbling like crazy. - Ought to get a doctor. Charles! Seems like I've been waiting here for hours. I'm so glad you're here. - Let's go in there. - Charles, did it work out? Everything's fine. I'm free. - You mean you got the inheritance? - I'm free. I can do anything I want. Anything. Tell me about it. I will. In there. Come on. Charles. Just a minute. What's the matter? Nothing it... It's only a couch. It's only a couch. Of course it is. You were going to tell me what happened. I will. Now you're going to be the doctor? Is that it? Yes. Alright. I'll be your patient. Ask me anything. They can't stop me any longer. I'm afraid. Stop you from what? Stop you from what, Charles? Let it ring. - No one knows we're here. - Yes. I left... I left word with the doctor in case... Why did you do that? I always do. In case there might be a message from Dr. Janz. Dr. Janz? Yes. Yes, of course. You'd better answer it. Yes? Who is this? Oh, Dave. My God! Where? Yes. Right away. - What's the matter? - My uncle. He's a bad man. The stabber... I... have to go. I talked to Dr. Lyons just before I came down. - They're still operating. - Operating? He says there's a good chance. D'you think Dr. Janz can identify the stabber? - Were there any witnesses? - D'you think it's the same guy? Dr. Janz is the only one who can answer those questions. I just hope and pray he's able to talk. - Lt. Kritzman, Miss Ames. - We've been waiting for you. Is this Dr. Janz's niece? Downstairs everybody. Downstairs please. There's a nice lobby on the 1st floor. Make all the noise you want there. - I can't give you any information. - The doctor's room? I can't say, I'm sorry. Please go down. - This is Dr. Lyons. - I'm a friend of your uncle's. I looked in at the operation. He's doing very well. - Is he going to be alright? - We hope so. The weapon missed the heart. Just as soon as it's all over, I'll let you know. There's a nurse's resting room down the hall. With coffee. - We'll wait in there. - Thank you. - I'll keep in touch. It's true he was stabbed in the chest, wasn?t it? That's right. Then he must have seen the face of the one who did it. I don't believe I got your name. Campbell, Charles Campbell. You a friend of Dr. Janz's? Yes... I... I'm a friend of Miss Ames. - Is he going to be alright? - He better be. I'm depending on him to talk. You look like you could use a little fresh air. What? It's the shock. I'll be alright. Think I'll grab myself a cigarette whilst there's still time. I was just thinking about you. Thinking... Just thinking... Nothing new happening upstairs. We'll just have to sweat it out. Sorry, your car is blocking the ambulance entrance. You'll have to move it over to the side. It belongs to Dr. Janz's niece. - Miss Ames? She left the keys in the car. I'll pull it away. Hello, Doctor. How is it going? - Alright so far. - I'm so glad. - How about some coffee? - No thanks, the D.A. will be here soon. Miss Ames, you weren't at the football game this evening were you? No. Why? I just wondered. I found this in your car. I can't imagine where it came from. I suppose they throw them in cars all over town. Sure you won't have some coffee? No, I've got to get back. I'll see you folks later. You know I really didn't expect to reach you at the office. I was waiting for Charles. Where is Charles. The last time I saw him was when we were getting out of the elevator. Must have gone home. Terry... You said you were waiting at the office for Charles? Yes. He borrowed my car. He had to see a lawyer at dinner time. When did he bring you back? - 7:00 - Exactly at 7:00? Are you sure? Of course I am. What do you mean? I don't really know. I'm just remembering a discussion I had with your uncle. - Excuse me, doctor. - I'm sorry. Charles... I was just thinking. Doctor, do you belong in here? - Who is that? - I don't know, doctor. Find out his name. - Where did he go? - Who? - Operation over? - Yes. - Get Mac to help me take him to the recovery room. - Who? Mac, remember him. Fellow intern. We will be taking Dr. Janz to the recovery room. Go on! I'm glad you're still here. I found out about the hand bill. We checked with the distributing company. The hand bills were only put out within a 4 block radius of the Coliseum. Four block ra... It seems your car was in the vicinity of the Coliseum. I think we'd better find Charles. He must be at the rooming house. Let me call him. Good evening, doctor. Doctor? Are you ready to move him? Yes. The head nurse didn't call me. Did you ring for an orderly? - No. No, I'll do it. - Who's Charles? - He borrowed her car this evening. It would only take 4 or 5 minutes to get downtown from the Coliseum on the freeway. That's right. The man we're looking for was busy at 7:00 last night and the night before that. You know where this fellow was then? He's a patient of Dr. Janz. He was in the office every night at 7:00 the last, I saw him myself. I talked to the girl at the rooming house. Charles isn't there. I have some good news. Your uncle's going to be alright. He's in the recovery room. Still under the anesthetic but... There's a waiting room up there if you like. - Thank you, Doctor. - Terry... I don't like to keep harping about this. I mean Charles. The other night when he came to the office, you didn't have a watch. He told you it was 7:00 Well, don't you see. He could have lied about the time. - Moving him, doctor? - Yes. Would you tell the head nurse, we're taking Dr. Janz to a private room? Sure. - Thank you. Oh, Doctor. You forgot to tell him your room number. - Would you mind? - No I'll catch him. - Tell him we're taking him to... 707. - Right. Why don't you have the same lunch Sandwiches and things. Silly to go to a great big production. Her apartment's too small for a party anyway. There aren't enough chairs. With that bunch, I hope she doesn't have glasses. You're so right. I'll see you after I get changed. Thank you. You don't like the couch? Do you Charles? But we can't stop now, can we? - No. - We can't find out where they moved Dr. Janz. She says room 707, but there's nobody in that room. - Who told you where he was going? - The doctor who came for him. - What doctor? - I don't know, he wore a surgical mask. - Where'd they go? - They took the elevator. Charles! You know what I have to do? I must. - You don't want to kill me. - But I do. You must understand. I have to. I had it all worked out. I only killed the others so no one would suspect me when I killed you. Did you see the papers. They were looking for a maniac. Not me. Because I was in your office every night at 7:00. But all the time, I was waiting for tonight. Waiting for the football game. Waiting for you at 7:00. You don't want to kill me. - You want to kill somebody else. - No,. No. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? He... he didn't know we were going to the costume party. He was so angry, he started calling Ruthy names. Saying awful things to her. I couldn't stand it. How I hated him. - Oh how I hated him. - That's why you think... You wanna kill me. Because of your mind. I've taken the place of your father. But you are my father. You are my father. YOU ARE MY FATHER! Go away! Go away. Go away! Alright. Get away from him. I don't want to shoot you. Drop the knife. Do as you're told. Yes, father. Come on to bed June, it's late. Oh, Ma. let me listen to the news report on Dr. Janz. You know, when that girl called she was terribly upset. - Let's hope they found Charles. - I'm sure they did. You never have to worry about Charles. It's too bad he's not interested in you. I only wish every girl could meet a nice boy like Charles. Stand by for a special new bulletin. The stabber, the man the police believe to be a homicidal maniac responsible for 2 killings and tonight's 3rd attempt at brutal murder, has been identified. His name is Charles Campbell. Who?
