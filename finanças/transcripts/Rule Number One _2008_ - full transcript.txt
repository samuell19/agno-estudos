Say what? That TV is not even plugged in Really? Saying that man's remote control is able to control both TVs Why do you lie? Why do you want to bluff them?

Haven't seen you for a long time Still OK a little fat a little older, nothing much. Not bad. You maintained yourself very well Always does skin care? It's the lights Do you still dance? Dancing is dangerous especially with you, Officer Huang but you must remember Rule number one "There is no ghost in this world" Mummy Mummy, I want to go home Don't leave me alone I want to go home You're back? Have you eaten? Sorry What happened? Tell you a secret in this house there is not only just the 2 of us here Hey! What are you doing? Why did you pull out your gun? I just wanted to tell you I am having a baby Sorry When did you know? Yesterday Actually, I've cooked a lot of dishes to tell you when you return home Sorry Inspector Liu I want to alter my statement No good at Miscellaneous Affair Department? I joined the police force to be a policeman not.... Not what? That Officer Huang have waited for someone to take over his place for a long time Inspector Liu are you saying something bad about me? Your favorite egg-tart and my resignation letter How have you been? It's the same How's your diabetes and uric acid? All very high This theatre have been built for many years apparently there isn't anyone coming but all our stuff have been kept very well That day...... those bad guys came and mess things up I am so angry Bad guys? I don't even know them As you know, this district is old and not new Frequently, there are people who came and steal things You know? They love to steal posters because they are valuable Not bad, this place is maintained very well But uncle, have you ever thought that nothing last forever Yes you can't just hold on to it and never let go Why not? I want to stay here. I want to keep watch over my stuff I want to keep watch over my home No one can touch my stuff including you You all are a bunch of crooks only knows how to cheat uncle like me You go! You're not welcome here! Go! Uncle..... cool down.... Don't be like this, we.... really have no bad intentions Nonsense. Are you guys really policemen? Yes I made the call. I am the property agent My client bought this old theatre but when the contractors came to renovate it said that they saw some strange "things" Let's make it clear. I am here to help you Who is your colleague talking with? Do you understand? If you chase me away now then there would be no one to help you So, don't have any ideas about this place anymore I said before, I am here to help you I don't believe You and woman gang up together to cheat me That woman is not here to cheat you but to help you I don't believe! I don't believe! I don't believe! I won't let you people to mess my place up Quick, run! Shoot! Shoot! Quick, shoot! Did you hear me!? Shoot! Don't let her touch you! What actually is " Rule Number One"? What do you think? It is a very good excuse Society now talks about logic and science This kind of stuff is exactly the opposite What the "Miscellaneous Affairs Department" needs to do is to hide the truth This is called lying You can treat it like I am saying nonsense Actually, what we saw in the theatre if the facts got out and let people know that there is ghost in this world What do you think would happen? Will there be any kids going to school? Will there be anyone playing the stock market? Property market will collapse You and I will have no need to buy houses That is why I am telling you "Rule Number One' is very important If we don't have "Rule Number One" this world would be chaotic It's very simple if those "things" are to touch you you will be possessed when they got bored they just need to touch someone to possess them but when they leave the body the body will just be an empty casing An empty casing! Your soul will be gone! Tell me, what should we do? We can only take our gun and kill them! This is not my first time but we got no choice if we don't kill them, they will go around possessing.... just like viruses We have to stop them from spreading I know that those that I've killed are innocent but you have to remember when we are caught killing those who are possessed we have to take full responsibility of the consequences There are many types of ghost in this world most of them are sad spirits they are trapped in the dimension of their sadness but some portion of the spirits because of sadness, hatred they will be on another step of their journey Human Possessions until their destination is reached Come Why do you want to quit?
