We've been here for an hour. What's Mr. Long doing? He enjoys taking his time. Brother Yun. Brother Yun. He looks serious. Who's he? Yun Fei, Long's personal bodyguard. Brother Yun, teach us something. He's cunning and ruthless. Mr. Long is scary as it is. Such a thug gives him even more power. Mr. Long. Mr. Long, how are you? Sorry to keep you waiting. It doesn't matter. How are things down south, Mr. Yu? Good, thanks to you, Mr. Long. The weapons you have supplied have been sold as planned to the northern army. That brought us a small fortune. That's good to hear. The war will make us all rich. You're right. We need more weapons this time. How many? Two hundred new Japanese guns. The price? Five thousand silver dollars! Nonsense! Make it 5.500, then. Forget it. Mr. Long, you mean... Go away! Mr. Yu, weapon smuggling is a very risky business. Surveillance has been strenghtened in the province. For less than 20.000, no deal. Fine, we'll settle for that. That's what I call a businessman. We'll carry out the deal in two days. Fine, that's settled then. It's a deal. Take it back. Stupid fool! Yun Fei, you're really merciless. Come, we need to talk. Send word to Lei Hu to get the weapons ready. Also... I hear an Inspector is coming to town. Take a look around and watch out for strangers. What was that? Big Brother! Brother Jian! So many guns! Brother Jian, let's take them away quickly. One is enough. All these guns are worth a fortune. True, but we'd get in trouble with them. Just dump the box into the sea. Quick! Quick! It's like throwing a box of silver dollars away! The one I took will reap as much. Brother, what's in your mind? Lei Hu intended to deliver those clandestine goods to Mr. Long. The news of our hit will spread quickly. We'll soon get an offer for the guns. If we have nothing to exchange, what will happen? It's a big world. We'll just move. Let's separate now. See you in Longshan Town. Not even in the same league, Sharpy. I can learn! Fool! I end up with a wrecked, empty car. They stole everything. And left no trace. The nerve! Big Brother, the robber has good kung fu skills. I think... You "think"! Such an important delivery, and you trust it to fools. You're too careless. This will get us in trouble. How shall we tell Master Long? Master Long... Come back soon. Goodbye. Come on. Hurry. Hurry! - What's with you? 1. I wet my pants. Damn! You're hopeless. Wasting my time. Get out! Hi, darling. Haven't seen you for a long time. I missed you. Making easy money again? No harm in cheating an idiot like that one. Thanks to this, I'll get a fine deal from Lei Hu. Hide it well. You! You're never short of tricks up your sleeve. We're really a good match. A cheating wolf and a cheating bitch! Master Long. Lei Hu, I've always treated you well. Just a few years back, you were a second-rate crook. Without me, you couldn't have come this far in life. Master Long, you... You mean...? I've promised my friends down south to deliver the weapons in two days. Now I'm told they've been stolen barely outside the village. How will that leave my reputation? I'll find those guns for sure. Obviously! You must find them! If we fail on this matter, we'll lose all our credibility. You're right. I wonder who could have pulled this off, people on our side, or Inspectors. Whoever they are, when I find them, I'll break them into pieces. Thinking with your fists? If we get that emotional, we won't be able to kill a fly. Do remember, think clearly before you do anything. - Now go. - Yes. What are you doing? Master Jian, it's been a while! I hope fortunes smiling on you? That's what I came here for. Your turn. Ten. Damn! Earth again! Wang Da-Cheng, you'll lose your pants. Your sister's pants. We both know you won't win today. I bet on Heaven. Call. A pair of two. Shall we call it a day? No! Another round! Fine by me. But... What are you going to bet with? I'll bet one fifth of the land... gifted to me by Mr. Long. So? Listen, I'm not interested in land. What I need is money. Return my wallet. Brother Jian! You're clearly not just anybody. What do you want from my friend? He stole my wallet. I just got careless, and I... Nonsense! Just a moment! - Who are you? - A passer-by. Damn! Return my money! Not enough being Long's dog? - Now you're a robber, too? - Get him! Passer-by, this is my affair. You've nothing to do with it. They leave me no choice. Scram! Hey, friend! If you want to see me, you'll find me at the Brothel. You have good skills. Don't waste them. That man seemed like a good fellow. Sharpy, gather the guys. What's the plan? A big one. A big one. Ye Feng! I told you I'd come. It's been six months, and you arrive without a word. Why didn't you write? I wanted to surprise you. Brother Fan! Xiao Hong, you've grown so strong. And very naughty! Where's your sister? There. Brother Fan! That's it. The latest Japanese model. Two hundred guns, including bullets, it's worth 10.000 . It's from that batch, alright. How much do you want? Twenty percent. You joking? It cost you nothing. Okay, I'll write you a check. Where's the goods? Cash, please. I've been fooled before. I took a check from some crook. Couldn't cash it. Fine. Cash. Where do we meet? Tomorrow morning, by the river. The cash for the goods. Master Lei, can we trust him? We have no choice. Enemies meet on narrow paths! Big Brother, get him. Please. So long. See you tomorrow. Idiot! It's been six months since dad died. It was all because of Mr. Long. That evening, Long and his followers ambushed him outside our home. Instructor Ye, please come out. You are too mean! You should know that those who disobey me must die. Dad used to train Long's men. When he found out about the weapon smuggling, his sense of justice made him refuse to take part. He didn't deserve his fate. Dad! Ye Feng, don't be sad. Your affairs are my own. Your vengeance is my own. I have evidence of Long's crimes. 1 will submit him to the law. But... I fear that you'll be in harm's way. Even if it came to that, it would be worth it. Jian, you often say that if you live to see something beautiful, you wouldn't have lived in vain. Do you find me beautiful? You're very pretty, very charming, but you're not what I mean. Fan Ming? Special Inspector from Shanghai, Fan Ming! How do you know? I was informed of his arrival the day before yesterday. Even disfigured, I'd recognize him. One of my best friends was killed by him last year. That affair, 1 won't forget about. He's incorruptible and shows no fear for threats. He's very skilled in kung fu. Let's prepare him a little surprise. We'll deal with the affair discreetly. Don't worry. I know a lot about him. Please let me handle this. Yun Fei, I count on you. Where's the guns? The cash? Swap now. Open it! Go on! Damn! Big Brother, this money... - Share it evenly. - And you? Me? It's too heavy. I can't carry it. Sharpy, who do you think is the richest man in Longshan Town? Mr. Long! Mr. Long, huh? The fattier, the better. Sharky, go and check him out. Yes, sir! Let's go! GAMBLING HOUSE Xiao Hong, not your lucky day. Who are you? - A friend. - I don't know you. How's your sister? Come on! Sister! What do you want? Nothing... just a small favor. I want you to pass a message to your friend Fan Ming. Well? It's been a while. That's true. What are you doing? Stepping on my toes? You see lots of men. Can't I see lots of women? Nasty! Don't think yourself so great. Someone's waiting for me inside. Who? A handsome man. I'm taking care of him. You? Yes. My name is Fan Ming. I'd like us to be friends. What's up? Can you tell me about someone? - Who? - Mr. Long. Anything wrong with him? Wherever he hides, I'll find him! He's a cunning and devious man. You count on your fists alone to challenge him? Not my fists. - The law. - The law? He's smuggling weapons. And he's been hiring outlaws. To stop these illegal activities, I must first stop Long. Besides, I have some personal business which involves him. You work for the law, and you want a conman for a friend? You're not like Long. I think you're a good man. But you risk your life working for the government. Such waste! Not really. When you live for a purpose, anything's worth it, whatever you do. Life is like a cloud, without shape or purpose. To let yourself go with the wind, is living an empty life. Not really. If I live to see something beautiful, I wouldn't have lived in vain. Whether it's a sublime place, a woman, or even a beautiful thought. But this world knows only ugliness. True beauty does not exist. It does. You just haven't found it yet. Enough of that. What do you say about Long's affair? Agreed. To return your friendship, I'll let you know when I have news about him. Thank you. I'm staying with the Ye's, in Changxing Street. Long is tough to handle. Be careful. Goodbye, my friend. Brother Fan. Xiao Hong. What's the matter? Brother Fan, Mr. Long is carrying a deal soon. - Really? - Yes. It'll take place this afternoon, in Big Stone Hill. How did you learn of this? I heard Long's men talking about it at the Gambling House, by chance. Okay. I'll check it out. I'm not familiar with the place, though. Could you come too? Well... What's up? Fine. I'll take you there. Let's go. Wouldn't it be beautiful, if those clouds of smoke turned into money? To be ready to sacrifice everything for one's ideals... that could be something beautiful. What are you on about? You're always daydreaming. It's as if your mind's somewhere else. Some things are beyond you. What? Reporting! Peeping Tom! What have you found out about Mr. Long? You can speak freely. It's been pretty quiet lately. There'll be a meeting today with someone called Fan Ming. - I don't know what's up. - Fan Ming? - Did you say Fan Ming? - Yes, that's it. They'll meet at Big Stone Hill. Let's go. Where are you going? To see some ladies! You little bastard! Is this the Ye's residence? Who are you looking for? Is Fan Ming here? He has just gone out. What's the matter? Excuse me. Brother, what shall we do? Come! BIG STONE HILL - Is it here? - Yes. Xiao Hong... Sharpy! Jian... Brother Jian. I can't make it. You will. You will. Brother Jian, give me... a cigarette. Let me do it... It's you? Fan Ming is your... He's my fiance. Are you Jian? He told me about you. Long set a trap for him. They beat him up viciously. He fell down the cliff. Long doesn't leave any loose ends. You'd better come with me. Thank you, Mr. Chin. - I'm going. - Come back soon. You may come out now. Little Hung, hide her in your room. I see... You've found your dream. Take good care of her. I'm reserving Little Hung's room. Lei Hu, Still no trace of those weapons. And now this Inspector story. If Yun Fei hadn't intervened, we'd be done for, by now. What on earth are you doing? Master Long, I'm only in charge of transporting the guns. Inspectors aren't my responsibility. And the guns, then? The guns... That guy Jian has them. I'll get them back. Master Long, don't worry. You'll have them. Lei Hu, I need those guns urgently. If you fail me on this matter... you better watch out. Yes... Jian, the beauty of your dreams doesn't eat anything. Stop talking nonsense. You've been out for a while. What's up? Nothing special. I've been contacted by Lei Hu's men. - I'll meet him tomorrow. - You? I won't run away. I understand Fan Ming now. - 1... - This is my own affair. I'll take revenge. I don't need you. Jian, you're in the business too. Why are you doing this? The way you killed Fan Ming was too cruel. Fan Ming? How's that related to you? He was a friend. I don't have a saying in Long's affairs. But you must deliver those guns. Or you'll get in trouble. Lei Hu, you called for this meeting. I thought you wanted something. Idle threats won't get you anywhere. Fine. How much do you want? I know that Long's expecting the guns. I have but one condition. I want Fan Ming's killer. Mr. Long is not that stupid. He'll never agree. If he wants the guns, he will. Fine. I'll tell him. When's the exchange? I'll let you know in two days. I'll take your horse. Slut! You go a bit too far. I understand what you feel. I'll make you happy again. Master Long! Come in! We'll hear from him in two days. But he wants the killer of Fan Ming. Nonsense! Master Long, once we have the guns... Once we have the guns, we can dispose of him. We have to wait two days, though. And Yun Fei is getting restless. Don't worry. We can manage that. There's Little Hung in Longshan Town, who is famous for her charms. Perfect. Tonight, I'll have her come along with some girls. That way... You have nothing better to offer? It takes all kinds. Some people like them. Speak for yourself. Where's Little Hung? Her room has been reserved. By whom? I want her for a evening party. You dare refuse? Why... Isn't that Master Lei? Why are you so angry? Luck has smiled on you. Mr. Long requests your presence. Mr. Long... so what? Men are all the same. Does his ass smell of roses? Does yours? No! Master Jian reserved my company. Honey, he won't be back for two days. That shouldn't hinder you. Go to hell! Fine. Let's see who's the meanest! Don't be angry. I promise I'll be there tonight. Okay... since you promised. That really scared me! If he had rushed in here and saw you... To entertain a customer such as Mr. Long, one must be at her best. You're cl ra: zy! Don't try to stop me. I won't have another chance to kill that monster. Rubbish! Let's wait for Jian to come back. Neither he nor you can stop me. You don't know Jian's heart. I do. He'll do anything for you. I don't need him. I'll do it myself. You... What do you think? Do I look beautiful? Beautiful enough to kill a man! Sister Hung, please grant me this favor. I consider myself already dead. Allow me to close my eyes. Ye Feng, you can't do this. You can't! It's no use. You can't stop me. Cheer up! Mr. Long, have another drink. Drink some more. Hey, come here! What a bore! Yun Fei, try and loosen up a bit tonight. What's up with you? I've seen you before somewhere. Mr. Long, that girl is still... Come! Come! Come. Shit! Let's go. Come and take their clothes off, too see if anyone else is armed. - Don't you dare! - Whore! You all know where we're standing. I won't force you. I'll be thankful to whoever comes with me. And I won't hold it against those who won't. It's up to you. - Brother Jian, we're with you. - Big Brother! Well, I can say that I'm proud of having you as friends. However, you should know... This is not like the other times. Some of you might not return. If we feared death, we wouldn't be following you in the first place. We must inform Chief Inspector Ma so that he can find us. Thus we fulfill a friend's wish. LONG RESIDENCE Where are you going? Fan Ming, this undercover mission to investigate the weapon smuggling has nearly cost your life. It's too dangerous. Sacrifices are necessary. My only regret is having failed to capture Long. Rest assured, we'll get him sooner or later. Where are you going? I must see the Chief Inspector. Let him come. I bring a message from Jian... Jian? What happened? He's going to attack Long with some brothers. - Where's Long? - In his mansion, near the old road. Chief, please send our men. - Right. Wang Gui! - Sir! - Chang Hao! - Sir! Assemble the men! Fan Ming. You haven't recovered yet. It's my duty to go instead. What's up? We have a score to settle. Never mind me. Go on, quickly! - Over there. - Go. Leave him. THIS IS A FREE FANSUB. NOT FOR SALE OR RENT.
