The ghosts have started banging on the door I'm so scared Let's take Krishna out Only if he comes out you can possess him, right? Krishna won't come out Listen, ghosts Let's make a mutually beneficial deal As a lawyer let me suggest this With my thriving practice as a lawyer let me proudly share something with you A minuuuute correction in your contract Only if you agree to this... ...will we send Krishna out Stop, don't bring the roof down!

Why are you in a tearing hurry? Go ahead and sign Catch my pen Both of you sign 'Do it now' That was a good deal! Hi Sara Why are you following me? Please leave me alone Sara, try to understand Don't you recognize me? Oh God!

A girl who is ditto you If you compare, you'll be spooked at the mirror reflection! My brother was madly, deeply in love with her But she passed away! - In an accident - Really...? You believe me, right? But he doesn't! He still thinks she's alive and is following you We don't know what to do We'll make sure hereafter he doesn't disturb you Turn, she'll call us I was wrong, huh? Excuse me 1 minute - Did you call us? - If you don't mind May I know what happened? When we feel like sharing... ...we get choked and our heart gets heavier Give us just 1 day We'll tell you We should've planned this better, right? Shall we take this scene? What is his name? Krishna...not that name! - Krish...Krish - Krish? That girl... ...will she resemble me? That's where the problem arose Show it to her She looks exactly like me Look, even you got confused Our brother is so innocent, poor chap! What kind of person is Krish? Very calm and composed Stylish too! He has a heart of gold But quick to lose his temper His fists speak! His words are few and far But his hands compensate! [adapted from 'Arjun Reddy'] - Where did he see that girl? - Who knows! Where did he see? Where is love likely to blossom? [adapted from 'Ghajini'] [adapted from 'Arjun Reddy'] "A girl, oho I saw her you know" "With a vermilion halo she was a golden statue" "Oh she was so fair and sweet she made my heart skip a beat" "I am no Lord Rama, firm and faithful Neither is she Sita devoted and dutiful" "This is an unrequited love story doleful" "Your dad will be my father-in-law, dear If you won't love me, I'm single I fear" "You come near me, 'pongal' festival If you ignore me, woeful upheaval" "I'll call your dad 'uncle' fondly I'm single for life if you don't love me" "You come near me, 'pongal' festival If you ignore me, woeful upheaval" "Hey girl, besotted by me, it's true Don't make me get smitten too" "Thanks to you, my hiccupping heart pleads Don't make me lose my head please" "Girl, you're besotted by me, it's true Don't make me fall head over heels too" "'Cos of you my hiccupping heart pleads Don't make me a whacko please" "Hey! Dingiri baby!" 'No need, akka' - Krishna - Make them out of focus, dear My specs! Interesting beginning? There pops up a minor litigation What happened? [adapted from 'Arjun Reddy'] Aw! Krish Don't hit me You said Krish was calm Is he quick with his fists? So...he is...not...him You'll get it- You said he's hot tempered but he's getting thrashed? Er...that is- Sara, go 'Isha, come' Son of a gun! She got it mixed up! Aiyo! "A fort as tribute for my love I built Royally she ignores me to the hilt" "She trapped me in a web so cleverly Sliced my heart with love's knife severely" "Girl, come to me of your own accord Come in search of me, to strike a chord" "Without you in my life I'm a royal mess Don't kill me slowly, my princess" "Hey girl, besotted by me, it's true Don't make me get smitten too" "Thanks to you, my hiccupping heart pleads Don't make me lose my head please" "Girl, you're besotted by me, it's true Don't make me fall head over heels too" "'Cos of you my hiccupping heart pleads Don't make me a whacko please" Did he profess his love? When he was about to he faced a severe blow Aiyaiyo! How sad [adapted from 'Kushi'] You saw What did I see? I saw you when you were looking I'm telling you I didn't see - I saw you looking - What is there for me to see? Don't argue Leave now Leave my daughter alone or I'll kill you Krish...Krish - Don't, Krish - I will kill your family Tell your father - Krish - Hey...! - I'll show you my true colors - Krish, please What a misunderstanding! Forget that You understanding? Under- Akka, watch that scene [adapted from 'Thuppakki'] He got angry and joined the army "Hey girl, besotted by me! I'm smitten by you totally" - He became a cop - 'When?' Akka, this scene is good - Shall we use it? - Okay Ultimate hero Ajith, akka [adapted from 'Mankatha'] "Hey girl, besotted by me! I'm smitten by you totally" Was Krish in the military? Didn't you say he studied medicine? Now a police officer? Don't ask logical questions Look into the magic "My style, my speech all unique, darling Fuss and ruckus you make is endearing" "Let me follow you to make you my wife Don't say no and give me strife" "Your cheeks are rosy My precious missy" "Speak words of love my treasure trove" "If you and I become 'we' people's favorite we will be" "Hey girl, besotted by me, it's true Don't make me get smitten too" "Thanks to you, my hiccupping heart pleads Don't make me lose my head please" "Girl, you're besotted by me, it's true Don't make me fall head over heels too" "'Cos of you my hiccupping heart pleads Don't make me a whacko please" [adapted from 'Alaipayuthey'] That's life! Our brother is such a pitiable soul Unlucky fellow! We'll make sure he doesn't disturb you hereafter 'You do your bit of what we copied' She is a carbon copy! You wanted to ask her for some help Good girl, she'll definitely comply We are caught in some kind of mess You don't want me to find out about it What is it? And why? I don't know But let me request you just this Whatever the problem Don't abandon me What, dear? What are you preoccupied about? - Nothing, dad - What happened? I met a lady today, pa I was really disturbed listening to her brother's love story 'The girl he loved died it seems' 'She looks ditto like me' Mentally he's not well His sisters want me to profess my love to him to cure him If that will cure a person of his ailment you shouldn't even think twice How can I profess my love to a random stranger? I understand Even if you fall in love with a person you've befriended for a long time Sometimes you will tend to hesitate Still if someone will benefit it isn't wrong at all - What are you saying? - Yes, Sara I think you should help them 'Okay, boys Get ready' Give it to him This is your last day If you go now you won't come back Yes, your love is a success So is our Operation Exit-Spirit We will meet after 30-40 years Hand shake 'What's this new car coming up our driveway?' Here I am! Hey! Krishna Who is this, dear? His friend, akka Ages since I saw you! - We are doomed! - How are you, sis? You are even more fair after coming here Who is this?
