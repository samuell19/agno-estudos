The Curse of Belphegor - So, do you like it? - Not bad. Oh, "!not bad"! Wait till it?s finished and put on the stage with the lights: - this will be the high point of the show. - A very expensive high point, young man. You?d like to have everything for nothing. I wonder if this is not going to be a little too tall after all. - What do you think? - Wonderful. - But did you read the paper? - No, why? Do you know this reporter? Claude Randal? - No, not at all? - May I? - Because there?s an article... - Is there? So, what is this article saying? Reporters have nothing to say anymore... "Should we see in the death of the decorator a manifestation of Belphegor?s evil power?" "Our readers will learn about the mysterious divinity in one of our coming articles. " The bastard! Two days before the opening night. - Where are you going? - To tell him what?s on my mind. He?s a lively young man. - Excuse me, Sir. - What? Oh... Miss? - Is the director of the theatre in? - Yes, Miss: in his office. - No! Don?t walk under the ladder. - Why? Are you superstitious? - No. - Yes he is. - Oh, here you are, you. - Being superstitous is not nice. - Oh, you little punk. - What do you require, Miss? - Good morning, Sir, I?d like to see the director. - Whenever you want. Thank you very much. My name is Claude Randal, - I?m a reporter for " Le Proven?al ". - Oh, you?re the one who... - Did you like my article? - Oh, enormously. - But the director... - Could I meet him? Calm yourself: if anybody can tip you about Belphegor, I can. What about having a drink together? We could have a little chat, miss. Gladly. May I ask you to wait just a second for me? I?ll be back in no time. Careful! You no-good kid, I?ll kick your arse, just wait and see. Ain?t you going to stop screaming at the kid in front of the young lady? - Miss... - But he?s always after me, always... - He wouldn?t hurt a fly. - Yes, he?s nice. - He?s my wife?s pet. - Very nice. Excuse me, gentlemen, I need a word with my guardian. - I bed your pardon. - Could you give me a loan? - Oh, you call them loans? - I?ve got expenses. And with reporters, you must buy drinks, you must... - Oh yeah? I thought you were going to punch his face? - I can?t. He?s too old. - I?ve just got this. - That will be perfect, thank you. And don?t worry about the man: I?ll deal with him. - Can you hear? - Well? It?s always the same music. And the music... comes from that? You may go, Sir. It really comes from this. It really does. He was right. Come on, Gentleman. Belphegor is going to your head. A cardboard statue playing music? Are you out of your minds? You?re right. Some idiot is trying to scare us, that?s all. No, Mr Garnier. Do you know me? You?d better show yourself. Won?t you answer? Answer, dammit! Who spoke? It was I, Belphegor. The master of you all. If you go on with the show, you?ll all die just like your decorator died. You, Garnier, will be the first. You, Jacques Olivier, for having tampered with my legend. Then, it will be your turn, Fred Daxo, for accepting to direct the show. You, Hubert Delaroche, you?ll be second to the last victim, who will be your star. Very funny. You?re not going to believe in this grim joke, are you? Remember: you?re all going to die. - Did you turn out the light? - No, it was a general failure. Why would I turn out the light. - Don?t worry, it was just Belphegor... - Oh, I see, Belphegor is... You Belphegor you. Oh, boy... - Hello? The Electricity Company? - Yes, sir. - Did you just have a general failure? - Not at all. Thanks. - Why do you laugh? - I think this is a very funny hoax. - What if it were true? - We?ll see, since you?re to be first. Why, you! Oh, excuse me, but you?re to blame, you never miss one. You don?t either. I think the Belphegor legend gets on our nerves. - You?d better call the Police. - Yes. Give me the Police. I should throw you all in jail. I guess the Gentlemen want to advertise at the taxpayer?s expense. - Do you maintain your statements? - Well... Oh, come on, you heard just like we did, didn?t you? - Yes. - It talked? - Played some music? - Yes. It didn?t also dance the Charleston, by any chance? Or the Cha Cha Cha? You don?t need a theatre but an asylum. Good evening, Gentlemen. Yes, of course. - Shall we talk a bit about Belphegor? - Is that so urgent? Yes, because we'll dance all night. You?re going to try and kiss me, I won?t let you, you?ll be very angry and I?ll be left knowing nothing about Belphegor. - You doubt me? - Yes. - So, did I lie? - No. And what happens during that scene? Well, you see, the victim is lying here, on the altar, and at some point... That?s all. And now, you?re going to keep your promise. Would you please put the weapon away? Wait just a second for me. I?ll be back. And afterwards, I?ll treat you to dinner in a very, very funny little place. You?ll see: I?m sure you?ll like it. And... How can one trust women after that? - Did you arrange everything? - Of course I did. - Don?t you think he?ll try? - Don?t worry. Everything is all right. - What about the music? - It?s ready. Bravo. If you do everything I say, soon we?ll have enough money. Your leg, higher! Look! Come on, pay some attention, will you! Look! Stop! Nadia, come here! Can?t you be more sensual? Be female! You know what that means, you use your charms enough in real life. I?m fed-up with your stupid jealousy. I?m free, free, do you hear? - My private life doesn?t concern you. - It does when you act like a bitch! Oh, no, please, no domestic rows during work hours. We?re rehearsing. - You?ll pay for that, Fred. - Of course I will, of course. - Take your places, take your places. - Music! - Hubert! I?m going shopping. - You do that, Kitten. Have fun. - Bye. - Bye.. - So this is the number? - Jean! Send in the altar! And now a last effort. Come on, arch your back. Arch it! One, two, three, four, that?s it! One, two... Come on, Nadia, put some strength in it, for God?s sake. - One, two... Now that?s better. - Hi, how are you? Come on, Nadia, arch your back. Keep your shoulders back. Come on, arch your backs, girls! Yes, that?s better... Keep your shoulders back. Together, dammit! What does this mean? - Are you kidding me? - What can I do about it? I?m not paying you to be ridiculed in the newspapers, am I? And I don?t want to be a scapegoat. Be assured that no one would ever take that seriously. - Oh, really. - What? Look, I?m doing what I can, you?re never satisfied. - Oh, you have some nerve. - Oh, you, that?s enough, enough. OK, it?s all right, let?s call it a day. If you think it?s possible to do something worthwhile in such an atmosphere. - Hey, girls! - I?m fed-up with working for loonies. - So am I. - Don?t get angry, Fred. Fred what? Couldn?t you avoid talking on the stage? Hey, hey, hey, children. Won?t you pick up your clothes? Good heavens, don?t leave them lying around, I can?t take it anymore. Who do you think I am? Your maid? - Hey, Plumme! - Yeah? Oh, you, little punk, you?ll see, you... Oh, oh, I?m getting old, I can?t take a joke anymore. Oh, boy. Hello there. At least you?re not burderned with scruples, are you? - Your guardian is not happy? - Put yourself in his shoes. - He?s furious and I look like a fool. - He will forgive me eventually. - Oh, you know, he and reporters... - Why? Can you think of one theatre director who wouldn?t be upset by an article like that? - Oh, that?s it? - It is. Be a doll and help me meet him. He might be less stern with me. Knowing him, it?s better to wait for the storm to subside. Anyway you?ll come to the premiere tonight and I?ll see you after the show. - Good evening, Claude. - Let?s go. Belphegor! Belphegor! Belphegor! - No, impossible. - Oh, I see. Another conquest. No, she?s a little reporter to whom I?m giving a few tips... as a friend. Oh, as a friend, of course. - Oh, darling, you were divine. - Fine. - You?re as good as your word. - I promised I?d come. Maybe I shouldn?t have. - The young lady is quite charming. - Yes, she?s very pretty. - Congratulations, that was an excellent show. - Thank you. - The boy is quite charming. - Why? Do you like him? - You know I?m married. - It doesn?t show much. Ah! Am I allowed to kiss my actress? What a success. Please, miss Nadia, a picture for my newspaper? Of course. But be quick about it, we?re in a hurry. - I didn?t see you today. - I?ll explain. We rehearsed all day. - You could have phoned. - Sure. In front of your husband? Well, I think I owe you a return match for the other day. - So do I. - Tonight, I?ll allow you to take me out. - We won?t talk about Belphegor,will we? - I promise. Good. Wait a second. Jean! Tell my guardian I left with an old reporter who wants to interview me. - OK. - Let?s go. Well, are you coming? If we want a good table, we have to hurry. That?s it. Get lost, children. Come on, come on. Hey, careful, you. I still have my rounds to make. Good evening. - Will you be long? - Well, a good half-hour. - Accounting, my dear chap. - I?ll leave you then. The evening wore me out. - Good evening. - Good evening. - Good evening, Mr Hubert. - Good evening. Come in. - Excuse me, boss, will you stay long? - Yes, a while. - I?ll go on making my rounds then. - That?s it. Good night, boss. My great love... Good night, angel. And good night, ghosts! And this is the end of another good day! Come and drink your herbal tea. Then we?ll go to bed. Yeah. I?ve got to wait till the boss goes away. - What? Has he gone already? - How should I know. - Come on: hurry up. - Yeah. Is there anybody here? Hey! Plumme is getting old. Plumme! Plumme! Plumme! Plumme! Help! Help! Plumme! - Plumme! Plumme! - What? - The iron curtain is down. - Is she crazy? I?m coming! - Quick! - All right! What?s the big hurry? OK, let?s put some lights on, shall we. What do you know! What little fool took the fuses out? Here?s for the curtain! And now some lights! - While you?re here, open the altar for me. - Fine. - So my beautiful beastie. - Hey, are you nuts? Some of your screws must be loose. Hey! Look! Look! Oh! The boss. Belphegor... - Have you heard that music before? - No, no. Doesn?t it remind you of any previous show in this theatre? None. And, really, you know... Tell me, Mr Plumme, didn?t the victim?s ward try to kill you with such a dagger? The dancers we questioned are positive that he did. Well the dancers pulled your leg, nothing more. Does the kid have fun scaring a pal? Sure he does. But killing me? Good morning, gentlemen. I?m sorry I kept you waiting, but tonight is our opening night and since I?m now unfortunately in charge of the management... Yes, yes, fine. We?d like to talk to you. Alone. Of course. Just one second, please. Jean! Oh, here you are. You?ll check the winch. And don?t waste any time,please, we?re running late! After you, Detective. Well, you know, those cops begin to be pains in the arse. I hope the kid didn?t do anything wrong? Are you crazy? Don?t say things like that. What if the Detective overheard? Come on, come on, come on, split! Sorry... - You often needed money. - Were you never twenty-five? You?ll inherit the theatre. That will be good for your business, won?t it? Oh, you know, the theatre... - my guardian wasn?t exactly the boss anymore. - What? No. Following a show with Daxo and Olivier, a disaster, they didn?t fulfil their obligations, and Hubert forced my guardian to sell him most of the shares. Oh, does Hubert want the theatre! But, in spite of that, your guardian went on working with Daxo and Olivier? He still hoped he could get his money back. It was an obsession. Where were you tonight, between 1 and 5 a. m.? - Claude! Hi, Sherlock Holmes! - Good morning. - So, how is it going? - Fine. - Did you find your Belphegor, by the way? - Maybe. - Oh, did you? And you?re really sure, are you? - I think so. - Lef?vre, here. Is that you, Raymond? - Yes. Roger Rodin invites his collaborators tonight, to celebrate their opening night. - They?ll meet at the Grotto. - Detective! - Mister Morgeot on the other line. - Tell him to wait. It?s a small restaurant on the docks. They?ll be there at midnight. I?ll have dinner at home and fetch you at your small diner at 10 pm. OK? OK, but don?t make me wait. Get it? - OK, ciao. - Ciao. He?s still with the others. It was a tremendous success. To the kid?s success. Well, to Roger?s success, then! Thank you, Plumme. Another one? Gladly. It?s quite easy on the throat. And it?s good for your health. While you?re at it, you?ll finish the bottle, won?t you? Oh, really, it?s just to oblige you. Don?t make your lady wait too long, Plumme. Oh, no. Oh, no. Bye, lads. Go home safely. Don?t be naughty. - Success makes you sad, my dear Olivier. - No, I?m just a little tired. - Let?s go and have a last drink. - Sorry not to come along. What about you? We?ll go and see the girls. Well? - Yes, OK, it will be a distraction. - Well, at the Fuego, in Sanary. - Done. - Great. Good night. Goodbye, darling. - You?re not going home with me? - I?ve got a date. - With whom? - A business date. I?ll meet you later. Fine. As you wish. You?re free. Hey! How good is your salad! Nice place here! - I?m having a real good time. - Come on, Plumme, easy on it. - Mr Plumme? - That?s me. Mr Plumme. At the theatre, they told me I could find you here. - Oh, I know who you are. - Is Roger with you? No, he just left for El Fuego, in Sanary. - El Fuego in Sanary? Thanks. - You?re welcome. - Good night. - Good night. - Your husband just left with Roger. - Shall I meet you at your place? No, I?ll be home quite late. - Where are you going? - You know that, don?t you? - The bugger lost us. - Yeah. Well, you see, your little Calvados gave me strength. They made me drink Champagne, and I don?t like it. Too fizzy. - Goodbye, pal. - Bye, Plumme. Oh, my regards, madam. Oh, Champagne... - Plumme is really plastered. - That?s the truth. Thank you. Excuse me, Plumme. Yeah... my great love... my little love... ouch! Belphegor... Murder! Belphegor killed me! Help! Arrest him! Murder! Belphegor killed me! Murder! Help! Help! Help me! Belphegor killed me. Arrest him. Arrest Belphegor! Belphegor! Arrest him! It?s him! Nine... no... five, six, seven... R...? What?s the matter with you? What a business! Belphegor! He killed me. Look. Yeah? I think alcohol killed you. Oh, come on, what did we drink tonight? - Just one small pick-me-up. - Yeah, just one small pick-me-up. - What?s going on here? - Well, here it is: Belphegor killed me and went away in a car. - Did you see the license number? - Well... 926... something like that. - Tomorrow, come and testify at the station. - OK, officer. - See you tomorrow, Mr Plumme. - Thank you, thank you. Oh, it?s a good thing that I?m still fit, because Belphegor... All right, come to bed! Come on! I didn?t know that you were Sherlock Holmes. Congratulations for finding us here. I took a cab to the restaurant, then Plumme told me where you were. It must have cost you a fortune. That is irrelevant when you love your job. Oh, so you love your job? I thought you loved me. You take a lot for granted. - Are you OK? - Yes. Well, you know, I rather like Belphegor now. Yes, it might surprise you, but I don?t fear Belphegor anymore. Belphegor? Bah! And, you know, I?m second on the list. - Second on the list? - I think our friend drank too much. Second, yes. But I don?t care if those two bastards, Fred and Hubert, croak too. They organized that swindle in order to ruin your guardian. - What are you saying? - Yes, they wanted the theatre for themselves. That?s true. The music... Belphegor?s music... Oh, look! It?s Belphegor! Help! Help! Let me get out. Let me out! Claude! Wait! - Mrs Oliver? - Yes. Who?s asking? Roger Rodin here. Sorry to bother you in the middle of the night. Is your husband back home? No. He told me on the phone that he was with you. Didn?t you see him? Of course I did... Well, I don?t know, I don?t understand, he... Won?t you explain? Well, we were together and suddenly he left me for no reason. That?s why I call you in order to know if he came back. I can only tell him to call you as soon as he arrives. Yes, of course. - Is that you, Detective? - Yes. Oliver?s car. - Oliver? What Oliver?s car? - The author of Belphegor. Explain yourself, for God?s sake. It just stopped in front of the police station. - Did you question the driver? - There wasn?t one. - What? - The car came by itself, Detective. - Are you kidding me? - Oh, Detective... All right! Call Lef?vre and tell him to fetch me. I?m coming. Police! Open up! Police! - Hey, wake up. - Not on my head! - The Gendarmes. The Police. - Oh... Yes, yes, here we are. Oh, boy. Here I am. Here I am. The Police! Do you realize? You never should have got involved in that. - And, pray, what about my duty? - All right. And please, do not meddle in this. It?s men business. Yes, yes! Keep calm. Yes, yes, here we are. What did I do to the Good Lord? - You took your time. - I couldn?t open butt naked. - Well, Plumme... - What? - They say you?ve been assaulted tonight? - Assaulted? I?ve been killed! Struck down for good. Bam! Here, look! Will you look at this? Ouch, ouch, can you see? - This is really serious. - Do you think so? No. Come with us under the stage. It wasn?t under the stage. It happened in the great hall. What I want to see is your altar of Belphegor. Oh... That is... Do you? Well... please go ahead. - This way? - Yes, yes. On your left then on your right. What?s going to happen to us next? Mind the steps. They?re treacherous. This way. Follow me. And look where you walk... Because there are always lots of things... This is it. Here is your... Oh! What in God?s...? The author! I?m going to take a little pick-me-up... Excuse-me. No, no, no, count me out. After Garnier, Olivier. That?s enough for me, I don?t want to be killed. My dear friend, you forget our agreement. If you opt out, you lose everything. It may suit you but it doesn?t suit me. Dough, always dough, I?m fed up with it. Look, I admit that you?ve got a hold on me, but from now on, do what you will, you can count me out. That?s your privilege. And I now know what I?ve got to do. Oh, it?s you. - Are you surprised? - Well, a little. You know, I waited for you all night long. Why didn?t you come? Because my meeting was longer than I thought. So I came home. - And did you listen to the radio this morning? - No. - Are you going away? - Yeah. - Well? - Well... Do you want me to tell you something? You are Belphegor! You?ve got too much of an imagination. That?s bad. Very bad, you know. - Mr Daxo, please. - On the third floor, the second door. Come on, you. Publicity will get you to the cemetary, kid. - Why not? - Two corpses are enough for me. - I don?t want to get killed. - Mr Daxo, please follow us. Yes, I saw Belphegor. He does exist, he?s shrouded in mystery... much more so than we thought. That mystery... I shall unravel it for you, dear readers. Do I have the honor of speaking to Claude Randal, the famous reporter? - Yes, it is I. - Oh, good morning, miss, Roger Rodin here. - Does that ring a bell? - Oh, it?s you. Where have you been? You?ve got a nerve. First you steal my car then you ask me where I?ve been. Be a doll and lend it to me for today. Oh, simply, just like that, for today... And to go where? To look for Belphegor. Enough! You carried Olivier?s corpse on the statue of Belphegor. Denying it is useless. Come on: confess! I didn?t do it. I never killed. Plumme recognized your wheels. He got the number wrong but when he saw it, he was positive. And you ran away on the double after you clobbered Plumme! Why did you come to the theatre? Talk! We?re not going to stay here for three days. I came to fetch confidential documents. And those papers... do you have them? I already told you I destroyed them. Bad luck, isn?t it? Let me tell you one thing: your story will have the jury dying with laughter. I swear I?m telling the truth. I?d been exploited by Garnier for years. So you killed him. Why didn?t you say so at once? - I swear I?m innocent. - You lie! You are the murderer. I came to fetch some papers that Garnier made me sign. Unprovisioned checks, if you?ve got to know everything. But killing, like Belphegor?... - You lie. - I repeat that I?m innocent. I checked every file. Olivier was right: you?re something of a scoundrel. Because here, here and here, I discovered your trick. you can?t do business with sentiment, my dear chap. You?re too young to understand that. I think you?re very calm, Mr Delaroche, - for a man who knows he?s been condemned to die. - Don?t touch me. I forbid you to touch me. Don?t touch me. Roger, Roger! Hey, Belphegor confessed, he did! - I was sure it was him. - Roger: Him? Who? It was just on the radio. It was Daxo. Have the two of you got a problem? Goodbye. Well, here we are on location for the reconstruction. If your client is now willing to help us and show us how he managed to bring the corpse of his victim - on the altar, we?re all ears. - I didn?t kill him. I am innocent. I lied because I couldn?t take it anymore. Yes. My client only confessed because he was questioned for more than 8 hours. Since he is innocent, he now retracts his confession. And I was afraid. Yes, afraid. I didn?t want to be killed like the others, if you can imagine that. I thought that, in prison, I would at least be safe. And you?re hoping to go away scot free just like that? My client is innocent. Let Justice prove him guilty if it can. - That?s why we?re here. Mr Plumme? - Judge? - Where were you assaulted? - In the entrance hall, Judge. - Take us there, my friend. - OK. As you can see, I?m really easy going, my dear Counsellor. Since your client confessed once, you?ll have to admit that... Your friend, the reporter, wrote a fine article. - Did you read it? - No. You should tell her not to play Detectives too much. It?s a profession. Here we are, Judge. This is the place. This way. Well, then... you see. It was here. Exactly here. I had just done my last patrol, I was about to turn in, and lo! He hits me with a truncheon and I drop dead. - He?s a hard hitter, Mr Belphegor is! - Yes, yes, I clobbered him, OK. It doesn?t mean that I killed the others. I swear I?m innocent. I?m not a murderer. - Can you hear? - What? The music of the statue. Yes, this is it. Can you hear it? I?m sure it?s the music... the music of Belphegor. Belphegor! Belphegor! Belphegor! There! He?s dead. Goodbye, Mr Hubert. - Oh, Tonin, did you see Mr Marc? - He went down this way. Oh, thank you. - Mr Marc! - Yes! Hey! I?m in my boat. - Can you come? - Coming! Yeah... - Are you inquiring about your alarm clock? - Yes I am. It?s in my workshop. I?ll fetch it for you. I installed a new alarm: a small marvel. Very good. - Do you like it? - Gee... - Is it Mr Hubert?s Belphegor? - Yes. Thank God he?s not for real! He?s got a nasty face. Shhh. He?s a God. You should never talk ill of Gods. They can hear everything. Oh, say, you?ll end up frightening me with your stories. Miss Claude Randal, please. I haven?t seen her since yesterday night, Sir. She went on a trip. What? She didn?t come back yesterday? No, sir. Can I give her a message when she comes back? No, no, thank you. - Plumme! - Yes. - Didn?t the lady reporter leave a message? No. You?re beginning to fear for your wheels, aren?t you? I don?t give a damn about the wheels. She's disappeared, Plumme. She disappeared. Well... And what if she phones? Plumme! Plumme! Plumme! - Who?s calling me? - I, Belphegor. Stop joking, guys. Go outside. Roger?s car just arrived, it?s in front of the door. What? What are you babbling about? Oh, you... - You shouldn?t laugh. Go and see. - Er... er... Thank you, Mr Belphegor. - Plumme! Little Plumme! - What is it? Listen to this. Belphegor talked to me. Oh, I swear if you go on drinking like this, something bad will happen to you. He talked to me, I tell you. To me. Yes, and, to me, he sang the great aria in Rigoletto. - Oh, will you look at that man! - And he even brought back Roger?s car. Oh, come on, I?m not crazy, am I? Something to pick me up. Damn... Tell me: a car that would run without a driver, all on its own. Is it possible? Hey, you?ve got a loose screw this morning. Don?t you feel well? Plumme! Mrs. Plumme, where is Plumme? - Oh... - I understand: there again. Oh, here?s the comedian. Refresh my drink. Quickly. - Plumme? - Viscount? - Come on, we?re closing. - What? - Closing. - Closing what? - The theatre. But, come on, all the seats are reserved for the whole month. - You?re not going to refund, are you? - I know but... Titin! Two "pastis"! Mr Hubert is not feeling well. Yes, that?s an idea. I understand. It?s your turn, so you may be a little afraid. But do not fear: Plumme is watching over you. And Belphegor... But I?m not afraid, my dear Plumme. - You don?t know me well enough. - Don?t I? - I served in Naval Artillery. - You didn?t... - I did. - What, you were a "Bigor"? - Yes! - No! - Yes! I was a "Marsouin" (marine) - You weren?t? - I was. - You don?t say! - Oh, boy. Another one! And that?s not all. There?s something else. If we close the theatre, we must refund... Yes, that?s what I always say. If we close, we must refund. - Titin: two more! - Two more. - But when were you a "Bigor"? - In ?45. Oh, then I was in... And don?t worry, Hubert: we?re all behind you. Plumme, Hurry up, lunch is ready. I must go, cause if I don?t, pal... I?ll go with you. Don?t worry: I?m just not afraid of women. Hey, I?m thinking, why wouldn?t you have a bite with us like an old pal? Well... Kitten is waiting for me in Cassis. Oh... he?s waiting for you in... - Why don?t you come with us? - Oh, I really can?t, you know... My little Plumme... What would she think of me? - Well? Hurry up, hurry up! - Goodbye. - Good bye, Plumme-Plummes! - Goodbye. Go and sit. Lunch is ready. You know, I?d never have believed it, - but Hubert, by God, he?s got some. - Some what? Courage. - Oh? - Yeah. Hurry up, I?m hungry. You don?t really believe that the car came back to the theatre on its own, do you? - No. No, Mr Belphegor brought it back. - Oh, don?t bother me with Belphegor. How stubborn can you be? He told me so himself. - Oh, so Belphegor talked to you too? - Yes, he?s talking to me. So what? Well, if Belphegor talked to you, I?m Napoleon and he?s Richelieu. The problem is: I believe neither in miracles nor in ghosts. Three corpses. A vanished Claude Randal. What more do you need? I can?t take all your "son et lumi?re" stories seriously. Right, let?s wait for a few more corpses, and maybe Mr Detective will believe us. Look, I?m doing my job, so you?d better make it easier for me instead of telling me tall tales. No one here has a tremendous passion for cops, especially these days, - but we?re ready to help you, Detective. - I swear! During that crazy race, I could follow Belphegor?s car. He left behind a trail of green light. The car he drove entered a farm, then a barn. I went in after him. Not a trace, either of the car or of Belphegor. I went back to my car. Curiously, the flagstones in the path were green too. Where is Belphegor hiding? Who?s Belphegor? My next article might tell you that. Green stones... Green stones... The quarry in Le Pradet... The copper quarry in Le Pradet! Oh, God, I?ve got it! - Your idea might be good, but... - I don?t know if it?s good. But the girl has disappeared. You?re not going inside this house, are you? I don?t want us to have any problem. Don?t pay any attention to what he says, lad. He?s an old geezer. Go on. Excuse me, officer. Officer! I?ll be damned! What are you, Raymond? Looney? Will you stop walking up and down? You?ll give me vertigo. Graduate of the Salzburg Academy. Your tricks will have us demoted, that?s for sure. - We?ll get our pension. - Sure, but I don?t want to end up in the can. That would be rich. Good heavens! Here it is, I was sure of it, we?re done for: the owner is coming. - See: you?re not in the can yet. - Just wait. Say, Raymond, shouldn?t we beat it? Hey, if there were only guys like you in the field, we could start doing needlepoint. I don?t know. I looked everywhere and all seems normal. I don?t understand. Let?s go back to the office. Come on, Al Capone. No, no, it?s not your turn. I wanted to inform you of your friends? visit. - The Police are looking for you. - Why do you kill? Belphegor doesn?t kill, he punishes. He especially punishes those who dare to tamper with his legend. The music diploma! - Will you take a message for him, please? - Yes, - but from whom? - Roger Rodin. Tell Detective Legris to have the house we left yesterday night watched. - It?s urgent. - Fine. I?ll tell him as soon as he gets back. - Good morning, Detective. - Good morning, Sir. - Good morning. - Detective Lef?vre. - Yes, we already met at the theatre. - Oh, yes, yes, I think so. You?ll be under his protection. You may fully trust him. How nice of you to send us a guardian angel. What with Kitten and Mr Jean, I?ll feel safe. I?m going to prepare you a meal, using my culinary secrets, you?re going to love it. - Of course, you?ll stay, Detective? - Unfortunately, no. I have to go. - What a shame. Another time then. - Gladly. - Kitten! - Yes. Will you help our new friend to settle down? Certainly. Come, Mr Jean, I?ll show you your room. - Er... the problem is... - Yes? - We have arrangements to make. - Oh? See you later then. Say... you?re not going to leave me with these... er... It?s the service, old pal. In our line of work, you must expect anything. Oh, come on, Raymond, you can?t do this to me. - Do what? - Well, the... ah... Keep calm, Jean. A big guy like you. Think about it: what have you got to fear? OK, ciao! - Are you really sure? - I?ll give your regards to your wife. No... wait... Your move. Checkmate, Detective. Detective! Please, hurry up or we?ll be late. Come on! - Oh, Kitten! - Yes? Do you know what you?re going to do? - You?ll take the meal and take it to the fishers? cabin. - Got it. - Good. Come on, Mr Jean, come on. - Here I am, here I am. You know, we?re going to do some jogging. In the morning, just after sleep, it?s wonderful. It just builds your appetite. Come on, let?s run. - Hurry up! Come on, faster. - I don?t believe it. This guy must have Greek ancestors. - What with Marathon and... - Hey! Yes, just one moment, I?m coming. Come on, Mr Jean. Come on, show some courage, breathe deep. What on Earth is he doing? Oh, go to hell! Yoohoo, courage! Yoohoo! We?re almost there. Here is the cabin. No... no... No! No, leave me alone. Help! Help! Help! Help me! Yoohoo. Yoohoo. Here is lunch. Isn?t Hubert here? - Hello? Detective Legris? - Yes. This is Belphegor. You won?t have much more to wait: I just called the Press. I?ll execute Nadia Stratford tonight, during the show. - No need to call, Inspector... - Jean. Come quick. Yes, my skill in communication techniques is limitless. You can?t trace my call: you don?t have the means. - You?re stark raving mad. - No, Detective. I just need my fifth victim. After that, you won?t hear about me again. At least as far as the theatre is concerned. Hello? Hello? Hello? This is something else. - Did you call me, Raymond? - Do you know who just called? - No. - Belphegor. - What? - Yes. Hasn?t he got a nerve? Oh, by the way, still no news from Roger? - The Plumme don?t understand. - Did you take the relevant measures? - Yeah, I sent two men to watch the farm. - Come along. This time, either Belphegor or we must go down. Come on, come on, let us through, come on. Say, do you think he?s going to kill her? Don?t worry. I?m keeping my eyes on Belphegor. Ah! My Plumme is still strong, isn?t he? - Good evening. - Good evening, miss. - Madam. - Sir. Here is the program! A program? Agreeing to help us is very brave of you but don?t forget that, in spite of our protection, there are big risks involved. You can still refuse. Miss Nadia, on the stage in a few minutes. - Can you hear? - In a few minutes. - This call gives you my answer. - Will you be up to it? - I?ll try. - Thank you. I?ll leave Lef?vre with you. Don?t leave her side before she goes on stage. We?re not going to cool our heels here all night, are we? - What about raiding the house? - Legris said to watch it, nothing more. We?ve got men around the altar. - But don?t you move. - All right, boss. - Who knows? Roger might come your way. - Yes, I got it. All the exits are watched. Do you think Belphegor will kill her? You?ll die at the exact moment when I?ll execute Nadia. Her success will have been very short-lived. Tonight, I?ll strike her down myself. That will be my triumph. You?ll be caught. You?ll be punished. When I put this machine on, it will slowly advance toward you, - and nothing will be able to save you. - You?re a madman. A sick man, yes, you?re a monster. Show some patience. It won?t be long in firing up. Don?t worry: you won?t suffer long. - Instead of reading, you should be watching. - Yes, chief. - Everything?s OK? - Yes, yes, yes, chief. Don?t complain, you?ve got a front row seat while, - here, we?re getting bored for nothing. Ciao. - Ciao. Come with me! - Hey, anybody there? Police! - This way! - Police! Anybody in? - This way! This way! Quick! We?re tied up. He fainted. Here they are. Go and call the boss. - May I look? - Yes, of course. Your gizmo is funny. - Stay here. - OK, boss. Belphegor! Help! Quiet! Quiet, please! There was a small technical incident. Nothing serious. Please, do not move. Quiet! Do not move, do not move... Raymond! He went this way, come! It?s Belphegor! Stop him! Stop, detective. That's Plumme! What?s up, Plumme? - It?s Belphegor. He went thatta way. - Get in, quick. Yes, I?m coming with you. He?s probably going to Roger?s farm. Step on it. We must catch up with him. - Hello? Detective Legris? - Yes, speaking. This is Roger Rodin. I?m in Soub?rol?s car, with him. We?re following Belphegor. He?s going to seek refuge in the quarry in Le Pradet. Did you hear me? The quarry in Le Pradet. Are you sure of that? Yes, he?s in a Renault van, an R4, just in front of us. Go on following him. We?ll join you in a few minutes. Don?t let him out of your sight. Over. - Are they coming? - Yes, they?re following us. Pass them, for God?s sake! Step on it! Come on, come on, damn it! Come on, come on. Oh, boy! Talk about an avalanche! I think that, this time, we won?t hear about Belphegor anymore. - Well, you never know. - OK, let?s go. They can?t touch my legend. I?ll be back! Belphegor. Translation: Goupil66 Jan/Feb/Mar 2012
