None ofthis was necessary You're as big as a bull! Why are you scolding me, that too in front of our kids? To get me scolded Get lost! But still, to hate Brazil itself, Do we need such a person? Isn't there an ethical issue in that? On second thoughts, my opinion is that we should let herjoin And with them, there are four girls, including Devi who goes to Kalamandalam - Is that even a fair reason? - Isn't it? If she passes that, we'll let herjoin When she chased him away, Ajayghosh became the refugee, right? Vipinan, our Master would decide whether to let her pass or fail in the interview! Mehru, right? A democratic interview is going to happen here The President of Brazil fans, Ajayghosh? He's a bourgeois rascal! The policies against imperialism by Argentine... So our President Kirchner is a tigress! -What do we tell Vipinan nouf? -I don't know Don't turn Argentina Fans Club into a place to take out your personal grudges Didn't you just ask that? When she said some tongue twisting foreign name, With that, our Master's tongue got stuck in his throat We should have brought someone from outside for the interview! Are the Brazil fans rascals barking too much this time? She's so shy! Vam os! Get lost! Don't talk such vulgar stuff! I mean, this is my first bride-seeing ceremony, that's why... You must be waiting for someone with good height like me, right? lfthe horoscopes match, Karthika's wedding should be at Koodal Manikyam She got 4-5 marriage proposals before this To protect our tradition, faith and rituals, Dad, Brazil fans have a woofer That's bigger than this AC?

Since Argentina had to squeeze in somehow, our excitement levels were low Absolute genius Even ifArgentina gets a draw against Nigeria today, Or will they rise from the ashes? That question booms around! This is like Emperor Shahjahan playing the Veena, Can't you stop yourself from correcting me at least once? If we lose tomorrow's game, I thought that she would tell me that she loves me, at least during the last moment Or, maybe because she doesn't want to hurt my mother l have lost, man! finally, inthe reality show called life, Do you know what makes me sadderthan her wedding? I made it up on my own What did I say? After the game? Should I look for brides?
