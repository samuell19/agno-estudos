Max, I came here to talk to you alone. You were supposed to deliver a package to my boss two days ago. He's done waiting. You've got 24 hours. And if you don't deliver in 24 hours, you know what's gonna happen. Man, that guy really needs to get laid, huh? It only gets better from here on in. And your loyalty will be rewarded. You know we never let you down, right? But we have been taking a lot of risk lately. A lot of unnecessary risks. And I'm not complaining. I'm just saying that... What they're trying to say is... That we're locked and loaded and ready for whatever. Guys, it's Friday, let's have a drink. I want you to go out and I want you to burn some steam off because I want you to be ready for the main event. We all need it. You still haven't told us the plan for this week boss. What plan? Oh yeah, the plan. I'll lay it out in time. Now is not the time for work. Business is great. Life is good. You know what they say, All work and no play makes Jack an asshole. That's why I insist you guys go out and enjoy yourselves. I'm all for that boss. I just wanna be ready when the time comes to have your back and the sooner I know what I need to know, the better I can do my job. Did I say something wrong? No, not at all. I just had a moment of clarity. You see, you're the most recent addition to my security team so I had a background check on you and guess what? You came out clean. Spy clean. And then yesterday, a colleague of mine told me that she knew you by Kniffen dang Imagine my surprise when I saw a picture of you together in Turkey. I still didn't believe it, until now. Salam Aleikum my friend. Aleikum Salam. Who the hell was that guy? Oh him? A spy. Enemy brought us over here to make sure this transaction won't happen. Then they know you've been feeding me intel. Yeah, it means I'm suspected. If I was made, I would be dead. Still, what's gonna happen when this guy doesn't show up? I'm not worried. I shot him with the weapon you gave me. They track it back to us troops. Exactly. That means they're gonna know you've been feeding me intel. Look, I can take care of myself. I feel like you're not understanding me. You're burned. We gotta get you out of here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not possible my friend. Not possible, okay? I cannot leave. Why? That's why. She's beautiful. Who is she? She's my wife. We met in secret so that way my enemies won't know my weakness. Today I found that she was pregnant. Congratulations. Thank you. Now you see why I can't leave and why the money you pay me very much, I need. I almost forgot. I didn't. So what do you got for me? Yes, yes. Business, business, business. Three groups of 30 coming down to US compound post tonight. Very heavy firepower but they travel light. So no tanks or anything like that. We need to fortify defenses. Not necessarily. Let's just say bring 200 troops to the South by midnight. You should kill them easily. Much obliged. Oh, and thanks for saving my life again. No problem. You'd do the same for me, no? Yeah. I hope so. Yes. Good. Because I've hearing rumors that I've not been liking too much. What kind of rumors? Your President is meeting with the Turkish President tonight. Probably some political bullshit. No. Significance, friend, significance. The Kurds I've been working with the US forces for years. Thousands have died already. Now, I'm not worried about myself too much. I know my faith, Allah. I know I've been here. I know where I'm going to but if that happens you please tell me if you hear anything of any withdrawal. Please, urgency. Tell me. Not to worry about me but Aisha. I think your worrying about nothing but of course I got you. You look like you've been in the desert for a week. Did you get anything good? About 90 Skinnies headed toward base camp tonight. I love it. Why is that funny? We've got a surprise waiting for them. We're gonna barbecue those sons of bitches Why? we got a new weapon or something? Dude, he's been in desert. He hasn't seen the news or anything. Will somebody please cut the shit and tell me what's going on. We got orders from the Commander in Chief to vacate this hell hole. We're redeploying today. Base are already empty Sheph. Well, you know, except for the C4 we left behind. We're leaving? Get the Arabic out of your brain and listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth. You go home now. In International news, Following the US President's decision to withdraw all troops from the region, abandoning it's Kurdish allies, Turkish forces have moved in slaughtering thousands of Kurdish fighters and civilians. David, It's me. I woke up and you were gone. Anyway, last night was fun. Call me. David, it's dad obviously. You didn't show up for your job interview at the firm. I don't know what you're trying to do, but I can't keep putting my reputation on the line for you. Call me. Shepherd, it's Dr. Schwab from the VA. You missed your appointment this morning so I was just calling to make sure you're okay. You may not think your therapy's working but I assure you we're making progress. Please be sure to reschedule it. Alina? Yes. Drive fast. Okay. Rough day? You don't even know. They say bartenders and drivers are the best listeners. You look like you have enough problems of your own. No offense. Everybody has problems. Everybody sleeps in their car? Smells like morning breath and sex. What? I have parents. I know. I thought we were talking about you. Trust me. You don't wanna know. Try me. I just saw something horrible. What the hell? Who are you? I'm nobody, I swear. Nobody wants to kill nobody that bad. Wait, what are you doing? Get down. What's your passcode. I need to call my parents. I don't recommend it, not yet. Why? If someone's after you, your parents could get caught in the crossfire, and you don't want that. So then what are we supposed to do now? Let's start with trying to figure out who's trying to kill you. I don't know. You have to know. What were you trying to tell me in the car? You saw something horrible. My best friend Natalia and I, we go to St. Mary's School and she left her book at my house so I went to return it. The front door was open so I walked inside. When I got to the kitchen I saw a man stab Natalia's father and I ran away but I think he saw me. What does Natalie's father do for a living? I don't know, but they're rich. Expensive cars, nice house. All of that. Hey, why aren't you more freaked out about all this? It didn't happen to me. It did. There's bullet holes in your car. Do you want me to freak out? No, but I don't want you to accept it like a psychopath either. You ask a lot of questions. So do you. I was in the army, okay? That's cool. What'd you do? Intelligence. You, intelligence? I expect an intelligence guy to be all nerdy and reading data all day. I did that too. Those are analysts. I did that too but mostly human Intel and interrogations. That's cool. Why'd you leave? Long story. Tell me. Some other time. Let's focus on keeping you alive. Okay, so now what? You must have a plan. Bad guys always have a plan. I'm working on one. Working on one? Maybe we need an analyst. Very funny. Get in the car. In the front seat. This is your home? Well, technically. It's my dad's house. You still live with your dad? He's old. He gets lonely. Make yourself at home I'll be right back. David Shepherd? Who the hell is asking? Howard Baskis. Z sends her regards. Who the hell is Z? Hello. Oh hi, you must be David's dad. I am and who are you, young lady? Alina. Well, hello Alina. Where is my son? I don't know. He went to go get the mail but I think he went to get food or something. He told me to make myself a home. Oh, he did, did he? Well, let me call him. This is David, leave a message. Well, seems like it's just you and I. Have you eaten? No, I'm starving. Well, join me in the kitchen. So you like sandwiches? Yes. So what did my son tell you about me? Not much. Just that you're old and lonely. Really? But it seems like you have it more together than he does. Well, my son is going through a rough patch right now and he's keeping it together. Definitely from his time in the military and obviously he's got a big heart. I mean, you're here. So tell me, how how did y'all meet? He picked me up. Picked you up? Yeah, Rideshare. Rideshare, yes. Good, so go on. Calub, you seem like a really nice guy and I don't really wanna cause problems but there's more to how I met David. You see, when David picked me up, I saw something horrible. I saw my best friend's dad get stabbed. I'm so sorry. I know it must be really hard on you. I'm going through it. Well listen, you're in the right place. Like I said, my son's got a big heart and he knows what he's doing. You can depend on him. So we wait for him. And for now we'll have some sandwiches and... Video games. And play some video games, of course. Welcome. Oh, don't be so antisocial just because you've been running around town, keeping us from our targets. Who the hell are you people? We are an organization of heroes. We protect America from the threat of asymmetrical warfare by providing intelligence and occasionally getting rid of human scum. Mercenaries. Hmm. I hate labels. So go ahead, ask your next question. I know you want to. Why am I here? Bingo. Why are you here? Hmm. Is it because you took out our best operative? No, we don't take any prisoners. We kill our enemies and we move on. Okay, so why then? The only reason that you're alive right now is because I believe that you can be useful. I checked you out. Your Delta, highly decorated, has a problem with authority. When authority does the wrong things. Touche. I have a proposition for you. The girl you're protecting, she's collateral damage. She witnessed our operative, taking out someone that desperately needed to be killed. He was an enemy of the State. She's just a kid who's she gonna tell? Shepherd, we operate in the shadows. As insignificant as that little girl is, she can bring us to the ground. Don't act like you don't understand that. So what's the proposition? You do a job for us and we'll leave her alone. What's the job? I'm sorry, was that a yes? One kill and you leave her alone forever. One kill The Target's name is Maximiliano Che. He is an international arms dealer specializing in biological weapons. How do I know you're not gonna just kill her anyway after I do this job for you? You don't, you roll the dice or she dies today. Up to you. Go on. We lost a man on our last mission. He was gathering Intel on Che until his cover was blown. Che, killed him in cold blood. However, we did find out what he was planning to sell and when. What we know is it's a weapon of mass destruction created by Eve Howell, American scientist. What we don't know is how it works and who he's planning to sell it to. So what's the play? Che is a ghost. Eve Howell, she's your best bet. That's where you need to start. You know what will happen if you fail. I won't. Hey, I'm Maxine. Shepherd. Here to support your operation. And well, used to work for the NSA but I was too forward thinking for them. I'm an anarchist, born in several countries. I'm mobile and don't have many friends. I don't buy it. I do. Here's your assault pack. Weapons, other useful gadgets. What's this? That is an acid bomb. Activate it, you have five seconds. So deactivate it. So am wearing a helmet camera or what? Do you wear contacts? No. Now you do. We watch your every move. I also took the Liberty of checking out the scientist. She'll be at the gala tomorrow. I'll be shutting off all of the electricity in her car and the rest is up to you. Any questions? My car got set up, can you give me a new one? What do you want? Lamborghini. We'll get yours fixed. What seems to be the problem? Let me guess, you're a mechanic? I know a little something. Pop the hood. I got you. Problem is definitely electrical. I was gonna have this with you. How about I call you a tow truck? You know what, I'm really in a hurry. Do you think you can give me a ride to my event? Well, it depends. You're not crazy or anything, are you? We all have our triggers, good and bad. I'll just have to stay on those good triggers now. Let's go. So if you don't mind my asking, what do you do for a living? I'm a secret agent. Mm hmm. What kind of missions? Mostly international stuff. I'm like the black female 007. Okay, we might run some of the same circles. Wow, you're gullible You have an honest face, okay? What can I say? I'm a scientist. A very boring scientist. I doubt that. It's true. I mean, don't get me wrong. I love my job and I guess it's just not what it used to be. Well, I can relate to that. My last job was like that. Really? Yeah. Is this one better? It's too early to tell. But right now, I really like my job. So yeah, when I first started I thought I was gonna change the world one scientific discovery at a time. I was hired to cure very powerful disease that I can't mention due to my nondisclosure agreement. And I found the cure but it was hidden from the public. Too much money in the treatment drugs. Exactly. And then I discovered an anti-aging formula that really worked and still it was suppressed. Wow. My latest discovery would make the entire world safer from extreme weather. I donated that one to the US government. That way, if they try to suppress it, I can still share it with the world. Sounds like a game changer. Yeah I hope so. I truly do. I just wanna, you know, leave my mark and do my part, you know. I do. I definitely do. The sedative worked. Nicely done. Didn't swallow any, did you? No sleeping on the job. I'm good. What do I do now? Old one. Old one? I'm running a program that analyzes her buying trends to determine most likely password choices. Almost there. Alright. Try capital S science girl one. I'm in, Wow. You need to be hacking banks. Who says I haven't? Okay, so what's next? All right, type in this code in the search bar Now hit Enter. Done. Good. I'm accessing her files now. Get out of there before she wakes up. Eve Howell, scientist. Eve was hired by the Department of Energy to create a device that would prevent a hurricane from reaching shore. The device creates a current inside the storm which effectively cancels out the hurricane. Unfortunately Howell's supposed contact turned out to be one of the Che's men, Nicholas Garner. Che's purpose of the device was always meant to be used as a weapon of mass destruction, sold to the highest bidder. A weather bomb. Deployed on land the device can destroy any structure within a 20 mile radius killing hundreds and thousands in the process. We believe Che has a buyer. We've identified his location as this house. Get in, get Che and get out. And don't get caught. Excuse me, but can I help you? Probably. Will you? That is the question. I'm here with my husband. Oh, I know. Happy anniversary. Look I'm gonna call security. Someone's gonna kill the man you're in love with. My husband, why? Not your husband, the man you're in love with. The man you spent last night with on your supposed business trip. What do you want? Just some honest conversation between two people with a lot of secrets. Well, talk fast. He'll be back in a minute. He's got a lot of body guards, a lot body guards. But when death comes for Reyes, it wont come when he's surrounded by his body guards it will come when he's at his most vulnerable. Can you imagine when he's at his most vulnerable? When he's with me? Bingo. See, the thing is death doesn't like witnesses. So what do you think that means for you? They'll kill me too. Indeed. So I guess this is where your story ends. What a waste. Unless, unless you tell me exactly where and when Reyes will be alone and vulnerable. I'll find a way. Text me at this number when you do. I don't even know your name. Trust me, you're better off not knowing. I thought teenagers were supposed to be good at video games? Looks like your fears are about to get disappointed. Don't worry about me, old man. Old man? I'm just giving you a false sense of security before I break you. Really? Really, watch it. Well, this old man is feeling pretty secure right now. So I guess it's working. Hello? Yes. Hey dad, it's me. David. Let me talk to him. Hi David. I just wanted to tell you thanks. I know you don't have to do this but well, that's it I guess. David, your little friend told me everything. Yeah, it's been a complicated day. How the heck did you get yourself mixed up in all this mess? I'm just trying to do the right thing, dad. The right thing? Who are these people? Can't tell you that. Well, tell me, are we in any danger? Not if I do what they asked me to do. Well, what are they asking you to do? I can't tell you that either. Alright David, just, be careful out there, all right? David? Hey Shepherd. Yeah. Don't shoot the bomb. You see him shooting at me, right? Kevlar vest is fortified to deal with pistols so you can take it. As long as I don't get shot in the face. Exactly. Titanium crystals my ass that shit hurt. Cant believe you fell for that one. I'm starting to not like you. Mumbles. Maxine, that sound is coming from that device. Is that normal? I don't know. It's counting down. How do I stop it? I don't know. You don't know? That's literally your only job. I'm a hacker not a wizard. It's not built with any deactivation feature. The only person who will know is... Eve. Hello David, so nice to hear from you. You got a moment? Yeah, sure. What's going on? So I really don't know how to say this but I need your help. So I'm just gonna say it. That's how I like it. Raw and real Hello. Eve, I'm a spy. Well, the government agent kind of. Okay, I get it. You're trying to get me back for that secret agent joke. Very funny. No Eve, not funny. The device that you created for the Department of Energy to save people from hurricanes is being weaponized on land to produce mass casualties. I was hired to stop the sale from happening. And I did that but I accidentally triggered the five minute timer. If you don't help me a hundred thousand people are gonna die. Including us. Did you just say five minute timer? How could you possibly know that? Because I'm telling the truth. Okay listen, you won't be able to open the case without an authorized hand print. There's a rectangular section on the side of the case. That will activate it. Okay, one sec. Wait, don't move the device. If you move it, it will self-destruct and override the timer. Okay. All right, I have the print. Now what? Okay. Gently, gently open the case. Listen, do not move that case from its current position. No pressure. Okay, here we go. It made a different noise but it's still counting down. Okay, that's fine. It just means you have 90 seconds to enter in the deactivation code. You can only enter it in one time. So you can't miss a number. Understand? Okay, yeah I got it. Let's go. The 12 digit code is seven, two. Eve. Eve. Eve. Any ideas? I got nothing. Okay, what was the passport on the laptop? Signscore1. That's 12 characters. So we just need to assign a number to each character that's not a number. Well, if we go by the phone that's three to four possibilities for a number. But we can run a personality test using the buying trends and see what I come up with. 30 seconds. Okay. Got it. Type this in, nine, eight, five, three, seven, seven, seven, eight, nine, six, seven, one. Hi. Delivery from Ms Yvonne. Okay, thank you. This video was sent to us an hour ago. Why? Who are they? They work for the would-be buyer of the device that you intercepted. They will torture her until she agrees to manufacture another device. She won't do it. How do you know? Eve is... She's a true believer. She's on some Zen shit. Something about every person has a role to play in this world. Now that she knows that the device won't be used to save lives she won't recreate it. She will die soon. No, she's not. Where are they taking her? Columbia. Passport with your alias, plane tickets and a photo of Reyes. You sending a team with me? No. This mission is unsanctioned. The US government hired us to neutralize the threat of attack by eliminating Che. Disarming the bomb, that was a bonus but that'll keep us in business. It's an added value if you will. But saving Eve Howell, that is not a priority on the US government list at this time. But if she was to make... As such, we have to limit our exposure in case something goes wrong. Unfortunately, that's all the support I can give you at this time. Happy hunting. Also. What's this? Cyanide. The government has no connection to you and has no authority to act against Reyes. Reyes is ex CIA. He's a master interrogator. He'll make you wish for death for years only to kill you after you tell him what he wants to know. If you're captured, take the pill. You lost me? Yvonne's sends her regards. So what can the CIA do for Yvonne and her team today? I see. You know I do a lot of business with Reyes. Is Yvonne prepared to compensate me for my losses? Check your bank account. Now you're talking my language. I need weapons and a location. He's not gonna be an easy mark, you know. I'm not expecting one. He and his men recently acquired a scientist. So I'm guessing you want her back. I'll get you what you need. Like it? It's a bit dusty, needs some cleaning but it had its charm. We are in a wartime bunker. This is designed to protect politicians, presidents and the elite of my country. We're 10 stories underground. This is one of the safest places in the world and the last place anybody will ever find you. So? You're the fine one, aren't you? Let me make this easy on me. I'm not gonna make you the bomb and that's it. You fooled me once but now that I know what you plan to do with the device, I'd rather die. The value of my life is defined... By the good that we do in the world, blah, blah, blah. I know what you're gonna say. I've read your best selling science book and it's boring. It's boring as hell. Teaches all Indeed my dear, indeed. So if you know I'm not gonna build the bomb how come you just get it over with? Your boss is gonna make you torture me until I die. So you think you've got it all figured out, huh? I watch a lot of movies. Well, that's where you're wrong. I don't have a boss. I am the boss. In fact, my media company has helped elect the past three presidents. And for my next trick I'm gonna get myself elected President. The only thing standing in the way is your government supporting another candidate. He's a puppet He's a pun. I am not a pun And the first thing I would do as President is release my country from US economic and political influence. And you're gonna help me by delivering a credible and devastating threat, your device. Why don't you just take the $50 million? The offer is still on the table. It's for you. Use that to buy some breath mints. Very well. Look around, in this room are all the components needed for you to finish the device. It needs to get done. Do you understand? We'll be watching and you were right about one thing, if you don't complete it, you will die of starvation. You want me to finish him boss? No, no, no, no, no. Your never give you my bomb. I want you to go to the US and give me my money. I'll take care of this guy. Now, this is nice. This is a nice surprise. My CIA contact told me I might go to visitor. And I thought who would be so stupid to come look for me? But I know now that this, this is personal. I know you're looking for Eve. I don't know what you see in her. She's hard to work with. One thing's for sure, She loves pain and I think that's very sexy. Did I cut your nerve? Don't worry about it. You'll never find her. She's at a place that nobody will ever find her, okay? I've always liked baseball but you know what? Football has always been my sport. But again like they say, it's never too late to learn, huh? So if you're not with a CIA. You're here alone. And that means you're a man in the know and you must have the information that I need. I need you to tell me everything. All of it. Eve. Is she safe? How did you... Cyber spy anarchist, shepherd. Give me a break. She's not here. Where is Reyes? Dead. Okay, give me a sec. Reyes has 10 properties but most of them are commercial and the building scans are showing no hidden rooms, no trap doors, trick, walls, nothing like that. I'm sorry Shepherd, there's nothing I can do. Maxine, are any of his buildings built on top of older structures? Checking. Jackpot. His television studio is built on the site of an underground bunker. That has to be when they're keeping her. And how do I get there? There's has to be an anomaly somewhere but you don't see. Here we go. There's a private elevator. That has to be it. Send me the coordinates. I'm on my way. Okay, but I don't work pro bono. You survive this you better get a job so you can pay my fee. You know where to find me. 10 seconds. All right, copy that. Welcome to Reyes's studio. AKA propaganda TV. Wait. Two on patrol. I thought you said this was lightly guarded? It is, it just happens to be bad timing. Go now. Shepherd, you're about to lose the connection. The signal is getting weak. I'm sending you the coordinates of the elevator to your phone. Watch your six. Copy that. Eve. Eve. Eve. Eve. Shepherd. Yeah it's me, Eve. You're safe now. Get me out of here before I eat you. I can tell that you're new to this. So let me explain it to you. Everything's business. Nothing's personal. You pay more than he does and you get more. You get it? So now you have leverage on me. So here, how about this for an offer? I'll pass. I don't like empty promises.
