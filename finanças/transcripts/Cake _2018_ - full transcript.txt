There is so much left to see. I've already seen a lot. I can't recall most of it. If we could rewrite the past we wouldn't have to live in constant fear of the future. We wouldn't have been constantly waiting for change. I don't know how you do it, Romeo. I see no beauty in sorrow. Yours truly... Juliet. Zareen! Zareen! Will you come here after I'm dead? Yes! Yes, I'll speak to Dad. I know that. Yes, I'll be there on Monday. See you later. Goodbye. You're up quite early. Early? I haven't slept at all. I was here at four. You were snoring. I was not snoring. It must have been him. -My medicines are not working. -I think you were the one snoring. You need to get your ears checked. I don't snore. He does! It was her, for sure. She's on twenty tranquilizers. Enough! You keep me up all night and talk nonsense in the morning. -You'll be moving upstairs today. -I'll gladly move. -Take him right now. -That is not possible. I'll go to the village and work there. How does that sound? No way. You're not going there. I'm going there on Monday. A girl managing the land? No way. That's not your responsibility. When has responsibility ever been determined by gender? I can handle the responsibilities very well. You don't go there because of your breathing problem. He has no issues with his breathing. -He's stuck to that mask. -Want me to get stuck to you? Are you listening to this? He's always annoying me. Give it to me. -Give it back. -No... -Give it to me. -Let it go. -My blood pressure is high! -Have them after breakfast. -Tell her... -Relax! -She only needs to look after you. -Listen to me! -I can take care of myself. -Your blood pressure shoots up. -I don't need her. -Nothing's wrong with you. She keeps telling me not to have those pills. I have severe pain all over my body. I'm going to kill her. I'll make sure she has all my pills. Ten days ago we faced the same issue. You said that there was a gas leak. We got it checked. But it's the same issue all over again. His stomach was upset. The young one always wants to talk first. Talk to me. Why are you doing that? Fabulous, Grandma! A floor mop attached. With UV light and a touch control panel. Not just one, two or three. Get an entire set of five brushes. It's normal. Impossible. Check it again. Out of the seven acres, four acres have been worked upon. The harvest for the remaining three is underway. We'll be using some urea for it. We'll be done in another three months. Then we can send it off to the mills. -Are the workers happy? -Yes, they are. Dear, Juliet. We've seen flowers grow in the wilderness. We've experienced the clarity of vision that follows the tears. Now it's time to let hope back in. Let the passion back in. Only our dreams can release us from this burden that we've carried for so long. But what do we do if our dreams become burdens? Yes, Mom? Hello. Siraj Jamani. He is in the ICU. How is he? He's much better. What happened to him? Water had entered his lungs. Is he out of danger? His heart muscles are weak. He's at a greater risk of a cardiac arrest. Can I meet him? Put that on the vibrate mode. -How's Dad? -He's better. Good. Can I see him? Zain, FaceTime in the ICU? -Call Zareen. -He should be calling me up. Shall we come? Araiz will have to take time off from school. Zareen says no. Now she's staring at me. Everything is absolutely fine. Again? We should come. Okay, everyone should come. Sana, Araiz. Do as you please. I'll call you and give you the details. I don't have the time to sanitize the whole of Karachi. I doubt they'll come, Zareen. For how long are you going to be here? A couple of weeks. I only get twenty days off in a year. We need to hire a nurse for Dad. For his personal needs. When you get home, tell Mom to call the agency. You need to sleep. I'll stay here. No, there is no need for that. -Zareen! -The driver is downstairs. You can just go to sleep. The patient is awake. If you want to meet him, you can. I'm dying to be hugged by you Embrace me Monica Monica Tell Ghulab to make me some chicken soup. My child! Mom! You've fired the gardener again? The bastard was robbing me. Mom, language! Speaking of bastards, did you meet your father? No, but I saw him. He's fine. They'll shift him to the room today, and discharge him in a couple of days. I know that. I am not getting rid of him that easily. Why didn't Adnan come along? This time, even you've come home after a while. Don't tighten it too much, it will break. You have to tighten it, otherwise it won't stay in its place. It's okay, Mom. We have to keep him elevated. He cannot lie down straight. But if he doesn't sleep with me, his heart rate drops. Oh, Mom! Nothing will happen to him. Hold it from both sides. Come on. Easy. You can help him as well. Come in. He's here. Are you okay, Dad? Shower flowers over him My beloved has come home My beloved has come home Shower flowers over him My beloved has come home My beloved has come home Sing sweet melodies My beloved has come home My beloved has come home Stay right there. Is this working? Is the battery in? -It's working. -Can you hear me? Keep quiet. No one's asking you. Were you planning to leave me alone? -Bastard. -Mom! I'll get the food out. Have they assembled Dad's bed? They were working on it. Are you done? Yes. If we want to adjust-- The lever is right there. You just have to adjust it. All the stars need to come down And adorn me My beloved has come home My beloved By the way, Zain had called again. He wanted to come home. But Zareen said no. What is her problem? Just give him a call. Are you okay? Just keep it here. Mom I don't eat meat, I'm vegan. Have you lost your mind? -What's that? -Vegan. Why is Romeo here? What do you mean? -I asked you to call the agency. -After so many years-- I didn't ask you to call Romeo. He has a job at the hospital. I don't trust the employees of the agency. I trust Romeo. And we'll pay him. -Wow! Why did he become a nurse? -Obviously, we'll pay him. Because it makes him happy. And please stop being rude to Dad. Rude? I'm not rude. What's wrong with you? -I can see that. -Hey, monkey. Wow. Looking good! Why would you call someone a monkey? -I've been doing that since we were kids. -You are rude. Habiba shouldn't have bothered you. Please don't say that, sir. You've always taken care of me. Please don't worry about anything. Oh my God. Is sir's nebil 2.5 mg or 5 mg? What? Oh, no! Why are you here? All that... Our... You've become even more judgmental. Judgmental? Really? Our emails have nothing to do with reality. Nothing at all! Here! You and me... This... I mean, it's not... Don't get upset with me. But... Why did you call Romeo over? He was there when things got rough. Guardian of my world, listen Guardian of my world, listen Guardian of my world, listen You are the one Within you, somewhere My salvation lies You are the one Within you, somewhere My salvation lies Within you, somewhere My salvation lies Beyond this earth Beyond the skies Guardian of my world, listen Why are you doing this yourself, Zareen? Shall I help you, Zareen? Help? You guys are caught up in your lives. What are you going to help me with? Oh, it has started! Your self-pitying propaganda. I am looking after the land, running the house, taking care of our parents. Shall I help you? Why? Why are you going to help me? What is your problem? My problem is that I know how to change the tire. I know where the lawyer's office is and how to pay the bills. -I know what congestive heart failure is! -Keep going. Now, listen to me. Going to London was not my choice. Yes, but staying there was your choice. But all your issues have got nothing to do with me. Ever since I came home, I've had enough of your bullshit. Tell me that you need my help. Fine, don't say anything. Come here. First say sorry. Why have we still kept this car? In this house, things stay... and people end up leaving. You're coming out with me tonight. The entire world sleeps I stay awake Listening to my old man snoring Mom! Moonlit nights... Why am I not getting more followers? I've put up such great pictures. -I look glamorous. -I like it. Blonde suits me very well. My salvation lies Tell your stupid friends to like my picture. I don't care if you like it. Tell other people to like it. Come quickly. Zara, is it okay? Yes, Mom. Here. -Dad, sit down. -Smile for the camera. I hope you don't mind. -Romeo? -Hold it properly. Is everyone in? -Perfect. Click it. -Mom... -You have long arms. -Hurry up, Mom. You've brought me to this stupid party. You're wearing fur. I'm hungry already. Yes, let's go. Mom and Dad are alone at home. Zareen, Romeo is staying for the night. Don't you get anxious at home? That anxiety is nothing compared to this social anxiety. Do you think they have food here? What is this? Hold this. We are screwed. Zara! I'm glad you are here. -Zareen! Come with me. -Oh, Auntie Lulu. Greetings. -We don't have much time. -Hold on. No. Please come with me. I want you to meet someone. This is Asim. Asim, this is Zareen. You can meet her now. Samar! Wow, one more! How many kids do you have? Third one on the way! I'll come. Don't just say that. Where's the husband? Home. Home? What does a home mean to people who live overseas? Zareen. Zareen, letâ€™s go. Excuse me, we are in the middle of a conversation. Don't waste your time. Hold on, Zara. What happened? Speak up. First, give me a cigarette. Cigarette? I don't smoke. I don't smoke. -Where's the lighter? -I don't have a lighter. What kind of a smoker doesn't keep a lighter? Thank you. There are a lot of people here. Be careful. I don't care. There are aunties around. "What does home mean to you?" Who said what? -What? -Shehryar! Who else could it be? Shehryar's here? Really? I was about to have a drumstick. I don't have meat anymore. Why was I having a drumstick? Forget about the drumstick. Tell me what happened in there. Did he say anything about the past? No, he didn't say anything. He should have replied and understood the situation. Same people. Same issues. All that bullshit about marriage and children. Okay, stop. Breathe. Give this to me. Breathe, okay. Divert my attention. What? -Distract me. Divert my attention. -How? The first thing that comes to your mind. First thing on my mind? Zareen, speak about something that's bothering you. Romeo! Ma'am, your car keys. Romeo? Romeo? The one whom I call "monkey"? Give it to me. Well... There's something between us. Are you guys in love? Somewhat. His words... make everything a little less difficult. Wow! You are not that innocent, after all. Romeo? Zara. I wonder why you think so. Zara? What happened? -What happened? -Nothing. Just stop the car. -Why? -Stop the car! Auntie Lulu's house is on the left. Which one is it? -It's on the left. -Give it to me. This one. Zareen, keep driving. I can't believe I egged someone's house. This was not my idea, it was yours. It's your turn now. Go on. -Shall I? -Do it! -Shall we stop? -We've finished an entire box. -The last one. Let's do it for Zain. -Okay. What is it? You... You and your crush on our long forgotten catholic friend. This is not a crush. Hey! Do you remember George Clooney? You used to collect those things. And you used to have that tacky folder. -The pink folder. -Please stop. You used to stick his pictures on it. With those UHU glue sticks. -UHU glue sticks. -It had a great smell. -You used to draw those little... -Hearts. -Drawing hearts over them. -Yes. You didn't just stick them on. Such a fool! So? What about you and Adnan? I don't know. I want to go to the farmhouse this time. I want to meet that kid. The one who met with an accident. He must have grown up. They don't live there anymore. -Really? -Yes. I still want to go there. Sometimes, a nurse. Sometimes, a handyman. I've visited over the years, and you've never even come to say hello. Hospital. Life. You know how it is. You don't visit very often either. Lies! Don't believe anything they say. Can I talk to you about something? Yes? Zareen still thinks about the baking school in Paris. Yes. Le Cordon Bleu. Zareen and her dreams of becoming a baker! I'm filling out her application form. I see. And... Does Zareen know about this? She won't let me do it. I've already tried. But now that you're back, I thought I should give it another chance. I can't stay back for that long. If we don't value someone's dreams... it doesn't mean that their dreams don't have any value. You've always been like this. He who makes my dreams come true He makes everything possible I belong to him I belong to him I belong to him I belong to him Truth is the melody That belongs to centuries It resides inside us Truth is the melody That belongs to centuries It resides inside us I belong to him If you didn't want to buy anything why were you insisting on coming? Why? You wanted to be alone with him? What is with the torn sock? Wind. It feels good against my toes. It has its own thrill. You should try wearing ripped socks. Feel the wind. These little things are all that matter. Ice lolly. Sore throat. Toys. Childishness. Pink nail polish. A buttoned, checked shirt that doesn't have full sleeves. Home. That's enough. Please. Even after fifty years, when my old man gets up in the morning I pull his cheeks. I pinch his ass. Do you ever pinch Adnan's ass? No. Then, leave him. End the relationship. Five years! Wow. Time to have one now. Seriously, kids are the best. I mean, your life changes completely. Only after becoming a mother, I have realized my value. I finally feel significant. He didn't want children? I didn't want them. Why do people want children? For support during old age? The idea is a little selfish, don't you think? That's also something quite selfish. You think your biology and your genetics are a gift to the world? Okay, forget all of that. How can you be so sure that you can protect your child from all the sadness and grief in this world? How can anyone take on such a huge responsibility? What? Nothing. Say it. You still have commitment issues. You're only thinking about yourself. I didn't have the courage to write all the details in the letter. The accident had a great impact on me. Which accident? What do you mean by that? Back in the village. Zareen told you, didn't she? No. What are you saying? Have you forgotten? Did Zareen tell you why I left? Zareen told me that there was some family emergency. And she handed me your letter. I had been to the farmhouse after the gap year. I took the car out late one night. It was dark and a-- You really don't know anything? What? I hit a boy with the car and... But he was fine. Nothing happened to him. But in that moment, I panicked. I got scared and I ran away. I drove in the fourth gear and escaped as fast as I could. Dad was very anxious and I couldn't say no to him. My UCL acceptance had already come through and I had to go. Everything happened very quickly. I thought Zareen would fill you in and then you'd write to me. As the decision was yours, you had to do the writing. I'm really sorry about what happened, but... Me and you. That was another matter. Anyway. Zareen should have told you everything. Let me take this route in. What is going on? Why are you sitting here with the doors closed? Well, I'm sorry. Hello. This is Romeo. Yes, I remember. Romeo! -Your childhood friend. -Yes. This was for him. Well done. Even I give new clothes to all my servants every month. -How have you been? -I don't even know where to begin. -Guess what happened on New Yearâ€™s Eve? -What? Some hooligans threw eggs all over my house. Must be the school kids. -What's this? -My father. When he was around, he used to wear shirts like these. This is the only way I can keep his memories alive. I was just kidding. This is not about a ripped sock or a checked shirt though, is it? Then what is it about? What is it about? -It's about your thinking. -My thinking? You think that you and I can never be together. And no matter how much I try... I may never be able to change how you think. I don't understand what you're saying. This was easier for you, when I was away. Sir knows that I need to leave early today. Why didn't you tell Shehryar about the accident? Zareen? It wasn't necessary to tell him about the accident. I told you that you need to tell him once everything was resolved. -Honestly, I don't remember. -How is that possible? What is Dad's exact age? What? Every year they fight about his age. -I'm talking to you about something else. -I don't remember! Ten years have passed. It was a long time ago. I had to give him the letter. I did that! I told him that Dad sent you away. -What difference do the details make? -Difference? You shouldn't have told him. I don't care, Zara. He didn't want to wait for you. Damn it! No, tails. No, wait. -Sure? -Sure. It's better this way. At least in Karachi, the children will come to visit us. Both of us want to live in the village. Think about it. We'll have a lot of space out there. What do you think? Habiba. I'm your husband. But the kids have their own lives. I love you, bastard. But some grievances will last a lifetime. We did it. We did what we had to do. We were wrong. It's loose. -Mom, you can take that off. -Oh, she's here! -We've changed. -Tortoise? -She is very slow. -Letâ€™s do this. Start the game. When we win -you can take all of Zareen's things. -You won't win. What do I have in the storage? It's all yours. I saved it for your wedding. -Dad! -What do you think? Cutlery, crockery, linen, vacuum cleaner. All of that is not for me. I think you're losing your mind. I am not getting married. Let me tell you something, kiddo. No matter how colorful the pill is it only works before the expiry date. You should find someone before your expiry date. Right. I'll take care of this old man. Who'll take care of you? She's done it. How did she do that? -Hold on. -The next round? -Keep quiet. -No, no. -Mom, don't say anything. -No... You just farted in front of your daughters. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I can't believe you just used that word. But he is farting. -Again? -Stop this nonsense. In front of his daughters, in front of his wife! What kind of a husband is he? -Do it discreetly. -Give him some water. It's like he's a fart machine. Here, have some water. -Fart machine. -Come on! -This doesn't suit you. -She's not going to stop. What kind of a husband do I have? Unbelievable! Water retention causes gas. You shouldn't have eaten all that cauliflower. Go sleep in your bed. Your voice is crackling now. Don't forget that you are my prisoner. Do you remember the first time you came to see me? You were extremely poised. You were concerned about the coaster under the cup instead of the tea inside it. Etiquette is really important. But eventually, we tend to forget all of it. Over the years, we stop being sophisticated. Are you pretending to sleep? Why aren't you snoring? Go to sleep. Your throat is already sore. Oh God! I thought you died. Please pray for her healthy recovery. As per your wish... I gave them the permission to bring her home. But... you need to decide. We should... We should start preparing. That's what I'm doing. Monica He has come Look, he is here All of you are familiar with Habiba's rude demeanor. If she could talk right now, she'd hurl abuses at all of you. "You stupid idiots!" "I am not dead." "I'm just catching up on my sleep." Dad! It's our wedding anniversary next week. We'll celebrate it at the farmhouse. All of you are invited. -Don't touch me. -Dad, please stop. All of you have to come. You must come. What is he doing? Why is he behaving like that? I don't understand. We're going to the village. The doctors are here. Mom is not in a state to-- She feels everything. She understands everything. I know it! She understands everything. We're going to the village. You wish to do something... To hell with that! We'll arrange for another nurse. Why? Romeo is going to stay back. Romeo is coming with us. When the red flowers bloom Over the branches Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet When the red flowers bloom Over the branches Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Dear God When the birds return Dear God Dear God When the birds return And fly around And fly around noisily Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Dear God When the tears run down the cheeks Dear God Dear God When the tears run down the cheeks And turn into pearls Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Are you ready to go down this unknown path? Mom? This is not going to fit in. The suitcase won't fit in. It's too big. Yes, it's quite big. Take this one out and keep the other one. You've kept the small one at the back. This one. -If there is an issue with the catheter-- -Yes, I know. I've explained everything to Romeo. Okay. Mr. Dino! This one? Keep this in the other car. This one won't fit. Zain. Has Uncle Suleiman arranged everything? Yes. Is there an oxygen tank inside the ambulance? Yes, that's there. Let's go. Not there. We are not traveling in this car. Dad. Dad, we need to get into Zareen's car. I'm going to stay right here. Hurry up. I'm sitting in the ambulance with Mom. To go back after all this time... What if the villagers say something? Let them. All of us have to return someday. Why aren't you in the car? I'm afraid to sit inside that car. Zara. Sometimes, the only way to move forward is to make peace with the past. Are you talking about the accident? I'm talking about life. Can you find out where the boy and his family live? You could have held it for two minutes. I would have wet myself. Dreams. Le Cordon Bleu. Zara and I-- Zara and you! I thought you'd be-- That I'd be happy? That I'd be indebted to you? Until when? This is not your responsibility. No, Adnan. It's just my share of the flat. Did you do this? Why? The rest... Why did you do this? -What is it? -This! Why? I thought it was a good idea, Zareen. What about Mom, Dad, and the land? You'll finally fulfill your dreams. The more I try to forget about it, the more all of you-- Does it scare you? What? What do you mean? All of us will be just fine without you. That's what scares you. Is that what you think? Yes, Zareen. Or is it about him? Do you know about them? What do you know? What do you know? -So come back then. -Let's go, son. The eldest son! Eldest son, my ass. His dreams, her dreams, his decisions. I'm stuck in between! I'm here. My job is at stake. Why isn't that enough for you? Because I don't want you to come back and ruin our lives once again. Are you done? Did he use the restroom? He did. The roots of these lush trees Turn into snakes at nightfall The roots of these lush trees Turn into snakes at nightfall Oh lord, I plead When I'm without my clan Please guide me on this journey Oh dear mother I'm yearning for my beloved Oh dear mother I'm yearning for my beloved I'm yearning for my beloved Dear God Listen to my prayer I'm yearning for my beloved Hello, everyone. -I'm fine. Are all of you okay? -Yes, indeed. -Greetings. -Greetings. -Are you done with the harvest? -Yes. -All okay? -Yes. My son. Good to see you. The work is still ongoing on the land uphill. That's nice. Please teach your son some Urdu. Have you ordered cake for the party? No. You're going to bake it. I won't do that. Zareen, if you don't bake the cake I'm going to lock you in a room with Sana. Being locked with Sana? You're making fun of my son. You used to call butterflies butter flowers. "Mom, I've sketched butter flowers." I'm yearning for my beloved Oh dear mother I'm yearning for my beloved I'm yearning for my beloved Oh sisters, here's what Shah Latif says Dear God Latif says The lovers have taken their first step The lovers have taken their first step Oh dear mother I'm yearning for my beloved -Greetings. -Greetings. -I need some candles. -How many? -Three packets. -Okay. How much? Hundred rupees. Here you go. Thank you. Don't give him anything next time. Okay. Why did Sayein bring them here? No idea. Araiz. You were really young when we last saw you. You've grown up. -Greetings. -Greetings. There is shortage of water. Where's the guest of honor? Dad will be here any moment. Happy wedding anniversary, Habiba. -Ma'am. -Yes? Sir wanted to get his wedding china out. -I can't find it anywhere. -Zareen knows-- I'll go check in the store room. Greetings. -Are you keeping well? -Yes. Bitch. Where's Zara? Must be around, Dad. Take this. This... This auburn wig is her favorite. I bet she's very excited right now. She wants... to... Well, no. First it shall be me. Then, it will be her. She wants to be buried here. In our village. Everything that we achieved, came from here. Maybe that's why. I am stubborn. I... told Habiba. I told her that we will be buried in Karachi. My loving children... My... successful children. My global children. If they'd like to meet us on the occasion of Eid... it would be difficult for them to come all the way here. That is why I wanted to forget about the village. I was okay with Karachi. I always thought about the family and togetherness. I wonder why. After gaining We have to lose something After... After losing We gain something You win some, you lose some That's life -To hell with their opinions! -What? Nothing. From a couple of moments We have to steal an entire lifetime Life is nothing else But you and me When I left, why didn't you try to get hold of me? I did. I even asked Zareen for your number. She said you wanted me to stay away. Why did you say that you got my letter? Hold on. I left a letter for you. Yes. Zareen gave it to me. What are you saying? Did you find the plates? -You didn't find them? -Get out of here. What was written in that letter? That we don't have a future together. You want to experience life on your own. Without me. You were crying like a child in front of the guests. What will people say? Have you lost your mind? Screw you! Sir, please stop. -You're such a moron! -Sir... I told you guys not to do this. He's not at the party. Where's Zara? Sir is... What happened? See it for yourself. What do you mean? What's the matter? Dad? What is this? Come on. These are my children. I hope you remember them. You played with them when they were kids. This one. She walks around with a lot of bitterness in her heart. What do you mean? And, this one. What has he done, after all? Dad, that's enough. You guys can leave. Where are you going? Dad, what's wrong with you? Don't touch me. What have you done, after all? What have you done for us? You are being childish. Yes, I'm childish. You were once a child. Now, I'm a child to you. We've done a lot for you. And I'm grateful. Don't be grateful. You don't need to be grateful. We need your presence here! -We need you. Before we die-- -I've always been here. -Why are you dragging me into this? -There you are! Let go of my hair, Zara! Why are you doing this? -Are you mad? The guests are here! -What's wrong with you? Oh, hello. Is everything okay? Yes, everything is okay. -You're not normal. -Really? You guys behave like animals! You're no saint. You pulled my hair out! Why didn't you give him my letter? -Which letter? -Which letter? You think I am a bitter person? I did exactly what you asked me to do. You shouldn't have. Just take him inside. -Please, Dad. Go inside. -I won't. She ran away, and now it's all my fault. Oh shut up, Zareen. -Answer my question! -Sir, please come with me. The ear plugs are in the bag. All of you are extremely condescending and patronizing. I'm not upset. I am confused. -Araiz is sleeping. -What kind of a family is this? This is my family, Sana. It's amazing how your guilt works. My guilt? My guilt? Listen to me. -Dad can move in with us after Mom. -After Mom? Mom is still alive! If there is a requirement. Dad living away from his home. That sounds appropriate to you? I can't do this any longer, Zain. I'm booking flight tickets for New York. That's home to me and our son. You are free to do as you please. He is our son! That's out home, Sana. Hold it carefully, it's heavy. Let's go. Is there enough petrol? -Check the generator. -Sure, sir. Be quick! Come on... Zara! Zara? What letter? What letter? When the time is right, Zareen will give you all the details. But for now, I have to go. Please wait for me. What letter? This letter, Zareen! You told me that you gave my letter to Shehryar. You didn't! You told me that all my messages were passed to him. You told me that he was okay with letting me go. Is that all he said? The guests outside... You like them a little younger, don't you? -Wanted him for yourself? -Say something! I can't do this any longer. We should go outside. I never wanted them to come back. Now, speak up! Zara, I'll explain everything later. Do you know about this? No, right? I was already in America. Zain, don't! Not you! Dad will speak up. Why are you bringing Dad into this? Zareen, you copied my handwriting and sent him a fake letter. Why? Siraj! What is this? This is not the right time to fight. Please step outside. For how long will you try and cover this up? Come back, Zareen. Come back. Zareen, I want the truth. Now! Guess who else wants the truth? The parents who lost everything that night. Zareen, don't do this! Tell her, Dad. Or I will! Zareen! Zareen, I'm going. No, you stay right here. What are you trying to say? Mom wanted you to tell her everything. Speak up. Now is the time! What is it, Dad? Dad? We told you that we gave him money for his treatment. The boy's family never took the money. What do you mean? What do you mean? We were... We were offering them... Diya. What are you saying? Dad, what is she saying? -Zareen, what are you saying? -What am I saying, after all! What am I saying? What do you think I'm saying? Here's what I am saying, Zara! He died! No treatment! What do you think I'm saying? But he was in the hospital. Dad said he was stable. I wanted to meet him. I really wanted to! -He was a little boy. -Try and understand. Understand what, Dad? Understand what? What do I need to understand? That... You told me he was back to school. You told me that you'll take care of him, he is stable and that you will keep supporting him. He was just a kid, Dad! Why did you lie? Why? Tell her everything. Tell her everything, Dad. What else? Why do you always keep avoiding this? What else? -What? -They never accepted the blood money. After you left, it was all a mess. Lawyers had entered the scene, they wanted to fight the case. It was a huge ruckus. The press got involved. They said that someone had to be punished. No one had seen you. But some of the villagers had noticed our car's license plate. A case was filed in the court. Who? Against whom? A case against whom? I wasn't even here. For some time, someone had to go. But he's okay. Everything is fine right now. We got the sentence reduced. Romeo came because I called him here. But he offered himself. For how long? Four years. Four years? We were out of options. You had gone by then. We did whatever we felt was right. "Whatever you felt was right." Right! Were you out of your mind? Are you out of your mind? How could you let them do this to you? Why? Was I fond of running away, Mom? Me? -I wanted to run away? -Zara, step away! What happened? You used to say that your love is true, not blind. Step away, Zara! -Please leave. -She said so. She can't be a typical mother who has unconditional love for her children. What happened, Mom? She's the decision maker in the house. She could have stopped Dad. You would have gone to prison? You would have gone to prison? Answer me. That would have been my decision. My decision. In your attempt to be a good father you became such a disgusting human being. So disgusting! If you wanted the truth, you should have looked a little harder. We sent you away in a rush. I thought about it. But you guys had answers for everything. -And you believed everything. -Yes, I did. It was convenient for you. Values! Nobody cares about such things. Now you are here. So, go and ask for forgiveness. Tell them to send you to prison. That's it. No point arguing. Mom is in a coma. Dad is severely ill. How can you defend them? Because I know very well that you didn't have the courage to face any of this! Zara. Keep calling Zara, Zain. I won't go to Paris. When I was in prison... The letters that you wrote to me... When you used to come to see me for ten minutes... Those precious moments... They meant everything to me. I want you to fulfill all your dreams. I won't go to Paris. There's a history of heart disease in the family, and you are still at it. Combine any two. It's totally safe. I don't smoke. On a day like this, you should. Romeo. If I asked you how life in prison was, what would your answer be? You can ask me any question except that. My father worked for your father until his last breath. Your family... All of you. I consider you as my family. Yes. Maybe it is a load of shit. But it's the only thing we have. What should I do? Zara. Zareen did what she was asked to do. But she sacrificed her love for you. Sacrificed my love? Everything was kept hidden from Zara. So her anger is justified. Yes. No doubt. It is justified. The two of you are around your mid-30s. Very close to your mid life-- We were just sixteen a while ago. Far away from your teenage years! Elder brother? The one who gets scared of his wife is asking us to grow up. Shut up, you witch. We are not talking about me and Sana. -We are talking about you. -Chicken! We like dragging you and Sana into everything. It gives us inner peace. I'm off to bed. Have this. If I had given Shehryar the letter... you would have known the truth. When you were two, I had tried to kill you. Not intentionally. I strangled you until you were blue in the face. It's very strange that I remember it so clearly! Dad came running, grabbed me, and threw me aside. He made sure you were okay. And he shook me really hard and said... "I don't care how you feel about her." "But you have to be a good sister to her." My love Come and meet me Her condition is critical. We should shift her to the ICU. We may have to put her on a ventilator. What is he saying? Why does she need to go to the ICU? She opened her eyes. She has fever, and her breathing is labored. At this stage, pneumonia and other complications are very common. If we take her to the hospital, just maybe... What? Maybe? What kind of a doctor is he? Where did you pick him up from, Zain? -Come on. -What does he mean? Her eyes are open. We'll take her to the hospital. Many people are on ventilators for years. No? Dad, don't just sit and nod. Why is he nodding his head, Zareen? Mom will wake up. On machines? Would Mom really want that? Have all of you gone mad? We should... Something... Are we supposed to do nothing? Let her go? She's ready to go now. You have the authority? Do you? And, Dad... You want to control everything now? We can't just keep staring at each other. Something needs to be done! Do you even know what happens on a ventilator? Of course, you're also a doctor now. We should have never brought her home. We should have kept her at the hospital. This is not about everything that went wrong in the past. Love that is true. Not love that is blind. How can we let her go, just like that? Just like that? My darling Please come and meet me My spirit turns into a flame of fire Come and quench my thirst I'm dying to be hugged by you Embrace me My darling My dear Please come and meet me My spirit turns into a flame of fire Come and quench my thirst I'm dying to be hugged by you Embrace me Monica Monica... All those promises... When the red flowers bloom Over the branches When the red flowers bloom Over the branches When the flowers will bloom Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet When the red flowers bloom Over the branches When the red flowers bloom Over the branches When the flowers will bloom When the flowers will bloom Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Dear God When the birds return Dear God When the birds return And fly around noisily And fly around noisily Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet Then, we shall meet When my soul returned...
