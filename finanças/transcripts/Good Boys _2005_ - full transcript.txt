- Excuse me, do you work here? - No. - But, maybe I can help you out. - I wanna buy a gift for my mom. Local Israeli music, maybe? Oh, excuse me. Hello? That'll get you a blow job, that's it. I thought we were pals. How about another 50? A fifty? My ass is really tired tonight, 50 just don't turn it on. But you already got a hundred for the blow job. You know I'm dying to fuck ya. I love your ass. 200 more, plus new shoes from your store. That's a lot of money. Do I look like some two-bit hooker? You know you're... a very special client, and... I'm very fond of your cock, and of its very special personality. Another 100? You're hurting my feelings. You treat me like some worthless piece of ass. You know exactly how much my ass is worth. If you don't make up your mind soon, you'll start paying for my time, too. - It was amazing. - Great. Come again. I will. It was great, so... so see you at my place next time. - Love you, OK? - Thanks. -Anytime. Goddamn muggers! You son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Asshole! Mugging women like that... You're half the man I am! Why do I deserve this? You cocksucker! Fucking cocksucker! Go fuck yourself! He said I was his shining star once, so I use that, I remind him that he said so. Think he loves you? If he loves me, why would he want to fuck me? His wife probably left him, or maybe some homosexual urges started surfacing in his old age. Those old guys, they want us to be caring, to love them. All they really want is to forget about their dead boyfriends. My trick today looked like his wife ran off with some guy from the gym. When I tell them I love them and care about them, they know it's a crock of shit. But 10 minutes with him are worth 400 shekels, that much is true. Beats another day at the office. - Hey there, babe. - Hello. It's practically morning, ain't you tired? - Are you worried about me? - Yes, I am. - Is your friend there taken? - Want me to call him over? I'm too tired for a fuck There's other stuff we could do. Bedroom's upstairs. I always use rubber. Follow me. - You want the money upfront? - Yeah. Take off his pants. Don't go up. Suck him. You don't have to. We can switch places. It's cool. OK, this is me. Wanna come up? - Thank you for your hospitality. - My pleasure. Hey, I gotta go, it's late. I'm fixing breakfast. You shouldn't have, I'm really in a rush. It's real tasty. - Thanks for the hospitality. - We could do it again. - Yeah, sometime. - Yeah. Right, well... - Bye. - Bye. When are we gonna do this again? Dunno. Find me at the Home Club. I'll be there. Thanks. How are you feeling? Better. It'll kill ya, in the end. Bring it on. What about work? I can't work with her around. - I'm leaving her at your place. - No way. I can't take care of her, she'd be better off with a social worker. I ain't giving my baby to no social worker. You've been living in the streets for a month now! She can't be sleeping in cardboard boxes. What are you gonna do when it starts raining? Maybe you should move back in with me? Dunno. Don't think that's such a good idea. I don't want the mother of my baby to be living in the streets. We can go find you a decent job tomorrow, waiting tables. And what about you, will you keep taking it up the ass? Never mind about me. You can't keep it up like this. What a good girl. Quiet. Her dad's a good boy, too. You think we're bad people because of what we do? Kind of obvious, ain't it? Let it ring, I don't wanna be alone. Maybe I could take you back to your folks? I ain't never going back there. Will they take care of her? - You know they don't want her. - Forget I said anything. You don't love me, do you? Sure I do. Liar. Right, I have to go, I got a date. Promise you won't touch anything. Promise... Liar. - Condom. - Don't need it. Please... Shut up! I was totally not into it, but he shelled out such a nice bundle, so I told him to give me a sec, to warm up, you diggin', babe? That hurts. That hurts, Menni. Why don't you ask some girl you know to walk ya home? You crazy? Half of those hookers are junkies, they'd mug me cold in a heartbeat. Why don't you come work next to me? No, I'm done with the strip. Got my own clientèle. You know how much work I've put into these tits? I've had it, I wanna cut it off, get it over with. Tomorrow or the day after, if business is slow, I'll come by. You are such a nice little faggot. Good God, I have no idea how you can keep this up. God has mysterious ways, who knows. Oh, no, let's not get into all that... Sure. You seem weird. Are you in love? Get out, you know I don't believe in love. Liar, you're in love. Who is he? - I ran all the way for you. - I got here not so long ago. Man, I'm bent out of shape. Can't open the door. We gotta quit smoking. It's bad for us. I can't even run like a normal person. - Aren't I attractive enough? - What? Where did that come from? You didn't want to sleep with me. If we're gonna stay good friends, we have to stop fucking. It'll kill our friendship. - You met a guy, huh? - Relax already. It's OK if you did, I'm not jealous. I know we're not an item. He's hooking too? His name's Menni. I think I know him. I sat next to him in a bar yesterday. We started talking just like that, as if we were old buddies. - Sounds great. - Romantic, ain't it? Yeah. What if you don't find him again? I ain't worried. Cause if you don't, you know where to find me. Where do you want it? Follow me. I will stick my cock in and pull it out exactly 100 times. I want you to... count out loud. While I hit you with this. With a Barbie doll? Three... - Four-... - Louder. Five! Six! - Seven! - Louder. Eight! Nine! Ten! Come sit, have something to drink. Let's talk a little bit. Thanks. You must be wondering why. I've stopped wondering a long time ago. That's kind of sad, isn't it. Trivial. If I start thinking about it, I'll lose focus of my entire life. Don't you want to know why? If it means that much to you, you can tell me why. Fine. Do you really want to know? I'm curious. You've got my interest. Please, do tell. Why? I try to find the sexual bridge between anguish and joy pain and pleasure. I use objects that give joy to children, such as the Barbie doll, and next time it could be another sort of doll. The objective is to create a ceremony of a malady. To put the defects of modern society out on display. All this whilst introducing excitement and enthusiasm to the anal-banal action, to hear the bells toll, to revive the debauchery, to breathe in the frolics. To no longer cry pathetically as knights impale you on their long lances which they go about carrying. To refine the cruelty so typical of living life through objects, which conjure up sweet memories. Tal! - Hey, what are you doing here? - Looking for Tal. Where is he? Must be selling Adams in the club, he goes early to make money. Did someone rough you up? Some cop caught me, but I ran. - Yeah, always happens to rookies. - Yeah, it's a real drag. You'll learn to spot the cops. Folks told me you can spot'em in three seconds. Maybe the old-timers can spot'em in three seconds. Regular clients, on the phone, that's the best. It's what I do. - Were you with Tal last night? - Yeah. I met him yesterday, you were all he could talk about. How much fun you guys had, on the same wavelength. Really? Yeah, he even said it was like a fairy tale. - You wouldn't be lying, now? - Why would I lie to you? Listen, the pain's killing me, I'll go lie down at my place. Come on, I got ice, I live right around here. What are you doing here? I need a room. Not with the baby. This is no place for a baby. What am I supposed to do with her now? Babies are bad for business! I hate you! Stop crying! What a stupid bitch... Come here, you can sit on the bed. - There. - Thanks. You got a client who likes to dress up like a baby? No. It belongs to my baby. Two and a half years ago I made the mistake of a lifetime by sleeping with a girl, and now we have a baby They were supposed to be here. I'm trying to get her to clean up, but she's a lost cause. Don't give up on her. Maybe she'll wise up and quit. So, are you straight? No, definitely not. - But I have had some slip-ups. - How do you mean? It means I can sleep with girls, depends on the pay. - I'm gay. - Are you, now? I didn't think otherwise. Listen, if you're a long way from home, you can spend the night. Mika probably won't be coming back. She usually takes off for a couple of days, till she runs out of dough or till she's just thrown out of her squat. You can change the sheets, and I'll go look for Tal. Do you want to fuck me in return? You're a cutie... Let's just stay friends, OK? My car's right here. I'm sort of standing someone up. It's just a fuck. You can come back later. If you have fun, you can stay the night.. Got poppers? Gummis? Wanna fuck me? - Is everything alright? - Yeah, everything's fine. - Want me to stop? - No, but cum quickly, I wanna go. What is it? Forget it. You're not into it. I can't fuck you unless you want it. What's your name? Daniel, don't you wanna fuck me? I do, but I think you're just trying to forget about something. This fuck won't help you forget anything. Right. I'll... 'll be leaving now. Can I buy you some coffee? You wanna buy me coffee... I think you need some coffee, and someone to talk to. You'll be missing out on the party. I come here every weekend. See anything interesting? Won't you come back to bed? We'll talk about it in the morning. Why didn't you tell me you were a cop? Because I wanted you to like me. Gay people don't like cops. Not at all. There's a whole fetish thing with the blues. Talk about it in the morning. I'm going. I have a problem with liars. And you're not a liar? I know you're a hooker, Tal, I've read your file. - I know you much better than you think. - Let go of me! You're not going anywhere. We're just getting started. You're gonna be my bitch. Go fuck yourself! You're gonna be my bitch, and you're gonna like it. Love ties you down. It keeps you from exploring yourself and finding the real you. Some would say, though that someone capable of love is a very brave person. - Or a total coward. - How do you mean? Someone who's always looking, afraid of being alone, maybe afraid of himself. Can I ask you a personal question? Depends on the question. What made you do what you did in the john? I was looking for a guy. A guy I've been with last night, that it could've lasted, so when I couldn't find him I felt that my dream was going up in smoke. I thought he could be the one. Maybe he is the one, but you haven't found him yet. But you don't believe in love. Might work out in your case. I doubt it. Why? What do you do? I work in an advertising agency. So you put out for money? We're not too fussy when it comes to money. Me neither. - What do you want? - When did you get a test? - We used a condom! - And what about the other bugs? I'm clean, OK? Now, let go of me. Listen. I'm sorry I'm freaked out, I have no right to judge you. It's OK, I'm used to it. I didn't see it coming, how do you expect me to react? It took me by surprise. You don't look like a hooker, you have a really nice face. You have a real good personality, and the way you dress... Thanks for the coffee, now let go of me. OK? - I'm trying to apologize here... - I should be thanking you. You reminded me I can't socialize. That I can't trust anybody. I'm not ashamed of what I do. I have nice clothes, my own place, I do whatever I feel like, and I make fantasies come true like God so pull yourself together, and leave me alone, OK? Kid, wake up. Wake up, you can look after her. You gotta look after my kid while I go to work. Where are you going? I'm going to work, and she stays. I'm on "speed”, I'm gonna work for 5 days straight now. So look after her. Tell Menni I promise I'll come get her, OK? I don't know the first thing about babies There's nothing to know! Give her a bottle if she's hungry, If she's tired, change her, and if she smells, change her. See ya! What do you aspire to? I don't know what you mean. We all have aspirations, some want to become soccer players. Others aspire to find themselves a nice sugar daddy. Everybody has aspirations. What are your aspirations? I aspire to silence. - Do you live a noisy life? - Yes, I do. Lior, please wipe the cum off my ass. - Don't you like my sperm? - I don't like being dirty. I always keep clean, and I always use rubber. That's important for a whore. Thanks. Don't mention it. To each his own aspirations. Shlomo, before you say anything: I'm not working, I'm sick. No, I'm in a crappy mood, you don't wanna see me today. Well, if you insist, it's gonna cost you double. I'll be there in ten. Ditched her. I love you. I didn't mean to say that... Sorry. I didn't mean to. I didn't mean to say that, it's just nice to pretend. - You leaving? - Yes. - I thought you'd spend the night. - I'm sorry, I'm going home. Don't you want me to read your tarot cards? No. Don't you wanna know your own future? I know my future, Shlomo, and it won't last for long. I made some pasta. Shall I warm it up for you? No, thanks, Shlomo, I'm tired, I'm not feeling well, OK? - You could stay the night. - You know I always prefer not to. Do you want me to walk you? No, it's fine, I'll manage. Shlomo, you promised double rate over the phone.. There's an extra 200 here, could be yours if you spend the night. I just wanna go home. Tell him I'm not taking it up the ass. She won't take it up the ass. - How much does she want? - How much? 100, 200? If you want it up the ass, go find a guy for 200! Huh?! What's with her? You're lucky he didn't understand that. Give him a Russian girl, you have loads of them. He wants an Israeli girl, so cut the bull. Take him, or you're down 500. - Where would I get you 500? - Overtime. Get! You know what I really wanted to be when I'm older? I wanted to be a singer. I'm always happy when I sing. I adore cooking, too. My folks were never around, so I learned how to cook quick-lunches early on. Whenever I'd get bored, I'd open a cook book and start cooking. I would eat with Rita, our live-in from the Ivory Coast. She's real nice. There's no work there, so she came here. She's been with us for five years. Want me to sing for you? They say that kids who were sung to from an early age, they get highly developed artistic capabilities. If we give you music to listen to, It'll boost up your creativity. Right, a song that'd fit your age group: So? Do I sing nice? You have some music? Did you say something? Music, something in the background? Does this look like a dance club? Sorry. You didn't answer my question. Look at me when I'm talking to you! Can you answer my question? The place doesn't look like a discotheque. If you cross me one more time... - We have a client. - Uncuff me! Can I trust you not to run for it? Lior, please, Uncuff me! A man's word? I swear, just don't let him see me like this! I believe you, but the client asked that you be cuffed, turns him on. Lior, please, don't do this to me. He also doesn't want you to see him. Relax! There's no point in fighting. There's no point in fighting. I can offer you one consolation: You're gonna get fucked by a celebrity. - Is the kid there? - Yeah. How does he look? You'll see. I prepped him for ya. Benjamin (Benny) Landau, Minister of Public Security Oh, dear... Is everything alright, Menni? Is everything alright? You're lucky you didn't find him. Boyfriends mean trouble. Look at how I look after the hell I've been through. You never told me you had a boyfriend! Sometimes silence is golden. Stories like these are only good for serious emergencies. This isn't an emergency, is it? You know I don't believe in love, so how come I'm in love with him? Look at it as divine intervention. Maybe you weren't meant to be. And that's the good case scenario. Maybe he's with a trick, maybe he's wounded. Anything's possible. Just don't feel hurt, - most girls got a short memory. - Yeah, I know. Let me show you something. Didn't I ever show you my photo album? I'll show you. This is my favorite, from when I was a little girl. Here. Look how pretty I was. Adorable, no? I like the ones of me as a baby the best. This is me in "Tom Sawyer”. Did your folks take you to watch that play? The only time I went to the theater, was when a trick asked me to come see his play. I think I'm bleeding. I said I think I'm bleeding. Can you Uncuff me? - Will you try to run away? - No, I won't. Fine. You're a dead man if you try anything. If you hurt me, no one would wanna fuck me. - Huh? - Yeah. You can't damage your goods. Folks don't like bleeding orifices. Sex is a good thing, huh? Not when your ass is torn open. Better get used to it. My clientèle loves to tear open kids like you. Makes them cum hard. You realize I'm a human being? You're a whore. You remember that, you're my whore. - Didn't that do? - No, I'm bleeding bad. Out. I'm not done educating you. Tell me, how could a cop do that sort of stuff? You're supposed to help folks like me, get us out of our mess, not drive us in deeper. You mouthing off again?! Why won't you answer? What are you afraid of? Lie down on you back. Answer my question, so I know you're still human. Because you're a piece of shit, and before the dope kills you, I can pimp you for a buck or two. No one cares about you one way or the other. I care about me! I care! You've been working hard tonight, haven't you. Yeah. Do you want to tell me about it? No. I'm off to bed. It's late. You've been working real hard. There are naive, innocent kids out there. - You be nice to them, OK? - OK. - Good night. - Good night. Eran, wake up! I just fell asleep, what do you want? When did she bring her? The little darling? A couple of hours ago. - Was it OK? - Yeah, it went OK. She doesn't talk, but I sang for her. Did she say where she was going? No, she was high on Adams, said she was going to work somewhere and she left her here. Right, I know where she went, want to come with me? What about her? We'll take her with. Menni! Did you see Tal? Nope, he wasn't there and then I went to work, so... Shame. He never talked about anyone the way he talked about you. Sometimes we forget what we do for a living, the world we're in. You don't believe he cares for you? Why are you doing this? We're not entitled to love? What are we, subhuman? We'll look for him later, after we find Mika. - What are you doing here? - Huh? What are you doing here? - I fell asleep... - You sleeping here? I'm waiting for a friend of mine. Does this look like a hotel? Can't you sleep somewhere else? - Yes. - Beat it, or I'll call the cops. - Do you want me to call them? - No, no need to. - You sure it's here? - Wouldn't be the first time. I don't follow. When she's on Adam, she usually winds up here. So what's your plan? The plan is I go in, and take her with me. Isn't it dangerous? Don't they have guns? No, the last thing they want are guns going off. But isn't there someone you can call for help? This isn't the first time, it'll be alright. You again? - Is she here? - She's working. Can I wait for her? You can wait out here. If she says yes, can I take her home? She won't say yes. Can I try? Try, she'll say no. Saw her eyes, she's over the top. Find another girl. Get out of here. - I want you to come with me. - And I want you to get out of here. Mika... Mika, I'll stop hooking too. We could live together, as a family. - Are you lying to me? - No. But you are! How could we live as a family?! Do you see yourself as a dad? I promise I'll try You don't love me, you don't even love your daughter, you can't. Did you ever call that baby, that daughter of yours, by her name? I want you to get out of here. Mika, don't do this. He's letting you go, you're not making him enough money. - Fuck it. - Do you listen to yourself?! - Is this where you want to end up? - I want you to get out of here. I want you out and never come back, never see you again, understand? Are you sure? Get out. They're not letting you take her away? - She won't leave there. - I don't follow you. She won't leave, she'd rather die. What about her baby? We'll take her to her grandparents. Good morning. - Are you going to tell them where she is? - Yes. You think they could help her? Dunno. They need professional help only they're ashamed to admit it. My folks live right around here. Why don't you move back in for a while? Oh, they don't want me. They want someone else, not me. You can crash at my place, maybe we could help each other. You mean that? Yeah. Thanks. Can I say goodbye to her? You know, you never told me her name. Funny. - It's Tal. - Tal? Yeah. Mika gave it to her. Her name's Tal. - Ruti... - What are you doing here so late? I came to bring her over. I need to talk to you. I can't take care of her. I have enough trouble. Ruti, Mika's back at the whorehouse. Maybe it's better this way. Better for all of us if she stays. What am I gonna do with her, though? I don't know. I can't even bear to look at this baby. She reminds me too much of her. You know what, I think it might be better if you take her to a social worker, they'll take care of her. - Would you like some fruit? - No, thanks, we're not hungry. So, keep in touch, tell me what's going on? Fine. Come on, I have an idea. - Where to? - It's a surprise. Have you ever watched the sunrise before? Never have. Watch, it's just starting now. Just watch how beautiful it is.
