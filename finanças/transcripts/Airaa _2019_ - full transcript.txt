Tell me about yourself Mr Adi, this is a misunderstanding I'm not interested in marriage My parents arranged this meeting by mistake Works perfect for me I don't buy into marriage and monogamy We only live once. And youth? Just 15 or 20 years Let's just get married We don't have to live with each other No pressure. What do you say? Look Mr Adi, thanks for the offer True, I'm not interested in marriage But an arrangement like this? No! I saw your Facebook photos Office mates, boys, office party You can do whatever you're doing now, after marriage as well What do you say? You're leaving? Aren't you in the Media? I'm sure you must have had to sleep around to be in this position Why are you over- reacting? You want to get married and then sleep around And if I refuse? You shame me for it Women who want to support their family are crippled by men like you! I think your parents' retirement pension was wasted on your abroad education They should've spent that on rearing 15 pigs instead! I have another qualm with them Why they named you Adi instead of shoddy Stupid "Are you made of your desires or are you in disguise?" "Or the physical embodiment or a delusion?" "Are you made of your happiness or sorrow?" "Or the sum of your thoughts?" "Questions are many Your life is the answer" "Your life is the extension of the seeds you sowed" "Oh girl! Oh dear girl!" "Where are you going leaving your traces?" "Oh girl! Oh dear girl!" "Will you see who is driving you?" "Who is she? Who is the other girl? Or both different?" "Where are you going?" "Search is on Even after death" "It is time to wake up" "When the eyes open You will appear" "My shadow trails you Where are you off to?" "None asked for your desire None supported you" "None wiped your tears Answer me, oh girl!" "Youâ€™re seeking your destiny Oh girl!" "Youâ€™re seeking your destiny Oh girl!" "Your body, my soul, your sorrow, my happiness" "It is time for us to mingle Come to join" "Oh girl! Oh dear girl!" "Where are you going leaving your traces?" "Oh girl! Oh dear girl!" "Will you see who is driving you?" 'White Elephant' I've been married for five years Okay? We have two kids. Okay... But he has never kissed me so far What! Which one, sir? - Okay - Okay sir See if you can use this on the cover Let's not delay this. Mail it soon, okay? What's with the fierce walk? I feel like I've lived a lifetime answering all these questions I'm really tired, sir Inspite of your disinterest, you are doing a great job Accept it You have a fandom of people eagerly waiting to read your answers Your fans You think? They read my answers, go home and still fight with their wives Why don't we start a YouTube channel for our newspaper? Daily news, live reports, movie reviews... We could even do a video version of this advice column Our viewership will increase, we can go across the globe! We could earn too! People's mail 2.0. How's that? YouTube? This isn't time pass Let's not get into the internet farce and spoil our reputation YouTube isn't cheap like you think - Even BBC... - Stop it Yamuna!

Bhavani has killed eight people already Including three from her own family Do you know Bhavani? You've harmed her in some way What nonsense? I've never met her before. I have no idea how she looks! Why should I harm her? It might not have been intentional Think about it Mohit Agarwal - business man Arivu - Head constable Francis - Lorry driver Gothu, shorty They have nothing in common She has also killed her mom, sister and brother-in-law I know why she killed her family Initially, I couldn't believe that Bhavani did all this I have never seen her raise so much as her voice The world crushed a feather like her under its cruel feet! Whenever a life is born, people should celebrate Which baby she begot? But my Bhavani was born with a curse It's a girl again - Girl again! - What can you do? - Don't fret - He really wanted a son! He's going to suffer with three girls God needs to show him a way Marimuthu! Mari... They branded her unlucky for no mistake of hers Mari died by a lightning strike!

Is that enough? Look at that beauty! It's the last day of school and you're not a woman yet! When is that likely to happen? We'll put up a hoarding if that happens. Okay? Are you even sure you're a girl? Good question A guy's touch can transform you Her own friends ragged her Everytime she wept... I felt ashamed that I couldn't help her That anger, transformed into love Bhavani, hold on Bhavani Please stop crying Don't mind them You'll hit puberty when your body is ready Didn't we learn this in Biology? Listen to me, please don't cry I like you a lot! The family that did not celebrate her birth... ...celebrated her puberty like it's an achievement of hers! Keep quite Oh God!

The red one will look very pretty on you The red one looks very pretty on you! Unlucky girl, born at the wrong time! Bled at the wrong time! Were you born to destroy our lives? Get out! I don't want to see your face Sister's baby is mentally challenged Everyone thinks it's your luck that brought it Whatever went wrong in her family, it was blamed on her Everytime she cried, I was there to wipe her tears Her smile was the light in my life I was the light in hers Hold me, Amudha!

I left her like a coward, scared of my father Amudhan! I met Bhavani after a long time, by chance I still don't understand why she's after you To decipher that, I think you should meet someone I know Call me if you need anything. I'll help you Go You're not the first victim, you're the ninth! She's killed eight people so far I still don't understand why she's after you I think you need to talk to Bhavani You've harmed her in some way! You should meet someone I know Yamuna Where were you?

Pain in the ass Hey, call the ambulance The day I was to marry Amudhan and start a new life... ...ended in my funeral! That's because of... ...the selfishness, the lack of empathy... ...avarice, greed, lust... ...hatred towards others who are unlike us! That little mistake of yours... ...a mistake you did out of selfishness... ...has destroyed my life, Yamuna! Madam! Please hold the lift I wonder why I'm always cornered What do you want? What do you want me to do? It's you, that I want! I want to re-live my life through you! I didn't have a good life when I was alive... ...I want it now! You have to sacrifice yourself for that! If that was your aim, you could have taken me before I could have. But I wanted your wholehearted consent Then, why did you torment me? Shouldn't you experience a little bit of... ...the suffering that I went through? You should know! You will understand my pain only then! You'll know my demand is not unfair! Hello. yes Amudhan, no... Stop it What's all this? Flowers, decoration. Your Bhavani is coming back to you Through me This is wrong. You can't change fate If I can change her fate, why shouldn't I? What a life... ...one man gets it all... ...the other gets none at all! Why is God not aware of this? He created us all And then? Did he doze off? What God couldn't give her, I have a chance to give What started with me, shall end with me Bhavani... Please make it to our wedding Didn't I tell you... ...that I'll come back for you! I'm finally getting to live my dream I wanted the whole world to see us wed But, that's alright Let's have a beautiful wedding with just you and me But, something's missing. Here you go The whole world is envious of my Amudhan It's time... Let's get married! This is wrong What is? Destroying a girl's life to start our own. This is wrong! Wait Don't walk away when we see some light in our life I did all this for you I didn't ask you to Stop! What are you doing? She agreed to this Come with me Leave me When we were in school... ...I used to admire you through the window That's the beauty I want She would intend harm to no one I don't want this Bhavani Yamuna's got it all Parents, family, happiness, education, everything! I asked for her body. What's wrong with that? Who are you to decide what's right and what's wrong? Six strangers have rewritten my fate Isn't that wrong? She is one among them! No matter what... ...I can't do this When I look at you... ...I don't see my old Bhavani in you I can see Yamuna lurking underneath I can't justify this, accept it and lead a life with you You still won't agree? Fine, she doesn't deserve the life that we can't get! No, leave her She's innocent! Am I not? If you don't agree, she dies right now! This is not about her life I loved you and I dreamt of a life with you Now here you are, in someone else's body! How can I accept that? I will be betraying our love I'm sorry... Why did you have to kill yourself? From now, we're going to live together!
