We're so glad you could make it. You said it was an emergency. You know I mean business. That's why I came as soon as possible. Look, I assume it's about your money right? Those three punks took off with it. We caught the first one, and he's already been turned into ashes. We will find the two others soon. -No, no no no.... That's not what it's about. What's the big concern then? We were told that you're an informer for the police. Man, Ridiculous! How long have we been doing business together? If I was an informer, you would have gone down a long time ago. I have a sniper on you right now. All I have to do is to raise my right hand and you're gone. Okay, What do you expect from me right now? Someone is here to prove that you're an informant for the police. What's so funny? I don't see joke here. Are you serious? This prick... That's Tyron, the second kid that ran away with your money. All we got to do now is find the third one. This is bullshit..... Tell, tell him what you said to me about informant. Huh... Well... ... he's not directly,... ...I mean he is a cop.... .... he's connected with cops. But... I mean... ...that's not what you told me before. You're making me waste my time. Get him out of here. Hey man, In this business don't we all have cops on our payroll? Alright. Now you find the third one. Then, I will see my money back right? Right. Good. We're already on it. Come I was told you wanted to talk to me. Give me your badge and your gun. How do you feel right now? Disappointed. -No wrong answer. You feel like nobody right now without this badge and without this gun You walk out of my building. without these, and you become a civilian All the fights with your fellow officers become senseless. I gave you a warning.... but you ignored it. Just yesterday... ....you had another beef. Adjust, That's all you have to do. Sir, there are things going on that are against my principles That's not what I went to the academy for. Like what? Bogart, give us a minute. I am listening. Too many reports don't match what actually happens in the field,... ...for some reason. It gets to me. I mean, why is it happening? That's it. Detective, we don't live in a perfect world. That said, I will personally look in to the matter. The police force needs man like you. I need you. You're family to me. Be one of us. Now take your badge and gun, and get the heck out of my office. Yo, go after him this way we'll go around the corner. Damn it! He got away. Let's get out of here. Let's go, come. I wanted to shoot him man but he was too far. I think I know where he might be heading. -Shut up. Next time, I will take care of it myself. Let's go. Okay... You're all set. Is there anything else? No. I am all set, thank you. Have a nice day. Alright. You too, You have a good day. -Thank you. It's 4:55. We close in 5 minutes boss. Oh, yep hum... ...It's about that time. I'm gonna go... ...close the front door and guard it. We don't want a repeat like yesterday, right? No more please. I wasn't here yesterday what happened? We had to stay 30 minutes extra because 6 customers walked in right at closing time. I've seen that before, not a big deal. That's what you say.. I got things to do, honey. I have to pick up my son from the day care 30 minutes after we close here. Otherwise I get charge another $100.00 Just for late penalty. Me too. I got things to do. Hi, hello wait. Can I please check my mail box.? We're closed. Sorry. Very quick please, It's very urgent. Just be quick alright. It's gotta be fast. Thank you so much you are so kind. -Yeah no problem. See, I was quick. I was waiting for that check. Thank you very much. No problem, Have a good night. -You have a good one. Alright. be quiet. shuuu. I think he's gone. Oh my God. Oh yeah, the circus continues outside. Fire trucks, ambulances, police cars,... ...yet another shooting in the hood. I wonder when it's gonna stop. It's gonna be all right. I'm sorry. I gotta go now. I'm sorry. You know my situation I gotta run but if you need me to stay I will. You don't need to pay an extra $100 for your son's day care Go Veronica. Everything is gonna be fine. Everything that is going on is outside on the street. The front door is lock. We're close anyway. Just go, that's fine. Are you sure you can close everything out by yourself? I'm fine just go. I'll be fine. I'm the post office manager.... I can handle it. Don't make this face okay I can handle it. Please go. Everything is gonna be okay alright. Tomorrow, another day, a better day. Keep that in mind. Life goes on. That's for sure. -bye, okay. Go home alright. Come on. I know you want to silence me. But you can't touch me. Get out of here! Get out! That's bullet proof glass to protect us from thugs like you! Yeah, take a good look at me. I got a message for you. Wow, The guys is a pro.... We checked the security cameras, but he never looked up once to show his face. Professional enough to get pass two dozens officer's without being noticed. We wouldn't want that to get out. I have a picture of him... ...That I took from behind the glass May I ? Yep, this is our guy. -Let me see. I'd like to have this process. We have a mobile lab outside.... ...It take five to ten minutes. Bogart. Have this photo processed. Detective Williams. Yes sir. Talia, it took courage to do what you did. I appreciate that. Having a photo ID, over guarantee We will find him and soon. Talia we will find him and we will protect you that's what we do. This is detective Henry Williams. He will be handling this case. Detective Williams if you would. Drive Talia home... ...Bogart has her phone in the lab. After you've dropped her off meet me at the station. Listen up everybody. It seems we have a positive photo ID of the suspect so,... ...Let's find this thug today. You'll be in good hands You'll be fine. Hey, Thanks. Hey, ...who's this fellow that just came from behind the caution line? I don't know, that's nobody. Never mind he's gone. I am sorry for what happened. It's disgusting,... ...in this city there are way too many killers out there who haven't get caught yet. You need to denounce them. They need to be behind bars. Denounce? Oh no, It doesn't work like that. You have to identify them first. It's quite a long process before getting them back behind bars. What are you waiting for then? Start the process. Look, I understand what you just experienced is a traumatic. I am sorry. I'm just glad that you weren't harmed in the crime, and... Please, just drive me home. I don't need a long sympathetic speech right now. I'm just doing my job Talia okay,... ...Protection. Protection Ah, Do you use protection? Excuse me? Never mind. That was just out of line. It's all right,... I guess after a night like this, it's okay to have room for a little joke. Right? I think we need to start this whole thing over. Hi, What's your name again? Henry.... Nice meeting you, my name is Talia. Guess what?... ...I have no room for jokes right now. My life.... ...was almost brutally ended because I saw a killer's face. Out of all the people in the world, you have the honor of driving me home. I would appreciate it if we do this quietly. - What the heck are you doing? I notice that car right there is following us. - What the heck are you doing? Don't worry we'll get them, they're running. Stop, what are you doing?. Just take me home... Right now, I don't wanna be part of your police adventure. Are you trying to show off or Something? Just take me home now. I am just doing my job, Talia. He opens the car door for me to get out. What is this, a date? I am just doing my job, Talia. -Henry! What? Talia, are you up? Talia! Who was that on the phone mama? Oh, you are awake, good. Do you have something to tell me? Why are you asking me that? That was the police on the phone... They got a suspect. They're gonna be arraigned him this morning at the Boston District Court.... ...and they need you there to identify him. What the heck is going on? I can't believe they just... Look mama, I am sorry there was an incident at the post office yesterday. I took a picture of this guy who was out of line and I gave it to the police... I guess they must have found him. Talia, are you lying to me? If you gave them the picture, why would they want you there? I find it strange. The way you behaved last night after you got home - I knew something was wrong. Why didn't you mentioned anything about that? I know how you are, you would blow things way out of proportion. I didn't want you to get upset over it. Your blood pressure would have gotten high over nothing. Really. Nothing? Are you kidding me? The police are calling my place early in the morning to request your presence. I want to be like you mama. A strong woman I will go help them out in their investigation Ok. Nothing to worry about. When did all this incident happen? Yesterday afternoon. Yesterday? Don't you think it's a little too early for this identification process? I don't know. I guess, it's a good they caught him. It means that it's over. Let me get ready to go. -Honey, honey. Well you know, people are always afraid to testify to the police or in court. There's nothing worse than being a rat. Snitching is a sin in this neighborhood, you know. -I know I don't care, I just want to do my part move on. All right if this is what you want, it's ok. But let me tell you.... I always said to myself, if I were to witness something bad in the neighborhood, I would, probably want to report it. if given a chance. I think I should go with you. Oh no no no, mama, please. I don't need you to come with me. I got this. All right if this is what you want, it's ok. Anyway, they said they are sending someone to pick you up to take you to the courthouse. Hello Jenny, -Good morning. Good morning Lieutenant Baker. -Good morning Jenny. These two agents from Internal Affairs have been waiting for you. Lieutenant Baker, officer Preston Cole, this is officer Mauricia Belleville. How do you do sir? -Hello. We're here to talk to you about an open investigation into an urgent matter. No heads up, no warning. It must be urgent. Follow me. It doesn't ring any bell. Ricky Vella, notorious drug dealer, is in operation right here. And I don't know about it. We are opening an investigation concerning some of your officers, who are potentially his associates. Therefore, we need your cooperation. I found it strange, even offensive. May I ask which officers you're investigating? All your undercover officers sir. They all report directly to me. We're aware of that sir. You're investigating me as well then? Yes, we're screening you sir. There have been too many drug related murders that remain unsolved in your jurisdiction. It's been happening under your watch sir. What we need is access to all your daily reports... ... activities on paper files, and electronically. Then we will conduct a series of interviews with your officers. I don't like this. I've been on the force for 35 years. I'm not about to let some bad cop or cops tarnish my reputation. I will be the first to oust any cop involve in criminal activity period. Hi, thank you driver. Hi shorty. My name is TJ. What's your name? Come on girl. You see, I'm just smiling at you. That's positive energy right there yo. All you got to do is return the favor... ...with a tiny smile, then positive energy gets multiplied. Then we all feel a little bit of happiness. Right? See. That's what I'm talking about right there. I mean, It's a beautiful day,... ...the sun is rising. Hey thanks for smiling. After all, life can be short. I mean any passing day we get to enjoy is a good reason to feel all right. So where are you heading? To town for a meeting. Oh, is that right? You're very beautiful you know that? You remind me of a cute angel. Thank you. No, you don't need to thank me. I mean.... ...If you are a real angel... ...you would share Happiness, not a possible death sentence. Yeah, Three lives for one. Does it make sense to you? Yeah, That's right, you know what I'm talking about, right? I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, that's right, keep talking. One young roach fell to the ground yesterday. You saw it, That's one life. On the other end of the spectrum, the trigger man is one,... ...and your life is two. Your loved ones add up to three, maybe even four. We don't want to go there. That doesn't add up pleasantly, does it? I'm an angel as well. I bring you a message. I may be an angel of death. Do yourself a favor:.... Go back home. That's the message. What? What is it? It's the hood. We burn rats, feel me? No one here gonna say nothin'. Did I say something people? Huh, did I say something? You see, get off the bed.... ...and wake up from your dream. Go home. We'll take a little ride. -Alright. How you doing? -Got it. What the heck is wrong with you? Do you know me? I can't believe it. This guy has some nerve to touch me. I didn't touch you bitch! She's lying. Ma'am where did he touch you? What's going on here? -Do you know him? No, I don't know him! Keep him away from me. Do you wanna press charges ma'am? I am telling you, she's lying man. Anyone here can tell you that. Right people? Wrong, no one sees anything! Remember, this is the hood. This is my stop right here. Just keep him away, I'm getting off, keep him away officer. keep him away officer. We will don't worry. Thank you. That bitch is crazy man. It's all over, okay. Call it a day. Yeah I am calling it a day, next stop is mine anyway. You're not gonna go after her are you? I know where I'm going man. Take it easy dog. Don't call me dog! I'm not your dog -Whatever man. Yo, you see where she went? I thought she was in the bus with you. -Damn! You see, I told you I saw somebody pass by who looks like her. Well, I didn't see her. -Yo come on, let me drive. Hello mom, Talia, where are you? I'm on my way to the courthouse. is everything okay? I am worried. Look, Henry came by to pick you up.... ...When I told him you were gone he became so worried... ...Then I became concerned. Why didn't you wait for him to drive you there? It's a long story that I didn't want to bother you with. I'll tell you later. Talia! What the heck you do you want, Henry? I'm just doing my job, okay? Protecting you. Things don't add up right. Normally it's supposed to be a line up of potential suspects at the police station. Or some picture profiles for you to go through. Guess what, I don't need your protection. I know what you're doing and I wanna get out of this situation on my own. The call for you to go the courthouse is out of the ordinary. I know it's complicated. Just tell me where you are and I'll come get you, Then, I will explain to you what I think is going on. Hello, hello. Oh no. A young lady Talia is calling for you. She says it's important, a matter of life and death. What? Put her through. lieutenant Baker. Yeah, It's Talia Smith. Last night you said you would do everything you could to guarantee my safety.... ...So far, you've totally failed. Why are you saying that? I want you to live up to your responsibilities! I hope this conversation is being recorded for the record. Now, I have people harassing me. They don't want me to go to he courthouse, and I think they're ready to kill me. My life is in your hands. I sent detective Williams to escort you to the courthouse. Is he with you? No, I didn't want to wait for him. I decided to go there on my own. -What? Talia, you've got to trust us. I did it exactly because I don't trust him, and I don't trust you, any of you. I don't want to live in fear expecting to face that killer on the street again. I just wanna go to the a courthouse and be done once and for all. I don't care what you want call it: rat, snitch, sin, traitor, I don't Care. Just get me to the courtroom, chief. That's your job. Isn't it? Last night..... ...Henry returned my phone to me after I trusted you and gave it to you. The picture I took was deleted from my cell phone. Why? I don't know anything about that. Talia for now, just tell me where you are, and I will make sure you get there safely, Okay? Let's go miss, it's getting late. I'm gonna get some coffee ma'am, do you want some? Excuse me? -Is that a problem? really. While picking me up earlier didn't you say it's getting late? Yes, but I will be quick. This is unbelievable. [Car pull up violently. Open the door, quick. Open the door. What's going on Bogart? Who's behind this? You tell me! -What's wrong with you? Hey talk, talk Bogart. -I don't know man. Talk before I blow your brain out Bogart. -I don't know man, alright. You don't know, you don't know. -I pick her up man and this happen. Speak before it's too late come on man. -Put the gun down, take it easy. Okay I'll put it down. All right we'll be there in like 10 minutes. Pull over. Why? It doesn't make sense, three lives for one. Please pull over. What are you talking about? Pull over now. What is it now? Why risk three more lives for one person? Hey, don't fall for that don't snitch stuff! Alright, you're just setting an example. In the future, that could save dozens of Lives. It's not about risking three lives. It's about saving many more lives. Try to see the big picture Talia. Whoever is behind all this, just tried to kill me My life is precious. Your life is precious? All life is precious. Including the one I told you to keep. That's right. It's supposed to be you, me and a baby.... Three lives against one world out there. But no, you weren't ready yet. I knew.... ...you were looking for an opportunity to bring that up. Trying to act all professional, Oh I am just doing my job. As soon as you showed up to be the Protector, I knew what was coming. First thing you said to me when I saw you was.... Too many killers out there haven't been caught yet. You were just looking for another way... ...to hurt me again with your words. But reminder..... ...my body, my choice okay. Yeah, Your choice huh... Your choice alright to waste a life. Look. I am sorry. All I ever wanted is a family, Talia. To be with you forever. Is that a crime? I understand now you weren't ready. I don't wanna hold it against you but,... What just came out of me was my anger, my frustration, my pain. But I still love you. Huh, I know. Don't spoil this Henry,... ...you just saved my life. Yeah, I would save you over and over again if I had too. Come on hey. It wasn't easy for me. I know, I know, I know. After what happened between us,... ...this twist of fate ties us together again for some reason. What are the odds? Out of all the people out there,... ...life brought us back together to face this situation. Our paths crossed for a reason, maybe fate. Look,... Let's do the right thing. You have my support I'm on your side... ...more than ever before. Where is Bogart? He didn't tell you what happen? There's something I need to know. You heard nothing about an explosion by a coffee shop? Oh we heard about it, and sent a response team out there earlier. What? Look, the media doesn't know about her yet. Let's move on before we get mobbed But you! Internal Affair is investigating you. For execution of general duty and for your handling of this case. It's a problem. Its very serious. Are you saying that you want to remove me from this case? I'm saying we'll talk later. Dallas keep me posted. Hey Talia, They don't allow cell phones inside the courthouse. Let me have your cell phone, I will lock it in my car. I will step away for a moment to comeback later. I have an idea what's going on here. In a short while I'll back. You're not gonna leave me with these animals? Talia, It's the safest place for you right now. Those thugs operate in the dark, but it's so bright here. All eyes here are wide open. There is nothing they can do to you in such a public place, trust me. Hey, Officer Dallas do me a favor... I am going to step away for a minute please take good care of her. No problem, be my pleasure. She will be in good company. Good thanks, alright. Hello Liz, Hey, where is Talia man? This is Henry. Talia is inside the courtroom now. I will tell her later that you called. Hey yo just put Talia on the phone. Sorry I can't do that. They don't allow cell phones inside the courthouse. Who's this? Hey yo this is an angel of death. Get her this message then. three lives for one is it worth it? Look, tell Talia... ...get her ass back home and call her mother's phone once she get there. A message from her daddy. Okay, I will deliver the message but.. Hello, hello... I am glad you made it, but who asked you to be here today? They called my home this morning from the police station. I guess they asked me to be here. Well, they talked to my mother not me. I see, I don't think the judge will get to the identification procedure in this session. We'll wait and see either way. We'll get this guy behind bars for good. Okay, his record is a mile long. Really, How do you know about his record? We have access to the criminal files, His file expend for about 30 years But he is so young. They are bringing him in now. How many are they bringing in? Only him, he is the only suspect. But this guy... What? Nothing. I know how difficult that could be. It's hard for everybody to do. You're doing the right thing. When the time comes. You'll know, you'll be doing the right thing. Okay. Listen, I just want to get out of here and go home. Be patient. You're already here. The arraignment is not going to take long. It's not going to take that long. After they'll set the dates for his trial.... That's when you will need to come to testify and identify the suspect. Only if you have to. Alright then. All rise. This court is now in session. Please be seated. This is the arraignment of the suspect Ryan Anglewood... ...for the murder of Pedro Santos that occurred yesterday, July 29, 2016... ...at the corner of Washington Street and Berkeley street. Thank you mister clerk. I can't do this. I am sorry, this is not for me. I want to withdraw from testifying in this case. The court remain in session please. Be quiet. I've been doing this work a long time. I understand how difficult it is. I really do. What I don't understand is why you came in on a day when you didn't have to. and then changed your mind. You walked out as the session started. Are you afraid? Because If that's what it is, we can guarantee your safety. I don't want anything to do with this. Your community needs witnesses like you to come forward... That's the only way we're gonna stop the violence that's destroying it. So, identifying that guy in there as the killer is helping the Community? What are you trying to say? Are you saying that the suspect we have in custody.... ...is not the person you saw at the post office? Hey, what happen to your face? - A small car accident. Please, take your conversation somewhere else. Listen miss, I know you've been through a lot. Based on the information from our sources and that photo from your phone,... ...Which I haven't seen myself.... ...but it matches up with this guys profile. Everything we have all the records indicate that he is the killer.... All you've gotta do is to identify him before the court in the near future. I am confused about your attitude. If you saw someone else, we need to know about it right now. We represent the law. but, we need to work together to bring justice to whomever deserves it. Right? We need your help. and you need to learn to trust us. I just want to go home now. That's your right ma'am. Maybe we can get a subpoena later to force her to testify. Would that be necessary? - I believe so. All right, you can go home. I will have one of my men to drive you home. Hey Bogart,... would you take the lady home? No, no no It won't be necessary. I'm taking her home. I don't think so. Lieutenant Clark Baker want to see you in the office. Right now! I want officer Henry to take me home. Don't worry officer Dallas, I will go see him after I drop her off. Here is your phone back. - Where did you go? I went to see some friends who are part of the police network to figure out what the heck is going on. What did you find out? - It's complicated. There's a secret hand here, and I am on track to solving the mystery. I know it's looks like a date. But it's business - actually, both. They didn't expect me at the courthouse. They didn't know what to do with me. I do find that strange... That why I was so disappointed when you left before I picked you up this morning. The call for you to go to the court smelled like a can of warms. Whoever is behind all this.... ...wanted me out of the house and to know exactly where I would be. And then, they sent you,... ....It means you're in danger as well. Don't worry about it, I have my eyes wide open. Henry! This is very serious. They didn't expect me to be testifying today. I know. Like you said, I am a target as well. I spoke up about things I witnessed at the police force and.... ...they hate me for that. I wonder about the timing and why I was selected to escort you. Scary! They brought a stranger into the courtroom.... ...Are they really expect me to identify him as the killer? I know, it's just a shame. I'm sorry some of my fellow officers are so crooked. Yeah, like that low life you beat up earlier by the coffee shop. Someone asked him what happened to his face. He lied right there and claimed he had a car accident. Unbelievable. Yeah, Bogart. I will get him. Listen Talia, I have bad news. What is it? Well huh, you're phone rang earlier... I picked it up because I noticed it's your mom. And hum,... What is it please tell me? Some people abducted her. They're holding her hostage... What? ...and asked me to tell you to go back home. Three lives for one is it worth it? Oh my God no, not my mother. What did they want? They didn't want you to go testify. They wanted you to go back home and call them from your land line. Why didn't you drop everything and come get me right away? Who ever tried to kill you didn't want you to get there for some reason. I thought it was the right thing to do since you were already there. Henry this is my mother for Christ sake. What are you talking about? I tell you what, okay. Let's head there now alright. Get down, get down. Oh my God, oh my God. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. I get it. That was their original plan for earlier. We gotta keep going okay. Okay let's keep going. This is my mother, Oh my God. Hi Mom, -Hello, Talia... Where are you? I'm at the Neponset River Reservation. Okay let's get going. We'll come get you right away. What happened? Hello. What's up coz? Ha ha ha. What's up man? Where are you? I'm at the palace man You should come over. It's finished. What is? The concern. Oh yeah, what happened? You know I'm connected man. Yo, meet me later, same location. Yo say the word man, I'll have this old lady stinking. Naah man, let her go. Let her go Alright, If you say so big dog. Alright. Yo let's go. We're moving out. It's over. Oh for real? Yeah for real! What the fuck you mean man? Yo it's over guys, let's move it. No, tell me we're gonna bruise her up a little bit. Naah, leave the old lady alone man. Hey mom, -Oh you're here. I'm here mom. -Oh that was terrible. Oh my God what happened? They just received a phone call, then they disappeared. Oh my God this was terrible. They just walked away and left you there. Huh, yes. It's alright, we are here now at home. We're home. I'm so sorry about all this. I witnessed a murder. I didn't know it would become so complicated. I should have just told you. It's okay, you were trying to protect me from this nightmare and.... ...At times I didn't think this nightmare would be over so soon. But it is almost over. Let's go to my sisters in Rhode Island. Get me out of here. I'm sorry for the trouble Liz. I can open an investigation to find them. Its okay, I survived. We should move out of this neighborhood. New developments now on our top story... ...police have charged career criminal Ryan Anglewood... ...in yesterday braze and day light murder Just outside the local post office... ...Authorities say it was Anglewood That gun down Pedro Santos.... ...Just before five pm Anglewood was arraigned in district court today.... ...and is being held without bell until his pre-trial hearing next month. We'll have the latest on this breaking story, as updates become available. What do you mean by it's almost over? Whoever is behind all this knows they're charging the wrong person, So they're comfortable with it. They have no immediate reason to come after you anymore. But for the law enforcement system... ...it's not over, You and I know that's not the real killer who's been charged. The real killer is still out there. If he's still out there, how can it be over for me? How can it be safe? He doesn't have a strong reason to come after you. You said it right: a strong reason, but he still does have a reason. He knows that I know what he looks like. Well then, he must know by now.... If he tries to come near you, I'll destroy him. I appreciate that but.... ...that's not enough to keep him from chasing me to erase the evidence. You know something? I am determined to live my life without fear. Let's say it's behind me. -Talia, Talia.... You have my full support. Okay. Have you met Ricky Vella in person? No, I have not. I have never even heard his name before,... ...though his picture looks familiar. But then again.... I've seen hundreds of suspects' pictures. We always need a lot more information ... ...to find out who they are. You've been under investigation... ...in three different cases for abuse of power. The latest one involves a car explosion. That vehicle is unknown to the police How did that happen? I was ordered to escort the witness On my way there I stopped to get some coffee. I heard the explosion and I ran out to see what had happened. What about this vehicle.... Where did you get it from? When I received the order . I didn't have time.... ...to come to the station to get a police vehicle so.... ...I took my own... So, a personal vehicle? Yes ma'am. I didn't drive it for a while and... I took it there and then the explosion happened. listen, I could have lost my life in that explosion! I was coming from a distance.... and I noticed a flashing light under the car. I knew it was an explosive device. So I had to make a quick decision.... ...about whether or not I should take the risk and save the witness. So I did, and I saved her. We understand you have a special relationship with the witness.... How come nobody knew that before? I keep my personal life private. One last question for you. Do you know who this guy is? Yes I do. Yes I do. Yes I do who he is. Hey Cordelia, -Hey Talia. How are you doing? It could be better, but I'm fine. I went looking for you earlier. No one seems to be home for the entire evening. We decided to stay at an hotel temporary. You must be spending a lot of money. I mean, it is what we have to do right now. Come on in. -Okay. My mother just does't feel comfortable staying here anymore. Don't worry about it. We're just gonna stay there for a few days. I'm so sorry we have to break the lease but we just have to move out of town. It's just too much to handle. You have been the best tenants living on the second floor.... ...for the last five years. Don't worry about , I understand. My Mother is going to her sister's in Rhode Island. I am moving to Chicago. Cordelia you're not just a landlord to us you became family. We will miss you so much. Your mother told me about the nightmare events that have been going on. Oh, what a shame. I will miss you so much. Everything is going to be all right momma. Please, kiss auntie Jasmine for me. I want you to stay out of that apartment as much as possible. I urge you to take good care of yourself. Just sell the furniture as cheaply as possible to get out of this town. I am working on it. By Monday I'm gone. How are you today Talia Smith? Excuse me, who are you? We are from the Police Internal affairs. What is this about? We are conducting an investigation into a murder, and we need your help in this matter. Listen, I can't help you in your investigation. Why is that? Because you're planning to move out of town? Impressive but I can't help you sorry. Are you scared? Of course I'm scared. There are too many killers out here who haven't been caught yet. Someone from the police told me that not long ago. With your help we're sure we can put one of the killers out there behind bars. One out of how many? Don't waste your time. I don't want talk to you because I don't believe in you. Yesterday maybe I would have but now I know it's not worth it. Sorry. What made you change your mind? It's confidential. As you know already, I am moving out of town Good luck with your investigation. Law enforcement needs your help. Also, you should not move away, you are a material witness. No, I am not a material witness. Anyone that witnesses a murder is a material witness. We need your help weather you agree or not,... ...you will be force to corporate. - Excuse me, I know my rights. I am not going to fall for your bluff. Let me tell you exactly what's going to be happening. You booked a flight to Chicago to leave on Monday evening.... ...On Monday morning we will request an emergency hearing at the court house... ...to get an order to get you subpoenaed. Which will lead to a warrant for your arrest. We'll find you. In order to compel to testify. If you don't testify you will be held in contempt of court. Once that happens you will be behind bars until you're no longer in contempt of court. Look, I know you're innocent. I know you don't want to get involve. But there are plenty of reporters that are in jail... ...because they won't give up their sources. because they are afraid of retaliation. ...And they stay in jail until they corporate. So, do you want to help us? Or do you want to go to jail? I need some time to think about this. Today is Friday. You need to make a decision by Sunday evening. Here is our card, call us. The sooner the better. I told you get out of town, after you messed up. You didn't. I also said we will take care of her. But no, you had to send your thugs after her. I couldn't believe when I saw the photo. I've been cover your ass time after time, after time again. It keeps getting worse and worse. I am done. You better clean that mess up! You have twelve hours. No more Do you hear me? Twelve hours. No more. God damn it! I'm glad you could make it. Sure, you got my money right? That's not what this is meeting is about. I got word you're on the take.. Really? Some people are asking about your whereabouts, and your business in the hood. Interesting. Good to know. How does it get that way? I don't care. Remember the last time we met? My life depends on your right hand. - Yeah. What are you up too Sean? Now it's my turn. And I'm looking for Confirmation you're not around anymore. Don't do this Sean! No! Good bye, no longer around anymore. No! You, don't do anything stupid now. From now on you work for me understand? Take this briefcase. Take this cash. And be on your way. Well, my two favorite cops. Hey check this out. Isn't this the guy who's picture you showed me a couple days ago? Oh yeah. That's notorious Ricky Vella. I wonder what went down. I don't know, It must be some type of a drug deal that went bad. Over there are the remains of an exploded car with some dead bodies. Definitely some drug exchange that went bad. Okay. Funny enough, we've been on Ricky's trail for the longest time... We start asking you guys questions about him and he dies. I heard that. Lieutenant Baker. -Hi officer. Maybe this means some of us are doing our job. You think? -Well... We need scientific evidence. Real facts. True. But three fewer bad guys in the world. that something to be happy about. - Happy. Happy. You know when we understand. how and why this went down,... Then, we'll be happy. Fair enough. I will leave you too. Go figure! What a mess! Listen, if you leave secretly right now... ...things will get too complicated. You might wind up getting the feds involved to search for you. Plus I don't want to replace you and become the manager at the post office. I'm sorry to say but you need Henry's help to get out of this situation. He's expecting to get together soon. I just wanted to disappear from him and everything else. Well, welcome to our book club and congratulations... ...on your latest book ; The Edge of Perception. Now that is quite an intriguing title. Do you mind telling us how you came about this title? Perception is our personal experience of life through the senses... It come from our education, cultural background.... ...and the environment we grew up in. ...Which shape us to make us who we are today. All the short stories included in this book.... ...bring us to the edge of our perception of life. I mean true or not right or wrong, Good and bad.... ...are usually result from the edge of our mental impression, which define our understanding. So it's a short story book then? -Yes it is. Listen, I never mentioned this to you before. But.... ...I do believe he really loves you. You've got to go see him. This is him calling. -Come on pick it up. Hello stranger. Hey Talia, how are you doing? I'm fine. I'm here at this park, with Veronica from the post office. Well, I don't want to be a stranger. Good to hear you're not hiding in your apartment. Oh. Should I be? No, no, it's good to leave everything behind.... ...and move on as if it never happened. Just forget it. I don't know how much I can forget, but I know I gotta live my life. Right? Yeah, listen huh... Actually, I was calling to postpone for tonight. It's a bummer, I know. But I have to do this. It's my day off, and I am moving into a new place. There are urgent things I have to take care of. Something urgent from work? Kind of. Something came up earlier that I have to take care of. But look I don't want to get into that right now. Is that okay if we meet tomorrow night? Is that alright? Tomorrow Saturday night is fine. Are you all right? I'm fine, but I worry about you. Really, are you sure it's me you're concerned about? You know that it's not, moving can be overwhelming, and I wanted to see you as soon as possible. So I guess that's what bothers me. Well, you're the one who keep on postponed. That's fine with me. You take good care of yourself all right. All right you too. Later. Are you going to see him? Yeah, Don't plan to stand him up as you mentioned earlier all right. Go see him and bring a bottle of Champagne. Yeah, okay I will. Hi Talia? Didn't I just tell you I need some more time? We got some news for you. We're close to wrapping up this case and identify some people behind it. I still haven't made a decision. So you don't care about crime prevention in the community? I care about my own life in the hood. There are some corrupt officers who are involved in the murders. So, you should know more about that than I do. There is a new development. When we clean up the force. We'll make things safer for every one. Stop walking away please. Why are you so selfish? Selfish? Since when do you care about what's going on around here? All I see is my brothers and sisters getting butchered by killers under your wings inside your network. Victims of your gun distribution policies. Too many young lives have been wasted because of your selfishness. Don't put the blame on me. I want to see what tomorrow is like and grow old. Too many of us miss that opportunity, we keep dying young. I can't put an end to that. The trigger man behind the glass is out there. He's everywhere, he's watching and he's listening. When he comes for me, where will you be? We know about him. That's why we need your help more than ever. Hello it's me. It's been a week now since I saw you last. Is it really you? You better believe it. Wow, Henry.... Wow this new apartment of yours is luxurious. You must be spending a fortune. I focus on the comfort. I make the money, I spend it. Come on let's go. We were supposed to get together three days ago,... ...then you changed it to two days, then to today. What was all that rescheduling about? I see you were anxious to see me again. Ha ha. Availability. I wanted to make sure that the next time we got together you started feeling free,... Free like a bird. Free to live life to the fullest. You'll see... Just give it some time. So far the night is young. I wonder what you have in store for me tonight. Real celebration. Oh, Champagne? You know, I can just feel the celebratory mood in the air. Just my way of saying thank you... ...for saving my life. It is my duty to protect and to serve. And for you well,... I would do it over a million times, if necessary. You know... ...I think, we should give it a try again. That's the real reason why I'm here tonight. Huh, excuse me... ...I suppose to be giving away my old computer. Someone is here to pick it up. Oh well, that's what I told him. What's up brother? -What's up brother? Alright man. You're being generous huh?. -Come in. Where's the computer? You have nice company bro. Come on man sit down. Let's have a drink. It's been three days since you were supposed to pick up this computer Sean. The cover up theme for the phone conversation. I postponed it from one day to another... ...then another one until you called me yesterday to say you can come today. Busy man huh. That's why, you come here in the night when I have company. You see what I mean Talia? I just kept postponing it. Sean here is a guy that is very hard to find. He doesn't have an address,... ...and no car is registered under his name. He lives from one hotel to another. I've made an arrangement through Bogart to have a business meeting... ...so we can share some money in the drug business. What is this? You have some recording going on here. Are you wired? -Wired? No man, I'm not wired. Look, You wanna check me? Come on Sean! Listen... ...If we're gonna do business together, we need to be straightforward to protect our interests. Alright, Let's get straight to business then. I don't like that little game you're playing here Henry. Be patient brother. Okay. I'm sure you guys have seen each other in the community before. There's a point to this gathering. Talia, when I took away your cell phone,... I brought it to the police lab to retrieve deleted pictures.... So they retrieved it. My friend texted it to me. They say life is stranger than fiction, and I admit, this is interesting. What's going on here Henry? I know you're smart kid Sean. Come on Talia take a sip as well. Wait a minute. No man, I wouldn't put anything on your drink. Now come on man. That's not my style. Look. You see, no worries. I have to go to the bathroom. Alright, it's by the door over there on the left. There's a security system in this building Talia. Which I control, with this remote. No one can get out of here unless I want them to. Why do you want me to go through this? You'll find out soon. Be patient, OK. Now come on baby, sit down. What are you up to Henry? What am I up to? You see this woman Sean? I love her. I don't wanna see her out there on the street, with the same feeling that she feels inside right now. I don't want her to be in danger of facing you again on the street. What exactly are you saying? What I am saying, is that, the last time you saw each other was behind a glass,... ...now in person for the second time, and it is the last time because brother.... ...You are going down. Is that so? -For sure so. Get out! -Get out of the car now! You get out of the car! -Get out of the car come on! She's running get her! What are you doing? -Hey man get over here. Get your hand behind your back! -Do it now! We didn't do anything, fuck off! Get the fuck off me man! Get the fuck off me man! What the fuck we're getting arrested for? You know I'm connected Henry! It's over Sean. It is over. You've tried to kill us! There's no drop of pity in my veins for you. Looking at you right now makes me feel sick. You've had way too many chances. Your old man, keeps covering for you. He wipes out your crimes and your murders. But now.... ...Now he goes down with you. That's right. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Do you know who this person is? Yes I do. Who is he? Is he related to you? He is my son. Clarke Baker, you're being charged with obstruction of justice. You have the right to remain silent... ...Anything you say can and will be use against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. While you were on your way here your dad got picked up by the feds. Wow, wow... Hell no. Put it down Sean! Chill, chill, put it down. Put it down. Put it down! Good. Good, now put your hands up! You know I'm gonna get you for this. I will get you Henry. You know that. This is not how it'll end Henry. I'm gonna get you for this! This is the ghost I've heard so much about. Your time on the street is over. Take him away! You finished! Oh by the way, earlier today when Bogart was about to get pick up,... Take it easy Bogart. -I gotta go. I'm not going to jail. What are you doing? You know if you plead guilty you can get a lesser charge. Put down the gun! Come on Bogart, put the gun down! Let me go. -It doesn't have to end this way. He locked himself inside his car and shot himself. I can see there was no major incident here right? I had it under control throughout. Nice work here. The department needs more men like you. Thank you. We appreciate your help Officer Henry. -My pleasure. You too Talia. Enjoy going about the city freely now. Thank you very much. -Thank you. I heard you got a nice promotion too. That's right. - So you're the new chief now huh. You better watch it. There's a new boss in town. Well,... I'm so sorry.... ...I had to do it this way. No one knew where those guys lives.... ...I couldn't let you be on the same street where those guys were walking on. It's alright. I'm just glad it's over. Yeah. Champagne? I'm all for it.
