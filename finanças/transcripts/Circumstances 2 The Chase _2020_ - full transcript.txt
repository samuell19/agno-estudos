Anyway, how did everything go with search for the other girl? Oh, sir. The information I obtained was outdated. I spoke to a neighbor briefly and he says that no one's lived at that house in over a year. Well I guess, but in the meantime, see if you could give us updated information. I'll do. What time are we having that briefing. Ah, within the next half hour, stay close by. Of course, well do. But before I go, sir. I have a question. What's it Agent Chan? Do you think that it would be necessary for me to be the one to interrogate this girls? You know, actually that might not be a bad idea, that's a good thing. All right. But of course, you know, the prosecutors gonna wanna be present during the interrogation. They're much more valuable to us as witnesses then they are defendants. Absolutely sir. Well, I'll see you at the briefing. You worrying too much. I got this bitch. Listen pimp. I know you think you've got yo hoe on lock in all but I'm worried about them hoes that just got grabbed, all right? I don't think none of them bitches can stand up under pressure. We talking about the government Key. I understand all that, but you already briefed all of 'em anyway right? Nigga do a bear shit in the woods. Of course I did dawg. That shit don't mean nothing. Ain't none of these hoes has been under that type of microscope before blood, plus, I don't think these hoes love a nigga enough to go to a can for a nigga. I feel you, but just think of this like, like, like a test. A test. Hear me out. If these bitches stand up. That means all that allegiance they've been pledging, that was true. So you wanna use this situation as opportunity for your hoes, to prove they selve to you right now? Yeah. What better time than now T? Don't know if you fully understand. Niggas is facing real time right now, dawg. The price is too high, playboy. Just wait this shit out, man. Let that bitch Kimmie work her magic. ♪ You is niggas broke out on get it ♪ ♪ How the fuck nigga broke out of get it ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah. ♪ ♪ I don't got my motherfucking weight up ♪ ♪ Weight up ♪ So agent, just how long you've been straddling the fence Straddling the fence? I'm not sure what you're talking about. Oh, come on now. You know exactly what I'm talking about Chan. I know you've been seeing that Watson guy and you feeding him information from the Bureau. I know you've been sneaking off having meetings with him. I was there the other day when you two went on your outing at the corn beef place. Remember, right after you left the coffee house? Should I remind you what you had to eat for lunch? I just don't understand, why you stoop so low agent. I mean, not all the people to lose your life and career over, you pick this scumbag. Don't worry. I ain't told a soul, I haven't told a soul. So if I don't wanna see you go to jail, what am I gonna do? That's probably be what you're thinking, right? Cause on one hand, I do think you should go to jail with these animals. And on the other hand, I kind of feel some sense of shame and concern for you agent. Well, here's the deal agent. Today's your lucky day, you could do but two things for me and I'll completely forget about it and let you off the hook. Two things, 50,000 in cash and your resignation from the Bureau by tomorrow morning. Now I don't have to remind you what will happen if you don't meet my requests, do I? Undercover FBI agent, Indicted and brought up on charges that she violated the Bureau's Code of Ethics, as well as had relationships and providing case information to a suspected pimp that she was assigned to investigate. Now that's how that story can look, front page news, all across America. Now, I'm sure you can get the money from your new boyfriend and be sure to tell them I ain't got no problem seeing both of you go to jail for the rest of your life. Good day, agent. Y'all can't afford this pussy anyway. Oh God, you can't, nope. On my mama you can't. You can't even afford my mamas pussy, nigga. Hello Crystal. Cristal. I'm sure you know by now that, I work for the United States government and your name has come up on our radar. You have any idea why? All I know is you need to turn the fucking heat up. Listen, I don't think you realize what kind of trouble you and your friends are in. And staying silent is not gonna get you anywhere. Except maybe on a plane to USP Penitentiary for women in West Virginia. Okay, Let's, let's cut the bullshit here, okay? You are in a lot of shit and you're gonna go away to prison for a long time, okay? Unless we work together. So let's start with these. Okay, you're showing me these why? Because there is other incriminating evidence that we have Crystal. In fact, I brought a special guest to the event here. My ace in the hole you do remember Kimmie? Kimmie Crystal, Crystal Kimmy. Although Kimmie's not exactly who you think she is. In fact Kimmie works as a special agent for the FBI and her job assignment was to bring you, and your cronies down. You look really nice, in a little cop outfit Kimmie. But it's not really my type of attire Crystal, you're going away for a very long time, if you don't cooperate with us, you know that right? So what do you want me to do? They want you to tell us everything you know about Keyshawn and T.A and their activities, and then, you can go scott-free All You have to do is testify in a secret trial. And if you're called upon, which you probably will not be, you'll go to a jury. And then you tell everybody what you said today, simple. Unless I'm being charged with something at this time I just want my lawyer. You realize how many people are out there, just like yourself? They're in a maximum, 25 years or up and you keep sticking your neck out here for this guy, this bum. I understand what you're saying, but like I said, I want my lawyer. Read that. You needed to see me sir Please come in and close the door, agent. I wanna start by saying that, I've always thought that you were a fine, brilliant agent. We have a problem. It seems the only clue we have leads right to you. Problem? Sir what kind of problem? Several hundred hours of wiretap files have been deleted from our systems central hard drive. Would you happen to know anything about that? (upbeat music) Gentleman. What's really going on here? Your honor, the government has been investing a case against the men who are entangled with these women. And these men are violent and manipulative to the core. Your honor, my clients, the women, aren't a threat to society and nor should they be considered a flight risk. What the prosecutor is attempting to do by keeping these women in custody without bail, is a scare tactic. And if you ask me your honor, an act of kidnapping. Right. The petitioners, shall remain in custody without bail until the proceeding of the grand jury is completed. This is bullshit, your honor. That's enough Mr. Levitt. Now's there anything else? I have to get back to court. Let's go. (phone ringing) Hello, Mrs. Watson, this is Dr. Landry from Lake Shore Hospital. I'm calling in regards to Timothy. Is he okay? No ma'am I wish I had good news, but I don't. I'm sorry to tell you this, but last night shortly after three. (clock ticking) (door bell ringing) (bus engine revving) [U.S. Attorney] Please tell me the relationship between yourself and Mr. Watson. I plead the fifth. [U.S. Attorney] Can you please tell me the relationship between yourself and Mr. Watson? I plead the fifth. [U.S. Attorney] Listen, can you please tell me your relationship between yourself and Mr. Watson? I plead the fifth. Every girl pleads the fifth. (gun shots roaring) I'm Natalie Westbrook. They call me Natty, and, oh, yeah, he's a pimp. He beat me and others. T.A used to beat us sometimes until we passed out. I left, and his hoes jumped me. Got the indictments. Good shit bro, You know it, whoaa. So what you think about all this mess pimp? I don't know. I ain't got all the details yet T. I'm just trying to figure out, what kinda charges are they gone try to pin on us. But I'm gonna get a full report from Kimmie tonight Yeah, man, it's just cold shit though. Trying to pin niggas for pimp. Well peep this, you know, this country was founded on illicit activities, right? After they established they land which they stole trying to put regulations on niggas, man. Trying to prevent us from making our mark in the world. Straight pussy shit. Shit it's yo turn pimp. I know. (indistinct) So what all did he say about that Natty bitch? It was the DA dude, he just asked if I knew who she was, and when I said no, he knew I was lying. I guess they had information from sources confirming that she was with you when we met. Sources, huh? Uh hum. I see. I'm sure they didn't reveal who those so-called sources was, huh? That shit don't even surprise me. Her testimony wasn't even a deciding factor in their indictment. She really was just another piece to the puzzle that was going to get found with or without her funky ass. Daddy, I never liked that bitch. That slut has done nothing but cause trouble, since I've been here. We should have killed that punk ass that day. Or kick her and throw her waste box out. I know, right. (thunder rumbling) I'm here, where are you? I'll be right there Agent, relax. How long? I thought you'd be prompt. I'll be right there. (thunder rumbling) You know Chan. I'm not at all surprised that you actually showed up here today. I mean you are kind of witty when it came to reason. But this thing with you and the pimp. I mean, we got his black ass in a sling, so it's not like you, anybody else could do anything about it. What do you want the? Meritorious Achievement Award or some shit? Okay, you grew a sense of humor, which is cool. But I hear being a single mom is a bit of a pain in the ass. Yeah, well, I'm sure it couldn't be any worse than having no life after work, agent. Enough of the funny, where's the money? Here's your money, but before I give it to you. I need your assurance, that you will stick to your word and you won't try any funny business after all this. Me giving my word is all you got. And I know that don't mean nothing to you. However, I hold the remote to this show. So therefore just sit back and watch. Now give me my fucking money. (thunder rumbling) Now I bet it's all here but just in the event that it ain't, this lil meeting that we had here tonight. Will be null and void, goodnight agent. (gun shots roaring) (foot steps pattering) Perfect time fellas. Toss the burner. (door hinges squeaking) I was surprised you gave me the time of day. Well, yeah, if you play your cards right, this could be good for the both of us. So you said your name was Brett, right? Yes Brett. Uh, and this is your place. Uh hum. Nice place you got here Brett Make yourself at home, would you like some dessert? Umm yeah, you got a rest room I can use first? Of course, second door on your right. All right baby, I'll be right back. (high-heels clattering) (glass clinking) How's the drink baby? Pretty good actually. Yeah, it's done. You ain't gone keep your pants on this time, are you? Toby, you know I don't like taking them off right away. Come on now, ain't nobody coming out this late and you know it. Okay, baby I love you. Toby somebody's out there. Oh my God, I hope they not carrying in that bag what I think they are. Be quite. Oh My God, Toby we gonna do something. Shut up, there's nothing we can do. That person in that bag is already dead. Just stay calm until they leave. Otherwise, I know they gonna kill us. It's time to get the fuck out of here. And I'm calling the police.

Yes, we've lost a fine young agent. What happened? Well, that we're not too sure of. The only thing we do know at this point Is that he was taken by a group of black males in an unknown make and model black truck. That's odd. Tell me about it, I'm leaving in a few minutes to find out more firsthand. We have two teens here now that seemed to have witnessed it all. And they claim to have physical descriptions of the suspects. Just waiting on Washington to give us the green light to take over the investigation. I'm sure by now that hick police department has screwed up the entire crime scene. Let's hope not, I just, I can't believe this. Not Daley. I don't know what kind of animal would have done such a thing? What do you want me to do? Not to worry agent we're on it. Finish the things you were already working on. I hear the apprehension of Watson and Smith went well. That's good. We can't let these bastards get away with anything. Excuse me sir, the conference room is ready for the briefing. The briefing? What briefing? With the media. - Oh, right. Let's make this quick. Good looking woman you've got there. Oh, I see. You're a hard ass.

Damn I'm glad that bitch pulled our coattail when she did Hello, Mr. Smith, Special Agent In Charge Sydney Bender. Mind if we talk for a few minutes? Man, talk about what homie? You guys are in a lot of trouble. We have witnesses, wire tabs, a whole list of things. Basically. I have two choices here, my man. Can either tell us all that you know or go away for the remainder of your youth. Say man, when do I get to see the judge? Last thing you need to be worried about right now is seeing a judge, brother. What you need to focus on is helping us and helping you Man, get outta here. I ain't trying to hear that bullshit. Y'all do what y'all gotta do to me and my lawyers yeah that's right motherfucker. I said lawyers. We'll do the same. Now, if you don't mind, I got some shit to think about.
