Two months, then I'm off. (Chuckling) - Well, that's what you said last year and the year before. - And the year before the year before. - Ah, this time, and I told him so, I've got this incurable affliction. It's called sea fever. (Chuckling) Well, better get to work. - Chief. - Captain. - Morning, Chief. - Morning, Andrew. Thank you! (♪ Rock on radio ) - Mmm! - What is that? - Breakfast! - Breakfast? I don't eat breakfast. (Sighing) - Yeah, you wouldn't. OK! (Birds chirping) (Cars honking) - I borrowed this. Do you mind? - No! It looks better on you! - Will I see you tonight? - Tonight? Gee, no, I can't. I--I've got a lecture. - Afterwards! I'll make you dinner. - Dinner? No, no, no. I don't eat dinner. You OK? - Yeah! - Listen, I'm sorry. I gotta go now. But just close the door behind you when you leave, hmm?

Can I help you, please? - 4:00, promptly. - (Man): Camera Crew 3 to Studio A for color lineup... - Good morning, Miss Grayson. - Morning, Miss Grayson. - Good morning, good morning, good morning! - Morning, Jimbo! Cigarette? Sorry, forgot you quit. (Chuckling) - Listen, run this over with Freddie, will you? - Sure! - Gotta have a word with Lucrezia Borgia. - Good luck! - Ah! Good morning, princess! Good morning! - That schmuck, Fulton! Couldn't you find somebody better? Eh, and what about that stuff on Diana Brockhurst? How good is it? - Ah, it's a good 3 minutes! - Sure? - Sure. - Mm-hmm. Must be worth at least one good minute, eh? (Door closing) - Ready? Check the level. (Staff talking simultaneously) - Yeah, they look OK to me. - This is Maggie Grayson. - Does it show? Can you tell? - We'd like to welcome you to 90 minutes of news and interviews. - No! No, you can't tell. - Our cameras were at the airport last night to greet a local celebrity. Mayor Dudley and his charming wife were at the airport to welcome them. Only recently widowed from her second husband, the European publishing giant, David Lautrec... - Herman! Herman! Herman, you're on television! (Crowd applauding on TV) - Diana's here for the dedication of the new hospital, built right smack in the derelict downtown part of our city. - Look, it's you! It's you! - Diana is our special... - What were you doing at the airport? You didn't tell me you-- - I have nothing to say, except that I hope that you'll all be there for the dedication ceremony tomorrow. (Dudley chuckling) - We all thank you, and we're proud that you're home. - The hospital is a memorial to her first husband, the late Governor Paul Brockhurst. She herself has endowed the hospital with a trust of $3 million, a generous gesture. Diana is now worth a modest $35 million. Welcome home, Diana. And now for the weather forecast. (Television clicking) (Kissing teeth) - $35 million! - Oh, Herman, you did it! - I've got an important meeting this morning. - Don't forget your lunch! - Mr. Clark. - Who's Mr. Clark? - Just keep your fingers crossed. - Hmm! Bye! - (Man): Discussing the water shortage today is Maggie Grayson's guest... - I'll take care of the zoning board, but you better handle Carson yourself. And the flowers for Diana's room were delivered. - The mayor's office issued a release, indicating that the water reserves were slightly over 40%. - My information says that it is much lower than that. - Of course, you can't tell us where you got that information. (Laughing) Alderman, you've been wrong about Mayor Dudley before. - Go get 'em, Maggie! - I'm appalled! Mayor Dudley-- (Switch clicking) - That son of a bitch! He's starting his campaign for mayor! Why can't he wait until I'm governor? I could kick him in the ass. - Never get into a pissing contest with a skunk. - How'd he find out about the water? (Thudding in distance) - Uh, thanks. - Hey! Give my regards to Diana. If I were 20 years younger, I'd fight you for her. - You'd lose! (Laughing) (Knocking on door) Well! Just like the good old days, huh? - Champagne's the same. - What does that mean? - Edith looked good last night. You too. Every inch a governor. I mean, even I'd vote for you. - Diana... I still love you. (Telephone ringing) - Hello? Monsieur Pierre! Uh, pas maintenant. Non. Uh, Rappelez-moi demain à 3h00. Non, notre heure. (Chuckling) C'est bien, ça. Au revoir. - As I was saying... I still love you. You remember Saint-Tropez? - This isn't Saint-Tropez. - I am still the same, and you're still the same. - No, I'm not. - Oh yeah. - No! (Grunting) (Camera clicking) (Men talking, indistinct) - Morning, guys. - Morning! - Good morning! (Car honking) - No, Doctor. - Blood pressure. - Damn dirty politicians! They always have to have their finger in the pie! - Morning, Andrea. - Morning! We lost power in the west wing this morning. - What? - Yes! - The doctor will be with you in a moment, Mrs. Adams. - Mrs. Adams! You again? This makes, uh, the 3rd one in a little over 2 years? What's the matter, girl? Can you remember and practice what the doctor taught you? (Sighing) (Chuckling) Obviously not. Frank. - Yeah. - Would you believe our backup generator has only got half the juice we need? We're very lucky that this hospital isn't fully operational yet, or we'd be in the-- up to here. - Dr. Mars, continue with the rounds, would you, please? - (Woman on PA): Patients are reminded that visiting hours do not start until 13:00. - Oh, sorry! Oh, Doctor? - Mm-hmm. - I'd like you meet one of our new nurses, Miss Florence Stoddard, uh, Dr. Whitman. - How do you do, Doctor? - We've met. Nice to have you with us, Miss Stoddard. - Dr. Beckstein. Dr. Beckstein. - This way, Doctor! To the left. (Knocking on door) - Uh-huh? - Mr. Clark? Herman Stover. - Oh yes! Yes, of course! Come in, Stover. Stover, we have an opening in research. We'd like you to consider switching to that department. - Research? - Interesting opportunities in that branch, you know. - Twelve years in maintenance, they promised me I'd make foreman. - Your aptitude test shows that you would serve the company better in Research and Development. - I belong in maintenance. I don't know anything about research. I'm in maintenance. - I take this to mean that you won't accept the transfer? - I wanna be foreman. - The committee already decided on Kershaw. - Kershaw? I ain't working for Kershaw! - Very well. You'll get the usual severance pay and one week's vacation. You can present this to the paymaster. Good luck, Stover. - No, I don't want to. Here, take this! Come on, Debbie! - Here, Mommy! Faster! (Giggling) - Hey, Gerald! Why don't you come up? - Mom! - OK, but don't you be late for lunch now. - I won't! - Come on, sweetheart. - Hey! What you guys doing? - Shhh! - Mrs. Bogdanovich, Debbie's in bed, but I'll be back as soon as I can. - Oh, if I hear the little one cry, I'll go right up! - OK, thanks! (Train horn blowing in distance) - Come on, Joe, light up! - Well... - You gotta drag on it, meathead! (Coughing) Stand back, everybody! He's gonna up his Cornflakes! - Fi--fi--fire! Fire! - Come on! Let's get out of here! Come on, Robbie! Hustle! - I'm coming, I'm coming! Get going! Get going! - Debbie, make 6 photocopies of this. Send them up today. - Yes, sir. (Telephone ringing) - What? I can't hear you, son. - My number is 720 Birchwood Avenue! - Let's go! - My number is 720 Birchwood Avenue! (Sirens wailing) - Waller, start putting them out! - OK, guys, let's move it! (Coughing) - Mommy! (Coughing) (Siren wailing in distance) - Start getting the people out of those houses. - They might lose it. - Right away, sir. Waller, give the police a hand. - Yes, Captain. - Captain Risley here. Get me the chief, will ya? - Captain Risley reporting from Birchwood, Chief. - What do we got, Harrison? - Three brick structures loaded with wood and a couple of old garages. Roof's starting to cook too. Can't hold it. - Andrew, where's Company 3? - They're over at the new hospital for the dedication. What can I tell you? The mayor wanted a band. - Well, tell Company 3 to get their butts over to Birchwood now! - Yes, Chief. - All right, Captain, your reinforcements are coming. Mayor wanted a band! (Firefighters shouting, indistinct) - Test one-two, one-two, one-two. Master Control, have you got a picture? - We don't have a picture yet, John. - The power supply's screwed up. - Aw, Christ! Come on, you guys, hurry up! - We'll be back in a moment. - OK, guys, take five. We're on a break. - This station joins the American... - Hey, Jimbo, we're getting picture from Mobile One at the Birchwood fire. - ...America's No. 1 fitness personality.

OK. - Oh, Debbie! - It's all right. Stay here. - Oh my God! Debbie! - Is there someone in the house? - That's my little girl! - Captain! There's a kid in the house. - (Captain): Let's move! (Sobbing) - What's that? We just learned that, apparently, there's a little girl inside the house. They're gonna find out what's going on here. - Debbie! Where's Debbie? - I only went to the store for the carrots! Just to the store! - Mom, Debbie's up there! - What room is she in? - Second floor, back room! - Hey, hey! - Gerald! - Stand back. - NO! - Keep your boy back, please. - Stand back, ma'am. Come on, get back here, please. - Jimbo, you're live with the remote. We'll intercut to the spreading of the fire with the trapped kid, OK? - Get back. Back, back. Ma'am! Ma'am! Can I speak to you a moment, please, ma'am? Ma'am, can you turn to the camera? Just speak to the camera over here. - Oh my God! - Cut this way. - Ma'am, we'd just like to ask you a couple questions. - No! - Is your daughter in there? Is she in there? Is your daughter inside? - Oh, Debbie! - The stairs are gone! Come on! Give her to me! I got her! Now you get the hell out of here! (Screaming) - They're coming out now, and the girl is with them. There's only one fireman that's come out. Two have gone in. We can only tell that the girl is unconscious as she comes out. (Reporter on TV, indistinct) - Chief! - We have no idea what has happened to her. She was in the fire from the beginning, and as you can see, the flames are really becoming very strong. One of the firemen is still trapped inside. We see Captain Risley going back in with a couple other firemen. They're obviously trying to save their buddy still inside that burning building, the flames going higher and higher all the time. The heat must be fantastic inside that building. They've gone in to save their buddy. (Man on radio, indistinct) - Get a pulse. - I'm trying. Can't get a reading. Her eyes are dilated. Asphyxia. Try direct pressure. - Debbie, please don't die. Please don't die! - Move her! - I'll stop smoking. I promise! - Let's get her in the ambulance. Get her up! This way! - What happened? Is she all right? Is she dead or what? What happened? He still breathing? Did you get a pulse? What happened? Do you know what happened? What happened there? Did you get her name? What? Is she unconscious or what? The flames are now licking out of the ceiling, the roof. - OK, Captain, leave him to us. Let's get the belt on him. Come on! - Here it is. - I got it. That's it. That's it. - Come on, let me through. - Yeah, OK. - Can I talk to you for a moment, please? - Piss off! - Is he going to die? - Get out of here! It's on. Let's get him out of here. - Did support get here yet? - I don't know! Let me pour the water on it. (Firefighter shouting, indistinct) - Get that hose down! Get the fire! - Guys! Come on! - ...the building on the side there off to our right, as our cameras look at it right now. We'll be watching this fire very closely... - Andrew, have Units 4 and 11 stand by. Get me Captain Risley. - Roger. - ...reporting for Channel 10, Action News. (Siren wailing on TV) - So good of you to come early, Mrs. Lautrec. It allows me to show you our beautiful hospital. - Hello, Mr. Lewis. How's Mrs. Lewis? - Fine! Fine! - Good. - Sir Henry. - Hello! - Mr. Sterling. His assistant, Mr. Zacharov. - Hello. - This way, Mrs. Lautrec. - I got you, Diana, baby! Muah! (Laughing) "Two-time loser Diana goes for number three!" - No, no! "Does Mrs. Dudley know what Mayor Dudley do?" (Laughing) - "Diana and Mayor Dudley living it up. Heartbroken wife seeks divorce and custody of children!" (Both laughing) (EKG monitor beeping and ventilator whirring) - Here, let me do that. (Beeping) Get me a vial of bicarbonate. Half CC of epinephrine. Let's try a shock. Everybody stand back. (EKG beeping rapidly) (Beeping slowly) (Beeping stops) (Beeping continuously) Notify Chief Risley. - Enjoy the show, Diana? - Let's continue, Mr. Lewis. - No, no, no. Allow me. For 3 million bucks, she's entitled to it. International symbols: clever drawings by clever people. Sign language. No words! Trouble is you need someone to tell you what the no words don't mean. You look older. - I am older. - I guess jet-setting around, you know, marrying one guy, burying another, I'd look older too. - Hear you're only good for bed and breakfast. - Oh, sometimes they skip the breakfast. By the way, the story is that, uh, I had to go to bed with you to get this job. - Really? Well, if we did go to bed, it couldn't have been terrific, 'cause I don't remember it. - No, I think if I made a house call, I think you'd remember it, all right. - (Chuckling): Ooh! Is it tough being accused of bedding your way to the top? - Morning! Hmm? (Woman on PA, indistinct) - I loved Paul. I loved David. - Yeah. - I did! - Mm-hmm. - I loved all the men I went to bed with. - All the men. Well, how many were there? - How many with you? - Oh, don't know. 200, 300. No, no, no. I had a bicycle. (Laughing) - Still fast. I paid $3 million for this walk, but could we get it over with? - Doctor, how's my sister? - Hello, Gerald. I think she's got a very good chance. Is your father coming to get you? - You sure my sister will be all right? - You bet she will be. Excuse me. (Chirping) - Oh, she's pretty! Is she yours? - Shhh! Mrs. Bogdanovich brought her for Debbie, but birds aren't allowed here. - Oh! Well, you better hide her over there. - We went to the same school. Same lousy neighborhood. The pits. Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec. And me. She started the year I graduated. Every senior at Sycamore High was in love with her. And she goes and marries some guy 30 years older. A governor. 30 years older. - Cute! - Nobody listens. - It's OK, Herman. I'll go and mop over there. - Yeah, why don't you do that? Then she goes and marries another old man. Hmm! Hmm! But you're gonna listen. - Hey, boss! What's wrong with the stacks? - Christ, we're building up a lot of pressure! (Alarm blaring) (Siren wailing) - I know that, but you-- - Diana! Dr. Whitman. - Johnny? Aha! I was beginning to think you were avoiding me. - Oh, I'd never forget you, Diana. And I'm never very far, believe me. - You old fox! - I hope you change your mind and join us on the speaker's platform, Dr. Whitman. - No, I don't think so, really. - It would look better, you know, the head of a new hospital. - It may have looked better, but I don't think it would sound better. I don't think you'd like what you'd be hearing. - What's eating you now? You have a new job. The city has a beautiful new hospital. - That's right. Some new hospital! It looks real good on the outside. But thanks to your political favors here and there, see, I'm stuck with a patch-up job. - Well, nothing is perfect. Everything is compromised. Now, if you're the mayor of a big city and you wanna get things done, you have to learn to give and take. - Try talking to a surgeon about compromise during an open-heart operation, huh? - Uh, Dr. Whitman. When I call on you, I expect you to come up and speak. - Is that a challenge? - If you'd like to put it that way. - Well, you just do that, Mr. Mayor. I look forward to it. - Listen, Boss, we're in a hell of a mess here. The steam power's broken. (Siren wailing) - Is it true you're running your late husband's publishing house? - That's right. - Does that mean there's a new man behind you? - None that I can see. - You gonna get married again, Diana? (Chuckling) - Well, if I do, you'll be the first to know. - Johnny, where's the band? - Well, there's a big fire going on. - This is gonna be on TV, for Christ's sake! - Hello, Vans. Hey, George. Rob, good to see you. - Mr. Mayor, can I have a word with you? - Uh, no. A little later, OK? - OK, remotes 4, 5 and 6 stand by for the pickup of the dedication. After Mrs. Lautrec, we're gonna cut back to Birchwood. - Make-up! Hey! (Snapping fingers) - (Man): All that protects your engine is a layer of oil this thin... - You look gorgeous, princess! Gorgeous! OK, stand by, one. Stand by, Maggie. - Shell Super Multigrade. - Out, fade up Maggie. - And now to the dedication ceremonies of our new hospital where Mayor Dudley and Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec are the guests of honor. (Crowd applauding) - You look very chic, sir. - I'll take it. (Car honking) (Horns and sirens blaring) (Blaring stops) - OK, we can go again. - And to have his name on a memorial devoted to life as he was devoted to life and to people would please him enormously. He loved this city and was proud of its success, particularly the last 10 years. And so it's with great joy that I present the check for $3 million to the chairmen of the board of directors. (Both talking, indistinct) - (Both): OK. - Captain Risley reporting. Birchwood is a controlled situation. I repeat, Birchwood is under control. - Harrison. - Yes, Chief? - Harrison, Joe Waller didn't make it. I'll go see his wife myself. Did a good job at Birchwood, Captain. - Thank you, sir. (Screaming) - I would like to introduce to you now the new head of the Brockhurst Hospital. It was not an easy choice. It was quite difficult. - Well, see ya! Have a good day! - You too. - Well, let's get this thing on the road. (Talking indistinctly) (Screaming) - What the hell was that? - What the fuck's going on? - Holy shit! That was on the air! - Uh, um... (Chuckling) (Explosion in distance) - At the refinery! (All screaming) (All screaming) - Attention! Let me have your attention! Do not panic! - Are you all right? Ow! (Whitman on mic, indistinct) - Johnny! - I gotta get to a phone! - Can I help? I'm a paramedic. - Let's get him out of here. (Sirens wailing) - Help me! Somebody, please help me! - It's all right. Come on, get up. - (Whitman): Doctors! Nurses! Help everyone who is hurt inside... - Lift him up. - Put your arm on my shoulder. - Do not panic! We will help you. - That's it! Come on! OK! OK? - Hold on, hold on! Here, lean on me. (All clamoring) Switch over to emergency power immediately. Harper, have all staff report to me as soon as possible. Clear out that receiving area. Clear it out! (Siren wailing) (Explosions) - That refinery's leveled. Over 60 fires have started already. Haven't been able to reach the mayor to get a Code 9, so I'm assuming command. Mike, radio the governor to mobilize the National Guard. - Yes, Chief. - Johnson, contact Temple County. Ask the National Park Service for the tanker planes. - Yes, sir! - Martin, call the Parker Airfield about some mission choppers. - Yes, sir. - Everyone, and I mean everyone, is subject to immediate recall. Stellhoff. - Yes, sir. - I wanna talk to both Police Chief Abrams and Councilman Palin. - God, this is it! This is really it! Just imagine, Jimbo. Every station on the network, and they want me. - You gonna do it without cameras, Maggie? (Chuckling) - Oh, is that the best you can do? - I'm sorry, Miss Grayson. All the roads are blocked. I had to fish into wardrobe for these. - Listen, what about that Birchwood crew? - Already taking care of that. - Hmm, good. What a goddamn mess! - Darling, do sit still! - What about the crew from the dedication ceremony? - Yeah, we can use it. - Good. Put 'em on the roof! - The roof? - Yes! - Maggie, you're a genius! - I know! I know! Oh, can't you do something about these lines? - Maggie, darling, only God can perform miracles. - Out! Out. Both of you! The hell out of here! (Sighing) (Sighing) - (Man): We'll get a picture on our monitors, Jimbo. (Reporters on TV, indistinct) Standby car is ready. All right, stand by to cue Maggie. Stand by, one. Stand by, Maggie. (Man talking, indistinct) Whole world's on fire and that turkey picks now to get loaded. - Ten seconds. Nine, eight... - Seven, six... - This is Maggie Grayson reporting. At 12:37, the Manson Refinery, the 9th largest in the world, erupted with devastating force. The cause is as yet unknown. The massive refinery, built against public protest, covers some 300 acres and has a supposed storage capacity of 15 million gallons. The initial casualty reports are staggering. And fires are raging out of control all over our city. The multiple explosions have created havoc and total destruction of a large part of the city. (Siren wailing) (Gasping) (Tray clattering) (Yelping) - Get an IV started, Ringer's lactate. Put him on 100% oxygen. I want a urinary catheter, an NJ2. Now move, move, move! - (Woman on PA): Dr. Pratt. Dr. Pratt to OR-4. (Groaning) 47-C is now clear and ready to receive incoming patients. - How you feeling? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. A hell of a mess in this one, Johnny, I put for that refinery. - Yeah, that's the risk of politics. Yesterday, you're a hero, and today, you're a fool for exactly the same reason. - Come on, come on! I don't know what the hell to do. Can't get through on the phone to Risley or Abrams or anybody. - Now it's bad. But you can turn it around, make it good. - Goddammit, Johnny! Don't humor me! Don't know how to deal with this one. On top of it all, you picked today to go ahead and get a heart attack. (Grunting) Hey, Johnny! - Never... Never admit that you were wrong about the refinery. - Now, don't you go dying me, for Christ's sake! Come on! (Chuckling) - You'll be governor. You'll do it. Bet you 7 bucks you'll do it, kid! Huh? (Man coughing) (Women 1 on PA, indistinct) - (Woman 2): Dr. Carr. Dr. Carr. - Doctor, I'm looking for my-- - Go to reception. - Dr. Carr. Dr. Carr. - Doctor, the IV's empty. - Hmm? Give the D5W. (Man moaning) - Dr. Whitman, take a look at this, please. - Just prep him for OR. - Yes, Doctor. (Women on PA, indistinct) - Miss Harper. I want everybody out of the hospital. Everybody except patients and doctors. That means all visitors, administrative staff, security guards, everybody out. Try the Prince Street exit. That'll still be safe. I want you to do it right now. We need all the room for the sick ones. - Oh my God! - We need oxygen! - I can't! Oh! (Spitting) - Diana! (Spitting, coughing) I found some, Diana. Found some. - You know how to work that thing? - I'll figure it out. - Hope so, 'cause I don't think I can do that again. Come on, hurry up! - OK! - Doctor! Please, my son. - OK, come on, son. (Baby crying) - Now we have to find him a room. - There aren't any. - Well, we'll find some! - We're gonna put you down right over here, OK? Here you are. - Nurse-- - All visitors out of the hospital! - Please! - No, I mean now! Come on! (Clapping hands) (Boy screaming, joint cracking) - Sorry, lady, we need this room. - Hey, you can't take me out of here. I'm gonna have a baby! A baby born in a corridor is illegitimate! - I don't like it, Sam. Those fires look awful close to me, and they're getting closer. - Well, just think of your pension. - I am thinking about it. I'm thinking about how I wanna live to collect it. - Man, will you get to work? - The casualties are now close to 3,000. To complicate matters, water pressure has fallen considerably. Despite the help of neighboring communities, the scattered locations of fires... - Does it show? Can you tell? - ...are more than combined firefighters. - No, you can't. - And now, as night approaches, looting has begun. - Nah, you can't tell. The hell you can't! Jesus! - ...more than the National Guard and the police can cope with. ♪ ♪ (Siren wailing) (Shouting indistinctly) - Wish to hell he'd start smoking again and be nice. - (Man): Zoom in on that, please. (Reporters on TV, indistinct) (Cars honking) - Look, I just wanna get in there! - No. - I'm not a looter! I just wanna get the pictures! - You got the pictures? - No! - I can! - Leave me alone! - I'll try! - No, Terry! (Grunting) (Screaming) (Tires screeching) OK, Terry! It'll be OK! - Real bad shape. - 187 fires have already been reported out of control. Here, here and here. We have little chance of preventing total destruction. I recommend we evacuate the areas immediately. Prepare for demolition to prevent the fires from spreading any further. - Chief Risley, I do think we should first confer with Mayor Dudley. - Councilman, if you can contact him, you confer. In the meantime, I'll take the responsibility. Andrew, what's the latest forecast? - Hot, dry weather with northeasterly winds increasing 20-30 miles an hour. - Gentlemen, gather around. Take a look. Here's the hospital. Only the area to the south of the hospital is unthreatened so far. - The hospital's gonna burn! We just built the damn thing! - My biggest concern right now is a firestorm. - A what? - If the fire surrounds the hospital, it'll burn up the oxygen. The people will suffocate. We've got to find a way to communicate with the hospital. - The TV high-angle shots were taken from the roof of the Brockhurst Hospital. Maybe there's a way to talk to them up there. - What are you waiting for? Get in touch with the station. - Yes, sir! - Is anybody-- - I'm here, Nurse! - Nurse Collingwood to X-ray. Nurse Collingwood to X-ray. - Yeah. We understand, Jimbo. You can count on us. - Sam... (Siren wailing) - Thanks, Jimbo! We're doing our best. Yeah. - Sam, the fire's getting closer. - Get going! You heard the man! - Patients are requested to board the vehicles outside in an orderly fashion. There is no cause for alarm... - Can I help you with that? - No, I don't need any help. I went to medical school for 3 years. - What medical school taught you to do this? All right, hero, listen. Why don't you help, uh, get all those people into the trucks, huh? Come on, come on. Get out of here. (Breathing heavily) - Uh, have you had babies before? - Ah, sure! Two! - Oh, well, uh, do you think you have to have this one right now? - For you, maybe another half an hour. - Oh, good girl! (Chuckling) (Groaning) - OK, move along! Come on, everybody! That's it. Right to the back. Right to the back. - There is no cause for alarm... Hospital personnel will be traveling with you. - Come on, everybody out! Let's go! - Come on, keep moving! - You mind telling me what's going on out here with the ambulances? - Ah, not a bit, Mr. Mayor! You know, it seems that there was some idiot who let them build a refinery right in the middle of the city, and this is the result! And I bet it was you. I really would like to hear you talk yourself out of this boo-boo. - Do you mind telling me what's going on out here? - Doctor's orders. Dr. Whitman wants the rest of the hospital evacuated in a hurry. You could do both of us a favor, Mr. Mayor. Get yourself in one of those trucks. Least this will keep you out of the governor's mansion. - Don't take any bets on it. - Well, I ain't gonna vote for you! (Siren wailing) (Children screaming) - Children! Children! - Hey, gang!
