That one is... on the right. I see. Now try the other eye. Yes. What about this one? That one is... on the left? Could you wait here, please? Thanks. I've been exposed to a lot of radiation. Look, look! The lottery. 1.2 billion! Does anyone really win the lottery? Of course they do, look! How do you know it's not a con? It's amazing! 1.2 billion? Amazing, amazing! Hello. Do you have a loyalty card? A loyalty card? If you get a loyalty card, you can save a lot of money. Thank you very much. Hello! We are in a state of emergency. Only leave the home if it is absolutely necessary. Wear a mask and wash your hands regularly. Watch out! Pick it up! Pick it up! Look what you did, you ill-mannered lout! Here, have a seat. Slow down. Take your time. In the middle, gently. Do it slowly. Yes. Slower... slower. That's it. Slowly. That's it, that's it! Hey, concentrate. Thanks, I'm off. Goodnight. Don't catch cold.

Slipped! Stop! Box. Keep your guard up! Time's running out! I'll film it. I have the judges' scores. Judges Takashi Matsuo and Kei Tsuchiya: 39 to 37. Judge Aren Kato: 38 to 38. The winner by a 2-0 decision... in the blue corner, Keiko Ogawa! Thank you. Boss. Keiko's mother is here. Congratulations on the win. I can't believe she can fight in the ring like that. It's all thanks to everyone at the gym. Thank you so much. It's all her own doing. She got a bit beaten up today. Treat her to something nice to eat. Keiko is this way. Thank you. A big smile, please! And another one! Let's have a smile! Smile! A smile, okay? Did you take these? No, Mum did. She says she couldn't eat a thing before your fight. Terrible photos, aren't they? After the fight, did she say anything about me? You should ask her yourself. Your opponent went straight to the hospital after the fight. Thanks for talking to me. No, thank you. Let's start, then. I hear this is the oldest gym still operating in Japan. It opened after the war, in 1945. My father started it. This area of Tokyo wasn't too badly damaged by the air raids. I took over from my father. But it won't keep going after me. I don't have any children. When did you first meet Ms Ogawa? It must have been about two years ago. As she's a girl, I thought it was for losing weight or her health. That sort of thing, you know? But she was really enthusiastic. She already had the basics of boxing, but was rough round the edges. She came in almost every day, and trained as hard as any man. So... I asked her if maybe she wanted to turn pro. And she said yes. It was the first time I'd heard her voice. "Yes." Isn't being deaf a serious disadvantage? Well, it's fatal really. She can't hear the referee or the bell. She can't hear her seconds. It couldn't be more dangerous. They wouldn't even let her have a training fight at her previous gym. You can understand them. What are some of the challenges she faces in training? Keiko has good eyes. She watches intently. It takes a bit of time, but that's not really a problem. A good eye. Why do you think Ms Ogawa took up boxing? That's a good question. She was bullied as a child and got into trouble because of that. That's what her mother told me. She had a rough time in high school, even hitting a teacher. That could be it, so she'd win any fights she got into. But no, I don't really think so. You know, when you're boxing, your head empties out. We call it "nothingness". I I guess that feels good to her. Was Ms Ogawa able to turn pro because of some special talent? I don't think she has a particular talent. She's small, she has no reach, she's not fast enough. How can I put it? She has a big heart. She's honest and straightforward. She's really nice. How long do you plan to keep on boxing? Haven't you done enough? You became a professional, and that's a great thing. But isn't it enough now? You won. Congratulations! Thank you. That's quite a shiner! Wounded with honour! No, it's embarrassing. Aren't you tired? You should have taken some time off after the fight. If I take a break, I feel like I'm slacking. You're amazing! I can't believe you box and I couldn't do that. The boxing is just to get rid of the stress from work. Don't tell anyone I said that! I'm looking forward to your next fight. Thanks, bye. Thanks, goodnight. Excuse me. Are you at high school? What are you doing here at this hour? I see. You're deaf. What happened to your face? Your face! What happened? In a fight? What do you mean? Well... be careful! I have reached the limit of my energy and strength. That sounds like a top sumo wrestler retiring. Take it seriously. I am taking it seriously. No. I can't think of what to say. With fewer members because of the pandemic, and land redevelopment forcing us out... When I've sorted everything out here at the gym, why don't we go on holiday? To some places we've never been. Where could we go? A hot-spring resort, first of all. Yeah, a hot spring. Okinawa might be nice as well. We went there on our honeymoon. It was nice, wasn't it? I'd prefer the hot spring. When is your next fight? In about two months. What do you like about boxing? Punching makes me feel good. Don't you get scared? Of course I get scared. I'm relieved to hear that. What do you mean? So you are normal, after all! How dare you! Punching and getting punched... insane! I understand. - I'm ready. - Let's do it, then. - Shall we start with the basics? - Yes. - Are you right-handed? - Yes. Place your feet a shoulder width apart. Relax your shoulders. Right foot back a shoulder width. That's it. Both hands up. Left hand in front of your face. Right hand to the side of the chin, arms in tight. Now you're going to jump, and stop where you land. Stop! And stay put. Right foot. Hold it there. Don't lose your balance. Okay, that's it. That's your centre of gravity. That's the basic posture. Keep your left hand forward. You weren't watching there. You took about six punches in a row. Why don't you have your guard up properly? Such a waste! You plunge forward because you're scared. Don't get scared. If you're too excited and plunge forward, you're in danger. It's important to control your emotions. I don't like getting hurt Nobody likes that. You're really honest. Honest. Matsumoto, let's do a bit. Okay. Face guard. - Gloves? - Yeah, everything. Got you. Stop, stop. Do you understand? Stop, stop. Block, block. Change over. Your turn. No, no. Don't step back. Come forward. Bend your knees. You're moving back. Come forward. Stay put. Okay? I'm going slowly. You're stepping back. Get the rag. It's over there. Shall we take a break? Nice. Yes. And again. At full stretch. That's nice. Hello! And that'll do! Okay. - Do some shadow boxing. - Yes. What's the matter? Hurry up and get changed. Actually... can you give this to the chairman, please? You should go and tell him yourself. Why are you quitting? You only bother with the girl. I don't think I can improve here. Also, I've heard that the gym will be closing soon. I'm grateful for all you've done. Thank you. Back to work! Takaya. Ready? Your blood-sugar level, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels are all high. Which means the arteriosclerosis is getting worse. Also, your eyesight has deteriorated a lot since previous tests. As for the risk of a stroke... you've already had one, right? Yes, but that was 10 years ago. That doesn't mean you don't risk another. We'd better do a thorough examination. But my husband seems perfectly fine. No. By the time it becomes apparent, it's too late. For example, a tiny raindrop, over a long period of time, can make a hole in a hard stone. So, even though you don't notice it yet, there's a slow but sure erosion. - Mrs Aoki. - Yes. - In the examination room. - Yes. Dear Chairman... I would like to take a break... Concentrate! Four, five, nice! Six, seven, eight, okay, nine. Okay, Junpei, that's good. Now change sides. Good punching. Get your breath back. - Darling. - Yes? Yes. Two beers? Just a moment. Everybody gather round, please. I'll just come straight out with it. We're going to close the gym. We'll announce the official date as soon as it's fixed. I'm sure you've all heard the rumours. For all of you who train here... I'm truly sorry. Your two coaches have been trying hard to increase our membership and looking for a new location. They've been working really hard. Matsumoto and Hayashi. Once again, I thank you. For those of you with fights scheduled, of course we'll keep going until the end. Please carry on working with these two. That's all. Thank you very much. Back to work! Let's do it! The chairman just officially announced that the gym will close I'll work with you for your next match What are you so annoyed about? I'm not. Don't think you can read my mind. Talk to me. Talking won't solve it. But could talking make you feel better? Talking doesn't make a person less alone. Not everyone is as strong as you, Sis. I'm not really strong either. Yes, okay! Nice punch. Very good. Nice punch. And the last 30! Don't lower your shoulders. Keep them like that. - Are you in pain? - No. Keiko. Boxing... isn't something you can do without the will to fight. If you lose the will to fight, it's disrespectful to your opponent. And it's dangerous. Do you understand what I'm saying, Keiko? I didn't hear that. Tell me again, louder. Yes. Keiko, I'm sorry. About the gym closing. Your next fight... If you don't want to go ahead with it, it would be better to say so now. Think it over. See you. How are you? Is there anything you want me to send you? No, thanks I'll be back in Tokyo for your next fight Yes, she's deaf, but it's not a problem. No, no. She's already turned pro and has won two fights. Could we meet and talk about it? I see. No, not at all. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. Yes. Hello. It's Hayashi, of Arakawa gym. It's been a while. Yes. We're closing the gym at the end of the month. I'm phoning you about one of our members. I'll hand you over to the chairman. - It's Ms Goto. - Okay. Hello. It's been a while. I'm fine. And you? Look at that, amazing! Yes, a nice high ceiling. Boss, are you leaving now? - Shall I come with you? - No. I've called for a taxi. Don't worry. Thank you for taking this time to talk to them. See you, then. - Thanks. - Take care. Thank you very much. Please. How do you do? I'm really pleased to meet you. I've only just started learning it. But, today, is it okay if I talk to you using this? I watched the video of your last fight. You have a powerful punch. You're really strong. You came so close to a knock-out. How do you give her instructions during the fight? We've established a few signs. Does she have time? That's the problem, but there's not much we can do about that. It's still amazing. You don't need to hear instructions to win. We would like to welcome you to our gym. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. "It's difficult." What do you mean? It's a long way from where I live What are you talking about? Are you serious? The chairman bent over backwards to arrange this. After your next fight, take your time to think about it. Want to get something to eat? I'm disappointed in you. Matsumoto! Dear Chairman, I would like to take a break. Or I'll cause you all a lot of trouble. I was very happy to become a professional. Thank you very much. Arakawa Boxing Gym She'll tell me off again! Okay. The chairman has collapsed. He's in hospital as a precaution. I've been expecting this day to come, but all the same... it's been a shock. They showed me the x-rays. There's a new shadow in his skull. It's so tiny, though, that I couldn't even see it. His small blood vessels have narrowed a lot. If he's not treated, apparently the bigger blood vessels will end up narrowing too. So he's in hospital. And even if it takes a while, they said that with the right treatment he may avoid the worst. He always pulls through all right, doesn't he? That'll surprise the doctors, won't it? Keiko. Hurry up and get changed. Hello. Takaya, help me clean up out the front. Your next fight is soon, isn't it? We're looking forward to it. Yes. Give me a minute. Let's go! Okay, then. Let's do it once more. Go! One, two. Nice. My name is Hana. I taught her. Sorry, I'm not very good at it. She said: "Sorry, I'm not very good at it." She says you have beautiful hands. How do I say "thank you"? I've showed you that. No, the other way. You go up. Thank you very much. That's right. How is your knee now? Much better, thank you. I feel a lot better after the operation. Is that right? Hello. Do you go for walks? Yes. You told me I should walk, so I've made it part of my routine to go for a walk every morning. Yes. Thank you very much. Keiko. Thank you. Amazing! Can I have a look? Yes. Thanks. December 25. Roadwork, 10km. The river was very smelly today I nearly went home, but halfway through I got used to it. Mitts with the chairman at the gym.
