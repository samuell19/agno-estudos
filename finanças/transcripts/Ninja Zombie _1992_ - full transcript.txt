[dramatic music] - Goddamn car, goddamn fucking car! I'll be lucky if I can get out of here with a full wallet and a cheery ass. [cat meows] Where the hell's the bus stop? Oh. Great! Oh my god. Have I got money? [dramatic music] What? What? Come back, you son of a bitch! I hope you get hemorrhoids the size of golf balls! Asshole! [children shouting] [cat meows] [dog barking] Oh god. I'd give my soul for a way outta here! [groans] Shit! Great, what else can happen to me? Hey, who are you, what are you doing? - Quiet! - Shut up, man. - Get his wallet. - Fine then. - Give us your money, man, or we'll fuck you up good. [groaning] - It's in my wallet. I must have dropped it when I fell. - [Man] That's bullshit. Give it up or you're hamburger. - Come on, man, let's cut him up. Make him all pretty for the funeral. - What do you think, man, closed coffin? - [Man] If you prefer. After all, it's your funeral. - You're dead. [weapons clattering] - Children. - Thank you. My name is-- - I know who you are. Assistant Professor Orlan Sands. - I owe you my life. - [Man] It's a debt I intend to collect. [calm music] - [sighs] There's just something about rushing water. - Do you have to go to the bathroom? - No, dummy. It's peaceful and safe. Like an angel protecting you with wings of crystal. Kinda like being back in the womb, I guess. - You get all that from being on a rowboat? - Bozo, it's kinda romantic, don't you think? Or dontcha? - Uh huh, just for that, you don't get this. - Jack, what is it? - Well, as long as I'm a bozo, you'll never find out. [laughs] Say you're sorry and I'll give it to you. - Okay, I'm... Not sorry! [laughs] Take that! - Oh, have mercy. Uncle, uncle! - Ha! New title holder, undefeated. [Jack claps] Oh, Jack. They're beautiful. Why two? [laughs] [crying] For how long? - Always. [kissing] [laughs] - First, we'll call your mother. No, wait, we better call mine or she'll never forgive us. Oh, and we've got to get our pictures taken for the newspapers. - Yes. - And we'll have to make announcements made up. Oh, we'll have to get a good caterer. Oh, and of course we're gonna have to have it videotaped. Colors! What colors do you see for us, Jack? - Colors, colors. Blue and white. - Oh, blue and white, get outta here. I was thinking more along the lines of indigo and cream. - [laughs] What's indigo and cream? - Blue and white. - Blue and white. [laughs] I don't care if I have to marry you in polka dots, leopard skin. You know why? - No. - Well, if you don't, maybe I better not marry you. [laughs] [ominous music] Orlan, your timing. - I have to talk to you. [Jack sighs] The guy scares me, Jack. Big time. - Has he made contact since? - [Orlan] This came three days ago after that night. [sighs] - It's the Red Spider cult. I've heard of it. Very nasty characters. A nightmare anthology, my friend. Did you call the cops? - I was too scared. Besides, I drove by the next day after I picked up my car and the bodies were gone. - What do you think it's all about? - I don't know. If he wanted to eliminate me as a witness to the two killings, he could've done it then. - And this note's been the only contact he's made since? - Yeah, except that... I know this sounds paranoid, but I'd swear that someone went through my desk at the museum. The drawer wasn't broken but there were scratches all around the lock. - What could they be looking for? - I don't know. I don't answer the telephone anymore. I'm afraid to go home! Look. - Is that thing loaded? [laughs] Give me that. - You know I gotta be desperate if I'm hauling around one of these. - You're gonna need it. Someday you're gonna wake up with a crowd around you and I'm not gonna be there to save you. - What am I gonna do? - [sighs] What's the guy's name? [dramatic music] - Shit! - Spithrachne summons you. - Get your paw off my friend. You can tell Spittoon he's busy. [smacks] [water splashes] [grunts] [smacking] [nunchucks whooshing] [smacking] [water splashing] - Master? - I like your style. [Jack screaming] Too bad it's outdated. [water splashing] - Master? Master, please accept my apology. I fought hard in your name but I did not know he was ninja. - Of course, my First Leg. You've always been my favorite. [First Leg screaming] I forgive you. [gun firing] [sighs] Your manners are atrocious. Soon we must talk. [dramatic music] - Maggie. Maggie, wait. I didn't get a chance to talk to you inside. How are you holding up? Are you okay? - I just saw the man I love more than anything in the world lying in a hard wooden box. His skin was cold and they had his hair parted wrong. Jack's dead, Orlan! Jack's dead and I'm alone! - It'll pass, Maggie, trust me. - How? How can it, when he's in every thought I have, every place I see? - You should savor the memories. - Memories are all I have left! And this. This and his stupid motorcycle parked in my garage! - [Orlan] Maggie. - It's your fault, Orlan. You got him killed. It should've been you in there! - I could be next, Maggie. [ball bouncing] - Yeah! - Excuse me. I'm trying to find a guy named Brother Banjo. - We're in the middle of a game. - It's really important. - Deciding point. - Look, can you help me or not? - Will you shut up? - Come on, man, miss it! Loser buys beer! - This is an emergency. - Where is it? Where is it? I don't see it anywhere. It's disappeared. - I win. See you at the bar. How much money you got? - What? - How much? - 60, $70. - Come on, give it to me. Come on, you gotta make it worth my while. This guy's really creepy with his ravens' feathers and voodoo grease paint. [dramatic music] - [Orlan] What are you doing? - Shh. He's coming. Close your eyes. Do it. Count to five and then open 'em. - One, two, three, four, five. What's going on here? Where's Brother Banjo? - At your service. - You? - [laughs] What were you expecting, ravens' feathers and voodoo grease paint? [upbeat music] - That's it. That's everything. Can you help me? - Sure. All problems solved, remember? Damn. [snaps] What you need's a bodyguard. You need someone who can chew glass and then smile at you. - Jack was like that. - Perfect. - But I told you he's dead. - Look, look. Nothing gives a guy an edge like a little death, okay? So this dude's gonna be one major badass. - I don't understand how you can-- - Look, are you in it or not? - Okay. - Great. Then let's go raise some hell. [ominous music] Knock knock, hello there, anybody home? [laughs] Okay, crack it. [laughs] Let's get him out. Watch your, get off. Move over. Watch your step right there. Here. Right here. Well, he's a good guy, right? So he's gotta be next to a cross. And he's gotta be facing east. Don't ask me why. Bad duds. - Well, what now? - You got the ring? Put it on. Put it on. As long as he wears the ring, whoever possesses that one controls him. You've got it, so you're in charge. Now say the words I taught you and let's get this show on the road. No! Come on. [speaking in foreign language] - What'd I do wrong? Damn it, I can't believe I fell for that! [speaking in foreign language] What a crock of horseshit. If Professor Couver-- [screams] I control you. You can't hurt me. You've gotta do what I say. Good. Good, good boy, Jack, stay. Stay. Gotta say, you don't look very threatening in that suit. Now let's get you dressed. Badass. Let's see that again. Up there. [dramatic music] Something fancier. [thuds] Oh god. And you're gonna protect me from Spithrachne's men? [ominous music] Get 'em! [smacking] - Go get him. - Oh, no. - Go get him. - I'm not gonna get him, you get him. [screaming] [groans] [grunting] [smacking] - The Red Spider cult has asserted your name, master. - Greetings, Mr. Sands. I'm sorry we couldn't speak sooner but you're a very difficult man to get ahold of. - Bastard! What do you want? - Stop! You must remember, Mr. Sands is our guest. [smacks] Much better. What I want, Mr. Sands, is something only you can give me. No doubt you've heard of the Urn of Prometheus? - The urn? But that's what the... - Yes. That's what your friend Professor Couver is looking for, isn't it? I know he's on an archeological expedition seeking the urn. I also know that once he finds it and brings it back, it will be under heavy security and virtually impossible to acquire. So what I'd like to know is where is the excavation taking place? [ominous music] Now, Mr. Sands, I hope you will be more productive than you have been. I really dislike having to use this. Well, that's not altogether true. But it would save you a great deal of bodily fluids to just cooperate. - Why do you want the urn? It has no real monetary value. What possible use do you have for it? - That, Mr. Sands, must remain my secret for now. I weary of this. You are loyal, Mr. Sands. May I call you Orlan? Well, I suppose Mr. Sands is more appropriate under the circumstances. Where's my Second Leg? - He was killed in the cemetery, master. By one of the undead. - Really? I applaud your resourcefulness, Mr. Sands. I sometimes dabble in the gray arts myself. Tell me, what do you use to control the zombibi? Very well, Mr. Sands. I must admit I didn't really expect you to answer. This quality of loyalty is very strong in you, Mr. Sands. I believe, however, I may have a remedy for that. I hope you like eggs, Mr. Sands. My friends the red spiders make these especially for me. They have rather unique quality, as you shall soon see. I made a rhyme. Over the teeth, over the gums, look out stomach, here it comes! [Orlan groaning] Now, you control your undead servant and I control you. A tidy arrangement, don't you think? Now, this is my plan. If you have any input, just keep it to yourself. [calm music] [Maggie screams] [gasps] - [Maggie] Oh, Orlan. - Hey, Maggie, it's okay, don't cry. - Did you see? Did you see what they did to Jack? - [Orlan] What do you mean? - Someone's dug him up. Someone's taken Jack's body! Who would have done that? I don't understand. - It'll be all right, Maggie. Let me take you home and I'll call the police and report it. Don't worry, they'll find him. - Orlan, look. - At what? - Someone's coming. Maybe he knows something. - [Orlan] I don't think so, Maggie. He's probably just looking for someone's grave. - Yeah, but maybe he knows something. Excuse me, excuse me! - Look, he probably just can't find his car or something, that's all. - I just want to ask him if he knows something. He might know everything. - I'm sure he doesn't. I don't think he's gonna come any closer. Looks to me like he's going to stop! I bet he was just looking for that crypt. Any minute now, he'll probably go inside! [door creaking] Let me take you home. - I'm glad you called, Orlan. There's been great progress. - I'm all ears, Professor Couver. - You're gonna be all smiles when you see what I'm bringing back. - [Orlan] Then it's real? You found it? - You bet your associate degree. It was right where I knew it'd be. The Urn of Prometheus. Yeehaw! - [Orlan] That's great. - I knew you'd be excited. - [Orlan] Has anything happened? - [laughs] You mean that business about the urn possessing supernatural powers? Nah, not a peep. Well, not that I'd know how to work it anyway. Didn't come with instructions. - When are you bringing it back? - Well, we should be back, we have to leave at dawn tomorrow to meet the security team at 6:00 a.m. So I should-- Hello, Orlan? Huh. [phone ringing] [dramatic music] [Orlan groaning] - Yes, master, I'm listening. - You said always. [crashes] [Maggie crying] [clattering] - If you're going to be of any use to me, you've gotta fight better than you did yesterday. Probably just need to crack the rigor mortis out of those joints. Here. Now show me what you can do with this. Show me a thrust. Pathetic. Try again. [stick clatters] What is the matter with you? You were doing better than this yesterday. I wonder what Maggie ever saw in you. Okay, tough guy. Let's see what you can do. [upbeat music] ♪ Behave yourself ♪ ♪ Behave yourself ♪ - Let's see how good your aim is. Hey, careful with that! Now let's see if you can hit those bottles I've set up. [gun firing] NRA poster child. [Jack growls] [bottles smashing] Touche. Just in time too. Let's go. [screaming] - Help, I'm being attacked! - What the hell? [guns firing] [smacking] - My god, there's no blood. - [Orlan] Let go of him! - Orlan, you. Why are you doing this? - Go for the urn! Professor, I'm sorry. I can't tell you the reason for this. I can only-- [pottery shattering] What are you doing? Give me that. Now bring me the urn! [smacking] - Orlan, stop this! - I'm sorry, Professor. I must have the urn. But don't worry, nothing will happen to you. - Forget about me! What about the urn? If it does possess mystic powers, you can't just drop it into the wrong hands! - No! - The Red Spiders have been successful. - We should leave before we're discovered. - No! You can't have this. I'm not going to give it to him. [groaning] Get them. Kill them. [smacking] [bone snaps] [smacking] [bodies thud] Jack! It's the spider eggs. Spithrachne made me swallow them. I've got to get them out of my stomach. Help me. Wait a minute. What are you doing? [gagging] God, shit! You may not be able to understand, but thank you. I don't know what this thing does but we can't let Spithrachne have it. I've got to hide it somewhere. Wait, I've got it. You hide it. And don't let me know where it is. That way, it's sure to be safe. - What? - The Red Spiders have succeeded in your name, master. We retrieved the urn but it was stolen from us. - Who would dare? - It was your servant, Sands. And his creature. [Spithrachne screams] - So he has shrugged off my control. I have other means to subjugate him. [bell ringing] [dramatic music] You, my Eighth Leg, are my last hope. You have never failed me. Bring Mr. Sands to me. If he resists, feel free to hurt him. One more thing. Make sure he resists. Hope I haven't kept you waiting. - A half hour, but it's your money, so what the hell? And speaking of which. - [Spithrachne] Oh! How foolish of me. I trust that's sufficient? - Sufficient? Honey, I'm yours, bought and paid for. - [Spithrachne] How nice. - Is this what you want? You're really getting me hot, baby. That tattoo is really turning me on. Take me, Spiderman. [flesh squelching] [screaming] [calm music] - How are you feeling? - Better. Although I'd give anything to know what happened. I mean, why was his grave filled in the next day? Who could have done it? Why would anybody-- - Shh. Let's not get started again. - You're right. Would you pass me the jam? Thank you. I still love him. - You've gotta go on, Maggie. - Do you miss him? - Well, Maggie, sometimes I feel like he's never left. - [Maggie] I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like he's standing right behind me. - Men's room! - [Maggie] What? - Uh, I've gotta go to the men's room. [water running] [dramatic music] [Orlan groaning] Jack! Help me! [smacking] And you can tell Spiderpuss that the next time one of you goons attacks me, I'll destroy the urn. I'm not kidding. Now beat it! - You're sure you saw him control the zombibi with this? And the woman was unaware of its presence and yours? Mr. Sands has been full of surprises throughout this little undertaking. I would be remiss if I did not return the favor. Can't have him thinking me to be unimaginative, can we? Cracker Jack prize. Doesn't do a thing for me. Now, this is what we must do. - [Orlan] Like my new car? - A lot better than your old one. I had a nice time, Orlan, we should do this more often. - [Orlan] Yeah, it was fun. - I want to apologize about that day. I shouldn't have said those things. - It's okay, I know, you'll get over it. - I don't wanna get over it! Look, I know I have to, it's just... It's just that sometimes I feel like he's right behind me, like I could just reach out and touch him. - I miss him too, Maggie, but now, look, he's gone and there's only us. [ominous music] We've gotta keep going. He'd want us to. He'd want us to keep going together. - Orlan, don't! I still love him. [engine revving] [Jack screaming] - [sighs] Oh, it's you. Get over there and help me, will you? I can't imagine where that damn ring's gone to. It's gotta be around here somewhere. Hey, watch out what you're doing, will ya? Hey, spread out, get busy. You know what you're supposed to do. It's not in there. [groans] The hell do you think you're-- [fist smacks] I get the message. - Fine, my undead friend, wonderful! You have performed well. However, I have no further need of you, so you may go on to your just reward now by [sighs], let's see, take a long walk off a short pier. [water splashing] Mr. Sands! It's so nice to see you again. I'm extremely pleased you could be here on this very special occasion. - What special occasion? - It's my birthday! - Birthday? - Yeah, and I'm so happy you could be here. After all, you're like one of the family. - You should've said something. I didn't get you a gift. I'll just run down to K-Mart, I'll only be gone a second. - The thought is appreciated but you already have my gift. Where is the Urn of Prometheus? [dramatic music] You know, you're the first person I've ever let sit in this chair. An extremely rare privilege but I don't know, you're kinda special. Oh, don't fret, plenty more where that came from. In fact, maybe I'll put one on for every year. It is my birthday. - [Orlan] How old are you? [Spithrachne mimics mumbling] - [laughs] 317. [Orlan screams] Will you tell me where the urn is? [Orlan sighs] - Untie my hands. - Where is the urn? - Untie my hands and I'll tell you. - Tell me and I'll untie your hands. - No, you won't. - You're probably right. All right, I'll untie them. But fuck with me, it's lights out. See, you've made me so upset I said the F word. Untie this. - Hurry up! Please. [groaning] - Now, for the last time, where is the urn? - I don't have it anymore. I gave it to someone. - [Spithrachne] Who? - Jack. - [Spithrachne] The zombibi? - Zombie, yeah. - I don't believe you. - [Orlan] It's true. - You know, it's really irritating to be thought of as a fool. You knew I control the zombibi. Why would you have given it the urn when it would have been child's play for me to retrieve it from him? - Gave it to him before you got the ring. - I see. What did he do with it? - I don't know, I told him to hide it someplace secret, someplace where I couldn't see it. - So only the undead man knows where it is, huh? Victory is finally close. I shall lure the zombibi here, and it will bring me the Urn of Prometheus, and I shall be whole once more! The knowledge and powers I possess, humans will fall one by one under my control until the entire race acknowledges me as its supreme being! [grunting] [ring clatters] You have just sealed your fate. [ominous music] [Maggie screams] - Boo. - [Orlan] You bastard! - [Spithrachne] Sticks and stones, Mr. Sands. - If I had a stick, I'd shove it up your ass. - I'll let you loose if you'd like to try. No? Pity. [nunchucks whooshing] Sure you won't change your mind? Now, I will find the ring and order your dead friend to bring me the urn. - It won't work. - Why not? - I commanded him to bring it only to me. He won't obey your order. - Then you order him to bring it here. - No. Forget it. - Shall I have to force you, Mr. Sands? - Go ahead, just try. I can take anything you could dish out. - [laughs] You're a walking cliche, Mr. Sands. And consequently boring as hell. I wasn't referring to you at all. [bell ringing] - Maggie! - Orlan? - I see you two know each other. Splendid. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Spithrachne, leader of the Red Spider cult. This fellow who escorted you here, rather roughly I admit, is the last surviving member of my team of assassins. And this is a red hot poker. I'm sure we'll all have a wonderful time. - We're gonna have an absolutely wonderful time here, Helen. - Oh, yes. Lots of sunshine, lots of nature. And just smell that wonderful air. [sighs] - But I don't know why you had to bring that thing with you. - I told you I wanted to watch the movie. Oh, that reminds me. [ominous music] - I think they should make October 21st the day the time changes. - What are you talking about? - Well, look, it's eight o'clock and it's dark already. - October 21st is the day the time changes. Why don't you try taking your sunglasses off? - Oh. - You know, we drive three hours, three hours to get out here to stand on someone's grave. To stand there and say we remember. I mean, I don't even remember what Father looks like. - We're out here to see Mother. - Mother's alive. - So is Father. - Oh. - Look, why don't we just get out and do this? - Do you have any of that candy left? - We didn't bring any candy. - Be that way. - I'm getting too old for these kind of shows. They make me nervous. - Oh, shut up and hand me a cold one. [Orlan screaming] - Stop it! Stop it, stop it! - I'd love to, my dear, but he refuses to help me with my problem. You don't think I actually enjoy this sort of thing, do you? [Orlan screams] [Maggie screams] Could put an end to his suffering, my dear, if only you could convince him to help me. - Orlan. Orlan, whatever it is he wants you to do, please do it. - Well? [laughs] I really appreciate your stamina. One rarely finds such a quality. [Orlan screams] Where is the urn? I want the urn. Give me the goddamn urn! [slow music] - Please. Jack! Somebody please help us! [water splashing] - Give it to me. Now give it to me, you bitch! - No! Jack! - Your lover's dead. I killed him. I'm sorry, but nothing can save you now. Put it on. - No. - Put it on and order your dead friend to bring me the urn. - I don't care if you hurt me anymore. I won't do it. - I think it's time to take a new approach. - [Woman] How you can watch these things. - [Woman] I can't with you talking. - [Woman] But the whole concept is ridiculous. Dead people coming back alive? - [Woman] Oh, shh. - [Johnny] This place is the really scary bit. - [Bobby] Stop it, Johnny. - [Johnny] You're still scared, aren't you? - [Bobby] You're so ignorant. - [Johnny] They're coming to get you, Bobby. They're coming to get you. Look, there's one of 'em this very minute. - [Bobby] You're being childish. - [Johnny] He's dark, grizzly, just like a Republican. I'm getting out of here. - [Bobby] Johnny! - [Narrator] We'll return to Night of the Raging Dead after these messages. [scary music] [women screaming] - [Spithrachne] Last chance. - Do your worst. - I intend to. [motorcycle rumbling] - Wait. Wait a minute. Okay. You win. I'll do whatever you want. - Too late! It's playtime. - Stop. You son of a bitch. Don't you touch her! - I hope you fry in hell. - I don't burn easily. [motorcycle rumbling] What the fuck is that? [dramatic music] - Jack. - Jack? [bangs] [Spithrachne screams] - Stop! Where is the Urn of Prometheus? [squelching] Worthless pottery. But fill it with water and drink from it and dead flesh renews. Pick up that gun. This is a wonderful moment for me. The urn, its power, and a slave who will obey my every command. Time to sever the ties that bind. Shoot the woman. - Jack, it's me, Maggie. It's Maggie, Jack. Don't you recognize me? - Obey me. Shoot her. Do as I say, shoot her! Shoot her. Shoot her, shoot her! - I love you, Jack. - Goddamn you. I control you. Kill her! Kill her! - Always. [clatters] [spits] - You fucker. Let's see if you can survive being sliced into 1,000 ribbons. [dramatic music] [swords clashing] [Jack screaming] [fists smacking] [swords clashing] [flesh squelching] - What the? He's a zombie too. [Spithrachne crying] - Jack? I knew. Somehow I just knew. Jack, I-- [shouts] I never stopped loving you. Don't ever stop loving me. - Jack! Jack, the urn. Jack, stop Spithrachne from reaching the urn. - You're too late. [laughs] The power's mine! [gun clatters] - Jack, pick up the gun. Pick up the gun, Jack. - Fool! You destroy the only thing that could bring her back to life? - Jack, you can't let him use the urn. - Not just her. Yourself too. Your skin could be warm again, her lips moist once more. You could lead normal lives, be human beings again! Only follow me. [gun fires] [water dripping] - Look at his hand. - It's alive. My hand is alive! I can actually feel the urn, the smooth clay in my palm. Cool water dripping from my fingers. I can feel. I can feel. [screams] Pain! Like fire burning through my wrist! My hand's alive but my arm is still dead! Oh, living flesh cannot coexist with death [mumbles]. [screaming] [fire crackling] - Revenge. - Jack. Jack! [calm music] - Always. [dramatic music] - I had this dream. I died. It wasn't a dream, was it? - Hey, Jack. Hey. You think you could get me outta here? Jack, hey! Could somebody let me loose?
