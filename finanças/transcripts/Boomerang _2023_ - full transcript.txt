It's nowhere. Where is it? Look everywhere. Anybody there? No one is there. Is the bag yours? - Yes. - Then, take it. Shall we escape? This is a number lock. My phone is missing. Phone...? Where did you keep it? Shucks! Where the hell is it? My phone is missing too. Sir! Boomerang: Film Title. Why are they in such a hurry? [S.K. LADIES HOSTEL] Is this an advertisement of the ladies hostel? What? See a guy ironing so sincerely. Get lost, man. Don't make me wait for a long time. She isn't seen anywhere outside, dear. She never gets out on time. Bro, please buy a ticket from me. Please... I don't want it. Take one ticket. This is Karunya Plus, you will win. That guy is killing time. Go and ask him. Dammit! - Bro. - Yes. - Won't you buy a ticket from me? - I don't want it. - This is Karunya Plus. - No, need, bro. You will win the lottery for sure. I don't hope so. This way, you will get thrashed very soon. He's stalking girls. Both of them... Hey. Today's duty is over, right? Let's go. I'm leaving. Why are you late? Rony, that's a long story. What happened? I found my stomach growling when I reached here. So, I returned home, pooped and came back. That's why I'm late. No toilets anywhere around? Don't you know I'm allergic to public toilets? Why do you make fun of me, Ronny? Rony, It's on my own risk that I availed the loan for you. Please pay the interest, at least. The Chairman had mentioned about it even yesterday. Dear... Please wait until my marriage. Then, I'll settle the entire loan. Wait until then. Okay. Okay. Good morning, Sir. Yes, come on. In this segment... The second draft... What is this 20,000 all about? That is gawking wages. (Wages for just looking on) Don't mention this, okay? Okay, Sir. Rony. I've already mentioned it. What? What have you mentioned? Nothing, Sir. I was talking about my bank. My bank is providing unique offers. - Really? - Yes. Moreover, If you deposit a bulk amount in our bank, there are many offers other than interest. Tell me more about those offers. Pattaya. Thailand. The message they give is awesome. Just hearing about it will give you goosebumps, right? Get up, you fool. I bet you want to make my nude pictures viral. People barge in just to waste other's time. My normal isn't his normal. My bad. What's up, honey? Are you busy, Rony? Terribly busy. But, I can spare some time for you. You must be busy after marriage too. Let me just remind you about the day after tomorrow. Dear Ancy, let us think about the upcoming events later. - Yes, but... - I won't forget it. I'll be there without fail. Just a minute. A client of mine is calling. I'll call you back. Okay. Kalyani. When's your hubby leaving? What? On 10th? That's enough. I'll also be free only by 10th. Then, let's enjoy together. Okay? That's set. Now, let me try this. Excuse me. How much does this car cost? 25 lakhs. 25 lakhs is too pricey. No. Any scope for discount? - Sorry. - No? Anyway, both of 3 looks very... pretty. - I'm leaving, bye. - Bye. Jumped right in front of them. Come on. Don't mind them. Just run. Do you see the fish? - It's really huge. - Is it fresh? Yes, look at this. Do you want me to cut it for you? No, my wife will do it. If your wife is an expert, I don't want to cut it. Let me pack it for you. Please come. Come closer. See the Indian Mackerels. Both Indian Mackerels and Tuna are there. Get Tuna. The fish are from Vypin, and not from outside. Please come near. Come on. This is Tuna. It's really fresh. 350. Is it priced high? Indian Mackerel and Tuna are there. Come on. How much does Tuna costs? I've sent the photos on What's app. Look into it, and tell me which fish you need. Google pay will do. Have a look at the fish. The fish is fresh from the sea. Indian Mackerels are there. Come on, Sir. Come here, Sir. What do you want, Sir? Will you give me anything I ask for? Yes, according to the availability. You must keep your promise. Buy some fish instead of sweet talking with me. My favourite fish is not there on your plate. Sir, don't talk in an embarrassing tone. There's only one fish that I don't have. That's a blue whale. What can I do if you are ignorant about fish varieties? Do you know how many varieties of fish are there in the sea? Is it you who dwells in a car knows better about fish than me who lives on the coast? Fresh fish, come on. Come here. Jesus! What if 'yes'? If so, can you tell the names of fish as much as I say? What if I can tell double the names of fish than you? Maria... Sisily... Sir says that he can say more number of fish names than us. He's challenging Us, funny! Ask him what he will give in return for playing the game. What will you give, if I win? 2000 rupees. If I'm the one who wins, you must give this King Mackerel for free. I agree. - Let's start. - Yes. Indian Mackerel, Sardine, Silver pomfret... [Names of fish] [Names of fish] [Names of fish] Oh, my God. [Names of fish] Dileesh Pothan [Film Director's name] Maria, Lilly has surrendered, I guess. Yes, of course. He defeated her in the game. He is awesome. - Tea for you. - No, thanks. Hey, just come here. What's the matter, Sir? Who is Gireesh Attingal? There he is. This job doesn't suit me. - Is it him? - Yes, Sir. This is going to rock. Sir. Yes. I'm S.I. Jayadevan. Purushothaman Sir asked me to come here. Is that you? - Have you arranged his costume? - Yes, Sir... Give it to him. Sir, please go near the costume vehicle. Your costume has been kept ready. - Is it over there? - Yes. The pregnant widow. This won't work out. - Sir, one doubt. - Okay, ask. I... I've got a wig that will suit my character. Can I wear it if possible? That's not needed. Please get going. - Costumes are there, right? - Yes. Suresh, what do I do with such dumb fellows? Insane, that's all. Place the camera in this position. Output will be good. Sir, What shall I do...? Call the hero and the other guy. Listen carefully. Keep the mobile away. You are asking for a cup of tea to the tea shop owner. And the shot... Is he entering from this side or that side? I called him, and he's already here. He comes in, and asks for tea. Listen to what I'm saying. So, do as I said. So, we are going to take a mid-shot. Camera ready? Okay, ready. Sir... sir... When I'm giving him tea, what should be my facial expression? How many expressions do you know? Do you know any 7 expressions out of Navarasas, by heart? No. Action. [Angrily] A cup of tea. Enjoy and drink it. Cut it. Guess you have experience in drinking tea. Good, anyway. Our next scene is... Yes, Sir... - Sir... - Don't pinch me, let me shoot it. Sir... I just want to know how many scenes do I have. I must go for my duty after this. Sir, your... This is the biggest scene in your life. Nothing gets into your head easily. Heck with such guys. Get ready for the next shot. I wonder why all the trash in the world falls on my head. - Sir. - Take the vehicle. I saw you acting. Your face was rich with emotions. Don't try to butter me. Who's on watchman duty at our station? It's Aneesh. He's not very alert. Yes, Sir. He lacks alertness. If so, you may watch the station today onwards. You are super alert, right? Sir... Look straight and drive. ♪ If anybody watches Achayan drink dry toddy. ♪ ♪ Wearing a silk cloth. ♪ ♪ If anybody watches Achayan drink dry toddy. ♪ ♪ Wearing a silk cloth. ♪ ♪ Every woman gets lured by his charm. ♪ ♪ Every man gets a cold feet. ♪ ♪ Even if the one sitting nearby blackout, ♪ ♪ He opens the next bottle, and drinks. ♪ ♪ Even if the one sitting nearby blackout, ♪ ♪ He opens the next bottle, and drinks. ♪ ♪ He get sloshed, step by step. ♪ ♪ And enjoys small talking with others. ♪ - Gopalancheta... - What's it? Does the fish cost 3000 rupees? No way. Only God knows if it costs 300 or 3000. It's Achayan who is saying it. Arun, you were talking about this Mahesh's marriage, right? Yes, Achaya. On 10 Th of this month. Do you have any previous experience? No, I'm a little tense about it. How old is the girl? Just passed her degree. Mahesh, Mahesh, Have you read about Osho? - No. - Gopalanchetaa... What's it, dear? How is Oshko related to marriage? How's Sunny Leone and marriage related to each other? Oshko has the same relationship with marriage. Sex. Sex is just a sweet for a person who have experienced it. But it's heaven for a person who has not experienced it. Got it? I got it. You will get from me today. Do you understand, Mahesh? Somewhat. That's all. When sex is involved in a relationship, it becomes an attachment. When it goes beyond a particular stage, it is liberation. Wow! Sex is a blissful state of being like meditation. No, I didn't get any fish. What's up there? Tell me. Is it true? She is getting married? Shobhana, give me rice. Is she big enough to get married? Has she completed her studies? When my cousins went for a trip, they sent me photos and videos of their trip. That's the only way I can see places. What else could I do? It's been long since I attended a marriage function back in my hometown. Now she will bring bitter gourd upperi and tomato pulissery. Yeah, our daughter is going to school as well. Yes, I'm coming next week. Meet you soon. Okay, then. Superb acting. Either a tea shop owner, or a beggar. Otherwise, a policeman as you have a uniform. You won't get any other role other than this. Even if you get a role, does any expression come on your face? Those giving you roles have to be thrashed. Do your job properly, first. As your father died when he was in the service, you landed this job, at least. Otherwise, you could roam around jobless. The dialogue that the broker rascal told me during our marriage... An SI in Kochi is like a king, it seems. Money will flow in, it seems. But nothing flowed in so far. Police, these days, don't even have the ability to keep their balls safe. Mom, rice for me too. Yeah, I will give you. Dad, is it because grandpa died that you landed this job? Yes. So, if you die, will I land a job too? Yes, you will land a job. If he remains the same as this, you will become an SI, and I'll go to jail too. Is it true, dad? Eat. Stop. Hello, Aren't you Mr.Kuriakose? Yes. I'm the S.I. of Kundanoor police station. What's the matter? Haven't you applied for a gun license? Yes, I've applied for one. I'd like you meet you in person. I have some personal queries. I'm not free right now. I'm selecting models for my advertising company. I mean, audition. My agency is doing the advertisement of Jodi matrimonial. The audition is for the same. Okay, Sir. Let's meet at Sheraton in the evening. Okay? Meet you in the evening at Sheraton. Start. Looks like cranes walking on the ridges. Jesus! There is not even a single girl who looks good. Just wasted my money. Director, She is the gem I've been searching for. This fatty girl? Yes. What about our concept? Concept? Heck with your concept. ''A handsome guy for a fatty girl''. That must be our concept. Hi, Achayan. Hey, Nancy, Rinku... Welcome to Ooty. Nice to meet you. Thank you. - How are you guys? - Fine. - Good. - And what about you? I'm fine, very fine. - Okay, carry on. - Bye. Bye, take care. S.I Jayadevan? Please sit. What's up? Where do you live? I'm a Trissur native. But now, I live here. What do you want to know about me as a part of the gun license inquiry? Although I've come for an inquiry relating to the license... Open up. I'd like to act in films or in commercials. If you could help me... That's all? At first glance itself, I sensed your talent of acting. It's not good to discuss about such thing here. Let's go upstairs. - Upstairs? - Yes, come on. Pull the break gently. Is this the place? - Yes, of course, get down. - Who knows? So annoying! Hello, Sir... You can't park the bike over here. Valet parking, man. Is there valets for bikes too? All okay? Who do you want to impress over here? You are an utter failure in life. What's the use of going for the reunion? I'm not going for the reunion. Then? I'm going to meet Catherine. I will propose her today. No way! Tell something that is possible for you. I'm going to plan one of her dance shows in Kochi. Really? Will she be there? Of course! That's why I'm taking interest in it. I married her just because she looks like actress Shobana. My wife is not right. Why do you say so? She is not recognizing my talents. I didn't go for the audition of Bahubali just because she didn't allow me to go. If I'd made through the audition, I would've stood there holding a sphere behind Bhallaldev. She is not understanding my emotions. That's my problem. Very sadist. I haven't taken my glass. No need of a glass or a pot. Come with me. I can't drink other than from my glass. You sit here, dumbo. Let me get a tissue paper... Isn't this your problem? It will become clean once we wipe it off. Then, we will throw it in the waste basket. How do you drink from a glass used by random people in the bar? Moron, how are you going to liplock a girl after marriage? Hi. Thank you. What do you want to drink? Did you see him? Isn't it Johny Walker? No, I meant the one wearing a white shirt. - Where is he? - There he is. He's a rich guy. If you can take some effort and convince him, you will get huge funds. Huge funds? Yes, of course. But you won't be able to convince him all alone. He is a Casanova. Oh, really? So, this will workout. It depends. Depends... [Indistinct chattering] Dude, smells good rum. Where is she? Who knows? This is your last chance. My hands and legs are shivering. His singing is as terrible as always. Subair, nice singing. Bless you for being a great singer. Excuse me for a minute. Hey, Jerry, naughty chap. Hey. Long time, no see. Dude, where were you all these days? I was here around. Who is this fatty? He's my colleague, friend. Bro... I'm Balu. I've come to get sloshed at his cost. Where is the booze kept? Hey. There it is. - I have a doubt. - What's it? Is that guy singing or crying? - He's crying. - I thought so. Hello, Michael Jackson, quit and go. Hey, little frog. I hope you don't have any inferiority complex. Why should I have such a feeling? You needn't feel bad for not landing a good job. Chill, man. Get lost! Dog! If so, she will get into trouble. Ain't I right? No way. That's true. She has a friend in Travels. Just go and meet Liji. She will get the tickets confirmed. She is awesome. I also know Liji. It's a 4 days trip. One destination per day. That's how we have planned. That will be fun. Hi, Catherine. - Hi. - When did you reach? Just a while back. Tell Reshma. What else do you have to tell about my planning? That's definitely a good plan. That's the best for your career. - Really? - Yes. UK or USA? Which is better? UK is the best. So, that's your opinion too. I also prefer UK to USA. Guys born just to humiliate Men. Fix a drink for me. Dear Jayadevan, please wait for sometime. I can't wait any longer, Achaya. She is 10 years younger to me, Achaya. Do you know one thing? We haven't had any physical relationship for the past 1 year. I don't have any extra marital relationship either. Achaya. Hi Alan, what's happening? Just going on. He's Rony. Our company's marketing executive. - Hello, Rony. - Hi. Nice to meet you, Sir. Nice meeting you. He's Jayadevan, Kundanoor S.I. Hi, Sir. Ask him. Achaya, Rony wants to meet you personally. Why not? Normally, I don't give visiting cards to men. Anyway, let's talk for sometime. Thank you, bro. Okay, then, carry on. Carry on. We have some personal affairs to deal with. One straw, please. - Straw? - Yes, I need a straw. Forgive me. Oh, mood spoiler. Hello, tell me. Rony, come on time tomorrow. I know. No need of reminding it every now and then. Understand? I'm in an urgent meeting. Call you later. Is it Ancy? Yes. We have pre-marital counseling tomorrow. She is calling me often to remind me about it. It's your marriage, right? At least now, stop jumping over the fence. Why do girls build fences around? Isn't it why we are forced to jump over them? Look at this. Are you sleeping, baby? Are you alone? When you receive such messages, won't a guy jump over any fence, dude? I was wondering... How could she like a fraud like you? Sorry, dear. You continue... Like a fraud like me? I wonder how Ancy, being a rich girl likes you? That's a long story. I'll tell you. Once upon a time, in a lift... You yourself? Yes, I myself hit him. Do you think I'll get good girls from good families? Now then, I'll have to adjust with girls like these. How is she? She is the model who's going to act in my advertisement. How is she? Nice girl. I long to be pampered by a girl, Achaya. Jayadevan, Make the inquiry report favorable to me. When the license is okay, come to my flat. I have saved a gift for you. - Aren't you happy? - Yes. Your bald head is glowing. [Singing a song from the film, Pazhassi Raja] Spoiling the song from Marakkar. Rascal! Hey. Take a peg and propose Catherine. Isn't he a nice guy? Yes, he is. - Catherine. - Yes. Nothing. Didn't I tell you? I want to tell something to you. - You may tell. - Catherine. I don't have much time. There is a music show tomorrow. - Are you coming with me? - Yes, I'm. It's late. I haven't taken my vehicle.. - Leaving? - Yes, I am. See you. See you, bye. See you. Bye. Hey, Jerry. Like my music video, okay? His own mom wouldn't like it, let alone Jerry.

Show me your list. - Kuriakose. - Kuriakose! Must be an old fellow. Go. What if I meet Santra Jacob? Until yesterday, you were after Catherine. You are not matured enough to handle Santra Jacob. The thing is, I'm mentally prepared for another girl. I don't love Catherine anymore. Sorry, you may go and meet Kuriakose. Have a nice day. For what? I was saying it to myself. Have a nice day, Balu. Bye, Mari. Mari? Do you have another list? No? Bye. I've seen him somewhere. Who are you guys? Isn't he the S.I. Sir? Is he a cop? S.I. of Kundanoor station? By the way, who are you? Did his hair grow? Sir. Sir. Who are you guys? Aren't you the S.I. of Kundanoor station? Where are you getting ready to? What? What role are you acting today? Fish seller or beggar? Got the license. License? My friend's license has been sanctioned. You don't know him. Whatever it is, come to Athira at noon. Athira? For what? In Athira Gold and Silk. What for? Daughter and I are going to purchase some clothes. Next week is my sister's kid's naming ceremony. Forgot about it? Do one thing. Take the money, and... You can't escape from it by just giving money. They will give discount only if you are there. You must come with me. You may take my entire purse. Don't be over smart like Kerala Police. You must definitely come with me. Dear Lord Muthappa... When is he going to be responsible in life? Where are going in this civil dress? I'm going to borrow some money from the Home Minster. Coming with me? I'm getting ready for C.I.'s daughter's marriage. - Who are you? - I'm Rony. Sir, I'm innocent. Achayan asked us to come to the flat. Oh, the Earth is rotating. Is this the flat? No. 1. Okay. Who's there? No one. Bell. Kuriakose Sir? He's gone outside. He'd asked me to come here. He asked me to come, I swear. One minute. She must be his stepney for sure. Hello, Sir. I've reached, already. Wait inside? But Sir, I'm busy... Sir..., okay. Sir asked me to wait inside. No other person is as good as me in dealing with clients. How are you (Honey) related to Kuriakose Sir? I'm not related to him. That's good. Then, how did you reach here? That's me. I can be seen in flats that are not occupied. Naughty girl. Don't get angry at me. I'm asking it out of love. You seem to be very defensive, Honey. No, I'm very offensive. Counter! I like it. Did Achayan ask you here? I come invited or uninvited. So, you'd come invited or uninvited. Naughty girl. But I'm not a called girl. But, I didn't mean it. No, I didn't say so. One minute. What urgency does she have to call at this time? If I don't switch it off, she will irritate me. That was a client. A client. Hi dears... Love is not to be searched anywhere. When it comes to you unexpectedly, just enjoy the essence of it. Each moment is to be celebrated. Both Achayan and Osho believe in it. I liked the set up. Good, no? Do you like it? Shall I tell you something? Yes. I don't know Kuriakose. I don't know Kuriakose. Earlier, when I rang up Kuriakose Sir, my phone was switched off. I was just playing a card. When I saw you. So... Let's celebrate. Now? Yes. Love you, Jesus! Who are you? Is Kuriakose Sir inside? No, he has gone out. Mam, I'm from Used Premium Car Showroom. I'm here to meet Sir. What's this? What's up? Balu, I saw a beautiful girl. At Kuriakose Sir's flat. Really? Did you hit on her? No, dude. She looks like his daughter. She closed the door saying that he was not at home. If he's not there, go again and tell that he asked you to wait. You are a failure. That's shameful, no? If it is shameful, you may wait at Subhash Park. 2 new statues have been installed there. Let me butter Santra Jacob. Hang up the call. Santra Jacob? Yes, son, it's me. Didn't I tell you that Sir is not here? Sir? So, are you not his daughter? No. When I rang up Sir in the lobby downstairs, Balu asked me to wait inside. Balu? No. Kuriakose Sir. Sir wouldn't say so. Why should I tell lies, mam? I swear Sir asked me to wait inside. Did he say so? Okay then, get inside. Thank you. Can you give me some water? Shall I offer you some juice? Yes, that will do. My grandson is coming from Australia. If he has a car to play with, that will be fun. Good decision. Who's that? Your girl friend? San... Do you have discount schemes for senior citizens? I mean, a reduced price. For senior citizens. Discount scheme. Yes, we have one. Really? Wait a moment. This is a Benz car. This is BMW. What I want next is an OD. It's nice if you could give a discount. Are you running away when I say, OD? I'll ring you up. He ran away. Poor guy. Take it. Juice? This was easier. Hi dears... Life is to enjoy. Both Achayan and Osho believe in it. Enjoy each and every second of the life. I got scared. Why is the clock like this? That's just a set up over here. When will Sir come back? It's you spoke to Sir over the phone. Then, how will I know? Yes, yes, correct. My name's Jerry. What's your name? Honey. Honey. Nice name. You must be Sir's relative. Do you want to know everything about me? No, I'm here for the purpose of marketing our products. Please sit. Shall we talk until Sir comes back? What's there to talk? Do you have any plan to buy a new car? Sit. Do you have such a plan? I don't have such a plan now. I'll inform you when I plan to buy a car. Okay. One second. - I'm Thomaskutty. - What's up? Catherine likes a guy. Hang up the call, stupid. Listen to me. I got another girl. Go and find some other job, shameless! What did he say? Nothing. Marketing. Don't be so formal. Let us chit chat until Sir comes. Let's share some good vibes. Balu has told me everything about Sir. Are you here on Sir's invitation? I felt so. Good start. Would that be Kuriakose Sir? Let me go and check. Is it Sir? No. No? Then, don't open the door. My image will go if anyone sees us together. One minute. Will you come that side? One minute. Into the bedroom? So fast? Acha... Is Achayan not home? No. He'd asked me to come regarding a document... Who are you? I'm Jayadevan. I'm the station S.I. of Kundanoor. Is Achayan not home? Kuriakose Sir is not here. He has gone outside. Don't know when... When you call him, 'Sir'... Are you not related to him? Who are you? I... I'm Honey. I'm his friend. Didn't he tell that I would be coming? No. Do you recognise me? He must have told you about me. He'd promised me a gift. Didn't he introduce me to you? When I saw you all of a sudden, I didn't get you. I never thought that my gift would be so nice as this. But... Gift? Gift is for me. I'm the one. You wouldn't have recognised me. I... It's me who, he told, would come. Yes, now I understand. Hope you recognized me? Yes, I did. - Sorry, dear. - That's okay I'm so desperate. It has been a year since I had any such relationships. That's why I hurried up. I'm also sorry... I had to confirm the person first. Yes, of course. This is day time. Sorry. Don't feel bad. The thing is, My wife is waiting in a textile shop. It's in between I came here. Because this was pre-planned, no? That's okay, please sit. That's why I hurried up. Otherwise, I would've controlled myself. I got late due to the traffic. I need to go back, right? Will Achayan come back soon? He doesn't have to come back right now, no? That's true. He needn't come back right now. Shall I offer you something to drink? No need. I'll get you some Badam milk. - Achayan drinks it often. - No need. He drinks it often. It must be useful. Badam milk, right. Take some. - I'll be back soon. - Okay. But you told you were going to get Badam milk. This is a special item. Achayan's special... Achayan is a guy of variety. It must be special. When you come next time, don't be in a hurry. Don't we have to spend some time with each other? Sure. This time, I couldn't help it. That's okay. Still, won't you spare 10 minutes for me? - Why not? - To freshen up. Definitely. Come to the bedroom after 10 minutes. Agreed. - Okay. - Okay. Sir is here. We are going straight away for the verification, right? I hope they called you yesterday. - Good morning. - Sir, the key. Okay. It's a problem only when we are late. - Dude. - Yes. Our senior manager is on leave. So, this too became my responsibility. Make it fast. Go and start the vehicle. Start the vehicle? Go, the shop will close soon. I can go only after going home. What's taking you so long? Yes, Kalyani. - Landed? - The key is with Rony. But... Where's she? I'm innocent, Sir. Where's she? She took me into this room. Sir, I got into the wrong flat. Who is this? Who are they? I don't know, Sir. I'm here for the first time. Who's lying inside a blanket? Achayan. Dearies... Awesome means awesome. Achayan and Osho believe so. Enjoy each and every second of life. Jerry, When you got a girl aside, you hesitate even to pick my calls. Kuriakose. DLF or LDF? No matter where you hide, I'll get hold of you. DLF... DLF... DLF... What shall we do, Sir? But... Achayan... He's dead, right? If we stay here longer, we will be caught. - Shut your mouth. - I haven't done anything. Shut your mouth. Come on. - Where is she? - I don't know. She is no where to be seen. - Look around. - Sir, come with me. You may check her out. Shucks. - Anyone there? - Shucks. No one. Isn't the bag yours? - Yes. - Then, take it. Let's escape from here. This is a number lock. My phone is missing. My phone... Where's the phone? Shucks! Where has it gone? My phone is missing too. Sir... Bloody... Has the Easter celebration began? What an outfit is this? No one wears anklets with jeans. Shut your mouth. Let others know that we are modern. Look at this. Nice, no? Not bad. Isn't it Kanjeepuram? Yes, it is Kanjeepuram. I like it. I'll take this. Okay, mom. Madam, Have you come alone? - Hasn't Sir come? - No. He has gone to catch a rape accused. Bye. Is it true that dad has gone to catch a rape accused? Is it good to say that he is loitering around? How long have we been waiting here? What to do now? There's a limit for everything. Hey, anything gonna workout? Is he picking the call? I'll pick the call now. Sir, what shall I do now? It's my daughter's marriage tomorrow. You must get me the gold. I'll get you the gold. Please wait for sometime. There's a limit for everything. - Excuse me, Sir. - Yes. I have an idea. Can you break the door? To break open your own bank? Get lost. Why is Rony not sitting? Do you have piles? I don't want to sit. Bloody, sit. Sit. At a glance, you will understand a girl's pulse. Won't you? And you want to sleep with her right away. You may enjoy. I'll help you out. What's your friend's name? - B... Balu. - Balu. He is smart at wooing girls, right? You want to sleep with me. But... You feel shy to be seen with me. I'll help you build an image that suits you well. Desperation. You have been waiting for me for the past one year. Right? Now... How do you feel? Do you like me? I'll kill all of you the way I killed Kuriakose. - But, for what? - Shush! Firstly.. I love to kill dirty people like you. Secondly... All of you know that I killed Kuriakose. So... Shouldn't I kill you as well? Why do you want to kill us? Tell me. But why kill us? Hi, dears... Human beings live on hopes and expectations, rather than real joy and happiness. Enjoy every second of the life. Get out. How many times did I tell you that. Kuriakose is not here. Finally, Bengalis have started beating Malayalees. Go away. Hey, Bengali. There was a time when you didn't have wheat to make chappatis, and dal to make curry. We are the people who considered you as guests back then. Do you know that? You, being one among those people... - Go. - I'm going, man. Why do you lock horns with me? When you come for pre-marital counseling, the couple will be sharing so much of love. You must keep up your promise, and value the word you have given to your life partner. The promise given by husband to wife, and wife to husband. The success of a marriage depends on keeping up of those promises made to each other. You must keep your word until death. What will happen if you don't keep your word? You will have to move away from life, and sit outside. Therefore, you must keep your promises and live carefully. The lives of those who have not kept their promises have gone wasted to an extend that we can't bring them back to life. Then, they will be in a race to get back their lost lives.. The wife blames her husband, and the husband blames his wife. And they go back home in the same car. He didn't pick the call, did he? They will have to bare the guilty that... I feel that he is not a guy that suits our family. They can't get their lives back. Weren't you guys in deep love? Will you keep mum, Uncle? At that moment, you will blast at your parents or guardians. There's no use of doing that. But... I won't kill any of you. If I kill you, you won't loose your image. Neither S.I. Sir nor the banker's image will go. So... What shall I do? Kuriakose and all the three of you tried to abuse me. Honey... I want to kiss you. I have been waiting for you. As a defense, I pushed Kuriakose. His head hit on the floor and he died. If so, all the three of you, will go to jail, right? Won't you go to jail? Ain't I right? Yes. Yes. Yes. If you liked him, why did you make that poor guy come after you? That's because... As we studied together in the same class, same college, I thought that he would propose to me. When the college got over, I thought... Let him come after me for sometime. If Jerry is not picking your calls, message him. All the flats look alike. Which one is it? Found his flat. Kuriakose. Yes. Naughty girl, where is he? Who are you? Don't try to make a fool out of me. Naughty girl. Call him. Hey, get out, Mr. I'll go out. Before that, let me see his happy face. - Hey, Jerry. - Will you please get out? Asking me to get out? I'll go only after finding him. Jerry. Jerry. Where did you hide him? - Jerry. - Jerry. Were you hiding there? Come outside. I found you. Catch. There is no use of just blaming the new generation. Even the parents are all the time on the phone. The videos they share are so ridiculous that nothing of it could be discussed anywhere. May be this is what our forefathers called as Kali Yuga. She is crazy, Sir. Though she is crazy, she looks hot. She looks like a lobster that has come out of its shell. Why do you do this to me, sister? Get lost. Who is your sister? I'm a called girl. That's how you felt on seeing me, right? Let's celebrate. Let's the call the police and celebrate. Sir, aren't you a policeman? Tell her. Tell her. Listen. I'm saying this because I'm an S.I. If the police come, not only us, but you will also get into trouble. If Kuriakose's body is subjected to postmortem, the time of his death could be known. The CCTV footage can say that, it's you who came before us. So, if you could open the door, all of us could go out. Open the door, let's go. Gun is not the only thing I have. - Switch on the generator. - It's for that I'm going. Too sad that the power went off. - Hi, Honey. - Hi... Hi dears... Land, women, and the sky are the zones to be dominated by men. Enjoy every moment of the life.

How long shall we wait? Please wait some more time. Can't you understand it, if told once? Did he pick the call? He will pick the call, Sir. They must be thrashed heavily. Will you do something about it? It's been a long time. Can't you understand what we are saying? We have been waiting here for a long time. Finally, he's coming. Now, your problem will be solved. Please, move over. Where are you rushing to? I'm the MD of the bank. It doesn't matter who you are. I need my gold. Rascals! Shucks! What is all these? The key has been missing. It was with him. I'll get it in some time. Don't you have a spare key? That's inside the bank. Idiot! Break open the door. Go. Shall we go home, mom? Let dad come. He will be cleaning floor in any of the serials. Moron. Let him come back. Madam, If you could make the payment... My husband will come now. Then, Madam... Athira Silks is offering a purchase wallet card. You will get 10% discount, and 2% cash back. Shall I get you one? I won't understand it. Let him come. Okay. Sir. Where's Jayadevan? Didn't he come for your daughter's engagement? Whose daughter? Your daughter. Engagement of my daughter who's studying in 4th standard? Are you mad? It has been only 4 days since I took charge over here. Pick the phone. Hello, I'm S.I. Jayadevan's wife. Is he there? Will you pass the phone to him? Madam, C.I Sir is here searching for Jayadevan Sir. No body knows where he is. Jayadevan must report in front of me in an hour. Call cyber cell. Mom, I feel giddy. What's wrong, dear? Dear... What's wrong with you? Dear... dear... Sir. Sir. Are you going to sit here, listening to this mad girl? Don't we have to get out? That's what I'm also thinking. There's no use wasting time, thinking. We must do something. What can we do? She has a gun with her. Crap. If the gun is her strength, we must steal it. We can steal it only if she keeps it down. How is that possible? She is coming. Trust each other. Respect your parents. Let God bless you for having a wonderful family life. Wish you all the best. What's it? Want some? No. Okay. I want to loo. I'm bursting to pee. Oh, my Jesus! 3. Action! Got the... gun... Shucks! Are you not killing me? Couldn't you rather kill me? The plan failed. Everything is... lost... I'm helpless. Don't all of you feel like peeing? No, I don't. You can pee over there. The police will come now. Aren't you a cop? Police...? What nonsense is this? Is it not on the navel? No, that was long time ago. It must be on the buttock. Not there. Show your hand. Thank God. Were you inserting your head into dog's mouth? I don't remember anything, sister. Who brought me here? Dropped you here in the ambulance that carried the dog. What happened to the dog? The dog bit you, right? The lady owner fears that the dog might get some infection. She has given a letter to give you. Take it. As frustration is not considered as a disease, I'm not filing a complaint. Bastard. I read the letter. Sister, What's wrong with my girl? Doctor, Nothing to worry. She attained puberty. You can go and see her. Mom... It's nothing. Got scared? It's nothing, dear. It's nothing. Why don't you pick my calls, Jayetaa? Our daughter attained puberty. Shucks. Is it the police? Go and check. Hey. Hey. What the hell are you doing? You will die. - Leave me, Sir. - You come inside. You can't go out this way. Leave me, Sir. I can't stay here anymore. Can't you understand what I'm saying? Hey. What are you doing? What's the matter? He was trying to jump over the balcony and escape. He is a fool. I want to go home. Can't you understand...? Check who has come. Sit there, quietly. As his vehicle is lying outside, he will be here. Who's there? No idea. Two people are there. Is it the police? It's not the police. I don't know. I can't hear anything. Check them out. He isn't opening the door. I was hoping to have a peg. Ring the bell once more. There are 3 people. I knew that both of you would be here. Oh, Rosy... Achayan... I've asked you many times not to speak about that stalker. Can't you hear what they are saying? Listen to them carefully. He needn't come for my child's birthday party. They left. Who are they? I don't know. Anyway, they are not police. That was not police. If you had committed suicide... we would've been responsible for your corpse. True that they are not the police. There were 3 people. They might be his neighbours... or association members. Would she have asked them to come? That is also possible. Don't you believe it? There she is. It's okay that he's not replying to your messages. Even otherwise, he is not a match for you. When I called him, he picked the call, and told me that he likes another girl. Sorry, Jerry. I had a realization today... that we are not a match. Bye for ever. Okay, I'll call you back. Yes. Okay. What is he up to? Sir... Come outside. I'm caught. Listen. All of you get up. You will get new ideas if you sit here longer. Sit inside the room until the police arrive. Why would the police come here? Hey. Get up. Why do you behave like this to us? Why do you want to call police? I myself... I didn't say anything. We won't tell anyone about what happened here. Shall we go home? I'll take care of this. Forgive us for just one time. Please, sister. If my family comes to know, I'll be screwed up. - But, you... - Get inside. - Sir, please convince her. - Hey, girl. Achayan is there. Achayan who is dead. What is happening here? All of you teamed up for the drama, isn't it? Hey, girl, I'll show you... Hands move only to unwanted places. Achaya. Who is this? Doesn't she belong to your gang? How come...? No, Kuriakose. I came inside not at night, but in the daylight. That too, as per Achayan's invitation. Your arrival has been a surprise for me. I had a few other appointments. That's okay. Let's celebrate the day. Sorry. I don't drink alcohol. - Really? - Yes. Why so? I'll join you for a 'cheers'. Do you have juice? Just tell me what you want. I can arrange any varieties of juice for you. - Cheers! - Cheers! I hope there is no sleeping powder inside it. Will I do that to you? I've drunk Chivas numerous times. But, this peg tastes like honey. Really. My wife is in America. And my daughter is in Canada. They are enjoying life there. And I'm doing it here. Dear children, Life is like a steam cake maker. Love is like a steam cake. So, every man has to become a ladle that pushes the steam cake outside. By ACHAYAN. This has been set on the clock. I don't know why... I want to hear my voice all the time. Then, come on. Are you afraid of me, Honey? No. You will never ever forget this celebration. Okay, let's start. I feel the hangover, already. But, I had only two pegs. Come on in, my dear. Come. Come on. Who the dirty fellow is calling at this time? - Didn't you meet Sir? - No. I rang the bell. No body was there. Sir's car is there inside. A girl just went to see him. Come on, Sir. Let's see. What wrong did I do to you, girl? Why do you do this to me? I'm not Honey. Then, who are you? My name's Anjali. When you move ahead, there are two turns... - Isn't there a library nearby? - Yes. I got it. I'll be back soon. Which class are you studying in? I'm in 10th standard. You said you are working in KSEB, right? Actually, two of my classmates are in Electricity board. - Which section? - Accounts. I was just chatting with Mol. She's a little shy. No, she is smart. Let me get you some tea. I have told you everything about me. Why aren't you talking anything? I think you are not prepared for the marriage. It's my father who registered my name on the matrimonial. But I never thought that an alliance would come this fast. - So, I'm a bit... - Sister. Mom is calling you. I'm coming. This is a common trait of parents. They ask us to talk with each other. And the next moment, call us back. Father... No need to come. You carry on. You won't be able to talk like this after marriage. I guess, your father is friendly. He's my best friend. What? I don't understand anything, Vijayakrishna. Dad... Dad... Daughter... God, save my father. I found a picture on my dad's phone. Someone else's photo with my face on it. You are the reason why it reached there. Leave it. What about your son's marriage? The marriage has been fixed. Everything was arranged in a hurry. - Have you seen my daughter-in-law? - No. - She's the girl. - Let me see. Nice. Joseph, Have you got only this photo of her? There are many other hot pictures of her. Carry on, enjoy. Why did he say so? Please go, and ask him. Doctor, I don't see you here lately. There are a lot of patients. - Are you fed up with work? - Somewhat. Then, stop it. Get me a soda. - Kuriakose. - Yes. How did you get that girl's photo? I don't remember about it. I saw it on a Whatsapp group on my phone. Then, show it to me. It's a herculean task to search a photo from the phone. There are about 1.5 lakh photos on this phone. Is she the girl? I also heard the gossip that you told about me. Without checking the credibility of that photo... My dad is in the hospital right now. What we heard is true. He told that he had romantic relationship with you. I believe him. So, I believe what is said too. You may ask Kuriakose if you want. No... I'll send you his number. Okay. Okay. That is the day when I befriended you on the Facebook, became Honey, and started coming after you. From where did you get that photo? It came on my Whatsapp. Normally, I watch such photos, share it, and delete it right away. - What the hell is this? - Share, it seems. This is not the punishment for sharing the photo. But for the comment you made after that. I have slept with her before. She is super hot. Don't just leave her. Enjoy to the maximum. I'm here not because, I want to vent out my sorrow as my marriage got canceled. No other woman shall have such a nasty experience because of you. See the guys who have lined up here. If it was to kill, I must kill all of them. When you see a girl, the immediate thought is how to get her on bed. Morons. So... For the time being... None of you has to die. I'll die. Hey. Meet the consequences. Then? You may take the flat for yourself, dear. Achayan will go somewhere else and live. Please, don't harm yourself. - Please... - Children, Achayan and Osho are alike. We keep loving even in difficult times. Is it just that you did? Yes. According to this report, Kuriakose, None of your activities are going to take off. You are impotent now. Oh, my Jesus. Sit on the back, okay? Hey. Dude... Get lost, rascal. Okay, thank you so much. This is the model I told you before. Anjali. Krishnadas, Customer. Let me talk. Do you know this girl? She has slept with me long before. Bloody people like Achayan lives among us, as one among us.
