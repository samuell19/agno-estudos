KAVACH, India's pride. I hope that today the wait and the conflict is over. and we get our safety back. What's the status, Rohit? Jai Hind, Sir. Sir, 55 seconds to go. And Moorty sir is online. - Patch him through. - Patching him through. Moorty sir on your screen. Now. Jai Hind, Sir. - How are you feeling now? - Very bad. On such a short notice?! What's the emergency? Sir, there's a covert operation at 14:00 hrs. We received a lead just 15 minutes ago. I'm confident that we will reach the target today. That's great news. Let's pray that today India will get back it's Shield. Yes, sir. I hope. Alpha to target 30 seconds. Your hope always proves costly, Rathore sir. Jai Hind, ma'am. Ms. Vandana, please. It's not good to criticize the soldiers, when you are sitting in an AC cabin. We are not the politicians, to lose powers every 5 years. We are the soldiers, who dedicate our entire life for the country. Please. Rathore. What's the location? Undisclosed, sir. Rohit, how much time for agent Grey Fox to be online? - 10 seconds, sir. - 10 seconds, sir. I knew he will reach. He who can challenge the death, turns out to be the winner. I hope he defeats death today. I am not sure about the death, sir. But I am dead sure about Om. Sir, he's live. Alpha! Jai Bhavani! Jai Bhavani! - Bravo, come in. - Go for, Bravo. They already have the information about my arrival. How's that possible? Quickly, you.. What has happened, Rohit? Sir, I think we lost the power from the main source. What?! Turn the backup on. Sir, emergency backup power is not responding. Someone, go. Check the power grid. Go, fast. Go. Resolve the problem. Come on, fast. Is it only the connection or the entire mission has failed? - Ma'am, please. - Rathore. I want a full report on this. Oh, damn it. - Sir. - Rathore. Why is the main disconnected? There was some technical issue, sir. Oh, damn it. What about Om and the mission? I can't say anything for sure as of now. We are trying to reach him. Gosh, don't give me answers like a civilain. Do whatever you can. But find him. Om is our strong asset. And our last hope. And Rathore, he's your son as well. Get him. GET HIM! THERE! FIRE! GO! GET HIM! "Leave it, eyes." "Let the heart speak." "Leave it, eyes." "Let the heart speak." "Life is full of lies and pain." "Let it cry." "With a heavy heart," "With a heavy heart," "and disturbed mind." "Life is still moving on." "With a heavy heart," "With a heavy heart," "and disturbed mind." "Life is still moving on." Negative, Ro. "Happiness, you just leave it." "Let the sorrows speak." "Happiness, you just leave it." "Let the sorrows speak." "Heart is burdened with guilt and debts." "Let it rise above everything." "With a heavy heart," "With a heavy heart," "and disturbed mind." "Life is still moving on." "With a heavy heart," "With a heavy heart," "and disturbed mind." "Life is still moving on." Negative, Ro. Rishi, son! Rishi! Rishi son! Rishi run! Run son! Rishi run!! Run son!! Rishi run! Son!! Run son! Run! Dad! Run away, son. Run away. Rishi! Rishi, son. Om! Om! Okay. Sir, Om is back. What? Is Om alive? - Rishi! - Dad! Om! Dad! He will come. Huh? You found him? Is dad found? What do you mean? The house was on fire. They took dad away. Who were they? - I need to look for dad. - Wait! You're hallucinating, due to medication and weakness. Just sit. Rishi! Coming, dad. Om! Om, stop. Om! Om, go upstairs. - What's it, Ro? - Why don't you answer my calls? Are you guys okay? Is Om safe? Ro, exactly after two hours of your call we were attacked. Do you doubt me? If I had, I wouldn't have answered your call. Anyway, Om is safe with me right now. But they were professionally trained agents so, Check from which bureau they were. All from the fake accounts. Finger prints, face recognition data. I've checked everything. It was a decoy. - What?! - Hold down, Kavya. Cut the call right now. You may be tracked. Who were they? Why did they attack you? Not me, you were attacked, Om. Me?! Who are you? Why are you helping me so much? Let me think, Om. Don't add to my stress. Why do you call me Om? If I don't call Om "OM" then what should I call you? Rishi. I am not Om. I'm Rishi. I am Rishi. Om! Kasauli, 11. - What? - Kausali, 11! I want to go to Kasauli, 11. Stop thinking about Kasauli. Your safety is more important right now. Let me think, please. Hey, Om. What the hell you're doing? I want to go. Alright. I will take you there. What's there in Kasauli? Maybe, the answers to my questions. Sir. Sir.. There is a problem. You will have to come here. Om? Om? Dad! Om! Om! Why have you come here? I was standing right here. The entire house was on fire. Two men were dragging my dad away. Run Rishi! Run Rishi! Run! I shouted. Dad. But dad stopped me from running towards him. Those two men started pulling dad out. Moment I tried to run towards dad, a burning pillar fell in between us. Dad!! Dad shouted. Don't come here, Rishi. Run away. But I felt like I was frozen here. They took dad away. I ran away. And reached that milestone. After that, I... I don't remember anything. I don't remember anything! Battleship, mission, Arslaan, Rathore sir, our team. Do you remember all this? I only remember my dad. Is he your dad? Om! What the luck! There was SUV in your GPS. I mean there was GPS in your SUV. If it's possible for him, he will insert a chip in here as well. - Sir. - Sir. Om! How's he now? Did he say anything? Sir, he has no answer to our questions. What do you mean? I think he has lost his memory. - What do you mean? - Sir. He doesn't remember anything? - Sir, actually.. - Mind blowing. He's a mind blowing guy. Even after losing his memory he's sitting quiet. And still. - Doctor, has Om lost his memory... - Memory? I wonder how he's alive yet? No, doctor. Memory is important. Moorty, what is important? Dead man with his memory intact, or a living person with only hope? Hope, sir. Smart boy. He will definitely progress in life. I've never seen such a case in the medical history. That a bullet is pierced deep in his brain. Still he's moving normally. And I've heard that he even fights. I mean his muscle memory is strong. But you said there's a hope. Hope is dope. Possible that he will regain his memory tomorrow. It's also possible that he will never regain his memory. It's also possible that he has already regained his memory. - Smart boy, go and check. - Yes sir. - May I say something, sir? - Yes, of course. Order a cup of tea with biscuits. But doctor, he remembers a little bit. Little bit? One episode. Like that on TV. Full HD. There are three types of memory in human body. Sensory, short term and long term. Episodic memory is a type of long term memory in the brain. Moment when the bullet hit his brain, whatever he heard and saw, became the part of temporary memory. Now, he's traumatized in the loop of that memory. Oh, tea. I hope you all are not confused with what I am saying. Are you getting my point? So, his brain is mostly blank. Only about this much is left. Now, that trauma keeps flashing, every now and then. Now, I need to leave. I'm getting late. Tea was horrible! My two assistants are here for the observation. Do not call me if there's any urgency. Just message me. - Thank you! - Okay, bye! Sir, doctor is right. Om only remembers his dad. Good. You mean to say, he remembers Rathore. Not Rathore sir. But him, sir. - Dev?! - Yes, sir. He also said that he's not Om but Rishi. Only thing he remembers is the kidnapping at Dev's house. Rathore! Is this true? Yes, sir. You.. You mean Om is that traitor's son? Dev isn't proven guilty by the court yet, sir. His innocence isn't proven either. You've not just hid Om from me, but also the truth about him. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Had I known this before, maybe the traitor would've been jailed today, and the pride of this country, to its motherland. I can terminate you on this point. I thought you broke my trust two months ago. But it was broken years ago. One shouldn't even trust his shadow. You taught me, sir. I won't give you any explanation. It only weakens the truth. But even after this if you doubt my patriotism, then I am ready to face any punishment. Do you understand the repercussion.. PMO and NIA.. delegation's conference call is on, sir. I am coming. Sir, Vandana ma'am is also on line. I said I am coming. Yes, sir. Damn it! What if they'd have known this truth? This mission and the office would have been shut. Gone. Bloody hell! Now, listen to me carefully. This truth will remain between the three of us only. This incident should even be wipped off our memory. - I think I've made my point clear. - Yes, sir. - Rathore. - Yes. Do you also hold the same opinion about Dev? As far as I know, Dev is the biggest traitor of our country. You've got the wrong information. After the Pokhran nuclear test, Dev had become the future of Indian science. Today almost every country has the nuclear power. Unfortunately, nobody has the defense system.. ..to survive the nuclear attack. But we will build one. Could you please elaborate? Sure. Defusing nuclear missile before explosion is the science of this formula. We will make a translucent seath using, the different combinations of nuclear helmets, taking advantage of the micro-fluid technology. Moment the missile enters the surface of this, before it getting triggered the missile's fission and fusion will get deactivated as soon as it touches the sheild. No explosion. No radiation. In simple terms. Only one thing can defeat nuclear energy. And that's nuclear energy itself. Sounds interesting, Dev. But is it possible? Sir, even Pokhran nuclear test, wasn't possible until 1998. Pokhran wasn't the first nuclear test. There are many examples. Exactly. So, we will become the example of this new technology. It's the power of science to turn the thoughts into reality. Who all will be in your team? Rajat Tharod and Deewan Shankar. Blue print is almost ready sir. - Sir. - Sir. Design, development and test, will take at least 12 to 15 years. What will be the name of this project? It will protect my country like a shield. Therefore it will be called "KAVACH" - Congratulations, sir. - Thank you so much. From tomorrow onwards, you will get security 24/7. Security will bring in alot of attention, I don't think it's a good idea. Security is not an idea. But an order. Congratulations. Thank you. It was impossible without your support. No, it was all you. Well deserved. Sir, we've also called DRDO team. We will share blue prints with them as well. But sir, why DRDO? More hands means faster completion of the project. But, sir. Blue print isn't ready as yet. We can call DRDO later. Right, sir. - Dev, are you sure? - About? About your team. They don't sound confident about this from now itself. Don't worry, guys. Blue print will be ready, sir. Within a weak. Okay, lets go. Dev was a workaholic He was temperamental. But he wasn't a traitor. Sir, how come you're so confident about Dev? Because both the sons of Major Uday Rathore, Dev Rathore and Jai Rathore can never betray their country. Dev is my real elder brother. Move. Move. I hope there isn't any casualty. No, sir. There's no casualty. The house is empty. - Empty? - Yes, sir. Sir. Sir, where are you going? Sir. Sir, please stop! Sir! Brother Dev. Sir, it's not safe. Sir, where are you going? Sir, don't go there! Sir! Brother Dev. Rishi. Brother Dev. Rishi. Rishi. Rishi. Brother Dev. Rishi! Rishi! My wife Yashvi, took care of Rishi like a mother. Dad. Brother Rishi?! Yes, Om. Henceforth, Rishi will stay with us. And Om, you must take care of Rishi. 8 year old Rishi gave the same statement to CBI.. ..that he gave you in Kasauli. Alright. Think again. If you've seen anything. Try to recall. Do you remember anything? Had your dad said anything? Tell me, son. Dad told me to run away. Please bring my dad back. - Please, I want my dad back. - We will.. Officer, please. He told you whatever he knew. He's already traumatized. - Okay. - Go, son. Take him. Do you know, that we've another version of this child's story? What do you mean? Bring him in. Sajjan?! Tell them everything. Sir, before leaving for home, I had seen something that night. What did you see? Deewan and Rajat were spraying fuel in the house. And then they had set the house on fire. Tell them who set the house on fire. Speak up. Who had set the house on fire? Sir.. The senior sir. - What nonsense?! - Jai. Jai. Jai. Mr. Rathore, he hasn't completed his statement. Continue. Sir.. Dev sir told Deewan and Rajat.. ..that Rishi will be the witness of this accident. And he will tell the same thing to the police. Everybody will believe a child's statement. - I won't spare you. - Jai. - He's speaking lies. - Behave yourself. - But he's speaking lies, sir. - Cool down. - Brother can never do this. - Cool down, Jai. This isn't true, sir. Evidence will tell the truth. I said cooperate. My mind had become completely numb. TV channels used to telecast the same news every day. Breaking news. Nuclear scientist Dev Rathore has been kidnapped. Is it kidnapping or Dev Rathore's plot? 8 year old child and 35 year old servant's statements mismatch. But the truth.. What are they saying about Dev? Don't worry. Truth will be out very soon. How's Rishi? He's getting back to normal. - Comfortable with Om now. - Good. You go inside. I will check. Sir. Sir, please save me. - Sir. - What has happened to you? - Keep this door closed, sir. - Sajjan. - Sir, please save me. - Sajjan. Save me, sir. Please, save me. - Save from whom? - Sir.. Rajat and Deewan's men will kill me. Save me, sir. Sir.. Sir. I want to tell you something. What is it? That night I had.. Lie down. Don't get up. Sajjan. Sajjan. Sajjan? Sajjan. - JAI! - Yashvi. JAI! JAI! Rishi! Rishi! How are the kids? Om! Om! Om! Om! Om! Om! Om! Name of the child that expired? And Yashvi said something that I would never have the courage to. Child's name? Rishi Rathore. Rishi Rathore *Echo* Rishi's life was at risk after Sajjan was attacked. And to save Rishi, it was important to declare him dead. I had resigned from the army and joined RAW. Even Yashvi had no clue about it. The only mission of my life was to find 'Kavach' and Dev. Rishi needed a mother. And Yashvi needed a son. Both had fulfilled each other's needs. The only goal of Rishi's life was to search his father. All he needed was the guidance, in the right direction. Rishi proved himself stronger, than what I had thought him to be. Son, the symbol of Om is slanting. Let it be, mom. Every time I will make it straight, it will remind me that I am not Rishi but Om now. It is a proud moment for any father, to hug and see his son being well grown up. She hasn't slept all night, waiting for you, Go. Meet her. Ma, is it ready? Before your arrival. I've worked with every wing of RAW from past 15 years. And gathered all the intel related to Kavach. I am listening. I've a dedicated team. If this separate wing gets an approval then I promise, I will bring country's Kavach back to it. Why Om Rathore? Don't make it a family affair. Don't go on his surname, but his capabilities, ma'am. All his reports are present in the file. He's one of the best Para- Commando we have, ma'am. Mr. Rathore, you very well know that, a part of your family is on the other side. Still, you want me to approve this file? Ms. Vandana, this project is on your table, based on its strong intentions and papers. If it wasn't about the protocol, I would've taken permission directly from PMO. If you're still apprehensive, I will lead this special wing. Om, journey towards your only goal since childhood, begins from today. Your path won't be easy. Challenges and decisions will be tough. Remember one thing. Nation will always come first. To win a battle, you have to win many fights. Till the last drop blood, I will protect my nation. Jai Bhavani! Jai Bhavani! Sir, Om's and your sacrifice is inspirational. But looking at Om's present condition, do you think he will be able to rejoin the force? Leave me! - Om! - Get away. What are you doing, Om? Leave me. - Om! Om! - Rishi! Huh? What am I doing here? What is going on? You want to know about your dad, right? Yes, Yes. He will tell you. He is Jai Rathore sir. Sir, he's Rishi. Your trust is shaken. Before telling you everything, I'd like to show you something. RAW started this special wing, to find out your dad and the 'Kavach'. And this project made you 'Om". You were, you are and you will always be our Om. During the operation Kavach, you had reached quite close to 'Kavach'. But right at that time a bullet hit your head. And you lost your memory. You mean my life's only goal was this? To find my dad. Maybe that's why even after losing your memory, you still remember him. - I will find him, sir. - Not now. You're emotionally and physically unstable, at the moment. To accomplish this mission, first you need to recover yourself completely. I will do anything to reach my dad. Sir. I wanted to ask you something, sir. Why didn't you tell him about yourself? Everything has to be done on its time, Kavya. Relations are never disclosed on the battleground. Only Om can reach our target. And for this battle, I don't need weak Rishi, but brave and daredevil Om. You better get him ready. Yes, sir. How's my Om? Jai! I've asked you several times. Neither do you bring him home, nor do you tell me anything. What do I say? He's emotionally unstable. And can't say about his memory. Jai, bring him home once. Possible that he recollects everything once he sees me. It's not possible, Yashvi. Be practical. A mother's emotions.. I can't give him more stress, over your emotions. Only five minutes. And promise me. You will not attempt to remind him anything. I promise. I will not remind him anything. He will regain his memory the minute he sees me. I am sorry. Ma! Om! Om! Seeing your mother, you now remember everything, isnt it? Yashvi. Yashvi. Yashvi. Om. My wife. Yashvi Rathore. Hello, ma'am. - I will go, get a file. - Sure, sir. - Come in. - No, it's okay, ma'am. Sir will be back soon. Come, son. Come in. Come. Have a seat. Please. Would you like to have something, Om? Tea or coffee? No, sir. Thank you. I am fine. I will bring something for him. I am sure he will like it. Sir, your house is really beautiful. Thank you. Feel at home. Here you go. Have some pudding. Thank you, ma'am. - How is it? - Delicious. It feels like I've tasted this before. - Om, let's go. - Yes, sir. Wait for me in the car. I will be there. Okay. Thank you for the pudding, ma'am. He remembers the taste of my cooking but not me. I was the mother of two kids, Jai. But today none of my sons are with me. One is dead and, the other one has forgotten me. Control yourself, Yashvi. I guarantee you. One day, your Om will return to you. 'Om, you're the creator.' 'You're the savior and you're the destroyer.' The universe resides in the word OM. You're born to protect the country, and destroy the enemies. Welcome back, Om. We can't waste more time, sir. We must find Kavach soon. I will also prove that my dad isn't the traitor, but the patriot. Hello, everyone. Today you're going to witness, the biggest defense system ever created. Fasten your seat belts, and thank you for coming. Our defence system can deactivate this nuclear missile containing, 20% of highly enriched Uranium energy, that has the lethal power to destroy a radius of 301 kms on impact. Okay, what's the target? What? Here? Is this a joke? Oh my god! What's going on? Missile didn't explode, but it definitely scared them. Let the auction begin. This is your last footage found on body cam's live feed, on the battleship. Nobody knows what happened after that. Maybe not even you. - What's this? - Your body cam. It's memory stopped working. Just like you. If I will pull it emotionally then... It will damage. Maybe what you can't remember, it might be in this. Ro.. - Sorry. - Where's Arsalaan? How do you remember Arsalaan? You had mentioned about him at Kasauli house. 'Mission, Arsalaan, Rathore sir, our team.' Sir has messaged, I am leaving. You guys continue. Okay. Operation Kavach's team had 6 members. Arsalaan was one of them. What about the other 5? We didn't get big breakthrough, in the first two missions of operation Kavach. All our hopes were on this False Flag Operation Huge amount of lead shielding was dealt in one of the north east China border camps. This element is used in Kavach to produce anti radiation. And I was leading this operation. We were waiting for Arsalaan's signal. And as usual, he had shared the information about this deal. You! Get up! Move! You! Keep it there! Everyone in position? Zulu in position. - Whiskey in position. - Fox Trot in position. Quebec in position. - Brilliant! Get the job done! - Sure sir, absoutely! Quebec, Zulu. - Engage. - Engaging now. Fox Trot, targets on your north west. Whiskey, look east. 2 more targets. Whisky, look east, incoming target. Where are you from? Which organization? Who send you? Huh? You tell me! Which country? Hey, you. What about you? I don't know about you all. But I'm going to recall my God. HARI OM! Quebec. Secure the package. - Securing package! - Go! Go! Go! Pick it up! Pick it up! Go! Package secured. Let's move. Where's Om? Guys, let's go back. Om will need backup. No need. Let him be. (other language) Brother, what? Your best friend needs backup. Om himself is the backup. Turn your backs. Rescuing them wasn't a part of our mission. Mission is not just about killing people but also about saving lives. "Dark..." "Dark..." "Dark..." "I'm the water and I'm the fire." "I'm the rising youth." "Like there's moon in the sky, I'm on the earth." "Observe carefully and you will find me everywhere." "Everybody yearn me." "You guessed it right, I'm that damsel." "He's the heartthrob and I desire him." "My heart beats for the one, who dwells in these eyes." "Dark..." "Dark..." "Dark..." "Dark..." "I've applied the darkest kohl in my eyes." "The darkest..." "The darkest..." "it has done the magic." "The darkest" "I've applied the darkest kohl in my eyes." "The darkest" "The darkest..." "it has done the magic." "The darkest..." "Even the alcohol is not as intoxicating as you." "You're counted amongst the wonderful." "Do me a favour. Give me a space in your heart." "I won't relent otherwise." "Dark..." "I've applied the darkest kohl in my eyes." "The darkest..." "The darkest..." "It has done the magic." "The darkest..." "I've applied the darkest kohl in my eyes." "The darkest" "The darkest..." "it has done the magic." "The darkest..." "My life came to a standstill, the day I fell for you." "The lips locked and the heart was on fire." "My life came to a standstill, the day I fell for you." "The lips locked and the heart was on fire." "He's the heartthrob and I desire him." "My heart beats for the one, who dwells in these eyes." "Dark..." "Dark..." "Dark..." "Dark..." "Dark..." "I've applied the darkest kohl in my eyes." "The darkest..." "The darkest..." "It has done the magic." "The darkest" Maybe that was the last chapter of our togetherness. Team had parted following different leads. Parting was okay. But when Bala was found dead in Kowloon. Matthew in Riyadh. And Arsalaan's dead body found in Chengdu, We were shattered. When you too went missing for two months, Rathore sir appointed Rohit in the office. And he put me on hold until the next operation. Then one evening. - Ro?! - Pack your bags. Only the three of us know that Om is alive. Until my next order, You will keep Om in the safe house. Your expertise in both, medical and battle fields will be needed, Dr. Kavya. Rohit will be in touch with you. Yes, sir. Yes, Rohit. Okay. Om, we need to go. Our sensing military satellite GSAT 7A, located in the Sweetspot, has sent a surveillance report. Mild gamma ray and neutron activity, has been detected in this area. But, sir, there's something strange. I'm scaling the image for you. Nuclear missile was launched, but it was deactivated before the explosion and radiation. Maybe, the launch had failed. No, sir. It wasn't the launch fail. It was deactivated. What do you mean? A defense system was used to deactivate this nuclear activity. What kind of defense system? This defense system's formula and pattern is same, on which India was working, 15 years ago. Kavach. Are you sure? Unfortunately... - Yes, sir. - What the hell! 'Why didn't you tell Om about yourself?' 'Everything has to be done on it's time, Kavya.' 'Relations are never disclosed on the battleground.' Om. Dev was my childhood friend. And you were more than my younger brother. He broke my trust. And you didn't trust me. I didn't get you, sir. Oh, really? What will you say about Dev now? Who was right? You or me? Even my image is tarnished due to Dev. You're talking about the trust, sir. I doubt myself at many instances everyday, sir. After yesterday's Kavach test, I'm losing the last hope we had. You've already lost it. Do you see that envelope? Vandana madam just gave it. Well, go ahead. Open and see it. What? Agency terminated?! All the doors are closed. We can't escape this time. Sir. Kavach test was done just yesterday. And today our wing has been suspended. This can't be the co-incidence, sir. I doubt there's somebody amongst us, who wants to sabotage our mission. And he has succeeded. He knows that we are close to Kavach. Very close. But everything is over now. Over? Is Jai Rathore saying this? Should we give up on the mission in the last moment? If you decide, then impossible is nothing. And that's the Rathore I always knew. We've several valid intel related to Kavach. Our team is ready and so is Om. Om. This will be a black operation. Unofficial. Sir. If caught, you're on your own. Sorry, sir. Vandana madam forgot her phone in the cabin. Rathore. Vandana madam's phone will be there. Om?! I've a question that only you can answer. My heart isn't ready to believe but my mind says, that this isn't Rajat and Deewan's cup of tea. Kavach test is impossible without your father. My answer is 'yes'. This wasn't my question. You told me everything. About my dad, about Kavach, about the country. About me. Then why didn't you tell me about yourself? What do you want to know about me? Who took care of me after my dad went missing? Who helped me overcome that trauma and encouraged me? Who lost his own son and accepted me as his own? That's you, right? Dad? Who told you this? Why didn't you tell me this? Nation comes first, Om. I wanted a warrior. Not a weak son. But how would my mother feel, when I failed to recognize her? And today... When we are losing all the hope, You didn't think I was capable enough to share your grief? Did you not feel like hugging your son even once? Dad! Dad! - Dad! - Don't let me fall down, son. No Dad! No! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! "Life is in this moment." "Now, the journey is complete." "These eyes see.." "..nothing even at the farthest distance." "My eyes may or may not remain open." "But your dreams will always last." "Your head will be held high in pride." "That'll be the dawn for me." "If I die for you, I'd be fortunate." "Even if I jump in the fire, I won't feel the burn." "I'd shatter into pieces.." "..and sacrifice for you." "Accidents will make me brave and stronger." "That'll be the dawn for me." We've lost everything. Nation lost a brave soldier. I've lost a good friend. And you've lost a person, who was more than a father to you. We've the intel information. Dev is behind Jai's death. Jai never believed that Dev is the traitor. But I hope you won't make the same mistake. Take care. "I've vowed in your name." "That's my story." "You're everything to me, my shelter as well." We don't have the right to cry. They fight on borders and we fight here. battle may be won by anybody, but in the end, both lose. We've to die for the nation but can't shed tears. Every day, when he would return home, I'd be at peace. Now, I've lost my peace forever. Jai always said that... We, the women are very strong. And a soldier's wife is stronger amongst them. These eyes... I've no right to cry. You do have the right, ma. You have the right to cry on your son's shoulder. Om! There's a limited space in my life, Om. If one enters, the other leaves. Now the only ones that will die, are the ones who are behind all this. If Dev Rathore is a traitor, then there will be nobody to perform his last rites. What's this? Dad had given this device to mom. And told her to hand it over to me in case he dies. Om, we should take Moorty sir's help. That's not possible. Operation Kavach has been terminated. Now, we've to do everything. But how can we handle a covert operation, all alone? Who will help us? Jai Bhavani! There are the signs, that means I am no more. Listen to me carefully. Not by your ears. - Ears only. - Change the plan if it doesn't work. End of a caterpillar is the beginning of a butterfly. It's nowhere. Everything is here. Only when you break, you will unite. If there's darkness, there will be light. And it will guide you. Third umpire will keep an eye on you. So, change the masks not the faces. Along with the motherland, take care of your mother, too. Jai Bhavani! Jai Bhavani! - What was that? - A coded message. It would have remained safe, even if it had gone in the wrong hands. There are the signs, that means I am no more. Dad knew that both, operation Kavach and his life are at risk. Right. This is his last memento and last order. Change the plan if it doesn't work. End of caterpillar is the beginning of a butterfly. Which means if plan A doesn't work, then initiate the new plan. Makes sense. It's nowhere. Everything is here. Only when you break, you will unite. Only when you break, you will unite. Only when you break... There's nothing in it. - Do you have the burner phone? - Yes. There's light in the darkness. Do you have the fake ids? - How many do you want? - Only three. Goa, Chennai, Kolkata. Sir, they've left from here. Ma'am, they've reached the Chandigarh airport. I'm sure they are using fake Id's to fly. - ID? - Trace them! Keep an eye on their whereabouts. Ma'am, you're right. Tickets are booked through the fake ids. As of now, they are flying for Goa, Chennai and Kolkata. Activate our agents in all the three cities. Keep them under surveillance. Inform me as soon as they land. Jai hind, sir. Yes, sir. Jai hind, sir. Sir, I am in position. Sir. Jai hind, sir. Flight has just landed. - Copy, sir. - Flight has just landed. Yes, sir. I am waiting. Damn it. Sir, nobody is here. - Nobody is here, sir. - Negative, sir. Sir, nobody is here. They conned us. Trace all three of them. Third umpire will keep watch. So, change the masks, not your faces. Planned fake Id's and travelled with the real ones. Respect, bro. Bro! Stop, man. I can't walk anymore. Please. - We've reached. - Huh?! Reached? But nobody is here. Who's that? She is coming here. Om?! Jaadu? (Magic) Om! I'm suspicious. Come on. Okay, there are more people. Nice! Woah! Are they playing relay? Om, that lady left us in the lane. This lady will leave us nowhere. Om. Let's go. I am not coming. C'mon! Here I am. Arsalaan?! Arsalaan? I can't believe this! Ro! See. His friend is still alive in his heart. But you were... What do you think? That I was dead? It was just a decoy. Then whose burnt body did they find? Somebody else was burnt. For me, I was shot! I lost my leg, but I survived. Never mind. We are here now. To trouble you. Who else knows that you're alive? Rathore sir and you. I gave you the lead for battleship too. Anyways, guys. Sync your watches. Arsalaan, we are running out of time. What's the next lead? Hu La. Mark Kapustan and Borris Okaro. Today, everybody in the black market, is eyeing this deal of Kavach. And it can be locked any moment. Every business has its own chain. Seller, buyer and a bridge connecting them is broker. And these three are the biggest brokers of arms and ammunitions in the international black market. Extremely powerful. Hu La. He deals with the third world countries. Second one is Mark. Let's not discuss him now. And the third one is Borris. He deals with the militant groups. Why? Is Mark dead? No, he isn't but his condition is worse than the death. What do you mean? He's in the most secured jail of Armenia. Such a big broker and he's been in jail from the last 10 years. Then how come he's still in top 3? - Rohit! - Yes. Can you hack this jail's surveillance? Of course. Catch! Move. You take care of this. And I will take care of this. Don't go to the jail. - Borris is a better lead. - Wait a minute. Guys, I am in. See, everything is quiet. Om, he's right. Somebody is smoking. Somebody is eating. A trailer has arrived on the gate number 11. Shall we focus on Borris instead? Alright. Stop. Where's that trailer? It was right here. Are there any more cameras? Let me check. There are three more on the back gate. Just a second. I will just get the live feed. Focus on camera number 24. Zoom in. This is Mark. Om, are you seeing this? Where did he go? Guys, quickly wear your earpiece. Om! Om, where are you? Going to the jail. We can't lose Mark. - Rohit, guide me. - Copy. Om, go straight for 2 kms then take left. Om, wait a minute. What happened? Trailer has left from the jail. Where is it going? E-5 highway. What's my distance from the trailer? 12 kms. Take the second exit from Yerevan market. The trailer has entered the city tunnel. Who the hell are you? Rishi. Rishi, my son. Don't call me "son" I'm not scared of you. I'm scared of the hatred that I see in your eyes. These eyes also have some questions. And you're proven wrong in every answer. Me? You and your greed were wrong. That small kid's death because of you, was wrong. Since childhood, I died every day due to shock. That was wrong. The brother who loved you alot, killing him, That was wrong. It was wrong to betray the nation. Today everything wrong will turn right. Then what about the truth that I've faced for 17 years? I've the right to speak that truth. And you must listen to it. Then it is up to you. You decide what you want to do. Finally, it's out! Rajat and Deewan were corrupt. But when I refused to betray the nation, you already know what they did. Run! Rishi! - Dad! - Rishi, run away. They tried to break my morale every day. Neither they were tired nor did I give up. But I was shattered with the news of your death. I had nothing to lose now. The only reason I had was the Kavach, which I had to return to my nation. So I started working on the Kavach, with the help of Rajat and Deewan. I gave 20 years of my life to Kavach. Only on a hope that one day my brother Jai will come in search of me. My strength doubled. And courage multiplied, when I heard that you're alive. But life plays a different game with us. Hope, that connects you, breaks you the most. Jai's death shattered me completely. But today, I feel proud to see, that a son has his father at gunpoint, for his nation. Think over it. How can your father be the traitor? Hmm? Om. Stop, Om. See this first. The one who finished our team. The one who killed Rathore sir. Even the one who shot you at the battleship, he's the culprit behind all of this. Moorty?! Son. We don't have much time. - Where's Dev? - He will be here with Mark. Both, Dev and Mark are on the way. Let's have a drink. There's a highly secured location, on Armenia and Iran border. Today Moorty is going to deal Kavach over there. That deal will not happen today. Stop, son. I will have to go there before you. Because as soon as you reach there, they will get alert. And take Kavach in their control. Kavach's core can't be opened without my biometric. I will have to go there and secure it first. Om. He's right. Kavya, you go with dad. Keep me updated until he reaches the Kavach. Okay. Son. Ruthless mercenaries are always on guard, on that location. It will be difficult to break them. Dad, it's not the doors that always provide us the way out. Sometimes even the walls do that job. One just needs to know how to enter. - Sir. - Hmm.. Sir has walked out of the car. Two guards are with him. He's going towards the workstation. Security is too high. Looks like an Israeli force. Sir is in. Over to you, Rohit. Jai Bhavani! Jai Bhavani! - Jai Bhavani! - Jai Bhavani! - Cheers! - Cheers! Cheers! You know.. actually, okay.. I'll just be back. Sure, sir. You guys must be tired. Yeah, please have a seat. Dev, the information is that Om has reached. Delegates are here, Let's focus on the deal, okay. And also.. .. if Om has reached, then he must know about you. Rathore.. Rathore, what happened? I can't see anything. What has happened, Rohit? Sir, I think we lost the power from the main source. What happened? I can't see anything, Rathore. Om, as per my tracker Moorty sir is sitting with those delegates on the end of the location. Looks like the Kavach deal has begun. Dev sir has reached Kavach safely. Why is he taking so much of time? He shall be here in another five minutes. I think there is a problem. Kavs! Kavs. Look left. Truck approaching. Sir. How much more time it will take? The delegates are getting restless. - Sir, we don't have time. - I said I'm almost done. Guys, I think we should destroy the North wing. Their entire ammunition is over there. Dev. Dev. Dev, how much more time you will take? Your son is destroying everything over here. Five more minutes. He will turn this place into a graveyard in another five minutes. Rohit, what's the update? - Dev sir is still inside. - Okay. Om! Arsalaan. Didn't get a strong reaction! Moorty! Now, I get the reaction! Do you know how difficult it is, to hide yourself identity from everyone? I had to put on so many masks. I even betrayed with so much honesty, But it was all a waste. First it was Jai and now it's you, both of you caused so much trouble. I've already killed half of your team. Now, it's time to kill the rest of you too. Bullets don't work on you, I know. Break him. Hit him harder. Om. Om, we had promised Rathore sir. Kavach should go back to India at any cost. Today, nothing can come between you and Kavach, Om. Jai Bhavani! Jai Bhavani! Prayer. (Urdu) No, Arsalaan! Hey. No, Arsalaan. ARSALAAN, NO! Arsalaan? KAVYA!! Kavs? Kavya. Kavya. Kavya. Kavya. Kavya, Kavya! I'm fine. ARSALAAN! Arsalaan! Arsalaan! Arsalaan come in! Om, Moorty is trying to escape in the chopper. Om. Destroy them. Kavach. Dad, not just the Kavach, but we need to get that traitor too. Om! Om! I won't even take a minute to bury you here. But you're nation's culprit. And you will be buried there. Take me. I accept whatever punishment you give me. But don't hit me. I will punish him. NO DAD! Move. - NO, DAD. - Move, son. He snatched away my country from me. My identity. My brother. My son. He had snatched away everything from me. Everything. He had snatched away everything from me. Dad. Enough dad! No Dad! Enough Dad! No! What are you searching? Your innocent father? I had set that relation afire on the same night. My Kavach is my world. Outsiders supported me but not my own. Nobody can come between me and my Kavach. Neither my brother. 'I've terminated operation Kavach.' 'But your brother Rathore. He is unstoppable.' 'We've come long way, Moorty.' - 'Kill him. - Dev?!' 'He's your brother.' 'Would I have spared your brother?' Nor you. Dad! Dad was lucky. At least he died with a misunderstanding, that his brother is not a traitor. That last hope I had since childhood, is broken today. I could have killed you eariler as well. But I thought, sometimes even the wrong person, brings you to the right place. First Rajat, then Deewan and now Moorty. You've destroyed all the evidences. You sold the Kavach. Like your story, even this Kavach is fake. Real Kavach is over there. Nation's pride will return today but not the traitor. Because I had promised my mother. That if Dev Rathore is found traitor, there will be no one to perform his last rites. And I can't break my promise. How's your shoulder now? Much better. Hmm! On my way. "Yes, I'm crazy about you, and there's nothing else that interests me." "I swear time seems to drag on without you." "Where are you? Where are you?" "Why can't you hear me where you are?" "Every moment spent waiting for you is dragging." "I am your sky." "Please come see me in the guise of the moon." "Come and breathe life to my heartbeats." "I am your sky." "Please come see me in the guise of the moon." "Come and breathe life to my heartbeats." "Bring love when you come." "The kind that nobody has felt till now." "Bring love." "Drive me crazy." "The kind that will be mentioned even in heaven." "That which has never happened and will never happen in future." "That which will be used as an example by all." "Just fulfill this wish of mine." "Please come. Please come. Please come." "I will lay down my life for you." "Come and lay down your for me." "Come and breathe life to my heartbeats." "I am your sky." "Please come see me in the guise of the moon." "Come and breathe life to my heartbeats." Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
