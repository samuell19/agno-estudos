Return to a place where you are at peace and reflect on the idea of impermanence. The universe keeps moving and nothing will remain as it is, good or bad. By embracing inevitable change, we free ourselves from anxiety. Now, take one more deep breath in. One, two, three, four, five. And out. Five, four, three, two, one. I hope you enjoyed this calming midday meditation, and that you welcome the rest of your day with love and compassion. And when you are ready, open your eyes. Whatever you say, dude. Hello? Shit, Cheryl. It's the Jehovah's Witnesses. Again? Weren't they just here? I don't know. Maybe it's the Mormons. I just saw a smiling young person with pamphlets. - I looked out the window, but I don't think she saw me. - -What do we do? Hi. I did see you, and I can hear you. I'm just selling solar panels. That's just what they say to make you open up. No hablo ingles! Go, go, go! Maybe she won't notice. Get in, get in! Do you really think the world is going to end? No, I think we're doing great. The Dow is breaking records, so it's fine that the planet is melting, and think of all that empathy we've learned from social media. Didn't we talk about the sarcasm? Sarcasm is the least of my problems. Sarah, I know you're sick of hearing me say this over and over again, but you really need to accept that there are certain things that are always going to be out of your control. Why dwell on what you cannot change? Oh, I get it now. So I just stop worrying and the existential dread will vanish. Why didn't I think of that? Sarcasm. Fine, okay, yeah. I just won't think. That's not what I said. Well, it kind of is. It's really hard to think without worrying. The world sucks, haven't you noticed? But for the thousandth time, you can't control those things. You shouldn't waste your energy. Okay, but I do, because what's the point of putting any effort into anything long term if I'm not going to make it to 50? I mean, Jesus, how the fuck do people have kids in a world like this? I mean, best case, right, my body and mind slowly fall apart. And then I just die, I guess? A lot of people your age start to realize that they won't live forever. Maybe this is more about you coming to terms with your mortality. I mean, I definitely don't feel invincible anymore. But dying doesn't sound as bad as it used to. Have you thought about hurting yourself? No. No, no! That's not what I meant. Uh-huh. Well... It's important that you feel safe here and know that you can tell me anything. No, really, I'm fine. Okay, what I meant is maybe death isn't the worst thing possible. Like I'm not afraid of dying in the apocalypse as much as I'm afraid of surviving it. Meaning? Okay, for example, dying in a nuclear blast. It's quick, you're ash before you even knew it happened. But trying to survive in the radioactive hellscape that comes after that? Yeah. Imagine having that in your brain all the time, then being told to just not worry about it. You need to focus more on the real world. Spend some time with actual people. I don't see how that will help anything. Sarah, people need people. You need people. All right, well, we have to wrap it up. Same time next week? Isn't this supposed to be making me feel better? It's a process. Yeah, but... I've been coming here every week for the last two years, -paying a small fortune in co-pays. -It takes time. How much time? Do you think we've made progress? Because I don't see any. The progress isn't always obvious. But no, I don't think we've quite found the breakthrough we've been looking for yet. -So you mean that... -I'm sorry, we're really out of time. I'll see you next week. Come on, I have other shit to do, you know? So, are you excited for Friday night? What's Friday night? Fuck! I completely forgot. Sure you did. -Do I have to? -Yes! You need to get out more and stop being such a hermit. What's wrong with being a hermit? Ugh, who is this guy anyway? My brother's friend Tucker. He was just one of the indistinguishable douchey bros back in high school. But now, he's a successful entrepreneur and somehow got very cute. Your brother's friend? Really? That's not confidence inspiring. Yeah, I guess Brian hasn't always been the best judge of character. -So I can bail? -No. You're going, end of debate. Anyway, I'm sure he's much more mature now. -Just because you got fired from your dream job... -Laid off. I was laid off. Fired, laid off, whatever. Having to sell shit door-to-door doesn't give you an excuse to stay mad at the world forever. We need to get you out of this rut. Who says I'm in a rut? Look at you. All the hope is drained from your eyes. Instead of enjoying the best years of your life, you're fast-tracking it to the cat lady phase. Look. Ever since we met on the first day of kindergarten, have I ever steered you wrong? Yeah, fairly consistently. And we only met because you bit me. Doesn't matter. As your best friend, I insist. Fine. But I'm only doing this for you. Yay! Trust me, you'll have a great time. I'll make sure he texts you the deets. Now come on, I have to get in five miles before it gets dark. Sarah! How's it going? Hey Barry, all right. You? Feeling good, feeling good. Just got back from Vermont. Hey, I got some great shrooms if you need any. I'm good. Thanks, though. Cool. Cool. Yeah, so also, I hate to be like a capitalist but... I need you get me the rent at some point. Yeah, sorry, of course. I'll get you a check tomorrow. Right on! Power to the people. You too. I mean... yeah. ...discovered in the ruins of ancient civilizations that contain technology that is impossible for them to have developed on their own. When you look at it objectively, the only explanation is the intervention of a much more advanced race, which in all likelihood would have had to have been extraterrestrial in origin. Yeah, so I have no idea why my wife bothered calling you in the first place. We've never needed any of this green bullshit. And we certainly don't need it now. It's the god damned... Hey, Mom. Hey honey, how's it going? Um, it's good, just got done with work. Oh, good. Make any sales? What do you think? Oh, well, it'll get better soon. Probably not. You could always go back to actually using your very expensive degree. Nah, I enjoy being underemployed. Oh, come on, you're capable of so much more. I... You know, I'm actually not in the mood to be reminded of my vast achievements in underachieving. Okay, fine. Just know that I believe in you and think you're amazingly smart and talented. Do you have anything planned for the weekend? Ugh. Yeah. Thanks for reminding me. Oh yeah? What's going on? Kayla is forcing me to go on a date with her brother's friend. Oh, well! When is it? Tonight. Tried to get out of it, but here I am. Have you picked a cute outfit? Hmm, I kind of figured I would go with something casual. Why not be myself, you know? Oh, come on. You should get dressed up. You only get one first impression. Yes, Mother. Don't "Yes, Mother" me. You know I'm right. Just not him, not him. Please not him, not him. Fuck. Hey, you must be Sarah. -Tucker? -The one and only. Sorry. I was running a bit late. Have you been waiting long? Oh, it's no problemo. I threw back a few brews. You know, they got a great beer list. Oh, that's... cool, I guess. Oh, well sorry again for running behind. Do you want to see if our table's ready? You sure you don't want a drink first? Uh, well, I'm pretty hungry and... Come on, just one drink. You look like a vodka soda girl. Hey Tiffany... Uh no, I am actually trying to stay away from alcohol right now. Oh. Weird. Well, let's do this thing, right? Mmm. So we sold that company last year, which left me pretty flush with cash. I traveled for a while, saw some pretty amazing places and... Oh, have you ever been to Ecuador? I've been to Canada. Oh. Yeah, that's cool, I guess. Anyways, you should definitely check out South America if you get the chance. Spending time with the natives was just so... sick. I can't even explain. Anyways, I thought I had everything I ever wanted and I just started to feel kind of empty inside. Like nothing was doing it for me, you know? Thanks. Anyways, I just wanted to do something that mattered, you know? So that's when I started my new company. And what's this new company? We offer an instant delivery service for locally sourced IPAs. Uh-huh. I mean, it's going great so far, and it feels really rewarding doing something. It's like building the community. Something to make a difference, you know? Now, I don't really do any of the delivering or the lifting or the funding, but luckily the investors hopped right on board for this one, so... Looks like we'll have a pretty big payday when we sell in a few years. Mm-hm. Anyways, now that we had this nice meal, what do you say we go back to my place and smash? I know. You want some of this. Uh... no, thanks. -Really? -Yeah. I just want to go home. Wait, I buy you this nice meal and you're not even gonna let me hit that? I wasn't planning on it, no. That's pretty weak. Uh, okay, yeah. You want to go home? We can go back to your place, I guess. I'm sorry, I need to ask this, you know, for clarity. Do you think this went well? Well... yeah. I mean, like, I'm a nine, right? And you're like, maybe, a six on a good day. So yeah, I thought it was a pretty sure bet. Really? Okay. Uh, wow. Um, so first off, I sat here and kept my mouth shut and indulged about an hour of your startup bro bragging bullshit about how you're saving the world delivering shitty beer to a bunch of hipsters living in apartments paid for by their parents. It's a stupid business idea, and frankly, it's not giving back to the community. They can just walk to the fucking store. And second off, you're like an eight, all right? Okay, at best. So just fucking get over yourself. Look, okay. That's pretty harsh, babe. And don't fucking call me babe. Relax, sweetie. Why don't we just go back to my place? -We'll have a drink. -Seriously? Yeah. Let's go. You, you don't get it, all right? You are a walking example of everything that is wrong with this world. I would gladly push you off a cliff before I slept with you. So you can just go home, turn on some weird Japanese porn and literally fuck yourself. And also, what the hell kind of rich guy tips ten percent? Whoo, cuckoo. Must be that time of the month, you know what I mean? Welcome, ladies and gentlemen! It's your favorite host here. And it is so, so great to be with you tonight. Thank you, thank you, yeah. Now you all know that I love to joke around. I'm a jokester. But tonight I've got to talk to you about something very serious. I know, I know. But today we are going to discuss something called... simulated reality. To explain, let's go to my colleague in the field. The basic concept of simulated reality is exactly what it sounds like. A manufactured version of reality, which is in fact not real. In our case, a highly developed race have used advanced computing technologies to create simulations full of generations of people living entire lifetimes under the impression that their worlds are in fact real. Now why would they do this, you might ask. In our example, this advanced race is looking back into their past to determine how different variables might have impacted their development. A way to understand all of a world's possible alternate histories. And now, back to you in the studio. How about that? Yes, it's truly amazing. And it's my duty today to inform you that your world, your entire existence, is just one of those billions upon billions of simulated realities created by humans of the future. Isn't that something? Now I know this sounds a little out there, and you could use some proof. So I'm gonna give you some proof. It's what I'm here for. You are all now holding a banana. That's stupid. Holy fucking what? I hope you're still with us. - Please. enjoy that banana. - It's good for you. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end, and it's with a heavy heart that I notify you that your simulation will be discontinued exactly one week... From now. Yes, it's too bad. It is really a shame. In accordance with the Simulated Consciousness Act of 3112, all sentient inhabitants must be made aware of the nature of their existence before the termination of a simulation, which means you are getting provided with a wonderful, wonderful choice. To see what it is, let's check in with some friends of mine. You know, we've got some really great stuff for you tonight. Some really great stuff. So first up is Option A. You remain here in the abandoned simulation without any outside influence. That's right. Everything's up to you. That sounds like a hard life if you ask me. But legally, we do have to offer it. Now, what most of you are going to be interested in is Option B. We take your consciousness and we transfer it to a simpler, more efficient system, where you get to relive your five greatest memories over and over without any kind of awareness. That's right. Pure bliss, forever. Thank you, folks. Oh, I told you, we're doing everything we can to take care of you. Now I know this is a lot, it is. But I have just one more surprise for you. Just one more. Each and every one of you is going to get your own personal Guide. This Guide will answer your questions. This Guide will make sure you have everything that you need to move on to your next phase, whatever you choose. It has been wonderful being here with you tonight. I do wish you all the best. Ooh, your Guides will be arriving any moment. Please have a wonderful night and I'll see you real soon. Hello. -Hi. -May I come in? So... You're the guy from the TV? Yes and no. I look like the guy from the TV. Okay. I'm an artificial intelligence program. So are you... well, you're more mellow than the TV guy. I look like the host to make it easier for you to process. But my program has been tuned to your specific personality profile to aid you in the discontinuation process. Makes sense. This all makes sense. Cool. Cool. I was being sarcastic. Whatever. Do you have any other questions? You can ask me anything you want. Uh... no, I think I've got all this sorted, thank you. Fantastic. Just in case, I am going to remain here until you make a decision. Uh... No, no, no. That's really, that's okay. It is our standard procedure. -Do I get a say in this? -No. But why would you not want free help? That's a reasonable question I've never had a good answer for. I guess privacy was the big thing. But if all the shit you're saying is true, none of that matters anyway. Exactly. So we all have to deal with you or some version of you. That is correct. Won't it get kind of chaotic having twice as many people in the world? What do you mean? Right. People will only be able to see and hear their own Guides. We have done this before, do not worry. You've done this before? How many times? Would it make a difference? Yeah. No? Maybe. I don't know. Um... Okay. Well, I guess I'm just gonna go to bed and hope that this is all a dream. I'm guessing you're just going to be here? That is correct. Do you want to sleep on the couch? I do not require food or sleep. Uh-huh. That makes sense, I guess. So you're just gonna sit here till morning? That is correct. 114,225,700,604. What? That is how many times we have done this before. Or at least that is how many times my program has been used. Uh-huh. Great. Well... make yourself at home. Or whatever. And I guess, good night? Good night. Everyone's getting so worked up about this, but... is it really that much of a surprise? I mean, if anything, I feel like it explains a lot. And it actually makes me feel a little better. I mean, I'm not going to pretend the last few days haven't been weird as shit, but... I don't know, I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that's still acting... kind of normal. Sort of a weird reversal to suddenly feel like the sane one. I guess if I never really had control over anything, none of this, whatever is wrong with me, was my fault. Maybe you were right. Maybe I can stop worrying about the things that I can't control because apparently no one in the entire world has ever had control over anything. Right. Yeah, that sounds good. Were you listening to any of that? No. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm just a little preoccupied. I can tell. Whatever happened to not worrying about what you can't control? You used to tell me that like five times a session. Of course I did. But that was back before every single thing in our existence was a lie. And just because I said it doesn't mean... You don't know my... Weren't you going to kill yourself anyway? -Uh... -They've given you an out. You don't have to do it anymore. They, whoever the fuck "they" are, will just do it for you and then send you into some never-ending fantasy loop. It's bullshit! You've got it easy. The rest of us, those of us who actually give a shit about life, are being, I don't know, just a little bit fucking inconvenienced. I mean, at least we're getting an easy choice, sure, but still, just busting into our lives and telling us we have to choose in the first place? We shouldn't have to deal with that shit! So you're going with Option B? Of course I am. Interesting. Not really sure what I'm gonna do yet. Oh? Now that is funny. I don't know that it was supposed to be. It's just so you. Easy choice, but you have to make it complicated. There's no way in your mind that the rest of the world could be right. -I just-- -What is it with your generation, anyway? You spend all of your time complaining about how we boomers need to shut up and stop telling you what to do and that we don't understand. But then, you come to places like this, to pay people like me to tell you what you're doing wrong, and you still don't listen! I don't think I've ever really said it out loud before, but you are just a bunch of self-absorbed, know-it-all assholes! It's exhausting. Uh... I can't fucking believe this is happening! What was the point of it all? By the way, what are you doing here? I'm not even seeing patients. I'm just in here trying to get my shit in order. You barged in and started talking like everything was normal. This is the last thing I need right now. Oh. Well, I guess I just thought... Well, in that case, I should probably go? Yeah, probably. Same time next week? There won't be a next week. And I can't believe I wasted all the weeks I did have on fuckups like you. Right, okay. So bye, then? Fuck off. Leave a check! The co-payment is 40 dollars! Did everything go well? Fuck! I think maybe we should give him some space. Here's your Red Eye. Thank you. I really needed this today. You know, I was actually amazed to see you guys were still open. -What do you mean? -I don't know. I just kind of figured no one would want to go to work anymore. I didn't. Wait. So you just stopped going? Yeah. I mean, it's not like they're sending out paychecks anymore. Hmph. So how many people usually end up staying? I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that accurately. It varies from simulation to simulation, but it is usually a very small number. Most who choose to stay do not see another person, at least those who do not stay with family or a partner. But people rarely stay together. Finally, my chance to be left alone. -Perhaps. -It sounds so nice. You can make that choice if you think it is right for you. Ooh, I have a funny question. So if you've done this a bunch of times, have you met another version of me? I am sorry, I cannot answer that. Oh come on, why not? I am here to help you make your decision, but it might create excess bias if you knew. So you have met another version of me. You cannot trick me into answering. Okay, okay. I read you loud and clear. I did not say anything. Oh, it's Kayla. She wants me to meet her in the park. She's been so flaky the last couple of days. All right. Oh, do you want anything to go? I do not require food or-- I know, I'm just fucking with you, come on. The fuck? Hey Kay. What's with the jumpsuits? Sarah! It is so wonderful you are here. Bless the creators. This is my new friend, Otto. Otto, this is my best friend from our journey through this world, Sarah. Hi, Otto. Bless the creators or whatever she said. Oh, I'm good, thank you. So who are these creators? They are those that have created all of this. It is also through their mercy that we will live on through the infinite. They are great. Bless the creators! Okay, cool. Join us in our praise of their greatness. I think I'll pass, thanks. Did he brainwash you? Are you good? I have never felt better in my entire existence. Can't argue with that. Um, so what does your Guide have to say about this? Doesn't he know all about the creators? He is my direct connection to them. We are in a deep, complex, committed relationship. We are one and because of him, I'm one with the creators. It is highly erotic. She is definitely making that part up. Well, I've got to say, you guys seem really busy over here, so I'm just going to go. Is that okay with the creators? They have granted you free will, and you are free to do with that as you wish. Except they haven't, though, because like all this shit, we're living in a simula... You know what? It's fine. Why don't you just let me know when you need a break from dancing in the park or whatever is happening here? See you later. I'll see you later as well, as we relive our greatest moments together in the boundless expanse... beyond time. Right. Sounds like a plan. -Does that always happen? -Yes. - Every time? - Yes. Some people need it to wrap their heads around the unknown. Huh. Nothing new there. My God, it's nice to be home. Everyone's losing their shit out there. We always anticipate a wide array of reactions to the news. Yeah, I think I'm going to like the world a lot better without other people. Perhaps. It is difficult to make it out there on your own. People tend to struggle without other people. Dude, the hardest part of my life right now is dealing with other humans. I think I'll be okay. Oh, shit. My mom called like five times. She's probably making sure everything's okay. Hey, Mom, saw you called a few times. - Everything good? - Everything's fine. Well, it's mostly fine. It's okay. I just thought it would be nice if you were able to come by. - Now? -Yeah. Come over for lunch. Are you sure everything's okay? Yeah. I mean... your dad is, well, you can imagine. -Is he all right? -Yeah. He's just dealing with things in his own way. But I think it would be nice if you could come by. It would mean a lot to him and to me. Please? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um... I'll just get ready and I'll head over in a few. Great! See you in a bit. Okay, so final warning. My parents can be weird. We literally had a whole conversation about this on the car ride over here, I consider myself warned. -There's my dumpling. -Jesus Christ! -What? -Why the hell aren't you wearing pants? -Why would I? -What the fuck, Dad? Gary! Did you answer the door without clothes on again? Let me live my life, woman! Gary! Nobody wants to see that. I don't want to see that. That's why we leave the lights off. Goddamn it! You know, you married me. Go put some clothes on! Baby, we don't have time for clothes anymore. Go, go! -Hey, Mom. -Hi, sweetie. Come on in. Sorry about your father. You know, he can go a little overboard with things. That image will haunt my dreams. Well, come on down to the kitchen. I'm just finishing up. Oh, some week, huh? Yeah, I don't think I've heard anyone be so casual about it, but I guess you could say. Actually, you don't have to pour me one. Oh shoot! I'm so sorry, I forgot. You're still not drinking? Yeah, It's been six months. Not sure it's done me any good, but... Anyway, you were saying, some week. Hmm. You know, it is what it is. You know, I go with the flow. Your father is having a tougher time of it, though. Yeah, I didn't notice. Oh, he'll be fine. It's probably better he only had a week. You don't want him analyzing things too much. Mmm! Gary, get down here. Two minutes! I know you worry about him. He worries about you, too. How are you doing, anyway? Pretty good, actually. Uh-huh. Well, I'm not sure I believe you, but if you say so. No, really. Well, good, great. We'll have a wonderful meal then. Nothing to worry about. Gary! Food! When I talked to you last week, you were about to go on a date. How did it go? Does it matter anymore? Well, no, but... unless you're going to get married in the next three days. Is he the one? No, Mom. He most definitely was not. Oh, that's too bad. Did you still have fun? - Nope. - Did you... Can we talk about something else please? I don't mean to pry, I just-- Goddamn it! Will you please shut the fuck up? Did we say something wrong? Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's just my Guide. He has been yelling all morning. And I finally got fed up so I just, sorry. Please, go on. Why was he yelling? I locked him in the basement. You locked him in the basement? Yeah, I got tired of him talking all the fucking time. You know, you can send them away when you make your decision, right? Yeah, and that's what they say. But I don't want them to know what I'm thinking. I have to keep them on their toes. So you locked him in the basement? Seemed a little more humane than the shed. Well, mine's very nice and very handsome, too. I think your father is jealous. I don't know why we need them in the first place. I mean, the decision is pretty obvious. I mean, who wants to turn down permanent pleasure for more of this shithole? Well, actually, I was thinking about staying. Oh really? That was a good one, honey. I love you. But I mean, you really couldn't get your shit together before all this went down. How do you think you're going to do it without somebody taking care of you, huh? Wha--? What the fuck was that Gary? We don't have time for anything other than honesty. That's your daughter! Go apologize. I stand behind what I-- -Now! -Right. Couldn't they have ended the world when it was a little cooler out? Probably didn't factor the weather in. Right. Sorry. -I didn't mean to be... -No, that's fine. I get it. I do. You don't have to say anything. We all have to do what's best for ourselves, and we don't have to agree on what that is. I know I can be a little critical. But you know that's just because I want what's best for you, right? I know. Are you sure you want to stay? Yeah. It's weird. I feel like I'm the only person on the planet that feels more normal now that I know that we weren't in control. Once everyone else is out of here, I can start living my life my way, without weird future people dictating everything I do. Do you really think we had no control? I can't imagine they put that much effort into making billions of these simulation things just to let us run amok. Did you ever ask your Guide why they're ending it? No. You should. Why, do you know? I don't. Honestly, I really don't care. But I think you should know if you're going to stay based on that. It just sounds like they got what they needed, and it's time to wrap it up. But what were they looking for? Again, I don't care. I think it's a great way to go and I'm ready to take it. But if I were you, I wouldn't want to make the decision without knowing all the facts. I mean, for all we know, this world is defective, and you'll be stuck here all on your own while it falls apart. I'm just being honest. Would they really end this if it was good enough to keep? I'm gonna go back inside. You come in whenever you're ready. I know your mom would like to spend more time with you. We're so happy you came over, sweetie. Yeah, I'm glad I came too. I didn't think this is how we'd be saying goodbye. Well, I'll come back. We still have a few more days. -Actually, we're gonna... -Remember how we were supposed to go to Fiji for our 30th? We decided we should still go. Why not spend what little time we have left in paradise? Wow. I completely forgot about that. - I guess I just assumed... - I know. I was surprised people were flying as well. I guess the pilots had the same idea as us. And it's not like getting a refund is any help at this point. Well, wow, that sounds... nice, that sounds really nice. I'm happy for you guys. Thanks, sweetie. So... this is it. Yeah, I guess it is. Okay. Well, I love you guys. I wish you could stay, but I want you to live your lives. We love you, too. And we are so proud of you for always being yourself. Hey, good luck. I know you'll make the right choice for you. Oh Dad, can you do me a favor? Of course. Wear pants on the plane. You know, for Mom? Will do. Okay. Oh, it's okay. You're right, they're pretty interesting people. -I guess that I could have-- -Why is our simulation ending? It has served its purpose. We are reallocating resources to other simulations. Okay, then what was its purpose? Every simulation is designed to test a specific variable's impact on the world. Sometimes the sky is a different color. Sometimes snow is warm. Some are permanent. Others are temporary. What was our variable? The great auk. What the shit is that? A flightless bird. What? A penguin. -A penguin? -Yes. A fucking penguin. Not a singular penguin. A species of penguins. All righty then, where are these penguins? They lived in the North Atlantic, but they're all gone now. Hunted to extinction in the middle 19th century. Then why is this just ending now? We want to see a variable's impact on the world, but also the impact of its absence. Great. Fucking penguins ended the world. More accurately, the presence of the penguins was the reason for the world. Absence of them is the reason for the end of the world. It was us. Come again? It was us all along. It was our fault. We were in control. We destroyed the variable. We ended the world. In a manner of speaking, yes. We're really ending it for you. Although you did give us reason to. That said, we are also responsible for the creation of the world in the first place. We're also essentially you of the future, except not in a simulation. It's all very complicated. It's all just as fucking pointless as before. -Yes, but-- -Get out. What? Get out of the car. I don't want to see you anymore. I've made up my mind. I can't stay in this world. - But-- Get out! All right. I'll still be keeping an eye on you. If you change your mind, I'll know. Good luck, Sarah. Fuck! Hi. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, totally fine. Okay, good, good. If you say so. I guess we're all totally fine right now. Sorry, you just caught me off guard. I didn't think anyone would see me like this. Oh, it's fine. I'll let you get back to it. I just wanted to give you one of these. An end of the world party? Everybody's going at once, so why don't we have some fun and all go together? A little weird. Yeah, well isn't all this a little weird in like a cosmic sense? Okay, you win. Right on. Starts at eight on Friday, obviously ends at midnight. All right. Well, I gotta finish passing these out. I'll see you then. Hey, Mom, just checking in. You guys are probably already on the plane, um... And I don't even know if you're going to have service down there. But I figured I'd try anyway. I... uh... kind of wish I had gone with you guys. I probably would have said no if you'd asked. So I understand why you didn't. I just, um... I don't really know what to do with myself now. You know? Yeah, you're probably not even going to get this. But If you do... I miss you. Say hi to Dad for me. I love you guys. Barry? You all right? Yeah, I'm great. Just taking in the sky one last time. This is it, you know? Yeah, I guess it is. Well, at least now we all know there wasn't a point. Of what? Everything. Life. Is this even life? I don't think I have the qualifications to answer that. You know, back when I worked on Wall Street I thought I had everything figured out. I was happy because I thought I was a success. But that was based on whatever I thought the world was. And then that changed. I changed, and it changed again. What we think, we become. What? -Buddha. -Right. Um, well... maybe what's happening now is the point. Maybe it is about where we go next. Does it even matter where we go? I mean, we're here and then we aren't. We can't get to wherever is next on our own, you know, so no matter what, we gotta go along for the ride, man. And then you know what? We all wind up in the same place anyway. I always thought it would be the aliens that took me away, but I guess this will have to do. Oh. See you at the party tonight? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Far out. Far. Out. Hey Kay. Um, give me a call back when you can. I know that you're into whatever you're into now, but I wanted to see if maybe you wanted to hang out tonight. I, I'm not doing too well. I'm actually, I'm pretty lonely. I'm even thinking about going to a party tonight. Figured you'd come over just to see that happen. I really don't want to go alone. So... give me a call. Hey! Ooh, look at you. Oh, goddamn it. You again. What are you doing here, babe? Don't... Ugh, I don't know. I'm just here. What are you doing here? You know, sniffing around for some ladies. Figured the end of the world would leave them wanting to get pretty weird. -Of course. -How about you, babe? Do you not remember how our date ended? Hmm, I do, but I'm very persistent. You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. -Thought I was a six. -You are. But ooh, you are looking good tonight. I just might make you an honorary seven for the end of the world. -Jesus, you're a shithead. -Come on. It's not like you're gonna do any better with the time you got left. What did I do to deserve this? -What do you got to lose? -Fuck off! All right, well, you know where to find me when you change your mind. Huh? Huh? Okay. Hey Kay, I'm really glad you're here. Hello? Is anyone home? Are you on something? Shit. Hey everybody! Less than a minute! Less than a minute! It's hard to see how lost you are, till you find your way back again. I spent so many years fighting who I was, then a bunch more trying to deal with the lack of identity that came from that. I tried so hard to be someone that people liked that I stopped being anybody at all. It's been a long road, but... but I finally feel like myself again. I almost forgot what that felt like. It was euphoric, you know? I actually thought something was wrong. But then I realized that... this must be what it feels like to not be buried by anxiety and depression 24 hours a day. The lows are actually offset by highs, instead of lows and slightly better lows. I know I gave you a hard time. But you're right. It is a process. And I'm glad I stuck with it because I'm finally putting the work in and I'm really starting to see the results. Same time next week? -Hey! -Fuck! Holy shit! It's you. Fuck... Do you remember me? It's Tucker. Unfortunately, I do. -What the hell are you doing here? -Awesome! This is so rad! I haven't seen anyone in two years. Well, I figured you would have gone out with everyone else. I mean, the last I saw you was at the end of the world party. No, it wasn't really my thing. I'm kind of all about living in the present and not repeating the past. That's a surprisingly good answer. I kind of regret it, though. There's not really any chicks here, so... -There it is. -I'm kidding. I'm kind of surprised you didn't go. And you can go right back to thinking I didn't. Wait, wait. We should stick together or something, you know? I can't imagine you wanna be alone. -I'm good. -You sure? I mean, it's just the two of us. I know I've been lonely. I was actually doing really well here before you showed up. Where have you been, anyway? I brought a couple of chicks back to my apartment in the city, and then I just stayed. The city's not really fun though without all of the people. And I got tired of walking up the stairs. So I came out here. I'm not really sure what I was trying to find. Well, it's really not that much better up here. So maybe you should just go back. We're here now, we should probably make the most of it. -Gotta go. -Hey, hey. I just can't believe I ran into you. You know, we should hang out tomorrow. I can't hear you. Bye. I'll come and find you in the morning. Huh. Good morning! What are you doing here? I told you I'd come find you today. Look, I got a pair of wheels so I can keep up with you. Seriously? Yeah, let's go. You really can't take a hint, can you? What do I have to lose, right? Hey! Where are you going? Help! Looks like nice, clean water. The river water I was drinking in the city was fucking gross. Blech. You know, I didn't expect to find anyone when I came back here. Yeah, if only that had actually discouraged you. Honestly, I was just really excited to see you. So sorry if I came on a little strong. It's been lonely, you know? I'm an extrovert. So this whole thing has been pretty hard on me. Maybe I should've went with everyone else. I wish you did. Wow, that's a pretty shitty thing to say. Yeah, well, consider it fair payback for being such an asshole to me before. You're seriously not over that? Come on, I have had some time to realize I was a little bit of a dick, but you're not even capable of forgiving the one person left in the world to forgive? No. I'm not. It's like I said when we met. You're the embodiment of everything that was wrong with our world. I can't even look at you without being reminded of how miserable I used to be. I forgave myself for not living my life. That was hard enough. I don't need you here to remind me of the world that made me that way in the first place. Look, I'm glad you feel better about yourself. I really am. But if you've grown up, how do you know I haven't too? Because you don't want to. You're too in love with yourself to care about changing. Maybe you're not as good at reading people as you think you are. That's hilarious coming from you. I'm not done, okay? I'm aware I was an asshole. I know what I did. I remember what I said. I mean that whole persona that you hated so much, just a character I created to mask a giant stack of insecurities. I wanted people to like me. So I figured the best way to get them to think I was cool and confident was to treat them like shit. And you know what's funny is it actually worked. So I kept doing it. I've had a lot of time to think and I can finally admit how toxic it all was. Meanwhile, you're just as judgmental and selfish as you were before. I get you might not want me here, but maybe you should get off your high horse of bitchery and look in the fucking mirror. Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Sarah! Sarah, come back. Excellent. Sarah! Sarah, I'm really sorry. -Let me carry one of those. -Just leave me alone. I swear, I can be useful if you just let me. No! I have everything under control. I was doing just fine on my own. Please, there's got to be something I can do. -I'm fine. -Just let me help you. -Let me give you a hand! -You don't listen to me! -Hello. -Hi. I'm just here to sell you some solar panels. I've had my eye on you. Really? There aren't that many of you left, so we like to check in from time to time. How many? 246,922 worldwide. Bet that sounds like more than it is. Yes, it does. It seems you've had it rough the last few days. Yeah. Are you okay? I think it's pretty clear that I'm not. I know. Who would have thought I'd care about that creep? People, real ones and simulated ones alike, are programmed to care about each other. You just forgot that because society had trained you to think otherwise. In plain terms, people need people. I don't know. Before, everyone just left. Poof. I was here by myself and everything was great. That douchebag, I fucking hated him. But... seeing him... dead, there on the ground... it all became real. After two years of feeling more alive than I've ever felt, reality came crashing in and suddenly I was more alone than I ever thought possible. Before I was able to live like this whole world was mine. But now I can't go anywhere without being reminded of what we used to be. if it makes you feel any better, he is with everybody else now. Really? Everyone goes to the same place in the end. Do you want to stay here? I made my choice, and it's my responsibility to live with it. If you like, I can send you to where everyone else is. You can do that? Everyone who stays will eventually choose to go. We just have to let them come to that decision in their own time. I don't think I can do this anymore. It's okay. Why did I think I could make it on my own? You did. You were on your own for two years. But that's a lot for any one person. You know, it's funny. People would say that suicide was the easy way out. It pissed me off hearing that because most people have no idea the kind of pain it takes to get to that point. But I am just now realizing that I judged everyone that left for taking the easy way out. But I couldn't do it. I guess easy is all relative. Everyone's struggle is different. I know. So what do you think? I think... I'm ready. I understand. But can I just have the rest of the day here for myself, just to take it all in? Of course. I'll come by tomorrow morning. Thanks. And I'm sorry. You were only there to help me and I shouldn't have treated you that way. Don't worry about it. At least you didn't lock me in the basement. Do you remember when you asked me if I had met another version of you? Yeah, you wouldn't tell me. I know. I couldn't then. So? I have met roughly 321,000 versions of you. They're all a little bit different, but they are all you. I couldn't tell you before because not all of them choose to stay. And I didn't want to let that influence your decision. In fact, a lot of them are a little bit quicker with the pills than you were, and they never get to hear the truth in the first place. Those that do stay tend to not last very long. Of all the Sarahs, you've made it the farthest. You are the strongest and most true version of yourself. No matter what you think or how you feel right now... you've done great. I'll see you tomorrow.
