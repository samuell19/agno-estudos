I got that from 75 feet away, Elvis Costello. That guy's like a musical genius. Got the black and white first, then I switched to color before he got time to put on his fuckin' hat. All right, how many shots you see of Elvis Costello without his hat? That's a rarity. - It's cool. - Hey, hey, hey, don't touch that, man, what are you doin'? That's a collector's item, oh Christ. - I'm sorry. Sorry. - That's your covers, all right? Like I said, this ain't a hotel. - No, this is perfect, man. Thank you, I really appreciate it. - What are you, like homeless or what? - I'm movin' around right now. Think I could be an actor, I'm tryin' to be an actor. - Oh, well. Toby, the most important thing I could say to you right now... - Yeah? - Don't touch anything. (speaks Spanish) - Yeah, good night. (door thuds shut) (door creaks) (serene ambient music) (funky music) (Toby hums) (machine rattling) - [Les] Hey! What are you doin'? - Oh hey, man. I fixed your bike. The chain fell off. - Why's it so hot in here? - I got your radiator workin'. The valve was stuck. It was painted shut. It was kind of a bitch but I got it off. Then I took a shower. I hope you don't mind. I unclogged your drain. The water's draining good now. - What the fuck are you talkin' about, man? - What? - You think I'm gonna pay you for this shit? - Oh no, man, I'm just returnin' the favor. All right, I'm gonna get outta here. I'll see you around. - See ya. - Thanks. Hey, I was wonderin', do you ever need anybody, you know, to like help out or? - Nope.

Totally free, man. - This room is off limits unless I'm here, all right? - Okay. - Rule number one, no lookie, no touchie. This is the nerve center of my business and I don't want you screwin' it up by playing solitaire or jerkin' off on the internet. - No problem. Go with the flow. That's pretty funny with the mouse. - Yeah, get it here, we got work to do. Here's your first job. Clean out this closet. All right? - [Toby] Okay. - Man, half this stuff, I don't even use anymore now that I've gone digital. You know, I could just take shot, email it around the world in 10 seconds. You ever hear that, shot 'round the world? - [Toby] That's Eminem, right? - Eminem, what the fuck is wrong with you? It's a famous saying, shot heard 'round the world. That's what I'm aimin' for. - Yeah. Sorry, you're gonna throw away some of this junk or? - No, hey. This is a collector's item. My old man gave this to me. Happen to be very close to him. - What about this? - No, it's my book. - Oh. - Startin' next week, I'm gonna take this around to all the agencies, you know, get that high end work, Nike, Ralph Lauren. - So you're not gonna be a paparazzi anymore. - I told you, I'm not a paparazzi. I'm a licensed professional. - M'kay. - Rule number one, there are players and there are peons. I happen to be a player. All right, I got nothing against the paparazzi 'cause without them this whole celebrity game would crumble like a fuckin' house of cards. Who buys the pictures? - Yeah, right. - No, I'm asking you a question. Who buys the pictures? - Oh, the magazines buy the pictures. - Magazines, okay, who buys the magazines? People, why? To see the stars. Magazines get rich, the stars get famous, all because I get a shot of K'Harma kissing her boyfriend. - Oh, you got a picture of that? - No. I almost did thought, except some asshole tipped them off. - Fuckin' asshole. - Know what I did get, got a shot of Goldie Hawn eatin' lunch. - Wow. Goldie Hawn, man. - Yeah, very classy lady, and still sexy as shit, I might add. - Yeah, I want her autograph. - Yeah, well, autographs are for peons. Try it out, get in.

Cold coffee one more fuckin' time, - Sorry. - And you're out of here. - I told you. - You were right. - He's incredible, right? - Where does this kid come up with this stuff, he's awesome. - He's the real thing. I mean come on, look at that face. That's the closeup, you need to go tight like that, right? That's the closeup you need. There you got a show. (funky jingle) Hey, I'm Toby, I play "Toby". Well, I mean, I used to be homeless, so I think that's why they picked me for this job. So I know, I know Toby pretty well. Well, I had some experiences with violence, but right now I'm just trying to go where the lights are green, you know? - It's a reality series show, about a serial killer. He's also a homeless kid. Make a hip cast, there's all the people in it, or who they are. Like life, like O.J.. Did that really happen, or was it another reality show? Think about that. (upbeat funky jingle) - The challenge of the casting was finding people who are what they are, but who also have that star quality. Our lead, forget about it. He really has it. He has such a bright, bright, bright future. (upbeat funky jingle) - Hey, I'm Toby, I play "Toby". Well, I mean I used to be homeless, so I think that's why they picked me for the job. Right now I'm just trying to go where the lights are green, you know? - Christ, now he's stealing my lines! I should sue him for plagiarism. At least get a writing credit. (solemn music) (screaming) - [Dana] I'm his manager, you can tell me. Mhmm, what's the offer? Huh. Well he's tied to Slice for another three months. Wait, wait, can you hold on for a second? Hello? No, no, no, Premier does not get the profile, unless he has a full page. Okay, you got that? Call me back. All right, and, (groans) hold on for a second. Hello? No, that's T-O-B-Y, no "E". Yes, he's 20 years old, the scar is real, he got it in Central Park, fighting off a pack of wild dogs, okay, thank you. Randoline, yes, no listen baby. The offer is fine, all right, it's fine. The only problem I'm having is the female lead. No, I'm sure she's completely delightful, but her star is nowhere near Toby's orbit. Mhmm, yeah, well tell Ridley we appreciate the offer, we'll consider it, and that's plus 10%. Thanks baby, bye. Cheers. Did you have a nice shower? - Yeah, your hot water is amazing. - [Dana] Yeah? - Yeah. It really is. - Ooh, look at you, your skin, it's all tingly. - And I fixed your shower head. - Did you? - Mhmm. Uh oh. You know, I told you, you can't keep walking around my apartment without any clothes on. There are windows. (jazz music) I knew you would clean up good. Look how beautiful you are. (upbeat feminine music) - [Byron] What's so great is that K'Harma designed this scent, all by herself. - [Gabi] She came up with the whole thing by herself. - She went to the lab, she picked out all the different smells to put together... - She came up with the bottle, thanks to you guys, the color... - And the name. - Instant K'Harma, which is like so great, sui generis, it's Instant K'Harma. - It invokes desire, and sex... - And sexiness, and... - 'Scuse me. - [Gabi] She'll be right back, I know she wants to talk to you about cosmetics... - What are you doing here? - (Inhales loudly) I came to smell you. - So where's Mystique? - I love the single, it's hot. - I know, I know it's hot. It's not about you, you know. - I know. I don't think about you anymore, either. You look beautiful, baby, really beautiful. I do miss you, babe. - Really? - Every day, every night. Especially at night. How about you? You miss me? - No. - Not even just a, just a tiny little bit? - No. - I know you do, baby. Baby. (flash) - Oh yeah? You fucking asshole, shut the fuck up. Shh, Toby. Will you just take this guy, he won't even shut up. He's been calling for a week. - No, I don't wanna take it. - You have to take this call, man. I'm gonna freak out. Most annoying human being I've ever. - Yeah. - Hey, hey, how you doing? Is that really you? Oh my god. - What do you want? - I'm just calling to say hi, man. You know, I mean I saw you on TV, wow, you were great. - What the fuck do you want, Les? You're fucking harassing everybody. - Okay, look, I just I just think maybe we should get together, you know. Try to work this out, man. Because it's like you said, man. Rule number one, friends is friends, right? - No, no, no, no, rule number one, rule number one, you lied to me, Les. Rule number two, you're a fucking paparazzi. - Come on, don't say that. - That's what you are, what, do you think you're different? That's what you are, Les, you're a fucking paparazzi, paparazzi. - All right, all right, watch this. - [Toby] You sneak around, you take pictures of people, and then you lie about it. You fucked the whole thing up, Les. - You think I'm a paparazzi, okay, watch this. I'm gonna delete the whole thing, okay? Here I go. (jingle) All right? - Okay, all right, yeah, you're deleting them. - I did it, I swear to God. They're gone. - Like I'm gonna believe you, I could believe you now, right? 'Cause right now you're telling the truth, right? - You tell me you believe me, or I'm gonna fucking stab myself in the throat, I got a knife to my throat, right now! - All right, look, Les, look, just calm down Les, calm down, okay? - Just tell me you believe me! - Look, just calm down, calm down! I believe you, I believe you, all right? I believe you. - Thank you. - Look man, you fuckin' locked me in your house. - Hey, are we gonna focus on the negative, or can we move on to the positive, all right? Come on, I was just calling to say how happy I am for you. You're doing great, man. I started you off, isn't that crazy? (laughs) I mean, you never would have met that casting chick, if it wasn't for me, right? Are you still there? - Yup. - Look, how about if we just get together and just have a beer, all right? What do you say? Or you know, go to Cheeks and we'll have a cup of coffee, all right? - No. (beep) - Tob. (somber music) - You're such a totally awesome guy, Toby. - Wow, thanks. - Ever since Blaine died, you've taught me so much about being homeless. It's kind of beautiful in its own way. - Yeah, it's got its ups and downs. - I was gonna say ins and outs. - Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut! - What, Corey? I'm going with it like you said. - Yeah, but come on, is this after-school porno? Is it? - No. - Look, tell him how you really feel, okay? - [Robbyn] I'm trying. - Be real for once. Just this one time. Okay? Be real. Sorry I yelled at you, all right? Just tell him. All right, go. Let go of my hand. - [Man] Back to one, right now, let's go, back to one, here we go. - Okay guys, keep rolling, keep rolling. Go. (somber music) - I love you, Toby. I love you so much. (funky jingle) - Yeah, I was pretty surprised when Robbyn said that. I mean, I think she's really pretty and fun, but you know, my true feelings are for someone else. Someone I met a while ago, who became very special to me, and I love her. She's a singer, I met her at the music awards. (upbeat modern music) ♫ So sophisticated, I'm such a zero. - Hi, baby. What you doing, sittin' here all by yourself? - Just thinking. - About me? - No, no, no. - Why? - You know why. - Trust me babe. - No. - I'm not gonna hurt you again. I love you. - I know, but you know, I can't do this... - I just, I can't stop thinking about all the things we used to do. (beep) - Yeah, I was pretty surprised, when Robyn said that, but my true feeling are for someone else. She's a singer, I met her at the music awards. - Remember how attached you were, babe. - Don't. - She was really nice to me, and I let her down. And I know she'll probably never forgive me, and I would like her to know that I'm sorry, and I know that I won't love anyone as much as I love her. I love you, K'Harma. I love you. - Oh my. - All right, can we stop now? Please, okay. - Toby. (beeping) (thud) - [Toby] I'm sorry. - How could you do that to me? You know how fucking humiliating that was? - [Toby] I didn't mean for that to... - What do you mean, you didn't mean, neh, neh, neh, mean. Shut the fuck up. You're such a dick! - I'm sorry, you've been so nice to me, and I... - I've been so nice to you, oh, I've been so nice to you, how nice. - No, but I mean you've been more than nice me, obviously... - I'm sure I have been more than nice, what exactly do you mean, what exactly do you mean by that? - I mean you're a really fucking special woman. - Ooh, I'm a fucking special woman, please. - And I'll never forget what you've done for me. - Yeah, I bet that that's true. - It's just not, look, it's just... - What? - She's just a little bit more... - A little bit more what? - I don't know, I mean, and you're a little bit more, you know... - What, what, I'm like a little bit more 35, and she's a little bit more 18 little Barbie doll ass... - No, that's not what I mean, you're putting words in my mouth. That's not what I mean. That's not what I'm saying. - That's not, sweetie, that is what you're saying, Toby. Why don't you just call a spade a spade. - Listen, I never wanted to hurt you. - Well. - I don't wanna hurt you. - Uh huh, just humiliate me? - Look, I'll pack my stuff and I'll go, okay? I'll get out of here. - Whatever you want. - I want you to be happy, that's what I want right now. So I mean, I'll pack everything up, and I'll get out of here. I'll find a place. - It's fine, just stay here until you find somewhere else. - Really? I mean, you sure? - Yeah, stay in the back room. - All right, all right, I'll move my stuff into the back room. And we'll just be like, living together. - Be like little roomies. - Like friends. - Yeah, well, let's go make up your bed. (jazz music) - Welcome back, this is Nicki Blake. Well, awards season is upon us, and already, hundreds of new films and stars are vying for those precious statues and... - I can't concentrate with the TV on. - What concentrate? Just pick up a card, you throw down, a monkey could play this game. - All right, hold on. - Like the Slice bad boy, Toby Grace made television history last night, by broadcasting his love of reigning pop diva, K'Harma. Sources close to the two are keeping mum, but it was evident at this post-awards party that sparks are beginning to fly between these two... - Hey, that's Feldman's photo. - Are we playing cards here, or what? - Yeah, we're playing. - For teenage fans outside the Slice studios in New York, the romance meter was off the charts. (girls screaming) - It was the most romantic thing I've ever seen, I love you Toby! I don't care if you're homeless! - As for the TV Romeo, he's keeping any further confessions close to the heart. - I mean, I appreciate it, but I wasn't trying to be romantic, you know? I was just, when you love someone, you gotta go with the flow. - Oh, that's original. - A.T. caught up with the object of his affections outside her Manhattan hotel. - All I can say is, I'm really, really touched. (people yelling out) - Wow, good for Toby, that's great. - Why is that great? - He was always a nice kid. - Really? He's a jerk. - What? Why do you say that? - 'Cause I know him. C'mon, I lived with him, right here. Know what he is? He's a back-stabbing, ungrateful leech. - No, really? - Oh my God, I could tell you stories, Ricco. I'll tell you what he did, he broke into my computer. - Broke into your computer? What was he looking for? - I don't know, bank records, account numbers, you know? Personal stuff, deeply personal. - He always seemed like a nice kid. - Why do you keep saying that? - 'Cause he did. He seemed like a nice kid. - I just told you, he wasn't. - I know. I guess I just, liked him. Really, really nice kid. (slam) - That's it, what the fuck is wrong with you, man? Get out! Get your cards, and get out. - I never seen you like this, man. You gotta chill, bro. Why you be buggin? - Why I be buggin? Why, because you can't stop talking about Toby this, toby that, he was a nice kid, blah, blah, blah, Feldman's photo. - [Ricco] All right. - Man, if you love the kid so much, why don't you marry him? Just get out, go. - Oh look, I'm sorry, was I talkin' about him that much? - No, just every fucking second. - Oh, man. - Bye Ricco, nice having you. - You're wrong, man. - Yeah, I'm wrong. (slam) (eerie music) - [Lois Flashback] Carl, wash your hands! - [Carl flashback] No, get it out of here, I don't want the fuckin' thing in the house! Where's that camera I gave you? - Oh, I still got it. Thanks Dad. Thanks for reminding me. 'Cause I got something coming up, something I could really use it for. Someone I know just dying to get his picture taken. Used to be a friend of mine. Mhmm, okay. You reach out to a guy, try to apologize, you say you're sorry, just trying to connect on a basic human level, and what does he say? - [Toby] No. - He says no. (hissing) No, Mr. Big TV Star, doesn't even wanna meet you halfway. Fine. (ominous music) Okay, what goes around, comes around, my friend. Rule number one, you don't mess with Les. Simple as that. You reap what you sow, you are what you eat. See what we got here. (eerie music) Pew, pew. (gunshot) (crowd screaming) - Listen, when we get inside, we go to E! first, then Access Hollywood, then EW, and it is absolutely critical we get that show with Clooney, and Del Toro. (ringing) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. - Hey, it's Gabi. We're gonna get out first. - What do you mean, you're gonna get out first? No, no, no, Toby gets out first. - Um, no Dana. K'Harma's gonna get out first, she's gonna get halfway up, and then Toby's gonna get out. - Exactly, Jesus. - No, Gabi. Toby gets out first, then she gets out, when he's a third of the way up. - Where is he, which car is he in? - Would you goddamn hurry up and get in front of them! - Fuckin' shit, goddamnit! - For fuck's sake! - Don't let them get in, do not let them get in first. - Dana, Dana, Dana! Hey guess what, cut the shit! - No, Gabi, you cut the fucking shit. - Her last album moved 10 million units. - Yes, plus foreign! - Oh, really. Well, he happens to be the lead in a 90 million dollar movie. - Why don't we just get out together? - No. - Shut. - You know why, 'cause she's a celebrity endorsee for Nova Cola, domestic, and international, including Taiwan! - Fine, she'll get out and then he's gonna get out when she's a quarter of the way up. - Love you, mean it. - It' so much better that you go out second, it's classier, it's much bigger. - Yeah, I don't care. - No, you should care, it's big, it means something. You've got to enjoy this moment, it's everything, this is everything we've been working for. - Get your coat on. - [Byron] C'mon. - Do a little this, mmm, mmm. Are you ready, Byron? - Yeah. - [Gabi] All right. - All right, let's go. - Yeah, I've got K'Harma right here, she's coming up. (crowd cheering) - K'Harma! Come on! (crowd screaming) (crowd screaming for Toby) - Toby, Toby, right here! - K'Harma, K'Harma, this is Sophie French, you'll talk to her for two minutes. - What's your name again? - Toby! - [Woman] Give us a smile, Toby. (peaceful music) - You don't wanna do this today. - [Gabi] K'Harma, no, no, don't do this now. - Hey, Homeless. (crowd cheering) (ominous music) - [Toby Flashback] That's what you are, Les, you're a fucking paparazzi. Paparazzi. Rule number one: friends is friends. - [Les Flashback] I gave you a job, I gave you a place to sleep! - [Toby Flashback] Go with the flow. - [Les Flashback] Go with the flow. Look, how about we just get together and have a beer, all right, what do you say? Like I'm some fuckin' peon all of a sudden? - [Lois Flashback] Wash your hands! - [Toby Flashback] You're a fucking paparazzi. - [Les Flashback] What did I say about De Niro? I said I would take you with me. Didn't I say that? I would take you with me! First chance you get, you fuckin' leave me! Like I'm a peon! Look at me! (crowd screaming) (poignant music) - Hey Les.
