Believe me, we have every reason to be optimistic. It is in the long term that we must concern ourselves with the development of our economy, even if this implies today difficulties for the workers. It is work for their children that we prepare by restructuring at the level of Europe and the world. You know, Marie Roche, my grandfather was a communist worker and my worries remain linked to my origins. It is necessary that the workers think this new situation with us instead of opposing the entrepreneurs according to old patterns. It is all together that we make a beautiful future for our children. Believe me. She is beautiful For her age. Fuck, the ass she had when I met her. - Do you remember? - Beautiful. Can you roll me a palot, like you did to José? And your wife, Jaco, she doesn't roll you any more? A woman like that, with fish lips? It's not just her lips that she has like a fish. Do you have something to say, Kraut? Are you getting angry, Jaco? I don't know... Do you know my wife ? Like that, like everyone else. - You fucked my wife ? - Hey, Jaco ! It's ok, Jaco. Stop it. What's with that guy, taking care of my wife? - But who's taking care of her? - Not me, precisely. It's okay, Otto. Laugh. She looks healthy, my wife. She's got blood like seawater. Come on, get in there. Damn it, Patrick! Holy shit. Excuse me. - He's heavy. - I don't care. - You're shitting us with your car. - I'm shitting you... - Come on, get in. - Where are you going? The bike, now? - No, it's okay now. - It's okay. Let's see it. Not to be touched. Roll up the window, Jose. He's going to vomit again. Walk a little. - Let go of me. - Come on. - Are you going to call him? - Yes. - Are you coming to see your father? - I don't feel like it. - Come on. I'll buy you a beer. Your sister's off to work. - Dad! -Oh fuck, again! Dad! Where have you been, again? But you know, Dad. At work, at last. There's José, who's here. Good morning, Dad. And Joséfa, isn't she here? No, she stayed at to close the cabaret. She's nice, Joséfa. I don't understand that a woman that nice would do that for you. She was already doing it when I knew her. It's her cabaret, Pa. - You're not married, are you? - No, we're not married. Because a married woman who shows her ass... Good! - How about a little beer? - I'm not finished. - What? - I'm not finished! - That's not true. - It's okay, leave it. He's not getting any better, the old man. - I'm not finished. - He'd be happier with people like him. Marie-Sol, why are you keeping him here? Because he's my father and yours. Have you forgotten? Kids, I won't have any. Yes. But, you two, shit! You've got to give me a nephew. Do you hear, Patrick? A boy or a girl, I don't care. If you want half and half, even, with the front of a boy and the back of a girl. Anything. As long as it hollers when it's hungry and laughs when you tickle its chin. That's it. Don't you understand that we are getting rusty? A kid, that keeps the old age. And then... - And then, we're old. - We're old, we're old... And yes, we are old. Look at us. A kid bouncing on his knees, it makes you do some gymnastics. You see, like this. Good. Shall we go? Stop bothering him with that, José! Fuck, a nephew, it's not the end of the world. Why don't you make one for us? Who do you want me to do it with? With Joséfa? Joséfa is old. You should have done it before. I know. What do you want? And you know that I'll be a good uncle. No? No? It's raining in Marseille. The port... Empty your pockets, quick! Oh, for fuck's sake. José? You're not going to pick up all the druggies in the neighborhood? What did you want me to do? Leave her in the creek? Drugged, but pretty, no? - I'll stop, José. - Go to bed. - I'll undress him. - No, I'll undress him. You're going to sleep. No, you're not undressing him. You're going to wake him up. - Go ahead. - Are you there? One, two, three! Marie-Sol? Stop for a moment, Marie-Sol. Sit down. - Would you like a coffee? - No, thanks. I've already had it. Sit down. You see, Marie-Sol, our arrangement can't go on. Why do you think that I don't work well? I pay attention to everything. Not at all, on the contrary. In fact, I'd love it if you could continue to take care of us. On the other hand, we're going to redevelop the park. The architect has planned to dig a swimming pool. In addition, I've heard that against fires, it's the best. The plans for the pool... Look. Here is the plan of the house as it is today. Do you understand? At the moment, you live here. Do you understand? In order to dig the swimming pool, the architect has to destroy the house. Don't worry, you have time to find something else. And then, as I am no longer providing you with accommodation, your salary will be increased. Let's say, I'm thinking... Let's say, 1500 francs. He can't fire us like that for a swimming pool. Why can't he? Do you have any papers? Did you sign anything? He said we'll have time to find something else. What does he want us to find? What are we going to pay rent with? With his 150,000 francs? He can just shove it up his ass, his 150,000. You don't have to wait. You don't want him to think that he can give you charity. Is he going to kick you out? Leave right away. You've got it. You've said a lot of things in your life. Talking for talking's no use. We don't have the money for rent, nothing. Besides, with Papa Carlos on our backs. If you want my father, I can throw him in the garbage. Who's talking to you about rent? Come here, we'll squeeze in. We'll be warmer. Isn't that right, Joséfa? In his pool, I'll put acid in it. That way, he'll come out with his ass all peeled. I'm hurting. I'm hurting. I'm hurting. I'm hurting. I'm hurting. Let's go, girls. Be careful, it's not yet... Hi, chicks. You smell like wine, Dad. Would you rather I smell like perfume or toothpaste? Go home. You too. - I love you. - Leave me alone. - I love you. - Stop it. - Come on. - Shut up. The little ones! Who cares about the little ones? What's the point of this bed, if it's not for fucking? Why did you make me buy it? Come on. I want to fuck. - Work first. - What? Work first. Do you think I'm not working on purpose? There is no work. Do you understand that? There's no work. There's no more work. Be careful with the carpet. It's wedged in there. - The trunk won't open like that. - Yes, you're right. Patrick, with your bike again! What's it to you if we put your bike in? In the other direction. Can't you follow us behind while pedaling? In the other direction. What the hell is this kid doing? Is he stupid or what? Don't you understand? It's okay! Calm down. I have to eat. No ? There are three million unemployed. Don't you read the newspapers ? Would you rather I stole your car ? Is that it ? You give me your money, I earn my living ! Finally ! Venus ! Venus ! - Here is your lover. - Go fuck yourself. Venus, come on! Come on! Quick. We'll miss the show. - Do you like it? - Yes. - Don't you have any today? - Yes, just now. - Are you quiet, then? - Do you have any in advance? - No. - Do you have enough money for it? - No. - Here. - Why are you doing this for me? - And you, why are you doing this? - Why would I stop? - Wait! - Let me touch you again. - Don't touch me, you big jerk! - Go to bed. I'll stop. I'm old and ugly. - I don't have an ass anymore. - Yes you do! Did you know that I dye my hair? You didn't know that. That's because I licked you too much. That's why. It's my fault. It's not you. That's life. If you stop, Joséfa, it's over. We'll close the doors. You're the soul of this cabaret. If you stop... I am an old skin. Go to sleep. Don't think about it. It's all bullshit. Besides, you look great. Can you feel the effect you're having on me? Do you think an old skin would have that effect on me? Come on. We'll have to make the bathroom door bigger. The chair won't fit. We've got other things to do. Don't you think? - Next time, you're the one who'll go. - I'll just shit more, that's all. - Will you get off your ass, Patrick? - Can you give us a ride? - No. That, no. - Excuse me, don't you want it? - Yes. - Should I take it or not? - Yes, take it. - It's not with what I earn, that I can buy stockings! So what? Why didn't you steal the bins too? - He's right, Jose. You're losing your marbles. - That's it. When we're honest, it's because we're losing our marbles. - It's okay. It's only 58 francs. - For stockings, it's too expensive. I'm going to put you in an asylum! And why don't you kill me too, like the old dogs with alopecia? If we had killed him, the other one there, when he made his coup d'état against the Popular Front, instead of sending him on vacation to the Canary Islands, we would never have had the war in Spain. Shut up! Three years of war, more than 1 million dead. - And why don't you want to kill me? - Because it's forbidden! That way, at least you wouldn't be asking me. Crazy! Why aren't we like that, quiet, without father or mother? Like flowers. Quiet! Good mother, I know I'm poor and stupid. You were too. Poor, not stupid. I know you've been through enough stupid and poor children. Idiots, especially. There are so many of them already. But, me, you know, a child, I'd like that. I'd like that so much. Maybe if you love him, he'll be smart. And if he's smart, he'll make a good living. I know I don't have to ask anything of you. You know what you have to do or what you shouldn't do. You already do so much for us. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with you. You are blessed among all women. And Jesus, the fruit of your womb is blessed. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. Thank you. Tomorrow, what are we going to do? The sewers, the dump? I saw a movie on TV. The guys they were robbing a bank with their kids. Thief. That's not my job, thief, I'm a foreman-craftsman. Forger! I'm a mechanic and he's a plumber. We're none of those things. We're all the same. We're screwed. Which way are you going? It's not the way. Let me do it. - The windows. - Right away, Commander. Have you ever seen a valve run in? No. Do you know that in order for the engine to run, there has to be an explosion? But, what is crucial, is that when the piston goes up for the explosion, it is absolutely necessary that these two valves are well closed. Otherwise, the compression is done badly and the engine doesn't run well. Do you understand? That's why, from time to time, it is necessary to run in the valves so that they close well. - It's easy. Do you understand? - No. - Do you want me to explain it again? - Yes. - Tell me, are you a ? No. Will you take me for a ride afterwards? - If you want. - Yeah! Explain your valve, now. OK, I'll start again. Joséfa! Give me your hand. Since when do you have to pay? Are you on credit too? Like the bed, the car, the house. Who wanted all this? I can fuck anywhere, I can eat anywhere and live anywhere. I hate this house. We needed to do like everyone else. Result at the end of the month, you have to pay, pay, pay! I didn't marry you on credit. I love you and I want to make love with you. Not with a whore I'd pay for it. You'll never touch me again. Do you understand? - You'll never touch me again! - Don't say that! - Loser! Missed! - Don't say that! - Sorry, darling. - I hate you. - Sorry. - You're nice. - Finally, why do you say that? - Sea urchins. - It's easy, that's all you like. - No, it's not easy to be nice. What's going on with you? I've been seeing you all day running around the house, since you lost your job. I see you pouting when my brother bothers you with his children's stories. There are some people, when they are unhappy, they become nasty. You stay nice. - You take care of my father. - Yes. But, there are days when... - You don't see the household money. - That's easy, there isn't any. And then, your brother gives me credit. You bring me sea urchins. You're nice. Maybe I'm still in love. Seeing you nice, it gives me courage. You'll see, you'll find a job and we'll have a child. I'm sure of it. You can believe me. You see, what I like most in the sea urchin, it's not what's inside. And what is it? It's that it has a mouth and above all, an ass. You really see asses everywhere. Are you enjoying it, Dad? In Spain, they're bigger. I like to see you laugh. It makes me want to live a little longer. Here, in Marseille, not in Spain. It costs us enough as it is. We'll cut you up into pieces and put you in a suitcase. No one sees you, no one knows you. That's funny. That's playing the kingpin and is afraid of death. Leave me alone with that. Eat some sea urchins, go on. I should have killed him. Who do you want to kill again, Papa Carlos? The Spanish kingpin, Franco, as usual. If I don't kill him, nobody will. But he's dead, Franco, Papa. I've told you 100 times already. That won't stop me. But he's been dead for 20 years now, we can't kill him anymore! We'd have democracy. But there's democracy in Spain now, Dad. Forget it! You can't leave me any. I don't blame you, you have your reasons. When you see all those children on TV with their skulls cracked open by a shell, with their stomachs swollen and their legs skinny, I say to myself that it's better to stop those from dying than to help me get one. We can't ask you to always do everything and us to do nothing. So, I have an idea. I think it will work. Soon, I'll be able to leave it to you forever. You know I hate churches? For what I have to tell you, it had to be a place like here, like a wedding. I want you to make me a child. - A child? But, you're crazy. - But, I want a child! You're like my sister. Patrick, he's a brother. That's exactly why, there's only you that I can ask and nobody will ever know. There are people for whom having a child, is an extra happiness. For me, it's the only happiness. For Patrick too. You can't refuse me that. I know that when you do it, that you have to, without wanting to, there's no fishing. Because when there is no desire, there is no pleasure. And if there is no pleasure, there is no fishing. You agree with me, Holy Virgin, no. Do you want me to turn off the lights? Come on. Do you refuse to serve him? If he pays, there's no problem. Even Lenin, I'd make him pay. What do you want us to pay with? Have you seen this? It's 175 francs. If I tighten it up again, it will be 600 francs. Do you think we can afford to let run up a bill of 600 francs? 600 is a round number at least. Forget it, Patrick, I won't drink anymore. That's it. That's it, drama. We've always been brothers, right? - Did I ever let you down? - No. We agreed on that. No? From time to time, you have to pay. This club has to run! When it closes, where will you go to drink your shots? - You drive a Mercedes. - What did Toto say? - How much does your car drink? - It's all right, Otto. Let him say it. Every month, he gets his pension as a hitman. - I'm not ashamed. - I know it. You're even proud of it. It was my job. No one asked you to enjoy it. A job you do without enjoyment, you do it badly. A guy who kills rats, when he's killed a hundred in a day, he's happy. He did a good job. I never killed anyone other than in service of France and I risked my neck every time. Have you seen my hair? Can you say that much? The guy who kills rats, he risks the plague, that's worse. He doesn't drive a Mercedes. Neither do I. I don't go to whores at night. Why would you go? Your whore, you have her at home. Will you shut up? It's okay! - Shut up or I'll break your arm. - Let go of him, shit. I'll get you, motherfucker. Arms like that, I've broken hundreds of them. Even kids. If I press it, it breaks! It's okay, Otto. Listen to me... Never forget: a legionnaire, it stays a legionnaire until it dies. Whores, it's a sedative, but it doesn't always work. Give me my change. I'm going to shoot that bastard. My car, it's all I've got. - It's old. - It's ok, José. But, if I hadn't been the best mechanic in Marseille, where would this car be ? It's fine. I've been dreaming about this car since I was a kid. If he comes back, I'll kill him. I didn't steal it, damn it. I've spent millions of hours on it, in the engine, under the carlingue. Damn, he ruined me, this motherfucker. Come on, have a drink. It's on me. Here. No, I'm not doing charity. - Drink up. Don't piss me off. - No! Can't we say anything more, then? - Is the slate yours? - I didn't invent it? - I'll pay you every cent. - I know it, I trust you. - Have a drink. It's mine. - I'll pay you every cent. - Where are you going? Why is he leaving? What's he doing? - Here, we can't say anything more, then. - It's okay, Jaco! Forget it, shit. I think I have a life elsewhere. - Excuse me? - I think I have a life elsewhere. That's mine! You don't think I'm going to get robbed on Saturday and Sunday, do you? Me, if my wife, she shows her ass to everyone... It's okay. Play, it's yours. - What are you drinking? - A coffee. Aren't you afraid that it will keep you awake? What could keep me awake? I wonder. My love. - Love keeps you awake. - Love. - Alcohol cuts off your legs. War makes you tired. Love... I thought you were a fag. Who told you that ? Aren't there guys you go to see, every night? Who? Who told you that? I'm joking. Can you see that I'm joking? Does it make you laugh to call me a faggot? I'm not calling you a faggot, I was joking. - I'm talking about love and you... - I'm telling you I'm joking. You're right, don't make fun of me. - You're not going to sulk? - Drink your coffee. - Don't you understand German? - No. - I love you. - I've been wanting to tell you for a while. - When you show your ass... - It's okay. It's not that! I imagined the three letters. Like a sign. C-U-L. The C was a series of strokes. The U. The U of union. And the L. The wing of an angel. You know, I've known a lot of girls. I always said to myself that the last one, was the one we loved the most. That's the only way I like them, the parrots, the blue ones. I'm quitting. That's it. You can't quit. You can see that I can't get a job. What do we do if you quit? It doesn't work anymore. No one comes anymore. And those who do come, they don't come for my ass. My ass hasn't attracted anyone for a long time now. It's the most beautiful ass in the world. It's just that it's not pretty to look at. Why do you think we've been living together for so long? It's because of your ass. It doesn't work anymore, José. We're not like you. What pisses us off is changing. You don't care. You're getting fat, you've got saggy skin, but as long as it holds up. It's nice of you to come to work with me. It's not just to go with you. - What are you going to ask me? - I'm not asking you that for me. - You're my sister. - I saw you undressed a hundred times when we were kids. - Your ass, I know it by heart. - My ass? - Eyes, only eyes. - But what else do they want than to know it with their eyes too? - And, nobody will ever put their hands on you. - It's not the house style. - At the Blue Parrot, we only touch with our eyes. Only with the eyes. You can ask Joséfa. And you think I would have let do it for 15 years, if it wasn't only for the eyes? You know, I love her, Joséfa. Marie-Sol, what I want to say to you, is that you can't go on like this all your life. Of course, I'm not offering you heaven, or even purgatory. But, finally, a strip-tease, a little strip-tease from time to time, is not hell. So, what do you say? Look, here's the thing, since you're my brother and I only have one, thank God or unfortunately, the slap, I'll keep it in my hand and I won't put it on your face. But, José doesn't come anymore ever talk to me like that. Joséfa, I know her. I love her and I value her, but don't come and tell me that she's happy. Well, now, the rest of us, since we're Marseillais and we live in the shadow of Notre Dame, I forgive you. When I get to work, I'll have forgotten everything. It's a beautiful day. I'm catching a cold. Wait, I'll go with you! Are you getting rusty? I'm getting rusty, I'm getting rusty... Wouldn't you like to work for me? - Hustling? - But, no. An honest job. - Honest? What does that mean? - Joséfa, she wants to stop. - She's old. - She's old! - I know she's old. - What do you think you're teaching me? - If I didn't know, - Do you think I'd ask you to replace her? - Do you think that will stop you from getting old? Joséfa, she has skin as soft as sand. - You're fucking me. - That, you see, can't be explained. - Yes, it can. - Do you want to work or what? - I have to think about it. - Why, is there someone? - What? I mean you have to to talk to someone? - You mean a pimp? - A pimp, a guy. I don't know. - No, there's no one. - All right, then. Farid? Farid? What the hell is he doing here? Do you know him? Yes. Farid! Listen, Farid! Farid! Wait. Farid! Stop, Farid! - Stop. - Let go of me! How could I know? I didn't know you knew her. If she's your wife, I swear, I'm not touching her anymore. For me, it was a hit like that. Men they all want her. Not you! I swear, I won't touch her anymore, if she's your wife. I've had beautiful women, I've had women less beautiful than her, too. I've even had ugly ones who smelled of dog piss, even when they didn't have dogs. But you, Farid, a friend like you, I've never had. You are like my son. You see, Farid, life is like that. Women, they don't have husbands. Men, they don't have wives. One day, they meet and they get married. It's simple. And you, you don't have a father. I don't have a child. That's it. - Would you like to be my father? - Yes. That would hurt me. Why do you say that? We get along well, don't we? A father dies. To be told what to do? My father taught me mechanics. He was the best mechanic in Marseille. Then he ended up at Ricard on the circuits. Dead. Crushed by a racing car that missed a turn. - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm kidding. No, he worked on the port, on boat engines. Then, one day, he slipped and the engine broke his spine. Right there, you see? He's not dead, but he's in a wheelchair. Do you love your father? You know, the day he dies, my father, because he's old. It will be the saddest day of my life. So, in your opinion, do I love him or do I love him? You love him. And, if I die tomorrow, will you be sad? Yes, very much so. - I need something. - Anything. Your workshop. - Why, do you want to learn about mechanics? - I'd like to be locked up in it... - Oh! With Venus. - Does it work? - Has he been fucking you for a long time? - Yes, it's starting to happen. - Why do you do this? - I only do this, Farid, with him or with the others. - Excuse me. - Do they give you money? - Yes. - Do you like them? - Of course not. - Come on, let's go. - No, wait. - We're going to sleep here. - Is the group coming back? - No. I'm beat. - Let yourself go. - Excuse me, I had imagined that... - I haven't reached that point yet. I'm sorry. For what? You're the boss, you've got the money, you wanted to fuck me, that's normal. I wouldn't want you to misunderstand. You didn't want to fuck me? That is to say you're beautiful, Marie-Sol. Desirable. And I have a nice ass. I would have liked not to have had to dislodge you. To have me under your hand? - You're getting back at me. - No, I've never been taught that. You know, I've made inquiries. It's not with the 15,000 francs increase that I gave you that you were able to find decent housing. - It's expensive, a rent, today. - Eh, yes. I could give you more. - No, I think you don't understand. - What, then? - I don't work for you anymore. - But, no! - Yet. Marie-Sol! When you call me that, I feel like a mop. What are you doing here? What about work? I left. No, that's not true. What did you do? What do you think I did? Cleaning. It's not a difficult job. You do it at home, It's the same at other people's houses, isn't it? Dusting, is it the same? Flooring, windows? What do you know? How do you want us to get by? Work. Then, it's okay. He wanted to screw me. I have to screw myself to keep a job. - We'll manage. We'll save money. - What do you want us to save on? We don't pay rent, no electricity. We eat pasta with margarine or potatoes with water. Sea urchins, too. We can't spend less without dying. - Life insurance. - No, never. - They'll pay back all the we've paid in for over ten years. - I don't want to. - But, since we'll never have children. - Isn't it for the children that we took it out? - I'll have children. - Oh, yeah? - How? - Like all women. - And even, how do you feed them? - To feed my child, I'm willing to be a whore. A pearl. A pearl. Yes. A pearl. That rolls and rolls on the tongue of an oyster for years and years. A pearl round as an ass. Round as the fruit of the sea, A shell. Round and warm as the sun. When the dress slides over the skin, that the fabric caresses the buttocks down. You can hear the sun slowly sinking into the wave of the sea. And when the dress falls to the ground, it's not the sound of the floor that you hear, it's the lapping of the fish bowing and wishing they were a cloud to be able to accompany it a little longer. A pearl. Let go of it! Jaco, haven't you seen it? Jaco? Excuse me. I'm ashamed, but I'm hungry. I don't have a job. I'm not really a bum, but I don't have a house anymore because I haven't paid the mortgage. So my wife left with my children. I'm not happy about it, I'd rather be in your shoes, if you could... - Let go of me. - Be nice. This is bullshit! I don't work because I don't feel like working. Shut up, slave! - Unbelievable. - Fuck you. Fucked. When they all arrived after their day's work, your brother with his fat, he shone in the room like a gypsy prince. It pleased me to show my ass and it pleased him that all those men were excited without being able to touch me. I was even more his. - 20 years of love, after all. - And yes, 20 years of love. You know, to keep a man, you have to let him have his own life, you have to let him have his friends, you have to let him do what he liked before he met him. Otherwise, it falls on your nose. Men are children. You must not lock them up, if you want to keep them. In the end, you can do what you want with them, but you mustn't let show. He thinks I don't know about Venus - About Venus? - Yes, like the statue, like the star. It's raining a lot, a little, but footing, Malek Boutih holds on to the podium. No less. There is an Arabic proverb that says there was his mouth to the hand and it is. A war of words not which means a good deed is only worth counting if it remains discreet. It is well what you photos, you say nothing, motus. We met like that by chance in the arms. The. The. Coup. Come on, walk! No, I assure you, I know how to do. Honestly, I do not know how to do eat a hot soup. I tell you it's an order. Don't worry, he'll eat, come on. And. Who had what when he arrived at our house? Here's almost four years, he arrived on December 3, 1957. I remember. You had to do it like this to make you eat badly. A little bit later, the other one is and she had patience, a lot of patience. Or how to let? Frank. Adoption. You don't have a little bit of a belly, do you, Marie-Sol, what a little bit of a belly? What do you say about my wife? Says she's put on a little bit of a belly. Do you think the ticket price? No. I must have been wrong. You'll tell me it's not because a sagging bidet in a woman and her buttocks and it pistant not fall off, it's just rounding off. He went anyway to women with a ball like that will end. Not on a soccer field, that's for sure. They wouldn't even be advised to. Football would risk losing it. But what's their ball? What are you trying to tell me here, but what do you want us to tell you? We're just telling you that your wife has a ball, but it's barely noticeable. These people are outraged. What would you want to be endowed with weird gets rounded. So what? So yes, and you? Nothing either. And you, Jaco, you don't say anything anymore? No, nothing either. Then, just now, you insinuated. I don't know what to do now. Nothing. Nothing either. Yet, you know very well that it can't have children. Yes, we know that. So what's the point of all these insinuations? Why a balloon? Why not? A helmet? Think about it, it's more like. A helmet and a balloon. And when we say helmet, it doesn't mean anything other than helmet. But no. You're dishonest, fake brothers because if you were honest, you wouldn't talk to each other the wrong way. You would say right away that I don't care what you tell me without this, my wife. How can it not be? How can it be, but it would be possible if this wasn't them who could do it. Yes, it would be possible, but that's true. You mean if it was me who couldn't have any? A supposition supposition, but supposition. So, let's assume just to assume that you already know that it's me who can't have any. What's the point? All these sentences that say the opposite of what they say. Let's assume that one day like this, as is her tactless habit by the way of the world to your sister, why she still doesn't have a pussy? It's quite normal yourself, you don't have any children, you're just itching to blow up a little larder, you little, devout. And suppose your sister answers it's the Patrick. We do all the tests, you can't have any. Suppose, yes. Now suppose so she's in the supposition. Suppose she's pregnant, the woman. What could mean? What could mean? So José only if we don't follow this? Yes, it should mean that you are a cuckold. That's it. I should be a cuckold. Or that I'm not sterile anymore. A remission happens. Let's suppose a doubling because in your case, someone lets it happen. In your case, it's much easier to be a cuckold. What is the fertile one doing? Yes, he's doing it like. It's who's the father, it's that he's. What's the point of all this? Why don't you torture me to make me say I'm pregnant and pregnant? And that. And pregnant. If I wasn't pregnant, you'd be there with you, a mother would make us. What do you think it is? And yes, I'm pregnant. I'm sure you didn't even see it. I'm sure it was Jacquot who noticed it first, but it's true, it's me and he's proud of it. You have to say it. What will it change? Your husband must know who is the father of his child, a man without a child, but it is mine, this child, not his. I have been praying to the Virgin for 10 years so that she grants me to be a mother. It is for nothing. God you want it, this child, thank you Asia, Patrick tells him that you want it, this little one, there has always been a desire for it. Well, maybe he'll be a little blue or a little green, or with the UN, not even a storm, I don't know. Me, I don't want anything. It's not. I want to know who the father is, but a gag of the father. He took a metaphor and then I talk to you about the kitty who wanted a plot. They are. We're making a big effort before closing tonight eh yes, closing and closing, but we can't open. It's too expensive. It's a pity. Hello, good evening François. What's going on, is Marisol has the state of health to come and to nothing. You notice that now. What do you say of this, Papa Carlos, this? She lives under my roof. Well, almost. She's carrying a child that isn't mine and can't tell me who the father is? What's stopping me from killing her and balls? Why does he have balls? That's what tortures. That's what I said, makes me laugh. How are we going to manage with one more child? What are we going to feed him with, who knows who's working? It's me, isn't it? These two, they find never a job. I'm here, he's retired. If he wanted to show his ass. This one, let's not talk about it. And you, you get pregnant, I'm going to work, I've found a job not too far away. Maybe we're not working, it's taking too many risks. I won't let you do it. Why are you suddenly worried, it's normal. I'm worried, it's normal. But yes. Yes, it's normal, but I understand everything. Do you understand? They combined all this. Don't you understand, José? He knocked up your sister. He suspected that one day or another, we'd find out, well done, so they combined everything by pretending to discover it at the same time as us. So, it goes with me. After you, it's better, but you're not going to believe it, you. If I had done that, tell me you that it's not me. I've never slept with Marisol. When we don't tell them who knows, it's a stranger, someone we don't know. And then there why not everyone abort if we don't want these kids, it's too late. I was on TV could have warned before Patrick, it's the least we can do, but what are you doing? It's not your child you see, it's not mine. Anyway, there's no question that Marisol works, but she won't need a job. Sale of the car. So what? The more you fuck! Don't move! I'm going to get some new ones, I see. Why are you doing this, I don't know, you're not going to mess with me about it, it was just a box, after all, a pile of junk, no more. I never even put of the most expensive oil. I always put with Rocabey tires on it to look good, there it was. But what? Who could use it? A car, that? The person. We're still behind on electricity less. How about we call it Jesus? Simons. The pusher, what's the fast track? It can then. The coach of. For one. I not. Roll where it is wet, it does not sink la. He was 21 months, 14 years old and was going to make. When he recognizes that between the walls, he did not create the term, he created nothing at all. He was crying. Was the captain. I was hidden. Of the left, it was I who buried him. You, the war, you have it every day, did not know it. You have to stick together, you have to stay the family nice, human, born. You have to have something to give him. You want to give work to a father, a mother, people that call a family, pulled them from the eyes color of a dad so to find a little twisted. But they walk straight and reason. Malicious, this young woman Narayen. And you, you are well done not to refuse what for the woman when she is abandoned? We didn't make a mistake. You can cheat me whoever you want? Patrick Joseph I don't know, but not me. And what does some appearances of people with a stranger? With Jose, this point? So what's left for you that we could adopt? You got 20/20 and if I believed in this thing I would give you my blessing. We don't know. A fatwa was still the right thing to do. You know what, Patrick? Fathers. And it's never really safe to be the fathers. Yeah, but I'm sure I'm not the father. But... what does it change? It changes everything. It changes everything. You are sure you are not the father. And while everyone else is wondering, and that's the great advantage to ask the question, it's not nice, it undermines you? There are even some who kill the woman by dint of to provide themselves with a title that only kills Entourloupe. Yannick is less. Look, for example José, who tells me that he is good. And Marisol looks at the Chinese, an Arab. Know, I'll find something I've never told anyone does not like too salty, sweet. I do not think it is better. If you want to tell me OK, if you prefer daddy carriage and stay as a job on a chair and be sure that your children are dedicated or found, can never be sure that anyone else will choose. That's a dumb question. Yes, I thought it would be possible, but finding my legs is another matter. I'm a goner. Then I'm going to bed again. He four years ago. years ago. Remove the lid. Who forgot the lid? Shit, have adopted, it sticks. It can be done. That's it, that's my neighbor. That's everything. Venus is sleeping. Or. You'll have kids who smoke younger. It's true, you're right, you still have to wait for the de Souza, otherwise the baby will have flowers instead of eyes, duck fingers and a mouth. A blow of. See this can in Ducey, it's not even what it is, boy or girl, I do not know. I didn't think to ask him. It's nice life. We could turn the cabaret into a house. It would be a nice house by the sea. The sea has always scared me. As long as I can walk, it's okay, otherwise. Maybe it's too stupid. No, not you who misses you well. You are well. Yes, we let the image of you of you with your legs spread under another man. You think he is naive and then? Above all, never tell him that he loses, not to him, not to me, not to anyone. For the rest, we know him, our country that will adore him. It has one of its most and. It is true, but you have to imagine him with a few extra pounds skinny in a suit, but with 5 or 10 kilos. A bomb. But Farid, he will agree. But Farid, that's the problem. He will not understand and can not understand the importance. vital importance of a young woman who undresses in front of a dozen guys. There's his age. He doesn't have to dream exactly. There, it won't be able to grasp of every woman who falls. That's the worry that goes to. Goodbye factory, goodbye boss! Goodbye unemployment, goodbye unemployment, goodbye scoring, goodbye credit. Goodbye expenses, goodbye Aboubakar, bye bye the heart dishes. Arrival of old age. If you have want to go see further in the air, you have grown, let me laugh. On the eve of. Before die and be all worthy to read, or to Thaddeus or to my niece. I am cold. I had to. We're going to bed. Are you coming to bed? That's good. My darling, Marie-Sol, whom I'll always love, I'm leaving with the image of you, the first time I saw you. It was the feast at Saint-Gabriel. You were shooting a rifle. You looked tangled. You even got your cheek stuck with the butt. You couldn't close your eye to aim. You made me laugh. Now you're going to have a child. I thought we would have lots of children. Children of our own. At that time, we were working non-stop. There was no reason for it to stop. I thought we would have a little house and that on Sundays, in the garden, we would have drinks with our friends and watch the children play with each other, ours and those of our friends. I don't have a car to sell to help you and the child, your family, your friends I know, you're going to think that I did this because I'm a cuckold. You're wrong. I called the insurance company, they told me that there was 228,000 francs in case of death. If you spend 7,000 francs a month, you'll be able to hold on for a little over two years and eight months. If you invest the remaining money at 6%, it will give you time to see it through. Don't tell anyone about this letter, not even friends. Everyone will think it was an accident. I'm very glad to be dead. See you soon. I love you very much, Patrick. In my opinion, is neither the beginning nor the end. It's in between. It's in the middle. How are you born, how do you die? Life is in between. Birth, death, it's not that important. He had his life. And that's what counts. It's all together that we make a beautiful future for our children. Trust me.
