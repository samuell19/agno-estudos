Get over here! Look, what do you see? Papa, the scorpion, it needs help. Life is cruel, Satoshi. It doesn't care where you are from, what God you pray to. It is. So you must face it head on. See the scorpion? No matter how many enemies, it continues on. It is strong, yes. It is fast. But do you know why the scorpion is feared? Its will. Willpower is what makes your destiny your own. Learn to be strong, here and here. Promise me you'll remember that? I will, Papa. Now, let's get home. Your mother is making dinner, and she won't be happy if we're late. Hold on. Faster, Papa, faster! More! Your papa needs a break. Where is everyone, Papa? Hold tight, Satoshi. Aah! Harumi. Harumi! Harumi! Mama! Enough! Come further, and he dies. What do you want? On your knees. Ahh! If you touch a hair on his head... Papa! Papa. Satoshi! Satoshi! Satoshi. Satoshi! Satoshi! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! You'll die for this. You first. Lord Raiden! I'm sorry. I... I didn't know. No, you did well, Lui Kang. Just as you were taught. And now, I pray it is enough. Enough? Then it is time. Yes. Do not worry. We have prepared for this moment for a long time. I chose you for a reason, Lui Kang. Now, the others will be gathering. We must hurry. Lord Raiden, what others? No, no, listen. We can make this work, I promise. What do I have to do, huh? How about cleaning this hell-hole you call a home? How about doing something besides crying about your career? You only care about yourself! It's all about Johnny Cage. Call me when you grow up. So, I can still call her then. That's a W. Hey! You're in the cage with Johnny. Oh, well. If it isn't my long-lost agent. It's about time you called. Of course, I'm interested in something different. What have I been telling you? Yeah. China? Uh-huh. All right, well, what about an advance? Uh, things have gotten a little... Little tight around here. Hello? Hello. Well, I'm off to China! Kick him in the face! You gonna keep crying like a bitch or fight like a man? Yeah, yeah, that's right. This is no place for a little girl. This is no place for a little girl... This is no place for little girls. Hmm. Do you think this is funny? Congratulations, cadet. You've just become my new pet project. You think you're pretty special, don't you, princess? Sir! My name is Sonya Blade, and I'm going to be the best soldier you've ever met! Sir! We'll see about that. You wanted to see me, sir? Yes, I did. I'm putting together a task force. High-level spec ops stuff. Are you in? I'm gonna kill you! You're gonna try. That's my car! Not yet, whore. My teeth. My teeth! Honestly, it's an improvement. Oh, shit! Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! Sonya! He'll be there? If he's not, there's nowhere on Earth you'll be able to hide from me. Understand? Satoshi. Harumi. What is this? Where am I? Don't start without me. Ah! Fresh meat. What in the hell... Close. Netherrealm. It's no use. You are a prisoner here. For how long? Forever. Listen. Ah! Do you hear it? The symphony of pain. Your voice will soon join the others, rising up to please the great Shinnok. Shinnok? The master of Netherrealm. There. The only place of reprieve in this realm. Look on it and weep. Sharp enough. Calm yourself. Save your energy for what is about to come. Now you see, you feel pain, though you can no longer perish. We can do this for all eternity. Huh? What is it you say? Is that a prayer? No. No God can help you here. I need no God! I will take pleasure in ripping your flesh from your bones! Human, you have made a big mistake. There are thousands of us, and only one of you. Minus one. Shinnok! No, Shinnok is... indisposed. Then go fetch him for me. If only I could. I am Quan Chi, in charge of this realm until the master's return. And who do I have to thank for ruining my rug? Hanzo Hasashi. Your reputation precedes you, Hanzo Hasashi. Welcome. Though, I'm not entirely sure how you made it here. What is it you want, Hanzo? To return home. To seek my revenge. Home? You can't return home. You will do as I say, or I will flay you alive. Did you think me defenseless, dog? In my realm no less. You may be a vengeful spirit, but even they have their limits. Besides, that's not what you really want, is it? Once a generation, there is a tournament. During that time, the veil is lifted, so that warriors may gather to fight on behalf of their realm. I can send you there. Why would I fight for you? Because he will be in attendance. What do you want? Good, skilled and smart. Long ago, my master, Shinnok, was unjustly imprisoned. This is the key to his release. It's being kept at the temple of Shang Tsung, the putrid mortal that has the favor of the emperor of Outworld. The tournament will take place on his island. Get me that key. Once my master is released, he can return your family. Even you, back to the mortal realm. Do we understand each other, Hanzo? Hanzo is dead. Call me Scorpion. Hold the boat! I'm coming! Coming through. I'm co... Whoa, whoa... Hmm. Mmm? Hope no fans saw that. I'm wearing slip-ons. Lui Kang, of the White Lotus Society. Johnny Cage, of the superstar variety, but you probably knew that. And you are? Not interested. Oh, you will be. They always are. So, you guys in this thing, too? Yes, I have trained many years for this moment. Oh, yeah? Listen, I love acting classes and all, but they're really kind of a time suck. You know what I mean? No? Anyway, my agent said this would really put me back on the map. Kind of a back-end-deal-type-of-thing. Should be fun. We are approaching the veil. Who is that? Let me guess. He's kind of like our, uh, Merlin. That is Lord Raiden. Protector of Earthrealm. Boom! Nailed it. Wait, Earthrealm? Did you guys get a script already or something? Look, I'd love a copy. I have no idea what you're talking about, but I am pretty good at improv. So, uh... Lord Raiden, right? Good to meet you. So, tell me more about this veil. The space between realms, to prevent Outworld from merging with Earthrealm. Prevented by what? Always the soldier, evaluating risks. What guards the veil is of less consequence than why it does so. If Shao Kahn wins this tournament, Earth, as you know it, will cease to exist. Not to fear, Lord Raiden. I, Johnny Cage, will make sure that Earthrealm, so dumb, will be safe from harm. You have my word on it. Lord Raiden, these are the champions you gathered? You doubt my choices? No, I just meant... You see only what is in front of you, Lui Kang, but your eyes deceive you. It is what is inside that matters. Sonya Blade, a most formidable warrior. She has had to prove herself against many who thought she was nothing more than a weak girl. Believe me, she is anything but. And him? He only seems to be concerned about himself and material wealth. That will keep him alive, until he finds something more to care about. Something greater than himself to live for. Are you kidding me? I paid extra for international, and I can't even get a signal. Uh, Raiden, are getting one? What in the... Stay in the vessel. It is under Lord Raiden's protection. Out there, there's nothing good. Oh, right. Paparazzi. We've arrived. Look. That must be the bad guy. One at a time, everybody. One at a time. Brought enough for everyone. Okay. Where'd you guys put my trailer? I'd like to freshen up before we start shooting. Ugh. He has no idea what he is doing. Should we tell him? His journey is one of discovery. Besides, I find it amusing. Remember our deal, Scorpion. Whoa. Yeah! Yeah! Be on guard. Shang Tsung is not to be trusted. Oh, look! Craft services. Great! Hey, do you know if any of this stuff is organic? Just asking. Geez! Now is your chance. In the beginning, were the elder Gods. In their wisdom, they created a tournament to safeguard each realm from the threat of invasion. Once a generation, the finest warriors must do battle to decide the fate of their realm. The winner will be granted long life and great power. If one realm wins the tournament ten times, they will have the right to merge with the other, and rule as they see fit. I, Shang Tsung, emissary of the great Shao Kahn, emperor of Outworld, winner of the last nine tournaments against Earthrealm, welcome you to Mortal Kombat. Mortal Kombat! Now, as host of this tournament, I think it only fitting that I provide you with some... entertainment. Kano. Jax! Jax! Listen, you son of a bitch, you better open this, whatever it is, or I'm gonna use your ass as my own personal punching bag. Oh, that is so hot. - Princess. - Asshole. I told you to wait for me. I got excited. You got caught by that idiot Kano. Yeah, that too. Unless you want me to rip that pencil-thin mustache off your face, I think it's best you let me go, old man. Absolutely. You are free to leave at any time. The doorway is right there. Of course, you have to get past my champion. Goro! Goro! Goro! Goro! Goro! Goro! What the hell? Jax! No! Relax, kid. I've got this. All right, ugly. You wanna dance? Let's dance. I wouldn't. Let me guess. Quan Chi promised you life if you would do his bidding. Ah... No. Not you. Someone else. Someone you lost. Someone you care about. Do you think Quan Chi is a man to be trusted? What choice do I have? We all have choices. Live in the past, or live for the future. The key won't solve your problems. It will, however, create new ones. And my revenge? Revenge is too heavy a burden to carry. You are a free man. It's time you start acting like it. Really, Goro, you shouldn't play with your food. Stop it! You'll kill him. That's the idea. Finish him. No! Yeah! Pfft! Fake. These special effects suck. Enough! You forget yourself, Lord Raiden. You are not to interfere in the tournament. I was unaware the tournament had begun. We are here for Mortal Kombat, not your barbarism. As you wish. Kano! Jax! Hold on! I'm coming for you! You hear me? No matter what! I'm coming for you! Wow! She's great. I mean, that is some serious method acting there. Am I right? I can see we're all anxious to get started. Good. I have determined your opponents and where on the island you will fight. Let Mortal Kombat begin! Uh... Okay. That was weird. Did someone slip me something? Or... Holy shit! Hello? Sonya? Lord Reagan? Radar? Whatever your name is. This thing better not go straight to video. Gunpowder? Must be some sort of old fortress. Bingo. Hard as a fossil. No craft services, no trailers. My agent is gonna hear about this when I get home. Sheesh. Hello? I should at least get a per diem. Oh, hey, how's it goin'? That... That is one hell of a costume. Uh... Are we live? Like, you wanna do this now? Whoa, buddy, pro-tip. Uh, next time, pop a few mints. Whoa! Whoa! Go easy! We haven't even rehearsed. Hey, asshole! That was custom! Dick. And barrel. Eat me, buttercup. Toasty. Come on! Face me like a man! All right, asshole. Let's see what you've got. Not so fun now, is it, you cold-blooded bastard? Heads up! Fuck with the Blade, you're gonna get cut. You move like the Shirai Ryu. But they're dead. Who are you? What do you want? Revenge! Tell me, Lin Kuei scum, where is Sub-Zero? Die, knowing I will kill every last member of the Lin Kuei on this island. Every last one. You are Raiden's chosen one. No wonder your realm has lost so many tournaments. I do not wish to hurt you. Spare me your pity. Do not get up. I take no pleasure in hurting such a worthy foe. But, know this. I will do whatever it takes to defend Earthrealm, and win this tournament. Then you are a fool. Shao Kahn cannot be defeated. He will take your world, and you will bow your knee like countless others before you. I promise you, I will never bow before that madman. I yield. What makes you so sure you will win? Because I have something no one in Outworld has. - What? - Hope. Impressive, Raiden. Your warriors have made it further than I would have thought. They are strong in spirit, Shang Tsung. You will not win today. I have heard such promises before. Thankfully, after Goro kills whomever makes it to the final round, I will not have to hear them again. And, Quan Chi, your warrior from Netherrealm, he is proving to be quite formidable. For the glory of Outworld, I serve at the pleasure of Shao Kahn. Indeed. You won't succeed. No matter how many foes you put between the Earthrealm fighters and your champion, they will make it to the end. Oh? I'm glad you feel that way. Surely you know of the Black Dragon. It seems that several have made it onto the island with orders to kill your Earthrealm friends. How dare you? Are you accusing me of something, Lord Raiden? You brought them here to interfere with the tournament! And break the rules? Even I am not so bold as to anger the elder Gods in such a way. You will not succeed, Shang Tsung. We'll know soon enough, won't we? What I wouldn't give for a frozen margarita. Hey! Really? I know, look at this shirt. It's ridiculous. I'm glad to see you, though. Okay, you won't believe this, but this isn't some sort of movie. This is the real deal. Maybe a snuff film or something. I don't know. But I had to fight some, uh... I don't even know what it was. I barely got out alive. I can believe that. Listen, I'll get you out of here, but we'll need to stick together. First rule of combat is to secure our position. Let's find somewhere to hole up, and then we can start recon. Find out where we are, what we are up against. A sound strategy. You both made it. Good. I fear it's only going to get harder from here. Whoa. Wait, what's gonna get harder? I just fought a walking pair of teeth on the side of a mountain. I'm not Tom Cruise, you know. I act. I leave that stunt shit for the stunt people. Listen, sweetheart, we should get out of here... Oh, my... dick. Fuckballs, no one touches me without permission, you got it? Got it. You said you knew where we were? I do. But it will be dark soon. We need to make camp. Rest. Agreed. No, no. Don't wait for me. I'm fine. Let me just pee out some blood first. What the fuck? I think I'm gonna be sick. Stay behind me. I'll take care of this. What is this, 1950? Step back, Bruce Lee. Bring it, bitch. Whoa, whoa, whoa, everyone just chillax, okay? No one needs to fight anyone. Especially some guy that just went psycho on a bunch of, uh... Black Dragon. Mercenaries. Assassins. Bad guys. Yeah, those guys. We have to continue. Once Mortal Kombat has been declared, it must be finished. Did you declare Mortal Kombat? - Did you? - Nope. What about you, Mister... Scorpion. Oh, it's catchy. I like that. Did you declare Mortal Kombat? Good. Good. Great! Then no one needs to die. Sheesh. Now, who's hungry? I know you didn't believe it before, but it's all true. The elder Gods, the tournament, everything. Emperor Shao Kahn has won nine previous Mortal Kombat tournaments. If he wins a tenth... Then what? Then you all die. Great. Just great. Yeah. Okay, monsters, magic, this can't be real. Somebody must have slipped something into my drink. - I'm hallucinating. - Get a grip, Johnny. Whatever this is, it's real. There's no use sitting around and whining about it. If what Lui Kang says is true, then the whole world is in trouble, and we have to stop it. If I can get to a radio, a communications array, I can call in reinforcements. Turn this island into the next cautionary tale. If only it were that easy. - Lord Raiden. - You. What do you mean, "If only it were that easy"? Do you know what a Hellfire missile can do? I'm sure it's very powerful on Earth. But we are not on Earth. This island lives in a place between realms. A place set aside specifically for the tournament. Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great. So, if what Lui Kang says is true, then you're really some sort of God, right? I have been given many names. Well, shoot, Buddha! Snap your fingers. Get us home! I'm done with psycho monsters and bad food. And by the way, I'll never complain about doing a sequel again in my life. He cannot. Lord Raiden is forbidden from interfering in the tournament. It is a bargain he made to save Earthrealm from being taken over eons ago. Well, that's insane. The fate of the world is being decided by some sort of karate tournament? Are you kidding me? You are the only hope left for Earthrealm. Head toward the temple where your final battles await... and your destinies will be made clear. But be on guard. There are others on this island who will try to keep you from the final round. Great. So, uh, we are screwed. If Lord Raiden believes we can make it, we can. No, you can't. Well, you seem very fun, Mr. Scorpion. Shang Tsung has the numbers. He has that... monster. Go. Hide in the jungle until it is over. And let Earth be destroyed? Sorry, pal. I took an oath to defend it, no matter the odds. He would not understand, Sonya. Someone such as him, has never known anything worth dying for. You cannot survive. My will is strong. My destiny is my own. You are as naive, as you are doomed. I have waited here too long. Know that the next time we meet, it will not end well. Well, that was cheery. Shut up, botox. I'm just sayin', he really killed the vibe around here. I was just... Shutting up. Yep. Scorpion was right about one thing, we've rested long enough. We must continue on. I've found them. So, we're here, now what? Oh, great. This is fair. The rules state that it must be single combat. These lads aren't here for the tournament. They've been paid to kill you. Hello, love. Nice to see you again. Mwah. Why don't you come over here and I'll give you a hug? Well, you'd do a better job than Jax. I guess Raiden was wrong. - Oh, you think? - No, stay together. We'll survive. We have to. Yeah, we better. I need to make it home, so I can kill my agent. - Be ready. - For what? Aah! You see? I knew he liked us. Stay down! I know how to fight... Sure you do. Just stay down. Oh, man, is she hot! Down! Huh? What gives? You dishonor this tournament. You will die for what you did! That's for my clan! This is for my wife! And this is for my son. Screw it. He's not paying me enough for this. Kano! Go, save your partner. Sonya. Partner? Raiden said your destiny would be clear. So, there she is. You know what, I guess I don't mind having my balls crushed. By her, I mean. Doesn't make it any better. I'm disappointed. I brought you here for one purpose. And you have failed me. You're as weak as your wife was. As your child. Yes, you fool. It wasn't Sub-Zero at all. I killed them. It was easy. I used sorcery to hide my identity. To make the Lin Kuei do as I wanted. You are strong, Scorpion. But not immortal. I think I'll leave you here. Just like I left your son. To be eaten by the birds. Papa, the scorpion, it needs help. Do you know why the scorpion is feared? Its will. [men screaming Come on, Sonya, darling. Just a bit further. - Jax. - Sonya? I'm so glad you made it. It's gonna be a joy to watch you end up like your partner. You think I'm afraid of you? Bring it on. Fuck. Shang Tsung. Ah, I'm impressed, Raiden. You were right. He has great spirit. And even greater skill. Please, we both know yours is a lost cause. Goro! I'll make you a deal, Lui Kang. Yield, and Shao Kahn will grant you mercy. You can come to Outworld. Live as a king. We shall show you every pleasure. Is that how Shao Kahn got you to betray your world? I am not as weak as you, Shang Tsung. Then you shall die. Fight! Whoo! Oh. Poor Raiden. It must be awful to watch your beloved chosen one die, and be unable to do anything about it. The fight is not over yet. It may as well be. Quan Chi, goblets. Let us toast to our Emperor's impending victory. Splendid idea. Now, Lui Kang, you can do better than that. For Outworld. For Shao Kahn. Now, finish her! Here's Johnny. Argh! Johnny? Don't worry, babe. I got this. All right, boys. Picture's up, roll sound. And action! Impossible. Holy shit. Johnny Cage can fight. Save some for me. I told you, you'd come around. Ugh... Ha! Eat it. Well done. Truly, I underestimated you. But... I am bored now. Goro, play time is over. Aah! Kano! Stay back! I'll slit his throat. Aah! Wait a minute. Now we can go. Aah! Yes. Yes. You see, Quan Chi, the key to winning is always being a few steps ahead of your enemies. Did you think I didn't know you'd betray your Emperor, Quan Chi? You're mistaken. I would never... All for what? This? He's been imprisoned for a reason, Quan Chi. Your sad devotion to the mad God Shinnok, makes you as pathetic as he is. Soon, Earthrealm will be Shao Kahn's, and his destiny will be complete. It's too bad you won't live long enough to see it. Finish him. Does it hurt? Soon, your weak species will be no more. Who dares? Scorpion. Impossible. It would seem I underestimated your champion, Quan Chi. You are Scorpion of Netherrealm, yes? You have killed Goro. Thus you must take your rightful place as the champion of Outworld. I want nothing to do with your game. I've come for him. Interesting. Defeat Lui Kang, and you can have Quan Chi to do with as you wish. Defeat Lui Kang, and my emperor will give you all that you dream of. Vengeance is not the way, Scorpion. Of course it is, and it's yours. All you have to do is kill him. Good. Good. What choice did he really have, Lord Raiden? There's always another choice. Now. Fight. What are you doing? Living for the future. Give me the key. You fool. Shao Kahn will hear about this - and kill you. - I'm already dead. Lui Kang. - I yield. - No. Then the tournament is finished. Outworld has lost. Earthrealm is safe. I will kill you all. The tournament is over, Shang Tsung. I am no longer bound by rules of non-interference. Return to your Emperor. Tell him of your failure. You have made a mistake, Lord Raiden. Emperor Shao Kahn will have his revenge. I'm counting on it. No. Without Shang Tsung's power, the island will collapse. We must go. What about Scorpion? His path lies elsewhere. - But... - Now. I knew you would survive. I chose you for a reason. Give me the key and we can leave this place before it is destroyed. Come take it. Like you did my family. Very well. But please, put up more of a fight than your wife did. I'm going to finish the job my demons couldn't. Die, you wretched vermin. It's time to die. Indeed. Lui, Lord Randy. Need a lift? Get over here. My God will avenge me. Damn your God. So, is that it? - Did we win? - For now. All right! Yeah! Uh... May I? All right, yeah. Mmm. Hmm, cinnamon. Mmm, yeah, pat me there. Doesn't mean I'm gonna break the hug. - That's enough. - Okay. Think she'll ever like me? She didn't hit you in the nuts, did she? Yes, she did, Jax. Yes, she did. I have failed you. I could not defeat Goro. If it wasn't for Scorpion... Failed? No. Your destiny was never to defeat Goro, Lui Kang. It was to defeat Shao Kahn. You have failed me. I'm sorry, Master. It was that old fool, Raiden. - He... - Silence! Gather our forces. It's time to end this game... once and for all.
