I can tell. - Don't play with these, ok? - Ok. These are for grandpa. Ok! Dad, wake up. Wake up. Take these. Did you do your stretches today, dad? - Hey, Cody. - Hey, Mom. How you doing, kiddo? Did you bring cigarettes? Yeah. Hey, Zach. What's up, sis? Change of plans. Can you take Cody? I've got a shift and then I was gonna go see Gabe before he leaves town. Yeah, but I gotta take dad home and Allen called and I'm supposed to meet up with him later. I could leave him with dad... Cody. Let's go for a ride. Thank you. -Can I drive? - Come on dad, I'll give you a ride back to Carol's. Sure, go get her started. Cody! Table 5! I told you. I can't close up today. Derell's not here yet. You're stuck, kid. This is a diner, Picasso. Not the Louvre. Come on! People are waiting. Finally, man! I gotta go. Sorry man. Cody, let's jet. (music) Yo, Gabe! Hey hey, the Gabester! -Yo! You're learning to skate I see. Fuck you. What up. -What up. I've got Cody in the car so let's go. Baby on board, huh? - I'm taking you to the lot, right? - Yeah, cool. Hey you should come up to S.B. You know, wouldn't hurt to get some pussy you didn't have in high school. You and Tori broke it off, right? Sorta... -You know how it is. -"Sort of"... Dude... he's five. He's sleeping. No I'm not! You are a sly one. Yeah he likes to pretend he's sleeping. Go figure. That smells like Alan's cigarette. Who's Alan? Jeanne's boyfriend. Of the week... Dude, why don't you try and go to Santa Barbara Community College? You can crash at our house until you get your own place, you know? At least get the fuck out of San Pedro. I don't think the whole student thing is gonna happen right now. Why? Because you didn't get into that Art Institute place? - Go somewhere else - "Art Institute place"... Whatever, it's alright. That scholarship was my ticket... Well you are the king of scholarships. Got me into your ritchie rich private school. On the short bus every day. -Rich fuck. Fuck you, ghetto trash. You ever declare a major? Larry said I should go for Communications. "Communications." What does that mean? It means I'm set, dude. Larry's gonna set me up with something at his firm, you know, so I can go back and get some more partying out of my system. Move back here, buy a couple suits. Start making some real cash. You could have the same life... if you wanted. Alright bro. Alright man. Come up and hang out soon ok? Alright. No, I mean it this time, dude. You've been up once. That shit ain't right. Look, I'll get you a plane ticket. Or just get in the car and drive. - Cool? - Ok. Code-man. Keep it real, playboy. - Promise? - Yeah. Ok, ok, go... Gotta pee, gotta pee, gotta pee... - Hey. - Hey. I'm gonna go out for a session. No, I thought you were staying. I went shopping. And I invited Ellen over. What? You're an eligible bachelor, right? That's what I heard. Not that you would ever tell me. (Walkie-talkie static) -Shh. You know, if you keep breaking up with Tori like that, one of these times she's not coming back. Jeanne, Jeanne, come in Jeanne. Cody to Jeanne. Cody, I don't wanna play right now. Just watch the TV, okay? Hey. Listen, I'm heading out, alright?

Looks like you're the babysitter tonight little brother. Guess so. Hello? Hey, monkey. Hey, what are you doing? Guess... Babysitting? Bingo! -Hey listen, can I call you back? Where are you? Are you there? Zach? I can't hear anything. - Uh, yeah. - Hey, I'm losing you. - Yeah, I'm here. - Can you hear me? Hello? Tori, I was thinking about you and... - I'll meet you at Billy's. Hello? (glass falls) Jesus Christ! You fucking idiot... Oh my God... get the opener. Jeanne, what the fuck?! Shit, dad's mad. I just put him to bed. Oh come on, he can sleep through everything. Just keep it down, alright? Did you get cigarettes? Yeah, come here. (music) I thought your ghetto ass would be done breaking and entering by now. Change of code, bitch! What are you gonna tag the garage next? That may not go over... you know. With the Pacific Bluff homeowners agreement, wouldn't wanna set your dad in trouble with the board. Step-dad. I left my longboard here. That's cool. How you doing, man? Good, good, you know. So I haven't seen you since like your graduation. What have you been up to? Nothing. Working, you know. How about you? I'm just down for a few weeks. House is empty, I could enjoy it. Clear my head a little bit. I thought you hated it down here? I miss the ocean. Dude, you live in L.A. I don't paddle out there. You wanna go? Surfing? Uh... yeah. I suppose there's still a few things I could teach you. You will soon learn, butterfly. Perhaps master underestimate student. Bring it on, city boy! (music) Well, we picked a good time to come out. Yeah, the tide's coming in. Yeah. Hey, where are you living now? With Jeannie in San Pedro. It's just for now, you know. I'm trying to save up to get my own place. But you know, it's close to my dad and work and stuff. Well you guys are welcome to come out here anytime you want. Just like old times, huh? Minus Gabe. Right. Hey... you see him much? A bit. He came down last year with some of his friends. Those guys like to party. You can say that again. How is Jeanne doing? You know, the same I guess? I try to help out as much as I can. I cannot see her as a mom. Cody must be getting big? Yeah, he's five already. -Wow. It's crazy, you know. Time just flies. Yep. Trust me, it only gets faster. Yeah, I bet. Hey, monkey! What's up? What are you doing down here? Only place for dogs and a fire on the beach. Yeah. Come down, grab a beer. Cool, I'll be down in a sec. Alright. Hey, you wanna go grab a beer or do you wanna just take off? Yeah, I'll grab a beer. Sounds good. Cool. So who'd you come down with? Billy. Who is that? Shaun! Gabe's brother? Yeah. He doesn't come back much. He's been pretty MIA. It's nice to see you. Yeah, it's good to see you too. Going long! Are you gonna play or are you just gonna talk shit about me? Nice throw. I'm Tori. I remember you. You were 13 and you had crimped hair, but I remember you. I bought you guys wine coolers. I think you puked on my parents' deck. Wow. You're still putting up with this guy's shit? Well, we're both still here. Right on. (music) That's why you never tell a woman how to cook a chicken. I can't believe you got shot by a chick. Shaun, right? Aren't you Gabe's bro? Yeah. Heard you went all Hollywood, writing movies or something. Yeah, or something. What's the deal? You're still with Tori then? Are you a fag? I mean she's hot. So it's cool if I move in on that then? The swell's coming in. Yeah it looks that way. Trip seeing Tori. Yeah, I bet. You guys have been together for years. Yeah we're just taking a little break right now. I mean, she's my best friend. Other than Gabe. It's all good. You dating anyone? No, I just broke up. Yeah? Is that why you're really down here? No, no, no... Yeah, actally it is. I moved out of our place and, uh, my new lease doesn't start until the end of the month. That's cool. (phone buzzes) I'm sorry. -Mhm. Hello? I thought we weren't gonna leave him over there. No, don't drive, Jeannie. I'll go get him. Yeah. I gotta go. Alright. Tori said she needs a ride so... That's cool, I'll catch a ride from someone. -It's cool. Great riding today. - Alright, man. Yeah, it was good seeing you man. - Yeah it was fun. - Ok cool. (horror movie music) I'm gonna leave. Wait, come here... I'm tired. Goodnight. Did I write this shit? Oh my God. (ska music) (walkie-talkie static) Hello! Hello! Is anyone out there? Hello. Is anyone out there? Hellooo... Shaun? Who the fuck is this? Master does not know his own student. Student is ashamed. Master gets old. Where'd you find these? Dude, they were just laying around the house. Man, Gabe and I used to stay up for hours on these. I can't believe that these go all the way to your house. All the way to the ghetto. They were the latest technology back then. I think your dad bought them for Gabe in an airport when he missed a Christmas one year. Step-dad. Yeah, I remember that year. I think he got me a talking dart board. (laughter) That sucks! Oh hey, I saw some of your tags today. They're sweet. -Yeah? Yeah, you've got that crane thing going on; it looks cool. -Glad to see someone's doing their artwork. Yeah, sometimes. (ska music continues) It was, uh.... It was nice riding out there today. Yeah. (beep) (squeak) What's up? Your battery's probably gonna run out. Probably hasn't been replaced in 10 years. (ska music continues) What are you listening to? Um, nothing... (beep) (squeak) He's a fighter. He's totally a fighter. He's gonna kick his ass. One... But he wants to look good... kicking his ass. He's wearing a sweet suit, and he's gonna kick his ass. (doorbell) Ha! Dude, it's breaking overhead. Let's roll to the 'bu. I'm working. Really? That's too bad. Alright, see you later then. Alright! Hold on, I'll come. You might wanna change first. Come on dude, let's go! (music) Oh, dude, it's a fucking circus out there. I'll protect you from the big brewery. Go... I've got a better spot. -Pussy! Better spot... Go. - It's nice. - Yeah. - The break looks good, man. -Just gotta figure out where the road is. -Uhhhh... Oh right there! Right there, right there! Careful. - Should've told me sooner. - Sorry, sorry. Go. This is rad! Sorry I never told you and Gabe about this place, man. I just didn't want it to turn into the remnants of your keggers every Sunday morning. This is my place I used to come to get away and think. - And surf? - And surf. -Let's go. -Let's go. So you still thinking about applying to art school? I do street art now. It's cool though, you know. What are you working on? A book. Oh. What, it's been like, uh, 3 years since the last one, right? - Is it really long or something? - Fuck off. You sure didn't leave much out of the last one. You read it? Who knew there'd be so much drama inside the gates of Pacific Bluffs. I never knew. You never really know what's happening inside. Yeah, that's what I liked about it. I did embellish a little bit; it is fiction. You changed a couple of names? When did you read it? When it came out. Funny, Gabe never mentioned anything. I never told him. Why would he tell you? I just never knew that you knew about me. What's your new one about? Uh, still trying to figure that out. Don't really have a subject yet. But, I'll get it back. I hope so. You're good. - You really liked it? - Yeah. You hungry? Yeah, you wanna go to the shack or something? Yeah, definitely. So, how long you staying around? I'm gonna be here for a while. I was supposed to go to Barcelona to meet a friend next month, but I'm kinda broke. You should ask Larry for the cash. Ooh no, that's not my style. Have you ever been to Europe. I've been to Florida once. And that time your parents took me to Mexico. - That's about it. - That's right, that's right. - I don't travel much. - You should go, man. I'd like to someday. I mean, just for the art. -Yeah. (phone buzzes) Hmm. Go ahead, take it. Nah, it's cool. What? You guys like, in limbo or something? Yeah, yeah... - I'm not good at that. - Takes a little practice. And he drives right through the stop sign. And out into some field. He totally passed out. He must've been wasted, man. He was totally hammered. He's a fucking idiot. But he's my brother. And I love him. And my best friend. -Cheers! -Cheers! I'm gonna get another... you? -Mhmm, Ok. -Alright. Here you go... Thanks, brother. - Wow. - Woah... what are you doing? Easy dude, it's ok. I wanna look at it. No one ever looks at that. Wow, is that Cody? Yeah. A sad Cody. You could tell? Yeah. And how you darkened it around his head. This is incredible. And there's no toys in his room. Wow. It's awesome. Yeah, he'd just gotten scolded. He was trying to understand why... So he came into my room. He hasn't left yet. It's the only place he could sleep. Ok, enough. Ow, ho ho, ow. Ow! Adam's apple. - I'm trashed. - The cops are definitely coming. Shit! (music) What? You'll make it. Cody, let's go. Where were you? - Surfing. - All night? Yeah, what the fuck? I'm just asking. - Want a ride or not? - Go. Cody, let's go! I think I should reapply to CalArts... What's CalArts? It's a school, buddy. - I get to go to school next year. - Yep. They already turned you down. What made you think of that? It's just a thought. Well don't get your hopes up. I mean we're having a hard time, Zach. I don't need you getting all down. Yeah... Alan paints houses. Maybe I can see if he can hook you up with a job. Ooh. You're heavy. Come on. - I'll be right in. - Alright, hurry up. Hey, monkey. Hey. I'm late. Hey. Oh hey. I hear you've been hanging out with Shaun. Surfing. Well you know about him, right? What about him? He's gay. He's an old friend, Jeanne. We've been surfing together since I was 8. Yeah, well is that all? Yeah, what are you saying? - Nothing. - Good. Zach, I just don't think that he's the best guy to be hanging out with all day half-naked... if you know what I mean. And I don't want Cody around that. What? Why? I'm late. Get out. Fine. Zach, you're not a fag, right? Jeanne... Wait, you never tell me anything. How am I supposed to know? What do you think? I think I don't wanna deal with that. Hi dude. - I tried calling you. - Yeah. - Listen, I just wanted to... - Yeah, I've been really busy, man. - Yeah, that's cool. - Yeah, I know. - Listen, man... - Just drop it, dude. Ok. Hey, Shaun. Hey. What's up? I need help! Shaun, this is Cody. Hi Cody, how are you, man? I'm Shaun. I need help. You need help? Uhh, alright... But, dude you've got it all wrong. See, you've gotta fortify the corners of the moat first. "Fourty-fi"? Codes, let's go. I'm not done; I have to "fourty-fi"! Shaun, do you mind looking after Cody for a second? We're cool. Let's go for a walk. No, I don't think I should leave Cody. Come on, Shaun can watch him. You guys go, it's fine. Alright. There we go. This is gonna be a sweet walking bridge. Oh look at that! Shaun's great with Cody. Listen, I'm sorry about the other day. It was stupid. Just make up your mind, Zach. If you don't want to be together then just don't pull that shit on me. Ok. If it's what you want then I'm gonna move on. Alright. You know what that means, right? Yeah, Tori. I know what that means. Just go, ok? Come on, Cody. Time to go. Five more minutes. Shaun rocks. No, Cody. Let's go. Shaun rocks! Can I jump on the sand castle? No, we gotta go. Come on. Hey, the tide's gonna get it anyway. You might as well let him have at it. Go ahead. -Woo! -Weehaa! Alright man, great job! Come on, little man. Sayonara. Hey, I just wanted to talk to you about the other night. What? I think you're really talented. And I don't think you should throw it away. I think you should do something with it. Is that it? Yeah. I'm late. Tori, I'll call... (door slam) (tires squeal) (music) Good morning. What time is it? Why? You got somewhere to go? Yeah. Yeah I gotta go. Wait. Listen, I gotta go. - Hey, Jeannie. - Hey. Where's Cody? Like you care. What are you talking about? Where were you last night? I called you like 3 times. Did you need something? Yeah. I need to know you're there. I'm always there. For Cody. You weren't last night. What do you need, Jeannie? Actually, Alan is going up to Portland this weekend. And um, he's gonna make a bid on a job. He said he'd take me. It would do me so much good to get out of here. - Alan? - Yeah. - Alan? - Uh huh. Can you watch Cody this weekend? Please... You know, I was hoping to have the weekend to myself. Why? Who are you fucking? What? What are you talking about? Come on, I saw you gazing out the window. I know it's not Tori. Who is it? Nobody? Well I guess you're free then. Come on, Zach. You're all I've got. I know. (phone buzzes) Hey. -Hey. Everything cool? Yeah, yeah... -Uh, what are you doin'? Going to work. -Come on over tonight. I'll cook steaks. Uh... I can't. -Come on. I'll make margaritas. -Strong ones. Who is that? No one. Hold on. So you can do it, right? I gotta tell Alan. Fine. -Cool, thanks. Shaun, I can't. -Why? Jeannie's leaving for the weekend and I gotta watch Cody. -So bring him. No. -Why not? You don't care? -No! That kid's great. -He says some funny shit. -Look, I'm turning the grill on at 8. Ok. Come on, dude. I like these! I like these! Nah, you don't want those. I think you should get these. But I want real shoes. But these are way cooler. Ok. Alright, let's go. Hey! Ankle biter! What's up man, how are ya? Are you hungry? Starving! Starvin'? What do you want for dinner? Hey, he'll eat whatever. I don't think I was asking him, was I? - No. - No, I don't think so.

Somehow. - Are we still in California? - Yeah, buddy. Where are you going? I don't think we have that stuff in the house. Seriously, dude. Don't worry about it. -No, I want to. I want to. Little kids are supposed to be spoiled. Besides, I'll be back in like five minutes, ok? I'm gonna go check on him. -Where did Jeanne say she was going? -She's going to Oregon. She thinks there's some job up there worth checking out. I admire what you're doing for Cody. You don't have to. Yeah. I do. It's a choice, Zach. It's family. I'm the only one left. You get that from your mom. Yeah, I know... Lucky me. Come here. What? Come here. I need to go check... He's fine. He's asleep. He's ok. Just come here. You sure you guys don't wanna stay? He doesn't like waking up in strange places. Gets enough of that when I'm not around. Ok. Take this. What is it? CalArts application. Shaun, I'm not going down this road again. Take it.

I thought you were moving into your new place this week. No, no. You know, the thought of... moving into an empty place is just depressing, you know? Yeah? Well it's pretty empty here. You doing alright? Yeah, I'm good. - You sure? - Mhmm. Yeah, I heard it was pretty tough there for a while. Yeah, it was tough. Well don't worry, Romeo. You'll find a new one. Yeah, thanks. So, you ready to hang up your pink Gucci suit and come pal out with your real friends? Yeah, ok. Right on, I'll call Zach. Ok, good, yeah. (door bang) What was that? June's probably cleaning today. But June comes on Tuesdays. Yes she does. Pool guy? I dunno. -You ok? -Yeah. Yeah? You look a bit freaked out. No, I'm just tired. - Alright. - Just tired. There anything good to eat in the fridge or is it stocked with low-carb fag food? I'm fucking starving man. Just a lot of fag food. Yo, burger boy! What up? What are you doing down here? Cherie's back in town for the weekend. Told her I'd come down. Oh yeah? I thought there's plenty of pussy in S.B. Oh yeah. But the girls there are fucking teases man. Whatever. Party's on for tonight. Everyone's coming. We'll go grab a quick surf sesh... and get started. Uh, I'm not off for another half hour. No worries. I already fixed your spare board. Huh? The one you've been keeping at the house. I saw it out back and I fixed it. Grabbed it, patched it all up... Oh yeah, yeah... that board. Man, I left that there a while ago. Whatever. So I'll see you around five at mine? - Ok. - Alright, cool. Nice shirt, by the way. (talking) Dude, so what's the latest? You and Tori really over this time? Yeah. Glad to hear it. It's about time. So what are you doing then? Just playing the field? I talked to a bunch of people and no one sees you anywhere. Everyone's gone man. Yo, there he is! Hey, you lasted pretty long out there, old man. My big bro on a longboard. Never thought I'd see the day. Yeah, Give me 10 years and call me back about that. Yeah, right. I'll never be on a longboard. Ever. Alright, I'm getting beers. What's up, babe? Shaun, what... Shaun, just chill. Hey, Codes. What's wrong? Cody, go to your room for a second. Please tell me that he is just confused. What do you mean? Zach, why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? Ok, your confusion is one thing... But bringing Cody into this is just totally fucked. -I didn't bring him to anything. - You brought him to Shaun! He likes Shaun! Shaun's better than... You know what, forget it. It's not about Shaun, it's about us. It is about our family. What about it? Cody lost his father; He needs you. He needs a positive man in his life. Well I'm sorry I'm no Alan. You don't know shit. Ok. He's a little kid. He's not gonna understand this. You're mother of the fucking year now? -Oh fuck you. -He'd be lost without me! Fuck you, Zach! Zach, are you trying to fuck up our family? Yeah, yeah Jeannie. That's what I'm trying to do. You know, Cody has a sense of family because of me. Mom died and I got the family fucking gene. Oh, I see. So it's the 'family' gene that's making you run off and have your big gay wedding? You gonna make the family proud? Is that what you're scared of? This isn't about Shaun, or me. This is about you being left. You know, I'm the only one who hasn't run off on you. That's sweet. But go ahead, judge me. I don't care. You know, you're right. Ok fine. Yeah, guys have left me. But, Zach, now you are just a Summer fuck, ok? You've reduced yourself to a little piece of ass. So bravo! You are doing really well for yourself. Do you think that is a good upbringing for him? - Yes. - Do you? No, I don't know. I don't know. Well... if it is, do you think you'd have to hide it from me? From Gabe? From Tori? I don't know! I don't fucking know, ok? I just want what's best for Cody. Well, so do I! Sorry. (music) Oh God. (knocking) Hey. I need some time. I just don't know if this is really what I want. It seems like what you want. I just don't know if this is what I want. For good. What's that supposed to mean? It's not as easy for me as it is for you. You know, this is all totally new to me. Look, we'll get through the Gabe thing... No it's not that, Shaun. You just don't get it, ok? I can't just take whatever I want. My life is not like that. You'll never get what you want unless you take it. Take it... You know, You and Gabe have always been able to point and take, no questions asked. You don't realize it's not like that for other people. It's fucking ignorant! Oh and you and Jeanne just blame everyone else because you can't do anything for yourselves? What do you call that? Look... fuck! Why are you doing this? Don't get all emotional and faggy on me, ok? What? I'm sick of being your childhood wet dream, Shaun. Find another fucking fantasy! You know what, you're a fucking coward! I'm done. You're a fucking coward. I'm done. Get out! We're closed! What's up, bro? Good, brother. Fuck, I'm so hungover... Kitchen's closed. Do you want a coffee? Yes, please. So what's up? I'm taking off later today. Never saw you leave last night. - So... - So? Why didn't you tell me? Tell you what? I don't care... at all. I don't know what you're talking about. Have you, have you always known? Seriously, dude. Ok. The fact that it's my brother is totally weird. I know. No, like... really really fucking weird. Alright, I got it. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Don't tell anyone, ok? Ok. So are you going with other guys? No! I heard they give better head. They give better head, don't they? Dude, stop! - They swallow? - Gabe! Do you think he's hot? Shut the fuck up, dude! Fine. - So, where'd you go last night? - I slept in my car. Why didn't you just crash at mine? This doesn't have to change things. Doesn't change things? Yeah, you're right, Gabe. I used to be the guy you came and talked to, remember? Before Shaun. This isn't exactly easy on me. It isn't easy on you, right? You know what? It's over anyways. Just leave it, dude. I've gotta clean up and you've gotta leave. Hey, we're still bros, alright? I mean it. Come here. (music) Can I please just come in and crash? (music continues) Jeannie? What? Have you seen my portfolio? I can't find it anywhere. I don't know. The portfolio I was putting together for CalArts. No, I haven't seen it. - What's today? - Um, I think the 30th. Fuck! Zachy, what are you doing? They turned you down. Why do you wanna put yourself through that again? I just thought I'd give it another shot, you know? Well don't bother. That place is full of rich kid painters and they're all gonna end up working at art stores anyway. Yeah, maybe. They're hiring at the Oceanette. You want me to put in a good word? It's a good job. We could use the money. How come we never see Shaun anymore? Sometimes that happens, Cody. People leave sometimes. Why did he leave? It's complicated. A grown-up thing. Can we say hi to him even though he left? He was cool. No. Sometimes people leave and never come back. Like my daddy? Yes, Cody. Like your daddy. Hey. Hey, Jeannie. Rick is on today. He's a nightmare. So steer clear. Got it. Hey, Cody. Are you ready? Give me the pen. Bye, kiddo.

It's Kelly Burke, from CalArts. Uh, I got your portfolio and your application. Kinda surprised to see that you applied again. But, really happy that you did. So I returned the portfolio to the Ocean Beach address that you sent it from. There's a couple of things I need to go over with you before I can continue with it. So give me a call when you get this. I'm at extension 20, and I hope to hear from you. Alright, take care. To replay, press 4. To erase, press 7. To return this call, press 8. To save, press 9. To hear all other options, press star. (alarm beeping) Jeannie, get up! Get up! What are you doing? Sleeping. Yeah, with some help. Wait, Zach, wait. Allen got that job. Yeah? In Portland and I gotta go with him. I can make good money there, and... But they don't take kids. What do you mean they don't take kids? I don't know. They just don't take kids. Allen's not really into it anyway. Cody's gonna have to stay here with you and Papi... At least until we get set up. With me and dad for how long? I dunno. Six months... a year maybe? You know he can't stay with dad. I know. But he can't come with me. Zach, the Oceanette is not cutting it. I can make three times that up there. Is there any more? Well I'm full, do you want mine? Yeah. I do. You like it? Yeah. - Mom? - Yeah. Can I go to Oregon too? Cody, I told you. You gotta stay here and keep your uncle Zach company so he doesn't get lonely. Can you do that for mommy? (phone ringing) Hello? No, he's not here. Hey, monkey. Hey. I got in. What? To CalArts, they took me back. I don't know how I'll do it. You'll have to figure out a way. If you pass it up You'll be stuck here. I don't feel stuck here. Yes you do. Jeanne wants to go to Oregon. Maybe she'll have to stay. Cody is her responsibility. I can't leave him. Figure it out. Cheer up! Can we just celebrate? There's something I really need to tell you. I already know. I've known for a while. You are the only reason I wish I wasn't. None of this other shit matters. But what really sucks... Is that I've always wanted to be everything to you. Always dreamed of providing you with anything you ever wanted or needed. Do you love him? Oh come on... Seriously. He's a good guy, Zach. You don't belong to people forever. Then why bother? Isn't it worth it? Yeah. - Tori. - Yeah? Can I stay with you just for the night? I have nowhere else to go and I can't face Jeanne. Of course. But you can't fuck me.

You say something. Student was bad. Made bad judgment call. Now see truth. Where are you? Getting warmer... Colder... Turn around. I'm so sorry. You'd better be. You sent in my application? Yeah. Why are you here? What changed? I did. Will you help me? You serious? Of course. Anything. Anything? Yes. I got in. - Full ride. - Yes! I knew it! Are you serious? Yeah, I really wanna go this time. Of course. I turned down the scholarship before. My mom... Cody... everything. I just couldn't walk out. I never told anyone. I really wanna go this time. And you did say you lived close. Well then let's do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm so proud of you, man. So proud. - Shaun! - Hey, kiddo... Allen, take Cody inside, ok? Zach, what is he doing here? What? Are you bailing on me? Bailing? Jeanne, you're the one leaving your son! If you don't like this option then just stay. Five more minutes! Jesus, Cody. Shut the fuck up you... Don't you ever talk to him like that! - Zach! - Allen! -Zach! - That fucking little shit! Take a walk baby, please? For me. Please... Ok, ok. - Easy, easy. - Zach, what the fuck! (kicking sound) Jesus Christ. I'm gonna go inside and check on him. Shaun is really great, Jeanne. He really cares about Cody... and me. If he can't be with you, this is the next best thing. I'm gonna make it work. Jeanne, take a look around. Every kid should be so lucky. What else could you possibly want for him? I got into CalArts. I know. You know? Were you gonna tell me? They told me that you turned it down last time. I'm not going to again. No, you shouldn't. He'll be fine with us... Or stay, it's your choice. Zach, if this thing with Allen doesn't work out... It's best that he's here with you. He's in good hands I promise. Yeah.
