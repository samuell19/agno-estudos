(slow church music) - David Michael Whitcom. - [Voiceover] Once there was a soldier in the great war. - Congratulations. - [Voiceover] Assigned to a small battlefield called Hurrah, Iowa. (happy, marching band music) (flame blowing) (mysterious music, alarm sounding) The enemy also sent in his warriors to the same battlefield. (marching band music) (whistle blowing) Each one picked for his specific talents. (galactic beaming sounds) Each one armed with specialized weapons. (heroic band music) (church bells ringing) One took up his position for the war. And the others took up their location, and dug in. ♫ I am the good shepherd ♫ The chosen of men (mysterious music) ♫ I've called you to battle ♫ Today it begins (mysterious music) ♫ So hear now your shepherd ♫ Your strength comes from me (mysterious music) ♫ The victory will set them free (mysterious music) ♫ For eternity (phone beeping) (flame blowing) - Well, I wish Pastor Peters would've stayed for my first service tomorrow. - Well, he did have to give up his golf day just to get away. - I appreciate his sacrifice. - He left you these. (paper rustling) These are cancellations for all the Sunday School teachers tomorrow. (sighing) Are all the mice deserting a sinking ship? - You mean, rats. - I was practicing Christian forbearance. Who's gonna teach Sunday School tomorrow? - You still have me. - [Pastor David] Why do we only have one Sunday School teacher out of a membership of a hundred? - You know how the bible talks about the shepherd who leaves his 99 to go and find his one lost sheep? - Luke 15: 4-7. - Well you have to go and find the 99. (laughing) The bible isn't funny. The Lord doesn't like pastors to be funny. - Well, I know now why Pastor Peters played so much golf. - The Lord is a very serious business, Pastor Whitcom. - The Lord has a great since of humor. - Where does it say that in the bible. - Genesis 1:27. So God created man. (trumpet blowing funny tune) (sighing) - Well, his sheep are nothing but paper lions. (laughing) There won't be more then a handful in church tomorrow. - Ahh, you've done a grand job here, Belzee. You certainly deserve a rest. - No, Abaddon, they deserve the credit themselves, unfortunately. This has always been a lukewarm church. There was never much work for me here. - Terrific. Then what were we sent here for? - Bureaucratic red tape, no doubt. - I was informed of my transfer when the new preacher accepted his assignment. - Well, he's, young and foolish. Should be easy to corrupt him. - [Guy with Cap] I had an assignment once, when I thought the same thing. His name was David too, and he was laughed at by a lot of people for being ambitious. - [Voiceover] Well, what happened. - He killed Goliath with one stone. I must be leaving now, Abaddon. Never underestimate the enemy like I did, or else you'll end up spending your eternity in backwater parishes, watching bad golf like me. (explosion thundering) (coughing) - [Computer Demon] He's incredible. Nobody disappears like that anymore. - Well, he's had a run of unfortunate assignments. I've known him for centuries. - Having that first David for an assignment, was unfortunate. - Especially when it was followed by Saul of Tarsus, Frances of Assisi, and Martin Luther. (explosion thundering) (golf clubs rattling) (explosion thundering) - Old demons never die. They just, flame way. (snare drum rolling) - I guess you must feel like a shepherd whose flock has been taken over by the wolf. - Well, I would've like to have had a chance at the wolf with my slingshot, before he got the sheep. (door clicking open) Martha? Would you like some coffee? - Uh, no, I was just leaving for the day. - [Pastor David] I'll see you in Sunday School. (door knocking shut) - I know I'm supposed to be the chairman of the board of deacons, David. I should have better control over the situation. But it was just announced yesterday. - Well, does the wolf have a name? - Yes, and it's very fitting too. - [Voiceover] Phil Esteem. (laughing) (computer beeping outputs) (keyboard clicking) (laughing) (computer beeping outputs) Oh, this man is almost worthy of being a demon. - Here now, watch your language. - No, Im serious, Andar. This Phil Esteem employs three quarters of the people that work in this town. Seems the local power company is running short of power weekdays, so he changed the work week for his employees to Wednesday through Sunday. (laughing) - Excellent! - So? - So they have to work on Sunday. Oh, Andor, no Church! - [Andor] Oh! Very good. - Liar, look up the particulars on this Phil Esteem on your machine. See if he has help from one of us. Or if he's on his own. - Well, he must be getting help from someone in the organization. He is human. - Yes, he's human. Uh, he's working alone without a demon partner. Doesn't seem to need one. - He's about to get three. - Yes, but from these readouts, I can't really see how we can improve on an already very successful project. - Why don't you ask that mechanical monster of yours why we're wasting our time here, then. - Not a bad idea. For the military. (keyboard clicking) - [Andar] Well? - Here it comes. David. Michael. Whitcom. - [Andar] David Michael Whitcom. - My name is David Michael Whitcom, and I'm your new pastor. (organ piping slowly) I'm glad that you children are in church today. Instead of in Sunday School classes. Lotta time in churches the kids are separated from the adults too much, and the Lord especially loved little children. Matthew 18:3 he said, "Unless you change, and become like little children, you'll never enter the kingdom of heaven." One day, people tried to push the kids away from Jesus, because they thought that kids would bother and interrupt him. But he wouldn't let them do that. Said in Mark 10:14, "Let the little children come unto me, "and do not stop them. "For the kingdom of God belongs to such as these." They know that salvation is God's gift of eternal life to you. Course, you have to take the gift, and you have to turn from lying, cheating, sinful things, and turn to Jesus Christ, God's son. (demon whooshing) And when you do that, get your gift of eternal life. All sounds easy doesn't it? 'Cause we know how wonderful Jesus Christ is. But he has a deadly enemy. He has a whole army that works for them, to keep adults and children from the Lord. They work hard on us, as they're on the losing side. (hard gulping) (mysterious music) (happy, epic music) They use all their weapons to keep us from the Lord. They make things look prettier, and nicer, and sweeter, And, more fun that good. They work very hard to do this, 'cause they hate all human beings. You know why? Because we can spend our eternal life with Jesus, and he gave his chance away. And he can never have it again. So that's why he hates us so much. Misery loves company. What's the enemy's most powerful weapon? Discouragement. Remember, when you think you can't be good anymore, and you wanna give up, you must be close to the Lord. 'Cause the devil's thrown in his most important weapon to get you. - Think they'll believe him? - Rarely do humans believe the truth. (laughing) - [Pastor David] As adults we sometimes forget what Jesus says in Mark 10:15. (mellow snoring) "Anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God, "like a little child, "shall not enter it." Let's all come to him with our hearts open like little children. If you have not received Jesus as your savior, do it now. Ask him to forgive you your sins. Ask him, (dial tones beeping) to make you clean again, with the blood that he shed for you, on the cross. Invite him into your heart. And become a part of the family of God forever. Will you do that? (whooshing appearance, grunting) - Andor? - I know it's old fashion, but being around that rattle talk always makes me nauseous. (door clicking) - The computer was right about that man, Lile. - Yeah, looks like it. - We better concentrate on the adults for a while. Esteem has laid some healthy groundwork there we can capitalize on. - But children are higher priority I thought. - Andor, don't think, okay. It's too fatiguing on that military mind of yours. Now, don't you see the children will follow their own, natural instincts if we just get rid of the adult interference. - Never underestimate the enemy. Get back in there, Andor, and tell those children to resist. - Please, I'm not well. - [Abaddon] Now! (whimpering) - Yes, sir. (sighing) - There's one, slight problem with an atheist. - What problem? At least an atheist doesn't believe in our enemy. - That's the problem. - I don't understand. - He doesn't believe in us either. - We ask, Father, as always, that we remain true to our scriptural model as always. Matthew 19:19, "Love your neighbor, "as yourself." Now! The most important matter for this meeting is to stop Phil Esteem from interfering with our Sunday services. For as it says in the bible, if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. We need to cut Phil Esteem out of our society, just like it says in the bible. - [Members] Amen! Hallelujah! - Well, like it says in the bible, we don't wanna cut off our nose to spite our faces. Do we? - What chapter and verse is that. Thomas? - Phil Esteem does a lot of good for this town. Look at the bell tower he built for us. - Yeah, and look at good he's done for your bank. - I resent that, Gabriel Lared. - I apologize, Thomas. - [Pastor David] Have any of you tried to talk to Mr. Esteem? - It wouldn't do any good. - He doesn't listen to anyone. (grunting) - [Gabriel] I tried to talk to him, but he informed me that no half baked, farmer type like me could know anything about the problems of industry. - Well, that's probably true, Gabe. In my business however, got to know a great deal about a lot of things. - Thomas, you've never done a days work in your life with your hands. - Now, like Phil Esteem, I use my brains. I let others do the brawn work. See, that's what brains are for. - You mean, you make money off of other people's work. - Have any of the other churches in town communicated with us about Mr. Esteem? - [Everyone] Other churches? (laughing) - Since I was supposed to deliver a short homily, I think we'll begin with Romans 12:10. "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love." (thought provoking music) - I say James 4:4! - I disagree. It's Second Thessalonians 3:15! - First Corinthians 6:10! - I think First Corinthians 6:10! - You must mean Luke 13:24! - No! He means Galatians 5:19! - No! He means Galatians 5:19! - You're joking! Philippians 3:18! - I repeat, Matthew 5:44! - You are in error! - Throw First John 2:6 or Romans 13:13 at him! - Put Romans 13:13 in your pipe and smoke it! - Smoking is sin! - [Voiceover] Yes, Romans 6:15! (loud chattering) - First Corinthians 14:40. "Let all things be done decently, and in order." - Well, they come up with a plan? - Have they come up with a plan? They barely agreed to sit down. - Eight of them, might influence Esteem. - Ah, no, no. Half of 'em don't wanna be seen with the other half. Soon they'll begin arguing about sprinkling, dipping or immersion, and they'll all leave mad. - [Voiceover] No one will deny Psalm 1:6. - That may be true, but that doesn't invalidate Psalms 7:11. - That's giving it to them, Claude! Matthew 5:29! (hand smacking table) - Ah, here that? Ah, David Whitcom will have to face Esteem alone, and he'll be eaten alive. - Maybe. - What is the matter with you? - I had a colonel once, who said the very same thing about a man called Daniel. - So. - [Andor] He's a private now. - Good point, Andor, but that lion didn't have the three of us. Esteem has. - Couldn't we just John 13:34? - [Voiceover] That hardly seems possible! And furthermore, Psalms 15:2! (hand smacking table) - Amen, that's giving it to them! First Corinthians 5:13! (hand smacking table) - Only a fool would believe we could ever get together! We're miles apart doctrinally. (chattering) (door clicking open) - [Pastor David] I thought we could work together in the Lord. - Only if we're never in the same room. (door slamming) - Happens every time. (laughing) - Shouldn't we work with her? She has some good instincts. - [Abaddon] No, no, you work with her mother. - Hut two, three, four. Hut, two, three, four. (marching band music) - Pastor Whitcom, have you come to join us? - No, I've come to talk with Mr. Esteem, Mrs. Salem. - Hmm, I always thought actions spoke louder than words. - Aren't you ladies on Mr. Esteem's property? - All land belongs to the Lord, Pastor Whitcom. (marching band music) - Pastor Whitcom, Mr. Esteem is expecting you. - Don't be afraid. I don't eat young preachers. (laughing) Just that I need a machete to make my way through this carpet. - The wicked do flourish like the green bay tree. - Mr. Esteem. - You came alone? - [Abaddon] Not really. - Not really. - Sit down, young man. Now what do you want from me? I'm an atheist, so don't ask for donations. - I came to talk to you about the new work week, and its problems. - [Mr. Esteem] What problems? We solved our problems with the new work week. - Mr. Esteem, you're being picketed by some ladies already. (laughing) Jesse Salem and her coven of witches? Many of the Christians in this community would rather put in their eight additional hours over the week, and have Sundays free. Would you consider that alternative? - Young man, Riverown has invited me to relocate in their town where there's plenty of power from the river. Have you and your Christians considered that alternative? - Oh, I like his style. - Mm-Hmm. - [Pastor David] You had several possibilities other than working on Sunday. You deliberately picked the Lord's day. - What are you going to do, strike me with lightning? (laughing) The best thing that could happen to this town, is to bring 'em out of the dark ages of superstition into the modern world. And young men like you might have to work for a living. - A hit on target. - [Pastor David] I see. And you are going to lead the people of Hurrah into a bright, new world of tomorrow? - You might say that. I consider myself a good influence in this town. - An influence for? - [Mr. Esteem] A leader who can show them the good in science, technology and modern thought. Your Christian theology has imprisoned their minds for years. (chuckling) - I see. New gods for old. - And what has your god done for these people that science can't do? - Try, eternal life. - [Mr. Esteem] I believe in what I can see. - [Pastor David] You believe in the atom don't you? - [Mr. Esteem] I can see evidence under a microscope. - [Pastor David] Well, I can see evidence of the Lord in the universe. - [Mr. Esteem] You are mad. All you preachers are demented. The week stays as it is. (door buzzing) And don't come to me with anymore of your complaints, preacher. I haven't time for that nonsense. - [Pastor David] I'm sorry your time is so short. - [Mr. Esteem] I only have time for important things, preacher. - So many people have said that. - What? - [Pastor David] Cain, King Saul, Goliath, Herod. Judas Iscariot. (suspenseful music) (door clicking shut) - Hmm. He might be dangerous if he grows up. I think we're about to have a little help here. (phone ringing) - [Mr. Esteem] Yes? Why should I care if you have to water the lawn today? What women? Oh, yes. The women. It's my property, do it! (humorous marching band music) - Pastor Whitcom, what did he say? - Well. (voices chattering and screaming) (funny music) - An eye for an eye. - Revenge is mine, sayeth the Lord. - The Lord helps those who help themselves. (funny, slow music) (water splashing) (water dripping) (door slamming shut) (car rumbling) (church bells ringing) (door slamming shut) (door clicking shut) (door clicking open) (key rattling) (mellow piano tune) - Mmm. (dial pad clicking) (grunting) Thomas, I need to know about that loan the Salems took out to fix their roof. How much more do they owe on it? Ha? Oh, I see. Well, this is what I want you to do. - [Mrs. Salem] You can't do that, Thomas Downs. You can't force us to do that. (mellow snoring) No. No, I, I, don't want that. Tell Mr. Esteem to send the car repair bill to me. We'll be in the bank soon. To extend our loan to pay for it. No. (sighing) I understand. (phone knocking) - How is she going to cause trouble now? Esteem has her checkmated. - Yes. He has such a wonderfully, slimy mind. - Mm-Hm. (laughing) I can hardly wait 'til he joins us at home. (laughing) Oh, and give her a hint. (mellow snoring) - There's always, poison pen letters. (bell ringing) (paper rustling) (snoring rumbling) (paper rustling) (church pipe organ tune) (trumpet honking) (grunting) (grunting) - [Crowd Of Women] Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! (food splattering) Give us back our Sundays! Give us back our Sundays! (paper rustling) (paper ripping) (funny tune) ♫ God will take care of you ♫ Through every day ♫ For all the way ♫ He will take care of you ♫ God will take care of you - Ah, there's nothing like a fresh breath of dissension to clear the air. - Bracing! - Invigorating! - [Woman With Red Hair] I'm telling you, that man should be punished. - Assassination. - Assassination. Uh, I mean, we should get up in association. - But I say, a man's church should not interfere in his work. And I say, a man's work should not interfere in his religion. - And I say, - [Andor] Drop dead. - Drop dead. (fist smacking) (fruit thudding) (voices chattering) - Superb weather! - Bracing! - Yes, invigorating! (chattering, grunting and screaming) (funny, hypnotic noises) (mellow snoring) - Gabe Lared is a little late, but we should begin. (door slamming) - There she is. She's a good old girl. Got a lotta years to go. Isn't she pretty? - She surely is. She's a answer to prayer. (car roaring) - [Pastor David] Now, let's see what the Lord had to say about fighting mong ourselves. What causes fights and quarrels among you? Don't they come from your desires that battle within you? You want something, but you don't get it. You kill and covet, but you cannot have what you want. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask God. When you ask, you do not receive, 'cause you ask with the wrong motives, that you may spend what you get on your pleasures. The book of James is wonderful for its ability to put its finger on human nature. He warns us about judging our neighbor, when there's only one lawgiver and judge. Tells us not to grumble against each other, brothers. For you will be judged. Look, we are Christians in trouble, and what have we done? We attack the enemy full of hatred against God's law. We've grieved, and mourned and wailed "unfair," and we never asked for his help. - [Voiceover] Wait a minute, Pastor, we all prayed. - [Crowd] Yes, we did. - Well, if we believe that God would help us, then why did we attack Mr. Esteem, and each other at the first trial of faith in Hurrah? We didn't persevere in the faith; any of us, for one week. If our prayers weren't answered, perhaps we should look at our motives. The bible promised that the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective. So let's pray now, with humble hearts, and ask His help. - He does that more than any other preacher I know. If this keeps up I'm gonna be a wreck. (crickets chirping) (car door slamming) - Well, I'd certainly hate to be the demon assigned to that James character that creep keeps quoting. Why, that demon must've been transferred to outer Mongolia. - That demon was transferred to a desert in Arabia, for almost 2,000 years. - He deserved it. - I would've sent him to Siberia. - Really? We'll remember that if you fail here. - Oh I, - [Abaddon] I'd shut up if I were you. (gasping) - Oh, that's bad. He looked happy. - You two go on in there. I'm gonna check on Esteem. - I (gasping) can't. - You wanna get transferred to Siberia? (whimpering) - [Voiceover] You fool! You not only let James become an apostle, you let him write that disgusting book! You idiot! You let him help save thousands of humans! Be gone, to the Arabian desert! Stay there until I can bare the sight of you again! (chaotic, unpleasant tune) - Help us this day, and every day, to worship and praise you in our hearts. We ask this in Jesus name, amen. - [Crowd] Amen. - I think the Lord has answered our prayers. Green County Hospital is selling a 500 kilowatt generator, that will provide electricity for a factory that hires 800 people, from Hurrah. (cheering and applauding) - [Pastor David] Thank you, Lord, for a solution. (door clicking shut) (phone ringing) - Yes. Oh, Thomas. What? What? You're joking! Nah, I know. You never joke. A generator? Are you sure? Oh, I underestimated Gabe Lared. No, don't you worry, Thomas. I'll take care of it. (phone clicking) (hynoptic noise) (laughing) (festive music blaring, hands clapping) (people cheering) (voices chattering) (distant, festive music) (festive music blaring) (hypnotic tune) (hypnotic tune) (hypnotic tune) - Couldn't even get the women to start a good gossip session. - It's impossible to tempt them when they think they're enjoying themselves in a good cause. - Don't worry. Here comes some help now. (festive music) - Mr. Esteem. - [Mr. Esteem] Well, that pie looks very good. - Well, have a piece. - Ah, thank you. - [Pastor David] Ah, that'll be a contribution for the new generator. - Yes, yes. - Thank you. - [Voiceover] Attention! Attention! (trumpet music) - We have just passed the $10,000 mark. (crowd applauding and cheering) (clearing his throat) - My good people of Hurrah. I too am concerned with the loss of your weekends, due to the power shortage. Now I thought your idea of a generator was a brilliant solution. Unfortunately, when I informed the power company of our plans, I was told, that if we hold on to two days of their fees, we will be penalized. And my bills will be higher. Now, you all know how I love this town, but business is business. So, unless we go on as we are, for the sake of the factory, I would be forced to move, to Rivertown, where the power from the river is free. And we do not have any potential employee difficulties. (funny, drooping sound) (laughing) - Well, like it says in the bible, there's no use crying over spilled milk. Maybe we can change our services to another day. (water splashing) - Oh! Well, like it says in the bible, Mr. Downs. - [Gabe] Its not the power company he's worried about, it's the power of God. - [Pastor David] Whaddaya mean, Gabe? - I've never met an atheist yet who wasn't mad at God about something? Esteem would try t plow Christians under if he could. Why? Why should he try to destroy something that he doesn't believe in? - That's very interesting. - It's the truth that'll set you free. - The truth is, you know nothing about factory problems. - Human problems have been with us for thousands of years. The place doesn't change that. - I'm sorry to put a spoke in your wheel, preacher. - I can see your penitence. (laughing) Some people have to be dragged screaming and kicking into the enlightened age, but they'll make it. Thanks to me, they'll be new science books in the schools. (laughing) Isn't it in Job, about, they'll be groping in darkness with no light? - You quote scripture with some familiarity. - Even the devil, hey Thomas? - Hmm, yes, certainly. - The light each man should follow is his own intellect. His ability to think! - I see. A man should follow his own light, like Genghis Khan? Attila? Hitler? I wonder, Mr. Esteem. Do you know Luke 11:35? (suspenseful music) See to it then that the light within you is not darkness. (door clicking) (mellow, sad music) - [Belzee] Fail! - [Pastor David] Forgive me, Father. - [Belzee] Fail! - [Pastor David] Maybe I should listen to my own, preaching about your will. - [Abaddon] Fail! - [Pastor David] I should've checked out the generator situation before letting them get their hopes up to be dashed down again. Poor Esteem. Slugged him with that scripture and walked off. (demons hissing) I did just the was he expected of a preacher. Forgive me, Lord, for failing you. I failed the people. - [Abaddon] Fail! I failed a soul in trouble. - Fail. - [Pastor David] I failed my calling in your name. - Fail. - My sermon verse for Sunday. What hypocrisy, me preaching. - Fail. - [Pastor David] You're God, my strong hold. Why have you rejected me? Why must I go about mourning, oppressed by the enemy? - [Abaddon] Fail. - [Pastor David] Send forth your light and your truth. (demons grunting) Let them guide me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain, to the place where you dwell. Then when I go to the alter of God, to God, my joy and my delight. Lord, send me your light and your truth. Let me help these people. (mellow music) Guide us in your will, and not let us be oppressed by the enemy. Do not let us make enemies of those we were sent to help. (knocking at the door) (sighing) (door clicking) Peter! - David. You forgot I was coming. - Yes. (laughing) - That's alright. You used to do that in the seminary all the time. The hours I spent in the library waiting for my absent minded roommate. How are ya? - I'm in trouble. I'll tell you 'bout it over some coffee. (door shutting) (door shutting) So what are you doing now? - After I dropped out of the seminary I cleverly went to work for my father. - I forgot what he does. - Smith, Smith, Smith & Johnson? (laughing) Well, we're the. - Peter. (light switch clicking) I just remembered what he does. You're a miracle. - Ha? - Come on. (exciting music) (door clicking shut) I came to apologize for last night at the Bizarre. - Apologize for comparing me to Genghis Khan? - I came to ask forgiveness for my rudeness. - Now, now, preacher. As it says in your proverbs, even a fool is thought wise if he keep silent. - There's a better one for me. A fool finds no pleasure in understanding, but delights in airing his own opinion. - Perhaps you're guilty of zeal without knowledge. It's a common fault in your profession. There might be hope for you as a man if you'd see the light. - [Pastor David] I could say the same for you. - [Mr. Esteem] We're talking about different lights. I believe in the spirit of man. - The lamp of the Lord searches the spirit of a man. It searches out his inmost being. - You're a fool, Whitcom. There's no lamp, there's no Lord. Your god does not exist! - Then why do you hate him so much if he doesn't exist? - [Mr. Esteem] If e does, his cruelty is a sin against man! - Ah, I see. The Lord's discipline for you was painful. And you lost heart, and you turned away from him. - This conversation is ridiculous. One day, preacher, you'll realize that the god you believe in is destructive. You'll find yourself disabled, rather than healed by your faith. And it'll be too late. - My dear brother, only a god who loves us would discipline us like a father. - I had a father. He believed in your god. And your god killed him! - The son of God shed his blood for you. - [Mr. Esteem] Don't gimme that trash! I heard it all as the son of a preacher, and I don't wanna hear it anymore! Get out! (suspenseful music) - You may have turned away from him, Mr. Esteem, but he never turned away from you. - Out! - I'm sorry I didn't have the right words to help. A wounded spirit is hard to bear, especially when you won't go to the only physician. (door clicking) You shared something important with me, and I appreciate it. - And what is that? - You're not an atheist, Mr. Esteem. (door clicking) - What did he say about the power company? - I didn't have a chance to get it in. I was going to apologize and tell him about it when he became upset. - What's he going to do? - [Pastor David] Suffer. As he has been for a long time. - We still going to our meeting? - Yes, Peter. I think through you, God's power is going to be felt at the power company. (snare drum music) - I thought you might like to know that the Reverend Whitcom and some other people are on the way to the power company, sir. - Thank you. (phone buttons clicking) Put me through to Madding. This is Phil Esteem. - Don't worry, Phil. They aren't going to talk me into a generator or anything else. They're here now, bye. (snare drum music) I have ten minutes folks, and then I have a meeting. - That's sufficient. If Mrs. Salem may be seated. Gabe, David. Now, Mr. Madding, I represent the firm of Smith, Smith, Smith & Johnson. Perhaps you're familiar with the company. - You set up municipal electric systems, and service them. - Obviously, setting up their own electric company is a viable solution to Hurrah's problem. - [Mr Madding] Nonsense. Now we have a very real shortage of power here, Mr.? - Johnson. - Power is available by simply adjusting the time factors as Mr. Esteem has done. - [Peter Johnson] Not acceptable to the majority of citizens of Hurrah. - Definitely not acceptable. - If you attempt to set up your own company, ma'am and gentlemen, you will want to use our equipment, which is already in service. The cost would be nearly $300,000. (funny trumpet tune) You must recognize the economic disadvantages. - Oh, on the contrary. We would use our own contractors. You would be forced to remove all your equipment, which would then be rendered useless to you. For an approximate cost of $250,000. (funny trumpet tune) - [Gabe] It seems to us, Mr. Madding, that the lost of revenue for two days is a bargain, compared to the lost of revenue for an entire town. - We may have a solution to your power problem. And ours. - A uh, generator? - A generator. - A generator? - But you assured me. I don't care if. What? A municipal electric system? I see. I see, well. Very well. (phone clicking) (happy trumpet music) I seriously underestimated that young man. - That makes two of us. (cheering and clapping) (festive marching band music) (festive marching band music) hypnotic, galactic sound) (people chattering) (people chattering) (people cheering and clapping) (triumphant band music) - Mr. Esteem. Mr Esteem. The Lord can light your way back again if you'd only ask. - He made me dwell in darkness. Like those long dead. - And the light shineth in the darkness. (mysterious organ music) (door slamming) - We can show them. You have enough in the little black book to ruin the whole town. (thought provoking music) (paper rustling) (slapping sound) (church bells ringing) - Well, I promise you I won't ask you to work on your next holiday. - Hey, I wouldn't shepherd's hook to get bent out of shape. (feet shuffling) - [Peter] The flock is back in church. Why the long face. Ah, you're worried about the wolf still on the prowl. - More likely a sheep that thinks he's a wolf. - You sure it isn't a wolf that you think is a sheep? - Nah, judge not. - [Peter] You better keep your animals straight. One of these days you're gonna put your hand out to the wrong animal and, - Have faith. - Have common sense. Be sure the Lord is leading you, David - Peter. - You may want a perfect tally for your flock. The Lord, he has his reason for keeping the wolves at bay. - Esteem may be a different sheep from all the rest. I don't think he's really a wolf. - Yeah? A wolf is a wolf, even in black sheep's clothing. The Lord wants all his sheep through the gate. - [Peter] Yeah, but you can't pen up the wolf with the sheep. (sighing) I wish I could be here to make sure that sheep's bleat isn't a bark. I'll keep praying, but let me know the results. (door clicking) Goodbye, ole shepherd of the mid-west hills. (car cranking) - Thanks. - Sure. (church bells ringing) (crickets chirping) (mellow music) - [Mr. Esteem] In the path where I walk, men have hidden a, a snare for me. - [Pastor David] The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Whom shall I be afraid? - The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life. Of whom then, shall I be afraid? (grunting painfully) I go to the Father now. Dear Lord. Don't worry. Peace be with you. He'll, he'll never leave you. (coughing) He'll never. - Dad! Dad! Dad! - And that's how he let his servant die. The moment, the very moment, he was quoting his favorite psalm. - The Lord loved your father. Don't you know the rest of that psalm? - Why would I? To memorize my father's last helpless thoughts? - It goes on to say, one thing I ask of the Lord. This is what I seek, that I may dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life. To gaze upon the beauty of the Lord. - Are you saying that my father wanted to die? No, he wanted to live forever with the Lord. - So he died? - Death is the gateway to eternity, Mr. Esteem. Your father certainly wasn't afraid of it. He was trying to quote Hebrews 13:5. Didn't you recognize it? Never will I leave you. Never will I forsake you. - He did leave me! - You blame the shepherd because a sheep ran away? - He let me go! He let me get separated. (pages rustling) - For I am convinced, neither death, nor life, neither angels nor demons, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God, that is in Christ Jesus, our Lord. - And if I wanted to come back? - You follow the shepherd's lantern back to the light. The lantern your father showed you when you were a boy. The word of God. - The bible. (mellow music) David. Would you light me a few matches? - First John 1:9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just, and will forgive us our sins, and purify us from all unrighteousness. - I see. This sheep has been going his own way. Now turn around and come back to the flock. (mellow music) (galactic noise and whooshing) - The switch is turned on, and the generator's power illuminates the darkness. In a greater way, this book, the Word of God, lights our way to Christ. Our savior, our shepherd. Let's turn now, to Second Peter 1:19, for some final words. And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you would do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts. Let us pray. Dear Father, thank you for giving us the light, your word. Use it to open our eyes today. Help us to see Jesus clearly, and acknowledge him as Savior and Lord. Amen.

Yes, sir. Ah, yes, sir. (flame blowing) Yes, sir. Oh, oh, oh, oh yes, sir. We're all well aware of that. But after all, sir, losing the first battle is not losing the war. (laughing) Yes, sir. Yes, sir. ♫ Blessed Jesus, bless Jesus ♫ Thou hast loved us, love us still - Yes, sir. (flame blowing) (dial tone) (hypnotic music) - Well? He says we can have another chance, but if we fail again, for our next assignment we'll be wearing snow shoes. - Then it is Siberia. - He also would like a little more devotion from his demons, or, - Or? - He'll make us all into pilot lights for hot water heaters. ♫ I am the good shepherd - We'll not underestimate our enemy again. ♫ The shepherd of love - The next battle, will be ours. (hypnotic music) (happy, marching band music)
