How about you help me... (The Thinker) At the very least, I am a fine steed who hasn't found the right jockey. Where is my jockey? CHU Yue-Po! Isn't he supposed to be in jail? How come you're here already? I escaped today If it wasn't for my commission, I would have revealed long ago that we stole the painting together. I know that you value loyalty but I already sold that painting. I really sold that painting. Do you think that I'm like you? No father, no mother, you just have to worry about yourself.

But I have a girlfriend and I've just knocked her. Go to hell! You got the wrong idea. Didn't you just asked Chian-Ren to return the painting to me, right? After taking it back, I was very angry so I ran upstairs and took off my bathrobe. After taking it off, I pondered on a chair I sat like that... I opened and Yue-Po was there I turned my head, and he's in front of me again and we started fighting, wresting... and then, BOOM! The End. I see, so you two were the ones I ratted on for stealing the painting. What? No, I'm just kidding. You're such a good painter, right? Then you can paint a fake "Answer" painting and take it to Champion Gallery in Malaysia. Look for HU Ching to help you broker it. Doesn't it solve all your problems?

Outside the pavilion, by the side of the old road, the grass is green and lush. The evening wind brings echoes of the flute, the sun sets behind the mountains. Mr. CHU, "Answer" is currently the hottest painting on the market. Of course we have buyers but. Are you sure It's real? Of course It's real. Mr. CHU, It's best if you are honest with me I'm helping you with this, so It's as if I was tying my existence to yours. We can make money together. Of course. And we shoulder responsibilities together. Sure. Mr. CHU, What's wrong? I have to go to the bathroom. CHU Chung-Tian, you don't soar when It's time and you soar when It's not the time. Ah.

Alright, don't go thinking too much. Hurry up and dress nicely, we're meeting a client today. OK... I'll be over soon. She undressed me but didn't take off my shorts. Ching-Ching, if this painting is found after evaluation to be a fake you know retribution will be severe. Of course I know, I wouldn't dare tricking you, Mr. CHANG.

To our partnership. Thank you Mr. CHANG. See you soon. Alright. I kiss you goodbye, in the frenzy of the night. My heart readies itself for sorrows I'm sorry. Does it mean that "Answer" is. The painting is. A fake. It's fake, then. Where is the real one? I already took care of it. The real painting is with my father. So the painting is with your father. I don't know. My father is already dead. He probably left it to his spendthrift son to sell at a loss. So the painting is with his son I don't know. OK, It's alright you said you took care of it. How did you take care of it? OK, so is the painting was with your father or It's with his son? I don't know. How can you not know? Mr. CHU, say something, stop kidding, Mr. CHU. Mr. CHU, say something. Mr. CHU, at least make a sound, alright? Make a sound! And suddenly I discovered your face. You were a stranger, nothing will be as before Miss. Yes, can I help you? What is the fastest way to get to Malaysia from here? By plane, many people in Singapore go to Malaysia by plane. Is there a cheaper way? Yes, can you walk in those shoes? You want me to walk to Malaysia? No... Here, walk outside. There is a taxi stand. Next to it, there is a traffic light. After crossing the traffic light, there is an overpass. After the overpass, you will see an auntie that sells newspapers. Don't ask her, She's troublesome. Ask her son instead. Behind her son, there will be a sign. On the sign, you'll see "Bus to Malaysia here". Don't take it, It's run by a swindler. Walk 30 to 35 meters. There will be a big sign. You'll see "Bus to Malaysia". That's the real thing. Enjoy your trip. If you can't find it, come back and ask me, OK? This is a simple age. Nothing I can do were crying all the time we are forgetting our identity. In this modern society.
