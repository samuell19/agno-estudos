[WIND GUSTING] [VEHICLE PASSING] [TIRES SQUEALING] Hi. Can I have some mashed potatoes, please? No protein? No thanks. No meat. Mm-mm. MOTHER: What? - [GROANING] - What's wrong? Spit it out. - Shit. Did you bite into it? - No. - Sure? - Look. No. - This shit really gets me. - Mom, it's fine. Forget it. Seriously? And if you were allergic? You want mine? No, thanks. MOTHER: My daughter had meat. It's unacceptable. We're vegetarians. [INAUDIBLE] Wow, it looks shabbier. Don't you think? Is that it? No, that's the med faculty. Hospital on the left, morgue next to it. And the grocery store, look. I'm already lost. - You have your phone? - Yeah. Call your sister. She may answer for you. I'm going. She won't come. Are you nuts? We're not leaving Juju on her own! She said she'd pick her up. - Wait a bit, she may come. - So, brainiac, show' em what you can do. OK? See you. - I love you, baby. - Mmm - Call me. - Yeah. - Love you too, Mommy. - [CAR ENGINE STARTS] [MEN SHOUTING AND CHEERING INDISTINCTLY] [BANGING] - [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] - [DOOR OPENS] What's that shit music? - Beats me. Who are you? - Roommate. I got here late. Up! - You're not a girl. - Nope. - I asked for a girl. - They gave you a fag, same deal for them. - Here, take this. - What's going on? What's this? A ski pole. - [DOOR BANGS OPEN] - [ALL CLAMORING] [CLAMORING CONTINUES] That's my shit! Hey! Where are you going? Where? - Bed, man. - Bed? Where? Your bed's downstairs, friend. [LAUGHS] Check it. This one wants out already! You got in to please your parents, right? - I thought it was over. - You'll know if it's over, big guy. Get back in line. Get in line. And now, where are we headed? Where? - To freedom! - ADRIEN: Fuck off! - Fuckers! - ALL: Speed it up, rookies! Assholes. Get up! Move your asses! Hurry, the boss is waiting. - Move it! - BOY: Come on, guys. [ALL CLAMORING] Faster, rookies! Move down! [CLAMORING CONTINUES] Move your asses! You! You stay put. Go. Go. Move it. Move it. Rookies, move it! Get moving, go, go! Hey, it's just a game. What do you think could happen? I'm Adrien. Justine. [INAUDIBLE] [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Slut it up, girls. You're the slut. [ALL LAUGHING AND SHOUTING] - [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] - [ALL SHOUTING] Alex! Alex! I'm so wasted. - Where were you? - Mom and Dad will kill you. It's so cool you're here. You'll love it. The first year is the best. And we'll see each other all the time, like at home. Is my thong out of my shorts? You're fine. - Mom got to you, I see. Was it hell without me? - What do you mean? [RETCHING] Fuck. I need some fresh air. Quicky! Long time, no see! [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] - JUSTINE: Where's the light? - ALEXIA: Don't. We're not allowed in here. JUSTINE: Where are we? Alex? Where do I go now? - [THUD] - Fuck, bumped my eye! - [SCREAMS] - [ALEXIA LAUGHS] - Where are you? - Ugh. [ALEXIA LAUGHING] - [HISSES] - JUSTINE: Stop it! Look. - Some heads are cut off. - Traitors. They refused initiation. Here it is, come look. Who's that? [LAUGHS] No way. They wouldn't do that kind of thing. - It's tradition. You will too, right. - Really? - Don't be a wimp. Even Mom looks happy. - [BOTH CHUCKLE] Poor Dad, it's all over him. You can't see his face. Are you cold? I'm going back to dance. Watch Quicky? - I'm going to bed, I'm dead. - No way! - Why? - Rookies don't go to bed before us. [JUSTINE URGES QUICKY] [SIGHS] [EXHALES] [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [BOYS LAUGHING] ADRIEN: Shh! My roommate's sleeping. Come with me. [SIGHS] ADRIEN: Wait. Ketamine. [MACHINE WHIRRING] Let's try it. Move it up. OK. Take the brace. A student for the strut, a cushion for the head. ALL: [SINGING] # Vets, they march ahead # # Their dicks up proud in the air # # Cuz a vet will fuck you anywhere # # They are men, yes sir! With giant balls, for her # # They like a laugh, they like a drink # # They like to screw and we do too! # # Oh yes, they do, and we do too # [GASPS] 71st graduating class St. Expuery School of Veterinary Medicine, September 2015 SC PRESIDENT: Conscripts! You have made it to our great school. We applaud you. Your profs will make you the best vets out there. Your elders will make you family. But first you must learn. Learn to be a team, to obey, to be good rookies. From now on, you will call your elders either "elders" or "great ones". Repeat after me: Elders. - ALL: Elders. - Hey! Elders. ALL: Elders. Good. And great ones. ALL: Great ones. SC PRESIDENT: What a nice bunch this year. Where was I? They'll help you during your rush week, which will end when you hear this: For real? - When you hear. Yeah. - [BLOWS AIR HORN] Then and only then are you no longer rookies. In the meantime, we're counting on you. Make us proud. We'll show you the way. Vets! [SPITS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] ADRIEN: Longest wait ever for an open bar. What is it? - Wait your turn. - Is it meat? - Rabbit kidney. Better not to know. - I'm a vegetarian, I can't eat that. Ask my sister, our family's veggie. - Who's your sister? - Alexia. No shit. - Alex? Alex, come here a sec. - Huh? - You vegetarian? - No. Why? She your sister? Call my parents if you don't trust me. Are you serious? It's nothing. Everybody does it. - So eat hers then. - ALEXIA: I ate mine last year. That's why I'm here now. Go on, eat it. [SIGHS] See? Easy. [SIGHS] Open up. You'll be happy you did it. Don't start the year by chickening out. They're watching. [COUGHS] [RETCHES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Maybe not all animals, but monkeys. It comes from them. Do you think a monkey can get AIDS today? If you treat a monkey in a zoo or African reserve, are you as careful as a doctor doing normal surgery? - No clue. Why are you thinking about this shit? - Take a guy who wants to fuck a monkey. The theory is AIDS started that way. If a guy wants to fuck a monkey today, should he use a condom? I'm eating, man! Don't talk about fucking monkeys. Did wolves raise you? What do I care? Cuz I fuck monkeys or have AIDS? What the fuck. OK, sorry. It was a valid question. They only ate monkeys. The rest was made up. - Who'd be so sick he'd rape an animal? - Lots of people. - Legally, I'm not sure "monkey rape" exists. - Sure it does. Animals have rights. The monkey won't turn anorexic and see a therapist. It's not the same. Monkeys are self-aware. They see themselves, in a mirror, right? - I bet a raped monkey suffers like a woman. - GIRL: So a raped woman, raped monkey, same thing? Yeah. What I'm saying isn't so crazy. Why are we in vet school? Unbelievable. It's easy, really. I expected no less from you. Let's see if your reputation is earned. Oh. One mistake already. Off to a bad start. - May I? - No. Too late. There. [SCRATCHING] [SIGHS] [SIGHS] [YELPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [KNOCK ON DOOR] - ADRIEN: Hey. Are you OK? - Yeah. Stay out. [GASPS, BREATHING HEAVILY] [WINCES] [BLOWS] [SIGHS] [STOMACH GURGLES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Oh, that is bad. Any allergies? - I don't think so. - OK. Will I get it on my face? No, no. It won't last long. It's already peeling. - Any nausea? - Yeah. Since when? - At the same time. - OK. Last period? [WINCES] I'm not sure. A week or two? - OK. Are you on the pill? - No. - [WINCES] - Do you use condoms? I've never... Right. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And this is your rush week? OK. I think it's food poisoning and you're having a reaction. Drink lots of liquids. Water, that is. Avoid solids. Fast a whole day, even. I'll get you a cream. I am hungry though. My stomach always feels empty. Yeah. - What'd they give you? - Raw rabbit kidneys. Someone tells you to eat raw rabbit kidney, and you do? - I said no. - Did they force you? - No. - OK. Keep it. - Use it three times a day. - Thanks. I used to work at the hospital here. One day, they sent a girl your age for blood tests. She was round. - [LIGHTER CLICKS] - Mmm. Fat, actually. A really nice girl, really sweet. Some freak out over needles, but not her. Mmm. She had a ton of tests to do. So it goes well. She gets dressed and bursts into tears. I ask what's wrong and she says I'm the first person to not mention her weight. Why would I? The test was totally unrelated. She said the interns sent her ward to ward, saying they couldn't jab her due to the fat on her arms. They said to lose weight and come back. Can you imagine? Nonsense. I'd had no trouble finding a vein. Why didn't she report it? Why? Don't know. To not bother anyone, I guess. She kind of stood out. She probably wanted to be average. How do you see yourself? - Average. - [SCOFFS] Find yourself a quiet corner. Wait it out. The year always starts out rough. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Eyes to the floor for an elder, rookie! - You wearing that? You didn't hear today? - Hear what? The dress code is night club. Go change. Girls wear something hot. Not t-shirts with sequins. This is all I have. - Is that a no? - I'll have to look. OK. Uniform then. [PROFESSOR TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Yes? Come in. Hurry up. Here you have the septate uterus, characterized by its long horns and gradual narrowing toward the fallopian tubes. Too small. No way you're having that. If you'd spoken up, I wouldn't have had to eat it. Let it go! It was that or you were a reject. It's your life! I shouldn't have helped. You didn't! [SIGHS] I'm being nice. You'll stretch them with your big feet. Come here! I'm not your slave! - Your handwriting is awful. - What? Do you write on the washer? Hands off! I just fixed a couple things. Small errors, mostly. Take what you need and scram. - Move. - Can I try it on? Quick. [EXHALES] It's not me. OK, get out. - Like this? - Yeah. You piss me off. See you. [SIGHS] [STRAINING] Fuck this! - [SIGHS] - [SHOES CLATTERING] Could you help me with... - ADRIEN: Don't stop. So good. - [ADRIEN SIGHING DEEPLY] [ADRIEN MOANING] - That's pork. - So? Grab some ketchup. - What's in your pocket? - Sorry? - Your lab coat. There. Show me. - Problem solved. I need to see to ring it up. [CASH REGISTER BEEPS] Stealing a burger's fucked up, even for me. You need cash? Did anyone see? Nah. Own it. Why that? [SNAPS FINGERS] Don't know. - I'm starving. It'll be awesome. - It's stupid. It's a first, we need to celebrate. - It's on me. - [CHUCKLES] Great. ADRIEN: What's your sister's problem? - JUSTINE: What problem? - ADRIEN: Let's sit over there. I don't know, she's not exactly friendly. JUSTINE: What do you know? You barely talk to her. ADRIEN: Neither have you, since you arrived. I can't if you watch. Say that you kill a guy's hard-on for life. It's so bullshit to sell booze at rest stops. Check the bigwigs. Big rigs, you mean. Wig's different. Big wigs are like VIPs or something. OK. Even with an hour's sleep, you're still drunk. Do you think they swap blood or inject water, like cyclists? Ask him yourself. MAN: Where you kids off to? Just having some shawarma. Then back to campus. You're at the vet school? I came down there once with my pig, he had the flu. Flu's bad for pigs. But he's better now. - You have a pig in your truck? - Yeah. We all do. To swap our boozer blood. Pigs are almost like humans. Have you learned that yet? Genetically, or something. Well kiddos, enjoy your meal. Little lady's hungry. Don't they feed you down there? School's good. You're lucky. You're up? For breakfast. - Putting on a barbecue? - [CHUCKLES] What do you eat? Cereal. - Cereal's up there. - I'm just getting milk, OK? [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] [GRUNTS] - PROFESSOR: So you cheated. - No. - You admit your friend did. - No. Miss, I don't have a soft spot for top students, unlike all my colleagues, I feel more sympathy for your friend than you. School is tough for him. He has to fight to stay. But you, the wonder child, you ride in and depress my students. Some would sooner drop out than compare themselves to you. You aren't needed here. Worse, you scare away excellent doctors. As you can guess, I'd rather see your ranking drop than your friend's. It was him. [RETCHING] [GAGGING] [COUGHING] [COUGHS] [GAGGING, COUGHING] [GASPING] [COUGHING] [SPITS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [COUGHS] Two fingers will make it come up faster. [DOOR CLOSES] [COW MOOS] Alex! - Hey! - [COWS MOOING] Alex! Alex! Can we talk? - Can't hear you! - We have to talk. Afterwards! [COWS CONTINUE MOOING] - One time I made out with a one-armed guy. - No way. Yeah. [LAUGHING] It took me two hours to notice. You know, he draped a blazer over his shoulder. I thought, OK, country club, must have money. But no, he just had one arm. [LAUGHS] - Alex? - Mmm? Do you think I'm weird? What? No! Why? You know you're the favorite. I'm the weirdo in the family. Always have been. [JUSTINE LAUGHS] What are you doing? What the fuck? Hips pushed out, see. And go! No hands. - How do you do that? - Go on, let's see how far you shoot. Push hard to get a strong stream and it works. - I'll go all over myself. - [BOTH LAUGHING] Deep breath... Fuck! I'm pissing on myself! Normal squat! Normal squat! I'm still peeing. [BOTH LAUGHING] Damn! So gross. Let's go, it's raining. Can I sleep over? I don't feel well. You never feel well, ever. What? What's wrong? Stay still. Better? Looks the same to me. - At your age, I already gave myself Brazilians. - What's that? - [WINCES] It's scorching. Will it hurt a lot? - Beauty is pain. - [SCREAMS] - [EXCLAIMS] - [GROANS] - I'm amazing. - No, I can't. - And leave it like that? - It's uneven. - No, this is torture. Great, now it's worse. Let me do the other side at least. Tell me when you're... Ow! [LAUGHS] - No! No! - Come on. We all do it. [WINCES] - [YELPS] - Shit. What? Tell me. - Odd. It's stuck. - It's stuck? - I don't know. - What's Plan B? This is weird. Wait. Get away! - No, no, you'll circumcise me! - We have to. You're shaking. It's my pussy! What? What? What is it? [BREATHING SHAKILY] Alex! Alex! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! My sister cut her finger. With scissors. Cutting something, who cares! 15 minutes? Ice? OK, I know. OK. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [EXHALES] [LAUGHING SOFTLY] - Anyone seen you for the prosthesis? - What? - Didn't they sew it back on? - ALEXIA: Nope. Quicky ate my finger. FATHER: The doctor will be by soon. MOTHER: What about her rehab? How does it work? No nerve damage, no rehab. There's no point. You're leaving her like this? Really? She can't eat! - I'm not disabled. - Yes, you are! - ALEXIA: You'd like that! - MOTHER: Don't say that. Shit, leave her alone! Don't talk to your mother that way. What's wrong? - I'm going to piss. - Me too. What the hell? OW. - [WHEELCHAIR THUDS] - ALEXIA: Ouch! [PANTING] [GAGS, COUGHS] [COUGHS] [COUGHING] Apologize to your mother. I'm not going back in there. - Do you smoke? - Yeah. - Who has Quicky? - [LAUGHS] He'll be put down, if not already. Why? He didn't attack her. That's cruel! They have to. An animal that has tasted human flesh isn't safe. If he likes it, he'll bite again. Can't he just take a pill? Medicine's not an exact science. You'll see. [SIGHS] Don't have two girls, honey. It's too hard. ALEXIA: Mom and Dad still here? JUSTINE: No. - JUSTINE: Where are you going? - ALEXIA: We... we need to talk. Here's good. - You wanted to talk? - What about? - You asked. - Something to say? - No, you brought me out here. - So? I've nothing to say. Stop mind fucking me then! You're like Mom! You sound like Mom. If we're here for deer, I'll kill you. - You're so aggressive. - JUSTINE: No, I'm not. Anger management issues! - I'm not angry! - Stay here! Alex! - [TIRES SQUEALING] - [CAR CRASHES] [HORN BLARING CONTINUOUSLY] Alex? - Are you OK? - [GROANS] [HORN CONTINUES BLARING] What's wrong with you? Nice, yell at me now. Shit. [EXHALES SHARPLY] Don't! What are you doing? Stop. Why are you opening the door? [PANTING] He won't make it. Spit it out! I said, spit! Fuck! Are you kidding? I did this for you, idiot! You need to learn, right? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [CAR HORN BLARES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] What did I miss? Do me up. Done? It's the gloves. - Take them off. - PROFESSOR: Remove the sheet. We're starting. Geez. What a pain. You may begin. You have an hour. - Sorry for your sis. - No shit. I thought you hated her. - It's still fucked. - It's just a finger. PROFESSOR: Very nice. Look, get right in there. Dive in, don't be afraid. Tell her. She'll like that.

They party on call and barf if someone comes in. They treat the guy, then go back. Luckily, you had nothing to sew back on. It'd be on backwards. - I'm so lucky. - ADRIEN: Later. Wanna beat me? Hands off. I thought he was gay. You want to play? Yeah. Did you lose weight? My dress fits you better. It's less slutty. Thank you. It's not a compliment. You better not be anorexic. It's gross.

We took her everywhere. Our friends loved her. She was full tilt from the start. She should have studied politics or something. [CHUCKLES] So, I guess she got used to being... herself. It's our fault. We didn't find a solution. What do you mean? Your mom was tough at first. Kept saying I was her best friend at school. It drove me nuts. It's not like she had a boyfriend. Just me. And then we had our first kiss. And I understood. [GASPS, SNIFFLES] I'm sure you'll find a solution, honey.
