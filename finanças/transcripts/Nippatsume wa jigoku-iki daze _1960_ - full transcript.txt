Hey, bartender, where are you? - I'm here... - Oh, there you are. Hey, pour me a drink! - The best Scotch you got. - Yes, sir. Hey, what are you yammering about? Tsunokichi, the raging bull, never walked away from a fight! It's all your fault, you know? Just because I look like a third class passenger, you won't let me drink in the first class bar. - That's the rules. - Well, I don't like them! So, you think I don't belong here, huh? - Too bad! - Make way. He's dangerous. Don't go inside. We've wired the mainland. We'll arrest him as soon as we land. So, let him drink for now. When he gets drunk, we'll restrain him. You idiots! I'm not falling for that trick. You bastards! Oh, it's you. Come, have a drink. - Hey, Brother Tsuno. - Here. You're really an ugly drunk. If you have that around, they'll arrest you. Stop it! There's no police on the high seas. Having a drink with an audience like this... I feel like I'm a movie star. You know why we're traveling. Of course I do. I want to go home real bad. We've nowhere to run on a ship. So, don't get out of hand. I thought that's what you'd say. You really act like an intellectual. In our business, you know, sometimes we have to let off steam, or it's not worth living. So, you won't listen to me? Nope! What are you gonna do about it? All right, I wash my hands off you. Hope the cops get you and throw you in jail! You moron! Go drink some milk, you greenhorn! You know that man? - No, I don't. - But... I know. If he gets more violent, I'll restrain him. Hey, give me more booze! Huh? No one's here? Useless ninnies. Quiet! Who the hell are you? How'd you get in here? Through the door. Pour me one. What the...?! Ouch, ouch... What an unfriendly bartender... Who do you think I am? Nothing much, I'm sure. What did you say?! Who are you? I'm an assassin like you, but way smarter. You asked for it! Hey. - Looking for this? - Oh! Damn, you can't treat me like a fool! Don't get so mad. Here you go. What the...? Damn you! You're stupid, after all. If I returned that weapon to you as is, I'd be dead by now. Hey, pour me another. If you do it well, I'll give you back the bullets as a tip. - Huh? - Dear! Hey, I'm ready. You go for it! Sure thing! Wait a second. Pour me some. Do you know that person? - He's my lover. - Huh?! L-o-v-e-r. Aren't we a pair? - You're an animal. - What? That's why you have the strength of an animal. You bastard! You asked for it! Well, give up? Go ahead, kill me! I see, you're gutsy! Unfortunately, I don't kill unless it's a job. - Here you go, dear! - Thanks. You're really thoughtful, Maki. Move! - Serves you right! - You got caught, fool. Don't stop me! Ken, help me! - But I'm just a greenhorn... - You! You're his buddy? What are you going to do? It's his fault, he deserves it. Then, you have no objections? Very well! You're not throwing him overboard, are you? You bastards! - What are you doing? - Please, stop. You freakin' bastards, let me go. Help me! Help! Help! - He's calling for help... - Don't worry. I'm just sobering him up. Don't anyone dare touch this. Someone, help me! - All settled? - Yep. You're not worried? Being his buddy, and all... I hate yakuza. The less, the better. Don't make me laugh! What about you, then? Same thing. Better if I'm gone soon. And yakuza like you, too. You say funny things. - Wanna drink with me? - Nope, not with you. - Pour me some! - Yes, sir! A Northern Town Brother! Come here! All right, I'm going to have to get serious. Brother, don't do that. Huh? You promised. Just because you saved my life... But, sometimes, I'll help you. One down! Two down! Go to exercise, once in a while! Okay! Demons, go away! Leave! Get out! Ken, you're pretty good. I don't fight amateurs. Hey, Proprietor. Bring more sak√©. Yes, sir! What? Hey, be careful! You knocked the chimney off! You still want more? Huh, what...? Oh, we meet again. What are you doing here? I was passing by, and guys were sleeping out in the cold. I brought them in, so they won't catch a cold. Oh, they're still sleeping! They're not asleep, they're passed out. - So, you did this? - Goes without saying. No one else is stronger than me. Don't you dare interfere. - Did I interfere? - Sure you did! Okay, so I'll take them back out. But I'm amazed you could do all this. What are you saying? The whiskey was bad the last time. I won't lose to you now. Never mind. Hey, close the door. Yes, sir. You're lucky you didn't die on that ship. I caught a cold because of you. He saved me. - A bond between men is strong. - I thought so. You're lucky the cops didn't get you when you docked. I dove into the sea before the ship landed. Cops are stupid. I bet they're still searching the ocean floor. You're right, Japanese cops are always caught napping. They're a waste of taxpayer money. Although, I've never paid taxes myself. Hey, young'un, I'm paying tonight. What? You refuse to drink with a yakuza? Good timing. I should thank you. But I won't drink this swill. This is the real thing. It's great when it's cold. - Here. - Okay. I like you, Brother. - By the way, I'm... - Tsunokichi, the raging bull, right? Huh? And that's Ken, the Kid. How do you know our names? In Hokkaido, your names resound like thunder. I didn't know I was that well known. But you were not up to your reputation that time. The conditions were bad on the ship! But you haven't said who you were. It's not worth mentioning. No way, I know you must be famous. So, let us hear it. Oh, yeah? I think I have a business card. Three priors. Convicted of murder, and escapee from Abashiri prison. I underestimated you! Name's Kumaji, the bear. Nice to meet you. You guys sure are strong. Who are you? People around here know me as Tokuzo of Yuuki. You were with those goons? I wouldn't have stood by if they were with me. They are Kawakatsu family members. Our two families vie for power here. The less of them, the better for me. How about it? Why don't you stay with us for a while? Just hang around. That's all. That's interesting. What do you say? Well, I'm not too crazy about this guy as a Boss. What? I found you! Here you are! Why did you give me the slip when the ship docked? Just go home, will you? Get out of the way. I'll follow you anywhere you go. You're my lover, after all. Huh? So, this kid is your woman? - You make quite a pair. - Hey, you drunk, I'll tie you up again. Hey, Brother, she's just a child. What's with this? Are you stupid? I told you, I'm his woman. She's the child of a man I killed long ago. Then, you are her enemy! But, with no family, she decided to follow me. That's scary. But you're a strange one. There're a million women in this world. You didn't have to do it with this kid. Don't be a fool. I haven't done... - Hey, you drunk! - Huh? Our love is platonic. What's so funny? I'm making do with him, but when I find the perfect guy, I'm going to switch. Not sentimental, huh? Unfortunately, I haven't found anyone better. The young men these days are like dirt. It's hard being a young woman. I guess if she's that committed, you've got to take care of her. Right you are! Aren't you hungry? What do you want? You know me so well. It makes me happy. - I want a chicken and egg rice bowl. - Hey! Yes, one chicken and egg coming up. Don't sneak out while I'm eating. I can't promise you that... If you do, I'll tell everyone all about you. - Hey, hey! - Don't do that. We all walk a crooked path. Lots of dirt hidden in this bootie. Brother, you mean body, don't you? - Bootie. - Body! Yes, what he says. So, don't do anything underhanded. What's your name? Maki. Isn't it a classy name? Are you the guys? I've come to avenge my men. Here he is. I was waiting for this. Come and get me! You bastard, prepare yourself! Wait, Boss! Leave this to me. I'll send these three drifters to hell. Oh, yeah, you're a lively one. Hey, I don't know which rock you crawled out from, but you shouldn't have sullied my turf. I'll repay you in spades! This sure is getting interesting! It was just a test. You're pretty good. I can't let you go scot free, though. That's your problem. I don't like to stay in one place too long. I'll settle this now! - Hey! - Yes! Hold on a second. Stop. Mr. Yuuki... Why are you here? I know all about it. You both have your reasons, but if you keep shooting each other, the cops will come snooping around. If people get hurt, my men would want blood. In any case, why don't we take this elsewhere? That's a good idea. And where would that be? You're too hasty. The only place around here is Zannen River. All right! I'll expect all of you to show. Or else...! Are you kidding me? We won't run or hide. All three of us will be waiting. Wait a second, Brother. It won't take three of us to take care of him. I'll go alone! - How dare you?! - What? Simmer down... Hey, Kawakatsu. It's not like this is a long standing feud. Why don't you talk this out? How about one from each side go to Zannen River and settle this? That way, you'll avoid unnecessary injuries. I'll be the witness. All right. I'll leave it in your hands. Okay, so it's all settled. Shall we say nine o'clock? Let me know who's going? - I'll go! - Boss! They're drifters. Who knows what they'll do. What are you saying? I've killed some men in my time. - I'll go! - No, wait right there. - This is my... - Don't, Brother. I'll take care of the yakuza. No consensus at all. Make up your mind. Let's do this. I'll put one bullet in my gun. We'll pass it around, and the one that fires will go. He really is smart! - So, here it goes. - All right. It's a six shooter. Who goes first? Me, of course! - What's the target? - Whatever you want. Okay! I've never been lucky. So, it's mine. So, my lover wins. I'm next. Wait a second. Did you really load that gun? Proof is in the pudding. No doubts there. So, you win. Now that it's settled, let's not stand around. Why don't you leave, Kawakatsu? Don't break your promise! Okay, let's start over. Boy, I'm starving! I'll go get ready. You know where you're going? Sure, Zannen River. I lost my chance and now it's freezing. - Proprietor. - Yes? - Bring me more sak√©. - Beer for me. Oh, no. Hey, proprietor! - Yes? - Where's the bathroom? We ask people to go outside. I'll get even colder... I'm busy right now. You're back. I have a favor to ask from you. What is it? What? We decided it was Brother Kuma's job. Come on, don't shout. To tell you the truth, I don't like Kuma. I have a feeling he's going to botch it. But you seem to be very dependable. I hear you're better than him. That's true. But to take someone's job is against our code of honor. Only this much? You're asking me to take someone's job. All right, then... The opponent's not a greenhorn, you know? He's a Boss, isn't he? I guess this is the going price. He's taking a long time! Hey, Brother, it's time. Oh, you're right! Can you handle this? If I die, he'll take care of you. He's the intellectual type, but kind of nice. All right, I'm going, Mr. Intellectual. Hey, Brother, do it good! Where shall we meet? How about the station? That's safe. - I should be there by midnight. - All right. We'll take the freight train around then. A regular train would be dangerous. Why do you keep worrying about danger? I'm going to talk this out. That's not what they think. You're good enough to kill him with a single shot. Then, his men will no doubt come after us. - So, be sure to be careful. - All right. Father! Father! How unfair of you! The witness isn't even here yet! Wait a second. He was already dead when I arrived. - Damn you! - Hey, don't! - I didn't do it. - Shizue! You bastard, how dare you kill my Boss? It wasn't me! Then, who did it? You've got it all wrong. I was too late... It's my fault. If I had come a little sooner... But this isn't done like this. He should have waited. He's very sneaky! Miss, I'll chase him. No matter where he goes, I'll get him. Wait, Ryu! I'll go with you. - What's the matter? - Huh? - Can't you sleep? - No... I slept well. It's already morning. Is it? - Good morning. - 'Morning. Oh, where is this train headed? It's headed for Tokyo. Tokyo? That brings back memories. I'd never guessed you're from Tokyo. Yup, I'm an Edoite from Kanda. - Right, my dear? - Yes, yes. So, you met Kuma in Tokyo? And followed him all the way to Hokkaido. You really must love him. Well then, now that it's morning, we have to change to a different train. - That's right. - Let's do it, this train stinks. Hey, which trains are you taking? - From Kitakane to Tokyo. - Oh, really? Hey, you! Don't take up all the seat. Go away! Here, Brother! Excuse me. Oh, goody. Here you go, Brother. Where are you going? Huh? Well, since we've gotten so close, I'll follow you. No way! I already have a follower. I don't have enough to take care of all of you. Don't worry about money. You have money, huh? I have enough, so we all can have a good time. That's not possible! You don't have to worry. Once we get to Tokyo, - I have some friends. - You're eating my lunch! You good for nothings! - I'll pay you, okay? - All right... As I said, I can earn it by gambling. I see now. So, you gamble? All right, let's go to a hot spring, then. That's right, a hot spring near a ski resort. Mister, can you ski? Did you have to ask that? I know all about skiing. Tokyo Tsuno's taking his time. What's he doing? Where did he go? We got a lot of things. What if Brother Tsuno doesn't show? I should have gone to the joint with him. If he doesn't show, we'll take these and run. Don't be ridiculous. This is Tokyo. The Police HQ is nearby. So, it's not good? I think they don't have money. How's this? Too simple? You look good! - Ignorance is bliss. - Which hat do you like? You don't look good in either. Is this the police? Come at once! - As soon as possible! - Hey! - Sorry I'm late. - How did it go? Very good! Hey, where's my gear? Bring the best that you've got. - Yes, yes. - Hurry up, hurry up! A fight? Huh, what happened? Which man is it? Where are they? I hope that's not funny money. What? Are you doubting me now? Oh, by the way, you need a hat. That looks great on you! This one! - Excuse me. - How much? Thank you for your purchase. It comes to 63.500 yen. - 63.500 yen, I see. - Yes. Take the customer's money. So, it's you? We'll put your old clothes in backpacks. Oh, I'll take that. Oh, is he an epileptic? What? Epilepsy? Put a slipper on his head. What a weakling! Hey, Brother, let's go. - Let's go up together. - Wait a second. What is it? You've got to do this right. Stretch first. What do we do? - Let's go. - Okay? Okay! - You're good at this. - What? Hey! Hey! Honey! Oh goodness. - Help! - Help us! Come lend a hand. They got into trouble! Brother! Help me get up... Are you all right? - Are you all right? - Brother! You give a good massage. You saved my life earlier. This is nothing compared to it. Don't take it too seriously. No, I have to. If you didn't help us, we'd be frozen by now. I know I have a lot to repay. To be honest, don't you feel the need for a man? Just because I'm alone, don't underestimate me. That hurt... You've got it all wrong. What do you mean? A pretty woman like you all alone... Who knows what may happen to you? So, I thought I'd protect you with my strong fists. You mean, a bodyguard? Bodyguard? That doesn't sound good! Why do you think I would hire a yakuza like you as my bodyguard? I know my own kind. - What do you mean? - You see... I know you're no ordinary woman. What did you say? I'm kidding! Oh good, you're going to hire me? Thank you so much. - Who are you? - Huh? I'm Kuma... Don't lie. Who do you think I am? Could it be that you're a police woman? Where did I go wrong? You may think what you want. If you think I'm alone... Miss Ujiie. Who is this man? Oh, I didn't know you had a patron. Sorry for the intrusion! I finally have a date. Thanks for your hard work. We have to go back to Kyushu right now. Another New Year... I'd like to go home. It's been more than a year. The deal was for one year. No one can stop me if I want to go home. I don't want to go home. I want a regular job somewhere. That'd be good enough. That's not possible. We're too set in yakuza ways. Besides, Junko's waiting for you. Don't talk about her. She shouldn't get involved with a yakuza like me. You love her. Young people always talk like that. If you're going home, I'd like to take Kuma. Is that so? You don't believe me? He's good people! He's strong and gutsy. And he's also very straight forward. It's too bad that he doesn't have a job. I want to find him a job. No, you're only contributing to organized crime. Don't be so difficult! A bond between men is priceless. A Southern Town It's about Junko... Make up your mind. I shouldn't brag about my sister, but she's a good person. I know that. Junko likes you. But it's hard for a girl to say that first. I've made up my mind. I want to marry her. But... - You have a request? - I have. Then, you must tell me. It's hard to say, though. But it's time I should tell you. Of course. The condition is... Out with it! I will. In order to marry Junko, please fire me. You want to go straight? - I do. - Why? Do you want Junko to be a yakuza's wife? It's not what I want or not. If I like the man Junko loves, I want to see them married. That's all. I don't know what love is. I just want my sister to be happy. That's all. - You don't love your sister. - You fool! - Are you leaving? - Yes. Let me be clear. I want to marry Junko. So, I will go straight. Ken! What were you two fighting about? It wasn't a fight. I asked Boss's permission to marry you. And Brother refused? Yes, to let me go straight... I don't want to marry you until I'm legit. I'm happy, I'll wait for you until you are. Are you sure? How do you like that? It's your turn. You missed! Might look that way to an amateur. All the fingers are shot. But, Kuma, why did you aim for the fingers? That's how you deal with assassins. An assassin can't function if he doesn't have fingers. If I wanted to kill him, I'd do it the regular way. - Another. - All right. See? All the bullets went through the first hole. I underestimated you. I'd like you to teach my men how to shoot. Sure, but I'm getting lax with nothing to do. A bodyguard is a boring job. I think your turn will come for sure. I sure hope so. Welcome! - This kid... - Don't call me kid! - What would you like? - Let's see... Welcome! Welcome! Welcome, you two! Highball or Gin Fizz, you name it and I'll make it! Manhattans, metropolitans, Paris, Rome and Moscow! Even a taste of Tokyo! We have everything here. What will you have? Brother, did you get that? - How about that? - Huh? It's Sakurai and his band's first gig here. Isn't he good? Tokyo artists are a cut above the rest. Yeah, he's a lively one. But he's not known in Tokyo. You know your artists. Then, I'll have to tell you the truth. The fact is, he was in prison for a while. He was just released. Really? An artist with a prior conviction, huh? He was a drug dealer. And a high class one at that. Can't tell he's just out of prison, can you? Hey, one more. Kuma, you're not drinking? How about this? This is really good. It's the real thing. It has the tax office's seal right here. That's quality stuff. You know, Kuma. That makes me so happy. I'll tell you another thing... The label's real, but not the booze. I see. No wonder they call you blabber mouth. I can't drink when it's this noisy. I completely agree with you. I've been keeping it a secret, but I found a old fashion Japanese bar. - Really? - Yes. Shut up! You're not the only customers here. Don't act like you own the place. You're just jealous 'cause I'm popular! What did you say? Let's go outside! You bastards! Who are you?! A cut above you guys. Get out of here. What? How dare you, bastard?! Great. This will make the sak√© taste better. Welcome. Sorry for the ruckus. My friend's cleaning up the mess. Come on, go ahead. Pay the bill, both of you. Hurry up, do it. Now, get out of here! Hey, you forgot this! Hey... See? Didn't I tell you? Isn't she a looker, huh? I agree. Hey. - Are you surprised? - I am. Why are you here? I followed you. What? You know each other? - Have one. - Thank you. I'm sorry... Why are you shaking? Well, he may be a bit more good looking. - But I'm not that bad, either. - Hey... You've been coming here not knowing who she is? Yup. This is Boss Kawakatsu's daughter. Huh? She thinks I killed her father. No, Brother didn't do it! Then, who did? That I don't know, but you'd never do anything underhanded. Thanks. You're the only one who believes me. But she's not going to take your word for it. Let's not talk about that tonight. I just got tired of the yakuza world. At first, I wanted to catch you and take you to the police. As soon as I left, my people all abandoned me, though. They went over to Boss Yuuki, and the family scattered. Yakuza talk of honor and obligation, but, in the end, they go with what's beneficial for them. I wasn't aware of that... Maybe Boss Yuuki... planned to disband your family from the start? That could be. I remember him as being a shifty guy. That's right. - I want a glass. - Okay. But there was a real feisty guy with you. Oh, you mean Ryuzo? I have no idea where he is now. I thought he had made a promise to you. Wasn't he in love with you? I doubt it. Yakuza nowadays have no backbone. You'll get a hangover if you drink so fast. I won't! Somehow, I feel like I've been dumped, I can't help but drink. You're an idiot. It's not like she and I were lovers. Maybe I'll fall in love with you. What? If you're really not my father's killer. Shizu. I'll come here every night. Thank you. It's not because I've fallen for you, though. But in the hopes that you'll understand the truth. - The bill. - All right. Hey, Tsuno, you're so drunk. You should stop now. - Come on, let's go. - We're already leaving? Yes. I can't even have a drink in peace. - Come on, let's go home. - All right... - Are you all right? - I sure am. Thank you for coming. Ryu, where are you going? We got lucky. One of them is drunk. This is our chance. - Wait! - For what? They're local yakuza, so I couldn't get near them. We'll never get a second chance. Ryu! I have a feeling that man didn't kill my father. What did you say? His eyes are not those of a killer. Ryu! I was waiting for you. I knew you were there. I also knew you'd come for me. Draw, we'll duel it out. - I refuse. - What?! If you insist, I will... Don't get flustered, young'un. Very well. If you really think I did it, just go ahead and shoot. I will! I said to not hesitate. If you're confident, shoot. I have the confidence I didn't kill Boss Kawakatsu. So, I'm not afraid of your bullets. Now... Is it better like this? You did it?! I'm gonna kill everyone who's after you, Brother. I must be very fond of you. You! You shot Ryu! No, it wasn't me! So, I have to think of you as a killer, after all. No, no, wait a minute... Where did he go? Drats. I'll explain later. Don't be surprised. It's Ken, isn't it? What? You don't have to pretend. He's meeting with the Boss. He should be out soon. Who are you? Well, I'm someone interested in Ken as much as you. I'm a tragic heroine. Good night. Even if that's part of the deal, it's too dangerous for you to go alone. I know that. But this business can make or break this family. It's a big chance for us. Just because Wan is a nervous guy, I don't want to walk away from this deal. I agree with Kuma. I insist on going with you. I said it's not your run of the mill deal. I've been in secret negotiations for six months. We've been handling drugs since the last Boss, but this goes way beyond just handling it. If I succeed, our Manji group can monopolize... - The drug route in west Japan. - I see. That's big. Our last Boss was killed by someone unknown. Both Tsuno and I were protecting him, but he got killed anyway. Really? This is the first time I hear of this. I didn't know. It's a secret. That's why Ken and I had to go on a trip. But why did you two have to go, since you didn't do it? The police were relentless. Since a Boss was killed, they'd be thorough. So, we pretended he went alone. Really? That's a strange thing! Yes, it sure is. Enough. Let's not talk about that. I appreciate that you're worried about me. I'll talk to them, so I can take one person. Great! - My turn has finally come! - What are you saying? - I'm going. - All right. - Let's use this. - No, thanks. You always have the advantage, Kuma. Wait, wait. I'll be the one choosing. No objections, right? All right. Ken, you'll come with me? I want you to learn the business. I'm reporting a crime. Please, chase that car. They're going to a drug deal. I'm not lying. Please, go after them. In that car, there is my brother, and... Someone special to you? His name is Ken. My brother doesn't know, but if Ken was chosen to go to the drug deal, I was to tell the police immediately. I see. Can't you go any faster? We'll lose them this way. Don't worry. I know where they're headed. - Huh? - Approximately. HQ to Car Four. HQ to Car Four. Yes, this is Car Four. Go ahead. There's a fight in progress in sector 18. Please, proceed immediately. Proceed immediately. Understood. Why didn't you tell them you were after the drug dealers? Butt out! We have our reasons! The money's all here. The merchandise? - It's all good. - Fine, take it. Come in. - Professor... - Yes? You have a good young man in your group. I'm pleasantly surprised. Thanks, but he's just starting. I want him to learn to represent me, so I have him accompany me. You've selected a good successor, Mr. Shino. So, now there's another Japanese I can't trust. What? - What did you say? - Don't act innocent! You must know, for sure. What is it? I'm talking about him, your sucessor! You tried to stop us. You must think the cops are taking their time. Shall I tell you why they're late? Hey! Junko! Someone in your group tried to do me in, but this man saved me. I'm alive to fight another day. Ken, what's going on here? Mr. Shino. We never trusted your group from the start. And we were right. When I have an important transaction, I steal a police car, and have it nearby. It's very safe that way. My caution paid off tonight. Your sister colluded with this man, and tried to inform the police about the deal. - What are you gonna do, Mr. Shino? - I am the betrayed one. Exactly. But you bear some of the responsibility, too. Wait a second! I'll take care of this. I promise. Then, I'll tell you. You stand to gain or lose a lot of money. If you want to keep dealing with me... I'll do anything! But please save my sister! All right. This room is soundproof. I'll kill the traitor. Brother! Don't move! If you do, I'll take out your Boss. Throw down your guns! - What do you intend to do? - I'm at an advantage now. If you don't want to die, make sure we get out safely. Start walking! Junko! Brother, come with us. Boss. As promised, I'm going straight. Wait ten minutes. Otherwise, your Boss is a dead man. Don't shoot! Throw down your gun! Junko, hurry up and go! Junko! Boss! - What's going on? - Good timing! Ken betrayed me and ran off with Junko. I was worried something like that might happen. And now, what do you intend to do? I'll think about what to do with Junko. Go find them and bring them back. And if they resist? - It can't be helped. - So, I can handle it? What are you going to do? But bring Junko back unharmed. I know. I wouldn't point a gun at her. - See you. - I'll go with you. - I have something else for you to do. - What is it? If Kuma fails, you finish the job. Kuma's a drifter. If you need to, kill both Ken and Kuma. Huh? That is one big job... I trust you completely. But I do like Brother Kuma, you know? Shut up! Go away! Hold on. Come with me. - What do you want? - You know. - It's the Boss's order. - I see. Where are you taking him? I can't tell you, Miss. At any rate, please wait here. I won't. You're going to kill him. - Too bad... - Junko. I can't run from him. I knew we'd clash one day. - Ken! - I have to try. It's not definite that I'll lose. Good for you. Now, I can kill you without guilt. Hey, shall we go? All right. How about this place? - It's a good place to die. - All right. Do you have any last words? You're a rough one. Keep it as a souvenir. I didn't know you were good with a knife. Brother Tsuno taught me. He's a pro with the knife. - Are you ready? - Any time. Ken! Hey, Tsunokichi! I knew you were following me. You're sharp, Brother. But you shouldn't have killed Junko. Couldn't be helped. It just happened. Hey, if you're going to kill me, shoot me now! Wait, Brother! Come with me. Something always happens during drug deals. Shut up. Brother, I never told this to anyone... - But that drug deal a year ago? - I don't want to hear it. Can you listen to me, please? That night, it was pouring a lot... Are we square on the money and the merchandise? Thank you. Be careful going back. All right, shall we go now? Yes. What's wrong, Brother? Oh, Boss! Damn it, they were waiting for him. What happened here? I don't know who it was. He disappeared into the night. It must be someone who had a grudge. Boss Narukaze, you mustn't get involved. Leave here immediately. Open up! Brother! Why are you here so late? - The Boss was killed. - Huh? Come in. This is terrible. In any case, you two have to leave for a while. Okay? When the cops come, they'll investigate the whole Manji group. If you two are hanging around, you'll be the suspects. Not only that, if they find out you were dealing drugs, they'll be hell to pay. But... Let's say he went out alone. I'll handle the rest. I'll leave it in your hands. Go away for a year. When the heat is off, come back. Go now, if there isn't anything else. - Hey, Ken. - Yes? Say goodbye to Junko. Yes. I'll wait... a year, two years... But I'll be waiting for a straight man, not a yakuza. I know. Use this for starters. Take it. And what about my expenses? Go as far away as you can. Don't contact me. I won't be even able to attend the Boss's funeral... That's it. Now that I've told you, it's a load off my mind. What an awful story. I feel sick to my stomach. - Sorry about that. - It's freezing. Who is it? It's me. Sakurai, is that you? No, wait a bit longer. - We have to wait for the right moment. - I know that. You should lock the door. No one but you would visit this time of the night. - How is Professor Wan? - He's angry. It's going to take a lot to make him feel good. Then, I guess I'll be leaving. Oh, was there something? Sure. My photographer friend brought me this. It's a present. He's a big wig. I knew he was no ordinary yakuza. - How much? - I'm short of cash. - Name your price. - A hundred thousand. Too cheap? No problem! Consider yourself paid. I don't need a receipt. Hey! Brother, drink up. Oh, you're back. Oh, Boss. I'm sorry. Why didn't you come straight to me? I wanted to, but I needed a drink first. All right, come this way. - What about Junko and Ken? - That's the thing. - I really feel bad. - What did you say? I told you not to let them get away. I did what I was told. See... This was Ken's. But I didn't get anything from your sister's body. - What?! - I'm sorry! It happened so fast... It was instinct... My finger moved by itself. You damn fool! Who told you to kill Junko, too? Hey, Tsunokichi, how could you let him do that? Well... let's see... I'm good at killing people, but not saving them. All right. Then, kill Kuma now. - What? - It's an order, do it! Yes, sir. It can't be helped. You're so serious, both of you. Don't mind him, shoot him! Oh, you don't have to get mad. And don't be too hasty. All's good if Junko's alive, right? What?! Hey, come on out! Junko! Too bad I'm still alive. You look shocked, Boss. Hey, Ken, tell him what's going on. Kuma did shoot me as instructed. But they were blanks. - Kuma, you...! - Hey, don't move. You're hard to please. If I kill, you get angry, and if I let her live, you algo get angry. Kuma! You're going against me? I never trusted you from the start. Hey, Tsuno. Are you really going to shoot me? Even if you say you will, maybe you won't. Because you're a liar. - What are you talking about? - Am I not right? Then, shall I tell you the truth? About the incident a year ago? Some unknown person shot your former Boss on his way back from a drug deal. Hey, isn't that what you said? Well, that was a lie. The shooter was... You! You shot him from behind! Wait. I just did what I was told! I know that! The one who gave you the orders... was you, Boss. You had your own Boss killed, and made Tsuno and Ken take a trip out of town, while you took your Boss's place. You thought you got away with it, but Ken suspected the truth, and wanted to go straight. That's what lead to tonight's incident. Am I wrong? That's good thinking for a guy like you. You think I'll confess? Well, you're wrong. Look! Mr. Shino, there's too many rats in your organization. I came to help you exterminate them all. You said your name was Kumaji, right? I see, it's you, no mistake. My secretary went to great lengths to get this photo. Kumaji, your real name... is Takeo Danbara, Police Detective. - Mr. Danbara! - You got me. If you know that much, the game's up. It can't be helped now. Indeed I am Detective Danbara. Ever since your Boss was killed, and two of his men were sent away, I've been conducting an undercover investigation. It was a long road, but now I have the killer. I also have the details of the new drug route. I must thank you all, gentlemen. I must give credit to police training. They teach you to surrender with grace. Maybe you're an expert shooter, but how will you dodge all these guns? Junko, give Ken up. Listen, I'll shoot first. - Then, everyone shoot at once! - Wait! If you shoot the first bullet, the second bullet will send you to hell. Come on, get them! Shoot him! Shoot! Shoot! You two, get away. - But... - Go now! Junko, stay with me! Tsuno, shoot him! All right. Hey, Ryuzo, shoot him. Shoot him! Brother! No, Detective. I'm going to help you. Drop it! Policewoman Sato, thanks! Katsuo Shino, surrender. You're Ryuzo, "the shooting star", right? The man who killed your Boss... Brother! I have to confess I told you another lie. I know. - It was you, Mr. Tsuno. - Forgive me. I... was paid by Tokuzo Yuuki to do it. I'm going to die, anyways. Take your revenge now. What will you do? Ryuzo, I've contacted the local police of Aomori. They're going to arrest Tokuzo Yuuki. Detective, I'm in your hands. Policewoman Sato, what would you do? We'll question him, then release him with a misdemeanor. - I'll let him return to his lover. - Well done. Brother... Huh? I wish you all much happiness. - Goodbye. - Take care. Thank you. Farewell.
