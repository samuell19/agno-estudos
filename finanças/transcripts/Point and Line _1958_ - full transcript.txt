TOEI COMPANY, LTD Presents Points and Lines Cast MINAMI Hiroshi TAKAMINE Mieko Directed by KOBAYASHI Tsuneo They don't look like they're dead. That's because of the cyanide. Cyanide causes their face to tum pink. How long has it been since they died? It's been about ten hours. They died at around ten or eleven o'clock last night. Did they both drink the poison at the same time? Well... The cyanide was dissolved in juice. Did one of them force the other? They must have decided to die together. They're lying down side by side. They're dressed neatly. Their hands are joined in prayer. Their socks are clean. Their shoes are in order. I'm amazed. When I had the phone call, I thought it was a homicide. It's an easy case. It was very cold during the night. The flu is going around this time of year. The doctors must be happy. Mr. Torigai? Huh? What? Say it. I'm just wondering why they had to die in such a cold place. Cold? This is such a dreary place to commit suicide. It's just tasteless place to die. You only feel that way because you're still alive. When you die, it doesn't matter if it's cold or hot. FUKUOKA POLICE STATION A handkerchief, shoehorn, black leather wallet... There is... 9,730 yen. And... a business card holder. Department of Industry, Business Bureau, Business Division, Investigation Section. Assistant Section Chief. I wonder how much an Assistant Section Chief makes. Chief sounds good, but Assistant Chief sounds pathetic. His name is Sayama Ken'ichi. Her name is Toki. Tokyo Akasaka Japanese Restaurant Koyuki. A government official and a restaurant hostess. Hey, whom does this belong to? What? Oh, it belongs to the man. Isn't it a ticket for dining on the train? It's dated on October 14th... What's wrong? I see. This ticket is only for one person. The woman wasn't hungry, so she didn't eat anything. But... What? If they were on the same train... and if the man wanted to get something to eat... the woman would have gone with him. Women are always craving for food. If he ate something, she must have eaten something, too. You're absolutely right. I think... he was alone on October 14th when he got on Express Asakaze. Okay, okay. I'll tell you the truth. He did come to Hakata by himself. Huh? Detective Tasaka just found out that... he stayed at the Tanba Inn in Higashi Nakasu. He checked in on the night of October 14th. That's the same date as the dining ticket. He was alone when he arrived in Hakata. Then on the night of the 20th, around 8 o'clock, he got a phone call from a woman. He left the inn right after the phone call. The woman probably asked him to meet her. She must have followed him from Tokyo. I heard he was waiting for someone. I guess he was contacting her. They were found dead the very next day. You still look suspicious. Huh? The same train? That's no good. Okay. I understand. Could you go to the hospital with Ishii? Their relatives are there now. Yes... I don't know why but, they're refusing to talk to each other. You're going to have a hard time. I'm depending on you. You're an expert. Did you want to tell me something? Well... It's okay now. My brother was an idiot. She was just a hostess. He was too naive. She must have deceived him. She must have begged him to die with her. She killed my brother. Didn't you know about them at all? No, not until now. If I knew, I would have prevented this from happening. He didn't have to say that. He sounded like we killed his brother. We didn't know about them either. Wasn't he a customer of your restaurant? No. Nobody remembers him. We knew she had a boyfriend. But we were all shocked to find out who he was. I see. I saw them at the Tokyo station though... Tokyo station? Yes. It was during the late afternoon of the 14th. Did you see both of them? Are you sure? Was Toki there to take him to the train? No. It wasn't like that. They both boarded the train and looked very happy. LIEUTENANT MIHARA NORIKAZU How was it? Did it help you? Yes. It gave me a better understanding. I think it was a typical double suicide. It seems like it based on this report. We spent a whole month investigating this case. Do you need me? Oh yeah. He's from the Metropolitan Police Department. He's investigating Sayama Keiichi. I'm Mihara. I'm Torigai. I heard that you re suspicious about his death. I'm curious about it. Oh... You were talking about something the other day. I told Mr. Mihara what you said. He's very curious about it. Tell him what you said. Yes... You're absolutely right. You're a good detective. My boss wasn't in a good mood. So someone saw Sayama at the Tokyo Station. Her name is Yaeko. She used to work with Toki. Tomi and I took a guest to the station. We were on platform #13. There were no trains, so I could see platform #15 clearly. The train at platform #15 was the Express Asakaze to Hakata. We went to #15 to see the man with her. It was October 14th. On the same day, Sayama went to the diner alone. Thus, Toki must have gotten off the train before that. The dining room closes at 10 o'clock. The train makes a stop at Atami and Hamamatsu. So she must have gotten off at Atami or Hamamatsu. I wonder why she had to get off the train. Well... I asked everyone... who lives between this station and the shopping mall. Hello, sir. Thank you for your help the other day. Are you still working on the case? It must be a tough case. Not really... That man... He said that he saw them. Them? Do you mean Sayama and Toki? Yes. He saw them the night they committed suicide. I was so shocked! I heard about the suicide the very next morning. I saw them. I saw them walking together that night. Usually, not many people get off the train that arrives at 9:25 p.m. I remember that only about ten people got off that night. I was waiting for a customer who would buy fruit from me. I remember that the man was wearing an overcoat. The woman was wearing a wool coat. But I don't remember how they looked. They walked straight towards the West line of the Kashii Station. This is the West line of the Kashii Station. If you go this way, you'll reach the place where they died. It would be great if he remembered their faces. If he would, he could become a detective. I have another witness who saw them that night. He saw them this way. I got on the train that left Hakata Cycling Track at 9:27 p.m. I always catch that train, so I'm sure about the time. The train arrived here at 9:35 p.m. I was drunk that night, so I was walking slowly. A couple of people passed me from behind. Most people had familiar faces. But I had never seen that couple before. I still remember what she said when she passed by. This is a dreary place. A dreary place? That's what she said. She had a very clear voice. She spoke in a Tokyo dialect. She spoke differently from the people who live here. It surely is a dreary place. Although it's not a big deal where you die. You become picky when you commit a double suicide. You would pick places like hot springs or sightseeing spots. I don't understand many things on this case. They didn't see each other for a while. So, it's hard to believe that they committed suicide right away. They didn't even leave a suicide note. In the suicide cases I've worked on so far, they all left suicide notes. The only evidence that they committed suicide was the way their bodies lay... side by side. Mr. Mihara. Yes? It's been a month since they committed suicide. Why do you still have doubts about this case now? You don't have to answer if you don't want to. Let me tell you why. I bought this newspaper in Osaka yesterday. DIRECTOR ISHII DISCHARGED He was the central figure in a political scandal. Sayama had evidence about the scandal. When Sayama died, the evidence disappeared, so Ishii was discharged. There are more people who benefited from Sayama': death. So Sayama committed suicide to save his boss. Suicide? I wonder if he really committed suicide voluntarily. Someone could have forced him to do it. They must be wealthy people. It's not their money. People rarely use their own money. You, too. Right? It's nonsense. You work for the government. Right? See? I know that. He's a business man. You're from Tokyo, aren't you? Okay. Okay. You're negotiating commodity contracts for the government. If you make money, please spend it on me. Hey! It's empty! Oh, are you upset? Enough! You're scary. Idiot! Commodities, huh... She's insane. Bribes and kickbacks spread like an epidemic. You're right. It upsets me. I think that Sayama was just an ordinary person like us. An assistant section chief requires a lot of experience. He must have worked hard all these years. He worked hard to build his career. He had to give up on any promotion because... he didn't have any connections. But one day his boss revealed a secret to him. He then asked Sayama to take care of this confidential matter. Sayama must have been so excited. He must have been promised with a promotion. The privileged know how to manipulate other people. They use other people for their own advantage. Then when they get into trouble, their only concern is to protect themselves. They don't care what happens to subordinates. They deceived Sayama. I hold a similar position as Sayama. So I know how he must have felt. We were all shocked by his death. It's very disturbing. But someone must be laughing now. Director Ishii. Yes. I'll bet more people feel the same way. They must be celebrating. I have a hypothesis. Near the dead bodies of Sayama and Toki... I see another shadow there that night. That person must have killed them. Mr. Mihara. Thank you. I think I'm drunk. I envy you. Envy? I'm just an old detective. I'm past my prime. No, you're not! You've helped me a lot on this case. I wish you good luck! Thank you. I'll try my best. Yes. I found it. Really? Yes. There is no train at platform #13 and #14. So you can see the Asakaze at platform #15. Is that right? Is it wide open? Not really. It's only about four minutes. Four minutes? It couldn't have been a coincidence. It's too perfect. I have my doubts about the Fukuoka Station report. When you read the report, it implies that a suicide was committed. But it's too well done. They must be hiding something. Our Chief isn't interested in this case anymore. The investigation led us to a probable conclusion. He thinks we shouldn't continue with this case anymore. But I know you don't want to stop now. Boss! Do you want to find out the truth? It will be against the Chiefs orders, but... Yes! Let me do it! Okay. I'll talk it over with the Chief. About the witness at the Tokyo Station... I'm talking about the hostess from Koyuki. Her testimony is crucial. I checked the relationship between Sayama and Toki again. I couldn't find anything, not even a letter. It's very strange. They had an intimate relationship. But the only proof of their relationship is... her testimony that they looked like lovers. Boss, we need to interrogate that hostess again. Let's get started. Yes, sir! KOYUKI I want to ask you something. Is that okay? She wasn't happy when I told her you're a detective. If you have questions about our customers, I have no comment. I don't mean to cause you any trouble. She scolded me when she found out that I was a witness. See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Oh, well... Then I'm leaving. I'll issue a subpoena requiring you to report to the police station. See you! Wait a minute. Are you sure you were there at platform #13? Yes. It was the Yokosuka line. Who saw them first? We both saw them at the about the same time. Right? I think so... Look! Isn't that Toki? Oh yeah... That's Toki. She's with a man. He's handsome. Do you know him? I wonder who he is. Look! They boarded together. I'm jealous. Hey, make her treat you next time. I see... This is why she's been taking a vacation. They're going on a trip. So Mr. Yasuda saw them first? You didn't say that when you were at the Hakata Police Station. I think I did say that. No, you didn't. Can I have another one? I want an anmitsu. Excuse me! Can we have a shiruko and an anmitsu? Thank you. Who is Mr. Yasuda? He's one of our VIPs. He's an engineer. He was Toki's customer. He asked us to take him to the Tokyo Station that night. He asked us while we were having dinner at Cook Dole. Dinner? He came to our place the night before. He invited us to dinner. While having dinner... he asked you to take him to the Tokyo Station... huh? Seven more minutes. Did you see the clock? Are you going to make it? Don't worry. The train won't leave until 6:12 p.m. Was he worried that he would miss the train? No, I don't think so. He was hurrying there when... he looked towards platform #15 from platform #13. Sir? Please don't tell Madam what I told you. Please don't tell her that you fed us. Okay. What's wrong with Mr. Yasuda? Nothing... Just for our information. Do you know where his office is? YASUDA CORPORATION Tell him we're going to cancel it if they can't make the deadline. Thank you for waiting. I'm sorry to bother you. Thank you for coming. Please have a seat. How may I help you? I want to ask you about Mr. Sayama. Oh... Mr. Sayama... It was sad. He was such a nice person. Did you know him? Of course. He was working for me. It's hard to believe he committed suicide with a woman. I heard that... you saw Mr. Sayama and Toki at the Tokyo... Yes, I did. I knew both Mr. Sayama and Toki. I was so surprised. I can't believe they were on their way to commit suicide. Who told you that? The hostess from Koyuki told me that. I see. We didn't know about Sayama and Toki. I didn't tell the hostess I knew him. It's a small world. I was on my way to Kamakura that night. Everything he said sounds so plausible. He must have planned to have the hostess see Sayama and Toki. But why did he do that? Do you still need me? Did you know Toki very well? I knew her very well. Oh, our relationship wasn't anything special though. We were just a hostess and a customer. Wait a minute. I didn't know anything about Mr. Sayama and Toki. I guess I didn't know her that well. You're right. By the way... how often do you go to Kamakura? My wife lives there. I see. She has heart disease. I rented a house near the Gokuraku Temple. An old housekeeper is taking care of her. I only see her once a week. It must be tough. It's been three years now. Because I only see her once a week, she's become very precious to me. Thank you for all your help. You're welcome. Please let me know if you anything else from me. Oh, I forgot to ask you one more thing. Go ahead. Were you in Tokyo between October 20th and October 22nd? Am I a suspect? Oh, no. It's just for reference. Let's see... between October 20th and October 22nd? One moment please. On the night of October 20th... was this man standing by the bodies of Sayama and Toki? Oh, here it is... I was in Hokkaido. What? Hokkaido? We do business with the Futaba Co. in Sapporo. I was there and came back to Tokyo on the 25th. Would you like the details? Yes, please. I boarded the train from Ueno at 7:15 p.m. It was the Express Towada. I arrived in Aomori the next morning at 9:09 a.m. Hokkaido and Kyushu are total opposites. One is far to the west, and the other is far to the north. They're so far from each other. It's too far. Then... Mr. Kawanishi greeted me... Hello. Oh, it's you. What? The Sapporo Police Station in Hokkaido? What happened? Please ask them to investigate further. I'll give the details later. It wasn't a coincident that they saw Sayama in Tokyo. I think he planned it that way. What is his name? Yasuda... Tatsuo... Who is he? She answered the phone. Hello, Ryoko. The police may come to see you today or tomorrow. No, you don't have to worry. Ma'am... Is the guest here? How did you know? Mr. Mihara is here. Bring him here. It's nice to meet you. I'm Mihara. I met your husband the other day. I'm his wife. It's nice to meet you. I just wanted to wish you well. Thank you. But I don't think I can get well any soon. The weather is getting warmer, so you may feel better. It's warmer here than in Tokyo. The temperature here is three degrees warmer than in Tokyo. She's beautiful. She knows how beautiful her eyes are. How do you know my husband? Do you work with him? Well... kind of... He must give you a hard time. He can be very selfish. No, he isn't... Does he come here very often? He's always busy. But he comes here once a week. It's a good thing that he's busy. I feel bad for you though... Do you like it? Tropical fish? They are beautiful. My husband bought them for me. It's not easy to feed them. TIMETABLE I don't want to think about their eventual deaths. She has tuberculosis's. She's been sick for three years now. To be honest with you... She won't be cured. So she'll be bedridden for the rest of her life. She can get up sometimes. Can she go out? Yes. She can take a walk. She has relatives in Yugawara. She visits them sometimes and spends one or two nights there. Do you visit her house, too? I go to her house on Mondays and Fridays. Once in a while I visit her on Sundays. We talk about literature. Literature? Not much... though.. Excuse me... This is published by elderly people in Kamakura. She submitted an essay. It's very interesting. The title is "Scenery with Numbers." Does it sound interesting? She writes about timetables for trains. She looks at the timetables and uses her imagination. My husband left a timetable at my house once. I started reading it. I've been bedridden, so I can't travel. But it was very interesting to read. My husband buys timetables for his business trips. He's very good at using them. He uses the timetables for practical reasons. For me, it's simply fun to read. For example, she would have fun searching for trains... that would be making stops at the same time. She just enjoys doing that. While I'm lying in bed, all of the trains... are coming to a stop at this very moment. So many people are getting on and off right now. I close my eyes and try to imagine the scenes. What's your temperature? 100 degrees... What happened? You rested at home all day. I wonder what's wrong. It's my husband. I wonder... Hello? See? Hello. It's me. Yes, Mr. Mihara came here. Did he ask you that? He gave you a fruit basket. I have to thank him. Dear. Where are you calling from? Where are you? I'm still at my office in Nihonbashi. I'm going to be busy until the end of this month. I'm going home soon. What? I know... I'm going straight home. Good night. Take care. Who was it? I'd bet it wasn't a man. Didn't you say you wanted to go on a trip? Do you want me to take you to Hokkaido? It's very nice there. Or... do you want to go to Kyushu? Was it a woman? Wasn't it? You're right. She's very beautiful. According to Mr. Kawanishi of Futaba Trading Company, on October 21st, he met Yasuda in Sapporo. On the 22nd and 23rd, he stayed at the Maruso. Yasuda told the truth. I knew it. He wouldn't say anything that would make him look suspicious. He acts like a Mafia boss. I would love to meet with him. Everything he says is too good to be true. The telegram was probably correct, but... it's just showing the surface and not the deeper truth. You have good instincts. Boss, let me go to Hokkaido. I'd prove he's the one at the murder scene. Watch what you say. I'll find the evidence later. I have to arrest him first. I don't like him... huh... Boss, I went to check... Thank you for your hard work. This is the balance sheet for the Yasuda Corporation. This is their invoice to the government last year. I've been working hard, too. It's not a big amount but it has been increasing every month. I heard a rumor that Yasuda was very close to Ishii. Boss... I guess we have more to investigate. Let's do it. TOKIWA LINE #6 DEPARTURE 7:15 P.M. Good morning, everyone. We'll arrive in Aomori shortly. Thank you for traveling with us. If you are boarding a ferry to Hakodate, please fill out this form. SAPPORO INN MARUSO He arrived here around 9:00 p.m on October 21st. He stayed with us on the 22nd and 23rd. Are you sure that it was the 21st? I'm sure there's no mistake. FUTABA TRADING COMPANY Did you go to the station to meet him? Yes. I received a telegram from him the day before. He said that he was taking the Marimo Train. Do you always pick him up? No. He said it was urgent. He showed up ten minutes after the train arrived. Didn't you wait for him on the platform? No. He told me to wait for him in the waiting room. Has he done anything wrong? No. It's just for our reference. He's a great man. We've been doing business for five years. He is trustworthy... Do you have a lighter? Sony. You can't have him. We wasted our time. We just verified his alibi. If he boarded the train after killing them, the train would be still in Kyoto, when Mr. Kawanishi saw him in Sapporo. I know! Airplane! He came here on an airplane! Departure Fukuoka 8:10 p.m. Arrive Tokyo 12:10 p.m. Departure Tokyo 1:00 p.m. Arrive Sapporo 4:00 p.m. Oh, that's the one. Let's go. Where are we going? To the airport. I want to check the passenger list. Oh... Could you go back to the Maruso Inn first? We need to obtain the guest register as evidence. What about the airport? That's your job. I'm going to Hakodate. Hakodate? If he boarded the Marimo, he must have been registered for the ferry. I got it! The signature in the register of the inn and... the signature on the register of the ferry must be compared. We won't find his signature in the register of the ferry. HAKODATE October 21st, Ferry #17. Right? That's right. They are divided into 2nd and 3rd classes. Let me help you. What's his name? Thank you. This is his signature. Yasuda Tatsuo. It can't be found. It can't be found. It can't be found. Did you find it? No. It's not his. ISHIDA YOSHIO BUSINESS BUREAU He's a government employee. Yes, it is. Huh? Hold on please. Is Mr. Mihara here? Yes! You have a phone call. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Mihara? This is Tsuchiya. I checked the register, but I couldn't find his name. Hello? I couldn't find it. No. I couldn't find Yasuda': name in the register. Are you sure? It's not possible. I called the Tokyo office and got a list. 41 were registered for the 8:00 a.m. flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo. 59 were registered for the 1:00 p.m. flight from Tokyo to Sapporo. 46 were registered for the 2:50 p.m. flight from Tokyo to Sapporo. He wasn't registered on any of the flights. I also checked the flight on October 20th but couldn't find it. Hello? Hello? Hello? Mr. Mihara? Hello? I found it! I found it! Look! This is his signature. We normally keep this register for six months. This is not the first time it helped in a criminal investigation. Good morning. Good morning. Ishida! Someone asked me about you. Someone? I traced those people... I believe the police are asking questions about you. I'm trying not to be around our clients nowadays. That'd be better. You're going to be promoted soon. Any rumors will affect your promotion. They're trying to verify your alibi on October 20th. They're also investigating Yasuda Tatsuo. They want to know if you saw him in Hokkaido. Nice pat! That was great! Not really... I didn't do well today. I knew that. Two detectives went to Hokkaido to conduct an investigation on me. They found out that you were there on a business trip, too. Did they...? No way. They can't find anything on us. Don't worry. They have nothing. But they're not going to leave us alone. It can't be helped. I have another trick up my sleeve. What do you mean? You shouldn't feel threatened. We have to use this to our advantage. We can't use conjecture as evidence. We need hard evidence. We couldn't find his name in the register. We have to stop our investigation for now. Speaking of registration... We're conducting an investigation on each passenger. Okay. That's fine. What about the ferry? We found his signature on its register. It contradicts your hypothesis. It's me. What? I got it. It's about the passengers registered on the airplane. Every passenger boarded the plane except Yasuda. Boss! Mr. Sasaki, a ministry secretary, is here. I'm Sasaki. I'm here to convey a message from Director Ishii. Thank you for coming. Please have a seat. Someone asked Director Ishii about Yasuda Tatsuo. Yes... You're conducting an investigation on him. So I'm here to give you more information. Yasuda Tatsuo boarded the same train that... Director Ishii took on his way to Hokkaido on his business trip. They met and conversed with each other. Director Ishii told me to tell you that. I see. I see. If you say his words are unreliable, I have another witness for you. Talk to Inamura Shozo at the Hokkaido office. You're very thorough. Mr. Inamura get on the train in Hakodate and saw the director. As the train passed Otaru, Mr. Yasuda came to see them. He came to say good-bye to the director. Thank you for this information. Yasuda would be so delighted. What do you mean? Ask Yasuda. By the way, if you have any questions, just ask us. Don't make us look bad. Hey, you! You are Mr. Sayama': colleague, aren't you? You're so rude. Ishii trusts you like he trusted Mr. Sayama. What did he promise? A promotion? Mihara... Do you want to see a picture of Mr. Sayama': dead body? It's pitiful. I'll make you regret what you did to him. Stop it! I'm sorry... That was uncalled for. He could sue us for harassment. Boss! What? Yasuda must have boarded the Marimo at Otaru. He flew to Sapporo, boarded the train to Otaru and... boarded the Marimo which came from Hakodate. You... Listen... Mr. Inamura saw Yasuda after passing Otaru. Now it makes sense. Yasuda told Mr. Kawanishi to meet him in the waiting room. Yasuda prepared himself for any airline delays. Hey, hey... Forget about the timetables. You seem to be possessed. As for me, I dream about the numbers in the timetables. Why don't you go home now. If you would like to, you can take a short vacation. You've been working too hard. Are we going to stop this investigation? I'm not saying that. Why are you telling me to take a vacation? Are we giving up on this investigation? Boss! Sasaki went to Hokkaido with Director Ishii. Sasaki? Who told you that? I heard it from Sasaki': son. Sasaki brought back a wooden bear from Hokkaido for him. A wooden bear. I should confirm it with their office. Usually a secretary doesn't travel with his boss. I guess it was too early to give up on this case. It's definitely too early. Sasaki must have also been involved with the murder. His story sounded very suspicious. Let's investigate him. Do you know anything about this? I know Mr. Yasuda. I wonder if you inadvertently submitted Mr. Yasuda': ticket. We couldn't find your name in the register. But you boarded the ferry on October 20th. Don't you remember? Look at this again. You can get a registration card at the window anytime. You got this in advance and had Yasuda sign it. Then when you boarded the ferry you gave this to them. It's ridiculous. Didn't you ask the conductor to send a telegram? You used Yasuda': name and... had it sent to the Futaba Trading Company in Sapporo. The right to be silent... huh? I'm not a criminal. Don't be so rude. You're so arrogant. That's not good. Be nice to the man. We should have a pleasant talk. We don't have much time, so... please cooperate. Do you know these three gentlemen? Miyamoto Masao Yamamoto Steel Co. Tamiya Shinji Shiraishi Machine Trading Co. Miyake Ichiro Akuta Metal Co. No, I don't know them. Excuse me. Does my smoking bother you? No, I'm fine. These three gentlemen were each asked a favor by Director Ishii. For the purpose of a secret business trip, he got permission to use their names for airline reservations. You asked them to tell others that they actually boarded the plains. I don't know what you're talking about. You used Mr. Miyamoto': name for the flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka. You used Mr. Tamiya': name for the flight from Fukuoka to Tokyo. You used Mr. Miyake': name for the flight from Tokyo to Sapporo. I don't remember... They said you asked them. That's impossible. Should I bring them here? I don't know anything. Mihara... Let's bring them here. Yes, sir. Wait a minute! You're sweating. Bring him a glass of water. Have one. Yasuda doesn't have an alibi now. Isn't it too early to say that? No, not really. Now it's possible for Yasuda to be at the murder scene. We have a new scenario that places Yasuda there. What's the relationship between Yasuda and the double suicide? We still have doubts about the double suicide. We haven't found any love letters... We haven't even confirmed that they had a special relationship. A woman must be the key to finding out their relationship. Chief... I've told you about Detective Torigai at the Fukuoka Police Dept. Oh, I've heard about him. He has information for us. He arrived in Tokyo this morning. He's been waiting for us. Ask him to come in. It's about the street between the National and the West railways. It's bout 500m long and takes about 6 minutes to walk. The owner of a fruit shop saw a couple at the National Railway Line. Then more than 10 minutes later, a couple passed by the man who... got off the train at the Kashii Station on the West Railway Line. That's strange. You're saying that... There must have been a couple besides Sayama and Toki. You're right. Yasuda was with a woman. A woman... He may be coming here today. I think so, too. He must be coming here. You seem to know everything. Do we have any beer? Yes... Oh, you are right. Let me answer the phone. Hello... oh, Doctor Hasegawa. No. I was just expecting a call. Huh? The police? Yes, four detectives came here to examine your medical records. Yes. They came about an hour ago. I wasn't in the office. Which one? They checked your late October records. October? I have no idea why. If I were here, I wouldn't have let them violate your privacy. I'm so sorry... Hello? Madam? I'm going to Asagaya. Get my suitcase please. Are you going on a trip? Don't worry. Of course I remember her. She was very beautiful. Most geisha aren't that attractive. Sumi? She was your guest. You must remember her, too. Yes, Ma'am. Excuse me. Yes? Your guest is here. Do you remember the woman, too? Yes, she was about 25 to 26 years old. Is this her? Yes. She stayed four to five nights with us. Can I see her registration? Yes, sir. Bring me the register. What else do you remember? They left for Hakata on the Express at 10:00 p.m. Hakata? Yes. We bought the tickets for them. Mrs. Yasuda paid for everything. Thank you for staying with us. It means... they knew each other. Sometimes... our instincts are better than yours. What did you think? Toki was her husband's mistress. It makes sense. I can't believe that he had a mistress. Anything is possible for Yasuda. Then what's the relationship between Sayama and Toki? They're just acquaintances. No wonder we couldn't find any love letters. Since they weren't lovers, he needed a witness who could testify about their relationship. That's why the four minutes in Tokyo was crucial to him. Is that right? Is that the kind of husband and wife they are... Welcome home. Close the gate. Welcome home. Tell any guests that the Master isn't home. Do you understand? Yes, ma'am. It's ridiculous. It's risky for me, too. You intentionally put me in a very difficult position. Wait a minute. You liked that idea at first. But you became too arrogant. What's so funny? It's so ridiculous. Be serious! I'm sorry if I made a mistake. I've lost any chance for a promotion and... status as a government official. You ruined my whole life. I... I never... I didn't tell you to kill Sayama. Don't you remember? All I said was... if I could put the responsibility on him. Don't we always depend on our subordinates? I was desperate because I was under investigation by the police. You found out about that. You said that you would take care of Sayama. Instead all you wanted was a business favor. You deceived me. You've made more than five million yen in these six months. All you wanted was money. You told me not to worry, so I relied on you. I never thought you would kill him with cyanide. You did everything on your own. I had nothing to do with this. I know nothing. What did you say? Say it again? I did everything? Say that again when you get arrested. No one will believe you. If you ask your subordinate to take on a responsibility, it's the same thing as asking him to die for you. Status and promotion... Are they that important? I guess so... You sacrificed someone's life to protect your status. Hello. Darling? Trip? Really? Are we going on a trip? Lower the volume. Can you hear me? Five o'clock. Come to my house in Asagaya. Don't tell anyone about this. What? Of course, it'll only be the two of us. Are you done? Let me open the door. Is Mr. Yasuda home? Who are you? No. You may not come in. Who are you? Tell me who you are first. I'm his wife. His wife? You're his wife... Hello. It's me. What? Did find out? Please prepare an arrest warrant. Yes. I'm afraid he's going to run. I'm heading to his house in Asagaya. Okay. I got it. Hello. Please issue an arrest warrant for bribery and murder. The address is Suginami-ku, Asagaya 235. The name is Yasuda Tatsuo. He's 42 years old. His wife's name is Ryoko. She's 28 years old. She's undergoing treatment for T.B. I feel sorry for the wives. Now it's clear why it was Toki who died with Sayama. Ryoko and Toki arrived in Hakata at 7:45p.m. on the 20th. Director Ishii must have told him to hide in Hakata. He must have been told to wait until Yasuda called. Hello. Sayama speaking. Mr. Yasuda? Oh... Mrs. Yasuda. Mrs. Yasuda called Sayama on behalf of her husband. When we saw the dead bodies of a man and a woman, we assumed that it was a double suicide. The owner of the fruit shop felt the same way. This is such a dreary place. Toki had such bad luck. He could easily find replacement for her. I'm wondering if... his wife planned all of this, not Yasuda himself. I agree with you. Ryoko might have been obsessed about killing Toki, not Sayama. I feel sorry for her. No. I don't think we should sympathize with anyone in this case. I can't forgive anyone... especially Ryoko. Welcome home. Did a woman come to see me? No, sir. Sir... I'm going out soon. I'll be gone for a while. I want something to eat. Let me have a beer before that. Yes, sir. Who's that? It's me. Oh, it's you. Are you going on a trip? Yes. It's a business trip. I won't see you for a while. Why are you here? You're going to have a high fever. I have a favor to ask. Please don't go on the trip. What? Ryoko? I'm lonely. Please stay with me. I can't lie... Please... Are you okay? It's not my fault if your condition gets worse. Are you satisfied? Let me go. No. Let me go. I have to rinse my mouth. You're the one who always tells me to rinse my mouth. She's not there? Don't lie. I know. No, she's not. She's really not here. Are you going to tell him you met his wife? Of course! Idiot! I never said I didn't have a wife. Come to my apartment... at 11.00 p.m. Okay? Do you understand? What? Promise? Okay, okay. You're going to be my wife. I'm leaving soon. I'm going to meet Mr. Otsu at the train station. What time does it leave? I don't remember... I just wanted him to be my husband. But I'm too sick to take care of him. That's why I let Toki be his mistress. I hated Toki so much. Are you still talking about her? Even though I'm not healthy enough to be a true wife to you, I couldn't stand the thought that another woman was taking care of you. I tried to be a good wife, even when I found out about Toki. As long as you loved me... But I still hated her. Ryoko! Ryoko! Dear, I'm here. Hey. Which local line is the Tenryukyo? Are you really going? Couldn't you please stay? Enough! Hey. Where should I transfer trains? The Tatsuno station of the Central Line. I see. It's not The Shinetsu Line. I can see the small train running through the valley. The lida Line... This is it! Tatsuno... Inashi... Akaho... Inaojima... Ichida... Iida... Tenryukyo... Damn it! Hello. This is Kasai. The suspects are dead. Send someone for an autopsy on two bodies. What? It looks like a double suicide. The End
