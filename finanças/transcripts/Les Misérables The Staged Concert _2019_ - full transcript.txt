Thank you. Thank you so much. An extraordinary night, an extraordinary 16 weeks, an extraordinary 34 years. Um, one of, one of the beauties, one of the joys about "Les Mis," none of us anticipated what would happen, uh, 34 years ago. Uh, one of the joys about being in a show like this is watching people grow into the next stage of their roles. We have little Gavroches, uh, little Eponines, we have little Cosettes growing up and going on to lead roles and then going into the older roles. I fall into that category. Um, tonight will probably be the last time I sing Javert in the West End. Um... Yeah, I know. You're thrilled. Uh, and the part is gonna be played next door, uh, at the new Sondheim Theatre by the man who was brilliant tonight as Enjolras, Mr. Bradley Jaden. So... Here's the coat.

It's my great honor to introduce to the stage our esteemed composer of "Les Miserables," Claude-Michel Schonberg, and our wonderful producer, Sir Cameron Mackintosh. I... I... I'll be honest. I'm completely overwhelmed at the response we've had to this amazing production with its extraordinary, extraordinary cast and five of my most beautiful Jean Valjeans. It's, it's, it's been extraordinary. The wonderful thing about "Les Mis" is that whenever there's a special occasion, everyone comes together and says, "We'd love to be part of something," and we had, with the Sondheim being rebuilt next door... That's gonna be rather nice, and open in two weeks, I hope, and, uh, we are... No, it will, because I'm, I'm handing out brochures later on. It will. But, no, I had no idea, in my dreams, that it would turn out as extraordinary as it has. And it, thanks to... I rang up Michael and Alfie and Matt and said, "Would you come and do it again?" And they immediately said, "Yes, of course. We'd love to." And then all my wonderful friends, old friends and wonderful new friends that have come together, one of the most incredible companies I've ever had in my life. And... It... it seemed only yesterday we said hello and now we're saying goodbye, but except you never say goodbye with "Les Miserables." It's always au revoir because, uh, tomorrow always seems to come for "Les Miserables" and that is thanks to you, the public. All of us owe so much to the public who always continue to embrace the show and keep it timeless. But without three special people, I would never have ever been able to imagine this show, and that is the two people who thought of the show, was Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg. It was their creation that I heard in Paris and then brought to England, and where the wonderful words of Herbert Kretzmer, who is up here in the box today, inspiring words of Herbert. Set it to music. So, like you, I never tire of listening to the beautiful music from our composer. And our composer is also, to my great gratitude, also one of my oldest friends. Ladies and gentlemen, Claude-Michel Schonberg. As you understand, I'm not alone on stage tonight. I have the wonderful lyricist, Herbert Kretzmer and my partner, Alain Boublil. Partner... We working only together, eh. - What did you say, Matt? - What did I say? Yeah, did you say something? - I said nothing at all. - Not for me! Anyway, the three of us, we can only say thank you to Cameron for putting together such a wonderful company who have been doing this show, night after night, during 17 weeks, with the wonderful orchestra, with Alfonso directing, and with a wonderful audience. We can never thank you enough. But something has been bothering me tonight. It's when I heard the duet of the Valjeans I realized that Bradley had all the high notes and not Michael. So... It's true, huh? So I'm wondering if the original Marius... 34 years ago... Yeah, thanks for that. can still hit the high notes he used to do every night. I'll give it a go. - Will you try? - I'll give it a go.
