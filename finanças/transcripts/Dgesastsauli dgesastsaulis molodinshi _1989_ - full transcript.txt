HOLIDAY IN EXPECTATION OF A HOLIDAY Part 1: Tea-drinking and Love For Sea - You promised to go. I beg you. - You lie all the time. - Leave me alone! I said - tomorrow, that's it. - Liosik! Watch out! You'll fall! - Honestly, it's not us. - We know that he's your friend. Believe, Boche? I believe in you. How many times have I told you not to turn around when they call you. Come on. Batum! Batum! Batum! Soiled water. Son of a bitch! - Well, bye then! - I'm going. Batum! When the guys from our street began to show off their relatives, I was silent. I let them speak. The military were held in the highest category. But even among the military there was its own subordination. In the first place were the border guards. On the second - pilots, and the third - tankers. Firefighters were out of competition. I, as an evil, no relative has served in the army. But I had my own special trump card. "And my uncle is crazy", I said in a calm voice. By pushing too real heroes of their comrades for some time. You can become a pilot and a border guard if you study well. So, at least, adults claimed. And you will not become crazy, whether you are the best student. Of course, if you don't overlearn. But that didn't threaten us. ...But my biggest fan... ...was... ...it may seem strange to you, but he was... ...Prince of Oldenburg. Teases Kolya! Kolya! What's happening there? Chik! Again teasing him? No, aunt. It's him. - Hello, Eugenia Aleksandrovna. - Hello, child. Chik, come here, my helper. Kolya, your tea is getting cold. I never had a thought that... ...I could see the prince like that. But you can see from the fate you will not leave. Hat! In one of his manors our relative worked as a gardener. Eat a pie first. And somehow my dad and me went to Gagra. Well, he had some business there. And we decided to visit this relative. And it was exactly that hour... ...when the prince came there with his escort to look at his peach garden. What a beautiful day it was. The garden was blooming... There was one contradiction in this story, which confused me greatly. And sometimes even annoyed. According to some stories of my aunt, it turns out that she was a little girl at the time. As for others, it seems that she's already quite an adult girl and the prince became interested in her beauty. Now my aunt expounded exactly the second option. I'll not hide that, Eugenia Aleksandrovna. The prince admired my beauty. Yes... And it went... He started courting me. Sent me a huge baskets of roses with scented notes by messenger. Onik's father was called Suren, but they named him the "Rich Tailor." First behind the back, but then, seeing that he was not offended, they began to call even in the face. "How rich am I?" - He used to say, gently waving away from the nickname. My Onik... My little bird... - OK, Dad! - Chik! Not going out? My Onik, pretty girl... My rose... Play, Rose! Play! Come on, to your place! Go! I will go to this Askhatu on our street myself! If he's really going to ask you to meet him... ...don't you dare to say a single word to him! Do you understand me? Of course, Dad. By my mom's name, I'll not talk to him. Adults are talking that the "Rich Tailor" is afraid of a tax inspector, and in order to drown out the sound of a sewing machine, he deliberately makes Rosa play for a long time. Eat another pie. Where did I stop at? Yes... ...then I plucked a few orchids and dried them. They still lie in my Pushkin's volume. And imagine, still fragrant. How is the market, Faina? They are all crazy out there. Worse than your brother. Soon the potatoes will be more expensive than gold. What a woman! Complains all her life, and always comes back with full baskets from the market. Well, where did I stop at, honey? You said that the Prince of Oldenburg was a very rich man... Well, what are saying! He was a billionaire. That day he took me in his roadster and drove around the city. It was awesome. Everybody was dying of envy. The last Russian nobleman and the first Soviet palmist! Oh, Eugenia Aleksandrovna, you'll see something exciting now! Where? Where?! Come here! Come here. Eat, please. Rest for a while and get started on your homework. And if you want to go see a palmist, everything is perfectly visible from here. Go. The last Russian nobleman and the first Soviet palmist! - What a donkey! - The last Russian nobleman... ...and the first Soviet palmist! Hurry to find out your fate, citizens! - Aniko! - Soviet women! You can have a dazzling fate too! Hurry up! I'll tell it for just 30 copecks. - I'm coming! - Well, don't bother you there! Faster! Claptrap - your fortune telling. Claptrap. No one will believe. You'll not see this anywhere else! I appeal to you - the last Russian nobleman and the first Soviet palmist! Well, dear ladies, you understand who you will guess? I seem to understand. - Go away, children! You don't belong here! - Get out of here! - Well, how do you like it? - Just great. - Take another peach. - Thank you, I don't want anymore. - Well, who's the first? I beg. - Give it here... - Me... Well, let's see. Your life line is long. Yes... Stay still. The fate has changed several times. You rose, then fell. But not broken. Your heart is generous, kind. You have very expressed Venine hill. Claptrap! Well, what else can I say? I can't call you a minx, but you love to flirt. Alikhan loved his tattered Dasha very much. Because of her turbulent past and the scruffy present in the yard, Dasha was considered a bad wife. Alikhan believed that his wife is the same as the others. But the courtyard, and especially the Rich Tailor, reminded him from time to time... ...that his wife is not quite like the others, but perhaps worse. - ...and that man is bright and... - Eh... Is this really a thing? In our times, only a craft can bring a solid piece of bread to a person. - Take me... - Let him guess. Every person wants to have his own small craft. But fans still loves you. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Well? Who's next? - Tell me, please. You have a hand no worse than that of the lady. The lines you have are very clear. You are loyal to the family. You find happiness in raising children. As you say, Surenchik. - But it seems that your loyalty... - Alikhan! You're not a man. - Why? - My wife is a Russian. - And your's the same. - So what? No, nothing. My wife is a Russian, but still, act like an Armenian. She understands everything. Only doesn't speak. Every woman, Sura-jan, has her own little hand. Don't pretend it's so nice. I still won't believe. May cholera takes you! Instead of dreaming of pleasures, I'd better be sure if my site is guarded. Never! Think before it's too late. I was born a merchant, and a merchant will die! So you'd know! So... And now I will treat you a real Turkish coffee. - Oh... We so nicely had a tea. - And now we will have coffee. Especially, since you, in Russia, have no idea what real Turkish coffee is. And in that hour of a delightful meeting... What are you waiting for? Get down! I'll go see how to make Turkish coffee. Onik, Onik! Wait for me, I'm coming down now. Here's the fool! Teases Kolya! - Are you crazy?! - What else is there, Chik? I don't know! He quibbles me! What's the matter? Hat, Kolya! And in that hour of a delightful meeting... Only a month looking out the window... Well? What's the matter? Air throws at Kolya! I just looked, and it seemed to him that I was breathing on him. What, are you completely crazy, Kolya? Fascinated by her conversation with Yeugenia Alexandrovna, the aunt made a mistake in dealing with her brother. The insults of the assumption that he was insane, finally infuriated his uncle. - I'm crazy?! - You're crazy. It's you who's crazy! And he's crazy! Calm down! Kolya! You're not crazy. He seems to be start brawling again. Today it's hot. Sometimes Chik was released to the sea with his crazy uncle. Uncle alone wasn't allowed to go as a madman, while Chik wasn't allowed to go alone, because he was still a kid. Therefore, together they were allowed to go. Chik was released as a child with an adult, while Chik's Uncle was released as a madman with a reasonable person. During the heat, my uncle sometimes started to buzz, and the sea baths soothed him. It's really hot. How I didn't realized it myself? Chik, would you go to the sea with him? Go, please. You can do the homework later. You don't mind swimming in this heat, do you, Chik? Okay, I'll go. - Sea, Sea... - Sea... Sea, Sea. - Fishing rod? - Fishing rod, fishing rod. Go, go. Take a peach. Fishing rod! Chik, look after him there, do you hear me? - So where did I stopped at? - You said... Splash him! He doesn't love us! - I'm jumping! - I'm jumping! Come on! Splash him! Splash him! - Did you swam, Chik? - Swim! We'll soon too! Wait for me! Chik couldn't understand one thing: how do people living by the sea doesn't like to go to the sea? And there were many people like that. Auntie was also like that. Every time Chik went to the sea... ...before meeting the sea, he had an overwhelming excitement, which he couldn't explain. It was like a fear that suddenly the sea would be out of place. Or some kind of force will prevent him from meeting the sea. Or suddenly the police forbids swimming in the sea. I don't know how about you, but I have to go. Me too. Actually, me too. Chik, are you not going home? Onik, tell my aunt that we will come soon. I promised him we'll do a little fishing. Fishing?! Fishing rod! Fishing rod! - I don't know how about you, but my mother is waiting for me. - Bye, Chik! - I would stay, Chik, but probably my father is already looking for me. - Me too. Of course, go. Sea! Fishing rod! Fishing. - Okay, let's go. - Fishing, Chik. Give me a hand. Fishing rod?! Be careful, don't stumble. Well done. Sea. Fishing. Well, sit down. Sit down. Like this. My aunt has so many books, if I'd read them all, it would be enough for a lifetime. - My dad arrived! - Dad! Dad! - And what are these books about? - About anything. There's also about love, just I don't read these books. Dad, give me something! Want some money? They're hard to earn. Walnuts will be enough for you. - Get out of here! - Dad, give me something. All day didn't eat anything. - Here's a cucumber. - And who pays for a cucumber? Shut up! Go, stand aside! May God be with you. Here's a kopeck, buy something. Come back home before dark. Go, go. - Go! Go! - Don't tease donkey! Give me some! Give me some more! It's not enough for me. I'm going. Of all the books, and all the films, the most powerful person is still Captain Nemo! In a book I'm reading, there's a spy, he's also a very strong personality. For several years he pretended to be deaf and dumb. But our counterintelligence officer suspected him and shot a bullet over his head! - But he didn't even flinched! Not even a blink! - That's a thing! Fi! I can't stand spy books. Oh yes, I know. One kid in a pioneer camp spoke about this book to me. When the spy fell asleep, he ceased to be a strong personality. Is it true? Don't tell! Otherwise, it will not be interesting to read. I find it interesting to read a book the second time. Well, we're going, guys. What a thing, the spy falls asleep... I have better books. That's true. - Bye. - Bye. - Chik, will you lend me this book later? - Of course, Bochi. I'll read it in one of these days, and then I'll lend it to you for at least a whole month. - Is that okay? - Okay. - Will you lend it for me too? - And you too. OK, bye. - Bye! - Goodbye! - Bye, Bochi! Don't hustle. Chik, would you really give them this book, or did you say it on a purpose? Shurik and Bochi are not bad guys. We'll be friends with them. - In general, they're not bad. - Only they're fighters. They don't fight with us. Othe other day I saw how three of them beat one kid. We'll not remember this. It wasn't the main thing that the spy spoke in a dream in German and the boy exposed him. And the other boy also heard the spy talking in a dream, but he couldn't expose him, as he poorly studied German and didn't understand a thing he said. The main thing was that the spy pretended to be deaf and dumb. Suddenly, Chik's thought made a brilliant leap. I realized that my uncle wasn't crazy at all, but a real spy! The only thing that embarrassed Chik... ...was that Grandma remembered Kolya from an early age. But he quickly overturned this obstacle. The uncle was crazy, but the spies learned his habits and buzzwords. And one day they stole his uncle, and instead of him slipped a spy. Chik began to recall that there was a lot of suspicious behavior of his uncle. For example, a fishing rod without hooks. Maybe inside the rod was a secret radio? And he passed on the information to an enemy submarine. Here! He's looking, looking! Will you ever let me leave quietly, eh? Well, let him watch. Let him watch. What do you suggest, poke his eyes out or something? And don't look at him, Kolya. If it annoys you. He's teasing! - Come out! Leave him! Do something. Hat, Kolya! Stand up. Clean the dishes. After all, Dr. Zhdan himself says that you need physical exercises... - He's teasing! - You're older than him, Kolya. "It's all clear!" - Chik guessed. He pushes in here his transmitter, and then takes it out and hides it. And in that hour of a delightful meeting... Your career is over, Colonel Lawrence. Leave me alone! I don't know where I got it from, that he's Colonel Lawrence. Apparently, I trusted intuition, like many brilliant counterintelligencies. You played your part well, Colonel. But we didn't sleeping. Boy! Crazy one! "Dodges, Rogue!" - I thought. And then decided it was time for a hint. Fish don't bite? Ocean is shaking? Or fishing rod is not suitable? Fishing rod?! Fishing rod! You fell for your bait, Colonel! Don't move! The house is surrounded. Son of a bitch! Batum! Batum! Instead of giving up with dignity and saying: "This time you outwitted me, Lieutenant." He ran for the fishing rod, as if it'd make any difference. Stole the fishing rod! - Son of a bitch! - Voluntary recognition will ease your lot! Name the accomplices! Die! Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother! Grandmother! So what happened? What? - Boy! Fishing rod! - Okay, take it easy. Sit down. Sit down. - Fishing rod! - Take it easy. Everything will be fine. I suddenly felt a pity for him. I somehow realized that he'd never be able to justify himself in his life. But I, in fact, spoiled his fishing rod. But admit it to himself that he's guilty for all that, he lacked courage. - Stole the fishing rod! - Fine, fine. You don't need to beat the boy anyway. - Crazy! - He's small. Grandma! He didn't beat me. He wanted to beat, but was not fast enough. Okay, calm down, the both of you. And now Kolya will go and bring water. - I'll go for water! - Chik, wait! - Kolya! Kolya water! - Of course, Kolya. Sit for a while, rest. And then you go. I was ashamed of not telling the truth, but so happened. But I no longer suspected Uncle Kolya of relations with foreign intelligence. And for a long time after this I lost the desire to tease him. Chik! Kolya will go for water. You better go to the market. Put the jacket on. As the rain might come. Come here, I'll tell you what to buy. Already stopped raining. I will go, Uncle Alikhan. - Take something else. - No, thanks. Okay. Hello, Kerobchik. [Welcomes in Armenian] [Welcomes in Armenian] Why are you bargaining here, Alikhan? - I have permission, Kerobchik. - Oh, permission? And who allowed, Alikhan? Police allowed, Kerobchik. - Ah, the police... - Of course. The head of the market also allowed. - The head of the market... - Yes. You have to ask me for permission, Alikhan. Got it? Chik's heart was breaking with pity and indignation... ...from the meanness of Kerobchik and his friends. Oh, if Chik had a gun! He would have put all five in one line! He would scribble and scribbled at them already fallen on the ground... ...and writhing in pain, until the disk is empty. Don't cry, Uncle Alikhan. I will collect everything. This, in my opinion, can be sold. Guys, Motya is coming! A year ago, he appeared in Muhus, and so immediately elevated above the local criminals... ...and half-criminal that it never occurred to anyone to compete with him. It was believed that even the bullet doesn't take him. And therefore he had the nickname "Wooden Motya". Motya's eyes, which hides something, was a source of Chik's secret delight. Chik knew that it was these eyes that Jack London's favorite characters were. Who? Kerobchik. He says he wants to teach. Came and turned it over with his foot. Scaring old men? I will show him. Motya! Clean the boots? He always cleans. Everybody knows. Chik, go get some bread. I really don't want to go. Okay, throw the money. I'll leave it here. - Hi, Chik. - Hello. Washing for all the sailors, skinny crew? Wash, wash. Fuck off! You scarecrow! [Speaking Armenian] Chik, please, don't go for bread anymore if Lika asks you, okay? - But, Aunt Khana. - No. I just want her to learn how to help me. - Will you come up to us? - Yes. I'll be back soon. Thanks, Chik. Come on in. Come in, Chik. Come in. Sit on the sofa. - Help yourself. Take the apple. - No, I don't want it. - Take it. - No, I don't want it. - Well, then a cookie. - I don't want it either. - What's with you, Chik? - Nothing. It's okay. Do you want me to put your favorite record? Put it on. Well, I'll be going. Wait. Do you want me to play the other side? - No, I'd better go. - Well, as you wish. Like this, Kolya... Kolya is a good one. Good Kolya. - Why so long, Chik? - I wasn't long. Listen, hold his ear, eh? Okay, wash them. Well? Wait a little bit. Like this. Lunch will be ready soon. Aren't you hungry? No. Let go. That's all. Don't go far. Uncle Suren, Onik's home? He called you, Chik, but you weren't at home. I let him go to the park. If you'll go there for a walk, please don't stay for a long. - Hello, Chik. - Hello, Aunt Larissa. - How are you? How's home? - Thank you, good. - How is your aunt, grandmother? - They're okay, thank you. - And how's poor Kolya? - Fine. Are you in a hurry somewhere, Chik? - No, I... - Well, go, go, I won't detain you. Tell your aunt that I'll come the other day. - Come, of course. - Goodbye. What are you doing? Nothing. Missed again! And why are you so happy? Coward! I take, again. - Hi, Chik! - Hi. - You haven't seen Onik? - No, Onik wasn't here. I take, again. These are mine. These too. And once again. That's all. I won everything! Who else wants to play? - There's nothing left to play with. - Well, who else will play with me? If you have money, you can play with him. Of course I have. Let's play. Throw the first. Catch it. - Far away. - Give me. - That was close! - Oh, how great. - Chik first! Missed! Take it. Again. Missed again. What a hell! Wow, great! Missed. Well done, Andrey. Chik missed again. Come on, quit! What are you waiting for? Leave me alone! - Now it's my turn! - Look, guys, Ryzhik fights! - Look at them! - Separate them! Well done! get off, and then I'll beat the truth! Don't give up, Reyzhik! Then take them! I'll show you now! Come on, let him go. Let go, I say! Release him! He didn't do anything wrong. - Please! Let me go! - Don't hit him! He's small! - Let me go! Uncle! - Silence! Let me go! - Let me go, I said! - You will get it from me now! What, are you biting, little wolf? I'll show you now! - Run away! - Come on, run! You where, Chik? Leaving. I did it with one hand! Then the other one! And then, as he turned around and hit his head directly into the stomach! - He barely survived! - Well done, Ryzhik! - I even seen sparks in his eyes! - Guys! Chik's coming. Hero's coming! Chik. Let's start: one, two, three, four, five, six... Chik considered it humiliating for him to prove... ...that this little scamp couldn't defeat him. He also considered it shameful to demand a testimony... ...of the fight witnesses. Guys, who's that Chik of you? So it's you Chik? Yes, me. Hi! We just wanted to see what you are. It's you who fought with little Ryzhik? I also want to see who beat the little Ryzhik. It's Ryzhik who fought with Chik. Chik doesn't fight with kids. You might be missing me. Give me the way. What are you doing here? Come on, go out of here. Among the other things, why Chik did love this place... ...was that from here he could see everyone. And no one saw him. Here he could hide from everyone. Chik loved people, but sometimes they bored him greatly. And then he climbs a pear tree... And sits there until the people stops to bother him. He used to sit there for an hour. Or two hours. And then he climbs off and starts to feel that people no longer bother him. Chik knew, and the whole yard knew... ...that Uncle Kolya loves Sonkin's mother aunt Faina from immemorial time unmatched and stubborn love. But he couldn't understand why he chose her? The most filthy, most freckled, most stupid woman from their yard, and what a mysterious pleasure was for him to watch... ...how dirty Aunt Faina is busy in her cluttered kitchen. Chik! Where are you? Come eat lunch! Kolya? What are you doing there? Come on, better go home! Again! Lord, what a punishment! Tsizira, put a bucket. Does Natella got you a coffee? [Indistinguishable background talks] Listen, leave this woman alone. Like me, Romeo. Chik! Throw me a bunch of grapes. Take this! Chik! Throw me a pear now! Not this one! That one! Listen, take what I give you. This boy studied with Chik in the same school. Just been from another class. In fact, this boy was considered as a mama's sissyboy and wasn't much appreciated by Chick and the other guys. Chik, why are you sitting in a tree all the time? So I could throw you pears and grapes. No, Chik, for real? Why are you sitting in a tree for so long? Throw me some grapes. You won't be enough with your belly. Aside from jokes, Chik, why are you sitting in a tree for so long? I'm never a tear from here now. - Mom, Chik says he will never get off the tree. - Well, then he'll die of hunger. Chik, but you'll die of hunger. No. I'll eat pears, grapes, figs... And you'll throw me some bread through the window. Mom, Chik says that he'll eat fruits, and I'll throw him bread through the window. Chik, but I can't throw bread out through the window. So pears and grapes can be thrown through the window, but bread can't be? - Chik, don't distract him from his homework. - He first started. And you mind your own business. Among the guys of his courtyard, and even among classmates, Chik considered himself as a main one. Of course, he didn't say that. That would be too stupid. But he considered it quite fair. "And now, after this stupid fight... ...even this patsy can probably stop counting me as the main one." - Chik thought.
