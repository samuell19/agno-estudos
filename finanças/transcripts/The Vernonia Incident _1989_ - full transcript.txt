[booming] [horn honking] [thudding] [fire rumbling] See if you can get some news on the radio. [upbeat radio music] [Bike groaning] [laughing] Do people really listen to this stuff out here? [radio tuning] [News Reporter] An excessive manhunt is under way at this hour for two heavily armed men who robbed a grocery store in the city of Vernonia. The suspects entered the Century Market shortly after 10 o'clock this morning, killing one police officer and making off with several thousand dollars in cash. The slain officer has been identified as 37 year old, Gregory Michaels. Officer Michaels, a lifelong resident of Vernonia, has been with the local police department for 13 years. Law enforcement agencies from neighboring communities are on their way to the Vernonia area at this hour to help in the search and local residents have reportedly begun search efforts as well. The two suspects, both in their mid20s, were last seen driving a 1970 black Thunderbird with license number KSC045. Both of the robbery suspects were wearing ski masks and were armed with what appeared to be 45 caliber automatics. Witnesses at the scene report that the bandits appeared to be either intoxicated or high and therefore should be considered extremely dangerous. In other news today We showed them, huh? [laughing] Yeah. [dramatic music] [fire rumbling] Attention everyone on the search. John Baker's been killed. His car is on fire on the north side of the highway. He never got out. [ominous beat music] Woo! [laughing] We still have about four miles to the other car. Yeah, well getting there is one thing. Getting it started is another. My brother worked the engine over pretty good. That's what worries me. [ominous beat music] Damn! [tires screeching] [gunshots booming] What're these guys, crazy? Get us out of here, hurry! [glass shattering] [gunshots booming] There, right there! Make a right! Right here! [suspenseful beat music] [splashing] We blasted hell on that car but I don't know whether we hit them or not. Well don't kill them. They're not going anywhere. Oh, I aint gonna kill 'em. I'm just gonna wing 'em a little. [suspenseful beat music] I think we lost them. [sighing] [Link] That's gotta be one of them. [Bike] Oh, man. [suspenseful beat music] For everyone monitoring the action, the suspects have just turned on Johnson Road. Johnson Road! [suspenseful beat music] [Bike] Slow down a little bit. Here, I'll take this country guy out. [glass shattering] [booming] Bill, you all right up there? Yeah. I just got a little too close. Well, back off some. They're not going anywhere. [suspenseful beat music] [gunshots booming] Woo hoo! Yeah! [laughing] I'm gonna get this guy if it's the last thing I do. [suspenseful beat music] [Bike] Wow, man! Keep going! Go for it! [gunshots booming] [gunshots booming] They're not stopping! [Bike] Woo hoo! [thudding] [booming] [fire rumbling] Bill, over here!

[fire rumbling] [laughing] What? What's so funny? Stop it, man. Hey, stop it! Stop it! [smacking] Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry man. Hey, it's okay. I feel better now. Forget about it. All right, man. [thudding] [coughing] Listen! Don't you ever, ever, do anything like that again! Wait! Wait, listen! [ominous music] Hey, they're back again! Come on, let's get out! [gunshots booming] [gunshots booming] [suspenseful music] Wanna go after them? No, let's use our head. Hold it! I'll drive around to the other side, you cut a cross further down. [suspenseful music] Bill, from what we've been able to find out, they are somewhere down towards the river. Yeah! Right! The F4 Area. Sorta like Fowler Mountain. So they've got to come out to the road somewhere around that stretch. So you want us to hike up in there or what? No, George, you'll be shooting one another if you do! Just wait for them to come out! Okay. Fine. [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [gunshots booming] [Link] Well, do you see him? [Bike] No. Come on! [suspenseful music] What do you think? We don't have a choice. [gunshots booming] [gunshots booming] [whimpering] [booming] Go fish, daddy. Jeez, that Herm must be blind as a bat. I sure hope he knows the difference between a deer and a cow. [gunshot booming] [gasping] Please! Please, there's some men out there trying to kill us. Well we better get them some help then. Ah. Now I understand. Well just don't try and understand too much. Just sit down and keep quiet. Look, we don't want any trouble. We just wanna get out of here as fast as we can. [whistling] Hey, over here! You see me? Over here! Yeah. Thank goodness you're okay. I heard the shooting. Thanks, Hank. You recognize that house? Oh sure, Barney and I go fishing together all the time. Our guys are inside that house. Damn. Yeah, it's bad. So what do we do now?

We just can't go waltzing out of here, that's for sure. We gotta use our heads. So what do you have in mind? There aint no way we're getting out of here on our own. We got hostages now. [ominous music] I'm gonna have to tie you up. You got any rope? You can either make this hard or easy! We killed five people already. In the kitchen drawer, left of the sink. [ominous music] [rustling] [dramatic music] [engine rumbling] They're inside the Jenkins' place. That's all we know so far. Ben's over there watching the back of the house right now. The Jenkins home now? Their car is there. Go watch the front driveway. I'll go get more help. Okay. Hey, Hank! Stay low. Don't let them see you. Attention everyone on the search! Our two guys are hold up in the Jenkins house on Deep Creek Road. And we need everyone up her right away. Oh, by the way, I need someone to get on the phone and find out what's keeping State Police.

Check it out, we gotta get out of here before half the country shows up. [groaning] Oh man, one guy's packing a canon. Their car's about a hundred feet away. We got two guys by he road. There's a pickup right in the middle of the driveway. Well, the kid's coming with us. No, take me instead! You're getting to be a real pain, you know that? Come on, we don't have time for this.

The girl dies! [ominous music] Now what're we gonna do? I don't know. [groaning] Back in the house. [foreboding music] Thank goodness for that. [whimpering] You! That's your last mistake! Here's the kid. Come on. [foreboding music] What's the matter, momma? I thought you were dead. [crying] [suspenseful music] All right, guys, you wanna set up around the back. Okay, just park on that side and just set around the back, over there, yeah. Follow him. Go. Come on, come on. Good, just follow him. [suspenseful music] [Link] Oh, look at that. It's a blasted army. Oh, jeez. Bike! Look at this! I count four of them so far. [suspenseful music] Oh, we're dead. [whimpering] We are dead. 12 of them. [whimpering] 12 of them. Listen, if anyone starts shooting, get down on the floor as fast as you can. Shut up over there. You in the house! Make it easy on yourself and come out because we're not gonna bargain with you. It doesn't make any difference to us if you come out standing up or lying down but you are coming out! [groaning] [glass shattering] [yelling] [gunshots booming] [suspenseful music] [gunfire commotion] Die! [gunfire commotion] [suspenseful music] [screaming] [gunshots booming] There aint no way we're getting out of here! [whimpering] [booming] 555. What're you doing? Calling a cab? [gunfire commotion] [clanking] [Bartender] What? Oh, hell. Hey, Vern, it's your brother again! [upbeat dance music] Don't shoot till I get back. What now? [Link] Hey, I got a serious problem here, okay? [Vern Recording] I heard on the radio that you guys got away but you wasted a cop. [Link Recording] Yeah, we wasted a cop but we didn't get away like they said. [Vern Recording] Where are you? [Link Recording] Some place called Fish Hawk Creak. We're completely surrounded in a big farmhouse. Guns everywhere. We need help and we need it now or we'll be dead within an hour. [Vern Recording] I'm listening. [Link Recording] I need a car and I need some dynamite. [Vern Recording] Dynamite? [Link Recording] Yeah, dynamite, grenades, whatever. And a helicopter. [Vern Recording] A helicopter? [Link Recording] There's no other way and bring that moron buddy of yours to throw the dynamite. We've gotta keep everyone away from the helicopter for about 30 seconds. That should be enough to set down, load up and get out. [upbeat radio music] That car looks pretty heavy but I bet it can move. Hey, man, this aint your car. Whoa, hey! Easy, easy. Have a nice day. Hey! Hey! [tires screeching] Hey! Hey, wait! Hey! Damn! They just stole my car! Did you see the look on that guy's face? "My car! My car!" What about the other dude I pulled a knife on? Yeah, man, that was great. [laughing] [upbeat music] [police siren alarming] Oh boy, now you've done it. Damn! [upbeat music] [police siren alarming] I can't out run him. Can you take him out? [gunshot booming] [police siren alarming] [gunshot booming] [suspenseful music] [police siren alarming] [gunshots booming] Move it! [rapid gunfire] Get in there! Back off or he's dead meat! Don't move. Get us out of here. I don't know how to fly this thing. [gun clicking] I guess I just earned my pilot's license. [suspenseful music] [Young Man] Come on, hurry up! Come on, get it moving! [engine buzzing] [whooshing] [suspenseful music] Where are we going? Fly west, I'll tell you when we get there. [sighing] Whatever you say. [humming tune] [sighing] Hey, man. Lay off that stuff. You know how you get when you're drinking. You just watch the window. Who died and made you boss? We're never gonna get out of here. [ominous music] [foreboding music] [glass shattering] [ominous music] [booming] [gunshots firing] [foreboding music] [laughing] [Link] Well, well, what have we here? Breaking and entering. That's a no, no. Plus, you shot at me and I hate that. I just drew blood for the good guys. Oh. [menacing music] [booming] [Link] Say good night. [Bike snickering] [dramatic music] [Vern] Put us down on the rock quarry. [foreboding music] [helicopter buzzing] Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Do you have permission to land that thing here? As a matter of fact, we do. Yes, I guess you do. Come on, move it. [ominous music] There it is. Well pick it up. Oh, right. Come on. [helicopter buzzing] You know, it's gonna be dark in a couple of hours. If they get out of there, we may lose them. Yeah, I know it. [police sirens alarming] [foreboding music] You guys go that way and we'll swing back around. Hank. Wes, how you doing? A lot of years since we worked together. Yes it has. It's been about 16 years since we worked together. So what have you heard so far? Greg died about 20 minutes. I'm sorry to hear that. We ran these guys in the state computer. Bad news. Essentially, they've been charged with everything from armed robbery, burglary, rape and arson. Of course never could prove much. But now we got the bastards. Do we? We've done everything but burn the place down and with the family in there, we can't do much. God help us if we hit one of them with all this shooting. All we can do for now is make them as uncomfortable as possible. We'll cut off their electricity so that the water pump doesn't work. No telephone. Sooner or later, their food's gonna have to run out. So what's the next step? What do we do now? The state police will be here any minute. We'll bring your cars around. But for now, we'll wait. And I got something in the trunk that will make a grown man cry. [ominous music] [groaning] [Bike] Hey, I told you to lay off that stuff, man. Hey, I'm sharp as a tack. [thudding] [Bike] Yeah right. Says I'm not sharp. [Bike] Hey, Link. Come on, man. Get in here and help me watch these people. Yo! Sharp as a tack. [Bike] Come on, man. You all right, buddy? Sharp as a tack. Sharp enough to know a golden opportunity when I see one. [menacing music] [Bike] Hey. Hey, man, why don't you leave her alone? [smacking] [whimpering] Haven't you caused enough pain already? Oh. Take a nap. [thudding] [Woman] No! Daddy. No! No! Come on. No! [woman whimpering] No! No! [crying] No! [crying] Lay down! No. [glass shattering] [suspenseful music] [Link coughing] [glass shattering] [coughing] [coughing] [Link] Cover the front! They're gonna rush us! [coughing] [suspenseful music] Get up, fat boy! Come on! Come on, let's go! Come on, move it! Come on! Come on, we're going upstairs! Everybody upstairs! Come one! [coughing] Come on, move it! [coughing] I can't breathe. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! [coughing] Come on! Watch them! Help me put this under the door. [suspenseful music] I said watch them! We'll put them in the closet. [Bike] All right, all right. They're coming in. [gunshots booming] Get in! By the wood pile. I see them. [gunfire commotion] [suspenseful music] Those upper windows are hard to hit. Give me some fire power! [gunfire commotion] [Bike groaning] [suspenseful music] [Young Man] Looks like he's going the same place we're going. [Vern] I doubt that my brother called 911. [police siren alarming] [bombs rumbling] Come on, get him! [Young Man] I need to get closer. [booming] [thudding] [fire rumbling] [gunfire commotion] [suspenseful music] [Vern] When we get there, put us down as close to the house as you can. Keep the motor revved up. Bub, you're gonna have to cover us with the dynamite. Keep those guys as far away from us as you can. [Bub] Got it. [whooshing] [booming] What the hell? [gunshots booming] [helicopter buzzing] [suspenseful music] [laughing] Let's go! [Vern] All right, Bub. Start flinging that dynamite. [gunshots booming] [bomb booming] [Bub] Yeah! [booming] [Bub laughing] Get them out, come on! [Mother] No! Don't take my baby! [screaming] [Jenkins] Take your dirty hands! [Bike] Shut up, fatso! [April] Mommy! Help! [crying] [booming] [suspenseful music] [booming] Hold it! Ceasefire! Ceasefire! [dramatic music] [bombs rumbling] [booming] [Bike] All right, you guys get in the back. I'll get in the front. Come on, hurry up! Let's get out of here! Woo! Woo hoo! [booming] Hurry! Get out of the way! [Hank] Come on! [Vern] Get in here. Come on, buddy, let's go! We're out of here. Happy to see you guys. Uh oh, trouble. [Bub] Come on, what's the problem? [Vern] I don't now. I think there's too much weight. [Bub] Well do something and do it quick! [Link] Come on! What do you mean, too much weight? Let's go! [Vern] I'm trying! [Bub] Let's move out! [Link] Come on, baby! Come on, baby! [Bike] Come on! Come on! Come on! [Vern] I can't control it! [Bub] Get us out of there! There's nothing I can do! It's not the weight. We're out of fuel. [Link] What do you mean, where out of fuel? Freeze! Throw out your weapon! [Bub] Don't shoot! Please, please! Don't shoot, we give up! We gotta get the girl out of the back. Come on out, April. [gun clicking] [gunshots firing] [ominous music] [Radio Reporter] The search for two armed bandits who robbed a grocery store in the city of Vernonia has been suspended. Local police have reported that the suspects were last seen crossing the interstate bridge into the state of Washington. Deputy Wes Philips of the Oregon State Police is quoted as saying that the case has now been handed over to the Washington State Police. [construction commotion] [dramatic music] [upbeat synthesizer music] [exciting music] [Narrator] The Vernonia Incident in all of its simplicity was just as complex and time consuming to produce as many high budget productions. [exciting music] The script took nearly a year to write and over nine months of planning before the first day of filming. [exciting music] Over 200 Vernonians auditioned for parts in the movie and 66 were selected. Some as extras, others with speaking parts. [exciting music] The technical crew was small by Hollywood standards. 13 all together with filming in 10 locations over a 12 day period. [exciting music] "Ring of Fire" was shot here in 1961 and now, 28 years later, "The Vernonia Incident." [Director] Action! [gunshots booming] Let's do it. [Narrator] Bike and Link, played by David Jackson and Shawn Stevens have come to town to rob the local supermarket. Hello. [Narrator] They will hit hard and fast. Their plan is to change there getaway car and to vanish on the back roads of rural Oregon. There is only one policeman in town and his nearest help is over an hour away. You wanna go fishing this weekend? I don't know if I can get away but I'll sure try. You don't wanna get skunked again. Yeah, sure. [Narrator] Our police car in the movie actually was a police care in Portland before it was purchased by our stunt coordinator, Gordon Allen. The same car was disguised to appear in three different scenes. [police siren alarming] The homemade light bar was also featured on this highway patrol car. One car has hubcaps, one doesn't. This version has a stripe added on the side. Magnetic signs are quickly added or removed. We acted as our own traffic cops with our own safety cones and walkietalkies for communication. [Director] Cut. [Narrator] Cars were allowed to come and go freely and onlookers were always welcome. [gunshot booming] Quite a few gunshots were fired during the robbery scenes. [booming] Needless to say, they were blanks and we used 22s to keep the noise lever down. [gunshots booming] The sound of the gunshots was added later. Our very first scene of the film was shot at 7AM and we had snow mixed with rain. Rain was a constant worry and the first piece of equipment set up was an umbrella to protect the camera. This camera has a long and colorful history. It was used by ABC News for over 25 years and was brought out of retirement especially for this project. Obviously, that's the end of the hat. [Narrator] Director Ray Etheridge was a cameraman at ABC for 13 years. 048! Everyone on the floor and nobody gets hurt! [Narrator] The store remains open during filming and we make several announcements over the store's PA system that the robbery is just a movie. [Director] Good, okay. Everybody just listen up! Pay attention! Don't all you people go deaf on me! Just do what you're told and you won't get wasted. [suspenseful music] [Link] You the manager? Real nice place you got here. Get over here! Come on, move it! Open the safe or I open your head! [Narrator] The camera is normally supported by a tripod but in this case it is handheld to increase the tension of the scene. [suspenseful music] Drop it! [Narrator] The money in this scene is real and we keep a close eye on it because it's ours. There's over three thousand dollars, all in one dollar bills. And for the next three weeks we will buy lunch for the crew and supplies all with one dollar bills. David enjoys playing a robber and at lunch I discover a distinctive bulge under his shirt He has brought his gun with him right into the restaurant. The first day he was given a plastic gun. The second day he brought his dad's 45 to work. [Link] This is easier than I thought. Freeze! [gunshots booming] [Link] Where'd he come from? [Director] Okay, cut, my frame was off. [Narrator] In a classic stroke of bad luck, the local cop, played by John Ragner, stumbles into the wrong place at the wrong time. He checks out a suspicious car and gets more than he bargains for. [gunshots booming] [Bike] Come on, start the care up! Let's go! [suspenseful music] Get back! [Bike] Say goodnight! Get back! [gunshot booming] [Bike] Come on, let's go! [tires screeching] [Narrator] Our special effects technician, Jim Gardner, prepares to shoot our cop, literally. A special package of movie blood is attached to John's chest. It will be detonated electrically by a device called a squib. The wires are stretched along the ground just out of camera range. [Jim] We want to take it under your shirt. [Narrator] John has never been shot before. Will it hurt? Say it twice and then a half a second later, touch it. [Narrator] A second seems like minutes. [Director] Okay, action. Get back! [gunshot booming] [Narrator] John goes down hard. [Director] Good. [Narrator] Did he hit his head? [Director] Okay, you can get up John. Only kidding. [laughing] Am I still alive? [Narrator] John's fine. But the character that he plays is not as lucky. He dies later in the movie. First on the scene is Don Jackson who takes off after our robbers, armed with determination and a CB radio. Soon, all of the roads out of town are blocked. Damn! [tires screeching] So the bad guys no sooner knock off the store then everybody on the entire planet is chasing them. So the entire movie involved car chases, explosions. [tires screeching] [Narrator] This time, the ammunition is real. What're these guys, crazy? [Narrator] But they are actually aiming at a tree trunk just off camera. [glass shattering] Bullet holes in windows are often made with special air rifles and skeleton pill filled with Vaseline. Here, Gordon does it the old fashioned way. [popping] [popping] [Gordon] Get out of the way! [popping] [Narrator] He loves his job. [Gordon] Yeah! Yeah, I love it! [Narrator] Have you ever wondered how you get a camera man, director, sound man, assistants, actors and lights all into one little car? This was how it was done. The camera could either be placed outside the passenger door or on the driver's side. The same Toyota car body was used over and over again. We merely changed actors and not the car. Here's the getaway car from the outside. And here's the Toyota on the truck. Here's Don's car from the outside. Here's the same Toyota that was used by the robbers. Before long, several other people join the chase. Floyd Ragner drives this old pickup truck. But wait, here's the Toyota again. Here's Bob Jackson in the wide shot. And here's the Toyota. Here's Ed Justice in the driveby and the back of the truck again. Allen Callaway also took the driver's seat. [suspenseful music] [police siren alarming] In this exciting chase sequence, the interiors of both cars were filmed on the back of that truck. [exciting music] Policeman Bruce Hepler gives a convincing performance because he actually has a background in law enforcement. And Columbia County Sheriff Brad Oviatt lands a part as well. [upbeat radio music] Crew members also had cameos. Stunt driver Gordon Allen and lighting technician Rob Wilson are working in this car wash. And associate producer Emma Etheridge even had a couple of lines to say. Hey, Joe. There's goes two if I ever seen it. [Narrator] A huge expense for the production was the helicopter at a cost of over 400 dollars per hour. [Director] Okay, go ahead, action. [Narrator] Several scenes were carefully planned so that all the helicopter footage could be filmed in one very long day. Pilot Greg Nutt has been a traffic reporter for ABC for many years and this is not his first movie. Greg appeared the in World War II epic, "Tora, Tora, Tora" and Greg's helicopter appears in the opening credits of a television series, "Magnum P.I." [suspenseful music] Move it! [gunshots booming] Get in there! Back off or he's dead meat! Don't move! Get us out of here! I don't know how to fly this thing. [gun clicking] I guess I just earned my pilot's license. [Narrator] Aerials were shot with a compact 16 millimeter Bolex camera. It's a windup model that does not require electricity. [suspenseful music] I'm a timber pilot by profession and now I'm acting in this movie and the helicopter scenes are extremely exciting. [helicopter buzzing] [Narrator] Scenes that only last a few seconds on screen often take hours and hours to shoot. [Crew Member] His the sled, boys, hit the sled! Come on! [Narrator] This roadblock ambush is one example. Cars will be crashed, exploded and burned all without injury. First the windows are removed to protect everyone from flying glass. [thudding] Cars are precisely placed for the crash. The idea is to crash the cars in one take. But the black care still has to be drivable because we still have to finish the movie. To ruin the car at this point would be a disaster. [Director] Action! [yelling] Gordon! [Narrator] Everything needs to be reset but no harm is done. If everybody just calms down, I'm sure we can get through this. [Narrator] Craig Dailey and Ed Dotter do a great job delivering their lines and now it's time for the crash. [Director] Okay, beautiful. [thudding] [Narrator] A perfect hit. My first real vacation in four years and I'm working the whole two weeks. And I love crashing the cars. [Narrator] To make the sequence more exciting, the cars will blowup on impact. Jim rigs the cars with a mixture of real dynamite, just enough to make noise, and a chemical fertilizer for smoke. Will the gas tanks explode? We don't know. Okay, Jim, here we go. Five, four, three, two, one. Blow it. [booming] [Narrator] A miniature rocket engine, used to propel model airplanes, is used to set off gasoline in the front seat. It fails to ignite, so we help it the old fashioned way. The second car is hauled to a site several miles away where there is a steeper embankment. We film it as it slides down into position. [booming] And a little more gas to help it along. Several pieces of dialogue and action must be filmed before the fires go out. After nearly six hours of filming, the finished sequence lasts less than two minutes. [suspenseful music] [Bike] Whoa, man, keep going! [gunshots booming] They're not stopping! Come down this way! [Bike] Woo hoo! [booming] [fire rumbling] Bill, over here! You guys okay? We're all right! Woo hoo! Yeah! [laughing] Get those guys! [gunshots booming] Woo! Yeah! [laughing] Let's go home. [gunshots booming] [Narrator] One detour too many brings us to a dead end road. The car will teeter on the edge of a cliff until we are ready to cut it loose. [yelling] Okay, roll second unit. [Radio Crew] Second unit rolling. Rolling shot! Okay, action. [Narrator] The ground is too soft to simply push it over. So we try bumper jacks. I hope that we remembered to start the cameras. [Link] I've got nothing at all! We're gonna hit! [Bike] What?! [thudding] [yelling] [ominous music] [Link] This is great, a dead end road. I don't believe this! Did your brother work on this car too? [ominous music] What else can possibly go wrong now? [thudding] You know what else can go wrong? What? The money bags. They're still in the car. What? [groaning] Five thousand dollars. You know how much partying I can do with five thousand dollars? [Narrator] In desperation, the bad guys head for a farm house where a family his held hostage. Bullets are flying. Blasting caps simulate bullets hitting the ground all around them. The actors must be careful not to step on them. Stepping on an exploding blasting cap could be disastrous. All right! [Narrator] A piece of shrapnel catches Shawn's face, dangerously close to his eye. [suspenseful music] Two different houses were used for the hostage scenes. One house was shown on the outside only and another one on the inside only. Through the magic of editing, it all looks like one house. Tear gas is fired into the house. They escape through this door which actually leads to a closet. This shot is the other house. [Link] I can't breathe. [coughing] Get out of the way. [Narrator] And now we're back again. Watch them! [Narrator] The house is surrounded by a lynch mob and when the shooting starts, it looks as if the house is being totally destroyed. [gunshots booming] [suspenseful music] [Director] Action! [Narrator] To achieve the special effects, sets are built out of plywood. Holes are drilled to simulate bullet holes and electrical squibs are placed on the rear side of the plywood to explode on cue. So what you do here is in the living room we're gonna have you crouch down and going from one side of the window to the other. And you've got to follow the door like that. You start to dial. Hence the line from Bike. He says, "What're you doing, calling a cab?" By this time you're so flustered, you think you might even drop the phone. I've already dropped by gun. [gunshots booming] [Narrator] It's hard to tell the real walls from the fake ones. [suspenseful music] [gunfire commotion] What're you doing? Calling a cab? [gunshots booming] [whimpering] [Narrator] David takes an explosion near his ear and his nearly deaf for the rest of the day. [ominous music] An intruder attempts to rescue the family but he is killed or his efforts. This time we load two squib charges. One for his back and one for his chest. What's gonna happen is I'm gonna have him from here up and he's gonna take like two steps. He's gonna run and he's gonna fall right down out of frame. So we won't have to cover the wires on the bottom. [gunshots booming] [ominous music] [laughing] [Link] Well, well, what have we here? Breaking and entering. That's a no, no. Plus, you shot at me and I hate that. [booming] Say goodnight. [laughing] [Director] Action. Three, two, one, zero. And cut! [ominous music] [police sirens alarming] [Narrator] Meanwhile, more help is on the way. But that hijacked helicopter is dropping sticks of dynamite. [police siren alarming] Eventually the helicopter hits its mark. [police siren alarming] Once again, Gordon gets behind the wheel. [Director] Action! [Narrator] That last explosion has to be timed just right. And Gordon needs just enough speed to gently roll it over. Not enough speed. And at it's third time at that. A home run. Damn Ford. That's all their good for, by the way. [suspenseful music] [Narrator] We crash Don Jackson's car while we're at it. One quick pass, nice and easy. The helicopter continues on to the farm house in an effort to rescue the bad guys from the bloodthirsty posse. They drop lots of dynamite and grenades. [booming] A total of 13 cars are crashed, burned... and blown up. Jim uses over 100 pounds of explosives, nearly a half mile of electric wire and many gallons of gasoline. [booming] [suspenseful music] The explosion is impressive. But the fire melts electrical wires causing the horn to sound and the starter to engage by itself. [car horn honking] Gordon's solution? Kill the power by killing the battery. [gunshot booming] Eventually... the car dies. We're equipped to put out our own fires and we all take turns on the hose. Finally, the last car and the last of the dynamite. We decided to have a little extra fun by using all of our remaining explosives on one big grand finale. Seven full sized sticks of dynamite. It is placed in a cast iron well casing to direct the explosion straight up. Reporter Brooks Burford is given the honor of setting it off. This is it. This is the big madre! [Narrator] We all move back just a little and the camera shoots from a safe distance. [Gordon] Fire in the hole! [booming] [Narrator] The crater is enormous. The well casing is mushroomed and nearly blew through the roof of the car. [suspenseful music] [booming] Over 700 individual scenes were filmed during our three weeks of production. Okay, hit the hose! [Narrator] And the final editing process took an addition month. "The Vernonia Incident" was dubbed into several different languages and was released world wide by Impulse Productions. [ominous music] Vernonia has been very good to me for a number of years and this is my opportunity, in a small way, to give something back to the people of Vernonia. [ominous music] [intense music]
