[steam hisses] [serene music] [man speaking foreign language] - Kaere. [victims scream] [woman speaks foreign language] [man speaks foreign language] [Joan gasps] - Lariza. Verb roots? - The monster isolated them. It's linking them to the concepts of giving, offering, sacrificing. - I started dreaming verb roots. The Etruscans dropped by and talked to me last night. I don't know if it was real or just the words you concoct. - I certainly wouldn't talk in Etruscan to you at night. - Mike? - You had a spat with Arthur, right? - Mm-hm. - Well, you know what Etruscan women did when they argued with their hubbies? They hopped in the sarcophagus with the first male they bumped into. 10 months. Aren't we buddies now? - You're not funny and you're pushing it. - No, pulling. Trying to pull you out of it. Hm, what a face. - Oh, not you too. It's enough with my father, he lives on another planet. Yeah, I've had it up to here with this damn exhibition. Arthur for nearly a month now, Dad chewing his nails, and now these dreams. They're driving me up the wall. - How about dinner tonight? Maybe all you need is a little distraction. No more verb roots, hm? - What are these? - [Mike] Just arrived. Curious, huh? - [Joan] That's Arthur's handwriting. - Mm-hm. He sent them over. He's doing some research around Volterra. [Joan gasps] [tense music] - No, no! Arthur, Arthur. - Joan. What's the matter? [Joan whimpers] [birds chirping] [speaking foreign language] - [Masaccio] Mr. Arthur! Time to eat! - [Arthur] You go on, Masaccio, I'm not hungry. [speaking foreign language] - I go, you stay. Let one get a bite from a snake. [serene flute music] - Watch out. [serene flute music] - Thank you. - Do not thank me. That snake would never have bitten you. You are not Italian? - American. I study the past, the Etruscans. - No, Rasenna. They were called Rasenna. - Yes, I know. You're interested in ancient cultures also? - Come, I show you something. [foreboding music] [Joan gasps] - Arthur. Arthur! Arthur. [bones crack] [Joan gasps] [Arthur shouts] [phone rings] - Hello? - Joan, it's Arthur. - Arthur! - Listen, I want you to-- - I was just taking a nap. I was dreaming about you. It was horrible. Where are you? Are you leaving today? - I'm not leaving, the crates are. They'll be ready for shipment tomorrow. I'm sorry if I woke you. - [Joan] Why aren't you coming home? Arthur? - I can't explain now, I made a fantastic discovery. I spoke to your father earlier. Tell him unless he sends the telex, the crates will stay here. - What are you talking about? - I'll explain everything later. Just tell him, no telex, no crates, he'll understand. - I'll do no such thing! Either you tell me what this is all about, or you can just go to he-- - [Arthur] I found a tomb in a cave, an enormous grotto. It's every archeologist's dream, untouched like Tutankhamun. The richest Etruscan tomb-- - Oh, Arthur. [serene flute music] There, there's a pit in the grotto. A pit with sulfur fumes coming out of it, and a tunnel off to one side. - Yes. How did you know? - I... I dreamt it in a nightmare. I was there in the grotto, and this ritual was taking place. [suspenseful music] [Arthur grunts] Arthur? Arthur, what's wrong? Arthur! Hello, are you there? Arthur, what's going on? [bones crack] [Arthur shouts] Arthur! Arthur, answer me! Arthur! [man speaks foreign language] [suspenseful music] [dog barks] [engines rumble] - A lunatic or a burglar. Even the Italian police, well, you read it yourself. They figure it's a burglar. Arthur was on the phone. I don't know, he turned and he saw the guy, and the guy killed him. Now what do you wanna go over there for? I talked to Heather Hall. She'll take charge of shipping the crates and all the formalities. - Dad, Arthur was expecting something from you. He told me that if you didn't send him a telex, he wasn't going to ship the crates. Why? - I hate to tell you this, but that guy married you for the foundation and my money. - How can you? He was a great archeologist. - You can be a great archeologist and still be a fink. Want a shot of brandy? - Dad, you still haven't told me what Arthur wanted. - He wanted $100,000 to dig up some tomb he found. Now look, Heather will be back at the end of the week, she'll fill you in on all the details. Now why don't you fly down to the ranch for the week and relax and forget about things? - Maybe later on when I come back from Italy. You know I couldn't be satisfied with Heather's field report. [plane engines roar] [Joan whimpers] - Joan. Calm down. - You really surprised me, coming along. Thanks. [serene music] [man speaking foreign language] Inspector, is it possible there was no one to come to his aid? - [Inspector] He was a guest of Contessa Volumna. The Contessa is well known here in Volterra. She has a very big house and lives alone, except for an old servant. - La Contessa is coming, please make yourself comfortable. - [Mike] Thanks. - Shall we? Both Danta and the Contessa heard Professor Barnard scream, but when they arrived in here, the killer was gone. - Good afternoon. [foreboding music] Mrs. Barnard? I am Maria Volumna. - This is Mike Grant. - Nice to meet you. Hello again. - How long had Arthur been your guest? - A week. Your husband first came here to consult some reference books in my library. - I see. Do you have any idea why he might have been killed? - I believe I asked the Contessa that already. - Thank you. I think it's a perfectly legitimate question for a wife to ask. Please sit. The doors and the windows were all locked, and here we are on the third floor. When Arthur screamed, Danta ran in here immediately. There was no one, and Arthur was already dead. We called the police right away, and they searched the entire house, thinking the murderer had hidden somewhere inside. - It seemed that he had to be here, but he was gone. - Maybe he didn't leave, and let's say didn't even hide. Maybe he helped you search the house. - Mrs. Barnard seems to be hinting that we may have killed him, Danta and I. - Senora, it would take enormous strength to kill a man in that way. And besides, why on Earth would the Contessa and her servant-- - Yes, apparently no one had any reason to kill my husband. Yet someone did. - Perhaps a thief or-- [knocking] - Come in! - La Senora Hull asked to see Senora Barnard. - Show her in. - Prego. - [Heather] Hello, Joan. I still can't believe it. Oh, Mike! - Hi, Heather. - Oh, I didn't know you'd come too. Contessa. How are you? - Hello. - [Joan] Tell me about the tomb. - What tomb? - Arthur was just telling me he'd found a new Etruscan Tomb when they killed him. - I knew nothing about it. Are you quite sure you understood correctly? I mean, we did all of our research together, Arthur and I. And Nick here. Ah, you know each other? - Hello. - Nick Forte, Joan Barnard. - Hi. - Nick was working as our driver and general gopher, besides protecting Arthur. - Who from? - Please. - Joan's father's idea. He said that, with the huge illegal trade in relics over here, we might run into a snag or two. - Arthur ran into worse than that. - Volterra people are whispering that the American was a desecrator of tombs, and was struck down by the curse of the lucomons. - How about you, Contessa? As a great fan of ancient Etruscan rites, what's your opinion? - The universe is far stranger than you imagine, than you could imagine. - My husband's belongings, his papers and personal effects, where are they? - We examined everything, but I don't-- - I'd like to see them. - Certainly, I'll have them sent to your hotel. - [Concierge] Welcome, Madam. Please. - The luggage, please. - Bellboy! - [Joan] Velathri. - [Heather] Etruscan for Volterra. - [Mike] Yeah, they had TH like us. - It's from theta. About the crates for the show. We have to fill out insurance papers. You wanna do it here, or can you come over to the shipper's? - Either way. But first I want to shower. - Better bring them over here. - [Heather] Anything you say, boss. - To the shipper's? - To the shipper's. [foreboding music] [speaking foreign language] - The jeweler. [knocking] Come in. Oh, Mike. - Mind if I come in? Or do you wanna rummage in peace? - There's nothing. - Well, what do you expect if the police have already gone through them? - Arthur was onto something big. I was hoping to find, I don't know. I guess we'll have to read all his notes. There could be something that's clear to us but meaningless to the police. Something camouflaged in his research, maybe. One thing I do know, he wanted Dad to send him money so he could excavate in secret. Hey, look at this. Five days before he died. - "There are twelve." - What 12, 12 what? - I think you're growing a fixation. Etruscan phrases, the tomb. - What 12? - How the hell should I know? - Hey, there were 12 Etruscan city-states, right? Weren't there 12? - Yeah. 12 cities governed the country. Together they formed the Dodecapolis. Magistrates of the Dodecapolis convened in case of dire emergency or to hear the lucomon's complaints. So what? Arthur knew damn well there were 12 city-states. He'd never write it down with two exclamation points. - Yeah, he knew better than anyone else. There are 12. [ominous music] [Joan sighs] 12 what? - Here you are, Senora. When I heard the professor was killed, I have a serious business. Our name is 200 years old. I never thought to kill the piece, but I didn't know how to... - You could have given it to the police. - [chuckles] I don't know. Look at it. [ominous music] Now you understand, Senora. It's very old, very valuable. Do you know the piece? - I've never seen it before, but I feel like it's mine. [foreboding music] - [chuckles] Not that I suspected the professor, god forbid, a famous archeologist. However, it is Etruscan. - Why two tails? - According to legend, it was a symbol of divinity. Your husband brought it to me to have a chain put on. I thought it was probably a gift for you. Even a scientist may have his weaknesses. - You thought he had stolen it for me? - No, no, stolen, god forbid. The owner of this pendant has been dead for at least 2,000 years. The professor, how can I say, found it. [speaking foreign language] - The necropolis is just over the hill. This may be a millstone, but what it's doing next to a temple is anyone's guess. - [Mike] Maybe the miller was a part-time priest. - [Heather] You know, ancient bread... [eerie flute music] [Heather chatting] - [Mike] That dais, the crater of Eophroneus, the one in the Metropolitan, that was found here, wasn't it? - [Heather] Yeah, but if the Monte Abaconea... Yeah, they could probably dig around here for centuries and never find it all. You know, farmers around the province of Lacciu are constantly plowing up new discoveries in their backyard. - Mrs. Barnard! - More. - I'm not getting any closer to the edge, Gianni, I'm telling you. - [Gianni] Vaveni, Vaveni, stay where you are. Okay, give me some action. Show me some legs. More angles. No, Hilda, fanny, fanny. Stephanie, squat, go on. Fanny, proceed. - Where'd she go? - She's down there. - [Gianni] Close it up, close it up, try to be reasonable. Okay? - I think you'd better get her back to New York. [Gianni chatters] Give him a hand. - Change? [camera shutter clicks] Face forwards again. - Excuse me. - Change. Hilda, squat. Could you move, please? - Oh yeah, I'm sorry. [eerie music] [foreboding music] [gasps] [man speaking foreign language] [Joan gasps] [tense music] Arthur! [Arthur shouts] Arthur! [Nick grunts] [Joan yelps] [Joan gasps] - Joan. Are you all right? What's the matter? - Want to cry. - Why? - I, I don't know. - No more tombs, not for today, huh? Come on. - [Joan] I keep having these strange visions. Worms and things. - [Mike] Well, this place does have atmosphere, but let's not overdo it. - [Heather] Well, don't you see anything? - [Gypsy] Watch out. Long shadows lie in your path. [Mike chuckles] - This make you see things a little better? - You betcha, Mister! Days of glory await you, and great happiness. - Thank you, I don't believe in that. - You do not believe, granter of gifts? - What did she call you? - The stone you have gathered here is a piece of your life. [eerie music] - [Joan] What? Who is it? - You will find other stones, and will come to know who, past and future. - Okay, that's enough, can't you see? She said she didn't want you to. - I have already received more than I deserve. - Help, help! There's a dead man over here! [people clamoring] [tense music] [woman whimpers] [serene flute music] [door creaks] - Welcome back, granter of gifts. - Who are you? Why do you call me that? A gypsy in Cerveteri called me that just before a man was killed. - [Aulos] I know nothing. I am only an old man. - Why granter of gifts? What does that mean? - It is written, know thyself. Eternity is made of cycles of life. Each cycle is a gift. My own was already at its end, but a man close to your heart gave me a little more time. - What man? - He who prolonged my cycle. He has already ended his own. It is not easy to understand the designs of the gods. - You mean Arthur, don't you? You know who killed him? - Tomorrow you will see the light. [tense drum music] - Got a mark. This is it. Damn it, it's the right mark. He must have marked the wrong crate! We'd better open them all up. - You got all night for that. - But it's got to be here! - Somebody stung you, Mulligan. I'm sorry. - Whatever it is, if you just give me time! - An old friendship deserves faith, two weeks' faith. [tense drum music] [lid crashes] [solemn music] - Don't worry. Come. Now we have to climb. But you will recognize the way. [serene flute music] [water dripping] - Where are we? - It is you who must lead me, immortal one. [steam hissing] - What's that noise? - The breathing of Charon. [water bubbling] - I know this place. This cavern. The vapors. It can't be just a coincidence. I dreamt about all this in New York. How could I? I've never been here before. I've never been to Italy. I've never been in Europe, never. Yet I... I feel like... It feels like I've come back. - The immortals always come back. - Stop playing mysterious. Why did you bring me here? What is this place, who are you? What does all this mean? - I did not know until I saw you. I've been waiting for you. I knew you would come, because I have no living sons or grandsons. I am the last, you understand? So I knew it was time. - Time for what? [foreboding music] - I do not know. Do not ask me. This is the place, but do not ask me what place. I do not know. - Give me the lamp. I'll see what place it is. - The light is yours. - In my dream, there was something... On this side. Like a big archway. Or an entrance. [Joan speaks foreign language] And Terran held the scorpion. [gasps] 12, there are 12. They were 12 crates. [Aulos screams] [suspenseful music] [Joan gasps] Help, help, Senor! The light went out! Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Senor! Where are you? Guide me with your voice! So I can find the right tunnel! [rats screeching] [Joan yelps] [bats shrieking] [Joan yelps] [Joan screams] [steam hisses] Where are you? [engine rumbles] No. No, no, no! Let me go! [screams] [jet engines roar] - [Mulligan] Taxi! - Where to? - Volterra. - Oh, that costs a lot of money. - Let me worry about that. Just get me there fast. [engine revs] - [Valet] Hello, sir. - [Mulligan] Good morning. - Mr. Mulligan. - I thought you were gonna meet me at the airport. Where's Joan? - That's why we didn't come. She left the hotel yesterday afternoon in a taxi, and nobody's seen her since. - Have you got a car? - Yeah, it's right there. Mike's already gone and talked to the police. - All right, give me the car. There's somebody I gotta see alone. Take care of the taxi and the bag, would you? - [Valet] Yes. - The crates arrive okay? Any breakage? - Not yet. - You sound as if you know where Joan might be. - Well now, maybe I do. - You know how the prince is. He is cautious. - That's not the word. Not if he thinks I had my daughter's husband killed just for-- - Not just for, but also for. - Yes, business is business, isn't it? Now I'd like to see my daughter. - Do you really think I know where she is? - I sure do. [bell rings] - Well, she's here, but only by accident. - Yes, Senora? - Bring the girl here. - Yes. [door closes] - Aren't they a little obvious? - They're legal. There's been a great revival of private enterprise over here, and that includes security forces. - Joan is all right, isn't she? - Well, she's a lot better than when we found her. - Dad! - It's all right, baby, I'm here. Everything's all right now. Was all this necessary with my daughter? - Oh, come off it. You're a drug pusher, and you-- - Yes, yes, I help smuggle drugs into the States, but I'm just a link in a chain. You can't always make the choices you want to in life. - You had Arthur killed because he found out what you-- - [Mulligan] No, Joan, I never had anyone killed. - "There are 12," that's what Arthur wrote in his diary. I couldn't figure out what it meant 'til I saw the other crate, and then it was all clear. Arthur found out there were 12 crates, not 11, and the 12th one was full of heroin. And that's why you had him killed! - Yes, 12 crates, because one was supposed to stay here, and the other with heroin in it was supposed to go in its place. Yes, Arthur stumbled on the drug traffic, how I don't know. But Arthur wasn't the only one to discover the heroin. Whoever else did hijacked it, then eliminated him. They had to kill Arthur, he was the one link that would have led me right to them. - I'd like to believe you, Dad, but the way he was killed, the way they were all killed. - Whoever murdered Arthur was creating a little theatrics to throw the police off the scent. Or do you really believe that 2,000 year old zombies go around killing people? - Your father is right, Joan. Or is there something you know that will make him wrong? - That crate is worth a fortune, honey. That's 300 pounds of pure heroin. 700 million dollars on the street. Talk about Etruscan treasures. - That's not money, that's death. - Yes, my death if I don't come up with that crate. You know where it is, Joan, you said so. You see, another great choice in life. Either you tell me where that crate is or you sign your father's death warrant. It's up to you. - The crate is in a cave. [gun cocks] [foreboding music] - [Volumna] This is the prison guard's. He says we may need it. - Very thoughtful of him. Sorry, honey. - Go on. [gun fires] [Joan yelps] [Volumna shouts in foreign language] - Bullets through window, the whole car is armored. Go! [suspenseful music] Yes. Yes, she's taking us there now. A cave, she says. - Tell him to send help or they'll kill us all. - Yes, please understand. Three men at the turnoff to Renccula. - Masaccio! You there? Hey, they're coming! I couldn't get rid of them, now they're after us. [foreboding music] Masaccio? [steam hisses] Who's that? Masaccio! You, what the hell do you want here? Who asked you to mix in? Why the... Very funny. Come on, Masaccio, cut it out. We gotta get that stuff out of here, and fast. Then you can take your share and do whatever the hell you want with it. [tense music] Masaccio, if you and your greasy friends are trying to pull a fast one, I swear I'll... Come on out. Stop fooling around, come on out! Masaccio! [Heather grunts] [bones crack] [Heather yelps] - [Volumna] I never knew there was a cave here, incredible. [Volumna coughs] - Wait, it could be dangerous. - [Bodyguard] Over here! [bodyguard coughs] - Oh no. No. He's the one who brought me here. [Joan sobs] - Contessa! Look! [group coughs] - Heather! - Why? - She said she knew nothing. - She must have been with Arthur when he hit on the 12th crate, and decided to make her own play. And since Arthur was an obstacle. [coughs] Damn sulfur. - She's been killed the same way Arthur was. - She never could have handled it by herself, but she picked the wrong partners. [tense music] - I don't think the prince will have much trouble solving that problem, and someone is going to pay dearly. [Joan speaks foreign language] [man coughs] - We'd better not waste time. Show us where the crate is before someone moves it again. - Sure, the crate, the money. Two people murdered right in front of you, three other people killed already. And all that the Contessa can think about is money. This, this is a sacred place. This grotto, these purifying vapors, sacred for thousands of years! And all you can think of is wealth. Then I answer you, Maria Volumna, walk thy path. - Why do you say those things? - Immortal Sartis, King Attis. King Redel, we, builders of towers. We Tiryns, we masters of iron. Sons of the hot bowels of the earth. Oh Charon, hear me! From the 7,000 tomes of Sardinia, thy children struck Baum! Oh keeper of the abyss, guardian of the eternal cycles! Oh Charon, hear my call! They have desecrated-- [Maria gasps] [gun fires] The nightmare. - No! - And desecrated the sacred womb of mother Earth! [man shouts] [gun fires] [Joan gasps] - Joan! - No! [guns firing] [man grunts] [man yelps] [man shouts] - Charon! Answer my plea! Bury the transgressors! [steam hisses] [explosions boom] [cave rumbles] [man shouts] [screams] [debris clatters] [steam hisses] [heart monitors beeping] [foreboding music] [men speaking foreign language] [breath hissing] - Ah, she's out of danger now. You better go get some rest or we'll have to reanimate you. - I want to see her. - No, she's still under anesthesia. We took a bullet out of her. It was right up against her heart, as if the pericardial had stopped it. [chuckles] Let's say it was incredible luck. Or a miracle, if you like. - Read, approved, and signed. [typewriter clicking] Are you finished? - Yes. - Sign here. - Poor Dad. - Now you can fly home. If we need to question any further, it can be done through our consulate in New York. Of course, if you should remember anything helpful, I'd be most curious to know why you were shooting at each other before the tremor hit. [chuckles] - Well, I'll help you all I can, because I've decided not to leave until I found out the truth. - [Mike] What's going on? - The trail is closed, landslides. - Well, we'll be very careful. - I'm sorry, but we cannot let you pass. This area's restricted. The tremor uncovered a big Etruscan tomb up on the hill. - You hear that? Arthur's tomb, I knew he'd never lie about something like that. Mike, I've got to see it, after all that's happened! - There's no chance we could-- - Sorry. - Listen, I'm the wife of... I was married to Arthur Barnard, the archeologist. You've probably heard of him. Please let us by, just for a look. - I am very sorry, Senora. You must go to the town hall in Volterra, and there ask for a pass. I'm sure they will give it to you. [gentle music] - Incredible. This is... Excuse me, but this is incredible. - Hey, hey. - I'm sorry, but her face. I'm so confused. My name is Paolo Domelli, I'm an archeologist. I'm studying the wall painting of a new Etruscan tomb. You may think it's silly, but there is a portrait there that looks exactly like her. Please accept my apologies. - Paolo. Paolo, we'd better be on our way. - Professor, look at the resemblance. - Oh. She could have been the model. [Paolo laughs] - I'm Arthur Barnard's widow. I would like to see the tomb, but I don't have a pass. Could you get us through? - Wait. A colleague of ours couldn't come today, and we have a permit for three people. I'm sure Professor Sorensen would be very happy to have you come along, if... - Mike, do you mind? - I hope you'll be so kind as to bring her back to the hotel afterwards. - Of course. - Have a nice time. - Thank you. - Professor. Don't get lost. - Mike. Mike! - You are the light. That's an Etruscan expression. - I know. [Sorensen chuckles] - [speaks foreign language] Extraordinary. Yeah. [suspenseful music] - [Paolo] Watch your head. [water bubbling] - Please, the light. [foreboding music] [men chat quietly] [gasps] [men chat quietly] - [Aulos] The immortals always come back. - It was yours. - See what I mean? - Kaere. - We are already trying to decipher it. You know, Etruscan is easy to read because the alphabet is derived from the Greek, but what the words mean is almost a total mystery. - I know. - To immortal Kaere. [Sorensen speaks foreign language] That could be dedicated. But you can read it better here. As far as we know, Kaere was the only female lucomon the Etruscans had. The lucomons, apart from being absolute rulers, believed themselves to be immortal, moving from one life cycle to another for all eternity. Right this moment, I'd have to say they were right. - "Dedicated to immortal Kaere. "Lucomon, granter of gifts. "Guardian of the sacred treasure at the eternal banquet." - Sacred treasure? Excuse me, but why did you say that? - Because that's what's written there. My husband was a great archeologist. [crickets chirping] - She swears up and down there's a crate there. I'm just curious. Anyway, we leave the car here and we follow this track to this fork, okay? From then on, it's up to you. Darling, come in. These are two friends who are going to help us find the you-know-what. They're professionals. - How do you do? I'm Gianni Andrucci. - How do you do? - We already met. I am the photographer who was with the girls in Cerveteri when your friend Mr. Forte was killed. You remember us? - I think so, yes. - So you are agreed? We prepare instruments and meet you at sunset at the turnoff to Renculla. - Okay, but the police? - No, don't worry, I'll get everything we need, hm? See you tomorrow. [tense music] - [Mike] Joan, aren't we better off leaving well enough alone? - I don't want the police to find that stuff. - [Gianni] Let's go. - Well? [rocks rumble] [Joan yelps] Let's hope the whole mountain doesn't cave in. - We've got to dig here. - You sure? - Yes. - [Gianni] Shouldn't be too much. - Okay, let's go to work, come on. Oh, you better wait by the pool. Someone come, you warn us. - All right. - [Gianni] Come on, come on. Ready? - Go! [engine rumbles] [engine whirs] - Give me the sections and the weld angle. And now we'll see what's on the other side. This is how we tell what's in a tomb without having to open it. - [Joan] Mike, over here. - My god. [Gianni chuckles] - Did you find anything? - [Joan] Did we ever? [tense music] - That seems to be it, all right. The seals have been broken. - They were when I first saw it. Just think, they're packed with-- - Well, getting buried shouldn't be the guide's risk. So as the client, I'll go, okay? Pass me the light. - Well? - It's empty. - That's not possible. Was this for the sake of the crowd? - Come take a look. [Joan grunts] - [Joan] Oh, oh no. [knocks] - Joan! [knocking] Joan? Joan! [knocking] Joan! - [Joan] Paolo, what are you doing out there? - I'm sorry, but the man at the desk didn't let me come up, so I came up. - Come on in. [door closes] Where's Mike, Mike? Mike? - I doubt he's here. The man told me he left, giving strict orders not to disturb you. - What's up? - Two things I thought were kind of important. One, Dr. Sorensen deciphered the inscription and you were 100% right. You know the one beneath your portrait? I mean, that painting of Kaere that resembles you. - [Joan] And second? - Second, that tomb had already been broken into. That is, unless the Etruscans smoked Naccionale. - What? - They found a cigarette butt in one of the vases. - Oh, come on. Somebody on the crew probably dropped it in there by mistake. - No, the tobacco was all moldy. Must have been inside that vase for at least a couple of months. Somebody definitely broke into that tomb. - If you're thinking of Arthur, forget it. He didn't smoke. - I'm not thinking of Arthur so much as the person who was with him. - You mean someone who smokes Naccionale could have... [phone buzzes] Hello? - Excuse me, Senora, [knocking] but a customs official is on his way up to see you. - Yes, he's already arrived. Thank you for warning me. - Senor Mike Grant? - No, I'm Paolo Domelli, a friend. I'm an archeologist. - [Officer] Senora Barnard? - Yes, what's happened? - [Officer] I'm afraid you have to come with us, Senora. - All right, where? - We found a crate with a government seal. One of those you shipped to New York about a month ago. - Okay, I'll get my coat. - For the show? They were all full of well-known pieces, each one numbered and cataloged. - It's in there. We found a hole in the wall. We lodged it in there, it was. Someone broke the seals and stole the relics. - There never were any relics in there. That, that's all I have to say. - According to the weigh-in, 11 crates left Rome and 11 crates reached New York. Senora Barnard, I think you have a great deal more to say. Please don't try my patience. What was inside this one? Oh dear. - What's wrong? [Joan screams] - Joan! [wind howls] [rocks clatter] [tense music] [Joan gasps] [Joan gasps] [Joan grunts] [Joan shouts] Joan! Joan. Joan. Come. Joan, you cut yourself. [wind howls] But... But there's no cut. Then where did all this blood come from? - Cold. - I have a blanket in the car, come on. - Mike was in it, too. I feel, I feel like my head is going to burst. What am I saying? Poor Mike. He just wanted to help me. - Calm down. - When he saw the crate, though, I mean saw it was empty, he wasn't surprised. Not at all. Like he already knew. - Were you alone? - No, there were two grave robbers that we hired. - You know their names? - One, one was a photographer called Andrucci. [foreboding music] - Andrucci's place, but they say he's not in. - [Joan] Well, the lights are on. - [Paolo] Okay, can't hurt to try. - [Joan] If he's our last link to Mike. - [Paolo] Keep your fingers crossed. [doorbell chimes] - [Gianni] Who the hell is calling at this time of night? - Friends. - [Gianni] Haven't had any. - Please, we'd like to talk to you. - Oh, Senora Barnard, it's you. Please, sorry, come in. You never know. Someone might get funny ideas into his... Let me show you the way. You caught me in the middle of a little work. I take pictures on the side. You know, to make a little extra. [Paolo laughs] Etruscans are in right now. Hilda, show the leg a little bit more. There, that's it. Julie, lean back. That's the angle, fine, hold it. Now remember those positions. Okay kids, go take a break while I talk to my friends here. There's beer in the fridge. Please. - Why didn't I think of setting Etruscans like that? - We do what we can, judging from some of the frescos. Up the stairs. They were pretty good at erotic art themselves. Make yourselves at home. Excuse the mess, you know how it is. Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? - Did you hear about Mike's death? - Yes. Senaldi just called me. - I don't drink, thank you. - [Paolo] Are these cigarettes yours? - [Gianni] Oh sure, go ahead. Ever go in there before? - [Paolo] Could be, my name is-- - [Joan] What is that? - A crystal. Obsidian, I think. It's not worth anything. - Black prism of King Lido. [foreboding music] Look, Joan. These are the so-called stones of life. The longer a person lived, the more important he became, the more stones he had in his tomb. They didn't just signify age. They must have had some, some other meaning. If these stones were in one tomb, its occupant must have been very important. Since you don't have any vase around here, where do you throw your butts? It doesn't take cello combs, Gianni. I found one of your butts in a vase in the tomb. Were you there with Professor Barnard? - That came from there. - Did you take it? - Professor Barnard wanted to excavate the tomb in secret. Masaccio called me because he couldn't manage it alone. I called Senaldi and Tonino, and we all went together. We left Tonino on guard outside while we broke in. - But there was only a two-four wall. Why did you need four men? - The professor said that wasn't the actual tomb, but just an antechamber to it, and that it could be the discovery of the century. Tutankhamun was nothing compared to this, he said. [foreboding music] [men chat excitedly] - There is a fortune in here, a fortune! - Remember, don't touch anything. I told you, don't touch anything! - [Gianni] It was the most beautiful example of Etruscan burial architecture I'd ever seen. Wall paintings, statues, vases. But when you are in the business, you think of beauty only in terms of money. The professor had said there would be an entrance to the main tomb, but we couldn't find anything. If there was, it was well-hidden. Then the professor got another idea. - Maybe the treasure of the Dodecapolis is here. - [Gianni] It was possible, of course, but tales have been told like that about every major find for centuries, and we didn't react, because right then, we were more interested in immediate results. [Arthur chatting] [Gianni gasps] [Gianni shouts] - [Senaldi] Help, help! - Let's get him outside! [Gianni screams] Help. - [Gianni] Later he said he was sure the treasure was there, that we just had to dig for it. - [Paolo] Did he tell you where to dig? - He didn't know himself. And in a way, someone made sure he never found out. And Masaccio, that turned him weird. He said that he'd already found a treasure, and just needed someone to sell it to. But he hadn't found anything. Nothing Etruscan, anyway. - What did Mike want that night we went into the grotto? He didn't just want that crate. - No, it was to find out who killed the professor and the others. He said that there was something down there, and he wanted to find it. I'll go downstairs and get some more. [tense music] - Why are you scared of touching it? - I'm not scared. It's like respect, I think. It's sacred, Paolo. It's sacred. [Joan breathes heavily] From Sartis, on great ships. Ships, did I say ships? You're right, they frighten me. Whenever I touch them, I feel dizzy. - Take it, Joan. - No, I don't want to. - Take it. - No. - Take it. It could help us to discover the truth. - No, Paolo, I can't. - Don't you want to know? - Andrucci knows, he could tell us. But he won't come back. - What? I'll go see. [Gianni gasps] - [Hilda] Gianni! Gianni! [Gianni chokes] Gianni, Gianni! - [Joan] He's downstairs! - [Hilda] Certainly cuts a low profile. Gianni, what do you want us to do? Can we get dressed? - [Joan] He went to get some wine. Isn't he there? - Nobody answers. You sick? - It's all right, thank you, I'm fine. - Joan? He's not in the kitchen. And the door is wide open. - If this is a joke, it stinks. - [Man] What's happening? - Gianni's playing games. Gianni! - [Paolo] He's disappeared. - You mean run? - I don't know. He's not here. - Why, what could he be scared of? - Of choking, of letting himself go, who knows? If he was working with Mike, he might... He might be one of the killers. - He was there in Cerveteri when they killed Nick Forte. Do you think Mike-- - I don't know anything. You're the one who was there. [water trickling] - [Joan] How did that happen? [Joan screams] [suspenseful music] - [Hilda] Gianni! - [Joan] What happened? - [Paolo] We've got to go to the grotto. - [Joan] Andrucci. - [Paolo] The gray tomb must be the entrance to something incredibly important. - Is that why you took the prism? - [Paolo] Maybe you have a power. Some kind of counter with that ancient world. In your hands, it could give us the key. - [Joan] You take it. - It'll be dawn before long. [foreboding music] - Its place was on the sphinx's head. - Joan. What are you doing? Joan, come back, you'll suffocate in there! Joan. [Paolo coughs] These gases are poisonous. Joan, what are you trying to do, kill yourself? [Paolo coughs] [water bubbling] Steps? [coughs] [ominous music] [steam hisses] [gasps] [Paolo gasps] [Paolo coughs violently] [dramatic music] - The one great power, the cosmic egg, the anti-universe, the white hole. - Joan. Where is the treasure? Joan! We're here. This is the place. [laughs] You found it! Now tell me where the treasure is. - The blind don't know that light exists. Showing it to such as them is pointless. They don't see it, Paolo. The treasure is there. There is the end and the beginning of time. There, matter is contrary, opposing. - Looks like a diamond. If it were, it'd be better than 1,000 colors. If we could... - Don't touch it, Paolo. Don't touch it! [Paolo grunts] - It's pushing me away! - Antimatter, antigravity! If you touch it, Paolo, you, if you touch it-- [crystal warbles] The crystal is surrounded by a void, protected by a force that is contrary to gravity and which pushes the air away. Otherwise it could not survive. It would have been destroyed at the beginning of time. Matter and antimatter could not coexist if it were not for gravity and antigravity. Only in this way can the universe be. - [Paolo] How long have you known these things? - It's like they were talking to me from inside. Let's get out of here. All this belongs to the immortals. - So you are the last of the immortals. Now tell me where the treasure is. The real thing this time! Otherwise, I've turned a lot of people's heads. I'll turn yours too, lucomon. - You're the killer, aren't you? - Yes. But I'm afraid I can't take all the credit. - Are you going to kill me? - If you really are immortal, you don't have anything to worry about. [Joan gasps] - I am guardian to the sacred treasure! - And if you don't tell me where I can find it, you're going to stay down here for the rest of eternity. - The eternal cycle is the greatest treasure of all! [Joan moans] [suspenseful music] [shouts] [Joan whimpers] Mike! Mike! - I'm sorry, Joan, but I should've known which side you were on. Paolo Domelli, you're under arrest for murder. - Wonderful, Mike, but I don't think so. [gun cocks] - Sulfur vapors do terrible things to guns. [gun clicks] [men grunt] [Joan gasps] [Joan gasps] [tense music] [Joan yelps] [men grunt] - [Joan] Leave him alone! Leave him alone! Let him go! [Joan grunts] [Joan yelps] - All right, bitch. [Joan yelps] Where is the treasure, or I'll kill the both of you. Where is the treasure? - [Joan] Charon, Charon! - Die. - Charon. - Die! [Joan gasps] [tense music] [man speaking foreign language] No. No. [Paolo grunts] [bones crack] [foreboding music] [coughs] - Joan! - Oh, Mike. [whimpers] Oh, Mike. [serene music] You studied Etruscan history solely to spy on my father? You should have told me you were with the narcotics bureau. By the way, you never told me how you found out that Paolo... - I'll show you. The prince you said your father and the Contessa mentioned turned out to be the Turkish poppy grower, and a dead end. Then Andrucci sold me some photos he'd taken in Cerveteri the day Nick Forte was killed. They showed somebody watching us from the mouth of a tomb entrance. The Italian police blew the shots up, big enough for us to identify him as Paolo. Recognize the glasses? - [Joan] Yeah. - You know, the one thing I still can't seem to grasp is how you managed to kill Paolo after he knocked me out. - I didn't kill him! And there were only the three of us down there, you, me and him. - Maybe you're a witch. - [sighs] I never know whether you're joking or not. - It's why you're in love with me. [uplifting music] Let's get married. - I'm not sure it's a good idea to marry a suspicious cop. - Well there's one thing you can do for him, shut up. [Joan chuckles]
