But I did not expect to lose all our kin. Our elders would not have approved, since we would have needed to keep three days of mourning, and wait another seven, another forty and another year. Therefore we decided to marry and to have it just once. - And you brought her here? - No, this is not ours. No. We slept three nights in the plastic before coming here. - In the plastic? - Yes. - What do you mean? - I had bought twenty meters of plastic for the paddies and I placed them on four stakes. That way we were protected from the rain. - The wedding suite, eh? - Yes. Then I went to my father's house to see if we could find something. I found a pot, a dish and two spoons among the debris. We washed it and we carried it to our refuge of plastic. Later I went to the bazaar to look for something to eat. Then I saw two rescue trucks in the highway. In one they distributed camping gear and in another tomatoes. But I wasn't lucky. I couldn't get any camping gear, although I did get some very good tomatoes. I carried them to our refuge and I washed them. I made a thorn and I strang them together. We roasted them, not too much nor too little, and we ate them. - A wedding banquet. - Yes. We thought that we should hurry to set up a home. The ones that hadn't died expected it that We should go on living and proceed to raise a family. Perhaps we will die in the next earthquake. - Don't you think so, sir? - You are right. Hosein, you forget this. And you fix your neck, calamity. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good morning, grandmother. - Hello, son. Do not touch anything. Feizollah and I have come to remove all the things. - How good you are. - Here I left him a pair of tomatoes. The Lord may bless you. Puya! Puya! He left a while ago. Where? - Over there, a while ago. - Go man. I believe that he is there. - I can get up and call him? - Yes, sure. - Hello. - Hello. - Is it him? - Yes. Puya! Puya! Puya! Puya! - Good-bye and thanks. - Good-bye. - Dad, you know whom I have seen? - Tell me. Someone wants to pass. Come on, hurry up! Oh, how heavy! Listen, take the car away from there! I have a lot to do. Who would think to leave it in the middle? Come. - Already, already. Dad. I tell you now? I tell you? I hope that he lets pass this gentleman. He's angry, and with reason. Well, he already is. Hello. Tell me. - I have seen the boy of the movie. - What movie? That of the boy, "Where is the Friend's House?" - Are you sure? - Yes, dad, sure. His back hurt him a lot and he had green eyes. It was him. - Mohammad Prays Parvaneh? - The same. Go. He looks much like the one in the photo. - Are you sure? - Yes. I have seen him from the front. And at half a meter. Then he went over there. He has grown enough. - Why didn't you speak to him? - He didn't give me time. Look! There he is. - You see him? - Seems like him, yes. You are Mohammad Reza, no? Get in. - You are well, Parvaneh? - Yes. Where did you go? What is that? A beak and a bag for the debris. Why? With the beaks we raise the debris. Your house also collapsed? - Eh? - Yes. Where was it? Down, in Poshteh. Behind the stores. You know something about the Ahmadpur? - I believe they live in Koker. - I know that already. I wanted to know how they were found. I don't know. Why? The road that goes to Koker is cut. - You have become a man. - We all grow, no? We all grow. How did you manage to save yourself? Tell me. We went to visit my aunt. Good, and then? - Go on. - You went to see the football? Yes. What teams played the night of the earthquake? Brazil and Scotland. You see, dad? I told you that that night played Brazil and Scotland. You were right. Please, continue. You tell me more things. Scotland scored a goal. I mean, about the earthquake, not the match. I remember that, suddenly, the earth started to shake. The house began to tremble and we all tried to run out. The walls fell, as soon as we got out. A lot of dust was raised and we could see nothing. They all ran and they shouted a lot. You can imagine, we were very frightened. The uncle had remained there. He was asleep and could't get out. And when we raised the debris he was already dead. - Don't you know anything of the Ahmadpurs? - The Ahmadpura are in Koker. I already know that they are in Koker. - This road goes to Koker? - Yes, it continues from behind of our stores. The following day, could you see the other match they showed - On television? - No, all was in ruins. Not even light was there. Your television was so broken that you no longer could see the program? - That's it. - What happened to it? The crystal screen was broken. The night of the earthquake, until what point did you see the match? Until Brazil scored a goal. What team do you think will win in the end? I believe Germany. - Then I say Brazil. - We'll see yet. - We bet something? - Alright. You are going to lose. What do we bet? - We bet a ball. - What kind of ball? A ping pong ball. A ping pong ball isn't worth anything. Better a football ball. I know that Brazil is going to win. I'm sure Germany wins. Oh yes? Them let's bet something better. What could we bet? Many things. A bicycle, a... you tell me. Some socks? Some socks aren't valuable enough for a bet. A notebook. A notebook with many pages. A notebook is not useful. This is Poshteh. And these are our stores. Then, where do I have to go to Koker? Over there. By the left you go to Koker. - You have water? - There is a spring there. Hello, girls. You can leave me a container for water? Yes, very well. That will serve. No, no. You fill it from there. The water is for the car. Thanks. Now I bring it. Puya, open the hood. Puya, Puya, open. Many thanks, girls. - From where do those people come? - From Poshteh. - To Poshteh one does not go that way? - Yes, but the bridge is broken. - Anybody from Poshteh? - The two of us. - Poshteh is in ruins? - Yes. Where do you live now? Right here. In the second store. And your house in Poshteh? Where was it? There, higher up in the mountains. At the side of that pine. That dark pine? No, the one that has the pine higher to the side. Yours, where was it? It is so collapsed that it cannot be seen. What? It cannot be seen. - In Poshteh? - Yes. - There were many dead persons there? - We don't know. I was at home of an uncle. And the house fell. - Someone died? - Yes, my uncle. You are not a sister of Mohammad Reza? - Yes. - You resemble him. I leave this here. Puya, don't go away, we may leave anytime. - It is well. - Tell me. Two died. Who? - A sister and a brother. - And how were you saved? Tell me, please. Tell me. You don't want to? If don't want to, don't tell. When the earthquake began, the house fell suddenly. A beam fell next to me. Another one here that almost hit me and another by the right. I remained there in the middle as in a cave. I wasn't hurt, but I was afraid a lot. It took a day before help arrived and, I do not know how, they removed me from down there. And your brothers? They died. Dad! What? What's going on? - Dad! Dad! - Careful, look carefully. - Dad, I want to stay here. - But what you are saying, son? They are putting up a television antenna. - Then a thing goes! - We go. We go. Run. Run. Please, come. With that antenna we will be able see the match Brazil-Argentina. - You are obsessed with football. - It will start soon. I want to stay to see it. Run along, I say yes. You rotate it a little more to the right. A little more. Thus. Now we can see better. Still there is a little snow. Good, you leave it thus. - You see it, dad? - I see it. - Then, we will stay? - No. I have to go to Koker. And I do not know what will be the delay. I want to see the match. I stay and you fetch me on your return. - But I cannot return around here. - I will have to return. There is not another road from Koker. I think I remember there was another road on the other side. - It is cut, too. - And if he remains, will you take care of him? As if he were my brother. Then I leave him in your hands, eh, Mohammad? - Well. - But carry yourself well. Don't worry. - We go. - See you. See you. Listen, girl. You give this to my son if he is cold. - I will return within an hour. - He is well. You can tell me when the match begins on television? - It is announced at seven o'clock. - And when will it finish? It will finish at nine if it begins at seven o'clock. I am not a football fan but my son stays while I go.. - To Koker and I have to collect him. - He wants to go to Koker now? - Yes. - With that car? - Yes. - Then I don't think that he can arrive.. Because there are three points which are very dangerous. - Don't I have more solutions. - You will see. - I will try it at least. - Very well. - Can I ask you something? - Yes. Given the situation that the earthquake caused so many victims, - you watch television? - The truth is that I, too, am of the mourners. I have lost my little sister and up to three nieces and nephews. But, what can we do? The World Cup is once every - Four years and the earthquake... - Every forty. - Every forty. - Yes, life goes on - Also, this is work of the Lord. - How long will it take to go to Koker? By car and in normal circumstances it would take you twenty minutes. - Now I don't know. - You are from Koker? I am from Koker and I am from this playe. I am a little from all parts. We see. You know this one? Yes, sure I know him. He's the son of Abdollah. He's one of those that were in the movie. A while ago, he and his - Brother went to the house. - Are you sure it was him? I know all the boys of this region very well. They came from the street market. they went directly to Koker and.. took a stove. Perhaps you reach them. At the most they will be.. At the other side of the mountain. I will see if I reach them. Good-bye. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - Can you take us to Juban? - I'm sorry, I don't go to Juban. - I go to Koker. - Can you take us to the crossing? To the crossing? Sure. Have you seen two boys with a stove? - We carry one. - So I see. - Two others I mean. - No. - Where do you come from? - From Emamzadeh. I mean from where have you been walking. From where the road begins. I understand. And where do you live? - In Juban. - Juban. - How many kilometers is it? - Up to some 3. - And you intend to walk 30 kilometers? - Not 30. 3 kilometers. I got you wrong. How man kilometers are there from Juban to Koker? Not many. Few. - Few, eh? - Yes. Where are you from? I was born in Emamzadeh, but he is from Juban. - So you are from Juban. - Yes. - And Juban is near Koker. - Yes. - Then you will know things about Koker. - I don't know anything of what happened in Koker. The following day of the earthquake, a relative carried us, running to Emamzadeh. And I don't know anything of Koker. Already. See if you know him. This boy is Babak Ahmadpur. - He was in a movie. - You saw the movie? I think so. I didn't see it entirely. I have seen it a little. Where did you see it? I saw it, when I got honors and my father took me to Teheran. That movie was shown in the Cine Kanun. It's certain. In what scene did you leave? What did you see of the movie? Yes, I was seated in the third row. Had my hands this way, and I needed two teeth ahead. - What's your name? - Yusef Berangi. Yusef Berangi. - And you do not know anything of the Ahmadpurs? - No, when they carried us, to Emamzadeh, my mother wasn't well. - Your voice is a little worn. - Yes, from shouting. You remained under the rubble? No, my brother was the one that remained down there. Would you tell me what happened? My brother and I slept in a room. My parents had left the house. The mosquitoes didn't let us sleep. As they stung me a lot I went out to my parents. And when my mother raised the screen the earthquake began. - Ah. And your brother remained inside. - Yes, under the rubble. - You were only barely saved. - Yes. Those mosquitoes saved your life. That's what my father says, but my mother is angry. Why? Above all because the mosquitoes had not stung Reza. That's right. He would have been saved. My father says that is the "willing" of the Lord. - How do you say? - "Willing". Not the "willing", the will. We have to get down here. - Already we have arrived at Juban, eh? - Yes, it's right there. Very well. Then right now unemployment. - There I will not bother. - Juban is down there. - Down there? - Yes, in the valley. To go to Koker should I continue this road or should I catch some bypass? You have to continue straight and to catch the first road to the left. There accelerate a lot because there is a very steep slope. Once up, past some curves, already you will see Koker. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - I hope, sir. You forget the photo. - Thanks. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. In the curve accelerate! I will push. Well, that was my house in the movie. That wasn't my real house. It wasn't even mine. Yes, this is mine truly. You can leave it there. In reality, this also belongs to the movie. - Dad, what is this? - An oven. They told me that if I wanted I could remain in this house and I told them, I wanted to. Unfortunately, the earthquake destroyed my real house, although I refuse to acknowledge it. I try to deceive myself. I lived with all my family in the rescue camps that you have seen next to the highway. Then I installed myself here and I try to make it habitable. - Dad, what is this? - A hearth to cook. After all, this house has survived, so it's real. Yes, that's right. The movie again has become reality, stops being fiction. All the doors of the house are closed. I am looking for a ladle to give your son a little water, but I cannot enter the house. Mr. Director, do you know where the ladle is? Miss Rabbi, where have you left the ladle? It is up there. Get up and give it to him, please. Excuse me, Miss Rabbi. - Take it. - Thanks. Where is his son? Didn't he ask for water? He should be around here. Sit down and let's have a chat. You have dirtied yourself again. How many times do I have to wash you? Wasn't it 5 minutes ago that I have washed you. How filthy you are, son. - Hello. - Hello. Good, there he is. Now try not to get dirty till the night. - This water can be drunk? - Sure. - It's of the spring. - Then why does it come out of - a pipe? - That's because we have put one in. Puya! Puya! - Puya! - I'm here! - Son, why don't you answer? - I'm here. Drinking a little.. - of the spring water. - And what happens with that of - Mr. Ruhi? - I don't want it, I'm no longer thirsty. Don't stray too far away, son. - You stay around here close. - Alright. - Hello. - Hello. Welcome home. You give me a little water. - You have gone to your uncle's house? - No, I went to collect gypsum and they entertained me too much. You haven't gone to see Uncle Reza? - He was not at home. - How come he was not at home - if he is sick. - Then he must be recovered already. Besides, the gypsum is more important. I am dying of thirst. - Go and bring that oil lamp. - Which one? The one in that window. Come on, hurry up. Very well. Bring it here, don't break it. Give it to me. You sit apart, you are full of dust. - And my socks? - I left them on the cornice. - Not those, the white ones. - Here I go. - Hurry up, I have to go. - Wait. Excuse me, madam, is this water drinkable? Yes, it is spring water. Drink, drink. - And why the pipe? - We have put in the pipe. Please, splash the water here. You splash it here, here, here. I am splashing it where you tell me. Why do you quarrel so much? Because I tell you to splash it here and you splash it there. Madam, that carpet weighs a lot and has a lot of dust. - How do you remove it? - What can I do? - You alone will not manage. - I don't have anyone. Don't you have husband or children? My husband is buried under the rubble and I don't have children. - And what about your neighbors? - Everyone has his own problems, that's the way it is. My back is very bad, if you could pull this out, I'd be very glad. Let's see. It's impossible. It hurts me, too. Not even I can move it. Try if you can unearth the teapot. With the carpet there's no way. I will dig up the teapot. May the Lord give you long life. Please, try not to dent it. I can't last three days without taking tea. Mash Khatun! Here I go! Yes. What? If you wait a little, Hosein will lend you a hand. Hosein is busy with his problems. I think he can't handle it. I will fix them myself. Don't worry, daughter. - Life is thus. - You are very tired, grandmother. And what do you want? I do things alone. Someone there will help you, no? There is nobody. My husband is dead. Nobody remains. Oh, sir! Have patience. I have it, I have it. Your teapot, grandmother. - And without dents. - Many thanks. - Oh, the happy back. - Thanks. - You are from here? - No. - You have come from Teheran? - Yes. They come from the city to spend the holidays. Why have you come at a moment like this? Amin, don't you see that it's rusty? How often do I have to tell you not touch anything without my permission? Besides you have broken it. You are clumsy. Oh, you are driving me crazy. You are always up to no good. There it goes. That's just what I needed! As if it were not enough with the earthquake. You sit down! The first that moves will have his ass beaten. Quiet there! - Mama! - Shut up! His house has remained well enough, no? Well, only apparently. It's full of cracks. A few cracks is nothing. Mr.. Ruhi's house is fine. - Which is his? - It's a very large blue house. It has a chimney, an enormous oven and also two faucets of water. One up and another down. That's the house of Ghadam-Ali Gholami. His house was saved, but they, who had gone to the festival, they are buried under the rubble. They didn't go to see the football match on television? No, I don't believe that he liked football. - You give me that. - I don't want to, it's mine. - Give it to me! - I don't want to. Fool, you have painted to me. You are lucky not to lose your children. Well, these three that stayed with me were saved. But the eldest who stayed at my father's home, died. Thus the Lord wanted him. The Lord does like to kill his servants. If He has not killed them, who has? Therefore, the earthquake has. Poor daughter. She was very good student. The earthquake is like a wolf a hungry one that kills everyone who crosses his road. And on the other hand he does nothing to the ones he doesn't see, because they have had the luck not to go his way. It's the earthquake. He kills her. Your daughter has been lucky to die. Thus she has been liberated from the school duties. I suppose that you've once heard the story of Abraham, who went to sacrifice his son with a knife because his God had commanded it. When Abraham raised the knife with the intention to slay him, as God commanded, when he was on the verge of plunging the knife, the angels brought a lamb and they said: "You sacrifice it in his place." Already you will ask me how the Lord can kill your daughter, when she was beginning to live. I believe that if the people die, and then resurrect, they will appreciate life better. And also I believe that all the children that have survived, will appreciate life more. And they will be better and they will want you.. A lot more. Where did you learn all those things? Half of it from the history books. Another half Of Mr. Ruhi and the other half is mine. - Puya! Puya! - I'm here! - What you are doing? - I am speaking with a lady. You come out so that I can see you. - With whom were you speaking? - With me, sir. Don't worry. - Very well. You can stay. - Thanks. - Where have you put my socks? - I don't know. I have not kept them. If you had done so they would be in their place, as usual. Look if you have left them inside your shoes. I don't think they are in the shoes. What disorder! - You have found them? - Yes, yes. - You seem recently married. - We are. - For how long? - Five days. - Five days or months? - Not months. Five days. The night of the earthquake? It was a day after the earthquake. Eh! Why do you throw water? Excuse me, I'm watering the flowers. Wife, you have wet this gentleman. He will think that we do not have any consideration for outsiders. As I told you I was watering the flowers. Before you do, you should look down. Yes, I know, I know. - I can feel it. - Let's see if you'll remember. I think about the people that remain buried under the rubble. Two drops of water won't do me damage. Don't worry. There should not be many victims in your family, since you married the following day of the earthquake. On the contrary, many cousins, aunts and uncles died. In all, I lost some 65 relatives more or less. And despite that you married? Well, we had left the wedding ring in the house of my finac?e and we would have waited three or four days before we got married, at least until the trembling stopped. But I did not expect to lose all our kin. Our elders would not have approved, since we would have needed to keep three days of mourning, and wait another seven, another forty and another year. Therefore we decided to marry and to have it just once. - And you brought her here? - No, this is not ours. No. We slept three nights in the plastic before coming here. - In the plastic? - Yes. - What do you mean? - I had bought twenty meters of plastic for the paddies and I placed them on four stakes. That way we were protected from the rain. - The wedding suite, eh? - Yes. Then I went to my father's house to see if we could find something. I found a pot, a dish and two spoons among the debris. We washed it and we carried it to our refuge of plastic. Later I went to the bazaar to look for something to eat. Then I saw two rescue trucks in the highway. In one they distributed camping gear and in another tomatoes. But I wasn't lucky. I couldn't get any camping gear, although I did get some very good tomatoes. I carried them to our refuge and I washed them. I made a thorn and I strang them together. We roasted them, not too much nor too little, and we ate them. - A wedding banquet. - Yes. We thought that we should hurry to set up a home. The ones that hadn't died expected it that We should go on living and proceed to raise a family. Perhaps we will die in the next earthquake. - Don't you think so, sir? - You are right. Hosein, you forget this. And you fix your neck, calamity. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. - Good morning, grandmother. - Hello, son. Do not touch anything. Feizollah and I have come to remove all the things. - How good you are. - Here I left him a pair of tomatoes. The Lord may bless you. Puya! Puya! He left a while ago. Where? - Over there, a while ago. - Go man. I believe that he is there. - I can get up and call him? - Yes, sure. - Hello. - Hello. - Is it him? - Yes. Puya! Puya! Puya! Puya! - Good-bye and thanks. - Good-bye. - Dad, you know whom I have seen? - Tell me. Someone wants to pass. Come on, hurry up! Oh, how heavy! Listen, take the car away from there! I have a lot to do. Who would think to leave it in the middle? Come. - Already, already. Dad. I tell you now? I tell you? I hope that he lets pass this gentleman. He's angry, and with reason. Well, he already is. Hello. Tell me. - I have seen the boy of the movie. - What movie? That of the boy, "Where is the Friend's House?" - Are you sure? - Yes, dad, sure. His back hurt him a lot and he had green eyes. It was him. - Mohammad Prays Parvaneh? - The same. Go. He looks much like the one in the photo. - Are you sure? - Yes. I have seen him from the front. And at half a meter. Then he went over there. He has grown enough. - Why didn't you speak to him? - He didn't give me time. Look! There he is. - You see him? - Seems like him, yes. You are Mohammad Reza, no? Get in. - You are well, Parvaneh? - Yes. Where did you go? What is that? A beak and a bag for the debris. Why? With the beaks we raise the debris. Your house also collapsed? - Eh? - Yes. Where was it? Down, in Poshteh. Behind the stores. You know something about the Ahmadpur? - I believe they live in Koker. - I know that already. I wanted to know how they were found. I don't know. Why? The road that goes to Koker is cut. - You have become a man. - We all grow, no? We all grow. How did you manage to save yourself? Tell me. We went to visit my aunt. Good, and then? - Go on. - You went to see the football? Yes. What teams played the night of the earthquake? Brazil and Scotland. You see, dad? I told you that that night played Brazil and Scotland. You were right. Please, continue. You tell me more things. Scotland scored a goal. I mean, about the earthquake, not the match. I remember that, suddenly, the earth started to shake. The house began to tremble and we all tried to run out. The walls fell, as soon as we got out. A lot of dust was raised and we could see nothing. They all ran and they shouted a lot. You can imagine, we were very frightened. The uncle had remained there. He was asleep and could't get out.

I already know that they are in Koker. - This road goes to Koker? - Yes, it continues from behind of our stores. The following day, could you see the other match they showed - On television? - No, all was in ruins. Not even light was there. Your television was so broken that you no longer could see the program? - That's it. - What happened to it? The crystal screen was broken. The night of the earthquake, until what point did you see the match? Until Brazil scored a goal. What team do you think will win in the end? I believe Germany. - Then I say Brazil. - We'll see yet. - We bet something? - Alright. You are going to lose. What do we bet? - We bet a ball. - What kind of ball? A ping pong ball. A ping pong ball isn't worth anything. Better a football ball. I know that Brazil is going to win. I'm sure Germany wins. Oh yes? Them let's bet something better. What could we bet? Many things. A bicycle, a... you tell me. Some socks? Some socks aren't valuable enough for a bet. A notebook. A notebook with many pages. A notebook is not useful. This is Poshteh. And these are our stores. Then, where do I have to go to Koker? Over there. By the left you go to Koker. - You have water? - There is a spring there. Hello, girls. You can leave me a container for water? Yes, very well. That will serve. No, no. You fill it from there. The water is for the car. Thanks. Now I bring it. Puya, open the hood. Puya, Puya, open. Many thanks, girls. - From where do those people come? - From Poshteh. - To Poshteh one does not go that way? - Yes, but the bridge is broken. - Anybody from Poshteh? - The two of us. - Poshteh is in ruins? - Yes. Where do you live now? Right here. In the second store. And your house in Poshteh? Where was it? There, higher up in the mountains. At the side of that pine. That dark pine? No, the one that has the pine higher to the side. Yours, where was it? It is so collapsed that it cannot be seen. What?

Who? - A sister and a brother. - And how were you saved? Tell me, please. Tell me. You don't want to? If don't want to, don't tell. When the earthquake began, the house fell suddenly. A beam fell next to me. Another one here that almost hit me and another by the right. I remained there in the middle as in a cave. I wasn't hurt, but I was afraid a lot. It took a day before help arrived and, I do not know how, they removed me from down there. And your brothers? They died. Dad! What? What's going on? - Dad! Dad! - Careful, look carefully. - Dad, I want to stay here. - But what you are saying, son? They are putting up a television antenna. - Then a thing goes! - We go. We go. Run. Run. Please, come. With that antenna we will be able see the match Brazil-Argentina. - You are obsessed with football. - It will start soon. I want to stay to see it. Run along, I say yes. You rotate it a little more to the right. A little more. Thus. Now we can see better. Still there is a little snow. Good, you leave it thus. - You see it, dad? - I see it. - Then, we will stay? - No. I have to go to Koker. And I do not know what will be the delay. I want to see the match. I stay and you fetch me on your return. - But I cannot return around here. - I will have to return. There is not another road from Koker. I think I remember there was another road on the other side. - It is cut, too. - And if he remains, will you take care of him? As if he were my brother. Then I leave him in your hands, eh, Mohammad? - Well. - But carry yourself well. Don't worry. - We go. - See you. See you. Listen, girl. You give this to my son if he is cold. - I will return within an hour. - He is well. You can tell me when the match begins on television? - It is announced at seven o'clock. - And when will it finish? It will finish at nine if it begins at seven o'clock. I am not a football fan but my son stays while I go.. - To Koker and I have to collect him. - He wants to go to Koker now? - Yes. - With that car? - Yes. - Then I don't think that he can arrive.. Because there are three points which are very dangerous. - Don't I have more solutions. - You will see. - I will try it at least. - Very well. - Can I ask you something? - Yes. Given the situation that the earthquake caused so many victims, - you watch television? - The truth is that I, too, am of the mourners. I have lost my little sister and up to three nieces and nephews. But, what can we do? The World Cup is once every - Four years and the earthquake... - Every forty. - Every forty. - Yes, life goes on - Also, this is work of the Lord. - How long will it take to go to Koker? By car and in normal circumstances it would take you twenty minutes. - Now I don't know. - You are from Koker? I am from Koker and I am from this playe. I am a little from all parts. We see. You know this one? Yes, sure I know him. He's the son of Abdollah. He's one of those that were in the movie. A while ago, he and his - Brother went to the house. - Are you sure it was him? I know all the boys of this region very well. They came from the street market. they went directly to Koker and.. took a stove. Perhaps you reach them. At the most they will be.. At the other side of the mountain. I will see if I reach them. Good-bye. - Hello, sir. - Hello. - Can you take us to Juban? - I'm sorry, I don't go to Juban. - I go to Koker. - Can you take us to the crossing? To the crossing? Sure. Have you seen two boys with a stove? - We carry one. - So I see. - Two others I mean. - No. - Where do you come from? - From Emamzadeh. I mean from where have you been walking. From where the road begins. I understand. And where do you live? - In Juban. - Juban. - How many kilometers is it? - Up to some 3. - And you intend to walk 30 kilometers? - Not 30. 3 kilometers. I got you wrong. How man kilometers are there from Juban to Koker? Not many. Few. - Few, eh? - Yes. Where are you from? I was born in Emamzadeh, but he is from Juban. - So you are from Juban. - Yes. - And Juban is near Koker. - Yes. - Then you will know things about Koker. - I don't know anything of what happened in Koker. The following day of the earthquake, a relative carried us, running to Emamzadeh. And I don't know anything of Koker. Already. See if you know him. This boy is Babak Ahmadpur. - He was in a movie. - You saw the movie? I think so. I didn't see it entirely. I have seen it a little. Where did you see it? I saw it, when I got honors and my father took me to Teheran. That movie was shown in the Cine Kanun. It's certain. In what scene did you leave? What did you see of the movie? Yes, I was seated in the third row. Had my hands this way, and I needed two teeth ahead. - What's your name? - Yusef Berangi. Yusef Berangi. - And you do not know anything of the Ahmadpurs? - No, when they carried us, to Emamzadeh, my mother wasn't well. - Your voice is a little worn. - Yes, from shouting. You remained under the rubble? No, my brother was the one that remained down there. Would you tell me what happened? My brother and I slept in a room. My parents had left the house. The mosquitoes didn't let us sleep. As they stung me a lot I went out to my parents. And when my mother raised the screen the earthquake began. - Ah. And your brother remained inside. - Yes, under the rubble. - You were only barely saved. - Yes. Those mosquitoes saved your life. That's what my father says, but my mother is angry. Why? Above all because the mosquitoes had not stung Reza. That's right. He would have been saved. My father says that is the "willing" of the Lord. - How do you say? - "Willing". Not the "willing", the will. We have to get down here. - Already we have arrived at Juban, eh? - Yes, it's right there. Very well. Then right now unemployment. - There I will not bother. - Juban is down there. - Down there? - Yes, in the valley. To go to Koker should I continue this road or should I catch some bypass? You have to continue straight and to catch the first road to the left. There accelerate a lot because there is a very steep slope. Once up, past some curves, already you will see Koker. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - I hope, sir. You forget the photo. - Thanks. - Good-bye. - Good-bye. In the curve accelerate! I will push.
