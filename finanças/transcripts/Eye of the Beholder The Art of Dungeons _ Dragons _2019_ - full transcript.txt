Dungeons & Dragons is a game about imagination but imagination needs something to work off of. Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy role playing game and the artwork is fantastical artwork. The art and the game, you can't separate it. You have to look at both components working together. There is suddenly a beholder in front of you. "Well, what's a beholder?" "It's a really angry onion with eyes and teeth and 'tentacle-y' stalks." And then you show them this picture. You cannot have Dungeons & Dragons without the artwork that supplements it. The lack of defined border to Dungeons & Dragons and the art form that then kind of goes along with it, allows for an incredible creative outpouring and expression. You're developing and being part of a whole 'nother world. Heroines and villains and dragons and all these wild fantastic animals. I know my mother looked at me a couple of times like, "You're doing what?" D&Dwas a perfect fit for me. I got to not only draw it, but make stories about it and scare my friends. Monsters and fantasy fused with gaming? It's just-- How could you resist? Why wouldn't anybody be in love with this stuff. D&Dart is cool. It's stuff that takes you into a different world into a different idea of, like, how to think. It empowered my imagination. All the modules, all the adventures. Everything was important, but the art was the reason why I bought a book. When TSR and Dungeons & Dragons came about, yeah, you'd go to the mall-- Waldenbooks or something like that, and you'd go into the gaming department and, yeah, you'd just be like, "Wow look at this new book. This is-- The cover is awesome." You know, that artwork just filled part of that void that wasn't getting filled anywhere else. It was just incredible. Every time I would pick something up, I wanted to be a part of the game through the artwork. What TSR and their artists were able to do is epic. You know, it's funny, you walk into a bookstore now or you walk into-- really any store now, and you're gonna see fantasy art. You're gonna see a dragon or a monster or something. They're everywhere. D&D art was kind of the precursor to all that stuff. It laid the foundation for that all to build on. TheDungeons and Dragon brand actually went on to define an entire genre when art should look like. Here was this cohesive world that was envisioned by all these amazing artists that creates a groundwork for where we can grow our stories from. Where we can grow our myths from. Where we can grow our heroes from. These images are more than just a product. They're something beyond that. ♪ When my brother Dave was going to his gaming club to play, you know, the latest tank battles game, Dungeons & Dragons showed up and they started playing this and he came back and told me about it and just the idea of it thrilled me. I can still remember riding with my mom in the car to go pick Dave up from his gaming group and walking into their game room and seeing for the first time a table with people sitting around it with sheets in front of them with numbers on them and funny dice and a game master screen and a guy sitting behind that running the game. Dungeons & Dragonswas maybe six months old at the time. In the beginning we were asking miniaturists-- because that's what this game was aimed at and people with a sense of playing with a figure on the table etc, We were asking them to play in their minds. Up until that point there was absolutely nothing like it. We had board games, but there'd been nothing that was all about telling these stories, these fantasy adventure stories that we had in our heads. It came first. It was the first to tie rules and interactive play to dragons and sorcery. Gary Gygax added magic and something different happened. It opened up windows to creativity that previously, you know, they weren't windows waiting to be opened, they were blank walls. He knocked windows into them. Playing role playing games is-- it's almost like making a movie together. Everybody's contributing, whether it's the character or what path they take. So, I feel the art is just one more component of that. The artwork forDungeons & Dragons specifically in theMonster Manual and these types of things offers a concise look at what to expect from your foe or your friend and that unites players in a way that, I think, makes it a shared experience. InD&D you're all at a table together. You really do have to understand what you're seeing because you're all experiencing at the same time. You have to be seeing the same thing actually to even communicate about the game properly. Having a center rail so that everybody at least begins from the same point. As a DM you can go on for literally an hour describing one, like, epic monster that you're about to fight and yet seven people will have seven different ideas of what's going on. And you can try as hard as you can to, like, put the exact idea of what you're planning to put in front of your players, but sometimes it does take just like holding something up and showing, like, the magnitude of it. If the DM says, "Well, you see a monster and, uh, he's got, uh, ten horns around his head." "Well, do they go this way or do they go this way?" It might not matter, but it might impact your decision making in which spell you choose or which weapon or which side of the beast you want to attack him from. Sure, there's the-- the technical aspect of it, but for me, personally, as somebody who's a gamer, really good D&Dart sets a mood. It gives you ideas as a player that you might not have had otherwise. It's important because without it, the narrative is less interesting perhaps. I think our imagination is always going to be, you know, compelling, but this makes it so much more rich. You know, none of the scenes that any of the illustrators do are necessarily the ones that you're experiencing, but they are giving you the tools-- the mental tools, the imaginative tools, that you need to populate your own experience in your own world. I have an idea of the character that I want to play, but it's the art that fine tunes it and expounds my imagination to make me go even deeper into that character. The artist can come in and do that whole one picture is worth a thousand words and show so much more in a three-by-four-inch picture on a page then the designer can do in two pages of description. It shows you where you are. It shows you what you're doing. It shows you who you're fighting, where you're fighting, what you're fighting. The landscape, the time of day, the seasons where you're at, the land. You need visuals. You need pictures to be able to go, "You open up the door and this is what's inside. Your friend has something coating their armor and it's dissolving their insides. This is what it looks like." My goal was always to have art in the books that people would grab and flip up to go, "And thisis where you are." And people would go, "Holy crap." Great D&Dart is narrative. And what that means is it tells a story all within a single frame. It might be to try and, uh... give some narrative about a character. Like, for example, a warrior who might have trophy skulls hanging from his belt or something. So that there's something that you can look at that character and see that there's a history there. Then there's also ones that hopefully are more entertainment value. That often you will find on the cover of a module where you see the conflict in progress. I wanted to show things going good and bad at the same time. It's just how it goes when you're playingD&D. Someone might be having a really hard time over here, but your buddy's picking up the slack. You might win, you might lose. They wanted this epic scene of these adventurers lowering themselves down into this stone pit. I think the art direction for this didn't specify too much other than there's goblins at the bottom and a fighter and a sorcerer. Like they didn't say to add these disgusting, giant centipedes coming out of the gargoyle mouths, but I thought that would just be fun. Like, "Let's ratchet it up just a little bit more." It's not enough that this is going on. That's the core of what we as fantasy artists, I think, is... is so important is that we give the viewers these options. These Choose-Your-Own-Adventure images. The art, especially in those, like, smaller scenes, give you the sense that there is something bigger happening. That this is a moment in time that you're capturing in the lives of these characters, but there's always little bits and pieces that show that there is stuff that's going on around them, before them, after them. That there is a bigger world that you can find yourself in. For me it's that moment before things happen. It's that moment of time when things could go either way. So everything is like this boulder sitting on the top of a hill ready to be pushed off. That's kind of what Dungeons & Dragonsis about. It's about reading into things and figuring out the story for yourself. It's not relaying a story that's already done and telling you, "Well, this happened and then this happened and then this happened. Here's the scene where it happened." It's saying, "This happens... now what are you going to do about it?" When there's action, there's not much emotion 'cause action is something that happens. It's very spontaneous. There's no time for thinking. You got to react or die or win. One or the other. It's before an action or after an action where emotion is. And it's like-- there's a painting called Avalyne the Life Giver. In the foreground, it's a snowy scene and there's a tree, and at the base of the tree there is a fighter who's been laid out, clubbed. And there's a cleric preparing to heal him and then you see footprints off over the hill and in the distant treeline there's a giant towering above it with his club over his shoulder. And the storytelling in that is so... epic and intimate at the same time. My involvement in games right now is with the retro gaming community. So we're talking with people who are playing games as they were played in 1978, 1979. So they're looking to recreate that first love experience. And if you can go back in time and find an image... a good image, that really tells that story about that first love and that is that Trampier piece. When you go First Edition Dungeons & Dragons Players Handbook, he showed you D&D. I think the reason why it's effective is because this is where I wanna go. You know, I want to see this. I want to steal this jewel. I think, "What happened in that room?" Like, "What did those people kill? What is that on the altar? Why is that on the altar? Where did they come from? Where are they going? What happens when they take the eyeball out?" I think that cover has the most story wrapped up in that little picture. ♪ I think that D&Dart opened up a door that wasn't necessarily there before. I mean, sure, you had Frazetta, you had N.C. Wyeth, you had a few notable standouts, but, um... you really didn't have that full genre yet. Obviously, you know, imaginative imagery has been prevalent in art as long as there's been art. There there's never not been a time of fantasy. It just have had a different-- a different face over the years. The fantasy art that we know of today, as Contemporary Fantasy Art, goes back to the Medieval Renaissance period. The Baroque Era of art where you have visual representations of good versus evil. Where there's little demons creeping out under the bed next to the woman who's giving birth to a demon baby or, uh, you know, a nobleman who's slaying a dragon. It's an illustrator producing a product for a client to exact an emotional response from the audience. It's all fantasy art. When we talk about kind of Contemporary Fantasy or Imaginative Art really we're kind of starting late 1800's moving through the 19th century with things like the Romantics, the Pre-Raphaelites, some of the Victorian artists, the Edwardians, and then really you get a real flowering of illustration right around and shortly after the turn of the century which is often known as the Golden Age of Illustration. It's the artists like Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac, N.C. Wyeth. World War I. That's kind of the beginning of the decline of the Golden Age of Illustration. Particularly imaginative illustration because after World War I the public largely lost its appetite for light-hearted fantasy sorts of things. So at that point, that tradition kind of stalls and Frazetta picks it back up again. Frazetta's first Conancovers came out and I saw those and that was an epiphany moment. It's... I thought, "That's it. That's what I'm trying to find." Conan, giant snake coming in from between his legs looking at him. Conan, on top of a mountain of skulls, a woman in a slave dress wrapped around his leg. Conan-- and friends, in that big battle with all of the dead people underneath him and he's got, I think, a sword or axe or something and he's raising it like this and there's lightning. Frank's greatest strength is his ability to be dynamic. To produce movement and energy and suppressed energy and potential energy. It just put his paintings on an entirely different kind of category from what people were used to seeing. And it had a huge impact on the public, on the marketplace, on publishers, and on all of the artists who came after Frank. Here is a piece of mine that I did to get the job at TSR basically and it was my attempt at doing a Frank Frazetta piece. I thought I could draw like Frank Frazetta at age 19. - Eat your hearts out. - Prior to Dungeons & Dragons, fantasy was almost a non-element. The first fantasy I was ever really introduced to was when I bought the Ballantine Edition of The Hobbit and it had the Tolkien art in an oval on the cover with this weird looking tree and flamingos. I was very underwhelmed. I think in a lot of ways we took what we considered that birthplace of fantasy, literature, and brought it into D&D and then created this art form that took in all the archetypes. That male thing of just being the hero and charging in and maybe a woman that could kick butt and take names right there with you and just as tough as you were, it's like ultimate fantasy. I think once D&Dcame out and-- and we started painting the stuff, it sparked the imaginations of generations. It was primed for this. And suddenly it was this entire new audience that we could expose not only our art, but just the whole tradition of fantastical illustration to. As far as kind of a market place that the TSR artists were coming into when they're starting. You know, they're really kind of starting with-- with kind of a broad stroke. There really isn't, you know, an established thing at that point that everybody is expecting them to do. And, "Oh, yes." You know, "Fantasy art should look like this." At that point there really wasn't a "fantasy art should look like this." When TSR started they did all their own artwork. In the very early days, they were just using people like right out of high school or whatever. Just kids that they knew. Tracy Lesch or Greg Bell. I mean, these are people that are people that-- they were young, young, young, young high schoolers or just out of high school, you know? I grew up in a little town in Northern Illinois in the far, deep Chicago suburbs, that was about a one half-hour drive south of Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, which is where the Dungeon Hobby Shop was located. In those days, they were in a-- basically a converted house. On the lower floor was the Dungeon Hobby Shop and the upper floor was the offices of TSR. My first professionally published work is in Dragon Magazinenumber six 'cause we used to go up, say once a month, to the Dungeon Hobby Shop and see what was new and I would show them my drawings and they were interested. There were no rules. If we liked it we ran it. If I thought he was good and he sent me a bunch of Homeric Greek stuff, but I thought it was good I might write him and say, "Hey, how are you at medieval?" And encourage him to send me a few medieval-looking guys. And I found a few guys that way. So it was really just for people who love to do it and wanted to make something others could love to do as well. It feels like that, you know? And I think, at the same time, that's part of the charm. We would, you know, get these assignments generally from Gary and he'd say, "I want you to do this." And he'd make a little sketch or something on a piece of paper. And then we would do whatever it is he wanted done to make the monster whatever he did. The work was raw. The work was not really defined and a lot of times you'd look at the stuff and go, "I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at." So it left a lot of room for the imagination. Thought, "What is this rust monster? What is this weird thing?" Or, "What is that?" You know, "A gelatinous cube?" I think a gelatinous cube is fantastic. It's giving you information about the world. It's giving you permission to use your imagination. I was always fascinated with the black and white art in theMonster's Manual and the books. They were so... small and specific and they communicated so much. They fed so much of my imagination in these little, tiny drawings. And especially now with all these amazing, wicked, full-color murals ofDungeons & Dragons. I prefer that really simple way of communicating fantasy. So I think they looked at them like textbooks versus this visual guide to an imaginary world created by. You know, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson. The manuscript would just be type and then it would stop and there would be blank space and we'd be given that and say, "Okay, here's a blank space. Fill the hole." Sometimes we'd want the illustration to go between two columns. Sometimes it would be just in the column or we could get a half page at the bottom or we'd split it up into small one at the bottom, small one at the top. So we got to make that decision. If there were descriptions about something you had to go according to the description, but mostly it was, "Well, we need a picture of someone holding a staff. Make it fit." What I liked to do is... I didn't have a light table. So I used paper that I could see through and after I'd drawn something that I didn't quite like I would then put another sheet of paper over it and redraw it and make it the way I liked it. The good artists were just masters at that craft of creating fantastic black and white artwork. To create depth and volume with black and white. On and off, there or not. One piece that I really remember that amazed me was Jim Roslof's full-page drawing of Thor fromDeities & Demigods. He's like swinging his hammer and there's like mist or clouds or something all around him. And it has, you know, his style which has always been this sort of Celtic-influenced detailed yet abstract - kind of stuff. - Jim's artwork was-- first it was unique because he wasn't constricted by normal proportions. He liked to exaggerate. So he was able to stylize it more than just to make it realistic which is, obviously, what the fantasy was about. And Jim was already very good at being able to do foreshortening and make it impactful. This is one of my original Jim Rosloff's that I have. Most of the other artists that you kind of think about as great painters, Jim was a great black and white artist. I always felt that he was one of the more underrated artists, underappreciated artists at TSR. It's not like a super tight drawing, you know? It's very fluid. A lot of movement and feel through it. That's why he's one of my favorites. Dave Trampier-- Tramp, my buddy. I think he did as much to fantasy art as Frazetta did for heroic fantasy art. I think Tramp did for the rest of us gaming art. He said we get to have fun, we get to stick our tongue in our cheek and still not break the mold or the milieu. The wizard galloping down the street firing off the magic missile, you know? And it sort of sells you something about those sort of worlds. Those sort of fantasy worlds. They weren't Tolkien-esque in the sense of being really dark and grim, you know, there was a lightness in them. I would watch him draw things and I would just... "Oh, my God, he's so good because, you know, he'd, just miraculously, what would look like a little lump, suddenly turned into this wonderful thing. This is one of my favorite pieces which is The God of the Lizard Men. I wanted to do a drawing that was like a Dave Trampier drawing. That's who I was thinking of at the time and I think I did a pretty good job on doing something that kind of looked like something that Trampier would do. I think Dave Sutherland was probably actually the strongest technical artist in terms of being the best draftsman among the bunch from a kind of a traditional perspective. I'm thinking of things like thePaladin In Hell. That would be a perfectly fine and effective black and white illustration in 2018. You can read the Paladin in Hellillustration in lots of different ways. Is he some sort of like completely foolhardy, reckless guy who-- it's like some sort of suicide mission. He's going in there. It's a kamikaze attack. So what? He's gonna go down, but he's gonna take so many of these devils and demons with him. Or is there actually something like, "Wow, this guy must be so awesomely hard that he on his own could go into this environment and he's gonna somehow come out?" ♪ So when I got to TSR's art department, um, things had changed. They had gotten a lot more successful. There was a place called the Hotel Claire with a bar on the main street that I would go to and occasionally have a beer. The hotel was for sale and TSR was doing well enough. They bought the whole darn hotel, but then the place that used to be the bar on Main Street was the new Dungeon Hobby Shop and then upstairs, where the hotel was, were the TSR offices. It was an old building with like slanted floors and I thought it was really cool. Literally rooms where-- that were sagging that we didn't use 'cause we were afraid - they were going to cave in. - There was a false ceiling and, uh, I can't remember who it was, I think it was maybe Erol Otus was wandering around up there and he stepped on something he shouldn't have stepped on and his feet came down hanging out from the ceiling. We were on the third floor. It wasn't a very large office. We each had a drawing table. Um, and it was pretty spartan, but in the months to come we added several artists and moved to the second floor and that was a much larger space. It was never like we were in this isolated group or this isolated place. Our place was always, always had people coming through. A woman from the PR department comes by with this man and his two boys and the PR lady starts asking me questions about my educational background. She said, "So you finished high school and everything right?" I said,"Well, you know, I got out after a year-and-half 'cause I wanted to go to art school." She gave me a little frown and just, "Yeah, so you--you went to art school and you finished that right?" "Well, it was a three year course and after a year-and-a-half I got the job here." And she kind of like gave me a sneer and moved on. I found out later that what was happening is this guy's kids were not doing their schoolwork because they were playing too muchDungeons & Dragons. And I was supposed to be the voice of the importance of education. The culture at TSR was--was incredible in that it was very creative because, again, a lot of this-- nothing had existed before like this. So we were creating it all at the same time. TSR was just a wonderful place to be because it wasn't like a normal job because we were all doing something that we liked. And everybody was my friend. The only thing that was at all kind of corporate about it is there was a time clock. So you had to punch in and out and nobody liked that. It was very liberating to be in a position of where you were basically given carte blanche to do what you want to do if you got your work done. So some of us would come in and work regular business hours. There were several people that worked from home. There were several people that would go on these binges and put in 10, 12, uh, 14 hours in a row. I used to go to work and get there before anybody else. I used to jump on the dumpster, get onto the fire escape, and I would leave my window open to my office because I didn't have keys to the place. And I would let myself in and I'd be drawing before anybody else got there. I can't think of a better work environment that I could have been in. I had nothing to compare to it. It just seemed like... it was the only thing I ever knew. So it just seemed totally natural to me. We all talked amongst ourselves, joked amongst ourselves. We all got along even though some personnel would change up now and again, you know, most personalities clicked. So the artists kind of fed off each other. We were certainly pushing each other to do better and to do well and to come up with crazy ideas. That was a lot of fun hearing their ideas for creatures. I remember The Lost Shrine of Tamoachan when describing the Gibbering Mouther Jeff Leason would make a strange sound which was something like, "Bleee bleee bleee." So if we were doing a module, we would get a full understanding of the story and the importance of what illustrations were the most critical. And the subject matter would sometimes be, "We need this specific thing from you." But sometimes it would be a group of illustrations that needed to be done and we would divide them up. If it was like the Monster Manual, very often we were given, "Okay, here is the next ten monsters and it's in under the letter B." And then you'd finish them, and by the time you got back in, it was maybe some other people had done 'em and you now had collected from D into F. So, when you look at the Monster Manual you'll actually see that there is a series of illustrations that were done and then some other artist would pick them up and then they would do a series - and then the next person. - Through most of the time there I would just do anything at all. It was all great. I think the one time that I really, really had a strong preference was for the Cthulu mythos in Deities & Demigods. Deities & Demigods included several mythos. Some from fiction authors including Lovecraft, but as it turns out, TSR didn't actually have the rights to do some of those copyrighted materials. One of the genres that was removed from Deities & Demigods was the Cthulu mythos and, so, I was disappointed that more people weren't able to see it, but in a way it created a certain amount of buzz around it and so hopefully some people have sought it out. The assignments that I disliked the most were the maps. And the maps were very technical and they had to be very precise and there were other people that were better at it than I was. I said, "I don't care. I'll--I'll do maps." You know? That's the job. I love coming here and drawing anything, you know? I was starting to come up with all this different symbology for the maps. So, you know, if we needed a one-way secret door I had to come up with what a one-way secret door was gonna to look like. If I was gonna, you know, do a barred window, "Well, what's that gonna look like on a map? And then we had to start doing different levels and it's like, "Oh, well, now we got to deal with stairways going up and down or, what are you gonna do with that?" So a large part of what you see today is because, you know, I developed a lot of that. The Greyhawk Map. Now that was something to be reckoned with. It was so large. When that artwork was done, they had to go to Madison to find a camera big enough to take a photograph. And I almost had to fall on it in order to work. I mean it-- It was really unwieldy. All of these colors were done by pulling the color off of these sheets. Now they come apart and they peel off. It was a matter of laying down one thing of color and then taking an X-ACTO knife and moving... cutting it out and then pulling out what's not needed and then laying down another one. And these are the very ones I used. I had little tricks to make it less cumbersome. For instance--I can't believe I'm admitting this... I would write the names of the mountains really big. Can you see how I really put the--the lettering in here? Just think how many mountains I didn't have to do. Greyhawk really was, um, something that... changed my life. ♪ When TSR made their artistic shift in the early '80s and brought in The Four Horsemen so to speak, in relatively short order the artwork went from being illustrative ofD&D, the things in D&D, the world of D&D, what is D&D, you know? To being things in and of themselves. A lot of the folks in my generation, this is what they grew up with. This is, um, their, I guess, - uh, Picasso you know? - Those guys were my heroes. Jeff Easley, Clyde Caldwell, Larry Elmore, Keith Parkinson. That's gonna be '81 to about '88 is when you see these guys just dominating Dungeons & Dragonsartwork. Well, I was, uh, living in Massachusetts and working in a popcorn factory. I had met Larry Elmore through a mutual friend. Basically, I did a freelance piece for them and they called me up later and wanted... to hire me. I'd heard of Dungeons & Dragons, but I didn't know very much about it. So this guy said, "Well I'm going to submit some stuff to Dragon Magazine." Uh, "Why don't you submit some stuff too?" My dad was working in Chicago at a pinball company doing pinball backings. And he was a huge gamer. He's playingDungeons & Dragons First Edition and so he'd be flipping through and thinking, "I could do better than this. I can--I can do this. I should be painting this." Then he found out, they're just up in Lake Geneva. And to me that sounded like moving to Alaska. The first couple of times they offered me a job I turned it down and then... I ended up, uh... being flown out for an interview and... And I looked around at the place. It was like, "Look like a bunch of kids running the place." I only saw about three or four people older than me and Gary Gygax was one of them. So we just talked and they were telling me about TSR and, you know, it sounded pretty good. He drove up there and started talking to the art director and apparently missed a couple of big hints about coming on full time and left. Uh, and then when it clicked months later, uh, was fortunately able to still get a position. Finally the president of the company at that time was Kevin Bloom and he flew down here. Well, he finally said, "What do you make? How much money do you make a year?" I told him. He said, "I'll double it." I looked at him and said, "I guess you bought yourself an artist." When I first got to TSR they had just bought a large, new building over on Sheridan Springs Road where they had already moved all the execs and so forth out there. And we knew that they were eventually going to move us out there as soon as they made space available. We had a large room all to ourselves so it was a big bullpen-kind of area. And we stayed in that kind of environment for pretty much the rest of... of the history of TSR. Clyde Caldwell, Larry Elmore, Jeff Easley, Keith Parkinson each had a corner of the room. I tried to kind of make a barrier so that it would be hard for people to come and walk into my area and see what I was doing. It didn't work because they would just come around and walk around anyway. Then the floor was covered, covered in paint. And in fact Gail Gygax took us to visit TSR, the building, when we were at Gary Con a couple of years ago and we got to go in there and in the art room there's still paint on the floor. We'd be working in that big room together it'd be pretty quiet and then-- I know I did this several times, I'd break the silence and I'd say, "Can you believe..." You know I was 35 years old. I said, "I am 35 years old. I'm getting paid really good money to paint monsters and dragons." Everybody just sort of stops, says, "I can't believe it. This is unreal." Here's a picture of all of us back in TSR in the '80s when were all young men. I think they called themselves the Art Dogs. Uh, hard to beat that, right? Yeah I don't want to say it was like a big party all the time because we did have to sit down and do work, but it was--they kind of left us alone, you know? We had these killer dart games and the scary thing was when you come through the door to come into our department, you were right in the path of the dart board. The board was on this wall, we would stand over here throwing and you had to go through the doorway. So if someone came through really quick they could've easily got a dart in the side of their head. It almost happened a few times. So if anybody's got any... original TSR art and you see a little perfectly round hole, that's a dart hole. Well some people made the mistake of, uh, when they gave us art supplies they gave us this big box of gigantic rubber bands. I mean, they're like pieces of inner tube almost. So like you what do you do with a rubber band that size? You shoot it at somebody of course. I think it says so on the box. One day we had our little fight and Jeff Easley was not there and a rubber band went skipping across his oil painting and it left nice little mark across it, you know? It's like, "Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, no-- Jeff's painting! Oh, no! We've got to fix it. Somebody gotta fix it." So somebody goes over there and, you know, tweaks it around, and fixes Jeff's oil painting. And, yeah... I guess he never even noticed it, you know? ♪ So when Larry joins TSR, that was probably the next big step, right? Here's a guy who's gonna be doing big color pieces, oils or, you know, medium that they hadn't necessarily had before. And, so, to really scale up to be a mass market product-- which is what was the goal and what they ended up doing fantastically as it turned out, you needed to be able to compete with everything else on the shelves. And so that's what they had to do to get there. My favorite thing about Larry Elmore are his skies. Even if it's a stormy sky, it's just so-- like he went out and took a photograph of the most amazing sky that you've seen and he can just put that in any painting. Well, Larry Elmore just does some fantastical environments. His landscapes are just beautiful. The land, the environment is important. If it's snow, if it's mountains, if it's a desert, water. This is important to the game. And on top of that, I love painting landscapes. And he loves figure painting, and he loves story. When you look at his characters and they're wearing unique forms of armor and interesting weapons and tools that they're carrying or the barding on their horse is really fascinating. And then in the background is some landscape. You know, a castle, ruins, forest, but you see the depth of the world. I made these things. They hook over there, they hit this piece of wood here and they float right above your painting. So I use it to brace my hand on when I paint. This is how wide that board was when I got back in 1987. I worked at TSR, okay? So I've used this thing. And what I do, when I'm painting, I'll be painting and I'll clean off my brush or when I mix my paint I'll come up here and clean a little bit of the brush off. So all this paint here is made of little dabs of paint slowly built up. So that's how every painting I've done since '87 it's probably got some of that paint in here. Larry had this thing that he would sometimes, uh, sign under the name Jack Fred to some of his paintings when he felt like he didn't have time to do a good job. It was-- Came from a little thing he had with his kids. I would talk sorta funny and real country and I'd call myself Jack Fred. And it's like I wasn't very smart. And the kids would laugh and ask me questions. I'd answer 'em and it was just a game we'd play in the car a lot. I did a painting. It wasn't very good at all. I said, "I can't sign my name to this. This is not a real painting. It's, you know, it's more like a practice piece or something, a rough." So I thought, "I'm not signing my name to it." So I thought of Jack Fred. So some of the others of us-- Occasionally when we'd have to do something that was really kind of, not of the best quality would sign it Jack Fred. So occasionally you'll find a Jack Fred attributed among the credits in the TSR product line. His thing is always, "I didn't know what I was doing. I was just doing it and hoping it turned out cool and it was fun and people enjoyed it." And he never thought of it as the idea of... "I'm creating this image and this is gonna be the birth of something huge." This is probably the most highly-visible piece I ever did in my life and it's been seen all over the world. If I had known it was gonna be what it was when I painted it, it'd probably scared me to death and then I'd done something a lot worse. I sat down at my desk and did a big drawing it took me half a day probably. The whole party fighting a dragon and that drawing comes back rejected. No explanation. Just "No. We don't like it." I went to go see Gary. "You can't do that." Only special people can see him you know? "Well, he wants his cover done for his D&D? Then I'm gonna have to talk to him." And I told him I said, "What do you want?" I said, "I've turned in two or three things already and you don't like it." I said"So what are you wanting out of this cover?" He looked at me and sort of bent over and he said, "I want something that will reach out and grab ya like this." So I was sitting there like, "Well, okay, I get it. I understand." So I went back and drew this drawing relatively fast. And showed to him and he said "That's exactly what I want." It's not a horrible painting, but it's not the best painting I ever done. I think for the time and for the game and to reflect the action the young people wanted to see in the game, it did its job. I don't really remember ever seeing Jeff paint. Jeff was always looking at his canvas... And he'd rock like this, and he'd study it... and he'd study it... and he'd study it. You'd walk away and you'd get a cup of coffee and come back and he'd still be studying it. Then you'd go to work on your own piece for an hour and you'd come back and he'd still be studying it. You'd go, "What the he--." You'd go to the bathroom and you'd come back and it's half done. Jeff easily did not rely on photographic reference like Keith and Larry did. So when you look at a Jeff Easley piece you feel the energy-- the gestural energy--behind it. Out of all the artists-- staff artists that were doing it, Larry Elmore, Clyde Caldwell, Jeff's artwork made me feel like a kid again. When I saw Jeff Easley's art for the Monster Manual II, fighter facing off against a Hill Giant, that rocked my world. It kicked the stool out from under me and kicked me in the teeth. All of a sudden here's real art on the covers of theD&D books. With Jeff Easley it would be the dragons. He's kind of one of those where you can look at it and you know that it's a Jeff Easley dragon. Jeff's dragons are just friggin cool, man. I mean, look here, you've got one of Jeff Easley's incredible paintings of Verminaard and the dragon. The scales, the drooling, you know, mouth, the teeth. It's just, you know, it's just so much life and detail in it that it's amazing. Yeah, my holy grail I would say that, you know, I still don't believe I have it, is definitely Jeff Easley's Big Red Dragon painting. From what I understand the art direction that Jeff got is like, you know, "We want a dragon that's kind of in your face and whatnot." So you know that's kind of how I got introduced intoD&D. I think I have done one pen and ink drawing of a dragon before I got to TSR. I think the first one I ever painted was the firstMonster Manual of the dragon and the Pegasi. Probably a little overkill doing all the scales like that tightly and so forth. And then, you know, there's no horns or any kind of sweep back on the head here like I would certainly do nowadays. Well, luckily, with dragons being a mythological creature that there's no-- there is no way to do it wrong. It's, uh, you know, there's no--no dragon police that are gonna come in and tell you did it incorrectly. Well, as far as skeletons and painting undead and that sort of thing, that harkens back to my, you know, lifelong love of monsters and fantasy. I mean, I just-- I just I loved skulls when I was a kid much to my parents chagrin. Jeff Easley's undead are so cool because there's so much life in them. Zombie-like, living, they've got personality. And you don't want to mess with them. They're pretty frickin bad ass and, you know, they scare the crap out of you. They just have an intrinsic power to them I think. Jeff Easley's Magisterpainting is such an awesome Dungeons & Dragonspiece. I mean, you've got this wizard Magister who's raising these undead, you know? And you're just drawn in to the picture and you want to know, "Why? What's going on?" Jeff was the best-- the best at doing magic. Hands down, man. You just look at an Easley. When you see an Easley magician going at it, the magic, he just knew how to do that. And then Jim organized a lunchtime D&Dgame. I was playing a magic user. An elven magic user named Cragmar from the land beyond the mountain. One day after I just turned sixth level, we were in a situation where I thought it would be a cool thing to do to cast my new fireball I just got. Of course, if you read the rules you will find out that if it is thrown in a confined space like a dungeon, a small dungeon room, that it has to have a certain area to dissipate for your fellow characters can survive it. Keith says, "Jeff, are you sure you wanna do this?" - "Yeah." - He did everything he could do to prevent me from frying everybody, but I-- I persisted and managed to kill the entire party. That kind of ended the game. ♪ Clyde was definitely a perfectionist and very particular about getting everything exactly right. I never was really comfortable with people seeing my work before it was finished. I didn't mind showing it to people after it was finished, but I didn't like people seeing it in progress since--especially if I was having trouble with something or something didn't look good to me. Clyde would take how ever long it took to do a painting no matter what. If his world's come to an end or they threatened to shoot him he would just ignore them. Clyde would paint probably like a Flemish painter where there's a tremendous amount of precision and detail. He knew how to bring out the concrete shape of a form describing a sword, describing armor, and making you really understand the mechanics and the structure. His colors were so bright and vibrant Everything seemed blended so well. Clyde really just put together a very saturated presentation and I think that speaks to the energy that was the aesthetic that was desired in art in the '80s. Ravenloftwas one of my first assignments when I came to TSR. And I think it was just intended to be a one shot. Evidently it was a popular module. As time went on, they decided, "Well, let's do a whole campaign." You know, Ravenloft the game setting. I think what Clyde Caldwell really added to the D&Dlexicon is his sensuality for the character. Clyde painted all women sexy. If he painted a nun, if it was a module about a nun she'd have been the sexiest nun you ever saw. The female characters just always appealed to me more than the male characters even though I didn't mind painting male characters, either, but, actually, uh, TSR was pretty conservative about the female characters and they thought, you know, that their audience was 14-year-old boys. But for some reason they didn't think 14 year-old boys liked sexy women. She's a smooth, muscular, - but still weirdly... - Feminized. ...bodaciously endowed. Yeah, she's like an other-worldly creature because it doesn't make sense that she could even stand. I grew up with these artists who would draw women in these big-bosomed, like, little bikinis and I didn't think anything was wrong with it because there's nothing wrong with it. Occasionally I would get a little criticism for maybe not having someone in full armor and that sort of thing. It didn't cover a lot of vital areas. Mostly nipples, I guess, 'cause, I mean-- I was painting for a game that had magic. You didn't need armor for protection. You could protect yourself without it. I don't want armor. I want to have a wizard in a bikini, with, like, wrist cuffs and, you know, like a magical shield. Like I don't need armor. I have brain armor. Each of the artists did four paintings in the Dragonlancecycle. So when Clyde was doing, like, Goldmoon, I came into the art room and I saw Clyde's drawing and I burst into tears. At some point I decided I wanted to paint her with bare legs. She cried a while. She's looking at it and I said, "Margaret is something wrong?" She says, "Yes... this is not Goldmoon. Goldmoon is holy, she's not." I don't know what words she used. "She's not this." You know? After that, Goldmoon always had pants on in paintings. ♪ Of the group of artists that TSR brought in in the early '80s-- Easley, Elmore, Caldwell, Parkinson, I've had numerous people and numerous artists tell me that Keith Parkinson was actually the most influential. And I have also had numerous people argue with me that Keith Parkinson was the most accomplished painter of those four artists. And, in fact, I've had some of those four artists tell me that Keith Parkinson was the most accomplished painter. He died way too young um, and he was-- he was an amazing artist. He just picked up like gangbusters man. I mean he went at it and he had a voraciousness to him that he just wanted to learn, learn, learn, learn, learn and he did, man. He just-- by leaps and bounds. Everything he did looked better than the thing he did before. He got to learn from some-- I mean... Elmore, Easley, Caldwell. Like, getting to learn from those guys? That's pretty great. I was showing Keith. I said, "Look, if you have a hard time drawing an arm as a single, get a model. You know, as long as your model and you take a picture of it and look at it and draw it, I said, "It's yours." So what we're looking at here are a bunch of reference photos mostly from the 1980s that my dad and Larry Elmore and a bunch of other, kind of, TSR alum-- you'll see Diesel in a few of them, took to help prepare for their paintings. For this one we've got a paper towel roll being a flute. Over here we've got an X-Wingbeing a laser gun. Riding a park bench like a horse. Probably a lot of confused onlookers while they are doing this stuff. I think it's a great snapshot, literally, into the history of this that you don't really see - this side of it. - You could see that he obviously studied classical painters because he's able to bring this incredible, realistic world to a convincing presentation. He had this innate color sense. I don't think he could explain what he was doing with color. I kept thinking like, "I got a box of crayons. I only had eight crayons, you know?" Whereas Keith seemed like he had a box of 182 crayons. So my dad's take on color was that color isn't blue. It isn't red. It isn't green. It's a mixture of, you know, everything. So his palette, if you looked at it, would be, you know, glob of this glob of that, glob of that. And then just mush of whatever this was. It was referred to as the Parkinson Shit Brown usually because that's exactly what it looked like, but then when you put it up on the canvas, "Oh it's a tree. That's the color of bark." That is--I mean it worked. I think Keith Parkinson came from a place of storytelling. There was always a sense of story and narrative and everything that Keith painted. They're all action shots. They're all events transpiring. There is an action happening and this is a freeze frame of--of what's going on in that moment. And a great example of that would be, uh, Parkinson's What Do You Mean We're Lost? That has three draconians arguing in the snow with trees behind them and there's no road to be found anywhere. And they're all like-- It looks like a family pulled over on the side of the road during a car trip all just yelling at each other. It's popular with a lot of people, myself included, because I think it kind of shows these terrific, fantastical, fierce creatures in a situation that you wouldn't necessarily picture them being in. Which is lost in the snow and cold, uh, and just grumpy and angry about it. He had, first and foremost, probably a fantastic sense of humor. He loved to play practical jokes. I put all those paintings up on the wall and went home that night and when I came back in the next morning, all my paintings were turned upside down. I was gonna start painting and I looked over here, well, my palette was gone... my brushes were gone. Everything was gone! So I was totally exasperated and I just slumped back on my chair,. I looked up... All my stuff was on the ceiling. The phone was on there, there's my brushes. Everything was all on the ceiling. It's a pretty amazing feeling knowing and seeing the impact my dad has had on the industry, but, more specifically, individual artists. Every kid wants to hear his dad's awesome, right? But I've a lot of people coming up telling me, you know, as a grown adult that my dad was awesome and he's been gone 12 years now. And the fact that people are still saying that kind of stuff when nothing new has come out in over a decade, uh, that's--that's fantastic. And I think speaks to what he was able to do - with time that he had. - I think what the worst thing about it-- not only that he's missed, but the paintings he would have done... we'll never see because before he died he was doing some fantastic paintings and he was only going to get better. By the time you get into the mid-to-late '80s you really start to reach a point where, to an ever increasing number of people, when they think of fantasy art, fantasy imagery, they start to think of TSR. They start to think of D&D. People that don't even play D&D, you know, when you ask them, "What does fantasy art look like?" They'll point at Lord Soth's Charge even if they have no idea who Lord Soth is or anything about Dragonlance or anything about the world at all. In the case ofDragonlance I really had a sense that that was gonna be a big thing, you know, right from the start. The Art of the Dragonlance that's one of my very first art books I've got. As you can see that covers off, third page is almost coming off. It was well-worn, looked through hundreds of times, you know. I just loved studying the paintings. Here's Raistlin in his lab with all the potions and everything. Just beautiful piece. You got to know the characters. After a while you knew 'em. They might look exactly alike in each painting, but you knew who they were. So it gave you a familiarity. When they're the one on the book covers, module covers. They didn't impose hard deadlines on us. You know, they really let us paint on these until, you know, we were satisfied with them. So we were just really put everything we could into them. Dragonlance was really the thing that propelled specific style. So you had Dragonlance and Birthright and Dark Sun and Planescape and all that stuff. That's when we were really sitting down and making, uh, style guides or at least a cohesive look to a world. Normally what would happen is once the designer and the editor decide on what they want for their product, and, hopefully, at that point they have a storyboard enough where they know they need three quarter-page illustrations and two half-page illustrations and one full-page. They will come up with an art order or an art suggestion. And it is important that the art description is clear, uh, that it's-- creates a hierarchy for the artist to latch onto about what is important versus what is not important and to remember that you're basically getting one snapshot. Oftentimes I think the editors when they would describe a scene they wanted to see oftentimes I got the impression they were sometimes describing a five-minute movie trailer. "We've got this thief and they're jumping off this roof and they're bashing this guy as they are falling down to the thing and then they're tumbling over." And I'm like,"Guys, guys, guys. It's a single frame." I always actually liked it when I got difficult, and I still do like it when I get quite challenging briefs because that's part of the fun of being an illustrator really; it's about problem solving. Sometimes it was even frustratingly simple. Like, "I really wish you would have given me more information rather than having to make me guess." We had occasions where we didn't even really have art directors. You know, we were just kind of-- and we were kinda divvying. And they would give us a big batch of stuff and we were divvying up the jobs among ourselves. Each one of us got the, you know, we would roll dice - to see who got to pick first. - Clyde Caldwell wanted all the ones with chicks in them. He was the--wanted to be the woman painter. So he would fight over all those. So I guess it depended on how... how popular the piece-- the--the product line was, what the elements of the painting were, and if it had chicks in it. And then the stuff that we couldn't handle in-house we actually had to call freelancers ourselves and coordinate them and use them on the job and, you know, do all the dirty work that an art director would do also. And their Rolodex consisted of a four-foot square section of a top flat file for art was all stored and the top of that cabinet was Post-it Notes and three-by-five note cards and scraps of paper with artists names and numbers on them. I basically stood there while they were all working and just would call out a name and say, "Do we keep this guy?" And they'd say, "Yes." And then I'd make an index card and we started their actual Rolodex. So I took an existing module and pasted my artwork into the module and then made a print out. This being a smaller version of the actual print out and sent this to TSR back in September of 1992. A lot of it I would look at and send back to the artist with a nice, little letter saying, you know, "Thanks, but no thanks." And she's like, "We loved your stuff." And I'm like, "You loved my stuff?" I'm like, "But you sent a letter that said, you know, you didn't like it." And she's like "Well, you know, all you sent were like... floating images of monsters and people. Like, they weren't doing anything. They're just-- they were just standing there." There's a Medusa standing here doing nothing and a couple of knolls looking around also doing nothing." They liked the way I drew, but the artwork was clearly I was-- I was doing nothing. By the end of that year I was given my first assignment from TSR which was a huge box set called Dragon Mountain which I remember because Jennell Jaquays did this amazing painting of a red dragon on top of a mountain top. My most famous piece, Dragon Mountain, was done as a freelance piece. Around 1990 I had a sea change in the way I painted. Suddenly I went from painting in one manner to something that was more rich and colorful and vibrant and people at TSR noticed that. And suddenly I started getting more cover work from them. Both in the magazines and on, eventually, the products. Freelancers, they bring a vast amount of difference within the course of a product. And you can see a lot of really cool things with people having cool, new ideas about different things, but you still need a cohesive Art Direction in there in a way that you're gonna put the product forward. And, I think, that's something that Dungeons & Dragons has always been able to do. Make a product, make a product line, - and we identify it. - In the role of an art director on D&D, our biggest joke is we used to sit here and say your subtitle was "Art Director, Cat Wrangler" because... in reality your whole job was about trying to match up all these different opposing forces. So you had the R&D guys who had a vision of what the art books should be, look like and then you've got the brand guys and the marketing guys who all have this vision of how it's got to fit into the world from a marketing and business standpoint. And then you've got all the partners that you deal with who have to be able to communicate the art with so that they can use it for licensed products and stuff like that. And then you've got the artists themselves where you're trying to take the stuff that the guys in R&D want and meld that together with the brand and marketing stuff and create a piece of artwork that fulfills on all their needs, but is also very useful for the book, and, oh, yes by the way, makes the fans very happy. You went from generic fantasy setting to, uh, to suddenly having this myriad of worlds-- of different realms. You know, you had Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun. There's a distinct definitive feeling that's different between all of those. And that's all drawn from that creative team. From those creative forces behind it and that creative team chose the correct artists - to represent that. - I love finding... the perfect piece to give to the perfect artist. The first thing you have to decide is "What kind of worlds do you want?" Um... and define some goals and then you start, uh... working with artists that can execute on that and bring that vision to life. WithDark Sun they wanted to try something different. They wanted a strong look and feel to identify the world and to do that they decided to use one artist to establish that. Luckily, I had been spending a lot of my extra time doing my own paintings and these I had brought into TSR and put on the wall. One of the paintings I did was this muscular woman on a rock. It was Neeva with the wings and the mask and the top. Uh, little did I know that they were creating a new world called Dark Sun and they were looking for a completely unique look. They came in, saw that painting, and they just thought, "This is perfect." I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Dark Sunis Brom, you know? Without Brom there would be no Dark Sunsetting. It's interesting 'cause to this day I have people come up and say, "Dark Sun is why. Your art is why I bought this product. It's what got me into Dungeons & Dragons. Brom as a person was a goofball. I mean, he was always, always funny. Diesel, in particular, would have a Halloween party and all the creatives would try to outdo each other - with their costumes. - Brom came dressed as Jeff Easley. Complete with theTV Guide in his pocket. He had on this, you know, goofy, bald-head wig with the hair sticking out and glasses on. I thought he was like a clown or something. And I show up at the party. So he's as Satan and I'm as Jeff and it's kind of a Good Jeff Bad Jeff. I just wish I had known beforehand that he was going to do that I probably would've... uh, retaliated. A lot of times, because we did have, like, a particular artist for a particular world, they were really involved with the designer and the editor in the beginning. Especially for something like Planescape. When that came around, I mean, you really remember the artist being a big part of all that design right from the beginning. Planescape was just so different. It was not typical medieval fantasy. It was not a regular fantasy world. It was interplanar. The art was fresh. I--At this point... was more confident than I'd ever been with my illustration for TSR. So it was a chance, I felt, to really shine and rise to the occasion because the other thing they told me was "LikeDark Sun, you will be the only illustrator on these books. And at least for the first year as we launch the series, we want you to be the only artist for the core box set, for the monster book, and for the first couple of modules" I think that came out. This is one of the mercy killers. This would've been from the original campaign box setting. This is all designed from Dana Knutson's concept art that would have been done early on for the game. The lead game designer, Zeb Cook, um, he was the one who said, "Well, we want a kind of a medieval world, but..." He said, "We've got to make it different." And I was kind of like, "Well, you know, what do I do, you know, to make it different?" And all he said were the two words, "Make it spiky and bumpy." And that was it. This is called The Mortuary and these were portals that actually went to different planes. Kind of hidden back there, but they're there. And then I just came up with this creepy look with some of the spears and stuff sticking out. When everybody saw this one, this pretty much sold the line. They really wanted to go in this direction. We needed to come up with a logo for Planescape. And so I came up with this idea which is the gates and the bat wings and the owner, Lorraine Williams, actually liked this logo so much she thought it was actually too good for, uh, to be used on Planescape so she wanted it used on Ravenloft. So we switched it over to Ravenloftand I don't think it ever was used, but we had to come up with a new idea and that's where we used one of the faction symbols which was The Lady of Pain. I had done some faction symbols. These are these symbols for different clan groups and stuff and one of them was this woman's head with the blades coming out. She has this dead smile, the eyes are just, you know, they stare back at you. Very mysterious, very creepy. When we got to Planescape, there wasn't a lot of those classic monsters in Planescape. There were some secondary monsters that you might have seen in laterMonster Manuals, but none of the real, big, core monsters were there and I felt like I had the freedom to kind of go nuts. Tony almost added a level of aesthetic clutter is almost what I call it. You know, like little pouches, little knickknacks and things kind of like squirreled away on figures or on characters. And before that, you know, you'd get like... like a dwarf in a tunic with pants and with boots. Tony comes along and does his gnome with a candelabra headset, smoking a pipe with a crazy pouch and platform shoes and, like, all this bizarre, crazy idiosyncrasies that make those creatures more than creatures; they make them individuals and characters. Everything just worked. That's--That's-- That's one of the most wonderful feelings when you work on-- on a world and it-- it turns out the way you wanted it to only it turns out even better. I always think back on those years working on Planescape and I always smile because it was such a great time in my life. And those were great people. During my time at TSR, it was during Lorraine Williams' reign, so to speak. And she hired--or a lot of people working for her weren't gamers, who weren't familiar with industry, but they had backgrounds as actual managers. Sometimes they made decisions that were not based on reality. Jeff Easley was pegged to do this very prominent cover for a new product and management wanted to make sure it's the best it can be. So they specified, "Jeff, only use your most expensive colors on this painting." Which is hilarious 'cause, like, Rose Madder is the most expensive paint tube so I can imagine if his whole painting was Rose Madder. Another thing that happened along the similar lines is another important project came along and they said, "This project's important. Make sure you use all the colors." So that just kind of gives you an idea of the void between the understanding between management and creatives especially the painters, at TSR. Originally, we got to keep our art. Then somewhere along the way, I'd say right around... maybe 1980 or so, um... they decided that, "Well, we should keep the art, TSR." And those works went into a vault that was found and opened when Wizards purchased TSR. Some of the art got back into the artists hands, but some of it didn't. In the generations that we're talking about, D&Dart wasn't a digital piece on a computer. It was a real piece of artwork and those pieces were everywhere and we're here today talking about them because we love them and we know the value that these things have. But at the time, nobody knew. I get this call from somebody going, "Hey, we were cleaning out the shipping department 'cause they're getting ready for some construction." Or something "We found this painting behind a big filing cabinet and we were thinking about throwing it away, but we figured since it's art, we should call you up and let you know and let-- you could tell us what to do with it." Then I went down there, I was like, "Oh, my God, this is the original Trampier cover. Oh, what is this doing...? Why is this here? Why is this behind a thing?" And totally freaked out. Realizing that we were, like, literally moments away from this thing ending up in a dumpster because nobody in shipping had an understanding of what it was and what the importance was - to this brand. - For whatever reason that boggles my mind, original artwork somehow was... confused for trash. They chucked it away in-- It-- At least three batches that I know of and I did not learn about it until the last batch that they were chucking away. And I--I was out of my mind. I couldn't believe that they were doing this so I grabbed a bunch of that. And if it wasn't for the fact that there were some people who happened to be witnessing at the time that this was happening, that artwork never would have been rescued. ♪ A really good villain, a really complex, dynamic, not purely evil villain is so much more interesting than a hero no matter how well he's fleshed out. I love fantasy art because of the monsters. D&Dwas the first niche to fill the monster market and give us visual evidence of what creatures were that we might have seen or wanted to go against. Now you can go on Google and put in a name of something and do an image search and you can get a million images that'll come up, but I bet you they're fromD&D. WhatD&D did was, just by the needs of the game, demanded an image for every monster. It became sort of a compendium or glossary of every creature that had ever populated any fiction most of which may have never been painted. There was nothing out there for what certain monsters looked like or certain other things, so you had to go by the description. We were just making the shit up. It's like being an explorer. You're the first one who's gone there and you're reporting back to everyone else what that thing looks like. So I had to paint a dragon, the first dragon I ever painted when I went to work at TSR. I'm like, "God, I've gotta paint a dragon." I get my encyclopedia out and I look up dinosaurs in one book. Another book I had reptiles. And a lot of people say, "Well, why you put front legs on a dragon?" You know, you see a lot of dragons with the wings and the front legs tied together. It's like, "Well, because TSR said in D&D, dragons were very intelligent. They could do things, they could cast spells. They need to use the front legs almost like hands." I was always a little intimidated by dragons, though. I hadn't done a lot of dragons prior to coming to TSR and then Dragonlancecame along and we kind of changed the look of the dragons. I got to develop the Black Dragon and the Green Dragon. You know, I think Larry did the White Dragon and the Blue Dragon and Jeff did the Red Dragon. My version of the dragon has evolved a little over the years and I think that eventually got to the point where physically a lot of my dragons are kind of almost human musculature in the arms and so forth and you can get really kind of an expressive gesture. The way I do the faces I think oftentimes, it's almost caricature approach in some cases with the eyes, maybe a little bit of a grin or just the way the nose wrinkles up. Yeah they're just-- of all the fantasy creatures I think they're probably the most iconic. Lockwood really set the bar recently for kind of what's to be expected of dragons I feel. You can't have more fun for money than designing the dragons for D&D. Todd just--he really had a hankering to, uh, just redesign them to make them less humanoid in their anatomy and more feline, more bestial and really gave each one its own really distinct differences. Seeing like the Green Dragon look very different from the Black Dragon look very different from the, you know, Blue Dragon was really inspiring because there was taking into account regions and where these dragons could be found. Sam Wood and I worked very, very closely together on the dragons and traded pictures back and forth and built them up from the inside out. We drew skeletons, we drew musculature diagrams and then we fleshed them out. Pulling in a lot of different textures and colors from real world objects like, you know, for this copper dragon he's got a really nice patina on it, but each, again, each dragon has such a unique head crest and look about it that you can really start to appreciate the culture of each species. Dragons have wings. They don't swing from tree limbs. They don't need shoulders that can brachiate. A cat can't do this... but a monkey can. A dragon doesn't need to swing from a tree. So we gave them limbs more appropriate to the things it would use those limbs for. For me when I'm painting a dragon, when I'm approaching the design aspect of it it's almost like a personality that you have to hit, less so than a physical feature. Like, for me, I'm not aiming for scales on my dragon, that's not important. I'm aiming for majesty. I'm aiming for impact. I'm aiming for this powerful feel to them. The Silver Dragon for Fifth Edition was a real treat for me 'cause they're one of my favorite dragons inD&D. I wanted it to be something that sort of takes your breath away a little bit when you see the beauty of this animal rather than just a monster. You know, something with just a couple of hit points and some loot on it to get later. When I am designing creatures I much more prefer kind of Earth-bound creatures. Like, if it looks more alien, I actually--I don't like that. Because nature looks cool and really anything that you can come up with, nature's already done it. One of the things that-- that is always in the forefront of my mind, you know, outside of the standard art stuff of, you know, "Where's the light source coming from?" And all that is "How do these creatures work? Like, how do they interact with their environments? How do they interact with each other and how can I make that look believable?" I am every monster in all of my work. I use this medium in this forum to do a series of self-portraits. Root the Goblin was one of the assignments that I had to do for Halls of Undermountain and it was one of my favorite self portraits that I've done for Dungeons & Dragons and I really wanted to get a really nice piece of reference that I was going to use to help the piece along. I just wanted to create a really happy, excited little goblin that wanted to help the players out and he's gonna carry all their stuff. As long as you have 90 % of a truth with a monster that ten percent can be as crazy as weird and as much of a lie as you want and you will create something that is believable. So, you know, there's the-- the age old answer of like, "Well, how does that work?" And it's like, "Eh, a wizard did it." You know, it's like, "It's magic." You can... you can delve into the realm of magic. That's what gets me excited about making art for Dungeons & Dragons is that I get to create something that has never existed before. It's an ogre slingshot that's sling-shotting goblins. There has to be some type of guide who says, "All right, sling it." You know? So we have one goblin in there who's kind of like the leader who's saying, "Sling away!" You know? So then he can yank his chains down and sling this goblin covered in spiky armor into an enemy. I hope it inspires the gamer to come up with a scenario that he can put his people up against, to fight this thing. The best D&Dmonsters, I think, are these... the ones that have maintained their uniqueness over the years and that's probably like The Beholder and they're wholly bizarre creatures. The Beholder was just sort of an accident. I seem to have gotten all sorts of credit for The Beholder. And even though I didn't think of it. I mean, Gary probably thought the damn thing up, he just described it to me. You know, ten eye stalks and a big eye and it floats in the air. If you look at the way a Beholder looked in the very first illustration like on the cover of Greyhawk that is one look for that creature, but if you look at the way they're being depicted now, they've got much bigger mouths full of much sharper teeth. And every place where the artist feels that they can make that Beholder a little bit cooler they're doing it. Beholders were terrifying. That was the monster that if it didn't turn you to stone, it could disintegrate you or turn your magic off or just kill you outright with a glance. So when I got a chance to redesign The Beholder forThird Edition, I tried to make him more real and more visceral and scary. And, well, I suppose maybe I pictured a Trampier-like Beholder or maybe I pictured one of the things that had been done shortly before that which was just kinda a beach ball with penises coming out of it. And so instead of penises, they were like slug eyes that would stretch out like a slug's eye and retract. There's nothing phallic about the eye stalks on The Beholder I don't think. Those are just eyes stalks. It's kind of like little animals with eye stalks that get up and look at you. He's just got a lot more of them than most creatures have. Uh, if anything was phallic in anything I did, it would have been Snits because they're just a penis and balls... with feet. A writer of an adventure can come up with a great idea for a monster, but if you make it look dumb it's not gonna have the reputation that it deserves from the writing. So it's, uh-- There's an awesome responsibility - that comes with it. - There's tons of fear messing with those monsters. Especially, like, classic ones because you don't want to disappoint the fans. I don't think the audience forD&D has had any problem with the fact that some of the depictions have changed over time. It's like everything else in a role-playing game. Even the rules there, uh, they're guidelines only at a certain level. I mean, the Game Master is there so that any time the rules fail to do the job, the Game Master can step in and make things work the way it needs to. Same thing goes with the art. Here are all the monsters for D&Dthat we wanna feature in Fifth Edition. These are all the ones that are gonna be relevant. And we went through each one and said "Okay, Owlbear." And then we grab every piece of art we've ever shown of an owl bear of the different major styles, threw 'em up on a board, and then went through this analytical list and said, "Okay, this is what works. This is what doesn't." Through all this work that I've done for the past 20 some odd years has been... there's a certain level of challenge. Like, "How am I gonna make this ridiculous-sounding monster that's a cross between a bear and an owl? How am I gonna make that look cool?" After drawing thousands of creatures, it always comes back to "They have to have a lot of teeth and drool and there should be some spikes somewhere." Like the easiest way to make a creature meaner is to add more horns or spikes. The Carrion Crawler was a bit of a challenge because it's a huge insectoid-like creature that resides in dark places and eats dead things that have kind of ended up there. Of course it kind of made sense at first to maybe have it have large eyes. In my own understanding of the creature, I thought it would be interesting for it to kind of feelaround which the tentacles that were traditionally drawn on the Carrion Crawler could totally do. So that was nice that those were there. So in my final rendition of the creature I've made those tentacles a lot more whip-like in a way, so they're a lot more agile and kind of able to sort of feel around its environment. Cool thing about the Goblinoids what was an interesting challenge was to make them all feel like they're kind of from the same DNA pool. They're all structurally humanoid from the neck down, but where their character is gonna lie, is in their faces. I mean, they all have pointed ears, but they're all varying shape. For the most part their noses kind of lock them in as being--that's the-- the key the carryover that came from that gene pool. The character of the Bugbear is furry, animalistic, ferocious. The Hobgoblin, again, the same nose, kind of the same jaw line, but Hobgoblin had to be more intelligent and the Goblinoids-- Hey, look at him. He just looks like he's gonna steal all your stuff when you're sleeping. Probably cut your throat, too. ♪ These characters, these creatures, these monsters, these places are like a fairy tale or, like, folklore or mythology. They can be reinterpreted over and over again for each generation. And that is incredibly exciting to see. The evolution of the art itself is interesting and almost from edition to edition you can kind of find a little bit of a different template, a different flavor of kind of how the art looks. And I know withFifth Edition, that seemed to go back to a little bit of that earlier--the earlier quality. The direction I'd given to the art directors is I want everything to look like it's been done traditionally. I want it to have love and reverence for the pages again. As Dungeons & Dragons has moved and evolved, I feel like there has been a conscious effort for the game players and the game designers to become more aware of the people playing their games and very conscious in including them and depicting people that look like them. Fantasy in general suffers from being very European and there are so many more amazing cultures and stories and worlds out there that I think are starting to kind of penetrate into fantasy realms. One of the things that the Fifth Edition Players Handbook has received a lot of positive acclaim around is this idea that it's--it's kind of gotten away from some of the design tropes. A really good example of this, I think, is this. The entry for the human race. We have a woman of color in really effective armor. People of all genders, races, everything have always been playingDungeons & Dragons. It's who we start to feature more. When we got the descriptions, they were very adamant. They were like, "Try not to make it like a white blonde guy." Like, "Please, we love 'em, but there's, like, 500 million of them." The diversity that the characters need to have needs to reflect the gaming world now. The mix of people that are playing these games, you know, it's not the, you know, 13-year-old white boys held up in their basements. It's a very diverse crowd. You know, males and females, all nationalities. So, you know, this was a great opportunity to mix that up a little bit. Really thinking about the people that are reading these books and, like, understanding this media and having them see themselves portrayed in that, gives a lot of hope that fantasy can be a genre for everyone. ♪ Dungeons & Dragonsart is important because it has had a tremendous impact on both the imaginative art consuming public as well as the artists who are producing it. WithoutD&D, just eliminating that game, eliminating all of that work, the landscape would look very, very different. There would not be the expectation for this kind of art and of this kind of art that you see today in things like video games orMagic. I don't think it's been everything, but if you look at who's creating these mediums I bet you... that a high percentage of them areD&D players. The artwork has solidified a place in common culture that somehow speaks to the nature of adventure. We've closed all our frontiers, but not in Dungeons & Dragons. At the time I don't think any of us really grasped what a big deal this all was. I was way too busy feeling how lucky I was to have the opportunity to do the kinds of art that I wanted to do. That was what I was thinking about, not, "Hey, 40 years from now there'll be people looking back on this and thinking - of it as historical. - God, it is 40--No, it's 30. No! It's 40 years! I had to do the math. That's crazy! It's exciting to be part of this big universe that everyone knows and everyone's been enjoying for 40 years. It's not kind of exciting, it's really exciting. It's a dream come true. It's something that I never thought I would be here. It was a springboard for my career when what I really was looking for was a lifeline. It turned out to be so much more. I certainly do realize how lucky I am to have been in the right place at the right time and, you know, forge a little bit of the history of the TSR roleplaying universe. I think it's a legacy and it's humbling. Seeing the work that was done way back with TSR and then work that's being done now and in the future, it's only gonna get better and better and better. Being able to contribute to so many people's experience. You know, you're contributing not just to a book that's going to sit on the bookshelf. For me, I'm contributing to somebody's imaginative experience. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination. It's about storytelling. It's about creating something together. And these depictions, these drawings of characters that someone draws on their player character sheet or that aMonster Manual shows us what we're going to fight or a module shows us the room we're about to enter. These are all parts of that narrative. They're all pieces that fuel our collective imagination. And I'm very, very honored and thankful that I got to be a part of that. I'm happy that my art got to pull people into a game or a book that made them happy. I don't feel famous. I don't feel anything. I just feel lucky. I'm still learning and I'm still trying to get... one painting right, you know? ♪
