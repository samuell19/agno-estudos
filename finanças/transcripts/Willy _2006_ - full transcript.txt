The College of Art and Design Zurich Film Department Presents Willy In the right angled triangle it is actually: Cathetus A squared plus Cathetus B squared, equals hypotenuse C squared. Got it? Yeah, almost. Well, actually not really. I think I need Pythagoras tutoring. If you want, I can explain it you again. Yeah, uh... I wanted to ask you something else. Yes, what? Uh..., isn't it disturbing... when they all the time bounce up and down, while running...? Not really. But you know what really bothers me? When the other guys stare so stupid at me in gymnastics: "Hey, she have such big boobs!" I never gaze. You are allowed to. - About Pythagoras... - Hey Baby! After school at the bicycles? Am I interrupting? No, no. Let's go? I think Leander has a new girlfriend. Yeah, sure. Who? The Tittymonster? Which one would you take? Such udders must be great. But with such udders it only fits someone, who has enough in his pants. Do you have than enough? Of course man. How long? Do I have to measure it? Good idea. Give me your protractor triangle. Are you crazy! Give it to me. Give it. Sandro, you start. The one with the longest wins. 9.3. Yeah yeah, standard. 8.5. 12.2. Yeah yeah... 10. Come on, this is such crap. We all measured. Come on, do it for Martina. Do you guys need today an extra invitation? Everybody is waiting for you, what's taking you guys so long? Come on Joni, you can start right away. Sandro. Look, that's not fair, if they are all together in the team. "Look, that's not fair, if they are all together in the team." Do you find yourself cool? Behave guys! Leander. Are you crazy? He is the best goalkeeper. Lea. This tournament is crap, can't the boys just play by themselves? Be quiet please. Leander, it's your turn. Choose Anti. Take me, take me... Choose Anti. Come on. Take Anti. Yes! Yes. Yes. Hello! Are you still throwing? So it's the boys turn to clean up. Do not complain. Pick up the balls, put away the training mats, and then off to the shower. Girls don't fall asleep, go change. Quick. Joni! 3-0... Yeah, I know. How comes you didn't pick me? Simple... Simple what? No not just simple, well, because... Because of the others? They are all idiots. Yeah sometimes they are. And, have they again been staring stupid? Oh, whatever... Wait! We still have to measure... Measure? Nothing. What nothing? Leave me alone. Sorry. But you said, yours is long enough for her. Prove it. What is this all about? Don't listen to them. 11. Does anyone believe that? I don't think so. We need to measure it again. Explain it to her. Well, we have played a game. The one with the longest gets you. Are you crazy? Open your books. Page 47, assignment F 21. Martina, you can come to the blackboard and remeasure it please. Remeasuring Leander. B is 8.5. And C is 12.2. Hey, Leander. I told you she likes long ones. Hey. Actually it's not what you think... Yeah, of course. But you know what, you are just the same one as the others. And your stupid Pythagoras you can learn it by yourself! I'm just telling you so you know. Sandro. You said 11 didn't you? It can't be that hard to do. A quick measuring. So? I said don't shoot the ball that hard. Bruno Banana! Sandro. Just aim at the melons. Joni! Hey, Louis Longhorn! Hey! Willy! Ow! Willy! Don't you want to shower? I shower, whenever I want. Everybody grab Leander! Take his underwear off. Now. Yes! Stop it. It's not funny! Yeah... Let's throw him in the hallway... Call Martina. Martina! Martina! Hey! To remeasure. Because of Pythagoras. The End
