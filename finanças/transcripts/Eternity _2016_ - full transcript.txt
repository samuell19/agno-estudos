ETERNITY Arthur and Julie Bourgeois had 5 daughters. Two of them died young. The other three, Helene, Henriette and Valentine, were married properly. Valentine! At age 17, Valentine engaged with Jules, at the father's request. After reflections, the engagement was broken off. But, Jules was in love and persistent, and therefore got his way. Jules was pure of heart. Valentine, who was known to have the gift of assessing people, loved him to his dying day, and hers. Less than two years after Louis and Jean, Adrien arrived. He was calm and applied, whereas his brothers were rebellious and distracted. In this houseful of men, Valentine was surprised, sometimes, imagining a baby girl. And finally, she came. They named her Margaux, after Jules's grandmother. Valentine loved her like crazy. This resulted in greater complicity with Margaux, the first fruits of a bond of blood and femininity. "Later, you'll get married and have children. But, nothing will change the sweetness of being together. You and me", thought Valentine. Snack time, children! The arrival of Elisabeth satisfied Valentine even more. Dad! Mom! But, the promised life of Valentine, where the perfect trajectory of the early years, had been slowly breaking down. Where all that she had were taken away and destroyed. The first unhappiness, she tasted 3 years before the end of her marriage. When the seventh child lived only one day. For a few hours, he was called Etienne. You will have other children, Valentine. Etienne... We never got to know him. We didn't even get a chance to love him. "Only a man can talk like that," she thought. And she remembered the waiting in vain,... the long months of dreams,... and now that emptiness in the arms,... a missing weight. A hole of warmth, absent. The conjugal life of Valentine and Jules lasted 20 seasons. Pierre was born... and Jules died a year later. His memory was always there. Everything was engraved with her. Its vividness would sometimes turn her pale. She neither lost the pain of knowing he was dead, nor the joy of loving him. In the affliction of knowing the ever unfruitful and deprived of love,... Valentine recomposed. She had only her children to cosset her now. There were parts of Jules in each of the children. Fleetingly, Valentine glimpsed him through them. The twins were shy, as young men without women. Soon, they would be plucked and thrown under the ground. Nobody knew it, not even them. Nor Valentine, who would like to perfect them, without sensing it was useless, without knowing that no woman would have them in their arms. NOTICE OF DEATH Valentine never knew how her sons' faces looked in death. Elisabeth,... Margaux, come here. Open the gate, Margaux. Thank you. I'm such a scatterbrain! Mother... Yes, my dear. And that night, while keeping lone vigil over her child, Valentine had a clear vision of what was waiting for her. A very long life, watching others go, unable to retain them. And once again, she fell asleep unintentionally, to regain strength, which she did not want any more, but which was in her. You cheated! Elisabeth! Mother. Would it feel good to be a grandmother? Is there someone you love? You know her. Mathilde! Yes. I often let myself wait for this. Please know that I am very happy. Do you want to ride a bike with me? Now? Yes. Okay. Hold my fingers. Close your eyes. The engagement was simple and private. In a strange new way, the pain of losing a child pierced through Valentine again. Mother... I've made a decision. I ask you to respect it. I want to be a nun. Are you sure? I'll spend Christmas with you and then I'll go. Give it more thought. Her daughter would not have any children. That thought hurt her. In the room, only Valentina could understand that a line of motherhood ended there. A woman who does not have children lacks the most devastating thing in life. Time passed, Margaux did not change her decision. A strong, willful and secretive young woman... left her loved ones to enter pure and naked, in the austerity of her prayer. She longed to show her daughter what she was giving up. To tell her that a man's love is less distracted than God's love. Her body made of fruition and metamorphoses, became an object of her daydreaming. She was seing it transform under her eyes. While washing it, dried it and perfumed it, she felt as if her gestures now meant something different. Mathilde wanted to tell Henri that this moment was the least important the easiest. After all, everything still remained to be built, or at least, not to be destroyed. She thought about it all... the nights together, the lovemaking, the children that would come, the meals they would share, the two of them, indefinitely face to face, the women he might desire who would not be her, the things she would dislike about him. Henri was, however, a difficult spouse. He had a passionate, yet stiff disposition, combined with the desire for tranquility, which, if contradicted, made him uncivilized and scathing. - Good evening. - Good evening. Henri and Mathilde met with Gabrielle and Charles every day. Since they lived in the same building, it was not complicated to go up or down for the daily ritual chat. Mathilde found a real friend in Gabrielle. And Gabrielle responded in the same strong proportion, this exclusive bond, preceded since childhood, and that demarcated for both of them the discovery of the sweetness in life. Their mothers, who were sisters, little by little, in widowhood, they approached one another, became close again that they shared the same apartment. Mathilde, look here! I found more. In the name of the Father, the Son, of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Gabrielle gave birth to a girl, whom they called Solange. Naturally, Mathilde was the godmother. Also pregnant herself, Mathilde longed to discover the child she was carrying as in this baptism, she held in her arms her friend's daughter. Mrs... Can we baptize her? Yes. Marie,... I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. After delivery, Mathilde felt as if she too had been born. The baby made her, and gave her a place in the immensity of the unknown. Are you happy? Yes. Why do you ask? Because I'm happy and I want you to be, too. The first meeting between Gabrielle and Charles is worth describing. Their marriage had been arranged and was settled over lunch. Have faith. Charles... He is a young engineer and quality man. You will love him. Do you know why we are here? Yes. I know. And do you approve? Yes. Good evening. Madam and Sir are in the bedroom. Thank you, Manu. Yes Good evening. No one today knows what they talked about at the time. They're all dead now. But they were together in the bedroom, which was unusual for them, in those days. I think I will feel destroyed... by the death of the first person among those I love. I do not think so. After having the fifth child, Mathilde had a second miscarriage. But a year later, to her amazement, she nursed her first daughter, Louise. I'll check back later to see how he's doing. Hello, Charles. Alright, François? Mother... She stayed like this until the dawn became the day. And as the light outside bloomed, She suddenly felt motionless and heavy. She knew he would soon be taken from her, because his time had come. François? François? For dinner: - Lettuce cream soup - Small juice pates - Portuguese Tornedor - Stuffed tomatoes - Crepes with... Mother? And then, that's it... She stood up firmer than before. And when you bent down to one of your children, it was with a grace that quivered from her wound. A year later, Margaux died in her convent cell of the same meningitis fever that had taken François. For Margaux, who had given Him her youth and life, God didn't give her the time to see her mother again. You know... at every instant, I can feel it in my hands the size of their fragile shoulders, the thickness of the torsos, the fragility of the arms. They are warm and soft as silk. With their small bodies and sweetness on the faces, they're capable of building ideas to form sentences that delight me. I know the exact color of their hair, the shapes of their bodies, the tint... that comprises their eyes when they're tired. And every day, my hands touch the perfect skin they all have. Mother? Kids, go wash up. What's wrong, Gabrielle? Where's Charles? Mathilde... Charles! Charles! Charles! She always knew they would be separated. That's why they had never been away from each other more than a day of Charles's work. Which side of bed do you prefer to sleep in? On this side. If you do not mind. Gabrielle... I'm not yet ready to say "I love you". In fact, you are not ready to say it either. For now,... we are still strangers to each other. We will learn. Love is never a gift. I know I'm lonely... and quiet... and more a dreamer than most men, I guess. You may not like my table manners... and other thousand pitfalls that are not always important. But if I make you a promise... I will never break it. You'll find it nice. I love that great forehead you have... and your face that does not smile much. I will love you... when your beauty and freshness vanish,... and when other eyes that look at you now, no longer look at you. I will continue to love you... because I have decided to do it many years ago. I'll be by your bedside to close your eyes. And you will do the same for me. Gabrielle, do you want to be my wife? Getting away from this marital heat was difficult. Neither Henri nor Mathilde ever urged her to do so. Not once did they insinuate him to come home. "How sweet it was," Gabrielle thought. "How happy they had been." A few minutes later, he left the herbarium to come and hug her. His heart throbbed with love and desire. Once Mathilde recovered from the birth of Jérôme, she got pregnant again with Christian. This number of months God has chosen to create a life passed over her again, expanding it, illuminating it, making it pale. Mom? Mom, look! How nice! Where did you get it? From that tree, it's a green pine cone. It's like covered with shells. They will open and change color, one day. It's very nice, you should show it to your father. It's beautiful. Mom, do you think I'll have a little sister? We'll know soon. I would like to have a little sister named Marie. Do you also want a girl? However, despite of this immense family, and given that she would soon be 40 years old, she lost the baby again. Of course, Gabrielle never spoke with Henri of the babies that Mathilde should stop having. What right did she have? Mathilde realized that Gabrielle and Louise knew, from the beginning, it would be a girl, Marie. Mathilde said nothing. That baby was her secret. "I can not bear to lose her," Gabrielle thought. Suddenly, life seemed to have immense weight that she could no longer support. Everything was dangerous. Everything was an endless restart by which they would be swept. Marie was born on Good Friday. Attention! And Mathilde died the same day. One... two... three. A few hours after the first cry of her daughter, Mathilde gave her last breath. I would like to see my children. Guy. Louise. Jules. Nicolas. Jérôme. André. Jean. Joseph. I introduce you to Marie, your little sister. Come and kiss her. I have a lock of hair from each of them. I would like to take them with me. Can you take care of that? Louise. It's your fault! I hate you! Feeling the warmth of the baby against her chest, Gabrielle felt she was capable of taking care of them all. Of Henri and his children.

But, he thought he was just a man. I have a complicated request to ask you. I know. The answer is "yes". You want to? Isn't it... a sacrifice? No, it's not. Mathilde and Charles will always be with us. Yes. They are here. Yes. Children? You can come. Solange... You can sit there. Jules... Guillaume... here. André... Here, next to Jean. Nicolas, in the front. Joseph... Here. Louise? Clothilde, Ali, there. Yves,... Jérôme,... at the end. And little Guy... Wait! In your chair. Solange and Jules lost their reasons. They were cousins because of their mothers, they shared the same roof, and were at the age of disobedience. Valentine, who almost tired of life without Jules and death that did not want her, would finally become what I expected... Dead... and in love. For the first time, her sleep was agitated and the pillow was soaked under her head. She was sleeping soundly when her heart abandoned her, alone in her bed. Arthur and Julie Bourgeois had five daughters. Two of them died young. The other three, Helene, Henriette and Valentine, were married properly. Their offsprings were 18 grandchildren. 43 in the next generation, 154 in the third generation, 231 in the fourth, and today, are already 169 in the fifth generation.
