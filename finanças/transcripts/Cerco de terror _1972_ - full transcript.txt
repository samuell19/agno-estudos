SIEGE OF TERROR Marta! Hi, honey. - How was your trip? - Not too good. Should I remind you that I'm your girlfriend? Of course. Why would you say such thing? You were all over her. Don't be silly... - My suitcase. - That one over there? Not that one. - That one. - This one? - Excuse me. Mrs Warren? - Yes. I'm a driver from the hotel. Your husband is at the university, but he told me to bring this to you. Thank you. I'll pick up your luggage. Nick... Excuse me. Ready when you are, madam. Your luggage is in the car. So you're determined to upset me. I didn't know that you... You're so vain, you think you could charm her with just one look. - Don't hold your breath. - You sure? You may be a detective, but you're following a wrong lead. She's Dr. Warren's wife. The famous neurologist who's in town. She's a married woman! - To Dr. Warren? - Yes. - Let me tell you something. - What? Dr. Warren is staying at my hotel. Now we'll have fun. Hey! - You like danger, don't you? - I love it. Not even a kiss goodbye? Aren't you coming in? I've got to go to work, at the hotel. A new job? No, my dear. But don't be jealous. You're the only one for me. I wish I could believe you. I'll pick you up at eight. Any news, Willy? No news, my dear detective. No crime, no robbery. And no pretty new customer. Is that so? What about that one? - Good morning. - Good morning, madam. - My name's Mrs. Warren. - Welcome to Miami. Will you sign this for me, please? We're very proud to have a celebrity like your husband in our hotel. Dr. Warren is in his room. Let me help you out. - I think that's all, thank you. - You're welcome. My pleasure. Fred? - Is it you, Carla? - Yes. Welcome, honey. I missed you so much. I sneaked out of a meeting to come and welcome you. - Anything else, sir? - No, that'll be all. Thank you very much. What is it? What's the matter with you? - I can't take it anymore. - Why? What is it? - It's about Nick. - Nick? Yes, Nick. I've seen him many times, and not only in my dreams. He's chasing me. He was there at the airport today. As if he was still alive. That's not possible. And you know better than anyone. We agreed not to talk about him anymore. You must end this obsession of yours. I want to. But I can't. I can't. Sometimes I think this is my punishment. Do you understand, Fred? Please forgive me for everything. I'll get you something to calm you down. You'll soon be fine. Take this. I need to go to the university now. Please don't go. Don't leave me alone. He may ... Carla, please! You promised not to think about that anymore. Nick is dead. Don't forget about that. No! Please forgive me. I shouldn't have talked to you like that. But I'd rather you remember he's dead than to keep seeing ghosts. Now, you'd better get some sleep. Don't beat yourself up. I'll make sure to be back soon. Fred, are you there? Hello! Hello! Down there! Nothing. There's nobody here, Mrs. Warren. A gust of wind must have knocked a couple of bottles down. I saw a shadow on the door. A shadow? Please calm down, madam. I assure you there's nobody here. - Do you want me to send over a maid? - No, thank you. It won't be necessary. I feel better now. My nerves do flutter sometimes. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry to have bothered you. - Don't worry. Just call me if I can be of any assistance. Hey Sherlock Holmes. If you don't want to see me jealous as a panther, just don't start out with those mysteries. They're only excuses for your love affairs. - Where are we dining tonight? - I'll take care of that. I'll take you to a wonderful place. You'll love it. Of course. Yes, very romantic. All right, but no take-backs this time. You're leaving already? I must be away for the day. How are you feeling? Mighty fine. - I slept heavy. - Glad to hear it. Just seize the day. Go visit the city. Distract yourself. - And don't think about anything. - I won't. I don't have any free time today, unfortunately. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Fred. - Good morning, Mrs. Warren. - Good morning. - Are you feeling better? - Perfectly fine. I'd like to know the city. What should I visit? I can be your guide if you kindly let me. I wouldn't want to abuse of your kindness. I'll be very glad to help. Please... Now you'll meet the famous Flipper, our #1 star. I'm sure you'll like it. - How do you get him to surface? - He does whenever he sees visitors. - So we can call him out? - Oh yes. Flipper! You can try to feed him. I think he wants more. He's really sweet. Bon appetit! - He's very greedy! - Wait... Here... Bon appetit. - He really likes to play. - Indeed. Flipper... Show the ball to him and toss it in the water. You can throw it now. Go get it! - Will he find it? - Absolutely. There he is. Stand up! - Piece of cake! - He's so nice. - Are you enjoying this? - Oh yes. Thank you, Flipper. - Do you like it? - Yes, very much. Hold on tight! We'll see a different landscape now. Okay. You'll now see that there are no obstacles for us. - This is great! - Yes! - I guess you'll like this. - Thank you. - I hope you enjoyed the excursion. - It was great. It's been ages since I felt this way, so peaceful. What prevents you from feeling always this way? You have everything in the world. I'd rather not talk about it. I'd like my whole stay in Miami to be as nice as today. - If I can be of any service... - Much appreciated. - Can we get back to the hotel? - Anytime. Andrew! Keith! Have you seen Marta? Marta? She's been waiting for you for two hours. She left very angry. Thank you. Someone screamed! Where did it come from? It came from room 64. I wonder what might have happened. It has been awful! It has been awful! It's him! It's him! - It's him! - Stop it, Carla! Nick doesn't exist, you hear me? You scratched yourself. Nick did it! Nick... Fred. You got a cigarette? I followed your advice and visited many places. We had a real good time. Well... The hotel's detective came with me. I didn't dare to go out alone. How did you meet him? He came to my room because I had another hallucination. Another one? I heard noises in the bathroom and I got scared. I called reception and he came along. - Did he ask you any question? - No. - Nothing special. - Be careful. Any indiscretion from you can be dangerous. Avoid that man. No one... can know what happened that night in New York. No one can know that Nick ever existed. And that since then... ...we must live apart. It's stronger than me. I'm ill. You must forgive me and be patient. I already have patience. That's why I try to cure you. Hi. I've decided to rent a house by the sea. You'll like it. It's in a very quiet place away from everything. No one will bother us. We'll be able to be happy there once you get rid of your hallucinations. We can't risk making another scene at the hotel. That detective's clued up already. - When do we leave? - Tomorrow. Scenes like yesterday's must never happen again. It would be very dangerous. - Shall I be alone? - No, we'll hire a housemaid. What about you? I'll be with you as often as I can be. Don't worry. I'll only be your doctor. And whenever you're ready... I'll be your husband. - Good morning, Andrew. - Good morning. - Nice flowers. - They're for Marta. A storm to be calmed, I guess? Lovers' follies are the hardest to cure. Take it from a psychiatrist. Marta's in the pool. Go. Hi, Marta. How are you doing? I'd like to apologize for being late to our date yesterday. Late? You didn't even show up. You simply forgot about me. You were in very good company already, weren't you? It was only part of my job, Marta! Well, it looks like it was a very pleasant part. Mrs. Warren's ill with weak nerves and begged me to join her. So you could snuggle her to bed, right? You're wrong. We said goodnight at her room's door. That is so gallant of you. And in the meantime your idiot of a girlfriend was waiting there for nothing. Why can't you believe that my only interest in her is professional? I don't believe you. I wonder where your rotten jealousy will take you this time around. I can't take it anymore. You'd better find yourself another girlfriend. Don't be foolish. - I... - Just cut it out, Andrew! Just remember you just owe it to your job. You're just wasting your time here. We're done. I'm sorry. As you like it. You know what? The hell I care! Are you sure you did the right thing? He's a jerk! He didn't even think I could change my mind. Good morning. My key, please. - Here you are. - Is my wife upstairs? I saw her walking to the pool. Good. We'll be checking out this afternoon. - Are the lectures over? - No, I rented a house outside of town. - Good morning, Carla. - Good morning. - How are you feeling today? - Very well. You can count on me for any trouble you may have. That's very kind of you. I'm sorry, but my husband is a very jealous man. Yesterday I told him I went for a walk with you and he got upset about it. I don't want to annoy him. I've got enough trouble with my nerves already. Carla... One of the best psychiatrist in the U.S., Dr. McGregor, is a good friend of mine. I know that your husband is an eminence too. But a visit with Dr. McGregor could do you good. Just think about it. All right. Carla. Is it true that you're leaving today? - I think so. - I'm sorry to hear that. Hi Carla. Back from the pool? Yes, I sunbathed for a while. How you been back long? Just a while ago. I felt tired and cancelled my lecture. I'd rather check out this afternoon. Are you feeling okay? Yes. Very well. Did you see someone you know? No. No one. Another lady friend of yours? Oh, not at all. I'm free, and to prove it... Which one of you wants to have dinner with me tonight? Not me, you scare the hell out of me. - You? I can't either, just call your girlfriend. I don't have any girlfriend. We had a fight. - Just make it up to her then. - You naughty boy. Why did you kill Nick? I didn't. You know I didn't. It was an accident! An accident! I've told you many times before. And you know it. Don't you? Tell me! Yes. You're right. It was an accident, and this is a secret we both keep. I can't help myself every time I think about it. Please forgive me. Please come in. We'll be better off here than at the hotel. This is a much quieter place, don't you think? This is your room Mine's at the end of the hall. I've got to run now. They're waiting me at the university. We need to prepare tomorrow's lecture. You told me there'd be a housemaid. Of course, I took care of it myself. She'll come by every day from 8 to 6. She's not here now? No, she isn't. But I'll be back soon. No, no and no! You were all over her since she got off her plane. I can't stand that! Why should we make it up? Because it's foolish to break up for such thing. I'm not a fool! You see, dad? He calls me names! My dear, he means that you misunderstood the facts. Exactly! After all, taking a walk with an ill woman is not that serious. Exactly! Sure... She was a very fine-looking woman. Exactly! Have you heard him? I was referring to your father's assessment. If it hadn't been a clinical and somewhat mysterious case... Mysterious? That falls squarely in the field of his professional activities. In the field of his shameless behaviour instead. If she had been an old, ugly woman, you'd have acted differently. I would have acted just the same. I'm only driven by my professional interest. And to prove it to you... Here's an irrefutable proof. Look. This fell out of her bag. That thing looked like a pharmacy. It looks like a very dangerous drug. I assure you that she suffers from a very serious nervous condition. What do you think? I don't know. Let me have a look. You're overzealous, my son. Your boyfriend is a great detective, but he doesn't know anything about medicine. This is no drug. This is a completely harmless sedative. But you'd take this to calm down your nerves, right? - Yes. That's precisely what I need right now. You won't take that garbage, will you? Let her take it. Maybe it'll help her calm down. And you'll both make it up. Poor girl. She's really having a rough time. I don't know about her, but I know I am. It's as if she forgot how to cook. Give in a little, will you? There's nothing I want more. Just try to control your temper! Let's be honest... What's that "clinical case" about...? Do you know Dr. Warren? Of course I do. He's a genius in his field. But he has a very dangerous superiority complex. He makes a bad enemy. So you know... Do it for my stomach instead if you don't want to do it for her. Yes, but if she strangles me, it will be your fault. You can't even imagine how weary some hotel clients can be. Yeah, but you have a great time with them. Far from it, doctor. That's what I like best, specially when they're women... Yes, but... [....] Sometimes... ...those annoying clients... [...] Marta! What's wrong? Marta! Calm down! Stop it! Stop it! - Calm down! - Leave me alone! No! Calm down! Hold her head down! What's wrong with her? What is it, Marta? I think she's under the influence of a hallucinogen. I'll give her an injection. Marta! Calm down, my love! There's no doubt about it. They mixed LSD with sugar. LSD? - What can happen to her? - Nothing. We got her on time. She just needs to sleep for a few hours. But we should analyze this to make sure. Of course. But I'm sure about this. You've seen the effects yourself. Those were classic symptoms. But the label says this is a sedative. That's the odd thing about it. I'm beginning to think that you're right. Mrs. Warren's illness may have some mystery about it. Look at you... She's not answering the phone. I'm worried because she wasn't feeling well. Try it again. Hopefully this time. I'm sorry madam. I scared you half to death. That damned dog is to blame. You know what happened? No. I was in a hurry when I left the house. And I forgot the groceries that I had bought at the market. Some very tasty minced meat steaks, you know? That's why I got back unaware that you had arrived. And the dog ate it all! I was furious! And I wanted to hit him with my broom as a lesson. A thousand apologies, madam. Four... Seven... Five... Six... Yes, I'm writing it down. Eight... Nine... Three. Perfect. Thank you, Willy. Take care. - Where's Marta? - She's sleeping tight. She'll be alright. Did you get anything? Willy gave me the contact details and phone number that Dr. Warren left at checkout. - What are you going to do? - I'll call him right away. I want to find out if she knows what kind of medicine she's taking. Hello? Hello? Excuse me sir... - If you don't need anything else... - You can go. Be more careful next time. The lady is in a delicate state. Carla! To what do I owe this pleasure? If you're home... I can be at ease. Thank you for staying. No! I've tried. You've seen that I've tried. I really wish things were like they used to be. They will someday. I need to make this happen. I cannot fail. I can't help myself. Those memories haunt me. And they stand between us. I can't! I want to heal up, Fred! I need to! - What if I went to see a psychiatrist? - What for? You don't trust me? I know what should be done. Now go and get some rest. Could Dr. McGregor visit me this morning, Andrew? Don't worry. I'll take care of that. I actually tried to call you last night because... Well, I just wanted to talk to you. Where can we meet? Good. I'll be right up. See you. Excuse me... I'm leaving, but if Mister calls anytime, please tell him that I'm resting. - Do you understand? - Yes, madam. Don't worry, that's what I'll do. - See you later. - See you later, madam. Dr. Warren is a medical genius, madam. But he's your husband. And that may be preventing you from obtaining better results. I don't think so. He's the only person that has really helped me. Okay. So please, Mrs. Warren... I hear you. I'm ready. It all started when I first met Fred. He changed my life completely. Carla is making you a millionaire. You're getting your own share of money as well. That's what agents of artists like her would get, don't you think? Now you call yourselves "agents"? The audience is perfect today. Hey! Just make sure she's not always late because of you. Hi. You've been great. Your best performance ever. The doctor couldn't keep his eyes off you. I performed for you. As I do every night. For you only. - This is for Miss Carla. - Yes, sir. - Who's there? - A note for you, miss Carla. Just slip it under the door. Dear Carla, I already told you that tonight was a very important date for both of us. I keep waiting for you in my desk. I need to see you. The minutes seem eternal without your company. Your perpetual admirer, Frederick. It's clear that this man is crazy about you. And he's got millions. It would be foolish to miss them. But he's so weird... If only he'd look like you. There are very few men like me around, darling. So listen to me and go out with him tonight. Okay? Well, if that's what you want... But there's a price for it. He's already waiting for you. Let him wait. And then what? Fred asked me to marry him. I accepted. Only because Nick ordered you to? Also because of Fred, I guess. Nobody ever loved me that way. But you kept seeing Nick. Well, you know... Fred worked a lot and... Yes. I kept seeing Nick. I felt happy with him. And Fred felt happy with me. Everything seemed to work out. But one afternoon, Nick... ...told me to meet him in Central Park. How is that idiot of a husband treating you? - Better than you. - What? Yesterday he told me about a trip to Europe. They've invited him to give some lectures there. But he hasn't made his mind up yet. We need to speed up our plan. If he decides to make the trip we'd have to wait for months. Can you imagine that? We'd be separated for months. What do you want me to do? You're his heiress according to his will. So we must get rid of him. As soon as possible. But things didn't turn out as Nick had planned them for days on end. I see. When the decisive moment arrived, you were incapable of following Nick's orders. That's right. Even though he controlled me, I think I wouldn't have been able to do it. But that decisive moment never arrived anyway. Here's the solution, Carla. Nick... I'm not brave enough to do this. Just grasp it. You must not be afraid of it. See how easy it is? This is crazy! Just point it at me! Pull the trigger! Just think I'm him. And that he's standing between you and me. Take aim. Shoot! Just one final effort, Mrs. Warren. What happened next? I passed out. And when I awoke... my husband was by my side. What did you tell him? I had to confess the whole truth. Everything? Everything. Save for the fact that Nick and I had planned to kill him. Fred loved me more than anything. And he covered it all. He got rid of Nick's body with the excuse of sending some furniture to his house in the country. I don't know how. - Did he forgive you? - Yes, he did. But ever since that night, I have been unable to compensate him as a woman. Our intimacy time is so embarrassing! You need to cure me, doctor! Can you do it? I think it will be easy if you cooperate with me. Firstly, you must forget those flashbacks. Ghosts only exist in legends, Mrs. Warren. And they don't leave a scratch mark like the one you showed me. Nick did it to me! I swear! That's alright. We'll find an explanation for that. Just calm down. You'd better get some rest now. I'll call my daughter to take you home. Marta, please take her home. So how did it go? I still need to clarify some things that come into your territory. My territory? I'll take the car out. See you later. Some Nick appears to her. He was her lover, who died in a strange accident. But the amazing thing is that he even scratched her shoulder once. What do you think of it? I don't believe in ghosts. Are you sure she told you the truth? Yes, she's delusional. But she strongly believes in what she says. Can you tell me more about that Nick character? He was in New York lately. I'd better go back to work. Besides, it's always nice to travel. Nick was always a scrounger. He'd exploit women. I wonder how Carla could have ever trusted him. He had her under his thumb. I don't think she was a bad girl. Have you ever seen Nick again? Nick disappeared when Carla went away. Since she got married, he must be looking for another victim. He was a rat! Please call me if Nick shows up again. I'll have five of these for you. I'd do you this favour just the same. Okay. Thanks for the information. And for the pictures. Bye. Did you forget about the rector's cocktail party? I'd stay here all day long. But don't worry. - I'll be ready in a minute. - Hurry up. Damned dog! Hi. I'm at the airport. The flight is delayed. Yeah, about an hour or so. Okay. I understand. I'll be waiting for you. Okay. See you later. Bye. Human prejudice prevents us from studying that prodigious machine called the brain. How could we study it? By inoculating like a virus, and experimenting with a man or woman just as you would with an animal. By creating a state of mind which could reveal the self-protection of the brain against all the things which tend to destroy it. There are despicable individuals who could be redeemed from their inferiority by using them for experiments of that ilk. But that could turn a sane person insane. That's why I talked about prejudices. You don't share those prejudices personally, doctor? I personally don't. So you're proposing the destruction of a sane mind... for the benefit of science. If it benefits science, it will benefit mankind. Millions and millions of sane minds, Dr. McGregor. It's all theoretical, though. - Dr. Warren? - Yes. - A telephone call for you, sir. - Who is it? He only said "your friend Robinson". If you'll excuse me... I'd forget about my patients if I'd be by your side. - So would I. - You too? I told you not to call me, and specially not here. Is it serious? What? Please don't get your readings wrong. Your heart line is very clear. I'm sorry to interrupt, but we have to go. - Why? - We just need to. Good night, sirs. Good night. Did you see that...? It has been a wonderful evening. - You're leaving already? - Yes, my wife is not feeling well. - Me? It's alright, dear. We're among friends, aren't we? You bet. At your service, madam. - I hope to see you soon, doctor. - Good night. Madam. She doesn't look as sick to leave this way, does she? Definitely not. But if he says so... I'm fine, believe me. Don't lie to yourself. You're on the verge of another nervous breakdown. What are you talking about? A good doctor must know how to make an early diagnosis. I'm sorry if I annoyed you in any way. Stop pretending. You don't need to stay here. My company has always been a burden for you and you don't need to pretend tonight because it just so happens that I want to be alone. The what should I do? Just leave me alone. Finally, there you are. Is the party over yet? Yes, because the Warrens left home early unexpectedly. - Any news about Nick? - That guy? He vanished. It looks like he was a pimp. I wouldn't trust Warren too much either. I see him capable of doing something crazy. He took his wife away in a bluntly, odd way. And he said even stranger things. I think Carla may be the victim of something incredible. I'd better go over to her place. - Bye. - Bye, Andrew. Do you think she's in danger? I wouldn't say that. Why don't we call the police? Why did you kill that woman? She spotted me. She made such a fuss about it that I had no other choice. You've ruined everything. - You'll regret this. - Spare me your threats. I don't like them. I'm sorry about it, but so much time locked down can get on your nerves. The hotel was different. An apparition from time to time, you can withstand. I paid you to withstand whatever it would take. Really? What have you done with the body? Nothing. You're the one who makes dead people disappear. As you did with me. It's a shame that I can't finish my plan as I devised it. - What's stopping you? - Your stupidity. I never thought anyone would die. My revenge was an experiment too. To transform Carla's mind. To make another woman out of her. But there's no choice now. - I'll turn you in. - You will? Yes, for this... And I still keep the tape in which I recorded your conversations in which you and Carla were planning to murder me. Don't be ridiculous! You've got more to lose than me. I can see the press headlines about the outrageous life of Dr. Warren. Let's end this! I can't wait. But the price has gone up now. You pay me more, and I drift away. You make me sick! To each his own. I've always liked the good life. That's why I planned to be your heir. You discovered our plot. But you were ingenious enough to hire me to take revenge yourself. Me. Your own wife's lover. I was an actor on salary. And I let myself be killed so that you could perform your big experiment. But your trick failed. The show was too big. And ever since then Carla has been unable to be affectionate with you. Tough luck. You're the only one to blame. There is no backing out now. You're my accomplice. You're as guilty as I am. But I can choose another solution. - Which one? - To kill you. To kill me? Don't kid yourself. You're just a small man. Fred! Fred! Fred! Nick! This is not possible. It can't be real. Yes, Carla. It's me. - Same old one. - You're alive! Nick! What happened when I shot the gun? Why did you fake the horrible nightmare of your death? Tell me, please! Tell me! Tell her about those brilliant ideas that made me die. Tell her why you hired the only man she ever loved. For a scientific essay. Just admit that you never had a chance to win her heart. You see? Nick! Nick! Oh, Nick! Why? Why did you do it? Why? Why? Because I've loved you. You don't know how much. But no one's allowed to make fun of me! What did you both think? You were wrong about me. I knew it all from the very start. How did you think that you could cheat on me? How could you prefer such a despicable person over me? Everything is coming to an end now. No... No! When I saw your vile intentions, I wanted to transform your miserable brain hoping for a possible cure. I wanted to make a different woman out of you. A new woman. For me only. Come with me, Carla. Andrew! It's alright, baby. Hold on. The usual drama, sergeant. Husband kills lover and wife kills husband. But I think she's not accountable. I swear I'll never be jealous again. I'm glad to hear that, because I saw a redhead at the hotel who was in real trouble. Andrew... ***Fansubs by Sifasol***
