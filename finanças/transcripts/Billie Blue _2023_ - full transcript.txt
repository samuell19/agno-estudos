I'm 16 and as far as I can remember, I've been a late bloomer. I stopped peeing in bed in grade 6, I stopped holding my mother's hand at the mall in grade 8, my breasts sprouted about six months ago, I drank my first sip of alcohol last week, and until 9:18 this morning, I hadn't had my period yet. No, no, no. No. No! No! Uh... hello? Does anyone have... a pad? I use the Diva Cup now. Is a tampon okay? Not really, no. This is all I could find. No way! Well, you either use this or bleed in the pool, bud. So? It feels like I'm wearing a diaper, but otherwise, I'm great. Oh yeah, and I just had a massive growth spurt. You could almost say I'm a giant at 5'9"... and a half. Sunscreen? No, thanks. In the love department, I'm also a late bloomer. I've never felt those feelings that send sparks flying through your belly. I've never seen fireworks in a boy's eyes. I've never experienced life through rose-tinted glasses like in all those songs. But that's what my 16th summer is for: catching up. I can't help but be jealous of other girls. Most of them have already been in love. Once, twice and even three times. I guess that's because they're prettier, and shorter, and less behind in everything than I. Billie! And according to the calculations of a girl who barely scrapped by advanced math, that's unfair. That's it for rules and regulations. Was everything clear? Yeah. Was everything clear? - Yes! - Thank you. So, I'll be on your case today, okay? We have to be polite to our clients. You're only 18 minutes late. Way to go. - It was her fault. - Of course. Okay. Here. No, thanks, I'm okay. We want them to have a nice time so they come back. Let's be welcoming. What did we miss? A fascinating speech about the importance of nametags. Oh, and the classic speech about not rolling up our sleeves or wearing jewelry. And clearly, as always, rules aren't something you concern yourself with. It adds to my appeal. Okay? Girls, please pay attention. The park opens tomorrow. This is no time for chit-chat. Thanks. Now that your sister is the boss's girlfriend, and a supervisor, I hope we get to bend the rules. I just hope she won't be too annoying. I'm not getting a farmer's tan again this year. And now, over to Annette. Hey! So, let's go over your vacation requests... She's perfect. She is, but she's straight. Get that into your head, Jules, protect your little heart. Could we stop labelling people? I thought we'd made progress. You're right. It's true, Annette is perfect. The perfect tan, perfect shiny hair, she's always got a love interest, and she's never behind in anything. More often than not, I wish I was more like her. Sometimes, to make myself feel better, I imagine that my favourite writers, like Marguerite Duras, Colette and Simone de Beauvoir, were also late bloomers. These women make me want to write. And currently, my muse is this fledgling summer. Hello, ladies! What? Seriously? But I just refuelled. If you put in five bucks at a time, of course, you're constantly on empty. Don't complain. You should've saved up to buy your own car. - Refuelling is expensive. - Okay. Stop thinking about the end of summer. Keep your sadness for when you're in Montreal. - Live in the present! - Okay... I'll miss the scenery. You mean this scenery? Yes! You're my favourite scenery. BILLIE BLUE Sorry, we don't accept cards for less than 10 dollars. Can't you make an exception? I can't. You'll either have to pay cash or buy something else. Yeah, I get it. What crap could I buy to bring this to 10 bucks? This. I won't be long. Look, pay for my slushies and I'll pay you back. There. Is that enough? Will you give me a discount since I'm on the front page? I put in five bucks at pump 1. THE EASTERN TOWNSHIPS RECRUIT TRIUMPHS Thanks. Here you go. It probably cost you more or less this much. Thanks. That's nice of you. - Here. - Thanks. Let's take the same path as last time! What was that? I was paying for our slushies. Long story. - Who is he? - I don't know. - Here you go. - Thanks. My father's been nursing a broken heart lately. Our mother left him six months ago. We decided to stay with him this summer, so he wouldn't be left alone with his sadness. Dad? He splits his time between his work as a doctor and his new passion as a bachelor-in-denial... Dad! ...Dark Metal Combat. Dad, we're talking to you! Oh! Hi, girls! Sorry, I didn't hear you come in. How are you? - The last day of training went well? - Yep. Did you put sunscreen? Of course. What are we eating? I thought I'd make you... pesto pasta. Cool. Same as yesterday. And the day before. No, no... No, no, no... - Okay, okay! Let's take a picture? - Yes! Yeah. IMPLICITLY CHARMING Thank you! Billie, you didn't use sunscreen. Will you lay off with that? I want a tan. Your technique won't work. Think cancer. What were you talking about? Rosine not enjoying sex. Really? I made love with Dom three times and I got nothing out of it. At least you're not a virgin anymore. Virginity is a social construct that reflects our patriarchal society's morals. And Juliette is right, once again. So, are you going to stop making love? I don't really know... Let's just say I don't understand why there's so much hype around sexuality. Sex is never fun at first. You just have to practise and be patient. Cool. How romantic and reassuring. I mean, I fooled around with the girl who works at the concession stand and I had fun. It's different when it's two girls. You're so right, buddy. You'll see, you'll enjoy it eventually. Do you feel different after doing it? I guess I feel more like... a woman. That's not what makes you a woman. Jules, could you turn down the woke while we share sex stories? We're not trying to change the world, we're chatting. Rosine? - Thank you. - Cheers! Ciao. No. I can't wait to desire someone. I can't wait to make love, to feel the weight of a body on mine. Apparently, your belly feels warm, and it feels like you're freefalling. If only someone would catch me, their arms breaking my fall, infusing a touch of magic into my summer. One, two, three! - Hey, I'm good! - Yeah? - Be right back. - Okay. Are you spying on me or just daydreaming? Uh... I... I was spying. Cool. Spy away. It's fine with me. Why were you talking to Pierre Forêt? - Who? - Pierre Forêt. The cycling champ. I stared at him too long. He thought I was being weird. You are weird. Do you know him? No. But he's part of the maintenance crew this summer. - Hey, ciao. - Bye. - See you soon. - See you. Bye! Yeah, soon. I'll stick around for a while. Okay, bye! Bye, guys. JULIETTE: WHERE ARE YOU? ROSINE: WE'RE OFF TO EMILE'S. MEET US THERE. ANNETTE: I'M HEADING HOME. DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING TO EMILE'S. I'm going. Bye! - You're spying on me? - No, I'm watching you. It's not safe to walk around alone at night. Says the creep who's following me, whistling. You don't like Joe Dassin? - Joe? - Joe Dassin. Oh yeah, sure! - The best summer song. - Totally. Want a ride? On your bike? Yeah. Now, that's unsafe. I'm a cycling champ. You'll be safe. Cool, you're humble too. So, how do we proceed? Give me your bag, put your butt up here and we're off. - Ready? - Yeah. Don't worry, I've got you. Summer poem #1: Hair flying in the June breeze The night drags on Alongside a stranger with pool-blue eyes I learn to fly Thanks for the ride. My pleasure. Anyway... Annette. Come on, Annette, wake up. I want to tell you something. Annette! Leave me alone! What are you doing in my bed? I didn't want to sleep alone. Okay. Why not? Émile dumped me yesterday. Oh, no! How come? He said that... being my boss and my boyfriend isn't ideal and that there's no use being together if I'm leaving for Montreal in the fall. I mean... ...he's not wrong. Come on! He just wants to be free to sleep with whoever this summer. Okay, well, we hate him then. ANOTHER WIN FOR THE EASTERN TOWNSHIPS RECRUIT Girls, I'll be at the ER all day. If you want to reach me, call the hospital, I won't have my cell. Got up on the wrong side of the bed or did you have one too many rum and cokes? Okay, I won't push it. Shall we have dinner together tonight? I think we're working late. Sometimes, I forget you're at that age where doing things with your dad isn't cool anymore. Well, since you'll be home alone, why don't you try Tinder instead of Dark Metal Combat? - Have a nice day. - Bye. Love you, girls. We love you too. Summer poem #2: Your eyes, Caribbean sea and blueberries, Your hair, golden halo, field of wheat and buttery popcorn, Make me want to love you Even though I don't know you Ma'am? Ma'am!? Can I go? Sure, buddy, go ahead. - Can we go? - Go ahead. Ready? Three, two, one, go! Go ahead. You too. Billie at Whirlpool to Rosine at Rafting. Go ahead. I fell asleep and a kid just woke me up. I just ate a poutine at 10:15 in the morning. I'm going to check in with Juliette now. Ciao. Ciao, bud. Billie at Whirlpool to Juliette at Tarzan Swing. Go ahead. You alive over there? I just had to comfort a lady who did the biggest belly flop ever. Ow! How was the rest of your night? Not bad. Adonis-on-two-wheels gave me a ride on his bike. Who? Pierre Forêt? Shh, Jules! It's a code name! Don't reveal his identity on the walkie-talkie! Oops! Sorry. Girls! The walkie-talkies are for emergencies only! You dumped my sister, so you don't have a say all summer. 10-4, boss. The park must suspend its activities for the next 30 minutes because of thunder. Thank you for understanding. - Yo! - Shit! You scared me. Sorry. Your lips are blue, Billie. Oh, I was drinking a slushie. Where'd you hear my name? It's on your shirt. Of course. I'm an idiot. You're not an idiot. And Billie's a nice name. Thanks. - Pierre is... - Pierre is...? It's... Go on, I'm listening. It's... vintage? Is that a polite way of saying I have an old man's name? I guess so, yes. My parents are the nostalgic type. They're really quite blue. - It was a super-sized slushie. - There you are, Billie! Émile's looking for you. The park just reopened. We need people at Rafting. Maybe the boss could just calm down. That's what I told him. The Enchanted Forest's pH is off. It needs checking. We had a brown code this morning. I can't do miracles. - Have you seen Billie? - Yes, I have. Dammit... Wait! Ow! Summer poem #3: My heart, bright red Maybe from a sunburn Or maybe love painted it red Now it beats, fast as a bicycle Flying down a country road Whose serpentine curves invite you to make love You're in better spirits than this morning. Émile slipped and broke a tooth and knowing he's in pain is making Annette very happy. It was blissful! With a front tooth missing, he might not hook up much this summer. Poor guy. Don't spoil my fun! Juliette told me you got a ride from Pierre Forêt? And you didn't tell us about it? Actually, there have been further developments. So, earlier... It's actually great that I'm not with the toothless guy anymore. I feel like enjoying the single life this summer also. How right you are, Annette. And... summertime's all about experimentation, right? If I ever want to explore, I'll let you know, Juliette. No offence, Jules, but... I might already have a man in my sights. Some guy in maintenance. The cycling champ? Yeah. He's pretty cute. He'd make a great rebound. He's not really your type, though, is he? You hate cycling. But I like winners. Shall we go? Can I bother you for a minute, Billie? Sure. Oh, you were writing? Just a little poem. Could I read it some day? Maybe when I get published. I'm worried about your sister. Émile broke up with her? Yeah. He's an idiot. She confides in you much more than me. I just wanted to make sure she's okay. Annette gets over guys pretty easily, so I'm not worried. - Dad? - Yes? Who is Joe Dassin? He was a French singer. Why? Just curious. Okay, Dad! Dad! We've had no surprises so far. Competing today, veteran cyclist, Thomas Martin, who has five provincial championships under his belt, and our young local star, and latest recruit, Pierre Forêt! He quickly made a name for himself this year despite being quite green and starting his career later than most. Did you know Annette would be here? Nope. You have to talk to her. Are you crazy? No, I'm just being smart about this. If you don't talk it over, you'll just both end up getting hurt. - Yep. - Have you seen my sister? Weren't you saying the other day how perfect she is? I can't compete with her for a guy like Pierre. - You're really selling yourself short. - Totally. You say that because you love me. No, because I'm also smart. All eyes are literally glued... Hey, girls! Hi! Impressive burst of acceleration by Pierre Forêt. He is now alone, in the lead. But we haven't seen the last of Martin. The end of this race promises to be exhilarating! Tension is running high in the crowd. Spectators have picked a favourite, and judging by their chants, I'd say it's Pierre Forêt. Let's see if Forêt can pull it off. Victory is at hand! But here comes Martin with the help of his teammate, who is working hard for his leader. Martin is pedalling furiously. He's riding swiftly. It's what he has to do to catch up to Forêt and qualify. He's giving it all he's got. And here you have it, they're neck-and-neck. This is going to be down to the wire. Martin confidently launches into the final sprint. Forêt crouches over his handlebars. Forêt tries to pass Martin on the right... Oh! And he's down! Pierre Forêt is down. Martin dashes to the finish line alone. He is joined now by the medical team. Pierre Forêt seems okay. He's slightly banged up. What a disappointment for Pierre Forêt who was mere metres away from victory and from being chosen to compete on the national team. It'll be for next time! You sure you don't want to go to the party? Yeah, it's always the same thing: guys drink, girls cry, and in the end, no one's happy. You're totally right. I don't want to turn into one of those girls, okay? Check this out. We're missing out on Pierre drowning his sorrows. No big deal. It's not the end of the world. Hey! Cycling is his life! It's his end of the world. You're in love with him, aren't you? I don't even know what it means to be in love. It means having that look on your face when you're thinking of them! Yep. And feeling things you've never felt before. I'm breathless when I think of him. And I feel giddy. I'm hot and cold at the same time. And it hurts, but it also feels good... You are in love! Yeah. But so is Annette. So, I have to let this go. I don't think so. You have a choice here, either you let love pass you by... or you fight for it. That's nice. Thanks. Your cardio's not bad for a girl who doesn't exercise. I save people in a wave pool all day long, what's that if not exercise? All you do is work on your tan. Yeah... I guess. But check out this tan. I give it a 10. Thanks. - You're not getting that? - Nah. My sister's probably just looking for me. What does she want? - That's your sister? - Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Kiss me then. Want another beer? Uh, sure, okay. Good idea. - Here you go. - Thanks. So, you've been to BC? Yeah, I hitchhiked out there. How'd you like it? It was great. Everything was very different. It wasn't what I'm used to. Annette? Do you want a ride? I'm heading your way. - Sure. - Yeah? It's a ride, Émile, nothing else. Thanks for the ride, bud. Are you sure you don't want to sleep over? Yeah, I'm really tired. I think I'll just go write a few poems. Okay. We love you. I love you too. Pierre! It's not safe to walk around alone at night. Hi, Billie. - Where are you heading? - To the store to buy beer. Get in, I owe you a ride. No, thanks. I'm trying to sober up. Okay. Well, enjoy the walk. Billie, wait! Actually, screw the beer. Should I drop you off at home? Yeah. Thanks. It's on Mountain Road. Take the road to the water park, it's right by there. Are you tired? Not at all. I'm not either. What should we do? Want to go swimming? Need a hand? Of course not. Come on. Does it hurt? Not really. I'm used to it. Why are you so into that Joe Dassin song? It used to be my parent's song. It's a beautiful love song. I listened to it a few times. Do your parents still love each other? No, they don't. I think they might actually hate each other. Shit. That's sad. Bah. They weren't made for each other. My dad's heartbroken over my mother. That's not cool. So... shall we go in? You're beautiful, Billie. Thanks. And you have long legs. That's not very common. Yeah, they go on forever... Guys don't usually like that I'm so tall. They feel intimidated. - That's what my mom always says. - She's right. And... you don't feel intimidated? Are you coming in? What? Are you scared? No way, I'm not scared. I promise I won't look! I'm sorry. No, that's okay. Are you okay? Are you sure? I'm cold. Yeah, it's pretty chilly. - Shall I drive you home? - No, I'll walk, it's not far. - You sure? - Yes. - Billie. - Yes? Are you... Have you ever... done anything? Done anything? I mean, are you a virgin? - Why? - Because... Because what? - I don't want to be your first. - Why not? I'd rather not be that for you. - "That"? - Your first. Okay, but I don't care. Billie, if I'm the first guy you make love to, that's who I'll always be for you. Wouldn't that be weird? No. Actually... I wouldn't mind that at all. I should go. Bye, Billie Blue. Billie Blue? It's your new nickname. Billie Blue. Summer poem #4: I think I know desire now It's like being out of breath in a deep pool It's struggling to stay at the water's surface It's keeping your head out of the water so you don't miss one kiss Breathless from being in love ANNETTE: YOU HOME? CAN WE SLEEP TOGETHER? I'M NOT DOING SO GREAT... Why is it taking you forever to answer? Come on. Thanks for taking on the big-sister role lately. I promise I'll get back to it soon. Is this about Émile? No. I could care less about him. Well... at least your heart's whole again. But it's still fragile. Pierre gave me the cold shoulder earlier. I think he felt bad because of the race. Yeah, that must be it. I really like him. I don't know why. Anyway... I'm lucky to have you. If you're not ready in 3 minutes, I'm getting a cab. I'm going as fast as I can. You're here for at least half an hour. How's your little heart? Not so great. That Émile Chartrand had better not screw with you. - Émile? Oh, I'm over him. - Already? Yeah. Why the long face, then? Wait for me in the car. - I'll be right there. - Okay, but hurry up! If we're not out of here in 30 seconds, you're assigned to the Enchanted Forest all summer. Come on! Everybody ready? Have fun! - Rosine! You're so lazy! - Seriously? You're so mean! Billie, catch. No. I don't want it. - Just put it on. - Yep. Let's go. - I'll do it. - Girls! - Hello! - Hey, how's it going? - Good. - Rosine! Thanks. Don't forget my shoulders. Is there anything better than two girls rubbing each other? Excuse me? Oh, come on, beautiful, don't get angry. I just wanted to make you smile. - Well, you got it! - Bye! - Disgusting. - What an ass! You told off a client? Well done. Juliette, I didn't expect that from you. Juliette did the right thing. She's right. I had to do something. So you gave them the finger? You think that's the right way to handle it? Put yourself in our shoes. We see this kind of guy every day, they're here to get an eyeful and make gross comments. - And we're not allowed to defend ourselves? - Yeah! Did you ever think that we roll up our sleeves during heat waves because we don't want to walk around in our swimsuits while those disgusting bastards tell us we're cute, when we're just minding our business. Is it really that hard to understand? It really isn't. If that man is allowed back in, I quit. Me too. Me too. Come on, girls, we did nothing wrong here. You're really rocking the one-front-tooth look, by the way. - You ready? - Yes! If it isn't Billie Blue! Billie Blue, how cute. What are you guys doing here? Day off from work and training. Lucky you! - Can I go? - Yep. Okay, go ahead. Farewell, Billie Blue! Last night was fun. Really fun. Can I have your number? Yeah, of course! - I have nothing to write it down with. - Oh yeah, sorry. Here we go. It's waterproof too, so swim away. It won't come off for quite a while. I'm fine with that. Okay, you're up. Sandrine, I just wanted to say... That you like me? - Why would you think that? - So, you don't? Well, this is kind of awkward, but... yeah, I do. PIERRE: HELLO BILLIE BLUE. BILLIE: HELLO. PIERRE: COME TO MY PLACE. BILLIE: LIKE NOW? PIERRE: YES, I WANT TO KISS YOU. BILLIE: I WANT THAT TOO. I'M COMING. PIERRE: 354 MOUNTAIN ROAD, THE BROWN CHALET. Annette! Annette! - Annette! - What? Have you seen my razor? I threw it out. It was disgusting. Do you have another one? No, I wax now. Why? I was going to shave my... legs. But anyway, never mind. Where are you going? To Rosine's house. To do what? We're going to take some pictures, post them to Instagram and watch the "likes" come in. Big night ahead of you... Yeah. What are you up to? I'll probably just be on my phone until I fall asleep. Wicked. You look hot. Yeah. We're taking photos. Have fun. Hello? - Hi. Uh, Billie? - How's it going? Good. Are you on your way here? Uh... why? I didn't text you those messages. The guys are drunk and they were screwing around on my phone. I just saw the messages they sent. Oh, I totally knew. Don't worry. You're on your way, aren't you? No, I'm not. I'm so sorry. They're idiots. It's fine. I hadn't left yet. Billie, I can hear your car. Look, just come over, we'll hang out and you can sleep over if you want. No, it's all good. - Billie, I-- - Never mind, Pierre. Damn it. Another beer, Pierre? Guys, you're dumbasses. Oh, come on, it's hilarious. What's wrong, Billie? I just want to be alone. - Did you and Rosine fight? - No! - Why are you crying? - Leave me alone! Okay. Fine. Hello? I'm out of gas, can you come pick me up? Between Sévigny Road and Dandurand. After the curve. How long? Can't you come any more quickly? Okay. Thanks. Car broke down? How perceptive. Billie, I'm really sorry. It's okay, Pierre. Really. But it was very embarrassing. I'd even dressed up all pretty. You're always pretty. Pierre, what are you doing? Come on! Listen, why don't you drop by tonight? For real, this time. I'm sure you want to. - I do! - Okay, so we're on then? See you tonight, Billie Blue. And then she wonders whether she's in love. I'm happy you've finally accepted it. I've accepted it, but I'm still keeping it from my sister. Stop feeling guilty. You're allowed to experience this. And your sister's constantly hooking up. It's your turn now. What are you going to do tonight? I don't know. I bet they'll kiss all night long. And maybe make love. Maybe. He said he didn't want to be my first. He'll change his mind soon enough. Yeah. I think I'd be proud it'd be him. I don't think I'd regret it. It's up to you, Billie. You're early. Yeah, I guess. I walked over from Rosine's house. Did you tell her you were coming over? No. Okay, cool. Come in. Billie Blue! Shut up, Sam. They're kind of stupid. You've won so many. What do you want to do? We could kiss. Good idea. You sure I'm the one you want to do this with? Yes. And you're okay? Yes, I am. Keep them on. It's pretty. Are you alright? And now, are you still okay? ÉMILE: WANT TO HANG OUT TONIGHT? WHY NOT? Summer poem #... whatever: I made love. Or maybe I just had sex. It's unclear. Because what I'll remember isn't the thrill of pleasure, but rather, his body on mine, his hips rocking back and forth, his breath on my neck, the smell of his skin. And the startling pain will be with me for a long time. I don't feel more like a woman. I'm the same Billie I ever was. I'm playing two nines! - You can't do that. - Yes! It's a double! Nah, you can only put one down. Okay, jack. Joker! I'll take that joker and play my nine. - Now's the time. - I'm playing my joker... What are you doing here? - Uh... nothing. I... - Is Pierre still sleeping or is he coming up? You make me sick. Annette! Annette, wait! Let me explain! I can't believe you hooked up with Pierre when you know I have feelings for him. Why'd you do it? Because I'm allowed to live too, you know! If only you'd stop being jealous of me, maybe you'd live more. By the way, Billie, that guy doesn't give a shit about you. For once, someone is paying attention to me, can't you let me enjoy it? You just can't accept that a guy would pick me over you, finally! I'm so sick of you having it all and leaving me nothing! Anyway, when we kissed after his race, it didn't seem like he'd chosen you at all. Summer poem #6: My tears ease the sun's burn. All at once, it feels sweet and painful. Like making love, I guess. The summer's sorrows make their way down my freckled cheeks. Girls! Girls! Wake up! Come on, wake up. Well, I won't be this summer's Best Employee. No, but I think you might tie with me for Best Friend. I completely agree. She's really angry, isn't she? - Hey. - You're on maintenance now? For today. - Uh... Billie? - Yes? Uh... about yesterday... I don't want you to get any ideas. No, it's no big deal. I mean... we slept together, that's it. Yep. That's that. But it was cool. Very cool. You two seem to have had quite the day. Okay, could someone please tell me what's going on? Everything's fine, Dad. Yes. Everything's great. Talk to me, girls. Billie, why don't you tell him about your night? Last night, I realized that my sister can't accept that she's not the centre of the universe. Hm, weird. You left out the part where you lost your virginity to someone who doesn't care about you. - Annette! - Go to hell! Billie, don't talk to your sister like that! Seriously? You're taking her side again? Are you done always putting her before me? Do you ever consider that maybe I've been hurt too? Of course not, you're too busy worrying about Annette. - My heart can get broken too, you know! - Billie, come back here. Too little, too late! WANT TO HANG OUT? Can I come in? No, I'm sleeping. Billie? Where are you going? What about you? Don't use that tone with me, please. I'm going out. On a date? Yes. She's just a friend. That's a little much. The tie, I mean. Yeah? I trust you. Have a nice night! - You too. - Okay, I'm ready. - Finally. - You're beautiful. - With or without the make-up. - On to business. - Yep. Jules, you're Melanie, 26 years old. And you are Marie-Julie, 24 years old. Do I look like a Marie-Julie to you? No. But you're almost 6-feet tall. It makes up for the name. And what's your name? Rosine, 19 years old. That's so unfair! Why do you have an actual ID while I'm stuck with someone's library card? Because I paid 100 bucks for mine. - Huh? - What? I think it was a worthwhile investment. Thanks, Rosine, for risking your life so we can go to a bar. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Cards, please. I knew it would work. - 26 years old? - Well, of course. - Marie-Julie, 24 years old. - Melanie. Come on. Who's she? I don't know. Billie, stop staring, it's unhealthy. Yeah, it's pure torture. Did he even see you? I sure hope not. Because if he did and he didn't come over, ouch. But you haven't gone to see him. It's not the same. Find a way to get his attention. Buy him a drink. Nobody does that. Why don't you just... walk over and say "hi". Because he's busy gawking at another girl. She's so annoying. Oh, don't go there. She doesn't know that Billie's into him. - Pierre's the ass right... - He's not an ass! He's not being straight either. Do what you have to do or you'll lose your place. That's how things go in our generation. People get sick of one another way too quickly. Love is about making grand gestures. - You're not wrong. - Thanks. Okay. One last brave soul? No one? Oh, come on. One last song before we take a break. Yes! Give her a round of applause! What? What song will she choose? Billie, hold up! Let's give her a round of applause. What was that? You're being so intense. Yes, because I'm in love with you. - You're not in love with me. - I am. I love you, Pierre. That's why I didn't want to be your first. Who cares about that? I loved you before we slept together. But I don't love you, Billie. I'm sorry. It'll be okay. - He's an ass. - Yes. Everything will be okay. What time are we leaving? I'm leaving in 5 minutes. Get your own ride. - What? - Come here. - I'm going to be late. - You're early. That's not like you. Come here. I owe you an apology. I'm listening. You're very sensitive. You're so in touch with your emotions that I trust you to figure things out, I don't worry about your feelings as much as your sister's. And that's my mistake. I shouldn't take it for granted. You deserve for us to talk about how you're feeling, for me to keep myself informed about your little heart. And I know you have a lot to teach me, Billie. Really? Three broken hearts under one roof, that's rough, but we have to take care of each other, support each other. How long does it take to get over a broken heart? Because I don't want to spend the next six months playing Dark Metal Combat. Well, maybe instead of video games, you could focus on writing. Yeah, that would help. But I'd rather not go through this too often. It really hurts. Love... whether it's your first love or the love of your life... ...can die or fade away. No one is safe from experiencing that pain. I know it's bleak, but I'd rather be honest with you. But you can take it. It's not like in the movies, is it? Nope. It isn't. But it's beautiful while it lasts. Is it worth it? Absolutely. Love, real love, is rare. Take it when it passes. And together, we can get over anything. As long as we talk. Summer poem #7: My heart may be broken into thousands of pieces, but my love lives on, warming my belly. It wreaked havoc and still does, but I don't have the strength to try to control it. Rosine at Whirlpool to Billie at Wave Pool. Go ahead. It's really packed today. It's intense. Totally. The pool's overflowing. I can't keep eyes on everyone. Have you and the Adonis-on-two-wheels spoken since the other night? Negative. And your sister? Doubly negative. My sister's need for attention is so blatant that she just made up a rescue. Really? She's putting on a show; this is Baywatch and the guys are loving it. Nobody's drowning? No, it's just some guy flailing about to get her attention. Breathe. I'm here. I'm here, Annette. Look at me. Look at me. Breathe, Annette. Slowly. Slowly. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - I was so scared! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Billie. Hey, Annette. Are you okay? She's fine. I just wanted to check in. That must've been really terrifying. Yes, indeed, it was. Luckily, Billie was there to save me. Uh... Billie, can we talk? No, I'd rather stay here with my sister. Yeah, I get it. Juliette in the Enchanted Forest to Annette in the Lounging Area. Go ahead. Gigantic brown code over here. We need someone ASAP. I'm sending our best right away. We'll be waiting. It's really massive. Summer's final poem: My 16th summer has been colourful, to say the least. Blue, like Pierre's eyes, the bottom of a wave pool, and my tongue after sipping a frosty slushie. Red, like my heart, beating for a boy, but also, bleeding because of my complicated relationship with my sister. And finally sparkly, for all the firsts which have almost made me a woman. And now, onward, to discover new colours. - Hey. How's it going? - Good, you? - Bathing suit. - Yes. T-shirt. Thanks. Thanks. Hi, Pierre. Haven't seen you around in a while. I had a race in the States. I got back yesterday. Well, you didn't miss much. - Billie, I... - You know, Pierre... Go ahead. It's fine that you don't love me. I swear. And... thanks. What for? Thanks to you, I realized that nothing is more important than my sister. Not even "my first." Put the bag up there. - Here? - Yep. Perfect. Ready? Pretty much. I made you a going-away gift. I made one for you too, Dad. It's everything I've written so far. And at first, it was just meant as a gift, but it did me a lot of good. I'm proud of you, Billie. I'll read it over and over. It's the best going-away present ever. Okay, go on now. My Dark Metal Combat game awaits. - Take care of yourself. - Bye, Dad. - Call me when you get there. - Promise. - Bye, drive safely. - See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow, Billie. Love you, girls. Annette's going to Montreal to stand on her own two feet, and as this summer ends, I look ahead eagerly. I may be a late bloomer, but I'm done wasting precious time seeing my sister as a rival. I'll always be there for her. She'll always be there for me. No matter who we fall in love with, no matter who we become as women, despite any feuds or life challenges that leave us hurting. Bye, ladies! Hey! Whoa! Eyes on the road! - Your tongue's blue! - So is yours! Okay, okay, eyes on the road. BILLIE BLUE Oops. Sorry. Oh, my God! You're a supervisor now... Sorry! - I was wondering! - That was great acting! Girls. I'm sorry, they're cracking up. Will you give me a discount? Sorry! - You have to stop this! - What's my line again? Sorry! Well, I wonder if it's a cut. Subtitling: difuze Cut! Cut slate. I can't wait to see that on a 65' screen. - You're ridiculous. - Scene 57-2, take 1. Tail slate. Well done, everyone! That's a wrap!
