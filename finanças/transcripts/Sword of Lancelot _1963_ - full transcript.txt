your standard here the full strength of your allies I'll see you Lancelot your counsel needs me here whilst you do battle I am no king to sit on a throne and let my Knights to my fighting sire your prowess in battle has been sung too often to need defending as well as your courage but it is only you our Sovereign Lord on this aisle who can command the allegiance and instant obedience of our several allies I cannot deny however unwillingly the worth of your argument and of your counsel Lancelot choose those you will have at your solid in this perilous undertaking leave with me half our ready force so that if need arise we here will not be defenseless Eric Ryan accessories you to my chambers down below we will have further parley Lancelot for you I could not let you leave without one

mine I couldn't pass a sock how could hire my sweet no kadai lucky Lancelot I'm a blunt man but no words or witch defense with ya words enough today get to the point I came here to escape words and sly looks or tameka's softer words and gentle looks as I to the point I have points and blades enough waiting for me now without adding your studio list mine wait only for your enemies no matter who or what they may be I shouldn't have doubted you even for that moment I have lost track lately of friendship and if you are the little things like duty loyalty honor I know not what to do if you ever

since you were seen weeping at the Queen side when she was being carried to Camelot prison and in the town many of our Inlet oarsmen duck in the windows others are gathering to watch the burning you two go in tears for the faithless your pardons are my soul is for my brother Gareth in your own trouble state I did not wish to impose my grief on you what happened he was carrying no arms because it was Lancelot he merely sought to hold him on the stairs as you had ordered Lancelot killed this is a son like a Lancelot I knew as all the rest of this Lancelot was hard pressed he struck blindly right to left he drove Lewis I have doubts even knew that he'd fail Gareth in all fairness the way even through tariffs blood is on his head sire I had two loyalties now I have but one the other is turned into I hate to ski knows your own eyelid I know it seems that love and hate us of closer kin Oh the sharpest sword and separate one sire let me lay siege to joyous Gard before Lancelot escaped

United Britain that we have built at such a cost to hold it in peace as long as I may the autumn I heart you know how often I urged you not to take when aver in marriage it was a love I could never be

but Gawain he knows how well you loved him and Gareth he must know in his heart you never meant to slam in the dark and the heat of battle quiet must your tongue keep pace with your appetite sorry Loretta fides I don't need your apologies no your lame attempts to kill me keep your counsel I'll keep mine and do follow me up when I go let me be let me be Stern colored as well as traitor and a session Lancelot power I say a word gabbi's black Thor Wayne the pardon sir I never knew Lancelot to refuse a challenge I do a challenge Lancelot week after week to make this a personal matter rather than one for always blood Liddy it refuses to fight either of us yet I cannot believe it cowardice it is very simple sir to struggle in Lancelot loves you birth to well to race or directs against you these are not distinction these are just poor arrows honest and boiling oil from the walls it's an odd show of love and loyalty you and I received a new entrenchments going and the progress of the boots your Lisa come on close the tent decadent there's a cold wind thank you what blood is that the blood of a lad from Camille Yard have you gone through hell enough without taking on this role of

he died with his head in my lap he's not the first nor the last two will died and go and change that down you look like a nun I might as well be one as far as you're concerned it's our little love story over two turned to stone Ian difference difference got in hand agree you've scarcely spent it all alone with me I live in a dungeon of silence and evasion meanwhile lads like dick and die for us while you brood on Knightly honor and refuse to take the one way to our freedom and killing the Wayne and Arthur would mean our freedom freedom is there a land so distant that I can find freedom from the sorts which world night and day in my heart and brain I love you grin but I loaned them already more than I can bear do not I beg you I beg you do not ask me for further dishonor what this honor would lie in accepting their challenges meeting them fairly man to man you'll be risking as much as they toured Gawain all he knows now if the good man is he's never could hold it all against me it would be plain assassination I cannot they'll have no mercy on you or me if they stop us out if that is all we're waiting time will not race or the games are not my words I will not race or against our fate meet my life and if it means mine if you love to be you take to one way out and win a new chance for us it's in your hands you can give us life and happiness with one blow of sword Rex enough perhaps right there's no other way I will end this poly when tomorrow when Gawain comes I'll meet him and then Arthur I'll send him a challenge which he cannot refuse let nothing stop you but even the fires of hell run and change I have no fear for you no man can stand against you if you want your life Dewayne get back your insults and meet that you know in your heart I never meant to kill gasps

changed I know not how or why and I prayed for other things for the Peace of your civil and mine and for God's forgiveness and for his love and now I know that the light which the church speaks up which many men seek all their lives I have seen brightly shining and I will follow that light until I die and beyond you too will find that light if you try in your own way in God's good time your gentleness is harder than any steel I have no weapons against a charmer is there no way through for me to reach your love the best purr spell I've been told that I must leave forever boy 2 what my
