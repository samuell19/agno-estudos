Pour me another drink. Give up, Jack, you can't win. Shut up and keep playing. Come on, Jack. Anyway, that son of a bitch went up the alley. Show me what you got, cocksucker! What are you sayin'? You know you ain't gonna win, just give up. - What do you got? - This hand's mine. And of you fellows looking for pussy today, or are you just got to sit around and scare away all my regulars? No need for hostilities, Mister. We're just looking to get shit-faced drunk. Now, pour me another drink. And let us go about our business. You best quit eyeballing me right now. Or you're gonna end up face down in the quagmire out front. Now, don't be causing no trouble now. Best you get to wherever you're goin' before we find ourselves ill acquainted, friend. I don't like the tone in your voice. And I ain't your fuckin' friend! We'll be on our way when we decide to be. You hear me, cocksucker! What I tell you about manners, Jack? Every goddamn time we get to a new place, you gotta go and rub folks the wrong way. Just for once, is it really such an inconceivable proposition that you not invite the propensity for hostile transgressions? I'm sorry, Ace, I didn't... Now, I think it'd be best if you apologized to Mister... Green, Chester Green. And it's quite all right, sir. Allow me to un-rattle the cage. Next rounds on me, fellas. Now you see, Jack. That's how we address Mr. Green and all fellow proprietors, gamblers, drunks, or any other cocksuckers we encounter from now on. You understand? Yes, sir. Get up. You fellas from around these parts? We go where the work is. What kind of work would that be, Sir? What's your name, Mister? Morning, Sheriff. Coffee for me. Might you pour it pretty please, Mr. Green. Sure thing, Mr. Sanderson. What's the latest on the new bank they're building down a ways? Well, apparently some square head from Montana is putting up the coin, and he'll be here within a week. That's good. Here's to progress. Well now, Chester. It sure seems like the standards to which you usually uphold in regards to the quality of the patronage here sure has declined of late. Now, Nigel, please dispense with all superfluous incivilities towards these gentlemen. Gentlemen? I find it hard to see any gentlemen here, Sheriff. Look more like a bunch of lowlife rabble to me. The kind you and I almost invariably have trouble with sooner or later. Easy now. These men have done nothing wrong, and I don't believe their intentions to be misguided. You listen to your boss now, Mister. And you best change your fuckin' tone the next time you addressin' us. There won't be a next time you keep spouting off like that, son. Easy now, Nigel, let's take the air. We got a busy day ahead. Y'all have a nice day. One moment, Sheriff. If I may ask, who's the marshal around these parts? We ain't got one. Mr. Sand and I are the only law in this camp. Why do you ask? Well, I was just wondering how safe it was around here, and who it is that's gonna take care of me and mine while we are staying. If something unfortunate was to transpire here, who would come to our aid, sir? Surely it can't just be you two protecting all of Blackwater from any inequitable contentions? Well, that sure sounds like a troublemaker to me. Sound like a troublemaker to you, Gill? What I tell you, this son of a bitch ain't here for no picnic! I wouldn't do that if I was you. Goddamn, sons of bitches! Come on now. Why are you asking me this, and who the fuck are you anyway? I, sir, am king of the castle. Come on now, old man, let's play! We got us a old one! Come on! We gettin' him, Sheriff! Look at the boy! Look at him, Sheriff! He lookin' good. - Listen up, everybody! - That's your boy! There are new rules in this camp. Now the priest today is simple. We are now in charge. Remember the name, Ace Dalton. That's who you gon be answering to from now on. If you want to stay alive. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. How's that apple pie coming along, Betty? Imma check on it now, Miss Daphne. I was just running some water out to the cattle boys. You're too good to them, you know that? Mm-hm, but those good, hardworking boys, Miss Daphne. Don't you forget them, I'm not. Anyways, I can smell the apple pie from over here. Smells so good, don't it? Mm-hm. You know, we sure are lucky to have you, Betty. Mm-hm, I know. Who's that over there? State your business. I do beg your pardon, Miss. It was not my intention to alarm you. My name is Balthazar de la Croix, at your service. This is my horse, Honey. Pleased to meet you, Mr. de la Croix. But I ask again, state your business. Of course, of course. I'm looking for a nearby camp around these parts by the name of Blackwater. I believe it to be somewhere in the vicinity. I have an acquaintance there that I wish to parlay with. Quite embarrassingly, I seem to have fallen off the trail somewhere, along the line. Well, Mr. de la Croix, it appears you've taken a wrong turn. Blackwater is about three miles east of here. My my, how absentminded of me. I'd be much obliged to you, if you could point me in the right direction. Well, Mister, how about you come on inside, and I'll draw you a map? Hell, Betty's cooking some of her famous apple pie, that'll make your mustache twirl. You're more than welcome to come on in and have a cool drink and a bite to eat, if you like. The name is Daphne. Daphne Sanderson. Well, Miss Sanderson, if Betty's apple pie is indeed as good as you say it is, it'd be my absolute pleasure. What a marvelous home you have here, Miss Sanderson. Thank you, it belongs to my family. My daddy built this place before I was born. It's been my family residence ever since. How wonderful. Is Mr. Sanderson still residing here? I would be honored to meet him. Actually, he lives in Blackwater now, but he comes back home to visit, regularly, of course. Well, if I ever get there, I'd love the pleasure of meeting the man myself. I expect you will, he's the sheriff. Fascinating. I trust y'all are happy with your apple pie? Betty, you have outdone yourself again. Absolutely delightful, Mademoiselle. I've never tasted any better. Well, sir, you may have a second helping. So, Mr. de la Croix, may I ask what business you have in Blackwater? You mentioned something about parlaying with someone there? Indeed, I have an old friend by the name of Reverend Patrick Flanagan. I believe he's the camp's minister now. One would say the we're boon companions from many, many moons ago. I'd like to rejoin his acquaintance. Well, once we're done here, I'd be happy to ride with you, show you the way. Oh, Miss Sanderson, I couldn't possibly trouble you any further. It's no trouble at all. I was fixing on visiting Daddy today anyways. Betty! Could you be a doll and get David to ready the horses? We'll be riding out shortly. Yes, Ma'am. So, what do you do for a living? Oh, Miss Sanderson, I couldn't possibly... Miss Daphne, I just seen Herschel riding up the pass, and he's riding mighty fast. Herschel, what's wrong? Betty. I'm sorry, Miss Sanderson. It's your Pa. Betty. Get my rifle. Oh Lord, render onto them a recompense, according to the work of their hands. What's the matter, preacher man? Never seen a gutless dog hanging from a tree before? Now, you show him some respect, he was a decent man. There's a dead man, priest. Keep taking that tone with us, you'll be joining him. You, you demons. Why don't you go back to hell where you come from? You savage monsters. Demons send you to hell. This is a man of God, you stupid son of a bitch. Never strike a man of the cloth. Or may your corpse burn for 1000 years. Boss. You two assholes are supposed to be on lookout. Not wandering round here, threatening the locals. Now go on, get to it. I said, get to it! You'll get yours, preacher man! Apologies, Minister. My men can get a little rambunctious at times. Well, it's up to me to remind them to refine their etiquette. Where I come from, a man that commits such a sin will be severely dealt with. Be careful. I may have saved you from a beatin' just now, old man, but don't think I would hesitate in carrying out said action, you keep testing me. Now, the end come upon thee. I send my anger upon thee. I will judge thee according to thy ways. Don't be plotting no insurgent designs, or they will quickly get shut down. You just keep your head down, and do as we say, and you won't be answering the call of St. Peter just yet. Now. I have a meeting with the sheriff, and I dare not keep him waiting. We have women today. I gotta shave my beard. That shit's fun and all, but I ain't a complete asshole. Yeah, well, I was watching the road, asshole! Fuck off! Hey, at least I don't look stupid in that hat, cocksucker. I look as pretty as a pair of dog's eyes in this! Get down. Shit. You heard what the boss said. That bitch could shoot a pimple off a horse's ass at 500 yards. Come on. All right! Right there. Put your hands up real slow like. What the hell do you think you're doing? Don't you know I'm the Sheriff's daughter? Yeah? Well, that's good 'cause pretty soon you and him, little lady, are gonna be having a catch up. You get down off those horses real slow like. Slow like molasses. Move it! You too, fancy man! Gentlemen, maybe we could come up with a mutually beneficial arrangement. Not an arrangement you're gonna be making. It's better we play with you now or we give you to Ace, and he ruins our fun. Yeah. I don't know, Leo. This one here, she kinda pretty. Look like could be a queen. You know what I mean? Who are you? My name is Balthazar de la Croix. This is my companion, Miss Daphne Sanderson. Now, her father is the sheriff of Blackwater. We were on our way there just now when these road agents stopped us. Is that true, Miss? Are you the Sheriff's daughter? Yes, sir, but could you kindly not take aim? I'm still in shock. My name is Benjamin Billings, and I'm a bounty hunter. I've been trying to track down a wanted man, goes by the name of Ace Dalton. I believe these cocksuckers probably worked for him. I agree, Mr. Billings. I've reason to believe the camps is in peril. One of the townsfolk informed me not more than an hour ago that my daddy was in trouble. Thank you, Sir. You're a gentlemen indeed. It seems we got ourselves a situation we can agree upon. That camp is in trouble right now. And I expect you two will assist me on this endeavor. I intend to systematically alleviate Blackwater of these cockroaches. Leave the leader to me, I need him alive. Excellent. Shall we travel together? Carefully. You never know how many of these assholes are waiting to get the jump on us up the road. We ought to proceed on foot from here on in. I'm acquainted with the priest. What better sanctuary than the house of the Lord? Can we trust him? Sir, he's a man of God. Known too many men of God to entirely trust that alone. I can vouch for Reverend Flanagan. He's been a family friend since I was a little girl. All right, Miss. But we can't afford to be conspicuous. I know the camp well. I'm confident we can get in without being noticed. All right then. Mr. Billings? Thank you. Give up, Jack, you haven't won a goddamn hand. Just keep playing. You really think you gon beat me? Come on. We both know I'm gonna win. Come on. Show me what you got, cocksucker! Goddammit! Every fuckin' time! Don't be a sore loser, Jack. How long we gotta stay in this shithole, anyway? For sure, once Ace gets back, he'll know where the gold is, and then we'll be living like kings. Y'all want to keep your voices down? What? We don't need every pinhead in this town knowing what the fuck we're doing here. Y'all understand? Yeah. Yeah, I get it, Dutch. Hey, and don't drink so much. You need to keep your minds clear. The chances are we could be riding out as soon as this evening. What can I say, sheriff? It had to be done. The only reason you're still drawing breath, is that I need you to tell me the whereabouts of that gold you buried in them hills north of here. See, I know all about that fortune you stashed away. So, you might as well just tell me where it is. And I won't cut your goddamn throat. Ah ha, so that's what it is. I suppose you think you've won because you've successfully commandeered this camp without sustaining any casualties on your side? The problem is, Mr. Dalton, success without integrity is failure. And I can promise you this. Y'all will fucking hang for what happened here today! Yeah. But I thought as much. However, I'm sure there's someone else who can assist me in this matter. Someone like your friend, the priest. Or maybe that lovely daughter of yours, perhaps. Patrick, you old drunk! I should have known I woulda found you sequestered in some desolate corner of the Lord's house! Balthazar! Ah! What are you doing here? Quick, Billy. Now, they didn't see you come in, did they? I don't believe so. Excuse me, Reverend, the sheriff is my father. Could you tell me where he is? You? You're Daphne, ha, my goodness. I haven't seen you since you were a small child. My father, please, Reverend. Where is he? I'm afraid they do have him, but I do believe he's alive. Who has him and where? The men I've been tracking, Miss Sanderson. They're here. This is Mr. Benjamin Billings. He's a servant of the court. He's here to claim the bounty on those assholes. And we need to help him do it. There's far too many of them, no. They'll murder us all! Not if I have anything to say about it. I agree, we need to take action. Is there another way out of here, Reverend? You best open this door right now! And I mean right now! Or we'll knock it down and drag you outta there. You and I are gonna have a little powwow, priest. All right then, have it your way. Hello, ladies. Somebody get the mortician. Looks like I got him a few fresh customers. Dutch, we need to get outta here! Dutch! I'm so happy you're okay, Daddy. Take more than a pack of wild coyotes to keep me down, darling. If I'm not mistaken, it may not be time to breathe easy just yet. He's right. Dalton will return and no doubt accumulate an association of fresh gunmen. So, what do you suppose we do about it exactly? I mean, we don't have enough guns to win this fight, and the camp, well, it's mainly just farmers, and they're not fighters. We fight! And it's not about winning, it's about doing what's right. Ain't you afraid of getting killed, Sheriff? Hmm, I wouldn't be in this job if I was afraid of that, Chester. - Do we suppose Mr. - Billings is gonna come back? That I cannot say, but Daphne, you oughta be getting home. That's impossible, Daddy. I'm not going anywhere. I mean it, Daphne. They can't operate without you there. And it's too darn dangerous for you to stick around here. I'm staying right here. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you ever again. Damn it, Daphne, I love you, girl, but you gotta do what I tell you. Now get on back to the ranch. Mr. de la Croix here, go with her. You'll make sure she's safe, won't you? You have my word, sir. Daddy, I am well and truly big enough now to look after myself. I don't need no babysitter. You are going home. Mr. de la Croix here is going with you. And now's a good time to go while there's still some daylight left and that fuckin' bounty hunter has 'em on the run. I love you, Daddy. I love you too, kiddo. I promise I'll come and visit you tomorrow, right after we sort this mess out. Okay. Now, Sheriff. How can I help you in this darkest of evenings? Well, I'm sure they will return, Padre, and when they do, we need to be ready. And I'm gonna need to take some drastic measures to ensure the future safety of this camp. Now what would you be proposing to do there now, Sheriff? That passageway under the floor from here to the saloon, is that still safe to use? I cannot figure why you'd want to be going down there. Gotta be a dozen or more barrels of moonshine under that saloon, down in the cellar. Highly flammable. And I know you were a fighter in your day, Padre. I just hope you kept up with your training. Now, surely you're not saying what I think you're saying. I'm saying it. Sheriff Sanderson, now where were we? Oh, that's right. You're about to tell us where that fortune is buried. But first, I'd like to give you a gift. Looks like Mr. Billings won't be claiming that bounty after all. I'm willing to go into specifics if you're willing to come inside and talk. Dutch, take the air. I want you to keep an eye out. Don't want anyone sneaking up on us. I had faith in you, old man. I knew you'd come around eventually. So, I tell you what you want to know, and you and your men leave Blackwater for good? No longer shall you harm or be the harbinger of terror, as it is by my hands that you shall find peace, brother. God rest your wicked soul. I'll take another drink first. No need to expend yourself, Sheriff. Chester Green! Bring over a bottle of whiskey and two glasses! It's all right. I'll get it. Gotta be a dozen or more barrels of moonshine under that saloon, down in the cellar. Highly flammable. May God forgive us all. What the hell was that? Cockroach! That slimy son of a bitch! Where you goin', old man? Where you goin', old man? - I'm dying, Daph. - No, no! It's up to you now, girl. You gotta keep this place safe, and all the good folks here. I know you can do it. Here. No, Daddy. Take this. It's the map to our gold. That's what they were after. It's yours now. All of it. I love you, kiddo. Can you sing that song that ends with... Lorena. I love you, Daddy. And I love you too, kiddo. It's time, Daphne. Daphne! Daphne, come on over here! I love you, Daddy. And I love you too, kiddo.
